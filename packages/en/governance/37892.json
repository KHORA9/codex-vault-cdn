He threw himself into the\r\nstruggle, resolving to devote himself to the interests of the country\r\nand of society, and he was one of the first among those whole-hearted,\r\nsingle-minded men who endeavoured to keep the Republic within a wise and\r\nmoderate course by steering clear of the two-fold perils of Caesarism on\r\nthe one hand and revolution on the other. A dangerous and thankless\r\nenterprise, of which the difficulties were never hidden from a mind so\r\nclear-sighted as his, and of which he soon foresaw the ephemeral\r\nduration.\r\n\r\n     [1: At the age of 34. Alexis Clerel de Tocqueville was born in\r\n     1805 at Verneuil. His father was the Comte de Tocqueville, who was\r\n     made a peer of France and a prefect under the Restoration; his\r\n     mother, _nee_ Mlle. de Rosambo, was a grand-daughter of\r\n     Malesherbes. Alexis de Tocqueville was appointed an assistant\r\n     judge, and in 1831 was sent to America, in company with G. de\r\n     Beaumont to study the penal system in that continent. On his\r\n     return he published a treatise on this subject; and in 1835\r\n     appeared his great work on American Democracy, which secured his\r\n     election to the Academy of Moral Science in 1839 and to the French\r\n     Academy in 1841. Two years earlier he had been sent to the Chamber\r\n     as deputy for the arrondissement of Valognes in Normandy, in which\r\n     the paternal property of Tocqueville was situated; and this seat\r\n     he retained until his withdrawal from political life. He died in\r\n     1859.--A.T. de M.]\r\n\r\nAfter the fall of his short-lived ministry, which had been filled with\r\nso many cares and such violent agitation, thinking himself removed for a\r\ntime (it was to be for ever) from the conduct of public affairs, he went\r\nfirst to Normandy and then to Sorrento, on the Bay of Naples, in search\r\nof the peace and repose of which he stood in need. The intellect,\r\nhowever, but rarely shows itself the docile slave of the will, and his,\r\nto which idleness was a cause of real suffering, immediately set about\r\nto seek an object worthy of its attention. This was soon found in the\r\ngreat drama of the French Revolution, which attracted him irresistibly,\r\nand which was destined to form the subject-matter of his most perfect\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time, while Alexis de Tocqueville was also preoccupied by\r\nthe daily increasing gravity of the political situation at home, that he\r\nwrote the Recollections now first published. These consisted of mere\r\nnotes jotted down at intervals on odds and ends of paper; and it was not\r\nuntil the close of his life that, yielding to the persuasions of his\r\nintimates, he gave a reluctant consent to their publication. He took a\r\ncertain pleasure in thus retracing and, as it were, re-enacting the\r\nevents in which he had taken part, the character of which seemed the\r\nmore transient, and the more important to establish definitely, inasmuch\r\nas other events came crowding on, precipitating the crisis and altering\r\nthe aspect of affairs. Thus those travellers who, steering their\r\nadventurous course through a series of dangerous reefs, alight upon a\r\nwild and rugged island, where they disembark and live for some days, and\r\nwhen about to depart for ever from its shores, throw back upon it a long\r\nand melancholy gaze before it sinks from their eyes in the immensity of\r\nthe waves. Already the Assembly had lost its independence; the reign of\r\nconstitutional liberty, under which France had lived for thirty-three\r\nyears, was giving way; and, in the words of the famous phrase, \"The\r\nEmpire was a fact.\"\r\n\r\nWe are to-day well able to judge the period described in these\r\nRecollections, a period which seems still further removed from us by the\r\nrevolutions, the wars, and even the misfortunes which the country has\r\nsince undergone, and which now only appears to us in that subdued light\r\nwhich throws the principal outlines into especial relief, while\r\npermitting the more observant and penetrating eye to discover also the\r\nsecondary features. Living close enough to those times to receive\r\nevidence from the lips of survivors, and not so close but that all\r\npassion has become appeased and all rancour extinguished, we should be\r\nin a position to lack neither light nor impartiality. As witness, for\r\ninstance, the impression retained by us of the figure of Ledru-Rollin,\r\nwhich nevertheless terrified our fathers. We live in a generation which\r\nhas beheld Raoul, Rigault and Delescluze at work. The theories of Louis\r\nBlanc and Considerant arouse no feeling of astonishment in these days,\r\nwhen their ideas have become current coin, and when the majority of\r\npoliticians feel called upon to adopt the badge of some socialism or\r\nother, whether we call it Christian, State, or revolutionary socialism.\r\nCormenin, Marrast and Lamartine belong to history as much as do Sieyes,\r\nPetion or Mirabeau; and we are able to judge as freely of the men and\r\nthe events of 1848 as of those of 1830 or 1789.\r\n\r\nAlexis de Tocqueville had the rare merit of being able to forestall this\r\nverdict of posterity; and if we endeavour to discover the secret of this\r\nprescience, of the loftiness of sight with which he was so specially\r\ngifted, we shall find that, belonging to no party, he remained above all\r\nparties; that, depending upon no leader, he kept his hands free; and\r\nthat, possessed of no vulgar ambition, he reserved his energies for the\r\nnoble aim which he had in view--the triumph of liberty and of the\r\ndignity of man.\r\n\r\nInterest will doubtless be taken in the account contained in these\r\nRecollections of the revolutionary period, written by one of the\r\nbest-informed of its witnesses, and in the ebbs and flows of the\r\nshort-lived ministry which was conducted with so much talent and\r\nintegrity. But what will be especially welcome is the broad views taken\r\nby this great mind of our collective history; his profound reflections\r\nupon the future of the country and of society; the firm and\r\nconscientious opinions which he expresses upon his contemporaries; and\r\nthe portraits drawn by a master hand, always striking and always alive.\r\nWhen reading this private record, which has been neither revised nor\r\ncorrected by its author, we seem to approach more closely to the\r\nsentiments, the desires, the aspirations, I was almost saying the dreams\r\nof this rare mind, this great heart so ardently pursuing the chimera of\r\nabsolute good that nothing in men or institutions could succeed in\r\nsatisfying it.\r\n\r\nYears passed, and the Empire foundered amid terrible disaster. Alexis de\r\nTocqueville was no more; and we may say that this proved at that time an\r\nirreparable loss to his country. Who knows what part he might have been\r\ncalled upon to play, what influence he could have brought to bear to\r\nunmask the guilty intrigues and baffle the mean ambitions under whose\r\nload, after the lapse of more than twenty years, we are still\r\nstaggering? Enlightened by his harsh experience of 1848, would he have\r\nonce again tried the experiment, which can never be more than an eternal\r\nstop-gap, of governing the Republic with the support of the Monarchists?\r\nOr rather, persuaded as he was that \"the republican form of government\r\nis not the best suited to the needs of France,\" that this \"government\r\nwithout stability always promises more, but gives less, liberty than a\r\nConstitutional Monarchy,\" would he not have appealed to the latter to\r\nprotect the liberty so dear to him? One thing is certain, that he would\r\nnever have \"subordinated to the necessity of maintaining his position\r\nthat of remaining true to himself.\"\r\n\r\nWe have thought that the present generation, which so rarely has the\r\nopportunity of beholding a man of character, would take pleasure in\r\nbecoming acquainted with this great and stately figure; in spending some\r\nshort moments in those lofty regions, in which it may learn a powerful\r\nlesson and find an example of public life in its noblest form, ever\r\nfaithful to its early aspirations, ever filled with two great ideas: the\r\ncult of honour and the passion of liberty.\r\n\r\nCOMTE DE TOCQUEVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART THE FIRST\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER I                                                       PAGE\r\n\r\n  Origin and Character of these Recollections--General aspect of\r\n      the period preceding the Revolution of 1848--Preliminary\r\n      symptoms of the Revolution                                     3\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n  The Banquets--Sense of security entertained by the\r\n      Government--Anxiety of Leaders of the\r\n      Opposition--Arraignment of Ministers                          19\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n  Troubles of the 22nd of February--The Sitting of the 23rd--The\r\n      New Ministry--Opinions of M.

And it seems to me that the best use I can make of my leisure\r\nis to retrace these events, to portray the men who took part in them\r\nunder my eyes, and thus to seize and engrave, if I can, upon my memory\r\nthe confused features which compose the disturbed physiognomy of my\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nIn taking this resolve I have taken another, to which I shall be no less\r\ntrue: these recollections shall be a relaxation of the mind rather than\r\na contribution to literature. I write them for myself alone. They shall\r\nbe a mirror in which I will amuse myself in contemplating my\r\ncontemporaries and myself; not a picture painted for the public. My most\r\nintimate friends shall not see them, for I wish to retain the liberty of\r\ndepicting them as I shall depict myself, without flattery. I wish to\r\narrive truly at the secret motives which have caused them, and me, and\r\nothers to act; and, when discovered, to reveal them here. In a word, I\r\nwish this expression of my recollections to be a sincere one; and to\r\neffect this, it is essential that it should remain absolutely secret.\r\n\r\nI intend that my recollections shall not go farther back than the\r\nRevolution of 1848, nor extend to a later date than the 30th of October\r\n1849, the day upon which I resigned my office. It is only within these\r\nlimits that the events which I propose to relate have any importance, or\r\nthat my position has enabled me to observe them well.\r\n\r\nMy life was passed, although in a comparatively secluded fashion, in the\r\nmidst of the parliamentary world of the closing years of the Monarchy of\r\nJuly. Nevertheless, it would be no easy task for me to recall distinctly\r\nthe events of a period so little removed from the present, and yet\r\nleaving so confused a trace in my memory. The thread of my recollections\r\nis lost amid the whirl of minor incidents, of paltry ideas, of petty\r\npassions, of personal views and contradictory opinions in which the life\r\nof public men was at that time spent. All that remains vivid in my mind\r\nis the general aspect of the period; for I often regarded it with a\r\ncuriosity mingled with dread, and I clearly discerned the special\r\nfeatures by which it was characterized.\r\n\r\nOur history from 1789 to 1830, if viewed from a distance and as a whole,\r\naffords as it were the picture of a struggle to the death between the\r\nAncien Regime, its traditions, memories, hopes, and men, as represented\r\nby the aristocracy, and New France under the leadership of the middle\r\nclass. The year 1830 closed the first period of our revolutions, or\r\nrather of our revolution: for there is but one, which has remained\r\nalways the same in the face of varying fortunes, of which our fathers\r\nwitnessed the commencement, and of which we, in all probability, shall\r\nnot live to behold the end. In 1830 the triumph of the middle class had\r\nbeen definite and so thorough that all political power, every franchise,\r\nevery prerogative, and the whole government was confined and, as it\r\nwere, heaped up within the narrow limits of this one class, to the\r\nstatutory exclusion of all beneath them and the actual exclusion of all\r\nabove. Not only did it thus alone rule society, but it may be said to\r\nhave formed it. It ensconced itself in every vacant place, prodigiously\r\naugmented the number of places, and accustomed itself to live almost as\r\nmuch upon the Treasury as upon its own industry.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the Revolution of 1830 become an accomplished fact, than\r\nthere ensued a great lull in political passion, a sort of general\r\nsubsidence, accompanied by a rapid increase in the public wealth. The\r\nparticular spirit of the middle class became the general spirit of the\r\ngovernment; it ruled the latter's foreign policy as well as affairs at\r\nhome: an active, industrious spirit, often dishonourable, generally\r\nsober, occasionally reckless through vanity or egoism, but timid by\r\ntemperament, moderate in all things, except in its love of ease and\r\ncomfort, and wholly undistinguished. It was a spirit which, mingled with\r\nthat of the people or of the aristocracy, can do wonders; but which, by\r\nitself, will never produce more than a government shorn of both virtue\r\nand greatness. Master of everything in a manner that no aristocracy had\r\never been or may ever hope to be, the middle class, when called upon to\r\nassume the government, took it up as a trade; it entrenched itself\r\nbehind its power, and before long, in their egoism, each of its members\r\nthought much more of his private business than of public affairs, and of\r\nhis personal enjoyment than of the greatness of the nation.\r\n\r\nPosterity, which sees none but the more dazzling crimes, and which loses\r\nsight, in general, of mere vices, will never, perhaps, know to what\r\nextent the government of that day, towards its close, assumed the ways\r\nof a trading company, which conducts all its transactions with a view to\r\nthe profits accruing to the shareholders. These vices were due to the\r\nnatural instincts of the dominant class, to the absoluteness of its\r\npower, and also to the character of the time. Possibly also King\r\nLouis-Philippe had contributed to their growth.\r\n\r\nThis Prince was a singular medley of qualities, and one must have known\r\nhim longer and more nearly than I did to be able to portray him in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although I was never one of his Council, I have frequently\r\nhad occasion to come into contact with him. The last time that I spoke\r\nto him was shortly before the catastrophe of February. I was then\r\ndirector of the Academie Francaise, and I had to bring to the King's\r\nnotice some matter or other which concerned that body. After treating\r\nthe question which had brought me, I was about to retire, when the King\r\ndetained me, took a chair, motioned me to another, and said, affably:\r\n\r\n\"Since you are here, Monsieur de Tocqueville, let us talk; I want to\r\nhear you talk a little about America.\"\r\n\r\nI knew him well enough to know that this meant: I shall talk about\r\nAmerica myself. And he did actually talk of it at great length and very\r\nsearchingly: it was not possible for me, nor did I desire, to get in a\r\nword, for he really interested me. He described places as though he saw\r\nthem before him; he recalled the distinguished men whom he had met forty\r\nyears ago as though he had seen them the day before; he mentioned their\r\nnames in full, Christian name and surname, gave their ages at the time,\r\nrelated their histories, their pedigrees, their posterity, with\r\nmarvellous exactness and with infinite, though in no way tedious,\r\ndetail. From America he returned, without taking breath, to Europe,\r\ntalked of all our foreign and domestic affairs with incredible\r\nunconstraint (for I had no title to his confidence), spoke very badly of\r\nthe Emperor of Russia, whom he called \"Monsieur Nicolas,\" casually\r\nalluded to Lord Palmerston as a rogue, and ended by holding forth at\r\nlength on the Spanish marriages, which had just taken place, and the\r\nannoyances to which they subjected him on the side of England.\r\n\r\n\"The Queen is very angry with me,\" he said, \"and displays great\r\nirritation; but, after all,\" he added, \"all this outcry won't keep me\r\nfrom _driving my own cart_.\"[2]\r\n\r\n     [2: \"_Mener mon fiacre_\": to drive my hackney-coach.--A.T. de M.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this phrase dated back to the Old Order, I felt inclined to\r\ndoubt whether Louis XIV. ever made use of it on accepting the Spanish\r\nSuccession. I believe, moreover, that Louis-Philippe was mistaken, and,\r\nto borrow his own language, that the Spanish marriage helped not a\r\nlittle to upset his cart.\r\n\r\nAfter three-quarters of an hour, the King rose, thanked me for the\r\npleasure my conversation had given him (I had not spoken four words),\r\nand dismissed me, feeling evidently as delighted as one generally is\r\nwith a man before whom one thinks one has spoken well. This was my last\r\naudience of the King.\r\n\r\nLouis-Philippe improvised all the replies which he made, even upon the\r\nmost critical occasions, to the great State bodies; he was as fluent\r\nthen as in his private conversation, although not so happy or\r\nepigrammatic. He would suddenly become obscure, for the reason that he\r\nboldly plunged headlong into long sentences, of which he was not able to\r\nestimate the extent nor perceive the end beforehand, and from which he\r\nfinally emerged struggling and by force, shattering the sense, and not\r\ncompleting the thought.\r\n\r\nIn this political world thus constituted and conducted, what was most\r\nwanting, particularly towards the end, was political life itself. It\r\ncould neither come into being nor be maintained within the legal circle\r\nwhich the Constitution had traced for it: the old aristocracy was\r\nvanquished, the people excluded. As all business was discussed among\r\nmembers of one class, in the interest and in the spirit of that class,\r\nthere was no battle-field for contending parties to meet upon. This\r\nsingular homogeneity of position, of interests, and consequently of\r\nviews, reigning in what M. Guizot had once called the legal country,\r\ndeprived the parliamentary debates of all originality, of all reality,\r\nand therefore of all genuine passion. I have spent ten years of my life\r\nin the company of truly great minds, who were in a constant state of\r\nagitation without succeeding in heating themselves, and who spent all\r\ntheir perspicacity in vain endeavours to find subjects upon which they\r\ncould seriously disagree.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the preponderating influence which King\r\nLouis-Philippe had acquired in public affairs, which never permitted the\r\npoliticians to stray very far from that Prince's ideas, lest they should\r\nat the same time be removed from power, reduced the different colours of\r\nparties to the merest shades, and debates to the splitting of straws. I\r\ndoubt whether any parliament (not excepting the Constituent Assembly, I\r\nmean the true one, that of 1789) ever contained more varied and\r\nbrilliant talents than did ours during the closing years of the Monarchy\r\nof July. Nevertheless, I am able to declare that these great orators\r\nwere tired to death of listening to one another, and, what was worse,\r\nthe whole country was tired of listening to them. It grew unconsciously\r\naccustomed to look upon the debates in the Chambers as exercises of the\r\nintellect rather than as serious discussions, and upon all the\r\ndifferences between the various parliamentary parties--the majority, the\r\nleft centre, or the dynastic opposition--as domestic quarrels between\r\nchildren of one family trying to trick one another. A few glaring\r\ninstances of corruption, discovered by accident, led it to presuppose a\r\nnumber of hidden cases, and convinced it that the whole of the governing\r\nclass was corrupt; whence it conceived for the latter a silent contempt,\r\nwhich was generally taken for confiding and contented submission.\r\n\r\nThe country was at that time divided into two unequal parts, or rather\r\nzones: in the upper, which alone was intended to contain the whole of\r\nthe nation's political life, there reigned nothing but languor,\r\nimpotence, stagnation, and boredom; in the lower, on the contrary,\r\npolitical life began to make itself manifest by means of feverish and\r\nirregular signs, of which the attentive observer was easily able to\r\nseize the meaning.\r\n\r\nI was one of these observers; and although I was far from imagining that\r\nthe catastrophe was so near at hand and fated to be so terrible, I felt\r\na distrust springing up and insensibly growing in my mind, and the idea\r\ntaking root more and more that we were making strides towards a fresh\r\nrevolution. This denoted a great change in my thoughts; since the\r\ngeneral appeasement and flatness that followed the Revolution of July\r\nhad led me to believe for a long time that I was destined to spend my\r\nlife amid an enervated and peaceful society. Indeed, anyone who had only\r\nexamined the inside of the governmental fabric would have had the same\r\nconviction. Everything there seemed combined to produce with the\r\nmachinery of liberty a preponderance of royal power which verged upon\r\ndespotism; and, in fact, this result was produced almost without effort\r\nby the regular and tranquil movement of the machine. King Louis-Philippe\r\nwas persuaded that, so long as he did not himself lay hand upon that\r\nfine instrument, and allowed it to work according to rule, he was safe\r\nfrom all peril. His only occupation was to keep it in order, and to\r\nmake it work according to his own views, forgetful of society, upon\r\nwhich this ingenious piece of mechanism rested; he resembled the man who\r\nrefused to believe that his house was on fire, because he had the key in\r\nhis pocket. I had neither the same interests nor the same cares, and\r\nthis permitted me to see through the mechanism of institutions and the\r\nagglomeration of petty every-day facts, and to observe the state of\r\nmorals and opinions in the country. There I clearly beheld the\r\nappearance of several of the portents that usually denote the approach\r\nof revolutions, and I began to believe that in 1830 I had taken for the\r\nend of the play what was nothing more than the end of an act.\r\n\r\nA short unpublished document which I composed at the time, and a speech\r\nwhich I delivered early in 1848, will bear witness to these\r\npreoccupations of my mind.\r\n\r\nA number of my friends in Parliament met together in October 1847, to\r\ndecide upon the policy to be adopted during the ensuing session. It was\r\nagreed that we should issue a programme in the form of a manifesto, and\r\nthe task of drawing it up was deputed to me. Later, the idea of this\r\npublication was abandoned, but I had already written the document. I\r\nhave discovered it among my papers, and I give the following extracts.\r\nAfter commenting on the symptoms of languor in Parliament, I continued:\r\n\r\n     \"... The time will come when the country will find itself once\r\n     again divided between two great parties. The French Revolution,\r\n     which abolished all privileges and destroyed all exclusive rights,\r\n     has allowed one to remain, that of landed property. Let not the\r\n     landlords deceive themselves as to the strength of their position,\r\n     nor think that the rights of property form an insurmountable\r\n     barrier because they have not as yet been surmounted; for our times\r\n     are unlike any others. When the rights of property were merely the\r\n     origin and commencement of a number of other rights, they were\r\n     easily defended, or rather, they were never attacked; they then\r\n     formed the surrounding wall of society, of which all other rights\r\n     were the outposts; no blows reached them; no serious attempt was\r\n     ever made to touch them. But to-day, when the rights of property\r\n     are nothing more than the last remnants of an overthrown\r\n     aristocratic world; when they alone are left intact, isolated\r\n     privileges amid the universal levelling of society; when they are\r\n     no longer protected behind a number of still more controversible\r\n     and odious rights, the case is altered, and they alone are left\r\n     daily to resist the direct and unceasing shock of democratic\r\n     opinion....\r\n\r\n     \"... Before long, the political struggle will be restricted to\r\n     those who have and those who have not; property will form the great\r\n     field of battle; and the principal political questions will turn\r\n     upon the more or less important modifications to be introduced into\r\n     the rights of landlords. We shall then have once more among us\r\n     great public agitations and great political parties.\r\n\r\n     \"How is it that these premonitory symptoms escape the general view?\r\n     Can anyone believe that it is by accident, through some passing\r\n     whim of the human brain, that we see appearing on every side these\r\n     curious doctrines, bearing different titles, but all characterized\r\n     in their essence by their denial of the rights of property, and all\r\n     tending, at least, to limit, diminish, and weaken the exercise of\r\n     these rights? Who can fail here to recognise the final symptom of\r\n     the old democratic disease of the time, whose crisis would seem to\r\n     be at hand?\"\r\n\r\nI was still more urgent and explicit in the speech which I delivered in\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies on the 29th of January 1848, and which appeared\r\nin the _Moniteur_ of the 30th.\r\n\r\nI quote the principal passages:\r\n\r\n     \"... I am told that there is no danger because there are no riots;\r\n     I am told that, because there is no visible disorder on the surface\r\n     of society, there is no revolution at hand.\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, permit me to say that I believe you are deceived. True,\r\n     there is no actual disorder; but it has entered deeply into men's\r\n     minds. See what is passing in the breasts of the working classes,\r\n     who, I grant, are at present quiet. No doubt they are not disturbed\r\n     by political passion, properly so-called, to the same extent that\r\n     they have been; but can you not see that their passions, instead of\r\n     political, have become social? Do you not see that there are\r\n     gradually forming in their breasts opinions and ideas which are\r\n     destined not only to upset this or that law, ministry, or even form\r\n     of government, but society itself, until it totters upon the\r\n     foundations on which it rests to-day? Do you not listen to what\r\n     they say to themselves each day? Do you not hear them repeating\r\n     unceasingly that all that is above them is incapable and unworthy\r\n     of governing them; that the present distribution of goods\r\n     throughout the world is unjust; that property rests on a foundation\r\n     which is not an equitable foundation? And do you not realize that\r\n     when such opinions take root, when they spread in an almost\r\n     universal manner, when they sink deeply into the masses, they are\r\n     bound to bring with them sooner or later, I know not when nor how,\r\n     a most formidable revolution?\r\n\r\n     \"This, gentlemen, is my profound conviction: I believe that we are\r\n     at this moment sleeping on a volcano. I am profoundly convinced of\r\n     it....\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     \"... I was saying just now that this evil would, sooner or later, I\r\n     know not how nor whence it will come, bring with it a most serious\r\n     revolution: be assured that that is so.\r\n\r\n     \"When I come to investigate what, at different times, in different\r\n     periods, among different peoples, has been the effective cause that\r\n     has brought about the downfall of the governing classes, I perceive\r\n     this or that event, man, or accidental or superficial cause; but,\r\n     believe me, the real reason, the effective reason which causes men\r\n     to lose their power is, that they have become unworthy to retain\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     \"Think, gentlemen, of the old Monarchy: it was stronger than you\r\n     are, stronger in its origin; it was able to lean more than you do\r\n     upon ancient customs, ancient habits, ancient beliefs; it was\r\n     stronger than you are, and yet it has fallen to dust. And why did\r\n     it fall? Do you think it was by some particular mischance? Do you\r\n     think it was by the act of some man, by the deficit, the oath in\r\n     the Tennis Court, La Fayette, Mirabeau? No, gentlemen; there was\r\n     another reason: the class that was then the governing class had\r\n     become, through its indifference, its selfishness and its vices,\r\n     incapable and unworthy of governing the country.\r\n\r\n     \"That was the true reason.\r\n\r\n     \"Well, gentlemen, if it is right to have this patriotic prejudice\r\n     at all times, how much more is it not right to have it in our own?\r\n     Do you not feel, by some intuitive instinct which is not capable of\r\n     analysis, but which is undeniable, that the earth is quaking once\r\n     again in Europe? Do you not feel ... what shall I say? ... as it\r\n     were a gale of revolution in the air? This gale, no one knows\r\n     whence it springs, whence it blows, nor, believe me, whom it will\r\n     carry with it; and it is in such times as these that you remain\r\n     calm before the degradation of public morality--for the expression\r\n     is not too strong.\r\n\r\n     \"I speak without bitterness; I am even addressing you without any\r\n     party spirit; I am attacking men against whom I feel no\r\n     vindictiveness. But I am obliged to communicate to my country my\r\n     firm and decided conviction. Well then, my firm and decided\r\n     conviction is this: that public morality is being degraded, and\r\n     that the degradation of public morality will shortly, very shortly,\r\n     perhaps, bring down upon you a new revolution. Is the life of kings\r\n     held by stronger threads? Are these more difficult to snap than\r\n     those of other men? Can you say to-day that you are certain of\r\n     to-morrow? Do you know what may happen in France a year hence, or\r\n     even a month or a day hence? You do not know; but what you must\r\n     know is that the tempest is looming on the horizon, that it is\r\n     coming towards us. Will you allow it to take you by surprise?\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, I implore you not to do so. I do not ask you, I implore\r\n     you. I would gladly throw myself on my knees before you, so\r\n     strongly do I believe in the reality and the seriousness of the\r\n     danger, so convinced am I that my warnings are no empty rhetoric.\r\n     Yes, the danger is great. Allay it while there is yet time; correct\r\n     the evil by efficacious remedies, by attacking it not in its\r\n     symptoms but in itself.\r\n\r\n     \"Legislative changes have been spoken of. I am greatly disposed to\r\n     think that these changes are not only very useful, but necessary;\r\n     thus, I believe in the need of electoral reform, in the urgency of\r\n     parliamentary reform; but I am not, gentlemen, so mad as not to\r\n     know that no laws can affect the destinies of nations. No, it is\r\n     not the mechanism of laws that produces great events, gentlemen,\r\n     but the inner spirit of the government. Keep the laws as they are,\r\n     if you wish. I think you would be very wrong to do so; but keep\r\n     them. Keep the men, too, if it gives you any pleasure. I raise no\r\n     objection so far as I am concerned. But, in God's name, change the\r\n     spirit of the government; for, I repeat, that spirit will lead you\r\n     to the abyss.\"[3]\r\n\r\n     [3: This speech was delivered in the Chamber of Deputies on the\r\n     27th of January 1848, in the debate on the Address in reply to the\r\n     Speech from the Throne.--Cte. de T.]\r\n\r\nThese gloomy predictions were received with ironical cheers from the\r\nmajority. The Opposition applauded loudly, but more from party feeling\r\nthan conviction. The truth is that no one as yet believed seriously in\r\nthe danger which I was prophesying, although we were so near the\r\ncatastrophe. The inveterate habit contracted by all the politicians,\r\nduring this long parliamentary farce, of over-colouring the expression\r\nof their opinions and grossly exaggerating their thoughts had deprived\r\nthem of all power of appreciating what was real and true. For several\r\nyears the majority had every day been declaring that the Opposition was\r\nimperilling society; and the Opposition repeated incessantly that the\r\nMinisters were ruining the Monarchy. These statements had been made so\r\nconstantly on both sides, without either side greatly believing in them,\r\nthat they ended by not believing in them at all, at the very moment when\r\nthe event was about to justify both of them. Even my own friends\r\nthemselves thought that I had overshot the mark, and that my facts were\r\na little blurred by rhetoric.\r\n\r\nI remember that, when I stepped from the tribune, Dufaure took me on one\r\nside, and said, with that sort of parliamentary intuition which is his\r\nonly note of genius:\r\n\r\n\"You have succeeded, but you would have succeeded much more if you had\r\nnot gone so far beyond the feeling of the Assembly and tried to frighten\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now that I am face to face with myself, searching in my memory to\r\ndiscover whether I was actually myself so much alarmed as I seemed, the\r\nanswer is no, and I readily recognise that the event justified me more\r\npromptly and more completely than I foresaw (a thing which may sometimes\r\nhave happened to other political prophets, better authorized to predict\r\nthan I was). No, I did not expect such a revolution as we were destined\r\nto have; and who could have expected it? I did, I believe, perceive more\r\nclearly than the others the general causes which were making for the\r\nevent; but I did not observe the accidents which were to precipitate it.\r\nMeantime the days which still separated us from the catastrophe passed\r\nrapidly by.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     THE BANQUETS--SENSE OF SECURITY ENTERTAINED BY THE\r\n     GOVERNMENT--ANXIETY OF LEADERS OF THE OPPOSITION--ARRAIGNMENT OF\r\n     MINISTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI refused to take part in the affair of the banquets. I had both serious\r\nand petty reasons for abstaining. What I call my petty reasons I am\r\nquite willing to describe as bad reasons, although they were consistent\r\nwith honour, and would have been unexceptionable in a private matter.\r\nThey were the irritation and disgust aroused in me by the character and\r\nby the tactics of the leaders of this enterprise. Nevertheless, I\r\nconfess that the private prejudice which we entertain with regard to\r\nindividuals is a bad guide in politics.\r\n\r\nA close alliance had at that time been effected between M. Thiers and M.\r\nBarrot, and a real fusion formed between the two sections of the\r\nOpposition, which, in our parliamentary jargon, we called the Left\r\nCentre and the Left. Almost all the stubborn and intractable spirits\r\nwhich were found in the latter party had successively been softened,\r\nunbent, subjugated, made supple, by the promises of place spread\r\nbroadcast by M. Thiers. I believe that even M. Barrot had for the first\r\ntime allowed himself not exactly to be won over, but surprised, by\r\narguments of this kind. At any rate, the most complete intimacy reigned\r\nbetween the two great leaders of the Opposition, whatever was the cause\r\nof it, and M. Barrot, who likes to mingle a little simplicity with his\r\nweaknesses as well as with his virtues, exerted himself to his utmost to\r\nsecure the triumph of his ally, even at his own expense. M. Thiers had\r\nallowed him to involve himself in this matter of the banquets; I even\r\nthink that he had instigated Barrot in that direction without consenting\r\nto involve himself. He was willing to accept the results, but not the\r\nresponsibilities, of that dangerous agitation. Wherefore, surrounded by\r\nhis personal friends, he stayed mute and motionless in Paris, while\r\nBarrot travelled all over the country for three months, making long\r\nspeeches in every town he stopped at, and resembling, in my opinion,\r\nthose beaters who make a great noise in order to bring the game within\r\neasy range of the sportsman's gun. Personally, I felt no inclination to\r\ntake part in the sport. But the principal and more serious reason which\r\nrestrained me was this: and I expounded it pretty often to those who\r\nwanted to drag me to those political meetings:\r\n\r\n\"For the first time for eighteen years,\" I used to tell them, \"you are\r\nproposing to appeal to the people, and to seek support outside the\r\nmiddle class. If you fail in rousing the people (and I think this will\r\nbe the most probable result), you will become still more odious than you\r\nalready are in the eyes of the Government and of the middle classes,\r\nwho for a great part support it. In this way you will strengthen the\r\nadministration which you desire to upset; while if, on the contrary, you\r\nsucceed in rousing the people, you are no more able than I am to foresee\r\nwhither an agitation of this kind will lead you.\"\r\n\r\nIn the measure that the campaign of the banquets was prolonged, the\r\nlatter hypothesis became, contrary to my expectation, the more probable.\r\nA certain anxiety began to oppress the ringleaders themselves; an\r\nindefinite anxiety, passing vaguely through their minds. I was told by\r\nBeaumont, who was at that time one of the first among them, that the\r\nexcitement occasioned in the country by the banquets surpassed not only\r\nthe hopes, but the wishes, of those who had started it. The latter were\r\nlabouring to allay rather than increase it. Their intention was that\r\nthere should be no banquet in Paris, and that there should be none held\r\nanywhere after the assembling of the Chambers. The fact is that they\r\nwere only seeking a way out of the mischievous road which they had\r\nentered upon. And it was undoubtedly in spite of them that this final\r\nbanquet was resolved on; they were constrained to take part in it, drawn\r\ninto it; their vanity was compromised. The Government, by its defiance,\r\ngoaded the Opposition into adopting this dangerous measure, thinking\r\nthus to drive it to destruction. The Opposition let itself be caught in\r\na spirit of bravado, and lest it should be suspected of retreating; and\r\nthus irritating each other, spurring one another on, they dragged each\r\nother towards the common abyss, which neither of them as yet perceived.\r\n\r\nI remember that two days before the Revolution of February, at the\r\nTurkish Ambassador's ball, I met Duvergier de Hauranne. I felt for him\r\nboth friendship and esteem; although he possessed very nearly all the\r\nfailings that arise from party spirit, he at least joined to them the\r\nsort of disinterestedness and sincerity which one meets with in genuine\r\npassions, two rare advantages in our day, when the only genuine passion\r\nis that of self. I said to him, with the familiarity warranted by our\r\nrelations:\r\n\r\n\"Courage, my friend; you are playing a dangerous game.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied gravely, but with no sign of fear:\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, all will end well; besides, one must risk something. There\r\nis no free government that has not had to go through a similar\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\nThis reply perfectly describes this determined but somewhat narrow\r\ncharacter; narrow, I say, although with plenty of brain, but with the\r\nbrain which, while seeing clearly and in detail all that is on the\r\nhorizon, is incapable of conceiving that the horizon may change;\r\nscholarly, disinterested, ardent, vindictive, sprung from that learned\r\nand sectarian race which guides itself in politics by imitation of\r\nothers and by historical recollection, and which restricts its thought\r\nto one sole idea, at which it warms, in which it blinds itself.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the Government were even less uneasy than the leaders of\r\nthe Opposition. A few days before the above conversation, I had had\r\nanother with Duchatel, the Minister of the Interior. I was on good terms\r\nwith this minister, although for the last eight years I had been very\r\nboldly (even too boldly, I confess, in the case of its foreign policy)\r\nattacking the Cabinet of which he was one of the principal members. I am\r\nnot sure that this fault did not even make me find favour in his eyes,\r\nfor I believe that at the bottom of his heart he had a sneaking fondness\r\nfor those who attacked his colleague at the Foreign Office, M. Guizot. A\r\nbattle which M. Duchatel and I had fought some years before in favour of\r\nthe penitentiary system had brought us together and given rise to a\r\ncertain intimacy between us. This man was very unlike the one I\r\nmentioned above: he was as heavy in his person and his manners as the\r\nother was meagre, angular, and sometimes trenchant and bitter. He was as\r\nremarkable for his scepticism as the other for his ardent convictions,\r\nfor flabby indifference as the former for feverish activity; he\r\npossessed a very supple, very quick, very subtle mind enclosed in a\r\nmassive body; he understood business admirably, while pretending to be\r\nabove it; he was thoroughly acquainted with the evil passions of\r\nmankind, and especially with the evil passions of his party, and always\r\nknew how to turn them to advantage. He was free from all rancour and\r\nprejudice, cordial in his address, easy of approach, obliging, whenever\r\nhis own interests were not compromised, and bore a kindly contempt for\r\nhis fellow-creatures.\r\n\r\nI was about to say that, some days before the catastrophe, I drew M.\r\nDuchatel into a corner of the conference room, and observed to him that\r\nthe Government and the Opposition seemed to be striving in concert to\r\ndrive things to an extremity calculated to end by damaging everybody;\r\nand I asked him if he saw no honest way of escape from a regrettable\r\nposition, some honourable transaction which would permit everyone to\r\ndraw back. I added that my friends and I would be happy to have such a\r\nway pointed out to us, and that we would make every exertion to persuade\r\nour colleagues in the Opposition to accept it. He listened attentively\r\nto my remarks, and assured me that he understood my meaning, although I\r\nsaw clearly that he did not enter into it for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"Things had reached such a pitch,\" he said, \"that the expedient which I\r\nsought was no longer to be found. The Government was in the right, and\r\ncould not yield. If the Opposition persisted in its course, the result\r\nmight be a combat in the streets, but this combat had long been\r\nforeseen, and if the Government was animated with the evil passions with\r\nwhich it was credited, it would desire this fighting rather than dread\r\nit, being sure to triumph in the end.\"\r\n\r\nHe went on in his complaisant fashion to tell me in detail of all the\r\nmilitary precautions that had been taken, the extent of the resources,\r\nthe number of the troops, and the quantity of ammunition.... I took my\r\nleave, satisfied that the Government, without exactly striving to\r\npromote an outbreak, was far from dreading one, and that the Ministry,\r\nin its certainty of ultimate victory, saw in the threatening catastrophe\r\npossibly its last means of rallying its scattered supporters and of\r\nfinally reducing its adversaries to powerlessness. I confess that I\r\nthought as he did; his air of unfeigned assurance had proved contagious.\r\n\r\nThe only really uneasy people in Paris at that moment were the Radical\r\nchiefs and the men who were sufficiently in touch with the people and\r\nthe revolutionary party to know what was taking place in that quarter. I\r\nhave reason to believe that most of these looked with dread upon the\r\nevents which were ready to burst forth, whether because they kept up the\r\ntradition of their former passions rather than these passions\r\nthemselves, or because they had begun to grow accustomed to a state of\r\nthings in which they had taken up their position after so many times\r\ncursing it; or again, because they were doubtful of success; or rather\r\nbecause, being in a position to study and become well acquainted with\r\ntheir allies, they were frightened at the last moment of the victory\r\nwhich they expected to gain through their aid. On the very day before\r\nthe outbreak, Madame de Lamartine betrayed extraordinary anxiety when\r\ncalling upon Madame de Tocqueville, and gave such unmistakable signs of\r\na mind heated and almost deranged by ominous thoughts that the latter\r\nbecame alarmed, and told me of it the same evening.\r\n\r\nIt is not one of the least curious characteristics of this singular\r\nrevolution that the incident which led to it was brought about and\r\nalmost longed for by the men whom it eventually precipitated from power,\r\nand that it was only foreseen and feared by those who were to triumph by\r\nits means.\r\n\r\nHere let me for a moment resume the chain of history, so that I may the\r\nmore easily attach to it the thread of my personal recollections.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, at the opening of the session of 1848, King\r\nLouis-Philippe, in his Speech from the Throne, had described the authors\r\nof the banquets as men excited by blind or hostile passions. This was\r\nbringing Royalty into direct conflict with more than one hundred members\r\nof the Chamber. This insult, which added anger to all the ambitious\r\npassions which were already disturbing the hearts of the majority of\r\nthese men, ended by making them lose their reason. A violent debate was\r\nexpected, but did not take place at once. The earlier discussions on the\r\nAddress were calm: the majority and the Opposition both restrained\r\nthemselves at the commencement, like two men who feel that they have\r\nlost their tempers, and who fear lest while in that condition they\r\nshould perpetrate some folly in word or deed.\r\n\r\nBut the storm of passion broke out at last, and continued with\r\nunaccustomed violence. The extraordinary heat of these debates was\r\nalready redolent of civil war for those who knew how to scent\r\nrevolutions from afar.\r\n\r\nThe spokesmen of the moderate section of the Opposition were led, in the\r\nheat of debate, to assert that the right of assembling at the banquets\r\nwas one of our most undeniable and essential rights;[4] that to question\r\nit, was equivalent to trampling liberty itself underfoot and to\r\nviolating the Charter, and that those who did so unconsciously made an\r\nappeal, not to discussion, but to arms. On his side M. Duchatel, who\r\nordinarily was very dexterous in debate, displayed in this circumstance\r\na consummate want of tact.[5] He absolutely denied the right of\r\nassemblage, and yet would not say clearly that the Government had made\r\nup its mind to prohibit thenceforth any manifestations of the kind. On\r\nthe contrary, he seemed to invite the Opposition to try the experiment\r\nonce more, so that the question might be brought before the Courts. His\r\ncolleague, M. Hebert, the Minister of Justice, was still more tactless,\r\nbut this was his habit. I have always observed that lawyers never make\r\nstatesmen; but I have never met anyone who was less of a statesman than\r\nM. Hebert. He remained the Public-Prosecutor down to the marrow of his\r\nbones; he had all the mental and physical characteristics of that\r\noffice. You must imagine a little wizened, sorry face, shrunk at the\r\ntemples, with a pointed forehead, nose and chin, cold, bright eyes, and\r\nthin, in-drawn lips. Add to this a long quill generally held across the\r\nmouth, and looking at a distance like a cat's bristling whiskers, and\r\nyou have a portrait of a man, than whom I have never seen anyone more\r\nresembling a carnivorous animal. At the same time, he was neither stupid\r\nnor even ill-natured; but he was by nature hot-headed and unyielding; he\r\nalways overshot his goal, for want of knowing when to turn aside or stop\r\nstill; and he fell into violence without intending it, and from sheer\r\nwant of discrimination. It showed how little importance M. Guizot\r\nattached to conciliation, that under the circumstances he sent a speaker\r\nof this stamp into the tribune;[6] his language while there was so\r\noutrageous and so provoking that Barrot, quite beside himself and almost\r\nwithout knowing what he was doing, exclaimed, in a voice half stifled\r\nwith rage, that the ministers of Charles X., that Polignac and\r\nPeyronnet, had never dared to talk like that. I remember that I\r\nshuddered involuntarily in my seat when I heard this naturally moderate\r\nman exasperated into recalling, for the first time, the terrible\r\nmemories of the Revolution of 1830, holding it up in some sort as an\r\nexample, and unconsciously suggesting the idea of repeating it.\r\n\r\n     [4: See the speech of M. Duvergier de Hauranne, 7 February\r\n     1848.--Cte. de T.]\r\n\r\n     [5: The minister replied to M. Leon de Mandeville. He quoted the\r\n     laws of 1790 and 1791, which empowered the authorities to oppose\r\n     any public meetings which seemed to threaten danger to the public\r\n     peace, and he declared that the Government would be failing in its\r\n     duty if it were to give way before manifestations of any\r\n     description. At the end of his speech he again brought in the\r\n     phrase \"blind or hostile passions,\" and endeavoured to justify\r\n     it.--Cte. de T.]\r\n\r\n     [6: Replying to M. Odilon Barrot, M. Hebert maintained that, since\r\n     the right of public meeting was not laid down in the Charter, it\r\n     did not exist.--Cte. de T.]\r\n\r\nThe result of this heated discussion was a sort of challenge to mortal\r\ncombat exchanged between the Government and the Opposition, the scene of\r\nthe duel to be the law-courts. It was tacitly agreed that the challenged\r\nparty should meet at one final banquet; that the authorities, without\r\ninterfering to prevent the meeting, should prosecute its organizers, and\r\nthat the courts should pronounce judgment.\r\n\r\nThe debates on the Address were closed, if I remember rightly, on the\r\n12th of February, and it is really from this moment that the\r\nrevolutionary movement burst out. The Constitutional Opposition, which\r\nhad for many months been constantly pushed on by the Radical party, was\r\nfrom this time forward led and directed not so much by the members of\r\nthat party who occupied seats in the Chamber of Deputies (the greater\r\nnumber of these had become lukewarm and, as it were, enervated in the\r\nParliamentary atmosphere), as by the younger, bolder, and more\r\nirresponsible men who wrote for the democratic press. This change was\r\nespecially apparent in two principal facts which had an overwhelming\r\ninfluence upon events--the programme of the banquet and the arraignment\r\nof Ministers.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of February, there appeared in almost all the Opposition\r\nnewspapers, by way of programme of the approaching banquet, what was\r\nreally a proclamation calling upon the entire population to join in an\r\nimmense political demonstration, convoking the schools and inviting the\r\nNational Guard itself to attend the ceremony in a body. It read like a\r\ndecree emanating from the Provisional Government which was to be set up\r\nthree days later. The Cabinet, which had already been blamed by many of\r\nits followers for tacitly authorising the banquet, considered that it\r\nwas justified in retracing its steps. It officially announced that it\r\nforbade the banquet, and that it would prevent it by force.\r\n\r\nIt was this declaration of the Government which provided the field for\r\nthe battle. I am in a position to state, although it sounds hardly\r\ncredible, that the programme which thus suddenly turned the banquet into\r\nan insurrection was resolved upon, drawn up and published without the\r\nparticipation or the knowledge of the members of Parliament who\r\nconsidered themselves to be still leading the movement which they had\r\ncalled into existence. The programme was the hurried work of a nocturnal\r\ngathering of journalists and Radicals, and the leaders of the Dynastic\r\nOpposition heard of it at the same time as the public, by reading it in\r\nthe papers in the morning.\r\n\r\nAnd see how uncertain is the course of human affairs! M. Odilon Barrot,\r\nwho disapproved of the programme as much as anyone, dared not disclaim\r\nit for fear of offending the men who, till then, had seemed to be moving\r\nwith him; and then, when the Government, alarmed by the publication of\r\nthis document, prohibited the banquet, M. Barrot, finding himself\r\nbrought face to face with civil war, drew back. He himself gave up this\r\ndangerous demonstration; but at the same time that he was making this\r\nconcession to the men of moderation, he granted to the extremists the\r\nimpeachment of Ministers. He accused the latter of violating the\r\nConstitution by prohibiting the banquet, and thus furnished an excuse to\r\nthose who were about to take up arms in the name of the violated\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nThus the principal leaders of the Radical Party, who thought that a\r\nrevolution would be premature, and who did not yet desire it, had\r\nconsidered themselves obliged, in order to differentiate themselves from\r\ntheir allies in the Dynastic Opposition, to make very revolutionary\r\nspeeches and fan the flame of insurrectionary passion. On the other\r\nhand, the Dynastic Opposition, which had had enough of the banquets, had\r\nbeen forced to persevere in this bad course so as not to present an\r\nappearance of retreating before the defiance of the Government. And\r\nfinally, the mass of the Conservatives, who believed in the necessity of\r\ngreat concessions and were ready to make them, were driven by the\r\nviolence of their adversaries and the passions of some of their chiefs\r\nto deny even the right of meeting in private banquets and to refuse the\r\ncountry any hopes of reform.\r\n\r\nOne must have lived long amid political parties, and in the very\r\nwhirlwind in which they move, to understand to what extent men mutually\r\npush each other away from their respective plans, and how the destinies\r\nof this world proceed as the result, but often as the contrary result,\r\nof the intentions that produce them, similarly to the kite which flies\r\nby the antagonistic action of the wind and the cord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     TROUBLES OF THE 22ND OF FEBRUARY--THE SITTING OF THE 23RD--THE NEW\r\n     MINISTRY--OPINIONS OF M. DUFAURE AND M. DE BEAUMONT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not perceive anything on the 22nd of February calculated to give\r\nrise to serious apprehensions. There was a crowd in the streets, but it\r\nseemed to be composed rather of sight-seers and fault-finders than of\r\nthe seditiously inclined: the soldier and the townsman chaffed each\r\nother when they met, and I heard more jokes than cries uttered by the\r\ncrowd. I know that it is not safe to trust one's self to these\r\nappearances. It is the street-boys of Paris who generally commence the\r\ninsurrections, and as a rule they do so light-heartedly, like schoolboys\r\nbreaking up for the holidays.\r\n\r\nWhen I returned to the Chamber, I found a seeming listlessness reigning\r\nthere, beneath which one could perceive the inner seething of a thousand\r\nrestrained passions. It was the only place in Paris in which, since the\r\nearly morning, I had not heard discussed aloud what was then absorbing\r\nall France. They were languidly discussing a bill for the creation of a\r\nbank at Bordeaux; but in reality no one, except the man talking in the\r\ntribune and the man who was to reply to him, showed any interest in the\r\nmatter. M. Duchatel told me that all was going well. He said this with\r\nan air of combined confidence and nervousness which struck me as\r\nsuspicious. I noticed that he twisted his neck and shoulders (a common\r\ntrick with him) much more frequently and violently than usual; and I\r\nremember that this little observation gave me more food for reflection\r\nthan all the rest.\r\n\r\nI learnt that, as a matter of fact, there had been serious troubles in\r\nmany parts of the town which I had not visited; a certain number of men\r\nhad been killed or wounded. People were no longer accustomed to this\r\nsort of incident, as they had been some years before and as they became\r\nstill more a few months later; and the excitement was great. I happened\r\nto be invited to dine that evening at the house of one of my\r\nfellow-members of Parliament and of the Opposition, M. Paulmier, the\r\ndeputy for Calvados. I had some difficulty in getting there through the\r\ntroops which guarded the surrounding streets. I found my host's house in\r\ngreat disorder. Madame Paulmier, who was expecting her _accouchement_\r\nand who had been frightened by a skirmish that had taken place beneath\r\nher windows, had gone to bed. The dinner was magnificent, but the table\r\nwas deserted; out of twenty guests invited, only five presented\r\nthemselves; the others were kept back either by material impediments or\r\nby the preoccupations of the day. We sat down with a very thoughtful air\r\namid all this abundance. Among the guests was M. Sallandrouze, the\r\ninheritor of the great business house of that name, which had made a\r\nlarge fortune by its manufacture of textile fabrics. He was one of those\r\nyoung Conservatives, richer in money than in honours, who, from time to\r\ntime, made a show of opposition, or rather, of captious criticism,\r\nmainly, I think, to give themselves a certain importance. In the course\r\nof the last debate on the Address, M. Sallandrouze had moved an\r\namendment[7] which would have compromised the Cabinet, had it been\r\nadopted. At the time when this incident was most occupying attention, M.\r\nSallandrouze one evening went to the reception at the Tuileries, hoping\r\nthat this time, at least, he would not remain unrecognized in the crowd.\r\nAnd, in fact, no sooner had King Louis-Philippe seen him than he came up\r\nto him with a very assiduous mien, and solemnly took him aside and began\r\nto talk to him eagerly, and with a great display of interest, about the\r\nbranch of manufacture to which the young deputy owed his fortune. The\r\nlatter, at first, felt no astonishment, thinking that the King, who was\r\nknown to be clever at managing men's minds, had selected this little\r\nprivate road in order to lead round to affairs of State. But he was\r\nmistaken; for, after a quarter of an hour, the King changed not the\r\nconversation but the person addressed, and left our friend standing very\r\nconfused amid his carpets and woollen stuffs. M. Sallandrouze had not\r\nyet got over this trick played upon him, but he was beginning to feel\r\nvery much afraid that he would be revenged too well. He told us that M.\r\nEmile Girardin had said to him the day before, \"In two days, the\r\nMonarchy of July will have ceased to exist.\" This seemed to all of us a\r\npiece of journalistic hyperbole, and perhaps it was; but the events that\r\nfollowed turned it into an oracle.\r\n\r\n     [7: M. Sallandrouze de Lamornaix' amendment proposed to modify the\r\n     expression \"blind or hostile passions,\" by adding the words: \"Amid\r\n     these various demonstrations, your Government will know how to\r\n     recognise the real and lawful desires of the country; it will, we\r\n     trust, take the initiative by introducing certain wise and moderate\r\n     reforms called for by public opinion, among which we must place\r\n     first parliamentary reform. In a Constitutional Monarchy, the union\r\n     of the great powers of the State removes all danger from a\r\n     progressive policy, and allows every moral and material interest of\r\n     the country to be satisfied.\"--Cte. de T.]\r\n\r\nOn the next day, the 23rd of February, I learnt, on waking, that the\r\nexcitement in Paris, so far from becoming calmer, was increasing. I went\r\nearly to the Chamber; silence reigned around the Assembly; battalions of\r\ninfantry occupied and closed the approaches, while troops of Cuirassiers\r\nwere drawn up along the walls of the Palace. Inside, men's feelings were\r\nexcited without their quite knowing the reason.\r\n\r\nThe sitting had been opened at the ordinary time; but the Assembly had\r\nnot had the courage to go through the same parliamentary comedy as on\r\nthe day before, and had suspended its labours; it sat receiving reports\r\nfrom the different quarters of the town, awaiting events and counting\r\nthe hours, in a state of feverish idleness. At a certain moment, a loud\r\nsound of trumpets was heard outside. It appeared that the Cuirassiers\r\nguarding the Palace were amusing themselves, in order to pass the time,\r\nby sounding flourishes on their instruments. The gay, triumphant tones\r\nof the trumpets contrasted in so melancholy a fashion with the thoughts\r\nby which all our minds were secretly disturbed, that a message was\r\nhurriedly sent out to stop this offensive and indiscreet performance,\r\nwhich caused such painful reflections to all of us.\r\n\r\nAt last, it was determined to speak aloud of what all had been\r\ndiscussing in whispers for several hours. A Paris deputy, M. Vavin,\r\ncommenced to question the Cabinet upon the state of the city. At three\r\no'clock M. Guizot appeared at the door of the House. He entered with his\r\nfirmest step and his loftiest mien, silently crossed the gangway,\r\nascended the tribune, throwing his head almost back from his shoulders\r\nfor fear of seeming to lower it, and stated in two words that the King\r\nhad called upon M. Mole to form a new ministry. Never did I see such a\r\npiece of clap-trap.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition kept their seats, most of them uttering cries of victory\r\nand satisfied revenge; the leaders alone sat silent, busy in communing\r\nwith themselves upon the use they would make of their triumph, and\r\ncareful not to insult a majority of which they might soon be called upon\r\nto make use. As to the majority, they seemed thunderstruck by this so\r\nunexpected blow, moved to and fro like a mass that sways from side to\r\nside, uncertain as to which side it shall fall on, and then descended\r\nnoisily into the semi-circle. A few surrounded the ministers to ask\r\nthem for explanations or to pay them their last respects, but the\r\ngreater number clamoured against them with noisy and insulting shouts.\r\n\"To throw up office, to abandon your political friends under such\r\ncircumstances,\" they said, \"is a piece of gross cowardice;\" while others\r\nexclaimed that the members ought to repair to the Tuileries in a body,\r\nand force the King to re-consider his fatal resolve.\r\n\r\nThis despair will arouse no astonishment when it is remembered that the\r\ngreater number of these men felt themselves attacked, not only in their\r\npolitical opinions, but in the most sensitive part of their private\r\ninterest. The fall of the Government compromised the entire fortune of\r\none, the daughter's dowry of another, the son's career of a third. It\r\nwas by this that they were almost all held. Most of them had not only\r\nbettered themselves by means of their votes, but one may say that they\r\nhad lived on them. They still lived on them, and hoped to continue to\r\nlive on them; for, the Ministry having lasted eight years, they had\r\naccustomed themselves to think that it would last for ever; they had\r\ngrown attached to it with the honest, peaceful feeling of affection\r\nwhich one entertains for one's fields. From my seat, I watched this\r\nswaying crowd; I saw surprise, anger, fear and avarice mingle their\r\nvarious expressions upon those bewildered countenances; and I drew an\r\ninvoluntary comparison between all these legislators and a pack of\r\nhounds which, with their jaws half filled, see the quarry withdrawn\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nI grant, however, that, so far as many of the Opposition were concerned,\r\nit only wanted that they should be put to a similar test in order to\r\nmake the same display. If many of the Conservatives only defended the\r\nMinistry with a view to keeping their places and emoluments, I am bound\r\nto say that many of the Opposition seemed to me only to attack it in\r\norder to reap the plunder in their turn. The truth--the deplorable\r\ntruth--is that a taste for holding office and a desire to live on the\r\npublic money are not with us a disease restricted to either party, but\r\nthe great, chronic ailment of the whole nation; the result of the\r\ndemocratic constitution of our society and of the excessive\r\ncentralization of our Government; the secret malady which has undermined\r\nall former powers, and which will undermine all powers to come.\r\n\r\nAt last the uproar ceased, as the nature of what had happened became\r\nbetter known: we learnt that it had been brought about by the\r\ninsurrectionary inclinations of a battalion of the Fifth Legion and the\r\napplications made direct to the King by several officers of that section\r\nof the Guard.\r\n\r\nSo soon as he was informed of what was going on, King Louis-Philippe,\r\nwho was less prone to change his opinions, but more ready to change his\r\nline of conduct, than any man I ever saw, had immediately made up his\r\nmind; and after eight years of complacency, the Ministry was dismissed\r\nby him in two minutes, and without ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe Chamber rose without delay, each member thinking only of the change\r\nof government, and forgetting about the revolution.\r\n\r\nI went out with M. Dufaure, and soon perceived that he was not only\r\npreoccupied but constrained. I at once saw that he felt himself in the\r\ncritical and complicated position of a leader of the Opposition, who was\r\nabout to become a minister, and who, after experiencing the use his\r\nfriends could be to him, was beginning to think of the difficulties\r\nwhich their pretentions might well cause him.\r\n\r\nM. Dufaure had a somewhat cunning mind, which readily admitted such\r\nthoughts as these, and he also possessed a sort of natural rusticity\r\nwhich, combined with great integrity, but rarely permitted him to\r\nconceal them. He was, moreover, the sincerest and by far the most\r\nrespectable of all those who at that moment had a chance of becoming\r\nministers. He believed that power was at last within his grasp, and his\r\nambition betrayed a passion that was the more eager inasmuch as it was\r\ndiscreet and suppressed. M. Mole in his place would have felt much\r\ngreater egoism and still more ingratitude, but he would have been only\r\nall the more open-hearted and amiable.\r\n\r\nI soon left him, and went to M. de Beaumont's. There I found every heart\r\nrejoicing. I was far from sharing this joy, and finding myself among\r\npeople with whom I could talk freely, I gave my reasons.\r\n\r\n\"The National Guard of Paris,\" I said, \"has upset a Cabinet; therefore\r\nit is during its good pleasure only that the new Ministers will remain\r\nat the head of affairs. You are glad because the Government is upset;\r\nbut do you not see that it is authority itself which is overthrown?\"\r\n\r\nThis sombre view of the political situation was not much to Beaumont's\r\ntaste; he was carried away by rancour and ambition.\r\n\r\n\"You always take a gloomy view of everything,\" he said. \"Let us first\r\nrejoice at the victory: we can lament over the results later.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Beaumont, who was present at the interview, seemed herself to\r\nshare her husband's elation, and nothing ever so thoroughly proved to me\r\nthe irresistible power of party feeling. For, by nature, neither hatred\r\nnor self-interest had a place in the heart of this distinguished and\r\nattractive woman, one of the most truly and consistently virtuous that I\r\nhave met in my life, and one who best knew how to make virtue both\r\ntouching and lovable. To the nobility of heart of the La Fayettes she\r\nadded a mind that was witty, refined, kindly and just.\r\n\r\nI, nevertheless, sustained my theory against both him and her, arguing\r\nthat upon the whole the incident was a regrettable one, or rather that\r\nwe should see more in it than a mere incident, a great event which was\r\ndestined to change the whole aspect of affairs. It was very easy for me\r\nto philosophize thus, since I did not share the illusions of my friend\r\nDufaure. The impulse given to the political machine seemed to me to be\r\ntoo violent to permit of the reins of government falling into the hands\r\nof the moderate party to which I belonged, and I foresaw that they would\r\nsoon fall to those who were almost as obnoxious to me as the men from\r\nwhose hands they had slipped.\r\n\r\nI was dining with another of my friends, M. Lanjuinais, of whom I shall\r\nhave to speak often in future. The company was fairly numerous, and\r\nembraced many shades of political opinion. Many of the guests rejoiced\r\nat the result of the day's work, while others expressed alarm; but all\r\nthought that the insurrectionary movement would stop of its own accord,\r\nto break out again later on another occasion and in another form. All\r\nthe rumours that reached us from the town seemed to confirm this belief;\r\ncries of war were replaced by cries of joy. Portalis, who became\r\nAttorney-General of Paris a few days later, was of our number: not the\r\nson, but the nephew of the Chief President of the Court of Appeal. This\r\nPortalis had neither his uncle's rare intelligence, nor his exemplary\r\ncharacter, nor his solemn dulness. His coarse, violent, perverse mind\r\nhad quite naturally entered into all the false ideas and extreme\r\nopinions of our times. Although he was in relation with most of those\r\nwho are regarded as the authors and leaders of the Revolution of 1848, I\r\ncan conscientiously declare that he did not that night expect the\r\nrevolution any more than we did. I am convinced that, even at that\r\nsupreme moment, the same might have been said of the greater number of\r\nhis friends. It would be a waste of time to try to discover what secret\r\nconspiracies brought about events of this kind. Revolutions accomplished\r\nby means of popular risings are generally longed for beforehand rather\r\nthan premeditated. Those who boast of having contrived them have done no\r\nmore than turn them to account. They spring spontaneously into being\r\nfrom a general malady of men's minds, brought suddenly to the critical\r\nstage by some fortuitous and unforeseen circumstance. As to the\r\nso-called originators or leaders of these revolutions, they originate\r\nand lead nothing; their only merit is identical with that of the\r\nadventurers who have discovered most of the unknown countries. They\r\nsimply have the courage to go straight before them as long as the wind\r\nimpels them.\r\n\r\nI took my leave early, and went straight home to bed. Although I lived\r\nclose to the Foreign Office, I did not hear the firing which so greatly\r\ninfluenced our destinies, and I fell asleep without realizing that I had\r\nseen the last day of the Monarchy of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     THE 24TH OF FEBRUARY--THE MINISTERS' PLAN OF RESISTANCE--THE\r\n     NATIONAL GUARD--GENERAL BEDEAU.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning was the 24th of February. On leaving my bed-room, I met\r\nthe cook, who had been out; the good woman was quite beside herself, and\r\npoured out a sorrowing rigmarole, of which I failed to understand a\r\nword, except that the Government was massacring the poor people. I went\r\ndownstairs at once, and had no sooner set foot in the street than I\r\nbreathed for the first time the atmosphere of revolution. The roadway\r\nwas empty; the shops were not open; there were no carriages nor\r\npedestrians to be seen; none of the ordinary hawkers' cries were heard;\r\nneighbours stood talking in little groups at their doors, with subdued\r\nvoices, with a frightened air; every face seemed distorted with fear or\r\nanger. I met a National Guard hurrying along, gun in hand, with a tragic\r\ngait; I accosted him, but I could learn nothing from him, save that the\r\nGovernment was massacring the people (to which he added that the\r\nNational Guard would know how to put that right). It was the same old\r\nrefrain: it is easily understood that this explanation explained\r\nnothing. I was too well acquainted with the vices of the Government of\r\nJuly not to know that cruelty was not one of them. I considered it one\r\nof the most corrupt, but also one of the least bloodthirsty, that had\r\never existed, and I only repeat this observation in order to show the\r\nsort of report that assists the progress of revolutions.\r\n\r\nI hastened to M. de Beaumont, who lived in the next street. There I\r\nlearnt that the King had sent for him during the night. The same reply\r\nwas given to my enquiry at M. de Remusat's, where I went next. M. de\r\nCorcelles, whom I met in the street, gave me his account of what was\r\nhappening, but in a very confused manner; for, in a city in state of\r\nrevolution, as on a battle-field, each one readily regards the incidents\r\nof which himself is a witness as the events of the day. He told me of\r\nthe firing on the Boulevard des Capucines, and of the rapid development\r\nof the insurrection of which this act of unnecessary violence was the\r\ncause or the pretext; of M. Mole's refusal to take office under these\r\ncircumstances; and lastly, of the summons to the Palace of Messrs.\r\nThiers, Barrot and their friends, who were definitely charged with the\r\nformation of a cabinet, facts too well known to permit of my lingering\r\nover them. I asked M. de Corcelles how the ministers proposed to set\r\nabout appeasing people's minds.\r\n\r\n\"M. de Remusat,\" said he, \"is my authority for saying that the plan\r\nadopted is to withdraw all the troops and to flood Paris with National\r\nGuards.\" These were his own words.\r\n\r\nI have always observed that in politics people were often ruined through\r\npossessing too good a memory. The men who were now charged to put an end\r\nto the Revolution of 1848 were exactly the same who had made the\r\nRevolution of 1830. They remembered that at that time the resistance of\r\nthe army had failed to stop them, and that on the other hand the\r\npresence of the National Guard, so imprudently dissolved by Charles X.,\r\nmight have embarrassed them greatly and prevented them from succeeding.\r\nThey took the opposite steps to those adopted by the Government of the\r\nElder Branch, and arrived at the same result. So true is it that, if\r\nhumanity be always the same, the course of history is always different,\r\nthat the past is not able to teach us much concerning the present, and\r\nthat those old pictures, when forced into new frames, never have a good\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nAfter chatting for a little while on the dangerous position of affairs,\r\nM. de Corcelles and I went to fetch M. Lanjuinais, and all three of us\r\nwent together to M. Dufaure, who lived in the Rue Le Peletier. The\r\nboulevard, which we followed to get there, presented a strange\r\nspectacle. There was hardly a soul to be seen, although it was nearly\r\nnine o'clock in the morning, and one heard not the slightest sound of a\r\nhuman voice; but all the little sentry-boxes which stand along this\r\nendless avenue seemed to move about and totter upon their base, and from\r\ntime to time one of them would fall with a crash, while the great trees\r\nalong the curb came tumbling down into the roadway as though of their\r\nown accord. These acts of destruction were the work of isolated\r\nindividuals, who went about their business silently, regularly, and\r\nhurriedly, preparing in this way the materials for the barricades which\r\nothers were to erect. Nothing ever seemed to me more to resemble the\r\ncarrying on of an industry, and, as a matter of fact, for the greater\r\nnumber of these men it was nothing less. The instinct of disorder had\r\ngiven them the taste for it, and their experience of so many former\r\ninsurrections the practice. I do not know that during the whole course\r\nof the day I was so keenly struck as in passing through this solitude in\r\nwhich one saw, so to speak, the worst passions of mankind at play,\r\nwithout the good ones appearing. I would rather have met in the same\r\nplace a furious crowd; and I remember that, calling Lanjuinais'\r\nattention to those tottering edifices and falling trees, I gave vent to\r\nthe phrase which had long been on my lips, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, this time it is no longer a riot: it is a revolution.\"\r\n\r\nM. Dufaure told us all that concerned himself in the occurrences of the\r\npreceding evening and of the night. M. Mole had at first applied to him\r\nto assist him to form the new Cabinet; but the increasing gravity of the\r\nsituation had soon made them both understand that the moment for their\r\nintervention had passed. M. Mole told the King so about midnight, and\r\nthe King sent him to fetch M. Thiers, who refused to accept office\r\nunless he was given M. Barrot for a colleague. Beyond this point, M.\r\nDufaure knew no more than we did. We separated without having succeeded\r\nin deciding upon our line of action, and without coming to any\r\nresolution beyond that of proceeding to the Chamber so soon as it\r\nopened.\r\n\r\nM. Dufaure did not come, and I never precisely learnt why. It was\r\ncertainly not from fear, for I have since seen him very calm and very\r\nfirm under much more dangerous circumstances. I believe that he grew\r\nalarmed for his family, and desired to take them to a place of safety\r\noutside Paris. His private and his public virtues, both of which were\r\nvery great, did not keep step: the first were always ahead of the\r\nsecond, and we shall see signs of this on more than one subsequent\r\noccasion. Nor, for that matter, would I care to lay this to his account\r\nas a serious charge. Virtues of any kind are too rare to entitle us to\r\nvex those who possess them about their character or their degree.\r\n\r\nThe time which we had spent with M. Dufaure had sufficed to enable the\r\nrioters to erect a large number of barricades along the road by which we\r\nhad come; they were putting the finishing touches to them as we passed\r\non our way back. These barricades were cunningly constructed by a small\r\nnumber of men, who worked very diligently: not like guilty men hurried\r\nby the dread of being taken in the act, but like good workmen anxious to\r\nget their task done well and expeditiously. The public watched them\r\nquietly, without expressing disapproval or offering assistance. I did\r\nnot discover any signs of that sort of general seething which I had\r\nwitnessed in 1830, and which made me at the time compare the whole city\r\nto a huge boiling caldron. This time the public was not overthrowing the\r\nGovernment; it was allowing it to fall.\r\n\r\nWe met on the boulevard a column of infantry falling back upon the\r\nMadeleine. No one addressed a word to it, and yet its retreat resembled\r\na rout. The ranks were broken, the soldiers marched in disorder, with\r\nhanging heads and an air that was both downcast and frightened. Whenever\r\none of them became separated for a mere instant from the main body, he\r\nwas at once surrounded, seized, embraced, disarmed and sent back: all\r\nthis was the work of a moment.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Place du Havre, I met for the first time a battalion of\r\nthat National Guard with which Paris was to be flooded. These men\r\nmarched with a look of astonishment and an uncertain step, surrounded by\r\nstreet boys shouting, \"Reform for ever!\" to whom they replied with the\r\nsame cry, but in a smothered and somewhat constrained voice. This\r\nbattalion belonged to my neighbourhood, and most of those who composed\r\nit knew me by sight, although I knew hardly any of them. They\r\nsurrounded me and greedily pressed me for news; I told them that we had\r\nobtained all we wanted, that the ministry was changed, that all the\r\nabuses complained of were to be reformed, and that the only danger we\r\nnow ran was lest people should go too far, and that it was for them to\r\nprevent it. I soon saw that this view did not appeal to them.\r\n\r\n\"That's all very well, sir,\" said they; \"the Government has got itself\r\ninto this scrape through its own fault, let it get out of it as best it\r\ncan.\"\r\n\r\nIt was of small use my representing to them that it was much less a\r\nquestion for the Government at present than for themselves:\r\n\r\n\"If Paris is delivered to anarchy,\" I said, \"and all the Kingdom is in\r\nconfusion, do you think that none but the King will suffer?\"\r\n\r\nIt was of no avail, and all I could obtain in reply was this astounding\r\nabsurdity: it was the Government's fault, let the Government run the\r\ndanger; we don't want to get killed for people who have managed their\r\nbusiness so badly. And yet this was that middle class which had been\r\npampered for eighteen years: the current of public opinion had ended by\r\ndragging it along, and was driving it against those who had flattered it\r\nuntil it had become corrupt.\r\n\r\nThis was the occasion of a reflection which has often since presented\r\nitself to my mind; in France a government always does wrong to rely\r\nsolely for support upon the exclusive interests and selfish passions of\r\none class. This can only succeed with nations more self-interested and\r\nless vain than ours: with us, when a government established upon this\r\nbasis becomes unpopular, it follows that the members of the very class\r\nfor whose sake it has lost its popularity prefer the pleasure of\r\ntraducing it with all the world to the privileges which it assures them.\r\nThe old French aristocracy, which was more enlightened than our modern\r\nmiddle class and possessed much greater _esprit de corps_, had already\r\ngiven the same example; it had ended by thinking it a mark of\r\ndistinction to run down its own privileges, and by thundering against\r\nthe abuses upon which it existed. That is why I think that, upon the\r\nwhole, the safest method of government for us to adopt, in order to\r\nendure, is that of governing well, of governing in the interest of\r\neverybody. I am bound to confess, however, that, even when one follows\r\nthis course, it is not very certain that one will endure for long.\r\n\r\nI soon set out to go to the Chamber, although the time fixed for the\r\nopening of the sitting had not yet come: it was, I believe, about eleven\r\no'clock. I found the Place Louis XV still clear of people, but occupied\r\nby several regiments of cavalry. When I saw all these troops drawn up in\r\nsuch good order, I began to think that they had only deserted the\r\nstreets in order to mass themselves around the Tuileries and defend\r\nthemselves there. At the foot of the obelisk were grouped the staff,\r\namong whom, as I drew nearer, I recognized Bedeau, whose unlucky star\r\nhad quite recently brought him back from Africa, in time to bury the\r\nMonarchy. I had spent a few days with him, the year before, at\r\nConstantine, and there had sprung up between us a sort of intimacy which\r\nhas since continued. So soon as Bedeau caught sight of me, he sprang\r\nfrom his horse, came up to me, and grasped my hand in a way that clearly\r\nbetrayed his excitement. His conversation gave yet stronger evidence of\r\nthis, and I was not surprised, for I have always observed that the men\r\nwho lose their heads most easily, and who generally show themselves\r\nweakest on days of revolution, are soldiers; accustomed as they are to\r\nhave an organized force facing them and an obedient force in their\r\nhands, they readily become confused before the uproarious shouts of a\r\nmob and in presence of the hesitation and the occasional connivance of\r\ntheir own men. Unquestionably, Bedeau was confused, and everybody knows\r\nwhat were the results of this confusion: how the Chamber was invaded by\r\na handful of men within pistol-shot of the squadrons protecting it, and\r\nhow, in consequence, the fall of the Monarchy was proclaimed and the\r\nProvisional Government elected. The part played by Bedeau on this fatal\r\nday was, unfortunately for himself, of so preponderating a character\r\nthat I propose to stop a moment in order to analyze this man and his\r\nmotives for acting as he did. We have been sufficiently intimate both\r\nbefore and after this event to enable me to speak with knowledge. It is\r\ntrue that he received the order not to fight; but why did he obey so\r\nextraordinary an order, which circumstances had rendered so\r\nimpracticable?\r\n\r\nBedeau was assuredly not timid by nature, nor even, properly speaking,\r\nundecided; for, when he had once made up his mind, you saw him making\r\nfor his goal with great firmness, coolness and courage; but his mind was\r\nthe most methodical, the least self-reliant, the least adventurous, and\r\nthe least adapted for unpremeditated action that can well be imagined.\r\nHe was accustomed to consider the action which he was about to undertake\r\nin all its aspects before setting to work, taking the worst aspects\r\nfirst, and losing much precious time in diluting a single thought in a\r\nmultitude of words. For the rest, he was a just man, moderate,\r\nliberal-minded, as humane as though he had not waged war in Africa for\r\neighteen years, modest, moral, even refined, and religious: the kind of\r\nhonest, virtuous man who is very rarely to be met with in military\r\ncircles, or, to speak plainly, elsewhere. It was assuredly not from want\r\nof courage that he did certain acts which seemed to point to this\r\ndefect, for he was brave beyond measure; still less was treachery his\r\nmotive: although he may not have been attached to the Orleans Family, he\r\nwas as little capable of betraying those Princes as their best friends\r\ncould have been, and much less so than their creatures eventually were.\r\nHis misfortune was that he was drawn into events which were greater than\r\nhimself, and that he had only merit where genius was needed, and\r\nespecially the genius to grapple with revolutions, which consists\r\nprincipally in regulating one's actions according to events, and in\r\nknowing how to disobey at the right time. The remembrance of February\r\npoisoned General Bedeau's life, and left a cruel wound deep down in his\r\nsoul, a wound whose agony betrayed itself unceasingly by endless\r\nrecitals and explanations of the events of that period.\r\n\r\nWhile he was engaged in telling me of his perplexities, and in\r\nendeavouring to prove that the duty of the Opposition was to come down\r\nto the streets in a body and calm the popular excitement with their\r\nspeeches, a crowd of people glided in between the trees of the\r\nChamps-Elysees and came down the main avenue towards the Place Louis XV.\r\nBedeau perceived these men, dragged me towards them on foot until he was\r\nmore than a hundred paces from his cavalry, and began to harangue them,\r\nfor he was more disposed to speech-making than any military man I have\r\never known.\r\n\r\nWhile he was holding forth in this way, I observed that the circle of\r\nhis listeners was gradually extending itself around us, and would soon\r\nclose us in; and through the first rank of sight-seers I clearly caught\r\nsight of men of riotous aspect moving about, while I heard dull murmurs\r\nin the depths of the crowd of these dangerous words, \"It's Bugeaud.\" I\r\nleant towards the general and whispered in his ear:\r\n\r\n\"I have more experience than you of the ways of the populace; take my\r\nword, get back to your horse at once, for if you stay here, you will be\r\nkilled or taken prisoner before five minutes are over.\"\r\n\r\nHe took my word for it, and it was well he did. A few moments later,\r\nthese same men whom he had undertaken to convert murdered the occupants\r\nof the guard-house in the Rue des Champs-Elysees; I myself had some\r\ndifficulty in forcing my way through them. One of them, a short,\r\nthick-set man, who seemed to belong to the lower class of workmen, asked\r\nme where I was going.\r\n\r\nI replied, \"To the Chamber,\" adding, to show that I was a member of the\r\nOpposition, \"Reform for ever! You know the Guizot Ministry has been\r\ndismissed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, I know,\" replied the man, jeeringly, and pointing to the\r\nTuileries, \"but we want more than that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     THE SITTING OF THE CHAMBER--MADAME LA DUCHESSE D'ORLEANS--THE\r\n     PROVISIONAL GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nI entered the Chamber; the sitting had not yet commenced. The deputies\r\nwere wandering about the lobbies like men distraught, living on rumours,\r\nand quite without information. It was not so much an assembly as a mob,\r\nfor nobody was leading it.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of both parties were absent: the ex-ministers had fled, the\r\nnew ones had not appeared. Members cried loudly for the sitting to open,\r\nimpelled rather by a vague desire for action than by any definite\r\nintention; the President refused: he was accustomed to do nothing\r\nwithout instructions, and since there was no one left to instruct him,\r\nhe was unable to make up his mind. I was begged to go and find him, and\r\npersuade him to take the chair, and I did so. I found this excellent\r\nman--for so he was, in spite of the fact that he often indulged in\r\nwell-meaning pieces of trickery, in little pious frauds, in petty\r\nvillainies, in all the venial sins which a faint heart and a wavering\r\nmind are able to suggest to an honest nature--I found him, as I have\r\nsaid, walking to and fro in his room, a prey to the greatest excitement.\r\nM. Sauzet possessed good but not striking features; he had the dignity\r\nof a parish beadle, a big fat body, with very short arms. At times when\r\nhe was restless and perplexed--and he almost always was so--he used to\r\nwave his little arms convulsively, and move them about like a swimmer.\r\nHis demeanour during our conversation was of the strangest: he walked\r\nabout, stopped still, sat down with one foot underneath his clumsy\r\nframe, as he used to do in moments of great excitement, stood up again,\r\nsat down anew, and came to no decision. It was very unfortunate for the\r\nHouse of Orleans that it had an honest man of this kind to preside over\r\nthe Chamber on a day like this: an audacious rogue would have served its\r\nturn better.\r\n\r\nM. Sauzet gave me many reasons for not opening the sitting, but one\r\nwhich he did not give me convinced me that he was right. Seeing him so\r\nhelpless and so incapable of adopting any resolution, I considered that\r\nhe would only confuse men's minds the more he tried to regulate them. I\r\ntherefore left him, and thinking it more important to find protectors\r\nfor the Chamber than to open its deliberations, I went out, intending to\r\nproceed to the Ministry of the Interior and ask for help.\r\n\r\nAs I crossed the Place du Palais-Bourbon with this object, I saw a very\r\nmixed crowd accompanying two men, whom I soon recognized as Barrot and\r\nBeaumont, with loud cheers. Both of them wore their hats crushed down\r\nover their eyes; their clothes were covered with dust, their cheeks\r\nlooked hollow, their eyes weary: never were two men in triumph so\r\nsuggestive of men about to be hanged. I ran up to Beaumont, and asked\r\nhim what was happening. He whispered that the King had abdicated in his\r\npresence, and had taken to flight; that Lamoriciere had apparently been\r\nkilled when he went out to announce the abdication to the rioters (in\r\nfact, an aide-de-camp had come back to say that he had seen him at a\r\ndistance fall from his horse), that everything was going wrong, and\r\nfinally, that he and Barrot were now on their way to the Ministry of the\r\nInterior in order to take possession of it, and to try and establish\r\nsomewhere a centre of authority and resistance.\r\n\r\n\"And the Chamber!\" I said. \"Have you taken any precautions for the\r\ndefence of the Chamber?\"\r\n\r\nBeaumont received this observation with ill-humour, as though I had been\r\nspeaking of my own house. \"Who is thinking of the Chamber?\" he replied\r\nbrusquely. \"What good or what harm can it do at the present juncture?\"\r\n\r\nI thought, and rightly, that he was wrong to speak like this. The\r\nChamber, it is true, was at that moment in a curious state of\r\npowerlessness, its majority despised, and its minority left behind by\r\npublic opinion. But M. de Beaumont forgot that it is just in times of\r\nrevolution that the very least instruments of the law, and much more its\r\nouter symbols, which recall the idea of the law to the minds of the\r\npeople, assume the greatest importance; for it is especially in the\r\nmidst of this universal anarchy and turmoil that the need is felt of\r\nsome simulacrum of authority and tradition in order to save the remnants\r\nof a half-destroyed constitution or to complete its overthrow. Had the\r\ndeputies been able to proclaim the Regency, the latter might have ended\r\nby triumphing, in spite of the unpopularity of the deputies; and, on the\r\nother hand, it is an undoubted fact that the Provisional Government owed\r\nmuch to the chance which caused it to come into being between the four\r\nwalls which had so long sheltered the representatives of the nation.\r\n\r\nI followed my friends to the Ministry of the Interior, where they were\r\ngoing. The crowd which accompanied us entered, or rather swept in,\r\ntumultuously, and even penetrated with us as far as the room which M.\r\nDuchatel had just quitted. Barrot tried to free himself and dismiss the\r\nmob, but was unable to succeed.\r\n\r\nThese people, who held two very different sets of opinions, as I was\r\nthen enabled to observe, some being Republicans and others\r\nConstitutionalists, began vehemently to discuss with us and among\r\nthemselves the measures which were to be taken; and as we were all\r\nsqueezed together in a very small space, the heat, dust, confusion, and\r\nuproar soon became unbearable. Barrot, who always launched out into\r\nlong, pompous phrases at the most critical moments, and who preserved an\r\nair of dignity, and even of mystery, in the most ludicrous\r\ncircumstances, was holding forth at his best _in angustis_. His voice\r\noccasionally rose above the tumult, but never succeeded in quelling it.\r\nIn despair and disgust at so violent and ludicrous a scene, I left this\r\nplace, where they were exchanging almost as many cuffs as arguments, and\r\nreturned to the Chamber.\r\n\r\nI reached the entrance to the building without suspecting what was\r\nhappening inside, when I saw people come running up, crying that Madame\r\nla Duchesse d'Orleans, the Comte de Paris and the Duc de Nemours had\r\njust arrived. At this news, I flew up the stairs of the Palace, four at\r\na time, and rushed into the House.\r\n\r\nI saw the three members of the Royal Family whom I have named, at the\r\nfoot of the tribune, facing the House. The Duchesse d'Orleans was\r\nseated, dressed in mourning, calm and pale; I could see that she was\r\ngreatly excited, but her excitement seemed to be that of courageous\r\nnatures, more prone to turn to heroism than fright.\r\n\r\nThe Comte de Paris displayed the carelessness of his age and the\r\nprecocious impassiveness of princes. Standing by their side was the Duc\r\nde Nemours, tightly clad in his uniform--cold, stiff, and erect. He was,\r\nto my mind, the only man who ran any real danger that day; and during\r\nthe whole time that I saw him exposed to it, I constantly observed in\r\nhim the same firm and silent courage.\r\n\r\nAround these unhappy Princes pressed the National Guards who had come\r\nwith them, some deputies, and a small number of the people. The\r\ngalleries were empty and closed, with the exception of the press\r\ngallery, into which an unarmed but clamorous crowd had forced its way. I\r\nwas more struck by the cries that issued at intervals from there than by\r\nall else that occurred during the sitting.\r\n\r\nFifty years had passed since the last scene of this kind. Since the time\r\nof the Convention, the galleries had been silent, and the silence of the\r\ngalleries had become part of our parliamentary customs. However, if the\r\nChamber at this moment already felt embarrassed in its actions, it was\r\nnot as yet in any way constrained; the deputies were in considerable\r\nnumbers, though the party leaders were still absent. I heard enquiries\r\non every side for M. Thiers and M. Barrot; I did not know what had\r\nbecome of M. Thiers, but I knew only too well what M. Barrot was doing.\r\nI hurriedly sent one of our friends to tell him of what was happening,\r\nand he came running up with all speed. I can answer for that man that\r\nhis soul never knew fear.\r\n\r\nAfter for a moment watching this extraordinary sitting, I had hastened\r\nto take my usual seat on the upper benches of the Left Centre: it has\r\nalways been my contention that at critical moments one should not only\r\nbe present in the assembly of which one is a member, but occupy the\r\nplace where one is generally to be found.\r\n\r\nA sort of confused and turbulent discussion had been opened: I heard M.\r\nLacrosse, who since became my colleague in office, cry amid the uproar:\r\n\r\n\"M. Dupin wishes to speak!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied M. Dupin, \"I made no such request.\"\r\n\r\n\"No matter,\" came from every side; \"speak, speak!\"\r\n\r\nThus urged, M. Dupin ascended the tribune, and proposed in two words\r\nthat they should return to the law of 1842, and proclaim the Duchesse\r\nd'Orleans Regent. This was received with applause in the Assembly,\r\nexclamations in the gallery, and murmurs in the lobbies. The lobbies,\r\nwhich at first were pretty clear, began to grow crowded in an alarming\r\nmanner. The people did not yet come into the Chamber in streams, but\r\nentered little by little, one by one; each moment there appeared a new\r\nface; the Chamber grew flooded as it were by drops. Most of the\r\nnew-comers belonged to the lowest classes; many of them were armed.\r\n\r\nI witnessed this growing invasion from a distance, and I felt the danger\r\nmomentarily increase with it. I cast my eyes round the Chamber in search\r\nof the man best able to resist the torrent; I saw only Lamartine, who\r\nhad the necessary position and the requisite capacity to make the\r\nattempt; I remembered that in 1842 he was the only one who proposed the\r\nregency of the Duchesse d'Orleans. On the other hand, his recent\r\nspeeches, and especially his recent writings, had obtained for him the\r\nfavour of the people. His talent, moreover, was of a kind that appeals\r\nto the popular taste. I was not aware that, half an hour before, he had\r\nbeen extolling the Republic to an assemblage of journalists and deputies\r\nin one of the offices of the Chamber. I saw him standing by his bench. I\r\nelbowed my way to him, and, when I reached him:\r\n\r\n\"We shall be lost,\" I whispered, hurriedly: \"you alone can make yourself\r\nheard at this supreme moment; go to the tribune and speak.\"\r\n\r\nI can see him still, as I write these lines, so struck was I with his\r\nappearance. I see his long, straight, slender figure, his eye turned\r\ntowards the semi-circle, his fixed and vacant gaze absorbed in inward\r\ncontemplation rather than in observing what was passing around him. When\r\nhe heard me speak, he did not turn towards me, but only stretched out\r\nhis arm towards the place where the Princes stood, and, replying to his\r\nown thought rather than to mine, said:\r\n\r\n\"I shall not speak so long as that woman and that child remain where\r\nthey are.\"\r\n\r\nI said no more; I had heard enough. Returning to my bench, I passed by\r\nthe Right Centre, near where Lanjuinais and Billault were sitting, and\r\nasked, \"Can you suggest nothing that we could do?\" They mournfully shook\r\ntheir heads, and I continued on my way.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the crowd had accumulated to such an extent in the\r\nsemi-circle, that the Princes ran the risk of being crushed or\r\nsuffocated at any moment.\r\n\r\nThe President made vain efforts to clear the House; failing in his\r\nendeavours, he begged the Duchesse d'Orleans to withdraw. The courageous\r\nPrincess refused, whereupon her friends, with great difficulty,\r\nextricated her from the throng, and made her climb to the top bench of\r\nthe Left Centre, where she sat down with her son and the Duc de Nemours.\r\n\r\nMarie and Cremieux had just, amid the silence of the deputies and the\r\nacclamations of the people, proposed the establishment of a provisional\r\ngovernment, when Barrot at last appeared. He was out of breath, but not\r\nalarmed. Climbing the stairs of the tribune:\r\n\r\n\"Our duty lies before us,\" he said; \"the Crown of July lies on the head\r\nof a child and a woman.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chamber, recovering its courage, plucked up heart to burst into\r\nacclamations, and the people in their turn were silent. The Duchesse\r\nd'Orleans rose from her seat, seemed to wish to speak, hesitated,\r\nlistened to timid counsels, and sat down again: the last glimmer of her\r\nfortune had gone out. Barrot finished his speech without renewing the\r\nimpression of his opening words; nevertheless, the Chamber had gathered\r\nstrength, and the people wavered.\r\n\r\nAt that moment, the crowd filling the semi-circle was driven back, by a\r\nstream from outside, towards the centre benches, which were already\r\nalmost deserted; it burst and spread over the benches. Of the few\r\ndeputies who still occupied them, some slipped away and left the House,\r\nwhile others retreated from bench to bench, like victims surprised by\r\nthe tide, who retreat from rock to rock always pursued by the rising\r\nwaters. All this commotion was produced by two troops of men, for the\r\nmost part armed, which marched through the two lobbies, each with\r\nofficers of the National Guards and flags at its head. The two officers\r\nwho carried the flags, of whom one, a swaggering individual, was, as I\r\nheard later, a half-pay colonel called Dumoulin, ascended the tribune\r\nwith a theatrical air, waved their standards, and with much skipping\r\nabout and great melodramatic gestures, bawled out some revolutionary\r\nbalderdash or other. The President declared the sitting suspended, and\r\nproceeded to put on his hat, as is customary; but, since he had the\r\nknack of making himself ridiculous in the most tragic situations, in his\r\nprecipitation he seized the hat of a secretary instead of his own, and\r\npulled it down over his eyes and ears.\r\n\r\nSittings of this sort, as may be believed, are not easily suspended, and\r\nthe President's attempts only succeeded in adding to the disorder.\r\n\r\nThenceforth there was nothing but one continuous uproar, broken by\r\noccasional moments of silence. The speakers appeared in the tribune in\r\ngroups: Cremieux, Ledru-Rollin, and Lamartine sprang into it at the same\r\ntime. Ledru-Rollin drove Cremieux out, and himself held on with his two\r\ngreat hands, while Lamartine, without leaving or struggling, waited for\r\nhis colleague to finish speaking. Ledru-Rollin began incoherently,\r\ninterrupted every instant by the impatience of his own friends. \"Finish!\r\nfinish!\" cried Berryer, more experienced than he, and warier in his\r\ndynastic ill-will than was the other in his republican passion.\r\nLedru-Rollin ended by demanding the appointment of a provisional\r\ngovernment and descended the stair.\r\n\r\nThen Lamartine stepped forward and obtained silence. He commenced with a\r\nsplendid eulogium on the courage of the Duchesse d'Orleans, and the\r\npeople themselves, sensible, as always, to generous sentiments wrapped\r\nup in fine phrases, applauded. The deputies breathed again. \"Wait,\" said\r\nI to my neighbours, \"this is only the exordium.\" And in fact, before\r\nlong, Lamartine tacked round and proceeded straight in the same\r\ndirection as Ledru-Rollin.\r\n\r\nUntil then, as I said, all the galleries except the one reserved for the\r\npress had remained empty and closed; but while Lamartine was speaking,\r\nloud blows were heard at the door of one of them, and yielding to the\r\nstrain, the door burst into atoms. In a moment the gallery was invaded\r\nby an armed mob of men, who noisily filled it and soon afterwards all\r\nthe others. A man of the lower orders, placing one foot on the cornice,\r\npointed his gun at the President and the speaker; others seemed to\r\nlevel theirs at the assembly. The Duchesse d'Orleans and her son were\r\nhurried out of the Chamber by some devoted friends and into the corridor\r\nbehind the Chair. The President muttered a few words to the effect that\r\nthe sitting was adjourned, and stepped, or rather slid, off the platform\r\non which the chair was placed. I saw him passing before my eyes like a\r\nshapeless mass: never would I have believed that fear could have\r\ninspired with such activity, or rather, suddenly reduced to a sort of\r\nfluidity, so huge a body. All who had remained of the Conservative\r\nmembers then dispersed, and the populace sprawled over the centre\r\nbenches, crying, \"Let us take the place of the corrupt crew!\"\r\n\r\nDuring all the turbulent scenes which I have just described, I remained\r\nmotionless in my seat, very attentive, but not greatly excited; and now,\r\nwhen I ask myself why I felt no keener emotion in presence of an event\r\nbound to exercise so great an influence upon the destinies of France and\r\nupon my own, I find that the form assumed by this great occurrence did\r\nmuch to diminish the impression it made upon me.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the Revolution of February, I was present at two or\r\nthree scenes which possessed the elements of grandeur (I shall have\r\noccasion to describe them in their turn); but this scene lacked them\r\nentirely, for the reason that there was nothing genuine in it. We\r\nFrench, especially in Paris, are prone to introduce our literary or\r\ntheatrical reminiscences into our most serious demonstrations; this\r\noften gives rise to the belief that the sentiments we express are not\r\ngenuine, whereas they are only clumsily adorned. In this case the\r\nimitation was so evident that the terrible originality of the facts\r\nremained concealed beneath it. It was a time when every imagination was\r\nbesmeared with the crude colours with which Lamartine had been daubing\r\nhis _Girondins_. The men of the first Revolution were living in every\r\nmind, their deeds and words present to every memory. All that I saw that\r\nday bore the visible impress of those recollections; it seemed to me\r\nthroughout as though they were engaged in acting the French Revolution,\r\nrather than continuing it.\r\n\r\nDespite the presence of drawn swords, bayonets and muskets, I was unable\r\nto persuade myself for a single instant not only that I was in danger of\r\ndeath, but that anybody was, and I honestly believe that no one really\r\nwas. Bloodthirsty hatreds only showed themselves later: they had not yet\r\nhad the time to spring up; the special spirit which was to characterize\r\nthe Revolution of February did not yet manifest itself. Meantime, men\r\nwere fruitlessly endeavouring to warm themselves at the fire of our\r\nfathers' passions, imitating their gestures and attitudes as they had\r\nseen them represented on the stage, but unable to imitate their\r\nenthusiasm or to be inflamed with their fury. It was the tradition of\r\nviolent deeds that was being imitated by cold hearts, which understood\r\nnot the spirit of it. Although I clearly saw that the catastrophe of the\r\npiece would be a terrible one, I was never able to take the actors very\r\nseriously, and the whole seemed to me like a bad tragedy performed by\r\nprovincial actors.\r\n\r\nI confess that what moved me most that day was the sight of that woman\r\nand child, who were made to bear the whole weight of faults that they\r\nhad not committed. I frequently looked with compassion towards that\r\nforeign Princess, thrown into the midst of our civil discords; and when\r\nshe had fled, the remembrance of the sweet, sad, firm glances which I\r\nhad seen her cast upon the Assembly during that long agony came back so\r\nvividly to my memory, I felt so touched with pity when I thought of the\r\nperils attending her flight that, suddenly springing from my seat, I\r\nrushed in the direction which my knowledge of the building led me to\r\nbelieve that she and her son would have taken to seek a place of safety.\r\nIn a moment I made my way through the crowd, crossed the floor, passed\r\nout through the cloak-room, and reached the private staircase which\r\nleads from the entrance in the Rue de Bourgogne to the upper floor of\r\nthe Palace. A messenger whom I questioned as I ran past him told me that\r\nI was on the track of the Royal party; and, indeed, I heard several\r\npersons hurriedly mounting the upper portion of the stairs. I therefore\r\ncontinued my pursuit, and reached a landing; the steps which preceded\r\nme had just ceased. Finding a closed door in front of me, I knocked at\r\nit, but it was not opened. If princes were like God, who reads our\r\nhearts and accepts the intention for the deed, assuredly these would be\r\npleased with me for what I wished to do that day; but they will never\r\nknow, for no one saw me and I told no one.\r\n\r\nI returned to the House and resumed my seat. Almost all the members had\r\nleft; the benches were occupied by men of the populace. Lamartine was\r\nstill in the tribune between the two banners, continuing to address the\r\ncrowd, or rather conversing with them; for there seemed to be almost as\r\nmany orators as listeners. The confusion was at its height. In a moment\r\nof semi-silence, Lamartine began to read out a list containing the names\r\nof the different people proposed by I don't know whom to take share in\r\nthe Provisional Government that had just been decreed, nobody knows how.\r\nMost of these names were accepted with acclamations, some rejected with\r\ngroans, others received with jests, for in scenes in which the people\r\ntake part, as in the plays of Shakspeare, burlesque often rubs shoulders\r\nwith tragedy, and wretched jokes sometimes come to the relief of the\r\nardour of revolution. When Garnier-Pages' name was proposed, I heard a\r\nvoice cry, \"You've made a mistake, Lamartine; it's the dead one that's\r\nthe good one;\" Garnier-Pages having had a celebrated brother, to whom he\r\nbore no resemblance except in name.\r\n\r\nM. de Lamartine, I think, was beginning to grow greatly embarrassed at\r\nhis position; for in a rebellion, as in a novel, the most difficult part\r\nto invent is the end. When, therefore, someone took it into his head to\r\ncry, \"To the Hotel de Ville!\" Lamartine echoed, \"Yes, to the Hotel de\r\nVille,\" and went out forthwith, taking half the crowd with him; the\r\nothers remained with Ledru-Rollin, who, in order, I suppose, to retain a\r\nleading part for himself, felt called upon in his turn to go through the\r\nsame mock election, after which he too set out for the Hotel de Ville.\r\nThere the same electoral display was gone through once more; in\r\nconnection with which I cannot refrain from repeating an anecdote which\r\nI was told, a few months later, by M. Marrast. It interrupts the thread\r\nof my story a little, but it gives a marvellous picture of two men who\r\nwere both at that moment playing a great part, and shows the difference,\r\nif not in their opinions, at least in their education and habits of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\"A list of candidates for the Provisional Government,\" said Marrast,\r\n\"had hurriedly been drawn up. It had to be read out to the people, and I\r\nhanded it to Lamartine, asking him to read it aloud from the top of the\r\nsteps. 'I can't,' replied Lamartine, after looking at it; 'my name is on\r\nit.' I then passed it on to Cremieux, who, after reading it, said,\r\n'You're making fun of me: you're asking me to read out to the people a\r\nlist which has not got my name on it!'\"\r\n\r\nWhen I saw Ledru-Rollin leave the House, where remained behind none but\r\nthe sheer dregs of the insurrection, I saw that there was nothing more\r\nto be done there. I accordingly went away, but as I did not care to find\r\nmyself in the middle of the mob marching towards the Hotel de Ville, I\r\ntook the opposite direction, and began to go down those steep steps,\r\nlike cellar stairs, which lead to the inner yard of the Palace. I then\r\nsaw coming towards me a column of armed National Guards, ascending the\r\nsame staircase at a run, with set bayonets. In front of them were two\r\nmen in civilian dress, who seemed to be leading them, shouting at the\r\ntop of their voices, \"Long live the Duchesse d'Orleans and the Regency!\"\r\nIn one I recognized General Oudinot and in the other Andryane, who was\r\nimprisoned in the Spielberg, and who wrote his Memoirs in imitation of\r\nthose of Silvio Pellico. I saw no one else, and nothing could prove more\r\nclearly how difficult it is for the public ever to learn the truth of\r\nevents happening amid the tumult of a revolution. I know that a letter\r\nexists, written by Marshal Bugeaud, in which he relates that he\r\nsucceeded in getting together a few companies of the Tenth Legion,\r\ninspired them in favour of the Duchesse d'Orleans, and led them at the\r\ndouble through the yard of the Palais Bourbon and to the door of the\r\nChamber, which he found empty. The story is true, but for the presence\r\nof the marshal, whom I should most certainly have seen had he been\r\nthere; but there was no one, I repeat, except General Oudinot and M.\r\nAndryane. The latter, seeing me standing still and saying nothing, took\r\nme sharply by the arm, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur, you must join us, to help to free Madame la Duchesse\r\nd'Orleans and save the Monarchy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monsieur,\" I replied, \"your intention is good, but you are too late:\r\nthe Duchesse d'Orleans has disappeared, and the Chamber has risen.\"\r\n\r\nNow, where was the spirited defender of the Monarchy that evening? The\r\nincident is worthy of being told and noted among the many incidents of\r\nversatility with which the history of revolutions abounds.\r\n\r\nM. Andryane was in the office of M. Ledru-Rollin, officiating in the\r\nname of the Republic as general secretary to the Ministry of the\r\nInterior.\r\n\r\nTo return to the column which he was leading: I joined it, although I\r\nhad no longer any hope of success for its efforts. Mechanically obeying\r\nthe impulse communicated to it, it proceeded as far as the doors of the\r\nChamber. There the men who composed it learnt what had taken place; they\r\nturned about for a moment, and then dispersed in every direction. Half\r\nan hour earlier, this handful of National Guards might (as on the\r\nensuing 15th of May) have changed the fortunes of France. I allowed this\r\nnew crowd to pass by me, and then, alone and very pensive, I resumed my\r\nroad home, not without casting a last look on the Chamber, now silent\r\nand deserted, in which, during nine years, I had listened to the sound\r\nof so many eloquent and futile words.\r\n\r\nM. Billault, who had left the Chamber a few minutes before me by the\r\nentrance in the Rue de Bourgogne, told me that he met M. Barrot in this\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\n\"He was walking,\" he said, \"at a rapid rate, without perceiving that he\r\nwas hatless, and that his grey hair, which he generally carefully\r\nbrushed back along his temples, was falling on either side and\r\nfluttering in disorder over his shoulders; he seemed beside himself.\"\r\n\r\nThis man had made heroic efforts all day long to maintain the Monarchy\r\non the declivity down which he himself had pushed it, and he remained as\r\nthough crushed beneath its fall. I learned from Beaumont, who had not\r\nleft him during any part of the day, that in the morning M. Barrot faced\r\nand mounted twenty barricades, walking up to each unarmed, meeting\r\nsometimes with insults, often with shots, and always ending by\r\novercoming with his words those who guarded them. His words, in fact,\r\nwere all-powerful with the multitude. He had all that was wanted to act\r\nupon them at a given moment: a strong voice, an inflated eloquence, and\r\na fearless heart.\r\n\r\nWhile M. Barrot, in disorder, was leaving the Chamber, M. Thiers, still\r\nmore distraught, wandered round Paris, not daring to venture home. He\r\nwas seen for an instant at the Assembly before the arrival of the\r\nDuchesse d'Orleans, but disappeared at once, giving the signal for the\r\nretreat of many others. The next morning, I learnt the details of his\r\nflight through M. Talabot, who had assisted in it. I was connected with\r\nM. Talabot by fairly intimate party ties, and M. Thiers, I believe, by\r\nformer business relations. M. Talabot was a man full of mental vigour\r\nand resolution, very fit for an emergency of that kind. He told me as\r\nfollows--I believe I have neither omitted nor added anything:\r\n\r\n\"It seems,\" he said, \"that M. Thiers, when crossing the Place Louis XV,\r\nhad been insulted and threatened by some of the populace. He was greatly\r\nexcited and upset when I saw him enter the House; he came up to me, led\r\nme aside, and told me that he would be murdered by the mob if I did not\r\nassist him to escape. I took him by the arm and begged him to go with me\r\nand fear nothing. M. Thiers wished to avoid the Pont Louis XVI, for fear\r\nof meeting the crowd. We went to the Pont des Invalides, but when we got\r\nthere, he thought he saw a gathering on the other side of the river, and\r\nagain refused to cross. We then made for the Pont d'Iena, which was\r\nfree, and crossed it without any difficulty. When we reached the other\r\nside, M. Thiers discovered some street-boys, shouting, on the\r\nfoundations of what was to have been the palace of the King of Rome, and\r\nforthwith turned down the Rue d'Auteuil and made for the Bois de\r\nBoulogne. There we had the good luck to find a cabman, who consented to\r\ndrive us along the outer boulevards to the neighbourhood of the\r\nBarriere de Clichy, through which we were able to reach his house.\r\nDuring the whole journey,\" added M. Talabot, \"and especially at the\r\nstart, M. Thiers seemed almost out of his senses, gesticulating,\r\nsobbing, uttering incoherent phrases. The catastrophe he had just\r\nbeheld, the future of his country, his own personal danger, all\r\ncontributed to form a chaos amid which his thoughts struggled and\r\nstrayed unceasingly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THE SECOND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     _Everything contained in this note-book (Chapters I. to XI.\r\n     inclusive) was written in stray moments at Sorrento, in November\r\n     and December 1850, and January, February, and March 1851._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n     MY EXPLANATION OF THE 24TH OF FEBRUARY, AND MY VIEWS AS TO ITS\r\n     EFFECTS UPON THE FUTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so the Monarchy of July was fallen, fallen without a struggle, and\r\nbefore rather than beneath the blows of the victors, who were as\r\nastonished at their triumph as were the vanquished at their defeat. I\r\nhave often, since the Revolution of February, heard M. Guizot and even\r\nM. Mole and M. Thiers declare that this event should only be attributed\r\nto a surprise and regarded as a mere accident, a bold and lucky stroke\r\nand nothing more. I have always felt tempted to answer them in the words\r\nwhich Moliere's Misanthrope uses to Oronte:\r\n\r\n     Pour en juger ainsi, vous avez vos raisons;\r\n\r\nfor these three men had conducted the affairs of France, under the\r\nguidance of King Louis-Philippe, during eighteen years, and it was\r\ndifficult for them to admit that it was the King's bad government which\r\nhad prepared the catastrophe which hurled him from the Throne.\r\n\r\nAs for me, I have not the same motives for forming an opinion, and I\r\ncould hardly persuade myself to be of theirs. I am not prepared to say\r\nthat accidents played no part in the Revolution of February: on the\r\ncontrary, they played a great one; but they were not the only thing.\r\n\r\nI have come across men of letters, who have written history without\r\ntaking part in public affairs, and politicians, who have only concerned\r\nthemselves with producing events without thinking of describing them. I\r\nhave observed that the first are always inclined to find general causes,\r\nwhereas the others, living in the midst of disconnected daily facts, are\r\nprone to imagine that everything is attributable to particular\r\nincidents, and that the wires which they pull are the same that move the\r\nworld. It is to be presumed that both are equally deceived.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I detest these absolute systems, which represent all the\r\nevents of history as depending upon great first causes linked by the\r\nchain of fatality, and which, as it were, suppress men from the history\r\nof the human race. They seem narrow, to my mind, under their pretence of\r\nbroadness, and false beneath their air of mathematical exactness. I\r\nbelieve (_pace_ the writers who have invented these sublime theories in\r\norder to feed their vanity and facilitate their work) that many\r\nimportant historical facts can only be explained by accidental\r\ncircumstances, and that many others remain totally inexplicable.\r\nMoreover, chance, or rather that tangle of secondary causes which we\r\ncall chance, for want of the knowledge how to unravel it, plays a great\r\npart in all that happens on the world's stage; although I firmly believe\r\nthat chance does nothing that has not been prepared beforehand.\r\nAntecedent facts, the nature of institutions, the cast of minds and the\r\nstate of morals are the materials of which are composed those impromptus\r\nwhich astonish and alarm us.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of February, in common with all other great events of\r\nthis class, sprang from general causes, impregnated, if I am permitted\r\nthe expression, by accidents; and it would be as superficial a judgment\r\nto ascribe it necessarily to the former or exclusively to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe industrial revolution which, during the past thirty years, had\r\nturned Paris into the principal manufacturing city of France and\r\nattracted within its walls an entire new population of workmen (to whom\r\nthe works of the fortifications had added another population of\r\nlabourers at present deprived of work) tended more and more to inflame\r\nthis multitude. Add to this the democratic disease of envy, which was\r\nsilently permeating it; the economical and political theories which were\r\nbeginning to make their way and which strove to prove that human misery\r\nwas the work of laws and not of Providence, and that poverty could be\r\nsuppressed by changing the conditions of society; the contempt into\r\nwhich the governing class, and especially the men who led it, had\r\nfallen, a contempt so general and so profound that it paralyzed the\r\nresistance even of those who were most interested in maintaining the\r\npower that was being overthrown; the centralization which reduced the\r\nwhole revolutionary movement to the overmastering of Paris and the\r\nseizing of the machinery of government; and lastly, the mobility of all\r\nthings, institutions, ideas, men and customs, in a fluctuating state of\r\nsociety which had, in less than sixty years, undergone the shock of\r\nseven great revolutions, without numbering a multitude of smaller,\r\nsecondary upheavals. These were the general causes without which the\r\nRevolution of February would have been impossible. The principal\r\naccidents which led to it were the passions of the dynastic Opposition,\r\nwhich brought about a riot in proposing a reform; the suppression of\r\nthis riot, first over-violent, and then abandoned; the sudden\r\ndisappearance of the old Ministry, unexpectedly snapping the threads of\r\npower, which the new ministers, in their confusion, were unable either\r\nto seize upon or to reunite; the mistakes and disorder of mind of these\r\nministers, so powerless to re-establish that which they had been strong\r\nenough to overthrow; the vacillation of the generals; the absence of the\r\nonly Princes who possessed either personal energy or popularity; and\r\nabove all, the senile imbecility of King Louis-Philippe, his weakness,\r\nwhich no one could have foreseen, and which still remains almost\r\nincredible, after the event has proved it.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes asked myself what could have produced this sudden and\r\nunprecedented depression in the King's mind. Louis-Philippe had spent\r\nhis life in the midst of revolutions, and certainly lacked neither\r\nexperience, courage, nor readiness of mind, although these qualities all\r\nfailed him so completely on that day. In my opinion, his weakness was\r\ndue to his excessive surprise; he was overwhelmed with consternation\r\nbefore he had grasped the meaning of things. The Revolution of February\r\nwas _unforeseen_ by all, but by him more than any other; he had been\r\nprepared for it by no warning from the outside, for since many years his\r\nmind had withdrawn into that sort of haughty solitude into which in the\r\nend the intellect almost always settles down of princes who have long\r\nlived happily, and who, mistaking luck for genius, refuse to listen to\r\nanything, because they think that there is nothing left for them to\r\nlearn from anybody. Besides, Louis-Philippe had been deceived, as I have\r\nalready said that his ministers were, by the misleading light cast by\r\nantecedent facts upon present times. One might draw a strange picture of\r\nall the errors which have thus been begotten, one by the other, without\r\nresembling each other. We see Charles I. driven to tyranny and violence\r\nat the sight of the progress which the spirit of opposition had made in\r\nEngland during the gentle reign of his father; Louis XVI. determined to\r\nsuffer everything because Charles I. had perished by refusing to endure\r\nanything; Charles X. provoking the Revolution, because he had with his\r\nown eyes beheld the weakness of Louis XVI.; and lastly, Louis-Philippe,\r\nwho had more perspicacity than any of them, imagining that, in order to\r\nremain on the Throne, all he had to do was to observe the letter of the\r\nlaw while violating its spirit, and that, provided he himself kept\r\nwithin the bounds of the Charter, the nation would never exceed them. To\r\nwarp the spirit of the Constitution without changing the letter; to set\r\nthe vices of the country in opposition to each other; gently to drown\r\nrevolutionary passion in the love of material enjoyment: such was the\r\nidea of his whole life. Little by little, it had become, not his\r\nleading, but his sole idea. He had wrapped himself in it, he had lived\r\nin it; and when he suddenly saw that it was a false idea, he became like\r\na man who is awakened in the night by an earthquake, and who, feeling\r\nhis house crumbling in the darkness, and the very ground seeming to yawn\r\nbeneath his feet, remains distracted amid this unforeseen and universal\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nI am arguing very much at my ease to-day concerning the causes that\r\nbrought about the events of the 24th of February; but on the afternoon\r\nof that day I had many other things in my head: I was thinking of the\r\nevents themselves, and sought less for what had produced them than for\r\nwhat was to follow.\r\n\r\nI returned slowly home. I explained in a few words to Madame de\r\nTocqueville what I had seen, and sat down in a corner to think. I cannot\r\nremember ever feeling my soul so full of sadness. It was the second\r\nrevolution I had seen accomplish itself, before my eyes, within\r\nseventeen years!\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of July 1830, at daybreak, I had met the carriages of King\r\nCharles X. on the outer boulevards of Versailles, with damaged\r\nescutcheons, proceeding at a foot pace, in Indian file, like a funeral,\r\nand I was unable to restrain my tears at the sight. This time my\r\nimpressions were of another kind, but even keener. Both revolutions had\r\nafflicted me; but how much more bitter were the impressions caused by\r\nthe last! I had until the end felt a remnant of hereditary affection for\r\nCharles X.; but that King fell for having violated rights that were dear\r\nto me, and I had every hope that my country's freedom would be revived\r\nrather than extinguished by his fall. But now this freedom seemed dead;\r\nthe Princes who were fleeing were nothing to me, but I felt that the\r\ncause I had at heart was lost.\r\n\r\nI had spent the best days of my youth amid a society which seemed to\r\nincrease in greatness and prosperity as it increased in liberty; I had\r\nconceived the idea of a balanced, regulated liberty, held in check by\r\nreligion, custom and law; the attractions of this liberty had touched\r\nme; it had become the passion of my life; I felt that I could never be\r\nconsoled for its loss, and that I must renounce all hope of its\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nI had gained too much experience of mankind to be able to content myself\r\nwith empty words; I knew that, if one great revolution is able to\r\nestablish liberty in a country, a number of succeeding revolutions make\r\nall regular liberty impossible for very many years.\r\n\r\nI could not yet know what would issue from this last revolution, but I\r\nwas already convinced that it could give birth to nothing that would\r\nsatisfy me; and I foresaw that, whatever might be the lot reserved for\r\nour posterity, our own fate was to drag on our lives miserably amid\r\nalternate reactions of licence and oppression.\r\n\r\nI began to pass in review the history of our last sixty years, and I\r\nsmiled bitterly when I thought of the illusions formed at the conclusion\r\nof each period in this long revolution; the theories on which these\r\nillusions had been fed; the sapient dreams of our historians, and all\r\nthe ingenious and deceptive systems by the aid of which it had been\r\nendeavoured to explain a present which was still incorrectly seen, and a\r\nfuture which was not seen at all.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Monarchy had succeeded the Ancien Regime; the\r\nRepublic, the Monarchy; the Empire, the Republic; the Restoration, the\r\nEmpire; and then came the Monarchy of July. After each of these\r\nsuccessive changes it was said that the French Revolution, having\r\naccomplished what was presumptuously called its work, was finished; this\r\nhad been said and it had been believed. Alas! I myself had hoped it\r\nunder the Restoration, and again after the fall of the Government of the\r\nRestoration; and here is the French Revolution beginning over again, for\r\nit is still the same one. As we go on, its end seems farther off and\r\nshrouded in greater darkness. Shall we ever--as we are assured by other\r\nprophets, perhaps as delusive as their predecessors--shall we ever\r\nattain a more complete and more far-reaching social transformation than\r\nour fathers foresaw and desired, and than we ourselves are able to\r\nforesee; or are we not destined simply to end in a condition of\r\nintermittent anarchy, the well-known chronic and incurable complaint of\r\nold races? As for me, I am unable to say; I do not know when this long\r\nvoyage will be ended; I am weary of seeing the shore in each successive\r\nmirage, and I often ask myself whether the _terra firma_ we are seeking\r\ndoes really exist, and whether we are not doomed to rove upon the seas\r\nfor ever.\r\n\r\nI spent the rest of the day with Ampere, who was my colleague at the\r\nInstitute, and one of my best friends. He came to discover what had\r\nbecome of me in the affray, and to ask himself to dinner. I wished at\r\nfirst to relieve myself by making him share my vexation; but I soon\r\nperceived that his impression was not the same as mine, and that he\r\nlooked differently upon the revolution which was in progress. Ampere was\r\na man of intelligence and, better still, a man full of heart, gentle in\r\nmanner, and reliable. His good-nature caused him to be liked; and he was\r\npopular because of his versatile, witty, amusing, good-humoured\r\nconversation, in which he made many remarks that were at once\r\nentertaining and agreeable to hear, but too shallow to remember.\r\nUnfortunately, he was inclined to carry the _esprit_ of the salons into\r\nliterature and the _esprit_ of literature into politics. What I call\r\nliterary _esprit_ in politics consists in seeking for what is novel and\r\ningenious rather than for what is true; in preferring the showy to the\r\nuseful; in showing one's self very sensible to the playing and elocution\r\nof the actors, without regard to the results of the play; and, lastly,\r\nin judging by impressions rather than reasons. I need not say that this\r\neccentricity exists among others besides Academicians. To tell the\r\ntruth, the whole nation is a little inclined that way, and the French\r\nPublic very often takes a man-of-letters' view of politics. Ampere held\r\nthe fallen Government in great contempt, and its last actions had\r\nirritated him greatly. Moreover, he had witnessed many instances of\r\ncourage, disinterestedness, and even generosity among the insurgents;\r\nand he had been bitten by the popular excitement.\r\n\r\nI saw that he not only did not enter into my view, but that he was\r\ndisposed to take quite an opposite one. Seeing this, I was suddenly\r\nimpelled to turn against Ampere all the feelings of indignation, grief\r\nand anger that had been accumulating in my heart since the morning; and\r\nI spoke to him with a violence of language which I have often since\r\nrecalled with a certain shame, and which none but a friendship so\r\nsincere as his could have excused. I remember saying to him, _inter\r\nalia_:\r\n\r\n\"You understand nothing of what is happening; you are judging like a\r\npoet or a Paris cockney. You call this the triumph of liberty, when it\r\nis its final defeat. I tell you that the people which you so artlessly\r\nadmire has just succeeded in proving that it is unfit and unworthy to\r\nlive a life of freedom. Show me what experience has taught it! Where are\r\nthe new virtues it has gained, the old vices it has laid aside? No, I\r\ntell you, it is always the same, as impatient, as thoughtless, as\r\ncontemptuous of law and order, as easily led and as cowardly in the\r\npresence of danger as its fathers were before it. Time has altered it in\r\nno way, and has left it as frivolous in serious matters as it used to be\r\nin trifles.\"\r\n\r\nAfter much vociferation we both ended by appealing to the future, that\r\nenlightened and upright judge who always, alas! arrives too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     PARIS ON THE MORROW OF THE 24TH OF FEBRUARY AND THE NEXT DAYS--THE\r\n     SOCIALISTIC CHARACTER OF THE NEW REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night passed without accidents, although not until the morning did\r\nthe streets cease to resound with cries and gun-shots; but these were\r\nsounds of triumph, not of combat. So soon as it was light, I went out to\r\nobserve the appearance of the town, and to discover what had become of\r\nmy two young nephews,[8] who were being educated at the Little Seminary.\r\nThe Little Seminary was in the Rue de Madame, at the back of the\r\nLuxembourg, so that I had to cross a great part of the town to reach it.\r\n\r\n     [8: Hubert and Rene de Tocqueville.--Cte. de T.]\r\n\r\nI found the streets quiet, and even half deserted, as they usually are\r\nin Paris on a Sunday morning, when the rich are still asleep and the\r\npoor are resting. From time to time, along the walls, one met the\r\nvictors of the preceding day; but they were filled with wine rather than\r\npolitical ardour, and were, for the most part, making for their homes\r\nwithout taking heed of the passers-by. A few shops were open, and one\r\ncaught sight of the frightened, but still more astonished, shopkeepers,\r\nwho reminded one of spectators witnessing the end of a play which they\r\ndid not quite understand. What one saw most of in the streets deserted\r\nby the people, was soldiers; some walking singly, others in little\r\ngroups, all unarmed, and crossing the city on their roads home. The\r\ndefeat these men had just sustained had left a very vivid and lasting\r\nimpression of shame and anger upon them. This was noticed later, but was\r\nnot apparent at the time: the pleasure of finding themselves at liberty\r\nseemed to absorb every other feeling in these lads; they walked with a\r\ncareless air, with a light and easy gait.\r\n\r\nThe Little Seminary had not been attacked nor even insulted. My nephews,\r\nhowever, were not there; they had been sent home the evening before to\r\ntheir maternal grandmother. Accordingly, I turned back, taking the Rue\r\ndu Bac, to find out what had become of Lamoriciere, who was then living\r\nin that street; and it was only after recognizing me that the servants\r\nadmitted that their master was at home, and consented to take me to him.\r\n\r\nI found this singular person, whom I shall have occasion to mention more\r\nthan once, stretched upon his bed, and reduced to a state of immobility\r\nvery much opposed to his character or taste. His head was half broken\r\nopen; his arms pierced with bayonet-thrusts; all his limbs bruised and\r\npowerless. For the rest, he was the same as ever, with his bright\r\nintelligence and his indomitable heart. He told me of all that happened\r\nto him the day before, and of the thousand dangers which he had only\r\nescaped by miracle. I strongly advised him to rest until he was cured,\r\nand even long after, so as not uselessly to endanger his person and his\r\nreputation in the chaos about to ensue: good advice, undoubtedly, to\r\ngive to a man so enamoured of action and so accustomed to act that,\r\nafter doing what is necessary and useful, he is always ready to\r\nundertake the injurious and dangerous, rather than do nothing; but no\r\nmore effective than all those counsels which go against nature.\r\n\r\nI spent the whole afternoon in walking about Paris. Two things in\r\nparticular struck me: the first was, I will not say the mainly, but the\r\nuniquely and exclusively popular character of the revolution that had\r\njust taken place; the omnipotence it had given to the people properly\r\nso-called--that is to say, the classes who work with their hands--over\r\nall others. The second was the comparative absence of malignant passion,\r\nor, as a matter of fact, of any keen passion--an absence which at once\r\nmade it clear that the lower orders had suddenly become masters of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nAlthough the working classes had often played the leading part in the\r\nevents of the First Revolution, they had never been the sole leaders and\r\nmasters of the State, either _de facto_ or _de jure_; it is doubtful\r\nwhether the Convention contained a single man of the people; it was\r\ncomposed of _bourgeois_ and men of letters. The war between the Mountain\r\nand the Girondists was conducted on both sides by members of the middle\r\nclass, and the triumph of the former never brought power down into the\r\nhands of the people alone. The Revolution of July was effected by the\r\npeople, but the middle class had stirred it up and led it, and secured\r\nthe principal fruits of it. The Revolution of February, on the contrary,\r\nseemed to be made entirely outside the _bourgeoisie_ and against it.\r\n\r\nIn this great concussion, the two parties of which the social body in\r\nFrance is mainly composed had, in a way, been thrown more completely\r\nasunder, and the mass of the people, which had stood alone, remained in\r\nsole possession of power. Nothing more novel had been known in our\r\nannals. Similar revolutions had taken place, it is true, in other\r\ncountries and other days; for the history of our own times, however new\r\nand unexpected it may seem, always belongs at bottom to the old history\r\nof humanity, and what we call new facts are oftenest nothing more than\r\nfacts forgotten. Florence, in particular, towards the close of the\r\nmiddle ages, had presented on a small scale a spectacle analogous to\r\nours; the noble classes had first been succeeded by the burgher classes,\r\nand then one day the latter were, in their turn, expelled from the\r\ngovernment, and a _gonfalonier_ was seen marching barefoot at the head\r\nof the people, and thus leading the Republic. But in Florence this\r\npopular revolution was the result of transient and special causes, while\r\nwith us it was brought about by causes very permanent and of a kind so\r\ngeneral that, after stirring up France, it was to be expected that it\r\nwould excite all the rest of Europe. This time it was not only a\r\nquestion of the triumph of a party; the aim was to establish a social\r\nscience, a philosophy, I might almost say a religion, fit to be learned\r\nand followed by all mankind. This was the really new portion of the old\r\npicture.\r\n\r\nThroughout this day, I did not see in Paris a single one of the former\r\nagents of the public authority: not a soldier, not a gendarme, not a\r\npoliceman; the National Guard itself had disappeared. The people alone\r\nbore arms, guarded the public buildings, watched, gave orders, punished;\r\nit was an extraordinary and terrible thing to see in the sole hands of\r\nthose who possessed nothing all this immense town, so full of riches, or\r\nrather this great nation: for, thanks to centralization, he who reigns\r\nin Paris governs France. Hence the affright of all the other classes was\r\nextreme; I doubt whether at any period of the Revolution it had been so\r\ngreat, and I should say that it was only to be compared to that which\r\nthe civilized cities of the Roman Empire must have experienced when they\r\nsuddenly found themselves in the power of the Goths and Vandals. As\r\nnothing like this had ever been seen before, many people expected acts\r\nof unexampled violence. For my part I did not once partake of these\r\nfears. What I saw led me to predict strange disturbances in the near\r\nfuture--singular crises. But I never believed that the rich would be\r\npillaged; I knew the men of the people in Paris too well not to know\r\nthat their first movements in times of revolution are usually generous,\r\nand that they are best pleased to spend the days immediately following\r\ntheir triumph in boasting of their victory, laying down the law, and\r\nplaying at being great men. During that time it generally happens that\r\nsome government or other is set up, the police returns to its post, and\r\nthe judge to his bench; and when at last our great men consent to step\r\ndown to the better known and more vulgar ground of petty and malicious\r\nhuman passion, they are no longer able to do so, and are reduced to live\r\nsimply like honest men. Besides, we have spent so many years in\r\ninsurrections that there has arisen among us a kind of morality peculiar\r\nto times of disorder, and a special code for days of rebellion.\r\nAccording to these exceptional laws, murder is tolerated and havoc\r\npermitted, but theft is strenuously forbidden; although this, whatever\r\none may say, does not prevent a good deal of robbery from occurring upon\r\nthose days, for the simple reason that society in a state of rebellion\r\ncannot be different from that at any other time, and it will always\r\ncontain a number of rascals who, as far as they are concerned, scorn the\r\nmorality of the main body, and despise its point of honour when they are\r\nunobserved. What reassured me still more was the reflection that the\r\nvictors had been as much surprised by success as their adversaries were\r\nby defeat: their passions had not had time to take fire and become\r\nintensified in the struggle; the Government had fallen undefended by\r\nothers, or even by itself. It had long been attacked, or at least keenly\r\ncensured, by the very men who at heart most deeply regretted its fall.\r\n\r\nFor a year past the dynastic Opposition and the republican Opposition\r\nhad been living in fallacious intimacy, acting in the same way from\r\ndifferent motives. The misunderstanding which had facilitated the\r\nrevolution tended to mitigate its after effects. Now that the Monarchy\r\nhad disappeared, the battle-field seemed empty; the people no longer\r\nclearly saw what enemies remained for them to pursue and strike down;\r\nthe former objects of their anger, themselves, were no longer there; the\r\nclergy had never been completely reconciled to the new dynasty, and\r\nwitnessed its ruin without regret; the old nobility were delighted at\r\nit, whatever the ultimate consequences might be: the first had suffered\r\nthrough the system of intolerance of the middle classes, the second\r\nthrough their pride: both either despised or feared their government.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in sixty years, the priests, the old aristocracy and\r\nthe people met in a common sentiment--a feeling of revenge, it is true,\r\nand not of affection; but even that is a great thing in politics, where\r\na community of hatred is almost always the foundation of friendships.\r\nThe real, the only vanquished were the middle class; but even this had\r\nlittle to fear. Its reign had been exclusive rather than oppressive;\r\ncorrupt, but not violent; it was despised rather than hated. Moreover,\r\nthe middle class never forms a compact body in the heart of the nation,\r\na part very distinct from the whole; it always participates a little\r\nwith all the others, and in some places merges into them. This absence\r\nof homogeneity and of exact limits makes the government of the middle\r\nclass weak and uncertain, but it also makes it intangible, and, as it\r\nwere, invisible to those who desire to strike it when it is no longer\r\ngoverning.\r\n\r\nFrom all these united causes proceeded that languor of the people which\r\nhad struck me as much as its omnipotence, a languor which was the more\r\ndiscernible, in that it contrasted strangely with the turgid energy of\r\nthe language used and the terrible recollections which it evoked. The\r\nlukewarm passions of the time were made to speak in the bombastic\r\nperiods of '93, and one heard cited at every moment the name and example\r\nof the illustrious ruffians whom no one possessed either the energy or\r\neven a sincere desire to resemble.\r\n\r\nIt was the Socialistic theories which I have already described as the\r\nphilosophy of the Revolution of February that later kindled genuine\r\npassion, embittered jealousy, and ended by stirring up war between the\r\nclasses. If the actions at the commencement were less disorderly than\r\nmight have been feared, on the very morrow of the Revolution there was\r\ndisplayed an extraordinary agitation, an unequalled disorder, in the\r\nideas of the people.\r\n\r\nFrom the 25th of February onwards, a thousand strange systems came\r\nissuing pell-mell from the minds of innovators, and spread among the\r\ntroubled minds of the crowd. Everything still remained standing except\r\nRoyalty and Parliament; yet it seemed as though the shock of the\r\nRevolution had reduced society itself to dust, and as though a\r\ncompetition had been opened for the new form that was to be given to the\r\nedifice about to be erected in its place. Everyone came forward with a\r\nplan of his own: this one printed it in the papers, that other on the\r\nplacards with which the walls were soon covered, a third proclaimed his\r\nloud-mouthed in the open air. One aimed at destroying inequality of\r\nfortune, another inequality of education, a third undertook to do away\r\nwith the oldest of all inequalities, that between man and woman.\r\nSpecifics were offered against poverty, and remedies for the disease of\r\nwork which has tortured humanity since the first days of its existence.\r\n\r\nThese theories were of very varied natures, often opposed and sometimes\r\nhostile to one another; but all of them, aiming lower than the\r\ngovernment and striving to reach society itself, on which government\r\nrests, adopted the common name of Socialism.\r\n\r\nSocialism will always remain the essential characteristic and the most\r\nredoubtable remembrance of the Revolution of February. The Republic\r\nwill only appear to the on-looker to have come upon the scene as a\r\nmeans, not as an end.\r\n\r\nIt does not come within the scope of these Recollections that I should\r\nseek for the causes which gave a socialistic character to the Revolution\r\nof February, and I will content myself with saying that the discovery of\r\nthis new facet of the French Revolution was not of a nature to cause so\r\ngreat surprise as it did. Had it not long been perceived that the people\r\nhad continually been improving and raising its condition, that its\r\nimportance, its education, its desires, its power had been constantly\r\nincreasing? Its prosperity had also grown greater, but less rapidly, and\r\nwas approaching the limit which it hardly ever passes in old societies,\r\nwhere there are many men and but few places. How should the poor and\r\nhumbler and yet powerful classes not have dreamt of issuing from their\r\npoverty and inferiority by means of their power, especially in an epoch\r\nwhen our view into another world has become dimmer, and the miseries of\r\nthis world become more visible and seem more intolerable? They had been\r\nworking to this end for the last sixty years. The people had first\r\nendeavoured to help itself by changing every political institution, but\r\nafter each change it found that its lot was in no way improved, or was\r\nonly improving with a slowness quite incompatible with the eagerness of\r\nits desire. Inevitably, it must sooner or later discover that that which\r\nheld it fixed in its position was not the constitution of the\r\ngovernment but the unalterable laws that constitute society itself; and\r\nit was natural that it should be brought to ask itself if it had not\r\nboth the power and the right to alter those laws, as it had altered all\r\nthe rest. And to speak more specially of property, which is, as it were,\r\nthe foundation of our social order--all the privileges which covered it\r\nand which, so to speak, concealed the privilege of property having been\r\ndestroyed, and the latter remaining the principal obstacle to equality\r\namong men, and appearing to be the only sign of inequality--was it not\r\nnecessary, I will not say that it should be abolished in its turn, but\r\nat least that the thought of abolishing it should occur to the minds of\r\nthose who did not enjoy it?\r\n\r\nThis natural restlessness in the minds of the people, this inevitable\r\nperturbation of its thoughts and its desires, these needs, these\r\ninstincts of the crowd formed in a certain sense the fabric upon which\r\nthe political innovators embroidered so many monstrous and grotesque\r\nfigures. Their work may be regarded as ludicrous, but the material on\r\nwhich they worked is the most serious that it is possible for\r\nphilosophers and statesmen to contemplate.\r\n\r\nWill Socialism remain buried in the disdain with which the Socialists of\r\n1848 are so justly covered? I put the question without making any reply.\r\nI do not doubt that the laws concerning the constitution of our modern\r\nsociety will in the long run undergo modification: they have already\r\ndone so in many of their principal parts. But will they ever be\r\ndestroyed and replaced by others? It seems to me to be impracticable. I\r\nsay no more, because--the more I study the former condition of the world\r\nand see the world of our own day in greater detail, the more I consider\r\nthe prodigious variety to be met with not only in laws, but in the\r\nprinciples of law, and the different forms even now taken and retained,\r\nwhatever one may say, by the rights of property on this earth--the more\r\nI am tempted to believe that what we call necessary institutions are\r\noften no more than institutions to which we have grown accustomed, and\r\nthat in matters of social constitution the field of possibilities is\r\nmuch more extensive than men living in their various societies are ready\r\nto imagine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     VACILLATION OF THE MEMBERS OF THE OLD PARLIAMENT AS TO THE ATTITUDE\r\n     THEY SHOULD ADOPT--MY OWN REFLECTIONS ON MY MODE OF ACTION, AND MY\r\n     RESOLVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the days immediately following upon the 24th of February, I\r\nneither went in search of nor fell in with any of the politicians from\r\nwhom the events of that day had separated me. I felt no necessity nor,\r\nto tell the truth, any inclination to do so. I felt a sort of\r\ninstinctive repugnance to remembering this wretched parliamentary world,\r\nin which I had spent six years of my life, and in whose midst I had seen\r\nthe Revolution sprouting up.\r\n\r\nMoreover, at that time I saw the great vanity of any sort of political\r\nconversation or combination. However feeble the reasons may have been\r\nwhich first imparted the movement to the mob, that movement had now\r\nbecome irresistible. I felt that we were all in the midst of one of\r\nthose great floods of democracy in which the embankments, intended to\r\nresist individuals and even parties, only serve to drown those who build\r\nthem, and in which, for a time, there is nothing to be done but to study\r\nthe general character of the phenomenon. I therefore spent all my time\r\nin the streets with the victors, as though I had been a worshipper of\r\nfortune. True, I paid no homage to the new sovereign, and asked no\r\nfavours of it. I did not even address it, but contented myself with\r\nlistening to and observing it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, after the lapse of some days, I resumed relations with the\r\nvanquished: I once more met ex-deputies, ex-peers, men of letters, men\r\nof business and finance, land-owners, all who in the language of the\r\nmoment were commencing to be known as the idle. I found that the aspect\r\nof the Revolution was no less extraordinary when thus seen from above\r\nthan it had seemed to me when, at the commencement, I viewed it from\r\nbelow. I encountered much fear, but as little genuine passion as I had\r\nseen in other quarters; a curious feeling of resignation, no vestige of\r\nhope, and I should almost say no idea of ever returning to the\r\nGovernment which they had only just left. Although the Revolution of\r\nFebruary was the shortest and the least bloody of all our revolutions,\r\nit had filled men's minds and hearts with the idea of its omnipotence to\r\na much greater extent than any of its predecessors. I believe this was,\r\nto a great extent, due to the fact that these minds and hearts were void\r\nof political faith and ardour, and that, after so many disappointments\r\nand vain agitations, they retained nothing but a taste for comfort--a\r\nvery tenacious and very exclusive, but also a very agreeable feeling,\r\nwhich easily accommodates itself to any form of government, provided it\r\nbe allowed to satisfy itself.\r\n\r\nI beheld, therefore, an universal endeavour to make the best of the new\r\nstate of things and to win over the new master. The great landlords\r\nwere glad to remember that they had always been hostile to the middle\r\nclass and always favoured the people; the _bourgeois_ themselves\r\nremembered with a certain pride that their fathers had been working men,\r\nand when they were unable, owing to the inevitable obscurity of their\r\npedigrees, to trace back their descent to a labourer who had worked with\r\nhis hands, they at least strove to discover a plebeian ancestor who had\r\nbeen the architect of his own fortune. They took as great pains to make\r\na display of the latter as, not long before, they would have taken to\r\nconceal his existence: so true is it that human vanity, without changing\r\nits nature, can show itself under the most diverse aspects. It has an\r\nobverse and a reverse side, but it is always the same medal.\r\n\r\nAs there was no longer any genuine feeling left save that of fear, far\r\nfrom breaking with those of his relations who had thrown themselves into\r\nthe Revolution, each strove to draw closer to them. The time had come to\r\ntry and turn to account any scapegrace whom one had in one's family. If\r\ngood luck would have it that one had a cousin, a brother, or a son who\r\nhad become ruined by his disorderly life, one could be sure that he was\r\nin a fair way to succeed; and if he had become known by the promulgation\r\nof some extravagant theory or other, he might hope to attain to any\r\nheight. Most of the commissaries and under-commissaries of the\r\nGovernment were men of this type.\r\n\r\nAs to King Louis-Philippe, there was no more question of him than if he\r\nhad belonged to the Merovingian Dynasty. Nothing struck me more than the\r\nabsolute silence that had suddenly surrounded his name. I did not hear\r\nit pronounced a single time, so to speak, either by the people or by the\r\nupper class. Those of his former courtiers whom I saw did not speak of\r\nhim, and I honestly believe they did not think of him. The Revolution\r\nhad so completely turned their thoughts in another direction, that they\r\nhad forgotten their Sovereign. I may be told that this is the ordinary\r\nfate of fallen kings; but what seems more worthy of remark, his enemies\r\neven had forgotten him: they no longer feared him enough to slander him,\r\nperhaps even to hate him, which is one of fortune's greatest, or at\r\nleast rarest, insults.\r\n\r\nI do not wish to write the history of the Revolution of 1848, I only\r\nwish to retrace my own actions, ideas, and impressions during the course\r\nof this revolution; and I therefore pass over the events that took place\r\nduring the weeks immediately following the 24th of February, and come to\r\nthe period preceding the General Election.\r\n\r\nThe time had come to decide whether one cared merely to watch the\r\nprogress of this singular revolution or to take part in events. I found\r\nthe former party leaders divided among themselves; and each of them,\r\nmoreover, seemed divided also within himself, to judge by the\r\nincoherence of the language used and the vacillation of opinion. These\r\npoliticians, who had almost all been trained to public business amid the\r\nregulated, restrained movement of constitutional liberty, and upon whom\r\na great revolution had unexpectedly come, were like river oarsmen who\r\nshould suddenly find themselves called upon to navigate their boat in\r\nmid-ocean. The knowledge they had acquired in their fresh water trips\r\nwould be of more trouble than assistance to them in this greater\r\nadventure, and they would often display more confusion and uncertainty\r\nthan the passengers themselves.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers frequently expressed the opinion that they should go to the\r\npoll and get elected, and as frequently urged that it would be wiser to\r\nstand aside. I do not know whether his hesitation arose from his dread\r\nof the dangers that might follow upon the election, or his fear lest he\r\nshould not be elected. Remusat, who always sees so clearly what might,\r\nand so dimly what should be done, set forth the good reasons that\r\nexisted for staying at home, and the no less good reasons for going to\r\nthe country. Duvergier was distracted. The Revolution had overthrown the\r\nsystem of the balance of power in which his mind had sat motionless\r\nduring so many years, and he felt as though he were hung up in mid-air.\r\nAs for the Duc de Broglie, he had not put his head out of his shell\r\nsince the 24th of February, and in this attitude he awaited the end of\r\nsociety, which in his opinion was close at hand. M. Mole alone,\r\nalthough he was by far the oldest of all the former parliamentary\r\nleaders, and possibly for that very reason, resolutely maintained the\r\nopinion that they should take part in public affairs and try to lead the\r\nRevolution; perhaps because his longer experience had taught him that in\r\ntroubled times it is dangerous to play the looker-on; perhaps because\r\nthe hope of again having something to lead cheered him and hid from him\r\nthe danger of the undertaking; or perhaps because, after being so often\r\nbent in contrary directions, under so many different _regimes_, his mind\r\nhad become firmer as well as more supple and more indifferent as to the\r\nkind of master it might serve. On my side, as may be imagined, I very\r\nattentively considered which was the best resolution to adopt.\r\n\r\nI should like here to inquire into the reasons which determined my\r\ncourse of action, and having found them, to set them down without\r\nevasion: but how difficult it is to speak well of one's self! I have\r\nobserved that the greater part of those who have written their Memoirs\r\nhave only well shown us their bad actions or their weaknesses when they\r\nhappened to have taken them for deeds of prowess or fine instincts, a\r\nthing which often occurs. As in the case of the Cardinal de Retz, who,\r\nin order to be credited with what he considers the glory of being a good\r\nconspirator, confesses his schemes for assassinating Richelieu, and\r\ntells us of his hypocritical devotions and charities lest he should fail\r\nto be taken for a clever man. In such cases it is not the love of truth\r\nthat guides the pen, but the warped mind which involuntarily betrays the\r\nvices of the heart.\r\n\r\nAnd even when one wishes to be sincere, it is very rarely that one\r\nsucceeds in the endeavour. The fault lies, in the first place, with the\r\npublic, which likes to see one accuse, but will not suffer him to\r\npraise, himself; even one's friends are wont to describe as amiable\r\ncandour all the harm, and as unbecoming vanity all the good, that he\r\nsays of himself: so that at this rate sincerity becomes a very thankless\r\ntrade, by which one has everything to lose and nothing to gain. But the\r\ndifficulty, above all, lies with the subject himself: he is too close to\r\nhimself to see well, and prone to lose himself amid the views,\r\ninterests, ideas, thoughts and inclinations that have guided his\r\nactions. This net-work of little foot-paths, which are little known even\r\nby those who use them, prevent one from clearly discerning the main\r\nroads followed by the will before arriving at the most important\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I will try to discover myself amid this labyrinth, for it\r\nis only right that I should take the same liberties with myself which I\r\nhave taken, and shall often continue to take, with others.\r\n\r\nLet me say, then, that when I came to search carefully into the depths\r\nof my own heart, I discovered, with some surprise, a certain sense of\r\nrelief, a sort of gladness mingled with all the griefs and fears to\r\nwhich the Revolution had given rise. I suffered from this terrible\r\nevent for my country, but clearly not for myself; on the contrary, I\r\nseemed to breathe more freely than before the catastrophe. I had always\r\nfelt myself stifled in the atmosphere of the parliamentary world which\r\nhad just been destroyed: I had found it full of disappointments, both\r\nwhere others and where I myself was concerned; and to commence with the\r\nlatter, I was not long in discovering that I did not possess the\r\nnecessary qualifications to play the brilliant role that I had imagined:\r\nboth my qualities and my defects were impediments. I had not the virtues\r\nnecessary to command respect, and I was too upright to stoop to all the\r\npetty practices which were at that time essential to a speedy success.\r\nAnd observe that this uprightness was irremediable; for it forms so\r\nintegral a part both of my temperament and my principles, that without\r\nit I am never able to turn myself to any account. Whenever I have, by\r\nill-luck, been obliged to speak in defence of a bad cause, or to assist\r\nin bad measures, I have immediately found myself deprived of all talent\r\nand all ardour; and I confess that nothing has consoled me more at the\r\nwant of success with which my uprightness has often met, than the\r\ncertainty I have always been in that I could never have made more than a\r\nvery clumsy and mediocre rogue. I also ended by perceiving that I was\r\nabsolutely lacking in the art of grouping and leading a large number of\r\nmen. I have always been incapable of dexterity, except in _tete-a-tete_,\r\nand embarrassed and dumb in the presence of a crowd; I do not mean to\r\nsay that at a given moment I am unable to say and do what will please\r\nit, but that is not enough: those great occasions are very rare in\r\nparliamentary warfare. The trick of the trade, in a party leader, is to\r\nbe able to mix continually with his followers and even his adversaries,\r\nto show himself, to move about daily, to play continually now to the\r\nboxes, now to the gallery, so as to reach the level of every\r\nintelligence, to discuss and argue without end, to say the same things a\r\nthousand times in different ways, and to be impassioned eternally in the\r\nface of the same objects. These are all things of which I am quite\r\nincapable. I find it troublesome to discuss matters which interest me\r\nlittle, and painful to discuss those in which I am keenly concerned.\r\nTruth is for me so rare and precious a thing that, once found, I do not\r\nlike to risk it on the hazard of a debate; it is a light which I fear to\r\nextinguish by waving it to and fro. And as to consorting with men, I\r\ncould not do so in any habitual and general fashion, because I never\r\nrecognize more than a very few. Unless a person strikes me by something\r\nout of the common in his intellect or opinions, I, so to speak, do not\r\nsee him. I have always taken it for granted that mediocrities, as well\r\nas men of merit, had a nose, a mouth, eyes; but I have never, in their\r\ncase, been able to fix the particular shape of these features in my\r\nmemory. I am constantly inquiring the name of strangers whom I see\r\nevery day, and as constantly forgetting them; and yet, I do not despise\r\nthem, only I consort but little with them, treating them as constant\r\nquantities. I honour them, for the world is made up of them; but they\r\nweary me profoundly.\r\n\r\nWhat completed my disgust was the mediocrity and monotony of the\r\nparliamentary events of that period, as well as the triviality of the\r\npassions and the vulgar perversity of the men who pretended to cause or\r\nto guide them.\r\n\r\nI have sometimes thought that, though the habits of different societies\r\nmay differ, the morality of the politicians at the head of affairs is\r\neverywhere the same. What is very certain is that, in France, all the\r\nparty leaders whom I have met in my time have, with few exceptions,\r\nappeared to me to be equally unworthy of holding office, some because of\r\ntheir lack of personal character or of real parts, most by their lack of\r\nany sort of virtue. I thus experienced as great a difficulty in joining\r\nwith others as in being satisfied with myself, in obeying as in acting\r\non my own initiative.\r\n\r\nBut that which most tormented and depressed me during the nine years I\r\nhad spent in business, and which to this day remains my most hideous\r\nmemory of that time, is the incessant uncertainty in which I had to live\r\nas to the best daily course to adopt. I am inclined to think that my\r\nuncertainty of character arises rather from a want of clearness of idea\r\nthan from any weakness of heart, and that I never experienced either\r\nhesitation or difficulty in following the most rugged road, when once I\r\nclearly saw where it would lead me. But amid all these little dynastic\r\nparties, differing so little in aim, and resembling one another so much\r\nin the bad methods which they put into practice, which was the\r\nthoroughfare that led visibly to honour, or even to utility? Where lay\r\ntruth? Where falsehood? On which side were the rogues? On which side the\r\nhonest men? I was never, at that time, fully able to distinguish it, and\r\nI declare that even now I should not well be able to do so. Most party\r\nmen allow themselves to be neither distressed nor unnerved by doubts of\r\nthis kind; many even have never known them, or know them no longer. They\r\nare often accused of acting without conviction; but my experience has\r\nproved that this was much less frequently the case than one might think.\r\nOnly they possess the precious and sometimes, in politics, even\r\nnecessary faculty of creating transient convictions for themselves,\r\naccording to the passions and interests of the moment, and thus they\r\nsucceed in committing, honourably enough, actions which in themselves\r\nare little to their credit. Unfortunately, I could never bring myself to\r\nilluminate my intelligence with these special and artificial lights, nor\r\nso readily to convince myself that my own advantage was one and the same\r\nwith the general good.\r\n\r\nIt was this parliamentary world, in which I had suffered all the\r\nwretchedness that I have just described, which was broken up by the\r\nRevolution; it had mingled and confounded the old parties in one common\r\nruin, deposed their leaders, and destroyed their traditions and\r\ndiscipline. There had issued from this, it was true, a disordered and\r\nconfused state of society, but one in which ability became less\r\nnecessary and less highly rated than courage and disinterestedness; in\r\nwhich personal character was more important than elocution or the art of\r\nleadership; but, above all, in which there was no field left for\r\nvacillation of mind: on this side lay the salvation of the country; on\r\nthat, its destruction. There was no longer any mistake possible as to\r\nthe road to follow; we were to walk in broad daylight, supported and\r\nencouraged by the crowd. The road seemed dangerous, it is true, but my\r\nmind is so constructed that it is less afraid of danger than of doubt. I\r\nfelt, moreover, that I was still in the prime of life, that I had few\r\nneeds, and, above all, that I was able to find at home the support, so\r\nrare and precious in times of revolution, of a devoted wife, whom a firm\r\nand penetrating mind and a naturally lofty soul would easily maintain at\r\nthe level of every situation and above every reverse.\r\n\r\nI therefore determined to plunge boldly into the arena, and in defence,\r\nnot of any particular government, but of the laws which constitute\r\nsociety itself, to risk my fortune, my person, and my peace of mind. The\r\nfirst thing was to secure my election, and I left speedily for Normandy\r\nin order to put myself before the electors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     MY CANDIDATURE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LA MANCHE--THE ASPECT OF THE\r\n     COUNTRY--THE GENERAL ELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs every one knows, the Department of la Manche is peopled almost\r\nexclusively by farmers. It contains few large towns, few manufactures,\r\nand, with the exception of Cherbourg, no places in which workmen are\r\ngathered in large numbers. At first, the Revolution was hardly noticed\r\nthere. The upper classes immediately bent beneath the blow, and the\r\nlower classes scarcely felt it. Generally speaking, agricultural\r\npopulations are slower than others in perceiving, and more stubborn in\r\nretaining, political impressions; they are the last to rise and the last\r\nto settle down again. The steward of my estate, himself half a peasant,\r\ndescribing what was taking place in the country immediately after the\r\n24th of February, wrote:\r\n\r\n\"People here say that if Louis-Philippe has been sent away, it is a good\r\nthing, and that he deserved it....\"\r\n\r\nThis was to them the whole moral of the play. But when they heard tell\r\nof the disorder reigning in Paris, of the new taxes to be imposed, and\r\nof the general state of war that was to be feared; when they saw\r\ncommerce cease and money seem to sink down into the ground, and when, in\r\nparticular, they learnt that the principle of property was being\r\nattacked, they did not fail to perceive that there was something more\r\nthan Louis-Philippe in question.\r\n\r\nFear, which had first displayed itself in the upper circles of society,\r\nthen descended into the depths of the people, and universal terror took\r\npossession of the whole country. This was the condition in which I found\r\nit when I arrived about the middle of March. I was at once struck by a\r\nspectacle that both astonished and charmed me. A certain demagogic\r\nagitation reigned, it is true, among the workmen in the towns; but in\r\nthe country all the landed proprietors, whatever their origin,\r\nantecedents, education or means, had come together, and seemed to form\r\nbut one class: all former political hatred and rivalry of caste or\r\nfortune had disappeared from view. There was no more jealousy or pride\r\ndisplayed between the peasant and the squire, the nobleman and the\r\ncommoner; instead, I found mutual confidence, reciprocal friendliness,\r\nand regard. Property had become, with all those who owned it, a sort of\r\nbadge of fraternity. The wealthy were the elder, the less endowed the\r\nyounger brothers; but all considered themselves members of one family,\r\nhaving the same interest in defending the common inheritance. As the\r\nFrench Revolution had infinitely increased the number of land-owners,\r\nthe whole population seemed to belong to that vast family. I had never\r\nseen anything like it, nor had anyone in France within the memory of\r\nman. Experience has shown that this union was not so close as it\r\nappeared, and that the former parties and the various classes had drawn\r\ncloser rather than mingled together; fear had acted upon them as a\r\nmechanical pressure might upon very hard bodies, which are compelled to\r\nadhere to one another so long as the pressure continues, but which\r\nseparate so soon as it is relaxed.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, from the first moment I saw no trace whatever of\r\npolitical opinions, properly so-called. One would have thought that the\r\nrepublican form of government had suddenly become not only the best, but\r\nthe only one imaginable for France. Dynastic hopes and regrets were\r\nburied so profoundly in the souls of men that not even the place they\r\nhad once occupied was visible. The Republic respected persons and\r\nproperty, and it was accepted as lawful. In the spectacle I have just\r\ndescribed, I was most struck at witnessing the universal hatred,\r\ntogether with the universal terror, now for the first time inspired by\r\nParis. In France, provincials have for Paris, and for the central power\r\nof which Paris is the seat, feelings analogous to those which the\r\nEnglish entertain for their aristocracy, which they sometimes support\r\nwith impatience and often regard with jealousy, but which at bottom they\r\nlove, because they always hope to turn its privileges to their private\r\nadvantage. This time Paris and those who spoke in its name had so\r\ngreatly abused their power, and seemed to be giving so little heed to\r\nthe rest of the country, that the idea of shaking off the yoke and of\r\nacting for themselves came to many who had never before conceived it:\r\nuncertain and timid desires, it is true, feeble and ephemeral passions\r\nfrom which I never believed that there was much to be either hoped or\r\nfeared; but these new feelings were then turning into electoral ardour.\r\nEveryone clamoured for the elections; for to elect the enemies of the\r\ndemagogues of Paris presented itself to public opinion less as the\r\nconstitutional exercise of a right, than as the least dangerous method\r\none could employ of making a stand against the tyrant.\r\n\r\nI fixed my head-quarters in the little town of Valognes, which was the\r\nnatural centre of my influence; and as soon as I had ascertained the\r\ncondition of the country, I set about my candidature. I then saw what I\r\nhave often observed under a thousand different circumstances, that\r\nnothing makes more for success than not to desire it too ardently. I\r\nvery much wanted to get elected; but in the difficult and critical\r\ncondition of affairs then reigning, I easily reconciled myself to the\r\nidea of being rejected; and from this placid anticipation of a rebuff I\r\ndrew a tranquillity and clearness of mind, a respect for myself and a\r\ncontempt for the follies of the time, that I should perhaps not have\r\nfound in the same degree had I been swayed only by a longing to\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nThe country began to fill with roving candidates, hawking their\r\nprotestations of Republicanism from hustings to hustings. I refused to\r\npresent myself before any other electoral body than that of the place\r\nwhere I lived. Each small town had its club, and each club questioned\r\nthe candidates regarding their opinions and actions, and subjected them\r\nto formulas. I refused to reply to any of these insolent\r\ninterrogatories. These refusals, which might have seemed disdainful,\r\nappeared in the light of dignity and independence in the face of the new\r\nrulers, and I was more esteemed for my rebelliousness than the others\r\nfor their obedience. I therefore contented myself with publishing an\r\naddress and having it posted up throughout the department.\r\n\r\nMost of the candidates had resumed the old customs of '92. When writing\r\nto people they called them \"Citizens,\" and signed themselves\r\n\"fraternally yours.\" I would never consent to adopt this revolutionary\r\nnonsense. I headed my address, \"Gentlemen,\" and ended by proudly\r\ndeclaring myself my electors' \"very humble servant.\"\r\n\r\n     \"I do not come to solicit your suffrages,\" I said, \"I come only to\r\n     place myself at the orders of my country. I asked to be your\r\n     representative when the times were easy and peaceful; my honour\r\n     forbids me to refuse to be so in a period full of agitation, which\r\n     may become full of danger. That is the first thing I had to tell\r\n     you.\"\r\n\r\nI added that I had been faithful to the end to the oath I had taken to\r\nthe Monarchy, but that the Republic, which had been brought about\r\nwithout my aid, should have my energetic support, and that I would not\r\nonly accept but assist it. Then I went on:\r\n\r\n     \"But of what Republic is it a question? There are some who, by a\r\n     Republic, understand a dictatorship exercised in the name of\r\n     liberty; who think that the Republic should not only change\r\n     political institutions but the face of society itself. There are\r\n     some who think that the Republic should needs be of an aggressive\r\n     and propagandist kind. I am not a Republican after this fashion. If\r\n     this were your manner of being Republicans, I could be of no use to\r\n     you, for I should not be of your opinion; but if you understand the\r\n     Republic as I understand it myself, you can rely upon me to devote\r\n     myself heart and soul to the triumph of a cause which is mine as\r\n     well as yours.\"\r\n\r\nMen who show no fear in times of revolution are like princes with the\r\narmy: they produce a great effect by very ordinary actions, because the\r\npeculiar position which they occupy naturally places them above the\r\nlevel of the crowd and brings them very much in view. My address was so\r\nsuccessful that I myself was astonished at it; within a few days it made\r\nme the most popular man in the department of la Manche, and the object\r\nof universal attention. My old political adversaries, the agents of the\r\nold Government, the Conservatives themselves who had so vigorously\r\nopposed me, and whom the Republic had overthrown, came in crowds to\r\nassure me that they were ready not only to vote for me, but to follow my\r\nviews in everything.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the first meeting of the electors of the Arrondissement\r\nof Valognes took place. I appeared together with the other candidates. A\r\nshed did duty for a hall; the chairman's platform was at the bottom, and\r\nat the side was a professorial pulpit which had been transformed into a\r\ntribune. The chairman, who himself was a professor at the College of\r\nValognes, said to me with a loud voice and a magisterial air, but in a\r\nvery respectful tone: \"Citizen de Tocqueville, I will tell you the\r\nquestions which are put to you, and to which you will have to reply;\" to\r\nwhich I replied, carelessly, \"Mr Chairman, pray put the questions.\"\r\n\r\nA parliamentary orator, whose name I will not mention, once said to me:\r\n\r\n\"Look here, my dear friend, there is only one way of speaking well from\r\nthe tribune, and that is to be fully persuaded, as you get into it, that\r\nyou are the cleverest man in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThis had always appeared to me easier to say than to do, in the presence\r\nof our great political assemblies. But I confess that here the maxim was\r\neasy enough to follow, and that I thought it a wonderfully good one.\r\nNevertheless, I did not go so far as to convince myself that I was\r\ncleverer than all the world; but I soon saw that I was the only one who\r\nwas well acquainted with the facts they brought up, and even with the\r\npolitical language they wished to speak. It would be difficult to show\r\none's self more maladroit and more ignorant than did my adversaries;\r\nthey overwhelmed me with questions which they thought very close, and\r\nwhich left me very free, while I on my side made replies which were\r\nsometimes not very brilliant, but which always to them appeared most\r\nconclusive. The ground on which they hoped, above all, to crush me was\r\nthat of the banquets. I had refused, as I have already said, to take\r\npart in these dangerous demonstrations. My political friends had found\r\nfault with me for abandoning them in that matter, and many continued to\r\nbear me ill-will, although--or perhaps because--the Revolution had\r\nproved me to be right.\r\n\r\n\"Why did you part from the Opposition on the occasion of the banquets?\"\r\nI was asked.\r\n\r\nI replied, boldly:\r\n\r\n\"I could easily find a pretext, but I prefer to give you my real reason:\r\nI did not want the banquets because I did not want a revolution; and I\r\nventure to say that hardly any of those who sat down to the banquets\r\nwould have done so had they foreseen, as I did, the events to which\r\nthese would lead. The only difference I can see between you and myself\r\nis that I knew what you were doing while you did not know it\r\nyourselves.\" This bold profession of anti-revolutionary had been\r\npreceded by one of republican faith; the sincerity of the one seemed to\r\nbear witness to that of the other; the meeting laughed and applauded. My\r\nadversaries were scoffed at, and I came off triumphant.\r\n\r\nI had won the agricultural population of the department by my address; I\r\nwon the Cherbourg workmen by a speech. The latter had been assembled to\r\nthe number of two thousand at a patriotic dinner. I received a very\r\nobliging and pressing invitation to attend, and I did.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived, the procession was ready to start for the\r\nbanqueting-hall, with, at its head, my old colleague Havin, who had come\r\nexpressly from Saint-Lo to take the chair. It was the first time I had\r\nmet him since the 24th of February. On that day, I saw him giving his\r\narm to the Duchesse d'Orleans, and the next morning I heard that he was\r\nCommissary of the Republic in the department of la Manche. I was not\r\nsurprised, for I knew him as one of those easily bewildered, ambitious\r\nmen who had found themselves fixed for ten years in opposition, after\r\nthinking at first that they were in it only for a little. How many of\r\nthese men have I not seen around me, tortured with their own virtue, and\r\ndespairing because they saw themselves spending the best part of their\r\nlives in criticizing the faults of others without ever in some measure\r\nrealizing by experience what were their own, and finding nothing to\r\nfeed upon but the sight of public corruption! Most of them had\r\ncontracted during this long abstinence so great an appetite for places,\r\nhonours and money that it was easy to predict that at the first\r\nopportunity they would throw themselves upon power with a sort of\r\ngluttony, without taking time to choose either the moment or the morsel.\r\nHavin was the very type of these men. The Provisional Government had\r\ngiven him as his associate, and even as his chief, another of my former\r\ncolleagues in the Chamber of Deputies, M. Vieillard, who has since\r\nbecome famous as a particular friend of Prince Louis Napoleon's.\r\nVieillard was entitled to serve the Republic, since he had been one of\r\nthe seven or eight republican deputies under the Monarchy. Moreover, he\r\nwas one of the Republicans who had passed through the salons of the\r\nEmpire before attaining demagogism. In literature he was a bigoted\r\nclassic; a Voltairean in religious belief; rather fatuous, very\r\nkind-hearted; an honest man, and even an intelligent; but a very fool in\r\npolitics. Havin had made him his tool: whenever he wished to strike a\r\nblow at one of his own enemies, or to reward one of his own friends, he\r\ninvariably put forward Vieillard, who allowed him to do as he pleased.\r\nIn this manner Havin made his way sheltered beneath the honesty and\r\nrepublicanism of Vieillard, whom he always kept before him, as the miner\r\ndoes his gabion.\r\n\r\nHavin scarcely seemed to recognize me; he did not invite me to take a\r\nplace in the procession. I modestly withdrew into the midst of the\r\ncrowd; and when we arrived at the banqueting-hall, I sat down at one of\r\nthe lower tables. We soon got to the speeches: Vieillard delivered a\r\nvery proper written speech, and Havin read out another written speech,\r\nwhich was well received. I, too, was very much inclined to speak, but my\r\nname was not down, and moreover I did not quite see how I was to begin.\r\nA word which one of the orators (for all the speakers called themselves\r\norators) dropped to the memory of Colonel Briqueville gave me my\r\nopportunity. I asked for permission to speak, and the meeting consented.\r\nWhen I found myself perched in the tribune, or rather in that pulpit\r\nplaced twenty feet above the crowd, I felt a little confused; but I soon\r\nrecovered myself, and delivered a little piece of oratorical fustian\r\nwhich I should find it impossible to recollect to-day. I only know that\r\nit contained a certain appositeness, besides the warmth which never\r\nfails to make itself apparent through the disorder of an improvised\r\nspeech, a merit quite sufficient to succeed with a popular assembly, or\r\neven with an assembly of any sort; for, it cannot be too often repeated,\r\nspeeches are made to be listened to and not to be read, and the only\r\ngood ones are those that move the audience.\r\n\r\nThe success of mine was marked and complete, and I confess it seemed\r\nvery sweet to me to revenge myself in this way on the manner in which\r\nmy former colleague had endeavoured to abuse what he considered the\r\nfavours of fortune.\r\n\r\nIf I am not mistaken, it was between this time and the elections that I\r\nmade my journey to Saint-Lo, as member of the Council General. The\r\nCouncil had been summoned to an extraordinary sitting. It was still\r\ncomposed as under the Monarchy: most of its members had shown themselves\r\ncomplaisant towards Louis-Philippe's ministers, and may be reckoned\r\namong those who had most contributed to bring that Prince's government\r\ninto contempt in our country. The only thing I can recall of the\r\nSaint-Lo journey is the singular servility of these ex-Conservatives.\r\nNot only did they make no opposition to Havin, who had insulted them for\r\nthe past ten years, but they became his most attentive courtiers. They\r\npraised him with their words, supported him with their votes, smiled\r\nupon him approvingly; they even spoke well of him among themselves, for\r\nfear of indiscretion. I have often seen greater pictures of human\r\nbaseness, but never any that was more perfect; and I think it deserves,\r\ndespite its pettiness, to be brought fully to light. I will, therefore,\r\ndisplay it in the light of subsequent events, and I will add that some\r\nmonths later, when the turn of the popular tide had restored them to\r\npower, they at once set about pursuing this same Havin anew with\r\nunheard-of violence and even injustice. All their old hatred became\r\nvisible amid the quaking of their terror, and it seemed to have become\r\nstill greater at the remembrance of their temporary complaisance.\r\n\r\nMeantime the general election was drawing nigh, and each day the aspect\r\nof the future became more sinister. All the news from Paris represented\r\nthe capital as on the point of constantly falling into the hands of\r\narmed Socialists. It was doubted whether these latter would allow the\r\nelectors to vote freely, or at least whether they would submit to the\r\nNational Assembly. Already in every part of the country the officers of\r\nthe National Guard were being made to swear that they would march\r\nagainst the Assembly if a conflict arose between that body and the\r\npeople. The provinces were becoming more and more alarmed, but were also\r\nstrengthening themselves at the sight of the danger.\r\n\r\nI spent the few days preceding the contest at my poor, dear Tocqueville.\r\nIt was the first time I had visited it since the Revolution: I was\r\nperhaps about to leave it for ever! I was seized on my arrival with so\r\ngreat and uncommon a feeling of sadness that it has left in my memory\r\ntraces which have remained marked and visible to this day amid all the\r\nvestiges of the events of that time. I was not expected. The empty\r\nrooms, in which there was none but my old dog to receive me, the\r\nundraped windows, the heaped-up dusty furniture, the extinct fires, the\r\nrun-down clocks--all seemed to point to abandonment and to foretell\r\nruin. This little isolated corner of the earth, lost, as it were, amid\r\nthe fields and hedges of our Norman coppices, which had so often seemed\r\nto me the most charming of solitudes, now appeared to me, in the actual\r\nstate of my thoughts, as a desolate desert; but across the desolation of\r\nits present aspect I discovered, as though from the depth of a tomb, the\r\nsweetest and most attractive episodes of my life. I wonder how our\r\nimagination gives so much deeper colour and so much more attractiveness\r\nto things than they possess. I had just witnessed the fall of the\r\nMonarchy; I have since been present at the most sanguinary scenes; and\r\nnevertheless I declare that none of these spectacles produced in me so\r\ndeep and painful an emotion as that which I experienced that day at the\r\nsight of the ancient abode of my forefathers, when I thought of the\r\npeaceful days and happy hours I had spent there without knowing their\r\nvalue--I say that it was then and there that I best understood all the\r\nbitterness of revolutions.\r\n\r\nThe local population had always been well disposed to me; but this time\r\nI found them affectionate, and I was never received with more respect\r\nthan now, when all the walls were placarded with the expression of\r\ndegrading equality. We were all to go and vote together at the borough\r\nof Saint-Pierre, about one league away from our village. On the morning\r\nof the election, all the voters (that is to say, all the male population\r\nabove the age of twenty) collected together in front of the church. All\r\nthese men formed themselves in a double column, in alphabetical order.\r\nI took up my place in the situation denoted by my name, for I knew that\r\nin democratic times and countries one must be nominated to the head of\r\nthe people, and not place one's self there. At the end of the long\r\nprocession, in carts or on pack-horses, came the sick or infirm who\r\nwished to follow us; we left none behind save the women and children. We\r\nwere one hundred and sixty-six all told. At the top of the hill which\r\ncommands Tocqueville there came a halt; they wished me to speak. I\r\nclimbed to the other side of a ditch; a circle was formed round me, and\r\nI spoke a few words such as the circumstances inspired. I reminded these\r\nworthy people of the gravity and importance of what they were about to\r\ndo; I recommended them not to allow themselves to be accosted or turned\r\naside by those who, on our arrival at the borough, might seek to deceive\r\nthem, but to march on solidly and stay together, each in his place,\r\nuntil they had voted. \"Let no one,\" I said, \"go into a house to seek\r\nfood or shelter [it was raining] before he has done his duty.\" They\r\ncried that they would do as I wished, and they did. All the votes were\r\ngiven at the same time, and I have reason to believe that they were\r\nalmost all given to the same candidate.\r\n\r\nAfter voting myself, I took my leave of them, and set out to return to\r\nParis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n     THE FIRST SITTING OF THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY--THE APPEARANCE OF\r\n     THIS ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI stopped at Valognes only long enough to bid good-bye to some of my\r\nfriends. Many left me with tears in their eyes, for there was a belief\r\ncurrent in the country that the representatives would be exposed to\r\ngreat danger in Paris. Several of these worthy people said to me, \"If\r\nthey attack the National Assembly, we will come and defend you.\" I feel\r\na certain remorse at having seen only vain words in this promise at the\r\ntime; for, as a matter of fact, they did all come, they and many more,\r\nas I shall show later.\r\n\r\nIt was only when I reached Paris that I learnt that I had received\r\n110,704 votes out of a possible 120,000. Most of my new colleagues\r\nbelonged to the old dynastic Opposition: two only had professed\r\nrepublican principles before the Revolution, and were what was called in\r\nthe jargon of the day \"Republicans of yesterday.\" The same was the case\r\nin most parts of France.\r\n\r\nThere have certainly been more wicked revolutionaries than those of\r\n1848, but I doubt if there were ever any more stupid; they neither knew\r\nhow to make use of universal suffrage nor how to do without it. If they\r\nhad held the elections immediately after the 24th of February, while the\r\nupper classes were still bewildered by the blow they had just received,\r\nand the people more amazed than discontented, they would perhaps have\r\nobtained an assembly after their hearts; if, on the other hand, they had\r\nboldly seized the dictatorship, they might have been able for some time\r\nto retain it. But they trusted themselves to the nation, and at the same\r\ntime did all that was most likely to set the latter against them; they\r\nthreatened it while placing themselves in its power; they alarmed it by\r\nthe recklessness of their proposals and the violence of their language,\r\nwhile inviting it to resistance by the feebleness of their actions; they\r\npretended to lay down the law to it at the very time that they were\r\nplacing themselves at its disposal. Instead of opening out their ranks\r\nafter the victory, they jealously closed them up, and seemed, in one\r\nword, to be striving to solve this insoluble problem, namely, how to\r\ngovern through the majority and yet against its inclination.\r\n\r\nFollowing the examples of the past without understanding them, they\r\nfoolishly imagined that to summon the crowd to take part in political\r\nlife was sufficient to attach it to their cause; and that to popularize\r\nthe Republic, it was enough to give the public rights without offering\r\nthem any profits. They forgot that their predecessors, when they gave\r\nevery peasant the vote, at the same time did away with tithes, abolished\r\nstatute labour and the other seignorial privileges, and divided the\r\nproperty of the nobles among the peasants; whereas they were not in a\r\nposition to do anything of the kind. In establishing universal suffrage\r\nthey thought they were summoning the people to the assistance of the\r\nRevolution: they were only giving them arms against it. Nevertheless, I\r\nam far from believing that it was impossible to arouse revolutionary\r\npassions, even in the country districts. In France, every agriculturist\r\nowns some portion of the soil, and most of them are more or less\r\ninvolved in debt; it was not, therefore, the landlords that should have\r\nbeen attacked, but the creditors; not the abolition promised of the\r\nrights of property, but the abolition of debts. The demagogues of 1848\r\ndid not think of this scheme; they showed themselves much clumsier than\r\ntheir predecessors, but no less dishonest, for they were as violent and\r\nunjust in their desires as the others in their acts. Only, to commit\r\nviolent and unjust acts, it is not enough for a government to have the\r\nwill, or even the power; the habits, ideas, and passions of the time\r\nmust lend themselves to the committal of them.\r\n\r\nAs the party which held the reins of government saw its candidates\r\nrejected one after the other, it displayed great vexation and rage,\r\ncomplaining now sadly and now rudely of the electors, whom it treated as\r\nignorant, ungrateful blockheads, and enemies of their own good; it lost\r\nits temper with the whole nation; and, its impatience exhausted by the\r\nlatter's coldness, it seemed ready to say with Moliere's Arnolfe, when\r\nhe addresses Agnes:\r\n\r\n     \"Pourquoi ne m'aimer pas, madame l'impudente?\"\r\n\r\nOne thing was not ridiculous, but really ominous and terrible; and that\r\nwas the appearance of Paris on my return. I found in the capital a\r\nhundred thousand armed workmen formed into regiments, out of work, dying\r\nof hunger, but with their minds crammed with vain theories and visionary\r\nhopes. I saw society cut into two: those who possessed nothing, united\r\nin a common greed; those who possessed something, united in a common\r\nterror. There were no bonds, no sympathy between these two great\r\nsections; everywhere the idea of an inevitable and immediate struggle\r\nseemed at hand. Already the _bourgeois_ and the _peuple_ (for the old\r\nnicknames had been resumed) had come to blows, with varying fortunes, at\r\nRouen, Limoges, Paris; not a day passed but the owners of property were\r\nattacked or menaced in either their capital or income: they were asked\r\nto employ labour without selling the produce; they were expected to\r\nremit the rents of their tenants when they themselves possessed no other\r\nmeans of living. They gave way as long as they could to this tyranny,\r\nand endeavoured at least to turn their weakness to account by publishing\r\nit. I remember reading in the papers of that time this advertisement,\r\namong others, which still strikes me as a model of vanity, poltroonery,\r\nand stupidity harmoniously mingled:\r\n\r\n\"Mr Editor,\" it read, \"I make use of your paper to inform my tenants\r\nthat, desiring to put into practice in my relations with them the\r\nprinciples of fraternity that should guide all true democrats, I will\r\nhand to those of my tenants who apply for it a formal receipt for their\r\nnext quarter's rent.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, a gloomy despair had overspread the middle class thus\r\nthreatened and oppressed, and imperceptibly this despair was changing\r\ninto courage. I had always believed that it was useless to hope to\r\nsettle the movement of the Revolution of February peacefully and\r\ngradually, and that it could only be stopped suddenly, by a great battle\r\nfought in the streets of Paris. I had said this immediately after the\r\n24th of February; and what I now saw persuaded me that this battle was\r\nnot only inevitable but imminent, and that it would be well to seize the\r\nfirst opportunity to deliver it.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly met at last on the 4th of May; it was doubtful\r\nuntil the last moment whether it would meet at all. I believe, in fact,\r\nthat the more ardent of the demagogues were often tempted to do without\r\nit, but they dared not; they remained crushed beneath the weight of\r\ntheir own dogma of the sovereignty of the people.\r\n\r\nI should have before my eyes the picture which the Assembly presented at\r\nits opening; but I find, on the contrary, that only a very confused\r\nrecollection of it has lingered in my mind. It is a mistake to believe\r\nthat events remain present in one's memory in proportion to their\r\nimportance or their greatness alone; rather is it certain little\r\nparticularities which occur, and cause them to penetrate deep into the\r\nmind, and fix them there in a lasting manner. I only remember that we\r\nshouted, \"Long live the Republic\" fifteen times during the course of the\r\nsitting, trying who could out-shout the other. The history of the\r\nAssemblies is full of parallel incidents, and one constantly sees one\r\nparty exaggerating its feelings in order to embarrass its opponents,\r\nwhile the latter feign to hold sentiments which they do not possess, in\r\norder to avoid the trap. Both sides, with a common effort, went either\r\nbeyond, or in the contrary direction to, the truth. Nevertheless, I\r\nthink the cry was sincere enough; only it responded to diverse or even\r\ncontrary thoughts. All at that time wished to preserve the Republic; but\r\nsome wished to use it for purposes of attack, others for purposes of\r\ndefence The newspapers spoke of the enthusiasm of the Assembly and of\r\nthe public; there was a great deal of noise, but no enthusiasm at all.\r\nEveryone was too greatly preoccupied with the immediate future to allow\r\nhimself to be carried beyond that thought by sentiment of any kind. A\r\ndecree of the Provisional Government laid down that the representatives\r\nshould wear the costume of the Conventionals, and especially the white\r\nwaistcoat with turn-down collar in which Robespierre was always\r\nrepresented on the stage. I thought at first that this fine notion\r\noriginated with Louis Blanc or Ledru-Rollin; but I learned later that it\r\nwas due to the flowery and literary imagination of Armand Marrast. No\r\none obeyed the decree, not even its author; Caussidiere was the only one\r\nto adopt the appointed disguise. This drew my attention to him; for I\r\ndid not know him by sight any more than most of those who were about to\r\ncall themselves the Montagnards, always with the idea of keeping up the\r\nrecollection of '93. I beheld a very big and very heavy body, on which\r\nwas placed a sugar-loaf head, sunk deep between the two shoulders, with\r\na wicked, cunning eye, and an air of general good-nature spread over the\r\nrest of his face. In short, he was a mass of shapeless matter, in which\r\nworked a mind sufficiently subtle to know how to make the most of his\r\ncoarseness and ignorance.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the two subsequent days, the members of the Provisional\r\nGovernment, one after the other, told us what they had done since the\r\n24th of February. Each said a great deal of good of himself, and even a\r\ncertain amount of good of his colleagues, although it would be difficult\r\nto meet a body of men who mutually hated one another more sincerely than\r\nthese did. Independently of the political hatred and jealousy that\r\ndivided them, they seemed still to feel towards each other that peculiar\r\nirritation common to travellers who have been compelled to live\r\ntogether upon the same ship during a long and stormy passage, without\r\nsuiting or understanding one another. At this first sitting I met again\r\nalmost all the members of Parliament among whom I had lived. With the\r\nexception of M. Thiers, who had been defeated; of the Duc de Broglie,\r\nwho had not stood, I believe; and of Messrs Guizot and Duchatel, who had\r\nfled, all the famous orators and most of the better-known talkers of the\r\npolitical world were there; but they found themselves, as it were, out\r\nof their element, they felt isolated and suspected, they both felt and\r\ninspired fear, two contraries often to be met with in the political\r\nworld. As yet they possessed none of that influence which their talents\r\nand experience were soon to restore to them. All the remainder of the\r\nAssembly were as much novices as though we had issued fresh from the\r\nAncien Regime; for, thanks to our system of centralization, public life\r\nhad always been confined within the limits of the Chambers, and those\r\nwho were neither peers nor deputies scarcely knew what an Assembly was,\r\nnor how one should speak or behave in one. They were absolutely ignorant\r\nof its most ordinary, everyday habits and customs; and they were\r\ninattentive at decisive moments, and listened eagerly to unimportant\r\nthings. Thus, on the second day, they crowded round the tribune and\r\ninsisted on perfect silence in order to hear read the minutes of the\r\npreceding sitting, imagining that this insignificant form was a most\r\nimportant piece of business. I am convinced that nine hundred English\r\nor American peasants, picked at random, would have better represented\r\nthe appearance of a great political body.\r\n\r\nContinuing to imitate the National Convention, the men who professed the\r\nmost radical and the most revolutionary opinions had taken their seats\r\non the highest benches; they were very uncomfortable up there; but it\r\ngave them the right to call themselves Montagnards, and as men always\r\nlike to feed on pleasant imaginations, these very rashly flattered\r\nthemselves that they bore a resemblance to the celebrated blackguards\r\nwhose name they took.\r\n\r\nThe Montagnards soon divided themselves into two distinct bands: the\r\nRevolutionaries of the old school and the Socialists. Nevertheless, the\r\ntwo shades were not sharply defined. One passed from the one to the\r\nother by imperceptible tints: the Montagnards proper had almost all some\r\nsocialistic ideas in their heads, and the Socialists quite approved of\r\nthe revolutionary proceedings of the others. However, they differed\r\nsufficiently among themselves to prevent them from always marching in\r\nstep, and it was this that saved us. The Socialists were the more\r\ndangerous, because they answered more nearly to the true character of\r\nthe Revolution of February, and to the only passions which it had\r\naroused; but they were men of theory rather than action, and in order to\r\nupset Society at their pleasure they would have needed the practical\r\nenergy and the science of insurrections which only their colleagues in\r\nany measure possessed.\r\n\r\nFrom the seat I occupied it was easy for me to hear what was said on the\r\nbenches of the Mountain, and especially to see what went on. This gave\r\nme the opportunity of studying pretty closely the men sitting in that\r\npart of the Chamber. It was for me like discovering a new world. We\r\nconsole ourselves for not knowing foreign countries, with the reflection\r\nthat at least we know our own; but we are wrong, for even in the latter\r\nthere are always districts which we have not visited, and races which\r\nare new to us. I experienced this now. It was as though I saw these\r\nMontagnards for the first time, so greatly did their idioms and manners\r\nsurprise me. They spoke a lingo which was not, properly speaking, the\r\nFrench of either the ignorant or the cultured classes, but which partook\r\nof the defects of both, for it abounded in coarse words and ambitious\r\nphrases. One heard issuing from the benches of the Mountain a ceaseless\r\ntorrent of insulting or jocular comments; and at the same time there was\r\npoured forth a host of quibbles and maxims; in turns they assumed a very\r\nhumorous or a very superb tone. It was evident that these people\r\nbelonged neither to the tavern nor the drawing-room; I think they must\r\nhave polished their manners in the cafes, and fed their minds on no\r\nliterature but that of the daily press. In any case, it was the first\r\ntime since the commencement of the Revolution that this type made any\r\ndisplay in one of our Assemblies; until then it had only been\r\nrepresented by sporadic and unnoticed individuals, who were more\r\noccupied in concealing than in showing themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly had two other peculiarities which struck me as\r\nquite as novel as this, although very different from it. It contained an\r\ninfinitely greater number of landlords and even of noblemen than any of\r\nthe Chambers elected in the days when it was a necessary condition, in\r\norder to be an elector or elected, that you should have money. And also\r\nthere was a more numerous and more powerful religious party than even\r\nunder the Restoration: I counted three bishops, several vicars-general,\r\nand a Dominican monk, whereas Louis XVIII. and Charles X. had never\r\nsucceeded in securing the election of more than one single abbe.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of all quit-rents, which made part of the electors\r\ndependent upon the rich, and the danger threatening property, which led\r\nthe people to choose for their representatives those who were most\r\ninterested in defending it, are the principal reasons which explain the\r\npresence of so great a number of landlords. The election of the\r\necclesiastics arose from similar causes, and also from a different cause\r\nstill worthier of consideration. This cause was the almost general and\r\nvery unexpected return of a great part of the nation towards the\r\nconcerns of religion.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution of 1792, when striking the upper classes, had cured them\r\nof their irreligiousness; it had taught them, if not the truth, at least\r\nthe social uses of belief. This lesson was lost upon the middle class,\r\nwhich remained their political heir and their jealous rival; and the\r\nlatter had even become more sceptical in proportion as the former seemed\r\nto become more religious. The Revolution of 1848 had just done on a\r\nsmall scale for our tradesmen what that of 1792 had done for the\r\nnobility: the same reverses, the same terrors, the same conversion; it\r\nwas the same picture, only painted smaller and in less bright and, no\r\ndoubt, less lasting colours. The clergy had facilitated this conversion\r\nby separating itself from all the old political parties, and entering\r\ninto the old, true spirit of the Catholic clergy, which is that it\r\nshould belong only to the Church. It readily, therefore, professed\r\nrepublican opinions, while at the same time it gave to long-established\r\ninterests the guarantee of its traditions, its customs and its\r\nhierarchy. It was accepted and made much of by all. The priests sent to\r\nthe Assembly were treated with very great consideration, and they\r\ndeserved it through their good sense, their moderation and their\r\nmodesty. Some of them endeavoured to speak from the tribune, but they\r\nwere never able to learn the language of politics. They had forgotten it\r\ntoo long ago, and all their speeches turned imperceptibly into homilies.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, the universal voting had shaken the country from top to\r\nbottom without bringing to light a single new man worthy of coming to\r\nthe front. I have always held that, whatever method be followed in a\r\ngeneral election, the great majority of the exceptional men whom the\r\nnation possesses definitively succeed in getting elected. The system of\r\nelection adopted exercises a great influence only upon the class of\r\nordinary individuals in the Assembly, who form the ground-work of every\r\npolitical body. These belong to very different orders and are of very\r\ndiverse natures, according to the system upon which the election has\r\nbeen conducted. Nothing confirmed me in this belief more than did the\r\nsight of the Constituent Assembly. Almost all the men who played the\r\nfirst part in it were already known to me, but the bulk of the rest\r\nresembled nothing that I had seen before. They were imbued with a new\r\nspirit, and displayed a new character and new manners.\r\n\r\nI will say that, in my opinion, and taken all round, this Assembly\r\ncompared favourably with those which I had seen. One met in it more men\r\nwho were sincere, disinterested, honest and, above all, courageous than\r\nin the Chambers of Deputies among which I had spent my life.\r\n\r\nThe Constituent Assembly had been elected to make a stand against civil\r\nwar. This was its principal merit; and, in fact, so long as it was\r\nnecessary to fight, it was great, and only became contemptible after the\r\nvictory, and when it felt that it was breaking up in consequence of\r\nthis very victory and under the weight of it.\r\n\r\nI selected my seat on the left side of the House, on a bench from which\r\nit was easy for me to hear the speakers and to reach the tribune when I\r\nwished to speak myself. A large number of my old friends joined me\r\nthere; Lanjuinais, Dufaure, Corcelles, Beaumont and several others sat\r\nnear me.\r\n\r\nLet me say a word concerning the House itself, although everybody knows\r\nit. This is necessary in order to understand the narrative; and,\r\nmoreover, although this monument of wood and plaster is probably\r\ndestined to last longer than the Republic of which it was the cradle, I\r\ndo not think it will enjoy a very long existence; and when it is\r\ndestroyed, many of the events that took place in it will be difficult to\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThe house formed an oblong of great size. At one end, against the wall,\r\nwas the President's platform and the tribune; nine rows of benches rose\r\ngradually along the three other walls. In the middle, facing the\r\ntribune, spread a huge, empty space, like the arena of an amphitheatre,\r\nwith this difference, that this arena was square, not round. The\r\nconsequence was that most of the listeners only caught a side glimpse of\r\nthe speaker, and the only ones who saw him full face were very far away:\r\nan arrangement curiously calculated to promote inattention and disorder.\r\nFor the first, who saw the speaker badly, and were continually looking\r\nat one another, were more engaged in threatening and apostrophizing each\r\nother; and the others did not listen any better, because, although able\r\nto see the occupant of the tribune, they heard him badly.\r\n\r\nLarge windows, placed high up in the walls, opened straight outside, and\r\nadmitted air and light; the walls were decorated only with a few flags;\r\ntime had, luckily, been wanting in which to add to them all those\r\nspiritless allegories on canvas or pasteboard with which the French love\r\nto adorn their monuments, in spite of their being insipid to those who\r\ncan understand them and utterly incomprehensible to the mass of the\r\npeople. The whole bore an aspect of immensity, together with an air that\r\nwas cold, solemn, and almost melancholy. There were seats for nine\r\nhundred members, a larger number than that of any of the assemblies that\r\nhad sat in France for sixty years.\r\n\r\nI felt at once that the atmosphere of this assembly suited me.\r\nNotwithstanding the gravity of events, I experienced there a sense of\r\nwell-being that was new to me. For the first time since I had entered\r\npublic life, I felt myself caught in the current of a majority, and\r\nfollowing in its company the only road which my tastes, my reason and my\r\nconscience pointed out to me: a new and very welcome sensation. I\r\ngathered that this majority would disown the Socialists and the\r\nMontagnards, but was sincere in its desire to maintain and organize the\r\nRepublic. I was with it on these two leading points: I had no monarchic\r\nfaith, no affection nor regrets for any prince; I felt called upon to\r\ndefend no cause save that of liberty and the dignity of mankind. To\r\nprotect the ancient laws of Society against the innovators with the help\r\nof the new force which the republican principle might lend to the\r\ngovernment; to cause the evident will of the French people to triumph\r\nover the passions and desires of the Paris workmen; to conquer\r\ndemagogism by democracy--that was my only aim. I am not sure that the\r\ndangers to be passed through before it could be attained did not make it\r\nstill more attractive to me; for I have a natural inclination for\r\nadventure, and a spice of danger has always seemed to me the best\r\nseasoning that can be given to most of the actions of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n     MY RELATIONS WITH LAMARTINE--HIS SUBTERFUGES\r\n\r\n\r\nLamartine was now at the climax of his fame: to all those whom the\r\nRevolution had injured or alarmed, that is to say, to the great majority\r\nof the nation, he appeared in the light of a saviour. He had been\r\nelected to the Assembly by the city of Paris and no fewer than eleven\r\ndepartments; I do not believe that ever anybody inspired such keen\r\ntransports as those to which he was then giving rise; one must have seen\r\nlove thus stimulated by fear to know with what excess of idolatry men\r\nare capable of loving. The transcendental favour which was shown him at\r\nthis time was not to be compared with anything except, perhaps, the\r\nexcessive injustice which he shortly afterwards received. All the\r\ndeputies who came to Paris with the desire to put down the excesses of\r\nthe Revolution and to combat the demagogic party regarded him beforehand\r\nas their only possible leader, and looked to him unhesitatingly to place\r\nhimself at their head to attack and overthrow the Socialists and\r\ndemagogues. They soon discovered that they were deceived, and that\r\nLamartine did not see the part he was called upon to play in so simple\r\na light. It must be confessed that his was a very complex and difficult\r\nposition. It was forgotten at the time, but he could not himself forget,\r\nthat he had contributed more than any other to the success of the\r\nRevolution of February. Terror effaced this remembrance for the moment\r\nfrom the public mind; but a general feeling of security could not fail\r\nsoon to restore it. It was easy to foresee that, so soon as the current\r\nwhich had brought affairs to their present pitch was arrested, a\r\ncontrary current would set in, which would impel the nation in the\r\nopposite direction, and drive it faster and further than Lamartine could\r\nor would go. The success of the Montagnards would involve his immediate\r\nruin; but their complete defeat would render him useless and must,\r\nsooner or later, remove the government from his hands. He saw,\r\ntherefore, that for him there was almost as much danger and loss in\r\ntriumph as in defeat.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, I believe that, if Lamartine had resolutely, from\r\nthe first, placed himself at the head of the immense party which desired\r\nto moderate and regulate the course of the Revolution, and had succeeded\r\nin leading it to victory, he would before long have been buried beneath\r\nhis own triumph; he would not have been able to stop his army in time,\r\nand it would have left him behind and chosen other leaders.\r\n\r\nI doubt whether, whatever line of conduct he had adopted, he could have\r\nretained his power for long. I believe his only remaining chance was to\r\nbe gloriously defeated while saving his country. But Lamartine was the\r\nlast man to sacrifice himself in this way. I do not know that I have\r\never, in this world of selfishness and ambition in which I lived, met a\r\nmind so void of any thought of the public welfare as his. I have seen a\r\ncrowd of men disturbing the country in order to raise themselves: that\r\nis an everyday perversity; but he is the only one who seemed to me\r\nalways ready to turn the world upside down in order to divert himself.\r\nNeither have I ever known a mind less sincere, nor one that had a more\r\nthorough contempt for the truth. When I say he despised it, I am wrong:\r\nhe did not honour it enough to heed it in any way whatever. When\r\nspeaking or writing, he spoke the truth or lied, without caring which he\r\ndid, occupied only with the effect he wished to produce at the moment.\r\n\r\nI had not seen Lamartine since the 24th of February. I saw him the first\r\ntime on the day before the opening of the Assembly in the new house,\r\nwhere I had gone to choose my seat, but I did not speak to him; he was\r\nsurrounded by some of his new friends. The instant he saw me, he\r\npretended some business at the other end of the house, and hurried away\r\nas fast as he could. He sent me word afterwards by Champeaux (who\r\nbelonged to him, half as a friend and half as a servant) that I must not\r\ntake it ill of him that he avoided me; that his position obliged him to\r\nact in this way towards the members of the late parliament; that my\r\nplace was, of course, marked out among the future leaders of the\r\nRepublic; but that we must wait till the first temporary difficulties\r\nwere surmounted before coming to an agreement. Champeaux also declared\r\nthat he was instructed to ask my opinion on the state of business; I\r\ngave it him very readily, but to very little purpose. This established\r\ncertain indirect relations between Lamartine and myself through the\r\nintermediary of Champeaux. The latter often came to see me, to inform\r\nme, on behalf of his patron, of the arrangements that were being\r\nprepared; and I sometimes went to see him in a little room he had hired\r\non the top floor of a house in the Rue Saint-Honore, where he used to\r\nreceive suspicious visitors, although he had a complete set of rooms at\r\nthe Foreign Office.\r\n\r\nI usually found him overwhelmed with place-hunters; for in France\r\npolitical mendicancy exists under every form of government. It even\r\nincreases through the very revolutions that are directed against it,\r\nbecause all revolutions ruin a certain number of men, and with us a\r\nruined man always looks to the State to repair his fortunes. They were\r\nof all kinds, all attracted by the reflection of power which Lamartine's\r\nfriendship very transiently cast over Champeaux. I remember among others\r\na certain cook, not particularly distinguished in his calling, as far as\r\nI could see, who insisted upon entering the service of Lamartine, who\r\nhad, he said, become President of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\"But he's not President yet!\" cried Champeaux.\r\n\r\n\"If he's not so yet, as you say,\" said the man, \"he's going to be, and\r\nhe must already be thinking of his kitchen.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to rid himself of this scullion's obstinate ambition, Champeaux\r\npromised to bring his name before Lamartine so soon as the latter should\r\nbe President of the Republic. The poor man went away quite satisfied,\r\ndreaming no doubt of the very imaginary splendours of his approaching\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nI frequented Champeaux pretty assiduously during that time, although he\r\nwas exceedingly vain, loquacious, and tedious, because, in talking with\r\nhim, I became better acquainted with Lamartine's thoughts and projects\r\nthan if I had been talking to the great man himself. Lamartine's\r\nintelligence was seen through Champeaux' folly as you see the sun\r\nthrough a smoked glass, which shows you the luminary deprived of its\r\nheat-rays, but less dazzling to the eye. I easily gathered that in this\r\nworld every one was feeding on pretty well the same chimeras as the cook\r\nof whom I have just spoken, and that Lamartine already tasted at the\r\nbottom of his heart the sweets of that sovereign power which was\r\nnevertheless at that very moment escaping from his hands. He was then\r\nfollowing the tortuous road that was so soon to lead him to his ruin,\r\nstruggling to dominate the Mountain without overthrowing it, and to\r\nslacken the revolutionary fire without extinguishing it, so as to give\r\nthe country a feeling of security strong enough for it to bless him, not\r\nstrong enough to cause it to forget him. What he dreaded above all was\r\nthat the conduct of the Assembly should be allowed to fall into the\r\nhands of the former parliamentary leaders. This was, I believe, at the\r\ntime his dominant passion. One could see this during the great\r\ndiscussion on the constitution of the Executive Power; never did the\r\ndifferent parties display more visibly the pedantic hypocrisy which\r\ninduces them to conceal their interests beneath their ideas: an ordinary\r\nspectacle enough, but more striking at this time than usual, because the\r\nneeds of the moment compelled each party to shelter itself behind\r\ntheories which were foreign or even opposed to it. The old royalist\r\nparty maintained that the Assembly itself should govern and choose its\r\nministers: a theory that was almost demagogic; and the demagogues\r\ndeclared that the Executive Power should be entrusted to a permanent\r\ncommission, which should govern and select all the agents of the\r\ngovernment: a system that approached the monarchic idea. All this\r\nverbiage only meant that one side wished to remove Ledru-Rollin from\r\npower, and the other to keep him there.\r\n\r\nThe nation saw in Ledru-Rollin the bloody image of the Terror; it beheld\r\nin him the genius of evil as in Lamartine the genius of good, and it was\r\nmistaken in both cases. Ledru-Rollin was nothing more than a very\r\nsensual and sanguine heavy fellow, quite without principles and almost\r\nwithout brains, possessing no real courage of mind or heart, and even\r\nfree from malice: for he naturally wished well to all the world, and was\r\nincapable of cutting the throats of any one of his adversaries, except,\r\nperhaps, for the sake of historical reminiscences, or to accommodate his\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe result of the debate remained long doubtful: Barrot turned it\r\nagainst us by making a very fine speech in our favour. I have witnessed\r\nmany of these unforeseen incidents in parliamentary life, and have seen\r\nparties constantly deceived in the same way, because they always think\r\nonly of the pleasure they themselves derive from their great orator's\r\nwords, and never of the dangerous excitement he promotes in their\r\nopponents.\r\n\r\nWhen Lamartine, who till then had kept silent and remained, I believe,\r\nin indecision, heard, for the first time since February, the voice of\r\nthe ex-leader of the Left resounding with brilliancy and success, he\r\nsuddenly made up his mind, and spoke. \"You understand,\" said Champeaux\r\nto me the next day, \"that before all it was necessary to prevent the\r\nAssembly from coming to a resolution upon Barrot's advice.\" So Lamartine\r\nspoke, and, according to his custom, spoke in brilliant fashion.\r\n\r\nThe majority, who had already adopted the course that Barrot had urged\r\nupon them, wheeled round as they listened to him (for this Assembly was\r\nmore credulous and more submissive than any that I had ever seen to the\r\nwiles of eloquence: it was novice and innocent enough to seek for\r\nreasons for their decisions in the speeches of the orators). Thus\r\nLamartine won his cause, but missed his fortune; for he that day gave\r\nrise to the mistrust which soon arose and hurled him from his pinnacle\r\nof popularity more quickly than he had mounted it. Suspicion took a\r\ndefinite form the very next day, when he was seen to patronize\r\nLedru-Rollin and force the hand of his own friends in order to induce\r\nthem to appoint the latter as his colleague on the Executive Commission.\r\nAt this sight there arose in the Assembly and in the nation\r\ninexpressible disappointment, terror and rage. For my part, I\r\nexperienced these two last emotions in the highest degree; I clearly\r\nperceived that Lamartine was turning out of the high-road that led us\r\naway from anarchy, and I could not guess into what abyss he might lead\r\nus if we followed the byways which he was treading. How was it possible,\r\nindeed, to foresee how far an always exuberant imagination might go,\r\nunrestrained by reason or virtue? Lamartine's common-sense impressed me\r\nno more than did his disinterestedness; and, in fact, I believed him\r\ncapable of everything except cowardly behaviour or vulgar oratory.\r\n\r\nI confess that the events of June to a certain extent modified the\r\nopinion I had formed of his manner of proceeding. They showed that our\r\nadversaries were more numerous, better organized and, above all, more\r\ndetermined than I had thought.\r\n\r\nLamartine, who had seen nothing but Paris during the last two months,\r\nand who had there, so to speak, lived in the very heart of the\r\nrevolutionary party, exaggerated the power of the Capital and the\r\ninactivity of the rest of France. He over-estimated both. But I am not\r\nsure that I, on my side, did not strain a point on the other side. The\r\nroad we ought to follow seemed to me so clearly and visibly traced that\r\nI would not admit the possibility of deviating from it by mistake; it\r\nseemed obvious to me that we should hasten to profit by the moral force\r\npossessed by the Assembly in order to escape from the hands of the\r\npeople, seize upon the government, and by a great effort establish it\r\nupon a solid basis. Every delay seemed to me calculated to diminish our\r\npower, and to strengthen the hand of our adversaries.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, during the six months that elapsed between the opening\r\nof the Assembly and the events of June that the Paris workmen grew bold,\r\nand took courage to resist, organized themselves, procured both arms and\r\nammunition, and made their final preparations for the struggle. In any\r\ncase, I am led to believe that it was Lamartine's tergiversations and\r\nhis semi-connivance with the enemy that saved us, while it ruined him.\r\nTheir effect was to amuse the leaders of the Mountain, and to divide\r\nthem. The Montagnards of the old school, who were retained in the\r\nGovernment, separated themselves from the Socialists, who were excluded\r\nfrom it. Had all been united by a common interest, and impelled by\r\ncommon despair before our victory, as they became since, it is doubtful\r\nwhether that victory would have been won. When I consider that we were\r\nalmost effaced, although we were opposed only by the revolutionary party\r\nwithout its leaders, I ask myself what the result of the contest would\r\nhave been if those leaders had come forward, and if the insurrection had\r\nbeen supported by a third of the National Assembly.\r\n\r\nLamartine saw these dangers more closely and clearly than I, and I\r\nbelieve to-day that the fear of arousing a mortal conflict influenced\r\nhis conduct as much as did his ambition. I might have formed this\r\nopinion at the time had I listened to Madame de Lamartine, whose alarm\r\nfor the safety of her husband, and even of the Assembly, amounted to\r\nextravagance. \"Beware,\" she said to me, each time she met me, \"beware of\r\npushing things to extremes; you do not know the strength of the\r\nrevolutionary party. If we enter into conflict with it, we shall\r\nperish.\" I have often reproached myself for not cultivating Madame de\r\nLamartine's acquaintance, for I have always found her to possess real\r\nvirtue, although she added to it almost all the faults which can cling\r\nto virtue, and which, without impairing it, render it less lovable: an\r\nimperious temper, great personal pride, an upright but unyielding, and\r\nsometimes bitter, spirit; so much so that it was impossible not to\r\nrespect her, and impossible to like her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n     THE 15TH OF MAY 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary party had not dared to oppose the meeting of the\r\nAssembly, but it refused to be dominated by it. On the contrary, it well\r\nunderstood how to keep the Assembly in subjection, and to obtain from it\r\nby constraint what it refused to grant from sympathy. Already the clubs\r\nrang with threats and insults against the deputies. And as the French,\r\nin their political passions, are as argumentative as they are insensible\r\nto argument, these popular meeting-places were incessantly occupied in\r\nmanufacturing theories that formed the ground-work of subsequent acts of\r\nviolence. It was held that the people always remained superior to its\r\nrepresentatives, and never completely surrendered its will into their\r\nhands: a true principle from which the false conclusion was drawn that\r\nthe Paris workmen were the French people. Since our first sitting, a\r\nvague and widespread agitation had never ceased to reign in the town.\r\nThe mob met every day in the streets and squares; it spread aimlessly,\r\nlike the swell of the waves. The approaches to the Assembly were always\r\nfilled with a gathering of these redoubtable idlers. A demagogic party\r\nhas so many heads, chance always plays so great, and reason so small, a\r\npart in its actions that it is almost impossible to say, either before\r\nor after the event, what it wants or what it wanted. Nevertheless, my\r\nopinion then was, and has since remained, that the leading demagogues\r\ndid not aim at destroying the Assembly, and that, as yet, they only\r\nsought to make use of it by mastering it. The attack directed against it\r\non the 15th of May seemed intended rather to frighten than to overthrow\r\nit; it was at least one of those equivocal enterprises which so\r\nfrequently occur in times of popular excitement, in which the promoters\r\nthemselves are careful not to trace or define precisely their plan or\r\ntheir aim, so as to remain free to limit themselves to a peaceful\r\ndemonstration or force on a revolution, according to the incidents of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nSome attempt of this kind had been expected for over a week; but the\r\nhabit of living in a continual state of alarm ends in rendering both\r\nindividuals and assemblies incapable of discerning, amid the signs\r\nannouncing the approach of danger, that which immediately precedes it.\r\nWe only knew that there was a question of a great popular demonstration\r\nin favour of Poland, and we were but vaguely disturbed at it. Doubtless\r\nthe members of the Government were better informed and more alarmed than\r\nwe, but they kept their own counsel, and I was not sufficiently in touch\r\nwith them to penetrate into their secret thoughts.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that, on the 15th of May, I reached the Assembly\r\nwithout foreseeing what was going to happen. The sitting began as any\r\nother sitting might have begun; and what was very strange, twenty\r\nthousand men already surrounded the chamber, without a single sound from\r\nthe outside having announced their presence. Wolowski was in the\r\ntribune: he was mumbling between his teeth I know not what commonplaces\r\nabout Poland, when the mob at last betrayed its approach with a terrible\r\nshout, which penetrated from every side through the upper windows, left\r\nopen because of the heat, and fell upon us as though from the sky. Never\r\nhad I imagined that a number of human voices could together produce so\r\nimmense a volume of sound, and the sight of the crowd itself, when it\r\nsurged into the Assembly, did not seem to me so formidable as that first\r\nroar which it had uttered before showing itself. Many members, yielding\r\nto a first impulse of curiosity or fear, sprang to their feet; others\r\nshouted violently, \"Keep your seats!\" Everyone sat down again firmly on\r\nhis bench, and kept silence. Wolowski resumed his speech, and continued\r\nit for some time. It must have been the first time in his life that he\r\nwas listened to in silence; and even now it was not he to whom we\r\nlistened, but the crowd outside, whose murmurs grew momentarily louder\r\nand nearer.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Degousee, one of our questors, solemnly mounted the steps of\r\nthe tribune, silently pushed Wolowski aside, and said, \"Contrary to the\r\nwishes of the questors, General Courtais has ordered the Gardes Mobiles\r\nguarding the doors of the Assembly to sheathe their bayonets.\"\r\n\r\nAfter uttering these few words he stopped. This Degousee, who was a very\r\ngood man, had the most hang-dog look and the hollowest voice imaginable.\r\nThe news, the man and the voice combined to create a curious impression.\r\nThe Assembly was roused, but immediately grew calm again; it was too\r\nlate to do anything: the chamber was forced.\r\n\r\nLamartine, who had gone out at the first noise, returned to the door\r\nwith a disconcerted air; he crossed the central gangway and regained his\r\nseat with great strides, as though pursued by some enemy invisible to\r\nus. Almost immediately, there appeared behind him a number of men of the\r\npeople, who stopped still on the threshold, surprised at the sight of\r\nthis immense seated assembly. At the same moment, as on the 24th of\r\nFebruary, the galleries were noisily opened and invaded by a flood of\r\npeople, who filled and more than filled them. Pressed forward by the mob\r\nwho followed and pushed them without seeing them, the first comers\r\nclimbed over the balustrades of the galleries, trusting to find room in\r\nthe Chamber itself, the floor of which was not more than ten feet\r\nbeneath them, hung down along the walls, and dropped the distance of\r\nfour or five feet into the Chamber. The fall of each of these bodies\r\nstriking the floor in succession produced a dull concussion which at\r\nfirst, amid the tumult, I took for the distant sound of cannon. While\r\none part of the mob was thus falling into the house, the other, composed\r\nprincipally of the club-leaders, entered by every door. They carried\r\nvarious emblems of the Terror, and waved flags of which some were\r\nsurmounted by a red cap.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the mob had filled the large empty space in the centre of\r\nthe Assembly; and finding itself pressed for room, it climbed all the\r\nlittle gangways leading to our benches, and crowded more and more into\r\nthese narrow spaces without ceasing its agitation. Amid this tumultuous\r\nand incessant commotion, the dust became very thick and the heat so\r\noppressive that perhaps I would have gone out to breathe some fresh air,\r\nhad it been merely a question of the public interest. But honour kept us\r\nglued to our seats.\r\n\r\nSome of the intruders were openly armed, others showed glimpses of\r\nconcealed weapons, but none seemed to entertain a fixed intention of\r\nstriking us. Their expression was one of astonishment and ill-will\r\nrather than enmity; with many of them a sort of vulgar curiosity in\r\ncourse of gratifying itself seemed to dominate every other sentiment;\r\nfor even in our most sanguinary insurrections there are always a number\r\nof people half scoundrels, half sight-seers, who fancy themselves at the\r\nplay. Moreover, there was no common leader whom they seemed to obey; it\r\nwas a mob of men, not a troop. I saw some drunken men among them, but\r\nthe majority seemed to be the prey of a feverish excitement imparted to\r\nthem by the enthusiasm and shouting without and the stifling heat, the\r\nclose packing and general discomfort within. They dripped with sweat,\r\nalthough the nature and condition of their clothing was not calculated\r\nto make the heat very uncomfortable for them, for several were quite\r\nbare-breasted. There rose from this multitude a confused noise from the\r\nmidst of which one sometimes heard very threatening observations. I\r\ncaught sight of men who shook their fists at us and called us their\r\nagents. This expression was often repeated; for several days the\r\nultra-democratic newspapers had done nothing but call the\r\nrepresentatives the agents of the people, and these blackguards had\r\ntaken kindly to the idea. A moment after, I had an opportunity of\r\nobserving with what vivacity and clearness the popular mind receives and\r\nreflects images. I heard a man in a blouse, standing next to me, say to\r\nhis fellow, \"See that vulture down there? I should like to twist its\r\nneck.\" I followed the movement of his arm and his eyes and saw without\r\ndifficulty that he was speaking of Lacordaire, who was sitting in his\r\nDominican's frock on the top bench of the Left. The sentiment struck me\r\nas very unhandsome, but the comparison was admirable; the priest's long,\r\nbony neck issuing from its white cowl, his bald head surrounded only\r\nwith a tuft of black hair, his narrow face, his hooked nose and his\r\nfixed, glittering eyes really gave him a striking resemblance to the\r\nbird of prey in question.\r\n\r\nDuring all this disorder in its midst, the Assembly sat passive and\r\nmotionless on its benches, neither resisting nor giving way, silent and\r\nfirm. A few members of the Mountain fraternized with the mob, but\r\nstealthily and in whispers. Raspail had taken possession of the tribune\r\nand was preparing to read the petition of the clubs; a young deputy,\r\nd'Adelsward, rose and exclaimed, \"By what right does Citizen Raspail\r\nclaim to speak here?\" A furious howling arose; some men of the people\r\nmade a rush at d'Adelsward, but were stopped and held back. With great\r\ndifficulty, Raspail obtained a moment's silence from his friends, and\r\nread the petition, or rather the orders, of the clubs, which enjoined us\r\nto pronounce forthwith in favour of Poland.\r\n\r\n\"No delay, we're waiting for the answer!\" was shouted on every side. The\r\nAssembly continued to give no sign of life; the mob, in its disorder and\r\nimpatience, made a horrible noise, which by itself alone saved us from\r\nmaking a reply. Buchez, the President, whom some would make out to be a\r\nrascal and others a saint, but who undoubtedly, on that day, was a great\r\nblockhead, rang his bell with all his might to obtain silence, as though\r\nthe silence of that multitude was not, under the present circumstances,\r\nmore to be dreaded than its cries.\r\n\r\nIt was then that I saw appear, in his turn, in the tribune a man whom I\r\nhave never seen since, but the recollection of whom has always filled me\r\nwith horror and disgust. He had wan, emaciated cheeks, white lips, a\r\nsickly, wicked and repulsive expression, a dirty pallor, the appearance\r\nof a mouldy corpse; he wore no visible linen; an old black frock-coat\r\ntightly covered his lean, withered limbs; he seemed to have passed his\r\nlife in a sewer, and to have just left it. I was told it was Blanqui.[9]\r\n\r\n     [9: Auguste Blanqui, brother to Jerome Adolphe Blanqui the\r\n     economist.--A.T. de M.]\r\n\r\nBlanqui said one word about Poland; then, turning sharply to domestic\r\naffairs, he asked for revenge for what he called the massacres of Rouen,\r\nrecalled with threats the wretchedness in which the people had been\r\nleft, and complained of the wrongs done to the latter by the Assembly.\r\nAfter thus exciting his hearers, he returned to Poland and, like\r\nRaspail, demanded an immediate vote.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly continued to sit motionless, the people to move about and\r\nutter a thousand contradictory exclamations, the President to ring his\r\nbell. Ledru-Rollin tried to persuade the mob to withdraw, but nobody was\r\nnow able to exercise any influence over it. Ledru-Rollin, almost hooted,\r\nleft the tribune.\r\n\r\nThe tumult was renewed, increased, multiplied itself as it were, for the\r\nmob was no longer sufficiently master of itself to be able even to\r\nunderstand the necessity for a moment's self-restraint in order to\r\nattain the object of its passion. A long interval passed; at last Barbes\r\ndarted up and climbed, or rather leapt, into the tribune. He was one of\r\nthose men in whom the demagogue, the madman and the knight-errant are so\r\nclosely intermingled that it is not possible to say where one ends or\r\nthe other commences, and who can only make their way in a society as\r\nsick and troubled as ours. I am inclined to believe that it was the\r\nmadman that predominated in him, and his madness became raging when he\r\nheard the voice of the people. His soul boiled as naturally amid popular\r\npassion as water does on the fire. Since our invasion by the mob, I had\r\nnot taken my eyes from him; I considered him by far the most formidable\r\nof our adversaries, because he was the most insane, the most\r\ndisinterested, and the most resolute of them all. I had seen him mount\r\nthe platform on which the President sat, and stand for a long time\r\nmotionless, only turning his agitated gaze about the Assembly; I had\r\nobserved and pointed out to my neighbours the distortion of his\r\nfeatures, his livid pallor, the convulsive excitement which caused him\r\neach moment to twist his moustache between his fingers; he stood there\r\nas the image of irresolution, leaning already towards an extreme side.\r\nThis time, Barbes had made up his mind; he proposed in some way to sum\r\nup the passions of the people, and to make sure of victory by stating\r\nits object in terms of precision:\r\n\r\n\"I demand,\" said he, in panting, jerking tones, \"that, immediately and\r\nbefore rising, the Assembly shall vote the departure of an army for\r\nPoland, a tax of a milliard upon the rich, the removal of the troops\r\nfrom Paris, and shall forbid the beating to arms; if not, the\r\nrepresentatives to be declared traitors to the country.\"\r\n\r\nI believe we should have been lost if Barbes had succeeded in getting\r\nhis motion put to the vote; for if the Assembly had accepted it, it\r\nwould have been dishonoured and powerless, whereas, if it had rejected\r\nit, which was probable, we should have run the risk of having our\r\nthroats cut. But Barbes himself did not succeed in obtaining a brief\r\nspace of silence so as to compel us to take a decision. The huge clamour\r\nthat followed his last words was not to be appeased; on the contrary, it\r\ncontinued in a thousand varied intonations. Barbes exhausted himself in\r\nhis efforts to still it, but in vain, although he was powerfully aided\r\nby the President's bell, which, during all this time, never ceased to\r\nsound, like a knell.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary sitting had lasted since two o'clock; the Assembly\r\nheld out, its ears pricked up to catch any sound from the outside,\r\nwaiting for assistance to come. But Paris seemed a dead city. Listen as\r\nwe might, we heard no rumour issue from it.\r\n\r\nThis passive resistance irritated and incensed the people; it was like a\r\ncold, even surface upon which its fury glided without knowing what to\r\ncatch hold of; it struggled and writhed in vain, without finding any\r\nissue to its undertaking. A thousand diverse and contradictory clamours\r\nfilled the air: \"Let us go away,\" cried some.... \"The organization of\r\nlabour.... A ministry of labour.... A tax on the rich.... We want Louis\r\nBlanc!\" cried others; they ended by fighting at the foot of the tribune\r\nto decide who should mount it; five or six orators occupied it at once,\r\nand often all spoke together. As always happens in insurrections, the\r\nterrible was mingled with the ridiculous. The heat was so stifling that\r\nmany of the first intruders left the Chamber; they were forthwith\r\nreplaced by others who had been waiting at the doors to come in. In this\r\nway I saw a fireman in uniform making his way down the gangway that\r\npassed along my bench. \"We can't make them vote!\" they shouted to him.\r\n\"Wait, wait,\" he replied, \"I'll see to it, I'll give them a piece of my\r\nmind.\" Thereupon he pulled his helmet over his eyes with a determined\r\nair, fastened the straps, squeezed through the crowd, pushing aside all\r\nwho stood in his way, and mounted the tribune. He imagined he would be\r\nas much at his ease there as upon a roof, but he could not find his\r\nwords and stopped short. The people cried, \"Speak up, fireman!\" but he\r\ndid not speak a word, and they ended by turning him out of the tribune.\r\nJust then a number of men of the people caught Louis Blanc in their arms\r\nand carried him in triumph round the Chamber. They held him by his\r\nlittle legs above their heads; I saw him make vain efforts to extricate\r\nhimself: he twisted and turned on every side without succeeding in\r\nescaping from their hands, talking all the while in a choking, strident\r\nvoice. He reminded me of a snake having its tail pinched. They put him\r\ndown at last on a bench beneath mine. I heard him cry, \"My friends, the\r\nright you have just won....\" but the remainder of his words were lost in\r\nthe din. I was told that Sobrier was carried in the same way a little\r\nlower down.\r\n\r\nA very tragic incident nearly put an end to these saturnalia: the\r\nbenches at the bottom of the house suddenly cracked, gave way more than\r\na foot, and threatened to hurl into the Chamber the crowd which\r\noverloaded it, and which fled off in affright. This alarming occurrence\r\nput a momentary stop to the commotion; and I then first heard, in the\r\ndistance, the sound of drums beating the call to arms in Paris. The mob\r\nheard it too, and uttered a long yell of rage and terror. \"Why are they\r\nbeating to arms?\" exclaimed Barbes, beside himself, making his way to\r\nthe tribune afresh. \"Who is beating to arms? Let those who have given\r\nthe order be outlawed!\" Cries of \"We are betrayed, to arms! To the Hotel\r\nde Ville!\" rose from the crowd.\r\n\r\nThe President was driven from his chair, whence, if we are to believe\r\nthe version he since gave, he caused himself to be driven voluntarily. A\r\nclub-leader called Huber climbed to his seat and hoisted a flag\r\nsurmounted by a red cap. The man had, it seemed, just recovered from a\r\nlong epileptic swoon, caused doubtless by the excitement and the heat;\r\nit was on recovering from this sort of troubled sleep that he came\r\nforward. His clothes were still in disorder, his look scared and\r\nhaggard. He exclaimed twice over in a resounding voice, which, uttered\r\nfrom aloft, filled the house and dominated every other sound, \"In the\r\nname of the people, betrayed by its representatives, I declare the\r\nNational Assembly dissolved!\"\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, deprived of its President, broke up. Barbes and the bolder\r\nof the club politicians went out to go to the Hotel de Ville. This\r\nconclusion to the affair was far from meeting the general wishes. I\r\nheard men of the people beside me say to each other, in an aggrieved\r\ntone, \"No, no, that's not what we want.\" Many sincere Republicans were\r\nin despair. I was first accosted, amid this tumult, by Tretat, a\r\nrevolutionary of the sentimental kind, a dreamer who had plotted in\r\nfavour of the Republic during the whole existence of the Monarchy.\r\nMoreover, he was a physician of distinction, who was at that time at the\r\nhead of one of the principal mad-houses in Paris, although he was a\r\nlittle cracked himself. He took my hands effusively, and with tears in\r\nhis eyes:\r\n\r\n\"Ah, monsieur,\" he said, \"what a misfortune, and how strange it is to\r\nthink that it is madmen, real madmen, who have brought this about! I\r\nhave treated or prescribed for each one of them. Blanqui is a madman,\r\nBarbes is a madman, Sobrier is a madman, Huber is the greatest madman of\r\nthem all: they are all madmen, monsieur, who ought to be locked up at my\r\nSalpetriere instead of being here.\"\r\n\r\nHe would certainly have added his own name to the list, had he known\r\nhimself as well as he knew his old friends. I have always thought that\r\nin revolutions, especially democratic revolutions, madmen, not those so\r\ncalled by courtesy, but genuine madmen, have played a very considerable\r\npolitical part. One thing at least is certain, and that is that a\r\ncondition of semi-madness is not unbecoming at such times, and often\r\neven leads to success.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly had dispersed, but it will be readily believed that it did\r\nnot consider itself dissolved. Nor did it even regard itself as\r\ndefeated. The majority of the members who left the House did so with the\r\nfirm intention of soon meeting again elsewhere; they said so to one\r\nanother, and I am convinced that they were, in fact, quite resolved upon\r\nit. As for myself, I decided to stay behind, kept back partly by the\r\nfeeling of curiosity that irresistibly retains me in places where\r\nanything uncommon is proceeding, and partly by the opinion which I held\r\nthen, as I did on the 24th of February, that the strength of an assembly\r\nin a measure resides in the hall it occupies. I therefore remained and\r\nwitnessed the grotesque and disorderly, but meaningless and\r\nuninteresting, scenes that followed. The mob set itself, amid a\r\nthousand disorders and a thousand cries, to form a Provisional\r\nGovernment. It was a parody of the 24th of February, just as the 24th of\r\nFebruary was a parody of other revolutionary scenes. This had lasted\r\nsome time, when I thought that among all the noise I heard an irregular\r\nsound coming from the outside of the Palace. I have a very quick ear,\r\nand I was not slow in distinguishing the sound of a drum approaching and\r\nbeating the charge; for in our days of civil disorder, everyone has\r\nlearnt to know the language of these warlike instruments. I at once\r\nhurried to the door by which these new arrivals would enter.\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, a drum preceding some forty Gardes Mobiles. These lads\r\npierced through the crowd with a certain air of resolution, although one\r\ncould not clearly say at first what they proposed to do. Soon they\r\ndisappeared from sight and remained as though submerged; but a short\r\ndistance behind them marched a compact column of National Guards, who\r\nrushed into the House with significant shouts of \"Long live the National\r\nAssembly!\" I stuck my card of membership in my hat-band and entered with\r\nthem. They first cleared the platform of five or six orators, who were\r\nat that moment speaking at once, and flung them, with none too great\r\nceremony, down the steps of the little staircase that leads to it. At\r\nthe sight of this, the insurgents at first made as though to resist; but\r\na panic seized them. Climbing over the empty benches, tumbling over one\r\nanother in the gangways, they made for the outer lobbies and sprang into\r\nthe court-yards from every window. In a few minutes there remained only\r\nthe National Guards, whose cries of \"Long live the National Assembly\"\r\nshook the walls of the Chamber.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly itself was absent; but little by little the members who had\r\ndispersed in the neighbourhood hastened up. They shook the hands of the\r\nNational Guards, embraced each other, and regained their seats. The\r\nNational Guards cried, \"Long live the National Assembly!\" and the\r\nmembers, \"Long live the National Guard! and long live the Republic!\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the hall recaptured, than General Courtais, the original\r\nauthor of our danger, had the incomparable impudence to present himself;\r\nthe National Guards received him with yells of fury; he was seized and\r\ndragged to the foot of the rostrum. I saw him pass before my eyes, pale\r\nas a dying man among the flashing swords: thinking they would cut his\r\nthroat, I cried with all my might, \"Tear off his epaulettes, but don't\r\nkill him!\" which was done.\r\n\r\nThen Lamartine reappeared. I never learnt how he had employed his time\r\nduring the three hours wherein we were invaded. I had caught sight of\r\nhim during the first hour: he was seated at that moment on a bench below\r\nmine, and he was combing his hair, glued together with perspiration,\r\nwith a little comb he drew from his pocket; the crowd formed again and\r\nI saw him no more. Apparently he went to the inner rooms of the Palace,\r\ninto which the mob had also penetrated, with the intention of haranguing\r\nit, and was very badly received. I was given, on the next day, some\r\ncurious details of this scene, which I would have related here if I had\r\nnot resolved to set down only what I have myself observed. They say\r\nthat, subsequently, he withdrew to the palace then being built, close at\r\nhand, and destined for the Foreign Office. He would certainly have done\r\nbetter had he placed himself at the head of the National Guards and come\r\nto our release. I think he must have been seized with the faintness of\r\nheart that overcomes the bravest (and he was one of these) when\r\npossessed of a restless and lively imagination.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the Chamber, he had recovered his energy and his\r\neloquence. He told us that his place was not in the Assembly, but in the\r\nstreets, and that he was going to march upon the Hotel de Ville and\r\ncrush the insurrection. This was the last time I heard him\r\nenthusiastically cheered. True, it was not he alone that they applauded,\r\nbut the victory: those cheers and clappings were but an echo of the\r\ntumultuous passions that still agitated every breast. Lamartine went\r\nout. The drums, which had beat the charge half-an-hour before, now beat\r\nthe march. The National Guards and the Gardes Mobiles, who were still\r\nwith us in crowds, formed themselves into order and followed him. The\r\nAssembly, still very incomplete, resumed its sitting; it was six\r\no'clock.\r\n\r\nI went home an instant to take some food; I then returned to the\r\nAssembly, which had declared its sitting permanent. We soon learnt that\r\nthe members of the new Provisional Government had been arrested. Barbes\r\nwas impeached, as was that old fool of a Courtais, who deserved a sound\r\nthrashing and no more. Many wished to include Louis Blanc, who, however,\r\nhad pluckily undertaken to defend himself; he had just escaped with\r\ndifficulty from the fury of the National Guards at the door, and still\r\nwore his torn clothes, covered with dust and all disordered. This time\r\nhe did not send for the stool on which he used to climb in order to\r\nbring his head above the level of the rostrum balustrade (for he was\r\nalmost a dwarf); he even forgot the effect he wished to produce, and\r\nthought only of what he had to say. In spite of that, or rather because\r\nof that, he won his case for the moment. I never considered him to\r\npossess talent except on that one day; for I do not call talent the art\r\nof polishing brilliant and hollow phrases, which are like finely chased\r\ndishes containing nothing.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, I was so fatigued by the excitement of the day that I have\r\nretained but a dull, indistinct remembrance of the night sitting. I\r\nshall therefore say no more, for I wish only to record my personal\r\nimpressions: for facts in detail it is the _Moniteur_, not I, that\r\nshould be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n     THE FEAST OF CONCORD AND THE PREPARATIONS FOR THE DAYS OF JUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe revolutionaries of 1848, unwilling or unable to imitate the\r\nbloodthirsty follies of their predecessors, consoled themselves by\r\nimitating their ludicrous follies. They took it into their heads to give\r\nthe people a series of grand allegorical festivals.\r\n\r\nDespite the terrible condition of the finances, the Provisional\r\nGovernment had decided that a sum of one or two millions should be spent\r\nupon celebrating the Feast of Concord in the Champ-de-Mars.\r\n\r\nAccording to the programme, which was published in advance and\r\nfaithfully followed out, the Champ-de-Mars was to be filled with figures\r\nrepresenting all sorts of persons, virtues, political institutions, and\r\neven public services. France, Germany and Italy, hand in hand; Equality,\r\nLiberty and Fraternity, also hand in hand; Agriculture, Commerce, the\r\nArmy, the Navy and, above all, the Republic; the last of colossal\r\ndimensions. A car was to be drawn by sixteen plough-horses: \"this car,\"\r\nsaid the programme aforesaid, \"will be of a simple and rustic shape, and\r\nwill carry three trees, an oak, a laurel, and an olive tree,\r\nsymbolizing strength, honour, and plenty; and, moreover, a plough in the\r\nmidst of a group of flowers and ears of corn. Ploughmen and young girls\r\ndressed in white will surround the car, singing patriotic hymns.\" We\r\nwere also promised oxen with gilded horns, but did not get them.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly had not the smallest desire to see all these\r\nbeautiful things; it even feared lest the immense gathering of people\r\nwhich was sure to be occasioned should produce some dangerous riot.\r\nAccordingly, it put the date as far back as possible; but the\r\npreparations were made, there was no possibility of going back from it,\r\nand the date was fixed for the 21st of May.\r\n\r\nOn that day I went early to the Assembly, which was to proceed on foot,\r\nin a body, to the Champ-de-Mars. I had put my pistols in my pockets, and\r\nin talking to my colleagues I discovered that most of them were secretly\r\narmed, like myself: one had taken a sword-stick, another a dagger;\r\nnearly all carried some weapon of defence. Edmond de La Fayette showed\r\nme a weapon of a peculiar kind. It was a ball of lead sewn into a short\r\nleathern thong which could easily be fastened to the arm: one might have\r\ncalled it a portable club. La Fayette declared that this little\r\ninstrument was being widely carried by the National Assembly, especially\r\nsince the 15th of May. It was thus that we proceeded to this Feast of\r\nConcord.\r\n\r\nA sinister rumour ran that some great danger awaited the Assembly when\r\nit should cross through the crowd of the Champ-de-Mars and take up its\r\nplace on the stage reserved for it outside the Military College. As a\r\nmatter of fact, nothing could have been easier than to make it the\r\nobject of an unexpected attack during this progress, which it made on\r\nfoot and, so to speak, unguarded. Its real safeguard lay in the\r\nrecollection of the 15th of May, and that sufficed. It very rarely\r\nhappens, whatever opportunity may present itself, that a body is\r\naffronted the day after its triumph. Moreover, the French never do two\r\nthings at a time. Their minds often change their object, but they are\r\nalways devoted wholly to that occupying them at the moment, and I\r\nbelieve there is no precedent of their making an insurrection in the\r\nmiddle of a fete or even of a ceremony. On this day, therefore, the\r\npeople seemed to enter willingly into the fictitious idea of its\r\nhappiness, and for a moment to place on one side the recollection of its\r\nmiseries and its hatreds. It was animated, without being turbulent. The\r\nprogramme had stated that a \"fraternal confusion\" was to prevail. There\r\nwas, it is true, extreme confusion, but no disorder; for we are strange\r\npeople: we cannot do without the police when we are orderly, and so soon\r\nas we start a revolution, the police seem superfluous. The sight of this\r\npopular joyfulness enraptured the moderate and sincere Republicans, and\r\nmade them almost maudlin. Carnot observed to me, with that silliness\r\nwhich the honest democrat always mingles with his virtue:\r\n\r\n\"Believe me, my dear colleague, one should always trust the people.\"\r\n\r\nI remember rather brusquely replying, \"Ah! why didn't you tell me that\r\nbefore the 15th?\"\r\n\r\nThe Executive Commission occupied one half of the immense stage that had\r\nbeen erected along the Military College, and the National Assembly the\r\nother. There first defiled past us the different emblems of all nations,\r\nwhich took an enormous time, because of the fraternal confusion of which\r\nthe programme spoke. Then came the car, and then the young girls dressed\r\nin white. There were at least three hundred of them, who wore their\r\nvirginal costume in so virile a fashion that they might have been taken\r\nfor boys dressed up as girls. Each had been given a big bouquet to\r\ncarry, which they were so gallant as to throw to us as they passed. As\r\nthese gossips were the owners of very nervous arms, and were more\r\naccustomed, I should think, to using the laundress's beetle than to\r\nstrewing flowers, the bouquets fell down upon us in a very hard and\r\nuncomfortable hail-storm.\r\n\r\nOne tall girl left her companions and, stopping in front of Lamartine,\r\nrecited an ode to his glory. Gradually she grew excited in talking, so\r\nmuch so that she pulled a terrible face and began to make the most\r\nalarming contortions. Never had enthusiasm seemed to me to come so near\r\nto epilepsy. When she had finished, the people insisted at all costs\r\nthat Lamartine should kiss her; she offered him two fat cheeks,\r\nstreaming with perspiration, which he touched with the tip of his lips\r\nand with indifferent bad grace.\r\n\r\nThe only serious portion of the fete was the review. I have never seen\r\nso many armed men in one spot in my life, and I believe that few have\r\nseen more. Apart from the innumerable crowd of sight-seers in the\r\nChamp-de-Mars, one saw an entire people under arms. The _Moniteur_\r\nestimated the number of National Guards and soldiers of the line who\r\nwere there at three hundred thousand. This seemed to me to be\r\nexaggerated, but I do not think that the number could be reduced to less\r\nthan two hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nThe spectacle of those two hundred thousand bayonets will never leave my\r\nmemory. As the men who carried them were tightly pressed against one\r\nanother, so as to be able to keep within the slopes of the\r\nChamp-de-Mars, and as we, from our but slightly raised position, could\r\nonly throw an almost horizontal glance upon them, they formed, to our\r\neyes, a flat and lightly undulating surface, which flashed in the sun\r\nand made the Champ-de-Mars resemble a great lake filled with liquid\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nAll these men marched past us in succession, and we noticed that this\r\narmy numbered many more muskets than uniforms. Only the legions from the\r\nwealthier parts of the town presented a large number of National Guards\r\nclad in military uniform. They were the first to appear, and shouted,\r\n\"Long live the National Assembly!\" with much enthusiasm. In the legions\r\nfrom the suburbs, which formed in themselves veritable armies, one saw\r\nlittle but jackets and blouses, though this did not prevent them from\r\nmarching with a very warlike aspect. Most of them, as they passed us,\r\nwere content to shout, \"Long live the Democratic Republic!\" or to sing\r\nthe _Marseillaise_ or the song of the _Girondins_. Next came the legions\r\nof the outskirts, composed of peasants, badly equipped, badly armed, and\r\ndressed in blouses like the workmen of the suburbs, but filled with a\r\nvery different spirit to that of the latter, as they showed by their\r\ncries and gestures. The battalions of the Garde Mobile uttered various\r\nexclamations, which left us full of doubt and anxiety as to the\r\nintention of these lads, or rather children, who at that time more than\r\nany other held our destinies in their hands.\r\n\r\nThe regiments of the line, who closed the review, marched past in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nI witnessed this long parade with a heart filled with sadness. Never at\r\nany time had so many arms been placed at once into the hands of the\r\npeople. It will be easily believed that I shared neither the simple\r\nconfidence nor the stupid happiness of my friend Carnot; I foresaw, on\r\nthe contrary, that all the bayonets I saw glittering in the sun would\r\nsoon be raised against each other, and I felt that I was at a review of\r\nthe two armies of the civil war that was just concluded. In the course\r\nof that day I still heard frequent shouts of \"Long live Lamartine!\"\r\nalthough his great popularity was already waning. In fact, one might say\r\nit was over, were it not that in every crowd one meets with a large\r\nnumber of belated individuals who are stirred with the enthusiasm of\r\nyesterday, like the provincials who begin to adopt the Paris mode on the\r\nday when the Parisians abandon it.\r\n\r\nLamartine hastened to withdraw from this last ray of his sun: he retired\r\nlong before the ceremony was finished. He looked weary and care-worn.\r\nMany members of the Assembly, also overcome with fatigue, followed his\r\nexample, and the review ended in front of almost empty benches. It had\r\nbegun early and ended at night-fall.\r\n\r\nThe whole time elapsing between the review of the 21st of May and the\r\ndays of June was filled with the anxiety caused by the approach of these\r\nlatter days. Every day fresh alarms came and called out the army and the\r\nNational Guard; the artisans and shopkeepers no longer lived at home,\r\nbut in the public places and under arms. Each one fervently desired to\r\navoid the necessity of a conflict, and all vaguely felt that this\r\nnecessity was becoming more inevitable from day to day. The National\r\nAssembly was so constantly possessed by this thought that one might have\r\nsaid that it read the words \"Civil War\" written on the four walls of the\r\nHouse.\r\n\r\nOn all sides great efforts of prudence and patience were being made to\r\nprevent, or at least delay, the crisis. Members who in their hearts were\r\nmost hostile to the revolution were careful to restrain any expressions\r\nof sympathy or antipathy; the old parliamentary orators were silent,\r\nlest the sound of their voices should give umbrage; they left the\r\nrostrum to the new-comers, who themselves but rarely occupied it, for\r\nthe great debates had ceased. As is common in all assemblies, that which\r\nmost disturbed the members' minds was that of which they spoke least,\r\nthough it was proved that each day they thought of it. All sorts of\r\nmeasures to help the misery of the people were proposed and discussed.\r\nWe even entered readily into an examination of the different socialistic\r\nsystems, and each strove in all good faith to discover in these\r\nsomething applicable to, or at least compatible with, the ancient laws\r\nof Society.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, the national workshops continued to fill; their\r\npopulation already exceeded one hundred thousand men. It was felt that\r\nwe could not live if they were kept on, and it was feared that we should\r\nperish if we tried to dismiss them. This burning question of the\r\nnational workshops was treated daily, but superficially and timidly; it\r\nwas constantly touched upon, but never firmly taken in hand.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it was clear that, outside the Assembly, the\r\ndifferent parties, while dreading the contest, were actively preparing\r\nfor it. The wealthy legions of the National Guard offered banquets to\r\nthe army and to the Garde Mobile, in which they mutually urged each\r\nother to unite for the common defence.\r\n\r\nThe workmen of the suburbs, on their side, were secretly amassing that\r\ngreat number of cartridges which enabled them later to sustain so long a\r\ncontest. As to the muskets, the Provisional Government had taken care\r\nthat these should be supplied in profusion; one could safely say that\r\nthere was not a workman who did not possess at least one, and sometimes\r\nseveral.\r\n\r\nThe danger was perceived afar off as well as near at hand. The provinces\r\ngrew indignant and irritated with Paris; for the first time for sixty\r\nyears they ventured to entertain the idea of resisting it; the people\r\narmed themselves and encouraged each other to come to the assistance of\r\nthe Assembly; they sent it thousands of addresses congratulating it on\r\nits victory of the 15th of May. The ruin of commerce, universal war, the\r\ndread of Socialism made the Republic more and more hateful in the eyes\r\nof the provinces. This hatred manifested itself especially beneath the\r\nsecrecy of the ballot. The electors were called upon to re-elect in\r\ntwenty-one departments; and in general they elected the men who in their\r\neyes represented the Monarchy in some form or other. M. Mole was elected\r\nat Bordeaux, and M. Thiers at Rouen.\r\n\r\nIt was then that suddenly, for the first time, the name of Louis\r\nNapoleon came into notice. The Prince was elected at the same time in\r\nParis and in several departments. Republicans, Legitimists and\r\ndemagogues gave him their votes; for the nation at that time was like a\r\nfrightened flock of sheep, which runs in all directions without\r\nfollowing any road. I little thought, when I heard that Louis Napoleon\r\nhad been nominated, that exactly a year later I should be his minister.\r\nI confess that I beheld the return of the old parliamentary leaders with\r\nconsiderable apprehension and regret; not that I failed to do justice to\r\ntheir talent and discretion, but I feared lest their approach should\r\ndrive back towards the Mountain the moderate Republicans who were coming\r\ntowards us. Moreover, I knew them too well not to see that, so soon as\r\nthey had returned to political life, they would wish to lead it, and\r\nthat it would not suit them to save the country unless they could govern\r\nit. Now an enterprise of this sort seemed to me both premature and\r\ndangerous. Our duty and theirs was to assist the moderate Republicans to\r\ngovern the Republic without seeking to govern it indirectly ourselves,\r\nand especially without appearing to have this in view.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I never doubted but that we were on the eve of a terrible\r\nstruggle; nevertheless, I did not fully understand our danger until\r\nafter a conversation that I had about this time with the celebrated\r\nMadame Sand. I met her at an Englishman's of my acquaintance:\r\nMilnes,[10] a member of Parliament, who was then in Paris. Milnes was a\r\nclever fellow who did and, what is rarer, said many foolish things. What\r\na number of those faces I have seen in my life of which one can say that\r\nthe two profiles are not alike: men of sense on one side, fools on the\r\nother. I have always seen Milnes infatuated with something or somebody.\r\nThis time he was smitten with Madame Sand, and notwithstanding the\r\nseriousness of events, had insisted on giving her a literary _dejeuner_.\r\nI was present at this repast, and the image of the days of June, which\r\nfollowed so closely after, far from effacing the remembrance of it from\r\nmy mind, recalls it.\r\n\r\n     [10: The Right Honble. Monckton Milnes, the late Lord\r\n     Houghton.--A.T. de M.]\r\n\r\nThe company was anything but homogeneous. Besides Madame Sand, I met a\r\nyoung English lady, very modest and very agreeable, who must have found\r\nthe company invited to meet her somewhat singular; some more or less\r\nobscure writers; and Merimee. Milnes placed me next to Madame Sand. I\r\nhad never spoken to her, and I doubt whether I had ever seen her (I had\r\nlived little in the world of literary adventurers which she frequented).\r\nOne of my friends asked her one day what she thought of my book on\r\nAmerica, and she answered, \"Monsieur, I am only accustomed to read the\r\nbooks which are presented to me by their authors.\" I was strongly\r\nprejudiced against Madame Sand, for I loathe women who write,\r\nespecially those who systematically disguise the weaknesses of their\r\nsex, instead of interesting us by displaying them in their true\r\ncharacter. Nevertheless, she pleased me. I thought her features rather\r\nmassive, but her expression admirable: all her mind seemed to have taken\r\nrefuge in her eyes, abandoning the rest of her face to matter; and I was\r\nparticularly struck at meeting in her with something of the naturalness\r\nof behaviour of great minds. She had a real simplicity of manner and\r\nlanguage, which she mingled, perhaps, with some little affectation of\r\nsimplicity in her dress. I confess that, more adorned, she would have\r\nappeared still more simple. We talked for a whole hour of public\r\naffairs; it was impossible to talk of anything else in those days.\r\nBesides, Madame Sand at that time was a sort of politician, and what she\r\nsaid on the subject struck me greatly; it was the first time that I had\r\nentered into direct and familiar communication with a person able and\r\nwilling to tell me what was happening in the camp of our adversaries.\r\nPolitical parties never know each other: they approach, touch, seize,\r\nbut never see one another. Madame Sand depicted to me, in great detail\r\nand with singular vivacity, the condition of the Paris workmen, their\r\norganization, their numbers, their arms, their preparations, their\r\nthoughts, their passions, their terrible resolves. I thought the picture\r\noverloaded, but it was not, as subsequent events clearly proved. She\r\nseemed to be alarmed for herself at the popular triumph, and to take\r\nthe greatest pity upon the fate that awaited us.\r\n\r\n\"Try to persuade your friends, monsieur,\" she said, \"not to force the\r\npeople into the streets by alarming or irritating them. I also wish that\r\nI could instil patience into my own friends; for if it comes to a fight,\r\nbelieve me, you will all be killed.\"\r\n\r\nWith these consoling words we parted, and I have never seen her since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n     THE DAYS OF JUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI come at last to the insurrection of June, the most extensive and the\r\nmost singular that has occurred in our history, and perhaps in any\r\nother: the most extensive, because, during four days, more than a\r\nhundred thousand men were engaged in it; the most singular, because the\r\ninsurgents fought without a war-cry, without leaders, without flags, and\r\nyet with a marvellous harmony and an amount of military experience that\r\nastonished the oldest officers.\r\n\r\nWhat distinguished it also, among all the events of this kind which have\r\nsucceeded one another in France for sixty years, is that it did not aim\r\nat changing the form of government, but at altering the order of\r\nsociety. It was not, strictly speaking, a political struggle, in the\r\nsense which until then we had given to the word, but a combat of class\r\nagainst class, a sort of Servile War. It represented the facts of the\r\nRevolution of February in the same manner as the theories of Socialism\r\nrepresented its ideas; or rather it issued naturally from these ideas,\r\nas a son does from his mother. We behold in it nothing more than a blind\r\nand rude, but powerful, effort on the part of the workmen to escape from\r\nthe necessities of their condition, which had been depicted to them as\r\none of unlawful oppression, and to open up by main force a road towards\r\nthat imaginary comfort with which they had been deluded. It was this\r\nmixture of greed and false theory which first gave birth to the\r\ninsurrection and then made it so formidable. These poor people had been\r\ntold that the wealth of the rich was in some way the produce of a theft\r\npractised upon themselves. They had been assured that the inequality of\r\nfortunes was as opposed to morality and the welfare of society as it was\r\nto nature. Prompted by their needs and their passions, many had believed\r\nthis obscure and erroneous notion of right, which, mingled with brute\r\nforce, imparted to the latter an energy, a tenacity and a power which it\r\nwould never have possessed unaided.\r\n\r\nIt must also be observed that this formidable insurrection was not the\r\nenterprise of a certain number of conspirators, but the revolt of one\r\nwhole section of the population against another. Women took part in it\r\nas well as men. While the latter fought, the former prepared and carried\r\nammunition; and when at last the time had come to surrender, the women\r\nwere the last to yield. These women went to battle with, as it were, a\r\nhousewifely ardour: they looked to victory for the comfort of their\r\nhusbands and the education of their children. They took pleasure in this\r\nwar as they might have taken pleasure in a lottery.\r\n\r\nAs to the strategic science displayed by this multitude, the warlike\r\nnature of the French, their long experience of insurrections, and\r\nparticularly the military education which the majority of the men of the\r\npeople in turn receive, suffice to explain it. Half of the Paris workmen\r\nhave served in our armies, and they are always glad to take up arms\r\nagain. Generally speaking, old soldiers abound in our riots. On the 24th\r\nof February, when Lamoriciere was surrounded by his foes, he twice owed\r\nhis life to insurgents who had fought under him in Africa, men in whom\r\nthe recollection of their military life had been stronger than the fury\r\nof civil war.\r\n\r\nAs we know, it was the closing of the national workshops that occasioned\r\nthe rising. Dreading to disband this formidable soldiery at one stroke,\r\nthe Government had tried to disperse it by sending part of the workmen\r\ninto the country. They refused to leave. On the 22nd of June, they\r\nmarched through Paris in troops, singing in cadence, in a monotonous\r\nchant, \"We won't be sent away, we won't be sent away....\" Their\r\ndelegates waited upon the members of the Committee of the Executive\r\nPower with a series of arrogant demands, and on meeting with a refusal,\r\nwithdrew with the announcement that next day they would have recourse to\r\narms. Everything, indeed, tended to show that the long-expected crisis\r\nhad come.\r\n\r\nWhen this news reached the Assembly it caused the greatest alarm.\r\nNevertheless, the Assembly did not interrupt its order of the day; it\r\ncontinued the discussion of a commercial act, and even listened to it,\r\ndespite its excited condition; true, it was a very important question\r\nand a very eminent orator was speaking. The Government had proposed to\r\nacquire all the railways by purchase. Montalembert opposed it; his case\r\nwas good, but his speech was excellent; I do not think I ever heard him\r\nspeak so well before or since. As a matter of fact, I thought as he did,\r\nthis time; but I believe that, even in the eyes of his adversaries, he\r\nsurpassed himself. He made a vigorous attack without being as peevish\r\nand outrageous as usual. A certain fear tempered his natural insolence,\r\nand set a limit to his paradoxical and querulous humour; for, like so\r\nmany other men of words, he had more temerity of language than stoutness\r\nof heart.\r\n\r\nThe sitting concluded without any question as to what was occurring\r\noutside, and the Assembly adjourned.\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd, on going to the Assembly, I saw a large number of omnibuses\r\ngrouped round the Madeleine. This told me that they were beginning to\r\nerect barricades in the streets; which was confirmed on my arrival at\r\nthe Palace. Nevertheless, a doubt was expressed whether it was seriously\r\ncontemplated to resort to arms. I resolved to go and assure myself of\r\nthe real state of things, and, with Corcelles, repaired to the\r\nneighbourhood of the Hotel de Ville. In all the little streets\r\nsurrounding that building, I found the people engaged in making\r\nbarricades; they proceeded in their work with the cunning and regularity\r\nof an engineer, not unpaving more stones than were necessary to lay the\r\nfoundations of a very thick, solid and even neatly-built wall, in which\r\nthey generally left a small opening by the side of the houses to permit\r\nof ingress and egress. Eager for quicker information as to the state of\r\nthe town, Corcelles and I agreed to separate. He went one way and I the\r\nother; and his excursion very nearly turned out badly. He told me\r\nafterwards that, after crossing several half-built barricades without\r\nimpediment, he was stopped at the last one. The men of the lower orders\r\nwho were building it, seeing a fine gentleman, in black clothes and very\r\nwhite linen, quietly trotting through the dirty streets round the Hotel\r\nde Ville and stopping before them with a placid and inquisitive air,\r\nthought they would make use of this suspicious onlooker. They called\r\nupon him, in the name of the brotherhood, to assist them in their work.\r\nCorcelles was as brave as Caesar, but he rightly judged that, under these\r\ncircumstances, there was nothing better to be done than to give way\r\nquietly. See him therefore lifting paving-stones and placing them as\r\nneatly as possible one atop the other. His natural awkwardness and his\r\nabsent-mindedness fortunately came to his aid; and he was soon sent\r\nabout his business as a useless workman.\r\n\r\nTo me no such adventure happened. I passed through the streets of the\r\nSaint-Martin and Saint-Denis quarters without coming across any\r\nbarricades to speak of; but the excitement was extraordinary. On my\r\nreturn I met, in the Rue des Jeuneurs, a National Guard covered with\r\nblood and fragments of brain. He was very pale and was going home. I\r\nasked him what was happening; he told me that his battalion had just\r\nreceived the full force of a very murderous discharge of musketry at the\r\nPorte Saint-Denis. One of his comrades, whose name he mentioned to me,\r\nhad been killed by his side, and he was covered with the blood and\r\nbrains of this unhappy man.\r\n\r\nI returned to the Assembly, astonished at not having met a single\r\nsoldier in the whole distance which I had traversed. It was not till I\r\ncame in front of the Palais-Bourbon that I at last perceived great\r\ncolumns of infantry, marching, followed by cannon.\r\n\r\nLamoriciere, in full uniform and on horseback, was at their head. I have\r\nnever seen a figure more resplendent with aggressive passion and almost\r\nwith joy; and whatever may have been the natural impetuosity of his\r\nhumour, I doubt whether it was that alone which urged him at that\r\nmoment, and whether there was not mingled with it an eagerness to avenge\r\nhimself for the dangers and outrages he had undergone.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing?\" I asked him. \"They have already been fighting at\r\nthe Porte Saint-Denis, and barricades are being built all round the\r\nHotel de Ville.\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience,\" he replied, \"we are going there. Do you think we are such\r\nfools as to scatter our soldiers on such a day as this over the small\r\nstreets of the suburbs? No, no! we shall let the insurgents concentrate\r\nin the quarters which we can't keep them out of, and then we will go and\r\ndestroy them. They sha'n't escape us this time.\"\r\n\r\nAs I reached the Assembly, a terrible storm broke, which flooded the\r\ntown. I entertained a slight hope that this bad weather would get us out\r\nof our difficulties for the day, and it would, indeed, have been enough\r\nto put a stop to an ordinary riot; for the people of Paris need fine\r\nweather to fight in, and are more afraid of rain than of grape-shot. But\r\nI soon lost this hope: each moment the news became more distressing. The\r\nAssembly found difficulty in resuming its ordinary work. Agitated,\r\nthough not overcome, by the excitement outside, it suspended the order\r\nof the day, returned to it, and finally suspended it for good, giving\r\nitself over to the preoccupations of the civil war. Different members\r\ncame and described from the rostrum what they had seen in Paris. Others\r\nsuggested various courses of action. Falloux, in the name of the\r\nCommittee of Public Assistance, proposed a decree dissolving the\r\nnational workshops, and received applause. Time was wasted with empty\r\nconversations, empty speeches. Nothing was known for certain; they kept\r\non calling for the attendance of the Executive Commission, to inform\r\nthem of the state of Paris, but the latter did not appear. There is\r\nnothing more pitiful than the spectacle of an assembly in a moment of\r\ncrisis, when the Government itself fails it; it resembles a man still\r\nfull of will and passion, but impotent, and tossing childishly amid the\r\nhelplessness of his limbs. At last appeared two members of the Executive\r\nCommission; they announced that affairs were in a perilous condition,\r\nbut that, nevertheless, it was hoped to crush the insurrection before\r\nnight. The Assembly declared its sitting permanent, and adjourned till\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\nWhen the sitting was resumed, we learnt that Lamartine had been received\r\nwith shots at all the barricades he attempted to approach. Two of our\r\ncolleagues, Bixio and Dornes, had been mortally wounded when trying to\r\naddress the insurgents. Bedeau had been shot through the thigh at the\r\nentrance to the Faubourg Saint-Jacques, and a number of officers of\r\ndistinction were already killed or dangerously wounded. One of our\r\nmembers, Victor Considerant, spoke of making concessions to the workmen.\r\nThe Assembly, which was tumultuous and disturbed, but not weak, revolted\r\nat these words: \"Order, order!\" they cried on every side, with a sort of\r\nrage, \"it will be time to talk of that after the victory!\" The rest of\r\nthe evening and a portion of the night were spent in vaguely talking,\r\nlistening, and waiting. About midnight, Cavaignac appeared. The\r\nExecutive Commission had since that afternoon placed the whole military\r\npower in his hands. In a hoarse and jerky voice, and in simple and\r\nprecise words, Cavaignac detailed the principal incidents of the day. He\r\nstated that he had given orders to all the regiments posted along the\r\nrailways to converge upon Paris, and that all the National Guards of the\r\noutskirts had been called out; he concluded by telling us that the\r\ninsurgents had been beaten back to the barriers, and that he hoped soon\r\nto have mastered the city. The Assembly, exhausted with fatigue, left\r\nits officials sitting in permanence, and adjourned until eight o'clock\r\nthe next morning.\r\n\r\nWhen, on quitting this turbulent scene, I found myself at one in the\r\nmorning on the Pont Royal, and from there beheld Paris wrapped in\r\ndarkness, and calm as a city asleep, it was with difficulty that I\r\npersuaded myself that all that I had seen and heard since the morning\r\nhad existed in reality and was not a pure creation of my brain. The\r\nstreets and squares which I crossed were absolutely deserted; not a\r\nsound, not a cry; one would have said that an industrious population,\r\nfatigued with its day's work, was resting before resuming the peaceful\r\nlabours of the morrow. The serenity of the night ended by over-mastering\r\nme; I brought myself to believe that we had triumphed already, and on\r\nreaching home I went straight to sleep.\r\n\r\nI woke very early in the morning. The sun had risen some time before,\r\nfor we were in the midst of the longest days of the year. On opening my\r\neyes, I heard a sharp, metallic sound, which shook the window-panes and\r\nimmediately died out amid the silence of Paris.\r\n\r\n\"What is that?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nMy wife replied, \"It is the cannon; I have heard it for over an hour,\r\nbut would not wake you, for I knew you would want your strength during\r\nthe day.\"\r\n\r\nI dressed hurriedly and went out. The drums were beating to arms on\r\nevery side: the day of the great battle had come at last. The National\r\nGuards left their homes under arms; all those I met seemed full of\r\nenergy, for the sound of cannon, which brought the brave ones out, kept\r\nthe others at home. But they were in bad humour: they thought themselves\r\neither badly commanded or betrayed by the Executive Power, against which\r\nthey uttered terrible imprecations. This extreme distrust of its leaders\r\non the part of the armed force seemed to me an alarming symptom.\r\nContinuing on my way, at the entrance to the Rue Saint-Honore, I met a\r\ncrowd of workmen anxiously listening to the cannon. These men were all\r\nin blouses, which, as we know, constitute their fighting as well as\r\ntheir working clothes; nevertheless, they had no arms, but one could see\r\nby their looks that they were quite ready to take them up. They\r\nremarked, with a hardly restrained joy, that the sound of the firing\r\nseemed to come nearer, which showed that the insurrection was gaining\r\nground. I had augured before this that the whole of the working class\r\nwas engaged, either in fact or in spirit, in the struggle; and this\r\nconfirmed my suspicions. The spirit of insurrection circulated from one\r\nend to the other of this immense class, and in each of its parts, as the\r\nblood does in the body; it filled the quarters where there was no\r\nfighting, as well as those which served as the scene of battle; it had\r\npenetrated into our houses, around, above, below us. The very places in\r\nwhich we thought ourselves the masters swarmed with domestic enemies;\r\none might say that an atmosphere of civil war enveloped the whole of\r\nParis, amid which, to whatever part we withdrew, we had to live; and in\r\nthis connection I shall violate the law I had imposed upon myself never\r\nto speak upon the word of another, and will relate a fact which I learnt\r\na few days later from my colleague Blanqui.[11] Although very trivial, I\r\nconsider it very characteristic of the physiognomy of the time. Blanqui\r\nhad brought up from the country and taken into his house, as a servant,\r\nthe son of a poor man, whose wretchedness had touched him. On the\r\nevening of the day on which the insurrection began, he heard this lad\r\nsay, as he was clearing the table after dinner, \"Next Sunday [it was\r\nThursday then] _we_ shall be eating the wings of the chicken;\" to which\r\na little girl who worked in the house replied, \"And _we_ shall be\r\nwearing fine silk dresses.\" Could anything give a better idea of the\r\ngeneral state of minds than this childish scene? And to complete it,\r\nBlanqui was very careful not to seem to hear these little monkeys: they\r\nreally frightened him. It was not until after the victory that he\r\nventured to send back the ambitious pair to their hovels.\r\n\r\n     [11: Of the Institute, a brother of Blanqui of the 15th of May.]\r\n\r\nAt last I reached the Assembly. The representatives were gathered in\r\ncrowds, although the time appointed for the sitting was not yet come.\r\nThe sound of the cannon had attracted them. The Palace had the\r\nappearance of a fortified town: battalions were encamped around, and\r\nguns were levelled at all the approaches leading to it.\r\n\r\nI found the Assembly very determined, but very ill at ease; and it must\r\nbe confessed there was enough to make it so. It was easy to perceive\r\nthrough the multitude of contradictory reports that we had to do with\r\nthe most universal, the best armed, and the most furious insurrection\r\never known in Paris. The national workshops and various revolutionary\r\nbands that had just been disbanded supplied it with trained and\r\ndisciplined soldiers and with leaders. It was extending every moment,\r\nand it was difficult to believe that it would not end by being\r\nvictorious, when one remembered that all the great insurrections of the\r\nlast sixty years had triumphed. To all these enemies we were only able\r\nto oppose the battalions of the _bourgeoisie_, regiments which had been\r\ndisarmed in February, and twenty thousand undisciplined lads of the\r\nGarde Mobile, who were all sons, brothers, or near relations of\r\ninsurgents, and whose dispositions were doubtful.\r\n\r\nBut what alarmed us most was our leaders. The members of the Executive\r\nCommission filled us with profound distrust. On this subject I\r\nencountered, in the Assembly, the same feelings which I had observed\r\namong the National Guard. We doubted the good faith of some and the\r\ncapacity of others. They were too numerous, besides, and too much\r\ndivided to be able to act in complete harmony, and they were too much\r\nmen of speech and the pen to be able to act to good purpose under such\r\ncircumstances, even if they had agreed among themselves.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, we succeeded in triumphing over this so formidable\r\ninsurrection; nay more, it was just that which rendered it so terrible\r\nwhich saved us. One might well apply in this case the famous phrase of\r\nthe Prince de Conde, during the wars of religion: \"We should have been\r\ndestroyed, had we not been so near destruction.\" Had the revolt borne a\r\nless radical character and a less ferocious aspect, it is probable that\r\nthe greater part of the middle class would have stayed at home; France\r\nwould not have come to our aid; the National Assembly itself would\r\nperhaps have yielded, or at least a minority of its members would have\r\nadvised it; and the energy of the whole body would have been greatly\r\nunnerved. But the insurrection was of such a nature that any commerce\r\nwith it became at once impossible, and from the first it left us no\r\nalternative but to defeat it or to be destroyed ourselves.\r\n\r\nThe same reason prevented any man of consideration from placing himself\r\nat its head. In general, insurrections--I mean even those which\r\nsucceed--begin without a leader; but they always end by securing one.\r\nThis insurrection finished without having found one; it embraced every\r\nclass of the populace, but never passed those limits. Even the\r\nMontagnards in the Assembly did not dare pronounce in its favour.\r\nSeveral pronounced against it. They did not even yet despair of\r\nattaining their ends by other means; they feared, moreover, that the\r\ntriumph of the workmen would soon prove fatal to them. The greedy, blind\r\nand vulgar passions which induced the populace to take up arms alarmed\r\nthem; for these passions are as dangerous to those who sympathize with\r\nthem, without utterly abandoning themselves to them, as to those who\r\nreprove and combat them. The only men who could have placed themselves\r\nat the head of the insurgents had allowed themselves to be prematurely\r\ntaken, like fools, on the 15th of May; and they only heard the sound of\r\nthe conflict through the walls of the dungeon of Vincennes.\r\n\r\nPreoccupied though I was with public affairs, I continued to be\r\ndistressed with the uneasiness which my young nephews once more caused\r\nme. They had been sent back to the Little Seminary, and I feared\r\nthat the insurrection must come pretty near, if it had not already\r\nreached, the place where they lived. As their parents were not in\r\nParis, I decided to go and fetch them, and I accordingly again traversed\r\nthe long distance separating the Palais-Bourbon from the Rue\r\nNotre-Dame-des-Champs. I came across a few barricades erected during the\r\nnight by the forlorn hope of the insurrection; but these had been either\r\nabandoned or captured at daybreak.\r\n\r\nAll these quarters resounded with a devilish music, a mixture of drums\r\nand trumpets, whose rough, discordant, savage notes were new to me. In\r\nfact, I heard for the first time--and I have never heard it since--the\r\nrally, which it had been decided should never be beaten except in\r\nextreme cases and to call the whole population at once to arms.\r\nEverywhere National Guards were issuing from the houses; everywhere\r\nstood groups of workmen in blouses, listening with a sinister air to the\r\nrally and the cannon. The fighting had not yet reached so far as the Rue\r\nNotre-Dame-des-Champs, although it was very near it. I took my nephews\r\nwith me, and returned to the Chamber.\r\n\r\nAs I approached, and when I was already in the midst of the troops which\r\nguarded it, an old woman, pushing a barrow full of vegetables,\r\nobstinately barred my progress. I ended by telling her pretty curtly to\r\nmake way. Instead of doing so, she left her barrow and flew at me in\r\nsuch a frenzy that I had great difficulty in protecting myself. I was\r\nhorrified at the hideous and frightful expression of her face, on which\r\nwere depicted all the fury of demagogic passion and the rage of civil\r\nwar. I mention this little fact because I beheld in it, and with good\r\ncause, an important symptom. In violently critical times, even actions\r\nwhich have nothing to do with politics assume a singular character of\r\nanger and disorder, which does not escape the attentive eye, and which\r\nis an unfailing index of the general state of mind. These great public\r\nexcitements form a sort of glowing atmosphere in which all private\r\npassions seethe and bubble.\r\n\r\nI found the Assembly agitated by a thousand sinister reports. The\r\ninsurrection was gaining ground in every direction. Its head-quarters,\r\nor, so to speak, its trunk, was behind the Hotel de Ville, whence it\r\nstretched its long arms further and further to right and left into the\r\nsuburbs, and threatened soon to hug even us. The cannon was drawing\r\nappreciably nearer. And to this correct news were added a thousand lying\r\nrumours. Some said that our troops were running short of ammunition;\r\nothers, that a number of them had laid down their arms or gone over to\r\nthe insurgents.\r\n\r\nM. Thiers asked Barrot, Dufaure, Remusat, Lanjuinais and myself to\r\nfollow him to a private room. There he said:\r\n\r\n\"I know something of insurrections, and I tell you this is the worst I\r\nhave ever seen. The insurgents may be here within an hour, and we shall\r\nbe butchered one and all. Do you not think that it would be well for us\r\nto agree to propose to the Assembly, so soon as we think necessary and\r\nbefore it becomes too late, that it should call back the troops around\r\nit, in order that, placed in their midst, we may all leave Paris\r\ntogether and remove the seat of the Republic to a place where we could\r\nsummon the army and all the National Guards in France to our\r\nassistance?\"\r\n\r\nHe said this in very eager tones and with a greater display of\r\nexcitement than is, perhaps, advisable in the presence of great danger.\r\nI saw that he was pursued by the ghost of February. Dufaure, who had a\r\nless vivid imagination, and who, moreover, never readily made up his\r\nmind to associate himself with people he did not care about, even to\r\nsave himself, phlegmatically and somewhat sarcastically explained that\r\nthe time had not yet come to discuss a plan of this kind; that we could\r\nalways talk of it later on; that our chances did not seem to him so\r\ndesperate as to oblige us to entertain so extreme a remedy; that to\r\nentertain it was to weaken ourselves. He was undoubtedly right, and his\r\nwords broke up the consultation. I at once wrote a few lines to my wife,\r\ntelling her that the danger was hourly increasing, that Paris would\r\nperhaps end by falling entirely into the power of the revolt, and that,\r\nin that case, we should be obliged to leave it in order to carry on the\r\ncivil war elsewhere. I charged her to go at once to Saint-Germain by\r\nthe railroad, which was still free, and there to await my news; told my\r\nnephews to take the letter; and returned to the Assembly. I found them\r\ndiscussing a decree to proclaim Paris in a state of siege, to abolish\r\nthe powers of the Executive Commission, and to replace it by a military\r\ndictatorship under General Cavaignac.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly knew precisely that this was what it wanted. The thing was\r\neasily done: it was urgent, and yet it was not done. Each moment some\r\nlittle incident, some trivial motion interrupted and turned aside the\r\ncurrent of the general wish; for assemblies are very liable to that sort\r\nof nightmare in which an unknown and invisible force seems always at the\r\nlast moment to interpose between the will and the deed and to prevent\r\nthe one from influencing the other. Who would have thought that it was\r\nBastide who should eventually induce the Assembly to make up its mind?\r\nYet he it was.\r\n\r\nI had heard him say--and it was very true--speaking of himself, that he\r\nwas never able to remember more than the first fifteen words of a\r\nspeech. But I have sometimes observed that men who do not know how to\r\nspeak produce a greater impression, under certain circumstances, than\r\nthe finest orators. They bring forward but a single idea, that of the\r\nmoment, clothed in a single phrase, and somehow they lay it down in the\r\nrostrum like an inscription written in big letters, which everybody\r\nperceives, and in which each instantly recognizes his own particular\r\nthought. Bastide, then, displayed his long, honest, melancholy face in\r\nthe tribune, and said, with a mournful air:\r\n\r\n\"Citizens, in the name of the country, I beseech you to vote as quickly\r\nas possible. We are told that perhaps within an hour the Hotel de Ville\r\nwill be taken.\"\r\n\r\nThese few words put an end to debate, and the decree was voted in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\nI protested against the clause proclaiming Paris in a state of siege; I\r\ndid so by instinct rather than reflection. I have such a contempt and so\r\ngreat a natural horror for military despotism that these feelings came\r\nrising tumultuously in my breast when I heard a state of siege\r\nsuggested, and even dominated those prompted by our peril. In this I\r\nmade a mistake in which I fortunately found few to imitate me.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Executive Commission have asserted in very bitter\r\nterms that their adversaries and the partisans of General Cavaignac\r\nspread ominous rumours on purpose to precipitate the vote. If the latter\r\ndid really resort to this trick, I gladly pardon them, for the measures\r\nthey caused to be taken were indispensable to the safety of the country.\r\n\r\nBefore adopting the decree of which I have spoken, the Assembly\r\nunanimously voted another, which declared that the families of those who\r\nshould fall in the struggle should receive a pension from the Treasury\r\nand their children be adopted by the Republic.\r\n\r\nIt was decided that sixty members of the Chamber, appointed by the\r\ncommittees, should spread themselves over Paris, inform the National\r\nGuards of the different decrees issued by the Assembly, and re-establish\r\ntheir confidence, which was said to be uncertain and discouraged. In the\r\ncommittee to which I belonged, instead of immediately appointing\r\ncommissioners, they began an endless discussion on the uselessness and\r\ndanger of the resolution adopted. In this manner a great deal of time\r\nwas lost. I ended by stopping this ludicrous chatter with a word.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" I said, \"the Assembly may have been mistaken; but permit me\r\nto observe that, having passed a two-fold resolution, it would be a\r\ndisgrace for it to draw back, and a disgrace for us not to submit.\"\r\n\r\nThey voted on the spot; and I was unanimously elected a commissioner, as\r\nI expected. My colleagues were Cormenin and Cremieux, to whom they added\r\nGoudchaux. The latter was then not so well known, although in his own\r\nway he was the most original of them all. He was at once a Radical and a\r\nbanker, a rare combination; and by dint of his business occupations, he\r\nhad succeeded by covering with a few reasonable ideas the foundation of\r\nhis mind, which was filled with mad theories that always ended by making\r\ntheir way to the top. It was impossible to be vainer, more irascible,\r\nmore quarrelsome, petulant or excitable than he. He was unable to\r\ndiscuss the difficulties of the Budget without shedding tears; and yet\r\nhe was one of the valiantest little men it was possible to meet.\r\n\r\nThanks to the stormy discussion in our committee, the other deputations\r\nhad already left, and with them the guides and the escort who were to\r\nhave accompanied us. Nevertheless, we set out, after putting on our\r\nscarves, and turned our steps alone and a little at hazard towards the\r\ninterior of Paris, along the right bank of the Seine. By that time the\r\ninsurrection had made such progress that one could see the cannon drawn\r\nup in line and firing between the Pont des Arts and the Pont Neuf. The\r\nNational Guards, who saw us from the top of the embankment, looked at us\r\nwith anxiety; they respectfully took off their hats, and said in an\r\nundertone, and with grief-stricken accents, \"Long live the National\r\nAssembly!\" No noisy cheers uttered at the sight of a king ever came more\r\nvisibly from the heart, or pointed to a more unfeigned sympathy. When we\r\nhad passed through the gates and were on the Carrousel, I saw that\r\nCormenin and Cremieux were imperceptibly making for the Tuileries, and I\r\nheard one of them, I forget which, say:\r\n\r\n\"Where can we go? And what can we do of any use without guides? Is it\r\nnot best to content ourselves with going through the Tuileries gardens?\r\nThere are several battalions of the reserve stationed there; we will\r\ninform them of the decrees of the Assembly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the other; \"I even think we shall be executing the\r\nAssembly's instructions better than our colleagues; for what can one say\r\nto people already engaged in action? It is the reserves that we should\r\nprepare to fall into line in their turn.\"\r\n\r\nI have always thought it rather interesting to follow the involuntary\r\nmovements of fear in clever people. Fools coarsely display their\r\ncowardice in all its nakedness; but the others are able to cover it with\r\na veil so delicate, so daintily woven with small, plausible lies, that\r\nthere is some pleasure to be found in contemplating this ingenious work\r\nof the brain.\r\n\r\nAs may be supposed, I was in no humour for a stroll in the Tuileries\r\ngardens. I had set out in none too good a temper; but it was no good\r\ncrying over spilt milk. I therefore pointed out to Goudchaux the road\r\nour colleagues had taken.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" he said, angrily; \"I shall leave them and I will make public\r\nthe decrees of the Assembly without them.\"\r\n\r\nTogether we made for the gate opposite. Cormenin and Cremieux soon\r\nrejoined us, a little ashamed of their attempt. Thus we reached the Rue\r\nSaint-Honore, the appearance of which was perhaps what struck me most\r\nduring the days of June. This noisy, populous street was at this moment\r\nmore deserted than I had ever seen it at four o'clock on a winter\r\nmorning. As far as the eye could reach, we perceived not a living soul;\r\nthe shops, doors and windows were hermetically closed. Nothing was\r\nvisible, nothing stirred; we heard no sound of a wheel, no clatter of a\r\nhorse, no human footstep, but only the voice of the cannon, which seemed\r\nto resound through an abandoned city. Yet the houses were not empty; for\r\nas we walked on, we could catch glimpses at the windows of women and\r\nchildren who, with their faces glued to the panes, watched us go by with\r\nan affrighted air.\r\n\r\nAt last, near the Palais-Royal, we met some large bodies of National\r\nGuards, and our mission commenced. When Cremieux saw that it was only a\r\nquestion of talking, he became all ardour; he told them of what had\r\nhappened at the National Assembly, and held forth to them in a little\r\n_bravura_ speech which was heartily applauded. We found an escort there,\r\nand passed on. We wandered a long time through the little streets of\r\nthat district, until we came in front of the great barricade of the Rue\r\nRambuteau, which was not yet taken and which stopped our further\r\nprogress. From there we came back again through all those little\r\nstreets, which were covered with blood from the recent combats: they\r\nwere still fighting from time to time. For it was a war of ambuscades,\r\nwhose scene was not fixed but every moment changed. When one least\r\nexpected it, one was shot at through a garret window; and on breaking\r\ninto the house, one found the gun but not the marksman: the latter\r\nescaped by a back-door while the front-door was being battered in. For\r\nthis reason the National Guards had orders to have all the shutters\r\nopened, and to fire on all those who showed themselves at the windows;\r\nand they obeyed these orders so literally that they narrowly escaped\r\nkilling several merely inquisitive people whom the sight of our scarves\r\ntempted to put their noses outside.\r\n\r\nDuring this walk of two or three hours, we had to make at least thirty\r\nspeeches; I refer to Cremieux and myself, for Goudchaux was only able to\r\nspeak on finance, and as to Cormenin, he was always as dumb as a fish.\r\nTo tell the truth, almost all the burden of the day fell upon Cremieux.\r\nHe filled me, I will not say with admiration, but with surprise. Janvier\r\nhas said of Cremieux that he was \"an eloquent louse.\" If only he could\r\nhave seen him that day, jaded, with uncovered breast, dripping with\r\nperspiration and dirty with dust, wrapped in a long scarf twisted\r\nseveral times in every direction round his little body, but constantly\r\nhitting upon new ideas, or rather new words and phrases, now expressing\r\nin gestures what he had just expressed in words, then in words what he\r\nhad just expressed in gestures: always eloquent, always ardent! I do not\r\nbelieve that anyone has ever seen, and I doubt whether anyone has ever\r\nimagined, a man who was uglier or more fluent.\r\n\r\nI observed that when the National Guards were told that Paris was in a\r\nstate of siege, they were pleased, and when one added that the Executive\r\nCommission was overthrown, they cheered. Never were people so delighted\r\nto be relieved of their liberty and their government. And yet this was\r\nwhat Lamartine's popularity had come to in less than two months.\r\n\r\nWhen we had done speaking, the men surrounded us; they asked us if we\r\nwere quite sure that the Executive Commission had ceased to act; we had\r\nto show them the decree to satisfy them.\r\n\r\nParticularly remarkable was the firm attitude of these men. We had come\r\nto encourage them, and it was rather they who encouraged us. \"Hold on at\r\nthe National Assembly,\" they cried, \"and we'll hold on here. Courage! no\r\ntransactions with the insurgents! We'll put an end to the revolt: all\r\nwill end well.\" I had never seen the National Guard so resolute before,\r\nnor do I think that we could rely upon finding it so again; for its\r\ncourage was prompted by necessity and despair, and proceeded from\r\ncircumstances which are not likely to recur.\r\n\r\nParis on that day reminded me of a city of antiquity whose citizens\r\ndefended the walls like heroes, because they knew that if the city were\r\ntaken they themselves would be dragged into slavery. As we turned our\r\nsteps back towards the Assembly, Goudchaux left us. \"Now that we have\r\ndone our errand,\" said he, clenching his teeth, and in an accent half\r\nGascon and half Alsatian, \"I want to go and fight a bit.\" He said this\r\nwith such a martial air, so little in harmony with his pacific\r\nappearance, that I could not help smiling.\r\n\r\nHe did, in fact, go and fight, as I heard the next day, and so well that\r\nhe might have had his little paunch pierced in two or three places, had\r\nfate so willed it. I returned from my round convinced that we should\r\ncome out victorious; and what I saw on nearing the Assembly confirmed my\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\nThousands of men were hastening to our aid from every part of France,\r\nand entering the city by all the roads not commanded by the insurgents.\r\nThanks to the railroads, some had already come from fifty leagues'\r\ndistance, although the fighting had only begun the night before. On the\r\nnext and the subsequent days, they came from distances of a hundred and\r\ntwo hundred leagues. These men belonged indiscriminately to every class\r\nof society; among them were many peasants, many shopkeepers, many\r\nlandlords and nobles, all mingled together in the same ranks. They were\r\narmed in an irregular and insufficient manner, but they rushed into\r\nParis with unequalled ardour: a spectacle as strange and unprecedented\r\nin our revolutionary annals as that offered by the insurrection itself.\r\nIt was evident from that moment that we should end by gaining the day,\r\nfor the insurgents received no reinforcements, whereas we had all France\r\nfor reserves.\r\n\r\nOn the Place Louis XV., I met, surrounded by the armed inhabitants of\r\nhis canton, my kinsman Lepelletier d'Aunay, who was Vice-President of\r\nthe Chamber of Deputies during the last days of the Monarchy. He wore\r\nneither uniform nor musket, but only a little silver-hilted sword which\r\nhe had slung at his side over his coat by a narrow white linen\r\nbandolier. I was touched to tears on seeing this venerable white-haired\r\nman thus accoutred.\r\n\r\n\"Won't you come and dine with us this evening?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" he replied; \"what would these good folk who are with me, and\r\nwho know that I have more to lose than they by the victory of the\r\ninsurrection--what would they say if they saw me leaving them to take it\r\neasy? No, I will share their repast and sleep here at their bivouac. The\r\nonly thing I would beg you is, if possible, to hurry the despatch of the\r\nprovision of bread promised us, for we have had no food since morning.\"\r\n\r\nI returned to the Assembly, I believe at about three, and did not go out\r\nagain. The remainder of the day was taken up by accounts of the\r\nfighting: each moment produced its event and its piece of news. The\r\narrival of volunteers from one of the departments was announced; they\r\nwere bringing in prisoners; flags captured on the barricades were\r\nbrought in. Deeds of bravery were described, heroic words repeated; each\r\nmoment we learnt of some person of note being wounded or killed. As to\r\nthe final issue of the day, nothing had yet occurred to enable us to\r\nform an opinion.\r\n\r\nThe President only called the Assembly together at infrequent intervals\r\nand for short periods; and he was right, for assemblies are like\r\nchildren, and idleness always makes them say or do a number of foolish\r\nthings. Each time the sitting was resumed, he himself told us all that\r\nhad been learnt for certain during the adjournment. This President, as\r\nwe know, was Senard, a well-known Rouen advocate and a man of courage;\r\nbut in his youth he had contracted so deep-seated a theatrical habit in\r\nthe daily comedy played at the bar that he had lost the faculty of\r\ntruthfully giving his true impressions of a thing, when by accident he\r\nhappened to have any. It seemed always necessary that he should add some\r\nturgidity or other of his own to the feats of courage he described, and\r\nthat he should express the emotion, which I believe he really felt, in\r\nhollow tones, a trembling voice, and a sort of tragic hiccough which\r\nreminded one of an actor on the stage. Never were the sublime and the\r\nridiculous brought so close together: for the facts were sublime and the\r\nnarrator ridiculous.\r\n\r\nWe did not adjourn till late at night to take a little rest. The\r\nfighting had stopped, to be resumed on the morrow. The insurrection,\r\nalthough everywhere held in check, had as yet been stifled nowhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n     THE DAYS OF JUNE--(_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe porter of the house in which we lived in the Rue de la Madeleine was\r\na man of very bad reputation in the neighbourhood, an old soldier, not\r\nquite in his right mind, a drunkard, and a great good-for-nothing, who\r\nspent at the wine-shop all the time which he did not employ in beating\r\nhis wife. This man might be said to be a Socialist by birth, or rather\r\nby temperament.\r\n\r\nThe early successes of the insurrection had brought him to a state of\r\nexaltation, and on the morning of the day of which I speak he visited\r\nall the wine-shops around, and among other mischievous remarks of which\r\nhe delivered himself, he said that he would kill me when I came home in\r\nthe evening, if I came in at all. He even displayed a large knife which\r\nhe intended to use for the purpose. A poor woman who heard him ran in\r\ngreat alarm to tell Madame de Tocqueville; and she, before leaving\r\nParis, sent me a note in which, after telling me of the facts, she\r\nbegged me not to come in that night, but to go to my father's house,\r\nwhich was close by, he being away. This I determined to do; but when I\r\nleft the Assembly at midnight, I had not the energy to carry out my\r\nintention. I was worn out with fatigue, and I did not know whether I\r\nshould find a bed prepared if I slept out. Besides, I had little faith\r\nin the performance of murders proclaimed beforehand; and also I was\r\nunder the influence of the sort of listlessness that follows upon any\r\nprolonged excitement. I accordingly went and knocked at my door, only\r\ntaking the precaution to load the pistols which, in those unhappy days,\r\nit was common to carry. My man opened the door, I entered, and while he\r\nwas carefully pushing the bolts behind me, I asked him if all the\r\ntenants had come home. He replied drily that they had all left Paris\r\nthat morning, and that we two were alone in the house. I should have\r\npreferred another kind of _tete-a-tete_, but it was too late to go back;\r\nI therefore looked him straight in the eyes and told him to walk in\r\nfront and show a light.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at a gate that led to the court-yard, and told me that he\r\nheard a curious noise in the stables which alarmed him, begging me to go\r\nwith him to see what it was. As he spoke, he turned towards the stables.\r\nAll this began to seem very suspicious to me, but I thought that, as I\r\nhad gone so far, it was better to go on. I accordingly followed him,\r\ncarefully watching his movements, and making up my mind to kill him like\r\na dog at the first sign of treachery. As a matter of fact, we did hear a\r\nvery strange noise. It resembled the dull running of water or the\r\ndistant rumble of a carriage, although it obviously came from somewhere\r\nquite near. I never learnt what it was; though it was true I did not\r\nspend much time in trying to discover. I soon returned to the house and\r\nmade my companion bring me to my threshold, keeping my eyes on him the\r\nwhole time. I told him to open my door, and so soon as he had done so, I\r\ntook the candle from his hand and went in. It was not until I was almost\r\nout of his sight that he brought himself to take off his hat and bow to\r\nme. Had the man really intended to kill me, and seeing me on my guard,\r\nwith both hands in my pockets, did he reflect that I was better armed\r\nthan he, and that he would be well advised to abandon his design? I\r\nthought at the time that the latter had never been very seriously\r\nintended, and I think so still. In times of revolution, people boast\r\nalmost as much about the imaginary crimes they propose to commit as in\r\nordinary times they do of the good intentions they pretend to entertain.\r\nI have always believed that this wretch would only have become dangerous\r\nif the fortunes of the fight had seemed to turn against us; but they\r\nleant, on the contrary, to our side, although they were still undecided;\r\nand this was sufficient to assure my safety.\r\n\r\nAt dawn I heard some one in my room, and woke with a start: it was my\r\nman-servant, who had let himself in with a private key of the apartment,\r\nwhich he carried. The brave lad had just left the bivouac (I had\r\nsupplied him at his request with a National Guard's uniform and a good\r\ngun), and he came to know if I had come home and if his services were\r\nrequired. This one was certainly not a Socialist, either in theory or\r\ntemperament. He was not even tainted in the slightest degree with the\r\nmost general malady of the age, restlessness of mind, and even in other\r\ntimes than ours it would have been difficult to find a man more\r\ncontented with his position and less sullen at his lot. Always very much\r\nsatisfied with himself, and tolerably satisfied with others, he\r\ngenerally desired only that which was within his reach, and he generally\r\nattained, or thought he attained, all that he desired; thus unwittingly\r\nfollowing the precepts which philosophers teach and never observe, and\r\nenjoying by the gift of Nature that happy equilibrium between faculty\r\nand desire which alone gives the happiness which philosophy promises us.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Eugene,\" I said, when I saw him, \"how are affairs going on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir, perfectly well!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by very well? I can still hear the sound of cannon!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they are still fighting,\" he replied, \"but every one says it will\r\nend all right.\"\r\n\r\nWith that he took off his uniform, cleaned my boots, brushed my clothes,\r\nand putting on his uniform again:\r\n\r\n\"If you don't require me any more, sir,\" said he, \"and if you will\r\npermit me, I will go back to the fighting.\"\r\n\r\nHe pursued this two-fold calling during four days and four nights, as\r\nsimply as I am writing it down; and I experienced a sort of reposeful\r\nfeeling, during these days filled with turmoil and hate, when I looked\r\nat the young man's peaceful and contented face.\r\n\r\nBefore going to the Assembly, where I did not think there would be any\r\nimportant measures to take, I resolved to make my way to the places\r\nwhere the fighting was still going on, and where I heard the sound of\r\ncannon. It was not that I was longing \"to go and fight a bit,\" like\r\nGoudchaux, but I wanted to judge for myself as to the state of things;\r\nfor, in my complete ignorance of war, I could not understand what made\r\nthe struggle last so long. Besides, shall I confess it, a keen curiosity\r\nwas piercing through all the feelings that filled my mind, and from time\r\nto time dominated them. I went along a great portion of the boulevard\r\nwithout seeing any traces of the battle, but there were plenty just\r\nbeyond the Porte Saint-Martin; one stumbled over the _debris_ left\r\nbehind by the retreating insurrection: broken windows, doors smashed in,\r\nhouses spotted by bullets or pierced by cannon-balls, trees cut down,\r\nheaped-up paving-stones, straw mixed with blood and mud. Such were these\r\nmelancholy vestiges.\r\n\r\nI thus reached the Chateau-d'Eau, around which were massed a number of\r\ntroops of different sorts. At the foot of the fountain was a piece of\r\ncannon which was being discharged down the Rue Samson. I thought at\r\nfirst that the insurgents were replying with cannon on their side, but I\r\nended by seeing that I was deceived by an echo which repeated with a\r\nterrible crash the sound of our own gun. I have never heard anything\r\nlike it; one might have thought one's self in the midst of a great\r\nbattle. As a matter of fact, the insurgents were only replying with an\r\ninfrequent but deadly musketry fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange combat. The Rue Samson, as we know, is not a very long\r\none; at the end runs the Canal Saint-Martin, and behind the canal is a\r\nlarge house facing the street. The street was absolutely deserted; there\r\nwas no barricade in sight, and the gun seemed to be firing at a target;\r\nonly from time to time a whiff of smoke issued from a few windows, and\r\nproclaimed the presence of an invisible enemy. Our sharp-shooters,\r\nposted along the walls, aimed at the windows from which they saw the\r\nshots fired. Lamoriciere, mounted on a tall horse in full view of the\r\nenemy, gave his commands amid the whirl of bullets. I thought he was\r\nmore excited and talkative than I had imagined a general ought to be in\r\nsuch a juncture; he talked, shouted in a hoarse voice, gesticulated in a\r\nsort of rage. It was easy to see by the clearness of his thoughts and\r\nexpressions that amid this apparent disorder he lost none of his\r\npresence of mind; but his manner of commanding might have caused others\r\nto lose theirs, and I confess I should have admired his courage more if\r\nhe had kept more quiet.\r\n\r\nThis conflict, in which one saw nobody before him, this firing, which\r\nseemed to be aimed only at the walls, surprised me strangely. I should\r\nnever have pictured war to myself under this aspect. As the boulevard\r\nseemed clear beyond the Chateau-d'Eau, I was unable to understand why\r\nour columns did not pass further, nor why, if we wanted first to seize\r\nthe large house facing the street, we did not capture it at a run,\r\ninstead of remaining so long exposed to the deadly fire issuing from it.\r\nYet nothing was more easily explained: the boulevard, which I thought\r\nclear from the Chateau-d'Eau onwards, was not so; beyond the bend which\r\nit makes at this place, it was bristling with barricades, all the way to\r\nthe Bastille. Before attacking the barricades, we wanted to become\r\nmasters of the streets we left behind us, and especially to capture the\r\nhouse facing the street, which, commanding the boulevard as it did,\r\nwould have impeded our communications. Finally, we did not take the\r\nhouse by assault, because we were separated from it by the canal, which\r\nI could not see from the boulevard. We confined ourselves, therefore, to\r\nefforts to destroy it by cannon-shots, or at least to render it\r\nuntenable. This took a long time to accomplish, and after being\r\nastonished in the morning that the fighting had not finished, I now\r\nasked myself how at this rate it could ever finish. For what I was\r\nwitnessing at the Chateau-d'Eau was at the same time being repeated in\r\nother forms in a hundred different parts of Paris.\r\n\r\nAs the insurgents had no artillery, the conflict did not possess the\r\nhorrible aspect which it must have when the battle-field is ploughed by\r\ncannon balls. The men who were struck down before me seemed transfixed\r\nby an invisible shaft: they staggered and fell without one's seeing at\r\nfirst anything but a little hole made in their clothes. In the cases of\r\nthis kind which I witnessed, I was struck less by the sight of physical\r\npain than by the picture of moral anguish. It was indeed a strange and\r\nfrightful thing to see the sudden change of features, the quick\r\nextinction of the light in the eyes in the terror of death.\r\n\r\nAfter a certain period, I saw Lamoriciere's horse sink to the ground,\r\nshot by a bullet; it was the third horse the General had had killed\r\nunder him since the day before yesterday. He sprang lightly to the\r\nground, and continued bellowing his raging instructions.\r\n\r\nI noticed that on our side the least eager were the soldiers of the\r\nLine. They were weakened and, as it were, dulled by the remembrance of\r\nFebruary, and did not yet seem quite certain that they would not be told\r\nthe next day that they had done wrong. The liveliest were undoubtedly\r\nthe Gardes Mobiles of whom we had felt so uncertain; and, in spite of\r\nthe event, I maintain that we were right, at the time; for it wanted but\r\nlittle for them to decide against us instead of taking our side. Until\r\nthe end, they plainly showed that it was the fighting they loved rather\r\nthan the cause for which they fought.\r\n\r\nAll these troops were raw and very subject to panic: I myself was a\r\njudge and almost a victim of this. At a street corner close to the\r\nChateau-d'Eau was a large house in process of building. Some insurgents,\r\nwho doubtless entered from behind across the court-yards, had taken up\r\ntheir position there, unknown to us; suddenly they appeared on the roof,\r\nand fired a great volley at the troops who filled the boulevard, and who\r\ndid not expect to find the enemy posted so close at hand. The sound of\r\ntheir muskets reverberating with a great crash against the opposite\r\nhouses gave reason to dread that a surprise of the same kind was taking\r\nplace on that side. Immediately the most incredible confusion prevailed\r\nin our column: artillery, cavalry, and infantry were mingled in a\r\nmoment, the soldiers fired in every direction, without knowing what they\r\nwere doing, and tumultuously fell back sixty paces. This retreat was so\r\ndisorderly and so impetuous that I was thrown against the wall of the\r\nhouses facing the Rue du Faubourg-du-Temple, knocked down by the\r\ncavalry, and so hard pressed that I left my hat on the field, and very\r\nnearly left my body there. It was certainly the most serious danger I\r\nran during the days of June. This made me think that it is not all\r\nheroism in the game of war. I have no doubt but that accidents of this\r\nkind often happen to the very best troops; no one boasts about them, and\r\nthey are not mentioned in the despatches.\r\n\r\nIt was now that Lamoriciere became sublime. He had till then kept his\r\nsword in the scabbard: he now drew it, and ran up to his soldiers, his\r\nfeatures distorted with the most magnificent rage; he stopped them with\r\nhis voice, seized them with his hands, even struck them with the pummel\r\nof his sword, turned them, brought them back, and, placing himself at\r\ntheir head, forced them to pass at the trot through the fire in the Rue\r\ndu Faubourg-du-Temple in order to take the house from which the firing\r\nhad come. This was done in a moment, and without striking a blow: the\r\nenemy had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe combat resumed its dull aspect and lasted some time longer, until\r\nthe enemy's fire was at length extinguished, and the street occupied.\r\nBefore commencing the next operation, there was a moment's pause:\r\nLamoriciere went to his head-quarters, a wine-shop on the boulevard near\r\nthe Porte Saint-Martin, and I was at last able to consult him on the\r\nstate of affairs.\r\n\r\n\"How long do you think,\" I asked, \"that all this will last?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how can I tell?\" he replied. \"That depends on the enemy, not on\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nHe then showed me on the map all the streets we had already captured and\r\nwere occupying, and all those we had still to take, adding, \"If the\r\ninsurgents choose to defend themselves on the ground they still hold as\r\nthey have done on that which we have won from them, we may still have a\r\nweek's fighting before us, and our loss will be enormous, for we lose\r\nmore than they do: the first side to lose its moral courage will be the\r\nfirst to be beaten.\"\r\n\r\nI next reproached him with exposing himself so rashly, and, as I\r\nthought, so uselessly.\r\n\r\n\"What will you have me do?\" said he. \"Tell Cavaignac to send generals\r\nable and willing to second me, and I will keep more in the background;\r\nbut you always have to expose yourself when you have only yourself to\r\nrely on.\"\r\n\r\nM. Thiers then came up, threw himself on Lamoriciere's neck, and told\r\nhim he was a hero. I could not help smiling at this effusion, for there\r\nwas no love lost between them: but a great danger is like wine, it makes\r\nmen affectionate.\r\n\r\nI left Lamoriciere in M. Thiers' arms, and returned to the Assembly: it\r\nwas growing late, and besides, I know no greater fool than the man who\r\ngets his head broken in battle out of curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was spent as the day before: the same anxiety in the\r\nAssembly, the same feverish inaction, the same firmness. Volunteers\r\ncontinued to enter Paris; every moment we were told of some tragic event\r\nor illustrious death. These pieces of news saddened, but animated and\r\nfortified, the Assembly. Any member who ventured to propose to enter\r\ninto negociations with the insurgents was met with yells of rage.\r\n\r\nIn the evening I decided to go myself to the Hotel de Ville, in order\r\nthere to obtain more certain news of the results of the day. The\r\ninsurrection, after alarming me by its extreme violence, now alarmed me\r\nby its long duration. For who could foresee the effect which the sight\r\nof so long and uncertain a conflict might produce in some parts of\r\nFrance, and especially in the great manufacturing towns, such as Lyons?\r\nAs I went along the Quai de la Ferraille, I met some National Guards\r\nfrom my neighbourhood, carrying on litters several of their comrades and\r\ntwo of their officers wounded. I observed, in talking with them, with\r\nwhat terrible rapidity, even in so civilized a century as our own, the\r\nmost peaceful minds enter, as it were, into the spirit of civil war, and\r\nhow quick they are, in these unhappy times, to acquire a taste for\r\nviolence and a contempt for human life. The men with whom I was talking\r\nwere peaceful, sober artisans, whose gentle and somewhat sluggish\r\nnatures were still further removed from cruelty than from heroism. Yet\r\nthey dreamt of nothing but massacre and destruction. They complained\r\nthat they were not allowed to use bombs, or to sap and mine the streets\r\nheld by the insurgents, and they were determined to show no more\r\nquarter; already that morning I had almost seen a poor devil shot before\r\nmy eyes on the boulevards, who had been arrested without arms in his\r\nhands, but whose mouth and hands were blackened by a substance which\r\nthey supposed to be, and which no doubt was, powder. I did all I could\r\nto calm these rabid sheep. I promised them that we should take terrible\r\nmeasures the next day. Lamoriciere, in fact, had told me that morning\r\nthat he had sent for shells to hurl behind the barricades; and I knew\r\nthat a regiment of sappers was expected from Douai, to pierce the walls\r\nand blow up the besieged houses with petards. I added that they must not\r\nshoot any of their prisoners, but that they should kill then and there\r\nanyone who made as though to defend himself. I left my men a little more\r\ncontented, and, continuing my road, I could not help examining myself\r\nand feeling surprised at the nature of the arguments I had used, and the\r\npromptness with which, in two days, I had become familiarized with those\r\nideas of inexorable destruction which were naturally so foreign to my\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAs I passed in front of the little streets at the entrance to which, two\r\ndays before, I had seen such neat and solid barricades being built, I\r\nnoticed that the cannon had considerably upset those fine works,\r\nalthough some traces remained.\r\n\r\nI was received by Marrast, the Mayor of Paris. He told me that the Hotel\r\nde Ville was clear for the present, but that the insurgents might try in\r\nthe night to recapture the streets from which we had driven them. I\r\nfound him less tranquil than his bulletins. He took me to a room in\r\nwhich they had laid Bedeau, who was dangerously wounded on the first\r\nday. This post at the Hotel de Ville was a very fatal one for the\r\ngenerals who commanded there. Bedeau almost lost his life. Duvivier and\r\nNegrier, who succeeded him, were killed. Bedeau believed he was but\r\nslightly hurt, and thought only of the situation of affairs:\r\nnevertheless, his activity of mind struck me as ill-omened, and alarmed\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe night was well advanced when I left the Hotel de Ville to go to the\r\nAssembly. I was offered an escort, which I refused, not thinking I\r\nshould require it; but I regretted it more than once on the road. In\r\norder to prevent the insurgent districts from receiving reinforcements,\r\nprovisions, or communications from the other parts of the town, in which\r\nthere were so many men prepared to embrace the same cause, it had very\r\nproperly been resolved absolutely to prohibit circulation in any of the\r\nstreets. Everyone was stopped who left his house without a pass or an\r\nescort. I was constantly stopped on my way and made to show my medal. I\r\nwas aimed at more than ten times by those inexperienced sentries, who\r\nspoke every imaginable brogue; for Paris was filled with provincials,\r\nwho had come from every part of the country, many of them for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived, the sitting was over, but the Palace was still in a\r\ngreat state of excitement. A rumour had got abroad that the workmen of\r\nthe Gros-Caillou were about to take advantage of the darkness to seize\r\nupon the Palace itself. Thus the Assembly, which, after three days'\r\nfighting, had carried the conflict into the heart of the districts\r\noccupied by its enemies, was trembling for its own quarters. The rumour\r\nwas void of foundation; but nothing could better show the character of\r\nthis war, in which the enemy might always be one's own neighbour, and\r\nin which one was never certain of not having his house sacked while\r\ngaining a victory at a distance. In order to secure the Palace against\r\nall surprise, barricades were hurriedly erected at the entrance to all\r\nthe streets leading up to it. When I saw that there was only a question\r\nof a false rumour, I went home to bed.\r\n\r\nI shall say no more of the June combats. The recollections of the two\r\nlast days merge into and are lost in those of the first. As is known,\r\nthe Faubourg Saint-Antoine, the last citadel of the civil war, did not\r\nlay down its arms until the Monday--that is to say, on the fourth day\r\nafter the commencement of the conflict; and it was not until the morning\r\nof that day that the volunteers from la Manche were able to reach Paris.\r\nThey had hurried as fast as possible, but they had come more than eighty\r\nleagues across a country in which there were no railways. They were\r\nfifteen hundred in number. I was touched at recognizing among them many\r\nlandlords, lawyers, doctors and farmers who were my friends and\r\nneighbours. Almost all the old nobility of the country had taken up arms\r\non this occasion and formed part of the column. It was the same over\r\nalmost the whole of France. From the petty squire squatting in his den\r\nin the country to the useless, elegant sons of the great houses--all had\r\nat that moment remembered that they had once formed part of a warlike\r\nand governing class, and on every side they gave the example of vigour\r\nand resolution: so great is the vitality of those old bodies of\r\naristocracy. They retain traces of themselves even when they appear to\r\nbe reduced to dust, and spring up time after time from the shades of\r\ndeath before sinking back for ever.\r\n\r\nIt was in the midst of the days of June that the death occurred of a man\r\nwho perhaps of all men in our day best preserved the spirit of the old\r\nraces: M. de Chateaubriand, with whom I was connected by so many family\r\nties and childish recollections. He had long since fallen into a sort of\r\nspeechless stupor, which made one sometimes believe that his\r\nintelligence was extinguished. Nevertheless, while in this condition, he\r\nheard a rumour of the Revolution of February, and desired to be told\r\nwhat was happening. They informed him that Louis-Philippe's government\r\nhad been overthrown. He said, \"Well done!\" and nothing more. Four months\r\nlater, the din of the days of June reached his ears, and again he asked\r\nwhat that noise was. They answered that people were fighting in Paris,\r\nand that it was the sound of cannon. Thereupon he made vain efforts to\r\nrise, saying, \"I want to go to it,\" and was then silent, this time for\r\never; for he died the next day.\r\n\r\nSuch were the days of June, necessary and disastrous days. They did not\r\nextinguish revolutionary ardour in France, but they put a stop, at least\r\nfor a time, to what may be called the work appertaining to the\r\nRevolution of February. They delivered the nation from the tyranny of\r\nthe Paris workmen and restored it to possession of itself.\r\n\r\nSocialistic theories continued to penetrate into the minds of the people\r\nin the shape of envious and greedy desires, and to sow the seed of\r\nfuture revolutions; but the socialist party itself was beaten and\r\npowerless. The Montagnards, who did not belong to it, felt that they\r\nwere irrevocably affected by the blow that had struck it. The moderate\r\nRepublicans themselves did not fail to be alarmed lest this victory had\r\nled them to a slope which might precipitate them from the Republic, and\r\nthey made an immediate effort to stop their descent, but in vain.\r\nPersonally I detested the Mountain, and was indifferent to the Republic;\r\nbut I adored Liberty, and I conceived great apprehensions for it\r\nimmediately after these days. I at once looked upon the June fighting as\r\na necessary crisis, after which, however, the temper of the nation would\r\nundergo a certain change. The love of independence was to be followed by\r\na dread of, and perhaps a distaste for, free institutions; after such an\r\nabuse of liberty a return of this sort was inevitable. This retrograde\r\nmovement began, in fact, on the 27th of June. At first very slow and\r\ninvisible, as it were, to the naked eye, it grew swifter, impetuous,\r\nirresistible. Where will it stop? I do not know. I believe we shall have\r\ngreat difficulty in not rolling far beyond the point we had reached\r\nbefore February, and I foresee that all of us, Socialists, Montagnards\r\nand Liberal Republicans, will fall into common discredit until the\r\nprivate recollections of the Revolution of 1848 are removed and effaced,\r\nand the general spirit of the times shall resume its empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI[12]\r\n\r\n     THE COMMITTEE FOR THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n     [12: There is a great hiatus in this chapter, due to my not\r\n     mentioning the discussions and resolutions relating to _general\r\n     principles_. Many of the discussions were fairly thorough, and most\r\n     of the resolutions were tolerably wise and even courageous. Most of\r\n     the revolutionary and socialistic raptures of the time were\r\n     combated in them. We were prepared and on our guard on these\r\n     general questions.]\r\n\r\n\r\nI now change my subject, and am glad to leave the scenes of the civil\r\nwar and to return to the recollections of my parliamentary life. I wish\r\nto speak of what happened in the Committee for the Constitution, of\r\nwhich I was a member. This will oblige us to retrace our steps a little,\r\nfor the appointment and work of this committee date back to before the\r\ndays of June; but I did not mention it earlier, because I did not wish\r\nto interrupt the course of events which was leading us swiftly and\r\ndirectly to those days. The nomination of the Committee for the\r\nConstitution was commenced on the 17th of May; it was a long\r\nperformance, because it had been decided that the members of the\r\ncommittee should be chosen by the whole Assembly and by an absolute\r\nmajority of votes. I was elected at the first time of voting[13]\r\ntogether with Cormenin, Marrast, Lamennais, Vivien, and Dufaure. I do\r\nnot know how often the voting had to be repeated in order to complete\r\nthe list, which was to consist of eighteen members.\r\n\r\n     [13: I received 496 votes.]\r\n\r\nAlthough the committee had been nominated before the victory of June,\r\nalmost all its members belonged to the different moderate sections of\r\nthe Assembly. The Mountain had only two representatives on it: Lamennais\r\nand Considerant; and even these were little worse than chimerical\r\nvisionaries, especially Considerant, who would have deserved to be sent\r\nto a lunatic asylum had he been sincere--but I fear he deserved more\r\nthan that.\r\n\r\nTaking the Committee as a whole, it was easy to see that no very\r\nremarkable result was to be expected from it. Some of its members had\r\nspent their lives in conducting or controlling the administration during\r\nthe last government. They had never seen, studied, or understood\r\nanything except the Monarchy; and even then they had, for the most part,\r\napplied rather than studied its principles. They had raised themselves\r\nbut little above the practice of business. Now that they were called\r\nupon to realize the theories which they had always slighted or opposed,\r\nand which had defeated without convincing them, they found it difficult\r\nto apply any but monarchical ideas to their work; or, if they adopted\r\nrepublican ideas, they did so now timidly, now rashly, always a little\r\nat hap-hazard, like novices.\r\n\r\nAs for the Republicans proper on the Committee, they had few ideas of\r\nany sort, except those which they had gathered in reading or writing for\r\nthe newspapers; for there were many journalists among them. Marrast had\r\nedited the _National_ for ten years; Dornes was at that time its\r\neditor-in-chief; Vaulabelle, a man of serious but coarse and even\r\ncynical cast of mind, habitually wrote for its columns. He was the man\r\nwho, a month later, was himself vastly astonished at becoming Minister\r\nof Public Worship and Instruction.\r\n\r\nAll this bore very little resemblance to the men, so certain of their\r\nobjects and so well acquainted with the measures necessary to attain\r\nthem, who sixty years before, under Washington's presidency so\r\nsuccessfully drew up the American Constitution.\r\n\r\nFor that matter, even if the Committee had been capable of doing its\r\nwork well, the want of time and the preoccupation of outside events\r\nwould have prevented it.\r\n\r\nThere is no nation which attaches itself less to those who govern it\r\nthan the French Nation, nor which is less able to dispense with\r\ngovernment. So soon as it finds itself obliged to walk alone, it\r\nundergoes a sort of vertigo, which makes it dread an abyss at every\r\nstep. At the time I speak of, it had a sort of frenzied desire for the\r\nwork of framing the Constitution to be completed, and for the powers in\r\ncommand to be, if not solidly, at least permanently and regularly\r\nestablished. The Assembly shared this eagerness, and never ceased urging\r\nus on, although we required but little urging. The recollection of the\r\n15th of May, the apprehensions entertained of the days of June and the\r\nsight of the divided, enervated and incapable government at the head of\r\naffairs were sufficient inducement to us to hasten our labours. But what\r\nespecially deprived the Committee of its freedom of thought was, it must\r\nbe confessed, the fear of outside matters and the excitement of the\r\nmoment. It would be difficult to imagine the effect produced by this\r\nforcing of revolutionary ideas upon minds so little disposed to adopt\r\nthem, and how the latter were being incessantly, and even almost\r\nunconsciously, impelled much further than they wished to go, when they\r\nwere not pushed altogether out of the direction they desired to take.\r\nCertainly, if the Committee had met on the 27th of June instead of the\r\n16th of May, its work would have been very different.\r\n\r\nThe discussion opened on the 22nd of May. The first question was to\r\ndecide on which side we should tackle this immense work. Lamennais\r\nproposed to commence by regulating the state of the communes. He had\r\nproceeded in this way himself in a proposal for a Constitution which he\r\nhad just published, so as to make certain of the first fruits of his\r\ndiscoveries. Then he passed from the question of sequence to that of the\r\nmain point: he began to talk of administrative centralization, for his\r\nthoughts were incapable of sub-dividing themselves; his mind was always\r\nwholly occupied by a single system, and all the ideas contained in it\r\nadhered so closely together that, so soon as one was uttered, the others\r\nseemed necessarily to follow. He therefore explained that a Republic\r\nwhose citizens are not clever and experienced enough to govern\r\nthemselves was a monster not fit to live.\r\n\r\nThereupon the Committee took fire: Barrot, who, amid the clouds of his\r\nmind, always pretty clearly perceived the necessity for local liberty,\r\neagerly supported Lamennais. I did the same; Marrast and Vivien opposed\r\nus. Vivien was quite consistent in defending centralization, for the\r\nmovement of administrative affairs was his profession, and moreover he\r\nwas quite naturally drawn towards it. He had all the qualities of a\r\nclever legist and an excellent commentator, and none of those necessary\r\nto a legislator or statesman. The danger in which he beheld the\r\ninstitutions so dear to him inflamed him; he grew so excited that he\r\nbegan to hold that the Republic, far from restraining centralization,\r\nought even to increase it. One would have said that this was the side on\r\nwhich the Revolution of February pleased him.\r\n\r\nMarrast belonged to the ordinary type of French revolutionaries, who\r\nhave always understood the liberty of the people to mean despotism\r\nexercised in the name of the people. This sudden harmony between Vivien\r\nand Marrast did not, therefore, surprise me. I was used to the\r\nphenomenon, and I had long remarked that the only way to bring a\r\nConservative and a Radical together was to attack the power of the\r\ncentral government, not in application, but in principle. One was then\r\nsure of throwing them into each other's arms.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, people assert that nothing is safe from revolutions, I\r\ntell them they are wrong, and that centralization is one of those\r\nthings. In France there is only one thing we can't set up: that is, a\r\nfree government; and only one institution we can't destroy: that is,\r\ncentralization. How could it ever perish? The enemies of government love\r\nit, and those who govern cherish it. The latter perceive, it is true,\r\nfrom time to time, that it exposes them to sudden and irremediable\r\ndisasters; but this does not disgust them with it. The pleasure it\r\nprocures them of interfering with every one and holding everything in\r\ntheir hands atones to them for its dangers. They prefer this agreeable\r\nlife to a more certain and longer existence, and say, \"_Courte et\r\nbonne_\" like the _roues_ of the Regency: \"A short life and a merry one.\"\r\n\r\nThe question could not be decided that day; but it was settled in\r\nadvance by the determination arrived at that we should not first occupy\r\nourselves with the communal system.\r\n\r\nNext day, Lamennais resigned. Under the circumstances, an occurrence of\r\nthis sort was annoying. It was bound to increase and rooten the\r\nprejudices already existing against us. We took very pressing and even\r\nsomewhat humble steps to induce Lamennais to reconsider his resolve. As\r\nI had shared his opinion, I was deputed to go and see him and press him\r\nto return. I did so, but in vain. He had only been beaten over a formal\r\nquestion, but he had concluded from this that he would not be the\r\nmaster. That was enough to decide him to be nothing at all. He was\r\ninflexible, in spite of all I could say in the interest of the very\r\nideas which we held in common.\r\n\r\nOne should especially consider an unfrocked priest if one wishes to\r\nacquire a correct idea of the indestructible and, so to speak, infinite\r\npower which the clerical habit and method of thought wield over those\r\nwho have once contracted them. It was useless for Lamennais to sport\r\nwhite stockings, a yellow waistcoat, a striped necktie, and a green\r\ncoat: he remained a priest in character, and even in appearance. He\r\nwalked with short, hurried and discreet steps, never turning his head or\r\nlooking at anybody, and glided through the crowd with an awkward, modest\r\nair, as though he were leaving the sacristy. Add to this a pride great\r\nenough to walk over the heads of kings and bid defiance to God.\r\n\r\nWhen it was found that Lamennais' obstinacy was not to be overcome, we\r\nproceeded with other business; and so that no more time might be lost in\r\npremature discussions, a sub-committee was appointed to draw up rules\r\nfor the regulation of our labours, and to propose them to the Committee.\r\nUnfortunately, this sub-committee was so constituted that Cormenin, our\r\nchairman, was its master and, in reality, substituted himself for it.\r\nThe permanent power of initiative which he thus possessed, coupled with\r\nthe conduct of the debates which belonged to him as chairman, had the\r\nmost baneful influence upon our deliberations, and I am not sure if the\r\nfaults in our work should not be mainly attributed to him.\r\n\r\nLike Lamennais, Cormenin had drawn up and published a Constitution after\r\nhis own idea, and again, like the former, he expected us to adopt it.\r\nBut he did not quite know how to put it to us. As a rule, extreme vanity\r\nmakes the timidest very bold in speaking. Cormenin's did not permit him\r\nto open his mouth so soon as he had three listeners. He would have liked\r\nto do as one of my neighbours in Normandy did, a great lover of\r\npolemics, to whom Providence had refused the capacity of disputing _viva\r\nvoce_. Whenever I opposed any of his opinions, he would hurry home and\r\nwrite to me all that he ought to have told me. Cormenin accordingly\r\ndespaired of convincing us, but hoped to surprise us. He flattered\r\nhimself that he would make us accept his system gradually and, so to\r\nspeak, unknown to ourselves, by presenting a morsel to us every day. He\r\nmanaged so cleverly that a general discussion could never be held upon\r\nthe Constitution as a whole, and that even in each case it was almost\r\nimpossible to trace back and find the primitive idea. He brought us\r\nevery day five or six clauses ready drawn up, and patiently, little by\r\nlittle, drew back to this little plot of ground all those who wished to\r\nescape from it. We resisted sometimes; but in the end, from sheer\r\nweariness, we yielded to this gentle, continuous restraint. The\r\ninfluence of a chairman upon the work of a committee is immense; any one\r\nwho has closely observed these little assemblies will understand what I\r\nmean. Nevertheless, it must be admitted that if several of us had\r\ndesired to withdraw ourselves from this tyranny, we should have ended by\r\ncoming to an understanding and succeeding. But we had no time and no\r\ninclination for long discussions. The vastness and complexity of the\r\nsubject alarmed and wearied the minds of the Committee beforehand: the\r\nmajority had not even attempted to study it, or had only collected some\r\nvery confused ideas; and those who had formed clearer ones were ill at\r\nease at having to expound them. They were afraid, besides, lest they\r\nshould enter into violent, interminable disputes if they endeavoured to\r\nget to the bottom of things; and they preferred to appear to be in\r\nharmony by keeping to the surface. In this way we ambled along to the\r\nend, adopting great principles explicitly for reasons of petty detail,\r\nand little by little building up the whole machinery of government\r\nwithout properly taking into account the relative strength of the\r\nvarious wheels and the manner in which they would work together.\r\n\r\nIn the moments of repose which interrupted this fine work, Marrast, who\r\nwas a Republican of the Barras type, and who had always preferred the\r\npleasures of luxury, the table and women to democracy in rags, told us\r\nlittle stories of gallantry, while Vaulabelle made broad jests. I hope,\r\nfor the honour of the Committee, that no one will ever publish the\r\nminutes (very badly done, for that matter) which the secretary drew up\r\nof our sittings. The sterility of the discussions amid the exuberant\r\nfecundity of the subject-matter would assuredly provoke surprise. As for\r\nmyself, I declare that I never witnessed a more wretched display in any\r\ncommittee on which I ever sat.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there was one serious discussion. It referred to the\r\nsystem of a single Chamber. As a matter of fact, the two parties into\r\nwhich the Committee was silently divided only came to an issue on this\r\none occasion. It was even less a question of the two Chambers than of\r\nthe general character to be given to the new government: Were we to\r\npersevere in the learned and somewhat complicated system of\r\ncounterpoises, and place powers held in check, and consequently prudent\r\nand moderate, at the head of the Republic? Or were we to adopt the\r\ncontrary course and accept the simpler theory, according to which\r\naffairs are placed in the hands of a single power, homogeneous in all\r\nits parts, uncontrolled, and consequently impetuous in its measures, and\r\nirresistible? This was the subject-matter of the debate. This general\r\nquestion might have cropped up as the result of a number of other\r\nclauses; but it was better contained than elsewhere in the special\r\nquestion of the two Chambers.\r\n\r\nThe struggle was a long one and lasted for two sittings. The result was\r\nnot for a moment in doubt; for public opinion had pronounced strongly in\r\nfavour of a single Chamber, not only in Paris but in nearly every\r\ndepartment. Barrot was the first to speak in favour of the two Chambers;\r\nhe took up my thesis and developed it with great talent, but\r\nintemperately; for during the Revolution of February, his mind had lost\r\nits equilibrium and had never since been able to recover its\r\nself-possession. I supported Barrot and returned time after time to the\r\ncharge. I was a little surprised to hear Dufaure pronouncing against us\r\nand doing so with a certain eagerness. Lawyers are rarely able to escape\r\nfrom one of two habits: they accustom themselves either to plead what\r\nthey do not believe or to persuade themselves very easily of what they\r\nwish to plead. Dufaure came under the latter category. The drift of\r\npublic opinion, of his own passions or interest, would never have led\r\nhim to embrace a cause which he thought a bad one; but it prompted him\r\nwith a desire to think it a good one, and that was often sufficient. His\r\nnaturally vacillating, ingenious and subtle mind turned gradually\r\ntowards it; and he sometimes ended by adopting it, not only with\r\nconviction but with transport. How often have I not been amazed to see\r\nhim vehemently defending theories which I had seen him adopt with\r\ninfinite hesitation!\r\n\r\nHis principal reason for voting this time in favour of a single Chamber\r\nin the Legislative Body (and it was the best, I think, that could be\r\nfound) was that, with us, the Executive Power wielded by one man\r\nelected by the people would most certainly become preponderant if there\r\nwere placed beside him only a legislative body weakened by being divided\r\ninto two branches. I remember that I replied that that might be the\r\ncase, but that one thing was quite certain, and that was, that two great\r\npowers naturally jealous of one another, and placed in an eternal\r\n_tete-a-tete_ (that was the expression I used), without ever having\r\nrecourse to the arbitrament of a third power, would at once be on bad\r\nterms or at war with one another, and would constantly remain so until\r\none had destroyed the other. I added that, if it was true that a\r\nPresident elected by the people, and possessing the immense prerogatives\r\nwhich in France belong to the chief of the public administration, was\r\nsometimes able to curb a divided legislative body, a President who\r\nshould feel himself to possess this origin and these rights would always\r\nrefuse to become a simple agent and to submit to the capricious and\r\ntyrannical will of a single assembly.\r\n\r\nWe were both in the right. The problem, thus propounded, was insolvable;\r\nbut the nation propounded it thus. To allow the President the same power\r\nthat the King had enjoyed, and to have him elected by the people, would\r\nmake the Republic impossible. As I said later, one must either\r\ninfinitely narrow the sphere of his power, or else have him elected by\r\nthe Assembly; but the nation would hear of neither one nor the other.\r\n\r\nDupin completed our defeat: he defended the single Chamber with\r\nsurprising vigour. One would have thought that he had never held another\r\nopinion. I expected as much. I knew him to possess a heart that was\r\nhabitually self-interested and cowardly, though subject at times to\r\nsudden leaps of courage and honesty. I had seen him for ten years\r\nprowling round every party without joining any, and attacking all the\r\nvanquished: half ape and half jackal, constantly biting, grimacing,\r\ngambolling, and always ready to fall upon the wretch who slipped. He\r\nshowed himself in his true colours on the Committee of the Constitution,\r\nor rather he surpassed himself. I perceived in him none of those sudden\r\nleaps of which I have just spoken: he was uniformly commonplace from\r\nbeginning to end. He usually remained silent while the majority were\r\nmaking up their minds; but as soon as he saw them pronounce in favour of\r\ndemocratic opinions, he rushed to place himself at their head, and often\r\nwent far beyond them. Once, he perceived, when he had gone half-way,\r\nthat the majority were not going in the direction he had thought;\r\nwhereupon he immediately stopped short with a prompt and nimble effort\r\nof the intelligence, turned round, and hurried back at the same run\r\ntowards the opinion from which he had been departing.\r\n\r\nAlmost all the old members of Parliament pronounced in this way against\r\nthe dual Chamber. Most of them sought for more or less plausible\r\npretexts for their votes. Some pretended that a Council of State would\r\nprovide the counterpoise of which they acknowledged the necessity;\r\nothers purposed to subject the single assembly to forms whose slowness\r\nwould safeguard it against its own impulses and against surprise; but in\r\nthe end the true reason was always given. On the committee was a\r\nminister of the Gospel, M. Coquerel, who, seeing that his colleagues of\r\nthe Catholic clergy were entering the Assembly, wanted to appear there\r\ntoo, and he was wrong: from the much-admired preacher that he was, he\r\nsuddenly transformed himself into a very ridiculous political orator. He\r\ncould hardly open his mouth without uttering some pompous absurdity. On\r\nthis occasion he was so naive as to inform us that he continued to\r\nfavour the dual Chamber, but that he would vote for the single Chamber\r\nbecause public opinion was pushing him on, and he did not wish, to use\r\nhis own words, to fight against the current. This candour greatly\r\nannoyed those who were acting as he did, and mightily delighted Barrot\r\nand myself; but this was the only satisfaction we received, for, when it\r\ncame to voting, there were only three on our side.\r\n\r\nThis signal defeat disinclined me a little to continue the struggle, and\r\nthrew Barrot quite out of humour. He no longer appeared except at rare\r\nintervals, and in order to utter signs of impatience or disdain rather\r\nthan opinions.\r\n\r\nWe passed on to the Executive Power. In spite of all that I have said\r\nof the circumstances of the time and the disposition of the Committee,\r\nit will still be believed with difficulty that so vast, so perplexing,\r\nso novel a subject did not furnish the material for a single general\r\ndebate, nor for any very profound discussion.\r\n\r\nAll were unanimous in the opinion that the Executive Power should be\r\nentrusted to one man alone. But what prerogatives and what agents should\r\nhe be given, what responsibilities laid upon him? Clearly, none of these\r\nquestions could be treated in an arbitrary fashion; each of them was\r\nnecessarily in connection with all the others, and could, above all, be\r\nonly decided by taking into special account the habits and customs of\r\nthe country. These were old problems, no doubt; but they were made young\r\nagain by the novelty of the circumstances.\r\n\r\nCormenin, according to his custom, opened the discussion by proposing a\r\nlittle clause all ready drawn up, which provided that the head of the\r\nExecutive Power, or the President, as he was thenceforward called,\r\nshould be elected directly by the people by a relative majority, the\r\nminimum of votes necessary to carry his election being fixed at two\r\nmillions. I believe Marrast was the only one to oppose it; he proposed\r\nthat the head of the Executive Power should be elected by the Assembly:\r\nhe was at that time intoxicated with his own fortune, and flattered\r\nhimself, strange though this may seem to-day, that the choice of the\r\nAssembly would fall upon himself. Nevertheless, the clause proposed by\r\nCormenin was adopted without any difficulty, so far as I can remember;\r\nand yet it must be confessed that the expediency of having the President\r\nelected by the people was not a self-evident truth, and that the\r\ndisposition to have him elected directly was as new as it was dangerous.\r\nIn a country with no monarchical tradition, in which the Executive Power\r\nhas always been feeble and continues to be very limited, nothing is\r\nwiser than to charge the nation with the choice of its representative. A\r\nPresident who had not the strength which he could draw from that origin\r\nwould then become the plaything of the Assemblies; but with us the\r\nconditions of the problem were very different. We were emerging from the\r\nMonarchy, and the habits of the Republicans themselves were still\r\nmonarchical. Moreover, our system of centralization made our position an\r\nunique one: according to its principles, the whole administration of the\r\ncountry, in matters of the greatest and of the smallest moment, belonged\r\nto the President; the thousands of officials who held the whole country\r\nin their hands were dependent upon him alone; this was so according to\r\nthe laws, and even the ideas, which the 24th of February had allowed to\r\ncontinue in force; for we had retained the spirit of the Monarchy, while\r\nlosing the taste for it. Under these conditions, what could a President\r\nelected by the people be other than a pretender to the Crown? The office\r\ncould only suit those who hoped to make use of it in order to assist in\r\ntransforming the Presidential into Royal powers; it seemed clear to me\r\nthen, and it seems evident to me now, that if it was desired that the\r\nPresident should be elected by the people without danger to the\r\nRepublic, it was necessary to limit prodigiously the circle of his\r\nprerogatives; and even then, I am not sure that this would have\r\nsufficed, for his sphere, although thus confined in point of law, would,\r\nin habit and remembrance, have preserved its former extent. If, on the\r\nother hand, the President was allowed to retain his power, he should not\r\nbe elected by the people. These truths were not put forward; I doubt\r\nwhether they were even perceived in the heart of the Committee. However,\r\nCormenin's clause, although adopted at first, was later made the object\r\nof a very lively attack; but it was attacked for reasons different to\r\nthose I have just given. It was on the day after the 4th of June. Prince\r\nLouis Napoleon, of whom no one had thought a few days before, had just\r\nbeen elected to the Assembly by Paris and three departments. They began\r\nto fear that he would be placed at the head of the Republic if the\r\nchoice were left to the people. The various pretenders and their friends\r\ngrew excited, the question was raised afresh in the Committee, and the\r\nmajority persisted in its original vote.\r\n\r\nI remember that, during all the time that the Committee was occupied in\r\nthis way, my mind was labouring to divine to which side the balance of\r\npower would most generally lean in a Republic of the kind which I saw\r\nthey were going to make. Sometimes I thought that it would be on the\r\nside of the Assembly, and then again on that of the elected President;\r\nand this uncertainty made me very uneasy. The fact is, that it was\r\nimpossible to tell beforehand. The victory of one or other of these two\r\ngreat rivals must necessarily depend upon circumstances and the humours\r\nof the moment. There were only two things certain: the war which they\r\nwould wage together, and the eventual ruin of the Republic.\r\n\r\nOf all the ideas which I have expounded, not one was sifted by the\r\nCommittee; I might even say that not one was discussed. Barrot one day\r\ntouched upon them in passing, but did not linger over them. His mind\r\n(which was sleepy rather than feeble, and which was even able to see far\r\nahead when it took the trouble to look) caught a glimpse of them, as it\r\nwere, between sleeping and waking, and thought no more of them.\r\n\r\nI myself only pointed them out with a certain hesitation and reserve. My\r\nrebuff in the matter of the dual Chamber left me little heart for the\r\nfight. Moreover, I confess, I was more anxious to reach a quick\r\ndecision, and place a powerful leader at the head of the Republic, than\r\nto organize a perfect republican Constitution. We were then under the\r\ndivided and uncertain government of the Executive Committee, Socialism\r\nwas at our gates, and we were approaching the days of June, as we must\r\nnot forget. Later, after these days, I vigorously supported in the\r\nAssembly the system of electing the President by the people, and in a\r\ncertain measure contributed to its acceptance. The principal reason\r\nwhich I gave was that, after announcing to the nation that we would\r\ngrant it that right, which it had always ardently desired, it was no\r\nlonger possible to withhold it. This was true. Nevertheless, I regret\r\nhaving spoken on this occasion.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Committee: unable and even unwilling to oppose the\r\nadoption of the principle, I endeavoured at least to make its\r\napplication less dangerous. I first proposed to limit in various\r\ndirections the sphere of the Executive Power; but I soon saw that it was\r\nuseless to attempt anything serious on that side. I then fell back upon\r\nthe method of election itself, and raised a discussion on that portion\r\nof Cormenin's clause which treated of it.\r\n\r\nThe clause, as I said above, laid down that the President should be\r\nelected directly, by a relative majority, the minimum of this majority\r\nbeing fixed at two million votes. This method had several very serious\r\ndrawbacks.\r\n\r\nSince the President was to be elected directly by the citizens, the\r\nenthusiasm and infatuation of the people was very much to be feared; and\r\nmoreover, the prestige and moral power which the newly elected would\r\npossess would be much greater. Since a relative majority was to be\r\nsufficient to make the election valid, it might be possible that the\r\nPresident should only represent the wishes of a minority of the nation.\r\nI asked that the President might not be elected directly by the\r\ncitizens, but that this should be entrusted to delegates whom the people\r\nwould elect. In the second place, I proposed to substitute an actual for\r\na relative majority; if an absolute majority was not obtained at the\r\nfirst vote, it would fall to the Assembly to make a choice. These ideas\r\nwere, I think, sound, but they were not new; I had borrowed them from\r\nthe American Constitution. I doubt whether anyone would have suspected\r\nthis, had I not said so; so little was the Committee prepared to play\r\nits great part.\r\n\r\nThe first part of my amendment was rejected. I expected this: our great\r\nmen were of opinion that this system was not sufficiently simple, and\r\nthey considered it tainted with a touch of aristocracy. The second was\r\naccepted, and is part of the actual Constitution.\r\n\r\nBeaumont proposed that the President should not be re-eligible; I\r\nsupported him vigorously, and the proposal was carried. On this occasion\r\nwe both fell into a great mistake which will, I fear, lead to very sad\r\nresults. We had always been greatly struck with the dangers threatening\r\nliberty and public morality at the hands of a re-eligible president, who\r\nin order to secure his re-election would infallibly employ beforehand\r\nthe immense resources of constraint and corruption which our laws and\r\ncustoms allow to the head of the Executive Power. Our minds were not\r\nsupple or prompt enough to turn in time or to see that, so soon as it\r\nwas decided that the citizens themselves should directly choose the\r\nPresident, the evil was irreparable, and that it would be only\r\nincreasing it rashly to undertake to hinder the people in their choice.\r\nThis vote, and the great influence I brought to bear upon it, is my most\r\nunpleasant memory of that period.\r\n\r\nEach moment we came up against centralization, and instead of removing\r\nthe obstacle, we stumbled over it. It was of the essence of the Republic\r\nthat the head of the Executive Power should be responsible; but\r\nresponsible for what, and to what extent? Could he be made responsible\r\nfor the thousand details of administration with which our administrative\r\nlegislation is overcharged, and over which it would be impossible, and\r\nmoreover dangerous, for him to watch in person? That would have been\r\nunjust and ridiculous; and if he was not to be responsible for the\r\nadministration proper, who would be? It was decided that the\r\nresponsibility of the President should be shared by the ministers, and\r\nthat their counter-signature should be necessary, as in the days of the\r\nMonarchy. Thus the President was responsible, and yet he was not\r\nentirely free in his own actions, and he was not able to protect his\r\nagents in agents.\r\n\r\nWe passed to the constitution of the Council of State. Cormenin and\r\nVivien took charge of this; it may be said that they set to work like\r\npeople who are building up a house for themselves. They did their utmost\r\nto make the Council of State a third power, but without success. It\r\nbecame something more than an administrative council, but infinitely\r\nless than a legislative assembly.\r\n\r\nThe only part of our work which was at all well thought out, and\r\narranged, as I think, with wisdom, was that which related to justice.\r\nHere the committee felt at home, most of its members being, or having\r\nbeen, barristers. Thanks to these, we were able to save the principle of\r\nthe irremovability of the judges; as in 1830, it held good against the\r\ncurrent which swept away all the rest. Those who had been Republicans\r\nfrom the commencement attacked it nevertheless, and very stupidly, in my\r\nopinion; for this principle is much more in favour of the independence\r\nof one's fellow-citizens than of the power of those who govern. The\r\nCourt of Appeal and, especially, the tribunal charged with judging\r\npolitical crimes were constituted at once just as they are to-day\r\n(1851). Beaumont drew up most of the articles which refer to these two\r\ngreat courts. What we did in these matters is far in advance of all that\r\nhad been attempted in the same direction during sixty years. It is\r\nprobably the only part of the Constitution of 1848 which will survive.\r\n\r\nIt was decided at the instance of Vivien that the Constitution could\r\nonly be revised by a Constituent Assembly, which was right; but they\r\nadded that this revision could only take place if the National Assembly\r\ndemanded it by an express vote, given three times consecutively by a\r\nmajority of four-fifths, which rendered any regular revision almost\r\nimpossible. I took no part in this vote. I had long been of opinion\r\nthat, instead of aiming to make our governments eternal, we should tend\r\nto make it possible to change them in an easy and regular manner. Taken\r\nall round, I thought this less dangerous than the opposite course; and I\r\nthought it best to treat the French people like those madmen whom one\r\nshould be careful not to bind lest they become infuriated by the\r\nrestraint.\r\n\r\nI noticed casually a number of curious opinions that were emitted.\r\nMartin (of Strasburg), who, not content with being a Republican of\r\nyesterday, one day declared so absurdly in the tribune that he was a\r\nRepublican by birth, nevertheless proposed to give the President the\r\nright to dissolve the Assembly, and failed to see that a right of this\r\nkind would easily make him master of the Republic; Marrast wanted a\r\nsection to be added to the Council of State charged to elaborate \"new\r\nideas,\" to be called a section of progress; Barrot proposed to leave to\r\na jury the decision of all civil suits, as though a judiciary revolution\r\nof this sort could possibly be improvised. And Dufaure proposed to\r\nprohibit substitution in the conscription, and to compel everyone\r\npersonally to perform his military service, a measure which would have\r\ndestroyed all liberal education unless the time of service had been\r\ngreatly reduced, or have disorganized the army if this reduction had\r\nbeen effected.\r\n\r\nIn this way, pressed by time and ill prepared to treat such important\r\nsubjects, we approached the time appointed for the end of our labours.\r\nWhat was said was: Let us adopt, in the meantime, the articles proposed\r\nto us; we can afterwards retrace our steps; we can judge from this\r\nsketch how to fix the definitive features and to adjust the portions\r\namong themselves. But we did not retrace our steps, and the sketch\r\nremained the picture.\r\n\r\nWe appointed Marrast our secretary. The way in which he acquitted\r\nhimself of this important office soon exposed the mixture of idleness,\r\ngiddiness and impudence which formed the basis of his character. He was\r\nfirst several days without doing anything, though the Assembly was\r\nconstantly asking to know the result of our deliberations, and all\r\nFrance was anxiously awaiting to learn it. Then he hurriedly wrote his\r\nreport in one night immediately preceding the day on which he was to\r\ncommunicate it to the Assembly. In the morning, he spoke of it to one or\r\ntwo of his colleagues whom he met by chance, and then boldly appeared in\r\nthe tribune and read, in the name of the Committee, a report of which\r\nhardly one of its members had heard a single word. This reading took\r\nplace on the 19th of June. The draft of the Constitution contained one\r\nhundred and thirty-nine articles; it had been drawn up in less than a\r\nmonth. We could not have been quicker, but we might have done better. We\r\nhad adopted many of the little articles which Cormenin had brought us in\r\nturns; but we had rejected a yet greater number, which caused their\r\nauthor an irritation, which was so much the greater in that he had never\r\nhad an opportunity of giving vent to it. He turned to the public for\r\nconsolation. He published, or caused to be published, I forget which it\r\nwas, in all the newspapers an article in which he related what had\r\npassed in the Committee, attributing all the good it had done to M. de\r\nCormenin, and all the harm to his adversaries. A publication of this\r\nsort displeased us greatly, as may be imagined; and it was decided to\r\nacquaint Cormenin with the feeling inspired by his procedure. But no one\r\ncared to be the spokesman of the company.\r\n\r\nWe had among us a workman (for in those days they put workmen into\r\neverything) called Corbon, a tolerably right-minded man of firm\r\ncharacter. He readily undertook the task. On the next morning,\r\ntherefore, so soon as the sitting of the Committee had opened, Corbon\r\nstood up and, with cruel simplicity and conciseness, gave Cormenin to\r\nunderstand what we thought. Cormenin grew confused, and cast his eyes\r\nround the table to see if anybody would come to his aid. Nobody moved.\r\nHe then said, in a hesitating voice, \"Am I to conclude from what has\r\njust happened that the Committee wishes me to leave it?\" We made no\r\nreply. He took his hat and went, without anyone interfering. Never was\r\nso great an outrage swallowed with less effort or grimace. I believe\r\nthat, although enormously vain, he was not very sensitive to insults in\r\nsecret; and as long as his self-love was well tickled in public, he\r\nwould not have made many bones about receiving a few cuffs in private.\r\n\r\nMany have believed that Cormenin, who from a viscount had suddenly\r\nbecome a Radical, while remaining a devout Catholic, never ceased to\r\nplay a part and to betray his opinions. I would not venture to say that\r\nthis was the case, although I have often observed strange\r\ninconsistencies between the things he said when talking and those he\r\nwrote; and to tell the truth, he always seemed to me to be more sincere\r\nin the dread he entertained of revolutions than in the opinions he had\r\nborrowed from them. What always especially struck me in him was the\r\nshortcomings of his mind. No writer ever to a greater extent preserved\r\nin public business the habits and peculiarities of that calling. When he\r\nhad established a certain agreement between the different clauses of a\r\nlaw and drawn it up in a certain ingenious and striking manner, he\r\nthought he had done all that was necessary: he was absorbed in questions\r\nof form, of symmetry, and cohesion.\r\n\r\nBut what he especially sought for was novelty. Institutions which had\r\nalready been tried elsewhere or elsewhen seemed to him as hateful as\r\ncommonplaces, and the first merit of a law in his eyes was to resemble\r\nin no way that which had preceded it. It is known that the law laying\r\ndown the Constitution was his work. At the time of the General Election\r\nI met him and he said, with a certain complacency, \"Has anything in the\r\nworld ever been seen like what is seen to-day? Where is the country that\r\nhas gone so far as to give votes to servants, paupers and soldiers?\r\nConfess that no one ever thought of it before.\" And rubbing his hands,\r\nhe added, \"It will be very curious to see the result.\" He spoke of it as\r\nthough it were an experiment in chemistry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART THE THIRD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_MY TERM OF OFFICE_\r\n\r\n     _This part was commenced at Versailles on the 16th of September\r\n     1851, during the prorogation of the National Assembly._\r\n\r\n     _To come at once to this part of my recollections, I pass over the\r\n     previous period, which extends from the end of the days of June\r\n     1848 to the 3rd of June 1849. I return to it later if I have time.\r\n     I have thought it more important, while my recollections are still\r\n     fresh in my mind, to recall the five months during which I was a\r\n     member of the Government._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n     MY RETURN TO FRANCE--FORMATION OF THE CABINET.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus occupied in witnessing upon the private stage of\r\nGermany one act of the great drama of the European Revolution, my\r\nattention was suddenly drawn towards France and fixed upon our affairs\r\nby unexpected and alarming news. I heard of the almost incredible check\r\nreceived by our army beneath the walls of Rome, the violent debates\r\nwhich followed in the Constituent Assembly, the excitement produced\r\nthroughout the country by these two causes, and lastly, the General\r\nElection, whose result deceived the expectations of both parties and\r\nbrought over one hundred and fifty Montagnards into the new Assembly.\r\nHowever, the demagogic wind which had suddenly blown over a part of\r\nFrance had not prevailed in the Department of la Manche. All the former\r\nmembers for the department who had separated from the Conservative Party\r\nin the Assembly had gone under in the _scrutin_. Of thirteen\r\nrepresentatives only four had survived; as for me, I had received more\r\nvotes than all the others, although I was absent and silent, and\r\nalthough I had openly voted for Cavaignac in the previous month of\r\nDecember. Nevertheless, I was almost unanimously elected, less because\r\nof my opinions than of the great personal consideration which I enjoyed\r\noutside politics, an honourable position no doubt, but difficult to\r\nretain in the midst of parties, and destined to become very precarious\r\non the day when the latter should themselves become exclusive as they\r\nbecame violent.\r\n\r\nI set out as soon as I received this news. At Bonn a sudden\r\nindisposition obliged Madame de Tocqueville to stop. She herself urged\r\nme to leave her and to continue my journey, and I did so, although with\r\nregret; for I was leaving her alone in a country still agitated by civil\r\nwar; and moreover, it is in moments of difficulty or peril that her\r\ncourage and her great sense are so helpful to me.\r\n\r\nI arrived in Paris, if I am not mistaken, on the 25th of May 1849, four\r\ndays before the meeting of the Legislative, and during the last\r\nconvulsions of the Constituent Assembly. A few weeks had sufficed to\r\nmake the aspect of the political world entirely unrecognizable, owing\r\nless to the changes which had taken place in outside facts, than to the\r\nprodigious revolution which had in a few days taken place in men's\r\nminds.\r\n\r\nThe party which was in power at my departure was so still, and the\r\nmaterial result of the elections should, I thought, have strengthened\r\nits hands. This party, composed of so many different parties, and\r\nwishing either to stop or drive back the Revolution, had obtained an\r\nenormous majority in the electoral colleges, and would command more than\r\ntwo-thirds of the new Assembly. Nevertheless, I found it seized with so\r\nprofound a terror that I can only compare it with that which followed\r\nFebruary: so true is it that in politics one must argue as in war, and\r\nnever forget that the effect of events should be measured less by what\r\nthey are in themselves than by the impressions they give.\r\n\r\nThe Conservatives, who for six months had seen all the bye-elections\r\ninvariably turning to their advantage, who filled and dominated almost\r\nall the local councils, had placed an almost unlimited confidence in the\r\nsystem of universal suffrage, after professing unbounded distrust of it.\r\nIn the General Election which was just decided, they had expected not\r\nonly to conquer but to annihilate, so to speak, their adversaries, and\r\nthey were as much cast down at not attaining the absolute triumph which\r\nthey had dreamt of as though they had really been beaten. On the other\r\nhand, the Montagnards, who had thought themselves lost, were as\r\nintoxicated with joy and mad audacity as though the elections had\r\nassured them a majority in the new Assembly. Why had the event thus at\r\nthe same time deceived the hopes and fears of both parties? It is\r\ndifficult to say for certain, for great masses of men move by virtue of\r\ncauses almost as unknown to humanity itself as those which rule the\r\nmovements of the sea. In both cases the reasons of the phenomenon are\r\nconcealed and, in a sense, lost in the midst of its immensity.\r\n\r\nWe are, at any rate, entitled to believe that the Conservatives owed\r\ntheir rebuff mainly to the faults which they themselves committed. Their\r\nintolerance, when they thought their triumph assured, of those who,\r\nwithout sharing their ideas, had assisted them in fighting the\r\nMontagnards; the violent administration of the new Minister of the\r\nInterior, M. Faucher; and more than all, the poor success of the Roman\r\nexpedition prejudiced against them a portion of the people who were\r\nnaturally disposed to follow them, and threw these into the arms of the\r\nagitators.\r\n\r\nOne hundred and fifty Montagnards, as I said, had been elected. A part\r\nof the peasantry and the majority of the army had voted for them: it was\r\nthe two anchors of mercy which had snapped in the midst of the tempest.\r\nTerror was universal: it taught anew to the various monarchical parties\r\nthe tolerance and modesty which they had practised immediately after\r\nFebruary, but which they had to a great extent forgotten during the past\r\nsix months. It was recognized on every hand that there could no longer\r\nbe any question, for the present, of emerging from the Republic, and\r\nthat all that remained to be done was to oppose the moderate Republicans\r\nto the Montagnards.\r\n\r\nThe same ministers whom they had created and instigated they now\r\naccused, and a modification of the Cabinet was loudly demanded. The\r\nCabinet itself saw that it was insufficient, and implored to be\r\nreplaced. At the time of my departure I had seen the committee of the\r\nRue de Poitiers refuse to admit the name of M. Dufaure to its lists; I\r\nnow saw every glance directed towards M. Dufaure and his friends, who\r\nwere called upon in the most pathetic manner to take office and save\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nOn the night of my arrival, I heard that some of my friends were dining\r\ntogether at a little restaurant in the Champs-Elysees. I hastened to\r\njoin them, and found Dufaure, Lanjuinais, Beaumont, Corcelles, Vivien,\r\nLamoriciere, Bedeau, and one or two more whose names are not so well\r\nknown. I was informed in a few words of the position of affairs. Barrot,\r\nwho had been invited by the President to form a cabinet, had for some\r\ndays been exhausting himself in vain efforts to do so. M. Thiers, M.\r\nMole and the more important of their friends had refused to undertake\r\nthe government. They had made up their minds, nevertheless, as will be\r\nseen, to remain its masters, but without becoming ministers. The\r\nuncertainty of the future, the general instability, the difficulties and\r\nperhaps the dangers of the moment kept them aloof. They were eager\r\nenough for power, but not for responsibility. Barrot, repulsed on that\r\nside, had come to us. He asked us, or rather he besought us, to become\r\nhis colleagues. But which among us to choose? What ministries to allot\r\nto us? What colleagues to give us? What general policy to adopt? From\r\nall these questions had arisen difficulties in execution which, till\r\nthen, seemed insurmountable. Already, more than once, Barrot had\r\nreturned towards the natural chiefs of the majority; and repelled by\r\nthem, had fallen back upon us.\r\n\r\nTime passed amid these sterile labours; the dangers and difficulties\r\nincreased; the news became each day more alarming, and the Ministry were\r\nliable at any moment to be impeached by the dying but furious Assembly.\r\n\r\nI returned home greatly preoccupied, as will be believed, by what I had\r\nheard. I was convinced that it only depended upon the wishes of myself\r\nand my friends to become ministers. We were the necessary and obvious\r\nmen. I knew the leaders of the majority well enough to be sure that they\r\nwould never commit themselves to taking charge of affairs under a\r\ngovernment which seemed to them so ephemeral, and that, even if they had\r\nthe disinterestedness, they would not have the courage to do so. Their\r\npride and their timidity assured me of their abstention. It was enough\r\nfor us, therefore, to stand firm on our ground to compel them to come\r\nand fetch us. But ought we to wish to become ministers? I asked myself\r\nthis very seriously. I think I may do myself the justice to say that I\r\ndid not indulge in the smallest illusion respecting the true\r\ndifficulties of the enterprise, and that I looked upon the future with\r\na clearness of view which we rarely possess except when we consider the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nEverybody expected to see fighting in the streets. I myself regarded it\r\nas imminent; the furious audacity which the result of the elections had\r\nimparted to the Mountain and the opportunity afforded to it by the Rome\r\naffair seemed to make an event of this kind inevitable. I was not,\r\nhowever, very anxious about the issue. I was convinced that, although\r\nthe majority of the soldiers had voted for the Mountain, the army would\r\nfight against it without hesitation. The soldier who individually votes\r\nfor a candidate at an election and the soldier acting under pressure of\r\n_esprit de corps_ and military discipline are two different men. The\r\nthoughts of the one do not regulate the actions of the other. The Paris\r\ngarrison was very numerous, well commanded, experienced in street\r\nwarfare, and still filled with the memory of the passions and examples\r\nwhich had been left to it by the days of June. I therefore felt certain\r\nof victory. But I was very anxious as to the eventual results of this\r\nvictory: what seemed to others the end of the difficulties I regarded as\r\ntheir commencement. I considered them almost insurmountable, as I\r\nbelieve they really were.\r\n\r\nIn whichever direction I looked, I saw no solid or lasting stand-point\r\nfor us.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion looked to us, but it would have been unsafe to rely upon\r\nit for support; fear drove the country in our direction, but its\r\nmemories, its secret instincts, its passions could scarcely fail soon to\r\nwithdraw it from us, so soon as the fear should have vanished. Our\r\nobject was, if possible, to found the Republic, or at least to maintain\r\nit for some time, by governing it in a regular, moderate, conservative,\r\nand absolutely constitutional way; and this could not allow us to remain\r\npopular for long, since everybody wanted to evade the Constitution. The\r\nMountain wanted more, the Monarchists much less.\r\n\r\nIn the Assembly it was much worse still. The same general causes were\r\naggravated by a thousand accidents arising from the interests and\r\nvanities of the party leaders. The latter were quite content to allow us\r\nto assume the government, but we must not expect them to allow us to\r\ngovern. So soon as the crisis was passed, we might expect every sort of\r\nambush on their part.\r\n\r\nAs to the President, I did not know him yet, but it was evident that we\r\ncould not rely upon him to support us in his Council, except where the\r\njealousy and hatred were concerned with which our common adversaries\r\ninspired him. His sympathies must always lie in an opposite direction;\r\nfor our views were not only different, but naturally opposed to one\r\nanother. We wanted to make the Republic live: he longed for its\r\ninheritance. We only supplied him with ministers where he wanted\r\naccomplices.\r\n\r\nTo these difficulties, which were in a sense inherent to the situation\r\nand consequently permanent, were added passing ones which it was not at\r\nall easy to surmount: the revolutionary agitation revived in part of the\r\ncountry; the spirit and habits of exclusion spread and already rooted in\r\nthe public administration; the Roman expedition, so badly conceived and\r\nso badly conducted that it was now as difficult to bring it to an end as\r\nto get out of it; in fact, the whole legacy of mistakes committed by our\r\npredecessors.\r\n\r\nThere were reasons enough for hesitation; and yet I did not hesitate.\r\nThe idea of taking a post from which fear kept so many people off, and\r\nof relieving society from the bad pass in which it had been involved,\r\nflattered at the same time my sense of honour and my pride. I was quite\r\naware that I should only be passing through power, and that I should not\r\nstay there; but I hoped to stay long enough to be able to render some\r\nsignal service to my country and to raise myself. This was enough to\r\nattract me.\r\n\r\nI at once took three resolutions:\r\n\r\nFirst, not to refuse office if an opportunity offered;\r\n\r\nSecond, only to enter the Government together with my principal friends,\r\ndirecting the principal offices, so that we might always remain the\r\nmasters of the Cabinet;\r\n\r\nThird and last, to behave every day when in office as though I was to be\r\nout of it the next day, that is to say, without ever subordinating to\r\nthe necessity of maintaining my position that of remaining true to\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nThe next five or six days were wholly taken up in fruitless endeavours\r\nto form a ministry. The attempts made were so numerous, so overlapping,\r\nso full of small incidents--great events of one day forgotten the\r\nnext--that I find it difficult to retrace them in my memory, in spite of\r\nthe prominent part which I myself played in some of them. The problem\r\nwas undoubtedly a difficult one to solve under its given conditions. The\r\nPresident was willing enough to change the appearance of his ministry,\r\nbut he was determined to retain in it the men whom he considered his\r\nprincipal friends. The leaders of the Monarchical parties refused\r\nthemselves to take the responsibility of government; but they were not\r\nwilling either that it should be entrusted entirely to men over whom\r\nthey had no hold. If they consented to admit us, it was only in a very\r\nsmall number and in second-rate offices. We were looked upon as a\r\nnecessary but disagreeable remedy, which it was preferable only to\r\nadminister in very small doses.\r\n\r\nDufaure was first asked to join alone, and to be satisfied with the\r\nPublic Works. He refused, demanded the Interior, and two other offices\r\nfor his friends. After much difficulty they agreed to give him the\r\nInterior, but they refused the rest. I have reason to believe that he\r\nwas at one time on the point of accepting this proposal and of again\r\nleaving me in the lurch, as he had done six months ago. Not that he was\r\ntreacherous or indifferent in his friendships; but the sight of this\r\nimportant office almost within reach, which he could honestly accept,\r\npossessed a strange attraction for him. It did not precisely cause him\r\nto abandon his friends, but it distracted his thoughts from them, and\r\nmade him ready to forget them. He was firm, however, this time; and not\r\nbeing able to get him by himself, they offered to take me with him. I\r\nwas most in view at that time, because the new Legislative Assembly had\r\njust elected me one of its vice-presidents.[14] But what office to give\r\nme? I only thought myself fit to fill the Ministry of Public\r\nInstruction. Unfortunately that was in the hands of M. de Falloux, an\r\nindispensable man, whom it was equally important to the Legitimists to\r\nretain, of whom he was one of the leaders; to the religious party, who\r\nsaw in him a protector; and finally to the President, of whom he had\r\nbecome the friend. I was offered Agriculture, and refused it. At last,\r\nin despair, Barrot came and asked me to accept the Foreign Office. I\r\nmyself had made great efforts to persuade M. de Remusat to accept this\r\noffice, and what happened on this occasion between him and me is so\r\ncharacteristic that it is worthy of being retold. I was very anxious\r\nthat M. de Remusat should join the ministry with us. He was at once a\r\nfriend of M. Thiers and a man of honour, a rather unusual combination;\r\nhe alone was able to assure us, if not the support, at least the\r\nneutrality of that statesman, without infesting us with his spirit.\r\nOvercome by the insistency of Barrot and the rest of us, Remusat one\r\nevening yielded. He had pledged us his word, but the next morning he\r\ncame to withdraw it. I knew for certain that he had seen M. Thiers in\r\nthe interval, and he confessed to me himself that M. Thiers, who was\r\nthen loudly proclaiming the necessity of our accepting office, had\r\ndissuaded him from joining us. \"I fully saw,\" he said, \"that to become\r\nyour colleague would not be to give you his assistance, but only to\r\nexpose myself to be quarrelling with him before long.\" Those were the\r\nsort of men we had to deal with.\r\n\r\n     [14: 1 June 1849, by 336 votes to 261.]\r\n\r\nI had never thought of the Foreign Office, and my first impulse was to\r\nrefuse it. I thought myself unsuited to fill an office for which nothing\r\nhad prepared me. Among my papers I have found a trace of these\r\nhesitations, in the notes of a conversation which took place at a dinner\r\nwhich some of my friends and I had at that time....\r\n\r\nI decided at last, however, to accept the Foreign Office, but I made it\r\na condition that Lanjuinais should enter the Council at the same time as\r\nmyself. I had many very strong reasons for acting as I did. In the first\r\nplace, I thought that three ministers were indispensable to us in order\r\nto acquire the preponderance in the Cabinet which we needed in order to\r\ndo any good. I thought, moreover, that Lanjuinais would be very useful\r\nto keep Dufaure himself within the lines I wished to follow. I did not\r\nconsider myself to have enough hold over him. Above all, I wanted to\r\nhave near me a friend with whom I could talk openly of all things: a\r\ngreat advantage at any time, but especially in such times of suspicion\r\nand variableness as ours, and for a work as hazardous as that which I\r\nwas undertaking.\r\n\r\nFrom all these different points of view Lanjuinais suited me admirably,\r\nalthough we were of very dissimilar natures. His humour was as calm and\r\nplacid as mine was restless and anxious. He was methodical, slow,\r\nindolent, prudent, and even over-scrupulous, and he was very backward to\r\nenter upon any undertaking; but having once entered upon it he never\r\ndrew back, and showed himself until the end as resolved and stubborn as\r\na Breton of the true stamp. He was very slow in giving his opinion, and\r\nvery explicit, and even candid to the verge of rudeness, when he did\r\ngive it. One could not expect from his friendship either enthusiasm,\r\nardour, or _abandon_; on the other hand, one need not dread either\r\nfaint-heartedness, treachery, or after-thoughts. In short, he was a very\r\nsafe associate, and taken all round, the most honourable man I ever met\r\nin public life. Of all of us, it was he who seemed to me least to mix\r\nhis private or interested views with his love of the public good.\r\n\r\nNo one objected to the name of Lanjuinais; but the difficulty was to\r\nfind him a portfolio. I asked for him that of Commerce and Agriculture,\r\nwhich had been held since the 20th of December by Buffel, a friend of\r\nFalloux. The latter refused to let his colleague go; I insisted; and the\r\nnew Cabinet, which was almost complete, remained for twenty-four hours\r\nas though dissolved. To conquer my resolution, Falloux attempted a\r\ndirect measure: he came to my house, where I lay confined to my bed,\r\nurged me, begged me to give up Lanjuinais and to leave his friend Buffel\r\nat the Ministry of Agriculture. I had made up my mind, and I closed my\r\nears. Falloux was vexed, but retained his self-control and rose to go. I\r\nthought everything had gone wrong: on the contrary, everything had gone\r\nright.\r\n\r\n\"You are determined,\" he said, with that aristocratic good grace with\r\nwhich he was able to cover all his feelings, even the bitterest; \"you\r\nare determined, and so I must yield. It shall not be said that a private\r\nconsideration has, at so difficult and critical a period, made me break\r\noff so necessary a combination. I shall remain alone in the midst of\r\nyou. But I hope you will not forget that I shall be not only your\r\ncolleague but your prisoner!\"\r\n\r\nOne hour later the Cabinet was formed,[15] and Dufaure, who told me of\r\nit, invited me to take immediate possession of the Foreign Office.\r\n\r\n     [15: The Presidential decree is dated 2 June 1849.]\r\n\r\nThus was born this Ministry which was so painfully and slowly formed and\r\nwhich was destined to have so short an existence. During the long\r\nchildbirth that preceded it, the man who was at the greatest trouble in\r\nFrance was certainly Barrot: his sincere love for the public weal\r\ninclined him to desire a change of cabinet, and his ambition, which was\r\nmore intimately and narrowly bound up with his honesty than might have\r\nbeen believed, made him long with unequalled ardour to remain at the\r\nhead of the new Cabinet. He therefore went incessantly to and fro from\r\none to the other, addressing very pathetic and sometimes very eloquent\r\nobjurations to every one, now turning to the leaders of the majority,\r\nnow to us, now again to the new Republicans, whom he regarded as more\r\nmoderate than the others. And for that matter, he was equally inclined\r\nto carry either one or the other with him; for in politics he was\r\nincapable of either hatred or friendship. His heart is an evaporating\r\nvase, in which nothing remains.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n     ASPECT OF THE CABINET--ITS FIRST ACTS UNTIL AFTER THE\r\n     INSURRECTIONARY ATTEMPTS OF THE 13TH OF JUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ministry was composed as follows:\r\n\r\n     Minister of Justice and }\r\n     President of the Council}     Barrot.\r\n     Finance                       Passy.\r\n     War                           Rulhiere.\r\n     Navy                          Tracy.\r\n     Public Works                  Lacrosse.\r\n     Public Instruction            Falloux.\r\n     Interior                      Dufaure.\r\n     Agriculture                   Lanjuinais.\r\n     Foreign Affairs               Tocqueville.\r\n\r\nDufaure, Lanjuinais and I were the only new ministers; all the others\r\nhad belonged to the previous Cabinet.\r\n\r\nPassy was a man of real merit, but not of a very attractive merit. His\r\nmind was narrow, maladroit, provoking, disparaging and ingenious rather\r\nthan just. Nevertheless, he was more inclined to be just when it was\r\nreally necessary to act than when it was only a question of talking; for\r\nhe was more fond of paradox than liable to put it into practice. I never\r\nknew a greater talker, nor one who so easily consoled himself for\r\ntroublesome events by explaining the causes which had produced them and\r\nthe consequences likely to ensue. When he had finished drawing the most\r\nsombre picture of the state of affairs, he concluded with a smiling and\r\nplacid air, saying, \"So that there is practically no means of saving\r\nourselves, and we have only to look forward to the total overthrow of\r\nSociety.\" In other respects he was a cultured and experienced minister;\r\nhis courage and honesty were proof against everything; and he was as\r\nincapable of vacillation as of treachery. His ideas, his feelings, his\r\nformer intimacy with Dufaure and, above all, his eager animosity against\r\nThiers made us certain of him.\r\n\r\nRulhiere would have belonged to the monarchic and ultra-conservative\r\nparty if he had belonged to any, and especially if Changarnier had not\r\nbeen in the world; but he was a soldier who only thought of remaining\r\nMinister for War. We perceived at the first glance his extreme jealousy\r\nof the Commander-in-Chief of the Army in Paris; and the intimacy between\r\nthe latter and the leaders of the majority, and his influence over the\r\nPresident, obliged Rulhiere to throw himself into our arms, and forcibly\r\ndrove him to depend upon us.\r\n\r\nTracy had by nature a weak character, which was, as it were, enclosed\r\nand confined in the very precise and systematic theories which he owed\r\nto the ideological education he had received from his father.[16] But,\r\nin the end, contact with every-day events and the shock of revolutions\r\nhad worn out this rigid envelope, and all that remained was a wavering\r\nintelligence and a sluggish, but always honest and kindly, heart.\r\n\r\n     [16: Antoine Louis Claude Destutt de Tracy, 1754-1836, the\r\n     celebrated ideologist, Condillac's disciple.--A.T. de M.]\r\n\r\nLacrosse was a poor devil whose private affairs were more or less\r\ninvolved. The chances of the Revolution had driven him into office from\r\nan obscure corner of the Opposition, and he never grew weary of the\r\ndelight of being a minister. He gladly leant upon us, but he endeavoured\r\nat the same time to make sure of the good-will of the President of the\r\nRepublic by rendering him all sorts of little services and small\r\ncompliments. To tell the truth, it would have been difficult for him to\r\nrecommend himself in any other way, for he was a rare nonentity, and\r\nunderstood nothing about anything. We were reproached for taking office\r\nin company with such incapable ministers as Tracy and Lacrosse, and not\r\nwithout justice, for it was a great cause of ruin: not only because they\r\ndid their work badly, but because their notorious insufficiency kept\r\ntheir succession always open, so to speak, and created a sort of\r\npermanent ministerial crisis.\r\n\r\nAs to Barrot, he adhered naturally to us from feeling and ideas. His old\r\nliberal associations, his republican tastes, his Opposition memories\r\nattached him to us. Had he been differently connected, he might have\r\nbecome, however regretfully, our adversary; but, having him once among\r\nus, we were sure of him.\r\n\r\nOf all the Ministry, therefore, only Falloux was a stranger to us by his\r\nstarting-point, his engagements, and his inclinations. He alone\r\nrepresented the leaders of the majority on the Council, or rather he\r\nseemed to represent them, for in reality, as I will explain later, he\r\nrepresented, besides himself, nothing but the Church. This isolated\r\nposition, together with the secret aims of his policy, drove him to seek\r\nsupport beyond us; he strove to establish it in the Assembly and with\r\nthe President, but discreetly and cleverly, as he did everything.\r\n\r\nThus constituted, the Cabinet had one great weakness: it was about to\r\ngovern with the aid of a composite majority, without itself being a\r\ncoalition ministry. But, on the other hand, it possessed the very great\r\nstrength which ministers derive from uniform origin, identical\r\ninstincts, old bonds of friendship, mutual confidence, and common ends.\r\n\r\nI shall doubtless be asked what these ends were, where we were going,\r\nwhat we wanted. We live in times so uncertain and so obscure that I\r\nshould hesitate to reply to that question in the name of my colleagues;\r\nbut I will readily reply for myself. I did not believe then, any more\r\nthan I do now, that the republican form of government is the best suited\r\nto the needs of France. What I mean when I say the republican form of\r\ngovernment, is the elective Executive Power. With a people among whom\r\nhabit, tradition, custom have assured so great a place to the Executive\r\nPower, its instability will always be, in periods of excitement, a\r\ncause of revolution, and in peaceful times, a cause of great uneasiness.\r\nMoreover, I have always considered the Republic an ill-balanced form of\r\ngovernment, which always promised more, but gave less, liberty than the\r\nConstitutional Monarchy. And yet I sincerely wished to maintain the\r\nRepublic; and although there were, so to speak, no Republicans in\r\nFrance, I did not look upon the maintenance of it as absolutely\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nI wished to maintain it because I saw nothing ready or fit to set in its\r\nplace. The old Dynasty was profoundly antipathetic to the majority of\r\nthe country. Amid this flagging of all political passion, which was the\r\nresult of the fatigue of the revolutions and their vain promises, one\r\ngenuine passion remained alive in France: hatred of the Ancien Regime\r\nand mistrust of the old privileged classes who represented it in the\r\neyes of the people. This sentiment passes through revolutions without\r\ndissolving in them, like the water of those marvellous fountains which,\r\naccording to the ancients, passed across the waves of the sea without\r\nmixing with or disappearing in them. As to the Orleans Dynasty, the\r\nexperience the people had had of it did not particularly incline them to\r\nreturn to it so soon. It was bound once more to throw into Opposition\r\nall the upper classes and the clergy, and to separate itself from the\r\npeople, as it had done before, leaving the cares and profits of\r\ngovernment to those same middle classes whom I had already seen during\r\neighteen years so inadequate for the good government of France.\r\nMoreover, nothing was ready for its triumph.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon alone was ready to take the place of the Republic,\r\nbecause he already held the power in his hands. But what could come of\r\nhis success, except a bastard Monarchy, despised by the enlightened\r\nclasses, hostile to liberty, governed by intriguers, adventurers, and\r\nvalets?\r\n\r\nThe Republic was doubtless difficult to maintain; for those who favoured\r\nit were, for the most part, incapable or unworthy of governing it, while\r\nthose who were fit to conduct it detested it. But it was also rather\r\ndifficult to pull down. The hatred borne for it was an easy-going\r\nhatred, as were all the passions which the country then entertained.\r\nBesides, the Government was found fault with, but no other was loved in\r\nits place. Three parties, mutually irreconcilable, more hostile to one\r\nanother than either of them was to the Republic, contended with each\r\nother for the future. As to a majority, there was no such thing.\r\n\r\nI thought, therefore, that the Government of the Republic, having\r\nexistence in its favour, and having no adversaries except minorities\r\ndifficult to coalesce, would be able to maintain its position amid the\r\ninertia of the masses, if it was conducted with moderation and wisdom.\r\nFor this reason, I was resolved not to lend myself to any steps that\r\nmight be taken against it, but rather to defend it. Almost all the\r\nmembers of the Council thought as I did. Dufaure believed more than I\r\ndid in the soundness of republican institutions and in their future.\r\nBarrot was less inclined than I to keep them always respected; but we\r\nall wished at the present time firmly to maintain them. This common\r\nresolution was our political bond and standard.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the Ministry was formed, it repaired to the President of the\r\nRepublic to hold a Council. It was the first time I had come into\r\ncontact with him. I had only seen him at a distance at the time of the\r\nConstituent Assembly. He received us with politeness. It was all we\r\ncould expect from him, for Dufaure had acted vigorously against him, and\r\nhad spoken almost outrageously of his candidature no longer than six\r\nmonths ago, while both Lanjuinais and myself had openly voted for his\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon plays so great a part in the rest of my narrative that he\r\nseems to me to deserve a special portrait amid the host of\r\ncontemporaries of whom I have been content to sketch the features. Of\r\nall his ministers, and perhaps of all the men who refused to take part\r\nin his conspiracy against the Republic, I was the one who was most\r\nadvanced in his good graces, who saw him closest, and who was best able\r\nto judge him.\r\n\r\nHe was vastly superior to what his preceding career and his mad\r\nenterprises might very properly have led one to believe of him. This was\r\nmy first impression on conversing with him. In this respect he deceived\r\nhis adversaries, and perhaps still more his friends, if this term can be\r\napplied to the politicians who patronized his candidature. The greater\r\npart of these, in fact, elected him, not because of his merits, but\r\nbecause of his presumed mediocrity. They expected to find in him an\r\ninstrument which they could handle as they pleased, and which it would\r\nalways be lawful for them to break when they wished to. In this they\r\nwere greatly deceived.\r\n\r\nAs a private individual, Louis Napoleon possessed certain attractive\r\nqualities: an easy and kindly humour, a mind which was gentle, and even\r\ntender, without being delicate, great confidence in his intercourse,\r\nperfect simplicity, a certain personal modesty amidst the immense pride\r\nderived from his origin. He was capable of showing affection, and able\r\nto inspire it in those who approached him. His conversation was brief\r\nand unsuggestive. He had not the art of drawing others out or of\r\nestablishing intimate relations with them; nor any facility in\r\nexpressing his views. He had the writer's habit, and a certain amount of\r\nthe author's self-love. His dissimulation, which was the deep\r\ndissimulation of a man who has spent his life in plots, was assisted in\r\na remarkable way by the immobility of his features and his want of\r\nexpression: for his eyes were dull and opaque, like the thick glass used\r\nto light the cabins of ships, which admits the light but cannot be seen\r\nthrough. Careless of danger, he possessed a fine, cool courage in days\r\nof crisis; and at the same time--a common thing enough--he was very\r\nvacillating in his plans. He was often seen to change his direction, to\r\nadvance, hesitate, draw back, to his great detriment: for the nation had\r\nchosen him in order to dare all things, and what it expected from him\r\nwas audacity and not prudence. It was said that he had always been\r\ngreatly addicted to pleasures, and not very dainty in his choice of\r\nthem. This passion for vulgar enjoyment and this taste for luxury had\r\nincreased still more with the facilities offered by his position. Each\r\nday he wore out his energy in indulgence, and deadened and degraded even\r\nhis ambition. His intelligence was incoherent, confused, filled with\r\ngreat but ill-assorted thoughts, which he borrowed now from the examples\r\nof Napoleon, now from socialistic theories, sometimes from recollections\r\nof England, where he had lived: very different, and often very contrary,\r\nsources. These he had laboriously collected in his solitary meditations,\r\nfar removed from the contact of men and facts, for he was naturally a\r\ndreamer and a visionary. But when he was forced to emerge from these\r\nvague, vast regions in order to confine his mind to the limits of a\r\npiece of business, it showed itself to be capable of justice, sometimes\r\nof subtlety and compass, and even of a certain depth, but never sure,\r\nand always prepared to place a grotesque idea by the side of a correct\r\none.\r\n\r\nGenerally, it was difficult to come into long and very close contact\r\nwith him without discovering a little vein of madness running through\r\nhis better sense, the sight of which always recalled the escapades of\r\nhis youth, and served to explain them.\r\n\r\nIt may be admitted, for that matter, that it was his madness rather than\r\nhis reason which, thanks to circumstances, caused his success and his\r\nforce: for the world is a strange theatre. There are moments in it when\r\nthe worst plays are those which succeed best. If Louis Napoleon had been\r\na wise man, or a man of genius, he would never have become President of\r\nthe Republic.\r\n\r\nHe trusted in his star; he firmly believed himself to be the instrument\r\nof destiny and the necessary man. I have always believed that he was\r\nreally convinced of his right, and I doubt whether Charles X. was ever\r\nmore infatuated with his legitimism than he with his. Moreover, he was\r\nquite as incapable of alleging a reason for his faith; for, although he\r\nhad a sort of abstract adoration for the people, he had very little\r\ntaste for liberty. The characteristic and fundamental feature of his\r\nmind in political matters was his hatred of and contempt for assemblies.\r\nThe rule of the Constitutional Monarchy seemed to him even more\r\ninsupportable than that of the Republic. His unlimited pride in the name\r\nhe bore, which willingly bowed before the nation, revolted at the idea\r\nof yielding to the influence of a parliament.\r\n\r\nBefore attaining power he had had time to strengthen his natural taste\r\nfor the footman class, which is always displayed by mediocre princes, by\r\nthe habits of twenty years of conspiracy spent amid low-class\r\nadventurers, men of ruined fortunes or blemished reputations, and young\r\ndebauchees, the only persons who, during all this time, could have\r\nconsented to serve him as go-betweens or accomplices. He himself, in\r\nspite of his good manners, allowed a glimpse to pierce through of the\r\nadventurer and the prince of fortune. He continued to take pleasure in\r\nthis inferior company after he was no longer obliged to live in it. I\r\nbelieve that his difficulty in expressing his thoughts otherwise than in\r\nwriting attached him to people who had long been familiar with his\r\ncurrent of thought and with his dreamings, and that his inferiority in\r\nconversation rendered him generally averse to contact with clever men.\r\nMoreover, he desired above all things to meet with devotion to his\r\nperson and his cause, as though his person and his cause were such as to\r\nbe able to arouse devotion: merit annoyed him when it displayed ever so\r\nlittle independence. He wanted believers in his star, and vulgar\r\nworshippers of his fortune.\r\n\r\nThis was the man whom the need of a chief and the power of a memory had\r\nplaced at the head of France, and with whom we would have to govern.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine a more critical moment in which to\r\nassume the direction of affairs. The Constituent Assembly, before ending\r\nits turbulent existence, had passed a resolution, on the 7th of June\r\n1849, prohibiting the Government from attacking Rome. The first thing I\r\nlearnt on entering the Cabinet was that the order to attack Rome had\r\nbeen sent to the army three days before. This flagrant disobedience of\r\nthe injunctions of a sovereign Assembly, this war undertaken against a\r\npeople in revolution, because of its revolution, and in defiance of the\r\nterms of the Constitution which commanded us to respect all foreign\r\nnationalities, made inevitable and brought nearer the conflict which we\r\ndreaded. What would be the issue of this new struggle? All the letters\r\nfrom prefects of departments that were laid before us, all the police\r\nreports that reached us were calculated to throw us into great alarm. I\r\nhad seen, at the end of the Cavaignac Administration, how a government\r\ncan be supported in its visionary hopes by the self-interested\r\ncomplaisance of its agents. This time I saw, and much more closely, how\r\nthese same agents can work to increase the terror of those who employ\r\nthem: contrary effects produced by the same cause. Each one of them,\r\njudging that we were uneasy, wished to signalize himself by the\r\ndiscovery of new plots, and in his turn to supply us with some fresh\r\nindication of the conspiracy which threatened us. The more they believed\r\nin our success, the more readily they talked to us of our danger. For it\r\nis one of the dangerous characteristics of this sort of information,\r\nthat it becomes rarer and less explicit in the measure that the peril\r\nincreases and the need for information becomes greater. The agents in\r\nthat case, doubting the duration of the government which employs them,\r\nand already fearing its successor, either scarcely speak at all or keep\r\nabsolute silence. But now they made a great noise. To listen to them, it\r\nwas impossible not to think that we were on the edge of an abyss, and\r\nyet I did not believe a word of it. I was quite convinced then, as I\r\nhave been ever since, that official correspondence and police reports,\r\nwhich may be useful for purposes of consultation when there is question\r\nof discovering a particular plot, only serve to give exaggerated and\r\nincomplete and invariably false notions when one wishes to judge or\r\nforesee great movements of parties. In a matter of this kind, it is the\r\naspect of the whole country, the knowledge of its needs, its passions\r\nand its ideas, that can instruct us, general _data_ which one can\r\nprocure for one's self, and which are never supplied by even the best\r\nplaced and best accredited agents.\r\n\r\nThe sight of these general facts had led me to believe that at this\r\nmoment no armed revolution was to be feared: but a combat was; and the\r\nexpectation of civil war is always cruel, especially when it comes in\r\ntime to join its fury to that of pestilence. Paris was at that time\r\nravaged by cholera. Death struck at all ranks. Already a large number of\r\nmembers of the Constituent Assembly had succumbed; and Bugeaud, whom\r\nAfrica had spared, was dying.\r\n\r\nHad I entertained a moment's doubt as to the imminence of the crisis,\r\nthe aspect alone of the new Assembly would have clearly announced it to\r\nme. It is not too much to say that one breathed the atmosphere of civil\r\nwar in its midst. The speeches were short, the gestures violent, the\r\nwords extravagant, the insults outrageous and direct. We met for the\r\npresent in the old Chamber of Deputies. This room, built for 460\r\nmembers, had difficulty in containing 750. The members, therefore, sat\r\ntouching, while detesting, each other; they pressed one against the\r\nother in spite of the hatred which divided them; the discomfort\r\nincreased their anger. It was a duel in a barrel. How would the\r\nMontagnards be able to restrain themselves? They saw that they were\r\nsufficiently numerous to entitle them to believe themselves very strong\r\nin the country and in the army. Yet they remained too weak in Parliament\r\nto hope to prevail or even to count there. They were offered a fine\r\noccasion of resorting to force. All Europe, which was still in\r\ncommotion, might with one great blow, struck in Paris, be thrown into\r\nrevolution anew. This was more than was necessary for men of such savage\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to foresee that the movement would burst forth at the moment\r\nwhen it should become known that the order had been given to attack Rome\r\nand that the attack had taken place. And this was what in fact occurred.\r\n\r\nThe order given had remained secret. But on the 10th of June, the\r\nreport of the first combat became current.\r\n\r\nOn the 11th, the Mountain burst into furious speech. Ledru-Rollin made\r\nan appeal from the tribune for civil war, saying that the Constitution\r\nhad been violated and that he and his friends were ready to defend it by\r\nevery method, including that of arms. The indictment was demanded of the\r\nPresident of the Republic and of the preceding Cabinet.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th, the Committee of the Assembly, instructed to examine the\r\nquestion raised the day before, rejected the impeachment and called upon\r\nthe Assembly to pronounce, where it sat, upon the fate of the President\r\nand Ministers. The Mountain opposed this immediate discussion and\r\ndemanded that documents should be laid before it. What was its object in\r\nthus postponing the debate? It was difficult to say. Did it hope that\r\nthis delay would complete the general irritation, or did it in its heart\r\nof hearts wish to give it time to calm down? One thing is certain, that\r\nits principal leaders, those who were more accustomed to speaking than\r\nto fighting, and who were passionate rather than resolute, displayed\r\nthat day, amid all the intemperance of their language, a sort of\r\nhesitation of which they had given no sign the day before. After half\r\ndrawing the sword from the scabbard, they appeared to wish to replace\r\nit; but it was too late, the signal had been observed by their friends\r\noutside, and thenceforward they no longer led, but were led in their\r\nturn.\r\n\r\nDuring these two days, my position was most cruel. As I have already\r\nstated, I disapproved entirely of the manner in which the Roman\r\nexpedition had been undertaken and conducted. Before joining the\r\nCabinet, I had solemnly declared to Barrot that I declined to take any\r\nresponsibility except for the future, and that he must himself be\r\nprepared to defend what had up to that time been done in Italy. I had\r\nonly accepted office on this condition. I therefore kept silent during\r\nthe discussion on the 11th, and allowed Barrot to bear the brunt of the\r\nbattle alone. But when, on the 12th, I saw my colleagues threatened with\r\nan impeachment, I considered that I could no longer abstain. The demand\r\nfor fresh documents gave me an opportunity to intervene, without having\r\nto express an opinion upon the original question. I did so vigorously,\r\nalthough in very few words.\r\n\r\nOn reading over this little speech in the _Moniteur_, I cannot but think\r\nit very insignificant and badly turned. Nevertheless, I was applauded to\r\nthe echo by the majority, because in moments of crisis, when one is in\r\ndanger of civil war, it is the movement of thought and the accent of\r\none's words which make an impression, rather than their value. I\r\ndirectly attacked Ledru-Rollin. I accused him with violence of only\r\nwanting troubles and of spreading lies in order to create them. The\r\nfeeling which impelled me to speak was an energetic one, the tone was\r\ndetermined and aggressive, and although I spoke very badly, being as\r\nyet unaccustomed to my new part, I met with much favour.\r\n\r\nLedru replied to me, and told the majority that they were on the side of\r\nthe Cossacks. They answered that he was on the side of the plunderers\r\nand the incendiaries. Thiers, commenting on this thought, said that\r\nthere was an intimate relation between the man they had just listened to\r\nand the insurgents of June. The Assembly rejected the demand for an\r\nimpeachment by a large majority, and broke up.\r\n\r\nAlthough the leaders of the Mountain continued to be outrageous, they\r\nhad not shown any great firmness, so that we were able to flatter\r\nourselves that the decisive moment for the struggle had not yet arrived.\r\nBut this was a mistake. The reports which we received during the night\r\ntold us that the people were preparing to take up arms.\r\n\r\nOn the next day, in fact, the language of the demagogic papers\r\nproclaimed that the editors no longer relied upon justice, but upon a\r\nrevolution, to acquit them. All of them called either directly or\r\nindirectly for civil war. The National Guard, the schools, the entire\r\npopulation was summoned by them to repair, unarmed, to a certain\r\nlocality, in order to go and present themselves in mass before the doors\r\nof the Assembly. It was a 23rd of June which they wished to commence\r\nwith a 15th of May; and, in fact, seven or eight thousand people did\r\nmeet at about eleven o'clock at the Chateau-d'Eau. We on our side held\r\na Council under the President of the Republic. The latter was already in\r\nuniform, and prepared to go out on horseback so soon as he should be\r\ntold that the fighting had commenced. For the rest, he had changed\r\nnothing except his clothes. He was exactly the same man as on the day\r\nbefore: the same rather dejected air, his speech no less slow and no\r\nless embarrassed, his eye no less dull. He showed none of that sort of\r\nwarlike excitement and of rather feverish gaiety which the approach of\r\ndanger so often gives: an attitude which is perhaps, after all, no more\r\nthan the sign of a mind disturbed.\r\n\r\nWe sent for Changarnier, who explained his preparations to us, and\r\nguaranteed a victory. Dufaure communicated to us the reports he had\r\nreceived, all of which told of a formidable insurrection. He then left\r\nfor the Ministry of the Interior, which was the centre of action, and at\r\nabout mid-day I repaired to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe House was some time before it met, because the President, without\r\nconsulting us, had declared, when arranging the Order of the Day on the\r\nevening before, that there would be no public sitting on the next day, a\r\nstrange blunder which would have looked like treachery in anyone else.\r\nWhile messengers were being despatched to inform the members at their\r\nown houses, I went to see the President of the Assembly in his private\r\nroom: most of the leaders of the majority were there before me. Every\r\nface bore traces of excitement and anxiety; the contest was both feared\r\nand demanded. They began by vehemently accusing the Ministry of\r\nslackness. Thiers, lying back in a big arm-chair, with his legs crossed\r\none over the other, sat rubbing his stomach (for he felt certain\r\nsymptoms of the prevailing epidemic), loudly and angrily exclaiming, in\r\nhis shrillest _falsetto_, that it was very strange that no one seemed to\r\nthink of declaring Paris in a state of siege. I replied gently that we\r\nhad thought of it, but that the moment had not yet come to do so, since\r\nthe Assembly had not yet met.\r\n\r\nThe members arrived from every side, attracted less by the messages\r\ndespatched to them, which most of them had not even received, than by\r\nthe rumours prevalent in the town. The sitting was opened at two\r\no'clock. The benches of the majority were well filled, but the top of\r\nthe Mountain was deserted. The gloomy silence which reigned in this part\r\nof the House was more alarming than the shouts which came from that\r\nquarter as a rule. It was a proof that discussion had ceased, and that\r\nthe civil war was about to commence.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock, Dufaure came and asked that the state of siege should\r\nbe proclaimed in Paris. Cavaignac seconded him in one of those short\r\naddresses which he sometimes delivered, and in which his mind, which was\r\nnaturally middling and confused reached the level of his soul and\r\napproached the sublime. Under these circumstances he became, for a\r\nmoment, the man of the most genuine eloquence that I have ever heard\r\nspeak in our Assemblies: he left all the mere orators far behind him.\r\n\r\n\"You have just said,\" he exclaimed, addressing the Montagnard[17] who\r\nwas leaving the tribune, \"that I have fallen from power. That is not\r\ntrue: I retired voluntarily. The national will does not overthrow; it\r\ncommands, and we obey. I add--and I want the republican party always to\r\nbe able to say so with justice: I retired voluntarily, and, in so doing,\r\nmy conduct did honour to my republican convictions. You said that we\r\nlived in terror: history is observing us, and will pronounce when the\r\ntime comes. But what I say to you myself is this, that although you have\r\nnot succeeded in inspiring me with a feeling of terror, you have\r\ninspired me with a feeling of profound sorrow. Shall I tell you one\r\nthing more? You are Republicans of long standing; whereas I have not\r\nworked for the Republic before its foundation, I have not suffered for\r\nit, and I regret that this is so; but I have served it faithfully, and I\r\nhave done more: I have governed it. I shall serve nothing else,\r\nunderstand me well! Write it down, take it down in shorthand, so that it\r\nmay remain engraved upon the annals of our deliberations: _I shall serve\r\nnothing else_! Between you and me, I take it, it is a question as to\r\nwhich of us will serve the Republic best. Well then, my regret is, that\r\nyou have served it very badly. I hope, for the sake of my country, that\r\nit is not destined to fall; but if we should be condemned to undergo so\r\ngreat a blow, remember--remember distinctly--that we shall accuse your\r\nexaggerations and your fury as being the cause of it.\"\r\n\r\n     [17: Pierre Leroux.]\r\n\r\nShortly after the state of siege had been proclaimed, we learnt that the\r\ninsurrection had been extinguished. Changarnier and the President,\r\ncharging at the head of the cavalry, had cut in two and dispersed the\r\ncolumn which was making its way towards the Assembly. A few\r\nnewly-erected barricades had been destroyed, without striking a blow.\r\nThe Montagnards, surrounded in the Conservatoire of Arts and Crafts,\r\nwhich they had turned into their head-quarters, had either been arrested\r\nor taken to flight. We were the masters of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe same movement took place in several of the large towns, with more\r\nvigour but no less success. At Lyons, the fighting lasted stubbornly for\r\nfive hours, and the victory was for a moment in doubt. But for that\r\nmatter, when we were once victorious in Paris, we distressed ourselves\r\nvery little about the provinces; for we knew that in France, in matters\r\nboth of order and of disorder, Paris lays down the law.\r\n\r\nThus ended the second Insurrection of June, very different to the first\r\nby the extent of its violence and its duration, but similar in the\r\ncauses which led to its failure. At the time of the first, the people,\r\ncarried away less by their opinions than by their appetites, had fought\r\nalone, without being able to attract their representatives to their\r\nhead. This time the representatives had been unable to induce the people\r\nto follow them into battle. In June 1848, the army had no leaders; in\r\nJune 1849, the leaders had no army.\r\n\r\nThey were singular personages, those Montagnards: their quarrelsome\r\nnature and their self-conceit were displayed even in measures which\r\nleast allowed of it. Among those who, in their newspapers and in their\r\nown persons, had spoken most violently in favour of civil war, and who\r\nhad done the most to cover us with insults, was Considerant, the pupil\r\nand successor of Fourier, and the author of so many socialistic dreams\r\nwhich would only have been ridiculous at any other time, but which were\r\ndangerous in ours. Considerant succeeded in escaping with Ledru-Rollin\r\nfrom the Conservatoire, and in reaching the Belgian frontier. I had\r\nformerly had social relations with him, and when he arrived in Brussels,\r\nhe wrote to me:\r\n\r\n     \"My dear Tocqueville,\r\n\r\n     (Here followed a request for a service which he asked me to do for\r\n     him, and then he went on):\r\n\r\n     \"Rely upon me at all times for any personal service. You are good\r\n     for two or three months perhaps, and the pure Whites who will\r\n     follow you are good for six months at the longest. You will both\r\n     of you, it is true, have well deserved what is infallibly bound to\r\n     happen to you a little sooner or a little later. But let us talk no\r\n     more politics and respect the very legal, very loyal, and very\r\n     Odilon Barrotesque state of siege.\"\r\n\r\nTo this I replied:\r\n\r\n     \"My dear Considerant,\r\n\r\n     \"I have done what you ask. I do not wish to take advantage of so\r\n     small a service, but I am very pleased to ascertain, by the way,\r\n     that those odious oppressors of liberty, the Ministers, inspire\r\n     their adversaries with so much confidence that the latter, after\r\n     outlawing them, do not hesitate to apply to them to obtain what is\r\n     just. This proves that there is some good left in us, whatever may\r\n     be said of us. Are you quite sure that if the position had been\r\n     inverted, I should have been able to act in the same way, I will\r\n     not say towards yourself, but towards such and such of your\r\n     political friends whom I might mention? I think the contrary, and I\r\n     solemnly declare to you that if ever they become the masters, I\r\n     shall consider myself quite satisfied if they only leave my head\r\n     upon my shoulders, and ready to declare that their virtue has\r\n     surpassed my greatest expectations.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n     OUR DOMESTIC POLICY--INTERNAL QUARRELS IN THE CABINET--ITS\r\n     DIFFICULTIES IN ITS RELATIONS WITH THE MAJORITY AND THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were victorious, but our real difficulties were only about to\r\ncommence, and I expected them. I have always held as a maxim, moreover,\r\nthat it is after a great success that one generally comes across the\r\nmost dangerous chances of ruin: so long as the peril lasts, one has only\r\nhis adversaries to deal with, and he triumphs; but after the victory,\r\none begins to have to reckon with himself, his slackness, his pride, the\r\nimprudent security inspired by victory, and he succumbs.\r\n\r\nI was not exposed to this last danger, for I never imagined that we had\r\nsurmounted our principal obstacles. I knew that these lay with the very\r\nmen with whom we would have to govern the country, and that the rapid\r\nand signal defeat of the Montagnards, instead of guaranteeing us against\r\nthe ill-will of the former, would expose us to it without delay. We\r\nshould have been much stronger if we had not succeeded so well.\r\n\r\nThe majority consisted in the main, at that time, of three parties (the\r\nPresident's party in Parliament was as yet too few in number and of too\r\nevil repute to count). Sixty to eighty members at the utmost were\r\nsincerely with us in our endeavours to found a Moderate Republic, and\r\nthese formed the only body we could rely upon in that huge Assembly. The\r\nremainder of the majority consisted of Legitimists, to the number of\r\nsome one hundred and sixty, and of old friends or supporters of the\r\nMonarchy of July, for the most part representing those middle classes\r\nwho had governed, and above all exploited, France during eighteen years.\r\nI felt at once that of these two parties, that of which we could most\r\neasily make use in our plans was the Legitimist party. The Legitimists\r\nhad been excluded from power under the last government; they therefore\r\nhad no places and no salaries to regret. Moreover, being for the most\r\npart considerable land-owners, they had not the same need of public\r\nfunctions as the middle class; or, at least, custom had not taught them\r\nthe sweetness of place. Although in principles more irreconcilable to\r\nthe Republic than the others, they were better able than most to accept\r\nits duration, for it had destroyed their destroyer, and had opened up to\r\nthem a prospect of power; it had served at once their ambition and their\r\ndesire for revenge; and it only aroused against itself their fear, which\r\nwas, in truth, very great. The old Conservatives, who formed the bulk of\r\nthe majority, were much more eager to do away with the Republic; but as\r\nthe furious hatred which they bore it was strongly held in check by the\r\nfear of the risk they would run in endeavouring prematurely to abolish\r\nit, and as, moreover, they had long been accustomed to follow in the\r\nwake of power, it would have been easy for us to lead them had we been\r\nable to obtain the support, or even the mere neutrality of their\r\nleaders, of whom the principal were then, as is known, M. Thiers and M.\r\nMole.\r\n\r\nAppreciating this position of affairs, I understood that it was\r\nnecessary to subordinate all secondary objects to the principal end in\r\nview, which was to prevent the overthrow of the Republic and especially\r\nto hinder the establishment of the bastard monarchy of Louis Napoleon.\r\nThis was at the time the nearest threatening danger.\r\n\r\nI thought first of guaranteeing myself against the mistakes of my\r\nfriends, for I have always considered as profoundly sensible the old\r\nNorman proverb which says, \"Lord, preserve me from my friends: I will\r\npreserve myself from mine enemies.\"\r\n\r\nAt the head of our adherents in the National Assembly was General\r\nLamoriciere, and I greatly dreaded his petulancy, his imprudent\r\nobservations, and especially his idleness. I endeavoured to appoint him\r\nto an important and distant embassy. Russia had spontaneously recognized\r\nthe new Republic; it was proper that we should resume the diplomatic\r\nrelations with her which had been almost interrupted under the last\r\nGovernment. I cast my eyes upon Lamoriciere in order to entrust him with\r\nthis extraordinary and distant mission. He was, besides, a man cut out\r\nfor a post of this kind, in which few but generals, and celebrated\r\ngenerals, succeed. I had some difficulty in persuading him, but the most\r\ndifficult thing was to persuade the President of the Republic. He at\r\nfirst resisted, and told me on that occasion, with a sort of simplicity\r\nwhich pointed less to candour than to his difficulty in finding words in\r\nwhich to express himself (these very rarely gave utterance to his\r\nthoughts, but sometimes permitted them to glimmer through), that he\r\nwished to be represented at the principal Courts by ambassadors devoted\r\nto himself. This was not my view of the matter; for I, who was called\r\nupon to instruct the ambassadors, was quite determined to devote myself\r\nonly to France. I therefore insisted, but I should have failed if I had\r\nnot summoned M. de Falloux to my aid. Falloux was the only man in the\r\nMinistry in whom the President at that time had confidence. He persuaded\r\nhim with arguments, of which I do not know the purport, and Lamoriciere\r\nleft for Russia. I shall say later what he did.\r\n\r\nHis departure reassured me as to the conduct of our friends, and I\r\nthought of winning or retaining the necessary allies. Here the task was\r\nmore difficult on all points; for, outside my own department, I was\r\nunable to do anything without the consent of the Cabinet, which\r\ncontained a number of the most honest minds that one could meet, but so\r\ninflexible and narrow in matters of politics, that I have sometimes\r\ngone so far as to regret not having rather had to do with intelligent\r\nrascals.\r\n\r\nAs to the Legitimists, my opinion was that they should be allowed to\r\nretain great influence in the direction of Public Instruction. This\r\nproposal had its drawbacks, but it was the only one which could satisfy\r\nthem, and which could ensure us their support in return, when it should\r\nbecome a question of restraining the President and preventing him from\r\nupsetting the Constitution. This plan was followed. Falloux was given a\r\nfree hand in his own department, and the Council allowed him to bring\r\nbefore the Assembly the plan of Public Instruction, which since became\r\nlaw on the 15th of March 1850. I also advised my colleagues to all the\r\nextent of my power to keep up good relations individually with the\r\nprincipal members of the Legitimist party, and I followed this line of\r\nconduct myself. I soon became and remained, of all the members of the\r\nCabinet, the one who lived in the best understanding with them. I even\r\nended by becoming the sole intermediary between them and ourselves.\r\n\r\nIt is true that my birth and the society in which I had been brought up\r\ngave me great facilities for this which the others did not possess; for,\r\nalthough the French nobility have ceased to be a class, they have yet\r\nremained a sort of freemasonry, of which all the members continue to\r\nrecognize one another through certain invisible signs, whatever may be\r\nthe opinions which make them strangers to one another, or even\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\nIt so happened, therefore, that after annoying Falloux more than anyone\r\nelse had done before entering the Cabinet, I had no sooner joined it\r\nthan I easily became his friend. For that matter, he was a man worth\r\ntaking the trouble of coaxing. I do not think that during my whole\r\npolitical career I ever met anyone of a rarer nature. He possessed the\r\ntwo essentials necessary for good leadership: an ardent conviction,\r\nwhich constantly drove him towards his aim without allowing itself to be\r\nturned aside by mortifications or dangers, and a mind which was both\r\nfirm and supple, and which applied a great multiplicity and prodigious\r\nvariety of means to the execution of a single plan. He was sincere in\r\nthis sense, that he only considered, as he declared, his cause and not\r\nhis private interest; but otherwise very sly, with a very uncommon and\r\nvery effective slyness, for he succeeded, for the time being, in\r\nmingling truth and falsehood in his own belief, before serving up the\r\nmixture to the minds of others. This is the great secret which gives\r\nfalsehood all the advantages of sincerity, and which permits its\r\nexponent to persuade to the error which he considers beneficial those\r\nwhom he works upon or directs.\r\n\r\nIn spite of all my efforts, I was never able to bring about, I will not\r\nsay a good understanding, but even a polite understanding between\r\nFalloux and Dufaure. It must be admitted that these two men had\r\nprecisely the opposite qualities and defects. Dufaure, who in the bottom\r\nof his heart had remained a good west-country bourgeois, hostile to the\r\nnobles and the priests, was unable to put up with either Falloux's\r\nprinciples or his charming, refined manners, however agreeable they\r\nmight seem to me. I succeeded, however, with great difficulty, in\r\npersuading him that he must not interfere with him in his own\r\ndepartment; but as to allowing him to exercise the smallest influence\r\nupon what went on at the Ministry of the Interior (even within the\r\nlimits where this was permissible and necessary), he would never hear\r\nspeak of it. Falloux had in Anjou, where he came from, a prefect with\r\nwhom he had reason to find fault. He did not ask that he should be\r\ndismissed, or even refused promotion; all he wanted was that he should\r\nbe transferred, as he thought his own position compromised so long as no\r\nchange took place, a change which was, moreover, demanded by the\r\nmajority of the deputies for Maine-et-Loire. Unfortunately, this prefect\r\nwas a declared friend to the Republic; and this was enough to fill\r\nDufaure with distrust, and to persuade him that Falloux's only object\r\nwas to compromise him by making use of him to strike at those of the\r\nRepublicans whom he had not been able to reach till then. He refused,\r\ntherefore; the other insisted; Dufaure grew still more obstinate. It was\r\nvery amusing to watch Falloux spinning round Dufaure, pirouetting\r\ncleverly and gracefully, without finding a single opening by which to\r\npenetrate into his mind.\r\n\r\nDufaure let him have his say, and then confined himself to laconically\r\nreplying, without looking at him, or only turning a dull, wry glance in\r\nhis direction:\r\n\r\n\"I should like to know why you did not take advantage of your friend M.\r\nFaucher's period at the Home Office to rid yourself of your prefect.\"\r\n\r\nFalloux contained himself, although he was naturally, I believe, of a\r\nvery hasty temper; he came and told me his troubles, and I saw the\r\nbitterest spleen trickling through the honey of his speech. I thereupon\r\nintervened, and tried to make Dufaure understand that this was one of\r\nthose demands which one cannot refuse a colleague unless one wishes to\r\nquarrel with him. I spent a month in this way, acting as a daily\r\nintermediary between the two, and expending more effort and diplomacy\r\nthan I had employed, during the same period, in treating the great\r\naffairs of Europe. The Cabinet was more than once on the verge of\r\nbreaking up over this puny incident. Dufaure gave way at last, but with\r\nsuch bad grace that it was impossible to thank him for it; so that he\r\ngave up his prefect without getting Falloux in exchange.\r\n\r\nBut the most difficult portion of our role was the conduct which we had\r\nto display towards the old Conservatives, who formed the bulk of the\r\nmajority, as I have already said.\r\n\r\nThese had at one and the same time general opinions which they wished to\r\nforce through and a number of private passions which they desired to\r\nsatisfy. They wanted us to re-establish order energetically: in this we\r\nwere their men; we wanted it as much as they did, and we did it as well\r\nas they could wish, and better than they could have done. We had\r\nproclaimed the state of siege in Lyons and several of the neighbouring\r\ndepartments, and by virtue of the state of siege we had suspended six\r\nParis revolutionary papers, cashiered the three regiments of the Paris\r\nNational Guard which had displayed indecision on the 13th of June,\r\narrested seven representatives on the spot, and applied for warrants\r\nagainst thirty others. Analogous measures were taken all over France.\r\nCirculars addressed to all the agents showed them that they had to do\r\nwith a Government which knew how to make itself obeyed, and which was\r\ndetermined that everything should give way before the law. Whenever\r\nDufaure was attacked on account of these different acts by the\r\nMontagnards remaining in the Assembly, he replied with that masculine,\r\nnervous, and sharp-edged eloquence of which he was so great a master,\r\nand in the tone of a man who fights after burning his boats.\r\n\r\nThe Conservatives not only wanted us to administrate with vigour; they\r\nwished us to take advantage of our victory to pass preventive and\r\nrepressive laws. We ourselves felt the necessity of moving in this\r\ndirection, although we were not willing to go as far as they.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I was convinced that it was both wise and necessary to make\r\ngreat concessions in this respect to the fears and the legitimate\r\nresentment of the nation, and that the only means which remained, after\r\nso violent a revolution, of saving liberty was to restrict it. My\r\ncolleagues were of the same opinion: we therefore brought in\r\nsuccessively a law to suspend the clubs; another to suppress, with even\r\nmore energy than had been done under the Monarchy, the vagaries of the\r\npress; and a third to regulate the state of siege.\r\n\r\n\"You are establishing a military dictatorship,\" they cried.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Dufaure, \"it is a dictatorship, but a parliamentary\r\ndictatorship. There are no individual rights which can prevail against\r\nthe inalienable right of Society to protect itself. There are imperious\r\nnecessities which are the same for all governments, whether monarchies\r\nor republics; and who has given rise to these necessities? To whom do we\r\nowe the cruel experience which has given us eighteen months of violent\r\nagitations, incessant conspiracies, formidable insurrections? Yes, no\r\ndoubt you are quite right when you say that, after so many revolutions\r\nundertaken in the name of liberty, it is deplorable that we should be\r\nonce again compelled to veil her statue and to place terrible weapons in\r\nthe hands of the public powers. But whose fault is it, if not yours,\r\nand who is it that serves the Republic best, those who favour\r\ninsurrections, or those who, like ourselves, apply themselves to\r\nsuppressing them?\"\r\n\r\nThese measures, these laws and this language pleased the Conservatives\r\nwithout satisfying them; and to tell the truth, nothing would have\r\ncontented them short of the destruction of the Republic. Their instinct\r\nconstantly impelled them in that direction, although their prudence and\r\ntheir reason restrained them on the road.\r\n\r\nBut what they desired above all things was to oust their enemies from\r\nplace and to instal in their stead their partisans or their private\r\nfriends. We were again brought face to face with all the passions which\r\nhad brought about the fall of the Monarchy of July. The Revolution had\r\nnot destroyed them, but only made them the more greedy; this was our\r\ngreat and permanent danger. Here again, I considered that we ought to\r\nmake concessions. There were still in the public offices a very large\r\nnumber of those Republicans of indifferent capacity or bad character\r\nwhom the chances of the Revolution had driven into power. My advice was\r\nto get rid of these at once, without waiting to be asked for their\r\ndismissal, in such a way as to inspire confidence in our intentions and\r\nto acquire the right to defend all the honest and capable Republicans;\r\nbut I could never induce Dufaure to consent to this. He had already held\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior under Cavaignac. Many of the public\r\nservants whom it would be necessary to dismiss had been either appointed\r\nor supported by him. His vanity was involved in the question of\r\nmaintaining them in their positions, and his mistrust of their\r\ndetractors would in any event have sufficed to persuade him to oppose\r\ntheir representations. He accordingly resisted. It was, therefore, not\r\nlong before he himself became the object of all their attacks. No one\r\ndared tackle him in the tribune, for he was too sturdy a swordsman\r\nthere; but he was constantly struck at from a distance and in the shade\r\nof the lobbies, and I soon saw a great storm gathering against him.\r\n\r\n\"What is it we have undertaken to do?\" I often asked him. \"To save the\r\nRepublic with the assistance of the Republicans? No, for the majority of\r\nthose who bear that name would assuredly kill us together with it; and\r\nthose who deserve to bear the name do not number one hundred in the\r\nAssembly. We have undertaken to save the Republic with the assistance of\r\nparties which do not love it. We can only, therefore, govern with the\r\naid of concessions; only, we must never yield anything substantial. In\r\nthis matter, everything depends upon the degree. The best, and perhaps\r\nthe only guarantee which the Republic at this moment possesses lies in\r\nour continuance in power. Every honourable means should therefore be\r\ntaken to keep us there.\"\r\n\r\nTo this he replied that fighting, as he did every day, with the greatest\r\nenergy, against socialism and anarchy, he must satisfy the majority; as\r\nthough one could ever satisfy men by thinking only of their general\r\nwelfare, without taking into account their vanity and their private\r\ninterests. If even, while refusing, he had been able to do so\r\ngracefully: but the form of his refusal was still more disobliging than\r\nthe matter of it. I could never conceive how a man who was so much the\r\nmaster of his words in the tribune, so clever in the art of selecting\r\nhis arguments and the words best calculated to please, so certain of\r\nalways keeping to the expressions which would compel most agreement with\r\nhis thought, could be so embarrassed, so sullen, and so awkward in\r\nconversation. This came, I believe, from his original education. He was\r\na man of much intelligence, or rather talent--for of intelligence\r\nproperly so-called he had hardly any--but of no knowledge of the world.\r\nIn his youth he had led a laborious, concentrated, and almost savage\r\nlife. His entrance into political life had not to any extent changed his\r\nhabits. He had held aloof not only from intrigues, but from the contact\r\nof parties, assiduously occupying himself with affairs, but avoiding\r\nmen, detesting the movement of assemblies, and dreading the tribune,\r\nwhich was his only strength. Nevertheless, he was ambitious after his\r\nfashion, but with a measured and somewhat inferior ambition, which aimed\r\nat the management rather than at the domination of affairs. His manner,\r\nas a minister, of treating people was sometimes very strange. One day,\r\nGeneral Castellane, who was then in great credit, asked for an\r\naudience. He was received, and explained at length his pretensions and\r\nwhat he called his rights. Dufaure listened to him long and attentively;\r\nand then rose, led the general with many bows to the door, and left him\r\nstanding aghast, without having answered a single word. When I\r\nreproached him with this conduct:\r\n\r\n\"I should only have had to say disagreeable things to him,\" he replied;\r\n\"it was more reasonable to say nothing at all!\"\r\n\r\nIt is easy to believe that one rarely left a man of this kind except in\r\na very bad temper.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, he had as a sort of double a permanent secretary who was\r\nas uncouth as himself, and very stupid besides; so that when the\r\nsolicitants passed from the Minister's office into the secretary's, in\r\nthe hope of meeting with a little comfort, they found the same\r\nunpleasantness, minus the intelligence. It was like falling from a\r\nquickset hedge on to a bundle of thorns.\r\n\r\nIn spite of these disadvantages, Dufaure obtained the support of the\r\nConservatives; but he was never able to win over their leaders.\r\n\r\nThe latter, as I had indeed foreseen, would neither undertake the\r\ngovernment themselves nor allow any one else to govern with a free hand.\r\nThey were unable to see without jealousy ministers at the head of\r\naffairs who were not their creatures, and who refused to be their\r\ninstruments. I do not believe that, between the 13th of June and the\r\nlast debates on the Roman question, in other words, during almost the\r\nwhole life of the Cabinet, a single day passed without some ambush being\r\nlaid for us. They did not fight us in the tribune, I admit; but they\r\nincessantly excited the majority secretly against us, blamed our\r\ndecisions, criticized our measures, put unfavourable interpretations\r\nupon our speeches; unable to make up their minds to overthrow us, they\r\narranged in such a way that, finding us wholly unsupported, they were\r\nalways in a position, with the smallest effort, to hurl us from power.\r\nAfter all, Dufaure's mistrust was not always without grounds. The\r\nleaders of the majority wanted to make use of us in order to take\r\nrigorous measures, and to obtain repressive laws which would make the\r\ntask of government easy to our successors, and our Republican opinions\r\nmade us fitter for this, at that moment, than the Conservatives. They\r\ndid not fail to count on soon bowing us out, and on bringing their\r\nsubstitutes upon the scene. Not only did they wish us not to impress our\r\ninfluence upon the Assembly, but they laboured unceasingly to prevent us\r\nfrom establishing it in the mind of the President. They persisted in the\r\ndelusion that Louis Napoleon was still happy in their leading-strings.\r\nThey continued to beset him, therefore. We were informed by our agents\r\nthat most of them, but especially M. Thiers and M. Mole, were constantly\r\nseeing him in private, and urging him with all their might to overthrow,\r\nin concert with them, and at their common expense and to their common\r\nprofit, the Republic. They formed, as it were, a secret ministry at the\r\nside of the responsible Cabinet. Commencing with the 13th of June, I\r\nlived in a state of continuous alarm, fearing every day that they would\r\ntake advantage of our victory to drive Louis Napoleon to commit some\r\nviolent usurpation, and that one fine morning, as I said to Barrot, the\r\nEmpire should slip in between his legs. I have since learnt that my\r\nfears were even better founded than I at that time believed. Since\r\nleaving the ministry, I have learnt from an undoubted source that a plot\r\nwas formed towards the month of July 1849 to alter the Constitution by\r\nforce by the combined enterprise of the President and the Assembly. The\r\nleaders of the majority and Louis Napoleon had come to an agreement, and\r\nthe blow only failed because Berryer, who no doubt feared lest he should\r\nbe making a fool's bargain, refused his support and that of his\r\nfollowers. Nevertheless, the idea was not renounced, but only adjourned;\r\nand when I think that at the time when I am writing these lines, that is\r\nto say, two years only after the period of which I speak, the majority\r\nof these same men are growing indignant at seeing the people violate the\r\nConstitution by doing for Louis Napoleon precisely what they themselves\r\nat that time proposed to him to do, I find it difficult to imagine a\r\nmore noteworthy example of the versatility of men and of the vanity of\r\nthe great words \"Patriotism\" and \"Right\" beneath which petty passions\r\nare apt to cloak themselves.\r\n\r\nWe were no more certain, as has been seen, of the President than of the\r\nmajority. In fact, Louis Napoleon was, for ourselves as well as for the\r\nRepublic, the greatest and the most permanent danger.\r\n\r\nI was convinced of this; and yet, when I had very attentively studied\r\nhim, I did not despair of the possibility of establishing ourselves in\r\nhis mind, for a time at least, in a fairly solid fashion. I soon\r\ndiscovered that, although he never refused to admit the majority leaders\r\nto his presence and to receive their advice, which he sometimes\r\nfollowed, and although he plotted with them when it suited his purpose,\r\nhe nevertheless endured their yoke with great impatience; that he felt\r\nhumiliated at seeming to walk in their leading-strings; and that he\r\nsecretly burned to be free of them. This gave us a point of contact with\r\nhim and a hold upon his mind; for we ourselves were quite resolved to\r\nremain independent of these great wire-pullers, and to uphold the\r\nExecutive Power against their attacks.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem impossible to me, moreover, for us to enter partly into\r\nLouis Napoleon's designs without emerging from our own. What had always\r\nstruck me, when I reflected upon the situation of that extraordinary man\r\n(extraordinary, not through his genius, but through the circumstances\r\nwhich had combined to raise his mediocrity to so high a level), was the\r\nneed which existed to feed his mind with hope of some kind if we wished\r\nto keep him quiet. That a man of this stamp could, after governing\r\nFrance for four years, be dismissed into private life, seemed very\r\ndoubtful to me; that he would consent to withdraw into private life,\r\nseemed very chimerical; that he could even be prevented, during the\r\nlength of his term of office, from plunging into some dangerous\r\nenterprise seemed very difficult, unless, indeed, one were able to place\r\nbefore his ambition some point of view which might, if not charm, at\r\nleast restrain him. This is to what I, for my part, applied myself from\r\nthe beginning.\r\n\r\n\"I will never serve you,\" I said to him, \"in overthrowing the Republic;\r\nbut I will gladly strive to assure you a great position in it, and I\r\nbelieve that all my friends will end by entering into my plan. The\r\nConstitution can be revised; Article 45, which prohibits re-election,\r\ncan be changed. This is an object which we will gladly help you to\r\nattain.\"\r\n\r\nAnd as the chances of revision were doubtful, I went further, and I\r\nhinted to him as to the future that, if he governed France peacefully,\r\nwisely, modestly, not aiming at more than being the first magistrate of\r\nthe nation, and not its corrupter or its master, he might possibly be\r\nre-elected at the end of his term of office, in spite of Article 45, by\r\nan almost unanimous vote, since the Monarchical parties did not see the\r\nruin of their hopes in the limited prolongation of his power, and the\r\nRepublican party itself looked upon a government such as his as the\r\nbest means of accustoming the country to the Republic and giving it a\r\ntaste for it.\r\n\r\nI told him all this in a tone of sincerity, because I was sincere in\r\nsaying it. What I advised him seemed to me, in fact, and still seems to\r\nme, the best thing to be done in the interest of the country, and\r\nperhaps in his own. He readily listened to me, without giving a glimpse\r\nof the impression my language made upon him: this was his habit. The\r\nwords one addressed to him were like stones thrown down a well; their\r\nsound was heard, but one never knew what became of them. I believe,\r\nhowever, that they were not entirely lost; for there were two distinct\r\nmen in him, as I was not long in discovering. The first was the\r\nex-conspirator, the fatalistic dreamer, who thought himself called to\r\ngovern France, and through it to dominate Europe. The other was the\r\nepicurean, who luxuriously made the most of his new state of well-being\r\nand of the facile pleasures which his present position gave him, and who\r\ndid not dream of risking it in order to ascend still higher. In any\r\ncase, he seemed to like me better and better. I admit that, in all that\r\nwas compatible with the good of the public service, I made great efforts\r\nto please him. Whenever, by chance, he recommended for a diplomatic\r\nappointment a capable and honest man, I showed great alacrity in placing\r\nhim. Even when his _protege_ was not very capable, if the post was an\r\nunimportant one, I generally arranged to give it him; but most often\r\nthe President honoured with his recommendations a set of gaol-birds, who\r\nhad formerly thrown themselves in desperation into his party, not\r\nknowing where else to betake themselves, and to whom he thought himself\r\nto be under obligations; or else he attempted to place at the principal\r\nembassies those whom he called \"his own men,\" which most frequently\r\nmeant intriguers and rascals. In that case I went and saw him, I\r\nexplained to him the regulations, which were opposed to his wish, and\r\nthe political reasons which prevented me from complying with it. I\r\nsometimes even went so far as to let him see that I would rather resign\r\nthan retain office by doing as he wished. As he was not able to see any\r\nprivate reasons for my refusal, nor any systematic desire to oppose him,\r\nhe either yielded without complaining or postponed the business.\r\n\r\nI did not get off as cheaply with his friends. These were unspeakably\r\neager in their rush for the spoil. They incessantly assailed me with\r\ntheir demands, with so much importunity, and often impertinence, that I\r\nfrequently felt inclined to have them thrown out of the window. I\r\nstrove, nevertheless, to restrain myself. On one occasion, however, when\r\none of them, a real gallows-bird, haughtily insisted, and said that it\r\nwas very strange that the Prince should not have the power of rewarding\r\nthose who had suffered for his cause, I replied:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, the best thing for the President to do is to forget that he was\r\never a pretender, and to remember that he is here to attend to the\r\naffairs of France and not to yours.\"\r\n\r\nThe Roman affair, in which, as I shall explain later, I firmly supported\r\nhis policy, until the moment when it became extravagant and\r\nunreasonable, ended by putting me entirely into his good graces: of this\r\nhe one day gave me a great proof. Beaumont, during his short embassy in\r\nEngland at the end of 1848, had spoken very strongly about Louis\r\nNapoleon, who was at that time a candidate for the Presidency. These\r\nremarks, when repeated to the latter, had caused him extreme irritation.\r\nI had several times endeavoured, since I had become a minister, to\r\nre-establish Beaumont in the President's mind; but I should never have\r\nventured to propose to employ him, capable as he was, and anxious though\r\nI was to do so. The Vienna embassy was to be vacated in September 1849.\r\nIt was at that time one of the most important posts in our diplomatic\r\nservice, because of the affairs of Italy and Hungary. The President said\r\nto me of his own accord:\r\n\r\n\"I suggest that you should give the Vienna embassy to M. de Beaumont.\r\nTrue, I have had great reason to complain of him; but I know that he is\r\nyour best friend, and that is enough to decide me.\"\r\n\r\nI was delighted. No one was better suited than Beaumont for the place\r\nwhich had to be filled, and nothing could be more agreeable to me than\r\nto offer it him.\r\n\r\nAll my colleagues did not imitate me in the care which I took to gain\r\nthe President's good-will without doing violence to my opinions and my\r\nwishes. Dufaure, however, against every expectation, was always just\r\nwhat he should be in his relations towards him. I believe the\r\nPresident's simplicity of manners had half won him over. But Passy\r\nseemed to take pleasure in being disagreeable to him. I believe that he\r\nconsidered that he had degraded himself by becoming the minister of a\r\nman whom he looked upon as an adventurer, and that he endeavoured to\r\nregain his level by impertinence. He annoyed him every day\r\nunnecessarily, rejecting all his candidates, ill-treating his friends,\r\nand contradicting his opinions with ill-concealed disdain. No wonder\r\nthat the President cordially detested him.\r\n\r\nOf all the ministers, the one who was most in his confidence was\r\nFalloux. I have always believed that the latter had gained him by means\r\nof something more substantial than that which any of us were able or\r\nwilling to offer him. Falloux, who was a Legitimist by birth, by\r\ntraining, by society, and by taste, if you like, belonged at bottom to\r\nnone but the Church. He did not believe in the triumph of the Legitimism\r\nwhich he served, and he only sought, amid all our revolutions, to find a\r\nroad by which he could bring back the Catholic religion to power. He had\r\nonly remained in office so that he might watch over its interests, and,\r\nas he said to me on the first day with well-calculated frankness, by the\r\nadvice of his confessor. I am convinced that from the beginning Falloux\r\nhad suspected the advantages to be gained from Louis Napoleon towards\r\nthe accomplishment of this design, and that, familiarizing himself at an\r\nearly date with the idea of seeing the President become the heir of the\r\nRepublic and the master of France, he had only thought of utilizing this\r\ninevitable event in the interest of the clergy. He had offered the\r\nsupport of his party without, however, compromising himself.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of our entrance into affairs until the prorogation of the\r\nAssembly, which took place on the 13th of August, we did not cease to\r\ngain ground with the majority, in spite of their leaders. They saw us\r\nevery day struggling with their enemies before their eyes; and the\r\nfurious attacks which the latter at every moment directed against us\r\nadvanced us gradually in their good graces. But, on the other hand,\r\nduring all that time we made no progress in the mind of the President,\r\nwho used to suffer our presence in his counsels rather than to admit us\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nSix weeks later it was just the opposite. The representatives had\r\nreturned from the provinces incensed by the clamour of their friends, to\r\nwhom we had refused to hand over the control of local affairs; and on\r\nthe other hand, the President of the Republic had drawn closer to us; I\r\nshall show later why. One would have said that we had advanced on that\r\nside in the exact proportion to that in which we had gone back on the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThus placed between two props badly joined together and always\r\ntottering, the Cabinet leant now upon one, now upon the other, and was\r\nalways liable to tumble between the two. It was the Roman affair which\r\nbrought about the fall.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things when the parliamentary session was resumed\r\non the 1st of October 1849, and when the Roman affair was handled for\r\nthe second and last time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n     FOREIGN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not wish to interrupt the story of our home misfortunes to speak\r\nof the difficulties which we encountered abroad, and of which I had to\r\nbear the brunt more than any other. I shall now retrace my steps and\r\nreturn to that part of my subject.\r\n\r\nWhen I found myself installed at the Foreign Office, and when the state\r\nof affairs had been placed before my eyes, I was alarmed at the number\r\nand extent of the difficulties which I perceived. But what caused me\r\nmore anxiety than anything else was myself.\r\n\r\nI possess a great natural distrust of self. The nine years which I had\r\nspent rather wretchedly in the last Assemblies of the Monarchy had\r\ntended greatly to increase this natural infirmity, and although the\r\nmanner in which I had just undergone the trial of the Revolution of\r\nFebruary had helped to raise me a little in my own opinion, I\r\nnevertheless accepted this great task, at a time like the present, only\r\nafter much hesitation, and I did not enter into it without great fear.\r\n\r\nBefore long, I was able to make a certain number of observations which\r\ntranquillized if they did not entirely reassure me. I began by\r\nperceiving that affairs did not always increase in difficulty as they\r\nincreased in size, as would naturally appear at a cursory glance: the\r\ncontrary is rather the truth. Their complications do not grow with their\r\nimportance; it even often happens that they assume a simpler aspect in\r\nthe measure that their consequences become wider and more serious.\r\nBesides, a man whose will influences the destiny of a whole people\r\nalways finds ready to hand more men willing to enlighten him, to assist\r\nhim, to relieve him of details, more prepared to encourage, to defend\r\nhim, than would be met with in second-rate affairs or inferior\r\npositions. And lastly, the size itself of the object pursued stimulates\r\nall the mental forces to such an extent, that though the task may be a\r\nlittle harder, the workman becomes much more expert.\r\n\r\nI should have felt perplexed, full of care, discouragement and\r\ndisordered excitement, in presence of petty responsibilities. I felt a\r\npeace of mind and a singular feeling of calm when brought face to face\r\nwith larger ones. The sentiment of importance attached to the things I\r\nthen did at once raised me to their level and kept me there. The idea of\r\na rebuff had until then seemed insupportable to me; the prospect of a\r\ndazzling fall upon one of the greatest stages in the world, on which I\r\nwas mounted, did not disconcert me; which showed that my weakness was\r\nnot timidity but pride. I also was not long before perceiving that in\r\npolitics, as in so many other matters--perhaps in all--the vivacity of\r\nimpressions received was not in a ratio with the importance of the fact\r\nwhich produced it, but with the more or less frequent repetition of the\r\nlatter. One who grows troubled and excited about the handling of a\r\ntrifling piece of business, the only one which he happens to have taken\r\nin hand, ends by recovering his self-possession among greater ones, if\r\nthey are repeated every day. Their frequency renders their effect, as it\r\nwere, insensible. I have related how many enemies I used formerly to\r\nmake by holding aloof from people who did not attract my attention by\r\nany merit; and as people had often taken for haughtiness the boredom\r\nthey caused me, I strongly dreaded this reef in the great journey I was\r\nabout to undertake. But I soon observed that, although insolence\r\nincreases with certain persons in the exact proportion of the progress\r\nof their fortunes, it was different with me, and that it was much easier\r\nfor me to display affability and even cordiality when I felt myself\r\nabove, than when I was one of, the common herd. This comes from the fact\r\nthat, being a minister, I no longer had the trouble of running after\r\npeople, nor to fear lest I should be coldly received by them, men making\r\nit a necessity themselves to approach those who occupy posts of that\r\nsort, and being simple enough to attach great importance to their most\r\ntrivial words. It comes also from this that, as a minister, I no longer\r\nhad to do only with the ideas of fools, but also with their interests,\r\nwhich always supply a ready-made and easy subject of conversation.\r\n\r\nI saw, therefore, that I was not so ill fitted as I had feared for the\r\npart I had undertaken to play. This discovery encouraged me, not only\r\nfor the present, but for the rest of my life; and should I be asked what\r\nI gained in this Ministry, so troubled, so thwarted, and so short that I\r\nwas only able to commence affairs in it and to finish none, I would\r\nanswer that I gained one great advantage, perhaps the greatest advantage\r\nin the world--confidence in myself.\r\n\r\nAt home and abroad, our greatest obstacles came less from the difficulty\r\nof business than from those who had to conduct it with us. I saw this\r\nfrom the first. Most of our agents were creatures of the Monarchy, who,\r\nat the bottom of their hearts, furiously detested the Government they\r\nserved; and in the name of democratic and republican France, they\r\nextolled the restoration of the old aristocracies and secretly worked\r\nfor the re-establishment of all the absolute monarchies of Europe.\r\nOthers, on the contrary, whom the Revolution of February had dragged\r\nfrom an obscurity in which they should have always remained,\r\nclandestinely supported the demagogic parties which the French\r\nGovernment was combating. But the chief fault of most of them was\r\ntimidity. The greater number of our ambassadors were afraid to attach\r\nthemselves to any particular policy in the countries in which they\r\nrepresented us, and even feared to display to their own Government\r\nopinions which might sooner or later have been counted as a crime\r\nagainst them. They therefore took care to keep themselves covertly\r\nconcealed beneath a heap of little facts with which they crammed their\r\ncorrespondence (for in diplomacy you must always write, even when you\r\nknow nothing and wish to say nothing), and they were very careful not to\r\nshow what they thought of the events they chronicled, and still less to\r\ngive us any indication as to what we were to conclude from them.\r\n\r\nThis condition of nullity to which our agents voluntarily reduced\r\nthemselves, and which, to tell the truth, was in the case of most of\r\nthem no more than an artificial perfectioning of nature, induced me, so\r\nsoon as I had realized it, to employ new men at the great Courts.\r\n\r\nI should have liked in the same way to be able to get rid of the leaders\r\nof the majority; but not being able to do this, I endeavoured to live on\r\ngood terms with them, and I did not even despair of pleasing them, while\r\nat the same time remaining independent of their influence: a difficult\r\nundertaking in which I nevertheless succeeded; for, of all the Cabinet,\r\nI was the minister who most strongly opposed their policy and yet the\r\nonly one who retained their good graces. My secret, if I must confess\r\nit, lay in flattering their self-conceit while neglecting their advice.\r\n\r\nI had made an observation in small affairs which I deemed very\r\napplicable to greater ones: I had found that the most advantageous\r\nnegociations are those conducted with human vanity; for one often\r\nobtains very substantial things from it, while giving very little\r\nsubstance in return. One never does so well when treating with ambition\r\nor cupidity. At the same time, it is a fact that in order to deal\r\nadvantageously with the vanity of others, one must put his own entirely\r\non one side and think of nothing but the success of his plans, an\r\nessential which will always prove a difficulty in the way of this sort\r\nof commerce. I practised it very happily at this time and to my great\r\nadvantage. Three men thought themselves specially entitled to direct our\r\nforeign policy, owing to the position they had formerly occupied: these\r\nwere M. de Broglie, M. Mole and M. Thiers. I overwhelmed all three of\r\nthem with deference; I often sent for them to see me, and sometimes\r\ncalled upon them to consult them and to ask them, with a sort of\r\nmodesty, for advice which I hardly ever followed. But this did not\r\nprevent these great men from displaying every satisfaction. I pleased\r\nthem more by asking their opinion without following it than if I had\r\nfollowed it without asking it. Especially in the case of M. Thiers, this\r\nmanoeuvre of mine succeeded admirably. Remusat, who, although without\r\nany personal pretensions, sincerely wished the Cabinet to last, and who\r\nhad become familiarized through an intercourse extending over\r\ntwenty-five years with all M. Thiers' weaknesses, said to me one day:\r\n\r\n\"The world does not know M. Thiers well; he has much more vanity than\r\nambition; and he prefers consideration to obedience, and the appearance\r\nof power to power itself. Consult him constantly, and then do just as\r\nyou please. He will take more notice of your deference to him than of\r\nyour actions.\"\r\n\r\nThis is what I did, and with great success. In the two principal affairs\r\nthat I had to conduct during my time of office, those of Piedmont and\r\nTurkey, I did precisely the opposite to what M. Thiers wished, and,\r\nnevertheless, we remained excellent friends till the end.\r\n\r\nAs to the President, it was especially in the conduct of foreign affairs\r\nthat he showed how badly prepared he still was for the great part to\r\nwhich blind fortune had called him. I was not slow in perceiving that\r\nthis man, whose pride aimed at leading everything, had not yet taken the\r\nsmallest steps to inform himself of anything. I proposed to have an\r\nanalysis drawn up every day of all the despatches and to submit it to\r\nhis inspection. Before this, he knew what happened in the world only by\r\nhearsay, and only knew what the Minister for Foreign Affairs had thought\r\nfit to tell him. The solid basis of facts was always lacking to the\r\noperations of his mind, and this was easily seen in all the dreams with\r\nwhich the latter was filled. I was sometimes frightened at perceiving\r\nhow much there was in his plans that was vast, chimerical, unscrupulous,\r\nand confused; although it is true that, when explaining the real state\r\nof things to him, I easily made him recognize the difficulties which\r\nthey presented, for discussion was not his strong point. He was silent,\r\nbut never yielded.\r\n\r\nOne of his myths was an alliance with one of the two great powers of\r\nGermany, of which he proposed to make use to alter the map of Europe and\r\nerase the limits which the treaties of 1815 had traced for France. As he\r\nsaw that I did not believe it possible to find either of these powers\r\ninclined for an alliance of this sort, and with such an object, he\r\nundertook himself to sound their ambassadors in Paris. One of them came\r\nto me one day in a state of great excitement to tell me that the\r\nPresident of the Republic had asked him if, in consideration of an\r\nequivalent, his Court would not consent to allow France to seize Savoy.\r\nOn another occasion, he conceived the idea of sending a private agent,\r\none of his own men,[18] as he called them, to come to a direct\r\nunderstanding with the German Princes. He chose Persigny, and asked me\r\nto give him his credentials; and I consented, knowing well that nothing\r\ncould come of a negociation of this sort. I believe that Persigny had a\r\ntwo-fold mission: it was a question of facilitating the usurpation at\r\nhome and an extension of territory abroad. He went first to Berlin and\r\nthen to Vienna; as I expected, he was very well received, handsomely\r\nentertained, and politely bowed out.\r\n\r\n     [18: \"_Un homme a lui._\"--A.T. de M.]\r\n\r\nBut I have spoken enough of individuals; let us come to politics.\r\n\r\nAt the time when I took up office, Europe was, as it were, on fire,\r\nalthough the conflagration was already extinguished in certain\r\ncountries. Sicily was conquered and subdued; the Neapolitans had\r\nreturned to their obedience and even to their servitude; the battle of\r\nNovara had been fought and lost; the victorious Austrians were\r\nnegociating with the son of Charles Albert, who had become King of\r\nPiedmont by his father's abdication; their armies, issuing from the\r\nconfines of Lombardy, occupied Parma, a portion of the Papal States,\r\nPlacentia, and Tuscany, which they had entered unasked, and in spite of\r\nthe fact that the Grand Duke had been restored by his subjects, who have\r\nbeen but ill rewarded since for their zeal and fidelity. But Venice\r\nstill resisted, and Rome, after repelling our first attack, was calling\r\nall the demagogues of Italy to its assistance and exciting all Europe\r\nwith its clamour. Never, perhaps, since February, had Germany seemed\r\nmore divided or disturbed. Although the dream of German unity had been\r\ndispelled, the reality of the old Teutonic organization had not yet\r\nresumed its place. Reduced to a small number of members, the National\r\nAssembly, which had till then endeavoured to promote this unity, fled\r\nfrom Frankfort and hawked round the spectacle of its impotence and its\r\nridiculous fury. But its fall did not restore order; on the contrary, it\r\nleft a freer field for anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe moderate, one may say the innocent, revolutionaries, who had\r\ncherished the belief that they would be able, peacefully, and by means\r\nof arguments and decrees, to persuade the peoples and princes of Germany\r\nto submit to a single government, made way for the violent\r\nrevolutionaries, who had always maintained that Germany could only be\r\nbrought to a state of unity by the complete ruin of its old systems of\r\ngovernment, and the entire abolition of the existing social order. Riots\r\ntherefore followed on every hand upon parliamentary discussion.\r\nPolitical rivalries turned into a war of classes; the natural hatred and\r\njealousy entertained by the poor for the rich developed into socialistic\r\ntheories in many quarters, but especially in the small states of Central\r\nGermany and in the great Rhine Valley. Wurtemberg was in a state of\r\nagitation; Saxony had just experienced a terrible insurrection, which\r\nhad only been crushed with the assistance of Prussia; insurrections had\r\nalso occurred in Westphalia; the Palatinate was in open revolt; and\r\nBaden had expelled its Grand Duke, and appointed a Provisional\r\nGovernment. And yet the final victory of the Princes, which I had\r\nforeseen when travelling through Germany, a month before, was no longer\r\nin doubt; the very violence of the insurrections hastened it. The\r\nlarger monarchies had recaptured their capitals and their armies. Their\r\nheads had still difficulties to conquer, but no more dangers; and\r\nthemselves masters, or on the point of becoming so, at home, they could\r\nnot fail soon to triumph in the second-rate States. By thus violently\r\ndisturbing public order, the insurgents gave them the wish, the\r\nopportunity and the right to intervene.\r\n\r\nPrussia had already commenced to do so. The Prussians had just\r\nsuppressed the Saxon insurrection by force of arms; they now entered the\r\nRhine Palatinate, offered their intervention to Wurtemberg, and prepared\r\nto invade the Grand-Duchy of Baden, thus occupying almost the whole of\r\nGermany with their soldiers or their influence.\r\n\r\nAustria had emerged from the terrible crisis which had threatened its\r\nexistence, but it was still in great travail. Its armies, after\r\nconquering in Italy, were being defeated in Hungary. Despairing of\r\nmastering its subjects unaided, it had called Russia to its assistance,\r\nand the Tsar, in a manifesto dated 13 May, had announced to Europe that\r\nhe was marching against the Hungarians. The Emperor Nicholas had till\r\nthen remained at rest amid his uncontested might. He had viewed the\r\nagitation of the nations from afar in safety, but not with indifference.\r\nThenceforward, he alone among the great powers of Europe represented the\r\nold state of society and the old traditional principle of authority. He\r\nwas not only its representative: he considered himself its champion.\r\nHis political theories, his religious belief, his ambition and his\r\nconscience, all urged him to adopt this part. He had, therefore, made\r\nfor himself out of the cause of authority throughout the world a second\r\nempire yet vaster than the first. He encouraged with his letters and\r\nrewarded with his honours all those who, in whatever corner of Europe,\r\ngained victories over anarchy and even over liberty, as though they were\r\nhis subjects and had contributed to strengthening his own power. He had\r\nthus sent, to the extreme South of Europe, one of his orders to\r\nFilangieri, the conqueror of the Sicilians, and had written that general\r\nan autograph letter to show to him that he was satisfied with his\r\nconduct. From the lofty position which he occupied, and whence he\r\npeacefully watched the various incidents of the struggle which shook\r\nEurope, the Emperor judged freely, and followed with a certain tranquil\r\ndisdain, not only the follies of the revolutionaries whom he pursued,\r\nbut also the vices and the faults of the parties and princes whom he\r\nassisted. He expressed himself on this subject simply and as the\r\noccasion required, without showing any eagerness to disclose his\r\nthoughts or taking any pains to conceal them.\r\n\r\nLamoriciere wrote to me on the 11th of August 1849, in a secret\r\ndespatch:\r\n\r\n     \"The Tsar said to me this morning, 'You believe, general, that your\r\n     dynastic parties would be capable of uniting with the Radicals to\r\n     overthrow a dynasty which they disliked, in the hope of setting\r\n     their own in its place; and I am certain of it. Your Legitimist\r\n     Party especially would not hesitate to do so. I have long since\r\n     thought that it is the Legitimists who make the Elder Branch of the\r\n     Bourbons impossible. This is one of the reasons why I recognized\r\n     the Republic; and also because I perceive in your nation a certain\r\n     common sense which is wanting in the Germans.'\r\n\r\n     \"Later, the Emperor also said, 'The King of Prussia, my\r\n     brother-in-law, with whom I was on very close terms of friendship,\r\n     has not taken the slightest heed of my advice. The result is that\r\n     our political relations have become remarkably cool, to such an\r\n     extent that they have affected even our family relations. Look at\r\n     the things he has done: did he not put himself at the head of those\r\n     fools who dream of an United Germany, and now that he has broken\r\n     with the Frankfort Parliament, has he not brought himself to the\r\n     necessity of fighting the troops of the Schleswig-Holstein Duchies,\r\n     which were levied under his patronage! Is it possible to imagine\r\n     anything more disgraceful? And now, who knows how far he will go\r\n     with his constitutional proposals?' He added, 'Do not think that,\r\n     because I intervene in Hungary, I wish to justify the conduct of\r\n     Austria in this affair. She has heaped up, one on the other, the\r\n     most serious faults and the greatest follies; but when all is said\r\n     and done, it had allowed the country to be invaded by subversive\r\n     doctrines, and the government had fallen into the hands of\r\n     disorderly persons. This was not to be endured.'\r\n\r\n     \"Speaking of the affairs of Italy, 'We others,' he said, 'see\r\n     nothing in those temporal functions fulfilled in Rome by\r\n     ecclesiastics; but it matters little to us how those priests\r\n     arrange things among themselves, provided that something is set up\r\n     which will last and that you constitute the power in such a way\r\n     that it can stand.'\"\r\n\r\nHereupon Lamoriciere, wounded by this supercilious tone, which smelt\r\nsomewhat of the autocrat and betrayed a sort of rivalry as between pope\r\nand pope, began to defend Catholic institutions.\r\n\r\n     \"'Very well, very well,' said the Emperor, ending the conversation,\r\n     'let France be as Catholic as she pleases, only let her protect\r\n     herself against the insane theories and passions of innovators.'\"\r\n\r\nThough hard and austere in the exercise of his power, the Tsar was\r\nsimple and almost _bourgeois_ in his habits, keeping only the substance\r\nof sovereign power and rejecting its pomp and worries. On the 17th of\r\nJuly, the French Ambassador at St Petersburg wrote to me:\r\n\r\n     \"The Emperor is here; he arrived from Warsaw without suite of any\r\n     kind, in an ordinary post-cart--his carriage had broke down sixty\r\n     leagues from here--so as to be in time for the Empress's\r\n     saint's-day, which has just taken place. He did the journey with\r\n     extraordinary rapidity, in two days and a half, and he leaves again\r\n     to-morrow. Every one here is touched with this contrast of power\r\n     and simplicity, with the sight of this Sovereign who, after hurling\r\n     one hundred and twenty thousand men on to the battle-field, races\r\n     along the roads like a _feld-jaeger_, so as not to miss his wife's\r\n     saint's-day. Nothing is more in keeping with the spirit of the\r\n     Slavs, among whom one might say that the principal element of\r\n     civilization is the spirit of family.\"\r\n\r\nIt would, in fact, be a great mistake to think that the Tsar's immense\r\npower was only based upon force. It was founded, above all, on the\r\nwishes and the ardent sympathies of the Russians. For the principle of\r\nthe sovereignty of the people lies at the root of all government,\r\nwhatever may be said to the contrary, and lurks beneath the least\r\nindependent institutions. The Russian nobles had adopted the principles\r\nand still more the vices of Europe; but the people were not in touch\r\nwith our West and with the new spirit which animated it. They saw in the\r\nEmperor not only their lawful Prince, but the envoy of God, and almost\r\nGod Himself.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this Europe which I have depicted, the position of\r\nFrance was one of weakness and embarrassment. Nowhere had the\r\nRevolution succeeded in establishing a regular and stable system of\r\nliberty. On every side, the old powers were rising up again from amid\r\nthe ruins which it had made--not, it is true, the same as when they\r\nfell, but very similar. We could not assist the latter in establishing\r\nthemselves nor ensure their victory, for the system which they were\r\nsetting up was antipathetic, I will say not only to the institutions\r\ncreated by the Revolution of February, but, at the root of our ideas, to\r\nall that was most permanent and unconquerable in our new habits. They,\r\non their side, distrusted us, and rightly. The great part of restorers\r\nof the general order in Europe was therefore forbidden us. This part,\r\nmoreover, was already played by another: it belonged by right to Russia,\r\nand only the second remained for us. As to placing France at the head of\r\nthe innovators, this was to be still less thought of, for two reasons:\r\nfirst, that it would have been absolutely impossible to advise these\r\nlatter or to hope to lead them, because of their extravagance and their\r\ndetestable incapacity; secondly, that it was not possible to support\r\nthem abroad without falling beneath their blows at home. The contact of\r\ntheir passions and doctrines would have put all France in flame,\r\nrevolutionary doctrines at that time dominating all others. Thus we were\r\nneither able to unite with the nations, who accused us of urging them on\r\nand then betraying them, nor with the princes, who reproached us with\r\nshaking their thrones. We were reduced to accepting the sterile\r\ngood-will of the English: it was the same isolation as before February,\r\nwith the Continent more hostile to us and England more lukewarm. It was\r\ntherefore necessary, as it had been then, to reduce ourselves to leading\r\na small life, from day to day; but even this was difficult. The French\r\nNation, which had made and, in a certain way, still made so great a\r\nfigure in the world, kicked against this necessity of the time: it had\r\nremained haughty while it ceased to be preponderant; it feared to act\r\nand tried to talk loudly; and it also expected its Government to be\r\nproud, without, however, permitting it to run the risks which such\r\nconduct entailed.\r\n\r\nNever had France been looked upon with more anxiety than at the moment\r\nwhen the Cabinet had just been formed. The easy and complete victory\r\nwhich we had won in Paris on the 13th of June had extraordinary rebounds\r\nthroughout Europe. A new insurrection in France was generally expected.\r\nThe revolutionaries, half destroyed, relied only upon this occurrence to\r\nrecover themselves, and they redoubled their efforts in order to be able\r\nto take advantage of it. The governments, half victorious, fearing to be\r\nsurprised by this crisis, stopped before striking their final blow. The\r\nday of the 13th of June gave rise to cries of pain and joy from one end\r\nof the Continent to the other. It decided fortune suddenly, and\r\nprecipitated it towards the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian army, already master of the Palatinate, at once burst into\r\nthe Grand-Duchy of Baden, dispersed the insurgents, and occupied the\r\nwhole country, with the exception of Rastadt, which held out for a few\r\nweeks.[19]\r\n\r\n     [19: Nothing was ever more despicable than the conduct of those\r\n     revolutionaries. The soldiers who, at the commencement of the\r\n     insurrection, had put to flight or killed their officers, turned\r\n     tail before the Prussians. The ringleaders did nothing but dispute\r\n     among themselves and defame one another instead of defending\r\n     themselves, and took refuge in Switzerland after pillaging the\r\n     public treasury and levying contributions upon their own country.\r\n\r\n     While the struggle lasted, we took strong measures to prevent the\r\n     insurgents from receiving any assistance from France. Those among\r\n     them who crossed the Rhine, in great numbers, received asylum from\r\n     us, but were disarmed and placed in confinement. The victors, as it\r\n     was easy to foresee, at once abused their victory. Many prisoners\r\n     were put to death, all liberty was indefinitely suspended, and even\r\n     the government which had been restored was kept in very close\r\n     tutelage. I soon perceived that the French representative in the\r\n     Grand-Duchy of Baden not only did not strive to moderate these\r\n     violences, but thoroughly approved of them. I at once wrote to him\r\n     as follows:\r\n\r\n          \"Sir,\r\n\r\n          \"I am informed that a number of military executions have taken\r\n          place, and that many more are announced. I do not understand\r\n          why these facts have not been reported by you, nor why you\r\n          have not sought to prevent them, without even waiting for\r\n          instructions. We have assisted as much as we could, without\r\n          taking up arms, in suppressing the rebellion; all the more\r\n          reason for desiring that the victory to which we have given\r\n          our aid should not be sullied by acts of violence of which\r\n          France disapproves, and which we regard as both odious and\r\n          impolitic. There is another point which causes us much\r\n          anxiety, and which does not seem to excite your solicitude to\r\n          the same degree: I refer to the political institutions of the\r\n          Grand-Duchy. Do not forget that the object of the Government\r\n          of the Republic in that country has been to assist in putting\r\n          down anarchy, but not in destroying liberty. We can in no way\r\n          lend our hand to an anti-liberal restoration. The\r\n          Constitutional Monarchy felt the need to create or maintain\r\n          free States around France. The Republic is still more obliged\r\n          to do so. The Government therefore asks and imperiously\r\n          insists that each of its agents shall faithfully conform to\r\n          these necessities of our situation. See the Grand Duke, and\r\n          give him to understand what are the wishes of France. We shall\r\n          certainly never allow either a Prussian province or an\r\n          absolute government to be established on our frontier in the\r\n          stead of an independent and constitutional monarchy?\"\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     After some time, the executions ceased. The Grand Duke protested\r\n     his attachment to constitutional forms, and his resolution to\r\n     maintain them. This was for the moment all he was able to do, for\r\n     he reigned only in name. The Prussians were the real masters.]\r\n\r\nThe Baden revolutionaries took refuge in Switzerland. Refugees were then\r\narriving in that country from Italy, France, and to tell the truth, from\r\nevery corner of Europe, for all Europe, with the exception of Russia,\r\nhad undergone or was undergoing a revolution. Their number soon amounted\r\nto ten or twelve thousand. It was an army always ready to fall upon the\r\nneighbouring States. All the Cabinets were alarmed at it.\r\n\r\nAustria and especially Prussia, which had already had reason to complain\r\nof the Confederation, and even Russia, which was in no way concerned,\r\nspoke of invading Swiss territory with armed forces and acting as a\r\npolice in the name of all the governments threatened. This we could not\r\nallow.\r\n\r\nI first endeavoured to make the Swiss listen to reason, and to persuade\r\nthem not to wait till they were threatened, but themselves to expel from\r\ntheir territory, as the Law of Nations required them to do, all the\r\nprincipal ringleaders who openly threatened neighbouring nations.\r\n\r\n\"If you in this way anticipate what they have the right to ask of you,\"\r\nI incessantly repeated to the representative in Paris of the Swiss\r\nConfederation, \"you can rely upon France to defend you against any\r\nunjust or exaggerated pretensions put forward by the Courts. We will\r\nrather risk war than permit them to oppress or humiliate you. But if you\r\nrefuse to bring reason on your side, you must only rely upon yourselves,\r\nand you will have to defend yourselves against all Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThis language had little effect, for there is nothing to equal the pride\r\nand conceit of the Swiss. Not one of those peasants but believes that\r\nhis country is able to defy all the princes and all the nations of the\r\nearth. I then set to work in another way, which was more successful.\r\nThis was to advise the foreign Governments (who were only too disposed\r\nto agree) to refuse for a certain period all amnesty to such of their\r\nsubjects as had taken refuge in Switzerland, and to deny all of them,\r\nwhatever their degree of guilt, the right to return to their country. On\r\nour side, we closed our frontiers to all those who, after taking refuge\r\nin Switzerland, wished to cross France in order to go to England or\r\nAmerica, including the inoffensive refugees as well as the ringleaders.\r\nEvery outlet being thus closed, Switzerland remained encumbered with\r\nthose ten or twelve thousand adventurers, the most turbulent and\r\ndisorderly people in all Europe. It was necessary to feed, lodge, and\r\neven pay them, lest they should levy contributions on the country. This\r\nsuddenly enlightened the Swiss as to the drawbacks attendant upon the\r\nright of asylum. They could have made arrangements to have kept the\r\nillustrious chiefs for an indefinite period, in spite of the danger with\r\nwhich these menaced their neighbours; but the revolutionary army was a\r\ngreat nuisance to them. The more radical cantons were the first to raise\r\na loud clamour and to ask to be rid of these inconvenient and expensive\r\nvisitors. And as it was impossible to persuade the foreign Governments\r\nto open their territory to the crowd of inoffensive refugees who were\r\nable and willing to leave Switzerland, without first driving out the\r\nleaders who would have liked to stay, they ended by expelling these.\r\nAfter almost bringing all Europe down upon them rather than remove these\r\nmen from their territory, the Swiss ended by driving them out of their\r\nown accord in order to avoid a temporary inconvenience and a trifling\r\nexpense. No better example was ever given of the nature of democracies,\r\nwhich, as a rule, have only very confused or very erroneous ideas on\r\nexternal affairs, and generally solve outside questions only by internal\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nWhile these things were happening in Switzerland, the general aspect of\r\naffairs in Germany underwent a change. The struggles of the nations\r\nagainst the Governments were followed by quarrels of the Princes among\r\nthemselves. I followed this new phase of the Revolution with a very\r\nattentive gaze and a very perplexed mind.\r\n\r\nThe Revolution in Germany had not proceeded from a simple cause, as in\r\nthe rest of Europe. It was produced at once by the general spirit of the\r\ntime and by the unitarian ideas peculiar to the Germans. The democracy\r\nwas now beaten, but the idea of German unity was not destroyed; the\r\nneeds, the memories, the passions that had inspired it survived. The\r\nKing of Prussia had undertaken to appropriate it and make use of it.\r\nThis Prince, a man of intelligence but of very little sense, had been\r\nwavering for a year between his fear of the Revolution and his desire to\r\nturn it to account. He struggled as much as he could against the liberal\r\nand democratic spirit of the age; yet he favoured the German unitarian\r\nspirit, a blundering game in which, if he had dared to go to the length\r\nof his desires, he would have risked his Crown and his life. For, in\r\norder to overcome the resistance which existing institutions and the\r\ninterests of the Princes were bound to oppose to the establishment of a\r\ncentral power, he would have had to summon the revolutionary passions of\r\nthe peoples to his aid, and of these Frederic William could not have\r\nmade use without soon being destroyed by them himself.\r\n\r\nSo long as the Frankfort Parliament retained its _prestige_ and its\r\npower, the King of Prussia entreated it kindly and strove to get himself\r\nplaced by it at the head of the new Empire. When the Parliament fell\r\ninto discredit and powerlessness, the King changed his behaviour\r\nwithout changing his plans. He endeavoured to obtain the legacy of this\r\nassembly and to combat the Revolution by realizing the chimera of German\r\nunity, of which the democrats had made use to shake every throne. With\r\nthis intention, he invited all the German Princes to come to an\r\nunderstanding with him to form a new Confederation, which should be\r\ncloser than that of 1815, and to give him the government of it. In\r\nreturn he undertook to establish and strengthen them in their States.\r\nThese Princes, who detested Prussia, but who trembled before the\r\nRevolution, for the most part accepted the usurious bargain proposed to\r\nthem. Austria, which the success of this proposal would have driven out\r\nof Germany, protested, being not yet in a position to do more. The two\r\nprincipal monarchies of the South, Bavaria and Wurtemberg, followed its\r\nexample, but all North and Central Germany entered into this ephemeral\r\nConfederation, which was concluded on the 26th of May 1849 and is known\r\nin history by the name of the Union of the Three Kings.[20]\r\n\r\n     [20: Of Prussia, Saxony and Hanover.--A.T. de M.]\r\n\r\nPrussia then suddenly became the dominating power in a vast stretch of\r\ncountry, reaching from Memel to Basle, and at one time saw twenty-six or\r\ntwenty-seven million Germans marching under its orders. All this was\r\ncompleted shortly after my arrival in office.\r\n\r\nI confess that, at the sight of this singular spectacle, my mind was\r\ncrossed with strange ideas, and I was for a moment tempted to believe\r\nthat the President was not so mad in his foreign policy as I had at\r\nfirst thought him. That union of the great Courts of the North, which\r\nhad so long weighed heavily upon us, was broken. Two of the great\r\nContinental monarchies, Prussia and Austria, were quarrelling and almost\r\nat war. Had not the moment come for us to contract one of those intimate\r\nand powerful alliances which we have been compelled to forego for sixty\r\nyears, and perhaps in a measure to repair our losses of 1815? France, by\r\nplatonically assisting Frederic William in his enterprises, which\r\nEngland did not oppose, could divide Europe and bring on one of those\r\ngreat crises which entail a redistribution of territory.\r\n\r\nThe time seemed so well to lend itself to these ideas that they filled\r\nthe imagination of many of the German Princes themselves. The more\r\npowerful among them dreamt of nothing but changes of frontier and\r\naccessions of power at the expense of their neighbours. The\r\nrevolutionary malady of the nations seemed to have attacked the\r\ngovernments.\r\n\r\n\"There is no Confederation possible with eight and thirty States,\" said\r\nthe Bavarian Foreign Minister, Baron von der Pfordten, to our Envoy. \"It\r\nwill be necessary to mediatize a large number of them. How, for\r\ninstance, can we ever hope to re-establish order in a country like\r\nBaden, unless we divide it among sovereigns strong enough to make\r\nthemselves obeyed? In that case,\" he added, \"the Neckar Valley would\r\nnaturally fall to our share.\"[21]\r\n\r\n     [21: Despatch of the 7th of September 1849.]\r\n\r\nFor my part, I soon dispelled from my mind, as mere visions, all\r\nthoughts of this kind. I quickly realized that Prussia was neither able\r\nnor willing to give us anything worth having in exchange for our good\r\noffices; that its power over the other German States was very\r\nprecarious, and was likely to be ephemeral; that no reliance was to be\r\nplaced in its King, who at the first obstacle would have failed us and\r\nfailed himself; and, above all, that such extensive and ambitious\r\ndesigns were not suited to so ill-established a state of society and to\r\nsuch troubled and dangerous times as ours, nor to transient powers such\r\nas that which chance had placed in my hands.\r\n\r\nI put a more serious question to myself, and it was this--I recall it\r\nhere because it is bound constantly to crop up again: Is it to the\r\ninterest of France that the bonds which hold together the German\r\nConfederation should be strengthened or relaxed? In other words, ought\r\nwe to desire that Germany should in a certain sense become a single\r\nnation, or that it should remain an ill-joined conglomeration of\r\ndisunited peoples and princes? There is an old tradition in our\r\ndiplomacy that we should strive to keep Germany divided among a large\r\nnumber of independent powers; and this, in fact, was self-evident at the\r\ntime when there was nothing behind Germany except Poland and a\r\nsemi-savage Russia; but is the case the same in our days? The reply to\r\nthis question depends upon the reply to another: What is really the\r\nperil with which in our days Russia threatens the independence of\r\nEurope? For my part, believing as I do that our West is threatened\r\nsooner or later to fall under the yoke, or at least under the direct and\r\nirresistible influence of the Tsars, I think that our first object\r\nshould be to favour the union of all the German races in order to oppose\r\nit to that influence. The conditions of the world are new; we must\r\nchange our old maxims and not fear to strengthen our neighbours, so that\r\nthey may one day be in a condition with us to repel the common enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor of Russia, on his side, saw how great an obstacle an United\r\nGermany would prove in his way. Lamoriciere, in one of his private\r\nletters, informed me that the Emperor had said to him with his ordinary\r\ncandour and arrogance:\r\n\r\n\"If the unity of Germany, which doubtless you wish for no more than I\r\ndo, ever becomes a fact, there will be needed, in order to manage it, a\r\nman capable of what Napoleon himself was not able to do; and if this man\r\nwere found, if that armed mass developed into a menace, it would then\r\nbecome your affair and mine.\"\r\n\r\nBut when I put these questions to myself, the time had not come to solve\r\nthem nor even to discuss them, for Germany was of its own accord\r\nirresistibly returning to its old constitution and to the old anarchy\r\nof its powers. The Frankfort Parliament's attempt in favour of unity had\r\nfallen through. That made by the King of Prussia was destined to meet\r\nwith the same fate.\r\n\r\nIt was the dread of the Revolution which alone had driven the German\r\nPrinces into Frederic William's arms. In the measure that, thanks to the\r\nefforts of the Prussians, the Revolution was on all sides suppressed and\r\nceased to make itself feared, the allies (one might almost say the new\r\nsubjects) of Prussia aimed at recovering their independence. The King of\r\nPrussia's enterprise was of that unfortunate kind in which success\r\nitself interferes with triumph, and to compare large things with\r\nsmaller, I would say that his history was not unlike ours, and that,\r\nlike ourselves, he was doomed to strike upon a rock so soon as, and for\r\nthe reason that, he had re-established order. The princes who had\r\nadhered to what was known as the Prussian hegemony seized the first\r\nopportunity to renounce it. Austria supplied this opportunity, when,\r\nafter defeating the Hungarians, she was able to re-appear upon the scene\r\nof German affairs with her material power and that of the memories which\r\nattached to her name. This is what happened in the course of September\r\n1849. When the King of Prussia found himself face to face with that\r\npowerful rival, behind whom he caught sight of Russia, his courage\r\nsuddenly failed him, as I expected, and he returned to his old part.\r\nThe German Constitution of 1815 resumed its empire, the Diet its\r\nsittings; and soon, of all that great movement of 1848, there remained\r\nbut two traces visible in Germany: a greater dependence of the small\r\nStates upon the great monarchies, and an irreparable blow struck at all\r\nthat remains of feudal institutions: their ruin, consummated by the\r\nnations, was sanctioned by the Princes. From one end of Germany to the\r\nother, the perpetuity of ground-rents, baronial tithes, forced labour,\r\nrights of mutation, of hunting, of justice, which constituted a great\r\npart of the riches of the nobility, remained abolished.[22] The Kings\r\nwere restored, but the aristocracies did not recover from the blow that\r\nhad been struck them.[23]\r\n\r\n     [22: Private letter from Beaumont at Vienna, 10 October\r\n     1849.--Despatch from M. Lefebre at Munich, 23 July 1849.]\r\n\r\n     [23: I had foreseen from the commencement that Austria and Prussia\r\n     would soon return to their former sphere and fall back in each case\r\n     within the influence of Russia. I find this provision set forth in\r\n     the instructions which I gave to one of our ambassadors to Germany\r\n     on the 24th of July, before the events which I have described had\r\n     taken place. These instructions are drawn up in my own hand, as\r\n     were all my more important despatches. I read as follows:\r\n\r\n          \"I know that the malady which is ravaging all the old\r\n          European society is incurable, that in changing its symptoms\r\n          it does not change in character, and that all the old powers\r\n          are, to a greater or lesser extent, threatened with\r\n          modification or destruction. But I am inclined to believe\r\n          that the next event will be the strengthening of authority\r\n          throughout Europe. It would not be impossible that, under the\r\n          pressure of a common instinct of defence or under the common\r\n          influence of recent occurrences, Russia should be willing and\r\n          able to bring about harmony between North and South Germany\r\n          and to reconcile Austria and Prussia, and that all this great\r\n          movement should merely resolve itself into a new alliance of\r\n          principles between the three monarchies at the expense of the\r\n          secondary governments and the liberty of the citizens.\r\n          Consider the situation from this point of view, and give me\r\n          an account of your observations.\"]\r\n\r\nConvinced at an early date that we had no part to play in this internal\r\ncrisis in Germany, I only applied myself to living on good terms with\r\nthe several contending parties. I especially kept up friendly relations\r\nwith Austria, whose concurrence was necessary to us, as I will explain\r\nlater, in the Roman business. I first strove to bring to a happy\r\nconclusion the negociations which had long been pending between Austria\r\nand Piedmont; I put the more care into this because I was persuaded\r\nthat, so long as no lasting peace was established on that side, Europe\r\nwould remain unsettled and liable at any moment to be thrown into great\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nPiedmont had been negociating to no purpose since the battle of Novara.\r\nAustria at first tried to lay down unacceptable conditions. Piedmont, on\r\nher side, kept up pretensions which the state of her fortunes did not\r\nauthorize. The negociations, several times interrupted, had been resumed\r\nbefore I took office. We had many very strong reasons to desire that\r\nthis peace should be concluded without delay. At any moment, a general\r\nwar might break out in this little corner of the Continent. Piedmont,\r\nmoreover, was too near to us to permit us to allow that she should lose\r\neither her independence, which separated her from Austria, or her\r\nnewly-acquired constitutional institutions, which brought her closer to\r\nus: two advantages which would be seriously jeopardized if recourse were\r\nhad to arms.\r\n\r\nI therefore interposed very eagerly, in the name of France, between the\r\ntwo parties, addressing to both of them the language which I thought\r\nmost likely to convince them. I observed to Austria how urgent it was\r\nthat the general peace of Europe should be assured by this particular\r\npeace, and I exerted myself to point out to her what was excessive in\r\nher demands. To Piedmont I indicated the points on which it seemed to me\r\nthat honour and interest would permit her to give way. I applied myself\r\nespecially to giving her Government in advance clear and precise ideas\r\nas to what it might expect from us, so that it should have no excuse to\r\nentertain, or to pretend to have entertained, any dangerous\r\nillusions[24]. I will not go into details of the conditions under\r\ndiscussion, which are without interest to-day; I will content myself\r\nwith saying that at the end they seemed prepared to come to an\r\nunderstanding, and that any further delay was due merely to a question\r\nof money. This was the condition of affairs, and Austria assured us\r\nthrough her Ambassador in Paris of her conciliatory dispositions; I\r\nalready looked upon peace as concluded, when I unexpectedly learned that\r\nthe Austrian Plenipotentiary had suddenly changed his attitude and his\r\nlanguage, had delivered on the 19th of July a very serious ultimatum,\r\ncouched in exceedingly harsh terms, and had only given four days in\r\nwhich to reply to it. At the end of these four days the armistice was to\r\nbe raised and the war resumed. Already Marshal Radetzky was\r\nconcentrating his army and preparing to enter upon a fresh campaign.\r\nThis news, so contrary to the pacific assurances which we had received,\r\nwas to me a great source of surprise and indignation. Demands so\r\nexorbitant, delivered in such arrogant and violent terms, seemed to\r\nannounce that peace was not Austria's only object, but that she aimed\r\nrather at the independence of Piedmont and perhaps at her representative\r\ninstitutions; for so long as liberty shows itself in the smallest\r\nfraction of Italy, Austria feels ill at ease in all the rest.\r\n\r\n     [24: Despatch of the 4th of July 1849 to M. de Boislecomte:\r\n\r\n          \"The conditions laid down for Piedmont by His Majesty the\r\n          Emperor of Austria are no doubt severe; but, nevertheless,\r\n          they do not affect the integrity of the territory of the\r\n          Kingdom nor her honour. They neither take away the strength\r\n          which she should preserve, nor the just influence which she\r\n          is called upon to exercise over the general policy of Europe\r\n          and in particular over the affairs of Italy. The treaty which\r\n          she is asked to sign is a vexatious one, no doubt; but it is\r\n          not a disastrous one; and, after the fate of arms has been\r\n          decided, it does not exceed what was naturally to be feared.\r\n\r\n          \"France has not neglected, and will not neglect, any effort to\r\n          obtain a mitigation of this proposal; she will persist in her\r\n          endeavours to obtain from the Austrian Government the\r\n          modifications which she considers in keeping not only with the\r\n          interests of Piedmont but with the easy and lasting\r\n          maintenance of the general peace; and to attain this result,\r\n          she will employ all the means supplied to diplomacy: but she\r\n          will not go beyond this. She does not think that, within the\r\n          limits of the question and the degree to which the interests\r\n          of Piedmont are involved, it would be opportune to do more.\r\n          Holding this firm and deliberate opinion, she does not\r\n          hesitate to give utterance to it. To allow, even by her\r\n          silence, a belief to gain ground in extreme resolutions that\r\n          have not been taken; to suggest hopes that we are not certain\r\n          of wishing to realize; to urge indirectly by words to a line\r\n          of action which we should not think ourselves justified in\r\n          supporting by our acts; in a word, to engage others without\r\n          engaging ourselves, or unconsciously to engage ourselves more\r\n          deeply than we think or than we mean: that would be, on the\r\n          part of either the Government or of private individuals, a\r\n          line of conduct which seems to me neither prudent nor\r\n          honourable.\r\n\r\n          \"You can rely, Sir, that so long as I occupy the post in which\r\n          the President's confidence has placed me, the Government of\r\n          the Republic shall incur no such reproach; it will announce\r\n          nothing that it will not be prepared to carry out; it will\r\n          make no promises that it is not resolved to keep; and it will\r\n          consider it as much a point of honour to declare beforehand\r\n          what it is not ready to do as to execute promptly and with\r\n          vigour that which it has said it would do.\r\n\r\n          \"You will be good enough to read this despatch to M.\r\n          d'Azeglio.\"]\r\n\r\nI at once came to the conclusion that we must at no price allow so near\r\na neighbour to be oppressed, deliver a territory which touched our\r\nfrontiers to the Austrian armies, or permit political liberty to be\r\nabolished in the only country in which, since 1848, it had showed itself\r\nmoderate. I thought, moreover, that Austria's mode of procedure towards\r\nus showed either an intention to deceive us or else a desire to try how\r\nfar our toleration would go, or, as is commonly said, to sound us.\r\n\r\nI saw that this was one of those extreme circumstances, which I had\r\nfaced beforehand, where it became my duty to risk not only my portfolio\r\n(which, to tell the truth, was not risking much) but the fortunes of\r\nFrance. I proceeded to the Council and explained the state of affairs.\r\n\r\nThe President and all my colleagues were unanimous in thinking that I\r\nought to act. Orders were immediately telegraphed to concentrate the\r\nArmy of Lyons at the foot of the Alps, and so soon as I returned home, I\r\nmyself wrote (for the flaccid style of diplomacy was not suited to the\r\ncircumstances) the following letter:[25]\r\n\r\n     \"Should the Austrian Government persist in the unreasonable demands\r\n     mentioned in your telegram of yesterday, and, abandoning the limits\r\n     of diplomatic discussion, throw up the armistice and undertake, as\r\n     it says it will, to go and dictate peace at Turin, Piedmont can be\r\n     assured that we should not desert her. The situation would no\r\n     longer be the same as that in which she placed itself before the\r\n     battle of Novara, when she spontaneously resumed her arms and\r\n     renewed the war against our advice. This time it would be Austria\r\n     which would herself take the initiative unprovoked; the nature of\r\n     her demands and the violence of her proceedings would give us\r\n     reason to believe that she is not acting solely with a view to\r\n     peace, but that she is threatening the integrity of Piedmontese\r\n     territory or, at the very least, the independence of the Sardinian\r\n     Government.\r\n\r\n     \"We will not allow such designs as these to be accomplished at our\r\n     gates. If, under these conditions, Piedmont is attacked, we will\r\n     defend her.\"\r\n\r\n     [25: Letter to M. de Boislecomte, 25 July 1849.]\r\n\r\nI moreover thought it my duty to send for the Austrian representative (a\r\nlittle diplomatist very like a fox in appearance as well as in nature),\r\nand, convinced that, in the attitude we were taking up, hastiness was\r\nidentical with prudence, I took advantage of the fact that I could not\r\nas yet be expected to have become familiar with habits of diplomatic\r\nreserve, to express to him our surprise and our dissatisfaction in\r\nterms so rude that he since admitted to me that he had never been so\r\nreceived in his life.\r\n\r\nBefore the despatch of which I have quoted a few lines had reached\r\nTurin, the two Powers had come to an agreement. They had come to terms\r\non the question of money, which was arranged practically on the\r\nconditions that had been previously suggested by ourselves. The Austrian\r\nGovernment had only desired to precipitate the negociations by\r\nfrightening the other side; it made very little difficulty about the\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nPrince Schwarzenberg sent me all sorts of explanations and excuses, and\r\npeace was definitely signed on the 6th of August, a peace hardly hoped\r\nfor by Piedmont after so many mistakes and misfortunes, since it assured\r\nher more advantages than she had at first ventured to demand.\r\n\r\nThis affair threw into great relief the habits of English, and\r\nparticularly of Palmerstonian, diplomacy: the feature is worth quoting.\r\nSince the commencement of the negociation, the British Government had\r\nnever ceased to show great animosity against Austria, and loudly to\r\nencourage the Piedmontese not to submit to the conditions which she\r\nsought to force upon them. My first care, after taking the resolutions I\r\nhave described, was to communicate them to England, and to endeavour to\r\npersuade her to take up the same line of conduct. I therefore sent a\r\ncopy of my despatch to Drouyn de Lhuys, who was then Ambassador in\r\nLondon, and instructed him to show it to Lord Palmerston, and to\r\ndiscover that minister's intentions. Drouyn de Lhuys replied:[26]\r\n\r\n     \"While I was informing Lord Palmerston of your resolutions and of\r\n     the instructions you had sent M. de Boislecomte, he listened with\r\n     every sign of eager assent; but when I said, 'You see, my lord, how\r\n     far we wish to go; can you tell me how far you will go yourself?'\r\n     Lord Palmerston at once replied, 'The British Government, whose\r\n     interest in this business is not equal to yours, will not lend the\r\n     Piedmontese Government more than a diplomatic assistance and a\r\n     moral support.\"\r\n\r\n     [26: Despatches of the 25th and 26th of June 1849.]\r\n\r\nIs not this characteristic? England, protected against the revolutionary\r\nsickness of nations by the wisdom of her laws and the strength of her\r\nancient customs, and against the anger of princes by her power and her\r\nisolation in the midst of us, is always pleased to play the part of the\r\nadvocate of liberty and justice in the internal affairs of the\r\nContinent. She likes to censure and even to insult the strong, to\r\njustify and encourage the weak; but it seems that she does not care to\r\ngo further than to assume virtuous airs and discuss honourable theories.\r\nShould her _proteges_ come to need her, she offers her moral support.\r\n\r\nI add, in order to finish the subject, that these tactics succeeded\r\nremarkably well. The Piedmontese remained convinced that England alone\r\nhad defended them, and that we had very nearly abandoned them. She\r\nremained very popular in Turin, and France very much suspected. For\r\nnations are like men, they love still more that which flatters their\r\npassions than that which serves their interests.\r\n\r\nHardly had we emerged from this bad pass, before we fell into a worse\r\none. We had witnessed with fear and regret what was happening in\r\nHungary. The misfortunes of this unlucky people excited our sympathies.\r\nThe intervention of the Russians, which for a time subordinated Austria\r\nto the Tsar, and caused the hand of the latter to be more and more\r\nactive in the management of the general affairs of Europe, was not\r\ncalculated to please us. But all these events happened beyond our reach,\r\nand we were helpless.\r\n\r\n     \"I need not tell you,\" I wrote in the instructions I sent\r\n     Lamoriciere, \"with what keen and melancholy interest we follow\r\n     events in Hungary. Unfortunately, for the present, we can only take\r\n     a passive part in this question. The letter and spirit of the\r\n     treaties open out to us no right of intervention. Besides, our\r\n     distance from the seat of war must impose upon us, in the present\r\n     state of our affairs and of those of Europe, a certain reserve.\r\n     Since we are not able to speak or act to good purpose, it is due to\r\n     our dignity not to display, in respect to this question, any\r\n     sterile excitement or impotent good-feeling. Our duty with regard\r\n     to Hungarian events is to limit ourselves to carefully observing\r\n     what happens and seeking to discover what is likely to take place.\"\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed by numbers, the Hungarians were either conquered or\r\nsurrendering, and their principal leaders, as well as a certain number\r\nof Polish generals who had joined their cause, crossed the Danube at the\r\nend of August, and threw themselves into the arms of the Turks at\r\nWiddin. From there, the two principal ones, Dembinski and Kossuth, wrote\r\nto our Ambassador in Constantinople.[27] The habits and peculiarities of\r\nmind of these two men were betrayed in their letters. The soldier's was\r\nshort and simple; the lawyer-orator's long and ornate. I remember one of\r\nhis phrases, among others, in which he said, \"As a good Christian, I\r\nhave chosen the unspeakable sorrow of exile rather than the peacefulness\r\nof death.\" Both ended by asking for the protection of France.\r\n\r\n     [27: Letters of the 22nd and 24th of August 1849.]\r\n\r\nWhile the outlaws were imploring our aid, the Austrian and Russian\r\nAmbassadors appeared before the Divan and asked that they might be given\r\nup. Austria based her demand upon the treaty of Belgrade, which in no\r\nway established her right; and Russia hers upon the treaty of Kainardji\r\n(10 July 1774), of which the meaning, to say the least of it, was very\r\nobscure. But at bottom they neither of them appealed to an international\r\nright, but to a better known and more practical right, that of the\r\nstrongest. This was made clear by their acts and their language. The two\r\nembassies declared from the commencement that it was a question of peace\r\nor war. Without consenting to discuss the matter, they insisted upon a\r\nreply of yes or no, and declared that if this reply was in the negative,\r\nthey would at once cease all diplomatic relations with Turkey.\r\n\r\nTo this exhibition of violence, the Turkish ministers replied, with\r\ngentleness, that Turkey was a neutral country; that the law of nations\r\nforbade them to hand over outlaws who had taken refuge on their\r\nterritory; and that the Austrians and Russians had often quoted the same\r\nlaw against them when Mussulman rebels had sought an asylum in Hungary,\r\nTransylvania or Bessarabia. They modestly submitted that what was\r\npermitted on the left bank of the Danube seemed as though it should also\r\nbe permitted on the right bank. They ended by protesting that what they\r\nwere asked to do was opposed to their honour and their religion, that\r\nthey would gladly undertake to keep the refugees under restraint and\r\nplace them where they could do no mischief, but that they could never\r\nconsent to deliver them to the executioner.\r\n\r\n     \"The young Sultan,\" our ambassador wrote to me, \"replied yesterday\r\n     to the Austrian Envoy that, while denouncing what the Hungarian\r\n     rebels had done, he could now only regard them as unhappy men\r\n     seeking to escape death, and that humanity forbade him to surrender\r\n     them. Rechid Pasha, on his part, the Grand Vizier,\" added our\r\n     Minister, \"said to me, 'I shall be proud if I am driven from power\r\n     for this;' and he added, with an air of deep concern, 'In our\r\n     religion, every man who asks for mercy is bound to obtain it.'\"\r\n\r\nThis was talking like civilized people and Christians. The Ambassadors\r\nwere content to reply like real Turks, saying that they must give up the\r\nfugitives or undergo the consequences of a rupture which would probably\r\nlead to war. The Mussulman population itself took fire; it approved of\r\nand supported its Government; and the Mufti came to thank our Ambassador\r\nfor the support he had given to the cause of humanity and good law.\r\n\r\nFrom the commencement of the discussion, the Divan had addressed itself\r\nto the Ambassadors of France and England. It appealed to public opinion\r\nin the two great countries which they represented, asked their advice,\r\nand besought their help in the event of the Northern Powers executing\r\ntheir threats. The Ambassadors at once replied that in their opinion\r\nAustria and Russia were exceeding their rights; and they encouraged the\r\nTurkish Government in its resistance.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, arrived at Constantinople an aide-de-camp of the\r\nTsar. He brought a letter which that Prince had taken the pains to write\r\nto the Sultan with his own hand, asking for the extradition of the Poles\r\nwho had served six months before in the Hungarian war against the\r\nRussian army. This step seems a very strange one when one does not see\r\nthrough the particular reasons which influenced the Tsar under the\r\ncircumstance. The following extract from a letter of Lamoriciere's\r\ndescribes them with great sagacity, and shows to what extent public\r\nopinion is dreaded at that end of Europe, where one would think that it\r\nwas neither an organ nor a power:\r\n\r\n     \"The Hungarian war, as you know,\" he wrote,[28] \"was embarked upon\r\n     to sustain Austria, who is hated as a people and not respected as a\r\n     government; and it was very unpopular. It brought in nothing, and\r\n     cost eighty-four millions of francs. The Russians hoped to bring\r\n     back Bem, Dembinski, and the other Poles to Poland, as the price of\r\n     the sacrifices of the campaign. Especially in the army, there\r\n     reigned a veritable fury against these men. The people and soldiers\r\n     were mad with longing for this satisfaction of their somewhat\r\n     barbaric national pride. The Emperor, in spite of his omnipotence,\r\n     is obliged to attach great value to the spirit of the masses upon\r\n     whom he leans, and who constitute his real force. It is not simply\r\n     a question of individual self-love: the national sentiment of the\r\n     country and the army is at stake.\"\r\n\r\n     [28: Despatches of the 11th and 25th of October 1849.]\r\n\r\nThese were, no doubt, the considerations which prompted the Tsar to take\r\nthe dangerous step I have mentioned. Prince Radziwill presented his\r\nletter, but obtained nothing. He left forthwith, haughtily refusing a\r\nsecond audience, which was offered him to take his leave; and the\r\nRussian and Austrian Ambassadors officially declared that all diplomatic\r\nrelations had ceased between their masters and the Divan.\r\n\r\nThe latter acted, in these critical circumstances, with a firmness and\r\npropriety of bearing which would have done honour to the most\r\nexperienced cabinets of Europe. At the same time that the Sultan refused\r\nto comply with the demands, or rather the orders, of the two Emperors,\r\nhe wrote to the Tsar to tell him that he would not discuss with him the\r\nquestion of right raised by the interpretation of the treaties, but that\r\nhe appealed to his friendship and to his honour, begging him to take it\r\nin good part that the Turkish Government refused to take a measure which\r\nwould ruin it in the eyes of the world. He offered, moreover, once more,\r\nhimself to place the refugees in a position in which they should be\r\nharmless. Abdul Medjid sent one of the wisest and cleverest men in his\r\nEmpire, Fuad Effendi, to take this letter to St Petersburg. A similar\r\nletter was written to Vienna, but this was to be handed to the Emperor\r\nof Austria by the Turkish Envoy at that Court, thus very visibly marking\r\nthe difference in the value attached to the consent of the two\r\nSovereigns. This news reached me at the end of September. My first care\r\nwas to communicate it to England. At the same time[29] I wrote a private\r\nletter to our Ambassador, in which I said:\r\n\r\n     \"The conduct of England, who is more interested in this affair than\r\n     we are, and less exposed in the conflict that may arise from it,\r\n     must needs have a great influence upon our own. The English Cabinet\r\n     must be asked clearly and categorically to state _how far_ it is\r\n     prepared to go. I have not forgotten the Piedmont affair. If they\r\n     want us to assist them, they must dot their i's. It is possible\r\n     that, in that case, we shall be found to be very determined;\r\n     otherwise, not. It is also very important that you should ascertain\r\n     the opinions produced by these events upon the Tories of all\r\n     shades; for with a government conducted on the parliamentary\r\n     system, and consequently variable, the support of the party in\r\n     power is not always a sufficient guarantee.\"\r\n\r\n     [29: Private letter, 1 October 1849.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the gravity of the circumstances, the English ministers, who\r\nwere at that moment dispersed on account of the parliamentary holidays,\r\ntook a long time before meeting; for in that country, the only country\r\nin the world where the aristocracy still carries on the government, the\r\nmajority of the ministers are both great landed proprietors and, as a\r\nrule, great noblemen. They were at that time on their estates,\r\nrecruiting from the fatigue and _ennui_ of business; and they showed no\r\nundue hurry to return to Town. During this interval, all the English\r\npress, without distinction of party, took fire. It raged against the two\r\nEmperors, and inflamed public opinion in favour of Turkey. The British\r\nGovernment, thus stimulated, at once took up its position. This time it\r\ndid not hesitate, for it was a question, as it said itself, not only of\r\nthe Sultan, but of England's influence in the world.[30] It therefore\r\ndecided, first, that representations should be made to Russia and\r\nAustria; secondly, that the British Mediterranean Squadron should\r\nproceed to the Dardanelles, to give confidence to the Sultan and, if\r\nnecessary, defend Constantinople. We were invited to do the same, and to\r\nact in common. The same evening, the order was despatched to the British\r\nFleet to sail.\r\n\r\n     [30: Private letter from M. Drouyn de Lhuys, 2 October 1849.]\r\n\r\nThe news of these decisive resolutions threw me into great perplexity. I\r\ndid not hesitate to think that we should approve the generous conduct of\r\nour Ambassador, and come to the aid of the Sultan;[31] but as to a\r\nwarlike attitude, I did not believe that it would as yet be wise to\r\nadopt it. The English invited us to do as they did; but our position was\r\nvery different from theirs. In defending Turkey, sword in hand, England\r\nrisked her fleet; we, our very existence. The English Ministers could\r\nrely that, in that extremity, Parliament and the nation would support\r\nthem; whereas we were almost certain to be abandoned by the Assembly,\r\nand even by the country, if things came so far as war. For our\r\nwretchedness and danger at home made people's minds at that moment\r\ninsensible to all beside. I was convinced, moreover, that in this case\r\nthreats, instead of serving to forward our designs, were calculated to\r\nfrustrate them. If Russia, for it was really with her alone that we had\r\nto do, should chance to be disposed to open the question of the\r\npartition of the East by invading Turkey--a contingency that I found it\r\ndifficult to believe in--the sending of our fleets would not prevent the\r\ncrisis; and if it was really only a question (as was probably the case)\r\nof taking revenge upon the Poles, it would aggravate it, by making it\r\ndifficult for the Tsar to retract, and causing his vanity to join forces\r\nwith his resentment.\r\n\r\n     [31: Private letters to Lamoriciere and Beaumont, 5 and 9 October\r\n     1849.]\r\n\r\nI went to the meeting of the Council with these reflections. I at once\r\nsaw that the President was already decided and even pledged, as he\r\nhimself declared to us. This resolve on his part had been inspired by\r\nLord Normanby, the British Ambassador, an eighteenth-century\r\ndiplomatist, who had worked himself into a strong position in Louis\r\nNapoleon's good graces.... The majority of my colleagues thought as he\r\ndid, that we should without hesitation adopt the line of joint action to\r\nwhich the English invited us, and like them send our fleet to the\r\nDardanelles.\r\n\r\nFailing in my endeavour to have a measure which I considered premature\r\npostponed, I asked that at least, before it was carried out, they should\r\nconsult Falloux, whose state of health had compelled him to leave Paris\r\nfor a time and go to the country. Lanjuinais went down to him for this\r\npurpose, reported the affair to him, and came back and reported to us\r\nthat Falloux had without hesitation given his opinion in favour of the\r\ndespatch of the fleet. The order was sent off at once. However, Falloux\r\nhad acted without consulting the leaders of the majority or his friends,\r\nand even without due reflection as to the consequences of his action; he\r\nhad yielded to a movement of impulse, as sometimes happened to him, for\r\nnature had made him frivolous and light-headed before education and\r\nhabit had rendered him calculating to the pitch of duplicity. It is\r\nprobable that, after his conversation with Lanjuinais, he received\r\nadvice, or himself made certain reflections, opposed to the opinion he\r\nhad given. He therefore wrote me a very long and very involved\r\nletter,[32] in which he pretended to have misunderstood Lanjuinais\r\n(this was impossible, for Lanjuinais was the clearest and most lucid of\r\nmen both in speech and action). He revoked his opinion and sought to\r\nevade his responsibility; and I replied at once with this note:\r\n\r\n     \"My dear Colleague,\r\n\r\n     \"The Council has taken its resolution, and at this late hour there\r\n     is nothing to be done but await events; moreover, in this matter\r\n     the responsibility of the whole Council is the same. There is no\r\n     individual responsibility. I was not in favour of the measure; but\r\n     now that the measure is taken, I am prepared to defend it against\r\n     all comers.\"[33]\r\n\r\n     [32: Letter from Falloux, 11 October 1849.]\r\n\r\n     [33: Letter to Falloux, 12 October 1849.]\r\n\r\nWhile giving a lesson to Falloux, I was none the less anxious and\r\nembarrassed as to the part I was called upon to play. I cared little for\r\nwhat would happen at Vienna; for in this business I credited Austria\r\nmerely with the position of a satellite. But what would the Tsar do, who\r\nhad involved himself so rashly and, apparently, so irrevocably in his\r\nrelations towards the Sultan, and whose pride had been put to so severe\r\na test by our threats? Fortunately I had two able agents at St\r\nPetersburg and Vienna, to whom I could explain myself without reserve.\r\n\r\n     \"Take up the business very gently,\" I recommended them,[34] \"be\r\n     careful not to set our adversaries' self-esteem against us, avoid\r\n     too great and too ostensible an intimacy with the English\r\n     Ambassadors, whose Government is detested by the Court at which you\r\n     are, although nevertheless maintaining good relations with those\r\n     ambassadors. In order to attain success, adopt a friendly tone, and\r\n     do not try to frighten people. Show our position as it is; we do\r\n     not want war; we detest it; we dread it; but we cannot act\r\n     dishonourably. We cannot advise the Porte, when it comes to us for\r\n     our opinion, to commit an act of cowardice; and should the courage\r\n     which it has displayed, and which we have approved of, bring it\r\n     into danger, we cannot, either, refuse it the assistance it asks of\r\n     us. A way must therefore be found out of the difficulty. Is\r\n     Kossuth's skin worth a general war? Is it to the interest of the\r\n     Powers that the Eastern Question should be opened at this moment\r\n     and in this fashion? Cannot a way be found by which everybody's\r\n     honour will be saved? What do they want, after all? Do they only\r\n     want to have a few poor devils handed over to them? That is\r\n     assuredly not worth so great a quarrel; but if it were a pretext,\r\n     if at the bottom of this business lurked the desire, as a matter of\r\n     fact, to lay hands upon the Ottoman Empire, then it would certainly\r\n     be a general war that they wanted; for ultra-pacific though we are,\r\n     we should never allow Constantinople to fall without striking a\r\n     blow.\"\r\n\r\n     [34: Private letters to Lamoriciere and Beaumont, 5 and 9 October\r\n     1849.]\r\n\r\nThe affair was happily over by the time these instructions reached St\r\nPetersburg. Lamoriciere had conformed to them before he received them.\r\nHe had acted in this circumstance with an amount of prudence and\r\ndiscretion which surprised those who did not know him, but which did not\r\nastonish me in the least. I knew that he was impetuous by temperament,\r\nbut that his mind, formed in the school of Arabian diplomacy, the wisest\r\nof all diplomacies, was circumspect and acute to the pitch of artifice.\r\n\r\nLamoriciere, so soon as he had heard rumours of the quarrel direct from\r\nRussia, hastened to express, very vividly, though in an amicable tone,\r\nthat he disapproved of what had happened at Constantinople; but he took\r\ncare to make no official, and, above all, no threatening,\r\nrepresentations. Although acting in concert with the British Minister,\r\nhe carefully avoided compromising himself with him in any joint steps;\r\nand when Fuad Effendi, bearing Abdul Medjid's letter, arrived, he let\r\nhim know secretly that he would not go to see him, in order not to\r\nimperil the success of the negociation, but that Turkey could rely upon\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nHe was admirably assisted by this envoy from the Grand Seignior, who\r\nconcealed a very quick and cunning intelligence beneath his Turkish\r\nskin. Although the Sultan had appealed for the support of France and\r\nEngland, Fuad, on arriving at St. Petersburg, showed no inclination even\r\nto call upon the representatives of these two Powers. He refused to see\r\nanybody before his audience of the Tsar, to whose free will alone, he\r\nsaid, he looked for the success of his mission.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor must have experienced a feeling of bitter displeasure on\r\nbeholding the want of success attending his threats, and the unexpected\r\nturn that things had taken; but he had the strength to restrain himself.\r\nIn his heart he was not desirous to open the Eastern Question, even\r\nthough, not long before, he had gone so far as to say, \"The Ottoman\r\nEmpire is dead; we have only to arrange for its funeral.\"\r\n\r\nTo go to war in order to force the Sultan to violate the Law of Nations\r\nwas a very difficult matter. He would have been aided in this by the\r\nbarbaric passions of his people, but reproved by the opinion of the\r\nwhole civilized world. He knew what was happening in England and France.\r\nHe resolved to yield before he was threatened. The great Emperor\r\ntherefore drew back, to the immeasurable surprise of his subjects and\r\neven of foreigners. He received Fuad in audience, and withdrew the\r\ndemand he had made upon the Sultan. Austria hastened to follow his\r\nexample. When Lord Palmerston's note arrived at St Petersburg, all was\r\nover. The best would have been to say nothing; but while we, in this\r\nbusiness, had only aimed at success, the British Cabinet had also sought\r\nfor noise. It required it to make a response to the irritation of the\r\ncountry. Lord Bloomfield, the British Minister, presented himself at\r\nCount Nesselrode's the day after the Emperor's decision became known;\r\nand was very coldly received.[35] He read him the note in which Lord\r\nPalmerston asked, in polite but peremptory phrases, that the Sultan\r\nshould not be forced to hand over the refugees. The Russian replied that\r\nhe neither understood the aim nor the object of this demand; that the\r\naffair to which he doubtless referred was arranged; and that, in any\r\ncase, England had nothing to say in the matter. Lord Bloomfield asked\r\nhow things stood. Count Nesselrode haughtily refused to give him any\r\nexplanation; it would be equivalent, he said, to recognizing England's\r\nright to interfere in an affair that did not concern it. And when the\r\nBritish Envoy insisted upon at any rate leaving a copy of the note in\r\nCount Nesselrode's hands, the latter, after first refusing, at last\r\naccepted the document with an ill grace and dismissed his visitor,\r\nsaying carelessly that he would reply to the note, that it was a\r\nterribly long one, and that it would be very tiresome. \"France,\" added\r\nthe Chancellor, \"has already made me say the same thing; but she made me\r\nsay it earlier and better.\"\r\n\r\n     [35: Letter from Lamoriciere, 19 October 1849.]\r\n\r\nAt this moment when we learnt the end of the dangerous quarrel, the\r\nCabinet, after thus witnessing a happy conclusion to the two great\r\npieces of foreign business that still kept the peace of the world in\r\nsuspense, the Piedmont War and the Hungarian War--at that moment, the\r\nCabinet fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\n     I have recently discovered these four notes in the charter-room at\r\n     Tocqueville, where my grandfather had carefully deposited, by the\r\n     side of our most precious family archives, all the manuscripts of\r\n     his brother that came into his possession. They seemed to me to\r\n     throw some light upon the Revolution of February and the question\r\n     of the revision of the Constitution in 1851, and to merit\r\n     publication together with the Recollections.\r\n\r\n     Comte de Tocqueville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nGUSTAVE DE BEAUMONT'S VERSION OF THE 24TH OF FEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have to-day (24 October 1850) had a conversation with Beaumont which\r\nis worth noting. This is what he told me:\r\n\r\n\"On the 24th of February, at seven o'clock in the morning, Jules\r\nLasteyrie and another [I have forgotten the name which Beaumont\r\nmentioned] came to fetch me to take me to M. Thiers, where Barrot,\r\nDuvergier, and several others were expected.\"\r\n\r\nI asked him if he knew what had passed during the night between Thiers\r\nand the King. He replied:\r\n\r\n\"I was told by Thiers, and especially by Duvergier, who had at once\r\ntaken a note of Thiers' narrative, that Thiers had been summoned at\r\nabout one o'clock; that he had found the King in an undecided frame of\r\nmind; that he had at once told him that he could only come in with\r\nBarrot and Duvergier; that the King, after raising many objections, had\r\nappeared to yield; that he had put off Thiers till the morning; that\r\nnevertheless, as he showed him to the door, he had told him that as yet\r\nno one was bound one way or the other.\"\r\n\r\nEvidently the King reserved the right of attempting to form another\r\ncombination before the morning.\r\n\r\n\"I must here,\" continued Beaumont, \"tell you a curious anecdote. Do you\r\nknow how Bugeaud was occupied during that decisive night, at the\r\nTuileries itself, where he had just received the command-in-chief?\r\nListen: Bugeaud's hope and ambition was to become Minister of War when\r\nThiers should come into power. Things were so turning out, as he clearly\r\nsaw, as to make this appointment impossible; but what preoccupied him\r\nwas to assure his preponderance at the War Office even if he was not at\r\nthe head of it. Consequently, on the night of the 24th of February, or\r\nrather in the early morning, Bugeaud with his own hand wrote to Thiers\r\nfrom the Tuileries a letter of four pages, of which the substance was:\r\n\r\n\"'I understand the difficulties which prevent you from making me your\r\nMinister of War; nevertheless I have always liked you, and I am sure\r\nthat we shall one day govern together. However, I understand the present\r\nreasons, and I give way before them; but I beg you, at least, to give M.\r\nMagne, who is my friend, the place of Under-Secretary of State at the\r\nWar Office.'\"\r\n\r\nResuming his general narrative, Beaumont continued:\r\n\r\n\"When I arrived at the Place Saint-Georges, Thiers and his friends had\r\nalready left for the Tuileries. I hastily followed them, and arrived at\r\nthe same time as they did. The appearance of Paris was already\r\nformidable; however, the King received us as usual, with the same\r\ncopious language and the same mannerisms that you know of. Before being\r\nshown in to him [at least, I believe it was here that Beaumont placed\r\nthis incident], we talked about affairs among ourselves. I insisted\r\nurgently upon Bugeaud's dismissal. 'If you want to oppose force to the\r\npopular movement,' I said, 'by all means make use of Bugeaud's name and\r\naudacity; but if you wish to attempt conciliation and you suspend\r\nhostilities[36] ... then Bugeaud's name is a contradiction.' The others\r\nseconded me, and Thiers reluctantly and with hesitation gave way. They\r\ncompromised the matter as you know: Bugeaud nominally retained the\r\ncommand-in-chief, and Lamoriciere was placed at the head of the National\r\nGuard. Thiers and Barrot entered the King's closet, and I do not know\r\nwhat happened there. The order had been given to the troops everywhere\r\nto cease firing, and to fall back upon the Palace and make way for the\r\nNational Guard. I myself, with Remusat, hurriedly drew up the\r\nproclamation informing the people of these orders and explaining them.\r\nAt nine o'clock it was agreed that Thiers and Barrot should personally\r\nattempt to make an appeal to the people; Thiers was stopped on the\r\nstaircase and induced to turn back, but with difficulty, I am bound to\r\nadmit. Barrot set out alone, and I followed him.\"\r\n\r\n     [36: This clearly shows, independently of what Beaumont told me\r\n     positively, how absolutely the new Cabinet had made up its mind to\r\n     yield.]\r\n\r\nHere Beaumont's account is identical with Barrot's.\r\n\r\n\"Barrot was wonderful throughout this expedition,\" said Beaumont. \"I had\r\ndifficulty in making him turn back, although when we had once arrived at\r\nthe barricade at the Porte Saint-Denis, it would have been impossible to\r\ngo further. Our return made the situation worse: we brought in our wake,\r\nby effecting a passage for it, a crowd more hostile than that which we\r\nhad traversed in going; by the time we arrived at the Place Vendome,\r\nBarrot feared lest he should take the Tuileries by assault, in spite of\r\nhimself, with the multitude which followed him; he slipped away and\r\nreturned home. I came back to the Chateau. The situation seemed to me\r\nvery serious but far from desperate, and I was filled with surprise on\r\nperceiving the disorder that had gained all minds during my absence, and\r\nthe terrible confusion that already reigned at the Tuileries. I was not\r\nquite able to understand what had happened, or to learn what news they\r\nhad received to turn everything topsy-turvy in this fashion. I was dying\r\nof hunger and fatigue; I went up to a table and hurriedly took some\r\nfood. Ten times, during this meal of three or four minutes, an\r\naide-de-camp of the King or of one of the Princes came to look for me,\r\nspoke to me in confused language, and left me without properly\r\nunderstanding my reply. I quickly joined Thiers, Remusat, Duvergier,\r\nand one or two others who were to compose the new Cabinet. We went\r\ntogether to the King's closet: this was the only Council at which I was\r\npresent. Thiers spoke, and started a long homily on the duties of the\r\nKing and the paterfamilias. 'That is to say, you advise me to abdicate,'\r\nsaid the King, who was but indifferently affected by the touching part\r\nof the speech and came straight to the point. Thiers assented, and gave\r\nhis reasons. Duvergier supported him with great vivacity. Knowing\r\nnothing of what had happened, I displayed my astonishment and exclaimed\r\nthat all was not lost. Thiers seemed much annoyed at my outburst, and I\r\ncould not prevent myself from believing that the secret aim of Thiers\r\nand Duvergier had, from the first, been to get rid of the King, on whom\r\nthey could no longer rely, and to govern in the name of the Duc de\r\nNemours or the Duchesse d'Orleans, after forcing the King to abdicate.\r\nThe King, who had struck me as very firm up to a certain moment, seemed\r\ntowards the end to surrender himself entirely.\"\r\n\r\nHere there is a void in my memory in Beaumont's account, which I will\r\nfill up from another conversation. I come to the scene of the\r\nabdication, which followed:\r\n\r\n\"During the interval, events and news growing worse and the panic\r\nincreasing, Thiers had declared that already he was no longer possible\r\n(which was perhaps true), and that Barrot was scarcely so. He then\r\ndisappeared--at least, I did not see him again during the last\r\nmoments--which was very wrong of him, for although he declined the\r\nMinistry, he ought not, at so critical a juncture, to have abandoned the\r\nPrinces, and he should have remained to advise them, although no longer\r\ntheir Minister. I was present at the final scene of the abdication. The\r\nDuc de Montpensier begged his father to write and urged him so eagerly\r\nthat the King stopped and said, 'But look here, I can't write faster.'\r\nThe Queen was heroical and desperate: knowing that I had appeared\r\nopposed to the abdication at the Council, she took my hands and told me\r\nthat such a piece of cowardice must not be allowed to be consummated,\r\nthat we should defend ourselves, that she would let herself be killed,\r\nbefore the King's eyes, before they could reach him. The abdication was\r\nsigned nevertheless, and the Duc de Nemours begged me to run and tell\r\nMarshal Gerard, who was at the further end of the Carrousel, that I had\r\nseen the King sign, so that he might announce officially to the people\r\nthat the King had abdicated. I hastened there, and returned; all the\r\nrooms were empty. I went from room to room without meeting a soul. I\r\nwent down into the garden; I there met Barrot, who had come over from\r\nthe Ministry of the Interior, and was indulging in the same useless\r\nquest. The King had escaped by the main avenue; the Duchesse d'Orleans\r\nseemed to have gone by the underground passage to the water-side. No\r\nnecessity had compelled them to leave the Chateau, which was then in\r\nperfect safety, and which was not invaded by the people until an hour\r\nafter it had been abandoned. Barrot was determined at all costs to\r\nassist the Duchess. He hurriedly had horses prepared for her, the young\r\nPrince and ourselves, and wanted us to throw ourselves all together into\r\nthe midst of the people--the only chance in fact, and a feeble one at\r\nthat, that remained to us. Unable to rejoin the Duchess, we left for the\r\nMinistry of the Interior. You met us on the road; you know the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nBARROT'S VERSION OF THE 24TH OF FEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n(_10 October 1850._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I believe that M. Mole only refused the Ministry after the firing had\r\ncommenced on the Boulevard. Thiers told me that he had been sent for at\r\none in the morning; that he had asked the King to appoint me as the\r\nnecessary man; that the King had at first resisted and then yielded; and\r\nthat at last he had adjourned our meeting to nine o'clock in the morning\r\nat the Palace.\r\n\r\n\"At five o'clock Thiers came to my house to awake me; we talked; he went\r\nhome, and I called for him at eight. I found him quietly shaving. It is\r\na great pity that the King and M. Thiers thus wasted the time that\r\nelapsed between one and eight o'clock. When he had finished shaving, we\r\nwent to the Chateau; the population already was greatly excited;\r\nbarricades were being built, and even a few shots had already been fired\r\nfrom houses near the Tuileries. However, we found the King still very\r\ncalm and retaining his usual manner. He addressed me with the\r\ncommonplaces which you can imagine for yourself. At that hour, Bugeaud\r\nwas still general-in-chief. I strongly persuaded Thiers not to take\r\noffice under the colour of that name, and at least to modify it by\r\ngiving the command of the National Guard to Lamoriciere, who was there.\r\nThiers accepted this arrangement, which was agreed to by the King and\r\nBugeaud himself.\r\n\r\n\"I next proposed to the King that he should dissolve the Chamber of\r\nDeputies. 'Never, never!' he said; he lost his temper and left the room,\r\nslamming the door in the faces of Thiers and me. It was quite clear that\r\nhe only consented to give us office in order to save the first moment,\r\nand that he intended, after compromising us with the people, to throw us\r\nover with the assistance of Parliament. Of course, at any ordinary time,\r\nI should at once have withdrawn; but the gravity of the situation made\r\nme stay, and I proposed to present myself to the people, myself to\r\napprise them of the formation of the new Cabinet, and to calm them. In\r\nthe impossibility of our having anything printed and posted up in time,\r\nI looked upon myself as a walking placard. I must do Thiers the justice\r\nto say that he wished to accompany me, and that it was I who refused, as\r\nI dreaded the bad impression his presence might make.\r\n\r\n\"I therefore set out; I went up to each barricade unarmed; the muskets\r\nwere lowered, the barricades opened; there were cries of 'Reform for\r\never! long live Barrot!' We thus went to the Porte Saint-Denis, where we\r\nfound a barricade two stories high and defended by men who made no sign\r\nof concurrence in my words and betrayed no intention of allowing us to\r\npass the barricade. We were therefore compelled to retrace our steps. On\r\nreturning, I found the people more excited than when I had come;\r\nnevertheless, I heard not a single seditious cry, nor anything that\r\nannounced an immediate revolution. The only word that I heard of grave\r\nimport was from Etienne Arago. He came up to me and said, 'If the King\r\ndoes not abdicate, we shall have a revolution before eight o'clock\r\nto-night.' I thus came to the Place Vendome; thousands of men followed\r\nme, crying, 'To the Tuileries! to the Tuileries!' I reflected what was\r\nthe best thing to do. To go to the Tuileries at the head of that\r\nmultitude was to make myself the absolute master of the situation, but\r\nby means of an act which might have seemed violent and revolutionary.\r\nHad I known what was happening at the moment in the Tuileries, I should\r\nnot have hesitated; but as yet I felt no anxiety. The attitude of the\r\npeople did not yet seem decided. I knew that all the troops were falling\r\nback upon the Chateau; that the Government was there, and the generals;\r\nI could not therefore imagine the panic which, shortly afterwards,\r\nplaced it in the hands of the mob. I turned to the right and returned\r\nhome to take a moment's rest; I had not eaten anything yet and was\r\nutterly exhausted. After a few minutes, Malleville sent word from the\r\nMinistry of the Interior that it was urgent that I should come and sign\r\nthe telegrams to the departments. I went in my carriage, and was cheered\r\nby the people; from there, I set out to walk to the Palace. I was still\r\nignorant of all that had happened. When I reached the quay, opposite the\r\ngarden, I saw a regiment of Dragoons returning to barracks; the colonel\r\nsaid to me, 'The King has abdicated; all the troops are withdrawing.' I\r\nhurried; when I reached the wicket-gates, I had great difficulty in\r\npenetrating to the court-yard, as the troops were crowding out through\r\nevery opening. At last I reached the yard, which I found almost empty;\r\nthe Duc de Nemours was there; I entreated him to tell me where the\r\nDuchesse d'Orleans was; he replied that he did not know, but that he\r\nbelieved that at that moment she was in the pavilion at the water-side.\r\nI hastened there; I was told that the Duchess was not there. I forced\r\nthe door and went through the rooms, which were, in fact, empty. I left\r\nthe Tuileries, recommending Havin, whom I met, not to bring the Duchess,\r\nif he found her, to the Chamber, with which there was nothing to be\r\ndone. My intention had been, if I had found the Duchess and her son, to\r\nput them on horseback and throw myself with them among the people: I had\r\neven had the horses got ready.\r\n\r\n\"Not finding the Princess, I returned to the Ministry of the Interior; I\r\nmet you on the road, you know what happened there. I was sent for in\r\nhaste to go to the Chamber. I had scarcely arrived when the leaders of\r\nthe Extreme Left surrounded me and dragged me almost by main force to\r\nthe first office; there, they begged me to propose to the Assembly the\r\nnomination of a Provisional Government, of which I was to be a member. I\r\nsent them about their business, and returned to the Chamber. You know\r\nthe rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nSOME INCIDENTS OF THE 24TH OF FEBRUARY 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n1\r\n\r\n     _M. Dufaure's efforts to prevent the Revolution of\r\n     February--Responsibility of M. Thiers, which renders them futile._\r\n\r\nTo-day (19 October 1850), Rivet recalled and fixed with me the\r\ncircumstances of an incident well worth remembering.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the week preceding that in which the Monarchy was\r\noverthrown, a certain number of Conservative deputies began to feel an\r\nanxiety which was not shared by the Ministers and their colleagues. They\r\nthought that it was more advisable to overthrow the Cabinet, provided\r\nthat this could be done without violence, than to risk the adventure of\r\nthe banquets. One of them, M. Sallandrouze, made the following proposal\r\nto M. Billault (the banquet was to take place on Tuesday the 22nd) that\r\non the 21st M. Dufaure and his friends should move an urgent order of\r\nthe day, drawn up in consultation with Sallandrouze and those in whose\r\nname he spoke, some forty in number. The order of the day should be\r\nvoted by them on condition that, on its side, the Opposition should give\r\nup the banquet and restrain the people.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, the 20th of February, we met at Rivet's to discuss this\r\nproposal. There were present, as far as I am able to remember, Dufaure,\r\nBillault, Lanjuinais, Corcelles, Ferdinand Barrot, Talabot, Rivet, and\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nSallandrouze's proposal was explained to us by Billault; we accepted it\r\nat once, and drafted an order of the day in consequence. I myself\r\ndrafted it, and this draft, with some modifications, was accepted by my\r\nfriends. The terms in which it was couched (I no longer remember them)\r\nwere very moderate, but the adoption of this order of the day would\r\ninevitably entail the resignation of the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThere remained to be fulfilled the condition of the vote of the\r\nConservatives, the withdrawal of the banquet. We had had nothing to do\r\nwith this measure, and consequently we were not able to prevent it. It\r\nwas agreed that one of us should at once go in search of Duvergier de\r\nHauranne and Barrot, and propose that they should act according to the\r\ncondition demanded. Rivet was selected for this negociation, and we\r\nadjourned our meeting till the evening to know how he had succeeded.\r\n\r\nIn the evening he came and reported to us as follows:\r\n\r\nBarrot had eagerly entered into the opening offered him; he effusively\r\nseized Rivet's hands, and declared that he was prepared to do all that\r\nhe was asked in this sense; he seemed relieved of a great weight on\r\nbeholding the possibility of escaping from the responsibility of the\r\nbanquet. But he added that he was not engaged in this enterprise alone,\r\nand that he must come to an understanding with his friends, without whom\r\nhe could do nothing. How well we knew it!\r\n\r\nRivet went on to Duvergier's, and was told that he was at the\r\nConservatoire of Music, but that he would return home before dinner.\r\nRivet waited. Duvergier returned. Rivet told him of the proposal of the\r\nConservatives and of our order of the day. Duvergier received this\r\ncommunication somewhat disdainfully; they had gone too far, he said, to\r\ndraw back; the Conservatives had repented too late; he, Duvergier, and\r\nhis friends could not, without losing their popularity and perhaps all\r\ntheir influence with the masses, undertake to make the latter give up\r\nthe proposed demonstration. \"However,\" he added, \"I am only giving you\r\nmy first and personal impression; but I am going to dine with Thiers,\r\nand I will send you a note this evening to let you know our final\r\ndecision.\"\r\n\r\nThis note came while we were there; it said briefly that the opinion\r\nexpressed by Duvergier before dinner was also that of Thiers, and that\r\nthe idea which we had suggested must be abandoned. We broke up at once:\r\nthe die was cast!\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that, among the reasons for Thiers' and Duvergier's\r\nrefusal, the first place must be given to this, which was not expressed:\r\nthat if the Ministry fell quietly, by the combined effect of a part of\r\nthe Conservatives and ourselves, and upon an order of the day presented\r\nby us, we should come into power, and not those who had built up all\r\nthis great machinery of the banquets in order to attain it.\r\n\r\n\r\n2\r\n\r\n     _Dufaure's conduct on the 24th of February 1848._\r\n\r\nRivet told me to-day (19 October 1850) that he had never talked with\r\nDufaure of what happened to him on the 24th of February; but that he had\r\ngathered the following from conversation with members of his family or\r\nof his immediate surroundings:\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd of February, at about a quarter past six, M. Mole, after\r\nconcerting with M. de Montalivet, sent to beg Dufaure to come and see\r\nhim. Dufaure, on his road to M. Mole's, called on Rivet and asked him to\r\nwait for him, because he intended to come back to Rivet on leaving M.\r\nMole. Dufaure did not return, and Rivet did not see him till some time\r\nafter, but he believed that, on arriving at Mole's, Dufaure had a rather\r\nlong conversation with him, and then went away, declaring that he did\r\nnot wish to join the new Cabinet, and that, in his opinion,\r\ncircumstances called for the men who had brought about the movement,\r\nthat is to say, Thiers and Barrot.\r\n\r\nHe returned greatly alarmed at the appearance of Paris, found his wife\r\nand mother-in-law still more alarmed, and, at five o'clock in the\r\nmorning of the 24th, set out with them and took them to Vauves. He\r\nhimself came back; I saw him at about eight or nine o'clock, and I do\r\nnot remember that he told me he had taken this morning journey. I was\r\ncalling on him with Lanjuinais and Corcelles; but we soon separated,\r\narranging to meet at twelve at the Chamber of Deputies. Dufaure did not\r\ncome; it seems that he started to do so, and in fact arrived at the\r\nPalace of the Assembly, which had, doubtless, been just at that moment\r\ninvaded. What is certain is that he went on and joined his family at\r\nVauves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n     MY CONVERSATION WITH BERRYER, ON THE 21ST OF JUNE, AT AN\r\n     APPOINTMENT WHICH I HAD GIVEN HIM AT MY HOUSE. WE WERE BOTH MEMBERS\r\n     OF THE COMMITTEE FOR THE REVISION OF THE CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thus opened the conversation:\r\n\r\n\"Let us leave appearances on one side, between you and me. You are not\r\nmaking a revisionist but an electoral campaign.\"\r\n\r\nHe replied, \"That is true; you are quite right\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I replied; \"we shall see presently if you are well advised.\r\nWhat I must tell you at once is that I cannot join in a manoeuvre of\r\nwhich the sole object is to save a section only of the moderate party at\r\nthe next elections, leaving out of the calculation many others, and\r\nnotably that to which I belong. You must either give the moderate\r\nRepublicans a valid reason for voting for the Revision, by giving it a\r\nrepublican character, or else expect us to do our best to spike your\r\nguns.\"\r\n\r\nHe agreed, but raised difficulties that originated with the passions and\r\nprejudices of his party. We discussed for some time what was to be done,\r\nand at last we came to the policy which he was following.\r\n\r\nThis is what I said to him on this subject, of which I particularly wish\r\nto retain the impression. I said:\r\n\r\n\"Berryer, you are dragging us all, in spite of ourselves, into a plight\r\nfor which you will have to bear the sole responsibility, you may be\r\nquite sure of that. If the Legitimists had joined those who wished to\r\nfight against the President, the fight might still be possible. You have\r\ndragged your party, in spite of itself, in an opposite direction;\r\nhenceforth, we can no longer resist; we cannot remain alone with the\r\nMontagnards; we must give way, since you give way; but what will be the\r\nconsequence? I can see your thought, it is quite clear: you think that\r\ncircumstances render the President's ascendancy irresistible and the\r\nmovement which carries the country towards him insurmountable. Unable to\r\nfight against the current, you throw yourselves into it, at the risk of\r\nmaking it more violent still, but in the hope that it will land you and\r\nyour friends in the next Assembly, in addition to various other sections\r\nof the party of order, which is not very sympathetic with the President.\r\nThere alone you think that you will find a solid resting-place from\r\nwhich to resist him, and you think that, by working his business to-day,\r\nyou will be able to keep together, in the next Assembly, a group of men\r\nable to cope with him. To struggle against the tide which carries him at\r\nthis moment is to make one's self unpopular and ineligible and to\r\ndeliver the party to the Socialists and the Bonapartists, neither of\r\nwhom you wish to see triumph: well and good! Your plan has its plausible\r\nside, but it fails in one principal respect, which is this: I could\r\nunderstand you if the election were to take place to-morrow, and if you\r\nwere at once to gather the fruits of your manoeuvre, as at the\r\nDecember election; but there is nearly a year between now and the next\r\nelections. You will not succeed in having them held in the spring, if\r\nyou succeed in having them held at all. Between now and then, do you\r\nimagine that the Bonapartist movement, aided, precipitated by you, will\r\ncease? Do you not see that, after asking you for a Revision of the\r\nConstitution, public opinion, stirred up by all the agents of the\r\nExecutive and led by our own weakness, will ask us for something more,\r\nand then for something more still, until we are driven openly to favour\r\nthe illegal re-election of the President and purely and simply to work\r\nhis business for him? Can you go as far as that? Would your party be\r\nwilling to, if you are? No! You will therefore come to a moment when you\r\nwill have to stop short, to stand firm on your ground, to resist the\r\ncombined effort of the nation and the Executive Power; in other words,\r\non the one hand to become unpopular, and on the other to lose that\r\nsupport, or at least that electoral neutrality, of the Government which\r\nyou desire. You will have enslaved yourselves, you will have immensely\r\nstrengthened the forces opposed to you, and that is all. I tell you\r\nthis: either you will pass completely and for ever under the President's\r\nyoke, or you will lose, just when it is ripe for gathering, all the\r\nfruit of your manoeuvre, and you will simply have taken upon\r\nyourself, in your own eyes and the country's, the responsibility of\r\nhaving contributed to raise this Power, which will perhaps, in spite of\r\nthe mediocrity of the man, and thanks to the extraordinary power of\r\ncircumstances, become the heir of the Revolution and our master.\"\r\n\r\nBarrot seemed to me to rest tongue-tied, and the time having come to\r\npart, we parted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\nMany of the actors in the Revolution of 1848 are comparatively unknown\r\nin England.
