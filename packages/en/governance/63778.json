Public opinion never fails, sooner or\r\nlater, to arrive at a just conclusion as to the merits both of\r\nindividuals and actions; and though it may often neglect to preserve a\r\nmeritorious work, never perpetuates a worthless one. Poetry which lashed\r\nwith so remorseless a hand the patriotic proceedings, and held up to\r\nridicule the persons and habits, of the most distinguished Whig leaders,\r\nmust have possessed no common merit to have won the encomiums of such\r\nliberal politicians and such critics as MACKINTOSH and JEFFREY, MOORE\r\nand BYRON.\r\n\r\nMOORE, in his _Life of Sheridan_, observes: “_The Rolliad_ and _The\r\nAnti-Jacobin_ may, on their respective sides of the question, be\r\nconsidered as models of that style of political satire whose lightness\r\nand vivacity give it the appearance of proceeding rather from the\r\nwantonness of wit than of ill-nature, and whose very malice, from the\r\nfancy with which it is mixed up, like certain kinds of fire-works,\r\nexplodes in sparkles”. This criticism might be applied to some of his\r\nown political squibs.\r\n\r\nAs the poems refer to occurrences long since past, a rapid glance at the\r\nstate of events at that time (1797–8) may render them more intelligible\r\nto the generality of readers.\r\n\r\nThe affairs of England were then in a critical position. The ministry of\r\nPITT was carrying on a fierce war with republican France, the necessity\r\nfor which had split the public into two great parties. The liberal party\r\nalleged, that “the whole misfortunes of Europe and all the crimes of\r\nFrance had arisen from the iniquitous coalition of kings to overturn its\r\ninfant freedom;—that, if its government had been left alone, it would\r\nneither have stained its hands with innocent blood at home nor pursued\r\nplans of aggrandizement abroad; and that the Republic, relieved from the\r\npressure of external danger, and no longer roused by the call of\r\npatriotic duty, would have quietly turned its swords into pruning-hooks,\r\nand, renouncing the allurements of foreign conquests, thought only of\r\npromoting the internal felicity of its citizens”.\r\n\r\nThese sentiments, though supported by the extraordinary eloquence of\r\nFOX, SHERIDAN, ERSKINE, and others, had but little weight with the\r\nminister or the great body of the public. It was impossible to deny that\r\nthe power of the French Republic was daily increasing, and threatened\r\nthe subjugation of the greater part of Europe. BUONAPARTE had overrun\r\nItaly, and broken the power of Austria, which, by the treaty of Leoben,\r\nwas compelled to cede the Netherlands to France, allow the free\r\nnavigation of the Rhine, and recognise the independence of the\r\nnewly-erected Italian republics. Spain, also, had declared war against\r\nBritain, which was thus left to contend singly against the power of\r\nFrance; for the Directory had refused the basis of peace proposed by\r\nLORD MALMESBURY, that of a mutual restitution of conquests. To add to\r\nthese embarrassments, during the year 1797 credit became affected, and\r\nthe Bank of England suspended cash payments; mutinies broke out in the\r\nfleets at Spithead and the Nore; and Ireland was on the verge of\r\nrebellion. But the talents of PITT were equal to the occasion, and his\r\npower rose higher than ever, when his prognostications were shortly\r\nafter (in December, 1797) confirmed by the unprovoked attack upon\r\nSwitzerland by the French. The impolicy of this proceeding was equal to\r\nits infamy; for nothing ever done by the revolutionary government\r\ncontributed so powerfully to cool the ardour of its partisans in Europe,\r\nand to open the eyes of the intelligent and respectable classes in every\r\nother country to its ultimate designs. Its effect on the friends of\r\nfreedom in England may be judged of from the indignant protest of SIR\r\nJAMES MACKINTOSH, himself once a warm admirer of the French Revolution,\r\nwho, in his defence of JEAN PELTIER, in 1803, for a libel on BUONAPARTE,\r\ndeclared, “the invasion and destruction of Switzerland an act, in\r\ncomparison with which all the deeds of rapine and blood perpetrated in\r\nthe world are innocence itself”. Even before this, the true character of\r\nthe revolution had been detected by the democratic COLERIDGE, who gave\r\npublic utterance to his feelings of horror and disgust in that noble\r\n_Ode to France_ written in February, 1797. In a word, to say nothing of\r\nher other conquests, France, at the beginning of 1798, had three\r\naffiliated republics at her side, the Batavian, Cisalpine, and the\r\nLigurian; before its close she had organized three more, the Helvetic,\r\nthe Roman, and the Parthenopeian.\r\n\r\nPITT’S influence was further increased by the threatened invasion of\r\nGreat Britain by the French, a proceeding which, as it affected every\r\nclass in the country, raised the national enthusiasm to the highest\r\npitch, inflamed as it already was by the recent glorious victories off\r\nCape St. Vincent and Camperdown. That they were likely to be in earnest\r\nhad been already shown by their expeditions to Bantry Bay and\r\nPembrokeshire, and BUONAPARTE’S boast at Geneva, that “he would\r\ndemocratize England in three months,” proved how much he relied upon the\r\nsupport of the malcontents both in Great Britain and Ireland. The\r\nestimates and preparations for defence were, enormous; taxes, to an\r\nextent utterly unknown before, were laid on; the Volunteer Bill was\r\npassed (SHERIDAN assisting), by which, in addition to the regular army,\r\na hundred and fifty thousand volunteers were, in a few weeks, in arms;\r\nTHE KING was authorized by another bill, in the event of an invasion, to\r\ncall out the levy, _en masse_, of the population; the Alien Bill was\r\nreenacted; and the suspension of the Habeas Corpus Act continued for\r\nanother year.\r\n\r\nBut the genius of one man, however great, can effect but little, unless\r\nsuitably supported by others. The sagacious mind of PITT had long seen\r\nthat his party in Parliament were, with very few exceptions, no match\r\nfor his numerous opponents, powerful both in talent and social position;\r\namong whom were FOX, SHERIDAN, ERSKINE, HORNE TOOKE, WHITBREAD,\r\nNICHOLLS, COURTENAY, FITZPATRICK, the DUKES of NORFOLK and BEDFORD, LORD\r\nSTANHOPE, the DUCHESS of DEVONSHIRE, and others. He was always anxious,\r\ntherefore, to secure whatever available talent presented itself, and\r\nimmediately on their appearance enlisted under his banners CANNING,\r\nJENKINSON, HUSKISSON, and CASTLEREAGH, all men of the same standing, for\r\nthe first three were born in 1770, and the last in 1769.\r\n\r\nThe important assistance of CANNING was immediately felt, for he was, in\r\nthe words of BYRON, “a genius—almost a universal one; an orator, a wit,\r\na poet, a statesman”. Though he entered Parliament at the early age of\r\n23 (in 1793), and attained the post of Under-Secretary of State for the\r\nForeign Department two years after, he was by no means inexperienced\r\neither as a writer or as an orator; for while a student at Eton he had\r\nwon distinction by his contributions to _The Microcosm_, a weekly paper\r\npublished by the more advanced Etonians, and also in the discussions of\r\ntheir Debating Society, which were conducted with strict regard to\r\nparliamentary usages. And afterwards, while studying for the law, he\r\ntook an active part in the proceedings of the debating societies of the\r\nmetropolis, in which he achieved so much reputation as to lead to his\r\nintroduction to PITT, whose party he unhesitatingly joined.\r\n\r\nCANNING early saw the necessity of the Government’s possessing some\r\nliterary engine, which, like the Whig _Rolliad_, published some years\r\nbefore, should carry confusion into the ranks of its enemies. In a lucky\r\nhour he conceived the idea of _The Anti-Jacobin_, a weekly newspaper,\r\ninterspersed with poetry, the avowed object of which was to expose the\r\nvicious doctrines of the French Revolution, and to turn into ridicule\r\nand contempt the advocates of that event, and the sticklers for peace\r\nand parliamentary reform. The editor was WILLIAM GIFFORD, whose vigorous\r\nand unscrupulous pen had been already shown in his _Baviad_ and\r\n_Mæviad_; and among the regular writers were: JOHN HOOKHAM FRERE,\r\nJENKINSON (afterwards EARL OF LIVERPOOL), GEORGE ELLIS (who had\r\npreviously contributed to the Whig _Rolliad_), LORD CLARE, LORD\r\nMORNINGTON (afterwards MARQUIS WELLESLEY), LORD MORPETH (afterwards EARL\r\nOF CARLISLE), BARON MACDONALD, and others. These gentlemen entered upon\r\ntheir task with no common spirit. Their purpose was to blacken their\r\nadversaries, and they spared no means, fair or foul, in the attempt.\r\nTheir most distinguished countrymen, whose only fault was their being\r\nopposed to government, were treated with no more respect than their\r\nforeign adversaries, and were held up to public execration as traitors,\r\nblasphemers, and debauchees. So alarmed, however, became WILBERFORCE and\r\nothers of the more moderate supporters of ministers at the boldness of\r\nthe language employed, that PITT was induced to interfere, and, after an\r\nexistence of eight months, _The Anti-Jacobin_ (in its original form)\r\nceased to exist.\r\n\r\n_The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin_ is not exclusively political. _The\r\nLoves of the Triangles_, a parody on DR. DARWIN’S _Loves of the Plants_,\r\nis, in the opinion of a celebrated critic (Lord Jeffrey) of the highest\r\ndegree of merit; as is also _The Progress of Man_, a parody on PAYNE\r\nKNIGHT’S _Progress of Civil Society_; and _The Rovers_, a burlesque on\r\nthe German dramas then in vogue, the extraordinary plots of which, as\r\nwell as their language, alternately ultrasentimental and domestically\r\nbathotic, well marked them out for ridicule, is distinguished by sharp\r\nwit and broad humour of the happiest kind. CANNING and his coadjutors in\r\nthis piece did a real service to literature, and assisted in a\r\npurification which GIFFORD, by his demolition of the Della Cruscan\r\nschool of poetry, had so well begun. Of _The Friend of Humanity and the\r\nKnife-grinder_ it is unnecessary to speak; perhaps no lines in the\r\nEnglish language have been more effective, or oftener quoted.\r\n\r\nBut CANNING’S greatest power is shown in _New Morality_, which, being\r\nthe last of the series, seems to have been reserved as a concentrating\r\nmedium for his pent-up scorn and contempt of the Whigs and their\r\nadherents. So that their blows fall thick (for he was powerfully\r\nseconded by Frere, Gifford, and Ellis), they care little who suffer from\r\nthem, and the modern reader is surprised to find CHARLES LAMB and other\r\nnon-intruders into politics, figuring as congenial conspirators with TOM\r\nPAINE!\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat difficult to regard PITT in the character of a Wit and a\r\nPoet, as from the narrative of most of his biographers, he might be\r\nconsidered as uniformly cold, stiff, and unbending; but his intimate\r\nfriend WILBERFORCE, in his _Memoirs_, thus describes him: “PITT, when\r\nfree from shyness, and amongst his intimate companions, was the very\r\nsoul of merriment and conversation. He was the wittiest man I ever knew,\r\nand what was quite peculiar to himself, had at all times his wit under\r\nentire controul. Others appeared struck by the unwonted association of\r\nbrilliant images; but every possible combination of ideas seemed always\r\npresent to his mind, and he could at once produce whatever he desired. I\r\nwas one of those who met to spend an evening in memory of Shakespeare,\r\nat the Boar’s Head, Eastcheap. Many professed wits were present, but\r\nPITT was the most amusing of the party, the readiest and most apt in the\r\nrequired allusions.” It is not, therefore, at all unlikely, that he now\r\nand then contributed witty verses to _The Anti-Jacobin_, in addition to\r\nthose which the Editor has, on probable grounds, ascribed to him in the\r\npresent volume.\r\n\r\n“Critical commentary,” says a critic of the previous edition, “on the\r\nmerits of _The Anti-Jacobin_, would be superfluous. Its satire is\r\ndistinguished for the terse language of its poignant personality, which\r\nwas often excessively stinging, but seldom offensively coarse. Its best\r\ncontributors, CANNING and FRERE, were not mere pamphleteers in verse,\r\nlike the writers for _The Rolliad_. They had poetical inspiration and a\r\nsprightly joyousness springing from a genial play of the mental\r\nfaculties. They were ‘Conservatives’ not only in their politics but in\r\ntheir loyal adherence to the ordinances and traditions of classical\r\nEnglish literature. False sentiment, tumid diction, mawkish cant, were\r\nchastised by them with exemplary efficacy. On the fourth edition of the\r\ncomplete work (1799, 2 Vols. 8vo, containing both prose and poetry),\r\nthey placed the epigraph, _Sparsosque recolligit ignes_; and in the very\r\nlast paper (No. 36), the motto on discontinuance was exquisitely happy:—\r\n\r\n                            “‘We shall miss thee;\r\n                    But yet thou shalt have freedom.\r\n                            So to the elements\r\n                    Be free; and fare thou well!’\r\n\r\n“And these lines, taken from _The Tempest_ (probably by CANNING), have\r\nbeen prophetic of the popularity of their witty verse, still quoted and\r\nadmired by all lovers of the genius that is airily elegant and strong.”\r\n\r\n                                                        CHARLES EDMONDS.\r\n\r\n  WATER ORTON, BIRMINGHAM.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   ADDITIONS TO THE PRESENT EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerous new Biographical and other Notes.\r\n\r\n  Additions and Corrections to the List of presumed AUTHORS of “THE\r\n      POETRY”.\r\n\r\n  Selections from the PROSE portion of the work, written by the RT.

From the commencement in July, 1798, to its close\r\n      in 1821. (_The first few vols. contain engravings by Gillray and\r\n      others, and much_ POETRY _is scattered through the volumes_.) 61\r\n      vols. 8vo.\r\n\r\n                                                      London, 1798–1821.\r\n\r\nFor reasons stated on a previous page, CANNING and other political\r\nfriends of PITT thought it prudent to withdraw themselves from the\r\noriginal _Anti-Jacobin_, but by a preconcerted arrangement it was\r\ndetermined that the spirit which had pervaded that work, and which had\r\nhad so powerful an effect on the popular mind, and thereby, in\r\nconnection with Gillray’s caricatures, so undoubtedly strengthened the\r\nhands of the Ministry, should not die, if it could be kept alive by\r\nother and congenial writers. In the words of MR. FOX BOURNE (in his\r\nvaluable work on _English Newspapers_, 1887): “Though _The Anti-Jacobin_\r\nmade its last appearance on July 9, 1798, there was started a few days\r\nbefore a monthly _Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine_ of the same\r\npolitics, but much less brilliant, and more ponderous. Strange to say,\r\nit also was edited by a GIFFORD, or one who so called himself. JOHN\r\nRICHARDS GREEN was a bold and versatile adventurer, who, having to fly\r\nfrom his creditors in 1782, returned from France in 1788, as JOHN\r\nGIFFORD, and was connected with several newspapers [including the\r\nestablishment of _The British Critic_], besides editing _The\r\nAnti-Jacobin Review_. [He also wrote a _History of France_, and other\r\nworks.] Befriended in many ways by PITT, he wrote a four-volume pamphlet\r\n[3 vols. 4to, and also 6 vols. 8vo, both dated 1809], styled the _Life\r\nof William Pitt_, after his patron’s death. JAMES MILL, the friend and\r\nassociate of JEREMY BENTHAM, was glad to earn money in his struggling\r\ndays by writing non-political articles for _The Anti-Jacobin Review_.\r\nWILLIAM GIFFORD, it is hardly necessary to state, besides editing Ben\r\nJonson’s Works, and other useful occupations, was the first editor of\r\n_The Quarterly Review_ in 1809.”\r\n\r\nIn the British Museum are two copies of _The Anti-Jacobin Review and\r\nMagazine_. In one of them the first six vols. contain the Names of the\r\nAuthors of most of the articles, among whom are the REV. JOHN WHITAKER,\r\nauthor of _The History of Manchester_, the REV. SAM. HENSHALL, author of\r\nworks on Domesday Book, the REV. C. E. STEWART, a copious poetaster,\r\netc., and many other clergymen.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  THE NEW ANTI-JACOBIN REVIEW.

About the time when\r\nthe _Anti-Jacobin_ was contemplated, OWEN, who had been the publisher of\r\nBURKE’S pamphlets, failed. The editors of the _Anti-Jacobin_ took his\r\nhouse, paying the rent, taxes, &c., and gave it up to WRIGHT, reserving\r\nto themselves the first floor, to which a communication was opened\r\nthrough WRIGHT’S house. Being thus enabled to pass to their own rooms\r\nthrough WRIGHT’S shop, where their frequent visits did not excite any\r\nremarks, they contrived to escape particular observation.”\r\n\r\n“Their meetings were most regular on Sundays, but they not unfrequently\r\nmet on other days of the week, and in their rooms were chiefly written\r\nthe poetical portions of the work. What was written was generally left\r\nopen upon the table, and as others of the party dropped in, hints or\r\nsuggestions were made; sometimes whole passages were contributed by some\r\nof the parties present, and afterwards altered by others, so that it is\r\nalmost impossible to ascertain the names of the authors. Where, in the\r\nabove notes, a piece is ascribed to different authors, the conflicting\r\nstatements may arise from incorrect information, but sometimes they\r\narise from the whole authorship being assigned to one person, when, in\r\nfact, both may have contributed. If we look at the references, 167, 185,\r\nwe shall see CANNING naming several authors, whereas LORD BURGHERSH\r\nassigns all to one author. CANNING’S authority is here more to be relied\r\nupon. _New Morality_ CANNING assigns generally to the four contributors.\r\nWRIGHT has given some interesting particulars by appropriating to each\r\nhis peculiar portion.”\r\n\r\n“GIFFORD was the working editor, and wrote most of the refutations and\r\ncorrections of the _Lies_, _Mistakes_, and _Misrepresentations_.”\r\n\r\n“The papers on finance were chiefly by PITT: the first column was\r\nfrequently kept for what he might send; but his contributions were\r\nuncertain, and generally very late, so that the space reserved for him\r\nwas sometimes filled up by other matter. He only once met the editors at\r\nWRIGHT’S.”\r\n\r\n“W. UPCOTT, who was at the time assistant in WRIGHT’S shop, was employed\r\nas amanuensis, to copy out for the printer the various contributions,\r\nthat the author’s handwriting might not be detected.”—_E. Hawkins._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n          “THE RIGHT HON. GEORGE CANNING AS A MAN OF LETTERS.”\r\n\r\n[The following is part of a review, under the above title, of the\r\npresent editor’s previous edition of _The Poetry of the Anti-Jacobin_,\r\nand appeared in _The Edinburgh Review_ of July, 1858. It is reprinted in\r\nthe _Biographical and Critical Essays_ of A. HAYWARD, Esq., Q.C., 2\r\nvols., 8vo., 1873. It is introduced here as throwing some additional\r\nlight on the _Writers of the various pieces_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“... We can hardly say of CANNING’S satire what was said of SHERIDAN’S,\r\nthat—\r\n\r\n            “‘His wit in the combat, as gentle as bright,\r\n            Never carried a heart-stain away on its blade’.\r\n\r\nBut its severity was redeemed by its buoyancy and geniality, whilst the\r\nsubjects against which it was principally aimed gave it a healthy tone\r\nand a sound foundation. Its happiest effusions will be found in _The\r\nAnti-Jacobin_, set on foot to refute or ridicule the democratic rulers\r\nof revolutionary France and their admirers or apologists in England,\r\nwho, it must be owned, were occasionally hurried into a culpable degree\r\nof extravagance and laxity by their enthusiasm....”\r\n\r\n“We learn from MR. EDMONDS that almost all his authorities practically\r\nresolve themselves into one, the late MR. W. UPCOTT, and that he never\r\nsaw either of the alleged copies on which his informant relied. As\r\nregards the principal one, CANNING’S own, after the fullest inquiries\r\namongst his surviving relatives and friends, we cannot discover a trace\r\nof its existence at any period. LORD BURGHERSH (the late EARL OF\r\nWESTMORELAND) was under fourteen years of age during the publication of\r\n_The Anti-Jacobin_; and we very much doubt whether either the publisher\r\nor the amanuensis (be he who he may) was admitted to the complete\r\nconfidence of the contributors, or whether either the prose or poetry\r\nwas composed as stated. In a letter to the late MADAME DE GIRARDIN, _à\r\npropos_ of her play, _L’École des Journalistes_, JULES JANIN happily\r\nexposes the assumption that good leading articles ever were, or ever\r\ncould be, produced over punch and broiled bones, amidst intoxication and\r\nrevelry. Equally untenable is the belief that poetical pieces, like the\r\nbest of _The Anti-Jacobin_, were written in the common rooms of the\r\nconfraternity, open to constant intrusion, and left upon the table to be\r\ncorrected or completed by the first comer. The unity of design\r\ndiscernible in each, the glowing harmony of the thoughts and images, and\r\nthe exquisite finish of the versification, tell of silent and solitary\r\nhours spent in brooding over, maturing, and polishing a cherished\r\nconception; and young authors, still unknown to fame, are least of all\r\nlikely to sink their individuality in this fashion. We suspect that\r\ntheir main object in going to WRIGHT’S was to correct their proofs and\r\nsee one another’s articles in the more finished state. Their meetings,\r\nif for these purposes, would be most regular on Sundays, because the\r\npaper appeared every Monday morning. The extent to which they aided one\r\nanother may be collected from a well-authenticated anecdote. When FRERE\r\nhad completed the first part of _The Loves of the Triangles_, he\r\nexultingly read over the following lines to CANNING, and defied him to\r\nimprove upon them:—\r\n\r\n        “‘Lo, where the chimney’s sooty tube ascends,\r\n        The fair TROCHAIS from the corner bends!\r\n        Her coal-black eyes upturned, incessant mark\r\n        The eddying smoke, quick flame, and volant spark;\r\n        Mark with quick ken, where flashing in between,\r\n        Her much-loved _Smoke-Jack_ glimmers through the scene;\r\n        Mark, how his various parts together tend,\r\n        Point to one purpose,—in one object end;\r\n        The spiral grooves in smooth meanders flow,\r\n        Drags the long chain, the polished axles glow,\r\n        While slowly circumvolves the piece of beef below:’\r\n\r\n“CANNING took the pen and added—\r\n\r\n          “‘The conscious fire with bickering radiance burns,\r\n          Eyes the rich joint, and roasts it as it turns’.\r\n\r\n“These two lines are now blended with the original text, and constitute,\r\nwe are informed on the best authority, the only flaw in FRERE’S title to\r\nthe sole authorship of the First Part. The Second and Third Parts were\r\nby CANNING.\r\n\r\n“By the kindness of [the late] LORD HATHERTON, we have now before us a\r\nbound volume containing all the numbers of _The Anti-Jacobin_ as they\r\noriginally appeared, eight pages quarto, with double columns, price\r\nsixpence. On the fly-leaf is inscribed: ‘This copy belonged to the\r\nMarquess Wellesley, and was purchased at the sale of his library after\r\nhis death, January, 1842. H.’ On the cover is pasted an engraved label\r\nof the arms and name of a former proprietor, CHARLES WILLIAM FLINT, with\r\nthe pencilled addition of ‘Confidential Amanuensis’. In this copy\r\nCANNING’S name is subscribed to (amongst others) the following pieces,\r\nwhich are also assigned to him (along with a large share in the most\r\npopular of the rest) by the most trustworthy rumours and\r\ntraditions:—_Inscription for the Door of the Cell in Newgate where Mrs.\r\nBrownrigg, the Prenticide, was confined previous to her execution; The\r\nFriend of Humanity and the Knife-Grinder_; the lines addressed _To the\r\nAuthor of the Epistle to the Editors of The Anti-Jacobin_; _The Progress\r\nof Man_ (all three parts); and _New Morality_.[1]\r\n\r\n“With the single exception of _The Friend of Humanity and the\r\nKnife-Grinder_, no piece in the collection is more freshly remembered\r\nthan the _Inscription for the Cell of Mrs. Brownrigg_, who\r\n\r\n               “‘Whipp’d two female ’prentices to death,\r\n               And hid them in the coal-hole’.\r\n\r\n“The Answer to _The Author of the Epistle to the Editors of The\r\nAnti-Jacobin_ is less known, and it derives a fresh interest from the\r\nfact, recently [_c._ 1854] made public, that _The Epistle_ (which\r\nappeared in _The Morning Chronicle_ of January 17, 1798) was the\r\ncomposition of WILLIAM LORD MELBOURNE. The beginning shows that the veil\r\nof incognito had been already penetrated.\r\n\r\n            “‘Whoe’er ye are, all hail!—whether the skill\r\n            Of youthful CANNING guides the ranc’rous quill;\r\n            With powers mechanic far above his age,\r\n            Adapts the paragraph and fills the page;\r\n            Measures the column, mends whate’er’s amiss,\r\n            Rejects THAT letter, and accepts of THIS;\r\n            Or HAMMOND, leaving his official toil,\r\n            O’er this great work consume the midnight oil—\r\n            Bills, passports, letters, for the Muses quit,\r\n            And change dull business for amusing wit.’\r\n\r\n“After referring to ‘the poetic sage, who sung of Gallia in a headlong\r\nrage,’ _The Epistle_ proceeds:—\r\n\r\n         “‘I swear by all the youths that MALMESBURY chose,[2]\r\n         By ELLIS’ sapient prominence of nose—\r\n         By MORPETH’S gait, important, proud and big—\r\n         _By Leveson Gower’s crop-imitating wig_,\r\n         That, could the pow’rs which in those numbers shine,\r\n         Could that warm spirit animate my line,\r\n         Your glorious deeds which humbly I rehearse—\r\n         Your deeds should live immortal as my verse;\r\n         And, while they wonder’d whence I caught my flame,\r\n         Your sons should blush to read their fathers’ shame’.\r\n\r\n“Happily the eminent and accomplished sons of these fathers will smile,\r\nrather than blush, at this allusion to their sires, and smile the more\r\nwhen they remember from which side the attack proceeded. It is clear\r\nfrom the Answer, that, whilst the band were not a little ruffled, they\r\nhad not the remotest suspicion that their assailant was a youth in his\r\nnineteenth year. Amongst other prefatory remarks they say:—\r\n\r\n“‘We assure the author of the epistle, that the answer which we have\r\nhere the honour to address to him, contains our genuine and undisguised\r\nsentiments upon the merits of the poem.\r\n\r\n“‘Our conjectures respecting the authors and abettors of this\r\nperformance may possibly be as vague and unfounded as theirs are with\r\nregard to the EDITORS of _The Anti-Jacobin_. We are sorry that we cannot\r\nsatisfy their curiosity upon this subject—but we have little anxiety for\r\nthe gratification of our own.\r\n\r\n“‘It is only necessary to add, what is most conscientiously the truth,\r\nthat this production, such as it is, is _by far the best_ of all the\r\nattacks that the combined wits of the cause have been able to muster\r\nagainst _The Anti-Jacobin_.’\r\n\r\n“The Answer opens thus:—\r\n\r\n           “‘BARD of the borrow’d lyre! to whom belong\r\n           The shreds and remnants of each hackney’d song;\r\n           Whose verse thy friends in vain for wit explore,\r\n           And count but _one good line_, in eighty-four!\r\n           Whoe’er thou art, all hail! Thy bitter smile\r\n           Gilds our dull page, and cheers our humble toil!’\r\n\r\n“The ‘one good line’ was ‘By Leveson Gower’s crop-imitating wig,’ but\r\nthe Epistle contains many equally good and some better. The speculations\r\nas to its authorship afforded no slight amusement to the writer and his\r\nfriends....\r\n\r\n“_New Morality_ is commonly regarded as the master-piece of _The\r\nAnti-Jacobin_; and, with the exception of a few lines, the whole of it\r\nis by CANNING. It appeared in the last number, and he is said to have\r\nconcentrated all his energies for a parting blow. The reader who comes\r\nfresh from DRYDEN or POPE, or even CHURCHILL, will be disappointed on\r\nfinding far less variety of images, sparkling antithesis, or condensed\r\nbrilliancy of expression. The author exhibits abundant humour and\r\neloquence, but comparatively little wit; _i.e._, if there be any truth\r\nin SYDNEY SMITH’S doctrine ‘that the feeling of wit is occasioned by\r\nthose relations of ideas which excite surprise, and surprise _alone_’.\r\nWe are commonly prepared for what is coming, and our admiration is\r\nexcited rather by the justness of the observations, the elevation of the\r\nthoughts, and the vigour of the style, than by a startling succession of\r\nflashes of fancy. If, as we believe, the same might be said of JUVENAL,\r\nand the best of his English imitators, JOHNSON, we leave ample scope for\r\npraise; and _New Morality_ contains passages which have been preserved\r\nto our time and bid fair to reach posterity. How often are the lines on\r\n_Candour_ quoted in entire ignorance or forgetfulness of their\r\nauthor....\r\n\r\n“The drama of _The Rovers_, or _Double Arrangement_, was written to\r\nridicule the German Drama, then hardly known in this country, except\r\nthrough the medium of bad translations of some of the least meritorious\r\nof SCHILLER’S, GOETHE’S, and KOTZEBUE’S productions. The parody is now\r\nprincipally remembered by Rogero’s song, of which, Mr. Edmonds states,\r\nthe first five stanzas were by CANNING. “Having been accidentally seen,\r\npreviously to its publication, by PITT, he was so amused with it that he\r\ntook a pen and composed the last stanza on the spot....”\r\n\r\n“CANNING’S reputed share in _The Rovers_ excited the unreasoning\r\nindignation, and provoked the exaggerated censure, of a man who has\r\nobtained a world-wide reputation by his historical researches, most\r\nespecially by his skill in separating the true from the fabulous, and in\r\nfilling up chasms in national annals by a process near akin to that by\r\nwhich CUVIER inferred the entire form and structure of an extinct\r\nspecies from a bone. The following passage is taken from NIEBUHR’S\r\n_History of the Period of the Revolution_ (published from his Lectures,\r\nin two volumes, in 1845):—\r\n\r\n“‘CANNING was at that time (1807) at the head of foreign affairs in\r\nEngland. History will not form the same judgment of him as that formed\r\nby contemporaries. He had great talents, but was not a great Statesman;\r\nhe was one of those persons who distinguish themselves as the squires of\r\npolitical heroes. He was highly accomplished in the two classical\r\nlanguages, but without being a learned scholar. He was especially\r\nconversant with Greek writers. He had likewise poetical talent, but only\r\nfor Satire. At first he had joined the leaders of opposition against\r\nPITT’S ministry: LORD GREY, who perceived his ambition, advised him,\r\nhalf in joke, to join the ministers, as he would make his fortune. He\r\ndid so, and was employed to write articles for the newspapers and\r\nsatirical verses, which were often directed against his former\r\nbenefactors.\r\n\r\n“‘Through the influence of the ministers he came into Parliament. So\r\nlong as the great eloquence of former times lasted, and the great men\r\nwere alive, his talent was admired; but older persons had no great\r\npleasure in his petulant, epigrammatic eloquence and his jokes, which\r\nwere often in bad taste. He joined the Society of the Anti-Jacobins,\r\nwhich defended everything connected with existing institutions. This\r\nsociety published a journal, in which the most honoured names of foreign\r\ncountries were attacked in the most scandalous manner. German literature\r\nwas at that time little known in England, and it was associated there\r\nwith the ideas of Jacobinism and revolution. CANNING then published in\r\n_The Anti-Jacobin_ the most shameful pasquinade which was ever written\r\nagainst Germany, under the title of _Matilda Pottingen_. Göttingen is\r\ndescribed in it as the sink of all infamy; professors and students as a\r\ngang of miscreants; licentiousness, incest, and atheism as the character\r\nof the German people. Such was CANNING’S beginning: he was at all events\r\nuseful, a sort of political Cossack’ (_Geschichte des Zeitalters der\r\nRevolution_, vol. ii., p. 242).\r\n\r\n“‘Here am I,’ exclaimed RALEIGH, after vainly trying to get at the\r\nrights of a squabble in the courtyard of the Tower, ‘employed in writing\r\na true history of the world, when I cannot ascertain the truth of what\r\nhappens under my own window.’ Here is the great restorer of Roman\r\nhistory—who, by the way, prided himself on his knowledge of\r\nEngland—hurried into the strangest misconception of contemporary events\r\nand personages, and giving vent to a series of depreciatory\r\nmisstatements, without pausing to verify the assumed groundwork of his\r\npatriotic wrath. His description of ‘the most shameful pasquinade,’ and\r\nhis ignorance of the very title, prove that he had never seen it. If he\r\nhad, he would also have known that the scene is laid at Weimar, not at\r\nGöttingen, and that the satire is almost exclusively directed against a\r\nportion of the dramatic literature of his country, which all rational\r\nadmirers must admit to be indefensible. The scene in _The Rovers_, in\r\nwhich the rival heroines, meeting for the first time at an inn, swear\r\neternal friendship and embrace, is positively a feeble reflection of a\r\nscene in GOETHE’S _Stella_; and no anachronism can exceed that in\r\nSCHILLER’S _Cabal und Liebe_, when Lady Milford, after declaring herself\r\nthe daughter of the Duke of Norfolk who rebelled against Queen\r\nElizabeth, is horrified on finding that the jewels sent her by the Grand\r\nDuke have been purchased by the sale of 7000 of his subjects to be\r\nemployed in the American war.[3]\r\n\r\n“Amongst the prose contributions to _The Anti-Jacobin_, there is one in\r\nwhich, independently of direct evidence, the peculiar humour of CANNING\r\nis discernible,—the pretended report of the meeting of the Friends of\r\nFreedom at the Crown and Anchor Tavern.[4] The plan was evidently\r\nsuggested by TICKELL’S _Anticipation_, in which the debate on the\r\nAddress at the opening of the Session was reported beforehand with such\r\nsurprising foresight, that some of the speakers, who were thus\r\nforestalled, declined to deliver their meditated orations.\r\n\r\n“At the meeting of the Friends of Freedom, ERSKINE, whose habitual\r\negotism could hardly be caricatured, is made to perorate as follows,\r\n&c.... A long speech is given to MACKINTOSH, who, under the name of\r\n_Macfungus_, after a fervid sketch of the Temple of Freedom which he\r\nproposes to construct on the ruins of ancient establishments, proceeds\r\nwith kindling animation, &c....[5]\r\n\r\n“The wit and fun of these imitations are undeniable, and their injustice\r\nis equally so. ERSKINE, with all his egotism, was, and remains, the\r\ngreatest of English advocates. He stemmed and turned the tide which\r\nthreatened to sweep away the most valued of our free institutions in\r\n1794; and (we say with LORD BROUGHAM) ‘Before such a precious service as\r\nthis, well may the lustre of statesmen and orators grow pale’.\r\nMACKINTOSH was pre-eminently distinguished by the comprehensiveness and\r\nmoderation of his views; nor could any man be less disposed by temper,\r\nhabits, or pursuits towards revolutionary courses. His lectures on _The\r\nLaw of Nature and Nations_ were especially directed against the new\r\nmorality in general, and GODWIN’S _Political Justice_ in particular.\r\n\r\n“At a long subsequent period (1807) CANNING, when attacked in Parliament\r\nfor his share in _The Anti-Jacobin_, declared that ‘he felt no shame for\r\nits character or principles, nor any other sorrow for the share he had\r\nhad in it than that which the imperfection of his pieces was calculated\r\nto inspire’. Still, it is one of the inevitable inconveniences of a\r\nconnection with the Press that the best known writers should be made\r\nanswerable for the errors of their associates; and the license of _The\r\nAnti-Jacobin_ gave serious and well-founded offence to many who shared\r\nits opinions and wished well to its professed object. In WILBERFORCE’S\r\n_Diary_ for May 18, 1799, we find ‘PITT, CANNING, and PEPPER ARDEN came\r\nin late to dinner. I attacked CANNING on indecency of _Anti-Jacobin_.’\r\nCOLERIDGE, in his _Biographia Literaria_, complains bitterly of the\r\ncalumnious accounts given by _The Anti-Jacobin_ of his early life, and\r\nasks with reason, ‘Is it surprising that many good men remained longer\r\nthan perhaps they otherwise would have done adverse to a party which\r\nencouraged and openly rewarded the authors of such atrocious calumnies?’\r\n\r\n“Mr. Edmonds says that PITT got frightened, and that the publication was\r\ndiscontinued at the suggestion of the Prime Minister. It is not unlikely\r\nthat CANNING, now a member of the House of Commons and Under-Secretary\r\nof State for Foreign Affairs, found his connection with it embarrassing,\r\nas his hopes rose and his political prospects expanded. Indeed, it may\r\nbe questioned whether a Parliamentary career can ever be united with\r\nthat of the daily or weekly journalist without compromising one or both.\r\nAt all events, the original _Anti-Jacobin_ closed with the number\r\ncontaining _New Morality_, and CANNING had nothing to do with the\r\n_monthly review_ started under the same name.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              THE _ANTI-JACOBIN_ AS AN AID TO GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n  [Considering _The Anti-Jacobin_ from a national as well as a\r\n  literary point of view, we cannot do better than use a portion of an\r\n  Essay on English Political Satires by the late JAS. HANNAY, in the\r\n  _Quarterly Review_, April, 1857.]\r\n\r\n\r\n“... In the case of _The Anti-Jacobin_, what are we to say? A hundred\r\nopinions may be adopted respecting the French Revolution. Some hate it\r\nwith unmitigated hatred. Some regret it, but accept its consequences as\r\nbeneficial to mankind on the whole. Some cherish its memory as a new\r\npolitical revelation of which they hope to see still further results.\r\nBut a candid man of any of these persuasions must remember that the aim\r\nof _The Anti-Jacobin_ was to keep _Britain_ from revolution during\r\n1797–8. It was therefore necessary to fight as our soldiers afterwards\r\ndid in Spain—to wage such a _literary_ war as suited the agitated spirit\r\nof Europe. While we blame CANNING, therefore, for speaking as he did of\r\nMADAME ROLAND, we must not forget the indecorum of her Memoirs, or that\r\nit was from persons of her party that vile aspersions were cast upon the\r\ncharacter of MARIE ANTOINETTE. There were men quite ready to begin the\r\nsame work over here that had been done in France, and that in a spirit\r\nof vulgar imitation, and under quite different circumstances. They had\r\nto be shot down like mad dogs; for a cur, though contemptible in\r\nordinary cases, becomes tragic when he has hydrophobia.\r\n\r\n“For _The Anti-Jacobin_ must be claimed an honour which can be claimed\r\nfor scarce one of the works we have passed under review. Let us waive\r\nthe question how much we may have owed it for helping to inspire that\r\nunity and stout insular self-confidence which carried us through the\r\ngreat war,—whole within and impervious without. Let us consider it only\r\nin a literary point of view, and we shall find it enjoying the rare\r\ndistinction that its best Satires live in real popular remembrance. The\r\n_Knife-Grinder_, with his\r\n\r\n          “‘_Story! God bless you, I have none to tell, sir_,’\r\n\r\nis almost as widely known as our nursery rhymes.\r\n\r\n“But if _The Anti-Jacobin_ excels all similar works in popularity, and\r\nin the eminence of its contributors, it also excels them in another\r\nimportant particular. It contains on the whole a greater number of\r\nreally good things than any one of them. The _Loves of the Triangles_,\r\nin which,\r\n\r\n              “‘Th’ obedient Pulley strong Mechanics ply,\r\n              And wanton Optics roll the melting eye!’\r\n\r\nis an irresistible parody, and likely to keep the original of Darwin\r\n[_Loves of the Plants_] in remembrance. Gray’s Odes have survived the\r\nburlesques of Colman; and the _Country and City Mouse_ of Prior and\r\nMontague is neglected by nine-tenths of those who read with admiration\r\nthe _Hind and the Panther_. But Darwin’s case is peculiar. Other poems\r\nlive in spite of ridicule; and his _Loves of the Plants_ in consequence\r\nof it. The Attic salt of his enemies has preserved his reputation.\r\n\r\n“There is always a purpose in _The Anti-Jacobin’s_ view something more\r\nimportant than the mere persiflage that teases individuals. Like the\r\nblade of Damascus, which has a verse of the Koran engraved on it, its\r\nfine wit glitters terribly in the cause of sacred tradition.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       DESCRIPTION OF THE PLATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n THE GIANT FACTOTUM AMUSING HIMSELF.

With his left foot he has crushed\r\n    the Opposition. On the same side is a document\r\n    labelled “Resources for supporting the War,” with a\r\n    collection of coin, evidently destined for foreign\r\n    subsidies. On his right side are various official\r\n    returns of volunteers, seamen, regulars, and\r\n    militia. He is thus prepared to carry on the war\r\n    abroad, and maintain tranquillity at home.\r\n\r\n THE FRIEND OF HUMANITY AND THE KNIFE-GRINDER.

CANNING, and it has been\r\n  prefixed only to the former edition of the _Poetry_ by the present\r\n  Editor, it is again considered an interesting addition to the\r\n  present one.]\r\n\r\nThe grounds upon which such pretensions have usually been rested by\r\nthose who have engaged in undertakings of this kind, are accuracy,\r\nvariety, and priority of Intelligence, connections at home,\r\ncorrespondence abroad, and, above all, a profession of impartial and\r\nunprejudiced attention to all opinions, and to all parties and\r\ndescriptions of men.\r\n\r\nOn none of these Topicks is it Our intention to enlarge.\r\n\r\nOf Our means of information, and of the use which We make of them, our\r\nreaders will, after a very short trial, be enabled to form their own\r\nopinion. And to that trial We confidently commit ourselves: professing,\r\nhowever, at the same time, that if the only advantage which We were\r\ndesirous of holding out to our Readers, were that of having it in our\r\npower to apprize them an hour or a day sooner than those Journals, which\r\nare already in their hands, of any event however important—We should\r\nbring to the undertaking much less anxiety for success, and should state\r\nour claims on public attention with much less boldness, than We are\r\ndisposed to do in the consciousness of higher purposes, and more\r\nbeneficial views.\r\n\r\nNovelty indeed We have to announce. For what so new in the present state\r\nof the daily and weekly PRESS (We speak generally, though there are\r\nundoubtedly exceptions which we may have occasion to point out\r\nhereafter) as THE TRUTH? To this object alone it is that Our labours are\r\ndedicated. It is the constant violation, the disguise, the perversion of\r\nthe Truth, whether in narrative or in argument, that will form the\r\nprincipal subject of our WEEKLY EXAMINATION: and it is by a diligent and\r\nfaithful discharge of this duty—by detecting falsehood, and rectifying\r\nerror, by correcting misrepresentation, and exposing and chastising\r\nmalignity—that We hope to deserve the reception which We solicit, and to\r\nobtain not only the approbation of the Country to our attempt, but its\r\nthanks for the motives which have given birth to it.\r\n\r\nThese are strong words. But We are conscious of intending in earnest\r\nwhat they profess. How far the execution of our purpose may correspond\r\nwith the design, it is for others to determine. It is ours to state that\r\ndesign fairly, and in the spirit in which we conceive it.\r\n\r\nOf the utility of such a purpose, if even tolerably executed, there can\r\nbe little doubt, among those persons (a very large part of the\r\ncommunity) who must have found themselves, during the course of the last\r\nfew years, perplexed by the multiplicity of contradictory accounts of\r\nalmost every material event that has occurred in that eventful and\r\ntremendous period; and who must anxiously have wished for some public\r\nchannel of information on which they could confidently rely for forming\r\ntheir opinion.\r\n\r\nBut before We can expect sufficient credit from persons of this\r\ndescription, to enable us to supply such a defect, and to assume an\r\noffice so important, it is natural that they should require some\r\nprofession of our principles as well as of our purposes; in order that\r\nthey may judge not only of our ability to communicate the information\r\nwhich We promise, but of our intention to inform them aright.\r\n\r\nTo that freedom from _partiality_ and _prejudice_, of which We have\r\nspoken above, by the profession of which so many of our Contemporaries\r\nrecommend themselves, We make little pretension—at least in the sense in\r\nwhich those terms appear now too often to be used.\r\n\r\nWe have not arrived (to our shame perhaps we avow it) at that wild and\r\nunshackled freedom of thought, which rejects all habit, all wisdom of\r\nformer times, all restraints of ancient usage, and of local attachment;\r\nand which judges upon each subject, whether of politicks or morals, as\r\nit arises, by lights entirely its own, without reference to recognized\r\nprinciple, or established practice.\r\n\r\nWe confess, whatever disgrace may attend such a confession, that We have\r\nnot so far gotten the better of the influence of long habits and early\r\neducation, not so far imbibed that spirit of liberal indifference, of\r\ndiffused and comprehensive philanthropy, which distinguishes the candid\r\ncharacter of the present age, but that We have our feelings, our\r\npreferences, and our affections, attaching on particular places,\r\nmanners, and institutions, and even on particular portions of the human\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought a narrow and illiberal distinction—but We avow\r\nourselves to be _partial_ to the COUNTRY _in which we live_,\r\nnotwithstanding the daily panegyricks which we read and hear on the\r\nsuperior virtues and endowments of its rival and hostile neighbours. We\r\nare _prejudiced_ in favour of _her_ Establishments, civil and religious;\r\nthough without claiming for either that ideal perfection, which modern\r\nphilosophy professes to discover in the other more luminous systems\r\nwhich are arising on all sides of us.\r\n\r\nThe safety and prosperity of _these kingdoms_, however unimportant they\r\nmay seem in abstract contemplation when compared with the more\r\nextensive, more beautiful, and more productive parts of the world, do\r\nyet excite in our minds a peculiar interest and anxiety; and will\r\nprobably continue to occupy a share of our attention by no means\r\njustified by the proportional consequence which speculative reasoners\r\nmay think proper to assign to them in the scale of the universe.\r\n\r\nWe should be averse to hazarding the smallest part of the practical\r\nhappiness of _this Country_; though the sacrifice should be recommended\r\nas necessary for accomplishing throughout the world an uniform and\r\nbeautiful system of theoretical liberty: and We should at all times\r\nexert our best endeavours for upholding its constitution, even with all\r\nthe human imperfections which may belong to it, though We were assured\r\nthat on its ruins might be erected the only pillar that is yet wanting\r\nto complete the “_most glorious fabrick which the Integrity and Wisdom\r\nof man have raised since the Creation_”.\r\n\r\nIf, as Philosopher MONGE[6] avers, in his eloquent and instructive\r\naddress to the Directory, “_The Government of England and the French\r\nRepublick cannot exist together_,” We do not hesitate in our choice;\r\nthough well aware that in that choice we may be much liable, in the\r\nopinion of many critics of the present day, to the imputation of a want\r\nof candour or of discernment.\r\n\r\nAdmirers of military heroism, and dazzled by military success in common\r\nwith other men, We are yet even _here_ conscious of some qualification\r\nand distinction in our feelings: We acknowledge ourselves apt to look\r\nwith more complacency on bravery and skill, when displayed in the\r\nservice of our Country, than when We see them directed against its\r\ninterests or its safety; and, however equal the claims to admiration in\r\neither case may be, We feel our hearts grow warmer at the recital of\r\nwhat has been atchieved by HOWE, by JERVIS, or by DUNCAN, than at the\r\n“_glorious victory of Jemappe_,” or “_the immortal battle of the bridge\r\nof Lodi_”.\r\n\r\nIn MORALS We are equally old-fashioned. We have not yet learned the\r\nmodern refinement of referring in all considerations upon human conduct,\r\nnot to any settled and preconceived principles of right and wrong, not\r\nto any general and fundamental rules which experience, and wisdom, and\r\njustice, and the common consent of mankind have established, but to the\r\ninternal admonitions of every man’s judgment or conscience in his own\r\nparticular instance.\r\n\r\nWe do not dissemble,—that We reverence LAW,—We acknowledge USAGE,—We\r\nlook even upon PRESCRIPTION without hatred or horror. And we do not\r\nthink these, or any of them, less safe guides for the moral actions of\r\nmen, than that new and liberal system of ETHICS, whose operation is not\r\nto bind but to loosen the bands of social order; whose doctrine is\r\nformed not on a system of reciprocal duties, but on the supposition of\r\nindividual, independent, and unconnected rights; which teaches that all\r\nmen are pretty equally honest, but that some have different notions of\r\nhonesty from others, and that the most received notions are for the\r\ngreater part the most faulty.\r\n\r\nWe do not subscribe to the opinion, that a sincere conviction of the\r\ntruth of no matter what principle, is a sufficient defence for no matter\r\nwhat action; and that the only business of moral enquiry with human\r\nconduct is to ascertain that in each case the principle and the action\r\nagree. We have not yet persuaded ourselves to think it a sound, or a\r\nsafe doctrine, that every man who can divest himself of a moral sense in\r\ntheory, has a right to be with impunity and without disguise a scoundrel\r\nin practice. It is not in our creed, that ATHEISM is as good a faith as\r\nCHRISTIANITY, provided it be professed with equal sincerity; nor could\r\nWe admit it as an excuse for MURDER, that the murderer was in his own\r\nmind conscientiously persuaded that the murdered might for many good\r\nreasons be better out of the way.\r\n\r\nOf all these and the like principles, in one word, of JACOBINISM in all\r\nits shapes, and in all its degrees, political and moral, public and\r\nprivate, whether as it openly threatens the subversion of States, or\r\ngradually saps the foundations of domestic happiness, We are the avowed,\r\ndetermined, and irreconcileable enemies. We have no desire to divest\r\nourselves of these inveterate prejudices; but shall remain stubborn and\r\nincorrigible in resisting every attempt which may be made either by\r\nargument or (what is more in the charitable spirit of modern reformers)\r\nby force, to convert us to a different opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt remains only to speak of the details of our PLAN.\r\n\r\nIt is our intention to publish Weekly, during the Session of Parliament,\r\na Paper, containing,\r\n\r\nFirst, An Abstract of the important events of the week, both at home and\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\nSecondly, Such Reflections as may naturally arise out of them: and,\r\n\r\nThirdly, A contradiction and confutation of the falsehoods and\r\nmisrepresentations concerning these events, their causes, and their\r\nconsequences, which may be found in the Papers devoted to the cause of\r\nSEDITION and IRRELIGION, to the pay or principles of FRANCE.\r\n\r\nThis last, as it is by far the most important, will in all probability\r\nbe the most copious of the three heads; and is that to which, above all\r\nothers, We wish to direct the attention of our Readers.\r\n\r\nWe propose diligently to collect, as far as the range of our own daily\r\nreading will enable us, and We promise willingly to receive, from\r\nwhatever quarter they may come, the several articles of this kind which\r\nrequire to be thus contradicted or confuted; which will naturally divide\r\nthemselves into different classes, according to their different degrees\r\nof stupidity or malignity.\r\n\r\nThere are, for instance (to begin with those of the highest order), the\r\nLIES of the Week; the downright, direct, unblushing falsehoods, which\r\nhave no colour or foundation whatever, and which must at the very moment\r\nof their being written, have been known to the writer to be wholly\r\ndestitute of truth.\r\n\r\nNext in rank come MISREPRESENTATIONS which, taking for their groundwork\r\nfacts in substance true, do so colour and distort them in description,\r\nas to take away all semblance of their real nature and character.\r\n\r\nLastly, The most venial, though by no means the least mischievous class,\r\nare MISTAKES; under which description are included all those Hints,\r\nConjectures, and Apprehensions, those Anticipations of Sorrow and\r\nDeprecations of Calamity, in which Writers who labour under too great an\r\nanxiety for the Public Welfare are apt to indulge; and which, when\r\nfalsified by the event, they are generally too much occupied to find\r\nleisure to retract or disavow:—A trouble which We shall have great\r\npleasure in taking off these Gentlemen’s hands.\r\n\r\nTo each of these several articles We shall carefully affix the name and\r\ndate of the Publication from which We may take the liberty of borrowing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith regard to the PROCEEDINGS IN PARLIAMENT, We shall not fail to mark\r\nto Our Readers the progress of the public business; though it does not\r\nenter into our Plan to give a regular detail of the Debates: nor would\r\nthe limits of our Paper allow of it.\r\n\r\nWe have a further reason for not occupying this province, which will\r\nequally account for our determination, not to receive Advertisements—our\r\nearnest desire not to lessen the circulation of any existing Public\r\nPrint.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious upon every ground of fairness and of policy, that We must\r\nentertain this desire very strongly with regard to the respectable\r\nPapers which are directed by principles and attachments like our own: an\r\nattachment (We have no wish to disguise it) to the cause of a\r\nGOVERNMENT, with whose support, whose popularity and consequent means of\r\nexertion, the circumstances of the present times have essentially\r\nconnected the existence of THIS COUNTRY as an independent Nation.\r\n\r\nAs little should we wish to circumscribe the sale of those JOURNALS,\r\nupon whose errors or perverseness, upon whose false statements and\r\npernicious doctrines We reckon for the main support, as they have been\r\nthe principal cause of our undertaking. These We would entreat to\r\nproceed with fresh vigour and increased activity. It is our wish to be\r\nseen together, and to be compared with them. Every week of\r\nmisrepresentation will be followed by its weekly comment; and with this\r\ncorrective faithfully administered, the longest course of MORNING\r\nCHRONICLES or MORNING POSTS, of STARS or COURIERS, may become not only\r\ninnocent but beneficial.\r\n\r\nWith these views then We commence our undertaking. Whatever may be the\r\nsuccess or the merit of its execution in our hands, the want of\r\nsomething like it has so long been felt and deplored by all thinking and\r\nhonest men, that We cannot doubt of the approbation and encouragement\r\nwith which the attempt will be received.\r\n\r\nWe claim the support, and We invite the assistance, of ALL, who think\r\nwith US that the circumstances and character of the age in which We live\r\nrequire every exertion of every man, who loves his COUNTRY in the old\r\nway, in which till of late years the LOVE of one’s COUNTRY was professed\r\nby most men, and by none disclaimed or reviled; of ALL who think that\r\nthe PRESS has been long enough employed principally as an engine of\r\ndestruction, and who wish to see the experiment fairly tried whether\r\nthat engine, by which many of the States which surround us have been\r\noverthrown, and others shaken to their foundations, may not be turned\r\ninto an instrument of defence for the one remaining COUNTRY which has\r\nESTABLISHMENTS to protect, and a GOVERNMENT with the spirit, and the\r\npower, and the wisdom to protect them; of ALL who look with respect to\r\npublic honour, and with attachment to the decencies of private life; of\r\nALL who have so little deference for the arrogant intolerance of\r\nJACOBINISM as still to contemplate the OFFICE and the PERSON of a KING\r\nwith veneration, and to speak reverently of RELIGION, without\r\napologizing for the singularity of their opinions; of ALL who think the\r\nblessings which we enjoy valuable, and who think them in danger; and\r\nwho, while they detest and despise the principles and the professors of\r\nthat NEW FAITH by which the foundations of all those blessings are\r\nthreatened to be undermined, lament the lukewarmness with which its\r\npropagation has hitherto been resisted, and are anxious, while there is\r\nyet time, to make every effort in the cause of their COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Published by J.

And it\r\nwould give us no small satisfaction to be able to report that we had\r\nsucceeded in this point precisely in the manner which would best have\r\nsuited our own taste and feelings, as well as those which we wish to\r\ncultivate in our readers.\r\n\r\nBut whether it be that good Morals, and what we should call good\r\nPolitics, are inconsistent with the spirit of true Poetry—whether “_the\r\nMuses still with freedom found_” have an aversion to _regular_\r\ngovernments, and require a frame and system of protection less\r\ncomplicated than king, lords, and commons:—\r\n\r\n           “Whether primordial _nonsense_ springs to life[7]\r\n           In the wild war of _democratic_ strife,”\r\n\r\nand there only—or for whatever other reason it may be, whether physical,\r\nor moral, or philosophical (which last is understood to mean something\r\nmore than the other two, though exactly _what_, it is difficult to say),\r\nwe have not been able to find one good and true Poet, of sound\r\nprinciples and sober practice, upon whom we could rely for furnishing us\r\nwith a handsome quantity of sufficient and approved verse—such verse as\r\nour readers might be expected to get by heart, and to sing; as the\r\nworthy philosopher MONGE describes the little children of Sparta and\r\nAthens singing the songs of Freedom, in expectation of the coming of\r\n_the Great Nation_.\r\n\r\nIn this difficulty we have had no choice but either to provide no poetry\r\nat all—a shabby expedient—or to go to the only market where it is to be\r\nhad good and ready made, that of the _Jacobins_—an expedient full of\r\ndanger, and not to be used but with the utmost caution and delicacy.\r\n\r\nTo this latter expedient, however, after mature deliberation, we have\r\ndetermined to have recourse; qualifying it at the same time with such\r\nprecautions as may conduce at once to the safety of our readers’\r\nprinciples, and to the improvement of our own poetry.\r\n\r\nFor this double purpose, we shall select from time to time from among\r\nthose effusions of the _Jacobin_ Muse which happen to fall in our way,\r\nsuch pieces as may serve to illustrate some one of the principles on\r\nwhich the poetical as well as the political doctrine of the NEW SCHOOL\r\nis established—prefacing each of them, for our readers’ sake, with a\r\nshort disquisition on the particular tenet intended to be enforced or\r\ninsinuated in the production before them—and accompanying it with an\r\nhumble effort of our own, in imitation of the poem itself, and in\r\nfurther illustration of its principle.\r\n\r\nBy these means, though we cannot hope to catch “_the wood-notes wild_”\r\nof the Bards of Freedom, we may yet acquire, by dint of repeating after\r\nthem, a more complete knowledge of the secret in which their greatness\r\nlies than we could by mere prosaic admiration; and if we cannot become\r\npoets ourselves, we at least shall have collected the elements of a\r\n_Jacobin_ Art of Poetry for the use of those whose genius may be more\r\ncapable of turning them to advantage.\r\n\r\nIt might not be unamusing to trace the springs and principles of this\r\nspecies of poetry, which are to be found, some in the exaggeration, and\r\nothers in the direct inversion of the sentiments and passions which have\r\nin all ages animated the breast of the favourite of the Muses, and\r\ndistinguished him from the “vulgar throng”.\r\n\r\nThe poet in all ages has despised riches and grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe _Jacobin_ poet improves this sentiment into a hatred of the rich and\r\nthe great.\r\n\r\nThe poet of other times has been an enthusiast in the love of his native\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nThe _Jacobin_ poet rejects all restriction in his feelings. _His_ love\r\nis enlarged and expanded so as to comprehend all human kind. The love of\r\nall human kind is without doubt a noble passion: it can hardly be\r\nnecessary to mention that its operation extends to _freemen_, and them\r\nonly, all over the world.\r\n\r\nThe old poet was a warrior, at least in imagination; and sung the\r\nactions of the heroes of his country in strains which “made Ambition\r\nVirtue,” and which overwhelmed the horrors of war in its glory.\r\n\r\nThe _Jacobin_ poet would have no objection to sing battles too—but _he_\r\nwould take a distinction. The prowess of Buonaparte, indeed, he might\r\nchant in his loftiest strain of exultation. _There_ we should find\r\nnothing but trophies and triumphs and branches of laurel and olive,\r\nphalanxes of Republicans shouting victory, satellites of despotism\r\nbiting the ground, and geniuses of Liberty planting standards on\r\nmountain-tops.\r\n\r\nBut let his own country triumph, or her allies obtain an advantage:\r\nstraightway the “beauteous face of war” is changed; the “pride, pomp,\r\nand circumstance” of victory are kept carefully out of sight, and we are\r\npresented with nothing but contusions and amputations, plundered\r\npeasants, and deserted looms. Our poet points the thunder of his blank\r\nverse at the head of the recruiting serjeant, or roars in dithyrambics\r\nagainst the lieutenants of pressgangs.\r\n\r\nBut it would be endless to chase the coy Muse of _Jacobinism_ through\r\nall her characters. _Mille habet ornatus._ The _Mille decenter habet_ is\r\nperhaps more questionable. For in whatever disguise she appears, whether\r\nof mirth or of melancholy, of piety or of tenderness; under all\r\ndisguises, like _Sir John Brute_ in woman’s clothes, she is betrayed by\r\nher drunken swagger and ruffian tone.\r\n\r\nIn the poem which we have selected for the edification of our readers\r\nand our own imitation this day, the principles which are meant to be\r\ninculcated speak so plainly for themselves, that they need no previous\r\nintroduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INSCRIPTION[8]\r\n_For the Apartment in Chepstow Castle, where Henry Marten, the Regicide,\r\n                     was imprisoned thirty years._\r\n\r\n          For thirty years secluded from mankind\r\n          Here MARTEN lingered. Often have these walls\r\n          Echoed his footsteps, as with even tread\r\n          He paced around his prison: not to him\r\n          Did Nature’s fair varieties exist;\r\n          He never saw the sun’s delightful beams,\r\n          Save when through yon high bars he pour’d a sad\r\n          And broken splendour.

But time shall come\r\n          When France shall reign, and laws be all repeal’d!\r\n\r\n  [HENRY MARTEN was one of the most interesting and remarkable of the\r\n  Regicides, not only from his abilities and consistent honesty, but\r\n  from the elegance of his manners, his wit, and the fascinating\r\n  gaiety of his conversation; and, moreover, from his humane\r\n  disposition and generosity to fallen foes. His private life,\r\n  however, was disgraced by the most reckless debauchery, which might\r\n  seem more appropriate in such libertines as Rochester and Sedley\r\n  than in a coadjutor of the strict Puritan party. But from a note in\r\n  Grey’s edition of _Hudibras_, pt. ii., ch. i., p. 313, it would\r\n  appear that the general opinion at that time was that profligacy of\r\n  a pronounced character was indulged in privately by more than a few\r\n  of that sanctimonious sect.\r\n\r\n  He was the son of Sir Henry Marten, LL.D., a loyal Judge of the\r\n  Admiralty. After receiving a learned education at Oxford, he entered\r\n  one of the Inns of Court, and travelled in France. Having a stake in\r\n  Berkshire—for he inherited a property of £3000 a year, besides\r\n  several thousand pounds in money—he was elected, 1640, one of the\r\n  members for the county in the last two Parliaments of King Charles\r\n  I. His chief seat was at Becket, in the parish of Shrivenham. He\r\n  afterwards obtained a grant of £1000 a year to him and his heirs out\r\n  of the forfeited estates of the Duke of Buckingham. His early\r\n  marriage with a rich widow, selected by his father, but not affected\r\n  by himself, also benefited his finances.\r\n\r\n  From the commencement of the Civil Wars he was a violent Republican;\r\n  and as early as 1643 openly expressed his opinion of the\r\n  desirability of the destruction of the King and his children, for\r\n  which rather premature advice he was expelled from the House of\r\n  Commons, and underwent a short imprisonment in the Tower. He was\r\n  appointed by the House of Commons a Colonel of Horse and Governor of\r\n  Reading, but made less mark as a soldier than as a rapacious spoiler\r\n  of the adherents of the King, which earned him the opprobrious\r\n  nickname of “Plunder-master General”.\r\n\r\n  Being empowered to dispose of the Regalia and royal trappings, he\r\n  once invested GEORGE WITHER—who had been made one of Cromwell’s\r\n  Major-Generals—with them, and so accoutred induced the old Poet to\r\n  strut up and down Westminster Abbey to the scandal of right-thinking\r\n  people.\r\n\r\n  To him also were referred the alterations in the public arms, the\r\n  Great Seal, and the legends upon the money. Upon the latter was a\r\n  shield bearing the cross of St. George, encircled by a palm and\r\n  olive branch, and inscribed _The Commonwealth of England_, and on\r\n  the reverse, _God with us, 1648_; which occasioned the remark “that\r\n  God and the Commonwealth were not on the same side”.\r\n\r\n  Nothing apparently could damp the ill-timed jocosity too often\r\n  prevalent in those troublous times, for at MARTEN’S trial, 16th\r\n  October, 1660, Ewer, who had been his servant, swore that “at the\r\n  signing of the warrant for the King’s execution he did see a pen in\r\n  Mr. CROMWELL’S hand, and he marked Mr. MARTEN in the face with it,\r\n  and Mr. MARTEN did the like to him”. But many of his excesses were\r\n  condoned in the eyes of both his friends and enemies by his generous\r\n  and humane spirit.\r\n\r\n  D’ISRAELI, in his _Commentaries on the life and Reign of Charles\r\n  I._, describes the ingenious way in which MARTEN saved the life of\r\n  DAVID JENKINS, a loyal and obstinate Welsh judge, who, when brought\r\n  to the bar of the House of Commons to answer for imprisoning several\r\n  persons for bearing arms against the King, peremptorily disowned\r\n  their jurisdiction, and defied them in the following bold terms:\r\n  “‘But, Mr. Speaker, since you and this House have renounced your\r\n  allegiance to your Sovereign, and are become a den of thieves,\r\n  should I bow myself in this House of Rimmon the Lord would not\r\n  pardon me’. The whole House were electrified.... He was voted guilty\r\n  of high treason without any trial. The day of execution was then\r\n  debated. HARRY MARTEN, who had not yet spoken, rose, not to dissent\r\n  from the vote of the House, he observed, but he had something to say\r\n  about the time of the execution. ‘Mr. Speaker,’ said he, ‘everyone\r\n  must believe that this old gentleman here is fully possessed in his\r\n  head resolved to die a martyr in his cause, for otherwise he would\r\n  never have provoked the House by such biting expressions. If you\r\n  execute him, you do precisely that which he hopes for, and his\r\n  execution will have a great influence over the people, since he is\r\n  condemned without a jury. I therefore move that we should suspend\r\n  the day of execution, and in meantime force him to live in spite of\r\n  his teeth.’ The drollery of the motion put the House into better\r\n  humour, and he was reprieved. After being kept in various prisons\r\n  for eleven years, he was released by Cromwell, and died in 1663,\r\n  aged eighty-one.”\r\n\r\n  Another instance may be given of MARTEN’S felicitous humour and\r\n  humane temper. When the Commons had rid themselves of the Sovereign,\r\n  _they voted the Lords to be dangerous and useless_. But MARTEN\r\n  proposed an amendment in their favour; namely, that _they were\r\n  useless, but not dangerous_.\r\n\r\n  His speeches in the House were represented to have been not long,\r\n  “but wondrous poynant, pertinent, and witty. He was exceedingly apt\r\n  in apt instances; he alone hath sometimes turned the whole House.”\r\n\r\n  He wrote several tracts on parliamentary subjects, and _Verses on\r\n  the Death of his Nephew, Charles Edmonds, 7th July, 1661, æt. 30_.\r\n  But the most amusing of the publications bearing his name is one\r\n  entitled _Familiar Letters to his Lady of Delight; also her kinde\r\n  Returnes: with his Rivall R. Pettingall’s Heroicall Epistles_.\r\n  Printed by Edmundus de Speciosâ Villâ [_i.e._, EDMUND GAYTON].\r\n  _Bellositi Dobunorum_ [Oxford], 1662 and 1663, 4to. Another edition,\r\n  with additions, appeared in 1685. “These epistles,” says D’ISRAELI,\r\n  “paint to the life the loose habits and _espiègleries_ of this witty\r\n  profligate; and I think they have been referred to by some\r\n  inconsiderate writers as a _genuine_ correspondence.” They were\r\n  probably altogether concocted by GAYTON. He was severely attacked in\r\n  various scurrilous lampoons, some of which are printed among the\r\n  _Rump Songs_, 1662.\r\n\r\n  On his trial he was found guilty and sentenced to death; but the\r\n  good feeling created among many who had in his prosperous days\r\n  enjoyed his society and hospitality, and even among many of his\r\n  former opponents by his generous treatment of them when in danger,\r\n  stood him in good stead, and it was by a well-timed and humorous\r\n  appeal to the Judges—such as he himself might have used—that his\r\n  life was saved. Henry, fourth Viscount FALKLAND, whose virtuous and\r\n  heroic father fell at the first Battle of Newbury while fighting for\r\n  the King, said to the Judges: “Gentlemen, ye talk here of making a\r\n  _sacrifice_: it was old law that all sacrifices were to be without\r\n  spot or blemish; and now you are going to make an old rotten rascal\r\n  a sacrifice”. This piece of wit pleased his Judges, and his sentence\r\n  was commuted to imprisonment for life. He was confined in Chepstow\r\n  Castle, Monmouthshire, for twenty years, and died in September,\r\n  1680, aged seventy-eight.\r\n\r\n  He must have felt some contrition for his vicious life, for some\r\n  time before his death he made this epitaph, by way of _acrostic_, on\r\n  himself:\r\n\r\n          H ere, or elsewhere (all’s one to you, to me),\r\n          E arth, air, or water gripes my ghostly dust,\r\n          N one knowing when brave fire shall set it free.\r\n          R eader, if you an oft tryed rule will trust,\r\n          Y ou’ll gladly do and suffer what you must.\r\n\r\n          M y life was worn with serving you and you,\r\n          A nd now death’s my pay, it seems, and welcome too.\r\n          R evenge destroying but itself, while I\r\n          T o birds of prey leave my old cage, and fly.\r\n          E xamples preach to the eye, care (then mine says)\r\n          N ot how you end, but how you spend your days.\r\n\r\n  “In Cromwell’s time CHEPSTOW CASTLE served as a place of\r\n  imprisonment for Jeremy Taylor; and, after the Restoration, it\r\n  received a less illustrious occupant in the person of HARRY MARTEN,\r\n  the Regicide, whose imprisonment here has attracted more than its\r\n  share of notice in consequence of the foolish lines written by\r\n  SOUTHEY in his days of republicanism and pantisocracy, but which are\r\n  as untrue in _fact_ as they are mischievous in _sentiment_. As to\r\n  the _fact_, it is notorious that MARTEN—at all events after the\r\n  first few years of his imprisonment—was little more than a prisoner\r\n  on parole; allowed to visit the neighbouring gentry, and occupying\r\n  at Chepstow Castle, with his family and servants, spacious and\r\n  comfortable apartments in the tower which still bears his name. As\r\n  to the _sentiment_, the lines received their best antidote in the\r\n  clever parody of Canning and Frere in _The Anti-Jacobin_.”—_Annals\r\n  of Chepstow Castle_, by J. F. Marsh, 1883; 4to.]\r\n\r\n  [Mrs. Elizabeth Brownrigg was executed at Tyburn on Monday, 14th\r\n  Sept., 1767, for murdering one of her apprentices, Mary\r\n  Clifford.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                No. II.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          Nov. 27, 1797.\r\n\r\nIn the specimen of JACOBIN POETRY which we gave in our last number was\r\ndeveloped a principle, perhaps one of the most universally recognised in\r\nthe Jacobin creed; namely, “that the animadversion of _human law_ upon\r\n_human actions_ is for the most part nothing but _gross oppression_; and\r\nthat, in all cases of the administration of _criminal justice_, the\r\ntruly benevolent mind will consider only the _severity of the\r\npunishment_, without any reference to the _malignity of the crime_”.\r\nThis principle has of late years been laboured with extraordinary\r\nindustry, and brought forward in a variety of shapes, for the\r\nedification of the public. It has been inculcated in bulky quartos, and\r\nillustrated in popular novels. It remained only to fit it with a\r\npoetical dress, which had been attempted in the INSCRIPTION for CHEPSTOW\r\nCASTLE, and which (we flatter ourselves) was accomplished in that for\r\nMRS. BROWNRIGG’S CELL.\r\n\r\nAnother principle, no less devoutly entertained, and no less sedulously\r\ndisseminated, is the _natural and eternal warfare of the_ POOR _and the_\r\nRICH. In those orders and gradations of society, which are the natural\r\nresult of the original difference of talents and of industry among\r\nmankind, the Jacobin sees nothing but a graduated scale of violence and\r\ncruelty. He considers every rich man as an oppressor, and every person\r\nin a lower situation as the victim of avarice, and the slave of\r\naristocratical insolence and contempt. These truths he declares loudly,\r\nnot to excite compassion, or to soften the consciousness of superiority\r\nin the higher, but for the purpose of aggravating discontent in the\r\ninferior orders.\r\n\r\nA human being, in the lowest state of penury and distress, is a treasure\r\nto the reasoner of this cast. He contemplates, he examines, he turns him\r\nin every possible light, with a view of extracting from the variety of\r\nhis wretchedness new topics of invective against the pride of property.\r\nHe, indeed (if he is a true Jacobin), refrains from _relieving_ the\r\nobject of his compassionate contemplation; as well knowing that every\r\ndiminution from the general mass of human misery must proportionably\r\ndiminish the force of his argument.\r\n\r\nThis principle is treated at large by many authors. It is versified in\r\nsonnets and elegies without end. We trace it particularly in a poem by\r\nthe same author [SOUTHEY] from whom we borrowed our former illustration\r\nof the Jacobin doctrine of crimes and punishments. In this poem, the\r\npathos of the matter is not a little relieved by the absurdity of the\r\nmetre. We shall not think it necessary to transcribe the whole of it, as\r\nour imitation does not pretend to be so literal as in the last instance,\r\nbut merely aspires to convey some idea of the manner and sentiment of\r\nthe original. One stanza, however, we must give, lest we should be\r\nsuspected of painting from fancy, and not from life.\r\n\r\nThe learned reader will perceive that the metre is SAPPHIC, and affords\r\na fine opportunity for his _scanning_ and _proving_, if he has not\r\nforgotten them.\r\n\r\n         Cōld wăs thē nīght wīnd; drĭftĭng fāst thĕ snōws fĕll;\r\n         Wīde wĕre thē dōwns, ānd shĕltĕrlēss ănd nākēd:\r\n         Whēn ă poōr wānd’rēr strŭgglĕd ōn hĕr joūrnĕy,\r\n                                     Wēāry ănd wāy-sōre.[9]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nThis is enough; unless the reader should wish to be informed how\r\n\r\n          Fāst o’ĕr thē blēāk hēāth răttlĭng drōve ă chārīōt;\r\n\r\nOr how, not long after,\r\n\r\n            Loūd blĕw thē wīnd, ūnhēārd wăs hēr cŏmplāinĭng—\r\n                              Ōn wĕnt thĕ hōrsemān.\r\n\r\nWe proceed to give our IMITATION, which is of the _Amœbæan_ or\r\n_Collocutory_ kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               SAPPHICS.\r\n             THE FRIEND OF HUMANITY AND THE KNIFE-GRINDER.\r\n\r\n                      FRIEND OF HUMANITY.[10]\r\n\r\n        “Needy Knife-grinder! whither are you going?\r\n        Rough is the road, your wheel is out of order—\r\n        Bleak blows the blast; your hat has got a hole in’t,\r\n                                  So have your breeches!\r\n\r\n        “Weary Knife-grinder! little think the proud ones,\r\n        Who in their coaches roll along the turnpike-\r\n        -road what hard work ’tis crying all day “Knives and\r\n                                  Scissars to grind O!”\r\n\r\n        “Tell me, Knife-grinder, how you came to grind knives?\r\n        Did some rich man tyrannically use you?\r\n        Was it the squire? or parson of the parish?\r\n                                  Or the attorney?\r\n\r\n        “Was it the squire, for killing of his game? or\r\n        Covetous parson, for his tithes distraining?\r\n        Or roguish lawyer, made you lose your little\r\n                                  All in a lawsuit?\r\n\r\n        “(Have you not read the Rights of Man, by Tom Paine?)\r\n        Drops of compassion tremble on my eyelids,\r\n        Ready to fall, as soon as you have told your\r\n                                  Pitiful story.”\r\n\r\n                          KNIFE-GRINDER.\r\n\r\n        “Story!

How the hopes and anticipations of\r\n  moderate reformers, as embodied in these lines, were falsified by\r\n  the spoliations and massacres which rapidly followed are but too\r\n  well known.\r\n\r\n  When, therefore, the _Anti-Jacobin_ was established to combat the\r\n  principles of the Revolution, these _Lines_ were, for party\r\n  purposes, maliciously referred to, and significantly recommended to\r\n  be “recited on the anniversary of the 14th August”. To make this\r\n  allusion more clear, it must be remembered that on the 10th August,\r\n  1792, after frightful massacres, the Hotel de Ville was seized and\r\n  the Tuileries stormed. On the 13th the king and family were\r\n  imprisoned in the Temple. His deposition, the dismissal of the\r\n  Ministers, and the formation of a National Convention, on more\r\n  popular principles than the Legislative Assembly, were decreed by\r\n  the victors. On the 14th Le Brun became Minister for Foreign\r\n  Affairs, Danton for Justice, and Monge for Marine; while the\r\n  Girondist Ministers, Roland, Servan, and Clavière, resumed their\r\n  former functions as Ministers of the Interior, War, and Finance\r\n  respectively.\r\n\r\n  The Song, _La Sainte Guillotine_, was evidently written as a\r\n  _Contrast_, and not as a _Parody_—a few lines at the beginning only\r\n  excepted, which serve as an introduction to verses on another\r\n  promised phase of the Revolution, the invasion of England.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LINES.\r\n\r\n Written for the purpose of being recited on the Anniversary of the 14th\r\n                    of August.

As it is marked by much ability, and has\r\n  been often quoted, it appears to the editor desirable to introduce\r\n  some portion of it into the present edition of the _Poetry_.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM.\r\n\r\n  The _House of Russell_ being given, LORD JOHN and LORD WILLIAM both\r\n  rose at once.\r\n\r\n  LORD JOHN made a very neat, and LORD WILLIAM a very appropriate\r\n  speech.\r\n\r\n  ALDERMAN COOMBE made a very impressive speech.\r\n\r\n  MR. TIERNEY made a very pointed speech.\r\n\r\n  MR. GREY made a very fine speech. He described the ministers as\r\n  “bold bad men”—their measures he repeatedly declared to be not only\r\n  “weak, but wicked”.\r\n\r\n  MR. BYNG said a few words.\r\n\r\n  GENERAL TARLETON and the _Electors of Liverpool_ being given, the\r\n  General, after an eulogium on Mr. Fox, begged to anticipate their\r\n  favourite concluding toast, and to give “_The Cause of Freedom all\r\n  over the World_”. This toast unfortunately gave rise to an\r\n  altercation which threatened to disturb the harmony of the evening.\r\n  Olaudah Equiano, the African, and Henry Yorke, the mulatto, insisted\r\n  upon being heard; but as it appeared that they were entering upon a\r\n  subject which would have entirely altered the complexion of the\r\n  Meeting, they were, though not without some difficulty, withheld\r\n  from proceeding further.\r\n\r\n  MR. ERSKINE rose, in consequence of some allusions which had been\r\n  made to Trial by Jury. He professed himself to be highly flattered\r\n  by the encomiums which had been lavished upon him; at the same time\r\n  he was conscious that he could not, without some degree of reserve,\r\n  consent to arrogate to himself those qualities which the partiality\r\n  of his friends had attributed to him. He had, on former occasions,\r\n  declared himself to be clothed with the infirmities of man’s nature;\r\n  and he now begged leave in all humility to reiterate that\r\n  confession; he should never cease to consider himself as a feeble,\r\n  and with respect to the extent of his faculties in many respects, a\r\n  finite being—he had ever borne in mind, and he hoped he should ever\r\n  continue to bear in mind, those words of the inspired Penman, “Thou\r\n  hast made him less than the angels, to crown him with glory and\r\n  honour”. These lines were indeed applicable to the state of man in\r\n  general, but of no man more than himself; they appeared to him\r\n  pointed and personal, and little less than prophetic; they were\r\n  always present to his mind; he could wish to wear them in his breast\r\n  as a sort of amulet against the enchantment of public applause, and\r\n  the witcheries of vanity and self-delusion; yet if he were indeed\r\n  possessed of those superhuman powers—all pretensions to which he\r\n  again begged leave most earnestly to disclaim—if he were endowed\r\n  with the eloquence of an angel, and with all those other faculties\r\n  which we attribute to angelic natures, it would be impossible for\r\n  him to do justice to the eloquence with which the Honourable\r\n  Gentleman who opened the meeting had defended the Cause of Freedom,\r\n  identified as he conceived it to be with the persons and government\r\n  of the DIRECTORY. In his present terrestrial state he could only\r\n  address it as a prayer to God and as counsel to Man that the words\r\n  which they had heard from that Honourable Gentleman might work\r\n  inwardly in their hearts, and in due time, produce the fruit of\r\n  Liberty and Revolution.\r\n\r\n  He had not the advantage of being personally acquainted with any of\r\n  the Gentlemen of the DIRECTORY; he understood, however, that one of\r\n  them (MR. MERLIN) previous to the last change, had stood in a\r\n  situation similar to his own—he was, in fact, nothing less than a\r\n  leading Advocate and Barrister in the midst of a free, powerful and\r\n  enlightened people.\r\n\r\n  The conduct of the DIRECTORY with regard to the exiled Deputies had\r\n  been objected to by some persons on the score of a pretended rigour.\r\n  For his part he should only say that having been, as he had been,\r\n  both a Soldier and a Sailor, if it had been his fortune to have\r\n  stood in either of those two relations to the DIRECTORY—as a Man and\r\n  as a Major-General he should not have scrupled to direct his\r\n  artillery against the National Representation:—as a Naval Officer he\r\n  would undoubtedly have undertaken for the removal of the Exiled\r\n  Deputies; admitting the exigency, under all its relations, as it\r\n  appeared to him to exist, and the then circumstances of the times,\r\n  with all their bearings and dependencies, branching out into an\r\n  infinity of collateral considerations, and involving in each a\r\n  variety of objects political, physical, and moral; and these again\r\n  under their distinct and separate heads, ramifying into endless\r\n  subdivisions which it was foreign to his purpose to consider.\r\n\r\n  Having thus disposed of this part of his subject, MR. ERSKINE passed\r\n  in a strain of rapid and brilliant allusions over a variety of\r\n  points characteristic of the conduct and disposition of the present\r\n  Ministry; Mr. Burke’s metaphor of “the Swinish Multitude,” Mr.\r\n  Reeves’ metaphor of the “Tree of Monarchy,” “the Battle of Tranent,”\r\n  “the March to Paris,” the phrase of “Acquitted Felons,” and the\r\n  exclamation of “Perish Commerce”—which last expression he declared\r\n  he should never cease to attribute to Mr. Windham; so long, at\r\n  least, as it should please the Sovereign Dispenser to continue to\r\n  him the power of utterance and the enjoyment of his present\r\n  faculties. He condemned the expedition to Quiberon, he regretted the\r\n  “Fate of Messrs. Muir and Palmer,” he exulted in the “Acquittal of\r\n  Citizens Tooke, Hardy, Thelwall, Holcroft and others,” and he\r\n  blessed that Providence to which (as it had been originally allotted\r\n  to him (Mr. Erskine) the talents which had been exerted in their\r\n  defence) the preservation of those Citizens might perhaps be\r\n  indirectly attributed. He then descanted on the captivity of La\r\n  Fayette, and the Dividend on the Imperial Loan.\r\n\r\n  After fully exhausting these subjects, MR. ERSKINE resumed a topic\r\n  on which he had only slightly glanced before. In a most delicate and\r\n  sportive vein of humour he contended, that if the people were a\r\n  Swinish Multitude, those who represented them must necessarily be a\r\n  Swinish Representation. It would be in vain to attempt to do justice\r\n  to the polite and easy pleasantry which pervaded this part of MR.\r\n  ERSKINE’S speech. Suffice it to say that the taste of the Audience\r\n  showed itself in complete unison with the genius of the Orator, and\r\n  the whole of this passage was crowned with loud and reiterated\r\n  plaudits. After a speech of unexampled exertion, MR. ERSKINE now\r\n  began to enter much at length into a recital of select passages from\r\n  our most approved English authors, concluding with a copious extract\r\n  from the several Publications of the late MR. BURKE; but such were\r\n  the variety and richness of his quotations which he continued to an\r\n  extent far exceeding the limits of this paper, that we found\r\n  ourselves under the necessity, either of considerably abridging our\r\n  original matter, or omitting them altogether, which latter\r\n  alternative we adopted the more readily as the greater part of these\r\n  brilliant citations have already passed through the ordeal of a\r\n  public and patriotic auditory; and as there is every probability\r\n  that the circumstances of the times will again call them forth on\r\n  some future emergency.\r\n\r\n  MR. ERSKINE concluded by recapitulating, in a strain of agonizing\r\n  and impressive eloquence, the several more prominent heads of his\r\n  speech:—He had been a Soldier and a Sailor, and had a son at\r\n  Winchester school—He had been called by Special Retainers, during\r\n  the summer, into many different and distant parts of the\r\n  country—travelling chiefly in Post-chaises—He felt himself called\r\n  upon to declare that his poor faculties were at the service of his\r\n  Country—of the free and enlightened part of it at least—He stood\r\n  here as a Man—He stood in the Eye, indeed in the Hand of GOD—to whom\r\n  (in the presence of the Company and Waiters) he solemnly appealed—He\r\n  was of Noble, perhaps, Royal Blood—He had a house at Hampstead—was\r\n  convinced of the necessity of a thorough and radical Reform—His\r\n  Pamphlet had gone through Thirty Editions—skipping alternately the\r\n  odd and even numbers—He loved the Constitution, to which he would\r\n  cling and grapple—And he was clothed with the infirmities of man’s\r\n  nature—He would apply to the present French Rulers (particularly\r\n  BARRAS and REUBEL) the words of the poet:—\r\n\r\n                 “Be to their Faults a little blind;\r\n                 “Be to their Virtues very kind,\r\n                 “Let all their ways be unconfin’d,\r\n                 “And clap the Padlock on their mind!”\r\n\r\n  And for these reasons, thanking the Gentlemen who had done him the\r\n  honour to drink his Health, he should propose “MERLIN, _the late\r\n  Minister of Justice, and Trial by Jury!_” MR. ERSKINE here concluded\r\n  a speech which had occupied the attention and excited the applause\r\n  of his Audience during a space of little less than three hours,\r\n  allowing for about three quarters of an hour, which were occupied by\r\n  successive fits of fainting, between the principal subdivisions of\r\n  his discourse.—MR. ERSKINE descended from the Table, and was\r\n  conveyed down stairs by the assistance of his friends. On arriving\r\n  at the corner of the Piazzas, they were surprized by a very\r\n  unexpected embarrassment. MR. ERSKINE’S horses had been taken from\r\n  the carriage, and a number of able Chairmen engaged to supply their\r\n  place; but these fellows having contrived to intoxicate themselves\r\n  with the money which the Coachman had advanced to them on account,\r\n  were become so restive and unruly, so exorbitant in their demands\r\n  (positively refusing to abide by their former engagement) that MR.\r\n  ERSKINE deemed it unsafe to trust himself in their hands, and\r\n  determined to wait the return of his own more tractable and less\r\n  chargeable animals. This unpleasant scene continued for above an\r\n  hour.\r\n\r\n  MR. SHERIDAN’S health was now drunk in his absence and received with\r\n  an appearance of general approbation;—when in the midst of the\r\n  applause MR. FOX arose, in apparent agitation, and directed the\r\n  attention of the Company to the rising, manly virtues of MR.\r\n  MACFUNGUS.\r\n\r\n  MR. MACFUNGUS declared that to pretend he was not elated by the\r\n  encomiums with which MR. FOX had honoured him was an affectation\r\n  which he disdained;—such encomiums would ever form the proudest\r\n  recompense of his patriotic labours—he confessed they were cheering\r\n  to him—he felt them warm at his heart—and while a single fibre of\r\n  his frame preserved its vibration, it would throb in unison to the\r\n  approbation of that Honourable Gentleman. The applause of the\r\n  Company was no less flattering to him—he felt his faculties\r\n  invigorated by it, and stimulated to the exertion of new energies in\r\n  the race of mind. Every other sensation was obliterated and absorbed\r\n  by it; for the present, however, he would endeavour to suppress his\r\n  feelings, and concentre his energies for the purpose of explaining\r\n  to the Company why he assisted now for the first time at the\r\n  celebration of the Fifth Revolution which had been effected in\r\n  regenerated France. The various and extraordinary talents of the\r\n  Right Hon. Gentleman—his vehement and overpowering perception, his\r\n  vigorous and splendid intuition would for ever attract the\r\n  admiration of all those who were in any degree endowed with those\r\n  faculties themselves or capable of estimating them in others; as\r\n  such, he had ever been among the most ardent admirers, and on many\r\n  occasions, among the most ardent supporters of the Right Hon.\r\n  Gentleman—he agreed with him in many points—in his general love of\r\n  Liberty and Revolution; in his execration of the War; in his\r\n  detestation of Ministers; but he entertained his doubts, and till\r\n  those doubts were cleared up, he could not, consistently with his\r\n  principles, attend at the celebration of any Revolution whatever.\r\n\r\n  These doubts, however, were now satisfactorily done away. A pledge\r\n  had been entered into for accomplishing an effectual radical\r\n  Revolution; not for the mere overthrow of the present System, nor\r\n  for the establishment of any other in its place; but for the\r\n  effecting such a series of Revolutions as might be sufficient for\r\n  the establishment of a Free System.\r\n\r\n  MR. MACFUNGUS continued he was incapable of compromising with first\r\n  principles, of acquiescing in short-sighted temporary palliative\r\n  expedients: if such had been his temper he should assuredly have\r\n  rested satisfied with the pledge which that Right Hon. Gentleman had\r\n  entered into about six months ago on the subject of Parliamentary\r\n  Reform, in which pledge he considered the promise of that previous\r\n  and preliminary Revolution, to which he had before alluded, as\r\n  essentially implicated.\r\n\r\n  “Whenever this Reform takes place,” exclaimed MR. MACFUNGUS, “the\r\n  present degraded and degrading system must fall into dissolution; it\r\n  must sink and perish with the corruptions which have supported it.\r\n  The national energies will awake, and shaking off their lethargy as\r\n  their fetters drop from them, they will follow the Angel of their\r\n  Revolution, while the Genius of Freedom soaring aloft beneath the\r\n  orb of Gallic Illumination will brush away as with the wing of an\r\n  Eagle all the cobwebs of Aristocracy. But before the Temple of\r\n  Freedom can be erected in their place, the surface which they have\r\n  occupied must be smoothed and levelled—it must be cleared by\r\n  repeated Revolutionary Explosions from all the lumber and rubbish\r\n  with which Aristocracy and Fanaticism will endeavour to encumber it,\r\n  and to impede the progress of the holy work.—The sacred level, the\r\n  symbol of Fraternal Equality, must be passed over the whole.—The\r\n  completion of the Edifice will indeed be the more tardy, but it will\r\n  not be the less durable for having been longer delayed—Cemented with\r\n  the blood of tyrants, and the tears of the Aristocracy, it will rise\r\n  a monument for the astonishment and veneration of future ages. The\r\n  remotest posterity, with our children yet unborn, and the most\r\n  distant portions of the Globe, will crowd around its Gates and\r\n  demand admission into its Sanctuary.—The Tree of Liberty will be\r\n  planted in the midst of it, and its branches will extend to the ends\r\n  of the Earth, while the Friends of Freedom meet and fraternize and\r\n  amalgamate under its consolatory shade. There our Infants shall be\r\n  taught to lisp in tender accents the Revolutionary Hymn—there with\r\n  wreaths of myrtle, and oak, and poplar, and vine and olive and\r\n  cypress and ivy; with violets and roses and daffodils and dandelions\r\n  in our hands we will swear respect to childhood and manhood and old\r\n  age, and virginity and womanhood and widowhood; but above all to the\r\n  Supreme Being.—There we will decree and sanction the Immortality of\r\n  the Soul.—There pillars and obelisks, and arches and pyramids, will\r\n  awaken the love of Glory and of our Country.—There Painters and\r\n  Statuaries, with their chisels and colours, and Engravers with their\r\n  engraving tools will perpetuate the interesting features of our\r\n  Revolutionary Heroes; while our Poets and Musicians, with an\r\n  honourable emulation, strive to immortalize their memory. Their\r\n  bones will be entombed in the Vault below, while their sacred Shades\r\n  continue hovering over our Heads—those venerated Manes which from\r\n  time to time will require to be appeased by the blood of the\r\n  remaining Aristocrats.—Then Peace and Freedom, and Fraternity and\r\n  Equality will pervade the whole Earth—while the Vows of\r\n  Republicanism, the Alter of Patriotism, and the Revolutionary\r\n  Pontiff, with the thrilling volcanic Sympathies, whether of Holy\r\n  Fury or of ardent Fraternal Civism, uniting and identifying, produce\r\n  as it were an electric Energy.”\r\n\r\n  MR. MACFUNGUS here paused for a few moments, seemingly overpowered\r\n  by the excess of Sensibility, and the force of the ideas which he\r\n  was labouring to convey.—The whole Company appeared to sympathize\r\n  with his unaffected emotions. After a short interval, he recovered\r\n  himself from a very impressive silence, and continued as follows:\r\n\r\n  “These prospects, Fellow-Citizens, may possibly be deferred. The\r\n  Machiavelism of Governments may for the time prevail, and this\r\n  unnatural and execrable contest may yet be prolonged; but the hour\r\n  is not far distant; Persecution will only serve to accelerate it,\r\n  and the blood of Patriotism streaming from the severing axe will\r\n  call down vengeance on our oppressors in a voice of Thunder. I\r\n  expect the contest, and I am prepared for it.—I hope I shall never\r\n  shrink nor swerve nor start aside wherever duty and inclination may\r\n  place me. My services, my life itself, are at your disposal—Whether\r\n  to act or to suffer, I am yours—With HAMPDEN in the field, or with\r\n  SIDNEY on the scaffold. My example may be more useful to you than my\r\n  talents: and this head may perhaps serve your cause more\r\n  effectually, if placed on a pole on Temple Bar, than if it was\r\n  occupied in organizing your Committees, in preparing your\r\n  Revolutionary Explosions, and conducting your Correspondence.”\r\n\r\n  MR. MACFUNGUS said he should give, as an unequivocal test of his\r\n  sentiments, “BUONAPARTE AND A RADICAL REFORM”.\r\n\r\n  The conclusion of MR. MACFUNGUS’S speech was followed by a\r\n  simultaneous burst of rapturous approbation from every part of the\r\n  room. The applause continued for several minutes, during which MR.\r\n  MACFUNGUS repeatedly rose to express his feelings.\r\n\r\n  The conversation now became more mixed and animated; several\r\n  excellent Songs were sung, and Toasts drank, while the progressive\r\n  and patriotic festivity of the evening was heightened by the vocal\r\n  powers of several of the most popular Singers. A new Song written by\r\n  Captain MORRIS received its sanction in the warmest expression of\r\n  applause. The whole company joined with enthusiasm in their old\r\n  favourite Chorus of Bow! Wow!! Wow!!!]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  [MACFUNGUS stands for SIR JAMES MACKINTOSH, who, after studying\r\n  medicine in Edinburgh, settled in London, and wrote for the\r\n  opposition newspapers, particularly the _Morning Post_, Daniel\r\n  Stuart, the proprietor, being his father-in-law. The first work that\r\n  brought him into notice was his _Vindiciæ Gallicæ_ (1791), in reply\r\n  to Burke’s _Reflections_ on the French Revolution, which splendid\r\n  philippic it greatly surpassed in philosophic thought, sound\r\n  feeling, and common sense. It was enthusiastically received by the\r\n  Liberal party, whose leaders eagerly sought his acquaintance and\r\n  co-operation; and when the _Association of the Friends of the\r\n  People_ was formed, he was appointed Secretary. His subsequent\r\n  successful career as an Advocate, Indian Judge, Member of\r\n  Parliament, Minister under Lord Grey, and as an English historian,\r\n  bore out the promise of his youth. He was born in 1765 and died in\r\n  1832.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 No. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          Dec. 11, 1797.\r\n\r\nWe have already hinted at the principle by which the followers of the\r\nJacobinical sect are restrained from the exercise of their own favourite\r\nvirtue of charity. The force of this prohibition, and the strictness\r\nwith which it is observed, are strongly exemplified in the following\r\npoem. It is the production of the same author [SOUTHEY] whose happy\r\neffort in English Sapphics we presumed to imitate; the present effusion\r\nis in Dactylics, and equally subject to the laws of Latin Prosody.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SOLDIER’S WIFE.\r\n\r\n             Wēāry̆ wăy-wāndĕrĕr, lānguĭd ănd sĭck ăt hĕart,\r\n             Trāvĕllĭng pāinfŭlly̆ ōvĕr thĕ rūggĕd roăd;\r\n             Wīld vĭsăg’d wāndĕrĕr—āh fŏr thy̆ hēavy̆ chănce.\r\n\r\nWe think that we see him fumbling in the pocket of his blue pantaloons;\r\nthat the splendid shilling is about to make its appearance, and to\r\nglitter in the eyes, and glad the heart of the poor sufferer. But no\r\nsuch thing—the bard very calmly contemplates her situation, which he\r\ndescribes in a pair of very pathetical stanzas; and after the following\r\nwell-imagined topic of consolation, concludes by leaving her to\r\nProvidence.\r\n\r\n       Thy husband will never return from the war again;\r\n       Cold is thy hopeless heart, _even as charity_;\r\n       Cold are thy famished babes—_God help thee_, widow’d one!\r\n\r\nWe conceived that it would be necessary to follow up this general rule\r\nwith the particular exception, and to point out one of those cases in\r\nwhich the embargo upon Jacobin bounty is sometimes suspended;[18] with\r\nthis view we have subjoined the poem of\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE SOLDIER’S FRIEND.\r\n                               DACTYLICS.\r\n\r\n        Come, little Drummer Boy, lay down your knapsack here:\r\n        I am the soldier’s friend—here are some books for you;\r\n        Nice clever books by TOM PAINE, the philanthropist.[19]\r\n        Here’s half-a-crown for you—here are some handbills too—\r\n        Go to the barracks, and give all the soldiers some.\r\n        Tell them the sailors are all in a mutiny.\r\n\r\n  _Exit Drummer Boy, with handbills and half-a-crown.—Manet Soldier’s Friend._\r\n\r\n            Liberty’s friends thus all learn to amalgamate,\r\n            Freedom’s volcanic explosion prepares itself,\r\n            Despots shall bow to the fasces of liberty.\r\n              Reason, philosophy, “fiddledum diddledum,”\r\n              Peace and fraternity, higgledy, piggledy,\r\n              Higgledy, piggledy, “fiddledum diddledum”.\r\n\r\n                                    _Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera._\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SONNET.—TO LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n            Just Guardian of man’s social bliss! for thee\r\n              The paths of danger gladly would I tread:\r\n              For thee! contented, join the glorious dead,\r\n            Who nobly scorn’d a life that was not free!\r\n\r\n            But worse than death it pains my soul to see\r\n              The Lord of Ruin, by wild Uproar led,\r\n              Hell’s first-born, ANARCHY, exalt his head,\r\n            And seize thy throne, and bid us bow the knee!\r\n\r\n            What though his iron sceptre, blood-imbrued,\r\n              Crush half the nations with resistless might;\r\n            Never shall this firm spirit be subdued:\r\n              In chains, in exile, still the chanted rite,\r\n            O LIBERTY! to thee shall be renew’d:\r\n              O still be sea-girt ALBION thy delight!

Even those who sympathise with the principles of the\r\nwriter selected as our model, seem to have been struck with the ridicule\r\nof his poetry.\r\n\r\nThere appeared in the _Morning Chronicle_ of Monday a _Sapphic Ode_,\r\napparently written by a friend and associate of our author, in which he\r\nis however travestied most unmercifully. And to make the joke the more\r\npointed, the learned and judicious editor contrived to print the ode _en\r\nmasse_, without any order of lines, or division of stanza; so that it\r\nwas not discovered to be _verse_ till the next day, when it was\r\nexplained in a hobbling _erratum_.\r\n\r\nWe hardly know which to consider as the greater object of compassion in\r\nthis case—the original _Odist_, thus parodied by his friend, or the\r\nmortified _Parodist_ thus mutilated by his printer. “_Et tu, Brute!_”\r\nhas probably been echoed from each of these worthies to his murderer, in\r\na tone that might melt the hardest heart to pity.\r\n\r\nWe cordially wish them joy of each other, and we resign the modern\r\n_Lesbian lyre_ into their hands without envy or repining.\r\n\r\nOur author’s DACTYLICS have produced a second imitation (conveyed to us\r\nfrom an unknown hand), with which we take our leave of this species of\r\npoetry also.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE SOLDIER’S WIFE.[20]\r\n\r\n                               DACTYLICS.\r\n\r\n                     “Wēāry̆ wăy-wāndĕrĕr,” &c. &c.\r\n\r\n                               IMITATION.\r\n\r\n                               DACTYLICS.\r\n\r\n  _Being the quintessence of all the Dactylics that ever were, or ever\r\n                           will be written._\r\n\r\n              HUMBLY ADDRESSED TO THE AUTHOR OF THE ABOVE.\r\n\r\n       Wearisome Sonnetteer, feeble and querulous,\r\n       Painfully dragging out thy demo-cratic lays—\r\n       Moon-stricken Sonnetteer, “ah! for thy heavy chance!”\r\n\r\n       Sorely thy Dactylics lag on uneven feet:\r\n       Slow is the syllable which thou wouldst urge to speed,\r\n       Lame and o’erburthen’d, and “screaming its wretchedness!”\r\n\r\n                       .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .[21]\r\n\r\n       Ne’er talk of ears again! look at thy spelling-book;\r\n       _Dilworth_ and _Dyche_[22] are both mad at thy quantities—\r\n       DACTYLICS, call’st thou ’em—“God help thee, silly one!”\r\n\r\n  [The following is the _Sapphic Ode_ alluded to above, which was\r\n  intended by the poet of the _Morning Chronicle_ as a “retort\r\n  courteous” to the _Friend of Humanity_. The printer of that paper,\r\n  unfortunately, being new to “such branches of learning,” and not\r\n  dreaming it could be intended for _poetry_, printed it as below.

We are sorry that we cannot satisfy their\r\ncuriosity upon this subject—but we have little anxiety for the\r\ngratification of our own.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly to be expected, that the character of the epistle should be\r\ntaken on trust from the editors of this volume; it is thought best,\r\ntherefore, to subjoin the whole performance as it originally appeared—a\r\nmode of hostility obviously the most fair, and in respect to the\r\ncombatants in the cause of Jacobinism, by much the most effectual. They\r\nare always best opposed by the arms which they themselves furnish.\r\nJacobinism shines by its own light.\r\n\r\nTo the respectable names which the author of the following address has\r\nthought proper to connect with the “ANTI-JACOBIN,” no apology is made\r\nfor thus preserving this otherwise perishable specimen of dulness and\r\ndefamation. He who has been reviled by the enemies of the\r\n“ANTI-JACOBIN,” must feel that principles are attributed to him, of\r\nwhich he need not be ashamed: and when the abuse is conveyed in such a\r\nstrain of feebleness and folly, he must see that those principles excite\r\nanimosity only in quarters of which he need not be afraid.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to add, what is most conscientiously the truth,\r\nthat this production, such as it is, is _by far the best_ of all the\r\nattacks that the combined wits of the cause have been able to muster\r\nagainst the “ANTI-JACOBIN”.\r\n\r\n\r\n            EPISTLE TO THE EDITORS OF THE ANTI-JACOBIN.[40]\r\n\r\n               _Hic Niger est; hunc tu, Romane, caveto!_\r\n\r\n To tell what gen’rals did, or statesmen spoke,\r\n To teach the world by truths, or please by joke;\r\n To make mankind grow bold as they peruse,\r\n Judge on existing things, and—weigh the news;\r\n For this a PAPER first display’d its page,\r\n Commanding tears and smiles through ev’ry age!\r\n\r\n   Hail, justly famous! who in modern days\r\n With nobler flight aspire to higher praise;\r\n Hail, justly famous! whose discerning eyes\r\n At once detect MISTAKES, MIS-STATEMENTS, LIES;[41]           10\r\n Hail, justly famous! who with fancy blest,\r\n Use fiend-like virulence for sportive jest;\r\n Who only bark to serve your private ends—\r\n Patrons of Prejudice, Corruption’s friends!\r\n Who hurl your venom’d darts at well-earned fame—\r\n Virtue your hate, and Calumny your aim!\r\n\r\n   Whoe’er ye are, all hail!—whether the skill\r\n Of youthful CANNING guides the ranc’rous quill;\r\n With powers mechanic far above his age,\r\n Adapts the paragraph and fills the page;                              20\r\n Measures the column, mends whate’er’s amiss,\r\n Rejects THAT letter, and accepts of THIS;\r\n Or HAMMOND,[42] leaving his official toil,\r\n O’er this great work consume the midnight oil—\r\n Bills, passports, letters, for the Muses quit,\r\n And change dull business for amusing wit:—\r\n His life of labour at one gasp is o’er,\r\n His books forgot—his desk beloved no more!\r\n Proceed to prop the Ministerial cause;\r\n See consequential MORPETH[43] nods applause;                 30\r\n In ev’ry fair one’s ears at balls and plays\r\n The gentle GRANVILLE LEVESON[44] whispers praise:\r\n Well-judging Patrons, whom such works can please;\r\n Great works, well worthy Patrons such as these!\r\n\r\n   Who heard, not raptured, the poetic Sage\r\n Who sung of Gallia in a headlong rage,\r\n And blandly drew with no uncourtly grace\r\n The simple manners of our English race—\r\n Extoll’d great DUNCAN, and, supremely brave,\r\n Whelm’d BUONAPARTE’S pride beneath the wave?

The following extracts from a\r\nletter from his Lordship to COL. M‘MAHON, dated June 15, 1797, will\r\nthrow some light on this negotiation. “They requested that I would\r\nendeavour, on the assurance of their support, to form an administration,\r\non the principle of excluding persons, who had on either side made\r\nthemselves obnoxious to the public. I strenuously recommended them to\r\nform an alliance with MR. FOX’S party, that might be satisfactory to\r\nthemselves, and reduce to strict engagement the extent of the measures,\r\nwhich MR. FOX, when brought into office by themselves, would propose.\r\nHitherto nobody has been designated to any particular office but SIR\r\nWILLIAM PULTENEY. The gentleman had said that he was the person whom\r\nthey should be most gratified in seeing CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, and\r\nI had professed to them and to him that there was not any person with\r\nwhom I could act more confidently. I added, the introduction of LORD\r\nTHURLOW, SIR W. PULTENEY, and myself, into the Cabinet, would not assure\r\nthe public of a change of system.”—ED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                No. XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          Jan. 29, 1798.\r\n\r\nThe following Ode[A] was dropped into the letterbox in our Publisher’s\r\nwindow. From its title—“A BIT OF AN ODE TO MR. FOX”—we were led to\r\nimagine there was some mistake in the business, and that it was meant to\r\nhave been conveyed to Mr. Wright’s neighbour, Mr. Debrett, whom we\r\nrecollected to have been the Publisher of the “Half of a Letter” to the\r\nsame gentleman, which occasioned so much noise (of horse-laughing) in\r\nthe world. Our politics certainly do not entitle us to the honourable\r\ndistinction of being made the channel for communicating such a\r\nproduction to the public. But, for our parts, as we are “not at war with\r\ngenius,” on whatever side we find it, we are happy to give this Poem the\r\nearliest place in our Paper; and shall be equally ready to pay the same\r\nattention to any future favours of the same kind, and from the same\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nThe Poem is a free translation, or rather, perhaps, imitation, of the\r\ntwentieth Ode of the second Book of HORACE.

It was, however, on\r\n  this occasion again authoritatively denied by LORD CAMPBELL, who\r\n  took occasion to observe that SIR ROBERT ADAIR was “now in his 90th\r\n  year, and for many years had served his country with great assiduity\r\n  and fidelity. He had been sent by successive ministers [Mr. Fox,\r\n  Lord Grey, _Mr. Canning_ (who assisted in libelling him so often in\r\n  the pages of the present work), Lord Wellesley, Lord Palmerston, the\r\n  Duke of Wellington] to Vienna, to Constantinople, to Brussels, and\r\n  to Berlin, and had represented the Crown of England upon some\r\n  occasions of very great importance, in which he had uniformly\r\n  acquitted himself to the satisfaction of the Government and for the\r\n  benefit of his country. He believed a more honourable man had not\r\n  lived in this country at any time.”\r\n\r\n  The following denial by Sir Robert Adair himself is copied from his\r\n  autograph statement, prefixed to the _Life of Wilberforce_,\r\n  published in 1838:—“This idle story is here accredited by Mr.\r\n  Wilberforce, and inserted by his sons, without due examination. It\r\n  was grounded on a journey I made to Vienna and St. Petersburg in\r\n  1791. Doctor Prettyman [_sic_], Bishop of Winchester, in a work\r\n  entitled _The Life of the Right Hon. William Pitt_, published by him\r\n  in 1823, brought forward the fact of my having gone upon this\r\n  journey as a criminal charge against Mr. Fox, who, as he pretends,\r\n  sent me upon it with the intent of counteracting some negociations\r\n  then carrying on between Great Britain and Russia at St. Petersburg.\r\n  I answered his accusation, I trust successfully, in two letters\r\n  published by Longman & Co. [_Two Letters from Mr. Adair to the Bp.\r\n  of Winchester, in answer to the charge of a High Treasonable\r\n  Misdemeanour brought by his Lordship against Mr. Fox and himself in\r\n  his Life of the Rt. Hon. W. Pitt_, 8vo., 1821], and explained the\r\n  circumstances which induced me in my travels in 1791 to visit the\r\n  two capitals above mentioned.—ROBERT ADAIR: 1838.”\r\n\r\n  The “Mission” was, however, firmly believed in, and PITT was urged,\r\n  but in vain, by the Duke of Richmond and others of the Government,\r\n  to arrest FOX for high treason.\r\n\r\n  The following extract from the _Political Memoranda of Francis,\r\n  fifth Duke of Leeds, now first printed from the Originals in the\r\n  British Museum; edited by Oscar Browning, for the Camden Society_,\r\n  1884, is an illustration of the rumours current at the time, and\r\n  many years after.\r\n\r\n  “Saty. 24 Novr. 1792. LORD ST. HELENS dined with me. After the\r\n  Ladies were gone upstairs we conversed, for some time on Foreign\r\n  affairs.... Speaking of the Russian business of last year he\r\n  reprobated in the strongest terms the conduct of FOX in sending an\r\n  agent, MR. ADAIR, to Petersburg to counteract the negociations of\r\n  this Court at that of Russia. He told me he knew for certain that\r\n  MR. ADAIR had shewn to some English merchants at Petersburg the\r\n  Empress’ Picture set in diamonds which had been given to him. That\r\n  it was not one of the sort usually given, but of much greater value,\r\n  being set round with large Brilliants, and the whole Picture covered\r\n  with a Table Diamond instead of Chrystal. That this was a present\r\n  seldom made but on some very particular occasion or to some great\r\n  favorite (I remember to have seen such a one in the possession of P.\r\n  Orlow). LD. ST. H. thought it must have been worth six or seven\r\n  thousand pounds, and of too much value probably to have been meant\r\n  for MR. ADAIR. The conclusion we both very naturally drew from this\r\n  circumstance was not very favorable to MR. FOX.”\r\n\r\n  The following additional particulars relating to the connection\r\n  between FOX and ADAIR may not be thought out of place here. They are\r\n  extracted from the highly interesting and important _Croker Papers,\r\n  being the Correspondence and Diaries, 1809–1830, of the Rt. Hon._ J.\r\n  W. CROKER, _M.P., Edited by Louis J. Jennings. M.P._, 3 vols., 8vo.,\r\n  1884.\r\n\r\n  The first is in these terms: “When ADAIR, whose father was a\r\n  surgeon, went as FOX’S Ambassador to Russia, LORD WHITWORTH, then\r\n  the King’s Minister, made a good joke, which tended not a little to\r\n  lower ADAIR, and defeat his object. ‘Est-ce un homme très\r\n  considérable, ce M. d’Adair?’ asked the EMPRESS. ‘Pas trop, Madame,’\r\n  replied Lord Whitworth, ‘quoique son père était grand seigneur\r\n  [saigneur].’” The other is taken from a very long statement on\r\n  various matters, made by K. George IV., when Prince of Wales, to\r\n  Croker personally. Adair’s wife, the Prince said, was a Frenchwoman\r\n  with whom ANDREOSSI, when here as Buonaparte’s Minister, intrigued.\r\n  THE DUCHESS OF DEVONSHIRE told him—the Prince of Wales—that Mrs.\r\n  Adair had offered her a bribe of £10,000 down, and as much more\r\n  whenever she might want it, if she would communicate the Cabinet\r\n  secrets, with which the French thought she could not fail to be\r\n  acquainted, through her intimacy with all the leaders of the\r\n  Government. This caused a breach between FOX and ADAIR. But the\r\n  former could only tell ADAIR that an obstacle—which he could neither\r\n  reveal nor overcome, but which did not affect or alter FOX’S\r\n  personal regard for him—prevented his appointment to be FOX’S\r\n  Under-Secretary of State.—_Croker Papers_, i. 293.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               No. XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           Feb. 5, 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n                ACME AND SEPTIMIUS; OR, THE HAPPY UNION\r\n               CELEBRATED AT THE CROWN AND ANCHOR TAVERN.\r\n\r\n           FOX,[98] with TOOKE to grace his side,\r\n           Thus address’d his blooming bride—\r\n           “Sweet! should I e’er, in power or place,\r\n           Another Citizen embrace;\r\n           Should e’er my eyes delight to look\r\n           On aught alive save JOHN HORNE TOOKE,\r\n           Doom me to ridicule and ruin,\r\n           In the coarse hug[99] of _Indian_ Bruin!”\r\n             He spoke;[100] and to the left and right,\r\n             NORFOLK hiccupp’d with delight.\r\n           TOOKE,[101] his bald head gently moving,\r\n             On the sweet patriot’s drunken eyes\r\n             His wine-empurpled lips applies,\r\n           And thus returns in accents loving:\r\n           “So, my dear[102] CHARLEY, may success\r\n           At length my ardent wishes bless,\r\n           And lead, through discord’s low’ring storm,\r\n           To one grand RADICAL REFORM!\r\n           As, from this hour I love thee more\r\n           Than e’er I hated thee before!”\r\n             He spoke, and to the left and right,\r\n             NORFOLK hiccupp’d with delight.\r\n           With this good omen they proceed;[103]\r\n           Fond toasts their mutual passion feed;\r\n           In FOX’S breast HORNE TOOKE prevails\r\n           Before[104] rich _Ireland_ and _South Wales_;[105]\r\n           And FOX (unread each other book),\r\n           Is Law and Gospel to HORNE TOOKE.\r\n             When were such kindred souls united?\r\n             Or wedded pair so much delighted?\r\n\r\n\r\n                  [ACME AND SEPTIMIUS.

A Caricature by GILLRAY on this\r\n  meeting was published on the 12th June, 1793.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          MR. FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.\r\n\r\n  The public, distracted with the various accounts of the celebration\r\n  of Mr. Fox’s Birth-day, naturally turn to us for an authentic detail\r\n  of that important event—from a recollection of the correct and\r\n  impartial statement we gave in a former Number, of what passed at a\r\n  MEETING OF THE FRIENDS OF FREEDOM [page 32].\r\n\r\n  To justify their confidence, we have had recourse to the _Morning\r\n  Post_ and _Morning Chronicle_ (the _Courier_ being too stupid for\r\n  our purpose), whose statements we have carefully read, and corrected\r\n  from the information of several gentlemen who were present. We are\r\n  thus enabled to lay before our readers a genuine narrative of the\r\n  whole proceeding, which we defy the tongue of Slander to controvert\r\n  in any material point.\r\n\r\n  As Mr. Fox’s reputation had been for some time on the decline, it\r\n  was thought necessary by the party (who are in great want of a\r\n  _Head_) to make as respectable an appearance as possible on the\r\n  present occasion. It was therefore suggested (at a previous meeting\r\n  of confidential friends) that if the unfortunate shyness which\r\n  subsisted between the _Whig Club_ and the _Corresponding Society_\r\n  could be opportunely removed by a few unimportant concessions on the\r\n  part of the former, such a number of citizens might be readily\r\n  procured from that respectable body as would serve to give the day\r\n  an _éclat_ it had not experienced since the fatal schism of 1792.\r\n\r\n  This hint, so reasonable in itself, was immediately adopted, and Sir\r\n  FRANCIS BURDETT, who was well acquainted with their haunts, was\r\n  ordered into the neighbourhood of Smithfield with a competent number\r\n  of tickets. He was on the point of setting out, when the Editor of\r\n  the _Morning Post_ observed, that _forgery_[106] was so common at\r\n  present, that he hardly thought it prudent to admit all who might\r\n  come with a bit of scribbled paper: on this it was determined to\r\n  distribute the price of admission amongst a certain number of people\r\n  to be selected by the Envoy:—these, it was rightly concluded, would\r\n  not fail to appear, from motives of vanity, as they could have no\r\n  other possible chance of dining with the Premier Dupe, we would say\r\n  Duke, in England. It now remained to determine the sum: this, after\r\n  a short discussion, was fixed at Eight Shillings and Sixpence per\r\n  head, “which,” said the Editor of the _Morning Post_, “will shew we\r\n  cannot he persons of mean rank, since we can afford, in hard times,\r\n  to give so much for a dinner”;[107] and Citizen BOSVILLE was desired\r\n  to advance the money upon the credit of the Whig Fund.\r\n\r\n  Previous to the meeting, the chairman dispatched a note to Sir\r\n  WILLIAM ADDINGTON, requesting that the Crown and Anchor might be\r\n  exempted from the visitation of his runners during the morning of\r\n  the 24th [Jan., 1798]. To this Sir WILLIAM assented, on condition\r\n  that it should be recommended to the gentlemen, to leave their\r\n  pocket-books and watches at home, that there might be as little\r\n  temptation as possible to break the peace. Thus everything was\r\n  arranged with a precaution that seemed to set accident at defiance.\r\n\r\n  Before four o’clock the passage to the LARGE ROOM was crammed, when,\r\n  on a hint that dinner was on the point of being served, one of the\r\n  head waiters advanced to the great door, and opened a wicket for the\r\n  admission of the company, as fast as they paid down their money. Two\r\n  or three had already passed in good order, when Mr. John Nicholls\r\n  advanced, and instead of 8s. 6d., produced to the astonished\r\n  receiver, _seventeen_ of his PRINTED SPEECHES, which, valuing them\r\n  at sixpence a-piece, he contended would make up the sum required.\r\n  These “_assets_” however, were absolutely rejected; and a violent\r\n  dispute was on the point of commencing, when Sir CHRISTOPHER HAWKINS\r\n  stept forward, and whispering a few words, which we did not hear,\r\n  obtained leave for his friend to pass. The Speeches were therefore\r\n  deposited, and Mr. NICHOLLS was already got within the wicket, when\r\n  the man suddenly pulled him back by the coat, and the dispute\r\n  recommenced with more violence than ever. Upon inquiry into the\r\n  cause of this new tumult, we found that a wag (whom we afterwards\r\n  discovered to be Mr. JEKYLL) had played the member for Tregony a\r\n  trick; having taken an opportunity, in the crowd, of extracting the\r\n  _genuine_ speeches from the pocket of the Honourable Member, and\r\n  replacing them by the same number of the _spurious_ ones, printed\r\n  for Mr. WRIGHT, the publisher of this Paper. These the waiter very\r\n  properly refused to receive, alleging, and indeed truly, that\r\n  instead of _six_ pence a-piece, the whole seventeen were not worth\r\n  _six_ farthings.\r\n\r\n  This altercation continued so long, that the company grew impatient;\r\n  and Mr. BRYAN EDWARDS, a little ashamed of his friend, who still\r\n  continued obstinate, offered to furnish his quota. Harmony now\r\n  seemed to be restored, when all at once a cry of astonishment broke\r\n  forth that beggars all description. On putting his hand into his\r\n  pocket for the price of admission, Mr. E. suddenly turned pale, and\r\n  exclaimed, “by G—, gentlemen, some of you have picked my pockets!” A\r\n  hundred voices instantly repeated the same cry, and a dreadful scene\r\n  of confusion and uproar took place.\r\n\r\n               Ardebant cuncta et fracta compage ruebant.\r\n\r\n  What the consequence would have been, it is impossible to say, had\r\n  not the waiter, with an air of authority, commanded the doors to be\r\n  shut at each end of the passage, and every man to exhibit the\r\n  contents of his pocket. A faint cry of No! No! was over-ruled; and\r\n  Sir FRANCIS BURDETT produced an old Red Cap from the bosom of his\r\n  shirt, which he put into the hands of the Duke of BEDFORD, who was\r\n  appointed collector-general _by acclamation_. With this his Grace\r\n  went, from man to man, executing his duty with the utmost fairness\r\n  and impartiality; and when he had finished, poured out the contents\r\n  of the cap before them all. These, it must be confessed, were a\r\n  little heterogeneous, consisting, besides a large sum of money, of a\r\n  brass knocker (this was immediately claimed by the landlord), a\r\n  pewter pot squeezed together, a pair of pattens, a pint decanter, a\r\n  duck ready trussed for dressing, a great quantity of potatoes, and a\r\n  vinegar cruet. What was most extraordinary was, that though, as his\r\n  Grace afterwards declared, the money was found in very unequal\r\n  portions, yet the total sum, which was £222, 5s. 6d., being divided\r\n  among the company, amounting to 523 persons, produced 8s. 6d. for\r\n  each individual, with the exception of the _Member_ for _Tregony_,\r\n  who brought nothing but his speech, and Capt. MORRIS, who pays for\r\n  everything with a Song.\r\n\r\n  Nothing material occurred during the Dinner, which was allowed to be\r\n  excellent of its kind, and where no such dish as Cow-heel (as\r\n  maliciously reported in _The True Briton_) made its appearance.\r\n\r\n  As soon as the cloth was removed, the Duke of NORFOLK took the Chair\r\n  amidst repeated plaudits,[108] and addressed the Company in these\r\n  words:\r\n\r\n  “Three virtuous Men, Citizens, have stood up in defence of\r\n  Liberty—MAXIMILIAN ROBESPIERRE, COLLOT D’HERBOIS, and CHARLES JAMES\r\n  FOX:—The first is guillotined; the second transported to _Cayenne_;\r\n  and the third”——Here all eyes were immediately upon Mr. FOX, who now\r\n  entered the room, supported by Citizens JOHN GALE JONES and JOHN\r\n  HORNE TOOKE—“As the Right Hon. Gentleman (resumed the Duke, a little\r\n  peevishly) has mistaken his cue, and appeared sooner than he ought,\r\n  I shall spare his modesty the panegyric I was preparing, and shortly\r\n  conclude with proposing the health of CHARLES JAMES FOX.”—This was\r\n  drank with three times three.\r\n\r\n  As soon as the clamour had subsided, Mr. FOX arose and said, “That\r\n  language, at least any which he could boast, was inadequate to the\r\n  exquisite feelings of gratitude which at once delighted and\r\n  oppressed him, at the sight of so numerous and so respectable a body\r\n  of free and independent Citizens, met for a purpose which would make\r\n  this the proudest and the happiest day of his life”. Having dwelt a\r\n  little on this idea, Mr. FOX observed, “that he would not interrupt\r\n  the conviviality of the day by a long Speech: he knew there were\r\n  several present who came to hear him make a long Speech, but he\r\n  would not make a long Speech—to what purpose should he do it?—what\r\n  could he add to the Speech lately delivered by him, and so\r\n  faithfully recorded in the ANTI-JACOBIN, a contemptible Publication,\r\n  but one to which the praise of Accuracy could not be denied. The new\r\n  and extraordinary circumstances of the times called for new and\r\n  extraordinary measures: he would, therefore, if they pleased,\r\n  compress what he had to say into a _Song_—(_loud applauses_)—One\r\n  word only.—He owed both the _burden_ and the _idea_ of this Song to\r\n  the _Morning Chronicle_. He had yesterday, the 23rd, found there A\r\n  BEGGING ADDRESS to the Nation, with DATE OBOLUM BELISARIO prefixed\r\n  to it as a Motto. This had pleased him much, and this morning at\r\n  breakfast he had endeavoured to adapt it, _mutatis mutandis_, to his\r\n  own circumstances: he should now have the honour of giving it.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SONG BY MR. FOX.\r\n\r\n                            _To the Tune of_\r\n            “Good People of England, and all who love Ale.”\r\n\r\n       Good People of England, of every degree,\r\n       Lords, Commoners, listen, O! listen to me;\r\n       Republicans, Royalists, all—mark my ditty—\r\n       You’ll find I’ve a number of claims on your pity—\r\n                                         Date Obolum Belisario.\r\n\r\n       Ye who heard me assert that Lord NORTH, now so mourn’d,\r\n       Was a _beast_ to be shunn’d, was a _fool_ to be scorn’d,\r\n       Yet who saw me, with real or fancied alarms,\r\n       Take the _fool_ to my councils, the _beast_ to my arms,\r\n                                         Date Obolum Belisario.\r\n\r\n       Ye who heard me declare the SUBSCRIBERS of REEVES\r\n       Were a scoundrel collection of cut-throats and thieves,\r\n       Yet who saw me immediately after repair,\r\n       And SUBSCRIBE at the Long-Room in Hanover Square,\r\n                                         Date Obolum Belisario.\r\n\r\n       Ye who heard—when Invasion was close at our door,\r\n       And _Parker_ and Liberty rul’d at the _Nore_—\r\n       Ye who heard—no; I mean, who DID NOT HEAR me speak,\r\n       While SHERIDAN,[109] damn him! affected to squeak,\r\n                                         Date Obolum Belisario.\r\n\r\n       Ye who heard me repeat that Resistance, at length,\r\n       Was reduc’d, by PITT’S Bill, to a question of _Strength_,\r\n       And that _prudence_ alone——\r\n\r\n  We know not how far Mr. FOX might have proceeded, had he not been\r\n  interrupted by a jangling of bells from the Side-table which\r\n  immediately drew all eyes that way. This proceeded from Capt.\r\n  MORRIS, who had fallen asleep during Mr. FOX’S Song, and was now\r\n  nodding on his chair, with a large paper Cap on his head, ornamented\r\n  with gilt tassels and bells, which one of the company had\r\n  dexterously whipped on unperceived. The first motion was that of\r\n  indignation; but the stupid stare of the unconscious Captain, who\r\n  half opened his eyes at every sound of the bells as his head rose or\r\n  fell, and immediately closed them again, _somno vinoque gravatus_,\r\n  had such a powerful effect on the risible faculties of the Company,\r\n  that they broke, as if by consent, into the most violent and\r\n  convulsive fits of laughter; Mr. FOX himself not being exempt from\r\n  the general contagion.\r\n\r\n  As soon as the Captain was made sensible of the cause of this\r\n  uproar, he attempted to pull off the Cap, but was prevented by a\r\n  Citizen from the _Corresponding Society_, who maintained that the\r\n  Company had a right to be amused by the Captain in what manner they\r\n  pleased; and that, as he seemed to amuse them more effectually in\r\n  _that state_ than in any other, he insisted, for one, on his\r\n  continuing to wear the Cap. This was universally agreed to, with the\r\n  exception of the Duke of NORFOLK. The Captain was therefore led to\r\n  the upper table, with all his “jangling honours loud upon him!”\r\n  Here, as soon as he was seated, his Noble Friend called upon him for\r\n  a Song.\r\n\r\n  The Captain sang the “PLENIPO” in his best manner.\r\n\r\n  This was received with great applause; and then the Duke gave “The\r\n  Defenders—of Ireland”—(_three times three_).\r\n\r\n  Captain MORRIS then began\r\n\r\n                     “And all the Books of Moses”;—\r\n\r\n  but was interrupted, before he had finished the first line, by Mr.\r\n  TIERNEY, who declared he would not sit there and hear anything like\r\n  ridicule on the Bible.[110]—(_Much coughing and scraping_.)—Mr.\r\n  Erskine took God to witness, that he thought the Captain meant no\r\n  harm;—and a gentleman from Cambridge, whose name we could not learn,\r\n  said, with great _naïveté_, that it was no more than was done every\r\n  day by his acquaintance. Mr. TIERNEY, however, persisted in his\r\n  opposition to the Song, and Captain MORRIS was obliged to substitute\r\n  “Jenny Sutton” in the place of it.\r\n\r\n  But the good humour of the company was already broken in upon, and\r\n  Mr. TIERNEY soon after left the room (to which he did not return)\r\n  with greater marks of displeasure in his face than we ever remember\r\n  to have seen there.\r\n\r\n  The Duke now gave RADICAL REFORM (_three times three, followed by\r\n  continued shouts of applause_).\r\n\r\n  A Counsellor JACKSON attempted to sing “Paddy Whack,” but was soon\r\n  silenced, on account of his stupid perversion of the words, and his\r\n  bad voice.\r\n\r\n  Citizen GALE JONES then rose and said—that he was no Orator, though\r\n  he got his living by oratory, being Chairman of a Debating Society.\r\n  He had also written a book—which he was told had some merit. He did\r\n  not rise to recommend it, but he thought it right to _hint_, that\r\n  those who wished for Constitutional information might be supplied\r\n  with it at the Bar; the price was trifling—Eighteen-pence was\r\n  nothing to the majority of the Company;—to himself, indeed—(here Mr.\r\n  HORNE TOOKE called out Order! Order! with some marks of\r\n  impatience)—He begged pardon, he would say no more—there was no one\r\n  whom he valued like Mr. TOOKE, there was no one indeed to whom he\r\n  was under such obligations; the very shoes he had on were charged by\r\n  Citizen HARDY to Mr. TOOKE’S account—Mr. TOOKE was also a great\r\n  friend to a Radical Reform—he loved a Radical Reform himself; the\r\n  Poor must always love Radical Reforms—he should therefore beg leave\r\n  to propose the health of Mr. JOHN HORNE TOOKE.—(_Three times\r\n  three._)\r\n\r\n  Mr. TOOKE rose, and spoke nearly as follows: “You all know,\r\n  Citizens, in what detestation I once held the Man whose Birth-day we\r\n  are now met to commemorate. You cannot yet have forgot the ‘TWO PAIR\r\n  OF PORTRAITS’ I formerly published, nor the glaring light in which I\r\n  hung up him and his father to the execration of an indignant\r\n  posterity. You must also be apprized of the charges of Corruption,\r\n  Insurrection, and Murder (_much hissing and applause, the latter\r\n  predominant_) which I brought against him, justly, as I must still\r\n  think, at a former Election for Westminster. How happens it then,\r\n  you will say, that I now come forward to do him honour? I will tell\r\n  you. At the last Election for Westminster, I had still my suspicions\r\n  of his sincerity; he appeared too anxious to preserve measures with\r\n  the spruce and powdered Aristocrats who usually attended him to the\r\n  Hustings; nor was it till the fourth or fifth day before the close\r\n  of the Poll, that those suspicions were removed. Aware that he was\r\n  losing ground among the People, he determined to make one great\r\n  effort to re-establish his popularity. He therefore came forward,\r\n  and addressed the free and independent Electors in front of the\r\n  Hustings, in a Speech, of which the remembrance yet warms my heart.\r\n  From that moment, I marked him as my own! Retractation was\r\n  impossible; and the panegyric he lately delivered on a Radical\r\n  Reform, in a House which I despise too much to name, was the natural\r\n  and inevitable consequence of that day’s declaration. You may\r\n  remember, that when I addressed my Friends, I only said, ‘Gentlemen,\r\n  Mr. FOX has spoken my sentiments; he has even gone beyond them—but I\r\n  thank him’.—What I then said I now repeat, with regard to his Speech\r\n  on a late occasion—‘I AM MOST PERFECTLY SATISFIED WITH HIS CONDUCT;\r\n  NOR DO I WISH TO ADVANCE ONE STEP IN THE CAUSE OF REFORM, BEYOND\r\n  WHAT MR. FOX HAS PLEDGED HIMSELF TO GO!!!’”[111]\r\n\r\n  Mr. TOOKE then begged leave to propose Mr. FOX’S health for the\r\n  second time, and sat down amidst a thunder of applause.[112]\r\n\r\n  The Duke of NORFOLK observed to the Company, that as they had drunk\r\n  the health of a Man dear to the People, he would now call upon them\r\n  to drink the health of their Sovereign[113]—here a hiccup\r\n  interrupted his Grace, and a most violent cry of “No Sovereign! no\r\n  Sovereign!” resounded through the room, and continued for several\r\n  minutes, notwithstanding the earnest entreaties of the Duke to be\r\n  heard. Order was, however, restored at length, when his Grace gently\r\n  chid the Company for taking advantage of a slight infirmity of\r\n  nature, to impute a design to him which was wholly foreign from his\r\n  heart—(_loud applause_). He augured well, however, of their\r\n  patriotism, and would now afford them an opportunity of repairing\r\n  the injury they had done him, by giving the Toast as he\r\n  intended—“THE HEALTH OF OUR SOVEREIGN—THE MAJESTY OF THE\r\n  PEOPLE”.[114]—(_Loud and incessant shouts of applause._)\r\n\r\n  A disgusting scene of uproar and confusion followed, which we shall\r\n  not attempt to detail. The Chairman sank under the table in a state\r\n  of stupefaction, and the rest of the Company, maddened alike with\r\n  noise and wine, committed a thousand outrages, till they were\r\n  literally turned into the streets by the Waiters. As many of them as\r\n  could speak were conducted home by the watchmen; others were\r\n  conveyed “in silent majesty” to the Round-house; and not a few of\r\n  them slept out the remainder of the night upon the steps of the\r\n  neighbouring houses. The Reporters of the Jacobin Papers were sought\r\n  out, and conveyed home by the pressmen, devils, &c., and one poor\r\n  youth, whom we afterwards found to be a Writer in the _Morning\r\n  Chronicle_ (hired for the day by _The True Briton_)[115] had his\r\n  pockets picked of a clean white Handkerchief and a Notebook, after\r\n  being severely beaten for deserting his former Employers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: '_The]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                No. XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          Feb. 12, 1798.\r\n\r\nIt has been our invariable custom to suppress such of our\r\ncorrespondents’ favours as conveyed any compliments to ourselves; and we\r\nhave deviated from it in the present instance, not so much out of\r\nrespect to the uncommon excellence of the Poem before us, as because it\r\nagrees so intimately with the general design of our paper—to expose the\r\ndeformity of the French Revolution, to counteract the detestable arts of\r\nthose who are seeking to introduce it here, and above all, to invigorate\r\nthe exertions of our countrymen against every Foe, foreign and domestic,\r\nby showing them the immense and inexhaustible resources they yet possess\r\nin British Courage and British Virtue!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   TO\r\n                    THE AUTHOR OF THE ANTI-JACOBIN.\r\n\r\n        FOE TO THY COUNTRY’S FOES!

W. Mason, in\r\n  which he declares how much he is “offended and disgusted by Mr.\r\n  Knight’s new, insolent, and self-conceited poem”. He winds up thus:\r\n  “I send you a parody on two lines of Mr. Knight, which will show you\r\n  that his poem is seen in its true light by a young man of allowed\r\n  parts, MR. CANNING, whom I never saw. The originals are the two\r\n  first lines at the top of page 5:”—\r\n\r\n          “Some fainter irritations seem to feel,\r\n          Which o’er its languid fibres gently steal”.—KNIGHT.\r\n\r\n   “Cools the crimp’d cod, to pond-perch pangs imparts,\r\n   Thrills the shelled shrimps, and opens oysters’ hearts.”—CANNING.\r\n\r\n  It is evident from this that Canning had thought of parodying the\r\n  poem immediately after its publication, and that Walpole had seen a\r\n  specimen in manuscript, nearly two years before its publication in\r\n  the _Anti-Jacobin_, in which the two lines (28, 29) are thus\r\n  altered:—\r\n\r\n        “Cools the crimpt cod, fierce pangs to perch imparts,\r\n        Shrinks shrivell’d shrimps, but opens oysters’ hearts”.\r\n\r\n  By an oversight, Peter Cunningham, in his edition of Walpole’s\r\n  Letters, attributes the latter’s attack to a previous production of\r\n  Knight’s, published in 1794, entitled _The Landscape: a didactic\r\n  Poem in three Books_, a work which had excited Walpole’s high\r\n  indignation by expressing opinions opposed to his own.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                No. XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        Feb. 26, 1798.\r\n\r\nThe specimen of the poem on the “Progress of Man,” with which we\r\nfavoured our Readers in our last Number, has occasioned a variety of\r\nletters, which we confess have not a little surprised us, from the\r\nunfounded, and even contradictory charges they contain. In one, we are\r\naccused of Malevolence, in bringing back to notice a work that had been\r\nquietly consigned to oblivion;—in another, of Plagiarism, in copying its\r\nmost beautiful passages;—in a third, of Vanity, in striving to imitate\r\nwhat was in itself inimitable, &c., &c. But why this alarm? has the\r\nauthor of the “_Progress of Civil Society_” an exclusive patent for\r\nfabricating _Didactic_ poems? or can we not write against Order and\r\nGovernment without incurring the guilt of Imitation? We trust we were\r\nnot so ignorant of the nature of a didactic poem (so called from\r\n_didaskein_, to teach, and _poema_, a poem; because it teaches nothing,\r\nand is not poetical) even before the _“Progress of Civil Society”_\r\nappeared, but that we were capable of such an undertaking.\r\n\r\nWe shall only say further, that we do not intend to proceed regularly\r\nwith our Poem; but having the remaining thirty-nine Cantos by us, shall\r\ncontent ourselves with giving, from time to time, such extracts as may\r\nhappen to suit our purpose.\r\n\r\nThe following passage, which, as the reader will see by turning to the\r\nContents prefixed to the head of the Poem, is part of the First Canto,\r\ncontains so happy a deduction of MAN’S present state of Depravity, from\r\nthe first slips and failings of his Original State, and inculcates so\r\nforcibly the mischievous consequences of _social_ or _civilized_, as\r\nopposed to _natural_ society, that no dread of imputed imitation can\r\nprevent us from giving it to our readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            PROGRESS OF MAN.\r\n\r\n Lo! the rude savage, free from civil strife,[139]\r\n Keeps the smooth tenour of his guiltless life;\r\n Restrain’d by none, save Nature’s lenient laws,\r\n Quaffs the clear stream, and feeds on hips and haws.\r\n Light to his daily sports behold him rise!                            65\r\n The bloodless banquet health and strength supplies.[140]\r\n Bloodless not long—one morn he haps to stray[141]\r\n Through the lone wood—and close beside the way\r\n Sees the gaunt tiger tear his trembling prey;\r\n Beneath whose gory fangs a leveret bleeds,                            70\r\n Or pig—such pig as fertile China breeds.[142]\r\n\r\n Struck with the sight, the wondering savage stands,\r\n Rolls his broad eyes, and clasps his lifted hands!\r\n Then restless roams—and loaths his wonted food;\r\n Shuns the salubrious stream, and thirsts for blood.                   75\r\n\r\n By thought matured, and quicken’d by desire,[143]\r\n New arts, new arms, his wayward wants require.\r\n From the tough yew a slender branch he tears,\r\n With self-taught skill the twisted grass[144] prepares;\r\n Th’ unfashioned bow, with labouring efforts bends                     80\r\n In circling form, and joins th’ unwilling ends.\r\n Next some tall reed he seeks—with sharp-edg’d stone\r\n Shapes the fell dart, and points with whiten’d bone.[145]\r\n\r\n   Then forth he fares. Around in careless play,\r\n Kids, pigs, and lambkins unsuspecting stray;                          85\r\n With grim delight he views the sportive band,\r\n Intent on blood, and lifts his murderous hand.\r\n Twangs the bent bow—resounds the fateful dart,\r\n Swift-wing’d, and trembles in a porker’s heart.\r\n\r\n   Ah, hapless porker! what can now avail[146] 90\r\n Thy back’s stiff bristles, or thy curly tail?\r\n Ah! what avail those eyes so small and round,\r\n Long pendent ears, and snout that loves the ground?[147]\r\n\r\n   Not unreveng’d thou diest!—in after times[148]\r\n From thy spilt blood shall spring unnumber’d crimes.                  95\r\n Soon shall the slaught’rous arms that wrought thy woe,\r\n Improved by malice, deal a deadlier blow;[149]\r\n When _social_ man shall pant for nobler game,\r\n And ’gainst his fellow man the vengeful weapon aim.\r\n\r\n   As love, as gold, as jealousy inspires,[150]                       100\r\n As wrathful hate, or wild ambition fires,\r\n Urged by the statesman’s craft, the tyrant’s rage,\r\n Embattled nations endless wars shall wage,\r\n Vast seas of blood the ravaged field shall stain,\r\n And millions perish—that a _king_ may reign!                  105\r\n\r\n   For blood once shed, new wants and wishes rise;[151]\r\n Each rising want invention quick supplies.\r\n To roast his victuals is man’s next desire,\r\n So two dry sticks he rubs, and lights a fire.\r\n Hail fire, &c. &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               No. XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                          March 5, 1798.\r\n\r\nWe are obliged to a learned correspondent for the following ingenious\r\nimitation of BION.—We will not shock the eyes of our fair readers with\r\nthe original Greek, but the following _Argument_ will give them some\r\nidea of the nature of the Poem here imitated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               ARGUMENT.\r\n\r\n  Venus is represented as bringing to the Poet, while sleeping, her son\r\n    Cupid, with a request that he would teach him Pastoral Poetry—Bion\r\n    complies, and endeavours to teach him the rise and progress of that\r\n    art:—Cupid laughs at his instructions, and in his turn teaches his\r\n    master the Loves of Men and Gods, the Wiles of his Mother,\r\n    &c.—“Pleased with his lessons,” says BION, “I forgot what I lately\r\n    taught Cupid and recollect in its stead only what Cupid taught me.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          IMITATION, &c.[152]\r\n\r\n                      WRITTEN AT ST.

J. FOX. For\r\n  this toast and other sentiments promulgated at the meeting, his\r\n  Grace a few days after received notice of his dismissal from the\r\n  Lord-Lieutenancy of the West Riding of Yorkshire and his Colonelcy\r\n  in the Militia, and on the 6th of February Earl Fitzwilliam was\r\n  gazetted to the former office, vice the Duke of Norfolk, _resigned_.\r\n  But sixteen years earlier, this _Toast_ was not considered\r\n  seditious; for in the _General Advertiser_ of the 13th of April,\r\n  1782, then edited by Perry (afterwards the eminent proprietor of the\r\n  _Morning Chronicle_), we find an account of a dinner of the electors\r\n  of Westminster held the preceding day at the Shakespeare Tavern,\r\n  _Earl Fitzwilliam_ in the chair. The first toast given by his\r\n  Lordship was, “THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE”. It was drunk by the Earl\r\n  of Effingham, the Earl of Surrey (afterwards Duke of Norfolk, and\r\n  the subject of the present remarks), Mr. Secretary Fox, Burke,\r\n  Windham, Dean Jebb, J. Churchill, Brand Hollis, Dr. Brocklesby, &c.\r\n  Thus the identical toast was proposed and drunk by the Earl of\r\n  Fitzwilliam, to whom the Lord-Lieutenancy now taken from the Duke of\r\n  Norfolk was given. It is not a little remarkable that Lord\r\n  Fitzwilliam himself was dismissed by his new Tory allies, Oct. 23,\r\n  1819, from the same Lord-Lieutenancy of the West Riding of\r\n  Yorkshire, having signed the requisition for the York meeting, at\r\n  which resolutions were passed condemning the measures of Ministers\r\n  (Lords Liverpool, Eldon, Bathurst, Castlereagh, Palmerston, &c.),\r\n  respecting the Manchester Reform Meeting, called by Henry Hunt, on\r\n  16th August, at which occurred what is known as the “Peterloo\r\n  Massacre”.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       [“THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE,” AS GIVEN ON FOX’S BIRTH-DAY.\r\n\r\n  The company was a very large one, but the estimated number of 2000\r\n  diners is surely an error. The Duke of Norfolk presided, supported\r\n  by the Duke of Bedford, the Earls of Lauderdale and Oxford,\r\n  Sheridan, Tierney, Erskine, Capt. Morris (who produced three new\r\n  songs for the occasion), and Horne Tooke; the latter became\r\n  reconciled to Fox by the explanation the latter gave of his\r\n  sentiments on parliamentary reform. On the cloth being removed, he\r\n  rose and said, “We are met in a moment of most serious difficulty to\r\n  celebrate the birth of a man dear to the friend of freedom. I shall\r\n  only recall to your memory that not twenty years ago, the\r\n  illustrious GEORGE WASHINGTON had not more than two thousand men to\r\n  rally round him when his country was attacked. America is now free.\r\n  This day full two thousand men are assembled in this place. I leave\r\n  the application to you. I propose to you the health of CHARLES JAMES\r\n  FOX.”\r\n\r\n  In the course of the evening the Duke’s health was drunk with great\r\n  enthusiasm. He returned thanks, and concluded his speech with these\r\n  words, “Give me leave to call on you to drink, Our Sovereign’s\r\n  health,\r\n\r\n                      “THE MAJESTY OF THE PEOPLE”.\r\n\r\n  After this toast had been drunk and warmly applauded, the Duke gave\r\n  successively, “The Rights of the People,” “Constitutional Redress of\r\n  the Wrongs of the People,” “A speedy and effectual Reform in the\r\n  Representation of the People in Parliament,” “The genuine Principles\r\n  of the British Constitution,” “The People of Ireland, and may they\r\n  be speedily restored to the Blessings of Law and Liberty”.\r\n\r\n  On the 6th of February, the next monthly meeting of the _Whig Club_\r\n  was held at the London Tavern, Ludgate Hill. The DUKE OF NORFOLK\r\n  presided. He gave as a toast, “The Man who dares be honest in the\r\n  worst of times—\r\n\r\n                          “CHARLES JAMES FOX”.\r\n\r\n  FOX returned thanks, and then toasted\r\n\r\n                    “THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE”.\r\n\r\n  He subsequently proposed the health of the Duke of Norfolk in a most\r\n  powerful speech. He adverted to the dismissal of the DUKE. “No\r\n  reason had been officially assigned; it was, however, generally\r\n  understood that it had arisen from the eulogium pronounced on\r\n  GENERAL WASHINGTON. Was it to be wondered at, that the noble Duke,\r\n  who had uniformly opposed the American war, should have done so?\r\n  What Englishman, what man of any country, whose heart was animated\r\n  with a love of freedom, did not venerate the name of that\r\n  illustrious patriot? It seems also “a toast” has given offence—the\r\n  Majesty of the People. I do not know upon what times we are fallen,\r\n  but the sovereignty of the people of Great Britain is surely a thing\r\n  not new to the language, to the feelings, nor the hearts of\r\n  Englishmen. It is the basis of the whole system of our Government.\r\n  It is an opinion, which if it be not true, King William was an\r\n  usurper. By what right did the glorious and immortal King William\r\n  the Third, whose portrait is placed on our chair, come to the throne\r\n  of these realms, if not by that of the sovereignty of the people?...\r\n  The King holds his title by an Act of Parliament. Who called that\r\n  Parliament? King William the Third. By what right did he obtain it?\r\n  By a Convention representing the sovereignty of the people. The\r\n  Convention of Representatives in fact did the thing. It is whimsical\r\n  enough to deprive the noble Duke of his appointments for an offence\r\n  which, if he had not committed during the reigns of George I. and\r\n  George II., would have subjected him to the charge of being a\r\n  Jacobite, and an adherent of the exiled family.... Of the persons of\r\n  his Majesty’s Ministers I will not say a word. There are several of\r\n  them to whom I may fairly say this sentiment is not new. One member\r\n  of the Cabinet (the Duke of Portland) is still a member of this\r\n  club; another (Mr. Windham) was a member; and a third (Earl Spencer)\r\n  long gloried in holding the same tenets. How often with the two\r\n  first have we drunk the sentiment in this room! What did they mean\r\n  when they drank the Sovereignty of the People? What, but that they\r\n  recognised by this approved and customary method a truth which\r\n  belongs to all people in reality, but is the avowed basis of the\r\n  Government of England, that the people of every country are its\r\n  legitimate Sovereign, and that all authority is delegated from and\r\n  for them? I should be ashamed, on account of my old respect for\r\n  those persons, if they did not honestly avow this to be their sense\r\n  of the sentiment.”\r\n\r\n  While adverting, on this occasion, to the dismissal of the DUKE OF\r\n  NORFOLK from his Lord-Lieutenancy and Colonelcy of Militia, FOX\r\n  remarked, “I have nothing the Ministers can take from me. I am still\r\n  indeed a Privy Councillor, at least I know nothing to the contrary;\r\n  and if this sentiment entitles the Noble Duke to this animadversion,\r\n  I shall certainly feel that I am equally entitled to this mark of\r\n  his Majesty’s displeasure.” This anticipation was verified shortly\r\n  afterwards.\r\n\r\n  On the 1st of May following, at the Freemasons’ Tavern, another\r\n  dinner of the _Whig Club_ took place. FOX was in the chair, and\r\n  gave, as the first toast—\r\n\r\n           “THE SOVEREIGNTY OF THE PEOPLE OF GREAT BRITAIN”.\r\n\r\n  The Duke of Norfolk proposed “The Health of the Man who dares be\r\n  Honest in the worst of Times—\r\n\r\n                          “CHARLES JAMES FOX”.\r\n\r\n  FOX responded in a most impressive speech. He said: “On any other\r\n  occasion, he should have contented himself with returning thanks,\r\n  but in the very peculiar embarrassments in which the country was now\r\n  plunged, he thought it necessary to say a few words in the only\r\n  place in which he thought it might be useful for him to deliver his\r\n  sentiments. The circumstances and events of public affairs of late\r\n  had induced him and many of his friends to abstain from their usual\r\n  assiduous attendance in Parliament. Their exertions for the\r\n  preservation of the Constitution had been of no avail; two years ago\r\n  they had seen the repeal of the Bill of Rights carried by a\r\n  triumphant majority; they had seen the functions of the\r\n  Constitutional Law suspended, on alarm created by the Ministers\r\n  themselves; and however well-founded the alarm might now be, he\r\n  scorned the idea that it was necessary for him to attend in his\r\n  place in the House of Commons, for the purpose only of vindicating\r\n  himself from the vulgar calumny that he was not an enemy to a\r\n  foreign invasion. It would be an insult on his whole life if such a\r\n  declaration could be expected from him. He believed there was not a\r\n  voice in the assembly he addressed which was not in unison with his\r\n  own—namely, that every man who heard him was both ready and willing\r\n  to stand forth in defence of his country, with the spirit that\r\n  belongs to Englishmen. He found no fault with those who thought it\r\n  necessary to make these professions elsewhere. Thus much only would\r\n  he say in this place for himself. _The present Government of the\r\n  country, he had no hesitation in saying, was a Government of\r\n  Tyranny. They had adopted the principles of Robespierre, and their\r\n  object was to establish tyranny in England._ Look at the situation\r\n  of the Sister Kingdom; our own will soon be the same. He had no\r\n  remedy to recommend but that the friends of freedom should be united\r\n  and firm, and wait for better times. Tyranny was now the order of\r\n  the day in every country in Europe. Notwithstanding the arbitrary\r\n  proceedings of our own Ministers, he was persuaded the unanimous\r\n  feeling of the country, the universal determination of every man in\r\n  it was to be ready to take the field against a foreign foe; and,\r\n  indeed, they had a powerful motive to do so, for if they were\r\n  united, they had a better chance to get rid of the tyranny of their\r\n  own Ministers than they could possibly have by the success of a\r\n  foreign invasion. Even in his present retirement he should be ready\r\n  to come forward, in every constitutional effort, to regain our lost\r\n  liberties; and he should be in the foremost of the ranks to repel\r\n  the invasion of a daring enemy.”\r\n\r\n  This speech led to a most important consequence—the erasing from the\r\n  Privy Council Book the name of one of the most illustrious statesmen\r\n  which had ever adorned it. FOX’S name was struck out by the King on\r\n  the 9th of May.\r\n\r\n  On the 6th of June, after the dinner at the _Whig Club_, the DUKE OF\r\n  BEDFORD proposed “THE HEALTH OF CHARLES FOX,” and remarked in severe\r\n  terms on Ministers having caused the King to strike his name out of\r\n  the list of the Privy Council. FOX said: “It would be most unfit for\r\n  him to say a word respecting the Noble Duke’s allusion to a\r\n  circumstance personal to himself. Would to God the time of the\r\n  Ministers had been always employed in such _frivolous fooleries_ as\r\n  settling who should be _Honourable_ and who _Right Honourable_, and\r\n  deliberating on the titles most befitting their friends and\r\n  supporters.” FOX, with some of his supporters, seceded from\r\n  Parliament in 1797, and returned to the House of Commons in 1802 to\r\n  defend the Peace of Amiens, and he was persuaded to continue his\r\n  parliamentary attendance by the urgent request of friends, with\r\n  whose wishes he felt himself bound to comply.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                No. XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                       March 19, 1798.\r\n\r\nFor the authenticity of the enclosed Ballad we refer our readers to a\r\nvolume of MS.

 Our lives and safeties all:\r\n              A woeful story late there did\r\n                In Britain’s Isle befall.\r\n\r\n              DUKE SMITHSON, of NORTHUMBERLAND,\r\n                A vow to God did make,\r\n              The choicest gifts in fair England,\r\n                For him and his to take.\r\n\r\n              “Stand fast, my merry men,” he cried,\r\n                “By MOIRA’S Earl and me,\r\n              And we will gain place, wealth and pow’r,\r\n                As arm’d neutrality.\r\n\r\n              “Excise and Customs, Church and Law,\r\n

           “Sith ’twill no better be;\r\n              I trust we have within our realm\r\n                Five hundred good as he.”\r\n\r\n              The DUKE then join’d with Charley FOX,\r\n                A leader ware and tried,\r\n              And ERSKINE, SHERIDAN, and GREY\r\n                Fought stoutly by his side.\r\n\r\n              Throughout the English Parliament,\r\n                They dealt full many a wound;\r\n              But in his king’s and country’s cause,\r\n                PITT firmly stood his ground.\r\n\r\n              And soon a law like arrow keen,\r\n                Or spear, or curtal-axe,\r\n              Struck poor DUKE SMITHSON to the heart,\r\n                In shape of _Powder-tax_.[172]\r\n\r\n              Sore leaning on his crutch, he cried,\r\n                “Crop, crop, my merry men all;\r\n              No guinea for your head I’ll pay,\r\n                Though Church and State should fall.”\r\n\r\n              Again the

SMITHSON, and behold\r\n                The assessment thou must pay;\r\n              Dogs, horses, houses, coaches, clocks,\r\n                And servants in array.”\r\n\r\n              “Nay,” quoth the DUKE, “in thy black scroll\r\n                Deductions I espye—\r\n              For those who, poor, and mean, and low,\r\n                With children burthen’d lie.\r\n\r\n

your transient pleasures prove!\r\n        Just as we think the sweet delights our own,\r\n        We strive to fix them, and we find them flown:—\r\n        For fix’d by laws, and limited by rules,\r\n        Affection stagnates and love’s fervour cools;\r\n        Shrinks like the gather’d flower, which, when possess’d,\r\n        Droops in the hand, or withers on the breast:\r\n        Feels all its native bloom and fragrance fly,\r\n        And death’s pale shadows close its purple dye.\r\n          While mutual wishes form love’s only vows,\r\n        By mutual interests nursed, the union grows;\r\n        Respectful fear its rising power maintains,\r\n        And both preserve, when each may break, its chains.\r\n          But when in bands indissoluble join’d,\r\n        Securely torpid sleeps the sated mind;\r\n        No anxious hopes or fears arise, to move\r\n        The flagging wings, or stir the fires of love:\r\n        Benumb’d, the soul’s best energies repose,\r\n        And life in dull unvaried torpor flows;\r\n        Or only shakes off lethargy to teaze\r\n        Whom once its only pleasure was to please.—ED.]\r\n\r\n  In illustration of these peculiar doctrines of Love and Marriage,\r\n  the authors of the present Parody introduced into the first twenty\r\n  lines of the preceding “Extract,” the very free statements on these\r\n  subjects which appear in Chapters 8, 12, 14, 16, 17, of the\r\n  narrative of Cook’s First Voyage to the Pacific in the “Endeavour,”\r\n  in 1768, derived, by the editor, Dr. John Hawkesworth, from the\r\n  Diary of Mr. (afterwards Sir Joseph) Banks, who accompanied Captain\r\n  Cook.—ED.]\r\n\r\n  [LORD ERSKINE, after dinner, inveighed bitterly against Marriage;\r\n  and smarting, I suppose, under the recollection of his own\r\n  unsuccessful choice, concluded by saying that a wife was _a tin\r\n  canister tied to a man’s tail_, which very much excited the\r\n  indignation of Lady Ann Culling Smith, who was of the party. “Monk”\r\n  Lewis took a sheet of paper, and wrote the following neat epigram on\r\n  the subject, which he presented to Her Royal Highness [the Duchess\r\n  of York]:—\r\n\r\n  “Lord Erskine at marriage presuming to rail,\r\n  Says, _a wife’s a tin canister tied to ones tail_;\r\n  And the fair Lady Ann, while the subject he carries on,\r\n  Feels hurt at his Lordship’s degrading comparison.\r\n  But wherefore degrading? if taken aright,\r\n  A tin canister’s useful, and polished, and bright,\r\n  And if dirt its original purity hide,\r\n  ’Tis the fault of the puppy to whom it is tied.”\r\n                                  —_Journal of T.

W. Mason, dated 22nd March, 1796, in which he declares how much\r\n  he is offended and disgusted by Knight’s “_new_ insolent and\r\n  self-conceited poem,” alluding to his _Progress of Civil\r\n  Society_,—the former one being “_The Landscape_, a didactic poem in\r\n  three books,” 4to, pub. 1794, of which mention has already been\r\n  made.\r\n\r\n  In 1816 he was examined before a Select Committee of the House of\r\n  Commons on the proposed purchase by the Government of the Elgin\r\n  Marbles; but his estimate of their value as works of the highest art\r\n  was much below that of other artistic witnesses, such as Flaxman,\r\n  Westmacott, Chantrey, B. West, and others. For these statements he\r\n  was severely criticised in vol. 14 of the _Quarterly Review_, and in\r\n  a squib, reprinted in the _New Whig Guide_ in 1819. He valued the\r\n  collection at £25,000; Gavin Hamilton’s estimate was £60,800, and\r\n  Lord Aberdeen’s £35,000; for which latter sum they were obtained by\r\n  the Government. He bequeathed his collection of ancient Bronzes,\r\n  Greek Coins, &c.—valued at £50,000—to the British Museum.\r\n\r\n  He represented Ludlow till 1806. He was a supporter of FOX, upon\r\n  whom he wrote a Monody. He was never married, and he was succeeded\r\n  in his fine property, including Downton Castle, near Ludlow, &c., on\r\n  his death in 1824, by his brother, Thomas Andrew Knight, one of the\r\n  most scientific of horticulturists, and he in turn was succeeded by\r\n  his grandson, Andrew Johnes Rouse Boughton, second son of the late\r\n  Sir W. E. Rouse Boughton, Bart., who added by royal license in 1856\r\n  the name of Knight to his patronymic.—ED.]\r\n\r\n  [The drama (here nicknamed _The Reformed Housekeeper_), but entitled\r\n  by the author “_Misanthropy and Repentance_,” was produced at Drury\r\n  Lane Theatre, Sheridan being then lessee, as “_The Stranger_,” on\r\n  the 24th March, 1798. The following was the cast:—_The Stranger_, J.\r\n  P. Kemble; _Baron Steinfort_, John Palmer; _Francis_, R. Palmer;\r\n  _Peter_, Suett; _Tobias_, J. Aikin; _Solomon_, Wewitzer; _Count\r\n  Wintersen_, Barrymore; _Mrs. Haller_, Mrs. Siddons; _Countess\r\n  Wintersen_, Mrs. Goodall; _Charlotte_, Miss Stuart. It was\r\n  considered by competent authorities as one of Kemble’s finest\r\n  efforts, and was performed on twenty-six successive nights. Some of\r\n  our most eminent actors and actresses have essayed the principal\r\n  parts. Miss O’Neill made her last appearance on the stage in the\r\n  character of Mrs. Haller, 13th of July, 1818.\r\n\r\n  The acting version purported to be altered from the German by Benj.\r\n  Thompson (afterwards Count Rumford), but it is likely that all or\r\n  most of the alterations came from the skilful hands of Sheridan,\r\n  assisted by Kemble. The pathetic song introduced, “_I have a silent\r\n  sorrow here_,” was written by the former. Two other versions of the\r\n  drama appeared in the year 1798—one by A. Schinck, and the other by\r\n  G. Papendick—but neither has been acted.\r\n\r\n  Kotzebue tells us in his _Autobiography_ that this play of his was\r\n  acted at the Imperial Palace of _The Hermitage_, St. Petersburg,\r\n  under his superintendence while manager of the Imperial Company of\r\n  German Comedians, and excited visible emotion in the Emperor Paul.\r\n  He himself saw it acted at Tobolsk during his exile in Siberia. The\r\n  vast and splendid palace of _The Hermitage_ is now given up to the\r\n  Arts. It contains the enormous collection of Pictures accumulated by\r\n  the Russian sovereigns (including the Houghton Gallery formed by Sir\r\n  Robert Walpole), together with a Gallery of Sculpture, one of the\r\n  finest assortments of Antique Gems in the world, a museum of Grecian\r\n  and Etruscan Antiquities, and a library of rare Books and\r\n  Manuscripts.\r\n\r\n  An awful event took place during the performance of this play a\r\n  short time after its production. John Palmer, an eminent comedian,\r\n  while acting the principal character, at Liverpool, on the 2nd of\r\n  August, 1798, expired on the stage. He had recently suffered severe\r\n  domestic bereavements, which are supposed to have given a painful\r\n  application to some passages in the third act in which he had to\r\n  utter the words: “There is another and a better world”. In the first\r\n  scene of the fourth act, his agitation increased; he fell into the\r\n  arms of the performer of the part of Baron Steinfort, and died\r\n  without a groan. A narrative of this shocking event, published\r\n  immediately afterwards, by the same performer, disposes of the\r\n  generally-received but more emotional tradition that Palmer’s\r\n  earthly career was terminated while pronouncing the above words. He\r\n  was in his fifty-seventh year.\r\n\r\n  This is not the only instance of so impressive an end, for a similar\r\n  death-stroke overtook Joseph Peterson, an excellent actor, in\r\n  October, 1758, while representing _The Duke_ in _Measure for\r\n  Measure_. In act 3, sc. 1, in reciting the words—\r\n\r\n          “—Reason thus with life:\r\n          If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing\r\n          That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art—”\r\n\r\n  he dropped into the arms of Moody, who personated _Claudio_, and\r\n  never spoke more!—ED.]\r\n\r\n  [“One other noted character we visited—the one who, according to\r\n  William Taylor of Norwich, was the greatest of all. This was AUGUST\r\n  VON KOTZEBUE, the very popular dramatist, whose singular fate it was\r\n  to live at variance with the great poets of his country, while he\r\n  was the idol of the mob. He was at one time (about this time (1801)\r\n  and a little later) a favourite in all Europe. One of his plays,\r\n  _The Stranger_, I have seen acted in German, English, Spanish,\r\n  French, and, I believe, also Italian. He was the pensioner of\r\n  Prussia, Austria, and Russia. The odium produced by this\r\n  circumstance, and the imputation of being a spy, are assigned as the\r\n  cause of his assassination by [C. L. Sand] a student of Jena, a few\r\n  years after our visit [March 3, 1819]. He was living, like Goethe,\r\n  in a large house and in style. I drank tea with him, and found him a\r\n  lively little man, with small black eyes.

To this\r\nMr. H. takes occasion to reply—[195]\r\n\r\n“What you call the _new principles_ are, in fact, nothing less than\r\n_new_. They are the principles of primeval nature, the system of\r\noriginal and unadulterated man.\r\n\r\n“If you mean by my addiction to _new principles_ that the object which I\r\nhave in view in my larger work [meaning the ‘Progress of Man’] and in\r\nthe several other _concomitant_ and _subsidiary_ didactic poems which\r\nare necessary to complete my plan, is to restore this first, and pure\r\nsimplicity; to rescue and to recover the interesting nakedness of human\r\nnature, by ridding her of the cumbrous establishments which the folly,\r\nand pride, and self-interest of the worst part of our species have\r\nheaped upon her;—you are right. Such is my object. I do not disavow it.\r\nNor is it mine alone. There are abundance of abler hands at work upon\r\nit. _Encyclopedias_, _Treatises_, _Novels_, _Magazines_, _Reviews_, and\r\n_New Annual Registers_, have, as you are well aware, done their part\r\nwith activity and with effect. It remained to bring the _heavy_\r\nartillery of a didactic poem to bear upon the same object.\r\n\r\n“If I have selected your paper as the channel for conveying my labours\r\nto the public, it was not because I was unaware of the hostility of your\r\nprinciples to mine, of the bigotry of your attachment to ‘things as they\r\nare,’ but because, I will fairly own, I found some sort of cover and\r\ndisguise necessary for securing the favourable reception of my\r\nsentiments; the usual pretexts of humanity, and philanthropy, and fine\r\nfeeling, by which we have for some time obtained a passport to the\r\nhearts and understandings of men, being now worn out or exploded. I\r\ncould not choose but smile at my success in the first instance, in\r\ninducing _you_ to adopt my poem as your own.\r\n\r\n“But you have called for an explanation of these principles of ours, and\r\nyou have a right to obtain it. Our first principle is, then—the reverse\r\nof the trite and dull maxim of Pope—‘_Whatever is, is right_’. We\r\ncontend, that ‘_Whatever is, is wrong_’; that institutions, civil and\r\nreligious, that social order (as it is called in _your_ cant) and\r\nregular government, and law, and I know not what other fantastic\r\ninventions, are but so many cramps and fetters on the free agency of\r\nman’s _natural intellect_ and _moral sensibility_; so many badges of his\r\ndegradation from the primal purity and excellence of his nature.\r\n\r\n“Our second principle is, the ‘_eternal and absolute perfectibility of\r\nman_’. We contend, that if, as is demonstrable, we have risen from a\r\nlevel with the _cabbages of the field_ to our present comparatively\r\nintelligent and dignified state of existence, by the mere exertion of\r\nour own _energies_; we should, if these _energies_ were not repressed\r\nand subdued by the operation of prejudice, and folly, by KING-CRAFT and\r\nPRIEST-CRAFT, and the other evils incident to what is called civilized\r\nsociety, continue to exert and expand ourselves in a proportion\r\ninfinitely greater than anything of which we yet have any notion:—in a\r\n_ratio_ hardly capable of being calculated by any science of which we\r\nare now masters: but which would in time raise man from his present\r\nbiped state to a rank more worthy of his endowments and aspirations; to\r\na rank in which he would be, as it were, _all_ MIND; would enjoy\r\nunclouded perspicacity and perpetual vitality; feed on _oxygene_, and\r\nnever die, but _by his own consent_.\r\n\r\n“But though the poem of the PROGRESS OF MAN alone would be sufficient to\r\nteach this system and enforce these doctrines, the whole practical\r\neffect of them cannot be expected to be produced, but by the gradual\r\nperfecting of each of the sublimer sciences;—at the husk and shell of\r\nwhich we are now nibbling and at the kernel whereof, in our present\r\nstate, we cannot hope to arrive. These several sciences will be the\r\nsubjects of the several _auxiliary_ DIDACTIC POEMS which I have now in\r\nhand (one of which, entitled THE LOVES OF THE TRIANGLES, I herewith\r\ntransmit to you), and for the better arrangement and execution of which,\r\nI beseech you to direct your bookseller to furnish me with a handsome\r\nChambers’s Dictionary; in order that I may be enabled to go through the\r\nseveral articles alphabetically, beginning with _Abracadabra_, under the\r\nfirst letter, and going down to _Zodiac_, which is to be found under the\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n“I am persuaded that there is no science, however abstruse, nay, no\r\ntrade or manufacture, which may not be taught by a didactic poem. In\r\nthat before you, an attempt is made (not unsuccessfully, I hope) to\r\n_enlist the imagination under the banners of Geometry_. _Botany_ I found\r\ndone to my hands. And though the more rigid and unbending stiffness of a\r\nmathematical subject does not admit of the same appeals to the warmer\r\npassions, which naturally arise out of the _sexual_ (or, as I have heard\r\nseveral worthy gentlewomen of my acquaintance, who delight much in the\r\npoem to which I allude, term it, by a slight misnomer no way difficult\r\nto be accounted for—the _sensual_) system of Linnæus;—yet I trust that\r\nthe range and variety of illustration with which I have endeavoured to\r\nornament and enlighten the arid truths of Euclid and Algebra, will be\r\nfound to have smoothed the road of Demonstration, to have softened the\r\nrugged features of Elementary Propositions, and, as it were, to have\r\nstrewed the _Asses’ Bridge_ with flowers.”\r\n\r\nSuch is the account which Mr. HIGGINS gives of his own undertaking, and\r\nof the motives which have led him to it. For our parts, though we have\r\nnot the same sanguine persuasion of the _absolute perfectibility_ of our\r\nspecies, and are in truth liable to the imputation of being more\r\nsatisfied with _things as they are_, than Mr. HIGGINS and his\r\nassociates;—yet, as we are, in at least the same proportion, less\r\nconvinced of the practical influence of didactic poems, we apprehend\r\nlittle danger to our readers’ morals from laying before them Mr.\r\nHIGGINS’S doctrine in its most fascinating shape. The poem abounds,\r\nindeed, with beauties of the most striking kind,—various and vivid\r\nimagery, bold and unsparing impersonifications; and similitudes and\r\nillustrations brought from the most ordinary and the most extraordinary\r\noccurrences of nature—from history and fable—appealing equally to the\r\nheart and to the understanding, and calculated to make the subject of\r\nwhich the poem professes to treat rather amusing than intelligible. We\r\nshall be agreeably surprised to hear that it has assisted any young\r\nstudent at either University in his mathematical studies.\r\n\r\nWe need hardly add, that the plates illustrative of this poem (the\r\nengravings of which would have been too expensive for our publication)\r\nare to be found in Euclid’s Elements, and other books of a similar\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      LOVES OF THE TRIANGLES.[196]\r\n                      ARGUMENT OF THE FIRST CANTO.\r\n\r\n  Warning to the profane not to approach—Nymphs and Deities of\r\n    Mathematical Mythology—Cyclois of a pensive turn—Pendulums, on the\r\n    contrary, playful—and why?—Sentimental Union of the Naiads and\r\n    Hydrostatics—Marriage of Euclid and Algebra.—Pulley the emblem of\r\n    Mechanics—Optics of a licentious disposition—distinguished by her\r\n    telescope and green spectacles.—Hyde-Park Gate on a Sunday\r\n    morning—Cockneys—Coaches.—Didactic Poetry—Nonsensia—Love delights\r\n    in Angles or Corners—Theory of Fluxions explained—Trochais, the\r\n    Nymph of the Wheel—Smoke-Jack described—Personification of\r\n    elementary or culinary Fire.—Little Jack Horner—Story of\r\n    Cinderella—Rectangle, a Magician, educated by Plato and\r\n    Menecmus—in love with Three Curves at the same time—served by\r\n    Gins, or Genii—transforms himself into a Cone—the Three Curves\r\n    requite his passion—Description of them—Parabola, Hyperbola, and\r\n    Ellipsis—Asymptotes—Conjugated Axes.—Illustrations—Rewbell,\r\n    Barras, and Lepaux, the three virtuous Directors—Macbeth and the\r\n    Three Witches—the Three Fates—the Three Graces—King Lear and his\r\n    Three Daughters—Derby Diligence—Catherine Wheel.—Catastrophe of\r\n    Mr. Gingham, with his Wife and Three Daughters overturned in a\r\n    One-horse Chaise—Dislocation and Contusion two kindred Fiends—Mail\r\n    Coaches—Exhortation to Drivers to be careful—Genius of the\r\n    Post-Office—Invention of Letters—Digamma—Double Letters—Remarkable\r\n    Direction of one—Hippona the Goddess of Hack-horses—Parameter and\r\n    Abscissa unite to overpower the Ordinate, who retreats down the\r\n    Axis-Major, and forms himself in a Square—Isosceles, a Giant—Dr.\r\n    Rhomboides—Fifth Proposition, or Asses’ Bridge—Bridge of\r\n    Lodi—Buonaparte—Raft and Windmills—Exhortation to the recovery of\r\n    our Freedom—Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE LOVES OF THE TRIANGLES.\r\n                 A Mathematical and Philosophical Poem,\r\n                        INSCRIBED TO DR.

and Law,\r\n Pollute these pages with unhallow’d paw!\r\n Debased, corrupted, grovelling, and confined,                          5\r\n No DEFINITIONS[198] touch _your_ senseless mind;\r\n To _you_ no POSTULATES[199] prefer their claim,\r\n No ardent AXIOMS[200] _your_ dull souls inflame;\r\n For _you_ no TANGENTS[201] touch, no ANGLES meet,\r\n No CIRCLES[202] join in osculation[203] sweet!               10\r\n\r\n   For _me_, ye CISSOIDS,[204] round my temples bend\r\n Your wandering curves; ye CONCHOIDS[205] extend;\r\n Let playful PENDULES quick vibration feel,\r\n While silent CYCLOIS rests upon her wheel;\r\n Let HYDROSTATICS,[206] simpering as they go,                 15\r\n Lead the light Naiads on fantastic toe;\r\n Let shrill ACOUSTICS[207] tune the tiny lyre;\r\n With EUCLID sage fair ALGEBRA[208] conspire;\r\n The obedient pulley[209] strong MECHANICS ply,\r\n And wanton OPTICS roll the melting eye!                      20\r\n\r\n   I see the fair fantastic forms appear,\r\n The flaunting drapery, and the languid leer;\r\n Fair sylphish forms[210]—who, tall, erect, and slim,\r\n Dart the keen glance, and stretch the length of limb;\r\n To viewless harpings weave the meanless dance,                        25\r\n Wave the gay wreath, and titter as they prance.\r\n\r\n   Such rich confusion[211] charms the ravish’d sight,\r\n When vernal Sabbaths to the Park invite.\r\n Mounts the thick dust, the coaches crowd along,\r\n Presses round Grosvenor Gate th’ impatient throng;                    30\r\n White-muslined misses and mammas are seen,\r\n Linked with gay cockneys, glittering o’er the green:\r\n The rising breeze unnumbered charms displays,\r\n And the tight ankle strikes th’ astonished gaze.\r\n\r\n   But chief, thou Nurse of the Didactic Muse,                         35\r\n Divine NONSENSIA, all thy soul infuse;\r\n The charms of _Secants_ and of _Tangents_ tell,\r\n How Loves and Graces in an _Angle_[212] dwell;\r\n How slow progressive _Points_[213] protract the _Line_,\r\n As pendent spiders spin the filmy twine;                              40\r\n How lengthened _Lines_, impetuous sweeping round,\r\n Spread the wide _Plane_, and mark its circling bound;\r\n How _Planes_, their substance with their motion grown,\r\n Form the huge _Cube_, the _Cylinder_, the _Cone_.\r\n\r\n   Lo! where the chimney’s sooty tube ascends,                         45\r\n The fair TROCHAIS[214] from the corner bends!\r\n Her coal-black eyes upturned, incessant mark\r\n The eddying smoke, quick flame, and volant spark;\r\n Mark with quick ken, where flashing in between,\r\n Her much-loved _Smoke-Jack_ glimmers thro’ the scene;          50\r\n Mark, how his various parts together tend,\r\n Point to one purpose,—in one object end;\r\n The spiral _grooves_ in smooth meanders flow,\r\n Drags the long _chain_, the polished axles glow,\r\n While slowly circumvolves the piece of beef below;                    55\r\n The conscious fire[215] with bickering radiance burns,\r\n Eyes the rich joint, and roasts it as it turns.\r\n\r\n   So youthful Horner rolled the roguish eye,\r\n Cull’d the dark plum from out his Christmas pie,\r\n And cried, in self-applause—“How good a boy am I”.                    60\r\n\r\n   So she, sad victim of domestic spite,\r\n Fair Cinderella, pass’d the wintry night,\r\n In the lone chimney’s darksome nook immured,\r\n Her form disfigured, and her charms obscured.\r\n Sudden her godmother appears in sight,                                65\r\n Lifts the charmed rod, and chants the mystic rite.\r\n The chanted rite the maid attentive hears,\r\n And feels new ear-rings deck her listening ears;[216]\r\n While ’midst her towering tresses, aptly set,\r\n Shines bright, with quivering glance, the smart aigrette;             70\r\n Brocaded silks the splendid dress complete,\r\n And the Glass Slipper grasps her fairy feet.\r\n Six cock-tailed mice[217] transport her to the ball,\r\n And liveried lizards wait upon her call.\r\n Alas! that partial Science should approve\r\n The sly RECTANGLE’S too licentious love!\r\n For _three_ bright nymphs, &c., &c.\r\n\r\n

amid those sultry sands\r\n High on its base where Pompey’s pillar stands,\r\n This learnt the Seer; and learnt, alas! too well,\r\n Each scribbled talisman, and smoky spell:\r\n What muttered charms, what soul-subduing arts,                        85\r\n Fell Zatanai[220] to his sons imparts.\r\n\r\n   GINS[221]—black and huge! who in Dom-Daniel’s[222] cave\r\n Writhe your scorched limbs on sulphur’s[223] azure wave;\r\n Or, shivering, yell amidst eternal snows,\r\n Where cloud-capp’d Caf[224] protrudes his granite toes;               90\r\n (Bound by his will, _Judæa’s_ fabled king,[225]\r\n Lord of _Aladdin’s_ lamp and mystic ring.)\r\n Gins! ye remember!—for your toil conveyed\r\n Whate’er of drugs the powerful charm could aid;\r\n Air, earth, and sea ye searched, and where below                      95\r\n Flame embryo lavas, young volcanoes[226] glow,—\r\n Gins! ye beheld appall’d th’ enchanter’s hand\r\n Wave in dark air th’ _Hypothenusal_ wand;\r\n Saw him the mystic _Circle_ trace, and wheel\r\n With head erect, and far-extended heel;[227]                         100\r\n Saw him, with speed that mocked the dazzled eye,\r\n Self-whirled, in quick gyrations eddying fly:\r\n Till done the potent spell—behold him grown\r\n Fair _Venus’_ emblem—the _Phœnician_ CONE.[228]\r\n\r\n   Triumphs the Seer, and now secure observes                         105\r\n The kindling passions of the _rival_ CURVES.\r\n\r\n   And first, the fair PARABOLA[229] behold,\r\n Her timid arms, with virgin blush, unfold!\r\n Though, on one _focus_ fixed, her eyes betray\r\n A heart that glows with love’s resistless sway;                      110\r\n Though, climbing oft, she strives with bolder grace\r\n Round his tall neck to clasp her fond embrace,\r\n Still ere she reach it, from his polished side\r\n Her trembling hands in devious _Tangents_ glide.\r\n\r\n   Not thus HYPERBOLA;[230]—with subtlest art                115\r\n The blue-eyed wanton plays her changeful part;\r\n Quick as her _conjugated_ axes move\r\n Through every posture of luxurious love,\r\n Her sportive limbs with easiest grace expand;\r\n Her charms unveiled provoke the lover’s hand;                        120\r\n Unveiled, except in many a filmy ray,\r\n Where light _Asymptotes_[231] o’er her bosom play,\r\n Nor touch her glowing skin, nor intercept the day.\r\n\r\n   Yet why, ELLIPSIS,[232] at thy fate repine?\r\n More lasting bliss, securer joys are thine.                          125\r\n Though to each fair his treacherous wish may stray,\r\n Though each, in turn, may seize a transient sway,\r\n ’Tis thine with mild coercion to restrain,\r\n Twine round his struggling heart, and bind with endless chain.\r\n\r\n   Thus, happy France! in thy regenerate land,                        130\r\n Where TASTE with RAPINE saunters hand in hand;\r\n Where, nursed in seats of innocence and bliss,\r\n REFORM greets TERROR with fraternal kiss;\r\n Where mild PHILOSOPHY first taught to scan\r\n The _wrongs_ of PROVIDENCE, and _rights_ of MAN;    135\r\n Where MEMORY broods o’er FREEDOM’S earlier scene,\r\n The _Lantern_ bright, and brighter _Guillotine_;\r\n _Three_ gentle swains evolve their longing arms,\r\n And woo the young REPUBLIC’S virgin charms;\r\n And though proud _Barras_ with the fair succeed,              140\r\n Though not in vain th’ Attorney _Rewbell_ plead,\r\n Oft doth th’ impartial nymph their love forego,\r\n To clasp thy crooked shoulders, blest _Lepaux_!\r\n\r\n   So, with dark dirge athwart the blasted heath,\r\n _Three_ Sister Witches hailed the appalled Macbeth.           145\r\n\r\n   So, the _Three_ Fates beneath grim Pluto’s roof,\r\n Strain the dun warp, and weave the murky woof;\r\n ’Till deadly Atropos with fatal shears\r\n Slits the thin promise of the expected years,\r\n While ’midst the dungeon’s gloom or battle’s din,                    150\r\n Ambition’s victims perish, as they spin.\r\n\r\n   Thus, the _Three_ Graces on the Idalian green\r\n Bow with deft homage to Cythera’s Queen;\r\n Her polished arms with pearly bracelets deck,\r\n Part her light locks, and bare her ivory neck;                       155\r\n Round her fair form ethereal odours throw,\r\n And teach th’ unconscious zephyrs where to blow,\r\n Floats the thin gauze, and glittering as they play,\r\n The bright folds flutter in phlogistic day,.\r\n\r\n   So, with his daughters _Three_, th’ unsceptered Lear        160\r\n Heaved the loud sigh, and poured the glistering tear:\r\n His daughters _Three_, save one alone, conspire\r\n (Rich in his gifts) to spurn their generous sire;\r\n Bid the rude storm his hoary tresses drench,\r\n Stint the spare meal, the hundred knights retrench;                  165\r\n Mock his mad sorrow, and with altered mien\r\n Renounce the daughter, and assert the queen.\r\n A father’s griefs his feeble frame convulse,\r\n Rack his white head, and fire his feverous pulse;\r\n Till kind Cordelia soothes his soul to rest,                         170\r\n And folds the parent-monarch to her breast.\r\n\r\n   Thus some fair spinster grieves in wild affright,\r\n Vexed with dull megrim, or vertigo light;\r\n Pleased round the fair, _Three_ dawdling doctors stand,\r\n Wave the white wig, and stretch the asking hand,                     175\r\n State the grave doubt, the nauseous draught decree,\r\n And all receive, though none deserve, a fee.\r\n\r\n   So down thy hill, romantic Ashbourn,[233] glides\r\n The Derby dilly, carrying _Three_ INSIDES.\r\n One in each corner sits, and lolls at ease,                          180\r\n With folded arms, propt back, and outstretched knees;\r\n While the pressed _Bodkin_, punched and squeezed to death,\r\n Sweats in the midmost place, and scolds, and pants for breath.[234]\r\n\r\n                          (_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                No.

         Thus in threatening accents groaned:\r\n\r\n              “Heed, oh heed our fatal story,\r\n                (I am BRISSOT’S injured Ghost),\r\n              You who hope to purchase

TRIANGLES.\r\n\r\nThe frequent solicitations which we have received for a continuation of\r\nthe LOVES OF THE TRIANGLES have induced us to lay before the public\r\n(with Mr. Higgins’s permission) the concluding lines of the Canto. The\r\ncatastrophe of Mr. and Mrs. Gingham, and the episode of Hippona,\r\ncontained, in our apprehension, several reflections of too free a\r\nnature. The conspiracy of Parameter and Abscissa against the Ordinate is\r\nwritten in a strain of poetry so very splendid and dazzling as not to\r\nsuit the more tranquil majesty of diction which our readers admire in\r\nMr. Higgins. We have therefore begun our extract with the Loves of the\r\nGiant Isosceles, and the Picture of the Asses-Bridge, and its several\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n                         CANTO I.\r\n\r\n                         EXTRACT.\r\n\r\n     ’Twas thine alone, O youth of giant frame,\r\n     Isosceles![240] that rebel heart to tame!\r\n     In vain coy Mathesis[241] thy presence flies:\r\n     Still turn her fond hallucinating[242] eyes;\r\n     Thrills with _Galvanic_ fires[243] each tortuous nerve,\r\n     Throb her blue veins, and dies her cold reserve.\r\n     —Yet strives the fair, till in the giant’s breast\r\n     She sees the mutual passion’s flame confessed:\r\n     Where’er he moves, she sees his tall limbs trace\r\n     _Internal Angles[244] equal at the base_;\r\n     Again she doubts him: but _produced at will_,\r\n     She sees _th’ external Angles equal still_.\r\n\r\n       Say, blest Isosceles! what favouring power,\r\n     Or love, or chance, at night’s auspicious hour,\r\n     While to the Asses-Bridge[245] entranced you strayed,\r\n     Led to the Asses-Bridge the enamoured maid?—\r\n     The Asses-Bridge, for ages doomed to hear\r\n     The deafening surge assault his wooden ear,\r\n     With joy repeats sweet sounds of mutual bliss,\r\n     The soft susurrant sigh, and gently-murmuring kiss.\r\n\r\n       So thy dark arches, _London Bridge_, bestride\r\n     Indignant Thames, and part his angry tide,\r\n     There oft—returning from those green retreats,\r\n     Where fair _Vauxhallia_ decks her sylvan seats;—\r\n     Where each spruce nymph, from city compters free,\r\n     Sips the froth’d syllabub, or fragrant tea;\r\n     While with sliced ham, scraped beef, and burnt champagne,\r\n     Her ’prentice lover soothes his amorous pain;—\r\n     There oft, in well-trimmed wherry, glide along\r\n     Smart beaux and giggling belles, a glittering throng:\r\n     Smells the tarr’d rope—with undulation fine\r\n     Flaps the loose sail—the silken awnings shine;\r\n     “Shoot we the bridge!” the venturous boatmen cry;\r\n     “Shoot we the bridge!” the exulting fare[246] reply.\r\n     —Down the steep fall the headlong waters go,\r\n     Curls the white foam, the breakers roar below.\r\n     The veering helm the dexterous steersman stops,\r\n     Shifts the thin oar, the fluttering canvas drops;\r\n     Then with closed eyes, clenched hands, and quick-drawn breath,\r\n     Darts at the central arch, nor heeds the gulf beneath.\r\n     Full ’gainst the pier the unsteady timbers knock,\r\n     The loose planks, starting, own the impetuous shock;\r\n     The shifted oar, dropp’d sail, and steadied helm,\r\n     With angry surge the closing waters whelm—\r\n     Laughs the glad Thames, and clasps each fair one’s charms,\r\n     That screams and scrambles in his oozy arms.\r\n     Drench’d each smart garb, and clogged each straggling limb,\r\n     Far o’er the stream the Cockneys sink or swim;\r\n     While each badged boatman,[247] clinging to his oar,\r\n     Bounds o’er the buoyant wave, and climbs the applauding shore.\r\n\r\n       So, towering Alp!

Miss Seward, in her _Life of Dr. Darwin_,\r\n  published in 1804, sets no limits to her admiration:—“We are\r\n  presented,” she says, “with an highly imaginative and splendidly\r\n  descriptive poem, whose successive pictures alternately possess the\r\n  sublimity of Michael Angelo, the correctness and elegance of\r\n  Raphael, with the glow of Titian; whose landscapes have, at times,\r\n  the strength of Salvator, and at others the softness of Claude;\r\n  whose numbers are of stately grace, and artful harmony; while its\r\n  allusions to ancient and modern history and fable, and its\r\n  interspersion of recent and extraordinary anecdotes, render it\r\n  extremely entertaining. * * * Each part is enriched by a number of\r\n  philosophical notes. They state a great variety of theories and\r\n  experiments in Botany, Chemistry, Electricity, Mechanics, and in the\r\n  various species of Air, salubrious, noxious, and deadly,” &c.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   THE SCOTTISH “POLITICAL MARTYRS”.\r\n\r\n  [THOMAS MUIR, the younger, of Hunter’s Hill, a promising young\r\n  advocate of the Scottish Bar, and of nigh respectability, was tried\r\n  at Edinburgh, 30th and 31st of August, 1793, before Lord Justice\r\n  Clerk (Braxfield), Lords Henderland, Swinton, Dunsinnan, and\r\n  Abercromby, for Sedition. The weightiest charge against him was that\r\n  of “_lending_” a copy of Paine’s _Rights of Man_ to a person who\r\n  begged a reading of that popular book. He was found guilty, and\r\n  sentenced to fourteen years’ transportation. On the 17th of the\r\n  ensuing month, the Rev. THOS. FYSHE PALMER, a Unitarian Minister of\r\n  Dundee, and an ex-fellow of Queen’s College, Cambridge, was tried at\r\n  Perth for publishing a seditious Address, and sentenced to seven\r\n  years’ transportation. On their arrival at Woolwich, in a revenue\r\n  cutter, they were put on board separate hulks, and assisted at the\r\n  common labour on the banks of the river. MUIR, soon after his\r\n  arrival in New South Wales, effected his escape, in an American\r\n  vessel, to South America, whence he proceeded to Spain. During this\r\n  voyage, in an action with a British frigate, he received a wound in\r\n  the head, from which he recovered; but on his arrival at his\r\n  destination, he was imprisoned by the Spanish authorities, until, on\r\n  the application of M. de Talleyrand in the name of the then\r\n  government of France, he obtained his release. He then went to\r\n  France, and died at Bourdeaux [or Chantilly] in 1799; aged 33.\r\n  PALMER served out his seven years, but died on the homeward voyage.\r\n\r\n  Other Trials soon followed. At the close of December, 1793, MR.\r\n  SKIRVING, MR. GERRALD, and MR. MARGAROT were tried at Edinburgh on\r\n  similar charges of seditious practices, and were all sentenced to\r\n  fourteen years’ transportation. The former two died soon after\r\n  reaching New South Wales. MAURICE MARGAROT, who appears to have\r\n  conducted himself throughout with the most abandoned and shameless\r\n  profligacy, was the only one of these convicts—his fourteen years\r\n  over—who ever set foot again in Britain.\r\n\r\n  GERRALD was a man of very superior ability, and a favourite pupil of\r\n  Dr. Parr’s, as is mentioned by De Quincey in his famous essay on\r\n  that noted Whig pedagogue.\r\n\r\n  On the Scottish “political martyrs” Lord Cockburn, in his posthumous\r\n  _Examination of the Trials for Sedition in Scotland_, published in\r\n  1888, which deals with the twenty-five trials of the above-named\r\n  five and of thirty-two others, between 1793 and 1849, passes his\r\n  deliberate verdict, that, with the exception of Muir, not one of\r\n  them was guiltless. But, like ordinary criminals, they were entitled\r\n  to a fair and impartial trial; and their trials were, one and all,\r\n  iniquitous. Of the six judges who presided in the first fourteen\r\n  (1793–94), five were dull, timid nonentities; the sixth, Lord\r\n  Justice Clerk Braxfield, was, says Lord Cockburn, “a profound\r\n  practical lawyer, and a powerful man; coarse and illiterate ...\r\n  utterly devoid of judicial decorum, and though pure in the\r\n  administration of civil justice, when he was exposed to no\r\n  temptation, with no other conception of principle in any political\r\n  case except that the upholding of his party was a duty attaching to\r\n  his position. Over the five weak men who sat beside him, this coarse\r\n  and dexterous ruffian predominated as he chose.” But Jedburgh—no,\r\n  nor the Bloody Assize itself—could scarcely match one scene in\r\n  Gerrald’s trial:—“‘After all,’ he was urging in his defence, ‘the\r\n  most useful discoveries in philosophy, the most important changes in\r\n  the moral history of man, have been innovations. The Revolution was\r\n  an innovation, Christianity itself was an innovation.’ Instantly\r\n  upon this, the following interruption took place:—Lord Braxfield:\r\n  ‘You would have been stopped long before this, if you had not been a\r\n  stranger. All that you have been saying is sedition. And now, my\r\n  Lords, he is attacking Christianity.’ Lord Henderland: ‘I allow him\r\n  all the benefit of his defence. But ... I cannot sit here as a judge\r\n  without saying that it is a most indecent defence....’ The juries\r\n  were packed as never, surely, before, or afterwards.”\r\n\r\n  With such judges, such juries, and, at least, in two cases, false\r\n  witnesses, it might seem easy to anticipate the result; but the\r\n  result transcends anticipation. In almost every case a light\r\n  sentence would have amply met the requirements of justice; but the\r\n  judges all shared Lord Swinton’s opinion that “it is impossible to\r\n  punish Sedition adequately, now that torture has been abolished”. So\r\n  they strove to supply the deficiency by Transportation, a punishment\r\n  unwarranted by precedent.\r\n\r\n  With respect to Margarot’s trial at Edinburgh, the following is a\r\n  vivid memory of Lord Cockburn’s boyhood:—\r\n\r\n  “MARGAROT came from the Black Bull [in Leith Street] to be tried,\r\n  attended by a procession of the populace and his Convention friends,\r\n  with banners and what was called a tree of liberty. This tree was in\r\n  the shape of the letter M, about twenty feet high and ten wide. The\r\n  honour of bearing it up by carrying the two upright poles was\r\n  assigned to two eminent Conventionalists, and the little culprit\r\n  walked beneath the circular placard in the centre, which proclaimed\r\n  liberty and equality, &c. I was looking out of a window in the old\r\n  Post-Office, which was then the northmost house on the west side of\r\n  the North Bridge. I think I see the scene yet. The whole North\r\n  Bridge, from the Tron Church to the Register Office, was quite empty\r\n  at first; not a single creature venturing on that bit of sand, over\r\n  which the waves were so soon to break from both ends. The\r\n  Post-Office and the adjoining houses had been secretly filled with\r\n  constables, and sailors from a frigate in the roads (I think _The\r\n  Hind_, Capt. Cochrane), all armed with sticks and batons. No soldier\r\n  appeared, it being determined that this civic insurrection should be\r\n  put down by the civil force, unaided, at least, by scarlet. As soon\r\n  as the tree, which led the van, emerged from Leith Street, and\r\n  appeared at the north end of the bridge, Provost Elder and the\r\n  Magistrates issued from some place they had retired to (I believe\r\n  the Tron Church), and appeared, all robed, at the south end. The day\r\n  was good. There was still not one person—I doubt if there was even a\r\n  dog—on any part of the space, being the whole length of the bridge,\r\n  between the two parties. But the rear of each was crammed with\r\n  people, who filled up every inch as those in front moved on. The\r\n  Magistrates were in a line across the street, with the Provost in\r\n  the centre, the city officers behind this line, and probably a\r\n  hundred loyal gentlemen in the rear of the officers. The two parties\r\n  advanced steadily towards each other, and in perfect silence, till\r\n  they met just about the Post-Office. The Provost stepped forward\r\n  about a pace, so that he almost touched the front line of the\r\n  rebels, when, advancing his cane, he commanded them to retire. This\r\n  order probably would not have been obeyed; but, at any rate, it\r\n  could not have been obeyed speedily, from the crowd behind. However,\r\n  all this was immaterial; for, without waiting one instant to see\r\n  whether they meant to retire or not, the houses vomited forth their\r\n  bludgeoned contents, and in almost two minutes the tree was\r\n  demolished and thrown over the bridge, the street covered with the\r\n  knocked down, the accused dragged to the bar, and the insurrection\r\n  was over.”\r\n\r\n  On February 20th, 1837, a meeting took place at the Crown and Anchor\r\n  Tavern, Strand, for commencing a subscription to erect monuments in\r\n  London and Edinburgh to the memory of the above five Reformers.\r\n  Joseph Hume, M.P. was in the chair; Colonel Perronet Thompson, Mr.\r\n  Dan. Whittle Harvey, and fifteen other members of Parliament were\r\n  present. A lofty obelisk was erected on the Calton Hill to the\r\n  memory of the “Scottish Martyrs,” but London did not sympathize with\r\n  the movement.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              JOEL BARLOW.\r\n\r\n  [JOEL BARLOW, born in 1756 in Connecticut, was educated as a\r\n  Presbyterian minister, but afterwards turned Deist. Before this\r\n  change he translated the Psalms into metre, and his version is still\r\n  used in the churches of New England. He now adopted the Law, and\r\n  engaged in periodicals—one, _The Anarchist_, which was political in\r\n  its character, and exercised great influence. In 1788, after\r\n  visiting England, he went to Paris, where he joined the Girondists.\r\n  In 1791, he returned to England, where he published the first part\r\n  of his _Advice to the Privileged Orders_, in which he assails the\r\n  whole system of Government pursued in monarchical Europe, the Church\r\n  establishments, the standing armies, the judicial organisations, and\r\n  the financial systems which belong to the old governments. In\r\n  February, 1792, he published a political poem, which he entitled\r\n  _The Conspiracy of Kings_; also a Letter to the _Convention_\r\n  advising the separation of Church and State. So great did his\r\n  reputation become that he was fixed on by the London Constitutional\r\n  Society to present their Address to the _Convention_. After various\r\n  political transactions in the interest of France, and also in\r\n  commercial speculations which made him a rich man, he left Paris in\r\n  1805, living on his estate in America till 1811, when he was sent as\r\n  Minister Plenipotentiary to Paris. But Napoleon being on his Russian\r\n  Expedition, he followed him to Wilna; but the fatiguing journey\r\n  proved fatal: he died 26th December, 1812. He wrote at an early age\r\n  a poem, _The Vision of Columbus_, which acquired great popularity,\r\n  and which he afterwards enlarged as _The Columbiad_. Among other\r\n  works he published (in 1796) a mock-heroic poem, _Hasty Pudding_,\r\n  which is generally considered his best work.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THEOBALD WOLFE TONE.\r\n\r\n  [THEOBALD WOLFE TONE, the founder of the ASSOCIATION OF UNITED\r\n  IRISHMEN, was born in Dublin in 1764, and, after passing through\r\n  Trinity College, came to London to prosecute his legal studies,\r\n  which he soon forsook for politics, being induced thereto by the\r\n  indignation excited in his breast by the persecution of the Irish\r\n  Catholics, whose cause, although himself a Protestant, he warmly\r\n  advocated. With the view of getting their grievances redressed, he\r\n  founded the society of UNITED IRISHMEN, which gave great alarm to\r\n  the English Government. His liberty being menaced, he went to\r\n  America, and thence to France, where he arranged with Gen. Hoche the\r\n  expeditions to Bantry Bay and the Texel. Being appointed\r\n  Adjutant-General, he served in several of the French armies, and\r\n  lastly in Gen. Hardi’s expedition to Ireland in October, 1798. The\r\n  vessel he was aboard of was captured by the English, and he was\r\n  conveyed to Dublin, tried by a Court-Martial, and sentenced to be\r\n  hanged. He anticipated his execution, however, by committing suicide\r\n  in prison, 19th November, 1798.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ARTHUR O’CONNOR.\r\n\r\n  [On the 21st and 22nd May, 1798, ARTHUR O’CONNOR (proprietor of a\r\n  Dublin newspaper, _The Press_), JOHN BINNS (an active member of the\r\n  _London Corresponding Society_), JOHN ALLEN, JEREMIAH LEARY, and\r\n  JAS. O’COIGLY, _alias_ Jas. Quigley, _alias_ Jas. John Fivey (a\r\n  Priest), were tried at Maidstone for High Treason. ROBERT FERGUSSON\r\n  was counsel for Allen. O’COIGLY only was found Guilty, and was\r\n  executed 7th June, on Pennenden Heath. After being suspended for ten\r\n  minutes, he was cut down and his head severed from his body: the\r\n  disgusting remainder of his sentence was remitted. He met his death\r\n  with great fortitude, and denying to the last the charge of\r\n  treasonable correspondence abroad. In the _State Trials_, vols. 26\r\n  and 27, are included the Life of the prisoner; Observations on his\r\n  Trial; Address to the People of Ireland; and Letters, all written by\r\n  himself during his confinement in Maidstone Gaol. His real name, he\r\n  says, was the Rev. Jas. Coigly, and his age 36. “Can you imagine a\r\n  man more treacherous and profligate than O’COIGLY?” said Sir James\r\n  Mackintosh to DR. PARR. “Yes, Sir, he might have been worse: he was\r\n  a parson—he might have been a lawyer; he was a traitor—he might have\r\n  been an apostate; he was an Irishman—he might have been a\r\n  Scotchman.” When it is recollected that Mackintosh was a Scotchman\r\n  and a lawyer, and that he had written in defence of the French\r\n  Revolution against Burke, these observations of Dr. Parr were both\r\n  insolent and uncalled for.\r\n\r\n  A Portrait of “Arthur O’Connor, late Member in the Irish Parliament\r\n  for Borough of Philipstown, painted by J. Dowling, engraved by W.\r\n  Ward,” was published in London, 18th April, 1798. Another Portrait\r\n  in military uniform is to be found in Barrington’s _Memoirs of the\r\n  Union_. He figures also in several of GILLRAY’S _Caricatures_.\r\n\r\n  In the _Birmingham Daily Post_ of April 2, 1888, it is stated that\r\n  THE HON. R. E. O’CONNOR, M.A., barrister-at-law, the latest addition\r\n  to the Legislative Council of New South Wales, is a grandson of\r\n  ARTHUR O’CONNOR, one of the leaders of the United Irishmen, who died\r\n  a General in the service of France.\r\n\r\n  When O’CONNOR was acquitted by the Jury, on the above-named\r\n  occasion, but before the Judge had given orders for his release, a\r\n  strange scene occurred in court, an attempt being made, as it was\r\n  alleged, by SACKVILLE, EARL OF THANET, ROBERT FERGUSSON (in after\r\n  years known as CUTLAR FERGUSSON, Judge-Advocate-General), and others\r\n  to facilitate his escape in order to avoid further charges about to\r\n  be preferred against him, Binns also being implicated for this\r\n  exploit, which was unsuccessful, but attended with violence. These\r\n  confederates were tried at the Bar of the Court of King’s Bench,\r\n  25th April, 1799. The Counsel for the Crown were Sir John Scott\r\n  [Lord Eldon], Law [Lord Ellenborough], Sir W. Garrow, Sir C. Abbot,\r\n  &c., while the defendants had the powerful advocacy of Erskine and\r\n  others. His Lordship and Mr. Fergusson were found guilty after a\r\n  long and ingenious defence by the latter, which presaged his future\r\n  eminence as a Counsel. LORD THANET was ordered to pay a fine of\r\n  £1000; to be imprisoned in the Tower for a year; and to give\r\n  security for good behaviour for seven years on the expiration of the\r\n  sentence; himself in £10,000, and two sureties in £5000 each.\r\n  FERGUSSON was ordered to pay a fine of £100; to be imprisoned in the\r\n  King’s Bench prison for one year; to give security for good\r\n  behaviour for seven years from the expiration of the sentence;\r\n  himself in £500, and two sureties in £250 each.—See _State Trials_,\r\n  vols. 26 and 27.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          JAMES NAPPER TANDY.\r\n\r\n  [“A person who afterwards made a considerable figure in the local\r\n  affairs of Ireland raised himself about this time into considerable\r\n  notoriety by his patriotic exertions. This was Mr. JAMES NAPPER\r\n  TANDY, a gentleman in the middle station of life, without talent or\r\n  natural influence, had become a warm advocate in the corporation of\r\n  Dublin; he debated zealously in public, he argued strenuously in\r\n  private, and persevered in both with indefatigable ardour. His\r\n  person was ungracious—his language neither eloquent nor\r\n  argumentative—his address neither graceful nor impressive—but he was\r\n  sincere and persevering—and though in many instances erroneous and\r\n  violent, he was considered to be honest. His private character\r\n  furnished no ground to doubt the integrity of his public one—and,\r\n  like many of those persons who occasionally spring up in\r\n  revolutionary periods, he acquired celebrity without being able to\r\n  account for it, and possessed influence without rank or capacity. In\r\n  1796, Mr. Tandy lost all his popularity, and nearly his life, by his\r\n  apparent want of courage in an affair between him and Mr. Toler,\r\n  then Solicitor-General, afterwards Lord Norbury, and Chief Justice\r\n  of the Common Pleas. Mr. Tandy having signified to Mr. Toler his\r\n  desire to fight him, the Chief Justice readily accepted the offer.\r\n  Both parties manœuvred very skilfully; but Mr. Tandy delaying his\r\n  ultimatum too long for the impatience of the Solicitor-General, he\r\n  brought him before the House of Commons for a breach of privilege,\r\n  and prosecuted him for sedition. Mr. Tandy escaped to the Continent,\r\n  entered the French Service, invaded Ireland, was, with his\r\n  confederates, arrested by the British Envoy at Hamburg, 24 Nov.,\r\n  1798, contrary to the law of nations: the Minister of France claimed\r\n  them as French citizens, and the Senate, unwilling to offend either\r\n  power, came to no decision on the subject. Tandy was thereupon taken\r\n  to Ireland and condemned to be hanged—was pardoned by Lord\r\n  Cornwallis, and sent back to France, where he died a French\r\n  General.”—Barrington’s _Memoirs of the Union_, vol. 1, where is a\r\n  portrait of Tandy.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               No. XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           May 14, 1798.\r\n\r\nThe gallant defence of the ISLES OF ST.

An attack was ordered to be made upon the two small\r\n  islands of SAINT MARCOUF (each not more than 200 yards in length),\r\n  of which, in July, 1795, SIR SIDNEY SMITH, with the Diamond frigate,\r\n  had taken unobstructed possession, and which were considered to give\r\n  to the English great facility in intercepting between the ports of\r\n  Havre and Cherbourg. The islands are situated off the river Isigny,\r\n  on the coast of Normandy, and about four miles distant from the\r\n  French shore. After being garrisoned with about 500 seamen and\r\n  marines, including a great proportion of invalids, these small\r\n  islands were placed under the command of LIEUT. CHARLES PAPPS PRICE,\r\n  of _The Badger_, a cruiser-converted Dutch hoy, mounting four, or at\r\n  most six, guns.\r\n\r\n  On the 8th April, 1798, MUSKEIN, with 33 flat-bottomed boats, with a\r\n  body of troops on board, and a few gun-brigs, was about to make a\r\n  combined attack on the two islands, but was driven off by two\r\n  British frigates, THE DIAMOND, _Capt. Sir R. J. Strachan_, and THE\r\n  HYDRA, _Capt. Sir Francis Laforey_, and stood into Caen river. While\r\n  there for three weeks, repairing damages, he was joined by seven\r\n  heavy gun-brigs, and about 40 flat-boats and armed fishing vessels,\r\n  bringing with them additional troops.\r\n\r\n  On the 6th May, LIEUT. PRICE received information that an attack was\r\n  meditated during the night. By 10 p.m., owing to the prevailing\r\n  calm, the small naval force on the station, consisting of the 50–gun\r\n  ship, ADAMANT, _Capt. Wm. Hotham_, 24–gun ship, EURYDICE, _Capt.\r\n  John Talbot_, and 18–gun brig-sloop, ORESTES, _Capt. W. Haggitt_,\r\n  had not been able to approach nearer to the islands than six\r\n  miles—precisely what the assailants wanted. The attacking force\r\n  consisted of 52–gun brigs and flat-bottomed boats, having on board,\r\n  as was reported, about 6000 men. At day-break, on the 7th, the\r\n  flotilla was seen drawn up in a line opposite to the south-west\r\n  front of the western redoubt; and instantly was opened, upon the\r\n  brigs and flats composing it, a fire from 17 pieces of cannon,\r\n  consisting of four 4, two 6, and six 24 pounder long guns, and three\r\n  24 and two 32–pounder carronades, being all the guns that would\r\n  bear. The brigs remained at a distance of from 300 to 400 yards, in\r\n  order to batter the redoubt with their heavy long guns, while the\r\n  boats, with great resolution, rowed up until within musket-shot of\r\n  the battery. But the guns of the latter, loaded with round, grape,\r\n  and canister, soon poured destruction amongst these, cutting several\r\n  of the boats “into chips,” and compelling all that could keep afloat\r\n  to seek their safety in flight. Six or seven boats were seen to go\r\n  down, and one small flat, No. 13, was afterwards towed in, bottom\r\n  upwards. She appeared, by some pieces of paper found in her, to have\r\n  had 144 persons on board, including 129 of the second company of the\r\n  Boulogne battalion.\r\n\r\n  The loss sustained by the British garrison amounted to one\r\n  private-marine killed, and two private-marines and two seamen\r\n  wounded. According to one French account, the invaders lost about\r\n  900 in killed or drowned, and between 300 and 400 wounded. As a\r\n  reward for their conduct on this occasion, Lieutenants PRICE and\r\n  BOURNE were each promoted to the rank of Commander. The former died\r\n  a Post Captain, at Hereford, in 1813, aged 62.—_James’s Naval\r\n  History_, vol. ii., pp. 128–131: ed. 1886.—ED.]\r\n\r\n  [M. PLÉVILLE was Minister of Marine, and, shortly after this\r\n  unsuccessful _début_ of the famous flotilla, was succeeded by\r\n  Rear-Adm. Bruix, who directed Rear-Adm. La Crosse to take the\r\n  command, and to make a second attack upon the islands. This,\r\n  however, the French Government declined to make.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                         HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n  HELEN MARIA WILLIAMS.—[“Among the literary celebrities of the French\r\n  Revolution was Helen Maria Williams, at whose house were wont to\r\n  assemble the most distinguished of the liberal writers of France,\r\n  her own reputation giving considerable _éclat_ to these meetings.\r\n  She wrote some of the most beautiful hymns in our language, was a\r\n  prisoner under the _reign of terror_, and published a work on the\r\n  French Revolution which is full of the most touching incidents, and\r\n  adorned with specimens of the ardent and pathetic poetry, the\r\n  product of French genius under the excitement of those most\r\n  mysterious days. A. Humboldt was much attached to her, and committed\r\n  to her care the translation and publication of some of his most\r\n  elaborate works.\r\n\r\n  “She had two nephews, ATHANAS and CHARLES COQUEREL, whom she\r\n  educated, and who both attained considerable fame, one in the\r\n  theological and the other in the political field. Athanas was for\r\n  some time the preacher in the Protestant Church at Amsterdam, and\r\n  married the daughter of a Swiss gentleman, the only person I have\r\n  ever known on the Continent to adopt the dress and profess the\r\n  opinions of an English Quaker. Miss Williams maintained intimate\r\n  relations with her English friends, was familiar with the great\r\n  lights of the Revolution, and her conversation was most instructive,\r\n  entertaining, and varied. All her sympathies were on the side of\r\n  freedom, and though she was not so prominent as to be persecuted by\r\n  the Emperor, like Madame de Staël, she was the object of a good deal\r\n  of suspicion and narrowly watched by the police.”—_Autobr.\r\n  Recollections by Sir John Bowring_, pp. 353–4.—ED.]\r\n\r\n  [MISS WILLIAMS, for some years, wrote that portion of the _New\r\n  Annual Register_ which relates to France. Among many other\r\n  productions she was the author of the song _Evan Banks_ (to the tune\r\n  of _Savourna Delish_), which has often been attributed to Burns; a\r\n  novel called _Julia_, and a _Tour in Switzerland_. Horace Walpole\r\n  called her in his CORRESPONDENCE a “scribbling trollop”.\r\n\r\n  She lived for many years, and until the death of that gentleman—in\r\n  Paris, 1818—under the _protection_ of JOHN HURFORD STONE, a man of\r\n  letters, who in the early part of the French Revolution had removed\r\n  with his wife to Paris, where he formed an intimacy with Miss\r\n  Williams. She was born about 1762, and died in Paris in 1827 as a\r\n  friend to the Bourbons, and the enemy of the Revolution!\r\n\r\n  This MR. STONE was born at Tiverton in 1763. While in Paris he was\r\n  in the confidence of the Directory, and became one of the chief\r\n  printers there. In 1805, he brought out an edition of the _Geneva\r\n  Bible_, and published several English reprints; also Miss Williams’s\r\n  translation of HUMBOLDT’S _Travels_. His brother, WM. STONE, was\r\n  tried in 1796 for High Treason, for holding treasonable\r\n  correspondence with him.—ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 ELEGY\r\n                  ON THE DEATH OF JEAN BON ST. ANDRÉ.\r\n\r\nThe following exquisite tribute to the memory of an unfortunate\r\nrepublican is written with such a touching sensibility, that those who\r\ncan command salt tears must prepare to shed them. The narrative is\r\nsimple and unaffected; the event in itself interesting; the moral\r\nobvious and awful.—We have only to observe, that as this account of the\r\ntransaction is taken from the French papers, it may possibly be somewhat\r\npartial.—The DEY’S own statement of the affair has not yet been\r\nreceived. Every friend of humanity will join with us in expressing a\r\ncandid and benevolent hope, that this business may not tend to kindle\r\nthe flames of war between these two unchristian powers; but that, by\r\nmutual concession and accommodation, they may come to some point (short\r\nof the restoration of JEAN BON’S head on his shoulders, which in this\r\nstage of the discussion is hardly practicable) by which the peace of the\r\nPagan world may be preserved. For our part, we pretend not to decide\r\nfrom which quarter the concessions ought principally to be made. It is\r\nbut candid to allow that there are probably faults on _both sides_, in\r\nthis, as in most other cases. For the character of the DEY we profess a\r\nsincere respect on the one hand; and on the other, we naturally wish\r\nthat the head of JEAN BON ST. ANDRÉ should be reserved for his own\r\nguillotine.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ELEGY; OR, DIRGE.\r\n\r\n                                    I.\r\n\r\n                All in the town of TUNIS,\r\n                In Africa the torrid,\r\n                  On a Frenchman of rank\r\n                  Was played such a prank,\r\n                As LEPAUX must think quite horrid.\r\n\r\n                                    II.\r\n\r\n                No story half so shocking,\r\n                By kitchen fire or laundry,\r\n                  Was ever heard tell,—\r\n                  As that which befel\r\n                The great JEAN BON ST.

ANDRÉ, we\r\ndiscovered, to our great mortification, that it happened at ALGIERS, and\r\nnot at TUNIS. We should have corrected this mistake, but for two\r\nreasons—first, that ALGIERS would not stand in the verse; and, secondly,\r\nthat we are informed by the young man who conducts the Geographical\r\nDepartment of the _Morning Chronicle_, that both the towns are in\r\nAfrica, or Asia (he is not quite certain which), and, what is more to\r\nthe purpose, that both are peopled by Moors. TUNIS, therefore, may\r\nstand.\r\n\r\n[MARSHAL BERNADOTTÉ, the French _Prince of Monté Corvo_, died as CHARLES\r\nJOHN XIV., _King of Sweden_, 8th March, 1844, in his eighty-first year.\r\nHe married, in 1798, EUGENIA-BERNARDINA-DÉSIRÉE DE CLARY, daughter of a\r\nMarseilles merchant, and sister of MADAME JOSEPH BUONAPARTE (Queen of\r\nSpain). “She, who was not a common-place person,” says MADAME DE\r\nRÉMUSAT, in her valuable _Memoirs_, “had before her marriage been very\r\nmuch in love with Napoleon, and appears to have always preserved the\r\nmemory of that feeling! It has been supposed that her hardly\r\nextinguished passion caused her obstinate refusal to leave France.” She\r\nsurvived her husband many years, and died in Paris, in the Rue d’Anjou\r\nSaint Honoré. Her husband was succeeded on the throne of Sweden by their\r\nson, OSCAR I., who married JOSÉPHINE, _daughter of_ EUGÈNE BEAUHARNAIS,\r\nDuc de Leuchtenberg, and _granddaughter of the_ EMPRESS JOSEPHINE.\r\n\r\nBERNADOTTÉ owed his elevation to the throne to the misgovernment of\r\nGustavus IV., who had brought the nation to the verge of ruin, and who\r\nwas deposed in 1809, when his uncle, the Duke of Sudermania, became king\r\nas Charles XIII.; and the next year, BERNADOTTÉ was elected _Crown\r\nPrince_, and successor to the throne.\r\n\r\nIn 1813, he rendered great assistance to the Allies, for, as Crown\r\nPrince, he joined the confederacy against France with 30,000 men; and,\r\nafter defeating Marshal Ney, with great loss, on the 6th September, he,\r\non the 18th October, with the co-operation of Blücher, again defeated\r\nhim at the decisive Battle of Leipsic; and, on the 19th, the Emperor\r\nAlexander, the King of Prussia, and the Crown Prince, entered the great\r\nsquare of Leipsic, amidst the acclamations of the inhabitants. He was a\r\ndecided democrat, and hated by Napoleon, but was the only sovereign of\r\nthe revolutionary branch who was permitted to retain his dominions after\r\nthe great reaction in 1814. The choice made of this great soldier of\r\nfortune excited the surprise of all Europe at the time, but the wisdom\r\nof it was soon demonstrated by his prudent conduct. He had distinguished\r\nhimself from all Napoleon’s other marshals by his clemency in victory.\r\nFor half a century before his accession, Sweden had not known the peace\r\nand prosperity in which he left the country on his death.\r\n\r\nIn T. RAIKES’S _Diary_ will be found some interesting anecdotes of\r\nBERNADOTTÉ’S gratitude for services rendered him while a young\r\nsubaltern. But one is of a more startling nature, as it records his\r\nnarrow escape from the death intended for him by the widow of the late\r\nking, who had purposely prepared a poisoned cup of coffee for him, which\r\nshe herself presented to him at her own table. Having been suddenly\r\nwarned, he succeeded in forcing it upon her. She resolutely accepted her\r\nfate, and died during the night.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              No. XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           May 21, 1798.\r\n\r\nWe have received the following letter, with the poem that accompanies\r\nit, from a gentleman whose political opinions have hitherto differed\r\nfrom our own; but who appears to feel, as every man who loves his\r\ncountry must, that there can be but one sentiment entertained by\r\nEnglishmen at the present moment.\r\n\r\nWere we at liberty, we should be happy to do justice to the author, and\r\ncredit to ourselves, by mentioning his name.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  TO THE EDITOR OF THE “ANTI-JACOBIN”.\r\n\r\nSIR,—However men may have differed on the political or constitutional\r\nquestions which have of late been brought into discussion—whatever\r\nopinions they may have held on the system or conduct of\r\nadministration—there can surely be now but one sentiment as to the\r\ninstant necessity of firm and strenuous union for the preservation of\r\nour very existence as a people; and if degrees of obligation could be\r\nadmitted, where the utmost is required from all, it should seem that in\r\nthis cause the opposers of administration stand doubly pledged; for with\r\nwhat face of consistency can men pretend to stickle for points of\r\nconstitutional liberty at home, who will not be found amongst the\r\nforemost at their posts to defend their country from the yoke of foreign\r\nslavery?\r\n\r\nThat there should be any set of men so infatuated as not to be convinced\r\nthat the object of the enemy must be the utter destruction of these\r\ncountries, after making the largest allowance for the effects of\r\nprejudice and passion, it is not easy to conceive. Such, however, we are\r\ntold, there are. They believe, then, that after a long series of\r\noutrage, insult, and injury, in the height of their animosity and\r\npresumption, these moderate, mild, disinterested conquerors will invade\r\nus in arms, out of pure love and kindness, merely for our good, only to\r\nmake us wiser, and better, and happier, and more prosperous than before!\r\n\r\nFuture events lie hid in the volume of Fate, but the intentions of men\r\nmay be known by almost infallible indications. Passion and interest, the\r\ntwo mighty motives of human action, determine the Government of France\r\nto attempt the abolition of the British Empire! and if, abandoned by God\r\nand our right arm, we should flinch in the conflict, that destruction\r\nwill be operative to the full of their gigantic and monstrous\r\nimaginations!—Harbours filled up with the ruins of their towns and\r\narsenals, the Thames rendered a vast morass, by burying the Imperial\r\nCity in her bosom—but I will not proceed in the horrible picture.\r\n\r\nAre we then, it may be asked, to wage eternal war?—No; a glorious\r\nresistance leads to an honourable peace. The French people have been\r\nlong weary of the war; their spirit has been forced by a system which\r\nmust end in the failure of the engagement to give them the plunder of\r\nthis country. They will awake from their dream, and raise a cry for\r\npeace, which their government will not dare to resist. The monarchs of\r\nEurope must now begin clearly to perceive that their fate hangs on the\r\ndestiny of England; they will unite to compel a satisfactory peace on a\r\nbroad foundation; and peace, when war has been tried to the utmost, will\r\nprobably be permanent. A few years of wise economy and redoubled\r\nindustry will place us again on the rising scale; and if the pressure of\r\nthe times may have rendered it necessary sometimes to have cast a\r\ntemporary veil over the statue of Liberty, she may again safely be shown\r\nin an unimpaired lustre.\r\n\r\nOf the following verses I have nothing to say: if it should be decided\r\nthat the greatness of the object cannot bear out the mediocrity of the\r\nexecution, I will not appeal from the decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ODE TO MY COUNTRY.\r\n                              MDCCXCVIII.\r\n\r\n                           S. 1.\r\n\r\n         Britons!

The Envoys were told\r\n  that nothing could be done till their Government had advanced a sum\r\n  equal to 1,280,000_l._ as a loan, and 50,000_l._ as a douceur to the\r\n  Directors.

HIGGINS, has not been idle. The\r\ndeserved popularity of the extracts which we have been enabled to give\r\nfrom his two didactic poems, the _Progress of Man_, and the _Loves of\r\nthe Triangles_, has obtained for us the communications of several other\r\nworks which he has in hand, all framed upon the same principle, and\r\ndirected to the same end. The propagation of the New System of\r\nPhilosophy forms, as he has himself candidly avowed to us, the main\r\nobject of all his writings. A system, comprehending not politics only\r\nand religion, but morals and manners, and generally whatever goes to the\r\ncomposition or holding together of human society; in all of which a\r\ntotal change and revolution is absolutely necessary (as he contends) for\r\nthe advancement of our common nature to its true dignity, and to the\r\nsummit of that perfection which the combination of matter, called MAN,\r\nis by its innate energies capable of attaining.\r\n\r\nOf this system, while the sublimer and more scientific branches are to\r\nbe taught by the splendid and striking medium of didactic poetry, or\r\n_ratiocination in rhyme_, illustrated with such paintings and\r\nportraitures of essences and their attributes as may lay hold of the\r\nimagination while they perplex the judgment;—the more ordinary parts,\r\nsuch as relate to the conduct of common life and the regulation of\r\nsocial feelings, are naturally the subject of a less elevated style of\r\nwriting; of a style which speaks to the eye as well as to the ear,—in\r\nshort, of dramatic poetry and scenic representation.\r\n\r\n“With this view,” says MR. HIGGINS (for we love to quote the very words\r\nof this extraordinary and indefatigable writer),—“with this view,” says\r\nhe, in a letter dated from his study in St. Mary Axe, the window of\r\nwhich looks upon the parish pump,—“with this view I have turned my\r\nthoughts more particularly to the German stage, and have composed—in\r\nimitation of the most popular pieces of that country, which have already\r\nmet with so general reception and admiration in this—a Play; which, if\r\nit has a proper run, will, I think, do much to unhinge the present\r\nnotions of men with regard to the obligations of civil society, and to\r\nsubstitute, in lieu of a sober contentment, and regular discharge of the\r\nduties incident to each man’s particular situation, a wild desire of\r\nundefinable latitude and extravagance,—an aspiration after shapeless\r\nsomethings that can neither be described nor understood,—a contemptuous\r\ndisgust at all that _is_, and a persuasion that nothing is as it ought\r\nto be;—to operate, in short, a general discharge of every man (in his\r\nown estimation) from every tie which laws, divine or human, which local\r\ncustoms, immemorial habits, and multiplied examples, impose upon him;\r\nand to set them about doing what they like, where they like, when they\r\nlike, and how they like,—without reference to any law but their own\r\nwill, or to any consideration of how others may be affected by their\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\n“When this is done, my dear sir,” continues Mr. H. (for he writes very\r\nconfidentially)—“you see that a great step is gained towards the\r\ndissolution of the frame of every existing community. I say nothing of\r\n_Governments_, as _their_ fall is of course implicated in that of the\r\nsocial system;—and you have long known that I hold every Government\r\n(that acts by coercion and restriction—by laws made by the few to bind\r\nthe many) as a _malum in se_,—an evil to be eradicated,—a nuisance to be\r\nabated,—by force, if force be practicable; if not, by the artillery of\r\nreason, by pamphlets, speeches, toasts at club-dinners, and though last,\r\nnot least, by didactic poems.\r\n\r\n“But where would be the advantage of the destruction of this or that\r\nGovernment, if the form of Society itself were to be suffered to\r\ncontinue such as that another must necessarily arise out of it and over\r\nit?—Society, my dear sir, in its present state, is a _hydra_. Cut off\r\none head,—another presently sprouts out, and your labour is to begin\r\nagain. At best you can only hope to find it a _polypus_;—where, by\r\ncutting off the _head_, you are sometimes fortunate enough to find a\r\n_tail_ (which answers all the same purposes) spring up in its place.\r\nThis, we know, has been the case in France; the only country in which\r\nthe great experiment of regeneration has been tried with anything like a\r\nfair chance of success.\r\n\r\n“Destroy the frame of society,—decompose its parts,—and see the elements\r\nfighting one against another,—insulated and individual,—every man for\r\nhimself (stripped of prejudice, of bigotry, and of feeling for others)\r\nagainst the remainder of his species;—and there is then some hope of a\r\ntotally new _order of things_,—of a _Radical Reform_ in the present\r\ncorrupt system of the world.\r\n\r\n“The German Theatre appears to proceed on this judicious plan. And I\r\nhave endeavoured to contribute my mite towards extending its effect and\r\nits popularity. There is one obvious advantage attending this mode of\r\nteaching;—that it can proportion the infractions of law, religion, or\r\nmorality, which it recommends, to the capacity of a reader or spectator.\r\nIf you tell a student, or an apprentice, or a merchant’s clerk, of the\r\nvirtue of a Brutus, or of the splendour of a La Fayette, you may excite\r\nhis _desire_ to be equally conspicuous; but how is he to set about it?\r\nWhere is he to find the tyrant to murder? How is he to provide the\r\nmonarch to be imprisoned, and the national guards to be reviewed on a\r\nwhite horse?—But paint the beauties of _forgery_ to him in glowing\r\ncolours;—show him that the presumption of virtue is in favour of rapine\r\nand occasional murder on the highway—and he presently understands you.\r\nThe highway is at hand—the till or the counter is within reach. These\r\n_haberdashers’ heroics_ come home to the business and the bosoms of\r\nmen.—And you may readily make ten _footpads_, where you would not have\r\nmaterials nor opportunity for a single _tyrannicide_.\r\n\r\n“The subject of the piece which I herewith transmit to you is taken from\r\ncommon or middling life; and its merit is that of teaching the most\r\nlofty truths in the most humble style, and deducing them from the most\r\nordinary occurrences. Its moral is obvious and easy; and is one\r\nfrequently inculcated by the German dramas which I have had the good\r\nfortune to see; being no other than ‘_the reciprocal duties of one or\r\nmore husbands to one or more wives, and to the children who may happen\r\nto arise out of this complicated and endearing connection_’. The plot,\r\nindeed, is formed by the combination of the plots of _two_ of the most\r\npopular of these plays (in the same way as Terence was wont to combine\r\ntwo stories of Menander’s). The characters are such as the admirers of\r\nthese plays will recognise for their familiar acquaintances. There are\r\nthe usual ingredients of imprisonments, post-houses and horns, and\r\nappeals to angels and devils.

Soft!—what have we here! [_stumbles over a bundle of\r\nsticks._] This cavern is so dark that I can scarcely distinguish\r\nthe objects under my feet. Oh—the register of my captivity. Let me\r\nsee; how stands the account? [_Takes up the sticks, and turns them\r\nover with a melancholy air; then stands silent for a few minutes,\r\nas if absorbed in calculation._]—Eleven years and fifteen\r\ndays!—Hah! the twenty-eighth of August! How does the recollection\r\nof it vibrate on my heart! It was on this day that I took my last\r\nleave of my Matilda. It was a summer evening; her melting hand\r\nseemed to dissolve in mine, as I prest it to my bosom. Some demon\r\nwhispered me that I should never see her more. I stood gazing on\r\nthe hated vehicle which was conveying her away for ever. The tears\r\nwere petrified under my eyelids. My heart was crystallized with\r\nagony. Anon—I looked along the road. The diligence seemed to\r\ndiminish every instant; I felt my heart beat against its prison,\r\nas if anxious to leap out and overtake it. My soul whirled round\r\nas I watched the rotation of the hinder wheels. A long trail of\r\nglory followed after her, and mingled with the dust; it was the\r\nemanation of Divinity, luminous with love and beauty, like the\r\nsplendour of the setting sun; but it told me that the sun of my\r\njoys was sunk for ever. Yes, here in the depths of an eternal\r\ndungeon, in the nursing cradle of hell, the suburbs of perdition,\r\nin a nest of demons, where despair in vain sits brooding over the\r\nputrid eggs of hope; where agony woos the embrace of death; where\r\npatience, beside the bottomless pool of despondency, sits angling\r\nfor impossibilities. Yet, even _here_, to behold her, to embrace\r\nher! Yes, Matilda, whether in this dark abode, amidst toads and\r\nspiders, or in a royal palace, amidst the more loathsome reptiles\r\nof a court, would be indifferent to me; angels would shower down\r\ntheir hymns of gratulation upon our heads, while fiends would envy\r\nthe eternity of suffering love.... Soft, what air was that? it\r\nseemed a sound of more than human warblings. Again! [_listens\r\nattentively for some minutes._] Only the wind; it is well,\r\nhowever; it reminds me of that melancholy air, which has so often\r\nsolaced the hours of my captivity. Let me see whether the damps of\r\nthis dungeon have not yet injured my guitar.

His relative, LORD ALBEMARLE, says in his\r\n  _Reminiscences_: “Throughout life my kinsman was an enthusiastic\r\n  admirer of the fair sex, which he generally ‘loved, not wisely, but\r\n  too well’”. He married, in 1805, Mdlle. Angélique Gabrielle,\r\n  daughter of the Marquis d’Hazincourt and the Comtesse de Champagne.\r\n\r\n  ADAIR was the son of Mr. Robert Adair, sergeant-surgeon to K. George\r\n  III., by his wife LADY CAROLINE KEPPEL, daughter of Wm. Anne, second\r\n  Earl of Albemarle. He was educated at Westminster School and\r\n  Göttingen University; called to the Bar, but never practised. He\r\n  contested Camelford in 1796; and was M.P. for Appleby, 1799–1802,\r\n  for Camelford, 1802–1812. He was sent by FOX as Minister\r\n  Plenipotentiary to Vienna in 1806; and by his old adversary CANNING\r\n  to Constantinople in 1808; and also to Berlin. He was Ambassador to\r\n  Constantinople, 1809–11, and to Belgium, 1831–5. He was a facile\r\n  writer, and wrote several spirited pamphlets, including defences of\r\n  his relatives, Francis, Duke of Bedford, and Admiral Keppel, Fox,\r\n  and other Whigs. He contributed to the _Political Eclogues_ a poem\r\n  called _Margaret Nicholson_, in which George III., Pitt, Jenkinson,\r\n  &c., were ridiculed, and the _Song of Scrutina_ (on the “Westminster\r\n  Scrutiny”), in the style of Ossian, in the _Probationary Odes for\r\n  the Laureateship_. He was the author also of an account of his\r\n  _Mission to the Court of Vienna_; and his _Negotiations for the\r\n  Peace of the Dardanelles_: 3 vols., 8vo. For his services in the\r\n  latter business he was made G.C.B. He was born 24th May, 1763, and\r\n  died 3rd Oct., 1855.\r\n\r\n  There is a curious circumstance connected with the composition of\r\n  this song, the first five stanzas of which were written by CANNING.\r\n  Having been accidentally seen, previous to its publication, by PITT,\r\n  who was cognisant of the proceedings of the “Anti-Jacobin” writers,\r\n  he was so amused with it, that he took up a pen and composed the\r\n  last stanza on the spot.—ED.]\r\n\r\n  [This drama was produced at the Haymarket Theatre, July 26, 1811,\r\n  with alterations and additions, and some introductory matter, which\r\n  contained smart hits at the Quadrupeds, which then desecrated the\r\n  stage of Covent Garden Theatre. Liston performed _Rogero_; Munden,\r\n  _Casimere_; Mrs. Glover, _Matilda_; Mrs. Gibbs, _Cecilia_. The\r\n  following Prologue, written by George Colman the younger, in\r\n  imitation of Pope’s prologue to _Cato_, was spoken by Elliston:—\r\n\r\n         To lull the soul by spurious strokes of art,\r\n         To warp the genius, and mislead the heart;\r\n         To make mankind revere wives gone astray,[274]\r\n         Love pious sons who rob on the highway;[275]\r\n         For this the foreign muses trod our stage\r\n         Commanding _German schools_ to be the rage.\r\n         Hail to such schools! Oh, fine _false feeling_, hail!\r\n         Thou badst _non-natural nature_ to prevail;\r\n         Through thee, _soft super-sentiment_ arose,\r\n         Musk to the mind like civet to the nose;\r\n         Till fainting taste (as invalids do wrong),\r\n         Snuff’d the sick perfume, and grew weakly strong.\r\n         Dear Johnny Bull! you boast much resolution,\r\n         With, thanks to Heaven! a glorious Constitution:\r\n         Your taste, recovered half from foreign quacks,\r\n         Takes airings, now, on English horses’ backs;\r\n         While every modern bard may raise his name,\r\n         If not on _lasting praise_, on _stable fame_.\r\n         Think that to Germans you have given no check,\r\n         Think how each actor hors’d has risk’d his neck;\r\n         You’ve shewn them favour: Oh, then, once more shew it\r\n         To this night’s _Anglo-German, Horse-Play_ Poet!—ED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               No. XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        June 11, 1798.\r\n\r\n  We have received, in the course of the last week, several long, and\r\n  to say the truth, dull letters, from unknown hands, reflecting in\r\n  very severe terms on MR. HIGGINS, for having, as it is affirmed,\r\n  attempted to pass upon the world, as a faithful sample of the\r\n  productions of the German theatre, a performance no way resembling\r\n  any of those pieces which have so late excited, and which bid fair\r\n  to engross, the admiration of the British public.\r\n\r\n  As we cannot but consider ourselves as the guardians of MR.\r\n  HIGGINS’S literary reputation, in respect to every work of his which\r\n  is conveyed to the world through the medium of our paper (though,\r\n  what we think of the danger of his principles we have already\r\n  sufficiently explained for ourselves, and have, we trust, succeeded\r\n  in putting our readers upon their guard against them)—we hold\r\n  ourselves bound not only to justify the fidelity of the imitation,\r\n  but (contrary to our original intention) to give a further specimen\r\n  of it in our present number, in order to bring the question more\r\n  fairly to issue between our author and his calumniators.\r\n\r\n  In the first place we are to observe, that MR. HIGGINS professes to\r\n  have taken his notion of German plays wholly from the translations\r\n  which have appeared in our language. If _they_ are totally\r\n  dissimilar from the originals, Mr. H. may undoubtedly have been led\r\n  into error; but the fault is in the translators, not in him. That he\r\n  does not differ widely from the models which he proposed to himself,\r\n  we have it in our power to prove satisfactorily, and might have done\r\n  so in our last number, by subjoining to each particular passage of\r\n  his play the scene in some one or other of the German plays which he\r\n  had in view when he wrote it. These parallel passages were\r\n  faithfully pointed out to us by Mr. H. with that candour which marks\r\n  his character; and if they were suppressed by us (as in truth they\r\n  were), on our heads be the blame, whatever it may be. Little,\r\n  indeed, did we think of the imputation which the omission would\r\n  bring upon Mr. H., as in fact our principal reason for it was the\r\n  apprehension that, from the extreme closeness of the imitation in\r\n  most instances, he would lose in praise for invention more than he\r\n  would gain in credit for fidelity.\r\n\r\n  The meeting between Matilda and Cecilia, for example, in the first\r\n  act of _The Rovers_, and their sudden intimacy, has been censured as\r\n  unnatural. Be it so. It is taken, _almost word for word_, from\r\n  _Stella_, a German (or professedly a German) piece now much in\r\n  vogue; from which also the catastrophe of MR. HIGGINS’S play is in\r\n  part borrowed, so far as relates to the agreement to which the\r\n  ladies come, as the reader will see by and bye, to share Casimere\r\n  between them.\r\n\r\n  The dinner-scene is copied partly from the published translation of\r\n  _The Stranger_, and partly from the first scene of _Stella_. The\r\n  song of Rogero, with which the first act concludes, is admitted on\r\n  all hands to be in the very first taste; and if no German original\r\n  is to be found for it, so much the worse for the credit of German\r\n  literature.\r\n\r\n  An objection has been made by one anonymous letter-writer to the\r\n  names of Puddingfield and Beefington, as little likely to have been\r\n  assigned to English characters by any author of taste or\r\n  discernment. In answer to this objection we have, in the first\r\n  place, to admit, that a small, and we hope not an unwarrantable,\r\n  alteration has been made by us since the MS. has been in our hands.\r\n  These names stood originally Puddincrantz and Beefinstern, which\r\n  sounded to our ears as being liable, especially the latter, to a\r\n  ridiculous inflection—a difficulty that could only be removed by\r\n  furnishing them with English terminations. With regard to the more\r\n  substantial syllables of the names, our author proceeded, in all\r\n  probability, on the authority of Goldoni, who, though not a German,\r\n  is an Italian writer of considerable reputation; and who, having\r\n  heard that the English were distinguished for their love of liberty\r\n  and beef, has judiciously compounded the two words _Runnymede_ and\r\n  _Beef_, and thereby produced an English nobleman, whom he styles\r\n  _Lord Runnybeef_.\r\n\r\n  To dwell no longer on particular passages, the best way perhaps of\r\n  explaining the whole scope and view of Mr. H.’s imitation will be to\r\n  transcribe the short sketch of the plot which that gentleman\r\n  transmitted to us, together with his drama, and which it is perhaps\r\n  the more necessary to give at length, as, the limits of our paper\r\n  not allowing of the publication of the whole piece, some general\r\n  knowledge of its main design may be acceptable to our readers, in\r\n  order to enable them to judge of the several extracts which we lay\r\n  before them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 PLOT.\r\n\r\n  Rogero, son of the late minister of the Count of Saxe Weimar, having\r\n  while he was at college, fallen desperately in love with Matilda\r\n  Pottingen, daughter of his tutor, Doctor Engelbertus Pottingen,\r\n  Professor of Civil Law; and Matilda evidently returning his passion,\r\n  the Doctor, to prevent ill consequences, sends his daughter on a\r\n  visit to her aunt in Wetteravia, where she becomes acquainted with\r\n  Casimere, a Polish Officer, who happens to be quartered near her\r\n  aunt’s, and has several children by him.\r\n\r\n  Roderic, Count of Saxe Weimar, a prince of a tyrannical and\r\n  licentious disposition, has for his Prime Minister and favourite\r\n  Gaspar, a crafty villain, who had risen to his post by first\r\n  ruining, and then putting to death, Rogero’s father. Gaspar,\r\n  apprehensive of the power and popularity which the young Rogero may\r\n  enjoy at his return to Court, seizes the occasion of his intrigue\r\n  with Matilda (of which he is apprized officially by Doctor\r\n  Pottingen) to procure from his master an order for the recall of\r\n  Rogero from college, and for committing him to the care of the Prior\r\n  of the Abbey of Quedlinburgh, a priest, rapacious, savage, and\r\n  sensual, and devoted to Gaspar’s interests—sending at the same time\r\n  private orders to the Prior to confine him in a dungeon.\r\n\r\n  Here Rogero languishes many years. His daily sustenance is\r\n  administered to him through a grated opening at the top of a cavern,\r\n  by the landlady of the Golden Eagle at Weimar, with whom Gaspar\r\n  contracts, in the prince’s name, for his support; intending, and\r\n  more than once endeavouring, to corrupt the waiter to mingle poison\r\n  with the food, in order that he may get rid of Rogero for ever.\r\n\r\n  In the meantime, Casimere, having been called away from the\r\n  neighbourhood of Matilda’s residence to other quarters, becomes\r\n  enamoured of and marries Cecilia, by whom he has a family; and whom\r\n  he likewise deserts after a few years’ cohabitation, on pretence of\r\n  business which calls him to Kamtschatka.\r\n\r\n  Doctor Pottingen, now grown old and infirm, and feeling the want of\r\n  his daughter’s society, sends young Pottingen in search of her, with\r\n  strict injunctions not to return without her; and to bring with her\r\n  either her present lover Casimere, or, should that not be possible,\r\n  Rogero himself, if he can find him; the Doctor having set his heart\r\n  upon seeing his children comfortably settled before his death.\r\n  Matilda, about the same period, quits her aunt’s in search of\r\n  Casimere; and Cecilia, having been advertised (by an anonymous\r\n  letter) of the falsehood of his Kamtschatka journey, sets out in the\r\n  post-waggon on a similar pursuit.\r\n\r\n  It is at this point of time the Play opens—with the accidental\r\n  meeting of Cecilia and Matilda at the Inn at Weimar. Casimere\r\n  arrives there soon after, and falls in first with Matilda, and then\r\n  with Cecilia. Successive _éclaircissements_ take place, and an\r\n  arrangement is finally made, by which the two ladies are to live\r\n  jointly with Casimere.\r\n\r\n  Young Pottingen, wearied with a few weeks’ search, during which he\r\n  has not been able to find either of the objects of it, resolves to\r\n  stop at Weimar, and wait events there. It so happens that he takes\r\n  up his lodgings in the same house with Puddingfield and Beefington,\r\n  two English noblemen, whom the tyranny of King John has obliged to\r\n  fly from their country; and who, after wandering about the continent\r\n  for some time, have fixed their residence at Weimar.\r\n\r\n  The news of the signature of Magna Charta arriving, determines\r\n  Puddingfield and Beefington to return to England. Young Pottingen\r\n  opens his case to them, and entreats them to stay to assist him in\r\n  the object of his search.—This they refuse; but coming to the Inn\r\n  where they are to set off for Hamburgh, they meet Casimere, from\r\n  whom they had both received many civilities in Poland.\r\n\r\n  Casimere, by this time tired of his “DOUBLE ARRANGEMENT,” and having\r\n  learnt from the waiter that Rogero is confined in the vaults of the\r\n  neighbouring abbey _for love_, resolves to attempt his rescue, and\r\n  to make over Matilda to him as the price of his deliverance. He\r\n  communicates his scheme to Puddingfield and Beefington, who agree to\r\n  assist him; as also does young Pottingen. The Waiter of the Inn,\r\n  proving to be a _Knight Templar_ in disguise, is appointed leader of\r\n  the expedition. A band of Troubadours, who happen to be returning\r\n  from the Crusades, and a company of Austrian and Prussian Grenadiers\r\n  returning from the Seven Years’ War, are engaged as troops.\r\n\r\n  The attack on the Abbey is made with success. The Count of Weimar\r\n  and Gaspar, who are feasting with the Prior, are seized and beheaded\r\n  in the refectory. The Prior is thrown into the dungeon from which\r\n  Rogero is rescued. Matilda and Cecilia rush in. The former\r\n  recognises Rogero, and agrees to live with him. The children are\r\n  produced on all sides—and young Pottingen is commissioned to write\r\n  to his father, the Doctor, to detail the joyful events which have\r\n  taken place, and to invite him to Weimar to partake of the general\r\n  felicity.\r\n\r\n\r\n                THE ROVERS; OR, THE DOUBLE ARRANGEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                ACT II.\r\n\r\n  _Scene, a Room in an ordinary Lodging-house at Weimar_—PUDDINGFIELD\r\n    _and_ BEEFINGTON _discovered sitting at a small deal table, and\r\n    playing at All-fours—Young_ POTTINGEN, _at another table in the\r\n    corner of the room, with a pipe in his mouth, and a Saxon mug of a\r\n    singular shape beside him, which he repeatedly applies to his\r\n    lips, turning back his head, and casting his eyes towards the\r\n    firmament—at the last trial he holds the mug for some moments in a\r\n    directly inverted position; then replaces it on the table with an\r\n    air of dejection, and gradually sinks into a profound slumber—the\r\n    pipe falls from his hand, and is broken._\r\n\r\nBEEF.

The simplicity of her\r\nappearance—the fineness of the weather—all conspired to interest me—my\r\nheart moved to hers—as if by magnetic sympathy. We wept, embraced, and\r\nwent home together: she became the mother of my Pantalowsky.

The\r\nwhole was conducted with the utmost secrecy and dispatch, and it was not\r\ntill we were favoured with the following copy of a letter (obligingly\r\ncommunicated to us by the Tunisian gentleman to whom it is addressed)\r\nthat we had any suspicion of the extent and nature of the design, or\r\nindeed of any such design being in contemplation.\r\n\r\nThe several great names which are combined to render this Expedition the\r\nmost surprising and splendid ever undertaken, could not indeed have been\r\nspared from the country to which they are an ornament for any other\r\npurpose than one the most obviously connected with the interests of the\r\nempire, and the most widely beneficial to mankind.\r\n\r\nThe secrecy with which they have been withdrawn from the British public,\r\nwithout being so much as missed or enquired after, reflects the highest\r\nhonour on the planners of the enterprise. Even the celebrity of DOCTOR\r\nPARR has not led to any discovery or investigation: the silent admirers\r\nof that great man have never once thought of asking what was become of\r\nhim; till it is now all at once come to light, that he has been for\r\nweeks past on shipboard, the brightest star in the bright constellation\r\nof talents which stud the quarter-deck of the _Capricorn_, Mr. T. Truman\r\n(as before mentioned), Commander.\r\n\r\nThe resignation of the late worthy President of a certain Agricultural\r\nBoard[293] might indeed have taught mankind to look for some\r\nextraordinary event in the world of science and adventure; and those who\r\nhad the good fortune to see the deportation from his house, of the\r\nseveral wonderful anomalies which had for years formed its most\r\ndistinguished inmates,—the stuffed ram, the dried boar, the cow with\r\nthree horns, and other fanciful productions of a like nature, could not\r\nbut speculate with some degree of seriousness on the purpose of their\r\nremoval, and on the place of their destination.\r\n\r\nIt now appears that there was in truth no light object in view. They\r\nwere destined, with the rest of the _savans_, on whom this country\r\nprides itself (and long may it have reason to indulge the honest\r\nexultation), to undertake a voyage of no less grandeur than peril; to\r\ncounteract the designs of the Directory, and to frustrate or forestal\r\nthe conquests of Buonaparte.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman who writes the following letter to his friend in\r\nLondon is, as may be seen, interpreter to the Expedition. We have\r\nunderstood, further, that he is connected with the young man who writes\r\nfor the _Morning Chronicle_, and conducts the _Critical, Argumentative_,\r\nand _Geographical_ departments. Some say it is the young man himself,\r\nwho has assumed a feigned name, and, under the disguise of a Turkish\r\ndress and circumcision, is gone, at the express instigation of his\r\nemployers, to improve himself in geographical knowledge. We have our\r\ndoubts upon this subject, as we think we recognise the style of this\r\ndeplorable young man in an article of last week’s _Morning Chronicle_,\r\nwhich we have had occasion to answer in a preceding column of our\r\npresent paper. Be that as it may, the information contained in the\r\nfollowing letter may be depended upon.\r\n\r\nWe cannot take leave of the subject without remarking what a fine\r\ncontrast and companion the vessel and cargo described in the following\r\npoem affords [_sic_] to the “NAVIS STULTIFERA,” the “SHIPPE OF FOOLES”\r\nof the celebrated BARCLAY; and we cannot forbear hoping that the\r\n_Argenis_ of an author of the same name may furnish a hint for an\r\naccount of this stupendous Expedition in a learned language, from the\r\nonly pen which in modern days is capable of writing Latin with a purity\r\nand elegance worthy of so exalted a theme, and that the author of a\r\nclassical _preface_[294] may become the writer of a no less celebrated\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        TRANSLATION OF A LETTER,\r\n                        (IN ORIENTAL CHARACTERS)\r\n                   FROM BAWBA-DARA-ADUL-PHOOLA,[295]\r\n                      DRAGOMAN TO THE EXPEDITION,\r\n                      TO NEEK-AWL-ARETCHID-KOOEZ,\r\n                   SECRETARY TO THE TUNISIAN EMBASSY.\r\n\r\n  DEAR NEEK-AWL,\r\n\r\n    You’ll rejoice, that at length I am able,\r\n    To date these few lines from the captain’s own table.\r\n    Mr. Truman himself, of his proper suggestion,\r\n    Has in favour of science decided the question;\r\n    So we walk the main-deck, and are mess’d with the captain,\r\n    I leave you to judge of the joys we are wrapt in.\r\n\r\n      At Spithead they embark’d us, how precious a cargo!\r\n    And we sail’d before day to escape the embargo.\r\n    There was SHUCKBOROUGH,[296] the wonderful mathematician;\r\n    And DARWIN, the poet, the sage, and physician;\r\n    There was BEDDOES, and BRUIN, and GODWIN, whose trust is,\r\n    He may part with his work on _Political Justice_\r\n    To some Iman or Bonze, or Judaical Rabbin;\r\n    So with huge quarto volumes he piles up the cabin.\r\n    There was great DR. PARR whom we style _Bellendenus_,\r\n    The Doctor and I have a hammock between us.\r\n    ’Tis a little unpleasant thus crowding together,\r\n    On account of the motion and heat of the weather;\r\n    _Two_ souls in one berth they oblige us to cram,\r\n    And Sir John[297] _will_ insist on a place for his ram.\r\n    Though the Doctor, I find, is determined to think\r\n    ’Tis the animal’s hide that occasions the stink;\r\n    In spite of th’ experienced opinion of Truman,\r\n    Who contends that the scent is exclusively human.\r\n    But BEDDOES and DARWIN engage to repair\r\n    This slight inconvenience with _oxygen_ air.\r\n\r\n      Whither bound? (you will ask). ’Tis a question, my friend,\r\n    On which I long doubted; my doubt’s at an end.\r\n    To Arabia the Stony, Sabæa the gummy,\r\n    To the land where each man that you meet is a mummy;\r\n    To the mouths of the Nile, to the banks of Araxes,\r\n    To the _Red_ and the _Yellow_, the _White_ and the _Black_ seas,\r\n    With telescopes, globes, and a quadrant and sextant,\r\n    And the works of all authors whose writings are extant;\r\n    With surveys and plans, topographical maps,\r\n    Theodolites, watches, spring-guns and steel-traps,\r\n    Phials, crucibles, air-pumps, electric machinery,\r\n    And pencils for painting the natives and scenery.\r\n    In short, we are sent to oppose all we know\r\n    To the knowledge and mischievous arts of the foe,\r\n    Who, though placing in arms a well-grounded reliance,\r\n    Go to war with a flying artillery of science.\r\n\r\n      The French _savans_, it seems, recommended this measure,\r\n    With a view to replenish the national treasure.\r\n    First, the true _Rights of Man_ they will preach in all places,\r\n    But chief (when ’tis found) in the Egyptian Oasis:\r\n    And this doctrine, ’tis hoped, in a very few weeks\r\n    Will persuade the wild Arabs to murder their cheiks,\r\n    And, to aid the _Great Nation’s_ beneficent plans,\r\n    Plunder pyramids, catacombs, towns, caravans,\r\n    Then enlist under Arcolé’s gallant commander,\r\n    Who will conquer the world like his model ISKANDER.\r\n    His army each day growing bolder and finer,\r\n    With the Turcoman tribes he subdues Asia Minor,\r\n    Beats Paul and his Scythians, his journey pursues\r\n    Cross the Indus, with tribes of Armenians and Jews,\r\n    And Bucharians, and Affghans, and Persians, and Tartars,—\r\n    Chokes the wretched Mogul in his grandmother’s garters,\r\n    And will hang him to dry in the Luxembourg hall,\r\n    ’Midst the plunder of Carthage and spoils of Bengal.\r\n\r\n      Such, we hear, was the plan; but I trust, if we meet ’em,\r\n    That _savant_ to _savant_, our cargo will beat ’em.\r\n    Our plan of proceeding I’ll presently tell;—\r\n    But soft—I am call’d—I must bid you farewell:\r\n    To attend on our _savans_ my pen I resign,\r\n    For, it seems, that they _duck_ them on _crossing_ the Line.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe deeply regret this interruption of our oriental poet, and the more\r\nso, as the prose letters which we have received from a less learned\r\ncorrespondent do not enable us to explain the tactics of our belligerent\r\nphilosophers so distinctly as we could have wished. It appears, in\r\ngeneral, that the learned Doctor who has the honour of sharing the\r\nhammock of the amiable oriental, trusted principally to his superior\r\nknowledge in the Greek language, by means of which he hoped to entangle\r\nhis antagonists in inextricable confusion. DR. DARWIN proposed (as might\r\nbe expected) his celebrated experiment of the Ice-island,[298] which,\r\nbeing towed on the coast of Africa, could not fail of spoiling the\r\nclimate, and immediately terrifying and embarrassing the sailors of\r\nBuonaparte’s fleet, accustomed to the mild temperature and gentle gales\r\nof the Mediterranean, and therefore ill qualified to struggle with this\r\nnew importation of tempests. DR. BEDDOES was satisfied with the project\r\nof communicating to Buonaparte a consumption, of the same nature with\r\nthat which he formerly tried on himself, but superior in virulence, and\r\ntherefore calculated to make the most rapid and fatal ravages in the\r\nhectic constitution of the Gallic hero. The rest of the plan is quite\r\nunintelligible, excepting a hint about Sir J. S.’s intention of\r\nproceeding with his ram to the celebrated Oasis, and of bringing away,\r\nfor the convenience of the Bank, the treasures contained in the temple\r\nof Jupiter Ammon.\r\n\r\n\r\n                FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE EXTRAORDINARY.[299]\r\n\r\n  The Priority of Intelligence which has ever distinguished OUR PAPER\r\n  will, We trust, receive additional lustre from the extraordinary\r\n  News which We now lay before the Public.

Health and Fraternity.\r\n\r\n                                                         “BUONAPARTÉ.”\r\n\r\n                             “_Head-Quarters_, Salamis, _18 Prairial_.\r\n\r\n  “Citizens directors,\r\n\r\n  “The brave Soldiers, who conferred Liberty on _Rome_, have continued\r\n  to deserve well of their Country. _Greece_ has joyfully received her\r\n  Deliverers. The Tree of Liberty is planted on the _Piræus_. Thirty\r\n  thousand Janizaries, the Slaves of Despotism, had taken possession\r\n  of the Isthmus of _Corinth_. Two Demi-brigades opened us a passage.\r\n  After ten days’ fighting, we have driven the _Turks_ from the\r\n  _Morea_. The _Peloponnesus_ is now free. Every step in my power has\r\n  been taken to revive the antient spirit of _Sparta_. The Inhabitants\r\n  of that celebrated City, seeing _black broth_ of my Troops, and the\r\n  scarcity of specie to which we have been long accustomed, will, I\r\n  doubt not, soon acquire the frugal virtues of their Ancestors. As a\r\n  proper measure of precaution, I have removed all PITT’S gold from\r\n  the Country.\r\n\r\n  “Off this Island we encountered the Fleet of the SULTAN. The\r\n  Mahometan Crescent soon fled before the three-coloured flag. Nine\r\n  Sail of the Line are the fruits of this Victory. The CAPTAIN PACHA’S\r\n  Ship, a second rate, struck to a National Corvette. My Aide-de-Camp\r\n  will present you with the model of a _Trireme_, which was found\r\n  among the Archives of _Athens_. Vessels of this description draw so\r\n  little water, that our Naval Architects may perhaps think them more\r\n  eligible than Rafts, for the conveyance of the _Army of England_.\r\n  Liberty will be sufficiently avenged, if the ruins of a Grecian City\r\n  furnish us with the means of transporting the Conquerors of _Rome_\r\n  to _Britain_.\r\n\r\n  “On landing at this Island, I participated in a Scene highly\r\n  interesting to Humanity. A poor Fisherman, of the family of\r\n  THEMISTOCLES, attended by his Wife, a descendant of the virtuous\r\n  PHRYNE, fell at my feet. I received him with the Fraternal embrace,\r\n  and promised him the protection of the Republic. He invited me to\r\n  supper at his Hut, and in gratitude to his Deliverer presented me\r\n  with a memorable _Oyster Shell_, inscribed with the Name of his\r\n  illustrious Ancestor. As this curious piece of antiquity may be of\r\n  service to some of the DIRECTORY, I have inclosed it in my\r\n  Dispatches, together with a Marble Tablet, containing the proper\r\n  form for pronouncing the Sentence of _Ostracism_ on _Royalist\r\n  Athenians_.\r\n\r\n  “KLÉBER, whom I had ordered to _Constantinople_, informs me that the\r\n  Capital of Turkey has proved an easy conquest. _Santa-Sophia_ has\r\n  been converted into a Temple of Reason; the _Seraglio_ has been\r\n  purified by _Theo-Philanthropists_, and the liberated Circassians\r\n  are learning from our Sailors the lessons of Equality and\r\n  Fraternity. A Detachment has been sent to Troy, for the purpose pf\r\n  organizing the Department of _Mount Ida_. The Tomb of ACHILLES has\r\n  been repaired, and the Bust of BRISEIS (which formed part of the\r\n  Pedestal) restored to its original state, at the expense of the\r\n  Female Citizen BUONAPARTÉ.\r\n\r\n  “The Division of the Fleet destined for Egypt has anchored in the\r\n  Port of _Alexandria_. BERTHIER, who commands this Expedition,\r\n  informs me that this Port will soon be restored to its ancient\r\n  pre-eminence; and that its celebrated _Pharos_ will soon be fit to\r\n  receive the _Reverbères_ which have been sent from the _Rue St.\r\n  Honoré_.\r\n\r\n  “BARAGUAY D’HILLIERS, with the Left Wing of the _Army of Egypt_, has\r\n  fixed his Head-quarters at _Jerusalem_. He is charged to restore the\r\n  Jews to their ancient Rights. Citizens Jacob Jacobs, Simon Levi, and\r\n  Benjamin Solomons, of Amsterdam, have been provisionally appointed\r\n  Directors. The Palace of _Pontius Pilate_ is re-building for their\r\n  residence. All the vestiges of Superstition in _Palestine_ have been\r\n  carefully destroyed.\r\n\r\n  “I beg you will ratify a grant which I have made of the _Temple of\r\n  the Sun_ at _Palmyra_ to a Society of _Illuminati_ from _Bavaria_.\r\n  They may be of service in extending our future conquests.\r\n\r\n  “I have received very satisfactory accounts from DESAIX, who had\r\n  been sent by BERTHIER with a Demi-brigade into the interior of\r\n  _Africa_. That fine Country has been too long neglected by\r\n  Europeans. In manners and civilization it much resembles France, and\r\n  will soon emulate our virtues. Already does the Torrid Zone glow\r\n  with the ardour of Freedom. Already has the Altar of Liberty been\r\n  reared in the _Caffrarian_ and _Equinoctial Republics_. Their\r\n  regenerated inhabitants have sworn eternal amity to us at a Civic\r\n  Feast, to which a detachment of our Army was invited. This memorable\r\n  day would have terminated with the utmost harmony, if the CAFFRARIAN\r\n  COUNCIL of ANCIENTS had not devoured the greatest part of General\r\n  Desaix’s État-Major for their supper. I hope our Ambassador will be\r\n  instructed to require that Civic Feasts of this nature be omitted\r\n  for the future. The Directory of the _Equinoctial Republic_ regret\r\n  that the scarcity of British Cloth in Africa, and the great heat of\r\n  the climate, prevent them from adopting our _costume_.\r\n\r\n  “We hope soon to liberate the _Hottentots_, and to drive the\r\n  perfidious _English_ from the extremities of Africa and of Europe.\r\n  _Asia_, too, will soon be free. The three-coloured flag floats on\r\n  the summit of Caucasus; the _Tigrine Republic_ is established; the\r\n  _Cis_ and _Trans-Euphratean Conventions_ are assembled; and soon\r\n  shall _Arabia_, under the mild influence of _French Principles_,\r\n  resume her ancient appellation, and be again denominated ‘the\r\n  HAPPY’.\r\n\r\n  “In the course of the next Decade I shall sail to the Canal which is\r\n  now cutting across the _Isthmus of Suez_. The Polytechnic School and\r\n  Corps of Geographical Engineers are employed in devising means for\r\n  conveying my heavy artillery across the great Desert. Soon shall\r\n  _India_ hail us as her Deliverers, and those proud islanders, the\r\n  _Tyrants of Calcutta_, fall before the _Heroes of Arcola_.\r\n\r\n  “The Members of the National Institute who accompanied the Squadron\r\n  to Egypt, have made a large collection of Antiquities for the use of\r\n  the Republic. Among the scattered remains of the Alexandrine\r\n  Library, they have found a curious Treatise, in Arabic, respecting\r\n  _Camels_, from which it appears that Human Beings, by proper\r\n  treatment, may, like those useful animals, be trained to support\r\n  thirst and hunger without complaining. Many reams of papyrus have\r\n  been collected, as it is thought that during the present scarcity of\r\n  linen and old rags in France, it may answer all the purposes of\r\n  paper. CLEOPATRA’S celebrated Obelisk has been shipped on board the\r\n  Admiral’s Ship _L’Orient_, cidevant _Sans Culottes_: Another\r\n  man-of-war has been freighted with the _Sphinx_, which our Engineers\r\n  removed from _Grand Cairo_, and which, I trust, will be thought a\r\n  proper ornament for the Hall of Audience of the Directory.—The cage\r\n  in which BAJAZET was confined, has been long preserved at _Bassora_;\r\n  it will be transmitted to Paris as a proper model for a new _Cayenne\r\n  Diligence_.—I beg leave to present to the Director MERLIN, a very\r\n  curious book, bound in Morocco leather, from Algiers. It is finely\r\n  illuminated with gold; and contains lists of the various fees\r\n  usually received by Deys and their Ministers from Foreign\r\n  Ambassadors. A broken Column will be sent from _Carthage_. It\r\n  records the downfall of that Commercial City; and is sufficiently\r\n  large for an Inscription (if the Directory should think proper to\r\n  place it on the Banks of the _Thames_), to inform posterity that it\r\n  marks the spot where _London once stood_.\r\n\r\n                                                  “Health and Respect,\r\n                                                  “BUONAPARTÉ.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               No. XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                           July 2, 1798.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ODE TO A JACOBIN.\r\n                    FROM SUCKLING’S ODE TO A LOVER.\r\n\r\n                                       I.\r\n\r\n               UNCHRISTIAN JACOBIN whoever,\r\n               If, of thy God thou cherish ever\r\n               One wavering thought;

The ANTI-JACOBIN\r\nhas been conducted to the close of the Session in strict conformity with\r\nthe Principles upon which it was first undertaken.\r\n\r\nIts reception with the Public has been highly favourable:—it certainly\r\nhas been out of proportion to any merit which has appeared in the\r\nexecution of the Work. This is not said in the mere cant of Authorship.\r\nWe are sensible that much of our success has been owing to the improved\r\nstate of the Public mind;—an improvement existing from other causes, and\r\nto which, if We have in any degree contributed, it has in return\r\noperated to our advantage, by a reaction more than equal to any\r\nimpression which our exertions could have produced. There is, however,\r\none species of merit to which We lay claim without hesitation:—We mean\r\nthat of the Spirit and Principles upon which We have acted. That Spirit,\r\nWe trust We shall leave behind us. The SPELL of _Jacobin\r\ninvulnerability_ is now broken.[306]\r\n\r\nWe know from better authority than that of CAMILLE JORDAN, that one of\r\nour Daily Papers was, _early_ in the French Revolution, purchased by\r\nFrance, and devoted to the dissemination of tenets, which, at the period\r\nto which We allude, seemed necessary to the success of the Ruling Party.\r\n\r\nFor some time matters went on swimmingly. The Editors of the favoured\r\nPrints divided their time and their attention between _London_ and\r\n_Paris_; and the superiority of the governing Party in France, over its\r\nOpponents, was as duly, and as strenuously maintained in the English\r\nPapers, as in the “_Journal du Père de Chène_,”[307] “_Journal par L’Ami\r\ndu Peuple_,”[308] or any other Journal that issued from the Presses of\r\nthe Jacobin Society.\r\n\r\nAs the principles of the Revolution, however, acquired consistency in\r\nFrance, the struggle between the Governing Party and its Opponents\r\nbecame an object of less moment, and the Jacobins had leisure, as they\r\nlong had had inclination, to turn their views to this Country.\r\n\r\nA State, enjoying under a Government which they had proscribed as\r\nutterly incapable of producing either, as much freedom and happiness as\r\ncomport with the nature of Man, was too bitter a satire on the decision\r\nof these new SOLONS, to be regarded with patience; and the pens which\r\nhad been so industriously employed in celebrating the plunderers and\r\nperturbators of France, were now engaged in the benevolent design of\r\nrecommending their principles, and their plans of ameliorating the\r\ncondition of the human race by Atheism and Plunder, to the serious\r\nnotice of the People of _Great Britain_.\r\n\r\nAffairs seemed rapidly hastening to a crisis: _France_ saw with delight\r\nthe numbers seduced by the sophistry of her Writers, and by the alluring\r\nprospects of proscription and plunder; and her Agents, who snuffed the\r\nscent of blood like Vultures, already anticipated the Revolution which\r\nthey now believed inevitable; when the Ministry, who had viewed the\r\nprogress of the evil with an anxious but unterrified eye, roused\r\nthemselves into unexampled energy, and called on the Nation to rally\r\nround the Constitution which they had received from their Forefathers.\r\n\r\nThe call was gloriously answered;—Thousands and tens of thousands sprung\r\nforth in its defence; and the barbarous hordes which so lately\r\nthreatened its destruction, overawed by their numbers, shrunk from the\r\ncontest without a struggle, and vanished from the field.\r\n\r\nBut the nature of a Jacobin is restless. His hatred of all subordination\r\nis unbounded, and his thirst of plunder and blood urgent and insatiable.\r\nIn arms he found himself infinitely too weak to obtain his purpose; he\r\nmust, therefore, have recourse again to artifice; and by fallacies and\r\nlies, endeavoured to subvert and betray the judgment of those he could\r\nnot openly hope to subdue.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, the Press was engaged, and almost monopolized in all\r\nits branches: Reviews, Registers, Monthly Magazines, and Morning and\r\nEvening Prints, sprung forth in abundance.\r\n\r\nOf these last (the only Publications with which We have any immediate\r\nconcern), it is not too much to say, that they have laboured in the\r\ncause of infamy, with a perseverance which no sense of shame could\r\nrepress, and no dread of punishment overcome. The objects committed to\r\ntheir charge were multifarious. They were to revile all Religions, but\r\nparticularly the Christian, whose DIVINE FOUNDER was to be blasphemously\r\ncompared to _Bacchus_, and represented as equally ideal, or, if real,\r\nmore bestial and besotted! They were to magnify the power of _France_,\r\non all occasions; to deny her murders; to palliate her robberies; to\r\nsuppress all mention of her miseries, and to hold her forth to the\r\nunenlightened Englishman as the mirror of justice, and truth, and\r\ngenerosity, and meekness, and humanity, and moderation, and tender\r\nforbearance:—and, on the other hand, they were to depreciate the spirit,\r\nand the courage, and the resources of _England_: they were to impede, if\r\npossible, and if not, to ridicule and revile, every measure which the\r\nhonour, the prosperity, or the safety of the Country might imperiously\r\nrequire; they were to represent the Government as insidiously aiming to\r\nenslave the Nation, by every attempt to maintain its Independence; and\r\nthe majority of both Houses, the great body of Proprietors, as anxious\r\nto scatter and confound that wealth, which _their_ Patrons alone, the\r\nrespectable sweepings of _Craven-House_, and the _Crown_ and _Anchor_\r\nTavern, were solicitous to augment and preserve.\r\n\r\nThese, our readers will allow, were no common objects, and if they have\r\nlooked into the _Morning Chronicle_, _Morning Post_, and _Courier_\r\nJournals to which our attention has been chiefly directed, they must\r\nhave seen that their attainment was sought by no common means; by an\r\n_invariable_ course of Falsehood and Misrepresentation—such, at least,\r\nwas our idea on the first perusal of these Papers, an idea which every\r\nsucceeding one served to strengthen and confirm.\r\n\r\nTo detect and expose this Falsehood, and to correct this\r\nMisrepresentation, became at length an object of indispensable\r\nnecessity: a variety of applications of the most malignant nature had\r\nobtained currency and credit, from the unblushing impudence with which\r\nthey were first obtruded on the Public by the Agents of Sedition, and\r\nthe apathy with which they were suffered to pass uncontradicted by those\r\nwho despised them for their atrocity, or ridiculed them for their\r\nfolly:—these were unfortunately operating on the less enlightened part\r\nof the Nation; and it was from a full conviction of the pernicious\r\neffects they were calculated to produce, that we finally determined to\r\nstep forth (after patiently waiting to see whether the business would\r\nnot be taken up by abler hands), and to oppose such antidotes to the\r\nevil, as a regard for truth, and a sincere love and veneration for the\r\nConstitution under which we have flourished for ages, could supply.\r\n\r\nHow we have succeeded must be left to the judgment of the Public. If we\r\nmight venture, indeed, to conjecture from the support which we have\r\nexperienced, the result would be flattering in an unusual degree. Three\r\ncomplete Editions of our Paper (a circumstance, we believe, as yet\r\nwithout a precedent) have been disposed of, and the demand for them\r\nstill increases.\r\n\r\nBut the motives of Profit, as will readily, we believe, be granted to\r\nus, have little influence on our minds: we contemplate the extensive\r\ncirculation of our Paper with pleasure, solely from the consideration of\r\nthe VAST NUMBERS of our Countrymen whom we have fortified by our\r\nanimadversions against the profligate attacks of the Agents of Sedition,\r\nwhether furnished by the _Whig Club_, the _Corresponding Society_, or\r\nthe _Directory of France_.\r\n\r\nCalculation was not originally our delight. Nor was it till after we saw\r\nthe wonderful effects which it produced in the pages of the Jacobinical\r\nArithmeticians that we were tempted to adopt it. Our first Essay,\r\nhowever, was crowned with the most complete success. In our Seventh\r\nNumber, we gave (still following the laudable example of the Jacobins,\r\nwho, when a Ship is to be fitted out, or a Regiment raised, for the\r\npurpose of defending our Country from an insolent and barbarous foe,\r\nnicely calculate how many idle mouths might be fed by the sums\r\nrequired)—We gave, we say, as accurate a statement as we could form, of\r\nthe number of People that might be supplied with wholesome food for one\r\nday, by the SURCHARGE levied on the DUKE OF BEDFORD—a statement which,\r\nwe are happy to add, placed the matter in so clear a light that we have\r\nsince had no occasion to repeat it.\r\n\r\nOur Readers will not _now_ be surprised if we again have recourse to\r\n_Calculation_ to prove the advantages which (we love to flatter\r\nourselves) have been derived from our Paper. Our Sale (to say nothing of\r\nthe new Editions which have been disposed of) has regularly amounted to\r\n_Two Thousand Five Hundred_ a week; on an average of several Papers, we\r\nfind the Lies which have been detected to amount to _six_, and the\r\nMisrepresentations and Mistakes to _an equal number_. This furnishes a\r\ntotal of _twelve_, which, multiplied by _thirty-five_, the number of the\r\nlast ANTI-JACOBIN, gives a total of _four hundred and twenty_.\r\n\r\nIf we now take the number of Subscribers (2500) and multiply them by\r\nseven, a number of which every one’s family may be reasonably supposed\r\nto consist, we shall have a product of 17,500; but as many of these have\r\nmade a practice, which we highly approve, and cannot too earnestly\r\nrecommend, of lending our Papers to their poorer Neighbours, We must\r\nmake our addition to the sum which We evidently take too low at 32,500.\r\nWe have thus an aggregate of 50,000 People, a most respectable minority\r\nof the Readers of the whole Kingdom, who have been put effectually on\r\ntheir guard, by our humble though earnest endeavours, against the\r\nartifices of the seditious, and the more open attacks of the profligate\r\nand abandoned Foes of their Constitution, their Country, and their God.\r\n\r\nFurther, if we multiply 50,000, the number of Readers, by 420, the exact\r\nnumber of Falsehoods detected—say 500—for We ought to take in bye-blows,\r\nand odd refutations in notes, &c.—the total of Twenty-five Millions will\r\nrepresent the aggregate of Falsehood which We have sent out of the\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nWe have more than once repeated that we entered upon this part of our\r\ntask, not from any vain hope of convincing the Writers themselves. We\r\nknew this to be impossible; the forehead of a _Jacobin_, like the shield\r\nof AJAX, is formed of seven bull-hides, and utterly incapable of any\r\nimpression of shame or remorse—but we are convinced that we have\r\nrescued, as we stated above, Fifty Thousand persons from their\r\nmachinations, and taught them not only a salutary distrust, but a\r\ncontempt and disbelief, of every laboured article which appears in the\r\nPapers of this description.\r\n\r\nNor can We be accused of presumption in this declaration, when it is\r\nconsidered that the conviction on which We so confidently rely is not\r\nthe effect of a _solitary_ impression on our Readers’ minds, but of one\r\nfour hundred and twenty times repeated (this being the fair amount of\r\nthe number of Lies, &c., We have detected)—an agglomeration of impulse\r\nwhich no prejudice could resist and no preconceived partialities weaken\r\nor remove.\r\n\r\nHere then We rest. We trust We have “done the State some service”;—We\r\nhave driven the Jacobins from many strongholds to which they most\r\ntenaciously held.[309] We have exposed their Principles, detected their\r\nMotives, weakened their Authority, and overthrown their Credit. We have\r\nshewn them in every instance, ignorant, and designing, and false, and\r\nwicked, and turbulent, and anarchical—various in their language, but\r\nunited in their plans, and steadily pursuing through hatred and\r\ncontempt, the destruction of their Country.\r\n\r\nWith this impression on the Minds of our Readers WE TAKE OUR LEAVE of\r\nthem. Their welfare is in their own hands; if they suffer the Jacobins\r\nto regain any of the influence of which We have deprived them, they will\r\ncompromise their own Safety; but WE shall be blameless—_Liberavimus\r\nanimas nostras_.—WE HAVE DONE OUR DUTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                POETRY.\r\n\r\n                            _New Morality._\r\n\r\n From mental mists to purge a nation’s eyes;\r\n To animate the weak, unite the wise;\r\n To trace the deep infection that pervades\r\n The crowded town, and taints the rural shades;\r\n To mark how wide extends the mighty waste\r\n O’er the fair realms of Science, Learning, Taste;\r\n To drive and scatter all the brood of lies,\r\n And chase the varying falsehood as it flies;\r\n The long arrears of ridicule to pay,\r\n To drag reluctant dulness back to day;                                10\r\n Much yet remains.—To you these themes belong,\r\n Ye favoured sons of virtue and of song!\r\n\r\n   Say, is the field too narrow? are the times\r\n Barren of folly, and devoid of crimes?\r\n\r\n   Yet, venial vices, in a milder age,\r\n Could rouse the warmth of POPE’S satiric rage:\r\n The doating miser, and the lavish heir,\r\n The follies and the foibles of the fair,\r\n Sir Job, Sir Balaam, and old Euclio’s thrift,\r\n And Sappho’s diamonds with her dirty shift,                           20\r\n Blunt, Charteris, Hopkins,—meaner subjects fired\r\n The keen-eyed Poet; while the Muse inspired\r\n Her ardent child—entwining, as he sate,\r\n His laurel’d chaplet with the thorns of hate.\r\n\r\n   But say,—indignant does the Muse retire,\r\n Her shrine deserted, and extinct its fire?\r\n No pious hand to feed the sacred flame,\r\n No raptured soul a poet’s charge to claim?\r\n\r\n   Bethink thee, GIFFORD; when some future age\r\n Shall trace the promise of thy playful page;—                         30\r\n “[310]The hand which brushed a swarm of fools away\r\n Should rouse to grasp a more reluctant prey!”—\r\n Think then, will pleaded indolence excuse\r\n The tame secession of thy languid Muse?\r\n\r\n   Ah!

To repel this\r\nConquest, to ward off this ruin, various means are tried, according to\r\nthe power or the prudence of the different Nations. War, Treaty,\r\nSupplication, Bribery, timid Neutrality, implicit Submission, and,\r\nfinally, an Incorporation into the Map of the _Great Republic_, are all\r\nat this moment exemplified in the conduct of the Countries which\r\nsurround us.\r\n\r\nOur lot, a lot imposed upon us by necessity, but which if it were not so\r\nimposed upon us, whoever is not blind, judicially blind to the conduct\r\nof _France_ towards us, and every other Country, would claim by choice,\r\nis WAR.\r\n\r\nThe relation in which we may stand to the other States of Europe, or\r\nthey to each other, is comparatively of little moment. They may\r\nreciprocate Missions, and propose Treaties,—the _Ligurian Republic_ may\r\nmake Peace or War with the _Cisalpine_; the _Cisalpine_ with the\r\n_Roman_;—either of them with the KING of SARDINIA, with _Tuscany_, or\r\nwith _Naples_; and the greater Powers may mediate, or embroil the\r\nquarrel, may offer their protection, and talk of their Dignity:—But the\r\nquestion does not lie there.—_France_ has the power and the will to\r\ncontroul, to oppress them altogether; to limit or extend their\r\nBoundaries, as she sees good; to approve or annul their Internal\r\nRegulations, as well as their stipulations with each other: And while\r\nshe has that power, whether it be by strength in herself, or by the\r\nsufferance of others; whether she may choose to vex and harass them in\r\nmass, or detail; to keep peace between them, or to set them at variance;\r\nto work their revolutions by her own arms, or to delegate that sacred\r\noffice to their neighbours; or, finally, to insist upon their performing\r\nit each for themselves;—the result to us is the same. The People of\r\nEurope are equally enslaved;—it matters not whether they are manacled\r\nseparately, or bolted to the links of a long chain which connects and\r\ncoerces them in a fellowship of misery.\r\n\r\n                               _Mortalia corda\r\n                   Per gentes humilis stravit pavor._\r\n\r\nTo Us, the relation of these unhappy Powers, is either that of Friends\r\nforced into a Foreign Army to fight against us, or placed, hand-cuffed,\r\non the Deck of a Line of Battle Ship to receive our fire—or it is that\r\nof a Captive languishing in a Dungeon against which We are making an\r\nattack, and who does not dare to acknowledge his Friend, till he can\r\nhail him as his Deliverer.\r\n\r\nThe Contest between _Great Britain_ and _France_, then, is not for the\r\nexistence of the former only, but for the Freedom of the World. To look\r\nto partial Interests, to talk of partial Successes, as bearing upon the\r\nmain object and general issue of the War, is to take a narrow and\r\npitiful view of the most momentous and most tremendous subject that ever\r\nwas brought under the consideration of mankind.\r\n\r\nIf _Great Britain_, insensible of what she owes to herself and to the\r\nWorld, flinches (for she _cannot fall_), in the Contest;—she throws away\r\nnot herself alone, but the peace and happiness of Nations. If she\r\nmaintain herself stoutly;—to speculate on the mode, the time, the means\r\nby which success adequate to the immensity of the object at stake is to\r\nbe attained, were, indeed, presumptuous;—but We risk, without\r\napprehension of being thought sanguine in our hopes and expectations, or\r\nof being contradicted by the event, the sentiment of the greatest Orator\r\nof ancient times—“It is not, it cannot be possible, that an Empire\r\nfounded on injustice, on rapacity, on perfidy, on the contempt and\r\ndisregard of everything sacred towards God, or among Men;—it is not\r\npossible that such an Empire should endure.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        NOTES TO “NEW MORALITY”.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  JOSEPH PRIESTLEY, LL.D. (page 278).\r\n\r\n“I have read a communication from GEORGE III. to one of his ministers,\r\non the subject of the riots in which PRIESTLEY’S house was burned. HIS\r\nMAJESTY says, in his short emphatic way, that the riots must be stopped\r\n_immediately_; that no man’s house must be left in peril; and then he\r\norders the march of certain troops, &c., to restore peace; and concludes\r\nwith saying that, as the mischief did occur, it was impossible not to be\r\npleased at its having fallen on PRIESTLEY rather than another, that he\r\nmight _feel_ the wickedness of the doctrines of democracy which he was\r\npropagating.”—_J. W. Croker_ (_MS._).—[ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      MADAME DE STAEL (page 282).\r\n\r\n“MADAME DE STAEL was at Mickleham, in Surrey, in 1793, with Talleyrand,\r\nNarbonne, Jaucourt, Guibert (who proposed to her), and others. There was\r\nnot a little scandal about her relations with Narbonne (see Fanny\r\nBurney’s Letters). Narbonne’s place was supplied by Benjamin Constant,\r\nwho had a very great influence over her, as in return she had over him.\r\nAt Coppet, she found consolation in a young officer of Swiss origin,\r\nnamed Rocca, twenty-three years her junior, whom she married privately\r\nin 1811. She had married Baron de Stael in 1786, and in 1797 they\r\nseparated. He died in 1802; and she in 1817.”—_Life of Mad. de Stael, by\r\nA. Stevens_, 1880.\r\n\r\n“On the 28th of January” (says Crabb Robinson in his _Diary_, 1804), “I\r\nfirst waited on MADAME DE STAEL. I was shown into her bedroom, for\r\nwhich, not knowing Parisian customs, I was unprepared. She was sitting,\r\nmost decorously, in her bed, and writing. She had her night-cap on, and\r\nher face was not made up for the day. It was by no means a captivating\r\nspectacle, but I had a very cordial reception, and two bright black eyes\r\nsmiled benignantly on me. After a warm expression of her pleasure at\r\nmaking my acquaintance, she dismissed me till three o’clock. On my\r\nreturn then I found a very different person——the accomplished\r\nFrenchwoman surrounded by admirers, some of whom were themselves\r\ndistinguished. Among them was the aged WIELAND. There was on this, and,\r\nI believe, on almost every other, occasion, but one lady among the\r\nguests: in this instance FRAU VON KALB. MADAME DE STAEL did not affect\r\nto conceal her preference for the society of men to that of her own\r\nsex.”\r\n\r\nCOUNT D’ORSAY related of MADAME DE STAEL, whose character was discussed,\r\nthat one day, being on a sofa with MADAME DE RÉCAMIER, one who placed\r\nhimself between them exclaimed: “Me voilà entre la beauté et l’esprit!”\r\nShe replied: “That is the first time I was ever complimented for\r\nbeauty!” MADAME DE RÉCAMIER was thought the handsomest woman in Paris,\r\nbut was by no means famed for _esprit_.—_Crabb Robinson’s Diary._\r\n\r\n“MADAME DE STAEL was a perfect aristocrat, and her sympathies were\r\nwholly with the great and prosperous. She saw nothing in England but the\r\nluxury, stupidity, and pride of the Tory aristocracy, and the\r\nintelligence and magnificence of the Whig aristocracy. The latter talked\r\nabout truth and liberty and herself, and she supposed it was all as it\r\nshould be. As to the millions, the people, she never enquired into their\r\nsituation. She had a horror of the _canaille_, but anything of _sangre\r\nazul_ had a charm for her. When she was dying she said; ‘Let me die in\r\npeace; let my last moments be undisturbed’. Yet she ordered the cards of\r\nevery visitor to be brought to her. Among them was one from the DUC DE\r\nRICHELIEU. ‘What!’ exclaimed she, indignantly; ‘what! have you sent away\r\nthe DUKE? Hurry. Fly after him. Bring him back. Tell him that though I\r\ndie for all the world, I live for _him_.’”—_Bowring’s Autobr.\r\nRecollections_, pp. 375–6.\r\n\r\nMADAME DE STAEL prepared her _bons-mots_ with elaborate care, some being\r\nborrowed.... She was ugly, and not of an intellectual ugliness. Her\r\nfeatures were coarse, and the ordinary expression rather vulgar. She had\r\nan ugly mouth, and one or two irregularly prominent teeth, which perhaps\r\ngave her countenance an habitual gaiety. Her eye was full, dark, and\r\nexpressive; and when she declaimed, which was almost whenever she spoke,\r\nshe looked eloquent, and one forgot that she was plain. On the whole,\r\nshe was singularly unfeminine; and if, in conversation, one forgot she\r\nwas ugly, one forgot also that she was a woman.—_J. W. Croker’s\r\nNote-Books._—[ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                 THE REV. GILBERT WAKEFIELD (page 284).\r\n\r\n“It is well known that the French Revolution turned the brains of many\r\nof the noblest youths in England. Indeed when such men as COLERIDGE,\r\nWORDSWORTH, SOUTHEY, caught the infection, no wonder that those who\r\npartook of their sensibility, but had a very small portion of their\r\nintellect, were carried away. Many were ruined by the errors into which\r\nthey were betrayed; many also lived to smile at the follies of their\r\nyouth. ‘I am no more ashamed of having been a Republican,’ said SOUTHEY,\r\n‘than I am of having been a child.’ The opinions held led to many\r\npolitical prosecutions, and I naturally had much sympathy with the\r\nsufferers. I find in my journal, Feb. 21, 1799 (says Crabb Robinson):\r\n‘An interesting and memorable day. It was the day on which GILBERT\r\nWAKEFIELD was convicted of a seditious libel, and sentenced to two\r\nyears’ imprisonment. This he suffered in Dorchester Gaol, which he left\r\nonly to die. Originally of the Established Church, he became a\r\nUnitarian, and Professor at the Hackney College. By profession he was a\r\nscholar. His best known work was an edition of Lucretius. He had written\r\nagainst PORSON’S edition of the _Hecuba_ of Euripides.’ It is said that\r\nPORSON was at a dinner-party at which toasts were going round, and a\r\nname, accompanied by an appropriate sentence from Shakespeare, was\r\nrequired from each of the guests in succession. Before PORSON’S turn\r\ncame, he had disappeared beneath the table, and was supposed to be\r\ninsensible to what was going on. This, however, was not the case, for\r\nwhen a toast was required of him, he staggered up and gave: ‘Gilbert\r\nWakefield—what’s _Hecuba_ to him, or he to _Hecuba_?’ WAKEFIELD was a\r\npolitical fanatic. He had the pale complexion and mild features of a\r\nSaint, was a most gentle creature in domestic life, and a very amiable\r\nman; but when he took part in any religious or political controversy,\r\nhis pen was dipped in gall. The occasion of the imprisonment before\r\nalluded to was a letter in reply to WATSON, Bishop of Llandaff, who had\r\nwritten a pamphlet exhorting the people to loyalty. WAKEFIELD asserted\r\nthat the poor, the labouring classes; could lose nothing by French\r\nconquest. Referring to the fable of the Ass and the Trumpeter, he said:\r\n‘Will the enemy make me carry two panniers?’ and declared that, if the\r\nFrench came, they would find him at his post with the illustrious\r\ndead.”—[ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       JOHN THELWALL (page 284).\r\n\r\n“COLERIDGE and SOUTHEY spoke of THELWALL, calling him merely ‘John’:\r\nSOUTHEY said: ‘He is a good-hearted man; besides we ought never to\r\nforget that he was once as near as possible being hanged, as there is\r\nsome merit in _that_’.”—_Crabb Robinson’s Diary._—[ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                      JEAN PAUL MARAT (page 284).\r\n\r\nThe following remarkable account of this scientific monster is given in\r\nan “Historical Account of the Warrington Academy, an institution in\r\nLancashire,” published in the _Monthly Repository_, by the Rev. W.\r\nTurner, of Wakefield.\r\n\r\n“After the departure of DR. REINHOLD FORSTER, various unsuccessful\r\nattempts were made to engage a foreigner in the capacity of teacher of\r\nthe modern languages—a M. FANTIN LA TOUR, a M. LE MAITRE, _alias_ MARA,\r\nand a MR. LEWIS GUERY; but none of them continued for any length of\r\ntime.... There is great reason to believe that LE MAITRE, _alias_ MARA,\r\nwas the infamous MARAT.... It is known that he was in England about this\r\ntime [1774], and published in London “A Philosophical Essay on the\r\nconnection between the Body and the Soul of Man,” and, somewhere in the\r\ncountry, had a principal hand in printing, in quarto, a work of\r\nconsiderable ability, but of a seditious tendency, entitled—‘_The Chains\r\nof Slavery: a work wherein the clandestine and villainous Attempts of\r\nPrinces to ruin Liberty are pointed out, and the dreadful Scenes of\r\nDespotism disclosed, etc.; London, sold by J. Almon.... T. Payne, and\r\nRichardson and Urquhart, 1774._’ MARA, as his name is spelt in the\r\nMinutes of the Academy, very soon left Warrington, whence he went to\r\nOxford, robbed the Ashmolean Museum, escaped to Ireland, was apprehended\r\nin Dublin, tried and convicted in Oxford, under the name of LE MAITRE,\r\nand sentenced to the hulks at Woolwich. Here one of his old pupils at\r\nWarrington, a native of Bristol, saw him. He was afterwards a Bookseller\r\nin Bristol, and failed; was confined in the gaol of that city, but\r\nreleased by the Society there for the relief of prisoners confined for\r\nsmall sums. One of that society, who had previously relieved him in\r\nBristol Gaol, afterwards saw him in the National Assembly in Paris in\r\n1792.”\r\n\r\nGrave doubts have, however, been thrown upon the accuracy of the above\r\nstatement by HENRY A. BRIGHT, B.A., in a paper published in the\r\n_Transactions of the Historic Society of Lancashire and Cheshire_, 8vo,\r\nvol. xi., session 1858–9. Yet it was an establishment that might have\r\nattracted such a mind as Marat’s. “At WARRINGTON ACADEMY (says Mr.\r\nBright), were collected some of the noblest _literati_ of their day.\r\nHere the free thought of the English Presbyterians first began to\r\ncrystallize into the Unitarian theology which they have since\r\nmaintained. Here, for a time, was the centre of the liberal politics and\r\nthe literary taste of the entire county.... The Academy was founded in\r\n1757, and was closed in 1786. It was visited by John Howard, W. Roscoe,\r\nT. Pennant, Currie, the biographer of Burns, &c. The first Tutors\r\nappointed were DR. JOHN TAYLOR of Norwich, Tutor in Divinity, MR. HOLT\r\nof Kirkdale, Tutor in Natural Philosophy, MR. DYER of London, Tutor in\r\nLanguages and Polite Literature, whose duties, however, were taken by\r\nMR. (afterwards the REV. DR.) AIKIN, father of the celebrated Physician\r\nand Mrs. Barbauld. DR. PRIESTLEY succeeded DR. AIKIN.”\r\n\r\nDR. PRIESTLEY, who is addressed by COLERIDGE as “Patriot, and Saint, and\r\nSage,” was succeeded by JOHN REINHOLD FORSTER, a German Scholar and\r\nNaturalist, who accompanied Captain Cook in his second voyage, DR.\r\nENFIELD, author of _The Speaker_, and the REV. GILBERT WAKEFIELD, were\r\nTutors. Among the students were MR. SERJEANT HEYWOOD; ARCHIBALD HAMILTON\r\nROWAN, the Irish rebel; the REV. H. MALTHUS; LORD ENNISMORE; SIR JAMES\r\nCARNEGIE of Southesk; MR. HENRY BEAUFOY, etc., all strong Whigs. The\r\nname of neither MARA nor LE MAITRE appears on the Minutes of the\r\nAcademy.\r\n\r\nFor the latest contribution to the history of MARAT’S sojourn in England\r\nwe are indebted to the researches of MR. H. MORSE STEPHENS, of Balliol\r\nCollege, Oxford, who, in his elaborate and painstaking _History of the\r\nFrench Revolution_ (1886), which includes facts unknown to Carlyle and\r\nearlier historians, gives the following account of that\r\n“arch-destroyer”; but, as he calls him, “a much maligned individual”:—\r\n\r\n“JEAN PAUL MARAT,” says he, “was born at Boudry, near Neufchatel, in\r\nSwitzerland, on April 13, 1742. His father, who spelt his name ‘MARA,’\r\nwas a physician of some ability, and on being exiled from his native\r\nisland of Sardinia for abandoning the Roman Catholic religion, had taken\r\nup his residence in Switzerland; and married a Swiss Protestant. JEAN\r\nPAUL was the eldest of three sons; his next brother settled down as a\r\nwatchmaker at Geneva, and his youngest brother entered the service of\r\nthe Empress Catherine, and distinguished himself in the Russian army\r\nunder the title of the Chevalier de Boudry. JEAN PAUL was from his\r\nchildhood of an intensely sensitive and excitable disposition, and also\r\nso quick at his books that he became a good classical scholar, and\r\nacquainted with most modern languages. As his chief taste, however,\r\nseemed to be for natural science, he was intended to follow his father’s\r\nprofession, and was, at the age of eighteen, sent to study medicine at\r\nthe University of Bordeaux. He there obtained a thorough knowledge of\r\nhis profession, but devoted himself particularly to the sciences of\r\noptics and electricity. From Bordeaux he went to Paris, where he\r\neffected a remarkable cure of a disease of the eyes, which had been\r\nabandoned as hopeless both by physicians and quacks, by means of\r\nelectricity. From Paris he went to Amsterdam, and, finally, to LONDON,\r\nwhere he set up in practice in _Church Street, Soho_, then one of the\r\nmost fashionable districts in London. He must soon have formed a good\r\npractice, for he stopped in London, with occasional visits to Dublin and\r\nEdinburgh, for ten years, and only left it to take up an appointment at\r\nthe French court. While in London he wrote his first book, and in 1772\r\nand 1773, he published the first two volumes of a philosophical and\r\nphysiological _Essay on Man_. The point he discussed was the old problem\r\nof the relation between body and mind, and he treated it in a very\r\ninteresting manner from the physiological point of view. He held some\r\nextraordinary theory about the existence of some fluid in the veins\r\nwhich acted on the mind; which, however, does not impair the interest of\r\nhis inquiries into the cause of dreams, or diminish the respect felt for\r\nhis wide reading and extensive knowledge both of ancient and modern\r\nphilosophical and medical authors. He shows a wide knowledge of Latin\r\nand Greek literature, and while writing in good English freely quotes\r\nFrench, German, Italian, and Spanish writers. In one part of his book he\r\ndeclared that it was ridiculous for any one to make psychical researches\r\nwithout having some knowledge of anatomy and physiology, and openly\r\nattacked HELVÉTIUS for despising scientific knowledge in his famous _De\r\nl’Esprit_. VOLTAIRE naturally took the side of HELVÉTIUS, and did the\r\nyoung author the honour of noticing, and very severely criticising, his\r\nbook. MARAT himself translated it into French, and published it at\r\nAmsterdam in 1775. His next work was of a political character. He had\r\ngot mixed up with some of the popular societies in England, which were\r\nstriving to obtain a thorough reform of the representation of the people\r\nin the House of Commons, and, in 1774, published a work, which he\r\nentitled THE CHAINS OF SLAVERY. In this book, which is partly historical\r\nand partly political, he begs the electors to take more care in the\r\nchoice of their representatives. It is written in a very declamatory\r\nstyle, and strikes the note of the responsibility of representatives to\r\ntheir constituents, which is the key-note of all his political ideas.\r\nThe book is published in quarto, and is printed on fine paper, so that\r\nit can hardly have been meant to appeal to the populace, but it,\r\nnevertheless, procured him the honorary membership of the popular\r\nsocieties of _Newcastle_ and other great northern cities. Subsequently\r\nhe again returned to his profession, and after publishing a medical\r\ntract in 1775, of which no copy is known to exist, he published _An\r\nInquiry into the Nature, Cause, and Cure of a singular Disease of the\r\nEyes_, in 1776. [See _Academy_ of September 23, 1882.] In this little\r\npamphlet there is no violent language; it describes the disease and the\r\ncases he had cured in perfectly simple language, and shows, at least,\r\nthat he was no mere quack, but a scientific physician. On June 30, 1775,\r\nhe had, while on a visit to _Scotland_, received the honorary degree of\r\nM.D. from the _University of St. Andrews_ for his eminence as a doctor,\r\nand had probably received similar compliments from other Universities,\r\nbecause, on June 24, 1777, JEAN PAUL MARAT, ‘médecin de plusieurs\r\nfacultés d’Angleterre,’ was appointed, for his good character and high\r\nreputation as a doctor, physician to the body-guard of the Comte\r\nd’Artois, with a salary of a thousand livres a year and allowances. To\r\ntake up this court appointment he moved to Paris, and soon acquired a\r\nlarge practice there, and the name of ‘physician of the incurables,’\r\nfrom the number of hopeless cases he was successful in treating. He also\r\nmoved in the best society about the court, and won the affections of the\r\n_Marquise de l’Aubespine_ for saving her life. For some reason or other,\r\nmost probably because he had obtained a competent fortune, and desired\r\nto satisfy his ambition, he resigned his court appointment in 1783, and\r\ndevoted himself to science. He had long observed the phenomena of Heat,\r\nLight, and Electricity, and in the course of the next five years\r\npublished the result of his experiments, and presented them to the\r\n_Academy of Sciences_. His hard work won him the friendship of BENJAMIN\r\nFRANKLIN, but the violence with which he attacked his adversaries, and\r\nhis audacity in doubting the conclusions of NEWTON, prevented him from\r\nobtaining a seat in the Academy of Sciences. When he recognised that\r\nthis hostility to himself prevented due recognition of his work, he\r\ndetermined to win the approbation of the Academy by concealing his name;\r\nand his translation of the _Optics_ of NEWTON, which was covered by the\r\nname of _M. de Beauzée_, and published in 1788, was at once crowned by\r\nthe very Academy which had rejected him.\r\n\r\n“His political work during these years was confined to a treatise, in\r\nimitation of BECCARIA, on the subject of Punishments. The approach of\r\nthe States-General, however, revived his political enthusiasm, and in\r\nthe March of 1789, when he believed himself to be dying, he published\r\nhis _Offrande à la Patrie_, which was followed in quick succession by a\r\nsupplement and other pamphlets. Of these, distinctly the most able is\r\nthe _Tableau des Vices de la Constitution Anglaise_, which he presented\r\nto the Assembly in September, 1789. In it he points out what he had\r\nlearnt in the popular societies of England, that the English people was\r\nby no means so well governed as it was supposed to be; that the\r\ninfluence of the king and the ministry was overwhelming through the\r\nextent of patronage, and that the rich there bought seats in the House\r\nof Commons as they bought estates.\r\n\r\n“MARAT then felt that he could not express himself frequently enough in\r\npamphlets, and on September 12 appeared the first number of a journal\r\nwritten entirely by himself, called the JOURNAL DU PEUPLE, which title\r\nwas changed to that of _Ami du Peuple_, or _The People’s Friend_, with\r\nthe fourth number.\r\n\r\n“To understand the man, it is necessary to get rid of preconceived\r\nideas. Suspicious and irritable, excitable and sensitive to an extreme,\r\nhe attacked everybody, and attacked them all with unaccustomed violence;\r\nbut with all this, he was in private life a highly educated gentleman.\r\nThe extent of his attainments appears from his numerous works, and it\r\nmust be remembered that he could not for years have been a fashionable\r\nphysician and held a court appointment without being perfectly polite\r\nand well-bred. His faults arose from his irritable and suspicious\r\nnature, and years of persecution made him half-insane towards the end of\r\nhis life; but in September, 1789, he was in perfect possession of his\r\nsenses, and the very popularity of his journal showed how congenial his\r\ngospel of suspicion was to the Parisians.”—[ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                       JEAN PAUL MARAT’S SISTER.\r\n\r\nThe Right Hon. J. W. Croker, in a letter to John Winter Jones, dated\r\n23rd October, 1854, says that COLIN, who had been Marat’s printer or\r\npublisher, “introduced him to Marat’s sister, who was as like her\r\nbrother, he said—and as from all pictures and busts I readily\r\nbelieved—as ‘_deux gouttes d’eau_’. She was very small, very ugly, very\r\nsharp, and a great politician. Her ostensible livelihood was making\r\nwatch-springs, but she told me she was pretty easy in her circumstances,\r\nand I either gathered from her, or saw cause to suspect, that she had\r\nsome secret charitable help.”—[ED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                    LARÉVEILLÈRE-LEPAUX (page 283).\r\n\r\nLARÉVEILLÈRE-LEPAUX left orders in his will that his _Memoirs_ were to\r\nbe printed and published. His heirs were not proud of the part the\r\nDIRECTOR had played, so, after complying with the terms of his will and\r\n_printing_ the _Memoirs_, they _destroyed the whole issue at once_; and\r\nthe only copy extant is the one which, in accordance with the law of\r\nFrance, was sent to the _Bibliothèque Nationale_ at Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE THEOPHILANTHROPISTS.\r\n\r\nThese (_Gr._ “Lovers of Gods and Men”) were a sect of _Deists_ which\r\nappeared in France amid the confusion and disorder of the first\r\nRevolution. While the State was indifferent to all forms of Religion,\r\nand the Republican Directory was afraid of the Christianity which\r\nprevailed in the Church, a felt consciousness of the necessity of some\r\nreligion led many to adopt a form of worship adapted to Natural\r\nReligion.\r\n\r\n“This Sect” (says SOUTHEY, in the _Quarterly Review_, vol. xxviii.)\r\n“began with more circumstances in their favour than ever occurred to\r\nfacilitate the establishment of a religion or of a sect. Many persons of\r\nconsiderable influence and reputation engaged in the project with zeal,\r\nand it was patronised by LA RÉVEILLÈRE LÊPAUX, one of the Directory....\r\nHis motives for putting himself at the head of the Theophilanthropists\r\nare said to have been twofold: if the scheme succeeded, he intended to\r\nbecome their High Priest; and he hated Christianity. Through his means\r\nthe Theophilanthropists obtained a decree from the Government giving\r\nthem a right of holding their meetings in the Churches, as national\r\nbuildings, which were open to any religion, but belonged to none.\r\n\r\n“Nearly twenty Churches in Paris were taken possession of; but by\r\noccupying so many, they injured themselves.... They took up too extended\r\na position, and had neither numbers nor means answerable to the scale\r\nupon which they set out.... Their _Service_ began at noon, and lasted\r\nabout an hour and a half. It was, they said, a worship for those who had\r\nno other, and a moral society for those who had. The _Ritual_ consisted\r\nof Prayers, Hymns original or selected from the best French Poets,\r\nreadings from their Manual, and Discourses. The _Hymns_ were, in\r\ngeneral, judicious, and set to good music, and the _Prayers_ well\r\ncomposed; but had their books been stript of all that they had borrowed\r\nfrom the Gospel, and from the works of Christian writers, they would\r\nhave been meagre indeed. In one part of the Service there was a short\r\npause, during which the congregation were expected to consider each in\r\nsilence what his own conduct had been since the last of these meetings.\r\nA basket of fruit or flowers, according to the season, was placed upon\r\nthe altar, as a mark of acknowledgment for the bounties of the Creator;\r\nand over the altar was the inscription, _Nous croyons à l’existence de\r\nDieu, et à l’immortalité de l’âme_.... LA RÉVEILLÈRE, in a speech at the\r\nInstitute, declaiming against Christianity, as being opposed to the\r\nliberty of mankind, expressed his wish that a form of religion were\r\nadopted, which should have only _a couple of articles_. He wished also\r\nfor a religion without priests; and this, it was pleasantly observed,\r\nwould be like a Directory without a Director.\r\n\r\n“This was the _Creed of the Theophilanthropists_. And on each side of\r\nit, the following sentences were inscribed in their temples, to take\r\nplace of the Decalogue:—\r\n\r\n “‘Adore God, cherish your fellow-creatures; render yourselves useful to\r\n    your\r\n     country.\r\n Good is whatever tends to preserve man, or to perfectionate him.\r\n Evil is whatever tends to destroy him, or to deteriorate him.\r\n Children, honour your fathers and mothers; obey them with affection,\r\n    solace\r\n     their old age. Fathers and mothers, instruct your children.\r\n Wives, behold in your husbands the heads of your houses. Husbands, love\r\n     your wives, and render yourselves mutually happy.’\r\n\r\n“At _Marriage_ the bride and bridegroom were to be coupled with ribands,\r\nor garlands of flowers, the ends of which were to be held on each side\r\nby the elders of their respective families. The Bride received a ring\r\nfrom her husband, and a medal of union from the head of the family.\r\nThere was a rite also for infants.... When a member _died_, the other\r\nmembers of the Society were invited to place a flower upon the urn, and\r\npray the Creator to receive the deceased into his bosom. The Decades and\r\nNational Holidays were observed by these Anti-Christians, and they had\r\nfour Holidays of their own, for Socrates, St. Vincent de Paule, Jean\r\nJacques Rousseau, and Washington,—oddly assorted names! Two of them,\r\nhowever, stand well together in this kalendar, for the one, who was a\r\nChristian, established the Foundling Hospital at Paris; and the other,\r\nwho was a sentimentalist, a philosopher, and a Theophilanthropist, sent\r\nhis own children to it....\r\n\r\n“LA RÉVEILLÈRE used to take praise to himself for having, in his\r\nDirectorial character, humbled the Pope and the great Turk. The\r\nAnti-Christian language of the Directory, and its persecution of the\r\nClergy, are imputed to him; so far his colleagues were willing to go\r\nwith him; but his zeal for Deism they regarded as ridiculous.... In the\r\nway of pecuniary aid, he could obtain little:—_beaucoup d’argent_ was\r\nwhat the Directory were accustomed to demand, not to give....\r\n\r\n“Their _Service_ at Paris was numerously attended while it was a new\r\nspectacle, and the subject of conversation; but more than two-thirds of\r\nthe persons thus assembled were idlers. But this concourse soon abated;\r\nthere was nothing attractive in the ceremonies, nothing to impose upon\r\nthe imagination or the senses. A propagandist reported from Montreuil\r\nthat the readings and orations had been heard by an audience _avide de\r\nmorale_, but he had observed with pain that the _matériel_ of the\r\nworship was not what it should have been.... It was got up at Bourges in\r\nbetter style; the orator there officiated in a white sash ornamented\r\nwith blue flowers, before an altar upon which an orange tree was placed:\r\nand at the _fête des époux_, the Theophilanthropists carried _two\r\npigeons_ in procession, as an emblem of conjugal tenderness, and placed\r\nthem upon the altar of the country!”\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[The literary association of LAMB with COLERIDGE and SOUTHEY [says SIR\r\nT. N. TALFOURD, in his life of LAMB,] drew upon him the hostility of the\r\nyoung scorners of _The Anti-Jacobin_, who, luxuriating in boyish pride\r\nand aristocratic patronage, tossed the arrows of their wit against all\r\ncharged with innovation, whether in politics or poetry, and cared little\r\nwhom they wounded. No one could be more innocent than LAMB of political\r\nheresy; no one more strongly opposed to new theories in morality—which\r\nhe always regarded with disgust. The very first number of _The\r\nAnti-Jacobin Review and Magazine_ [this was, however, a new work, by\r\ndifferent hands, but imbued with the same spirit as _The Anti-Jacobin_]\r\nwas adorned by a caricature of GILLRAY’S, in which COLERIDGE and SOUTHEY\r\nwere introduced with asses’ heads, and LLOYD and LAMB as toad and frog.\r\nIn the number of July, 1798 [of the original _Anti-Jacobin_] appeared\r\nthe well-known poem of _New Morality_, in which all the prominent\r\nobjects of the hatred of these champions of religion and order were\r\nintroduced as offering homage to LEPAUX, a French charlatan,—of whose\r\nexistence LAMB had never even heard. Not content with thus confounding\r\npersons of the most opposite opinions and the most various characters in\r\none common libel, the party returned to the charge in their number for\r\nSeptember [of _The Anti-Jacobin Review_], and denounced the young poets\r\nin a parody on the _Ode to the Passions_, under the title of _The\r\nAnarchists_. They are reprinted in the present volume.—ED.]\r\n\r\n[The cause of Coleridge, Southey, Lloyd, and Lamb, being thus satirized\r\nas persons of the same politics, was the conjoint publication of their\r\nworks. In the spring of 1796, COLERIDGE published vol. i. of his\r\n_Juvenile Poems_, including three Sonnets by LAMB; in May, 1797, there\r\nappeared a new edition, with many poems by LLOYD and LAMB. _The Fall of\r\nRobespierre_, an historic drama, was published Sept. 22, 1794: the first\r\nact written by COLERIDGE, the second and third by SOUTHEY. It is not\r\ndifficult to understand why COLERIDGE was so severely attacked by the\r\nGovernment writers. In 1795, at the early age of 23, he delivered, at\r\nBristol, some public lectures, reflecting in warm terms on the measures\r\nof PITT. Three of them were published at Bristol at the end of 1795—the\r\nfirst two together, with the title of _Conciones ad Populum_; the third\r\nas _The Plot Discovered_. The eloquent passage in conclusion of the\r\nfirst of these addresses was written by SOUTHEY. That he was considered\r\nby ministers a dangerous character is proved by his having been for some\r\nmonths watched by a Government spy while residing at Stowey, providing\r\nfor his scanty maintenance by writing verses for _The Morning Post_. It\r\nwas his fortune also to excite the ire of BUONAPARTE, by his\r\nanti-gallican writings in the same paper; and a benevolent intimation of\r\nhis danger by Baron von Humboldt and Cardinal Fesch alone prevented his\r\nbeing arrested while in Italy. (See p. 284.)\r\n\r\nSOUTHEY thus alludes to the attack upon him (by GILLRAY, in his famous\r\ncaricature), in a letter addressed to C. W. W. WYNN, dated Hereford,\r\nAugust 15, 1798:—“I have seen myself _Bedfordized_, and it has been a\r\nsubject of much amusement. HOLCROFT’S likeness is admirably preserved. I\r\nknow not what poor LAMB has done to be croaking there. What I think the\r\nworst part of _The Anti-Jacobin_ abuse is the lumping together men of\r\nsuch opposite principles; this was stupid. We should have all been\r\nwelcoming the _Director_, not the _Theophilanthrope_. The conductors of\r\n_The Anti-Jacobin_ will have much to answer for in thus inflaming the\r\nanimosities of this country. They are labouring to produce the deadly\r\nhatred of Irish faction; perhaps to produce the same end. Such an\r\naddress as you mention might probably be of great use; that I could\r\nassist you in it is less certain. I do not feel myself at all calculated\r\nfor anything that requires methodical reasoning; and though you and I\r\nshould agree in the main object of the pamphlet, our opinions are at\r\nroot different. The old systems of government, I think, must fall; but\r\nin this country the immediate danger is on the other hand,—from an\r\nunconstitutional and unlimited power. BURLEIGH saw how a Parliament\r\nmight be employed against the people, and MONTESQUIEU prophesied the\r\nfall of English liberty when the Legislature should become corrupt. You\r\nwill not agree with me in thinking his prophecy fulfilled. Violent men\r\nthere undoubtedly are among the democrats, as they are always called;\r\nbut is there any one among them whom the ministerialists will allow to\r\nbe moderate?” _The Anti-Jacobin_ certainly speaks the sentiments of\r\nGovernment.’—ED.]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n               WORDSWORTH, COLERIDGE, SOUTHEY (page 284).\r\n\r\n[“The passionate verdicts given, both _pro_ and _con_, in reference to\r\nWORDSWORTH, COLERIDGE, and SOUTHEY, may now be looked back upon with\r\nsome wonder, but all three had made themselves obnoxious to the charge\r\nof renegadism. WORDSWORTH had accepted the office of stamp-distributor\r\nfrom Lord Lonsdale; SOUTHEY, after attempting to suppress his\r\ndemagogical drama of _Wat Tyler_, became a violent Tory, bringing a hot\r\npartisanship into the ranks to which he fled; and COLERIDGE, a\r\nTom-Paineite in politics and a preaching Unitarian, ended by adopting\r\nall the doctrines of orthodoxy.”—_Sir John Bowring._—ED.]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                        EDMUND BURKE (page 286).\r\n\r\n“ADAIR told me a great many things about BURKE, and FOX, and\r\nFITZPATRICK, and all the eminent men of that time with whom he lived\r\nwhen he was young. He said ... that FITZPATRICK was the most agreeable\r\nof them all, but HARE the most brilliant. BURKE’S conversation was\r\ndelightful, so luminous and instructive. He was very passionate; and\r\nADAIR said that the first time he ever saw him he unluckily asked him\r\nsome question about the wild parts of Ireland, when BURKE broke out:\r\n‘You are a fool and a blockhead. There are no wild parts in\r\nIreland.’ ... There was an attempt to bring about a reconciliation\r\nbetween him and FOX, and a meeting for that purpose took place of all\r\nthe leading men, at Burlington House. BURKE was on the point of yielding\r\nwhen his son suddenly made his appearance unbidden, and, on being told\r\nwhat was going on, he said: ‘My father shall be no party to such a\r\ncompromise,’ took BURKE aside, and persuaded him to reject the\r\novertures. That son ADAIR described as the most disagreeable, violent,\r\nand wrong-headed of men, but the idol of his father, who used to say\r\nthat he united all his own talents and acquirements with those of FOX\r\nand everybody else, &c.”—See _The Greville Memoirs_, i. 136–7.—[ED.]\r\n\r\n[The following remarkable passage occurs in a pamphlet written by TOM\r\nPAINE, entitled: _Thomas Paine to the People of England, on the Invasion\r\nof England; Philadelphia, printed at the Temple of Reason Press, Arch\r\nStreet, 1804_.\r\n\r\n“The original plan, formed in the time of the Directory (but now much\r\nmore extensive) was to build one thousand boats, each sixty feet long,\r\nsixteen feet broad, to draw about two feet water, to carry a twenty-four\r\nor thirty-six pounder in the head and a field-piece in the stern, to be\r\nrun out as soon as they touched ground. Each boat was to carry a hundred\r\nmen, making in the whole one hundred thousand, and to row with twenty or\r\ntwenty-five oars on a side. Bonaparte was appointed to the command, and\r\nby an agreement between him and me, I was to accompany him, as the\r\nintention of the expedition was to give the people of England an\r\nopportunity of forming a government for themselves, and thereby bring\r\nabout peace.”—ED.]\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE COURIER.\r\n\r\nTHE COURIER, in the time of the war, was the great paper; it obtained a\r\nlarge circulation, and consequently exercised considerable influence. It\r\nwas started by JOHN PARRY in 1792, and he carried it on for some years\r\nwith tolerable success, till he was ruined in 1799 by a government\r\nprosecution for a libel on the Emperor of Russia. It was bought by\r\nDANIEL STUART, who left _The Morning Post_ for _The Courier_ in 1803.\r\nDuring three years, says he, at the time of the overthrow of BUONAPARTE,\r\n_The Courier_, by the able management of PETER STREET, who was editor\r\nand half-proprietor, sold steadily upwards of 8000 per day; during one\r\nfortnight it sold upwards of 10,000 daily. At the end of 1809, S. T.\r\nCOLERIDGE contributed to it some Essays on the Spaniards; and in 1811 he\r\nwrote for it on a salary. At this time the paper was much under\r\nministerial direction. From about the year 1818 till 1829 _The Courier_\r\nwas conducted by W. MUDFORD, with whom WILLIAM STEWART was a proprietor.\r\nAfter 1819 D. STUART took no interest in it, and parted with his last\r\nshare in it in 1822. After the year 1825, JAMES STUART, a Scotch\r\ngentleman of great talent and respectability—the same that unfortunately\r\nkilled SIR ALEXANDER BOSWELL in a duel, and was author of _Travels in\r\nthe United States_—became editor. True to his principles, he gave in\r\nthis capacity every support in his power to the Whig or Liberal party.\r\nHe was appointed by LORD MELBOURNE to the situation of Factory\r\nInspector, which he held till his death, at the age of 74, in 1849. When\r\nJAS. STUART obtained his factory appointment, SAM. LAMAN BLANCHARD\r\nbecame editor. The paper having become, like other evening papers, less\r\nprofitable than of old, the proprietors sold it to the party they had so\r\nlong opposed. It took Tory politics; LAMAN BLANCHARD, of course,\r\nresigned; and a few short years were sufficient to destroy a journal\r\nwhich had once been the most valuable newspaper property in England. Its\r\nlast number appeared 6th July, 1842.\r\n\r\nIt is a curious, but not creditable, circumstance that _The Courier_ was\r\nin the habit of re-printing, from year to year, without acknowledgment,\r\nthe able leading articles from _The Liverpool Courier_, written by the\r\nRev. Richard Watson, secretary to the Wesleyan Missionary Society, by\r\nwhom, in conjunction with his friend, Mr. Kaye, this newspaper was\r\nestablished upon loyal and constitutional principles.\r\n\r\n“_The Courier_, in 1814, was supplied by R. Peel, Lord Palmerston, and\r\nJ. W. Croker, with political squibs and lyrics, resembling in general\r\nfeatures _The Anti-Jacobin_ and _The Rolliad_. The verses are chiefly\r\nparodies of Moore’s _Irish Melodies_, or of Byron’s songs, and are far\r\nabove the ordinary level of such compositions.... The various pieces\r\nwere collected and published in 1815, under the title of _The New Whig\r\nGuide_.”—_Croker Papers_, vol. i., p. 58.\r\n\r\nThis statement contains several inaccuracies. The pieces forming _The\r\nNew Whig Guide_ were first collected and published in 1819, _and not in\r\n1815_, for BYRON’S _Fare thee well_ was not written till April, 1816.\r\nThe parody on it was entitled _The Leader’s Lament. By the Right Hon.\r\nGeorge Ponsonby_. A. Hayward says in his review of _The Poetry of the\r\nAnti-Jacobin_, in _The Edinburgh Review_, 1858—that “CANNING has been\r\ntraditionally credited with the parody of Moore’s. _Believe me, if all\r\nthose endearing young charms_, the gentleman addressed being a\r\ndistinguished commoner afterwards ennobled (the first LORD METHUEN), who\r\nwas far from meriting the character [of a foolish fop] thereby fastened\r\non him”. The other parodies were by JOHN CALCRAFT, the Hon. W. H.\r\nLYTTELTON, DUDLEY NORTH, M.P., KIRKMAN FINLAY, M.P. for Glasgow, &c. MR.\r\nMETHUEN, in return, wrote many clever squibs and parodies against the\r\nTories, which were collected, under the title of _The New Tory Guide_,\r\nand reproduced, like its rivals in 1819. “Talking of _The Morning\r\nChronicle_,” says T. MOORE (_Diary, 19th March, 1831_), “PAUL METHUEN\r\ntold us he was the author of almost all those about _The Rat Club_;\r\nwhich are certainly some of the best.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                               THE STAR.\r\n\r\nTHE STAR, the first London daily Evening Newspaper, was started in 1788\r\nby PETER STUART, brother to DANIEL STUART, of _The Morning Post_. Its\r\nfirst editor was ANDREW MACDONALD, author of _Vimonda_, a tragedy, and\r\nother works: and after him another Scottish poet, John Mayne, author of\r\n_The Siller Gun_, was editor. ROBERT BURNS was offered an engagement to\r\nwrite poetry for it, at the rate of one guinea an article per week. The\r\narrangement was not completed. It was to PETER STUART that BURNS\r\naddressed his “Poem, written to a gentleman who had sent him a\r\nNewspaper, and offered to continue it free of expense”. The facetious\r\nBob Allen, of whom Charles Lamb has such pleasant reminiscences, was for\r\nmany years a contributor to this paper. Subsequently, DR. A. TILLOCH,\r\neditor of _The Philosophical Magazine_, was for many years editor of\r\n_The Star_. After Oct. 15, 1831, _The Star_ became incorporated with\r\n_The Albion_ newspaper, under the title of _The Albion and Evening\r\nStar_.\r\n\r\n_The Star_ was during many years the leading newspaper on the Whig side,\r\nCAMPBELL the poet being one of its writers after 1804, when he was\r\nengaged at a salary of four guineas a week. The clear profits of this\r\npaper in 1820 were said, on apparently good authority, to amount to\r\n£6000.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE MORNING CHRONICLE.\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING CHRONICLE was, with one exception (_The Public Ledger_,\r\nwhich started in 1760), the oldest of the daily papers up to the period\r\nof its discontinuance March 19, 1862. The latest number in the British\r\nMuseum is dated Dec. 31, 1861.\r\n\r\nIt was established on Whig principles, 28th June, 1769, by WILLIAM\r\nWOODFALL, who carried it on with great success till 1789.\r\n\r\nWoodfall, in addition to other talents requisite to the success of a\r\nnewspaper, possessed two, which were of essential service to it, namely,\r\nhis prodigious memory, which enabled him to report Parliamentary Debates\r\nwithout the aid of notes, and the excellence of his Theatrical\r\nCriticisms, which, as MR. FOX BOURNE, in his copious and valuable work\r\non _English Newspapers_, 2 vols., 8vo., 1887—one to which the editor of\r\nthe present publication has been under frequent obligations—says, “are a\r\nneglected mine of wealth for students of Theatrical History”.\r\n\r\nOn WOODFALL’S death, in 1803, it was sold to JAMES PERRY, who borrowed\r\n£500 from RANSOME & CO., the bankers, and some more from BELLAMY, the\r\nwine merchant—who was also caterer and doorkeeper to the House of\r\nCommons—and entered into partnership with a Charterhouse schoolmaster\r\nnamed GRAY, who had just received a legacy of £500. With that joint\r\ncapital, the two bought _The Chronicle_, the DUKE OF NORFOLK making\r\nPERRY a present of a house in the Strand, which he converted into a new\r\npublishing office. A few other influential Whigs, also, contributed a\r\nfurther sum, which, as the late SIR ROBERT ADAIR, who is so often\r\nsatirized in _The Anti-Jacobin_, and who was a subscriber to the fund,\r\ninformed the editor of the present work, was £300.\r\n\r\nPERRY was on good terms with his contributors, and made _The Morning\r\nChronicle_ a more prosperous and influential journal than had ever\r\nbefore been known in England. GRAY provided the heavy articles, PERRY\r\nthose of lighter sort; and after GRAY’S death, which happened when he\r\nhad been part proprietor for only a few years, other writers were\r\nemployed, among them JAS. MACKINTOSH and SHERIDAN, and in later times T.\r\nCAMPBELL and T. MOORE, who contributed verse, and JOHN CAMPBELL, then a\r\nyoung barrister, who was the Theatrical Critic, and was still so in\r\n1810. T. CAMPBELL, on coming to London in 1802, was engaged as a\r\npolitical writer, but this not being his forte, he, with great judgment,\r\nconfined himself to poetical pieces, among which were _Ye Mariners of\r\nEngland_, and _The Exile of Erin_. PERRY had another and equally famous\r\ncontributor. In Sept., 1793, S. T. COLERIDGE, then aged nineteen, “sent\r\na poem of a few lines to PERRY, soliciting a loan of a guinea for a\r\ndistressed author,” which prayer was immediately granted. In 1796, he\r\naccepted an offer of Perry’s to write in it, but the arrangement was\r\nnever carried out. In later years, COLERIDGE wrote some other poems for\r\n_The Morning Chronicle_, and his friend CHARLES LAMB was an occasional\r\nwriter of prose for it.\r\n\r\nPERRY continued as the general manager of the paper till his death on\r\n6th Dec., 1821; but before this he had left much of the editing to\r\nothers, his first assistant after GRAY’S death being ROBERT SPANKIE,\r\nultimately attorney-general of Bengal. The next was JOHN BLACK, who had\r\njoined him in 1810; and upon him, when PERRY died, the entire management\r\ndevolved.\r\n\r\nAfter PERRY’S death the paper was purchased for £42,000, by WILLIAM\r\nCLEMENT, by whom it was held till 1834, when it was sold to SIR JOHN\r\nEASTHOPE for £16,500.\r\n\r\nIn 1843, JOHN BLACK was dismissed to make way for ANDREW DOYLE, who had\r\nbeen Foreign Editor, and had married Sir John’s daughter. Black died in\r\n1855.\r\n\r\nOn 26th July, 1847, SIR JOHN EASTHOPE, who had been carrying on the\r\npaper at a loss for some time, sold it to the Duke of Newcastle, W. E.\r\nGladstone, Sidney Herbert, and other influential Peelites. Its new\r\nEditor was JOHN DOUGLAS COOK, who had for some time been one of the\r\nreporters of _The Times_, and who gathered round him a brilliant staff\r\nof contributors, including George Sydney Smythe, afterwards Lord\r\nStrangford, Gilbert Venables, Abraham Hayward, William Vernon Harcourt,\r\nand Thackeray. Its business manager was WILLIAM DELANE, the father of\r\nthe clever young editor of _The Times_, JOHN THADDEUS DELANE.\r\n\r\n_The Chronicle_ lingered on as a would-be Peelite organ till the autumn\r\nof 1854, when by a curious arrangement, the paper, with all its plant,\r\nwas sold to Serjeant GLOVER, for £7500, on the understanding that, if he\r\ncontinued to support in it the Peelite policy, he should have the money\r\nback with interest, being paid £3000 a year for three years. That\r\ncontract soon fell through, as GLOVER preferred to draw a subsidy from\r\nLOUIS NAPOLEON, and to make other experiments. At the close of 1854, the\r\ncirculation of _The Morning Chronicle_ averaged only about 2500, while\r\nthat of _The Morning Post_ was about 3000, that of _The Morning Herald_\r\nabout 3500, that of _The Daily News_ about 5300, that of _The Morning\r\nAdvertiser_ about 6600, and that of _The Times_ about 55,000.\r\n\r\nThe last number of _The Morning Chronicle_ appeared March 19, 1862, when\r\nwhat at one time had been the most influential journal in the country\r\naltogether ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nOf this paper SHERIDAN speaks in _The Critic_, and to it BYRON addressed\r\na _Familiar Epistle_. For its columns W. HAZLITT wrote some of the\r\nfinest criticisms in our own or any other language. Some of the early\r\n_Sketches by Boz_ appeared in it, but they were really commenced in the\r\nold _Monthly Magazine_. DICKENS’S father was one of the staff. HAZLITT\r\nalso contributed to it Parliamentary Reports, as at a later period did\r\nC. DICKENS.\r\n\r\nAmong other distinguished writers in _The Morning Chronicle_ were Lord\r\nBrougham, the Duke of Sussex, David Ricardo, Cyrus Redding, Albany\r\nFonblanque, James and John Stuart Mill, John Payne Collier, Eyre Evans\r\nCrowe, Charles Buller, Lord Holland, Joseph Parkes, Michael Joseph Quin,\r\nGeorge Hogarth, James Fraser, W. Hazlitt, secundus, Lord Melbourne, W.\r\nJohnson Fox, Henry Mayhew, Lord Palmerston, A. B. Reach, Alex. and\r\nCharles Mackay, Tom Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           THE MORNING POST.\r\n\r\nTHE MORNING POST, the next _daily_ paper in order of date to _The\r\nChronicle_, first appeared in 1772, and was probably projected by JOHN\r\nBELL. Three years subsequently the REV. HENRY BATE (who took in 1784 the\r\nname of Dudley, and was created a baronet in 1816) joined it, and was\r\nconnected with it till the end of 1780, when he quarrelled with his\r\ncolleagues, and set up _The Morning Herald_, the first number of which\r\nappeared on Nov. 1 in the same year. In June, 1781, he was sentenced to\r\na year’s imprisonment for an atrocious libel on the Duke of Richmond. He\r\nwas (says Horace Walpole, in his _Journal of the Reign of George III._),\r\nthe worst of all the scandalous libellers that had appeared, both on\r\nprivate persons as well as public. His life was dissolute, and he had\r\nfought more than one duel. Yet Lord Sandwich had procured for him a good\r\nCrown living, and he was believed to be pensioned by the Court. He died\r\nin 1824.\r\n\r\nAfter BATE, as editor, came the REV. W. JACKMAN (or JACKSON)—an equally\r\ndiscreditable clergyman,—and he was succeeded by JOHN TAYLOR (author of\r\n_Monsieur Tonson_), for whom PETER PINDAR (DR. JOHN WOLCOT) wrote\r\nwhimsical verses.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, MR. TATTERSALL was the responsible proprietor, who, knowing\r\nmore about horses and sport than about the elegancies of literature, DR.\r\nWOLCOT continued to be the chief writer; and who, besides his clever\r\nverses, gave much information upon affairs of the prize-ring and kindred\r\namusements. In 1795, TATTERSALL sold the entire copyright, with house\r\nand printing materials, for £600. The circulation then was only 350\r\ndaily.\r\n\r\nThe purchaser was MR. DANIEL STUART; and MR. CHRISTIE, the auctioneer,\r\nwas also a proprietor. Previous to this time, ROBERT BURNS was applied\r\nto, to supply poetry, but none was ever sent. DANIEL STUART was not\r\ntwenty-nine when he bought _The Morning Post_; and JAMES (afterwards SIR\r\nJAS.) MACKINTOSH, who was his brother-in-law, and was a regular\r\ncontributor, was his senior only by a year.\r\n\r\nAfter 1790, the same ANDREW MACDONALD, who had been editor of _The\r\nStar_, furnished poems, as did WORDSWORTH, SOUTHEY, C. LLOYD, and other\r\nverse writers. At the commencement of 1798, S. T. COLERIDGE—then only\r\ntwenty-five—was engaged to contribute poetry. The Odes, _Fire, Famine,\r\nand Slaughter_; _France_; _Dejection_; and that on _The Departing Year_;\r\nwith twenty or thirty other pieces, since included in his Poetical\r\nWorks, among which was _Love_—one of the most popular poems of this\r\nage—were first published in _The Morning Post_. To these must be added\r\nthe first draught of _The Devil’s Thoughts_, a piece afterwards much\r\naltered. About 1800, the paper was supplied with some excellent pieces,\r\nin prose, including Fashionable Intelligence, short pungent articles,\r\nand jokes, by CHARLES LAMB.\r\n\r\nIn 1798 its sale was over 2000; and so well had DANIEL STUART managed\r\nhis property—being exceedingly well served by his principal assistant,\r\nGEORGE LANE—that when he left _The Morning Post_ for _The Courier_, in\r\n1803, the circulation amounted to 4,500. It, therefore, stood higher in\r\npoint of sale than any other morning paper, the order in respect of\r\nnumbers from high to low being this: _Morning Post_, _Morning Herald_,\r\n_Morning Advertiser_, _Times_. The amount received for it was about\r\n£25,000. According to JOHN TAYLOR, editor of _The Sun_, in his _Records\r\nof my Life_, _The Morning Post_ was afterwards purchased by Government\r\nto silence attacks on the PRINCE REGENT.\r\n\r\nMuch of the success of _The Morning Post_ was undoubtedly owing to the\r\nwritings of COLERIDGE. He afterwards declared that he had wasted the\r\nprime and manhood of his intellect in writing for _The Morning Post_ and\r\n_Courier_. Among his contributions to the former (March 19, 1800) was\r\nhis famous character of WILLIAM PITT. The last time he wrote in it was\r\nin August, 1802.\r\n\r\nA very competent judge, THOMAS DE QUINCEY, thus alludes to COLERIDGE’S\r\npolitical writings:—“Worlds of fine thinking,” he says of the daily\r\npress, “lie buried in that vast abyss, never to be disentombed, or\r\nrestored to human admiration. Like the sea, it has swallowed treasures\r\nwithout end, that no diving-bell will bring up again. But nowhere\r\nthroughout its shoreless magazines of wealth does there lie such a bed\r\nof pearls, confounded with the rubbish and ‘_purgamenta_’ of ages, as in\r\nthe political papers of COLERIDGE. No more appreciable monument could be\r\nraised to the memory of COLERIDGE, than a re-publication of his Essays\r\nin _The Morning Post_, but still more of those afterwards published in\r\n_The Courier_.” These have since been reprinted under the title of\r\n_Essays on his own Times_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE ANARCHISTS.—An Ode.\r\n\r\n              [A Parody on Collins’s Ode to the Passions.]\r\n\r\n             —Numero plures, virtute et honore minores,\r\n             Indocti stolidique et depugnare parati.—_Hor._\r\n\r\n    When Anarchy, sworn foe to Kings,\r\n    O’er Gallia wav’d her crimson wings,\r\n    Ere yet she spoil’d with iron hand\r\n    Fair Europe’s desolated land;\r\n    Her offspring here, a spurious brood,\r\n    In faction nurs’d, inur’d to blood,\r\n    Elate with Hope, perplex’d with Fear,\r\n    Would often raise the listening ear;\r\n    And all their mother’s wonders tell,\r\n    And throng around her secret cell,\r\n    Ranting, bribing, whispering, trembling,\r\n    Urging, boasting, and dissembling.\r\n    By turns they felt the Gallic mind\r\n    Enlarg’d, unprejudic’d, refin’d;\r\n    Till once, by all the goddess fir’d,\r\n    Beyond Discretion rapt, inspir’d;\r\n    Seditious, false, and prone to ill,\r\n    They eager snatch’d the grey-goose quill.\r\n    And as they oft had heard apart\r\n    The wonders of Sedition’s art,\r\n    Each, for Madness rul’d the hour,\r\n    Would prove his own subversive power.\r\n\r\n    First PAINE his _Rights of Man_ display’d,\r\n        But could no more—for falsely cross’d\r\n    Ev’n by the friends himself had made,\r\n        Enraged he fled to Gallia’s coast.\r\n    Next PRIESTLEY tried, to whom ’twas given\r\n        Mankind’s free-agency to tell;\r\n    Ordain’d to point the road to heaven,\r\n        In pure free will he points—to hell!\r\n    With meagre visage THELWALL came,\r\n        In lectures told his sufferings sore;\r\n    Till purple tyrants blush’d with shame\r\n        And crowds the suffering saint adore.\r\n    But thou, O GODWIN!

The Republican Judge, or the American Liberty of the Press,\r\n      as exhibited, explained, and exposed, in the base and partial\r\n      Prosecution of William Cobbett, for a pretended Libel against the\r\n      King of Spain and his Embassador, before the Supreme Court of\r\n      Pennsylvania. With an Address to the People of England._\r\n\r\n        _By Peter Porcupine. 8vo., pp. 96. Price 2s. Wright, London._\r\n\r\n  The past writings of Mr. William Cobbett, who has assumed the\r\n  appellation of Peter Porcupine, are too well known in England to\r\n  require any explanation from us, either of _their_ tendency, or of\r\n  the author’s principles. Were any doubt entertained on the subject,\r\n  nothing more would be requisite to dispel it than a mere reference\r\n  to the comments of all the Jacobin Reviewers; who have, without\r\n  exception, in defiance alike of decency and of truth, lavished on\r\n  them the most indiscriminate censure and the most scurrilous abuse.\r\n  Strange as it may appear, it is indisputably true that the\r\n  individual exertions of Mr. Cobbett have more essentially\r\n  contributed to give a proper tone to the public spirit in America\r\n  than all the efforts of the well-disposed part of the native\r\n  Americans: for a considerable length of time he combated alone a\r\n  host of foes, “himself a host”; stemmed the impetuous tide of\r\n  democracy; and checked the irruptions of French anarchy and atheism,\r\n  which threatened to overwhelm the American States, and, with the\r\n  ruins of their confliction, to crush everything for which the\r\n  Americans, at the period of their revolution, professed to fight,\r\n  and which they have ever since professed to cherish. The adoption of\r\n  such a line of conduct was alone sufficient to draw down upon our\r\n  author the vengeance of all whose treasonable designs his manly\r\n  efforts were intended to defeat. Accordingly, nothing was spared by\r\n  the infuriated advocates of anarchy to injure him in the public\r\n  mind, and, by blasting his reputation, to deprive him of that credit\r\n  which was indispensably necessary to secure the success of his\r\n  works. No imputation however base, no lie however atrocious, none of\r\n  those black and diabolical arts, in short, which, issuing from the\r\n  bubbling cauldron of democracy, were so skilfully employed to\r\n  blacken the first and fairest character in France, as a necessary\r\n  prelude to the establishment of the _virtuous_ republic of the Great\r\n  Nation, were neglected in the _glorious_ attempt to achieve the ruin\r\n  of this worthy individual. When these were found to fail of\r\n  producing the desired effect, recourse was had to personal\r\n  threats—the coward’s weapon—with the hope of inducing him, by the\r\n  means of intimidation, to quit a country in which his enemies\r\n  endeavoured to convince him that his life was daily exposed to most\r\n  imminent danger. But neither the dread of calumny, nor the fear of\r\n  assassination, could lead the object of their persecution to forego\r\n  his laudable design. He manfully persevered, and has at length,\r\n  though not without infinite difficulty, succeeded in opening the\r\n  eyes of the Americans to their own interest, and in the infamous\r\n  machinations of France, and of American traitors in the pay of\r\n  France—for England is not the ONLY country in which foreign gold is\r\n  employed as a stimulus to domestic treason.[330] In the course of\r\n  his exertions to produce this desirable end, honest Peter had\r\n  occasion to comment on the pusillanimous conduct of the Spanish\r\n  monarch, in bending the knee to, and forming an alliance with, the\r\n  base plunderers and assassins of his family, and on the insidious\r\n  and criminal efforts of the Spanish ambassador to strengthen the\r\n  hands of the French faction in America. These comments, it seems,\r\n  excited the indignation of Don Carlos Martinez de Trojo, who\r\n  determined to bring the author to condign punishment; and it was the\r\n  very unwarrantable conduct which the latter experienced on the\r\n  occasion that gave rise to the publication before us.\r\n\r\n  PETER begins his tract by stating the dangers to which he knew\r\n  himself exposed, on account of his political principles, when he\r\n  established his residence in the state of Pennsylvania, “where the\r\n  government, generally speaking, was in the hands of those who had\r\n  (and sometimes with great indecency) manifested an uniform\r\n  partiality for the sans-culotte French, and as uniform an opposition\r\n  to the ministers and measures of the federal government”. That men\r\n  should ever be placed in situations of trust and importance, whose\r\n  principles are avowedly adverse to the constitution whence they\r\n  derive their subsistence, and which it is their bounden duty to\r\n  protect, is a circumstance that would excite universal astonishment\r\n  if it did not, unhappily, so often occur. Still the frequency of its\r\n  occurrence does not alter its nature, nor should it be allowed to\r\n  diminish that ample portion of censure which must ever attach to the\r\n  authors of such appointments. It is such conduct as this that\r\n  justifies one of the wisest observations that ever fell from the pen\r\n  of Voltaire—“A GOVERNMENT CAN ONLY PERISH BY SUICIDE”—an observation\r\n  confirmed by the fate of every country that has been recently\r\n  reduced beneath the iron yoke of republican France.\r\n\r\n  Aware of his danger, our author thought the best means of averting\r\n  it was, by seeking for some standard, as a safe rule for his conduct\r\n  in respect to the liberty of this press. “The English press was said\r\n  to be _enslaved_; but, when I came to consult the practice of this\r\n  enslaved press, I found it still to be far too free for me to\r\n  attempt to follow its example. Finally, it appeared to me to be the\r\n  safest way, to form to myself some rule founded on the liberty\r\n  exercised by the _American press_. I concluded that I might without\r\n  danger go as great lengths in attacking the enemies of the country\r\n  as others went in attacking its friends: that as much zeal might be\r\n  shown in defending the general government and administration as in\r\n  accusing and traducing them: and that as great warmth would be\r\n  admissible in the cause of virtue, order, and religion, as had been\r\n  tolerated in the wicked cause of villainy, insurrection, and\r\n  blasphemy” (p. 21). Alas! Peter, at this time, knew but little of\r\n  the “spirit and temper,” as MR. BARRISTER ERSKINE would express it,\r\n  of democracy and Jacobinism. He knew not that the men who profess\r\n  those principles are for the most part vindictive, malignant,\r\n  oppressive, and intolerant; and that under the mask of liberty they\r\n  exercise the most insupportable tyranny over their families and\r\n  dependents, and that in their general conduct to their\r\n  inferiors—unless when impelled by interest or urged by ambition,\r\n  they irritate their passions with toasts and flattery, from a\r\n  tavern-chair, or influence their minds by seditious discourses and\r\n  treasonable insinuations, from a tribune or a scaffold—they are\r\n  supercilious, arrogant, insolent, and overbearing. He knew not, it\r\n  would seem, that those whose whole duty is to defend the laws often\r\n  _sleep on their posts_, while their enemies are ever vigilant,\r\n  active, and alert; that when the former are attacked, a tardiness of\r\n  zeal, amounting nearly to torpor, secures, with few exceptions,\r\n  impunity to the assailant; whereas any exposure of the latter draws\r\n  forth a malignity of revenge which is the certain fore-runner of\r\n  persecution. Indeed, the inveteracy of the discontented, of that\r\n  class which includes all those who aspire to the possession of place\r\n  and power, and are little scrupulous about the means of attaining\r\n  them; and all the determined revolutionists or subverters of\r\n  established institutions, may be traced to a natural source. Unable\r\n  to support by reason a cause which reason disavows, unable to\r\n  strengthen by arguments positions which set all argument at\r\n  defiance, it becomes their business to inflame by passion and to\r\n  dazzle with sophistry. Hence arises an extreme facility of exposing\r\n  their weakness and detecting their infamy, and not having the means\r\n  of resisting such exposure, being wholly destitute of the sentiments\r\n  which are necessary for a successful reply, they are reduced to the\r\n  degrading alternative of abandoning the field to a triumphant\r\n  adversary, or of seeking, by the adoption of violent measures, to\r\n  punish the opponent whom they did not dare to encounter. This it is\r\n  that renders revenge an active principle in _their_ minds.\r\n\r\n  The first step taken by the Spanish ambassador was an application to\r\n  the federal government to prosecute our author “for certain matters\r\n  published in his Gazette against himself and that poor, unfortunate,\r\n  and humbled mortal, Charles IV., King of Spain”. The government\r\n  consented, and Peter was accordingly bound over to appear in the\r\n  federal district court before _Judge Peters_. Don Carlos, however,\r\n  soon found that his prosecution would be more likely to succeed, if\r\n  brought in a district where the defendant had more personal enemies,\r\n  and where the people were more generally disposed to the adoption of\r\n  revolutionary principles. A memorial was, accordingly, “delivered in\r\n  to the federal government, requesting that the trial might come on\r\n  before the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, of which Court _McKean is\r\n  Chief Justice_”. Of this _republican_ Judge our author gives such an\r\n  account as must convey to English minds a strange idea of the\r\n  administration of _republican_ Justice. It is to be found in P.\r\n  22—When Britons contemplate the character here delineated, and\r\n  contrast it with the characters of their own Judges to which even\r\n  the licentious tongue of faction has not dared to impute the\r\n  smallest stain, their bosoms must glow with satisfaction of the most\r\n  exalted kind; they must exult in the superior excellence of that\r\n  form of government and of those laws which effectually secure them\r\n  from the evils of a vicious, corrupt, or partial distribution of\r\n  justice. After giving an historical detail of the proceedings\r\n  against him, accompanied by copies of the warrant to apprehend him,\r\n  the imputed libels, the bill of indictment, and the Judge’s charge,\r\n  Peter exclaims—“This, when it comes to be served up in Britain, will\r\n  be a dish for a king. The royalists will lick their lips, and the\r\n  republicans will cry, God bless us! The emigrations _for liberty’s\r\n  sake_ will cease, and we shall have nothing but the pure\r\n  unadulterated dregs of Newgate and the Fleet, the candidates for\r\n  Tyburn and Botany Bay—Blessed cargo! All _patriots_ to the backbone:\r\n  true philanthropists and universal citizens: fit for any place but\r\n  England in this world and heaven in the next!”\r\n\r\n  But, notwithstanding the Judge’s charge, the most partial and\r\n  scandalous charge, we conceive, that ever was delivered _out of\r\n  France_, the Grand Jury refused to find the bill, and the\r\n  prosecution of course ceased. The Judge, not less disappointed than\r\n  the prosecutor, on this occasion, took an early opportunity—to his\r\n  infamy be it recorded!—of declaring from the Bench that the Grand\r\n  Jury would not _do their duty_. What would the disaffected in this\r\n  country say were any British Judge to use such language? The gross\r\n  imputations cast upon the character of our author by this\r\n  _impartial_ Judge, have extorted from Peter a tribute of justice to\r\n  himself which the occasion most amply justifies. As the account here\r\n  given perfectly accords with all the information we have received\r\n  from persons of undoubted veracity who know him well, and as it\r\n  fully corroborates the opinion we ourselves have formed of him, from\r\n  an attentive perusal of his publications, we shall extract it for\r\n  the satisfaction of our readers:—“It hardly ever becomes a man to\r\n  say much of his private character or concerns; but on this occasion\r\n  I trust I shall be indulged for a moment. I will say, and I will\r\n  make that saying good, whosoever shall oppose it, that I never\r\n  attacked any one, whose private character is not, in every light in\r\n  which it can possibly be viewed as far beneath mine as infamy is\r\n  beneath honour. Nay, I defy the city of Philadelphia, populous as it\r\n  is, and respectable as are many of its inhabitants, to produce me a\r\n  single man who is more sober, industrious, or honest; who is a\r\n  kinder husband, a tenderer father, a better master, a fonder friend,\r\n  or (though last not least) a more zealous and faithful subject.\r\n\r\n  “Most certainly it is unseemly in any one to say this much of\r\n  himself unless compelled to it by some public outrage on his\r\n  character; but when the accusation is made notorious so ought the\r\n  defence; and I do again and again repeat, that I fear not a\r\n  comparison between my character and that of any man in this city:\r\n  no, not even with that of the very Judge, who held me as the worst\r\n  of miscreants. His Honour is welcome, if he please, to carry this\r\n  comparison into _all_ the actions of our lives, public and\r\n  _domestic_, and to extend it beyond ourselves to _every branch of\r\n  our families_.\r\n\r\n  “As to my writing, I never did slander any one, if the promulgation\r\n  of useful truths be not slander. Innocence and virtue I have often\r\n  endeavoured to defend, but I never defamed either. I have, indeed,\r\n  stripped the close-drawn veil of hypocrisy; I have ridiculed the\r\n  follies, and lashed the vices of thousands, and have done it\r\n  sometimes perhaps with a rude and violent hand. But these are not\r\n  the days for gentleness and mercy. Such as is the temper of the foe,\r\n  such must be that of his opponent. Seeing myself published as a\r\n  rogue, _and my wife a whore_; being persecuted with such infamous,\r\n  such base and hellish calumny in the _philanthropic_ city of\r\n  Philadelphia, merely for asserting _the truth_ respecting others,\r\n  was not calculated, I assure you, to sweeten my temper, and turn my\r\n  ink into honey-dew.\r\n\r\n  “My attachment to order and good government, nothing but the\r\n  impudence of Jacobinism can deny. The object not only of my own\r\n  publications, but also of all those which I have introduced or\r\n  encouraged, from the first moment that I appeared on the public\r\n  scene to the present day, has been to lend some aid in stemming the\r\n  torrent of anarchy and confusion. To undeceive the misguided, by\r\n  tearing the mask from the artful and ferocious villains who owing to\r\n  the infatuation of the poor, and the supineness of the rich, have\r\n  made such fearful progress in the destruction of all that is amiable\r\n  and good and sacred among men. To the government of this country in\r\n  particular it has been my constant study to yield all the support in\r\n  my power. When that government, or the worthy men who administer it\r\n  have been traduced and vilified, I have stood forward in their\r\n  defence, and that too, in times when its friends were some of them\r\n  locked up in silence, and others giving way to the audacious\r\n  violence of its foes. Not that I am so foolishly vain as to\r\n  attribute to my illiterate voter a thousandth part of the merit my\r\n  friends are inclined to allow it. As I wrote the other day to a\r\n  gentleman who had paid me some compliments on this score, ‘I should\r\n  never look on my family with a dry eye if I did not hope to outlive\r\n  my works’. They are mere transitory beings to which the\r\n  revolutionary storm has given life, and which with that storm will\r\n  expire. But, what I contend for and what nobody can deny, I have\r\n  done all that laid in my power, all that I was able by any means to\r\n  accomplish in order to counteract the nefarious effects of the\r\n  enemies of the American government and nation.\r\n\r\n  “With respect to religion, altho’ Mr. M’Kean was pleased to number\r\n  it among the things that were in danger from the licentiousness of\r\n  the press, and of course from poor _me_, I think it would puzzle the\r\n  devil himself to produce from my writings, a single passage, which\r\n  could, by all the powers of perversion be twisted into an attack\r\n  upon it. But it would on the contrary be extremely easy to prove,\r\n  that I have at all times, when an opportunity offered, repelled the\r\n  attacks of its enemies, the abominable battalions of Deists and\r\n  Atheists, with all my heart, with all my mind, with all my soul, and\r\n  with all my strength. The bitterest drop in my pen has ever been\r\n  bestowed upon them; because, of all the foes of the human race, I\r\n  look upon them, after the devil, as being the greatest and most\r\n  dreadful. Not a sacrilegious plunderer from Henry VIII. to\r\n  Condorcet, and from Condorcet to the impious Sans-culottes of\r\n  France, has escaped my censure. All those, who have attempted to\r\n  degrade religion whether by open insults and cruelties to the\r\n  clergy, by blasphemous publications or by the more dangerous poison\r\n  of the malignant modern philosophy, I have ranked amongst the most\r\n  infamous of mankind, and have treated them accordingly.”\r\n\r\n  In the concluding part of his tract the author clearly convicts the\r\n  Judge of the most decided and most flagrant partiality. He quotes a\r\n  number of infamous libels, on religious and political subjects,\r\n  which had never roused the indignation, nor even excited the\r\n  censure, of those whose duty it is to preserve the public peace and\r\n  to enforce a due observance of the laws. If, indeed, we were to\r\n  judge, from this specimen, of the mode of administring justice in\r\n  America, in matters of libel, we should conclude, that every degree\r\n  of licentiousness is allowed to those who seek to debauch the minds\r\n  of the people, to seduce them from their allegiance, and to dissolve\r\n  every tie which religion and morality have formed for the happiness\r\n  of men in a social state, while the upright supporters of virtue,\r\n  whose labours are directed to the prevention of anarchy and\r\n  rebellion, by detecting the views and exposing the machinations of\r\n  their abettors, are the sole objects not merely of _pro_secution but\r\n  of _per_secution.\r\n\r\n  The abuse bestowed on the mild and beneficent sovereigns of these\r\n  realms by the Democratic factions in the American Congress, is\r\n  almost equal in severity to the censures lavished by some members of\r\n  opposition during the _last_ parliament in the British Senate, on\r\n  the Kings of Prussia and Hungary, _before_ those monarchs had become\r\n  allies of _France_.\r\n\r\n  The following extracts will, at once, afford a criterion of the\r\n  political principles of public men, in the State of Pennsylvania,\r\n  and a curious specimen of republican _morality_.\r\n\r\n  “The _Governor_ (Mifflin) attended at a civic festival, when the\r\n  following toasts were drunk, which were published in most of the\r\n  newspapers.[331]\r\n\r\n  “‘Those _illustrious citizens_ sent to Botany Bay. May they be\r\n  _speedily recalled_ by their country in _the day of her\r\n  regeneration_.’\r\n\r\n  “‘May the spirit of parliamentary reform in Britain and Ireland\r\n  _burst the bonds of corruption, and overwhelm the foes of liberty_.’\r\n\r\n  “‘The _sans-culottes_ of France. May the robes of _all_ the\r\n  _Emperors_, _Kings_, _Princes_, and _Potentates_ [not excepting the\r\n  _King of Spain_] now employed in suppressing the flame of liberty,\r\n  be cut up to make breeches.’\r\n\r\n  “This is pretty ‘_decent_’ in a _Governor_; but without stopping to\r\n  remark on the peculiar _decency_ of his toasting a gang of\r\n  _convicts_, let us come to another instance of his conduct, full as\r\n  ‘_decent_’ as this.\r\n\r\n  “At the civic festival, held in this city in 1794, to celebrate the\r\n  dethronement of ‘our great and good ally, Louis XVI.’ there were\r\n  ‘assembled,’ according to the ‘_procès verbal_’ which was sent to\r\n  the Paris convention, ‘the CHIEFS, _civil and military_’. This\r\n  _procès verbal_ contains a letter to the convention, in which the\r\n  following honourable mention is made of the governor. ‘The Governor\r\n  of Pennsylvania, that _ardent friend of the French republic_, was\r\n  present, and partook of _all our enthusiasm_ and _all our\r\n  sentiments_.’[332]\r\n\r\n  “I believe they spoke truth; for the cannons of the State were\r\n  fired, and military companies, with drums beating and colours\r\n  flying, attended the execrable fête, one of the ceremonies of which\r\n  was _burning the English flag_; and as to the sentiments contained\r\n  in the _oaths_ and _speeches_ (for there were both) they abounded in\r\n  insults towards almost all the princes of the earth, but\r\n  particularly the King of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n  “A Judge of Pennsylvania, REDMAN, was, in November, 1795, caught\r\n  thieving in the shop of MR. FOLWELL, the dry-goods merchant in Front\r\n  Street. MR. FOLWELL detected him, took the money ($300) from him,\r\n  and kicked him into the street. His _friends_, among the most\r\n  intimate of whom was His Excellency the Governor, advised him to\r\n  _retire_; and he is still living at his ease about 20 miles from the\r\n  city. No justice was ever done to him; he was never censured, not\r\n  even in the newspapers! Such is the cowardly, base, and worthless\r\n  press of America. Such are _republican judges_, and such is\r\n  republican morality! But this is not the worst. I know a Judge who\r\n  _committed murder_! wilful murder, and that, too, previous to his\r\n  appointment by this our republican Governor!\r\n\r\n  “I only give a sort of hint here. One day or other if it pleases God\r\n  to spare my life, I will publish such a collection of facts as will\r\n  shock the universe.\r\n\r\n  “A Pennsylvania _Judge’s wife_ had, a little while ago, a child, by\r\n  a man who kept a livery stable. The _lady_ says, the stableman is\r\n  the best of the two and so has married him, though _his Honour_ is\r\n  still living. I need not name the parties, for though the cowardly\r\n  newspapers have never noticed the affair it is notorious enough.\r\n\r\n  “There are more bastards born annually in the single state of\r\n  Pennsylvania, than in all the British dominions: and as to\r\n  cuckoldom, I will only say that every paper teems with\r\n  _advertisements of wives eloped_ from the bed and board of their\r\n  husbands. I do not hence insinuate that there are _no good people_\r\n  here. There are many. As many as in most countries; but then people\r\n  will, and do allow, that the morals of the country are approaching\r\n  fast to that state, which has never yet failed to prove the ruin of\r\n  every thing held in esteem amongst men.”\r\n\r\n  In proving the falsehood of the assertion so frequently repeated, as\r\n  well on this as on the other side of the Atlantic, that “in\r\n  _America_ the press is _free_ and truth is _not_ a libel,” our\r\n  author adverts to a letter of DR. PRIESTLEY’S on that subject which\r\n  he promises hereafter to expose more fully (a promise which we trust\r\n  he will not forget); and then introduces the following curious\r\n  anecdote, which we extract for the benefit of the Doctor’s political\r\n  friends and admirers in Europe. “But since the Doctor wrote that\r\n  letter it seems experience has changed his opinion. He has suffered\r\n  the just punishment of his malignancy against his country; he has\r\n  been cheated, neglected, and scorned. He is now in an obscurity\r\n  hardly penetrable; he is reduced to poverty and bursting with\r\n  vexation” (may a restless spirit of innovation, springing from, and\r\n  nourished by, a bigotted vanity and a turbulent pride ever\r\n  experience a similar fate)! All this has had an effect; and I will\r\n  state as a fact, which I call upon him to deny if he can, that he\r\n  has lately declared “that _Republican governments are the most\r\n  arbitrary in the world_”! This MACHIAVEL had said before, and this\r\n  all unprejudiced men of reading and observation had long since\r\n  admitted; but, we confess we little expected to hear DOCTOR\r\n  PRIESTLEY subscribe to the creed of the one, or to the\r\n  acknowledgments of the other. Adversity, however, is an able\r\n  advocate in the cause of TRUTH.\r\n\r\n  The Address to the People of England, which is prefixed to the\r\n  publication, is short, but pointed and expressive. It breathes the\r\n  true spirit of a Briton. Of the literary merit of the work, after\r\n  the ample analysis which we have given of its contents, and the\r\n  extracts which we have made, little remains to be said. We agree\r\n  with the publisher, who in the Advertisement says: “The author has\r\n  been more anxious to strengthen his arguments than to polish his\r\n  style, to convince the judgment than to flatter the taste,” but\r\n  those critics must be more “_delicate_” or fastidious who can reject\r\n  substantial advantages for fanciful defects. Though Peter aim not at\r\n  embellishments, he possesses great strength and energy of language,\r\n  and generally writes with more accuracy than most of the American\r\n  authors, who, be it observed, have a phraseology peculiar to\r\n  themselves. This tract contains much important information, and we\r\n  strenuously recommend it to the serious perusal of our countrymen;\r\n  particularly to such of them as are disposed to question the\r\n  superior advantages which they enjoy, over ALL republican states\r\n  under our own well-poised and limited MONARCHY. The following\r\n  admonitions with which the author concludes, will, we trust, have a\r\n  due effect on the minds of those to whom they are addressed. “Such,\r\n  _Britons_, is the fruit of republican government _here_; not among\r\n  the apish and wolfish French, but among a people descended from the\r\n  same ancestors as yourselves. When your monarchial government bears\r\n  such fruits, let it, I say, be hewn down and cast into the fire; but\r\n  till that disgraceful and dreadful day comes, watch over it with\r\n  care and defend it to the last drop of your blood, preserve it as\r\n  you would a golden casket, the apple of your eye, or the last dear\r\n  gift of your dying parents. With this I conclude, praying the God of\r\n  our fathers to lead you in the practice of all their virtues, to\r\n  give wisdom to your minds and strength to your arms, to keep you\r\n  firm and united, honest and generous, loyal, brave, and free; but\r\n  above all, to preserve you from the desolating and degrading curse\r\n  of revolutionary madness and modern _republicanism_.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        PETER PORCUPINE’S WILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [By WILLIAM COBBETT. Published in _The Anti-Jacobin Review and\r\n  Magazine_; or Monthly Political and Literary Censor: from July to\r\n  December, 1798. Vol. i., pp. 725–8.—ED.]\r\n\r\nIn the name of Fun, Amen. I PETER PORCUPINE, Pamphleteer and Newsmonger,\r\nbeing (as yet) sound both in body and in mind, do, this fifteenth day of\r\n_April_, in the Year of our Lord, one thousand seven hundred and\r\nninety-seven, make, declare, and publish, this my LAST WILL AND\r\nTESTAMENT, in manner, form, and substance following; to wit:\r\n\r\n      IN PRIMIS,\r\n\r\nI leave my body to Doctor Michael Lieb, a member of the Legislature of\r\nPennsylvania, to be by him dissected (if he knows how to do it) in\r\npresence of the Rump of the Democratic Society. In it they will find a\r\nheart that held them in abhorrence, that never palpitated at their\r\nthreats, and that, to its last beat, bade them defiance. But my chief\r\nmotive for making this bequest is, that my spirit may look down with\r\ncontempt on their cannibal-like triumph over a breathless corpse.\r\n\r\n_Item._ As I make no doubt that the above said Doctor Lieb (and some\r\nother Doctors that I could mention) would like very well to skin me, I\r\nrequest that they, or one of them may do it, and that the said Lieb’s\r\nfather may tan my skin; after which I desire my Executors to have seven\r\ncopies of my Works complete, bound in it, one copy to be presented to\r\nthe Five Sultans of France, one to each of their Divans, one to the\r\nGovernor of Pennsylvania, to Citizens Maddison, Giles, and Gallatin one\r\neach, and the remaining one to the Democratic Society of Philadelphia,\r\nto be carefully preserved among their archives.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To the Mayor, Aldermen, and Councils of the City of\r\nPhiladelphia, I bequeath all the sturdy young hucksters, who infest the\r\nmarket, and who to maintain their bastards, tax the honest inhabitants\r\nmany thousand pounds annually. I request them to take them into their\r\nworshipful keeping; to chasten their bodies for the good of their souls;\r\nand moreover to keep a sharp look-out after their gallants; and remind\r\nthe latter of the old proverb: _Touch pot, touch penny_.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To T—— J——son, Philosopher, I leave a curious Norway Spider,\r\nwith a hundred legs and nine pair of eyes; likewise the first black\r\ncut-throat general he can catch hold of, to be flead alive, in order to\r\ndetermine with more certainty the real cause of the dark colour of his\r\nskin; and should the said T—— J——son survive Banneker the Almanack\r\nMaker; I request he will get the brains of said Philomath carefully\r\ndissected, to satisfy the world in what respects they differ from those\r\nof a white man.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To the Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, I will and\r\nbequeath a correct copy of Thornton’s plan for abolishing the use of the\r\nEnglish language, and for introducing in its stead a republican one, the\r\nrepresentative characters of which bear a strong resemblance to\r\npot-hooks and hangers; and for the discovery of which plan, the said\r\nsociety did, in the year 1793, grant to the said language maker 500\r\ndollars premium. It is my earnest desire, that the copy of this valuable\r\nperformance, which I hereby present, may be shown to all the travelling\r\nliterati, as a proof of the ingenuity of the author and of the wisdom of\r\nthe society.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To Doctor Benjamin Rush, I will and bequeath a copy of _The\r\nCensor_ for January, 1797; but, upon the express condition, that he does\r\nnot in anywise or guise, either at the time of my death, or _Six months\r\nafter_, pretend to speak, write, or publish an eulogium on me, my\r\ncalling or character, either literary, military, civil, or political.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To my dear fellow labourer Noah Webster, “gentleman-citizen,”\r\nEsq. and News-man, I will and bequeath a prognosticating barometer of\r\ncurious construction and great utility, by which, at a single glance,\r\nthe said Noah will be able to discern the exact state that the public\r\nmind will be in in the ensuing year, and will thereby be enabled to\r\n_trim by degrees_ and not expose himself to detection, as he now does by\r\nhis sudden lee-shore tacks. I likewise bequeath to the said\r\n“gentleman-citizen,” six Spanish milled dollars, to be expended on a new\r\nplate of his portrait at the head of his spelling book, that which\r\ngraces it at present being so ugly that it scares the children from\r\ntheir lessons; but this legacy is to be paid him only upon condition\r\nthat he leave out the title of _’Squire_, at the bottom of said picture,\r\nwhich is extremely odious in an American school-book, and must\r\ninevitably tend to corrupt the political principles of the republican\r\nbabies that behold it. And I do most earnestly desire, exhort and\r\nconjure the said ’Squire news-man, to change the title of his paper,\r\n_The Minerva_, for that of _The Political Centaur_.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To F. A. Mughlenburg, Esq., Speaker of a late house of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States, I leave a most superbly finished\r\nstatue of Janus.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To Tom the Tinker, I leave a liberty-cap, a tricoloured cockade,\r\na wheel-barrow full of oysters, and a hogshead of grog: I also leave him\r\nthree blank checks on the bank of Pennsylvania, leaving to him the task\r\nof _filling them up_; requesting him, however, to be rather more\r\nmerciful than he has shown himself heretofore.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To the Governor of Pennsylvania, and to the late President and\r\nCashier of the Bank of the said State, as to joint Legatees, I will and\r\nbequeath that good old proverb: _Honesty is the best policy_. And this\r\nlegacy I have chosen for these worthy gentlemen, as the only thing about\r\nwhich I am sure they will never disagree.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To T—— Coxe, of Philadelphia, citizen, I will and bequeath a\r\ncrown of hemlock, as a recompense for his attempt to throw an odium on\r\nthe administration of General Washington; and I most positively enjoin\r\nmy Executors, to see that the said crown be shaped exactly like that\r\nwhich this spindle-shanked legatee wore before Gen. Howe, when he made\r\nhis triumphal entry into Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To Thomas Lord Bradford (otherwise called Goosy Tom),\r\nBookseller, Printer, News-man, and member of the Philosophical Society\r\nof Philadelphia, I will and bequeath a copy of the peerage of Great\r\nBritain, in order that the said Lord Thomas may the more exactly\r\nascertain what probability there is of his succeeding to the seat, which\r\nhis noble relation now fills in the House of Lords.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To all and singular the authors in the United States, whether\r\nthey write verse or prose, I will and bequeath a copy of my Life and\r\nAdventures; and I advise the said authors to study with particular care\r\nthe 40th and 41st pages thereof; more especially and above all things, I\r\nexhort and conjure them never to _publish it together_, though the\r\nbookseller should be a saint.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To Edmund Randolph, Esq., late Secretary of State, to Mr. J. A.\r\nDallas, Secretary of the State of Pennsylvania, and to His Excellency,\r\nThomas Miffin, Governor of the said unfortunate State, I will and\r\nbequeath, to each of them, a copy of the sixteenth paragraph of\r\nFauchet’s _intercepted letter_.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To Citizen John Swanwick, member of Congress, by the will and\r\nconsent of the sovereign people, I leave bills of Exchange on London to\r\nan enormous amount; they are _all protested_, indeed, but if properly\r\nmanaged, may be turned to good account. I likewise bequeath to the said\r\nJohn a small treatise by an Italian author, wherein the secret of\r\npleasing the ladies is developed, and reduced to a mere mechanical\r\noperation, without the least dependence on the precarious aid of the\r\npassions. Hoping that these instances of my liberality will produce, in\r\nthe mind of the little legislature, effects quite different from those\r\nproduced therein by the King of Great Britain’s pension to his parents.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To the Editors of the _Boston Chronicle_, the _New York Argus_,\r\nand the _Philadelphia Merchants’ Advertiser_, I will and bequeath one\r\nounce of modesty and love of truth, to be equally divided between them.\r\n\r\nI should have been more liberal in this bequest, were I not well\r\nassured, that one ounce is more than they will ever make use of.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To Franklin Bache, Editor of the _Aurora of Philadelphia_, I\r\nwill and bequeath a small bundle of French assignats, which I brought\r\nwith me from the country of equality. If these should be too light in\r\nvalue for his pressing exigencies, I desire my executors, or any one of\r\nthem, to bestow on him a second part to what he has lately received in\r\nSouthwark: and as a further proof of my good will and affection, I\r\nrequest him to accept of a gag and a brand new pair of fetters, which,\r\nif he should refuse, I will and bequeath him in lieu thereof—my\r\nmalediction.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To my beloved countrymen, the people of Old England, I will and\r\nbequeath a copy of Doctor Priestley’s _Charity Sermon for the benefit of\r\npoor Emigrants_; and to the said preaching philosopher himself, I\r\nbequeath a heart full of disappointment, grief, and despair.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To the good people of France, who remain attached to their\r\nsovereign, particularly to those among whom I was hospitably received, I\r\nbequeath each a good strong dagger: hoping most sincerely that they may\r\nyet find courage enough to carry them to the hearts of their abominable\r\ntyrants.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To Citizen M——oe, I will and bequeath my chamber looking-glass.\r\nIt is a plain but exceeding true mirror; in it he will see the exact\r\nlikeness of a traitor, who has bartered the honour and interest of his\r\ncountry to a perfidious and savage enemy.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To the Republican Britons, who have fled from the hands of\r\njustice in their own country, and who are a scandal, a nuisance, and a\r\ndisgrace to this, I bequeath hunger and nakedness, scorn and reproach;\r\nand I do hereby positively enjoin on my executors to contribute five\r\nhundred dollars towards the erection of gallowses and gibbets, for the\r\naccommodation of the said imported patriots, when the legislators of\r\nthis unhappy state shall have the wisdom to countenance such useful\r\nestablishments.\r\n\r\n_Item._ My friend, J. T. Callender, the runaway from Scotland, is, of\r\ncourse, a partaker in the last mentioned legacy; but as a particular\r\nmark of my attention, I will and bequeath him twenty feet of pine plank,\r\nwhich I request my executors to see made into a pillory, to be kept for\r\nhis particular use, till a gibbet can be prepared.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To Tom Paine, the author of _Common Sense_, _Rights of Man_,\r\n_Age of Reason_, and a _Letter to General Washington_, I bequeath a\r\nstrong hempen collar, as the only legacy I can think of that is worthy\r\nof him as well as best adapted to render his death in some measure as\r\ninfamous as his life: and I do hereby direct and order my Executors to\r\nsend it to him by the first safe conveyance with my compliments, and\r\nrequest that he would make use of it without delay, that the national\r\nrazor may not be disgraced by the head of such a monster.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To the gaunt outlandish orator, vulgarly called the Political\r\nSinner, who in the just order of things follows next after the last\r\nmentioned legatee, I bequeath the honour of partaking in his\r\ncatastrophe; that in their deaths, as well as in their lives, all the\r\nworld may exclaim: “_See how rogues hang together_”.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To all and singular the good people of these States, I leave\r\npeace, union, abundance, happiness, untarnished honour, and an\r\nunconquerable everlasting hatred to the French Revolutionists and their\r\ndestructive abominable principles.\r\n\r\n_Item._ To each of my Subscribers I leave a _quill_, hoping that in\r\ntheir hands it may become a sword against every thing that is hostile to\r\nthe government and independence of their country.\r\n\r\n_Lastly._ To my three brothers, Paul, Simon, and Dick, I leave my whole\r\nestate, as well real as personal (first paying the foregoing legacies)\r\nto be equally divided between them, share and share alike. And I do\r\nhereby make and constitute my said three brothers the Executors of this\r\nmy LAST WILL; to see the same performed, according to its true intent\r\nand meaning, as far as in their power lies.\r\n\r\n                                                        PETER PORCUPINE.\r\n\r\n  Witnesses present,\r\n\r\n    Philo Fun,   }\r\n    Jack Jockus. }\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE VISION OF LIBERTY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _Written in the manner of Spenser._\r\n\r\n[As the virulent style of political writing prevalent ninety years ago\r\nis now but little known, the present edition of _The Poetry of the\r\nAnti-Jacobin_ seemed a convenient medium for giving some specimens of it\r\nwhich appeared in _The Anti-Jacobin Review and Magazine_, a work\r\nconducted on the same principles, but by different writers, and with the\r\ncognizance of the government. Two of them were by W. COBBETT, who, had\r\nhe been less arrogant and contentious, and more consistent, would have\r\nbeen, in the words of Lord Dalling, “a very great man in the world; as\r\nit was he made a great noise in it”. (See pp. 311–319.)\r\n\r\n_The Vision of Liberty_ is by C. KIRKPATRICK SHARPE, an author and\r\nartist much esteemed by Scottish antiquarians, of which specimens only\r\nneed be given. Of _The Anarchists_, the author is not known.]\r\n\r\n                                I.\r\n\r\n      O wretched man, how long wilt thou refuse\r\n      Thy Maker’s favour, and His mercy great?\r\n      How long thy worldly happiness abuse,\r\n      And growl and grumble at thy present state?\r\n      Seeking accursed change both soon and late,\r\n      And newest modes allured still to try—\r\n      England, beware God’s wrath to aggravate,\r\n      For foreign magic blinds thy charmed eye,\r\n      And Liberty, sweet Liberty, is now the constant cry.\r\n\r\n                                II.\r\n\r\n      As on my couch in slumber’s arms I lay,\r\n      A vision did my senses entertain;\r\n      Of late, me thought in France I miss’d my way,\r\n      Amid a columnless deserted plain;\r\n      No man or beast upon it did remain,\r\n      Swept off by Discord’s wide destroying strife:\r\n      Ne planted fence, ne field of waving grain,\r\n      Marking the toiling farmer’s busy life,\r\n      But ruined huts and castles, brent, were wondrous rife.\r\n\r\n                                III.\r\n\r\n      Yet on this plain, most goodly to behold,\r\n      Saw I a temple tow’ring to the sky,\r\n      The dome where of was made of basest gold,\r\n      Most false, but yet most lovely to the eye;\r\n      And rotting pillars reareth it on high,\r\n      Of ghastly human heads, and clotted gore,\r\n      With dust, y’mixt the mortar doth supply,\r\n      While foulest birds still round this temple soar,\r\n      And filthy serpents hiss, and giant hyenas roar.\r\n\r\n                                IV.\r\n\r\n      Among the heads that did the mass compose,\r\n      Three royal skulls were there—one of a king—\r\n      Meek saint, who never once revil’d his foes,\r\n      His bloody foes that him to scaffold bring;\r\n      One of a maid; O heaven! that I could sing\r\n      With Spenser’s tongue, her spotless purity,\r\n      Her holy zeal, in courts so rare a thing,\r\n      By lawless fiends condemn’d she was to die,\r\n      And sent, untimely sent, to seek her native sky.\r\n\r\n                                V.\r\n\r\n      The third I marked with melancholy eyes,\r\n      A female head, that once a crown did wear,\r\n      Cut off in life’s full bloom, now low she lies,\r\n      The loose loves weeping o’er her early bier,\r\n      Nor Virtue’s self denies a tender tear;\r\n      So young a creature, wonder not she fell,\r\n      And left the paths of chastity severe,\r\n      Debauched by a court where lust did dwell\r\n      Like treach’rous Circe, skill’d in many a witching spell.\r\n\r\n                                VI.\r\n\r\n      Ah! where are now her gorgeous robes of state,\r\n      The glitt’ring gems that did her fairness deck?\r\n      The cringing nobles that on her did wait,\r\n      The high-born dames that kneeled at her beck?\r\n      Alas! a ghastly face, a bloody neck,\r\n      A simple winding-sheet is now her share;\r\n      Look here, ye proud ones, on this mighty wreck,\r\n      And learn what perishable stuff ye are,\r\n      From her poor mangled carcase, once so sweet and fair.\r\n\r\n                                VII.\r\n\r\n      And on the ground there lay a murder’d child,\r\n      A piteous sight it was, and full of woe,\r\n      Who, when alive, by every art defil’d,\r\n      With poison, they at last did overthrow,\r\n      Wretches, who never ruth or conscience know;\r\n      O lovely flowret cropt by villain hands,\r\n      How will thy butchers dread th’ almighty brow,\r\n      Arm’d with frowns, when each at judgment stands,\r\n      And God the meed of murder from His throne commands.\r\n\r\n                                VIII.\r\n\r\n      Then o’er the portal was this motto plac’d,\r\n      “The house of liberty,” in gold y’writ,\r\n      And, vent’ring in, I stood like one amaz’d\r\n      Such sights of horror on my heart-strings smit.\r\n      There Infidelity, in moody fit,\r\n      Hugg’d Suicide—there Rage, and deadly Fears,\r\n      There Lechery, with goatish leer did sit,\r\n      And Murder, quaffing up his victim’s tears,\r\n      With thousand other crimes, too foul for human ears.\r\n\r\n                                IX.\r\n\r\n      In ’mid the house an image stood in state,\r\n      Like to VOLTAIRE in visage and in shape,\r\n      Wither’d his heart with fellest rage and hate\r\n      Shrivell’d and lean his carcase like an ape\r\n      And numerous crowds upon the same did gape,\r\n      As he all-naked stood to every eye;\r\n      Above an altar covered with crape,\r\n      And formed of his books one might descry,\r\n      Profane and lewd it was, and cramm’d with many a lie.\r\n\r\n                                X.\r\n\r\n      And still from ’neath the altar roared he,\r\n      As from a bull lowing in cavern deep,\r\n      “Come worship me, _O men_, come worship me;\r\n      Spit on the cross, of Jesus take no keep,\r\n      I promise you an everlasting sleep;\r\n      The soul and body both shall turn to clay;\r\n      Ye penitents, why do ye sigh and weep?\r\n      Let not damnation’s terrors you affray,\r\n      Come learn my lore that drives all foolish fears away”.\r\n\r\n             ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\r\n\r\n                                XIV.\r\n\r\n      Next came that cursed felon THOMAS PAINE,\r\n      Mounted upon a tiger fierce and fell;\r\n      And still a shower of blood on him doth rain,\r\n      With tears that from the eyes of widows well;\r\n      Loud in his ears the cries of orphans yell;\r\n      The axe impending o’er his head alway\r\n      While devils wait to catch his soul to hell,\r\n      The knave is fill’d with anguish and dismay—\r\n      And anxious round he looks, even straws do him affray.\r\n\r\n                                XV.\r\n\r\n      Then saw I mounted on a braying ass\r\n      WILLIAM and MARY, sooth, a couple jolly;\r\n      Who married, note ye how it came to pass,\r\n      Although each held that marriage was but folly.\r\n\r\n             ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\r\n\r\n                                XVIII.\r\n\r\n      Then came MARIA HELEN WILLIAMS STONE,\r\n      Sitting upon a goat with bearded chin;\r\n      And she hath written volumes many a one;\r\n      Better the idle jade had learned to spin.\r\n\r\n             ·       ·       ·       ·       ·\r\n\r\n                                XIX.\r\n\r\n      Next mounted on a monster like a louse,\r\n      With parchments loaded, came a man of law,[333]\r\n      Sprung from an ancient Caledonian house,\r\n      Cunningly could he quibble out a flaw;\r\n      And this sage man would chatter like a daw,\r\n      To prove the moon green cheese, and black, pure white,\r\n      Spitting out treason from his greedy maw;\r\n      To breed sedition was his chief delight,\r\n      And scratch men’s scabs to ulcers still with all his might.\r\n\r\n                                XX.\r\n\r\n      Then on an Irish bull of skin and bone,\r\n      A foul churl[334] rode, who still a harp would strum,\r\n      A harp Hibernian, stringless saving one,\r\n      Well tun’d to harsh sedition’s growling hum;\r\n      He hit the bull on which he had his bum\r\n      Full many a bitter pang, nor gave him rest—\r\n      Dealing his blows on Teagues that round him come,\r\n      Grieving the while for man and brute opprest,\r\n      Chaunting the Irish howl, abhorr’d of man and beast.\r\n\r\n                                XXI.\r\n\r\n      O IRELAND, spot accurs’d—tho’ glorious fair,\r\n      Shines there the sun, the flowers enamell’d blow,\r\n      And scent, with fragrance sweet, the balmy air,\r\n      Rippling the gliding pools that softly flow;\r\n      No noxious reptile there to man a foe\r\n      Abides, but black revenge with cautious plan,\r\n      Cool-blooded cruelty with torments slow,\r\n      Springs rank; with weeds the goodly soil’s o’er-ran,\r\n      And all the reptile’s venom rankles in the man.\r\n\r\n                                XXII.\r\n\r\n      Then in a gorgeous car of beaten gold,\r\n      Drove on a portly man, of mighty rank,[335]\r\n      A person comely, of extraction old;\r\n      But, carrion-like, his reputation stank;\r\n      Sly was the wight, with crafty quip and crank,\r\n      To cram with glittering coin his bursting bags;\r\n      Yet whilom taxing-men play’d him a prank,\r\n      By catching in their traps some strayed nags,\r\n      And eke some livery slaves, in miser’s livery rags.\r\n\r\n                                XXIII.\r\n\r\n      Then on a turtle came proud London’s Mayor,\r\n      Followed by Aldermen, a frowsy crew,\r\n      Strong smelling of Cheapside, and luscious fair,\r\n      Yet apoplexy made his followers few.\r\n      Long antlers on the head of each man grew,\r\n      So that they seem’d a host of moving horn;\r\n      Anon as on they came they’d mump and chew,\r\n      Stuffing their guts from dawning of the morn,\r\n      Till shades of evening fell—for eating only born.\r\n\r\n                                XXIV.\r\n\r\n      On a cock sparrow fed with Spanish flies,\r\n      A swilling Captain came, with liquor mellow,\r\n      And still the crowd in hideous uproar cries,[336]\r\n      “Sing us a bawdy song, thou d——d good fellow”,\r\n      Incontinent he sets himself to bellow,\r\n      And shouts with all the strength that in him lies;\r\n      The Citizets exclaim, “He’s sans pareilly O”;\r\n      The Citizens in raptures roll their eyes,\r\n      And drink with leathern ears, the fool’s lewd ribaldries.\r\n\r\n                                XXV.\r\n\r\n      On came these wights, and many more beside,\r\n      Thick as the grains of sand upon the shore,\r\n      Thick as a swarm of flies in summer tide,\r\n      That on a dunghill hive and hover o’er;\r\n      Most had their hides all scall’d, their trousers tore;\r\n      Many sans breeches, shameless trudg’d along,\r\n      And many a noble knave and titled w——e,\r\n      With Irish bog-trotters would crowd and throng,\r\n      Carolling catches base, and filthy French chanson.\r\n\r\n                                XXVI.\r\n\r\n      Like roaring waves they cover’d all the plain;\r\n      And tho’ equality they still requir’d,\r\n      Each cudgell’d sore his breast with might and main,\r\n      Each to get foremost ardently desir’d.\r\n      Some fell into the dirt, and foul were mir’d,\r\n      The rest rode over them and took no heed.\r\n      Their yells, with patriotic ardour fired,\r\n      So made my flesh to quake with very dread,\r\n      That Morpheus left my couch, and all the vision fled.\r\n\r\nThe insertion of the foregoing poem (which was never printed) into your\r\nentertaining and useful publication, will much oblige,\r\n\r\n

Edited by his Nephews, H. and Sir Bartle\r\n  Frere_, and _The Edinburgh Review_ for April, 1872, p. 476.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  It will be remembered that these eminent persons were chosen by Lord\r\n  Malmesbury to accompany him on his mission to Lille and were\r\n  associated with him in the abortive negotiations for peace.\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  It is surprising that the satirist’s attention was not attracted to\r\n  the scene in _Stella_, in which one of the heroines describes the\r\n  rapid growth of her passion to its object: “I know not if you observed\r\n  that you had enchained my interest from the first moment of our first\r\n  meeting. I at least soon became aware that your eyes sought mine. Ah,\r\n  Fernando, then my uncle brought the music, you took your violin, and,\r\n  as you played, my eyes rested upon you free from care. I studied every\r\n  feature of your face; and, during an unexpected pause, you fixed your\r\n  eyes upon—upon me! They met mine! How I blushed, how I looked away!\r\n  You observed it, Fernando; for from that moment I felt that you looked\r\n  oftener over your music-book, often played out of tune, to the\r\n  disturbance of my uncle. Every false note, Fernando, went to my heart.\r\n  It was the sweetest confusion I ever felt in my life.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  The whole of this _jeu d’esprit_ has been claimed for FRERE, but on\r\n  unsatisfactory evidence. It is much more in CANNING’S way as a student\r\n  of oratory, which FRERE was not.\r\n\r\nFootnote 5:\r\n\r\n  [See pages 32, 34.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 6:\r\n\r\n  [A very eminent Mathematician and Physicist, and the inventor of\r\n  descriptive geometry; born in 1746.

He was superior to bad education and\r\n  disadvantages for forming his character, and turned out certainly a\r\n  first-rate man, though not free from imperfections. His uprightness\r\n  and truth were unequalled; his magnanimity, fortitude and\r\n  consideration, in his last moments, taken so unprepared as he was,\r\n  were astonishing.”\r\n\r\n  On the 16th March, C.

In the interval,\r\n  however, till these golden dreams are realized, it is necessary that\r\n  this ‘_Army of England_,’ while it yet remains in France, should be\r\n  fed, paid, and clothed. For this purpose a new and separate fund is\r\n  provided (in the same spirit with the rest of their measures), and is\r\n  to be termed ‘THE LOAN OF ENGLAND,’ to be raised by anticipation on\r\n  the security and mortgage of all the Lands and Property of this\r\n  Country. This _gasconade_, which sounds too extravagant for reality,\r\n  is nevertheless seriously announced by a message from the Executive\r\n  Directory; and we are told that the Merchants of Paris are eagerly\r\n  offering to advance, on such a security, the money which is to defray\r\n  the expenses of the Expedition against this country.”—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 33:\r\n\r\n  [The above verses refer to the memorable events of the 18th Fructidor,\r\n  Sept. 4, 1797 (the model of Prince Louis Napoléon’s _coup d’état_,\r\n  Dec. 2, 1851), when Rewbell, Barras, and Laréveillère-Lepaux, on the\r\n  plea that the Republic was in danger, got rid of their\r\n  fellow-directors, Carnot (grandfather to the present President of the\r\n  French Republic) and Barthélemy, who were replaced by Merlin and\r\n  François de Neufchateau, dispersed by military force the members of\r\n  the Five Hundred and the Ancients, fifty-three of whom were condemned\r\n  to transportation—banished the editors, &c., of forty-two\r\n  newspapers—annulled the elections of forty-eight departments—and\r\n  effected other arbitrary measures without opposition.

From\r\n  the same authorities we learn, that at Nantz 27,000 persons, of both\r\n  sexes, were murdered; chiefly by drowning them in plugged boats.

Vernon Smith.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 50:\r\n\r\n  Line 19.—[General FITZPATRICK was one of Fox’s most attached friends\r\n  and political supporters. BOSWELL, speaking of a dinner at\r\n  BEAUCLERK’S, 24th April, 1779, says, on a celebrated wit being\r\n  mentioned (believed to be Fitzpatrick), “JOHNSON replied, ‘I have been\r\n  several times in company with him, but never perceived any strong\r\n  power of wit. He produces a general effect by various means; he has a\r\n  cheerful countenance and a gay voice. Besides his trade is wit. It\r\n  would be as wild in him to come into company without merriment, as for\r\n  a highwayman to take the road without his pistols.’” WALPOLE (in his\r\n  _Journal of the Reign of George III._, i. 167, and ii. 560) describes\r\n  him as “an agreeable young man of parts,” and mentions his “genteel\r\n  irony and badinage”. He was Lord Shelburne’s brother-in-law, at whose\r\n  house Johnson might have met him, as well as in Fox’s company. Rogers\r\n  (_Table Talk_, p. 104) said that Fitzpatrick was at one time nearly as\r\n  famous for his wit as Hare. He possessed no mean poetic talents,\r\n  particularly for compositions of wit, fancy, and satire. To the\r\n  _Rolliad_ he contributed “Extract from the Dedication”; Nos. v., ix.\r\n  and xii., in Part I.; and No. v. in Part II.

It is here used for swelling, burly, bombastic writing.\r\n\r\n  There is a picture of HOGARTH’S (the Election Ball, we believe), in\r\n  which there are a number of Hats thrown together in one corner of the\r\n  room; and it is remarked as a peculiar excellence that there is not a\r\n  Hat among them of which you cannot to a certainty point out the owner\r\n  among the figures dancing, or otherwise distributed through the\r\n  picture.\r\n\r\n  We remember to have seen an experiment of this kind tried at one of\r\n  the Universities with the _wig_ and _writings_ here alluded to.

He was born at Carlingford, Ireland, in\r\n  1738. Having obtained the patronage of George, Viscount Townshend,\r\n  Lord-Lieutenant (1767–72), he became the principal writer in the\r\n  “_Batchelor_,” a government paper, distinguished by genuine wit and\r\n  humour, conducted by Simcox, a clergyman; Richard Marlay, afterwards\r\n  Bishop of Waterford and Lismore; Robert Jephson, a dramatic poet of\r\n  note; the Rev. Mr. Boroughs, and others. The chief task of these\r\n  advocates of the Castle was to counteract the “_Baratarian Letters_,”\r\n  an Irish imitation of _Junius_, which, attacking the Lord-Lieutenant’s\r\n  government, received contributions from Flood, and first published\r\n  Grattan’s character of Chatham. At the “Coalition,” 1783, he was\r\n  appointed Surveyor-general of the Ordnance, and henceforward attached\r\n  himself to FOX. He wrote, among other works, _A Poetical Review of the\r\n  Literary and Moral Character of the late Samuel Johnson, LL.D., 1786_;\r\n  _The Rape of Pomona, an Elegiac Epistle from the Waiter at Hockrel to\r\n  the Hon. Mr. Lyttelton, 1773_; _Philosophical Reflections on the late\r\n  Revolution in France_; and a _Biographical Sketch of his own Life_. In\r\n  his _Epistles in Rhyme_ he thus ridicules Horace Walpole’s _Strawberry\r\n  Verses_ on the two Misses Berry:—\r\n\r\n          “Who to love tunes his note, with the fire of old age,\r\n          And chirps the trim lay in a trim Gothic cage.”\r\n\r\n  Walpole, however (_Correspondence_, ix. 434–5), good-naturedly laughed\r\n  at them, saying that these verses on himself were really some of the\r\n  best in the whole set. Courtenay was a member of _The Literary Club_,\r\n  founded by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and figures in several of Gillray’s\r\n  caricatures. He it was who, referring to Gay’s _Beggars’ Opera_,\r\n  designated the author the _Orpheus of Highwaymen_.

To the proof then!\r\n\r\n  In an Ode of the late LORD NUGENT’S are the following spirited lines:\r\n\r\n                “Though CATO liv’d—though TULLY spoke—[58]\r\n                Though BRUTUS dealt the godlike stroke,\r\n                  Yet perish’d fated ROME!”\r\n\r\n  The author above mentioned saw these lines, and liked them—as well he\r\n  might; and as he had a mind to write about Rome himself, he did not\r\n  scruple to enlist them into his service; but he thought it right to\r\n  make a small alteration in their appearance, which he managed thus.\r\n  Speaking of Rome, he says it is the place\r\n\r\n                          “_Where_ CATO liv’d”:—\r\n\r\n  A sober truth! which gets rid at once of all the poetry and spirit of\r\n  the original, and reduces the sentiment from an example of manners,\r\n  virtue, patriotism, from the _vitæ exemplar dedit_ of LORD NUGENT, to\r\n  a mere question of inhabitancy. _Ubi habitavit Cato_—where he was an\r\n  inhabitant-householder, paying scot and lot, and had a house on the\r\n  right-hand side of the way, as you go down _Esquiline_ Hill, just\r\n  opposite to the poulterer’s. But to proceed—\r\n\r\n                 “_Where_ CATO liv’d; where TULLY spoke,\r\n                 Where BRUTUS dealt the godlike stroke—\r\n                   —_By which his glory rose_!!!”\r\n\r\n  The last line is _not_ borrowed.\r\n\r\n  We question whether the history of modern literature can produce an\r\n  instance of a theft so shameless, and turned to so little advantage.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 58:\r\n\r\n  [Horace Walpole, in a letter to Hannah More, quotes one word of these\r\n  verses incorrectly, writing:—“Though Cato _died_,” an error which P.\r\n  Cunningham allows to pass, as also another, that _Mr._—instead of\r\n  _Lord_—Nugent wrote them.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 59:\r\n\r\n  Line 26.—[Sir ROBERT ADAIR.

It is called “_Part_ of a Letter,” because it is a\r\n  portion of a longer one, being only the part devoted to a vindication\r\n  of the writer’s uncle, Admiral Lord Keppel, and of Fox; with\r\n  characteristic delineations of Sir G. Saville, the Marquis of\r\n  Rockingham, Lord North, and George Byng, M.P., on all of whom he\r\n  passes great compliments.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 60:\r\n\r\n  _And loads the blunderbuss with_ BEDFORD’S _brains._—This line is\r\n  wholly unintelligible without a note.

ROBT. ADAIR, in\r\n  answer to MR. BURKE’S “Letter to the D. of B.,” nothing is so\r\n  remarkable as the studious imitation of Mr. Burke’s style.\r\n\r\n  His vehemence, and his passion, and his irony, his wild imagery, his\r\n  far-sought illustrations, his rolling and lengthened periods, and the\r\n  short quick pointed sentences in which he often condenses as much\r\n  wisdom and wit as others would expand through pages, or through\r\n  volumes,—all these are carefully kept in view by his opponent, though\r\n  not always very artificially copied or applied.\r\n\r\n  But imitators are liable to be led strangely astray; and never was\r\n  there an instance of a more complete mistake of a plain meaning, than\r\n  that which this line is intended to illustrate—a mistake no less than\r\n  that of a _coffin_ for a _corpse_. This is hard to believe or to\r\n  comprehend—but you shall hear.\r\n\r\n  MR. BURKE, in one of his publications, had talked of the French\r\n  “_unplumbing_ the dead in order to destroy the living,”—by which he\r\n  intended, without doubt, not metaphorically, but literally,\r\n  “_stripping the dead of their_ LEADEN COFFINS, _and then making them_\r\n  (_not the_ DEAD _but the_ COFFINS) _into bullets_”. A circumstance\r\n  perfectly notorious at the time the book was written.\r\n\r\n  But this does not satisfy our author. He determines to retort MR.\r\n  BURKE’S own words upon him; and unfortunately “reaching at a\r\n  metaphor,” where MR. BURKE only intended a fact, he falls into the\r\n  little mistake above mentioned, and by a stroke of his pen transmutes\r\n  the illustrious HEAD of the house of RUSSELL into a metal, to which it\r\n  is not for us to say how near or how remote his affinity may possibly\r\n  have been. He writes thus—“_If_ MR. BURKE _had been content with\r\n  ‘unplumbing’ a dead Russell, and hewing_ HIM (observe—not the coffin,\r\n  but HIM—the old dead Russell himself) _into grape and canister, to\r\n  sweep down the whole generation of his descendants_,” _&c., &c._\r\n\r\n  The thing is scarcely credible; but IT IS SO!

These\r\nobservations were there pointed at the father of Lord Moira, but have\r\nbeen adapted by the Author of the _Ode_ and the Artist to the son.\r\n\r\n_Lord Moira._—“My Lords, I rise to return my thanks to the Noble Lord\r\nwho spoke last. I can testify the truth of all he has asserted. At the\r\ntime of the Insurrection in the North, I had frequent and intimate\r\nconversations with that celebrated enchanter, _Moll Coggin_. I have\r\noften seen her riding on a black ram with a blue tail. Once I\r\nendeavoured to fire at her, but my gun melted in my hand into a clear\r\njelly. This jelly I tasted, and if it had been a little more acid, it\r\nwould have been most excellent. The Noble Lords may laugh; but I declare\r\nthe fact upon my veracity, which has never been doubted. Once I pursued\r\nthis fiend into my ale cellar: she rode instantly out of my sight into\r\nthe bung-hole of a beer barrel. She was at that time mounted on her\r\nblack ram with the blue tail. Some time after, my servants were much\r\nsurprised to find their ale full of _blue hairs_. I was not surprised,\r\nas I knew the blue _hairs_ were the hairs of the ram’s _blue tail_.\r\nNoble Lords may stare, but the fact is as I relate it. This _Moll\r\nCoggin_ was the fiend who raised the _Oak-boys_ to rebellion. I was also\r\nwell acquainted with the two Cow-boys mentioned by the Noble Lord; they\r\nwere my tenants, and were certainly endowed with supernatural powers. I\r\nhave known one of them tear up by the roots an Oak two hundred feet\r\nhigh, and bear it upright on his head four miles! his party were on that\r\naccount called Oak-boys. Noble Lords may laugh, but I speak from certain\r\nknowledge. The Oak-tree grew in my garden, and I have often seen five\r\nhundred Swans perching on its boughs; these swans were remarkable for\r\ndestroying all the snipes in the country—they flew faster than any snipe\r\nI ever saw, and you may imagine a small bird could make but a feeble\r\nresistance in the talons of a swan. I hope, my Lords, you will pardon my\r\nwandering a little from the present subject,” &c.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 68:\r\n\r\nLine 17.—[“One night after _nine o’clock_, a party of Soldiers saw a\r\nlight in a house by the road-side—they went and ordered it to be\r\nextinguished immediately: the people of the house begged that the light\r\nmight be suffered to remain because there was a child belonging to the\r\nfamily in convulsion fits, who must expire for want of help if the\r\npeople were to be without fire and candle; _but this request_ HAD NO\r\nEFFECT.” _Lord Moira’s Speech in the House of Lords, November 22, 1797._\r\nThis statement was, however, satisfactorily disproved. The incident\r\nforms a feature in the accompanying engraving. Notwithstanding official\r\ndenials, it has long been admitted that the conduct of the Soldiery in\r\nIreland was simply infamous. Billeting on Catholics and reputed\r\nmalcontents of the better class appears to have been invariably as an\r\nunlimited licence for robbery, devastation, ravishment, and, in case of\r\nresistance, murder. Sir Ralph Abercromby, on assuming the command of the\r\narmy in Ireland, declared, in general orders, that their habits and\r\ndiscipline were such as to render them “formidable to everybody but the\r\nenemy”.

RAIKES’S _Journal_ (November,\r\n1836):—“George IV. never had any private friends: he selected his\r\nconfidants from his minions. M‘MAHON was an Irishman of low birth and\r\nobsequious manners: he was a little man, his face red, covered with\r\npimples; always dressed in the blue and buff uniform, with his hat on\r\none side, copying the air of his master, to whom he was a prodigious\r\nfoil, and ready to execute any commissions, which in those days were\r\nsomewhat complicated.” He was private secretary and keeper of the privy\r\npurse to King George IV. when Prince Regent, was sworn of the Privy\r\nCouncil, and created a Baronet, 7th August, 1817, with remainder, in\r\ndefault of male issue, to his brother. SIR JOHN died 12th September,\r\n1817, the title devolving on his brother THOMAS, a distinguished\r\nmilitary officer, who was Adjutant-General of Her Majesty’s forces in\r\nIndia, Lieut.-Gov. of Portsmouth, Commander-in-Chief of the Bombay Army,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nSIR JOHN M‘MAHON left a large personal property, amounting to £90,000.\r\nOne of his bequests is thus worded: “To THOMAS MARRABLE, a dear and\r\nesteemed friend, £2000; and with my last prayers for the glory and\r\nhappiness of the best-hearted man in the world, the PRINCE REGENT, I\r\nbequeath him the said Thomas Marrable, an invaluable servant”. The\r\nlatter was a member of the household of King George IV., and one of his\r\nconfidential agents. A full-length portrait of him as one of the\r\nprocession is given in Sir G. Nayler’s history of the coronation of that\r\nmonarch.\r\n\r\nAmong Gillray’s _Caricatures_ is an amusing one, engraved but not\r\ndesigned by him, published in 1804, representing the Heir-Apparent,\r\nmounted on a tall horse, with the much smaller person of M‘Mahon\r\nconsequentially riding on a diminutive steed at his side, passing the\r\ngates of Carlton House.

They lay claim, it is\r\ntrue, to the merit of having prevented war on that occasion. But if war\r\nhad then taken place with England for one act of violence comparatively\r\ntrivial, Russia, in all probability, would not have ventured upon a\r\nsecond and still greater aggression, involving the existence of a\r\nnation, with the certainty of a second war.

In order to escape prosecution\r\nfor sedition, he took as his subject Greek and Roman history, and had\r\ningenuity enough to give such a colouring to events and characters, as\r\nto render the application to living persons and present events an\r\nexciting mental exercise. I heard one or two of these lectures, and\r\nthought very differently of him then from what I thought afterwards.\r\nWhen, however, he found his popularity on the wane, and more stringent\r\nlaws had been passed, to which he individually gave occasion, he came to\r\nthe prudent resolution of abandoning his vagrant habits, and leading a\r\nfarmer’s life in a beautiful place near Brecon.... He was an amiable man\r\nin private life, an affectionate husband, and a fond father.

THELWALL, unlike Hardy, had the\r\nweakness of vanity; but he was a perfectly honest man, and had a power\r\nof declamation which qualified him to be a mob orator. He used to say\r\nthat if he were at the gallows with liberty to address the people for\r\nhalf-an-hour, he should not fear the result; he was sure he could excite\r\nthem to a rescue.

His person, large, muscular, and clumsy, was\r\ndestitute of grace or dignity, though he possessed much activity. At a\r\ntime when men of every description wore hair-powder and a queue, he had\r\nthe courage to cut his hair short, and to renounce powder, which he\r\nnever used except when going to court. In his youth he led a most\r\nlicentious life, having frequently passed the whole night in excesses of\r\nevery kind, and even lain down, when intoxicated, occasionally to sleep\r\nin the streets, or on a block of wood. In cleanliness he was negligent\r\nto so great a degree that he rarely made use of water for the purpose of\r\nbodily refreshment and comfort.” Complaining one day to Dudley North\r\nthat he was a martyr to the rheumatism, and had ineffectually tried\r\nevery remedy for its relief, “Pray, my lord,” said he, “did you ever try\r\na clean shirt?” It must not be forgotten, however, that he was a\r\nmunificent patron of literature, for he defrayed the entire expense of\r\nprinting Taylor’s Translation of Plato, 5 vols. 4to.; Dallaway’s History\r\nof Sussex, 2 vols. 4to.; and Duncumb’s History of Herefordshire, 2 vols.\r\nThe initials B.

The same does not hold true of any other\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nFootnote 207:\r\n\r\nVer. 17. _Acoustics_—The doctrine or theory of sound.\r\n\r\nFootnote 208:\r\n\r\nVer. 18. _Euclid and Algebra_—The loves and nuptials of these two\r\ninteresting personages, forming a considerable episode in the third\r\ncanto, are purposely omitted here.\r\n\r\nFootnote 209:\r\n\r\nVer. 19. _Pulley_—So called from our Saxon word to PULL, signifying to\r\npull or draw.\r\n\r\nFootnote 210:\r\n\r\nVer. 23. _Fair sylphish forms_—_Vide_ modern prints of nymphs and\r\nshepherds dancing to nothing at all.\r\n\r\nFootnote 211:\r\n\r\nVer. 27. _Such rich confusion_—Imitated from the following genteel and\r\nsprightly lines in the first canto of the “Loves of the Plants”:\r\n\r\n          “So bright its folding canopy withdrawn,\r\n          Glides the gilt landau o’er the velvet lawn,\r\n          Of beaux and belles displays the glittering throng,\r\n          And soft airs fan them as they glide along”.\r\n\r\nFootnote 212:\r\n\r\nVer. 38. _Angle_—Gratus puellæ risus ab Angulo.—_Hor._\r\n\r\nFootnote 213:\r\n\r\nVer. 39. _How slow progressive Points_—The Author has reserved the\r\npicturesque imagery which the _theory of fluxions_ naturally suggested\r\nfor his “Algebraic Garden,” where the _fluents_ are described as rolling\r\nwith an even current between a margin of _curves_ of the higher order\r\nover a pebbly channel, inlaid with _differential calculi_.\r\n\r\nIn the following six lines he has confined himself to a strict\r\nexplanation of the theory, according to which lines are supposed to be\r\ngenerated by the motion of points, planes by the lateral motion of\r\nlines, and solids from planes, by a similar process.\r\n\r\n_Quære_—Whether a practical application of this theory would not enable\r\nus to account for the genesis or original formation of space itself, in\r\nthe same manner in which Dr. Darwin has traced the whole of the\r\norganized creation to his six filaments—Vide _Zoonomia_. We may conceive\r\nthe whole of our present universe to have been originally concentred in\r\na single point; we may conceive this primeval point, or _punctum\r\nsaliens_ of the universe, evolving itself by its own energies, to have\r\nmoved forward in a right line, _ad infinitum_, till it grew tired; after\r\nwhich the right line which it had generated would begin to put itself in\r\nmotion in a lateral direction, describing an area of infinite extent.\r\nThis area, as soon as it became conscious of its own existence, would\r\nbegin to ascend or descend, according as its specific gravity might\r\ndetermine it, forming an immense solid space filled with vacuum, and\r\ncapable of containing the present existing universe.\r\n\r\nSpace being thus obtained, and presenting a suitable nidus, or\r\nreceptacle for the generation of chaotic matter, an immense deposit of\r\nit would gradually be accumulated; after which, the filament of _fire_\r\nbeing produced in the chaotic mass by an _idiosyncrasy_, or self-formed\r\nhabit, analogous to fermentation, _explosion_ would take place; _suns_\r\nwould be shot from the central chaos; _planets_ from _suns_; and\r\n_satellites_ from _planets_. In this state of things the filament of\r\n_organization_ would begin to exert itself in those independent masses\r\nwhich, in proportion to their bulk, exposed the greatest surface to the\r\naction of _light_ and _heat_. This filament, after an infinite series of\r\nages, would begin to _ramify_, and its viviparous offspring would\r\ndiversify their forms and habits, so as to accommodate themselves to the\r\nvarious _incunabula_ which Nature had prepared for them. Upon this view\r\nof things it seems highly probable that the first effort of Nature\r\nterminated in the production of vegetables, and that these, being\r\nabandoned to their own _energies_, by degrees detached themselves from\r\nthe surface of the earth, and supplied themselves with wings or feet,\r\naccording as their different propensities determined them in favour of\r\naerial and terrestrial existence. Others, by an inherent disposition to\r\nsociety and civilization, and by a stronger effort of _volition_, would\r\nbecome men. These, in time, would restrict themselves to the use of\r\ntheir _hind feet_; their _tails_ would gradually rub off by sitting in\r\ntheir caves or huts, as soon as they arrived at a domesticated state;\r\nthey would invent _language_ and the use of _fire_, with our present and\r\nhitherto imperfect system of _society_. In the meanwhile, the _Fuci_ and\r\n_Algæ_, with the _Corallines_ and _Madrepores_, would transform\r\nthemselves into _fish_, and would gradually populate all the submarine\r\nportion of the globe.\r\n\r\nFootnote 214:\r\n\r\nVer. 46. _Trochais_—The Nymph of the Wheel, supposed to be in love with\r\nSmoke-Jack.\r\n\r\nFootnote 215:\r\n\r\nVer. 56. _The conscious fire_—The sylphs and genii of the different\r\nelements have a variety of innocent occupations assigned them; those of\r\nfire are supposed to divert themselves with writing _Kunkel_ in\r\nphosphorus.—See _Economy of Vegetation_:\r\n\r\n            “Or mark, with shining letters, Kunkel’s name\r\n            In the pale _phosphor’s_ self-consuming flame”.\r\n\r\nFootnote 216:\r\n\r\nVer. 68. _Listening ears_—Listening, and therefore peculiarly suited to\r\na pair of diamond ear-rings. See the description of Nebuchadnezzar in\r\nhis transformed state—\r\n\r\n          “Nor flattery’s self can pierce his _pendent ears_”.\r\n\r\nIn poetical diction, a person is said to “_breathe the_ BLUE _air_,” and\r\nto “_drink the_ HOARSE _wave_!”—not that the colour of the sky or the\r\nnoise of the water has any reference to drinking or breathing, but\r\nbecause the poet obtains the advantage of thus describing his subject\r\nunder a _double relation_, in the same manner in which material objects\r\npresent themselves to our different senses at the same time.\r\n\r\nFootnote 217:\r\n\r\nVer. 73. _Cock-tailed mice_—Coctilibus Muris. _Ovid._—There is reason to\r\nbelieve that the _murine_, or _mouse_ species, were anciently much more\r\nnumerous than at the present day. It appears from the sequel of the\r\nline, that Semiramis surrounded the city of Babylon with a number of\r\nthese animals.\r\n\r\n                                     _Dicitur altam\r\n              Coctilibus Muris cinxisse Semiramis urbem._\r\n\r\nIt is not easy at present to form any conjecture with respect to the\r\nend, whether of ornament or defence, which they could be supposed to\r\nanswer. I should be inclined to believe, that in this instance the mice\r\nwere dead, and that so vast a collection of them must have been\r\nfurnished by way of tribute, to free the country from these destructive\r\nanimals. This superabundance of the _murine_ race must have been owing\r\nto their immense fecundity, and to the comparatively tardy reproduction\r\nof the _feline_ species. The traces of this disproportion are to be\r\nfound in the early history of every country.—The ancient laws of Wales\r\nestimate a cat at the price of as much corn as would be sufficient to\r\ncover her, if she were suspended by the tail with her fore-feet touching\r\nthe ground.—See Howel Dha.—In Germany, it is recorded that an army of\r\nrats, a larger animal of the mus tribe, was employed as the ministers of\r\ndivine vengeance against a feudal tyrant; and the commercial legend of\r\nour own Whittington might probably be traced to an equally authentic\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nFootnote 218:\r\n\r\nVer. 76. _Rectangle_—“A figure which has one angle, or more, of ninety\r\ndegrees”. _Johnson’s Dictionary._—It here means a right-angled triangle,\r\nwhich is therefore incapable of having more than one angle of ninety\r\ndegrees, but which may, according to our author’s _Prosopopœia_, be\r\nsupposed to be in love with three, or any greater number of nymphs.\r\n\r\nFootnote 219:\r\n\r\nVer. 80. _Plato’s and Menecmus’ lore_—Proclus attributes the discovery\r\nof the conic sections to Plato, but obscurely. Eratosthenes seems to\r\nadjudge it to Menecmus. “_Neque Menecmeos necesse erit in cono secare\r\nternarios._” (Vide _Montucla_.) From Greece they were carried to\r\nAlexandria, where (according to our author’s beautiful fiction)\r\n_Rectangle_ either did or might learn magic.\r\n\r\nFootnote 220:\r\n\r\nVer. 86. _Zatanai_—Supposed to be the same with Satan.—Vide the _New\r\nArabian Nights_, translated by Cazotte, author of “_Le Diable\r\namoureux_”.\r\n\r\nFootnote 221:\r\n\r\nVer. 87. _Gins_—the Eastern name for Genii.—Vide _Tales of ditto_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 222:\r\n\r\nVer. 87. _Dom-Daniel_—a submarine palace near Tunis, where Zatanai\r\nusually held his court.—Vide _New Arabian Nights_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 223:\r\n\r\nVer. 88. _Sulphur_—A substance which, when cold, reflects the yellow\r\nrays, and is therefore said to be yellow. When raised to a temperature\r\nat which it _attracts oxygene_ (a process usually called _burning_), it\r\nemits a blue flame. This may be beautifully exemplified, and at a\r\nmoderate expense, by igniting those _fasciculi_ of brimstone _matches_,\r\nfrequently sold (so frequently, indeed, as to form one of the London\r\ncries) by women of an advanced age, in this metropolis. They will be\r\nfound to yield an _azure_, or blue light.\r\n\r\nFootnote 224:\r\n\r\nVer. 90. _Caf_—the Indian _Caucasus_.—Vide _Bailly’s Lettres sur\r\nl’Atlantide_, in which he proves that this was the native country of Gog\r\nand Magog (now resident in Guildhall), as well as of the Peris, or\r\nfairies, of the Asiatic romances.\r\n\r\nFootnote 225:\r\n\r\nVer. 91. _Judæa’s fabled king_—Mr. HIGGINS does not mean to deny that\r\nSolomon was really king of Judæa. The epithet _fabled_ applies to that\r\nempire over the Genii, which the retrospective generosity of the Arabian\r\nfabulists has bestowed upon this monarch.\r\n\r\nFootnote 226:\r\n\r\nVer. 96. _Young volcanoes_—The genesis of burning mountains was never,\r\ntill lately, well explained. Those with which we are best acquainted are\r\ncertainly not viviparous; it is therefore probable, that there exists,\r\nin the centre of the earth, a considerable reservoir of their eggs,\r\nwhich, during the obstetrical convulsions of general earthquakes,\r\nproduce new volcanoes.\r\n\r\nFootnote 227:\r\n\r\nVer. 100. _Far-extended heel_—The personification of _Rectangle_,\r\nbesides answering a poetical purpose, was necessary to illustrate Mr.\r\nHIGGINS’S philosophical opinions. The ancient mathematicians conceived\r\nthat a cone was generated by the revolution of a triangle; but this, as\r\nour author justly observes, would be impossible, without supposing in\r\nthe triangle that _expansive nisus_, discovered by Blumenbach, and\r\nimproved by Darwin, which is peculiar to animated matter, and which\r\nalone explains the whole mystery of organization. Our enchanter sits on\r\nthe ground, with his heels stretched out, his head erect, his wand (or\r\n_hypothenuse_) resting on the extremities of his feet and the tip of his\r\nnose (as is finely expressed in the engraving in the original work), and\r\nrevolves upon his bottom with great velocity. His skin, by magical\r\nmeans, has acquired an indefinite power of expansion, as well as that of\r\nassimilating to itself all the _azote_ of the air, which he decomposes\r\nby expiration from his lungs—an immense quantity, and which, in our\r\npresent unimproved and uneconomical mode of breathing, is quite thrown\r\naway. By this simple process the transformation is very naturally\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\nFootnote 228:\r\n\r\nVer. 104. _Phœnician Cone_—It was under this shape that Venus was\r\nworshipped in Phœnicia.

THOMAS BEDDOES, born at Shiffnal in 1760, was a scientific\r\nPhysician far in advance of his age; his _Popular Essay on Consumption_,\r\n1779, his tracts entitled _Hygeia_, 1801, &c., may still be studied with\r\nprofit. He paid particular attention to the medical use of the\r\npermanently Elastic Fluids, and avows that as “one rash experiment on a\r\npatient would demolish a plan on which the hope of relieving mankind\r\nfrom much of their misery is founded,” he made preliminary experiments\r\non himself in the case of _Oxygene_ and _Consumption_, as alluded to in\r\nthe text, _À propos_ of the artificial distribution of disease, it may\r\nbe mentioned that in _The Batchelor_, p. 189, is a method for\r\n“discharging the Plague”.\r\n\r\nHe wrote much on the political topics of the day, always taking the\r\nliberal side, and attacking PITT with great virulence and eloquence. The\r\nprinciples of the French Revolution were at first advocated by him with\r\nthe utmost enthusiasm, but he was soon disgusted by the excesses\r\ncommitted. He was a student of German literature, and much admired by\r\nImmanuel Kant. He was also an intimate friend of Darwin’s, whose\r\npolitical opinions he shared, and whose works were intrusted to his\r\nrevision in manuscript. A few months after the publication of Darwin’s\r\n_Botanic Garden_, its magnificent imagery and harmonious versification\r\ninspired some admirers to say that the style of this work was a style\r\n_sui generis_, and that it defied imitation. Dr. Beddoes maintained an\r\nopposite opinion. Much as he admired the poem in question, he thought\r\nthat the Darwinian structure of verse might be imitated by a writer\r\npossessed of inferior poetical powers, and in a few days he produced in\r\nthe same circle part of the manuscript of _Alexander’s Expedition to the\r\nIndian Ocean_ as an unpublished work of the author of the _Botanic\r\nGarden_. The deception completely succeeded, and some enthusiastic\r\nadmirers of the latter work pointed out with triumph “certain passages\r\nas proofs of the position that the author in his happier efforts defied\r\nimitation”. Beddoes’s success was the more extraordinary, as in the\r\n“Introduction” to a considerable extract from his poem which he printed\r\nin the _Annual Anthology_ for 1796, he states that he had never before\r\nwritten twice as many lines of verse as the composition under notice\r\nconsisted of.\r\n\r\nAs BEDDOES’S imitation of DARWIN is seldom met with, it may not be out\r\nof character in a work of the present nature to give a specimen of it.\r\n\r\n                        AN IMITATION OF DARWIN.\r\n\r\n          “Now the new Lord of Persia’s wide domain,\r\n          Down fierce Hydaspes seeks the Indian main;\r\n          High on the leading prow the Conqueror stands,\r\n          Eyes purer skies and marks diverging strands.\r\n          A thousand sails attendant catch the wind,\r\n          And yet a thousand press the wave behind;\r\n          Two veteran hosts, outstretched on either hand,\r\n          Wide wave their wings and sweep the trembling land.\r\n          Each serried phalanx Terror stalks beside,\r\n          And shakes o’er crested helms his blazing pride;\r\n          While Victory, still companion of his way,\r\n          Sounds her loud trump and flaunts her banners gay.”\r\n\r\nFurther on, the Hero’s attention is attracted to the surrounding\r\nlandscape, which he thus apostrophizes:—\r\n\r\n           “Ye fields for ever fair! Thou mighty stream!\r\n           Bright regions! blessed beyond the muse’s dream!\r\n           Thou fruitful womb of ever-teeming earth!\r\n           Ye fostering skies that rear each beauteous birth!\r\n           Trees, that aloft uprear your stately height,\r\n           Whose sombrous branches shed a noontide night!\r\n           Groves, that for ever wear the smile of spring!\r\n           Gay birds that wave the many-tinted wing!\r\n           Of reptiles, fishes, brutes, stupendous forms!\r\n           And ye, of nameless insects glittering swarms!\r\n           Sons of soft toil, whose shuttle beauty throws,\r\n           Whose tints the Graces’ earnest hands dispose,\r\n           Whose guileless bosom Care avoid and Crime,\r\n           Gay as your groves, and cloudless as your clime!\r\n           Primæval piles, that rose in massive pride,\r\n           Ere Western Art her first faint efforts tried!\r\n           Ye Brachmans old, whom purer æras bore,\r\n           Ere Western Science lisped her infant lore!\r\n           How will your wonders flush the Athenian sage?\r\n           How ray with glory my historic page?”\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Hannah More, Horace Walpole says: “The poetry is most\r\nadmirable; the similes beautiful, fine, and sometimes sublime; the\r\nauthor is a great poet, and could raise the passions, and possesses all\r\nthe requisites of the art.” In another lively epistle to the Misses\r\nBerry (28th April, 1789), he says: “I send you the most delicious poem\r\nupon earth. I can read this Second Part over and over again for ever;\r\nfor though it is so excellent, it is impossible to remember anything so\r\ndisjointed, except you consider it as a collection of short enchanting\r\nPoems. ‘The Triumph of Flora,’ beginning at the fifty-ninth line, is\r\nmost beautifully and enchantingly imagined, and the twelve verses that\r\nby miracle describe and comprehend the creation of the universe out of\r\nchaos, are, in my opinion, the most sublime passage in any author, or in\r\nany of the few languages with which I am acquainted.”—ED.]\r\n\r\n[Darwin was acquainted with Rousseau. He was a man of great bodily and\r\nintellectual vigour, irascible and imperious, a strong advocate of\r\ntemperance, and for many years an almost total abstainer. His\r\nprofessional fame was such that George III. said he would take him as\r\nhis physician if he would come to London. He formed a botanical garden\r\nat Lichfield, about which Miss Seward wrote some verses which suggested\r\nhis _Botanic Garden_. The _Loves of the Plants_ had a singular success,\r\nand was praised in a joint poem by Cowper and Hayley. It was translated\r\ninto French, Portuguese, and Italian. Darwin himself is said by\r\nEdgeworth to have admired the parody (_Monthly Magazine_, June and\r\nSept., 1802, p. 115). Coleridge (_Biographia Literaria_, 1817, p. 19)\r\nspeaks of the impression which it made even upon good judges.\r\n\r\nIn the _Anti-Jacobin Review_, vol. i. (1799), pp. 718–721, appear some\r\nLatin verses [by Ben. Frere] which are thus introduced: “Among the\r\ncopies of verses which are annually produced as a public exercise called\r\nTRIPOS, at Cambridge, we have selected the following as a beautiful\r\ncomposition.

He took occasion to praise the loyalty of his own tenants at\r\nBALLYNAHINCH; but, unfortunately for him, shortly after, an insurrection\r\nbroke out at this very place, and a large number of pikes were found\r\nsecreted by the peasantry in his own woods.

The attempt at self-slaughter, and the process of\r\nthe recovery, the arsenic and the castor oil, were served up in daily\r\nmesses from the French papers, till the public absolutely sickened.\r\n\r\nFootnote 318:\r\n\r\n_Faciles Napeæ._\r\n\r\nFootnote 319:\r\n\r\nSee Anthologia, _passim_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 320:\r\n\r\nSuch was the strictness of this minister’s principles, that he\r\npositively refused to go to Court in shoe-buckles. See Dumouriez’s\r\n_Memoirs_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 321:\r\n\r\nSee MADAME ROLAND’S _Memoirs_.—“_Rigide Ministre_,” _Brissot à ses\r\nCommettans_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 322:\r\n\r\nThe “pumple” nosed attorney of Furnival’s Inn.—“Congreve’s _Way of the\r\nWorld_.” [... When you liv’d with honest _Pumple Nose_, the attorney of\r\nFurnival’s Inn. Act 3, sc. 1.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 323:\r\n\r\nThese lines contain the Secret History of QUATREMER’S deportation. He\r\npresumed in the Council of Five Hundred to arraign MADAME DE STAEL’S\r\nconduct, and even to hint a doubt of her sex. He was sent to _Guyana_.\r\nThe transaction naturally brings to one’s mind the dialogue between\r\nFalstaff and Hostess Quickly in Shakespeare’s Henry IV.\r\n\r\n_Fal._ Thou art neither fish nor flesh—a man cannot tell where to have\r\nthee.\r\n\r\n_Quick._ Thou art an unjust man for saying so—thou or any man knows\r\nwhere to have me.\r\n\r\nFootnote 324:\r\n\r\nFor instance, in the course of a political discussion REWBELL observed\r\nto the EX-BISHOP [TALLEYRAND], “_that his understanding was as crooked\r\nas his legs_”—“Vil Emigré, tu n’as pas le sens plus droit que les\r\npieds”—and therewith threw an ink-stand at him. It whizzed along, as we\r\nhave been informed, like the fragment of a rock from the hand of one of\r\nOssian’s heroes; but the wily apostate shrunk beneath the table, and the\r\nweapon passed over him innocuous, and guiltless of his blood or brains.\r\n\r\nFootnote 325:\r\n\r\nSee Homer’s description of Vulcan. First Iliad.\r\n\r\n        Inextinguibilis vero exoriebatur risus beatis numinibus\r\n        Ut viderunt Vulcanum per domos _ministrantem_.\r\n\r\nFootnote 326:\r\n\r\n_The Men without a God_—one of the new sects. Their religion is intended\r\nto consist in the adoration of a Great Book, in which all the virtuous\r\nactions of the society are to be entered and registered. “In times of\r\ncivil commotion they are to come forward to exhort the citizens to\r\nunanimity, and to read them a chapter out of the Great Book. When\r\noppressed or proscribed, they are to retire to a burying-ground, to wrap\r\nthemselves up in their great-coats, and wait the approach of death,” &c.\r\n\r\nFootnote 327:\r\n\r\nThe Reader is at liberty to fill up the blanks according to his own\r\nopinion, and after the chances and changes of the times. It would be\r\nhighly unfair to hand down to posterity as followers of _Leviathan_, the\r\nnames of men who may, and probably will soon, grow ashamed of their\r\nleader.\r\n\r\nFootnote 328:\r\n\r\n                  Though the _yeasty_ sea\r\n            Consume and swallow navigation up.    _Macbeth._\r\n\r\n[Applied to S. Whitbread, M.P., _the Brewer_.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 329:\r\n\r\n_i.e._ Perhaps _a member of the_ WHIG CLUB—a society that has presumed\r\nto monopolize to itself a title to which it never had any claim, but\r\nfrom the character of those who have now withdrawn themselves from it.\r\n“_Perhaps_” signifies that _even_ the WHIG CLUB _sometimes_ rejects a\r\ncandidate whose PRINCIPLES (_risum teneatis_) it affects to disapprove.\r\n[Referring to the secession of the DUKE OF PORTLAND and others from the\r\nWhig Club in consequence of their not approving of all the proceedings\r\nof Fox and his more violent adherents. SHERIDAN met with so much\r\nopposition to his entrance into the Whig Club, that he succeeded in\r\ngetting admitted only by stratagem.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 330:\r\n\r\n“It is notorious that the _French Directory have newspapers in their\r\npay_, not only in America, but in _every_ country in Europe. That there\r\nshould exist such MERCENARY TRAITORS AS TO RECEIVE THE PAY OF REGICIDES\r\nAND ASSASSINS is still less astonishing than that there should be found\r\nmen in the different countries, and _men of rank_, too, so base, so\r\ndegenerate, and so _foolish_, as to give encouragement to their\r\ntreasonable productions” (p. 57). The author speaks truth; there is at\r\nleast _one_ newspaper of this description in _London_, which is\r\nencouraged—to their shame be it spoken!—by _men of rank_, and by members\r\nof the Legislature—_Representans du Peuple Souverain!_—who even degrade\r\nthemselves so far as to associate with the profligate miscreants who\r\ncompose its inflammatory pages.—REVIEWER.\r\n\r\nFootnote 331:\r\n\r\n“See BACHE of 11 February, 1795.”\r\n\r\nFootnote 332:\r\n\r\nThe reader will not be surprised to hear that this is the identical\r\ngovernor who wanted a few thousands of dollars from the French minister,\r\nFAUCHET, and who drew _secretly_ 15,000 dollars out of the Bank of\r\nPennsylvania!! This man brought a whole litter of _bastards_ home to his\r\nvirtuous wife. He is a shameless blackguard, a drunkard, and everything\r\nthat can be named that is vile. Such is a _republican governor_; a chief\r\nmagistrate of state, who has infinitely greater powers over life and\r\nproperty than King George has!! And this I have already pointed out on\r\nsundry occasions.\r\n\r\nFootnote 333:\r\n\r\n[Lord Erskine.—ED.]\r\n\r\nFootnote 334:\r\n\r\n[T.
