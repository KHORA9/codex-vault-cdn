Baker_, at the _Black Boy_ in\r\n_Pater-Noster-Row_. 1713. [_Price 6d._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAND WHAT IF THE PRETENDER SHOULD COME?\r\n\r\nOR SOME CONSIDERATIONS, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the danger of the pretender is really so great as the noise which\r\nsome make about it seems to suppose, if the hopes of his coming are so\r\nwell grounded, as some of his friends seem to boast, it behoves us who\r\nare to be the subjects of the approaching revolution, which his\r\nsuccess must necessarily bring with it, to apply ourselves seriously\r\nto examine what our part will be in the play, that so we may prepare\r\nourselves to act as becomes us, both with respect to the government we\r\nare now under, and with respect to the government we may be under,\r\nwhen the success he promises himself shall (if ever it shall) answer\r\nhis expectation.\r\n\r\nIn order to this it is necessary to state, with what plainness the\r\ncircumstances of the case will admit, the several appearances of the\r\nthing itself. 1. As they are offered to us by the respective parties\r\nwho are for or against it. 2. As they really appear by an impartial\r\ndeduction from them both, without the least bias either to one side or\r\nother; that so the people of Britain may settle and compose their\r\nthoughts a little in this great, and at present popular, debate; and\r\nmay neither be terrified nor affrighted with mischiefs, which have no\r\nreason nor foundation in them, and which give no ground for their\r\napprehensions; and, on the other hand, may not promise to themselves\r\ngreater things from the pretender, if he should come hither, than he\r\nwill be able to perform for them. In order to this we are to consider\r\nthe pretender in his person and in his circumstances. 1. The person\r\nwho we call the pretender; it has been so much debated, and such\r\nstrong parties have been made on both sides to prove or disprove the\r\nlegitimacy of his birth, that it seems needless here to enter into\r\nthat dispute; the author of the Review, one of the most furious\r\nopposers of the name and interest of the pretender, openly grants his\r\nlegitimacy, and pretends to argue against his admission from\r\nprinciples and foundations of his own forming; we shall let alone his\r\nprinciples and foundations here, as we do his arguments, and only take\r\nhim by the handle which he fairly gives us, viz., that he grants the\r\nperson of the pretender legitimate; if this be so, if the person we\r\ncontend about be the lawful true son of King James's queen, the\r\ndispute whether he be the real son of the king will be quite out of\r\nthe question; because by the laws of Great Britain, and of the whole\r\nworld, a child born in wedlock shall inherit, as heir of the mother's\r\nhusband, whether begotten by him, as his real father, or not. Now to\r\ncome at the true design of this work, the business is, to hear, as\r\nabove, what either side have to say to this point. The friends of his\r\nbirth and succession argue upon it thus, if the person be lawfully\r\nbegotten, that is, if born really of the body of the queen dowager,\r\nduring the life of King James, he was without any exception his lawful\r\nson; if he was his lawful son, he was his lawful heir; if he was his\r\nlawful heir, why is he not our lawful king? Since hereditary right is\r\nindefeasible, and is lately acknowledged to be so; and that the\r\ndoctrine of hereditary right being indefeasible, is a Church of\r\nEngland doctrine ever received by the church, and inseparable from the\r\ntrue members of the church, the contrary being the stigmatizing\r\ncharacter of republicans, king-killers, enemies to monarchy,\r\npresbyterians, and fanatics. The enemies of the birth and succession\r\nof the person called the pretender argue upon it thus, that he is the\r\nlawfully begotten, or son born really of the body of the queen dowager\r\nof the late King James, they doubt; and they are justified in doubting\r\nof it, because no sufficient steps were taken in the proper season of\r\nit, either before his birth, to convince such persons as were more\r\nimmediately concerned, to know the truth of it, that the queen was\r\nreally with child, which might have been done past all contradiction\r\nat that time, more than ever after; or at his birth, to have such\r\npersons as were more immediately concerned, such as her present\r\nmajesty, &c., thoroughly convinced of the queen being really delivered\r\nof a child, by being present at the time of the queen's labour and\r\ndelivery. This being omitted, which was the affirmative, say they,\r\nwhich ought to have been proved, we ought not to be concerned in the\r\nproof of the negative, which by the nature of the thing could not be\r\nequally certain; and therefore we might be justly permitted to\r\nconclude that the child was a spurious, unfair production, put upon\r\nthe nation; for which reason we reject him, and have now, by a legal\r\nand just authority, deposed his father and him, and settled the\r\nsuccession upon the house of Hanover, being protestants.\r\n\r\nThe matter of his title standing thus, divides the nation into two\r\nparties, one side for, and the other against the succession, either of\r\nthe pretender, or the house of Hanover, and either side calling the\r\nother the pretender; so that if we were to use the party's language,\r\nwe must say, one side is for, and the other side against, either of\r\nthe pretenders; what the visible probabilities of either of these\r\nclaims succeeding are, is not the present case; the nation appears at\r\nthis time strangely agitated between the fears of one party, and the\r\nhopes of the other, each extenuating and aggravating, as their several\r\nparties and affections guide them, by which the public disorder is\r\nvery much increased; what either of them have to allege is our present\r\nwork to inquire; but more particularly what are the real or pretended\r\nadvantages of the expected reign of him, who we are allowed to\r\ndistinguish by the name of the pretender; for his friends here would\r\nhave very little to say to move us to receive him, it they were not\r\nable to lay before us such prospects of national advantages, and such,\r\nviews of prosperity, as would be sufficient to prevail with those who\r\nhave their eyes upon the good of their country, and of their posterity\r\nafter them.\r\n\r\nThat then a case so popular, and of so much consequence as this is,\r\nmay not want such due supports as the nature of the thing will allow,\r\nand especially since the advantages and good consequences of the thing\r\nitself are so many, and so easy to be seen as his friends allege; why\r\nshould not the good people of Britain be made easy, and their fears be\r\nturned into peaceable satisfaction, by seeing that this devil may not\r\nbe so black as he is painted; and that the noise made of the\r\npretender, and the frightful things said of his coming, and of his\r\nbeing received here, may not be made greater scarecrows to us than\r\nthey really are; and after all that has been said, if it should appear\r\nthat the advantages of the pretender's succession are really greater\r\nto us, and the dangers less to us, than those of the succession of\r\nHanover, then much of their difficulties would be over, who, standing\r\nneuter as to persons, appear against the pretender, only because they\r\nare made to believe strange and terrible things of what shall befall\r\nthe nation in case of his coming in, such as popery, slavery, French\r\npower, destroying of our credit, and devouring our funds (as that\r\nscandalous scribbler, the Review, has been labouring to suggest), with\r\nmany other things which we shall endeavour to expose to you, as they\r\ndeserve. If, we say, it should appear then that the dangers and\r\ndisadvantages of the pretender's succession are less than those of the\r\nhouse of Hanover, who, because of an act of Parliament, you know must\r\nnot be called pretenders, then there will remain nothing more to be\r\nsaid on that score, but the debate must be of the reasonableness and\r\njustice on either side, for their admittance; and there we question\r\nnot but the side we are really pleading for will have the advantage.\r\n\r\nTo begin, then, with that most popular and affrighting argument now\r\nmade use of, as the bugbear of the people, against several other\r\nthings besides jacobitism, we mean French greatness. It is most\r\nevident that the fear of this must, by the nature of the thing, be\r\neffectually removed upon our receiving the pretender; the grounds and\r\nreasons why French greatness is rendered formidable to us, and so much\r\nweight supposed to be in it, that like the name of Scanderberg, we\r\nfright our very children with it, lie only in this, that we suggest\r\nthe king of France being a professed enemy to the peace and the\r\nliberty of Great Britain, will most certainly, as soon as he can a\r\nlittle recover himself, exercise all that formidable power to put the\r\npretender upon us, and not only to place him upon the throne of Great\r\nBritain, but to maintain and hold him up in it, against all the\r\nopposition, either of the people of Britain or the confederate princes\r\nleagued with the elector of Hanover, who are in the interest of his\r\nclaim, or of his party. Now, it is evident, that upon a peaceable\r\nadmitting this person, whom they call the pretender, to receive and\r\nenjoy the crown here, all that formidable power becomes your friend,\r\nand the being so must necessarily take off from it everything that is\r\ncalled terrible; forasmuch as the greater terror and amusement the\r\npower we apprehend really carries with it, the greater is the\r\ntranquillity and satisfaction which accrues to us, when we have the\r\nfriendship of that power which was so formidable to us before: the\r\npower of France is represented at this time very terrible, and the\r\nwriters who speak of it apply it warm to our imaginations, as that\r\nfrom whence we ought justly to apprehend the impossibility of keeping\r\nout the pretender, and this, notwithstanding they allow themselves at\r\nthe same time to suppose all the confederate powers of Europe to be\r\nengaged, as well by their own interest, as by the new treaties of\r\nbarrier and guarantee, to support and to assist the claim of the\r\nelector of Hanover, and his party. Now, if this power be so great and\r\nso formidable, as they allege, will it not, on the other side, add a\r\nproportion of increase to our satisfaction, that this power will be\r\nwholly in friendship and league with us; and engaged to concern itself\r\nfor the quieting our fears of other foreign invaders; forasmuch as\r\nhaving once concerned itself to set the person of the pretender upon\r\nthe throne, it cannot be supposed but it shall be equally concerned to\r\nsupport and maintain him in that possession, as what will mightily\r\nconduce to the carrying on the other projects of his greatness and\r\nglory with the rest of Europe; in which it will be very much his\r\ninterest to secure himself from any opposition he might meet with from\r\nthis nation, or from such as might be rendered powerful by our\r\nassistance. An eminent instance we have of this in the mighty efforts\r\nthe French nation have made for planting, and preserving when planted,\r\na grandson of France upon the throne of Spain; and how eminent are the\r\nadvantages to France from the success of that undertaking; of what\r\nless consequence then would it be to the august monarchy of France, to\r\nsecure and engage to himself the constant friendship and assistance of\r\nthe power of Great Britain, which he would necessarily do, by the\r\nplacing this person upon the throne, who would thereby in gratitude be\r\nengaged to contribute his utmost in return to the king of France, for\r\nthe carrying on his glorious designs in the rest of Europe. While,\r\nthen, we become thus necessary to the king of France, reason dictates\r\nthat he would be our fast friend, our constant confederate, our ally,\r\nfirmly engaged to secure our sovereign, and protect our people from\r\nthe insults and attempts of all the world; being thus engaged\r\nreciprocally with the king of France, there must necessarily be an end\r\nof all the fears and jealousies, of all the apprehensions and doubts,\r\nwhich now so amuse us, and appear so formidable to us from the\r\nprospect of the power and greatness of France; then we shall on the\r\ncontrary say to the world, the stronger the king of France is, the\r\nbetter for the king of England; and what is best for the king, must be\r\nso for his people; for it is a most unnatural way of arguing, to\r\nsuppose the interest of a king, and of his people, to be different\r\nfrom one another.\r\n\r\nAnd is not this then an advantage incomparably greater to Britain,\r\nwhen the pretender shall be upon the throne, than any we can propose\r\nto ourselves in the present uneasy posture of affairs, which it must\r\nbe acknowledged we are in now, when we cannot sleep in quiet, for the\r\nterrible apprehensions of being overrun by the formidable power of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nLet us also consider the many other advantages which may accrue to\r\nthis nation, by a nearer conjunction, and closer union with France,\r\nsuch as increase of commerce, encouragement of manufactures, balance\r\nof trade; every one knows how vast an advantage we reaped by the\r\nFrench trade in former times, and how many hundred thousand pounds a\r\nyear we gained by it, when the balance of trade between us and France\r\nran so many millions of livres annually _against_ the French by the\r\nvast exportation of our goods to them, and the small import which we\r\nreceived from them again, and by the constant flux of money in specie,\r\nwhich we drew from them every year, upon court occasions, to the\r\ninexpressible benefit of the nation, and enriching of the subject, of\r\nwhich we shall have occasion to speak hereafter more fully.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it were to be wished that our people who are so\r\nbugbeared with words, and terrified with the name of French, French\r\npower, French greatness, and the like, as if England could not\r\nsubsist, and the queen of England was not able to keep upon her throne\r\nany longer than the king of France pleased, and that her majesty was\r\ngoing to be a mere servant to the French king, would consider that\r\nthis is an unanswerable argument for the coming of the pretender, that\r\nwe may make this so formidable prince our friend, have all his power\r\nengaged in our interest, and see him going on hand in hand with us, in\r\nthe securing us against all sorts of encroachments whatsoever; for if\r\nthe king of France be such an invincible mighty monarch, that we are\r\nnothing in his eyes or in his hands; and that neither Britain, or all\r\nthe friends Britain can make, are able to deliver us from him; then it\r\nmust be our great advantage to have the pretender be our king, that\r\nwe may be out of the danger of this formidable French power being our\r\nenemy; and that, on the other hand, we may have so potent, so\r\npowerful, so invincible a prince be our friend. The case is evidently\r\nlaid down to every common understanding, in the example of Spain; till\r\nnow, the Spaniards for many ages have been overrun and impoverished by\r\ntheir continued wars with the French, and it was not doubted but one\r\ntime or other they would have been entirely conquered by the king of\r\nFrance, and have become a mere province of France; whereas now, having\r\nbut consented to receive a king from the hands of the invincible\r\nmonarch, they are made easy as to the former danger they were always\r\nin, axe now most safe under the protection of France; and he who\r\nbefore was their terror, is now their safety, and being safe from him\r\nit appears they are so from all the world.\r\n\r\nWould it not then be the manifest advantage of this nation to be\r\nlikewise secured from the dangerous power of France, and make that\r\npotentate our fast friend, who it is so apparent we are not able to\r\nresist as an enemy? This is reducing the French power the softest way,\r\nif not the best and shortest way; for if it does not reduce the power\r\nitself, it brings it into such a circumstance, as that all the terror\r\nof it is removed, and we embrace that as our safety and satisfaction,\r\nwhich really is, and ought to be, our terror and aversion; this must\r\nof necessity be our great advantage.\r\n\r\nHow strange is it that none of our people have yet thought of this way\r\nof securing their native country from the insults of France? Were but\r\nthe pretender once received as our king, we have no more disputes with\r\nthe king of France, he has no pretence to invade or disturb us; what a\r\nquiet world would it be with us in such a case, when the greatest\r\nmonarch in the universe should be our fast friend, and be in our\r\ninterest to prevent any of the inconveniences which might happen to us\r\nfrom the disgust of other neighbours, who may be dissatisfied with us\r\nupon other accounts. As to the terrible things which some people\r\nfright us, and themselves with, from the influence which French\r\ncouncils may have upon us, and of French methods of government being\r\nintroduced among us; these we ought to esteem only clamours and noise,\r\nraised by a party to amuse and affright us; for pray let us inquire a\r\nlittle into them, and see if there be any reason for us to be so\r\nterrified at them; suppose they were really what is alleged, which we\r\nhope they are not; for example, the absolute dominion of the king of\r\nFrance over his subjects, is such, say our people, as makes them\r\nmiserable; well, but let us examine then, are we not already miserable\r\nfor want of this absolute dominion? Are we not miserably divided? Is\r\nnot our government miserably weak? Are we not miserably subjected to\r\nthe rabbles and mob? Nay, is not the very crown mobbed here every now\r\nand then, into whatever our sovereign lord the people demand? Whereas,\r\non the contrary, we see France entirely united as one man; no virulent\r\nscribblers there dare affront the government; no impertinent\r\np----ments there disturb the monarch with their addresses and\r\nrepresentations; no superiority of laws restrain the administration;\r\nno insolent lawyers talk of the sacred constitution, in opposition to\r\nthe more sacred prerogative; but all with harmony and general consent\r\nagree to support the majesty of their prince, and with their lives and\r\nfortunes; not in complimenting sham addresses only, but in reality,\r\nand effectually, support the glory of their great monarch. In doing\r\nthis they are all united together so firmly, as if they had but one\r\nheart and one mind, and that the king was the soul of the nation: what\r\nif they are what we foolishly call slaves to the absolute will of\r\ntheir prince? That slavery to them is mere liberty? They entertain no\r\nnotion of that foolish thing liberty, which we make so much noise\r\nabout; nor have they any occasion of it, or any use for it if they had\r\nit; they are as industrious in trade, as vigorous in pursuit of their\r\naffairs, go on with as much courage, and are as well satisfied when\r\nthey have wrought hard twenty or thirty years to get a little money\r\nfor the king to take away, as we are to get it for our wives and\r\nchildren; and as they plant vines, and plough lands, that the king and\r\nhis great men may eat the fruit thereof, they think it as great a\r\nfelicity as if they eat it themselves. The badge of their poverty,\r\nwhich we make such a noise of, and insult them about so much, viz.,\r\ntheir wooden shoes, their peasants make nothing of it; they say they\r\nare as happy in their wooden shoes, as our people are with their\r\nluxury and drunkenness; besides, do not our poor people wear iron\r\nshoes, and leather doublets, and where is the odds between them? All\r\nthe business, forsooth, is this trifle we call liberty, which rather\r\nthan be plagued with so much strife and dissension about it as we are,\r\nwho would be troubled with; now, it is evident _the peace_ and union\r\nwhich we should enjoy under the like methods of government here, which\r\nwe hope for under the happy government of the pretender, must needs be\r\na full equivalent for all the pretended rights and privileges which we\r\nsay we shall lose; and how will our rights and privileges be lost?\r\nWill they not rather be centred in our common receptacle, viz., the\r\nsovereign, who is, according to the king of France's happy government,\r\nthe common magazine of universal privilege, communicating it to, and\r\npreserving it for, the general use of his subjects, as their safety\r\nand happiness requires. Thus he protects their commerce, encourages\r\ntheir foreign settlements, enlarges their possessions abroad,\r\nincreases their manufactures, gives them room for spreading their\r\nnumerous race over the world; at home he rewards arts and sciences,\r\ncultivates learning, employs innumerable hands in the labours of the\r\nstate, and the like; what if it be true that all they gain is at his\r\nmercy? Does he take it away, except when needful, for the support of\r\nhis glory and grandeur, which is their protection? Is it not apparent,\r\nthat under all the oppressions they talk so much of, the French are\r\nthe nation the most improved and increased in manufactures, in\r\nnavigation, in commerce, within these fifty years, of any nation in\r\nthe world? And here we pretend liberty, property, constitutions,\r\nrights of subjects, and such stuff as that, and with all these fine\r\ngewgaws, which we pretend propagate trade, and increase the wealth of\r\nthe nation, we are every day declining, and become poor; how long will\r\nthis nation be blinded by their own foolish customs? And when will\r\nthey learn to know, that the absolute government of a virtuous prince,\r\nwho makes the good of his people his ultimate end, and esteems their\r\nprosperity his glory, is the best, and most godlike, government in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nLet us then be no more rendered uneasy with the notions, that with the\r\npretender we must entertain French methods of government, such as\r\ntyranny and arbitrary power; tyranny is no more tyranny, when improved\r\nfor the subjects' advantage: perhaps when we have tried it we may find\r\nit as much for our good many ways, nay, and more too, than our present\r\nexorbitant liberties, especially unless we can make a better use of\r\nthem, and enjoy them, without being always going by the ears about\r\nthem, as we see daily, not only with our governors, but even with one\r\nanother; a little French slavery, though it be a frightful word among\r\nus, that is, being made so by custom, yet may do us a great deal of\r\ngood in the main, as it may teach us not to over (under) value our\r\nliberties when we have them, so much as sometimes we have done; and\r\nthis is not one of the least advantages which we shall gain by the\r\ncoming of the pretender, and consequently one of the good reasons why\r\nwe should be very willing to receive him.\r\n\r\nThe next thing which they fill us with apprehensions of in the coming\r\nof the pretender, is the influence of French councils, which they\r\nconstrue thus, viz., That the pretender being restored here by the\r\nassistance of France, will not only rule us by French methods, viz.,\r\nby French tyranny, but in gratitude to his restorer he will cause us\r\nto be always ready with English blood and treasure to assist and\r\nsupport the French ambition in the invasions he will ever be making\r\nupon Europe, and in the oppressions of other nations; till at last he\r\nobtain the superiority over them all, and turn upon us too, devouring\r\nthe liberties of Europe in his so long purposed and resolved universal\r\nmonarchy. As to the gratitude of the pretender to the king of France,\r\nwhy should you make that a crime? Are not all people bound in honour\r\nto retaliate kindness? And would you have your prince be ungrateful to\r\nhim that brought him hither? By the same rule, you would expect he\r\ncould be ungrateful to us that receive him; besides, if it be so great\r\nan advantage to us to have him brought in, we shall be all concerned\r\nalso in gratitude to the king of France for helping us to him; and\r\nsure we shall not decline making a suitable return to him for the\r\nkindness; and is this anything more than common? Did we not pay the\r\nDutch six hundred thousand pounds sterling for assisting the late King\r\nWilliam? And did we not immediately embark with them in the war\r\nagainst the king of France? And has not that revolution cost the\r\nnation one hundred millions of British money to support it? And shall\r\nwe grudge to support the pretender and his benefactor, at the same\r\nexpense, if it should be needful, for carrying on the new scheme of\r\nFrench liberty, which when that time comes may be in a likely and\r\nforward way to prevail over the whole world, to the general happiness\r\nof Europe.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be but one thing more which those people, who make such\r\na clamour at the fears of the pretender, take hold of, and this is\r\nreligion; and they tell us that not only French government, and\r\nFrench influence, but French religion, that is to say, popery, will\r\ncome upon us; but these people know not what they talk of, for it is\r\nevident that they shall be so far from being loaded with religion,\r\nthat they will rather obtain that so long desired happiness, of having\r\nno religion at all. This we may easily make appear has been the\r\nadvantage which has been long laboured for in this nation; and as the\r\nattainments we are arrived to of that kind are very considerable\r\nalready, so we cannot doubt but that if once the pretender were\r\nsettled quietly among us, an absolute subjection, as well of religious\r\nprinciples, as civil liberties, to the disposal of the sovereign,\r\nwould take place. This is an advantage so fruitful of several other\r\nmanifest improvements, that though we have not room in this place to\r\nenlarge upon the particulars, we cannot doubt but it must be a most\r\ngrateful piece of news to a great part of the nation, who have long\r\ngroaned under the oppressions and cruel severities of the clergy,\r\noccasioned by their own strict lives, and rigorous virtue, and their\r\nimposing such austerities and restraints upon the people; and in this\r\nparticular the clamour of slavery will appear very scandalous in the\r\nnation, for the slavery of religion being taken off, and an universal\r\nfreedom of vice being introduced, what greater liberty can we enjoy.\r\n\r\nBut we have yet greater advantages attending this nation by the coming\r\nof the pretender than any we have yet taken notice of; and though we\r\nhave not room in this short tract to name them all, and enlarge upon\r\nthem as the case may require, yet we cannot omit such due notice of\r\nthem, as may serve to satisfy our readers, and convince them how much\r\nthey ought to favour the coming of the pretender, as the great benefit\r\nto the whole nation; and therefore we shall begin with our brethren of\r\nScotland; and here we may tell them, that they, of all the parts of\r\nthis island, shall receive the most evident advantages, in that the\r\nsetting the pretender upon the throne shall effectually set them free\r\nfrom the bondage they now groan under, in their abhorred subjection to\r\nEngland by the union, which may, no question, be declared void, and\r\ndissolved, as a violence upon the Scottish nation, as soon as ever the\r\npretender shall be established upon the throne; a few words may serve\r\nto recommend this to the Scots, since we are very well satisfied we\r\nshall be sure to oblige every side there by it: the opposition all\r\nsides made to the union at the time of the transaction of the union\r\nin the parliament there, cannot but give us reason to think thus; and\r\nthe present scruple, even the presbyterians themselves make, of taking\r\nthe abjuration, if they do not, as some pretend, assure us that the\r\nsaid presbyterian nonjurors are in the interest of the pretender, yet\r\nthey undeniably prove, and put it out of all question, that they are\r\nill-pleased with the yoke of the union, and would embrace every just\r\noccasion of being quietly and freely discharged from the fetters which\r\nthey believe they bear by the said union; now there is no doubt to be\r\nmade, but that upon the very first appearance of the pretender, the\r\nancient kingdom of Scotland should recover her former well-known\r\ncondition, we mean, of being perfectly free, and depending upon none\r\nbut the king of France. How inestimable an advantage this will be to\r\nScotland, and how effectually he will support and defend the Scots\r\nagainst their ancient enemies, the English, forasmuch as we have not\r\nroom to enlarge upon here, we may take occasion to make out more\r\nparticularly on another occasion. But it may not be forgotten here,\r\nthat the union was not only justly distasteful to the Scots\r\nthemselves, but also to many good men, and noble patriots of the\r\nchurch, some of whom entered their protests against passing and\r\nconfirming, or ratifying the same, such as the late Lord Hav----sham,\r\nand the right wise and right noble E---- of Nott----, whose reasons\r\nfor being against the said union, besides those they gave in the house\r\nof p----s, which we do by no means mean to reflect upon in the least\r\nin this place; we say, whose other reasons for opposing the said union\r\nwere founded upon an implacable hatred to the Scots kirk, which has\r\nbeen established thereby: it may then not admit of any question, but\r\nthat they would think it a very great advantage to be delivered from\r\nthe same, as they would effectually be by the coming of the pretender;\r\nwherefore by the concurring judgment of these noble and wise persons,\r\nwho on that account opposed the union, the coming of the pretender\r\nmust be an inexpressible advantage to this nation; nor is the\r\ndissolving the union so desirable a thing, merely as that union was an\r\nestablishing among us a wicked schismatical presbyterian generation,\r\nand giving the sanction of the laws to their odious constitution,\r\nwhich we esteem (you know) worse than popery; but even on civil\r\naccounts, as particularly on account of the p----s of Scotland, who\r\nmany of them think themselves egregiously maltreated, and robbed of\r\ntheir birthright, as p----s, and have expressed themselves so in a\r\nsomething public manner. Now we cannot think that any of these will be\r\nat all offended that all this new establishment should be revoked;\r\nnay, we have heard it openly said, that the Scots are so little\r\nsatisfied with the union at this time, that if it were now to be put\r\nto the vote, as it was before, whether they should unite with England,\r\nor no, there would not be one man in fifteen, throughout Scotland,\r\nthat would vote for it. If then it appears that the whole nation thus\r\nseems to be averse to the union, and by the coming in of this most\r\nglorious pretender that union will be in all appearance dissolved, and\r\nthe nation freed from the incumbrance of it, will any Scots man, who\r\nis against the union, refuse to be for the pretender? Sure it cannot\r\nbe; I know it is alleged, that they will lay aside their discontent at\r\nthe union, and unite together against the pretender, because that is\r\nto unite against popery; we will not say what a few, who have their\r\neyes in their heads, may do; but as the generality of the people there\r\nare not so well reconciled together, as such a thing requires, it is\r\nnot unlikely that such a uniting may be prevented, if the pretender's\r\nfriends there can but play the game of dividing them farther, as they\r\nshould do; to which end it cannot but be very serviceable to them to\r\nhave the real advantages of receiving the pretender laid before them,\r\nwhich is the true intent and meaning of the present undertaking.\r\n\r\nBut we have more and greater advantages of the coming of the\r\npretender, and such as no question will invite you to receive him with\r\ngreat satisfaction and applause; and it cannot be unnecessary to\r\ninform you, for your direction in other cases, how the matter, as to\r\nreal and imaginary advantage, stands with the nation in this affair;\r\nand First, the coming of the pretender will at once put us all out of\r\ndebt. These abomination whigs, and these bloody wars, carried on so\r\nlong for little or nothing, have, as is evident to our senses now,\r\n(whatever it was all along), brought a heavy debt upon the nation; so\r\nthat if what a known author lately published is true, the government\r\npays now almost six millions a year to the common people for interest\r\nof money; that is to say, the usurers eat up the nation, and devour\r\nsix millions yearly; which is paid, and must be paid now for a long\r\ntime, if some kind turn, such as this of the coming of the pretender,\r\nor such like, does not help us out of it; the weight of this is not\r\nonly great, insuperably great, but most of it is entailed for a\r\nterrible time, not only for our age, but beyond the age of our\r\ngrandchildren, even for ninety-nine years; by how much the\r\nconsideration of this debt is intolerable and afflicting to the last\r\ndegree, by so much the greater must the obligation be to the person\r\nwho will ease the nation of such a burden, and therefore we place it\r\namong the principal advantages which we are to receive from the\r\nadmission of the pretender, that he will not fail to rid us of this\r\ngrievance, and by methods peculiar to himself deliver us from so great\r\na burden as these debts are now, and, unless he deliver us, are like\r\nto be to the ages to come; whether he will do this at once, by\r\nremitting most graciously to the nation the whole payment, and\r\nconsequently take off the burden _brevi manu_, as with a sponge wiping\r\nout the infamous score, leaving it to fall as fate directs, or by\r\nprudent degrees, we know not, nor is it our business to determine it\r\nhere; no doubt the doing it with a jerk, as we call it, _comme une\r\ncoup de grace_, must be the most expeditious way; nay, and the kindest\r\nway of putting the nation out of its pain; for lingering deaths are\r\ncounted cruel; and though _une coup d'eclat_ may make an impression\r\nfor the present, yet the astonishment is soonest over; besides, where\r\nis the loss to the nation in this sense? though the money be stopped\r\nfrom the subject on one hand, if it be stopped to the subjects on the\r\nother, the nation loses or gains nothing: we know it will be answered,\r\nthat it is unjust, and that thousands of families will be ruined,\r\nbecause they who lose, will not be those who gain. But what is this to\r\nthe purpose in a national revolution; unjust! alas! is that an\r\nargument? Go and ask the pretender! Does not he say you have all done\r\nunjustly by him? and since the nation in general loses nothing, what\r\nobligation has he to regard the particular injury that some families\r\nmay sustain? And yet farther, is it not remarkable, that most part of\r\nthe money is paid by the cursed party of whigs, who from the beginning\r\nofficiously appeared to keep him from his right? And what obligation\r\nhas he upon him to concern himself for doing them right in particular,\r\nmore than other people? But to avoid the scandal of partiality, there\r\nis another thought offers to our view, which the nation is beholding\r\nto a particular author for putting us in mind of; if it be unjust\r\nthat we should suppose the pretender shall stop the payment on both\r\nsides, because it is doing the whigs wrong, since the tories, who\r\nperhaps being chiefly landed men, pay the most taxes; then, to keep up\r\na just balance, he need only continue the taxes to be paid in, and\r\nonly stop the annuities and interest which are to be paid out. Thus\r\nboth sides having no reason to envy or reproach one another with\r\nhardships, or with suffering unequally; they may every one lose their\r\nproportion, and the money may be laid up in the hands of the new\r\nsovereign, for the good of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis being thus happily proposed, we cannot pass over the great\r\nadvantages which would accrue to this nation in such a case, by having\r\nsuch a mass of money laid up in the exchequer at the absolute command\r\nof a most gracious French sovereign. But as these things are so\r\nglorious, and so great, as to admit of no complete explication in this\r\nshort tract, give us leave, O people of Great Britain, to lay before\r\nyou a little sketch of your future felicity, under the auspicious\r\nreign of such a glorious prince, as we all hope, and believe the\r\npretender to be. 1. You are to allow, that by such a just and\r\nrighteous shutting up of the exchequer in about seven years' time, he\r\nmay be supposed to have received about forty millions sterling from\r\nhis people, which not being to be found in specie in the kingdom,\r\nwill, for the benefit of circulation, enable him to treasure up\r\ninfinite funds of wealth in foreign banks, a prodigious mass of\r\nforeign bullion, gold, jewels, and plate, to be ready in the tower, or\r\nelsewhere, to be issued upon future emergency, as occasion may allow.\r\nThis prodigious wealth will necessarily have these happy events, to\r\nthe infinite satisfaction and advantage of the whole nation, and the\r\nbenefit of which I hope none will be so unjust, or ungrateful, to\r\ndeny. 1. It will for ever after deliver this nation from the burden,\r\nthe expense, the formality, and the tyranny, of parliaments. No one\r\ncan perhaps at the first view be rightly sensible of the many\r\nadvantages of this article, and from how many mischiefs it will\r\ndeliver this nation. 1. How the country gentlemen will be no longer\r\nharassed to come, at the command of every court occasion, and upon\r\nevery summons by the prince's proclamation, from their families and\r\nother occasions, whether they can be spared from their wives, &c., or\r\nno, or whether they can trust their wives behind them, or no; nay,\r\nwhether they can spare money or no for the journey, or whether they\r\nmust come carriage paid or no; then they will no more be unnecessarily\r\nexposed to long and hazardous journeys, in the depth of winter, from\r\nthe remotest corners of the island, to come to London, just to give\r\naway the country's money, and go home again; all this will be\r\ndispensed with by the kind and gracious management of the pretender,\r\nwhen he, God bless us, shall be our more gracious sovereign. 2. In the\r\nhappy consequence of the demise of parliaments, the country will be\r\neased of that intolerable burden of travelling to elections, sometimes\r\nin the depth of winter, sometimes in the middle of their harvest,\r\nwhenever the writs of elections arbitrarily summons them. 3. And with\r\nthem the poor gentlemen will be eased of that abominable grievance of\r\nthe nation, viz., the expense of elections, by which so many gentlemen\r\nof estates have been ruined, so many innocent people, of honest\r\nprinciples before, have been debauched, and made mercenary, partial,\r\nperjured, and been blinded with bribes to sell their country and\r\nliberties to who bids most. It is well known how often, and yet how in\r\nvain, this distemper has been the constant concern of parliaments for\r\nmany ages, to cure, and to provide sufficient remedies for. Now if\r\never the effectual remedy for this is found out, to the inexpressible\r\nadvantage of the whole nation; and this perhaps is the only cure for\r\nit that the nature of the disease will admit of; what terrible havock\r\nhas this kind of trade made among the estates of the gentry, and the\r\nmorals of the common people? 4. How also has it kept alive the\r\nfactions and divisions of the country people, keeping them in a\r\nconstant agitation, and in triennial commotions? So that what with\r\nforming new interests, and cultivating old, the heats and animosities\r\nnever cease among the people. But once set the pretender upon the\r\nthrone, and let the funds be but happily stopped, and paid into his\r\nhands, that he may be in no more need of a parliament, and all these\r\ndistempers will be cured as effectually as a fever is cured by cutting\r\noff the head, or as a halter cures the bleeding at the nose. How\r\ninfatuated then is this nation, that they should so obstinately refuse\r\na prince, by the nature of whose circumstances, and the avowed\r\nprinciples of whose party, we are sure to obtain such glorious things,\r\nsuch inestimable advantages, things which no age, no prince, no\r\nattempt of parties, or endeavour, though often aimed at of ministers\r\nof state, have ever been able to procure for us. 2. This amassing of\r\ntreasure, by the stopping the funds on one hand, and the receiving the\r\ntaxes on the other, will effectually enable the pretender to set up,\r\nand effectually maintain, that glorious, and so often-desired method\r\nof government, _au coup de canon, Anglice_, a standing army. This we\r\nhave the authority of the ancient borough of Carlisle, that it is the\r\nsafety of the prince, and the glory of the nation, as appears by their\r\nrenowned address to King James II. Then we should see a new face of\r\nour nation, and Britain would no more be a naked nation, as it has\r\nformerly been; then we should have numerous and gallant armies\r\nsurrounding a martial prince; ready to make the world, as well as his\r\nown subjects, tremble; then our inland counties would appear full of\r\nroyal fortifications, citadels, forts, and strong towns; the beauty of\r\nthe kingdom, and awe of factious rebels: it is a strange thing that\r\nthis refractory people of ours could never be made sensible how much\r\nit is for the glory and safety of this nation that we should be put\r\ninto a posture of defence against ourselves: it has been often\r\nalleged, that this nation can never be ruined but with their own\r\nconsent: if then we are our own enemies, is it not highly requisite\r\nthat we should be put in a position to have our own ruin prevented?\r\nAnd that since it is apparent we are no more fit to be trusted with\r\nour own liberties, having a natural and a national propensity to\r\ndestroy and undo ourselves, and may be brought to consent to our own\r\nruin, we should have such princes, as for the future know how to\r\nrestrain us, and how reasonable is it to allow them forces to do so?\r\n\r\nWe might enlarge here upon the great and certain advantages of this\r\nbest of governments, a standing army; we might go back to the Persian,\r\nGrecian, and Roman empires, which had never arrived to such a pitch of\r\nglory if the people and nations whom they subdued had been able to\r\nnose them with such trifles as what we call constitution, national\r\nright, ancient privileges, and the like; we might descend also to\r\nparticular advantages of government, which it is hoped we may attain\r\nto in Britain when the pretender arrives, some of which are grown\r\nobsolete, and out of use, by custom, and long possession of those\r\ntroublesome things called liberties; among these may be reckoned,\r\n\r\n1. The whole kingdom will be at once eased of that ridiculous\r\nfeather-cap's expense of militia and trained-bands, which serve for\r\nlittle else but to justify the picking the peoples' pockets, with an\r\nannual tax of trophy-money, and every now and then putting the city of\r\nLondon and parts adjacent, to ten thousand pound charge, to beat\r\ndrums, and shoot muskets, for nothing; when, on the contrary, you\r\nshall in the blessed revolution we now invite you to, have all this\r\ndone gratis, by the standing troops kept constantly in pay; and your\r\nlieutenancy may lay down their commissions among the rest of\r\nnon-significants of the nation.\r\n\r\n2. You shall be for ever out of danger of being ridden again by the\r\nmob, your meeting-houses shall no more be the subject of the enraged\r\nrabbles; nor shall the bank of England desire the drums to beat at\r\nmidnight to raise a guard for Grocers' hall; your new monarch will\r\nsuffer none to insult or plunder the city but himself; and as the city\r\nitself shall never want soldiers, (how should it, when the whole\r\nkingdom shall become a garrison?) the money in the bank shall always\r\nbe defended by a strong guard, who shall, whenever there is any danger\r\nof its being too safe, convey it, for its eminent security, from\r\nGrocers'-alley to the Tower, or to the exchequer, where it shall not\r\nfail to be kept for the advantage of the public.\r\n\r\n3. Again; upon this happy change we shall immediately be delivered\r\nfrom that most infamous practice of stock-jobbing, of which so much\r\nhas been said to so little purpose; for the funds being turned all\r\ninto one general stock, and the prince being himself your security,\r\nyou may even write upon all your companies this general phrase, viz.,\r\nNo transfer, as they do when the books are shut up at the bank, or\r\nEast-India house; so as all the rivers of water are swallowed up in\r\nthe sea, as one ocean, to which they are all tending, so all these\r\npetty cheats will be engulfed at once in the general ocean of state\r\ntrick, and the Exchange-alley men may justly be said to buy the\r\nbear-skin ever after.\r\n\r\n4. When (which is a blessing we fear we cannot hope for before) we may\r\nexpect to be delivered from the throng of virulent and contumacious\r\nlibels which now infest our streets; and the libellers themselves\r\nbeing most exemplarily punished, for a terror to the rest, will not\r\ndare to affront the government with ballads and balderdash; if an\r\nimpudent fellow dares lift up his pen against the authority and power\r\nof his prince, he shall instantly feel the weight of that power to\r\ncrush him, which he ought before to have feared; and pamphleteers\r\nshall then not be whipped and pilloried, but hanged; and when two or\r\nthree of them have suffered that way, it is hoped those wholesome\r\nseverities may put an effectual stop to the noise and clamour they now\r\nmake in the nation; above all, the hands of the government will then\r\nbe set free from the fetters of law; and it shall not be always\r\nnecessary for the ministers of state to proceed by all the forms of\r\nthe courts of justice, in such cases, by which the scribblers of the\r\nage pretend to stand it out against the government, and put their own\r\nconstruction upon their libels. But when these happy days arrive,\r\njuries and judges shall find and determine in these and all other\r\ncases, bring verdicts, and give sentence, as the prince in his royal\r\njustice shall direct.\r\n\r\nWe might enter here upon a long list of other happy circumstances we\r\nshall all arrive to, and of great advantages not here named, which the\r\ncoming in of the pretender shall infallibly bring us to the enjoyment\r\nof, particularly in matters of religion, civil right, property, and\r\ncommerce; but the needful brevity of this tract will not admit of it,\r\nwe shall only add one thing more, which gives weight to all the rest,\r\nviz., that the certainty of these things, and of their being the\r\nnatural consequences of the bringing in the pretender, adds to the\r\ncertain felicity of that reign. This sums up the happiness of the\r\npretender's reign; we need not talk of security, as the Review has\r\ndone, and pretend he is not able to give us security for the\r\nperformance of anything he promises; every man that has any sense of\r\nthe principles, honour, and justice of the pretender, his zeal for the\r\nRoman catholic cause, his gratitude to his benefactor, the French\r\nking, and his love to the glory and happiness of his native country,\r\nmust rest satisfied of his punctually performing all these great\r\nthings for us; to ask him security, would be not to affront him only,\r\nbut to affront the whole nation; no man can doubt him; the nature of\r\nthe thing allows that he must do us all that kindness; he cannot be\r\ntrue to his own reason without it; wherefore this treaty executes\r\nitself, and appears so rational to believe, that whoever doubts it may\r\nbe supposed to doubt even the veracity of James the Just.\r\n\r\nWhat unaccountable folly then must those people be guilty of, who\r\nstand so much in the way of their own and their country's happiness,\r\nas to oppose, or pretend to argue against, the receiving this glorious\r\nprince, and would be for having Dutch men and foreigners forsooth to\r\ncome, and all under the notion of their being protestants? To avoid\r\nand detect which fallacy, we shall in our next essay enter into the\r\nexamination of the religion and orthodox principles of the person of\r\nthe pretender, and doubt not to make it out, for the satisfaction of\r\nall tender consciences, that he is a true protestant of the church of\r\nEngland, established by law, and that in the very natural primitive\r\nsense of that phrase as it was used by his royal predecessor, of\r\nfamous and pious memory, Charles II.----and as such, no doubt, he will\r\nendeavour for the recovery of the crown, which crown, if he obtains\r\nit, you see what glorious things he may do for himself, and us.\r\n\r\n_Quam si non tenuit magnis tamen excidit ausis._",
