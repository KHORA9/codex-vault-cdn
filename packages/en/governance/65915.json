In\r\npoint of fact there is no-one whose judgment in these matters I\r\nwould trust more readily than yours. You are a philosopher; and the\r\nphilosopher’s outlook in politics is always clear, practical and\r\nrealistic as contrasted with the thoroughly romantic illusions of\r\nthe typical party man. That, by the way, is why Mr. Balfour, the\r\nphilosopher, has in the domain of parliamentary and electoral strategy\r\nhopelessly outwitted Mr. Chamberlain, the “man of business and busy\r\nman”--to quote his own characteristically poetic phrase.\r\n\r\nAs a philosopher you are able to see what no “practical statesman” on\r\neither side of the House seems likely to perceive--that social and\r\neconomic politics are the only kind of politics that really matter,\r\nand that the “chicken-in-the-pot” ideal of Henri Quatre is after all\r\nthe primary aim of all statesmanship. Three centuries of anarchic\r\ncommercialism have left us a legacy of pauperism, disease, famine,\r\nphysical degeneracy and spiritual demoralization, which in another\r\ncentury will infallibly destroy us altogether if we cannot in the mean\r\ntime destroy them. And I think you share my impatience when our Radical\r\nfriends insist on discussing Irish Home Rule, Church Disestablishment\r\nand the abolition of the House of Lords, as if such frivolities could\r\nreally satisfy the human conscience faced with the appalling realities\r\nof the slums.\r\n\r\nWhen therefore I speak of your interest in politics I am not thinking\r\nof that rather exciting parlour game which they play at Westminster\r\nduring the spring months. In this you probably take less interest than\r\nI; for I must confess (not altogether without shame) that the sporting\r\naspect of politics has always fascinated me. You, on the other hand,\r\nhave _Bridge_ to amuse you; and, when you are brought to the bar of\r\nthe Nonconformist Conscience on this count, you may fairly plead that\r\nany man who played _Bridge_ with the peculiar mixture of ignorance,\r\nstupidity, criminal laziness and flagrant dishonesty with which the\r\nFront Benches play the game of politics, would infallibly be turned out\r\nof his club and probably cut by all his acquaintances.\r\n\r\nIt may seem surprising that, taking this view of contemporary party\r\nwarfare, I should have troubled to write a book in criticism of it.\r\nTo which I can only reply that the parliamentary bridge-players are\r\nunfortunately staking on their pastime not their own money but my\r\ncountry’s interests; so that the incidents of the game become important\r\ndespite the frivolity of the players, and it seems to me that we are\r\non the eve of a turn of luck which may prove not only important but\r\ndisastrous.\r\n\r\nI suppose that we are not unlikely to have a General Election within\r\nthe forthcoming year; and many indications appear to point to the\r\nprobability of a sweeping Liberal victory. I want you to consider\r\ncarefully what a Liberal victory means for us and for all serious\r\nreformers.\r\n\r\nA Liberal victory means one of two things; either six years\r\nof government by the Whigs or six years of government by the\r\nNonconformists. There is no third alternative, for neither the old\r\ndestructive Free-thinking Radicalism of the late Charles Bradlaugh\r\nand the almost extinct Secular Society, nor the new sentimental High\r\nChurch Radicalism of my excellent friend C. F. G. Masterman and his\r\nassociates of the _Commonwealth_ has the slightest hold on any section\r\nof the electorate that counts politically. If you doubt this, it is\r\nbecause you did not follow Masterman’s campaign at Dulwich as closely\r\nas I did. Vehement Catholic though he was, he was forced to accept\r\nall the political shibboleths of Nonconformity on pain of certain\r\nannihilation; yet, even after he had gone to the very verge of what\r\nhis conscience would permit to conciliate his sectarian masters, this\r\ndid not save him from a crushing defeat. An excellent candidate, an\r\neloquent and effective speaker with real civic enthusiasm, he met the\r\nsame fate which overtook Bernard Shaw at St. Pancras, when he stood for\r\nthe L.C.C. And that fate will continue to overtake all who rely on\r\nRadical support without first making their full submission--political,\r\ntheological and moral--to the Vatican of Dissent.\r\n\r\nThe Radical wing of the Liberal Party has degenerated into a political\r\ncommittee of the Free Church Councils; even the Liberal League cannot\r\nget on without making some acknowledgement of Nonconformist authority.\r\nBut the “Imperialist” section is of course less absolutely under the\r\ncontrol of Salem Chapel than its rival; is it fundamentally any more\r\nprogressive?\r\n\r\nIt is pathetic in the light of subsequent events to read again the\r\nadmirable article (to which by the way I am indebted for the title of\r\nthis book) contributed by Mr. Webb to the _Nineteenth Century_ three\r\nyears ago. Mr. Webb was so simple-minded as to suppose that Lord\r\nRosebery’s talk about “national efficiency” really meant something,\r\nand that “Liberal Imperialism” was a genuine attempt to form a\r\nparty of progress free of Gladstonian tradition. Sancta simplicitas!\r\nWe can see now clearly enough that the Liberal Imperialists were\r\nfor the most part mere squeezable opportunists with all the effete\r\nprejudices of the Pro-Boers minus their sturdiness of conviction,\r\nmen who wished to snatch a share in the popularity of the South\r\nAfrican War, but had not the slightest intention of abandoning a\r\nsingle Mid-Victorian nostrum, which could still be used to catch a\r\nfew votes. On the Education Bills, Tariff Reform and Licensing, they\r\nhave Gladstonised, Miallised, Cobdenised and Wilfred-Lawsonised with\r\nthe best. And now that the Fiscal Question seems likely to drive back\r\ninto the ranks of the Liberal “Right” such men as Lord Goschen and the\r\nDuke of Devonshire--the very men who were frightened to death of Mr.\r\nChamberlain’s “Socialism” as far back as 1885--all hope of reform from\r\nthat quarter is at an end. A “Liberal Imperialist” government means\r\nLord Rosebery orating nobly about nothing in particular, Lord Goschen\r\nand the Duke of Devonshire acting up to their self-constituted function\r\nof “drags upon the wheel,” and Sir Henry Fowler once more sitting\r\nheavily on all enlightened municipal enterprise in the interests of\r\npiratical monopolists. I see that the Whigs are already crying out for\r\n“Free Trade concentration,” which will I imagine prove an excellent\r\nexcuse for doing nothing for the next half decade.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, I fear, we shall have to accept the Whigs as the lesser of\r\ntwo evils. At least their offences will in the main be negative, while\r\nthe victory of the Nonconformists means a period of legislation so\r\ndisastrous that you and I and all advanced reformers will be obliged\r\nto cling to the House of Lords as our only bulwark against the\r\nappalling flood of reaction. For some time the Nonconformists have\r\nbeen clamouring for the repeal of the admirable Education Acts of\r\n1902-3. They have now begun to clamour for the repeal of the Licensing\r\nAct as well. Now, quite apart from the merits of these measures, it\r\nis as clear as daylight that all progress will be impossible if every\r\ngovernment devotes its time and energies to repealing the measures of\r\nits predecessor. This disastrous precedent will be but the first-fruit\r\nof a Dissent-driven ministry. Meanwhile our refreshments, our\r\namusements, even our religious observances will be subjected to silly\r\nsectarian taboos. Social reform will be hopelessly neglected, while we\r\nmay have to face a revival of the foolish agitation in favour of Church\r\nDisestablishment which even Mr. Chamberlain’s marvellous genius for\r\nelectioneering could not persuade the country to take very seriously in\r\nthe eighties.\r\n\r\n“The Whigs are a class with all the selfish prejudices and all the\r\nvices of a class; the Radicals are a sect with all the grinding tyranny\r\nand all the debasing fanaticism of a sect.” Those words are as true\r\nto-day as they were when Lord Randolph Churchill spoke them nearly\r\ntwenty years ago. Indeed all that has happened since has tended to\r\nmake the Whigs more selfishly “class-conscious” and the Radicals more\r\ndebasingly sectarian.\r\n\r\nIt may be retorted that the Tories are no better equipped for the\r\nart of statesmanship. I assent; but I say that on the whole they are\r\nless positively dangerous. For one thing the very cloudiness of their\r\npolitical outlook renders them to a great extent amenable to skilful\r\nand systematic pressure from genuine reformers. It is often possible\r\nto get them to pass good measures without knowing it, as Mr. Webb and\r\nMr. Morant are supposed to have induced them to pass an Education\r\nBill which would have been rejected with unanimity by the Cabinet,\r\nthe Conservative Party, the House of Lords and all three Houses of\r\nConvocation, had its real excellence been perceived by those bodies.\r\nAlso the Tories have not always in their pockets that dilapidated\r\nbundle of red herrings (the Church, the Lords, etc), which the Radicals\r\nproduce periodically whenever the electorate has to be deluded. But,\r\nwhen all has been said, it must be confessed that there is little to\r\nbe hoped from the Tories just now. They had their chance in 1895, when\r\nthey came into power on the cry of “Social Reform.” Had they fulfilled\r\ntheir pledges then, we should never have had to face the terror of\r\na Gladstonian resurrection. But they failed; and the great Tory\r\nrevival which Randolph Churchill inaugurated has ended in a pageant of\r\nfashionable incompetence above, and frivolous Jingoism (inexpressibly\r\ndisquieting to serious Imperialists) below, the wires being pulled\r\nvigorously meanwhile by the unclean hands of Hebrew Finance--a sight\r\nthat would have made Churchill sick at heart.\r\n\r\nThere remains the Labour Party which I discuss fully elsewhere. Here\r\nI will only say that, while I believe that the only hope for England\r\nand the Empire is in Socialism, I confess that, if I am to trust to\r\nSocialists as I see them at present (outside our own Fabian Society) I\r\nfeel the hope to be a slender one.\r\n\r\nTo conclude: if you and I vote (as I expect we shall) for Tory\r\ncandidates at the next election, it will not be from any admiration\r\nfor the present government, rather it will be from a very natural fear\r\nlest a worse thing befall us. I have written this book for the same\r\nreason; it may be taken among other things as a word of advise to my\r\nfellow-citizens to weigh carefully, before recording their verdict on\r\ntheir present rulers, the respective merits of the frying pan and the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nThe warning, I think you at least will agree with me, is by no means\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\n  Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\n        CECIL CHESTERTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIBERALISM AND THE ZEITGEIST.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the custom of Macaulay and other representative writers of the\r\nDark Ages to speak of the mediæval era in Europe as one of savage and\r\nunenlightened barbarism. There is something particularly amusing to the\r\ntwentieth century observer in the patronizing tone adopted by men, who\r\nlived in what could hardly be called a community at all, in writing of\r\nthe splendid civilization which flourished under Frederick II. and St.\r\nLouis. For it is becoming obvious to us all now that the great movement\r\nof the world from the fifteenth to the nineteenth century was not a\r\nmovement towards civilization but a movement away from it. Civilization\r\ndoes not imply a collection of mechanical contrivances brought to a\r\nhigh state of perfection--it may or may not possess such contrivances.\r\nBut it does imply a _Civitas_, a commonwealth, a conscious organization\r\nof society for certain ends. This the age of St. Louis had, and the\r\nage of Cobden had not. The great movement which we roughly call\r\n“Liberalism” may therefore be very properly described as a reaction\r\nagainst civilization.\r\n\r\nI do not say it was wrong. Let none suppose that I have any share in\r\nthe factitious dreams of the “Young England” enthusiasts or their\r\ncontemporary imitators. I know that Feudalism died in the fifteenth\r\ncentury of its own rottenness, and that its revival is as hopeless and\r\nundesirable as the revival of Druidism (much favoured I believe in\r\nsome literary quarters just now) would be. I recognise that Liberalism\r\nin getting rid of its obsolete relics did good and necessary work\r\nand cleared the way for better. I merely state the case historically\r\nbecause it is impossible to understand the present position and\r\nprospects of Liberalism without realizing that Liberalism is in its\r\nessence destructive and in the strict sense of the word anti-social.\r\n\r\nLook at the track of Liberalism across English history. It begins\r\npractically with the Reformation and the Great Pillage, wherein it\r\nshowed its true character very vividly in the combination of a strictly\r\nindividualistic religion with the conversion of communal property into\r\nprivate property for the benefit of the new “Reforming” oligarchs.\r\nThen it appears in the Civil War, which we are beginning to understand\r\nbetter than the Whig historians of the late century understood it. On\r\nits economic side Puritanism was the seventeenth century counterpart\r\nof Cobdenism--a middle-class movement striking at once at the old\r\naristocracy, whose lands it confiscated and divided, and at the\r\nproletariat, whom it robbed of what was left of their common heritage\r\nand to whom it denied their traditional holidays, avowedly on religious\r\ngrounds but practically in the interests of the employing class. One\r\ncould continue the story further if it were necessary. But all that\r\nneed be said is that in the middle of the nineteenth century we find\r\nLiberalism everywhere dominant and victorious with the result that\r\nEnglishmen had practically ceased to form a community at all.\r\n\r\nIt is a common taunt in the mouths of Tariff Reformers just now that\r\nCobden and Bright opposed the Factory Acts; and Liberals, driven\r\ninto a corner on the subject, generally affect to regard this as an\r\nunfortunate and unaccountable lapse from grace on the part of the two\r\nFree Trade Apostles. Of course it was nothing of the sort: it was\r\nthe only possible line for them to take as honest men and consistent\r\npolitical thinkers. The matter of the Factory Acts does not stand\r\nalone: state education, when first proposed was met with Radical\r\nopposition of a very similar kind. If anyone will look through the\r\nspeeches of the opponents of the early Factory Bills he will find that\r\nthey were attacked, just as the present government’s Education Bill\r\nwas attacked, not as revolutionary but as reactionary measures. They\r\nwere constantly compared to the Sumptuary Laws and to the statutes\r\nregulating the position of apprentices which figure in mediæval\r\nlegislation. And the comparison is a perfectly fair one. Cobden and\r\nBright were fundamentally _right_ in their contention that Factory\r\nActs were contrary to the first principles of Liberalism. Such acts\r\nwere only passed, because the application of Liberal principles to\r\nthe questions involved had resulted in a welter of brutality, child\r\ntorture and racial deterioration, so horrible that no decently humane\r\nman, no reasonable enlightened citizen could think of Lancashire and\r\nits cotton trade without a shudder. When the Sovereign gave her assent\r\nto the first effective Factory Bill she passed a prophetic sentence of\r\ndeath on Liberalism and the Liberal Party.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the execution of the sentence has been long deferred and\r\nmay yet be deferred longer. But the backbone had been taken out of\r\nLiberalism as soon as that concession had been made. It could not claim\r\nany longer to have a coherent or intelligible political philosophy.\r\nFor the arguments used by the Manchester School against import duties\r\nwere precisely the same as those used against factory legislation.\r\nThe two propositions were based upon the same axioms and postulates;\r\nif one was wrong, why not the other? And if the worship of “doing as\r\none likes” were unsound in the region of economics what reason was\r\nthere for supposing it to be sound in the region of politics? If Free\r\nContract were an untenable foundation for society, what became of Free\r\nTrade? And, if Free Trade were to go, might not the demand for a Free\r\nChurch have to follow? The fortress of Liberalism still looked imposing\r\nenough, but the foundations were sapped and there were ominous cracks\r\nand fissures in the walls.\r\n\r\nIndeed the passing of the great Factory Acts marks the turning of\r\nthe tide. It was the public confession of the English nation that\r\nCobden’s and Bastiat’s Utopia of ‘economic harmonies’ was a foolish and\r\nimpossible one, based on bad economics and worse history. It was the\r\nbeginning of the reaction in favour of what I have called civilization,\r\nthat is of the conscious and deliberate regulation and control of\r\ncommerce in the public interest. Everything that has been done since\r\nin the way of industrial reform--Housing Acts, Public Health Acts,\r\ncompulsory and free education, municipal ownership and municipal\r\ntrading--has proceeded in this direction. We are working towards what\r\nHerbert Spencer called “The New Toryism,” that is back to civilization.\r\n\r\nIt is no matter for surprise that most of the measures mentioned above\r\nhave been the work of Tory governments. Doubtless the Tories are stupid\r\nand ineffectual enough, doubtless they are too much controlled by\r\nlanded interests and capitalist rings, to deal with social evils very\r\ncourageously. But at least they have this great advantage over their\r\nenemies, that they are not obliged to reconcile everything they do\r\nwith the exploded economic dogmas of Benthamism, so that the insight\r\nand progressive instincts of their abler leaders have been able to\r\nforce them farther along the path of progress than the sheer pressure\r\nof political necessity has been able to force the equally reluctant\r\nLiberals. So long as social reform remains a matter of pickings, we\r\nshall get the best pickings from the Tories.\r\n\r\nBut if, as I have suggested all meaning has long ago gone out of\r\nLiberalism, how does it come about that Liberalism insists on\r\nsurviving? Are we not all expecting a big Liberal majority at the next\r\nGeneral Election, and would not such a majority prove that Liberalism\r\nwas very much alive? My answer is that it would not. Doubtless the\r\nLiberals will win at the polls next year; probably they will get a good\r\nmajority. But this will prove nothing as to the spiritual vitality of\r\nthe thing they represent. It will prove that the people of this country\r\nare annoyed with the present government and want a change. It will not\r\nprove that they are in any real sense of the word Liberals; still less\r\nthat Liberalism has anything vital or valuable to say in relation to\r\ncurrent problems.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that a party which has parted with its convictions may\r\ncontinue to exist for a long time by living on its prejudices. This\r\nis the ordinary history of movements, whether political, social or\r\nreligious, during the period of their decadence, and it is briefly the\r\nhistory of Liberalism during the last fifty years.\r\n\r\nThe Factory Acts, by their obvious necessity and their equally obvious\r\nindefensibility from the Liberal standpoint, knocked the bottom out\r\nof Liberalism and made a consistent Liberal philosophy impossible for\r\nthe future. But only new and growing movements require a philosophy.\r\nWhen a movement has been going long enough to accumulate a fair number\r\nof catch-words and a collection of common likes and dislikes, it can\r\nmake enormous use of these and even win great electoral triumphs on the\r\nstrength of them long after they have become completely separated from\r\nthe doctrines from which they originally sprang, and indeed long after\r\nthese doctrines have become so obsolete as to be universally incredible.\r\n\r\nAn almost exact parallel may be drawn between the recent history\r\nof Liberalism and the recent history of Nonconformity. English\r\nNonconformity was founded on the doctrines of Calvin as English\r\nLiberalism was on those of Lock and Adam Smith. Where are the doctrines\r\nof Calvin now? I do not suppose there is one chapel in London--perhaps\r\nin England--where the doctrine of Reprobation is taught in all its\r\ninfamous completeness. The ordinary London Nonconformist minister\r\nat any rate is the mildest and vaguest of theologians, and talks\r\nlike the member of an Ethical Society about little but “Truth and\r\nRighteousness.” So far from preaching Calvinism with its iron and\r\ninflexible logic and its uncompromising cry of “Come out and be ye\r\nseparate!” he is the first to tell you that the age of dogma is gone by\r\nand that modern religion must be “undenominational.” Yet, in spite of\r\nthe complete disappearance of its intellectual basis, Dissent remains\r\npowerful enough to thwart the execution of great reforms and wreck\r\nthe careers of great statesmen. And if you ask what (if not a common\r\ntheology) holds the Nonconformists together and makes them so potent\r\na force, the answer will be a common stock of prejudices--a prejudice\r\nagainst Catholic ritual, a prejudice against horse-racing, a prejudice\r\nagainst established churches, a prejudice against public houses and\r\nmusic halls, a prejudice in favour of Sunday observance. All these\r\n(except in the case of church establishment where the prejudice is the\r\nresult of a political accident erected into a religious dogma) are\r\nnatural consequences of the Calvinist theology, but in that theology\r\nthe modern Dissenter does not believe. Nevertheless, the foundation\r\ngone, the prejudice remains, and may be found strong enough among\r\nother things to destroy the value of one of the most beneficent reforms\r\nwhich the last thirty years have seen.\r\n\r\nNow what has happened in the case of Nonconformity has happened also\r\nin the case of Liberalism. The philosophy of Bastiat has followed\r\nthe philosophy of Calvin into the shades of incredibility. Yet the\r\nprejudices born of that philosophy remain and can still be played\r\nupon with considerable effect. They may briefly be summarized as\r\nfollows:--A prejudice against peers (though not against capitalists), a\r\nprejudice against religious establishments, a prejudice against state\r\ninterference with _foreign_ trade (the case of home industry having\r\nbeen conceded), a prejudice against Imperialism, a prejudice against\r\nwhat is vaguely called “militarism”--that is to say against provision\r\nfor national defence. Add prejudices borrowed from the Nonconformists\r\nagainst publicans and priests and you have the sum total of modern\r\nLiberalism.\r\n\r\nNow I regard all these prejudices as mere hindrances to progress. I\r\nwish to show in the pages which are to follow that they are not, as\r\nthe enthusiastic Radical imagines, the very latest manifestations of\r\n“progressive thought,” but that on the contrary they are the refuse\r\nof a dead epoch and an exploded theory of politics, that considered\r\nas a message for our age they are barren and impossible, that a party\r\ndominated by them is unfitted for public trust, and that, unless newer\r\nand more promising movements can emancipate themselves from their\r\ninfluence, they are likely to share the same ultimate fate.\r\n\r\nPeel is said to have caught the Whigs bathing and stolen their clothes.\r\nBut the present apparel of the Liberals is not such as to tempt any\r\nself-respecting party to theft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“WHAT PORTION HAVE WE IN DAVID?”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ordinary man conceives of a Socialist as a kind of very extreme\r\nLiberal or Radical, a man who pushes Radical doctrines further than\r\nmost Radicals dare push them. Indeed many Socialists conceive so of\r\nthemselves. Yet it is obvious that, if there is any truth at all\r\nin what I have just written, this must be regarded as a complete\r\nmisconception.\r\n\r\nSocialism and Collectivism are names which we give to the extreme\r\ndevelopment of that tendency in political thought which has proved so\r\nfatal to Liberalism, which is indeed a reaction against Liberalism.\r\nKarl Marx himself, revolutionary though he was, admitted that the\r\nEnglish Factory Acts were the first political expression of Socialism;\r\nwe have already seen that they were the death warrant of consistent\r\nand philosophic Liberalism. Every piece of Socialistic legislation is\r\nin its nature anti-Liberal. There is no getting away from the truth of\r\nHerbert Spencer’s taunt when he called Socialism “The New Toryism.”\r\nEpigrammatically expressed, that is an excellent and most complimentary\r\ndescription of it. Socialism is an attempt to adapt the old Tory\r\nconceptions of national unity, solidarity and order to new conditions.\r\nOur case against Toryism is that its economic and political synthesis\r\nis no longer possible for us. But we can have no kind of sympathy with\r\nLiberalism which is the negation of all synthesis, the proclamation of\r\nuniversal disruption.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore particularly disheartening to find that “Liberal\r\nprinciples” are apparently as sacrosanct in the eyes of many Socialists\r\nas in those of the Liberals themselves. That Socialists also denounce\r\nthe idea of a State Church, that Socialists also rail at Imperialism\r\nand condemn “bloated armaments,” that Socialists also proclaim the\r\nuniversal holiness and perfection of Free Trade--this is the really\r\nextraordinary and disturbing fact.\r\n\r\nThis, though none seems to see it, is the real root of the difficulties\r\nwhich beset every attempt to form an independent Socialist or Labour\r\nParty. You cannot have an independent party with any real backbone in\r\nit without independent thinking. And, omitting pious platitudes about\r\n“the socialization of all the means of production, distribution and\r\nexchange” there does not seem to me any perceptible difference between\r\nthe way in which the Independent Labour Party (for example) thinks\r\nabout current problems and the way in which the Liberals think about\r\nthem. They may think differently about economic abstractions, but\r\nthey do not think differently when it comes to practical politics.\r\nConsequently whenever a question divides the Liberals and the Tories,\r\nthe I.L.P. always dashes into the Liberal camp at the firing of the\r\nfirst shot without apparently waiting to consider for one moment\r\nwhether perhaps Socialism may not have an answer of its own to give\r\nwhich will in the nature of things be neither the Liberal nor the\r\nTory answer. And then the I.L.P. and their allies of the Labour\r\nRepresentation Committee boast proudly of their “independence” because\r\nthey are not allowed to speak on Liberal platforms. Of what avail is\r\nthat prohibition if the platform on which they themselves stand is in\r\nits essence a Liberal platform.\r\n\r\nA little while ago the leaders of the I.L.P. were extremely indignant\r\nbecause three L.R.C. representatives were said to have spoken at a\r\nby-election in support of Liberal candidates. The defence was that\r\nthe three leaders in question spoke, not in support of the Liberal\r\ncandidate, but in opposition to the Licensing Bill and other measures\r\nof the Conservative Government. Now it seems to me that this puts the\r\nwhole question of Socialist and Labour independence in a nutshell. If\r\nSocialists and other champions of labour have really nothing to say\r\non the Licensing Bill, Education, Tariff Reform, Chinese Labour and\r\nother topics of the hour other than what all the Liberals are saying it\r\nseems very difficult to understand why it is so very wicked of them to\r\nsupport Liberal candidates. If on every question which is really before\r\nthe country they agree with the said Liberal candidates it would seem\r\nthe obvious thing to do. At any rate I feel quite certain that they\r\nwill go on doing it, directly or indirectly, in spite of all the waste\r\npaper pledges and resolutions in the world, until they get a political\r\nphilosophy of their own, when they will realize that the Socialist (or\r\nif you prefer it the “Labour”) view of the licensing question, the\r\nfiscal question and the South African labour question is and must be\r\nfundamentally different from the Liberal and Radical view.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed for want of such realisation the rush of the Labour men\r\ninto the Liberal camp becomes more headlong every day. It began with\r\nRadical Trade Unionists newly converted to the idea of independent\r\nlabour representation. But the Socialist wing has not shown itself a\r\nwhit steadier in its allegiance to the doctrine of real independence.\r\nIf you doubt this charge, turn to an article contributed by Mr. J.\r\nRamsay MacDonald to the _Speaker_ on the subject of the International\r\nSocialist Congress at Amsterdam. The _Speaker_ if one of the ablest\r\nis one of the most thoroughly obscurantist of Liberal papers, holding\r\nfast and without shame by the traditions of Cobden and Gladstone. Mr.\r\nMacDonald has been in the past one of the most uncompromising of the\r\nleaders of the I.L.P. and is at this moment Secretary of the Labour\r\nRepresentation Committee. He seems to claim, in the passage I am going\r\nto quote, to speak for his party, and, as far as I am aware, none of\r\nthe leaders of that party have ventured to repudiate him.\r\n\r\nThis is what he says:--\r\n\r\n“If, for instance, in the next Liberal Cabinet the Rosebery faction\r\nwere strongly represented, and if no satisfactory pledges were given\r\nupon the Government’s intentions regarding Trade Union legislation,\r\nthe Labour Party would be perfectly justified in supporting a vote of\r\ncensure--or what would amount to that--on the first King’s Speech; but\r\non the other hand, if the Cabinet were anti-Imperialist, and were sound\r\non Trade Union legislation, the Labour Party would be justified in\r\ngiving it general support and in protecting it from defeat.”\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to point out that here Mr. MacDonald gives the\r\nwhole I.L.P. case hopelessly away. None reading the above passage\r\ncould suppose for a moment that it was written by a Socialist.\r\nObserve that the writer does not ask for a single item of socialist\r\nor semi-socialist legislation. He is silent about Old Age Pensions,\r\nabout an Eight Hours Day or a Minimum Wage, about a Graduated Income\r\nTax, about Housing or Factory legislation--in a word about everything\r\nthat could by any possibility be called Socialistic. For what does he\r\nask? Firstly for anti-Imperialism? Now is anti-Imperialism the same as\r\nSocialism? Is there any reason for supposing that the anti-Imperialist\r\nwing of the Liberal party will do more for labour than the Imperialist\r\nwing? Is Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman a Socialist or a Labourite? Is\r\nMr. John Morley, who for years has absolutely blocked the way in\r\nregard to social reform, a Socialist or a Labourite? Why should the\r\nLabour Party support the hopelessly outmoded rump of Little-England\r\nRadicalism without at any rate making a very stringent bargain with\r\nthem? As to trade union legislation, every Socialist would doubtless\r\nsupport it, but it is not in itself a Socialist measure; it is merely\r\nwhat everyone supposed that the Unions had obtained thirty years ago\r\nwith the assent of Liberals and Tories alike. It therefore comes to\r\nthis--that Mr. MacDonald has declared himself as regards practical\r\nissues not a Socialist at all, but an anti-Imperialist Radical who is\r\nin favour of improving the legal position of trades unions. Then why,\r\nin the name of heaven form an independent party at all? He and those\r\nwho follow him are clearly in their right place as an insignificant\r\nsection of the Radical “tail.” And that is how both Tories and Radicals\r\nwill in future regard them.\r\n\r\nBut there is one Socialist sect in England from which we might at\r\nleast expect freedom from Liberal tradition. The Social Democratic\r\nFederation is never tired of boasting of its independence, its\r\n“class-consciousness,” its stern Marxian inflexibility of purpose.\r\nYet, when it comes to practice, it is only a trifle less enslaved by\r\nLiberal ideas than the I.L.P. itself. During the South African War the\r\nS.D.F. went one better than the Liberals in its narrow pro-Boerism.\r\nIts members rallied to the support of the late Mr. Kruger (surely the\r\nstrangest leader that Social Democracy ever boasted!) and backed up the\r\nRadical Krugerites without apparently asking any questions as to their\r\npolicy on labour matters. Later, on the education question, they again\r\nrallied to the Radical standard (the standard of 1870!) and, like so\r\nmany Liberal Nonconformists, broke into ecstatic worship of the “ad\r\nhoc” principle, denouncing as “undemocratic” the socialistic policy\r\nof municipalized education which the Tory government had borrowed from\r\nthe Fabian Society. Moreover, glancing at the S.D.F. programme I find\r\namong the “palliatives” disestablishment of the church and abolition\r\nof hereditary monarchy. How the economic condition of the people is\r\ngoing to be “palliated” by these measures I do not profess to know; I\r\nwill only remark that the “palliation” does not seem very visible in\r\nthe United States at the present time. But what I want to insist upon\r\nis the utter futility of playing thus into the hands of the champions\r\nof capitalism by helping to impress workmen with the idea that their\r\nmisfortunes are wholly or in part due to those purely constitutional\r\ncauses concerning which Radicals and Conservatives are at war, while\r\nall the time we at least know that they are due to the economic\r\nstructure of society which Radicals and Conservatives alike support.\r\n\r\nI agree with the S.D.F. in thinking that a Labour party must have\r\nsome sort of doctrinal basis. An old party can live for a long while\r\non catchwords and prejudices, but you cannot build a new party up\r\nwithout some definite political ideas. But these doctrines and ideas\r\nmust not be a mere re-hash of exploded Liberal doctrines and ideas\r\nplus a theoretic belief in “the socialization of all the means,\r\netc.” The new party need not call itself Socialist,--perhaps had\r\nbetter not do so,--but its attitude towards practical matters must\r\nbe effectively socialistic. It must stand for the rights of the\r\ncommunity as emphatically as the older Liberalism stood for the\r\nrights of the individual. It must work for the state control and\r\nregulation of industry as Liberalism worked for its liberation from\r\nstate interference. In a word, it must be Protectionist in a more\r\nfar-reaching sense than that in which the word is applicable to Mr.\r\nChamberlain or Mr. Chaplin. So that its political philosophy will be\r\nemphatically anti-Liberal and may sometimes (though but accidentally)\r\nhave to be pro-Tory.\r\n\r\nMoreover, even if a Labour party could be a Labour party and nothing\r\nmore, there would always be a tactical as well as a philosophic\r\nreason for clearing our movement of all complicity with the ideas\r\nof Liberalism. During the first half of the nineteenth century it\r\nwas always supposed that the working classes of this country were\r\ngenerally, if not exclusively Radical. Possibly at that time they were,\r\nbut since their enfranchisement in 1867 they have proved themselves\r\noverwhelmingly and unrepentantly Tory. The history of the decades\r\nwhich have intervened since then has been the history of the gradual\r\ncapture by the Tories of all the great industrial districts where the\r\nworking-class vote is most powerful. Politicians of the ’forties spoke\r\nof the “Conservative Working Man” as incredulously as men would speak\r\nof a white negro. Yet events have proved not only that such a person\r\nexists, but that he can by his vote control the politics of nearly\r\nevery great manufacturing town in England.\r\n\r\nNow the Conservative working man has no fundamental objection to\r\nSocialism. The word no doubt displeases him, partly because of its\r\nforeign origin, partly from its vaguely revolutionary associations,\r\nbut on the practical application of Socialism he looks with very\r\ndecided favour. In fact it is not improbable that the conversion of\r\nthe labouring classes to Toryism was in part at least due to the fact\r\nthat during the sixties and seventies the Tories had for a leader Mr.\r\nDisraeli, whose quick Hebraic imagination and insight made him perceive\r\nthe significance of the social problem, while the Liberals were led\r\nby Mr. Gladstone, who regarded all social reform from the first with\r\nsupreme indifference which in his later days deepened into a hostility\r\nso intense and deep-rooted that he was ready to shatter his party\r\nand his own career over Home Rule, if by so doing he could stave off\r\neconomic questions. But to return to the Tory workman. I have said he\r\nhas no objection to applied Socialism. It would be a comparatively easy\r\nmatter to secure his support for a programme of advanced industrial\r\nreform, were he not required to swallow first a number of Liberal\r\ndoctrines which have no relation to his class interests and to which\r\nhe really has a strong objection--anti-Imperialism, the reduction of\r\narmaments, doctrinaire republicanism and Irish Home Rule. Once cut the\r\nLabour party free from these things and the increase of its electoral\r\npower will be enormous.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to a more detailed examination of the Liberal\r\nattitude towards current problems and its relation to the genuinely\r\nprogressive attitude, let me sum up the conclusions already reached.\r\n\r\nThere is no philosophic ground for identifying Socialism with extreme\r\nLiberalism or Radicalism. The philosophies of Liberalism and Socialism\r\nare not merely different but directly antagonistic.\r\n\r\nThere is no historical ground for regarding the Liberal party as the\r\nfriend of the working classes. The Liberal party is historically an\r\nessentially capitalist party; as a matter of fact the Tory party has\r\ncarried more drastic and valuable social reforms than its rival.\r\n\r\nThere is no tactical advantage to be gained by committing the new-born\r\nLabour party to the specific doctrines of Liberalism. The working\r\nclasses of this country have no enthusiasm for any of these doctrines\r\nand have a marked dislike for some of them.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Labour party or Socialist party or whatever the new\r\nmovement cares to call itself must if it is to succeed fling all its\r\nLiberal lumber overboard and start afresh. It is not enough that it\r\nshould be independent of Liberal money and Liberal organisation. All\r\nthis matters little. What is essential is that it should be independent\r\nof Liberal ideas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL PENRHYNISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I have already suggested the subservience of Socialists and\r\nLabourites to the traditions of Liberalism, so far from showing any\r\nsigns of abating gets worse every day. It has been getting markedly\r\nworse since the beginning of the new century. It was the South African\r\nWar more than anything else which captured the English Socialists and\r\nswept them into the most reactionary wing of the broken forces of\r\nLiberalism. Since then the Radicals have always been able by raising\r\nthe cry of “No Imperialism!” to bend the Socialists to their will.\r\nHence Mr. MacDonald’s amazing indiscretion quoted in my last chapter.\r\n\r\nI think it was Mr. Ben Tillet who alluded to the owner of the Bethesda\r\nSlate Quarries as “Kruger-Penrhyn.” I am not sure that Mr. Tillet or\r\nindeed anyone else realised the full accuracy of this description. For\r\nnot only was there a very striking resemblance between the virtues\r\nand faults of Mr. Kruger and those of Lord Penrhyn but there was an\r\neven more remarkable analogy between the claims which the two men put\r\nforward and the arguments by which those claims were attacked and\r\nupheld.\r\n\r\nThe friends of the Welsh quarrymen said in effect to Lord\r\nPenrhyn:--“You are conducting your business improperly; your narrow\r\nobstinacy is dangerous to the community and an obstacle to progress;\r\nyour conduct towards your employees is unfair and oppressive. We demand\r\nthat you either mend your ways or go.” Similarly the British government\r\nsaid in effect to Mr. Kruger “You are conducting the government of your\r\ncountry badly; your narrow obstinacy is an obstacle to progress and is\r\ncreating a situation dangerous to the peace of the world; your conduct\r\ntowards your subjects is unfair and oppressive. We demand that you\r\neither mend your ways or go.”\r\n\r\nAnd the answer is in each case the same “Shall I not do what I will\r\nwith my own?” “Are not the quarries _mine_?” asks Lord Penrhyn: “Is not\r\nthe Transvaal _ours_?” demanded Mr. Kruger. “If my workmen do not like\r\nmy management they can leave,” said Lord Penrhyn; “If the Outlanders do\r\nnot like my government they need not come,” said Mr. Kruger.\r\n\r\nNow, granting the premises of these two eminent men their conclusions\r\ncertainly follow. Indeed the popular case against both was clearly\r\nuntenable. From the Liberal point of view Lord Penrhyn was as right\r\nas Mr. Kruger; from the Conservative point of view Mr. Kruger was\r\nas right as Lord Penrhyn. It is only by assailing the fundamental\r\nassumptions of both that we can make out any fair case against either.\r\nThe only possible answer to the positions stated above is the Socialist\r\nanswer:--“No; the quarries do not really belong to Lord Penrhyn; the\r\nTransvaal does not really belong to Mr. Kruger or to the Boers. Their\r\ntitle depends on the use they make of them. Private property, whether\r\nof individuals or of nations is subject ultimately to the claims of\r\npublic necessity.”\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on this point at some length because, as I have already\r\nsaid, it was unquestionably the South African War which more than\r\nanything else rivetted on our Socialist and Labour parties the chains\r\nof Liberalism. It is perfectly natural that Liberals should champion\r\nthe “rights of nationalities,” since they are the chosen champions of\r\nthe rights of property. But what have Socialists to do with either\r\nexcept to challenge them whenever they conflict with the general\r\nwell-being? How can Socialists accept the claim of a handful of\r\nsettlers to set up a ring-fence round a certain portion of the earth’s\r\nsurface and declare it _their_ property any more than the claim of a\r\nlandlord to enclose commons?\r\n\r\nNote that I am not by any means saying that no Socialist could\r\nconsistently oppose the South African War. There are many plausible\r\ngrounds upon which he could oppose it. He could oppose it for example\r\non the ground that the two Republics would in course of time have been\r\npeaceably absorbed into the Empire, and that the attempt to hurry the\r\nprocess by war was in every way a disastrous blunder. Or again he could\r\ntake the ground that the war dangerously strengthened the already too\r\npowerful financial interests of the Rand and paved the way for such\r\nreactionary measures as the introduction of Chinese labour. I will not\r\ndiscuss here whether such arguments are sound or unsound. I only say\r\nthat the particular ground of debate chosen, the inalienable “right” of\r\na people to do what it likes with its own, is one that no Socialist can\r\ntake without self-stultification.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the leaders of the English Labour movement with a\r\nfew exceptions flung themselves recklessly into the most unintelligent\r\nsort of pro-Krugerism is one example and one very disastrous in its\r\nconsequences of the extent to which they have allowed themselves to be\r\nsaturated with the Liberal theory of wholly irresponsible Nationalism.\r\nBut it is by no means the only one. The parallel case of Ireland is in\r\nmany ways even more curious.\r\n\r\nIn considering the eternal Irish question from a Socialist standpoint\r\nthere are four dominant facts to be kept always in mind. The first\r\nis that Nationalism in the Irish sense is not a Socialist ideal in\r\nany sense, but is merely a kind of very narrow parochial Jingoism.\r\nThe second that the Irish Nationalist party is preeminently a _Parti\r\nbourgeois_ drawing its main strength from the middle orders--small\r\ntradesmen, tenant farmers and publicans, and that its political and\r\neconomic ideas are those generally characteristic of that class--rigid\r\nindividualism, peasant proprietorship and the like. The third that it\r\nis a clericalist Party, representing not the enlightened Catholicism of\r\nthe Continent but the narrowest kind of political Ultramontanism.[1]\r\nThe fourth that Mr. Gladstone’s adoption of the Home Rule cause was a\r\ndeliberate move on his part intended to stave off economic reforms in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\nNow in these circumstances it would seem almost incredible that\r\nSocialists should feel any kind of sympathy with Irish Nationalism. Yet\r\napparently they do feel such sympathy. Mr. Gladstone indeed builded\r\nbetter than he knew. He doubtless believed that by espousing Home\r\nRule he could “dish” Mr. Chamberlain and draw the attention of young\r\nLiberals and Radicals away from social questions in which they were\r\nbeginning to take a languid interest; but he could hardly have expected\r\nto effect this in the case of the Socialists and Labour leaders\r\nthemselves. Yet to a great extent his policy has achieved this, and we\r\nactually find Socialists clamouring for the retention of Home Rule in\r\nthe Liberal programme, though they must know perfectly well that its\r\nretention means the indefinite postponement of industrial matters.\r\n\r\nThere is no kind of excuse for the Nationalist partialities of\r\nSocialists because they know or ought to know that the theory that\r\nEngland oppresses Ireland is a radically false and untenable one.\r\nThat Ireland is oppressed one need not deny; but it is not England\r\nthat oppresses her. It is capitalism and landlordism that oppress\r\nIreland as they oppress England. If the S.D.F. means anything at all\r\nby its “recognition of the Class War” it ought to recognise this. And\r\nrecognising it, it ought to set its face like flint against a policy of\r\ndisunion and racial antagonism and teach the proletarians of Ireland\r\nand England to “unite” (that is to be Unionists) according to the old\r\nSocialist formula instead of encouraging the proletarians of Ireland to\r\nregard those of England as aliens and tyrants.\r\n\r\nTo say the truth I am a little tired of the wrongs of Ireland. I am\r\nquite willing to admit that she is an “oppressed nationality” with the\r\nproviso that this phrase is equally applicable to England, France,\r\nGermany, Italy and the United States. But one is tempted to point out\r\nthat concessions have been made to the Irish peasantry such as no one\r\ndreams of making to the workers of Great Britain. How much “fixity of\r\ntenure” has the English labourer in the wretched hole which his masters\r\nprovide for him? Do we sign away millions of British money and British\r\ncredit to save _him_ from the oppression of his landlord? Not at all.\r\nBut then he does not shoot from behind hedges; nor has he as yet had\r\neven the wisdom to organize a strong and independent political party\r\nwhose support is to be obtained for value received.\r\n\r\nIn a word I contend that the association of English Socialism and\r\nLabourism with the aspirations of Irish Chauvinists is theoretically\r\nmeaningless and practically suicidal. It is our business to meet the\r\nold Gladstonian cry that everything else must wait because “Ireland\r\nblocks the way” with a counter-cry, “It is Ireland’s turn to wait;\r\nLabour blocks the way.”\r\n\r\nAll this does not of course mean that no kind of devolution is\r\npracticable or desirable. There is a sense in which I am myself a\r\nconvinced “Home Ruler.” I believe that a number of causes (quite\r\nindependent of Irish Jingoism) are combining to make a vast extension\r\nof our system of local government imperative. Mr. H. G. Wells has shown\r\nthat the administrative areas of our local authorities are at present\r\nmuch too small, and the authorities themselves are quickly finding this\r\nout from practical experience. Parliament is overwhelmed with business\r\nwhich intelligent local bodies could transact much better. Imperial\r\nFederation, when it comes, will of necessity entail a large measure of\r\nlocal autonomy. Altogether some scheme of provincial councils seems\r\nless fantastic to-day than it did when Mr. Chamberlain outlined it\r\nin the ’eighties. But there is no earthly reason for conceding to the\r\nleast trustworthy and most militantly provincial part of the United\r\nKingdom anything more than you give to the rest. Ireland should get\r\nsuch autonomy as we might give to the north of England and no more.\r\nIreland is no more a Nation than Yorkshire, but there is every reason\r\nwhy both Ireland and Yorkshire should be taught to manage their purely\r\ninternal affairs to the best of their ability.\r\n\r\nBut, if exclusive Nationalism is essentially unsocialistic, what are\r\nwe to say of Imperialism? The answer is that there is nothing wrong\r\nwith Imperialism except the name which suggests Louis Bonaparte and\r\nthe dragooning of subject peoples. With the thing, in its British\r\nsense, Socialists have no kind of quarrel. Indeed if Socialists would\r\nonly give up their vague invectives against “Empire,” which lead in\r\nthe long run to nothing more than the unmeaning backing of the effete\r\nanti-imperialist, anti-socialist, anti-Church-and-State Radicalism\r\ncurrent fifty years ago, and seriously face the problems raised by\r\nBritish expansion from an unswervingly Socialist standpoint, we might\r\nget on a good deal faster. The problem of Imperialism (“Federationism”\r\nwould be a better word) may be briefly stated thus:--How can we\r\nconsolidate the widely scattered and variegated dominions which fly the\r\nBritish flag into one vast Commonwealth of practically international\r\nextent? Have Socialists any answer to this question? Or are they to be\r\ncontent with the old Radical answer that this cannot or should not be\r\ndone?\r\n\r\nThat any Socialist should return such answer is to me I confess\r\nastounding. To say that such a practically international commonwealth\r\nis impossible is to say that _a fortiori_ the international\r\ncommonwealth of which Marx and Lassalles dreamed is impossible.\r\nIf the proletarians of England and Ireland, Australia and South Africa,\r\nIndia and Canada cannot unite, what hope is there that those of France\r\nand Germany, Russia and Japan will do so. Surely it is a curious way\r\nof showing your enthusiasm for the Federation of the World to break\r\nup all existing federations into smaller and smaller divisions. The\r\npractical Socialist policy in relation to the Empire is clearly not to\r\ndestroy it, but to socialize it--that is to prevent its exploitation by\r\ncapitalist cliques and financial conspiracies, to organise it in the\r\ninterests of its inhabitants as a whole, and to use its power to check\r\nthe evil force and cunning of cosmopolitan finance.\r\n\r\nFor indeed the dark of deeds such finance can only, as we Socialists\r\nbelieve, be checked by the political force of the community. And in\r\norder to check it at all effectively the community must be operative\r\non a scale as large as its own. That is why the older Socialists were\r\ninternationalists; that is why so many of the more thoughtful of\r\nmodern Socialists are imperialists. Mr. Wells has pointed out at what\r\na serious disadvantage municipalities find themselves in dealing with\r\nprivate monopolies since the latter can operate over any area that is\r\nconvenient to them, while the operations of the former are confined\r\nwithin the narrow and arbitrary frontiers drawn by Acts of Parliament.\r\nExactly the same is true in international affairs. Mr. Beit and Mr.\r\nEckstein can safely snap their fingers at small nationalities, however\r\nprogressive. Against a Socialistic British Empire they would be utterly\r\npowerless.\r\n\r\nAnd as the organization of the Empire can be made the most powerful of\r\nSocialist weapons if we can once get control of it, so the popular\r\nsentiment of Imperialism can be used for the purposes of Socialist\r\npropaganda if we know how to turn it to account. For we Socialists\r\nalone possess the key to the problem--the key for which nonsocialist\r\nImperialists are looking. It is to be noted that as soon as the\r\nordinary Imperialist gets anywhere near the solution of an imperial\r\nquestion he gets unconsciously on to the Socialist track, as for\r\ninstance in the growing demand for the imperialisation of our great\r\ncarrying lines. Even Mr. Chamberlain’s propaganda, though Socialists\r\ncannot think it sufficient, is a sort of groping after the socialist\r\nsolution, an admission of the necessity of intervention by the\r\nunited British Commonwealth to check and regulate the disintegrating\r\nanarchy of commercial competition. In fact our word to the stupid and\r\nthoughtless Imperialism of the streets is in reality the word of St.\r\nPaul to the Athenians:--“What ye ignorantly worship that declare we\r\nunto you!”\r\n\r\nThe same general line of thought has its application to the problems\r\nof foreign policy. The old Cobdenite doctrine of non-intervention in\r\nthe affairs of other nations had its origin in Cobden’s general view\r\nof diplomacy as existing only to promote the interests of trade--by\r\nwhich of course he meant the interests of the merchant, manufacturer\r\nand capitalist. That cannot possibly be our view. For Socialists to\r\naccept the Liberal doctrine of non-intervention would amount to a\r\ndenial of that human solidarity of which they have always considered\r\nthemselves the especial champions. In point of fact Palmerston is a\r\nmuch better model for Socialists in regard to continental affairs\r\nthan Cobden or Bright or even Gladstone. For, though Gladstone was\r\ncertainly not a non-interventionist, his anti-Turkish monomania made\r\nhim blind to the evil power of Russia, whose existence is a standing\r\nmenace to liberty and progress, and whose power and vast resources\r\nmake her a more formidable enemy of all that we value than Turkey\r\ncould ever be if she tried. Socialists should press not merely for\r\nthe protection of our “proletarian” fishermen against the freaks of\r\ntipsy or panic-stricken Russian admirals, but for a steady policy of\r\nopposition to Russia all over the world and the support of any or every\r\nnation, Japs, Finns, Poles, Afghans and even the “unspeakable” Turk\r\nagainst her. During the perilous days through which we have recently\r\npassed, it must have occurred to many that our position would have\r\nbeen much stronger if we could have counted on the support of Turkey,\r\nas we could have done had we never abandoned, in deference to Mr.\r\nGladstone’s theological animosities, the policy of Palmerston and Lord\r\nStratford de Redcliffe--the policy of first reforming Turkish rule and\r\nthen guaranteeing it against Muscovite aggression. The only difference\r\nbetween our policy and Palmerston’s should be this, that while\r\nPalmerston confined himself to the encouragement of political liberty,\r\nwe ought to aim at the promotion of economic liberty also. We should in\r\nfact try to put England at the head of the Labour interest throughout\r\nthe world as Cromwell put her at the head of the Protestant interest,\r\nand Palmerston of the Liberal interest. And in doing this we should be\r\nprepared to make full use of those weapons which neither Cromwell nor\r\nPalmerston would ever have hesitated to employ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“MILITARISM AND AGGRESSION”\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are continually being told by Socialists of the hazier sort that\r\nLabour has no concern with the question of national defence. We have\r\nhad recently a considerable ebullition of this particular form of\r\nimbecility provoked by the efforts of one who has always seemed to\r\nme quite the sanest and most far-sighted of English Socialists, Mr.\r\nRobert Blatchford, to draw general attention to the importance of the\r\nsubject. Mr. Blatchford is in controversy very well able to take care\r\nof himself, and in this instance he has overwhelmed his critics with\r\nsuch a cannonade of satire, eloquence, indisputable logic and inspired\r\ncommon-sense that it would be quite impertinent of me to offer him my\r\nsupport. But the episode is so very typical of the ineffable silliness\r\nof “advanced” persons that I cannot pass it by without comment.\r\n\r\nAs to the contention so much favoured by those who have been assailing\r\nMr. Blatchford’s “militarism” that England is not worth defending and\r\nthat a foreign invasion would be no evil to the bulk of the people,\r\nthe position has been so thoroughly dismantled by “Nunquam’s” heavy\r\nartillery that I need hardly trouble about it here. As Mr. Blatchford\r\nsays, a few weeks of Prussian or Muscovite rule would probably be the\r\nbest cure for reformers of this type. But the whole argument is on the\r\nface of it absurd. That your country is badly governed is an excellent\r\nreason for changing your present rulers. But it is no reason at all for\r\nwelcoming (patriotism being for the moment set on one side) a cataclysm\r\nwhich would destroy good and bad alike--the good more completely than\r\nthe bad--and would inevitably throw back all hope of reform for\r\nat least a century. As well might a man say that, since London was\r\nadmittedly in many ways an ugly and horrible place, he proposed to vote\r\nfor the abolition of the fire-brigade.\r\n\r\nSo also with the very popular platitude which asserts that a peaceful\r\nand unaggressive people need not fear attack, and that, if we refrain\r\nfrom injuring our neighbours they will refrain from injuring us,\r\n(unless presumably we happen to be North Sea fishermen). The obvious\r\ncontroversial retort is that the people who maintain this doctrine\r\nare for the most part the very same who a little while ago were never\r\ntired of maintaining that the Boers were peaceful and unaggressive and\r\nlamenting that in spite of this their country was attacked, conquered\r\nand annexed by a powerful neighbour. Of course I do not accept this\r\naccount of the Boers, whom indeed I respect far too much to accuse\r\nof Tolstoian proclivities. But the point is plainly unanswerable\r\nfor those who do accept it. In any case the whole of the above lofty\r\ngeneralization is flatly contradicted by history and experience.\r\nIndeed, if the strong will not wantonly attack the weak, then is our\r\npreaching vain! Why are we Socialists? What is the good of Trade\r\nUnionism? The humane capitalists will not attack us if we remain\r\n“peaceful and unaggressive.” Perhaps not. As Mr. Hyndman (I think) once\r\nsaid:--One does not muzzle sheep! But, if there is anything which the\r\nwhole history of human institutions proves, it is this, that the people\r\nthat does not know how to defend its liberties will lose them, and that\r\nit is not the strong and aggressive nation but the weak and defenceless\r\nnation that has cause to dread aggression from its neighbours.\r\n\r\nIn a word the doctrine of non-resistance and its consequence, the\r\nabolition of armaments, is good Anarchism and may therefore in a sense\r\nbe called good Liberalism. But Socialism it is not and cannot be.\r\n\r\nThere is however, a position sometimes maintained by controversialists\r\nrather saner than those dealt with above. It is suggested that, while\r\nit may be admitted that an army of some sort is necessary, there\r\nare plenty of people already concerned with the promotion of its\r\nefficiency, and that Socialists, having other and more important work\r\nto do, had much better leave the question alone, intervening only to\r\nrestrain the militarists when their demands become excessive.\r\n\r\nNow to this contention there are as it seems to me three complete\r\nanswers. By far the most important objection to such a policy is\r\nthat it would make it permanently impossible for us to gain the\r\nconfidence of the electorate. The people of Great Britain (especially\r\nthe working classes) will always demand as the first condition of\r\nsupporting any government that it shall be able and willing to defend\r\nthe country against foreign aggression. No party which was not\r\nthought to fulfil this condition would find it possible to achieve\r\nor retain administrative power. And those of us whose desire is not\r\nto sit in arm chairs and read Tolstoi and congratulate ourselves\r\non the non-conformity of our consciences, but to get some sort of\r\nsocialism put into bricks and mortar, must feel the urgent necessity of\r\nconvincing the voters that we are trustworthy in this respect.\r\n\r\nMoreover if you leave the discussion of army reform to the\r\nrepresentatives of the landed and capitalist classes, such reforms\r\nas we get will be carried out exclusively in the interests of those\r\nclasses. At present our military and naval forces are officered and\r\ncontrolled by one class; they are an appendage of that class and will\r\nalways, so long as this is so, be employed successfully to protect its\r\ninterests. So long as the English people are asked to choose between\r\nsuch class army and the risk of a German invasion, they will choose\r\nthe former, but it by no means follows that they would do so were a\r\npracticable alternative placed before them.\r\n\r\nAnd this brings me to my third point. It so happens that for\r\nthe purpose of formulating an alternative, Socialists are in an\r\nexceptionally favoured position. Our army has by common consent\r\nbroken down. It is not even effective for the purposes for which the\r\ncapitalist classes want it. It is not only, as foolish people suppose,\r\nthe War Office that is decadent and inefficient; the army is decadent\r\nand inefficient. Our soldiers are perhaps the best raw material in\r\nthe world, but the whole machinery of war and defence is eaten up by\r\na corruption which is all the worse for being largely careless and\r\nunconscious. The two worst enemies of the British Army are the power of\r\nmoney and the power of caste. These are our enemies also. We Socialists\r\nalone are in a position to see what is really wrong. Would it not be\r\nworth our while to bring our best brains to bear upon the subject and\r\nsee whether our Socialism cannot provide us with a remedy.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the unfortunate prevalence of the sort of sentimentalism\r\nreferred to above, there have always been in the socialist movement\r\nwitnesses to the common-sense view of militarism. Here and there\r\nthroughout this volume I have been obliged to criticize the attitude\r\nof the Social Democratic Federation; I therefore admit the more gladly\r\nthat on this question that body has indubitably led the way. Its views\r\nare obtainable in the form of a remarkably able pamphlet[2] from\r\nthe pen of Mr. Quelch, wherein the old Liberal Quakerism is thrown\r\ncompletely overboard and the institution of universal citizen service\r\non something like the Swiss model put forward as the socialist solution\r\nof the problem of national defence. The Fabians followed in “Fabianism\r\nand the Empire,”[3] adopting a suggestion of Mr. and Mrs. Sidney Webb’s\r\nthat the half-time age in factories and workshops should be raised to\r\n21, and the time thus gained devoted to training in the use of modern\r\nweapons. Finally there is Mr. Robert Blatchford, whose plan is too\r\nelaborate to be detailed here--I refer my readers to his articles in\r\nthe _Clarion_ during July, August and September last year and to his\r\nforthcoming book on the subject--but whose cardinal demand is for an\r\nimmense increase in the numbers and efficiency of the volunteers, who\r\nare to form a citizen force of almost national dimensions. Of course\r\nthe Fabian programme and, I gather, Mr. Blatchford’s also imply the\r\nexistence of at any rate a small professional army in addition.\r\n\r\nNow it seems to me that the one defect of the S.D.F. plan is that,\r\nif I understand Mr. Quelch’s pamphlet rightly, it professes only to\r\nprovide a militia for the defence of these islands. That is to say it\r\ndoes not provide for the defence of our possessions in different parts\r\nof the world nor for any aggressive movement against the territory of\r\nthe power with which we chance to be at war; while even for purely\r\ndefensive purposes it is open to the grave military objections which\r\ncan always be urged against relying solely on irregular troops.\r\n\r\nI have already discussed the question of Imperialism and I need not\r\ngo into it again. But I suppose that all but the most fanatical\r\nLittle-Englanders, whatever their views on expansion, would admit that\r\nit is both our right and our duty to assist in the protection of our\r\nfellow-citizens in other parts of the world against unprovoked attack.\r\nIf, for example, Germany were to make a wanton attack on Australia, or\r\nRussia on India, or the United States on Canada, I suppose that every\r\nsensible Englishman would admit that we ought to come to the assistance\r\nof our fellow-countrymen. But in that case we shall want an army for\r\nforeign service as well as for home defence.\r\n\r\nThe other point needs rather more explanation because it is constantly\r\nmisunderstood by people who will not try to comprehend the nature of\r\nwar. Such persons are always confusing aggression in the political\r\nsense as the cause of war with aggression in the strategic sense as\r\na method of conducting it. A war may be waged solely for defensive\r\npurposes, yet it may be the right course from a military point of\r\nview to take the offensive. France found this in the wars of the\r\nrevolution; and Japan fighting (as I believe) for no other purpose than\r\nthe protection of her own independence against the lies of Russian\r\ndiplomacy and the brutalities of Russian power, has yet been obliged\r\nto conquer Korea, invade Manchuria, and lay siege to Port Arthur.\r\nSimilarly we might easily find ourselves engaged in a purely defensive\r\nwar with France or Germany, in which it might be still the only safe\r\npolicy to raid the territory and seize the over-sea possessions and\r\nespecially the coaling-stations of our enemies.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the distinction so often made between offensive and\r\ndefensive war is more theoretic than practical. It is seldom possible\r\nto say in the case of a modern war that either side is unmistakably\r\nattacking or defending. Which side was the aggressor in the Crimean\r\nor Franco-German wars? Are the Japs aggressors because it was they who\r\nactually declared war or are they only defending their country? The\r\nreal question to be asked is not which side is the aggressor, but which\r\nnation is so situated that its triumph will be beneficial to mankind as\r\na whole.\r\n\r\nLastly there are the serious disadvantages from a military standpoint\r\nof trusting to a citizen force alone. Experience seems to prove that\r\nsuch a force is suitable only to a certain kind of warfare. The example\r\nof the Boers to which Mr. Quelch appeals so confidently tells directly\r\nagainst him. The Boers doubtless did wonders in the way of guerrilla\r\nfighting and in the defence of strong positions, but they never\r\nfollowed up their successes effectively, and they had to waste a great\r\ndeal of time, when time was of the utmost value to them, in sitting\r\ndown before Ladysmith, Kimberley and Mafeking when a professional army\r\nof the same size would have taken all three by assault.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that we can get an excellent military policy for\r\nSocialists by a judicious combination of the three suggestions to which\r\nI have referred. Taking Mr. Webb’s plan first, let us by all means by a\r\nmodification of the Factory Acts (much needed for its own sake) train\r\nthe whole youthful population in the use of modern weapons--and not\r\nin the use of modern weapons alone but in the best physical exercises\r\navailable and above all in discipline, endurance and the military\r\nvirtues. Then, following Mr. Quelch and the S.D.F. we might keep them\r\nin training by periodic mobilizations on the Swiss pattern without\r\nsubjecting them to long periods of barrack life. From the large citizen\r\nforce so formed we ought to be able to pick by voluntary enlistment\r\na professional army which need not be very large, but which should\r\nbe well-paid, efficiently organised and prepared for any emergency.\r\nAnother and larger professional army would be needed for the defence of\r\ndistant dependencies such as India.\r\n\r\nThese forces must, of course, be constituted on a basis of equality of\r\nopportunity, efficiency and reliability and capacity to command being\r\nthe only passports to promotion and no bar being placed between the\r\nmost capable soldier, whatever his origin and the highest posts in the\r\narmy. From the purely military point of view this would be an enormous\r\nimprovement on the present system. It is worth noting that the two\r\narmies which, organised in an incredibly short space of time out of the\r\nrawest of materials, broke in pieces every force which could be put\r\ninto the field against them, the army of Cromwell and the army of the\r\nFirst Republic, were alike based on the principle of the “career open\r\nto talent.” So the policy which I suggest would, I sincerely believe,\r\nconvert our impossible army into one of the best fighting machines in\r\nthe world. Not only would the officers under such a system be more\r\ncapable than some of the fashionable commanders, whose glorious defeats\r\nand magnificent surrenders we were all eulogising five years ago, but\r\nbetter chances and a higher rate of pay would attract to the ranks of\r\nthe professional army the very best type of man for the purpose, which\r\nthe present system can hardly be said to do.\r\n\r\nBeyond this we want an effective General Staff and an Intelligence\r\nDepartment not only alert but strong enough to enforce its demands on\r\nthe government, as well as a complete overhauling of our war-machine\r\nboth on its civil and military side. But there is no space for details\r\nhere; Socialists could hardly do better than leave them to Mr.\r\nBlatchford to work out.[4]\r\n\r\nNo one who thinks seriously of the consequences of such a policy can\r\ndoubt that, if it could be carried out, it would effect a greater\r\ntransference of real power to the democracy than any Reform Bill. The\r\nobjection which most reformers instinctively feel to any proposal to\r\nincrease military establishments rests, I fancy, at bottom on their\r\nsense that such establishments are organized by a class to protect its\r\nnarrow class interests. So it is that British troops are found useful\r\nto British governments not only in Egypt and South Africa but also\r\nat Featherstone and Bethesda. With such a military organisation as I\r\nhave suggested this menace would disappear. Nay, the weights would\r\nbe transferred to the other scale. Nothing, I conceive, is so likely\r\nto put a little of the fear of God into the hearts of our Liberal\r\nand Conservative rulers as the knowledge that they have to deal with\r\na democratic army and a democracy trained in arms. This, I know,\r\nwill sound shockingly heterodox to idealistic persons who are fond\r\nof repeating (in defiance of universal human experience) the foolish\r\nmaxim of John Bright, the Quaker apologist for plutocratic Anarchism,\r\nthat “force is no remedy,” and the equally unhistorical statement that\r\n“violence always injures the cause of those who use it.” But practical\r\nmen pay little attention to such talk, knowing that nothing helps a\r\nstrike so much as a little timely rioting and that the most important\r\nreforms of the late century were only carried when it was known that\r\nthe mob of the great towns was “up.” As a matter of fact, force is\r\nthe _only_ remedy. If Socialism comes about, as I think it probably\r\nwill in this country, in the constitutional Fabian way, this will only\r\nmean that the Socialists will themselves have captured the control of\r\nthe army and the police and will then use them against the possessing\r\nclasses, forcing them to disgorge at the bayonet’s point. And, if it\r\ndoes not superficially wear this aspect, that will merely be because\r\nthe latter, seeing how invincible is the physical force arrayed against\r\nthem, may very likely surrender position after position at discretion\r\nuntil they find that they have no longer anything to defend.[5]\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked incidentally that social reform would receive a\r\nconsiderable impetus from such a policy. Not only would periodic\r\nmobilizations take the workers for a time out of the foetid atmosphere\r\nof their slums and factories and perhaps make them less contented to\r\nreturn, but the heads of the army would themselves be compelled to\r\nbecome social reformers and insist on some decent minimum of housing\r\nand factory conditions in order to keep up the physical efficiency of\r\nthe material of which they would have to make soldiers. Herr Molkenbuhr\r\nthe German Social-Democrat pointed out to the Socialist Congress at\r\nAmsterdam this year that this had happened in Germany even under an\r\nundemocratic and often really oppressive form of conscription. An\r\nimmense impetus given to housing and factory legislation would be\r\namong the by-products of Army Reform, if carried out on the right\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nI have left myself no space here to deal adequately with the Navy. I\r\nwill therefore pass it by here with the remark that an invincible navy\r\nis absolutely essential to the welfare of the workers of this country,\r\nwhose food comes almost entirely from overseas, and that the navy has\r\nnever been like the Army a menace to popular liberties. It is generally\r\nthought that our navy is in a much more efficient state than our army\r\nis known to be in; but a thorough overhauling would do it no harm\r\nand might expose weaknesses which we do not suspect. At any rate any\r\nattempt to weaken our naval predominance should be resolutely opposed\r\nby all Socialists as by all sensible men.\r\n\r\nOf course an effective army and navy will cost money. But the Socialist\r\nwill be by no means so frightened of high estimates as the old Radical\r\nwho regarded all taxation as being of the nature of a compromise with\r\nSatan. The Socialist knows that at least £600,000,000 a year goes at\r\npresent into the pockets of landlords and capitalists and shareholders\r\ngenerally, and, until this is absorbed, the cry of “ruinous\r\nexpenditure” cannot be expected to appall him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FETISH OF FREE TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet it not be supposed that I propose to argue the eternal Fiscal\r\nQuestion here. For the last twelve-month and more we have had quite\r\nenough flinging backward and forward of childish platitudes, scraps\r\nof obsolete economics, and masses of irrelevant and ill-digested\r\nfigures by both parties to the controversy. You are quite safe from\r\nfigure-shuffling as far as I am concerned, and you are equally safe\r\nfrom bodiless _a priori_ economics. For me, indeed, the question is\r\nnot one that can ever be decided on general principles. To ask whether\r\nnations ought to adopt Protection is exactly like asking whether men\r\nought to wear over-coats. Obviously in both instances the answer\r\ndepends on a number of attendant facts not stated--on the weather,\r\nthe constitution of the men, and the thickness of the coats in the one\r\ncase, on the character of the people, the distribution of their wealth,\r\nthe state of their commerce, and the character of the proposed tariff\r\nin the other. Tell me that you wish in certain specified circumstances\r\nto impose protective duties on certain specified imports, and I am\r\nwilling to examine the evidence and express an opinion. But so long\r\nas you put the issue as one of abstract principle, I must ask to be\r\nexcused from indulging in what seems to me an utterly barren and\r\nprofitless exercise in immaterial logic.\r\n\r\nOf course, as I have already insisted, there is a sense in which every\r\nSocialist is of necessity a Protectionist and Preferentialist. As Mr.\r\nBernard Shaw once expressed it, (I quote from memory) he believes\r\nthat the highest wisdom of governments is to know “what to protect\r\nand what to prefer.” For him the Utopia of “economic harmonies” is a\r\nfoolish and mischievous dream. He knows that the commercial instinct\r\nunless subjected to energetic and unsparing state supervision, is\r\ncertain to become a cause of ruinous social disorder. His whole mind\r\nwill be set to the task of regulating it, directing it, curbing its\r\nexcesses, and protecting the public interest against it. In a word the\r\nadvanced social reformer of the new school is necessarily an emphatic\r\nProtectionist, only differing from Mr. Chamberlain and his supporters\r\nin that he gives to the word “Protection” a wider scope and a fuller\r\nmeaning than they.\r\n\r\nNow it inevitably follows that there is not and cannot be any kind of\r\nobjection from his point of view to a protective tariff on grounds\r\nof principle. The theoretic objection which used to be urged against\r\nsuch a tariff was founded on the assumption that Adam Smith, Bastiat\r\nand others had demonstrated the futility and peril of all legislative\r\ninterference with commerce. Cobden put the whole case as he and his\r\nparty saw it in one phrase of one of his ablest speeches, when he\r\ndeclared that you could not by legislation add anything to the wealth\r\nof a nation. That is a doctrine which no one (save perhaps Mr. Auberon\r\nHerbert) now holds; which no one who approves for instance of any kind\r\nof factory legislation can possibly hold. And that doctrine once fairly\r\nout of the way, the question becomes simply one of expediency and the\r\nbalance of utilities.\r\n\r\nBut, when we come to the balancing, another point of divergence\r\ninstantly arises. The Socialists’ conception of utilities differs in\r\nessence from that of Free Traders and Protectionists alike. For Mr.\r\nChamberlain, for Mr. Morley, for the Tariff Reform League and for the\r\nCobden Club, the aim of commercial statesmanship is simply and solely\r\nto increase the aggregate commercial wealth of the country. But this is\r\nby no means what the Socialist is mainly concerned about. His object\r\nis not so much to increase the sum total of such wealth as to secure\r\nits better distribution and more socially profitable use. He sees that\r\nthe economic struggle between nations is by comparison a matter of\r\nsurface fluctuations, while the economic struggle between classes is an\r\nenduring and essential feature of our social system. And whether or no\r\nhe likes the old Marxian phrase “Class War,” he is bound to recognise\r\nthe existence of a class antagonism cutting right across society as a\r\nfact without the understanding of which the structure of capitalist\r\ncivilisation is unintelligible.\r\n\r\nThis implies that the Socialist, whether he be a “Free Trader” or\r\nno, has to dismiss as untenable practically the whole of the old\r\neconomic case for Free Trade. Adam Smith did doubtless prove that\r\nunder a system of absolutely free exchange, every country would tend\r\nto engage in those trades which were (for the moment at any rate)\r\nmost commercially profitable to it; but he never proved or attempted\r\nto prove that these would be the trades which were most socially\r\nbeneficent. It might, for example, happen that the White Lead trade\r\nproved the most commercially advantageous industry in which Englishmen\r\ncould engage. But would any modern reformer say that in that case it\r\nwould be well for us to abandon all our other industries and take to\r\nthe manufacture of white lead--with all its inevitable concomitants.\r\nIt may be urged that such a case is not likely to occur. But cases\r\ndiffering from it only in degree may very well occur--have indeed\r\noccurred already. Such a case is the decline of our agriculture and\r\nthe consequent flooding of the towns with cheap unskilled labour;\r\nsuch also is the tendency already more than faintly visible for\r\nsmall trades, largely unskilled and often sweated, to supplant our\r\nstaple industries. And these things, though they are the inevitable\r\nconsequence of unrestricted competition and though Cobden would have\r\nregarded them with complete equanimity, are the very things against\r\nwhich social reformers have for years been fighting a long and\r\napparently a hopeless battle. No Socialist can give them a moment’s\r\ntoleration. Whether Socialists will think Mr. Chamberlain’s remedy\r\nadequate is another thing. For Mr. Chamberlain’s point of view--a\r\npurely commercial one--is at bottom identical with that of his\r\nCobdenite opponents.\r\n\r\nAnd it is just this that makes mere statistics of trade and comparisons\r\nbetween imports and exports so barren and misleading. What we want to\r\nknow is not how much tribute the capitalist gets out of our foreign\r\ntrade, but what wages the labourer gets, what are the conditions under\r\nwhich he works, and what is the amount of employment available. Thus\r\nfor instance foreign investments pay the capitalist as well as British\r\ninvestments and are accordingly highly esteemed by the Cobdenites as\r\n“invisible exports.” But they are not equally satisfactory to the\r\nworkman who loses his job and drifts into the ranks of the unemployed.\r\nFrom this point of view Protection if it kept capital in the country\r\nand even attracted foreign capital might be eminently beneficial to\r\nthe workers, even though the aggregate of national wealth were thereby\r\ndiminished.\r\n\r\nNow we have reached two conclusions. Firstly that Socialists will\r\napproach the tariff question with an open mind; secondly that they will\r\napproach it mainly from the standpoint of its effect upon the social\r\ncondition of the people and upon the distribution of wealth.\r\n\r\nThat, I say, is what one would naturally expect Socialists to do.\r\nWhat the English Socialists and the leaders of organised labour in\r\nthis country have actually done is to fling their Socialism and their\r\n“class-consciousness” to the winds, to stampede once more into the\r\nLiberal camp (as they did before over South African affairs), to sing\r\npious hymns in honour of the memories of Bright and Cobden, oblivious\r\nof the former’s opposition to factory legislation and the latter’s\r\nfreely expressed detestation of trade unionism, to trot out for the\r\nconfusion of Mr. Chamberlain the very doctrines which Socialist\r\neconomists have spent the last fifty years in riddling with destructive\r\ncriticism, and generally to devote their energies to the hopeless task\r\nof strengthening the ruined fortifications which protect Liberalism\r\nfrom the attacks of the time-spirit.\r\n\r\nWhen the Fiscal Question first began to agitate the minds of Englishmen\r\nthe new-born Labour Party was in an unusually strong position. It was\r\nas yet uncommitted on the subject, and both sides would willingly\r\nhave paid a high price for its support. Nothing strikes one more in\r\nMr. Chamberlain’s early speeches than his evident anxiety to gain at\r\nall costs the sympathy of Labour. And the Liberals were at that time\r\nequally anxious. Had the leaders of British Trade Unionism followed the\r\nexcellent example set them by Mr. Redmond and the Irish Nationalists,\r\nhad they held their hands and said frankly to both combatants “What\r\nsocial reforms will you give us as the price of our support?”--what\r\nunprecedented pressure might they not have been able to exert! To Mr.\r\nChamberlain they might quite fairly have said “You say that ‘all is not\r\nwell with British Trade’: we agree with you, we have been saying so\r\nfor years. But before we accept your proposed remedies we want reliable\r\nguarantees that the working classes shall not be the sufferers. Tack\r\non to your programme a maximum price for bread (or some system of\r\nmunicipal bakeries which would achieve the same object) and a minimum\r\nwage for labour, and we will consider them.” To the Liberals again\r\nthey could have said “You tell us that Mr. Chamberlain’s policy will\r\nnot remedy the evils to which he rightly draws attention; granted,\r\nbut what is your remedy? If we help you to resist these proposals\r\nwhat drastic measures are you ready to propose for dealing with the\r\nunemployed and kindred problems?” Had they taken this line, they might\r\nhave achieved much. But, having the game in their hands, the labour\r\nleaders deliberately threw all their cards away. Directly the question\r\nof fiscal reform was mooted, without waiting for any pledge from\r\neither party, they began to violently espouse one side and violently\r\ndenounce the other. By this they fruitlessly abandoned their excellent\r\nstrategic position. Mr. Chamberlain, seeing that he had nothing to hope\r\nfrom them, treated them as enemies and organised the Tariff Reform\r\nmovement frankly as a purely capitalist affair, leaving Labour out of\r\naccount in the formation of his celebrated Commission as completely as\r\nCobden himself left it out of account in the formation of the Anti-Corn\r\nLaw League. The Liberals on the other hand are not so foolish as to\r\ngive pledges to those who do not ask for them, so that the opposition\r\nto Mr. Chamberlain is as completely capitalist-ridden as is his own\r\npropaganda. Thus, instead of standing to win either way, Labour now\r\nstands to lose either way. Should Mr. Chamberlain succeed, as he very\r\nwell may, if not at this election at the one after it, his tariff will\r\nbe framed by powerful organisations representing capital and finance,\r\nwho will naturally follow their own pecuniary interests. Should the\r\nOpposition triumph they will come into power quite unpledged, save\r\nto Lord Rosebery’s programme of “commercial repose” which is the\r\nnewest name for our old friend “laissez faire.” And we shall be unable\r\nto make use of the stir made by Mr. Chamberlain’s agitation, as we\r\nmight well have done had we acted wisely, in order to get measures\r\nwhich we really do want and which are in some sense of the nature\r\nof counter-remedies--the nationalisation of railways, an imperial\r\nshipping fleet with preferential rates, and the re-organisation of our\r\nagriculture by state aid and state supervision.\r\n\r\nBut there are reasons other than tactical ones why Labour should have\r\nrefused to adopt the Liberal attitude of non-possumus in regard to\r\nfiscal reform. Whether or no Mr. Chamberlain’s tariff scheme would\r\nhave been favourable to the interests of labour,[6] there are a great\r\nmany proposals which are clearly and unmistakeably in its interests\r\nwhich are yet in their nature protectionist even in the narrow sense in\r\nwhich that word is ordinarily used.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of the Liberal party that even when it has dropped\r\naccidentally across a right conclusion it invariably seizes with great\r\neagerness upon the wrong reasons for supporting it. The most striking\r\nexample of this is to be found in the case of Chinese Labour. For\r\nmyself, I detest Chinese Labour, and am prepared to go, I fancy, a\r\ngood deal further than the Liberal front bench in fighting it. But\r\nthen I am a Protectionist; and I believe that a plentiful supply of\r\ncheap labour is the worst curse with which a nation can be visited.\r\nThe Liberals and their Labour henchmen, precluded by reason of their\r\nFree Trade orthodoxies from taking up this sane and tenable position,\r\nhave to devote their energies to denouncing the “slavery” involved in\r\nthe conditions of the Ordinance. Now no Socialist can be expected to\r\nget very excited on this point. He hates slavery, but he recognises\r\nthat in one form or another it is an inherent part of the capitalist\r\nsystem, and the difference between telling a man that he must work\r\nfor his master or be imprisoned and telling him that he must work for\r\nhis master or be starved, can hardly seem to him important enough to\r\nmake all this fuss about. Moreover “forced labour” is implicit in the\r\nSocialist ideal, though most of us would prefer to begin by applying\r\nit to the Rand shareholders. As a matter of fact the conditions of\r\nthe Ordinance are a mitigation of the evils resulting from Chinese\r\nLabour, not an aggravation of them. They serve to circumscribe to some\r\nextent the limits of the damage which the imported Chinaman can do. My\r\nobjection to them is that I do not for one moment believe that they\r\ncan be made effective. But the danger of denouncing the conditions\r\nof importation instead of denouncing the importation itself, is that\r\none of these days our Hebrew masters will say to us:--“Very well. You\r\nobject to conditions; you shall have none. We will import Chinamen\r\nfreely and without restriction, and they shall supplant white men,\r\nnot in the mines only, but in every industry throughout South Africa.\r\nWe shall reap still larger dividends, and the danger of a white\r\nproletariat will be still more remote. Now we hope you are satisfied.”\r\nWhat will our Free Trade Labourites say then?\r\n\r\nA less serious but more amusing example of the shifts to which trade\r\nunion leaders are sometimes reduced in their efforts to reconcile the\r\nobvious interests of the workers with their holy and sacred “Free Trade\r\nPrinciples” was afforded by an episode which took place at the Leeds\r\nTrade Union Congress last year. It appears that in certain mines in\r\nthese islands the capitalists have taken to employing foreign unskilled\r\nlabour. Their motives are doubtless the same as those of the Rand\r\nmagnates, namely to bring down the price of labour all round by the\r\ncompetition of indigent Poles and Italians with the fairly well-paid\r\nworkers of this country. It was a very natural thing for capitalists\r\nto do; it was an equally natural thing for workmen to resist. They are\r\nresisting and a resolution was proposed at the Congress condemning the\r\nemployment of foreign unskilled labour in the mines. So far so good;\r\nbut now comes the comedy of the situation. To exclude the foreigner\r\nas a foreigner is clearly protection of the most bare-faced kind; and\r\nthe proposal had to be recommended to a body which had just declared\r\nin favour of unmitigated Free Trade. Then some genius had an almost\r\nmiraculous inspiration. It was suggested that the foreigner ought\r\nto be excluded, not because he was a foreigner, not even because\r\nhis labour was cheap, but because he could not read the Home Office\r\nregulations which are hung up in the mines. The plea was eagerly\r\nclutched at, and seems to have been received with all solemnity.\r\nThe correspondent of the _Daily News_ who had at first regarded the\r\nresolution with natural suspicion felt all his scruples vanish, and\r\nactually hailed the declaration as proof of the unflinching Cobdenism\r\nof the workers. Now what I want to know is--does anyone, does the\r\n_Daily News_ correspondent himself really believe in the sincerity of\r\nthis ridiculous excuse? Would the British miners have been satisfied\r\nif the regulations were printed in Polish or Italian? Or, supposing\r\nthis to be impossible, would they be satisfied if the immigrants learnt\r\nenough English to read them? Of course they would not. The objection\r\nto foreign unskilled labour is a purely protectionist objection, as\r\ninconsistent with Free Trade as anything proposed by Mr. Chamberlain. I\r\nmay add that it has my entire sympathy.\r\n\r\nVery soon, much sooner I think than they suppose, the leaders of\r\norganised labour will be forced by the sheer pressure of events to\r\nthrow “free trade principles” over-board and find another foundation\r\nfor their economic faith. For buying in the cheapest market clearly\r\nimplies buying labour in the cheapest market; and the capitalists will\r\nnot be slow to grasp its consequences at a time when the expansion\r\nof European civilisation is every day throwing new drafts of cheap\r\nlabour on the market. Less developed races with a lower standard of\r\nlife are exceedingly useful weapons to the hand of the capitalist\r\neager to force down wages. Already the appearance of the Chinaman in\r\nSouth Africa is parallelled on the other side of the Atlantic by the\r\nemployment of negro blacklegs to defeat the Colorado strikers. What\r\nhas happened in Africa and America may happen--is indeed beginning to\r\nhappen here. Are the labour leaders prepared to go on defending Free\r\nTrade, if Free Trade should prove to mean the free importation of great\r\nmasses of cheap blackleg labour from Poland, Italy and China? And, if\r\nthey so far abandon Free Trade as to shut out such labour, what about\r\nthe goods which it produces? Suppose the capitalist, forbidden to bring\r\nthe Chinaman here, take to exploiting him in his own country, relying\r\non our policy of free imports to secure the admission of his sweated\r\ngoods. Will not the champions of labour begin to regard the question of\r\nfree imports in a different light? The slope is steep and slippery and\r\nthe end is--Protection!\r\n\r\nYes the Labour party will have in the end to become protectionist.\r\nAlready progressive municipalities do not buy in the cheapest market\r\nbut in the best market, regard being had to the remote social\r\nconsequences of the purchase. And since the home market is the only\r\none where they can exercise any real or effective supervision over the\r\nconditions of production, we have the curious spectacle of local bodies\r\nwith a big Liberal majority forced into what is in effect a policy of\r\nProtection by the protests of unimpeachable Free Trade Labourites such\r\nas Mr. Steadman. Of course the new Protectionism will not be that of\r\nLord George Bentinck or even of Mr. Chamberlain. It will “protect”\r\nnot the landlord or the capitalist but the labourer and if to this end\r\nimport duties are found useful it will make no more fuss about imposing\r\nthem than any other necessary piece of state intervention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOWARDS ANARCHISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is an entertaining story told (I know not with exactly how much\r\naccuracy) of a well-known Liberal trade unionist, who has recently\r\nbecome a Member of Parliament. He is a typical labour leader of the\r\nlast generation, a Liberal in politics, a Nonconformist in religion,\r\na deacon (I understand) of his native chapel, a veritable pillar of\r\nproletarian respectability, and an unflinching opponent of Socialism in\r\nevery shape and form. Once it was his duty to attend an international\r\ncongress of the representatives of his trade, where he found, I should\r\nsuppose, the revolutionary trade unionism of the Continent little to\r\nhis taste. However, that may have been, a resolution was proposed at\r\nthe congress in question demanding a statutary eight hours day. This\r\nreputable and independent Briton rose to oppose it, and in so doing\r\nmade a characteristic Liberal speech, recommending the workmen to\r\nrely on themselves, not to appeal to governments, to win what they\r\ndesired by their own efforts, and so on. Somewhat to his own surprise,\r\nthe speech on being translated was greeted with no inconsiderable\r\napplause--applause which at the conclusion of his fine peroration\r\nbecame thunderous, and was mingled with enthusiastic shouts of “Vive\r\nJ---- et l’Anarchie!” He had unfortunately succeeded in conveying the\r\nimpression that by such phrases as “rely upon your own efforts” he\r\nmeant to indicate the throwing of bombs!\r\n\r\nThis story gains considerably in point by the events of the last two\r\nyears. For, during that period, the kinship (always innate) between\r\nLiberalism and Anarchism has been made apparent to the whole world in a\r\nmost startling manner; and we have seen the Nonconformist section of\r\nthe Liberal party, a section which above all others has always claimed\r\nan almost hypochondriac tenderness of conscience, trying to affect the\r\nrepeal of a measure to which it takes exception, by means of a campaign\r\nwhich involves nothing less than a cynical repudiation of the duties of\r\ncitizenship and an anarchic war against human society.\r\n\r\nAnyone who possesses a temperament sardonic enough to enable him\r\nto take pleasure in tracing the moral _débacle_ of what was once a\r\ngreat party can hardly amuse himself better than by following the\r\nhistory of the campaign against the Education Acts both before and\r\nafter they became law. No one burdened with much moral or social\r\nenthusiasm will be able to do so with sufficient calm, for I venture\r\nto assert that a more disgraceful debauch of cant, hypocrisy, flagrant\r\nmisrepresentation amounting sometimes to flat lying, sectarian venom,\r\nthe prostitution of religious excitement to base ends, all exploited\r\nwith an utterly shameless disregard of the public interest, cannot be\r\nfound in the records of English politics for the last century or more.\r\n\r\nThat is a strong statement; to support it let me recall the facts\r\nof the case. First I would ask a fair-minded man to glance through\r\nsome of the innumerable letters and articles which have flooded the\r\nNonconformist and Radical press from the first introduction of the\r\nEducation Bill down to the present time, and I would ask such a man\r\nto say what, taking his impressions from this source alone, he would\r\nhave supposed the purport of that Bill to be. I think I may say without\r\nthe slightest exaggeration that he would imagine that its effect must\r\nbe (1) to hand over _all_ elementary schools to the Church of England\r\nto be disposed of at her pleasure, (2) to impose on all teachers in\r\nsuch schools a new and stringent religious test, whose effect would\r\nbe to prevent any but Anglican (and perhaps Roman Catholic) teachers\r\nfrom obtaining employment. I do not think there is any exaggeration in\r\nthe above plain summary. On every side one still hears phrases like\r\n“handing over the schools of the nation to the Church,” “imposing a\r\nreligious test on teachers,” “giving the People’s property to the\r\nPriest,” “establishing clericalism in the public schools,” etc., which\r\ncan have no other rational meaning than that stated above. Now it is\r\nnot a matter of argument but one of simple fact that the Education\r\nAct did nothing of the kind,--that nothing of the kind has ever been\r\nproposed in the whole course of the controversy. What the Act did\r\ndo was (1) to give effect in denominational schools (already mainly\r\nsupported out of public funds) to an enormously increased measure of\r\npublic control, where before clerical control had been unbridled (2)\r\nto mitigate largely the effect of such religious “tests” as can in any\r\nsense be said to have existed in such schools. No new “test” of any\r\nsort or kind was imposed, and the Provided or Board Schools remain of\r\ncourse entirely unaffected except as to their transference from one\r\npublicly elected and unsectarian body to another and far more efficient\r\none.\r\n\r\nConsider for one moment the state of affairs which prevailed before\r\nthe passing of the Act. There were then two kinds of public elementary\r\nschool recognised by the State--the Board School and the Voluntary\r\nSchool. Schools of the former type were under the control of School\r\nBoards, bodies of irregular distribution and greatly varying\r\nimportance. It must always be remembered that throughout more than\r\nhalf of England there were no School Boards at all. In the big towns\r\nyou had doubtless often enough large and efficient Boards administering\r\nelementary education over the areas of great cities like London,\r\nGlasgow and Birmingham. In the country districts when they existed at\r\nall, the Boards were often elected to govern ridiculously small areas\r\n(sometimes with only one school in a whole district) and were most\r\ncommonly inefficient and reactionary.\r\n\r\nSuch was the situation of the Board Schools: that of the Voluntary\r\nSchools was still more impossible. These schools, founded originally\r\non denominational lines, were controlled despotically by a private\r\nboard of clerical or clerically-minded managers. No effective public\r\ncontrol was insisted upon. Even where a voluntary school was situated\r\nwithin a school board area, the School Board had no shadow of authority\r\nover it. And, as I have already mentioned, rather less than half of\r\nEngland possessed School Boards at all. The only pretence of public\r\nsupervision then existing in the case of voluntary schools was to be\r\nfound in the infrequent visits of notoriously complacent inspectors\r\nfrom Whitehall. Indeed the inspectors had to be complacent, for few\r\nvoluntary schools had the means to make themselves educationally\r\nefficient even though they might wish to do so. Though more than two\r\nthirds of the money spent on their upkeep came out of the public\r\nexchequer in the form of government grants, the remaining third had\r\nto be raised by private subscription, that is to say had to be begged\r\nvigorously from the most incongruous people, from Churchmen anxious to\r\npreserve definite theological teaching and from rich ratepayers and\r\neven Railway Companies anxious to avoid the incidence of a School Board\r\nrate. As a natural consequence the schools which, be it remembered,\r\nwere reckoned as part of the national machinery for education, were\r\ncounted in the statistics of school accommodation, and were indeed the\r\nonly schools available for a considerable part of the child population,\r\nwere in a state of chronic and hopeless beggary, and dragged on a\r\nmiserable existence,--starved, irresponsible, notoriously inefficient,\r\nyet practically safe from public intervention.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile technical education, unnaturally divorced from elementary,\r\nwas confided to the care of the County and Borough Councils. Secondary\r\neducation was nobody’s business. It would have been entirely neglected\r\nhad not some progressive School Boards stretched the term “elementary”\r\nto cover as much as they could until sharply pulled up by the Cockerton\r\njudgment, while some of the more progressive Councils stretched the\r\nterm “technical” in much the same way, and would probably, but for the\r\nintervention of the Act, have met with the same fate.\r\n\r\nNow what did the Education Acts do? The first and by far the most\r\nimportant change which they made was to transfer all education to the\r\nCounty and Borough Councils.[7] The effect of this was to provide that\r\nin future there should be everywhere throughout England one popularly\r\nelected local authority responsible for every kind and grade of\r\neducation within its administrative area, and that this body should\r\nbe that responsible for local government as a whole. Thus they made\r\npossible for the first time the co-ordination of all forms of education\r\nand the co-ordination of education with other municipal and local\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nThis change had of course the effect of sweeping away the old system of\r\nelecting educational authorities _ad hoc_. This seems to have struck\r\nmany people as a flagrant piece of injustice, an impudent repudiation\r\nof democracy, and a shameless invasion of popular rights. It is\r\ndifficult to understand why. A County or Borough Council is fully as\r\ndemocratic a body as a School Board, if democratic be taken to mean\r\nelected by popular suffrages. And if it is seriously contended that\r\na body ought to be specially elected to deal with education alone,\r\nbecause the issues at a general municipal election may be confused,\r\nwhy not carry the principle further and have _ad hoc_ bodies for each\r\nbranch of local activity? Indeed why should the principle be applied\r\nonly to local affairs? Why not elect a separate Parliament to deal with\r\nforeign affairs, another to deal with Colonial matters, another to deal\r\nwith social reform and so on? The fact is that the much vaunted _ad\r\nhoc_ principle never had any real existence. It is not contained, as\r\nNonconformists and Radicals seem to imagine either in the Bible or in\r\nMagna Charta; it is no part of the Natural Rights of Man or the Social\r\nContract or even of the British Constitution. It is nothing but the\r\nlast relic of a thoroughly discredited system of local government.\r\nThe framers of the Education Act of 1870 themselves knew of no such\r\nprinciple. They created _ad hoc_ bodies to deal with education, simply\r\nbecause government was then so undeveloped in this country that there\r\nwas no other body to which it could be entrusted. County Councils\r\ndid not then exist; the Local Government Act of 1889, which like the\r\nEducation Act of 1902 we owe to a Tory government, had not yet been\r\npassed. Over the greater part of England there was no democratic local\r\ngovernment at all. Therefore it was necessary to create a stop-gap\r\nauthority to deal with education. Similarly there were in the earlier\r\npart of the century innumerable other _ad hoc_ bodies, entrusted with\r\nthe duties of lighting the streets, making public improvements, etc.,\r\nbut they have all been swept away and their powers absorbed by county,\r\nborough, town, district or parish council. In course of time it was\r\ninevitable that the obsolete School Boards should follow them into the\r\nlimbo of rejected experiments. It now only remains for Parliament to\r\ncomplete its work by abolishing our hopeless and discredited Boards of\r\nGuardians.\r\n\r\nI suppose I ought in passing to refer to the contention that the\r\nadministrative machinery of the Acts is undemocratic because the\r\nCouncils are to govern through Committees. The absurdity of such a\r\nview will be obvious to anyone acquainted with the machinery of local\r\ngovernment. All local bodies act through committees in educational and\r\nother matters. The Committee is a purely executive body, absolutely\r\nsubject to the authority which creates it; and in this respect there is\r\nno essential difference between the Education Committee and that which\r\ncontrols the trams, the parks or the music halls.\r\n\r\nTo return to the other provisions of the Acts of 1902-3. The second\r\neffect which they have is to give to the local authority complete\r\ncontrol over the “Voluntary” Schools--now called Non-Provided\r\nSchools--in all matters relating to secular education. This, I know\r\nwell, will sound an audacious statement in the ears of those who\r\nhave taken their views from the declarations of the Liberal press. I\r\ncan only recommend such people to buy a copy of the Act and read it\r\nfor themselves. They will find that the managers of the non-provided\r\nschools are expressly compelled to carry out any instructions of the\r\nlocal education authority in regard to secular education, that in the\r\nevent of failure to do so they can by a single stroke be deprived of\r\nall the benefits of the Act, and that the authority has two nominated\r\nrepresentatives on the board of managers who are responsible to the\r\npublic alone and can at once appeal to the public authority should\r\ntheir denominational colleagues show symptoms of recalcitrance.\r\n\r\nLastly all the cost of maintaining these schools (except for the upkeep\r\nof the buildings) is to come from public funds, the balance once borne\r\nby private subscriptions now coming out of the rates (bear in mind that\r\nalready two thirds of their income was derived from taxes) so that a\r\ngreat nation is no longer placed in the humiliating position of having\r\nto rely on private charity in order to meet its educational needs,\r\nwhile denominational schools will no longer be able to plead beggary as\r\nan excuse for inefficiency.\r\n\r\nThat in plain English is what the Education Act of 1902 and the\r\nLondon Education Act of 1903 have effected. I defy any Liberal\r\nor Nonconformist opponent of the measure to show that I have\r\nmisrepresented their purport in any particular.\r\n\r\nBut no sooner was the first draft of the Bill before the country than\r\nthe campaign of unscrupulous mis-statement began. The loudest and most\r\npopular cry was that the Bill “imposed” a religious test on teachers.\r\nI remember once at a public debate asking a gentleman who urged this\r\nwith great rhetorical effect to point out to me the Clause of the Bill\r\nwhich imposed such a test. There upon I experienced the keen pleasure\r\nof watching my antagonists struggle through a copy of the Bill in the\r\nhopeless endeavour to find such a clause. Of course he did not find it\r\nfor the same reason which prevented Tilburina from seeing the Spanish\r\nFleet. There is no religious test imposed by the Act. Its sole effect\r\nin this respect is firstly to introduce an elective and nonsectarian\r\nelement into the body which appoints the teacher and secondly to allow\r\nthat body to over-ride any religious test imposed upon assistant\r\nteachers by the Trust-deeds of the school.\r\n\r\nThen came the cry that the “People’s Schools” were being “handed over\r\nto the Priest.” What this meant I cannot conceive. The reference could\r\nhardly be to the denominational schools which before the passing of\r\nthe Act were absolutely under the control of the “Priest” while under\r\nthe Act his control is to say the least of a very shadowy and much\r\nmitigated character. I am therefore forced to the conclusion that those\r\nwho used the phrase really supposed--or at any rate wished others to\r\nsuppose--that the Board Schools were handed over to the Church, which\r\nis of course so monstrously untrue, so devoid of even the faintest\r\nshadow of foundation in fact, that it is difficult to put it on paper\r\nwithout laughing.\r\n\r\nThere is, so far as I can see, no escape from one of these conclusions.\r\nEither the Nonconformists who made use of these catch-words and of\r\nmany others like them had never read the Education Acts, or they were\r\nincapable of understanding the plainest English, or, having read the\r\nActs and knowing their purport they deliberately misrepresented them.\r\nTake which ever explanation you choose:--are they men whom we can\r\nsafely trust with political power?\r\n\r\nLater the agitation passed through another phase. After flagrant\r\nmisrepresentation came nauseous cant and fantastic casuistry. I believe\r\nthat the English Nonconformists profess a great horror of Jesuits. But\r\nnothing attributed to the latter in the fiercest of Pascal’s satires\r\ncan equal the extraordinary casuistical _tour de force_ whereby the\r\nformer tried to find a distinction between the payment of rates and\r\nthe payment of taxes. With one voice the Nonconformists declared that\r\nit would sear their consciences as with a hot iron if they had to pay\r\na penny towards the support of schools where “Romanising” teaching was\r\ngiven. Whereto sensible men replied by pointing out that for years the\r\nNonconformists had been paying for the cost of such schools out of the\r\ntaxes. Then it was that the new ethical principle was discovered. It\r\nappears to be as follows:--_It is not wrong to pay money to a national\r\nbody to meet the cost of supporting Denominational Schools but it\r\nis wrong to pay money to a local body for the same purpose._ I will\r\nnot attempt to follow the various lines of argument by which this\r\nremarkable conclusion is reached. I merely set down the conclusion\r\nitself for the amusement of my readers.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered moreover that all the time that they were\r\nranting about “Rome on the Rates” and the wickedness of compelling\r\nDissenters to pay for teaching in which they did not believe the\r\nNonconformists were themselves forcing on the provided schools and\r\nendeavouring to force on all schools a form of religious instruction\r\nnotoriously abhorrent to Anglicans (at any rate of the Catholic type),\r\nRomanists, Agnostics and Jews. Could sanctified hypocrisy go further?\r\n\r\nYes, it could and did! No sooner was the Education Bill law than the\r\nleaders of Nonconformity with Dr. Clifford at their head entered upon\r\nthe _Opera Bouffe_ rebellion (mischievous enough despite its silliness)\r\nknown as “Passive Resistance.” That is to say that, fortified by\r\nthe magnificent ethical principle italicised above, they considered\r\nthemselves justified in repudiating their plain duties as citizens in\r\nthe hope that by so doing they might injure the educational machinery\r\nof the country. The form which their very prudent insurrection took was\r\nthat of refusing to pay their rates and compelling the community to\r\ndistrain on their goods.\r\n\r\nWith the manifold humours of the movement, with the sale of Dr.\r\nClifford’s trowels and the sad fate of his bust of Cromwell, with the\r\nevident eagerness of our Nonconformist martyrs to part with their\r\nBibles at the earliest possible moment, with the diurnal letters of Dr.\r\nClifford to the _Daily News_, with his just anger against the brutal\r\nauthorities who let a “resister” out of prison, with the even more\r\ndelicious letters of minor lights of Dissent, with the fear expressed\r\nby one of these lest his heroic action should be supposed by the\r\ncold world to be merely an economic distraint for rent,[8] with the\r\nolympian wrath of those aspirants for the martyr’s crown who found\r\ntheir hopes blighted by the baseness of some unknown person who had\r\ncruelly paid their rates for them--with none of these do I propose to\r\ndeal. Doubtless the proceedings of these brave martyr-rebels, whose\r\nmotto, like that of the conspirators in one of Mr. Gilbert’s operas,\r\n“is Revenge without Anxiety--that is without unnecessary Risk,” are\r\ndelightful, if regarded from the standpoint of humour. It is to be\r\nregretted that we cannot altogether afford so to regard them. No\r\nChristian can free himself from a sense of shame at seeing Christian\r\nbodies sink so low, nor can any patriotic Englishman, whatever his\r\ncreed, watch the signs of the times without anxiety when he sees what\r\nwas once a great English party flatter such men and condone such a\r\npolicy.\r\n\r\nSeriously considered the “Passive Resistance” campaign proved\r\ntwo things. The immense impetus which it has gained among the\r\nNonconformists is a symptom of that utter disregard of the public\r\ninterest which has in all ages been characteristic of political\r\nsectaries. The toleration, if not encouragement, of it by the bulk\r\nof the Liberal party shows how superficial is the conversion of\r\nLiberals from their former anarchic view of civic duty. For “Passive\r\nResistance” cannot be justified except the philosophic doctrines and\r\nassumptions of Anarchism be first accepted. Mr. Auberon Herbert might\r\nbe a passive resister without inconsistency, for he regards taxation as\r\na mere subscription sent by the subscriber to an organisation of his\r\nown choice and to be used only for such purposes as he may approve.\r\nHe therefore maintains that all taxes should be voluntary and, were\r\nhe to “resist” at all, would doubtless resist in the case of all\r\nstate expenditure which he may think undesirable,--armaments, wars,\r\nstate ceremonial, and even municipal enterprise. Now this theory,\r\nif once accepted, will tell much more against the progressive side\r\nthan against the reactionaries. The Nonconformists are as likely as\r\nnot, I imagine, to “resist” the payment of money required to start a\r\nmunicipal public house; taking example from them, other persons may\r\nresist payment of taxes needed to furnish old age pensions on the\r\nground that their consciences forbid them to allow their money to be\r\nused for the discouragement of the virtue of thrift. In a word the\r\nonly logical conclusion of the “passive resistance” policy is complete\r\nAnarchism--Anarchism from which the Liberal ideal sprang and in which\r\nit will end.\r\n\r\nFor us Collectivists, of course, the problem does not arise at all.\r\nFrom our point of view it is not Dr. Clifford’s money that is going\r\nto support Roman Catholic schools, but some of the money which the\r\ncommunity allows Dr. Clifford to handle subject to certain conditions,\r\none of which is that he should pay his contribution towards the general\r\nexpenses of government. If he does not like the use made of it, he has\r\nhis vote as a citizen and such influence as his abilities may command,\r\nand that is all he is entitled to. That is the case against Passive\r\nResistance, and I can only say that, if it is invalid, the whole case\r\nfor taxation is invalid also.\r\n\r\nFinally what strikes one most about this propaganda is its utterly\r\ncruel and cynical carelessness of the interests of the children. At\r\na time, when education is so necessary to our national existence, it\r\nis no light thing when a deliberate attempt is made by responsible\r\ncitizens to wreck our educational machinery in the interest of a\r\ngroup of sects. This is no exaggeration. We are told explicitly that\r\nthe object of the agitation is to make the Education Act unworkable,\r\nthat is to say to make it impossible to educate the children properly.\r\nHow far in this direction the leaders of the movement are prepared to\r\ngo may be seen from the case of Wales, where they are dominant and\r\ncan act as they please. There they have formulated a policy whereby\r\nthe deliberate ruin of Welsh education will be brought about by Welsh\r\n“patriots,” the object being to defeat what they are pleased to call\r\nthe “Welsh Coercion Act,” which of course is not a Coercion Act at all,\r\nbut merely an Act making provision for the upkeep of the children’s\r\nschools in cases where local authorities neglect their duties and leave\r\nthe unfortunate children fireless and bookless. I could wish that the\r\nNonconformist leaders, who are so fond of the “Open Bible” would\r\ndevote a little attention to Matthew XVIII 6.\r\n\r\nWhere it will all end no-one can say. Given favourable circumstances\r\nand a fair and firm administration of the law, I believe “Passive\r\nResistance” in all its forms would soon die of its own inanity. The\r\nDissenting Anarchists failed to capture the L.C.C. thanks to the\r\npatriotism and good sense of the Progressives at whom they have been\r\nsnarling ever since; and it hardly seems as if, outside Wales, they\r\nwould achieve much in the arena of municipal politics. In Wales, where\r\nthey have perhaps a slightly stronger case, some compromise might\r\nbe effective,--the proposals of the Bishop of St. Asaphs might form\r\na basis for discussion. But, of course, the whole situation would\r\nbe profoundly changed, were a Parliament dominated by Dissent to be\r\nreturned at the General Election. In that case the settlement of\r\n1902 would be upset, whole question would be flung once more into\r\nthe melting pot, and our educational system would be fought for by\r\nChurchmen and Dissenters, as two ill-tempered dogs fight for a bone.\r\nThat is what is quite likely to happen if we are not very careful, and\r\nserious educationalists can only look to the future with anxiety and\r\ndisquiet. Though perhaps in the last resort we can rely on the House of\r\nLords!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR BRITISH MOSLEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no wish to say anything disrespectful of the religion of Islam.\r\nIn many respects it is a very good religion; without doubt it is a\r\ngreat one and one of the most vigorous in the world. It is said still\r\nto make more converts annually than any other. It reigns unchallenged\r\nfrom Morocco to Persia, it is dominant throughout a large part of\r\nIndia, and is spreading more and more every year amongst the wild\r\ntribes of Central Africa and the islanders of the Malay Peninsular. In\r\nthis country the orthodox Mohammedan creed has made but little headway;\r\nnevertheless a number of more or less heretical Moslem sects, among\r\nwhich the Wesleyans, the Baptists, and the Congregationalists are\r\nperhaps the most important, flourish there exceedingly and, if not on\r\nthe increase, are at least fairly holding their ground.\r\n\r\nOne of the basic moral tenets of the Moslem faith is, as everyone\r\nknows, the prohibition of alcohol, and this tenet, despite doctrinal\r\nvariations, is held with equal firmness by the English sects above\r\nmentioned. The analogy is not a fanciful one; I express it in this\r\nway because I wish to emphasize the fact that the objection of the\r\n_Daily News_ and of those whose views it represents to beer and\r\nspirit drinking is an objection not to the social evils inseparable\r\nfrom alcoholic excess, nor to the many corruptions connected with the\r\nprivate drink trade, but simply and emphatically to the thing, itself.\r\nIt is, in fact, a religious tapu. I can respect it as such, and I can\r\nrespect the Samoan _tapus_ described by Stevenson, but it is necessary\r\nto recognise its nature, if we wish to understand its relation to what\r\nplain men mean by the temperance problem.\r\n\r\nIt may reasonably be deduced that the demand so constantly made that\r\ntemperance reformers of all schools should unite on a common programme\r\nis utterly impracticable. They cannot unite, because they do not want\r\nthe same things. There is no point of contact possible between those\r\nwho think beer so bad a thing that they are angry that anyone should be\r\nsupplied with it and those that think it so good a thing that they are\r\nangry that it should not be supplied in a pure state and under decent\r\nconditions; between those who object to the modern public house because\r\nthey think it at once evil and seductive and those who object to it\r\nbecause they think it demoralisingly ugly and uncomfortable. In short\r\nthere is no possible community of interest between those for whom the\r\nliquour problem is how to _supply_ alcoholic liquors with the greatest\r\nsocial profit and the least social damage and those for whom the\r\nproblem is how to prevent such liquours from being supplied at all.\r\n\r\n“The average man” says Mr. Edward R. Pease “wants beer.” This\r\nremarkable discovery is alone sufficient to place Mr. Pease at the\r\nhead of all our temperance reformers, for he is the only one of them\r\nwho seems to have realised its incontestable truth and importance. His\r\nadmirable book “The Case for Municipal Drink,”[9] which I strongly\r\nadvise all my readers interested in the question to obtain and study,\r\nis the most perfect presentation I know of the position of those who\r\nwish to know how best to supply drink, not how best not to supply\r\nit. Contrast it with the views constantly set forth in the _Daily\r\nNews_--views which may be taken to represent those espoused by at least\r\na large section of the Liberal Party--and you have something like a\r\nclear issue.\r\n\r\nNow if we could only get these two contradictory conceptions of\r\ntemperance reform clearly defined and separated, the drink question\r\nwould be a much easier thing to discuss than it is. Unfortunately\r\nthey have got almost indissolubly tangled by reason of the fact that\r\nso many who secretly hold the dogmatic teetotal view will not avow\r\nit frankly, while many others (practically the whole Liberal and\r\nProgressive parties for example) hastily adopt measures which have no\r\n_raison d’etre_ save in this view without thinking seriously about\r\ntheir nature. If the teetotal enthusiasts would say frankly (as some\r\nbut by no means all of them do) that they want absolute and unqualified\r\nProhibition and only support Local Veto and the much-vaunted Temperance\r\nPolicy of the London County Council as steps towards Prohibition--then\r\nat least we should know where we were. But when the _Daily News_ itself\r\nwas plainly and publicly challenged by the Rev. Stewart Headlam to\r\nsay whether it meant that or not, it pointedly evaded the question.\r\nThe fact is, of course that if this policy were frankly explained its\r\nsupporters would be snowed under at the next election even more finally\r\nthan the supporters of Local Veto were in 1895. So they do not avow it,\r\nbut try to get essentially prohibitionist legislation through under\r\ncover of vague phrases like “temperance reform” to which we are all\r\nurged to rally.\r\n\r\nTake Local Veto for example. What was the main proposal involved in\r\nSir William Harcourt’s famous measure. It proposed that every ward\r\n(the smallest area known to English local government) should have the\r\nright by a two-thirds majority to veto all licenses within its area or\r\nby a bare majority to reduce them by one fourth. Now was this measure\r\nintended to lead to Prohibition or was it not? If it was, then the\r\nEnglish people who did not want Prohibition did well to reject it;\r\nbut if it was not, and its supporters generally insist that it was\r\nnot, whither was it intended to lead. Its obvious effect in practice,\r\nas Mr. Pease has justly pointed out, would be that the rich districts,\r\nwhere public houses are few and cannot in any sense be regarded as a\r\nsocial evil, would probably expel them as derogatory to the interests\r\nof property and the “character of the neighbourhood,” while all the\r\ndrinking would be concentrated in the worst slum areas, where public\r\nhouses, not of the best type, are already dangerously numerous and\r\ncrowded, and where prohibition would have no chance whatever. This is\r\nclearly not a temperance reform in any sense of the word. It could\r\nhave been framed only in the interests of men who regard alcohol as so\r\npositively a devilish thing that they rejoice at the destruction of any\r\nplace defiled by its presence regardless of the ulterior consequences\r\nto temperance itself.\r\n\r\nThe Temperance Policy of the London County Council is at least as\r\nstrong a case in point. What is this much-trumpetted policy? It is\r\nthis; that when the County Council has to acquire the license of a\r\npublic house in the course of making some street improvement, it\r\nfirst pays huge compensation to the publican and then abandons the\r\nlicense, thus practically throwing the ratepayer’s money into the sea.\r\nThat is all. In the course of its distinguished career the L.C.C. has\r\nspent more than £300,000 in this wise and beneficent manner.\r\n\r\nNow what does the County Council suppose that it is doing? For a\r\nsystematic reduction of drink licenses in certain districts there is\r\ndoubtless much to be said, though I am inclined to think that the\r\nimportance of this as a factor in the temperance problem is grossly\r\nexaggerated. But, if that is to be effected, the whole licensing\r\nsystem must be brought under review and houses suppressed according\r\nto a well-considered plan. Care would for example be taken that the\r\nworse kind of houses were suppressed and the better retained. The\r\nCouncil suppresses them on no plan whatever--simply where it happens\r\nto be making a street improvement. The result is, of course, that\r\nthe gain to temperance is absolutely nil. A street is to be widened;\r\nthe public houses on one side of the street are pulled down, their\r\nlicenses purchased and abandoned; those on the other side remain. The\r\npeople who used to drink on the one side go over and drink on the\r\nother. The suppressed publican (or the brewer he represents) gets ample\r\ncompensation; the unsuppressed publican gets his neighbour’s trade in\r\naddition to his own without paying one farthing for it. And the public?\r\nWhat does the public get? The satisfaction of knowing that the workman\r\nmay have to cross the road in order to refresh himself.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the Progressive party, dangerously subject to\r\nintimidation by the Nonconformist chapels, has adopted a policy\r\nentirely meaningless from the standpoint of enlightened temperance,\r\nin obedience to the irrational demands of those who think that the\r\ndestruction of any public house must be a righteous act.\r\n\r\nNow the same spirit which revealed in the Local Veto Bill and still\r\nshows itself in the County Council policy has been to a great extent\r\nresponsible for the opposition encountered by the government’s\r\nLicensing Act. I do not say that this Act could not be fairly\r\ncriticised upon other grounds. The terms accorded to the Trade are\r\ncertainly high--in my view too high--and of the compensation granted\r\ntoo much seems likely (in the case of a tied house) to go to the\r\nbrewer and too little to the publican. But that is not the ground\r\nchosen by the most vehement enemies of the measure. The ground\r\nexplicitly chosen by them is that the publican is an enemy, a wicked\r\nman, whom we ought to punish for his misdeeds. If it were the case\r\nof any other trade, would anybody venture to deny that a man whose\r\nlivelihood is taken away by the arbitrary act of the governing powers\r\nthrough no fault of his own is entitled, whatever be his strict\r\nlegal position, to some measure of relief. To which the only answer\r\nvouchsafed by the teetotal faction consists in windy abuse of the\r\npublican as a “vampire.” I think that private monopoly in the Drink\r\nTrade is a great evil; so is private monopoly everywhere else. But\r\nto abuse the man who merely sells what the public demands and the\r\ncommunity instructs him to supply is fanaticism and not statesmanship.\r\n\r\nNow if, leaving this foolish cult, whose voting power is by no means\r\nin proportion to the noise it makes, we ask ourselves what kind of\r\ntemperance reform sensible reformers really want, we shall not find it\r\ndifficult to answer.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost then we want good liquour and especially good beer.\r\nEveryone who frequents public houses knows how hard this often is to\r\nobtain. Yet beer is our national drink, of which we ought to be proud.\r\nProperly manufactured it does no one any harm, though when made of\r\nchemical “substitutes” instead of sound malt and hops it is as noxious\r\nas any other adulterated concoction. Beer-drinking, within reasonable\r\nlimits, and provided the beer be sound liquour, is a national habit\r\nwhich no wise ruler would attempt to suppress. For it is the best\r\nprophylactic against the inordinate consumption of cheap and bad\r\nspirits which really is a national curse in Scotland and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSecondly we want decent surroundings. It is a most unfortunate thing\r\nthat few temperance reformers have any personal acquaintance with\r\npublic houses or with alcoholic drinking. For if they had they would\r\nknow that a man is much more likely to brutalise himself if he is\r\ncompelled to drink “perpendicularly” in a dirty, ugly, and gloomy bar\r\nthan if he can sit down comfortably, talk to his friends, play cards\r\nand listen, perhaps, to a little music. That is why another phase of\r\nthe L.C.C. “temperance” policy, the refusal of drink licenses to music\r\nhalls, is so manifestly absurd. A man who drinks at a music hall, where\r\nhe is being amused in other ways, is much less likely to get drunk than\r\none who drinks in a public house bar (as such bars are now conducted)\r\nwhere there is nothing to do but to go on drinking. As Mr. Headlam has\r\nexcellently expressed it, it would be a great deal better policy to\r\nturn every public house into a music hall than to turn every music\r\nhall into a teetotal institution. The second thing we want then is a\r\nhumanised public house.\r\n\r\nThirdly we want to get rid of the private commercial monopoly which\r\nexploits the drink trade, whereby vast fortunes are made at the expense\r\nof the community. These immense profits are the direct result of the\r\nmonopoly granted by the community to private traders in return for a\r\nnominal fee. To grant away what is practically public money in this\r\nway is monstrous. It is satisfactory to find that something like High\r\nLicense is foreshadowed in this year’s Licensing Act. But High License\r\nis not enough.\r\n\r\nThe sensible remedy is the municipalization of the liquour traffic\r\nwhich would fulfil all the above conditions. The municipal public\r\nhouse would refuse to sell any but the best liquors, and it would\r\nsupply these with humanising instead of demoralising surroundings. The\r\nprofits which the public are entitled to the public would receive.\r\nAnd let me say here that there is no reason whatever why we should\r\nwait for a municipal monopoly--which means waiting till Doomsday. The\r\nidea that municipal houses must not compete with privately owned ones\r\nrests ultimately upon the mischievous notion already examined that\r\nthe drinking of alcohol is in itself an evil thing upon which the\r\nstate ought to frown if it cannot actually suppress it. The typical\r\nBritish workman (whatever “democratic” politicians may say) does not\r\ngo into the public house in order to get drunk but in order to refresh\r\nhimself. If the municipality gives him better drink under more pleasant\r\nconditions than the publican he will frequent its houses without\r\ndemanding that drunkenness shall be either encouraged or connived at.\r\nAnd the competition of the municipal house will infallibly raise the\r\nstandard of those houses that remain in private hands.\r\n\r\nWhy does not the London County Council abandon its “Settled Temperance\r\nPolicy” and go as straight for municipal public houses as it has gone\r\nfor municipal trams? The common answer is that the Council has no power\r\nto run public houses; but this is no answer at all. Till this year it\r\nhad no power to run steamers on the Thames. But it wanted the power,\r\nit agitated for it, embodied it in its Bills and eventually forced a\r\nTory House of Commons to concede it. Has it ever asked for power to\r\nrun public houses? Not once. Moreover, even as things stand, it could\r\nif it pleased get to work on the right lines instead of on the wrong\r\nones. Instead of abandoning licenses it could retain them and lease the\r\nnew houses to publicans at pretty high ground rents and on stringent\r\nconditions such as would insure that the house should be of the best\r\ntype possible under private management. Besides there is Earl Grey’s\r\nTrust, an organisation founded expressly to anticipate most of the\r\nresults of municipalism. They could easily have let the Trust take over\r\nthe licenses, but they have persistently refused to do so. The fact is\r\nthat the London Progressives do not want to municipalise the retail\r\nliquour trade. They do not want to do it, because they dread the power\r\nof the Nonconformist chapel and the forces which find their political\r\nrallying ground in the local P.S.A., forces of which the guiding\r\nprinciple is not temperance, but a hatred of alcohol _per se_. But\r\nsurely it is possible to make a last appeal to the Progressive leaders.\r\nAfter all they have pricked that bubble once. To their eternal credit\r\nthey have defied and bitterly offended the chapels over the education\r\nquestion, and no very dire consequences have followed. Will they not\r\ntake their courage in their hands and defy them on the drink question\r\nalso?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“RETRENCHMENT AND REFORM.”\r\n\r\n\r\nWho could have believed five years ago that we should ever have heard\r\nagain, from any quarter more deserving of notice than the foolish and\r\nimpotent Cobden Club, the almost forgotten cry of “Peace, Retrenchment\r\nand Reform.” That it has become once more the rallying cry of the\r\nwhole Liberal party is significant, as nothing else could be, of the\r\nextent to which that party has moved backwards during the last decade\r\nor so. So far from the Liberal party having been “permeated” with\r\nSocialism since 1885, everything that has happened since then has\r\ntended to weaken the progressive collectivist element in its ranks and\r\nto strengthen the reactionary individualist element. We hear nothing\r\nnow of the well-meant if somewhat amateurish attempts at social\r\nreform which were popular with the followers of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain\r\ntwenty years ago,--nothing of “ransom” or of “three acres and a cow.”\r\nAs little do we hear or see of the Collectivist-Radical ideals of the\r\nearly nineties, of which the _Star_ and the old _Daily Chronicle_ were\r\nonce such vigorous exponents. Not only do the leaders of Liberalism\r\ncare for none of these things, but those who professed such enthusiasm\r\nfor them speak of them less and less. Mr. Massingham now-a-days appears\r\nto have eyes and ears for nothing but the diabolical wickedness of\r\nImperialism. Dr. Clifford, once the rising hope of collectivist\r\nDissent, is now too busy promoting sectarian anarchism to pay any\r\nperceptible attention to the “condition-of-the-people” question. It\r\nused at one time to be said that Mr. Gladstone’s stupendous authority\r\nmade it difficult for the party to become definitely Collectivist\r\nwhile he led it; but when he retired the new era was to begin. Well,\r\nMr. Gladstone is dead; but where is the new era? Mr. Gladstone’s\r\nplace has been taken by men who have inherited all his obsolete\r\nprejudices--only lacking his abilities; the “left wing” of the Liberal\r\nparty on which so many hopes were built is weaker and less disposed\r\nto a forward movement than ever. The consequence is that since 1895\r\nwe have seen nothing but Ghosts--ghosts of dead things which everyone\r\nthought to have been nicely nailed down and buried long ago. The South\r\nAfrican War raised the ghost of Gladstone with his anti-imperial bias\r\nand his narrow nationalist philosophy. Then the Education controversy\r\nbrought up the ghost of Miall with all the Dissidence of Dissent and\r\nall the Protestantism of the Protestant Religion. Lastly with the\r\nFiscal Question has come to light the yet older and mouldier ghost of\r\nCobden from whose shadowy lips issue the once famous formula--“Peace,\r\nRetrenchment and Reform.”\r\n\r\nSince this dilapidated Manchester sign-post has now become the\r\nmeeting point of all sections of the Liberal party, Radical and Whig,\r\nImperialist and Little Englander, and since some of the leaders of\r\nLabour and even (strange to say) some of the Socialists are taking up\r\ntheir places in the shadow, it becomes imperative to ask what meaning\r\nexactly the words are intended to convey. With “Peace” I have dealt\r\nfully already, and have endeavoured to define the Socialist attitude\r\ntowards it. But “Retrenchment and Reform” demand further examination.\r\n\r\nNo surer proof of the utter emptiness of what is called “Liberal\r\nImperialism” can be advanced than the manner in which its leaders have\r\njoined in the demand for retrenchment. I can understand the position\r\nof those who manfully opposed the South African War; I can understand\r\nthe position of those who manfully supported it. Both are honest and\r\nconsistent and worthy of all respect. But surely there never was a\r\nmeaner spectacle than this of eminent and influential politicians\r\nshouting vigorously with the Mafficking crowd while war is popular,\r\nand then, when the brief season of ultra-patriotic excitement is over,\r\ngrumbling and whining when presented with the inevitable bill of costs.\r\nIt is equally absurd and unworthy. If we want an Empire, if we want\r\na strong foreign policy, if we want vigour and efficiency--we must\r\nbe prepared to pay for it. If we think the price too high, then, in\r\nheaven’s name, let us be honest and admit that the Little Englanders\r\nwere in the right all along. Do not let us court an easy but most\r\ncontemptible popularity by swaggering as Imperialists, when what we\r\nreally want is all the sweets of Empire but none of the burdens. That\r\nis what “Liberal Imperialism” seems to mean. Indeed Liberal Imperialism\r\nhas proved nothing better than a fizzle. Three years ago we thought\r\nthat there might be something in it. So far-sighted a reformer as Mr.\r\nSidney Webb celebrated in a memorable magazine article “Lord Rosebery’s\r\nExodus from Houndsditch,” expressing the hope then widely entertained\r\nthat the Liberal Imperialist movement meant the final laying of\r\nGladstonian Ghosts and the creation of a Progressive party alive to\r\nthe needs of the new time. That hope is at an end. Lord Rosebery and\r\nhis retainers have re-entered Hounds ditch with triumphal pomp and\r\nceremony, and are now distinguishable from their frankly Gladstonian\r\ncolleagues only by the greater fluidity of their convictions.\r\n\r\nBut expenditure on offensive and defensive armaments, though a most\r\nnecessary item, is by no means the only item in our national accounts.\r\nWe spend a great deal of money on education; we ought to spend more. We\r\nspend a great deal of money on Home Office matters--factory inspectors\r\nand the like; again we ought to spend more. We want to spend money\r\nin a variety of other ways upon the improvement of the condition\r\nof the people. We want Old Age Pensions, we want free meals for\r\nschool-children, we want some sort of provision for the unemployed, we\r\nwant grants in aid of housing and other forms of local activity. How\r\nare we to get these things and yet retrench. Will not better education\r\ncost money? Will not more efficient factory inspection cost money?\r\nWill not Free Feeding cost money? Does not almost every kind of social\r\nreform mean increased expenditure? It is significant that the demand\r\nfor “retrenchment,” which is the Liberal cry in national affairs, is\r\nin local affairs the cry of the “Moderates,” that is of the magnates\r\nand monopolists who wish to exploit the public. But Liberal or Moderate\r\nit is always a reactionary cry. If we are to do our duty by the people,\r\nwe cannot retrench.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed why should we want to retrench--we I mean who profess\r\nourselves Socialists? Our complaint is not that too much of the\r\nnational revenue goes into the coffers of the state, but that too\r\nlittle finds its way thither. Too much of it goes to swell the incomes\r\nand maintain the status of a wealthy class of idle parasites. The more\r\nwe can get hold of and use for public purposes the better. And the more\r\nwe pile on taxation (always supposing we pile it on in the right place)\r\nthe nearer we approach to the Socialist ideal. Retrenchment of public\r\nexpenditure and the reduction of taxation to a minimum is essentially\r\nan individualist policy. The socialist policy is to pool the rents and\r\nprofits of industry and devote the revenue so obtained to useful public\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nBut, if retrenchment is an inadmissible policy for Socialists, what\r\nabout reform? I can only say that I wish all such words as “reform,”\r\n“progress,” “advanced” etc. were at the bottom of the sea. They are\r\nmischievous because they lend colour to the vague idea which exists in\r\nthe minds of so many “moderns” that if we keep on moving fast enough\r\nwe are sure to be all right. It never seems to occur to people that\r\nsomething depends on the direction. What I want to know about a man\r\nis not whether he is “progressive” or “advanced” or “modern” or “a\r\nreformer,” but whether he wants to do the same things that I want\r\nto do. If he wants to do the exact opposite the less “advanced” and\r\n“progressive” he is the better. When therefore amiably muddy-minded\r\npeople talk about “Reform” all we have to ask them is, “What reform?”\r\nWhat did Cobden and Gladstone mean by “reform?” What do the present-day\r\nLiberals and Radicals mean by it? One thing is certain; neither has\r\never meant social reform--the only kind that seems to me to matter; or,\r\nif the thought of social questions ever crossed their minds at all,\r\nat least neither has ever meant collectivist social reform--the only\r\nkind that in my view can ever be effective. What the Liberals meant and\r\nmean, so far as they now mean anything at all, was and is political\r\nreform and political reform along certain defined lines.\r\n\r\nThe old Radical programme of political change is worn so threadbare\r\nthat it is hardly worth discussing at this time of day. As however,\r\nin the general resurrection of Gladstonian Ghosts, which we are now\r\nwitnessing, a very attenuated spectre of the Old Radical-Republican\r\npropaganda of the ’sixties seems disposed to put in an appearance, it\r\nmay be worth while to say a word or two about it.\r\n\r\nAs to Republicanism itself it hardly demands attention in the twentieth\r\ncentury. No-one except Mr. John M. Robertson even professes to think\r\nit important. The S.D.F., it is true, still puts the abolition of\r\nmonarchy in its programme of palliatives, but that I imagine is merely\r\na comparatively harmless concession to revolutionary tradition.\r\nDoubtless hereditary monarchy is theoretically illogical; but the\r\ntime has gone by when men deduced perfect theories of government _a\r\npriori_ from the Social Contract or the Natural Rights of Man. What we\r\nnow ask concerning an institution is--does it obstruct the execution\r\nof necessary reforms? Now no one can seriously maintain that the\r\nBritish Monarchy obstructs anything. The power of the Crown, such\r\nas it is, has, since the accession of the present Sovereign at any\r\nrate, been used almost entirely in the interests of genuine progress.\r\nHereditary monarchy supplies us on the whole with a very convenient\r\nmethod of obtaining a representative of the nation who shall not, like\r\na President, be the nominee of a political party. A great deal of\r\nnational veneration and sentiment has grown up round the Throne, and\r\nit would be foolish to waste time in attacking an immensely popular\r\ninstitution which does no harm and has its decided advantages.\r\n\r\nThe old outcry against Royal Grants so dear to the heart of Mr. Henry\r\nLabouchere may be similarly dismissed. It was never likely to be\r\npopular with a people averse above all things to the suspicion of\r\nmeanness; and it has now become hopelessly obsolete, partly because\r\nof the general collapse of republican sentiment, and partly because\r\npeople have begun to realise that it is a little ridiculous to get\r\nviolently excited because the King is given a few thousands in return\r\nfor certain services, some of which are decidedly important and all\r\nof which the nation really desires him to perform, while we allow\r\nlandlords, capitalists and financiers to pocket many hundred times as\r\nmuch in return for no services whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe question of the House of Lords appears at first sight a more\r\nserious one. But, when examined closely its importance is seen to be\r\nmuch exaggerated. In order to make out a case strong enough to induce\r\nus to turn aside from our more urgent tasks and spend weary years in\r\nagitating for the disestablishment of the Upper House, Radicals must\r\nshow that the Lords are in the habit of rejecting measures of great\r\nintrinsic importance to the people at large and really demanded by\r\nthem. Can they show this? I think not. The only measure of importance\r\nwhich the Lords have rejected during the last thirty years has been\r\nthe Home Rule Bill, and a subsequent appeal to the people proved\r\nconclusively that the Lords were right in so rejecting it--that the\r\npeople of Great Britain were not as a whole really in favour of it, in\r\nfact that there was no such effective demand as there ought clearly to\r\nbe before so great a change is made in the constitution of the realm.\r\nEven if the Radicals had the solid democracy at their back (as they\r\ncertainly have not and are not in the least likely to have) it would\r\nstill take some ten years to disestablish the Lords. On the other hand,\r\nif we have the democracy at our back in support of any particular\r\nreform that we want, it will not take much more than ten weeks to\r\nintimidate or circumvent them. The Lords are too acute and too careful\r\nof their own interests to resist for any length of time measures upon\r\nwhich Englishmen have once made up their minds firmly. As a matter of\r\nfact the objection to the House of Lords is not a reformer’s objection\r\nbut a Liberal partizan’s objection. The existence of the Second\r\nChamber, as at present constituted, undoubtedly hampers the Liberal\r\nparty in its competition with the Tories, because the Tories can get\r\nmore drastic measures of reform through the Upper House than they can.\r\nBut with us to whom it is a matter of supreme indifference by which\r\nparty reforms are carried this consideration need not weigh.\r\n\r\nIt cannot of course be denied that the present constitution of the\r\nUpper House is a flagrant anachronism. The structure of our society\r\nis no longer feudal, and government by a hereditary territorial\r\naristocracy is therefore out of date. Moreover there are practical\r\ndisadvantages in the present system, since, though the Lords do not\r\nreject anything which the people really want, they do sometimes\r\nmutilate valuable measures in the interest of property owners. If\r\ntherefore it be found possible without wasting too much valuable\r\nenergy to introduce new elements into the composition of the Second\r\nChamber, one would not refuse to consider the idea. This is in fact\r\nalmost certain, to be done some day--probably by the Tories anxious to\r\nstrengthen the Upper House. The inclusion of elected representatives\r\nfrom the Colonies might be a very good way to begin.\r\n\r\nWith the Disestablishment of the Church the case is rather different.\r\nThe abolition of hereditary aristocracy, though difficult and\r\nnot particularly urgent, might be a good thing in itself. Church\r\nDisestablishment on the other hand would, I am convinced, be not only a\r\nwaste of time and energy, but a most undesirable and retrograde step.\r\nSurely it is not for us Socialists to agitate for the desocialisation\r\nof national religion and for the transfer of what is now in effect\r\nnational property to private and irresponsible hands. Moreover the\r\ndenationalisation of the Church would be from a tactical point of\r\nview a most fatal step. I say this without reference to the question\r\n(upon which Socialists will hold all sorts of divergent opinions) of\r\nthe truth of the doctrines of the Church of England or indeed of any\r\nform of Christianity or Theism. It has been often pointed out that\r\nthe Church has shown itself more easily permeable by the Socialist\r\nmovement than have any of the Dissenting bodies. Many reasons have\r\nbeen suggested to account for this, and no doubt there is an element\r\nof truth in all of them. Without doubt the Catholic and Sacramental\r\nsystem of theology blends more easily with Socialism than the\r\nEvangelical theology does. It is also unquestionably true that the\r\nfeudal traditions which still linger in the English Church are more\r\nakin to the ideas of Socialism than are the Liberal and Individualist\r\ntraditions of Dissent. But one of the most important causes of the\r\nmore sympathetic attitude of the clergy of the Established Church\r\nis surely this, that the Church, being established and endowed, is\r\nresponsible to the people and to the people alone, while the “Free”\r\nChurches are bound hand and foot to the wealthy deacons and elders on\r\nwhose subscription they are forced to rely. Disestablish the Church\r\nand the rich subscriber will rule her with a rod of iron. Democratic\r\npriests will be hampered and harassed as democratic ministers are now.\r\nThis, it seems to me, is not a result to which (whatever our religious\r\nviews) we can look forward without anxiety. Whether “priestcraft” be\r\na good or a bad force, it is without doubt an extremely powerful one;\r\nand it is clearly the business of Socialists, whether Christian or\r\nSecularist, to see that, so far as is possible, it shall be exercised\r\non their side. The sound Socialist policy is not to disestablish the\r\nChurch of England, but to establish concurrently all religious bodies\r\nof sufficient magnitude and importance to count. Had this been done\r\nin Ireland thirty years ago, as Matthew Arnold recommended, had we,\r\ninstead of disestablishing the Anglican Church there, established and\r\nendowed the Roman Catholic Church along side of her, how much less\r\nserious might our difficulties in that country have been!\r\n\r\nAs to the elective franchise and kindred questions they can hardly be\r\nregarded as any longer pressing. It would be a good thing, I do not\r\ndeny, if our conditions of registration were simplified, but that is\r\nnot a question upon which the people feel or can be expected to feel\r\nvery keenly. No class is now intentionally disfranchised,--it is only a\r\nmatter of individuals. In other words, though there are anomalies and\r\ninconveniences in our electoral system, there is no longer any specific\r\ngrievance. Women might perhaps have a grievance if any large number\r\nof them demanded the right to vote, but until this is so politicians\r\ncannot be expected to pay much attention to the matter. There is\r\na stronger case for redistribution, but this (owing to the gross\r\nover-representation of Ireland) is generally regarded as a Conservative\r\nrather than a Liberal measure.\r\n\r\nThe only political reform that seems at all worth fighting for is\r\nthe payment of members. This is really desirable and important, and\r\nshould be pushed to the front when political questions are under\r\ndiscussion. For not only would it open Parliament more freely to the\r\nrepresentatives of the workers, but it would also make the position\r\nof an M.P., a more responsible one. A paid representative, it may\r\nreasonably be supposed, would take his profession more seriously,\r\nand would at the same time be looked after more sharply by his\r\nconstituents. We have on the whole quite enough gentlemanly and\r\nwell-meaning amateurs in politics to whom legislation is a harmless\r\nhobby, and who are readily enough outwitted and captured by the keen\r\nand energetic representatives of finance who do take their business\r\nseriously and mean to win. Therefore if we are to have any political\r\nchanges at all let us go straight for payment of members.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOCIAL RECONSTRUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn previous chapters I have generally begun by criticising the Liberal\r\npolicy in relation to the matter to be discussed. It would seem natural\r\nin this chapter to deal with the Liberal policy in relation to social\r\nreform. But in that case the essay would be an exceedingly short one.\r\nThere is no Liberal policy in relation to social reform.\r\n\r\nThe nearest thing to a least common denominator which I can find after\r\nsearching diligently the speeches of the Liberal leaders and their\r\nbackers is that most of them are in favour of doing something to\r\nthe “land monopoly.” Exactly what they propose to do to it I cannot\r\nquite discover. “Overthrowing the land monopoly” may mean Leasehold\r\nEnfranchisement; it may mean the Taxation of Land Values; it may\r\nmean Small Holdings, Free Sale or the Nationalisation of Land. The\r\nlast suggestion may be dismissed; we are certainly no more likely to\r\nget that from the Liberals than from the Tories. Small Holdings are\r\nexcellent things, but the principle has been conceded, and we are as\r\nlikely to get a further extension of it from the Tories as from the\r\nLiberals, in any case this policy does not touch the essence of the\r\nsocial question. Leasehold Enfranchisement, Free Sale, etc., are sham\r\nreforms of middle-class origin of which we now hear little. There\r\nremains the Taxation of Land Values.\r\n\r\nThe Taxation of Land Values is very popular with the Liberals just\r\nnow. Whether it would be equally popular with them were they in office\r\nis perhaps a matter for legitimate speculation. It will be remembered\r\nthat it was part of their programme in 1892, and is to this day faintly\r\ndiscernable on the newly cleaned slate of the party. As however it is\r\nre-emerging into prominence it maybe well to say something in reference\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nA good deal of confusion is inevitable concerning this particular\r\nproposal, arising from the fact that it may be regarded in two entirely\r\ndifferent lights. It may be considered simply as one way among many\r\nothers of raising revenue to meet necessary public expenditure, or it\r\nmay be regarded as a practical application of the economic doctrines\r\nassociated with the name of Henry George, who taught that all revenue\r\nshould be raised by a single tax (or more properly rent) on the site\r\nvalue of land. Now Georgian economics have made practically no headway\r\nin this country; their _a priori_ logic, their reliance on abstract\r\nassumptions rather than on history and practical experiment, their\r\nrigidity and inflexibility of application, are exasperating to a people\r\nnaturally impatient of metaphysics but keenly alive to immediate\r\nsocial needs. People who begin their economic speculations, as the\r\nGeorgites generally do, by discussing what are the natural rights of\r\nman and deducing from this an ideally perfect system of taxation and\r\ngovernment put themselves out of court with practical men. There are\r\nno natural rights of man; there is no abstractly perfect economic\r\nor political system; we are painfully struggling by means of many\r\nexperiments and many failures towards something like a decently\r\nworkable one.\r\n\r\nBut, though Georgism is a horse so dead that to flog it would be\r\nprofitless malignity, the taxation of land values, conceived not as\r\nthe _only_ means of raising revenue, but as an _additional_ means of\r\ndoing so, is very much in favour both with some of the leaders and\r\nwith the whole rank and file of the Opposition. Nor is the reason far\r\nto seek. The misery and waste produced by our present social system\r\nare so patent and terrible that a vague feeling that “something must\r\nbe done” has been spreading rapidly through all classes, and even\r\nLiberals have caught the infection. Most drastic reforms however\r\nare impossible for them because such reforms would clash with the\r\ninterests of the capitalists and traders who form the backbone of the\r\nparty. To them therefore the proposal to tax land values comes as a\r\nspecial interposition of Providence to succour them in their need.\r\nIt professes to do something for the poor,--exactly what they might\r\nfind some difficulty in saying. But a certain amount of ill-digested\r\nGeorgism can be exploited in support of their case, while at the same\r\ntime a loud and definite appeal can be made to the Liberal capitalists\r\nand the Liberal bourgeoise to share in the plunder of the land-owners.\r\nUnfortunately the cock will not fight. The working classes, not\r\nbelieving in Georgian economics, are, because of the hardness of\r\ntheir hearts, supremely indifferent to the taxation of land values.\r\nNeither the ingenuity of eccentric economists nor the eloquence of\r\nLiberal capitalists can induce them to take the slightest interest in\r\nthe subject. No Trades Union Congress can be persuaded to take it up;\r\nno Labour candidate will make it a prominent plank in his platform.\r\nThe workers may not be expert economists, but they are not quite so\r\neasily deluded as the Liberals suppose. They have a very shrewd eye to\r\ntheir own interests, and are quite acute enough to know that it is the\r\ncapitalist and not the landlord who is the most active and dangerous\r\nenemy of the labourer, and to perceive that the talk about “the land\r\nmonopoly” is merely a clever if somewhat transparent dodge on the part\r\nof the former to divert public indignation from himself to his sleeping\r\npartner in exploitation.\r\n\r\nI am for getting the last farthing of unearned increment wherever\r\nit can be got. But I can see no earthly reason for taxing unearned\r\nincrement from land more than any other kind. What we really want is\r\na heavily graduated income tax with a discrimination against unearned\r\nincomes. This would hit the landlord and the capitalist equally hard,\r\nand is therefore not likely to find favour with the Liberal party.\r\n\r\nBut even if the taxation of land values were as perfect a method of\r\nraising revenue for public purposes as its advocates assert, it would\r\nstill be necessary to insist that no alteration in the incidence of\r\ntaxation will ever solve the problem of poverty. Suppose that you have\r\ngot every penny of unearned increment into the public treasury, the\r\nquestion then arises--What are you going to do with it? If you keep\r\nit locked up in a box, the last state of the people will be worse\r\nthan the first. If it is to be of benefit to anybody this revenue\r\nmust be used by the State as industrial capital. That is to say the\r\nsocialisation of industry must go hand in hand with the reform of\r\ntaxation.\r\n\r\nNow what the Labour party really wants just now is two or three genuine\r\ninstallments of Socialism on which to concentrate its energies. A party\r\nwithout a programme is always an absurdity; a labour party without\r\na programme is an absurdity passing the just limits of farce. It is\r\nfutile to think that you can keep a party together much less build up a\r\nnew one, with no common basis save the desire to amend trade union law,\r\nwhich appears to be the only demand on which the L.R.C. is united at\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAnd the programme of the Labour party must, for reasons already cited,\r\nbe a Socialist and not a Liberal programme. I do not mean that the\r\nwhole party should call itself Socialist or should be committed\r\nto Socialism as that term is understood by the S.D.F. We have been\r\nsurfeited in the past with abstract resolutions in favour of “the\r\nsocialisation of all the means of production, distribution and\r\nexchange.” But I do maintain that the programme must be collectivist in\r\ntendency and must have the organisation of industry by the state and\r\nthe abolition of industrial parasitism as its ultimate goal. Also it\r\nmust as far as possible appeal directly to the interests of the people\r\nfor with all his great qualities the British workman is constitutionary\r\ndefective in the capacity for seeing far before his nose, and will not\r\nreadily grow enthusiastic about the soundest economic measure which\r\ndoes not obviously improve the position of his class. At the same\r\ntime the labour party would do well to avoid too much narrowness of\r\noutlook, since there are, as we shall see, some measures which do not\r\nappear at first sight to benefit the worker directly, but which are\r\nindispensable conditions of his ultimate emancipation. Such measures\r\nshould therefore be put along side of the more patently beneficial one\r\nand their connection with these as far as possible made plain to the\r\nelectorate.\r\n\r\nThe greatest strides which applied Socialism has made during the last\r\ntwenty years have been made in connection with the municipalities. The\r\nbest proof that can be given of the immense and salutary growth of\r\nmunicipal activity in recent years is to be found in the angry panic\r\nwhich this growth has produced among the financial exploiters of public\r\nneeds. The latter, having at their back boundless wealth and influence,\r\na powerful and lavishly endowed organisation, a vast army of lecturers\r\nand pamphleteers, and the greatest and most weighty of British\r\nnewspapers, opened a year or so ago a fierce campaign against what\r\nthey called “Municipal Socialism.” Never did so potent an army suffer\r\nso humiliating a reverse. On the progress of municipal trading the\r\nattack made no impression whatsoever. The public at large saw through\r\nthe game and gave the public-spirited authorities their generous and\r\nenergetic support. The municipal movement has received no check; it\r\nhas gone on more triumphantly than ever. Energetic local bodies have\r\npushed their activities further and taken the satisfaction of public\r\nneeds more and more out of the hands of private speculators, vesting\r\nit in those of responsible public officials. But the opponents of\r\nmunicipalism are still active, clever and unscrupulous; and we cannot\r\nafford to leave the public interest at any disadvantage in dealing with\r\nthem. It is unquestionably at such a disadvantage at present, partly\r\non account of the inconveniently restricted boundaries of local areas,\r\npartly because of the anti-progressive bias of the Local Government\r\nBoard, and partly because of the state of the law in regard to the\r\npowers of local authorities. The first point has been discussed so\r\nexcellently by Mr. H. G. Wells and others that I need do no more than\r\nallude to it here; with the second I shall deal later. But the third is\r\nof special importance.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of the law a private individual or a collection of\r\nprivate individuals may do anything which the law does not expressly\r\nforbid; but a municipality or local body of any kind may only do\r\nwhat the law expressly permits. Thus for instance the London County\r\nCouncil has by law the power to run trams, but when it attempted to\r\nrun an omnibus line to and from its tram terminus, the private omnibus\r\ncompanies successfully invoked the law against it. This is absurd;\r\nit is intolerable that a public authority should not be permitted\r\nto supply what its constituents definitely demand without going to\r\na largely indifferent and largely hostile parliament for permission\r\nto do so. Broadly speaking County and Borough Councils at any rate\r\nshould have power to do anything that the nation through the national\r\nlegislature does not definitely prohibit. It would be well for the\r\nLabour party in Parliament to demand a free hand for progressive\r\nmunicipalities such as can only be secured by legislation on these\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nThe Housing Question connects itself closely with this matter, for its\r\nonly possible solution will be found to be along the lines of municipal\r\nactivity. But, in addition to a free hand for municipalities to build\r\nhouses when and where they like, it would be well to consider whether\r\nin the face of the present house famine it is wise to raise our local\r\nrevenues by what is in effect a heavy tax on houses. The payment of say\r\nhalf the rates on well-built and sanitary working-class dwellings out\r\nof the proceeds of government grants would give a much needed impetus\r\nto both municipal and private enterprise in this direction.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Labour men on municipal bodies should make the fullest\r\nuse of such powers as they already possess and push forward vigorously\r\nwith their campaign of municipal socialism in such a manner that the\r\nworkman may perceive its direct benefits. His Housing should be visibly\r\ncheaper and better, his trams visibly quicker, less expensive and more\r\ncomfortable, his gas and water supply visibly improved on account\r\nof their transfer to a public body. At the same time of course the\r\nlabour employed by the municipality in conducting these industries\r\nshould receive what we may call (to borrow a phrase from diplomacy)\r\n“most favoured employé” treatment. It may be remarked that it is not\r\ndesirable that municipal undertakings should aim at large profits.\r\nTheoretically this is indefensible for it means that the consumer pays\r\nmore than his fair share of the rates; practically it is undesirable,\r\nsince it tends to obscure the real benefits of municipal enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn national affairs the progress of definite socialism cannot\r\nperhaps be so rapid. But the Labour party might well press for the\r\nnationalisation of mines, especially of coal fields (already demanded\r\nby the Trade Union Congress), the state regulation and ultimate\r\nnationalisation of railways, canals and other means of transit, and\r\nshould insist on government departments doing their own work wherever\r\npossible and paying not less than the standard rate of wages.[10]\r\n\r\nBut legislation of this kind has only an indirect effect upon the\r\nreal problem that confronts the people of this country,--the people\r\nof all countries which have developed along the lines of industrial\r\ncivilisation. With the appalling evidences of physical degeneration\r\nconfronting us, we cannot, whether we are Socialists or Labourites or\r\nonly decently humane and patriotic Englishmen, do without a social\r\npolicy. In the last resort, all progress, all empire, all efficiency\r\ndepends upon the kind of race we breed. If we are breeding the people\r\nbadly neither the most perfect constitution nor the most skilful\r\ndiplomacy will save us from shipwreck.\r\n\r\nWhat are we to do with the great masses of unskilled, unorganised\r\nlabour in our big towns? That is the question which intelligent\r\nthinkers are now asking themselves; and, as Carlyle said “England\r\nwill answer it, or on the whole England will perish.” We have drained\r\nour country side and destroyed our agriculture to a great extent\r\ndeliberately in order to obtain this vast city proletariat. Its\r\ncondition is appalling; it is starved at school, over-worked when it\r\nis just growing into manhood, and afterwards drifts into the ghastly\r\nback-waters of our towns, now sweated, now unemployed, always an open\r\nsore, a contamination, a menace to our national life. That is what\r\nfifty years of applied Liberalism have made of about a third of the\r\nEnglish people.\r\n\r\nWell, the first thing we must do is to try to save the next generation\r\nif we cannot save this one. The child at any rate must be protected.\r\nOne of the first and most urgent of the social reforms needed is the\r\nfeeding of children in public elementary schools. To teach unfed\r\nor underfed children is a sheer piece of profitless brutality.\r\nCompulsory and free feeding is as necessary to us as compulsory and\r\nfree teaching--more necessary in fact for more could in the long run\r\nbe made of an ignorant people that was fit and healthy physically\r\nthan of a race of white-faced cripples, whom society had crammed with\r\nbook-learning to satisfy its theories as barbarously as it crams geese\r\nwith food to satisfy its palate. We are entitled therefore to demand\r\nthe free feeding of all children attending Public Elementary Schools.\r\nOf course all sorts of less drastic proposals will be made--proposals\r\nfor feeding destitute children only, or for making a charge, or for\r\nrecovering the cost of the meals from the parents. Some of these\r\nproposals will be better than others, and we must take the best we can\r\nget. But none of them will solve the problem. Nor will the problem be\r\nsolved by any merely permissive legislation, giving local authorities\r\nthe _power_ to feed children without compelling them to use it. A local\r\nauthority has no more right to underfeed its children than a parent\r\nhas. All local authorities must be held responsible for the proper\r\nfeeding of school children with their areas of administration, as they\r\nare already held responsible for their proper instruction.\r\n\r\nAt the same time another policy might be adopted the results of which\r\nwould indirectly be of perhaps still greater value. I suggest that\r\nwhile these experiments are proceeding there should be a periodical\r\nphysical examination of all the children in the elementary schools\r\nby duly authorised medical officers. This would be a good test of\r\nthe success of the new feeding policy and might form the basis for\r\nan extension of the principle of grants in aid to encourage those\r\nmunicipalities which were most zealous in looking after the physical\r\nwell-being of the children. But its usefulness would not end there; it\r\nwould provide us with what we most want a really reliable collection of\r\nsociological data upon which future reforms could be based.\r\n\r\nBut when the child leaves school the need of protection by no means\r\nceases. Our factory code already recognises that the setting of\r\nchildren to hard commercial work before their minds and bodies have had\r\ntime to develop is as wasteful (from a national point of view) as it is\r\ninhuman. But the application of the principle is still half-hearted.\r\nChildren over eleven can in some parts of the Kingdom be employed in\r\nfactories provided that they put in one school attendance per day; the\r\nage at which even this provision ceases to operate is fourteen, after\r\nwhich the children are held to become “young persons,” and may work\r\nsixty hours or more per week. This is clearly very little security\r\nfor the physical and moral development of the race. No child should,\r\nunder any circumstances whatever, be allowed to work for wages until\r\nhe or she is--say fourteen. From fourteen to twenty the “half-time”\r\narrangement might be made to apply, and, as has already been\r\nsuggested, we could use the time so gained in order to give the young\r\npeople effective technical, and, in their latter years, also military\r\ntraining, thereby immensely improving their physique and at the same\r\ntime forming a national reserve of almost invincible strength.\r\n\r\nBut after all most social problems come back in the end to the wages\r\nproblem. If the workers received better wages many of the questions\r\nwhich now perplex us would solve themselves. And here we are brought\r\ndirectly to what Mr. Sidney Webb has called “the policy of the National\r\nMinimum.” The principle of the national minimum has been long ago\r\nembodied in legislation, and is in reality the root idea of factory\r\nacts, public health acts, restrictions on over-crowding and most other\r\nsocial reforms of the last century. But its possibilities are by no\r\nmeans exhausted. We must develop it further along the same lines until\r\nit gives us what we most want, a statutary minimum wage for labour.\r\nThis has been partially established in a few of the most prosperous of\r\nour staple industries by the development of Trade Unionism. Its much\r\nneeded application to the unskilled trades where the rankest sweating\r\nabounds can only be made possible by the exertion of state authority.\r\nTo those who are soaked in the Liberal tradition of “free contract” of\r\ncourse the legal minimum wage will seem a piece of odious tyranny, but\r\nthere is, as it seems to me, no essential difference between the fixing\r\nof maximum hours by law and the fixing of minimum wages. It is at least\r\nas important to the community that its citizens should not be underpaid\r\nas that they should not be overworked.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Unions to which we owe nearly all that betterment of the\r\ncondition of the workers which Liberals absurdly attribute to Free\r\nTrade, cannot possibly be allowed to remain in the impossible position\r\nin which recent legal decisions have placed them. But that is no\r\nreason for agitating for what is called the _status quo ante_, which\r\nis neither practicable nor desirable. The sound demand is that the\r\nlaw should be made clear; that it should put single employés and\r\ncombinations of workmen on an equal footing; that legal disabilities of\r\nTrade Unions should be removed; and that the liability of Trade Unions\r\nshould be definitely confined to those authorised acts of its servants\r\nor agents for which a corporate body may fairly be held responsible.\r\nThis on the face of it is reasonable, and should be applicable to\r\nemployers’ associations also, so that when the time comes for the\r\nenactment of a Compulsory Arbitration Law (as in Australia)--that is\r\nwhen the trade unionists themselves recognise the desirability of such\r\na measure, the machinery for its execution will be available.\r\n\r\nThen there is the perennial and apparently impenetrable problem of the\r\nUnemployed. This is one of the problems which in all probability cannot\r\nbe finally solved except by a complete reorganization of society. But,\r\nwisely handled, it can be palliated and reduced to more manageable\r\nproportions. In discussing this question a distinction must always\r\nbe made between the temporary unemployment to which all workmen are\r\nliable, and the permanent or chronic unemployment of the great masses\r\nof the unfit which our social system is always throwing off. These poor\r\nwretches are no more to be blamed for their idleness and worthlessness\r\n(from the social standpoint) than the rich shareholder is to be blamed\r\nfor his. But their presence unquestionably complicates the problem and\r\ntheir treatment must inevitably be different. The first thing to do is\r\nto get at the facts. For this purpose there should be a Labour Bureau\r\nin connection with every considerable local authority which should\r\nkeep a record of the state of the labour market from time to time.\r\nThese bureaus should be in constant communication with a Department\r\nof Labour at Westminster, which is one of the most pressing needs of\r\nthe hour. As to relief works, Mr. Long’s farm colonies are good so\r\nfar as they go; schemes for re-afforestation and the reclamation of\r\nfore-shores are perhaps even better. But it is well to keep in mind\r\nthat the great aim of all social reformers should be to eliminate the\r\n“unemployable” class altogether. Mr. Webb’s “national minimum” policy\r\nif carried out in all its branches would practically do this.\r\n\r\nThe question of employment is closely connected with the whole question\r\nof our Poor Law, which badly wants re-modelling. Such a process should\r\ninclude the abolition of the Poor Law Guardians (the last relic of the\r\n_ad hoc_ principle and a far more indefensible one than the School\r\nBoards) and the transfer of their powers to the local authority best\r\nfitted to deal with them,--probably the County and Borough Councils. It\r\nshould also of course include the establishment of universal Old Age\r\nPensions, a measure whose popularity is as manifest as its justice, as\r\nwas proved in 1895, when it contributed enormously to swell the Tory\r\nmajority. The fact is that our present Poor Law was the first product\r\nof middle class Liberalism, flushed with its stupendous victory of\r\n1832. It is founded unmistakeably on the principles of that creed,\r\nwhich, believing in the eternal justice of “economic harmonies,”\r\nregarded the fact of a poor man being out of work as convincing proof\r\nof his worthlessness and criminality. It is as impossible for us, as\r\nthe old Poor Law was for them.\r\n\r\nLess obvious but not less certain is the connection between all these\r\nproblems and the decline of our agriculture. It is the decline of\r\nagriculture which has driven into the towns the masses of unskilled\r\nlabour with which we have to deal. Indeed the Liberals foresaw and\r\ndeliberately planned this, when, first by the Poor Law and afterwards\r\nby the Repeal of the Corn Laws, they drove labour off the land in\r\norder to obtain it cheaply in the great industrial centres. And that\r\nis how the situation has worked out, so that it is important, no less\r\nin the interest of the town proletariat than in that of the country,\r\nthat we should re-organise the first and most necessary of our staple\r\nindustries. The idea apparently entertained in some Liberal circles\r\nthat this can be done by the taxation of land values is, as Mr.\r\nBrougham Villiers has pointed out in “The Opportunity of Liberalism”\r\n(not altogether I should suppose to the gratification of his Liberal\r\nfriends), on the face of it absurd. The end at which we are aiming is\r\nnot that the state should own the ground rents but that it should own\r\nthe land and the capital used to develop it, and it is towards this end\r\nthat our policy should be directed. To this end we want an energetic\r\nsystem of state aid to farmers such as that already inaugurated by\r\nSir Horace Plunkett and others in Ireland. We want loans to farmers\r\non state security and experiments in cooperative farming under state\r\nsupervision and with state encouragement; we want increased powers for\r\nlocal authorities in rural districts to buy and develop land; above\r\nall we want light railways, cheap and rapid transit, an agricultural\r\nparcels post (as proposed by Mr. Rider Haggard); and finally we want an\r\nend put to the monstrous system whereby Railway Companies charge higher\r\nrates to British than to foreign producers. When this policy has been\r\nfairly tried we shall see whether we also want a protective tariff.\r\nWe do not want a tariff which will merely raise the landlord’s rent,\r\nbut, as I have already pointed out, Socialists have no theoretic bias\r\nagainst such a tariff if it can be shown to be necessary to the public\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nBut there is one question to which Socialists ought to devote a great\r\ndeal more attention than they show any signs of devoting at present.\r\nLord Randolph Churchill, the ablest and most far-sighted of modern\r\nparty leaders, saw its importance twenty years ago, and put it in the\r\nfore-front of his programme. That question is the reform of government\r\ndepartments. Until this is honestly faced and dealt with, the\r\nIndividualist will always have a powerful controversial weapon against\r\nSocialist propaganda. When the Socialist demands that the state shall\r\nundertake more duties, his opponent has only to point to the duties it\r\nhas already undertaken and ask if he wants any more duties performed\r\nlike that! A national system of transit run as the War Office is run\r\nwould hardly be an unqualified blessing and would probably produce\r\na reaction of the most damaging kind. The only answer is to reform\r\nthe government departments and make them workmanlike and efficient\r\nbodies. Until this is done we shall be checked at every point every\r\ntime we want a measure involving state ownership carried. Moreover\r\nwe shall find it impossible to give effect to our policy of state\r\nregulation. The War Office has on the whole been most unfairly treated\r\nin being gibbetted as the supreme type of red tape and inefficiency.\r\nIn neither respect is it really worse than most other branches of our\r\nadministration--not so bad for example as the Local Government Board,\r\nwhich is so hopelessly understaffed and so miserably ineffective that\r\nit is obliged from mere instinct of self-preservation to oppose every\r\nforward movement in municipal politics lest it should be overburdened\r\nstill further. It matters little who is its representative in the\r\nCabinet. It is the Board itself and not its President for the time\r\nbeing that obstructs progress. Yet an efficient Local Government Board,\r\nencouraging progressive local bodies and harrying up backward ones, is\r\nan essential part of the “national minimum” policy. From every point\r\nof view therefore it is essential that our departments of state should\r\nbe put on a new and better footing. A businesslike Home Office and a\r\nbusinesslike Local Government Board would do more for social reform\r\nthan many acts of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME MATERIALS AND A POSSIBILITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuccessive Reform Acts have so widened the basis of the franchise\r\nin this country that the working man has now the issue of the great\r\nmajority of elections in his hands. By the working man I here mean\r\nthe manual labourer who earns weekly wages; the definition is not\r\nscientific, but it is I think effectively descriptive. It is difficult\r\nto define a working man, but people know him when they see him, as\r\nMr. Morley said of a Jingo. The manual labourer then is master of the\r\nsituation; and it becomes a matter of primary importance for any party\r\nwhich wishes for a parliamentary majority to consider what manner of\r\nman he is, and what kind of policy is likely to receive his favour.\r\n\r\nNow I have no sympathy at all with the contemptuous tone adopted by\r\nmost Socialists towards the working man. This scorn of the average\r\nartisan or labourer may be regarded as the connecting bond between all\r\nschools of modern Socialism in this country, the one sentiment common\r\nto Mr. Hyndman and to Mr. Bernard Shaw. Were that scorn just, its\r\nexpression would be imprudent; for John Smith of Oldham, however stupid\r\nhe may be, is, as Mr. Blatchford has remarked “very numerous,” and in\r\na country ruled by the counting of heads it would be good policy to\r\ntreat him with respect and good humour. But it is not just. As a matter\r\nof fact, the working man is by no means the slavish imbecile that some\r\nSocialists seem to think him. The fact that he has built up with iron\r\nresolution, in the face of stupendous difficulties, and at the cost of\r\nterrible sacrifices, the Trade Union system of this country--perhaps\r\nthe noblest monument of the great qualities of the British character\r\nthat the century has seen--might well protect him from the sarcasms of\r\nwealthy idealists. If he is not a Socialist, is that altogether his\r\nfault? Or is it by any chance partly ours?\r\n\r\nThe British workman is not, as I have said, by any means a fool. He\r\ndoes not enjoy being sweated; he is not in love with long hours and\r\nlow wages; he does not clamour for bad housing or dear transit. On\r\nthe contrary, when sufficiently skilled and educated to be capable of\r\neffective organisation, he is a keen trade unionist, ready to stand\r\nup promptly and with conspicuous success for the rights and interests\r\nof his class; and he has shown himself able and willing to support\r\nlegislation for his own benefit and that of his fellows. The Socialists\r\nhave in him excellent raw material of which a most effective fighting\r\nforce could be made. How do they use him?\r\n\r\nThe first thing that a Socialist of the old school does, when brought\r\nface to face with a working class audience, is deliberately to insult\r\nit. I heard of one Socialist orator who began his address to an East\r\nEnd meeting with the sentence--“What are you? Dogs!” I suggest that\r\nthis is not the way to placate the unbeliever or to allay the suspicion\r\nwith which his conservative instincts lead him to regard a new idea.\r\nMoreover it is not true. The working man knows perfectly well that he\r\nand his class are not “dogs”; and he rightly concludes that a man so\r\nprofoundly ignorant of his condition is not the man to improve it.\r\nHowever, having collectively and individually insulted those whom he\r\nseeks to convert, the preacher launches joyously into the abysses\r\nand whirlpools of German philosophy and economics, calls his hearers\r\n“proletarians” (to their intense astonishment), tells them that they\r\nare being robbed of “surplus value,” discusses abstruse matters\r\nconcerning the relations between “exchange value” and “labour power,”\r\nand generally leads them through mazes of foreign scientific jargon\r\nfrom which they eventually emerge gasping for breath. Now I submit\r\nthat this is an absurd way of going to work. Not so did Cobden and his\r\nallies act, when they set out to convert the middle classes to the\r\ndogmas of Adam Smith. They had a systematic theory of economics as\r\nelaborate as that of the Marxian, but they did not pelt miscellaneous\r\npopular gatherings with its technicalities. They crystallised it into\r\none simple, effective and intelligible phrase,--“To buy in the cheapest\r\nmarket and to sell in the dearest.” I will not disguise my personal\r\nconviction that this maxim is of and from the Devil. But (perhaps for\r\nthat reason) it is lucid and unmistakeable and makes a definite and\r\npersuasive appeal to the instincts and prejudices of the commercial\r\nclasses. I fear I cannot say as much for the crystallizations favoured\r\nby Socialist propagandists. “The Abolition of the Wages System” and\r\n“Production for Use and not for Profit” convey to the workman, I\r\nimagine, no clearer meaning than they convey to me.\r\n\r\nI am aware that there has been of late in Socialist circles something\r\nof a reaction against this sort of thing, as also against the futile\r\nMarxian prophecies to the effect that “economic forces” would produce\r\na “Crisis” which would have the effect of abolishing the capitalist\r\nsystem whether anyone wanted it abolished or no. But the reaction\r\nhas taken an entirely wrong turn. It has resulted so far in nothing\r\nbetter than an outburst of sheer sentimentalism as unacceptable to\r\nthe hard conservative common-sense of the workers as the doctrinaire\r\nrevolutionism that preceded it. The chief expression of this\r\nsentimentalism may be found in the repudiation of the Class War by\r\nthe leaders of the I.L.P. and the substitution of vague talk about\r\nUniversal Love and the Brotherhood of Man. Now here the I.L.P. leaders\r\nhave got hold of quite the wrong end of the stick. The existence of\r\nthe class war is a fact of common observation. A short walk down any\r\nstreet with your eyes open will show it to you. Indeed it is obvious\r\nthat there is and must be a permanent antagonism between the buyers\r\nand sellers of labour--or if our hyper-economic critics prefer it of\r\n“labour-power.” And moreover this fact of the class war is a fact,\r\nwhich every workman (as also every capitalist) recognises in practice,\r\nif not in theory. All trade unionism is built upon his recognition of\r\nit; so is the demand for a labour party. The error of the S.D.F. did\r\nnot lie here.\r\n\r\nThe Marxians were not wrong in saying that there was a class war;\r\nthere is a class war. They were not wrong in saying that the worker\r\nought to be educated in class-consciousness; they ought to be so\r\neducated for their class-consciousness is the best foundation for our\r\npropaganda. Where the Marxians were wrong in regard to the class war\r\nwas in their tacit assumption that “class-consciousness” was identical\r\nwith Socialism. It is not. Socialists and Trade Unionists are alike in\r\ntheir _recognition_ of the class war, but they differ widely in their\r\nattitude towards it. The Socialist wishes so to organise society as\r\nto bring the Class War to an end; the Trade Unionist wants the war to\r\ngo on, but he wants his own class to get better chances in it than\r\nthey get at present. As regards practical matters the path of the two\r\nis for the present largely identical. Extended factory legislation,\r\nold age pensions, housing, the municipalisation of monopolies are\r\ndesired by Socialists and Trade Unionists alike, though not entirely\r\nfor the same reasons. Here and there, on Trade Union Law, on Compulsory\r\nArbitration in industrial disputes, in some instances on Child Labour,\r\nthe attitude of the two may appear different, but it only requires the\r\nbetter economic education of the unions to bring them into line with\r\nthe Socialists on these points. Nevertheless, the distinction as well\r\nas the relation between the two must be kept constantly in mind, if\r\nthe attitude of the typical manual worker towards Socialism is to be\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nI confess that it strikes me as a little absurd that the very wing of\r\nthe Socialist army which most enthusiastically defends the obviously\r\nsensible policy of forming an alliance with the Unions without asking\r\nits allies to swallow imposing Socialist formulae, should be the one\r\nto throw over the one effective link between Socialism and Trade\r\nUnionism,--the recognition of the Class War. The result of this\r\nrepudiation and of the high-sounding humanitarian rhetoric with which\r\nit is accompanied has been to hopelessly estrange the I.L.P. from the\r\nTrade Union movement, so that it is now hardly more influential in that\r\ndirection than the S.D.F. itself. The I.L.P. does indeed to some degree\r\nenlarge its boundaries, but the type of man it now principally attracts\r\nis not the trade unionist or the labourer. The sort of person who finds\r\nthe I.L.P. creed as mirrored in the utterance of Messrs. Keir Hardie\r\nand Bruce Glasier exactly to his taste is the wavering Nonconformist in\r\nprocess of ceasing to believe in God who is looking about for something\r\n“undenominational” to believe in. Universal Love, Brotherhood,\r\nRighteousness--all that sort of thing suits him down to the ground. The\r\nphenomenon is no new one in history. Just the same kind of sentiment\r\nunderlays the political propaganda of Isaac Butt, of Vergniaud, of Sir\r\nHarry Vane. Its track is across history; its name is Girondism, and\r\nits end has always been futility and disaster. The pious Girondins\r\nwere shocked at Danton’s declaration “terror is the order of the day,”\r\njust as the I.L.P. rhetoricians are shocked at the recognition of the\r\nClass War, because it contradicted their sentimental assumptions. But\r\nTerror was the order of the day, and it was only because Terror was the\r\norder of the day that France was saved from foreign conquerors and the\r\nRevolution became an accomplished fact.\r\n\r\nBut, if the worker really does recognise the class war and if the\r\npath of Socialism is for the present along the lines of the class\r\nwar, why does the worker distrust the Socialist? I have hinted at my\r\nanswer in a previous chapter, but I will take the present opportunity\r\nof elaborating it a little. When Socialists of either of the above\r\ntypes leave German dialect and Girondin declamation, which he does\r\nnot understand and come to practical business which he does, they\r\ngive the working man very little that he values and much that is\r\nprofoundly distasteful to him. When for example they touch on war and\r\nforeign politics they give him, under a veil of specious rhetoric\r\nwhich does not convince him, the general impression that they want\r\nto see England “licked.” He does not like this, and he expresses his\r\ndislike vehemently and not always very peaceably. Doubtless he often\r\nvents his anger on people whose patriotism is as real as his own, and\r\nwho merely differ from him as to the merits of some particular war or\r\nexpedition. But on the whole the astonishingly shrewd instincts of\r\nthe workers do not mislead them. They are right in feeling that there\r\nis in the Socialist movement a strong under-current of unmistakeable\r\nanti-patriotism, a genuine hatred and contempt for England and her\r\nhonour. If anyone doubts this, I do not think he has spent so much time\r\nin Socialist clubs as I have.\r\n\r\nIf all this anti-patriotic sentiment, which disgusts and repels the\r\nworkers so much, were an essential part of Socialism we might have to\r\naccept our unpopularity as the inevitable penalty of our convictions\r\nand make the best of it. But, if I have not proved that it is nothing\r\nof the sort, this book has been written in vain. Anti-patriotism,\r\nanti-imperialism, anti-militarism, these are not Socialist doctrines\r\nbut the faded relics of a particularly debased form of Liberalism.\r\nThere is nothing in Socialism to prevent us from appealing to the\r\npassionate patriotism of the masses; there is much in it to give point\r\nto such an appeal.\r\n\r\nThe workman is a Tory by instinct and tradition. He is a Jingo--a\r\nmuch healthier and more reputable Jingo than his brother of the\r\nstock-exchange,--but still a Jingo in the most emphatic sense. I am\r\nmoreover convinced that he is at heart a protectionist. He dislikes\r\nthe idea of a tax on bread, especially as Mr. Chamberlain gives\r\nhim no really convincing guarantee of better industrial conditions\r\nto follow; but I believe, and I note that I have the support of so\r\nirreproachable a Liberal and Free Trader as Mr. Brougham Villiers in\r\nthis belief, that, if at any time during the last quarter of a century\r\nthe protection of manufactures alone had been offered to the working\r\nclasses, they would have accepted it with the utmost eagerness. It is\r\nnoticeable that as soon as the workman goes to the Colonies he becomes\r\nan out and out Protectionist. This would hardly happen if he had\r\nimbibed the pure milk of Cobdenism with as much relish as the Liberals\r\nwould have us believe.\r\n\r\nHere then is your Tory Jingo Protectionist working man. What are you\r\ngoing to do with him? It is easy enough to abuse him, but he is your\r\nonly possible electoral material, he is the man by whose vote you have\r\ngot to establish Socialism if it is to be established at all. There are\r\nmuch fewer Liberals than Tories among the workers and such as there\r\nare will much less readily join you, for they represent generally the\r\nuncompromising individualist Radicalism which spread from the middle\r\norders down through the upper ranks of the artisans during the dark\r\ndays of Manchester ascendancy. It is from the Tory much more than from\r\nthe Liberal worker that the Labour party gets its votes,[11] even now,\r\nwhile its still burdened with a dead weight of senseless Liberal\r\ntraditions. How much greater would its expansive force become if once\r\nthis burden was removed.\r\n\r\nWhat deduction must we draw from these things? Surely this; that we\r\nmust appeal to the working classes on a double programme of practical\r\nand immediate industrial reform at home and at the same time of\r\nimperial federation, a spirited foreign policy and adequate provision\r\nfor national defence. I believe this experiment would succeed, at any\r\nrate it has never yet been effectively tried. When Mr. Bernard Shaw\r\ntaunts the workers with their steady Tory voting, one feels disposed to\r\nask him what he expects. Surely he would not have them vote Liberal?\r\nAnd if he replies that they should vote Socialist, one may throw down\r\nthis direct challenge--Would Mr. Shaw himself (the most brilliant,\r\nthe most acute and the most sincere of English Socialists) vote for a\r\ngood many of the Socialist and “Labour” candidates who have from time\r\nto time presented themselves before the British electorate? Would he\r\nnot himself often prefer a Tory? But is there any reason to suppose\r\nthat if a leader came to us with the specific talent and temperament\r\nof the demagogue (the value of which to a politician Mr. Shaw knows as\r\nwell and regards as highly as I do) and made his appeal on the Fabian\r\nprogramme plus a vigorous and intelligent Imperialism, the people of\r\nEngland would refuse to return him? I think not.\r\n\r\nIf the Labour party could only be persuaded to make such an appeal it\r\nmight yet redeem its mistakes and become a dominant force in politics.\r\nIf not, if we go on as we have been going on in the past,--if\r\nthe S.D.F. goes on pelting the “class-conscious proletariat” with\r\nmulti-syllabled German metaphysics, if the I.L.P. continues to give\r\naltruistic and humanitarian commonplaces to those who ask for bread,\r\nif some of the brilliant _intellectuels_ of middle class Socialism\r\ncontinue to treat the working classes as if they did not matter and\r\ncould be trapped into Socialism against their will,--if in a word\r\nwe go on insulting and bewildering those whom we wish to convert,\r\naddressing them in all the unintelligible tongues of Babel and forcing\r\ndown their throats doctrines which they detest, then we shall never\r\nlead the workers. And if we do not lead them someone else will. Yes\r\nsomeday we shall be faced in this country by the appearance of a man\r\nwho understands the working classes and can make them follow him. All\r\nparties will look at him askance the Labour party most of all. He will\r\nbe called “Jingo,” “Reactionist,” “Taker of Tory Gold.” But he will\r\nhave the people of England behind him, because he will comprehend them\r\nand believe in them, desire what they desire, feel as they feel. And if\r\nhe does what such a man did once in this country, when the “Girondin”\r\nVanes and Sydneys were babbling about “democratic ideals” as we are\r\nbabbling now, if he drives our talkative and incompetent Commons from\r\ntheir House and establishes a popular Caesarism on the ruins of our\r\npolity,--the blame will not be his. The blame will be ours. It will be\r\nours because we, whose mission it was to lead the people could only\r\nfind time to despise the people,--because we could not and would not\r\nunderstand!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Note for example the action of the Irish Members in securing the\r\nexclusion of Convent Laundries from the operation of the Factory\r\nActs--action of which every enlightened Roman Catholic, to whom I have\r\nspoken of it, has expressed strong disapproval.\r\n\r\n[2] Social Democracy and the Armed Nation, Twentieth Century Press, 37a\r\nClerkenwell Green, E.C. 1d.\r\n\r\n[3] Fabianism and the Empire, edited by Bernard Shaw, the Fabian\r\nSociety, 3, Clements Inn, W.C. 3d.\r\n\r\n[4] There is one of Mr. Blatchford’s proposals to which I feel the\r\nstrongest possible objection; that is the suggestion that those who do\r\nnot volunteer for his citizen force should pay extra taxation. This\r\nsounds fair enough, no doubt, but its effect would clearly be that\r\nthe rich could escape service and the poor could not--which is hardly\r\na Socialist ideal. Surely it is sounder policy to make such citizen\r\ntraining as you give compulsory for all able-bodied citizens.\r\n\r\n[5] Since these pages were sent to the press a striking confirmation\r\nof my view has been furnished by recent occurrences in Russia. There,\r\nit will be remembered, the populace (acting on strictly Tolstoian\r\nprinciples) marched _unarmed_ to lay their grievances before their\r\nSovereign. We all know what happened. They were shot down and cut to\r\npieces by Cossacks. One hopes that the survivors will be less faithful\r\nto Count Tolstoi’s gospel in the future, and will perhaps realise that\r\n“moral force” is an exceedingly poor protection against bullets and\r\nbayonets.\r\n\r\n[6] Lest I should be accused of “sitting on the fence” (a phrase much\r\nbeloved by those who always want to have judgment first and evidence\r\nafterwards) I may as well state definitely that in my opinion a\r\nprotective tariff, if framed by genuine reformers solely in the public\r\ninterest, would be decidedly advantageous to Labour.\r\n\r\n[7] I omit mention of the proviso whereby certain Non-County Boroughs\r\nand Urban District Councils have authority over Elementary but not over\r\nHigher Education. The concession was a most unfortunate one, but it\r\ndoes not affect the general drift of my argument.\r\n\r\n[8] The gentleman in question announced, if I remember rightly that he\r\nproposed to avoid this misunderstanding by showing in his front garden\r\na placard with the inscription--\r\n\r\n“MY GOODS ARE BEING SOLD TO PROMOTE RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE.”\r\n\r\n--a remarkably candid confession!\r\n\r\n[9] _The Case for Municipal Drink_ by E. R. Pease (King & Son).\r\n\r\n[10] The Labour Party might also take up the question of the\r\ndevelopment of Crown Lands (especially those containing minerals), to\r\nwhich Mr. Sheridan Jones has lately been drawing public attention.\r\n\r\n[11] A good illustration of this may be obtained by comparing the two\r\nby-elections which have taken place since the present parliament was\r\nelected, in North-East Lanarkshire. In both cases a typical orthodox\r\nUnionist and a typical orthodox Labourite were in the field. But the\r\nLiberal candidates were of a very different type in the two cases. In\r\nSeptember 1901 (while the South African War was still in progress)\r\nthe Liberal candidate was Mr. Cecil Harmsworth, of the “Daily Mail,”\r\nan Imperialist of so pronounced a kind that all the organs of the\r\nAnti-Imperialist press and many of the Leaders of Anti-Imperialist\r\nLiberalism advised the electors to vote for the Labour candidate. This\r\nyear on the other hand the Liberal candidate was a strictly orthodox\r\nLiberal who succeeded in uniting all sections of the party. I give the\r\nfigures for both elections.\r\n\r\n       By-election 26/9/01.\r\n\r\n  Sir W. Rattigan (U)         5673\r\n\r\n  Mr. C. Harmsworth (L)       4769\r\n\r\n  Mr. R. Smillie (Lab)        2900\r\n\r\n       By-election 10/5/04.\r\n\r\n  Mr. Finlay (L)              5619\r\n\r\n  Mr. Touch (U)               4677\r\n\r\n  Mr. Robertson (Lab)         3984\r\n\r\nThe noticeable thing about these figures is the enormous increase in\r\nthe Labour poll. It may reasonably be supposed that the fulminations\r\nof a large section of representative Liberal opinion against Mr.\r\nHarmsworth produced some effect on the voting, and one may therefore\r\ntake it that a fair number of electors, who voted for Mr. Smillie in\r\n1901, voted for Mr. Finlay in 1904. Yet Mr. Robertson’s gain is far\r\ngreater than Mr. Finlay’s. This can only mean that a large number\r\nof working men, who, in time of war voted for the Tory Imperialist\r\ncandidate, voted for the Labour candidate in time of peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThis eBook makes the following corrections to the original text:\r\n\r\n    Pg 23 “pratically” changed to “practically”\r\n    Pg 47 comma added after “origin”\r\n    Pg 53 comma added after “leave”\r\n    Pg 57 “Ultramonanism” changed to “Ultramontanism”\r\n    Pg 63 “inpossible” changed to “impossible”\r\n    Pg 64 period added after “divisions”\r\n    Pg 70 “ebulition” changed to “ebullition”\r\n    Pg 72 comma added after “attacked”\r\n    Pg 77 period added after “unconscious”\r\n    Pg 84 comma changed to period after “system”\r\n    Pg 95 period added to “Mr Chamberlain”\r\n    Pg 107 period removed before colon\r\n    Pg 116 “repudition” changed to “repudiation”\r\n    Pg 119 period added after “Voluntary School”\r\n    Pg 124 period added after “ad hoc”\r\n    Pg 124 comma added after “foreign affairs”\r\n    Pg 131 “nausious” changed to “nauseous”\r\n    Pg 144 “shold” changed to “should”\r\n    Pg 147 “couse” changed to “course”\r\n    Pg 149 “abandon the the” changed to “abandons the”\r\n    Pg 150 period added after “for it”\r\n    Pg 152 period added after “statesmanship”\r\n    Pg 156 period added after “surroundings”\r\n    Pg 167 “inadmissable” changed to “inadmissible”\r\n    Pg 168 “attentuated” changed to “attenuated”\r\n    Pg 182 comma added after “a priori logic”\r\n    Pg 183 “economic of political” changed to “economic or political”\r\n    Pg 198 “socialogical” changed to “sociological”\r\n    Pg 199 “develope” changed to “develop”\r\n    Pg 209 period added after “kind”\r\n    Pg 218 “to-wards” changed to “towards”\r\n    Pg 202 “employées” changed to “employés”\r\n    Pg 225 “artizans” changed to “artisans”\r\n    Pg 230 comma changed to period after “Gold”",
