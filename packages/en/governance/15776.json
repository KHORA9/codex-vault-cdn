Very few of us realize with conviction the\r\nintensely unusual, unstable, complicated, unreliable, temporary nature\r\nof the economic organization by which Western Europe has lived for the\r\nlast half century. We assume some of the most peculiar and temporary of\r\nour late advantages as natural, permanent, and to be depended on, and we\r\nlay our plans accordingly. On this sandy and false foundation we scheme\r\nfor social improvement and dress our political platforms, pursue our\r\nanimosities and particular ambitions, and feel ourselves with enough\r\nmargin in hand to foster, not assuage, civil conflict in the European\r\nfamily. Moved by insane delusion and reckless self-regard, the German\r\npeople overturned the foundations on which we all lived and built. But\r\nthe spokesmen of the French and British peoples have run the risk of\r\ncompleting the ruin, which Germany began, by a Peace which, if it is\r\ncarried into effect, must impair yet further, when it might have\r\nrestored, the delicate, complicated organization, already shaken and\r\nbroken by war, through which alone the European peoples can employ\r\nthemselves and live.\r\n\r\nIn England the outward aspect of life does not yet teach us to feel or\r\nrealize in the least that an age is over. We are busy picking up the\r\nthreads of our life where we dropped them, with this difference only,\r\nthat many of us seem a good deal richer than we were before. Where we\r\nspent millions before the war, we have now learnt that we can spend\r\nhundreds of millions and apparently not suffer for it. Evidently we did\r\nnot exploit to the utmost the possibilities of our economic life. We\r\nlook, therefore, not only to a return to the comforts of 1914, but to an\r\nimmense broadening and intensification of them. All classes alike thus\r\nbuild their plans, the rich to spend more and save less, the poor to\r\nspend more and work less.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps it is only in England (and America) that it is possible to\r\nbe so unconscious. In continental Europe the earth heaves and no one but\r\nis aware of the rumblings. There it is not just a matter of extravagance\r\nor \"labor troubles\"; but of life and death, of starvation and existence,\r\nand of the fearful convulsions of a dying civilization.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor one who spent in Paris the greater part of the six months which\r\nsucceeded the Armistice an occasional visit to London was a strange\r\nexperience. England still stands outside Europe. Europe's voiceless\r\ntremors do not reach her. Europe is apart and England is not of her\r\nflesh and body. But Europe is solid with herself. France, Germany,\r\nItaly, Austria and Holland, Russia and Roumania and Poland, throb\r\ntogether, and their structure and civilization are essentially one. They\r\nflourished together, they have rocked together in a war, which we, in\r\nspite of our enormous contributions and sacrifices (like though in a\r\nless degree than America), economically stood outside, and they may fall\r\ntogether. In this lies the destructive significance of the Peace of\r\nParis. If the European Civil War is to end with France and Italy abusing\r\ntheir momentary victorious power to destroy Germany and Austria-Hungary\r\nnow prostrate, they invite their own destruction also, being so deeply\r\nand inextricably intertwined with their victims by hidden psychic and\r\neconomic bonds. At any rate an Englishman who took part in the\r\nConference of Paris and was during those months a member of the Supreme\r\nEconomic Council of the Allied Powers, was bound to become, for him a\r\nnew experience, a European in his cares and outlook. There, at the nerve\r\ncenter of the European system, his British preoccupations must largely\r\nfall away and he must be haunted by other and more dreadful specters.\r\nParis was a nightmare, and every one there was morbid. A sense of\r\nimpending catastrophe overhung the frivolous scene; the futility and\r\nsmallness of man before the great events confronting him; the mingled\r\nsignificance and unreality of the decisions; levity, blindness,\r\ninsolence, confused cries from without,--all the elements of ancient\r\ntragedy were there. Seated indeed amid the theatrical trappings of the\r\nFrench Saloons of State, one could wonder if the extraordinary visages\r\nof Wilson and of Clemenceau, with their fixed hue and unchanging\r\ncharacterization, were really faces at all and not the tragi-comic masks\r\nof some strange drama or puppet-show.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of Paris all had this air of extraordinary importance\r\nand unimportance at the same time. The decisions seemed charged with\r\nconsequences to the future of human society; yet the air whispered that\r\nthe word was not flesh, that it was futile, insignificant, of no effect,\r\ndissociated from events; and one felt most strongly the impression,\r\ndescribed by Tolstoy in _War and Peace_ or by Hardy in _The Dynasts_, of\r\nevents marching on to their fated conclusion uninfluenced and unaffected\r\nby the cerebrations of Statesmen in Council:\r\n\r\n        _Spirit of the Years_\r\n\r\n    Observe that all wide sight and self-command\r\n    Deserts these throngs now driven to demonry\r\n    By the Immanent Unrecking. Nought remains\r\n    But vindictiveness here amid the strong,\r\n    And there amid the weak an impotent rage.\r\n\r\n        _Spirit of the Pities_\r\n\r\n    Why prompts the Will so senseless-shaped a doing?\r\n\r\n        _Spirit of the Years_\r\n\r\n    I have told thee that It works unwittingly,\r\n    As one possessed not judging.\r\n\r\nIn Paris, where those connected with the Supreme Economic Council,\r\nreceived almost hourly the reports of the misery, disorder, and decaying\r\norganization of all Central and Eastern Europe, allied and enemy alike,\r\nand learnt from the lips of the financial representatives of Germany and\r\nAustria unanswerable evidence, of the terrible exhaustion of their\r\ncountries, an occasional visit to the hot, dry room in the President's\r\nhouse, where the Four fulfilled their destinies in empty and arid\r\nintrigue, only added to the sense of nightmare. Yet there in Paris the\r\nproblems of Europe were terrible and clamant, and an occasional return\r\nto the vast unconcern of London a little disconcerting. For in London\r\nthese questions were very far away, and our own lesser problems alone\r\ntroubling. London believed that Paris was making a great confusion of\r\nits business, but remained uninterested. In this spirit the British\r\npeople received the Treaty without reading it. But it is under the\r\ninfluence of Paris, not London, that this book has been written by one\r\nwho, though an Englishman, feels himself a European also, and, because\r\nof too vivid recent experience, cannot disinterest himself from the\r\nfurther unfolding of the great historic drama of these days which will\r\ndestroy great institutions, but may also create a new world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nEUROPE BEFORE THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore 1870 different parts of the small continent of Europe had\r\nspecialized in their own products; but, taken as a whole, it was\r\nsubstantially self-subsistent. And its population was adjusted to this\r\nstate of affairs.\r\n\r\nAfter 1870 there was developed on a large scale an unprecedented\r\nsituation, and the economic condition of Europe became during the next\r\nfifty years unstable and peculiar. The pressure of population on food,\r\nwhich had already been balanced by the accessibility of supplies from\r\nAmerica, became for the first time in recorded history definitely\r\nreversed. As numbers increased, food was actually easier to secure.\r\nLarger proportional returns from an increasing scale of production\r\nbecame true of agriculture as well as industry. With the growth of the\r\nEuropean population there were more emigrants on the one hand to till\r\nthe soil of the new countries, and, on the other, more workmen were\r\navailable in Europe to prepare the industrial products and capital goods\r\nwhich were to maintain the emigrant populations in their new homes, and\r\nto build the railways and ships which were to make accessible to Europe\r\nfood and raw products from distant sources. Up to about 1900 a unit of\r\nlabor applied to industry yielded year by year a purchasing power over\r\nan increasing quantity of food. It is possible that about the year 1900\r\nthis process began to be reversed, and a diminishing yield of Nature to\r\nman's effort was beginning to reassert itself. But the tendency of\r\ncereals to rise in real cost was balanced by other improvements;\r\nand--one of many novelties--the resources of tropical Africa then for\r\nthe first time came into large employ, and a great traffic in oil-seeds\r\nbegan to bring to the table of Europe in a new and cheaper form one of\r\nthe essential foodstuffs of mankind. In this economic Eldorado, in this\r\neconomic Utopia, as the earlier economists would have deemed it, most of\r\nus were brought up.\r\n\r\nThat happy age lost sight of a view of the world which filled with\r\ndeep-seated melancholy the founders of our Political Economy. Before the\r\neighteenth century mankind entertained no false hopes. To lay the\r\nillusions which grew popular at that age's latter end, Malthus disclosed\r\na Devil. For half a century all serious economical writings held that\r\nDevil in clear prospect. For the next half century he was chained up and\r\nout of sight. Now perhaps we have loosed him again.\r\n\r\nWhat an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age\r\nwas which came to an end in August, 1914! The greater part of the\r\npopulation, it is true, worked hard and lived at a low standard of\r\ncomfort, yet were, to all appearances, reasonably contented with this\r\nlot. But escape was possible, for any man of capacity or character at\r\nall exceeding the average, into the middle and upper classes, for whom\r\nlife offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, conveniences,\r\ncomforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most\r\npowerful monarchs of other ages. The inhabitant of London could order by\r\ntelephone, sipping his morning tea in bed, the various products of the\r\nwhole earth, in such quantity as he might see fit, and reasonably expect\r\ntheir early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and\r\nby the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new\r\nenterprises of any quarter of the world, and share, without exertion or\r\neven trouble, in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he could\r\ndecide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the\r\ntownspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy\r\nor information might recommend. He could secure forthwith, if he wished\r\nit, cheap and comfortable means of transit to any country or climate\r\nwithout passport or other formality, could despatch his servant to the\r\nneighboring office of a bank for such supply of the precious metals as\r\nmight seem convenient, and could then proceed abroad to foreign\r\nquarters, without knowledge of their religion, language, or customs,\r\nbearing coined wealth upon his person, and would consider himself\r\ngreatly aggrieved and much surprised at the least interference. But,\r\nmost important of all, he regarded this state of affairs as normal,\r\ncertain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement,\r\nand any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable. The\r\nprojects and politics of militarism and imperialism, of racial and\r\ncultural rivalries, of monopolies, restrictions, and exclusion, which\r\nwere to play the serpent to this paradise, were little more than the\r\namusements of his daily newspaper, and appeared to exercise almost no\r\ninfluence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life, the\r\ninternationalization of which was nearly complete in practice.\r\n\r\nIt will assist us to appreciate the character and consequences of the\r\nPeace which we have imposed on our enemies, if I elucidate a little\r\nfurther some of the chief unstable elements already present when war\r\nbroke out, in the economic life of Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Population_\r\n\r\nIn 1870 Germany had a population of about 40,000,000. By 1892 this\r\nfigure had risen to 50,000,000, and by June 30, 1914, to about\r\n68,000,000. In the years immediately preceding the war the annual\r\nincrease was about 850,000, of whom an insignificant proportion\r\nemigrated.[1] This great increase was only rendered possible by a\r\nfar-reaching transformation of the economic structure of the country.\r\nFrom being agricultural and mainly self-supporting, Germany transformed\r\nherself into a vast and complicated industrial machine, dependent for\r\nits working on the equipoise of many factors outside Germany as well as\r\nwithin. Only by operating this machine, continuously and at full blast,\r\ncould she find occupation at home for her increasing population and the\r\nmeans of purchasing their subsistence from abroad. The German machine\r\nwas like a top which to maintain its equilibrium must spin ever faster\r\nand faster.\r\n\r\nIn the Austro-Hungarian Empire, which grew from about 40,000,000 in 1890\r\nto at least 50,000,000 at the outbreak of war, the same tendency was\r\npresent in a less degree, the annual excess of births over deaths being\r\nabout half a million, out of which, however, there was an annual\r\nemigration of some quarter of a million persons.\r\n\r\nTo understand the present situation, we must apprehend with vividness\r\nwhat an extraordinary center of population the development of the\r\nGermanic system had enabled Central Europe to become. Before the war the\r\npopulation of Germany and Austria-Hungary together not only\r\nsubstantially exceeded that of the United States, but was about equal to\r\nthat of the whole of North America. In these numbers, situated within a\r\ncompact territory, lay the military strength of the Central Powers. But\r\nthese same numbers--for even the war has not appreciably diminished\r\nthem[2]--if deprived of the means of life, remain a hardly less danger\r\nto European order.\r\n\r\nEuropean Russia increased her population in a degree even greater than\r\nGermany--from less than 100,000,000 in 1890 to about 150,000,000 at the\r\noutbreak of war;[3] and in the year immediately preceding 1914 the\r\nexcess of births over deaths in Russia as a whole was at the prodigious\r\nrate of two millions per annum. This inordinate growth in the population\r\nof Russia, which has not been widely noticed in England, has been\r\nnevertheless one of the most significant facts of recent years.\r\n\r\nThe great events of history are often due to secular changes in the\r\ngrowth of population and other fundamental economic causes, which,\r\nescaping by their gradual character the notice of contemporary\r\nobservers, are attributed to the follies of statesmen or the fanaticism\r\nof atheists. Thus the extraordinary occurrences of the past two years in\r\nRussia, that vast upheaval of Society, which has overturned what seemed\r\nmost stable--religion, the basis of property, the ownership of land, as\r\nwell as forms of government and the hierarchy of classes--may owe more\r\nto the deep influences of expanding numbers than to Lenin or to\r\nNicholas; and the disruptive powers of excessive national fecundity may\r\nhave played a greater part in bursting the bonds of convention than\r\neither the power of ideas or the errors of autocracy.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _Organization_\r\n\r\nThe delicate organization by which these peoples lived depended partly\r\non factors internal to the system.\r\n\r\nThe interference of frontiers and of tariffs was reduced to a minimum,\r\nand not far short of three hundred millions of people lived within the\r\nthree Empires of Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary. The various\r\ncurrencies, which were all maintained on a stable basis in relation to\r\ngold and to one another, facilitated the easy flow of capital and of\r\ntrade to an extent the full value of which we only realize now, when we\r\nare deprived of its advantages. Over this great area there was an almost\r\nabsolute security of property and of person.\r\n\r\nThese factors of order, security, and uniformity, which Europe had never\r\nbefore enjoyed over so wide and populous a territory or for so long a\r\nperiod, prepared the way for the organization of that vast mechanism of\r\ntransport, coal distribution, and foreign trade which made possible an\r\nindustrial order of life in the dense urban centers of new population.\r\nThis is too well known to require detailed substantiation with figures.\r\nBut it may be illustrated by the figures for coal, which has been the\r\nkey to the industrial growth of Central Europe hardly less than of\r\nEngland; the output of German coal grew from 30,000,000 tons in 1871 to\r\n70,000,000 tons in 1890, 110,000,000 tons in 1900, and 190,000,000 tons\r\nin 1913.\r\n\r\nRound Germany as a central support the rest of the European economic\r\nsystem grouped itself, and on the prosperity and enterprise of Germany\r\nthe prosperity of the rest of the Continent mainly depended. The\r\nincreasing pace of Germany gave her neighbors an outlet for their\r\nproducts, in exchange for which the enterprise of the German merchant\r\nsupplied them with their chief requirements at a low price.\r\n\r\nThe statistics of the economic interdependence of Germany and her\r\nneighbors are overwhelming. Germany was the best customer of Russia,\r\nNorway, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, Italy, and Austria-Hungary; she\r\nwas the second best customer of Great Britain, Sweden, and Denmark; and\r\nthe third best customer of France. She was the largest source of supply\r\nto Russia, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Holland, Switzerland, Italy,\r\nAustria-Hungary, Roumania, and Bulgaria; and the second largest source\r\nof supply to Great Britain, Belgium, and France.\r\n\r\nIn our own case we sent more exports to Germany than to any other\r\ncountry in the world except India, and we bought more from her than from\r\nany other country in the world except the United States.\r\n\r\nThere was no European country except those west of Germany which did not\r\ndo more than a quarter of their total trade with her; and in the case of\r\nRussia, Austria-Hungary, and Holland the proportion was far greater.\r\n\r\nGermany not only furnished these countries with trade, but, in the case\r\nof some of them, supplied a great part of the capital needed for their\r\nown development. Of Germany's pre-war foreign investments, amounting in\r\nall to about $6,250,000,000, not far short of $2,500,000,000 was\r\ninvested in Russia, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, Roumania, and Turkey.[4]\r\nAnd by the system of \"peaceful penetration\" she gave these countries not\r\nonly capital, but, what they needed hardly less, organization. The whole\r\nof Europe east of the Rhine thus fell into the German industrial orbit,\r\nand its economic life was adjusted accordingly.\r\n\r\nBut these internal factors would not have been sufficient to enable the\r\npopulation to support itself without the co-operation of external\r\nfactors also and of certain general dispositions common to the whole of\r\nEurope. Many of the circumstances already treated were true of Europe as\r\na whole, and were not peculiar to the Central Empires. But all of what\r\nfollows was common to the whole European system.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _The Psychology of Society_\r\n\r\nEurope was so organized socially and economically as to secure the\r\nmaximum accumulation of capital. While there was some continuous\r\nimprovement in the daily conditions of life of the mass of the\r\npopulation, Society was so framed as to throw a great part of the\r\nincreased income into the control of the class least likely to consume\r\nit. The new rich of the nineteenth century were not brought up to large\r\nexpenditures, and preferred the power which investment gave them to the\r\npleasures of immediate consumption. In fact, it was precisely the\r\n_inequality_ of the distribution of wealth which made possible those\r\nvast accumulations of fixed wealth and of capital improvements which\r\ndistinguished that age from all others. Herein lay, in fact, the main\r\njustification of the Capitalist System. If the rich had spent their new\r\nwealth on their own enjoyments, the world would long ago have found such\r\na rÈgime intolerable. But like bees they saved and accumulated, not less\r\nto the advantage of the whole community because they themselves held\r\nnarrower ends in prospect.\r\n\r\nThe immense accumulations of fixed capital which, to the great benefit\r\nof mankind, were built up during the half century before the war, could\r\nnever have come about in a Society where wealth was divided equitably.\r\nThe railways of the world, which that age built as a monument to\r\nposterity, were, not less than the Pyramids of Egypt, the work of labor\r\nwhich was not free to consume in immediate enjoyment the full equivalent\r\nof its efforts.\r\n\r\nThus this remarkable system depended for its growth on a double bluff or\r\ndeception. On the one hand the laboring classes accepted from ignorance\r\nor powerlessness, or were compelled, persuaded, or cajoled by custom,\r\nconvention, authority, and the well-established order of Society into\r\naccepting, a situation in which they could call their own very little of\r\nthe cake that they and Nature and the capitalists were co-operating to\r\nproduce. And on the other hand the capitalist classes were allowed to\r\ncall the best part of the cake theirs and were theoretically free to\r\nconsume it, on the tacit underlying condition that they consumed very\r\nlittle of it in practice. The duty of \"saving\" became nine-tenths of\r\nvirtue and the growth of the cake the object of true religion. There\r\ngrew round the non-consumption of the cake all those instincts of\r\npuritanism which in other ages has withdrawn itself from the world and\r\nhas neglected the arts of production as well as those of enjoyment. And\r\nso the cake increased; but to what end was not clearly contemplated.\r\nIndividuals would be exhorted not so much to abstain as to defer, and to\r\ncultivate the pleasures of security and anticipation. Saving was for old\r\nage or for your children; but this was only in theory,--the virtue of\r\nthe cake was that it was never to be consumed, neither by you nor by\r\nyour children after you.\r\n\r\nIn writing thus I do not necessarily disparage the practices of that\r\ngeneration. In the unconscious recesses of its being Society knew what\r\nit was about. The cake was really very small in proportion to the\r\nappetites of consumption, and no one, if it were shared all round, would\r\nbe much the better off by the cutting of it. Society was working not\r\nfor the small pleasures of to-day but for the future security and\r\nimprovement of the race,--in fact for \"progress.\" If only the cake were\r\nnot cut but was allowed to grow in the geometrical proportion predicted\r\nby Malthus of population, but not less true of compound interest,\r\nperhaps a day might come when there would at last be enough to go round,\r\nand when posterity could enter into the enjoyment of _our_ labors. In\r\nthat day overwork, overcrowding, and underfeeding would have come to an\r\nend, and men, secure of the comforts and necessities of the body, could\r\nproceed to the nobler exercises of their faculties. One geometrical\r\nratio might cancel another, and the nineteenth century was able to\r\nforget the fertility of the species in a contemplation of the dizzy\r\nvirtues of compound interest.\r\n\r\nThere were two pitfalls in this prospect: lest, population still\r\noutstripping accumulation, our self-denials promote not happiness but\r\nnumbers; and lest the cake be after all consumed, prematurely, in war,\r\nthe consumer of all such hopes.\r\n\r\nBut these thoughts lead too far from my present purpose. I seek only to\r\npoint out that the principle of accumulation based on inequality was a\r\nvital part of the pre-war order of Society and of progress as we then\r\nunderstood it, and to emphasize that this principle depended on unstable\r\npsychological conditions, which it may be impossible to recreate. It\r\nwas not natural for a population, of whom so few enjoyed the comforts of\r\nlife, to accumulate so hugely. The war has disclosed the possibility of\r\nconsumption to all and the vanity of abstinence to many. Thus the bluff\r\nis discovered; the laboring classes may be no longer willing to forego\r\nso largely, and the capitalist classes, no longer confident of the\r\nfuture, may seek to enjoy more fully their liberties of consumption so\r\nlong as they last, and thus precipitate the hour of their confiscation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Relation of the Old World to the New_\r\n\r\nThe accumulative habits of Europe before the war were the necessary\r\ncondition of the greatest of the external factors which maintained the\r\nEuropean equipoise.\r\n\r\nOf the surplus capital goods accumulated by Europe a substantial part\r\nwas exported abroad, where its investment made possible the development\r\nof the new resources of food, materials, and transport, and at the same\r\ntime enabled the Old World to stake out a claim in the natural wealth\r\nand virgin potentialities of the New. This last factor came to be of the\r\nvastest importance. The Old World employed with an immense prudence the\r\nannual tribute it was thus entitled to draw. The benefit of cheap and\r\nabundant supplies resulting from the new developments which its surplus\r\ncapital had made possible, was, it is true, enjoyed and not postponed.\r\nBut the greater part of the money interest accruing on these foreign\r\ninvestments was reinvested and allowed to accumulate, as a reserve (it\r\nwas then hoped) against the less happy day when the industrial labor of\r\nEurope could no longer purchase on such easy terms the produce of other\r\ncontinents, and when the due balance would be threatened between its\r\nhistorical civilizations and the multiplying races of other climates and\r\nenvironments. Thus the whole of the European races tended to benefit\r\nalike from the development of new resources whether they pursued their\r\nculture at home or adventured it abroad.\r\n\r\nEven before the war, however, the equilibrium thus established between\r\nold civilizations and new resources was being threatened. The prosperity\r\nof Europe was based on the facts that, owing to the large exportable\r\nsurplus of foodstuffs in America, she was able to purchase food at a\r\ncheap rate measured in terms of the labor required to produce her own\r\nexports, and that, as a result of her previous investments of capital,\r\nshe was entitled to a substantial amount annually without any payment in\r\nreturn at all. The second of these factors then seemed out of danger,\r\nbut, as a result of the growth of population overseas, chiefly in the\r\nUnited States, the first was not so secure.\r\n\r\nWhen first the virgin soils of America came into bearing, the\r\nproportions of the population of those continents themselves, and\r\nconsequently of their own local requirements, to those of Europe were\r\nvery small. As lately as 1890 Europe had a population three times that\r\nof North and South America added together. But by 1914 the domestic\r\nrequirements of the United States for wheat were approaching their\r\nproduction, and the date was evidently near when there would be an\r\nexportable surplus only in years of exceptionally favorable harvest.\r\nIndeed, the present domestic requirements of the United States are\r\nestimated at more than ninety per cent of the average yield of the five\r\nyears 1909-1913.[5] At that time, however, the tendency towards\r\nstringency was showing itself, not so much in a lack of abundance as in\r\na steady increase of real cost. That is to say, taking the world as a\r\nwhole, there was no deficiency of wheat, but in order to call forth an\r\nadequate supply it was necessary to offer a higher real price. The most\r\nfavorable factor in the situation was to be found in the extent to which\r\nCentral and Western Europe was being fed from the exportable surplus of\r\nRussia and Roumania.\r\n\r\nIn short, Europe's claim on the resources of the New World was becoming\r\nprecarious; the law of diminishing returns was at last reasserting\r\nitself and was making it necessary year by year for Europe to offer a\r\ngreater quantity of other commodities to obtain the same amount of\r\nbread; and Europe, therefore, could by no means afford the\r\ndisorganization of any of her principal sources of supply.\r\n\r\nMuch else might be said in an attempt to portray the economic\r\npeculiarities of the Europe of 1914. I have selected for emphasis the\r\nthree or four greatest factors of instability,--the instability of an\r\nexcessive population dependent for its livelihood on a complicated and\r\nartificial organization, the psychological instability of the laboring\r\nand capitalist classes, and the instability of Europe's claim, coupled\r\nwith the completeness of her dependence, on the food supplies of the New\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\nThe war had so shaken this system as to endanger the life of Europe\r\naltogether. A great part of the Continent was sick and dying; its\r\npopulation was greatly in excess of the numbers for which a livelihood\r\nwas available; its organization was destroyed, its transport system\r\nruptured, and its food supplies terribly impaired.\r\n\r\nIt was the task of the Peace Conference to honor engagements and to\r\nsatisfy justice; but not less to re-establish life and to heal wounds.\r\nThese tasks were dictated as much by prudence as by the magnanimity\r\nwhich the wisdom of antiquity approved in victors. We will examine in\r\nthe following chapters the actual character of the Peace.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] In 1913 there were 25,843 emigrants from Germany, of whom\r\n19,124 went to the United States.\r\n\r\n[2] The net decrease of the German population at the end of\r\n1918 by decline of births and excess of deaths as compared with the\r\nbeginning of 1914, is estimated at about 2,700,000.\r\n\r\n[3] Including Poland and Finland, but excluding Siberia,\r\nCentral Asia, and the Caucasus.\r\n\r\n[4] Sums of money mentioned in this book in terms of dollars\r\nhave been converted from pounds sterling at the rate of $5 to £1.\r\n\r\n[5] Even since 1914 the population of the United States has\r\nincreased by seven or eight millions. As their annual consumption of\r\nwheat per head is not less than 6 bushels, the pre-war scale of\r\nproduction in the United States would only show a substantial surplus\r\nover present domestic requirements in about one year out of five. We\r\nhave been saved for the moment by the great harvests of 1918 and 1919,\r\nwhich have been called forth by Mr. Hoover's guaranteed price. But the\r\nUnited States can hardly be expected to continue indefinitely to raise\r\nby a substantial figure the cost of living in its own country, in order\r\nto provide wheat for a Europe which cannot pay for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chapters IV. and V. I shall study in some detail the economic and\r\nfinancial provisions of the Treaty of Peace with Germany. But it will be\r\neasier to appreciate the true origin of many of these terms if we\r\nexamine here some of the personal factors which influenced their\r\npreparation. In attempting this task, I touch, inevitably, questions of\r\nmotive, on which spectators are liable to error and are not entitled to\r\ntake on themselves the responsibilities of final judgment. Yet, if I\r\nseem in this chapter to assume sometimes the liberties which are\r\nhabitual to historians, but which, in spite of the greater knowledge\r\nwith which we speak, we generally hesitate to assume towards\r\ncontemporaries, let the reader excuse me when he remembers how greatly,\r\nif it is to understand its destiny, the world needs light, even if it is\r\npartial and uncertain, on the complex struggle of human will and\r\npurpose, not yet finished, which, concentrated in the persons of four\r\nindividuals in a manner never paralleled, made them, in the first months\r\nof 1919, the microcosm of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn those parts of the Treaty with which I am here concerned, the lead\r\nwas taken by the French, in the sense that it was generally they who\r\nmade in the first instance the most definite and the most extreme\r\nproposals. This was partly a matter of tactics. When the final result is\r\nexpected to be a compromise, it is often prudent to start from an\r\nextreme position; and the French anticipated at the outset--like most\r\nother persons--a double process of compromise, first of all to suit the\r\nideas of their allies and associates, and secondly in the course of the\r\nPeace Conference proper with the Germans themselves. These tactics were\r\njustified by the event. Clemenceau gained a reputation for moderation\r\nwith his colleagues in Council by sometimes throwing over with an air of\r\nintellectual impartiality the more extreme proposals of his ministers;\r\nand much went through where the American and British critics were\r\nnaturally a little ignorant of the true point at issue, or where too\r\npersistent criticism by France's allies put them in a position which\r\nthey felt as invidious, of always appearing to take the enemy's part and\r\nto argue his case. Where, therefore, British and American interests were\r\nnot seriously involved their criticism grew slack, and some provisions\r\nwere thus passed which the French themselves did not take very\r\nseriously, and for which the eleventh-hour decision to allow no\r\ndiscussion with the Germans removed the opportunity of remedy.\r\n\r\nBut, apart from tactics, the French had a policy. Although Clemenceau\r\nmight curtly abandon the claims of a Klotz or a Loucheur, or close his\r\neyes with an air of fatigue when French interests were no longer\r\ninvolved in the discussion, he knew which points were vital, and these\r\nhe abated little. In so far as the main economic lines of the Treaty\r\nrepresent an intellectual idea, it is the idea of France and of\r\nClemenceau.\r\n\r\nClemenceau was by far the most eminent member of the Council of Four,\r\nand he had taken the measure of his colleagues. He alone both had an\r\nidea and had considered it in all its consequences. His age, his\r\ncharacter, his wit, and his appearance joined to give him objectivity\r\nand a, defined outline in an environment of confusion. One could not\r\ndespise Clemenceau or dislike him, but only take a different view as to\r\nthe nature of civilized man, or indulge, at least, a different hope.\r\n\r\nThe figure and bearing of Clemenceau are universally familiar. At the\r\nCouncil of Four he wore a square-tailed coat of very good, thick black\r\nbroadcloth, and on his hands, which were never uncovered, gray suede\r\ngloves; his boots were of thick black leather, very good, but of a\r\ncountry style, and sometimes fastened in front, curiously, by a buckle\r\ninstead of laces. His seat in the room in the President's house, where\r\nthe regular meetings of the Council of Four were held (as distinguished\r\nfrom their private and unattended conferences in a smaller chamber\r\nbelow), was on a square brocaded chair in the middle of the semicircle\r\nfacing the fireplace, with Signor Orlando on his left, the President\r\nnext by the fireplace, and the Prime Minister opposite on the other side\r\nof the fireplace on his right. He carried no papers and no portfolio,\r\nand was unattended by any personal secretary, though several French\r\nministers and officials appropriate to the particular matter in hand\r\nwould be present round him. His walk, his hand, and his voice were not\r\nlacking in vigor, but he bore nevertheless, especially after the attempt\r\nupon him, the aspect of a very old man conserving his strength for\r\nimportant occasions. He spoke seldom, leaving the initial statement of\r\nthe French case to his ministers or officials; he closed his eyes often\r\nand sat back in his chair with an impassive face of parchment, his gray\r\ngloved hands clasped in front of him. A short sentence, decisive or\r\ncynical, was generally sufficient, a question, an unqualified\r\nabandonment of his ministers, whose face would not be saved, or a\r\ndisplay of obstinacy reinforced by a few words in a piquantly delivered\r\nEnglish.[6] But speech and passion were not lacking when they were\r\nwanted, and the sudden outburst of words, often followed by a fit of\r\ndeep coughing from the chest, produced their impression rather by force\r\nand surprise than by persuasion.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently Mr. Lloyd George, after delivering a speech in English,\r\nwould, during the period of its interpretation into French, cross the\r\nhearthrug to the President to reinforce his case by some _ad hominem_\r\nargument in private conversation, or to sound the ground for a\r\ncompromise,--and this would sometimes be the signal for a general\r\nupheaval and disorder. The President's advisers would press round him, a\r\nmoment later the British experts would dribble across to learn the\r\nresult or see that all was well, and next the French would be there, a\r\nlittle suspicious lest the others were arranging something behind them,\r\nuntil all the room were on their feet and conversation was general in\r\nboth languages. My last and most vivid impression is of such a\r\nscene--the President and the Prime Minister as the center of a surging\r\nmob and a babel of sound, a welter of eager, impromptu compromises and\r\ncounter-compromises, all sound and fury signifying nothing, on what was\r\nan unreal question anyhow, the great issues of the morning's meeting\r\nforgotten and neglected; and Clemenceau silent and aloof on the\r\noutskirts--for nothing which touched the security of France was\r\nforward--throned, in his gray gloves, on the brocade chair, dry in soul\r\nand empty of hope, very old and tired, but surveying the scene with a\r\ncynical and almost impish air; and when at last silence was restored and\r\nthe company had returned to their places, it was to discover that he had\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nHe felt about France what Pericles felt of Athens--unique value in her,\r\nnothing else mattering; but his theory of politics was Bismarck's. He\r\nhad one illusion--France; and one disillusion--mankind, including\r\nFrenchmen, and his colleagues not least. His principles for the peace\r\ncan be expressed simply. In the first place, he was a foremost believer\r\nin the view of German psychology that the German understands and can\r\nunderstand nothing but intimidation, that he is without generosity or\r\nremorse in negotiation, that there is no advantage he will not take of\r\nyou, and no extent to which he will not demean himself for profit, that\r\nhe is without honor, pride, or mercy. Therefore you must never negotiate\r\nwith a German or conciliate him; you must dictate to him. On no other\r\nterms will he respect you, or will you prevent him from cheating you.\r\nBut it is doubtful how far he thought these characteristics peculiar to\r\nGermany, or whether his candid view of some other nations was\r\nfundamentally different. His philosophy had, therefore, no place for\r\n\"sentimentality\" in international relations. Nations are real things, of\r\nwhom you love one and feel for the rest indifference--or hatred. The\r\nglory of the nation you love is a desirable end,--but generally to be\r\nobtained at your neighbor's expense. The politics of power are\r\ninevitable, and there is nothing very new to learn about this war or the\r\nend it was fought for; England had destroyed, as in each preceding\r\ncentury, a trade rival; a mighty chapter had been closed in the secular\r\nstruggle between the glories of Germany and of France. Prudence required\r\nsome measure of lip service to the \"ideals\" of foolish Americans and\r\nhypocritical Englishmen; but it would be stupid to believe that there is\r\nmuch room in the world, as it really is, for such affairs as the League\r\nof Nations, or any sense in the principle of self-determination except\r\nas an ingenious formula for rearranging the balance of power in one's\r\nown interests.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are generalities. In tracing the practical details of\r\nthe Peace which he thought necessary for the power and the security of\r\nFrance, we must go back to the historical causes which had operated\r\nduring his lifetime. Before the Franco-German war the populations of\r\nFrance and Germany were approximately equal; but the coal and iron and\r\nshipping of Germany were in their infancy, and the wealth of France was\r\ngreatly superior. Even after the loss of Alsace-Lorraine there was no\r\ngreat discrepancy between the real resources of the two countries. But\r\nin the intervening period the relative position had changed completely.\r\nBy 1914 the population of Germany was nearly seventy per cent in excess\r\nof that of France; she had become one of the first manufacturing and\r\ntrading nations of the world; her technical skill and her means for the\r\nproduction of future wealth were unequaled. France on the other hand had\r\na stationary or declining population, and, relatively to others, had\r\nfallen seriously behind in wealth and in the power to produce it.\r\n\r\nIn spite, therefore, of France's victorious issue from the present\r\nstruggle (with the aid, this time, of England and America), her future\r\nposition remained precarious in the eyes of one who took the view that\r\nEuropean civil war is to be regarded as a normal, or at least a\r\nrecurrent, state of affairs for the future, and that the sort of\r\nconflicts between organized great powers which have occupied the past\r\nhundred years will also engage the next. According to this vision of the\r\nfuture, European history is to be a perpetual prize-fight, of which\r\nFrance has won this round, but of which this round is certainly not the\r\nlast. From the belief that essentially the old order does not change,\r\nbeing based on human nature which is always the same, and from a\r\nconsequent skepticism of all that class of doctrine which the League of\r\nNations stands for, the policy of France and of Clemenceau followed\r\nlogically. For a Peace of magnanimity or of fair and equal treatment,\r\nbased on such \"ideology\" as the Fourteen Points of the President, could\r\nonly have the effect of shortening the interval of Germany's recovery\r\nand hastening the day when she will once again hurl at France her\r\ngreater numbers and her superior resources and technical skill. Hence\r\nthe necessity of \"guarantees\"; and each guarantee that was taken, by\r\nincreasing irritation and thus the probability of a subsequent\r\n_Revanche_ by Germany, made necessary yet further provisions to crush.\r\nThus, as soon as this view of the world is adopted and the other\r\ndiscarded, a demand for a Carthaginian Peace is inevitable, to the full\r\nextent of the momentary power to impose it. For Clemenceau made no\r\npretense of considering himself bound by the Fourteen Points and left\r\nchiefly to others such concoctions as were necessary from time to time\r\nto save the scruples or the face of the President.\r\n\r\nSo far as possible, therefore, it was the policy of France to set the\r\nclock back and to undo what, since 1870, the progress of Germany had\r\naccomplished. By loss of territory and other measures her population was\r\nto be curtailed; but chiefly the economic system, upon which she\r\ndepended for her new strength, the vast fabric built upon iron, coal,\r\nand transport must be destroyed. If France could seize, even in part,\r\nwhat Germany was compelled to drop, the inequality of strength between\r\nthe two rivals for European hegemony might be remedied for many\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nHence sprang those cumulative provisions for the destruction of highly\r\norganized economic life which we shall examine in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nThis is the policy of an old man, whose most vivid impressions and most\r\nlively imagination are of the past and not of the future. He sees the\r\nissue in terms, of France and Germany not of humanity and of European\r\ncivilization struggling forwards to a new order. The war has bitten into\r\nhis consciousness somewhat differently from ours, and he neither expects\r\nnor hopes that we are at the threshold of a new age.\r\n\r\nIt happens, however, that it is not only an ideal question that is at\r\nissue. My purpose in this book is to show that the Carthaginian Peace is\r\nnot _practically_ right or possible. Although the school of thought from\r\nwhich it springs is aware of the economic factor, it overlooks,\r\nnevertheless, the deeper economic tendencies which are to govern the\r\nfuture. The clock cannot be set back. You cannot restore Central Europe\r\nto 1870 without setting up such strains in the European structure and\r\nletting loose such human and spiritual forces as, pushing beyond\r\nfrontiers and races, will overwhelm not only you and your \"guarantees,\"\r\nbut your institutions, and the existing order of your Society.\r\n\r\nBy what legerdemain was this policy substituted for the Fourteen Points,\r\nand how did the President come to accept it? The answer to these\r\nquestions is difficult and depends on elements of character and\r\npsychology and on the subtle influence of surroundings, which are hard\r\nto detect and harder still to describe. But, if ever the action of a\r\nsingle individual matters, the collapse of The President has been one of\r\nthe decisive moral events of history; and I must make an attempt to\r\nexplain it. What a place the President held in the hearts and hopes of\r\nthe world when he sailed to us in the _George Washington!_ What a great\r\nman came to Europe in those early days of our victory!\r\n\r\nIn November, 1918, the armies of Foch and the words of Wilson had\r\nbrought us sudden escape from what was swallowing up all we cared for.\r\nThe conditions seemed favorable beyond any expectation. The victory was\r\nso complete that fear need play no part in the settlement. The enemy\r\nhad laid down his arms in reliance on a solemn compact as to the general\r\ncharacter of the Peace, the terms of which seemed to assure a settlement\r\nof justice and magnanimity and a fair hope for a restoration of the\r\nbroken current of life. To make assurance certain the President was\r\ncoming himself to set the seal on his work.\r\n\r\nWhen President Wilson left Washington he enjoyed a prestige and a moral\r\ninfluence throughout the world unequaled in history. His bold and\r\nmeasured words carried to the peoples of Europe above and beyond the\r\nvoices of their own politicians. The enemy peoples trusted him to carry\r\nout the compact he had made with them; and the Allied peoples\r\nacknowledged him not as a victor only but almost as a prophet. In\r\naddition to this moral influence the realities of power were in his\r\nhands. The American armies were at the height of their numbers,\r\ndiscipline, and equipment. Europe was in complete dependence on the food\r\nsupplies of the United States; and financially she was even more\r\nabsolutely at their mercy. Europe not only already owed the United\r\nStates more than she could pay; but only a large measure of further\r\nassistance could save her from starvation and bankruptcy. Never had a\r\nphilosopher held such weapons wherewith to bind the princes of this\r\nworld. How the crowds of the European capitals pressed about the\r\ncarriage of the President! With what curiosity, anxiety, and hope we\r\nsought a glimpse of the features and bearing of the man of destiny who,\r\ncoming from the West, was to bring healing to the wounds of the ancient\r\nparent of his civilization and lay for us the foundations of the future.\r\n\r\nThe disillusion was so complete, that some of those who had trusted most\r\nhardly dared speak of it. Could it be true? they asked of those who\r\nreturned from Paris. Was the Treaty really as bad as it seemed? What had\r\nhappened to the President? What weakness or what misfortune had led to\r\nso extraordinary, so unlooked-for a betrayal?\r\n\r\nYet the causes were very ordinary and human. The President was not a\r\nhero or a prophet; he was not even a philosopher; but a generously\r\nintentioned man, with many of the weaknesses of other human beings, and\r\nlacking that dominating intellectual equipment which would have been\r\nnecessary to cope with the subtle and dangerous spellbinders whom a\r\ntremendous clash of forces and personalities had brought to the top as\r\ntriumphant masters in the swift game of give and take, face to face in\r\nCouncil,--a game of which he had no experience at all.\r\n\r\nWe had indeed quite a wrong idea of the President. We knew him to be\r\nsolitary and aloof, and believed him very strong-willed and obstinate.\r\nWe did not figure him as a man of detail, but the clearness with which\r\nhe had taken hold of certain main ideas would, we thought, in\r\ncombination with his tenacity, enable him to sweep through cobwebs.\r\nBesides these qualities he would have the objectivity, the cultivation,\r\nand the wide knowledge of the student. The great distinction of language\r\nwhich had marked his famous Notes seemed to indicate a man of lofty and\r\npowerful imagination. His portraits indicated a fine presence and a\r\ncommanding delivery. With all this he had attained and held with\r\nincreasing authority the first position in a country where the arts of\r\nthe politician are not neglected. All of which, without expecting the\r\nimpossible, seemed a fine combination of qualities for the matter in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nThe first impression of Mr. Wilson at close quarters was to impair some\r\nbut not all of these illusions. His head and features were finely cut\r\nand exactly like his photographs, and the muscles of his neck and the\r\ncarriage of his head were distinguished. But, like Odysseus, the\r\nPresident looked wiser when he was seated; and his hands, though capable\r\nand fairly strong, were wanting in sensitiveness and finesse. The first\r\nglance at the President suggested not only that, whatever else he might\r\nbe, his temperament was not primarily that of the student or the\r\nscholar, but that he had not much even of that culture of the world\r\nwhich marks M. Clemenceau and Mr. Balfour as exquisitely cultivated\r\ngentlemen of their class and generation. But more serious than this, he\r\nwas not only insensitive to his surroundings in the external sense, he\r\nwas not sensitive to his environment at all. What chance could such a\r\nman have against Mr. Lloyd George's unerring, almost medium-like,\r\nsensibility to every one immediately round him? To see the British Prime\r\nMinister watching the company, with six or seven senses not available to\r\nordinary men, judging character, motive, and subconscious impulse,\r\nperceiving what each was thinking and even what each was going to say\r\nnext, and compounding with telepathic instinct the argument or appeal\r\nbest suited to the vanity, weakness, or self-interest of his immediate\r\nauditor, was to realize that the poor President would be playing blind\r\nman's buff in that party. Never could a man have stepped into the parlor\r\na more perfect and predestined victim to the finished accomplishments of\r\nthe Prime Minister. The Old World was tough in wickedness anyhow; the\r\nOld World's heart of stone might blunt the sharpest blade of the bravest\r\nknight-errant. But this blind and deaf Don Quixote was entering a cavern\r\nwhere the swift and glittering blade was in the hands of the adversary.\r\n\r\nBut if the President was not the philosopher-king, what was he? After\r\nall he was a man who had spent much of his life at a University. He was\r\nby no means a business man or an ordinary party politician, but a man of\r\nforce, personality, and importance. What, then, was his temperament?\r\n\r\nThe clue once found was illuminating. The President was like a\r\nNonconformist minister, perhaps a Presbyterian. His thought and his\r\ntemperament wore essentially theological not intellectual, with all the\r\nstrength and the weakness of that manner of thought, feeling, and\r\nexpression. It is a type of which there are not now in England and\r\nScotland such magnificent specimens as formerly; but this description,\r\nnevertheless, will give the ordinary Englishman the distinctest\r\nimpression of the President.\r\n\r\nWith this picture of him in mind, we can return to the actual course of\r\nevents. The President's program for the World, as set forth in his\r\nspeeches and his Notes, had displayed a spirit and a purpose so\r\nadmirable that the last desire of his sympathizers was to criticize\r\ndetails,--the details, they felt, were quite rightly not filled in at\r\npresent, but would be in due course. It was commonly believed at the\r\ncommencement of the Paris Conference that the President had thought out,\r\nwith the aid of a large body of advisers, a comprehensive scheme not\r\nonly for the League of Nations, but for the embodiment of the Fourteen\r\nPoints in an actual Treaty of Peace. But in fact the President had\r\nthought out nothing; when it came to practice his ideas were nebulous\r\nand incomplete. He had no plan, no scheme, no constructive ideas\r\nwhatever for clothing with the flesh of life the commandments which he\r\nhad thundered from the White House. He could have preached a sermon on\r\nany of them or have addressed a stately prayer to the Almighty for their\r\nfulfilment; but he could not frame their concrete application to the\r\nactual state of Europe.\r\n\r\nHe not only had no proposals in detail, but he was in many respects,\r\nperhaps inevitably, ill-informed as to European conditions. And not only\r\nwas he ill-informed--that was true of Mr. Lloyd George also--but his\r\nmind was slow and unadaptable. The President's slowness amongst the\r\nEuropeans was noteworthy. He could not, all in a minute, take in what\r\nthe rest were saying, size up the situation with a glance, frame a\r\nreply, and meet the case by a slight change of ground; and he was\r\nliable, therefore, to defeat by the mere swiftness, apprehension, and\r\nagility of a Lloyd George. There can seldom have been a statesman of the\r\nfirst rank more incompetent than the President in the agilities of the\r\ncouncil chamber. A moment often arrives when substantial victory is\r\nyours if by some slight appearance of a concession you can save the face\r\nof the opposition or conciliate them by a restatement of your proposal\r\nhelpful to them and not injurious to anything essential to yourself. The\r\nPresident was not equipped with this simple and usual artfulness. His\r\nmind was too slow and unresourceful to be ready with _any_ alternatives.\r\nThe President was capable of digging his toes in and refusing to budge,\r\nas he did over Fiume. But he had no other mode of defense, and it needed\r\nas a rule but little manoeuvering by his opponents to prevent matters\r\nfrom coming to such a head until it was too late. By pleasantness and an\r\nappearance of conciliation, the President would be manoeuvered off his\r\nground, would miss the moment for digging his toes in, and, before he\r\nknew where he had been got to, it was too late. Besides, it is\r\nimpossible month after month in intimate and ostensibly friendly\r\nconverse between close associates, to be digging the toes in all the\r\ntime. Victory would only have been possible to one who had always a\r\nsufficiently lively apprehension of the position as a whole to reserve\r\nhis fire and know for certain the rare exact moments for decisive\r\naction. And for that the President was far too slow-minded and\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\nHe did not remedy these defects by seeking aid from the collective\r\nwisdom of his lieutenants. He had gathered round him for the economic\r\nchapters of the Treaty a very able group of business men; but they were\r\ninexperienced in public affairs, and knew (with one or two exceptions)\r\nas little of Europe as he did, and they were only called in irregularly\r\nas he might need them for a particular purpose. Thus the aloofness which\r\nhad been found effective in Washington was maintained, and the abnormal\r\nreserve of his nature did not allow near him any one who aspired to\r\nmoral equality or the continuous exercise of influence. His\r\nfellow-plenipotentiaries were dummies; and even the trusted Colonel\r\nHouse, with vastly more knowledge of men and of Europe than the\r\nPresident, from whose sensitiveness the President's dullness had gained\r\nso much, fell into the background as time went on. All this was\r\nencouraged by his colleagues on the Council of Four, who, by the\r\nbreak-up of the Council of Ten, completed the isolation which the\r\nPresident's own temperament had initiated. Thus day after day and week\r\nafter week, he allowed himself to be closeted, unsupported, unadvised,\r\nand alone, with men much sharper than himself, in situations of supreme\r\ndifficulty, where he needed for success every description of resource,\r\nfertility, and knowledge. He allowed himself to be drugged by their\r\natmosphere, to discuss on the basis of their plans and of their data,\r\nand to be led along their paths.\r\n\r\nThese and other various causes combined to produce the following\r\nsituation. The reader must remember that the processes which are here\r\ncompressed into a few pages took place slowly, gradually, insidiously,\r\nover a period of about five months.\r\n\r\nAs the President had thought nothing out, the Council was generally\r\nworking on the basis of a French or British draft. He had to take up,\r\ntherefore, a persistent attitude of obstruction, criticism, and\r\nnegation, if the draft was to become at all in line with his own ideas\r\nand purpose. If he was met on some points with apparent generosity (for\r\nthere was always a safe margin of quite preposterous suggestions which\r\nno one took seriously), it was difficult for him not to yield on others.\r\nCompromise was inevitable, and never to compromise on the essential,\r\nvery difficult. Besides, he was soon made to appear to be taking the\r\nGerman part and laid himself open to the suggestion (to which he was\r\nfoolishly and unfortunately sensitive) of being \"pro-German.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a display of much principle and dignity in the early days of the\r\nCouncil of Ten, he discovered that there were certain very important\r\npoints in the program of his French, British, or Italian colleague, as\r\nthe case might be, of which he was incapable of securing the surrender\r\nby the methods of secret diplomacy. What then was he to do in the last\r\nresort? He could let the Conference drag on an endless length by the\r\nexercise of sheer obstinacy. He could break it up and return to America\r\nin a rage with nothing settled. Or he could attempt an appeal to the\r\nworld over the heads of the Conference. These were wretched\r\nalternatives, against each of which a great deal could be said. They\r\nwere also very risky,--especially for a politician. The President's\r\nmistaken policy over the Congressional election had weakened his\r\npersonal position in his own country, and it was by no means certain\r\nthat the American public would support him in a position of\r\nintransigeancy. It would mean a campaign in which the issues would be\r\nclouded by every sort of personal and party consideration, and who could\r\nsay if right would triumph in a struggle which would certainly not be\r\ndecided on its merits? Besides, any open rupture with his colleagues\r\nwould certainly bring upon his head the blind passions of \"anti-German\"\r\nresentment with which the public of all allied countries were still\r\ninspired. They would not listen to his arguments. They would not be cool\r\nenough to treat the issue as one of international morality or of the\r\nright governance of Europe. The cry would simply be that, for various\r\nsinister and selfish reasons, the President wished \"to let the Hun off.\"\r\nThe almost unanimous voice of the French and British Press could be\r\nanticipated. Thus, if he threw down the gage publicly he might be\r\ndefeated. And if he were defeated, would not the final Peace be far\r\nworse than if he were to retain his prestige and endeavor to make it as\r\ngood as the limiting conditions of European politics would allow, him?\r\nBut above all, if he were defeated, would he not lose the League of\r\nNations? And was not this, after all, by far the most important issue\r\nfor the future happiness of the world? The Treaty would be altered and\r\nsoftened by time. Much in it which now seemed so vital would become\r\ntrifling, and much which was impracticable would for that very reason\r\nnever happen. But the League, even in an imperfect form, was permanent;\r\nit was the first commencement of a new principle in the government of\r\nthe world; Truth and Justice in international relations could not be\r\nestablished in a few months,--they must be born in due course by the\r\nslow gestation of the League. Clemenceau had been clever enough to let\r\nit be seen that he would swallow the League at a price.\r\n\r\nAt the crisis of his fortunes the President was a lonely man. Caught up\r\nin the toils of the Old World, he stood in great need of sympathy, of\r\nmoral support, of the enthusiasm of masses. But buried in the\r\nConference, stifled in the hot and poisoned atmosphere of Paris, no echo\r\nreached him from the outer world, and no throb of passion, sympathy, or\r\nencouragement from his silent constituents in all countries. He felt\r\nthat the blaze of popularity which had greeted his arrival in Europe\r\nwas already dimmed; the Paris Press jeered at him openly; his political\r\nopponents at home were taking advantage of his absence to create an\r\natmosphere against him; England was cold, critical, and unresponsive. He\r\nhad so formed his _entourage_ that he did not receive through private\r\nchannels the current of faith and enthusiasm of which the public sources\r\nseemed dammed up. He needed, but lacked, the added strength of\r\ncollective faith. The German terror still overhung us, and even the\r\nsympathetic public was very cautious; the enemy must not be encouraged,\r\nour friends must be supported, this was not the time for discord or\r\nagitations, the President must be trusted to do his best. And in this\r\ndrought the flower of the President's faith withered and dried up.\r\n\r\nThus it came to pass that the President countermanded the _George\r\nWashington_, which, in a moment of well-founded rage, he had ordered to\r\nbe in readiness to carry him from the treacherous halls of Paris back to\r\nthe seat of his authority, where he could have felt himself again. But\r\nas soon, alas, as he had taken the road of compromise, the defects,\r\nalready indicated, of his temperament and of his equipment, were fatally\r\napparent. He could take the high line; he could practise obstinacy; he\r\ncould write Notes from Sinai or Olympus; he could remain unapproachable\r\nin the White House or even in the Council of Ten and be safe. But if he\r\nonce stepped down to the intimate equality of the Four, the game was\r\nevidently up.\r\n\r\nNow it was that what I have called his theological or Presbyterian\r\ntemperament became dangerous. Having decided that some concessions were\r\nunavoidable, he might have sought by firmness and address and the use of\r\nthe financial power of the United States to secure as much as he could\r\nof the substance, even at some sacrifice of the letter. But the\r\nPresident was not capable of so clear an understanding with himself as\r\nthis implied. He was too conscientious. Although compromises were now\r\nnecessary, he remained a man of principle and the Fourteen Points a\r\ncontract absolutely binding upon him. He would do nothing that was not\r\nhonorable; he would do nothing that was not just and right; he would do\r\nnothing that was contrary to his great profession of faith. Thus,\r\nwithout any abatement of the verbal inspiration of the Fourteen Points,\r\nthey became a document for gloss and interpretation and for all the\r\nintellectual apparatus of self-deception, by which, I daresay, the\r\nPresident's forefathers had persuaded themselves that the course they\r\nthought it necessary to take was consistent with every syllable of the\r\nPentateuch.\r\n\r\nThe President's attitude to his colleagues had now become: I want to\r\nmeet you so far as I can; I see your difficulties and I should like to\r\nbe able to agree to what you propose; but I can do nothing that is not\r\njust and right, and you must first of all show me that what you want\r\ndoes really fall within the words of the pronouncements which are\r\nbinding on me. Then began the weaving of that web of sophistry and\r\nJesuitical exegesis that was finally to clothe with insincerity the\r\nlanguage and substance of the whole Treaty. The word was issued to the\r\nwitches of all Paris:\r\n\r\n    Fair is foul, and foul is fair,\r\n    Hover through the fog and filthy air.\r\n\r\nThe subtlest sophisters and most hypocritical draftsmen were set to\r\nwork, and produced many ingenious exercises which might have deceived\r\nfor more than an hour a cleverer man than the President.\r\n\r\nThus instead of saying that German-Austria is prohibited from uniting\r\nwith Germany except by leave of France (which would be inconsistent with\r\nthe principle of self-determination), the Treaty, with delicate\r\ndraftsmanship, states that \"Germany acknowledges and will respect\r\nstrictly the independence of Austria, within the frontiers which may be\r\nfixed in a Treaty between that State and the Principal Allied and\r\nAssociated Powers; she agrees that this independence shall be\r\ninalienable, except with the consent of the Council of the League of\r\nNations,\" which sounds, but is not, quite different. And who knows but\r\nthat the President forgot that another part of the Treaty provides that\r\nfor this purpose the Council of the League must be _unanimous_.\r\n\r\nInstead of giving Danzig to Poland, the Treaty establishes Danzig as a\r\n\"Free\" City, but includes this \"Free\" City within the Polish Customs\r\nfrontier, entrusts to Poland the control of the river and railway\r\nsystem, and provides that \"the Polish Government shall undertake the\r\nconduct of the foreign relations of the Free City of Danzig as well as\r\nthe diplomatic protection of citizens of that city when abroad.\"\r\n\r\nIn placing the river system of Germany under foreign control, the Treaty\r\nspeaks of declaring international those \"river systems which naturally\r\nprovide more than one State with access to the sea, with or without\r\ntranshipment from one vessel to another.\"\r\n\r\nSuch instances could be multiplied. The honest and intelligible purpose\r\nof French policy, to limit the population of Germany and weaken her\r\neconomic system, is clothed, for the President's sake, in the august\r\nlanguage of freedom and international equality.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most decisive moment, in the disintegration of the\r\nPresident's moral position and the clouding of his mind, was when at\r\nlast, to the dismay of his advisers, he allowed himself to be persuaded\r\nthat the expenditure of the Allied Governments on pensions and\r\nseparation allowances could be fairly regarded as \"damage done to the\r\ncivilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers by German\r\naggression by land, by sea, and from the air,\" in a sense in which the\r\nother expenses of the war could not be so regarded. It was a long\r\ntheological struggle in which, after the rejection of many different\r\narguments, the President finally capitulated before a masterpiece of the\r\nsophist's art.\r\n\r\nAt last the work was finished; and the President's conscience was still\r\nintact. In spite of everything, I believe that his temperament allowed\r\nhim to leave Paris a really sincere man; and it is probable that to this\r\nday he is genuinely convinced that the Treaty contains practically\r\nnothing inconsistent with his former professions.\r\n\r\nBut the work was too complete, and to this was due the last tragic\r\nepisode of the drama. The reply of Brockdorff-Rantzau inevitably took\r\nthe line that Germany had laid down her arms on the basis of certain\r\nassurances, and that the Treaty in many particulars was not consistent\r\nwith these assurances. But this was exactly what the President could not\r\nadmit; in the sweat of solitary contemplation and with prayers to God\r\nhe had done _nothing_ that was not just and right; for the President to\r\nadmit that the German reply had force in it was to destroy his\r\nself-respect and to disrupt the inner equipoise of his soul; and every\r\ninstinct of his stubborn nature rose in self-protection. In the language\r\nof medical psychology, to suggest to the President that the Treaty was\r\nan abandonment of his professions was to touch on the raw a Freudian\r\ncomplex. It was a subject intolerable to discuss, and every subconscious\r\ninstinct plotted to defeat its further exploration.\r\n\r\nThus it was that Clemenceau brought to success, what had seemed to be, a\r\nfew months before, the extraordinary and impossible proposal that the\r\nGermans should not be heard. If only the President had not been so\r\nconscientious, if only he had not concealed from himself what he had\r\nbeen doing, even at the last moment he was in, a position to have\r\nrecovered lost ground and to have achieved some very considerable\r\nsuccesses. But the President was set. His arms and legs had been spliced\r\nby the surgeons to a certain posture, and they must be broken again\r\nbefore they could be altered. To his horror, Mr. Lloyd George, desiring\r\nat the last moment all the moderation he dared, discovered that he could\r\nnot in five days persuade the President of error in what it had taken\r\nfive months to prove to him to be just and right. After all, it was\r\nharder to de-bamboozle this old Presbyterian than it had been to\r\nbamboozle him; for the former involved his belief in and respect for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThus in the last act the President stood for stubbornness and a refusal\r\nof conciliations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] He alone amongst the Four could speak and understand both\r\nlanguages, Orlando knowing only French and the Prime Minister and\r\nPresident only English; and it is of historical importance that Orlando\r\nand the President had no direct means of communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE TREATY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe thoughts which I have expressed in the second chapter were not\r\npresent to the mind of Paris. The future life of Europe was not their\r\nconcern; its means of livelihood was not their anxiety. Their\r\npreoccupations, good and bad alike, related to frontiers and\r\nnationalities, to the balance of power, to imperial aggrandizements, to\r\nthe future enfeeblement of a strong and dangerous enemy, to revenge, and\r\nto the shifting by the victors of their unbearable financial burdens on\r\nto the shoulders of the defeated.\r\n\r\nTwo rival schemes for the future polity of the world took the\r\nfield,--the Fourteen Points of the President, and the Carthaginian Peace\r\nof M. Clemenceau. Yet only one of these was entitled to take the field;\r\nfor the enemy had not surrendered unconditionally, but on agreed terms\r\nas to the general character of the Peace.\r\n\r\nThis aspect of what happened cannot, unfortunately, be passed over with\r\na word, for in the minds of many Englishmen at least it has been a\r\nsubject of very great misapprehension. Many persons believe that the\r\nArmistice Terms constituted the first Contract concluded between the\r\nAllied and Associated Powers and the German Government, and that we\r\nentered the Conference with our hands, free, except so far as these\r\nArmistice Terms might bind us. This was not the case. To make the\r\nposition plain, it is necessary briefly to review the history, of the\r\nnegotiations which began with the German Note of October 5, 1918, and\r\nconcluded with President Wilson's Note of November 5, 1918.\r\n\r\nOn October 5, 1918, the German Government addressed a brief Note to the\r\nPresident accepting the Fourteen Points and asking for Peace\r\nnegotiations. The President's reply of October 8 asked if he was to\r\nunderstand definitely that the German Government accepted \"the terms\r\nlaid down\" in Fourteen Points and in his subsequent Addresses and \"that\r\nits object in entering into discussion would be only to agree upon the\r\npractical details of their application.\" He added that the evacuation of\r\ninvaded territory must be a prior condition of an Armistice. On October\r\n12 the German Government returned an unconditional affirmative to these\r\nquestions;-\"its object in entering into discussions would be only to\r\nagree upon practical details of the application of these terms.\" On\r\nOctober 14, having received this affirmative answer, the President made\r\na further communication to make clear the points: (1) that the details\r\nof the Armistice would have to be left to the military advisers of the\r\nUnited States and the Allies, and must provide absolutely against the\r\npossibility of Germany's resuming hostilities; (2) that submarine\r\nwarfare must cease if these conversations were to continue; and (3) that\r\nhe required further guarantees of the representative character of the\r\nGovernment with which he was dealing. On October 20 Germany accepted\r\npoints (1) and (2), and pointed out, as regards (3), that she now had a\r\nConstitution and a Government dependent for its authority on the\r\nReichstag. On October 23 the President announced that, \"having received\r\nthe solemn and explicit assurance of the German Government that it\r\nunreservedly accepts the terms of peace laid down in his Address to the\r\nCongress of the United States on January 8, 1918 (the Fourteen Points),\r\nand the principles of settlement enunciated in his subsequent Addresses,\r\nparticularly the Address of September 27, and that it is ready to\r\ndiscuss the details of their application,\" he has communicated the above\r\ncorrespondence to the Governments of the Allied Powers \"with the\r\nsuggestion that, if these Governments are disposed to effect peace upon\r\nthe terms and principles indicated,\" they will ask their military\r\nadvisers to draw up Armistice Terms of such a character as to \"ensure to\r\nthe Associated Governments the unrestricted power to safeguard and\r\nenforce the details of the peace to which the German Government has\r\nagreed.\" At the end of this Note the President hinted more openly than\r\nin that of October 14 at the abdication of the Kaiser. This completes\r\nthe preliminary negotiations to which the President alone was a party,\r\nadding without the Governments of the Allied Powers.\r\n\r\nOn November 5, 1918, the President transmitted to Germany the reply he\r\nhad received from the Governments associated with him, and added that\r\nMarshal Foch had been authorized to communicate the terms of an\r\narmistice to properly accredited representatives. In this reply the\r\nAllied Governments, \"subject to the qualifications which follow, declare\r\ntheir willingness to make peace with the Government of Germany on the\r\nterms of peace laid down in the President's Address to Congress of\r\nJanuary 8, 1918, and the principles of settlement enunciated in his\r\nsubsequent Addresses.\" The qualifications in question were two in\r\nnumber. The first related to the Freedom of the Seas, as to which they\r\n\"reserved to themselves complete freedom.\" The second related to\r\nReparation and ran as follows:--\"Further, in the conditions of peace\r\nlaid down in his Address to Congress on the 8th January, 1918 the\r\nPresident declared that invaded territories must be restored as well as\r\nevacuated and made free. The Allied Governments feel that no doubt\r\nought to be allowed to exist as to what this provision implies. By it\r\nthey understand that compensation will be made by Germany for all damage\r\ndone to the civilian population of the Allies and to their property by\r\nthe aggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from the air.\"[7]\r\n\r\nThe nature of the Contract between Germany and the Allies resulting from\r\nthis exchange of documents is plain and unequivocal. The terms of the\r\npeace are to be in accordance with the Addresses of the President, and\r\nthe purpose of the Peace Conference is \"to discuss the details of their\r\napplication.\" The circumstances of the Contract were of an unusually\r\nsolemn and binding character; for one of the conditions of it was that\r\nGermany should agree to Armistice Terms which were to be such as would\r\nleave her helpless. Germany having rendered herself helpless in reliance\r\non the Contract, the honor of the Allies was peculiarly involved in\r\nfulfilling their part and, if there were ambiguities, in not using their\r\nposition to take advantage of them.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the substance of this Contract to which the Allies had\r\nbound themselves? An examination of the documents shows that, although a\r\nlarge part of the Addresses is concerned with spirit, purpose, and\r\nintention, and not with concrete solutions, and that many questions\r\nrequiring a settlement in the Peace Treaty are not touched on,\r\nnevertheless, there are certain questions which they settle definitely.\r\nIt is true that within somewhat wide limits the Allies still had a free\r\nhand. Further, it is difficult to apply on a contractual basis those\r\npassages which deal with spirit, purpose, and intention;--every man must\r\njudge for himself whether, in view of them, deception or hypocrisy has\r\nbeen practised. But there remain, as will be seen below, certain\r\nimportant issues on which the Contract is unequivocal.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Fourteen Points of January 18, 1918, the Addresses of\r\nthe President which form part of the material of the Contract are four\r\nin number,--before the Congress on February 11; at Baltimore on April 6;\r\nat Mount Vernon on July 4; and at New York on September 27, the last of\r\nthese being specially referred to in the Contract. I venture to select\r\nfrom these Addresses those engagements of substance, avoiding\r\nrepetitions, which are most relevant to the German Treaty. The parts I\r\nomit add to, rather than detract from, those I quote; but they chiefly\r\nrelate to intention, and are perhaps too vague and general to be\r\ninterpreted contractually.[8]\r\n\r\n_The Fourteen Points_.--(3). \"The removal, so far as possible, of all\r\neconomic barriers and the establishment of an equality of trade\r\nconditions among _all_ the nations consenting to the Peace and\r\nassociating themselves for its maintenance.\" (4). \"Adequate guarantees\r\n_given and taken_ that national armaments will be reduced to the lowest\r\npoint consistent with domestic safety.\" (5). \"A free, open-minded, and\r\nabsolutely impartial adjustment of all colonial claims,\" regard being\r\nhad to the interests of the populations concerned. (6), (7), (8), and\r\n(11). The evacuation and \"restoration\" of all invaded territory,\r\nespecially of Belgium. To this must be added the rider of the Allies,\r\nclaiming compensation for all damage done to civilians and their\r\nproperty by land, by sea, and from the air (quoted in full above). (8).\r\nThe righting of \"the wrong done to France by Prussia in 1871 in the\r\nmatter of Alsace-Lorraine.\" (13). An independent Poland, including \"the\r\nterritories inhabited by indisputably Polish populations\" and \"assured a\r\nfree and secure access to the sea.\" (14). The League of Nations.\r\n\r\n_Before the Congress, February 11_.--\"There shall be no annexations, _no\r\ncontributions, no punitive damages_.... Self-determination is not a\r\nmere phrase. It is an imperative principle of action which statesmen\r\nwill henceforth ignore at their peril.... Every territorial settlement\r\ninvolved in this war must be made in the interest and for the benefit of\r\nthe populations concerned, and not as a part of any mere adjustment or\r\ncompromise of claims amongst rival States.\"\r\n\r\n_New York, September 27_.--(1) \"The impartial justice meted out must\r\ninvolve no discrimination between those to whom we wish to be just and\r\nthose to whom we do not wish to be just.\" (2) \"No special or separate\r\ninterest of any single nation or any group of nations can be made the\r\nbasis of any part of the settlement which is not consistent with the\r\ncommon interest of all.\" (3) \"There can be no leagues or alliances or\r\nspecial covenants and understandings within the general and common\r\nfamily of the League of Nations.\" (4) \"There can be no special selfish\r\neconomic combinations within the League and no employment of any form of\r\neconomic boycott or exclusion, except as the power of economic penalty\r\nby exclusion from the markets of the world may be vested in the League\r\nof Nations itself as a means of discipline and control.\" (5) \"All\r\ninternational agreements and treaties of every kind must be made known\r\nin their entirety to the rest of the world.\"\r\n\r\nThis wise and magnanimous program for the world had passed on November\r\n5, 1918 beyond the region of idealism and aspiration, and had become\r\npart of a solemn contract to which all the Great Powers of the world had\r\nput their signature. But it was lost, nevertheless, in the morass of\r\nParis;--the spirit of it altogether, the letter in parts ignored and in\r\nother parts distorted.\r\n\r\nThe German observations on the draft Treaty of Peace were largely a\r\ncomparison between the terms of this understanding, on the basis of\r\nwhich the German nation had agreed to lay down its arms, and the actual\r\nprovisions of the document offered them for signature thereafter. The\r\nGerman commentators had little difficulty in showing that the draft\r\nTreaty constituted a breach of engagements and of international morality\r\ncomparable with their own offense in the invasion of Belgium.\r\nNevertheless, the German reply was not in all its parts a document fully\r\nworthy of the occasion, because in spite of the justice and importance\r\nof much of its contents, a truly broad treatment and high dignity of\r\noutlook were a little wanting, and the general effect lacks the simple\r\ntreatment, with the dispassionate objectivity of despair which the deep\r\npassions of the occasion might have evoked. The Allied governments gave\r\nit, in any case, no serious consideration, and I doubt if anything which\r\nthe German delegation could have said at that stage of the proceedings\r\nwould have much influenced the result.\r\n\r\nThe commonest virtues of the individual are often lacking in the\r\nspokesmen of nations; a statesman representing not himself but his\r\ncountry may prove, without incurring excessive blame--as history often\r\nrecords--vindictive, perfidious, and egotistic. These qualities are\r\nfamiliar in treaties imposed by victors. But the German delegation did\r\nnot succeed in exposing in burning and prophetic words the quality which\r\nchiefly distinguishes this transaction from all its historical\r\npredecessors--its insincerity.\r\n\r\nThis theme, however, must be for another pen than mine. I am mainly\r\nconcerned in what follows, not with the justice of the Treaty,--neither\r\nwith the demand for penal justice against the enemy, nor with the\r\nobligation of contractual justice on the victor,--but with its wisdom\r\nand with its consequences.\r\n\r\nI propose, therefore, in this chapter to set forth baldly the principal\r\neconomic provisions of the Treaty, reserving, however, for the next my\r\ncomments on the Reparation Chapter and on Germany's capacity to meet the\r\npayments there demanded from her.\r\n\r\nThe German economic system as it existed before the war depended on\r\nthree main factors: I. Overseas commerce as represented by her\r\nmercantile marine, her colonies, her foreign investments, her exports,\r\nand the overseas connections of her merchants; II. The exploitation of\r\nher coal and iron and the industries built upon them; III. Her transport\r\nand tariff system. Of these the first, while not the least important,\r\nwas certainly the most vulnerable. The Treaty aims at the systematic\r\ndestruction of all three, but principally of the first two.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n(1) Germany has ceded to the Allies _all_ the vessels of her mercantile\r\nmarine exceeding 1600 tons gross, half the vessels between 1000 tons and\r\n1600 tons, and one quarter of her trawlers and other fishing boats.[9]\r\nThe cession is comprehensive, including not only vessels flying the\r\nGerman flag, but also all vessels owned by Germans but flying other\r\nflags, and all vessels under construction as well as those afloat.[10]\r\nFurther, Germany undertakes, if required, to build for the Allies such\r\ntypes of ships as they may specify up to 200,000 tons[11] annually for\r\nfive years, the value of these ships being credited to Germany against\r\nwhat is due from her for Reparation.[12]\r\n\r\nThus the German mercantile marine is swept from the seas and cannot be\r\nrestored for many years to come on a scale adequate to meet the\r\nrequirements of her own commerce. For the present, no lines will run\r\nfrom Hamburg, except such as foreign nations may find it worth while to\r\nestablish out of their surplus tonnage. Germany will have to pay to\r\nforeigners for the carriage of her trade such charges as they may be\r\nable to exact, and will receive only such conveniences as it may suit\r\nthem to give her. The prosperity of German ports and commerce can only\r\nrevive, it would seem, in proportion as she succeeds in bringing under\r\nher effective influence the merchant marines of Scandinavia and of\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\n(2) Germany has ceded to the Allies \"all her rights and titles over her\r\noversea possessions.\"[13] This cession not only applies to sovereignty\r\nbut extends on unfavorable terms to Government property, all of which,\r\nincluding railways, must be surrendered without payment, while, on the\r\nother hand, the German Government remains liable for any debt which may\r\nhave been incurred for the purchase or construction of this property, or\r\nfor the development of the colonies generally.[14]\r\n\r\nIn distinction from the practice ruling in the case of most similar\r\ncessions in recent history, the property and persons of private German\r\nnationals, as distinct from their Government, are also injuriously\r\naffected. The Allied Government exercising authority in any former\r\nGerman colony \"may make such provisions as it thinks fit with reference\r\nto the repatriation from them of German nationals and to the conditions\r\nupon which German subjects of European origin shall, or shall not, be\r\nallowed to reside, hold property, trade or exercise a profession in\r\nthem.\"[15] All contracts and agreements in favor of German nationals for\r\nthe construction or exploitation of public works lapse to the Allied\r\nGovernments as part of the payment due for Reparation.\r\n\r\nBut these terms are unimportant compared with the more comprehensive\r\nprovision by which \"the Allied and Associated Powers reserve the right\r\nto retain and liquidate _all_ property, rights, and interests belonging\r\nat the date of the coming into force of the present Treaty to German\r\nnationals, or companies controlled by them,\" within the former German\r\ncolonies.[16] This wholesale expropriation of private property is to\r\ntake place without the Allies affording any compensation to the\r\nindividuals expropriated, and the proceeds will be employed, first, to\r\nmeet private debts due to Allied nationals from any German nationals,\r\nand second, to meet claims due from Austrian, Hungarian, Bulgarian, or\r\nTurkish nationals. Any balance may either be returned by the liquidating\r\nPower direct to Germany, or retained by them. If retained, the proceeds\r\nmust be transferred to the Reparation Commission for Germany's credit in\r\nthe Reparation account.[17]\r\n\r\nIn short, not only are German sovereignty and German influence\r\nextirpated from the whole of her former oversea possessions, but the\r\npersons and property of her nationals resident or owning property in\r\nthose parts are deprived of legal status and legal security.\r\n\r\n(3) The provisions just outlined in regard to the private property of\r\nGermans in the ex-German colonies apply equally to private German\r\nproperty in Alsace-Lorraine, except in so far as the French Government\r\nmay choose to grant exceptions.[18] This is of much greater practical\r\nimportance than the similar expropriation overseas because of the far\r\nhigher value of the property involved and the closer interconnection,\r\nresulting from the great development of the mineral wealth of these\r\nprovinces since 1871, of German economic interests there with those in\r\nGermany itself. Alsace-Lorraine has been part of the German Empire for\r\nnearly fifty years--a considerable majority of its population is German\r\nspeaking--and it has been the scene of some of Germany's most important\r\neconomic enterprises. Nevertheless, the property of those Germans who\r\nreside there, or who have invested in its industries, is now entirely at\r\nthe disposal of the French Government without compensation, except in so\r\nfar as the German Government itself may choose to afford it. The French\r\nGovernment is entitled to expropriate without compensation the personal\r\nproperty of private German citizens and German companies resident or\r\nsituated within Alsace-Lorraine, the proceeds being credited in part\r\nsatisfaction of various French claims. The severity of this provision is\r\nonly mitigated to the extent that the French Government may expressly\r\npermit German nationals to continue to reside, in which case the above\r\nprovision is not applicable. Government, State, and Municipal property,\r\non the other hand, is to be ceded to France without any credit being\r\ngiven for it. This includes the railway system of the two provinces,\r\ntogether with its rolling-stock.[19] But while the property is taken\r\nover, liabilities contracted in respect of it in the form of public\r\ndebts of any kind remain the liability of Germany.[20] The provinces\r\nalso return to French sovereignty free and quit of their share of German\r\nwar or pre-war dead-weight debt; nor does Germany receive a credit on\r\nthis account in respect of Reparation.\r\n\r\n(4) The expropriation of German private property is not limited,\r\nhowever, to the ex-German colonies and Alsace-Lorraine. The treatment of\r\nsuch property forms, indeed, a very significant and material section of\r\nthe Treaty, which has not received as much attention as it merits,\r\nalthough it was the subject of exceptionally violent objection on the\r\npart of the German delegates at Versailles. So far as I know, there is\r\nno precedent in any peace treaty of recent history for the treatment of\r\nprivate property set forth below, and the German representatives urged\r\nthat the precedent now established strikes a dangerous and immoral blow\r\nat the security of private property everywhere. This is an exaggeration,\r\nand the sharp distinction, approved by custom and convention during the\r\npast two centuries, between the property and rights of a State and the\r\nproperty and rights of its nationals is an artificial one, which is\r\nbeing rapidly put out of date by many other influences than the Peace\r\nTreaty, and is inappropriate to modern socialistic conceptions of the\r\nrelations between the State and its citizens. It is true, however, that\r\nthe Treaty strikes a destructive blow at a conception which lies at the\r\nroot of much of so-called international law, as this has been expounded\r\nhitherto.\r\n\r\nThe principal provisions relating to the expropriation of German private\r\nproperty situated outside the frontiers of Germany, as these are now\r\ndetermined, are overlapping in their incidence, and the more drastic\r\nwould seem in some cases to render the others unnecessary. Generally\r\nspeaking, however, the more drastic and extensive provisions are not so\r\nprecisely framed as those of more particular and limited application.\r\nThey are as follows:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) The Allies \"reserve the right to retain and liquidate all\r\nproperty, rights and interests belonging at the date of the coming into\r\nforce of the present Treaty to German nationals, or companies controlled\r\nby them, within their territories, colonies, possessions and\r\nprotectorates, including territories ceded to them by the present\r\nTreaty.\"[21]\r\n\r\nThis is the extended version of the provision which has been discussed\r\nalready in the case of the colonies and of Alsace-Lorraine. The value of\r\nthe property so expropriated will be applied, in the first instance, to\r\nthe satisfaction of private debts due from Germany to the nationals of\r\nthe Allied Government within whose jurisdiction the liquidation takes\r\nplace, and, second, to the satisfaction of claims arising out of the\r\nacts of Germany's former allies. Any balance, if the liquidating\r\nGovernment elects to retain it, must be credited in the Reparation\r\naccount.[22] It is, however, a point of considerable importance that the\r\nliquidating Government is not compelled to transfer the balance to the\r\nReparation Commission, but can, if it so decides, return the proceeds\r\ndirect to Germany. For this will enable the United States, if they so\r\nwish, to utilize the very large balances, in the hands of their\r\nenemy-property custodian, to pay for the provisioning of Germany,\r\nwithout regard to the views of the Reparation Commission.\r\n\r\nThese provisions had their origin in the scheme for the mutual\r\nsettlement of enemy debts by means of a Clearing House. Under this\r\nproposal it was hoped to avoid much trouble and litigation by making\r\neach of the Governments lately at war responsible for the collection of\r\nprivate _debts_ due from its nationals to the nationals of any of the\r\nother Governments (the normal process of collection having been\r\nsuspended by reason of the war), and for the distribution of the funds\r\nso collected to those of its nationals who had _claims_ against the\r\nnationals of the other Governments, any final balance either way being\r\nsettled in cash. Such a scheme could have been completely bilateral and\r\nreciprocal. And so in part it is, the scheme being mainly reciprocal as\r\nregards the collection of commercial debts. But the completeness of\r\ntheir victory permitted the Allied Governments to introduce in their own\r\nfavor many divergencies from reciprocity, of which the following are the\r\nchief: Whereas the property of Allied nationals within German\r\njurisdiction reverts under the Treaty to Allied ownership on the\r\nconclusion of Peace, the property of Germans within Allied jurisdiction\r\nis to be retained and liquidated as described above, with the result\r\nthat the whole of German property over a large part of the world can be\r\nexpropriated, and the large properties now within the custody of Public\r\nTrustees and similar officials in the Allied countries may be retained\r\npermanently. In the second place, such German assets are chargeable, not\r\nonly with the liabilities of Germans, but also, if they run to it, with\r\n\"payment of the amounts due in respect of claims by the nationals of\r\nsuch Allied or Associated Power with regard to their property, rights,\r\nand interests in the territory of other Enemy Powers,\" as, for example,\r\nTurkey, Bulgaria, and Austria.[23] This is a remarkable provision,\r\nwhich is naturally non-reciprocal. In the third place, any final balance\r\ndue to Germany on private account need not be paid over, but can be held\r\nagainst the various liabilities of the German Government.[24] The\r\neffective operation of these Articles is guaranteed by the delivery of\r\ndeeds, titles, and information.[25] In the fourth place, pre-war\r\ncontracts between Allied and German nationals may be canceled or revived\r\nat the option of the former, so that all such contracts which are in\r\nGermany's favor will be canceled, while, on the other hand, she will be\r\ncompelled to fulfil those which are to her disadvantage.\r\n\r\n(_b_) So far we have been concerned with German property within Allied\r\njurisdiction. The next provision is aimed at the elimination of German\r\ninterests in the territory of her neighbors and former allies, and of\r\ncertain other countries. Under Article 260 of the Financial Clauses it\r\nis provided that the Reparation Commission may, within one year of the\r\ncoming into force of the Treaty, demand that the German Government\r\nexpropriate its nationals and deliver to the Reparation Commission \"any\r\nrights and interests of German nationals in any public utility\r\nundertaking or in any concession[26] operating in Russia, China, Turkey,\r\nAustria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, or in the possessions or dependencies of\r\nthese States, or in any territory formerly belonging to Germany or her\r\nallies, to be ceded by Germany or her allies to any Power or to be\r\nadministered by a Mandatory under the present Treaty.\" This is a\r\ncomprehensive description, overlapping in part the provisions dealt with\r\nunder (_a_) above, but including, it should be noted, the new States and\r\nterritories carved out of the former Russian, Austro-Hungarian, and\r\nTurkish Empires. Thus Germany's influence is eliminated and her capital\r\nconfiscated in all those neighboring countries to which she might\r\nnaturally look for her future livelihood, and for an outlet for her\r\nenergy, enterprise, and technical skill.\r\n\r\nThe execution of this program in detail will throw on the Reparation\r\nCommission a peculiar task, as it will become possessor of a great\r\nnumber of rights and interests over a vast territory owing dubious\r\nobedience, disordered by war, disruption, and Bolshevism. The division\r\nof the spoils between the victors will also provide employment for a\r\npowerful office, whose doorsteps the greedy adventurers and jealous\r\nconcession-hunters of twenty or thirty nations will crowd and defile.\r\n\r\nLest the Reparation Commission fail by ignorance to exercise its rights\r\nto the full, it is further provided that the German Government shall\r\ncommunicate to it within six months of the Treaty's coming into force a\r\nlist of all the rights and interests in question, \"whether already\r\ngranted, contingent or not yet exercised,\" and any which are not so\r\ncommunicated within this period will automatically lapse in favor of the\r\nAllied Governments.[27] How far an edict of this character can be made\r\nbinding on a German national, whose person and property lie outside the\r\njurisdiction of his own Government, is an unsettled question; but all\r\nthe countries specified in the above list are open to pressure by the\r\nAllied authorities, whether by the imposition of an appropriate Treaty\r\nclause or otherwise.\r\n\r\n(_c_) There remains a third provision more sweeping than either of the\r\nabove, neither of which affects German interests in _neutral_\r\ncountries. The Reparation Commission is empowered up to May 1, 1921, to\r\ndemand payment up to $5,000,000,000 _in such manner as they may fix_,\r\n\"whether in gold, commodities, ships, securities or otherwise.\"[28] This\r\nprovision has the effect of intrusting to the Reparation Commission for\r\nthe period in question dictatorial powers over all German property of\r\nevery description whatever. They can, under this Article, point to any\r\nspecific business, enterprise, or property, whether within or outside\r\nGermany, and demand its surrender; and their authority would appear to\r\nextend not only to property existing at the date of the Peace, but also\r\nto any which may be created or acquired at any time in the course of the\r\nnext eighteen months. For example, they could pick out--as presumably\r\nthey will as soon as they are established--the fine and powerful German\r\nenterprise in South America known as the _Deutsche Ueberseeische\r\nElektrizit‰tsgesellschaft_ (the D.U.E.G.), and dispose of it to Allied\r\ninterests. The clause is unequivocal and all-embracing. It is worth\r\nwhile to note in passing that it introduces a quite novel principle in\r\nthe collection of indemnities. Hitherto, a sum has been fixed, and the\r\nnation mulcted has been left free to devise and select for itself the\r\nmeans of payment. But in this case the payees can (for a certain\r\nperiod) not only demand a certain sum but specify the particular kind of\r\nproperty in which payment is to be effected. Thus the powers of the\r\nReparation Commission, with which I deal more particularly in the next\r\nchapter, can be employed to destroy Germany's commercial and economic\r\norganization as well as to exact payment.\r\n\r\nThe cumulative effect of (_a_), (_b_), and (_c_) (as well as of certain\r\nother minor provisions on which I have not thought it necessary to\r\nenlarge) is to deprive Germany (or rather to empower the Allies so to\r\ndeprive her at their will--it is not yet accomplished) of everything she\r\npossesses outside her own frontiers as laid down in the Treaty. Not only\r\nare her oversea investments taken and her connections destroyed, but the\r\nsame process of extirpation is applied in the territories of her former\r\nallies and of her immediate neighbors by land.\r\n\r\n(5) Lest by some oversight the above provisions should overlook any\r\npossible contingencies, certain other Articles appear in the Treaty,\r\nwhich probably do not add very much in practical effect to those already\r\ndescribed, but which deserve brief mention as showing the spirit of\r\ncompleteness in which the victorious Powers entered upon the economic\r\nsubjection of their defeated enemy.\r\n\r\nFirst of all there is a general clause of barrer and renunciation: \"In\r\nterritory outside her European frontiers as fixed by the present Treaty,\r\nGermany renounces all rights, titles and privileges whatever in or over\r\nterritory which belonged to her or to her allies, and all rights, titles\r\nand privileges whatever their origin which she held as against the\r\nAllied and Associated Powers....\"[29]\r\n\r\nThere follow certain more particular provisions. Germany renounces all\r\nrights and privileges she may have acquired in China.[30] There are\r\nsimilar provisions for Siam,[31] for Liberia,[32] for Morocco,[33] and\r\nfor Egypt.[34] In the case of Egypt not only are special privileges\r\nrenounced, but by Article 150 ordinary liberties are withdrawn, the\r\nEgyptian Government being accorded \"complete liberty of action in\r\nregulating the status of German nationals and the conditions under which\r\nthey may establish themselves in Egypt.\"\r\n\r\nBy Article 258 Germany renounces her right to any participation in any\r\nfinancial or economic organizations of an international character\r\n\"operating in any of the Allied or Associated States, or in Austria,\r\nHungary, Bulgaria or Turkey, or in the dependencies of these States, or\r\nin the former Russian Empire.\"\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, only those pre-war treaties and conventions are\r\nrevived which it suits the Allied Governments to revive, and those in\r\nGermany's favor may be allowed to lapse.[35]\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that none of these provisions are of any real\r\nimportance, as compared with those described previously. They represent\r\nthe logical completion of Germany's outlawry and economic subjection to\r\nthe convenience of the Allies; but they do not add substantially to her\r\neffective disabilities.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe provisions relating to coal and iron are more important in respect\r\nof their ultimate consequences on Germany's internal industrial economy\r\nthan for the money value immediately involved. The German Empire has\r\nbeen built more truly on coal and iron than on blood and iron. The\r\nskilled exploitation of the great coalfields of the Ruhr, Upper Silesia,\r\nand the Saar, alone made possible the development of the steel,\r\nchemical, and electrical industries which established her as the first\r\nindustrial nation of continental Europe. One-third of Germany's\r\npopulation lives in towns of more than 20,000 inhabitants, an industrial\r\nconcentration which is only possible on a foundation of coal and iron.\r\nIn striking, therefore, at her coal supply, the French politicians were\r\nnot mistaking their target. It is only the extreme immoderation, and\r\nindeed technical impossibility, of the Treaty's demands which may save\r\nthe situation in the long-run.\r\n\r\n(1) The Treaty strikes at Germany's coal supply in four ways:--\r\n\r\n(i.) \"As compensation for the destruction of the coal-mines in the north\r\nof France, and as part payment towards the total reparation due from\r\nGermany for the damage resulting from the war, Germany cedes to France\r\nin full and absolute possession, with exclusive rights of exploitation,\r\nunencumbered, and free from all debts and charges of any kind, the\r\ncoal-mines situated in the Saar Basin.\"[36] While the administration of\r\nthis district is vested for fifteen years in the League of Nations, it\r\nis to be observed that the mines are ceded to France absolutely. Fifteen\r\nyears hence the population of the district will be called upon to\r\nindicate by plebiscite their desires as to the future sovereignty of the\r\nterritory; and, in the event of their electing for union with Germany,\r\nGermany is to be entitled to repurchase the mines at a price payable in\r\ngold.[37]\r\n\r\nThe judgment of the world has already recognized the transaction of the\r\nSaar as an act of spoliation and insincerity. So far as compensation for\r\nthe destruction of French coal-mines is concerned, this is provided for,\r\nas we shall see in a moment, elsewhere in the Treaty. \"There is no\r\nindustrial region in Germany,\" the German representatives have said\r\nwithout contradiction, \"the population of which is so permanent, so\r\nhomogeneous, and so little complex as that of the Saar district. Among\r\nmore than 650,000 inhabitants, there were in 1918 less than 100 French.\r\nThe Saar district has been German for more than 1,000 years. Temporary\r\noccupation as a result of warlike operations on the part of the French\r\nalways terminated in a short time in the restoration of the country upon\r\nthe conclusion of peace. During a period of 1048 years France has\r\npossessed the country for not quite 68 years in all. When, on the\r\noccasion of the first Treaty of Paris in 1814, a small portion of the\r\nterritory now coveted was retained for France, the population raised the\r\nmost energetic opposition and demanded 'reunion with their German\r\nfatherland,' to which they were 'related by language, customs, and\r\nreligion.' After an occupation of one year and a quarter, this desire\r\nwas taken into account in the second Treaty of Paris in 1815. Since then\r\nthe country has remained uninterruptedly attached to Germany, and owes\r\nits economic development to that connection.\"\r\n\r\nThe French wanted the coal for the purpose of working the ironfields of\r\nLorraine, and in the spirit of Bismarck they have taken it. Not\r\nprecedent, but the verbal professions of the Allies, have rendered it\r\nindefensible.[38]\r\n\r\n(ii.) Upper Silesia, a district without large towns, in which, however,\r\nlies one of the major coalfields of Germany with a production of about\r\n23 per cent of the total German output of hard coal, is, subject to a\r\nplebiscite,[39] to be ceded to Poland. Upper Silesia was never part of\r\nhistoric Poland; but its population is mixed Polish, German, and\r\nCzecho-Slovakian, the precise proportions of which are disputed.[40]\r\nEconomically it is intensely German; the industries of Eastern Germany\r\ndepend upon it for their coal; and its loss would be a destructive blow\r\nat the economic structure of the German State.[41]\r\n\r\nWith the loss of the fields of Upper Silesia and the Saar, the coal\r\nsupplies of Germany are diminished by not far short of one-third.\r\n\r\n(iii.) Out of the coal that remains to her, Germany is obliged to make\r\ngood year by year the estimated loss which France has incurred by the\r\ndestruction and damage of war in the coalfields of her northern\r\nProvinces. In para. 2 of Annex V. to the Reparation Chapter, \"Germany\r\nundertakes to deliver to France annually, for a period not exceeding ten\r\nyears, an amount of coal equal to the difference between the annual\r\nproduction before the war of the coal-mines of the Nord and Pas de\r\nCalais, destroyed as a result of the war, and the production of the\r\nmines of the same area during the year in question: such delivery not to\r\nexceed 20,000,000 tons in any one year of the first five years, and\r\n8,000,000 tons in any one year of the succeeding five years.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a reasonable provision if it stood by itself, and one which\r\nGermany should be able to fulfil if she were left her other resources to\r\ndo it with.\r\n\r\n(iv.) The final provision relating to coal is part of the general scheme\r\nof the Reparation Chapter by which the sums due for Reparation are to be\r\npartly paid in kind instead of in cash. As a part of the payment due for\r\nReparation, Germany is to make the following deliveries of coal or\r\nequivalent in coke (the deliveries to France being wholly additional to\r\nthe amounts available by the cession of the Saar or in compensation for\r\ndestruction in Northern France):--\r\n\r\n(i.) To France 7,000,000 tons annually for ten years;[42]\r\n\r\n(ii.) To Belgium 8,000,000 tons annually for ten years;\r\n\r\n(iii.) To Italy an annual quantity, rising by annual increments from\r\n4,500,000 tons in 1919-1920 to 8,500,000 tons in each of the six years,\r\n1923-1924 to 1928-1929;\r\n\r\n(iv.) To Luxemburg, if required, a quantity of coal equal to the\r\npre-war annual consumption of German coal in Luxemburg.\r\n\r\nThis amounts in all to an annual average of about 25,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese figures have to be examined in relation to Germany's probable\r\noutput. The maximum pre-war figure was reached in 1913 with a total of\r\n191,500,000 tons. Of this, 19,000,000 tons were consumed at the mines,\r\nand on balance (_i.e._ exports less imports) 33,500,000 tons were\r\nexported, leaving 139,000,000 tons for domestic consumption. It is\r\nestimated that this total was employed as follows:--\r\n\r\n    Railways                      18,000,000 tons.\r\n    Gas, water, and electricity   12,500,000  \"\r\n    Bunkers                        6,500,000  \"\r\n    House-fuel, small industry\r\n      and agriculture             24,000,000  \"\r\n    Industry                      78,000,000  \"\r\n                                 -----------\r\n                                 139,000,000  \"\r\n\r\nThe diminution of production due to loss of territory is:--\r\n\r\n    Alsace-Lorraine                3,800,000 tons.\r\n    Saar Basin                    13,200,000  \"\r\n    Upper Silesia                 43,800,000  \"\r\n                                 -----------\r\n                                  60,800,000  \"\r\n\r\nThere would remain, therefore, on the basis of the 1913 output,\r\n130,700,000 tons, or, deducting consumption at the mines themselves,\r\n(say) 118,000,000 tons. For some years there must be sent out of this\r\nsupply upwards of 20,000,000 tons to France as compensation for damage\r\ndone to French mines, and 25,000,000 tons to France, Belgium, Italy, and\r\nLuxemburg;[43] as the former figure is a maximum, and the latter figure\r\nis to be slightly less in the earliest years, we may take the total\r\nexport to Allied countries which Germany has undertaken to provide as\r\n40,000,000 tons, leaving, on the above basis, 78,000,000 tons for her\r\nown use as against a pre-war consumption of 139,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\nThis comparison, however, requires substantial modification to make it\r\naccurate. On the one hand, it is certain that the figures of pre-war\r\noutput cannot be relied on as a basis of present output. During 1918 the\r\nproduction was 161,500,000 tons as compared with 191,500,000 tons in\r\n1913; and during the first half of 1919 it was less than 50,000,000\r\ntons, exclusive of Alsace-Lorraine and the Saar but including Upper\r\nSilesia, corresponding to an annual production of about 100,000,000\r\ntons.[44] The causes of so low an output were in part temporary and\r\nexceptional but the German authorities agree, and have not been\r\nconfuted, that some of them are bound to persist for some time to come.\r\nIn part they are the same as elsewhere; the daily shift has been\r\nshortened from 8-1/2 to 7 hours, and it is improbable that the powers of\r\nthe Central Government will be adequate to restore them to their former\r\nfigure. But in addition, the mining plant is in bad condition (due to\r\nthe lack of certain essential materials during the blockade), the\r\nphysical efficiency of the men is greatly impaired by malnutrition\r\n(which cannot be cured if a tithe of the reparation demands are to be\r\nsatisfied,--the standard of life will have rather to be lowered), and\r\nthe casualties of the war have diminished the numbers of efficient\r\nminers. The analogy of English conditions is sufficient by itself to\r\ntell us that a pre-war level of output cannot be expected in Germany.\r\nGerman authorities put the loss of output at somewhat above 30 per\r\ncent, divided about equally between the shortening of the shift and the\r\nother economic influences. This figure appears on general grounds to be\r\nplausible, but I have not the knowledge to endorse or to criticize it.\r\n\r\nThe pre-war figure of 118,000,000 tons net (_i.e._ after allowing for\r\nloss of territory and consumption at the mines) is likely to fall,\r\ntherefore, at least as low as to 100,000,000[45] tons, having regard to\r\nthe above factors. If 40,000,000 tons of this are to be exported to the\r\nAllies, there remain 60,000,000 tons for Germany herself to meet her own\r\ndomestic consumption. Demand as well as supply will be diminished by\r\nloss of territory, but at the most extravagant estimate this could not\r\nbe put above 29,000,000 tons.[46] Our hypothetical calculations,\r\ntherefore, leave us with post-war German domestic requirements, on the\r\nbasis of a pre-war efficiency of railways and industry, of 110,000,000\r\ntons against an output not exceeding 100,000,000 tons, of which\r\n40,000,000 tons are mortgaged to the Allies.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the subject has led me into a somewhat lengthy\r\nstatistical analysis. It is evident that too much significance must not\r\nbe attached to the precise figures arrived at, which are hypothetical\r\nand dubious.[47] But the general character of the facts presents itself\r\nirresistibly. Allowing for the loss of territory and the loss of\r\nefficiency, Germany cannot export coal in the near future (and will even\r\nbe dependent on her Treaty rights to purchase in Upper Silesia), if she\r\nis to continue as an industrial nation. Every million tons she is forced\r\nto export must be at the expense of closing down an industry. With\r\nresults to be considered later this within certain limits is _possible_.\r\nBut it is evident that Germany cannot and will not furnish the Allies\r\nwith a contribution of 40,000,000 tons annually. Those Allied Ministers,\r\nwho have told their peoples that she can, have certainly deceived them\r\nfor the sake of allaying for the moment the misgivings of the European\r\npeoples as to the path along which they are being led.\r\n\r\nThe presence of these illusory provisions (amongst others) in the\r\nclauses of the Treaty of Peace is especially charged with danger for\r\nthe future. The more extravagant expectations as to Reparation\r\nreceipts, by which Finance Ministers have deceived their publics, will\r\nbe heard of no more when they have served their immediate purpose of\r\npostponing the hour of taxation and retrenchment. But the coal clauses\r\nwill not be lost sight of so easily,--for the reason that it will be\r\nabsolutely vital in the interests of France and Italy that these\r\ncountries should do everything in their power to exact their bond. As a\r\nresult of the diminished output due to German destruction in France, of\r\nthe diminished output of mines in the United Kingdom and elsewhere, and\r\nof many secondary causes, such as the breakdown of transport and of\r\norganization and the inefficiency of new governments, the coal position\r\nof all Europe is nearly desperate;[48] and France and Italy, entering\r\nthe scramble with certain Treaty rights, will not lightly surrender\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs is generally the case in real dilemmas, the French and Italian case\r\nwill possess great force, indeed unanswerable force from a certain point\r\nof view. The position will be truly represented as a question between\r\nGerman industry on the one hand and French and Italian industry on the\r\nother. It may be admitted that the surrender of the coal will destroy\r\nGerman industry, but it may be equally true that its non-surrender will\r\njeopardize French and Italian industry. In such a case must not the\r\nvictors with their Treaty rights prevail, especially when much of the\r\ndamage has been ultimately due to the wicked acts of those who are now\r\ndefeated? Yet if these feelings and these rights are allowed to prevail\r\nbeyond what wisdom would recommend, the reactions on the social and\r\neconomic life of Central Europe will be far too strong to be confined\r\nwithin their original limits.\r\n\r\nBut this is not yet the whole problem. If France and Italy are to make\r\ngood their own deficiencies in coal from the output of Germany, then\r\nNorthern Europe, Switzerland, and Austria, which previously drew their\r\ncoal in large part from Germany's exportable surplus, must be starved of\r\ntheir supplies. Before the war 13,600,000 tons of Germany's coal exports\r\nwent to Austria-Hungary. Inasmuch as nearly all the coalfields of the\r\nformer Empire lie outside what is now German-Austria, the industrial\r\nruin of this latter state, if she cannot obtain coal from Germany, will\r\nbe complete. The case of Germany's neutral neighbors, who were formerly\r\nsupplied in part from Great Britain but in large part from Germany,\r\nwill be hardly less serious. They will go to great lengths in the\r\ndirection of making their own supplies to Germany of materials which are\r\nessential to her, conditional on these being paid for in coal. Indeed\r\nthey are already doing so.[49] With the breakdown of money economy the\r\npractice of international barter is becoming prevalent. Nowadays money\r\nin Central and South-Eastern Europe is seldom a true measure of value in\r\nexchange, and will not necessarily buy anything, with the consequence\r\nthat one country, possessing a commodity essential to the needs of\r\nanother, sells it not for cash but only against a reciprocal engagement\r\non the part of the latter country to furnish in return some article not\r\nless necessary to the former. This is an extraordinary complication as\r\ncompared with the former almost perfect simplicity of international\r\ntrade. But in the no less extraordinary conditions of to-day's industry\r\nit is not without advantages as a means of stimulating production. The\r\nbutter-shifts of the Ruhr[50] show how far modern Europe has\r\nretrograded in the direction of barter, and afford a picturesque\r\nillustration of the low economic organization to which the breakdown of\r\ncurrency and free exchange between individuals and nations is quickly\r\nleading us. But they may produce the coal where other devices would\r\nfail.[51]\r\n\r\nYet if Germany can find coal for the neighboring neutrals, France and\r\nItaly may loudly claim that in this case she can and must keep her\r\ntreaty obligations. In this there will be a great show of justice, and\r\nit will be difficult to weigh against such claims the possible facts\r\nthat, while German miners will work for butter, there is no available\r\nmeans of compelling them to get coal, the sale of which will bring in\r\nnothing, and that if Germany has no coal to send to her neighbors she\r\nmay fail to secure imports essential to her economic existence.\r\n\r\nIf the distribution of the European coal supplies is to be a scramble in\r\nwhich France is satisfied first, Italy next, and every one else takes\r\ntheir chance, the industrial future of Europe is black and the prospects\r\nof revolution very good. It is a case where particular interests and\r\nparticular claims, however well founded in sentiment or in justice,\r\nmust yield to sovereign expediency. If there is any approximate truth in\r\nMr. Hoover's calculation that the coal output of Europe has fallen by\r\none-third, a situation confronts us where distribution must be effected\r\nwith even-handed impartiality in accordance with need, and no incentive\r\ncan be neglected towards increased production and economical methods of\r\ntransport. The establishment by the Supreme Council of the Allies in\r\nAugust, 1919, of a European Coal Commission, consisting of delegates\r\nfrom Great Britain, France, Italy, Belgium, Poland, and Czecho-Slovakia\r\nwas a wise measure which, properly employed and extended, may prove of\r\ngreat assistance. But I reserve constructive proposals for Chapter VII.\r\nHere I am only concerned with tracing the consequences, _per\r\nimpossibile_, of carrying out the Treaty _au pied de lettre_.[52]\r\n\r\n(2) The provisions relating to iron-ore require less detailed attention,\r\nthough their effects are destructive. They require less attention,\r\nbecause they are in large measure inevitable. Almost exactly 75 per cent\r\nof the iron-ore raised in Germany in 1913 came from Alsace-Lorraine.[53]\r\nIn this the chief importance of the stolen provinces lay.\r\n\r\nThere is no question but that Germany must lose these ore-fields. The\r\nonly question is how far she is to be allowed facilities for purchasing\r\ntheir produce. The German Delegation made strong efforts to secure the\r\ninclusion of a provision by which coal and coke to be furnished by them\r\nto France should be given in exchange for _minette_ from Lorraine. But\r\nthey secured no such stipulation, and the matter remains at France's\r\noption.\r\n\r\nThe motives which will govern France's eventual policy are not entirely\r\nconcordant. While Lorraine comprised 75 per cent of Germany's iron-ore,\r\nonly 25 per cent of the blast furnaces lay within Lorraine and the Saar\r\nbasin together, a large proportion of the ore being carried into Germany\r\nproper. Approximately the same proportion of Germany's iron and steel\r\nfoundries, namely 25 per cent, were situated in Alsace-Lorraine. For\r\nthe moment, therefore, the most economical and profitable course would\r\ncertainly be to export to Germany, as hitherto, a considerable part of\r\nthe output of the mines.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, France, having recovered the deposits of Lorraine,\r\nmay be expected to aim at replacing as far as possible the industries,\r\nwhich Germany had based on them, by industries situated within her own\r\nfrontiers. Much time must elapse before the plant and the skilled labor\r\ncould be developed within France, and even so she could hardly deal with\r\nthe ore unless she could rely on receiving the coal from Germany. The\r\nuncertainty, too, as to the ultimate fate of the Saar will be disturbing\r\nto the calculations of capitalists who contemplate the establishment of\r\nnew industries in France.\r\n\r\nIn fact, here, as elsewhere, political considerations cut disastrously\r\nacross economic. In a rÈgime of Free Trade and free economic intercourse\r\nit would be of little consequence that iron lay on one side of a\r\npolitical frontier, and labor, coal, and blast furnaces on the other.\r\nBut as it is, men have devised ways to impoverish themselves and one\r\nanother; and prefer collective animosities to individual happiness. It\r\nseems certain, calculating on the present passions and impulses of\r\nEuropean capitalistic society, that the effective iron output of Europe\r\nwill be diminished by a new political frontier (which sentiment and\r\nhistoric justice require), because nationalism and private interest are\r\nthus allowed to impose a new economic frontier along the same lines.\r\nThese latter considerations are allowed, in the present governance of\r\nEurope, to prevail over the intense need of the Continent for the most\r\nsustained and efficient production to repair the destructions of war,\r\nand to satisfy the insistence of labor for a larger reward.[54]\r\n\r\nThe same influences are likely to be seen, though on a lesser scale, in\r\nthe event of the transference of Upper Silesia to Poland. While Upper\r\nSilesia contains but little iron, the presence of coal has led to the\r\nestablishment of numerous blast furnaces. What is to be the fate of\r\nthese? If Germany is cut off from her supplies of ore on the west, will\r\nshe export beyond her frontiers on the east any part of the little which\r\nremains to her? The efficiency and output of the industry seem certain\r\nto diminish.\r\n\r\nThus the Treaty strikes at organization, and by the destruction of\r\norganization impairs yet further the reduced wealth of the whole\r\ncommunity. The economic frontiers which are to be established between\r\nthe coal and the iron, upon which modern industrialism is founded, will\r\nnot only diminish the production of useful commodities, but may possibly\r\noccupy an immense quantity of human labor in dragging iron or coal, as\r\nthe case may be, over many useless miles to satisfy the dictates of a\r\npolitical treaty or because obstructions have been established to the\r\nproper localization of industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere remain those Treaty provisions which relate to the transport and\r\nthe tariff systems of Germany. These parts of the Treaty have not nearly\r\nthe importance and the significance of those discussed hitherto. They\r\nare pin-pricks, interferences and vexations, not so much objectionable\r\nfor their solid consequences, as dishonorable to the Allies in the light\r\nof their professions. Let the reader consider what follows in the light\r\nof the assurances already quoted, in reliance on which Germany laid down\r\nher arms.\r\n\r\n(i.) The miscellaneous Economic Clauses commence with a number of\r\nprovisions which would be in accordance with the spirit of the third of\r\nthe Fourteen Points,--if they were reciprocal. Both for imports and\r\nexports, and as regards tariffs, regulations, and prohibitions, Germany\r\nbinds herself for five years to accord most-favored-nation treatment to\r\nthe Allied and Associated States.[55] But she is not entitled herself to\r\nreceive such treatment.\r\n\r\nFor five years Alsace-Lorraine shall be free to export into Germany,\r\nwithout payment of customs duty, up to the average amount sent annually\r\ninto Germany from 1911 to 1913.[56] But there is no similar provision\r\nfor German exports into Alsace-Lorraine.\r\n\r\nFor three years Polish exports to Germany, and for five years\r\nLuxemburg's exports to Germany, are to have a similar privilege,[57]--\r\nbut not German exports to Poland or to Luxemburg. Luxemburg also, which\r\nfor many years has enjoyed the benefits of inclusion within the German\r\nCustoms Union, is permanently excluded from it henceforward.[58]\r\n\r\nFor six months after the Treaty has come into force Germany may not\r\nimpose duties on imports from the Allied and Associated States higher\r\nthan the most favorable duties prevalent before the war and for a\r\nfurther two years and a half (making three years in all) this\r\nprohibition continues to apply to certain commodities, notably to some\r\nof those as to which special agreements existed before the war, and also\r\nto wine, to vegetable oils, to artificial silk, and to washed or scoured\r\nwool.[59] This is a ridiculous and injurious provision, by which Germany\r\nis prevented from taking those steps necessary to conserve her limited\r\nresources for the purchase of necessaries and the discharge of\r\nReparation. As a result of the existing distribution of wealth in\r\nGermany, and of financial wantonness amongst individuals, the offspring\r\nof uncertainty, Germany is threatened with a deluge of luxuries and\r\nsemi-luxuries from abroad, of which she has been starved for years,\r\nwhich would exhaust or diminish her small supplies of foreign exchange.\r\nThese provisions strike at the authority of the German Government to\r\nensure economy in such consumption, or to raise taxation during a\r\ncritical period. What an example of senseless greed overreaching itself,\r\nto introduce, after taking from Germany what liquid wealth she has and\r\ndemanding impossible payments for the future, a special and\r\nparticularized injunction that she must allow as readily as in the days\r\nof her prosperity the import of champagne and of silk!\r\n\r\nOne other Article affects the Customs RÈgime of Germany which, if it was\r\napplied, would be serious and extensive in its consequences. The Allies\r\nhave reserved the right to apply a special customs rÈgime to the\r\noccupied area on the bank of the Rhine, \"in the event of such a measure\r\nbeing necessary in their opinion in order to safeguard the economic\r\ninterests of the population of these territories.\"[60] This provision\r\nwas probably introduced as a possibly useful adjunct to the French\r\npolicy of somehow detaching the left bank provinces from Germany during\r\nthe years of their occupation. The project of establishing an\r\nindependent Republic under French clerical auspices, which would act as\r\na buffer state and realize the French ambition of driving Germany proper\r\nbeyond the Rhine, has not yet been abandoned. Some believe that much may\r\nbe accomplished by a rÈgime of threats, bribes, and cajolery extended\r\nover a period of fifteen years or longer.[61] If this Article is acted\r\nupon, and the economic system of the left bank of the Rhine is\r\neffectively severed from the rest of Germany, the effect would be\r\nfar-reaching. But the dreams of designing diplomats do not always\r\nprosper, and we must trust the future.\r\n\r\n(ii.) The clauses relating to Railways, as originally presented to\r\nGermany, were substantially modified in the final Treaty, and are now\r\nlimited to a provision by which goods, coming from Allied territory to\r\nGermany, or in transit through Germany, shall receive the most favored\r\ntreatment as regards rail freight rates, etc., applied to goods of the\r\nsame kind carried on _any_ German lines \"under similar conditions of\r\ntransport, for example, as regards length of route.\"[62] As a\r\nnon-reciprocal provision this is an act of interference in internal\r\narrangements which it is difficult to justify, but the practical effect\r\nof this,[63] and of an analogous provision relating to passenger\r\ntraffic,[64] will much depend on the interpretation of the phrase,\r\n\"similar conditions of transport.\"[65]\r\n\r\nFor the time being Germany's transport system will be much more\r\nseriously disordered by the provisions relating to the cession of\r\nrolling-stock. Under paragraph 7 of the Armistice conditions Germany was\r\ncalled on to surrender 5000 locomotives and 150,000 wagons, \"in good\r\nworking order, with all necessary spare parts and fittings.\" Under the\r\nTreaty Germany is required to confirm this surrender and to recognize\r\nthe title of the Allies to the material.[66] She is further required, in\r\nthe case of railway systems in ceded territory, to hand over these\r\nsystems complete with their full complement of rolling-stock \"in a\r\nnormal state of upkeep\" as shown in the last inventory before November\r\n11, 1918.[67] That is to say, ceded railway systems are not to bear any\r\nshare in the general depletion and deterioration of the German\r\nrolling-stock as a whole.\r\n\r\nThis is a loss which in course of time can doubtless be made good. But\r\nlack of lubricating oils and the prodigious wear and tear of the war,\r\nnot compensated by normal repairs, had already reduced the German\r\nrailway system to a low state of efficiency. The further heavy losses\r\nunder the Treaty will confirm this state of affairs for some time to\r\ncome, and are a substantial aggravation of the difficulties of the coal\r\nproblem and of export industry generally.\r\n\r\n(iii.) There remain the clauses relating to the river system of Germany.\r\nThese are largely unnecessary and are so little related to the supposed\r\naims of the Allies that their purport is generally unknown. Yet they\r\nconstitute an unprecedented interference with a country's domestic\r\narrangements and are capable of being so operated as to take from\r\nGermany all effective control over her own transport system. In their\r\npresent form they are incapable of justification; but some simple\r\nchanges might transform them into a reasonable instrument.\r\n\r\nMost of the principal rivers of Germany have their source or their\r\noutlet in non-German territory. The Rhine, rising in Switzerland, is now\r\na frontier river for a part of its course, and finds the sea in Holland;\r\nthe Danube rises in Germany but flows over its greater length elsewhere;\r\nthe Elbe rises in the mountains of Bohemia, now called Czecho-Slovakia;\r\nthe Oder traverses Lower Silesia; and the Niemen now bounds the frontier\r\nof East Prussia and has its source in Russia. Of these, the Rhine and\r\nthe Niemen are frontier rivers, the Elbe is primarily German but in its\r\nupper reaches has much importance for Bohemia, the Danube in its German\r\nparts appears to have little concern for any country but Germany, and\r\nthe Oder is an almost purely German river unless the result of the\r\nplebiscite is to detach all Upper Silesia.\r\n\r\nRivers which, in the words of the Treaty, \"naturally provide more than\r\none State with access to the sea,\" properly require some measure of\r\ninternational regulation and adequate guarantees against discrimination.\r\nThis principle has long been recognized in the International Commissions\r\nwhich regulate the Rhine and the Danube. But on such Commissions the\r\nStates concerned should be represented more or less in proportion to\r\ntheir interests. The Treaty, however, has made the international\r\ncharacter of these rivers a pretext for taking the river system of\r\nGermany out of German control.\r\n\r\nAfter certain Articles which provide suitably against discrimination and\r\ninterference with freedom of transit,[68] the Treaty proceeds to hand\r\nover the administration of the Elbe, the Oder, the Danube, and the Rhine\r\nto International Commissions.[69] The ultimate powers of these\r\nCommissions are to be determined by \"a General Convention drawn up by\r\nthe Allied and Associated Powers, and approved by the League of\r\nNations.\"[70] In the meantime the Commissions are to draw up their own\r\nconstitutions and are apparently to enjoy powers of the most extensive\r\ndescription, \"particularly in regard to the execution of works of\r\nmaintenance, control, and improvement on the river system, the financial\r\nrÈgime, the fixing and collection of charges, and regulations for\r\nnavigation.\"[71]\r\n\r\nSo far there is much to be said for the Treaty. Freedom of through\r\ntransit is a not unimportant part of good international practice and\r\nshould be established everywhere. The objectionable feature of the\r\nCommissions lies in their membership. In each case the voting is so\r\nweighted as to place Germany in a clear minority. On the Elbe Commission\r\nGermany has four votes out of ten; on the Oder Commission three out of\r\nnine; on the Rhine Commission four out of nineteen; on the Danube\r\nCommission, which is not yet definitely constituted, she will be\r\napparently in a small minority. On the government of all these rivers\r\nFrance and Great Britain are represented; and on the Elbe for some\r\nundiscoverable reason there are also representatives of Italy and\r\nBelgium.\r\n\r\nThus the great waterways of Germany are handed over to foreign bodies\r\nwith the widest powers; and much of the local and domestic business of\r\nHamburg, Magdeburg, Dresden, Stettin, Frankfurt, Breslan, and Ulm will\r\nbe subject to a foreign jurisdiction. It is almost as though the Powers\r\nof Continental Europe were to be placed in a majority on the Thames\r\nConservancy or the Port of London.\r\n\r\nCertain minor provisions follow lines which in our survey of the Treaty\r\nare now familiar. Under Annex III. of the Reparation Chapter Germany is\r\nto cede up to 20 per cent of her inland navigation tonnage. Over and\r\nabove this she must cede such proportion of her river craft upon the\r\nElbe, the Oder, the Niemen, and the Danube as an American arbitrator may\r\ndetermine, \"due regard being had to the legitimate needs of the parties\r\nconcerned, and particularly to the shipping traffic during the five\r\nyears preceding the war,\" the craft so ceded to be selected from those\r\nmost recently built.[72] The same course is to be followed with German\r\nvessels and tugs on the Rhine and with German property in the port of\r\nRotterdam.[73] Where the Rhine flows between France and Germany, France\r\nis to have all the rights of utilizing the water for irrigation or for\r\npower and Germany is to have none;[74] and all the bridges are to be\r\nFrench property as to their whole length.[75] Finally the administration\r\nof the purely German Rhine port of Kehl lying on the eastern bank of the\r\nriver is to be united to that of Strassburg for seven years and managed\r\nby a Frenchman to be nominated by the new Rhine Commission.\r\n\r\nThus the Economic Clauses of the Treaty are comprehensive, and little\r\nhas been overlooked which might impoverish Germany now or obstruct her\r\ndevelopment in future. So situated, Germany is to make payments of\r\nmoney, on a scale and in a manner to be examined in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] The precise force of this reservation is discussed in\r\ndetail in Chapter V.\r\n\r\n[8] I also omit those which have no special relevance to the\r\nGerman Settlement. The second of the Fourteen Points, which relates to\r\nthe Freedom of the Seas, is omitted because the Allies did not accept\r\nit. Any italics are mine.\r\n\r\n[9] Part VIII. Annex III.

At that time, however, the\r\nrailways were private property. As they afterwards became the property\r\nof the German Government, the French Government have held, in spite of\r\nthe large additional capital which Germany has sunk in them, that their\r\ntreatment must follow the precedent of State property generally.\r\n\r\n[20] Arts. 55 and 255. This follows the precedent of 1871.\r\n\r\n[21] Art. 297 (_b_).\r\n\r\n[22] Part X.

But in the final draft of the Treaty private debts are not\r\nexplicitly referred to.\r\n\r\n[24] This provision is mitigated in the case of German property\r\nin Poland and the other new States, the proceeds of liquidation in these\r\nareas being payable direct to the owner (Art. 92.)\r\n\r\n[25] Part X.

We know\r\nwhat that means. During fifteen years we are going to work on them, to\r\nattack them from every point, till we obtain from them a declaration of\r\nlove. It is evidently a less brutal proceeding than the _coup de force_\r\nwhich detached from us our Alsatians and Lorrainers. But if less brutal,\r\nit is more hypocritical. We know quite well between ourselves that it is\r\nan attempt to annex these 600,000 Germans. One can understand very well\r\nthe reasons of an economic nature which have led Clemenceau to wish to\r\ngive us these Sarre coal deposits, but in order to acquire them must we\r\ngive ourselves the appearance of wanting to juggle with 600,000 Germans\r\nin order to make Frenchmen of them in fifteen years?\" (M. HervÈ in _La\r\nVictorie_, May 31, 1919).\r\n\r\n[39] This plebiscite is the most important of the concessions\r\naccorded to Germany in the Allies' Final Note, and one for which Mr.\r\nLloyd George, who never approved the Allies' policy on the Eastern\r\nfrontiers of Germany, can claim the chief credit. The vote cannot take\r\nplace before the spring of 1920, and may be postponed until 1921. In the\r\nmeantime the province will be governed by an Allied Commission. The vote\r\nwill be taken by communes, and the final frontiers will be determined by\r\nthe Allies, who shall have regard, partly to the results of the vote in\r\neach commune, and partly \"to the geographical and economic conditions of\r\nthe locality.\" It would require great local knowledge to predict the\r\nresult. By voting Polish, a locality can escape liability for the\r\nindemnity, and for the crushing taxation consequent on voting German, a\r\nfactor not to be neglected. On the other hand, the bankruptcy and\r\nincompetence of the new Polish State might deter those who were disposed\r\nto vote on economic rather than on racial grounds. It has also been\r\nstated that the conditions of life in such matters as sanitation and\r\nsocial legislation are incomparably better in Upper Silesia than in the\r\nadjacent districts of Poland, where similar legislation is in its\r\ninfancy. The argument in the text assumes that Upper Silesia will cease\r\nto be German. But much may happen in a year, and the assumption is not\r\ncertain. To the extent that it proves erroneous the conclusions must be\r\nmodified.\r\n\r\n[40] German authorities claim, not without contradiction, that\r\nto judge from the votes cast at elections, one-third of the population\r\nwould elect in the Polish interest, and two-thirds in the German.\r\n\r\n[41] It must not be overlooked, however, that, amongst the\r\nother concessions relating to Silesia accorded in the Allies' Final\r\nNote, there has been included Article 90, by which \"Poland undertakes to\r\npermit for a period of fifteen years the exportation to Germany of the\r\nproducts of the mines in any part of Upper Silesia transferred to Poland\r\nin accordance with the present Treaty. Such products shall be free from\r\nall export duties or other charges or restrictions on exportation.\r\nPoland agrees to take such steps as may be necessary to secure that any\r\nsuch products shall be available for sale to purchasers in Germany on\r\nterms as favorable as are applicable to like products sold under similar\r\nconditions to purchasers in Poland or in any other country.\" This does\r\nnot apparently amount to a right of preemption, and it is not easy to\r\nestimate its effective practical consequences. It is evident, however,\r\nthat in so far as the mines are maintained at their former efficiency,\r\nand in so far as Germany is in a position to purchase substantially her\r\nformer supplies from that source, the loss is limited to the effect on\r\nher balance of trade, and is without the more serious repercussions on\r\nher economic life which are contemplated in the text. Here is an\r\nopportunity for the Allies to render more tolerable the actual operation\r\nof the settlement. The Germans, it should be added, have pointed out\r\nthat the same economic argument which adds the Saar fields to France\r\nallots Upper Silesia to Germany. For whereas the Silesian mines are\r\nessential to the economic life of Germany, Poland does not need them. Of\r\nPoland's pre-war annual demand of 10,500,000 tons, 6,800,000 tons were\r\nsupplied by the indisputably Polish districts adjacent to Upper Silesia.\r\n1,500,000 tons from Upper Silesia (out of a total Upper Silesian output\r\nof 43,500,000 tons), and the balance from what is now Czecho-Slovakia.\r\nEven without any supply from Upper Silesia and Czecho-Slovakia, Poland\r\ncould probably meet her requirements by the fuller exploitation of her\r\nown coalfields which are not yet scientifically developed, or from the\r\ndeposits of Western Galicia which are now to be annexed to her.\r\n\r\n[42] France is also to receive annually for three years 35,000\r\ntons of benzol, 60,000 tons of coal tar, and 30,000 tons of sulphate of\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\n[43] The Reparation Commission is authorized under the Treaty\r\n(Part VIII Annex V. para. 10) \"to postpone or to cancel deliveries\" if\r\nthey consider \"that the full exercise of the foregoing options would\r\ninterfere unduly with the industrial requirements of Germany.\" In the\r\nevent of such postponements or cancellations \"the coal to replace coal\r\nfrom destroyed mines shall receive priority over other deliveries.\" This\r\nconcluding clause is of the greatest importance, if, as will be seen, it\r\nis physically impossible for Germany to furnish the full 45,000,000; for\r\nit means that France will receive 20,000,000 tons before Italy receives\r\nanything. The Reparation Commission has no discretion to modify this.\r\nThe Italian Press has not failed to notice the significance of the\r\nprovision, and alleges that this clause was inserted during the absence\r\nof the Italian representatives from Paris (_Corriere della Sera_, July\r\n19, 1919).\r\n\r\n[44] It follows that the current rate of production in Germany\r\nhas sunk to about 60 per cent of that of 1913. The effect on reserves\r\nhas naturally been disastrous, and the prospects for the coming winter\r\nare dangerous.\r\n\r\n[45] This assumes a loss of output of 15 per cent as compared\r\nwith the estimate of 30 per cent quoted above.\r\n\r\n[46] This supposes a loss of 23 per cent of Germany's\r\nindustrial undertaking and a diminution of 13 per cent in her other\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n[47] The reader must be reminded in particular that the above\r\ncalculations take no account of the German production of lignite, which\r\nyielded in 1913 13,000,000 tons of rough lignite in addition to an\r\namount converted into 21,000,000 tons of briquette. This amount of\r\nlignite, however, was required in Germany before the war _in addition\r\nto_ the quantities of coal assumed above. I am not competent to speak on\r\nthe extent to which the loss of coal can be made good by the extended\r\nuse of lignite or by economies in its present employment; but some\r\nauthorities believe that Germany may obtain substantial compensation for\r\nher loss of coal by paying more attention to her deposits of lignite.\r\n\r\n[48] Mr. Hoover, in July, 1919, estimated that the coal output\r\nof Europe, excluding Russia and the Balkans, had dropped from\r\n679,500,000 tons to 443,000,000 tons,--as a result in a minor degree of\r\nloss of material and labor, but owing chiefly to a relaxation of\r\nphysical effort after the privations and sufferings of the war, a lack\r\nof rolling-stock and transport, and the unsettled political fate of some\r\nof the mining districts.\r\n\r\n[49] Numerous commercial agreements during the war ware\r\narranged on these lines. But in the month of June, 1919, alone, minor\r\nagreements providing for payment in coal were made by Germany with\r\nDenmark, Norway, and Switzerland. The amounts involved were not large,\r\nbut without them Germany could not have obtained butter from Denmark,\r\nfats and herrings from Norway, or milk and cattle from Switzerland.\r\n\r\n[50] \"Some 60,000 Ruhr miners have agreed to work extra\r\nshifts--so-called butter-shifts--for the purpose of furnishing coal for\r\nexport to Denmark hence butter will be exported in return. The butter\r\nwill benefit the miners in the first place, as they have worked\r\nspecially to obtain it\" (_Kˆlnische Zeitung_, June 11, 1919).\r\n\r\n[51] What of the prospects of whisky-shifts in England?\r\n\r\n[52] As early as September, 1919, the Coal Commission had to\r\nface the physical impracticability of enforcing the demands of the\r\nTreaty, and agreed to modify them as follows:--\"Germany shall in the\r\nnext six months make deliveries corresponding to an annual delivery of\r\n20 million tons as compared with 43 millions as provided in the Peace\r\nTreaty. If Germany's total production exceeds the present level of about\r\n108 millions a year, 60 per cent of extra production, up to 128\r\nmillions, shall be delivered to the Entente and 50 per cent of any extra\r\nbeyond that, until the figure provided in the Peace Treaty is reached.\r\nIf the total production falls below 108 millions the Entente will\r\nexamine the situation, after hearing Germany, and take account of it.\"\r\n\r\n[53] 21,136,265 tons out of a total of 28,607,903 tons. The\r\nloss of iron-ore in respect of Upper Silesia is insignificant. The\r\nexclusion of the iron and steel of Luxemburg from the German Customs\r\nUnion is, however, important, especially when this loss is added to that\r\nof Alsace-Lorraine. It may be added in passing that Upper Silesia\r\nincludes 75 per cent of the zinc production of Germany.\r\n\r\n[54] In April, 1919, the British Ministry of Munitions\r\ndespatched an expert Commission to examine the conditions of the iron\r\nand steel works in Lorraine and the occupied areas of Germany. The\r\nReport states that the iron and steel works in Lorraine, and to a lesser\r\nextent in the Saar Valley, are dependent on supplies of coal and coke\r\nfrom Westphalia. It is necessary to mix Westphalian coal with Saar coal\r\nto obtain a good furnace coke. The entire dependence of all the Lorraine\r\niron and steel works upon Germany for fuel supplies \"places them,\" says\r\nthe Report, \"in a very unenviable position.\"\r\n\r\n[55] Arts. 264, 265, 266, and 267. These provisions can only be\r\nextended beyond five years by the Council of the League of Nations.\r\n\r\n[56] Art. 268 (_a_).\r\n\r\n[57] Art. 268 (_b_) and (_c_).\r\n\r\n[58] The Grand Duchy is also deneutralized and Germany binds\r\nherself to \"accept in advance all international arrangements which may\r\nbe concluded by the Allied and Associated Powers relating to the Grand\r\nDuchy\" (Art. 40). At the end of September, 1919, a plebiscite was held\r\nto determine whether Luxemburg should join the French or the Belgian\r\nCustoms Union, which decided by a substantial majority in favour of the\r\nformer. The third alternative of the maintenance of the union with\r\nGermany was not left open to the electorate.\r\n\r\n[59] Art. 269.\r\n\r\n[60] Art. 270.\r\n\r\n[61] The occupation provisions may be conveniently summarized\r\nat this point. German territory situated west of the Rhine, together\r\nwith the bridge-heads, is subject to occupation for a period of fifteen\r\nyears (Art. 428). If, however, \"the conditions of the present Treaty are\r\nfaithfully carried out by Germany,\" the Cologne district will be\r\nevacuated after five years, and the Coblenz district after ten years\r\n(Art. 429). It is, however, further provided that if at the expiration\r\nof fifteen years \"the guarantees against unprovoked aggression by\r\nGermany are not considered sufficient by the Allied and Associated\r\nGovernments, the evacuation of the occupying troops may be delayed to\r\nthe extent regarded as necessary for the purpose of obtaining the\r\nrequired guarantees\" (Art. 429); and also that \"in case either during\r\nthe occupation or after the expiration of the fifteen years, the\r\nReparation Commission finds that Germany refuses to observe the whole or\r\npart of her obligations under the present Treaty with regard to\r\nReparation, the whole or part of the areas specified in Article 429 will\r\nbe re-occupied immediately by the Allied and Associated Powers\" (Art.\r\n430). Since it will be impossible for Germany to fulfil the whole of her\r\nReparation obligations, the effect of the above provisions will be in\r\npractice that the Allies will occupy the left bank of the Rhine just so\r\nlong as they choose. They will also govern it in such manner as they may\r\ndetermine (_e.g._ not only as regards customs, but such matters as the\r\nrespective authority of the local German representatives and the Allied\r\nGoverning Commission), since \"all matters relating to the occupation and\r\nnot provided for by the present Treaty shall be regulated by subsequent\r\nagreements, which Germany hereby undertakes to observe\" (Art. 432). The\r\nactual Agreement under which the occupied areas are to be administered\r\nfor the present has been published as a White Paper [Cd. 222]. The\r\nsupreme authority is to be in the hands of an Inter-Allied Rhineland\r\nCommission, consisting of a Belgian, a French, a British, and an\r\nAmerican member. The articles of this Agreement are very fairly and\r\nreasonably drawn.\r\n\r\n[62] Art. 365. After five years this Article is subject to\r\nrevision by the Council of the League of Nations.\r\n\r\n[63] The German Government withdrew, as from September 1, 1919,\r\nall preferential railway tariffs for the export of iron and steel goods,\r\non the ground that these privileges would have been more than\r\ncounterbalanced by the corresponding privileges which, under this\r\nArticle of the Treaty, they would have been forced to give to Allied\r\ntraders.\r\n\r\n[64] Art. 367.\r\n\r\n[65] Questions of interpretation and application are to be\r\nreferred to the League of Nations (Art. 376).\r\n\r\n[66] Art. 250.\r\n\r\n[67] Art 371. This provision is even applied \"to the lines of\r\nformer Russian Poland converted by Germany to the German gage, such\r\nlines being regarded as detached from the Prussian State System.\"\r\n\r\n[68] Arts. 332-337. Exception may be taken, however, to the\r\nsecond paragraph of Art. 332, which allows the vessels of other nations\r\nto trade between German towns but forbids German vessels to trade\r\nbetween non-German towns except with special permission; and Art. 333,\r\nwhich prohibits Germany from making use of her river system as a source\r\nof revenue, may be injudicious.\r\n\r\n[69] The Niemen and the Moselle are to be similarly treated at\r\na later date if required.\r\n\r\n[70] Art. 338.\r\n\r\n[71] Art. 344. This is with particular reference to the Elbe\r\nand the Oder; the Danube and the Rhine are dealt with in relation to the\r\nexisting Commissions.\r\n\r\n[72] Art. 339.\r\n\r\n[73] Art. 357.\r\n\r\n[74] Art. 358. Germany is, however, to be allowed some payment\r\nor credit in respect of power so taken by France.\r\n\r\n[75] Art. 66.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nREPARATION\r\n\r\n\r\nI. _Undertakings given prior to the Peace Negotiations_\r\n\r\nThe categories of damage in respect of which the Allies were entitled to\r\nask for Reparation are governed by the relevant passages in President\r\nWilson's Fourteen Points of January 8, 1918, as modified by the Allied\r\nGovernments in their qualifying Note, the text of which the President\r\nformally communicated to the German Government as the basis of peace on\r\nNovember 5, 1918. These passages have been quoted in full at the\r\nbeginning of Chapter IV. That is to say, \"compensation will be made by\r\nGermany for all damage done to the civilian population of the Allies and\r\nto their property by the aggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from\r\nthe air.\" The limiting quality of this sentence is reinforced by the\r\npassage in the President's speech before Congress on February 11, 1918\r\n(the terms of this speech being an express part of the contract with the\r\nenemy), that there shall be \"no contributions\" and \"no punitive\r\ndamages.\"\r\n\r\nIt has sometimes been argued that the preamble to paragraph 19[76] of\r\nthe Armistice Terms, to the effect \"that any future claims and demands\r\nof the Allies and the United States of America remain unaffected,\" wiped\r\nout all precedent conditions, and left the Allies free to make whatever\r\ndemands they chose. But it is not possible to maintain that this casual\r\nprotective phrase, to which no one at the time attached any particular\r\nimportance, did away with all the formal communications which passed\r\nbetween the President and the German Government as to the basis of the\r\nTerms of Peace during the days preceding the Armistice, abolished the\r\nFourteen Points, and converted the German acceptance of the Armistice\r\nTerms into unconditional surrender, so far as it affects the Financial\r\nClauses. It is merely the usual phrase of the draftsman, who, about to\r\nrehearse a list of certain claims, wishes to guard himself from the\r\nimplication that such list is exhaustive. In any case, this contention\r\nis disposed of by the Allied reply to the German observations on the\r\nfirst draft of the Treaty, where it is admitted that the terms of the\r\nReparation Chapter must be governed by the President's Note of November\r\n5.\r\n\r\nAssuming then that the terms of this Note are binding, we are left to\r\nelucidate the precise force of the phrase--\"all damage done to the\r\ncivilian population of the Allies and to their property by the\r\naggression of Germany by land, by sea, and from the air.\" Few sentences\r\nin history have given so much work to the sophists and the lawyers, as\r\nwe shall see in the next section of this chapter, as this apparently\r\nsimple and unambiguous statement. Some have not scrupled to argue that\r\nit covers the entire cost of the war; for, they point out, the entire\r\ncost of the war has to be met by taxation, and such taxation is\r\n\"damaging to the civilian population.\" They admit that the phrase is\r\ncumbrous, and that it would have been simpler to have said \"all loss and\r\nexpenditure of whatever description\"; and they allow that the apparent\r\nemphasis of damage to the persons and property of _civilians_ is\r\nunfortunate; but errors of draftsmanship should not, in their opinion,\r\nshut off the Allies from the rights inherent in victors.\r\n\r\nBut there are not only the limitations of the phrase in its natural\r\nmeaning and the emphasis on civilian damages as distinct from military\r\nexpenditure generally; it must also be remembered that the context of\r\nthe term is in elucidation of the meaning of the term \"restoration\" in\r\nthe President's Fourteen Points. The Fourteen Points provide for damage\r\nin invaded territory--Belgium, France, Roumania, Serbia, and Montenegro\r\n(Italy being unaccountably omitted)--but they do not cover losses at sea\r\nby submarine, bombardments from the sea (as at Scarborough), or damage\r\ndone by air raids. It was to repair these omissions, which involved\r\nlosses to the life and property of civilians not really distinguishable\r\nin kind from those effected in occupied territory, that the Supreme\r\nCouncil of the Allies in Paris proposed to President Wilson their\r\nqualifications. At that time--the last days of October, 1918--I do not\r\nbelieve that any responsible statesman had in mind the exaction from\r\nGermany of an indemnity for the general costs of the war. They sought\r\nonly to make it clear (a point of considerable importance to Great\r\nBritain) that reparation for damage done to non-combatants and their\r\nproperty was not limited to invaded territory (as it would have been by\r\nthe Fourteen Points unqualified), but applied equally to _all_ such\r\ndamage, whether \"by land, by sea, or from the air\" It was only at a\r\nlater stage that a general popular demand for an indemnity, covering\r\nthe full costs of the war, made it politically desirable to practise\r\ndishonesty and to try to discover in the written word what was not\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nWhat damages, then, can be claimed from the enemy on a strict\r\ninterpretation of our engagements?[77] In the case of the United Kingdom\r\nthe bill would cover the following items:--\r\n\r\n(a) Damage to civilian life and property by the acts of an enemy\r\nGovernment including damage by air raids, naval bombardments, submarine\r\nwarfare, and mines.\r\n\r\n(b) Compensation for improper treatment of interned civilians.\r\n\r\nIt would not include the general costs of the war, or (_e.g._) indirect\r\ndamage due to loss of trade.\r\n\r\nThe French claim would include, as well as items corresponding to the\r\nabove:--\r\n\r\n(c) Damage done to the property and persons of civilians in the war\r\narea, and by aerial warfare behind the enemy lines.\r\n\r\n(d) Compensation for loot of food, raw materials, live-stock, machinery,\r\nhousehold effects, timber, and the like by the enemy Governments or\r\ntheir nationals in territory occupied by them.\r\n\r\n(e) Repayment of fines and requisitions levied by the enemy Governments\r\nor their officers on French municipalities or nationals.\r\n\r\n(f) Compensation to French nationals deported or compelled to do forced\r\nlabor.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above there is a further item of more doubtful\r\ncharacter, namely--\r\n\r\n(g) The expenses of the Relief Commission in providing necessary food\r\nand clothing to maintain the civilian French population in the\r\nenemy-occupied districts.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian claim would include similar items.[78] If it were argued\r\nthat in the case of Belgium something more nearly resembling an\r\nindemnity for general war costs can be justified, this could only be on\r\nthe ground of the breach of International Law involved in the invasion\r\nof Belgium, whereas, as we have seen, the Fourteen Points include no\r\nspecial demands on this ground.[79] As the cost of Belgian Belief under\r\n(g), as well as her general war costs, has been met already by advances\r\nfrom the British, French, and United States Governments, Belgium would\r\npresumably employ any repayment of them by Germany in part discharge of\r\nher debt to these Governments, so that any such demands are, in effect,\r\nan addition to the claims of the three lending Governments.\r\n\r\nThe claims of the other Allies would be compiled on similar lines. But\r\nin their case the question arises more acutely how far Germany can be\r\nmade contingently liable for damage done, not by herself, but by her\r\nco-belligerents, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and Turkey. This is one of\r\nthe many questions to which the Fourteen Points give no clear answer; on\r\nthe one hand, they cover explicitly in Point 11 damage done to Roumania,\r\nSerbia, and Montenegro, without qualification as to the nationality of\r\nthe troops inflicting the damage; on the other hand, the Note of the\r\nAllies speaks of \"German\" aggression when it might have spoken of the\r\naggression of \"Germany and her allies.\" On a strict and literal\r\ninterpretation, I doubt if claims lie against Germany for damage\r\ndone,--_e.g._ by the Turks to the Suez Canal, or by Austrian submarines\r\nin the Adriatic. But it is a case where, if the Allies wished to strain\r\na point, they could impose contingent liability on Germany without\r\nrunning seriously contrary to the general intention of their\r\nengagements.\r\n\r\nAs between the Allies themselves the case is quite different. It would\r\nbe an act of gross unfairness and infidelity if France and Great Britain\r\nwere to take what Germany could pay and leave Italy and Serbia to get\r\nwhat they could out of the remains of Austria-Hungary. As amongst the\r\nAllies themselves it is clear that assets should be pooled and shared\r\nout in proportion to aggregate claims.\r\n\r\nIn this event, and if my estimate is accepted, as given below, that\r\nGermany's capacity to pay will be exhausted by the direct and legitimate\r\nclaims which the Allies hold against her, the question of her contingent\r\nliability for her allies becomes academic. Prudent and honorable\r\nstatesmanship would therefore have given her the benefit of the doubt,\r\nand claimed against her nothing but the damage she had herself caused.\r\n\r\nWhat, on the above basis of claims, would the aggregate demand amount\r\nto? No figures exist on which to base any scientific or exact estimate,\r\nand I give my own guess for what it is worth, prefacing it with the\r\nfollowing observations.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the material damage done in the invaded districts has been\r\nthe subject of enormous, if natural, exaggeration. A journey through the\r\ndevastated areas of France is impressive to the eye and the imagination\r\nbeyond description. During the winter of 1918-19, before Nature had\r\ncast over the scene her ameliorating mantle, the horror and desolation\r\nof war was made visible to sight on an extraordinary scale of blasted\r\ngrandeur. The completeness of the destruction was evident. For mile\r\nafter mile nothing was left. No building was habitable and no field fit\r\nfor the plow. The sameness was also striking. One devastated area was\r\nexactly like another--a heap of rubble, a morass of shell-holes, and a\r\ntangle of wire.[80] The amount of human labor which would be required to\r\nrestore such a countryside seemed incalculable; and to the returned\r\ntraveler any number of milliards of dollars was inadequate to express in\r\nmatter the destruction thus impressed upon his spirit. Some Governments\r\nfor a variety of intelligible reasons have not been ashamed to exploit\r\nthese feelings a little.\r\n\r\nPopular sentiment is most at fault, I think, in the case of Belgium. In\r\nany event Belgium is a small country, and in its case the actual area of\r\ndevastation is a small proportion of the whole. The first onrush of the\r\nGermans in 1914 did some damage locally; after that the battle-line in\r\nBelgium did not sway backwards and forwards, as in France, over a deep\r\nbelt of country. It was practically stationary, and hostilities were\r\nconfined to a small corner of the country, much of which in recent times\r\nwas backward, poor, and sleepy, and did not include the active industry\r\nof the country. There remains some injury in the small flooded area, the\r\ndeliberate damage done by the retreating Germans to buildings, plant,\r\nand transport, and the loot of machinery, cattle, and other movable\r\nproperty. But Brussels, Antwerp, and even Ostend are substantially\r\nintact, and the great bulk of the land, which is Belgium's chief wealth,\r\nis nearly as well cultivated as before. The traveler by motor can pass\r\nthrough and from end to end of the devastated area of Belgium almost\r\nbefore he knows it; whereas the destruction in France is on a different\r\nkind of scale altogether. Industrially, the loot has been serious and\r\nfor the moment paralyzing; but the actual money cost of replacing\r\nmachinery mounts up slowly, and a few tens of millions would have\r\ncovered the value of every machine of every possible description that\r\nBelgium ever possessed. Besides, the cold statistician must not overlook\r\nthe fact that the Belgian people possess the instinct of individual\r\nself-protection unusually well developed; and the great mass of German\r\nbank-notes[81] held in the country at the date of the Armistice, shows\r\nthat certain classes of them at least found a way, in spite of all the\r\nseverities and barbarities of German rule, to profit at the expense of\r\nthe invader. Belgian claims against Germany such as I have seen,\r\namounting to a sum in excess of the total estimated pre-war wealth of\r\nthe whole country, are simply irresponsible.[82]\r\n\r\nIt will help to guide our ideas to quote the official survey of Belgian\r\nwealth, published in 1913 by the Finance Ministry of Belgium, which was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    Land                 $1,320,000,000\r\n    Buildings             1,175,000,000\r\n    Personal wealth       2,725,000,000\r\n    Cash                     85,000,000\r\n    Furniture, etc          600,000,000\r\n                         --------------\r\n                         $5,905,000,000\r\n\r\nThis total yields an average of $780 per inhabitant, which Dr. Stamp,\r\nthe highest authority on the subject, is disposed to consider as _prima\r\nfacie_ too low (though he does not accept certain much higher estimates\r\nlately current), the corresponding wealth per head (to take Belgium's\r\nimmediate neighbors) being $835 for Holland, $1,220 for Germany, and\r\n$1,515 for France.[83] A total of $7,500,000,000, giving an average of\r\nabout $1,000 per head, would, however, be fairly liberal. The official\r\nestimate of land and buildings is likely to be more accurate than the\r\nrest. On the other hand, allowance has to be made for the increased\r\ncosts of construction.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to all these considerations, I do not put the money value\r\nof the actual _physical_ loss of Belgian property by destruction and\r\nloot above $750,000,000 _as a maximum_, and while I hesitate to put yet\r\nlower an estimate which differs so widely from those generally current,\r\nI shall be surprised if it proves possible to substantiate claims even\r\nto this amount. Claims in respect of levies, fines, requisitions, and so\r\nforth might possibly amount to a further $500,000,000. If the sums\r\nadvanced to Belgium by her allies for the general costs of the war are\r\nto be included, a sum of about $1,250,000,000 has to be added (which\r\nincludes the cost of relief), bringing the total to $2,500,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe destruction in France was on an altogether more significant scale,\r\nnot only as regards the length of the battle line, but also on account\r\nof the immensely deeper area of country over which the battle swayed\r\nfrom time to time. It is a popular delusion to think of Belgium as the\r\nprincipal victim of the war; it will turn out, I believe, that taking\r\naccount of casualties, loss of property and burden of future debt,\r\nBelgium has made the least relative sacrifice of all the belligerents\r\nexcept the United States. Of the Allies, Serbia's sufferings and loss\r\nhave been proportionately the greatest, and after Serbia, France. France\r\nin all essentials was just as much the victim of German ambition as was\r\nBelgium, and France's entry into the war was just as unavoidable.\r\nFrance, in my judgment, in spite of her policy at the Peace Conference,\r\na policy largely traceable to her sufferings, has the greatest claims on\r\nour generosity.\r\n\r\nThe special position occupied by Belgium in the popular mind is due, of\r\ncourse, to the fact that in 1914 her sacrifice was by far the greatest\r\nof any of the Allies. But after 1914 she played a minor rÙle.\r\nConsequently, by the end of 1918, her relative sacrifices, apart from\r\nthose sufferings from invasion which cannot be measured in money, had\r\nfallen behind, and in some respects they were not even as great, for\r\nexample, as Australia's. I say this with no wish to evade the\r\nobligations towards Belgium under which the pronouncements of our\r\nresponsible statesmen at many different dates have certainly laid us.\r\nGreat Britain ought not to seek any payment at all from Germany for\r\nherself until the just claims of Belgium have been fully satisfied. But\r\nthis is no reason why we or they should not tell the truth about the\r\namount.\r\n\r\nWhile the French claims are immensely greater, here too there has been\r\nexcessive exaggeration, as responsible French statisticians have\r\nthemselves pointed out. Not above 10 per cent of the area of France was\r\neffectively occupied by the enemy, and not above 4 per cent lay within\r\nthe area of substantial devastation. Of the sixty French towns having a\r\npopulation exceeding 35,000, only two were destroyed--Reims (115,178)\r\nand St. Quentin (55,571); three others were occupied--Lille, Roubaix,\r\nand Douai--and suffered from loot of machinery and other property, but\r\nwere not substantially injured otherwise. Amiens, Calais, Dunkerque, and\r\nBoulogne suffered secondary damage by bombardment and from the air; but\r\nthe value of Calais and Boulogne must have been increased by the new\r\nworks of various kinds erected for the use of the British Army.\r\n\r\nThe _Annuaire Statistique de la France, 1917_, values the entire house\r\nproperty of France at $11,900,000,000 (59.5 milliard francs).[84] An\r\nestimate current in France of $4,000,000,000 (20 milliard francs) for\r\nthe destruction of house property alone is, therefore, obviously wide of\r\nthe mark.[85] $600,000,000 at pre-war prices, or say $1,250,000,000 at\r\nthe present time, is much nearer the right figure. Estimates of the\r\nvalue of the land of France (apart from buildings) vary from\r\n$12,400,000,000 to $15,580,000,000, so that it would be extravagant to\r\nput the damage on this head as high as $500,000,000. Farm Capital for\r\nthe whole of France has not been put by responsible authorities above\r\n$2,100,000,000.[86] There remain the loss of furniture and machinery,\r\nthe damage to the coal-mines and the transport system, and many other\r\nminor items. But these losses, however serious, cannot be reckoned in\r\nvalue by hundreds of millions of dollars in respect of so small a part\r\nof France. In short, it will be difficult to establish a bill exceeding\r\n$2,500,000,000 for _physical and material_ damage in the occupied and\r\ndevastated areas of Northern France.[87] I am confirmed in this estimate\r\nby the opinion of M. RenÈ Pupin, the author of the most comprehensive\r\nand scientific estimate of the pre-war wealth of France,[88] which I did\r\nnot come across until after my own figure had been arrived at. This\r\nauthority estimates the material losses of the invaded regions at from\r\n$2,000,000,000 to $3,000,000,000 (10 to 15 milliards),[89] between which\r\nmy own figure falls half-way.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, M. Dubois, speaking on behalf of the Budget Commission of\r\nthe Chamber, has given the figure of $13,000,000,000 (65 milliard\r\nfrancs) \"as a minimum\" without counting \"war levies, losses at sea, the\r\nroads, or the loss of public monuments.\" And M. Loucheur, the Minister\r\nof Industrial Reconstruction, stated before the Senate on the 17th\r\nFebruary, 1919, that the reconstitution of the devastated regions would\r\ninvolve an expenditure of $15,000,000,000 (75 milliard francs),--more\r\nthan double M. Pupin's estimate of the entire wealth of their\r\ninhabitants. But then at that time M. Loucheur was taking a prominent\r\npart in advocating the claims of France before the Peace Conference,\r\nand, like others, may have found strict veracity inconsistent with the\r\ndemands of patriotism.[90]\r\n\r\nThe figure discussed so far is not, however, the totality of the French\r\nclaims. There remain, in particular, levies and requisitions on the\r\noccupied areas and the losses of the French mercantile marine at sea\r\nfrom the attacks of German cruisers and submarines. Probably\r\n$1,000,000,000 would be ample to cover all such claims; but to be on the\r\nsafe side, we will, somewhat arbitrarily, make an addition to the French\r\nclaim of $1,500,000,000 on all heads, bringing it to $4,000,000,000 in\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThe statements of M. Dubois and M. Loucheur were made in the early\r\nspring of 1919. A speech delivered by M. Klotz before the French Chamber\r\nsix months later (Sept. 5, 1919) was less excusable. In this speech the\r\nFrench Minister of Finance estimated the total French claims for damage\r\nto property (presumably inclusive of losses at sea, etc., but apart from\r\npensions and allowances) at $26,800,000,000 (134 milliard francs), or\r\nmore than six times my estimate. Even if my figure prove erroneous, M.\r\nKlotz's can never have been justified. So grave has been the deception\r\npractised on the French people by their Ministers that when the\r\ninevitable enlightenment comes, as it soon must (both as to their own\r\nclaims and as to Germany's capacity to meet them), the repercussions\r\nwill strike at more than M. Klotz, and may even involve the order of\r\nGovernment and Society for which he stands.\r\n\r\nBritish claims on the present basis would be practically limited to\r\nlosses by sea--losses of hulls and losses of cargoes. Claims would lie,\r\nof course, for damage to civilian property in air raids and by\r\nbombardment from the sea, but in relation to such figures as we are now\r\ndealing with, the money value involved is insignificant,--$25,000,000\r\nmight cover them all, and $50,000,000 would certainly do so.\r\n\r\nThe British mercantile vessels lost by enemy action, excluding fishing\r\nvessels, numbered 2479, with an aggregate of 7,759,090 tons gross.[91]\r\nThere is room for considerable divergence of opinion as to the proper\r\nrate to take for replacement cost; at the figure of $150 per gross ton,\r\nwhich with the rapid growth of shipbuilding may soon be too high but can\r\nbe replaced by any other which better authorities[92] may prefer, the\r\naggregate claim is $1,150,000,000. To this must be added the loss of\r\ncargoes, the value of which is almost entirely a matter of guesswork. An\r\nestimate of $200 per ton of shipping lost may be as good an\r\napproximation as is possible, that is to say $1,550,000,000, making\r\n$2,700,000,000 altogether.\r\n\r\nAn addition to this of $150,000,000, to cover air raids, bombardments,\r\nclaims of interned civilians, and miscellaneous items of every\r\ndescription, should be more than sufficient,--making a total claim for\r\nGreat Britain of $2,850,000,000. It is surprising, perhaps, that the\r\nmoney value of Great Britain's claim should be so little short of that\r\nof France and actually in excess of that of Belgium. But, measured\r\neither by pecuniary loss or real loss to the economic power of the\r\ncountry, the injury to her mercantile marine was enormous.\r\n\r\nThere remain the claims of Italy, Serbia, and Roumania for damage by\r\ninvasion and of these and other countries, as for example Greece,[93]\r\nfor losses at sea. I will assume for the present argument that these\r\nclaims rank against Germany, even when they were directly caused not by\r\nher but by her allies; but that it is not proposed to enter any such\r\nclaims on behalf of Russia.[94] Italy's losses by invasion and at sea\r\ncannot be very heavy, and a figure of from $250,000,000 to $500,000,000\r\nwould be fully adequate to cover them. The losses of Serbia, although\r\nfrom a human point of view her sufferings were the greatest of all,[95]\r\nare not measured _pecuniarily_ by very great figures, on account of her\r\nlow economic development. Dr. Stamp (_loc. cit._) quotes an estimate by\r\nthe Italian statistician Maroi, which puts the national wealth of Serbia\r\nat $2,400,000,000 or $525 per head,[96] and the greater part of this\r\nwould be represented by land which has sustained no permanent\r\ndamage.[97] In view of the very inadequate data for guessing at more\r\nthan the _general magnitude_ of the legitimate claims of this group of\r\ncountries, I prefer to make one guess rather than several and to put the\r\nfigure for the whole group at the round sum of $1,250,000,000.\r\n\r\nWe are finally left with the following--\r\n\r\n    Belgium        $ 2,500,000,000[98]\r\n    France           4,000,000,000\r\n    Great Britain    2,850,000,000\r\n    Other Allies     1,250,000,000\r\n                   ---------------\r\n    Total          $10,600,000,000\r\n\r\nI need not impress on the reader that there is much guesswork in the\r\nabove, and the figure for France in particular is likely to be\r\ncriticized. But I feel some confidence that the _general magnitude_, as\r\ndistinct from the precise figures, is not hopelessly erroneous; and this\r\nmay be expressed by the statement that a claim against Germany, based on\r\nthe interpretation of the pre-Armistice engagements of the Allied\r\nPowers which is adopted above, would assuredly be found to exceed\r\n$8,000,000,000 and to fall short of $15,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nThis is the amount of the claim which we were entitled to present to the\r\nenemy. For reasons which will appear more fully later on, I believe that\r\nit would have been a wise and just act to have asked the German\r\nGovernment at the Peace Negotiations to agree to a sum of\r\n$10,000,000,000 in final settlement, without further examination of\r\nparticulars. This would have provided an immediate and certain solution,\r\nand would have required from Germany a sum which, if she were granted\r\ncertain indulgences, it might not have proved entirely impossible for\r\nher to pay. This sum should have been divided up amongst the Allies\r\nthemselves on a basis of need and general equity.\r\n\r\nBut the question was not settled on its merits.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. _The Conference and the Terms of the Treaty_\r\n\r\nI do not believe that, at the date of the Armistice, responsible\r\nauthorities in the Allied countries expected any indemnity from Germany\r\nbeyond the cost of reparation for the direct material damage which had\r\nresulted from the invasion of Allied territory and from the submarine\r\ncampaign. At that time there were serious doubts as to whether Germany\r\nintended to accept our terms, which in other respects were inevitably\r\nvery severe, and it would have been thought an unstatesmanlike act to\r\nrisk a continuance of the war by demanding a money payment which Allied\r\nopinion was not then anticipating and which probably could not be\r\nsecured in any case. The French, I think, never quite accepted this\r\npoint of view; but it was certainly the British attitude; and in this\r\natmosphere the pre-Armistice conditions were framed.\r\n\r\nA month later the atmosphere had changed completely. We had discovered\r\nhow hopeless the German position really was, a discovery which some,\r\nthough not all, had anticipated, but which no one had dared reckon on as\r\na certainty. It was evident that we could have secured unconditional\r\nsurrender if we had determined to get it.\r\n\r\nBut there was another new factor in the situation which was of greater\r\nlocal importance. The British Prime Minister had perceived that the\r\nconclusion of hostilities might soon bring with it the break-up of the\r\npolitical _bloc_ upon which he was depending for his personal\r\nascendency, and that the domestic difficulties which would be attendant\r\non demobilization, the turn-over of industry from war to peace\r\nconditions, the financial situation, and the general psychological\r\nreactions of men's minds, would provide his enemies with powerful\r\nweapons, if he were to leave them time to mature. The best chance,\r\ntherefore, of consolidating his power, which was personal and exercised,\r\nas such, independently of party or principle, to an extent unusual in\r\nBritish politics, evidently lay in active hostilities before the\r\nprestige of victory had abated, and in an attempt to found on the\r\nemotions of the moment a new basis of power which might outlast the\r\ninevitable reactions of the near future. Within a brief period,\r\ntherefore, after the Armistice, the popular victor, at the height of his\r\ninfluence and his authority, decreed a General Election. It was widely\r\nrecognized at the time as an act of political immorality. There were no\r\ngrounds of public interest which did not call for a short delay until\r\nthe issues of the new age had a little defined themselves and until the\r\ncountry had something more specific before it on which to declare its\r\nmind and to instruct its new representatives. But the claims of private\r\nambition determined otherwise.\r\n\r\nFor a time all went well. But before the campaign was far advanced\r\nGovernment candidates were finding themselves handicapped by the lack of\r\nan effective cry. The War Cabinet was demanding a further lease of\r\nauthority on the ground of having won the war. But partly because the\r\nnew issues had not yet defined themselves, partly out of regard for the\r\ndelicate balance of a Coalition Party, the Prime Minister's future\r\npolicy was the subject of silence or generalities. The campaign seemed,\r\ntherefore, to fall a little flat. In the light of subsequent events it\r\nseems improbable that the Coalition Party was ever in real danger. But\r\nparty managers are easily \"rattled.\" The Prime Minister's more neurotic\r\nadvisers told him that he was not safe from dangerous surprises, and the\r\nPrime Minister lent an ear to them. The party managers demanded more\r\n\"ginger.\" The Prime Minister looked about for some.\r\n\r\nOn the assumption that the return of the Prime Minister to power was the\r\nprimary consideration, the rest followed naturally. At that juncture\r\nthere was a clamor from certain quarters that the Government had given\r\nby no means sufficiently clear undertakings that they were not going \"to\r\nlet the Hun off.\" Mr. Hughes was evoking a good deal of attention by his\r\ndemands for a very large indemnity,[99] and Lord Northcliffe was lending\r\nhis powerful aid to the same cause. This pointed the Prime Minister to\r\na stone for two birds. By himself adopting the policy of Mr. Hughes and\r\nLord Northcliffe, he could at the same time silence those powerful\r\ncritics and provide his party managers with an effective platform cry to\r\ndrown the increasing voices of criticism from other quarters.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the General Election of 1918 affords a sad, dramatic\r\nhistory of the essential weakness of one who draws his chief inspiration\r\nnot from his own true impulses, but from the grosser effluxions of the\r\natmosphere which momentarily surrounds him. The Prime Minister's natural\r\ninstincts, as they so often are, were right and reasonable. He himself\r\ndid not believe in hanging the Kaiser or in the wisdom or the\r\npossibility of a great indemnity. On the 22nd of November he and Mr.\r\nBonar Law issued their Election Manifesto. It contains no allusion of\r\nany kind either to the one or to the other but, speaking, rather, of\r\nDisarmament and the League of Nations, concludes that \"our first task\r\nmust be to conclude a just and lasting peace, and so to establish the\r\nfoundations of a new Europe that occasion for further wars may be for\r\never averted.\" In his speech at Wolverhampton on the eve of the\r\nDissolution (November 24), there is no word of Reparation or Indemnity.\r\nOn the following day at Glasgow, Mr. Bonar Law would promise nothing.\r\n\"We are going to the Conference,\" he said, \"as one of a number of\r\nallies, and you cannot expect a member of the Government, whatever he\r\nmay think, to state in public before he goes into that Conference, what\r\nline he is going to take in regard to any particular question.\" But a\r\nfew days later at Newcastle (November 29) the Prime Minister was warming\r\nto his work: \"When Germany defeated France she made France pay. That is\r\nthe principle which she herself has established. There is absolutely no\r\ndoubt about the principle, and that is the principle we should proceed\r\nupon--that Germany must pay the costs of the war up to the limit of her\r\ncapacity to do so.\" But he accompanied this statement of principle with\r\nmany \"words of warning\" as to the practical difficulties of the case:\r\n\"We have appointed a strong Committee of experts, representing every\r\nshade of opinion, to consider this question very carefully and to advise\r\nus. There is no doubt as to the justice of the demand. She ought to pay,\r\nshe must pay as far as she can, but we are not going to allow her to pay\r\nin such a way as to wreck our industries.\" At this stage the Prime\r\nMinister sought to indicate that he intended great severity, without\r\nraising excessive hopes of actually getting the money, or committing\r\nhimself to a particular line of action at the Conference. It was\r\nrumored that a high city authority had committed himself to the opinion\r\nthat Germany could certainly pay $100,000,000,000 and that this\r\nauthority for his part would not care to discredit a figure of twice\r\nthat sum. The Treasury officials, as Mr. Lloyd George indicated, took a\r\ndifferent view. He could, therefore, shelter himself behind the wide\r\ndiscrepancy between the opinions of his different advisers, and regard\r\nthe precise figure of Germany's capacity to pay as an open question in\r\nthe treatment of which he must do his best for his country's interests.\r\nAs to our engagements under the Fourteen Points he was always silent.\r\n\r\nOn November 30, Mr. Barnes, a member of the War Cabinet, in which he was\r\nsupposed to represent Labor, shouted from a platform, \"I am for hanging\r\nthe Kaiser.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 6, the Prime Minister issued a statement of policy and aims\r\nin which he stated, with significant emphasis on the word _European_,\r\nthat \"All the European Allies have accepted the principle that the\r\nCentral Powers must pay the cost of the war up to the limit of their\r\ncapacity.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was now little more than a week to Polling Day, and still he had\r\nnot said enough to satisfy the appetites of the moment. On December 8,\r\nthe _Times_, providing as usual a cloak of ostensible decorum for the\r\nlesser restraint of its associates, declared in a leader entitled\r\n\"Making Germany Pay,\" that \"The public mind was still bewildered by the\r\nPrime Minister's various statements.\" \"There is too much suspicion,\"\r\nthey added, \"of influences concerned to let the Germans off lightly,\r\nwhereas the only possible motive in determining their capacity to pay\r\nmust be the interests of the Allies.\" \"It is the candidate who deals\r\nwith the issues of to-day,\" wrote their Political Correspondent, \"who\r\nadopts Mr. Barnes's phrase about 'hanging the Kaiser' and plumps for the\r\npayment of the cost of the war by Germany, who rouses his audience and\r\nstrikes the notes to which they are most responsive.\"\r\n\r\nOn December 9, at the Queen's Hall, the Prime Minister avoided the\r\nsubject. But from now on, the debauchery of thought and speech\r\nprogressed hour by hour. The grossest spectacle was provided by Sir Eric\r\nGeddes in the Guildhall at Cambridge. An earlier speech in which, in a\r\nmoment of injudicious candor, he had cast doubts on the possibility of\r\nextracting from Germany the whole cost of the war had been the object of\r\nserious suspicion, and he had therefore a reputation to regain. \"We will\r\nget out of her all you can squeeze out of a lemon and a bit more,\" the\r\npenitent shouted, \"I will squeeze her until you can hear the pips\r\nsqueak\"; his policy was to take every bit of property belonging to\r\nGermans in neutral and Allied countries, and all her gold and silver and\r\nher jewels, and the contents of her picture-galleries and libraries, to\r\nsell the proceeds for the Allies' benefit. \"I would strip Germany,\" he\r\ncried, \"as she has stripped Belgium.\"\r\n\r\nBy December 11 the Prime Minister had capitulated. His Final Manifesto\r\nof Six Points issued on that day to the electorate furnishes a\r\nmelancholy comparison with his program of three weeks earlier. I quote\r\nit in full:\r\n\r\n    \"1. Trial of the Kaiser.\r\n     2. Punishment of those responsible for atrocities.\r\n     3. Fullest Indemnities from Germany.\r\n     4. Britain for the British, socially and industrially.\r\n     5. Rehabilitation of those broken in the war.\r\n     6. A happier country for all.\"\r\n\r\nHere is food for the cynic. To this concoction of greed and sentiment,\r\nprejudice and deception, three weeks of the platform had reduced the\r\npowerful governors of England, who but a little while before had spoken\r\nnot ignobly of Disarmament and a League of Nations and of a just and\r\nlasting peace which should establish the foundations of a new Europe.\r\n\r\nOn the same evening the Prime Minister at Bristol withdrew in effect his\r\nprevious reservations and laid down four principles to govern his\r\nIndemnity Policy, of which the chief were: First, we have an absolute\r\nright to demand the whole cost of the war; second, we propose to demand\r\nthe whole cost of the war; and third, a Committee appointed by direction\r\nof the Cabinet believe that it can be done.[100] Four days later he went\r\nto the polls.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister never said that he himself believed that Germany\r\ncould pay the whole cost of the war. But the program became in the\r\nmouths of his supporters on the hustings a great deal more than\r\nconcrete. The ordinary voter was led to believe that Germany could\r\ncertainly be made to pay the greater part, if not the whole cost of the\r\nwar. Those whose practical and selfish fears for the future the expenses\r\nof the war had aroused, and those whose emotions its horrors had\r\ndisordered, were both provided for. A vote for a Coalition candidate\r\nmeant the Crucifixion of Anti-Christ and the assumption by Germany of\r\nthe British National Debt.\r\n\r\nIt proved an irresistible combination, and once more Mr. George's\r\npolitical instinct was not at fault. No candidate could safely denounce\r\nthis program, and none did so. The old Liberal Party, having nothing\r\ncomparable to offer to the electorate, was swept out of existence.[101]\r\nA new House of Commons came into being, a majority of whose members had\r\npledged themselves to a great deal more than the Prime Minister's\r\nguarded promises. Shortly after their arrival at Westminster I asked a\r\nConservative friend, who had known previous Houses, what he thought of\r\nthem. \"They are a lot of hard-faced men,\" he said, \"who look as if they\r\nhad done very well out of the war.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the atmosphere in which the Prime Minister left for Paris, and\r\nthese the entanglements he had made for himself. He had pledged himself\r\nand his Government to make demands of a helpless enemy inconsistent with\r\nsolemn engagements on our part, on the faith of which this enemy had\r\nlaid down his arms. There are few episodes in history which posterity\r\nwill have less reason to condone,--a war ostensibly waged in defense of\r\nthe sanctity of international engagements ending in a definite breach of\r\none of the most sacred possible of such engagements on the part of\r\nvictorious champions of these ideals.[102]\r\n\r\nApart from other aspects of the transaction, I believe that the\r\ncampaign for securing out of Germany the general costs of the war was\r\none of the most serious acts of political unwisdom for which our\r\nstatesmen have ever been responsible. To what a different future Europe\r\nmight have looked forward if either Mr. Lloyd George or Mr. Wilson had\r\napprehended that the most serious of the problems which claimed their\r\nattention were not political or territorial but financial and economic,\r\nand that the perils of the future lay not in frontiers or sovereignties\r\nbut in food, coal, and transport. Neither of them paid adequate\r\nattention to these problems at any stage of the Conference. But in any\r\nevent the atmosphere for the wise and reasonable consideration of them\r\nwas hopelessly befogged by the commitments of the British delegation on\r\nthe question of Indemnities. The hopes to which the Prime Minister had\r\ngiven rise not only compelled him to advocate an unjust and unworkable\r\neconomic basis to the Treaty with Germany, but set him at variance with\r\nthe President, and on the other hand with competing interests to those\r\nof France and Belgium. The clearer it became that but little could be\r\nexpected from Germany, the more necessary it was to exercise patriotic\r\ngreed and \"sacred egotism\" and snatch the bone from the juster claims\r\nand greater need of France or the well-founded expectations of Belgium.\r\nYet the financial problems which were about to exercise Europe could not\r\nbe solved by greed. The possibility of _their_ cure lay in magnanimity.\r\n\r\nEurope, if she is to survive her troubles, will need so much magnanimity\r\nfrom America, that she must herself practice it. It is useless for the\r\nAllies, hot from stripping Germany and one another, to turn for help to\r\nthe United States to put the States of Europe, including Germany, on to\r\ntheir feet again. If the General Election of December, 1918, had been\r\nfought on lines of prudent generosity instead of imbecile greed, how\r\nmuch better the financial prospect of Europe might now be. I still\r\nbelieve that before the main Conference, or very early in its\r\nproceedings, the representatives of Great Britain should have entered\r\ndeeply, with those of the United States, into the economic and financial\r\nsituation as a whole, and that the former should have been authorized to\r\nmake concrete proposals on the general lines (1) that all inter-allied\r\nindebtedness be canceled outright; (2) that the sum to be paid by\r\nGermany be fixed at $10,000,000,000; (3) that Great Britain renounce all\r\nclaim to participation in this sum and that any share to which she\r\nproves entitled be placed at the disposal of the Conference for the\r\npurpose of aiding the finances of the New States about to be\r\nestablished; (4) that in order to make some basis of credit immediately\r\navailable an appropriate proportion of the German obligations\r\nrepresenting the sum to be paid by her should be guaranteed by all\r\nparties to the Treaty; and (5) that the ex-enemy Powers should also be\r\nallowed, with a view to their economic restoration, to issue a moderate\r\namount of bonds carrying a similar guarantee. Such proposals involved an\r\nappeal to the generosity of the United States. But that was inevitable;\r\nand, in view of her far less financial sacrifices, it was an appeal\r\nwhich could fairly have been made to her. Such proposals would have been\r\npracticable. There is nothing in them quixotic or Utopian. And they\r\nwould have opened up for Europe some prospect of financial stability and\r\nreconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe further elaboration of these ideas, however, must be left to Chapter\r\nVII., and we must return to Paris. I have described the entanglements\r\nwhich Mr. Lloyd George took with him. The position of the Finance\r\nMinisters of the other Allies was even worse. We in Great Britain had\r\nnot based our financial arrangements on any expectations of an\r\nindemnity. Receipts from such a source would have been more or less in\r\nthe nature of a windfall; and, in spite of subsequent developments,\r\nthere was an expectation at that time of balancing our budget by normal\r\nmethods. But this was not the case with France or Italy. Their peace\r\nbudgets made no pretense of balancing and had no prospects of doing so,\r\nwithout some far-reaching revision of the existing policy. Indeed, the\r\nposition was and remains nearly hopeless. These countries were heading\r\nfor national bankruptcy. This fact could only be concealed by holding\r\nout the expectation of vast receipts from the enemy. As soon as it was\r\nadmitted that it was in fact impossible to make Germany pay the expenses\r\nof both sides, and that the unloading of their liabilities upon the\r\nenemy was not practicable, the position of the Ministers of Finance of\r\nFrance and Italy became untenable.\r\n\r\nThus a scientific consideration of Germany's capacity to pay was from\r\nthe outset out of court. The expectations which the exigencies of\r\npolitics had made it necessary to raise were so very remote from the\r\ntruth that a slight distortion of figures was no use, and it was\r\nnecessary to ignore the facts entirely. The resulting unveracity was\r\nfundamental. On a basis of so much falsehood it became impossible to\r\nerect any constructive financial policy which was workable. For this\r\nreason amongst others, a magnanimous financial policy was essential. The\r\nfinancial position of France and Italy was so bad that it was impossible\r\nto make them listen to reason on the subject of the German Indemnity,\r\nunless one could at the same time point out to them some alternative\r\nmode of escape from their troubles.[103] The representatives of the\r\nUnited States were greatly at fault, in my judgment, for having no\r\nconstructive proposals whatever to offer to a suffering and distracted\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nIt is worth while to point out in passing a further element in the\r\nsituation, namely, the opposition which existed between the \"crushing\"\r\npolicy of M. Clemenceau and the financial necessities of M. Klotz.\r\nClemenceau's aim was to weaken and destroy Germany in every possible\r\nway, and I fancy that he was always a little contemptuous about the\r\nIndemnity; he had no intention of leaving Germany in a position to\r\npractise a vast commercial activity. But he did not trouble his head to\r\nunderstand either the indemnity or poor M. Klotz's overwhelming\r\nfinancial difficulties. If it amused the financiers to put into the\r\nTreaty some very large demands, well there was no harm in that; but the\r\nsatisfaction of these demands must not be allowed to interfere with the\r\nessential requirements of a Carthaginian Peace. The combination of the\r\n\"real\" policy of M. Clemenceau on unreal issues, with M. Klotz's policy\r\nof pretense on what were very real issues indeed, introduced into the\r\nTreaty a whole set of incompatible provisions, over and above the\r\ninherent impracticabilities of the Reparation proposals.\r\n\r\nI cannot here describe the endless controversy and intrigue between the\r\nAllies themselves, which at last after some months culminated in the\r\npresentation to Germany of the Reparation Chapter in its final form.\r\nThere can have been few negotiations in history so contorted, so\r\nmiserable, so utterly unsatisfactory to all parties. I doubt if any one\r\nwho took much part in that debate can look back on it without shame. I\r\nmust be content with an analysis of the elements of the final compromise\r\nwhich is known to all the world.\r\n\r\nThe main point to be settled was, of course, that of the items for which\r\nGermany could fairly be asked to make payment. Mr. Lloyd George's\r\nelection pledge to the effect that the Allies were _entitled_ to demand\r\nfrom Germany the entire costs of the war was from the outset clearly\r\nuntenable; or rather, to put it more impartially, it was clear that to\r\npersuade the President of the conformity of this demand with our\r\npro-Armistice engagements was beyond the powers of the most plausible.\r\nThe actual compromise finally reached is to be read as follows in the\r\nparagraphs of the Treaty as it has been published to the world.\r\n\r\nArticle 231 reads: \"The Allied and Associated Governments affirm and\r\nGermany accepts the responsibility of Germany and her allies for causing\r\nall the loss and damage to which the Allied and Associated Governments\r\nand their nationals have been subjected as a consequence of the war\r\nimposed upon them by the aggression of Germany and her allies.\" This is\r\na well and carefully drafted Article; for the President could read it as\r\nstatement of admission on Germany's part of _moral_ responsibility for\r\nbringing about the war, while the Prime Minister could explain it as an\r\nadmission of _financial_ liability for the general costs of the war.\r\nArticle 232 continues: \"The Allied and Associated Governments recognize\r\nthat the resources of Germany are not adequate, after taking into\r\naccount permanent diminutions of such resources which will result from\r\nother provisions of the present Treaty, to make complete reparation for\r\nall such loss and damage.\" The President could comfort himself that this\r\nwas no more than a statement of undoubted fact, and that to recognize\r\nthat Germany _cannot_ pay a certain claim does not imply that she is\r\n_liable_ to pay the claim; but the Prime Minister could point out that\r\nin the context it emphasizes to the reader the assumption of Germany's\r\ntheoretic liability asserted in the preceding Article. Article 232\r\nproceeds: \"The Allied and Associated Governments, however, require, and\r\nGermany undertakes, that _she will make compensation for all damage done\r\nto the civilian population of the Allied and Associated Powers and to\r\ntheir property_ during the period of the belligerency of each as an\r\nAllied or Associated Power against Germany _by such aggression by land,\r\nby sea, and from the air_, and in general all damage as defined in Annex\r\nI. hereto.\"[104] The words italicized being practically a quotation from\r\nthe pre-Armistice conditions, satisfied the scruples of the President,\r\nwhile the addition of the words \"and in general all damage as defined in\r\nAnnex I. hereto\" gave the Prime Minister a chance in Annex I.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, all this is only a matter of words, of virtuosity in\r\ndraftsmanship, which does no one any harm, and which probably seemed\r\nmuch more important at the time than it ever will again between now and\r\nJudgment Day. For substance we must turn to Annex I.\r\n\r\nA great part of Annex I. is in strict conformity with the pre-Armistice\r\nconditions, or, at any rate, does not strain them beyond what is fairly\r\narguable. Paragraph 1 claims damage done for injury to the persons of\r\ncivilians, or, in the case of death, to their dependents, as a direct\r\nconsequence of acts of war; Paragraph 2, for acts of cruelty, violence,\r\nor maltreatment on the part of the enemy towards civilian victims;\r\nParagraph 3, for enemy acts injurious to health or capacity to work or\r\nto honor towards civilians in occupied or invaded territory; Paragraph\r\n8, for forced labor exacted by the enemy from civilians; Paragraph 9,\r\nfor damage done to property \"with the exception of naval and military\r\nworks or materials\" as a direct consequence of hostilities; and\r\nParagraph 10, for fines and levies imposed by the enemy upon the\r\ncivilian population. All these demands are just and in conformity with\r\nthe Allies' rights.\r\n\r\nParagraph 4, which claims for \"damage caused by any kind of maltreatment\r\nof prisoners of war,\" is more doubtful on the strict letter, but may be\r\njustifiable under the Hague Convention and involves a very small sum.\r\n\r\nIn Paragraphs 5, 6, and 7, however, an issue of immensely greater\r\nsignificance is involved. These paragraphs assert a claim for the amount\r\nof the Separation and similar Allowances granted during the war by the\r\nAllied Governments to the families of mobilized persons, and for the\r\namount of the pensions and compensations in respect of the injury or\r\ndeath of combatants payable by these Governments now and hereafter.\r\nFinancially this adds to the Bill, as we shall see below, a very large\r\namount, indeed about twice as much again as all the other claims added\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe reader will readily apprehend what a plausible case can be made out\r\nfor the inclusion of these items of damage, if only on sentimental\r\ngrounds. It can be pointed out, first of all, that from the point of\r\nview of general fairness it is monstrous that a woman whose house is\r\ndestroyed should be entitled to claim from the enemy whilst a woman\r\nwhose husband is killed on the field of battle should not be so\r\nentitled; or that a farmer deprived of his farm should claim but that a\r\nwoman deprived of the earning power of her husband should not claim. In\r\nfact the case for including Pensions and Separation Allowances largely\r\ndepends on exploiting the rather _arbitrary_ character of the criterion\r\nlaid down in the pre-Armistice conditions. Of all the losses caused by\r\nwar some bear more heavily on individuals and some are more evenly\r\ndistributed over the community as a whole; but by means of compensations\r\ngranted by the Government many of the former are in fact converted into\r\nthe latter. The most logical criterion for a limited claim, falling\r\nshort of the entire costs of the war, would have been in respect of\r\nenemy acts contrary to International engagements or the recognized\r\npractices of warfare. But this also would have been very difficult to\r\napply and unduly unfavorable to French interests as compared with\r\nBelgium (whose neutrality Germany had guaranteed) and Great Britain (the\r\nchief sufferer from illicit acts of submarines).\r\n\r\nIn any case the appeals to sentiment and fairness outlined above are\r\nhollow; for it makes no difference to the recipient of a separation\r\nallowance or a pension whether the State which pays them receives\r\ncompensation on this or on another head, and a recovery by the State out\r\nof indemnity receipts is just as much in relief of the general taxpayer\r\nas a contribution towards the general costs of the war would have been.\r\nBut the main consideration is that it was too late to consider whether\r\nthe pre-Armistice conditions were perfectly judicious and logical or to\r\namend them; the only question at issue was whether these conditions were\r\nnot in fact limited to such classes of direct damage to civilians and\r\ntheir property as are set forth in Paragraphs 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, and 10 of\r\nAnnex I. If words have any meaning, or engagements any force, we had no\r\nmore right to claim for those war expenses of the State, which arose out\r\nof Pensions and Separation Allowances, than for any other of the general\r\ncosts of the war. And who is prepared to argue in detail that we were\r\nentitled to demand the latter?\r\n\r\nWhat had really happened was a compromise between the Prime Minister's\r\npledge to the British electorate to claim the entire costs of the war\r\nand the pledge to the contrary which the Allies had given to Germany at\r\nthe Armistice. The Prime Minister could claim that although he had not\r\nsecured the entire costs of the war, he had nevertheless secured an\r\nimportant contribution towards them, that he had always qualified his\r\npromises by the limiting condition of Germany's capacity to pay, and\r\nthat the bill as now presented more than exhausted this capacity as\r\nestimated by the more sober authorities. The President, on the other\r\nhand, had secured a formula, which was not too obvious a breach of\r\nfaith, and had avoided a quarrel with his Associates on an issue where\r\nthe appeals to sentiment and passion would all have been against him, in\r\nthe event of its being made a matter of open popular controversy. In\r\nview of the Prime Minister's election pledges, the President could\r\nhardly hope to get him to abandon them in their entirety without a\r\nstruggle in public; and the cry of pensions would have had an\r\noverwhelming popular appeal in all countries. Once more the Prime\r\nMinister had shown himself a political tactician of a high order.\r\n\r\nA further point of great difficulty may be readily perceived between the\r\nlines of the Treaty. It fixes no definite sum as representing Germany's\r\nliability. This feature has been the subject of very general\r\ncriticism,--that it is equally inconvenient to Germany and to the Allies\r\nthemselves that she should not know what she has to pay or they what\r\nthey are to receive. The method, apparently contemplated by the Treaty,\r\nof arriving at the final result over a period of many months by an\r\naddition of hundreds of thousands of individual claims for damage to\r\nland, farm buildings, and chickens, is evidently impracticable; and the\r\nreasonable course would have been for both parties to compound for a\r\nround sum without examination of details. If this round sum had been\r\nnamed in the Treaty, the settlement would have been placed on a more\r\nbusiness-like basis.\r\n\r\nBut this was impossible for two reasons. Two different kinds of false\r\nstatements had been widely promulgated, one as to Germany's capacity to\r\npay, the other as to the amount of the Allies' just claims in respect of\r\nthe devastated areas. The fixing of either of these figures presented a\r\ndilemma. A figure for Germany's prospective capacity to pay, not too\r\nmuch in excess of the estimates of most candid and well-informed\r\nauthorities, would have fallen hopelessly far short of popular\r\nexpectations both in England and in France. On the other hand, a\r\ndefinitive figure for damage done which would not disastrously\r\ndisappoint the expectations which had been raised in France and Belgium\r\nmight have been incapable of substantiation under challenge,[105] and\r\nopen to damaging criticism on the part of the Germans, who were believed\r\nto have been prudent enough to accumulate considerable evidence as to\r\nthe extent of their own misdoings.\r\n\r\nBy far the safest course for the politicians was, therefore, to mention\r\nno figure at all; and from this necessity a great deal of the\r\ncomplication of the Reparation Chapter essentially springs.\r\n\r\nThe reader may be interested, however, to have my estimate of the claim\r\nwhich can in fact be substantiated under Annex I. of the Reparation\r\nChapter. In the first section of this chapter I have already guessed the\r\nclaims other than those for Pensions and Separation Allowances at\r\n$15,000,000,000 (to take the extreme upper limit of my estimate). The\r\nclaim for Pensions and Separation Allowances under Annex I. is not to be\r\nbased on the _actual_ cost of these compensations to the Governments\r\nconcerned, but is to be a computed figure calculated on the basis of the\r\nscales in force in France at the date of the Treaty's coming into\r\noperation. This method avoids the invidious course of valuing an\r\nAmerican or a British life at a higher figure than a French or an\r\nItalian. The French rate for Pensions and Allowances is at an\r\nintermediate rate, not so high as the American or British, but above the\r\nItalian, the Belgian, or the Serbian. The only data required for the\r\ncalculation are the actual French rates and the numbers of men mobilized\r\nand of the casualties in each class of the various Allied Armies. None\r\nof these figures are available in detail, but enough is known of the\r\ngeneral level of allowances, of the numbers involved, and of the\r\ncasualties suffered to allow of an estimate which may not be _very wide_\r\nof the mark. My guess as to the amount to be added in respect of\r\nPensions and Allowances is as follows:\r\n\r\n    British Empire                 $ 7,000,000,000[106]\r\n    France                          12,000,000,000[106]\r\n    Italy                            2,500,000,000\r\n    Others (including United States) 3,500,000,000\r\n                                   ---------------\r\n    Total                         $ 25,000,000,000\r\n\r\nI feel much more confidence in the approximate accuracy of the total\r\nfigure[107] than in its division between the different claimants. The\r\nreader will observe that in any case the addition of Pensions and\r\nAllowances enormously increases the aggregate claim, raising it indeed\r\nby nearly double. Adding this figure to the estimate under other heads,\r\nwe have a total claim against Germany of $40,000,000,000.[108] I believe\r\nthat this figure is fully high enough, and that the actual result may\r\nfall somewhat short of it.[109] In the next section of this chapter the\r\nrelation of this figure to Germany's capacity to pay will be examined.\r\nIt is only necessary here to remind the reader of certain other\r\nparticulars of the Treaty which speak for themselves:\r\n\r\n1. Out of the total amount of the claim, whatever it eventually turns\r\nout to be, a sum of $5,000,000,000 must be paid before May 1, 1921. The\r\npossibility of this will be discussed below. But the Treaty itself\r\nprovides certain abatements. In the first place, this sum is to include\r\nthe expenses of the Armies of Occupation since the Armistice (a large\r\ncharge of the order of magnitude of $1,000,000,000 which under another\r\nArticle of the Treaty--No. 249--is laid upon Germany).[110] But further,\r\n\"such supplies of food and raw materials as may be judged by the\r\nGovernments of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers to be\r\nessential to enable Germany to meet her obligations for Reparation may\r\nalso, with the approval of the said Governments, be paid for out of the\r\nabove sum.\"[111] This is a qualification of high importance. The clause,\r\nas it is drafted, allows the Finance Ministers of the Allied countries\r\nto hold out to their electorates the hope of substantial payments at an\r\nearly date, while at the same time it gives to the Reparation Commission\r\na discretion, which the force of facts will compel them to exercise, to\r\ngive back to Germany what is required for the maintenance of her\r\neconomic existence. This discretionary power renders the demand for an\r\nimmediate payment of $5,000,000,000 less injurious than it would\r\notherwise be, but nevertheless it does not render it innocuous. In the\r\nfirst place, my conclusions in the next section of this chapter indicate\r\nthat this sum cannot be found within the period indicated, even if a\r\nlarge proportion is in practice returned to Germany for the purpose of\r\nenabling her to pay for imports. In the second place, the Reparation\r\nCommission can only exercise its discretionary power effectively by\r\ntaking charge of the entire foreign trade of Germany, together with the\r\nforeign exchange arising out of it, which will be quite beyond the\r\ncapacity of any such body. If the Reparation Commission makes any\r\nserious attempt to administer the collection of this sum of\r\n$5,000,000,000 and to authorize the return to Germany of a part it, the\r\ntrade of Central Europe will be strangled by bureaucratic regulation in\r\nits most inefficient form.\r\n\r\n2. In addition to the early payment in cash or kind of a sum of\r\n$5,000,000,000, Germany is required to deliver bearer bonds to a further\r\namount of $10,000,000,000, or, in the event of the payments in cash or\r\nkind before May 1, 1921, available for Reparation, falling short of\r\n$5,000,000,000 by reason of the permitted deductions, to such further\r\namount as shall bring the total payments by Germany in cash, kind, and\r\nbearer bonds up to May 1, 1921, to a figure of $15,000,000,000\r\naltogether.[112] These bearer bonds carry interest at 2-1/2 per cent per\r\nannum from 1921 to 1925, and at 5 per cent _plus_ 1 per cent for\r\namortization thereafter. Assuming, therefore, that Germany is not able\r\nto provide any appreciable surplus towards Reparation before 1921, she\r\nwill have to find a sum of $375,000,000 annually from 1921 to 1925, and\r\n$900,000,000 annually thereafter.[113]\r\n\r\n3. As soon as the Reparation Commission is satisfied that Germany can do\r\nbetter than this, 5 per cent bearer bonds are to be issued for a further\r\n$10,000,000,000, the rate of amortization being determined by the\r\nCommission hereafter. This would bring the annual payment to\r\n$1,400,000,000 without allowing anything for the discharge of the\r\ncapital of the last $10,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n4. Germany's liability, however, is not limited to $25,000,000,000, and\r\nthe Reparation Commission is to demand further instalments of bearer\r\nbonds until the total enemy liability under Annex I. has been provided\r\nfor. On the basis of my estimate of $40,000,000,000 for the total\r\nliability, which is more likely to be criticized as being too low than\r\nas being too high, the amount of this balance will be $15,000,000,000.\r\nAssuming interest at 5 per cent, this will raise the annual payment to\r\n$2,150,000,000 without allowance for amortization.\r\n\r\n5. But even this is not all. There is a further provision of devastating\r\nsignificance. Bonds representing payments in excess of $15,000,000,000\r\nare not to be issued until the Commission is satisfied that Germany can\r\nmeet the interest on them. But this does not mean that interest is\r\nremitted in the meantime. As from May 1, 1921, interest is to be debited\r\nto Germany on such part of her outstanding debt as has not been covered\r\nby payment in cash or kind or by the issue of bonds as above,[114] and\r\n\"the rate of interest shall be 5 per cent unless the Commission shall\r\ndetermine at some future time that circumstances justify a variation of\r\nthis rate.\" That is to say, the capital sum of indebtedness is rolling\r\nup all the time at compound interest. The effect of this provision\r\ntowards increasing the burden is, on the assumption that Germany cannot\r\npay very large sums at first, enormous. At 5 per cent compound interest\r\na capital sum doubles itself in fifteen years. On the assumption that\r\nGermany cannot pay more than $750,000,000 annually until 1936 (_i.e._ 5\r\nper cent interest on $15,000,000,000) the $25,000,000,000 on which\r\ninterest is deferred will have risen to $50,000,000,000, carrying an\r\nannual interest charge of $2,500,000,000. That is to say, even if\r\nGermany pays $750,000,000 annually up to 1936, she will nevertheless owe\r\nus at that date more than half as much again as she does now\r\n($65,000,000,000 as compared with $40,000,000,000). From 1936 onwards\r\nshe will have to pay to us $3,250,000,000 annually in order to keep pace\r\nwith the interest alone. At the end of any year in which she pays less\r\nthan this sum she will owe more than she did at the beginning of it. And\r\nif she is to discharge the capital sum in thirty years from 1930, _i.e._\r\nin forty-eight years from the Armistice, she must pay an additional\r\n$650,000,000 annually, making $3,900,000,000 in all.[115]\r\n\r\nIt is, in my judgment, as certain as anything can be, for reasons which\r\nI will elaborate in a moment, that Germany cannot pay anything\r\napproaching this sum. Until the Treaty is altered, therefore, Germany\r\nhas in effect engaged herself to hand over to the Allies the whole of\r\nher surplus production in perpetuity.\r\n\r\n6. This is not less the case because the Reparation Commission has been\r\ngiven discretionary powers to vary the rate of interest, and to postpone\r\nand even to cancel the capital indebtedness. In the first place, some of\r\nthese powers can only be exercised if the Commission or the Governments\r\nrepresented on it are _unanimous_.[116] But also, which is perhaps more\r\nimportant, it will be the _duty_ of the Reparation Commission, until\r\nthere has been a unanimous and far-reaching change of the policy which\r\nthe Treaty represents, to extract from Germany year after year the\r\nmaximum sum obtainable. There is a great difference between fixing a\r\ndefinite sum, which though large is within Germany's capacity to pay and\r\nyet to retain a little for herself, and fixing a sum far beyond her\r\ncapacity, which is then to be reduced at the discretion of a foreign\r\nCommission acting with the object of obtaining each year the maximum\r\nwhich the circumstances of that year permit. The first still leaves her\r\nwith some slight incentive for enterprise, energy, and hope. The latter\r\nskins her alive year by year in perpetuity, and however skilfully and\r\ndiscreetly the operation is performed, with whatever regard for not\r\nkilling the patient in the process, it would represent a policy which,\r\nif it were really entertained and deliberately practised, the judgment\r\nof men would soon pronounce to be one of the most outrageous acts of a\r\ncruel victor in civilized history.\r\n\r\nThere are other functions and powers of high significance which the\r\nTreaty accords to the Reparation Commission. But these will be most\r\nconveniently dealt with in a separate section.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. _Germany's Capacity to pay_\r\n\r\nThe forms in which Germany can discharge the sum which she has engaged\r\nherself to pay are three in number--\r\n\r\n1. Immediately transferable wealth in the form of gold, ships, and\r\nforeign securities;\r\n\r\n2. The value of property in ceded territory, or surrendered under the\r\nArmistice;\r\n\r\n3. Annual payments spread over a term of years, partly in cash and\r\npartly in materials such as coal products, potash, and dyes.\r\n\r\nThere is excluded from the above the actual restitution of property\r\nremoved from territory occupied by the enemy, as, for example, Russian\r\ngold, Belgian and French securities, cattle, machinery, and works of\r\nart. In so far as the actual goods taken can be identified and restored,\r\nthey must clearly be returned to their rightful owners, and cannot be\r\nbrought into the general reparation pool. This is expressly provided for\r\nin Article 238 of the Treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Immediately Transferable Wealth_\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Gold_.--After deduction of the gold to be returned to Russia, the\r\nofficial holding of gold as shown in the Reichsbank's return of the 30th\r\nNovember, 1918, amounted to $577,089,500. This was a very much larger\r\namount than had appeared in the Reichsbank's return prior to the\r\nwar,[117] and was the result of the vigorous campaign carried on in\r\nGermany during the war for the surrender to the Reichsbank not only of\r\ngold coin but of gold ornaments of every kind. Private hoards doubtless\r\nstill exist, but, in view of the great efforts already made, it is\r\nunlikely that either the German Government or the Allies will be able to\r\nunearth them. The return can therefore be taken as probably representing\r\nthe maximum amount which the German Government are able to extract from\r\ntheir people. In addition to gold there was in the Reichsbank a sum of\r\nabout $5,000,000 in silver. There must be, however, a further\r\nsubstantial amount in circulation, for the holdings of the Reichsbank\r\nwere as high as $45,500,000 on the 31st December, 1917, and stood at\r\nabout $30,000,000 up to the latter part of October, 1918, when the\r\ninternal run began on currency of every kind.[118] We may, therefore,\r\ntake a total of (say) $625,000,000 for gold and silver together at the\r\ndate of the Armistice.\r\n\r\nThese reserves, however, are no longer intact. During the long period\r\nwhich elapsed between the Armistice and the Peace it became necessary\r\nfor the Allies to facilitate the provisioning of Germany from abroad.\r\nThe political condition of Germany at that time and the serious menace\r\nof Spartacism rendered this step necessary in the interests of the\r\nAllies themselves if they desired the continuance in Germany of a stable\r\nGovernment to treat with. The question of how such provisions were to be\r\npaid for presented, however, the gravest difficulties. A series of\r\nConferences was held at TrËves, at Spa, at Brussels, and subsequently at\r\nCh‚teau Villette and Versailles, between representatives of the Allies\r\nand of Germany, with the object of finding some method of payment as\r\nlittle injurious as possible to the future prospects of Reparation\r\npayments. The German representatives maintained from the outset that the\r\nfinancial exhaustion of their country was for the time being so complete\r\nthat a temporary loan from the Allies was the only possible expedient.\r\nThis the Allies could hardly admit at a time when they were preparing\r\ndemands for the immediate payment by Germany of immeasurably larger\r\nsums. But, apart from this, the German claim could not be accepted as\r\nstrictly accurate so long as their gold was still untapped and their\r\nremaining foreign securities unmarketed. In any case, it was out of the\r\nquestion to suppose that in the spring of 1919 public opinion in the\r\nAllied countries or in America would have allowed the grant of a\r\nsubstantial loan to Germany. On the other hand, the Allies were\r\nnaturally reluctant to exhaust on the provisioning of Germany the gold\r\nwhich seemed to afford one of the few obvious and certain sources for\r\nReparation. Much time was expended in the exploration of all possible\r\nalternatives; but it was evident at last that, even if German exports\r\nand saleable foreign securities had been available to a sufficient\r\nvalue, they could not be liquidated in time, and that the financial\r\nexhaustion of Germany was so complete that nothing whatever was\r\nimmediately available in substantial amounts except the gold in the\r\nReichsbank. Accordingly a sum exceeding $250,000,000 in all out of the\r\nReichsbank gold was transferred by Germany to the Allies (chiefly to the\r\nUnited States, Great Britain, however, also receiving a substantial sum)\r\nduring the first six months of 1919 in payment for foodstuffs.\r\n\r\nBut this was not all. Although Germany agreed, under the first extension\r\nof the Armistice, not to export gold without Allied permission, this\r\npermission could not be always withheld. There were liabilities of the\r\nReichsbank accruing in the neighboring neutral countries, which could\r\nnot be met otherwise than in gold. The failure of the Reichsbank to meet\r\nits liabilities would have caused a depreciation of the exchange so\r\ninjurious to Germany's credit as to react on the future prospects of\r\nReparation. In some cases, therefore, permission to export gold was\r\naccorded to the Reichsbank by the Supreme Economic Council of the\r\nAllies.\r\n\r\nThe net result of these various measures was to reduce the gold reserve\r\nof the Reichsbank by more than half, the figures falling from\r\n$575,000,000 to $275,000,000 in September, 1919.\r\n\r\nIt would be _possible_ under the Treaty to take the whole of this latter\r\nsum for Reparation purposes. It amounts, however, as it is, to less\r\nthan 4 per cent of the Reichsbank's Note Issue, and the psychological\r\neffect of its total confiscation might be expected (having regard to the\r\nvery large volume of mark notes held abroad) to destroy the exchange\r\nvalue of the mark almost entirely. A sum of $25,000,000, $50,000,000, or\r\neven $100,000,000 might be taken for a special purpose. But we may\r\nassume that the Reparation Commission will judge it imprudent, having\r\nregard to the reaction on their future prospects of securing payment, to\r\nruin the German currency system altogether, more particularly because\r\nthe French and Belgian Governments, being holders of a very large volume\r\nof mark notes formerly circulating in the occupied or ceded territory,\r\nhave a great interest in maintaining some exchange value for the mark,\r\nquite apart from Reparation prospects.\r\n\r\nIt follows, therefore, that no sum worth speaking of can be expected in\r\nthe form of gold or silver towards the initial payment of $5,000,000,000\r\ndue by 1921.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Shipping_.--Germany has engaged, as we have seen above, to\r\nsurrender to the Allies virtually the whole of her merchant shipping. A\r\nconsiderable part of it, indeed, was already in the hands of the Allies\r\nprior to the conclusion of Peace, either by detention in their ports or\r\nby the provisional transfer of tonnage under the Brussels Agreement in\r\nconnection with the supply of foodstuffs.[119] Estimating the tonnage of\r\nGerman shipping to be taken over under the Treaty at 4,000,000 gross\r\ntons, and the average value per ton at $150 per ton, the total money\r\nvalue involved is $600,000,000.[120]\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Foreign Securities_.--Prior to the census of foreign securities\r\ncarried out by the German Government in September, 1916,[121] of which\r\nthe exact results have not been made public, no official return of such\r\ninvestments was ever called for in Germany, and the various unofficial\r\nestimates are confessedly based on insufficient data, such as the\r\nadmission of foreign securities to the German Stock Exchanges, the\r\nreceipts of the stamp duties, consular reports, etc. The principal\r\nGerman estimates current before the war are given in the appended\r\nfootnote.[122] This shows a general consensus of opinion among German\r\nauthorities that their net foreign investments were upwards of\r\n$6,250,000,000. I take this figure as the basis of my calculations,\r\nalthough I believe it to be an exaggeration; $5,000,000,000 would\r\nprobably be a safer figure.\r\n\r\nDeductions from this aggregate total have to be made under four heads.\r\n\r\n(i.) Investments in Allied countries and in the United States, which\r\nbetween them constitute a considerable part of the world, have been\r\nsequestrated by Public Trustees, Custodians of Enemy Property, and\r\nsimilar officials, and are not available for Reparation except in so far\r\nas they show a surplus over various private claims. Under the scheme for\r\ndealing with enemy debts outlined in Chapter IV., the first charge on\r\nthese assets is the private claims of Allied against German nationals.\r\nIt is unlikely, except in the United States, that there will be any\r\nappreciable surplus for any other purpose.\r\n\r\n(ii.) Germany's most important fields of foreign investment before the\r\nwar were not, like ours, oversea, but in Russia, Austria-Hungary,\r\nTurkey, Roumania, and Bulgaria. A great part of these has now become\r\nalmost valueless, at any rate for the time being; especially those in\r\nRussia and Austria-Hungary. If present market value is to be taken as\r\nthe test, none of these investments are now saleable above a nominal\r\nfigure. Unless the Allies are prepared to take over these securities\r\nmuch above their nominal market valuation, and hold them for future\r\nrealization, there is no substantial source of funds for immediate\r\npayment in the form of investments in these countries.\r\n\r\n(iii.) While Germany was not in a position to realize her foreign\r\ninvestments during the war to the degree that we were, she did so\r\nnevertheless in the case of certain countries and to the extent that\r\nshe was able. Before the United States came into the war, she is\r\nbelieved to have resold a large part of the pick of her investments in\r\nAmerican securities, although some current estimates of these sales (a\r\nfigure of $300,000,000 has been mentioned) are probably exaggerated. But\r\nthroughout the war and particularly in its later stages, when her\r\nexchanges were weak and her credit in the neighboring neutral countries\r\nwas becoming very low, she was disposing of such securities as Holland,\r\nSwitzerland, and Scandinavia would buy or would accept as collateral. It\r\nis reasonably certain that by June, 1919, her investments in these\r\ncountries had been reduced to a negligible figure and were far exceeded\r\nby her liabilities in them. Germany has also sold certain overseas\r\nsecurities, such as Argentine cedulas, for which a market could be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n(iv.) It is certain that since the Armistice there has been a great\r\nflight abroad of the foreign securities still remaining in private\r\nhands. This is exceedingly difficult to prevent. German foreign\r\ninvestments are as a rule in the form of bearer securities and are not\r\nregistered. They are easily smuggled abroad across Germany's extensive\r\nland frontiers, and for some months before the conclusion of peace it\r\nwas certain that their owners would not be allowed to retain them if the\r\nAllied Governments could discover any method of getting hold of them.\r\nThese factors combined to stimulate human ingenuity, and the efforts\r\nboth of the Allied and of the German Governments to interfere\r\neffectively with the outflow are believed to have been largely futile.\r\n\r\nIn face of all these considerations, it will be a miracle if much\r\nremains for Reparation. The countries of the Allies and of the United\r\nStates, the countries of Germany's own allies, and the neutral countries\r\nadjacent to Germany exhaust between them almost the whole of the\r\ncivilized world; and, as we have seen, we cannot expect much to be\r\navailable for Reparation from investments in any of these quarters.\r\nIndeed there remain no countries of importance for investments except\r\nthose of South America.\r\n\r\nTo convert the significance of these deductions into figures involves\r\nmuch guesswork. I give the reader the best personal estimate I can form\r\nafter pondering the matter in the light of the available figures and\r\nother relevant data.\r\n\r\nI put the deduction under (i.) at $1,500,000,000, of which $500,000,000\r\nmay be ultimately available after meeting private debts, etc.\r\n\r\nAs regards (ii.)--according to a census taken by the Austrian Ministry\r\nof Finance on the 31st December, 1912, the nominal value of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian securities held by Germans was $986,500,000. Germany's\r\npre-war investments in Russia outside Government securities have been\r\nestimated at $475,000,000, which is much lower than would be expected,\r\nand in 1906 Sartorius v. Waltershausen estimated her investments in\r\nRussian Government securities at $750,000,000. This gives a total of\r\n$1,225,000,000, which is to some extent borne out by the figure of\r\n$1,000,000,000 given in 1911 by Dr. Ischchanian as a deliberately modest\r\nestimate. A Roumanian estimate, published at the time of that country's\r\nentry in the war, gave the value of Germany's investments in Roumania at\r\n$20,000,000 to $22,000,000, of which $14,000,000 to $16,000,000 were in\r\nGovernment securities. An association for the defense of French\r\ninterests in Turkey, as reported in the _Temps_ (Sept. 8, 1919), has\r\nestimated the total amount of German capital invested in Turkey at about\r\n$295,000,000, of which, according to the latest Report of the Council of\r\nForeign Bondholders, $162,500,000 was held by German nationals in the\r\nTurkish External Debt. No estimates are available to me of Germany's\r\ninvestments in Bulgaria. Altogether I venture a deduction of\r\n$2,500,000,000 in respect of this group of countries as a whole.\r\n\r\nResales and the pledging as collateral of securities during the war\r\nunder (iii.) I put at $500,000,000 to $750,000,000, comprising\r\npractically all Germany's holding of Scandinavian, Dutch, and Swiss\r\nsecurities, a part of her South American securities, and a substantial\r\nproportion of her North American securities sold prior to the entry of\r\nthe United States into the war.\r\n\r\nAs to the proper deduction under (iv.) there are naturally no available\r\nfigures. For months past the European press has been full of sensational\r\nstories of the expedients adopted. But if we put the value of securities\r\nwhich have already left Germany or have been safely secreted within\r\nGermany itself beyond discovery by the most inquisitorial and powerful\r\nmethods at $500,000,000, we are not likely to overstate it.\r\n\r\nThese various items lead, therefore, in all to a deduction of a round\r\nfigure of about $5,000,000,000, and leave us with an amount of\r\n$1,250,000,000 theoretically still available.[123]\r\n\r\nTo some readers this figure may seem low, but let them remember that it\r\npurports to represent the remnant of _saleable_ securities upon which\r\nthe German Government might be able to lay hands for public purposes. In\r\nmy own opinion it is much too high, and considering the problem by a\r\ndifferent method of attack I arrive at a lower figure. For leaving out\r\nof account sequestered Allied securities and investments in Austria,\r\nRussia, etc., what blocks of securities, specified by countries and\r\nenterprises, can Germany possibly still have which could amount to as\r\nmuch as $1,250,000,000? I cannot answer the question. She has some\r\nChinese Government securities which have not been sequestered, a few\r\nJapanese perhaps, and a more substantial value of first-class South\r\nAmerican properties. But there are very few enterprises of this class\r\nstill in German hands, and even _their_ value is measured by one or two\r\ntens of millions, not by fifties or hundreds. He would be a rash man, in\r\nmy judgment, who joined a syndicate to pay $500,000,000 in cash for the\r\nunsequestered remnant of Germany's overseas investments. If the\r\nReparation Commission is to realize even this lower figure, it is\r\nprobable that they will have to nurse, for some years, the assets which\r\nthey take over, not attempting their disposal at the present time.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, a figure of from $500,000,000 to $1,250,000,000 as\r\nthe maximum contribution from Germany's foreign securities.\r\n\r\nHer immediately transferable wealth is composed, then, of--\r\n\r\n(_a_) Gold and silver--say $300,000,000.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Ships--$600,000,000.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Foreign securities--$500,000,000 to $1,250,000,000.\r\n\r\nOf the gold and silver, it is not, in fact, practicable to take any\r\nsubstantial part without consequences to the German currency system\r\ninjurious to the interests of the Allies themselves. The contribution\r\nfrom all these sources together which the Reparation Commission can hope\r\nto secure by May, 1921, may be put, therefore, at from $1,250,000,000 to\r\n$1,750,000,000 _as a maximum_.[124]\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Property in ceded Territory or surrendered under the Armistice_\r\n\r\nAs the Treaty has been drafted Germany will not receive important\r\ncredits available towards meeting reparation in respect of her property\r\nin ceded territory.\r\n\r\n_Private_ property in most of the ceded territory is utilized towards\r\ndischarging private German debts to Allied nationals, and only the\r\nsurplus, if any, is available towards Reparation. The value of such\r\nproperty in Poland and the other new States is payable direct to the\r\nowners.\r\n\r\n_Government_ property in Alsace-Lorraine, in territory ceded to Belgium,\r\nand in Germany's former colonies transferred to a Mandatory, is to be\r\nforfeited without credit given. Buildings, forests, and other State\r\nproperty which belonged to the former Kingdom of Poland are also to be\r\nsurrendered without credit. There remain, therefore, Government\r\nproperties, other than the above, surrendered to Poland, Government\r\nproperties in Schleswig surrendered to Denmark,[125] the value of the\r\nSaar coalfields, the value of certain river craft, etc., to be\r\nsurrendered under the Ports, Waterways, and Railways Chapter, and the\r\nvalue of the German submarine cables transferred under Annex VII. of the\r\nReparation Chapter.\r\n\r\nWhatever the Treaty may say, the Reparation Commission will not secure\r\nany cash payments from Poland. I believe that the Saar coalfields have\r\nbeen valued at from $75,000,000 to $100,000,000. A round figure of\r\n$150,000,000 for all the above items, excluding any surplus available in\r\nrespect of private property, is probably a liberal estimate.\r\n\r\nThen remains the value of material surrendered under the Armistice.\r\nArticle 250 provides that a credit shall be assessed by the Reparation\r\nCommission for rolling-stock surrendered under the Armistice as well as\r\nfor certain other specified items, and generally for any material so\r\nsurrendered for which the Reparation Commission think that credit should\r\nbe given, \"as having non-military value.\" The rolling-stock (150,000\r\nwagons and 5,000 locomotives) is the only very valuable item. A round\r\nfigure of $250,000,000, for all the Armistice surrenders, is probably\r\nagain a liberal estimate.\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, $400,000,000 to add in respect of this heading to\r\nour figure of $1,250,000,000 to $1,750,000,000 under the previous\r\nheading. This figure differs from the preceding in that it does not\r\nrepresent cash capable of benefiting the financial situation of the\r\nAllies, but is only a book credit between themselves or between them and\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe total of $1,650,000,000 to $2,150,000,000 now reached is not,\r\nhowever, available for Reparation. The _first_ charge upon it, under\r\nArticle 251 of the Treaty, is the cost of the Armies of Occupation both\r\nduring the Armistice and after the conclusion of Peace. The aggregate of\r\nthis figure up to May, 1921, cannot be calculated until the rate of\r\nwithdrawal is known which is to reduce the _monthly_ cost from the\r\nfigure exceeding $100,000,000, which prevailed during the first part of\r\n1919, to that of $5,000,000, which is to be the normal figure\r\neventually. I estimate, however, that this aggregate may be about\r\n$1,000,000,000. This leaves us with from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000\r\nstill in hand.\r\n\r\nOut of this, and out of exports of goods, and payments in kind under the\r\nTreaty prior to May, 1921 (for which I have not as yet made any\r\nallowance), the Allies have held out the hope that they will allow\r\nGermany to receive back such sums for the purchase of necessary food and\r\nraw materials as the former deem it essential for her to have. It is not\r\npossible at the present time to form an accurate judgment either as to\r\nthe money-value of the goods which Germany will require to purchase from\r\nabroad in order to re-establish her economic life, or as to the degree\r\nof liberality with which the Allies will exercise their discretion. If\r\nher stocks of raw materials and food were to be restored to anything\r\napproaching their normal level by May, 1921, Germany would probably\r\nrequire foreign purchasing power of from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000\r\nat least, in addition to the value of her current exports. While this is\r\nnot likely to be permitted, I venture to assert as a matter beyond\r\nreasonable dispute that the social and economic condition of Germany\r\ncannot possibly permit a surplus of exports over imports during the\r\nperiod prior to May, 1921, and that the value of any payments in kind\r\nwith which she may be able to furnish the Allies under the Treaty in the\r\nform of coal, dyes, timber, or other materials will have to be returned\r\nto her to enable her to pay for imports essential to her existence.[126]\r\n\r\nThe Reparation Commission can, therefore, expect no addition from other\r\nsources to the sum of from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 with which we\r\nhave hypothetically credited it after the realization of Germany's\r\nimmediately transferable wealth, the calculation of the credits due to\r\nGermany under the Treaty, and the discharge of the cost of the Armies of\r\nOccupation. As Belgium has secured a private agreement with France, the\r\nUnited States, and Great Britain, outside the Treaty, by which she is to\r\nreceive, towards satisfaction of her claims, the _first_ $500,000,000\r\navailable for Reparation, the upshot of the whole matter is that Belgium\r\nmay _possibly_ get her $500,000,000 by May, 1921, but none of the other\r\nAllies are likely to secure by that date any contribution worth speaking\r\nof. At any rate, it would be very imprudent for Finance Ministers to lay\r\ntheir plans on any other hypothesis.\r\n\r\n3. _Annual Payments spread over a Term of Years_\r\n\r\nIt is evident that Germany's pre-war capacity to pay an annual foreign\r\ntribute has not been unaffected by the almost total loss of her\r\ncolonies, her overseas connections, her mercantile marine, and her\r\nforeign properties, by the cession of ten per cent of her territory and\r\npopulation, of one-third of her coal and of three-quarters of her iron\r\nore, by two million casualties amongst men in the prime of life, by the\r\nstarvation of her people for four years, by the burden of a vast war\r\ndebt, by the depreciation of her currency to less than one-seventh its\r\nformer value, by the disruption of her allies and their territories, by\r\nRevolution at home and Bolshevism on her borders, and by all the\r\nunmeasured ruin in strength and hope of four years of all-swallowing war\r\nand final defeat.\r\n\r\nAll this, one would have supposed, is evident. Yet most estimates of a\r\ngreat indemnity from Germany depend on the assumption that she is in a\r\nposition to conduct in the future a vastly greater trade than ever she\r\nhas had in the past.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of arriving at a figure it is of no great consequence\r\nwhether payment takes the form of cash (or rather of foreign exchange)\r\nor is partly effected in kind (coal, dyes, timber, etc.), as\r\ncontemplated by the Treaty. In any event, it is only by the export of\r\nspecific commodities that Germany can pay, and the method of turning the\r\nvalue of these exports to account for Reparation purposes is,\r\ncomparatively, a matter of detail.\r\n\r\nWe shall lose ourselves in mere hypothesis unless we return in some\r\ndegree to first principles, and, whenever we can, to such statistics as\r\nthere are. It is certain that an annual payment can only be made by\r\nGermany over a series of years by diminishing her imports and increasing\r\nher exports, thus enlarging the balance in her favor which is available\r\nfor effecting payments abroad. Germany can pay in the long-run in goods,\r\nand in goods only, whether these goods are furnished direct to the\r\nAllies, or whether they are sold to neutrals and the neutral credits so\r\narising are then made over to the Allies. The most solid basis for\r\nestimating the extent to which this process can be carried is to be\r\nfound, therefore, in an analysis of her trade returns before the war.\r\nOnly on the basis of such an analysis, supplemented by some general data\r\nas to the aggregate wealth-producing capacity of the country, can a\r\nrational guess be made as to the maximum degree to which the exports of\r\nGermany could be brought to exceed her imports.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1913 Germany's imports amounted to $2,690,000,000, and her\r\nexports to $2,525,000,000, exclusive of transit trade and bullion. That\r\nis to say, imports exceeded exports by about $165,000,000. On the\r\naverage of the five years ending 1913, however, her imports exceeded her\r\nexports by a substantially larger amount, namely, $370,000,000. It\r\nfollows, therefore, that more than the whole of Germany's pre-war\r\nbalance for new foreign investment was derived from the interest on her\r\nexisting foreign securities, and from the profits of her shipping,\r\nforeign banking, etc. As her foreign properties and her mercantile\r\nmarine are now to be taken from her, and as her foreign banking and\r\nother miscellaneous sources of revenue from abroad have been largely\r\ndestroyed, it appears that, on the pre-war basis of exports and imports,\r\nGermany, so far from having a surplus wherewith to make a foreign\r\npayment, would be not nearly self-supporting. Her first task, therefore,\r\nmust be to effect a readjustment of consumption and production to cover\r\nthis deficit. Any further economy she can effect in the use of imported\r\ncommodities, and any further stimulation of exports will then be\r\navailable for Reparation.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds of Germany's import and export trade is enumerated under\r\nseparate headings in the following tables.

It will be observed that all these goods are of a kind in\r\nwhich before the war competition between Germany and the United Kingdom\r\nwas very severe. If, therefore, the volume of such exports to overseas\r\nor European destinations is very largely increased the effect upon\r\nBritish export trade must be correspondingly serious. As regards two of\r\nthe categories, namely, cotton and woolen goods, the increase of an\r\nexport trade is dependent upon an increase of the import of the raw\r\nmaterial, since Germany produces no cotton and practically no wool.\r\nThese trades are therefore incapable of expansion unless Germany is\r\ngiven facilities for securing these raw materials (which can only be at\r\nthe expense of the Allies) in excess of the pre-war standard of\r\nconsumption, and even then the effective increase is not the gross value\r\nof the exports, but only the difference between the value of the\r\nmanufactured exports and of the imported raw material. As regards the\r\nother three categories, namely, machinery, iron goods, and coal,\r\nGermany's capacity to increase her exports will have been taken from her\r\nby the cessions of territory in Poland, Upper Silesia, and\r\nAlsace-Lorraine. As has been pointed out already, these districts\r\naccounted for nearly one-third of Germany's production of coal. But they\r\nalso supplied no less than three-quarters of her iron-ore production, 38\r\nper cent of her blast furnaces, and 9.5 per cent of her iron and steel\r\nfoundries. Unless, therefore, Alsace-Lorraine and Upper Silesia send\r\ntheir iron ore to Germany proper, to be worked up, which will involve an\r\nincrease in the imports for which she will have to find payment, so far\r\nfrom any increase in export trade being possible, a decrease is\r\ninevitable.[127]\r\n\r\nNext on the list come cereals, leather goods, sugar, paper, furs,\r\nelectrical goods, silk goods, and dyes. Cereals are not a net export and\r\nare far more than balanced by imports of the same commodities. As\r\nregards sugar, nearly 90 per cent of Germany's pre-war exports came to\r\nthe United Kingdom.[128] An increase in this trade might be stimulated\r\nby a grant of a preference in this country to German sugar or by an\r\narrangement by which sugar was taken in part payment for the indemnity\r\non the same lines as has been proposed for coal, dyes, etc. Paper\r\nexports also might be capable of some increase. Leather goods, furs, and\r\nsilks depend upon corresponding imports on the other side of the\r\naccount. Silk goods are largely in competition with the trade of France\r\nand Italy. The remaining items are individually very small. I have heard\r\nit suggested that the indemnity might be paid to a great extent in\r\npotash and the like. But potash before the war represented 0.6 per cent\r\nof Germany's export trade, and about $15,000,000 in aggregate value.\r\nBesides, France, having secured a potash field in the territory which\r\nhas been restored to her, will not welcome a great stimulation of the\r\nGerman exports of this material.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the import list shows that 63.6 per cent are raw\r\nmaterials and food. The chief items of the former class, namely, cotton,\r\nwool, copper, hides, iron-ore, furs, silk, rubber, and tin, could not be\r\nmuch reduced without reacting on the export trade, and might have to be\r\nincreased if the export trade was to be increased. Imports of food,\r\nnamely, wheat, barley, coffee, eggs, rice, maize, and the like, present\r\na different problem. It is unlikely that, apart from certain comforts,\r\nthe consumption of food by the German laboring classes before the war\r\nwas in excess of what was required for maximum efficiency; indeed, it\r\nprobably fell short of that amount. Any substantial decrease in the\r\nimports of food would therefore react on the efficiency of the\r\nindustrial population, and consequently on the volume of surplus exports\r\nwhich they could be forced to produce. It is hardly possible to insist\r\non a greatly increased productivity of German industry if the workmen\r\nare to be underfed. But this may not be equally true of barley, coffee,\r\neggs, and tobacco. If it were possible to enforce a rÈgime in which for\r\nthe future no German drank beer or coffee, or smoked any tobacco, a\r\nsubstantial saving could be effected. Otherwise there seems little room\r\nfor any significant reduction.\r\n\r\nThe following analysis of German exports and imports, according to\r\ndestination and origin, is also relevant. From this it appears that of\r\nGermany's exports in 1913, 18 per cent went to the British Empire, 17\r\nper cent to France, Italy, and Belgium, 10 per cent to Russia and\r\nRoumania, and 7 per cent to the United States; that is to say, more than\r\nhalf of the exports found their market in the countries of the Entente\r\nnations. Of the balance, 12 per cent went to Austria-Hungary, Turkey,\r\nand Bulgaria, and 35 per cent elsewhere. Unless, therefore, the present\r\nAllies are prepared to encourage the importation of German products, a\r\nsubstantial increase in total volume can only be effected by the\r\nwholesale swamping of neutral markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n    GERMAN TRADE (1913) ACCORDING TO DESTINATION AND ORIGIN.\r\n\r\n    ----------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n                          |   Destination of   |     Origin of\r\n                          |  Germany's Exports |  Germany's Imports\r\n    ----------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n                          |  Million  Per cent |  Million  Per cent\r\n                          |  Dollars           |  Dollars\r\n    Great Britain         |   359.55    14.2   |   219.00     8.1\r\n    India                 |    37.65     1.5   |   135.20     5.0\r\n    Egypt                 |    10.85     0.4   |    29.60     1.1\r\n    Canada                |    15.10     0.6   |    16.00     0.6\r\n    Australia             |    22.10     0.9   |    74.00     2.8\r\n    South Africa          |    11.70     0.5   |    17.40     0.6\r\n                          |   ------    ----   |   ------    ----\r\n    Total: British Empire |   456.95    18.1   |   491.20    18.2\r\n                          |                    |\r\n    France                |   197.45     7.8   |   146.05     5.4\r\n    Belgium               |   137.75     5.5   |    86.15     3.2\r\n    Italy                 |    98.35     3.9   |    79.40     3.0\r\n    U.S.A.                |   178.30     7.1   |   427.80    15.9\r\n    Russia                |   220.00     8.7   |   356.15    13.2\r\n    Roumania              |    35.00     1.4   |    19.95     0.7\r\n    Austria-Hungary       |   276.20    10.9   |   206.80     7.7\r\n    Turkey                |    24.60     1.0   |    18.40     0.7\r\n    Bulgaria              |     7.55     0.3   |     2.00     ...\r\n    Other countries       |   890.20    35.3   |   858.70    32.0\r\n                          |   ------    ----   |   ------    ----\r\n                          | 2,522.35   100.0   | 2,692.60   100.0\r\n    ----------------------+--------------------+--------------------\r\n\r\nThe above analysis affords some indication of the possible magnitude of\r\nthe maximum modification of Germany's export balance under the\r\nconditions which will prevail after the Peace. On the assumptions (1)\r\nthat we do not specially favor Germany over ourselves in supplies of\r\nsuch raw materials as cotton and wool (the world's supply of which is\r\nlimited), (2) that France, having secured the iron-ore deposits, makes a\r\nserious attempt to secure the blast-furnaces and the steel trade also,\r\n(3) that Germany is not encouraged and assisted to undercut the iron and\r\nother trades of the Allies in overseas market, and (4) that a\r\nsubstantial preference is not given to German goods in the British\r\nEmpire, it is evident by examination of the specific items that not much\r\nis practicable.\r\n\r\nLet us run over the chief items again: (1) Iron goods. In view of\r\nGermany's loss of resources, an increased net export seems impossible\r\nand a large decrease probable. (2) Machinery. Some increase is possible.\r\n(3) Coal and coke. The value of Germany's net export before the war was\r\n$110,000,000; the Allies have agreed that for the time being 20,000,000\r\ntons is the maximum possible export with a problematic (and in fact)\r\nimpossible increase to 40,000,000 tons at some future time; even on the\r\nbasis of 20,000,000 tons we have virtually no increase of value,\r\nmeasured in pre-war prices;[129] whilst, if this amount is exacted,\r\nthere must be a decrease of far greater value in the export of\r\nmanufactured articles requiring coal for their production. (4) Woolen\r\ngoods. An increase is impossible without the raw wool, and, having\r\nregard to the other claims on supplies of raw wool, a decrease is\r\nlikely. (5) Cotton goods. The same considerations apply as to wool. (6)\r\nCereals. There never was and never can be a net export. (7) Leather\r\ngoods. The same considerations apply as to wool.\r\n\r\nWe have now covered nearly half of Germany's pre-war exports, and there\r\nis no other commodity which formerly represented as much as 3 per cent\r\nof her exports. In what commodity is she to pay? Dyes?--their total\r\nvalue in 1913 was $50,000,000. Toys? Potash?--1913 exports were worth\r\n$15,000,000. And even if the commodities could be specified, in what\r\nmarkets are they to be sold?--remembering that we have in mind goods to\r\nthe value not of tens of millions annually, but of hundreds of millions.\r\n\r\nOn the side of imports, rather more is possible. By lowering the\r\nstandard of life, an appreciable reduction of expenditure on imported\r\ncommodities may be possible. But, as we have already seen, many large\r\nitems are incapable of reduction without reacting on the volume of\r\nexports.\r\n\r\nLet us put our guess as high as we can without being foolish, and\r\nsuppose that after a time Germany will be able, in spite of the\r\nreduction of her resources, her facilities, her markets, and her\r\nproductive power, to increase her exports and diminish her imports so as\r\nto improve her trade balance altogether by $500,000,000 annually,\r\nmeasured in pre-war prices. This adjustment is first required to\r\nliquidate the adverse trade balance, which in the five years before the\r\nwar averaged $370,000,000; but we will assume that after allowing for\r\nthis, she is left with a favorable trade balance of $250,000,000 a year.\r\nDoubling this to allow for the rise in pre-war prices, we have a figure\r\nof $500,000,000. Having regard to the political, social, and human\r\nfactors, as well as to the purely economic, I doubt if Germany could be\r\nmade to pay this sum annually over a period of 30 years; but it would\r\nnot be foolish to assert or to hope that she could.\r\n\r\nSuch a figure, allowing 5 per cent for interest, and 1 per cent for\r\nrepayment of capital, represents a capital sum having a present value of\r\nabout $8,500,000,000.[130]\r\n\r\nI reach, therefore, the final conclusion that, including all methods of\r\npayment--immediately transferable wealth, ceded property, and an annual\r\ntribute--$10,000,000,000 is a safe maximum figure of Germany's capacity\r\nto pay. In all the actual circumstances, I do not believe that she can\r\npay as much. Let those who consider this a very low figure, bear in mind\r\nthe following remarkable comparison. The wealth of France in 1871 was\r\nestimated at a little less than half that of Germany in 1913. Apart from\r\nchanges in the value of money, an indemnity from Germany of\r\n$2,500,000,000 would, therefore, be about comparable to the sum paid by\r\nFrance in 1871; and as the real burden of an indemnity increases more\r\nthan in proportion to its amount, the payment of $10,000,000,000 by\r\nGermany would have far severer consequences than the $1,000,000,000 paid\r\nby France in 1871.\r\n\r\nThere is only one head under which I see a possibility of adding to the\r\nfigure reached on the line of argument adopted above; that is, if German\r\nlabor is actually transported to the devastated areas and there engaged\r\nin the work of reconstruction. I have heard that a limited scheme of\r\nthis kind is actually in view. The additional contribution thus\r\nobtainable depends on the number of laborers which the German Government\r\ncould contrive to maintain in this way and also on the number which,\r\nover a period of years, the Belgian and French inhabitants would\r\ntolerate in their midst. In any case, it would seem very difficult to\r\nemploy on the actual work of reconstruction, even over a number of\r\nyears, imported labor having a net present value exceeding (say)\r\n$1,250,000,000; and even this would not prove in practice a net addition\r\nto the annual contributions obtainable in other ways.\r\n\r\nA capacity of $40,000,000,000 or even of $25,000,000,000 is, therefore,\r\nnot within the limits of reasonable possibility. It is for those who\r\nbelieve that Germany can make an annual payment amounting to hundreds of\r\nmillions sterling to say _in what specific commodities_ they intend this\r\npayment to be made and _in what markets_ the goods are to be sold. Until\r\nthey proceed to some degree of detail, and are able to produce some\r\ntangible argument in favor of their conclusions, they do not deserve to\r\nbe believed.[131]\r\n\r\nI make three provisos only, none of which affect the force of my\r\nargument for immediate practical purposes.\r\n\r\n_First_: if the Allies were to \"nurse\" the trade and industry of Germany\r\nfor a period of five or ten years, supplying her with large loans, and\r\nwith ample shipping, food, and raw materials during that period,\r\nbuilding up markets for her, and deliberately applying all their\r\nresources and goodwill to making her the greatest industrial nation in\r\nEurope, if not in the world, a substantially larger sum could probably\r\nbe extracted thereafter; for Germany is capable of very great\r\nproductivity.\r\n\r\n_Second_: whilst I estimate in terms of money, I assume that there is no\r\nrevolutionary change in the purchasing power of our unit of value. If\r\nthe value of gold were to sink to a half or a tenth of its present\r\nvalue, the real burden of a payment fixed in terms of gold would be\r\nreduced proportionately. If a sovereign comes to be worth what a\r\nshilling is worth now, then, of course, Germany can pay a larger sum\r\nthan I have named, measured in gold sovereigns.\r\n\r\n_Third_: I assume that there is no revolutionary change in the yield of\r\nNature and material to man's labor. It is not _impossible_ that the\r\nprogress of science should bring within our reach methods and devices by\r\nwhich the whole standard of life would be raised immeasurably, and a\r\ngiven volume of products would represent but a portion of the human\r\neffort which it represents now. In this case all standards of \"capacity\"\r\nwould be changed everywhere. But the fact that all things are _possible_\r\nis no excuse for talking foolishly.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in 1870 no man could have predicted Germany's capacity\r\nin 1910. We cannot expect to legislate for a generation or more. The\r\nsecular changes in man's economic condition and the liability of human\r\nforecast to error are as likely to lead to mistake in one direction as\r\nin another. We cannot as reasonable men do better than base our policy\r\non the evidence we have and adapt it to the five or ten years over which\r\nwe may suppose ourselves to have some measure of prevision; and we are\r\nnot at fault if we leave on one side the extreme chances of human\r\nexistence and of revolutionary changes in the order of Nature or of\r\nman's relations to her. The fact that we have no adequate knowledge of\r\nGermany's capacity to pay over a long period of years is no\r\njustification (as I have heard some people claim that, it is) for the\r\nstatement that she can pay $50,000,000,000.\r\n\r\nWhy has the world been so credulous of the unveracities of politicians?\r\nIf an explanation is needed, I attribute this particular credulity to\r\nthe following influences in part.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the vast expenditures of the war, the inflation of\r\nprices, and the depreciation of currency, leading up to a complete\r\ninstability of the unit of value, have made us lose all sense of number\r\nand magnitude in matters of finance. What we believed to be the limits\r\nof possibility have been so enormously exceeded, and those who founded\r\ntheir expectations on the past have been so often wrong, that the man in\r\nthe street is now prepared to believe anything which is told him with\r\nsome show of authority, and the larger the figure the more readily he\r\nswallows it.\r\n\r\nBut those who look into the matter more deeply are sometimes misled by a\r\nfallacy, much more plausible to reasonableness. Such a one might base\r\nhis conclusions on Germany's total surplus of annual productivity as\r\ndistinct from her export surplus. Helfferich's estimate of Germany's\r\nannual increment of wealth in 1913 was $2,000,000,000 to $2,125,000,000\r\n(exclusive of increased money value of existing land and property).\r\nBefore the war, Germany spent between $250,000,000 and $500,000,000 on\r\narmaments, with which she can now dispense. Why, therefore, should she\r\nnot pay over to the Allies an annual sum of $2,500,000,000? This puts\r\nthe crude argument in its strongest and most plausible form.\r\n\r\nBut there are two errors in it. First of all, Germany's annual savings,\r\nafter what she has suffered in the war and by the Peace, will fall far\r\nshort of what they were before, and, if they are taken from her year by\r\nyear in future, they cannot again reach their previous level. The loss\r\nof Alsace-Lorraine, Poland, and Upper Silesia could not be assessed in\r\nterms of surplus productivity at less than $250,000,000 annually.\r\nGermany is supposed to have profited about $500,000,000 per annum from\r\nher ships, her foreign investments, and her foreign banking and\r\nconnections, all of which have now been taken from her. Her saving on\r\narmaments is far more than balanced by her annual charge for pensions\r\nnow estimated at $1,250,000,000,[132] which represents a real loss of\r\nproductive capacity. And even if we put on one side the burden of the\r\ninternal debt, which amounts to 24 milliards of marks, as being a\r\nquestion of internal distribution rather than of productivity, we must\r\nstill allow for the foreign debt incurred by Germany during the war, the\r\nexhaustion of her stock of raw materials, the depletion of her\r\nlive-stock, the impaired productivity of her soil from lack of manures\r\nand of labor, and the diminution in her wealth from the failure to keep\r\nup many repairs and renewals over a period of nearly five years. Germany\r\nis not as rich as she was before the war, and the diminution in her\r\nfuture savings for these reasons, quite apart from the factors\r\npreviously allowed for, could hardly be put at less than ten per cent,\r\nthat is $200,000,000 annually.\r\n\r\nThese factors have already reduced Germany's annual surplus to less than\r\nthe $500,000,000 at which we arrived on other grounds as the maximum of\r\nher annual payments. But even if the rejoinder be made, that we have not\r\nyet allowed for the lowering of the standard of life and comfort in\r\nGermany which may reasonably be imposed on a defeated enemy,[133] there\r\nis still a fundamental fallacy in the method of calculation. An annual\r\nsurplus available for home investment can only be converted into a\r\nsurplus available for export abroad by a radical change in the kind of\r\nwork performed. Labor, while it may be available and efficient for\r\ndomestic services in Germany, may yet be able to find no outlet in\r\nforeign trade. We are back on the same question which faced us in our\r\nexamination of the export trade--in _what_ export trade is German labor\r\ngoing to find a greatly increased outlet? Labor can only he diverted\r\ninto new channels with loss of efficiency, and a large expenditure of\r\ncapital. The annual surplus which German labor can produce for capital\r\nimprovements at home is no measure, either theoretically or practically,\r\nof the annual tribute which she can pay abroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. _The Reparation Commission_.\r\n\r\nThis body is so remarkable a construction and may, if it functions at\r\nall, exert so wide an influence on the life of Europe, that its\r\nattributes deserve a separate examination.\r\n\r\nThere are no precedents for the indemnity imposed on Germany under the\r\npresent Treaty; for the money exactions which formed part of the\r\nsettlement after previous wars have differed in two fundamental respects\r\nfrom this one. The sum demanded has been determinate and has been\r\nmeasured in a lump sum of money; and so long as the defeated party was\r\nmeeting the annual instalments of cash no consequential interference was\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut for reasons already elucidated, the exactions in this case are not\r\nyet determinate, and the sum when fixed will prove in excess of what can\r\nbe paid in cash and in excess also of what can be paid at all. It was\r\nnecessary, therefore, to set up a body to establish the bill of claim,\r\nto fix the mode of payment, and to approve necessary abatements and\r\ndelays. It was only possible to place this body in a position to exact\r\nthe utmost year by year by giving it wide powers over the internal\r\neconomic life of the enemy countries, who are to be treated henceforward\r\nas bankrupt estates to be administered by and for the benefit of the\r\ncreditors. In fact, however, its powers and functions have been enlarged\r\neven beyond what was required for this purpose, and the Reparation\r\nCommission has been established as the final arbiter on numerous\r\neconomic and financial issues which it was convenient to leave unsettled\r\nin the Treaty itself.[134]\r\n\r\nThe powers and constitution of the Reparation Commission are mainly laid\r\ndown in Articles 233-241 and Annex II. of the Reparation Chapter of the\r\nTreaty with Germany. But the same Commission is to exercise authority\r\nover Austria and Bulgaria, and possibly over Hungary and Turkey, when\r\nPeace is made with these countries. There are, therefore, analogous\r\narticles _mutatis mudandis_ in the Austrian Treaty[135] and in the\r\nBulgarian Treaty.[136]\r\n\r\nThe principal Allies are each represented by one chief delegate.\r\nThe delegates of the United States, Great Britain, France, and\r\nItaly take part in all proceedings; the delegate of Belgium in all\r\nproceedings except those attended by the delegates of Japan or the\r\nSerb-Croat-Slovene State; the delegate of Japan in all proceedings\r\naffecting maritime or specifically Japanese questions; and the\r\ndelegate of the Serb-Croat-Slovene State when questions relating to\r\nAustria, Hungary, or Bulgaria are under consideration. Other allies\r\nare to be represented by delegates, without the power to vote,\r\nwhenever their respective claims and interests are under examination.\r\n\r\nIn general the Commission decides by a majority vote, except in certain\r\nspecific cases where unanimity is required, of which the most important\r\nare the cancellation of German indebtedness, long postponement of the\r\ninstalments, and the sale of German bonds of indebtedness. The\r\nCommission is endowed with full executive authority to carry out its\r\ndecisions. It may set up an executive staff and delegate authority to\r\nits officers. The Commission and its staff are to enjoy diplomatic\r\nprivileges, and its salaries are to be paid by Germany, who will,\r\nhowever, have no voice in fixing them, If the Commission is to discharge\r\nadequately its numerous functions, it will be necessary for it to\r\nestablish a vast polyglot bureaucratic organization, with a staff of\r\nhundreds. To this organization, the headquarters of which will be in\r\nParis, the economic destiny of Central Europe is to be entrusted.\r\n\r\nIts main functions are as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The Commission will determine the precise figure of the claim against\r\nthe enemy Powers by an examination in detail of the claims of each of\r\nthe Allies under Annex I. of the Reparation Chapter. This task must be\r\ncompleted by May, 1921. It shall give to the German Government and to\r\nGermany's allies \"a just opportunity to be heard, but not to take any\r\npart whatever in the decisions of the Commission.\" That is to say, the\r\nCommission will act as a party and a judge at the same time.\r\n\r\n2. Having determined the claim, it will draw up a schedule of payments\r\nproviding for the discharge of the whole sum with interest within thirty\r\nyears. From time to time it shall, with a view to modifying the schedule\r\nwithin the limits of possibility, \"consider the resources and capacity\r\nof Germany ... giving her representatives a just opportunity to be heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"In periodically estimating Germany's capacity to pay, the Commission\r\nshall examine the German system of taxation, first, to the end that the\r\nsums for reparation which Germany is required to pay shall become a\r\ncharge upon all her revenues prior to that for the service or discharge\r\nof any domestic loan, and secondly, so as to satisfy itself that, in\r\ngeneral, the German scheme of taxation is fully as heavy proportionately\r\nas that of any of the Powers represented on the Commission.\"\r\n\r\n3. Up to May, 1921, the Commission has power, with a view to securing\r\nthe payment of $5,000,000,000, to demand the surrender of any piece of\r\nGerman property whatever, wherever situated: that is to say, \"Germany\r\nshall pay in such installments and in such manner, whether in gold,\r\ncommodities, ships, securities, or otherwise, as the Reparation\r\nCommission may fix.\"\r\n\r\n4. The Commission will decide which of the rights and interests of\r\nGerman nationals in public utility undertakings operating in Russia,\r\nChina, Turkey, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, or in any territory\r\nformerly belonging to Germany or her allies, are to be expropriated and\r\ntransferred to the Commission itself; it will assess the value of the\r\ninterests so transferred; and it will divide the spoils.\r\n\r\n5 The Commission will determine how much of the resources thus stripped\r\nfrom Germany must be returned to her to keep enough life in her economic\r\norganization to enable her to continue to make Reparation payments in\r\nfuture.[137]\r\n\r\n6. The Commission will assess the value, without appeal or arbitration,\r\nof the property and rights ceded under the Armistice, and under the\r\nTreaty,--roiling-stock, the mercantile marine, river craft, cattle, the\r\nSaar mines, the property in ceded territory for which credit is to be\r\ngiven, and so forth.\r\n\r\n7. The Commission will determine the amounts and values (within certain\r\ndefined limits) of the contributions which Germany is to make in kind\r\nyear by year under the various Annexes to the Reparation Chapter.\r\n\r\n8. The Commission will provide for the restitution by Germany of\r\nproperty which can be identified.\r\n\r\n9. The Commission will receive, administer, and distribute all receipts\r\nfrom Germany in cash or in kind. It will also issue and market German\r\nbonds of indebtedness.\r\n\r\n10. The Commission will assign the share of the pre-war public debt to\r\nbe taken over by the ceded areas of Schleswig, Poland, Danzig, and Upper\r\nSilesia. The Commission will also distribute the public debt of the late\r\nAustro-Hungarian Empire between its constituent parts.\r\n\r\n11. The Commission will liquidate the Austro-Hungarian Bank, and will\r\nsupervise the withdrawal and replacement of the currency system of the\r\nlate Austro-Hungarian Empire.\r\n\r\n12. It is for the Commission to report if, in their judgment, Germany is\r\nfalling short in fulfillment of her obligations, and to advise methods\r\nof coercion.\r\n\r\n13. In general, the Commission, acting through a subordinate body, will\r\nperform the same functions for Austria and Bulgaria as for Germany, and\r\nalso, presumably, for Hungary and Turkey.[138]\r\n\r\nThere are also many other relatively minor duties assigned to the\r\nCommission. The above summary, however, shows sufficiently the scope and\r\nsignificance of its authority. This authority is rendered of far greater\r\nsignificance by the fact that the demands of the Treaty generally exceed\r\nGermany's capacity. Consequently the clauses which allow the Commission\r\nto make abatements, if in their judgment the economic conditions of\r\nGermany require it, will render it in many different particulars the\r\narbiter of Germany's economic life. The Commission is not only to\r\ninquire into Germany's general capacity to pay, and to decide (in the\r\nearly years) what import of foodstuffs and raw materials is necessary;\r\nit is authorized to exert pressure on the German system of taxation\r\n(Annex II. para. 12(_b_))[139] and on German internal expenditure, with\r\na view to insuring that Reparation payments are a first charge on the\r\ncountry's entire resources; and it is to decide on the effect on German\r\neconomic life of demands for machinery, cattle, etc., and of the\r\nscheduled deliveries of coal.\r\n\r\nBy Article 240 of the Treaty Germany expressly recognizes the Commission\r\nand its powers \"as the same may be constituted by the Allied and\r\nAssociated Governments,\" and \"agrees irrevocably to the possession and\r\nexercise by such Commission of the power and authority given to it under\r\nthe present Treaty.\" She undertakes to furnish the Commission with all\r\nrelevant information. And finally in Article 241, \"Germany undertakes to\r\npass, issue, and maintain in force any legislation, orders, and decrees\r\nthat may be necessary to give complete effect to these provisions.\"\r\n\r\nThe comments on this of the German Financial Commission at Versailles\r\nwere hardly an exaggeration:--\"German democracy is thus annihilated at\r\nthe very moment when the German people was about to build it up after a\r\nsevere struggle--annihilated by the very persons who throughout the war\r\nnever tired of maintaining that they sought to bring democracy to us....\r\nGermany is no longer a people and a State, but becomes a mere trade\r\nconcern placed by its creditors in the hands of a receiver, without its\r\nbeing granted so much as the opportunity to prove its willingness to\r\nmeet its obligations of its own accord. The Commission, which is to have\r\nits permanent headquarters outside Germany, will possess in Germany\r\nincomparably greater rights than the German Emperor ever possessed, the\r\nGerman people under its rÈgime would remain for decades to come shorn\r\nof all rights, and deprived, to a far greater extent than any people in\r\nthe days of absolutism, of any independence of action, of any individual\r\naspiration in its economic or even in its ethical progress.\"\r\n\r\nIn their reply to these observations the Allies refused to admit that\r\nthere was any substance, ground, or force in them. \"The observations of\r\nthe German Delegation,\" they pronounced, \"present a view of this\r\nCommission so distorted and so inexact that it is difficult to believe\r\nthat the clauses of the Treaty have been calmly or carefully examined.\r\nIt is not an engine of oppression or a device for interfering with\r\nGerman sovereignty. It has no forces at its command; it has no executive\r\npowers within the territory of Germany; it cannot, as is suggested,\r\ndirect or control the educational or other systems of the country. Its\r\nbusiness is to ask what is to be paid; to satisfy itself that Germany\r\ncan pay; and to report to the Powers, whose delegation it is, in case\r\nGermany makes default. If Germany raises the money required in her own\r\nway, the Commission cannot order that it shall be raised in some other\r\nway; if Germany offers payment in kind, the Commission may accept such\r\npayment, but, except as specified in the Treaty itself, the Commission\r\ncannot require such a payment.\"\r\n\r\nThis is not a candid statement of the scope and authority of the\r\nReparation Commission, as will be seen by a comparison of its terms with\r\nthe summary given above or with the Treaty itself. Is not, for example,\r\nthe statement that the Commission \"has no forces at its command\" a\r\nlittle difficult to justify in view of Article 430 of the Treaty, which\r\nruns:--\"In case, either during the occupation or after the expiration of\r\nthe fifteen years referred to above, the Reparation Commission finds\r\nthat Germany refuses to observe the whole or part of her obligations\r\nunder the present Treaty with regard to Reparation, the whole or part of\r\nthe areas specified in Article 429 will be reoccupied immediately by the\r\nAllied and Associated Powers\"? The decision, as to whether Germany has\r\nkept her engagements and whether it is possible for her to keep them, is\r\nleft, it should be observed, not to the League of Nations, but to the\r\nReparation Commission itself; and an adverse ruling on the part of the\r\nCommission is to be followed \"immediately\" by the use of armed force.\r\nMoreover, the depreciation of the powers of the Commission attempted in\r\nthe Allied reply largely proceeds from the assumption that it is quite\r\nopen to Germany to \"raise the money required in her own way,\" in which\r\ncase it is true that many of the powers of the Reparation Commission\r\nwould not come into practical effect; whereas in truth one of the main\r\nreasons for setting up the Commission at all is the expectation that\r\nGermany will not be able to carry the burden nominally laid upon her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is reported that the people of Vienna, hearing that a section of the\r\nReparation Commission is about to visit them, have decided\r\ncharacteristically to pin their hopes on it. A financial body can\r\nobviously take nothing from them, for they have nothing; therefore this\r\nbody must be for the purpose of assisting and relieving them. Thus do\r\nthe Viennese argue, still light-headed in adversity. But perhaps they\r\nare right. The Reparation Commission will come into very close contact\r\nwith the problems of Europe; and it will bear a responsibility\r\nproportionate to its powers. It may thus come to fulfil a very different\r\nrÙle from that which some of its authors intended for it. Transferred to\r\nthe League of Nations, an appanage of justice and no longer of interest,\r\nwho knows that by a change of heart and object the Reparation Commission\r\nmay not yet be transformed from an instrument of oppression and rapine\r\ninto an economic council of Europe, whose object is the restoration of\r\nlife and of happiness, even in the enemy countries?\r\n\r\n_V_. _The German Counter-Proposals_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German counter-proposals were somewhat obscure, and also rather\r\ndisingenuous. It will be remembered that those clauses of the Reparation\r\nChapter which dealt with the issue of bonds by Germany produced on the\r\npublic mind the impression that the Indemnity had been fixed at\r\n$25,000,000,000, or at any rate at this figure as a minimum. The German\r\nDelegation set out, therefore, to construct their reply on the basis of\r\nthis figure, assuming apparently that public opinion in Allied countries\r\nwould not be satisfied with less than the appearance of $25,000,000,000;\r\nand, as they were not really prepared to offer so large a figure, they\r\nexercised their ingenuity to produce a formula which might be\r\nrepresented to Allied opinion as yielding this amount, whilst really\r\nrepresenting a much more modest sum. The formula produced was\r\ntransparent to any one who read it carefully and knew the facts, and it\r\ncould hardly have been expected by its authors to deceive the Allied\r\nnegotiators. The German tactic assumed, therefore, that the latter were\r\nsecretly as anxious as the Germans themselves to arrive at a settlement\r\nwhich bore some relation to the facts, and that they would therefore be\r\nwilling, in view of the entanglements which they had got themselves into\r\nwith their own publics, to practise a little collusion in drafting the\r\nTreaty,--a supposition which in slightly different circumstances might\r\nhave had a good deal of foundation. As matters actually were, this\r\nsubtlety did not benefit them, and they would have done much better with\r\na straightforward and candid estimate of what they believed to be the\r\namount of their liabilities on the one hand, and their capacity to pay\r\non the other.\r\n\r\nThe German offer of an alleged sum of $25,000,000,000 amounted to the\r\nfollowing. In the first place it was conditional on concessions in the\r\nTreaty insuring that \"Germany shall retain the territorial integrity\r\ncorresponding to the Armistice Convention,[140] that she shall keep her\r\ncolonial possessions and merchant ships, including those of large\r\ntonnage, that in her own country and in the world at large she shall\r\nenjoy the same freedom of action as all other peoples, that all war\r\nlegislation shall be at once annulled, and that all interferences during\r\nthe war with her economic rights and with German private property, etc.,\r\nshall be treated in accordance with the principle of reciprocity\";--that\r\nis to say, the offer is conditional on the greater part of the rest of\r\nthe Treaty being abandoned. In the second place, the claims are not to\r\nexceed a maximum of $25,000,000,000, of which $5,000,000,000 is to be\r\ndischarged by May 1, 1926; and no part of this sum is to carry interest\r\npending the payment of it.[141] In the third place, there are to be\r\nallowed as credit against it (amongst other things): (_a_) the value of\r\nall deliveries under the Armistice, including military material (_e.g._\r\nGermany's navy); (_b_) the value of all railways and State property in\r\nceded territory; (_c_) the _pro rata_ share of all ceded territory in\r\nthe German public debt (including the war debt) and in the Reparation\r\npayments which this territory would have had to bear if it had remained\r\npart of Germany; and (_d_) the value of the cession of Germany's claims\r\nfor sums lent by her to her allies in the war.[142]\r\n\r\nThe credits to be deducted under (_a_), (_b_), (_c_), and (_d_) might be\r\nin excess of those allowed in the actual Treaty, according to a rough\r\nestimate, by a sum of as much as $10,000,000,000, although the sum to be\r\nallowed under (_d_) can hardly be calculated.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we are to estimate the real value of the German offer of\r\n$25,000,000,000 on the basis laid down by the Treaty, we must first of\r\nall deduct $10,000,000,000 claimed for offsets which the Treaty does not\r\nallow, and then halve the remainder in order to obtain the present value\r\nof a deferred payment on which interest is not chargeable. This reduces\r\nthe offer to $7,500,000,000, as compared with the $40,000,000,000 which,\r\naccording to my rough estimate, the Treaty demands of her.\r\n\r\nThis in itself was a very substantial offer--indeed it evoked widespread\r\ncriticism in Germany--though, in view of the fact that it was\r\nconditional on the abandonment of the greater part of the rest of the\r\nTreaty, it could hardly be regarded as a serious one.[143] But the\r\nGerman Delegation would have done better if they had stated in less\r\nequivocal language how far they felt able to go.\r\n\r\nIn the final reply of the Allies to this counter-proposal there is one\r\nimportant provision, which I have not attended to hitherto, but which\r\ncan be conveniently dealt with in this place. Broadly speaking, no\r\nconcessions were entertained on the Reparation Chapter as it was\r\noriginally drafted, but the Allies recognized the inconvenience of the\r\n_indeterminacy_ of the burden laid upon Germany and proposed a method by\r\nwhich the final total of claim might be established at an earlier date\r\nthan May 1, 1921. They promised, therefore, that at any time within four\r\nmonths of the signature of the Treaty (that is to say, up to the end of\r\nOctober, 1919), Germany should be at liberty to submit an offer of a\r\nlump sum in settlement of her whole liability as defined in the Treaty,\r\nand within two months thereafter (that is to say, before the end of\r\n1919) the Allies \"will, so far as may be possible, return their answers\r\nto any proposals that may be made.\"\r\n\r\nThis offer is subject to three conditions. \"Firstly, the German\r\nauthorities will be expected, before making such proposals, to confer\r\nwith the representatives of the Powers directly concerned. Secondly,\r\nsuch offers must be unambiguous and must be precise and clear. Thirdly,\r\nthey must accept the categories and the Reparation clauses as matters\r\nsettled beyond discussion.\"\r\n\r\nThe offer, as made, does not appear to contemplate any opening up of the\r\nproblem of Germany's capacity to pay. It is only concerned with the\r\nestablishment of the total bill of claims as defined in the\r\nTreaty--whether (_e.g._) it is $35,000,000,000, $40,000,000,000, or\r\n$50,000,000,000. \"The questions,\" the Allies' reply adds, \"are bare\r\nquestions of fact, namely, the amount of the liabilities, and they are\r\nsusceptible of being treated in this way.\"\r\n\r\nIf the promised negotiations are really conducted on these lines, they\r\nare not likely to be fruitful. It will not be much easier to arrive at\r\nan agreed figure before the end of 1919 that it was at the time of the\r\nConference; and it will not help Germany's financial position to know\r\nfor certain that she is liable for the huge sum which on any computation\r\nthe Treaty liabilities must amount to. These negotiations do offer,\r\nhowever, an opportunity of reopening the whole question of the\r\nReparation payments, although it is hardly to be hoped that at so very\r\nearly a date, public opinion in the countries of the Allies has changed\r\nits mood sufficiently.[144]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI cannot leave this subject as though its just treatment wholly depended\r\neither on our own pledges or on economic facts. The policy of reducing\r\nGermany to servitude for a generation, of degrading the lives of\r\nmillions of human beings, and of depriving a whole nation of happiness\r\nshould be abhorrent and detestable,--abhorrent and detestable, even if\r\nit were possible, even if it enriched ourselves, even if it did not sow\r\nthe decay of the whole civilized life of Europe. Some preach it in the\r\nname of Justice. In the great events of man's history, in the unwinding\r\nof the complex fates of nations Justice is not so simple. And if it\r\nwere, nations are not authorized, by religion or by natural morals, to\r\nvisit on the children of their enemies the misdoings of parents or of\r\nrulers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[76] \"With reservation that any future claims and demands of\r\nthe Allies and the United States of America remain unaffected, the\r\nfollowing financial conditions are required: Reparation for damage done.\r\nWhilst Armistice lasts, no public securities shall be removed by the\r\nenemy which can serve as a pledge to the Allies for recovery or\r\nreparation of war losses. Immediate restitution of cash deposit in\r\nNational Bank of Belgium, and, in general, immediate return of all\r\ndocuments, of specie, stock, shares, paper money, together with plant\r\nfor issue thereof, touching public or private interests in invaded\r\ncountries. Restitution of Russian and Roumanian gold yielded to Germany\r\nor taken by that Power. This gold to be delivered in trust to the Allies\r\nuntil signature of peace.\"\r\n\r\n[77] It is to be noticed, in passing, that they contain nothing\r\nwhich limits the damage to damage inflicted contrary to the recognized\r\nrules of warfare. That is to say, it is permissible to include claims\r\narising out of the legitimate capture of a merchantman at sea, as well\r\nas the costs of illegal submarine warfare.\r\n\r\n[78] Mark-paper or mark-credits owned in ex-occupied territory\r\nby Allied nationals should be included, if at all, in the settlement of\r\nenemy debts, along with other sums owed to Allied nationals, and not in\r\nconnection with reparation.\r\n\r\n[79] A special claim on behalf of Belgium was actually included\r\nIn the Peace Treaty, and was accepted by the German representatives\r\nwithout demur.\r\n\r\n[80] To the British observer, one scene, however, stood out\r\ndistinguished from the rest--the field of Ypres. In that desolate and\r\nghostly spot, the natural color and humors of the landscape and the\r\nclimate seemed designed to express to the traveler the memories of the\r\nground. A visitor to the salient early in November, 1918, when a few\r\nGerman bodies still added a touch of realism and human horror, and the\r\ngreat struggle was not yet certainly ended, could feel there, as nowhere\r\nelse, the present outrage of war, and at the same time the tragic and\r\nsentimental purification which to the future will in some degree\r\ntransform its harshness.\r\n\r\n[81] These notes, estimated to amount to no less than six\r\nthousand million marks, are now a source of embarrassment and great\r\npotential loss to the Belgian Government, inasmuch as on their recovery\r\nof the country they took them over from their nationals in exchange for\r\nBelgian notes at the rate of Fr. 120 = Mk. 1. This rate of exchange, being\r\nsubstantially in excess of the value of the mark-notes at the rate of\r\nexchange current at the time (and enormously in excess of the rate to\r\nwhich the mark notes have since fallen, the Belgian franc being now\r\nworth more than three marks), was the occasion of the smuggling of\r\nmark-notes into Belgium on an enormous scale, to take advantage of the\r\nprofit obtainable. The Belgian Government took this very imprudent step,\r\npartly because they hoped to persuade the Peace Conference to make the\r\nredemption of these bank-notes, at the par of exchange, a first charge\r\non German assets. The Peace Conference held, however, that Reparation\r\nproper must take precedence of the adjustment of improvident banking\r\ntransactions effected at an excessive rate of exchange. The possession\r\nby the Belgian Government of this great mass of German currency, in\r\naddition to an amount of nearly two thousand million marks held by the\r\nFrench Government which they similarly exchanged for the benefit of the\r\npopulation of the invaded areas and of Alsace-Lorraine, is a serious\r\naggravation of the exchange position of the mark. It will certainly be\r\ndesirable for the Belgian and German Governments to come to some\r\narrangement as to its disposal, though this is rendered difficult by the\r\nprior lien held by the Reparation Commission over all German assets\r\navailable for such purposes.\r\n\r\n[82] It should be added, in fairness, that the very high claims\r\nput forward on behalf of Belgium generally include not only devastation\r\nproper, but all kinds of other items, as, for example, the profits and\r\nearnings which Belgians might reasonably have expected to earn if there\r\nhad been no war.\r\n\r\n[83] \"The Wealth and Income of the Chief Powers,\" by J.C. Stamp\r\n(_Journal of the Royal Statistical Society_, July, 1919).\r\n\r\n[84] Other estimates vary from $12,100,000,000 to\r\n$13,400,000,000. See Stamp, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\n[85] This was clearly and courageously pointed out by M.\r\nCharles Gide in _L'Emancipation_ for February, 1919.\r\n\r\n[86] For details of these and other figures, see Stamp, _loc.\r\ncit._\r\n\r\n[87] Even when the extent of the material damage has been\r\nestablished, it will be exceedingly difficult to put a price on it,\r\nwhich must largely depend on the period over which restoration is\r\nspread, and the methods adopted. It would be impossible to make the\r\ndamage good in a year or two at any price, and an attempt to do so at a\r\nrate which was excessive in relation to the amount of labor and\r\nmaterials at hand might force prices up to almost any level. We must, I\r\nthink, assume a cost of labor and materials about equal to that current\r\nin the world generally. In point of fact, however, we may safely assume\r\nthat literal restoration will never be attempted. Indeed, it would be\r\nvery wasteful to do so. Many of the townships were old and unhealthy,\r\nand many of the hamlets miserable. To re-erect the same type of building\r\nin the same places would be foolish. As for the land, the wise course\r\nmay be in some cases to leave long strips of it to Nature for many years\r\nto come. An aggregate money sum should be computed as fairly\r\nrepresenting the value of the material damage, and France should be left\r\nto expend it in the manner she thinks wisest with a view to her economic\r\nenrichment as a whole. The first breeze of this controversy has already\r\nblown through France. A long and inconclusive debate occupied the\r\nChamber during the spring of 1919, as to whether inhabitants of the\r\ndevastated area receiving compensation should be compelled to expend it\r\nin restoring the identical property, or whether they should be free to\r\nuse it as they like. There was evidently a great deal to be said on both\r\nsides; in the former case there would be much hardship and uncertainty\r\nfor owners who could not, many of them, expect to recover the effective\r\nuse of their property perhaps for years to come, and yet would not be\r\nfree to set themselves up elsewhere; on the other hand, if such persons\r\nwere allowed to take their compensation and go elsewhere, the\r\ncountryside of Northern France would never be put right. Nevertheless I\r\nbelieve that the wise course will be to allow great latitude and let\r\neconomic motives take their own course.\r\n\r\n[88] _La Richesse de la France devant la Guerre_, published in\r\n1916.\r\n\r\n[89] _Revue Bleue_, February 3, 1919. This is quoted in a very\r\nvaluable selection of French estimates and expressions of opinion,\r\nforming chapter iv. of _La Liquidation financiËre de la Guerre_, by H.\r\nCharriaut and R. Hacault. The general magnitude of my estimate is\r\nfurther confirmed by the extent of the repairs already effected, as set\r\nforth in a speech delivered by M. Tardieu on October 10, 1919, in which\r\nhe said: \"On September 16 last, of 2246 kilomËtres of railway track\r\ndestroyed, 2016 had been repaired; of 1075 kilomËtres of canal, 700; of\r\n1160 constructions, such as bridges and tunnels, which had been blown\r\nup, 588 had been replaced; of 550,000 houses ruined by bombardment,\r\n60,000 had been rebuilt; and of 1,800,000 hectares of ground rendered\r\nuseless by battle, 400,000 had been recultivated, 200,000 hectares of\r\nwhich are now ready to be sown. Finally, more than 10,000,000 mËtres of\r\nbarbed wire had been removed.\"\r\n\r\n[90] Some of these estimates include allowance for contingent\r\nand immaterial damage as well as for direct material injury.\r\n\r\n[91] A substantial part of this was lost in the service of the\r\nAllies; this must not be duplicated by inclusion both in their claims\r\nand in ours.\r\n\r\n[92] The fact that no separate allowance is made in the above\r\nfor the sinking of 675 fishing vessels of 71,765 tons gross, or for the\r\n1855 vessels of 8,007,967 tons damaged or molested, but not sunk, may be\r\nset off against what may be an excessive figure for replacement cost.\r\n\r\n[93] The losses of the Greek mercantile marine were excessively\r\nhigh, as a result of the dangers of the Mediterranean; but they were\r\nlargely incurred on the service of the other Allies, who paid for them\r\ndirectly or indirectly. The claims of Greece for maritime losses\r\nincurred on the service of her own nationals would not be very\r\nconsiderable.\r\n\r\n[94] There is a reservation in the Peace Treaty on this\r\nquestion. \"The Allied and Associated Powers formally reserve the right\r\nof Russia to obtain from Germany restitution and reparation based on the\r\nprinciples of the present Treaty\" (Art. 116).\r\n\r\n[95] Dr. Diouritch in his \"Economic and Statistical Survey of\r\nthe Southern Slav Nations\" (_Journal of Royal Statistical Society_, May,\r\n1919), quotes some extraordinary figures of the loss of life: \"According\r\nto the official returns, the number of those fallen in battle or died in\r\ncaptivity up to the last Serbian offensive, amounted to 320,000, which\r\nmeans that one half of Serbia's male population, from 18 to 60 years of\r\nage, perished outright in the European War. In addition, the Serbian\r\nMedical Authorities estimate that about 300,000 people have died from\r\ntyphus among the civil population, and the losses among the population\r\ninterned in enemy camps are estimated at 50,000. During the two Serbian\r\nretreats and during the Albanian retreat the losses among children and\r\nyoung people are estimated at 200,000. Lastly, during over three years\r\nof enemy occupation, the losses in lives owing to the lack of proper\r\nfood and medical attention are estimated at 250,000.\" Altogether, he\r\nputs the losses in life at above 1,000,000, or more than one-third of\r\nthe population of Old Serbia.\r\n\r\n[96] _Come si calcola e a quanto ammonta la richezza d'Italia e\r\ndelle altre principali nazioni_, published in 1919.\r\n\r\n[97] Very large claims put forward by the Serbian authorities\r\ninclude many hypothetical items of indirect and non-material damage; but\r\nthese, however real, are not admissible under our present formula.\r\n\r\n[98] Assuming that in her case $1,250,000,000 are included for\r\nthe general expenses of the war defrayed out of loans made to Belgium by\r\nher allies.\r\n\r\n[99] It must be said to Mr. Hughes' honor that he apprehended\r\nfrom the first the bearing of the pre-Armistice negotiations on our\r\nright to demand an indemnity covering the full costs of the war,\r\nprotested against our ever having entered into such engagements, and\r\nmaintained loudly that he had been no party to them and could not\r\nconsider himself bound by them. His indignation may have been partly due\r\nto the fact that Australia, not having been ravaged, would have no\r\nclaims at all under the more limited interpretation of our rights.\r\n\r\n[100] The whole cost of the war has been estimated at from\r\n$120,000,000,000 upwards. This would mean an annual payment for interest\r\n(apart from sinking fund) of $6,000,000,000. Could any expert Committee\r\nhave reported that Germany can pay this sum?\r\n\r\n[101] But unhappily they did not go down with their flags\r\nflying very gloriously. For one reason or another their leaders\r\nmaintained substantial silence. What a different position in the\r\ncountry's estimation they might hold now if they had suffered defeat\r\namidst firm protests against the fraud, chicane, and dishonor of the\r\nwhole proceedings.\r\n\r\n[102] Only after the most painful consideration have I written\r\nthese words. The almost complete absence of protest from the leading\r\nStatesmen of England makes one feel that one must have made some\r\nmistake. But I believe that I know all the facts, and I can discover no\r\nsuch mistake. In any case I have set forth all the relevant engagements\r\nin Chapter IV. and at the beginning of this chapter, so that the reader\r\ncan form his own judgment.\r\n\r\n[103] In conversation with Frenchmen who were private persons\r\nand quite unaffected by political considerations, this aspect became\r\nvery clear. You might persuade them that some current estimates as to\r\nthe amount to be got out of Germany were quite fantastic. Yet at the end\r\nthey would always come back to where they had started: \"But Germany\r\n_must_ pay; for, otherwise, what is to happen to France?\"\r\n\r\n[104] A further paragraph claims the war costs of Belgium \"in\r\naccordance with Germany's pledges, already given, as to complete\r\nrestoration for Belgium.\"\r\n\r\n[105] The challenge of the other Allies, as well as the enemy,\r\nhad to be met; for in view of the limited resources of the latter, the\r\nother Allies had perhaps a greater interest than the enemy in seeing\r\nthat no one of their number established an excessive claim.\r\n\r\n[106] M. Klotz has estimated the French claims on this head at\r\n$15,000,000,000 (75 milliard francs, made up of 13 milliard for\r\nallowances, 60 for pensions, and 2 for widows). If this figure is\r\ncorrect, the others should probably be scaled up also.\r\n\r\n[107] That is to say, I claim for the aggregate figure an\r\naccuracy within 25 per cent.\r\n\r\n[108] In his speech of September 5, 1919, addressed to the\r\nFrench Chamber, M. Klotz estimated the total Allied claims against\r\nGermany under the Treaty at $75,000,000,000, which would accumulate at\r\ninterest until 1921, and be paid off thereafter by 34 annual\r\ninstallments of about $5,000,000,000 each, of which France would receive\r\nabout $2,750,000,000 annually. \"The general effect of the statement\r\n(that France would receive from Germany this annual payment) proved,\" it\r\nis reported, \"appreciably encouraging to the country as a whole, and was\r\nimmediately reflected in the improved tone on the Bourse and throughout\r\nthe business world in France.\" So long as such statements can be\r\naccepted in Paris without protest, there can be no financial or economic\r\nfuture for France, and a catastrophe of disillusion is not far distant.\r\n\r\n[109] As a matter of subjective judgment, I estimate for this\r\nfigure an accuracy of 10 per cent in deficiency and 20 per cent in\r\nexcess, _i.e._ that the result will lie between $32,000,000,000 and\r\n$44,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n[110] Germany is also liable under the Treaty, as an addition\r\nto her liabilities for Reparation, to pay all the costs of the Armies of\r\nOccupation _after_ Peace is signed for the fifteen subsequent years of\r\noccupation. So far as the text of the Treaty goes, there is nothing to\r\nlimit the size of these armies, and France could, therefore, by\r\nquartering the whole of her normal standing army in the occupied area,\r\nshift the charge from her own taxpayers to those of Germany,--though in\r\nreality any such policy would be at the expense not of Germany, who by\r\nhypothesis is already paying for Reparation up to the full limit of her\r\ncapacity, but of France's Allies, who would receive so much less in\r\nrespect of Reparation. A White Paper (Cmd. 240) has, however, been\r\nissued, in which is published a declaration by the Governments of the\r\nUnited States, Great Britain, and France engaging themselves to limit\r\nthe sum payable annually by Germany to cover the cost of occupation to\r\n$60,000,000 \"as soon as the Allied and Associated Powers _concerned_ are\r\nconvinced that the conditions of disarmament by Germany are being\r\nsatisfactorily fulfilled.\" The word which I have italicized is a little\r\nsignificant. The three Powers reserve to themselves the liberty to\r\nmodify this arrangement at any time if they agree that it is necessary.\r\n\r\n[111] Art. 235. The force of this Article is somewhat\r\nstrengthened by Article 251, by virtue of which dispensations may also\r\nbe granted for \"other payments\" as well as for food and raw material.\r\n\r\n[112] This is the effect of Para. 12 (_c_) of Annex II. of the\r\nReparation Chapter, leaving minor complications on one side. The Treaty\r\nfixes the payments in terms of _gold marks_, which are converted in the\r\nabove rate of 20 to $5.\r\n\r\n[113] If, _per impossibile_, Germany discharged $2,500,000,000\r\nin cash or kind by 1921, her annual payments would be at the rate of\r\n$312,500,000 from 1921 to 1925 and of $750,000,000 thereafter.\r\n\r\n[114] Para. 16 of Annex II. of The Reparation Chapter. There is\r\nalso an obscure provision by which interest may be charged \"on sums\r\narising out of _material damage_ as from November 11, 1918, up to May 1,\r\n1921.\" This seems to differentiate damage to property from damage to the\r\nperson in favor of the former. It does not affect Pensions and\r\nAllowances, the cost of which is capitalized as at the date of the\r\ncoming into force of the Treaty.\r\n\r\n[115] On the assumption which no one supports and even the most\r\noptimistic fear to be unplausible, that Germany can pay the full charge\r\nfor interest and sinking fund _from the outset_, the annual payment\r\nwould amount to $2,400,000,000.\r\n\r\n[116] Under Para. 13 of Annex II. unanimity is required (i.)\r\nfor any postponement beyond 1930 of installments due between 1921 and\r\n1926, and (ii.) for any postponement for more than three years of\r\ninstalments due after 1926. Further, under Art. 234, the Commission may\r\nnot cancel any part of the indebtedness without the specific authority\r\nof _all_ the Governments represented on the Commission.\r\n\r\n[117] On July 23, 1914, the amount was $339,000,000.\r\n\r\n[118] Owing to the very high premium which exists on German\r\nsilver coin, as the combined result of the depreciation of the mark and\r\nthe appreciation of silver, it is highly improbable that it will be\r\npossible to extract such coin out of the pockets of the people. But it\r\nmay gradually leak over the frontier by the agency of private\r\nspeculators, and thus indirectly benefit the German exchange position as\r\na whole.\r\n\r\n[119] The Allies made the supply of foodstuffs to Germany\r\nduring the Armistice, mentioned above, conditional on the provisional\r\ntransfer to them of the greater part of the Mercantile Marine, to be\r\noperated by them for the purpose of shipping foodstuffs to Europe\r\ngenerally, and to Germany in particular. The reluctance of the Germans\r\nto agree to this was productive of long and dangerous delays in the\r\nsupply of food, but the abortive Conferences of TrËves and Spa (January\r\n16, February 14-16, and March 4-5, 1919) were at last followed by the\r\nAgreement of Brussels (March 14, 1919). The unwillingness of the Germans\r\nto conclude was mainly due to the lack of any absolute guarantee on the\r\npart of the Allies that, if they surrendered the ships, they would get\r\nthe food. But assuming reasonable good faith on the part of the latter\r\n(their behavior in respect of certain other clauses of the Armistice,\r\nhowever, had not been impeccable and gave the enemy some just grounds\r\nfor suspicion), their demand was not an improper one; for without the\r\nGerman ships the business of transporting the food would have been\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, and the German ships surrendered or their\r\nequivalent were in fact almost wholly employed in transporting food to\r\nGermany itself. Up to June 30, 1919, 176 German ships of 1,025,388 gross\r\ntonnage had been surrendered, to the Allies in accordance with the\r\nBrussels Agreement.\r\n\r\n[120] The amount of tonnage transferred may be rather greater\r\nand the value per ton rather less. The aggregate value involved is not\r\nlikely, however, to be less than $500,000,000 or greater than\r\n$750,000,000.\r\n\r\n[121] This census was carried out by virtue of a Decree of\r\nAugust 23, 1918. On March 22, 1917, the German Government acquired\r\ncomplete control over the utilization of foreign securities in German\r\npossession; and in May, 1917, it began to exercise these powers for the\r\nmobilization of certain Swedish, Danish, and Swiss securities.\r\n\r\n[122]  1892.

This may also be the case with some of the other\r\nestimates.\r\n\r\n[C] This estimate, given in the _Weltwirtschaftszeitung_ (June\r\n13, 1919), is an estimate of the value of Germany's foreign investments\r\nas at the outbreak of war.\r\n\r\n[123] I have made no deduction for securities in the ownership\r\nof Alsace-Lorrainers and others who have now ceased to be German\r\nnationals.\r\n\r\n[124] In all these estimates, I am conscious of being driven by\r\na fear of overstating the case against the Treaty, of giving figures in\r\nexcess of my own real judgment. There is a great difference between\r\nputting down on paper fancy estimates of Germany's resources and\r\nactually extracting contributions in the form of cash. I do not myself\r\nbelieve that the Reparation Commission will secure real resources from\r\nthe above items by May, 1921, even as great as the _lower_ of the two\r\nfigures given above.\r\n\r\n[125] The Treaty (see Art. 114) leaves it very dubious how far\r\nthe Danish Government is under an obligation to make payments to the\r\nReparation Commission in respect of its acquisition of Schleswig. They\r\nmight, for instance, arrange for various offsets such as the value of\r\nthe mark notes held by the inhabitants of ceded areas. In any case the\r\namount of money involved is quite small. The Danish Government is\r\nraising a loan for $33,000,000 (kr. 120,000,000) for the joint purposes\r\nof \"taking over Schleswig's share of the German debt, for buying German\r\npublic property, for helping the Schleswig population, and for settling\r\nthe currency question.\"\r\n\r\n[126] Here again my own judgment would carry me much further\r\nand I should doubt the possibility of Germany's exports equaling her\r\nimports during this period. But the statement in the text goes far\r\nenough for the purpose of my argument.\r\n\r\n[127] It has been estimated that the cession of territory to\r\nFrance, apart from the loss of Upper Silesia, may reduce Germany's\r\nannual pre-war production of steel ingots from 20,000,000 tons to\r\n14,000,000 tons, and increase France's capacity from 5,000,000 tons to\r\n11,000,000 tons.\r\n\r\n[128] Germany's exports of sugar in 1913 amounted to 1,110,073\r\ntons of the value of $65,471,500, of which 838,583 tons were exported to\r\nthe United Kingdom at a value of $45,254,000. These figures were in\r\nexcess of the normal, the average total exports for the five years\r\nending 1913 being about $50,000,000.\r\n\r\n[129] The necessary price adjustment, which is required, on\r\nboth sides of this account, will be made _en bloc_ later.\r\n\r\n[130] If the amount of the sinking fund be reduced, and the\r\nannual payment is continued over a greater number of years, the present\r\nvalue--so powerful is the operation of compound interest--cannot be\r\nmaterially increased. A payment of $500,000,000 annually _in\r\nperpetuity_, assuming interest, as before, at 5 per cent, would only\r\nraise the present value to $10,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n[131] As an example of public misapprehension on economic\r\naffairs, the following letter from Sir Sidney Low to _The Times_ of the\r\n3rd December, 1918, deserves quotation: \"I have seen authoritative\r\nestimates which place the gross value of Germany's mineral and chemical\r\nresources as high as $1,250,000,000,000 or even more; and the Ruhr basin\r\nmines alone are said to be worth over $225,000,000,000. It is certain,\r\nat any rate, that the capital value of these natural supplies is much\r\ngreater than the total war debts of all the Allied States. Why should\r\nnot some portion of this wealth be diverted for a sufficient period from\r\nits present owners and assigned to the peoples whom Germany has\r\nassailed, deported, and injured? The Allied Governments might justly\r\nrequire Germany to surrender to them the use of such of her mines, and\r\nmineral deposits as would yield, say, from $500,000,000 to\r\n$1,000,000,000 annually for the next 30, 40, or 50 years. By this means\r\nwe could obtain sufficient compensation from Germany without unduly\r\nstimulating her manufactures and export trade to our detriment.\" It is\r\nnot clear why, if Germany has wealth exceeding $1,250,000,000,000. Sir\r\nSidney Low is content with the trifling sum of $500,000,000 to\r\n$1,000,000,000 annually. But his letter is an admirable _reductio ad\r\nabsurdum_ of a certain line of thought. While a mode of calculation,\r\nwhich estimates the value of coal miles deep in the bowels of the earth\r\nas high as in a coal scuttle, of an annual lease of $5000 for 999 years\r\nat $4,995,000 and of a field (presumably) at the value of all the crops\r\nit will grow to the end of recorded time, opens up great possibilities,\r\nit is also double-edged. If Germany's total resources are worth\r\n$1,250,000,000,000, those she will part with in the cession of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine and Upper Silesia should be more than sufficient to pay\r\nthe entire costs of the war and reparation together. In point of fact,\r\nthe _present_ market value of all the mines in Germany of every kind has\r\nbeen estimated at $1,500,000,000, or a little more than one-thousandth\r\npart of Sir Sidney Low's expectations.\r\n\r\n[132] The conversion at par of 5,000 million marks overstates,\r\nby reason of the existing depreciation of the mark, the present money\r\nburden of the actual pensions payments, but not, in all probability, the\r\nreal loss of national productivity as a result of the casualties\r\nsuffered in the war.\r\n\r\n[133] It cannot be overlooked, in passing, that in its results\r\non a country's surplus productivity a lowering of the standard of life\r\nacts both ways. Moreover, we are without experience of the psychology of\r\na white race under conditions little short of servitude. It is, however,\r\ngenerally supposed that if the whole of a man's surplus production is\r\ntaken from him, his efficiency and his industry are diminished, The\r\nentrepreneur and the inventor will not contrive, the trader and the\r\nshopkeeper will not save, the laborer will not toil, if the fruits of\r\ntheir industry are set aside, not for the benefit of their children,\r\ntheir old age, their pride, or their position, but for the enjoyment of\r\na foreign conqueror.\r\n\r\n[134] In the course of the compromises and delays of the\r\nConference, there were many questions on which, in order to reach any\r\nconclusion at all, it was necessary to leave a margin of vagueness and\r\nuncertainty. The whole method of the Conference tended towards\r\nthis,--the Council of Four wanted, not so much a settlement, as a\r\ntreaty. On political and territorial questions the tendency was to leave\r\nthe final arbitrament to the League of Nations. But on financial and\r\neconomic questions, the final decision has generally be a left with the\r\nReparation Commission,--in spite of its being an executive body composed\r\nof interested parties.\r\n\r\n[135] The sum to be paid by Austria for Reparation is left to\r\nthe absolute discretion of the Reparation Commission, no determinate\r\nfigure of any kind being mentioned in the text of the Treaty Austrian\r\nquestions are to be handled by a special section of the Reparation\r\nCommission, but the section will have no powers except such as the main\r\nCommission may delegate.\r\n\r\n[136] Bulgaria is to pay an indemnity of $450,000,000 by\r\nhalf-yearly instalments, beginning July 1, 1920. These sums will be\r\ncollected, on behalf of the Reparation Commission, by an Inter-Ally\r\nCommission of Control, with its seat at Sofia. In some respects the\r\nBulgarian Inter-Ally Commission appears to have powers and authority\r\nindependent of the Reparation Commission, but it is to act,\r\nnevertheless, as the agent of the latter, and is authorized to tender\r\nadvice to the Reparation Commission as to, for example, the reduction of\r\nthe half-yearly instalments.\r\n\r\n[137] Under the Treaty this is the function of any body\r\nappointed for the purpose by the principal Allied and Associated\r\nGovernments, and not necessarily of the Reparation Commission. But it\r\nmay be presumed that no second body will be established for this special\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[138] At the date of writing no treaties with these countries\r\nhave been drafted. It is possible that Turkey might be dealt with by a\r\nseparate Commission.\r\n\r\n[139] This appears to me to be in effect the position (if this\r\nparagraph means anything at all), in spite of the following disclaimer\r\nof such intentions in the Allies' reply:--\"Nor does Paragraph 12(b) of\r\nAnnex II. give the Commission powers to prescribe or enforce taxes or to\r\ndictate the character of the German budget.\"\r\n\r\n[140] Whatever that may mean.\r\n\r\n[141] Assuming that the capital sum is discharged evenly over a\r\nperiod as short as thirty-three years, this has the effect of _halving_\r\nthe burden as compared with the payments required on the basis of 5 per\r\ncent interest on the outstanding capital.\r\n\r\n[142] I forbear to outline the further details of the German\r\noffer as the above are the essential points.\r\n\r\n[143] For this reason it is not strictly comparable with my\r\nestimate of Germany's capacity in an earlier section of this chapter,\r\nwhich estimate is on the basis of Germany's condition as it will be when\r\nthe rest of the Treaty has come into effect.\r\n\r\n[144] Owing to delays on the part of the Allies in ratifying\r\nthe Treaty, the Reparation Commission had not yet been formally\r\nconstituted by the end of October, 1919. So far as I am aware,\r\ntherefore, nothing has been done to make the above offer effective. But,\r\nperhaps in view of the circumstances, there has been an extension of the\r\ndate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nEUROPE AFTER THE TREATY\r\n\r\n\r\nThis chapter must be one of pessimism. The Treaty includes no provisions\r\nfor the economic rehabilitation of Europe,--nothing to make the defeated\r\nCentral Empires into good neighbors, nothing to stabilize the new States\r\nof Europe, nothing to reclaim Russia; nor does it promote in any way a\r\ncompact of economic solidarity amongst the Allies themselves; no\r\narrangement was reached at Paris for restoring the disordered finances\r\nof France and Italy, or to adjust the systems of the Old World and the\r\nNew.\r\n\r\nThe Council of Four paid no attention to these issues, being preoccupied\r\nwith others,--Clemenceau to crush the economic life of his enemy, Lloyd\r\nGeorge to do a deal and bring home something which would pass muster for\r\na week, the President to do nothing that was not just and right. It is\r\nan extraordinary fact that the fundamental economic problems of a Europe\r\nstarving and disintegrating before their eyes, was the one question in\r\nwhich it was impossible to arouse the interest of the Four. Reparation\r\nwas their main excursion into the economic field, and they settled it\r\nas a problem of theology, of polities, of electoral chicane, from every\r\npoint of view except that of the economic future of the States whose\r\ndestiny they were handling.\r\n\r\nI leave, from this point onwards, Paris, the Conference, and the Treaty,\r\nbriefly to consider the present situation of Europe, as the War and the\r\nPeace have made it; and it will no longer be part of my purpose to\r\ndistinguish between the inevitable fruits of the War and the avoidable\r\nmisfortunes of the Peace.\r\n\r\nThe essential facts of the situation, as I see them, are expressed\r\nsimply. Europe consists of the densest aggregation of population in the\r\nhistory of the world. This population is accustomed to a relatively high\r\nstandard of life, in which, even now, some sections of it anticipate\r\nimprovement rather than deterioration. In relation to other continents\r\nEurope is not self-sufficient; in particular it cannot feed Itself.\r\nInternally the population is not evenly distributed, but much of it is\r\ncrowded into a relatively small number of dense industrial centers. This\r\npopulation secured for itself a livelihood before the war, without much\r\nmargin of surplus, by means of a delicate and immensely complicated\r\norganization, of which the foundations were supported by coal, iron,\r\ntransport, and an unbroken supply of imported food and raw materials\r\nfrom other continents. By the destruction of this organization and the\r\ninterruption of the stream of supplies, a part of this population is\r\ndeprived of its means of livelihood. Emigration is not open to the\r\nredundant surplus. For it would take years to transport them overseas,\r\neven, which is not the case, if countries could be found which were\r\nready to receive them. The danger confronting us, therefore, is the\r\nrapid depression of the standard of life of the European populations to\r\na point which will mean actual starvation for some (a point already\r\nreached in Russia and approximately reached in Austria). Men will not\r\nalways die quietly. For starvation, which brings to some lethargy and a\r\nhelpless despair, drives other temperaments to the nervous instability\r\nof hysteria and to a mad despair. And these in their distress may\r\noverturn the remnants of organization, and submerge civilization itself\r\nin their attempts to satisfy desperately the overwhelming needs of the\r\nindividual. This is the danger against which all our resources and\r\ncourage and idealism must now co-operate.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th May, 1919, Count Brockdorff-Rantzau addressed to the Peace\r\nConference of the Allied and Associated Powers the Report of the German\r\nEconomic Commission charged with the study of the effect of the\r\nconditions of Peace on the situation of the German population. \"In the\r\ncourse of the last two generations,\" they reported, \"Germany has become\r\ntransformed from an agricultural State to an industrial State. So long\r\nas she was an agricultural State, Germany could feed forty million\r\ninhabitants. As an industrial State she could insure the means of\r\nsubsistence for a population of sixty-seven millions; and in 1913 the\r\nimportation of foodstuffs amounted, in round figures, to twelve million\r\ntons. Before the war a total of fifteen million persons in Germany\r\nprovided for their existence by foreign trade, navigation, and the use,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, of foreign raw material.\" After rehearsing the\r\nmain relevant provisions of the Peace Treaty the report continues:\r\n\"After this diminution of her products, after the economic depression\r\nresulting from the loss of her colonies, her merchant fleet and her\r\nforeign investments, Germany will not be in a position to import from\r\nabroad an adequate quantity of raw material. An enormous part of German\r\nindustry will, therefore, be condemned inevitably to destruction. The\r\nneed of importing foodstuffs will increase considerably at the same time\r\nthat the possibility of satisfying this demand is as greatly diminished.\r\nIn a very short time, therefore, Germany will not be in a position to\r\ngive bread and work to her numerous millions of inhabitants, who are\r\nprevented from earning their livelihood by navigation and trade. These\r\npersons should emigrate, but this is a material impossibility, all the\r\nmore because many countries and the most important ones will oppose any\r\nGerman immigration. To put the Peace conditions into execution would\r\nlogically involve, therefore, the loss of several millions of persons in\r\nGermany. This catastrophe would not be long in coming about, seeing that\r\nthe health of the population has been broken down during the War by the\r\nBlockade, and during the Armistice by the aggravation of the Blockade of\r\nfamine. No help, however great, or over however long a period it were\r\ncontinued, could prevent those deaths _en masse_.\" \"We do not know, and\r\nindeed we doubt,\" the report concludes, \"whether the Delegates of the\r\nAllied and Associated Powers realize the inevitable consequences which\r\nwill take place if Germany, an industrial State, very thickly populated,\r\nclosely bound up with the economic system of the world, and under the\r\nnecessity of importing enormous quantities of raw material and\r\nfoodstuffs, suddenly finds herself pushed back to the phase of her\r\ndevelopment, which corresponds to her economic condition and the numbers\r\nof her population as they were half a century ago. Those who sign this\r\nTreaty will sign the death sentence of many millions of German men,\r\nwomen and children.\"\r\n\r\nI know of no adequate answer to these words. The indictment is at least\r\nas true of the Austrian, as of the German, settlement. This is the\r\nfundamental problem in front of us, before which questions of\r\nterritorial adjustment and the balance of European power are\r\ninsignificant. Some of the catastrophes of past history, which have\r\nthrown back human progress for centuries, have been due to the reactions\r\nfollowing on the sudden termination, whether in the course of nature or\r\nby the act of man, of temporarily favorable conditions which have\r\npermitted the growth of population beyond what could be provided for\r\nwhen the favorable conditions were at an end.\r\n\r\nThe significant features of the immediate situation can be grouped under\r\nthree heads: first, the absolute falling off, for the time being, in\r\nEurope's internal productivity; second, the breakdown of transport and\r\nexchange by means of which its products could be conveyed where they\r\nwere most wanted; and third, the inability of Europe to purchase its\r\nusual supplies from overseas.\r\n\r\nThe decrease of productivity cannot be easily estimated, and may be the\r\nsubject of exaggeration. But the _primâ facie_ evidence of it is\r\noverwhelming, and this factor has been the main burden of Mr. Hoover's\r\nwell-considered warnings. A variety of causes have produced it;—violent\r\nand prolonged internal disorder as in Russia and Hungary; the creation\r\nof new governments and their inexperience in the readjustment of\r\neconomic relations, as in Poland and Czecho-Slovakia; the loss\r\nthroughout the Continent of efficient labor, through the casualties of\r\nwar or the continuance of mobilization; the falling-off in efficiency\r\nthrough continued underfeeding in the Central Empires; the exhaustion\r\nof the soil from lack of the usual applications of artificial manures\r\nthroughout the course of the war; the unsettlement of the minds of the\r\nlaboring classes on the fundamental economic issues of their lives. But\r\nabove all (to quote Mr. Hoover), \"there is a great relaxation of effort\r\nas the reflex of physical exhaustion of large sections of the\r\npopulation from privation and the mental and physical strain of the\r\nwar.\" Many persons are for one reason or another out of employment\r\naltogether. According to Mr. Hoover, a summary of the unemployment\r\nbureaus in Europe in July, 1919, showed that 15,000,000 families were\r\nreceiving unemployment allowances in one form or another, and were\r\nbeing paid in the main by a constant inflation of currency. In Germany\r\nthere is the added deterrent to labor and to capital (in so far as the\r\nReparation terms are taken literally), that anything, which they may\r\nproduce beyond the barest level of subsistence, will for years to come\r\nbe taken away from them.\r\n\r\nSuch definite data as we possess do not add much, perhaps, to the\r\ngeneral picture of decay. But I will remind the reader of one or two of\r\nthem. The coal production of Europe as a whole is estimated to have\r\nfallen off by 30 per cent; and upon coal the greater part of the\r\nindustries of Europe and the whole of her transport system depend.\r\nWhereas before the war Germany produced 85 per cent of the total food\r\nconsumed by her inhabitants, the productivity of the soil is now\r\ndiminished by 40 per cent and the effective quality of the live-stock by\r\n55 per cent.[145] Of the European countries which formerly possessed a\r\nlarge exportable surplus, Russia, as much by reason of deficient\r\ntransport as of diminished output, may herself starve. Hungary, apart\r\nfrom her other troubles, has been pillaged by the Romanians immediately\r\nafter harvest. Austria will have consumed the whole of her own harvest\r\nfor 1919 before the end of the calendar year. The figures are almost too\r\noverwhelming to carry conviction to our minds; if they were not quite so\r\nbad, our effective belief in them might be stronger.\r\n\r\nBut even when coal can be got and grain harvested, the breakdown of the\r\nEuropean railway system prevents their carriage; and even when goods can\r\nbe manufactured, the breakdown of the European currency system prevents\r\ntheir sale. I have already described the losses, by war and under the\r\nArmistice surrenders, to the transport system of Germany. But even so,\r\nGermany's position, taking account of her power of replacement by\r\nmanufacture, is probably not so serious as that of some of her\r\nneighbors. In Russia (about which, however, we have very little exact or\r\naccurate information) the condition of the rolling-stock is believed to\r\nbe altogether desperate, and one of the most fundamental factors in her\r\nexisting economic disorder. And in Poland, Roumania, and Hungary the\r\nposition is not much better. Yet modern industrial life essentially\r\ndepends on efficient transport facilities, and the population which\r\nsecured its livelihood by these means cannot continue to live without\r\nthem. The breakdown of currency, and the distrust in its purchasing\r\nvalue, is an aggravation of these evils which must be discussed in a\r\nlittle more detail in connection with foreign trade.\r\n\r\nWhat then is our picture of Europe? A country population able to support\r\nlife on the fruits of its own agricultural production but without the\r\naccustomed surplus for the towns, and also (as a result of the lack of\r\nimported materials and so of variety and amount in the saleable\r\nmanufactures of the towns) without the usual incentives to market food\r\nin return for other wares; an industrial population unable to keep its\r\nstrength for lack of food, unable to earn a livelihood for lack of\r\nmaterials, and so unable to make good by imports from abroad the failure\r\nof productivity at home. Yet, according to Mr. Hoover, \"a rough estimate\r\nwould indicate that the population of Europe is at least 100,000,000\r\ngreater than can be supported without imports, and must live by the\r\nproduction and distribution of exports.\"\r\n\r\nThe problem of the re-inauguration of the perpetual circle of production\r\nand exchange in foreign trade leads me to a necessary digression on the\r\ncurrency situation of Europe.\r\n\r\nLenin is said to have declared that the best way to destroy the\r\nCapitalist System was to debauch the currency. By a continuing process\r\nof inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an\r\nimportant part of the wealth of their citizens. By this method they not\r\nonly confiscate, but they confiscate _arbitrarily_; and, while the\r\nprocess impoverishes many, it actually enriches some. The sight of this\r\narbitrary rearrangement of riches strikes not only at security, but at\r\nconfidence in the equity of the existing distribution of wealth. Those\r\nto whom the system brings windfalls, beyond their deserts and even\r\nbeyond their expectations or desires, become \"profiteers,\", who are the\r\nobject of the hatred of the bourgeoisie, whom the inflationism has\r\nimpoverished, not less than of the proletariat. As the inflation\r\nproceeds and the real value of the currency fluctuates wildly from\r\nmonth to month, all permanent relations between debtors and creditors,\r\nwhich form the ultimate foundation of capitalism, become so utterly\r\ndisordered as to be almost meaningless; and the process of\r\nwealth-getting degenerates into a gamble and a lottery.\r\n\r\nLenin was certainly right. There is no subtler, no surer means of\r\noverturning the existing basis of society than to debauch the currency.\r\nThe process engages all the hidden forces of economic law on the side of\r\ndestruction, and does it in a manner which not one man in a million is\r\nable to diagnose.\r\n\r\nIn the latter stages of the war all the belligerent governments\r\npractised, from necessity or incompetence, what a Bolshevist might have\r\ndone from design. Even now, when the war is over, most of them continue\r\nout of weakness the same malpractices. But further, the Governments of\r\nEurope, being many of them at this moment reckless in their methods as\r\nwell as weak, seek to direct on to a class known as \"profiteers\" the\r\npopular indignation against the more obvious consequences of their\r\nvicious methods. These \"profiteers\" are, broadly speaking, the\r\nentrepreneur class of capitalists, that is to say, the active and\r\nconstructive element in the whole capitalist society, who in a period of\r\nrapidly rising prices cannot help but get rich quick whether they wish\r\nit or desire it or not. If prices are continually rising, every trader\r\nwho has purchased for stock or owns property and plant inevitably makes\r\nprofits. By directing hatred against this class, therefore, the European\r\nGovernments are carrying a step further the fatal process which the\r\nsubtle mind of Lenin had consciously conceived. The profiteers are a\r\nconsequence and not a cause of rising prices. By combining a popular\r\nhatred of the class of entrepreneurs with the blow already given to\r\nsocial security by the violent and arbitrary disturbance of contract and\r\nof the established equilibrium of wealth which is the inevitable result\r\nof inflation, these Governments are fast rendering impossible a\r\ncontinuance of the social and economic order of the nineteenth century.\r\nBut they have no plan for replacing it.\r\n\r\nWe are thus faced in Europe with the spectacle of an extraordinary\r\nweakness on the part of the great capitalist class, which has emerged\r\nfrom the industrial triumphs of the nineteenth century, and seemed a\r\nvery few years ago our all-powerful master. The terror and personal\r\ntimidity of the individuals of this class is now so great, their\r\nconfidence in their place in society and in their necessity to the\r\nsocial organism so diminished, that they are the easy victims of\r\nintimidation. This was not so in England twenty-five years ago, any\r\nmore than it is now in the United States. Then the capitalists believed\r\nin themselves, in their value to society, in the propriety of their\r\ncontinued existence in the full enjoyment of their riches and the\r\nunlimited exercise of their power. Now they tremble before every\r\ninsult;--call them pro-Germans, international financiers, or profiteers,\r\nand they will give you any ransom you choose to ask not to speak of them\r\nso harshly. They allow themselves to be ruined and altogether undone by\r\ntheir own instruments, governments of their own making, and a press of\r\nwhich they are the proprietors. Perhaps it is historically true that no\r\norder of society ever perishes save by its own hand. In the complexer\r\nworld of Western Europe the Immanent Will may achieve its ends more\r\nsubtly and bring in the revolution no less inevitably through a Klotz or\r\na George than by the intellectualisms, too ruthless and self-conscious\r\nfor us, of the bloodthirsty philosophers of Russia.\r\n\r\nThe inflationism of the currency systems of Europe has proceeded to\r\nextraordinary lengths. The various belligerent Governments, unable, or\r\ntoo timid or too short-sighted to secure from loans or taxes the\r\nresources they required, have printed notes for the balance. In Russia\r\nand Austria-Hungary this process has reached a point where for the\r\npurposes of foreign trade the currency is practically valueless. The\r\nPolish mark can be bought for about three cents and the Austrian crown\r\nfor less than two cents, but they cannot be sold at all. The German mark\r\nis worth less than four cents on the exchanges. In most of the other\r\ncountries of Eastern and South-Eastern Europe the real position is\r\nnearly as bad. The currency of Italy has fallen to little more than a\r\nhalf of its nominal value in spite of its being still subject to some\r\ndegree of regulation; French currency maintains an uncertain market; and\r\neven sterling is seriously diminished in present value and impaired in\r\nits future prospects.\r\n\r\nBut while these currencies enjoy a precarious value abroad, they have\r\nnever entirely lost, not even in Russia, their purchasing power at home.\r\nA sentiment of trust in the legal money of the State is so deeply\r\nimplanted in the citizens of all countries that they cannot but believe\r\nthat some day this money must recover a part at least of its former\r\nvalue. To their minds it appears that value is inherent in money as\r\nsuch, and they do not apprehend that the real wealth, which this money\r\nmight have stood for, has been dissipated once and for all. This\r\nsentiment is supported by the various legal regulations with which the\r\nGovernments endeavor to control internal prices, and so to preserve some\r\npurchasing power for their legal tender. Thus the force of law\r\npreserves a measure of immediate purchasing power over some commodities\r\nand the force of sentiment and custom maintains, especially amongst\r\npeasants, a willingness to hoard paper which is really worthless.\r\n\r\nThe presumption of a spurious value for the currency, by the force of\r\nlaw expressed in the regulation of prices, contains in itself, however,\r\nthe seeds of final economic decay, and soon dries up the sources of\r\nultimate supply. If a man is compelled to exchange the fruits of his\r\nlabors for paper which, as experience soon teaches him, he cannot use to\r\npurchase what he requires at a price comparable to that which he has\r\nreceived for his own products, he will keep his produce for himself,\r\ndispose of it to his friends and neighbors as a favor, or relax his\r\nefforts in producing it. A system of compelling the exchange of\r\ncommodities at what is not their real relative value not only relaxes\r\nproduction, but leads finally to the waste and inefficiency of barter.\r\nIf, however, a government refrains from regulation and allows matters to\r\ntake their course, essential commodities soon attain a level of price\r\nout of the reach of all but the rich, the worthlessness of the money\r\nbecomes apparent, and the fraud upon the public can be concealed no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nThe effect on foreign trade of price-regulation and profiteer-hunting\r\nas cures for inflation is even worse. Whatever may be the case at home,\r\nthe currency must soon reach its real level abroad, with the result that\r\nprices inside and outside the country lose their normal adjustment. The\r\nprice of imported commodities, when converted at the current rate of\r\nexchange, is far in excess of the local price, so that many essential\r\ngoods will not be imported at all by private agency, and must be\r\nprovided by the government, which, in re-selling the goods below cost\r\nprice, plunges thereby a little further into insolvency. The bread\r\nsubsidies, now almost universal throughout Europe, are the leading\r\nexample of this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nThe countries of Europe fall into two distinct groups at the present\r\ntime as regards their manifestations of what is really the same evil\r\nthroughout, according as they have been cut off from international\r\nintercourse by the Blockade, or have had their imports paid for out of\r\nthe resources of their allies. I take Germany as typical of the first,\r\nand France and Italy of the second.\r\n\r\nThe note circulation of Germany is about ten times[146] what it was\r\nbefore the war. The value of the mark in terms of gold is about\r\none-eighth of its former value. As world-prices in terms of gold are\r\nmore than double what they were, it follows that mark-prices inside\r\nGermany ought to be from sixteen to twenty times their pre-war level if\r\nthey are to be in adjustment and proper conformity with prices outside\r\nGermany.[147] But this is not the case. In spite of a very great rise in\r\nGerman prices, they probably do not yet average much more than five\r\ntimes their former level, so far as staple commodities are concerned;\r\nand it is impossible that they should rise further except with a\r\nsimultaneous and not less violent adjustment of the level of money\r\nwages. The existing maladjustment hinders in two ways (apart from other\r\nobstacles) that revival of the import trade which is the essential\r\npreliminary of the economic reconstruction of the country. In the first\r\nplace, imported commodities are beyond the purchasing power of the great\r\nmass of the population,[148] and the flood of imports which might have\r\nbeen expected to succeed the raising of the blockade was not in fact\r\ncommercially possible.[149] In the second place, it is a hazardous\r\nenterprise for a merchant or a manufacturer to purchase with a foreign\r\ncredit material for which, when he has imported it or manufactured it,\r\nhe will receive mark currency of a quite uncertain and possibly\r\nunrealizable value. This latter obstacle to the revival of trade is one\r\nwhich easily escapes notice and deserves a little attention. It is\r\nimpossible at the present time to say what the mark will be worth in\r\nterms of foreign currency three or six months or a year hence, and the\r\nexchange market can quote no reliable figure. It may be the case,\r\ntherefore, that a German merchant, careful of his future credit and\r\nreputation, who is actually offered a short period credit in terms of\r\nsterling or dollars, may be reluctant and doubtful whether to accept it.\r\nHe will owe sterling or dollars, but he will sell his product for marks,\r\nand his power, when the time comes, to turn these marks into the\r\ncurrency in which he has to repay his debt is entirely problematic.\r\nBusiness loses its genuine character and becomes no better than a\r\nspeculation in the exchanges, the fluctuations in which entirely\r\nobliterate the normal profits of commerce.\r\n\r\nThere are therefore three separate obstacles to the revival of trade: a\r\nmaladjustment between internal prices and international prices, a lack\r\nof individual credit abroad wherewith to buy the raw materials needed to\r\nsecure the working capital and to re-start the circle of exchange, and a\r\ndisordered currency system which renders credit operations hazardous or\r\nimpossible quite apart from the ordinary risks of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe note circulation of France is more than six times its pre-war level.\r\nThe exchange value of the franc in terms of gold is a little less than\r\ntwo-thirds its former value; that is to say, the value of the franc has\r\nnot fallen in proportion to the increased volume of the currency.[150]\r\nThis apparently superior situation of France is due to the fact that\r\nuntil recently a very great part of her imports have not been paid for,\r\nbut have been covered by loans from the Governments of Great Britain and\r\nthe United States. This has allowed a want of equilibrium between\r\nexports and imports to be established, which is becoming a very serious\r\nfactor, now that the outside assistance is being gradually discontinued.\r\nThe internal economy of France and its price level in relation to the\r\nnote circulation and the foreign exchanges is at present based on an\r\nexcess of imports over exports which cannot possibly continue. Yet it is\r\ndifficult to see how the position can be readjusted except by a lowering\r\nof the standard of consumption in France, which, even if it is only\r\ntemporary, will provoke a great deal of discontent.[151]\r\n\r\nThe situation of Italy is not very different. There the note circulation\r\nis five or six times its pre-war level, and the exchange value of the\r\nlira in terms of gold about half its former value. Thus the adjustment\r\nof the exchange to the volume of the note circulation has proceeded\r\nfurther in Italy than in France. On the other hand, Italy's \"invisible\"\r\nreceipts, from emigrant remittances and the expenditure of tourists,\r\nhave been very injuriously affected; the disruption of Austria has\r\ndeprived her of an important market; and her peculiar dependence on\r\nforeign shipping and on imported raw materials of every kind has laid\r\nher open to special injury from the increase of world prices. For all\r\nthese reasons her position is grave, and her excess of imports as\r\nserious a symptom as in the case of France.[152]\r\n\r\nThe existing inflation and the maladjustment of international trade are\r\naggravated, both in France and in Italy, by the unfortunate budgetary\r\nposition of the Governments of these countries.\r\n\r\nIn France the failure to impose taxation is notorious. Before the war\r\nthe aggregate French and British budgets, and also the average taxation\r\nper head, were about equal; but in France no substantial effort has been\r\nmade to cover the increased expenditure. \"Taxes increased in Great\r\nBritain during the war,\" it has been estimated, \"from 95 francs per head\r\nto 265 francs, whereas the increase in France was only from 90 to 103\r\nfrancs.\" The taxation voted in France for the financial year ending June\r\n30, 1919, was less than half the estimated normal _post-bellum_\r\nexpenditure. The normal budget for the future cannot be put below\r\n$4,400,000,000 (22 milliard francs), and may exceed this figure; but\r\neven for the fiscal year 1919-20 the estimated receipts from taxation\r\ndo not cover much more than half this amount. The French Ministry of\r\nFinance have no plan or policy whatever for meeting this prodigious\r\ndeficit, except the expectation of receipts from Germany on a scale\r\nwhich the French officials themselves know to be baseless. In the\r\nmeantime they are helped by sales of war material and surplus American\r\nstocks and do not scruple, even in the latter half of 1919, to meet the\r\ndeficit by the yet further expansion of the note issue of the Bank of\r\nFrance.[153]\r\n\r\nThe budgetary position of Italy is perhaps a little superior to that of\r\nFrance. Italian finance throughout the war was more enterprising than\r\nthe French, and far greater efforts were made to impose taxation and pay\r\nfor the war. Nevertheless Signor Nitti, the Prime Minister, in a letter\r\naddressed to the electorate on the eve of the General Election (Oct.,\r\n1919), thought it necessary to make public the following desperate\r\nanalysis of the situation:--(1) The State expenditure amounts to about\r\nthree times the revenue. (2) All the industrial undertakings of the\r\nState, including the railways, telegraphs, and telephones, are being run\r\nat a loss. Although the public is buying bread at a high price, that\r\nprice represents a loss to the Government of about a milliard a year.\r\n(3) Exports now leaving the country are valued at only one-quarter or\r\none-fifth of the imports from abroad. (4) The National Debt is\r\nincreasing by about a milliard lire per month. (5) The military\r\nexpenditure for one month is still larger than that for the first year\r\nof the war.\r\n\r\nBut if this is the budgetary position of France and Italy, that of the\r\nrest of belligerent Europe is yet more desperate. In Germany the total\r\nexpenditure of the Empire, the Federal States, and the Communes in\r\n1919-20 is estimated at 25 milliards of marks, of which not above 10\r\nmilliards are covered by previously existing taxation. This is without\r\nallowing anything for the payment of the indemnity. In Russia, Poland,\r\nHungary, or Austria such a thing as a budget cannot be seriously\r\nconsidered to exist at all.[154]\r\n\r\nThus the menace of inflationism described above is not merely a product\r\nof the war, of which peace begins the cure. It is a continuing\r\nphenomenon of which the end is not yet in sight.\r\n\r\nAll these influences combine not merely to prevent Europe from\r\nsupplying immediately a sufficient stream of exports to pay for the\r\ngoods she needs to import, but they impair her credit for securing the\r\nworking capital required to re-start the circle of exchange and also, by\r\nswinging the forces of economic law yet further from equilibrium rather\r\nthan towards it, they favor a continuance of the present conditions\r\ninstead of a recovery from them. An inefficient, unemployed,\r\ndisorganized Europe faces us, torn by internal strife and international\r\nhate, fighting, starving, pillaging, and lying. What warrant is there\r\nfor a picture of less somber colors?\r\n\r\nI have paid little heed in this book to Russia, Hungary, or\r\nAustria.[155] There the miseries of life and the disintegration of\r\nsociety are too notorious to require analysis; and these countries are\r\nalready experiencing the actuality of what for the rest of Europe is\r\nstill in the realm of prediction. Yet they comprehend a vast territory\r\nand a great population, and are an extant example of how much man can\r\nsuffer and how far society can decay. Above all, they are the signal to\r\nus of how in the final catastrophe the malady of the body passes over\r\ninto malady of the mind. Economic privation proceeds by easy stages, and\r\nso long as men suffer it patiently the outside world cares little.\r\nPhysical efficiency and resistance to disease slowly diminish,[156] but\r\nlife proceeds somehow, until the limit of human endurance is reached at\r\nlast and counsels of despair and madness stir the sufferers from the\r\nlethargy which precedes the crisis. Then man shakes himself, and the\r\nbonds of custom are loosed. The power of ideas is sovereign, and he\r\nlistens to whatever instruction of hope, illusion, or revenge is carried\r\nto him on the air. As I write, the flames of Russian Bolshevism seem,\r\nfor the moment at least, to have burnt themselves out, and the peoples\r\nof Central and Eastern Europe are held in a dreadful torpor. The lately\r\ngathered harvest keeps off the worst privations, and Peace has been\r\ndeclared at Paris. But winter approaches. Men will have nothing to look\r\nforward to or to nourish hopes on. There will be little fuel to moderate\r\nthe rigors of the season or to comfort the starved bodies of the\r\ntown-dwellers.\r\n\r\nBut who can say how much is endurable, or in what direction men will\r\nseek at last to escape from their misfortunes?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[145] Professor Starling's _Report on Food Conditions in\r\nGermany_. (Cmd. 280.)\r\n\r\n[146] Including the _Darlehenskassenscheine_ somewhat more.\r\n\r\n[147] Similarly in Austria prices ought to be between twenty\r\nand thirty times their former level.\r\n\r\n[148] One of the moat striking and symptomatic difficulties\r\nwhich faced the Allied authorities in their administration of the\r\noccupied areas of Germany during the Armistice arose out of the fact\r\nthat even when they brought food into the country the inhabitants could\r\nnot afford to pay its cost price.\r\n\r\n[149] Theoretically an unduly low level of home prices should\r\nstimulate exports and so cure itself. But in Germany, and still more in\r\nPoland and Austria, there is little or nothing to export. There must be\r\nimports _before_ there can be exports.\r\n\r\n[150] Allowing for the diminished value of gold, the exchange\r\nvalue of the franc should be less than 40 per cent of its previous\r\nvalue, instead of the actual figure of about 60 per cent, if the fall\r\nwere proportional to the increase in the volume of the currency.\r\n\r\n[151] How very far from equilibrium France's international\r\nexchange now is can be seen from the following table:\r\n\r\n                                             Excess of\r\n      Monthly         Imports     Exports     Imports\r\n      Average          $1,000      $1,000      $1,000\r\n\r\n              1913     140,355     114,670      25,685\r\n              1914     106,705      81,145      25,560\r\n              1918     331,915      69,055     262,860\r\n    Jan.-Mar. 1919     387,140      66,670     320,470\r\n    Apr.-June 1919     421,410      83,895     337,515\r\n         July 1919     467,565     123,675     343,890\r\n\r\nThese figures have been converted, at approximately par rates, but this\r\nis roughly compensated by the fact that the trade of 1918 and 1919 has\r\nbeen valued at 1917 official rates. French imports cannot possibly\r\ncontinue at anything approaching these figures, and the semblance of\r\nprosperity based on such a state of affairs is spurious.\r\n\r\n[152] The figures for Italy are as follows:\r\n\r\n                                             Excess of\r\n      Monthly         Imports     Exports     Imports\r\n      Average          $1,000      $1,000      $1,000\r\n\r\n              1913      60,760      41,860      18,900\r\n              1914      48,720      36,840      11,880\r\n              1918     235,025      41,390     193,635\r\n    Jan.-Mar. 1919     229,240      38,685     191,155\r\n    Apr.-June 1919     331,035      69,250     261,785\r\n    July-Aug. 1919     223,535      84,515     139,020\r\n\r\n[153] In the last two returns of the Bank of France available\r\nas I write (Oct. 2 and 9, 1919) the increases in the note issue on the\r\nweek amounted to $93,750,000 and $94,125,000 respectively.\r\n\r\n[154] On October 3, 1919, M. Bilinski made his financial\r\nstatement to the Polish Diet. He estimated his expenditure for the next\r\nnine months at rather more than double his expenditure for the past nine\r\nmonths, and while during the first period his revenue had amounted to\r\none-fifth of his expenditure, for the coming months he was budgeting for\r\nreceipts equal to one-eighth of his outgoings. The _Times_ correspondent\r\nat Warsaw reported that \"in general M. Bilinski's tone was optimistic\r\nand appeared to satisfy his audience.\"\r\n\r\n[155] The terms of the Peace Treaty imposed on the Austrian\r\nRepublic bear no relation to the real facts of that State's desperate\r\nsituation. The _Arbeiter Zeitung_ of Vienna on June 4, 1919, commented\r\non them as follows: \"Never has the substance of a treaty of peace so\r\ngrossly betrayed the intentions which were said to have guided its\r\nconstruction as is the case with this Treaty ... in which every provision\r\nis permeated with ruthlessness and pitilessness, in which no breath of\r\nhuman sympathy can be detected, which flies in the face of everything\r\nwhich binds man to man, which is a crime against humanity itself,\r\nagainst a suffering and tortured people.\" I am acquainted in detail with\r\nthe Austrian Treaty and I was present when some of its terms were being\r\ndrafted, but I do not find it easy to rebut the justice of this\r\noutburst.\r\n\r\n[156] For months past the reports of the health conditions in\r\nthe Central Empires have been of such a character that the imagination\r\nis dulled, and one almost seems guilty of sentimentality in quoting\r\nthem. But their general veracity is not disputed, and I quote the three\r\nfollowing, that the reader may not be unmindful of them: \"In the last\r\nyears of the war, in Austria alone at least 35,000 people died of\r\ntuberculosis, in Vienna alone 12,000. Today we have to reckon with a\r\nnumber of at least 350,000 to 400,000 people who require treatment for\r\ntuberculosis.... As the result of malnutrition a bloodless generation is\r\ngrowing up with undeveloped muscles, undeveloped joints, and undeveloped\r\nbrain\" (_Neue Freie Presse_, May 31, 1919). The Commission of Doctors\r\nappointed by the Medical Faculties of Holland, Sweden, and Norway to\r\nexamine the conditions in Germany reported as follows in the Swedish\r\nPress in April, 1919: \"Tuberculosis, especially in children, is\r\nincreasing in an appalling way, and, generally speaking, is malignant.\r\nIn the same way rickets is more serious and more widely prevalent. It is\r\nimpossible to do anything for these diseases; there is no milk for the\r\ntuberculous, and no cod-liver oil for those suffering from rickets....\r\nTuberculosis is assuming almost unprecedented aspects, such as have\r\nhitherto only been known in exceptional cases. The whole body is\r\nattacked simultaneously, and the illness in this form is practically\r\nincurable.... Tuberculosis is nearly always fatal now among adults. It\r\nis the cause of 90 per cent of the hospital cases. Nothing can be done\r\nagainst it owing to lack of food-stuffs.... It appears in the most\r\nterrible forms, such as glandular tuberculosis, which turns into\r\npurulent dissolution.\" The following is by a writer in the _Vossische\r\nZeitung_, June 5, 1919, who accompanied the Hoover Mission to the\r\nErzgebirge: \"I visited large country districts where 90 per cent of all\r\nthe children were ricketty and where children of three years are only\r\nbeginning to walk.... Accompany me to a school in the Erzgebirge. You\r\nthink it is a kindergarten for the little ones. No, these are children\r\nof seven and eight years. Tiny faces, with large dull eyes, overshadowed\r\nby huge puffed, ricketty foreheads, their small arms just skin and bone,\r\nand above the crooked legs with their dislocated joints the swollen,\r\npointed stomachs of the hunger œdema.... 'You see this child here,' the\r\nphysician in charge explained; 'it consumed an incredible amount of\r\nbread, and yet did not get any stronger. I found out that it hid all the\r\nbread it received underneath its straw mattress. The fear of hunger was\r\nso deeply rooted in the child that it collected stores instead of eating\r\nthe food: a misguided animal instinct made the dread of hunger worse\r\nthan the actual pangs.'\" Yet there are many persons apparently in whose\r\nopinion justice requires that such beings should pay tribute until they\r\nare forty or fifty years of age in relief of the British taxpayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nREMEDIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to maintain true perspective in large affairs. I have\r\ncriticized the work of Paris, and have depicted in somber colors the\r\ncondition and the prospects of Europe. This is one aspect of the\r\nposition and, I believe, a true one. But in so complex a phenomenon the\r\nprognostics do not all point one way; and we may make the error of\r\nexpecting consequences to follow too swiftly and too inevitably from\r\nwhat perhaps are not _all_ the relevant causes. The blackness of the\r\nprospect itself leads us to doubt its accuracy; our imagination is\r\ndulled rather than stimulated by too woeful a narration, and our minds\r\nrebound from what is felt \"too bad to be true.\" But before the reader\r\nallows himself to be too much swayed by these natural reflections, and\r\nbefore I lead him, as is the intention of this chapter, towards remedies\r\nand ameliorations and the discovery of happier tendencies, let him\r\nredress the balance of his thought by recalling two contrasts--England\r\nand Russia, of which the one may encourage his optimism too much, but\r\nthe other should remind him that catastrophes can still happen, and\r\nthat modern society is not immune from the very greatest evils.\r\n\r\nIn the chapters of this book I have not generally had in mind the\r\nsituation or the problems of England. \"Europe\" in my narration must\r\ngenerally be interpreted to exclude the British Isles. England is in a\r\nstate of transition, and her economic problems are serious. We may be on\r\nthe eve of great changes in her social and industrial structure. Some of\r\nus may welcome such prospects and some of us deplore them. But they are\r\nof a different kind altogether from those impending on Europe. I do not\r\nperceive in England the slightest possibility of catastrophe or any\r\nserious likelihood of a general upheaval of society. The war has\r\nimpoverished us, but not seriously;--I should judge that the real wealth\r\nof the country in 1919 is at least equal to what it was in 1900. Our\r\nbalance of trade is adverse, but not so much so that the readjustment of\r\nit need disorder our economic life.[157] The deficit in our Budget is\r\nlarge, but not beyond what firm and prudent statesmanship could bridge.\r\nThe shortening of the hours of labor may have somewhat diminished our\r\nproductivity. But it should not be too much to hope that this is a\r\nfeature of transition, and no one who is acquainted with the British\r\nworkingman can doubt that, if it suits him, and if he is in sympathy and\r\nreasonable contentment with the conditions of his life, he can produce\r\nat least as much in a shorter working day as he did in the longer hours\r\nwhich prevailed formerly. The most serious problems for England have\r\nbeen brought to a head by the war, but are in their origins more\r\nfundamental. The forces of the nineteenth century have run their course\r\nand are exhausted. The economic motives and ideals of that generation no\r\nlonger satisfy us: we must find a new way and must suffer again the\r\n_malaise_, and finally the pangs, of a new industrial birth. This is one\r\nelement. The other is that on which I have enlarged in Chapter II.;--the\r\nincrease in the real cost of food and the diminishing response of nature\r\nto any further increase in the population of the world, a tendency which\r\nmust be especially injurious to the greatest of all industrial\r\ncountries and the most dependent on imported supplies of food.\r\n\r\nBut these secular problems are such as no age is free from. They are of\r\nan altogether different order from those which may afflict the peoples\r\nof Central Europe. Those readers who, chiefly mindful of the British\r\nconditions with which they are familiar, are apt to indulge their\r\noptimism, and still more those whose immediate environment is American,\r\nmust cast their minds to Russia, Turkey, Hungary, or Austria, where the\r\nmost dreadful material evils which men can suffer--famine, cold,\r\ndisease, war, murder, and anarchy--are an actual present experience, if\r\nthey are to apprehend the character of the misfortunes against the\r\nfurther extension of which it must surely be our duty to seek the\r\nremedy, if there is one.\r\n\r\nWhat then is to be done? The tentative suggestions of this chapter may\r\nappear to the reader inadequate. But the opportunity was missed at Paris\r\nduring the six months which followed the Armistice, and nothing we can\r\ndo now can repair the mischief wrought at that time. Great privation and\r\ngreat risks to society have become unavoidable. All that is now open to\r\nus is to redirect, so far as lies in our power, the fundamental economic\r\ntendencies which underlie the events of the hour, so that they promote\r\nthe re-establishment of prosperity and order, instead of leading us\r\ndeeper into misfortune.\r\n\r\nWe must first escape from the atmosphere and the methods of Paris. Those\r\nwho controlled the Conference may bow before the gusts of popular\r\nopinion, but they will never lead us out of our troubles. It is hardly\r\nto be supposed that the Council of Four can retrace their steps, even if\r\nthey wished to do so. The replacement of the existing Governments of\r\nEurope is, therefore, an almost indispensable preliminary.\r\n\r\nI propose then to discuss a program, for those who believe that the\r\nPeace of Versailles cannot stand, under the following heads:\r\n\r\n1. The Revision of the Treaty.\r\n\r\n2. The settlement of inter-Ally indebtedness.\r\n\r\n3. An international loan and the reform of the currency.\r\n\r\n4. The relations of Central Europe to Russia.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _The Revision of the Treaty_\r\n\r\nAre any constitutional means open to us for altering the Treaty?\r\nPresident Wilson and General Smuts, who believe that to have secured the\r\nCovenant of the League of Nations outweighs much evil in the rest of the\r\nTreaty, have indicated that we must look to the League for the gradual\r\nevolution of a more tolerable life for Europe. \"There are territorial\r\nsettlements,\" General Smuts wrote in his statement on signing the Peace\r\nTreaty, \"which will need revision. There are guarantees laid down which\r\nwe all hope will soon be found out of harmony with the new peaceful\r\ntemper and unarmed state of our former enemies. There are punishments\r\nforeshadowed over most of which a calmer mood may yet prefer to pass the\r\nsponge of oblivion. There are indemnities stipulated which cannot be\r\nenacted without grave injury to the industrial revival of Europe, and\r\nwhich it will be in the interests of all to render more tolerable and\r\nmoderate.... I am confident that the League of Nations will yet prove\r\nthe path of escape for Europe out of the ruin brought about by this\r\nwar.\" Without the League, President Wilson informed the Senate when he\r\npresented the Treaty to them early in July, 1919, \"...long-continued\r\nsupervision of the task of reparation which Germany was to undertake to\r\ncomplete within the next generation might entirely break down;[158] the\r\nreconsideration and revision of administrative arrangements and\r\nrestrictions which the Treaty prescribed, but which it recognized might\r\nnot provide lasting advantage or be entirely fair if too long enforced,\r\nwould be impracticable.\"\r\n\r\nCan we look forward with fair hopes to securing from the operation of\r\nthe League those benefits which two of its principal begetters thus\r\nencourage us to expect from it? The relevant passage is to be found in\r\nArticle XIX. of the Covenant, which runs as follows:\r\n\r\n    \"The Assembly may from time to time advise the\r\n    reconsideration by Members of the League of treaties which\r\n    have become inapplicable and the consideration of\r\n    international conditions whose continuance might endanger the\r\n    peace of the world.\"\r\n\r\nBut alas! Article V. provides that \"Except where otherwise expressly\r\nprovided in this Covenant or by the terms of the present Treaty,\r\ndecisions at any meeting of the Assembly or of the Council shall require\r\nthe agreement of all the Members of the League represented at the\r\nmeeting.\" Does not this provision reduce the League, so far as concerns\r\nan early reconsideration of any of the terms of the Peace Treaty, into a\r\nbody merely for wasting time? If all the parties to the Treaty are\r\nunanimously of opinion that it requires alteration in a particular\r\nsense, it does not need a League and a Covenant to put the business\r\nthrough. Even when the Assembly of the League is unanimous it can only\r\n\"advise\" reconsideration by the members specially affected.\r\n\r\nBut the League will operate, say its supporters, by its influence on the\r\npublic opinion of the world, and the view of the majority will carry\r\ndecisive weight in practice, even though constitutionally it is of no\r\neffect. Let us pray that this be so. Yet the League in the hands of the\r\ntrained European diplomatist may become an unequaled instrument for\r\nobstruction and delay. The revision of Treaties is entrusted primarily,\r\nnot to the Council, which meets frequently, but to the Assembly, which\r\nwill meet more rarely and must become, as any one with an experience of\r\nlarge Inter-Ally Conferences must know, an unwieldy polyglot debating\r\nsociety in which the greatest resolution and the best management may\r\nfail altogether to bring issues to a head against an opposition in favor\r\nof the _status quo_. There are indeed two disastrous blots on the\r\nCovenant,--Article V., which prescribes unanimity, and the\r\nmuch-criticized Article X., by which \"The Members of the League\r\nundertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the\r\nterritorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members\r\nof the League.\" These two Articles together go some way to destroy the\r\nconception of the League as an instrument of progress, and to equip it\r\nfrom the outset with an almost fatal bias towards the _status quo_. It\r\nis these Articles which have reconciled to the League some of its\r\noriginal opponents, who now hope to make of it another Holy Alliance for\r\nthe perpetuation of the economic ruin of their enemies and the Balance\r\nof Power in their own interests which they believe themselves to have\r\nestablished by the Peace.\r\n\r\nBut while it would be wrong and foolish to conceal from ourselves in the\r\ninterests of \"idealism\" the real difficulties of the position in the\r\nspecial matter of revising treaties, that is no reason for any of us to\r\ndecry the League, which the wisdom of the world may yet transform into a\r\npowerful instrument of peace, and which in Articles XI.-XVII.[159] has\r\nalready accomplished a great and beneficent achievement. I agree,\r\ntherefore, that our first efforts for the Revision of the Treaty must be\r\nmade through the League rather than in any other way, in the hope that\r\nthe force of general opinion and, if necessary, the use of financial\r\npressure and financial inducements, may be enough to prevent a\r\nrecalcitrant minority from exercising their right of veto. We must trust\r\nthe new Governments, whose existence I premise in the principal Allied\r\ncountries, to show a profounder wisdom and a greater magnanimity than\r\ntheir predecessors.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in Chapters IV. and V. that there are numerous particulars\r\nin which the Treaty is objectionable. I do not intend to enter here into\r\ndetails, or to attempt a revision of the Treaty clause by clause. I\r\nlimit myself to three great changes which are necessary for the economic\r\nlife of Europe, relating to Reparation, to Coal and Iron, and to\r\nTariffs.\r\n\r\n_Reparation_.--If the sum demanded for Reparation is less than what the\r\nAllies are entitled to on a strict interpretation of their engagements,\r\nit is unnecessary to particularize the items it represents or to hear\r\narguments about its compilation. I suggest, therefore, the following\r\nsettlement:--\r\n\r\n(1) The amount of the payment to be made by Germany in respect of\r\nReparation and the costs of the Armies of Occupation might be fixed at\r\n$10,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n(2) The surrender of merchant ships and submarine cables under the\r\nTreaty, of war material under the Armistice, of State property in ceded\r\nterritory, of claims against such territory in respect of public debt,\r\nand of Germany's claims against her former Allies, should be reckoned as\r\nworth the lump sum of $2,500,000,000, without any attempt being made to\r\nevaluate them item by item.\r\n\r\n(3) The balance of $7,500,000,000 should not carry interest pending its\r\nrepayment, and should be paid by Germany in thirty annual instalments of\r\n$250,000,000, beginning in 1923.\r\n\r\n(4) The Reparation Commission should be dissolved, or, if any duties\r\nremain for it to perform, it should become an appanage of the League of\r\nNations and should include representatives of Germany and of the neutral\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n(5) Germany would be left to meet the annual instalments in such manner\r\nas she might see fit, any complaint against her for non-fulfilment of\r\nher obligations being lodged with the League of Nations. That is to say,\r\nthere would be no further expropriation of German private property\r\nabroad, except so far as is required to meet private German obligations\r\nout of the proceeds of such property already liquidated or in the hands\r\nof Public Trustees and Enemy Property Custodians in the Allied countries\r\nand in the United States; and, in particular, Article 260 (which\r\nprovides for the expropriation of German interests in public utility\r\nenterprises) would be abrogated.\r\n\r\n(6) No attempt should be made to extract Reparation payments from\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\n_Coal and Iron_.--(1) The Allies' options on coal under Annex V. should\r\nbe abandoned, but Germany's obligation to make good France's loss of\r\ncoal through the destruction of her mines should remain. That is to say,\r\nGermany should undertake \"to deliver to France annually for a period not\r\nexceeding ten years an amount of coal equal to the difference between\r\nthe annual production before the war of the coal mines of the Nord and\r\nPas de Calais, destroyed as a result of the war, and the production of\r\nthe mines of the same area during the years in question; such delivery\r\nnot to exceed twenty million tons in any one year of the first five\r\nyears, and eight million tons in any one year of the succeeding five\r\nyears.\" This obligation should lapse, nevertheless, in the event of the\r\ncoal districts of Upper Silesia being taken from Germany in the final\r\nsettlement consequent on the plebiscite.\r\n\r\n(2) The arrangement as to the Saar should hold good, except that, on the\r\none hand, Germany should receive no credit for the mines, and, on the\r\nother, should receive back both the mines and the territory without\r\npayment and unconditionally after ten years. But this should be\r\nconditional on France's entering into an agreement for the same period\r\nto supply Germany from Lorraine with at least 50 per cent of the\r\niron-ore which was carried from Lorraine into Germany proper before the\r\nwar, in return for an undertaking from Germany to supply Lorraine with\r\nan amount of coal equal to the whole amount formerly sent to Lorraine\r\nfrom Germany proper, after allowing for the output of the Saar.\r\n\r\n(3) The arrangement as to Upper Silesia should hold good. That is to\r\nsay, a plebiscite should be held, and in coming to a final decision\r\n\"regard will be paid (by the principal Allied and Associated Powers) to\r\nthe wishes of the inhabitants as shown by the vote, and to the\r\ngeographical and economic conditions of the locality.\" But the Allies\r\nshould declare that in their judgment \"economic conditions\" require the\r\ninclusion of the coal districts in Germany unless the wishes of the\r\ninhabitants are decidedly to the contrary.\r\n\r\n(4) The Coal Commission already established by the Allies should become\r\nan appanage of the League of Nations, and should be enlarged to include\r\nrepresentatives of Germany and the other States of Central and Eastern\r\nEurope, of the Northern Neutrals, and of Switzerland. Its authority\r\nshould be advisory only, but should extend over the distribution of the\r\ncoal supplies of Germany, Poland, and the constituent parts of the\r\nformer Austro-Hungarian Empire, and of the exportable surplus of the\r\nUnited Kingdom. All the States represented on the Commission should\r\nundertake to furnish it with the fullest information, and to be guided\r\nby its advice so far as their sovereignty and their vital interests\r\npermit.\r\n\r\n_Tariffs_.--A Free Trade Union should be established under the auspices\r\nof the League of Nations of countries undertaking to impose no\r\nprotectionist tariffs[160] whatever against the produce of other members\r\nof the Union, Germany, Poland, the new States which formerly composed\r\nthe Austro-Hungarian and Turkish Empires, and the Mandated States should\r\nbe compelled to adhere to this Union for ten years, after which time\r\nadherence would be voluntary. The adherence of other States would be\r\nvoluntary from the outset. But it is to be hoped that the United\r\nKingdom, at any rate, would become an original member.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBy fixing the Reparation payments well within Germany's capacity to pay,\r\nwe make possible the renewal of hope and enterprise within her\r\nterritory, we avoid the perpetual friction and opportunity of improper\r\npressure arising out of Treaty clauses which are impossible of\r\nfulfilment, and we render unnecessary the intolerable powers of the\r\nReparation Commission.\r\n\r\nBy a moderation of the clauses relating directly or indirectly to coal,\r\nand by the exchange of iron-ore, we permit the continuance of Germany's\r\nindustrial life, and put limits on the loss of productivity which would\r\nbe brought about otherwise by the interference of political frontiers\r\nwith the natural localization of the iron and steel industry.\r\n\r\nBy the proposed Free Trade Union some part of the loss of organization\r\nand economic efficiency may be retrieved, which must otherwise result\r\nfrom the innumerable new political frontiers now created between greedy,\r\njealous, immature, and economically incomplete nationalist States.\r\nEconomic frontiers were tolerable so long as an immense territory was\r\nincluded in a few great Empires; but they will not be tolerable when the\r\nEmpires of Germany, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Turkey have been\r\npartitioned between some twenty independent authorities. A Free Trade\r\nUnion, comprising the whole of Central, Eastern, and South-Eastern\r\nEurope, Siberia, Turkey, and (I should hope) the United Kingdom, Egypt,\r\nand India, might do as much for the peace and prosperity of the world as\r\nthe League of Nations itself. Belgium, Holland, Scandinavia, and\r\nSwitzerland might be expected to adhere to it shortly. And it would be\r\ngreatly to be desired by their friends that France and Italy also should\r\nsee their way to adhesion.\r\n\r\nIt would be objected, I suppose, by some critics that such an\r\narrangement might go some way in effect towards realizing the former\r\nGerman dream of Mittel-Europa. If other countries were so foolish as to\r\nremain outside the Union and to leave to Germany all its advantages,\r\nthere might be some truth in this. But an economic system, to which\r\nevery one had the opportunity of belonging and which gave special\r\nprivilege to none, is surely absolutely free from the objections of a\r\nprivileged and avowedly imperialistic scheme of exclusion and\r\ndiscrimination. Our attitude to these criticisms must be determined by\r\nour whole moral and emotional reaction to the future of international\r\nrelations and the Peace of the World. If we take the view that for at\r\nleast a generation to come Germany cannot be trusted with even a modicum\r\nof prosperity, that while all our recent Allies are angels of light, all\r\nour recent enemies, Germans, Austrians, Hungarians, and the rest, are\r\nchildren of the devil, that year by year Germany must be kept\r\nimpoverished and her children starved and crippled, and that she must be\r\nringed round by enemies; then we shall reject all the proposals of this\r\nchapter, and particularly those which may assist Germany to regain a\r\npart of her former material prosperity and find a means of livelihood\r\nfor the industrial population of her towns. But if this view of nations\r\nand of their relation to one another is adopted by the democracies of\r\nWestern Europe, and is financed by the United States, heaven help us\r\nall. If we aim deliberately at the impoverishment of Central Europe,\r\nvengeance, I dare predict, will not limp. Nothing can then delay for\r\nvery long that final civil war between the forces of Reaction and the\r\ndespairing convulsions of Revolution, before which the horrors of the\r\nlate German war will fade into nothing, and which will destroy, whoever\r\nis victor, the civilization and the progress of our generation. Even\r\nthough the result disappoint us, must we not base our actions on better\r\nexpectations, and believe that the prosperity and happiness of one\r\ncountry promotes that of others, that the solidarity of man is not a\r\nfiction, and that nations can still afford to treat other nations as\r\nfellow-creatures?\r\n\r\nSuch changes as I have proposed above might do something appreciable to\r\nenable the industrial populations of Europe to continue to earn a\r\nlivelihood. But they would not be enough by themselves. In particular,\r\nFrance would be a loser on paper (on paper only, for she will never\r\nsecure the actual fulfilment of her present claims), and an escape from\r\nher embarrassments must be shown her in some other direction. I proceed,\r\ntherefore, to proposals, first, for the adjustment of the claims of\r\nAmerica and the Allies amongst themselves; and second, for the provision\r\nof sufficient credit to enable Europe to re-create her stock of\r\ncirculating capital.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _The Settlement of Inter-Ally Indebtedness_\r\n\r\nIn proposing a modification of the Reparation terms, I have considered\r\nthem so far only in relation to Germany. But fairness requires that so\r\ngreat a reduction in the amount should be accompanied by a readjustment\r\nof its apportionment between the Allies themselves. The professions\r\nwhich our statesmen made on every platform during the war, as well as\r\nother considerations, surely require that the areas damaged by the\r\nenemy's invasion should receive a priority of compensation. While this\r\nwas one of the ultimate objects for which we said we were fighting, we\r\nnever included the recovery of separation allowances amongst our war\r\naims. I suggest, therefore, that we should by our acts prove ourselves\r\nsincere and trustworthy, and that accordingly Great Britain should waive\r\naltogether her claims for cash payment in favor of Belgium, Serbia, and\r\nFrance. The whole of the payments made by Germany would then be subject\r\nto the prior charge of repairing the material injury done to those\r\ncountries and provinces which suffered actual invasion by the enemy; and\r\nI believe that the sum of $7,500,000,000 thus available would be\r\nadequate to cover entirely the actual costs of restoration. Further, it\r\nis only by a complete subordination of her own claims for cash\r\ncompensation that Great Britain can ask with clean hands for a revision\r\nof the Treaty and clear her honor from the breach of faith for which she\r\nbears the main responsibility, as a result of the policy to which the\r\nGeneral Election of 1918 pledged her representatives.\r\n\r\nWith the Reparation problem thus cleared up it would be possible to\r\nbring forward with a better grace and more hope of success two other\r\nfinancial proposals, each of which involves an appeal to the generosity\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nThe first is for the entire cancellation of Inter-Ally indebtedness\r\n(that is to say, indebtedness between the Governments of the Allied and\r\nAssociated countries) incurred for the purposes of the war. This\r\nproposal, which has been put forward already in certain quarters, is one\r\nwhich I believe to be absolutely essential to the future prosperity of\r\nthe world. It would be an act of far-seeing statesmanship for the United\r\nKingdom and the United States, the two Powers chiefly concerned, to\r\nadopt it. The sums of money which are involved are shown approximately\r\nin the following table:--[161]\r\n\r\n    -----------------+------------+------------+-----------+----------\r\n    Loans to         | By United  | By United  | By France | Total\r\n                     |   States   |  Kingdom   |           |\r\n    -----------------+------------+------------+-----------+----------\r\n                     | Million    | Million    | Million   | Million\r\n                     | Dollars    | Dollars    | Dollars   | Dollars\r\n                     |            |            |           |\r\n    United Kingdom   |  4,210     |      0     |      0    |  4,210\r\n    France           |  2,750     |  2,540     |      0    |  5,200\r\n    Italy            |  1,625     |  2,335     |    175    |  4,135\r\n    Russia           |    190     |  2,840[162]|    800    |  3,830\r\n    Belgium          |    400     |    490[163]|    450    |  1,340\r\n    Serbia and       |            |            |           |\r\n      Jugo-Slavia    |    100     |    100[163]|    100    |    300\r\n    Other Allies     |    175     |    395     |    250    |    820\r\n                     |  -----     |  -----     |  -----    | ------\r\n    Total            |  9,450[164]|  8,700     |  1,775    | 19,925\r\n                     |            |            |           |\r\n    -----------------+------------+------------+-----------+----------\r\n\r\nThus the total volume of Inter-Ally indebtedness, assuming that loans\r\nfrom one Ally are not set off against loans to another, is nearly\r\n$20,000,000,000. The United States is a lender only. The United Kingdom\r\nhas lent about twice as much as she has borrowed. France has borrowed\r\nabout three times as much as she has lent. The other Allies have been\r\nborrowers only.\r\n\r\nIf all the above Inter-Ally indebtedness were mutually forgiven, the\r\nnet result on paper (_i.e._ assuming all the loans to be good) would be\r\na surrender by the United States of about $10,000,000,000 and by the\r\nUnited Kingdom of about $4,500,000,000. France would gain about\r\n$3,500,000,000 and Italy about $4,000,000,000. But these figures\r\noverstate the loss to the United Kingdom and understate the gain to\r\nFrance; for a large part of the loans made by both these countries has\r\nbeen to Russia and cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be considered\r\ngood. If the loans which the United Kingdom has made to her Allies are\r\nreckoned to be worth 50 per cent of their full value (an arbitrary but\r\nconvenient assumption which the Chancellor of the Exchequer has adopted\r\non more than one occasion as being as good as any other for the purposes\r\nof an approximate national balance sheet), the operation would involve\r\nher neither in loss nor in gain. But in whatever way the net result is\r\ncalculated on paper, the relief in anxiety which such a liquidation of\r\nthe position would carry with it would be very great. It is from the\r\nUnited States, therefore, that the proposal asks generosity.\r\n\r\nSpeaking with a very intimate knowledge of the relations throughout the\r\nwar between the British, the American, and the other Allied Treasuries,\r\nI believe this to be an act of generosity for which Europe can fairly\r\nask, provided Europe is making an honorable attempt in other\r\ndirections, not to continue war, economic or otherwise, but to achieve\r\nthe economic reconstitution of the whole Continent, The financial\r\nsacrifices of the United States have been, in proportion to her wealth,\r\nimmensely less than those of the European States. This could hardly have\r\nbeen otherwise. It was a European quarrel, in which the United States\r\nGovernment could not have justified itself before its citizens in\r\nexpending the whole national strength, as did the Europeans. After the\r\nUnited States came into the war her financial assistance was lavish and\r\nunstinted, and without this assistance the Allies could never have won\r\nthe war,[165] quite apart from the decisive influence of the arrival of\r\nthe American troops. Europe, too, should never forget the extraordinary\r\nassistance afforded her during the first six months of 1919 through the\r\nagency of Mr. Hoover and the American Commission of Relief. Never was a\r\nnobler work of disinterested goodwill carried through with more tenacity\r\nand sincerity and skill, and with less thanks either asked or given.\r\nThe ungrateful Governments of Europe owe much more to the statesmanship\r\nand insight of Mr. Hoover and his band of American workers than they\r\nhave yet appreciated or will ever acknowledge. The American Relief\r\nCommission, and they only, saw the European position during those months\r\nin its true perspective and felt towards it as men should. It was their\r\nefforts, their energy, and the American resources placed by the\r\nPresident at their disposal, often acting in the teeth of European\r\nobstruction, which not only saved an immense amount of human suffering,\r\nbut averted a widespread breakdown of the European system.[166]\r\n\r\nBut in speaking thus as we do of American financial assistance, we\r\ntacitly assume, and America, I believe, assumed it too when she gave the\r\nmoney, that it was not in the nature of an investment. If Europe is\r\ngoing to repay the $10,000,000,000 worth of financial assistance which\r\nshe has had from the United States with compound interest at 5 per cent,\r\nthe matter takes on quite a different complexion. If America's advances\r\nare to be regarded in this light, her relative financial sacrifice has\r\nbeen very slight indeed.\r\n\r\nControversies as to relative sacrifice are very barren and very foolish\r\nalso; for there is no reason in the world why relative sacrifice should\r\nnecessarily be equal,--so many other very relevant considerations being\r\nquite different in the two cases. The two or three facts following are\r\nput forward, therefore, not to suggest that they provide any compelling\r\nargument for Americans, but only to show that from his own selfish point\r\nof view an Englishman is not seeking to avoid due sacrifice on his\r\ncountry's part in making the present suggestion. (1) The sums which the\r\nBritish Treasury borrowed from the American Treasury, after the latter\r\ncame into the war, were approximately offset by the sums which England\r\nlent to her other Allies _during the same period_ (i.e. excluding sums\r\nlent before the United States came into the war); so that almost the\r\nwhole of England's indebtedness to the United States was incurred, not\r\non her own account, but to enable her to assist the rest of her Allies,\r\nwho were for various reasons not in a position to draw their assistance\r\nfrom the United States direct.[167] (2) The United Kingdom has disposed\r\nof about $5,000,000,000 worth of her foreign securities, and in addition\r\nhas incurred foreign debt to the amount of about $6,000,000,000. The\r\nUnited States, so far from selling, has bought back upwards of\r\n$5,000,000,000, and has incurred practically no foreign debt. (3) The\r\npopulation of the United Kingdom is about one-half that of the United\r\nStates, the income about one-third, and the accumulated wealth between\r\none-half and one-third. The financial capacity of the United Kingdom may\r\ntherefore be put at about two-fifths that of the United States. This\r\nfigure enables us to make the following comparison:--Excluding loans to\r\nAllies in each case (as is right on the assumption that these loans are\r\nto be repaid), the war expenditure of the United Kingdom has been about\r\nthree times that of the United Sates, or in proportion to capacity\r\nbetween seven and eight times.\r\n\r\nHaving cleared this issue out of the way as briefly as possible, I turn\r\nto the broader issues of the future relations between the parties to the\r\nlate war, by which the present proposal must primarily be judged.\r\n\r\nFailing such a settlement as is now proposed, the war will have ended\r\nwith a network of heavy tribute payable from one Ally to another. The\r\ntotal amount of this tribute is even likely to exceed the amount\r\nobtainable from the enemy; and the war will have ended with the\r\nintolerable result of the Allies paying indemnities to one another\r\ninstead of receiving them from the enemy.\r\n\r\nFor this reason the question of Inter-Allied indebtedness is closely\r\nbound up with the intense popular feeling amongst the European Allies on\r\nthe question of indemnities,--a feeling which is based, not on any\r\nreasonable calculation of what Germany can, in fact, pay, but on a\r\nwell-founded appreciation of the unbearable financial situation in which\r\nthese countries will find themselves unless she pays. Take Italy as an\r\nextreme example. If Italy can reasonably be expected to pay\r\n$4,000,000,000, surely Germany can and ought to pay an immeasurably\r\nhigher figure. Or if it is decided (as it must be) that Austria can pay\r\nnext to nothing, is it not an intolerable conclusion that Italy should\r\nbe loaded with a crushing tribute, while Austria escapes? Or, to put it\r\nslightly differently, how can Italy be expected to submit to payment of\r\nthis great sum and see Czecho-Slovakia pay little or nothing? At the\r\nother end of the scale there is the United Kingdom. Here the financial\r\nposition is different, since to ask us to pay $4,000,000,000 is a very\r\ndifferent proposition from asking Italy to pay it. But the sentiment is\r\nmuch the same. If we have to be satisfied without full compensation from\r\nGermany, how bitter will be the protests against paying it to the\r\nUnited States. We, it will be said, have to be content with a claim\r\nagainst the bankrupt estates of Germany, France, Italy, and Russia,\r\nwhereas the United States has secured a first mortgage upon us. The case\r\nof France is at least as overwhelming. She can barely secure from\r\nGermany the full measure of the destruction of her countryside. Yet\r\nvictorious France must pay her friends and Allies more than four times\r\nthe indemnity which in the defeat of 1870 she paid Germany. The hand of\r\nBismarck was light compared with that of an Ally or of an Associate. A\r\nsettlement of Inter-Ally indebtedness is, therefore, an indispensable\r\npreliminary to the peoples of the Allied countries facing, with other\r\nthan a maddened and exasperated heart, the inevitable truth about the\r\nprospects of an indemnity from the enemy.\r\n\r\nIt might be an exaggeration to say that it is impossible for the\r\nEuropean Allies to pay the capital and interest due from them on these\r\ndebts, but to make them do so would certainly be to impose a crushing\r\nburden. They may be expected, therefore, to make constant attempts to\r\nevade or escape payment, and these attempts will be a constant source of\r\ninternational friction and ill-will for many years to come. A debtor\r\nnation does not love its creditor, and it is fruitless to expect\r\nfeelings of goodwill from France, Italy, and Russia towards this\r\ncountry or towards America, if their future development is stifled for\r\nmany years to come by the annual tribute which they must pay us. There\r\nwill be a great incentive to them to seek their friends in other\r\ndirections, and any future rupture of peaceable relations will always\r\ncarry with it the enormous advantage of escaping the payment of external\r\ndebts, if, on the other hand, these great debts are forgiven, a stimulus\r\nwill be given to the solidarity and true friendliness of the nations\r\nlately associated.\r\n\r\nThe existence of the great war debts is a menace to financial stability\r\neverywhere. There is no European country in which repudiation may not\r\nsoon become an important political issue. In the case of internal debt,\r\nhowever, there are interested parties on both sides, and the question is\r\none of the internal distribution of wealth. With external debts this is\r\nnot so, and the creditor nations may soon find their interest\r\ninconveniently bound up with the maintenance of a particular type of\r\ngovernment or economic organization in the debtor countries. Entangling\r\nalliances or entangling leagues are nothing to the entanglements of cash\r\nowing.\r\n\r\nThe final consideration influencing the reader's attitude to this\r\nproposal must, however, depend on his view as to the future place in the\r\nworld's progress of the vast paper entanglements which are our legacy\r\nfrom war finance both at home and abroad. The war has ended with every\r\none owing every one else immense sums of money. Germany owes a large sum\r\nto the Allies, the Allies owe a large sum to Great Britain, and Great\r\nBritain owes a large sum to the United States. The holders of war loan\r\nin every country are owed a large sum by the State, and the State in its\r\nturn is owed a large sum by these and other taxpayers. The whole\r\nposition is in the highest degree artificial, misleading, and vexatious.\r\nWe shall never be able to move again, unless we can free our limbs from\r\nthese paper shackles. A general bonfire is so great a necessity that\r\nunless we can make of it an orderly and good-tempered affair in which no\r\nserious injustice is done to any one, it will, when it comes at last,\r\ngrow into a conflagration that may destroy much else as well. As regards\r\ninternal debt, I am one of those who believe that a capital levy for the\r\nextinction of debt is an absolute prerequisite of sound finance in\r\neveryone of the European belligerent countries. But the continuance on a\r\nhuge scale of indebtedness between Governments has special dangers of\r\nits own.\r\n\r\nBefore the middle of the nineteenth century no nation owed payments to a\r\nforeign nation on any considerable scale, except such tributes as were\r\nexacted under the compulsion of actual occupation in force and, at one\r\ntime, by absentee princes under the sanctions of feudalism. It is true\r\nthat the need for European capitalism to find an outlet in the New World\r\nhas led during the past fifty years, though even now on a relatively\r\nmodest scale, to such countries as Argentine owing an annual sum to such\r\ncountries as England. But the system is fragile; and it has only\r\nsurvived because its burden on the paying countries has not so far been\r\noppressive, because this burden is represented by real assets and is\r\nbound up with the property system generally, and because the sums\r\nalready lent are not unduly large in relation to those which it is still\r\nhoped to borrow. Bankers are used to this system, and believe it to be a\r\nnecessary part of the permanent order of society. They are disposed to\r\nbelieve, therefore, by analogy with it, that a comparable system between\r\nGovernments, on a far vaster and definitely oppressive scale,\r\nrepresented by no real assets, and less closely associated with the\r\nproperty system, is natural and reasonable and in conformity with human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nI doubt this view of the world. Even capitalism at home, which engages\r\nmany local sympathies, which plays a real part in the daily process of\r\nproduction, and upon the security of which the present organization of\r\nsociety largely depends, is not very safe. But however this may be, will\r\nthe discontented peoples of Europe be willing for a generation to come\r\nso to order their lives that an appreciable part of their daily produce\r\nmay be available to meet a foreign payment, the reason of which, whether\r\nas between Europe and America, or as between Germany and the rest of\r\nEurope, does not spring compellingly from their sense of justice or\r\nduty?\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, Europe must depend in the long run on her own daily\r\nlabor and not on the largesse of America; but, on the other hand, she\r\nwill not pinch herself in order that the fruit of her daily labor may go\r\nelsewhere. In short, I do not believe that any of these tributes will\r\ncontinue to be paid, at the best, for more than a very few years. They\r\ndo not square with human nature or agree with the spirit of the age.\r\n\r\nIf there is any force in this mode of thought, expediency and generosity\r\nagree together, and the policy which will best promote immediate\r\nfriendship between nations will not conflict with the permanent\r\ninterests of the benefactor.[168]\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _An International Loan_\r\n\r\nI pass to a second financial proposal. The requirements of Europe are\r\n_immediate_. The prospect of being relieved of oppressive interest\r\npayments to England and America over the whole life of the next two\r\ngenerations (and of receiving from Germany some assistance year by year\r\nto the costs of restoration) would free the future from excessive\r\nanxiety. But it would not meet the ills of the immediate present,--the\r\nexcess of Europe's imports over her exports, the adverse exchange, and\r\nthe disorder of the currency. It will be very difficult for European\r\nproduction to get started again without a temporary measure of external\r\nassistance. I am therefore a supporter of an international loan in some\r\nshape or form, such as has been advocated in many quarters in France,\r\nGermany, and England, and also in the United States. In whatever way the\r\nultimate responsibility for repayment is distributed, the burden of\r\nfinding the immediate resources must inevitably fall in major part upon\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe chief objections to all the varieties of this species of project\r\nare, I suppose, the following. The United States is disinclined to\r\nentangle herself further (after recent experiences) in the affairs of\r\nEurope, and, anyhow, has for the time being no more capital to spare for\r\nexport on a large scale. There is no guarantee that Europe will put\r\nfinancial assistance to proper use, or that she will not squander it and\r\nbe in just as bad case two or three years hence as she is in now;--M.\r\nKlotz will use the money to put off the day of taxation a little longer,\r\nItaly and Jugo-Slavia will fight one another on the proceeds, Poland\r\nwill devote it to fulfilling towards all her neighbors the military rÙle\r\nwhich France has designed for her, the governing classes of Roumania\r\nwill divide up the booty amongst themselves. In short, America would\r\nhave postponed her own capital developments and raised her own cost of\r\nliving in order that Europe might continue for another year or two the\r\npractices, the policy, and the men of the past nine months. And as for\r\nassistance to Germany, is it reasonable or at all tolerable that the\r\nEuropean Allies, having stripped Germany of her last vestige of working\r\ncapital, in opposition to the arguments and appeals of the American\r\nfinancial representatives at Paris, should then turn to the United\r\nStates for funds to rehabilitate the victim in sufficient measure to\r\nallow the spoliation to recommence in a year or two?\r\n\r\nThere is no answer to these objections as matters are now. If I had\r\ninfluence at the United States Treasury, I would not lend a penny to a\r\nsingle one of the present Governments of Europe. They are not to be\r\ntrusted with resources which they would devote to the furtherance of\r\npolicies in repugnance to which, in spite of the President's failure to\r\nassert either the might or the ideals of the people of the United\r\nStates, the Republican and the Democratic parties are probably united.\r\nBut if, as we must pray they will, the souls of the European peoples\r\nturn away this winter from the false idols which have survived the war\r\nthat created them, and substitute in their hearts for the hatred and the\r\nnationalism, which now possess them, thoughts and hopes of the happiness\r\nand solidarity of the European family,--then should natural piety and\r\nfilial love impel the American people to put on one side all the smaller\r\nobjections of private advantage and to complete the work, that they\r\nbegan in saving Europe from the tyranny of organized force, by saving\r\nher from herself. And even if the conversion is not fully accomplished,\r\nand some parties only in each of the European countries have espoused a\r\npolicy of reconciliation, America can still point the way and hold up\r\nthe hands of the party of peace by having a plan and a condition on\r\nwhich she will give her aid to the work of renewing life.\r\n\r\nThe impulse which, we are told, is now strong in the mind of the United\r\nStates to be quit of the turmoil, the complication, the violence, the\r\nexpense, and, above all, the unintelligibility of the European problems,\r\nis easily understood. No one can feel more intensely than the writer\r\nhow natural it is to retort to the folly and impracticability of the\r\nEuropean statesmen,--Rot, then, in your own malice, and we will go our\r\nway--\r\n\r\n\r\n    Remote from Europe; from her blasted hopes;\r\n    Her fields of carnage, and polluted air.\r\n\r\nBut if America recalls for a moment what Europe has meant to her and\r\nstill means to her, what Europe, the mother of art and of knowledge, in\r\nspite of everything, still is and still will be, will she not reject\r\nthese counsels of indifference and isolation, and interest herself in\r\nwhat may prove decisive issues for the progress and civilization of all\r\nmankind?\r\n\r\nAssuming then, if only to keep our hopes up, that America will be\r\nprepared to contribute to the process of building up the good forces of\r\nEurope, and will not, having completed the destruction of an enemy,\r\nleave us to our misfortunes,--what form should her aid take?\r\n\r\nI do not propose to enter on details. But the main outlines of all\r\nschemes for an international loan are much the same, The countries in a\r\nposition to lend assistance, the neutrals, the United Kingdom, and, for\r\nthe greater portion of the sum required, the United States, must provide\r\nforeign purchasing credits for all the belligerent countries of\r\ncontinental Europe, allied and ex-enemy alike. The aggregate sum\r\nrequired might not be so large as is sometimes supposed. Much might be\r\ndone, perhaps, with a fund of $1,000,000,000 in the first instance. This\r\nsum, even if a precedent of a different kind had been established by the\r\ncancellation of Inter-Ally War Debt, should be lent and should be\r\nborrowed with the unequivocal intention of its being repaid in full.\r\nWith this object in view, the security for the loan should be the best\r\nobtainable, and the arrangements for its ultimate repayment as complete\r\nas possible. In particular, it should rank, both for payment of interest\r\nand discharge of capital, in front of all Reparation claims, all\r\nInter-Ally War Debt, all internal war loans, and all other Government\r\nindebtedness of any other kind. Those borrowing countries who will be\r\nentitled to Reparation payments should be required to pledge all such\r\nreceipts to repayment of the new loan. And all the borrowing countries\r\nshould be required to place their customs duties on a gold basis and to\r\npledge such receipts to its service.\r\n\r\nExpenditure out of the loan should be subject to general, but not\r\ndetailed, supervision by the lending countries.\r\n\r\nIf, in addition to this loan for the purchase of food and materials, a\r\nguarantee fund were established up to an equal amount, namely\r\n$1,000,000,000 (of which it would probably prove necessary to find only\r\na part in cash), to which all members of the League of Nations would\r\ncontribute according to their means, it might be practicable to base\r\nupon it a general reorganization of the currency.\r\n\r\nIn this manner Europe might be equipped with the minimum amount of\r\nliquid resources necessary to revive her hopes, to renew her economic\r\norganization, and to enable her great intrinsic wealth to function for\r\nthe benefit of her workers. It is useless at the present time to\r\nelaborate such schemes in further detail. A great change is necessary in\r\npublic opinion before the proposals of this chapter can enter the region\r\nof practical politics, and we must await the progress of events as\r\npatiently as we can.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _The Relations of Central Europe to Russia_\r\n\r\nI have said very little of Russia in this book. The broad character of\r\nthe situation there needs no emphasis, and of the details we know almost\r\nnothing authentic. But in a discussion as to how the economic situation\r\nof Europe can be restored there are one or two aspects of the Russian\r\nquestion which are vitally important.\r\n\r\nFrom the military point of view an ultimate union of forces between\r\nRussia and Germany is greatly feared in some quarters. This would be\r\nmuch more likely to take place in the event of reactionary movements\r\nbeing successful in each of the two countries, whereas an effective\r\nunity of purpose between Lenin and the present essentially middle-class\r\nGovernment of Germany is unthinkable. On the other hand, the same people\r\nwho fear such a union are even more afraid of the success of Bolshevism;\r\nand yet they have to recognize that the only efficient forces for\r\nfighting it are, inside Russia, the reactionaries, and, outside Russia,\r\nthe established forces of order and authority in Germany. Thus the\r\nadvocates of intervention in Russia, whether direct or indirect, are at\r\nperpetual cross-purposes with themselves. They do not know what they\r\nwant; or, rather, they want what they cannot help seeing to be\r\nincompatibles. This is one of the reasons why their policy is so\r\ninconstant and so exceedingly futile.\r\n\r\nThe same conflict of purpose is apparent in the attitude of the Council\r\nof the Allies at Paris towards the present Government of Germany. A\r\nvictory of Spartacism in Germany might well be the prelude to Revolution\r\neverywhere: it would renew the forces of Bolshevism in Russia, and\r\nprecipitate the dreaded union of Germany and Russia; it would certainly\r\nput an end to any expectations which have been built on the financial\r\nand economic clauses of the Treaty of Peace. Therefore Paris does not\r\nlove Spartacus. But, on the other hand, a victory of reaction in Germany\r\nwould be regarded by every one as a threat to the security of Europe,\r\nand as endangering the fruits of victory and the basis of the Peace.\r\nBesides, a new military power establishing itself in the East, with its\r\nspiritual home in Brandenburg, drawing to itself all the military talent\r\nand all the military adventurers, all those who regret emperors and hate\r\ndemocracy, in the whole of Eastern and Central and South-Eastern Europe,\r\na power which would be geographically inaccessible to the military\r\nforces of the Allies, might well found, at least in the anticipations of\r\nthe timid, a new Napoleonic domination, rising, as a phoenix, from the\r\nashes of cosmopolitan militarism. So Paris dare not love Brandenburg.\r\nThe argument points, then, to the sustentation of those moderate forces\r\nof order, which, somewhat to the world's surprise, still manage to\r\nmaintain themselves on the rock of the German character. But the present\r\nGovernment of Germany stands for German unity more perhaps than for\r\nanything else; the signature of the Peace was, above all, the price\r\nwhich some Germans thought it worth while to pay for the unity which was\r\nall that was left them of 1870. Therefore Paris, with some hopes of\r\ndisintegration across the Rhine not yet extinguished, can resist no\r\nopportunity of insult or indignity, no occasion of lowering the\r\nprestige or weakening the influence of a Government, with the continued\r\nstability of which all the conservative interests of Europe are\r\nnevertheless bound up.\r\n\r\nThe same dilemma affects the future of Poland in the rÙle which France\r\nhas cast for her. She is to be strong, Catholic, militarist, and\r\nfaithful, the consort, or at least the favorite, of victorious France,\r\nprosperous and magnificent between the ashes of Russia and the ruin of\r\nGermany. Roumania, if only she could be persuaded to keep up appearances\r\na little more, is a part of the same scatter-brained conception. Yet,\r\nunless her great neighbors are prosperous and orderly, Poland is an\r\neconomic impossibility with no industry but Jew-baiting. And when Poland\r\nfinds that the seductive policy of France is pure rhodomontade and that\r\nthere is no money in it whatever, nor glory either, she will fall, as\r\npromptly as possible, into the arms of somebody else.\r\n\r\nThe calculations of \"diplomacy\" lead us, therefore, nowhere. Crazy\r\ndreams and childish intrigue in Russia and Poland and thereabouts are\r\nthe favorite indulgence at present of those Englishmen and Frenchmen who\r\nseek excitement in its least innocent form, and believe, or at least\r\nbehave as if foreign policy was of the same _genre_ as a cheap\r\nmelodrama.\r\n\r\nLet us turn, therefore, to something more solid. The German Government\r\nhas announced (October 30, 1919) its continued adhesion to a policy of\r\nnon-intervention in the internal affairs of Russia, \"not only on\r\nprinciple, but because it believes that this policy is also justified\r\nfrom a practical point of view.\" Let us assume that at last we also\r\nadopt the same standpoint, if not on principle, at least from a\r\npractical point of view. What are then the fundamental economic factors\r\nin the future relations of Central to Eastern Europe?\r\n\r\nBefore the war Western and Central Europe drew from Russia a substantial\r\npart of their imported cereals. Without Russia the importing countries\r\nwould have had to go short. Since 1914 the loss of the Russian supplies\r\nhas been made good, partly by drawing on reserves, partly from the\r\nbumper harvests of North America called forth by Mr. Hoover's guaranteed\r\nprice, but largely by economies of consumption and by privation. After\r\n1920 the need of Russian supplies will be even greater than it was\r\nbefore the war; for the guaranteed price in North America will have been\r\ndiscontinued, the normal increase of population there will, as compared\r\nwith 1914, have swollen the home demand appreciably, and the soil of\r\nEurope will not yet have recovered its former productivity. If trade is\r\nnot resumed with Russia, wheat in 1920-21 (unless the seasons are\r\nspecially bountiful) must be scarce and very dear. The blockade of\r\nRussia, lately proclaimed by the Allies, is therefore a foolish and\r\nshort-sighted proceeding; we are blockading not so much Russia as\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nThe process of reviving the Russian export trade is bound in any case to\r\nbe a slow one. The present productivity of the Russian peasant is not\r\nbelieved to be sufficient to yield an exportable surplus on the pre-war\r\nscale. The reasons for this are obviously many, but amongst them are\r\nincluded the insufficiency of agricultural implements and accessories\r\nand the absence of incentive to production caused by the lack of\r\ncommodities in the towns which the peasants can purchase in exchange for\r\ntheir produce. Finally, there is the decay of the transport system,\r\nwhich hinders or renders impossible the collection of local surpluses in\r\nthe big centers of distribution.\r\n\r\nI see no possible means of repairing this loss of productivity within\r\nany reasonable period of time except through the agency of German\r\nenterprise and organization. It is impossible geographically and for\r\nmany other reasons for Englishmen, Frenchmen, or Americans to undertake\r\nit;--we have neither the incentive nor the means for doing the work on a\r\nsufficient scale. Germany, on the other hand, has the experience, the\r\nincentive, and to a large extent the materials for furnishing the\r\nRussian peasant with the goods of which he has been starved for the\r\npast five years, for reorganizing the business of transport and\r\ncollection, and so for bringing into the world's pool, for the common\r\nadvantage, the supplies from which we are now so disastrously cut off.\r\nIt is in our interest to hasten the day when German agents and\r\norganizers will be in a position to set in train in every Russian\r\nvillage the impulses of ordinary economic motive. This is a process\r\nquite independent of the governing authority in Russia; but we may\r\nsurely predict with some certainty that, whether or not the form of\r\ncommunism represented by Soviet government proves permanently suited to\r\nthe Russian temperament, the revival of trade, of the comforts of life\r\nand of ordinary economic motive are not likely to promote the extreme\r\nforms of those doctrines of violence and tyranny which are the children\r\nof war and of despair.\r\n\r\nLet us then in our Russian policy not only applaud and imitate the\r\npolicy of non-intervention which the Government of Germany has\r\nannounced, but, desisting from a blockade which is injurious to our own\r\npermanent interests, as well as illegal, let us encourage and assist\r\nGermany to take up again her place in Europe as a creator and organizer\r\nof wealth for her Eastern and Southern neighbors.\r\n\r\nThere are many persons in whom such proposals will raise strong\r\nprejudices. I ask them to follow out in thought the result of yielding\r\nto these prejudices. If we oppose in detail every means by which Germany\r\nor Russia can recover their material well-being, because we feel a\r\nnational, racial, or political hatred for their populations or their\r\nGovernments, we must be prepared to face the consequences of such\r\nfeelings. Even if there is no moral solidarity between the\r\nnearly-related races of Europe, there is an economic solidarity which we\r\ncannot disregard. Even now, the world markets are one. If we do not\r\nallow Germany to exchange products with Russia and so feed herself, she\r\nmust inevitably compete with us for the produce of the New World. The\r\nmore successful we are in snapping economic relations between Germany\r\nand Russia, the more we shall depress the level of our own economic\r\nstandards and increase the gravity of our own domestic problems. This is\r\nto put the issue on its lowest grounds. There are other arguments, which\r\nthe most obtuse cannot ignore, against a policy of spreading and\r\nencouraging further the economic ruin of great countries.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI see few signs of sudden or dramatic developments anywhere. Riots and\r\nrevolutions there may be, but not such, at present, as to have\r\nfundamental significance. Against political tyranny and injustice\r\nRevolution is a weapon. But what counsels of hope can Revolution offer\r\nto sufferers from economic privation, which does not arise out of the\r\ninjustices of distribution but is general? The only safeguard against\r\nRevolution in Central Europe is indeed the fact that, even to the minds\r\nof men who are desperate, Revolution offers no prospect of improvement\r\nwhatever. There may, therefore, be ahead of us a long, silent process of\r\nsemi-starvation, and of a gradual, steady lowering of the standards of\r\nlife and comfort. The bankruptcy and decay of Europe, if we allow it to\r\nproceed, will affect every one in the long-run, but perhaps not in a way\r\nthat is striking or immediate.\r\n\r\nThis has one fortunate side. We may still have time to reconsider our\r\ncourses and to view the world with new eyes. For the immediate future\r\nevents are taking charge, and the near destiny of Europe is no longer in\r\nthe hands of any man. The events of the coming year will not be shaped\r\nby the deliberate acts of statesmen, but by the hidden currents, flowing\r\ncontinually beneath the surface of political history, of which no one\r\ncan predict the outcome. In one way only can we influence these hidden\r\ncurrents,--by setting in motion those forces of instruction and\r\nimagination which change _opinion_. The assertion of truth, the\r\nunveiling of illusion, the dissipation of hate, the enlargement and\r\ninstruction of men's hearts and minds, must be the means.\r\n\r\nIn this autumn of 1919, in which I write, we are at the dead season of\r\nour fortunes. The reaction from the exertions, the fears, and the\r\nsufferings of the past five years is at its height. Our power of feeling\r\nor caring beyond the immediate questions of our own material well-being\r\nis temporarily eclipsed. The greatest events outside our own direct\r\nexperience and the most dreadful anticipations cannot move us.\r\n\r\n                In each human heart terror survives\r\n    The ruin it has gorged: the loftiest fear\r\n    All that they would disdain to think were true:\r\n    Hypocrisy and custom make their minds\r\n    The fanes of many a worship, now outworn.\r\n    They dare not devise good for man's estate,\r\n    And yet they know not that they do not dare.\r\n    The good want power but to weep barren tears.\r\n    The powerful goodness want: worse need for them.\r\n    The wise want love; and those who love want wisdom;\r\n    And all best things are thus confused to ill.\r\n    Many are strong and rich, and would be just,\r\n    But live among their suffering fellow-men\r\n    As if none felt: they know not what they do.\r\n\r\nWe have been moved already beyond endurance, and need rest. Never in the\r\nlifetime of men now living has the universal element in the soul of man\r\nburnt so dimly.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons the true voice of the new generation has not yet\r\nspoken, and silent opinion is not yet formed. To the formation of the\r\ngeneral opinion of the future I dedicate this book.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[157] The figures for the United Kingdom are as follows:\r\n\r\n                         Net                  Excess of\r\n       Monthly         Imports     Exports     Imports\r\n       Average          $1,000      $1,000      $1,000\r\n\r\n               1913     274,650     218,850      55,800\r\n               1914     250,485     179,465      71,020\r\n    Jan.-Mar.  1919     547,890     245,610     302,280\r\n    April-June 1919     557,015     312,315     244,700\r\n    July-Sept. 1919     679,635     344,315     335,320\r\n\r\nBut this excess is by no means so serious as it looks; for with the\r\npresent high freight earnings of the mercantile marine the various\r\n\"invisible\" exports of the United Kingdom are probably even higher than\r\nthey were before the war, and may average at least $225,000,000 monthly.\r\n\r\n[158] President Wilson was mistaken in suggesting that the\r\nsupervision of Reparation payments has been entrusted to the League of\r\nNations. As I pointed out in Chapter V., whereas the League is invoked\r\nin regard to most of the continuing economic and territorial provisions\r\nof the Treaty, this is not the case as regards Reparation, over the\r\nproblems and modifications of which the Reparation Commission is supreme\r\nwithout appeal of any kind to the League of Nations.\r\n\r\n[159] These Articles, which provide safeguards against the\r\noutbreak of war between members of the League and also between members\r\nand non-members, are the solid achievement of the Covenant. These\r\nArticles make substantially less probable a war between organized Great\r\nPowers such as that of 1914. This alone should commend the League to all\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n[160] It would be expedient so to define a \"protectionist\r\ntariff\" as to permit (_a_) the total prohibition of certain imports;\r\n(_b_) the imposition of sumptuary or revenue customs duties on\r\ncommodities not produced at home; (_c_) the imposition of customs duties\r\nwhich did not exceed by more than five per cent a countervailing excise\r\non similar commodities produced at home; (_d_) export duties. Further,\r\nspecial exceptions might be permitted by a majority vote of the\r\ncountries entering the Union. Duties which had existed for five years\r\nprior to a country's entering the Union might be allowed to disappear\r\ngradually by equal instalments spread over the five years subsequent to\r\njoining the Union.\r\n\r\n[161] The figures in this table are partly estimated, and are\r\nprobably not completely accurate in detail; but they show the\r\napproximate figures with sufficient accuracy for the purposes of the\r\npresent argument. The British figures are taken from the White Paper of\r\nOctober 23, 1919 (Cmd. 377). In any actual settlement, adjustments would\r\nbe required in connection with certain loans of gold and also in other\r\nrespects, and I am concerned in what follows with the broad principle\r\nonly. The total excludes loans raised by the United Kingdom on the\r\nmarket in the United States, and loans raised by France on the market in\r\nthe United Kingdom or the United States, or from the Bank of England.\r\n\r\n[162] This allows nothing for interest on the debt since the\r\nBolshevik Revolution.\r\n\r\n[163] No interest has been charged on the advances made to\r\nthese countries.\r\n\r\n[164] The actual total of loans by the United States up to date\r\nis very nearly $10,000,000,000, but I have not got the latest details.\r\n\r\n[165] The financial history of the six months from the end of\r\nthe summer of 1916 up to the entry of the United States into the war in\r\nApril, 1917, remains to be written. Very few persons, outside the\r\nhalf-dozen officials of the British Treasury who lived in daily contact\r\nwith the immense anxieties and impossible financial requirements of\r\nthose days, can fully realize what steadfastness and courage were\r\nneeded, and how entirely hopeless the task would soon have become\r\nwithout the assistance of the United States Treasury. The financial\r\nproblems from April, 1917, onwards were of an entirely different order\r\nfrom those of the preceding months.\r\n\r\n[166] Mr. Hoover was the only man who emerged from the ordeal\r\nof Paris with an enhanced reputation. This complex personality, with his\r\nhabitual air of weary Titan (or, as others might put it, of exhausted\r\nprize-fighter), his eyes steadily fixed on the true and essential facts\r\nof the European situation, imported into the Councils of Paris, when he\r\ntook part in them, precisely that atmosphere of reality, knowledge,\r\nmagnanimity, and disinterestedness which, if they had been found in\r\nother quarters also, would have given us the Good Peace.\r\n\r\n[167] Even after the United States came into the war the bulk\r\nof Russian expenditure in the United States, as well as the whole of\r\nthat Government's other foreign expenditure, had to be paid for by the\r\nBritish Treasury.\r\n\r\n[168] It is reported that the United States Treasury has agreed\r\nto fund (_i.e._ to add to the principal sum) the interest owing them on\r\ntheir loans to the Allied Governments during the next three years. I\r\npresume that the British Treasury is likely to follow suit. If the debts\r\nare to be paid ultimately, this piling up of the obligations at compound\r\ninterest makes the position progressively worse. But the arrangement\r\nwisely offered by the United States Treasury provides a due interval for\r\nthe calm consideration of the whole problem in the light of the\r\nafter-war position as it will soon disclose itself.",
