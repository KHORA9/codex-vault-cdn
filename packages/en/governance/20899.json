II.--NOVEMBER, 1862.--NO. V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF THE REBELLION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo other nation was ever convulsed by an internal struggle so tremendous\r\nas that which now rends our own unhappy country. No mere rebellion has\r\never before spread its calamitous effects so widely, beyond the scene of\r\nits immediate horrors. Just in proportion to the magnitude of the evils\r\nit has produced, is the enormity of the crime involved, on one side or\r\nthe other; and good men may well feel solicitous to know where rests the\r\nburden of this awful responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe long train of preparatory events preceding the outbreak, and the\r\nextraordinary acts by which the conspirators signalized its\r\ncommencement, point, with sufficient certainty, to the incendiaries who\r\nproduced the vast conflagration, and who appear to be responsible for\r\nthe ruin which has ensued. But it remains to inquire by what means the\r\ngreat mass of inflammable materials was accumulated and made ready to\r\ntake fire at the touch; what justification there may be for the authors\r\nof the fatal act, or what palliation of the guilt which seems to rest\r\nupon them. The reputation of the American people, and of the free\r\ngovernment which is their pride and glory, must suffer in the estimation\r\nof mankind, unless they can be fairly acquitted of all responsibility\r\nfor the civil war, which not only desolates large portions of our own\r\ncountry, but seriously interferes with the prosperity of multitudinous\r\nclasses, and the stability of large industrial interests, in other\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nNeither in the physical nor in the moral world, can the effects of any\r\nphenomenon go beyond the nature and extent of its causes. Mighty\r\nconvulsions, like that which now shakes this continent, must have their\r\nroots in far distant times, and must gather their nutriment of passion\r\nand violence from a wide field of sympathetic opinion. No influence of\r\nmere individuals, no sudden acts of government even, no temporary causes\r\nof any nature whatsoever, are adequate to produce results so widespread\r\nand astounding. The social forces which contend in such a conflict, must\r\nhave been 'nursing their wrath' and gathering their strength for years,\r\nin order to exhibit the gigantic death-struggle, in which they are now\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\nGen. Jackson, after having crushed the incipient rebellion of 1832,\r\nwrote, in a private letter, recently published, that the next attempt to\r\noverthrow the Union would be instigated by the same party, but based\r\nupon the question of slavery.\r\n\r\nThat single-hearted patriot, in his boundless devotion to the Union,\r\nseemed to be gifted with almost preternatural foresight; nor did he\r\nexhibit greater sagacity in penetrating the motives and purposes of men,\r\nthan in comprehending the nature and influence of great social causes,\r\nthen in operation, and destined, as he clearly foresaw, to be wielded by\r\nwicked men as instruments of stupendous mischief to the country. His\r\nextraordinary prevision of the present attempt to overthrow the Union,\r\nsignalizes the evident affiliation of this rebellion with that which he\r\nso wisely and energetically destroyed in embryo, by means of the\r\ncelebrated proclamation and force bill.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, only in the real motive and ultimate object of the\r\nconspirators of 1832, that the attempt of South Carolina at that time\r\nwas the lineal progenitor of the rebellion of the present day. The\r\npurpose was the same in both cases, but the means chosen at the two\r\nepochs were altogether different. In the first attempt, the purpose was,\r\nindeed, to break up the Union and to establish a separate confederacy;\r\nbut this was to be done upon the ground of alleged inequality and\r\noppression, as well as unconstitutionality, in the mode of levying\r\nduties upon foreign importations. The attempt, however, proved to be\r\naltogether premature. The question involved, being neither geographical\r\nnor sectional in character, was not then, if it could ever be,\r\nsusceptible of being made the instrument of concentrating and\r\nintensifying hostile opinion against the federal power. Louisiana, with\r\nher great sugar interest, was a tariff State, and advocated protection\r\nas ardently as it was opposed in the greater part of the North-West, and\r\nin extensive districts of the North. She was not even invited to join\r\nthe proposed confederacy. Kentucky, Maryland, and Delaware were decided\r\nin their support of the protective policy, while Tennessee, Missouri,\r\nand North Carolina were divided on the question. Mr. Calhoun himself,\r\nthe very prophet of nullification, could not obliterate the memory of\r\nhis own former opinions, and it was difficult to induce the people to\r\ncoöperate in overthrowing the Federal Government, simply for adopting a\r\npolicy which the very authors of this movement had themselves so\r\nrecently thoroughly approved.\r\n\r\nThus, opinion was broken into fragments; and nowhere outside of South\r\nCarolina did it acquire sufficient unanimity and power to impart any\r\ngreat momentum to the revolutionary design. Besides, in the absence of\r\nclear and deep convictions, the question itself was of such a nature,\r\nthat strong passions could not easily spring from it. The interests\r\ninvolved were not necessarily in conflict; their opposition was more\r\napparent than real, so that an adjustment could readily be made without\r\nsacrifice of principle. In short, the subject of dispute did not contain\r\nwithin itself the elements of civil war, capable of development to that\r\nextreme, at the time and under the circumstances when the futile attempt\r\nat separation was made. Doubtless, the sinister exertions of restless\r\nand ambitious men, acting upon ignorant prejudices, might, under some\r\ncircumstances, have engendered opinions, even upon the tariff question,\r\nsufficiently strong and violent for the production of civil commotion.\r\nHad the conditions been more favorable to the plot; had the conspirators\r\nof that day been as well prepared as those of 1861; had they been\r\nequally successful in sowing dissatisfaction and hatred in the minds of\r\nthe Southern people; had they found in Gen. Jackson the weak and pliant\r\ninstrument of treason which James Buchanan afterward became in the hands\r\nof Davis and his coadjutors, the present rebellion might have been\r\nanticipated, and the germ of secession wholly extirpated and destroyed,\r\nin the contest which would then have ensued. The Union would doubtless\r\nhave been maintained, and, in the end, strengthened; the fatal element\r\nof discord would scarcely have survived to work and plot in secret for\r\nmore than a quarter of a century. It is true, slavery would have\r\nremained; but in the absence of other causes, slavery would not\r\nnecessarily have brought the country to the present crisis. Providence\r\nmay have so ordered the events of that day as to leave the revolutionary\r\nelement in existence, in order that it might eventually fasten upon\r\nslavery as the instrument of its treason, and thus bring this system,\r\ncondemned alike by the lessons of experience and by the moral sense of\r\nmankind, to that complete eventual destruction, which seems to be\r\ninevitably approaching.\r\n\r\nThe idea of an independent Southern confederacy, to be constituted of a\r\nfragment of the Union, survived the contest of 1832, and has been\r\ncherished with zeal and enthusiasm, by a small party of malcontents,\r\nfrom that day to this. Either from honest conviction or from the syren\r\nseductions of ambition, or perhaps from that combination of both which\r\nso often misleads the judgment of the wisest and best of men, this party\r\nhas pursued its end with unrivalled zeal and consummate tact, never for\r\na single moment abating its efforts to convince the South of the\r\nadvantages of separation. But all its ability and all its untiring\r\nlabors failed to make any serious impression, until the great and\r\npowerful interest of slavery was enlisted in the cause, and used as the\r\nmeans of reaching the feelings, and arousing the prejudices of the\r\nSouthern people. The theories of nullification and secession, while\r\naccepted by many leading minds in that section, never made any serious\r\nimpression upon the mass of the people. Indeed, it may be said with\r\ntruth, that the honest instincts of the people invariably rejected these\r\npernicious and dangerous theories, whenever they were distinctly\r\ninvolved in the elections. Nevertheless, there was an undercurrent of\r\nopinion in favor of them: the minds of the people were familiarized with\r\nthe doctrines, and thus made ready to embrace them, whenever they should\r\nbe satisfied it was indispensable to their safety and liberty to avail\r\nthemselves of their benefit.\r\n\r\nThese abstract principles, however industriously and successfully\r\ntaught, would not of themselves have availed to urge the people on to\r\nthe desperate contest into which they have been madly precipitated. The\r\ndogma of the right of secession was not left a mere barren idea: it was\r\naccompanied with constant teachings respecting the incompatibility of\r\ninterests, and the inevitable conflict, between the North and the South;\r\nthe superiority of slavery over every other form of labor; and the\r\nimminent danger of the overthrow of this benign institution by Northern\r\nfanaticism, and by the unfriendly influence of the commercial and\r\nfinancial policy of that section. Thus, the mischievous error of\r\nsecession was roused to life and action by the exhibition of those\r\nunreal phantoms, so often conjured up to frighten the South--abolition,\r\nagrarianism, and protective oppression.\r\n\r\nAll these deceptive ideas were required to be infused into the minds of\r\nthe people, in order to prepare the way for rebellious action. The right\r\nof secession was an indispensable condition, without which there could\r\nbe no justification for the violent measures to be adopted. No\r\nconsiderable number of American citizens could be found ready to lay\r\ntreasonable hands upon their government; but a great step would be taken\r\nif they could be convinced that the constitution provided for its own\r\nabrogation, and that the act of destruction could at any time be legally\r\nand regularly accomplished. The absolute humanity, justice, and morality\r\nof slavery, its excellence as a social institution, and its efficiency\r\nin maintaining order and insuring progress, must be fully established\r\nand universally admitted, in order to enlist the powerful motives of\r\nself-interest on the side of the projected revolution. And finally, it\r\nwas necessary to show that the divine institution was in danger, that\r\nthe free labor of the North was actively hostile to it and planning its\r\nruin, and that this hostility was to be aided by all the selfish desires\r\nof the protectionists and the dangerous violence of the agrarian\r\n'mudsills' of the other section. It was not of the least importance that\r\nthese statements or any of them should be true. Let them be thoroughly\r\nbelieved by the people, and that conviction would answer all the\r\npurposes of the conspirators. Accordingly, for more than a quarter of a\r\ncentury, these heresies and falsehoods were most industriously instilled\r\ninto the minds of the Southern people, of whom the great mass are\r\nunfortunately, and, from their peculiar condition, necessarily, kept in\r\nthat state of ignorance which would favor the reception of such\r\nincredible and monstrous fallacies.\r\n\r\nThe argument as to the right of secession has been exhausted; and if it\r\nhad not been, it does not come within the scope and design of this paper\r\nto discuss the question. Enemies of the United States, foreign and\r\ndomestic, will continue to believe, or at least to profess to believe\r\nand try to convince themselves, that the Constitution of 1787, which\r\nsuperseded the Confederation, contained all the defects of the latter\r\nwhich it was specially designed to remedy,--that the league of the\r\npreceding period was prolonged in the succeeding organization, only to\r\nbe the fatal object of future discontent and ambition. Certainly this\r\ndoctrine is the basis of the rebellion, and without it no successful\r\nmovement could have been made to secure cooperation from any of the\r\nStates. Nevertheless, it cannot be considered one of the impelling\r\ncauses which moved the rebellious States to action, for it is not of\r\nitself an active principle. It rather served to smooth the way, by\r\nremoving obstacles which opposed the operation of real motives.\r\nVeneration for the work of the fathers of the republic, respect for the\r\nConstitution and love of the Union, as things of infinite value, worthy\r\nto be cherished and defended, stood in the way of the conspiracy which\r\ncompassed the destruction of the government. It was necessary to remove\r\nthis obstacle, and to eradicate these patriotic sentiments, which had\r\ntaken strong hold of the minds and hearts of the people of both\r\nsections. For more than two generations the Union had been held sacred,\r\nbeyond all other earthly blessings. It was an object of the first\r\nmagnitude to unsettle this long-cherished sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators were altogether too shrewd and full of tact to approach\r\ntheir object directly. They adopted the artifice of arousing and\r\nstudiously cultivating another sentiment of equal strength, which should\r\nspring up side by side with their love of the Union, flourish for a time\r\nin friendly cooperation with it, but ultimately supplant and entirely\r\nsupersede it. This was the plausible and attractive sentiment of State\r\npride, concealing in itself the idea of perfect sovereignty, with the\r\nright of nullification and secession. With consummate ability, with\r\nuntiring industry and perseverance, and without a moment's cessation for\r\nmore than a quarter of a century, this fruitful but pernicious seed of\r\ndisorganization was sown broadcast among the Southern people. So long as\r\nthere was no occasion to put the theory into practice, there seemed to\r\nbe no ground for alarm. The question was one rather of curious subtlety\r\nthan of practical importance. Meanwhile, the minds of men became\r\nfamiliar with the thought; they entertained it without aversion; the\r\ngerms of ultimate discord and dissolution silently took root, and slowly\r\ngrew up in the understandings of men. Not that the principle was\r\nadopted; it was rather tolerated than accepted. But this was the very\r\nthing intended by the wily conspirators. They expected nothing better;\r\nfor they knew well that an accident or a bold precipitation of events\r\nwould cause the popular mind to seize this principle and use it, as the\r\nonly justification for revolutionary violence. Thus this doctrine, which\r\nis the embodiment of anarchy, was carefully prepared for the occasion,\r\nand artfully placed within easy mental reach of those who would be\r\ncalled upon to wield it.\r\n\r\n_Pari passu_ with the dissemination and growth of this dangerous\r\nopinion, the political school which cherished it endeavored to promote\r\nthe object steadily held in view, by restricting and embarrassing the\r\naction of the Federal Government in every possible way. Notwithstanding\r\nthe distrust and aversion of the Jackson party against them, continued\r\nlong after the events of 1832, they succeeded in forming, first a\r\ncoalition, and finally a thorough union with the great popular\r\norganization--the democratic party. Holding the balance of power between\r\nthat party and their opponents, they dictated terms to the successive\r\ndemocratic conventions, and, in effect, controlled their nominations and\r\ntheir policy. They imposed upon that party the formidable dogma of 'a\r\nstrict construction of the Constitution,' and under that plausible\r\npretext, denied to the Government the exercise of every useful power\r\nnecessary to make it strong and efficient within the limits of its\r\nlegitimate functions. Their evident object, though cautiously and\r\nsuccessfully concealed, was to weaken the Federal Government, and build\r\nup the power of the separate States, so that the former, shorn of its\r\nconstitutional vigor, and crippled in its proper field of action, might,\r\nat the critical moment, fall an easy prey to their iniquitous designs.\r\nThe navigation of the great Mississippi river, the imperial highway of\r\nthe continent, could not be improved, because every impediment taken\r\naway, and every facility given to commerce on its bosom, were so much\r\nstrength added to the bonds of the Union. The harbors of the great lakes\r\nand of the Atlantic coast could not be rendered secure by the agency of\r\nthe Federal Government, because every beneficent act of this nature\r\nfixed it more firmly in the affections of the people, and gave it\r\nadditional influence at home and abroad. The great Pacific railroad--a\r\nmeasure of infinite importance to the unity of the nation, to the\r\ndevelopment of the country, and to the general prosperity, as well as to\r\nthe public defence--a work so grand in its proportions, and so universal\r\nin its benefits, that only the power of a great nation was equal to its\r\naccomplishment or capable and worthy of its proper control--this great\r\nand indispensable measure was defeated from year to year, so long as the\r\nconspirators remained in Congress to oppose it, and was only passed in\r\nthe end, after they had launched the rebellion, and made their open\r\nattack against the Government, which they had so long sought to\r\nembarrass and weaken, in view of this very contingency.\r\n\r\nWhile yielding these principles in theory, the democratic party did not\r\nalways adhere to them in practice. The instinct of patriotism was often\r\nstronger than the obligations of party necessity and party policy.\r\nMoreover, the text of these doctrines in the democratic creed was\r\nfrequently a subject of grave dispute in the party, and unanimity never\r\nprevailed in regard to it. Yet the subtle poison infused into the body\r\nof the organization, extended its baleful influence to all questions,\r\nand too often paralyzed the arm of the Government in every field of its\r\nappropriate action.\r\n\r\nNever was presented in history a better illustration of the effect of\r\nfalse and mischievous ideas. It would be unjust, because it would be\r\nuntrue, to suspect the democratic party of any clear knowledge of the\r\nends to which these principles were intended to lead, or of any\r\nparticipation in the treasonable purpose. Many members of that party saw\r\nthe danger in time, and abandoned the organization before it was caught\r\nin the meshes of the great conspiracy. Some, however, even in the loyal\r\nStates, clung to Breckinridge and the fatal abstractions of the party\r\ncreed, until these reached their final and legitimate culmination, in\r\nthe ghastly paralysis of the most indispensable functions of the\r\nGovernment--the ruinous abnegation of all power of self-defence--the\r\ntreacherous attempt at national suicide only failing for want of courage\r\nto perpetrate the supreme act, which was exhibited by the administration\r\nof James Buchanan, in its last hours, when it proclaimed the doctrine of\r\nsecession to be unfounded in constitutional right, and yet denied the\r\npower of the Government to prevent its own destruction. The threats of\r\nan imperious band of traitors, operating upon the fears of a weak old\r\nman, who was already implicated in the treason, drove him to the verge\r\nof the abyss into which he was willing to plunge his country, but from\r\nwhich, at the last moment, he drew back, dismayed at the thought of\r\nsacrificing himself.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of secession, long and laboriously taught, and the cognate\r\nprinciples calculated to diminish the power of the Federal Government\r\nand magnify that of the States, thus served to smooth the way, to lay\r\nthe track, upon which the engine of rebellion was to be started. But\r\nthere was still wanting the motive power which should impel the machine\r\nand give it energy and momentum. Something tangible was\r\nrequired--something palpable to the masses--on the basis of which\r\nviolent antagonisms and hatreds could be engendered, and fearful dangers\r\ncould be pictured to the popular imagination.\r\n\r\nThe protective system, loudly denounced as unequal and oppressive, as\r\nwell as unconstitutional, had proved wholly insufficient to arouse\r\nrebellion in 1832. It would have proved equally so in 1861: but then the\r\nultra free trade tariff of 1856 was still in existence; and it continued\r\nin force, until, to increase dissatisfaction, and invite the very system\r\nwhich they pretended to oppose and deplore, the conspirators in\r\nCongress, having power to defeat the 'Morrill Tariff,' deliberately\r\nstepped aside, and suffered it to become a law. But this was merely a\r\npiece of preliminary strategy intended to give them some advantage in\r\nthe great battle which was eventually to be fought on other fields. It\r\nmight throw some additional weight into their scale; it might give them\r\nsome plausible ground for hypocritical complaint; and might even, to\r\nsome extent, serve to hide the real ground of their movement; yet, of\r\nitself, it could never be decisive of anything. It could neither justify\r\nrevolution in point of morals, nor could it blind the people of the\r\nSouth to the terrible calamities which the experiment of secession was\r\ndestined to bring upon them.\r\n\r\nSlavery alone, with the vast material prosperity apparently created by\r\nit, with the debatable and exciting questions, moral, political, and\r\nsocial, which arise out of it, and with the palpable dangers, which, in\r\nspite of every effort to deny it, plainly brood over the system--slavery\r\nalone had the power to produce the civil war, and to shake the continent\r\nto its foundations. In the present crisis of the struggle, it would be a\r\nwaste of time and of thought to attempt to trace back to its origin the\r\nlong current of excitement on the slavery question, beginning in 1834,\r\nand swelling in magnitude until the present day; or to seek to fix the\r\nresponsibility for the various events which marked its progress, from\r\nthe earliest agitation down to the great rebellion, which is evidently\r\nthe consummation and the end of it all. The only lesson important to be\r\nlearned, and that which is the sum of all these great events, plainly\r\ntaught by the history of this generation, and destined to characterize\r\nit in all future time, is, that slavery had in itself the germs of this\r\nprofound agitation, and that, for thirty years, it stirred the moral and\r\npolitical elements of this nation as no other cause had power to do. It\r\nis of little consequence, for the purpose in view, to inquire what\r\nantagonisms struggled with slavery in this immense contest, covering so\r\ngreat an area in space, and so long a period of time. All ideas and all\r\ninterests were involved. Moral, social, political, and economical\r\nconsiderations clashed and antagonized in the gigantic conflict.\r\n\r\nIs slavery right or wrong? Has it the sanction of enlightened\r\nconscience, or of the divine law as revealed in the Old and New\r\nTestaments? The last words of this moral contest have scarcely yet\r\nceased to reverberate in our ears, even while the sound of cannon tells\r\nof other arguments and another arbitrament, which must soon cut short\r\nall the jargon of the logicians. But one of the most remarkable features\r\nof the whole case, has been the indignation with which the slave\r\ninterest, from beginning to end, has resisted the discussion of these\r\nmoral questions. As if such inquiries could, by any possibility, be\r\nprevented! As if a system, good and right in itself, defensible in the\r\nlight of sound reason, could suffer by the fullest examination which\r\ncould be made in private or in public, or by the profoundest agitation\r\nwhich could arise from the use of mere moral means! The discussions, the\r\nagitations, and all the fierce passions which attended them, were\r\nunavoidable. Human nature must be changed and wholly revolutionized\r\nbefore such agitations can be suppressed. They are the means appointed\r\nby the Creator for the progress of humanity. The seeds of them are\r\nplanted in the heart of man, and, in the sunshine and air of freedom,\r\nthey must germinate and grow, and eventually produce such fruit as the\r\neternal laws of God have made necessary from the beginning.\r\n\r\nThe social question shaped itself amidst the turbulent elements, and\r\ncame out clear and well defined, in the perfect contrast and antagonism\r\nof the two sectional systems. Free labor, educated, skilful, prosperous,\r\nself-poised, and independent, grew into great strength, and accumulated\r\nuntold wealth, in all the States in which slavery had been supplanted.\r\nUnexampled and prodigious inventive energy had multiplied the physical\r\npower of men by millions, and these wonderful creations of wealth and\r\npower seemed destined to have no bounds in the favored region in which\r\nthis system of free labor prevailed. Immigration, attracted by this\r\nboundless prosperity, flowed in with a steady stream, and an overflowing\r\npopulation was fast spreading the freedom and prosperity of the Northern\r\nStates to all the uncultivated regions of the Union.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, by a sort of social repulsion--a sort of polarity\r\nwhich intensifies opposition and repugnance--the theory of slavery was\r\ncarried to an extreme never before known in the history of mankind.\r\nCapital claimed to own labor, as the best relation in which the two\r\ncould be placed toward each other. The masses of men, compelled to spend\r\ntheir lives in physical toil, were held to be properly kept in\r\nignorance, under the guidance of intelligent masters. The skilful\r\ncontrol of the master, when applied to slaves, was hold to be superior\r\nin its results to the self-regulating energies of educated men, laboring\r\nfor their own benefit, and impelled by the powerful motives of\r\nself-interest and independent enterprise. The safety of society demanded\r\nthe subordination of the laboring class; and especially in free\r\ngovernments, where the representative system prevails, was it necessary\r\nthat working men should be held in subjection. Slavery, therefore, was\r\nnot only justifiable; it was the only possible condition on which free\r\nsociety could be organized, and liberal institutions maintained. This\r\nwas 'the corner stone' of the new confederacy. The opposite system in\r\nthe free States, at the first touch of internal trouble and civil war,\r\nwould prove the truth of the new theory by bread riots and agrarian\r\noverthrow of property and of all other institutions held sacred in the\r\ntrue conditions of social order.\r\n\r\nSuch was the monstrous inversion of social phenomena which the Southern\r\nmind accepted at the hands of their leading men, and conceived to be\r\npossible in this advanced age of the world. Seizing upon a system\r\ncompatible only with the earliest steps in the progress of man, and\r\nsuitable only to the moral sentiments and unenlightened ideas of the\r\nmost backward races of the world, they undertook to naturalize and\r\nestablish it--nay, to perpetuate it, and to build up society on its\r\nbasis--in the nineteenth century, and among the people of one of the\r\nfreest and most enlightened nations! Evidently, this was a monstrous\r\nperversion of intellect--a blindness and madness scarcely finding a\r\nparallel in history. It was expected, too, that this anomalous social\r\nproceeding--this backward march of civilization on this continent--would\r\nexcite no animadversion and arouse no antagonism in the opposite\r\nsection. It involved the reopening of the slave trade, and it was\r\nexpected that foreign nations would abate their opposition, lower their\r\nflags, and suffer the new empire, founded on 'the corner stone of\r\nslavery,' to march forward in triumph and achieve its splendid destiny.\r\n\r\nThese moral and social ideas might have had greater scope to work out\r\ntheir natural results, had not the political connections between the\r\nNorth and the South implicated the two sections, alike, in the\r\nconsequences of any error or folly on the part of either. Taxation and\r\nrepresentation, and the surrender of fugitive slaves, all provided for\r\nin the Constitution, were the points in which the opposite polities came\r\ninto contact in the ordinary workings of the Federal Government.\r\nPerpetual conflicts necessarily arose. But it was chiefly on the\r\nquestion of territorial extension, and in the formation of new States,\r\nthat the most inveterate of all the contests were engendered. The\r\nconstitutional provisions applicable to these questions are not without\r\nsome obscurity, and this afforded a plausible opportunity for all the\r\nimpracticable subtleties arising out of the doctrine of strict\r\nconstruction. From the time of the admission of Missouri, in 1820, down\r\nto the recent controversy about Kansas, the territorial question was\r\nunsettled, and never failed to be the cause of terrible agitation.\r\n\r\nBut the march of events soon superseded the question; and even while the\r\ncontest was fiercest and most bitter, the silent operation of general\r\ncauses was sweeping away the whole ground of dispute. The growth of\r\npopulation in the Northern States was so unexampled, and so far exceeded\r\nthat of the Southern States, that there could be no actual rivalry in\r\nthe settlement of the territories. The latter already had more territory\r\nthan they could possibly occupy and people. While the Northern\r\npopulation, swollen by European emigration, was taking possession of the\r\nnew territories and filling them with industry and prosperity, slavery\r\nwas repelling white emigration, and the South, from sheer want of men,\r\nwas wholly unable to meet the competition. Yet, with most unreasonable\r\nclamors, intended only to arouse the passions of the ignorant, Southern\r\nstatesmen insisted on establishing the law of slavery where they could\r\nnot plant the institution itself. They finally demanded that slavery\r\nshould be recognized everywhere within the national domain; and that the\r\nFederal power should be pledged for its protection, even against the\r\nvotes of the majority of the people. This was nothing less than an\r\nattempt to check the growth of the country, by the exclusion of free\r\nStates, when it was impossible to increase it by the addition of any\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nUpon the failure of this monstrous demand, civil war was to be\r\ninaugurated! A power which had been relatively dwindling and diminishing\r\nfrom the beginning--which, in the very nature of things, could not\r\nmaintain its equality in numbers and in constitutional weight--this\r\nminority demanded the control of the Government, in its growth, and in\r\nall its policy, and, in the event of refusal, threatened to rend and\r\ndestroy it. Such pretensions could not have been made with sincerity.\r\nThey were but the sinister means of exciting sectional enmities,\r\nand preparing for the final measures of the great conspiracy.\r\nHaving discarded the rational and humane views of their own\r\nfathers--Washington, Jefferson, Madison, and others--it was but the\r\nnatural sequel that they should signalize their degeneracy by aiming to\r\noverthrow the work in which those sages had embodied their generous\r\nideas--the Constitution of the United States and the whole fabric of\r\ngovernment resting upon it.\r\n\r\nIn what manner these mischievous absurdities became acceptable to the\r\nSouthern people--by what psychological miracle so great a transformation\r\nwas accomplished in so short a time--is only to be explained by\r\nexamining some of the delusions which blinded the authors of the\r\nrebellion, and enabled them to mislead the masses who confided too\r\nimplicitly in the leadership of their masters.\r\n\r\nWeak as were the Southern people in point of numbers and political\r\npower, compared with those of the opposite section, the haughty\r\nslaveholders easily persuaded themselves and their dependents that they\r\ncould successfully cope in arms with the Northern adversary, whom they\r\naffected to despise for his cowardly and mercenary disposition. Wealth,\r\neducation, and ample leisure gave them the best opportunity for\r\npolitical studies and public employments. Long experience imparted skill\r\nin all the arts of government, and enabled them, by superior ability, to\r\ncontrol the successive administrations at Washington. Proud and\r\nconfident, they indulged the belief that their great political prestige\r\nwould continue to serve them among their late party associates in the\r\nNorth, and that the counsels of the adversary would be distracted, and\r\nhis power weakened, by the fatal effects of dissension. All warlike\r\nsentiment and capacity was believed to be extinct among the traders and\r\nmanufacturers, 'the shopkeepers and pedlars,' of the Middle and Eastern\r\nStates. Hence a vigorous attack in arms against the Federal Government\r\nwas expected to be met with no energetic and effective resistance. A\r\npeaceable dissolution of the Union, and the impossibility of war--at\r\nleast of any serious and prolonged hostilities--was a cardinal point in\r\nthe teachings of the secessionists. The fraudulent as well as violent\r\nmeasures by which they sought to disarm the Federal Government and to\r\nforestall its action, were only adopted 'to make assurance doubly sure.'\r\n\r\nBeyond all doubt, the system of slavery encourages those habits and\r\npassions which make the soldier, and which instigate and maintain wars.\r\nThe military spirit and that of slavery are congenial; for both belong\r\nto an early stage in the progress of civilization, when each is\r\nnecessary to the support and continuance of the other. It was therefore\r\nto be expected that the Southern people would be better prepared for the\r\norganization, and also for the manoeuvring of armies. But the mistake\r\nand the fatal delusion cherished by the conspirators, was the belief\r\nthat the Northern people were without manly spirit, and incapable of\r\nbeing aroused by sentiments of patriotism. It was an equal\r\nmiscalculation to anticipate that the fabric of Northern free society\r\nwould fall to pieces, and be thrown into irremediable disorder, at the\r\nfirst appearance of civil commotion. This false idea was the offspring\r\nof the slave system, which boasted of the solidity of its own\r\norganization and the impossibility of its overthrow. From their\r\nstandpoint, amid the darkness of a social organization, in which one\r\nhalf the population is not more than semi-civilized, the slaveholders\r\ncould not easily obtain any other view. Long accustomed to wield\r\nirresponsible power as masters, enjoying wealth and independence from\r\nthe unrewarded labor of the slave, but liberal and humane, condescending\r\nand indulgent, so long as the untutored black was quiet and obedient,\r\nthe planter very naturally imagined his system to be the perfection of\r\nsocial order. In the atmosphere of luxurious ease which surrounded him,\r\nwere the elements of a mental mirage which distorted everything in his\r\ndeceptive vision. He weighed the two systems, and found his own\r\nimmeasurably more powerful than its antagonist. Fatal mistake! fatal but\r\ninevitable, in his condition, in the midst of the blinding refractions\r\nof the medium which enveloped him.\r\n\r\nProsperity had made him giddy. Cotton was not merely King--it was God.\r\nMoral considerations were nothing. The sentiment of right, he argued,\r\nwould have no influence over starving operatives; and England and\r\nFrance, as well as the Eastern States of the Union, would stand aghast\r\nand yield to the masterstroke which should deprive them of the material\r\nof their labor. Millions were dependent on it in all the great centres\r\nof civilization, and the ramifications of its power extended into all\r\nranks of society and all departments of industry and commerce. It was\r\nonly necessary to wave this imperial sceptre over the nations, and all\r\nof them would fall prostrate and acknowledge the supremacy of the power\r\nwhich wielded it. Nothing could be more plausible than this delusion.\r\nSatan himself, when about to wage war in heaven, could not have invented\r\none better calculated to marshal his hosts and give promise of success\r\nin rebellion against the authority of the Most High. But alas! the\r\nsupreme error of this anticipation lay in omitting from the calculation\r\nall power of principle. The right still has authority over the minds of\r\nmen and in the counsels of nations. Factories may cease their din; men\r\nand women may be thrown out of employment; the marts of commerce may be\r\nsilent and deserted; but truth and justice still command some respect\r\namong men, and God yet remains the object of their adoration.\r\n\r\nDrunk with power and dazzled with prosperity, monopolizing cotton, and\r\nraising it to the influence of a veritable fetich, the authors of the\r\nrebellion did not admit a doubt of the success of their attack on the\r\nFederal Government. They dreamed of perpetuating slavery, though all\r\nhistory shows the decline of the system as industry, commerce, and\r\nknowledge advance. The slaveholders proposed nothing less than to\r\nreverse the currents of humanity, and to make barbarism flourish in the\r\nbosom of civilization. They even thought of extending the system, by\r\nopening the slave trade and enlarging the boundaries of their projected\r\nempire, Mexico and Central America, Cuba and St. Domingo, with the whole\r\nWest Indian group of islands, awaited the consolidation of their power,\r\nand stood ready to swell the glory of their triumph.\r\n\r\nBut these enticing visions quickly faded away from their sight. At an\r\nearly day after the inauguration of their government, they were\r\ncompelled to disavow the design of reopening the slave trade, and in no\r\nevent is it probable their recognition will be yielded by foreign\r\ngovernments, except on the basis of ultimate emancipation. How such a\r\nproposition will be received by their deluded followers, remains yet to\r\nbe ascertained by an experiment which the authors of the rebellion will\r\nbe slow to try among their people. One of the most effective appeals\r\nmade to the non-slaveholders of the South, in order to start the\r\nrevolution, was to their fears and prejudices against the threatened\r\nequality and competition of the emancipated negro. The immense influence\r\nof this appeal can scarcely be estimated by those not intimately\r\nacquainted with the social condition of the great mass of the Southern\r\npeople. Among them, the distinction of color is maintained with the\r\nutmost rigor, and the barrier between the two races, social and\r\npolitical, is held to be impassable and eternal. The smallest taint of\r\nAfrican blood in the veins of any man is esteemed a degradation from\r\nwhich he can never recover. Toward the negro, as an inferior, the white\r\nman is often affable and kind, cruelty being the exception, universally\r\ncondemned and often punished; but toward the black man as an equal, an\r\nimplacable hostility is instantly arrayed. This intense and\r\nunconquerable prejudice, it is well known, is not confined wholly to the\r\nSouth; but it prevails there without dissent, and is, in fact, one of\r\nthe fundamental principles of social organization.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, the leaders of the rebellion succeeded in persuading\r\nthe Southern masses that the success of the Republican party would\r\neventually liberate the slave and place him on an equality with the\r\nwhites, an irresistible impulse was given to their cause. To the extent\r\nthat this charge was credited was the rebellion consolidated and\r\nembittered. Had it been universally believed, there would have been few\r\ndissenting voices throughout the seceding States. All would have rushed\r\nheadlong into the rebellion. And even now, every measure adopted on our\r\npart, in the field or in Congress, which can be distorted as looking to\r\na similar end, must prove to be a strong stimulus in sustaining and\r\ninvigorating the enemy. Happily, while the system of slavery naturally\r\ndiscourages education, and leaves the mass of whites comparatively\r\nuninformed, and peculiarly subject to be deceived and misled, there are\r\nyet many highly intelligent men among the non-slaveholders, and some\r\nliberal and unprejudiced ones among the slaveholders themselves. These\r\nserve to break the force of the appeals made to the ignorant, and they\r\nhave had a powerful influence in maintaining the love of the Union and\r\nthe true spirit of our institutions, among considerable numbers, in all\r\nparts of the South.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing views, it is plain, that only in a certain sense can\r\nslavery be pronounced the cause of the rebellion. It was not the first\r\nand original motive; neither is it the sole end of the conspirators. But\r\nin another sense, it may justly be considered the cause of the war; for\r\nwithout it, the war could never have taken place.\r\n\r\nThere was no actual necessity to destroy the Union for the protection of\r\nslavery and for its continued existence. Construed in any rational sense\r\nlikely to be adopted, the Constitution afforded ample security--far\r\nmore, indeed, than could be found under a separate confederacy. This was\r\nevident to the leaders of the rebellion, though it was their policy to\r\nconceal the truth from the people, by the fierce passions artfully\r\naroused in the beginning. Slavery could not have been perpetuated,\r\nbecause its permanence is against the decrees of nature. But it could\r\nhave lived out a peaceful and perhaps a prosperous existence, gradually\r\ndisappearing without convulsion or bloodshed. Discussion and agitation\r\ncould not have been prevented, nor could the inevitable end have been\r\naverted. Yet the whole movement could well have been controlled and\r\ndirected, by the adoption of wise and well-considered measures, not\r\ninconsistent with the natural laws governing the case, whose final\r\noperation it was wholly impossible to prevent.\r\n\r\nBut this system of gradual amelioration, and peaceful development of\r\nends that must come, did not satisfy the ambition of the conspirators.\r\nThey saw their last opportunity for a successful rebellion, and they\r\ndetermined not to let it pass unimproved. The vast power of the slave\r\ninterest; the passions easily to be excited by it; the encouraging\r\ndelusions clustering around it; and the fearful apprehensions growing\r\nout of its darker aspects, all contributed to make it the very\r\ninstrument for accomplishing the long-cherished design.\r\n\r\nSlavery has been the chief means of bringing about the rebellion. It is\r\nthe lever, resting upon the fulcrum of State sovereignty, by which the\r\nconspirators have been able, temporarily, to force one section of the\r\nUnion from its legitimate connections. Thus used for this unhallowed\r\npurpose, and become tainted with treason and crimsoned with the blood of\r\nslaughtered citizens, slavery necessarily subjects itself to all the\r\nfearful contingencies and responsibilities of the rebellion. Whether the\r\nconfederate cause shall succeed or fail, the slave institution, thus\r\nfatally involved in it, cannot long survive. In either event, its doom\r\nis fixed. Like one of those reptiles, which, in the supreme act of\r\nhostility, extinguish their own lives inflicting a mortal wound upon\r\ntheir victims, slavery, roused to the final paroxysm of its hate and\r\nrage, injects all its venom into the veins of the Union, exhausts itself\r\nin the effort, and inevitably dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORD-MURDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe time has come when we must have an entirely new lot\r\nof superlatives--intensifiers of meaning--verifiers of\r\nearnestness--asserters of exactness, etc., etc. The old ones are as dead\r\nas herrings; killed off, too, as herrings are, by being taken from their\r\nnatural element. What between passionate men and affected women, all the\r\nold stand-bys are used up, and the only practical question is, Where are\r\nthe substitutes to come from? Who shall be trusted to invent them? Not\r\nthe linguists: they would make them too long and slim. Not the mob: they\r\nwould make them too short and stout.\r\n\r\nThere are plenty of words made; but in these times they are all nouns,\r\nand what we want are adverbs--'words that qualify verbs, participles,\r\nadjectives, and other adverbs.' We could get along well enough with the\r\nold adjectives, badly as the superlative degree of some of them has been\r\nused. They are capable of being qualified when they become too weak--or,\r\nrather, when our taste becomes too strong--just as old ladies _qualify_\r\ntheir tea when they begin to find the old excitement insufficient. But\r\neven this must be done with reason, or we shall soon find with the new\r\nsupply, as we are now finding with the old, that the bottle gives out\r\nbefore the tea-caddy. The whole language is sufficient, except in the\r\n_excessives_--the _ultimates_.\r\n\r\nWhy use up the sublime to express the ridiculous? Why be only noticeable\r\nfrom the force of your language as compared with the feebleness of what\r\nyou have to say? Why chain Pegasus to an ox cart, or make your\r\nValenciennes lace into horse blankets? If the noble tools did the\r\nignoble work any better, it might be some satisfaction; but cutting\r\nblocks with a razor is proverbially unprofitable, and a\r\nmillion-magnifying microscope does not help a bit to tell the time by\r\nthe City Hall clock. And again: the beggar doth but make his mishaps the\r\nmore conspicuous by climbing a tree, while the poor bird of paradise,\r\nwhen once fairly on the ground, must needs stay and die, being kept from\r\nrising into her more natural element by the very weight of her beauties.\r\nLike this last-named victim of misdirected ambition, poetical\r\nexpressions, being once fairly reduced to the level of ordinary use, so\r\nthat all feel at liberty to take them in vain, can never 'revocare\r\ngradem.'\r\n\r\nThe elegant, however, is not so much of a loss, as the strong and\r\nserviceable part of the language;--which, so far, is like grain in a\r\nhopper, always being added to at the top, and ground away at the bottom.\r\nThe good old unmistakable words seem to sink the faster from their\r\ngreater specific gravity compared to the chaff that surrounds them; for\r\nexample: _Indeed_ used to be a fine and reliable word for impressing an\r\nassertion, but now it is almost discarded except as a sort of\r\nquestioning expression of surprise, which might advantageously be\r\nshortened thus:?! Strictly interpreted, it denotes a lack of faith,\r\nsuggesting a possible discrepancy between the words of the speaker and\r\nthe deeds they relate to. It is but one step removed from the politeness\r\nof the Sligo Irishwomen, who say, 'You are a liar,' meaning exactly\r\nwhat an American lady does in saying 'You don't mean so!'\r\n\r\nI suppose it seemed as if the force of language could no further go,\r\nwhen men first said _really_. \"What is more indisputable than reality?\r\nBut it has come to be a sort of vulcanizer, to make plain English,\r\nirony. Nowadays, when a young lady adds, 'really,' one may know that she\r\nmeans to cast a doubt over the seriousness of what she says, or to\r\nmoderate its significance. 'Really, sir, you must not talk so,' is the\r\nappropriate form for a tone of decided encouragement to continue your\r\nremarks--probably complimentary to herself, or the opposite to some\r\nfriend. And so we might go on down, taking every word of the sort from\r\nthe dictionary, and comparing its usefulness now, with that of the time\r\nwhen it had no ambiguity.\r\n\r\n_Positively_, _seriously_, _perfectly_, and their synonymes, have been\r\nsubtracted, one after another, from our list of absolute words,--Burked,\r\ncarried off, and consumed, by people who, if they had each had the\r\nfinishing off of one word, instead of each doing a part at the ruin of\r\nall, would deserve to have their names handed down to posterity in\r\nconnection with the ruin they had wrought, as much as ever Erostratus or\r\nMartin did; the former, we all know, was he of whom it is said:\r\n\r\n  'The ambitious youth who fired th' Ephesian dome\r\n  Outlives in fame the pious fool that reared it.'\r\n\r\nThe latter, it is not so well known, did likewise by Yorkminster, for a\r\nsimilar purpose, and is now, as Mrs. Partington would say, 'Expatiating\r\nhis offence' in a lunatic asylum. But their name is legion. How many a\r\nman, perhaps, 'father of a family, member of the church, and doing a\r\nsnug business,' hears every day or two 'positively and without joking or\r\nexaggeration, the most perfectly absurd and ridiculous thing, he ever\r\nheard in all his born days!'\r\n\r\n_Actually_ was a nice word. We suffered a loss when it died, and it\r\ndeserves this obituary notice. It was a pretty word to speak and to\r\nwrite, and there was a crisp exactness about its very sound that gave it\r\nmeaning. _Requiescat in pace._ But last and most to be lamented, comes\r\n_literally_. I could be pathetic about that word. So classic--so\r\nperfect--it crystallized the asseveration honored with its assistance.\r\nAnd so early dead! Cut off untimely in the green freshness of its\r\ndays--and I have not even the Homeric satisfaction of burying it! It\r\nstill wanders in the shades of purgatory, _Vox et præterea nihil_; being\r\nbandied about from mouth to mouth of the profane vulgar. And not even by\r\nthem alone is disrespect offered it, for the grave and practical Mr.\r\nLayard says somewhere in the account of his uncoveries, 'They\r\n_literally_ bathed my shoes with their tears!' _Idem, sed quantum\r\nmutatus ab illo!_ I am almost tempted to the ambiguous wish that he\r\nmight have _slipped in literally_ to one of the many graves he robbed\r\nfiguratively.\r\n\r\nNow listen for a moment to Miss Giggley, who is telling of her\r\ntemptation to laugh at some young unfortunate who thought he was making\r\nhimself very agreeable. 'Really and truly, upon my word and honor, I\r\npositively thought I--should--die: as sure as I'm alive.' You pretty\r\nliar! You smiling murderess! You playful puss, gracefully toying with\r\nthe victims your sweet mouth kills! Those expletives were like five\r\nstrong men standing in a row, and you were like a bright,\r\ninnocent-looking electric machine, with its transparent and clear-voiced\r\ncylinder, which is capable (give it only enough turnings) of making the\r\nmen, at a shock, into five long, prostrate heaps of clay, lifeless,\r\nuseless, and offensive, as are the expletives in question, by reason of\r\na succession of just such shocking assaults as the untruth you this\r\nmoment swore to.\r\n\r\nAnonymous writers, as a class, might be called the Boythorns of\r\nLiterature. All of them, from Junius down, have shown a great\r\nsatisfaction in waving a tremendously sharp sword out from behind a\r\nfence. Sometimes the hand that has held the weapon was strong enough to\r\nhave done good service wherever it might have been engaged, but always\r\nthe wielding is a little more fearless than if the owner's face were\r\nvisible, and usually it is the better for his cause that it was not. We\r\nall know what a _very_ large cannon the monkey touched off, and how, if\r\nany one _had_ been in the way, it might have hurt him very much. As when\r\na traveller writes of a far country, he tries to make it seem worth all\r\nthe trouble he took to go there, so a critic must find enough bad about\r\na book to make his article on it important and interesting.\r\n\r\nThese exaggerators--these _captatores_ (and _occisores_)\r\n_verborum_--have no idea of the adaptation of means to ends. They are\r\nnot deficient in forces--they have a powerful army, but no generalship.\r\nHorse, foot, and artillery; it's all vanguard. Right, left, and\r\ncentre--but all vanguard. At the first glimpse, pioneers and scouts,\r\nrank and file, sappers and miners, sutlers and supernumeraries, all come\r\nthundering down like a thousand of brick, and gleaming in the purple and\r\ngold of imagery, to rout, disperse, and confound their obstacle; even if\r\nit's only a corporal's guard of one private!\r\n\r\nThis _specialité_ in newspapers has occasionally been ridiculed, though\r\nnot very well. Dickens's _Eatonsville Gazette_ and _Independent_ are\r\nperhaps the best caricatures; and they are a very good embodiment of a\r\nparticular class of partisan provincial papers; but they are utterly\r\ninadequate to characterize the exaggeration that runs riot through the\r\nwhole tribe of periodicals--and _amok_ through the serried ranks of\r\nAnglo-Saxon words. See the _New York Rostrum_; daily, weekly, and\r\nsemi-weekly. It is rampant! It suspects an abuse, and it ramps against\r\nit. It seizes an idea, and it ramps toward its development. All who are\r\nnot with it are against it, and all who are against it are either fools\r\nor knaves. The _Rostrum_ never chronicles railroad accidents. Oh, no! It\r\nonly tells its readers of dastardly and cowardly outrages, committed by\r\nblood-thirsty fiends in the shape of presidents and directors against\r\nvirtuous and estimable passengers, whole hecatombs of whom are\r\nassassinated to gratify the hideous appetite for carnage of the\r\nofficials aforesaid; every one of whom, from the president to the\r\nwater-boys, ought to suffer the extremest penalty of the law. It doesn't\r\nsay that they ought to be hung. No! capital punishment was the most\r\nbenighted characteristic of barbarism. It is a horrid atrocity to bring\r\nit down to the present day. Nobody ought to be subjected to it but the\r\nslimy reptiles who advocate its continuance.\r\n\r\nNot only does the _Rostrum_ behave like a wild bull of Bashan when it is\r\nfairly under way, but it is a perfect rocket at starting. It makes haste\r\nto commit itself. It is continually entering into bonds to break the\r\npeace. Its principle is not unlike that of the Irishman in a row:\r\n'Wherever you see a head, hit it.' It deals around little doses of\r\nshillelah, just by way of experiment; and if the unlucky head does not\r\nhappen to be that of an enemy, make it one; so it's all right again. It\r\ncarries whole baskets of chips on its shoulders, knock one off who will.\r\n\r\nForgive me, good _Rostrum_! I honestly believe thee to be the best paper\r\nin this world; and my morning breakfast and car ride would be as fasting\r\nand a pilgrimage, without thee! It takes all my philosophy and more than\r\nall my piety (besides the lying abed late, and the coffee, which we only\r\nhave once a week) to dispense with thee on Sunday. No paper is so\r\nuntrammelled as thou art, for thou hast no shackles but those thou\r\nthrustest thine own wrists into; and I prize thee more than a whole\r\nsheaf of thy compeers, who always try to decide safely by deciding last.\r\nThou art prompt, brave, and straightforward. In nine cases out of ten,\r\nwhen there are two cages open, thou dashest impetuously into the right\r\none. Verily, thou art a little more headstrong than strong-headed, and a\r\nlittle less long-headed than headlong; but I say, rather let me be\r\noccasionally wrong with thee than always mean with some of thy rivals.\r\nBut why be intemperate in thine advocacy of the nigger question, so\r\noverbearing in thine efforts for freedom of speech, or why enslave\r\nthyself in the cause of liberty? I could imagine a paper without even\r\nthy faults--and for this, I know full well that if thou notice me at\r\nall, it will be as a besotted and dangerous old fogy.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the _Rostrum_ might be found guilty on other counts of the\r\ngeneral crime of word-murder. It has done for the word _height_ by\r\nspelling it _hight_, at the same time giving a supererogatory kick to\r\nthe good old English participle (already deceased) of the latter\r\northography. And then, it is not always quite certain whether its events\r\noccurred or _transpired_! The misapplication of this last word is a\r\nshocking abuse of our defenceless mother tongue, and one I have not\r\noften seen publicly rebuked. It is not long since I saw the poor\r\ndissyllable in question evidently misapplied in the dedication of a\r\nbook, and on Sunday, not long ago, I heard the pastor of one of the\r\nfirst churches in the city preach of the power directing the events\r\nwhich _transpire_ in this world!\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of getting public duties attended to; one of which is\r\nto advertise for proposals,--a very expensive way; and the other is to\r\nget up a public meeting or association, when all men think it an honor\r\nto be elected officers for the sake of seeing their names in the papers.\r\nNow this last way is the best, in so many respects that it shall be\r\nadopted without hesitation for our purposes. Let there be a new Humane\r\nSociety established, principally for the prevention of cruelty to words,\r\nand let the chief officer of the society be so named as to suggest its\r\nchief office--that of 'moderator.' And let us hope that as words are the\r\nthings in question, deeds will abound, as we so well know the truth of\r\nthe reverse, that where deeds are to be looked for, words prevail\r\namazingly. Outside of its primary beneficent purpose, it may make\r\nprovision for charities incidental thereunto. It may appoint one\r\ncommittee for the prevention of cruelty to compositors, to examine the\r\nchirography of all MSS. about to be 'put in hand,' and, in any case it\r\nthinks necessary, return mercilessly the whole scrawled mass to the\r\nauthor to have t's crossed, i's dotted, a's and o's joined at the top,\r\netc., etc. Another privileged three may be merciful to the authors\r\nthemselves, by providing for the better reading of proofs, by examining\r\nand qualifying the readers thereof; a class in this country very\r\ndeficient, and for a happy reason: namely, that we have not yet a\r\nmultitude of literary men, very well educated and very poor, who can\r\nfind nothing better to do. This last committee would find comparatively\r\nlittle occupation, when the previous one had become effective in _its_\r\nline.\r\n\r\nTo what an illimitable enterprise does the vastness of our plans lead\r\nus! Long vistas open before our eyes, with fine prospects for patronage\r\nand the gift of many offices. It is at least equal in dignity and\r\ngrandeur to the city government, and nothing prevents its becoming a\r\nvast scheme of corruption, except that it never can, by any possibility,\r\npossess a penny of revenue. Of course there should be a committee of\r\nrepairs and supplies, and one of immigration, the latter to provide for\r\nthe naturalization of foreign words and their proper treatment before\r\nthey could take care of themselves; the former for furnishing a supply\r\nto meet the growing demand mentioned at the beginning of this article,\r\nand for patching up several of the most obvious imperfections we now\r\nsuffer from. We want a word for _the opposite of a compliment_. Not that\r\nthis is as great a defect as the lack of the word _compliment_ would be\r\nin these smooth-spoken times, but still the want is felt, and the\r\nfeeling is shown by such awkward expedients as the expression 'a\r\nleft-handed compliment.' Then, besides, they might give the seal of\r\nlegitimacy to a fine lot of words and phrases, the need of which is\r\nshown by their being spontaneously invented, and universally adopted by\r\nthe vulgar; but which are not classic, have never been written except in\r\ncaricature, and are therefore inadmissible to the writings of us\r\ncowardly fellows who 'do' the current literature. For instance: the word\r\n_onto_, to bear the same relation to _on_ and _upon_, that the word\r\n_into_ does to _in_ and _within_, has no synonyme, and if we had once\r\nadopted it, we should be surprised at our own self-denial in having had\r\nit so long in our ears without taking it for the use of our mouths and\r\npens.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary department should have full power to try _all_ defilers of\r\nthe well of English, be they these offenders we have been talking\r\nof--spendthrifts and drunkards in the use of its strong waters--or be\r\nthey punsters, or be they the latest development of miscreants, the\r\n_transposers_. To the punsters shall be adjudged a perpetual strabismus,\r\nthat they may look two ways at once, forever--always seeing double with\r\ntheir bodily eyes, as they have been in the habit of doing with their\r\nmental ones. Even so to the transposer. Let him be inverted, and hung by\r\nthe heels till _healed_ of his disorder.\r\n\r\nIf this idea of an association is seized upon, I should be happy to\r\nsuggest well-qualified persons for all the offices _except_ the highest.\r\nThe most appropriate incumbent for that, modesty forbids my mentioning.\r\nBut the matter must not be let drop. Unless there can be some check put\r\nto the present extravagance, we shall all take to _swearing_, for I am\r\nsure that is the first step beyond it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWART, AND THE DRY GOODS TRADE OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have watched the growth of New York, have found a striking\r\ncriterion of its gradual advance in the different aspects of the dry\r\ngoods trade. We select this branch of business as a better illustration\r\nof the progress of our metropolis than any other, since in breadth, as\r\nwell as in enterprise, it has always taken the lead. What grocer,\r\nhardwareman, druggist, or any other of the different tradesmen of the\r\nmetropolis, ever wrought out of nothing the majestic structures or the\r\nenormous traffic which is represented by some of our dry goods concerns.\r\n\r\nDry goods originally held their headquarters between Wall street and\r\nCoenties slip. In those days Front street for grocers, and Pearl for dry\r\ngoods men, within the limits above mentioned, sufficed for all the\r\ndemands of trade, and in many instances the jobber lived in the upper\r\npart of his store. The great fire of 1835 put an end to all that was\r\nleft of these primitive manners, and the burnt district was in due time\r\ncovered with new brick stores, of a style vastly superior to those of\r\nthe past. At the same time the advance in the price of lots fully made\r\nup the loss of insurance on buildings which was inevitable from the\r\nuniversal bankruptcy of fire offices. As trade appeared to be firmly\r\nestablished in that section, a mammoth hotel was built near Coenties\r\nslip for the accommodation of country merchants, and was long famous as\r\nthe 'Pearl Street House.' A jobbing concern at that day might be\r\nsatisfied with the first floor and basement of a building twenty-five\r\nfeet by sixty to eighty, in which a business of from one hundred\r\nthousand to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars could be done. Such\r\na business was then thought of respectable amount, and few exceeded it.\r\n\r\nThe trade even at that early day was remarkable for its\r\nprecariousness--and while a few made fortunes, whole ranks were swept\r\naway by occasional panics. In 1840, Hanover square was the dry goods\r\nemporium of New York, and there a few years earlier Eno & Phelps\r\ncommenced a thriving trade which grew into famous proportions. As an\r\nillustration of the risks of trade, we may mention that we know of no\r\nother concern engaged in that vicinity at that time which escaped\r\neventual bankruptcy. Near Eno & Phelps stood the granite establishment\r\nof Arthur Tappan & Co., while lesser concerns were crowded in close\r\nproximity. The first disposition to abandon this section was shown by\r\nopening new stores in Cedar street, which soon became so popular as a\r\njobbing resort that its rents quadrupled. The Cedar street jobbers would\r\nin the present day be considered mere Liliputians, since many of their\r\nstores measured less than eighteen by thirty feet. They were occupied by\r\na class of active men, who bought of importers and sold to country\r\ndealers on the principle of the nimble sixpence. Of this class (now\r\nabout extinct) a few built up large concerns, while others, after\r\nhopelessly contending year after year with adverse fortune, sunk\r\neventually into bankruptcy, and may in some instances now be found in\r\nthe ranks of clerkship. From Cedar street, trade moved to Liberty,\r\nNassau, and John streets, while as these new emporiums prospered, Pearl\r\nstreet gradually lost its prestige, until the general hegira of trade in\r\n1848, which left that ancient mart deserted. The Pearl street hotel,\r\nwhich once was thronged by country dealers and city drummers, was then\r\naltered into a warehouse for storage, while the jobbing houses, where\r\nmerchants were wont to congregate, fell into baser uses, and property\r\nsunk in value correspondingly.\r\n\r\nThe 'hegira,' to which we have referred, led from the east to the north\r\nside of the town, and was so exacting in its demands, that at length no\r\nman could hope to sell goods except in the new locality. Meanwhile,\r\nproperty in Cortlandt, Dey, Vesey, and the neighboring streets, rose\r\nimmensely, and old rookeries were replaced by elegant stores. The chief\r\nfeatures in this improvement were increased size and enlarged room. L.O.\r\nWilson & Co. took the lead in this by opening a store extending through\r\nfrom Cortlandt to Dey street, whose spacious hall could have swallowed\r\nup a half dozen old fashioned Pearl street concerns.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Wilson's ambition to break the bondage of antiquated habit,\r\nand inaugurate a revolution in trade. He had been a prominent Pearl\r\nstreet man, and had retired with a snug fortune, but had too active a\r\nmind to be satisfied with the quiet of retired life, and hence returned\r\nto trade with renewed energy. The new concern created a decided\r\nsensation, and for several years was successful, but we regret that we\r\ncannot record for it any other end than that which is the general fate\r\nof New York merchants. The movement which had now been inaugurated,\r\ncontinued with rapid progress until Barclay, Warren, Murray, and\r\nChambers streets were transformed from quiet abodes of wealthy citizens\r\nto bustling avenues of trade. With this change the demand for size and\r\nornament still continued, and was accompanied by enormous increase in\r\nrents. A newly-built Pearl street jobbing house in 1836 might be worth\r\n$1,500 per annum, while $3,000 was considered enormous; but now rents\r\nadvanced to rates, which, compared with these, seemed fabulous. To meet\r\nthese expenses, the consolidation of firms was resorted to, and the\r\nstandard of a good year's trade extended from $250,000 to a million and\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nFrom 1848 to 1860 the principle of extension was in active operation.\r\nFrom Chambers street the work of renovation progressed upward, until\r\neven Canal street was invaded by jobbers, and until a space of a half\r\nmile square had been entirely torn down and rebuilt. Vast fortunes were\r\nmade in the twinkling of an eye. A German grocer, who held a lease of\r\nthe corner of Warren and Church streets, received $10,000 for two years\r\nof unexpired lease. The fellow found that the property was needed for\r\nthe improvement of adjacent lots, and made a bold and successful strike\r\nfor a premium. The church property, corner of Duane and Church streets,\r\none hundred feet square, was sold for $28,000, and within a week resold\r\nto a builder for $48,000. The widening of streets now became popular,\r\nand a spot long famed for the degradation of its inhabitants, was thrown\r\nopen to the activities of trade, and its rookeries replaced by marble\r\npalaces. What a transformation for Reade, Duane, Church, and Anthony\r\nstreets, once synonymous with misery and crime, thus to become the\r\nsplendid seats of trade!\r\n\r\nThe growth of the dry goods trade had by 1860 assumed proportions which\r\ntwenty years previously could not have entered into the wildest dreams.\r\nIndeed, had a prophet stood in Hanover square at that epoch, and\r\nportrayed the future, he would have been met with the charge of lunacy.\r\n$30,000 rent for a store was not more absurd than the idea that trade\r\nwould ever wing its way to a neighborhood chiefly known through the\r\npolice reports, and only visited by respectable people in the work of\r\nphilanthropy. The enterprise of New York houses, in either following or\r\nleading this movement, is admirably illustrated, and as the merchants of\r\nNew York are among her public men, we purpose a brief reference to a few\r\nleading houses. As it is nothing new to state that only three per cent.\r\nof our mercantile community are successful in making fortunes, the\r\nresults of these examples need not surprise the reader.\r\n\r\nAmong the chief concerns of nearly forty years' career, may be mentioned\r\nC.W. & J.T. Moore & Co., who began in a small way in Pearl street,\r\nfollowed the flood of trade to Broadway, and afterward took possession\r\nof the splendid store built by James E. Whiting, on the site of the\r\nBroadway theatre. Bowen & McNamee commenced somewhere about 1840, having\r\nsprung from the bankrupt house of Arthur Tappan & Co. Their first\r\nestablishment was in Beaver street, whence they removed to a marble\r\npalace which they built in Broadway in 1850, having, in ten years,\r\nrealized an enormous fortune in the silk trade. Encouraged by the\r\nsuccess following this second movement, the firm sold their store at an\r\nenormous advance, and purchased the corner of Broadway and Pearl\r\nstreets, thus indicating that trade had advanced a mile up town. The\r\npalatial store which they erected on this spot will long mark the\r\nclimacteric point in mercantile architecture. It was supposed at the\r\ntime of its erection to be the finest jobbing store in existence, and\r\nalthough since then both Mr. Astor and James E. Whiting have each put up\r\na splendid marble establishment in Broadway, they have not surpassed the\r\none we refer to. Messrs. Bowen & McNamee were early identified with the\r\nprogressive views of New England politics, which they maintained\r\nthroughout their business career. At an early day a system of\r\npersecution was opened upon them by a portion of the New York press on\r\nthe score of their anti-slavery sentiments, to which they replied by\r\nannouncing that 'they had goods for sale, not opinions.' This bold\r\nexpression became quite popular in its day, and did much to extend the\r\nbusiness of the high-toned concern which proclaimed it, so that what was\r\nlost by prejudice was more than gained from legions of new friends,\r\nuntil, for a time, they reaped a golden harvest from a trade which\r\nramified to all parts of the North, East, and West.\r\n\r\nAnother famous concern which sustained a position diametrically\r\nopposite to the one we have just mentioned, was that of Henrys, Smith &\r\nTownsend. This house was for more than a quarter of a century\r\ndistinguished in the dry goods line, but held a Southern trade, and its\r\nmembers were men of corresponding proclivities. Commencing in Hanover\r\nsquare, the firm had followed the drift of trade into Broadway, and had\r\nbecome immensely rich. Like Bowen & McNamee (or Bowen, Holmes & Co.,\r\ntheir later firm), they led in political, as well as in mercantile\r\nenterprise, and these two houses, like Calpe and Abyla, were for years\r\nset over against each other as the trade representatives of the Northern\r\nand Southern sentiment.\r\n\r\nYet, whatever may have been their difference of opinion, we are well\r\npersuaded of the fact that both houses were composed of patriotic and\r\nhigh-minded men, who differed simply because their views were of an\r\nextreme character. We might record other distinguished firms, which like\r\nthese arose to greatness from humble beginnings, and at last fell like\r\nthem beneath the revulsion which preceded the present civil war; but\r\nthese will serve as general illustrations.\r\n\r\nWith this revulsion the glory of the great houses has passed away. The\r\nmarble palaces which formerly rented for $20,000 to $50,000, either\r\nstand empty or are tenanted at a nominal rate; and the enormous traffic\r\nof millions annually, has sunk down to the proportions of primitive\r\ntimes. Those grand Broadway stores must hereafter be divided, for no one\r\nconcern can fill them, and the dreams of merchant and of builder are\r\nalike exploded. The dry goods trade in New York is now under a process\r\nof change, and as the dispensation of high rents and broad floors, long\r\ncredits and enormous sales, seems to be passing away, it is a question\r\nof no small interest what shape the trade will put on. We will not\r\nattempt to answer that question. We prefer to give a sketch of the man\r\nwho has done the most to solve it--Mr. A. T. Stewart.\r\n\r\nMr. Stewart possesses one of the most truly executive minds in America.\r\nIndeed, as respects this feature, we doubt if any exception could be\r\nmade to according him the very first position among our business men.\r\nOthers may occasionally equal him in grasp of intellect, as in the\r\ninstance of George Law, or Cornelius Vanderbilt; but, considered in the\r\npoint of executive ability, we consider him unapproachable. He has long\r\nbeen chief among American dry goods dealers, and is known far and wide\r\nas the largest merchant (that is, buyer and seller) on this continent,\r\nand perhaps in the world. Yet there are thousands, including New Yorkers\r\nas well as country people, who have lost sight of Mr. Stewart's\r\npersonality, and mention his name daily, and, perhaps, hourly, merely as\r\nthe representative of a mammoth house of trade. The reason of this is\r\nobvious: hundreds and thousands have dealt year after year in that\r\nmarble palace without ever beholding its proprietor. To such persons the\r\nname 'Stewart' has become merely a symbol, or, at most, a term of\r\nlocality. To them he is a myth, with no personal entity. To their minds\r\nthe term sets forth, instead of so many feet stature encased in\r\nbroadcloth, with countenance, character, and voice like other men,\r\nmerely a train of ideas, a marble front, plate glass, gorgeous drapery,\r\nlegion of clerks, paradise of fashion, crowds of customers, and all the\r\nfascination of a day of shopping. 'Where did you get that love of a\r\nshawl?' asks Miss Matilda Namby Pamby of her friend Miss Araminta\r\nVacuum. 'Why, at Stewart's, of course,' is the inevitable reply; 'and so\r\ncheap! only $250.' Now, to this pair of lady economists, what is\r\n'Stewart's' but a mere locality, as impersonal as Paris or Brussels, or\r\nany other mart of finery? We would correct this tendency to the unreal\r\n(which, by the way, is very natural), by stating that behind the mythic\r\nidea, there _is_ a Stewart; not a mere locality, but a man--plain,\r\nearnest, and industrious--who, amid this army of clerks and bustle of\r\nexternal traffic, drives the secret machinery with wonderful precision.\r\nPurchasers at retail are the most liable to the symbolic idea, since\r\nthey never behold the existing Stewart. They see hundreds of salesmen,\r\nsome stout and some thin, some long and some short, some florid and some\r\npale, moving about in broadcloth, with varied port of dignity and\r\nimportance, who may look as if they would like to own a palace. Yet\r\namong these the proprietor will be sought in vain. But if one ascends to\r\nthe second story, he will find himself in a new world. This is the\r\nwholesale establishment, and here Mr. Stewart appears as the presiding\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nAs one enters this department he may observe, in a large office on the\r\nside of the house looking into Chambers street, the grandmaster of the\r\nmammoth establishment, sitting at the desk, and occupied by the pressing\r\ndemands of so important a position. Here, from eight in the morning\r\nuntil a late dinner hour, he is engrossed by the schemes and plans of\r\nhis active brain. He bears a calm and thoughtful appearance, and yet,\r\nsuch is his executive ability, that the burden which would crush others\r\nis borne by him with comparative ease. His aspect and manners are plain\r\nand simple to a remarkable degree, and a stranger would be surprised to\r\nacknowledge in that tall form and quiet countenance, the Autocrat of the\r\nDry Goods Trade. This man did not achieve this position save by patient\r\ntoil; his greatness was not 'thrust upon him.' It has arisen from forty\r\nyears of close application to the branch of trade which he adopted in\r\nearly life, and to which he has bent his rare powers of mind. Like most\r\nof our successful men, he began the world with no capital beside brains;\r\nand like Daniel Webster and Louis Philippe, his early employment was\r\nteaching. The instructor, however, was soon merged in the business man,\r\nand in 1827 his unpretending name was displayed in Broadway, The little\r\nconcern in which he then was salesman, buyer, financier, and sole\r\nmanager, has gradually increased in importance, until it has become the\r\npresent marble palace. It is probable that much of his early prosperity\r\nwas owing to a remarkably fine taste in the selection of dress goods;\r\nbut the subsequent breadth of his operations and their splendid success\r\nmay be ascribed to his love of order, and its influence upon his\r\noperations. Years of practice upon this idea have enabled him to reduce\r\neverything to a system. Beside this, he is a first-class judge of\r\ncharacter, reads men and schemes at a glance, and continually exhibits a\r\ndepth of penetration which astonishes all who witness it. Thus, although\r\nsitting alone in his office, he is apparently conscious of whatever is\r\ngoing on in all parts of his establishment. So completely is he _en\r\nrapport_ with matters on the different floors, that the clerks sometimes\r\nimagine that there must be an invisible telegraph girdling the huge\r\nbuilding. These men often say, by way of pleasant illustration of this\r\nfact, that if any one of them is absent, he is the very man to be first\r\ncalled for. From this it may be understood that it is not an easy matter\r\nto vary from the rigid system which holds its alternative of diligence\r\nor discharge over all beneath its control. We have referred to Mr.\r\nStewart's habits of order as a means by which he controls his vast\r\nbusiness with apparent ease. To explain this more explicitly, we may\r\nstate that each department or branch of trade is under a distinct\r\nmanager. These wholesale departments have been increased every year,\r\nuntil there is hardly an item in the comprehensive variety of the dry\r\ngoods trade that is not here to be found. The advantage of this\r\nprogressive movement was lately shown by the fact that, while Mr.\r\nStewart lost enormous sums by Southern repudiation, he made up a large\r\nportion of the loss by the recent advance in domestics, a department\r\nwhich he had just added to his stock. The numerous failures which take\r\nplace among New York business men give Mr. Stewart the choice among\r\nthem for his managers, and a representation of the finest business\r\ntalent of the city can, at this moment, be found in his establishment.\r\nThese men turn their energies into that mighty channel which flows into\r\nhis treasury. Indeed, to this merchant prince, they are what his\r\nmarshals were to Napoleon, and, like him, this Autocrat of Trade sits\r\nenthroned in the insulated majesty of mercantile greatness.\r\n\r\nIt may be inferred that no man in the concern works harder than its\r\nowner, and we believe that this is acknowledged by all its employés. Day\r\nafter day he wears the harness of silent and patient toil.\r\n\r\nIt is not generally known that during these hours of application, and\r\nwhile engrossed in the management of his immense operations, no one is\r\nallowed to address him personally until his errand or business shall\r\nhave been first laid before a subordinate. If it is of such a character\r\nthat that gentleman can attend to it, it goes no farther, and hence it\r\nvests with him to communicate it to his principal. To illustrate this\r\ncircumstance, we relate the following incident: A few weeks ago a person\r\nentered the wholesale department, with an air of great importance, and\r\ndemanded to see the proprietor. That proprietor could very easily be\r\nseen, as he was sitting in his office, but the stranger was courteously\r\nmet by the assistant, with the usual inquiry as to the nature of his\r\nbusiness. The stranger, who was a Government man, bristled up and\r\nexclaimed, indignantly, 'Sir, I come from Mr. Lincoln, and shall tell my\r\nbusiness to no one but Mr. Stewart.' 'Sir,' replied the inevitable Mr.\r\nBrown, 'if Mr. Lincoln himself were to come here, he would not see Mr.\r\nStewart until he should have first told me his business.'\r\n\r\nThe amount of annual sales made at this establishment is not known\r\noutside of the circle of managers, but may be variously estimated at\r\nfrom ten to thirty millions. This includes the retail department, whose\r\ndaily trade varies, according to weather and season, from three thousand\r\nto twelve thousand dollars per day. To supply this vast demand for\r\ngoods, Mr. Stewart has agencies in Paris, London, Manchester, Belfast,\r\nLyons, and other European marts. Two of the above cities are the\r\npermanent residences of his partners; and while Mr. Fox represents the\r\nhouse in Manchester, Mr. Warton occupies the same position in Paris.\r\nThese gentlemen are the only partners of the great house of A.T. Stewart\r\n& Co.\r\n\r\nThe marble block which the firm now occupies was built nearly twenty\r\nyears ago. It had been the site of an old-fashioned hotel--which, like\r\nmany others of its class, bore the name of 'Washington,' and which was\r\neventually destroyed by fire. Mr. Stewart bought the plot at auction for\r\nless than $70,000, a sum which now would be considered beneath half its\r\nvalue. To this was subsequently added adjacent lots in Broadway, Reade\r\nand Chambers streets, and the present magnificent pile reared. To such\r\nof our readers as walk Broadway, we need not add any detail of its\r\ndimensions, nor mention what is now well known, that, large as it is, it\r\nis still too small for the increasing business. Hence another mercantile\r\npalace has been erected by Mr. Stewart in Broadway near Tenth street.\r\nThis is intended for the retail trade, and is, no doubt, the most\r\nconvenient, as well as the most splendid structure of the kind in the\r\nworld. After the retail department shall have been thus removed up town\r\nthe present store will be devoted to the wholesale trade.\r\n\r\nIf any of our readers should inquire what impulse moves the energies of\r\none whose circumstances might warrant a life of ease, we presume that\r\nthe reply would be force of character and the strength of habit. Mr.\r\nStewart has an empire in the world of merchandise which he can neither\r\nbe expected to resign or abdicate. We cannot regret that law of\r\ncentralization which builds up one marble palace, where hundreds have\r\nfailed utterly to make a living. Centralization of trade has its\r\nobjections, and yet, upon the whole, there is, no doubt, a much\r\nhealthier and happier condition prevailing among the parties connected\r\nwith Mr. Stewart, than would be found among the struggling concerns (say\r\nfifty or more) whose place he has taken. Centralization is a law in\r\ntrade whose movement crushes the weak by an inevitable step, while, by\r\ncompelling them to take refuge beneath the protection of the strong it\r\naffords a better condition than the one from which they have been\r\ndriven. To his early perception of this law Mr. Stewart largely owes his\r\npresent colossal fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNHEEDED GROWTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n  As on the top of Lebanon,\r\n    Slowly the Temple grew,\r\n  All unobserved, though every shaft\r\n    A giant shadow threw:\r\n\r\n  Unheeded, though the golden pomp\r\n    Of ponderous roof and spire,\r\n  Wrought in the chambers of the earth,\r\n    Like subterranean fire:\r\n\r\n  Until the huge translated pile,\r\n    By brother kings upreared,\r\n  On Zion's hill, enthroned at last,\r\n    In silence reappeared.\r\n\r\n  So, not with observation comes\r\n    God's kingdom in the heart;\r\n  But like that Temple, silently,\r\n    With golden doors apart.\r\n\r\n  And all the Mighty Ones that watch,\r\n    With folded wings above,\r\n  Trembling with awe, now stoop to earth,\r\n    On messages of love.\r\n\r\n  Another Temple riseth fast,\r\n    Unbuilt of mortal hands,\r\n  Upheaving to the battle-blast\r\n    Of Freedom's conquering bands!\r\n\r\n  The bannered host--the darkened skies--\r\n    The thunderings all about,\r\n  Foreshadow but a Nation's birth,\r\n    Answering a Nation's shout!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED, YELLOW, AND BLUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlas for the old fashions! Wonder, incredulity, curiosity, and a crowd\r\nof primitive sensations, the whooping host that greeted, like misformed\r\nbrutes on Circean shores, the steamboat and the telegraph, are passing\r\naway on a Lethean tide, and our mysteries are departing from among us.\r\nThe intelligence which so long gazed wistfully upon the barred door of\r\nnature, or picked unsuccessfully at the bolts, with skeleton theories,\r\nand vague speculations, had learned to try the 'open sesame' of science.\r\nThe master key is turning, the shafts yield, and already a dim glory\r\nshines through.\r\n\r\nWhile the strides of a positive philosophy are crippled by enthusiastic\r\nrhapsodies about intuition and instinct, her footsteps are still\r\nindelible, and her progress is certain and accelerating. Reason is\r\nwritten on her brow; she appeals to the universal gift, and denies the\r\nauthoritative dictations of fallible genius, as much as a moral equality\r\ndisallows the divine right of kings. Speculators among stars,\r\nspeculators among sounds and colors, are the skirmishers in front of an\r\nintellectual post, whose tread reverberates but little in their rear.\r\nAccoutred with a few empiric facts and inductive minds, they aspire to\r\nbeautiful and stable theories, whence they may descend, by deductive\r\nsteps, accurate even to mathematical absoluteness, to the very arcana of\r\nwhat has been the inexplicable. To them the true, the beautiful, must be\r\nfacts, defined, realized, and vigorously analyzed. Visible embodiments\r\nof an incomprehensible grace must be disintegrated, and the thinnest\r\nessences escape not the analytical rack whereon they confess the causal\r\nentity of their composition. 'Broad-browed genius' may toss his locks in\r\nthe studio redolent of art; his eye may light, and his nervous fingers\r\nprint the grand creation on the canvas. The divine afflatus is in his\r\nnostrils; it is his spirit, and his picture is the reflex of his soul.\r\nBut keen-eyed Science lays a shadowy hand upon the 'holy coloring,' and\r\nsays: 'Truly, the harmony is beautiful; it has pleased a sympathetic\r\ninstinct from the first. Yet, from the first, my laws have been upon\r\nit--inexorable laws, which answer to the mind as instinct echoes to the\r\nsoul.'\r\n\r\nThe august simile of the philosopher, who likened the world to a vast\r\nanimal, is appearing each day as too real for poetry. The ocean lungs\r\npulse a gigantic breath at every tide, her continental limbs vibrate\r\nwith light and electricity, her Cyclopean fires burn within, and her\r\natmosphere, ever giving, ever receiving, subserves the stupendous\r\nequilibrium, and betrays the universal motion. Motion is material life;\r\nfrom the molecular quiverings in the crystal diamond, to the light\r\nvibrations of a meridian sun--from the half-smothered sound of a\r\nwhispered love, to the whirl of the uttermost orb in space, there is\r\nlife in moving matter, as perfect in particulars, and as magnificent in\r\nrange, as the animation which swells the tiny lung of the polyp, or\r\nvitalizes the uncouth python floundering in the saurian slime of a\r\nhalf-cooled planet.\r\n\r\nWhen a polar continent heaves from the bosom of the deep, or when the\r\ninquiring eye rests upon the serrated rock, the antique victim of some\r\ndrift-dispersing glacier, the mind perceives the effects and recognizes\r\nthe existence of nature's omnipotent muscles, and their appalling power.\r\n\r\nBut that adventurer who chases the chain of necessity to the sources of\r\nthis grand instability, is merged at once in a haze of speculations,\r\nbeautiful as sunlight through morning mists, but uncertain as the\r\nveriest chimeras. While beyond the idea of comprehensive motion the\r\ncolossal symmetry of Truth expands in ultimate outlines, her features\r\nare shrouded, but in such an attractive clare-obscure of inviting\r\nanalogies and semi-satisfying glimpses, that the temptation to guess at\r\nthe ideal face almost overpowers the desire to kiss the real and shining\r\nfeet below. Unfortunately, there is the domain of the myths and\r\nimmaterials, _there_ is the home of the law and the force, _there_ dwell\r\nthe Odyles, the electricities, the magnetisms, and affinities, and there\r\nthe speculative Æneas pursues shadows more fleeting than the Stygian\r\nghosts, and the grasp of the metaphysician closes on shapes whose\r\nembrace is vacancy. The bark that ploughs within this mystic expanse,\r\nsheds from its cleaving keel but coruscations of phosphorescent\r\nsparkles, which glimmer and quench in a gloom that Egyptian seers never\r\npenetrated, and modern guessers cannot conjecture through. There is,\r\nindeed, 'oak and triple brass' upon his breast who steeps his lips in\r\nthe chalice of the Rosicrucian, and the doom of Prometheus is the fabled\r\ndefeat which is waiting for the wanderer in those opaque spaces. While\r\nwe warily, therefore, tread not upon the ground whose trespass brought\r\nthe vulture of unfilled desire, the craving void for visionary lore upon\r\nthe heaven-born, earth-punished speculator, we can still find flowery\r\npaths and full fruition, in meadows wherein the light of reason requires\r\nno support from the _ignes fatui_ of imagination; meadows after all so\r\nbroad, that did not metaphysics 'teach man his tether,' they would seem\r\nillimitable. The book of nature is not spread before us, turning leaf\r\nafter leaf at every sunrise, with new delineations on every page, to be\r\nstared at with vacant inanity, or criticized with imbecile verbosity.\r\nThe rivulet does not tinkle and the sky does not look blue that people\r\nmay feed the ear alone with the one, or satisfy the eye alone with the\r\nother; the nerves which carry the sensation to the brain, flutter with\r\nthe news, and knock at the house of mind for explanation. We do not\r\nanticipate being hurried into any extravaganza about the rural felicity\r\nof green trees, clinking cowbells, cane chairs, and cigars, when we\r\nrecall to the trainer of surburban vines the harmony, the analogy, the\r\nrelationship, which he must have observed between sounds and colors in\r\nnature's album of melodies.\r\n\r\nWhen, at evening, the zenith blue melts away toward the horizon in\r\ndreamy violet, and the retreating sun leaves limber shafts of orange\r\nlight, like Parthian arrows, among the green branches of the elms, what\r\nsounds can charm the ear like the soft chirrup of the cricket, the\r\nhomely drone of the hive-seeking bee, and the cool rustle of the breeze\r\nthrough the tops of the spring-sodden water grasses? How fondly the mind\r\nblends the evening colors and the incipient voices of the night! 'Oh,'\r\nsays the metaphysician, 'this is association: just so a strain of music\r\nreminds you of a fine passage in a book you have read, or a beautiful\r\ntone in a picture you have seen; just so the Ranz des Vaches bears the\r\nexile to the timber house, with shady leaves, corbelled and\r\nstrut-supported, whose very weakness appeals to the avalanche that\r\nshakes an icicly beard in monition from the impeding crags.'\r\n\r\nWell, let association play her part in some cases; when a habit has\r\nnecessitated the recurrence of two distinct ideas together, they will\r\ncertainly be associated at times when the habit is gone; but suppose the\r\nanalogy is felt when the ideas have never before been in juxtaposition,\r\nor when there has even been no sensation at all to generate one of the\r\nnotions. How, for instance, did the sightless imaginer ever conceive\r\nthat red must be like the sound of the trumpet? Simply because the\r\nanalogy between color and music is deeper than the idea of either, more\r\nabsolute than association could make it; because certain tints are\r\ncalculated to produce exactly similar impressions on the eye that\r\ncertain sounds do upon the ear; or, to use a mathematical turn of\r\nexpression, because some color [Greek: x] is to the eye as some sound\r\n[Greek: x] is to the ear.\r\n\r\nThat this mathematical turn of expression is no vagary, but perfectly\r\ngermane to the subject, and accurate in application, we propose to prove\r\nto those who love coincidences and analogies sufficiently to fish them\r\nout of a little dilute science.\r\n\r\nLight and sound are the daughters of motion. Color and music, the\r\nethereal and aërial offspring of this ancestry, born with the world,\r\nfostered in Biblical times, expanded in China and Egypt, living on the\r\npainted jar, and breathing in the oaten reed, deified in Greece, and\r\nanalyzed to-day, are natural cousins at the least, and they have come\r\nfrom the spacious home of their progenitor, upon our dusky and silent\r\nsphere, like Peace and Goodwill, with hands bound in an oath and\r\ncontract never to part. We will spare a dissertation on chaos; we will\r\nnot speak of matter and inertia; but as our greatest and purest fountain\r\nof light is the sun, we may be allowed a modest exposition of his\r\nphilosophical state, as a granite gate to the garden beyond. Ninety-five\r\nmillions of miles to the north, east, south, or west of us, up or down,\r\nas the case may be, stands the molten centre of our system--an orb,\r\nwhose atoms, turbulent with electricity, gravity, or whatever mechanists\r\nplease to call the attraction of particle for particle, are forever\r\nurging to its centre, forever meeting with repulsions when they slide\r\nwithin the forbidden limits of molecular exclusiveness, and eternally\r\nvibrating with a quake and quiver which lights and heats the worlds\r\naround. In other words, this agitation is one that, transmitted to an\r\nethereal medium, produces therein corresponding vibrations or waves,\r\nwhich are light and heat.\r\n\r\nAs sound is the symmetrical aërial motion, if our atmosphere embraced\r\nour sun, and extended throughout space, we should _perhaps_ hear in the\r\nambient the fundamental chord, resolvable into the diatonic scale--as we\r\nlook upon the beam of white which the prism decomposes into the solar\r\nspectrum, and in the ghostly watches of the night, we might recognize\r\nthe 'music of the spheres' as the planets rushed around their airy\r\norbits, with a noise like the 'noise of many waters,' no longer a poetic\r\nillusion, but a harmonic fact.\r\n\r\nLight, whether white or colored, is transmitted through ether in waves\r\nof measurable length: each atom of the medium, when disturbed, moves\r\naround its place of rest in an orbit of variable dimension and\r\neccentricity. On the character of the orbit depends the character of the\r\nlight; and on the velocity of orbit motion, its intensity. Like the\r\ngentle pulsations which circle from the point where fell the pebble in\r\nthe purple lake, come the grateful twilight waves, red with the last\r\nkiss of day; like the fierce struggles of the storm-beaten ocean floods\r\ncome the lightning waves, blazing through the thunder clouds, howling in\r\nriven agony: so great is the variety of character in these orbicular\r\ndisturbances, which, acting upon the optic nerves, produce the sensation\r\nof multiform light and color.\r\n\r\nWaves of light, like waves of sound, are of different lengths, and while\r\nthe eye prefers some single waves to others, it recognizes a harmony in\r\ncertain combinations, which it cannot discover in different ones.\r\n\r\nWhile, however, the constitution of individual eyes acknowledges one\r\ncolor more pleasing than another, there is none, perhaps, which does not\r\nprefer the coldest monochromatic to entire absence of color, as in blank\r\nwhite, or to an absolute vacancy of light, as in black.\r\n\r\nSepia pieces are more agreeable than the neatest drawings in China ink,\r\nor the most graceful curves done in chalk upon a blackboard. But however\r\nthe eye may admire a severe and simple unity, it relishes still more a\r\nharmonious complexity; and a very mediocre little _pensée_ in water\r\ncolors, will prove more generally attractive than the monochromatic\r\ncopies in the Liber Veritatis.\r\n\r\nBut to this complexity there must be limits--an endless and incongruous\r\nvariety teases and revolts; the discordant effect of innumerable tints,\r\namong which some are sure to be uncongenial to each other, is always\r\nextremely irritating. There ought, then, to be a scale of color, it\r\nwould seem, within whose limits the purest harmonies are to be found,\r\nand beyond which subdivisions should be no more allowed than in constant\r\nmusical notes. When this idea strikes, as it must have, many artists,\r\nreason, consideration, instinct, and all, refer at once to the solar\r\nspectrum as such an one. The analogy between this scale, which governs\r\nthe chromatics of the sunset and thunderstorm, and that which the\r\nscience of man has established, empirically, for harmonies, is\r\nremarkable, and we shall try to make it patent. They are both scales of\r\nseven: the tonic, mediant, and dominant, find their types in red,\r\nyellow, and blue, while the modifications on which the diatonic scale is\r\nconstructed, resemble, numerically and esthetically, the well-known\r\nvariations in the spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe theory of harmonies in optics is the same as in acoustics, the same\r\nas in everything--it is based on simplicity. Those colors, like those\r\nnotes, the number of whose vibrations or waves in the same time bear\r\nsome simple ratio to each other, are harmonious; an absolute equality\r\nproduces unison; and a group of harmonies is melody both in music and in\r\ncolor. At this point we cannot but hint at the analogy already\r\ndiscovered between the elements of music and the elements of form.\r\nAngles harmonize in simple analysis, or intricate synthesis, whose\r\ncircular ratios are simple.\r\n\r\nNumerical proportions are the roots of that shaft of harmony which,\r\nspringing from motion, rises and spreads into the nature around us,\r\nwhich the senses appreciate, the spirit feels, and the reason\r\nunderstands. Beauty is order, and the infinity of the law is testified\r\nin the ever-swelling proofs of an unlimited consonance in creation, of\r\nwhich these analogies are the smallest types. But the idea of numerical\r\nanalogy is not new to our age, now that the atomic theory is\r\nestablished, and people are turned back to the days when the much\r\nbescouted alchemist pored with rheumy eyes over the crucible, about to\r\nbe the tomb of elective affinity, and whence a golden angel was to\r\ndevelop from a leaden saint: when they are reminded of the Pythagorean\r\nnumbers, and the arithmetic of the realists of old, they may very well\r\nimagine that the vain world, like an empty fashion, has cycled around to\r\nsome primitive phase, and look for the door of that academy 'where none\r\ncould enter but those who understood geometry.'\r\n\r\nBut to return. When the ear accepts a tone, or the eye a single color,\r\nit is noticed that these organs, satiated finally with the sterile\r\nsimplicity, echo, as it were, in a soliloquizing manner, to themselves,\r\nother notes or tints, which are the complementary or harmony-completing\r\nones: so that if nature does not at once present a satisfaction, the\r\norganization of the senses allows them internal resources whereon to\r\nretreat. 'There is a world without, and a world within,' which may be\r\ncalled complementary worlds. But nature is ever liberal, and her chords\r\nare generally harmonies, or exquisite modifications of concord. The\r\nchord of the tonic, in music, is the primal type of this harmony in\r\nsound; it is perfectly satisfactory to the tympanum; and the ear,\r\nknowing no further elements (for the tonic chord combines them all), can\r\nask for nothing more.\r\n\r\nThis chord, constructed on the tonic C, or Do, as a key note, and\r\nconsisting of the 1st, 3d, and 5th of the diatonic scale, or Do, Mi,\r\nSol, is called the fundamental chord. The harmony in color which\r\ncorresponds to this, and leaves nothing for the eye to desire, is, of\r\ncourse, the light that nature is full of--sunlight. White light is then\r\nthe fundamental chord of color, and it is constructed on the red as the\r\ntonic, consisting of red, yellow, and blue, the 1st, 3d, and 5th of the\r\nsolar spectrum.\r\n\r\nThis little analogy is suggestive, but its development is striking.\r\n\r\nThe diatonic scale in music, determined by calculation and actual\r\nexperiment on vibrating chords, stands as follows. It will be easily\r\nunderstood by musicians, and its discussion appears in most treatises on\r\nacoustics:\r\n\r\n  Do   Re   Mi   Fa  Sol   La   Ti   Do\r\n\r\n  C,   D,   E,   F,   G,   A,   B,   C, &c.\r\n\r\n  1   9/8  5/4  4/3  3/2  5/3  15/8  2.\r\n\r\nThe intervals, or relative pitches of the notes to the tonic C, appear\r\nexpressed in the fractions, which are determined by assuming the wave\r\nlength or amount of vibration of C as unity, and finding the ratio of\r\nthe wave length of any other note to it. The value of an interval is\r\ntherefore found by dividing the wave length of the graver by that of the\r\nacuter note, or the number of vibrations of the acuter in a given time\r\nby the corresponding number of the graver. These fractions, it is seen,\r\ncomprise the simplest ratios between the whole numbers 1 and 2, so that\r\nin this scale are the simple and satisfactory elements of harmony in\r\nmusic, and everybody knows that it is used as such. Now nature exposes\r\nto us a scale of color to which we have adverted; it is thus:\r\n\r\n  Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.\r\n\r\nLet us investigate this, and see if her science is as good as mortal\r\npenetration; let us see if she too has hit upon the simplest fractions\r\nbetween 1 and 2, for a scale of 7. We can determine the relative pitch\r\nof any member of this scale to another, easily, as the wave lengths of\r\nall are known from experiment.\r\n\r\nThe waves of red are the longest; it corresponds, then, to the tonic.\r\nLet us assume it as unity, and deduce the pitch of orange by dividing\r\nthe first by the second.\r\n\r\nThe length of a red wave is 0.0000266 inches; the length of an orange\r\nwave is 0.0000240 inches; the fraction required then is 266/240;\r\ndividing both members of this expression by 30, it reduces to 9/8,\r\nalmost exactly. This is encouraging. We find a remarkable coincidence in\r\nratio, and in elements which occupy the same place on the corresponding\r\nscales. Again, the length of a yellow wave is 0.0000227 inches; its\r\npitch on the scale is therefore 266/227; dividing both terms by 55, the\r\nreduced fraction approximates to 5/4 with great accuracy, when we\r\nconsider the deviations from truth liable to occur in the delicate\r\nmeasurements necessary to determine the length of a light vibration, or\r\nthe amount of quiver in a tense cord. A green wave is 0.0000211 inches\r\nin length; its pitch is then 266/211, which reduced, becomes 4/3; in\r\nlike manner the subsequent intervals may be determined, which all prove\r\nto be complete analogues, except, perhaps, violet, whose fraction is\r\n266/167, which reduces nearer 16/9 than 15/8. But these small\r\ndiscrepancies, which might be expected in the results of physical\r\nmeasurements, do not cripple the analogy which appears now in the two\r\nfollowing scales:\r\n\r\n\r\n  DIATONIC OR NATURAL SCALE OF MUSIC.\r\n\r\n  C,   D,   E´,  F,   G,   A,   B,   C´   D´   E´, &c.\r\n\r\n  1   9/8  5/4  4/3  3/2  5/3  15/8  2  18/8  10/4\r\n\r\n\r\n  DIATONIC OR NATURAL SCALE OF COLOR.\r\n\r\n  Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet.\r\n  1     9/8      5/4     4/3   3/2    5/3     16/9\r\n\r\n\r\nThus orange is to red what D is to C; and to resume the proportion we\r\nused before, red is to eye as C is to ear; yellow: eye: Mi: ear; and so\r\non the proportion extends, till the analogy embraces chords, harmonies,\r\nmelodies, and compositions even.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned the chord of the tonic, and the corresponding\r\neye-music, red, yellow, and blue; let us consider the chord of the\r\ndominant or 5th note, whose analogue is blue. This chord is constructed\r\non the 5th of the diatonic as a fundamental note, and consists of the\r\n5th, 7th, and 9th, or returning the 9th an octave, the 5th, 7th, and 2d.\r\nThe parallel harmony among the spectral colors is blue, violet, and\r\norange. The name 'dominant' indicates the nature of this chord; its\r\noften recurring importance in harmonic combinations of a certain key\r\nmake it easily recognized, and it is even more pleasing than the tonic\r\nin its subdued character.\r\n\r\nOut of doors this chord is preëminent in the sunset key, and the western\r\nskies ever chant their evening hymn in the 5th, 7th, and 2d of the\r\nethereal music. The correspondence of the sub-dominant would be red,\r\ngreen, and indigo; of the chord of the 6th, red, yellow, and indigo; and\r\nso on, the curious mind may elicit the symmetrical to any notes, half\r\nnotes, or combinations of notes. It is evident that as a note may be\r\ninterpolated between any two of the scale, for reach or variety, and\r\ncalled, _e.g._ [sharp]-F or [flat-]G, so a half tint between green and blue\r\nis a kind of analogical [sharp]green or [flat]blue.\r\n\r\nIt seems to us that the elementary angles which Mr. Hay conceives to be\r\nthe tonic, mediant, and dominant, in formal symmetry, will soon be\r\nproved to decompose into a scale of linear harmony, forming another beam\r\nin this glory of natural analogy. These angles are the fundamental ones\r\nof the pentagon square, and equilateral triangle--respectively 108°,\r\n90°, and 60°. Some such scale it is known existed when art was at its\r\nculmination in buried Greece, and it was less the stupendous genius of\r\nher designers than the soul of the universe which their rules taught\r\nthem how to infuse into form, which rendered the marbles of Hellas\r\nsynonymes for immortality.\r\n\r\nThe most beautiful and conclusive, and yet most mysterious sign, that\r\npoints the seeker to the prosecution of this last analogy, remains yet\r\nfor us to remark, and for some investigator yet to take advantage of. It\r\nis the nodal figures which arrange themselves upon an elastic plate (as\r\nof glass), when it is made to vibrate (strewed with sand) by a fiddle\r\nbow drawn across its edge, so as to produce a pitch of some intensity.\r\nThese have been investigated, and found subject to certain laws, which\r\nlink into the chain of symmetry that philosophers have already grasped.\r\nAmong these figures, of which the simplest arise from the deepest\r\npitches, the angles mentioned occur.\r\n\r\nBut however interesting it might be to follow out these episodical\r\ninstances, they would lead us too far from our original compass.\r\n\r\nWe have plainly exhibited the identity of principle which governs the\r\nbases of sound and color, and might fairly write Q.E.D. to our\r\nproposition; but the fact so determined has a farther bearing upon art,\r\nwhich it may not be out of place to enlarge upon.\r\n\r\nThe painter's palette, charged with color, is the instrument with which\r\nhe thrills a melody to the eye, even as the magniloquent organ or the\r\nsigh-breathing flute speak to the ear. And just as the compass of all\r\ninstruments is constructed on the diatonic scale, so should the range of\r\nthe palette depend upon the tinges of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nWhile artists of a certain school pretend to imitate Nature, who paints\r\nliterally with a pencil dipped in rainbow, they make use of a\r\ncomplication of tints, at which their goddess would shudder. In mixing\r\nand mixing on the groaning palette, they generate an unhappy brood of\r\nmisformed tones, which never can agree upon the canvas; while the\r\npigments, impure at best, become doubly so by amalgamation, the\r\nramifications of contrast which such differences superinduce are sure to\r\nprove sometimes repulsive.\r\n\r\nContrast is nature's charm, the bubbling source that she exhausts for\r\nher prettiest harmonies and varieties.\r\n\r\nBut earthen pitchers are easily broken at the brink, and if the\r\nslippery streams thence flowing are not judiciously checked, they merge\r\ninto a harsh flood that sweeps away all grace, like the magic fountain\r\nin the German myth, whose fairy tricklings, uncovered for a single\r\nnight, burst into a curbless flood, that drowned the sleeping landscape\r\nere the dawn. The small reactions of contrast in infinitesimal tints,\r\nare perhaps neglected or unforeseen, but their influence is fearfully\r\napparent in the end.\r\n\r\nThe simplicity of beauty is very limited, and he who dabbles in infinite\r\ndecompositions of color will be certain to encounter turbid and\r\nunnatural tones, whose ultimate result will be an inharmonious and\r\ndisunited whole.\r\n\r\nIt is true that in the landscape, and cloudscape, and waterscape, there\r\nare wonderful extremes of chromatic gradation, for it is the hand and\r\nmind of nature that adorns herself; she can see unerringly, and lay on\r\ndivinely, the remotest intricacies of shade, and her colors are pure\r\nlight, swimming in ether.\r\n\r\nBut these media do not come bottled up in tin tubes, and to this gift a\r\nmortal hand ought not to presume. It might as well aspire to draw\r\ninfinitely as to tint infinitesimally; for before it can find use for\r\nall the colors in nature, it ought to have all nature upon the canvas.\r\nBut finally, we hold that reproductive art is as much part and parcel of\r\nhuman nature as the appreciative, or sensation of beauty; and that any\r\none can learn to copy and color a landscape or design, as well as to\r\nperform upon a musical instrument. Let genius still wield the creative\r\nwand, but in the wide domain of art, over his grotto alone be it\r\nwritten, _Procul o procul este profani_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONE OF THE MILLION.\r\n\r\n\r\nShoemaker Scheffer opened his shop within sight of the college\r\nbuildings, and expected to live by trade. He was young and skilful,\r\nobliging, and prompt, and acquired, ere long, a substantial reputation.\r\nProsperity did not mislead him; he applied his income to the furtherance\r\nof his business, abhorred debt, squandered nothing, was exact and\r\npersevering.\r\n\r\nAt work early and late, he seemed the model of contentment, as he was of\r\nindustry. Prompt, obliging, careful, he made the future easy of\r\nprediction.\r\n\r\nBut though the ruddy firelight shines well on the window panes, what\r\ngriefs, what agonies, what discords, are developed around the\r\nhearthstone. Scheffer's quiet demeanor was, in some degree, deception.\r\nOne woman in the world knew it was so--no other being did.\r\n\r\nThe immediate excitant of his unrest was found in the college students,\r\nwho passed his place of business at all hours of the day. He remembered\r\nthat he might have worked his way into the ranks of those fellows.\r\nNothing vexed him so much as to see a lounger among them; for he must\r\nneeds think of the time when, a stripling, he agonized over his choice,\r\nand said to himself, thinking of his mother (dead now, when the comfort\r\nhe toiled for was secured), 'Time enough for books when I am sure of\r\nbread; flesh is needy and perishing, spirit is eternal.' He had walked\r\nout of school to the counter of his uncle, and stood behind it seven\r\nyears, doing with earnest might what his hand found to do.\r\n\r\nAnd here he was now, on his own ground, wistfully looking over his\r\nbarriers into the college yard, and, shall we say it, envying the\r\ncareer of every studious lad--most of all that of the scholarly Harry\r\nCromwell, and the broad-browed, proud young Mitchell, who came into his\r\nshop now and then, in remembrance of old days; for these lads could all\r\nremember when they stood in one straight line among the social forces,\r\nand neither had marched out of the old division to take rank in the new.\r\n\r\nOne day Paul Mitchell strolled into Scheffer's shop. Scheffer, at the\r\nmoment, was reading a newspaper, and he did not instantly throw the\r\nsheet aside: he thought it unlikely that Paul required his service. But\r\nat last, laying the paper away, and going up to Mitchell, he asked:\r\n\r\n'What will you have, this morning?'\r\n\r\nPaul's bright eyes smiled, full of fun.\r\n\r\n'I'll have fifty thousand dollars, straight, and a library like that in\r\nthe Atheneum.'\r\n\r\n'You want shoeing more,' was Scheffer's dry response; and, turning from\r\nthe youth, he went back to his counter, and emptied thereon a large box\r\nof patent leathers, which he began to assort.\r\n\r\nGradually Paul approached, and at last he took up a pair of the boots,\r\nand asked the price. Scheffer named it; Paul threw them down again.\r\n\r\n'You might as well ask fifty dollars as three. It's you fellows who have\r\nall the money.'\r\n\r\n'Do you think so?' answered Scheffer; and he began to collect his goods\r\nagain, and to pack them in separate boxes. He was careful, however, to\r\nthrow aside the pair that had tempted Mitchell to confess a truth.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the counter was cleared, he took the boots, and said to\r\nthe boy, pointing to one of the sofas:\r\n\r\n'Sit down there, my man.'\r\n\r\nPaul did as bidden. Scheffer untied his shoestring, drew off the dusty,\r\nworn-out shoe, and tried the pair in his hand. The fit was perfect.\r\n\r\nThen Scheffer looked up, and, without rising, asked:\r\n\r\n'How long have you to study before you graduate?'\r\n\r\n'Five years.'\r\n\r\n'Why do you speak in that way?'\r\n\r\n'How did I speak?' asked Paul.\r\n\r\n'Discouraged like.'\r\n\r\n'You're mistaken.'\r\n\r\n'Am I? Then why look so solemn? I'd like your chance.'\r\n\r\n'You would!' exclaimed Paul, incredulous. 'Why, you had such a chance\r\nyourself once, and you didn't accept it, if they know the facts at\r\nhome.'\r\n\r\nScheffer stood up.\r\n\r\n'Who says that?' he asked, quietly. Still, the question had a hurried\r\nsound to Paul. '_Did_ any one in that house remember!'\r\n\r\n'Josephine told me so. She thinks you made a wise choice. So do I. I\r\nwish I was as well off as you are, doing something for a support. And it\r\nwas on account of your mother you made the choice! But my mother insists\r\non my having a profession. Stuff! But nobody seems satisfied. That's one\r\nkind of consolation.'\r\n\r\nScheffer was silent for a moment. Half of Paul's words were unheard; but\r\nenough had struck through sense to spirit, and he said:\r\n\r\n'Do you want to be shod for the next five years? I'll strike a bargain\r\nwith you, Paul.'\r\n\r\n'What can I do for you?' asked the astonished lad.\r\n\r\n'I'll tell you, and if you don't like it, why, no matter--that's all.'\r\nAnd Scheffer added, in an earnest tone: 'I don't know but it's living\r\nnear the college, hearing the bell ring, and seeing the fellows with\r\ntheir books, has bewitched me; any way, I'm thinking I must have an\r\neducation, and I wish to get it systematically. I always thought I could\r\nhave it when I chose; but if I don't bestir myself, I shall not be able\r\nto choose much longer.'\r\n\r\nAugust wiped his forehead as he spoke; but he had said it. Gravely,\r\nanxiously he looked at Paul. He could have forgiven him even a smile.\r\nBut Paul did not smile. Neither did he hesitate too long to rob his\r\nwords of grace.\r\n\r\n'What will you study?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'Whatever you set me at.'\r\n\r\n'Latin?'\r\n\r\n'They say a fool is not a perfect fool till he has studied Latin. No, I\r\nthank you. Five years, did you say?'\r\n\r\n'Five years,' repeated Paul, this time without sighing.\r\n\r\n'Well, get the books I need. You know what they are. Bring the bill to\r\nme. Have it made out in your name, though, I'll settle the account.\r\nMum's the word, Paul. I won't have snobs laughing at the learned\r\nshoemaker. The secret is mine.'\r\n\r\nPaul promised. Scheffer thereupon picked up the student's worn-out\r\nshoes, and tossed them into a distant heap of rubbish, and the lad went\r\non his way rejoicing. He was a widow's son, and poor; and to be shod as\r\na gentleman should be was a serious matter to him.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBut, as to the secret, there was Josephine, who shared the family burden\r\nof poverty and pride; Josephine, who was a beauty, and not spoiled at\r\nthat, but light of heart and cheerful, disposed to make the best of\r\nthings; laughing lightly over mishaps which made her mother weep;\r\nJosephine, of whose fair womanhood as much was hoped in a worldly way as\r\nof Paul's talents; Josephine, to whom Paul told everything: how could he\r\nwithhold from her August Scheffer's curious secret?\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, when he went home, Paul found her in the porch. She had\r\na book; of course, it was one of Cromwell's. Paul discovered that when\r\nhe had settled himself near her, with a book in his own hand. He had\r\ncome to her so conscious of his late bargain, and the immediate benefit\r\nhe had derived therefrom, that he expected an instant leaning toward\r\ndiscovery on her part. But Josephine was absorbed in her occupation, and\r\nthough she looked up and smiled when she saw Paul coming, she looked\r\ndown again and sighed the next instant, and continued reading with a\r\ngravity that soon attracted his notice. Her looks troubled him. Of late,\r\na shadow seemed to have fallen darkly over her; she was, though Paul\r\nunderstood it not, in the struggle of youth with life. Do you know what\r\nthat struggle is? Not all who pass through it go on their way rejoicing,\r\nover the everlasting blessedness won from the 'good and great angel.'\r\nFor then this earth more manifestly were the world of the redeemed ones.\r\n\r\nNot long before, Paul had heard Josephine say that she would not live on\r\nin this idle way. She must find some work to do. Perhaps, he thought,\r\nthe sense of a necessity her mother instantly and constantly denied when\r\nJosephine spoke of it, is now again oppressing her. However occasioned,\r\nPaul's face saddened when he looked at her. The maddening impatience he\r\nhad felt many times--impatience for the strength and efficiency of\r\nmanhood--once more tormented him; it grew an intolerable thought to him\r\nthat so many years must pass before he should be prepared to do a man's\r\nwork, earn a man's wages--do as August Scheffer was doing.\r\n\r\nSuch sombre reflections as these absorbed him, when he became suddenly\r\nconscious of the eyes of Josephine. She sat looking upon him; disturbed\r\nanew, it seemed, by the show of his disturbance. His eyes met hers, and\r\nshe said:\r\n\r\n'What is it, Paul? What has gone wrong with you?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing. But it is enough to give one the horrors to see _you_ looking\r\nso like destruction. Something has happened, Josephine; what is it?'\r\n\r\n'What fine shoes you have on, Paul!' she said, quickly, pretending to be\r\nabsorbed in the discovery she had only that instant made.\r\n\r\nPaul laughed, and blushed.\r\n\r\n'I earned them,' said he.\r\n\r\n'Earned them!' Josephine's beautiful eyes were full of surprise, of\r\nadmiration even, as she now fixed them on her brother. 'I wish I could\r\nearn anything--a row of pins, or a loaf of bread.'\r\n\r\n'If you did, you wouldn't eat all the loaf yourself. But I spent all my\r\nwage on myself, you see! But I did earn them--at least, I'm going to,\r\nbefore I get through.'\r\n\r\n'How in the world did you do it, Paul?'\r\n\r\n'I am a tutor, Josephine,' said he, with mock gravity. She answered,\r\nearnestly:\r\n\r\n'You're a good fellow, any way, tutor or not. It's a secret, then, this\r\nbusiness?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, the deadest kind of a dead secret. But I shall tell you. I made a\r\nmental reservation of you. August Scheffer----'\r\n\r\nJosephine started, trembled, looked away from Paul, recovered herself in\r\nan instant; then looked back again, and straight into his eyes. Paul saw\r\nnothing strange in this; he went on quietly:\r\n\r\n'Scheffer is getting ambitious! If I had a shop and such a business as\r\nhis, catch me bothering about books!'\r\n\r\n'He was always fond of reading,' answered Josephine. 'You know what a\r\nreader his mother was? No, you don't know. You were too young. Well, he\r\nwants you to help him, and you are to be shod.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, that's the whole of it. Why don't you laugh, or be surprised. I\r\nshall do my best with him.'\r\n\r\n'I should hope you would do better than your best. Be punctual and\r\nsteady in this business; for, really, you owe August Scheffer more than\r\na shop full of shoes is worth. You will get as much good as you can\r\npossibly give. I wish I had your chance!'\r\n\r\n'To teach him, Josephine?'\r\n\r\n'To be a helpful man, dear Paul.'\r\n\r\n'As far as I can see, everybody in these days is wishing that he was\r\nsomebody else. That's what's the matter with Scheffer.'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Josephine, quietly; 'it isn't. Not that. He wouldn't take any\r\nman's place that lives. Ask him.'\r\n\r\n'Of course he would say 'No.' He is proud as Lucifer.'\r\n\r\n'I like his spirit.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, and you like Cromwell's spirit, too. What in the world do you\r\nsuppose _he_ is going to do?'\r\n\r\n'What?' asked Josephine, as if she did not know.\r\n\r\nPaul surveyed her for a moment. _Did_ she not know? He could not decide.\r\nHe could look through most people, simple, earnest, penetrating fellow\r\nthat he was; but not through Josephine.\r\n\r\n'Cromwell is going abroad,' he said, finally. 'He's been talking with a\r\nsea captain for a month back. It's all out now. He's going to quit his\r\nclass, and take deck passage for Havre; going to the school of mines in\r\nParis, and, when through with that, on a mineral hunt from Africa to\r\nSiberia. And he hasn't a cent of money! Perhaps that's the spirit you\r\nlike. Perhaps you won't object to my going with him.'\r\n\r\nJosephine looked at Paul; she was not in the least alarmed. 'I like the\r\nspirit well enough,' she said, 'but it isn't your kind; it would be\r\nmisery to do a thing in that way, for you. He has another 'fervor.''\r\n\r\n'Yes, he has,' said Paul, with a deeper meaning than his sister guessed.\r\n\r\n'You say I like a queer kind of spirit,' said she. 'I like independence.\r\nBut there's some great lack in me, there must be. I'm what you call too\r\nprudent, I suppose. I seem unable to put out of sight the chances of\r\nfailure; and it can't be that people who venture a great deal think much\r\nof them. I wish, as you do, that Harry had a little money--ever so\r\nlittle--to fall back on. He never seems to think of accidents, or\r\nsickness; but he is going to a strange country, and, to be sure, if he\r\nis able to do exactly what he expects, he will succeed; and in the _end_\r\nhe will, I know, whatever happens. But it would be dreadful for him to\r\nmeet with misfortunes, though he laughs at my croaking. Everything is to\r\nturn out just as he wants! But do things often, I wonder?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, with August Scheffer--the only one I know of.'\r\n\r\n'But you never _can_ know the struggle he passed through; it was\r\nterrible. You call him a philosopher; he is so, because he found out\r\nearly how to fight the good fight. Nothing will ever look so alluring to\r\nhim as the career he might have had by choosing the thing he did not\r\nchoose.' Ceasing to speak aloud and to Paul, Josephine added, in a voice\r\nno one could hear: 'I was in the midst of that struggle; I understand\r\nhim as no one else does. And--he knows it.'\r\n\r\n'Tell me about it,' said Paul. 'You don't know how much I admire\r\nScheffer.'\r\n\r\n'Well you may,' she answered; 'but there is nothing to tell. He had the\r\nopportunity to keep at school, or to go into his uncle's shop--and he\r\nchose the shop on his mother's account.'\r\n\r\n'And I chose a profession on _my_ mother's account,' said Paul bitterly.\r\n\r\nJosephine laid her hand on his; it was a gentle touch, but it recalled\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n'The best choice in both cases,' said she. 'Any one can see you are not\r\nexpert enough to make a successful trader. Ask August if a man must not\r\nhave a talent for trade, just as an artist must have a genius for\r\npainting.'\r\n\r\n'Then you think August a born trader?'\r\n\r\n'I know he can do more than one thing well,' she answered.\r\n\r\n'If you think so well of August,' said he, 'I don't see how you _can_\r\nthink better of another fellow. The town couldn't contain him if he\r\nheard what you said just now.'\r\n\r\nJosephine turned a page of her book.\r\n\r\n'He knows perfectly well what I think of him, Paul.'\r\n\r\nThe very frankness of her words and manner misled the boy. The curious\r\nsuspicion that for a moment had beset him fled fast before his laughter.\r\n\r\nShe went on reading--seemed to do so. But an image for which the writer\r\nof that book was not responsible stood, all the while, clear and\r\nimmovable in her memory. Before her, in a rude shed, were a boy and a\r\ngirl. The girl had a basket in her hand, filled with chips, which she\r\nhad raked from the sawdust; the boy was offering her assistance; but he\r\nknew well enough there was no wood to be sawn or split. It was growing\r\ndark and cold within the house, and still more dismal without it. The\r\nhearts of these two are warmer than their hands.\r\n\r\n'I've done it,' said the boy. 'I brought my books home last night,\r\nJosey, and I'm going to my uncle in the morning.'\r\n\r\n'What did he say?'\r\n\r\n'He wouldn't say a word. It was my choice, and I must stand by it,' he\r\nanswered. 'It's for my mother! If I had only you, and was working for\r\nyou, I would take the other track. But, you see, it is for her; and I'm\r\nher only son.'\r\n\r\n'You will be August Scheffer, whatever you may do,' she said, in a soft,\r\nsweet voice.\r\n\r\n--And did August Scheffer ever stand for less among powers and places,\r\nthan when, in the darkening wood shed, he spoke these words:\r\n\r\n'But, Josey, will things always be the same with us?'\r\n\r\n--Things had changed, indeed. The whole world had changed since then.\r\nHad the changing world rolled in between them? Since then the widow\r\nMitchell had worked her way out of the worst of her distresses.\r\nJosephine had become a beautiful woman. Paul was striding on toward a\r\nprofession. The family had removed to one of those box-like dwellings\r\nopposite the college grounds, and the fair face of Mrs. Mitchell's\r\ndaughter was the theme of many a student's dreaming--of Harry\r\nCromwell's, most conspicuous among students--of his dreaming, day and\r\nnight. It was his book she held.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIt happened, of course, that Paul dropped into Scheffer's shop the next\r\nday. August was on the lookout, and conducted him forthwith into a quiet\r\ncorner. The books were there delivered, but the package remained\r\nunopened. Scheffer had his reasons. He wanted leisure to examine\r\nthem--above all, privacy. He also saw, or thought he saw, that Paul was\r\nin haste to be gone; and there was something on his mind of which he\r\ndesired to be free.\r\n\r\nPaul was only disturbed about a proposal he wished to make to Scheffer.\r\n\r\nHe was electrified when Scheffer himself broached the subject, and\r\ntransacted it half, at a stroke, though all unconsciously, by asking:\r\n\r\n'What has become of Hal Cromwell? He took so many prizes last year.'\r\n\r\nPaul's eyes brightened strangely, his whole countenance became luminous.\r\nScheffer surveyed the change as if it were not half agreeable to him.\r\n'Harry is here yet, but he won't be long. That's a secret, though. He's\r\ngoing to France. Guess how.'\r\n\r\n'In a balloon, I suppose. He hasn't any money.'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Paul, half offended at the tone in which this was spoken.\r\n'He's going to work his passage. He's one of the fellows who can do\r\nwithout money.'\r\n\r\n'Indeed!' said Scheffer.\r\n\r\nPaul went on: 'He hasn't more than twenty dollars. He sold all his\r\nprizes long ago.'\r\n\r\n'Is he going to travel?' asked Scheffer, quietly.\r\n\r\n'Travel! no. Not yet awhile, I mean. He's mad, just now, on minerals and\r\ngeology. He's going to school in Paris, where he can learn all about\r\nsuch things. Then he's going to hunt up specimens for cabinets; then\r\nhe'll be sending curiosities over here by the ship load. If any one\r\nwanted to speculate, he'd pay an enormous interest on the money lent\r\nhim. But catch him asking the loan of a threepenny bit of any man! You\r\nknow him.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' he said; 'we've had many a rough day together. About the time his\r\nfather got into trouble, my father did more than one good turn for him.\r\nBut that's neither here nor there.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, it is,' said Paul, quickly; 'if your father helped his father,\r\nit's a token that you will help him.'\r\n\r\nScheffer was not so clear on that point: his reply might have chilled\r\nPaul's enthusiasm, could anything have done that.\r\n\r\n'I can tell you what, Mitchell,' he said, 'I don't wonder at Cromwell,\r\nand I don't blame him. I believe it's better to go hungry on your own\r\nearnings than full fed at another man's expense. One can starve at home\r\nwith a better grace than he can among strangers. That's my mind. It\r\nmayn't be his.'\r\n\r\n'It's mine, though,' said Paul. 'If I had the money--if I had a hundred\r\ndollars, I should insist on his taking them. I wish my mother had put me\r\nto a trade: it's all nonsense, this slaving for the sake of\r\nposition--what you call it.'\r\n\r\n'Don't talk so,' said Scheffer. 'If Harry Cromwell wants anything of me,\r\nI should be ashamed of him if he wouldn't ask it. As to wishing that you\r\nhad a trade, if there's a mechanical turn in you, you'll twist into it\r\nyet. But I don't believe there is. Go on as you have begun. It will all\r\ncome out right.'\r\n\r\nPaul scanned the fine face of the speaker in a spirit of inquiry\r\nunguessed of August. He was thinking of Josephine, and of her words.\r\nThen he said, 'So you always say. But I can't see it. If I could, then\r\nI'd be a philosopher like you. Do you mean I should speak to Harry?'\r\n\r\nScheffer hesitated.\r\n\r\n'I see him every day,' said he. 'Sometimes he comes in here. Don't you\r\nthink he would be better pleased if it should happen of itself, you\r\nknow--not as if we had talked over his affairs. He is such a proud\r\nfellow.'\r\n\r\nPaul readily acceded to this plan. He told Josephine what he had done,\r\nand she worked on with a lighter heart. She was thinking of Scheffer.\r\nHow slowly he had grown up into her sight again! Man and woman, if they\r\nlooked at each other now, must it be across a great gulf? What had\r\neducation done for her! Could she thank the teaching that had brought\r\nher to see in her womanhood something beyond the reach of a man like\r\nScheffer? Could she thank the culture that gave her a position for which\r\nnature and habits like his were all unfit? This maturity seemed\r\nunnatural to the heart of that remembered childhood, which, in its\r\nbrave, loving generosity, could trust a boy to any work or station,\r\nfeeling that in the workman would be securely lodged himself.\r\n\r\nEven more than she suspected, Josephine had been moved by the secret\r\nPaul had confided to her--of Scheffer's new ambition. No new ambition\r\nwas it, she could testify. In the fulness of time the bud had come to\r\nflower, and on the same stem fair fruits were ripening.\r\n\r\nAnd now, it was he who would relieve her of the anxiety she felt on\r\nCromwell's behalf. She kept these things in her heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nCromwell strolled into Scheffer's shop within the week. When Scheffer\r\nsaw him coming, he satisfied himself at a glance that the visit was an\r\nunsuggested one.\r\n\r\nThere was only one other person in the world whose appearance within his\r\ndoors could so much disturb the master of the place as Harry Cromwell's.\r\nThat one was Josephine. Let _her_ but come, and it was a day indeed.\r\n\r\nBut the disturbance created by her presence was very different from that\r\nexcited by the entrance of this student. He, inadvertently, or\r\notherwise, and it mattered not which, set Scheffer's heart into such a\r\nfume of jealousy, as perhaps the heart of philosopher never knew before.\r\nFor, it was generally supposed among those who were interested in the\r\naffairs transacted on the point of space occupied by these people, that\r\nCromwell's ambition was less undefined than that of young men generally.\r\nIn short, that he was already, though alone in the world, burdened in\r\nmind with family cares--looking upon himself, even then, as the oldest\r\nson of the widow Mitchell.\r\n\r\nHe had said frankly, that he could not afford to give so much of his\r\nlife to preparatory study as would be required if he chose any one of\r\nthe professions open to him. He must go to work in some direction where\r\nthe rewards of labor were sooner obtained.\r\n\r\nWhen Cromwell came into the shop, August advanced to wait upon him.\r\nCromwell was in a cheerful mood. He stretched his hand across the\r\ncounter, and shook hands with his old acquaintance, as if he were\r\nthinking of days when the little white house of Daniel Scheffer stood\r\nbetween two cottages, occupied respectively by families of equal poverty\r\nand condition--the Cromwells and the Mitchells.\r\n\r\nIt wasn't often that they met in these days, he said; and he looked\r\nabout him with a sort of surprise not disagreeable to Scheffer, for\r\nthere was nothing offensive in it. Scheffer was always ready to make\r\nallowance for the little vanities and weaknesses of others. He was not\r\nsurprised that Cromwell, handsome as he was, and brilliant\r\nintellectually, as he was proving himself to be, should overlook old\r\ntimes and old friends. Present times, and cares, and neighbors, would,\r\nof course, engage him to the neglect of what was past and gone.\r\n\r\n'Prospering as usual!' said Harry, 'How do you manage it, August? for I\r\nam going to launch out into the world, and I can't expect to succeed\r\nmore suddenly than you have.'\r\n\r\nAugust answered, taking the praise as if it were well meant, and he knew\r\nit was well earned:\r\n\r\n'By sticking to a thing, when I have made up my mind it is best. It's\r\nthe only way I know of, Harry. I thought, from all I had heard, that you\r\nhad found that out.'\r\n\r\n'Don't trust report. I've done little yet to satisfy a man; got a few\r\nprizes; what do you suppose I care for them?'\r\n\r\n'You care for what they mean to other folks,' said Scheffer.\r\n\r\n'Not much, I assure you. A little praise, like music, is pleasant. But a\r\nman can't live on sound. Show me your seven-league boots, Scheffer; I'm\r\ngoing to take a stroll around the world.'\r\n\r\n'What do you mean?' asked Scheffer, without moving.\r\n\r\n'I'm going over the ocean.'\r\n\r\n'India rubber soles?' asked Scheffer, again speaking in his quietest\r\nmanner, but really feeling great excitement.\r\n\r\nCromwell laughed. 'I suppose they have iron-bound boots, even in Paris;\r\nbut I thought I'd like to take something out of your shop with me;\r\nsomething of your own make, if possible. Do you know, Scheffer, you've\r\nhad more to do with me, a vast deal, than you ever supposed? I've had\r\nthe feeling that you were watching me as often as ever I got into lazy\r\nways, just as if you stood by that window and searched me out across the\r\ngrounds, no matter where I was lurking. I shall take my time when I am\r\nwell rid of you. But I'll have the boots for a token; and when I am\r\ntired and sick of my work, as I shall be a hundred times, I'll pretend\r\nthat you put some magic into the soles. Give them to me with a strong\r\nsqueak.'\r\n\r\nCromwell laughed, but he was at least two thirds in earnest.\r\n\r\nStill August did not stir. 'Are you really going away?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'If I'm a live man, next week.'\r\n\r\n'Going to France?'\r\n\r\n'To France. To Paris for one year. In five years I shall be home again,\r\nand I mean to bring with me two or three cabinets of minerals, worth\r\nthousands of dollars apiece.'\r\n\r\nCromwell's eyes flashed; they fell on Scheffer, who stood silent,\r\nmotionless, a cold shiver running over him from his head to his feet.\r\n\r\n'What, then, brave fellow?' asked August. It was well to know the worst,\r\nand Harry seemed to be in a communicative mood.\r\n\r\n'Why, what are _you_ working for?'\r\n\r\n'Because I've nothing else to do,' said Scheffer, with a shrug. 'I hate\r\nto be idle.'\r\n\r\n'No; you are making your fortune; you'll have a house and a family some\r\nday. It's written, a hundred girls would think the chance beyond their\r\ndesert; or they _might_ think so.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; well--I don't want a hundred girls.'\r\n\r\n'Nor one, I suppose.'\r\n\r\nBehind this idle talk the gravest and sharpest scrutiny was bestowed by\r\neach man on his fellow. Both were thinking of Josephine, but neither\r\nwould name her.\r\n\r\n'You're a philosopher, Paul says,' continued Cromwell. 'Paul is always\r\ntalking about you. I don't like to leave that boy; but knowing that you\r\nare his friend should make me comfortable. Beside, I couldn't do\r\nanything for the lad, if he stood in need of a ten-penny bit.'\r\n\r\nCromwell laughed, but not in recklessness--in pride.\r\n\r\n'How can you afford to travel, then?' asked Scheffer.\r\n\r\n'Oh, I shall go as some other good fellows have gone--on foot; for I\r\nshall work my passage, and get somehow from Havre to Paris.'\r\n\r\n'What next?'\r\n\r\n'Hard work, you know.'\r\n\r\n'Yes; I know what hard work means. But do you? Such hard work as this\r\nwill be?'\r\n\r\n'Do you take me for a dunce? Of course I know; and I shall tell you how\r\nI did it, five years from now.'\r\n\r\nThen Scheffer said, not hesitating--for anything like a doubtfulness of\r\nmanner on his part would have defeated his design:\r\n\r\n'I want to invest some money, Harry. Take a couple of hundred for me,\r\nand buy some of the specimens; or find them, if you like that better.\r\nYou shall sell them, when you get back, and pay me a percentage,\r\nwhatever you can afford.'\r\n\r\nThere was no delay in the answer. It had all the readiness, and the\r\nsound, of sincerity.\r\n\r\n'Sooner from you, August, than from any other man; but not from any man.\r\nI should feel that I was mortgaged. I must begin my own master, as I\r\ntold Josephine Mitchell. What I bring to her shall be fruit from the\r\ntree of my own planting.'\r\n\r\nAugust, for a moment, was like a man struck dumb; but when he spoke, he\r\nwas the philosopher again.\r\n\r\n'That's all foolishness,' he said, in a gentle voice; but there was no\r\ntenderness in it: it was but the firmness of self-control that made the\r\nvoice so mild, and the expostulation, so deliberate. 'It's like using an\r\nold tool, when you have a new invention that would save half the labor.\r\nYou'd laugh at a man for that.'\r\n\r\n'Laugh away! But I must go out my own man, Scheffer. You'd do the same\r\nthing. Don't talk about it. Have you any of those boots I asked for?'\r\n\r\nScheffer found a pair. He named the price. Cromwell paid for them, and\r\nshook his hand when they separated; for, in the press of business, he\r\nsaid, it might be he should not find time to call on his old friend\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe young men did not meet again. But a fortnight after Cromwell sailed,\r\nScheffer was called upon to pay a note at the bank; a note that bore his\r\nown signature, and stated that, for 'value received, I promise to pay to\r\nthe order of Henry Cromwell, four hundred dollars.'\r\n\r\nThe demand was made in such a manner, and at such a time, as to vex\r\nScheffer to the utmost.\r\n\r\nCromwell, it seemed, could not consent to accept a favor at his hands;\r\nyet he could condescend to make that manner of use of him! He paid the\r\nsum due on the note, but at the same time was beset by a sore\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\nThis was the temptation, and this his resistance: If Harry had gone,\r\nleaving anywhere, in any woman's heart, a hope in him, should he not\r\ndispel it? Should he not convince her that it rested on a foundation\r\nlooser than the sand? He did not do so! When Paul spoke now and then of\r\nCromwell, and prophesied proudly of him, August took the words as an\r\necho of Josephine's thought, and said to himself:\r\n\r\n'Oh! well; it makes no difference.'\r\n\r\nBut, for all that, he kept on with his studies, and sometimes on Sunday\r\nwould walk past the college grounds on Monumental square; for that was\r\nalso walking past the cottage occupied by Josephine.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nThe college, in those days, could have produced no student more\r\nindustrious than August.\r\n\r\nHe advanced with rapid strides through the elementary books, for he\r\nchose to begin at the beginning, and he was proud of his progress. But\r\nhe kept his studies secret. He would risk nothing by reporting his own\r\nprogress. No man should honor his future to the prejudice of his past.\r\nThe story of Minerva, born to the prerogatives of wisdom, was more\r\nattractive to him than that life which '_grew_ in grace, and in favor\r\nwith God and man.'\r\n\r\nHe had no plans in reference to future studies. His tutor was fairly\r\npuzzled; for he was not long in discovering that it was not the delight\r\nof knowledge, but the ends which knowledge may serve, that prompted to\r\nsuch industry.\r\n\r\nOne evening Paul threw himself on one of the red-plush sofas Scheffer\r\nhad transferred to his private apartment. He was in one of those serious\r\nmoods that had become frequent since Cromwell went away; or, rather,\r\nsince he had come into this near relation with a working and prosperous\r\nman.\r\n\r\n'It's easy enough to be poor for one's self,' said the anxious\r\nyoungster; 'but whether one _ought_ to be poor, when money is to be\r\nhonestly made, and at only a trifling risk, though by desperate hard\r\nwork--that's the question.'\r\n\r\n'H'm!' said Scheffer.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Paul, irritated by his seeming indifference, 'a fellow is\r\nin a deuced bad plight, if he has to plead poverty, when he ought to be\r\nable to help one or two beside himself! I envy you, Scheffer. I envy you\r\nevery time I come here. You can do so much! You could leap all the\r\ncollege gates in no time, if you were fool enough to try.'\r\n\r\n'I'm not,' said Scheffer. 'I know I can't work with many irons in the\r\nfire--never could. And I've nothing to complain of. I'm prospering, as\r\nyou say. That's the chief thing, I suppose. Folks seem to think so. I'm\r\none of the million; I must do as the rest--build a house, and marry a\r\nwife some day. But not till I can support her like a lady, I tell you,\r\nPaul.'\r\n\r\nThere was the difference of many years between the man and the boy, but\r\nto no other person was Scheffer in the habit of saying such things.\r\n\r\n'I'd like to see Madam Scheffer,' said Paul, with a quiet laugh.\r\nScheffer was indulgent toward that mirth; he smiled as he said:\r\n\r\n'Be patient, as I am, and you shall see her. There was a Mrs. Scheffer\r\nonce--my mother that was; if there's another like her--I believe there\r\nis!'\r\n\r\n'Can't you draw me her portrait?'\r\n\r\n'Perhaps I could, if I cared.'\r\n\r\n'But you don't care. Well, I can get it out of Josephine; she remembers\r\nyour mother.'\r\n\r\nPaul looked so much like his sister when he named the name of Josephine\r\nand of his mother in one breath, that Scheffer could not refuse him.\r\n\r\n'Medium size,' he said, 'and built to last. Graceful, as any mother\r\nwould have been--if--as she was, in spite of hard work--it was her\r\nnature, and her nature was a strong one. She has light hair, that curls\r\nas if it liked to, and her eyes are blue. It is a fair face, Paul, and\r\nshe has a kind smile.'\r\n\r\n'But tell me her name; for you need not say it's a fancy sketch.'\r\n\r\n'May be not; but that, you see, is my secret.'\r\n\r\nThere was no such thing, in reality, as intruding further on this\r\nground. Still, half embarrassed, Mitchell persisted:\r\n\r\n'Where is she, though?'\r\n\r\n'Where? I can't tell that.'\r\n\r\n'With Cromwell?'\r\n\r\n'It may be.'\r\n\r\n'Would you trust her with him?'\r\n\r\n'Is he not to be trusted?' asked August, so quickly as to startle Paul.\r\n\r\nIf Paul was to be startled--but he was not. The teller in the bank had\r\ntold him--(Paul was one of those persons with whom acquaintances of\r\nevery quality lodge their secrets)--of the note Scheffer had taken up\r\nwith so little fuss and so much amazement. He saw that August for a\r\nmoment suspected that he knew the facts, but he was not yet prepared to\r\nconfess such knowledge; for he knew as well as Scheffer what Harry\r\nCromwell was to Josephine. So he answered:\r\n\r\n'I should say so, August--if any man on earth could be.'\r\n\r\n'So I supposed,' said Scheffer, quietly; and Paul hurried back to the\r\nold queer topic, and said, half in jest: 'You mean to keep house,\r\nScheffer, I'll be bound.'\r\n\r\nScheffer's dark face brightened; he would share with Paul his pleasant\r\ndream--the pleasant dream he cherished, though his sober sense denied\r\nits possibility, and his consistent realism charged upon him the special\r\nfolly of fools.\r\n\r\n'Aye,' said he; 'there'll be a library in it--but more select than that\r\nof the Atheneum you were wishing for! You shall have the freedom of my\r\nhouse, lad--I'll not forget how kind you've been to me. I shall have a\r\nflower garden, and a yard deep enough for shade trees like those--but\r\nyou don't remember the place.'\r\n\r\nScheffer got up and walked away to the window.\r\n\r\n'I've not the slightest doubt that you'll do everything you say! I vow I\r\nwouldn't like to be the man to stand in your way to anything.'\r\n\r\nScheffer came back, and sat on the sofa beside Paul. His voice had an\r\nalmost fatherly tenderness in it when he began to speak, and it took no\r\ncolder tone.\r\n\r\n'You were saying something about an improvement you could suggest in\r\nsome of the tools we use. Here they are. What did you mean?' He pulled\r\nout a box from underneath the sofa.\r\n\r\nPaul took the box, and looked over its contents; but it was easy to see\r\nthat he was in search of nothing. He was soon through his investigation,\r\nand restored the box to its place. Then he looked at Scheffer, and\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\nBut Scheffer answered the look by one that seemed to say that he\r\nexpected an explanation; whereupon Paul, now grave enough, stirred by a\r\nsudden confidence, pulled from his pocket a box much smaller than that\r\nwhich held August's tools, and passed it into his friend's hands.\r\nScheffer took it, but he did not attempt to loosen the cord that secured\r\nthe cover. Then Paul said:\r\n\r\n'You do not really suppose that I am the only idle person in the world.\r\nI have been at work longer than Josephine, though you might not believe\r\nit; but what I have done, no one has yet seen. If I had the money,\r\nScheffer! I'd--well--look at the thing! I want you should study it, of\r\ncourse.'\r\n\r\nAugust, however, was in no haste. He was more desirous to learn the\r\nmeaning of what Paul had said about Josephine. But that could not be\r\nasked by him; and so he unfastened the cord, opened the box, and beheld\r\nwithin a miniature machine, whose meaning no one in the world, Paul\r\nMitchell excepted, could explain. That was Paul's thought of pride.\r\n\r\n'That's _my_ secret,' said he. 'That's my beauty! and I'd build a house\r\nfor it, if I had the money, to be sure, as you are going to do for\r\nyours. How do you like it?'\r\n\r\n'Explain; then I can tell you.' It was still the father-voice that\r\nspoke; but the tone was that of a man whose son has forestalled hope,\r\nand justified the most vague of ambitious wishes.\r\n\r\n'That, Scheffer, is a contrivance for printing. Will you please to\r\nexamine it? It's to be used henceforth, for all time, understand! by\r\nbankers in their banks, and by all men of great business. See--'\r\n\r\nHe arose, and brought near to the sofa a small table, on which he placed\r\nthe machine. Then he set it in motion. 'For numbering notes, and so on.\r\nDoes it work, August?'\r\n\r\nScheffer, though admiring and amazed, said not a word, but sat down\r\nbefore the machine, and studied it in every part.\r\n\r\nHis judgment was satisfied when at last he gave it.\r\n\r\n'It's worth money to you, Mitchell.'\r\n\r\n'Do you believe it, Scheffer? Worth money. Oh, my goodness!'\r\n\r\n'Paul, you expected that.'\r\n\r\n'I knew it; but to hear you say so, makes me feel like a man. Then I\r\nshall do for my mother what you did for yours, and get Josephine out of\r\nthat school-teaching freak of hers. She has actually gone and done it,\r\nScheffer.... Worth money, eh? Then I shall do some things as well as\r\nothers, Mr. Scheffer.'\r\n\r\nScheffer smiled. He understood this exultation too well not to share it\r\nand to be deeply moved by it.\r\n\r\n'I suppose so,' said he. 'I always believed in you.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, look here.'\r\n\r\nPaul's voice broke; he looked on the floor, and was a long time in\r\nproducing the second box. When he had fairly drawn it forth, he gave a\r\nsudden and wonderful look at Scheffer, that penetrated like fire to the\r\nheart of the man.\r\n\r\n'There,' said he, 'that's my pet. That's the Rachel of this Jacob. Look\r\nclose, and see what you'll do with it, supposing you turn lockpick some\r\nday.'\r\n\r\nIt was a veritable lock. He drew out a chain of keys, a hundred of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n'Now,' said he, in a low voice, 'you may ransack the town, as I've done,\r\nand get all your keys together. I want to see if you can find one, or\r\ncontrive one with any locksmith's help, that will fit into that lock.\r\nI'll give you a month to try it. I'd give another man six. But you'll do\r\nthe work of six in a sixth of the time. It's a lock on a new principle,\r\nand the principle is mine, because I applied it first. Eh? Hang it! If I\r\nhad the money I wouldn't be so beggarly poor as I am. But I've had to\r\nbeg and borrow, and almost steal, to get these things, that were in my\r\nbrain, into a decent shape, as you see them. When I get started,\r\nScheffer, you shall inspect all my inventions.'\r\n\r\n'Then you are started,' said August. 'Don't say that again, I'd mortgage\r\nmy stock but you should have what you need to help you. Have you any\r\ntools to work with, my son?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes; that is, my neighbor has. He keeps a carpenter's shop, you\r\nknow. I'm a capital hand at borrowing.'\r\n\r\n'Have you got a room at home where you can work?'\r\n\r\n'Acres of room! You've seen the house.'\r\n\r\n'I've walked past it sometimes,' answered Scheffer, with a smile.\r\n\r\n'Well, it isn't such a mite of a place as you'd think. There's room\r\nenough.'\r\n\r\n'It looks pretty and snug. I have often admired those flower beds; the\r\nplace don't look much like others in the same row: one might know that.\r\nPaul, I've seen the time when I'd thought the man who offered me help\r\nwas an angel. I'm older than you are. Of course you must experiment, and\r\nwhere's the merit of carrying plans about in your head a dozen years,\r\nwaiting a chance to prove whether they're worth anything or not? Tell me\r\nnow, do you want any money?'\r\n\r\n'No,' Paul answered quickly, yet with inward hesitation. 'I'll come to\r\nyou, though,' he added, 'when I do. I'll let you know the very day. But\r\nI I have something to study out yet. I'm going to get patents, you\r\nknow.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nPaul returned home, and in a musing mood seated himself under the\r\ngrapevine that grew on the brick wall in the rear of the cottage, the\r\nsole ornament and pride of the narrow yard. He may have been here an\r\nhour, when he heard strange noises in the house, then a heavy closing of\r\nthe street door, and the voice of Josephine calling him. In the lobby\r\nstood an open iron-bound chest. A glance at the box explained it to\r\nPaul; but he said nothing--not a word--in explanation to Josephine or\r\nhis mother, who stood expressing surprise and wonder, while he found the\r\nkey and opened the heavy lid. They saw it was a tool chest.\r\n\r\nPaul was the first to speak; for when he exhibited the contents, a\r\ndeeper silence seemed to fall upon the women.\r\n\r\n'It's no mistake,' he said to his mother. 'This belongs to August\r\nScheffer. He has lent it to me. Isn't it kind of him? For I told him I\r\nhad to borrow when I worked.'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Paul's mother. 'It's anything but kind. You could waste time\r\nenough in such doings, Paul, without getting a tempter into the house.\r\nWhat do you want of tools? Do you get along with your books so fast you\r\ndon't know what to do with your time? August Scheffer is just like his\r\nfather, he never, as long as he lived, found out the use of money; if he\r\nhad, his wife wouldn't have been left a beggar.'\r\n\r\n'And August would never have been himself,' said Paul. 'That would have\r\nbeen a pity.'\r\n\r\n'No,' said Josephine; 'he would always have been himself.'\r\n\r\n'Don't talk like a simpleton, child. You are old enough to see that\r\nAugust might have been a very different man from what he is, if his\r\nfather before him hadn't always this same ridiculous way of throwing the\r\nmoney he earned about like dust.'\r\n\r\n'Well, mother--' began Paul: he hesitated, but a glance at Josephine\r\ndecided him. 'I can tell you that if Harry Cromwell comes to any good,\r\nyou and every one else will have to thank Scheffer for it.'\r\n\r\nJosephine looked at Paul with serious, curious interest; but he saw that\r\nshe was not greatly excited by what he had said. He looked at his\r\nmother, and resolved to say no more. And by that resolution he would\r\nhave held, but for his mother's words.\r\n\r\n'We shall never hear the end of that,' said she. 'Scheffer's father\r\nsigned for Oliver Cromwell; but what of that? he lost his money. Better\r\nmen have done as much for worse; but I don't know that it deserved to be\r\ntalked of to all generations.'\r\n\r\n'It was a generous act,' said Paul. 'But August has beat his father at\r\nthat, I can tell you, if you want to hear.'\r\n\r\n'Some slander, I suppose,' said the mother. 'I suppose every young man\r\nwithin fifty miles is jealous of Harry; it's well he has gone far enough\r\nto get rid of it all.'\r\n\r\n'Well, mother, keep your good opinion of him. It isn't from Scheffer I\r\nheard it. You don't want to know what a noble fellow he is;' and he\r\nwound up with August's frequent saying, 'it makes no difference.'\r\n\r\n'I want to hear what you are going to do with this box, though,' said\r\nMrs. Mitchell. 'There's not a room in the house big enough to hold it.'\r\n\r\nPaul plead for a corner of his own room; a startling proposal, indeed,\r\nfor those who heard it, the 'room' being hardly an apology for a closet.\r\nHe pleads well, however, for he carried the point, and space was in some\r\nway provided; and Mrs. Mitchell, who had hopes of a future for her\r\nchildren that should throw a glory round their unfolding and her closing\r\nyears, heard the boy say, with, some sort of faith: 'Oh, mother, you\r\ndon't know yet what a genius you've got in your boy;' and when she left\r\nhim he was still laughing over the boast. But Josephine saw that as he\r\nstooped over the chest there were tears in his eyes.\r\n\r\nFor that reason she did not leave him to rejoice alone over his\r\ntreasure. And for the reason that she did not leave him, he said to her,\r\nobserving with what interest she took up one bright tool after another\r\nfrom its place:\r\n\r\n'Scheffer has bought this box for me. You see, don't you, the tools were\r\nnever used before? Not one of them.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Josephine, 'that's easy to be seen.'\r\n\r\n'I must keep them and use them, I suppose!'\r\n\r\n'You intend to do it, Paul. Are you trying to deceive me? Do you suppose\r\nI don't know that of course he had a reason for sending them to you!\r\nPeople are not in the habit of sending such things to boys who don't\r\nknow how to use them.'\r\n\r\n'But, Josephine, I shall pay him for them.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, or else I shall, Paul. But let him enjoy the gift; for I know how\r\nit pleased him to send it.'\r\n\r\n'And I won't serve him as another fellow did, too proud to accept a\r\nfavor of him till he should get beyond sight and sound, so stingy of his\r\nthanks. That's what your Cromwell did! I hate the hateful fellow.'\r\n\r\n'My Cromwell? Did he that?' But Josephine neither swooned, nor cried,\r\nnor blushed; was not overwhelmed with shame, nor indignation, nor\r\ndistress. Some such exhibition, that should be as a confession, Paul had\r\nlooked for, trembling, when the daring deed was done, of exposing a\r\nlover's baseness to the woman he loved.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Paul, cooled somewhat by his sister's calmness. 'I knew I\r\nought to let you know. But I thought I never could. He wouldn't take the\r\nmoney August offered him, but he got it from the bank, on a forged\r\nnote.'\r\n\r\n'Paul!' exclaimed Josephine. The lad looked again at his sister; but he\r\nnow saw through her horrified surprise; there was really no danger in\r\ncontinuing this revelation; elated, he went on:\r\n\r\n'Forged and paid! so the young fellow told me. That's not Scheffer,\r\nunderstand. _He_ don't know that I have got wind of it; he thinks it is\r\nsafe with him; and you never would have known anything but for me!\r\nAugust thinks too much of you, I've found that out, to tell you, or me\r\neither, that Cromwell is a scamp.'\r\n\r\n'What have I to do with all this, Paul?' asked his sister, with a\r\nwell-assumed indifference. She had time now to consider whether she had\r\nnot betrayed too much interest in the affairs of these young men, the\r\nscientific forger and the man of trade.\r\n\r\n'Why,' answered Paul, with no less composure, inwardly rejoicing in what\r\nhe considered his triumph, 'you have to make the best of it, I\r\nsuppose--satisfy mother--marry Cromwell when he comes back, rich as\r\nCroesus, with ship-loads of treasure. That's what the handsome girls are\r\nfor, to marry off to rich men, isn't it?'\r\n\r\nPaul had had his say, but that was his only consolation. Whatever answer\r\nJosephine might have made was prevented by the voice of her mother\r\ncalling from the foot of the stairs. Yet he chose to consider that\r\nsufficient confession, in regard to some of his suspicions, was given in\r\nher words as she went down; though what she said was merely,\r\n\r\n'Paul, if you don't join the detectives, you'll fail of your mission.'\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nScheffer's uniform good luck took a sudden turn one day. The fine row of\r\nbuildings that faced the college grounds took fire one morning, and his\r\nshop was burned with the rest. He saved but little of his stock, and it\r\nwas but recently that he had greatly added to it. His loss was a severe\r\none.\r\n\r\nToward nightfall of that day, Paul looked for Scheffer, and found him in\r\na room to which he had removed the remnants of his goods. He was alone\r\nthere, and trying to come to an understanding with himself, singing\r\nmeanwhile, but, it must be said, in not the most straightforward and\r\nperfectly musical manner.\r\n\r\nPaul came expressly deputed by his mother to bring Scheffer home to tea\r\nwith him. The news of his disaster had set August before her in a\r\ndifferent light from that in which he had stood in the days of his\r\nvulgar prosperity. Calamity restored him to his place again--the son of\r\nan old neighbor, the son of a good woman--one of the heirs of\r\nmisfortune: and who might not have expected this event, that knew in\r\nAugust's veins the Scheffer blood was flowing? Yes; the mother of\r\nJosephine was this day disposed to compassion, helped, may be, to that\r\ngentleness by the letter she had recently received from Cromwell, in\r\nwhich he detailed his successes in a manner that made the heart of the\r\nprophetess to rejoice.\r\n\r\nScheffer hesitated for a moment, only one, over that invitation. But he\r\ndid hesitate. And Paul, the lynx-eyed, saw it. Scheffer might invent\r\nwhatever excuse seemed best to his own kindliness of heart: Paul was\r\nconvinced that his friend felt no confidence in the impulse that had\r\nobtained for him an open door in the house that he had seen, in spite of\r\nJosephine's friendliness, was closed on him all these years.\r\n\r\nPaul did not urge the invitation. Instead, he produced a purse--sole\r\npurse of the house of Mitchell, that had not, in a generation, held as\r\nmany bank notes as this now contained. He put this purse into Scheffer's\r\nhands, and said, moving back from him a pace:\r\n\r\n'That is yours. I knew you fibbed about the tool chest. You had no use\r\nfor it. So we have bought it. Look if I have counted the money right. I\r\nknew you would never tell me the truth about the cost, so I've been to\r\nthe maker, and asked him a civil question. No dodging, Mr. Scheffer.'\r\n\r\nMr. Scheffer did not 'dodge.' He emptied the purse, counted the bills,\r\nput them into his own leather pocket-book; then he handed the purse to\r\nPaul.\r\n\r\nPaul did not expect this. It was plain that he did not. He thought that\r\nScheffer would have 'stood' against receiving the payment for his gift.\r\nHe had said so to Josephine; but Josephine had replied, 'You are\r\nmistaken, Paul. You don't know him, after all. But, if you _are_ right,\r\ninsist on his taking the money. Do not go too far, however. If he should\r\nseem to be offended, bring it back to me, and I will attend to it.'\r\n\r\n_Was_ he offended? Paul was in doubt. The doubt made him desperate, and\r\nhe exclaimed:\r\n\r\n'I meant that for a present. Josephine worked it.'\r\n\r\nScheffer's eye fell on the light and pretty trifle; a change came over\r\nhim. He would have struggled hard and long before he would have\r\nsurrendered that little tissue of floss, but now less than vanity to\r\nhim. 'Josephine worked it.' What are words?\r\n\r\n'I suppose,' he began; but he did not conclude what he had on his\r\ntongue; he did _not_ say to Paul that he supposed it was Josephine's\r\nmoney too--her earnings--that paid for the chest.\r\n\r\nThere came an awkward silence into the confused and dismal room.\r\nScheffer stood among his ruins, not like a ruined man: he could not\r\ntalk, however. He could say nothing whatever in continuance, about the\r\nfire. It was never his habit to boast; as little his practice to lament.\r\n\r\n'Paul,' he said at last, resuming his dismal endeavor to arrange and\r\nassort the chaotic remnant of his goods, 'I got your box under weigh\r\nlast night. There's a friend of mine going to see it; and you needn't be\r\nworrying on account of this--this fire; for I shall have money enough to\r\npush your business pretty soon; and there are two good fellows standing\r\nready to buy your rights to the patent in this State, on your own terms,\r\nI guess, if you are tolerably reasonable. You can have five thousand\r\ndollars, if you will be easy with them about the payments. They are as\r\nsafe as the best in town. I settled all that last night. All you have to\r\ndo is to come to an agreement.'\r\n\r\nPaul's heart beat as fast as any young man's heart beats when the result\r\nof secret toil, of wakeful nights, and patient endurance of home\r\nmisconception, is before him in the form of honorable success. But\r\ninstead of thanks, these words escaped him in a tumult:\r\n\r\n'Scheffer, have you heard the news from Cromwell?'\r\n\r\nScheffer considered ere he answered; he was puzzled, looking at Paul,\r\nsuch a contradiction and confusion of signs he read in the lad's face.\r\n\r\n'I heard that your family had great tidings from him,' he answered\r\nfinally.\r\n\r\n'He is dead!'\r\n\r\n'Poor Josephine!'\r\n\r\nWhat was it that brought so low the head of the man who had stood all\r\nday bravely erect, enduring the condolence of people, sustaining himself\r\nin the shock of integrity? Scheffer sat down when he heard this news,\r\nand wept.\r\n\r\nAnd Paul wept with him. There, in that chamber of ruins, they deplored\r\nthe loss of the proud, ambitious, brilliant, and dishonest wordling, who\r\nhad long ago gone out of _their_ world with a lie on his soul.\r\n\r\nThen Paul produced the foreign letter he had brought with him from the\r\nmail, as he came in his search for Scheffer. The letter he read aloud.\r\nIt was written by one of Harry's fellow students, his companion in that\r\nnotable journey Cromwell made to the Ural, and the Zavods of Siberia. He\r\nhad returned to Paris, and thence had written of his various successes\r\nto his friends: they knew it was his purpose to sail at once for\r\nAlexandria. His preparations, wrote this correspondent, were complete;\r\nbut, on the day when the vessel sailed, he died--sickened and died in\r\none morning; his disease was of the heart.\r\n\r\n'Poor Josephine!' groaned August again; this time his pity had comment.\r\n\r\n'It's awful!' said Paul. 'Josephine cried when she heard of your\r\nmisfortune. She won't do more when she sees this letter.' Paul was\r\nentirely reckless of consequences. He was determined Scheffer's fire\r\nshould serve a private purpose of illumination, 'It is so rare a thing,\r\nher crying,' he continued, 'I should have thought the fire would have\r\nbeen put out by it.'\r\n\r\nScheffer's tears ceased falling. But he spoke in a low voice, somewhat\r\nbroken, too:\r\n\r\n'It's enough to wipe out _my_ regrets. If she cared that much, I don't\r\nconsider it a misfortune. Tell her so, Paul.'\r\n\r\n'I will, after you have told her yourself, Scheffer,' said Paul. Then\r\ncasting all their fortunes on a word, speaking hurriedly, impetuously,\r\ndriven on by admiration and gratitude toward Scheffer, and a\r\ndetermination to end all misunderstandings at once and forever, he\r\ncontinued: 'I found it all out, myself, without prying. The young fellow\r\nin the bank told me. I knew that you never would. It made me love you,\r\nthat did. I told Josephine, but not till I thought I might safely. He\r\ndidn't get that money from the bank till Josephine had told him she\r\ncould not promise herself to him before he went away. Poor fellow! It\r\nmade him mad, I think.'\r\n\r\n'Paul,' said Scheffer, with reproof, and yet the mildest, in his voice,\r\n'he is dead. That was an ugly twist, but it wasn't his nature to grow in\r\na crooked fashion. Harry will come out straight yet. He is in better\r\ncircumstances now than ever before. I could forgive a man for worse\r\nthings than he had the wit to do, if he loved Josephine.'\r\n\r\n'There! I'm glad we are back on that ground! I hate mysteries,'\r\nexclaimed Paul.\r\n\r\n'Except in locks,' said Scheffer.\r\n\r\n'Why _wouldn't_ she promise Harry? It is what mother expected. And I was\r\nfool enough to wonder. You are wiser than we; so tell me, Scheffer, did\r\nanything ever happen in old times that binds her yet? Do you suppose she\r\never loved a lad when she was a child?'\r\n\r\n'I know she did,' said Scheffer, looking not away from Paul, neither\r\nbusying himself any longer with the endeavor to bring order out of\r\nchaos. 'I know she did.'\r\n\r\nThen Paul laughed again, as he had not laughed in many a day; but it was\r\nlaughter that did not jar the silence of the room--such laughter as\r\nformed a fit prelude for words like these:\r\n\r\n'Find out if the lad is alive yet. There is a piece of business worthy\r\nof Scheffer himself! I'm tired of hunting out secrets. Promise me,\r\nAugust--promise before you leave this room--before you breathe again.'\r\n\r\nScheffer did.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mitchell waited tea that evening for at least an hour. Josephine\r\nwas sure that if August could be found, Paul would bring him home. At\r\nlast they came. Home at last! The darkness might besiege the house, it\r\ncould not enter the hearts there; rain might fall on Scheffer's ruins,\r\nit could not prevent the rising of the Phoenix. Not recognized\r\naltogether as the household's eldest son, he stood under the roof of the\r\nlittle house on Cottage Row. But enough! he was satisfied: he saw two\r\nwomen smiling on him--one from her heart. And from the circle that night\r\nPaul, triumphant and joyful, excluded the vision of death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAS ORACIONES.\r\n\r\n  I moved among the moving multitude\r\n  In old Manila, when the afternoon\r\n  Releases labor, and the scorching skies\r\n  Are tempered with the coming on of night.\r\n  Above the 'ever loyal city,' rose\r\n  The surging sound of unloosed tongues and feet,\r\n  As the encompassed town and suburbs vast,\r\n  The boated river and the sentinelled bridge\r\n  Swarmed, parti-colored, with the populace.\r\n  The sovereign sun, that through the toilsome day\r\n  No eye had seen for brightness, now subdued,\r\n  Stepping, like Holy Pontiff, from his throne,\r\n  Neared to the people, and, with level rays,\r\n  As hands outstretching, benedictions shed.\r\n  Full the effulgence flashed upon the walls\r\n  Which girt the city with a strength renowned,\r\n  Rimming them with new glory: bright it gleamed\r\n  Upon the swarthy soldiery, as they filed\r\n  A dazzling phalanx through the gaping crowd\r\n  With martial intonation, and it played\r\n  Softly upon the evening-breathing throng\r\n  On the Calsada's broad and dashing drive,\r\n  On gay, armorial equipage, wherein\r\n  Dozed dowagers: on unbonneted dames\r\n  In open chariots, toying daintily\r\n  With dark hidalgos, as they sipped the scene\r\n  In languishing contentment, and between\r\n  Responsive glances, showing hidden fire,\r\n  With fluent breath of Spanish repartee.\r\n  There lounged senoras, fat officials' wives,\r\n  From their soft cushions casting cool disdain\r\n  On the mestiza, who, in hired hack,\r\n  Blooming in beauty of commingled blood,\r\n  And robed in slippery tissue, rainbow-bright,\r\n  Sat, in her sandal-footed grace, a queen\r\n  Among her fellows, they who yesterday\r\n  Whirled her lithe figure in the tireless dance,\r\n  And now, with airy compliment, kept bright\r\n  The flame she yet may quench in wedlock dull.\r\n  Thus rolled the wealthy in their liveried ease,\r\n  'Mid walking peasantry and pale Chinese,\r\n  And curious-shirted Creole; while, tight swathed\r\n  Up to their shrivelled features, mummy like,\r\n  The Indian women filled the motley scene.\r\n  Meanwhile, the sovereign sun had crowned the palms\r\n  Standing in stately clusters; and from thence\r\n  Scaled the high walls and climbed the citadel,\r\n  Pouring a parting radiance on the tower\r\n  Of San Sebastian: mounting to its goal,\r\n  It swept the public dial plate and lay,\r\n  E'en in the face of stern recording time\r\n  Smiling significance; thence slowly crept\r\n  Up to the turret, blazing, momently,\r\n  Thence reached the dizzy ball; and, last of all,\r\n  Kissed with its dying lips the sacred cross.\r\n\r\n  Then pealed the solemn vesper bell to prayer,\r\n  And suddenly--completely--with a hush,\r\n  As if a god-like voice had stricken it dead,\r\n  Stood still the city!\r\n\r\n                           Motionless the life\r\n  That but an instant off stirred the warm air\r\n  With murmurs multifarious, and the waves\r\n  Of great humanity, sunk silenced there,\r\n  With stillness so supreme, that pulses beat\r\n  More quickly from the contrast, and the soul\r\n  Hearkened to listen, humbled and subdued\r\n  As when the Saviour uttered 'Peace, be still.'\r\n  The tardy laborer, walled within the town,\r\n  Brought the uplifted hammer noiseless down,\r\n  And stood in meek confession, tool in hand.\r\n  The mother hushed the baby lullaby,\r\n  And o'er her sleeping innocence exhaled\r\n  Voiceless thanksgiving. Children ceased to play,\r\n  Feeling an awe they comprehended not,\r\n  And stood, unconscious of their beauty's pose,\r\n  As those Murillo's pencil glorifies.\r\n  Upon the airy esplanade the steed\r\n  No longer pawed the air in wantonness,\r\n  But, like his compeer of the fabled song,\r\n  Stood statued with his rider, while below\r\n  The beggar ceased his cry importunate,\r\n  And to a Higher Almoner than man\r\n  Sent up a dumb appeal. In folly's court\r\n  The laugh was hushed, and the half-uttered jest\r\n  Fell witless into air, and burning thought\r\n  Cooled, as it flowed, unmoulded into speech.\r\n  As throbbed the distant bell with serious pause,--\r\n  Standing bareheaded in the dewless air,\r\n  Or prostrate in their penitence to earth,\r\n  Or bending with veiled lids,--the people prayed.\r\n  Then was that moment, in its muteness, worth\r\n  The laboring day that bore it, for all sense\r\n  Seemed filtered of its grossness; what was earth\r\n  Sunk settling with the dust to earth again,\r\n  As through the calm, pure atmosphere, arose\r\n  One mingling meditation unto Heaven.\r\n  Oh, beautiful is silence, when it falls\r\n  On housed assemblies bowed in voiceless prayer:\r\n  But when it lays its finger on the heart\r\n  Of a great city, stilling all the wheels\r\n  Of life's employment, that to Heaven may turn\r\n  Its many thousand reverend breathing souls\r\n  With gesture simultaneous; when proud man\r\n  Like multitudinous marble, moveless stands\r\n  With God communing, then does silence seem,\r\n  In its unworded eloquence, sublime.\r\n  Therein, doth Romish worship point rebuke\r\n  To him who doth ignore it, for therein\r\n  It rises to a majesty of praise\r\n  O'erspanning huge cathedrals, for it makes\r\n  The censer, candle, rosary, and book\r\n  But senseless mockeries.\r\n\r\n                                So sunk the sun\r\n  Till on its amber throne, like drapery doffed,\r\n  Lay piled th' imperial purple. Then the stir\r\n  Of an awakened world swept through the crowd,\r\n  As forest leaves are wind-swept after lulls,\r\n  And, with the sense of a renewing joy,\r\n  The murmurous people turned them to their homes.\r\n\r\n  MANILA, 1856.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY MARYLAND!\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEPTEMBER RAID.\r\n\r\n  They took thy boots, they took thy coats,\r\n              My Maryland!\r\n  And paid for them in 'Confed' notes,\r\n              My Maryland!\r\n  They gobbled down thy corn like goats,\r\n  And rooted up thy truck like shoats,\r\n  But then--they didn't get thy votes\r\n              Or volunteers--my Maryland!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MERCHANT'S STORY.\r\n\r\n  'All of which I saw, and part of which I was.'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nOn the cleared plot in front of the store were assembled, as I have\r\nsaid, about a hundred men, women, and children, witnessing a 'turkey\r\nmatch.' It was a motley gathering. All classes and colors and ages were\r\nthere. The young gentleman who boasted his hundred darkies, and the\r\nsmall planter who worked in the field with his five negroes; the 'poor\r\ntrash' who scratched a bare subsistence from a sorry patch of beans and\r\n'collards,' and the swearing, staggering bully who did not condescend to\r\ndo anything; the young child that could scarcely walk alone, and the old\r\nman who could hardly stand upright; the brawny field hand who had toiled\r\nover night to finish his task in time for 'de shootin;' and the\r\nwell-dressed body servant who had roused 'young massa oncommon airly'\r\nfor the same purpose; all, white, black, and yellow--and some neither\r\nwhite, black, nor yellow--were there; scattered over various parts of\r\nthe ground, engaged in lounging, playing, drinking, smoking, chewing,\r\nchatting, swearing, wrangling, and looking on at the turkey match.\r\n\r\nA live turkey was fastened to an ordinary bean pole, in a remote quarter\r\nof the ground, and when I emerged from the cabin, seven or eight\r\n'natives' had entered for 'a shot.' The payment of a 'bit,' 'cash down,'\r\nto Tom, who officiated as master of ceremonies, secured a chance of\r\nhitting the turkey's head with a rifle bullet at 'long distance.' Any\r\nother 'hit' was considered 'foul,' and passed for nothing. Whoever shot\r\nthe mark took the prize, and was expected to 'treat the crowd.' As 'the\r\ncrowd' seemed a thirsty one, it struck me that turkey would prove\r\nexpensive eating to the fortunate shots; but they were oblivious to\r\nexpense, and in a state of mind that unfitted them for close financial\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\nNearly every marksman present had 'carried off his poultry,' and Tom had\r\nalready reaped a harvest of dimes from the whiskey drinking. 'Why, bless\r\nye,' he said to me, 'I should be broke, clean done up, if it warn't fur\r\nthe drinks; I haint got more'n a bit, or three fips, fur nary a fowl;\r\nthe fust shot allers brings down the bird; they're all cocksure on the\r\ntrigger--ary man on 'em kin hit a turkey's eye at a hundred paces.' This\r\nwas true; and in such schools were trained the unerring marksmen who are\r\nnow 'bringing down' the bravest youth of our country, like fowls at a\r\nturkey match.\r\n\r\nA disturbance had broken out on a remote part of the ground, and,\r\nnoticing about twenty negro men and women seated on a log near by, I\r\nwent in that direction, in hopes of meeting the negro trader. It was a\r\ndog fight. Inside an imaginary ring about ten feet in diameter, two dogs\r\nwere clenched in what seemed a life-and-death struggle. One was holding\r\nthe other down by the lower jaw, while a man, evidently the owner of the\r\nhalf-vanquished brute, was trying to separate them. Outside this ring\r\nabout twenty other brutes--men, women, and children--were cheering the\r\ncombatants, and calling on the meddler to desist. It was strange how the\r\npeacemaker managed to stand up against the volleys of oaths they\r\nshowered on him; he did, however, and persisted in his laudable efforts,\r\ntill a tall, rawboned, heavy-jawed fellow stepped into the ring, and,\r\ntaking him by the collar, pulled him away, saying: 'Let 'em be--it's a\r\nfair fight; d---- yer pictur--let 'em alone.'\r\n\r\n'Take thet! you whelp,' said the other, planting a heavy blow between\r\nthe intruder's eyes. Blow followed blow; they clenched; went down; rose\r\nup; fought on--at one end of the ring the canines, at the other the\r\nhumans; while the rest looked on, shouting, 'Let 'er rip! Go in, Wade!\r\nHit 'im agin! Smash his mug! Pluck the grizzly! Hurrah fur Smith! Drown\r\nhis peepers! Never say die! Go in agin!' till the blood flowed, and dogs\r\nand men rolled over on the ground together.\r\n\r\nDisgusted with this exhibition of nineteenth-century civilization, I\r\nturned and walked away. As I did so, I noticed, following me at a short\r\ndistance, a well-dressed man of about thirty-five. He wore a slouched\r\nhat, a gray coat and lower garments, and enormous high-top boots, to one\r\nof which was affixed a brass spur. Over his shoulder, holding the two\r\nends in his hands, he carried a strong, flexible whip, silver mounted,\r\nand polished like patent leather. He was about six feet high, stoutly\r\nbuilt, with a heavy, inexpressive face, and a clear, sharp gray eye. One\r\nglance satisfied me that he was the negro trader.\r\n\r\nAs he approached he held out his hand in a free, hearty way, saying:\r\n'Cunnel, good evenin'.'\r\n\r\n'Good evenin',' I replied, intentionally adopting his accent; 'but yer\r\nwrong, stranger; I'm nary cunnel.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Major, then?'\r\n\r\n'No, Gin'ral; not even a sargint.'\r\n\r\n'Then ye're _Squire_----,' and he hesitated for me to fill up the blank.\r\n\r\n'No; not even Squire----,' I added, laughing. 'I've nary title; I'm\r\nplain _Mister_ Kirke; nothin' else.'\r\n\r\n'Well, _Mister_ Kirke, ye're the fust man I've met in the hull Suthern\r\ncountry who wus jest nobody at all; and drot me ef I doan't like ye\r\nfor't. Ev'ry d----d little upstart, now-a-days, has a handle ter his\r\nname--they all b'long ter the nobility, ha! ha!' and he again brought\r\nhis hand down upon mine with a concussion that made the woods ring.\r\n\r\n'Come,' he added; 'let's take a drink.'\r\n\r\n'Glad ter drink with ye, stranger; but I karn't go Tom's sperrets--it's\r\nhard ter take.'\r\n\r\n'That's a fact, but I keeps the raal stuff. That's the pizen fur ye;' he\r\nreplied, holding up a small willow flask, and starting toward the bar.\r\nEntering a cloud of tobacco smoke, and groping our way over groups of\r\ndrunken chivalry, who lay 'loosely around,' we approached the counter.\r\n\r\n'Har, you lousy sorrel-top,' said the trader to the red-faced and\r\nred-headed bar tender; 'har, give us some mugs.'\r\n\r\n'Sorrel-top' placed two glasses on the counter, and my new acquaintance\r\nproceeded to rinse them thoroughly. They were of a clear grass-green\r\ncolor, and holding one up to the light, the trader said: 'Now luk a'\r\nthem. Them's 'bout as green as the fellers that drink out on 'em--a\r\nman's stumac's got ter be of cast iron ter stand the stuff they sell\r\nhar.'\r\n\r\n'It's better'n you kin 'ford ter drink,' exclaimed the bar tender, in\r\nhigh dudgeon.\r\n\r\n'Who spoke ter ye--take thet!' rejoined the trader, discharging the\r\ncontents of the glass full in the man's face. The sorrel-crowned worthy\r\nbore the indignity silently, evidently deeming discretion the better\r\npart of valor.\r\n\r\n'Buy'n ony nigs, Kirke?' said the trader, inserting his arm in mine, and\r\nleading me away from the shanty: 'I've got a prime lot--_prime_;' and he\r\nsmacked his lips together at the last word, in the manner that is common\r\nto professional liquor tasters. He scented a trade afar off, and his\r\norgans of taste, sympathizing with his olfactories, gave out that token\r\nof satisfaction.\r\n\r\n'Well, I doan't know. What ye got?'\r\n\r\n'Some o' the likeliest property ye ever seed--men and wimmin. All bought\r\nround har; haint ben ter Virginny yit. Come 'long, I'll show ye;' and he\r\nproceeded toward the group of chattels. He was becoming altogether too\r\nfamiliar, but I called to mind a favorite maxim of good old Mr.\r\nRussell--_Necessitus non arbit legum_--and quietly submitted.\r\n\r\nThe negroes were seated on a fallen pine, in a remote quarter of the\r\nground, and were chained together by the wrists, in gangs of four or\r\nfive, the outside one having one hand secured by a cord bound about the\r\nwaist. The men wore woollen hats, and the women neat Madras turbans, and\r\nboth had thick linsey clothing, warm enough for any weather. Their dusky\r\nfaces were sleek and oily, and their kinky locks combed as straight as\r\nnature would permit. The trader had 'rigged them up,' as a jockey 'rigs\r\nup' his horses for market.\r\n\r\nPausing before a brawny specimen of the yellow species, he said: 'Thar,\r\nKirke, luk o' thar; thar's a boy fur ye--a nig thet kin work--'tend ten\r\nthousand boxes (turpentine) easy. He's the sort. Prime stuff\r\n_thet_--(feeling of his arms and thighs)--hard--hard as rock--siners\r\nlike rope. Come o' good stock, he did--the old Devereaux blood--(a\r\nhighly respectable family in those parts)--they's the raal quality--none\r\non yer shams or mushrooms; but genuwine 'stockracy--blamed if they\r\nhaint. What d'ye say ter him?'\r\n\r\n'Well, he moight do, p'raps--but I rather reckon ye've done him up sum;\r\n'iled his face, greased his wool, and sech like. It's all right, ye\r\nknow--onything's far in trade; but ye karn't come it over me, ole\r\nfeller. I'm up ter sech doin's. I _am_, Mr.----,' and I paused for him\r\nto finish the sentence.\r\n\r\n'Larkin,' he added quickly and good-humoredly; 'Jake Larkin, and yours,\r\nby----,' and he gave my hand another shake. 'Yer one on 'em, I swar, and\r\nI own up; I _hev_ 'iled em' a trifle--jest a trifle; but ye kin see\r\nthrough thet; we hev ter do it ter fix the green 'uns, ye knows.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I knows--'iled 'em inside and out, haint ye?'\r\n\r\n'No, on my soul--only one glass ter day--true as preachin'.'\r\n\r\n'Boy,' I said to the yellow man, 'how much whiskey hev ye drunk ter day?\r\nNow, tell the truth.'\r\n\r\n'Nary drop, massa; hed a moufful o' _sperrets_--a berry little\r\nmoufful--dat's all.'\r\n\r\n'Taint 'nough, Larkin! Come, now, doan't be mean with nigs. Give 'em sum\r\nmore--sum o' thet tall brandy o' your'n; a good swig. They karn't stand\r\nit out har in the cold without a little warmin' up.'\r\n\r\n'Well, I'm blamed ef I won't. Har, you, Jim,' speaking to a well-dressed\r\ndarky standing near. 'Har, go ter thet red-headed woodpecker, thar at\r\nthe cabin, and tell him I'll smash his peepers if he doan't send me sum\r\nglasses ter onst--d'ye har? Go.'\r\n\r\nThe gentlemanly darky went, and soon returned with the glassware; and\r\nmeanwhile Larkin directed another well-clad negro man to 'bring the\r\njugs.' They were strung across the back of a horse which was tied near,\r\nand, uncorking one of them, the trader said: 'I allers carry my own\r\npizen. 'Taint right to give even nigs sech hell-fire as they sell round\r\nhar; it git's a feller's stumac used ter tophet 'fore the rest on him is\r\n'climated.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it does,' I replied; 'it's the devil's own warming pan.'\r\n\r\nEach negro received a fair quantity of the needed beverage, and seemed\r\nthe better for it. A little brandy, 'for the stomach's sake,' is enjoyed\r\nby those dusky denizens of the low latitudes.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all supplied, the trader said to me: 'Now, what d'ye say,\r\nKirke? What'll ye give fur the boy?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I reckon I doan't want no boys jest now; and I doan't know as I\r\nwants ary 'ooman nother; but if ye've got a right likely gal--one\r\nthet'll sew, and nuss good--I moight buy her fur a friend o' mine. His\r\nwife's hed twins, and he moight use her ter look arter the young 'uns.'\r\n\r\n'Young or old?'\r\n\r\n'Young and sprightly.'\r\n\r\n'They is high, ye knows--but thar's a gal that'll suit. Git up gals;'\r\nand a row of five women rose: 'No; git up thar, whar we kin see ye.'\r\nThey stepped up on the log. 'Now, thar's a gal fur ye,' he continued,\r\npointing to a clean, tidy mulatto woman, not more than nineteen, with a\r\nhandsome but meek, sorrow-marked face: 'Luk at thet!' and he threw up\r\nher dress to her knees, while the poor girl reached down her shackled\r\nhands in the vain effort to prevent the indignity. He was about to show\r\noff other good points, when I said: 'Never mind--I see what she is. Let\r\n'em git down.'\r\n\r\nThey resumed their seats, and he continued: 'Thet's jest the gal ye\r\nwants, Kirke--good at nussin', wet or dry; good at breedin', too; hed\r\ntwo young 'uns, a'ready. Ye kin * * * * *' [The rest of this discourse\r\nwill not bear repeating.]\r\n\r\n'No, thank you.'\r\n\r\n'Well, jest as ye say. She's sound, though; sold fur no fault. Har young\r\nmassa's ben a-usin' on har--young 'uns are his'n. Old man got pious;\r\ncouldn't stand sech doin's no how--ter home--so he says ter me, 'Jake,\r\nsays he, take har ter Orleans--she's jest the sort--ye'll make money\r\nsellin' har ter some o' them young bloods. Ha! ha! thet's religion for\r\nye! I doan't know, Kirke, mebbe ye b'long ter the church, and p'raps yer\r\none o' the screamin' sort; but any how, I say, d---- sech religion as\r\nthet. Jake Larkin's a spec'lator, but he wouldn't do a thing like\r\nthet--ef he would, d---- him.'\r\n\r\n[The dealer in negroes never applies the term 'trader' to himself; he\r\nprefers the softer word, 'speculator.' The phrase 'negro trader' is used\r\nonly by the rest of the community, who are 'holier than he.']\r\n\r\n'I doan't b'lieve ye would, Larkin; yer a good fellow, at bottom, I\r\nreckon.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Kirke, yer a trump. Come, hev another drink.'\r\n\r\n'No; excuse me; karn't stand more'n one horn a day: another'd lay me out\r\nflatter'n a stewpan. But ter business. How much fur thet gal--cash down?\r\nCome, talk it out.'\r\n\r\n'Well, at a word--twelve hun'red.'\r\n\r\n'Too much; bigger'n my pile; couldn't put so much inter one gal, nohow.\r\nWouldn't give thet money fur ary nig in Car'lina.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, buy me, good massa. Mister Larkin'll take less'n dat, I reckon;\r\n_do_ buy me,' said the girl, who had been eying me very closely during\r\nthe preceding dialogue.\r\n\r\n'I would, my good girl, if I could; but you'll not exactly suit my\r\nfriend.'\r\n\r\n'Buy har fur yourself, then, Kirke. She'd suit you. She's sound, I tell\r\nye--ye'd make money on har.'\r\n\r\n'Not much, I reckon,' I replied, dryly.\r\n\r\n'Why not? She'll breed like a rabbit.' * * * * *\r\n\r\n'I wouldn't own her for the whole State: if I had her, I'd free her on\r\nthe spot!' The cool bestiality of the trader disgusted me, and I forgot\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nHe started back surprised; then quietly remarked: 'Ye're a Nutherner, I\r\nswar; no corncracker ever held sech doctrines as them.'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' I replied, dropping the accent, which my blunder had rendered\r\nuseless; 'I _am_ a Northerner; but I want a nurse, notwithstanding, for\r\na friend.'\r\n\r\n'Whar d'ye live?' asked the trader, in the same free, good-natured tone\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n'In New York.'\r\n\r\n'In York! What! Yer not Mr. Kirke, of Randall, Kirke & Co.? But,\r\nblamenation, ye _ar_! How them whiskers has altered ye! I _thort_ I'd\r\nseed ye afore. Haint ye come it over me slick? Tuk in clean, swallered\r\nhull. But thar's my hand, Mr. Kirke; I'm right glad ter see ye.'\r\n\r\n'Where have you met me, my good fellow? I don't remember _you_.'\r\n\r\n'Down ter Orleans. Seed ye inter Roye, Struthers & Co.'s. The ole man\r\nthinks a heap o' you; ye give 'em a pile of business, doan't ye.'\r\n\r\n'No, not much of our own. They buy cotton for our English\r\ncorrespondents, and negotiate through us, that is all. Roye is a fine\r\nold gentleman.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, he ar; I'm in with him.'\r\n\r\n'How _in_ with him?'\r\n\r\n'Why, in this business--we go snacks; I do the buyin', and he finds the\r\nrocks. We use a pile--sometimes a hun'red, sometimes two hun'red\r\nthousand.'\r\n\r\n'Is it possible! Then you do a large business?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, right smart; I handle 'bout a thousand--big and little--ev'ry\r\nyear.'\r\n\r\n'That _is_ large. You do not buy and sell them all, yourself, do you?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, no? I hardly ever sells; once in a while I run agin a buyer--_like\r\nyou_--ha! ha!--and let one drap; but gin'rally I cage 'em, and when I\r\ngit 'bout a hun'red together, I take 'em ter Orleans, and auction 'em\r\noff. Thar's no fuss and dicker 'bout thet, ye knows.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I know! But how do you manage so large a gang? I should think some\r\nwould get away.'\r\n\r\n'No, they doan't. I put the ribands on 'em; and, 'sides, ye see them\r\nboys, thar?' pointing to three splendid specimens of property, loitering\r\nnear; 'I've hed them boys nigh on ter ten year, and I haint lost nary a\r\nnig sense I had 'em. They're cuter and smarter nor I am, any day.'\r\n\r\n'Then you pick the negroes up round the country, and send them to a\r\nrendezvous, where you put them in jail till you make up your number?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, the boys takes 'em down ter the pen. I'm pickin' sum up round har,\r\nnow, ye see, and I send 'em ter Goldsboro'. When I've toted these down\r\nthar, the boys and I'll go up ter Virginny.'\r\n\r\n'Why don't you send them on by stage? I should think it would hurt them\r\nto camp out at this season.'\r\n\r\n'Hurt 'em! Lord bless ye, fresh air never hurt a nig; they're never so\r\nhappy as sleepin' on the groun', with nothin' over 'em, and thar heels\r\nclose ter a light-wood fire.'\r\n\r\n'But the delicate house women and the children, can they bear it?'\r\n\r\n'It do come a trifle hard on them, but it doan't last long. I allers\r\ntakes ter the railroad when I gets a gang together.'\r\n\r\n'Well, come; I want a woman. Show me all you have.'\r\n\r\n'Do ye mean so, raally, Mr. Kirke? I thort ye wus a comin' it on me, and\r\nI swar ye does do the Suthern like a native. I'm blamed ef I didn't\r\ns'pose ye b'longed round har. Ha! ha! How the ole man would larf ter\r\nhear it!'\r\n\r\n'But I _am_ a native, Larkin; born within sight of Bunker Hill.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, thet kind o' native; and them's the sort, too. They make all-fired\r\nsmart spec'lators. I knows a dozen on 'em, thet hev made thar pile, and\r\nhaint older'n I am, nother.'\r\n\r\n'Is it possible! Yankees in this business?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, lots on 'em. Some on yer big folks up ter York and Bostin are in\r\nit deep; but they go the 'portin' line, gin'rally, and thet--d--d if\r\n_I'd_ do it, anyhow.'\r\n\r\n'Well, about the woman. None of these will do; are they all you have?'\r\n\r\n'No, I've got one more, but I've sort o' 'lotted har ter a young feller\r\ndown ter Orleans. He told me ter git him jest sech a gal. She's 'most\r\nwhite, and brought up tender like, and them kind is high prized, ye\r\nknows.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I know; but where is she--let me see her?'\r\n\r\n'She's in the store;' and rising, he led the way to the shanty.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the part of the ground where the marksmen were\r\nstationed, we found an altercation going on between Tom and a young\r\nplanter. It appeared that the young man had paid for a shot, and\r\ninsisted on his body servant taking his place in the lists. To that Tom,\r\nand the stout yeomen who had entered for the turkey, objected, on\r\naccount of the yellow man's station and complexion.\r\n\r\nThe young gentleman was dressed in the highest style of fashion, and,\r\nthough not more than nineteen, was evidently a 'blood' of 'the very\r\nfirst water.' The body servant was a good-looking quadroon, and sported\r\nan enormous diamond pin and a heavy gold watch chain. In his sleek\r\nbeaver hat, and nicely-brushed suit of black broadcloth, he looked a\r\nmuch better-dressed gentleman than any one on the ground.\r\n\r\nAs we approached, Tom, every pimple on his red face swelling with\r\nvirtuous indignation, was delivering himself of the following harangue:\r\n\r\n'We doan't put ourselfs on a futtin' with niggers, Mr. Gaston. We doan't\r\nkeer if they do b'long ter kid-gloved 'ristocrats like ye is; they\r\nkarn't come in har, no how! Ye'd better go home. Ye orter be in better\r\nbusiness then prowlin' round shootin' matches, with yer scented,\r\nbedevilled-up buck niggers. Go home, and wash the smell out o' yer\r\ncloes. Yer d----d muskmelon (Tom's word for musk) makes ye smell jest\r\nlike hurt skunks; and ye ar skunks, clar through ter the innards. Whew!\r\nClar eöut, I tell ye!'\r\n\r\nThe young man's face reddened. The blood of the chivalry was rising. He\r\nreplied:\r\n\r\n'Keep a civil tongue in your head, you thieving scoundrel; if you don't,\r\nthe next time I catch you trading with my nigs, I'll see you get a\r\nhundred lashes; d----d if I don't.'\r\n\r\nTom bade him go to a very warm latitude, and denied trading with\r\nnegroes.\r\n\r\n'You lie, you sneaking whelp; you've got the marks on your back now, for\r\ndealing with Pritchett's.'\r\n\r\nTom returned the lie, when the young man's face grew a trifle redder,\r\nand his whip rising in the air, it fell across Tom's nose in a very\r\nuncomfortable manner--for Tom. The liquor vender reeled, but, recovering\r\nhimself in a moment, he aimed a heavy blow at the young gentleman's\r\nfrontispiece. That 'parlor ornament' would have been sadly disfigured,\r\nhad not the darky caught the stroke on his left arm, and at the same\r\nmoment planted what the 'profession' call a 'wiper,' just behind Tom's\r\nleft ear. Tom's private dram shop went down--'caved in'--was 'laid out\r\nsprawling;' and two or three minutes elapsed before it got on its legs\r\nagain. When it did, it frothed at the mouth like a mug of ale with too\r\nmuch head on it.\r\n\r\nThey were not more than six paces apart, when Tom rose, and drawing a\r\ndouble-barrelled pistol from his pocket, aimed it at the planter. The\r\nlatter was in readiness for him. His six-shooter was level with Tom's\r\nbreast, and his hand on the trigger, when, just as he seemed ready to\r\nfire, the negro trader coolly stepped before him, and twisted the weapon\r\nfrom his hand. Turning then to Tom, Larkin said, 'Now, you clar out.\r\nMake tracks, or I'll lamm ye like blamenation. Be off, I tell ye,' he\r\nadded as Tom showed an unwillingness to move. 'A sensible man like ye\r\narn't a gwine ter waste good powder on sech a muskrat sort of a thing as\r\nthis is, is ye? Come, clar!' and he placed his hand on Tom's shoulder,\r\nand accelerated his rather slow movements toward the groggery. Returning\r\nthen to the young man, he said:\r\n\r\n'And now you, Mr. Gustavus Adolphus Pocahontas Powhatan Gaston, s'pose\r\n_you_ clar out, too?'\r\n\r\n'I shall go when I please--not before,' said Mr. Gaston.\r\n\r\n'You'll please mighty sudden, then, _I_ reckon. A young man of your\r\nedication should be 'bout better business than gittin' inter brawls with\r\nlow groggery keepers, and 'sultin' decent white folks with your\r\nscented-up niggers. Yer a disgrace ter yer good ole father, and them as\r\nwas afore him. With yer larnin' and money ye moight be doin' suthin' fur\r\nthem as is below ye; but instead o' thet, yer doin' nothin' but hangin'\r\nround bar rooms, gittin' drunk, playin' cards, drivin' fast hosses, and\r\nkeepin' nigger wimmin. I'm ashamed o' ye. Yer gwine straight ter hell,\r\nye is; and the hull country's gwine thar, too, 'cause it's raisin' a\r\ncrap of jest sech idle, no-account, blusterin', riproaring young fools\r\nas you is. Now, go home. Make tracks ter onst, or I'll hev thet d----d\r\nnigger's neck o' your'n stretched fur strikin' a white man, I will! Ye\r\nknows me, and I'll do it, as sure's my name's Jake Larkin.'\r\n\r\nThe young planter listened rather impatiently to this harangue, but said\r\nnothing. When it was concluded, he told his servant to bring up the\r\nhorses; and then turning to the trader, said:\r\n\r\n'Well, Right Reverend Mr. Larkin, you'll please to make yourself scarce\r\naround the plantation in future. If you come near it, just remember that\r\nwe _keep dogs_, and that we use them for chasing--_niggers_.' The last\r\nword was emphasized in a way that showed he classed Larkin with the\r\nwares he dealt in.\r\n\r\n'Yer father, young man, is a honest man, and a gentleman. He knows I'm\r\none, if I _do_ trade in niggers; and he'll want ter see me when I want\r\nter come.'\r\n\r\nThe negro by this time had brought up the horses. 'Good evening, Mr.\r\nLarkin,' said young Hopeful, as he mounted and rode off.\r\n\r\n'Good evenin', replied the trader, coolly, but respectfully.\r\n\r\n'Good evenin', _Mister_ Larkin,' said the gentleman's gentleman, as he\r\nalso mounted to ride off. The emphasis on the 'Mister' was too much for\r\nthe trader, and taking one spring toward the darky, he laid his stout\r\nwhip across his face. The scented ebony roared, and just then his horse,\r\na high-blooded animal, reared and threw him. When he had gathered\r\nhimself up, Larkin made several warm applications of his thick boot to\r\nthe inexpressible part of the darky's person, and, roaring with pain,\r\nthat personage made off at a gait faster than that of his runaway horse.\r\n\r\nDuring the affray the occupants of the ground gathered around the\r\nbelligerents; but as soon as it was over, they went quietly back to\r\n'old-sledge' 'seven-up,' 'pitch-and-toss,' 'chuck-a-luck,' and the\r\n'turkey match.'\r\n\r\nAs we walked toward the shanty, the trader said: 'Thet feller's a fool.\r\nWhat a chance he's throwin' away! He arn't of no more use than a rotten\r\ncoon skin or a dead herrin', he arn't. All on our young bucks is jest\r\nlike him. The country's going to the devil, sure;' and with this choice\r\nbit of moralizing, he entered the cabin.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nThe Squire was pacing to and fro in the upper end of the room, and the\r\nwoman and children were seated on the low bench near the counter.\r\nPhyllis lifted her eyes to my face as I entered, with a hopeful,\r\ninquiring expression, but they fell again when the trader said: 'Thet's\r\nthe gal fur ye, Mr. Kirke; the most perfectest gal in seven States; good\r\nat onything, washin', ironin', nussin', breedin'; rig'larly fotched up;\r\nworth her weight in gold; d----d if she haint.' Turning then to Preston,\r\nhe exclaimed: 'Why, Squire, how ar ye?'\r\n\r\n'Very well,' replied my friend, coolly.\r\n\r\n'How's times?' continued the trader.\r\n\r\n'Very well,' said Preston, in a tone which showed a decided distaste for\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n'Well, glad on it. I heerd ye were hard put. Glad on it, Squire.'\r\n\r\nThe Squire took no further notice of him; and, turning to his property,\r\nthe trader said: 'Stand up, gal, and let me show the gentleman what yer\r\nmade of. Doan't look so down in the mouth, gal; this gentleman's got a\r\nfriend thet'll keep ye in the style ye's fotched up ter.'\r\n\r\nPhyllis rose and made a strong effort to appear composed.\r\n\r\n'Now, Mr. Kirke, luk at thet rig,' said Larkin, seizing her rudely by\r\nthe arm and turning her half around; 'straight's a rail. Luk at thet\r\nankle and fut--nimble's a squirrel, and healthy!--why, ye couldn't\r\nsicken har if ye put har ter hosspetal work.'\r\n\r\n'Well, never mind. I see what she is. What's your price?'\r\n\r\n'But ye haint seed har, yit! She's puny like, I knows, but she's solid,\r\n_I_ reckon; thar haint a pound of loose stuff on har--it's all muscle.\r\nSee thar--jest look o' thet,' and he stripped the sleeve of her dress\r\nto the elbow; 'thar's a arm fur ye--whiter'n buttermilk, and harder'n\r\ncheese. Feel on't.'\r\n\r\nThe poor woman submitted meekly to this rough handling of her person,\r\nbut I said impatiently:\r\n\r\n'I tell you, Larkin, I'm satisfied. Name your price. I've no time to\r\nlose: the stage will be along in five minutes.'\r\n\r\n'The stage! Lord bless ye, Mr. Kirke, it's broke down--'twon't be har\r\nfur an hour--I knows. Now look o' thet,' he continued, drawing the poor\r\nwoman's thin dress tightly across her limbs, while he proceeded, despite\r\nmy repeated attempts to interrupt him, with his disgusting exhibitions,\r\nwhich it would be disgraceful even to describe. 'Ye doan't mind, do ye,\r\ngal?' he added, chucking her under the chin in a rude, familiar way, and\r\ngiving a brutal laugh. Phyllis shrank away from him, but made no reply.\r\nShe had evidently braced her mind to the ordeal, and was prepared to\r\nbear anything rather than offend him. I determined to stop any further\r\nproceeding, and said to him:\r\n\r\n'I tell you, Larkin, I'm satisfied. I cannot waste more time in this\r\nmanner. Name your price at once.'\r\n\r\n'Time! Mr. Kirke? why yer time arn't worth nothin' jest now. The stage\r\nwon't be 'long till dark. Ye haint seed half on har, yit. I doan't want\r\nter sell ye a damaged article. I want ter show ye she's sound's a\r\nnut--_ye won't pay my price ef I doan't_. Look a thar, now,' and with a\r\nquick, dexterous movement, he tore open the front of her dress. * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe poor girl, unable to use her hands, bent over nearly double, and\r\nstrained the children to her breast to hide her shame. A movement at the\r\nother end of the room made me look at the Squire. With his jaws set, his\r\nhands clenched, and his face on fire, he bounded toward the trader. In a\r\nmoment he would have been upon him. My own blood boiled, but, knowing\r\nthat an outbreak would be fatal to our purpose, I planted myself firmly\r\nin his way, and said, as I took him by the arm and held him by main\r\nforce:\r\n\r\n'Stand back, Preston; this is my affair.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Squire,' added the trader, 'ye'd better be quiet. Ye'll turn\r\ntrader, yerself, yit. If things is true, ye'll have ter begin on yer own\r\nnigs, mighty sudden.'\r\n\r\n'If I am brought to that,' replied the Squire, with the calm dignity\r\nwhich was natural to him, 'I shall treat them like human beings--not\r\nlike brutes.'\r\n\r\n'Ye'll show 'em off the best how ye kin; let ye alone fur thet; I know\r\nyer hull parson tribe; thar haint nary a honest one among ye.'\r\n\r\nPreston turned silently away, as if disdaining to waste words on such a\r\nsubject; and I said to the trader:\r\n\r\n'Mr. Larkin, I've told you I've no time to lose. Name your price at\r\nonce, or I'll not buy the woman at all.'\r\n\r\n'Well, jest as ye say, Mr. Kirke. But ye see she's a rare 'un; would\r\nbring two thousand in Orleans, sure's a gun.'\r\n\r\n'Pshaw! you know better than that; but, name your price.'\r\n\r\n'What, fur the hull, or the 'ooman alone?'\r\n\r\n'Either way; I've no particular use for the children, but I'll buy them\r\nif cheap.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! _do_ buy us,' cried the little girl, taking hold of my coat; 'do\r\nbuy us--please do, good massa.'\r\n\r\n'Shet up, ye young whelp,' said the trader, raising his whip. The little\r\nthing slunk back affrighted, and commenced sobbing, but said no more.\r\n\r\n'Well, Mr. Kirke, the lot cost me sixteen fifty, hard rocks, and 'twas\r\ndirt cheap, 'cause the 'ooman alone'll bring more'n thet. I couldn't hev\r\nbought har fur thet, but har owner wus hard up. Ye see he's Gin'ral----,\r\ndown ter Newbern, one of yer rig'lar 'ristocrats, the raal ole-fashioned\r\nsort--keeps a big plantation, house in town; fine wines; fine wimmin;\r\nfast hosses; and goes it mighty strong. Well, he's allers a trifle\r\nunder--ev'ry year 'bout two thousand short; and ev'ry year I buy a\r\ncouple or so of nigs on him ter make it up. He's a pertickerler friend\r\no' mine, ye see; he thinks a heap o' me--he does. Well, when I gets\r\n'long thar t'other day, he says ter me, says he: 'Lark,' (he allers\r\ncalls me Lark; thet's the name I goes by 'mong my intimate 'quaintance),\r\nwell, says he; 'Lark, thar's Phylly. I want ye ter take har. She's the\r\nlikeliest gal in the world--good old Virginny blood, father one of the\r\nraal old stock. Ye knows she's right, good ev'ry way, prays like a camp\r\nmeetin', and virtuous ter kill; thar ain't none round har thet's up to\r\nhar at thet--tried ter cum round har myself, but couldn't git nigher'n a\r\nrod--won't hev but one man, and'll stick ter him like death; jest the\r\ngal fur one o' them New Orleans bloods as wants one thet'll be true ter\r\n'em. Do ye take, Lark?' says he. 'Well, I do, says I, and I knows just\r\nthe feller fur har; one of yer raal high-flyers--rich's a Jew--twenty\r\nthousand a year--lives like a prince--got one or two on 'em now; but he\r\nsays to me when I comes off, 'Lark,' says he, 'find me a gal, raather\r\npale, tidy, hard's a nut, and not bigger'n a cotton bale.' Wall, says I,\r\n'I will,' and, Gin'ral, Phylly's the gal! She'll hev good times, live\r\nlike a queen, hev wines, dresses, hosses, operas, and all them sort o'\r\nthings--ye knows them ar fellers doan't stand fur trifles.' 'Yes, I\r\nknows, Lark,' says the Gin'ral, 'and bein' it's so, ye kin take har,\r\nLark; but I wouldn't sell har ter ary nother man livin'--if I would,\r\nd----n me. Ye kin hev har, Lark, but ye must take the young 'uns; she's\r\ngot two, ye knows, and it hain't Christian-like ter sell 'em apart.'\r\n'D----n the young 'uns, Gin'ral,' says I,' I karn't do nary a thing with\r\nthem. What'll one o' them young bloods want o' them? They goes in fur\r\nhome manufactures.' 'Yes, I knows, Lark,' says he, 'but ye kin sell 'em\r\noff thar--ony planter'll buy 'em--they'll pay ter raise. They're two\r\nlikely little gals, ye knows; honest born, white father, and'll make\r\nhan'some wimmin--han'somer'n thar mother, and sell higher when they's\r\ngrow'd; ye'd better take 'em, Lark. If ye doan't, I'm d----d if I'll\r\nsell ye the mother; fur, ye see, I _must_ have the hull vally, now,\r\nthat's honest.' 'Wall, Gin'ral,' says I, 'ye allers talks right out,\r\nthat's what I likes in ye. What's the price?' 'Wall,' says he, 'bein'\r\nit's ye, and ye've a good master in yer eye for Phylly, I'll say two\r\nthousand fur the lot--the gal alone'll fetch twenty-five hun'red down\r\nter Orleans.' 'Whew!' says I, 'Gin'ral, ye've been a takin' suthin'.\r\n(But he hadn't; he war soberer than a church clock; 'twarn't more'n\r\n'lev'n, and he's never drunk 'fore evenin'.) Wall,' says I, 'karn't\r\nthink of it, nohow, Gin'ral.' Then he come down ter eighteen, but I\r\ncounted out sixteen fifty--good rags of the old State Bank--and I'm\r\nblamed if he didn't take it. I'd no idee he wud; but debt, Mr. Kirke,\r\ndebt's the devil--but it helps us, 'cause, I s'pose (and he laughed his\r\nhardened, brutal laugh), we do the devil's own work. But be thet how it\r\nmay, if these high flyin' planters didn't run inter it, and hev ter pay\r\nup, nigger spec'latin' wouldn't be worth follerin'. Well, I took the\r\nnig's, and thar they is; and bein' it's you, Mr. Kirke, and yer a friend\r\nof the ole man, you shill hev the lot fur a hun'red and fifty more, or\r\nthe 'ooman alone fur fifteen hun'red; but ary nother white man couldn't\r\ntoch 'em fur less'n two thousand--if they could, d----n me.'\r\n\r\nThe stage had not arrived, and I had submitted to this lengthy harangue,\r\nbecause I saw I could more certainly accomplish the purchase by\r\nindulging the humor of the trader. The suspense was, no doubt, agony to\r\nPhyllis, and the Squire manifested decided impatience, but the delay\r\nseemed unavoidable. It was difficult for Preston to control himself. He\r\nchafed like a chained tiger. At first he paced up and down the farther\r\nside of the apartment, then sat down, then rose and paced the room\r\nagain, and then again sat down, every now and then glaring upon Larkin\r\nwith a look of savage ferocity that showed the wild beast was rising in\r\nhim. The trader once in a while looked toward him with a cool unconcern\r\nthat indicated two things: nerves of iron, and perfect familiarity with\r\nsuch demonstrations.\r\n\r\nFearing an explosion, I at last stepped up to the Squire, and said to\r\nhim in a low tone: 'Let me beg of you to leave the room--_do_--you may\r\nspoil all.' He made no reply, but did as I requested.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, Larkin remarked, in an indifferent way, 'The Squire's\r\ngot the devil in him. He's some when his blood's up--edged tools,\r\ndangerous ter handle--he is--I knows him.' I'd ruther have six like Tom\r\non me, ony time, than one like him. But he karn't skeer me. The man\r\ndoan't breathe thet kin turn Jake Larkin a hair.'\r\n\r\n'I see he's excited,' I replied; 'but why is he so interested in this\r\nwoman?'\r\n\r\n'Why? She was fotched up 'long with him--children together. He owned har\r\ntill he got in the nine-holes one day, and sold har ter the Gin'ral. I'd\r\nbet a pile the young 'uns ar his'n. He knows har as he do the psa'm\r\nbook. Ha! ha!' and he laughed his brutal laugh, as, chucking Phyllis\r\nagain under the chin, he asked, 'Doan't he, gal?'\r\n\r\nShe shrank away from him, but said nothing.\r\n\r\n'Doan't be squeamy, gal; out with it; we'll think the more on ye fur't.\r\nArn't the young 'uns his'n? Didn't ye b'long ter the Squire till he got\r\nso d----d pious five year ago?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, master; I belonged to him; Master Robert wus allers pious.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I knows; he wus allers preachin' pious. But didn't ye b'long ter\r\nhim--ye knows what I means--till he got so d----d camp-meetin' pious\r\nfive year ago?'\r\n\r\n'Master Robert was allers camp-meetin' pious,' replied the woman,\r\nlooking down, and drawing her thin shawl more closely over her open\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n'Well,' said Larkin, 'ye karn't git nothin' out o' har, but it's\r\nso--sartin! Ev'ry 'un says so; and what ev'ry 'un says arn't more'n a\r\nmile from the truth. Jest look o' that little 'un. Doan't ye see the\r\nSquire's eyes and forrerd thar?' and he took the little girl roughly by\r\nthe arm, and turned her face toward mine. The lower part of her features\r\nwere like her mother's, but her eyes, hair, and forehead were Preston's!\r\n\r\n'Yes, I see,' I said; 'but you spoke of two little girls; where is the\r\nother?'\r\n\r\n'Well, you see, I bought 'em both, and the Gin'ral give me a bill o'\r\nsale on 'em; but when we come to look arter the young 'un in the\r\nmornin', she warn't thar. The Gin'ral's 'ooman--she's a 'ooman fur me--a\r\nhull team--she makes him stan' round, _I_ reckon. Well, she'd a likin'\r\nfor the little 'un, and she swoore she shouldn't be sold. She told me\r\nter my face she'd packed har off whar I couldn't git har, nohow; and she\r\nsaid she'd raise the town, and hev me driv' out if I 'tempted it.'\r\n\r\n'What did you do then?' I asked.\r\n\r\n'Well, ye knows the Gin'ral's a honerubble man; so, when he seed his\r\n'ooman was sot thet way, he throw'd in the yaller boy--and he's wuth a\r\nhun'red more'n the gal, ony day. His mother took on ter kill, 'cause the\r\nGin'ral'd sort o' promised him ter har, and she'd been a savin' up ter\r\nbuy him. But the Gin'ral's a honerubble man, and he didn't flinch a\r\nhair--not a hair. Thet's the sort ter deal with, I say. I stuck fur the\r\nlittle gal, though--'cause, ye see, I'd takin' a likin' ter har\r\nmyself--she's the pootiest little thing ye ever seed, she is; but the\r\nGin'ral he said 'twarn't no use, fur his 'ooman would have har way, and\r\nfinally I guv in, and took another bill o' sale. And what d'ye think!\r\nI'd no more'n got it inter my pocket, 'fore the Gin'ral's 'ooman pulled\r\nout a gold watch, two or three diamond pins, a ring or two, and some\r\nwimmin's fixin's, and says she, 'See thar, _Mister_ Larkin, them's what\r\nI got fur the little gal. _I've_ sold har--sold har this mornin', and\r\nguv the bill o' sale; and if the Gin'ral doan't cartify it, he woan't\r\ngit no peace, I reckon. I was bound ter see one on 'em done right by, I\r\nwas.' Well, I told har she wus ahead o' my time, and I put out raather\r\nsudden, I did. A 'ooman's the devil; I'd ruther trade with twenty men\r\nthan one 'ooman, I swar.'\r\n\r\nWhen he spoke of her child, the slave woman burst into tears. Her\r\nemotion drowned the curiosity which had made me a patient listener to\r\nthe trader's story, and recalled me to the business in hand. With some\r\ntwinges of conscience for having kept the wretched girl so long on the\r\nrack, I said to him, 'Well, Larkin, let's get through with this. Name\r\nyour lowest price for the lot.'\r\n\r\n'P'raps you'd as lief throw out the boy. I'll take off three hundred fur\r\nhim.'\r\n\r\n'Oh! doan't ye leab Ally, massa; buy Ally too, massa; oh do, good\r\nmassa!' he cried, with an expression of keen agony such as I had never\r\ntill then seen in a child. He was a 'likely' little fellow, with a\r\nround, good-natured face, and a bright, intelligent eye; and though I\r\npresumed Preston felt no particular interest in him, I thought of his\r\nmother, depriving herself of sleep and rest to save up the price of her\r\nboy, and I said: 'No, I have taken a liking to him; I'll take the whole\r\nor none.'\r\n\r\n'Well, then, seventeen fifty, not a dime less. Thet's only a hun'red\r\nprofit.'\r\n\r\n'Will a hundred profit satisfy you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, bein' as you's a friend of the ole man, and I hain't had 'em only\r\nfour days.'\r\n\r\nI quietly sat down on the bench, beside the little girl, and taking her\r\nhand in mine, and playing with her small fingers in a careless way,\r\nsaid: 'Well, I will give you a hundred profit; but, Larkin,' and I\r\nlooked him directly in the eye and smiled, 'you cannot intend to come\r\nthe Yankee over me! I am one of them myself, you know, and understand\r\nsuch things. These people cost you twelve hundred--not a mill more.'\r\n\r\n'The h----ll they did! P'raps ye mean ter say I lie?' he replied, in an\r\nexcited tone, his face reddening with anger.\r\n\r\n'No, I don't. I merely state a fact, and you know it. So keep cool.'\r\n\r\n'It's a d----d lie, sir. I doan't keer who says it,' he exclaimed, now\r\nreally excited.\r\n\r\n'Come, come, my fine fellow,' I said, rising and facing him; 'skip the\r\nhard words, and don't get up too much steam--it might hurt you, _or your\r\nfriends_.'\r\n\r\n'What d'ye mean? Speak out, Mr. Kirke. If ye doan't want ter buy 'em,\r\nsay so, and hev done with it.' This was said in a more moderate tone. He\r\nhad evidently taken my meaning, and feared he had gone too far.\r\n\r\n'I mean simply this. This woman and the children cost you twelve hundred\r\ndollars four days ago. Preston wants them--_must_ have them--and he will\r\ngive thirteen hundred for them, and pay you in a year, with interest;\r\nthat's all.'\r\n\r\n'Well, come now, Mr. Kirke, thet's liberal, arn't it! S'pose I doan't\r\ntake it, what then?'\r\n\r\n'Then Roye, Struthers & Co. will stop your supplies, _or I'll stop\r\ntheir's_--that's 'SARTIN',' and I laughed good-humoredly as I said it.\r\n\r\n'Well, yer one on 'em, Mr. Kirke, thet's a fact;' and then he added,\r\nseriously, 'but ye karn't mean to saddle my doin's onter them.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, I will; and tell them they have you to thank for it.'\r\n\r\n'What,' and he struck his forehead with his hand; 'what a dangnation\r\nfool I wus ter tell ye 'bout them!'\r\n\r\n'Of course, you were; and a greater one to say you paid sixteen fifty\r\nfor the property. I'd have given fifteen hundred for them if you had\r\ntold the truth. But come, what do you say; are they Preston's or not?'\r\n\r\n'No, I karn't do it; karn't take Preston's note--'tain't wuth a hill o'\r\nbeans. Give me the money, and it's a trade.'\r\n\r\n'Preston is cramped, and cannot pay the money just now. I'll give you\r\nmy note, if you prefer it.'\r\n\r\n'Payable in York, interest and exchange?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it's done. And now, d----n the nigs. I'll never buy ary 'nother\r\ngood-lookin' 'un as long's I live.'\r\n\r\n'I hope you won't,' I replied, laughing.\r\n\r\nHe then produced a blank note and a bill of sale, and drawing from his\r\npocket a pen and a small ink bottle, said to me: 'Thar, Mr. Kirke, ye\r\nfill up the note, and I'll make out the bill o' sale. I'm handy at such\r\ndoin's.'\r\n\r\n'Give me the key of these bracelets first. Make out the bill to\r\nPreston--Robert Preston, of Jones County.'\r\n\r\nHe handed me the key, and I unlocked the shackles. 'Now, Phyllis,' I\r\nsaid, 'it is over. Go and tell Master Robert.'\r\n\r\nShe rose, threw her arms wildly above her head, and staggering weakly\r\nforward, without saying a word, left the cabin. Yelping and leaping with\r\njoy, the yellow boy followed her; but the little girl came to me, and\r\nlooking up timidly in my face, said: 'O massa! Rosey so glad 'ou got\r\nmammy--Rosey _so_ glad. Rosey lub 'ou, massa--Rosey lub 'ou a heap.' I\r\nthought of the little girl I had left at home, and with a sudden impulse\r\nlifted the child from the floor and kissed her. She put her little arms\r\nabout my neck, laid her soft cheek against mine, and burst into tears.\r\nShe was not accustomed to much kindness.\r\n\r\nI filled out the note and gave it to the trader; and, with the bill of\r\nsale in my hand, was about to go in search of Preston, when he and\r\nPhyllis entered the cabin. I handed him the document, and glancing it\r\nover, he placed it in his pocket book.\r\n\r\n'Now, Larkin,' I said, 'this is a wretched business; give it up; there's\r\ntoo much of the man in you for this sort of thing.'\r\n\r\n'Well, p'raps yer right, Mr. Kirke; but I'm in it, and I karn't git out;\r\nbut it seems ter me it tain't no wuss dealin' in 'em then ownin' 'em.'\r\n\r\n'I don't know. Is it not a little worse on the man himself? Does it not\r\nsort of harden you--blunt your better feelings, to be always buying and\r\nselling people that do not want to be bought and sold?'\r\n\r\n'Well, p'raps it do; it's a cussed business ony how. But thar's my hand,\r\nMr. Kirke. Yer a gentleman, I swar, if ye _hev_ come it over me, ha! ha!\r\nHow slick you done it! I likes ye the better fur it; and if Jake Larkin\r\nkin ever do ye a good turn, he'll do it. I allers takes ter a man thet's\r\nsmarter nor I am, I do,' and he gave my hand another of his powerful\r\nshakes.\r\n\r\n'I thank you, Larkin; and if I can ever serve you, it will give me great\r\npleasure to do so.'\r\n\r\n'I doan't doubt it, Mr. Kirke, I doan't; and I'll call on ye, sure, if\r\nye ever kin do me ony good. Good-by; ye want ter be with the Squire;\r\ngood-by;' and giving my hand another shake, he left the cabin.\r\n\r\nWhich was the worse--that coarse, hardened man, or the institution which\r\nhad made him what he was?\r\n\r\nIt was many years before the trader and I met again. When we did, he\r\nkept his word!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNION.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving stated the course of England on the slavery question and the\r\nrebellion, gladly would I rest here; but, as a Northern man, by\r\nparentage, birth, and education, always devoted to the Union, twice\r\nelected by Mississippi to the Senate of the United States, as the ardent\r\nopponent of nullification and secession, and, _upon that very question_,\r\nhaving announced in my first address, of January, 1833, the right and\r\nduty of the Government, by \"_coercion_,\" if necessary, to suppress\r\nrebellion or secession by any State, truth and justice compel me to say,\r\nthat we of the North, next to England, are responsible for the\r\nintroduction of slavery into the South. Upon a much smaller scale than\r\nEngland, but, under her flag, which was then ours, and the force of\r\ncolonial tradition, we followed the wretched example of England, and\r\nNorthern vessels, sailing from Northern ports, and owned by Northern\r\nmerchants, brought back to our shores from Africa their living cargoes.\r\n\r\nSmall numbers only of these slaves were brought from their tropical\r\nAfrican homes to the colder North, where their labor was unprofitable,\r\nbut, were taken to the South, and against their earnest protest, forced\r\nupon them. It was not the South that engaged in the African slave trade.\r\nIt was not the South that brought slavery into America. No, it was\r\nforced upon the South, against their protest, mainly by England, but\r\npartly, also, by the North. Believing, as I do, that this war was\r\nproduced by slavery, we should still remember by whom the slaves were\r\nimported here.\r\n\r\nNor should we forget how zealously, from first to last, Virginia,\r\nMaryland, and Delaware, in framing the Federal Constitution, sustained\r\nby Washington, Franklin, and Hamilton, and by New York, Pennsylvania,\r\nand New Jersey, opposed the continuance, even for a day, of the African\r\nslave trade, and how they were overborne by the unfortunate coalition of\r\nthe Eastern States with Georgia and the Carolinas, legalizing the\r\nexecrable traffic for twenty years, and how fearfully the predictions of\r\nthose great prophet statesmen, George Mason, of Virginia, and Luther\r\nMartin, of Maryland, have been fulfilled, that this fatal measure, by\r\nthe force of its moral influence in favor of slavery, and by the rapid\r\nimportation of negroes here, would menace the peace and safety of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when the Constitution was framed, Virginia, Maryland, and\r\nDelaware, not only opposed the African slave trade, but interdicted the\r\ninterstate slave trade. All these States then regarded slavery as a\r\ngreat evil, destined soon to disappear, and the failure to adopt gradual\r\nemancipation arose, mainly, from the fact, that the majority could not\r\nagree as to the practical details of the measure. In Virginia,\r\nWashington, Jefferson, George Mason, Madison and Monroe, Marshall and\r\nSt. George Tucker, were all gradual emancipationists. Even as late as\r\n1830, the measure failed, only by a single vote in the Virginia State\r\nConvention; and this year, Western Virginia has voted for manumission\r\nwith great unanimity. Let us then, as a nation, do our full duty on this\r\nquestion to all loyal citizens; and the border States, acting by compact\r\nwith the Federal Government, will surely adopt the system of gradual\r\nemancipation and colonization. The failure of any State to adopt the\r\nmeasure immediately, although greatly to be deplored, is no indication\r\nas to what their course will be when the rebellion shall have been\r\nsuppressed, and Congress acted definitely on the subject.\r\n\r\nAs the North, next to England, was mainly responsible for forcing\r\nslavery upon the South, honor demands that the whole nation, as an act\r\nof justice, and as a measure that would greatly exalt the character of\r\nthe country, should bear any loss that may arise to loyal citizens from\r\na change of system in any State. Indeed, under all the circumstances,\r\nthe nation cannot afford to leave all the sacrifice, and all the glory\r\nof such an achievement, to the South only. It will be a grand historical\r\nfact in the progress of humanity, and must adorn the annals of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nI speak now of the slaves of the loyal. What course should be pursued\r\nwith the slaves of rebels, is a very different question. As regards the\r\nseceded States, it is clear, as our army advances, that the slaves of\r\nthe disloyal, _seized_ or coming _voluntarily_ within our lines, with or\r\nwithout previous proclamation, necessarily will be, and ought to be\r\nemancipated, under that clause of the Constitution authorizing Congress\r\nto 'make rules concerning captures on _land_ and water,' and the law\r\ncarrying that provision into effect. There never has been a war, foreign\r\nor intestine, in which slaves coming within the lines of an army have\r\nnot been emancipated. In the case of Rose vs. Himly, 2d Curtis, 87, the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States declared that, in case of rebellion,\r\n'_belligerent_ rights may be superadded to those of _sovereignty_,' and\r\nthat we may punish the rebels as _traitors_, or, treating them, by land\r\nand sea, as we now do, as _belligerents_, under the war power, which is\r\nalso a constitutional power, we may enforce the same military\r\ncontributions, or make the same captures, as in case of a foreign war.\r\nIndeed, if this were otherwise, our Constitution, as claimed by\r\nsecessionists and anti-coercionists, at home and abroad, would have been\r\na miserable failure, and would have invited rebellion, by depriving us\r\nof the power to suppress it by all war measures recognized by the law of\r\nnations. Such is the law, ancient and modern, and the uniform practice\r\nof nations in suppressing rebellion. Such acts are not bills of\r\nattainder, operating as judgments without war or capture, but the\r\nexercise by Congress of the power expressly granted by the Constitution,\r\napplicable, as the Supreme Court has declared, in case of rebellion, to\r\n'make rules concerning captures on land and water.' But this provision\r\nimplies capture or conquest, and the act of Congress proposes no mere\r\npaper edicts, which, without capture or conquest, can only operate as\r\noffers of conditional amnesty to rebels, or freedom to slaves. This\r\ngreat constitutional war power, as our army advances, should be clearly\r\n_proclaimed_ and _exercised_, and the slaves of the disloyal, used, as\r\nthey are, to supply the means of support to the rebel armies, should be\r\nemancipated, as required by Congress, and employed, at reasonable wages,\r\nin some useful labor in aid of the Union cause. In this way, the rebel\r\nwhites and masters must soon, to a vast extent, leave the army, to raise\r\nthe provisions now supplied by their slaves, and the war thus much more\r\nspeedily be brought to a successful conclusion. By paper edicts I mean\r\nthose designed to operate as judgments or sentences, without capture or\r\nconquest, and not those announced under the acts of Congress, in\r\nadvance, but only to become operative and consummated in the contingency\r\nof capture or conquest. The unconditional friends of the Union should\r\nnot only adhere to the Constitution as the bulwark of our cause, but\r\nwill find in that great instrument the most ample power to suppress the\r\nrebellion. It is the rebels who are striving to overthrow the\r\nConstitution, and we who are resolved to maintain and enforce it, in war\r\nand in peace, as 'the _supreme_ law of the land,' in _every State_, from\r\nthe lakes to the gulf, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nIt is vain to deny the prejudice in the North against the negro race,\r\nconstantly increasing as the numbers multiply, accompanied by the stern\r\nrefusal of social or political equality with the negro, and the serious\r\napprehension among their working classes of the degradation of labor by\r\nnegro association, and the reduction of wages to a few cents a day by\r\nnegro competition--all demonstrating, as a question of interest, as well\r\nas of humanity, that it is best for them, as for us, that the\r\nseparation, though necessarily gradual and voluntary, must be complete\r\nand eternal.\r\n\r\nWherever the vote of the people of any State of the North has been taken\r\non this question, it has been uniformly for the exclusion of the free\r\nnegro race. In the midst of the excitement of the slavery question in\r\nKansas, when the republicans acted alone upon the question of the\r\nadoption of their celebrated Topeka constitution, they submitted the\r\nfree negro question to a distinct vote of the people, which was almost\r\nunanimous for their exclusion. The recent similar overwhelming vote, to\r\nthe same effect, of the people of Illinois, is another clear test of the\r\npresent sentiment of the nation. That sentiment is this: that the negro,\r\nalthough to be regarded as a man, and treated with humanity, belongs, as\r\nthey believe, to an inferior race, communion or association with whom is\r\nnot desired by the whites. Those who regard the slavery question as the\r\nonly, or the principal difficulty, are greatly mistaken. The _negro_\r\nquestion is far deeper. It is not slavery, as a mere political\r\ninstitution, that is sustained in the South, but the greater question of\r\nthe intermingling and equality of races. In this aspect, it is far more\r\na question of race than of slavery. If, as among the Greeks and Romans,\r\nthe white race were enslaved here, the institution would instantly\r\ndisappear. Among the many millions of the population of the South, less\r\nthan a tenth are slaveholders. Why, then, is it, that the\r\nnon-slaveholding masses there support the institution? It is the\r\ninstinct, the sentiment, the prejudice, if you please, of race, almost\r\nuniversal and unalterable. It is the fear that if the slaves of the\r\nSouth were emancipated, the non-slaveholding whites would be sunk down\r\nto their level. But let the non-slaveholders of the South know that\r\ncolonization abroad would certainly accompany gradual emancipation, and\r\nthey would support the measure. They do not wish the Africans among\r\nthem; but if that must be the case, then they desire them to remain as\r\nslaves, and not to be raised to their own condition as freemen, to\r\ndegrade labor and reduce its wages, as they believe. Abolition alone,\r\ntouches then merely the surface of this question. It lies far deeper, in\r\nthe antagonism of race, and the laws of nature. In this respect there is\r\na union of sentiment between the masses, North and South, both opposing\r\nthe introduction of free blacks.\r\n\r\nShould the slaves be gradually manumitted and colonized abroad with\r\ntheir consent, and the North be thereafter reproached with aiding to\r\nforce slavery upon the South, we could then truly say, that we had\r\nfinally freely united with the South in expending our treasure to remove\r\nthe evil. The offence of our forefathers would then be gloriously\r\nredeemed by the justice and generosity of their children, and made\r\ninstrumental in carrying commerce, civilization, and Christianity to the\r\nbenighted regions of Africa. Nor should the colonization be confined to\r\nAfrica, but extended to 'Mexico, Central and Southern America' (as\r\nproposed in my Texas letter of the 8th January, 1844), and to the West\r\nIndies, or such other homes as might be preferred by the negro race.\r\n\r\nFrom my youth upward, at all times and under all circumstances, whether\r\nresiding North or South, whether in public or in private life, I have\r\never supported gradual emancipation, accompanied by colonization, as the\r\nonly remedy for the evil of slavery. In my Texas letter, just referred\r\nto, published at its date over my signature, being then a senator from\r\nMississippi, I expressed the following opinions on this great question:\r\n\r\n'Again the question is asked, is slavery never to disappear from the\r\nUnion? This is a startling and momentous question, but the answer is\r\neasy and the proof is clear--_it will certainly disappear if Texas is\r\nreannexed to the Union_, not by abolition, but in spite of all its\r\nfrenzy, slowly and gradually, by diffusion, as it has thus nearly\r\nreceded from several of the more Northern of the slaveholding States,\r\nand as it will certainly continue more rapidly to recede by the\r\nreannexation of Texas, into _Mexico and Central and Southern America_.\r\nProvidence * * * thus will open Texas as a safety-valve, into and\r\nthrough which slavery will slowly and gradually recede, and finally\r\ndisappear into the boundless regions of Mexico, and Central and Southern\r\nAmerica. Beyond the Del Norte _slavery will not pass_; not only because\r\nit is forbidden by law, but because the colored races there preponderate\r\nin the ratio of ten to one over the whites, and holding, as they do, the\r\ngovernment and most of the offices in their own possession, they will\r\nnever permit the enslavement of any portion of the colored race, which\r\nmakes and executes the laws of the country. In Bradford's Atlas the\r\nfacts are given as follows:\r\n\r\n'Mexico, area 1,690,000 square miles; population eight millions, one\r\nsixth white, and all the rest Indians, Africans, Mulattoes, Zambos, and\r\nother colored races. Central America, area 186,000 square miles;\r\npopulation nearly two millions, one sixth white, and the rest Negroes,\r\nZambos, and other colored races. South America, area 6,500,000 square\r\nmiles; population fourteen millions, one million white, four millions\r\nIndians, and the remainder, being nine millions, blacks and other\r\ncolored races. The outlet for our negro race through this vast region\r\ncan never be opened but by the reannexation of Texas; but, in that\r\nevent, there, in that extensive country, bordering on our negro\r\npopulation, and four times greater in area than the whole Union, with a\r\nsparse population of but three to the square mile, where nine tenths of\r\nthe people are of the colored races--there, upon that fertile soil, and\r\nin that delicious climate, so admirably adapted to the negro race, as\r\nall experience has now clearly shown, the free black would find a home.\r\nThere, also, as the _slaves_, in the lapse of time, from the density of\r\npopulation and other causes, are _emancipated_, they will disappear,\r\nfrom time to time, west of the Del Norte, and beyond the limits of the\r\nUnion, and among a race of their own color will be diffused through this\r\nvast region, where they will not be a _degraded caste_, and where, as to\r\nclimate and social and moral condition, and all the hopes and comforts\r\nof life, they can occupy, _amid equals_, a position they can never\r\nattain in any part of this Union.'\r\n\r\nThis, it is true, was a slow process, but it was peaceful, progressive,\r\nand certain, especially when Texas should have been checkered by\r\nrailroads, and her system connected with that of the South and of\r\nMexico. I desired then, however, to accelerate this action, by making it\r\na part of the _compact_ of Texas with the Federal Government, that the\r\nproceeds of the sales of her public lands, exceeding two hundred\r\nmillions of acres, should be devoted in aid of the colonization\r\ndescribed in this extract. The principle, however, was adopted of State\r\naction by irrevocable _compact_ with the Federal Government, by which,\r\nprovision therein was made for abolishing slavery in all such States\r\nnorth of a certain parallel of latitude (embracing a territory larger\r\nthan New England), as might be thereafter admitted by subdivision of the\r\nState of Texas. The power of action on this subject, by _compact_ of a\r\nState with the General Government, was then clearly established, in\r\nperfect accordance with repeated previous acts of Congress, then cited\r\nby me. The doctrine rests upon the elemental principle of the combined\r\nauthority of the nation, and a State, acting by compact within its\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\nIt being clearly our interest and duty to adopt this system of gradual\r\nemancipation in the loyal States, with colonization abroad, aided by\r\nCongress, the constitutional power being unquestionable, and the\r\nexpense comparatively small (less than a few months' cost of the war,)\r\nit is a signal mark of that special Providence, which has so often\r\nshielded our beloved country from imminent peril, that the President of\r\nthe United States should have recommended, and Congress should have\r\nadopted, by so large a majority, this _very system_, by which slavery\r\nmight soon disappear, at least from the border States. In making an\r\nappropriation for gradual emancipation and colonization, so much of the\r\noverture as embraced colonization might and should be extended to the\r\nNorth, as well as the South, so as, with their consent, to colonize\r\nbeyond our limits the free blacks of _every State_.\r\n\r\nIn a former letter, published over my signature, of the 30th September,\r\n1856, called 'AN APPEAL FOR THE UNION,' I said: '_I have never\r\nbelieved in a peaceable dissolution of the Union_. * * _No; it will be\r\nwar_, CIVIL WAR, _of all others the most sanguinary and\r\nferocious._ * * _It will be marked_ * * _by frowning fortresses, by\r\nopposing batteries, by gleaming sabres, by bristling bayonets, by the\r\ntramp of contending armies, by towns and cities sacked and pillaged, by\r\ndwellings given to the flames, and fields laid waste and desolate. It\r\nwill be a second fall of mankind; and while we shall be performing here\r\nthe bloody drama of a nations suicide, from_ THE THRONES OF\r\nEUROPE _will arise the exulting shouts of despots, and upon their\r\ngloomy banners shall be inscribed, as, they believe, never to be\r\neffaced, their motto_, MAN IS INCAPABLE OF SELF-GOVERNMENT.'\r\nAlluding to the subject of the present discussion, I then also said: '_I\r\nsee, too, what, in this probable crisis of my country's destiny, it is\r\nmy duty again to repeat from my Texas letter_: * * THE AFRICAN\r\nRACE, _gradually disappearing from our borders, passing, in part,\r\nout of our limits to Mexico, and Central and Southern America, and in\r\npart returning to the shores of their ancestors, there, it is hoped, to\r\ncarry Christianity, civilization, and freedom throughout the benighted\r\nregions of the sons of Ham_.' My views, then, of 1844, were thus\r\ndistinctly reiterated in 1856, in favor of the gradual extinction of\r\nslavery, accompanied by colonization.\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States, in view of the limited appropriation\r\nby Congress, and the economy of short voyages, has recommended one of\r\nthe great interoceanic routes through the American isthmus for a new\r\nnegro colony. It is a great object to secure the control of this isthmus\r\nby a friendly race, born on our soil, and the selection corresponds with\r\nthe views expressed in my Texas letter of 1844. As, however, the negroes\r\ncan only be colonized by their own consent, we should therefore, and as\r\nan act of humanity and justice, open all suitable homes abroad for their\r\nfree choice. After much reflection, I think it is their interest and\r\nours (when the nation shall make large and adequate appropriations),\r\nmainly to seek Liberia as a permanent home, establishing there, among\r\ntheir own race, and in the land of their ancestors, a great republic.\r\nLiberia has already largely contributed to the decline of the African\r\nslave trade. She has reclaimed from barbarism, for civilization,\r\nChristianity, liberty, and the English language, 700 miles of the coast,\r\nrunning far into the interior, reaching a high, healthy, well watered,\r\nrich, and beautiful country. She has already civilized and Christianized\r\n300,000 native Africans, and brought them into willing obedience to her\r\ngovernment. As her power extends along the coast and into the interior,\r\nshe may soon extinguish the slave trade. This would relieve our\r\nsquadron, stationed by treaty on the African coast to suppress that\r\ntraffic, and leave the large sums, annually expended by Congress for\r\nthat purpose, to be applied in further aid of the cause of colonization.\r\n\r\nProvidence, for several centuries, has mysteriously connected our\r\ndestiny with that of the African race. This rebellion developes that\r\npurpose; the civilization of that race here, and their transfer to the\r\nland of their fathers, carrying with them our language, laws, religion,\r\nand free institutions, redeemed from the curse of slavery. Now, indeed,\r\nwe see the approaching fulfilment of prophecy, when 'Ethiopia shall\r\nstretch forth her hands unto God.' We have just established commercial\r\nand diplomatic relations with Liberia, and, in separating from the race\r\nhere, let us do them ample justice. Let us purchase for Liberia (which\r\ncan be done for a small sum), the great adjacent coast and interior of\r\nAfrica, and thus eventually evangelize and civilize that whole region.\r\nLiberia would thus expand and become the great Afric-American republic,\r\nand the dominant nation of that immense continent. Commerce, the first\r\ngreat missionary--like St. John in the wilderness, preceding the advent\r\nof the Redeemer--would penetrate that dark region, and the execrable\r\ntrade in human beings, give way to the interchange of products and\r\nmanufactures.\r\n\r\nThe _Westminster Review_ has said, 'The Americans are planting free\r\nnegroes on the coast of Africa; a greater event, probably, in its\r\nconsequences, than any that has occurred since Columbus set sail for the\r\nNew World.' Let us now adopt gradual emancipation, and the colonization\r\nof Africa, and the voyage of the great discoverer will have given\r\ncivilization and Christianity to two continents, and eventually, we\r\ntrust, the blessings of liberty to all mankind.\r\n\r\nThe divers products and fabrics of Africa and of our Union invite\r\nreciprocal commerce. We want her gold, coffee, ivory, dyestuffs, and\r\nnumerous raw materials of manufactures; and she wishes our fabrics,\r\nengines, agricultural implements, breadstuffs, and provisions. The trade\r\nwill give immense and profitable employment to our shipping. From the\r\nCape of Good Hope to the Mediterranean, from the Atlantic to the Red sea\r\nand the Indian ocean, Africa is tropical or semi-tropical. She has most\r\nof the products of the East and West Indies. She can produce cheaper and\r\nbetter cotton than any other region, except our Southern States, to\r\nwhich, from their fertile soil, and climate favored by the Gulf Stream,\r\nfree white labor will eventually give us, substantially, a monopoly of\r\nthat great staple. She equals any country in the production of sugar,\r\ncoffee, and cocoa. In palm oil and ivory she has almost a monopoly. Of\r\nspices, she has the clove, nutmeg, pepper, and cinnamon. Of dyes and\r\ndyewoods, she has indigo, camwood, harwood, and the materials for the\r\nbest blue, brown, red, and yellow colors. In nuts, she has the palm, the\r\nground, the cocoa, and the castor. In gums, she has the copal, senegal,\r\nmastic, India rubber, and gutta percha. In fruits, she has the orange,\r\nlime, lemon, citron, tamarind, papaw, banana, fig, grape, date,\r\npineapple, guava, and plantain. In vegetables, she has the yam, cassado,\r\ntan yan, and sweet potato. She has beeswax and honey, and most valuable\r\nskins and furs. In woods, she has the ebony, mangrove, silver tree,\r\nteak, unevah, lignumvitæ, rosewood, and mahogany. She has birds with the\r\nsweetest notes and brightest plumage, and fish and animals in the\r\ngreatest variety. There are the giant elephant, rhinoceros, and\r\nhippopotamus. There the lordly lion roams, the monarch of his native\r\nforest, as if conscious of furnishing robes for royalty and symbolizing\r\nthe flag of a great nation. Where animals of such sagacity, courage,\r\npower, and majesty are found, why should not man be great also? Our\r\nancestors, the Britons, were once savages; so were our Celtic and Saxon\r\nforefathers, and most of them were slaves. What are their descendants\r\nnow? Let Shakespeare, Newton, Fox, Burke, Pitt, Peel, Washington,\r\nWellington, Franklin and Hamilton, Madison and Jefferson, the Adamses,\r\nWebster, Clay, and Jackson answer the question. I am hopeful of complete\r\nsuccess; but whatever the result may be, we owe to ourselves, to our\r\nmoral and material progress, but, above all, to the down-trodden race so\r\nlong enslaved among us, to make the great experiment. If we succeed, it\r\nwill be a monument to our glory, that will endure when time shall have\r\ncrumbled the pyramids. If we fail, it will have been a noble effort in\r\nthe cause of justice and humanity. Here, with the sentiment almost\r\nuniversal against the negro race, indicated by the votes and acts of all\r\nsections, and their exclusion everywhere, North and South, practically,\r\nfrom all social or political equality with the whites, they can never\r\nhave among us any of those hopes, aspirations, energy, or opportunities,\r\nenabling them to test their capacity for great improvement. It is only\r\nwhere they shall be equals among equals, that they can ever attain high\r\nelevation. I take the facts as they are, and know that this prejudice of\r\nrace here is ineradicable. In making the vain and hopeless effort to\r\nchange it, we sacrifice to an impracticable idea our own good, and that\r\nof the race whose welfare we seek to promote. Colonization has\r\nheretofore been opposed by many, because they believed it hostile to\r\nmanumission; but now, when emancipation is proposed, with appropriations\r\nto enable the manumitted to choose freely between remaining here and\r\nhomes elsewhere, why should such a system encounter any hostility?\r\nEspecially, when millions will vote for emancipation, if connected with\r\nvoluntary colonization, why continue to oppose it? What objection is\r\nthere to furnishing the means to enable the free or freed blacks to\r\nremain or to emigrate, and why should any of their friends wish to\r\ndeprive them of such a privilege? Opposition springs also from\r\nconfounding the border with the seceded States--the slaves of the loyal\r\nwith those of the disloyal, and the conduct of the war; but the\r\nquestions are different and independent.\r\n\r\nOn this subject of what is called abroad the prejudice of color, the\r\nNorth has been censured, even by many of our best friends. But it is\r\nimpossible for Europe, where the African race are not, and never have\r\nbeen, either as slaves or freemen, to solve for us this most difficult\r\nproblem of the social equality of the white and black races. Where\r\nmarriage between them is unknown, such social equality cannot exist.\r\nEurope has an idea and a theory, but no practical knowledge of the\r\nsubject. We have the facts and experience. Efforts have been made here\r\nfor a century to establish this social equality, but the failure is\r\ncomplete. New England has devoted years of toil and thousands of dollars\r\nto accomplish this object, and the Quakers, and Franklin's Pennsylvania\r\nsociety, spared neither time nor money. Statesmen, philanthropists, and\r\nChristians have labored for years in the cause, but the case grows worse\r\nwith each succeeding census. State after State, including now a large\r\nmajority, forbid their introduction. The repugnance is invincible, and\r\nthe census of 1840 (as shown by the tables annexed to my Texas letter of\r\nJanuary, 1844) proved that one sixth of the negroes of the North are\r\nsupported by taxation of the whites--a sum which would soon colonize\r\nthem all. The free negroes, regarded here as an inferior caste, have no\r\nadequate motive for industry or exertion. Each year, as their numbers\r\naugment, intensifies the prejudice, invites collision in various\r\npursuits, with competition for wages, and renders colonization more\r\nnecessary. We must not any longer keep the free negro here in an\r\nexhausted receiver, or mix the races, as chemical ingredients in a\r\nlaboratory, for the edification of experimental philosophers. Such\r\nempiricism as regards the negro race, after our repeated failures, is\r\ncruel and unjust. We have made the trial here for nearly a century, and\r\nthe race continues to retrograde. Compare their progress and condition\r\nin America and Liberia, and what friend of the race or of humanity can\r\ndesire to retain them among us? The voice of nature and of experience\r\nproclaims, that America is our home and Africa is theirs; and let us, in\r\na spirit of true kindness and sympathy for them, obey the mandate.\r\n\r\nThere will soon be a great change among the free blacks on this subject.\r\nWhen Liberia shall expand and become a considerable power--when she\r\nshall have great marts of commerce, and her flag shall float in our\r\nharbors--when the Messages of her President, the reports of her Cabinet,\r\nthe debates in her Congress shall be read here, her ministers and\r\nconsuls be found among us, and the ambition of her race shall thus be\r\naroused, we shall probably have as great a negro exodus from our country\r\nto Africa, as there ever was from Europe to America.\r\n\r\nWhen the gold so profusely scattered through Africa shall reach our\r\nshores, as also her rich and varied products, when our reciprocal\r\ncommerce shall be counted by millions of dollars, the home of their\r\nancestors will present irresistible attractions to the negro race.\r\nCeasing to be menials and inferiors, they will then go where they will\r\nbe welcomed as citizens and rulers of a great republic. They will go\r\nwhere they govern themselves, and not where they are governed or\r\nenslaved by others. They will go where they give all the votes, and hold\r\nall the offices, and not where their exclusion is complete. They will go\r\nwhere the flag, the army, and navy, and government are theirs--and\r\ntheirs also the social position--equals among equals, peers among peers.\r\nThis they can never attain here: indeed, they will continue to\r\nretrograde, and become a mere element of social and political agitation.\r\nThe complete success of Liberia must extinguish African slavery, here,\r\nand throughout the world. Emigration there, is the true interest and\r\ndestiny of the negro race. Let us aid them to fulfil it. This is alike\r\nour interest and our duty. If they have been wronged here, let us pave\r\ntheir way with kindness and with gold on their return to the land of\r\ntheir forefathers. Let us aid them in building up there a great nation,\r\nwhich will call us blessed. Let the curse of slavery be forgotten, in\r\nthe prosperous career of a great and free Afric-American republic. Born\r\non our soil, let them transfer our language and institutions to Africa.\r\nOur material progress has been marvellous; but such an act, on our part,\r\nwould indicate a moral advance, that would greatly exalt us among\r\nnations. Every dollar thus expended, would come back to us with compound\r\ninterest, giving us also that which money cannot purchase, the\r\nconsolation of good deeds, the favor of Heaven, and the blessing of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nI have stated that so much of the overture made by Congress to the\r\nStates, as regards appropriations for colonizing abroad their free\r\nblacks, should be extended to the free, as well as the slave States.\r\nAmong the alleged evils of emancipation apprehended at the North, is the\r\nbelief that this policy would fill the free States with manumitted\r\nslaves. But, by extending the proposed compacts, so far as regards\r\ncolonization, to the free as well as the slave States, this result would\r\nnot only be arrested, but the number of free blacks in the North, as\r\nwell as the South, would soon be greatly diminished. The brutal assaults\r\nlately made by mobs on unoffending blacks in some of the free States is\r\ntruly disgraceful. It is, however, a warning of the fatal consequences\r\nof retaining the free blacks in the North, especially when, from\r\nincreasing density of population, or other causes, the struggle for\r\nsubsistence, and competition for work and wages, between whites and\r\nnegroes, should become general. In view of these facts, surely no friend\r\nof the negro race would persuade them to remain here.\r\n\r\n     NOTE.--This was printed before the President's emancipation\r\n     proclamation, but is not hostile to it, when accompanied by capture\r\n     or conquest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOLF HUNT.\r\n\r\n  AIR--'Una niña bonita y hermosa.'\r\n\r\n\r\n  We will ride to the wolf hunt together,\r\n    Where thousands must yield up their breath,\r\n  By the night, by the light--in all weather!\r\n    Then hurrah, for the wild hunt of death!\r\n  Where the deep cannon bays for our beagle,\r\n    Over mountain and valley we come,\r\n  While the death-fife now screams like an eagle\r\n        To the roll\r\n          and the roll\r\n            and the roll\r\n              and the roll of the drum.\r\n\r\n  Fatherland!--how the wild beasts are yelling!\r\n    Blood drips from each ravenous mouth;\r\n  Blood of brothers, each torn from his dwelling\r\n    By the wild, hungry wolves of the South.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS--Where the deep cannon bays for our beagle, &c.\r\n\r\n  Let them rave! for our rifles are ready;\r\n    Let them howl! for our sabres are keen;\r\n  And the nerve of the hunter is steady\r\n    When the track of the wére-wolf is seen.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS--Where the deep cannon bays for our beagle, &c.\r\n\r\n  Yes, the foul wolves have been o'er the border,\r\n    But the fields were piled high with their slain,\r\n  Till we drove them, in frantic disorder,\r\n    To their dark home of hunger again.\r\n\r\n  CHORUS--Where the deep cannon bays for our beagle, &c.\r\n\r\n  So we'll ride to the wolf hunt together,\r\n    Where the bullet stops many a breath,\r\n  By the night, by the light--in all weather,\r\n    To the wild Northern wolf hunt of death.\r\n  Where the deep cannon bays for our beagle,\r\n    Over mountain and valley we come;\r\n  While the death-fife now screams like an eagle\r\n        To the roll\r\n          and the roll\r\n            and the roll\r\n              and the roll of the drum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POETRY OF NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the many marvellous myths of antiquity, I know of none more\r\ndirectly applicable to Man and Art than that of the great struggle\r\nbetween Antæus the Earth-born and Hercules.\r\n\r\nLifted on high by brute force, Antæus is stifled; but falling and\r\ntouching Earth, he revives. Man, borne by the irresistible force of\r\ncircumstance, may become false, frivolous, and weak: his Art may dwindle\r\nto mere imitation, his Poetry turn to wailing and convulsions: but let\r\nhim once fall back to Nature--to the all-cherishing Earth, the Mother of\r\nBeauty--and all his Works and Songs become as seas, rivers, green\r\nleaves, and the music of birds.\r\n\r\nWe have too long needed the touch of fresh and holy Earth. Too long has\r\nour love of picture and poem, and of all that the glorious impulse _to\r\ncreate in beauty_ achieves, been fickle as the wind; based on discordant\r\nfancies and distorted tradition. Symbolism in art, at present means only\r\nan arbitrary and puerile substitution of one object or caprice for\r\nanother. The most successful poetic simile is often as thoroughly\r\nconventional, and consequently as perishable, as possible. In short, we\r\nare _not_ in an age when there is one poetry alike for _all_ men; when\r\nthe artist and bard are _truly_ great and honored, and their works\r\nregarded as the Best that man can do. The few who comprehend this in all\r\nits sad significance look from their towers tearfully forth into the\r\ndark night, and wail, 'Great PAN is dead!'\r\n\r\nBut he is not dead, nor sleepeth. He will yet return in that awful dawn\r\nof the day which will know no end. Already faint gleams of its glory\r\ngild the steep hills, the high places, and the groves sacred of old to\r\nthe Starry Queen, and a reviving breath sweeps from the blue sea,\r\ncalling up in ruined fane, and on the green turf where once stood\r\ntemples in the olden time, fresh ideals of those forms of ineffable\r\nbeauty, faun and fay, born of the primeval myth. There is already a\r\nquivering in the ancient graves, and strange lights flicker over the\r\nmighty stones consecrated by tradition to incantations, not of morbid\r\nfears, but of the strong and beautiful in nature. For in the\r\nUtilitarianism, in the steam and machinery of 'this age without faith,'\r\nI see the first necessary step of a return to real needs, solid facts,\r\nand natural laws. It is the first part of the doing away with rococo\r\nsentimentalisms, mediæval tatters, and all wretched and ragged\r\nremainders and reminders of states of society which have nothing in\r\ncommon with our present needs. And it will be a revival, not of the\r\nancient adoration of Nature as a mythology and a superstition, but as a\r\nheartfelt love of all that is beautiful, and joyous, and healthy in\r\nitself. Then the gods will indeed return and live again among us; not as\r\nliteral beings, however, but as blessings in all that is best for man.\r\nNor will 'Romance' be wanting--that influence which the age, without\r\ndefining, still declares is essential to poetry. In Science, in\r\nHumanity, and in perfecting human ties and interests by the influence of\r\nlove, there exists a romance which is exquisitely fascinating, and which\r\nlends itself to tenderer and more graceful dreams than Trouveur or\r\nMinnesinger _of any age_ ever knew--dreams the more delightful because\r\nthey will not fade away with the mists of morning, but be fulfilled in\r\nclear sunlight, line by line, before man.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to prove what I have here asserted of this tendency\r\ntoward the Real in modern literature and art. Within twenty, nay, within\r\nten years, men of genius have abandoned the Supernatural and the Gothic\r\nas affording fit themes for creative efforts. That unfortunate creature\r\nthe Ghost--especially the Ghost in Armor--as well as the Historical or\r\nSensational personages who live only in the superlative--are at present\r\nin general demand only by that harmless class who read 'for\r\nentertainment,' and even they are beginning to ungratefully mock their\r\nold friends. It is not difficult to foresee that the Romance so dear to\r\nthe last generation will soon become the exclusive heritage of the\r\nvulgar. Meanwhile, genial sketches of fresh, unaffected Nature, draughts\r\nfrom real life, are beginning to be loved with keen zest. What novels\r\nare so successful as those in which the writer has truthfully mirrored\r\nthe heart or the home? What pictures are so loved as those which set\r\nbefore us the Real, or, rather, the Ideal in its true meaning--that of\r\nthe perfected essence of the Real?\r\n\r\nWhen this tendency shall have fairly placed man on the right road--when\r\nwe shall have learned to follow and set forth Nature as she is, in\r\nspirit and in truth, the great cherishing mother, ever young, ever\r\njoyous, of all beauty and all pleasure, then we may anticipate the last\r\nand greatest era of human culture. Then we may hope for a more than\r\nGreek art--an art freed from every strain of oppression and injustice.\r\nTo effect this we must, however, do what the earliest founders of poetry\r\nfind mythology did: search Nature closely, bear constantly in mind her\r\none great principle of potent Being, continually displaying itself in\r\nall things as life and death, mutually creating each other, and acting\r\nin all organic life by the mystery of Love, Then, while establishing\r\nthose affinities and correspondences between natural objects which\r\nconstitute Poetry, let it be ever present to the mind that each is, so\r\nto speak, always polarized with its positive end of activity, creation\r\nor birth, and its negative of cessation, decay and death. It is by the\r\nconstant _realization_ of this solemn and beautiful truth in all things\r\nthat Nature eventually appears so strengthening and cheerful. The flower\r\nand the fruit, the delight of anticipation and the luxury of\r\nrealization, are the delightful culmination of every natural existence;\r\nand it is to perfect these that all action tends. Decay, disease, pain,\r\nand death, are only kindly agencies acting more effectually and rapidly,\r\nto sweep away that which is fading, and hasten it into new forms of\r\nbeauty and pleasure.\r\n\r\n  'Nature within her placid breast receives\r\n  All her creation; and the body pays\r\n  Itself the due of nature, and its end\r\n  Is self-consummated.'[A]\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: LUCAN, _Pharsalia_.]\r\n\r\nBirth is thus an essential part of death, and death of birth--both\r\nforming, by their inseparable action, the highest and first intelligible\r\nstage of the inscrutable mystery of the active power of Nature. 'This,'\r\nthe reader may say, 'is, however, only the old theme, worn threadbare by\r\npoet and moralist.' Let him look more earnestly into it--let him\r\n_master_ it, and he will find it the germ of a deeper, a bolder, and a\r\nmore genial Art than the world has known for ages. It is no slander on\r\nthe intellect or sensibility of this day to say that its admiration for\r\nNature is really at a low ebb, and that, with thousands even of the\r\neducated, nothing gives so little solid satisfaction as lovely\r\nscenery or other inartificially beautiful phenomena. The reason\r\nis that Poetry--the hymn which _should_ elevate the soul in\r\nNature-worship--instead of reflecting in every simile, every image,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, the deep mystery of life which intuitively\r\nassociates with itself that of love and all loveliness, is satisfied\r\nwith mere _comparisons_ based on casual and petty resemblance. The\r\nreader or critic of modern times, when the poet speaks of 'rosy-fingered\r\ndawn,' or of 'cheeks like damask roses,' is quite satisfied with the\r\naccuracy of the simile as to delicate color, and with the refined, vague\r\nassociation of perfume and of individual memories attached to the\r\nflower. But if we could realize by even the dimmest hint that the mind\r\nof the poet was penetrated and filled by the knowledge that the rose was\r\na flower-favorite of man in all lands in primeval ages, and, as Geology\r\nasserts, literally coeval with him; that its points of resemblance to\r\nwoman properly gave it place in the oldest mythology as the floral\r\ntype of the female godhead; that it was the earth-born reflection\r\nof the morning star, and rose from the foam with it when the\r\nAphrodite-Astarte-Venus-Anadyomeno came to life; that, as the nearest\r\nsymbol of beautiful virginity expanding into womanhood and maternity, it\r\nwas appropriately allied to dawning life and light, and consequently to\r\nthe rosy Aurora and to blushing youth; and that finally, in withered\r\nage, set around by sharp thorns, it is a striking likeness of wounding\r\ndeath, yet from which new roses may spring--we should find that in a\r\nknowledge of all these interchangable symbolisms lies a music and a\r\ncolor, a perfume and a feeling, as of a perfectly satisfactory Thought.\r\nLet it be observed that each of these rose-correspondences is directly\r\nbased on Nature, and that, to a mind familiar with the antithetic\r\nidentity of life and death, all are promptly soluble and mutually\r\nconvertible, as by mental-magic alchemy. There is a truth and\r\nearnestness in them which, while stimulating the joyous sentiment, gives\r\nto every allusion to the rose the value of genius, and not of accident\r\nor the _chic_ of a 'happy idea.'\r\n\r\nBut with the rose there are a thousand beautiful objects all consecrated\r\nby myth and legend, based on deeply-seated affinities, all reflecting\r\nthe solemn mystery of birth and death in unity, all expressing love and\r\npleasure, and all mutually convertible one into the other. All the\r\ndifferently-named Venuses, yes, all the goddesses of ancient mythology,\r\nare but _one_ Venus and one goddess--all gods blend in one Arch-Bel, or\r\n'Belerus old,' of myriad names--he, the inscrutable Abyss,\r\nself-developing into male and female--who is reflected again in every\r\nobject which springs from them. All mountains meet in 'the solemn\r\nmystery of the guarded mount'--the lily teaches the same lessons as the\r\nrose and the sea shell--each and all are seen in the light ark which\r\nskims the waves, or floats high in heaven as the pearly-horned moon; and\r\nthen the dew of the morning and the foaming sea become the wine of life\r\nand the honey of the flower, and they are found again in the\r\nCUP. So on through all beautiful forms, whether of nature or of\r\nthe simpler creations of man--wherever we meet one, there, to the eye of\r\nhim who has studied the purely natural science of symbolism, is a full\r\ngarden of flowers of thought. Once master the primary solution of the\r\ngreat problem, once learn the method of its application, and every\r\nflower and simple attribute of life becomes invested with deep\r\nsignificance and earnest, passionate beauty. But this can be no half-way\r\nstudy, to be modified or qualified by prejudices. Do you seek, thirst\r\nfor Truth, O reader? Dare you grasp it without blanching, without\r\nblushing? Then cast away _all_ the loathsome littleness which has rusted\r\nand fouled around you, and look at Nature as she literally _is_, in her\r\nnaked beauty, conceiving and forming, quickening and warming into\r\ninfinitely varied and lovely life, and then _forming_ once again with\r\nthe strong and harsh influences of death, pain and decay. It avails\r\nnothing to be squeamish and timid in the tremendous laboratory of Truth.\r\nThere is but little account taken of your parlor-propriety in the depths\r\nof ocean, where wild sea-monsters engender, where the million-tonned\r\ncoral-rock rises to be crowned with palms, amid swaying tides and\r\ncurrents which cast up in a night leagues of sandy peninsulas. Little\r\nheed is taken of your prudish scruples or foul follies, where the\r\nscreaming eagle chases his mate on the road of the mad North-wind;\r\nlittle care for _your_ pitiful perversions of health and truth into\r\nscurvy jests or still scurvier blushes, wherever life takes new form as\r\nlife, ever begetting through the endless chain of being. There is no\r\nlearning a little and leaving the rest, for him who would explore the\r\nfountain-springs of Poetry and of Nature. The true poet, like the true\r\nman of science, cannot limit vision and thought to a handful of twigs or\r\na cluster of leaves. In the minutest detail he recalls the roots, trunk,\r\nand branches--the smallest part is to him a reflection of the whole, and\r\nformed by the same laws.\r\n\r\nThe great minds of the early mythologic and hitherto Unknown Age had\r\nthis advantage in shaping that stupendous _Lehre_ or lore which embraced\r\nunder the same laws, mythology, language, science, poetry, and art--they\r\nmodified nothing and avoided nothing for fear of shocking conventional\r\nand artificial feelings. Nature was to them what she was to\r\nherself--_literal_. The great law of reproduction, around whose primary\r\nstage gathers all that is attractive or beautiful in organic life; the\r\n'moment' _toward_ which everything blossoms, and _from_ which everything\r\nfades, was not by them ignored as non-existent, or treated in paltry\r\nequivoque, as though it were a secondary consequence and a vile\r\ncorruption, instead of a healthy cause. Their science was, it is true,\r\nonly founded on observation (and therefore easily warped to error by\r\n_apparent_ analogies) instead of induction, while their æsthetics had\r\nthe same illusive basis; and yet, by fearlessly following the great\r\n_manifest_ laws of organic life, they were enabled to lay the\r\nfoundations of all which in later ages came to perfection in the Hindu\r\nMahabarata, and Sacrintala--in Greek statues, and, it may be, in Greek\r\nhumanity--in Norse Eddas, and Druidic mysteries. All of these, and, with\r\nthem, all that Phoenician, Etruscan, and Egyptian gave to beauty, owe\r\ntheir origin to the fearless incarnation in early times of the manifest\r\nlaws of Nature in myth, song, and legend. He who would feel Nature as\r\nthey felt it--a real, quickening presence, a thrilling, wildly beautiful\r\nlife, inspiring the Moerad to madness by the intensity of rushing\r\nmountain torrent and passionately rustling leaves, a spirit breathing a\r\ngod into every gray old rock and an exquisite _love_ into every\r\nflower--should take up the clue which these old myths afford, and follow\r\nit to the end. Then the Hidden in forgotten lore will be revealed to\r\nhim, the Orgie and Mystery will yield to him all, and more than all,\r\nthey gave to Pythagoras of old. He will hold the key to every faith--nay\r\nmore, he will form and feel new faiths for himself in studying mountains\r\nand seas. To him the cliff, high-rising above the foaming tide, the\r\nserpent gliding through the summer grass, the cool dark woodland path\r\nwinding into arching leafy shadows, the brook and the narrow rocky pass,\r\nthe red sunset and the crimson flower, gnarled roots and caverns, lakes,\r\npromontories, and headlands, will all have a strange meaning--not vague\r\nand mystical, but literal and expressive--a mutual and self-reflecting\r\nmeaning, embodying all of the Beautiful that man loves best in life, and\r\nconsecrated by the exquisite fables of a joyous mythology.\r\n\r\nI have long thought that a work devoted to the natural poetry and\r\nantique mystery of such objects as occur most prominently in Nature\r\nwould be acceptable to all lovers of the Beautiful. It would be worth\r\nthe while, I should think, to all such, to know that every object, by\r\nland or sea, was once the subject of a myth, that this myth had a\r\nmeaning founded in the deepest laws of life, and that all were curiously\r\nconnected and mutually reflected in one vast system. It would be worth\r\nwhile to know, not only that dove and goblet, flower and ring were each\r\nthe 'motive' of a graceful fable, but also that this fable was something\r\nmore than merely fanciful or graceful--that it had a deep meaning, and\r\nthat each and all were essential parts of one vast whole. And it would\r\nbe pleasant, I presume, to see these myths and meanings somewhat\r\nillustrated by poem or proverb, or other literary ornament. What is here\r\noffered is, indeed, little more than a beginning--for the actual\r\ncompletion of such a work would involve the learning and labor, not of a\r\nman, but of an age. I trust, however, that these chapters may induce\r\nsome curiosity and research into the marvels and mysteries of antique\r\nsymbolism, and perhaps invest with a new interest many objects hitherto\r\nvalued more for their external attractions than for their associations.\r\n\r\nThe reading world has for many years received with favor works\r\npurporting to teach with poetic illustration the Language of Flowers.\r\nBut we learn from ancient lore that there is a secret language and a\r\nsymbolism, not only of flowers, but of _all_ natural objects. These\r\nobjects, on one side, or from one point of view, all stand for each\r\nother, and are, in fact, synonymes--the whole representing singly the\r\nVenus-mystery of love and generation, or _life_. That is to say, this is\r\nwhat they do _positively_--for negatively, at the same time, and under\r\nthe same forms, they also typify death, repulsion, darkness--even as the\r\nsame word in Hebrew often means unity or harmony when read backward, and\r\nthe reverse when taken forward. Why they represent _opposites_ (the\r\ngreat opposites of existence, life and death, lust and loathing,\r\ndarkness and light) is evident enough to any one who will reflect that\r\neach was intended to represent in itself all Nature, and that in Nature\r\nthe great mystery of mysteries is the springing of death from life and\r\nof life from death by means of the agency of sexual action through\r\nvitality and light.\r\n\r\nI would beg the reader to constantly bear in mind this fact when\r\nstudying the symbolism and mythology of Nature--that among the ancients\r\nevery object, beginning with the serpent, typified _all that is_, or all\r\nNature, and consequently the opposites of Death and Life, united in one,\r\nas also the male and female principle, darkness and light, sleep and\r\nwaking, and, in fact, _all_ antagonisms. Even when, as in the case of\r\nthe goat, the wild boar, or the Typhon serpent of the waters,\r\ndestruction is more peculiarly implied, the fact that destruction is\r\nsimply a preparation for fresh life was never forgotten. The destroying,\r\nundulating, wavy serpent of the waters was _also_ the type of life, and\r\nwound around the staff of Escalapius as a healing emblem, recalling the\r\nbrazen serpent of Moses. In like manner the Tree of Life or of Knowledge\r\nwas the tree also of Death, or of Good and of Evil, _arbor cogniti boni\r\net mali_, and, according to the Rabbis, of sexual generation, from\r\neating of which the first parents became self-conscious. Beans, which\r\nwere symbols of impurity and peculiarly identified with evil\r\n(MENKE, _De Leguminibus Veterum_, Gottingen, 1814), were also\r\ntypical of supporting life and of reviving spring and light. To see all\r\nreflected in each, and each in all, is, in fact, the key to all the\r\nmysteries of symbolism and the clue to the whole poetry of Nature.\r\n\r\nI propose in the following chapters to discuss the poetry and mystery of\r\nflowers, herbs, and other objects, and give not only their ancient\r\nsignification, but also their more modern meaning, as set forth in song\r\nand in tradition.\r\n\r\n  THE ROSE.\r\n\r\n  'I felix Rosa, mollibusque sertis\r\n  Nostri cinge comas Apollinaris.\r\n  Quas tu nectere candidas, sed olim,\r\n  Sic te semper amet Venus, memento!'\r\n\r\n  MARTIAL, Epig. 88, lib. 7.\r\n\r\nAmong the most exquisite outbreathings of feeling in Nature we have the\r\nRose. Many flowers are in certain senses more beautiful, but as, among\r\nwomen, she who charms is not always the most highly gifted with\r\nconventional attractions, so it is with the Queen of the Garden, whose\r\nproud simplicity is delicately blended with a familiar, friendly grace,\r\nwhich wins by the tenderest spell of association.\r\n\r\nOf all flowers, of all ages, in every land, the Rose has ever been most\r\nintimately connected with humanity--a sentiment so earnestly expressed\r\nand so lovingly repeated in the poetry, art, and myths of the olden\r\ntime, that it would seem as if tradition had once recorded what science\r\nhas only recently discovered, that this plant was coeval with Man.\r\nInferior, indeed, to the sacred Lotus as a religious symbol, the Rose\r\nhas always been superior to her sister of the silent waters as\r\nexpressing the most delicate mysteries of Beauty and of Love. The Lotus,\r\nthe only rival of the Rose in the early Nature-worship,[A] furnished\r\nindeed in its name alone a solemn formula of faith which has been more\r\nfrequently repeated than any other on earth. It was the flower of\r\nmystery, the primeval emblem of Pantheism in beauty, the blossom of the\r\nMorning Land. But the Rose belongs to the revellers and lovers in\r\nPersia, to the worship and banquets of the joyous Greeks, to those who\r\nmeet in gardens by moonlight beside fountains, the children of Aphrodite\r\nthe Foam-born.\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: The Lotus was to the Egyptian and Hindu not only an image\r\nof physical life, but of life in all its strength and splendor, the type\r\nof the generating and forming force of Nature in itself, expressing the\r\nidea of 'water, health, life.' The Hindu imagined in its form the whole\r\nearth, swimming like the lotus on water; the pistils represent Mount\r\nMeru (the world's central point and the Indian Olympus), the stamens are\r\nthe peaks of the surrounding mountains, the four central leaves of its\r\ncrown are the four great divisions of the earth, according to the four\r\npoints of the compass, while the other leaves represented the circles of\r\nthe earth surrounding India. On the lotus is throned Brahma the creator,\r\nand Lakshmi, the goddess of all blessings.\r\n\r\n_Die Symbolik und Mythologie der Natur_, VON J. B. FRIEDERICH,\r\nWürzburg, 1859.]\r\n\r\nFrom the earliest age the World of Thought has been disputed by two\r\nSpirits, and none are mightier than they. One, fearful in mysterious\r\nbeauty, the Queen of all that is occult and inscrutable, rises in cloudy\r\nstate from the antique Orient--from the Egypt of the Only Isis, and from\r\nthe Avatar land of Brahma--solemnly breathing the love of the All in\r\nOne. Infinitely lovely is the dark-browed Queen, and she bears in her\r\nhand the lotus. Against her, in laughing sunlight, amid green leaves and\r\nbirdsong, waving merry warning, stands a brighter form--the incarnation\r\nof purely earthly beauty--for she is all of earth and life; the Spirit\r\nof the Actual and Material; and she is crowned with roses.\r\n\r\nThese are the Thought-Queens of Greece and India, of France and of\r\nGermany. But the Christianity of the middle ages declared that the\r\nflower was neither a Rose nor Lotus, and placed in the hand of its Queen\r\nof Heaven the Lily of Martyrdom!\r\n\r\nDear reader, sit among green leaves until the birds no longer fear you;\r\nor else peer from some quiet corner into your June garden, so that you\r\nmay watch its blossoms unobserved--as the little damsel in the Danish\r\ntale did the dancing lilies. When the fever of life and self grows calm,\r\na feeling will steal over you, as of wonder, that the flowers seem to be\r\nbreathing and beautying _for themselves_, and not for man. A pure, holy\r\nlife, quite apart from all ultimate destinies of bouquets and wreaths\r\nand human uses, seems to prevail among them. Each has its expression,\r\nits ineffably tender idea, not more clearly formulized, it is true, than\r\nthose which music conveys, yet quite as delicious. One might say that\r\nthey seem to talk together; but they do not think as we think or dream\r\nas we dream--not even symbolically. It will be long ere you appreciate\r\nmore than their fresh joy of existence. But, little by little one herb\r\nand flower after the other becomes individualized--they are artists\r\nliving themselves out into hues and lines and parts of a tableau; the\r\nvine draws itself in an arabesque which is perfect _because_\r\nself-forming; and the whole harmonize with the sway of sunlight and\r\nshadow, with rustling breeze and hurrying ant on the footpath, and\r\nchirping birds, so exquisitely that you may feel, as you never have in\r\nstudying human art or in poetry, that tones, colors, curves, organisms\r\n_form_ altogether, or separately, the effect of each other. If among\r\nthem all there be a Rose, you will then find _why_ it was that she was\r\nFlower Queen in Eden, and in all ages. No matter what rivals are\r\npresent, the Rose will first suggest _Woman_--Woman in her most\r\nexquisite loveliness.\r\n\r\nWe find, indeed, in detail, that no flower furnishes so many obvious\r\npoints of comparison to a fair girl. Its delicate tints of white and red\r\nare suggestive of her complexion, the bud is like prettily pouting lips,\r\nwhile the exquisite perfume is, especially among the excitable children\r\nof the East, the most daintily piquant of exotic stimulants. The\r\nNature-worship of the early ages, which saw in all things the action of\r\nthe male and female principles of generation, did not fail to discover\r\nin the mossy rose (as it had done in the cup, the ring, the gate, the\r\nmountain-path, and every other imaginable type of opening, passing\r\nthrough, and receiving) a striking symbol of the Queen of Love, and of\r\nher chief attribute. In accordance with the first rule of the first\r\nreligion, which was to identify the male and female godheads in the\r\nProducer, they also discovered in the Rosebud a symbol of the male\r\nprinciple, or of germinating life, from which unchanged word, as has\r\nbeen thought, the name of Buddh' or Buddha was given--or taken.\r\n\r\nAs the flower dearest to Venus and the Graces--nay, in a certain sense,\r\nthe very Venus herself, dew-dripping and odorous, the Rose soon shed the\r\nAurora light to which it was compared, and its winning perfume, over\r\nevery antique dream of love and beauty. It rises with the sea-foam when\r\nAphrodite comes in pearly whiteness from the blue waters; or it is born\r\nof the blood of the dying Adonis when he--the type of summer\r\nbeauty--dies by the tusk of the boar, the emblem of winter, of\r\ndestruction, and of death; or it springs from the exquisitely pure and\r\nsacred drops incarnadine of the goddess herself when scratched by\r\nthorns, in pursuit of her darling. And as among the ancients, whether\r\nEtruscan or Egyptian, it was usual to celebrate the rites of Venus\r\nduring banquets, the rose, with which the revellers and their goblets\r\nwere crowned, became also the symbol of Dionysus--or of Bacchus. And as\r\nsilence should be especially kept as to the secret pleasures of love and\r\nthe favors of fair ladies, as well as to what is uttered when heated by\r\nwine, the rose was also hung up at all orgies to intimate\r\nsilence--whence the expression _sub rosa_, 'under the rose.' And\r\ntherefore Harpocrates, the god of silence and mystery (or of the secret\r\nproductive force of Nature), bears this flower--the first emblem of\r\n'still life'--silence as to the joys of love and wine.\r\n\r\n  'Let us the Rose of Love entwine\r\n  Round the cheek-flushed god of wine:\r\n  As the rose its gaudy leaves\r\n  Round our twisted temples weaves,\r\n  Let us sip the time away,\r\n  Let us laugh as blithe as they.\r\n\r\n  'Rose, oh rose, the gem of flowers!\r\n  Rose, the care of vernal hours!\r\n  Rose, of every god the joy!\r\n  With roses Venus' darling boy\r\n  Links the Graces in a round\r\n  With him in flowery fetters bound.\r\n\r\n  'With roses, Bacchus, crown my head:\r\n  The lyre in hand thy courts I'll tread,\r\n  And, with some full-bosomed maid,\r\n  Dance, nodding with the rosy braid,\r\n  That veils me with its clustered shade.'\r\n\r\n  ANACREON.\r\n\r\nThe study of mythologic symbolism gives a thousand indications that in\r\nprehistoric ages, among the worshippers of the Serpent and the Fire, all\r\nthe deepest feelings of men, whether artistic, religious, or sensual,\r\nwere concentrated on the real or fancied affinities of natural objects\r\nwith an earnestness of which we of the present age have no conception.\r\nPoetry, as it exists for us, is a pretty rococo fancy; to the\r\nworshippers and framers of myths it was a truth of tremendous\r\nsignificance. To such minds a Rose freshly blowing was a symbol, not\r\nmerely of Divinity in a barren, abstract manner, but of Divinity in its\r\nmost vivid and fascinating forms. It was GOD, male and female,\r\nmanifested as love, as perfume, and as light. Believing that every\r\nflower on earth was the reflection of an arch-typal star in heaven, they\r\nhonored the Rose by holding that as a flower it was generated by and\r\nreflected the sun, and the morning star, and, in fact, the moon also.\r\nSo, in a poem of the Arab Meflana Dschelaledin:\r\n\r\n  'The full rose, in its glory, is like the sun,\r\n  Thou seest all its leaves, each like unto the moon.'\r\n\r\nIt was therefore one of the flowers of Light. Its color was that of the\r\nAurora--not in Homer alone, but in all ancient song, Dawn is\r\nrosy-fingered, rosy-hued. This resemblance to the morning is beautifully\r\nset forth by Ausonius:\r\n\r\n  'There Pæstan roses blushed before my view,\r\n  Bedropped with early morning's freshening dew;\r\n  'Twere doubtful if the blossoms of the rose\r\n  Had robbed the morning, or the morning those:\r\n  In dew, in tint the same, the star and flower,\r\n  For both confess the Queen of Beauty's power.\r\n  Perchance their sweets the same; but this more nigh\r\n  Exhales its breath, while that embalms the sky:\r\n  Of flower and star the goddess is the same,\r\n  And both she tinged with hues of roseate flame.'\r\n\r\nAs the warmest floral type of love, of light, of revelling, and of the\r\nglowing dawn, the Rose became naturally the symbol of Youth. Here again,\r\nsome decided resemblance was, as usual, required, and it was found in\r\nthe Blush, the most characteristic, as well as the most beautiful,\r\nindication of affinity in early life between the moral and physical\r\nnature. Youth is the rose-time of love, the June of its summer; its\r\nhours are those of the morning-star of life, and of its dawn; the lover\r\nis the bud, the bride the blushing flower expanding in perfume. Every\r\nresemblance in it refers to _incipient_ life. The Bud is GOD,\r\nor Buddh', as the procreating deity, while the opening flower is the\r\nconceiving Aphrodite. All is early and transitory. The tendency of roses\r\nto quickly fade has given the poets of every land a most obvious simile\r\nfor 'fleeting youth.'\r\n\r\n    'Go, lovely rose!\r\n  Tell her that wastes her time and me,\r\n    That now she knows,\r\n  When I resemble her to thee,\r\n  How sweet and fair she seems to be!\r\n\r\n   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    'Then die, that she\r\n  The common fate of all things rare\r\n    May read in thee--\r\n  How small a part of time they share\r\n  That are so wondrous sweet and rare.'\r\n\r\nIn connection with youth, freshness, and blushes, the rose became,\r\nnaturally enough, a type of reality and of natural truth. So in Hafiz:\r\n\r\n  'Can cheeks where living roses blow,\r\n  Where nature spreads her richest dyes,\r\n  Require the borrowed gloss of Art?'\r\n\r\nThe deepest and most solemn mystery which the Nature-love of the\r\nearliest times attached to every object, was that it reflected its very\r\nopposite, and must always be regarded as identified with it in a\r\nprimitive origin, in which both existed undeveloped. So we have seen\r\nthat the rose, while female as the _expanding_ flower, was yet male as\r\nthe _contracted_ bud. As a symbol of joyousness, youth, light, beauty,\r\nand the blushing dawn, it was eminently the floral type of _life_--a\r\nsimile which has been employed by the poets of every land, Spenser among\r\nothers:\r\n\r\n  'The whiles some one did chant this lovely lay:\r\n  Ah see, who so fair thing dost fain to see,\r\n  In springing flower the image of thy day;\r\n  All see thy virgin ROSE, how sweetly she\r\n  Doth first peep forth with bashful modesty,\r\n  That fairer seems the less you see her may;\r\n  Lo! see soon after, how more bold and free\r\n  Her bared bosom she doth broad display;\r\n  Lo! see soon after, how she fades and falls away.\r\n\r\n  'So passeth, in the passing of a day\r\n  Of mortal life, the leaf, the bud, the flower,\r\n  Nor more doth flourish after first decay,\r\n  That erst was sought to deck both bed and bower\r\n  Of many a lady, many a paramour:\r\n  Gather the rose of love while yet in time,\r\n  Whilst loving thou may'st loved be with equal crime.'\r\n\r\nBut, as implying Life, the Rose also reflected Death, and this seemed to\r\nray from the cruel thorns, which, as the German couplet says, remain\r\nafter the leaves have vanished:\r\n\r\n  'The rose falls away,\r\n  But the thorns ever stay.'\r\n\r\nAnd a far older Hindu proverb solemnly exclaims: 'Hast thou obtained thy\r\nwish; exult not: canst thou not see how the thorn pierces the finger at\r\nthe same instant when the rose is gathered?'\r\n\r\nBirth and Death, as typified in the Rose, and their mutual production,\r\nare beautifully expressed by Ausonius in the remainder of the poem\r\nalready cited:\r\n\r\n  'I saw a moment's interval divide\r\n  The rose that blossomed from the rose that died.\r\n  _This_ with its cap of tufted moss looked green;\r\n  _That_, tipped with reddening purple, peeped between;\r\n  One reared its obelisk with opening swell,\r\n  The bud unsheathed its crimson pinnacle;\r\n  Another, gathering every purpled fold,\r\n  Its foliage multiplied; its blooms unrolled,\r\n  The teeming chives shot forth; the petals spread;\r\n  The bow-pot's glory reared its smiling head;\r\n  While this, that ere the passing moment flew\r\n  Flamed forth one blaze of scarlet on the view,\r\n  Now shook from withering stalk the waste perfume,\r\n  Its verdure stript, and pale its faded bloom,\r\n  I marvelled at the spoiling flight of time,\r\n  That roses thus grew old in earliest prime.\r\n  E'en while I speak, the crimson leaves drop round,\r\n  And a red brightness veils the blushing ground.\r\n  These forms, these births, these changes, bloom, decay,\r\n  Appear and vanish in the self-same day.\r\n  The flower's brief grace, O Nature! moves my sighs,\r\n  Thy gifts, just shown, are ravished from our eyes.\r\n  One day the rose's age; and while it blows\r\n  In dawn of youth, it withers to its close.\r\n  The rose the glittering sun beheld at morn,\r\n  Spread to the light its blossoms newly born,\r\n  When in his round he looks from evening skies\r\n  Already droops in age, and fades, and dies.\r\n  Yet blest that, soon to fade, the numerous flower\r\n  Succeeds herself, and still prolongs her hour.\r\n  O virgins! roses cull, while yet ye may;\r\n  So bloom your hours, and so shall haste away.'\r\n\r\nA Jewish legend declares that a famed cabalist was vainly pursued by\r\nDeath through many forms. But at last the grim enemy changed himself\r\ninto the perfume of a rose, which the magician--his suspicion lulled for\r\nthe instant--inhaled, and died. In many German cities--Hildesheim,\r\nBremen, and Lübeck among others--it is said that the death of a prebend\r\nis heralded by the discovery of a white rose under his seat in the\r\ncathedral. 'And,' as J. B. Friederich states (_Symbolik und Mythologie\r\nder Natur_, p. 225), 'in the Tyrol the rose has a _deathly_ meaning,\r\nsince it is there believed that whoever wears an Alpine rose in his hat\r\nduring a thunderstorm will be struck by the lightning; for which reason\r\nit is called the thunder-rose--a name probably derived from the\r\nconsecration of that flower to Donar, the god of thunder.'\r\n\r\nThe fantastic symbolism of the middle ages twined the Rose into\r\ninnumerable capricious forms, few of which, however, have any direct\r\nderivation from _Nature_. Thus the Rose, from being typical of literal\r\nlove, became that of Christ; from symbolizing the light of Aurora, it\r\nwas made significant as the rose-window bearing the cross. The\r\nfive-leaved rose indicated the love of GOD for Man, as set\r\nforth by His five wounds; while the eight-leaved typified that of the\r\nbeliever for the Lord. The Rose also emblemed the Virgin Mary, and from\r\nher was reflected through countless works of art and many legends, all\r\nof which are 'tenderly beautiful,' and, it may be added, generally\r\nrather silly--as, for instance, that of the holy friar Josbert of Doel,\r\nwho sang daily five hymns in honor of the Virgin; in reward of which,\r\nimmediately after his death, there grew from his mouth, ears, and\r\nnostrils, five roses, each marked with the words of a hymn. It has been\r\nusual to say much, of late years, of the 'child-like and earnest,'\r\n'tender and trusting' spirit which inspired these saintly legends, and\r\nto praise with them the morbid delicacy of a Fra Angelico. Believe me,\r\nreader, when I say that no vigorous and healthy mind ever passed through\r\na period of adoration for and cultivation of mediæval Roman Catholic\r\nArt, who did not eventually see that this _naïve_ and innocent\r\nart-expression of the foulest, darkest, and most oppressive stage of\r\nhistory, had precisely the same foundation in truth as the love of the\r\nFrench court during the days of the Regency for a shepherd's life and\r\nchild-like rural pleasures. A wicked and degraded age seeks for relief\r\nin contemplating its opposite; a healthy one--like the Greek--glories in\r\nitself, and strives to raise self to the highest standard of truth and\r\nbeauty. None of the symbolisms of the middle ages grew directly from\r\n_Nature_--it was based on second-hand reveries, and on emblems from\r\nwhich all juice and life had been drained ages before in the East.\r\n\r\nYes--look at the beautiful Rose, radiant with dewdrops, ruddy in the\r\nmorning light, or dreamily lovely, with the moonbeams melting through\r\nher moon-shaped petals. Unchanged since that primeval age when she was a\r\nliving idol--a visible and blest presence of the Great Goddess of beauty\r\nand love--whether as Astarte or Ma Nerf Baaltis, Ashtaroth or Venus. Let\r\nher breathe in her fragrance of the far times when millions in a strange\r\nand busy age now forgotten thronged rose-garlanded to the temples; when,\r\nbearing roses, they gathered to wild worship at the Feast of the New\r\nMoon, under shady groves or in picturesque high places among the ancient\r\nrocks. Rose-breathing, rose-perfumed, amid sweetest music and black\r\nAssyrian eyes, in the gliding dance under thousands of brazen serpent\r\nlamps, or far in dusky fragrant forests, they adored the Rose Queen--the\r\nvery visible spirit and incarnation of nature in her loveliest form.\r\nOver many a shining sea passed the barks, rose-wreathed, to the far\r\nisles of the South: she--the Rose--was there! From many a steep crag\r\nlooked out on the blue ocean the temple of the Star Queen, the Heaven\r\nand Sea-born sister of the Rose: and she was there. Through beautiful\r\ntemples the lover strayed to meet his love, and, taking the rose from\r\nher brow, won her in worship of the Serpent-light of Loveliness: for\r\nshe, the Rose--the Mystery of all Rapture--was ever there! On coin and\r\njewel, in prayer and song they bore the Rose-Venus to every land in a\r\nliving, ever-thrilling romaunt--far goldener, more thrilling with poetry\r\nthan was in later times the dull lay of De Loris and Clopinel: for\r\nwherever man found joy and beauty in life, feast, and song, she--the\r\nRose Incarnate--was there. In the Rose was the twin sister of all the\r\nmysteries: we may read them as clearly in her, if we will, as ever did\r\nrapt Sidonian, or priest, or daughter of the Aryan, or whatever the\r\nearly unknown burning race may have been, which built fire-towers in\r\nmelting Lesbos, and names Cor-on, the crowned Corinthos, ere yet a\r\nsyllable of Greek had ever rung on earth. She is the Cup; her calyx and\r\ndew reflect the goblet of life, and the nectar-wine of life, typical in\r\nearly times of endless generation, in later days of _re_-generation.\r\nBorn of the sea, she recalls the Cor-olla Cup-Ark in which\r\nHercules--Arech El Es--crossed the sea between the rosy dawn and ruddy\r\nsundown, 'strength upborne by love and life.' She is the Morning Star\r\nwhich hovered over Aphrodite when the Queen rose from the sea, since\r\neach was either in that Trinity; as in later days the star shone on him\r\nwho rose from Maria the sea, accompanied by _Iona_, the dove. She is the\r\nShell and the Ark of so many ancient legends--that Ark into which life\r\nenters, and from which it is born--the Ark of Earth, in which Adon and\r\nthe flowers sleep till Spring--the Ark of maternal Being, from which man\r\nis born--the exquisite and beautiful Rose. She is the Door or Gate of\r\nthe Transition or Passing Through from death to life: wherever man\r\nenters, _there_ is the Rose, and with her all the twin-symbols;--and\r\nwhen, bearing a rose, you chance to pass through some antique rock-gap,\r\nfar inland, near a running stream, start not, reader, should a strange\r\nthrill, as of a solemn vanished life, sweep over you; for so surely as\r\nyou live, know that in ancient days the footsteps of the rose-bearing\r\nworshipper went before you through that narrow pass, performing, by so\r\ndoing, the rite typical of new birth, revival, and the Covenant. She is\r\nthe cavern, the secret lair of life and the casket in which that one\r\ngreat arcanum and impenetrable secret of motherhood is forever\r\nconcealed--forever and forever. They found it hidden--those priests of\r\nold--in Woman and in the Rose, in fruits, and in all that lives or\r\ngrows; they traced the mystery up to godhood; they found it reflected in\r\nevery object of reception and transit--in the temple, and house, and\r\nvase, and moon-like horns; they saw it in the woodland path, winding\r\naway in darkness among the trees; it lurked in seeds and nuts: man could\r\ncrush the grape and burn the flower, but he could _not_ solve the\r\ninscrutable mystery of generation and life; and so he hallowed it. Hail\r\nto thee, thou, its fairest earthly form, O Rose of sunlight and luxury\r\nand love!\r\n\r\nIn a 'Floral Dictionary' at hand, I find the rose means, 'genteel,\r\npretty.' In another, twenty-four very different interpretations are\r\nascribed to as many varieties of this flower. It is almost needless to\r\nsay that the modern 'Language of Flowers' is, for the greater part,\r\nmerely the arbitrary invention of writers entirely ignorant of the\r\nsignification anciently attached to natural objects. The primary meaning\r\nof the rose is _love_; and it is a rose-garland, and not a tulip, which\r\nshould stand for a 'declaration of passion,' and, at the same time, for\r\na pledge of secrecy. Many of these modern fancies are, however, very\r\nbeautiful; as, for instance, in that German lyric in which the Angel of\r\nthe Flowers confers a fresh grace on the rose by veiling it in moss:\r\n\r\n  'And, robed in Nature's simplest weed,\r\n  Could there a flower that rose exceed?'\r\n\r\nBut our task is to investigate those antique meanings of flowers, that\r\nsecret language of life and love consecrated to them for thousands of\r\nyears, and now buried under forgotten lays, legends, and strange relics\r\nof art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACCARONI AND CANVAS.\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nROMAN FIRESIDES.\r\n\r\nIt was a warm day in October when Caper engaged rooms in the Babuino;\r\nthe sun shone cheerfully, and he took no heed of the cold weather to\r\ncome: in fact he entertained the popular idea that the land half-way\r\nbetween the tropics and paradise, called Italy, stood in no need of\r\npokers and coal hods: he was mistaken. Awaking one morning to the fact\r\nthat it was cold, he began an examination of his rooms for a fireplace:\r\nthere was none. He searched for a chimney--in vain. He went to see his\r\nlandlady about it: she was standing on a balcony, superintending the\r\nengineering of a bucket in its downward search for water. The house was\r\nfive stories high, and from each story what appeared to be a lightning\r\nrod ran down into what seemed to be a well, in a small garden. Up and\r\ndown these rods, tin buckets, fastened to ropes, were continually\r\nrunning, rattling, clanking down, or being drawn splashing, dripping up;\r\nand as they were worked assiduously, it made lively music for those\r\ndwelling in the back part of the house.\r\n\r\nHaving mentioned to the landlady that he wanted a fire, the good woman\r\nreflected a moment, and then directed the servant to haul out a sheet\r\niron vessel mounted on legs: this was next filled with charcoal, on\r\nwhich was thrown live coals, and the entire arrangement being placed\r\noutside the door on the balcony, the servant bent over and fanned it\r\nwith a turkey feather fan. Caper looked on in astonishment.\r\n\r\n'Are you going to embark in the roast chestnut trade?' he asked.\r\n\r\n'_Ma che!_' answered madame; 'that is your fire.'\r\n\r\n'It will bring on asphyxia.'\r\n\r\n'We are never asphyxied in Rome with it. You see, the girl fans all the\r\nvenom out of it; and when she takes it into your room it will be just as\r\nharmless as--let me see--as a baby without teeth.'\r\n\r\nThis comparison settled the question, for it proved it wouldn't bite.\r\nCaper managed to worry through the cold weather with this poor consoler:\r\nit gave him headaches, but it kept his head otherwise cool, and his feet\r\nwarm; and, as he lived mostly in his studio, where he had a good wood\r\nstove, he was no great loser.\r\n\r\n'But,' said he, descanting on this subject to Rocjean, 'how can the\r\nRomans fight for their firesides, when they haven't any?'\r\n\r\n'They will fight for their _scaldine_, especially the old women and the\r\nyoung women,' answered Rocjean, 'to the last gasp. There is nothing they\r\nstick to like these: even their husbands and lovers are not so near and\r\ndear to them.'\r\n\r\n'What are they? and, how much do they cost?' asked Caper, artistically.\r\n\r\n'Crockery baskets with handles; ten _baiocchi_,' replied Rocjean, 'You\r\nmust have noticed them; why, look out of that window: do you see that\r\ngirl in the house opposite. She has one on the window sill, under her\r\nnose, while her hands are both held over the charcoal fire that is\r\nburning in it. If there were any proof needed that the idea of a future\r\npunishment by fire did not originate in Rome, the best reply would be\r\nthe bitter hatred the Romans have of cold. I can fancy the income of the\r\nchurch twice as large if they had only thought to have filled purgatory\r\nwith icebergs and a corresponding state of the thermometer. A Roman, in\r\nwinter time, would pay twice as many _baiocchi_ for prayers to get a\r\ndeceased friend out of the cold, as he could otherwise be induced to.\r\nThe English and other foreigners have, little by little, induced hotel\r\nand boarding house keepers to introduce grates and stoves, with good\r\ncoal and wood fires, wherever they may hire lodgings; but the old Romans\r\nstill stand by braseras and scaldinas.'\r\n\r\n'I caught a bad cold yesterday, thanks to this barbarous custom,' said\r\nCaper. 'I was in the Vatican, looking at a pretty girl copying a head of\r\nRaphael's, and depending on imagination and charcoal to warm me: the\r\nresults were chills and the snuffles.'\r\n\r\n'Let that be a warning to you against entering art galleries during cold\r\nweather. To visit the Borghese collection with the thermometer below\r\nfreezing point, and see all those semi-nude paintings, whether of saints\r\nor sinners, chills the heart; not only that they have no clothes, but\r\nthat the artists who made the pictures were so radically vulgar--because\r\nthey were affected!'\r\n\r\n'But,' spoke Caper,'they probably painted them in the merry spring time,\r\nwhen they had forgotten all about frozen fountains and oranges iced; or,\r\nit may be, in their day wood was cheaper than it is now, and money\r\nplentier.'\r\n\r\n'Yes, in the days when three million pilgrims visited Rome in a year.\r\nBut would you believe it? within thirty miles of this city I have seen\r\nenough timber lying rotting on the ground, to half warm the Eternal\r\nCity? The country people, in the commune where I lived one summer, had\r\nthe privilege of gathering wood in the forest that crowns the range of\r\nmountains backing up from the sea, and separating the Pontine Marshes\r\nfrom the higher lands of the Campagna: but the trunks of the hewn trees,\r\nafter such light branches as the women could hack off were carried away,\r\nwere left to rot; for there was no way to get them to Rome--an hour's\r\ndistance by railroad. Cold? The Romans are numbed to the heart: wait\r\nuntil they are warmed up; wait until they have a chance to make\r\nmoney--there will be no poets like Casti in those days--Casti, who wrote\r\ntwo hundred sonnets against a man who dunned him for--thirty cents! Talk\r\nabout knowing enough to go into the house when it rains! Why the Roman\r\nshopkeepers of the poorer class don't know enough to shut their shop\r\ndoors when they are starved with cold: you will find this to be the\r\nfact. Look, too, at the poor little children! do they ever think of\r\nplaying fire engine, and thus warming themselves in a wholesome manner?\r\nNo! One day I was painting away, when I heard a poor, thin little voice,\r\nas of a small dinner bell with a croup, and hoping at last I might see\r\nthe little ones having a good frolic, I went to the window and looked\r\nout. What did I see? A small boy with a large, tallow-colored head,\r\ncarrying a large black cross in the pit of his stomach; another small\r\nboy ringing a bell; and five others following along, in a crushed,\r\ndespondent manner--inviting other boys to hear the catechism explained\r\nin the parish church. Meat for babes! I don't wonder the Roman women all\r\nwant to be men, when I see the men without half the spirit of the women,\r\nand, such as they are, loafing away the winter evenings for warmth in\r\nwine shops or cafes. Poor Roman women, huddled together in your dark\r\nrooms, feebly lighted with a poor lamp, and hugging _scaldine_ for\r\nbetter comfort! Would that the American woman could see her Italian\r\nsister, and bless her stars that she did not live under the cap and\r\ncross keys.'\r\n\r\n'The cold has one good effect,' interrupted Caper; 'the forcible\r\ngesticulation of the Italians, which we all admire so much, arises from\r\nthe necessity they have to do so--in order to keep warm. I have,\r\nhowever, an idea to better the condition of the wood sawyers in the\r\nPapal States, by introducing a saw buck or saw horse: as it is, they\r\nhold the wood in their hands, putting the saw between their knees, and\r\nthen fairly rubbing the wood through the saw, instead of the saw through\r\nthe wood. How, too, the Romans manage to cut wood with such axes as they\r\nhave is passing strange. It would be well to introduce an American axe\r\nhere, handle and all.'\r\n\r\n'We have an old, old saying in France,' spoke Rocjean:\r\n\r\n  '_Jamais cheval n'y homme\r\n  S'amenda pour aller a Rome._'\r\n\r\n'Never horse or man mended, that unto Rome wended.' Your American axe is\r\nuseless without American energy, and would not, if introduced here, mend\r\nthe present shiftless style of wood chopping: evidently the people will\r\none day take it up and try it--when their minds and arms are free. As it\r\nis, the genuine Romans live through their winters without wood in a\r\nmerry kind of humor; taking the charcoal sent them by chance for cooking\r\nwith great good nature; and, without words, blessing GOD for\r\ngiving them vigorous frames and sturdy bodies to withstand cold and\r\nheat. After all, the want of fixed firesides by no manner of means\r\nannoys the buxom Roman woman of the people: she picks up her moving\r\nstove, the _scaldina_, and trots out to see her nearest gossip, knowing\r\nthat her reception will be warm, for she brings warmth with her. There\r\nis a copy of Galignani, a round of bull beef, and a dirty coal fire,\r\neven in Rome, for every Englishman who will pay for them; but why, oh\r\nwhy! forever hoist the banner of the Blues over the gay gardens of every\r\nearthly paradise? Why hide Psyche under a hogshead?'\r\n\r\n'Are you asking me those hard questions? For if you are,' said Caper, 'I\r\nwill answer you thus: A fishwoman passing along a street in\r\nPhiladelphia one day, heard from an open window the silver-voiced\r\nBrignoli practising an aria, possibly from the Traviata: 'That voice,'\r\nquoth she, 'would be a fortune for a woman in shad time!''\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VIOLETS OF THE VILLA BORGHESE.\r\n\r\n  'It is well to be off with the old love\r\n  Before you are on with the new:'\r\n\r\nhummed James Caper, as he sauntered, one morning early, through the dewy\r\ngrass of the Villa Borghese, with his uncle, Bill Browne, leisurely\r\npicking a little bouquet of violets--'dim, but sweeter than the lids of\r\nJuno's eyes, or Cytherea's breath.'--and pleasantly thinking of the\r\npretty face of his last love, the blonde Rose, who was at that moment\r\nsmiling on somebody else in Naples.\r\n\r\n'There is nothing keeps a man out of mischief so well as the little\r\nportrait a pair of lovely eyes photographs on his heart; is there now,\r\nUncle Bill?'\r\n\r\n'No, Jim, you are 'bout right there: if you want to keep the devil out\r\nof your heart, you must keep an angel in it. If you can't find a\r\npermanent resident, why you must take up with transient customers. First\r\nand last, I've had the pictures of half the pretty girls in Saint Louis\r\nhanging up in my gallery: as one grows dim I take up another, and that's\r\nthe way I preserve my youth. If it hadn't been for business, I should\r\nhave been a married man long ago; and my advice to you, Jim, is to stop\r\noff being a bachelor the instant you are home again.'\r\n\r\n'I think I shall, the instant I find one with the beauty of an Italian,\r\nthe grace of a French girl, the truth and tenderness of a German, the\r\nhealth of an Englishwoman, and--'\r\n\r\n'Draw it mild, my boy,' broke in Uncle Bill: 'here she comes!'\r\n\r\nCaper and his uncle were standing, as the latter spoke, under the group\r\nof stone pines, from whose feet there was a lovely view of the Albanian\r\nsnow-capped mountains, and they saw coming toward them two ladies. There\r\nwas the freshness of the morning in their cheeks, and though one was\r\nolder than the other, joy-bringing years had passed so kindly with her,\r\nthat if Caper had not known she was the mother of the younger lady--they\r\nwould have passed for sisters. When he first saw them, the latter was\r\ngathering a few violets; when she rose, he saw the face of all others he\r\nmost longed to see.\r\n\r\nHe had first seen her the life of a gay party at Interlachen; then alone\r\nin Florence, with her mother for companion, patiently copying the Bella\r\ndi Tiziano in the Pitti palace; then in Venice, one sparkling morning,\r\nas he stepped from his gondola on the marble steps of a church, he met\r\nher again: this time he had rendered himself of assistance to the mother\r\nand daughter, in procuring admittance for them to the church, which was\r\nclosed to the public for repairs, and could only be seen by an especial\r\npermit, which Caper fortunately had obtained. They were grateful for his\r\nattention, and when, a few days afterward, he met them in company with\r\nother of his American friends, and received a formal introduction, the\r\nacquaintance proved one of the most delightful he had made in Europe,\r\nrendering his stay in Venice marked by the rose-colored light of a new\r\nlove, warming each scene that passed before his dreamy gaze. But other\r\ncities, other faces: memory slept to awake again with renewed strength\r\nat the first flash of light from the eyes of Ida Buren, there, over the\r\nspring violets of the Villa Borghese.\r\n\r\nThe meeting between Mrs. Buren, her daughter, and Caper, was marked, on\r\nthe part of the ladies, with that cordiality which the truly well bred\r\nshow instinctively to those who merit it--to those who, brave and loyal,\r\nprove, by word and look, that theirs is the right to stand within the\r\ncircle of true politeness and courtesy.\r\n\r\n'And so,' Mrs. Buren concluded her greeting, 'we are here in Rome,\r\npicking violets with the dew on them, and waiting for the nightingales\r\nto sing before we leave for Naples.'\r\n\r\n'And forget,' said Caper, among the violets of Pæstum, the poor flowers\r\nof the Borghese? I protest against it, and beg to add this little\r\nbouquet to yours, that their united perfume may cause you to remember\r\nthem.'\r\n\r\n'I accept them for you, mother,' spoke Ida; 'and that they may not be\r\nforgotten, I will make a sketch at once of that fountain under the ilex\r\ntrees, and Mr. Caper in classic costume, making floral offerings to\r\nBacchus--of violets.'\r\n\r\n'And why not to Flora?'\r\n\r\n'I have yet to learn that Flora has a shrine at--Monte Testaccio! where\r\nthe Signore Caper, if report speaks true, often goes and worships.'\r\n\r\n'That shrine is abandoned hereafter: where shall my new one be?'\r\n\r\n'In the Piazza di Spagna, No.----,' said Mrs. Buren, smiling at Caper's\r\nmournful tone of voice. 'While the violets bloom we shall be there. Good\r\nmorning!'\r\n\r\nThe ladies continued their walk, and although, as they turned away, Ida\r\ndropped a tiny bunch of violets, hidden among two leaves, Caper, when he\r\npicked it up, did not return it to her, but kept it many a day as a\r\nsouvenir of his fair countrywoman.\r\n\r\n'They are,' said Uncle Bill, slowly and solemnly, 'two of the finest\r\nspecimens of Englishwomen I ever saw, upon me word, be gad!'\r\n\r\n'They are,' said Caper, 'two of the handsomest Americans I ever met.'\r\n\r\n'Americans?' asked Uncle Bill, emphatically.\r\n\r\n'Americans!' answered Caper, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n'Shut up your paint shop, James, my son, call in the auctioneer, stick\r\nup a bill 'TO LET.' Let us return at once to the land of our\r\nbirth. No such attractions exist in this turkey-trodden,\r\nmaccaroni-eating, picture-peddling, stone-cutting, mass-singing land of\r\ndonkeys. Let us go. Americans!'\r\n\r\n'Yes, Americans--Bostonians,'\r\n\r\n'Farewell, seventy-five niggers--good-by, my speculations in Lewsianny\r\ncotton planting--depart from behind me, sugar crops on Bayou Fooshe! I\r\nam of those who want a Mrs. Browne, a duplicate of the elderly lady who\r\nhas just departed, at any price. James, my son, this morning shalt thou\r\nbreakfast with me at Nazzari's; and if thou hast not a bully old\r\nbreakfast, it's because the dimes ain't in me--and I know they are.\r\nNothing short of cream de Boozy frappayed, paddy frog grass pie, fill it\r\nof beef, and myonhays of pullits, with all kinds of saucy sons and so\r\nforth, will do for us. We have been among angels--shall we not eat like\r\nthe elect? Forward!'\r\n\r\nDuring breakfast, Caper discoursed at length with his uncle of the two\r\nladies they met in the villa.\r\n\r\nMrs. Buren, left a widow years since, with a large fortune, had educated\r\nher only child, Ida, systematically, solidly, and healthily. The child's\r\nmind, vine-like, clings for support to something already firm and\r\nestablished, that it may climb upward in a healthy, natural growth,\r\navoiding the earth; so the daughter had found in her mother a guide\r\ntoward the clear air where there is health and purity. Ida Buren, with\r\nclear brown eyes, high spirits, rosy cheeks, and full perfected form, at\r\none glance revealed the attributes that Uncle Bill had claimed for her\r\nso quickly. With all the beauty of an Italian, she had her perceptions\r\nof color and harmony in the violets she gathered; the truth and\r\ntenderness of a German, to appreciate their sentiment; the health of an\r\nEnglishwoman, to tramp through the dewy grass to pick them; the grace of\r\na Frenchwoman, to accept them from Nature with a _merci, madame_!\r\n\r\nCaper had now a lovely painting to hang up in his heart, one in unison\r\nwith the purity and beauty of the violets of the Villa Borghese.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CARNIVAL.\r\n\r\nThere is lightness and brightness, music, laughter, merry jests, masks,\r\nbouquets, flying flowers, and _confetti_ around you; you are in the\r\nCorso, no longer the sober street of a solemn old city, but the\r\nbrilliant scene of a pageant, rivalling your dreams of Fairy land,\r\nexcelling them; for it is fresh, sparkling, real before your eyes. From\r\nwindows and balconies wave in the wind all-colored tapestries, flutter\r\nred, white, and golden draperies; laugh out in festal garments gay\r\nrevellers; fly through the golden sunlight showers of perfumed flowers;\r\nbeam down on you glances from wild, loving eyes, sparkling with fun,\r\ngleaming with excitement, thrilling with witching life.\r\n\r\nHurrah for to-day! _Fiori, fiori, ecco fiori_! Baskets of flowers,\r\nbunches of flowers, bouquets of flowers, flowers natural and flowers\r\nartificial, flowers tied up and flowers loose. _Confetti, confetti, ecco\r\nconfetti_! Sugar plums white, sugar plums blue, bullets and buckshot of\r\nlime water and flour. Whiz! down comes the Carnival shower: '_Bella,\r\ndonzella_, this bouquet for thee!' Up go the white camellias and blue\r\nviolets: 'down comes a rosebud for me.' What wealth of loveliness and\r\nbeauty in thousands of balconies and windows; what sheen of brilliance\r\nin the vivid colors of the varied costumes!\r\n\r\nThe Carnival has come!\r\n\r\nRight and left fly flowers; and here and there dart in between wheels\r\nand under horses' legs, dirty, daring Roman boys, grasping the falling\r\nflowers or _confetti_. From a balcony, some wealthy _forestiero_ ('Ugh!\r\nhow rich they are!' grumbles the coachman) scatters _baiocchi_\r\nbroadcast, and down in the dirt and mud roll and tumble the little\r\nragamuffins, who never have muffins, and always have rags--and 'spang!'\r\ndown comes a double handful of hard _confetti_ on Caper's head, as he\r\nrides by in an open carriage. He bombards the window with a double\r\nhandful of white buckshot; but a woman in full Albano costume, crimson\r\nand white, aims directly at him a beautiful bouquet. Not to be outdone,\r\nCaper throws her a still larger one, which she catches and keeps--never\r\nthrowing him the one she aimed! He is sold! But 'whiz, whir!' right and\r\nleft fly flowers and _confetti_; and--oh, joy unspeakable!--an\r\nEnglishman's chimney-pot hat is knocked from his head by a strong\r\nbouquet; and we know\r\n\r\n  'There is a noun in Hebrew means 'I am,'\r\n  The English always use to govern d----n,'\r\n\r\nand that he is using it severely, and don't see the fun, you know--of\r\n_throwing things_! Who cares? _Avanti!_\r\n\r\nCaper had filled the carriage with loose flowers, small bouquets, a\r\nbasket of _confetti_, legal and illegal size, for the Carnival. Edict\r\nstrictly prohibited persons from throwing large-sized bouquets and\r\n_confetti_; consequently, everybody considered themselves compelled to\r\n_dis_obey the command. Rocjean, who was in the carriage with Caper,\r\ndelighted the Romans with his ingenuity in attaching bouquets to the end\r\nof a long fish pole, and thus gently engineering them to ladies in\r\nwindows or balconies. The crowd in the Corso grows larger and\r\nlarger--the scene in this long street resembles a theatre in open air,\r\nwith decorations and actors, assisted by a large supply of infantry and\r\ncavalry soldiers to keep order and attend to the scenes. The prosaic\r\nshops are no longer shops, but opera boxes, filled with actors and\r\nactresses instead of spectators, wearing all varieties of costume; the\r\nItalian ones predominant, gay, bright, and beautifully adapted to rich,\r\npeach-like complexions. Why call them olive complexions? For all the\r\nolives ever seen are of the color of a sick green pumpkin, or a too, too\r\nripe purple plum; and who has ever yet seen a beautiful Italian maiden\r\nof either of these morbid colors?\r\n\r\nThe windows and balconies of the Corso are opera boxes. 'Whiz!' The\r\nflying bouquets and white pills show plainly that the _prime donne_ are\r\nmaking their positively first appearances for the season. Look at that\r\nFrench soldier in company with another, who is passing under a balcony,\r\nwhen a tiny bunch of flowers falls, or is thrown at him: he stoops to\r\ngrasp it: too late, _mon brave_, a Roman boy is ahead of you: no use\r\nswearing; so he grasps his comrade by the arm, and points to the\r\nbalcony, which is not more than six feet above his head.\r\n\r\n'_Mon Dieu, qu'elle est gentille!_'\r\n\r\nAnd there stands the beauty, a thorough soldier's girl; weighs her\r\nhundred and seventy pounds, has cheeks like new-cut beefsteaks, hair\r\nblack as charcoal, eyes bright as fire, and an arm capable of cooking\r\nfor a regiment. She is dressed in full Albanian costume, has the dew of\r\nthe fields in her air, and oh, when she smiles, she shows such splendid\r\nteeth!--the _contadine_ have them, and don't ruin them by continual\r\neating! The soldier stops, 'Oh lord, she is neat!' He wants to return\r\nher flowery compliment with a similar one; but, _Tu bleu!_ one can't buy\r\nbouquets on four sous a day income--even in Rome: so he looks around for\r\na waif, and spies on the pavement something green; he gallantly throws\r\nit up, and with a smile and, wave of the hand like a Chevalier Bayard on\r\na bender, he bids adieu to the fair maiden. He threw up half a head of\r\nlettuce.\r\n\r\n'_Ach mein Gott! wollen sie nur?_' and in return for a double handful of\r\n_confetti_ flung into a carriage full of German artists ahead of him,\r\n'bang!' comes into Caper's vehicle a shower of lime pills and other\r\nstunners--not including the language--and he is in for it. A minute, and\r\nthe whole Corso rains, hails, and pelts flowers and white pills; nothing\r\nelse is visible: up there laugh down at them whole balconies, filled\r\nwith delirious men and women, throwing on their devoted heads, American,\r\nFrench, German, rattling, tumbling, fistfuls of _confetti_ and wild\r\nflowers:--even that half head of lettuce was among the things flying!\r\nEnglish, French, Dutch, Spanish, Germans, Italians, Americans, and those\r\nwild northern bloods--all grit and game--the Russians, are down on them\r\nlike a thousand of bricks. Hurrah! the carriages move on--they are safe.\r\nHurrah for a new fight with fresh faces! _Avanti!_\r\n\r\nComes a carriage load of wild Rustians. Ivan, the _mondjik_, fresh from\r\nthe Nevskoi Prospekt, now drives for the first time in the Corso--_Dam\r\nna vodka, Sabakoutchelovek_, thinks he. Yes, my sweet son of a dog, thou\r\nshalt have _vodka_ to drink after all this scrimmage is over. So he\r\nholds in his horses with one hand, crowds down his fur hat with the\r\nother, so that his eyes will be safe; and then bravely faces the\r\nstinging shower of _confetti_ his lord and master draws down on him. Up\r\non the back seat of this carriage, all life and fire, stands the Russian\r\nprince, with headpiece of mail and red surtout, a Carnival Circassian,\r\n'down on' the slow-plodding Italians, and throwing himself away with\r\nflowers and fun. Isn't he a picture? how his blue eyes gleam, how his\r\nlong, wavy moustache curls with the play of features! how the flowers\r\nfly--how the rubles fly for them! Look at the other Russians--there are\r\nbeards for you! beards grown where brandy freezes! but, they are thawed\r\nout now. Look at these men: hear their wild northern tongue, how it\r\nrolls out the sounds that frighten Italians back to sleepy sonnets and\r\nvoluptuous songs. Hurrah, my Russians! look fate in the face. _Your_\r\nroad is--onward!\r\n\r\n'Ah, yes; and really, my dear'--here a handful of white pills and lime\r\ndust breaks the sentence--'really my dear, hadn't we better'--'bang!'\r\ncomes a tough bouquet, and hits milady on that bonnet--'better go to the\r\nhotel?'\r\n\r\n'Indeed, now,' milady continues, 'they don't respect persons, these low\r\nItalians. They haven't the faintest idea of dignity.'\r\n\r\nThese 'low Italians' were more than probably fellow countrymen and women\r\nof the speaker; but they may have been 'low' all the same in her social\r\nbarometer, for they pitched and flung, hurled and threw all the missiles\r\nthey could lay hands on into the carriage of their unmistakable\r\ncompatriots, with hearty delight; since the gentleman, who was not\r\ngentle, sat upright as a church steeple, never moving a muscle, and\r\nlooking angry and worried at being flung at; and the milady also sat _a\r\nla mode de_ church steeple--throwing nothing but angry looks. They\r\n_went_ to the hotel. Sorrow go with them!\r\n\r\nCaper and Rocjean now began to throw desperately, for they had a large\r\nsupply of flowers and _confetti_ on hand, which they were anxious to\r\ndispose of suddenly--since in ten minutes the horses would run, and then\r\nthe carriages must leave the Corso. It was the last day of Carnival, and\r\nto-morrow--sackcloth and ashes. How the masks crowd around them; how the\r\nbeautiful faces, unmasked, are smiling! Look at them well, stamp them on\r\nyour heart, for many and many one shall we see never again. Another\r\nCarnival will bring them again, like song birds in summer; but a long,\r\nlong winter will be between, and we will be far, far away.\r\n\r\nThe Corso is cleared, the infantry half keeps the crowd within bounds, a\r\ncharge of cavalry sweeps the street, and then come rattling, clattering,\r\nrushing on the bare-backed horses, urged on by cries, shouts, yells; and\r\nfrightened thus to top speed, while the Dutch metal, tied to their sides\r\nincreases their alarm--whir! they are past us, and--the bay horse is\r\nahead.\r\n\r\nAgain the carriages are in the Corso; here and there a few bouquets are\r\nthrown, floral farewells to the merry season: then as dusk comes on, and\r\nred and golden behind San Angelo flames the funeral pyre of the sun, and\r\nthrough the blue night twinkles the evening star, see down the Corso a\r\nfaint light gleaming. Another and another light shines from balcony and\r\nwindow, flashes from rolling carriage, and flames out from along the\r\ndusky walls, till, _presto!_ you turn your head, and up the Corso, and\r\ndown the Corso, there is one burst of trembling light, and ten thousand\r\ntapers are brightly gleaming, madly waving, brilliantly swaying to and\r\nfro.\r\n\r\n_Moccoli! ecco, moccoli!_\r\n\r\nAlong roll carriages; high in air gleam tapers, upheld by those within;\r\nfrom every balcony and window shine out the swaying tapers. Hurrah!\r\nhere, there, hand to hand are contests to put out these shining lights,\r\nand SENZA MOCCOLI! 'Out with the tapers!' rings forth in\r\ntrumpet tones, in gay, laughing tones, in merry tones, the length of the\r\nwhole glorious Corso.\r\n\r\nDaring beauty, wild, lovely bacchante, with black, beaming eyes, tempt\r\nus not with that bright flame to destruction! Look at her, as she stands\r\nso proudly and erectly on the highest seat in the carriage, her arms\r\nthrown up, her wild eyes gleaming from under jet black, dishevelled\r\nlocks, while the night breeze flutters in wavy folds the drapery of her\r\nclassic dress. _Senza moccoli!_ she sends the challenge ringing down\r\nthrough fifteen centuries. He braves all; the carriage is climbed, the\r\ntaper is within his reach.\r\n\r\n'To-morrow I leave!'\r\n\r\nShe flings the burning taper away from her.\r\n\r\n'Then take this kiss!'\r\n\r\n'SENZA MOCCOLI!' black, witching eyes--farewell!\r\n\r\n'Boom!' rings out the closing bell; fast fades the light, 'Out with the\r\ntapers!' the shout swells up, up, up, then slowly dies, as die an\r\norgan's tones--and Carnival is ended.\r\n\r\nA handful of beautiful flowers, found among gray, crumbling ruins; a few\r\nnotes of wild, stirring music, suddenly heard, then quickly dying away\r\nin the lone watches of the night: these are the hours of the Roman\r\nCarnival.\r\n\r\n  'Played is the comedy, deserted now the scene.'\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VERMILION MIRACLE.\r\n\r\nMiracles are no longer performed in Rome. As soon as the police are\r\nofficially informed, they prevent their being worked even in the\r\nCampagna:--official information, however, always travels much faster\r\nwhen the spurs of heretical incredulity are applied--otherwise it lags;\r\nand the performances of miracle-mongers insure crowded houses, sometimes\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\nAmong Caper's artist friends was a certain Blaise Monet, French by\r\nnature, Parisian by birth, artist or writer according to circumstances.\r\nCircumstances--that is to say, two thousand francs left him by a\r\ndeceased relation--created him a temporary artist in Rome.\r\n\r\n'When the money is gone,' said he, 'I shall endow some barber\r\nwith my goat's hair brushes, and resume the stylus: the first\r\nhave attractions--capillary--for me; the latter has the\r\nattraction--gravitation of francs--still more interesting--that is to\r\nsay, more stylish.'\r\n\r\nBlaise Monet with the May breezes fled to a small town on top of a high\r\nmountain, in order to enjoy them until autumn: with the rains of October\r\nhe descended on Rome.\r\n\r\n'How did you enjoy yourself up in that hawk's nest?' Caper asked him,\r\nwhen he first saw him after his return to the city.\r\n\r\n'Like the king D'Yvétot. My house was a castle, my drink good wine, my\r\nfood solid--the cheese a little too much so, and a little too much of\r\nit: no matter--the views made up for it. Gr-r-rand, magnificent,\r\nsplendid--in fact, paradise for twenty baiocchi a day, all told.'\r\n\r\n'And as for affairs of the heart?'\r\n\r\n'My friend, mourn with me: that hole was--so to speak in regard to that\r\nmatter--a monastery, without doors, windows, or holes; and a wall around\r\nit, so high, it shut out--hope! I wish you could have seen the camel who\r\nwas my monastic jailer.'\r\n\r\n'That is, when you say camel, you mean jackass?'\r\n\r\n'Precisely! Well, my friend, his name was Father Cipriano; though why\r\nthey call a man father who has no legal children, I can't conceive,\r\nthough probably many of his flock do. He prejudiced the minds of the\r\nmaidens against me, and made an attempt to injure my reputation among\r\nthe young men and elders--in vain. The man who could paint a scorpion on\r\nthe wall so naturally as even to delude Father Ciprian into beating it\r\nfor ten minutes with that bundle of sticks they call a broom; the man\r\nwho could win three races on a bare-backed horse, treat all hands to\r\nwine, and even bestow segars on a few of the elders; win a _terno_ at\r\nthe Timbola, and give it back to the poor of the town; catch hold of the\r\nrope and help pull by the horns, all over town, the ox, thus\r\npreparatorily made tender before it was slaughtered: such a man could\r\nnot have the ill will of the men.\r\n\r\n'Believe me, I did all my possible to touch the hearts of the maidens. I\r\nserenaded them, learning fearful _rondinelle_, so as to be popular; I\r\ngathered flowers for them; I volunteered to help them pick chestnuts and\r\ncut firewood; I helped to make fireworks and fire balloons for the\r\nfestivals; I drew their portraits in charcoal on a white wall, along the\r\nmain street; and when they passed, with copper water jars on their\r\nheads, filled with water from the fountain, they exclaimed:\r\n\r\n''_Ecco!_ that is Elisa, that is Maricuccia, that is Francesca.'\r\n\r\n'But I threw my little favors away: there was a black cloud over all, in\r\na long black robe, called Padre Cipriano; and their hearts were\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\n'I made one good friend, a widow lady, the Signora Margarita Baccio: she\r\nwas about thirty-three years of age, and was mourning for a second\r\nhusband--who did not come; the first one having departed for _Cielo_ a\r\nfew months past, as she told me. The widow having a small farm to hoe\r\nand dig, and about twelve miles to walk daily, I had but limited\r\nopportunities to study her character; but I believe, if I had, I should\r\nnot have discovered much, since she had very little: she was deplorably\r\nignorant, and excessively superstitious--but good natured and\r\nhopeful--looking out for husband No. 2. She it was that informed me that\r\nPadre Cipriano had set the faces of the maidens against me, and for this\r\nI determined to be revenged.\r\n\r\n'A short time before I left the town, my oil colors were about used up.\r\nI had made nearly a hundred sketches, and not caring to send to Rome for\r\nmore paints, I used my time making pencil sketches. Among the tubes of\r\noil colors left, of course there was the vermilion, that will outlast\r\nfor a landscape painter all others, I managed to paint a jackass's head\r\nfor the landlord of the inn where I boarded, with my refuse\r\ncolors:--after all were gone, there still remained the vermilion. One\r\nday, out in the fields sketching an old tower, and watching the pretty\r\nlittle lizards darting in and out the old ruins, an idea struck me. The\r\nnext day I commenced my plan.\r\n\r\n'I caught about fifty lizards, and painted a small vermilion cross on\r\nthe head of each one, using severe drying oil and turpentine, in order\r\nto insure their not being rubbed off.\r\n\r\n'The next dark night, when Padre Cipriano was returning from an\r\nexcursion, he saw an apparition: phosphorus eyes, from the apothecary; a\r\npair of horns, from the butcher; a tall form, made from reeds, held up\r\nby Blaise Monet, and covered with his long cloak, made in the Rue\r\nCadet--strode before him with these words:\r\n\r\n''I am the shade of Saint Inanimus, boiled to death by Roman legions,\r\nfor the sake of my religion--in oil. My bones long since have mouldered\r\nin the dust, but, where they lie, the little lizards bear a red cross on\r\ntheir heads. Seek near the old tower by the old Roman road, here at the\r\nfoot of this mountain, and over it erect a chapel, and cause prayers to\r\nbe said for Saint Inanimus: I, who was boiled to death for the sake of\r\nmy religion--in oil.'\r\n\r\n''Sh-sh-shade of S-s-saint Ann-on-a-muss, w-w-what k-kind of oi-oil was\r\nit?' gasped Padre Cipriano.\r\n\r\n'The shade seemed to collect himself as if about to bestow a kick on the\r\npadre, but changed his mind as he screamed:\r\n\r\n''Hog oil. Go!'\r\n\r\n'The priest departed in fear and trembling, and the next day the whole\r\ntown rang with the news that an apparition had visited Padre Cipriano,\r\nand that a procession for some reason was to be made at once to the old\r\ntower. Accordingly all the population that could, set forth at an early\r\nhour in the afternoon, the padre first informing them of all the\r\ncircumstances attending the ghostly visitor, the red-headed cross\r\nlizards by no means omitted. Arrived at the tower, they were fortunate\r\nenough to find a red-cross lizard, then another, and another; and it\r\nbeing buzzed about that one of them was worth, I don't know how many\r\ngallons of holy water--the inhabitants moreover believing, if they had\r\none, they could commit all kinds of sins free gratis, without\r\nconfession, &c.,--there at once commenced, consequently, a most\r\nindecorous riot among those in the procession; taking advantage of\r\nwhich, the lizards made hurried journeys to other old ruins. The\r\ninhabitants of another small town, having heard of the _Miracolo delle\r\nlucertole_, came up in force to secure a few lizards for their\r\nhouseholds: then commenced those exquisite battles seen nowhere else in\r\nsuch perfection as in southern Italy.\r\n\r\n'His eyes starting out of his head, his hands and legs shaking with\r\nexcitement, one man stands in front of another so 'hopping mad' that you\r\nwould believe them both dancing the tarantella, if you did not hear them\r\nshout--such voices for an opera chorus!--\r\n\r\n''You say that to _me_? to ME? to ME!' Hands working.\r\n\r\n''I do, to _you!_'\r\n\r\n''To me, _me_, ME?' striking himself on his breast.\r\n\r\n''Yes, yes, I do, I do!'\r\n\r\n''What, to ME! ME! _I_?' both hands pointing toward\r\nhis own body, as if to be sure of the identity of the person; and that\r\nthere might not be the possibility of any mistake, he again shouts,\r\nscreams, yells, shrieks: 'To me? What, that to ME! to ME!'\r\nhands and arms working like a crab's.\r\n\r\n'Then the entire population rush, in with, 'Bravo, Johnny, bravo!' At\r\nlast, after they have screamed themselves black in the face, and swung\r\ntheir arms and legs until they are ready to drop off, both combatants\r\ncoolly walk off; and a couple of fresh hands rush in, assisted by the\r\nsplendid Roman chorus, and begin:\r\n\r\n''What, ME? ME?' &c.\r\n\r\n'But the battle of the lizards was conducted with more spirit than the\r\ngeneral run of quarrels, for the people were fighting for remission of\r\ntheir sins as it were--the possession of every sanctified red-headed\r\nlizard being so much money saved from the church, so many years out of\r\npurgatory.\r\n\r\n'The _gendarmerie_ heard the row, and at once rushed down--four soldiers\r\ncomprised the garrison--to dissipate the crowd: this they managed to do\r\nin a peaceable way. There happened to be a heretical spur in the town,\r\nin the shape of three German artists, and this incited the bishop of the\r\nprovince, who was at once informed of the miracle-working doings of\r\nFather Ciprian, to displace him.\r\n\r\n'Thus, my dear friend, I was left to make love to the girls until I had\r\nto return to Rome--unfortunately only two weeks' time--for the\r\nnewly-appointed priest had not the opportunity to set them against me.\r\n\r\n'The moral of this long story is: that even vermilion can be worked up\r\nin a miraculous manner--if you put the powerful reflective faculty in\r\nmotion; and doing so, you can have the satisfaction of knowing that by\r\nits means you can cause an invisible sign to be stuck up over even a\r\ncountry town in Italy: '_All Persons are Forbidden to Work Miracles\r\nHere!_''\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POPOLO EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\nThe government, aware of its foreign reputation for patronizing the\r\n_Belle Arti_, has an annual display of such paintings and sculpture as\r\nartists may see fit to send, and--the censor see fit to admit: for, in\r\n_this_ exhibition, 'nothing is shown that will shock the most fastidious\r\ntaste'--and it can be found thus, in a building in the Piazza del\r\nPopolo.\r\n\r\nCaper's painting for the display was rejected for some reason. It\r\nrepresented a sinister-looking brigand, stealing away with Two Keys in\r\none hand and a spilt cap in the other, suddenly kicked over by a\r\nlarge-sized donkey, his mane and tail flying, head up, and an air of\r\nliberty about him generally, which probably shocked Antonelli's tool the\r\ncensor's sense of the proprieties.\r\n\r\nRocjean consoled Caper with the reflection that his painting was refused\r\nadmittance because the donkey had gradually grown to be emblematical of\r\nthe state--in fact, was so popularly known to the _forestieri_ as the\r\nRoman Locomotive, with allusions to its steam whistle, &c., highly\r\nannoying to the chief authorities--and therefore, its introduction in a\r\npainting was intolerable, and not to be endured.\r\n\r\nThe works of art included contributions from Americans, Italians,\r\nBelgians, Swiss, English, Hessians, French, Dutch, Danes, Bavarians,\r\nSpaniards, Norwegians, Prussians, Russians, Austrians, Finns,\r\nEsthonians, Lithuanians, Laplanders, and Samoyedes. There was little\r\nevidence of the handiwork of mature artists; they either withheld their\r\nproductions from dislike of the managers, or through determination of\r\ngiving their younger brethren a fair field and a clear show. A careful\r\nobserver could see that these young artists had not profited to the\r\nfullest extent by the advantages held out to them through a residence in\r\nthe Imperial City. There was a wine-yness, and a pretty-girl-yness, and\r\ntobacco-ness, about paintings and sculpture, that could have been picked\r\nup just as well in Copenhagen or Madrid or New York as in Rome. Michael\r\nAngelo evidently had not 'struck in' on their canvases, or Praxiteles\r\nstruck out from their marbles. Theirs was an unrevealed religion to\r\nthese neophytes.\r\n\r\nThe study of a piece of old Turkey carpet, or a camel's hair shawl, or a\r\nbutterfly's wing, or a bouquet of many flowers would have taught the\r\nbest artist in the exhibition more concerning color than he would learn\r\nin ten years simply copying the best of the old painters, who had\r\nthemselves studied directly from these things and their like.\r\n\r\nIn sculpture, as in painting, the artists showed the same tame following\r\nother sculptors; the same fear of facing Nature, and studying her face\r\nto face. A pretty kind of statue of Modesty a man would make, who would\r\ntake the legs of a satyr, the body of a Venus, the head of Bacchus, the\r\narms of Eros, and thus construct her; yet scarcely a modern statue is\r\nmade wherein some such incongruous models do not play their part. Go\r\nwith a clear head, not one ringing with last night's debauch, and study\r\nthe Dying Gladiator! That will be enough--something more than five\r\ntenths of you young Popolites can stand, if you catch but the faintest\r\nconception of the mind once moving the sculptor of such a statue. After\r\nyou have earnestly thought over such a masterpiece, go back to your\r\nstudio: break up your models for legs, arms, bodies, and heads: take the\r\nscalpel in hand, and study _anatomy_ as if your heart was in it. Have\r\nthe living model nude before you at all times. Close your studio door to\r\nall 'orders,' be they ever so tempting: if a fastidious world will have\r\nyou make 'nude statues dressed in stockinet,' tell it to get behind you!\r\nAfter long years of earnest study and labor, carve a hand, a foot: if,\r\nwhen you have finished it, one living soul says, with truth, 'Blood,\r\nbones, and muscles seem under the marble!' believe that you are not far\r\noff from exceeding great reward.\r\n\r\nIn the Popolo exhibition for 1858 was a marble statuette of Daphnis and\r\nChloe, by Luigi Guglielmi, of Rome.\r\n\r\nChloe had a low-necked dress on.\r\n\r\nThe Roman censor disapproved of this. In a city claiming to be the 'HOME\r\nOF ART'--THEY PINNED A PIECE OF FOOLSCAP PAPER AROUND THE NECK OF\r\nCHLOE.\r\n\r\nRome is the cradle of art:--if so, the sooner the world changes its\r\nnurse, the better for the babe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'MISSED FIRE!'\r\n\r\n  Oh not in Independence Hall\r\n    Will ye proclaim your will;\r\n  Nor read aloud your negro call,\r\n    As yet, on Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\n  He said he would, and thought he could,\r\n    And tried--and missed it clean;--\r\n  Now he's o'er the Border, and awa',\r\n    Weel thrashed and unco' mean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCLAMATION.\r\n\r\n[SEPTEMBER 22, 1862.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Now who has done the greatest deed\r\n    Which History has ever known,\r\n  And who, in Freedom's direst need,\r\n    Became her bravest champion?\r\n  Who a whole continent set free?\r\n    Who killed the curse and broke the ban\r\n  Which made a lie of liberty?\r\n    You--Father ABRAHAM--you're the man!\r\n\r\n  The deed is done. Millions have yearned\r\n    To see the spear of Freedom cast:--\r\n  The dragon writhed and roared and burned:\r\n    You've smote him full and square at last.\r\n  O Great and True! You do not know,\r\n    You cannot tell, you cannot feel\r\n  How far through time your name must go,\r\n  Honored by all men, high or low,\r\n    Wherever Freedom's votaries kneel.\r\n\r\n  This wide world talks in many a tongue--\r\n    This world boasts many a noble state--\r\n  In _all_, your praises will be sung,\r\n    In all the great will call you great.\r\n  Freedom! Where'er that word is known,\r\n    On silent shore, by sounding sea,\r\n  'Mid millions or in deserts lone,\r\n    Your noble name shall ever be.\r\n\r\n  The word is out--the deed is done;\r\n    Let no one carp or dread delay:\r\n  When such a steed is fairly on,\r\n    Fate never fails to find a way.\r\n  Hurrah! hurrah! The track is clear,\r\n    We know your policy and plan;\r\n  We'll stand by you through every year:\r\n    Now, Father ABRAHAM, _you're_ our man!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESS IN THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe unexampled extent of newspaper issues in the United States has often\r\nexcited the astonishment of intelligent observers; but it is doubtful\r\nwhether the whole of the enormous truth could have been fully\r\nappreciated without the actual figures which reveal it. According to the\r\n\"preliminary report\" of the 8th census, 1860, recently published by the\r\nHon. J.C.G. Kennedy, the superintendent, it appears that the annual\r\ncirculation of newspapers and periodicals is no less than 927,951,548,\r\nor at the rate of 34.36 for every white man, woman, and child of our\r\npopulation. The annual value of all the printing done in the United\r\nStates, for that year, is stated at a fraction less than thirty nine and\r\nthree quarters millions of dollars.\r\n\r\nThese numbers are sufficiently astounding; but the rate of increase\r\nsince 1850, is, if possible, even more so. In that year, says Mr.\r\nKennedy, the whole circulation amounted to 426,409,978 copies; and the\r\nrate of increase for the decade is 117.61 per cent., while the increase\r\nof the white population during the same period was only 38.12 per cent.\r\nIf the circulation should continue to grow in the same proportion for\r\nthe next ten years, the number of newspapers and periodicals issued in\r\n1870 will be a little over two billions.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these domestic publications, no inconsiderable number of\r\nforeign journals is introduced into the United States. \"The British\r\nAlmanac and Companion\" for 1862 states the number in 1860 to have been\r\nas follows: from Great Britain, 1,557,689; from France, 270,655; from\r\nBremen, 41,171; from Prussia, 83,349. These figures comprehend only the\r\nforeign newspapers, and not the periodicals, some of which are\r\nrepublished in the United States.\r\n\r\nPersons competent to form a correct judgment, do not hesitate to say\r\nthat the number of newspapers taken in this country, exceeds that in all\r\nthe world beside. So vast an amount of reading matter, voluntarily\r\nsought for and consumed by the people, at a cost of so many millions of\r\ndollars, is one of the most remarkable phenomena of the present age of\r\nwonders, and proves the avidity with which information is received, as\r\nwell as the incalculable influence which the press must have on the\r\npublic mind. The popular newspaper, issued in immense numbers, is in\r\ntruth emphatically an American institution. Nowhere else could an\r\naudience, capable of reading, be found sufficiently numerous to absorb\r\nthe issues of our teeming press. It is the offspring and indispensable\r\naccompaniment of universal education and popular representative\r\ngovernment. These could scarcely be maintained without it. Everywhere in\r\nEurope, except perhaps in England, Italy, and Switzerland, the press is\r\nlittle more than an engine of the government, used chiefly, or only, for\r\nits own political purposes. Here it enjoys absolute freedom, being\r\nresponsible only to the laws for any abuse of its high privilege.\r\n\r\nThis entire freedom promotes unbounded growth in journalism, and gives a\r\ncirculation to the remotest cabin in the land. And if the unrestricted\r\nenergies of the system produce fruits somewhat wild, not imbued with the\r\nrefined flavor of better-cultivated productions, their universal\r\ndistribution and bounteous fulness of supply make up somewhat for the\r\ndeficiency in quality, and give promise of a future improvement, which\r\nwill leave nothing to be desired. If every leaf of the forest were a\r\nsibylline record, and every month of the year should bring round the\r\ndeciduous influences of autumn, the leaves that would then \"strew the\r\nvales\" of our country would give some adequate idea of the immense\r\nshower of these printed missiles which falls every day, every week, and\r\nevery month, into the hands of the American people. Do they come as \"a\r\nkindly largess to the soil they grew on,\" or do they scatter mischief\r\nwhere they fall? Of the power, for good or for evil, of this vast\r\nintellectual agency, there can be no question. But what is the nature of\r\nthis influence? How does it affect the character and welfare of the\r\ncommunity in which its unregulated and unlimited authority prevails?\r\n\r\nThe daily papers of New York, and of some other cities, contain, in each\r\nsheet, an amount of printed matter equal to sixty-four pages of an\r\nordinary octavo volume. The scope and variety of the information\r\nembodied in them, and the uniformity with which they are maintained from\r\nyear to year, give evidence of wonderful enterprise, mechanical skill,\r\nand intellectual ability. Concentrating news from all parts of the\r\nworld, by means of a vast and expensive organization, and discussing,\r\nwith more or less profound learning and logic, all the important\r\nquestions of the day, they have established an immense spiritual power\r\nin the bosom of modern society, such as was not known to the nations in\r\npast ages.\r\n\r\nIt is true that much of the space in the great dailies, so voluminous as\r\nhas been stated, is occupied in mere business notices and individual\r\nadvertisements; and such is the case, generally, with the daily and\r\nweekly papers throughout the country. But even this, the humblest\r\ndepartment of the newspaper, may justly be considered an invaluable\r\ninstrument of civilization. It multiplies to an unlimited extent the\r\nmeans of communication among men, and is, therefore, a labor-saving\r\ninvention of precisely the same character as the railroad and the steam\r\nengine. In a few brief phrases, made expressive by conventional\r\nunderstanding, every man can converse with thousands of his neighbors,\r\nand even of distant strangers. Without change of place, without labor of\r\nlimbs or of lungs, the man of business can, in a single day, and every\r\nday, if he will, inform a whole community of his own wants, and of his\r\nreadiness to meet the wants of others. The newspaper performs the work\r\nof thousands of messengers, and saves countless hours of labor to the\r\nwhole community in which it circulates. In some sense, every man is\r\nbrought nearer to every other. Each hears the innumerable voices which\r\naddress him, and is able to distinguish the individual message which\r\neach one has sent.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to estimate the value of this simple agency in its\r\nsocial aspect. Its material saving is plain to the most cursory thought;\r\nbut its higher influence in binding society together and making it\r\nhomogeneous, if not equally apparent, is at least quite as indisputable.\r\nCivilization is the direct result of bringing mankind into cooperation\r\nand combined effort, so that the whole power of mind and body of whole\r\ncommunities is brought to bear in unison for the accomplishment of\r\nsocial ends. Therefore, as a mere instrument of intercommunication,\r\nrendering more direct and intimate the relations of individuals, and\r\npromoting ease, celerity, and harmony in their combined movements, the\r\npower of the press is prodigious and invaluable. But when this power is\r\nextended beyond the bounds of mere material interests and the relations\r\nof ordinary business--when it appeals to the intellect and enters the\r\ndomain of art, literature, science, and philosophy, embracing politics,\r\nmorality, and all the highest interests of mankind, its capacity for\r\ngood would seem to be illimitable.\r\n\r\nIn future ages, these innumerable sheets, which float so lightly on the\r\nsurface of our civilization, will form imperishable records of the\r\nmanners, habits, occupations, and the whole intellectual existence of\r\nour people. They are so numerous that no accident can destroy them all;\r\nand they will present to the eye of the future student of history the\r\nmost lively, natural, and perfect picture--the very moving panorama--of\r\nthe busy and teeming life of the present generation. No exhumed relics\r\nof buried cities, no hieroglyphic inscriptions upon ancient monuments,\r\nwith whatever skill and genius deciphered, nor even any labored\r\ndescriptions of past ages, which may have survived the ravages of time,\r\nwill be equal to these memorials, in their power to recall the daily\r\nwork, the amusements, the business, and, in short, the whole material,\r\nintellectual, and social being of our people.\r\n\r\nThe types and footprints of creation, imprinted on the rocks and\r\nimbedded in the strata of the earth, giving knowledge of the existence\r\nand habits of extinct species of animals, and teaching how geological\r\nperiods have succeeded each other, with their causes and concomitants,\r\nare not so plain and distinct to us, as will be these daily effusions,\r\nadvertisements, and business notices of all kinds in the ordinary\r\nnewspapers of the country, to future generations of men, who shall there\r\nseek to learn the successive and gradual steps by which the social\r\nfabric shall be built up on the foundations of human thought and action.\r\nLike the worm that crawls over the mud ere it hardens into rock; or the\r\nleaf that fixes its form and impress in the bed of coal; or like the\r\nbowlder that forms the pencil point of a mighty iceberg, scratching the\r\nrocks in its movement across a submerged plain, destined to be upheaved\r\nas a continent in some future convulsion; or like the coral insect,\r\nwhich, in forming his separate cell, unconsciously assists in laying the\r\nfoundation of islands and vast regions of solid earth; we, the creatures\r\nof the hour, all unconscious of the record we are making, leave\r\nimperishable memorials of our existence and works, in the apparently\r\npetty and fugitive contents of the journals which we read daily, and in\r\nwhich we make known our business and our wants. Narratives and formal\r\ndescriptions may be one-sided, and may easily deceive and mislead; but\r\nthese indications, which will be preserved in the social strata as they\r\nslowly subside in the ocean of humanity, carry in themselves perfect\r\nfulness and absolute verity.\r\n\r\nOne of the most significant and influential results of the wide and\r\nrapid circulation of newspapers is to be found in the simultaneous\r\nimpression made on the popular mind throughout the vast extent of our\r\ncountry. Flashed on the telegraph, daguerreotyped and made visible in\r\nthe newspaper, every event of any importance, occurring in any part of\r\nthe world, is communicated, almost at the same moment, to many millions\r\nof people. All are impressed at the same time with the same thoughts, or\r\nwith such kindred ideas as will naturally arise from reflection upon the\r\nsame facts. Humor, with its thousand tongues, is hushed; and the\r\ntelegraph, under control of agents employed to sift the truth, and\r\nresponsible for it, takes its place. Falsehood still may, and, indeed,\r\noften does tamper with this mighty instrument; but its speed is so great\r\nthat it can overtake even falsehood, and soon counteract and correct the\r\nmischief. What is the import of this momentous fact,--the instantaneous\r\ncommunication of information over a continent, and the participation of\r\nall minds, in the same thoughts, virtually at the same time? Undoubtedly\r\nthe result must be a closeness of intercourse and a completeness of\r\ncooperation, which will give to the social organization a power and\r\nefficiency in accomplishing great ends, such as no human thought has\r\never heretofore conceived. Society becomes a unity in the highest and\r\ntruest sense of that term; like the bodily frame of the individual man,\r\nit is connected throughout all its parts by a network of nerves, every\r\nmember sympathizing with every other, feeling the same impulses, having\r\nthe same knowledge, and forming judgments upon the same facts. When\r\nsentiments are perfectly harmonious among men, the increase of power is\r\nnot merely in proportion to numbers. It grows in a much higher ratio.\r\nThe effect is something like that of multiplying the surfaces in a\r\ngalvanic battery, or increasing the coils in an electro-magnetic\r\napparatus. Passion in a multitude becomes a tornado. Eloquence moves a\r\nlarge audience with a power vastly greater than when the listeners are\r\nfew. Similar is that strange influence which fashion exerts in all\r\nsocieties. Nor is this sympathetic multiplication of power limited to\r\npassion or artistic sentiment: it extends to opinions and all\r\nintellectual phenomena. A person feeling strong emotions or having\r\nprofound convictions, and knowing them to be shared by millions of\r\nothers, inevitably experiences a strengthening and intensifying\r\ninfluence from the sympathy of his fellows. If he knew himself to be\r\nsolitary and alone in his opinions, unsupported by that human sympathy\r\nwhich every one craves, his ideas would languish, and be greatly\r\ndiminished in their power. It is only great minds, of exceptional\r\ncharacter, which can do battle, single-handed, against the world. Most\r\nmen require to be propped and supported on all sides, by the great power\r\nof public opinion. The approach to unanimity of thought promoted by the\r\ngeneral circulation of newspapers, has something of the marvellous\r\neffects seen in other cases, in enhancing the moral and intellectual\r\npower of the community.\r\n\r\nThe telegraph is the legitimate offspring of the newspaper. In the\r\nabsence of the latter, there would have been comparatively little use\r\nfor the former. Without the almost universal distribution of the\r\nnewspaper, instantaneous communication of news would not have been so\r\nmuch required, and the invention for that purpose would hardly have been\r\nmade. It is probably in the United States alone, with its unlimited\r\ncirculation of newspapers, that this extraordinary application of\r\nnatural forces could have been conceived. It is here those wonderful\r\nlightning presses have been constructed, under the stimulus of that vast\r\ndemand for daily papers which arises from the general education of the\r\npeople and their avidity for information. In no other state of things\r\ncould such combinations have been imagined, because there would have\r\nbeen no occasion for the inventive effort, and even the very idea would\r\nnot have occurred. Although the wide extent of our country, the vast\r\ndistances separating important centres of commerce and industry, and the\r\ngeneral activity and energy of men in this free government, all\r\nconcurred in enforcing the necessity of this latest wonder of human\r\ningenuity--the telegraph,--yet the newspaper, with its boundless\r\ncirculation and power of distribution, was indispensable to make it\r\navailable and to give it all its inestimable value.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, the prodigious influence of the press, aided by its\r\ngreat instrument, the telegraph, derives its moral and political value\r\nchiefly from the lessons it teaches, and the good purposes it aims to\r\naccomplish. Unhappily, if the newspaper may be the means of doing\r\nincalculable good, it may also be instrumental in doing infinite\r\nmischief. If it may multiply the power of the community, by promoting\r\nharmony of thought and feeling, it may direct this concentrated energy\r\nto the wrong end, as well as to the right. Being a great vehicle for the\r\ncommunication of ideas on all subjects, it becomes a mighty instrument\r\nof education; entering almost every house in the land, and reaching the\r\neye of every man, woman, and child who can read, it exercises almost\r\nsupreme control over the sentiments of the masses. It is a tremendous\r\nintellectual engine, radiating the light of knowledge to the extremities\r\nof the land, and, in its turn, wielding, to some extent, the\r\nincalculable power which that knowledge imparts to its recipients.\r\n\r\nLike every other human agency, the press is liable to be controlled by\r\nsinister influences. Perhaps, from the entire absence of all direct\r\nresponsibility, from its usual entire devotion to public affairs, and\r\nthe acknowledged influence of its representations on the popular mind,\r\nit is peculiarly exposed to the seductions of patronage, and to the\r\ntemptations of personal and mercenary interests. A mere party journal,\r\ninvolved in a perpetual conflict for power, and for the accompanying\r\nspoils, is, of all the depositaries of moral power, at once the most\r\ndangerous and the most contemptible. To it, truth is of secondary\r\nimportance; having satisfied itself that no prosperity, or even liberty,\r\ncan exist without the success of its men and measures, it makes\r\neverything bend to this purpose. The end justifies the means. Impartial\r\nstatement or rational investigation is seldom to be found in its\r\ncolumns. Nevertheless, in the general competition which arises where the\r\npress is free, the _tendency_ will always be toward the true and the\r\ngood. Rival journals will advocate different theories and maintain\r\nopposite systems; but free discussion will gradually eliminate error,\r\nand out of the multitudinous rays of different colors, diffused\r\nthroughout society, will eventually come that perfect combination which\r\nconstitutes the clear, pure, homogeneous light of truth. And even\r\npending the early struggle and confusion which attend the inauguration\r\nof a free press, divergencies of opinion, ever tending to harmony,\r\ncannot become so great as to produce fatal effects. The rebellion of the\r\nSouthern States of this Union could never have happened, in the presence\r\nof universal education and of a free press, whose emanations could have\r\npenetrated as widely as those which reach the people of the opposite\r\nsection.\r\n\r\nIn view of the high functions of the press and its immense influence in\r\nthe nation,--its perpetual daily lessons, falling on the public mind\r\nlike drops that wear away the hardest rock and work their channel where\r\nthey will,--it is of the first importance to comprehend the power behind\r\nthis imperial throne, which directs and controls it. Does it assume to\r\noriginate and establish principles in government and morals? Or does it\r\naspire only to the humbler office of propagating such ideas as have been\r\nsanctioned by the best judgment of the age, of illustrating their\r\noperation, and making them acceptable to the people? The fugitive essays\r\nand hurried comments on passing events, which fill the columns of\r\nnewspapers, do not ordinarily constitute solid foundations on which the\r\nprinciples of social or political action can be safely established. The\r\nmen usually employed in this work of distributing ideas, are not they\r\nwho are capable of building up substantial systems by the slow process\r\nof induction, or who can, by the opposite system, apply great general\r\ntruths to the purposes of national prosperity and happiness. They are\r\nfar too much engaged in the active business of life,--too deeply\r\ninvolved in the strifes and turmoils of mankind,--too thoroughly imbued\r\nwith the spirit of the passing hour, with all its passions and\r\nprejudices--to be the philosophic guides of humanity, and to lay down,\r\nwith the serene logic of truth, the bases of moral and political\r\nprogress. The inevitable sympathy between the editor and his daily\r\nreaders--the action and reaction which constantly take place and\r\ninsensibly lead the journalist into the paths of popular opinion and\r\npassion--these are too apt to render him altogether unfit to be an\r\noracle in the great work of social organization and government. The\r\ncommon sense of the multitude is often an invaluable corrective of\r\nspeculative error; but the impulses and strong prejudices of\r\ncommunities, though calculated to sweep along with them the judgments of\r\nall, are mostly pernicious, and sometimes dangerous in the extreme. The\r\ntrue remedy for these evils and dangers is, to employ in the management\r\nof the daily press, the noblest intellect, combined with the most\r\nincorruptible purity of motive. Commanding the entire confidence of the\r\nnation, and worthy of it, the lessons of this great teacher--the central\r\nlight-giving orb of civilization--will be received with reverence and\r\ngratitude, and with a benign and fructifying influence, something like\r\nthat which the sun sheds on the world of nature.\r\n\r\nA French philosopher, writing in 1840, says of us:\r\n\r\n     'This universal colony, notwithstanding the eminent temporal\r\n     advantages of its present position, must be regarded as, in fact,\r\n     in all important respects, more remote from a true social\r\n     reorganization than the nations from whom it is derived, and to\r\n     whom it will owe, in course of time, its final regeneration. The\r\n     philosophical induction into that ulterior state is not to be\r\n     looked for in America--whatever may be the existing illusions about\r\n     the political superiority of a society in which the elements of\r\n     modern civilization are, with the exception of industrial activity,\r\n     most imperfectly developed.'\r\n\r\nIt may be admitted that we are yet somewhat behind the foremost nations\r\nof Europe in the higher walks of philosophy, and certainly in the\r\npractical application of true social principles, which, as yet, we do\r\nnot fully comprehend, even if they do. But the conclusion of this author\r\ncannot be sound. However moderate may be our standard of knowledge in\r\nthe United States, this knowledge, such as it is, is more widely\r\ndiffused among the people who are to profit by it, than in any other\r\ncountry. If our attainments be comparatively small in philosophic\r\nstatesmanship, the whole population partakes more or less in such\r\nprogress as we have made; for education is universal, and whatever ideas\r\nare generated in the highest order of minds, soon become the familiar\r\npossession of all to the extremities of the land. Government yields with\r\nlittle opposition or delay to the interests and intelligence, and it may\r\nbe, to the ignorance of the people: there is no other nation on the\r\nglobe in which social forms and institutions are so plastic in the hands\r\nof wise and energetic men. By means of universal education and the\r\nperfect distribution of knowledge, we are laying the broadest possible\r\nbasis on which the noblest structure may be raised, if we can only\r\ncommand the wisdom to build aright. The question, therefore, is, whether\r\na whole people thoroughly educated and with the most perfect machinery\r\nfor the diffusion of knowledge, though starting from a moderate\r\ncondition of enlightenment, will outrun or fall behind other nations in\r\nwhich the few may be wiser, while the multitude is greatly more\r\nignorant, and in which the forms of government and of social,\r\norganization are more rigid, and inaccessible to change or improvement.\r\nTo answer this question will not cause much hesitation, at least in the\r\nmind of an American; and if we are not altogether what we think\r\nourselves, the wisest and best of mankind, we may at least claim to be\r\non the way to the highest improvement, with no serious obstacles in our\r\npath.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR FRIENDS ABROAD.\r\n\r\n  Two souls alone are friends of ours\r\n  In all the British isles;\r\n  Who sorrow for our darkened hours\r\n  And greet our luck with smiles.\r\n  \"And who may those twain outcasts be\r\n  Whose favor ye have won?\"\r\n  The first is Queen of England's realm,\r\n  The other that good Queen's son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAS HE SUCCESSFUL?\r\n\r\n     'Do but grasp into the thick of human life. Every one _lives_\r\n     it--to not many is it _known_; and seize it where you will, it is\r\n     interesting.'--_Goethe._\r\n\r\n     'SUCCESSFUL.--Terminating in accomplishing what is wished\r\n     or intended.'--_Webster's Dictionary._\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nDIAMOND CUT--PASTE.\r\n\r\nElihu Joslin belonged to that class of knaves who are cowardly as well\r\nas unscrupulous. He never hesitated to cheat where he had an\r\nopportunity, trusting to his powers of blustering and browbeating to\r\nsustain him. When these failed, that is, when he encountered persons who\r\nwere not imposed on nor intimidated by his swaggering, bullying mien, he\r\nshowed his craven nature by an abject submission. From being an errand\r\nboy in an old-established paper house in the city, he had himself become\r\nthe proprietor of a large business in the same line. He had but a single\r\nidea--to make money. And he did make it. His reputation among the trade\r\nwas very bad. But this did not, as it ought to have done, put him out of\r\nthe pale of business negotiations. Every merchant knows that there are\r\nmany rich men in business, whose acts of dishonesty and whose tricks\r\nform a subject of conversation and anecdote with their associates in\r\ntrade, yet who are not only tolerated, but are by some actually courted.\r\nJoslin, when quite a young man, had been the assignee of his employer,\r\nwho hoped to find in him a pliant tool. He soon found his mistake. He\r\nhad put himself completely in the power of his clerk, and the latter\r\ntook full advantage of it. The result was, his principal was beggared,\r\nand Joslin rose on his ruins.\r\n\r\nIt was a favorite practice with Joslin to discover men who were short of\r\nmoney, lend them what they wanted, and thus, after a while, get control\r\nof all they possessed. When Joslin first met Mr. Burns, he hoped to\r\nentangle him as he had his friend. But the former was too good a\r\nmerchant and in too sound a position to be brought in this way into his\r\ntoils. He was therefore obliged to have recourse to sheer knavery to\r\ncompass his object. The fact of Mr. Burns living so far from the city,\r\nthe great expense which would be entailed on him by a litigation, and\r\nthe natural repugnance he thought Mr. Burns would have to a lawsuit,\r\nemboldened him to employ the most high-handed measures to cheat him. The\r\nfact was, Mr. Burns's paper had become well known in the market, and\r\ncommanded a ready sale. The manufacture was even--the texture firm and\r\nhard. There was a continually increasing demand for it. Joslin\r\ndetermined on--even for him--some audacious strokes. He sent a lot of\r\nthe paper to an obscure auctioneer, one of his tools, and had it bid off\r\nin the name of a young man in his store. He thereupon reported the\r\nentire consignment to be unsalable, and credited Mr. Burns with the\r\nwhole lot at the auction prices, less expenses. In this way he claimed\r\nto have no funds when Mr. Burns's drafts became due, and called on the\r\nlatter for the ready money. The previous consignment he pretended to\r\nhave sold in the city, at a time when paper was much lower than usual,\r\nbut he had returned for this the then market price. Really he had not\r\nsold the paper at all. Knowing it was about to rise, he simply reported\r\na sale, and kept the paper on hand to take advantage of the market, and\r\nhe was now selling it at an advance of ten per cent, on the previous\r\nrates.\r\n\r\nMr. Burns had never before encountered so desperate a knave. As we have\r\nsaid, the affair troubled him greatly. True, he was determined to\r\ninvestigate it thoroughly, but he could not well afford the time to go\r\nhimself to New York. His chief man at the paper mill had failed to\r\naccomplish anything; so it was a great relief when Hiram volunteered his\r\nservices. Mr. Burns could not tell why, but he had a singular confidence\r\nthat Hiram would bring the matter out right. He was up to see his\r\nconfidential clerk off in the stage, which passed through Burnsville\r\nbefore daylight, and which was to call at the office for its passenger.\r\nFrom that office a light could be seen glimmering as early as three\r\no'clock. Hiram, after an hour or two in bed, where he did not close his\r\neyes, had risen, and taking his valise in his hand, had gone to the\r\noffice, and was again deep in the accounts. He would make memorandums\r\nfrom time to time, and at last wrote a brief note to Mr. Burns, asking\r\nhim to send forward by the first mail a full power of attorney. At\r\nlength the stage horn was heard. Hiram rose, opened his valise, and\r\nplaced his papers within it. The stage wheeled rapidly round the corner,\r\nand drew up at the office door; Hiram extinguished the light, seized his\r\nvalise, stepped quietly out, and was in the act of turning the key--he\r\nhad a duplicate--when Mr. Burns arrived.\r\n\r\n'I thought,' he said, 'I would see you off. You will have a fine day,\r\nand reach New Haven in ample time for the boat.'\r\n\r\n'I have left a brief note on your table,' responded Hiram, 'to ask for a\r\npower of attorney. I think it may be important.'\r\n\r\n'You shall have it. Good luck to you. Write me how you get along.\r\nGood-by.'\r\n\r\nHe shook Hiram's hand with an enthusiasm which belonged to his nature.\r\nThe latter extended his cold, dry palm to his employer, and said, 'Good\r\nmorning, sir,' and got inside. He did not in the least enter into Mr.\r\nBurns's cheerful, sympathizing spirit. If the truth must be told, he had\r\nnot the slightest sympathy for him; neither did any desire to extricate\r\nhim from this awkward business induce the present adventure. He cared no\r\nmore for Mr. Burns than he did for Mr. Joslin. But he did enjoy the idea\r\nof meeting that knave and circumventing him. It was the pleasantest\r\n'duty' he ever had undertaken. On it his whole thoughts were centred.\r\nWhat did he care whether the day was fair or foul--whether the roads\r\nwere good or bad? He longed to get to work at Joslin.\r\n\r\nThe stage door closed, and the vehicle rolled swiftly away. Mr. Burns\r\nstood a moment looking after it. He had felt the entire absence of\r\nresponsive sympathy in his clerk, and his old feeling returned, as it\r\ninvariably did at times. He walked slowly toward his house.\r\n\r\n'Why is it that I so often wish I was rid of that fellow, when he serves\r\nme so effectually?'\r\n\r\nMr. Burns turned before entering, and cast his eyes over the horizon.\r\nDaylight was just streaking the sky from the east. Joel Burns paused,\r\nand directed his glance over the town--the town he had founded and made\r\nto flourish. Tears stood in his eyes. Wherefore? He was thinking of the\r\ntime when, after Mr. Bellows's death, he had, step by step, carefully\r\ntravelled over this locality, while laying plans for his future career.\r\nHere--just here--he had marked four trees to indicate the site for his\r\nhouse, and here he had built it.\r\n\r\n'Oh, Sarah, why had you to leave me?'\r\n\r\nThe words, uttered audibly, recalled him to himself. He opened and\r\npassed through the gate, and stepped on the piazza.\r\n\r\n'Is that you, father?' It was his daughter's voice. He looked up and saw\r\nher at the window. 'I heard you go out, and I have been watching for you\r\never since. Did Mr. Meeker get off?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'Wait, father, and I will come down and take a walk with you. Wouldn't\r\nyou like it?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, dear, very much.'\r\n\r\nThey walked on together in silence. Presently Sarah perceived they were\r\ngoing in the direction of the burying ground. Mr. Burns entered it with\r\nhis daughter, and soon stood by his wife's grave.\r\n\r\n'She left us early, my child. You do not forget her?'\r\n\r\n'Oh no, father!'\r\n\r\n'Do you remember all about her--_all_?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, everything.'\r\n\r\n'I know it--I know you do. Why is it, Sarah, that lately I feel more\r\nsolitary than usual?'\r\n\r\n'Do you, father?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, since--' He paused, unwilling, it would seem, to finish the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n'You know, father, I have not been quite so much with you since Mr.\r\nMeeker came. You are more in the office.'\r\n\r\n'So I am. I wish--' He hesitated again. Evidently something oppressed\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nJust then the first slanting rays of the morning sun gleamed over the\r\nplace--pleasant rays, which seemed to change the current of Mr. Burns's\r\nthoughts, lighting up his soul as they were lighting the universe.\r\n\r\nHe spoke cheerfully: \"Let us run home, now. And, Sarah, won't you see\r\nthat we have a very nice breakfast? Early rising has given me an\r\nappetite.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nAll this time the stage was conveying Hiram Meeker toward his\r\ngoal--toward Elihu Joslin. He reached New Haven in time for the boat,\r\nand early the following morning was in New York. At this date the town\r\nhad not assumed its present magnificent proportions. Broadway, above\r\nCanal street, was lined with private residences instead of stores, and\r\nBleecker street was one of the most fashionable in the city.\r\nNevertheless it was already imposing, especially to a young man from the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nHiram had visited New York on two several occasions when a boy, in\r\ncompany with his mother, but latterly had not found any opportunity to\r\ndo so. Lauding from the boat, he made his way to the then leading hotel,\r\n'The Franklin House,' and entered his name, and presently went in to\r\nbreakfast. After he had finished, he stepped out on the sidewalk. He\r\nbeheld a continuous stream of human beings pouring along this\r\nextraordinary thoroughfare. Omnibuses, carts, wagons, and vehicles of\r\nevery description already filled the way.\r\n\r\nHiram stood and regarded the scene. 'What a field here!' he said to\r\nhimself. 'Look at this mass of people. Every other man an idiot--and of\r\nthe rest, not one in a thousand has more than a medium share of brains.\r\nWhat a field, indeed, to undertake to manage and direct and control\r\nthese fellows! What machinery though! Not too fast. This is the place\r\nfor me. Burnsville-pho! Now, friend Joslin, * * * *\r\n\r\nHiram made his way to the store of H. Bennett & Co., in Pearl street.\r\nMr. Bennett was in; glad to see Hiram, but wonderfully busy. He invited\r\nhis relative to dinner--indeed, asked him why he had not come direct to\r\nhis house. Then he turned away to business.\r\n\r\nAll this did not fluster Hiram in the slightest. He waited a few\r\nminutes; then took occasion to interrupt Mr. Bennett, and say he wished\r\nto speak with him on something of importance.\r\n\r\n'Certainly,' replied the other. 'What can I do for you?'\r\n\r\n'I come to New York on special business,' said Hiram. 'It is necessary I\r\nshould know just what kind of a person Elihu Joslin is--the large paper\r\ndealer in Nassau street. I have not your facilities for ascertaining,\r\nand I ask you, as a particular favor, to find out for me.'\r\n\r\n'Joslin!' exclaimed Mr. Bennett. 'I hope none of your people are in his\r\nclutches. He is a very hard case to deal with, so they say.'\r\n\r\n'Is he rich?'\r\n\r\n'Yes, worth a couple of hundred thousand, easy.'\r\n\r\n'How does he stand with the trade?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, unpopular enough, I should imagine. Can't tell you particularly--is\r\nnot in my line, you know; but if the matter is really pressing, you\r\nshall learn all you wish to in an hour.'\r\n\r\n'Thank you. I must know all about him prior to a personal interview,\r\nwhich I am to have.'\r\n\r\n'I see. Call in at twelve o'clock, and the information will be ready for\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\n'One word more. Do you know the house of Orris & Tweed, auctioneers?'\r\n\r\n'Orris & Tweed? Never heard their name before.'\r\n\r\n'It is in the directory.'\r\n\r\n'I dare say. That don't amount to anything.'\r\n\r\n'Please let me know something of them, too. I am sorry to give you this\r\ntrouble; but I am a greenhorn in New York, and have a difficult matter\r\non my hands.'\r\n\r\n'No trouble--at least, I don't count it such to help a friend in the way\r\nof business. Besides, if you are a greenhorn, you act as if you know\r\nwhat you are about.'\r\n\r\nH. Bennett, of the prosperous house of Bennett & Co., would not have\r\ndevoted five minutes extra to his namesake in the way of social chat;\r\nregarding such conduct in business hours, and in the busy season, as\r\nworse than superfluous; but as a matter of business, though purely\r\nincidental and profitless, he would have given the whole day to Hiram's\r\naffair, if absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett here gave some special directions to one of his numerous\r\nclerks, a sharp, active-looking fellow, with a keen eye and an air like\r\na game cock, who vanished as soon as they were received.\r\n\r\nHiram left the store, and turning into Wall street, walked on till he\r\nreached Nassau street, in which was the establishment of Elihu Joslin.\r\nHe strolled on without any special purpose, till his attention was\r\narrested by an obstruction on the sidewalk. It was simply the ordinary\r\ncircumstance of the delivery of goods. In this instance a dray was\r\nbacked up to the curbstone, with paper. Hiram looked at it carefully. It\r\nwas of Mr. Burns's manufacture. He glanced up to see the name of the\r\nhouse. It was not Joslin.\r\n\r\nA new thought flashed on him. Actuated by it, he commenced to speak with\r\nthe carman, but checked himself, and walked boldly into the store, and\r\nback to the counting room.\r\n\r\n'I see you have Burns's paper. I want to purchase a small quantity of\r\nit.'\r\n\r\n'We couldn't supply you, to-day--have just got this in to fill an order.\r\nHis paper stands so high that it is scarce in the market. How much do\r\nyou want? We may get some more in by Thursday.'\r\n\r\n'Only a few reams to make out an assortment. I suppose I can buy of you\r\non as good terms as of Joslin.'\r\n\r\n'For a small lot, I am sure, better; indeed, I have this direct from\r\nhim, which is the same thing as if sent from the mill. You know the\r\nmanufacturers will sell only to jobbers. You are in the retail line, I\r\npresume?'\r\n\r\n'I am; and I wish you would spare me a couple of reams out of this lot,\r\nand send them round to H. Bennett & Co.'s, Pearl street.'\r\n\r\nThe merchant recognized in Hiram a young country storekeeper, and,\r\ndesirous as all merchants are to make new acquaintances, was willing to\r\naccommodate him. H. Bennett & Co. was a first-class name, and this\r\ndecided him to break into the lot, which was already sold to somebody\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nHiram paid for his purchase, called up a carman instanter, and never\r\ntook his eye off the paper till it was delivered at Mr. Bennett's store.\r\n\r\nThat gentleman was standing at the door, saying good-by to a first-rate\r\ncustomer, when Hiram came up with his cart, and directed his two reams\r\nof paper to be deposited inside.\r\n\r\n'Well, youngster, what's all this? said Mr. Bennett, good humoredly.\r\n\r\n'A little speculation of mine,' quoth Hiram, quietly.\r\n\r\n'Well, men do sometimes buy their own _paper_, I know--that is, when\r\nthere is a promise to pay written on it; but this is a blank lot.'\r\n\r\n'It will prove a prize to me, unless I am mistaken.'\r\n\r\nMr. Bennett caught the general idea on the instant. The two exchanged\r\nlooks, such as are only current between very 'cute, knowing,\r\nsharp-witted men. Hiram was betrayed into returning Mr. Bennett's leer\r\nbefore he was aware of it. It was a spontaneous recognition, and he felt\r\nashamed at being thus thrown off his guard. He colored slightly, and\r\nsaid something about his duty to his employer.\r\n\r\n'There's where you're right,' replied Mr. Bennett. 'A man who does not\r\nserve his employer well will not serve himself well in the long run;\r\nthat you may be sure of.'\r\n\r\nThe conversation ended here. Hiram strolled out again for half an hour;\r\nand when he returned, Mr. Bennett was able to give him a daguerreotype\r\nof Elihu Joslin's character, which agreed with that with which we have\r\nalready favored the reader. As to 'Orris & Tweed, auctioneers,' they\r\nwere not much better than Peter Funks--lived by acting as stool pigeons,\r\nand cheating generally.\r\n\r\nHiram left the store rejoicing at this intelligence, and took his way\r\ndirect to Joslin's place. Inquiring if that personage was in, he was\r\ntold yes, but specially engaged. Hiram sat for a full hour, waiting\r\npatiently: then he was told to go into the private counting room.\r\n\r\nEntering, he beheld a large, overgrown, rough-looking man, about five\r\nand thirty, with black hair and eyes, and a coarse, florid complexion,\r\nwho looked up and nodded carelessly on his entering.\r\n\r\n'This is Mr. Joslin, I presume?'\r\n\r\nYes.'\r\n\r\n'My name is Meeker, I come from Burnsville--am in the employ of Mr.\r\nBurns.'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'I have come down to take a look at York, and knowing you owned half the\r\npaper mill, guessed you was a friend of Mr. Burns, and might not object\r\nto let some of your folks show me about a little.'\r\n\r\n'You don't belong in the mill, then?'\r\n\r\n'No; but I've been all over it. It's curious work--paper making.'\r\n\r\n'How long are you going to stay here?'\r\n\r\n'Well, I want to make a little visit and see the place. In fact, I've a\r\nnotion to come here by-and-by, and I would like to look about first.\r\nDon't you want a clerk yourself?'\r\n\r\n'What can you do?'\r\n\r\n'I can tend store first rate.'\r\n\r\n'What do you want to leave Burns for?'\r\n\r\n'I didn't say I wanted to leave him. He's a first-rate man, if he was\r\nonly a little sharper--got too many soft spots: that's what I hear folks\r\nsay. But I think I should like New York.'\r\n\r\n'Well, Nicker--'\r\n\r\n'Meeker, if you please.'\r\n\r\n'All right, I say, Meeker; we are pretty busy now, but if you want to\r\nsee the elephant--and I suppose you do--I will introduce you to one of\r\nmy boys, who will give you a chance.'\r\n\r\nHe stepped out, beckoning Hiram to follow.\r\n\r\n'Hill! Tell Hill to come here, some of you. Hill, this is Mr. Meeker, in\r\nthe employ of our particular friend, Mr. Burns, of Burnsville. He wants\r\nto see something of the city. You must do what you can for him. I would\r\nnot wish to slight any one, you know, who belongs with Mr. Burns.'\r\n\r\n'All right, sir,' said Hill, a jaunty, devil-may-care looking fellow,\r\nwith a sallow, sickly face, evidently the result of excess and\r\ndissipation.' If the young gentleman will tell me where he stops. I will\r\ncall for him this evening.'\r\n\r\n'At the Franklin House,' responded Hiram.\r\n\r\n'The devil!' exclaimed Joslin. 'Tall quarters, I should say.'\r\n\r\n'Ain't it a good place, sir? I was told it was a good house on board\r\nthe boat.'\r\n\r\n'Good! I should think it was. The best in New York. A dollar and a half\r\na day: did you understand that?'\r\n\r\n'No, sir; I did not ask the price.'\r\n\r\n'Green, that's a fact,' said Joslin to himself.' Never mind,' he\r\ncontinued, 'Hill will recommend you to his boarding place, if you like.\r\nGood day;' and Hiram took his leave.\r\n\r\n'I say, Hill, I want to find out how matters stand with Burns. You've\r\ngot just the chance now. Put this chap through generally. His mother\r\ndon't seem to know he's out. Don't mind a few dollars: you understand?\r\nAnd recollect, pump him dry.'\r\n\r\n'Dry as a sandbank,' said Hill, who was already chuckling over the sport\r\nin prospect.\r\n\r\nMr. Joslin continued his instructions, which, as they were of a strictly\r\nprivate nature, we should be violating confidence to record.\r\n\r\nHiram occupied himself the remainder of the day in looking about the\r\ntown. He took one of Brower's omnibuses and rode to the end of the route\r\nin Broadway, opposite Bond street. Here he descended and retraced his\r\nsteps. Broadway was then the general promenade. Hiram's pulse beat quick\r\nas he gazed on the beauty and fashion of the metropolis moving\r\nmagnificently along. Susceptible as he was, he had never before been so\r\nimpressed with female charms. He thought of the belles of Hampton and\r\nBurnsville with a species of disgust. His own costume, which he regarded\r\nas so perfect, he perceived had a provincial, country look, when\r\ncontrasted with that of the gentlemen he encountered. Now in business\r\nmatters, Hiram was as much at home and as self-possessed in New York as\r\nin Connecticut. But when it came to the display he now beheld, he felt\r\nand acknowledged his inferiority.\r\n\r\nHere Hiram _was_ green. He did not stop to reflect that fine feathers\r\nmake fine birds, so suddenly was he confronted with the glittering\r\npanorama. He continued to mingle with the crowd which swept along, and\r\nsometimes the blood would rush swiftly to his brain, causing him to\r\nreel, as dark eyes would be turned languidly on him, exhibiting, as he\r\nwas ready to believe, an incipient interest in his destiny.\r\n\r\nBelow Canal street the character of the current began to change, till\r\ngradually Hiram was freed from the exciting trial he had been subjected\r\nto. He collected his thoughts and brought his mind back to his work--and\r\nhis work Hiram Meeker never neglected. Slowly the old current drove out\r\nthe new. Gradually his mind returned to its even tenor. He walked\r\nthrough the custom house. He entered the exchange. He visited the\r\nshipping; and when he got back to the hotel, he was tired and hungry\r\nenough. But, tired and hungry as he was, he proceeded at once to open\r\nhis valise and take out a bundle of papers. Glancing over certain\r\naccount sales, his eye fell on the name of HILL as purchaser. A\r\npeculiar gleam of satisfaction passed over his face as he replaced the\r\npapers in his valise and went down to dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour, the young gentleman whom Mr. Joslin had addressed\r\nas 'Hill' waited on Hiram at the Franklin House. He sent up his card,\r\nand Hiram descended to meet him. He could scarcely recognize the young\r\nman before him, dressed in a ridiculous extreme of fashion, and covered\r\nwith rings, pins, and gold chains, as the clerk hard at work with coat\r\noff, superintending the stowing away of a lot of merchandise. But Hiram\r\nwas in no way deceived or taken in by the imposing manner in which Mr.\r\nHill had got himself up. He saw quickly the difference between the real\r\nand the flash fashionable. But he did not betray this by word or sign,\r\nand continued to maintain the character he had assumed of an\r\nunsophisticated, verdant country youth.\r\n\r\nMr. Hill at the outset proposed they should take a drink, to which Hiram\r\nreadily assented. They proceeded to the bar, when the young man asked\r\nhis companion what he would have.\r\n\r\n'A glass of lemonade,' replied Hiram.\r\n\r\n'Lemonade!' exclaimed the other. 'You don't call that drinking with a\r\nfellow, do you?'\r\n\r\n'I can't take anything stronger,' answered Hiram. 'I belong to the\r\ntemperance society.'\r\n\r\n'Temperance society!' retorted Hill, a good deal chapfallen that he was\r\nto lose his chief weapon of attack. 'I thought the pledge didn't hold\r\nwhen you were away from home?'\r\n\r\n'Oh, yes it does; our minister says it holds everywhere. Still, I\r\nwouldn't mind taking some soda and sarsaparilla, though Dr. Stevens says\r\nthere's alcohol in the sarsaparilla.'\r\n\r\nHiram was impracticable. Hill could not induce him even to take a little\r\nwine. He was so much chagrined that he poured out for himself a double\r\nportion of brandy, and, before he had finished it, regained his good\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\n'Well, what do you say to another glass? I think I can stand the brandy,\r\nif you can the lemonade.'\r\n\r\nHiram had no objections.\r\n\r\nHill lighted a segar. Hiram did not smoke.\r\n\r\n'I hope you are not going to refuse my next invitation,' said Hill. 'I\r\nhave got tickets for the theatre: what do you say?'\r\n\r\nHiram had often discussed the theatre question, both at the lyceum and\r\non other occasions. It was to be condemned--no doubt about it. But the\r\nRev. Mr. Goddard had once remarked in his hearing that he thought if a\r\ngood opportunity was presented for a young man to visit the theatre, he\r\nhad perhaps better do so, than feel an irritating curiosity all his life\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nSeeing Hiram hesitate, Hill proceeded to urge him. 'You had better go,'\r\nhe said. 'Lots to be seen. You don't know what you are losing, I tell\r\nyou.'\r\n\r\nHiram was not influenced by his companion's importunity, but he decided\r\nto go, nevertheless. The elder Kean was then in New York, and the old\r\nPark Theatre in all its glory. That evening Kean was to play Shylock in\r\nthe 'Merchant of Venice.' Hill, greatly pleased that at last he had made\r\nsome headway, took another glass of brandy and water, and the young men\r\nproceeded to the theatre. The house was crowded from galleries to pit.\r\nThe orchestra was playing when they entered.\r\n\r\nHiram was blinded by the brilliancy of the gaslights. His heart beat\r\nfast in spite of his effort to be composed.\r\n\r\nThe play began with some second-rate actors, who went through the first\r\nscene with the usual affected stage strut and tone. Hiram thought he\r\nnever witnessed anything more unnatural and ridiculous. Even in the\r\nsecond, where Portia and Nerissa hold a dialogue, he was rather\r\ndisgusted than otherwise. The machinery had scarcely been adjusted for\r\nthe third scene, when a storm of applause burst from all parts of the\r\nhouse; clapping of hands, stamping of feet, bravos, and various noises\r\nof welcome commingled, and Hiram beheld an old man enter, somewhat bent,\r\ndressed in a Hebrew cap and tunic, having a short cane, which would\r\nserve either for support or as a means of defence. As he advanced, he\r\ncast sidelong, suspicious, and sinister glances from beneath bushy,\r\nbeetling eyebrows.\r\n\r\nAt first Hiram was inclined to believe it was a real personage, so\r\nnatural was his entrance--so destitute of all trick, or of anything got\r\nup.\r\n\r\n'That's Kean,' whispered Hill.\r\n\r\nHiram held his breath as the words of the Jew broke distinctly on the\r\nhouse:\r\n\r\n'_Three thousand ducats--well._'\r\n\r\nHe entered at once with the deepest interest into the play. With head\r\nleaning forward, eyes open wide and fixed on the speaker, he drank in\r\nevery word. From the first he sympathized with the main character. When\r\nShylock went on to say: 'Yet his means are in supposition: he hath an\r\nargosy bound to Tipolis, another to the Indies. I understand, moreover,\r\nupon the Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England; and\r\nother ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships are but boards,\r\nsailors but men. There be land rats and water rats, land thieves and\r\nwater thieves--I mean pirates; and there is the peril of waters, winds,\r\nand rocks. The man is notwithstanding sufficient:'--Hiram unconsciously\r\nshook his head, as if he doubted it.\r\n\r\nHis whole soul was now centred in the performance. When it came to the\r\ntrial, in the fourth act, he turned and twisted his body, as if he could\r\nwith difficulty abstain from advising Shylock to accept the offer of\r\nBassanio: 'For the three thousand ducats here is six.'\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Hiram felt any sympathy for the merchant who was\r\nto lose the pound of flesh; but for Shylock, when turned out of court\r\nstripped of all he had, it was intense. When at last he exclaims:\r\n\r\n  'Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:\r\n  You take my house when you do take the prop\r\n  That doth sustain my house; you take my life\r\n  When you do take the means whereby I live:'\r\n\r\nHiram leaned back, and exclaimed audibly: 'It's too bad, I declare!'\r\n\r\nAll this time, Hill sat as quietly as he could. He laughed whenever\r\nLauncelot Gobbo appeared; and tried hard to get Hiram to go out and take\r\nmore lemonade between the acts. Hiram would not move. He offered to\r\nintroduce him to lots of pretty girls whom he pointed out in the\r\ndistance; but it was useless. Hill began to think he would not make much\r\nof Hiram, after all. The evening was past, and he had as yet\r\naccomplished just nothing.\r\n\r\nThe play was over. The farce had been performed. It did not interest\r\nHiram. He thought everything over-strained and unnatural. It was now\r\nlate, Hiram had declined various seductive invitations of Hill, when the\r\nlatter finally insisted they should have some oysters. Hiram assented,\r\nand the two descended into Windust's.\r\n\r\n'Well, old fellow, what are you doing here?' was Hill's exclamation to a\r\nyoung man with notebook and pencil, seated at one of the small tables,\r\non which already smoked an oyster stew and some brandy toddy.\r\n\r\n'Hallo, Hill, is that you? Sit down. What will you have?' was the reply.\r\n\r\nHiram regarded the speaker curiously. He was twenty-two or three years\r\nold--serious looking, with black hair, dark eyes, and pale, bony\r\nfeatures. He had the easy, indifferent air of one careless of opinion,\r\nor independent of it.\r\n\r\n'My friend, Mr. Meeker, from Connecticut.'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Meeker, Mr. Innis.'\r\n\r\nAfter these salutations, the parties sat down, and orders were given.\r\n\r\n'Excuse me,' said Innis; 'I am not quite through my work.'\r\n\r\n'Go ahead,' replied Hill; whereat the other proceeded with his pencil\r\nand notebook, scratching away in a most rapid manner.\r\n\r\nSeeing Hiram look as if he did not exactly comprehend the employment,\r\nHill remarked, 'Innis is _item_ man and reporter for the _Clarion_, and\r\nyou will see his notice of Kean's performance, which he is just\r\nfinishing, in to-morrow morning's paper.'\r\n\r\nThis struck Hiram as rapid work, considerably increasing his respect for\r\nthe stranger, and led him to regard Innis still more critically. His\r\nappearance had impressed him favorably from the first.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he exclaimed, 'Wern't you at Newton Academy?'\r\n\r\n'Yes; and so were you. I remember now. You were a little fellow. You\r\ntook the first prize in bookkeeping.'\r\n\r\n'And _you_ learned shorthand of Chellis.'\r\n\r\n'Which counts now, at any rate. I should starve without it.'\r\n\r\nDuring this colloquy Hill sat in utter amazement.\r\n\r\n'You a Newton boy?' he exclaimed at last.\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Hiram.\r\n\r\n'And you know him, and no mistake?' to Innis.\r\n\r\nInnis nodded.\r\n\r\n'Then old Joslin may go to the devil. I--'\r\n\r\n'He'll go soon enough, and without your permission; and if you are not\r\ncareful, you'll go with him,' interrupted Innis, rising. 'I am all right\r\nnow,' he continued. 'I've but to step a block and a half and back. I\r\nwill be with you again in three minutes;' and he darted off to hand in\r\nhis evening's report.\r\n\r\nHill sat looking at Hiram, who, with all his impenetrability wore a\r\nsurprised and puzzled expression.\r\n\r\n'You don't remember me,' he said.\r\n\r\n'No.'\r\n\r\n'Why, I am Deacon Hill's son, of Newton. I quit the academy, I guess,\r\njust about the time you came. Innis and I were there together. Well, I\r\ndeclare, your innocent look threw me off the track; but I have seen you\r\nmany a time in Hampton. You used to be with Jessup, didn't you?'\r\n\r\n'Yes.'\r\n\r\n'You've been coming possum over Joslin; isn't it so?'\r\n\r\n'I don't understand you.'\r\n\r\n'Oh, never mind; he's a cursed knave, anyway. I shall quit him first of\r\nJanuary--keeps me on promises and the lowest kind of a salary, and no\r\nend of the dirty work--'\r\n\r\n'Such as sham sales of my employer's paper sold A.H. Hill,' interrupted\r\nHiram, dryly.\r\n\r\n'Hallo! where did you get hold of that?' said Hill, laughing.\r\n\r\nHiram made no reply; and Innis entering at this moment, the subject was\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\nHill, who had already imbibed more than was good for him, ordered a\r\nbrandy toddy; and Hiram, true to his temperance principles, partook of a\r\ncup of hot coffee. Before the toddy was half finished, Hill, who was\r\nalready illustrating the proverb that 'children, fools, and drunken men\r\nspeak truth,' commenced again about his employer, Joslin.\r\n\r\n'Really, Mr. Hill, I don't think you ought to refer to your confidential\r\nrelations with your principal,' said Hiram, gravely. He knew, cunning\r\nfellow, it would only be adding fuel to the fire.\r\n\r\n'You be----,' said Hill. 'I tell you what it is, Innis: here's a sell.\r\nI'm fairly come over. He is on Joslin's track--I know it, and I'll own\r\nup.' He thereupon proceeded to give a general account of Joslin, and how\r\nhe did business, and what a cowardly, lying knave he was.\r\n\r\nInnis laughed. Hiram was quiet, but he did not miss a word. The little\r\nsupper was finished, and the trio rose to depart.\r\n\r\n'I had no idea it was so late,' said Innis.\r\n\r\n'Have you far to go?' said Hiram.\r\n\r\n'Yes, to Chelsea; and the omnibuses have stopped.'\r\n\r\n'Come and stay with me: I have a very nice room.'\r\n\r\nInnis saw Hiram was in earnest, and after a little hesitation he\r\nassented. Hill bid them good night, and hiccoughed off toward his own\r\nquarters; and Hiram with Innis went to the Franklin House.\r\n\r\nWhen these young men reached their room, they did not go to bed. They\r\nsat up for an hour or two. What this conference led to we shall see\r\nby-and-by.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nHiram rose early, notwithstanding the late hours of the previous night.\r\nInnis breakfasted with him and then took his departure. On going to the\r\npost office, Hiram found a letter from Mr. Burns, enclosing a full power\r\nof attorney, as he had requested. He then went to H. Bennett & Co.,\r\nwhere he took up at least an hour of that gentleman's time, apparently\r\nquite to that gentleman's satisfaction. Thence Hiram proceeded to the\r\noffice of a well-known counsellor at law, who had been recommended to\r\nhim by Mr. Bennett.\r\n\r\nThe day was spent in preparing certain ominous-looking documents. I am\r\ntold that on the occasion Hiram exhibited a breadth and clearness of\r\ncomprehension which astonished the counsellor, who could not help\r\nsuggesting to the young man that he would make an excellent lawyer,\r\nwhich compliment Hiram received with something very like a sneer. That\r\nevening Hiram went to bed early. He slept well. His plans were\r\nperfected--his troops in order of battle, only waiting for the signal to\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\nHe awoke about sunrise, and rang his bell. A sleepy servant at length\r\nreplied to it.\r\n\r\n'Bring me a _Clarion_,' said Hiram.\r\n\r\n'The papers won't be along, sir, for half an hour.'\r\n\r\n'Well, let me have one the moment they come. Here's a quarter; bring a\r\n_Clarion_ quick, and I shall ask no change.'\r\n\r\nI record this instance of an impatient spirit in Hiram, as probably the\r\nlast he ever exhibited through his whole life. What could cause it?\r\n\r\nPresently the waiter came back. The _Clarion_ was in his hand. Hiram\r\ntook it eagerly, turned swiftly to the 'City Items,' and nodded with\r\nintense satisfaction as his eye rested on one paragraph.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt ten o'clock precisely, Hiram presented himself at the counting room\r\nof Elihu Joslin. Again he was forced to wait some time, and again he\r\nwaited most patiently.\r\n\r\n[I ought to state that Hill, in order to keep up his credit with his\r\nemployer, his bravado being sensibly cooled the following morning, had\r\nmade up all sorts of stories about Mr. Burns's affairs, which, as he\r\nreported, had been pumped from Hiram, whom he professed to have left in\r\na most dilapidated state at the hotel.]\r\n\r\nAt length Mr. Joslin would see Hiram. The latter entered and sat down.\r\n\r\n'Well, my young friend,' said the merchant, 'what do you think of New\r\nYork? Equal to Burnsville, eh? Did Hill do the polite thing by you?'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Joslin,' said Hiram, seriously, and quite in his natural manner,\r\nwhile he fixed his quiet but strangely searching eyes on him, 'I have an\r\nimportant communication to make to you?'\r\n\r\n'Well?'\r\n\r\n'I am not what I appear to be!'\r\n\r\n'No? What the devil are you then?'\r\n\r\n'I am the CONFIDENTIAL CLERK of Joel Burns, sent here by him to ferret\r\nout and punish your rascalities. Stay,' continued Hiram--perceiving\r\nJoslin was about to break forth in some violent demonstrations. 'Sit\r\ndown, sir, and hear me through quietly. It is your best course. It is\r\nyour ONLY course. Now listen. You have undertaken to cheat my\r\nemployer. You have rendered false accounts of sales, using your own\r\nclerks for sham purchasers, and employing stool-pigeon auctioneers. You\r\nhave attempted to swindle him generally. I have the whole story here.\r\n_You are in my power_.'\r\n\r\n'By----! that's more than I'll stand,' shouted Joslin, 'from any d----d\r\nConnecticut Yankee.'\r\n\r\n'Stop,' said Hiram, authoritatively. 'A word more, and you are ruined\r\npast all redemption. Read that,' and he handed him the _Clarion_,\r\nplacing his finger on a particular paragraph. Joslin took the paper. His\r\nhand trembled, but he managed to read as follows:\r\n\r\n     'Some extraordinary disclosures have reached us, involving a\r\n     wholesale paper house in Nassau street in large swindling\r\n     transactions. We forbear to give the name of the party implicated,\r\n     but understand that the police to-morrow will be in possession of\r\n     the facts.'\r\n\r\n'Here,' said Hiram, showing a bundle of papers, 'are the documents.\r\nOutside there on the curbstone stands an officer. I mean to make short\r\nwork of it. Will you behave rationally or not?'\r\n\r\nJoslin sat down.\r\n\r\n'What do you want?' he said at length.\r\n\r\n'I want nothing but what is HONEST, sir--_that_ I mean to\r\nhave,' said Hiram, in a mild, but very firm tone. 'Here is the account\r\nas it ought to be rendered. Look it over, and put your name to it.'\r\n\r\n'Really, this will take time--a good deal of time,' said Joslin,\r\nrecovering from his stupor. 'I must consult my bookkeeper.'\r\n\r\n'You will consult nobody, and you will settle this account before I\r\nleave the room.'\r\n\r\nJoslin took the document. He trembled from head to foot. He saw himself\r\ncompletely circumvented.\r\n\r\nHiram proceeded to show him just how the account ought to stand. Very\r\ncoolly and very accurately he went through the whole.\r\n\r\n'I suppose you are right,' said Joslin, moodily, and he affixed his\r\nsignature to the paper, and began to think he was getting off easy.\r\n'Now, do you want anything more of me?'\r\n\r\n'Yes,' said Hiram, 'considerably more. You own one half of the paper\r\nmill with Mr. Burns. You must sell out to him. Here is an agreement to\r\nsell, drawn ready for your signature.'\r\n\r\n'D----d if I will do it for all Burnsville! You've settled with me, and\r\nyou can't stir a peg farther. Outwitted yourself this time!' said\r\nJoslin, triumphantly.\r\n\r\n'Not quite so fast. _You_ have settled with Mr. Burns by signing that\r\npaper, which gives the lie to your other accounts, and is so much\r\nevidence for me before a police court; but Mr. Burns has _not_ settled\r\nwith you, and _won't_ settle with you till you bind yourself, by signing\r\nthis document, to sell out to him, on reasonable terms.'\r\n\r\nJoslin was again struck dumb.\r\n\r\n'You will receive,' continued Hiram, 'just what you paid for it, less my\r\nexpenses, and charges for my time and trouble in coming to New York,\r\ncounsel fees, and so forth; and you may think yourself fortunate in\r\nfalling into conscientious hands!'\r\n\r\nNot to pursue the interview farther, Hiram accomplished just exactly\r\nwhat he undertook to do before he entered Joslin's store that morning.\r\nThe accounts were made right, and Hiram turned to leave the store with\r\nthe agreement to sell in his pocket. He stopped before going out.\r\n\r\n'Mark you,' he said; 'when Joel Burns gets a clean deed of your half the\r\npaper mill, according to this agreement, I will tear up these little\r\ndocuments'--exhibiting some law papers. 'Don't forget. You have\r\nundertaken to settle with me. I shan't have settled with you till I get\r\nthe deed. Good morning.'\r\n\r\nIt was only twelve o'clock when all this was concluded. Hiram marched\r\nout of the store triumphant. His impulse on touching the pavement was to\r\njump up and down, run, kick up his heels, and shout all sorts of huzzas.\r\nHe did none of these, but walked up to the Park very quietly, and then\r\ninto Broadway. But his heart beat exultantly. A glow of absolute\r\nsatisfaction suffused his mental, moral, and physical system. It was\r\njust the happiest moment of his life. The day was fine--the air clear\r\nand bracing. Broadway was filled to overflowing. How he enjoyed the\r\npromenade! It was when turning to retrace his steps, after reaching the\r\nlimits of fashionable resort, that his feelings became so buoyant that\r\nit seemed as if he must find some outlet for them. The exquisite beauty\r\nof the ladies, the richness of their dresses, and the air and style with\r\nwhich they glided along, put new excitement into his soul.\r\n\r\n'One of these days I shall make their acquaintance. Oh! what a place\r\nthis is,' he muttered.\r\n\r\nUnconsciously he stopped quite still, almost in an ecstacy.\r\n\r\nAt that moment his attention was attracted by a hearse, which, having\r\naccomplished its task, was proceeding at a rapid rate up Broadway.\r\nCareening this way and that, it jolted swiftly over the pavement. The\r\ndriver, either hardened by habit, or, it may be, a little tipsy,\r\nexhibited a rollicking, reckless air, as he urged his horse along. As he\r\ncame opposite Hiram, their eyes met. Influenced by I know not what,\r\nperhaps for a joke, perhaps to give the young fellow who was so\r\nverdantly staring at him a start, he half checked the animal, as if\r\nabout to pull up, and gesturing to Hiram in the style of an omnibus\r\ndriver, motioned him to get inside!\r\n\r\nNever before, never afterward, did Hiram receive such a shock. Dismay\r\nwas so evident on his face, that the man gave vent to a coarse laugh at\r\nthe success of his experiment, applied the lash to his brute, and dashed\r\nfuriously on.\r\n\r\nWhat sent that hearse along just then and there? It gave you a ghostly\r\nreminder, Hiram. It made you recollect that you were not to lose sight\r\nof the other side.\r\n\r\nThat morning Hiram forgot, yes, _forgot_ to say his prayers. So entirely\r\nwas he carried away by the Joslin business, that for once he neglected\r\nthis invariable duty. Now this was not singular under the circumstances.\r\nTo a genuine spirit the omission would have been followed by no morbid\r\nrecollections. As Hiram, after the affair of the hearse, took his way to\r\nthe hotel, the fact that he had not sought God's blessing on his\r\nmorning's work suddenly presented itself. He was persuaded the shock he\r\nreceived was providential. Arrived at the Franklin, he mounted to his\r\nroom, and read three or four times the customary amount in the Bible,\r\nand prayed longer and more energetically than he ever did before in his\r\nlife. He was now much more calm, but still a good deal depressed. It was\r\nnot till after he had partaken of an excellent dinner that he felt\r\nentire equanimity.\r\n\r\nThat evening Hiram was to spend at Mr. Bennett's. True to his rule,\r\nwhich he applied with severity, not to let pleasure interfere with\r\nbusiness, he had declined all his cousin's invitations. Now he was at\r\nliberty to go and enjoy himself. Mr. Bennett lived in a very handsome\r\nhouse in a fashionable street. His daughters were all older than Hiram,\r\nbut still they were very pretty, and by no means _passée_. Mrs. Bennett\r\nwas quite a grand lady. Mr. B. received Hiram very cordially, and asked\r\nimmediately how he had got along. Hiram replied briefly. Mr. B. was\r\ndelighted. Mrs. B. received Hiram very graciously, but with something of\r\na patronizing manner, very different from what she exhibited when\r\nspending several weeks at Hampton. The two girls were more cordial.\r\nHiram's country-bred politeness, which omitted not the least point\r\nrequired by books of etiquette, amused them much as the vigorous and\r\nvery scientific dancing of a country belle amuses the city-bred girl who\r\nwalks languidly through the measure. Notwithstanding, Hiram managed to\r\nmake himself agreeable. It was not till two or three young gentlemen of\r\nthe city came in that they showed slight signs of weariness, and Hiram\r\nwas transferred to mamma. Our hero was not slow to perceive the\r\ndisadvantage under which he labored. He was not one whit discouraged. He\r\nwatched his rivals closely. He smiled occasionally in disdain while\r\nlistening to some of the conversation. 'They are almost fools,' he said\r\nto himself. 'The tailor has done the whole.' Never mind, I can afford to\r\nwait.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next morning Hiram took the boat for New Haven, and on the following\r\nmorning reached Burnsville. He had written but a line to Mr. Burns, to\r\nacknowledge the receipt of the power of attorney, and had given his\r\nemployer no inkling of what he was attempting to do.\r\n\r\nAs the stage, a little after sunrise, drove into that beautiful village,\r\nHiram felt glad to get back to its quiet, charming repose. He thought of\r\nthe glare and hustle and excitement of New York with no satisfaction,\r\ncontrasted with the placid beauty of the scene he now witnessed. The\r\nidea of being welcomed by Louisa and Charlotte Hawkins filled his mind\r\nwith pleasure, and Sarah Burns did not at that moment suffer in\r\ncomparison with the Miss Bennetts.\r\n\r\n'It _is_ a happy spot!' said Hiram. 'Can I do better than stay in it?'\r\n\r\nIt was an instinct of his better nature which spoke. He had given way to\r\nit for a moment, but _only_ for a moment. The next, the old sense\r\nreturned and was triumphant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stage whirled on, and soon Hiram was driven up to the house of Mrs.\r\nHawkins. How rejoiced they all were to see him! The widow Hawkins had\r\nmissed him so much! As for Louisa and Charlotte, they were ready to\r\ndevour him.\r\n\r\nHiram hurried through his breakfast, hastily adjusted his toilette, and\r\nwalked over to Mr. Burns's house. He rang the bell. The door was opened\r\nby Mr. Burns himself. He greeted Hiram most cordially.\r\n\r\n'I did not expect you back so soon. Come in; we are just sitting down to\r\nbreakfast.'\r\n\r\n'I have already breakfasted,' said Hiram, 'and am going to the office.\r\nPlease look these papers over,' he continued. 'By them you will see\r\nprecisely what I have been able to do.'\r\n\r\nMr. Burns took the papers and turned to go in. He thought Hiram had\r\naccomplished little, and he did not wish to mortify him by asking what.\r\n\r\nJust then Sarah Burns came tripping down stairs, and, passing her\r\nfather, extended her hand to Hiram, and said:\r\n\r\n'Welcome back! What have you done?'\r\n\r\n'Do not forget your promise,' replied Hiram, in a low, distinct tone. 'I\r\nhave WON!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAURORA.\r\n\r\n     'For Waterloo,' says Victor Hugo, 'was not a battle: it was a\r\n     change of front of the universe.'\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat events are developed by nearness. \"To-day,\" says Emerson, \"is a\r\nking in disguise.\" Probably half the soldiers of Constantine's army\r\nregarded their leader's adoption of the Cross as his sign of hope and\r\ntriumph as of small account. Their pay and rations, their weapons, their\r\nofficers, were the same as before; the enemy before them, their duty to\r\nbeat him, were unchanged. What availed a symbol more or less on the\r\nimperial banner? Even admit that it indicated the emperor's personal\r\nrejection of the old and adoption of the newer faith, what of that?\r\nWould not everybody else abide by the religion of his own choice,\r\nwhatever that might be? Away, then, with all theological babble, which\r\nplain people can never half understand! Rome and the emperor for ever!\r\nYet in that despised symbol, announcing that the Empire had become the\r\nprotector instead of the persecutor of the Christian faith, was the germ\r\nof a greater transformation than was wrought by the Deluge.\r\n\r\nThe Proclamation of Freedom by President Lincoln is doubtless open to\r\ncriticism. Why did he not declare all slaves emancipated? Why not make\r\nsuch legal manumission operative at once? Why intimate that certain\r\nStates should (or might) be excepted from its operation? Why not declare\r\nthe slaves liberated because of the essential, inevitable wrong of\r\nholding them in bondage? Why not appeal to God for His blessing on the\r\ncause henceforward inseparably identified with that of Right and\r\nLiberty? Such questions may be multiplied indefinitely; but to what end?\r\nWhat matters that the Proclamation might or should be different, since\r\nwe have practical concern only with the Proclamation as it is?\r\n\r\nFor more than a lifetime, slavery has been accepted and regarded as a\r\nnational institution. The American in Europe was \"perplexed in the\r\nextreme\" by the questionings and criticisms of humane, intelligent\r\nobservers, who could not comprehend how a country should contain Four\r\nMillions of slaves by the official census, yet not be a slaveholding\r\ncountry. With our capital a slaveholding city; with our fortresses in\r\ngood part constructed by the labor of slaves; with our flag the chief\r\nshelter of the African Slave Trade, and our statute book disgraced by\r\nthe most arbitrary and inhuman Fugitive Slave Law ever devised, it _was_\r\na nice operation to prove this no slaveholding country, but only one\r\nwherein certain citizens, by virtue of local laws, over which we had no\r\ncontrol, were permitted to hold Blacks in slavery. And, when it is\r\nnotorious that the active partisans of slavery filled every Federal\r\noffice, even in the nominally free States, and excluded rigorously from\r\noffice every opponent of the baleful system, it is certain that the\r\nshrug of the polite Frenchman who listened to our demonstration that\r\nours, after all, was not a slaveholding country, was an indication of\r\ncomplaisance rather than of conviction. To prove this nothing of the\r\nsort, while Brazil was placed at the head of modern slaveholding\r\ncountries, was to overtax the resources of human sophistry.\r\n\r\nThe Proclamation is an immense fact. If it were no more than a\r\nrecognition from the highest quarter of the deadly antagonism between\r\nslavery and the Union, it would have inexhaustible significance. The\r\nAmerican republic, bleeding at every pore while fighting desperately for\r\nlife, arraigns slavery as her chief enemy and peril. The truth was long\r\nsince clear to every candid mind; but truth gains force by recognition.\r\nThousands realize a fact thus proclaimed, who have hitherto ignored and\r\nresisted it.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years, the charge of disloyalty has borne heavily on the\r\nAmerican champion of Universal Liberty. True, as to a very few, who\r\ncould not obtain the assent of their consciences to compacts which bound\r\nthem to aid the oppressor against his victim, they were made a weapon of\r\noffense against all. Abolitionists were execrated and hooted by the mob\r\nas champions at once of Negro Equality and of National dissolution.\r\n\r\nThe times are bravely altered. The partnership between Slavery and\r\nUnionism is absolutely dissolved. Like most divorces, this involves a\r\ndeadly quarrel. Not even the soaring platitudes of George Francis Train\r\ncan longer evoke cheers for the Union blent with curses on Abolition. In\r\na strictly, sternly real sense, \"Liberty and Union\" are henceforth \"one\r\nand inseparable!\"\r\n\r\nFor thirty years, our great seaboard merchants, our shippers, our\r\nfactors, have given their patronage to pro-slavery journals and their\r\nvotes to pro-slavery politicians, with intent to preserve the Union and\r\nlay the red spectre of civil war. Their recompense is found in the\r\nrepudiation of the immense debts for merchandise due them from the\r\nSouth, and a gigantic war waged by the Slave Power for the overthrow of\r\nthe Union. The profits of a lifetime of obsequious pandering to the\r\nmaster crime of our era are swept away at a blow, and the arm that\r\nstrikes it is that of the monster they have made such sacrifices of\r\nconscience and manhood to conciliate. Was ever retribution more signal?\r\n\r\nTo-day, the American Union, through the official action of its President\r\nand Congress, stands distinctly on the side of Liberty for All. Its\r\nsuccess in the fearful struggle forced upon it involves the overthrow\r\nand extinction of American slavery. The sentiment of nationality, the\r\ninstinct which impels every people to deprecate and resist the\r\ndismemberment and degradation of their country, the impulse of loyalty,\r\nare all arrayed against the traitorous \"institution\" which, after having\r\nso long bent the Union to its ends, now seeks its destruction. It once\r\nseemed to the majority patriotic to champion slavery; it is now a sacred\r\nduty to resist the bloody Moloch unto death.\r\n\r\nThe very hesitation of the President to take the decisive step gives\r\nweight to his ultimate decision. The compromisers have never tired of\r\neulogizing his firmness, his candor, his patience, his clearness of\r\nvision, his independence, and his unsectional patriotism. His\r\nassociations were largely with the Border State school of conservatives.\r\nHis favorite counsellor was the most eminent and sturdy Republican\r\nopponent of an emancipation policy. His decision in favor of that\r\npolicy, like the Proclamation which announces it, is entirely his own.\r\nThe \"pressure\" to which he deferred was that of an urgent public\r\nnecessity and the emphatic conviction of the great mass of our loyal\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nAnd, though few days have elapsed since the Proclamation was uttered,\r\nthe evils predicted by its opponents are already banished to the limbo\r\nof chimera. Those officers who threatened to resign in case an\r\nemancipation policy were adopted make no haste to justify their menaces.\r\nAs yet, not one of them has done so; in time, a few may screw their\r\ncourage to the sticking-point. There are enough who can be spared; and\r\nthey are generally those who deprecate and denounce an \"Abolition war.\"\r\nMay they yet prove men of their word!\r\n\r\nOutside of the army, the general feeling is one of wonder that this act\r\nof direst portent to the rebellion has been so long delayed. Even the\r\nrebels share in this amazement. When secession was first openly mooted\r\nat the South, every Unionist argued that secession was practical\r\nabolition. It has puzzled them to comprehend the weary months through\r\nwhich their prophecies were left unfulfilled. They will be perplexed no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\nThe Opposition in the loyal States is manifestly weakened by the\r\nProclamation. Their dream is of wearing out the Unionists by\r\ndisappointments and delays, restoring a Democratic ascendency in the\r\ngovernment, and then buying back the rebels to an outward loyalty by new\r\nconcessions and guaranties to slavery. Hence torpid campaigns, languid\r\nstrategy, advances without purpose, and surrenders without necessity.\r\nBut the policy of emancipation brings the quarrel to a speedy decision.\r\nThe rebel States must promptly triumph or brave a social dissolution.\r\nEvery Union advance into a rebel region henceforth clears a broad\r\ndistrict of slaves. The few are hurried off by their masters; the many\r\nescape to a land of freedom. How signally this process will be\r\naccellerated after the first of January, few will yet believe. Let the\r\nwar simply go on, with fluctuating fortunes, for a year or two longer,\r\nand the new slave empire will be nearly denuded of slaves. The process\r\nis at once inevitable and irresistible. Whether the able-bodied slaves\r\nthus escaping to the loyal States shall or shall not be used in whatever\r\nway they may be found most serviceable against the cruel despotism which\r\nso long robbed them of their earnings while crushing out their manhood,\r\nis purely a question of time. There are thousands who would last year\r\nhave revolted against the employment of Blacks in any way in our\r\nstruggle, who are now ripe for it: every week, as it transpires, adds to\r\ntheir number. Loyal men hesitated at first, believing that the rebellion\r\nwould easily and speedily be put down. These have now discovered their\r\nmistake and amended it. An aristocracy of three hundred thousand\r\ngenerally capable, energetic persons, accustomed to rule, and\r\nrecognizing a deadly foe in every opponent of their wishes, surrounded\r\nby twice so many shrewd and skilful parasites, and wielding the entire\r\nresources of ten millions of people, are not easily conquered. The poor\r\nWhites fill the ranks of their armies; the Blacks grow the food and\r\nperform the labor essential to the subsistence of those armies and of\r\ntheir families. Slavery unassailed is the strongest natural base of a\r\ngigantic rebellion: it easily adapts all the resources of a people to\r\nthe stern exigencies of war. Slavery resisted and undermined is a very\r\ndifferent affair, as the annals of this struggle are destined to prove.\r\n\r\nLet no doubts, then, vex the mind of a single hearty Unionist as to the\r\nissue of our great contest. The Proclamation has not added a thousand to\r\nthe number of our enemies, while it has supplied four millions with the\r\nmost cogent reasons for being henceforth our friends. These millions are\r\nhumble, ignorant, timid, distrustful, and now grinding in the\r\nprison-house of the traitors. They are not, let us frankly admit, the\r\nequals in prowess, capacity, or opportunity, of four millions of Whites;\r\nbut they are, nevertheless, human beings; they have human affections and\r\naspirations, and they feel the stirrings of the universal and\r\nindestructible human longing for liberty. \"Breaking in a nigger\" is a\r\nrough and pretty effectual process: it crushes down the manhood of its\r\nsubject, but does not crush it out. Should the republic say to-morrow to\r\nits Black step-children, \"We want one hundred thousand of you to aid in\r\nthis struggle against the slaveholding rebels, and will treat you in\r\nevery respect as human beings should be treated,\" it would not have to\r\nwait long for the full number. Hitherto a low prejudice, studiously\r\nfostered by Democratic politicians for the vilest party ends, has\r\nrepelled and expelled this abused race from the militia service of the\r\nUnion. The exclusion is absurd where its impulse is not treasonable, and\r\nmust share the fate of all absurdities. \"Would you,\" asked a Unionist of\r\na Democrat, \"refuse the aid of a negro, if you were assailed and your\r\nlife threatened by an assassin?\" \"Yes,\" replied the Democrat; \"I would\r\nrather be killed by a White man than saved by a nigger.\" Who does not\r\n_know_ that this man at heart sympathizes with the rebellion, and\r\ndeprecates the War for the Union as unnecessary and ruinous?\r\n\r\nThat war will go on. Our new and vast levies, our new iron-clads, our\r\nnew policy, will add immensely to the strength already put forth in\r\nvindication of the rightful authority of the Federal government and the\r\nintegrity of the Union. Yet a little while, and the immense superiority\r\nin every respect of the moral and material forces of the loyal States\r\nwill make themselves felt and respected. Yet a little while, and the\r\nauthority of the Nation will be acknowledged by its now revolted\r\ncitizens, and the rebellion will subside as suddenly as it broke upon\r\nus. Yet a little while, and ours will again be a land of peace,\r\nreturning joyfully to the pursuits of productive industry and radiant\r\nwith the sunlight of Universal Liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THEY DID IT.\r\n\r\n  The magnates of Richmond all swore out of hand,\r\n  That the war must go in the enemies' land;\r\n  And it did: when they crossed to the Maryland shore\r\n  They turned all into foes who were friendly before!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM MOUNT LAFAYETTE, WHITE MOUNTAINS.\r\n\r\n  Silence and light and scenes stupendous greet\r\n  My wondering sense and sight! Here midway meet\r\n  Those rocky splendors where th' embracing clouds\r\n  Above, below, wrap them in misty shrouds.\r\n\r\n  Our mules with cautious feet the sharp ascent\r\n  Accomplish; and, the steep o'ertopped, all spent\r\n  Our strength, we look wild nature in the face,\r\n  Some features of the human soul to trace.\r\n\r\n  A phantom drap'ry betwixt sky and earth,\r\n  Of blending tints, spans in impulsive birth\r\n  Th' entranced view! A heav'nly arch it forms--\r\n  It seems suspended by some seraph's arms!\r\n\r\n  Ethereal Rainbow! Daughter of the Shower!\r\n  Thy beauty lends enchantment to the hour.\r\n  The seraph arm grows weary--now is furled\r\n  The gleam in dreamy vapor from the world!\r\n\r\n  And now in purple shadows stand the hills:\r\n  The night winds beat their stony sides, and trills\r\n  From hidden rivulets, and stealthy creep\r\n  Of some lone reptile down the grooved steep,\r\n\r\n  Divert the eye and ear--th' restricted breath\r\n  Of each rapt soul is heard--and still as death\r\n  Stand the dumb mules. Homeward we turn our eyes,\r\n  And leave the region of the naked skies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEPENDENCE.\r\n\r\n[1776.]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Freeman! if you pant for glory,\r\n  If you sigh to live in story,\r\n      If you burn with patriot zeal;\r\n  Seize this bright, auspicious hour,\r\n  Chase those venal tools of power,\r\n      Who subvert the public weal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOMESTEAD BILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a severe struggle of more than a quarter of a century, from March,\r\n1836, to May, 1862, the Homestead bill has become a law. We quote its\r\nmain provisions, as follows:\r\n\r\n     'That any person who is the head of a family or arrived at the age\r\n     of twenty-one years, and is a citizen of the United States, or\r\n     shall have filed his declaration of intention to become such, as\r\n     required by the naturalization laws of the United States, and has\r\n     never borne arms against the United States government, or given aid\r\n     and comfort to its enemies, from and after the 1st January, 1863,\r\n     shall be entitled to enter one quarter section or a less quantity\r\n     of unappropriated public land, upon which said person may have\r\n     filed a preëmption claim, or which may at the time the application\r\n     is made be subject to preëmption at $1.25 or less per acre, or\r\n     eighty acres or less of such unappropriated land at $2.50 per acre,\r\n     to be located in a body in conformity to the legal subdivisions of\r\n     the public lands, and after the same shall have been surveyed, &c.\r\n\r\n     'SEC. 2. That the person applying for the benefit of this\r\n     act shall, upon application to the register of the land office in\r\n     which he or she is about to make such entry, make affidavit before\r\n     the said register or receiver that he or she is the head of a\r\n     family, or is twenty-one years of age or more, or shall have\r\n     performed service in the army or navy of the United States, and\r\n     that he has never borne arms against the government of the United\r\n     Stales, or given aid and comfort to its enemies, and that such\r\n     application is made for his or her exclusive use and benefit, and\r\n     that said entry is made for the purpose of actual settlement and\r\n     cultivation, and not either directly or indirectly for the use or\r\n     benefit of any other person or persons whomsoever: and upon filing\r\n     the said affidavit with the register or receiver, and on the\r\n     _payment of ten dollars_, he or she shall thereupon be permitted to\r\n     enter the quantity of land specified,' &c.\r\n\r\nSettlement and cultivation for five years required, when the patent\r\nissues--the land secured in case of the settler's death, to the widow,\r\nchildren, or heirs--the settler must be a citizen of the United States\r\nbefore the patent is given--the land is subject to no debt incurred\r\nbefore the emanation of the patent. As the title remains for five years\r\nin the government, and until the patent issues, the land, in the\r\nmeantime, could scarcely be subject to taxation. The land is\r\nsubstantially a gift, the $10 (£2. 0. 16.) being only sufficient to pay\r\nfor the survey and incidental expenses.\r\n\r\nWhilst natives are included in this act, Europeans already here, or who\r\nmay come hereafter, participate alike in its benefits. The emigrant can\r\nmake the entry and settle upon the land merely on filing the declaration\r\nof intention to become a citizen, and it is only after the lapse of five\r\nyears therefrom, that he must be naturalized.\r\n\r\nThis law should be widely circulated, at home and abroad, and especially\r\nin Ireland and Germany. It should be published in all leading presses,\r\nand distributed in printed circulars. By law, two sections (1,280 acres)\r\nare reserved in each township of six miles square, from the sale of\r\nwhich to establish free schools, where all children can be instructed,\r\nso that our material progress may be accompanied by universal education\r\nand intellectual development.\r\n\r\nThis great domain reserved, as farms and homesteads for the industrious\r\nmasses of Europe and America, is thus described by the Hon. Joseph S.\r\nWilson, in his great historical and statistical report, as commissioner\r\nof the General Land Office of Nov. 29, 1860:\r\n\r\n     'Of the 3,250,000 of square miles which constitute the territorial\r\n     extent of the Union, the public lands embrace an area of 2,265,625\r\n     square miles, or 1,450,000,000 of acres, being more than two thirds\r\n     of our geographical extent, and nearly three times as large as the\r\n     United States at the ratification of the definitive treaty of peace\r\n     in 1783 with Great Britain. This empire domain extends from the\r\n     northern line of Texas, the gulf of Mexico, reaching to the\r\n     Atlantic ocean, northwesterly to the Canada line bordering upon the\r\n     great lakes Erie, Huron, Michigan, and Superior, extending westward\r\n     to the Pacific ocean, with Puget's sound on the north, the\r\n     Mediterranean sea of our extreme northwestern possessions.'\r\n\r\n     'It includes fifteen sovereignties known as the 'Land States,' and\r\n     an extent of territory sufficient for thirty-two additional, each\r\n     equal to the great central land State of Ohio.\r\n\r\n     'It embraces soils capable of abundant yield of the rich\r\n     productions of the tropics, of sugar, cotton, rice, tobacco, corn,\r\n     and the grape, the vintage, now a staple, particularly so of\r\n     California; of the great cereals, wheat and corn, in the western,\r\n     northwestern, and Pacific States, and in that vast interior region\r\n     from the valley of the Mississippi river to the Rocky mountains;\r\n     and thence to the chain formed by the Sierra Nevada and Cascades,\r\n     the eastern wall of the Pacific slope, every variety of soil is\r\n     found revealing its wealth.\r\n\r\n     'Instead of dreary inarable wastes, as supposed in earlier times,\r\n     the millions of buffalo, elk, deer, mountain sheep, the primitive\r\n     inhabitants of the soil, fed by the hand of nature, attest its\r\n     capacity for the abundant support of a dense population through the\r\n     skilful toil of the agriculturist, dealing with the earth under the\r\n     guidance of the science of the present age.\r\n\r\n     'Not only is the yield of food for man in this region abundant, but\r\n     it holds in its bosom the precious metals of gold, silver, with\r\n     cinnabar, the useful metals of iron, lead, copper, interspersed\r\n     with immense belts or strata of that propulsive element coal, the\r\n     source of riches and power, and now the indispensable agent not\r\n     only for domestic purposes of life, but in the machine shop, the\r\n     steam car, and steam vessel, quickening the advance of civilization\r\n     and the permanent settlement of the country, and being the agent of\r\n     active and constant intercommunication with every part of the\r\n     republic.'\r\n\r\nKansas having been admitted since the date of this report, our public\r\ndomain, thus described officially, now includes the sixteen _land\r\nStates_, and _all_ the Territories.\r\n\r\nOf this vast region (originally 1,450,000,000 acres), there was surveyed\r\nup to September, 1860, 441,067,915 acres, and 394,088,712 acres disposed\r\nof by sales, grants, &c., leaving, as the commissioner states,'the total\r\narea of unsold and unappropriated, of offered and unoffered lands of the\r\npublic domain on the 30th September, 1860, 1,055,911,288 acres.' This is\r\n'land surface,' exclusive of lakes, bays, rivers, &c., 1,055,911,288\r\nacres, or 1,649,861 square miles, and exceeds one half the area of the\r\nwhole Union. The area of New York being 47,000 square miles, is less\r\nthan a thirty-fifth part of our public domain. England (proper) has\r\n50,922 square miles, France 203,736, Prussia 107,921, and Germany 80,620\r\nsquare miles: The area then of our public domain is more than eight\r\ntimes as large as France, more than fifteen times as large as Prussia,\r\nmore than twenty times as large as Germany, more than thirty-two times\r\nas large as England, and larger (excluding Russia) than all Europe,\r\ncontaining more than 200 millions of people.\r\n\r\nAs England (proper) contained in 1861, 18,949,916 inhabitants, if our\r\npublic domain were as densely settled, its population would exceed 606\r\nmillions, and it would be 260,497,561, if numbering as many to the\r\nsquare mile as Massachusetts. But if, contrary to the opinion before\r\nquoted of the commissioner, one fourth of this domain was unfit for\r\nagriculture, grazing, mining, commerce, or manufactures, the remainder\r\nwould still contain 195,373,171 inhabitants (if as densely settled as\r\nMassachusetts), and with every variety of soil, climate, mineral and\r\nagricultural products. Its average fertility far exceeds that of Europe,\r\nas does also the extent of its mines, especially gold, silver, coal, and\r\niron.\r\n\r\nThese lands are surveyed at the expense of the government into\r\ntown-ships of six miles square, subdivided into sections, and these into\r\nquarter sections (160 acres), set apart for homesteads. Our system of\r\npublic surveys into squares, by lines running due north and south, east\r\nand west, is so simple as to have precluded all disputes as to boundary\r\nor title. This domain reaches from the 24th to the 49th parallel, from\r\nthe lakes to the gulf, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific. Its\r\nisothermes (the lines of equal mean annual temperature) strike on the\r\nnorth the coast of Norway midway, touch St. Petersburg in Russia, and\r\npass through Manchooria to the coast of Asia, about three degrees south\r\nof the mouth of the Amour river. On the south, these isothermes run\r\nthrough northern Africa, and nearly the centre of Egypt near Thebes,\r\ncross northern Arabia, Persia, northern Hindostan, and southern China\r\nnear Canton. No empire in the world of contiguous territory possesses\r\nsuch a variety of climate, soil, forests, and prairies, fruits, and\r\nfisheries, animal, vegetable, mineral, and agricultural products. It has\r\nall those of Europe, and many in addition, with a climate, as shown by\r\nthe international census, far more salubrious, with a more genial sun,\r\nand millions in other countries are already fed and clothed by our\r\nsurplus products.\r\n\r\nOf this vast domain, less than two per cent. is cursed by slavery, which\r\nis prohibited by law in ten of these land States, and in all the\r\nTerritories. Indeed, when the present rebellion shall be crushed, and\r\nthis vast territorial region (accelerated by the Homestead bill) shall\r\nbe settled and admitted as States, three fourths of the States will then\r\nbe free States, and thus authorized by the Constitution to amend that\r\ninstrument. Thus we can by just and lawful measures make emancipation\r\nuniversal. From the progress of events, we shall probably celebrate the\r\n4th of July, 1876, our first centennial, now less than fourteen years\r\ndistant, as a nation, of _freemen_, with slavery abolished or rapidly\r\ndisappearing. State will then have succeeded State in unbroken column,\r\nfrom the Atlantic to the Pacific, united by imperial railroads\r\ntraversing the continent. Adjacent regions, geographically connected\r\nwith us, will then consummate the political union designed by\r\nProvidence, The Homestead bill, having accomplished its great work\r\nwithin our present limits, will then commence a new career, and carry\r\nour banner in peaceful triumph, over the continent. Our Review, then, is\r\ncalled CONTINENTAL, as prefiguring the destiny of our country.\r\n\r\nNow, however, within our present vast domain, not only the poor, but our\r\nown industrious classes and those of Europe may not only find a home,\r\nbut a farm for each settler, substantially as a free gift by the\r\ngovernment. Here all who would rather be owners than tenants, and wish\r\nto improve and cultivate their own soil, are invited. Here, too, all who\r\nwould become equals among equals, citizens (not subjects) of a great and\r\nfree country, enjoying the right of suffrage, and eligible to every\r\noffice except the presidency, can come and occupy with us this great\r\ninheritance. Here liberty, equality, and fraternity reign supreme, not\r\nin theory or in name only, but in truth and reality. This is the\r\nbrotherhood of man, secured and protected by our organic law. Here the\r\nConstitution and the people are the only sovereigns, and the government\r\nis administered by their elected agents, and for the benefit of the\r\npeople. Those toiling elsewhere for wages that will scarcely support\r\nexistence, for the education of whose children no provision is made by\r\nlaw, who are excluded from the right of suffrage, may come here and be\r\nvoters and citizens, find a farm given as a homestead, free schools\r\nprovided for their children at the public expense, and hold any office\r\nbut the presidency, to which their children, born here, are eligible.\r\nWhat does England for any one of its toiling millions who rejects this\r\nmunificent offer? He is worked and taxed there to his utmost endurance,\r\nor pressed into military service. He has the right to _work_, to\r\n_fight_, and _pay taxes_, but not to vote. Unschooled ignorance is his\r\nlot and that of his descendants. If a farmer, he works and improves the\r\nland of others, in constant terror of rent day, the landlord, and\r\neviction. Indeed, the annual rent of a single acre in England exceeds\r\nthe price--$10 (£2. 0. 16)--payable for the ownership in fee simple of\r\nthe entire homestead of 160 acres, granted him here by the government.\r\nFor centuries that are past, and for all time to come, there, severe\r\ntoil, poverty, ignorance, the workhouse, or low wages, impressment, and\r\ndisfranchisement, would seem to be his lot. Here, freedom, competence,\r\nthe right of suffrage, the homestead farm, and free schools for his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIn selecting these homestead farms, the emigrant can have any\r\ntemperature, from St. Petersburg to Canton. He can have a cold, a\r\ntemperate, or a warm climate, and farming or gardening, grazing or\r\nvintage, varied by fishing or hunting. He can raise wheat, rye, Indian\r\ncorn, oats, rice, indigo, cotton, tobacco, cane or maple sugar and\r\nmolasses, sorghum, wool, peas and beans, Irish or sweet potatoes,\r\nbarley, buckwheat, wine, butter, cheese, hay, clover, and all the\r\ngrasses, hemp, hops, flax and flaxseed, silk, beeswax and honey, and\r\npoultry, in uncounted abundance. If he prefers a stock farm, he can\r\nraise horses, asses, and mules, camels, milch cows, working oxen and\r\nother cattle, goats, sheep, and swine. In many locations, these will\r\nrequire neither housing nor feeding throughout the year. He can have\r\norchards, and all the fruits and vegetables of Europe, and many in\r\naddition. He can have an Irish or German, Scotch, English, or Welsh,\r\nFrench, Swiss, Norwegian, or American neighborhood. He can select the\r\nshores of oceans, lakes, or rivers; live on tide water or higher lands,\r\nvalleys or mountains. He can be near a church of his own denomination;\r\nthe freedom of conscience is complete; he pays no tithes, nor church\r\ntax, except voluntarily. His sons and daughters, on reaching twenty-one\r\nyears of age, or sooner, if the head of a family, or having served in\r\nthe army, are each entitled to a homestead of 160 acres; and if he dies,\r\nthe title is secured to his widow, children, or heirs. Our flag is his,\r\nand covers him everywhere with its protection. He is our brother, and he\r\nand his children will enjoy with us the same heritage of competence and\r\nfreedom. He comes where labor is king, and toil is respected and\r\nrewarded. If before, or instead of receiving his homestead, he chooses\r\nto pursue his profession, or business, to work at his trade, or for\r\ndaily wages, he will find them double the European rate, and subsistence\r\ncheaper. From whatever part of Europe he may come, he will meet his\r\ncountrymen here, and from them and us receive a cordial welcome. A\r\ngovernment which gives him a farm, the right to vote, and free schools\r\nfor his children, must desire his welfare. And well has this been\r\nmerited by our immigrants, for, side by side with our native sons, have\r\nthey ever upheld our banner with devoted courage.\r\n\r\nOf all the epidemic insanities which occasionally afflict nations, none\r\nexceeded in folly the recent frenzy, which, by diminishing immigration,\r\nwould have retarded our progress in wealth, power, and population,\r\nNearly all our railroads and canals have been constructed mainly by\r\nimmigrants, thus rapidly improving our whole country, and furnishing\r\nprofitable business, employment, and augmented wages in all the pursuits\r\nof industry. Simultaneously with the homestead, Congress has provided\r\nthe means for constructing the imperial railway which will soon unite\r\nthe Atlantic with the Pacific. Passing, as it will, for several thousand\r\nmiles, through our public domain, it will add much to the value of the\r\nhomestead lands. It should be remembered, especially by the Irish and\r\nGermans, who are asked in the South to fight the rebel battles, that,\r\nbut for the opposition of Mr. Calhoun and the secession leaders, this\r\nbill would long since have been a law.\r\n\r\nIt was first proposed by Robert J. Walker, in October, 1830, and again,\r\nin a speech made by him against nullification and secession, at Natchez,\r\nMississippi, on the first Monday of January, 1833, and then published in\r\nthe _Mississippi Journal_. From that speech we make the following\r\nextract: 'The public lands are now unincumbered by the public debt: no\r\nmore sales are necessary, unless (to settlers) at a price required to\r\npay the expenses of survey and sale. This is the period for the new\r\nStates to produce this beneficial change in the policy of the\r\nGovernment, (instead of) the present onerous system, which arrests the\r\ncultivation of our soil, and growth of our country.' Here the Homestead\r\nbill was recommended by a _Union_ man, in a speech against secession;\r\nand as the opponent of that heresy, he was elected to the United States\r\nSenate by Mississippi, on the 8th of January, 1836.\r\n\r\nIn the United States Senate Journal, of 31st March, 1836, will be found\r\nthe following entry: 'Agreeable to notice, Mr. Walker asked and obtained\r\nleave to bring in a bill to reduce and graduate the price of the public\r\nlands in favor of actual settlers only, to provide a standing preëmption\r\nlaw, to authorize the sale and entry of all the public lands in forty\r\nacre lots, &c. On motion by Mr. Calhoun, that this bill be referred to\r\nthe Committee on Public Lands, ayes 19, nays 25. On motion by Mr.\r\nWalker, ordered that this bill be referred to a select committee of\r\nfive, to be appointed by the Vice-President. Mr. Walker (chairman),\r\nEwing of Ohio, Linn, Prentiss and Ewing of Illinois, are appointed the\r\ncommittee.' And now, that we may understand the motive of the hostile\r\nmotion made by Mr. Calhoun, I make the following extract from Gales &\r\nBeaton's _Congressional Register_, vol. xii., part 1, page 1027, March\r\n31, 1836, containing the debate, on this bill: 'Mr. Walker asked and\r\nobtained leave to introduce a bill to reduce and graduate the price of\r\npublic lands to actual settlers only, &c. The bill having been read\r\ntwice, Mr. Walker moved that it be referred to a committee of five. Mr.\r\nCalhoun opposed the bill, and moved a reference to the Committee on\r\nPublic Lands. Mr. Walker rose and said:\r\n\r\n* * 'He had heard with regret the actual settlers denounced in the\r\nSenate as squatters, as if that were a term of reproach. Our glorious\r\nAnglo-Saxon ancestry, the pilgrims who landed on Plymouth rock, the\r\nearly settlers at Jamestown, were squatters. They settled this continent\r\nwith less pretension to title than the settlers on the public lands.\r\nDaniel Boone was a squatter; Christopher Columbus was a squatter.\r\n\r\n* * They are the men who cultivate the soil in peace, and defend your\r\ncountry in war, when those who denounce them are reposing upon beds of\r\ndown. These are the men who, in the trackless wilderness and upon the\r\nplains of Orleans, carried forward to victory, the bannered eagle of our\r\ngreat and glorious Union. These are the men with whom the patriot\r\nJackson achieved his great and glorious victories; and if but one\r\nthousand of these much abused squatters, these Western riflemen, had\r\nbeen at Bladensburg beneath their great commander, never would a British\r\narmy have polluted the soil where stands the capitol of the Union. They\r\nwould have driven back the invader ere the torch of the incendiary had\r\nreached the capitol, or they would have left their bones bleaching there\r\n(as did the Spartans at Thermopylæ), alike, in death or victory, the\r\npatriot defenders of their country's soil, and fame, and honor. [Here\r\nMr. Walker was interrupted by warm applause from the crowded galleries.]\r\nIt is proposed to send this bill to the Committee on Public Lands, that\r\nhas already reported against reducing the price of the public lands,\r\nagainst granting preemptions to settlers, against every other material\r\nfeature of this bill--to send this bill there, to have another report\r\nagainst us. No, said Mr. Walker; we have had one report against the new\r\nStates, and the settlers in them, and now let them be heard through the\r\nreport of a select committee: let argument encounter argument, and the\r\nquestion be decided on its real merits.'\r\n\r\nThe opposition of Mr. Calhoun to this measure, was based upon the idea,\r\n_originating with him_, that, selling the public lands, only in small\r\ntracts, and at reduced prices, exclusively to actual settlers, would be\r\nhostile to large plantations, prevent the transfer of slavery to new\r\nTerritories, and the multiplication of slave States. This view was\r\ngradually adopted by nearly all the advocates of secession, and delayed\r\nfor years the success of the homestead policy. The measure also\r\nencountered then serious opposition from the supporters of the bill\r\n(opposed by Mr. Calhoun), distributing among the States the proceeds of\r\nthe sales of the public lands. A majority of the Committee of Public\r\nLands of the Senate favored then the distribution policy, and therefore\r\nMr. Calhoun's motion to refer the Homestead bill to that committee was\r\ndesigned to defeat the measure.\r\n\r\nMr. Walker's bill granted a homestead of a quarter section to every\r\nsettler on payment of twenty dollars, _after_ three years' occupancy and\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nThe special committee, to which this bill was referred, would not go so\r\nfar, but authorized Mr. Walker to report 'A bill to arrest monopolies of\r\nthe public lands and purchases thereof for speculation, and substitute\r\nsales to actual settlers only, in limited quantities, and at reduced\r\nprices,' &c. This report will be found in vol. 5, Sen. Doc., 1st\r\nsession, 24th Congress, No. 402. 'In Senate of the United States, June\r\n15, 1836, Mr. Walker made the following report:'\r\n\r\n_Extracts._--'The committee have adopted the principle that the public\r\nlands should be held as a sacred reserve for the _cultivators of the\r\nsoil_; that monopolies by individuals or companies should be prevented;\r\nthat sales should be made only in limited quantities to _actual\r\nsettlers_, and the price in their favor reduced and graduated.' * * The\r\nold system 'is throwing the public domain into the hands of speculating\r\nmonopolists. It is reviving many of the evils of the old feudal system\r\nof Europe. Under that system, the lands were owned in vast bodies by a\r\nfew wealthy barons, and leased by them to an impoverished and dependent\r\ntenantry.'\r\n\r\nA bill based on this principle, and reported by Mr. Walker at a\r\nsucceeding session, passed the Senate, but was defeated in the House. In\r\neach of his annual reports as Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Walker\r\nstrongly recommended the homestead policy, which encountered the\r\ncontinual opposition of Mr. Calhoun.\r\n\r\nIn his inaugural address as Governor of Kansas, of the 27th May, 1857,\r\nMr. Walker thus strongly advocated the Homestead policy:\r\n\r\n     'If my will could have prevailed as regards the public lands, as\r\n     indicated in my public career, and especially in the bill presented\r\n     by me, as chairman of the Committee on Public Lands, to the Senate\r\n     of the United States, which passed that body but failed in the\r\n     House, I would authorize no sales of these lands except for\r\n     settlement and cultivation, reserving not merely a preëmption, but\r\n     a HOMESTEAD of a quarter section of land in favor of every\r\n     _actual settler_, whether coming from other States or _emigrating\r\n     from Europe_. Great and populous States would thus be added to the\r\n     Confederacy, until we should soon have one unbroken line of States,\r\n     from the Atlantic to the Pacific, giving immense additional power\r\n     and security to the Union, and facilitating intercourse between all\r\n     its parts. This would be alike beneficial to the old and to the new\r\n     States. To the _working men_ of the old States, as well as of the\r\n     new, it would be of incalculable advantage, not merely by affording\r\n     them a home in the West, but by maintaining the _wages of labor_,\r\n     by enabling the working classes to emigrate and become cultivators\r\n     of the soil, when the rewards of daily toil should sink below a\r\n     fair remuneration. Every new State, beside, adds to the customers\r\n     of the old States, consuming their manufactures, employing their\r\n     merchants, giving business to their vessels and canals, their\r\n     railroads and cities, and a powerful impulse to their industry and\r\n     prosperity. Indeed, it is the growth of the mighty West which has\r\n     added, more than all other causes combined, to the power and\r\n     prosperity of the whole country; whilst, at the same time, through\r\n     the channels of business and commerce, it has been building up\r\n     immense cities in the Eastern Atlantic and Middle States, and\r\n     replenishing the Federal treasury with large payments from the\r\n     settlers upon the public lands, rendered of real value only by\r\n     their labor, and thus, from increased exports, bringing back\r\n     augmented imports, and soon largely increasing the revenue of the\r\n     Government from that source also.'--_See Doc. Vol. I., No. 8, 1st\r\n     Sess. XXXVth Congress._\r\n\r\nIt will no doubt be remembered how much this address was denounced by\r\nthe secession leaders, and with what fury Mr. Walker was assailed by\r\nthem for insisting on the rejection of the Lecompton Constitution, by\r\nwhich, it was attempted, by fraud and forgery, to force slavery upon\r\nKansas, against the will of the people.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1860, a Homestead bill was passed by Congress, securing to\r\nactual settlers a quarter section of the public lands, at twenty-five\r\ncents per acre, which was vetoed by Mr. Buchanan. The veto message says:\r\n'The Secretary of the Interior estimated the revenue from the public\r\nlands for the nest fiscal year at $4,000,000, on the presumption that\r\nthe present land system would remain unchanged. Should this bill become\r\na law, he does not believe that $1,000,000 will be derived from this\r\nsource.' It would thus seem that Jacob Thompson, then Secretary of the\r\nInterior, was permitted to dictate the financial portion of this veto.\r\nHe is now in the traitor army; but before leaving the Cabinet, he\r\ncommunicated to the enemy at Charleston important information he had\r\nreceived officially and confidentially. Whilst still Secretary, he was\r\npermitted by Mr. Buchanan to accept from Mississippi, _after_ she had\r\nseceded, the post of her ambassador to North Carolina, to induce her to\r\nsecede; which public mission he openly fulfilled, still remaining a\r\nmember of the Cabinet. Such was the abyss of degradation to which the\r\nlate Administration had then fallen. Indeed, Thompson (like Floyd and\r\nCobb), was never dismissed by Mr. Buchanan, but resigned his office,\r\nreceiving then, after all these treasonable and perfidious acts, a most\r\ncomplimentary letter from the late President.\r\n\r\nMr. Thompson's financial argument against the Homestead bill is most\r\nfallacious. Our national wealth, by the last census, was\r\n$16,159,616,068, and its increase during the last ten years\r\n$8,925,481,011, or 126.45 per cent. Now if, as a consequence of the\r\nHomestead bill, there should be occupied, improved, and cultivated,\r\nduring the next ten years, 50,000 additional farms by settlers, or only\r\n5,000 per annum, it would make an aggregate of 8,000,000 acres. If,\r\nincluding houses, fences, barns, and other improvements, we should value\r\neach of these farms at ten dollars an acre, it would make an aggregate\r\nof $80,000,000. But if we add the products of these farms, allowing only\r\none half of each (80 acres) to be cultivated, and the average annual\r\nvalue of the crops, stock included, to be only ten dollars per acre, it\r\nwould give $40,000,000 a year, and, in ten years, $400,000,000,\r\nindependent of the reinvestment of capital. It is clear that, thus, vast\r\nadditional employment would be given to labor, freight to steamers,\r\nrailroads, and canals, and markets for manufactures.\r\n\r\nThe homestead privilege will largely increase immigration. Now, beside\r\nthe money brought here by immigrants, the census proves that the average\r\nannual value of the labor of Massachusetts _per capita_ was, in 1860,\r\n$220 for each man, woman, and child, independent of the gains of\r\ncommerce--very large, but not given. Assuming that of the immigrants at\r\nan average annual value of only $100 each, or less than 33 cents a day,\r\nit would make, in ten years, at the rate of 100,000 each year, the\r\nfollowing aggregate:\r\n\r\n  1st year  100,000 = $10,000,000\r\n  2d    \"   200,000 \"  20,000,000\r\n  3d    \"   300,000 \"  30,000,000\r\n  4th   \"   400,000 \"  40,000,000\r\n  5th   \"   500,000 \"  50,000,000\r\n  6th   \"   600,000 \"  60,000,000\r\n  7th   \"   700,000 \"  70,000,000\r\n  8th   \"   800,000 \"  80,000,000\r\n  9th   \"   900,000 \"  90,000,000\r\n  10th  \" 1,000,000 \" 100,000,000\r\n                      -----------\r\n      Total,         $550,000,000\r\n\r\nIn this table, the labor of all immigrants each year is properly added\r\nto those arriving the succeeding year, so as to make the aggregate, the\r\nlast year, one million. This would make the value of the labor of this\r\nmillion of immigrants, in ten years, $550,000,000, independent of the\r\nannual accumulation of capital, and the labor of the children of the\r\nimmigrants after the first ten years, which, with their descendants,\r\nwould go on constantly increasing.\r\n\r\nBut, by the actual official returns (see page 14 of Census), the number\r\nof alien immigrants to the United States, from December, 1850, to\r\nDecember, 1860, was 2,598,216, or an annual average of 259,821, say\r\n260,000. The effect, then, of this immigration, on the basis of the last\r\ntable, upon the increase of national wealth, was as follows:\r\n\r\n  1st year    260,000 =   $26,000,000\r\n  2d   \"      520,000 \"    52,000,000\r\n  3d   \"      780,000 \"    78,000,000\r\n  4th  \"    1,040,000 \"   104,000,000\r\n  5th  \"    1,300,000 \"   130,000,000\r\n  6th  \"    1,560,000 \"   156,000,000\r\n  7th  \"    1,820,000 \"   182,000,000\r\n  8th  \"    2,080,000 \"   208,000,000\r\n  9th  \"    2,340,000 \"   234,000,000\r\n  10th  \"   2,600,000 \"   260,000,000\r\n                          ------------\r\n        Total,          $1,430,000,000\r\n\r\nThus the value of the labor of the immigrants from 1850 to 1860, was\r\nfourteen hundred and thirty millions of dollars, making no allowance for\r\nthe accumulation of capital by annual reinvestment, nor for the natural\r\nincrease of population, amounting by the census in ten years to about\r\ntwenty-four per cent. This addition to our wealth by the labor of the\r\nchildren, in the first ten years, would be small; but in the second, and\r\neach succeeding decennium, when we count children and their descendants,\r\nit would be large and constantly augmenting. But the census shows, that\r\nour wealth increases each ten years at the rate of 126.45 per cent. Now\r\nthen, take our increase of wealth in consequence of immigration as\r\nbefore stated, and compound it at the rate of 126.45 per cent, every ten\r\nyears, and the result is largely over three billions of dollars in 1870,\r\nand over seven billions of dollars in 1880, independent of the effect of\r\nany immigration succeeding 1860. If these results are astonishing, we\r\nmust remember that immigration here is augmented population, and that it\r\nis population and labor that create wealth. Capital, indeed, is but the\r\naccumulation of labor. Immigration, then, from 1850 to 1860, added to\r\nour national wealth a sum more than double our whole debt on the first\r\nof July last, and augmenting in a ratio much more rapid than its\r\nincrease, and thus enabling us to bear the war expenses.\r\n\r\nAs the homestead privilege must largely increase immigration, and add\r\nespecially to the cultivation of our soil, it will contribute more than\r\nany other measure to increase our population, wealth, and power, augment\r\nour revenue from duties and taxes, and soon enable us to repeal the tax\r\nbill, or, at least, confine it to a few articles of luxury.\r\n\r\nNor has this immigration merely increased our wealth; but it has filled\r\nour army with brave _volunteer_ soldiers, Irish, Germans, and of other\r\nnationalities, who, side by side with our native sons, are now pouring\r\nout their blood on every battle field in defence of our flag and Union.\r\nThousands of them have suffered in rebel dungeons, where many are still\r\nlanguishing--thousands are wounded, disabled for life, or filling a\r\nsoldier's grave.\r\n\r\nThus has the immigrant proved himself worthy to participate with our\r\nnative sons in the homestead privilege. He fights our battle, and dies,\r\nthat the Union may live.\r\n\r\nCome, then, our European brother, and enjoy with us every privilege of\r\nan American citizen. The altar of freedom is consecrated by the\r\nsacrament of our commingled blood. Countrymen of Lafayette and\r\nMontgomery, of Steuben and DeKalb, of Koscinsko and Pulaski! you are\r\nfighting, like them, in the same great cause, under the same banner, and\r\nfor the same glorious Union, and, like them, you will reap an\r\nimmortality of glory, and the gratitude of our country and of mankind.\r\nAs century shall follow century, in marking this crisis of human\r\ndestiny, history will record the stupendous fact, that the blood of all\r\nEurope commingled freely with our own in the mighty contest, the pledges\r\nof the freedom and brotherhood of man!\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Homestead bill was of Union origin, opposed by Mr.\r\nCalhoun and the pro-slavery party. We have seen that the bill was vetoed\r\nby Mr. Buchanan, quoting the opposing argument of a traitor member of\r\nhis Cabinet, now in the rebel army. The vote in the Senate after the\r\nveto, was, yeas 28 (not two thirds), and nays 18. (Sen. Journal, 757,\r\nJune 23, 1860.) Of the yeas, all but three were from the free States;\r\nand of the nays, _all_ were from the slave States. The opposition, then,\r\nas foreshadowed by Mr. Calhoun in 1836, was _exclusively sectional_ and\r\npro-slavery. As Mr. Buchanan changed his policy as to Kansas upon the\r\nthreats of the secession leaders in 1857, so he sacrificed upon their\r\nmandate the Homestead bill in 1860.\r\n\r\nMost of the eighteen Southern Senators who voted against this bill, are\r\nnow in the rebel service. Among these eighteen nays, are Jefferson\r\nDavis, Bragg, Mason, Hunter, Mallory, Chesnut, Yulee, Wigfall,\r\nFitzpatrick, Iveson, Johnson of Arkansas, Hemphill, and Sebastian. Now,\r\nthen, when Irish and Germans in the South are asked to fight for the\r\npro-slavery rebellion, let them remember that the secession leaders\r\nvoted unanimously against the homestead bill, whilst the North then gave\r\nits entire vote in, favor of the measure, and have now made it the law\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nAs it is a blessed thing for the poor and landless to receive,\r\nsubstantially as a gift, a farm from the Government, where they and\r\ntheir children may till their own soil, and enjoy competence, freedom,\r\nand free schools, let them never forget, that this was the act of the\r\nNorth, and opposed by the South. If the rebels succeed, they will hold\r\nthe public domain in their States and Territories for large plantations,\r\nto be cultivated by slaves, and sink their 'poor whites,' as nearly as\r\npracticable, to the level of their slaves, in accordance with their\r\ntheory, that capital should own labor.\r\n\r\nTexas, is very nearly six times as large as New York, and more than one\r\nhalf the area is public domain of the State, with a most salubrious\r\nclimate, with all the products of the North and South, as shown by the\r\ncensus, and with three times as many cattle (2,733,267) as in any other\r\nState. This vast domain, if the South succeeds, will be cultivated in\r\nlarge tracts by slaves; but with our success, the State title will be\r\nforfeited to the Government, and the land colonized by loyal freemen,\r\nand subjected to the Homestead law, so that educated free white labor\r\ncan raise there sugar, cotton, rice, tobacco, and indigo, as well as the\r\ncrops of the North. It appears by the history of the reign of Henry II.,\r\nthat Ireland (in the year 1102) was the _first country which abolished\r\nslavery_, England still retaining it for many centuries; and Germany\r\nscarcely participated in the African slave trade. And now those two\r\nbrave and mighty races, the Celtic and Teutonic, so devoted to liberty\r\nand the rights of man, will never erect the temple of their faith upon\r\nthe Confederate _corner stone_, the ownership, of man by man, and of\r\nlabor by capital. No--they are fighting in the great cause, (now,\r\nhenceforth, and forever inseparable,) of LIBERTY and UNION. And when, as\r\nthe result of this rebellion, slavery shall disappear from our country,\r\nthe words of the Sermon on the Mount, announcing the brotherhood of man,\r\nand adopted by our fathers in the Declaration of American Independence,\r\nmay be inscribed on our banner, 'that _all men_ are created EQUAL; that\r\nthey are endowed by their CREATOR with _inalienable_ RIGHTS; that among\r\nthese are life, LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness.' Such was the\r\nfaith plighted to God, our country, and humanity, on the day of the\r\nnation's birth; in crushing this rebellion, and inaugurating the reign\r\nof universal freedom, we are now fulfilling that pledge. Slavery having\r\nstruck down our flag, having dissevered our States, having, with\r\nsacrilegious steps, entered our holy temples, separated churches, and\r\nerected a government based on dehumanizing man, under the _Union as it\r\nwas_: liberty will reunite us by fraternal and indissoluble ties, under\r\nthe UNION AS IT WILL BE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES\r\n\r\n\r\n     THE PATIENCE OF HOPE. By the Author of A PRESENT\r\n     HEAVEN. With an Introduction by JOHN G. WHITTIER,\r\n     '_Et teneo et teneor._' Boston: Ticknor & Fields.\r\n\r\nA work less remarkable for talent than for tender, pious feeling--less\r\nmarked by genius than goodness, yet of a kind which the impartial critic\r\nwill still sincerely commend, simply because its defects are negative\r\nwhile its merits are positive and apparent to all who will read only a\r\nfew pages in it. The author seems to us as one who has gleaned the best\r\nfrom mystical Christianity or Quietism, without having taken up its\r\ndefects--one who has found in TAULER or GUYON, or perhaps still more in\r\nFÉNÉLON, something to love, and has loved it without effort. We are\r\ncertain that the work is one which will enjoy a very extensive\r\npopularity among all liberal-minded yet truly devout Christians.\r\n\r\n     HISTORY OF FRIEDRICH THE SECOND, CALLED FREDERICK THE\r\n     GREAT. By THOMAS CARLYLE. In four volumes. Vol. III.\r\n     New York: Harper & Brothers. Boston: A.K. Loring. 1862.\r\n\r\nTo judge CARLYLE well, one should have outgrown a love for him. Then,\r\nand not till then, will the reader ace him as he is--a genius obscured\r\nand belittled by eccentricity in judgment and grotesqueness in literary\r\nart; a man who must be seen, out of whom much may be taken, but not with\r\nprofit unless we leave much behind; a writer who was ahead of his age in\r\n1830, but who is wellnigh thirty years behind it now; one still\r\nworshipping heroes, and quite ignorant that great ideas are taking for\r\nthe world the place of great men. It is curious to consider that\r\nCARLYLE, without understanding the first principles of the French\r\nRevolution, should have written most readably on it, and that, still\r\nmore blind to the manifest path of free labor and of utility, he should\r\nstill have assumed a pseudo-radical position. Yet, after all, nothing is\r\nstrange when a man is wrong in his premises. Carp at them as he may,\r\nCARLYLE is of the destructives rather than the builders, and, like all\r\nliterary destructives, continually flies for shelter to the\r\nconservatives, even as Rabelais fled for safety to the Pope.\r\n\r\nIn this third volume of Friedrich the Second, he who neither overrates\r\nnor underrates CARLYLE may read with great profit. In it one\r\nsees, as in a brilliant series of highly-colored views--overcolored very\r\noften--shifting with strange rapidity and in wild lights, how from June,\r\n1740, to August, 1744, King Frederick lived his own life, and\r\nincidentally that of Prussia and a good part of the civilized world with\r\nit, as all active and earnest monarchs are wont to do. That it is\r\npiquant and interesting--to the well-educated taste more so than any\r\nnovel--is true enough; and if the author acts despotically and talks\r\narbitrarily, we may smile, and leave him to settle it with his dead men.\r\nHe must be dumb indeed who can read it and not feel his thinking powers\r\ngreatly stimulated, and with it, if he be a writer, his faculty of\r\ncreating.\r\n\r\n     JENKINS'S VEST-POCKET LEXICON. BY JABEZ JENKINS.\r\n     Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co. Boston: A.K. Loring. 1862.\r\n\r\nA dictionary is generally referred to for unfamiliar--not for well-known\r\nwords; but it is in large and copious ones only that such words are\r\ngiven, and every one has not always at hand his WEBSTER and WORCESTER\r\n'unabridged.' In view of this want, JABEZ JENKINS has compiled an\r\nadmirable little two-and-a-half-inch square English 'Lexicon of all\r\n_except_ familiar words, including the principal scientific and\r\ntechnical terms, and foreign moneys, weights, and measures.' The common\r\nLatin and French phrases of two and three words, and the principal names\r\nof classical mythology, are also given; 'omitting,' says J.J., 'what\r\neverybody knows, and containing what everybody wants to know, and\r\ncannot readily find.' It would be difficult to exaggerate the great\r\npractical utility of this admirable little book, in which, we have, so\r\nto speak, the very quintessence of a dictionary given _in poco_. We\r\nshould not have looked for a joke, however, in an abridged\r\ndictionary--but there is one. 'This Lexicon,' says its author, 'will be\r\nfound a convenient, and, it is hoped, a valuable _vade mecum_; and,\r\nthough not inspiring the same degree of _veneration_ as some of its\r\nleviathan contemporaries, may possibly occupy a place much nearer the\r\nheart, viz., in the heart-pocket.' Let us not forget, by the way, to\r\nmention that S. AUSTIN ALLIBONE has indorsed this little work as one of\r\nthe most important and useful publications of the day.\r\n\r\n     INSIDE OUT. A Curious Book by a Singular Man. New York:\r\n     Miller, Mathews & Clasback, 767 Broadway. Boston; A.K. Loring.\r\n\r\nThe first instalment of the promised oddity of this work occurs in the\r\nfirst page--in fact, several pages before it--in the assertion that\r\n'this work is respectfully dedicated to the first young lady who can\r\ntruthfully assert that she has read from title page to colophon WITHOUT\r\nSKIPPING. Such is the determination of the author.'\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the determined author has hit upon a\r\ntolerably effectual means of securing a few lady readers. As for the\r\nwork itself, it is, with more eccentricity of thought and less\r\nfamiliarity with composition than we should anticipate in a bad one. It\r\nis bold, rather sensational, involving a high-pressure murder and the\r\nsomewhat _connu_ father-in-difficulties with a daughter, but\r\ninteresting, and on the whole likely enough--in New York, where any\r\namount of anything may be supposed to take place at any time without in\r\nthe slightest degree violating the conditions of probability. For his\r\n_bete noir_ or grand villain, the Singular Man seems to have studied\r\nvery carefully the gentleman who is said to have _poséd_ for\r\n'DENS-DEATH' in 'Cecil Dreeme,' and has to our mind approached\r\nhim more closely even than WINTHROP has done. Among the\r\ncharacters one--'Charles Tewphunny'--strikes us as a reality; a\r\nvigorous, earnest, cheerful nature, clear and fine even through the\r\nobscurity and occasional crudity of his word-painter. We like\r\nCharles--_he_ should have been the favored one by love, as he is in\r\nbeing the true hero of the tale.\r\n\r\nThe work is in fact crude, as though hastily written and had not been at\r\nall reviewed--at least by an experienced writer. On the other hand, its\r\nauthor is evidently a gentleman, one widely familiar with life--even a\r\ntown life in many details--and is most unmistakably a scholar of rare\r\nripeness. So manifest is his ability, and so remarkable the varied\r\nlearning and experience which gleam (unknown to the author himself)\r\nthrough many unconscious allusions, that we wonder at finding such\r\npeculiar gifts turned to illustrate a tale, above all one so carelessly\r\nconstructed as this is. We find fault with the names: 'Malfaire,'\r\n'Tewphunny,' 'Mrs. Kairfull,' are not well devised; and yet again we at\r\nonce regret all harsher judgment in some truly human, refined, and\r\ndelicate passage, which is as creditable to the author's taste as heart.\r\nTaking it altogether, 'Inside Out' is, according to promise, a very\r\ncurious book indeed. In justice to the publishers, we must say a word in\r\nfavor of its neat binding and very attractive typography.\r\n\r\n     COUNTRY LIVING AND COUNTRY THINKING. By GAIL\r\n     HAMILTON. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1862.\r\n\r\nThe Essay, after long years of sleep, has sprung up of late to, at\r\nleast, popularity, and from the pens of the Country Parson and his\r\ndisciples has sent word-pictures and personal experiences well through\r\nthe country. Among the most promising of the American members of the\r\n'Parson's' flock is GAIL HAMILTON, a lively, well-writing,\r\nintensely-Yankee woman; that is to say, a bird who would fly far and\r\nfast indeed were she not well bound down by Puritanical chains, and who,\r\nin default of other experience-means of expression, clinks her fetters\r\nin measures which are merry enough for the many, albeit somewhat\r\nsorrowful at times to those who feel how much more she might have done\r\nunder more genial influences and in a freer field. We could also wish a\r\nlittle less of the endless I and Me and Mine of the Essays, and wonder\r\nif the author will never tire of her intense self-setting forth. But\r\nthis is the constant fault of the personal essay, let who will write it;\r\nand since it has great names to sanction it, we may perhaps let it\r\npass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe President's Proclamation is based mainly on the act of Congress to\r\nwhich he refers. That act was passed with great approach to unanimity\r\namong unconditional Unionists, and met their approbation throughout the\r\ncountry. That the rebel States, as a military question, must be deprived\r\nof the 'sinews of war,' which, with them, are the _sinews of slaves_, is\r\nquite certain. They have boasted, as well before as since the rebellion,\r\nthat their great strength in war consisted in their ability to send all\r\nthe whites to battle, whilst the slaves were retained at home to\r\ncultivate the lands and provide subsistence for armies. Take from the\r\nSouth its slaves, and the necessary supplies must cease for want of\r\nlaborers in the field, or the whites must be withdrawn from the armies\r\nto raise provisions. In either event, the rebellion must terminate in\r\ndefeat. There are thousands then, who, under ordinary circumstances,\r\nwould oppose emancipation, yet who will support this measure as a\r\n_military necessity_. As regards the Border States, the President still\r\nadheres to his original programme: emancipation with their consent,\r\ncompensation by Congress, and colonization beyond our limits.\r\n\r\nAs regards the seceded States, the proclamation only applies to such of\r\nthem as shall persist in rebellion after the first of January next, and\r\neven in those States compensation for their slaves is to be made to all\r\nwho are loyal.\r\n\r\nThe friends of Secession in Europe, and especially in France and\r\nEngland, have contended that slavery was not the cause of the rebellion,\r\nand it has been suggested that the rebels would themselves adopt a\r\nsystem of gradual emancipation. Even now it is alleged that if MR.\r\nLINCOLN had not issued this proclamation, we should have had\r\nsomething very similar from JEFFERSON DAVIS.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, these professions of the friends of the South in\r\nEurope, and particularly of their friends in France and England, will\r\nsoon be tested.\r\n\r\nIf the South objects to emancipation, and denounces this proclamation,\r\nthey will make this contest, on their part, still more clearly a war for\r\nthe maintenance, perpetuity, and unlimited extension of slavery.\r\n\r\nIf, under such circumstances, England continues to support the\r\nrebellion, she must do so as the open and avowed advocate of slavery.\r\nWhat is to be done with the slaves when they are emancipated? is a grave\r\nquestion, which we shall discuss at a future period. There can be little\r\ndoubt, however, that emancipation, on a scale so extensive, would give a\r\ngreat impulse to the cause of colonization.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, three classes of States in which this proclamation\r\nwill have no effect on the 1st of January next:\r\n\r\n  1st. The Border States.\r\n\r\n  2d. Such of the rebel States, and such\r\n  parts of them, as shall return to their allegiance\r\n  before that date.\r\n\r\n  3d. Such of the rebel States, and such\r\n  parts of them, as shall not then have been\r\n  conquered.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time there may be rebel States, or portions of them, where\r\nthe apprehended loss of their slaves, as a consequence of persisting in\r\nthe rebellion, may induce a return to the Union, and thus hasten a\r\nsuccessful conclusion of the war.\r\n\r\nHow far this proclamation, merely as such, would avail to change the\r\nstatus of slaves in such seceded States as may not be occupied by us and\r\nconquered before the first of January next, may be more appropriately\r\ndiscussed when, if ever, such a contingency shall happen.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, whatever may be the effect of this proclamation upon\r\nthe institution of slavery, which was the cause of the war, let us all\r\nunite in its vigorous prosecution, and in carrying, promptly and\r\ntriumphantly, the flag of the Union throughout every State, from\r\nRichmond and Charleston to Mobile and Savannah. Our next campaign must\r\nwitness the final overthrow of the rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REBEL NUMBERS.\r\n\r\nThe whole number of males in the rebel States, by the census of 1860,\r\nbetween 15 and 60 years of age (excepting East Tennessee and Western\r\nVirginia), is less than one million; of whom, from physical disability,\r\nsickness, alienage, &c., at least 100,000 are not available. Of the\r\nremaining 900,000, at least 200,000 have been withdrawn by death,\r\nwounds, sickness, parole, capture, &c., reducing the number to 700,000;\r\nof whom, for indispensable pursuits, at least one third must remain at\r\nhome, reducing their present maximum forces to 466,000. Now, if these\r\ndisappear no more rapidly in the future than in the past (although the\r\nwar will be prosecuted with much more vigor), their numbers would be\r\ndiminished at the rate of at least 12,000 a month. Therefore, as there\r\nare no means of obtaining new recruits, it is clear that the rebellion\r\nmust soon fail for want of troops to meet our immense armies. It is true\r\nno allowance has been made for recruits from the Border States; but\r\nthese (greatly overestimated) would be more than counter-balanced by the\r\ninability to obtain troops from that large portion of the Rebel States\r\noccupied by our forces, such as all the coast from New Orleans to\r\nNorfolk, nearly all the Mississippi River, and considerable sections of\r\nWest and Middle Tennessee, North Alabama, North Mississippi, and\r\nArkansas. The days of the rebellion, then, are numbered.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSharpsburg is a name which will be long remembered, and is destined to\r\nbe found in many a lay and legend. Among the earliest written\r\ncommemorating it, we have the following, from one whose lyrics are well\r\nknown to our readers:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE POTOMAC AT SHARPSBURG.\r\n\r\nBY H. L. SPENCER.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Once smiling fields stretched far on either side,\r\n    Where bowed to every breeze the ripening grain;\r\n  But now with carnage are those waters dyed,\r\n    And all around are slumbering the slain.\r\n    Patriots and heroes! unto whom in vain\r\n  Ne'er cried the voice of Right,--their names shall be\r\n  Graved on a million hearts, and with just pride\r\n    Shall children say, 'For Truth and Liberty\r\n    Our fathers fought at SHARPSBURG, where they fell--\r\n    They _bravely fought_, as history's pages tell.'\r\n    Not for the fallen toll the funeral bell,--\r\n  _Their_ rest is peaceful--_they_ the goal have won.\r\n    Let the thinned ranks be filled, and let us see\r\n  Complete the glorious work by them begun.\r\n\r\nYes--forward! onward! Let it be complete. _Scripta est_--it is written,\r\nand it will be done. After going so far in the great cause which has\r\nbecome our religion and our life, it were hardly worth while to retreat.\r\nLife and fortune are of small account now in this tremendous opening of\r\nnew truths and new interests. And we are only at the beginning! With\r\nevery new death the cause grows more sacred, and the North more grandly\r\nearnest. 'Hurrah for the faithful dead!'\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMRS. H. BEECHER STOWE AND THE DUCHESS OF SUTHERLAND.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MRS. STOWE:\r\n\r\nYour great work, 'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' will no longer circulate in\r\nEngland. Mr. Mason, the Southern ambassador, has convinced us all that\r\nslavery is a divine institution, that whipping and branding are really\r\ngood for the negro, and education dangerous. Indeed, we dare not educate\r\nour own working classes. We begin to perceive the truth of the _corner\r\nstone_ principle of the Southern Confederacy, that capital should always\r\nown labor, whether white or black. Then we would have no more strikes,\r\nor riots, or claims for higher wages, or for the right of suffrage, and\r\nall would be peace. You see my opinion of slavery has changed; and so\r\nhas that of England in church and state, except the working classes, who\r\nwish to vote, and such pestiferous democrats as Bright and Cobden.\r\n\r\nThis rebellion came just in the right time for us. In a few years more\r\nof your success, we should have been compelled to establish free\r\nschools, give the vote by ballot, and extend the suffrage, until the\r\npeople should rule here, as with you. But now that your rebellion has\r\nproved the failure of republics, we shall yield no more. Slavery, in\r\ndissolving your Union, has accomplished all this for us, and therefore\r\nmust be a good institution. Some one has sent me one Edmund Kirke's\r\nanti-slavery novel, entitled, 'Among the Pines.' Your people seem to\r\nhave gone crazy over it; but it will have no readers here. Is this Kirke\r\na Scotchman? I had a tenant called Kirke, who was evicted for avowing\r\nrepublican opinions. Can this be the same man? I told the Confederate\r\nminister, Mr. Mason, that if some Southron would write a good novel in\r\nfavor of slavery, it would have a great circulation here; and he said he\r\nwould name this in his next despatch to his Government. He has a fine\r\naristocratic air, and could scarcely be descended from the women\r\n(imported and sold as wives for a few pounds of tobacco to the\r\nVirginians) who were the mothers of the F. F. V.'s. But Mr. M. says\r\nslavery will soon build up a splendid nobility in the South.\r\n\r\nJefferson Davis is very popular here, and was lately cheered in Exeter\r\nHall; but Yancey and Wigfall are idolized. Our great favorite in the\r\nNorth is Ex-President Buchanan. When did the head of a Government ever\r\nbefore have the courage to aid a rebellion against it, so gracefully\r\nyielding it the national forts, ships, mints, guns, and arsenals? But\r\nwhat we most admire is his message, in which he proved you have no right\r\nto coerce the South or suppress rebellion. This was a splendid discovery\r\nfor us, as it demonstrated how superior our Government is to yours. If\r\nMr. Buchanan would come here, we would raise him to the peerage, and, in\r\ncommemoration of his two great acts, would give him the double title of\r\nthe Duke of Lecompton and Disunion. Floyd, Cobb, and Thompson should\r\neach be earls. Thompson should be called Earl Arnold, in gratitude for\r\nthe services to us of the celebrated Benedict Arnold.\r\n\r\nI told Mr. M. how much we had condemned his fugitive slave law; but he\r\nconvinced me that it was a most humane and excellent measure. Fugitives\r\nfrom the kindest masters, and ungrateful for all the blessings of\r\nslavery, why should they not be brought back in chains? He reminded me\r\nof Generals Shields, Corcoran, and Meagher, Irishmen commanding Irish\r\ntroops for the North, and said they should be brought back to Ireland\r\nand hung on Emmet's scaffold. You know we keep that scaffold still\r\nstanding, as a terror to Irish rebels, although we admire so much\r\nrebellion in America. Mr. M. spoke also of Sigel, Heintzelman,\r\nRosecrans, Asboth, and expressed his surprise that the Bourbon princes\r\nwould fight side by side with the _mudsills_ of the North.\r\n\r\nIn a few years, Mr. M. said, the South would establish a monarchy, and\r\nthat a son of the Queen should marry a daughter of Jefferson Davis, and\r\nthus unite the two dynasties by kindred ties. It was his opinion that\r\nthe South would limit the right of suffrage to slaveholders, numbering\r\nabout two hundred thousand; that they would have a house of peers, lords\r\ntemporal and spiritual, composed (including bishops) of all who held\r\nover five hundred slaves; but that their Archbishop of _Canting_bury\r\nshould own at least one thousand. He thought the number requisite for\r\nthe peerage would be enlarged after the reopening of the African slave\r\ntrade, which would soon furnish England cheap cotton. His remarks on\r\nthis subject reminded me how large a portion of my fortune was\r\naccumulated, during the last century, by the profits of the African\r\nslave trade. Mr. M. told me the King of Dahomey would furnish the South\r\none hundred thousand slaves a year, for twenty dollars each, and that\r\nEngland should have the profits of the trade as before, and Liverpool\r\nagain be the great slave port. He alluded to the CONTINENTAL\r\nMONTHLY, which he said was an abolition journal, and denounced\r\nKirke, Kimball, Leland, Henry, Greeley, Stanton, and Walker. He was\r\nspecially severe on Walker and Stanton, charging them with the defeat of\r\nthe pro-slavery Lecompton Constitution, and the consequent accession of\r\nKansas and all the Territories to the free States, He said Walker and\r\nStanton had no right to reject the Oxford and McGee returns, although\r\nthey were forged. And now, dear Mrs. Stowe, if you would only change, as\r\nwe all have here, and write, as you only can, a great novel to prove the\r\nbeauties of slavery, its circulation here would be enormous, and we\r\nwould make you a duchess. Adieu until my next.\r\n\r\nP.S.--I have invested all my United States stock in Confederate bonds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe style of the foregoing letter would point to the Duchess of\r\nSutherland as the author, but such a change would be miraculous. Was the\r\ncopy of the letter found in an intercepted despatch from Mr. Mason to\r\nJefferson Davis?\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE\r\n\r\n  CONTINENTAL MONTHLY:\r\n\r\n  EDITORS:\r\n\r\n  HON. ROBERT J. WALKER, CHARLES G. LELAND,\r\n\r\n  HON. FRED. P. STANTON, EDMUND KIRKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe readers of the CONTINENTAL are aware of the important\r\nposition it has assumed, of the influence which it exerts, and of the\r\nbrilliant array of political and literary talent of the highest order\r\nwhich supports it. No publication of the kind has, in this country, so\r\nsuccessfully combined the energy and freedom of the daily newspaper with\r\nthe higher literary tone of the first-class monthly; and it is very\r\ncertain that no magazine has given wider range to its contributors, or\r\npreserved itself so completely from the narrow influences of party or of\r\nfaction. In times like the present, such a journal is either a power in\r\nthe land or it is nothing. That the CONTINENTAL is not the\r\nlatter is abundantly evidenced _by what it has done_--by the reflection\r\nof its counsels in many important public events, and in the character\r\nand power of those who are its staunchest supporters.\r\n\r\nBy the accession of HON. ROBERT J. WALKER and HON. F. P.\r\nSTANTON to its editorial corps, the CONTINENTAL acquires a\r\nstrength and a political significance which, to those who are aware of\r\nthe ability and experience of these gentlemen, must elevate it to a\r\nposition far above any previously occupied by any publication of the\r\nkind in America. Preserving all \"the boldness, vigor, and ability\" which\r\na thousand journals have attributed to it, it will at once greatly\r\nenlarge its circle of action, and discuss, fearlessly and frankly, every\r\nprinciple involved in the great questions of the day. The first minds of\r\nthe country, embracing men most familiar with its diplomacy and most\r\ndistinguished for ability, are to become its contributors; and it is no\r\nmere \"flattering promise of a prospectus\" to say, that this \"magazine\r\nfor the times\" will employ the first intellect in America, under\r\nauspices which no publication ever enjoyed before in this country.\r\n\r\nCHARLES GODFREY LELAND, the accomplished scholar and author, who has\r\ntill now been the sole Editor of the Magazine, will, beside his\r\neditorial labors, continue his brilliant contributions to its pages; and\r\nEDMUND KIRKE, author of \"AMONG THE PINES,\" will contribute to each\r\nissue, having already begun a work on Southern Life and Society, which\r\nwill be found far more widely descriptive, and, in all respects,\r\nsuperior to the first.\r\n\r\nWhile the CONTINENTAL will express decided opinions on the\r\ngreat questions of the day, it will not be a mere political journal:\r\nmuch the larger portion of its columns will be enlivened, as heretofore,\r\nby tales, poetry, and humor. In a word, the CONTINENTAL will be\r\nfound, under its new staff of Editors, occupying a position, and\r\npresenting attractions never before found in a magazine.\r\n\r\nTERMS TO CLUBS.\r\n\r\n  Two copies for one year,        Five dollars.\r\n  Three copies for one year,      Six dollars.\r\n  Six copies for one year,        Eleven dollars.\r\n  Eleven copies for one year,     Twenty dollars.\r\n  Twenty copies for one year,     Thirty-six dollars.\r\n\r\n  PAID IN ADVANCE\r\n\r\n  _Postage, Thirty-six cents a year_, TO BE PAID BY THE SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\n  SINGLE COPIES.\r\n\r\n  Three Dollars a year, IN ADVANCE.--_Postage paid by the Publisher._\r\n\r\n  JOHN F.

No State in the Valley of the\r\nMississippi offers so great an inducement to the settler as the State of\r\nIllinois. There is no part of the world where all the conditions of\r\nclimate and soil so admirably combine to produce those two great\r\nstaples, CORN and WHEAT.\r\n\r\nCLIMATE.\r\n\r\nNowhere can the Industrious farmer secure such immediate results from\r\nhis labor as on these deep, rich, loamy soils, cultivated with so much\r\nease. The climate from the extreme southern part of the State to the\r\nTerre Haute, Alton and St. Louis Railroad, a distance of nearly 200\r\nmiles, is well adapted to Winter.\r\n\r\nWHEAT, CORN, COTTON, TOBACCO.\r\n\r\nPeaches, Pears, Tomatoes, and every variety of fruit and vegetables is\r\ngrown in great abundance, from which Chicago and other Northern markets\r\nare furnished from four to six weeks earlier than their immediate\r\nvicinity. Between the Terre Haute, Alton & St. Louis Railway and the\r\nKankakee and Illinois Rivers, (a distance of 115 miles on the Branch,\r\nand 136 miles on the Main Trunk,) lies the great Corn and Stock raising\r\nportion of the State.\r\n\r\nTHE ORDINARY YIELD\r\n\r\nof Corn is from 60 to 80 bushels per acre. Cattle, Horses, Mules, Sheep\r\nand Hogs are raised here at a small cost, and yield large profits. It is\r\nbelieved that no section of country presents greater inducements for\r\nDairy Farming than the Prairies of Illinois, a branch of farming to\r\nwhich but little attention has been paid, and which must yield sure\r\nprofitable results. Between the Kankakee and Illinois Rivers, and\r\nChicago and Dunleith, (a distance of 56 miles on the Branch and 147\r\nmiles by the Main Trunk,) Timothy Hay, Spring Wheat, Corn, &c., are\r\nproduced in great abundance.\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe Agricultural products of Illinois are greater than those of any\r\nother State. The Wheat crop of 1861 was estimated at 35,000,000 bushels,\r\nwhile the Corn crop yields not less than 140,000,000 bushels besides the\r\ncrop of Oats, Barley, Rye, Buckwheat, Potatoes, Sweet Potatoes,\r\nPumpkins, Squashes, Flax, Hemp, Peas, Clover, Cabbage, Beets, Tobacco,\r\nSorgheim, Grapes, Peaches, Apples, &c., which go to swell the vast\r\naggregate of production in this fertile region. Over Four Million tons\r\nof produce were sent out the State of Illinois during the past year.\r\n\r\nSTOCK RAISING.\r\n\r\nIn Central and Southern Illinois uncommon advantages are presented for\r\nthe extension of Stock raising. All kinds of Cattle, Horses, Mules,\r\nSheep, Hogs, &c., of the best breeds, yield handsome profits; large\r\nfortunes have already been made, and the field is open for others to\r\nenter with the fairest prospects of like results. Dairy Farming also\r\npresents its inducements to many.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF COTTON.\r\n\r\nThe experiments in Cotton culture are of very great promise. Commencing\r\nin latitude 39 deg. 30 min. (see Mattoon on the Branch, and Assumption\r\non the Main Line), the Company owns thousands of acres well adapted to\r\nthe perfection of this fibre. A settler having a family of young\r\nchildren, can turn their youthful labor to a most profitable account in\r\nthe growth and perfection of this plant.\r\n\r\nTHE ILLINOIS CENTRAL RAILROAD\r\n\r\nTraverses the whole length of the State, from the banks of the\r\nMississippi and Lake Michigan to the Ohio. As its name imports, the\r\nRailroad runs through the centre of the State, and on either side of the\r\nroad along its whole length lie the lands offered for sale.\r\n\r\nCITIES, TOWNS, MARKETS, DEPOTS.\r\n\r\nThere are Ninety-eight Depots on the Company's Railway, giving about one\r\nevery seven miles. Cities, Towns and Villages are situated at convenient\r\ndistances throughout the whole route, where every desirable commodity\r\nmay be found as readily as in the oldest cities of the Union, and where\r\nbuyers are to be met for all kinds of farm produce.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION.\r\n\r\nMechanics and working-men will find the free school system encouraged by\r\nthe State, and endowed with a large revenue for the support of the\r\nschools. Children can live in sight of the school, the college, the\r\nchurch, and grow up with the prosperity of the leading State in the\r\nGreat Western Empire.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPRICES AND TERMS OF PAYMENT--ON LONG CREDIT.\r\n\r\n  80 acres at $10 per acre, with interest at 6 per ct. annually\r\n  on the following terms:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $48 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           48 00\r\n     \"    in two years          48 00\r\n     \"    in three years        48 00\r\n     \"    in four years        236 00\r\n     \"    in five years        224 00\r\n     \"    in six years         212 00\r\n\r\n\r\n  40 acres, at $10 00 per acre:\r\n\r\n  Cash payment                 $24 00\r\n\r\n  Payment in one year           24 00\r\n     \"    in two years          24 00\r\n     \"    in three years        24 00\r\n     \"    in four years        118 00\r\n     \"    in five years        112 00\r\n     \"    in six years         106 00\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n  Number 12                         25 Cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The\r\n\r\n  Continental\r\n\r\n  Monthly\r\n\r\n  Devoted to Literature and National Policy.\r\n\r\n  DECEMBER, 1862.\r\n\r\n  NEW YORK:\r\n\r\n  JOHN F.

Devoted to the NATIONAL CAUSE, it\r\nwill ardently and unconditionally support the UNION. Its scope\r\nwill be enlarged by articles relating to our public defences, Army and\r\nNavy, gunboats, railroads, canals, finance, and currency. The cause of\r\ngradual emancipation and colonization will be cordially sustained. The\r\nliterary character of the Magazine will be improved, and nothing which\r\ntalent, money, and industry combined can achieve, will be omitted.\r\n\r\nThe political department will be controlled by HON. ROBERT J. WALKER and\r\nHON. FREDERIC P. STANTON, of Washington, D.C. Mr. WALKER, after serving\r\nnine years as Senator, and four years as Secretary of the Treasury, was\r\nsucceeded in the Senate by JEFFERSON DAVIS. MR. STANTON served ten years\r\nin Congress, acting as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and of Naval\r\nAffairs. MR. WALKER was succeeded as Governor of Kansas by MR. STANTON,\r\nand both were displaced by MR. BUCHANAN, for refusing to force slavery\r\nupon that people by fraud and forgery. The literary department of the\r\nMagazine will be under the control of CHARLES GODFREY LELAND of Boston,\r\nand EDMUND KIRKE of New York. MR. LELAND is the present accomplished\r\nEditor of the Magazine. MR. KIRKE is one of its constant contributors,\r\nbut better known as the author of \"Among the Pines,\" the great picture,\r\ntrue to life, of Slavery as it is.\r\n\r\nTHE CONTINENTAL, while retaining all the old corps of writers,\r\nwho have given it so wide a circulation, will be reënforced by new\r\ncontributors, greatly distinguished as statesmen, scholars, and savans.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nENTERED, according to Act of Congress, In the year 1862, by\r\nJAMES R.
