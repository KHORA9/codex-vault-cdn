CADELL, IN THE STRAND, LONDON.\r\nM.DCC.LXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN HUMBLE ADDRESS, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY LORDS AND GENTLEMEN,\r\n\r\nThough the Author of the ensuing Tract may be below your Notice, as an\r\nIndividual, yet the Subject he treats upon, highly deserves your most\r\nserious Attention. In the present unhappy Disputes between the\r\nParent-State and the Colonies, he undertakes to point out, what Measures\r\nthe Landed-Interest of _Great-Britain_ and _Ireland_ ought to pursue in\r\nfuture, for the Sake of themselves and their Posterity. And if what he has\r\nto offer, should, after a due Examination, be found to be reasonable,\r\nsolid, and satisfactory, he relies so much on your own good Sense and\r\nJudgment, as to believe, that you will not reject his Plan, merely because\r\nit originated from an inferior Hand. This is all the Favour he asks, or\r\nexpects from you.\r\n\r\nUpon this Subject, he waves the Consideration of every Thing, which might\r\nhave a Tendency to keep the present Question out of Sight. _Great-Britain_\r\nand her Colonies are now at open War. THIS IS THE FACT. But if it should\r\nbe asked, How these Things came to pass? From what Causes did they spring?\r\nWhich are the real, and which are the apparent Motives in this\r\nControversy? Moreover, who were originally and principally to blame? And\r\nwhat Methods ought to have been taken at first, in order to have prevented\r\nMatters from coming to their present Height?--The Author having already\r\ngiven his Sentiments on each of these Heads in his 3d, 4th, and 5th\r\npreceding Tracts, and also in his Letter to Mr. BURKE, will not here\r\nrepeat the same Things.--The grand Object now before him is simply this;\r\n_Great Britain and her Colonies are at open War_: And the proper and\r\nimportant Question arising from such a Fact is the following, _What is to\r\nbe done at the present Crisis?_\r\n\r\nThree Schemes have been proposed;--the Parliamentary,--Mr. BURKE's,--and\r\nmy own.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary Scheme is,--To maintain _vi et armis_ the Supremacy of\r\nthe Mother-Country over her Colonies, in as full and ample a Manner, as\r\nover any Part of the _British_ Dominions.\r\n\r\nMr. BURKE's is, [tho' not in express _Words_] To resign or relinquish the\r\nPower of the _British_ Parliament over the Colonies, and to erect each\r\nProvincial Assembly into an independent _American_ Parliament;--subject\r\nnevertheless to the King of _Great-Britain_, with his usual\r\nPrerogatives:--For which Favour of acknowledging the same Sovereign, the\r\nColonists are to be complimented with the most precious Rights,\r\nPrivileges, and Advantages of _British_ Subjects:--I say, _complimented_,\r\nand complimented even _gratuitously_:--For as to their contributing any\r\nProportion, either of Men or Money, towards the public Expence, and in\r\nReturn for those Favours--All this is to be entirely left to their own\r\ninnate Goodness and Generosity, to do just as they please.\r\n\r\nMy Scheme [which Mr. BURKE, in his last Speech of _March_ 22, 1775, is\r\npleased to term a _childish_ one] is,--To separate totally from the\r\nColonies, and to reject them from being Fellow-Members, and joint\r\nPartakers with us in the Privileges and Advantages of the _British_\r\nEmpire; because they refuse to submit to the Authority and Jurisdiction of\r\nthe _British_ Legislature:--Offering at the same Time to enter into\r\nAlliances of Friendship, and Treaties of Commerce with them, as with any\r\nother sovereign, independent States.\r\n\r\nNow, in order to determine, which of these Schemes is the most\r\neligible;--it would be right to consider, which is the easiest and most\r\npracticable,--which is least expensive,--which is likeliest to prevent\r\nsimilar Disturbances and Disputes for the future,--and which will least\r\nendanger the _English_ Constitution and our domestic Tranquility. For all\r\nthese Circumstances ought to be taken into the Account, before a due\r\nJudgment can be formed.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first, I wish for the present to be silent about\r\nit;--partly out of Respect to that august Body, which has given a Sanction\r\nto it;--partly because it is now upon Trial, whether it can be executed or\r\nnot;--and partly likewise because this must fall of Course, if either Mr.\r\nBURKE's, or mine, should be judged to have the Preference. For these\r\nReasons, I say, I wish to keep a respectful Silence on this Head.\r\n\r\nBut in respect to Mr. BURKE, I need not stand on so much Ceremony. For\r\ntho' he is confessedly a great _Rhetorician_, and can with his magic Voice\r\nraise a mighty Tempest of metaphorical Lightenings and Thunders;--yet,\r\nHeaven be praised, there is the Period of all his Powers: And his _verba\r\nardentia_, his _flaming Words_, are found to end at last (like many other\r\nExplosions) in Noise and Smoke. Nor doth it, I humbly apprehend, at all\r\nfollow, that the Orator is endowed with a greater Portion of political\r\nDiscernment than other Men, or with more disinterested Sincerity, and real\r\nLove of his Country, in making a just and honest Application of that\r\nDiscernment;--merely because he has more Words at Command, and can muster\r\nup a greater Army of bright Similes, and florid Expressions.\r\n\r\nBut be that as it may:--I now consider myself as standing at the Bar of\r\nthe public Tribunal: And therefore before the Jury is struck, and the\r\nTrial begins, I humbly beg Leave to claim, and to exercise one of the\r\ndistinguishing Privileges of _Englishmen_ in such Cases, viz. To except\r\nagainst all such Persons in the Pannel, who appear to be under a wrong\r\nBiass, and an undue Influence respecting the Nature of this Dispute.\r\n\r\nAnd 1st. I except against _Courtiers and Placemen_, considered _as such_.\r\nThis is not uttered out of a Spirit of Resentment, Pique, or\r\nDisappointment, according to the Mode of modern Times. For, I thank God, I\r\nhave no Cause to complain of any Disappointment; having since my\r\nAdvancement to the Deanery of _Glocester_ in the Year 1758, neither\r\ndirectly nor indirectly made the least, or the most distant Application\r\nfor any other or higher Station. This Renunciation of aspiring Views is a\r\nCircumstance, which I am persuaded Mr. BURKE knew perfectly well, by\r\nvarious Means, and from different Persons, especially from a noble Lord,\r\nformerly high in Office, and a great _Favourite_ at Court, but now his\r\nCoadjutor, and a flaming Patriot. And yet the Orator has been pleased to\r\ncharacterize me by Name in his Speech of the 19th of _April_, 1774, with\r\nout any Provocation, as one of those _Court-Vermin_ (such was his polite\r\nPhrase) who would do any thing for the Sake of a Bishopric.--Moreover I do\r\nnot make this Exception against Courtiers from any bad Opinion I have\r\nconceived of the present Set of Ministers; for I think it may be fairly\r\nallowed, without paying them any Compliment, that they are to the full as\r\n_able_, and as _honest_ as the best of those who are endeavouring to\r\nsupplant them. But nevertheless, as they are subject to many unhappy\r\nBiasses, which may draw their Judgments aside without sinister Intentions,\r\nthey ought to be excepted against in the present Dispute. In fact, while\r\nthe great Continent of _North America_ shall continue to be united to this\r\nIsland under any mode whatever, Persons in Administration will necessarily\r\nhave a Multitude of Places and Sine-cures to dispose of, many lucrative\r\nContracts to bestow; and, to speak in coarse tho' very expressive\r\n_English_, many JOBS of various Kinds, wherewith to gratify their Friends,\r\nand Dependents. Not to mention, that if ever a total Separation (such as\r\nproposed by my Plan) should ensue, the Ministry for the Time being, would\r\nrun a great Risque of falling a Sacrifice to the blind Zeal of popular\r\nDiscontents, and the knavish Intrigues of Party-Factions. Therefore for\r\nall these Reasons, I must insist, that Courtiers and Placemen ought to be\r\nexcepted against, as being not sufficiently unbiassed, or disinterested to\r\ndetermine impartially on the present Subject.\r\n\r\n2dly. I particularly except against the whole Band of Mock-Patriots. And\r\nmy Reason is, because this Race of Men will of Course, prefer that Scheme,\r\nwhatever it be, which can furnish them with the most lasting Fund for\r\nOpposition and Complaint. Now it is evident, that our Conjunction with\r\n_North-America_, upon any Terms, and under any, or every Modification,\r\nwill not fail of becoming an inexhaustible Source of Altercation and\r\nReproach, let whatever Measures be pursued. For Example: Had the Ministry\r\nproposed at first that very Scheme, which Mr. BURKE has now thought proper\r\nto recommend, the Heads of the Faction, and even Mr. BURKE himself (if he\r\nhad not been a Pensioner to _North-America_) would most probably have\r\nproposed just the Reverse; that is, they and he would have insisted on the\r\nNecessity of _obliging_ the Colonies to contribute a Share,\r\n_proportionable to their Interests, and to the growing Benefits they\r\nreceive_, towards the Maintenance, the Grandeur, and the Glory of that\r\nEmpire, from which their own Preservation and Prosperity are derived. And\r\nthen the popular Cry would have been, that a wicked and a profligate\r\nAdministration were going to sacrifice the Honour and Dignity of the\r\n_British_ Crown, and the dear-bought Rights and Privileges of the\r\n_British_ Nation to _American_ Gold, and _American_ Ingratitude.--Then we\r\nshould have been told (and every Town and Country News-Paper would have\r\nechoed and re-echoed the Tale) that _America_ was the Property of\r\n_Great-Britain_ by every possible and legal Claim;--by Right of\r\nDiscovery,--Right of Occupancy,--Right of Possession,--uninterrupted\r\nPrescription,--Communication of Benefits,--Participation of Posts of\r\nHonour, and Places of Profit,--general Protection,--never-ceasing Defence,\r\n&c. &c. And then we should have been told with peculiar Emphasis, that\r\nthis new-fangled, ministerial Scheme of erecting so many new Parliaments,\r\nall co-ordinate with each other, under one general Monarch, was not only a\r\nnotorious Breach of the _English_ Constitution, and utterly repugnant to\r\nthe Law of the Land,--but was also a deep-laid, diabolical Contrivance to\r\nsubjugate these petty Parliaments, one after another, and all in their\r\nTurns, to the irresistible Power of one grand Despot:--In short, then it\r\nwould have been said (and with great Appearance of Truth) that _divide, et\r\nimpera_ was the ministerial Maxim;--and that, what was done, or going to\r\nbe done in _America_, was only the Omen and Prelude to the like fatal\r\nEstablishments here in _Britain_. For the next Step would be (and upon a\r\nPretence full as good, and altogether as constitutional) to break to\r\nPieces the united Force of the _British_ Parliament, by erecting one\r\ndiminutive Assembly of States at _Edinburgh_, another at _York_, a third\r\nat _London_, and a fourth at _Bath_, or _Exeter_, or somewhere in the\r\nWest: And then, partly by flattering and cajoling,--partly by Bribes or\r\nBullying,--by exciting their Hopes, or their Fears at one Time,--and their\r\nJealousies at another,--and by playing off each of these puny Assemblies\r\nagainst its Rival, the Minister would necessarily become omnipotent;--and\r\nthen farewell to the Liberties of _Old England_.\r\n\r\n3dly. I object also against all those of whatever Denomination, from the\r\nroaring Patriot in the Senate, to the miserable Scribbler in the Garret,\r\nwho are the Pensioners of _France_, or _Spain_, or of any other rival\r\nPower:--I say, I object against their being Judges in this Dispute,\r\nbecause the very Intent of their receiving Pay is to promote Discord, and\r\nto cherish Faction;--and because they cannot earn their Wages with more\r\nFacility, or with surer Success to their Employers, than by patronizing\r\nsuch Schemes, as will necessarily keep up the Disputes between\r\n_Great-Britain_ and her Colonies.\r\n\r\nBut here the Smartness of Debate (to use one of Mr. BURKE's very smart\r\nExpressions) will be apt to say, \"Who are those Persons against whom your\r\nInsinuations are levelled? Name them, if you are able: And as you ought to\r\nbe furnished with the most positive Proofs, before you are entitled to\r\nthrow out such Invectives, give them to the Public, in order that we may\r\nhold these Traitors to their Country in just Abhorrence.\"\r\n\r\nTo all which strong Words I would beg Leave to suggest the following\r\nAnswers.\r\n\r\n1. I think it may be allowed, without injuring the Cause of Truth, or even\r\nCharity, that a Man may be fully convinced of a bad Design, or a wicked\r\nScheme being in Agitation, without being able to prove, who are the\r\nPersons concerned in it. It is not usual for the Guilty to call upon the\r\nInnocent to step forwards and be their Accusers: Nor can it be expected,\r\nthat the Names of the Conspirators should be the first Thing in any\r\nConspiracy which is to be brought to Light. Indeed, generally speaking,\r\nthis is the last Part of any Plot, or of any bad Design, which can be\r\nfully known, or legally ascertained. And therefore, if either the\r\nExperience of former Times, or the Nature of the Case, can afford probable\r\nReasons, and circumstantial Evidence in Support of this Assertion, _That\r\nthere are Numbers of Pensioners to Foreign Powers now among us_--surely\r\nwe have obtained all the Proofs that are necessary at present towards\r\nestablishing a general Belief of the Fact, (which is the only Point here\r\ncontended for;) and we must leave to Time, that great Discoverer of\r\npolitical Machinations, to unravel the rest.\r\n\r\nWherefore, 2dly. Let it be observed, that the History of this very Country\r\nfurnishes us with striking Examples in Confirmation of the above\r\nAssertion. Particularly during the memorable Reigns of CHARLES the Second,\r\nand WILLIAM the Third, that is, just before, and just after the\r\nRevolution, there were many venal _Englishmen_, both in the Senate and out\r\nof it, the Pensioners of _France_; who, to be sure, meant nothing by what\r\nthey said or did on these Occasions, and for such Pay, but the Good of\r\ntheir dear bleeding Country; who therefore stormed and thundered,\r\nspeechified and harangued, printed and published out of pure,\r\ndisinterested Zeal for the Welfare of poor, old _England_!\r\n\r\nHence therefore I infer, 3dly, That the like may happen again, or rather\r\nhas happened already, unless it can be shewn, either, that _France_ and\r\n_Spain_ want no such Agents at present; or if they did, that they cannot\r\nnow, as heretofore, find them here in _Britain_. In regard to the first of\r\nthese Positions, whosoever will give himself the Trouble, to examine\r\ncoolly and impartially into the slender Reasons alledged on our Parts, for\r\nbeginning two of the most bloody and destructive Wars, that ever were\r\nknown, will find sufficient Cause to believe, that those Powers will\r\nalways think it to be more for their Interests, to cut out Work at Home\r\nfor these restless and turbulent Islanders (as they are pleased to call\r\nus) than to let us be at Peace among ourselves, lest that Circumstance\r\nshould give us an Opportunity of picking Quarrels with our Neighbours. And\r\nmost certain it is, that both the former _Spanish_ (or the _No-Search_)\r\nWar, and the latter _French_ (or the _Acadia_ and _Ohio_) War, were begun\r\nand carried on principally with a View to promote the immediate Interests\r\nof the Northern Colonies; the former to protect their Smugglers, when\r\nhovering about the Coasts, and when actually trading in the prohibited\r\nPorts of the _Spanish West-Indies_; and the latter, (a War, alas! begun,\r\nwithout so much as a Declaration of War!) to do, I know not what! unless\r\nit was to enable the grateful Colonies to rebel against the Mother\r\nCountry, perhaps a Generation or two sooner, than otherwise they would\r\nhave done. But be that as it may, one Thing is certain, and beyond\r\nDispute, that the more we are embroiled among ourselves, the less Cause\r\nwill the other Powers of _Europe_ have to fear our giving them any\r\nDisturbance: And that 20,000l. or 30,000l. a Year spent in Bribes and\r\nPensions, properly disposed, to raise an Opposition against Government,\r\nand to enflame the Populace against their Rulers, will do more effectual\r\nService to the Courts of _France_ and _Spain_, than thirty Times these\r\nSums laid out in manning Fleets, or equipping Squadrons or preparing and\r\nembarking Troops for an Invasion.\r\n\r\nIf therefore these Points are so self-evident, as not to be denied, the\r\nonly Question now remaining is this, Can it be supposed, or is it\r\ncredible, that a popular _British_ Senator, a _British_ Pamphleteer, or a\r\n_British_ News-writer, in an Age so pure and uncorrupt as ours, would\r\naccept of a Bribe, or a Pension on such dishonourable Conditions? And are\r\nnot all these illustrious Personages either of such well known independent\r\nFortunes, or of such spotless Characters, and approved Virtue, as to be\r\nsuperior to any Temptation of this Sort? Now here I say nothing, but chuse\r\nto be silent; and earnestly entreat every Reader to judge for himself.\r\nIndeed there was a Time, when a Text of sacred Scripture might have been\r\nurged, as carrying some Weight in deciding the present Question: \"Beware\r\nof false Prophets, who come to you in Sheep's Cloathing, but inwardly they\r\nare ravening Wolves. Ye shall know them by their Fruits. Do Men gather\r\nGrapes of Thorns, or Figs of Thistles? Even so every good Tree bringeth\r\nforth good Fruit; but a corrupt Tree bringeth forth evil Fruit. A good\r\nTree cannot bring forth evil Fruit, neither can a corrupt Tree bring forth\r\ngood Fruit.--WHEREFORE BY THEIR FRUITS YE SHALL KNOW THEM.\" I say, there\r\nwas a Time, when the Authority of such a Caution would have been regarded\r\nas more decisive than the Productions of our modern licentious Presses.\r\nBut as we now live in very extraordinary Times, full of new Lights, and\r\nnew Discoveries, I forbear, lest our Patriots should accuse me of Bigotry,\r\nPriestcraft, or Superstition[1].\r\n\r\n4thly. I expressly except against all Persons of _Republican_ Principles\r\nfor very obvious Reasons; for tho' they dignify themselves by the Name of\r\nWHIGS, yet as they are not the genuine, _constitutional Whigs_ of this\r\nKingdom, but an unnatural Superfoetation, and the avowed Enemies of the\r\n_British_ Constitution, they ought not to be allowed to sit in Judgment in\r\na _British_ Cause. They are, it is well known, the professed Advocates for\r\ncontinuing and cementing the Union between _Great-Britain_ and her\r\nColonies; and yet they wish, above all Things, to see these Colonies\r\ntotally exempt from, and independent of, the Power and Jurisdiction of the\r\n_British_ Legislature. Now, how are we to reconcile these glaring\r\nContradictions? And what is the Reason for professing such a preposterous\r\nZeal for _America_, in Preference both to the Interests and Honour of\r\ntheir native Country? The Reason is this:--They think, that by cherishing\r\nand protecting a republican Government in the Colonies, they are paving\r\nthe Way for introducing a similar Establishment into _Great-Britain_.\r\nTherefore _Republicism_ is the Bond of Union between these unnatural\r\n_Englishmen_ and their Fellow-Labourers of _America_: _Republicism_, I\r\nsay, [pardon the Use of a new Word, where the Language doth not afford a\r\nbetter] is made the _common Cause_ for uniting Persons of the most\r\ndiscordant Interests and different Inclinations in other Respects.\r\n\r\nAnd I will add, as an Illustration of this Matter, and to shew how far\r\ncertain Persons will go to obtain their Ends, that the Republicans in the\r\nReigns of CHARLES II. JAMES II. and WILLIAM III. joined the\r\nConstitutionalists in bringing about the Revolution, chiefly with the\r\nHopes, that a Prince who owed his Election to the Voice of the People,\r\nmight the easier be dethroned by the same People, whenever they could get\r\nthem into the Mood to do it, whether with, or without a Cause. For the\r\nvery Sound of Monarchy, however limited, or however well administered, is\r\ngrating to their Ears. They cannot bear to think, that one Man, or one\r\nFamily should be so much exalted above _themselves_, in Contradiction to\r\ntheir darling Maxim of a NATURAL EQUALITY. And this Scheme for laying the\r\nFoundation of a _new_ and _equal_ Republic is what the Republicans really\r\nintend by using the Phrase _Revolution Principles_ at this Day. In short,\r\nwe have now the most authentic Proofs, that their Predecessors of old\r\ntried all Means in their Power, and even applied to the Court of _France_\r\nfirst to prevent, and then to defeat the Revolution, and to set up a\r\nRepublican Form in its stead; alledging that it was more for the Interest\r\nof that Court to have a Republican Government take Place in _England_,\r\nsomewhat after the Example of that of _Holland_, than any Kind of\r\nMonarchical Constitution, because this, at one Time or other, might\r\nbecome a troublesome Neighbour, and a dangerous Rival; whereas nothing of\r\nthat Kind was to be feared from a mere simple _Democracy_. Moreover in\r\nsome Years afterwards, when the Crown was settled on the House of\r\n_Hanover_, we know it well, (for it is no Secret) that the Republicans\r\nboth then, and since, had no other Merit towards that House,\r\nnotwithstanding all their Boastings, than that of reserving its Princes,\r\nlike the Prisoners in CACUS's Den, _to be devoured the last_. A mighty\r\nFavour truly! For which our Ears are perpetually dinned with a Repetition\r\nof the Services of these Men towards the ungrateful House of _Hanover_!\r\n\r\nAnd now, my Lords and Gentlemen, having excepted against Courtiers and\r\nPlacemen as _such_,--against pretended Patriots _on every\r\nAccount_,--against the Pensioners of foreign Powers,--and against _rank\r\nRepublicans_;--my humble Request is, that the Cause between Mr. BURKE and\r\nme may be tried by the LANDED INTEREST ONLY. _They_ are certainly the\r\nproperest and most unexceptionable Judges; for they have _the most at\r\nStake_; and their Interest, and the Interest of the Public, must\r\nnecessarily coincide. They can gain nothing either by War, or Peace, by a\r\nSubmission to, or a Separation from, the Revolters in _North America_, but\r\nwhat must tend to the general, as well as to their own particular\r\nAdvantage. Whereas almost every other Rank of Men may find their Account,\r\nin countenancing and supporting such Measures, as may greatly enrich\r\nthemselves, tho' at the Expence of depopulating and impoverishing their\r\nnative Country.\r\n\r\nNor, my Lords and Gentlemen, is this Cause beneath your solemn Notice and\r\nRegard. In the former _Spanish_ [or no-search] War, you spent above _Sixty\r\nMillions_ Sterling, including the extraordinary Sums raised, and the fresh\r\nDebts contracted:--And in the last _French_, _Ohio_, or _Acadia_ War, you\r\nspent above NINETY MILLIONS STERLING, if computed after the same Manner,\r\nviz. Additional Sums annually raised, and new Debts contracted. And all,\r\nalas! for what!!!![2]\r\n\r\nBut without any Retrospect to Things past, let us look towards what is to\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nThe first Thing to be considered in the Dispute between Mr. BURKE and me,\r\nis, which of Our Schemes _is the easiest to be executed, and the most\r\npracticable_? He proposes that all Concessions should be made on our Parts\r\nin Favour of the Colonies; but that none, or next to none, should be made\r\nby them in Favour of _Great Britain_. Now this Proposal can never\r\nterminate the Dispute between us and them, but on one or other of the\r\nfollowing Suppositions.\r\n\r\nFirst, that the Parliament and People of _Great-Britain_ are now\r\nconvinced, that they have acted injuriously, illegally, and\r\nunconstitutionally in pretending to make any Laws, whether good or bad, to\r\nbind the _Americans_: Because they (the _Americans_) have their own\r\nLegislatures, which are totally independent of ours: And therefore we take\r\nShame to ourselves by revoking these pretended, usurping Laws. For in\r\nshort, the first Step in Politics, as well as in Morals, towards sincere\r\nRepentance, is _Restitution_. Or, secondly, though we should not give up\r\nthe Point of _Right_, of making Laws, and cry _peccavimus_,--yet we take\r\nfor granted, that no improper Use will be made of the great and manifold\r\nConcessions, contained in Mr. BURKE's Scheme; because we have to deal with\r\na People, who, (we know by long Experience) may be trusted with every\r\nThing, as being the _Quintessence of Honour and Honesty_, both in public\r\nand private Life, and particularly the _fair unsullied Monuments of\r\nnational Gratitude_.\r\n\r\nOr if this likewise should prove to be a Pill too large, and too nauseous\r\nfor _Englishmen_ to swallow;--then, thirdly, we are to suppose, in order\r\nto end all Controversy, that the Trade with these _North-Americans_ is so\r\nessential to our Interests, as a commercial Nation, that we must keep them\r\nin good Humour at any Rate, and at any Expence;--least they should deprive\r\nus of their Custom, to the utter Ruin of our Manufactures, Shipping,\r\nNavigation, &c. &c. &c.\r\n\r\nOr lastly, we must suppose, that old _England_ is in Fact grown so\r\nexceedingly weak and impotent, and _America_ so very strong and powerful,\r\nthat it is in vain to resist any Encroachments, which the Colonies may\r\nmake on the Mother-Country:--For in such Circumstances, it is more prudent\r\nto submit to the present Evils, great as they are, than to provoke our\r\nConquerors to inflict still greater.\r\n\r\nI say, one or other of these four Suppositions must necessarily be made,\r\nbefore Mr. BURKE's Plan can terminate in real Peace, and restore that\r\nHarmony, of which he makes such continual Boastings. Let him therefore, at\r\nhis own Leisure, take his Choice of either of the four, or even adopt them\r\nall, if he pleases, and make the most of them.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while, deign, my Lords and Gentlemen, to cast your Eyes on my\r\nPlan (_childish_ as it is represented by him to be) of a _total\r\nSeparation_. And first of all, is it practicable in itself? And could it\r\nbe executed with Ease, if heartily set about?--Suppose therefore, that you\r\nwere to recall your Fleets and Armies, and publish to the _Americans_ the\r\nfollowing Manifesto, couched under the Form of an Act of Parliament.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas many of the _British_ Provinces, Colonies, and Plantations in\r\n_North-America_, after having made, from Time to Time, various Attempts to\r\nthrow off, or subvert the legislative Authority and Jurisdiction of\r\n_Great-Britain_, have at length proceeded to the greatest and most daring\r\nOutrages for accomplishing the same, by entering into illegal Combinations\r\nand traiterous Conspiracies, and even by breaking out into open and\r\nundisguised Rebellion: And whereas the Inhabitants in general of the said\r\nProvinces, Colonies, and Plantations shew not the least Signs of Sorrow\r\nand Contrition for their past Offences, nor any Desire to implore the\r\nClemency of the Parent-State, which hath in all Instances cherished,\r\nsupported, and protected them at an immense Expence both of Blood, and\r\nTreasure; but on the contrary, continue to encrease their hostile\r\nPreparations for opposing, by Violence and Force of Arms, the Execution of\r\nthe Laws made by the supreme Legislature of Parliament for the due\r\nGovernance, and constitutional Dependence of such subordinate States and\r\nProvinces;\r\n\r\n\"Be it therefore enacted by the Kings most excellent Majesty, by and with\r\nthe Advice and Consent of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and of the\r\nCommons of _Great-Britain_ in Parliament assembled;--that every such\r\nProvince, Colony, and Plantation which either now is, or at the ___ Day of\r\n_____ next ensuing shall be found to be in Arms and Rebellion against the\r\nLaws and Authority of the supreme Legislature of _Great-Britain_, shall,\r\nfrom and after the Time above mentioned, be totally cut off, severed, and\r\nseparated from the British Empire; and that all its Inhabitants shall be\r\ndeclared, and are hereby declared to have lost and forfeited all\r\nPrivileges and Advantages, Benefits and Protection both by Sea and Land,\r\nbelonging, or supposed to belong to the Subjects of _Great-Britain_; and\r\nthat they shall be deemed, taken, and reputed, in all Courts of Law, and\r\nin all Respects whatever, to be as much Aliens and Foreigners, and subject\r\nto the same Incapacities, as if they had been Aliens born.\r\n\r\n\"Provided nevertheless, and to the Intent, that as far as the Nature of\r\nthe Case will admit, the _Innocent_ may not be involved in the Punishment\r\nintended only for the _Guilty_; be it enacted by the Authority aforesaid,\r\nthat it shall and may be lawful for his Majesty, and for his Heirs and\r\nSuccessors, at any Time, to grant a Pardon to a whole State, Province, or\r\nColony, now in Rebellion, under the Great Seal of the Realm; or to one or\r\nmore Inhabitant or Inhabitants thereof under the Seal Manual, and to\r\n_restore_ such Colony, or such Person or Persons to their former Rights\r\nand Privileges, as _British_ Subjects, when it shall appear to his Majesty\r\nin Council, that such a Province, or Colony, or such a Petitioner or\r\nPetitioners is, are, or shall be deserving of his Royal Clemency and\r\nFavour.\"\r\n\r\nSuppose, I say, such a Manifesto, or one to this Effect, and couched under\r\nthe Form of an Act of Parliament, to be proclaimed to the World concerning\r\nthe Rebellion now existing in _America_: And then I ask, what possible\r\nDifficulty could attend the Execution of it? Or who would even attempt to\r\nprevent it? The only People or Nation, who would wish to obstruct the\r\nExecution of such a Law, are the _Americans_ themselves; for they have no\r\nManner of Objection against participating in all Kinds of _Benefits_ to be\r\nderived from an _Union_ with us; tho' they raise such terrible Outcries\r\nagainst sharing in any of our _Burthens_: And yet their Efforts and\r\nOpposition would all be in vain; because, tho' you should even allow, that\r\nthey are able to maintain their Independence in _America_, that\r\nCircumstance would not render them the Conquerors of _Great-Britain_, much\r\nless of the rest of the World; who must of Course remain independent of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTherefore, so far at least my System must have the Preference to Mr.\r\nBURKE's.\r\n\r\n2dly. The next Question is, _Which System, can be carried into Execution\r\nwith the least Expence?_ And surely as we have hitherto been engaged in\r\nnothing but Profusion and Extravagance, it is now high Time to adopt, if\r\nwe can, some useful Scheme of Frugality and OEconomy in regard to\r\n_America_.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords and Gentlemen, here again permit me to ask, What Expences\r\ncan possibly attend the Execution of my Scheme?--The Thing itself is no\r\nsooner said, than done. And all the Charges attending it are summed up in\r\nthe triffling Articles of Pen, Ink, Paper, and Printing. Whereas Mr.\r\nBURKE's System, even according to his own Account, will entail upon you\r\nExpences always encreasing, nay, next to infinite. You must, for Example,\r\nwin over the Heads and Leaders of the new _American_ Parliaments by means\r\nof \"Great Honours and great Emoluments,\" [A pretty Periphrasis this to\r\ndescribe the Art of _Bribing_!] in order to cooperate with the Plans of\r\nthe _British_ Parliament, and to bear a Share of the general Burthens of\r\nthe _British_ Empire.\r\n\r\nYou must also guard their Coasts at all Times, and protect them from all\r\nInvaders: And when they chuse to amuse themselves by going _on smuggling_,\r\n_trucking_, _huckstering_, and _buccaneering_ Parties on the _Spanish_\r\nMain, then you must more particularly stand up in their Defence, and\r\ninsist on their Vessels not being searched by the _Spanish_ Guarda-costas.\r\nAnd if the _Spaniards_ should think this an hard Measure, and appeal to\r\nthe Practice and Example of _Englishmen_ themselves, who never fail to\r\nsearch the Ships of all Nations, if found hovering on their Coasts, you\r\nmust positively and vehemently say, that the _Case is widely\r\ndifferent_:--Then you have a sufficient Plea for declaring War against\r\nthem;--then, my Lords and Gentlemen, resolve (as your Predecessors did\r\nbefore) never to make Peace 'till the Right of Searching is given\r\nup;--then spend another _sixty_ or _ninety_ Millions in this new\r\nQuarrel;--and at last make Peace, (as they did) without ever mentioning\r\nthe Right of not being searched; for which alone they pretended to go to\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all:--For when the Back-Settlers in _America_ shall have\r\n\"topped the _Apalachian_ Mountains in sufficient Numbers to constitute\r\nHords of _English_ Tartars, pouring down an irresistible Cavalry on the\r\nunfortified Frontiers;\"--who is to _resist_ these _Irresistibles_?--Not\r\nthe Colonists or Provincials; for they, poor People, tho' now 150,000\r\nstrong, [see General LEE's Letter] to fight against their Protectors and\r\nDefenders, will nevertheless be so frightened at the Sight of this\r\n_Apalachian_ Tartar Cavalry, that they will again cry out for Help to the\r\nMother-Country;--again, I say, as they did before, when only an handful of\r\n[3] _French_ and _Indians_ appeared against them. And indeed, if the\r\nMother-Country will act the Part of _Don Quixote_ to that Degree, as to\r\nexpend her best Blood and Treasure in their Cause, why should they incur\r\nany Dangers in their own dear Persons? Why be at the Pains and Charges of\r\ndefending themselves, when they can so easily get the _British_ Nation to\r\nfight, and bleed, and do every Thing for them? Besides Mr. BURKE has\r\nalready declared in express Terms, [Page 98, 2d. Edit.] that AMERICA MUST\r\nNOT BE EXHAUSTED. Exhaust, therefore, yourselves, my Lords and Gentlemen!\r\nas much as you please, or as much as you can; but don't expect Assistance\r\nfrom _America_, even in her own Defence, whilst she can get such\r\nKnight-Errants as the _English_ to fight her Battles; and whilst she can\r\nraise Patriots and Pamphleteers, News-Writers and Republicans, without\r\nNumber, to yell the _American_ War Hoop, and to denounce BLACK and BITTER\r\nDays against those, who should even hesitate to obey her Commands.\r\n\r\nBut the third Question is, Which Scheme is _best calculated to prevent the\r\nlike Disturbances for the future_?\r\n\r\nAnd here I would humbly beg Leave to observe, that if my Scheme had\r\nnothing else to recommend it to your Notice, it most infallibly cuts off\r\nall the present Causes of Dispute and Contention between the two\r\nCountries; so that they never can revive again. Whereas Mr. BURKE's is,\r\nat best, but a temporary Cessation from Hostilities; a mere Truce, 'till\r\nboth Parties can be recruited, and better provided to begin the War again.\r\nNay, his would be found in the Event,--not only to be no Manner of Cure or\r\nPalliation of the present Evils, but even greatly to foment them, and also\r\nto engender many new ones.\r\n\r\nFor Example:--Granting, that Peace was made on the very Terms, which Mr.\r\nBURKE requires:--Granting, that we repealed every Act of Parliament to\r\nwhich the _Americans_ have thought proper to object:--Granting also, that\r\nwe renounce for ever any Claim of Right to levy Taxes:--And granting, in\r\nshort, that the _American_ Assemblies became so many distinct Parliaments,\r\nsupreme within themselves, and independent of all others:--Still, whilst\r\nthese _American Independents_ are to be protected by the _British_ Flag;\r\nwhilst they are to enjoy all the Rights and Privileges of natural-born\r\n_British_ Subjects, both at Home, and Abroad, and in every Part of the\r\nGlobe,--Questions _will_, and _must_, and _ought_ to arise, on what Terms\r\nare these independent _Americans_ to be thus protected? And what\r\nCompensation is to be made to the Mother-Country, for communicating to\r\nthem her most valuable Rights and Privileges? Are they really to enjoy all\r\nPosts of Honour and Preferment, and all Places of Trust and Profit, and\r\nto be entitled to every Sort of Advantage, [4] Safeguard, and Protection,\r\nequally with the Natives of _Great-Britain_; and yet to make no Recompence\r\nor Acknowledgement for all these Favours?--The Answer of every staunch\r\n_American_, and of Mr. BURKE their Advocate General, must be as follows,\r\n(for on their Principles they can return no other) That each independent\r\n_American_ Parliament will be ready to _give_ and to _grant_ to _Great\r\nBritain_, by Way of Recompense or Gratification, the whole Sum\r\nof--_whatever they shall think proper, and no more_[5]. And that in\r\nrespect to the Regulations of _American_ Commerce, they will consent, that\r\nyou shall put whatever nominal Restraints you please upon it, provided\r\nyou will not enforce such Restraints by any Forfeitures or Penalties,\r\nwhich shall imply _the most distant Idea of Taxation_;--and provided also\r\nthat, if Offences should be supposed to be committed, they, (the\r\n_Americans_) and no others shall be allowed to be Judges both of the\r\nNature, and of the Degree of each Offence; and that the Cause shall be\r\ntried no where else, but in their own _American_ Courts, and by their own\r\n_American_ Juries.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords and Gentlemen, suffer me I beseech you, to appeal to your\r\nown good Sense and Understandings on this Head.--Ask yourselves this plain\r\nQuestion, Is such a Plan of Reconciliation as Mr. BURKE proposes, a likely\r\nMethod of terminating the present Disputes between the Mother-Country and\r\nher Colonies? Nay ask farther;--Hath it so much as a Tendency to cool and\r\nmoderate them? Or rather doth it not seem much better contrived to\r\nenflame, than to extinguish; to kindle new Fires, than to quench old ones?\r\n\r\nBesides, when each of these _American_ Assemblies shall be erected into a\r\ndistinct Parliament, supreme within itself, and independent of the\r\nrest,--Is it possible to suppose, that no _new_ Disputes, or _new_\r\nDifferences will arise between such co-ordinate States and rival\r\nPowers;--_neighbouring_, _jealous_, and _contending_ Powers, I say, whose\r\nrespective Limits are in many Instances as yet undefined, if really\r\ndefinable! And is it at all consistent with any Degree of common Sense, or\r\ndaily Experience, to suppose that such Combustibles as these will not\r\nspeedily catch Fire?--Especially, if we take into the Account, the\r\ndiscordant Tempers of the Inhabitants of these respective Provinces, their\r\ninbred Hatreds and Antipathies against each other, their different Modes\r\nof Life, the Differences of Climate, Religion, Manners, Habits of\r\nThinking, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nNow, when Tumults and Disorders shall arise from any of these various\r\nCauses,--What is to be done? And to whom, or to what common Head, or\r\ngeneral Umpire is the appellant Province to carry her Complaint?--The\r\nParliament of _Great-Britain_, it seems, must no longer interfere; for\r\nthat is no longer the supreme Head of the Empire, to which all the Parts\r\nused to be subordinate, and professed to be obedient; therefore, being\r\ndestitute of any authoritative or constitutional Right to _compel_\r\nSubmission, all it can do, is to offer its good Services by Way of\r\nMediation; and that is, generally speaking, just nothing at all.\r\n\r\nIs then the KING (abstracted from the Parliament) to be appealed to in\r\nthis arduous Affair? And is he alone (in his mere _personal Capacity_) to\r\ncommand the Peace to be preserved between State and State, or Province and\r\nProvince.----[6]Is he, I say (abstracted from being a King of\r\n_Great-Britain_) to summon all the Parties before himself and his Privy\r\nCouncil, in order to hear their respective Allegations, and finally to\r\ndetermine, and settle the Differences between them? Be it so: Then if he\r\nonly is to decide, _as in an Affair relating to his own private Patrimony,\r\nin which we have no more Concern than we have with Hanover_,--it\r\nnecessarily follows, that he must be invested with sufficient Power\r\n(independent of, and without the Consent of Parliament) to enforce these\r\nDecisions; for a Decree without a Power to enforce it, and to compel\r\nObedience, is altogether nugatory and vain.\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords and Gentlemen, this brings us to the last Point of\r\nComparison between Mr. BURKE's, _and my System_, viz. Which will least\r\nendanger, or rather, which is best adapted to preserve our present happy\r\nConstitution?\r\n\r\nMr. BURKE's you see (if consistent with itself) must invest the Prince\r\nwith an amazing Degree of Power!--Even with such a Degree, as shall be\r\nsufficient to controul the refractory States of _America_, from one End of\r\nthe Continent to the other. Nay, what is still more, this _supreme_,\r\n_controuling_ Power must be the only CENTER OF UNION throughout the\r\nEmpire. Nothing besides is so much as proposed; and indeed nothing besides\r\n(when the parliamentary Connection is dissolved) can be sufficient to\r\n_tie_ all the Parts together;--Parts so widely distant, so totally\r\ndisjointed from each other, as the _British_ Isles and the _American_\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nNow here again permit me to ask, Is not this a very alarming Circumstance\r\neven in Contemplation? And is all our boasted Zeal for Liberty to end at\r\nlast only in that _Union_ and _Connection_ which can be procured to the\r\nseveral detached Parts of the Empire by Means of a Court, and of a\r\nstanding Army?--A large standing Army to be kept up independently of the\r\n_British_ Parliament!--And that too for the express Purpose of enforcing\r\nthe Decrees and Arbitrations of the Court!\r\n\r\nBut this is not all; for even a standing Army would not be so formidable\r\n(because it would soon moulder away) were no Means to be found out for its\r\nSupport and Maintenance: And this Scheme of many independent Parliaments\r\npoints to the very Means of obtaining the necessary Supplies; for, as an\r\ningenious Foreigner has very judiciously observed[7], \"A Sovereign who\r\ndepends, with regard to Supplies, on several Assemblies, in Fact depends\r\nupon none. An Agent for the _American_ Colonies, [I suppose the Author\r\nmeant Dr. FRANKLIN] in his Examination before the House of Commons,\r\n(_Anno_ 1766, P. 122) has even suggested in three Words the whole\r\nSubstance of what I have endeavoured to prove on that Subject; when he\r\nsaid, _The Granting Aids to the Crown is the only Means the Americans\r\nhave of_ RECOMMENDING THEMSELVES TO THEIR SOVEREIGN. Nothing therefore\r\ncould be more fatal to _English_ Liberty (and to _American_ Liberty in the\r\nIssue) than the Adoption of the Idea, cherished by the _Americans_, of\r\nhaving distinct independent Assemblies of their own, who should treat\r\nimmediately with the King, and grant him Subsidies, to the utter\r\nAnnihilation of the Power of those antient, and hitherto successful\r\nAssertors of general Liberty, the _British_ Parliament.\"\r\n\r\nTo these Reflections in this and in other Parts of his Book, the judicious\r\nAuthor adds many striking Examples, particularly the present State of the\r\nWant of Liberty in _France_ and _Spain_, by way of confirming and\r\ncorroborating his Argument. But in my humble Opinion there is still a more\r\nforcible Example to be drawn from the Case of the hereditary Dominions of\r\nthe House of _Austria_. For it is well known, that the Princes of that\r\nHouse rule in as absolute a Manner over every Part of their vast\r\nPossessions as the Sovereigns either of _France_ or _Spain_; and yet there\r\nare States (answering to our Parliaments) in almost every Country\r\nbelonging to the _Austrian_ Dominions; nay, these States are frequently\r\nsummoned to meet together; which is not the Case with the _general\r\nnational Assemblies of France_, or with the _Cortes_ of _Spain_. How then\r\ncomes it to pass,--that such Meetings produce little or no Effects in\r\nregard to the obtaining of a _reasonable_ Degree of Liberty for the\r\nSubject, which every Subject, if in his right Senses, wishes to obtain?\r\nThe Reason is obvious:--There are a Multitude of little States or\r\nParliaments within the Territories of the House of _Austria_;--the States\r\nof _Austria_ (not to mention the several still lesser States in the\r\n_Netherlands_) the States of _Bohemia_, States of _Hungary_, of\r\n_Transilvania_, _Stiria_, _Carinthia_, _Carniola_, &c. &c. But all these\r\npetty States, or Parliaments being totally independent of, and\r\nconsequently _Competitors_ with, and _Rivals_ to each other, never can act\r\nin Concert, or pursue one general Plan, or attend to one _common\r\nInterest_:--So that the Power of the Prince, which would have been too\r\nweak to have contended with them all, if all had been UNITED (like the\r\nParliament of _Great-Britain_) in _one compact, and general\r\nBody_,--becomes an _Over-match_ for any one of them singly and disjointed\r\nfrom the rest:--And this is the true Reason, why the House of _Austria_\r\ngoverns all her Provinces with so high an Hand at this Day. In short,\r\n_Divide et impera_, explains the whole Mystery of this Affair:--And\r\n_Great-Britain_ may here see her own Picture, drawn to the Life, if ever\r\nshe should consent to the Erection of Parliaments in _North-America_, to\r\nbe _co-ordinate_ with her own; and at the same Time should allow these\r\n_North-Americans_ to be _Co-partners_ with herself in one common Empire.\r\n\r\nBut why do I labour to prove this Point? Mr. BURKE himself is as\r\nconscious, as I can be, of the dreadful Effects, which must necessarily\r\nattend the Execution of his Scheme. Hear him therefore in his own\r\nWords:--[8]\"We know that the Emulations of such Parties [to be created by\r\nthe independent Parliaments of _North-America_] their Contradictions,\r\ntheir reciprocal Necessities, their Hopes and their Fears, _must_ send\r\nthem all in their Turns to him who holds the BALANCE of the State. The\r\nParties are the Gamesters, but Government keeps the Table, and is sure to\r\nbe the Winner in the End. When this Game is played, I really think, it is\r\nmore to be feared, that the [_American_] People will be exhausted, than\r\nthat Government will not be supplied.\"\r\n\r\nNow, my Lords and Gentlemen! be pleased to compare these _Fears_ of Mr.\r\nBURKE, \"that the _Americans_ will be too _lavish_ in their Grants,--with\r\nthe _Hopes_ entertained by the Agent (just quoted from Monsieur De LOLME)\r\nthat the _Americans_ by Means of _liberal Grants_ may recommend themselves\r\nto the good Graces of their Prince;\"--and then you will have full\r\nPossession of all Dr. FRANKLIN's favourite Speculation for removing the\r\nSeat of Empire from hence to _North-America_, and for abandoning the\r\n_British_ Isles to the Care of Deputies, Vice Roys, and Lord Lieutenants.\r\nMany of you, I make no Doubt, have heard him declare, that the great\r\nContinent of _British America_ (which, according to his Computation, will\r\ncontain nearly ONE HUNDRED MILLIONS of Inhabitants in little more than a\r\nCentury) ought to become the Seat of general Empire. And it might be\r\neasily gathered from the whole Turn of his Conversation, that he thought\r\nit no very difficult Matter in the Course of Things to bring this\r\nimportant Point to bear;--that is, to induce some future Sovereign of this\r\nCountry to make the wished for Exchange;--partly by the Obstacles which\r\nmight be thrown in his Way, were he to persist in remaining here\r\n[Obstacles, of which we have an _egregious Specimen_ already] and partly\r\nby the alluring Temptations which might be offered him to quit this petty\r\nSpot, and reside in _America_.--I say, many of you must have heard Dr.\r\nFRANKLIN haranguing after this Sort; or have seen Letters from him to the\r\nsame Effect:--For that this was his darling Scheme, even before he came to\r\nreside in _England_, I have been well assured; as well as his favourite\r\nTopic ever afterwards. Therefore I will add, that by the Help of this\r\nComment, we can explain many Passages in the Declarations of the grand\r\n_American_ Congress, which otherwise must appear to be either nauseous\r\nCompliments, or gross Contradictions:--The Passages I refer to, are the\r\nProtestations so often and so solemnly repeated, that they [the\r\n_Americans_] have no Intention of separating from this Country; and that\r\nthey have the purest Loyalty to the King, and the strongest Attachment to\r\nthe illustrious House of _Hanover_. This Key therefore unlocks the whole\r\nMystery of their (otherwise unaccountable) Proceedings. And as POPE said\r\non another Occasion:\r\n\r\n  'Tis in the _ruling Passion_: There alone,\r\n  The Wild are constant, and the _Cunning_ known.\r\n  This Clue, once found, unravels all the rest.\r\n  The Prospect clears, and CLODIO stands confest.\r\n\r\nIn the mean Time, because his Majesty is graciously disposed to join with\r\n_Great-Britain_ against _America_ in this Contest for Empire, (for in Fact\r\n_that is_ the _real_ Dispute, whatever may be the _Pretence_) not only\r\nmany among the _Americans_, which is natural enough, but (Shame to tell!)\r\neven among _Englishmen_ themselves, vent the bitterest Reproaches against\r\nhim for being the best Friend and Protector of the Mother-Country. Surely\r\nPosterity will stand amazed at such a Procedure! The like Scenes of\r\nInfatuation and Ingratitude (not to mention Disloyalty and Rebellion)\r\nnever yet disgraced the Annals of the World! And it seems to be reserved\r\nas a Mark of Infamy peculiar to the present Age, and to our modern Race of\r\nPatriots, that while the Prince on the Throne is incessantly endeavouring\r\nto keep his People free, and to secure their Freedom more and more by all\r\nproper and constitutional Measures, such Numbers should be found amongst\r\nhis Subjects, who are equally industrious to thwart his truly patriotic\r\nDesigns, and to rush headlong into Slavery.\r\n\r\nBut as Providence very often brings the greatest Good out of the worst of\r\nEvils, let us not despair, but that these very Attempts, wicked and\r\nunnatural as they are, may be the Means of uniting all honest, and\r\nwell-intentioned Men the firmer together, in order to support, and even to\r\nstrengthen the present Constitution. For Example, the two great Islands of\r\n_Britain_ and _Ireland_, which are only separated by a narrow Sea, ought\r\nnot to be separated at all by different Governments, Laws, or Parliaments.\r\nNo good Reason upon Earth can be given for such a Separation: And it has\r\nlong been the ardent Wish of every true Patriot in both Nations, to see\r\nthem united. Indeed, the best that can be said for the Continuance of the\r\npresent absurd System is, that the City of _Dublin_ would be a Sufferer by\r\nthe Removal of the Court and Parliament:--I say, this is the very\r\nArgument, which can be urged: And yet this has no Foundation at all, but\r\nin the Prejudices of the Populace, who are almost perpetually mistaking\r\ntheir own Interests. Even the City of _Dublin_ would be a very great\r\nGainer by such a Removal: For it would acquire _Industry_ in Exchange for\r\n_Idleness_; and then the Hands of its Tradesmen, by being the Hands of the\r\nDiligent, would enrich each other by reciprocal Employment;--the Hands, I\r\nsay, of those very Tradesmen, who in their present State, are almost as\r\npoor, as the poorest in the Kingdom.--That this is the natural and\r\nnecessary Course of Things, and not an idle Theory, or visionary\r\nSpeculation, I appeal to Fact and daily Experience;--and I appeal, not\r\nonly to the Case of _Edinburgh_, which is now three Times, at least, as\r\nrich and flourishing, as when it was the Residence of a Court, and of a\r\nParliament; but I appeal also to almost every Town in _Ireland_: _Cork_\r\nand _Belfast_ for Example, have neither Courts, nor Parliaments; and yet\r\ntheir Merchants, Manufacturers, and Traders are much richer in Proportion\r\nto their Numbers, than those of _Dublin_: And what is still more\r\nextraordinary, those little Towns, which once thought themselves happy in\r\nprocuring Barracks to be erected among them, in order to obtain, as they\r\nfondly imagined, _the Benefit of a great Flow of Money_, are now perfectly\r\nconvinced, that Towns without Barracks, or Towns from which Barracks have\r\nbeen removed, are in a much more flourishing Condition, then those which\r\nhave them.--Of so mischievous a Tendency is the Circulation of Money, when\r\nit becomes the Means of introducing Idleness, and of preventing Industry.\r\nFor, reason as long as you will on the Subject, the actual State of Things\r\nwill ever prove itself to be this, that Idleness is the Parent of Poverty,\r\nand Industry the only Source of real Riches.\r\n\r\nBut, my Lords and Gentlemen, this is not all; and my Scheme of an Union\r\nwith _Ireland_ is calculated not only to introduce Wealth, and to prevent\r\nIdleness in the single City of _Dublin_; but also to diffuse\r\nconstitutional Strength and Firmness, and to create a Stability and\r\nCompactness throughout the whole Empire: Whereas Mr. BURKE's has as\r\nnecessary a Tendency to weaken and disjoint every Part of it, and to sow\r\nJealousies and Dissentions both at Home and Abroad, in the Mother-Country,\r\nand in the Colonies:--The unavoidable Consequence of which would be at the\r\nlast, arbitrary and despotic Power. In one Word, the true Motto for my\r\nScheme is, _Vis unita fortior_; and for his, _Divide et impera_. Judge\r\ntherefore, as Men who are more deeply concerned in preserving and\r\nimproving the present Constitution, than any Class of Men\r\nwhatever;--judge, I say, whether Mr. BURKE's Scheme or mine, in regard to\r\n_America_, ought to have the Preference. You have every Means of\r\nInformation now at your Command: Your Birth, your Rank, and Education,\r\nlift you up much above the Prejudices of the Vulgar; whilst your\r\npatrimonial Estates and ample Fortunes screen you from a Multitude of\r\nthose Temptations, to which other Men are grievously exposed. And yet, my\r\nLords and Gentlemen, let me tell you, that if you will not exert\r\nyourselves on this trying Occasion, in some Degree proportionate to the\r\nImportance of the Cause now before you, perhaps it may never be in your\r\nPower to exert yourselves hereafter, when you would wish most ardently to\r\ndo it. Remember, therefore, I beseech you, the Words, the _emphatic_, and\r\nperhaps even the _prophetic_, Words of a celebrated Partizan, whose Name I\r\nneed not mention:--\"Why, Gentlemen, will not you, who are _Men of great\r\nLanded Estates_, take an active Part in the present Disputes? Your\r\nNeutrality, I do assure you, will not protect you. For if you will still\r\nremain inactive at such a Crisis, what has happened before will happen\r\nagain; and the *****'s and the *****'s who have but little to lose, but\r\nmay have much to get in Times of general Confusion, will certainly become\r\nthe great Men of this Nation.\"\r\n\r\n  _Fas est et ab hoste doceri._\r\n\r\nIndeed the Estates of the Church, we all know, will fall the first\r\nSacrifice, should the Republican Party now prevail. But nevertheless, if\r\nyou, my Lords and Gentlemen, should be so weak as to imagine, that Matters\r\nwill stop there; and that your own large Possessions, your splendid\r\nTitles, your hereditary Honours, and ample Privileges will escape unhurt,\r\namidst that general _Wreck_ of private Property, and _Crush_ of\r\nSubordination, which will necessarily ensue; you will be woefully\r\nmistaken:--And I must beg Leave to say, that you will have profited but\r\nvery little, by what has been so well written in the Annals of this very\r\nCountry, for your Instruction and Admonition. For depend upon it, the Use\r\nof _Committee-Men_, and the Business of _Sequestrators_ are not yet\r\nforgot; depend upon it, I say, that Ways and Means are still to be found\r\nout, for the lowest of the People to get at the Possession of the greatest\r\nof your Estates, as well in these, as in former Times. Their Appetites are\r\nequally keen:--And if these hungry Patriots should succeed, after such an\r\nExample is set before your Eyes, who are you to blame but yourselves?--In\r\none Word, you know, or ought to know, that even the tender Mercies of a\r\nRepublic are cruel. Or, if you are not yet convinced of the Truth of this\r\nAssertion, look abroad into the World; nay, look into what is now doing by\r\nthe Republican Congresses in _America_; and then see how you would approve\r\nsuch Men as these for YOUR MASTERS.\r\n\r\nHERE THEREFORE I willingly close the whole Dispute between Mr. BURKE and\r\nme: And I most chearfully submit the Decision of this important Question\r\nto those (but to _those only_) who are the best qualified, the most able,\r\nand the most concerned to decide impartially. What therefore is to follow\r\nin this Treatise, is to be considered rather _ex abundanti_, than as\r\nstrictly necessary for the Support of my Argument, and the Confutation of\r\nmy Opponent. Yet, seeing that the following Points may serve to elucidate\r\nsome of the former, and seeing that so much has been said, and such\r\nconfident Boastings have been uttered, concerning the Advantages, and even\r\nthe Immensity of the Colony-Trade; I will enter the more particularly into\r\nthese Matters.\r\n\r\nAnd first of all, and previous to any Enquiry into the Fact, I enter a\r\nsolemn Protest against the disingenuous Artifice, so often practiced by\r\nthe Partizans of _America_, viz. That OF BEGGING THE QUESTION. They beg\r\nthe Question, when they take for granted, that if _America_ were separated\r\nfrom _Great-Britain_, all commercial Intercourse would cease between the\r\ntwo Countries. For this is the very Point, which they ought to have\r\nproved, instead of taking it for granted. And prove it they never can,\r\n'till they shall have first demonstrated, that the _Americans_ will no\r\nlonger adhere to their own Interest, when they shall be disunited from\r\nus. A difficult Task this! In regard to which, they will find all the\r\nWorld to be Unbelievers. Indeed I have already so effectually silenced\r\nthis Plea in my Fourth Tract from Page 203 to Page 220, [2d Edit. printed\r\nfor RIVINGTON, &c.] that I hope I may be excused from repeating the same\r\nThings. And as the Arguments there urged have never been attempted to be\r\nanswered, notwithstanding so much Good-Will to do it, and that my\r\nOpponents most certainly would do it, if they could, the natural\r\nConclusion is, _that they are_ UNANSWERABLE.\r\n\r\nTherefore I now enter upon the Subject itself; and as the Trade to\r\n_Holland_ and _Germany_ (and _more particularly to_ Hanover) hath been\r\nfrequently represented as being very inconsiderable, and of small\r\nImportance; I have for this very Reason, selected this Trade from others,\r\nto make it the Subject of our Comparison with the Trade to all the\r\nrevolted Provinces of _North-America_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Account of the Value of the Exports from _England_ to _Germany_ and\r\n_Holland_;

And yet this very Period was more favourable to\r\n_American_ Exports than any other: 1st. Because during this Period, there\r\nwas the greatest Emigration from _Europe_ to _America_, and particularly\r\nfrom _Holland_ and _Germany_, that can be remembered; and each Emigrant,\r\nif a Customer to _England_, whilst resident in _Europe_, not only swells\r\nthe _American_ Account by his Removal, but also sinks the _European_: So\r\nthat he acts in a double Capacity, by adding Weight to one Scale, and by\r\nsubstracting, at least an equal, if not a greater, from the other:--2dly,\r\nBecause During this Period, the Colonists, and more especially the four\r\n_New-England_ Governments, were preparing for a _Non-Importation_ System;\r\nand therefore were storing their Magazines with great Quantities of Goods\r\nto serve for many Years. This Circumstance appears on the very Face of\r\nthe Account:--And 3dly, Because the Business of Commercial PUFFING, during\r\nthis Period, was carried, by the Partizans of _America_, to a greater\r\nHeight than ever, in order to make the _American_ Trade appear to be of\r\nmuch more Consequence to this Nation, than it really is.--To explain this\r\nArtifice of Commercial _Puffing_, to such Persons, who are not conversant\r\nin the Progress of Commercial Laws, I must beg their Attention to the\r\nfollowing short Narrative.--Formerly the Kings of _England_ established\r\ncertain Duties or Taxes (generally five per Cent. _ad Valorem_) both on\r\nthe Import and Export of Goods, _merely by Virtue of their own\r\nPrerogative_; and, as it was the _universal Practice_ for every Prince to\r\nact in the same Manner, these Duties or _customary_ Payments were\r\ntherefore called the CUSTOMS,--the Place where these Duties were paid the\r\n_Custom-House_, and the Officers who collected them the _Custom-House_\r\nOfficers. In Process of Time, the Subjects gained a little more Liberty;\r\nso that the Duties, which were originally imposed by Virtue of the mere\r\nPrerogative of the Crown, were afterwards collected by the Authority of an\r\n_Act_, or _Acts_ of the whole Legislature.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, notwithstanding this Change of Authority, there was very little\r\nAlteration in the System of Taxation: For _Exports_ as well as _Imports_\r\n(in those Days of commercial Blindness) paid a Duty of about five per\r\nCent. [9] _ad Valorem_, as low down as the Reigns of CHARLES II. and JAMES\r\nII.--King WILLIAM was the first Prince who had a true Notion of\r\nintroducing wise and beneficial Regulations into the System of\r\nExportation: For he caused the Duties to be taken off from the Exports of\r\n_English_ Woollen Manufactures, and of a few other Articles: Queen ANN\r\nfollowed his good Example, and extended the same politic System a little\r\nfarther: But it was reserved to the Reign of GEORGE I. and to the\r\nAdministration of that _great_ and _able_ Minister, Sir ROBERT WALPOLE\r\n(whom the Traders, and the Populace always abused) to enrich this Country\r\nby Means of a general System of _judicious_ Taxes, and salutary commercial\r\nRegulations. For in one single Act of Parliament in the Year 1722, (8th of\r\nG. I. Chap. 15.) there were about 196 Taxes repealed, [see CROUCH's Book\r\nof Rates] Taxes which had been injudiciously laid, partly on Raw-Materials\r\ncoming in, but chiefly on _British_ Manufactures going out. But tho' this\r\nexcellent Law was productive of the greatest Advantage to the Nation; yet\r\nit must be allowed, that like many other good Things, it was the innocent\r\nCause of introducing some Evil. For from that Time we may date the Origin\r\nof our modern _Puffing_, respecting the Export of Goods, which has spread\r\nbut too generally ever since. _English_ Manufactures, when entered in the\r\nCustom-House for Exportation, now pay no Tax or Duty; therefore this\r\nCircumstance becomes a Temptation to many Persons to make larger Entries\r\nfor Exportation, than in Truth and Reality they ought to do. Vanity, and\r\nthe Desire of appearing to be Men of large Dealings, and extensive\r\nCorrespondencies, and perhaps other Motives still less justifiable, will\r\nbut too well account for such Proceedings in the mercantile World.\r\nConsequently in commercial Puffing, the Traders to _Holland_ and\r\n_Germany_, and the Traders to _North-America_ are much upon a Par: So that\r\nwere they to accuse each other, it might be said of both,\r\n\r\n  _Clodius accusat Mæchos, Catalina Cethegos._\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless in other Respects there is a wide Difference between\r\nthem. For the Partizans of _America_ are actuated not only by\r\nSelf-Interest, or Vanity, but by Principles still more powerful, viz. By\r\nsuch a Spirit of Enthusiasm, and a Zeal bordering on Phrenzy, as will\r\nstick at nothing to promote the Good of the Cause. Hence therefore we may\r\nreasonably infer, that tho' the Entries for Exportation to every Country\r\nare somewhat exaggerated, yet that those to _North-America_ are doubly so.\r\nOther Traders may probably consider these puffing Advertisements [I mean\r\ntheir exaggerated Entries for Exportation] as a Kind of Peccadillos, very\r\nallowable for the Promotion of their Interest; but an _American_ Partizan\r\nviews them in a much higher Light, viz. as _meritorious Acts done for the\r\nGood of his Country_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have been hitherto comparing the Value of the _Exports_ to the\r\ntwelve _malcontent_ Provinces of _North-America_, with the Value of the\r\nExports to _Holland_ and _Germany_; let us in the next Place consider also\r\nthe Nature of the _North-American Imports_, if compared with those of\r\nother Countries.\r\n\r\nNow all Imports may be divided into two Classes, viz. Raw Materials for\r\nthe Employment of our own People, and taxable Objects for the Purposes of\r\nraising a Revenue.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the first of these,--if we should cast our Eyes on the\r\nImports from [10] _Russia_ only, will any one be so hardy as to maintain,\r\nthat the Imports from _North-America_ are at all on a Par with them, in\r\nany Respect whatever? Timber, for Example, Iron, Hemp, Flax and\r\nFlax-Seed, Linen-Yarn, Skins and Furrs, Ashes, Tallow, Hair, Bristles, &c.\r\n&c.;--Can it be pretended, with any Appearance of Truth, that the Imports\r\nof these Articles (taking one with another) from _North-America_, will\r\nbear any Comparison with those from _Russia_? And yet, to the Shame and\r\nDisgrace of an enlightened commercial State, several of these raw\r\nMaterials are taxed, if imported from _Russia_, in order to create a\r\nMonopoly to _North-America_: And others, when imported from _America_, are\r\nnot only allowed to be entered Duty-free, which is just enough; but also\r\nhave enjoyed for many Years the Benefit of large and munificent Bounties\r\ngiven by the Parliament of _Great-Britain_.--Given? To whom? To our\r\nnon-represented Colonies: For it seems they will condescend to receive\r\nBounties from us, tho' not represented, notwithstanding they make this\r\nvery Circumstance a Plea or Pretence against bearing any Share in our\r\nBurdens. However, all this is not sufficient to create that Monopoly in\r\ntheir Favour, which they, and their Adherents have long had in\r\nContemplation. For the Imports of Raw-Materials from _Russia_, which are\r\nevery Day encreasing, exceed those from _North-America_ in Goodness, in\r\nQuantity, in Value, and in every Respect, to a very great Degree.\r\n\r\nBut I forget: \"Pitch and Tar, and Indigo are also Raw-Materials of very\r\ngreat Consequence: And they are imported from _North-America_, but not\r\nfrom _Russia_.\" True: Pitch and Tar, if imported from _Russia_, would have\r\npaid an high Duty; but when brought from _America_, they receive a very\r\nlarge Bounty. And as to Indigo, had it not been for the many Hundred\r\nThousands of Pounds Sterling, which _Great-Britain_ has granted in\r\nBounties and Premiums to promote the Culture of this Article in the\r\n_Carolinas_ and _Virginia_, [a tenth Part of which Sum would have served\r\nfor the Cultivation of a better Sort on the Coast of _Africa_] I say, had\r\nit not been for this continual Fostering, and expensive Nursing, probably\r\nnot an Ounce of it would have been raised in _North-America_. And even as\r\nit is, the Indigo of _Carolina_, &c. is, generally speaking, of a Quality\r\nmuch inferior to that, which comes from other Countries. So much therefore\r\nas to Raw-Materials,--and let this suffice in respect to the grateful\r\nReturns of our Colonies towards us, for making so many impolitic\r\nrestraining Laws against ourselves, and for granting them so many\r\nMonopolies, and such extensive Bounties.\r\n\r\nThe next Head of Enquiry is, what _taxable Objects_ do we receive from\r\n_North-America_, if compared with the Taxables of other Countries? Mr.\r\nBURKE asserts Page 97, 2d Edit. \"That if _America_ gives us _taxable\r\nObjects_, on which we lay our Duties here, and gives us at the same Time,\r\na Surplus by a foreign Sale of her Commodities to pay the Duties on these\r\nObjects which we tax at Home, _she has performed her Part to the_ British\r\n_Revenue_.\"\r\n\r\nWell then, according to this Doctrine, we are first to suppose, that\r\n_North-America_ supplies us with great Quantities of taxable Objects;--and\r\nsecondly that by so doing, she hath performed her Part to the _British_\r\nRevenue; and therefore ought not to be obliged to contribute any further.\r\nNow I am so unhappy as to differ from the patriotic Orator in both these\r\nrespects; that is, I first deny his Premises;--and then 2dly, granting\r\neven his Premises, I cannot admit of his Conclusion. First, then I do\r\nmaintain, that _North-America_ doth not supply _Great-Britain_ with great\r\nQuantities of taxable Objects: For perhaps hardly any civilized Country in\r\nthe World, of equal Extent, and under the same Parallels of Latitude, is\r\nso barren in that Respect, as _North-America_.--At present, I can\r\nrecollect but two taxable Objects among all her Stores, viz. Rice and\r\nTobacco. In respect to Rice, I do allow that it hath been customary to tax\r\nit; but as it is a Raw-Material, and an Article of Food, it ought never to\r\nhave been taxed. And the Legislature hath done wisely at present in\r\nrepealing that Tax, which heretofore was laid on the home Consumption of\r\nit. The Fact is, that when Corn is dear, Rice becomes a good Succedaneum;\r\nbut when the former is cheap, the latter will not be used in any\r\nQuantities here in _England_: For _English_ Stomachs will never prefer\r\nRice to Wheat. In respect to that Rice, which is carried to the rest of\r\n_Europe_, it ought to be remembered, that it pays no Duty at all, if\r\nexported South of Cape _Finisterre_. And as to the Duty which is retained\r\non the Re-exportation of Rice to the Northward of Cape _Finistere_, it is\r\nso very trifling and inconsiderable, that it doth not deserve to be\r\nmentioned in a general and national View.\r\n\r\nIn regard to Tobacco; I admit it to be a very proper Object of Taxation.\r\nBut here again, that which is re-exported pays but little Duty, if any at\r\nall. And with respect to that which is used and consumed at Home, when the\r\nmany Frauds attending it, together with the Expence of collecting are\r\ntaken into the Account, the clear Balance will not be in any Degree, so\r\ngreat as is vulgarly imagined.\r\n\r\nBut granting, that this Branch of the Revenue is considerable, nay that it\r\nis _very_ considerable; yet there are a few unlucky Questions to be asked\r\non this Head, which it will puzzle Mr. BURKE and all his Adherents to\r\nanswer in such a Manner, as would do any Credit, or Service to their\r\nCause. For Example; has the _English_ Legislature done any Thing towards\r\nfavouring this _American_ Tobacco-Trade, and raising it up to its present\r\nHeight? Yes, it has; _England_ has granted a Monopoly to the _Americans_\r\nagainst herself, by severely prohibiting, in several Acts of Parliament,\r\nthe Cultivation of Tobacco in _England_: So that at the worst, we have one\r\nRemedy still in reserve, viz. the taking off this Prohibition, should the\r\n_Americans_ be so wrathfully-minded as to resolve never to sell us any\r\nmore Tobacco. On this Ground therefore I still proceed; and as the Friends\r\nof Mr. BURKE (if not he himself) are so very forward in exclaiming against\r\nthe Restraints and Hardships, under which they pretend, that _America_ has\r\nso long groaned;--I ask, why are they so totally silent concerning the\r\nmany Restraints and Discouragements, which _England_ also hath long and\r\npatiently suffered in order to enrich _America_? And where is the Candor,\r\nor Impartiality of such a Conduct? Again,--if we have granted the\r\n_Americans_ this Monopoly, in order to encrease their Trade, and so cause\r\ntheir Provinces to flourish; what Effects hath it produced, in regard to\r\nthe Sum Total of our own Revenue? And what is the Amount of the whole Duty\r\non Tobacco? Is it equal to the Duties paid on the simple Article of\r\nTea,--or of Wines and Brandies;--or in short of mere Fruit for our\r\nMince-Pies, and Plumb-Puddings, for our Tables and Deserts? No, by no\r\nMeans, it is not equal to any one of these _general_ Articles: For the\r\nDuty paid on the Importation of Fruit alone greatly surpasses it. And yet\r\nwe have granted no Monopolies, no Premiums, and no Bounties either to\r\n_China_, or to _France_, to _Spain_, _Portugal_, _Italy_, &c. &c. nor are\r\nthese Countries, to which we have so vast a Trade, and from which we draw\r\nso great a Revenue, ENGLISH COLONIES.\r\n\r\nBut nevertheless, I will now suppose, contrary to all Proof and Matters of\r\nFact, that the Revenue of the taxable Objects imported from\r\n_North-America_, was the greatest of all others;--what Inference is to be\r\ndrawn from this Concession? And doth it at all follow from such Premises,\r\nthat the _North-Americans_ must, or ought to enjoy all the Privileges of\r\n_Englishmen_, without contributing any Thing towards the general Support,\r\nmerely because we carry on an advantageous Trade with them, or have raised\r\na Tax on their Commodities? Surely no: For by the same Rule, we must unite\r\nand incorporate with, we must protect and defend, the _Chinese_, the\r\n_French_, the _Spaniards_, _Portuguese_, _Italians_, &c. &c. for the same\r\nReasons, and on the same Account. A Proposition this, which is too big\r\nwith Nonsense and Absurdity, to be seriously maintained.\r\n\r\nI will therefore dismiss the present Remark, with putting my Reader again\r\nin Mind, that let the Trade to _North-America_ be what it may, of little\r\nImportance, or otherwise; it is a mere begging the Question, and a most\r\n_disingenuous Artifice_ to insinuate (as all the Advocates for _America_\r\nnow do) that this Trade will be lost, if a Separation from the Colonies\r\nshould ensue. On the contrary, it is much more probable, that, when all\r\nParties shall be left at full Liberty to do as they please, our\r\n_North-American_ Trade will rather be encreased, than diminished by such a\r\nMeasure. Because it is Freedom, and not Confinement, or Monopoly, which\r\nencreases Trade. And sure I am that, on this Subject, History and past\r\nExperience, as well as Reason and Argument, are clearly on my Side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Case of Emigrations from _Germany_ and _Holland_, hath been in Part\r\nconsidered already: But as the continual Emigrations from _Great-Britain_\r\nand _Ireland_ (which I will always consider as _one_ Country) have\r\nsomething more particularly prejudicial in their Nature, if compared with\r\nothers, I hope the Reader will not think it lost Time, if I give them in\r\nthis Place a distinct Consideration.\r\n\r\nA Set of Labourers, or Tradesmen resided lately in _Great-Britain_, or\r\n_Ireland_; and earned their Bread by the Sweat of their Brows. Their\r\nnatural, or artificial Wants might be summed up under the three great, and\r\ncomprehensive Articles of Food, Rayment, and Dwelling. In respect to\r\n_Food_, including drinkables, as well as eatables, they paid for it by\r\ntheir Labour Wages; and consequently were the Means and of employing all\r\nthose different Trades both in Town and Country, which were concerned in,\r\nor connected with, the raising of Corn, or the rearing of Sheep and\r\nCattle, the making of Bread, Butter, Cheese, Malt, and Malt-Liquors,\r\nCyder, &c. &c. also in the fattening, killing, dressing, or preparing of\r\nFlesh, Fish, Fowl, &c. &c. and in the raising of all Sorts of\r\nGarden-Stuff, and other Eatables: The like might be observed in regard to\r\n_Rayment_, traced from the Raw-Material up to the perfect Manufacture, and\r\nincluding every Article of Dress, and all the Trades dependent on, and\r\nsupported by it, throughout all its Stages: _Dwelling_ is the last\r\nArticle; in which Estimate ought to be included not only the original\r\nMaterials for framing the Structure of the House, but also its successive\r\nRepairs; together with all Kinds of Household Goods from the highest to\r\nthe lowest Piece of Furniture, and their continual Wear and Tare.\r\n\r\nThese Persons, who have been thus useful to their Country, and have\r\ncontributed to its Trade and Riches, both by paying their own Rents and\r\nTaxes, and also by enabling others to pay theirs;--these Persons I say,\r\nhave been inveigled away to leave this Country, and to settle in\r\n_North-America_.--Here therefore I ask this plain Question, What\r\nRecompence can they possibly make in _America_, for the Loss which hath\r\nbeen occasioned by their leaving _England_? And what Gains will accrue to\r\nthe Mother-Country by this flourishing State of her Colonies? Begin\r\ntherefore wherever you please;--examine, I beseech you this Matter to the\r\nBottom, and mark the Consequences. _Food_ for Example, consisting of its\r\nvarious Kinds, and including eatables as well as drinkables, _common\r\nFood_, I say, must certainly be raised and manufactured on the Spot; for a\r\nMan cannot wait for his Dinner 'till it comes from _England_. Similar\r\nObservations will likewise extend to the chief Part of every Article\r\nrespecting _Rayment_ or Cloathing;--not forgetting also _Housing_ and\r\nFurniture. For in all these Respects, the principal Quantity, and the Bulk\r\nof the Goods, Manufactures, or Provisions must be procured from adjacent\r\nPlaces, and not from a Country 3000 Miles off. Perhaps indeed a few, a\r\nvery few Elegancies and Ornaments of Dress or Furniture, or of the\r\nDainties of the Table may still be imported from the Mother-Country. But\r\nalas! What are they, if compared with the Whole? Perhaps they would not\r\namount to more than a twentieth Part of the general Consumption.--And most\r\ncertain it is, that if these Emigrants should not settle near the\r\nSea-Coasts of _America_, but wander higher up the Country for Hundreds of\r\nMiles, in pursuit of fresh _unpatented_ Tracts of Land, (which most\r\nNew-comers are desirous of doing,) it would then not be a _fortieth_ Part\r\nof what they would have either used, consumed, or worn, had they still\r\nremained Inhabitants of _Great-Britain_ or _Ireland_: So little Cause hath\r\nthe Mother-Country to rejoice at this rapid Progress of the Population of\r\nher Colonies, arising from, or caused by, Emigrations.\r\n\r\nBut here, I know, it will be said, because it hath very often been said\r\nalready, \"That tho' these Emigrants might not employ as many Persons, or\r\nmechanic Trades here at Home, as they did before they left _England_; yet\r\nthey will employ more Shipping and Navigation, and consequently more\r\nSailors than heretofore; Sailors are the Defence, Sailors are the Bulwark\r\nof the Nation,\" &c. &c. Now in order to detect this Fallacy, as well as\r\nthe rest, I will here state a Case, which must open People's Eyes, if any\r\nThing can, respecting even the Articles of Seamen, Shipping, and\r\nNavigation.\r\n\r\nSuppose 1000 Tradesmen with their Families, Watch-Makers for Instance,\r\nsettled on one Spot somewhere in the Neighbourhood of _London_, [I only\r\nmention _Watch-Makers_, because it is computed, that about 1000 Families,\r\nor one-third of the City of _Geneva_ are supposed to be of that\r\nProfession.] Now the first Thing which would attract our Notice respecting\r\nNavigation, is to lay in a Provision of Sea-Coals; and a yearly Supply of\r\nthis Commodity for 1000 Families would employ a good deal of Shipping:\r\nFish would be the next Article, Sea-Fish especially, whether fresh or\r\nSalt, in respect to which a good many Sailors one Time or other must be,\r\nor must have been employed: After this, the like Observation will extend\r\nto Cyder, and to other Articles brought Coast-wise; also to Wines,\r\nBrandies, Rum, Sugars, Fruits, Oils, &c. &c. imported from Abroad:\r\nlikewise to Timber of various Kinds for building or repairing, also for\r\nmaking a Variety of Houshold Goods; to Iron, Hemp, Linen Cloth, and other\r\nCommodities, especially those of the bulky Kind: Now here I ask, Is it\r\npossible to conceive, that, were this Group of Manufacturers to take\r\nFlight, like a Swarm of Bees, and settle in some of the Towns or Provinces\r\nof _North-America_, they either would, or could employ as many _English_\r\nSeamen in their _new_ Situations, as they do at present in their _old_\r\nones? And can any Man be so absurd as to maintain such a Paradox?\r\n[Remember I limit the Matter to _English_ Seamen only; for as to\r\n_Americans_, let their Number be what it may, _Great-Britain_ never was\r\nadvantaged by them. Not to mention, that several of the _American_\r\nProvinces have disputed, or rather denied, long before the present\r\nDisturbances began, the Right of pressing Sailors for the Navy; though it\r\nis well known, that this is the only Method whereby a Navy can be manned;\r\nand though that eminent Whig, that upright, learned, and truly-patriotic\r\nLawyer [Judge FOSTER] hath demonstratively proved in his Law-Tracts this\r\nRight to be as legally and constitutionally vested in the Crown, as any\r\nRight whatever.]\r\n\r\nI will therefore take this Point relating to Sailors for granted; [at\r\nleast 'till the contrary shall be proved,] and then it will follow, that\r\n_British_ or _Irish_ Emigrations are to be considered as being very\r\nunfavourable to the Increase of _English_ Sailors, as well as of _English_\r\nManufacturers; and that the Loss and Detriment to the Mother-Country are\r\nvery great in both Respects.\r\n\r\nBut here a Difficulty of another Kind, and from a different Quarter, will\r\nprobably arise. It is this:--Granting that Emigrations are bad Things in\r\nall Respects;--granting that they tend to diminish the Number of your\r\nSailors, as well as of your Manufacturers; yet how can you prevent this\r\nEvil? And what Remedy do you propose for curing the People of that Madness\r\nwhich has seized them for Emigrations?--I answer:--Even the Remedy which\r\nhath been so often, and all along proposed, _A Total Separation from\r\nNorth-America_. For most certain it is, that as soon as such a Separation\r\nshall take Place, a Residence in the Colonies will be no longer a\r\ndesirable Situation. Nay, it is much more probable, that many of those who\r\nare already settled there, will wish to fly away, than that others should\r\ncovet to go to them. And indeed we begin to find this Observation not a\r\nlittle verified at present, a considerable Re-emigration (if I may use the\r\nTerm) having already taken Place. In short, when the _English_\r\nGovernment, which was the only Center of Union, and the only Bond of\r\nPeace, shall be removed, Faction will rise up against Faction, Congress\r\nagainst Congress, and Colony against Colony; and then the Southern\r\nProvinces will find to their Cost, that they have been egregiously duped\r\nand bubbled by the Northern; then they will perceive, that they have no\r\nother Alternative, but either to submit to the tyrannical Usurpations of\r\nthose _canting, hypocritical Republicans_, whom they used both to hate and\r\ndespise; or else to implore that Help, Defence, and Protection of the\r\nParent-State, which they now so wantonly and ungratefully reject and\r\noppose:--In either of these Situations, and under such Circumstances,\r\nthere is no Reason to fear, that many of our People will flock to\r\n_North-America_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrejudices and Prepossessions are stubborn Things in all Cases; but in\r\nnone more peculiarly obstinate, than in relinquishing detached Parts of an\r\nunwieldy, extended Empire; there not being, I believe, a single Instance\r\nin all History, of any Nation surrendering a distant Province voluntarily,\r\nand of free Choice, notwithstanding it was greatly their Interest to have\r\ndone it. The _English_ in particular have given remarkable Proofs of their\r\nUnwillingness. For tho' it was undeniably their Interest to have abandoned\r\nall the Provinces which they held in _France_, yet they never gave up one\r\nof them, 'till they were compelled to it by Force of Arms. Now indeed, and\r\nat this Distance of Time, we see clearly, that our Fore-Fathers were\r\nwretched Politicians in endeavouring to retain any one of the _French_\r\nProvinces, which, if it was a little one, would be a continual Drain, and\r\nperhaps an encreasing Expence; and if it was a great one, might grow up to\r\nbe a Rival, and become the Seat of Empire. I say, we can see these Things\r\nclearly enough at present: Yet alas! what Advantages do we derive from\r\nthis Discovery? And what Application do we make of such historical\r\n_Mementos_ to the Business of the present Day? The remotest of our\r\nProvinces in _France_ were hardly 300 Miles distant from our own Coasts;\r\nthe nearest of those in _America_ are about 3000. The Provinces in\r\n_France_ were already fully peopled, and peopled for the most Part by\r\nInhabitants extremely well affected at that Time to the _English_\r\nGovernment: Whereas the Deserts of _America_ require first to be peopled\r\nby Draughts either from ourselves, or from our _European_ Customers; and\r\nthen when these Emigrants have been settled for a Generation or two, they\r\nbecome native _Americans_, who naturally forget the Supremacy of that\r\nCountry, with whose Government they have so little Connections, from whose\r\nSeat of Empire they are so far distant, whose ruling Power they so seldom\r\nfeel (and therefore do not regard) and consequently whose Claims they\r\nconsider as so many audacious Attempts to rob them of their beloved\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nBut this is not all: And the Absurdity of our present Conduct in not\r\nabandoning the _rebellious_ Provinces of _North-America_, becomes still\r\nmore glaring, when we consider farther, (what we now find by Experience to\r\nbe true) that we can live and flourish, even in our commercial Capacity,\r\nwithout the Assistance of these refractory Colonies. For tho' it doth by\r\nno Means follow, that we should be destitute of their Trade, if each\r\n_American_ Province was erected into a separate and independent State;\r\nnay, tho' the contrary hath been made to appear by such a Chain of\r\nEvidences, as no Man hitherto hath attempted to break or weaken, yet,\r\ngranting the worst, granting even that these _North-Americans_ traded with\r\nus as little after a Separation as they do at present, still it is\r\npossible that we may then live, because it is certain we do now live\r\nwithout them; and do not only live, but also enjoy as many of the Comforts\r\nand Elegancies, not to mention the Profusions and Luxuries of Life, as any\r\nNation ever did, and more than we ourselves did heretofore.\r\n\r\nTherefore (to be more particular on this Head, for surely it is a most\r\nimportant one) we were gravely told, that as soon as ever the _Americans_\r\nshould shut their Ports against us, Famine to our Manufacturers,\r\nBankruptcy to our Merchants, Destruction and Desolation to our Seaport\r\nTowns must inevitably ensue. Well, the _Americans_ have now shut their\r\nPorts for a considerable Time against the Admission of _English_\r\nManufactures. And what has ensued? Nothing, that I know of, so very\r\ndismal, or so very tragical; and none of those _black_ and _bitter_ Days,\r\nwith which we were threatened, have yet appeared. Nay, according to the\r\nAccounts received from the principal manufacturing Places and Districts\r\nthroughout the Kingdom, it uniformly appears that Trade was never brisker\r\nin most Articles; and that it is not remarkably dead in any:--Moreover it\r\nis likewise certain, from the same Accounts, that a much greater\r\nStagnation hath been frequently felt, even at Times when every Port in\r\n_America_ was open to us, than is felt at present.\r\n\r\nHowever, if these Partizans of _America_ should cavil at these Accounts,\r\nand dispute their Authority, we have others yet to produce, which surely\r\nmust carry Conviction (almost in Spite of Prejudice) as soon as they are\r\nperused; [unless indeed it can be imagined, that the present wicked\r\nMinistry have entered into a Plot to charge themselves Debtors to the\r\nPublic for almost TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY-FIVE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLING\r\n_more than they received_, merely to plague and confound the poor\r\nPatriots.]\r\n\r\nThe Account I am now going to lay before the Reader, is the gross Produce\r\nfor the Year 1775, ending at the 5th of _July_ last, compared with the\r\nlike gross Produce of the preceding Year 1774, ending at the like Period.\r\n\r\n                                           £.       _s. d._\r\n\r\n  Gross Produce of the Year 1775,       5,479,695    7 10\r\n  Gross Produce of the Year 1774,       5,224,899    7 10-1/4\r\n\r\n  Increased Produce of the Year 1775,     254,795   19 11-3/4\r\n\r\nNow it appears by the Particulars of the Account, that what chiefly caused\r\nthis great Increase, was the greater Quantity made, consumed, or used of\r\nLow Wines and Spirits,--of the _London_ Brewery,--of Malt, Hops, Cyder,\r\nand Coaches, in the Year 1775, ending at the 5th of _July_, than in the\r\npreceding Year. For as to several other Articles, there was a remarkable\r\nDeficiency, especially in the Excise on Tea, and on Liquors imported into\r\nthe [11] Out-Ports; both which Branches, if put together, amount to no\r\nless than 79,380_l._ 13_s._ 9-1/2_d._--And yet, notwithstanding this great\r\nLoss in two such capital Articles, the Produce of the others before\r\nmentioned so much exceeded their usual Income, that the whole Balance of\r\nthe Year was, as I said before, 254,795_l._ 19_s._ 11-3/4_d._ Now as our\r\ncommon People, our Artificers, and mechanic Tradesmen, our Journeymen,\r\nDay-Labourers, &c. &c. are the principal Consumers of, or Customers for,\r\nthese Articles (Coaches excepted) we may, and ought to pronounce, that\r\nthese numerous Bodies of Men were not in that starving Condition, (which\r\nit was foretold they should be) when they could so much exceed their usual\r\n(and for the most Part _unnecessary_) Gratifications in Spirituous\r\nLiquors, and Porter, Ale, strong Beer, and Cyder, as to raise such a\r\nSurplus of Revenue. And in respect to the Increase in the Coach-Tax (which\r\nwas nearly 2000_l._) surely this is a plain Proof likewise, that our\r\nMerchants, principal Traders, and Manufacturers (who were all to be\r\ninfallibly ruined) are not in that melancholly Situation, as hath been\r\nforeboded of them by the _American_ false Prophets;--I say, the Proof is\r\nplain, seeing that so many new Carriages have been set up, instead of the\r\nformer being put down. And I think, I may take for granted, that it is the\r\nTrading, and not the Landed-Interest, which sets up most new Carriages.\r\n\r\nUpon the Whole therefore, and in whatever Light things are considered, it\r\nevidently appears that we can have but little, or nothing to lose; but\r\nmust have a great deal to get, or (which is the same thing) much to save,\r\nand many Dangers to escape by a total Separation from the rebellious\r\nProvinces of _North-America_. The History of all Nations, and of all\r\nAges,--our own Experience respecting _France_,--the melancholly Situation\r\nat this Day of the once populous and flourishing Kingdom of _Spain_,--the\r\npresent Demands of our Manufactures for Exportation,--the State of\r\nParties among us, and the Growth of republican Principles, all, all\r\nconspire to prove, that we ought to get rid of such an onerous, dangerous,\r\nand expensive Connection as soon as possible. In one Word, the longer the\r\npresent System is persevered in, the worse Things will necessarily grow,\r\nand the riper for Destruction; it being morally impossible that they\r\nshould mend; for the Fire, if even smothered for the present, will break\r\nout again with fresh Violence; and the sound Parts of our Constitution\r\nwill be in great Danger of being tainted by the Gangrene of _American_\r\nRepublicism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a Note at the Bottom of Page 52, (2d. Edition) of my Letter to Mr.\r\nBURKE, I expressed myself in the following Manner: \"The Instances which\r\nMr. BURKE has brought, [at Pages 74 and 75 of his Speech, 2d. Edit. 8vo.]\r\nto prove that the Colonies, or rather that a few out of the many Colonies,\r\nhave been liberal in their Grants to _Great-Britain_, during the\r\nContinuance of a privateering, smuggling, trucking, and huckstering\r\n_American_ Sea-War, in which they were sure to be the greatest Gainers,\r\nshall be particularly considered in an ensuing Treatise, An Address to the\r\nLanded Interest of _Great-Britain_ and _Ireland_.\"\r\n\r\nThe Minutes which I took at that Time relative to this Affair, and which I\r\nintended to have inserted in the Body of this Treatise, were the\r\nfollowing, that the leading Men in the Government of the Province of\r\n_Massachusets_, had, some Time before their famous Expedition against\r\n_Cape Breton_, been guilty of certain Mal-Practices in the Administration\r\nof public Affairs, for which they were in Danger of being called to an\r\nAccount. That in order to divert the Storm, and to throw a Barrel to the\r\nWhale, they projected the Plan of an Expedition, knowing the Temper of the\r\n_English_, and their Rage for Conquests. Therefore, hearing that the\r\nFortifications of _Cape Breton_ were very ruinous, and the Garrison both\r\nweak and mutinous for Want of Pay, Cloathing, and Provisions, they bent\r\ntheir Forces against this Place. The Scheme succeeded, and _Cape Breton_\r\nwas yielded up; but the Joy of the _English_ Nation knew no Bounds: For\r\nthe People, from the highest to the lowest, were so intoxicated with\r\nNotions of the Importance of this Port, [tho' now it is evident, that it\r\nis a very useless one if compared with others] that they forgot every\r\nother Idea in the general Transport; so that the Planners and Conductors\r\nof the Expedition, instead of their being called to an Account for their\r\nformer Misdemeanors, found themselves caressed and applauded by the whole\r\nNation; and to crown all, the Parliament itself voted a prodigious Sum of\r\nMoney to reimburse the _New-Englanders_ for their Expences, and their\r\nServices in this glorious Work.\r\n\r\nThis, I say, or to this Effect, was the Account which I received;--and\r\nwhich I believe in my own Mind, will be found to be for the most Part very\r\ntrue, when it can be very thoroughly _examined into_. But as I have been\r\nhurried, by the _early_ Meeting of Parliament, to publish the present\r\nTreatise at least three Months sooner than intended, I cannot at present\r\n_authenticate_ Facts and Dates in the Manner I wish to do, in an Affair of\r\nsuch Importance. Therefore I give this public Notice, that I build nothing\r\non the present Narration; and I only offer it (because not corroborated by\r\nsufficient Evidence) as a probable Case, and as my own Opinion.\r\n\r\nIndeed I have a particular Reason for acting in this cautious Manner;\r\nseeing that I have suffered already by making a Slip in an Affair of this\r\nNature, which in any other Cause or Controversy, would have been reckoned\r\nto be a very _venial_ one. The Case was this: In the First Edition of my\r\nFourth Tract, I had accused Dr. FRANKLIN with having acted a very\r\ndisingenuous Part, in opposing and denying the Authority of the _British_\r\nParliament, to lay a Tax [the Stamp-Duty] on _America_, when he himself\r\nhad solicited to be employed as an Agent in the Collection of that very\r\nTax. In Letters which passed between us, he denied the Charge, asserting\r\nfirst, that he did not make Interest for a Place in the Stamp-Office,\r\n'till the Bill was passed into a Law;--And 2dly. that the Place, for which\r\nhe asked, was not for himself, but for a Friend, one Mr. HUGHES, who was\r\naccordingly appointed by Mr. GRENVILLE. Now in Consequence of this\r\nInformation, I omitted in the next Edition, the whole Paragraph, and said\r\nnothing, either _pro_, or _con_, particularly relative to Dr. FRANKLIN.\r\nAnd surely, every Thing considered, and the _faux pas_ of Dr. FRANKLIN\r\nconcerning the _stolen_ Papers of Mr. WHEATLEY duly weighed, one would\r\nhave thought, that I had made Satisfaction fully sufficient to almost any\r\nMan in such a Case, whose Pretensions to _nice_ Honour might have been\r\nmuch better founded than those of Dr. FRANKLIN. But it seems, I was\r\nmistaken: For before he left _England_, I was called on in Print, to make\r\nReparation to his much injured Character: And in his Absence, his Agents\r\nand Confederates, the Monthly Reviewers, have done the same.\r\n\r\nHere therefore, I appeal to the Public, whether I have not advanced as far\r\nalready in this Affair, as there was need for me to have done, supposing\r\neven (which is supposing a great deal) that every Thing which Dr. FRANKLIN\r\nsaid was strictly true: For granting that he did not solicit for that\r\nPlace in particular, yet it is a most undeniable Fact, that at the very\r\nInstant when he was declaiming at the Bar of the House of Commons, against\r\nthe Authority of Parliament, he himself was an _American_ Revenue Officer,\r\nin a very lucrative Post, created by parliamentary Authority: He was a\r\nPost-Master General in _North-America_; and the Tax, which he collected,\r\nand for which he was accountable, was an _internal_, as well as _external_\r\nTax. So that in short, in every, or in any Light, his Conduct was not of\r\nthe spotless Kind; nor was my Accusation of Disingenuity against him the\r\nless true, whether he had solicited a Place in the Stamp-Office, or not.\r\n\r\nWhile I am writing this,--a Paragraph, cut out of a News-Paper, and dated\r\nfrom _Salisbury_, _October_ 15, is laid before me, which I am positively\r\ntold, is reckoned to be UNANSWERABLE. Now I have known so many of these\r\nUNANSWERABLES to shrink to nothing, when examined with any due Care and\r\nAttention, that I own I am not much frightened at the Appearance of this\r\nnew _American_ GOLIAH. However, let us approach this formidable Champion a\r\nlittle nearer.\r\n\r\n\"The _Americans_, says the News-Writer, in their Addresses to the Public,\r\nurge as a Reason against Parliamentary Taxation, the _great Disadvantages_\r\nthey incur by submitting to such numerous Restrictions in Trade, which\r\nthey deem a Burden equal to, if not greater than Taxation: And they also\r\nestimate, that that Mode of contributing to the Support of the _English_\r\nNation, is, upon the whole, more beneficial than if they were to pay their\r\nShare by being equally taxed with the Subjects of the Mother Country: But\r\nto be obliged to submit to those numerous Restraints in Trade, and at the\r\nsame Time to be subject to a parliamentary Taxation, they think is the\r\nhighest Degree of Oppression.\r\n\r\n\"The _Irish_ submit to parliamentary Restraints in Trade; but then, in\r\nreturn, they are exempted from Taxation. Why then should the _Americans_\r\nbe burdened with both, in similar Circumstances?\"\r\n\r\nHere the whole Matter of Complaint is reduced to two Heads; First, That\r\nthe _Americans_ by being restrained in their Trade, are thereby in Effect\r\ntaxed, and therefore ought not be taxed a second Time:\r\n\r\nAnd 2dly, That this Hardship seems to be the more oppressive, because the\r\n_Irish_ under similar Circumstances, are exempted from Taxation.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the first Head, it is a mere _Begging of the Question_.\r\nFor I have proved beyond Contradiction, that the _Americans_ are not, in\r\n_Fact_ and _Reality_, restrained either in their Exports or Imports,\r\nexcept in a very few Articles; and that they now enjoy the very best\r\nMarket which _Europe_ can afford, see my 4th Tract, Page 202-209. I have\r\nproved also, that _Great-Britain_ hath restrained herself in Favour of\r\n_America_ in Articles of at least as great Value and Importance, as those\r\nin which she hath restrained _America_ in Favour of _Great-Britain_. See\r\nmore particularly my 3d Tract, Page 119,-121. Surely therefore these\r\nThings ought to have been taken into Consideration, and not to have been\r\npassed over, as if they had never been mentioned: And it is exceedingly\r\nunfair and disingenuous to remember every Thing which makes on one Side of\r\na Question, and to forget the rest.\r\n\r\n2dly, With respect to the other Head of Complaint, viz. That _Ireland_ is\r\nexempted from Taxation, while such extraordinary Efforts are made for\r\ntaxing _America_, I hope what follows will be as full an Answer to this\r\nComplaint, as what has been already given was to the former.\r\n\r\nFirst therefore, I observe, that with Respect to the Claim of the\r\nlegislative Authority, which the Parent State makes over _Ireland_ as well\r\nas _America_, both Countries are exactly on the same Footing: See the 7th\r\nand 8th of WM. III. C. 22, § 9.:--And also Lord ROCKINGHAM's Act itself,\r\nrespecting the Claims of the Mother-Country over _America_:--See likewise\r\nthe Declaratory Act of 6. GEO. I. C. 5, respecting _Ireland_.\r\n\r\n2dly. The Mother-Country hath not only asserted, but maintained her Claims\r\nalike over both Countries, in the Affair of laying a general Post-Tax on\r\nall Parts of the _British_ Empire; so that in this Respect likewise both\r\nCountries are on a Par.\r\n\r\nBut here I allow follows a wide Difference, which I will endeavour to\r\naccount for, viz. The _British_ Parliament never attempted to lay any\r\ninternal Tax, except the Post-Tax, on _Ireland_; whereas it is well known,\r\nthat the _British_ Parliament did attempt to lay an internal Tax on\r\n_America_.\r\n\r\nNow to account for this _seeming_ Partiality, I have the following Points\r\nto offer; and I intreat my Readers to attend particularly to them.\r\n\r\n1. Ireland never plunged us into any Wars since the Revolution; whereas\r\n_America_ hath involved us in two, the most bloody and expensive that ever\r\nthis Nation experienced; the last of which brought on a Debt of\r\n70,000,000l. Sterling, the Interest of which we are now paying.\r\n\r\n2. Ireland doth not drain us of any Sums of Money to support and maintain\r\nits civil and military Establishments; whereas _America_ drains us for\r\nthose Purposes of upwards 300,000l. annually.\r\n\r\n3. Ireland drains us of no Money, by Way of _Bounty_ on the Importation of\r\nher Goods, or natural Produce into this Kingdom; whereas _America_ hath\r\ndrained us of at least 1,000,000l. Sterling for Bounties on Pitch and Tar,\r\non Lumber, Indigo, &c. &c. within a few Years.\r\n\r\n4. Ireland is continually burthened with large Pensions, some to Princes\r\nof the Blood, some to other Persons, and some to flaming Patriots: For\r\neven Patriots will accept of Pensions if they can get them, and then\r\nexclaim most bitterly--O Liberty, O my Country! Whereas _America_ is\r\ntotally free from this Species of Taxation, as far as I am able to trace\r\nthe Matter.\r\n\r\nMany other Articles might have been enumerated, particularly the Restraint\r\nformerly laid upon the _Irish_ fishing on the Banks of _Newfoundland_, and\r\ntaken off only the last Session. But surely these are full enough; because\r\nthese, I hope, will sufficiently shew, that there ought to be a wide\r\nDifference put on, every Principle of Equity and Justice, between the Case\r\nof _Ireland_ and that of _America_; and that the two Countries are by no\r\nMeans in similar Circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhat is now to follow, is added at the Request of a foreign Nobleman,\r\nwhose good Sense and Penetration led him to discern, that a Crisis was\r\ncertainly approaching, in which the Fate of this Country will be\r\ndetermined; and therefore wished to know, what was the Strength of each\r\nParty, and the Amount of the Forces on either Side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A General Muster of the Forces\r\n  BOTH FOR AND AGAINST\r\n  The Present Government.\r\n\r\nPARTIES _for overturning the present Constitution, and for setting up\r\nsomething in its Stead, for which we have not yet a Name_.\r\n\r\n\r\n1st. The Idle and Dissolute among the common People are for throwing the\r\npresent System into Anarchy and Confusion. They have ardently wished these\r\nmany Years, for some Kind of levelling Scheme whereby they might enrich\r\nthemselves at the Cost of their Masters, and rob and plunder with\r\nImpunity. If Mr. WILKES, or any other modern Patriot can lead them into\r\nthis Path of Glory, they will joyfully follow such a Leader, and become\r\nhis devoted Fellow-Labourers, in the same good Work; but if not, they will\r\nforsake him with as little Ceremony as they have done some others, and\r\nlook out for a new Leader.\r\n\r\n2dly. That Species among the _Whigs_ which is properly _Republican_, is\r\nviolently for a Change of Government, suitable to such Principles; and\r\nthese Men are now become of some Consequence, not so much on the Score of\r\ntheir Numbers, as on Account of their enthusiastic Zeal, and of their\r\nbreaking through every Tye of Honour, Honesty, and Conscience, for\r\naccomplishing such Designs. Moreover, as they put on every Disguise; as\r\nthey forge, lye, falsify; as they use the Word Liberty merely as a Blind\r\nto conceal the Batteries they are erecting against it; and as they pretend\r\nto support and uphold the Constitution, at the very Instant they are\r\nplanning a Scheme to destroy it; their Designs are so much the more\r\ndangerous by appearing to fight under the same Banner with ourselves; and\r\nthe Wounds they give, are the more difficult of Cure, because they stab\r\nand assassinate under the Mask of Friendship, and therefore take their Aim\r\nthe better, and strike the deeper. In the former Plots and Conspiracies of\r\nthe _Jacobites_, their Aim and Intent were to dethrone the reigning\r\nFamily, and to replace another: The present Views of the Republicans,\r\nwhich they are incessantly pursuing by various Means, and almost\r\ncontradictory Measures, are, _to have no Throne at all_. Hence, by a\r\nComparison of the two Crimes, the Reader must judge, which is the\r\ngreatest, and the most repugnant to the _English_ Constitution.\r\n\r\n3dly. The Advocates for making _North-America_ independent of the\r\n_British_ Parliament must, if consistent with themselves, be for turning\r\nthe _British_ Constitution into something very different from what it is\r\nat present, or ever was; for the very Plea these Men use in regard to\r\n_North-America_ is, that Representation and Legislation (a very small Part\r\nof which is the Power of raising Taxes) must always go together; therefore\r\nas nineteen Parts in twenty of the People of _England_, and upwards of\r\nninety-nine Parts in an Hundred of the People of _Scotland_, are not\r\nqualified to be _Voters_, nor ever were, _be their Property ever so\r\ngreat_, that is (according to this new-fashioned Doctrine) are not\r\nrepresented in Parliament; it must inevitably follow, that a vast Majority\r\nof the Inhabitants of _Great-Britain_, as well as _British America_, have\r\na right to renounce their Allegiance to the present Government as soon as\r\nthey please, and to set up for Independence. For in Fact, according to the\r\ndangerous Principles now openly avowed, all this Multitude of Non-Electors\r\nowe no Subjection to that Legislature, and to those Powers, in the Choice\r\nor Continuance of which they were not consulted. They ought not to be\r\ncompelled to obey any Laws, which were made without their Consent, or\r\nPrivity; and more especially where they have no Representation, they ought\r\nnot to be subject to any Taxation.--So that being thus happily set free\r\nfrom all Coercion of Government, all Restraints of Law, and Burden of\r\nTaxes; and having learnt at last to assert those inherent and unalienable\r\nRights, which have been so long usurped, they are now restored to a State\r\nof the most perfect Freedom, and may either chuse another Form of\r\nGovernment, according to their own Fancy; or else live, as they can,\r\nwithout any Government at all. A blessed Specimen this of _patriotic\r\nLiberty_! A most comprehensive Bill of Rights! sure of overturning, if\r\ncarried into Execution, every Government, that either ever was, or ever\r\ncan be, proposed to the World.\r\n\r\n4thly. The honourable Society of the _Outs_ will go as great Lengths to\r\nthrow Things into Confusion as any Set of Men whatever; for as these\r\nPersons have no other End in View than to get into Power, and to share the\r\nEmoluments of the State among themselves and their Dependents, they will\r\nstick at no Measure, however unjust and unconstitutional, to compass this\r\nEnd: Nay, they will unsay the Things which they themselves had said in\r\nAdministration; they will blame those very Measures which they themselves\r\nhad planned and recommended; and, in short, they will do any Thing, and\r\nevery Thing, to raise the evil Spirit of Discord and Dissention, to bring\r\nthemselves in.\r\n\r\n_Lastly._ The Inconstant and Disappointed, those who love to fish in\r\ntroubled Waters, and those who, having spent their Fortunes, have nothing\r\nto lose, but may have a Chance to share in the Property of other Men by a\r\ngeneral Scramble; also the Desperate and Daring of every Denomination; all\r\nthese wish for some speedy Change in the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTIES _for preserving the present Constitution, and for keeping every\r\nThing in a quiet and peaceable Condition_.\r\n\r\n1st. The greatest Part of the Nobility and Gentry of the Kingdom; that is,\r\nalmost all those who have the greatest Property at Stake, and have the\r\nmost to lose.\r\n\r\n2dly. A vast Majority of the richest Merchants, and principal Traders and\r\nManufacturers throughout the Kingdom, are the warm Friends of Government:\r\nThe Exceptions on this Head are few, and very inconsiderable.\r\n\r\n3dly. The Clergy of the established Church are zealously attached to the\r\npresent happy Constitution, wishing to preserve, and to promote Peace on\r\nEarth, and Good-Will among Men: And in respect to the dissenting Clergy,\r\nthe most eminent and respectable (tho' it is to be feared, not the most\r\nnumerous) act in the same laudable Manner, and endeavour to make their\r\nPeople truly sensible of the many Blessings they enjoy under the Reign of\r\nhis present Majesty.\r\n\r\n4thly. The Proprietors and Stock-Holders in the public Funds will\r\nundoubtedly range on the Side of Government; because they can get nothing,\r\nbut must necessarily lose by the Convulsions of the State, and by the\r\nOverthrow of that Constitution, the Preservation of which is their\r\ngreatest Security.\r\n\r\n5thly. The whole Body of the learned Profession in the Law (Men who\r\nhave acquired their Knowledge of the Constitution from Authors of\r\na Cast very different from bawling, disappointed Patriots, or hungry\r\nPamphleteers;--these Men, I say) in general agree, that each Member of the\r\nHouse of Commons, tho' elected by one particular County, City, or Borough,\r\ndoth not represent that particular County, City, or Borough, in any\r\n_exclusive_ Sense; for he represents the whole Commons of the Realm, one\r\nPart, and one Individual as well as another. A Member chosen _by_ the\r\nCounty of _Middlesex_ is not chosen _for Middlesex_ exclusively, but for\r\nall the Subjects of the _British_ Empire; each of whom hath as\r\nconstitutional a Right to his Services, and may be as much affected by his\r\nparticular Conduct, and therefore has as much Right to _instruct_ him, as\r\nany Freeholder in the County of _Middlesex_: And he, on his Part, is\r\nbound by his Office to omit the _smaller_ Interest of the County of\r\n_Middlesex_, or of the _Middlesex Electors_, when standing in Competition\r\nwith the _greater_ Interests of his Fellow Subjects in _America_, or other\r\nPlaces:--So that in short, tho' some few only, perhaps not a fortieth\r\nPart, of the Inhabitants of the whole Island, have legal Votes for\r\nRepresentatives, all in general, both within the Island, and without it,\r\nare _virtually_ represented. That this is Fact and Law, that this ever was\r\nthe Constitution of the _British_ Empire, from the earliest Times down to\r\nthe present Day, is such an apparent Truth, that it cannot be denied.\r\nTherefore in this Sense it is true, and in _no other_, that every Member\r\nof the common Wealth is supposed to give his previous Consent to the\r\nmaking of those Laws, which he is afterwards bound to obey, and to the\r\nimposing of those Taxes which he is obliged to pay. Indeed upon this\r\nFooting (viz. of virtual Representation in some Cases, and of actual\r\nElection in others) a free and well-poised Government can stand, and be\r\nsupported; but it can be supported on no other:--Nay, the Government of\r\nthe _Massachusets-Bay_ itself, whenever this Colony shall become\r\nindependent of the Mother-Country, must then, as well as now, be supported\r\non this very Principle; that is to say, on the very Principle against\r\nwhich they so loudly clamour. And besides all this, the very same\r\nReasons, which induce the non-represented Subjects in _England_ to submit\r\nquietly and peaceably to the Payment of those Taxes, to which they have\r\nnot given their Consent by actual Representation, ought to induce the\r\n_Americans_ to acquiesce also; because, if the _American_ Trade is so\r\nvaluable, as reported, a _British_ Parliament cannot injure this Trade by\r\nany Mode of Taxation, without injuring the Merchants, the Manufacturers,\r\nand the Traders in general of _Great-Britain_; and thereby sinking the\r\nProfits of their own Estates, and the Rents of their own Lands and Houses.\r\n\r\n6thly. The whole legislative Power of the Kingdom will certainly support\r\ntheir own Authority, and not commit _Felo de se_ to please their Enemies.\r\nThey will not, they never can admit the Parliaments of _North-America_ to\r\nbe independent of them, or co-ordinate with themselves in the same State\r\nor Empire.\r\n\r\n7thly. The whole executive Power of the Kingdom is at present in the Hands\r\nof his Majesty, and of those who act in his Name, and by his Authority.\r\nThere the Constitution has placed it, and in no other Hands; nor is there\r\nthe least Probability that mobbing, huzzaing, furious Speeches, and\r\ninflammatory Libels, without Arms, Artillery, or Ammunition, and without\r\na Treasury, will be able to wrest the executive Power out of the Hands of\r\nthose who constitutionally enjoy it.\r\n\r\nAnd now upon this General Review and Muster of the Forces on the\r\nMalcontent, as well as the Government Side, let every one consider well\r\nwithin himself, what he ought to do at the present Crisis, as a\r\nconstitutional Patriot, an honest _Englishman_, a loyal Subject, and a\r\nprudent Man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nERRATA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  P. 19. l. 10. for _Cacus_ read _Polyphemus_.\r\n  P. 62. l. 17. after _Labour_ add _and_.\r\n  P. 62. l. 19. dele _and_.\r\n  P. 65. l. 8. before _Sailors_ add _and_.\r\n  P. 72. l. 21. after _Produce_ add _of the Excise_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[1] In the Year of the Rebellion 1745, and for many Years afterwards, the\r\n_London Evening Post_ (now a republican) was then a flaming _Jacobite\r\nPaper_: During which Period the Author of these Tracts had frequently the\r\nHonour of being abused by him, under the Character of a _low-church,\r\nfanatical, Oliverian Whig_. Once in particular (above 20 Years ago) he\r\nwas complimented in the high-flown Strain of _Josiah ben Tucker ben Judas\r\nIscariot_. The Times are now greatly altered; and so is the Tone of the\r\nAbuse. But the Author is perfectly resigned to these Vicissitudes of human\r\nAffairs: And he has no other Favour to ask of this, and of all his\r\nBrother-Scribblers, whether weekly or monthly, in Sheets, or in Pamphlets,\r\nthan that they would _never praise him_, because that, and that only, he\r\nshould look upon to be a _real Disgrace_. But it is not the _London\r\nEvening Post_ alone, who from a violent Jacobite has commenced a fierce\r\nRepublican. Many like Instances may be recollected. And indeed the\r\nTransition is natural enough; for if a Man can be so absurd as to think\r\nthat there is an _indefeasible_ Right in any one Family, when that Family\r\nbecomes _extinct_, he turns a Republican.\r\n\r\n[2] The late Dr. BUTLER, Bishop of _Bristol_, and afterwards of _Durham_\r\nhad a singular Notion respecting large Communities and public Bodies;--a\r\nNotion which perhaps is not altogether unapplicable to the present Case.\r\nHis Custom was, when at _Bristol_, to walk for Hours in his Garden in the\r\ndarkest Night, which the Time of the Year could afford; and I had\r\nfrequently the Honour to attend him. After walking some Time, he would\r\nstop suddenly, and ask the Question, \"What Security is there against the\r\n_Insanity_ of Individuals? The Physicians know of none: And as to Divines,\r\nwe have no Data either from Scripture, or Reason to go upon relative to\r\nthis Affair.\"--_True, my Lord, no Man has a Lease of his Understanding,\r\nany more than of his Life. They are both in the Hands of the Sovereign\r\nDisposer of all Things._ He would then take another Turn, and again stop\r\nshort. \"Why might not whole Communities and public Bodies be seized with\r\n_Fits of Insanity_, as well as Individuals?\" _My Lord, I have never\r\nconsidered the Case, and can give no Opinion concerning it._ \"Nothing but\r\nthis Principle, that they are liable to Insanity, equally at least with\r\nprivate Persons, can account for the major Part of those Transactions,\r\nwhich we read in History.\" I thought little of this odd Conceit of the\r\nBishop's at that Juncture: But I own I could not avoid thinking of it a\r\ngreat deal since, and applying it to many Cases.\r\n\r\n[3] See, for a Proof of this Fact, First, A Message from the General\r\nAssembly of _Massachusetts Bay_ to GOVERNOR SHIRLEY, 4th of _January_,\r\n1754. Secondly, A Message from the Council and House of Representatives of\r\nditto to ditto. Thirdly, An Address from the Council of Representatives of\r\nditto to ditto. Forthly, An Address of the Assembly of _Virginia_ to the\r\nKing. Fifthly, A Representation of the Commissioners met at _Albany_. And\r\nSixthly, Extracts from the Proceedings of the CONGRESS at _Albany_, all in\r\nthe Year 1754. And all of them antecedent to the Arrival of the two\r\nRegiments under GENERAL BRADDOCK. I would here recommend the Perusal of\r\n_The Controversy between_ Great Britain _and her Colonies_, printed for\r\nALMON, to those who wish for a fuller Information on these interesting\r\nPoints; particularly from Page 107 to 136.\r\n\r\n[4] Were it not for the _British_ Fleets, and for the Fortresses of\r\n_Gibraltar_ and _Port-Mahon_,--and in short for the general Terror of the\r\nBritish Name, all the piratical States of _Barbary_ would immediately\r\nseize on _American_ Ships, when carrying Fish, or Rice, or any other\r\n_American_ Produce South of Cape _Finistere_, as their lawful Prey. And\r\nyet _America_ doth not pay a single Shilling towards the Support of our\r\nFleets, or the Maintenance of our Forts and Garrisons in any Part of the\r\nWorld.\r\n\r\n[5] See the Resolutions of the grand Continental Congress, in Opposition\r\nto the reconciliatory Proposal of Parliament for permitting each Province\r\nto tax itself, according to its own Mode. In these Resolutions they\r\nexpressly declare, that they will be the sole Judges, not only of the\r\n_Mode_ of raising, but also of the Sum or Quantum to be raised, and of the\r\nApplication of it: And that the Parliament of _Great-Britain_ hath no\r\nRight to decide as to either of these Points.\r\n\r\n[6] The Princes of the House of STUART took it into their Heads to\r\nbelieve, that all Colonies were their private Patrimony; in respect of\r\nwhich the Parliament had no Right to intermeddle. This Notion, so long ago\r\njustly exploded, is now revived, (strange to tell!) even by modern\r\nPatriots, and _American_ Republicans: For they are the People at present,\r\nand not the King's Ministers, who propose to exalt the Prerogatives of the\r\nCrown to the Subversion of the Rights, Privileges, and Liberties of the\r\n_British_ Parliament, and the _British_ Nation. Indeed so far, it must be\r\nowned, is Fact,--that as the Princes of that House had the first modelling\r\nof the Colonies, they introduced a Practice, (still most absurdly retained\r\ntho' without any Power to enforce it) of bringing all Appeals before\r\nthemselves and their Privy Councils, instead of before the Court of\r\nKing's-Bench or the House of Lords; which is the only regular and\r\nconstitutional Mode of appealing, and the only one now observed in Appeals\r\nfrom _Ireland_. However, notwithstanding this _Impropriety_, as the King\r\ncan send no armed Forces to _America_, without Consent of Parliament first\r\nhad for their Maintenance, and afterwards for authorizing the Use of\r\nmilitary Law, and military Discipline among them, it may be justly\r\naverred, that the King doth in no other exclusive Sense govern _America_,\r\nthan as the sole executive Power, which is to enforce and put in Motion\r\nthe Laws and Decrees of the supreme Legislature of _Great-Britain_. See a\r\nvery candid and impartial Account of this Matter in a Book entituled,\r\n\"Remarks on the principal Acts of the 13th Parliament of _Great-Britain_,\"\r\nfrom Page 38 to 45.\r\n\r\n[7] See De LOLME's _Constitution of England_, the Note of Page 52. The\r\nwhole is a most excellent Treatise, and worthy the Perusal of all those\r\n_Englishmen_, who wish to understand, and to set a just Value on the\r\ndistinguishing Excellencies of the _English_ Constitution,--a\r\nConstitution, as he justly observes, the only one in its Kind, _ponderibus\r\nlibrata suis_.\r\n\r\n[8] See his Speech, _March_ 22, 1775, second Edition Octavo.\r\n\r\n[9] Queen ELIZABETH sometimes raised this Duty to 20 and 25 per Cent. by\r\nOrders and Warrants issued from her Privy Council; that is, by her own\r\nsole and absolute Authority. Yet she was _good Queen_ BESS: And her Days\r\nwere _golden Days_. See also the shocking Number of Monopolies granted in\r\nher Reign, set forth at large in TOWNSHEND's _Collection_; or in Sir SIMON\r\nd'EWE's _Journal_ of _Parliament_. See more particularly the Debates which\r\npast in the 43d Year of her Reign, after a Struggle of upwards of 20 Years\r\nfor abolishing these Monopolies.\r\n\r\n[10] A few shallow, half-sighted Politicians have objected to the Trade\r\nwith _Russia_, because the Balance, according to their narrow Ideas, is\r\nvisibly against us. But what Balance do they mean?--Not the Balance of\r\n_Industry_, for that is plainly in our Favour; or, in other Words, we\r\nexport more _manufactured_ Goods to _Russia_, than we receive from it. And\r\nas to the Balance of _Money_, they ought to have known, that it is much\r\nmore beneficial to an industrious, commercial Country to import\r\nRaw-Materials (_if it wants them_) than to import Gold and Silver; because\r\nthere cannot be so many Hands employed in the manufacturing of these\r\nMetals, as in the working up of Timber, Iron, Hemp, Flax, &c. &c. to their\r\nrespective Uses. It is amazing, how little these self-evident Principles\r\nhave been understood, or at least attended to by commercial Writers of\r\nsome Note and Character, and particularly by JOSIAH GEE; according to\r\nwhose Doctrine of the Balance of Trade, this Nation hath not been worth a\r\nsingle Shilling for almost these 100 Years.\r\n\r\n[11] I am told, that this Deficiency of the Excise this Year, on Liquors\r\nimported into the Out-Ports, is owing to a new Species of Smuggling lately\r\nput in Practice, whereby the Revenue is grossly defrauded. If so, the\r\nBalance would have been still greater, had all the Duties on Rum, and\r\nother Liquors imported into the Out-Ports, been justly and fairly paid; or\r\nat least paid as fairly and justly as usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lately published by the same Author_,\r\n\r\nTRACTS Political and Commercial.\r\n\r\n1. _A Solution of the important Question, whether a poor Country, where\r\nraw Materials and Provisions are cheap, and Wages low, can supplant the\r\nTrade of a rich manufacturing Country, where raw Materials and Provisions\r\nare dear, and the Price of Labour high._\r\n\r\n2. _The Case of going to War for the Sake of Trade considered in a new\r\nLight._\r\n\r\n3. _A Letter from a Merchant in_ London _to his Nephew in_ America,\r\n_concerning the late and present Disturbances in the Colonies._\r\n\r\n4. _The true Interest of_ Great-Britain _set forth in regard to the\r\nColonies; and the only Means of living in Peace and Harmony with them._\r\n\r\n5. _The respective Pleas and Arguments of the Mother Country and of the\r\nColonies distinctly set forth; and the Impossibility of a Compromise of\r\nDifferences, or a mutual Concession of Rights plainly demonstrated; with a\r\nprefatory Epistle to the Plenipotentiaries of the Congress._\r\n\r\nPrinted for RIVINGTON, CADEL, and WALTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRACTS Polemical and Theological.\r\n\r\n1. _An Apology for the Church of_ England, _as by Law established,\r\noccasioned by a Petition to Parliament for abolishing Subscriptions._\r\n\r\n2. _Two Letters to the Rev.
