A\r\nrising nation, spread over a wide and fruitful land, traversing all\r\nthe seas with the rich productions of their industry, engaged in\r\ncommerce with nations who feel power and forget right, advancing\r\nrapidly to destinies beyond the reach of mortal eye--when I\r\ncontemplate these transcendent objects, and see the honor, the\r\nhappiness, and the hopes of this beloved country committed to\r\nthe issue and the auspices of this day, I shrink from the contemplation,\r\nand humble myself before the magnitude of the undertaking.\r\nUtterly indeed, should I despair, did not the presence\r\nof many whom I here see remind me, that in the other high authorities\r\nprovided by our constitution, I shall find resources of\r\nwisdom, of virtue, and of zeal, on which to rely under all difficulties.\r\nTo you, then, gentlemen, who are charged with the\r\nsovereign functions of legislation, and to those associated with\r\nyou, I look with encouragement for that guidance and support\r\nwhich may enable us to steer with safety the vessel in which we\r\nare all embarked amid the conflicting elements of a troubled\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nDuring the contest of opinion through which we have passed,\r\nthe animation of discussion and of exertions has sometimes worn\r\nan aspect which might impose on strangers unused to think freely\r\nand to speak and to write what they think; but this being now\r\ndecided by the voice of the nation, announced according to the\r\nrules of the constitution, all will, of course, arrange themselves\r\nunder the will of the law, and unite in common efforts for the\r\ncommon good. All, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle,\r\nthat though the will of the majority is in all cases to prevail, that\r\nwill, to be rightful, must be reasonable; that the minority possess\r\ntheir equal rights, which equal laws must protect, and to\r\nviolate which would be oppression. Let us, then, fellow citizens,\r\nunite with one heart and one mind. Let us restore to social intercourse\r\nthat harmony and affection without which liberty and\r\neven life itself are but dreary things. And let us reflect that\r\nhaving banished from our land that religious intolerance under\r\nwhich mankind so long bled and suffered, we have yet gained\r\nlittle if we countenance a political intolerance as despotic, as\r\nwicked, and capable of as bitter and bloody persecutions. During\r\nthe throes and convulsions of the ancient world, during the\r\nagonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking through blood and\r\nslaughter his long-lost liberty, it was not wonderful that the agitation\r\nof the billows should reach even this distant and peaceful\r\nshore; that this should be more felt and feared by some and less\r\nby others; that this should divide opinions as to measures of\r\nsafety. But every difference of opinion is not a difference of\r\nprinciple. We have called by different names brethren of the\r\nsame principle. We are all republicans--we are federalists. If\r\nthere be any among us who would wish to dissolve this Union\r\nor to change its republican form, let them stand undisturbed as\r\nmonuments of the safety with which error of opinion may be\r\ntolerated where reason is left free to combat it. I know, indeed,\r\nthat some honest men fear that a republican government cannot\r\nbe strong; that this government is not strong enough. But\r\nwould the honest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment,\r\nabandon a government which has so far kept us free and firm,\r\non the theoretic and visionary fear that this government, the\r\nworld's best hope, may by possibility want energy to preserve itself?\r\nI trust not. I believe this, on the contrary, the strongest\r\ngovernment on earth. I believe it is the only one where every\r\nman, at the call of the laws, would fly to the standard of the\r\nlaw, and would meet invasions of the public order as his own\r\npersonal concern. Sometimes it is said that man cannot be\r\ntrusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be trusted\r\nwith the government of others? Or have we found angels in\r\nthe forms of kings to govern him? Let history answer this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, with courage and confidence pursue our own\r\nfederal and republican principles, our attachment to our union\r\nand representative government. Kindly separated by nature and\r\na wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one quarter of the\r\nglobe; too high-minded to endure the degradations of the others;\r\npossessing a chosen country, with room enough for our descendants\r\nto the hundredth and thousandth generation; entertaining a\r\ndue sense of our equal right to the use of our own faculties, to\r\nthe acquisitions of our industry, to honor and confidence from\r\nour fellow citizens, resulting not from birth but from our actions\r\nand their sense of them; enlightened by a benign religion, professed,\r\nindeed, and practiced in various forms, yet all of them including\r\nhonesty, truth, temperance, gratitude, and the love of\r\nman; acknowledging and adoring an overruling Providence,\r\nwhich by all its dispensations proves that it delights in the happiness\r\nof man here and his greater happiness hereafter; with all\r\nthese blessings, what more is necessary to make us a happy and\r\nprosperous people? Still one thing more, fellow citizens--a wise\r\nand frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring\r\none another, which shall leave them otherwise free to regulate\r\ntheir own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not\r\ntake from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned. This is\r\nthe sum of good government, and this is necessary to close the\r\ncircle of our felicities.\r\n\r\nAbout to enter, fellow citizens, on the exercise of duties which\r\ncomprehend everything dear and valuable to you, it is proper\r\nthat you should understand what I deem the essential principles\r\nof our government, and consequently those which ought to shape\r\nits administration. I will compress them within the narrowest\r\ncompass they will bear, stating the general principle, but not all\r\nits limitations. Equal and exact justice to all men, of whatever\r\nstate or persuasion, religious or political; peace, commerce, and\r\nhonest friendship, with all nations--entangling alliances with\r\nnone; the support of the state governments in all their rights, as\r\nthe most competent administrations for our domestic concerns\r\nand the surest bulwarks against anti-republican tendencies; the\r\npreservation of the general government in its whole constitutional\r\nvigor, as the sheet anchor of our peace at home and safety\r\nabroad; a jealous care of the right of election by the people--a\r\nmild and safe corrective of abuses which are lopped by the\r\nsword of the revolution where peaceable remedies are unprovided;\r\nabsolute acquiescence in the decisions of the majority--the\r\nvital principle of republics, from which there is no appeal but to\r\nforce, the vital principle and immediate parent of despotism; a\r\nwell-disciplined militia--our best reliance in peace and for the\r\nfirst moments of war, till regulars may relieve them; the supremacy\r\nof the civil over the military authority; economy in the public\r\nexpense, that labor may be lightly burdened; the honest payment\r\nof our debts and sacred preservation of the public faith;\r\nencouragement of agriculture, and of commerce as its handmaid;\r\nthe diffusion of information and the arraignment of all abuses at\r\nthe bar of public reason; freedom of religion; freedom of the\r\npress; freedom of person under the protection of the _habeas corpus_;\r\nand trial by juries impartially selected--these principles\r\nform the bright constellation which has gone before us, and\r\nguided our steps through an age of revolution and reformation.\r\nThe wisdom of our sages and the blood of our heroes have been\r\ndevoted to their attainment. They should be the creed of our\r\npolitical faith--the text of civil instruction--the touchstone by\r\nwhich to try the services of those we trust; and should we wander\r\nfrom them in moments of error or alarm, let us hasten to retrace\r\nour steps and to regain the road which alone leads to peace,\r\nliberty, and safety.\r\n\r\nI repair, then, fellow citizens, to the post you have assigned\r\nme. With experience enough in subordinate offices to have seen\r\nthe difficulties of this, the greatest of all, I have learned to expect\r\nthat it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfect man to retire from\r\nthis station with the reputation and the favor which bring him\r\ninto it. Without pretensions to that high confidence reposed in\r\nour first and great revolutionary character, whose preëminent\r\nservices had entitled him to the first place in his country's love,\r\nand destined for him the fairest page in the volume of faithful\r\nhistory, I ask so much confidence only as may give firmness and\r\neffect to the legal administration of your affairs. I shall often go\r\nwrong through defect of judgment. When right, I shall often be\r\nthought wrong by those whose positions will not command a\r\nview of the whole ground. I ask your indulgence for my own\r\nerrors, which will never be intentional; and your support against\r\nthe errors of others, who may condemn what they would not if\r\nseen in all its parts. The approbation implied by your suffrage\r\nis a consolation to me for the past; and my future solicitude will\r\nbe to retain the good opinion of those who have bestowed it in\r\nadvance, to conciliate that of others by doing them all the good\r\nin my power, and to be instrumental to the happiness and freedom\r\nof all.\r\n\r\nRelying, then, on the patronage of your good will, I advance\r\nwith obedience to the work, ready to retire from it whenever\r\nyou become sensible how much better choice it is in your power\r\nto make. And may that Infinite Power which rules the destinies\r\nof the universe, lead our councils to what is best, and give\r\nthem a favorable issue for your peace and prosperity.\r\n\r\n[In communicating his first message to Congress, President\r\nJefferson addressed the following letter to the presiding officer of\r\neach branch of the national legislature.]\r\n\r\n                                                      December 8, 1801.\r\n\r\nSIR: The circumstances under which we find ourselves placed\r\nrendering inconvenient the mode heretofore practised of making\r\nby personal address the first communication between the legislative\r\nand executive branches, I have adopted that by message, as\r\nused on all subsequent occasions through the session. In doing\r\nthis, I have had principal regard to the convenience of the legislature,\r\nto the economy of their time, to their relief from the embarrassment\r\nof immediate answers on subjects not yet fully before\r\nthem, and to the benefits thence resulting to the public affairs.\r\nTrusting that a procedure founded in these motives will\r\nmeet their approbation, I beg leave, through you, sir, to communicate\r\nthe enclosed message, with the documents accompanying it,\r\nto the honorable the senate, and pray you to accept, for yourself\r\nand them, the homage of my high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n_The Hon. the President of the Senate._\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST ANNUAL MESSAGE.--DECEMBER 8, 1801.\r\n\r\n_Fellow Citizens of the Senate and House of Representatives_:\r\n\r\nIt is a circumstance of sincere gratification to me that on\r\nmeeting the great council of our nation, I am able to announce\r\nto them, on the grounds of reasonable certainty, that the wars\r\nand troubles which have for so many years afflicted our sister\r\nnations have at length come to an end, and that the communications\r\nof peace and commerce are once more opening among them.\r\nWhile we devoutly return thanks to the beneficent Being who\r\nhas been pleased to breathe into them the spirit of conciliation\r\nand forgiveness, we are bound with peculiar gratitude to be\r\nthankful to him that our own peace has been preserved through\r\nso perilous a season, and ourselves permitted quietly to cultivate\r\nthe earth and to practice and improve those arts which tend to\r\nincrease our comforts. The assurances, indeed, of friendly disposition,\r\nreceived from all the powers with whom we have principal\r\nrelations, had inspired a confidence that our peace with\r\nthem would not have been disturbed. But a cessation of the\r\nirregularities which had affected the commerce of neutral nations,\r\nand of the irritations and injuries produced by them, cannot but\r\nadd to this confidence; and strengthens, at the same time, the\r\nhope, that wrongs committed on unoffending friends, under a\r\npressure of circumstances, will now be reviewed with candor,\r\nand will be considered as founding just claims of retribution for\r\nthe past and new assurance for the future.\r\n\r\nAmong our Indian neighbors, also, a spirit of peace and friendship\r\ngenerally prevails; and I am happy to inform you that the\r\ncontinued efforts to introduce among them the implements and\r\nthe practice of husbandry, and of the household arts, have not\r\nbeen without success; that they are becoming more and more\r\nsensible of the superiority of this dependence for clothing and\r\nsubsistence over the precarious resources of hunting and fishing;\r\nand already we are able to announce, that instead of that constant\r\ndiminution of their numbers, produced by their wars and\r\ntheir wants, some of them begin to experience an increase of\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nTo this state of general peace with which we have been\r\nblessed, one only exception exists. Tripoli, the least considerable\r\nof the Barbary States, had come forward with demands\r\nunfounded either in right or in compact, and had permitted itself\r\nto denounce war, on our failure to comply before a given\r\nday. The style of the demand admitted but one answer. I\r\nsent a small squadron of frigates into the Mediterranean, with\r\nassurances to that power of our sincere desire to remain in peace,\r\nbut with orders to protect our commerce against the threatened\r\nattack. The measure was seasonable and salutary. The bey\r\nhad already declared war in form. His cruisers were out. Two\r\nhad arrived at Gibraltar. Our commerce in the Mediterranean\r\nwas blockaded, and that of the Atlantic in peril. The arrival\r\nof our squadron dispelled the danger. One of the Tripolitan\r\ncruisers having fallen in with, and engaged the small schooner\r\nEnterprise, commanded by Lieutenant Sterret, which had gone as\r\na tender to our larger vessels, was captured, after a heavy slaughter\r\nof her men, without the loss of a single one on our part.\r\nThe bravery exhibited by our citizens on that element, will, I\r\ntrust, be a testimony to the world that it is not the want of that\r\nvirtue which makes us seek their peace, but a conscientious desire\r\nto direct the energies of our nation to the multiplication of\r\nthe human race, and not to its destruction. Unauthorized by\r\nthe constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond\r\nthe line of defence, the vessel being disabled from committing\r\nfurther hostilities, was liberated with its crew. The legislature\r\nwill doubtless consider whether, by authorizing measures of\r\noffence, also, they will place our force on an equal footing with\r\nthat of its adversaries. I communicate all material information\r\non this subject, that in the exercise of the important function\r\nconfided by the constitution to the legislature exclusively, their\r\njudgment may form itself on a knowledge and consideration of\r\nevery circumstance of weight.\r\n\r\nI wish I could say that our situation with all the other Barbary\r\nstates was entirely satisfactory. Discovering that some delays\r\nhad taken place in the performance of certain articles stipulated\r\nby us, I thought it my duty, by immediate measures for\r\nfulfilling them, to vindicate to ourselves the right of considering\r\nthe effect of departure from stipulation on their side. From the\r\npapers which will be laid before you, you will be enabled to\r\njudge whether our treaties are regarded by them as fixing at all\r\nthe measure of their demands, or as guarding from the exercise\r\nof force our vessels within their power; and to consider how far\r\nit will be safe and expedient to leave our affairs with them in\r\ntheir present posture.\r\n\r\nI lay before you the result of the census lately taken of our\r\ninhabitants, to a conformity with which we are to reduce the\r\nensuing rates of representation and taxation. You will perceive\r\nthat the increase of numbers during the last ten years, proceeding\r\nin geometrical ratio, promises a duplication in little more\r\nthan twenty-two years. We contemplate this rapid growth, and\r\nthe prospect it holds up to us, not with a view to the injuries it\r\nmay enable us to do to others in some future day, but to the settlement\r\nof the extensive country still remaining vacant within\r\nour limits, to the multiplications of men susceptible of happiness,\r\neducated in the love of order, habituated to self-government, and\r\nvaluing its blessings above all price.\r\n\r\nOther circumstances, combined with the increase of numbers,\r\nhave produced an augmentation of revenue arising from consumption,\r\nin a ratio far beyond that of population alone, and\r\nthough the changes of foreign relations now taking place so desirably\r\nfor the world, may for a season affect this branch of\r\nrevenue, yet, weighing all probabilities of expense, as well as of\r\nincome, there is reasonable ground of confidence that we may\r\nnow safely dispense with all the internal taxes, comprehending\r\nexcises, stamps, auctions, licenses, carriages, and refined sugars,\r\nto which the postage on newspapers may be added, to facilitate\r\nthe progress of information, and that the remaining sources of\r\nrevenue will be sufficient to provide for the support of government,\r\nto pay the interest on the public debts, and to discharge\r\nthe principals in shorter periods than the laws or the general expectations\r\nhad contemplated. War, indeed, and untoward\r\nevents, may change this prospect of things, and call for expenses\r\nwhich the imposts could not meet; but sound principles will not\r\njustify our taxing the industry of our fellow citizens to accumulate\r\ntreasure for wars to happen we know not when, and which\r\nmight not perhaps happen but from the temptations offered by\r\nthat treasure.\r\n\r\nThese views, however, of reducing our burdens, are formed\r\non the expectation that a sensible, and at the same time a salutary\r\nreduction, may take place in our habitual expenditures.\r\nFor this purpose, those of the civil government, the army, and\r\nnavy, will need revisal.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that this government is charged with the\r\nexternal and mutual relations only of these states; that the states\r\nthemselves have principal care of our persons, our property, and\r\nour reputation, constituting the great field of human concerns,\r\nwe may well doubt whether our organization is not too complicated,\r\ntoo expensive; whether offices and officers have not been\r\nmultiplied unnecessarily, and sometimes injuriously to the service\r\nthey were meant to promote. I will cause to be laid before\r\nyou an essay toward a statement of those who, under public employment\r\nof various kinds, draw money from the treasury or\r\nfrom our citizens. Time has not permitted a perfect enumeration,\r\nthe ramifications of office being too multiplied and remote\r\nto be completely traced in a first trial. Among those who are\r\ndependent on executive discretion, I have begun the reduction\r\nof what was deemed necessary. The expenses of diplomatic\r\nagency have been considerably diminished. The inspectors of\r\ninternal revenue who were found to obstruct the accountability\r\nof the institution, have been discontinued. Several agencies\r\ncreated by executive authority, on salaries fixed by that also,\r\nhave been suppressed, and should suggest the expediency of\r\nregulating that power by law, so as to subject its exercises to\r\nlegislative inspection and sanction. Other reformations of the\r\nsame kind will be pursued with that caution which is requisite\r\nin removing useless things, not to injure what is retained. But\r\nthe great mass of public offices is established by law, and,\r\ntherefore, by law alone can be abolished. Should the legislature\r\nthink it expedient to pass this roll in review, and try all its parts\r\nby the test of public utility, they may be assured of every aid\r\nand light which executive information can yield. Considering\r\nthe general tendency to multiply offices and dependencies,\r\nand to increase expense to the ultimate term of burden which\r\nthe citizen can bear, it behooves us to avail ourselves of every\r\noccasion which presents itself for taking off the surcharge; that\r\nit never may be seen here that, after leaving to labor the smallest\r\nportion of its earnings on which it can subsist, government\r\nshall itself consume the residue of what it was instituted to\r\nguard.\r\n\r\nIn our care, too, of the public contributions intrusted to our\r\ndirection, it would be prudent to multiply barriers against their\r\ndissipation, by appropriating specific sums to every specific purpose\r\nsusceptible of definition; by disallowing all applications of\r\nmoney varying from the appropriation in object, or transcending it\r\nin amount; by reducing the undefined field of contingencies, and\r\nthereby circumscribing discretionary powers over money; and\r\nby bringing back to a single department all accountabilities for\r\nmoney where the examination may be prompt, efficacious, and\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nAn account of the receipts and expenditures of the last year,\r\nas prepared by the secretary of the treasury, will as usual be laid\r\nbefore you. The success which has attended the late sales of\r\nthe public lands, shows that with attention they may be made an\r\nimportant source of receipt. Among the payments, those made\r\nin discharge of the principal and interest of the national debt,\r\nwill show that the public faith has been exactly maintained.\r\nTo these will be added an estimate of appropriations necessary\r\nfor the ensuing year. This last will of course be effected by\r\nsuch modifications of the systems of expense, as you shall think\r\nproper to adopt.\r\n\r\nA statement has been formed by the secretary of war, on mature\r\nconsideration, of all the posts and stations where garrisons\r\nwill be expedient, and of the number of men requisite for each\r\ngarrison. The whole amount is considerably short of the present\r\nmilitary establishment. For the surplus no particular use\r\ncan be pointed out. For defence against invasion, their number\r\nis as nothing; nor is it conceived needful or safe that a standing\r\narmy should be kept up in time of peace for that purpose. Uncertain\r\nas we must ever be of the particular point in our circumference\r\nwhere an enemy may choose to invade us, the only force\r\nwhich can be ready at every point and competent to oppose\r\nthem, is the body of neighboring citizens as formed into a militia.\r\nOn these, collected from the parts most convenient, in\r\nnumbers proportioned to the invading foe, it is best to rely, not\r\nonly to meet the first attack, but if it threatens to be permanent,\r\nto maintain the defence until regulars may be engaged to relieve\r\nthem. These considerations render it important that we should\r\nat every session continue to amend the defects which from time\r\nto time show themselves in the laws for regulating the militia,\r\nuntil they are sufficiently perfect. Nor should we now or at any\r\ntime separate, until we can say we have done everything for the\r\nmilitia which we could do were an enemy at our door.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of military stores on hand will be laid before\r\nyou, that you may judge of the additions still requisite.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the extent to which our naval preparations\r\nshould be carried, some difference of opinion may be expected to\r\nappear; but just attention to the circumstances of every part of\r\nthe Union will doubtless reconcile all. A small force will probably\r\ncontinue to be wanted for actual service in the Mediterranean.\r\nWhatever annual sum beyond that you may think\r\nproper to appropriate to naval preparations, would perhaps be\r\nbetter employed in providing those articles which may be kept\r\nwithout waste or consumption, and be in readiness when any\r\nexigence calls them into use. Progress has been made, as will\r\nappear by papers now communicated, in providing materials for\r\nseventy-four gun ships as directed by law.\r\n\r\nHow far the authority given by the legislature for procuring\r\nand establishing sites for naval purposes has been perfectly understood\r\nand pursued in the execution, admits of some doubt. A\r\nstatement of the expenses already incurred on that subject, shall\r\nbe laid before you. I have in certain cases suspended or slackened\r\nthese expenditures, that the legislature might determine\r\nwhether so many yards are necessary as have been contemplated.\r\nThe works at this place are among those permitted to go on;\r\nand five of the seven frigates directed to be laid up, have been\r\nbrought and laid up here, where, besides the safety of their position,\r\nthey are under the eye of the executive administration, as\r\nwell as of its agents, and where yourselves also will be guided\r\nby your own view in the legislative provisions respecting them\r\nwhich may from time to time be necessary. They are preserved\r\nin such condition, as well the vessels as whatever belongs to\r\nthem, as to be at all times ready for sea on a short warning.\r\nTwo others are yet to be laid up so soon as they shall have received\r\nthe repairs requisite to put them also into sound condition.\r\nAs a superintending officer will be necessary at each\r\nyard, his duties and emoluments, hitherto fixed by the executive,\r\nwill be a more proper subject for legislation. A communication\r\nwill also be made of our progress in the execution of the law respecting\r\nthe vessels directed to be sold.\r\n\r\nThe fortifications of our harbors, more or less advanced, present\r\nconsiderations of great difficulty. While some of them are\r\non a scale sufficiently proportioned to the advantages of their\r\nposition, to the efficacy of their protection, and the importance\r\nof the points within it, others are so extensive, will cost so much\r\nin their first erection, so much in their maintenance, and require\r\nsuch a force to garrison them, as to make it questionable what is\r\nbest now to be done. A statement of those commenced or projected,\r\nof the expenses already incurred, and estimates of their\r\nfuture cost, so far as can be foreseen, shall be laid before you,\r\nthat you may be enabled to judge whether any attention is necessary\r\nin the laws respecting this subject.\r\n\r\nAgriculture, manufactures, commerce, and navigation, the four\r\npillars of our prosperity, are the most thriving when left most\r\nfree to individual enterprise. Protection from casual embarrassments,\r\nhowever, may sometimes be seasonably interposed. If in\r\nthe course of your observations or inquiries they should appear to\r\nneed any aid within the limits of our constitutional powers, your\r\nsense of their importance is a sufficient assurance they will occupy\r\nyour attention. We cannot, indeed, but all feel an anxious solicitude\r\nfor the difficulties under which our carrying trade will\r\nsoon be placed. How far it can be relieved, otherwise than by\r\ntime, is a subject of important consideration.\r\n\r\nThe judiciary system of the United States, and especially that\r\nportion of it recently erected, will of course present itself to the\r\ncontemplation of Congress; and that they may be able to judge\r\nof the proportion which the institution bears to the business it\r\nhas to perform, I have caused to be procured from the several\r\nStates, and now lay before Congress, an exact statement of all\r\nthe causes decided since the first establishment of the courts, and\r\nof those which were depending when additional courts and\r\njudges were brought in to their aid.\r\n\r\nAnd while on the judiciary organization, it will be worthy\r\nyour consideration, whether the protection of the inestimable institution\r\nof juries has been extended to all the cases involving the\r\nsecurity of our persons and property. Their impartial selection\r\nalso being essential to their value, we ought further to consider\r\nwhether that is sufficiently secured in those States where they\r\nare named by a marshal depending on executive will, or designated\r\nby the court or by officers dependent on them.\r\n\r\nI cannot omit recommending a revisal of the laws on the\r\nsubject of naturalization. Considering the ordinary chances of\r\nhuman life, a denial of citizenship under a residence of fourteen\r\nyears is a denial to a great proportion of those who ask it, and\r\ncontrols a policy pursued from their first settlement by many of\r\nthese States, and still believed of consequence to their prosperity.\r\nAnd shall we refuse the unhappy fugitives from distress that hospitality\r\nwhich the savages of the wilderness extended to our\r\nfathers arriving in this land? Shall oppressed humanity find no\r\nasylum on this globe? The constitution, indeed, has wisely\r\nprovided that, for admission to certain offices of important trust,\r\na residence shall be required sufficient to develop character and\r\ndesign. But might not the general character and capabilities of\r\na citizen be safely communicated to every one manifesting a\r\n_bonâ fide_ purpose of embarking his life and fortunes permanently\r\nwith us? with restrictions, perhaps, to guard against the fraudulent\r\nusurpation of our flag; an abuse which brings so much\r\nembarrassment and loss on the genuine citizen, and so much\r\ndanger to the nation of being involved in war, that no endeavor\r\nshould be spared to detect and suppress it.\r\n\r\nThese, fellow citizens, are the matters respecting the state of\r\nthe nation, which I have thought of importance to be submitted\r\nto your consideration at this time. Some others of less moment,\r\nor not yet ready for communication, will be the subject of separate\r\nmessages. I am happy in this opportunity of committing\r\nthe arduous affairs of our government to the collected wisdom\r\nof the Union. Nothing shall be wanting on my part to inform,\r\nas far as in my power, the legislative judgment, nor to carry that\r\njudgment into faithful execution. The prudence and temperance\r\nof your discussions will promote, within your own walls,\r\nthat conciliation which so much befriends rational conclusion;\r\nand by its example will encourage among our constituents that\r\nprogress of opinion which is tending to unite them in object and\r\nin will. That all should be satisfied with any one order of things\r\nis not to be expected, but I indulge the pleasing persuasion that\r\nthe great body of our citizens will cordially concur in honest and\r\ndisinterested efforts, which have for their object to preserve the\r\ngeneral and State governments in their constitutional form and\r\nequilibrium; to maintain peace abroad, and order and obedience\r\nto the laws at home; to establish principles and practices of administration\r\nfavorable to the security of liberty and property, and\r\nto reduce expenses to what is necessary for the useful purposes\r\nof government.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND ANNUAL MESSAGE.--DECEMBER 15, 1802.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nWhen we assemble together, fellow citizens, to consider the\r\nstate of our beloved country, our just attentions are first drawn\r\nto those pleasing circumstances which mark the goodness of that\r\nBeing from whose favor they flow, and the large measure of\r\nthankfulness we owe for his bounty. Another year has come\r\naround, and finds us still blessed with peace and friendship\r\nabroad; law, order, and religion, at home; good affection and\r\nharmony with our Indian neighbors; our burdens lightened, yet\r\nour income sufficient for the public wants, and the produce of\r\nthe year great beyond example. These, fellow citizens, are the\r\ncircumstances under which we meet; and we remark with special\r\nsatisfaction, those which, under the smiles of Providence, result\r\nfrom the skill, industry and order of our citizens, managing their\r\nown affairs in their own way and for their own use, unembarrassed\r\nby too much regulations, unoppressed by fiscal exactions.\r\n\r\nOn the restoration of peace in Europe, that portion of the general\r\ncarrying trade which had fallen to our share during the\r\nwar, was abridged by the returning competition of the belligerent\r\npowers. This was to be expected, and was just. But in addition\r\nwe find in some parts of Europe monopolizing discriminations,\r\nwhich, in the form of duties, tend effectually to prohibit\r\nthe carrying thither our own produce in our own vessels. From\r\nexisting amities, and a spirit of justice, it is hoped that friendly\r\ndiscussion will produce a fair and adequate reciprocity. But\r\nshould false calculations of interest defeat our hope, it rests with\r\nthe legislature to decide whether they will meet inequalities\r\nabroad with countervailing inequalities at home, or provide for\r\nthe evil in any other way.\r\n\r\nIt is with satisfaction I lay before you an act of the British\r\nparliament anticipating this subject so far as to authorize a mutual\r\nabolition of the duties and countervailing duties permitted\r\nunder the treaty of 1794. It shows on their part a spirit of justice\r\nand friendly accommodation which it is our duty and our\r\ninterest to cultivate with all nations. Whether this would produce\r\na due equality in the navigation between the two countries,\r\nis a subject for your consideration.\r\n\r\nAnother circumstance which claims attention, as directly affecting\r\nthe very source of our navigation, is the defect or the\r\nevasion of the law providing for the return of seamen, and particularly\r\nof those belonging to vessels sold abroad. Numbers of\r\nthem, discharged in foreign ports, have been thrown on the\r\nhands of our consuls, who, to rescue them from the dangers into\r\nwhich their distresses might plunge them, and save them to their\r\ncountry, have found it necessary in some cases to return them at\r\nthe public charge.\r\n\r\nThe cession of the Spanish province of Louisiana to France,\r\nwhich took place in the course of the late war, will, if carried\r\ninto effect, make a change in the aspect of our foreign relations\r\nwhich will doubtless have a just weight in any deliberations of\r\nthe legislature connected with that subject.\r\n\r\nThere was reason, not long since, to apprehend that the warfare\r\nin which we were engaged with Tripoli might be taken up\r\nby some others of the Barbary powers. A reinforcement, therefore,\r\nwas immediately ordered to the vessels already there.\r\nSubsequent information, however, has removed these apprehensions\r\nfor the present. To secure our commerce in that sea with\r\nthe smallest force competent, we have supposed it best to watch\r\nstrictly the harbor of Tripoli. Still, however, the shallowness\r\nof their coast, and the want of smaller vessels on our part, has\r\npermitted some cruisers to escape unobserved; and to one of\r\nthese an American vessel unfortunately fell a prey. The captain,\r\none American seamen, and two others of color, remain\r\nprisoners with them unless exchanged under an agreement formerly\r\nmade with the bashaw, to whom, on the faith of that, some\r\nof his captive subjects had been restored.\r\n\r\nThe convention with the State of Georgia has been ratified\r\nby their legislature, and a repurchase from the Creeks has been\r\nconsequently made of a part of the Tallahassee county. In this\r\npurchase has been also comprehended part of the lands within\r\nthe fork of Oconee and Oakmulgee rivers. The particulars of\r\nthe contract will be laid before Congress so soon as they shall be\r\nin a state for communication.\r\n\r\nIn order to remove every ground of difference possible with\r\nour Indian neighbors, I have proceeded in the work of settling\r\nwith them and marking the boundaries between us. That with\r\nthe Choctaw nation is fixed in one part, and will be through the\r\nwhole in a short time. The country to which their title had\r\nbeen extinguished before the revolution is sufficient to receive a\r\nvery respectable population, which Congress will probably see\r\nthe expediency of encouraging so soon as the limits shall be declared.\r\nWe are to view this position as an outpost of the United\r\nStates, surrounded by strong neighbors and distant from its\r\nsupport. And how far that monopoly which prevents population\r\nshould here be guarded against, and actual habitation made\r\na condition of the continuance of title, will be for your consideration.\r\nA prompt settlement, too, of all existing rights and\r\nclaims within this territory, presents itself as a preliminary operation.\r\n\r\nIn that part of the Indian territory which includes Vincennes,\r\nthe lines settled with the neighboring tribes fix the extinction\r\nof their title at a breadth of twenty-four leagues from east to\r\nwest, and about the same length parallel with and including the\r\nWabash. They have also ceded a tract of four miles square, including\r\nthe salt springs near the mouth of the river.\r\n\r\nIn the department of finance it is with pleasure I inform you\r\nthat the receipts of external duties for the last twelve months\r\nhave exceeded those of any former year, and that the ratio of\r\nincrease has been also greater than usual. This has enabled us\r\nto answer all the regular exigencies of government, to pay from\r\nthe treasury in one year upward of eight millions of dollars,\r\nprincipal and interest, of the public debt, exclusive of upward\r\nof one million paid by the sale of bank stock, and making in\r\nthe whole a reduction of nearly five millions and a half of\r\nprincipal; and to have now in the treasury four millions and a\r\nhalf of dollars, which are in a course of application to a further\r\ndischarge of debt and current demands. Experience, too,\r\nso far, authorizes us to believe, if no extraordinary event supervenes,\r\nand the expenses which will be actually incurred shall\r\nnot be greater than were contemplated by Congress at their last\r\nsession, that we shall not be disappointed in the expectations\r\nthen formed. But nevertheless, as the effect of peace on the\r\namount of duties is not yet fully ascertained, it is the more\r\nnecessary to practice every useful economy, and to incur no expense\r\nwhich may be avoided without prejudice.\r\n\r\nThe collection of the internal taxes having been completed in\r\nsome of the States, the officers employed in it are of course out\r\nof commission. In others, they will be so shortly. But in a\r\nfew, where the arrangement for the direct tax had been retarded,\r\nit will still be some time before the system is closed. It has not\r\nyet been thought necessary to employ the agent authorized by\r\nan act of the last session for transacting business in Europe relative\r\nto debts and loans. Nor have we used the power confided\r\nby the same act, of prolonging the foreign debts by reloans, and\r\nof redeeming, instead thereof, an equal sum of the domestic\r\ndebt. Should, however, the difficulties of remittances on so\r\nlarge a scale render it necessary at any time, the power shall be\r\nexecuted, and the money thus unemployed abroad shall, in conformity\r\nwith that law, be faithfully applied here in an equivalent\r\nextinction of domestic debt. When effects so salutary result\r\nfrom the plans you have already sanctioned, when merely by\r\navoiding false objects of expense we are able, without a direct\r\ntax, without internal taxes, and without borrowing, to make large\r\nand effectual payments toward the discharge of our public debt\r\nand the emancipation of our posterity from that moral canker, it\r\nis an encouragement, fellow citizens, of the highest order, to\r\nproceed as we have begun, in substituting economy for taxation,\r\nand in pursuing what is useful for a nation placed as we are,\r\nrather than what is practiced by others under different circumstances.\r\nAnd whensoever we are destined to meet events which\r\nshall call forth all the energies of our countrymen, we have the\r\nfirmest reliance on those energies, and the comfort of leaving\r\nfor calls like these the extraordinary resources of loans and internal\r\ntaxes. In the meantime, by payments of the principal of\r\nour debt, we are liberating, annually, portions of the external\r\ntaxes, and forming from them a growing fund still further to\r\nlessen the necessity of recurring to extraordinary resources.\r\n\r\nThe usual accounts of receipts and expenditures for the last\r\nyear, with an estimate of the expenses of the ensuing one, will\r\nbe laid before you by the secretary of the treasury.\r\n\r\nNo change being deemed necessary in our military establishment,\r\nan estimate of its expenses for the ensuing year on its\r\npresent footing, as also of the sums to be employed in fortifications\r\nand other objects within that department, has been prepared\r\nby the secretary of war, and will make a part of the general\r\nestimates which will be presented to you.\r\n\r\nConsidering that our regular troops are employed for local purposes,\r\nand that the militia is our general reliance for great and\r\nsudden emergencies, you will doubtless think this institution\r\nworthy of a review, and give it those improvements of which\r\nyou find it susceptible.\r\n\r\nEstimates for the naval department, prepared by the secretary\r\nof the navy for another year, will in like manner be communicated\r\nwith the general estimates. A small force in the Mediterranean\r\nwill still be necessary to restrain the Tripoline cruisers,\r\nand the uncertain tenure of peace with some other of the Barbary\r\npowers, may eventually require that force to be augmented.\r\nThe necessity of procuring some smaller vessels for that service\r\nwill raise the estimate, but the difference in their maintenance\r\nwill soon make it a measure of economy.\r\n\r\nPresuming it will be deemed expedient to expend annually a\r\nsum towards providing the naval defence which our situation\r\nmay require, I cannot but recommend that the first appropriations\r\nfor that purpose may go to the saving what we already possess.\r\nNo cares, no attentions, can preserve vessels from rapid decay\r\nwhich lie in water and exposed to the sun. These decays require\r\ngreat and constant repairs, and will consume, if continued, a\r\ngreat portion of the money destined to naval purposes. To\r\navoid this waste of our resources, it is proposed to add to our\r\nnavy-yard here a dock, within which our vessels may be laid up\r\ndry and under cover from the sun. Under these circumstances\r\nexperience proves that works of wood will remain scarcely at all\r\naffected by time. The great abundance of running water which\r\nthis situation possesses, at heights far above the level of the tide,\r\nif employed as is practised for lock navigation, furnishes the\r\nmeans of raising and laying up our vessels on a dry and sheltered\r\nbed. And should the measure be found useful here, similar depositories\r\nfor laying up as well as for building and repairing vessels\r\nmay hereafter be undertaken at other navy-yards offering the\r\nsame means. The plans and estimates of the work, prepared\r\nby a person of skill and experience, will be presented to you\r\nwithout delay; and from this it will be seen that scarcely more\r\nthan has been the cost of one vessel is necessary to save the\r\nwhole, and that the annual sum to be employed toward its completion\r\nmay be adapted to the views of the legislature as to naval\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nTo cultivate peace and maintain commerce and navigation in\r\nall their lawful enterprises; to foster our fisheries and nurseries\r\nof navigation and for the nurture of man, and protect the manufactures\r\nadapted to our circumstances; to preserve the faith of\r\nthe nation by an exact discharge of its debts and contracts, expend\r\nthe public money with the same care and economy we\r\nwould practise with our own, and impose on our citizens no unnecessary\r\nburden; to keep in all things within the pale of our\r\nconstitutional powers, and cherish the federal union as the only\r\nrock of safety--these, fellow-citizens, are the landmarks by\r\nwhich we are to guide ourselves in all our proceedings. By continuing\r\nto make these our rule of action, we shall endear to our\r\ncountrymen the true principles of their constitution, and promote\r\na union of sentiment and of action equally auspicious to their\r\nhappiness and safety. On my part, you may count on a cordial\r\nconcurrence in every measure for the public good, and on\r\nall the information I possess which may enable you to discharge\r\nto advantage the high functions with which you are invested by\r\nyour country.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--JANUARY 28, 1802.[1]\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:--\r\n\r\nI lay before you the accounts of our Indian trading houses,\r\nas rendered up to the first day of January, 1801, with a report\r\nof the secretary of war thereon, explaining the effects and the\r\nsituation of that commerce, and the reasons in favor of its farther\r\nextension. But it is believed that the act authorizing this trade\r\nexpired so long ago as the 3d of March, 1799. Its revival, therefore,\r\nas well as its extension, is submitted to the consideration of\r\nthe legislature.\r\n\r\nThe act regulating trade and intercourse with the Indian\r\ntribes will also expire on the 3d day of March next. While on\r\nthe subject of its continuance, it will be worthy the consideration\r\nof the legislature, whether the provisions of the law inflicting\r\non Indians, in certain cases, the punishment of death by\r\nhanging, might not permit its commutation into death by military\r\nexecution, the form of the punishment in the former way\r\nbeing peculiarly repugnant to their ideas, and increasing the obstacles\r\nto the surrender of the criminal.\r\n\r\nThese people are becoming very sensible of the baneful effects\r\nproduced on their morals, their health and existence, by the\r\nabuse of ardent spirits, and some of them earnestly desire a prohibition\r\nof that article from being carried among them. The\r\nlegislature will consider whether the effectuating that desire\r\nwould not be in the spirit of benevolence and liberality which\r\nthey have hitherto practised toward these our neighbors, and\r\nwhich has had so happy an effect toward conciliating their\r\nfriendship. It has been found too, in experience, that the same\r\nabuse gives frequent rise to incidents tending much to commit\r\nour peace with the Indians.\r\n\r\nIt is now become necessary to run and mark the boundaries\r\nbetween them and us in various parts. The law last mentioned\r\nhas authorized this to be done, but no existing appropriation\r\nmeets the expense.\r\n\r\nCertain papers, explanatory of the grounds of this communication,\r\nare herewith enclosed.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [1] See Confidential Message recommending a Western Exploring\r\n        Expedition in Appendix, p. 241 of this volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--FEBRUARY 24, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and House of Representatives_:--\r\n\r\nI lay before you a report of the secretary of state on the case\r\nof the Danish brigantine Henrick, taken by a French privateer\r\nin 1799, retaken by an armed vessel of the United States, carried\r\ninto a British island and there adjudged to be neutral, but under\r\nan allowance of such salvage and costs as absorbed nearly the\r\nwhole amount of sales of the vessel and cargo. Indemnification\r\nfor these losses, occasioned by our officers, is now claimed\r\nby the sufferers, supported by the representation of their government.\r\nI have no doubt the legislature will give to the subject\r\nthat just attention and consideration which it is useful as well as\r\nhonorable to practise in our transactions with other nations, and\r\nparticularly with one which has observed toward us the most\r\nfriendly treatment and regard.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD ANNUAL MESSAGE.--OCTOBER 17, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nIn calling you together, fellow citizens, at an earlier day than\r\nwas contemplated by the act of the last session of Congress, I\r\nhave not been insensible to the personal inconveniences necessarily\r\nresulting from an unexpected change in your arrangements.\r\nBut matters of great public concernment have rendered this call\r\nnecessary, and the interest you feel in these will supersede in\r\nyour minds all private considerations.\r\n\r\nCongress witnessed, at their last session, the extraordinary agitation\r\nproduced in the public mind by the suspension of our right\r\nof deposit at the port of New Orleans, no assignment of another\r\nplace having been made according to treaty. They were sensible\r\nthat the continuance of that privation would be more injurious\r\nto our nation than any consequences which could flow\r\nfrom any mode of redress, but reposing just confidence in the\r\ngood faith of the government whose officer had committed the\r\nwrong, friendly and reasonable representations were resorted to,\r\nand the right of deposit was restored.\r\n\r\nPrevious, however, to this period, we had not been unaware\r\nof the danger to which our peace would be perpetually exposed\r\nwhile so important a key to the commerce of the western country\r\nremained under foreign power. Difficulties, too, were presenting\r\nthemselves as to the navigation of other streams, which,\r\narising within our territories, pass through those adjacent. Propositions\r\nhad, therefore, been authorized for obtaining, on fair\r\nconditions, the sovereignty of New Orleans, and of other possessions\r\nin that quarter interesting to our quiet, to such extent as was\r\ndeemed practicable; and the provisional appropriation of two\r\nmillions of dollars, to be applied and accounted for by the president\r\nof the United States, intended as part of the price, was considered\r\nas conveying the sanction of Congress to the acquisition\r\nproposed. The enlightened government of France saw, with\r\njust discernment, the importance to both nations of such liberal\r\narrangements as might best and permanently promote the peace,\r\nfriendship, and interests of both; and the property and sovereignty\r\nof all Louisiana, which had been restored to them, have on certain\r\nconditions been transferred to the United States by instruments\r\nbearing date the 30th of April last. When these shall\r\nhave received the constitutional sanction of the senate, they will\r\nwithout delay be communicated to the representatives also, for\r\nthe exercise of their functions, as to those conditions which are\r\nwithin the powers vested by the constitution in Congress. While\r\nthe property and sovereignty of the Mississippi and its waters secure\r\nan independent outlet for the produce of the western States,\r\nand an uncontrolled navigation through their whole course, free\r\nfrom collision with other powers and the dangers to our peace\r\nfrom that source, the fertility of the country, its climate and extent,\r\npromise in due season important aids to our treasury, an\r\nample provision for our posterity, and a wide-spread field for the\r\nblessings of freedom and equal laws.\r\n\r\nWith the wisdom of Congress it will rest to take those ulterior\r\nmeasures which may be necessary for the immediate occupation\r\nand temporary government of the country; for its incorporation\r\ninto our Union; for rendering the change of government a blessing\r\nto our newly-adopted brethren; for securing to them the\r\nrights of conscience and of property; for confirming to the Indian\r\ninhabitants their occupancy and self-government, establishing\r\nfriendly and commercial relations with them, and for ascertaining\r\nthe geography of the country acquired. Such materials\r\nfor your information, relative to its affairs in general, as the short\r\nspace of time has permitted me to collect, will be laid before you\r\nwhen the subject shall be in a state for your consideration.\r\n\r\nAnother important acquisition of territory has also been made\r\nsince the last session of Congress. The friendly tribe of Kaskaskia\r\nIndians with which we have never had a difference, reduced\r\nby the wars and wants of savage life to a few individuals\r\nunable to defend themselves against the neighboring tribes, has\r\ntransferred its country to the United States, reserving only for its\r\nmembers what is sufficient to maintain them in an agricultural\r\nway. The considerations stipulated are, that we shall extend\r\nto them our patronage and protection, and give them certain annual\r\naids in money, in implements of agriculture, and other articles\r\nof their choice. This country, among the most fertile\r\nwithin our limits, extending along the Mississippi from the\r\nmouth of the Illinois to and up the Ohio, though not so necessary\r\nas a barrier since the acquisition of the other bank, may yet\r\nbe well worthy of being laid open to immediate settlement, as\r\nits inhabitants may descend with rapidity in support of the lower\r\ncountry should future circumstances expose that to foreign enterprize.\r\nAs the stipulations in this treaty also involve matters\r\nwithin the competence of both houses only, it will be laid before\r\nCongress as soon as the senate shall have advised its ratification.\r\n\r\nWith many other Indian tribes, improvements in agriculture\r\nand household manufacture are advancing, and with all our\r\npeace and friendship are established on grounds much firmer\r\nthan heretofore. The measure adopted of establishing trading\r\nhouses among them, and of furnishing them necessaries in exchange\r\nfor their commodities, at such moderated prices as leave\r\nno gain, but cover us from loss, has the most conciliatory and\r\nuseful effect upon them, and is that which will best secure their\r\npeace and good will.\r\n\r\nThe small vessels authorized by Congress with a view to the\r\nMediterranean service, have been sent into that sea, and will be\r\nable more effectually to confine the Tripoline cruisers within\r\ntheir harbors, and supersede the necessity of convoy to our commerce\r\nin that quarter. They will sensibly lessen the expenses\r\nof that service the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nA further knowledge of the ground in the north-eastern and\r\nnorth-western angles of the United States has evinced that the\r\nboundaries established by the treaty of Paris, between the British\r\nterritories and ours in those parts, were too imperfectly described\r\nto be susceptible of execution. It has therefore been\r\nthought worthy of attention, for preserving and cherishing the\r\nharmony and useful intercourse subsisting between the two nations,\r\nto remove by timely arrangements what unfavorable incidents\r\nmight otherwise render a ground of future misunderstanding.\r\nA convention has therefore been entered into, which provides\r\nfor a practicable demarkation of those limits to the satisfaction\r\nof both parties.\r\n\r\nAn account of the receipts and expenditures of the year ending\r\n30th September last, with the estimates for the service of the\r\nensuing year, will be laid before you by the secretary of the\r\ntreasury so soon as the receipts of the last quarter shall be returned\r\nfrom the more distant States. It is already ascertained\r\nthat the amount paid into the treasury for that year has been between\r\neleven and twelve millions of dollars, and that the revenue\r\naccrued during the same term exceeds the sum counted on as\r\nsufficient for our current expenses, and to extinguish the public\r\ndebt within the period heretofore proposed.\r\n\r\nThe amount of debt paid for the same year is about three\r\nmillions one hundred thousand dollars, exclusive of interest, and\r\nmaking, with the payment of the preceding year, a discharge of\r\nmore than eight millions and a half of dollars of the principal of\r\nthat debt, besides the accruing interest; and there remain in the\r\ntreasury nearly six millions of dollars. Of these, eight hundred\r\nand eighty thousand have been reserved for payment of the first\r\ninstalment due under the British convention of January 8th,\r\n1802, and two millions are what have been before mentioned as\r\nplaced by Congress under the power and accountability of the\r\npresident, toward the price of New Orleans and other territories\r\nacquired, which, remaining untouched, are still applicable to\r\nthat object, and go in diminution of the sum to be funded for it.\r\n\r\nShould the acquisition of Louisiana be constitutionally confirmed\r\nand carried into effect, a sum of nearly thirteen millions of\r\ndollars will then be added to our public debt, most of which is\r\npayable after fifteen years; before which term the present existing\r\ndebts will all be discharged by the established operation of\r\nthe sinking fund. When we contemplate the ordinary annual\r\naugmentation of imposts from increasing population and wealth,\r\nthe augmentation of the same revenue by its extension to the\r\nnew acquisition, and the economies which may still be introduced\r\ninto our public expenditures, I cannot but hope that Congress\r\nin reviewing their resources will find means to meet the\r\nintermediate interests of this additional debt without recurring\r\nto new taxes, and applying to this object only the ordinary\r\nprogression of our revenue. Its extraordinary increase in times\r\nof foreign war will be the proper and sufficient fund for any\r\nmeasures of safety or precaution which that state of things may\r\nrender necessary in our neutral position.\r\n\r\nRemittances for the instalments of our foreign debt having\r\nbeen found practicable without loss, it has not been thought expedient\r\nto use the power given by a former act of Congress of\r\ncontinuing them by reloans, and of redeeming instead thereof\r\nequal sums of domestic debt, although no difficulty was found\r\nin obtaining that accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe sum of fifty thousand dollars appropriated by Congress\r\nfor providing gun-boats, remains unexpended. The favorable\r\nand peaceful turn of affairs on the Mississippi rendered an immediate\r\nexecution of that law unnecessary, and time was desirable\r\nin order that the institution of that branch of our force might\r\nbegin on models the most approved by experience. The same\r\nissue of events dispensed with a resort to the appropriation of a\r\nmillion and a half of dollars contemplated for purposes which\r\nwere effected by happier means.\r\n\r\nWe have seen with sincere concern the flames of war lighted\r\nup again in Europe, and nations with which we have the most\r\nfriendly and useful relations engaged in mutual destruction.\r\nWhile we regret the miseries in which we see others involved,\r\nlet us bow with gratitude to that kind Providence which, inspiring\r\nwith wisdom and moderation our late legislative councils\r\nwhile placed under the urgency of the greatest wrongs,\r\nguarded us from hastily entering into the sanguinary contest, and\r\nleft us only to look on and to pity its ravages. These will be\r\nheaviest on those immediately engaged. Yet the nations pursuing\r\npeace will not be exempt from all evil. In the course of\r\nthis conflict, let it be our endeavor, as it is our interest and desire,\r\nto cultivate the friendship of the belligerent nations by\r\nevery act of justice and of incessant kindness; to receive their\r\narmed vessels with hospitality from the distresses of the sea, but\r\nto administer the means of annoyance to none; to establish in\r\nour harbors such a police as may maintain law and order; to restrain\r\nour citizens from embarking individually in a war in\r\nwhich their country takes no part; to punish severely those persons,\r\ncitizen or alien, who shall usurp the cover of our flag for\r\nvessels not entitled to it, infecting thereby with suspicion those\r\nof real Americans, and committing us into controversies for the\r\nredress of wrongs not our own; to exact from every nation the\r\nobservance, toward our vessels and citizens, of those principles\r\nand practices which all civilized people acknowledge; to merit\r\nthe character of a just nation, and maintain that of an independent\r\none, preferring every consequence to insult and habitual\r\nwrong. Congress will consider whether the existing laws enable\r\nus efficaciously to maintain this course with our citizens in\r\nall places, and with others while within the limits of our jurisdiction,\r\nand will give them the new modifications necessary for\r\nthese objects. Some contraventions of right have already taken\r\nplace, both within our jurisdictional limits and on the high seas.\r\nThe friendly disposition of the governments from whose agents\r\nthey have proceeded, as well as their wisdom and regard for justice,\r\nleave us in reasonable expectation that they will be rectified\r\nand prevented in future; and that no act will be countenanced\r\nby them which threatens to disturb our friendly intercourse.\r\nSeparated by a wide ocean from the nations of Europe, and\r\nfrom the political interests which entangle them together, with\r\nproductions and wants which render our commerce and friendship\r\nuseful to them and theirs to us, it cannot be the interest of\r\nany to assail us, nor ours to disturb them. We should be most\r\nunwise, indeed, were we to cast away the singular blessings of\r\nthe position in which nature has placed us, the opportunity she\r\nhas endowed us with of pursuing, at a distance from foreign\r\ncontentions, the paths of industry, peace, and happiness; of\r\ncultivating general friendship, and of bringing collisions of interest\r\nto the umpirage of reason rather than of force. How desirable\r\nthen must it be, in a government like ours, to see its citizens\r\nadopt individually the views, the interests, and the conduct\r\nwhich their country should pursue, divesting themselves of those\r\npassions and partialities which tend to lessen useful friendships,\r\nand to embarrass and embroil us in the calamitous scenes of\r\nEurope. Confident, fellow citizens, that you will duly estimate\r\nthe importance of neutral dispositions toward the observance of\r\nneutral conduct, that you will be sensible how much it is our\r\nduty to look on the bloody arena spread before us with commiseration\r\nindeed, but with no other wish than to see it closed, I am\r\npersuaded you will cordially cherish these dispositions in all discussions\r\namong yourselves, and in all communications with your\r\nconstituents; and I anticipate with satisfaction the measures of\r\nwisdom which the great interests now committed to _you_ will\r\ngive you an opportunity of providing, and _myself_ that of approving\r\nand carrying into execution with the fidelity I owe to\r\nmy country.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--OCTOBER 21, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nIn my communication to you of the 17th instant, I informed\r\nyou that conventions had been entered into with the government\r\nof France for the cession of Louisiana to the United\r\nStates. These, with the advice and consent of the Senate,\r\nhaving now been ratified, and my ratification exchanged for\r\nthat of the first consul of France in due form, they are communicated\r\nto you for consideration in your legislative capacity.\r\nYou will observe that some important conditions cannot be carried\r\ninto execution, but with the aid of the legislature; and that\r\ntime presses a decision on them without delay.\r\n\r\nThe ulterior provisions, also suggested in the same communication,\r\nfor the occupation and government of the country, will\r\ncall for early attention. Such information relative to its government,\r\nas time and distance have enabled me to obtain, will be\r\nready to be laid before you within a few days. But, as permanent\r\narrangements for this object may require time and deliberation,\r\nit is for your consideration whether you will not, forthwith,\r\nmake such temporary provisions for the preservation, in the\r\nmeanwhile, of order and tranquillity in the country, as the case\r\nmay require.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--NOVEMBER 4, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nBy the copy now communicated of a letter from Captain Bainbridge\r\nof the Philadelphia frigate, to our consul at Gibraltar,\r\nyou will learn that an act of hostility has been committed on a\r\nmerchant vessel of the United States by an armed ship of the\r\nEmperor of Morocco. This conduct on the part of that power\r\nis without cause and without explanation. It is fortunate that\r\nCaptain Bainbridge fell in with and took the capturing vessel\r\nand her prize; and I have the satisfaction to inform you, that\r\nabout the date of this transaction such a force would be arriving\r\nin the neighborhood of Gibraltar, both from the east and the\r\nwest, as leaves less to be feared for our commerce from the suddenness\r\nof the aggression.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of September, the Constitution frigate, Captain\r\nPreble, with Mr. Lear on board, was within two days' sail of\r\nGibraltar, where the Philadelphia would then be arrived with\r\nher prize, and such explanations would probably be instituted as\r\nthe state of thing required, and as might perhaps arrest the progress\r\nof hostilities.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile it is for Congress to consider the provisional\r\nauthorities which may be necessary to restrain the depredations\r\nof this power, should they be continued.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--NOVEMBER 25, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nThe treaty with the Kaskaskia Indians being ratified with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, it is now laid before both\r\nhouses, in their legislative capacity. It will inform them of the\r\nobligations which the United States thereby contract, and particularly\r\nthat of taking the tribe under their future protection;\r\nand that the ceded country is submitted to their immediate possession\r\nand disposal.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--DECEMBER 5, 1803.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the act of hostility\r\nmentioned in my message of the 4th of November to have\r\nbeen committed by a cruiser of the emperor of Morocco on a\r\nvessel of the United States, has been disavowed by the emperor.\r\nAll difficulties in consequence thereof have been amicably adjusted,\r\nand the treaty of 1786, between this country and that,\r\nhas been recognized and confirmed by the emperor, each party\r\nrestoring to the other what had been detained or taken. I enclose\r\nthe emperor's orders given on this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe conduct of our officers generally, who have had a part in\r\nthese transactions, has merited entire approbation.\r\n\r\nThe temperate and correct course pursued by our consul, Mr.\r\nSimpson, the promptitude and energy of Commodore Preble, the\r\nefficacious co-operation of Captains Rodgers and Campbell of\r\nthe returning squadron, the proper decision of Captain Bainbridge\r\nthat a vessel which had committed an open hostility was\r\nof right to be detained for inquiry and consideration, and the\r\ngeneral zeal of the other officers and men, are honorable facts\r\nwhich I make known with pleasure. And to these I add what\r\nwas indeed transacted in another quarter--the gallant enterprise\r\nof Captain Rodgers in destroying, on the coast of Tripoli, a corvette\r\nof that power, of twenty-two guns.\r\n\r\nI recommended to the consideration of Congress a just indemnification\r\nfor the interest acquired by the captors of the\r\nMishouda and Mirboha, yielded by them for the public accommodation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--JANUARY 16, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nIn execution of the act of the present session of Congress\r\nfor taking possession of Louisiana, as ceded to us by France, and\r\nfor the temporary government thereof, Governor Claiborne, of\r\nthe Mississippi territory, and General Wilkinson, were appointed\r\ncommissioners to receive possession. They proceeded with such\r\nregular troops as had been assembled at Fort Adams, from the\r\nnearest posts, and with some militia of the Mississippi territory,\r\nto New Orleans. To be prepared for anything unexpected,\r\nwhich might arise out of the transaction, a respectable body of\r\nmilitia was ordered to be in readiness, in the States of Ohio,\r\nKentucky, and Tennessee, and a part of those of Tennessee\r\nwas moved on to Natchez. No occasion, however, arose for\r\ntheir services. Our commissioners, on their arrival at New Orleans,\r\nfound the province already delivered by the commissaries\r\nof Spain to that of France, who delivered it over to them on\r\nthe twentieth day of December, as appears by their declaratory\r\nact accompanying it. Governor Claiborne being duly invested\r\nwith the powers heretofore exercised by the governor and intendant\r\nof Louisiana, assumed the government on the same day,\r\nand for the maintenance of law and order, immediately issued\r\nthe proclamation and address now communicated.\r\n\r\nOn this important acquisition, so favorable to the immediate\r\ninterests of our western citizens, so auspicious to the peace and\r\nsecurity of the nation in general, which adds to our country territories\r\nso extensive and fertile, and to our citizens new brethren\r\nto partake of the blessings of freedom and self-government, I offer\r\nto Congress and the country, my sincere congratulations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--MARCH 20, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress, a letter received from Captain\r\nBainbridge, commander of the Philadelphia frigate, informing us\r\nof the wreck of that vessel on the coast of Tripoli, and that himself,\r\nhis officers, and men, had fallen into the hands of the Tripolitans.\r\nThis accident renders it expedient to increase our\r\nforce, and enlarge our expenses in the Mediterranean beyond\r\nwhat the last appropriation for the naval service contemplated.\r\nI recommend, therefore, to the consideration of Congress, such\r\nan addition to that appropriation as they may think the exigency\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.--NOVEMBER 8, 1804.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nTo a people, fellow citizens, who sincerely desire the happiness\r\nand prosperity of other nations; to those who justly calculate\r\nthat their own well-being is advanced by that of the nations\r\nwith which they have intercourse, it will be a satisfaction to observe\r\nthat the war which was lighted up in Europe a little before\r\nour last meeting has not yet extended its flames to other nations,\r\nnor been marked by the calamities which sometimes stain\r\nthe footsteps of war. The irregularities too on the ocean, which\r\ngenerally harass the commerce of neutral nations, have, in distant\r\nparts, disturbed ours less than on former occasions. But in the\r\nAmerican seas they have been greater from peculiar causes; and\r\neven within our harbors and jurisdiction, infringements on the\r\nauthority of the laws have been committed which have called\r\nfor serious attention. The friendly conduct of the governments\r\nfrom whose officers and subjects these acts have proceeded, in\r\nother respects and in places more under their observation and\r\ncontrol, gives us confidence that our representations on this subject\r\nwill have been properly regarded.\r\n\r\nWhile noticing the irregularities committed on the ocean by\r\nothers, those on our own part should not be omitted nor left unprovided\r\nfor. Complaints have been received that persons residing\r\nwithin the United States have taken on themselves to arm\r\nmerchant vessels, and to force a commerce into certain ports and\r\ncountries in defiance of the laws of those countries. That individuals\r\nshould undertake to wage private war, independently\r\nof the authority of their country, cannot be permitted in a well-ordered\r\nsociety. Its tendency to produce aggression on the laws\r\nand rights of other nations, and to endanger the peace of our\r\nown is so obvious, that I doubt not you will adopt measures for\r\nrestraining it effectually in future.\r\n\r\nSoon after the passage of the act of the last session, authorizing\r\nthe establishment of a district and port of entry on the waters\r\nof the Mobile, we learnt that its object was misunderstood on\r\nthe part of Spain. Candid explanations were immediately given,\r\nand assurances that, reserving our claims in that quarter as a subject\r\nof discussion and arrangement with Spain, no act was meditated,\r\nin the meantime, inconsistent with the peace and friendship\r\nexisting between the two nations, and that conformably to these\r\nintentions would be the execution of the law. That government\r\nhad, however, thought proper to suspend the ratification of the\r\nconvention of 1802. But the explanations which would reach\r\nthem soon after, and still more, the confirmation of them by the\r\ntenor of the instrument establishing the port and district, may\r\nreasonably be expected to replace them in the dispositions and\r\nviews of the whole subject which originally dictated the conviction.\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the objections which\r\nhad been urged by that government against the validity of our\r\ntitle to the country of Louisiana have been withdrawn, its exact\r\nlimits, however, remaining still to be settled between us. And\r\nto this is to be added that, having prepared and delivered the\r\nstock created in execution of the convention of Paris, of April\r\n30, 1803, in consideration of the cession of that country, we\r\nhave received from the government of France an acknowledgment,\r\nin due form, of the fulfilment of that stipulation.\r\n\r\nWith the nations of Europe in general our friendship and intercourse\r\nare undisturbed, and from the governments of the belligerent\r\npowers especially we continue to receive those friendly\r\nmanifestations which are justly due to an honest neutrality, and\r\nto such good offices consistent with that as we have opportunities\r\nof rendering.\r\n\r\nThe activity and success of the small force employed in the\r\nMediterranean in the early part of the present year, the reinforcement\r\nsent into that sea, and the energy of the officers having\r\ncommand in the several vessels, will, I trust, by the sufferings\r\nof war, reduce the barbarians of Tripoli to the desire of\r\npeace on proper terms. Great injury, however, ensues to ourselves\r\nas well as to others interested, from the distance to which\r\nprizes must be brought for adjudication, and from the impracticability\r\nof bringing hither such as are not seaworthy.\r\n\r\nThe bey of Tunis having made requisitions unauthorized by\r\nour treaty, their rejection has produced from him some expressions\r\nof discontent. But to those who expect us to calculate\r\nwhether a compliance with unjust demands will not cost us less\r\nthan a war, we must leave as a question of calculation for them,\r\nalso, whether to retire from unjust demands will not cost them\r\nless than a war. We can do to each other very sensible injuries\r\nby war, but the mutual advantages of peace make that the best\r\ninterest of both.\r\n\r\nPeace and intercourse with the other powers on the same\r\ncoast continue on the footing on which they are established by\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the act providing for the temporary government\r\nof Louisiana, the necessary officers for the territory of\r\nOrleans were appointed in due time, to commence the exercise\r\nof their functions on the first day of October. The distance,\r\nhowever, of some of them, and indispensable previous arrangements,\r\nmay have retarded its commencement in some of its\r\nparts; the form of government thus provided having been considered\r\nbut as temporary, and open to such improvements as\r\nfurther information of the circumstances of our brethren there\r\nmight suggest, it will of course be subject to your consideration.\r\n\r\nIn the district of Louisiana, it has been thought best to adopt\r\nthe division into subordinate districts, which had been established\r\nunder its former government. These being five in number,\r\na commanding officer has been appointed to each, according to\r\nthe provision of the law, and so soon as they can be at their station,\r\nthat district will also be in its due state of organization;\r\nin the meantime their places are supplied by the officers before\r\ncommanding there. The functions of the governor and judges\r\nof Indiana have commenced; the government, we presume, is\r\nproceeding in its new form. The lead mines in that district offer\r\nso rich a supply of that metal, as to merit attention. The report\r\nnow communicated will inform you of their state, and of\r\nthe necessity of immediate inquiry into their occupation and\r\ntitles.\r\n\r\nWith the Indian tribes established within our newly-acquired\r\nlimits, I have deemed it necessary to open conferences for the\r\npurpose of establishing a good understanding and neighborly relations\r\nbetween us. So far as we have yet learned, we have\r\nreason to believe that their dispositions are generally favorable\r\nand friendly; and with these dispositions on their part, we have\r\nin our own hands means which cannot fail us for preserving\r\ntheir peace and friendship. By pursuing a uniform course of\r\njustice toward them, by aiding them in all the improvements\r\nwhich may better their condition, and especially by establishing\r\na commerce on terms which shall be advantageous to them and\r\nonly not losing to us, and so regulated as that no incendiaries of\r\nour own or any other nation may be permitted to disturb the natural\r\neffects of our just and friendly offices, we may render ourselves\r\nso necessary to their comfort and prosperity, that the protection\r\nof our citizens from their disorderly members will become\r\ntheir interest and their voluntary care. Instead, therefore, of an\r\naugmentation of military force proportioned to our extension of\r\nfrontier, I proposed a moderate enlargement of the capital employed\r\nin that commerce, as a more effectual, economical, and\r\nhumane instrument for preserving peace and good neighborhood\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nOn this side the Mississippi an important relinquishment of\r\nnative title has been received from the Delawares. That tribe,\r\ndesiring to extinguish in their people the spirit of hunting, and\r\nto convert superfluous lands into the means of improving what\r\nthey retain, have ceded to us all the country between the Wabash\r\nand the Ohio, south of, and including the road from the\r\nrapids towards Vincennes, for which they are to receive annuities\r\nin animals and implements for agriculture, and in other\r\nnecessaries. This acquisition is important, not only for its extent\r\nand fertility, but as fronting three hundred miles on the\r\nOhio, and near half that on the Wabash. The produce of the settled\r\ncountries descending those rivers, will no longer pass in review\r\nof the Indian frontier but in a small portion, and with the\r\ncession heretofore made with the Kaskaskias, nearly consolidates\r\nour possessions north of the Ohio, in a very respectable breadth,\r\nfrom Lake Erie to the Mississippi. The Piankeshaws having\r\nsome claim to the country ceded by the Delawares, it has been\r\nthought best to quiet that by fair purchase also. So soon as the\r\ntreaties on this subject shall have received their constitutional\r\nsanctions, they shall be laid before both houses.\r\n\r\nThe act of Congress of February 28th, 1803, for building and\r\nemploying a number of gun-boats, is now in a course of execution\r\nto the extent there provided for. The obstacle to naval enterprise\r\nwhich vessels of this construction offer for our seaport\r\ntowns; their utility toward supporting within our waters the\r\nauthority of the laws; the promptness with which they will be\r\nmanned by the seamen and militia of the place the moment\r\nthey are wanting; the facility of their assembling from different\r\nparts of the coast to any point where they are required in greater\r\nforce than ordinary; the economy of their maintenance and preservation\r\nfrom decay when not in actual service; and the competence\r\nof our finances to this defensive provision, without any\r\nnew burden, are considerations which will have due weight\r\nwith Congress in deciding on the expediency of adding to their\r\nnumber from year to year, as experience shall test their utility,\r\nuntil all our important harbors, by these and auxiliary means,\r\nshall be insured against insult and opposition to the laws.\r\n\r\nNo circumstance has arisen since your last session which calls\r\nfor any augmentation of our regular military force. Should any\r\nimprovement occur in the militia system, that will be always\r\nseasonable.\r\n\r\nAccounts of the receipts and expenditures of the last year,\r\nwith estimates for the ensuing one, will as usual be laid before\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nThe state of our finances continue to fulfil our expectations.\r\nEleven millions and a half of dollars, received in the course of\r\nthe year ending on the 30th of September last, have enabled us,\r\nafter meeting all the ordinary expenses of the year, to pay upward\r\nof $3,600,000 of the public debt, exclusive of interest.\r\nThis payment, with those of the two preceding years, has extinguished\r\nupward of twelve millions of the principal, and a greater\r\nsum of interest, within that period; and by a proportional diminution\r\nof interest, renders already sensible the effect of the\r\ngrowing sum yearly applicable to the discharge of the principal.\r\n\r\nIt is also ascertained that the revenue accrued during the last\r\nyear, exceeds that of the preceding; and the probable receipts\r\nof the ensuing year may safely be relied on as sufficient, with\r\nthe sum already in the treasury, to meet all the current demands\r\nof the year, to discharge upward of three millions and a half of\r\nthe engagements incurred under the British and French conventions,\r\nand to advance in the farther redemption of the funded\r\ndebts as rapidly as had been contemplated. These, fellow\r\ncitizens, are the principal matters which I have thought it necessary\r\nat this time to communicate for your consideration and\r\nattention. Some others will be laid before you in the course of\r\nthe session, but in the discharge of the great duties confided to\r\nyou by our country, you will take a broader view of the field of\r\nlegislation. Whether the great interests of agriculture, manufactures,\r\ncommerce, or navigation, can, within the pale of your\r\nconstitutional powers, be aided in any of their relations; whether\r\nlaws are provided in all cases where they are wanting; whether\r\nthose provided are exactly what they should be; whether any\r\nabuses take place in their administration, or in that of the public\r\nrevenues; whether the organization of the public agents or of\r\nthe public force is perfect in all its parts; in fine, whether anything\r\ncan be done to advance the general good, are questions\r\nwithin the limits of your functions which will necessarily occupy\r\nyour attention. In these and other matters which you in your\r\nwisdom may propose for the good of our country, you may\r\ncount with assurance on my hearty co-operation and faithful\r\nexecution.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND INAUGURAL ADDRESS.--MARCH 4, 1805.\r\n\r\nProceeding, fellow citizens, to that qualification which the\r\nconstitution requires, before my entrance on the charge again\r\nconferred upon me, it is my duty to express the deep sense I entertain\r\nof this new proof of confidence from my fellow citizens\r\nat large, and the zeal with which it inspires me, so to conduct\r\nmyself as may best satisfy their just expectations.\r\n\r\nOn taking this station on a former occasion, I declared the\r\nprinciples on which I believed it my duty to administer the affairs\r\nof our commonwealth. My conscience tells me that I have,\r\non every occasion, acted up to that declaration, according to its\r\nobvious import, and to the understanding of every candid mind.\r\n\r\nIn the transaction of your foreign affairs, we have endeavored\r\nto cultivate the friendship of all nations, and especially of those\r\nwith which we have the most important relations. We have\r\ndone them justice on all occasions, favored where favor was lawful,\r\nand cherished mutual interests and intercourse on fair and\r\nequal terms. We are firmly convinced, and we act on that conviction,\r\nthat with nations, as with individuals, our interests\r\nsoundly calculated, will ever be found inseparable from our moral\r\nduties; and history bears witness to the fact, that a just nation is\r\ntaken on its word, when recourse is had to armaments and wars\r\nto bridle others.\r\n\r\nAt home, fellow citizens, you best know whether we have\r\ndone well or ill. The suppression of unnecessary offices, of useless\r\nestablishments and expenses, enabled us to discontinue our\r\ninternal taxes. These covering our land with officers, and opening\r\nour doors to their intrusions, had already begun that process\r\nof domiciliary vexation which, once entered, is scarcely to be\r\nrestrained from reaching successively every article of produce\r\nand property. If among these taxes some minor ones fell which\r\nhad not been inconvenient, it was because their amount would\r\nnot have paid the officers who collected them, and because, if\r\nthey had any merit, the state authorities might adopt them, instead\r\nof others less approved.\r\n\r\nThe remaining revenue on the consumption of foreign articles,\r\nis paid cheerfully by those who can afford to add foreign luxuries\r\nto domestic comforts, being collected on our seaboards and\r\nfrontiers only, and incorporated with the transactions of our mercantile\r\ncitizens, it may be the pleasure and pride of an American\r\nto ask, what farmer, what mechanic, what laborer, ever sees a\r\ntax-gatherer of the United States? These contributions enable\r\nus to support the current expenses of the government, to fulfil\r\ncontracts with foreign nations, to extinguish the native right of\r\nsoil within our limits, to extend those limits, and to apply such\r\na surplus to our public debts, as places at a short day their final\r\nredemption, and that redemption once effected, the revenue\r\nthereby liberated may, by a just repartition among the states, and\r\na corresponding amendment of the constitution, be applied, _in\r\ntime of peace_, to rivers, canals, roads, arts, manufactures, education,\r\nand other great objects within each state. _In time of war_,\r\nif injustice, by ourselves or others, must sometimes produce war,\r\nincreased as the same revenue will be increased by population\r\nand consumption, and aided by other resources reserved for that\r\ncrisis, it may meet within the year all the expenses of the year,\r\nwithout encroaching on the rights of future generations, by burdening\r\nthem with the debts of the past. War will then be but\r\na suspension of useful works, and a return to a state of peace, a\r\nreturn to the progress of improvement.\r\n\r\nI have said, fellow citizens, that the income reserved had enabled\r\nus to extend our limits; but that extension may possibly\r\npay for itself before we are called on, and in the meantime, may\r\nkeep down the accruing interest; in all events, it will repay the\r\nadvances we have made. I know that the acquisition of Louisiana\r\nhas been disapproved by some, from a candid apprehension\r\nthat the enlargement of our territory would endanger its union.\r\nBut who can limit the extent to which the federative principle\r\nmay operate effectively? The larger our association, the less\r\nwill it be shaken by local passions; and in any view, is it not better\r\nthat the opposite bank of the Mississippi should be settled by\r\nour own brethren and children, than by strangers of another family?\r\nWith which shall we be most likely to live in harmony\r\nand friendly intercourse?\r\n\r\nIn matters of religion, I have considered that its free exercise\r\nis placed by the constitution independent of the powers of the\r\ngeneral government. I have therefore undertaken, on no occasion,\r\nto prescribe the religious exercises suited to it; but have\r\nleft them, as the constitution found them, under the direction\r\nand discipline of state or church authorities acknowledged by\r\nthe several religious societies.\r\n\r\nThe aboriginal inhabitants of these countries I have regarded\r\nwith the commiseration their history inspires. Endowed with\r\nthe faculties and the rights of men, breathing an ardent love of\r\nliberty and independence, and occupying a country which left\r\nthem no desire but to be undisturbed, the stream of overflowing\r\npopulation from other regions directed itself on these shores;\r\nwithout power to divert, or habits to contend against, they have\r\nbeen overwhelmed by the current, or driven before it; now reduced\r\nwithin limits too narrow for the hunter's state, humanity\r\nenjoins us to teach them agriculture and the domestic arts; to\r\nencourage them to that industry which alone can enable them\r\nto maintain their place in existence, and to prepare them in time\r\nfor that state of society, which to bodily comforts adds the improvement\r\nof the mind and morals. We have therefore liberally\r\nfurnished them with the implements of husbandry and household\r\nuse; we have placed among them instructors in the arts of\r\nfirst necessity; and they are covered with the ægis of the law\r\nagainst aggressors from among ourselves.\r\n\r\nBut the endeavors to enlighten them on the fate which awaits\r\ntheir present course of life, to induce them to exercise their\r\nreason, follow its dictates, and change their pursuits with the\r\nchange of circumstances, have powerful obstacles to encounter;\r\nthey are combated by the habits of their bodies, prejudice of\r\ntheir minds, ignorance, pride, and the influence of interested and\r\ncrafty individuals among them, who feel themselves something\r\nin the present order of things, and fear to become nothing in any\r\nother. These persons inculcate a sanctimonious reverence for\r\nthe customs of their ancestors; that whatsoever they did, must\r\nbe done through all time; that reason is a false guide, and to advance\r\nunder its counsel, in their physical, moral, or political\r\ncondition, is perilous innovation; that their duty is to remain as\r\ntheir Creator made them, ignorance being safety, and knowledge\r\nfull of danger; in short, my friends, among them is seen the\r\naction and counteraction of good sense and bigotry; they, too,\r\nhave their anti-philosophers, who find an interest in keeping\r\nthings in their present state, who dread reformation, and exert\r\nall their faculties to maintain the ascendency of habit over the\r\nduty of improving our reason, and obeying its mandates.\r\n\r\nIn giving these outlines, I do not mean, fellow citizens, to arrogate\r\nto myself the merit of the measures; that is due, in the\r\nfirst place, to the reflecting character of our citizens at large,\r\nwho, by the weight of public opinion, influence and strengthen\r\nthe public measures; it is due to the sound discretion with which\r\nthey select from among themselves those to whom they confide\r\nthe legislative duties; it is due to the zeal and wisdom of the\r\ncharacters thus selected, who lay the foundations of public happiness\r\nin wholesome laws, the execution of which alone remains\r\nfor others; and it is due to the able and faithful auxiliaries, whose\r\npatriotism has associated with me in the executive functions.\r\n\r\nDuring this course of administration, and in order to disturb\r\nit, the artillery of the press has been levelled against us, charged\r\nwith whatsoever its licentiousness could devise or dare. These\r\nabuses of an institution so important to freedom and science, are\r\ndeeply to be regretted, inasmuch as they tend to lessen its usefulness,\r\nand to sap its safety; they might, indeed, have been\r\ncorrected by the wholesome punishments reserved and provided\r\nby the laws of the several States against falsehood and defamation;\r\nbut public duties more urgent press on the time of public\r\nservants, and the offenders have therefore been left to find their\r\npunishment in the public indignation.\r\n\r\nNor was it uninteresting to the world, that an experiment\r\nshould be fairly and fully made, whether freedom of discussion,\r\nunaided by power, is not sufficient for the propagation and protection\r\nof truth--whether a government, conducting itself in the\r\ntrue spirit of its constitution, with zeal and purity, and doing no\r\nact which it would be unwilling the whole world should witness,\r\ncan be written down by falsehood and defamation. The\r\nexperiment has been tried; you have witnessed the scene; our\r\nfellow citizens have looked on, cool and collected; they saw the\r\nlatent source from which these outrages proceeded; they gathered\r\naround their public functionaries, and when the constitution called\r\nthem to the decision by suffrage, they pronounced their verdict,\r\nhonorable to those who had served them, and consolatory to the\r\nfriend of man, who believes he may be intrusted with his own\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nNo inference is here intended, that the laws, provided by the\r\nState against false and defamatory publications, should not be\r\nenforced; he who has time, renders a service to public morals\r\nand public tranquillity, in reforming these abuses by the salutary\r\ncoercions of the law; but the experiment is noted, to prove that,\r\nsince truth and reason have maintained their ground against false\r\nopinions in league with false facts, the press, confined to truth,\r\nneeds no other legal restraint; the public judgment will correct\r\nfalse reasonings and opinions, on a full hearing of all parties;\r\nand no other definite line can be drawn between the inestimable\r\nliberty of the press and its demoralizing licentiousness. If there\r\nbe still improprieties which this rule would not restrain, its supplement\r\nmust be sought in the censorship of public opinion.\r\n\r\nContemplating the union of sentiment now manifested so generally,\r\nas auguring harmony and happiness to our future course,\r\nI offer to our country sincere congratulations. With those, too,\r\nnot yet rallied to the same point, the disposition to do so is gaining\r\nstrength; facts are piercing through the veil drawn over them;\r\nand our doubting brethren will at length see, that the mass of\r\ntheir fellow citizens, with whom they cannot yet resolve to act,\r\nas to principles and measures, think as they think, and desire\r\nwhat they desire; that our wish, as well as theirs, is, that the\r\npublic efforts may be directed honestly to the public good, that\r\npeace be cultivated, civil and religious liberty unassailed, law and\r\norder preserved, equality of rights maintained, and that state of\r\nproperty, equal or unequal, which results to every man from his\r\nown industry, or that of his fathers. When satisfied of these\r\nviews, it is not in human nature that they should not approve\r\nand support them; in the meantime, let us cherish them with\r\npatient affection; let us do them justice, and more than justice,\r\nin all competitions of interest; and we need not doubt that truth,\r\nreason, and their own interests, will at length prevail, will gather\r\nthem into the fold of their country, and will complete their entire\r\nunion of opinion, which gives to a nation the blessing of harmony,\r\nand the benefit of all its strength.\r\n\r\nI shall now enter on the duties to which my fellow citizens\r\nhave again called me, and shall proceed in the spirit of those\r\nprinciples which they have approved. I fear not that any motives\r\nof interest may lead me astray; I am sensible of no passion\r\nwhich could seduce me knowingly from the path of justice; but\r\nthe weakness of human nature, and the limits of my own understanding,\r\nwill produce errors of judgment sometimes injurious to\r\nyour interests. I shall need, therefore, all the indulgence I have\r\nheretofore experienced--the want of it will certainly not lessen\r\nwith increasing years. I shall need, too, the favor of that Being\r\nin whose hands we are, who led our forefathers, as Israel of old,\r\nfrom their native land, and planted them in a country flowing\r\nwith all the necessaries and comforts of life; who has covered\r\nour infancy with his providence, and our riper years with his\r\nwisdom and power; and to whose goodness I ask you to join\r\nwith me in supplications, that he will so enlighten the minds of\r\nyour servants, guide their councils, and prosper their measures,\r\nthat whatsoever they do, shall result in your good, and shall secure\r\nto you the peace, friendship, and approbation of all nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIFTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.--DECEMBER 3, 1805.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nAt a moment when the nations of Europe are in commotion\r\nand arming against each other, and when those with whom we\r\nhave principal intercourse are engaged in the general contest,\r\nand when the countenance of some of them toward our peaceable\r\ncountry threatens that even that may not be unaffected by\r\nwhat is passing on the general theatre, a meeting of the representatives\r\nof the nation in both houses of Congress has become\r\nmore than usually desirable. Coming from every section of our\r\ncountry, they bring with them the sentiments and the information\r\nof the whole, and will be enabled to give a direction to the\r\npublic affairs which the will and wisdom of the whole will approve\r\nand support.\r\n\r\nIn taking a view of the state of our country, we in the first\r\nplace notice the late affliction of two of our cities under the\r\nfatal fever which in latter times has occasionally visited our\r\nshores. Providence in his goodness gave it an early termination\r\non this occasion, and lessened the number of victims which have\r\nusually fallen before it. In the course of the several visitations\r\nby this disease it has appeared that it is strictly local; incident\r\nto the cities and on the tide waters only; incommunicable in the\r\ncountry, either by persons under the disease or by goods carried\r\nfrom diseased places; that its access is with the autumn, and that\r\nit disappears with the early frosts. These restrictions within\r\nnarrow limits of time and space give security even to our maritime\r\ncities during three-fourths of the year, and to the country\r\nalways. Although from these facts it appears unnecessary, yet\r\nto satisfy the fears of foreign nations, and cautions on their part\r\nnot to be complained of in a danger whose limits are yet unknown\r\nto them, I have strictly enjoined on the officers at the\r\nhead of the customs to certify with exact truth for every vessel\r\nsailing for a foreign port, the state of health respecting this fever\r\nwhich prevails at the place from which she sails. Under every\r\nmotive from character and duty to certify the truth, I have no\r\ndoubt they have faithfully executed this injunction. Much real\r\ninjury has, however, been sustained from a propensity to identify\r\nwith this epidemic, and to call by the same name, fevers of very\r\ndifferent kinds, which have been known at all times and in all\r\ncountries, and never have been placed among those deemed contagious.\r\nAs we advance in our knowledge of this disease, as\r\nfacts develop the sources from which individuals receive it, the\r\nstate authorities charged with the care of the public health, and\r\nCongress with that of the general commerce, will become able\r\nto regulate with effect their respective functions in these departments.\r\nThe burden of quarantines is felt at home as well as\r\nabroad; their efficacy merits examination. Although the health\r\nlaws of the States should be found to need no present revisal by\r\nCongress, yet commerce claims that their attention be ever awake\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nSince our last meeting the aspect of our foreign relations has\r\nconsiderably changed. Our coasts have been infested and our\r\nharbors watched by private armed vessels, some of them without\r\ncommissions, some with illegal commissions, others with those of\r\nlegal form but committing piratical acts beyond the authority of\r\ntheir commissions. They have captured in the very entrance\r\nof our harbors, as well as on the high seas, not only the vessels\r\nof our friends coming to trade with us, but our own also. They\r\nhave carried them off under pretence of legal adjudication, but\r\nnot daring to approach a court of justice, they have plundered\r\nand sunk them by the way, or in obscure places where no evidence\r\ncould arise against them; maltreated the crews, and abandoned\r\nthem in boats in the open sea or on desert shores without\r\nfood or covering. These enormities appearing to be unreached\r\nby any control of their sovereigns, I found it necessary to equip a\r\nforce to cruise within our own seas, to arrest all vessels of these\r\ndescriptions found hovering on our coast within the limits of the\r\nGulf Stream, and to bring the offenders in for trial as pirates.\r\n\r\nThe same system of hovering on our coasts and harbors under\r\ncolor of seeking enemies, has been also carried on by public\r\narmed ships, to the great annoyance and oppression of our commerce.\r\nNew principles, too, have been interloped into the law\r\nof nations, founded neither in justice nor the usage or acknowledgment\r\nof nations. According to these, a belligerent takes to\r\nhimself a commerce with its own enemy which it denies to a\r\nneutral, on the ground of its aiding that enemy in the war. But\r\nreason revolts at such an inconsistency, and the neutral having\r\nequal right with the belligerent to decide the question, the interest\r\nof our constituents and the duty of maintaining the authority\r\nof reason, the only umpire between just nations, impose\r\non us the obligation of providing an effectual and determined\r\nopposition to a doctrine so injurious to the rights of peaceable\r\nnations. Indeed, the confidence we ought to have in the justice\r\nof others, still countenances the hope that a sounder view of those\r\nrights will of itself induce from every belligerent a more correct\r\nobservance of them.\r\n\r\nWith Spain our negotiations for a settlement of differences\r\nhave not had a satisfactory issue. Spoliations during the former\r\nwar, for which she had formally acknowledged herself responsible,\r\nhave been refused to be compensated, but on conditions affecting\r\nother claims in nowise connected with them. Yet the\r\nsame practices are renewed in the present war, and are already of\r\ngreat amount. On the Mobile, our commerce passing through that\r\nriver continues to be obstructed by arbitrary duties and vexatious\r\nsearches. Propositions for adjusting amicably the boundaries of\r\nLouisiana have not been acceded to. While, however, the right\r\nis unsettled, we have avoided changing the state of things by\r\ntaking new posts or strengthening ourselves in the disputed territories,\r\nin the hope that the other power would not, by contrary\r\nconduct, oblige us to meet their example, and endanger conflicts\r\nof authority the issue of which may not be easily controlled.\r\nBut in this hope we have now reason to lessen our confidence.\r\nInroads have been recently made into the territories of Orleans\r\nand the Mississippi, our citizens have been seized and their\r\nproperty plundered in the very parts of the former which had\r\nbeen actually delivered up by Spain, and this by the regular officers\r\nand soldiers of that government. I have therefore found it\r\nnecessary at length to give orders to our troops on that frontier\r\nto be in readiness to protect our citizens, and to repel by arms\r\nany similar aggression in future. Other details, necessary for\r\nyour full information of the state of things between this country\r\nand that shall be the subject of another communication.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing these injuries from some of the belligerent powers,\r\nthe moderation, the firmness, and the wisdom of the legislature\r\nwill be all called into action. We ought still to hope that\r\ntime and a more correct estimate of interest, as well as of character,\r\nwill produce the justice we are bound to expect. But\r\nshould any nation deceive itself by false calculations, and disappoint\r\nthat expectation, we must join in the unprofitable contest\r\nof trying which party can do the other the most harm. Some\r\nof these injuries may perhaps admit a peaceable remedy. Where\r\nthat is competent it is always the most desirable. But some of\r\nthem are of a nature to be met by force only, and all of them\r\nmay lead to it. I cannot, therefore, but recommend such preparations\r\nas circumstances call for. The first object is to place\r\nour seaport towns out of the danger of insult. Measures have\r\nbeen already taken for furnishing them with heavy cannon for\r\nthe service of such land batteries as may make a part of their defence\r\nagainst armed vessels approaching them. In aid of these\r\nit is desirable that we should have a competent number of gunboats;\r\nand the number, to be competent, must be considerable.\r\nIf immediately begun, they may be in readiness for service at\r\nthe opening of the next season. Whether it will be necessary\r\nto augment our land forces will be decided by occurrences probably\r\nin the course of your session. In the meantime, you will\r\nconsider whether it would not be expedient, for a state of peace\r\nas well as of war, so to organize or class the militia as would\r\nenable us, on a sudden emergency, to call for the services of the\r\nyounger portions, unencumbered with the old and those having\r\nfamilies. Upward of three hundred thousand able-bodied men,\r\nbetween the ages of eighteen and twenty-six years, which the\r\nlast census shows we may now count within our limits, will furnish\r\na competent number for offence or defence in any point\r\nwhere they may be wanted, and will give time for raising regular\r\nforces after the necessity of them shall become certain; and\r\nthe reducing to the early period of life all its active service cannot\r\nbut be desirable to our younger citizens, of the present as\r\nwell as future times, inasmuch as it engages to them in more advanced\r\nage a quiet and undisturbed repose in the bosom of their\r\nfamilies. I cannot, then, but earnestly recommend to your early\r\nconsideration the expediency of so modifying our militia system\r\nas, by a separation of the more active part from that which is\r\nless so, we may draw from it, when necessary, an efficient corps\r\nfit for real and active service, and to be called to it in regular\r\nrotation.\r\n\r\nConsiderable provision has been made, under former authorities\r\nfrom Congress, of materials for the construction of ships of war\r\nof seventy-four guns. These materials are on hand, subject to\r\nthe further will of the legislature.\r\n\r\nAn immediate prohibition of the exportation of arms and ammunition\r\nis also submitted to your determination.\r\n\r\nTurning from these unpleasant views of violence and wrong,\r\nI congratulate you on the liberation of our fellow citizens who\r\nwere stranded on the coast of Tripoli and made prisoners of war.\r\nIn a government bottomed on the will of all, the life and liberty\r\nof every individual citizen become interesting to all. In the\r\ntreaty, therefore, which has concluded our warfare with that\r\nState, an article for the ransom of our citizens has been agreed\r\nto. An operation by land, by a small band of our countrymen,\r\nand others--engaged for the occasion, in conjunction with the\r\ntroops of the ex-bashaw of that country, gallantly conducted by\r\nour late consul Eaton, and their successful enterprise on the city\r\nof Derne, contributed, doubtless, to the impression which produced\r\npeace; and the conclusion of this prevented opportunities\r\nof which the officers and men of our squadron destined for Tripoli\r\nwould have availed themselves, to emulate the acts of valor\r\nexhibited by their brethren in the attack of the last year. Reflecting\r\nwith high satisfaction on the distinguished bravery displayed\r\nwhenever occasion permitted in the Mediterranean service,\r\nI think it would be a useful encouragement, as well as a\r\njust reward, to make an opening for some present promotion by\r\nenlarging our peace establishment of captains and lieutenants.\r\n\r\nWith Tunis some misunderstandings have arisen, not yet sufficiently\r\nexplained, but friendly discussions with their ambassador\r\nrecently arrived, and a mutual disposition to do whatever\r\nis just and reasonable, cannot fail of dissipating these; so that\r\nwe may consider our peace on that coast, generally, to be on as\r\nsound a footing as it has been at any preceding time. Still it\r\nwill not be expedient to withdraw, immediately, the whole of\r\nour force from that sea.\r\n\r\nThe law for providing a naval peace establishment fixes the\r\nnumber of frigates which shall be kept in constant service in\r\ntime of peace, and prescribes that they shall not be manned by\r\nmore than two-thirds of their complement of seamen and ordinary\r\nseamen. Whether a frigate may be trusted to two-thirds only\r\nof her proper complement of men must depend on the nature of\r\nthe service on which she is ordered; that may sometimes, for\r\nher safety, as well as to insure her object, require her fullest complement.\r\nIn adverting to this subject, Congress will perhaps\r\nconsider whether the best limitation on the executive discretion\r\nin this case would not be by the number of seamen which may\r\nbe employed in the whole service, rather than by the number\r\nof vessels. Occasions oftener arise for the employment of small\r\nthan of large vessels, and it would lessen risk as well as expense\r\nto be authorized to employ them of preference. The limitation\r\nsuggested by the number of seamen would admit a selection of\r\nvessels best adapted to the service.\r\n\r\nOur Indian neighbors are advancing, many of them with spirit\r\nand others beginning to engage, in the pursuits of agriculture\r\nand household manufacture. They are becoming sensible that\r\nthe earth yields subsistence with less labor and more certainty\r\nthan the forest, and find it their interest, from time to time, to\r\ndispose of parts of their surplus and waste lands for the means\r\nof improving those they occupy, and of subsisting their families\r\nwhile they are preparing their farms. Since your last session,\r\nthe northern tribes have sold to us the lands between the Connecticut\r\nreserve and the former Indian boundary; and those on\r\nthe Ohio, from the same boundary to the rapids, and for a considerable\r\ndepth inland. The Chickasaws and Cherokees have\r\nsold us the country between and adjacent to the two districts of\r\nTennessee, and the Creeks, the residue of their lands in the fork\r\nof Ocmulgee, up to the Ulcofauhatche. The three former purchases\r\nare important, inasmuch as they consolidate disjointed\r\nparts of our settled country, and render their intercourse secure;\r\nand the second particularly so, as with the small point on the\r\nriver which we expect is by this time ceded by the Piankeshaws,\r\nit completes our possession of the whole of both banks of the\r\nOhio, from its source to near its mouth, and the navigation of\r\nthat river is thereby rendered forever safe to our citizens settled\r\nand settling on its extensive waters. The purchase from the\r\nCreeks too has been for some time particularly interesting to the\r\nState of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe several treaties which have been mentioned will be submitted\r\nto both houses of Congress for the exercise of their respective\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nDeputations now on their way to the seat of government, from\r\nvarious nations of Indians inhabiting the Missouri and other\r\nparts beyond the Mississippi, come charged with the assurances\r\nof their satisfaction with the new relations in which they are\r\nplaced with us, of their disposition to cultivate our peace and\r\nfriendship, and their desire to enter into commercial intercourse\r\nwith us. A statement of our progress in exploring the principal\r\nrivers of that country, and of the information respecting them\r\nhitherto obtained, will be communicated so soon as we shall\r\nreceive some further relations which we have reason shortly to\r\nexpect.\r\n\r\nThe receipts at the treasury during the year ending the\r\n30th day of September last, have exceeded the sum of thirteen\r\nmillions of dollars, which, with not quite five millions in\r\nthe treasury at the beginning of the year, have enabled us,\r\nafter meeting other demands, to pay nearly two millions of\r\nthe debt contracted under the British treaty and convention, upward\r\nof four millions of principal of the public debt, and four\r\nmillions of interest. These payments, with those which had\r\nbeen made in three years and a half preceding, have extinguished\r\nof the funded debt nearly eighteen millions of principal.\r\nCongress, by their act of November 10th, 1803, authorized us to\r\nborrow one million seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars, toward\r\nmeeting the claims of our citizens assumed by the convention\r\nwith France. We have not, however, made use of this authority,\r\nbecause the sum of four millions and a half, which\r\nremained in the treasury on the same 30th day of September\r\nlast, with the receipts which we may calculate on for the ensuing\r\nyear, besides paying the annual sum of eight millions of dollars\r\nappropriated to the funded debts, and meeting all the current demands\r\nwhich may be expected, will enable us to pay the whole\r\nsum of three millions seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\r\nassumed by the French convention, and still leaves a surplus of\r\nnearly a million of dollars at our free disposal. Should you concur\r\nin the provisions of arms and armed vessels recommended\r\nby the circumstances of the times, this surplus will furnish the\r\nmeans of doing so.\r\n\r\nOn this first occasion of addressing Congress, since, by the\r\nchoice of my constituents, I have entered on a second term of\r\nadministration, I embrace the opportunity to give this public assurance,\r\nthat I will exert my best endeavors to administer faithfully\r\nthe executive department, and will zealously co-operate\r\nwith you in every measure which may tend to secure the liberty,\r\nproperty, and personal safety of our fellow citizens, and to consolidate\r\nthe republican forms and principles of our government.\r\n\r\nIn the course of your session you shall receive all the aid\r\nwhich I can give for the despatch of the public business, and\r\nall the information necessary for your deliberations, of which the\r\ninterests of our own country and the confidence reposed in us\r\nby others will admit a communication.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--JANUARY 13, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nI lay before Congress the application of Hamet Caramalli,\r\nelder brother of the reigning bashaw of Tripoli, soliciting from\r\nthe United States attention to his services and sufferings in the\r\nlate war against that State. And in order to possess them of\r\nthe ground on which that application stands, the facts shall be\r\nstated according to the views and information of the executive.\r\n\r\nDuring the war with Tripoli, it was suggested that Hamet\r\nCaramalli, elder brother of the reigning bashaw, and driven by\r\nhim from his throne, meditated the recovery of his inheritance,\r\nand that a concert in action with us was desirable to him. We\r\nconsidered that concerted operations by those who have a common\r\nenemy were entirely justifiable, and might produce effects\r\nfavorable to both, without binding either to guaranty the objects\r\nof the other. But the distance of the scene, the difficulties of\r\ncommunication, and the uncertainty of our information, inducing\r\nthe less confidence in the measures, it was committed to our\r\nagents as one which might be resorted to if it promised to promote\r\nour success.\r\n\r\nMr. Eaton, however (our late consul,) on his return from the\r\nMediterranean, possessing a personal knowledge of the scene,\r\nand having confidence in the effect of a joint operation, we\r\nauthorized Commodore Barron, then proceeding with his squadron,\r\nto enter into an understanding with Hamet if he should\r\ndeem it useful; and as it was represented that he would need\r\nsome aids of arms, and ammunition, and even of money, he\r\nwas authorized to furnish them to a moderate extent, according\r\nto the prospect of utility to be expected from it. In order to\r\navail him of the advantages of Mr. Eaton's knowledge of circumstances,\r\nan occasional employment was provided for the latter\r\nas an agent for the navy in that sea. Our expectation was,\r\nthat an intercourse should be kept up between the ex-bashaw\r\nand the commodore, that while the former moved on by land,\r\nour squadron should proceed with equal pace so as to arrive at\r\ntheir destination together, and to attack the common enemy by\r\nland and sea at the same time. The instructions of June 6th,\r\nto Commodore Barron, show that a co-operation only was intended,\r\nand by no means a union of our object with the fortune of\r\nthe ex-bashaw, and the commodore's letters of March 22d and\r\nMay 19th proved that he had the most correct idea of our\r\nintentions. His verbal instructions indeed to Mr. Eaton and\r\nCaptain Hull, if the expressions are accurately committed to\r\nwriting by those gentlemen, do not limit the extent of his co-operation\r\nas rigorously as he probably intended; but it is certain,\r\nfrom the ex-bashaw's letter of January 3d, written when he was\r\nproceeding to join Mr. Eaton, and in which he says, \"Your\r\noperations should be carried on by sea, mine by land,\" that he\r\nleft the position in which he was with a proper idea of the nature\r\nof the co-operation. If Mr. Eaton's subsequent convention\r\nshould appear to bring forward other objects, his letter of April\r\n29th and May 1st views this convention but as provisional, the\r\nsecond article, as he expressly states, guarding it against any ill\r\neffect; and his letter of June 30th confirms this construction.\r\n\r\nIn the event it was found that after placing the ex-bashaw in\r\npossession of Derne, one of the most important cities and provinces\r\nof the country, where he had resided himself as governor,\r\nhe was totally unable to command any resources, or to bear any\r\npart in the co-operation with us. This hope was then at an end,\r\nand we certainly had never contemplated, nor were we prepared\r\nto land an army of our own, or to raise, pay, or subsist, an army\r\nof Arabs, to march from Derne to Tripoli and to carry on a land\r\nwar at such a distance from our resources. Our means and our\r\nauthority was merely naval, and that such were the expectations\r\nof Hamet, his letter of June 29th is an unexpected acknowledgment.\r\nWhile, therefore, an impression from the capture of\r\nDerne might still operate at Tripoli, and an attack on that place\r\nfrom our squadron was daily expected, Colonel Lear thought it\r\nthe best moment to listen to overtures of peace then made by\r\nthe bashaw. He did so, and while urging provisions for the\r\nUnited States, he paid attention also to the interests of Hamet;\r\nbut was able to effect nothing more than to engage the restitution\r\nof his family, and even the persevering in this demand suspended\r\nfor some time the conclusion of the treaty.\r\n\r\nIn operations at such a distance, it becomes necessary to leave\r\nmuch to the discretion of the agents employed, but events may\r\nstill turn up beyond the limits of that discretion. Unable in\r\nsuch case to consult his government, a zealous citizen will act as\r\nhe believes that would direct him were it apprized of the circumstances,\r\nand will take on himself the responsibility. In all these\r\ncases the purity and patriotism of the motives should shield the\r\nagent from blame, and even secure the sanction where the error\r\nis not too injurious. Should it be thought by any that the\r\nverbal instructions said to have been given by Commodore Barron\r\nto Mr. Eaton amount to a stipulation that the United States\r\nshould place Hamet Caramalli on the throne of Tripoli, a stipulation\r\nso entirely unauthorized, so far beyond our views, and so\r\nonerous, could not be sanctioned by our government; or should\r\nHamet Caramalli, contrary to the evidence of his letters of January\r\n3d and June 29th, be thought to have left the position which\r\nhe now seems to regret, under a mistaken expectation that we\r\nwere at all events to place him on his throne, on an appeal to the\r\nliberality of the nation something equivalent to the replacing him\r\nin his former situation, might be worthy its consideration.\r\n\r\nA nation, by establishing a character of liberality and magnanimity,\r\ngains in the friendship and respect of others more than the\r\nworth of mere money. This appeal is now made by Hamet\r\nCaramalli to the United States. The ground he has taken being\r\ndifferent not only from our views but from those expressed by\r\nhimself on former occasions, Mr. Eaton was desired to state\r\nwhether any verbal communications passed from him to Hamet,\r\nwhich had varied what we saw in writing. His answer of December\r\n5th is herewith transmitted, and has rendered it still more\r\nnecessary, that in presenting to the legislature the application of\r\nHamet, I should present them at the same time an exact statement\r\nof the views and proceedings of the executive through this\r\nwhole business, that they may clearly understand the ground\r\non which we are placed. It is accompanied by all the papers\r\nwhich bear any relation to the principles of the co-operation,\r\nand which can inform their judgment in deciding on the application\r\nof Hamet Caramalli.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE--JANUARY 17, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nIn my message to both houses of Congress at the opening of\r\ntheir present session, I submitted to their attention, among other\r\nsubjects, the oppression of our commerce and navigation by the\r\nirregular practices of armed vessels, public and private, and by\r\nthe introduction of new principles, derogatory of the rights of\r\nneutrals, and unacknowledged by the usage of nations.\r\n\r\nThe memorials of several bodies of merchants of the United\r\nStates are now communicated, and will develop these principles\r\nand practices which are producing the most ruinous effects on\r\nour lawful commerce and navigation.\r\n\r\nThe rights of a neutral to carry on a commercial intercourse\r\nwith every part of the dominions of a belligerent, permitted by\r\nthe laws of the country (with the exception of blockaded ports\r\nand contraband of war), was believed to have been decided between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States by the sentence of\r\nthe commissioners mutually appointed to decide on that and\r\nother questions of difference between the two nations, and by\r\nthe actual payment of damages awarded by them against Great\r\nBritain for the infractions of that right. When, therefore, it was\r\nperceived that the same principle was revived with others more\r\nnovel, and extending the injury, instructions were given to the\r\nminister plenipotentiary of the United States at the court of London,\r\nand remonstrances duly made by him on this subject, as\r\nwill appear by documents transmitted herewith. These were\r\nfollowed by a partial and temporary suspension only, without\r\nany disavowal of the principle. He has therefore been instructed\r\nto urge this subject anew, to bring it more fully to the bar of\r\nreason, and to insist on the rights too evident and too important\r\nto be surrendered. In the meantime, the evil is proceeding\r\nunder adjudications founded on the principle which is denied.\r\nUnder these circumstances the subject presents itself for the consideration\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nOn the impressment of our seamen our remonstrances have\r\nnever been intermitted. A hope existed at one moment of an\r\narrangement which might have been submitted to, but it soon\r\npassed away, and the practice, though relaxed at times in the\r\ndistant seas, has been constantly pursued in those in our neighborhood.\r\nThe grounds on which the reclamations on this subject\r\nhave been urged, will appear in an extract from instructions\r\nto our minister at London now communicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--FEBRUARY 3, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nA letter has been received from the Governor of South Carolina,\r\ncovering an act of the legislature of that state, ceding to the\r\nUnited States various forts and fortifications, and sites for the erection\r\nof forts in that state, on the conditions therein expressed. This\r\nletter and the act it covered are now communicated to Congress.\r\n\r\nI am not informed whether the positions ceded are the best\r\nwhich can be taken for securing their respective objects. No\r\ndoubt is entertained that the legislature deemed them such. The\r\nriver of Beaufort particularly, said to be accessible to ships of\r\nvery large size, and capable of yielding them a protection which\r\nthey cannot find elsewhere, but very far to the north, is, from\r\nthese circumstances, so interesting to the Union in general, as to\r\nmerit particular attention and inquiry, as to the positions on it\r\nbest calculated for health as well as safety.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--FEBRUARY 19, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of a measure submitted to Congress by a message\r\nof January 18th, 1803, and sanctioned by their appropriation for\r\ncarrying it into execution, Captain Meriwether Lewis, of the\r\nfirst regiment of infantry, was appointed, with a party of men, to\r\nexplore the river Missouri from its mouth to its source; and,\r\ncrossing the highlands by the shortest portage, to seek the best\r\nwater communication thence to the Pacific ocean; and Lieutenant\r\nClarke was appointed second in command. They were to\r\nenter into conference with the Indian nation on their route, with\r\na view to the establishment of commerce with them. They entered\r\nthe Missouri, May 14th, 1804, and on the 1st of November,\r\ntook up their winter quarters near the Maudan towns, 1609 miles\r\nabove the mouth of the river, in latitude 47° 21´ 47´´ north, and\r\nlongitude 99° 24´ 45´´ west, from Greenwich. On the 8th of\r\nApril, 1805, they proceeded up the river in pursuance of the objects\r\nprescribed to them. A letter of the preceding day, April\r\nthe 7th, from Captain Lewis, is herewith communicated. During\r\nhis stay among the Maudans', he had been able to lay down\r\nthe Missouri according to courses and distances taken under his\r\npassage up it, corrected by frequent observations of longitude\r\nand latitude, and to add to the actual survey of this portion of\r\nthe river, a general map of the country between the Mississippi\r\nand Pacific, from the thirty-fourth to the fifty-fourth degrees of\r\nlatitude. These additions are from information collected from\r\nIndians with whom he had opportunity of communicating during\r\nhis journey and residence among them. Copies of this map are\r\nnow presented to both houses of Congress. With these I communicate,\r\nalso, a statistical view, procured and forwarded by\r\nhim, of the Indian nations inhabiting the territory of Louisiana,\r\nand the countries adjacent to its northern and western borders;\r\nof their commerce, and of other interesting circumstances respecting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn order to render the statement as complete as may be, of the\r\nIndians inhabiting the country west of the Mississippi, I add Dr.\r\nSibley's account of those residing in and adjacent to the territory\r\nof Orleans.\r\n\r\nI communicate also, from the same person, an account of the\r\nRed river, according to the best information he had been able to\r\ncollect.\r\n\r\nHaving been disappointed, after considerable preparation, in\r\nthe purpose of sending an exploring expedition up that river in\r\nthe summer of 1804, it was thought best to employ the autumn\r\nin that year in procuring a knowledge on an interesting branch\r\nof the river called Washita. This was undertaken under the direction\r\nof Mr. Dunbar, of Natchez, a citizen of distinguished\r\nscience, who had aided, and continues to aid us with his disinterested\r\nvaluable services in the prosecution of these enterprises.\r\nHe ascended the river to the remarkable hot springs near it, in\r\nlatitude 34° 31´ 4´´.16, longitude, 92° 50´ 45´´ west, from Greenwich,\r\ntaking its courses and distances, and correcting them by\r\nfrequent celestial observations. Extracts from his observations,\r\nand copies of his map of the river, from its mouth to the hot\r\nsprings, make part of the present communications. The examination\r\nof the Red river itself is but now commencing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--MARCH 20, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nIt was reasonably expected, that while the limits between the\r\nterritories of the United States and of Spain were unsettled,\r\nneither party would have innovated on the existing state of their\r\nrespective positions. Some time since, however, we learned that\r\nthe Spanish authorities were advancing into the disputed country\r\nto occupy new posts and make new settlements. Unwilling\r\nto take any measures which might preclude a peaceable accommodation\r\nof differences, the officers of the United States were\r\nordered to confine themselves within the country on this side of\r\nthe Sabine river; which, by the delivery of its principal post\r\n(Natchitoches), was understood to have been itself delivered up\r\nby Spain; and at the same time to permit no adverse post to be\r\ntaken, nor armed men to remain within it. In consequence of\r\nthese orders, the commanding officer of Natchitoches, learning\r\nthat a party of Spanish troops had crossed the Sabine river and\r\nwere posting themselves on this side the Adais, sent a detachment\r\nof his force to require them to withdraw to the other side\r\nof the Sabine, which they accordingly did.\r\n\r\nI have thought it proper to communicate to Congress the letters\r\ndetailing this incident, that they may fully understand the\r\nstate of things in that quarter, and be enabled to make such provision\r\nfor its security as in their wisdom they shall deem sufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--APRIL 14, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nDuring the blockade of Tripoli by the squadron of the United\r\nStates, a small cruiser, under the flag of Tunis, with two prizes\r\n(all of trifling value,) attempted to enter Tripoli, was turned back,\r\nwarned, and attempting again to enter, was taken and detained as\r\na prize by the squadron. Her restitution was claimed by the\r\nbey of Tunis, with a threat of war so serious, that, on withdrawing\r\nfrom the blockade of Tripoli, the commanding officer\r\nof the squadron thought it his duty to repair to Tunis with his\r\nsquadron, and to require a categorical declaration whether peace\r\nor war was intended. The bey preferred explaining himself\r\nby an ambassador to the United States, who, on his arrival, renewed\r\nthe request that the vessel and her prizes should be restored.\r\nIt was deemed proper to give this proof of friendship\r\nto the bey, and the ambassador was informed the vessels would\r\nbe restored. Afterward he made a requisition of naval stores to\r\nbe sent to the bey, in order to secure peace for the term of three\r\nyears, with a threat of war if refused. It has been refused, and\r\nthe ambassador is about to depart without receding from his\r\nthreat or demand.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, and considering that the several\r\nprovisions of the act, March 25th, 1804, will cease in consequence\r\nof the ratification of the treaty of peace with Tripoli,\r\nnow advised to and consented to by the Senate, I have thought\r\nit my duty to communicate these facts, in order that Congress\r\nmay consider the expediency of continuing the same provisions\r\nfor a limited time or making others equivalent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIXTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.--DECEMBER 2, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates in Congress assembled_:--\r\n\r\nIt would have given me, fellow citizens, great satisfaction to\r\nannounce in the moment of your meeting that the difficulties in\r\nour foreign relations, existing at the time of your last separation,\r\nhad been amicably and justly terminated. I lost no time in taking\r\nthose measures which were most likely to bring them to such\r\na termination, by special missions charged with such powers and\r\ninstructions as in the event of failure could leave no imputation\r\non either our moderation or forbearance. The delays which\r\nhave since taken place in our negotiations with the British\r\ngovernment appears to have proceeded from causes which do\r\nnot forbid the expectation that during the course of the session I\r\nmay be enabled to lay before you their final issue. What will\r\nbe that of the negotiations for settling our differences with Spain,\r\nnothing which had taken place at the date of the last despatches\r\nenables us to pronounce. On the western side of the Mississippi\r\nshe advanced in considerable force, and took post at the settlement\r\nof Bayou Pierre, on the Red river. This village was\r\noriginally settled by France, was held by her as long as she held\r\nLouisiana, and was delivered to Spain only as a part of Louisiana.\r\nBeing small, insulated, and distant, it was not observed, at\r\nthe moment of redelivery to France and the United States, that\r\nshe continued a guard of half a dozen men which had been stationed\r\nthere. A proposition, however, having been lately made\r\nby our commander-in-chief, to assume the Sabine river as a temporary\r\nline of separation between the troops of the two nations\r\nuntil the issue of our negotiation shall be known; this has been\r\nreferred by the Spanish commandant to his superior, and in the\r\nmeantime, he has withdrawn his force to the western side\r\nof the Sabine river. The correspondence on this subject, now\r\ncommunicated, will exhibit more particularly the present state of\r\nthings in that quarter.\r\n\r\nThe nature of that country requires indispensably that an unusual\r\nproportion of the force employed there should be cavalry\r\nor mounted infantry. In order, therefore, that the commanding\r\nofficer might be enabled to act with effect, I had authorized\r\nhim to call on the governors of Orleans and Mississippi for a\r\ncorps of five hundred volunteer cavalry. The temporary arrangement\r\nhe has proposed may perhaps render this unnecessary.\r\nBut I inform you with great pleasure of the promptitude with\r\nwhich the inhabitants of those territories have tendered their\r\nservices in defence of their country. It has done honor to themselves,\r\nentitled them to the confidence of their fellow-citizens in\r\nevery part of the Union, and must strengthen the general determination\r\nto protect them efficaciously under all circumstances\r\nwhich may occur.\r\n\r\nHaving received information that in another part of the United\r\nStates a great number of private individuals were combining\r\ntogether, arming and organizing themselves contrary to law, to\r\ncarry on military expeditions against the territories of Spain, I\r\nthought it necessary, by proclamations as well as by special orders,\r\nto take measures for preventing and suppressing this enterprise,\r\nfor seizing the vessels, arms, and other means provided\r\nfor it, and for arresting and bringing to justice its authors and\r\nabettors. It was due to that good faith which ought ever to be\r\nthe rule of action in public as well as in private transactions; it\r\nwas due to good order and regular government, that while the\r\npublic force was acting strictly on the defensive and merely to\r\nprotect our citizens from aggression, the criminal attempts of\r\nprivate individuals to decide for their country the question of\r\npeace or war, by commencing active and unauthorized hostilities,\r\nshould be promptly and efficaciously suppressed.\r\n\r\nWhether it will be necessary to enlarge our regular force will\r\ndepend on the result of our negotiation with Spain; but as it is\r\nuncertain when that result will be known, the provisional measures\r\nrequisite for that, and to meet any pressure intervening in\r\nthat quarter, will be a subject for your early consideration.\r\n\r\nThe possession of both banks of the Mississippi reducing to a\r\nsingle point the defence of that river, its waters, and the country\r\nadjacent, it becomes highly necessary to provide for that point a\r\nmore adequate security. Some position above its mouth, commanding\r\nthe passage of the river, should be rendered sufficiently\r\nstrong to cover the armed vessels which may be stationed there\r\nfor defence, and in conjunction with them to present an insuperable\r\nobstacle to any force attempting to pass. The approaches to\r\nthe city of New Orleans, from the eastern quarter also, will require\r\nto be examined, and more effectually guarded. For the\r\ninternal support of the country, the encouragement of a strong\r\nsettlement on the western side of the Mississippi, within reach\r\nof New Orleans, will be worthy the consideration of the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe gun-boats authorized by an act of the last session are so\r\nadvanced that they will be ready for service in the ensuing\r\nspring. Circumstances permitted us to allow the time necessary\r\nfor their more solid construction. As a much larger number will\r\nstill be wanting to place our seaport towns and waters in that\r\nstate of defence to which we are competent and they entitled, a\r\nsimilar appropriation for a further provision for them is recommended\r\nfor the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nA further appropriation will also be necessary for repairing fortifications\r\nalready established, and the erection of such works as\r\nmay have real effect in obstructing the approach of an enemy to\r\nour seaport towns, or their remaining before them.\r\n\r\nIn a country whose constitution is derived from the will of\r\nthe people, directly expressed by their free suffrages; where the\r\nprincipal executive functionaries, and those of the legislature,\r\nare renewed by them at short periods; where under the characters\r\nof jurors, they exercise in person the greatest portion of the\r\njudiciary powers; where the laws are consequently so formed\r\nand administered as to bear with equal weight and favor on all,\r\nrestraining no man in the pursuits of honest industry, and securing\r\nto every one the property which that acquires, it would not\r\nbe supposed that any safeguards could be needed against insurrection\r\nor enterprise on the public peace or authority. The\r\nlaws, however, aware that these should not be trusted to moral\r\nrestraints only, have wisely provided punishments for these\r\ncrimes when committed. But would it not be salutary to give\r\nalso the means of preventing their commission? Where an enterprise\r\nis meditated by private individuals against a foreign nation\r\nin amity with the United States, powers of prevention to a\r\ncertain extent are given by the laws; would they not be as\r\nreasonable and useful were the enterprise preparing against the\r\nUnited States? While adverting to this branch of the law, it is\r\nproper to observe, that in enterprises meditated against foreign\r\nnations, the ordinary process of binding to the observance of the\r\npeace and good behavior, could it be extended to acts to be done\r\nout of the jurisdiction of the United States, would be effectual\r\nin some cases where the offender is able to keep out of sight\r\nevery indication of his purpose which could draw on him the\r\nexercise of the powers now given by law.\r\n\r\nThe states on the coast of Barbary seem generally disposed at\r\npresent to respect our peace and friendship; with Tunis alone\r\nsome uncertainty remains. Persuaded that it is our interest to\r\nmaintain our peace with them on equal terms, or not at all, I propose\r\nto send in due time a reinforcement into the Mediterranean, unless\r\nprevious information shall show it to be unnecessary.\r\n\r\nWe continue to receive proofs of the growing attachment of\r\nour Indian neighbors, and of their disposition to place all their\r\ninterests under the patronage of the United States. These dispositions\r\nare inspired by their confidence in our justice, and in\r\nthe sincere concern we feel for their welfare; and as long as we\r\ndischarge these high and honorable functions with the integrity\r\nand good faith which alone can entitle us to their continuance, we\r\nmay expect to reap the just reward in their peace and friendship.\r\n\r\nThe expedition of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, for exploring the\r\nriver Missouri, and the best communication from that to the\r\nPacific ocean, has had all the success which could have been\r\nexpected. They have traced the Missouri nearly to its source,\r\ndescended the Columbia to the Pacific ocean, ascertained with\r\naccuracy the geography of that interesting communication across\r\nour continent, learned the character of the country, of its commerce,\r\nand inhabitants; and it is but justice to say that Messrs.\r\nLewis and Clarke, and their brave companions, have by this arduous\r\nservice deserved well of their country.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to explore the Red river, under the direction of\r\nMr. Freeman, though conducted with a zeal and prudence meriting\r\nentire approbation, has not been equally successful. After\r\nproceeding up it about six hundred miles, nearly as far as the\r\nFrench settlements had extended while the country was in their\r\npossession, our geographers were obliged to return without completing\r\ntheir work.\r\n\r\nVery useful additions have also been made to our knowledge\r\nof the Mississippi by Lieutenant Pike, who has ascended to its\r\nsource, and whose journal and map, giving the details of the\r\njourney, will shortly be ready for communication to both houses\r\nof Congress. Those of Messrs. Lewis and Clarke, and Freeman,\r\nwill require further time to be digested and prepared. These\r\nimportant surveys, in addition to those before possessed, furnish\r\nmaterials for commencing an accurate map of the Mississippi,\r\nand its western waters. Some principal rivers, however, remain\r\nstill to be explored, toward which the authorization of Congress,\r\nby moderate appropriations, will be requisite.\r\n\r\nI congratulate you, fellow citizens, on the approach of the\r\nperiod at which you may interpose your authority constitutionally,\r\nto withdraw the citizens of the United States from all further\r\nparticipation in those violations of human rights which have\r\nbeen so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa,\r\nand which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of\r\nour country, have long been eager to proscribe. Although no\r\nlaw you may pass can take prohibitory effect till the first day of\r\nthe year one thousand eight hundred and eight, yet the intervening\r\nperiod is not too long to prevent, by timely notice, expeditions\r\nwhich cannot be completed before that day.\r\n\r\nThe receipts at the treasury during the year ending on the\r\n30th of September last, have amounted to near fifteen millions\r\nof dollars, which have enabled us, after meeting the current demands,\r\nto pay two millions seven hundred thousand dollars of\r\nthe American claims, in parts of the price of Louisiana; to pay\r\nof the funded debt upward of three millions of principal, and\r\nnearly four of interest; and in addition, to reimburse, in the\r\ncourse of the present month, near two millions of five and a half\r\nper cent. stock. These payments and reimbursements of the\r\nfunded debt, with those which have been made in four years\r\nand a half preceding, will, at the close of the present year, have\r\nextinguished upward of twenty-three millions of principal.\r\n\r\nThe duties composing the Mediterranean fund will cease by\r\nlaw at the end of the present season. Considering, however,\r\nthat they are levied chiefly on luxuries, and that we have an\r\nimpost on salt, a necessary of life, the free use of which otherwise\r\nis so important, I recommend to your consideration the suppression\r\nof the duties on salt, and the continuation of the\r\nMediterranean fund, instead thereof, for a short time, after which\r\nthat also will become unnecessary for any purpose now within\r\ncontemplation.\r\n\r\nWhen both of these branches of revenue shall in this way be\r\nrelinquished, there will still ere long be an accumulation of\r\nmoneys in the treasury beyond the instalments of public debt\r\nwhich we are permitted by contract to pay. They cannot, then,\r\nwithout a modification assented to by the public creditors, be\r\napplied to the extinguishment of this debt, and the complete\r\nliberation of our revenues--the most desirable of all objects; nor,\r\nif our peace continues, will they be wanting for any other existing\r\npurpose. The question, therefore, now comes forward,--to\r\nwhat other objects shall these surpluses be appropriated, and the\r\nwhole surplus of impost, after the entire discharge of the public\r\ndebt, and during those intervals when the purposes of war shall\r\nnot call for them? Shall we suppress the impost and give that\r\nadvantage to foreign over domestic manufactures? On a few\r\narticles of more general and necessary use, the suppression in due\r\nseason will doubtless be right, but the great mass of the articles\r\non which impost is paid is foreign luxuries, purchased by those\r\nonly who are rich enough to afford themselves the use of them.\r\nTheir patriotism would certainly prefer its continuance and application\r\nto the great purposes of the public education, roads,\r\nrivers, canals, and such other objects of public improvement as it\r\nmay be thought proper to add to the constitutional enumeration\r\nof federal powers. By these operations new channels of communication\r\nwill be opened between the States; the lines of separation\r\nwill disappear, their interests will be identified, and their\r\nunion cemented by new and indissoluble ties. Education is\r\nhere placed among the articles of public care, not that it would\r\nbe proposed to take its ordinary branches out of the hands of\r\nprivate enterprise, which manages so much better all the concerns\r\nto which it is equal; but a public institution can alone supply\r\nthose sciences which, though rarely called for, are yet\r\nnecessary to complete the circle, all the parts of which contribute\r\nto the improvement of the country, and some of them to its preservation.\r\nThe subject is now proposed for the consideration\r\nof Congress, because, if approved by the time the State legislatures\r\nshall have deliberated on this extension of the federal\r\ntrusts, and the laws shall be passed, and other arrangements\r\nmade for their execution, the necessary funds will be on hand\r\nand without employment. I suppose an amendment to the constitution,\r\nby consent of the States, necessary, because the objects\r\nnow recommended are not among those enumerated in the\r\nconstitution, and to which it permits the public moneys to be\r\napplied.\r\n\r\nThe present consideration of a national establishment for education,\r\nparticularly, is rendered proper by this circumstance also,\r\nthat if Congress, approving the proposition, shall yet think it more\r\neligible to found it on a donation of lands, they have it now in\r\ntheir power to endow it with those which will be among the\r\nearliest to produce the necessary income. This foundation would\r\nhave the advantage of being independent on war, which may\r\nsuspend other improvements by requiring for its own purposes\r\nthe resources destined for them.\r\n\r\nThis, fellow citizens, is the state of the public interest at the\r\npresent moment, and according to the information now possessed.\r\nBut such is the situation of the nations of Europe, and such\r\ntoo the predicament in which we stand with some of them, that\r\nwe cannot rely with certainty on the present aspect of our affairs\r\nthat may change from moment to moment, during the course of\r\nyour session or after you shall have separated. Our duty is,\r\ntherefore, to act upon things as they are, and to make a reasonable\r\nprovision for whatever they may be. Were armies to be\r\nraised whenever a speck of war is visible in our horizon, we\r\nnever should have been without them. Our resources would\r\nhave been exhausted on dangers which have never happened,\r\ninstead of being reserved for what is really to take place. A\r\nsteady, perhaps a quickened pace in preparations for the defence\r\nof our seaport towns and waters; an early settlement of the most\r\nexposed and vulnerable parts of our country; a militia so organized\r\nthat its effective portions can be called to any point in the\r\nUnion, or volunteers instead of them to serve a sufficient time,\r\nare means which may always be ready yet never preying on our\r\nresources until actually called into use. They will maintain the\r\npublic interests while a more permanent force shall be in course\r\nof preparation. But much will depend on the promptitude with\r\nwhich these means can be brought into activity. If war be\r\nforced upon us in spite of our long and vain appeals to the justice\r\nof nations, rapid and vigorous movements in its outset will\r\ngo far toward securing us in its course and issue, and toward\r\nthrowing its burdens on those who render necessary the resort\r\nfrom reason to force.\r\n\r\nThe result of our negotiations, or such incidents in their course\r\nas may enable us to infer their probable issue; such further\r\nmovements also on our western frontiers as may show whether\r\nwar is to be pressed there while negotiation is protracted elsewhere,\r\nshall be communicated to you from time to time as they\r\nbecome known to me, with whatever other information I possess\r\nor may receive, which may aid your deliberations on the great\r\nnational interests committed to your charge.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE--DECEMBER 3, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nI have the satisfaction to inform you that the negotiation depending\r\nbetween the United States and the government of Great\r\nBritain is proceeding in a spirit of friendship and accommodation\r\nwhich promises a result of mutual advantage. Delays indeed\r\nhave taken place, occasioned by the long illness and subsequent\r\ndeath of the British minister charged with that duty. But the\r\ncommissioners appointed by that government to resume the negotiation\r\nhave shown every disposition to hasten its progress. It\r\nis, however, a work of time, as many arrangements are necessary\r\nto place our future harmony on stable grounds. In the meantime,\r\nwe find by the communications of our plenipotentiaries,\r\nthat a temporary suspension of the act of the last session prohibiting\r\ncertain importations, would, as a mark of candid disposition\r\non our part, and of confidence in the temper and views\r\nwith which they have been met, have a happy effect on its\r\ncourse. A step so friendly will afford further evidence that all\r\nour proceedings have flowed from views of justice and conciliation,\r\nand that we give them willingly that form which may\r\nbest meet corresponding dispositions.\r\n\r\nAdd to this, that the same motives which produced the postponement\r\nof the act till the fifteenth of November last, are in\r\nfavor of its further suspension; and as we have reason to hope\r\nthat it may soon yield to arrangements of mutual consent and\r\nconvenience, justice seems to require that the same measure may\r\nbe dealt out to the few cases which may fall within its short\r\ncourse, as to all others preceding and following it. I cannot,\r\ntherefore, but recommend the suspension of this act for a reasonable\r\ntime, on considerations of justice, amity, and the public\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--JANUARY 22, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the request of the House of Representatives,\r\ncommunicated in their resolution of the sixteenth instant, I proceed\r\nto state under the reserve therein expressed, information received\r\ntouching an illegal combination of private individuals\r\nagainst the peace and safety of the Union, and a military expedition\r\nplanned by them against the territories of a power in amity\r\nwith the United States, with the measures I have pursued for\r\nsuppressing the same.\r\n\r\nI had for some time been in the constant expectation of receiving\r\nsuch further information as would have enabled me to\r\nlay before the legislature the termination as well as the beginning\r\nand progress of this scene of depravity, so far as it has been\r\nacted on the Ohio and its waters. From this the state and safety\r\nof the lower country might have been estimated on probable\r\ngrounds, and the delay was indulged the rather, because no circumstance\r\nhad yet made it necessary to call in the aid of the\r\nlegislative functions. Information now recently communicated\r\nhas brought us nearly to the period contemplated. The mass of\r\nwhat I have received, in the course of these transactions, is voluminous,\r\nbut little has been given under the sanction of an oath,\r\nso as to constitute formal and legal evidence. It is chiefly in\r\nthe form of letters, often containing such a mixture of rumors,\r\nconjectures, and suspicions, as render it difficult to sift out the\r\nreal facts, and unadvisable to hazard more than general outlines,\r\nstrengthened by concurrent information, or the particular credibility\r\nof the relater. In this state of the evidence, delivered\r\nsometimes too under the restriction of private confidence, neither\r\nsafety nor justice will permit the exposing names, except that\r\nof the principal actor, whose guilt is placed beyond question.\r\n\r\nSome time in the latter part of September, I received intimations\r\nthat designs were in agitation in the western country,\r\nunlawful and unfriendly to the peace of the Union; and that\r\nthe prime mover in these was Aaron Burr, heretofore distinguished\r\nby the favor of his country. The grounds of these\r\nintimations being inconclusive, the objects uncertain, and the\r\nfidelity of that country known to be firm, the only measure taken\r\nwas to urge the informants to use their best endeavors to get\r\nfurther insight into the designs and proceedings of the suspected\r\npersons, and to communicate them to me.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the latter part of October, that the objects of\r\nthe conspiracy began to be perceived, but still so blended and\r\ninvolved in mystery that nothing distinct could be singled out\r\nfor pursuit. In this state of uncertainty as to the crime contemplated,\r\nthe acts done, and the legal course to be pursued, I thought\r\nit best to send to the scene where these things were principally\r\nin transaction, a person, in whose integrity, understanding, and\r\ndiscretion, entire confidence could be reposed, with instructions\r\nto investigate the plots going on, to enter into conference (for\r\nwhich he had sufficient credentials) with the governors and all\r\nother officers, civil and military, and with their aid to do on the\r\nspot whatever should be necessary to discover the designs of the\r\nconspirators, arrest their means, bring their persons to punishment,\r\nand to call out the force of the country to suppress any\r\nunlawful enterprise in which it should be found they were engaged.\r\nBy this time it was known that many boats were under\r\npreparation, stores of provisions collecting, and an unusual number\r\nof suspicious characters in motion on the Ohio and its waters.\r\nBesides despatching the confidential agent to that quarter, orders\r\nwere at the same time sent to the governors of the Orleans and\r\nMississippi territories, and to the commanders of the land and\r\nnaval forces there, to be on their guard against surprise, and in\r\nconstant readiness to resist any enterprise which might be attempted\r\non the vessels, posts, or other objects under their care;\r\nand on the 8th of November, instructions were forwarded to\r\nGeneral Wilkinson to hasten an accommodation with the Spanish\r\ncommander on the Sabine, and as soon as that was effected,\r\nto fall back with his principal force to the hither bank of the\r\nMississippi, for the defence of the intersecting points on that\r\nriver. By a letter received from that officer on the 25th of November,\r\nbut dated October 21st, we learn that a confidential\r\nagent of Aaron Burr had been deputed to him, with communications\r\npartly written in cipher and partly oral, explaining his designs,\r\nexaggerating his resources, and making such offers of\r\nemolument and command, to engage him and the army in his\r\nunlawful enterprise, as he had flattered himself would be successful.\r\nThe general, with the honor of a soldier and fidelity\r\nof a good citizen, immediately despatched a trusty officer to me\r\nwith information of what had passed, proceeding to establish\r\nsuch an understanding with the Spanish commandant on the\r\nSabine as permitted him to withdraw his force across the Mississippi,\r\nand to enter on measures for opposing the projected enterprise.\r\n\r\nThe general's letter, which came to hand on the 25th of November,\r\nas has been mentioned, and some other information received\r\na few days earlier, when brought together, developed\r\nBurr's general designs, different parts of which only had been\r\nrevealed to different informants. It appeared that he contemplated\r\ntwo distinct objects, which might be carried on either\r\njointly or separately, and either the one or the other first, as circumstances\r\nshould direct. One of these was the severance of\r\nthe Union of these States by the Alleghany mountains; the\r\nother, an attack on Mexico. A third object was provided, merely\r\nostensible, to wit: the settlement of a pretended purchase of a\r\ntract of country on the Washita, claimed by a Baron Bastrop.\r\nThis was to serve as the pretext for all his preparations, an allurement\r\nfor such followers as really wished to acquire settlements\r\nin that country, and a cover under which to retreat in the\r\nevent of final discomfiture of both branches of his real design.\r\n\r\nHe found at once that the attachment of the western country\r\nto the present Union was not to be shaken; that its dissolution\r\ncould not be effected with the consent of its inhabitants, and\r\nthat his resources were inadequate, as yet, to effect it by force.\r\nHe took his course then at once, determined to seize on New\r\nOrleans, plunder the bank there, possess himself of the military\r\nand naval stores, and proceed on his expedition to Mexico; and\r\nto this object all his means and preparations were now directed.\r\nHe collected from all the quarters where himself or his agents\r\npossessed influence, all the ardent, restless, desperate, and disaffected\r\npersons who were ready for any enterprise analogous to\r\ntheir characters. He seduced good and well-meaning citizens,\r\nsome by assurances that he possessed the confidence of the government\r\nand was acting under its secret patronage, a pretence\r\nwhich obtained some credit from the state of our differences\r\nwith Spain; and others by offers of land in Bastrop's claim on\r\nthe Washita.\r\n\r\nThis was the state of my information of his proceedings about\r\nthe last of November, at which time, therefore, it was first possible\r\nto take specific measures to meet them. The proclamation\r\nof November 27th, two days after the receipt of General Wilkinson's\r\ninformation, was now issued. Orders were despatched\r\nto every intersecting point on the Ohio and Mississippi, from\r\nPittsburg to New Orleans, for the employment of such force\r\neither of the regulars or of the militia, and of such proceedings\r\nalso of the civil authorities, as might enable them to seize on\r\nall the boats and stores provided for the enterprise, to arrest the\r\npersons concerned, and to suppress effectually the further progress\r\nof the enterprise. A little before the receipt of these orders\r\nin the State of Ohio, our confidential agent, who had been\r\ndiligently employed in investigating the conspiracy, had acquired\r\nsufficient information to open himself to the governor of\r\nthat State, and apply for the immediate exertion of the authority\r\nand power of the State to crush the combination. Governor\r\nTiffin and the legislature, with a promptitude, an energy, and\r\npatriotic zeal, which entitle them to a distinguished place in the\r\naffection of their sister States, effected the seizure of all the\r\nboats, provisions, and other preparations within their reach, and\r\nthus gave a first blow, materially disabling the enterprise in its\r\noutset.\r\n\r\nIn Kentucky, a premature attempt to bring Burr to justice,\r\nwithout sufficient evidence for his conviction, had produced a\r\npopular impression in his favor, and a general disbelief of his\r\nguilt. This gave him an unfortunate opportunity of hastening\r\nhis equipments. The arrival of the proclamation and orders,\r\nand the application and information of our confidential agent, at\r\nlength awakened the authorities of that State to the truth, and\r\nthen produced the same promptitude and energy of which the\r\nneighboring State had set the example. Under an act of their\r\nlegislature of December 23d, militia was instantly ordered to\r\ndifferent important points, and measures taken for doing whatever\r\ncould yet be done. Some boats (accounts vary from five\r\nto double or treble that number) and persons (differently estimated\r\nfrom one to three hundred) had in the meantime passed\r\nthe falls of the Ohio, to rendezvous at the mouth of the Cumberland,\r\nwith others expected down that river.\r\n\r\nNot apprized, till very late, that any boats were building on\r\nCumberland, the effect of the proclamation had been trusted to\r\nfor some time in the State of Tennessee; but on the 19th of\r\nDecember, similar communications and instructions with those\r\nof the neighboring States were despatched by express to the\r\ngovernor, and a general officer of the western division of the\r\nState, and on the 23d of December our confidential agent left\r\nFrankfort for Nashville, to put into activity the means of that\r\nState also. But by information received yesterday, I learn that\r\non the 22d of December, Mr. Burr descended the Cumberland\r\nwith two boats merely of accommodation, carrying with him\r\nfrom that State no quota toward his unlawful enterprise. Whether\r\nafter the arrival of the proclamation, of the orders, or of our\r\nagent, any exertion which could be made by that State, or the\r\norders of the governor of Kentucky for calling out the militia at\r\nthe mouth of Cumberland, would be in time to arrest these boats,\r\nand those from the falls of the Ohio, is still doubtful.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the fugitives from Ohio, with their associates\r\nfrom Cumberland, or any other place in that quarter, cannot\r\nthreaten serious danger to the city of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nBy the same express of December nineteenth, orders were\r\nsent to the governors of New Orleans and Mississippi, supplementary\r\nto those which had been given on the twenty-fifth\r\nof November, to hold the militia of their territories in readiness\r\nto co-operate for their defence, with the regular troops and armed\r\nvessels then under command of General Wilkinson. Great\r\nalarm, indeed, was excited at New Orleans by the exaggerated\r\naccounts of Mr. Burr, disseminated through his emissaries, of the\r\narmies and navies he was to assemble there. General Wilkinson\r\nhad arrived there himself on the 24th of November, and had\r\nimmediately put into activity the resources of the place for the\r\npurpose of its defence; and on the tenth of December he was\r\njoined by his troops from the Sabine. Great zeal was shown\r\nby the inhabitants generally, the merchants of the place readily\r\nagreeing to the most laudable exertions and sacrifices for manning\r\nthe armed vessels with their seamen, and the other citizens\r\nmanifesting unequivocal fidelity to the Union, and a spirit of\r\ndetermined resistance to their expected assailants.\r\n\r\nSurmises have been hazarded that this enterprise is to receive\r\naid from certain foreign powers. But these surmises are without\r\nproof or probability. The wisdom of the measures sanctioned\r\nby Congress at its last session had placed us in the paths of peace\r\nand justice with the only powers with whom we had any differences,\r\nand nothing has happened since which makes it either\r\ntheir interest or ours to pursue another course. No change of\r\nmeasures has taken place on our part; none ought to take\r\nplace at this time. With the one, friendly arrangement was\r\nthen proposed, and the law deemed necessary on the failure of\r\nthat was suspended to give time for a fair trial of the issue.\r\nWith the same power, negotiation is still preferred, and provisional\r\nmeasures only are necessary to meet the event of rupture.\r\nWhile, therefore, we do not deflect in the slightest degree from\r\nthe course we then assumed, and are still pursuing, with mutual\r\nconsent, to restore a good understanding, we are not to impute\r\nto them practices as irreconcilable to interest as to good faith,\r\nand changing necessarily the relations of peace and justice between\r\nus to those of war. These surmises are, therefore, to be\r\nimputed to the vauntings of the author of this enterprise, to\r\nmultiply his partisans by magnifying the belief of his prospects\r\nand support.\r\n\r\nBy letters from General Wilkinson, of the 14th and 18th of\r\nSeptember, which came to hand two days after date of the resolution\r\nof the House of Representatives, that is to say, on the\r\nmorning of the 18th instant, I received the important affidavit, a\r\ncopy of which I now communicate, with extracts of so much of\r\nthe letters as come within the scope of the resolution. By these\r\nit will be seen that of three of the principal emissaries of Mr.\r\nBurr, whom the general had caused to be apprehended, one had\r\nbeen liberated by _habeas corpus_, and the two others, being those\r\nparticularly employed in the endeavor to corrupt the general and\r\narmy of the United States, have been embarked by him for our\r\nports in the Atlantic States, probably on the consideration that\r\nan impartial trial could not be expected during the present agitations\r\nof New Orleans, and that that city was not as yet a safe\r\nplace of confinement. As soon as these persons shall arrive,\r\nthey will be delivered to the custody of the law, and left to such\r\ncourse of trial, both as to place and process, as its functionaries\r\nmay direct. The presence of the highest judicial authorities,\r\nto be assembled at this place within a few days, the means of\r\npursuing a sounder course of proceedings here than elsewhere,\r\nand the aid of the executive means, should the judges have occasion\r\nto use them, render it equally desirable for the criminals\r\nas for the public, that being already removed from the place\r\nwhere they were first apprehended, the first regular arrest should\r\ntake place here, and the course of proceedings receive here its\r\nproper direction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--JANUARY 28, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nBy the letters of Captain Bissel, who commands at Fort Massac,\r\nand of Mr. Murrell, to General Jackson, of Tennessee, copies\r\nof which are now communicated to Congress, it will be seen that\r\nAaron Burr passed Fort Massac on the 31st December, with\r\nabout ten boats, navigated by about six hands each, without any\r\nmilitary appearance, and that three boats with ammunition were\r\nsaid to have been arrested by the militia at Louisville.\r\n\r\nAs the guards of militia posted on various points on the Ohio\r\nwill be able to prevent any further aids passing through that\r\nchannel, should any be attempted, we may now estimate, with\r\ntolerable certainty, the means derived from the Ohio and its waters,\r\ntoward the accomplishment of the purposes of Mr. Burr.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--JANUARY 31, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nIn execution of the act of the last session of Congress, entitled,\r\n\"An act to regulate the laying out and making a road from\r\nCumberland, in the State of Maryland, to the State of Ohio,\" I\r\nappointed Thomas Moore, of Maryland, Joseph Kerr, of Ohio,\r\nand Eli Williams, of Maryland, commissioners to lay out the said\r\nroad, and to perform the other duties assigned to them by the\r\nact. The progress which they made in the execution of the\r\nwork, during the last session, will appear in their report, now\r\ncommunicated to Congress. On the receipt of it, I took measures\r\nto obtain consent for making the road, of the States of Pennsylvania,\r\nMaryland, and Virginia, through which the commissioners\r\nproposed to lay it out. I have received acts of the legislatures\r\nof Maryland and Virginia, giving the consent desired; that\r\nof Pennsylvania has the subject still under consideration, as is\r\nsupposed. Until I receive full consent to a free choice of route\r\nthrough the whole distance, I have thought it safest neither to\r\naccept, nor reject, finally, the partial report of the commissioners.\r\nSome matters suggested in the report belong exclusively to the\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--FEBRUARY 10, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the request of the House of Representatives,\r\nexpressed in their resolution of the 5th instant, I proceed to give\r\nsuch information as is possessed, of the effect of gun-boats in the\r\nprotection and defense of harbors, of the numbers thought necessary,\r\nand of the proposed distribution of them among the ports\r\nand harbors of the United States.\r\n\r\nUnder the present circumstances, and governed by the intentions\r\nof the legislature, as manifested by their annual appropriations\r\nof money for the purposes of defence, it has been concluded\r\nto combine--1st, land batteries, furnished with heavy cannon\r\nand mortars, and established on all the points around the place\r\nfavorable for preventing vessels from lying before it; 2d, movable\r\nartillery which may be carried, as an occasion may require,\r\nto points unprovided with fixed batteries; 3d, floating batteries;\r\nand 4th, gun-boats, which may oppose an enemy at its entrance\r\nand co-operate with the batteries for his expulsion.\r\n\r\nOn this subject professional men were consulted as far as we\r\nhad opportunity. General Wilkinson, and the late General Gates,\r\ngave their opinions in writing, in favor of the system, as will be\r\nseen by their letters now communicated. The higher officers of\r\nthe navy gave the same opinions in separate conferences, as their\r\npresence at the seat of government offered occasions of consulting\r\nthem, and no difference of judgment appeared on the subjects.\r\nThose of Commodore Barron and Captain Tingey, now\r\nhere, are recently furnished in writing, and transmitted herewith\r\nto the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe efficacy of gun-boats for the defence of harbors, and of\r\nother smooth and enclosed waters, may be estimated in part from\r\nthat of galleys, formerly much used, but less powerful, more costly\r\nin their construction and maintenance, and requiring more\r\nmen. But the gun-boat itself is believed to be in use with every\r\nmodern maritime nation for the purpose of defence. In the Mediterranean,\r\non which are several small powers, whose system like\r\nours is peace and defence, few harbors are without this article of\r\nprotection. Our own experience there of the effect of gun-boats\r\nfor harbor service, is recent. Algiers is particularly known to\r\nhave owed to a great provision of these vessels the safety of its\r\ncity, since the epoch of their construction. Before that it had\r\nbeen repeatedly insulted and injured. The effect of gun-boats\r\nat present in the neighborhood of Gibraltar, is well known, and\r\nhow much they were used both in the attack and defence of that\r\nplace during a former war. The extensive resort to them by\r\nthe two greatest naval powers in the world, on an enterprise of\r\ninvasion not long since in prospect, shows their confidence in\r\ntheir efficacy for the purposes for which they are suited. By the\r\nnorthern powers of Europe, whose seas are particularly adapted\r\nto them, they are still more used. The remarkable action between\r\nthe Russian flotilla of gun-boats and galleys, and a Turkish\r\nfleet of ships-of-the-line and frigates, in the Liman sea, 1788,\r\nwill be readily recollected. The latter, commanded by their\r\nmost celebrated admiral, were completely defeated, and several\r\nof their ships-of-the-line destroyed.\r\n\r\nFrom the opinions given as to the number of gun-boats necessary\r\nfor some of the principal seaports, and from a view of all the\r\ntowns and ports from Orleans to Maine inclusive, entitled to protection,\r\nin proportion to their situation and circumstances, it is\r\nconcluded, that to give them a due measure of protection in time\r\nof war, about two hundred gun-boats will be requisite. According\r\nto first ideas, the following would be their general distribution,\r\nliable to be varied on more mature examination, and as circumstances\r\nshall vary, that is to say:--\r\n\r\nTo the Mississippi and its neighboring waters, forty gun-boats.\r\n\r\nTo Savannah and Charleston, and the harbors on each side,\r\nfrom St. Mary's to Currituck, twenty-five.\r\n\r\nTo the Chesapeake and its waters, twenty.\r\n\r\nTo Delaware bay and river, fifteen.\r\n\r\nTo New York, the Sound, and waters as far as Cape Cod,\r\nfifty.\r\n\r\nTo Boston and the harbors north of Cape Cod, fifty.\r\n\r\nThe flotilla assigned to these several stations, might each be\r\nunder the care of a particular commandant, and the vessels\r\ncomposing them would, in ordinary, be distributed among the\r\nharbors within the station in proportion to their importance.\r\n\r\nOf these boats a proper proportion would be of the larger size,\r\nsuch as those heretofore built, capable of navigating any seas,\r\nand of reinforcing occasionally the strength of even the most\r\ndistant port when menaced with danger. The residue would be\r\nconfined to their own or the neighboring harbors, would be\r\nsmaller, less furnished for accommodation, and consequently less\r\ncostly. Of the number supposed necessary, seventy-three are\r\nbuilt or building, and the hundred and twenty-seven still to be\r\nprovided, would cost from five to six hundred thousand dollars.\r\nHaving regard to the convenience of the treasury, as well as to\r\nthe resources of building, it has been thought that one half of\r\nthese might be built in the present year, and the other year the\r\nnext. With the legislature, however, it will rest to stop where\r\nwe are, or at any further point, when they shall be of opinion\r\nthat the number provided shall be sufficient for the object.\r\n\r\nAt times when Europe as well as the United States shall be at\r\npeace, it would not be proposed that more than six or eight of\r\nthese vessels should be kept afloat. When Europe is in war,\r\ntreble that number might be necessary to be distributed among\r\nthose particular harbors which foreign vessels of war are in the\r\nhabit of frequenting, for the purpose of preserving order therein.\r\n\r\nBut they would be manned, in ordinary, with only their complement\r\nfor navigation, relying on the seamen and militia of the\r\nport if called into action on sudden emergency. It would be\r\nonly when the United States should themselves be at war, that\r\nthe whole number would be brought into actual service, and\r\nwould be ready in the first moments of the war to co-operate\r\nwith other means for covering at once the line of our seaports.\r\nAt all times, those unemployed would be withdrawn into places\r\nnot exposed to sudden enterprise, hauled up under sheds from\r\nthe sun and weather, and kept in preservation with little expense\r\nfor repairs or maintenance.\r\n\r\nIt must be superfluous to observe, that this species of naval\r\narmament is proposed merely for defensive operation; that it can\r\nhave but little effect toward protecting our commerce in the open\r\nseas even on our coast; and still less can it become an excitement\r\nto engage in offensive maritime war, toward which it\r\nwould furnish no means.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEVENTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.--OCTOBER 27, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nCircumstances, fellow citizens, which seriously threatened the\r\npeace of our country, have made it a duty to convene you at an\r\nearlier period than usual. The love of peace, so much cherished\r\nin the bosoms of our citizens, which has so long guided the proceedings\r\nof the public councils, and induced forbearance under\r\nso many wrongs, may not insure our continuance in the quiet\r\npursuits of industry. The many injuries and depredations committed\r\non our commerce and navigation upon the high seas for\r\nyears past, the successive innovations on those principles of public\r\nlaw which have been established by the reason and usage of\r\nnations as the rule of their intercourse, and the umpire and security\r\nof their rights and peace, and all the circumstances which\r\ninduced the extraordinary mission to London, are already known\r\nto you. The instructions given to our ministers were framed in\r\nthe sincerest spirit of amity and moderation. They accordingly\r\nproceeded, in conformity therewith, to propose arrangements\r\nwhich might embrace and settle all the points in difference between\r\nus, which might bring us to a mutual understanding on\r\nour neutral and national rights, and provide for a commercial intercourse\r\non conditions of some equality. After long and fruitless\r\nendeavors to effect the purposes of their mission, and to obtain\r\narrangements within the limits of their instructions, they\r\nconcluded to sign such as could be obtained, and to send them\r\nfor consideration, candidly declaring to the other negotiators, at\r\nthe same time, that they were acting against their instructions,\r\nand that their government, therefore, could not be pledged for\r\nratification. Some of the articles proposed might have been admitted\r\non a principle of compromise, but others were too highly\r\ndisadvantageous, and no sufficient provision was made against\r\nthe principal source of the irritations and collisions which were\r\nconstantly endangering the peace of the two nations. The\r\nquestion, therefore, whether a treaty should be accepted in that\r\nform could have admitted but of one decision, even had no\r\ndeclarations of the other party impaired our confidence in it.\r\nStill anxious not to close the door against friendly adjustment,\r\nnew modifications were framed, and further concessions authorized\r\nthan could before have been supposed necessary; and our\r\nministers were instructed to resume their negotiations on these\r\ngrounds. On this new reference to amicable discussion, we\r\nwere reposing in confidence, when on the 22d day of June last,\r\nby a formal order from the British admiral, the frigate Chesapeake,\r\nleaving her port for distant service, was attacked by one\r\nof those vessels which had been lying in our harbors under the\r\nindulgences of hospitality, was disabled from proceeding, had\r\nseveral of her crew killed, and four taken away. On this outrage\r\nno commentaries are necessary. Its character has been\r\npronounced by the indignant voice of our citizens with an emphasis\r\nand unanimity never exceeded. I immediately, by proclamation,\r\ninterdicted our harbors and waters to all British armed\r\nvessels, forbade intercourse with them, and uncertain how far\r\nhostilities were intended, and the town of Norfolk, indeed, being\r\nthreatened with immediate attack, a sufficient force was ordered\r\nfor the protection of that place, and such other preparations\r\ncommenced and pursued as the prospect rendered proper. An\r\narmed vessel of the United States was despatched with instructions\r\nto our ministers at London to call on that government for\r\nthe satisfaction and security required by the outrage. A very\r\nshort interval ought now to bring the answer, which shall be\r\ncommunicated to you as soon as received; then also, or as soon\r\nafter as the public interests shall be found to admit, the unratified\r\ntreaty, and the proceedings relative to it, shall be made\r\nknown to you.\r\n\r\nThe aggression thus begun has been continued on the part\r\nof the British commanders, by remaining within our waters, in\r\ndefiance of the authority of the country, by habitual violations\r\nof its jurisdiction, and at length by putting to death one of the\r\npersons whom they had forcibly taken from on board the Chesapeake.\r\nThese aggravations necessarily lead to the policy, either\r\nof never admitting an armed vessel into our harbors, or of maintaining\r\nin every harbor such an armed force as may constrain\r\nobedience to the laws, and protect the lives and property of our\r\ncitizens, against their armed guests. But the expense of such a\r\nstanding force, and its inconsistence with our principles, dispense\r\nwith those courtesies which would necessarily call for it, and\r\nleave us equally free to exclude the navy, as we are the army\r\nof a foreign power, from entering our limits.\r\n\r\nTo former violations of maritime rights, another is now added\r\nof very extensive effect. The government of that nation has\r\nissued an order interdicting all trade by neutrals between ports\r\nnot in amity with them; and being now at war with nearly\r\nevery nation on the Atlantic and Mediterranean seas, our vessels\r\nare required to sacrifice their cargoes at the first port they touch,\r\nor to return home without the benefit of going to any other market.\r\nUnder this new law of the ocean, our trade on the Mediterranean\r\nhas been swept away by seizures and condemnations,\r\nand that in other seas is threatened with the same fate.\r\n\r\nOur differences with Spain remain still unsettled; no measure\r\nhaving been taken on her part, since my last communication to\r\nCongress, to bring them to a close. But under a state of things\r\nwhich may favor a reconsideration, they have been recently\r\npressed, and an expectation is entertained that they may now\r\nsoon be brought to an issue of some sort. With their subjects\r\non our borders, no new collisions have taken place nor seem\r\nimmediately to be apprehended. To our former grounds of complaint\r\nhas been added a very serious one, as you will see by the\r\ndecree, a copy of which is now communicated. Whether this\r\ndecree, which professes to be conformable to that of the French\r\ngovernment of November 21st, 1806, heretofore communicated\r\nto Congress, will also be conformed to that in its construction\r\nand application in relation to the United States, had not been\r\nascertained at the date of our last communications. These,\r\nhowever, gave reason to expect such a conformity.\r\n\r\nWith the other nations of Europe our harmony has been uninterrupted,\r\nand commerce and friendly intercourse have been\r\nmaintained on their usual footing.\r\n\r\nOur peace with the several States on the coast of Barbary appears\r\nas firm as at any former period, and is as likely to continue\r\nas that of any other nation.\r\n\r\nAmong our Indian neighbors in the north-western quarter,\r\nsome fermentation was observed soon after the late occurrences,\r\nthreatening the continuance of our peace. Messages were said\r\nto be interchanged, and tokens to be passing, which usually denote\r\na state of restlessness among them, and the character of the\r\nagitators pointed to the sources of excitement. Measures were\r\nimmediately taken for providing against that danger; instructions\r\nwere given to require explanations, and with assurances of our\r\ncontinued friendship, to admonish the tribes to remain quiet at\r\nhome, taking no part in quarrels not belonging to them. As far\r\nas we are yet informed, the tribes in our vicinity, who are most\r\nadvanced in the pursuits of industry, are sincerely disposed to\r\nadhere to their friendship with us, and to their peace with all\r\nothers; while those more remote do not present appearances sufficiently\r\nquiet to justify the intermission of military precaution\r\non our part.\r\n\r\nThe great tribes on our south-western quarter, much advanced\r\nbeyond the others in agriculture and household arts, appear tranquil,\r\nand identifying their views with ours, in proportion to their\r\nadvancement. With the whole of these people, in every quarter,\r\nI shall continue to inculcate peace and friendship with all their\r\nneighbors, and perseverance in those occupations and pursuits\r\nwhich will best promote their own well-being.\r\n\r\nThe appropriations of the last session, for the defence of our\r\nseaport towns and harbors, were made under expectation that a\r\ncontinuance of our peace would permit us to proceed in that\r\nwork according to our convenience. It has been thought better\r\nto apply the sums then given, toward the defence of New York,\r\nCharleston, and New Orleans chiefly, as most open and most\r\nlikely first to need protection; and to leave places less immediately\r\nin danger to the provisions of the present session.\r\n\r\nThe gun-boats, too, already provided, have on a like principle\r\nbeen chiefly assigned to New York, New Orleans, and the Chesapeake.\r\nWhether our movable force on the water, so material\r\nin aid of the defensive works on the land, should be augmented\r\nin this or any other form, is left to the wisdom of the legislature.\r\nFor the purpose of manning these vessels in sudden attacks on\r\nour harbors, it is a matter for consideration, whether the seamen\r\nof the United States may not justly be formed into a special\r\nmilitia, to be called on for tours of duty in defence of the harbors\r\nwhere they shall happen to be; the ordinary militia of the place\r\nfurnishing that portion which may consist of landsmen.\r\n\r\nThe moment our peace was threatened, I deemed it indispensable\r\nto secure a greater provision of those articles of military\r\nstores with which our magazines were not sufficiently furnished.\r\nTo have awaited a previous and special sanction by law would\r\nhave lost occasions which might not be retrieved. I did not\r\nhesitate, therefore, to authorize engagements for such supplements\r\nto our existing stock as would render it adequate to the emergencies\r\nthreatening us; and I trust that the legislature, feeling\r\nthe same anxiety for the safety of our country, so materially advanced\r\nby this precaution, will approve, when done, what they\r\nwould have seen so important to be done if then assembled.\r\nExpenses, also unprovided for, arose out of the necessity of calling\r\nall our gun-boats into actual service for the defence of our\r\nharbors; of all which accounts will be laid before you.\r\n\r\nWhether a regular army is to be raised, and to what extent,\r\nmust depend on the information so shortly expected. In the\r\nmeantime, I have called on the States for quotas of militia, to\r\nbe in readiness for present defence; and have, moreover, encouraged\r\nthe acceptance of volunteers; and I am happy to inform\r\nyou that these have offered themselves with great alacrity in\r\nevery part of the Union. They are ordered to be organized, and\r\nready at a moment's warning to proceed on any service to which\r\nthey may be called, and every preparation within the executive\r\npowers has been made to insure us the benefit of early exertions.\r\n\r\nI informed Congress at their last session of the enterprises\r\nagainst the public peace, which were believed to be in preparation\r\nby Aaron Burr and his associates, of the measures taken to\r\ndefeat them, and to bring the offenders to justice. Their enterprises\r\nwere happily defeated by the patriotic exertions of the\r\nmilitia wherever called into action, by the fidelity of the army,\r\nand energy of the commander-in-chief in promptly arranging\r\nthe difficulties presenting themselves on the Sabine, repairing to\r\nmeet those arising on the Mississippi, and dissipating, before their\r\nexplosion, plots engendering there. I shall think it my duty to\r\nlay before you the proceedings and the evidence publicly exhibited\r\non the arraignment of the principal offenders before the\r\ncircuit court of Virginia. You will be enabled to judge whether\r\nthe defeat was in the testimony, in the law, or in the administration\r\nof the law; and wherever it shall be found, the legislature\r\nalone can apply or originate the remedy. The framers of\r\nour constitution certainly supposed they had guarded, as well\r\ntheir government against destruction by treason, as their citizens\r\nagainst oppression, under pretence of it; and if these ends are\r\nnot attained, it is of importance to inquire by what means, more\r\neffectual, they may be secured.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the receipts of revenue, during the year ending\r\non the thirtieth day of September last, being not yet made\r\nup, a correct statement will be hereafter transmitted from the\r\ntreasury. In the meantime, it is ascertained that the receipts\r\nhave amounted to near sixteen millions of dollars, which, with\r\nthe five millions and a half in the treasury at the beginning of\r\nthe year, have enabled us, after meeting the current demands\r\nand interest incurred, to pay more than four millions of the\r\nprincipal of our funded debt. These payments, with those of\r\nthe preceding five and a half years, have extinguished of the\r\nfunded debt twenty-five millions and a half of dollars, being the\r\nwhole which could be paid or purchased within the limits of\r\nthe law and of our contracts, and have left us in the treasury\r\neight millions and a half of dollars. A portion of this sum may\r\nbe considered as a commencement of accumulation of the surpluses\r\nof revenue, which, after paying the instalments of debts\r\nas they shall become payable, will remain without any specific\r\nobject. It may partly, indeed, be applied toward completing the\r\ndefence of the exposed points of our country, on such a scale as\r\nshall be adapted to our principles and circumstances. This object\r\nis doubtless among the first entitled to attention, in such a\r\nstate of our finances, and it is one which, whether we have\r\npeace or war, will provide security where it is due. Whether\r\nwhat shall remain of this, with the future surpluses, may be\r\nusefully applied to purposes already authorized, or more usefully\r\nto others requiring new authorities, or how otherwise they shall\r\nbe disposed of, are questions calling for the notice of Congress,\r\nunless indeed they shall be superseded by a change in our public\r\nrelations now awaiting the determination of others. Whatever\r\nbe that determination, it is a great consolation that it will become\r\nknown at a moment when the supreme council of the nation is\r\nassembled at its post, and ready to give the aids of its wisdom\r\nand authority to whatever course the good of our country shall\r\nthen call us to pursue.\r\n\r\nMatters of minor importance will be the subjects of future\r\ncommunications; and nothing shall be wanting on my part\r\nwhich may give information or despatch to the proceedings of\r\nthe legislature in the exercise of their high duties, and at a moment\r\nso interesting to the public welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--NOVEMBER 23, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the assurance in my message at the opening of\r\nthe present session of Congress, I now lay before you a copy of\r\nthe proceedings, and of the evidence exhibited on the arraignment\r\nof Aaron Burr, and others, before the circuit court of the\r\nUnited States, held in Virginia, in the course of the present year,\r\nin as authentic form as their several parts have admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--DECEMBER 18, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nThe communications now made, showing the great and increasing\r\ndangers with which our vessels, our seamen, and merchandise,\r\nare threatened on the high seas and elsewhere, from\r\nthe belligerent powers of Europe, and it being of great importance\r\nto keep in safety these essential resources, I deem it my\r\nduty to recommend the subject to the consideration of Congress,\r\nwho will doubtless perceive all the advantages which may be\r\nexpected from an inhibition of the departure of our vessels from\r\nthe ports of the United States.\r\n\r\nTheir wisdom will also see the necessity of making every\r\npreparation for whatever events may grow out of the present\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--JANUARY 20, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:--\r\n\r\nSome days previous to your resolution of the 13th instant, a\r\ncourt of inquiry had been instituted at the request of General\r\nWilkinson, charged to make the inquiry into his conduct which\r\nthe first resolution desires, and had commenced their proceedings.\r\nTo the judge-advocate of that court the papers and information\r\non that subject, transmitted to me by the House of Representatives,\r\nhave been delivered, to be used according to the rules and\r\npowers of that court.\r\n\r\nThe request of a communication of any information, which\r\nmay have been received at any time since the establishment of\r\nthe present government, touching combinations with foreign nations\r\nfor dismembering the Union, or the corrupt receipt of\r\nmoney by any officer of the United States from the agents of\r\nforeign governments, can be complied with but in a partial degree.\r\n\r\nIt is well understood that, in the first or second year of the\r\npresidency of General Washington, information was given to him\r\nrelating to certain combinations with the agents of a foreign government\r\nfor the dismemberment of the Union; which combinations\r\nhad taken place before the establishment of the present\r\nfederal government. This information, however, is believed\r\nnever to have been deposited in any public office, or left in that\r\nof the president's secretary, these having been duly examined,\r\nbut to have been considered as personally confidential, and, therefore,\r\nretained among his private papers. A communication from\r\nthe governor of Virginia to General Washington, is found in the\r\noffice of the president's secretary, which, although not strictly\r\nwithin the terms of the request of the House of Representatives,\r\nis communicated, inasmuch as it may throw some light on the\r\nsubjects of the correspondence of that time, between certain foreign\r\nagents and citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the first or second year of the administration of President\r\nAdams, Andrew Ellicott, then employed in designating, in conjunction\r\nwith the Spanish authorities, the boundaries between\r\nthe territories of the United States and Spain, under the treaty\r\nwith that nation, communicated to the executive of the United\r\nStates papers and information respecting the subjects of the present\r\ninquiry, which were deposited in the office of State. Copies\r\nof these are now transmitted to the House of Representatives,\r\nexcept of a single letter and a reference from the said Andrew\r\nEllicott, which being expressly desired to be kept secret, is therefore\r\nnot communicated, but its contents can be obtained from\r\nhimself in a more legal form, and directions have been given to\r\nsummon him to appear as a witness before the court of inquiry.\r\n\r\nA paper \"on the commerce of Louisiana,\" bearing date of the\r\n18th of April, 1798, is found in the office of State, supposed to\r\nhave been communicated by Mr. Daniel Clark, of New Orleans,\r\nthen a subject of Spain, and now of the House of Representatives\r\nof the United States, stating certain commercial transactions\r\nof General Wilkinson, in New Orleans; an extract from this is\r\nnow communicated, because it contains facts which may have\r\nsome bearing on the questions relating to him.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the war-office, by fire, in the close of 1800,\r\ninvolved all information it contained at that date.\r\n\r\nThe papers already described, therefore, constitute the whole\r\ninformation on the subjects, deposited in the public offices, during\r\nthe preceding administrations, as far as has yet been found; but\r\nit cannot be affirmed that there may be no others, because, the\r\npapers of the office being filed, for the most part, alphabetically,\r\nunless aided by the suggestion of any particular name which may\r\nhave given such information, nothing short of a careful examination\r\nof the papers in the offices generally, could authorize such\r\naffirmation.\r\n\r\nAbout a twelvemonth after I came to the administration of the\r\ngovernment, Mr. Clark gave some verbal information to myself,\r\nas well as to the Secretary of State, relating to the same combinations\r\nfor the dismemberment of the Union. He was listened\r\nto freely, and he then delivered the letter of Governor Gagoso,\r\naddressed to himself, of which a copy is now communicated.\r\nAfter his return to New Orleans, he forwarded to the Secretary\r\nof State other papers, with a request that, after perusal, they\r\nshould be burned. This, however, was not done, and he was\r\nso informed by the Secretary of State, and that they would be\r\nheld subject to his order. These papers have not yet been found\r\nin the office. A letter, therefore, has been addressed to the former\r\nchief clerk, who may, perhaps, give information respecting them.\r\nAs far as our memories enables us to say, they related only to\r\nthe combinations before spoken of, and not at all to the corrupt\r\nreceipt of money by any officer of the United States; consequently,\r\nthey respected what was considered as a dead matter, known\r\nto the preceding administrations, and offering nothing new to\r\ncall for investigations, which those nearest the dates of the transactions\r\nhad not thought proper to institute.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the communications made to me on the subject\r\nof the conspiracy of Aaron Burr, I sometimes received letters,\r\nsome of them anonymous, some under names true or false, expressing\r\nsuspicions and insinuations against General Wilkinson.\r\nBut one only of them, and that anonymous, specified any particular\r\nfact, and that fact was one of those which had already been\r\ncommunicated to a former administration.\r\n\r\nNo other information within the purview of the request of the\r\nhouse is known to have been received by any department of the\r\ngovernment from the establishment of the present federal government.\r\nThat which has recently been communicated to the\r\nHouse of Representatives, and by them to me, is the first direct\r\ntestimony ever made known to me, charging General Wilkinson\r\nwith the corrupt receipt of money; and the House of Representatives\r\nmay be assured that the duties which this information devolves\r\non me shall be exercised with rigorous impartiality.\r\nShould any want of power in the court to compel the rendering\r\nof testimony, obstruct that full and impartial inquiry, which\r\nalone can establish guilt or innocence, and satisfy justice, the\r\nlegislative authority only will be competent to the remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--JANUARY 30, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nThe Choctaws being indebted to their merchants beyond what\r\ncould be discharged by the ordinary proceeds of their huntings,\r\nand pressed for payment, proposed to the United States to cede\r\nlands to the amount of their debts, and designated them in two\r\ndifferent portions of their country. These designations not at all\r\nsuiting us, were declined. Still, urged by their creditors, as well\r\nas their own desire to be liberated from debt, they at length proposed\r\nto make a cession which should be to our convenience.\r\nBy a treaty signed at Pooshapakonuk, on the 16th November,\r\n1805, they accordingly ceded all their lands south of a line to be\r\nrun from their and our boundary at the Omochita, eastwardly to\r\ntheir boundary with the Creeks on the ridge between the Tombigbee\r\nand Alabama, as is more particularly described in the\r\ntreaty, containing about five millions of acres, as is supposed,\r\nand uniting our possessions there from Adams to Washington\r\ncounty.\r\n\r\nThe location contemplated in the instructions to the commissioners\r\nwas on the Mississippi. That in the treaty being entirely\r\ndifferent, I was, at that time, disinclined to its ratification, and\r\nhave suffered it to be unacted on. But progressive difficulties in\r\nour foreign relations have brought into view considerations others\r\nthan those which then prevailed. It is perhaps now as interesting\r\nto obtain footing for a strong settlement of militia along our\r\nsouthern frontier, eastward of the Mississippi, as on the west of\r\nthat river, and more so than higher up the river itself. The consolidation\r\nof the Mississippi territory, and the establishment of a\r\nbarrier of separation between the Indians and our southern neighbors,\r\nare also important objects; and the Choctaws and their\r\ncreditors being still anxious that the sale should be made, I submitted\r\nthe treaty to the Senate, who have advised and consented\r\nto its ratification. I, therefore, now lay it before both houses\r\nof Congress for the exercise of their constitutional powers as to\r\nthe means of fulfilling it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--JANUARY 30, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nThe posts of Detroit and Mackinac, having been originally\r\nintended by the governments which established and held them,\r\nas mere depôts for the commerce with the Indians, very small\r\ncessions of land around were obtained or asked from the native\r\nproprietors, and these posts depended for protection on the\r\nstrength of their garrisons. The principle of our government\r\nleading us to the employment of such moderate garrisons in time\r\nof peace, as may merely take care of the post, and to a reliance\r\non the neighboring militia for its support in the first moments\r\nof war, I have thought it would be important to obtain from the\r\nIndians such a cession of the neighborhood of these posts as\r\nmight maintain a militia proportioned to this object; and I have\r\nparticularly contemplated, with this view, the acquisition of the\r\neastern moiety of the peninsula between the lakes Huron,\r\nMichigan, and Erie, extending it to the Connecticut reserve, so\r\nsoon as it could be effected with the perfect good will of the natives.\r\n\r\nBy a treaty concluded at Detroit, on the 17th of November\r\nlast, with the Ottawas, Chippewas, Wyandots, and Pottawatomies,\r\nso much of this country has been obtained as extends from\r\nabout Saguina bay southwardly to the Miami of the lakes, supposed\r\nto contain upward of five millions of acres, with a prospect\r\nof obtaining, for the present, a breadth of two miles for a\r\ncommunication from the Miami to the Connecticut reserve.\r\n\r\nThe Senate having advised and consented to the ratification\r\nof this treaty, I now lay it before both houses of Congress for\r\nthe exercise of their constitutional powers as to the means of\r\nfulfilling it.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--FEBRUARY 2, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nHaving received an official communication of certain orders\r\nof the British government against the maritime rights of neutrals,\r\nbearing date of the 11th of November, 1807, I transmitted to\r\nCongress, as a further proof of the increasing dangers to our navigation\r\nand commerce which led to the provident measures of\r\nthe present session, laying an embargo on our own vessels.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--FEBRUARY 4, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the House of Representatives of the United States_:--\r\n\r\nIn my message, January 20th, I stated that some papers forwarded\r\nby Mr. Daniel Clark, of New Orleans, to the Secretary\r\nof State, in 1803, had not then been found in the office of State;\r\nand that a letter had been addressed to the former chief clerk, in\r\nthe hope that he might advise where they should be sought for.\r\nBy indications received from him they are now found. Among\r\nthem are two letters from the Baron de Carondelet to an officer\r\nserving under him at a separate post, in which his views of a dismemberment\r\nof our Union are expressed. Extracts of so much\r\nof these letters as are within the scope of the resolutions of the\r\nhouse, are now communicated. With these were found the letters\r\nfrom Mr. Clark, to the Secretary of State, in 1803. A part\r\nof one only of these relates to this subject, and is extracted and\r\nenclosed for the information of the house. In no part of the\r\npapers communicated by Mr. Clark, which are voluminous, and\r\nin different languages, nor in his letters, have we found any intimation\r\nof the corrupt receipt of money by any officer of the\r\nUnited States from any foreign nation. As to the combinations\r\nwith foreign agents for the dismemberment of the Union, these\r\npapers and letters offer nothing which was not probably known\r\nto my predecessors, or which could call anew for inquiries, which\r\nthey had not thought necessary to institute, when the facts were\r\nrecent and could be better proved. They probably believed it\r\nbest to let pass into oblivion transactions, which, however culpable,\r\nhad commenced before this government existed, and had\r\nbeen finally extinguished by the treaty of 1795.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--FEBRUARY 9, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nI communicate to Congress, for their information, a letter from\r\nthe person acting in the absence of our consul at Naples, giving\r\nreason to believe, on the affidavit of a Captain Sheffield of the\r\nAmerican schooner Mary Ann, that the dey of Algiers had commenced\r\nwar against the United States. For this no just cause\r\nhas been given on our part within my knowledge. We may\r\ndaily expect more authentic and particular information on the\r\nsubject from Mr. Lear, who was residing as our consul at Algiers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--FEBRUARY 15, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nI communicate for the information of Congress a letter from the\r\nconsul of the United States at Malaga, to the Secretary of State,\r\ncovering one from Mr. Lear, our consul at Algiers, which gives\r\ninformation, that the rupture threatened on the part of the dey\r\nof Algiers has been amicably settled, and the vessels seized by\r\nhim are liberated.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--FEBRUARY 19, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nThe States of Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, having,\r\nby their several acts, consented that the road from Cumberland\r\nto the State of Ohio, authorized by the act of Congress of the\r\n29th March, 1806, should pass through those States, and the report\r\nof the commissioners communicated to Congress with my\r\nmessage of the 31st January, 1807, having been duly considered,\r\nI have approved of the route therein proposed for the said road,\r\nas far as Brownsville, with a single deviation since located, which\r\ncarries it through Uniontown.\r\n\r\nFrom thence the course of the Ohio, and the point within the\r\nlegal limits at which it shall strike that river, is still to be decided.\r\nIn forming this decision, I shall pay material regard to\r\nthe interests and wishes of the populous part of the State of\r\nOhio, and to a future and convenient connection with the road\r\nwhich is to lead from the Indian boundary near Cincinnati, by\r\nVincennes to the Mississippi, at St. Louis, under authority of the\r\nact, 21st April, 1806. In this way we may accomplish a continued\r\nand advantageous line of communication from the seat\r\nof the general government to St. Louis, passing through several\r\nvery interesting points of the western country.\r\n\r\nI have thought it advisable also to secure from obliteration the\r\ntrace of the road so far as it has been approved, which has been\r\nexecuted at such considerable expense, by opening one half of\r\nits breadth through its whole length.\r\n\r\nThe report of the commissioners, herewith transmitted, will\r\ngive particular information of their proceedings, under the act of\r\nthe 29th March, 1806, since the date of my message of the 31st\r\nJanuary, 1807, and will enable Congress to adopt further measures\r\nrelative thereto, as they may deem proper under existing circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--FEBRUARY 25, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nThe dangers of our country, arising from the contests of other\r\nnations and the urgency of making preparation for whatever\r\nevents might affect our relations with them, have been intimated\r\nin preceding messages to Congress. To secure ourselves by due\r\nprecautions, an augmentation of our military force, as well regular\r\nas of volunteer militia, seems to be expedient. The precise\r\nextent of that augmentation cannot as yet be satisfactorily suggested,\r\nbut that no time may be lost, and especially at a season\r\ndeemed favorable to the object, I submit to the wisdom of the\r\nlegislature whether they will authorize a commencement of this\r\nprecautionary work by a present provision for raising and organizing\r\nsome additional force; reserving to themselves to decide\r\nits ultimate extent on such views of our situation as I may\r\nbe enabled to present at a future day of the session.\r\n\r\nIf an increase of force be now approved, I submit to their consideration\r\nthe outlines of a plan proposed in the enclosed letter\r\nfrom the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\nI recommend, also, to the attention of Congress, the term at\r\nwhich the act of April 18th, 1806, concerning the militia, will\r\nexpire, and the effect of that expiration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--MARCH 7, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nIn the city of New Orleans, and adjacent to it, are sundry\r\nparcels of ground, some of them with buildings and other improvements\r\non them, which it is my duty to present to the attention\r\nof the legislature. The title to those grounds appear to\r\nhave been retained in the former sovereigns of the province of\r\nLouisiana, as public fiduciaries, and for the purposes of the province.\r\nSome of them were used for the residence of the governor,\r\nfor public offices, hospitals, barracks, magazines, fortifications,\r\nlevees, &c., others for the townhouse, schools, markets,\r\nlandings, and other purposes of the city of New Orleans; some\r\nwere held by religious corporations or persons; others seem to\r\nhave been reserved for future disposition. To these must be\r\nadded a parcel called the Batture, which requires more particular\r\ndescription. It is understood to have been a shoal or elevation\r\nof the bottom of the river, adjacent to the bank of the suburbs\r\nof St. Mary, produced by the successive depositions of mud during\r\nthe annual inundations of the river, and covered with water\r\nonly during those inundations. At all other seasons it has been\r\nused by the city, immemorially to furnish earth for raising their\r\nstreets and courtyards, for mortar, and other necessary purposes,\r\nand as a landing or quay for unlading firewood, lumber, and other\r\narticles brought by water. This having been lately claimed\r\nby a private individual, the city opposed the claim on a supposed\r\nlegal title in itself; but it has been adjudged that the legal title\r\nwas not in the city. It is, however, alleged that that title, originally\r\nin the former sovereigns, was never parted with by them,\r\nbut was retained in them for the uses of the city and province,\r\nand consequently has now passed over to the United States.\r\nUntil this question can be decided under legislative authority,\r\nmeasures have been taken, according to law, to prevent any\r\nchange in the state of things, and to keep the grounds clear of\r\nintruders. The settlement of this title, the appropriations of\r\nthe grounds and improvements formerly occupied for provincial\r\npurposes to the same or such other objects as may be better suited\r\nto present circumstances; the confirmation of the uses in other\r\nparcels to such bodies, corporate or private, as may of right, or\r\nother reasonable considerations, expect them, are matters now\r\nsubmitted to the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe papers and plans now transmitted, will give them such\r\ninformation on the subject as I possess, and being mostly originals,\r\nI must request that they may be communicated from the one\r\nto the other house to answer the purposes of both.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--MARCH 17, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nI have heretofore communicated to Congress the decrees of the\r\ngovernment of France, of November 21st, 1806, and of Spain,\r\nFebruary 19th, 1807, with the orders of the British government,\r\nof January and November, 1807.\r\n\r\nI now transmit a decree of the Emperor of France, of December\r\n17th, 1807, and a similar decree of the 3d January last, by\r\nhis Catholic Majesty. Although the decree of France has not\r\nbeen received by official communication, yet the different channels\r\nof promulgation through which the public are possessed of\r\nit, with the formal testimony furnished by the government of\r\nSpain, in their decree, leave us without a doubt that such a one\r\nhas been issued. These decrees and orders, taken together, want\r\nlittle of amounting to a declaration that every neutral vessel found\r\non the high seas, whatsoever be her cargo, and whatsoever foreign\r\nport be that of her departure or destination, shall be deemed\r\nlawful prize; and they prove, more and more, the expediency of\r\nretaining our vessels, our seamen, and property, within our own\r\nharbors, until the dangers to which they are exposed can be removed\r\nor lessened.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--MARCH 18, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:\r\n\r\nThe scale on which the military academy at West Point was\r\noriginally established, is become too limited to furnish the number\r\nof well-instructed subjects in the different branches of artillery\r\nand engineering which the public service calls for. The want\r\nof such characters is already sensibly felt, and will be increased\r\nwith the enlargement of our plans of military preparation. The\r\nchief engineer having been instructed to consider the subject,\r\nand to propose an augmentation which might render the establishment\r\ncommensurate with the present circumstances of our\r\ncountry, has made the report I now transmit for the consideration\r\nof Congress.\r\n\r\nThe idea suggested by him of removing the institution to this\r\nplace, is also worthy of attention. Beside the advantage of\r\nplacing it under the immediate eye of the government, it may\r\nrender its benefits common to the naval department, and will\r\nfurnish opportunities of selecting on better information, the characters\r\nmost qualified to fulfil the duties which the public service\r\nmay call for.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--MARCH 22, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the present session I informed the legislature\r\nthat the measures which had been taken with the government\r\nof Great Britain for the settlement of our neutral and national\r\nrights, and of the conditions of commercial intercourse\r\nwith that nation, had resulted in articles of a treaty which could\r\nnot be acceded to on our part; that instructions had consequently\r\nbeen sent to our ministers there to resume the negotiations,\r\nand to endeavor to obtain certain alterations; and that this was\r\ninterrupted by the transaction which took place between the\r\nfrigates Leopard and Chesapeake. The call on that government\r\nfor reparation of this wrong produced, as Congress have already\r\nbeen informed, the mission of a special minister to this country,\r\nand the occasion is now arrived when the public interest permits\r\nand requires that the whole of these proceedings should be made\r\nknown to you.\r\n\r\nI therefore now communicate the instructions given to our\r\nminister resident at London, and his communications to that government\r\non the subject of the Chesapeake, with the correspondence\r\nwhich has taken place here between the Secretary of State\r\nand Mr. Rose, the special minister charged with the adjustment\r\nof that difference; the instructions to our ministers for the formation\r\nof a treaty; their correspondence with the British commissioners\r\nand with their own government on that subject; the\r\ntreaty itself, and written declaration of the British commissioners\r\naccompanying it, and the instructions given by us for resuming\r\nthe negotiations, with the proceedings and correspondence subsequent\r\nthereto. To these I have added a letter lately addressed\r\nto the Secretary of State from one of our late ministers, which,\r\nthough not strictly written in an official character, I think it my\r\nduty to communicate, in order that his views of the proposed\r\ntreaty and its several articles may be fairly presented and understood.\r\n\r\nAlthough I have heretofore and from time to time made such\r\ncommunications to Congress as to keep them possessed of a general\r\nand just view of the proceedings and dispositions of the government\r\nof France toward this country, yet, in our present critical\r\nsituation, when we find no conduct on our part, however impartial\r\nand friendly, has been sufficient to insure from either belligerent\r\na just respect for our rights, I am desirous that nothing\r\nshall be omitted on my part which may add to your information\r\non this subject, or contribute to the correctness of the views\r\nwhich should be formed. The papers which for these reasons\r\nI now lay before you embrace all the communications, official or\r\nverbal, from the French government, respecting the general relations\r\nbetween the two countries which have been transmitted\r\nthrough our minister there, or through any other accredited\r\nchannel, since the last session of Congress, to which time all information\r\nof the same kind had from time to time been given\r\nthem. Some of these papers have already been submitted to\r\nCongress; but it is thought better to offer them again, in order\r\nthat the chain of communications, of which they make a part,\r\nmay be presented unbroken.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the 26th of February, I communicated to both\r\nhouses the letter of General Armstrong to M. Champagny, I desired\r\nit might not be published, because of the tendency of that\r\npractice to restrain injuriously the freedom of our foreign correspondence.\r\nBut perceiving that this caution, proceeding purely\r\nfrom a regard for the public good, has furnished occasion for\r\ndisseminating unfounded suspicions and insinuations, I am induced\r\nto believe that the good which will now result from its\r\npublication, by confirming the confidence and union of our fellow\r\ncitizens, will more than countervail the ordinary objection to\r\nsuch publications. It is my wish, therefore, that it may be now\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n\r\nEIGHTH ANNUAL MESSAGE.--NOVEMBER 8, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nIt would have been a source, fellow citizens, of much gratification,\r\nif our last communications from Europe had enabled me\r\nto inform you that the belligerent nations, whose disregard of\r\nneutral rights has been so destructive to our commerce, had become\r\nawakened to the duty and true policy of revoking their\r\nunrighteous edicts. That no means might be omitted to produce\r\nthis salutary effect, I lost no time in availing myself of the act\r\nauthorizing a suspension, in whole or in part, of the several embargo\r\nlaws. Our ministers at London and Paris were instructed\r\nto explain to the respective governments there, our disposition to\r\nexercise the authority in such manner as would withdraw the\r\npretext on which the aggressions were originally founded, and\r\nopen the way for a renewal of that commercial intercourse which\r\nit was alleged on all sides had been reluctantly obstructed. As\r\neach of those governments had pledged its readiness to concur\r\nin renouncing a measure which reached its adversary through\r\nthe incontestable rights of neutrals only, and as the measure had\r\nbeen assumed by each as a retaliation for an asserted acquiescence\r\nin the aggressions of the other, it was reasonably expected that\r\nthe occasion would have been seized by both for evincing the\r\nsincerity of their profession, and for restoring to the commerce\r\nof the United States its legitimate freedom. The instructions to\r\nour ministers with respect to the different belligerents were necessarily\r\nmodified with reference to their different circumstances,\r\nand to the condition annexed by law to the executive power of\r\nsuspension, requiring a degree of security to our commerce which\r\nwould not result from a repeal of the decrees of France. Instead\r\nof a pledge, therefore, of a suspension of the embargo as to her\r\nin case of such a repeal, it was presumed that a sufficient inducement\r\nmight be found in other considerations, and particularly in\r\nthe change produced by a compliance with our just demands by\r\none belligerent, and a refusal by the other, in the relations between\r\nthe other and the United States. To Great Britain, whose\r\npower on the ocean is so ascendant, it was deemed not inconsistent\r\nwith that condition to state explicitly, that on her rescinding\r\nher orders in relation to the United States their trade would\r\nbe opened with her, and remain shut to her enemy, in case of\r\nhis failure to rescind his decrees also. From France no answer\r\nhas been received, nor any indication that the requisite change\r\nin her decrees is contemplated. The favorable reception of the\r\nproposition to Great Britain was the less to be doubted, as her\r\norders of council had not only been referred for their vindication\r\nto an acquiescence on the part of the United States no longer to\r\nbe pretended, but as the arrangement proposed, while it resisted\r\nthe illegal decrees of France, involved, moreover, substantially,\r\nthe precise advantages professedly aimed at by the British orders.\r\nThe arrangement has nevertheless been rejected.\r\n\r\nThis candid and liberal experiment having thus failed, and no\r\nother event having occurred on which a suspension of the embargo\r\nby the executive was authorized, it necessarily remains in\r\nthe extent originally given to it. We have the satisfaction,\r\nhowever, to reflect, that in return for the privations by the measure,\r\nand which our fellow citizens in general have borne with\r\npatriotism, it has had the important effects of saving our mariners\r\nand our vast mercantile property, as well as of affording\r\ntime for prosecuting the defensive and provisional measures called\r\nfor by the occasion. It has demonstrated to foreign nations the\r\nmoderation and firmness which govern our councils, and to our\r\ncitizens the necessity of uniting in support of the laws and the\r\nrights of their country, and has thus long frustrated those usurpations\r\nand spoliations which, if resisted, involve war; if submitted\r\nto, sacrificed a vital principle of our national independence.\r\n\r\nUnder a continuance of the belligerent measures which, in defiance\r\nof laws which consecrate the rights of neutrals, overspread\r\nthe ocean with danger, it will rest with the wisdom of Congress\r\nto decide on the course best adapted to such a state of things;\r\nand bringing with them, as they do, from every part of the\r\nUnion, the sentiments of our constituents, my confidence is\r\nstrengthened, that in forming this decision they will, with an\r\nunerring regard to the essential rights and interests of the nation,\r\nweigh and compare the painful alternatives out of which a choice\r\nis to be made. Nor should I do justice to the virtues which on\r\nother occasions have marked the character of our fellow citizens,\r\nif I did not cherish an equal confidence that the alternative\r\nchosen, whatever it may be, will be maintained with all the fortitude\r\nand patriotism which the crisis ought to inspire.\r\n\r\nThe documents containing the correspondences on the subject\r\nof the foreign edicts against our commerce, with the instructions\r\ngiven to our ministers at London and Paris, are now laid before you.\r\n\r\nThe communications made to Congress at their last session\r\nexplained the posture in which the close of the discussion relating\r\nto the attack by a British ship of war on the frigate Chesapeake\r\nleft a subject on which the nation had manifested so honorable\r\na sensibility. Every view of what had passed authorized a\r\nbelief that immediate steps would be taken by the British government\r\nfor redressing a wrong, which, the more it was investigated,\r\nappeared the more clearly to require what had not been\r\nprovided for in the special mission. It is found that no steps\r\nhave been taken for the purpose. On the contrary, it will be\r\nseen, in the documents laid before you, that the inadmissible\r\npreliminary which obstructed the adjustment is still adhered to;\r\nand, moreover, that it is now brought into connection with the\r\ndistinct and irrelative case of the orders in council. The instructions\r\nwhich had been given to our ministers at London\r\nwith a view to facilitate, if necessary, the reparation claimed by\r\nthe United States, are included in the documents communicated.\r\n\r\nOur relations with the other powers of Europe have undergone\r\nno material changes since your last session. The important\r\nnegotiations with Spain, which had been alternately suspended\r\nand resumed, necessarily experience a pause under the\r\nextraordinary and interesting crisis which distinguished her internal\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nWith the Barbary powers we continue in harmony, with the\r\nexception of an unjustifiable proceeding of the dey of Algiers\r\ntoward our consul to that regency. Its character and circumstances\r\nare now laid before you, and will enable you to decide\r\nhow far it may, either now or hereafter, call for any measures\r\nnot within the limits of the executive authority.\r\n\r\nWith our Indian neighbors the public peace has been steadily\r\nmaintained. Some instances of individual wrong have, as at\r\nother times, taken place, but in nowise implicating the will of\r\nthe nation. Beyond the Mississippi, the Iowas, the Sacs, and\r\nthe Alabamas, have delivered up for trial and punishment individuals\r\nfrom among themselves accused of murdering citizens of\r\nthe United States. On this side of the Mississippi, the Creeks\r\nare exerting themselves to arrest offenders of the same kind; and\r\nthe Choctaws have manifested their readiness and desire for\r\namicable and just arrangements respecting depredations committed\r\nby disorderly persons of their tribe. And, generally,\r\nfrom a conviction that we consider them as part of ourselves,\r\nand cherish with sincerity their rights and interests, the attachment\r\nof the Indian tribes is gaining strength daily--is extending\r\nfrom the nearer to the more remote, and will amply requite us\r\nfor the justice and friendship practised towards them. Husbandry\r\nand household manufacture are advancing among them,\r\nmore rapidly with the southern than the northern tribes, from\r\ncircumstances of soil and climate; and one of the two great\r\ndivisions of the Cherokee nation have now under consideration\r\nto solicit the citizenship of the United States, and to be identified\r\nwith us in laws and government, in such progressive manner\r\nas we shall think best.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the appropriations of the last session of\r\nCongress for the security of our seaport towns and harbors, such\r\nworks of defence have been erected as seemed to be called for by\r\nthe situation of the several places, their relative importance, and\r\nthe scale of expense indicated by the amount of the appropriation.\r\nThese works will chiefly be finished in the course of the present\r\nseason, except at New York and New Orleans, where most was to\r\nbe done; and although a great proportion of the last appropriation\r\nhas been expended on the former place, yet some further views\r\nwill be submitted to Congress for rendering its security entirely\r\nadequate against naval enterprise. A view of what has been\r\ndone at the several places, and of what is proposed to be done,\r\nshall be communicated as soon as the several reports are received.\r\n\r\nOf the gun-boats authorized by the act of December last, it\r\nhas been thought necessary to build only one hundred and three\r\nin the present year. These, with those before possessed, are sufficient\r\nfor the harbors and waters exposed, and the residue will\r\nrequire little time for their construction when it is deemed necessary.\r\n\r\nUnder the act of the last session for raising an additional military\r\nforce, so many officers were immediately appointed as were\r\nnecessary for carrying on the business of recruiting, and in proportion\r\nas it advanced, others have been added. We have reason\r\nto believe their success has been satisfactory, although such returns\r\nhave not yet been received as enable me to present to you\r\na statement of the numbers engaged.\r\n\r\nI have not thought it necessary in the course of the last\r\nseason to call for any general detachments of militia or volunteers\r\nunder the law passed for that purpose. For the ensuing\r\nseason, however, they will require to be in readiness should their\r\nservices be wanted. Some small and special detachments have\r\nbeen necessary to maintain the laws of embargo on that portion\r\nof our northern frontier which offered peculiar facilities for\r\nevasion, but these were replaced as soon as it could be done by\r\nbodies of new recruits. By the aid of these, and of the armed\r\nvessels called into actual service in other quarters, the spirit of\r\ndisobedience and abuse which manifested itself early, and with\r\nsensible effect while we were unprepared to meet it, has been\r\nconsiderably repressed.\r\n\r\nConsidering the extraordinary character of the times in which\r\nwe live, our attention should unremittingly be fixed on the\r\nsafety of our country. For a people who are free, and who\r\nmean to remain so, a well-organized and armed militia is their\r\nbest security. It is, therefore, incumbent on us, at every meeting,\r\nto revise the condition of the militia, and to ask ourselves if\r\nit is prepared to repel a powerful enemy at every point of our\r\nterritories exposed to invasion. Some of the States have paid a\r\nlaudable attention to this object; but every degree of neglect is\r\nto be found among others. Congress alone have power to produce\r\na uniform state of preparation in this great organ of defence;\r\nthe interests which they so deeply feel in their own and\r\ntheir country's security will present this as among the most important\r\nobjects of their deliberation.\r\n\r\nUnder the acts of March 11th and April 23d, respecting arms,\r\nthe difficulty of procuring them from abroad, during the present\r\nsituation and dispositions of Europe, induced us to direct our\r\nwhole efforts to the means of internal supply. The public factories\r\nhave, therefore, been enlarged, additional machineries\r\nerected, and in proportion as artificers can be found or formed,\r\ntheir effect, already more than doubled, may be increased so as\r\nto keep pace with the yearly increase of the militia. The annual\r\nsums appropriated by the latter act, have been directed to\r\nthe encouragement of private factories of arms, and contracts\r\nhave been entered into with individual undertakers to nearly the\r\namount of the first year's appropriation.\r\n\r\nThe suspension of our foreign commerce, produced by the injustice\r\nof the belligerent powers, and the consequent losses and\r\nsacrifices of our citizens, are subjects of just concern. The situation\r\ninto which we have thus been forced, has impelled us to\r\napply a portion of our industry and capital to internal manufactures\r\nand improvements. The extent of this conversion is daily increasing,\r\nand little doubt remains that the establishments formed and\r\nforming will--under the auspices of cheaper materials and subsistence,\r\nthe freedom of labor from taxation with us, and of protecting\r\nduties and prohibitions--become permanent. The commerce\r\nwith the Indians, too, within our own boundaries, is likely\r\nto receive abundant aliment from the same internal source, and\r\nwill secure to them peace and the progress of civilization, undisturbed\r\nby practices hostile to both.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of the receipts and expenditures during the\r\nyear ending on the 30th day of September last, being not yet\r\nmade up, a correct statement will hereafter be transmitted from\r\nthe Treasury. In the meantime, it is ascertained that the receipts\r\nhave amounted to near eighteen millions of dollars, which, with\r\nthe eight millions and a half in the treasury at the beginning of\r\nthe year, have enabled us, after meeting the current demands\r\nand interest incurred, to pay two millions three hundred thousand\r\ndollars of the principal of our funded debt, and left us in\r\nthe treasury, on that day, near fourteen millions of dollars. Of\r\nthese, five millions three hundred and fifty thousand dollars will\r\nbe necessary to pay what will be due on the first day of January\r\nnext, which will complete the reimbursement of the eight per\r\ncent. stock. These payments, with those made in the six years\r\nand a half preceding, will have extinguished thirty-three millions\r\nfive hundred and eighty thousand dollars of the principal of the\r\nfunded debt, being the whole which could be paid or purchased\r\nwithin the limits of the law and our contracts; and the amount\r\nof principal thus discharged will have liberated the revenue from\r\nabout two millions of dollars of interest, and added that sum annually\r\nto the disposable surplus. The probable accumulation of\r\nthe surpluses of revenue beyond what can be applied to the payment\r\nof the public debt, whenever the freedom and safety of our\r\ncommerce shall be restored, merits the consideration of Congress.\r\nShall it lie unproductive in the public vaults? Shall the\r\nrevenue be reduced? Or shall it rather be appropriated to the\r\nimprovements of roads, canals, rivers, education, and other great\r\nfoundations of prosperity and union, under the powers which\r\nCongress may already possess, or such amendment of the constitution\r\nas may be approved by the States? While uncertain of\r\nthe course of things, the time may be advantageously employed\r\nin obtaining the powers necessary for a system of improvement,\r\nshould that be thought best.\r\n\r\nAvailing myself of this the last occasion which will occur of\r\naddressing the two houses of the legislature at their meeting, I\r\ncannot omit the expression of my sincere gratitude for the repeated\r\nproofs of confidence manifested to me by themselves and\r\ntheir predecessors since my call to the administration, and the\r\nmany indulgences experienced at their hands. The same grateful\r\nacknowledgments are due to my fellow citizens generally,\r\nwhose support has been my great encouragement under all embarrassments.\r\nIn the transaction of their business I cannot have\r\nescaped error. It is incident to our imperfect nature. But I may\r\nsay with truth, my errors have been of the understanding, not\r\nof intention; and that the advancement of their rights and interests\r\nhas been the constant motive for every measure. On\r\nthese considerations I solicit their indulgence. Looking forward\r\nwith anxiety to their future destinies, I trust that, in their\r\nsteady character unshaken by difficulties, in their love of liberty,\r\nobedience to law, and support of the public authorities, I see a\r\nsure guaranty of the permanence of our republic; and retiring\r\nfrom the charge of their affairs, I carry with me the consolation\r\nof a firm persuasion that Heaven has in store for our beloved\r\ncountry long ages to come of prosperity and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--DECEMBER 30, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nI lay before the legislature a letter from Governor Claiborne,\r\non the subject of a small tribe of Alabama Indians, on the western\r\nside of the Mississippi, consisting of about a dozen families.\r\nLike other erratic tribes in that country, it is understood that\r\nthey have hitherto moved from place to place, according to their\r\nconvenience, without appropriating to themselves exclusively\r\nany particular territory. But having now become habituated to\r\nsome of the occupations of civilized life, they wish for a fixed\r\nresidence. I suppose it will be the interest of the United States\r\nto encourage the wandering tribes of that country to reduce\r\nthemselves to fixed habitations, whenever they are so disposed.\r\nThe establishment of towns, and growing attachment to them,\r\nwill furnish, in some degree, pledges of their peaceable and\r\nfriendly conduct. The case of this particular tribe is now submitted\r\nto the consideration of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL MESSAGE.--JANUARY 6, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates_:--\r\n\r\nI now lay before Congress a statement of the works of defence\r\nwhich it has been thought necessary to provide in the first\r\ninstance, for the security of our seaports, towns, and harbors, and\r\nof the progress toward their completion; their extent has been\r\nadapted to the scale of the appropriation, and to the circumstances\r\nof the several places.\r\n\r\nThe works undertaken at New York are calculated to annoy\r\nand endanger any naval force which shall enter the harbor, and,\r\nstill more, one which should attempt to lie before the city. To\r\nprevent altogether the entrance of large vessels, a line of blocks\r\nacross the harbor has been contemplated, and would, as is believed,\r\nwith the auxiliary means already provided, render that\r\ncity safe against naval enterprise. The expense, as well as the\r\nimportance of the work, renders it a subject proper for the special\r\nconsideration of Congress.\r\n\r\nAt New Orleans, two separate systems of defence are necessary;\r\nthe one for the river, the other for the lake, which, at present,\r\ncan give no aid to one another. The canal now leading\r\nfrom the lake, if continued into the river, would enable the\r\narmed vessels in both stations to unite, and to meet in conjunction\r\nan attack from either side; half the aggregate force would\r\nthen have the same effect as the whole; or the same force double\r\nthe effect of what either can have. It would also enable the\r\nvessels stationed in the lake, when attacked by superior force, to\r\nretire to a safer position in the river. The same considerations\r\nof expense and importance renders this also a question for the\r\nspecial decision of Congress.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCircumstances, fellow citizens, which seriously threatened the\r\npeace of our country, have made it a duty to convene you at an\r\nearlier period than usual. The love of peace, so much cherished\r\nin the bosoms of our citizens, which has so long guided the proceedings\r\nof the public councils, and induced forbearance under\r\nso many wrongs, may not insure our continuance in the quiet\r\n_States_:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nREPLIES TO PUBLIC ADDRESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMESSRS. NEHEMIAH DODGE, EPHRAIM ROBBINS, AND STEPHEN S. NELSON, A\r\nCOMMITTEE OF THE DANBURY BAPTIST ASSOCIATION, IN THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT.\r\n\r\n                                                      January 1, 1802.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--The affectionate sentiments of esteem and approbation\r\nwhich you are so good as to express towards me, on\r\nbehalf of the Danbury Baptist Association, give me the highest\r\nsatisfaction. My duties dictate a faithful and zealous pursuit of\r\nthe interests of my constituents, and in proportion as they are\r\npersuaded of my fidelity to those duties, the discharge of them\r\nbecomes more and more pleasing.\r\n\r\nBelieving with you that religion is a matter which lies solely\r\nbetween man and his God, that he owes account to none other\r\nfor his faith or his worship, that the legislative powers of government\r\nreach actions only, and not opinions, I contemplate with\r\nsovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which\r\ndeclared that their legislature should \"make no law respecting an\r\nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,\"\r\nthus building a wall of separation between church and State.\r\nAdhering to this expression of the supreme will of the nation in\r\nbehalf of the rights of conscience, I shall see with sincere satisfaction\r\nthe progress of those sentiments which tend to restore to\r\nman all his natural rights, convinced he has no natural right in\r\nopposition to his social duties.\r\n\r\nI reciprocate your kind prayers for the protection and blessing\r\nof the common Father and Creator of man, and tender you for\r\nyourselves and your religious association, assurances of my high\r\nrespect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM JUDD, ESQUIRE, CHAIRMAN.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, November 15, 1802.\r\n\r\nExpressions of confidence from the respectable description of\r\nmy fellow citizens, in whose name you have been pleased to address\r\nme, are received with that cordial satisfaction which kindred\r\nprinciples and sentiments naturally inspire.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings which they approve were sincerely intended\r\nfor the general good; and if, as we hope, they should in event\r\nproduce it, they will be indebted for it to the wisdom of our legislative\r\ncouncils, and of those distinguished fellow laborers whom\r\nthe laws have permitted me to associate in the general administration.\r\n\r\nExercising that discretion which the constitution has confided\r\nto me in the choice of public agents, I have been sensible,\r\non the one hand, of the justice done to those who have been systematically\r\nexcluded from the service of their country, and attentive,\r\non the other, to restore justice in such a way as might least\r\naffect the sympathies and the tranquillity of the public mind.\r\nDeaths, resignations, delinquencies, malignant and active opposition\r\nto the order of things established by the will of the nation,\r\nwill, it is believed, within a moderate space of time, make room\r\nfor a just participation in the management of the public affairs;\r\nand that being once effected, future changes at the helm will be\r\nviewed with tranquillity by those in subordinate station.\r\n\r\nEvery wish of my heart will be completely gratified when\r\nthat portion of my fellow citizens which has been misled as to\r\nthe character of our measures and principles, shall, by their salutary\r\neffects, be corrected in their opinions, and joining with good\r\nwill the great mass of their fellow citizens, consolidate an union\r\nwhich cannot be too much cherished.\r\n\r\nI pray you, Sir, to accept for yourself, and for the general\r\nmeeting of the Republicans of the State of Connecticut at New\r\nHaven, whose sentiments you have been so good as to convey\r\nto me, assurances of my high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF TENNESSEE.\r\n\r\n                                                    December 24, 1803.\r\n\r\nAmidst the anxieties which are felt for the favorable issue of\r\nmeasures adopted for promoting the public good, it is a consolation\r\nto meet the approbation of those on whose behalf they are\r\ninstituted. I shall certainly endeavor to merit a continuance of\r\nthe good opinion which the legislature of Tennessee have been\r\npleased to express in their address of the 8th November, by a\r\nzealous attention to the interests of my constituents; and shall\r\ncount on a candid indulgence whenever untoward events may\r\nhappen to disappoint well-founded expectations.\r\n\r\nIn availing our western brethren of those circumstances which\r\noccur for promoting their interests, we only perform that duty\r\nwhich we owe to every portion of the Union, under occurrences\r\nequally favorable; and, impressed with the inconveniences to\r\nwhich the citizens of Tennessee are subjected by a want of contiguity\r\nin the portions composing their State, I shall be ready to\r\ndo for their relief, whatever the general legislature may authorize,\r\nand justice to our neighbors permit.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of Louisiana, although more immediately\r\nbeneficial to the western States, by securing for their produce a\r\ncertain market, not subject to interruption by officers over whom\r\nwe have no control, yet is also deeply interesting to the maritime\r\nportion of our country, inasmuch as by giving the exclusive\r\nnavigation of the Mississippi, it avoids the burthens and sufferings\r\nof a war, which conflicting interests on that river would inevitably\r\nhave produced at no distant period. It opens, too, a fertile\r\nregion for the future establishments in the progress of that multiplication\r\nso rapidly taking place in all parts.\r\n\r\nI have seen with great satisfaction the promptitude with which\r\nthe first portions of your militia repaired to the standard of their\r\ncountry. It was deemed best to provide a force equal to any\r\nevent which might arise out of the transaction, and especially to\r\nthe preservation of order, among our newly-associated brethren,\r\nin the first moments of their transition from one authority to another.\r\nI tender to the legislature of Tennessee assurances of my\r\nhigh respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE TWO BRANCHES OF THE LEGISLATURE OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n                                                    February 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nIt is with sincere pleasure that I receive, from the two branches\r\nof the legislature of Massachusetts, an address, expressive of their\r\nsatisfaction with the administration of our government. The\r\napprobation of my constituents is truly the most valued reward\r\nfor any services it has fallen to my lot to render them--their confidence\r\nand esteem, the greatest consolation of my life. The\r\nmeasures which you have been pleased particularly to note, I\r\nhave believed to have been for the best interests of our country.\r\nBut far from assuming their merit to myself, they belong first, to\r\na wise and patriotic legislature, which has given them the form\r\nand sanction of law, and next, to my faithful and able fellow-laborers\r\nin the Executive administration.\r\n\r\nThe progression of sentiment in the great body of our fellow\r\ncitizens of Massachusetts, and the increasing support of their\r\nopinion, I have seen with satisfaction, and was ever confident I\r\nshould see; persuaded that an enlightened people, whenever they\r\nshould view impartially the course we have pursued, could never\r\nwish that our measures should have been reversed; could never\r\ndesire that the expenses of the government should have been increased,\r\ntaxes multiplied, debt accumulated, wars undertaken,\r\nand the tomahawk and scalping knife left in the hands of our\r\nneighbors, rather than the hoe and plough. In whatever tended\r\nto strengthen the republican features of our constitution, we\r\ncould not fail to expect from Massachusetts, the cradle of our\r\nrevolutionary principles, an ultimate concurrence; and cultivating\r\nthe peace of nations, with justice and prudence, we yet were always\r\nconfident that, whenever our rights would be to be vindicated\r\nagainst the aggression of foreign foes, or the machinations\r\nof internal conspirators, the people of Massachusetts, so prominent\r\nin the military achievements which placed our country in the\r\nright of self-government, would never be found wanting in their\r\nduty to the calls of their country, or the requisitions of their\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nDuring the term, which yet remains, of my continuance in the\r\nstation assigned me, your confidence shall not be disappointed,\r\nso far as faithful endeavors for your service can merit it.\r\n\r\nI feel with particular sensibility your kind expressions towards\r\nmyself personally; and I pray that that Providence in whose\r\nhand are the nations of the earth, may continue towards ours\r\nhis fostering care, and bestow on yourselves the blessings of His\r\nprotection and favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE, AND SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF\r\nREPRESENTATIVES OF MASSACHUSETTS.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, February 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I acknowledge, in the first moment it has been\r\nin my power, the receipt of your joint letter of January 26th,\r\nwith the address of the two branches of legislature of Massachusetts,\r\nexpressing their approbation of the proceedings of our government.\r\nThis declaration cannot fail to give particular and\r\ngeneral satisfaction to our fellow citizens, and to produce wholesome\r\neffects at home and abroad. The remarkable union of\r\nsentiment which pervaded nearly the whole of the States and\r\nterritories composing our nation, was such, indeed, as to inspire\r\na just confidence in the course we had to pursue. Yet something\r\nwas sensibly wanting to fill up the measure of our happiness,\r\nwhile a member so important, so esteemed as Massachusetts,\r\nhad not yet declared its participation in the common sentiment.\r\nThat it is now done, will be a subject of mutual congratulation.\r\n\r\nI am sensible that the terms in which you have been pleased\r\nto make this communication, are not merely those of official duty.\r\nI feel how much I am indebted to the kind and friendly disposition\r\nthey manifest; and I cherish them as proofs of an esteem\r\nhighly valued.\r\n\r\nPermit me, through you, to return to the two branches of the\r\nlegislature the enclosed answer, and accept the assurances of my\r\nesteem and high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. THOMAS, ELLICOT, AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n                                                    November 13, 1807.\r\n\r\nFRIENDS AND FELLOW CITIZENS,--I thank you for the address\r\nyou have kindly presented me, on behalf of that portion of the\r\nSociety of Friends of which you are the representatives, and I\r\nlearn with satisfaction their approbation of the principles which\r\nhave influenced the councils of the general government in their\r\ndecisions on several important subjects confided to them.\r\n\r\nThe desire to preserve our country from the calamities and\r\nravages of war, by cultivating a disposition, and pursuing a conduct,\r\nconciliatory and friendly to all nations, has been sincerely\r\nentertained and faithfully followed. It was dictated by the principles\r\nof humanity, the precepts of the gospel, and the general\r\nwish of our country, and it was not to be doubted that the Society\r\nof Friends, with whom it is a _religious_ principle, would sanction\r\nit by their support.\r\n\r\nThe same philanthropic motives have directed the public endeavors\r\nto ameliorate the condition of the Indian natives, by introducing\r\namong them a knowledge of agriculture and some of\r\nthe mechanic arts, by encouraging them to resort to these as\r\nmore certain, and less laborious resources for subsistence than the\r\nchase; and by withholding from them the pernicious supplies of\r\nardent spirits. They are our brethren, our neighbors; they may\r\nbe valuable friends, and troublesome enemies. Both duty and\r\ninterest then enjoin, that we should extend to them the blessings\r\nof civilized life, and prepare their minds for becoming useful\r\nmembers of the American family. In this important work I owe\r\nto your society an acknowledgment that we have felt the benefits\r\nof their zealous co-operation, and approved its judicious direction\r\ntowards producing among those people habits of industry,\r\ncomfortable subsistence, and civilized usages, as preparatory to\r\nreligious instruction and the cultivation of letters.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the circumstances which influenced\r\nour forefathers to permit the introduction of personal bondage\r\ninto any part of these States, and to participate in the wrongs\r\ncommitted on an unoffending quarter of the globe, we may rejoice\r\nthat such circumstances, and such a sense of them, exist no\r\nlonger. It is honorable to the nation at large that their legislature\r\navailed themselves of the first practicable moment for arresting\r\nthe progress of this great moral and political error; and I sincerely\r\npray with you, my friends, that all the members of the\r\nhuman family may, in the time prescribed by the Father of us\r\nall, find themselves securely established in the enjoyment of life,\r\nliberty, and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN JOHN THOMAS.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, November 18, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received on the 14th instant your favor of August 31,\r\nand I beg you to assure my fellow citizens of the Baptist church\r\nof Newhope meeting-house, that I learn with great satisfaction\r\ntheir approbation of the principles which have guided the present\r\nadministration of the government. To cherish and maintain the\r\nrights and liberties of our citizens, and to ward from them the\r\nburthens, the miseries, and the crimes of war, by a just and\r\nfriendly conduct towards all nations, were among the most obvious\r\nand important duties of those to whom the management of\r\ntheir public interests have been confided; and happy shall we be\r\nif a conduct guided by these views on our part, shall secure to us\r\na reciprocation of peace and justice from other nations.\r\n\r\nAmong the most inestimable of our blessings, also, is that you\r\nso justly particularize, of liberty to worship our Creator in the\r\nway we think most agreeable to his will; a liberty deemed in\r\nother counties incompatible with good government, and yet\r\nproved by our experience to be its best support.\r\n\r\nYour confidence in my dispositions to befriend every human\r\nright is highly grateful to me, and is rendered the more so by a\r\nconsciousness that these dispositions have been sincerely entertained\r\nand pursued. I am thankful for the kindness expressed\r\ntowards me personally, and pray you to return to the society in\r\nwhose name you have addressed me, my best wishes for their\r\nhappiness and prosperity; and to accept for yourself assurances\r\nof my great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                         WASHINGTON, December 1, 1807.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Secretary of State has communicated to me your\r\nletter to him of the 14th of November, covering the resolutions\r\nof the General Assembly of Vermont of the 4th of the same\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments expressed by the General Assembly of Vermont\r\non the late hostile attack on the Chesapeake by the Leopard\r\nship-of-war, as well as on other violations of our maritime and\r\nterritorial rights, are worthy of their known patriotism; and their\r\nreadiness to rally around the constituted authorities of their country,\r\nand to support its rights with their lives and fortunes, is the\r\nmore honorable to them as exposed by their position, in front of\r\nthe contest. The issue of the present misunderstandings cannot\r\nnow be foreseen; but the measures adopted for their settlement\r\nhave been sincerely directed to maintain the rights, the honor,\r\nthe peace of our country; and the approbation of them expressed\r\nby the General Assembly is to me a confirmation of their correctness.\r\n\r\nThe confidence they are pleased to declare in my personal\r\ncare of the public interests, is highly gratifying to me, and gives\r\na new claim to everything which zeal can effect for their service.\r\n\r\nI beg leave to tender to the General Assembly of Vermont, and\r\nto yourself, the assurances of my high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF VERMONT.\r\n\r\n                                                    December 10, 1807.\r\n\r\nI received in due season the _address_ of the Legislature of\r\nVermont, bearing date the 5th of November 1806, in which, with\r\ntheir approbation of the general course of my administration,\r\nthey were so good as to express their desire that I would consent\r\nto be proposed again, to the public voice, on the expiration of\r\nmy present term of office. Entertaining, as I do, for the legislature\r\nof Vermont those sentiments of high respect which would\r\nhave prompted an immediate answer, I was certain, nevertheless,\r\nthey would approve a delay which had for its object to avoid a\r\npremature agitation of the public mind, on a subject so interesting\r\nas the election of a chief magistrate.\r\n\r\nThat I should lay down my charge at a proper period, is as\r\nmuch a duty as to have borne it faithfully. If some termination\r\nto the services of the chief magistrate be not fixed by the\r\nconstitution, or supplied by practice, his office, nominally for\r\nyears, will, in fact, become for life; and history shows how easily\r\nthat degenerates into an inheritance. Believing that a representative\r\ngovernment, responsible at short periods of election, is that\r\nwhich produces the greatest sum of happiness to mankind, I feel\r\nit a duty to do no act which shall essentially impair that principle;\r\nand I should unwillingly be the person who, disregarding\r\nthe sound precedent set by an illustrious predecessor, should furnish\r\nthe first example of prolongation beyond the second term\r\nof office.\r\n\r\nTruth, also, requires me to add, that I am sensible of that decline\r\nwhich advancing years bring on; and feeling their physical,\r\nI ought not to doubt their mental effect. Happy if I am the\r\nfirst to perceive and to obey this admonition of nature, and to\r\nsolicit a retreat from cares too great for the wearied faculties\r\nof age.\r\n\r\nFor the approbation which the legislature of Vermont has been\r\npleased to express of the principles and measures pursued in the\r\nmanagement of their affairs, I am sincerely thankful; and should\r\nI be so fortunate as to carry into retirement the equal approbation\r\nand good will of my fellow citizens generally, it will be the\r\ncomfort of my future days, and will close a service of forty\r\nyears with the only reward it ever wished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Addresses approving the general course of his administration, were also\r\nreceived from Georgia, December 6th, 1806; from Rhode Island, February\r\n27th, 1807; from New York, March 13th, 1807; from Pennsylvania, March\r\n13th, 1807; and from Maryland, January 3d, 1807; to all which answers\r\nlike that sent to Vermont, were returned.\"--_Ed._\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF NEW JERSEY IN\r\nTHEIR LEGISLATURE.\r\n\r\n                                                    December 10, 1807.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments, fellow citizens, which you are pleased to express\r\nin your address of the 4th inst., of attachment and esteem\r\nfor the general government, and of confidence and approbation\r\nof those who direct its councils, cannot but be pleasing to the\r\nfriends of union generally, and give a new claim on all those\r\nwho direct the public affairs, for everything which zeal can effect\r\nfor the good of their country.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed to be deplored that distant as we are from the\r\nstorms and convulsions which agitate the European world, the\r\npursuit of an honest neutrality, beyond the reach of reproach,\r\nhas been insufficient to secure to us the certain enjoyment of\r\npeace with those whose interests as well as ours would be promoted\r\nby it. What will be the issue of present misunderstandings\r\ncannot as yet be foreseen; but the measures adopted for\r\ntheir settlement have been sincerely directed to maintain the\r\nrights, the honor, and the peace of our country. Should they\r\nfail, the ardor of our citizens to obey the summons of their\r\ncountry, and the offer which you attest, of their lives and fortunes\r\nin its support, are worthy of their patriotism, and are\r\npledges of our safety.\r\n\r\nThe suppression of the late conspiracy by the hand of the\r\npeople, uplifted to destroy it whenever it reared its head, manifests\r\ntheir fitness for self-government, and the power of a nation,\r\nof which every individual feels that his own will is a part of\r\nthe public authority.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the public contributions in reducing the national\r\ndebt, and liberating our resources from the canker of interest,\r\nhas been so far salutary, and encourages us to continue in the\r\nsame course; or, if necessarily interrupted, to resume it as soon\r\nas practicable.\r\n\r\nI perceive with sincere pleasure that my conduct in the chief\r\nmagistracy has so far met your approbation, that my continuance\r\nin that office, after its present term, would be acceptable to you.\r\nBut that I should lay down my charge at a proper period is as\r\nmuch a duty as to have borne it faithfully. If some termination\r\nto the services of the chief magistrate be not fixed by the constitution,\r\nor supplied by practice, his office, nominally for years,\r\nwill, in fact, become for life, and history shows how easily that\r\ndegenerates into an inheritance. Believing that a representative\r\ngovernment, responsible at short periods of election, is that\r\nwhich produces the greatest sum of happiness to mankind, I feel\r\nit a duty to do no act which shall essentially impair that principle;\r\nand I should unwillingly be the person who, disregarding the\r\nsound precedent set by an illustrious predecessor, should furnish\r\nthe first example of prolongation beyond the second term of office.\r\n\r\nTruth also obliges me to add, that I am sensible of that decline\r\nwhich advancing years bring on, and feeling their physical,\r\nI ought not to doubt their mental effect. Happy if I am the\r\nfirst to perceive and to obey this admonition of nature, and to\r\nsolicit a retreat from cares too great for the wearied faculties of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nDeclining a re-election on grounds which cannot but be approved,\r\nI am sincerely thankful for the approbation which the\r\nLegislature of New Jersey are pleased to manifest of the principles\r\nand measures pursued in the management of their affairs;\r\nand should I be so fortunate as to carry into retirement the equal\r\napprobation and good will of my fellow citizens generally, it\r\nwill be the comfort of my future days, and will close a service\r\nof forty years with the only reward it ever wished.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE TAMMANY SOCIETY OF THE CITY OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                    December 14, 1807.\r\n\r\nThe appearances for some time past, threatening our peace,\r\nfellow citizens, have justly excited a general anxiety; and I have\r\nbeen happy to receive from every quarter of the Union the most\r\nsatisfactory assurances of fidelity to our country, and of devotion\r\nto the support of its rights. Your concurrence in these sentiments,\r\nexpressed in the address you have been pleased to present\r\nme, is a proof of your patriotism, and of that firm spirit which\r\nconstitutes the ultimate appeal of nations. What will be the\r\nissue of present misunderstandings, is, as yet, unknown. But, willing\r\nourselves to do justice to others, we ought to expect it from\r\nthem. If any among us view erroneously the rights which late\r\nevents have brought into question, let us hope that they will be\r\ncorrected by the further investigation of reason; but, at all\r\nevents, that they will acquiesce in what their country shall\r\nauthoritatively decide, and arrange themselves faithfully under\r\nthe banners of the law.\r\n\r\nYour approbation of the measures which have been pursued,\r\nis a pleasing confirmation of their correctness; and, with particular\r\nthankfulness for the kind expressions of your address towards\r\nmyself personally, I reciprocate sincere wishes for your welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. ABNER WATKINS AND BERNARD TODD.\r\n\r\n                                                  December 21st, 1807.\r\n\r\nI have duly received, fellow citizens, the address of October\r\n21st, which you have been so kind as to forward me on the\r\npart of the society of Baptists, of the Appomatox Association, and\r\nit is with great satisfaction when I learn from my constituents\r\nthat the measures pursued in the administration of their affairs,\r\nduring the time I have occupied the presidential chair, have met\r\ntheir approbation. Of the wisdom of these measures, it belongs\r\nto others to judge; that they have always been dictated by a desire\r\nto do what should be most for the public good, I may conscientiously\r\naffirm. Believing that a definite period of retiring\r\nfrom this station will tend materially to secure our elective form\r\nof government; and sensible, too, of that decline which advancing\r\nyears bring on, I have felt it a duty to withdraw at the close\r\nof my present term of office; and to strengthen by practice a\r\nprinciple which I deem salutary. That others may be found\r\nwhose talents and integrity render them proper deposits of the\r\npublic liberty and interests, and who have made themselves\r\nknown by their eminent services, we can all affirm, of our\r\npersonal knowledge. To us it will belong, fellow citizens,\r\nwhen their country shall have called them to its helm, to give\r\nthem our support while there, to facilitate their honest efforts for\r\nthe public good, even where other measures might seem to us\r\nmore direct, to strengthen the arm of our country by union under\r\nthem, and to reserve ourselves for judging them at the constitutional\r\nperiod of election.\r\n\r\nI pray you to tender to your society, of which you are a committee,\r\nmy thanks for the indulgence with which they have\r\nviewed my conduct, with the assurance of my high respect, and\r\nto accept yourselves my friendly and respectful salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF NORTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n                                                     January 10, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe wrongs our country has suffered, fellow citizens, by violations\r\nof those moral rules which the Author of our nature has\r\nimplanted in man as the law of his nature, to govern him in his\r\nassociated, as well as individual character, have been such as\r\njustly to excite the sensibilities you express, and a deep abhorrence\r\nat indications threatening a substitution of power for right\r\nin the intercourse between nations. Not less worthy of your\r\nindignation have been the machinations of parricides who have\r\nendeavored to bring into danger the union of these States, and\r\nto subvert, for the purposes of inordinate ambition, a government\r\nfounded in the will of its citizens, and directed to no object\r\nbut their happiness.\r\n\r\nI learn, with the liveliest sentiments of gratitude and respect,\r\nyour approbation of my conduct, in the various charges which\r\nmy country has been pleased to confide to me at different times;\r\nand especially that the administration of our public affairs, since\r\nmy accession to the chief magistracy, has been so far satisfactory,\r\nthat my continuance in that office after its present term, would\r\nbe acceptable to you. But, that I should lay down my charge\r\nat a proper period, is as much a duty as to have borne it faithfully.\r\nIf some termination to the services of the chief magistrate\r\nbe not fixed by the constitution, or supplied by practice, his\r\noffice, nominally for years, will in fact become for life; and history\r\nshows how easily that degenerates into an inheritance.\r\nBelieving that a representative government, responsible at short\r\nperiods of election, is that which produces the greatest sum of\r\nhappiness to mankind, I feel it a duty to do no act which shall\r\nessentially impair that principle; and I should unwillingly be the\r\nperson who, disregarding the sound precedent set by an illustrious\r\npredecessor, should furnish the first example of prolongation\r\nbeyond the second term of office.\r\n\r\nTruth also obliges me to add, that I am sensible of that decline\r\nwhich advancing years bring on; and feeling their physical,\r\nI ought not to doubt their mental effect. Happy if I am\r\nthe first to perceive and obey this admonition of nature, and to\r\nsolicit a retreat from cares too great for the wearied faculties of\r\nage.\r\n\r\nDeclining a re-election on grounds which cannot but be approved,\r\nit will be the great comfort of my future days, and the\r\nsatisfactory reward of a service of forty years, to carry into retirement\r\nsuch testimonies as you have been pleased to give, of\r\nthe approbation and good will of my fellow citizens generally.\r\nAnd I supplicate the Being in whose hands we all are, to preserve\r\nour country in freedom and independence, and to bestow\r\non yourselves the blessings of his favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SOCIETY OF TAMMANY, OR COLUMBIAN ORDER, NO. 1, OF\r\nTHE CITY OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n                                                    February 29, 1808.\r\n\r\nI have received your address, fellow citizens, and, thankful\r\nfor the expressions so personally gratifying to myself, I contemplate\r\nwith high satisfaction the ardent spirit it breathes of\r\nlove to our country, and of devotion to its liberty and independence.\r\nThe crisis in which it is placed, cannot but be unwelcome\r\nto those who love peace, yet spurn at a tame submission to\r\nwrong. So fortunately remote from the theatre of European\r\ncontests, and carefully avoiding to implicate ourselves in them,\r\nwe had a right to hope for an exemption from the calamities\r\nwhich have afflicted the contending nations, and to be permitted\r\nunoffendingly to pursue paths of industry and peace.\r\n\r\nBut the ocean, which, like the air, is the common birth-right\r\nof mankind, is arbitrarily wrested from us, and maxims consecrated\r\nby time, by usage, and by an universal sense of right, are\r\ntrampled on by superior force. To give time for this demoralizing\r\ntempest to pass over, one measure only remained which\r\nmight cover our beloved country from its overwhelming fury:\r\nan appeal to the deliberate understanding of our fellow citizens\r\nin a cessation of all intercourse with the belligerent nations,\r\nuntil it can be resumed under the protection of a returning sense\r\nof the moral obligations which constitute a law for nations as\r\nwell as individuals. There can be no question, in a mind truly\r\nAmerican, whether it is best to send our citizens and property\r\ninto certain captivity, and then wage war for their recovery, or\r\nto keep them at home, and to turn seriously to that policy which\r\nplants the manufacturer and the husbandman side by side, and\r\nestablishes at the door of every one that exchange of mutual\r\nlabors and comforts, which we have hitherto sought in distant\r\nregions, and under perpetual risk of broils with them. Between\r\nthese alternatives your address has soundly decided, and I doubt\r\nnot your aid, and that of every real and faithful citizen, towards\r\ncarrying into effect the measures of your country, and enforcing\r\nthe sacred principle, that in opposing foreign wrong there must\r\nbe but one mind.\r\n\r\nI receive with sensibility your kind prayers for my future happiness,\r\nand I supplicate a protecting providence to watch over\r\nyour own and our country's freedom and welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE DELEGATES OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICANS OF THE CITY\r\nOF PHILADELPHIA IN GENERAL WARD COMMITTEE ASSEMBLED.\r\n\r\n                                                         May 25, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe epoch, fellow citizens, into which our lot has fallen, has\r\nindeed been fruitful of events, which require vigilance, and embarrass\r\ndeliberation. That during such a period of difficulty,\r\nand amidst the perils surrounding us, the public measures which\r\nhave been pursued should meet your approbation, is a source of\r\ngreat satisfaction. It was not expected in this age, that nations\r\nso honorably distinguished by their advances in science and civilization,\r\nwould suddenly cast away the esteem they had merited\r\nfrom the world, and, revolting from the empire of morality, assume\r\na character in history, which all the tears of their posterity\r\nwill never wash from its pages. But during this delirium of the\r\nwarring powers, the ocean having become a field of lawless violence,\r\na suspension of our navigation for a time was equally necessary\r\nto avoid contest, or enter it with advantage. This measure\r\nwill, indeed, produce some temporary inconvenience; but\r\npromises lasting good by promoting among ourselves the establishment\r\nof manufactures hitherto sought abroad, at the risk of\r\ncollisions no longer regulated by the laws of reason or morality.\r\n\r\nIt is to be lamented that any of our citizens, not thinking with\r\nthe mass of the nation as to the principles of our government, or\r\nof its administration, and seeing all its proceedings with a prejudiced\r\neye, should so misconceive and misrepresent our situation\r\nas to encourage aggressions from foreign nations. Our expectation\r\nis, that their distempered views will be understood by others\r\nas they are by ourselves; but should wars be the consequence\r\nof these delusions, and the errors of our dissatisfied citizens find\r\natonement only in the blood of their sounder brethren, we must\r\nmeet it as an evil necessarily flowing from that liberty of speaking\r\nand writing which guards our other liberties; and I have entire\r\nconfidence in the assurances that your ardor will be animated,\r\nin the conflicts brought on, by considerations of the necessity,\r\nhonor, and justice of our cause.\r\n\r\nI sincerely thank you, fellow citizens, for the concern you so\r\nkindly express for my future happiness. It is a high and abundant\r\nreward for endeavors to be useful; and I supplicate the care\r\nof Providence over the well-being of yourselves and our beloved\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE, COUNCIL, AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF\r\nTHE TERRITORY OF ORLEANS.\r\n\r\n                                            WASHINGTON, June 18, 1808.\r\n\r\nI received, fellow citizens, with a just sensibility, the expressions\r\nof esteem and approbation, communicated in your kind address\r\nof the 29th of March, and am thankful for them. The\r\nmotives which have led to my retirement from office were dictated\r\nby a sense of duty, and will, I trust, be approved by my\r\nfellow citizens generally.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a source of real concern that an impartial neutrality\r\nscrupulously observed towards the belligerent nations of Europe,\r\nhas not been sufficient to protect us against encroachments\r\non our rights; and, although deprecating war, should no alternative\r\nbe presented us but disgraceful submission to unlawful pretensions,\r\nI have entire confidence in your assurances that you\r\nwill cheerfully submit to whatever sacrifices and privations may\r\nbe necessary for vindicating the rights, the honor, and independence\r\nof our nation.\r\n\r\nFar from a disposition to avail ourselves of the peculiar situation\r\nof any belligerent nation to ask concessions incompatible\r\nwith their rights, with justice, or reciprocity, we have never proposed\r\nto any the sacrifice of a single right; and in consideration\r\nof existing circumstances, we have ever been willing, where our\r\nduty to other nations permitted us, to relax for a time, and in\r\nsome cases, that strictness of right which the laws of nature, the\r\nacknowledgments of the civilized world, and the equality and\r\nindependence of nations entitle us to. Should, therefore, excessive\r\nand continued injury compel at length a resort to the means\r\nof self-redress, we are strong in the consciousness that no wrong\r\ncommitted on our part, no precipitancy in repelling the wrongs\r\ncommitted by others, no want of moderation in our exactions of\r\nvoluntary justice, but undeniable aggressions on us, and the\r\navowed purpose of continuing them, will have produced a recurrence\r\nso little consonant with our principles or inclinations.\r\n\r\nTo carry with me into retirement the approbation and esteem\r\nof my fellow citizens, will, indeed, be the highest reward they\r\ncan confer on me, and certainly the only one I have ever desired.\r\nI invoke the favor of heaven, fellow citizens, towards yourselves\r\nand our beloved country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.\r\n\r\n                                                       August 2, 1808.\r\n\r\nIn the review, fellow citizens, which, in your address of the\r\n14th of June, you have taken of the measures pursued since I\r\nhave been charged with their direction, I read with great satisfaction\r\nand thankfulness, the approbation you have bestowed on\r\nthem; and I feel it an ample reward for any services I may have\r\nbeen able to render.\r\n\r\nThe present moment is certainly eventful, and one which\r\npeculiarly requires that the bond of confederation connecting us\r\nas a nation should receive all the strength which unanimity between\r\nthe national councils and the State legislatures can give it.\r\n\r\nThe depredations committed on our vessels and property on\r\nthe high seas, the violences to the persons of our citizens employed\r\non that element, had long been the subject of remonstrance\r\nand complaint, when, instead of reparation, new declarations\r\nof wrong are issued, subjecting our navigation to general\r\nplunder. In this state of things our first duty was to withdraw\r\nour sea-faring citizens and property from abroad, and to keep at\r\nhome resources so valuable at all times, and so essential, if resort\r\nmust ultimately be had to force.\r\n\r\nIt gave us time, too, to make a last appeal to the reason and\r\nreputation of nations. In the meanwhile I see with satisfaction\r\nthat this measure of self-denial is approved and supported by the\r\ngreat body of our real citizens; that they meet with cheerfulness\r\nthe temporary privations it occasions, and are preparing with\r\nspirit to provide for themselves those comforts and conveniences\r\nof life, for which it would be unwise evermore to recur to distant\r\ncountries. How long this course may be preferable to a\r\nmore serious appeal, must depend for decision on the wisdom of\r\nthe legislature; unless, indeed, a return to established principles\r\nshould remove the existing obstacles to a peaceable intercourse\r\nwith foreign nations. In every event, fellow citizens, my confidence\r\nis entire that your resolution to maintain our national independence\r\nand sovereignty will be as firm as it has been forbearing;\r\nand looking back on our history, I am assured by the\r\npast, that its future pages will present nothing unworthy of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nI am happy that you approve of the motives of my retirement.\r\nI shall carry into it ardent prayers for the welfare of my country,\r\nand the sincerest wishes for that of yourselves personally.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR LANGDON.\r\n\r\n                                                       August 2, 1808.\r\n\r\nI received in due time your favor of June 24th, covering the\r\naddress of the House of Representatives and Senate of New\r\nHampshire, and I ask leave, through the same channel, to return\r\nthe enclosed answer, to be communicated to them in whatever\r\nway you think most acceptable. Highly gratified by this approbation\r\nof the legislature of your State, as it respects myself personally,\r\nthe moment at which it is expressed gives it peculiar\r\nvalue as a public document. It is the testimony of a respectable\r\nlegislature in favor of a measure submitting our fellow citizens\r\nto some present sufferings to preserve them from future and\r\ngreater, and cannot fail to strengthen the disposition to maintain\r\nit which I am happy to perceive is so general. I tender you\r\nmy affectionate salutations, and with every wish for your health\r\nand happiness, the assurance of my high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR LANGDON. (PRIVATE.)\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, August 2, 1808.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--The enclosed are formal, and for the public;\r\nbut in sending them to you I cannot omit the occasion of indulging\r\nmy friendship in a more familiar way, and of recalling\r\nmyself to your recollection. How much have I wished to have\r\nhad you still with us through the years of my employment at\r\nWashington. I have seen with great pleasure the moderation\r\nand circumspection with which you have been kind enough to\r\nact under my letter of May 6th, and I have been highly gratified\r\nwith the late general expressions of public sentiment in favor of\r\na measure which alone could have saved us from immediate war,\r\nand give time to call home eighty millions of property, twenty\r\nor thirty thousand seamen, and two thousand vessels. These\r\nare now nearly at home, and furnish a great capital, much of\r\nwhich will go into manufactures and seamen to man a fleet of\r\nprivateers, whenever our citizens shall prefer war to a longer continuance\r\nof the embargo. Perhaps, however, the whale of the\r\nocean may be tired of the solitude it has made on that element,\r\nand return to honest principles, and his brother robber on the\r\nland may see that, as to us, the grapes are sour. I think one war\r\nenough for the life of one man; and you and I have gone through\r\none which at least may lessen our impatience to embark in\r\nanother. Still, if it becomes necessary, we must meet it like\r\nmen, old men indeed, but yet good for something. But whether\r\nin peace or war, may you have as many years of life as you\r\ndesire, with health and prosperity to make them happy years. I\r\nsalute you with constant affection and great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE JOSEPH ALSTON, SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF\r\nREPRESENTATIVES OF SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, August 4, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your letter of July 6th, covering\r\nthe resolutions of the legislature of South Carolina of June 29th,\r\nand I see in those resolutions a new manifestation of the national\r\nspirit of which South Carolina has given so many proofs. It is\r\nthe more exemplary, as it is certain that no State sacrifices more\r\nby the operation of a measure which, whether to avoid war, or\r\nto prepare for it, has been deemed equally necessary. The\r\nunanimity too of these resolutions, does peculiar honor to those\r\nindividuals, who differing from the mass of their fellow citizens\r\nin their opinions of government, yet forget all differences when\r\nthe rights of their country are in question; who when it is assailed\r\nby foreign wrong, and menaced with the evils of war, instead\r\nof encouraging enemies by forebodings of weakness and\r\ndivision, present to them one common and undivided front.\r\nPersuaded that the sentiments expressed in these resolutions are\r\na true specimen of those entertained by the great mass of our\r\nfellow citizens, we may regret the evils which a contrary opinion\r\nin others may produce, but we cannot fear the result of any\r\ntrial they may put us to.\r\n\r\nI receive with particular gratification assurances of approbation\r\nfrom the legislature of South Carolina, and will not cease in my\r\nendeavors to merit a continuance of it. I pray you to accept\r\nmy salutations and assurances of great respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE INHABITANTS OF THE TOWN OF BOSTON, NEWBURYPORT AND\r\nPROVIDENCE, IN LEGAL TOWN MEETING ASSEMBLED.\r\n\r\n                                                      August 26, 1808.\r\n\r\nYour representation and request were received on the 22d inst.,\r\nand have been considered with the attention due to every expression\r\nof the sentiments and feelings of so respectable a body\r\nof my fellow citizens. No person has seen, with more concern\r\nthan myself, the inconveniences brought on our country in general\r\nby the circumstances of the times in which we happen to\r\nlive; times to which the history of nations presents no parallel.\r\nFor years we have been looking as spectators on our brethren of\r\nEurope, afflicted by all those evils which necessarily follow an\r\nabandonment of the moral rules which bind men and nations together.\r\nConnected with them in friendship and commerce, we\r\nhave happily so far kept aloof from their calamitous conflicts, by\r\na steady observance of justice towards all, by much forbearance\r\nand multiplied sacrifices. At length, however, all regard to the\r\nrights of others having been thrown aside, the belligerent powers\r\nhave beset the highway of commercial intercourse with edicts\r\nwhich, taken together, expose our commerce and mariners, under\r\nalmost every destination, a prey to their fleets and armies.\r\nEach party, indeed, would admit our commerce with themselves,\r\nwith the view of associating us in their war against the other.\r\nBut we have wished war with neither. Under these circumstances\r\nwere passed the laws of which you complain, by those\r\ndelegated to exercise the powers of legislation for you, with every\r\nsympathy of a common interest in exercising them faithfully.\r\nIn reviewing these measures, therefore, we should advert to the\r\ndifficulties out of which a choice was of necessity to be made.\r\nTo have submitted our rightful commerce to prohibitions and\r\ntributary exactions from others, would have been to surrender\r\nour independence. To resist them by arms was war, without\r\nconsulting the state of things or the choice of the nation. The\r\nalternative preferred by the legislature of suspending a commerce\r\nplaced under such unexampled difficulties, besides saving to our\r\ncitizens their property, and our mariners to their country, has the\r\npeculiar advantage of giving time to the belligerent nations to\r\nrevise a conduct as contrary to their interests as it is to our\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n\"In the event of such peace, or suspension of hostilities between\r\nthe belligerent powers of Europe, or of such change in\r\ntheir measures affecting neutral commerce, as may render that\r\nof the United States sufficiently safe, in the judgment of the\r\nPresident,\" he is authorized to suspend the embargo. But no\r\npeace or suspension of hostilities, no change of measures affecting\r\nneutral commerce, is known to have taken place. The orders\r\nof England, and the decrees of France and Spain, existing\r\nat the date of these laws, are still unrepealed, as far as we know.\r\nIn Spain, indeed, a contest for the government appears to have\r\narisen; but of its course or prospects we have no information on\r\nwhich prudence would undertake a hasty change in our policy,\r\neven were the authority of the Executive competent to such a\r\ndecision.\r\n\r\nYou desire that, in this defect of power, Congress may be specially\r\nconvened. It is unnecessary to examine the evidence or\r\nthe character of the facts which are supposed to dictate such a\r\ncall; because you will be sensible, on an attention to dates, that\r\nthe legal period of their meeting is as early as, in this extensive\r\ncountry, they could be fully convened by a special call.\r\n\r\nI should, with great willingness, have executed the wishes of\r\nthe inhabitants of the town of Boston, Newburyport, and Providence,\r\nhad peace, or a repeal of the obnoxious edicts, or other\r\ncharges, produced the case in which alone the laws have given\r\nme that authority; and so many motives of justice and interest\r\nlead to such changes, that we ought continually to expect them.\r\nBut while these edicts remain, the legislature alone can prescribe\r\nthe course to be pursued.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A PORTION OF THE CITIZENS OF BOSTON.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received the address of that portion of the\r\ncitizens of [Boston] who have declared their approbation of the\r\npresent suspension of our commerce, and their dissent from the\r\nrepresentation of those of the same place, who wished its removal.\r\nA division of sentiment was not unexpected. On no\r\nquestion can a perfect unanimity be hoped, or certainly it would\r\nhave been on that between war and embargo, the only alternatives\r\npresented to our choice. For the general capture of our\r\nvessels would have been war on one side, which reason and interest\r\nwould repel by war and reprisal on our part.\r\n\r\nOf the several interests composing those of the United States,\r\nthat of manufactures would of course prefer to war a state of\r\nnon-intercourse, so favorable to their rapid growth and prosperity.\r\nAgriculture, although sensibly feeling the loss of market for its produce,\r\nwould find many aggravations in a state of war. Commerce and navigation,\r\nor that portion which is foreign, in the inactivity to which they are\r\nreduced by the present state of things, certainly experience their full\r\nshare in the general inconvenience; but whether war would to them be\r\na preferable alternative, is a question their patriotism would never\r\nhastily propose. It is to be regretted, however, that overlooking the\r\nreal sources of their sufferings, the British and French edicts, which\r\nconstitute the actual blockade of our foreign commerce and navigation,\r\nthey have, with too little reflection, imputed them to laws which have\r\nsaved them from greater, and have preserved for our own use our vessels,\r\nproperty and seamen, instead of adding them to the strength of those\r\nwith whom we might eventually have to contend.\r\n\r\nThe embargo, giving time to the belligerent powers to revise\r\ntheir unjust proceedings, and to listen to the dictates of justice,\r\nof interest and reputation, which equally urge the correction of\r\ntheir wrongs, has availed our country of the only honorable expedient\r\nfor avoiding war; and should a repeal of these edicts\r\nsupersede the cause for it, our commercial brethren will become\r\nsensible that it has consulted their interests, however against\r\ntheir own will. It will be unfortunate for their country if, in\r\nthe meantime, these their expressions of impatience should have\r\nthe effect of prolonging the very sufferings which have produced\r\nthem, by exciting a fallacious hope that we may, under any\r\npressure, relinquish our equal right of navigating the ocean, go\r\nto such ports only as others may prescribe, and there pay the\r\ntributary exactions they may impose; an abandonment of national\r\nindependence and of essential rights, revolting to every\r\nmanly sentiment. While these edicts are in force, no American\r\ncan ever consent to a return of peaceable intercourse with those\r\nwho maintain them.\r\n\r\nI am happy, in the approach of the period when the feelings\r\nand the wisdom of the nation will be collected in their representatives\r\nassembled together. To them are committed our rights,\r\nto them our wrongs are known, and they will pronounce the\r\nremedy they call for; and I hear with pleasure from all, as well\r\nthose who approve, as who disapprove of the present measures,\r\nassurances of an implicit acquiescence in their enunciation of the\r\ngeneral will.\r\n\r\nI beg leave through you to communicate this answer to the\r\naddress on which your signature held the first place, and to add\r\nthe assurances of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMBERS OF THE BALTIMORE BAPTIST ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n                                                     October 17, 1808.\r\n\r\nI receive with great pleasure the friendly address of the Baltimore\r\nBaptist Association, and am sensible how much I am indebted\r\nto the kind dispositions which dictated it.\r\n\r\nIn our early struggles for liberty, religious freedom could not\r\nfail to become a primary object. All men felt the right, and a\r\njust animation to obtain it was exhibited by all. I was one\r\nonly among the many who befriended its establishment, and am\r\nentitled but in common with others to a portion of that approbation\r\nwhich follows the fulfilment of a duty.\r\n\r\nExcited by wrongs to reject a foreign government which directed\r\nour concerns according to its own interests, and not to\r\nours, the principles which justified us were obvious to all understandings,\r\nthey were imprinted in the breast of every human\r\nbeing; and Providence ever pleases to direct the issue of our\r\ncontest in favor of that side where justice was. Since this happy\r\nseparation, our nation has wisely avoided entangling itself in the\r\nsystem of European interests, has taken no side between its rival\r\npowers, attached itself to none of its ever-changing confederacies.\r\nTheir peace is desirable; and you do me justice in saying that to\r\npreserve and secure this, has been the constant aim of my administration.\r\nThe difficulties which involve it, however, are\r\nnow at their ultimate term, and what will be their issue, time\r\nalone will disclose. But be it what it may, a recollection of\r\nour former vassalage in religion and civil government, will unite\r\nthe zeal of every heart, and the energy of every hand, to preserve\r\nthat independence in both which, under the favor of heaven, a\r\ndisinterested devotion to the public cause first achieved, and a\r\ndisinterested sacrifice of private interests will now maintain.\r\n\r\nI am happy in your approbation of my reasons for determining\r\nto retire from a station, in which the favor of my fellow citizens\r\nhas so long continued and supported me: I return your kind\r\nprayers with supplications to the same almighty Being for your\r\nfuture welfare and that of our beloved country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMBERS OF THE KETOCTON BAPTIST ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\n                                                     October 18, 1808.\r\n\r\nI received with great pleasure the affectionate address of the\r\nKetocton Baptist Association, and am sensible how much I am\r\nindebted to the kind dispositions which dictated it.\r\n\r\nIn our early struggles for liberty, religious freedom could not\r\nfail to become a primary object. All men felt the right, and a\r\njust animation to obtain it was excited in all. And although\r\nyour favor selected me as the organ of your petition to abolish the\r\nreligious denomination of a privileged church, yet I was but one\r\nof the many who befriended its object, and am entitled but in\r\ncommon with them to a portion of that approbation which follows\r\nthe fulfilment of a duty.\r\n\r\nThe views you express of the conduct of the belligerent powers\r\nare as correct as they are afflicting to the lovers of justice and\r\nhumanity. Those moral principles and conventional usages\r\nwhich have heretofore been the bond of civilized nations, which\r\nhave so often preserved their peace by furnishing common rules\r\nfor the measure of their rights, have now given way to force, the\r\nlaw of Barbarians, and the nineteenth century dawns with the\r\nVandalism of the fifth. Nothing has been spared on our part to\r\npreserve the peace of our country, during this distempered state of\r\nthe world. But the difficulties which involve it are now at their\r\nultimate term, and what will be their issue, time alone will disclose.\r\nBut be that what it may, a recollection of our former\r\nvassalage in religion and civil government will unite the zeal of\r\nevery heart, and the energy of every hand, to preserve that independence\r\nin both, which, under the favor of heaven, a disinterested\r\ndevotion to the public cause first achieved, and a disinterested\r\nsacrifice of private interests will now maintain.\r\n\r\nI am happy in your approbation of my reasons for determining\r\nto retire from a station in which the favor of my fellow citizens\r\nhas so long continued and supported me; and I return your kind\r\nprayers by supplications to the same Almighty being for your\r\nfuture welfare, and that of our beloved country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GENERAL MEETING OF CORRESPONDENCE OF THE SIX BAPTIST\r\nASSOCIATIONS REPRESENTED AT CHESTERFIELD, VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n                                                    November 21, 1808.\r\n\r\nThank you, fellow citizens, for your affectionate address, and\r\nI receive with satisfaction your approbation of my motives for retirement.\r\nIn reviewing the history of the times through which\r\nwe have past, no portion of it gives greater satisfaction, on reflection,\r\nthan that which presents the efforts of the friends of religious\r\nfreedom, and the success with which they were crowned.\r\nWe have solved by fair experiment, the great and interesting\r\nquestion whether freedom of religion is compatible with order in\r\ngovernment, and obedience to the laws. And we have experienced\r\nthe quiet as well as the comfort which results from leaving\r\nevery one to profess freely and openly those principles of religion\r\nwhich are the inductions of his own reason, and the serious\r\nconvictions of his own inquiries.\r\n\r\nIt is a source of great contentment to me to learn that the\r\nmeasures which have been pursued in the administration of your\r\naffairs have met your approbation. Too often we have had but a\r\nchoice among difficulties; and this situation characterizes remarkably\r\nthe present moment. But, fellow citizens, if we are\r\nfaithful to our country, if we acquiesce, with good will, in the\r\ndecisions of the majority, and the nation moves in mass in the\r\nsame direction, although it may not be that which every individual\r\nthinks best, we have nothing to fear from any quarter.\r\n\r\nI thank you sincerely for your kind wishes for my welfare,\r\nand with equal sincerity implore the favor of a protecting Providence\r\nfor yourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TABER FITCH, ESQ., CHAIRMAN.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, November 21, 1808.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have received with great pleasure the address of the\r\nrepublicans of the State of Connecticut, and am particularly sensible\r\nof the kindness with which they have viewed my conduct\r\nin the direction of their affairs. Having myself highly approved\r\nthe example of an illustrious predecessor, in voluntarily retiring\r\nfrom a trust, which, if too long continued in the same hands,\r\nmight become a subject of reasonable uneasiness and apprehension,\r\nI could not mistake my own duty when placed in a similar\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nOur experience so far, has satisfactorily manifested the competence\r\nof a republican government to maintain and promote the\r\nbest interests of its citizens; and every future year, I doubt not,\r\nwill contribute to settle a question on which reason, and a knowledge\r\nof the character and circumstances of our fellow citizens,\r\ncould never admit a doubt, and much less condemn them as fit\r\nsubjects to be consigned to the dominion of wealth and force.\r\nAlthough under the pressure of serious evils at this moment, the\r\ngovernments of the other hemisphere cannot boast a more favorable\r\nsituation. We certainly do not wish to exchange our difficulties\r\nfor the sanguinary distresses of our fellow men beyond\r\nthe water. In a state of the world unparalleled in times past,\r\nand never again to be expected, according to human probabilities,\r\nno form of government has, so far, better shielded its citizens\r\nfrom the prevailing afflictions. By withdrawing awhile\r\nfrom the ocean we have suffered some loss; but we have gathered\r\nhome our immense capital. Exposed to foreign depredation, we\r\nhave saved our seamen from the jails of Europe, and gained time\r\nto prepare for the defence of our country. The questions of submission,\r\nof war, or embargo, are now before our country as unembarrassed\r\nas at first. Submission and tribute, if that be our\r\nchoice, will be no baser now than at the date of the embargo.\r\nBut if, as I trust, that idea be spurned, we may now decide on\r\nthe other alternatives of war and embargo, with the advantage\r\nof possessing all the means which have been rescued from the\r\ngrasp of capture. These advantages certainly justify the approbation\r\nof the embargo declared in your address, and I have no\r\ndoubt will ensure that of every candid citizen, who will correctly\r\ntrace the consequences of any other course.\r\n\r\nI thank you for the kind concern you are pleased to express\r\nfor my future happiness, and offer my sincere prayers for your\r\nwelfare and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE YOUNG REPUBLICANS OF PITTSBURG AND ITS VICINITIES.\r\n\r\n                                                     December 2, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments which you express in your address of October\r\n27th, of attachment to the rights of your country, of your determination\r\nto support them with your lives and fortunes, and of\r\ndisregard of the inconveniences which must be encountered in\r\nresisting insult and aggression, are honorable to yourselves, and\r\nencouraging to your country. They are particularly solacing to\r\nthose who, having labored faithfully in establishing the right of\r\nself-government, see in the rising generation, into whose hands\r\nit is passing, that purity of principle, and energy of character,\r\nwhich will protect and preserve it through their day, and deliver\r\nit over to their sons as they receive it from their fathers. The\r\nmeasure of a temporary suspension of commerce was adopted\r\nto cover us from greater evils. It has rescued from capture an\r\nimportant capital, and our seamen from the jails of Europe. It\r\nhas given time to prepare for defence, and has shown to the aggressors\r\nof Europe that evil, as well as good actions, recoil on\r\nthe doers. If these evils have involved our inoffending neighbors\r\nalso, towards whom we have not a sentiment but of friendship\r\nand useful intercourse, it results from that state of violence\r\nby which the interests of the American hemisphere are directed\r\nto the objects of Europe. Endowed by nature with a system of\r\ninterests and connections of its own, it is drawn from these by\r\nthe unnatural bonds which enchain its different parts to the conflicting\r\ninterests and fortunes of another world, and render its inhabitants\r\nstrangers and enemies, to their neighbors and mutual\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the happiness of mankind is best promoted by\r\nthe useful pursuits of peace, that on these alone a stable prosperity\r\ncan be founded, that the evils of war are great in their\r\nendurance, and have a long reckoning for ages to come, I have\r\nused my best endeavors to keep our country uncommitted in the\r\ntroubles which afflict Europe, and which assail us on every side.\r\nWhether this can be done longer, is to be doubted. I am happy\r\nthat so far my conduct meets the approbation of my fellow citizens.\r\nIt is the highest reward I can receive for my endeavors to\r\nserve them; and I am particularly thankful to yourselves for the\r\nkind expressions of esteem and confidence, and tender my best\r\nwishes for your personal happiness and prosperity.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SOCIETY OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH AT\r\nPITTSBURG, PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n                                         WASHINGTON, December 9, 1808.\r\n\r\nI am much indebted, fellow citizens, for your friendly address\r\nof November 20th, and gratified by its expressions of personal\r\nregard to myself. Having ever been an advocate for the freedom\r\nof religious opinion and exercise, from no person, certainly, was\r\nan abridgment of these sacred rights to be apprehended less than\r\nfrom myself.\r\n\r\nIn justice, too, to our excellent constitution, it ought to be observed,\r\nthat it has not placed our religious rights under the\r\npower of any public functionary. The power, therefore, was\r\nwanting, not less than the will, to injure these rights.\r\n\r\nThe times in which we live, fellow citizens, are indeed times\r\nof trouble, such as no age has yet seen, or perhaps will ever see\r\nagain. To avoid their calamitous influence, has been our duty\r\nand endeavor, and to effect it, great sacrifices of our citizens have\r\nbeen necessary. They have seen that these necessities were\r\nforced by the wrongs of others, and they have met them with\r\nthe zeal which the crisis called for. What course we are finally\r\nto take, cannot yet be foreseen; but reading, reflecting, and examining\r\nfor yourselves, you will find your public functionaries,\r\naccording to the best of their judgments, directing your affairs,\r\nwithout passion or partiality, with a single view to your rights\r\nand best interests. And it is the approbation of those who so\r\nread, reflect, and examine for themselves, which is so truly consoling\r\nto the persons charged with the guidance of your affairs.\r\nFor that portion of your approbation which you are pleased to\r\nbestow on my conduct, I am truly thankful, and I offer my sincere\r\nprayers for your welfare, and a happy issue of our country\r\nfrom the difficulties impending over it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ELECTORS OF THE COUNTY OF ONTARIO, IN THE STATE OF\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\n                                                    December 13, 1808.\r\n\r\nThe wrongs which we have sustained, fellow citizens, from\r\nthe belligerent powers of Europe, and of which you have taken\r\nso just a view in your address, received by me on the 27th of\r\nthe last month, could not fail to excite in the bosoms of freemen\r\nthe sentiments of high indignation expressed by you. The love\r\nof peace had long induced us to bear with these aggressions,\r\nand the hope of a return to a spirit of justice had encouraged us\r\nto persevere in endeavors at amicable adjustment. Their outrages,\r\nhowever, have at length forced us to suspend all intercourse with\r\nthem, to gather home our resources, and to prepare for whatever\r\nmay happen. Your approbation of these measures is gratifying\r\nto your public functionaries, and the readiness you express to\r\nencounter the privations and sacrifices which these aggressions\r\noccasion, is honorable to yourselves. The legislature of the\r\nnation now assembled together, will decide how long the state\r\nof non-intercourse may be preferable to a more serious appeal.\r\nThe decided support which you tender either of the present, or\r\nsuch other measures as they shall adopt for the good of the\r\nUnion, and the pledge of your lives, your fortunes and honor for\r\nthat purpose, are calculated to inspire them with firmness in their\r\ndeliberations, and an assurance that the result will be supported\r\nby their country. The confidence you are so good as to express\r\nin the conduct of the administration, is highly gratifying to\r\nthem, and encourages a perseverance in their best endeavors for\r\nthe public good. That these may issue in effecting your happiness,\r\nand the peace and prosperity of our country, is my sincere\r\nprayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CITIZENS OF THE CITY AND COUNTY OF PHILADELPHIA IN\r\nTOWN-MEETING ASSEMBLED.\r\n\r\n                                                     February 3, 1809.\r\n\r\nIn the resolutions and address which you have been pleased\r\nto present to me, I recognize with great satisfaction the sentiments\r\nof faithful citizens, devoted to the maintenance of the\r\nrights of their country, to the sacred bond which unites these\r\nStates together, and rallying round their government in support of\r\nits laws. After the intolerable assault on our maritime rights, by\r\nthe declarations of the belligerent powers, that we should navigate\r\nthe ocean only as they should permit, the recall of our seamen,\r\nrecovery of our property abroad, and putting ourselves into a state\r\nof defence, should perseverance on their parts force us to the\r\nlast appeal, were duties to first obligation. No other course was\r\nleft us but to reduce our navigation within the limits they dictated,\r\nand to hold even that subject to such further restrictions\r\nas their interests or will should prescribe. To this no friend to\r\nthe independence of his country should submit.\r\n\r\nYour resolution to aid in bringing to justice all violators of the\r\nlaws of their country, and particularly of the embargo laws, and\r\nto be ready at all times to assist in carrying them into effect, is\r\nworthy of the patriotism which distinguishes the city and county\r\nof Philadelphia. This voluntary support of laws, formed by\r\npersons of our own choice, distinguishes peculiarly the minds\r\ncapable of self-government. The contrary spirit is anarchy,\r\nwhich of necessity produces despotism. It is from the supporters\r\nof regular government only that the pledge of life, fortune, and\r\nhonor is worthy of confidence.\r\n\r\nI learn with great satisfaction your approbation of the several\r\nmeasures passed by the government, and enumerated in your address.\r\nFor the advantages flowing from them you are indebted\r\nprincipally to a wise and patriotic legislature, and to the able and\r\ninestimable coadjutors with whom it has been my good fortune\r\nto be associated in the direction of your affairs. That these\r\nmeasures may be productive of the ends intended, must be the\r\nwish of every friend of his country; and the belief that everything\r\nhas been done to preserve our peace, secure the rights of\r\nour fellow citizens, and to promote their best interests, will be a\r\nconsolation under every situation to which the great disposer of\r\nevents may destine us.\r\n\r\nYour approbation of the motives for my retirement from the\r\nstation so long confided to me, is a confirmation of their correctness.\r\nIn no office can rotation be more expedient; and none\r\nless admits the indulgence of age. I am peculiarly sensible of\r\nyour kind wishes for my happiness in the tranquillity of retirement.\r\nNothing will contribute more to it than the hope of\r\ncarrying with me the approbation of my fellow citizens, of the\r\nendeavors which I have faithfully exerted to be useful to them.\r\nTo the all-protecting favor of heaven I commit yourselves and\r\nour common country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF GEORGIA.\r\n\r\n                                                     February 3, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe address which the Legislature of Georgia, the immediate\r\norgan of the will of their constituents, has been pleased to present\r\nto me, is received with that high satisfaction which the approbation\r\nof so respectable a State is calculated to inspire. During the\r\nunexampled contest which has so long afflicted Europe, which\r\nhas prostrated all the laws which have hitherto been deemed\r\nsacred among nations, and have so long constituted the rule of\r\ntheir intercourse, we had vainly hoped that our distance from\r\nthe scene of carnage, and the invariable justice with which we\r\nhave conducted ourselves towards all parties, would shield us\r\nfrom its baleful effects. But that commerce indispensably necessary\r\nfor the exchange of the produce of this great agricultural\r\ncountry for the things which we want, increased by a temporary\r\nsuccession to the commerce of other nations, as being ourselves\r\nthe only neutrals, has brought us into contact with the lawless\r\nbelligerents in every sea, and threatens to involve us in the vortex\r\nof their contests. The privations for the want of a vent for\r\nour produce, have been the unavoidable result of the edicts of the\r\nbelligerent powers. Should the measure adopted in consequence\r\nof them, and which meets your approbation, still save the lives\r\nand property of our brethren from the insults and rapacity of\r\nthese powers, it will be a fortunate addition to the other benefits\r\nderived from it. On the other hand, should our present embarrassments\r\neventuate in war, I am satisfied that the State of Georgia\r\nwill zealously emulate her sister States in supporting the\r\ngovernment of their choice, and in maintaining the rights and\r\ninterests of the nation. Our soil, our industry, and our numbers,\r\nwith the bravery which will be engaged in the cause, can never\r\nleave us without resources to maintain such a contest.\r\n\r\nTo no events which can concern the future welfare of my\r\ncountry, can I ever become an indifferent spectator; her prosperity\r\nwill be my joy, her calamities my affliction.\r\n\r\nThankful for the indulgence with which my conduct has been\r\nviewed by the Legislature of Georgia, and for the kind expressions\r\nof their good will, I supplicate the favor of heaven towards\r\nthem and our beloved country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SOCIETY OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL CHURCH AT NEW\r\nLONDON, CONNECTICUT.\r\n\r\n                                                     February 4, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe approbation you are so good as to express of the measures\r\nwhich have been recommended and pursued during the\r\ncourse of my administration of the national concerns, is highly\r\nacceptable. The approving voice of our fellow citizens, for endeavors\r\nto be useful, is the greatest of all earthly rewards.\r\n\r\nNo provision in our constitution ought to be dearer to man\r\nthan that which protects the rights of conscience against the\r\nenterprises of the civil authority. It has not left the religion of\r\nits citizens under the power of its public functionaries, were it\r\npossible that any of these should consider a conquest over the\r\nconsciences of men either attainable or applicable to any desirable\r\npurpose. To me no information could be more welcome\r\nthan that the minutes of the several religious societies should\r\nprove, of late, larger additions than have been usual, to their\r\nseveral associations, and I trust that the whole course of my\r\nlife has proved me a sincere friend to religious as well as civil\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your affectionate good wishes for my future\r\nhappiness. Retirement has become essential to it; and one of\r\nits best consolations will be to witness the advancement of my\r\ncountry in all those pursuits and acquisitions which constitute\r\nthe character of a wise and virtuous nation; and I offer sincere\r\nprayers to heaven that its benediction may attend yourselves,\r\nour country and all its sons.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n                                                    February 16, 1809.\r\n\r\nI receive with peculiar sensibility the affectionate address of\r\nthe General Assembly of my native State, on my approaching\r\nretirement from the office with which I have been honored by\r\nthe nation at large. Having been one of those who entered\r\ninto public life at the commencement of an æra the most extraordinary\r\nwhich the history of man has ever yet presented to his\r\ncontemplation, I claim nothing more, for the part I have acted in\r\nit, than a common merit of having, with others, faithfully endeavored\r\nto do my duty in the several stations allotted me. In\r\nthe measures which you are pleased particularly to approve, I\r\nhave been aided by the wisdom and patriotism of the national\r\nlegislature, and the talents and virtues of the able coadjutors with\r\nwhom it has been my happiness to be associated, and to whose\r\nvaluable and faithful services I with pleasure and gratitude bear\r\nwitness.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment that to preserve our rights a change of government\r\nbecame necessary, no doubt could be entertained that a\r\nrepublican form was most consonant with reason, with right, with\r\nthe freedom of man, and with the character and situation of our\r\nfellow citizens. To the sincere spirit of republicanism are\r\nnaturally associated the love of country, devotion to its liberty,\r\nits rights, and its honor. Our preference to that form of government\r\nhas been so far justified by its success, and the prosperity\r\nwith which it has blessed us. In no portion of the earth were\r\nlife, liberty and property ever so securely held; and it is with infinite\r\nsatisfaction that withdrawing from the active scenes of\r\nlife, I see the sacred design of these blessings committed to those\r\nwho are sensible of their value and determined to defend them.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a great consolation to have left the nation\r\nunder the assurance of continued peace. Nothing has been\r\nspared to effect it; and at no other period of history would such\r\nefforts have failed to ensure it. For neither belligerent pretends\r\nto have been injured by us, or can say that we have in any instance\r\ndeparted from the most faithful neutrality; and certainly\r\nnone will charge us with a want of forbearance.\r\n\r\nIn the desire of peace, but in full confidence of safety from\r\nour unity, our position, and our resources, I shall retire into the\r\nbosom of my native State, endeared to me by every tie which\r\ncan attach the human heart. The assurances of your approbation,\r\nand that my conduct has given satisfaction to my fellow\r\ncitizens generally, will be an important ingredient in my future\r\nhappiness; and that the supreme ruler of the universe may have\r\nour country under his special care, will be among the latest of\r\nmy prayers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CITIZENS OF WILMINGTON AND ITS VICINITY IN TOWN\r\nMEETING ASSEMBLED.\r\n\r\n                                                    February 16, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions which have been entered into by the citizens\r\nof Wilmington and its vicinity, are worthy of the well-known\r\npatriotism of that place.\r\n\r\nThe storm which with little intermission has been raging for\r\nso many years, which has immolated the ancient dynasties and\r\ninstitutions of Europe, and prostrated the principles of public\r\nlaw heretofore respected, has hitherto been felt but in a secondary\r\ndegree by us. But threatening at length to involve us in its\r\nvortex, it is time for all good citizens to rally round the constituted\r\nauthorities by a public expression of their determination to\r\nsupport the laws and government of their choice, and to frown\r\ninto silence all disorganizing movements. Strong in our numbers,\r\nour position and resources, we can never be endangered but\r\nby schisms at home. It has been the anxious care of the government\r\nto preserve the United States from this destructive contest;\r\nbut whether it can yet be done depends on a return to reason\r\nby those who have so long rejected its dictates. On our part,\r\nthere is no doubt of a continuance of the same desire to conduct\r\nthe nation quietly through the political storms prevailing, and to\r\nlead it in safety through the perils with which we are menaced\r\nby the ambition of foreign nations.\r\n\r\nI am thankful for the great indulgence with which you have\r\nviewed the measures of my administration. Of their wisdom\r\nothers must judge; but I may truly say they have been pursued\r\nwith honest intentions, unbiassed by any personal or interested\r\nviews. It is a consolation to know that the motives for my retirement\r\nare approved; and although I withdraw from public\r\nfunctions, I shall continue an anxious spectator of passing events,\r\nand offer to heaven my constant prayers for the preservation of\r\nour republic, and especially of those its best principles which secure\r\nto all its citizens a perfect equality of rights.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN GASSAWAY, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, February 17, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received the resolutions of the republican\r\ncitizens of Annapolis and Anne-Arundel county, of the 4th inst.,\r\nwhich you were so kind as to forward to me.\r\n\r\nThat the aggressions and injuries of the belligerent nations\r\nhave been the real obstructions which have interrupted our commerce,\r\nand now threaten our peace, and that the embargo laws\r\nwere salutary and indispensably necessary to meet those obstructions,\r\nare truths as evident to every candid man, as it is worthy\r\nof every good citizen to declare his reprobation of that system\r\nof opposition which goes to an avowed and practical resistance\r\nof these laws. To such a resistance I trust that the patriotism\r\nof our faithful citizens in no section of the Union will give any\r\ncountenance. Where the law of majority ceases to be acknowledged,\r\nthere government ends, the law of the strongest takes its\r\nplace, and life and property are his who can take them.\r\n\r\nI receive with particular pleasure and thankfulness the testimony\r\nof the republican citizens of Annapolis and Anne-Arundel,\r\nin favor of the course of proceedings during my administration\r\nof the public affairs. And I can truly say, in their words, that\r\nthey have been conducted with the purest regard and devotion\r\nto the interests of the people and the national safety and honor;\r\nand I pray you, with my acknowledgments for these favorable\r\nsentiments, to accept the assurances of my high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN JOSEPH ----, JR.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, February 17, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The resolutions entered into at a meeting of the officers\r\nof the Legionary Brigade of the 1st Division of Massachusetts\r\nmilitia, on the 31st ult., which you have been pleased to forward\r\nto me, breathe that spirit of fidelity to our common country\r\nwhich must ever be peculiarly the spirit of its militia, and which\r\nrenders that the safest and last reliance of a republican nation.\r\nThe perils with which we have been for some time environed,\r\nhave been such as ought to have induced every faithful citizen\r\nto unite in support of the rights of his country, laying aside little\r\ndifferences, political or personal, till they might be indulged without\r\nhazarding the safety of our country. Assailed in our essential\r\nrights by two of the most powerful nations on the globe, we\r\nhave remonstrated, negotiated, and at length retired to the last\r\nstand, in the hope of peaceably preserving our rights. In this\r\nextremity I have entire confidence that no part of _the people_ in\r\nany section of the Union, will desert the banners of their country,\r\nand co-operate with the enemies who are threatening its existence.\r\nThe subscribing officers of the legionary brigade have\r\nfurnished an honorable example of declaring their attachment to\r\nthe constitution, the laws, and the union of the States, that they\r\nwill at the call of law, rally around the standard of their country,\r\nand protect its constitution, laws, right and liberties, against all\r\nfoes. I thank them, in the name of their country, for these patriotic\r\nresolutions, the pledge of support they tender will lead\r\nthem to no more than the honor of a soldier and fidelity of a citizen\r\nwould of itself require. I salute yourself and the subscribing\r\noffices with esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REPUBLICAN YOUNG MEN OF NEW LONDON, BENJAMIN\r\nHEMPSTEAD CHAIRMAN.\r\n\r\n                                                    February 24, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe approbation which you are pleased to express of my past\r\nadministration, is highly gratifying to me. That in a free government\r\nthere should be differences of opinion as to public measures\r\nand the conduct of those who direct them, is to be expected.\r\nIt is much, however, to be lamented, that these differences should\r\nbe indulged at a crisis which calls for the undivided councils\r\nand energies of our country, and in a form calculated to encourage\r\nour enemies in the refusal of justice, and to force their country\r\ninto war as the only resource for obtaining it.\r\n\r\nYou do justice to the government in believing that their utmost\r\nendeavors have been used to steer us clear of wars with\r\nother nations, and honor to yourselves in declaring that if these\r\nendeavors prove ineffectual, and your country is called upon to\r\ndefend its rights and injured honor by an appeal to arms, you\r\nwill be ready for the contest, and will meet our enemies at the\r\nthreshold of our country. While prudence will endeavor to\r\navoid this issue, bravery will prepare to meet it.\r\n\r\nI thank you, fellow citizens, for your kind expressions of\r\nregard for myself, and prayers for my future happiness, and I\r\njoin in supplications to that Almighty Being who has heretofore\r\nguarded our councils, still to continue his gracious benedictions\r\ntowards our country, and that yourselves may be under the protection\r\nof his divine favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REPUBLICANS OF LOUDON COUNTY, CONVENED AT LEESBURG,\r\nFEBRUARY, 13, 1809.\r\n\r\n                                                    February 24, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe measures lately pursued in preference either to war or an\r\nignominious surrender of our rights as an independent people,\r\nhave undoubtedly produced the beneficial effects of saving our\r\nproperty and seamen, of lengthening the term of our peace, and\r\nof giving time for defensive preparations. Other efficacious results\r\nwould probably have been produced, in a much higher degree,\r\nhad not the measures been counteracted by unworthy\r\npassions. It is still possible that the blessings of peace may be\r\ncontinued to us, should sounder calculations of interest induce a\r\nreturn to justice by the aggressive nations. But should we be\r\ndisappointed in what ought to be so justly expected, the solemn\r\npledge of life and fortune in vindication of our violated rights\r\nreceived from yourselves as well as from other citizens, leaves\r\nus without apprehension as to the issue of any contest into\r\nwhich we may be forced.\r\n\r\nI thank you particularly for the approbation you manifest of\r\nmy conduct and motives, and the kind concern you express for\r\nmy future happiness, and I beg leave to tender you my best\r\nwishes and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR TOMPKINS.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, February 24, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received, a few days ago, your Excellency's favor of\r\nthe 9th inst., covering the patriotic resolutions of the Legislature\r\nof New York, of the 3d. The times do certainly render it incumbent\r\non all good citizens, attached to the rights and honor\r\nof their country, to bury in oblivion all internal differences, and\r\nrally around the standard of their country in opposition to the\r\noutrages of foreign nations. All attempts to enfeeble and destroy\r\nthe exertions of the General Government, in vindication of our\r\nnational rights, or to loosen the bands of union by alienating the\r\naffections of the people, or opposing the authority of the laws at\r\nso eventful a period, merit the discountenance of all.\r\n\r\nThe confidence which the Legislature expresses in the national\r\nadministration is highly consolatory, and their determination\r\nto support the just rights of their country with their lives and\r\nfortunes, are worthy of the high character of the State of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nBy all, I trust, the union of these States will ever be considered\r\nas the Palladium of their safety, their prosperity and glory,\r\nand all attempts to sever it will be frowned on with reprobation\r\nand abhorrence. And I have equal confidence, that all moved\r\nby the sacred principles of liberty and patriotism will prepare\r\nthemselves for any crisis we may be able to meet, and will be\r\nready to co-operate with each other, and with the constituted\r\nauthorities, in resisting and repelling the aggressions of foreign\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature may be assured that every exertion will be\r\nused to put the United States in the best condition of defence,\r\nthat we may be fully prepared to meet the dangers which menace\r\nthe peace of our country. I avail myself with pleasure of\r\nevery occasion to tender to your Excellency the assurances of\r\nmy high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL JAMES ROBERTSON.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, February 24, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your letter covering the resolutions\r\nof the citizens of West Tennessee, assembled in the town of\r\nNashville. Every friend of his country must feel the regret and\r\nindignation they so laudably express at the unjust and unprecedented\r\nmeasures adopted by the belligerent powers of Europe,\r\nviolating our maritime rights as a free and independent nation,\r\nand compelling us for their preservation to resort to measures\r\nthe effects of which we must all feel. And all must see with\r\npleasure their honorable declaration against receding from the\r\ngrounds taken with regard to the belligerent nations, and their\r\nreprobation of the surrender of any essential points in difference\r\nbetween us and those nations.\r\n\r\nShould the embargo be continued, or a non-intercourse be\r\nsubstituted, it is pleasing to know that our fellow citizens will\r\nafford every aid in their power to render it effectual; and if war\r\nmust at length be resorted to, I have entire confidence in their\r\ndeclarations, that as citizen soldiers they will be ready at the\r\ncall of their country to prove to their enemies that they know\r\nhow to value and defend their rights.\r\n\r\nI am happy to learn their approbation of the measures adopted\r\nby the General Government in relation to Great Britain and\r\nFrance, and particularly thankful for the satisfaction they express\r\nwith the course I have pursued in the discharge of the arduous\r\nduties which devolved on me as chief magistrate of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept for yourself and them the assurances of\r\nmy great respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REPUBLICANS OF THE COUNTY OF NIAGARA, CONVENED\r\nAT CLARENCE ON THE 26TH OF JANUARY, 1809.\r\n\r\n                                                    February 24, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe eventful crisis in our national affairs so truly portrayed in\r\nyour very friendly address, has justly excited your serious attention.\r\nThe nations of the earth prostrated at the foot of power,\r\nthe ocean submitted to the despotism of a single nation, the laws\r\nof nature and the usages which have hitherto regulated the intercourse\r\nof nations and interposed some restraint between power\r\nand right, now totally disregarded. Such is the state of things\r\nwhen the United States are left single-handed to maintain the\r\nrights of neutrals, and the principles of public right against a\r\nwarring world. Under these circumstances, it is a great consolation\r\nto receive the assurances of our faithful citizens that they\r\nwill unite their destiny with their government, will rally under\r\nthe banners of their country, and with their lives and fortunes,\r\ndefend and support their civil and religious rights. This declaration,\r\ntoo, is the more honorable from those whose frontier residence\r\nwill expose them particularly to the inroads of a foe.\r\n\r\nI receive with great pleasure your approbation of the impartial\r\nneutrality we have so invariably pursued, and of the trying\r\nmeasure of embargo rendered necessary by the belligerent edicts,\r\nwhich has saved our seamen and our property, has given us time\r\nto prepare for vindicating our honor and preserving our national\r\nindependence, and has excited the spirit of manufacturing for\r\nourselves those things which, though we raised the raw material,\r\nwe have hitherto sought from other countries at the risk\r\nof war and rapine.\r\n\r\nI thank you for your kind wishes for my future happiness in\r\nretiring from public life to the bosom of my family. Nothing\r\nwill contribute more to it than the assurance that my fellow\r\ncitizens approve of my endeavors to serve them, and the hope\r\nthat we shall be continued in the blessings we have enjoyed\r\nunder the favor of Heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN QUIN MORTON.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, February 24, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor tendering the service\r\nof fifty citizens of Tennessee as a company of volunteer riflemen.\r\nThere are two acts of Congress which regulate the acceptances\r\nof these tenders; that of the last year (1808) is for a\r\nservice of six months, and authorizes the governors to accept;\r\nand that of 1807, for a service of twelve months, authorizing the\r\nPresident to accept, who has delegated that power to the governors\r\nof the several States. Under whichever of these, therefore,\r\nyour tender was meant to be made, I must pray you to repeat\r\nit to the governor of the State; expressing, at the same time,\r\nmy great satisfaction at the readiness and patriotism with which\r\nI see my fellow citizens resort to the standard of their country\r\nwhen danger threatens it. Accept for your company my thanks\r\non the public behalf, and for yourself the assurances of my respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE TAMMANY SOCIETY OR COLUMBIAN ORDER OF THE CITY OF\r\nWASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                        March 2, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe observations are but too just which are made in your\r\nfriendly address, on the origin and progress of those abuses of\r\npublic confidence and power which have so often terminated in\r\na suppression of the rights of the people, and the mere aggrandizement\r\nand emolument of their oppressors. Taught by these\r\ntruths, and aware of the tendency of power to degenerate into\r\nabuse, the worthies of our own country have secured its independence\r\nby the establishment of a constitution and form of\r\ngovernment for our nation, calculated to prevent as well as to\r\ncorrect abuse.\r\n\r\nBeyond the great water the torch of discord has been long\r\nlighted up, and long and unremitting have been the endeavors\r\nof the belligerents to immerge us in the evils they were inflicting\r\non each other, and to make us parties in their quarrels. Whether\r\nit will be possible much longer to escape these evils, is difficult\r\nto decide; but you do me justice in believing that no efforts on\r\nmy part have been spared to effect this purpose, and to preserve\r\nfor our nation the blessings of peace.\r\n\r\nI learn with sincere pleasure that the measures I have pursued\r\nin directing the affairs of our nation have met with approbation.\r\nTheir sole object has certainly been the good of my fellow citizens,\r\nwhich sometimes may have been mistaken, but never intentionally\r\ndisregarded. This approbation is the more valued\r\nas being the spontaneous effusion of the feelings of those who\r\nhave lived in the same city with myself, and having examined\r\ncarefully and even jealously my conduct through every passing\r\nday, bear testimony to their belief in its fidelity.\r\n\r\nI am happy, in my retirement, to carry with me your esteem\r\nand your prayers for my health, peace and happiness; and I sincerely\r\nsupplicate Heaven that your own personal welfare may\r\nlong make a part of the general prosperity of a great, a free, and\r\na happy people.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CITIZENS OF WASHINGTON.\r\n\r\n                                                        March 4, 1809.\r\n\r\nI received with peculiar gratification the affectionate address\r\nof the citizens of Washington, and in the patriotic sentiments it\r\nexpresses, I see the true character of the national metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe station which we occupy among the nations of the earth\r\nis honorable, but awful. Trusted with the destinies of this solitary\r\nrepublic of the world, the only monument of human rights,\r\nand the sole depository of the sacred fire of freedom and self-government,\r\nfrom hence it is to be lighted up in other regions\r\nof the earth, if other regions of the earth shall ever become susceptible\r\nof its benign influence. All mankind ought then, with\r\nus, to rejoice in its prosperous, and sympathize in its adverse fortunes,\r\nas involving everything dear to man. And to what sacrifices\r\nof interest, or convenience, ought not these considerations\r\nto animate us? To what compromises of opinion and inclination,\r\nto maintain harmony and union among ourselves, and to\r\npreserve from all danger this hallowed ark of human hope and\r\nhappiness. That differences of opinion should arise among men,\r\non politics, on religion, and on every other topic of human inquiry,\r\nand that these should be freely expressed in a country where all\r\nour faculties are free, is to be expected. But these valuable\r\nprivileges are much prevented when permitted to disturb the\r\nharmony of social intercourse, and to lesson the tolerance of\r\nopinion. To the honor of society here, it has been characterized\r\nby a just and generous liberality, and an indulgence of those\r\naffections which, without regard to political creeds, constitute\r\nthe happiness of life. That the improvement of this city must\r\nproceed with sure and steady steps, follows from its many obvious\r\nadvantages, and from the enterprizing spirit of its inhabitants,\r\nwhich promises to render it the fairest seat of wealth and\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nIt is very gratifying to me that the general course of my administration\r\nis approved by my fellow citizens, and particularly\r\nthat the motives of my retirement are satisfactory. I part with\r\nthe powers entrusted to me by my country, as with a burthen\r\nof heavy bearing; but it is with sincere regret that I part with\r\nthe society in which I have lived here. It has been the source\r\nof much happiness to me during my residence at the seat of\r\ngovernment, and I owe it much for its kind dispositions. I\r\nshall ever feel a high interest in the prosperity of the city, and\r\nan affectionate attachment to its inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REPUBLICANS OF GEORGETOWN.\r\n\r\n                                                        March 8, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe affectionate address of the republicans of Georgetown on\r\nmy retirement from public duty, is received with sincere pleasure.\r\nIn the review of my political life, which they so indulgently\r\ntake, if it be found that I have done my duty as other\r\nfaithful citizens have done, it is all the merit I claim. Our lot\r\nhas been cast on an awful period of human history. The contest\r\nwhich began with us, which ushered in the dawn of our\r\nnational existence and led us through various and trying scenes,\r\nwas for everything dear to free-born man. The principles on\r\nwhich we engaged, of which the charter of our independence\r\nis the record, were sanctioned by the laws of our being, and we\r\nbut obeyed them in pursuing undeviatingly the course they\r\ncalled for. It issued finally in that inestimable state of freedom\r\nwhich alone can ensure to man the enjoyment of his equal rights.\r\nFrom the moment which scaled our peace and independence,\r\nour nation has wisely pursued the paths of peace and justice.\r\nDuring the period in which I have been charged with its concerns,\r\nno effort has been spared to exempt us from the wrongs\r\nand the rapacity of foreign nations, and with you I feel assured\r\nthat no American will hesitate to rally round the standard of his\r\ninsulted country, in defence of that freedom and independence\r\nachieved by the wisdom of sages, and consecrated by the blood\r\nof heroes.\r\n\r\nThe favorable testimony of those among whom I have lived,\r\nand lived happily as a fellow citizen, as a neighbor, and in the\r\nvarious relations of social life, will enliven the days of my retirement,\r\nand be felt and cherished with affection and gratitude.\r\n\r\nI thank you, fellow citizens, for your kind prayers for my future\r\nhappiness. I shall ever retain a lively sense of your friendly\r\nattentions, and continue to pray for your prosperity and well\r\nbeing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STEPHEN CROSS, ESQ., TOPSHAM.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, March 28, 1809.\r\n\r\nTo the delegates from the various towns in the county of\r\nEssex and commonwealth of Massachusetts, assembled on the\r\n20th of February, at Topsham.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of your kind address in the last moments of the\r\nsession of Congress, will, I trust, offer a just apology for this late\r\nacknowledgment of it. I am very sensible of the indulgence\r\nwith which you are so good as to review the measures of my\r\nlate administration, and I feel for that indulgence the sentiments\r\nof gratitude it so justly calls for. The stand which has been\r\nmade on behalf of our seamen enslaved and incarcerated in\r\nforeign ships, and against the prostration of our rights on the\r\nocean under laws of nature acknowledged by all civilized nations,\r\nwas an effort due to the protection of our commerce, and\r\nto that portion of our fellow citizens engaged in the pursuits of\r\nnavigation. The opposition of the same portion to the vindication\r\nof their peculiar rights, has been as wonderful as the loyalty\r\nof their agricultural brethren in the assertion of them has been\r\ndisinterested and meritorious. If the honor of the nation can\r\nbe forgotten, whether the abandonment of the right of navigating\r\nthe ocean may not be compensated by exemption from the\r\nwars it would produce, may be a question for our future councils,\r\nwhich the disclaimer of our navigating citizens may, if continued,\r\nrelieve from the embarrassment of their rights.\r\n\r\nSincerely and affectionately attached to our national constitution,\r\nas the ark of our safety, and grand palladium of our peace\r\nand happiness, I learn with pleasure that the number of those in\r\nthe county of Essex, who read and think for themselves, is\r\ngreat, and constituted of men who will never surrender but with\r\ntheir lives, the invaluable liberties achieved by their fathers.\r\nTheir elevated minds put all to the hazard for a three penny\r\nduty on tea, by the same nation which now exacts a tribute\r\nequal to the value of half our exported produce.\r\n\r\nI thank you, fellow citizens, for the kind interest you take in\r\nmy future happiness, and I sincerely supplicate that overruling\r\nprovidence which governs the destinies of men and nations, to\r\ndispense his choicest blessings on yourselves and our beloved\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REPUBLICAN MECHANICS OF THE TOWN OF LEESBURG AND\r\nITS VICINITY, ASSEMBLED ON THE 27TH OF FEBRUARY LAST.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, March 29, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of your kind address in the last moments of the\r\nsession of Congress, will, I trust, offer a just apology for its late\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\nYour friendly salutations on the close of my public life, and\r\napprobation of the motives which dictated my retirement, are received\r\nwith great satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThat there should be a contrariety of opinions respecting the\r\npublic agents and their measures, and more especially respecting\r\nthat which recently suspended our commerce and produced temporary\r\nprivations, is ever to be expected among free men; and I\r\nam happy to find you are in the number of those who are satisfied\r\nthat the course pursued was marked out by our country's\r\ninterest, and called for by her dearest rights. While the principles\r\nof our constitution give just latitude to inquiry, every citizen\r\nfaithful to it will, with you, deem embodied expressions of\r\ndiscontent, and open outrages of law and patriotism, as dishonorable\r\nas they are injurious; and there is reason to believe\r\nthat had the efforts of the government against the innovations\r\nand tyranny of the belligerent powers been unopposed among\r\nourselves, they would have been more effectual towards the establishment\r\nof our rights.\r\n\r\nUnconscious of partiality between the different callings of my\r\nfellow citizens, I trust that a fair review of my attention to the\r\ninterests of commerce in particular, in every station of my political\r\nlife, will afford sufficient proofs of my just estimation of\r\nits importance in the social system. What has produced our\r\npresent difficulties, and what will have produced the impending\r\nwar, if that is to be our lot? Our efforts to save the rights of\r\ncommerce and navigation. From these, solely and exclusively,\r\nthe whole of our present dangers flow.\r\n\r\nWith just reprobations of the resistance made or menaced\r\nagainst the laws of our country, I applaud your patriotic resolution\r\nto meet hostility to them with the energy and dignity of\r\nfreemen; and thankful for your solicitude for my health and\r\nhappiness, I salute you with affectionate sentiments of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE FRIENDS OF THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nIN BRISTOL COUNTY, RHODE ISLAND.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, March 20, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe receipt of your friendly address in the last moments of the\r\nsession of Congress, will, I trust, offer a just apology for its late\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\nWe have certainly cause to rejoice that since the waves of affliction\r\nand peril, raised from the storm of war by the rival belligerents\r\nof Europe, have undulated on our shores, the councils\r\nof the nation have been able to preserve it from the numerous\r\nevils which have awfully menaced, and otherwise might have\r\nfallen upon us. How long we may yet retain this desirable position\r\nis difficult to be foreseen. But confident I am that as long\r\nas it can be done consistently with the honor and interest of our\r\ncountry, it will be maintained by those to whom you have confided\r\nthe helm of government. A surer pledge for this cannot\r\nbe found than in the public and private virtues of the successor\r\nto the chair of government, which you so justly recognize. Your\r\nreflections are certainly correct on the importance of a good administration\r\nin a republican government, towards securing to us\r\nour dearest rights, and the practical enjoinment of all our liberties;\r\nand such an one can never fail to give consolation to the\r\nfriends of free government, and mortification to its enemies. In\r\nretiring from the duties of my late station, I have the consolation\r\nof knowing that such is the character of those into whose hands\r\nthey are transferred, and of a conviction that all will be done for\r\nus which wisdom and virtue can do.\r\n\r\nI thank you, fellow citizens, for the kind sentiments of your\r\naddress, and am particularly gratified by your approbation of the\r\ncourse I have pursued; and I pray heaven to keep you under its\r\nholy favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLICAN DELEGATES FROM THE TOWNSHIPS OF WASHINGTON\r\nCOUNTY, IN PENNSYLVANIA, CONVENED ON THE 21ST OF FEBRUARY, 1809.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, March 31, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe satisfaction you express, fellow citizens, that my endeavors\r\nhave been unremitting to preserve the peace and independence\r\nof our country, and that a faithful neutrality has been observed\r\ntowards all the contending powers, is highly grateful to\r\nme; and there can be no doubt that in any common times they\r\nwould have saved us from the present embarrassments, thrown in\r\nthe way of our national prosperity by the rival powers.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the embargo laws have not had all the effect in\r\nbringing the powers of Europe to a sense of justice, which a\r\nmore faithful observance of them might have produced. Yet\r\nthey have had the important effects of saving our seamen and\r\nproperty, of giving time to prepare for defence; and they will\r\nproduce the further inestimable advantage of turning the attention\r\nand enterprise of our fellow citizens, and the patronage of\r\nour State legislatures, to the establishment of useful manufactures\r\nin our country. They will have hastened the day when an\r\nequilibrium between the occupations of agriculture, manufactures,\r\nand commerce, shall simplify our foreign concerns to the exchange\r\nonly of that surplus which we cannot consume for those\r\narticles of reasonable comfort or convenience which we cannot\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nOur lot has been cast, by the favor of heaven, in a country\r\nand under circumstances, highly auspicious to our peace and\r\nprosperity, and where no pretence can arise for the degrading\r\nand oppressive establishments of Europe. It is our happiness\r\nthat honorable distinctions flow only from public approbation;\r\nand that finds no object in titled dignitaries and pageants. Let\r\nus then, fellow citizens, endeavor carefully to guard this happy\r\nstate of things, by keeping a watchful eye over the disaffection\r\nof wealth and ambition to the republican principles of our constitution,\r\nand by sacrificing all our local and personal interests to\r\nthe cultivation of the Union, and maintenance of the authority\r\nof the laws.\r\n\r\nMy warmest thanks are due to you, fellow citizens, for the affectionate\r\nsentiments expressed in your address, and my prayers\r\nwill ever be offered for your welfare and happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CITIZENS OF ALLEGHANY COUNTY, IN MARYLAND.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, March 31, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe sentiments of attachment, respect, and esteem, expressed\r\nin your address of the 20th ult., have been read with pleasure,\r\nand would sooner have received my thanks, but for the mass of\r\nbusiness engrossing the last moments of a session of Congress. I\r\nam gratified by your approbation of our efforts for the general\r\ngood, and our endeavors to promote the best interests of our\r\ncountry, and to place them on a basis firm and lasting. The\r\nmeasures respecting our intercourse with foreign nations were the\r\nresult, as you suppose, of a choice between two evils, either to\r\ncall and keep at home our seamen and property, or suffer them\r\nto be taken under the edicts of the belligerent powers. How a\r\ndifference of opinion could arise between these alternatives is\r\nstill difficult to explain on any acknowledged ground; and I am\r\npersuaded, with you, that when the storm and agitation characterizing\r\nthe present moment shall have subsided, when passion\r\nand prejudice shall have yielded to reason its usurped place, and\r\nespecially when posterity shall pass its sentence on the present\r\ntimes, justice will be rendered to the course which has been pursued.\r\nTo the advantages derived from the choice which was\r\nmade will be added the improvements and discoveries made and\r\nmaking in the arts, and the establishments in domestic manufacture,\r\nthe effects whereof will be permanent and diffused through\r\nour wide-extended continent. That we may live to behold the\r\nstorm which seems to threaten us, pass like a summer's cloud\r\naway, and that yourselves may continue to enjoy all the blessings\r\nof peace and prosperity, is my fervent prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REPUBLICAN CITIZENS OF WASHINGTON COUNTY, MARYLAND,\r\nASSEMBLED AT HAGERSTOWN ON THE 6TH INSTANT.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, March 31, 1809.\r\n\r\nThe affectionate sentiments you express on my retirement\r\nfrom the high office conferred upon me by my country, are\r\ngratefully received and acknowledged with thankfulness. Your\r\napprobation of the various measures which have been pursued,\r\ncannot but be highly consolatory to myself, and encouraging to\r\nfuture functionaries, who will see that their honest endeavors for\r\nthe public good will receive due credit with their constituents.\r\nThat the great and leading measure respecting our foreign intercourse\r\nwas the most salutary alternative, and preferable to the\r\nsubmission of our rights as a free and independent republic, or to\r\na war at that period, cannot be doubted by candid minds. Great\r\nand good effects have certainly flowed from it, and greater would\r\nhave been produced, had they not been, in some degree, frustrated\r\nby unfaithful citizens.\r\n\r\nIf, in my retirement to the humble station of a private citizen,\r\nI am accompanied with the esteem and approbation of my fellow\r\ncitizens, trophies obtained by the blood-stained steel, or the tattered\r\nflags of the tented field, will never be envied. The care\r\nof human life and happiness, and not their destruction, is the\r\nfirst and only legitimate object of good government.\r\n\r\nI salute you, fellow citizens, with every wish for your welfare,\r\nand the perpetual duration of our government, in all the purity\r\nof its republican principles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES HOCHIE, ESQ., PRESIDENT OF THE ANCIENT PLYMOUTH\r\nSOCIETY OF NEW LONDON.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, April 2, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received your favor of March 17th, covering\r\nresolutions of the Ancient Plymouth Society of New London,\r\napproving my conduct, as well during the period of my late administration,\r\nas the preceding portion of my public services.\r\n\r\nOur lot has been cast in times which called for the best exertions\r\nof all our citizens to recover and preserve the rights which\r\nnature had given them; and we may say with truth, that the\r\nmass of our fellow citizens have performed with zeal and effect\r\nthe duties called for. If I have been fortunate enough to give\r\nsatisfaction in the performance of those allotted to me by our\r\ncountry, I find an ample reward in the assurances of that satisfaction.\r\nPossessed of the blessing of self-government, and of\r\nsuch a portion of civil liberty as no other civilized nation enjoys,\r\nit now behooves us to guard and preserve them by a continuance\r\nof the sacrifices and exertions by which they were acquired, and\r\nespecially to nourish that union which is their sole guarantee.\r\nI pray you to accept for yourself and your associates the assurances\r\nof my high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HIS EXCELLENCY GOVERNOR WRIGHT.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, April 3, 1809.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your friendly note of March 3d, was delivered\r\nto me on that day. You know the pressure of the last moments\r\nof a session of Congress, and can judge of that of my own departure\r\nfrom Washington, and of my first attentions here. This\r\nmust excuse my late acknowledgment of your note. The assurances\r\nof your approbation of the course I have observed are\r\nhighly flattering, and the more so, as you have been sometimes\r\nan eye-witness and long of the vicinage of the public councils.\r\nThe testimony of my fellow citizens, and especially of one who,\r\nhaving been himself in the high departments, to the means of\r\ninformation united the qualifications to judge, is a consolation\r\nwhich will sweeten the residue of my life. The fog which arose\r\nin the east in the last moments of my service, will doubtless clear\r\naway and expose under a stronger light the rocks and shoals\r\nwhich have threatened us with danger. It is impossible the\r\ngood citizens of the east should not see the agency of England,\r\nthe tools she employs among them, and the criminal arts and\r\nfalsehoods of which they have been the dupes. I still trust and\r\npray that our union may be perpetual, and I beg you to accept\r\nthe assurances of my high esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, April 12, 1809.\r\n\r\nI receive with respect and gratitude, from the Legislature of\r\nNew York, on my retirement from the office of chief magistrate\r\nof the United States, the assurances of their esteem, and of their\r\nsatisfaction with the services I have endeavored to render. The\r\nwelfare of my fellow citizens, and the perpetuation of our republican\r\ninstitutions, having been the governing principles of my\r\npublic life, the favorable testimony borne by the Legislature of a\r\nState so respectable as that of New York, gives me the highest\r\nconsolation. And this is much strengthened by an intimate conviction\r\nthat the same principles will govern the conduct of my\r\nsuccessor, whose talents, and eminent services, are a certain\r\npledge that the confidence in him expressed by the Legislature\r\nof New York, will never be disappointed.\r\n\r\nSole depositories of the remains of human liberty, our duty to\r\nourselves, to posterity, and to mankind, call on us by every motive\r\nwhich is sacred or honorable, to watch over the safety of\r\nour beloved country during the troubles which agitate and convulse\r\nthe residue of the world, and to sacrifice to that all personal\r\nand local considerations. While the boasted energies of monarchy\r\nhave yielded to easy conquest the people they were to\r\nprotect, should our fabric of freedom suffer no more than the\r\nslight agitations we have experienced, it will be an useful lesson\r\nto the friends as well as the enemies of self-government. That\r\nit may stand the shocks of time and accident, and that your own\r\nmay make a distinguished part of the mass of prosperity it may\r\ndispense, will be my latest prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REPUBLICANS OF QUEEN ANNE'S COUNTY.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, April 13, 1809.\r\n\r\nI have received, fellow citizens, your farewell address, with\r\nthose sentiments of respect and satisfaction which its very friendly\r\nterms are calculated to inspire. With the consciousness of having\r\nendeavored to serve my fellow citizens according to their\r\nbest interests, these testimonies of their good will are the sole\r\nand highest remuneration my heart has ever desired.\r\n\r\nI am sensible of the indulgence with which you review the\r\nmeasures which have been pursued; and approving our sincere\r\nendeavors to observe a strict neutrality with respect to foreign\r\npowers. It is with reason you observe that, if hostilities must\r\nsucceed, we shall have the consolation that justice will be on\r\nour side. War has been avoided from a due sense of the miseries,\r\nand the demoralization it produces, and of the superior\r\nblessings of a state of peace and friendship with all mankind.\r\nBut peace on our part, and war from others, would neither be\r\nfor our happiness or honor; and should the lawless violences of\r\nthe belligerent powers render it necessary to return their hostilities,\r\nno nation has less to fear from a foreign enemy.\r\n\r\nI thank you, fellow citizens, for your very kind wishes for my\r\nhappiness, and pray you to accept the assurances of my cordial\r\nesteem, and grateful sense of your favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MEMBERS OF THE BAPTIST CHURCH OF BUCK MOUNTAIN IN\r\nALBEMARLE.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, April 13, 1809.\r\n\r\nI thank you, my friends and neighbors, for your kind congratulations\r\non my return to my native home, and on the opportunities\r\nit will give me of enjoying, amidst your affections,\r\nthe comforts of retirement and rest. Your approbation of my\r\nconduct is the more valued as you have best known me, and is\r\nan ample reward for any services I may have rendered. We\r\nhave acted together from the origin to the end of a memorable\r\nrevolution, and we have contributed, each in the line allotted us,\r\nour endeavors to render its issue a permanent blessing to our\r\ncountry. That our social intercourse may, to the evening of\r\nour days, be cheered and cemented by witnessing the freedom\r\nand happiness for which we have labored, will be my constant\r\nprayer. Accept the offering of my affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JONATHAN LOW, ESQ., HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT.\r\n\r\n                                           MONTICELLO, April 13, 1809.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received on the 6th instant your favor covering the\r\nresolutions of the general meeting of the republicans of the State\r\nof Connecticut who had been convened at Hartford; and I see\r\nwith pleasure the spirit they breathe. They express with truth\r\nthe wrongs we have sustained, the forbearance we have exercised,\r\nand the duty of rallying round the constituted authorities,\r\nfor the protection of our Union. Surrounded by such difficulties\r\nand dangers, it is really deplorable that any should be found\r\namong ourselves vindicating the conduct of the aggressors; co-operating\r\nwith them in multiplying embarrassments to their own\r\ncountry, and encouraging disobedience to the laws provided for\r\nits safety. But a spirit which should go further, and countenance\r\nthe advocates for a dissolution of the Union, and for setting in\r\nhostile array one portion of our citizens against another, would\r\nrequire to be viewed under a more serious aspect. It would\r\nprove indeed that it is high time for every friend to his country,\r\nin a firm and decided manner, to express his sentiments of the\r\nmeasures which government has adopted to avert the impending\r\nevils, unhesitatingly to pledge himself for the support of the laws,\r\nliberties and independence of his country; and, with the general\r\nmeeting of the republicans of Connecticut, to resolve that, for\r\nthe preservation of the Union, the support and enforcement of\r\nthe laws, and for the resistance and repulsion of every enemy,\r\nthey will hold themselves in readiness, and put at stake, if necessary,\r\ntheir lives and fortunes, on the pledge of their sacred honor.\r\n\r\nWith my thanks for the mark of attention in making this\r\ncommunication, I pray you to accept for yourself and my respectable\r\nfellow citizens from whom it proceeds, the assurance\r\nof my high consideration, and my prayers for their welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE TAMMANY SOCIETY OF THE CITY OF BALTIMORE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, May 25, 1809.\r\n\r\nYour free and cordial salutations in my retirement are received,\r\nfellow citizens, with great pleasure, and the happiness of that retirement\r\nis much heightened by assurances of satisfaction with\r\nthe course I have pursued in the transaction of the public affairs,\r\nand that the confidence my fellow citizens were pleased to repose\r\nin me, has not been disappointed.\r\n\r\nGreat sacrifices of interest have certainly been made by our\r\nnation under the difficulties latterly forced upon us by transatlantic\r\npowers. But every candid and reflecting mind must agree\r\nwith you, that while these were temporary and bloodless, they\r\nwere calculated to avoid permanent subjection to foreign law and\r\ntribute, relinquishment of independent rights, and the burthens,\r\nthe havoc, and desolations of war. That these will be ultimately\r\navoided, we have now some reason to hope; and the successful\r\nexample of recalling nations to the practice of justice by\r\npeaceable appeals to their interests, will doubtless have salutary\r\neffects on our future course. As a countervail, too, to our short-lived\r\nsacrifices, when these shall no longer be felt, we shall permanently\r\nretain the benefit they have prompted, of fabricating\r\nfor our own use the materials of our own growth, heretofore\r\ncarried to the work-houses of Europe, to be wrought and returned\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nThe hope you express that my successor will continue in the\r\nsame system of measures, is guaranteed, as far as future circumstances\r\nwill permit, by his enlightened and zealous participation\r\nin them heretofore, and by the happy pacification he is now effecting\r\nfor us. Your wishes for my future happiness are very\r\nthankfully felt, and returned by the sincerest desires that yourselves\r\nmay experience the favors of the great dispenser of all\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nINDIAN ADDRESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n                                           CHARLOTTESVILLE, June 1781.\r\n\r\n_To Brother John Baptist de Coigne_:--\r\n\r\nBROTHER JOHN BAPTIST DE COIGNE,--I am very much pleased\r\nwith the visit you have made us, and particularly that it has\r\nhappened when the wise men from all parts of our country were\r\nassembled together in council, and had an opportunity of hearing\r\nthe friendly discourse you held to me. We are all sensible of\r\nyour friendship, and of the services you have rendered, and I\r\nnow, for my countrymen, return you thanks, and, most particularly,\r\nfor your assistance to the garrison which was besieged by\r\nthe hostile Indians. I hope it will please the great being above\r\nto continue you long in life, in health and in friendship to us;\r\nand that your son will afterwards succeed you in wisdom, in\r\ngood disposition, and in power over your people. I consider the\r\nname you have given as particularly honorable to me, but I value\r\nit the more as it proves your attachment to my country. We,\r\nlike you, are Americans, born in the same land, and having the\r\nsame interests. I have carefully attended to the figures represented\r\non the skins, and to their explanation, and shall always\r\nkeep them hanging on the walls in remembrance of you and\r\nyour nation. I have joined with you sincerely in smoking the\r\npipe of peace; it is a good old custom handed down by your ancestors,\r\nand as such I respect and join in it with reverence. I\r\nhope we shall long continue to smoke in friendship together.\r\nYou find us, brother, engaged in war with a powerful nation.\r\nOur forefathers were Englishmen, inhabitants of a little island\r\nbeyond the great water, and, being distressed for land, they came\r\nand settled here. As long as we were young and weak, the\r\nEnglish whom we had left behind, made us carry all our wealth\r\nto their country, to enrich them; and, not satisfied with this,\r\nthey at length began to say we were their slaves, and should do\r\nwhatever they ordered us. We were now grown up and felt ourselves\r\nstrong, we knew we were free as they were, that we came\r\nhere of our own accord and not at their biddance, and were\r\ndetermined to be free as long as we should exist. For this\r\nreason they made war on us. They have now waged that war\r\nsix years, and have not yet won more land from us than will\r\nserve to bury the warriors they have lost. Your old father,\r\nthe king of France, has joined us in the war, and done many\r\ngood things for us. We are bound forever to love him, and\r\nwish you to love him, brother, because he is a good and true\r\nfriend to us. The Spaniards have also joined us, and other\r\npowerful nations are now entering into the war to punish the\r\nrobberies and violences the English have committed on them.\r\nThe English stand alone, without a friend to support them, hated\r\nby all mankind because they are proud and unjust. This quarrel,\r\nwhen it first began, was a family quarrel between us and the\r\nEnglish, who were then our brothers. We, therefore, did not\r\nwish you to engage in it at all. We are strong enough of ourselves\r\nwithout wasting your blood in fighting our battles. The\r\nEnglish, knowing this, have been always suing to the Indians to\r\nhelp them fight. We do not wish you to take up the hatchet.\r\nWe love and esteem you. We wish you to multiply and be\r\nstrong. The English, on the other hand, wish to set you and\r\nus to cutting one another's throats, that when we are dead they\r\nmay take all our land. It is better for you not to join in this\r\nquarrel, unless the English have killed any of your warriors or\r\ndone you any other injury. If they have, you have a right to\r\ngo to war with them, and revenge the injury, and we have none\r\nto restrain you. Any free nation has a right to punish those who\r\nhave done them an injury. I say the same, brother, as to the\r\nIndians who treat you ill. While I advise you, like an affectionate\r\nfriend, to avoid unnecessary war, I do not assume the\r\nright of restraining you from punishing your enemies. If the\r\nEnglish have injured you, as they have injured the French and\r\nSpaniards, do like them and join us in the war. General Clarke\r\nwill receive you and show you the way to their towns. But if\r\nthey have not injured you, it is better for you to lie still and be\r\nquiet. This is the advice which has been always given by the\r\ngreat council of the Americans. We must give the same, because\r\nwe are but one of thirteen nations, who have agreed to\r\nact and speak together. These nations keep a council of wise\r\nmen always sitting together, and each of us separately follow\r\ntheir advice. They have the care of all the people and the\r\nlands between the Ohio and Mississippi, and will see that no\r\nwrong be committed on them. The French settled at Kaskaskias,\r\nSt. Vincennes, and the Cohos, are subject to that council,\r\nand they will punish them if they do you any injury. If you\r\nwill make known to me any just cause of complaint against\r\nthem, I will represent it to the great council at Philadelphia, and\r\nhave justice done you.\r\n\r\nOur good friend, your father, the King of France, does not lay\r\nany claim to them. Their misconduct should not be imputed to\r\nhim. He gave them up to the English the last war, and we\r\nhave taken them from the English. The Americans alone have\r\na right to maintain justice in all the lands on this side the\r\nMississippi,--on the other side the Spaniards rule. You complain,\r\nbrother, of the want of goods for the use of your people. We\r\nknow that your wants are great, notwithstanding we have done\r\neverything in our power to supply them, and have often grieved\r\nfor you. The path from hence to Kaskaskias is long and dangerous;\r\ngoods cannot be carried to you in that way. New Orleans\r\nhas been the only place from which we could get goods\r\nfor you. We have bought a great deal there; but I am afraid\r\nnot so much of them have come to you as we intended. Some\r\nof them have been sold of necessity to buy provisions for our\r\nposts. Some have been embezzled by our own drunken and\r\nroguish people. Some have been taken by the Indians and\r\nmany by the English.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniards, having now taken all the English posts on the\r\nMississippi, have opened that channel free for our commerce,\r\nand we are in hopes of getting goods for you from them. I will\r\nnot boast to you, brother, as the English do, nor promise more\r\nthan we shall be able to fulfil. I will tell you honestly, what\r\nindeed your own good sense will tell you, that a nation at war\r\ncannot buy so many goods as when in peace. We do not make\r\nso many things to send over the great waters to buy goods, as\r\nwe made and shall make again in time of peace. When we buy\r\nthose goods, the English take many of them, as they are coming\r\nto us over the great water. What we get in safe, are to be divided\r\namong many, because we have a great many soldiers,\r\nwhom we must clothe. The remainder we send to our brothers\r\nthe Indians, and in going, a great deal of it is stolen or lost.\r\nThese are the plain reasons why you cannot get so much from\r\nus in war as in peace. But peace is not far off. The English\r\ncannot hold out long, because all the world is against them.\r\nWhen that takes place, brother, there will not be an Englishman\r\nleft on this side the great water. What will those foolish nations\r\nthen do, who have made us their enemies, sided with the English,\r\nand laughed at you for not being as wicked as themselves?\r\nThey are clothed for a day, and will be naked forever after;\r\nwhile you, who have submitted to short inconvenience, will be\r\nwell supplied through the rest of your lives. Their friends will\r\nbe gone and their enemies left behind; but your friends will be\r\nhere, and will make you strong against all your enemies. For\r\nthe present you shall have a share of what little goods we can\r\nget. We will order some immediately up the Mississippi for\r\nyou and for us. If they be little, you will submit to suffer a\r\nlittle as your brothers do for a short time. And when we shall\r\nhave beaten our enemies and forced them to make peace, we\r\nwill share more plentifully. General Clarke will furnish you\r\nwith ammunition to serve till we can get some from New Orleans.\r\nI must recommend to you particular attention to him. He is\r\nour great, good, and trusty warrior; and we have put everything\r\nunder his care beyond the Alleghanies. He will advise you in\r\nall difficulties, and redress your wrongs. Do what he tells you,\r\nand you will be sure to do right. You ask us to send schoolmasters\r\nto educate your son and the sons of your people. We\r\ndesire above all things, brother, to instruct you in whatever we\r\nknow ourselves. We wish to learn you all our arts and to make\r\nyou wise and wealthy. As soon as there is peace we shall be\r\nable to send you the best of schoolmasters; but while the war is\r\nraging, I am afraid it will not be practicable. It shall be done,\r\nhowever, before your son is of an age to receive instruction.\r\n\r\nThis, brother, is what I had to say to you. Repeat it from\r\nme to all your people, and to our friends, the Kickapous, Piorias,\r\nPiankeshaws and Wyattanons. I will give you a commission\r\nto show them how much we esteem you. Hold fast the chain\r\nof friendship which binds us together, keep it bright as the sun,\r\nand let them, you and us, live together in perpetual love.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n_Speeches of John Baptist de Coigne, Chief of the Wabash and\r\nIllinois Indians, and other Indian Chiefs._\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson has the honor to send to the President the\r\nspeech of De Coigne, written at length from his notes very exactly.\r\nHe thinks he can assure the President that not a sentiment delivered\r\nby the French interpreter is omitted, nor a single one inserted\r\nwhich was not expressed. It differs often from what the\r\nEnglish interpreter delivered, because he varied much from the\r\nother, who alone was regarded by Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\n     February 1, 1793. The President having addressed the chiefs\r\n     of the Wabash and Illinois Indians, John Baptist De Coigne,\r\n     chief of Kaskaskia, spoke as follows:--\r\n\r\nFATHER,--I am about to open to you my heart. I salute first\r\nthe Great Spirit, the Master of life, and then you.\r\n\r\nI present you a black pipe on the death of chiefs who have\r\ncome here and died in your bed. It is the calumet of the dead--take\r\nit and smoke it in remembrance of them. The dead pray\r\nyou to listen to the living, and to be their friends. They are\r\ngone, we cannot recall them. Let us then be contented; for, as\r\nyou have said, to-morrow, perhaps, it may be our turn. Take\r\nthen their pipe, and as I have spoken for the dead, let me now\r\naddress you for the living. [He delivered the black pipe.]\r\n\r\n[Here Three-Legs, a Piankeshaw chief, came forward and carried\r\nround a white pipe, from which every one smoked.]\r\n\r\nJohn Baptist De Coigne spoke again:\r\n\r\n_Father_,--The sky is now cleared. I am about to open my\r\nheart to you again. I do it in the presence of the Great Spirit,\r\nand I pray you to attend.\r\n\r\nYou have heard the words of our father, General Putnam.\r\nWe opened our hearts to him, we made peace with him, and he\r\nhas told you what we said.\r\n\r\nThis pipe is white, I pray you to consider it as of the\r\nWyattanons, Piankeshaws, and the people of Eel river. The\r\nEnglish at Detroit are very jealous of our father. I have used\r\nmy best endeavors to keep all the red men in friendship with\r\nyou, but they have drawn over the one-half, while I have kept\r\nthe other. Be friendly then to those I have kept.\r\n\r\nI have long known you, General Washington, the Congress,\r\nJefferson, Sinclair. I have labored constantly for you to preserve\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nYou see your children on this side, [pointing to the friends of\r\nthe dead chief,] they are now orphans. Take care, then, of the\r\norphans of our dead friends.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--Your people of Kentucky are like mosquitos, and try\r\nto destroy the red men. The red men are like mosquitos also,\r\nand try to injure the people of Kentucky. But I look to you as\r\nto a good being. Order your people to be just. They are always\r\ntrying to get our lands. They come on our lands, they hunt\r\non them; kill our game, and kill us. Keep them then on one side\r\nof the line, and us on the other. Listen, father, to what we say,\r\nand protect the nations of the Wabash and Mississippi in their lands.\r\n\r\nThe English have often spoken to me, but I shut my ears to\r\nthem. I despise their money, it is nothing to me. I am attached\r\nto my lands. I love to eat in tranquillity, and not like\r\na bird on a bough.\r\n\r\nThe Piankeshaws, Wyattanons, Wiaws, and all the Indians of\r\nthe Mississippi and Wabash, pray you to open your heart and ears\r\nto them, and as you befriend them, to give them Captain Prior\r\nfor their father. We love him, men, women, and children of us.\r\nHe has always been friendly to us, always taken care of us, and\r\nyou cannot give us a better proof of your friendship than in leaving\r\nhim with us.\r\n\r\n[Here Three-Legs handed round the white pipe to be\r\nsmoked.] De Coigne, then, taking a third pipe, proceeded:\r\n\r\nThis pipe, my father, is sent you by the great chief of all the\r\nWiaws, called Crooked-Legs. He is old, infirm, and cannot\r\nwalk, therefore is not come. But he prays you to be his friend,\r\nand to take care of his people. He tells you there are many red\r\npeople jealous of you, but you need not fear them. If he could\r\nhave walked he would have come; but he is old and sick, and\r\ncannot walk. The English have a sugar mouth, but Crooked-Legs\r\nwould never listen to them. They threatened us to send\r\nthe red men to cut off him and his people, and they sent the red\r\nmen who threatened to do it, unless he would join the English.\r\nBut he would not join them.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs of the Wabash, father, pray you to listen. They\r\nsend you this pipe from afar. Keep your children quiet at the\r\nFalls of Ohio. We know you are the head of all. We appeal\r\nto you. Keep the Americans on one side of the Ohio, from the\r\nfalls downwards, and us on the other; that we may have something\r\nto live on according to your agreement in the treaty which\r\nyou have. And do not take from the French the lands we have\r\ngiven them.\r\n\r\nOld Crooked-Legs sends you this pipe, [here he presented it,]\r\nand he prays you to send him Captain Prior for his father, for\r\nhe is old, and you ought to do this for him.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--I pray you to listen. So far I have spoken for\r\nothers, and now will speak for myself. I am of Kaskaskia, and\r\nhave always been a good American from my youth upwards.\r\nYet the Kentuckians take my lands, eat my stock, steal my\r\nhorses, kill my game, and abuse our persons. I come far with\r\nall these people. My nation is not numerous. No people can\r\nfight against you father, but the Great God himself. All the red\r\nmen together cannot do it; but have pity on us. I am now old.\r\nDo not let the Kentuckians take my lands nor injure me, but\r\ngive me a line to them to let me alone.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--The Wyattanons, Piankeshaws, Piorias, Powtewatamies,\r\nMosquitoes, Kaskaskias, have now made a road to you. It\r\nis broad and white. Take care of it then, and keep it open.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--You are powerful. You said you would wipe away\r\nour tears. We thank you for this. Be firm, and take care of\r\nyour children.\r\n\r\nThe hatchet has been long buried. I have been always for\r\npeace. I have done what I could, given all the money I had to\r\nprocure it.\r\n\r\nThe half of my heart, father, is black. I brought the Piorias\r\nto you. Half of them are dead. I fear they will say it was my\r\nfault; but, father, I look upon you, my heart is white again, and\r\nI smile.\r\n\r\nThe Shawanese, the Delawares, and the English, are always\r\npersuading us to take up the hatchet against you, but I have\r\nbeen always deaf to their words. [Here he gave a belt.]\r\n\r\nGreat Joseph who came with us is dead. Have compassion\r\non his niece, his son-in-law, and his chiefs, [pointing to them.]\r\nIt is a dead man who speaks to you, father; accept, therefore,\r\nthese black beads. [Here he presented several strands of dark\r\ncolored beads.] I have now seen General Washington, I salute\r\nand regard him next after the Great Spirit.\r\n\r\nComo, a Powtewatamy chief, then said, that as the President\r\nhad already been long detained, and the hour was advanced, he\r\nwould resume what he had to say at another day.\r\n\r\nShawas, the Little Doe, a Kickapou chief, though very sick,\r\nhad attended the conference, and now carried the pipe round to\r\nbe smoked. He then addressed the President.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--I am still very ill, and unable to speak. I am a\r\nKickapou, and drink of the waters of the Wabash and Mississippi.\r\nI have been to the Wabash and treatied with General Putnam,\r\nand I came not to do ill, but to make peace. Send to us Captain\r\nPrior to be our father, and no other. He possesses all our love.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--I am too ill to speak. You will not forget what the\r\nothers have said.\r\n\r\n_February 2._--The day being cloudy, the Indians did not\r\nchoose to meet.\r\n\r\n_February 4._--The morning was cloudy, they gave notice\r\nthat if it should clear up they would attend at the President's\r\nat 2 o'clock. Accordingly, the clouds having broke away about\r\nnoon, they attended a little after 2, except Shawas and another,\r\nwho were sick, and one woman.\r\n\r\nComo, a Powtewatamy chief, spoke.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--I am opening my heart to speak to you, open yours\r\nto receive my words. I first address you from a dead chief, who\r\nwhen he was about to die, called us up to him and charged us\r\nnever to part with our lands. So I have done for you, my children,\r\nand so do you for yours. For what have we come so far?\r\nNot to ruin our nation, nor yet that we might carry goods home\r\nto our women and children; but to procure them lasting good, to\r\nopen a road between them and the whites, solicit our father to\r\nsend Captain Prior to us. He has taken good care of us, and\r\nwe all love him.\r\n\r\nNow, Father, I address you for our young people, but there\r\nremains not much to say, for I spoke to you through General\r\nPutnam, and you have what I said on paper. I have buried the\r\nhatchet forever, so must your children. I speak the truth, and\r\nyou must believe me. We all pray you to send Captain Prior\r\nto us, because he has been so very kind to us all. [Here he delivered\r\nstrands of dark colored beads.]\r\n\r\n_Father_,--Hear me and believe me. I speak the truth, and\r\nfrom my heart; receive my words then into yours. I am come\r\nfrom afar for the good of my women and children, for their\r\npresent and future good. When I was at home in the midst of\r\nthem, my heart sunk within me, I saw no hope for them. The\r\nheavens were gloomy and lowering, and I could not tell why.\r\nBut General Putnam spoke to us, and called us together. I rejoiced\r\nto hear him, and determined immediately to come and\r\nsee my father. Father, I am happy to see you. The heavens\r\nhave cleared away, the day is bright, and I rejoice to hear your\r\nvoice. These beads [holding up a bundle of white strands] are\r\na road between us. Take you hold at one end, I will at the\r\nother, and hold it fast. I will visit this road every day, and\r\nsweep it clean. If any blood be on it, I will cover it up; if\r\nstumps, I will cut them out. Should your children and mine\r\nmeet in this road they shall shake hands and be good friends.\r\nSome of the Indians who belong to the English will be trying\r\nto sow harm between us, but we must be on our guard and prevent\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--I love the land on which I was born, the trees which\r\ncover it, and the grass growing on it. It feeds us well. I am\r\nnot come here to ask gifts. I am young, and by hunting on my\r\nown land, can kill what I want and feed my women and children\r\nin plenty. I come not to beg. But if any of your traders\r\nwould wish to come among us, let them come. For who will\r\nhurt them? Nobody, I will be there before them.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--I take you by the hand with all my heart. I will\r\nnever forget you; do not you forget me.\r\n\r\n[Here he delivered the bundle of white strands.]\r\n\r\nThe Little Beaver, a Wyattanon, on the behalf of Crooked-Legs,\r\nhanded round the pipe, and then spoke.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--Listen now to me as you have done to others. I am\r\nnot a very great chief; I am a chief of war, and leader of the\r\nyoung people.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--I wished much to hear you; you have spoken comfort\r\nto us, and I am happy to have heard it. The sun has\r\nshone out, and all is well. This makes us think it was the\r\nGreat Spirit speaking truth through you. Do then what you\r\nhave said, restrain your people if they do wrong, as we will ours\r\nif they do wrong.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--We gave to our friend (Prior) who came with us,\r\nour name of Wyattanon, and he gave us his name of American.\r\nWe are now Americans, give him then unto us as a father. He\r\nhas loved us and taken care of us. He had pity on our women\r\nand children, and fed them. Do not forget to grant us this request.\r\nYou told us to live in quiet, and to do right. We will\r\ndo what you desire, and let Prior come to us.\r\n\r\nNow that we have come so far to hear you, write a line to\r\nyour people to keep the river open between us, that we may go\r\ndown in safety, and that our women and children may work in\r\npeace. When I go back, I will bear to them good tidings, and\r\nour young men will no longer hunt in fear for the support of our\r\nwomen and children.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--All of us who have heard you are made happy, all\r\nare in the same sentiment with me, all are satisfied. Be assured\r\nthat, when we return, the Indians and Americans will be one\r\npeople, will hunt, and play, and laugh together. For me, I never\r\nwill depart one step from Prior. We are come from afar to make\r\na stable peace, to look forward to our future good. Do not refuse\r\nwhat we solicit, we will never forget you.\r\n\r\nHere I will cease. The father of life might otherwise think\r\nI babbled too much, and so might you. I finish then, in giving\r\nyou this pipe. It is my own, and from myself alone. I am but\r\na warrior. I give it to you to smoke in. Let its fumes ascend\r\nto the Great Spirit in heaven.\r\n\r\n[He delivered the pipe to the President.]\r\n\r\nThe wife of the soldier, a Wyattanon, speaks:\r\n\r\n_Father_,--I take you by the hand with all my heart because\r\nyou have spoken comfort to us. I am but a woman, yet you\r\nmust listen.\r\n\r\nThe village chiefs, and chiefs of war, have opened their bodies\r\nand laid naked their hearts to you. Let them too see your heart\r\nand listen to them.\r\n\r\nWe have come, men and women, from afar to beseech you to\r\nlet no one take our lands. That is one of our children, [pointing\r\nto General Putnam.] It was he who persuaded us to come.\r\nWe thought he spoke the truth, we came, and we hope that good\r\nwill come of it.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--We know you are strong, have pity on us. Be firm\r\nin your words. They have given us courage. The father of\r\nlife has opened our hearts on both sides for good.\r\n\r\nHe who was to have spoken to you is dead, Great Joseph. If\r\nhe had lived you would have heard a good man, and good words\r\nflowing from his mouth. He was my uncle, and it has fallen to\r\nme to speak for him. But I am ignorant. Excuse, then, these\r\nwords, it is but a woman who speaks.\r\n\r\n[She delivers white strands.]\r\n\r\nThree-Legs, a Piankeshaw spoke.\r\n\r\nI speak for a young chief whom I have lost here. He came\r\nto speak to you, father, but he had not that happiness. He died.\r\nI am not a village chief, but only a chief of war.\r\n\r\nWe are come to seek all our good, and to be firm in it. If\r\nour father is firm, we will be so. It was a dark and gloomy\r\nday in which I lost my young chief. The master of life saw\r\nthat he was good, and called him to himself. We must submit\r\nto his will. [He gave a black strand.] I pray you all who are\r\npresent to say, as one man, that our peace is firm, and to let it be\r\nfirm. Listen to us if you love us. We live on the river on one\r\nside, and shall be happy to see Captain Prior on the other, and\r\nto have a lasting peace. Here is our father Putnam. He\r\nheard me speak at Au Porte. If I am false let him say so.\r\n\r\nMy land is but small. If any more be taken from us, I will\r\ncome again to you and complain, for we shall not be able to live.\r\nHave pity on us father. You have many red children there,\r\nand they have little whereon to live. Leave them land enough\r\nto labor, to hunt, and to live on, and the lands which we have\r\ngiven to the French, let them be to them forever.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--We are very poor, we have traders among us, but\r\nthey will sell too dear. We have not the means of supplying\r\nour wants at such prices. Encourage your traders then to come,\r\nand to bring us guns, powder, and other necessaries, and send\r\nCaptain Prior also to us.\r\n\r\n[He gave a string of white beads.] De Coigne spoke:\r\n\r\nJefferson, I have seen you before, and we have spoken together.\r\nSinclair, we have opened our hearts to one another. Putnam,\r\nwe did the same at Au Porte.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--You have heard these three speak of me, and you\r\nknow my character. The times are gloomy in my town. We\r\nhave no commander, no soldier, no priest. Have you no concern\r\nfor us, father? If you have, put a magistrate with us to\r\nkeep the peace. I cannot live so. I am of French blood. When\r\nthere are no priests among us we think that all is not well.\r\nWhen I was small we had priests, now that I am old we have\r\nnone; am I to forget, then, how to pray? Have pity on me and\r\ngrant what I ask. I have spoken on your behalf to all the nations.\r\nI am a friend to all, and hurt none. For what are we\r\non this earth? But as a small and tender plant of corn; even\r\nas nothing. God has made this earth for you as well as for us;\r\nwe are then but as one family, and if any one strikes you, it is\r\nas if he had struck us. If any nation strikes you, father, we\r\nwill let you know what nation it is.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--We fear the Kentuckians. They are headstrong,\r\nand do us great wrong. They are not content to come on our\r\nlands, to hunt on them, to steal and destroy our stocks, as the\r\nShawanese and Delawares do, but they go further, and abuse our\r\npersons. Forbid them to do so. Sinclair, you know that the\r\nShawanese and Delawares came from the Spanish side of the\r\nriver, destroyed our corn, and killed our cattle. We cannot live\r\nif things go so.\r\n\r\n_Father_,--You are rich, you have all things at command, you\r\nwant for nothing, you promised to wipe away our tears. I commend\r\nour women and children to your care.\r\n\r\n[He gave strands of white beads.]\r\n\r\nThe President then assured them that he would take in consideration\r\nwhat they had said, and would give them an answer\r\non another day; whereupon the conference ended for the present.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n                                                      January 7, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Brothers and friends of the Miamis, Powtewatamies, and Weeauks:--_\r\n\r\nI receive with great satisfaction the visit you have been so\r\nkind as to make us at this place, and I thank the Great Spirit who\r\nhas conducted you to us in health and safety. It is well that\r\nfriends should sometimes meet, open their minds mutually, and\r\nrenew the chain of affection. Made by the same Great Spirit,\r\nand living in the same land with our brothers, the red men, we\r\nconsider ourselves as of the same family; we wish to live with\r\nthem as one people, and to cherish their interests as our own.\r\nThe evils which of necessity encompass the life of man are sufficiently\r\nnumerous. Why should we add to them by voluntarily\r\ndistressing and destroying one another? Peace, brothers, is better\r\nthan war. In a long and bloody war, we lose many friends,\r\nand gain nothing. Let us then live in peace and friendship together,\r\ndoing to each other all the good we can. The wise and\r\ngood on both sides desire this, and we must take care that the\r\nfoolish and wicked among us shall not prevent it. On our part,\r\nwe shall endeavor in all things to be just and generous towards\r\nyou, and to aid you in meeting those difficulties which a change\r\nof circumstances is bringing on. We shall, with great pleasure,\r\nsee your people become disposed to cultivate the earth, to raise\r\nherds of the useful animals, and to spin and weave, for their food\r\nand clothing. These resources are certain; they will never disappoint\r\nyou: while those of hunting may fail, and expose your\r\nwomen and children to the miseries of hunger and cold. We\r\nwill with pleasure furnish you with implements for the most\r\nnecessary arts, and with persons who may instruct you how to\r\nmake and use them.\r\n\r\nI consider it as fortunate that you have made your visit at this\r\ntime, when our wise men from the sixteen States are collected\r\ntogether in council, who being equally disposed to befriend you,\r\ncan strengthen our hands in the good we all wish to render you.\r\n\r\nThe several matters you opened to us in your speech the other\r\nday, and those on which you have since conversed with the\r\nSecretary of War, have been duly considered by us. He will\r\nnow deliver answers, and you are to consider what he says, as\r\nif said by myself, and that what we promise we shall faithfully\r\nperform.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n                                                    February 10, 1802.\r\n\r\n_Brothers of the Delaware and Shawanee nations_:--\r\n\r\nI thank the Great Spirit that he has conducted you hither in\r\nhealth and safety, and that we have an opportunity of renewing\r\nour amity, and of holding friendly conference together. It is a\r\ncircumstance of great satisfaction to us that we are in peace and\r\ngood understanding with all our red brethren, and that we discover\r\nin them the same disposition to continue so which we feel\r\nourselves. It is our earnest desire to merit, and possess their\r\naffections, by rendering them strict justice, prohibiting injury from\r\nothers, aiding their endeavors to learn the culture of the earth,\r\nand to raise useful animals, and befriending them as good neighbors,\r\nand in every other way in our power. By mutual endeavors\r\nto do good to each other, the happiness of both will be better\r\npromoted than by efforts of mutual destruction. We are all\r\ncreated by the same Great Spirit; children of the same family.\r\nWhy should we not live then as brothers ought to do?\r\n\r\nI am peculiarly gratified by receiving the visit of some of your\r\nmost ancient and greatest warriors, of whom I have heard much\r\ngood. It is a long journey which they have taken at their age,\r\nand in this season, and I consider it as a proof that their affections\r\nfor us are sincere and strong. I hope that the young men,\r\nwho have come with them, to make acquaintance with us, judging\r\nour dispositions towards them by what they see themselves,\r\nand not what they may hear from others, will go hand in hand\r\nwith us, through life, in the cultivation of mutual peace, friendship,\r\nand good offices.\r\n\r\nThe speech which the Blackhoof delivered us, in behalf of\r\nyour nation, has been duly considered. The answer to all its\r\nparticulars will now be delivered you by the Secretary of War.\r\nWhatever he shall say, you may consider as if said by myself,\r\nand that what he promises our nation will perform.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n                                         WASHINGTON, November 3, 1802.\r\n\r\n_To Brother Handsome Lake_:--\r\n\r\nI have received the message in writing which you sent me\r\nthrough Captain Irvine, our confidential agent, placed near you\r\nfor the purpose of communicating and transacting between us,\r\nwhatever may be useful for both nations. I am happy to learn\r\nyou have been so far favored by the Divine spirit as to be made\r\nsensible of those things which are for your good and that of your\r\npeople, and of those which are hurtful to you; and particularly\r\nthat you and they see the ruinous effects which the abuse of\r\nspirituous liquors have produced upon them. It has weakened\r\ntheir bodies, enervated their minds, exposed them to hunger,\r\ncold, nakedness, and poverty, kept them in perpetual broils, and\r\nreduced their population. I do not wonder then, brother, at\r\nyour censures, not only on your own people, who have voluntarily\r\ngone into these fatal habits, but on all the nations of white\r\npeople who have supplied their calls for this article. But these\r\nnations have done to you only what they do among themselves.\r\nThey have sold what individuals wish to buy, leaving to every\r\none to be the guardian of his own health and happiness. Spirituous\r\nliquors are not in themselves bad, they are often found to\r\nbe an excellent medicine for the sick; it is the improper and intemperate\r\nuse of them, by those in health, which makes them\r\ninjurious. But as you find that your people cannot refrain from\r\nan ill use of them, I greatly applaud your resolution not to use\r\nthem at all. We have too affectionate a concern for your happiness\r\nto place the paltry gain on the sale of these articles in competition\r\nwith the injury they do you. And as it is the desire\r\nof your nation, that no spirits should be sent among them,\r\nI am authorized by the great council of the United States to prohibit\r\nthem. I will sincerely coöperate with your wise men in\r\nany proper measures for this purpose, which shall be agreeable to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nYou remind me, brother, of what I said to you, when you\r\nvisited me the last winter, that the lands you then held would\r\nremain yours, and shall never go from you but when you should\r\nbe disposed to sell. This I now repeat, and will ever abide by.\r\nWe, indeed, are always ready to buy land; but we will never ask\r\nbut when you wish to sell; and our laws, in order to protect you\r\nagainst imposition, have forbidden individuals to purchase lands\r\nfrom you; and have rendered it necessary, when you desire to\r\nsell, even to a State, that an agent from the United States should\r\nattend the sale, see that your consent is freely given, a satisfactory\r\nprice paid, and report to us what has been done, for our approbation.\r\nThis was done in the late case of which you complain.\r\nThe deputies of your nation came forward, in all the forms\r\nwhich we have been used to consider as evidence of the will of\r\nyour nation. They proposed to sell to the State of New York\r\ncertain parcels of land, of small extent, and detached from the\r\nbody of your other lands; the State of New York was desirous\r\nto buy. I sent an agent, in whom we could trust, to see that\r\nyour consent was free, and the sale fair. All was reported to be\r\nfree and fair. The lands were your property. The right to sell\r\nis one of the rights of property. To forbid you the exercise of\r\nthat right would be a wrong to your nation. Nor do I think,\r\nbrother, that the sale of lands is, under all circumstances, injurious\r\nto your people. While they depended on hunting, the\r\nmore extensive the forest around them, the more game they\r\nwould yield. But going into a state of agriculture, it may be as\r\nadvantageous to a society, as it is to an individual, who has more\r\nland than he can improve, to sell a part, and lay out the money\r\nin stocks and implements of agriculture, for the better improvement\r\nof the residue. A little land well stocked and improved,\r\nwill yield more than a great deal without stock or improvement.\r\nI hope, therefore, that on further reflection, you will see this\r\ntransaction in a more favorable light, both as it concerns the interest\r\nof your nation, and the exercise of that superintending\r\ncare which I am sincerely anxious to employ for their subsistence\r\nand happiness. Go on then, brother, in the great reformation\r\nyou have undertaken. Persuade our red brethren then to be\r\nsober, and to cultivate their lands; and their women to spin and\r\nweave for their families. You will soon see your women and\r\nchildren well fed and clothed, your men living happily in peace\r\nand plenty, and your numbers increasing from year to year. It\r\nwill be a great glory to you to have been the instrument of so\r\nhappy a change, and your children's children, from generation\r\nto generation, will repeat your name with love and gratitude forever.\r\nIn all your enterprises for the good of your people, you may\r\ncount with confidence on the aid and protection of the United\r\nStates, and on the sincerity and zeal with which I am myself\r\nanimated in the furthering of this humane work. You are our\r\nbrethren of the same land; we wish your prosperity as brethren\r\nshould do. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n                                                      January 8, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Brothers Miamis and Delawares_:--\r\n\r\nI am happy to see you here, to take you by the hand, and to\r\nrenew the assurances of our friendship. The journey which you\r\nhave taken is long; but it leads to a right understanding of what\r\neither of us may have misunderstood; it will be useful for all.\r\nFor, living in the same land, it is best for us all that we should\r\nlive together in peace, friendship, and good neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI have taken into serious consideration the several subjects on\r\nwhich you spoke to me the other day, and will now proceed to\r\nanswer them severally.\r\n\r\nYou know, brothers, that, in ancient times, your former fathers\r\nthe French settled at Vincennes, and lived and traded with your\r\nancestors, and that those ancestors ceded to the French a tract\r\nof country, on the Wabash river, seventy leagues broad, and extending\r\nin length from Point Coupee to the mouth of White\r\nriver. The French, at the close of a war between them and the\r\nEnglish, ceded this country to the English; who, at the close of\r\na war between them and us, ceded it to us. The remembrance\r\nof these transactions is well preserved among the white people;\r\nthey have been acknowledged in a deed signed by your fathers;\r\nand you also, we suppose, must have heard it from them. Sincerely\r\ndesirous to live in peace and brotherhood with you, and\r\nthat the hatchet of war may never again be lifted, we thought\r\nit prudent to remove from between us whatever might at any\r\ntime produce misunderstanding. The unmarked state of our\r\nboundaries, and mutual trespasses on each others' lands, for want\r\nof their being known to all our people, have at times threatened\r\nour peace. We therefore instructed Governor Harrison to call a\r\nmeeting of the chiefs of all the Indian nations around Vincennes,\r\nand to propose that we should settle and mark the boundary between\r\nus. The chiefs of these nations met. They appeared to\r\nthink hard that we should claim the whole of what their ancestors\r\nhad ceded and sold to the white men, and proposed to mark\r\noff for us from Point Coupee to the mouth of White river, a\r\nbreadth of twenty-four leagues only, instead of seventy. His\r\noffer was a little more than a third of our right. But the desire\r\nof being in peace and friendship with you, and of doing nothing\r\nwhich should distress you, prevailed in our minds, and we agreed\r\nto it. This was the act of the several nations, original owners\r\nof the soil, and by men duly authorized by the body of those\r\nnations. You, brothers, seem not to have been satisfied with it.\r\nBut it is a rule in all countries that what is done by the body\r\nof a nation must be submitted to by all its members. We have\r\nno right to alter, on a partial deputation, what we have settled\r\nby treaty with the body of the nations concerned. The lines\r\ntoo, which are agreed on, are to be run and marked in the presence\r\nof your chiefs, who will see that they are fairly run. Your\r\nnations were so sensible of the moderation of our conduct towards\r\nthem, that they voluntarily offered to lend us forever the salt\r\nsprings, and four miles square of land near the mouth of the\r\nWabash, without price. But we wish nothing without price.\r\nAnd we propose to make a reasonable addition to the annuity\r\nwe pay to the owners.\r\n\r\nYou complain that our people buy your lands individually,\r\nand settle and hunt on them without leave. To convince you\r\nof the care we have taken to guard you against the injuries and\r\narts of interested individuals, I now will give you a copy of a\r\nlaw, of our great council the Congress, forbidding individuals to\r\nbuy lands from you, or to settle or hunt on your lands; and making\r\nthem liable to severe punishment. And if you will at any\r\ntime seize such individuals, and deliver them to any officer of the\r\nUnited States, they will be punished according to law.\r\n\r\nWe have long been sensible, brothers, of the great injury you\r\nreceive from an immoderate use of spirituous liquors; and although\r\nit be profitable to us to make and sell these liquors, yet\r\nwe value more the preservation of your health and happiness.\r\nHeretofore we apprehended you would be displeased, were we to\r\nwithhold them from you. But leaving it to be your desire, we\r\nhave taken measures to prevent their being carried into your\r\ncountry; and we sincerely rejoice at this proof of your wisdom.\r\nInstead of spending the produce of your hunting in purchasing\r\nthis pernicious drink, which produces poverty, broils and murders,\r\nit will now be employed in procuring food and clothing\r\nfor your families, and increasing instead of diminishing your\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nYou have proposed, brothers, that we should deduct from your\r\nnext year's annuity, the expenses of your journey here; but this\r\nwould be an exactness we do not practise with our red brethren.\r\nWe will bear with satisfaction the expenses of your journey,\r\nand of whatever is necessary for your personal comfort; and\r\nwill not, by deducting them, lessen the amount of the necessaries\r\nwhich your women and children are to receive the next\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nFrom the same good will towards you, we shall be pleased to\r\nsee you making progress in raising stock and grain, and making\r\nclothes for yourselves. A little labor in this way, performed at\r\nhome and at ease, will go further towards feeding and clothing\r\nyou, than a great deal of labor in hunting wild beasts.\r\n\r\nIn answer to your request of a smith to be stationed in some\r\nplace convenient to you, I can inform you that Mr. Wells, our\r\nagent, is authorized to make such establishments, and also to furnish\r\nyou with implements of husbandry and manufacture, whenever\r\nyou shall be determined to use them. The particulars on\r\nthis subject, as well as of some others mentioned in your speech,\r\nand in the written speech you brought me from Buckangalah\r\nand others, will be communicated and settled with you by the\r\nSecretary at War. And I shall pray you in your return, to be\r\nthe bearers to your countrymen and friends of assurances of my\r\nsincere friendship, and that our nation wishes to befriend them\r\nin everything useful, and to protect them against all injuries\r\ncommitted by lawless persons from among our citizens, either on\r\ntheir lands, their lives or their property.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n                                                    December 17, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Brothers of the Choctaw nation_:--\r\n\r\nWe have long heard of your nation as a numerous, peaceable,\r\nand friendly people; but this is the first visit we have had from\r\nits great men at the seat of our government. I welcome you\r\nhere; am glad to take you by the hand, and to assure you, for\r\nyour nation, that we are their friends. Born in the same land,\r\nwe ought to live as brothers, doing to each other all the good we\r\ncan, and not listening to wicked men, who may endeavor to\r\nmake us enemies. By living in peace, we can help and prosper\r\none another; by waging war, we can kill and destroy many on\r\nboth sides; but those who survive will not be the happier for\r\nthat. Then, brothers, let it forever be peace and good neighborhood\r\nbetween us. Our seventeen States compose a great and\r\ngrowing nation. Their children are as the leaves of the trees,\r\nwhich the winds are spreading over the forest. But we are just\r\nalso. We take from no nation what belongs to it. Our growing\r\nnumbers make us always willing to buy lands from our red\r\nbrethren, when they are willing to sell. But be assured we\r\nnever mean to disturb them in their possessions. On the contrary,\r\nthe lines established between us by mutual consent, shall\r\nbe sacredly preserved, and will protect your lands from all encroachments\r\nby our own people or any others. We will give\r\nyou a copy of the law, made by our great Council, for punishing\r\nour people, who may encroach on your lands, or injure you\r\notherwise. Carry it with you to your homes, and preserve it,\r\nas the shield which we spread over you, to protect your land,\r\nyour property and persons.\r\n\r\nIt is at the request which you sent me in September, signed\r\nby Puckshanublee and other chiefs, and which you now repeat,\r\nthat I listen to your proposition, to sell us lands. You say you\r\nowe a great debt to your merchants, that you have nothing to\r\npay it with but lands, and you pray us to take lands, and pay\r\nyour debt. The sum you have occasion for, brothers, is a very\r\ngreat one. We have never yet paid as much to any of our red\r\nbrethren for the purchase of lands. You propose to us some on\r\nthe Tombigbee, and some on the Mississippi. Those on the\r\nMississippi suit us well. We wish to have establishments on\r\nthat river, as resting places for our boats, to furnish them provisions,\r\nand to receive our people who fall sick on the way to or\r\nfrom New Orleans, which is now ours. In that quarter, therefore,\r\nwe are willing to purchase as much as you will spare. But\r\nas to the manner in which the line shall be run, we are not\r\njudges of it here, nor qualified to make any bargain. But we\r\nwill appoint persons hereafter to treat with you on the spot, who,\r\nknowing the country and quality of the lands, will be better able\r\nto agree with you on a line which will give us a just equivalent\r\nfor the sum of money you want paid.\r\n\r\nYou have spoken, brothers, of the lands which your fathers\r\nformerly sold and marked off to the English, and which they\r\nceded to us with the rest of the country they held here; and\r\nyou say that, though you do not know whether your fathers\r\nwere paid for them, you have marked the line over again for us,\r\nand do not ask repayment. It has always been the custom,\r\nbrothers, when lands were bought of the red men, to pay for\r\nthem immediately, and none of us have ever seen an example of\r\nsuch a debt remaining unpaid. It is to satisfy their immediate\r\nwants that the red men have usually sold lands; and in such a\r\ncase, they would not let the debt be unpaid. The presumption\r\nfrom custom then is strong; so it is also from the great length\r\nof time since your fathers sold these lands. But we have, moreover,\r\nbeen informed by persons now living, and who assisted the\r\nEnglish in making the purchase, that the price was paid at the\r\ntime. Were it otherwise, as it was their contract, it would be\r\ntheir debt, not ours.\r\n\r\nI rejoice, brothers, to hear you propose to become cultivators\r\nof the earth for the maintenance of your families. Be assured\r\nyou will support them better and with less labor, by raising\r\nstock and bread, and by spinning and weaving clothes, than by\r\nhunting. A little land cultivated, and a little labor, will procure\r\nmore provisions than the most successful hunt; and a woman\r\nwill clothe more by spinning and weaving, than a man by hunting.\r\nCompared with you, we are but as of yesterday in this\r\nland. Yet see how much more we have multiplied by industry,\r\nand the exercise of that reason which you possess in common\r\nwith us. Follow then our example, brethren, and we will aid\r\nyou with great pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe clothes and other necessaries which we sent you the last\r\nyear, were, as you supposed, a present from us. We never meant\r\nto ask land or any other payment for them; and the store which\r\nwe sent on, was at your request also; and to accommodate you\r\nwith necessaries at a reasonable price, you wished of course to\r\nhave it on your land; but the land would continue yours, not\r\nours.\r\n\r\nAs to the removal of the store, the interpreter, and the agent,\r\nand any other matters you may wish to speak about, the Secretary\r\nat War will enter into explanations with you, and whatever\r\nhe says, you may consider as said by myself, and what he promises\r\nyou will be faithfully performed.\r\n\r\nI am glad, brothers, you are willing to go and visit some other\r\nparts of our country. Carriages shall be ready to convey you,\r\nand you shall be taken care of on your journey; and when you\r\nshall have returned here and rested yourselves to your own mind,\r\nyou shall be sent home by land. We had provided for your\r\ncoming by land, and were sorry for the mistake which carried\r\nyou to Savannah instead of Augusta, and exposed you to the\r\nrisks of a voyage by sea. Had any accident happened to you,\r\nthough we could not help it, it would have been a cause of great\r\nmourning to us. But we thank the Great Spirit who took care\r\nof you on the ocean, and brought you safe and in good health\r\nto the seat of our great Council; and we hope His care will accompany\r\nand protect you, on your journey and return home;\r\nand that He will preserve and prosper your nation in all its just\r\npursuits.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n_My Children, White-hairs, Chiefs, and Warriors of the Osage\r\nNation_:--\r\n\r\nI repeat to you assurances of the satisfaction it gives me to receive\r\nyou here. Besides the labor of such a journey, the confidence\r\nyou have shown in the honor and friendship of my countrymen\r\nis peculiarly gratifying, and I hope you have seen that your\r\nconfidence was justly placed, that you have found yourselves,\r\nsince you crossed the Mississippi, among brothers and friends,\r\nwith whom you were as safe as at home.\r\n\r\n_My Children_,--I sincerely weep with you over the graves of\r\nyour chiefs and friends, who fell by the hands of their enemies\r\nlately descending the Osage river. Had they been prisoners,\r\nand living, we would have recovered them. But no voice can\r\nawake the dead; no power undo what is done. On this side the\r\nMississippi, where our government has been long established,\r\nand our authority organized, our friends visiting us are safe.\r\nWe hope it will not be long before our voice will be heard\r\nand our arm respected, by those who meditate to injure our\r\nfriends on the other side of that river. In the meantime, Governor\r\nHarrison will be directed to take proper measures to inquire\r\ninto the circumstances of the transaction, to report them to\r\nus for consideration, and for the further measures they may require.\r\n\r\n_My Children_,--By late arrangements with France and Spain,\r\nwe now take their place as your neighbors, friends, and fathers;\r\nand we hope you will have no cause to regret the change. It is\r\nso long since our forefathers came from beyond the great water,\r\nthat we have lost the memory of it, and seem to have grown out\r\nof this land, as you have done. Never more will you have occasion\r\nto change your fathers. We are all now of one family,\r\nborn in the same land, and bound to live as brothers; and the\r\nstrangers from beyond the great water are gone from among us.\r\nThe Great Spirit has given you strength, and has given us\r\nstrength; not that we might hurt one another, but to do each\r\nother all the good in our power. Our dwellings, indeed, are\r\nvery far apart, but not too far to carry on commerce and useful\r\nintercourse. You have furs and peltries which we want, and we\r\nhave clothes and other useful things which you want. Let us\r\nemploy ourselves, then, in mutually accommodating each other.\r\nTo begin this on our part, it was necessary to know what nations\r\ninhabited the great country called Louisiana, which embraces\r\nall the waters of the Mississippi and Missouri, what number\r\nof peltries they could furnish, what quantities and kind of\r\nmerchandize they would require, where would be the deposits\r\nmost convenient for them, and to make an exact map of all those\r\nwaters. For this purpose I sent a beloved man, Captain Lewis,\r\none of my own household, to learn something of the people with\r\nwhom we are now united, to let you know we were your friends,\r\nto invite you to come and see us, and to tell us how we can be\r\nuseful to you. I thank you for the readiness with which you\r\nhave listened to his voice, and for the favor you have showed\r\nhim in his passage up the Missouri. I hope your countrymen\r\nwill favor and protect him as far as they extend. On his return\r\nwe shall hear what he has seen and learnt, and proceed to establish\r\ntrading houses where our red brethren shall think best,\r\nand to exchange commodities with them on terms with which\r\nthey will be satisfied.\r\n\r\nWith the same views I had prepared another party to go up\r\nthe Red River to its source, thence to the source of the Arkansas,\r\nand down it to its mouth. But I will now give orders that they\r\nshall only go a small distance up the Red River this season, and\r\nreturn to tell us what they have seen, and that they shall not set\r\nout for the head of that river till the ensuing spring, when you\r\nwill be at home, and will, I hope, guide and guard them in their\r\njourney. I also propose the next year to send another small\r\nparty up the river of the Kansas to its source, thence to the head\r\nof the river of the Panis, and down to its mouth; and others up\r\nthe rivers on the north side of the Missouri. For guides along\r\nthese rivers, we must make arrangements with the nations inhabiting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n_My Children_,--I was sorry to learn that a schism had taken\r\nplace in your nation, and that a part of your people had withdrawn\r\nwith the Great-Track to the Arkansas river. We will send\r\nan agent to them, and will use our best offices to induce them to\r\nreturn, and to live in union with you. We wish to make them\r\nalso our friends, and to make that friendship, and the weight it\r\nmay give us with them, useful to you and them.\r\n\r\nWe propose, my children, immediately to establish an agent\r\nto reside with you, who will speak to you our words, and convey\r\nyours to us, who will be the guardian of our peace and friendship,\r\nconvey truths from one to the other, dissipate all falsehoods\r\nwhich might tend to alienate and divide us, and maintain a good\r\nunderstanding and friendship between us. As the distance is\r\ntoo great for you to come often and tell us your wants, you will\r\ntell them to him on the spot, and he will convey them to us in\r\nwriting, so that we shall be sure that they come from you.\r\nThrough the intervention of such an agent we shall hope that\r\nour friendship will forever be preserved. No wrong will ever be\r\ndone you by our nation, and we trust that yours will do none to\r\nus. And should ungovernable individuals commit unauthorized\r\noutrage on either side, let them be duly punished; or if they escape,\r\nlet us make to each other the best satisfaction the case\r\nadmits, and not let our peace be broken by bad men. For all\r\npeople have some bad men among them, whom no laws can restrain.\r\n\r\nAs you have taken so long a journey to see your father, we\r\nwish you not to return till you shall have visited our country\r\nand towns toward the sea coast. This will be new and satisfactory\r\nto you, and it will give you the same knowledge of the\r\ncountry on this side the Mississippi, which we are endeavoring\r\nto acquire of that on the other side, by sending trusty persons to\r\nexplore them. We propose to do in your country only what we\r\nare desirous you should do in ours. We will provide accommodations\r\nfor your journey, for your comfort while engaged in it,\r\nand for your return in safety to your own country, carrying with\r\nyou those proofs of esteem with which we distinguish our friends,\r\nand shall particularly distinguish you. On your return tell your\r\npeople that I take them all by the hand; that I become their\r\nfather hereafter; that they shall know our nation only as friends\r\nand benefactors; that we have no views upon them but to carry\r\non a commerce useful to them and us; to keep them in peace\r\nwith their neighbors, that their children may multiply, may grow\r\nup and live to a good old age, and their women no more fear the\r\ntomahawk of any enemy.\r\n\r\nMy children, these are my words, carry them to your nation,\r\nkeep them in your memories, and our friendship in your hearts,\r\nand may the Great Spirit look down upon us and cover us with\r\nthe mantle of his love.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.\r\n\r\n                                                        March 7, 1805.\r\n\r\n_My Children, Chiefs of the Chickasaw nation, Minghey, Mataha, and\r\nTishohotana_:--\r\n\r\nI am happy to receive you at the seat of the government of\r\nthe twenty-two nations, and to take you by the hand. Your\r\nfriendship to the Americans has long been known to me. Our\r\nfathers have told us that your nation never spilled the blood of\r\nan American, and we have seen you fighting by our side and\r\ncementing our friendship by mixing our blood in battle against\r\nthe same enemies. I rejoice, therefore, that the Great Spirit has\r\ncovered you with his protection through so long a journey and\r\nso inclement a season, and brought you safe to the dwelling of\r\na father who wishes well to all his red children, and to you especially.\r\nIt would have been also pleasing to have received the\r\nother chiefs who had proposed to come with you, and to have\r\nknown and become known to them, had it been convenient for\r\nthem to come. I have long wished to see the beloved men of\r\nyour nation, to renew the friendly conferences of former times,\r\nto assure them that we remain constant in our attachment to\r\nthem, and to prove it by our good offices.\r\n\r\nYour country, like all those on this side the Mississippi, has\r\nno longer game sufficient to maintain yourselves, your women\r\nand children, comfortably by hunting. We, therefore, wish to\r\nsee you undertake the cultivation of the earth, to raise cattle,\r\ncorn, and cotton, to feed and clothe your people. A little labor\r\nin the earth will produce more food than the best hunts you can\r\nnow make, and the women will spin and weave more clothing\r\nthan the men can procure by hunting. We shall very willingly\r\nassist you in this course by furnishing you with the necessary\r\ntools and implements, and with persons to instruct you in the\r\nuse of them.\r\n\r\nWe have been told that you have contracted a great debt to\r\nsome British traders, which gives you uneasiness, and which you\r\nhonestly wish to pay by the sale of some of your lands. Whenever\r\nyou raise food from the earth, and make your own clothing,\r\nyou will find that you have a great deal of land more than\r\nyou can cultivate or make useful, and that it will be better for\r\nyou to sell some of that, to pay your debts, and to have something\r\nover to be paid to you annually to aid you in feeding and\r\nclothing yourselves. Your lands are your own, my children,\r\nthey shall never be taken from you by our people or any others.\r\nYou will be free to keep or to sell as yourselves shall think most\r\nfor your own good. If at this time you think it will be better\r\nfor you to dispose of some of them to pay your debts, and to\r\nhelp your people to improve the rest, we are willing to buy on\r\nreasonable terms. Our people multiply so fast that it will suit us\r\nto buy as much as you wish to sell, but only according to your\r\ngood will. We have lately obtained from the French and Spaniards\r\nall the country beyond the Mississippi called Louisiana, in\r\nwhich there is a great deal of land unoccupied by any red men.\r\nBut it is very far off, and we would prefer giving you lands\r\nthere, or money and goods as you like best, for such parts of your\r\nland on this side the Mississippi as you are disposed to part with.\r\nShould you have anything to say on this subject now, or at any\r\nfuture time, we shall be always ready to listen to you.\r\n\r\nI am obliged, within a few days, to set out on a long journey;\r\nbut I wish you to stay and rest yourselves according to your own\r\nconvenience. The Secretary at War will take care of you, will\r\nhave you supplied with whatever you may have occasion for,\r\nand will provide for your return at your own pleasure. And I\r\nhope you will carry to your countrymen assurances of the sincere\r\nfriendship of the United States to them, and that we shall\r\nalways be disposed to render them all the service in our power.\r\nThis, my children, is all I had proposed to say at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n_To the Wolf and people of the Mandar nation._\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, December 30, 1806.\r\n\r\n_My Children, the Wolf and people of the Mandar nation._--I\r\ntake you by the hand of friendship and give you a hearty\r\nwelcome to the seat of the government of the United States.\r\nThe journey which you have taken to visit your fathers on\r\nthis side of our island is a long one, and your having undertaken\r\nit is a proof that you desired to become acquainted with\r\nus. I thank the Great Spirit that he has protected you through\r\nthe journey and brought you safely to the residence of your\r\nfriends, and I hope He will have you constantly in his safe keeping,\r\nand restore you in good health to your nations and families.\r\n\r\nMy friends and children, we are descended from the old nations\r\nwhich live beyond the great water, but we and our forefathers\r\nhave been so long here that we seem like you to have\r\ngrown out of this land. We consider ourselves no longer of the\r\nold nations beyond the great water, but as united in one family\r\nwith our red brethren here. The French, the English, the Spaniards,\r\nhave now agreed with us to retire from all the country which\r\nyou and we hold between Canada and Mexico, and never more\r\nto return to it. And remember the words I now speak to you,\r\nmy children, they are never to return again. We are now your\r\nfathers; and you shall not lose by the change. As soon as Spain\r\nhad agreed to withdraw from all the waters of the Missouri and\r\nMississippi, I felt the desire of becoming acquainted with all my\r\nred children beyond the Mississippi, and of uniting them with\r\nus as we have those on this side of that river, in the bonds of\r\npeace and friendship. I wished to learn what we could do to\r\nbenefit them by furnishing them the necessaries they want in\r\nexchange for their furs and peltries. I therefore sent our beloved\r\nman, Captain Lewis, one of my own family, to go up the\r\nMissouri river to get acquainted with all the Indian nations in its\r\nneighborhood, to take them by the hand, deliver my talks to them,\r\nand to inform us in what way we could be useful to them. Your\r\nnation received him kindly, you have taken him by the hand and\r\nbeen friendly to him. My children, I thank you for the services\r\nyou rendered him, and for your attention to his words. He will\r\nnow tell us where we should establish trading houses to be convenient\r\nto you all, and what we must send to them.\r\n\r\nMy friends and children, I have now an important advice to\r\ngive you. I have already told you that you and all the red men\r\nare my children, and I wish you to live in peace and friendship\r\nwith one another as brethren of the same family ought to\r\ndo. How much better is it for neighbors to help than to\r\nhurt one another; how much happier must it make them. If you\r\nwill cease to make war on one another, if you will live in friendship\r\nwith all mankind, you can employ all your time in providing\r\nfood and clothing for yourselves and your families. Your men\r\nwill not be destroyed in war, and your women and children will\r\nlie down to sleep in their cabins without fear of being surprised\r\nby their enemies and killed or carried away. Your numbers will\r\nbe increased instead of diminishing, and you will live in plenty\r\nand in quiet. My children, I have given this advice to all your\r\nred brethren on this side of the Mississippi; they are following\r\nit, they are increasing in their numbers, are learning to clothe and\r\nprovide for their families as we do. Remember then my advice,\r\nmy children, carry it home to your people, and tell them that\r\nfrom the day that they have become all of the same family, from\r\nthe day that we became father to them all, we wish, as a true\r\nfather should do, that we may all live together as one household,\r\nand that before they strike one another, they should go to their\r\nfather and let him endeavor to make up the quarrel.\r\n\r\nMy children, you are come from the other side of our great\r\nisland, from where the sun sets, to see your new friends at the\r\nsun rising. You have now arrived where the waters are constantly\r\nrising and falling every day, but you are still distant from\r\nthe sea. I very much desire that you should not stop here, but\r\ngo and see your brethren as far as the edge of the great water.\r\nI am persuaded you have so far seen that every man by the way\r\nhas received you as his brothers, and has been ready to do you\r\nall the kindness in his power. You will see the same thing quite\r\nto the sea shore; and I wish you, therefore, to go and visit our\r\ngreat cities in that quarter, and see how many friends and brothers\r\nyou have here. You will then have travelled a long line\r\nfrom west to east, and if you had time to go from north to south,\r\nfrom Canada to Florida, you would find it as long in that direction,\r\nand all the people as sincerely your friends. I wish you,\r\nmy children, to see all you can, and to tell your people all you\r\nsee; because I am sure the more they know of us, the more\r\nthey will be our hearty friends. I invite you, therefore, to pay\r\na visit to Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, and the cities still\r\nbeyond that, if you are willing to go further. We will provide\r\ncarriages to convey you and a person to go with you to see that\r\nyou want for nothing. By the time you come back the snows\r\nwill be melted on the mountains, the ice in the rivers broken up,\r\nand you will be wishing to set out on your return home.\r\n\r\nMy children, I have long desired to see you; I have now\r\nopened my heart to you, let my words sink into your hearts and\r\nnever be forgotten. If ever lying people or bad spirits should\r\nraise up clouds between us, call to mind what I have said, and\r\nwhat you have seen yourselves. Be sure there are some lying\r\nspirits between us; let us come together as friends and explain\r\nto each other what is misrepresented or misunderstood, the clouds\r\nwill fly away like morning fog, and the sun of friendship appear\r\nand shine forever bright and clear between us.\r\n\r\nMy children, it may happen that while you are here occasion\r\nmay arise to talk about many things which I do not now particularly\r\nmention. The Secretary at War will always be ready to\r\ntalk with you, and you are to consider whatever he says as said by\r\nmyself. He will also take care of you and see that you are furnished\r\nwith all comforts here.\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, December 31, 1806.\r\n\r\n_To the Chiefs of the Osage nation_:--\r\n\r\n_My Children, Chiefs of the Osage nation_,--I welcome you\r\nsincerely to the seat of the government of the United States.\r\nThe journey you have taken is long and fatiguing, and proved\r\nyour desire to become acquainted with your new brothers of this\r\ncountry. I thank the master of life, who has preserved you by\r\nthe way and brought you safely here. I hope you have found\r\nyourselves, through the whole journey, among brothers and\r\nfriends, who have used you kindly, and convinced you they\r\nwish to live always in peace and harmony with you.\r\n\r\nMy children, your forefathers have doubtless handed it down\r\nto you that in ancient times the French were the fathers of all\r\nthe red men in the country called Louisiana, that is to say, all\r\nthe country on the Mississippi and on all its western waters. In\r\nthe days of your fathers France ceded that country to the Spaniards\r\nand they became your fathers; but six years ago they restored\r\nit to France and France ceded it to us, and we are now\r\nbecome your fathers and brothers; and be assured you will have\r\nno cause to regret the change. It is so long since our forefathers\r\ncame from beyond the great water, that we have lost the\r\nmemory of it, and seem to have grown out of this land as you\r\nhave done. Never more will you have occasion to change your\r\nfathers. We are all now of one family, born in the same land,\r\nand bound to live as brothers, and to have nothing more to do\r\nwith the strangers who live beyond the great water. The Great\r\nSpirit has given you strength and has given us strength, not that\r\nwe should hurt one another, but to do each other all the good\r\nin our power. Our dwellings indeed are very far apart, but not\r\ntoo far to carry on commerce and useful intercourse. You have\r\nfurs and peltries which we want, and we have clothes and other\r\nuseful things which you want. Let us employ ourselves, then,\r\nin making exchanges of these articles useful to both. In order\r\nto prepare ourselves for this commerce with our new children,\r\nwe have found it necessary to send some of our trusty men up\r\nthe different rivers of Louisiana, to see what nations live upon\r\nthem, what number of peltries they can furnish, what quantities\r\nand kinds of merchandize they want, and where are the places\r\nmost convenient to establish trading houses with them. With\r\nthis view we sent a party to the head of the Missouri and the\r\ngreat water beyond that, who are just returned. We sent another\r\nparty up the Red river, and we propose, the ensuing spring, to\r\nsend one up the Arkansas as far as its head. This party will\r\nconsist, like the others, of between twenty and thirty persons.\r\nI shall instruct them to call and see you at your towns, to talk\r\nwith my son the Big Track, who, as well as yourselves and your\r\npeople, will I hope receive them kindly, protect them and give\r\nthem all the information they can as to the people on the same\r\nriver above you. When they return they will be able to tell us\r\nhow we can best establish a trade with you, and how otherwise\r\nwe can be useful to them.\r\n\r\nMy children, I was sorry to learn that a difference had arisen\r\namong the people of your nation, and that a part of them had\r\nseparated and removed to a great distance on the Arkansa. This\r\nis a family quarrel with which I do not pretend to intermeddle.\r\nBoth parties are my children, and I wish equally well to both.\r\nBut it would give me great pleasure if they could again reunite,\r\nbecause a nation, while it holds together, is strong against its\r\nenemies, but, breaking into parts, it is easily destroyed. However\r\nI hope you will at least make friends again, and cherish\r\npeace and brotherly love with one another. If I can be useful\r\nin restoring friendship between you, I shall do it with great\r\npleasure. It is my wish that all my red children live together\r\nas one family, that when differences arise among them, their old\r\nmen should meet together and settle them with justice and in\r\npeace. In this way your women and children will live in safety,\r\nyour nation will increase and be strong.\r\n\r\nAs you have taken so long a journey to see your fathers, we\r\nwish you not to return till you have visited our country and\r\ntowns towards the sea coast. This will be new and satisfactory\r\nto you, and it will give you the same knowledge of the country\r\non this side of the Mississippi, which we are endeavoring to acquire\r\nof that on the other side, by sending trusty persons to explore\r\nthem. We propose to do in your country only what we\r\nare desirous you should do in ours. We will provide accommodations\r\nfor your journey, for your comfort while engaged in it,\r\nand for your return in safety to your own country, carrying with\r\nyou those proofs of esteem with which we distinguish our\r\nfriends, and shall particularly distinguish you. On your return,\r\ntell your chief, the Big Track, and all your people, that I take\r\nthem by the hand, that I become their father hereafter, that they\r\nshall know our nation only as friends and benefactors, that we\r\nhave no views upon them but to carry on a commerce useful to\r\nthem and us, to keep them in peace with their neighbors, that\r\ntheir children may multiply, may grow up and live to a good old\r\nage, and their women no longer fear the tomahawk of any enemy.\r\n\r\nMy children, these are my words, carry them to your nation,\r\nkeep them in your memories and our friendship in your hearts,\r\nand may the Great Spirit look down upon us and cover us with\r\nthe mantle of his love.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n                                                    February 19, 1807.\r\n\r\n_To the Chiefs of the Shawanee Nation_:--\r\n\r\n_My children, Chiefs of the Shawanee nation_,--I have listened\r\nto the speeches of the Blackhoof, Blackbeard, and the other head\r\nchiefs of the Shawanese, and have considered them well. As all\r\nthese speeches relate to the public affairs of your nation, I will\r\nanswer them together.\r\n\r\nYou express a wish to have your lands laid off separately to\r\nyourselves, that you may know what is your own, may have a\r\nfixed place to live on, of which you may not be deprived after\r\nyou shall have built on it, and improved it; you would rather\r\nthat this should be towards Fort Wayne, and to include the three\r\nreserves; you ask a strong writing from us, declaring your right,\r\nand observe that the writing you had was taken from you by\r\nthe Delawares.\r\n\r\nAfter the close of our war with the English, we wished to establish\r\npeace and friendship with our Indian neighbors also. In\r\norder to do this, the first thing necessary was to fix a firm\r\nboundary between them and us, that there might be no trespasses\r\nacross that by either party. Not knowing then what parts on\r\nour border belonged to each Indian nation particularly, we\r\nthought it safest to get all those in the north to join in one\r\ntreaty, and to settle a general boundary line between them and\r\nus. We did not intermeddle as to the lines dividing them one\r\nfrom another, because this was their concern, not ours. We\r\ntherefore met the chiefs of the Wyandots, Delawares, Shawanese,\r\nOttaways, Chippeways, Powtewatamies, Miamis, Eel-Rivers,\r\nWeaks, Kickapoos, Pianteshaws, and Kaskaskies, at Greeneville,\r\nand agreed on a general boundary which was to divide their\r\nlands from those of the whites, making only some particular reserves,\r\nfor the establishment of trade and intercourse with them.\r\nThis treaty was eleven years ago, as Blackbeard has said. Since\r\nthat, some of them have thought it for their advantage to sell us\r\nportions of their lands, which has changed the boundaries in\r\nsome parts; but their rights in the residue remain as they were,\r\nand must always be settled among themselves. If the Shawanese\r\nand Delawares, and their other neighbors, choose to settle the\r\nboundaries between their respective tribes, and to have them\r\nmarked and recorded in our books, we will mark them as they\r\nshall agree among themselves, and will give them strong writings\r\ndeclaring the separate right of each. After which, we will protect\r\neach tribe in its respective lands, as well as against other\r\ntribes who might attempt to take them from them, as against our\r\nown people. The writing which you say the Delawares took\r\nfrom you, must have been the copy of the treaty of Greeneville.\r\nWe will give you another copy to be kept by your nation.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the reserves, you know they were made for\r\nthe purpose of establishing convenient stations for trade and intercourse\r\nwith the tribes within whose boundaries they are.\r\nAnd as circumstances shall render it expedient to make these\r\nestablishments, it is for your interest, as well as ours, that the\r\npossession of these stations should enable us to make them.\r\n\r\nYou complain that Blue-jacket, and a part of your people at\r\nGreeneville, cheat you in the distribution of your annuity, and\r\ntake more of it than their just share. It will be difficult to remedy\r\nthis evil while your nation is living in different settlements.\r\nWe will, however, direct our agent to enquire, and inform us\r\nwhat are your numbers in each of your settlements, and will\r\nthen divide the annuities between the settlements justly, according\r\nto their numbers. And if we can be of any service in bringing\r\nyou all together into one place, we will willingly assist you\r\nfor that purpose. Perhaps your visit to the settlement of your\r\npeople on the Mississippi under the Flute may assist towards\r\ngathering them all into one place from which they may never\r\nagain remove.\r\n\r\nYou say that you like our mode of living, that you wish to\r\nlive as we do, to raise a plenty of food for your children, and to\r\nbring them up in good principles; that you adopt our mode of\r\nliving, and ourselves as your brothers. My children, I rejoice to\r\nhear this; it is the wisest resolution you have ever formed, to\r\nraise corn and domestic animals, by the culture of the earth, and\r\nto let your women spin and weave clothes for you all, instead\r\nof depending for these on hunting. Be assured that half the\r\nlabor and hardships you go through to provide your families by\r\nhunting, with food and clothing, if employed in a farm would\r\nfeed and clothe them better. When the white people first came\r\nto this land, they were few, and you were many: now we are\r\nmany, and you few; and why? because, by cultivating the\r\nearth, we produce plenty to raise our children, while yours,\r\nduring a part of every year, suffer for want of food, are forced to\r\neat unwholesome things, are exposed to the weather in your\r\nhunting camps, get diseases and die. Hence it is that your\r\nnumbers lessen.\r\n\r\nYou ask for instruction in our manner of living, for carpenters\r\nand blacksmiths. My children, you shall have them. We will\r\ndo everything in our power to teach you to take care of your\r\nwives and children, that you may multiply and be strong. We\r\nare sincerely your friends and brothers, we are as unwilling to\r\nsee your blood spilt in war, as our own. Therefore, we encourage\r\nyou to live in peace with all nations, that your women and\r\nchildren may live without danger, and without fear. The greatest\r\nhonor of a man is in doing good to his fellow men, not in\r\ndestroying them. We have placed Mr. Kirk among you, who\r\nwill have other persons under him to teach you how to manage\r\nfarms, and to make clothes for yourselves; and we expect you\r\nwill put some of your young people to work with the carpenters\r\nand smiths we place among you, that they may learn the trades.\r\nIn this way only can you have a number of tradesmen sufficient\r\nfor all your people.\r\n\r\nYou wish me to name to you the person authorized to speak\r\nto you in our name, that you may know whom to believe, and\r\nnot be deceived by impostors. My children, Governor Harrison\r\nis the person we authorize to talk to you in our name. You\r\nmay depend on his advice, and that it comes from us. He stands\r\nbetween you and us, to convey with truth whatever either of us\r\nwishes to say to the other.\r\n\r\nMy children, I wish you a safe return to your friends and\r\nfamilies, that you may retain your resolution of learning to live\r\nin our way, that it may give health and comfort to your families,\r\nand add members to your nation. In me you will always\r\nfind a sincere and true friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n                                        WASHINGTON, February 27, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To Kitchao Geboway_:--\r\n\r\n_My son Kitchao Geboway_,--I have received the speech which\r\nyou sent me through General Gansevoort from Albany on the 13th\r\nof this month, and now return you my answer. It would have\r\ngiven me great pleasure to have been able to converse with and\r\nunderstand you, when you visited me at Washington; but the\r\nwant of an interpreter rendered that impossible.\r\n\r\nMy son, tell your nation, the Chippewas, that I take them by\r\nthe hand, and consider them as a part of the great family of the\r\nUnited States, which extends to the great Lakes and the Lake\r\nof the Woods, northwardly, and from the rising to the setting\r\nsun; that the United States wish to live in peace with them, to\r\nconsider them as a part of themselves, to establish a commerce\r\nwith them, as advantageous to the Chippewas as they can make\r\nit, and in all cases to render them every service in our power.\r\nWe shall never ask them to enter into our quarrels, nor to spill\r\ntheir blood in fighting our enemies. My son, in visiting this\r\nquarter of the United States, you have seen a part of our country,\r\nand some of our people from East to West. If you had travelled\r\nalso from North to South, you would have seen it the\r\nsame. You see that we are as numerous as the leaves of the\r\ntrees, that we are strong enough to fight our own battles, and\r\ntoo strong to fear any enemy. When, therefore, we wish you\r\nto live in peace with all people, red and white, we wish it because\r\nit is for your good, and because it is our desire that your\r\nwomen and children shall live in safety, not fearing the tomahawk\r\nof any enemy, that they may learn to raise food enough\r\nto support their families, and that your nation may multiply and\r\nbe strong. If any white men advise you to go to war for them,\r\nit is a proof they are too weak to defend themselves, that they\r\nare in truth your enemies, wishing to sacrifice you to save themselves;\r\nand when they shall be driven away, my son, what is to\r\nbecome of the red men who may join in their battles? Take\r\nthe advice then of a father, and meddle not in the quarrels of\r\nthe white people, should any war take place between them; but\r\nstay at home in peace, taking care of your wives and children.\r\nIn that case not a hair of your heads shall be touched. Never\r\nwill we do you an injury unprovoked, or disturb you in your\r\ntowns or lands by any violence.\r\n\r\nMy son, I confirm everything which your father, Governor\r\nHall, said to you at Detroit on my part: and in all your difficulties\r\nand dangers apply to him, and take his advice. If some\r\nof your principal chiefs will pay me a visit at Washington, I\r\nshall be very happy to receive them, to smoke the pipe of friendship\r\nwith them, to take them by the hand and never to let go\r\ntheir friendship. They shall see that I want nothing from them\r\nbut their good will, and to do them all the good in my power.\r\n\r\nMy son, the Secretary at War will comply with your request\r\nin giving you a chief's coat with epaulettes, and a stand of the\r\ncolors of the United States, to plant in your town, to let all the\r\nworld see that you are a part of the family of the United States.\r\n\r\nMy son, I wish you a pleasant journey, and a safe return to\r\nyour family and friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV.\r\n\r\n                                           WASHINGTON, April 22, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Chiefs of the Ottawas, Chippewas, Powtewattamies, Wyandots,\r\nand Senecas of Sandusky_:--\r\n\r\n_My Children_,--I received your message of July last, and I am\r\nglad of the opportunity it gives me of explaining to you the sentiments\r\nof the government of the United States towards you.\r\n\r\nMany among you must remember the time when we were\r\ngoverned by the British nation, and the war by which we separated\r\nourselves from them. Your old men must remember also\r\nthat while we were under that government we were constantly\r\nkept at war with the red men our neighbors. Many of these\r\ntook side in the English war against us; so that after we had\r\nmade peace with the English, ill blood remained between us for\r\nsome time; and it was not till the treaty of Greeneville that we\r\ncould come to a solid peace and perfect good understanding with\r\nall our Indian neighbors. This being once done and fixed lines\r\ndrawn between them and us, laying off their lands to themselves,\r\nand ours to ourselves, so that each might know their own, and\r\nnothing disturb our future peace, we have from that moment,\r\nmy children, looked upon you heartily as our brothers, and as a\r\npart of ourselves. We saw that your game was becoming too\r\nscarce to support you, and that unless we could persuade you to\r\ncultivate the earth, to raise the tame animals, and to spin and\r\nweave clothes for yourselves as we do, you would disappear from\r\nthe earth. To encourage you, therefore, to save yourselves has\r\nbeen our constant object; and we have hoped that the day would\r\ncome when every man among you would have his own farm\r\nlaid off to himself as we have, would maintain his family by\r\nlabor as we do, and would make one people with us. But in all\r\nthese things you have been free to do as you please; your lands\r\nare your own; your right to them shall never be violated by us;\r\nthey are yours to keep or to sell as you please. Whenever you\r\nfind it your interest to dispose of a part to enable you to improve\r\nthe rest, and to support your families in the meantime, we are\r\nwilling to buy, because our people increase fast. When a want\r\nof land in a particular place induces us to ask you to sell, still\r\nyou are always free to say \"No,\" and it will never disturb our\r\nfriendship for you. We will never be angry with others for\r\nexercising their own rights according to what they think their\r\nown interests. You say you were told at Swan's Creek, that if\r\nyou would not let us have lands, we should be angry with you,\r\nand would force you. Those, my children, who told you so,\r\nsaid what was false, and what never had been said or thought\r\nof by us. We never meant to control your free will; we never\r\nwill do it. I will explain to you the ground of our late application\r\nto you for lands. You know that the posts of Detroit and\r\nMacinac have very little lands belonging to them. It is for\r\nyour interest as well as ours that these posts should be maintained\r\nfor the purposes of our trade with one another. We were\r\ndesirous therefore to purchase as much land around them as\r\nwould enable us to have sufficient settlements there to support\r\nthe posts; and that this might be so laid off as to join with our\r\npossessions on Lake Erie. But we expressly instructed our beloved\r\nman, Governor Hall, not to press you beyond your own convenience,\r\nnor to buy more than you would spare with good will.\r\nHe accordingly left you to your own inclinations, using no\r\nthreats whatever, as you tell me in your message. You agreed\r\nto let us have a part of what we wished to buy. We are contented\r\nwith it my children. We find no fault with you for\r\nwhat you did not do, but thank you for what you did.\r\n\r\nYou complain, my children, that your annuities are not regularly\r\npaid, that the goods delivered you are often bad in kind, that\r\nthey sometimes arrive damaged, and are dear, and that you would\r\nrather receive them in money. You shall have them in money.\r\nWe had no interest in laying out your money in goods for you.\r\n\r\nIt cost us considerable trouble in the purchase and transportation,\r\nand as we could not be everywhere with them to take care\r\nof them ourselves, we could not prevent their being injured sometimes\r\nby accident, sometimes by carelessness. To pay money\r\ntherefore, is more convenient to us, and as it will please you better,\r\nit shall be done.\r\n\r\nI am now, my children, to address you on a very serious subject,\r\none which greatly concerns your happiness. Open your\r\nears, therefore, let my words sink deeply into your bosoms, and\r\nnever forget them. For be assured that I will not, and that I\r\nwill fulfil them to their uttermost import. We have for sometime\r\nhad a misunderstanding with the English, and we do not\r\nyet know whether it will end in peace or in war. But in either\r\ncase, my children, do you remain quiet at home, taking no part\r\nin these quarrels. We do not wish you to shed your blood in\r\nour battles. We are able to fight them ourselves. And if others\r\npress you to take part against us, it is because they are weak,\r\nnot able to protect themselves nor you. Consider well then\r\nwhat you do. Since we have freed ourselves from the English\r\ngovernment, and made our peace with our Indian neighbors, we\r\nhave cultivated that peace with sincerity and affection. We\r\nhave done them such favors as were in our power, and promoted\r\ntheir interest and peace wherever we could. We consider them\r\nnow as a part of ourselves, and we look to their welfare as our\r\nown. But if there be among you any nation whom no benefits\r\ncan attach, no good offices on our part can convert into faithful\r\nfriends, if relinquishing their permanent connection with us for\r\nthe fugitive presents or promises of others, they shall prefer our\r\nenmity to our friendship, and engage in war against us, that nation\r\nmust abandon forever the land of their fathers. No nation\r\nrejecting our friendship, and commencing wanton and unprovoked\r\nwar against us, shall ever after remain within our reach;\r\nit shall never be in their power to strike us a second time. These\r\nwords, my children, may appear harsh; but they are spoken in\r\nkindness; they are intended to warn you beforehand of the ruin\r\ninto which those will rush, who shall once break the chain of\r\nfriendship with us. You know they are not spoken from fear.\r\nWe fear no nation. We love yours. We wish you to live forever\r\nin peace with all men, and in brotherly affection with us;\r\nto be with us as one family; to take care of your women and\r\nchildren, feed and clothe them well, multiply and be strong with\r\nyour friends and your enemies.\r\n\r\nMy children, I salute you with fatherly concern for your welfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n                                                          May 4, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Chiefs of the Upper Cherokees_:--\r\n\r\n_My Children, Chiefs of the Upper Cherokees_,--I am glad\r\nto see you at the seat of government, to take you by the hand,\r\nand to assure you in person of the friendship of the United\r\nStates towards all their red children, and of their desire to extend,\r\nto them all, their protection of good offices. The journey\r\nyou have come is a long one, and the object expressed in\r\nour conference of the other day is important. I have listened\r\nto it with attention, and given it the consideration it deserves.\r\nYou complain that you do not receive your just proportion of the\r\nannuities we pay your nation; that the chiefs of the lower towns\r\ntake for them more than their share. My children, this distribution\r\nis made by the authority of the Cherokee nation, and according\r\nto their own rules over which we have no control. We\r\ndo our duty in delivering the annuities to the head men of the\r\nnation, and we pretend to no authority over them, to no right of\r\ndirecting how they are to be distributed. But we will instruct\r\nour agent, Colonel Meigs, to exhort the chiefs to do justice to all\r\nthe parts of their nation in the distribution of these annuities,\r\nand to endeavor that every town shall have its due share. We\r\nwould willingly pay these annuities in money, which could be\r\nmore equally divided, if the nation would prefer that, and if we\r\ncan be assured that the money will not be laid out in strong\r\ndrink instead of necessaries for your wives and children. We\r\nwish to do whatever will best secure your people from suffering\r\nfor want of clothes or food. It is these wants which bring\r\nsickness and death into your families, and prevent you from multiplying\r\nas we do. In answer to your question relating to the\r\nlands we have purchased from your nation at different times, I\r\ninform you that the payments have for the most part been made\r\nin money, which has been left, as the annuities are, to the discharge\r\nof your debts, and to distribute according to the rules of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nYou propose, my children, that your nation shall be divided\r\ninto two, and that your part, the upper Cherokees, shall be separated\r\nfrom the lower by a fixed boundary, shall be placed under\r\nthe government of the United States, become citizens thereof,\r\nand be ruled by our laws; in fine, to be our brothers instead of\r\nour children. My children, I shall rejoice to see the day when\r\nthe red men, our neighbors, become truly one people with us,\r\nenjoying all the rights and privileges we do, and living in peace\r\nand plenty as we do, without any one to make them afraid, to\r\ninjure their persons, or to take their property without being punished\r\nfor it according to fixed laws. But are you prepared for\r\nthis? Have you the resolution to leave off hunting for your living,\r\nto lay off a farm for each family to itself, to live by industry,\r\nthe men working that farm with their hands, raising stock,\r\nor learning trades as we do, and the women spinning and weaving\r\nclothes for their husbands and children? All this is necessary\r\nbefore our laws can suit you or be of any use to you. However,\r\nlet your people take this matter into consideration. If they\r\nthink themselves prepared for becoming citizens of the United\r\nStates, for living in subjection to laws and under their protection\r\nas we do, let them consult the lower towns, come with them to\r\nan agreement of separation by a fixed boundary, and send to this\r\nplace a few of the chiefs they have most confidence in, with\r\npowers to arrange with us regulations concerning the protection\r\nof their persons, punishment of crimes, assigning to each family\r\ntheir separate farms, directing how these shall go to the family\r\nas they die one after another, in what manner they shall be\r\ngoverned, and all other particulars necessary for their happiness\r\nin their new condition. On our part I will ask the assistance of\r\nour great council, the Congress, whose authority is necessary to\r\ngive validity to these arrangements, and who wish nothing more\r\nsincerely than to render your condition secure and happy.\r\nShould the principal part of your people determine to adopt this\r\nalteration, and a smaller part still choose to continue the hunter's\r\nlife, it may facilitate the settlement among yourselves to be told\r\nthat we will give to those leave to go, if they choose it, and settle\r\non our lands beyond the Mississippi, where some Cherokees\r\nare already settled, and where game is plenty, and we will take\r\nmeasures for establishing a store there among them, where they\r\nmay obtain necessaries in exchange for their peltries, and we\r\nwill still continue to be their friends there as much as here.\r\n\r\nMy children, carry these words to your people, advise with\r\nColonel Meigs in your proceedings, ask him to inform me from\r\ntime to time how you go on, and I will further advise you in what\r\nmay be necessary. Tell your people I take them all by the\r\nhand; that I leave them free to do as they choose, and that whatever\r\nchoice they make, I will still be their friend and father.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n                                                          May 5, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To Colonel Louis Cook and Jacob Francis of the St. Regis Indians_:--\r\n\r\n_My Children_,--I take you by the hand, and all the people of\r\nSt. Regis within the limits of the United States, and I desire to\r\nspeak to them through you. A great misunderstanding has taken\r\nplace between the English and the United States, and although\r\nwe desire to live in peace with all the world and unmolested, yet\r\nit is not quite certain whether this difference will end in peace or\r\nwar. Should war take place, do you, my children, remain at home\r\nin peace, taking care of your wives and children. You have no\r\nconcern in our quarrel, take therefore no part in it. We do not\r\nwish you to spill your blood in our battles. We can fight them\r\nourselves. Say the same to your red brethren everywhere, let\r\nthem remain neutral and quiet, and we will never disturb them.\r\nShould the English insist on their taking up the hatchet against\r\nus, if they choose rather to break up their settlements and come\r\nover to live in peace with us, we will find other settlements for\r\nthem, and they shall become our children. The red nations\r\nwho shall remain in peace with the United States, shall forever\r\nfind them true friends and fathers. Those who commence\r\nagainst them an unprovoked war, must expect their lasting enmity.\r\n\r\nMy children, I wish you well, and a safe return to your own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.\r\n\r\n                                         WASHINGTON, December 2, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Delaware Chief, Captain Armstrong_:--\r\n\r\nI have received your letter of October 20th, wherein you\r\nexpress a wish to obtain a deed for the thirteen sections of lands\r\nreserved for the Delawares in the State of Ohio, by an act of\r\nCongress. I accordingly now send you an authentic deed designating\r\nthe thirteen sections, and signed by the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, who was authorized for this purpose by the act of\r\nCongress. Under this you are free to settle on the lands when\r\nyou please, and to occupy them according to your own rules.\r\nYou cannot, indeed, sell them to the white citizens of the United\r\nStates. Knowing how liable you would be to be cheated and\r\ndeceived, were we to permit our citizens to purchase your lands,\r\nour government acting as your friends and patrons, and desirous\r\nof guarding your interests against the frauds that would surround\r\nyou, does not permit white persons to purchase your lands from\r\nyou. In every other way they are yours, free to be used as you\r\nplease; and their possession will be protected and guaranteed to\r\nyou by the United States. I salute you and my children, the\r\nDelawares, with friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII.\r\n\r\n                                                    December 21, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To the Miamis, Powtewatamies, Delawares and Chippeways._\r\n\r\n_My Children_:--Some of you are old enough to remember,\r\nand the youngest have heard from their fathers, that the country\r\nwas formerly governed by the English. While they governed\r\nit there were constant wars between the white and the red people.\r\nTo such a height was the hatred of both parties carried\r\nthat they thought it no crime to kill one another in cold blood\r\nwhenever they had an opportunity. This spirit led many of\r\nthe Indians to take side against us in the war; and at the close\r\nof it the English made peace for themselves, and left the Indians\r\nto get out of it as well as they could. It was not till twelve\r\nyears after that we were able by the treaty of Greeneville to close\r\nour wars with all our red neighbors. From that moment, my\r\nchildren, the policy of this country towards you has been entirely\r\nchanged. General Washington, our first President, began a line\r\nof just and friendly conduct towards you. Mr. Adams, the\r\nsecond, continued it; and from the moment I came into the administration\r\nI have looked upon you with the same good will as\r\nmy own fellow citizens, have considered your interests as our\r\ninterests, and peace and friendship as a blessing to us all. Seeing\r\nwith sincere regret that your people were wasting away, believing\r\nthat this proceeded from your frequent wars, and the\r\ndestructive use of spirituous liquors, and scanty supplies of food,\r\nI have inculcated peace with all your neighbors, have endeavored\r\nto prevent the introduction of spirituous liquors among you, and\r\npressed on you to rely for food on the culture of the earth more than\r\non hunting. On the contrary, my children, the English persuade\r\nyou to hunt, they supply you with spirituous liquors, and are now\r\nendeavoring to engage you to join them in the war against us,\r\nshould a war take place. You possess reason, my children, as we\r\ndo, and you will judge for yourselves which of us advise you as\r\nfriends. The course they advise has worn you down to your present\r\nnumbers, but temperance, peace and agriculture will raise you\r\nup to be what your forefathers were, will prepare you to possess\r\nproperty, to wish to live under regular laws, to join us in our\r\ngovernment, to mix with us in society, and your blood and ours\r\nunited will spread again over the great island.\r\n\r\nMy children, this is the last time I shall speak to you as your\r\nfather, it is the last counsel I shall give. I am now too old to\r\nwatch over the extensive concerns of the seventeen States and\r\ntheir territories. I have, therefore, requested my fellow citizens\r\nto permit me to retire, to live with my family and to choose\r\nanother chief and another father for you, and in a short time I\r\nshall retire and resign into his hands the care of your and our\r\nconcerns. Be assured, my children, that he will have the same\r\nfriendly disposition towards you which I have had, and that you\r\nwill find in him a true and affectionate father. Entertain, therefore,\r\nno uneasiness on account of this change, for there will be\r\nno change as to you. Indeed, my children, this is now the disposition\r\ntowards you of all our people. They look upon you as\r\nbrethren, born in the same land, and having the same interests.\r\nIn your journey to this place you have seen many of them. I\r\nam certain they have received you as brothers and been ready to\r\nshow you every kindness. You will see the same on the road\r\nby which you will return; and were you to pass from north to\r\nsouth, or east to west in any part of the United States, you would\r\nfind yourselves always among friends. Tell this, therefore, to\r\nyour people on your return home, assure them that no change\r\nwill ever take place in our dispositions towards them; deliver to\r\nthem my adieux and my prayers to the Great Spirit for their happiness,\r\ntell them that during my administration I have held their\r\nhand fast in mine, that I will put it into the hand of their new\r\nfather, who will hold it as I have done.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX.\r\n\r\n_To Little Turtle, Chief of the Miamis_:--\r\n\r\n_My Son_,--It is always with pleasure that I receive you here\r\nand take you by the hand, and that to the assurances of friendship\r\nto your nation I can add those of my personal respect and\r\nesteem for you. Our confidence in your friendship has been the\r\nstronger, as your enlarged understanding could not fail to see the\r\nadvantages resulting to your nation as well as to us from a mutual\r\ngood understanding. We ask nothing from them but their\r\npeace and good will, and it is a sincere solicitude for their welfare\r\nwhich has induced us, from time to time, to warn them of\r\nthe decay of their nation by continuing to rely on the chase for\r\nfood, after the deer and buffalo are become too scanty to subsist\r\nthem, and to press them before they are reduced too low, to begin\r\nthe culture of the earth and the raising of domestic animals.\r\nA little of their land in corn and cattle will feed them much better\r\nthan the whole of it in deer and buffalo, in their present\r\nscarce state, and they will be scarcer every year. I have, therefore,\r\nalways believed it an act of friendship to our red brethren\r\nwhenever they wished to sell a portion of their lands, to be ready\r\nto buy whether we wanted them or not, because the price enables\r\nthem to improve the lands they retain, and turning their industry\r\nfrom hunting to agriculture, the same exertions will support\r\nthem more plentifully.\r\n\r\nYou inform me, my son, that your nation claims all the land\r\non the Wabash and the Miami of the Lake and their waters, and\r\nthat a small portion of that which was sold to us by the Ottaways,\r\nWyandots, and other tribes of Michigan belonged to you.\r\nMy son, it is difficult for us to know the exact boundaries which\r\ndivide the lands of the several Indian tribes, and indeed it appears\r\noften that they do not know themselves, or cannot agree\r\nabout them. I have long thought it desirable that they should\r\nsettle their boundaries with one another, and let them be written\r\non paper and preserved by them and by us, to prevent disputes\r\namong themselves. The tribes who made that sale certainly\r\nclaim the lands on both sides of the Miami, some distance up\r\nfrom the mouth, as they have since granted us two roads from\r\nthe rapids to the Miami, the one eastwardly to the line of the\r\ntreaty of Fort Industry, and the other south eastwardly to the\r\nline of the treaty of Greeneville. I observe, moreover, that in\r\nthe late conveyance of lands on the White River branch of the\r\nWabash, to the Delawares, the Powtewatamies join you in the\r\nconveyance, which is an acknowledgment that all the lands on\r\nthe waters of the Wabash do not belong to the Miamis alone.\r\nIf, however, the Ottaways and others who sold to us had no\r\nright themselves, they could convey none to us, and we acknowledge\r\nwe cannot acquire lands by buying them of those who have\r\nno title themselves. This question cannot be determined here,\r\nwhere we have no means of inquiring from those who have\r\nknowledge of the facts. We will instruct Governor Hull to collect\r\nthe evidence from both parties, and from others, and to report\r\nit to us. And if it shall appear that the lands belonged to\r\nyou and not to those who sold them, be assured we will do you\r\nfull justice. We ask your friendship and confidence no longer\r\nthan we shall merit it by our justice. On this subject, therefore,\r\nmy son, your mind may be tranquil. You have an opportunity\r\nof producing before Governor Hull all the evidences of your\r\nright, and they shall be fairly weighed against the opposite\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\nMy son, I salute your nation with constant friendship, and assure\r\nyou of my particular esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nXX.\r\n\r\n_To Manchol, the great War Chief of the Powtewatamies_:--\r\n\r\n_My Son_,--I am happy to receive you at the seat of Government\r\nof the United States, to take you and your nation by the\r\nhand, and to welcome you to this place. It has long been my\r\ndesire to see the distinguished men of the Powtewatamies, and\r\nto give them the same assurances of friendship and good will\r\nwhich I have given to all my other red children. I wish to see\r\nthem living in plenty and prosperity, beginning to cultivate the\r\nearth and raise domestic animals for their comfortable subsistence.\r\nIn this way they will raise up young people in abundance\r\nto succeed to the old, and to keep their nation strong. For this\r\nreason I recommend to them to live in peace with all men, and\r\nnot, by destroying one another, to make the whole race of red\r\nmen disappear from the land.\r\n\r\nYou say, my son, that you have engaged in a war with the\r\nOsages, and that the war club is now in your hand for that purpose;\r\nbut you do not tell me for what cause you are waging\r\nwar with the Osages. I have never heard that they have crossed\r\nthe Mississippi and attacked your villages, killed your women\r\nand children, or destroyed the game on your lands. What is the\r\ninjury then which they have done you and for which you wish\r\nto cross the Mississippi and to destroy them? If they have done\r\nyou no wrong, have you a right to make war upon innocent and\r\nunoffending people? Be assured that the Great Spirit will not\r\napprove of this,--He did not make men strong that they might\r\ndestroy all other men. If your young people think that in this\r\nway they will acquire honor as great warriors, they are mistaken.\r\nNobody can acquire honor by doing what is wrong.\r\n\r\nYou say, my son, that it is not the wish of my red children\r\nto meddle in the wars between the whites, nor that we should\r\nmeddle in the wars among our red children. If your wars in no\r\nwise affect our rights, or our relations with those on whom you\r\nmake war, we do not meddle with them but by way of advice,\r\nas your father and friend submitting it to your own consideration.\r\nBut my son, your war parties cannot pass from your towns to\r\nthe country of the Osages, nor can the Osages come to revenge\r\nthemselves on your towns without traversing extensively a country\r\nwhich is ours. They must cross the Mississippi which is\r\nalways covered with our boats, our people and property. All\r\nthe produce of the western parts of Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky,\r\nOhio, Indiana, Tennessee, and Louisiana, goes down the\r\nriver Mississippi to New Orleans. It cannot be indifferent to us\r\nthat this should be exposed to danger from unruly young men\r\ngoing to war. Our interests require that the Mississippi shall\r\nbe a river of peace, not to be crossed by men seeking to shed\r\nblood. We have a right then to say that no war parties shall\r\ncross our river or our country without our consent. The Sacs\r\nand Foxes, besides the country from the Illinois to the Wisconsin\r\non the east side of the Mississippi, ceded to us the country\r\non the west side of the Mississippi, between that river and\r\nthe Missouri, for about one hundred miles up each. The Osages\r\nhave ceded to us all the country from the south side of the Missouri\r\nto the Arkansas, more than two hundred miles up each\r\nriver. Surely, my son, we are justifiable in so far meddling\r\nwith your wars as to say that, in carrying them on neither the\r\nOsages nor you must cross that country which is ours, to get at\r\none another, and in doing so to endanger our people and our\r\nproperty, and to stain our land with blood; and friendship requires\r\nthat we should give you this warning.\r\n\r\nMy son, I wish you to consider this subject maturely, and to\r\ntell your nation that I request them to consider it also. I am\r\nready to do them every favor in my power, and to give them\r\nevery aid, but not aids to carry war across our territory. Do\r\nnot suppose that in refusing this I am not your friend. If I were\r\nyour enemy, what could I do better than to encourage you in\r\ntomahawking one another till not a man should be left. Neither\r\nmust you suppose this to proceed from partiality to the Osages.\r\nYou are nearer to me than the Osages, and on that account I\r\nshould be more ready to do you good offices. But my desire to\r\nkeep you in peace arises from my sincere wish to see you happy\r\nand prosperous, increasing in numbers, supplying your families\r\nplentifully with food and clothing, and relieving them from the\r\nconstant chance of being destroyed by their enemies.\r\n\r\nMy son, the Secretary at War will give to you those tokens of\r\nour good will by which we manifest our friendship to the distinguished\r\nmen among our red children who visit us. Be assured\r\nthat I shall set a great value on your friendship; and convey\r\nfor me to your nation assurances that I wish nothing more\r\nthan their welfare. You shall return by the way of Baltimore\r\nand Philadelphia as you desire. I wish you to see as many of\r\nyour brothers of the United States as you can. You will find\r\nthem all to be your friends, and that they will receive you hospitably.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI.\r\n\r\n                                                    December 21, 1808.\r\n\r\n_To Beaver, the head warrior of the Delawares_:--\r\n\r\n_My Son_,--I am glad to see you here to take you by the hand.\r\nI am the friend of your nation, and sincerely wish them well.\r\nI shall now speak to them as their friend, and advise them for\r\ntheir good.\r\n\r\nI have read your speech to the Secretary at War, and considered\r\nit maturely. You therein say that after the conclusion\r\nof the treaty of Greenville, the Wapanakies and other tribes of\r\nIndians mutually agreed to maintain peace among themselves\r\nand with the United States. This, my son, was wise, and I\r\nentirely approve of it. And I equally commend you for what\r\nyou further say, that yours and the other tribes have constantly\r\nmaintained the articles of peace with us, and have ceased to\r\nlisten to bad advice. I hope, my son, that you will continue in\r\nthis good line of conduct, and I assure you the United States\r\nwill forever religiously observe the treaty on their part, not only\r\nbecause they have agreed to it, but because they esteem you;\r\nthey wish you well, and would endeavor to promote your welfare\r\neven if there were no treaty; and rejoicing that you have\r\nceased to listen to bad advice, they hope you will listen to that\r\nwhich is good.\r\n\r\nMy son, you say that the Osage nation has refused to be at\r\npeace with your nation or any others; that they have refused\r\nthe offers of peace, and extended their aggressions to all people.\r\nThis is all new to me. I never heard of an Osage coming to\r\nwar on this side of the Mississippi. Have they attacked your\r\ntowns, killed your people, or destroyed your game? Tell me in\r\nwhat year they did this? or what is the aggression they have\r\ncommitted on yours and the other tribes on this side the Mississippi?\r\nBut if they have defended themselves and their country,\r\nwhen your tribes have gone over to destroy them, they have\r\nonly done what brave men ought to do, and what just men\r\nought never to have forced them to do. Your having committed\r\none wrong on them gives you no right to commit a second; and\r\nbe assured, my son, that the Almighty Spirit which is above will\r\nnot look down with indifference on your going to war against\r\nhis children on the other side the Mississippi, who have never\r\ncome to attack you. He is their father as well as your father,\r\nand He did not make the Osages to be destroyed by you. I tell\r\nyou that if you make war unjustly on the Osages, He will punish\r\nyour nation for it. He will send upon your nation famine, sickness,\r\nor the tomahawk of a stronger nation, who will cut you off\r\nfrom the land. Consider this thing well, then, before it is too\r\nlate, and before you strike. His hand is uplifted over your\r\nheads, and His stroke will follow yours. My son, I tell you\r\nthese things because I wish your nation well. I wish them to\r\nbecome a peaceable, prosperous, and happy nation; and if this\r\nwar against the Osages concerned yourselves alone, I would confine\r\nmyself to giving you advice, and leave it to yourselves to\r\nprofit by it. But this war deeply concerns the United States.\r\nBetween you and the Osages is a country of many hundred\r\nmiles extent belonging to the United States. Between you also\r\nis the Mississippi, the river of peace. On this river are floating\r\nthe boats, the people, and all the produce of the western States\r\nof the Union. This commerce must not be exposed to the\r\nalarm of war parties crossing the river, nor must a path of blood\r\nbe made across our country. What we say to you, my son, we\r\nsay also to the Osages. We tell them that armed bands of warriors,\r\nentering on the lands or waters of the United States without\r\nour consent, are the enemies of the United States. If, therefore,\r\nconsiderations of your own welfare are not sufficient to restrain\r\nyou from this unauthorized war, let me warn you on the\r\npart of the United States to respect their rights, not to violate\r\ntheir territory.\r\n\r\nYou request, my son, to be informed of our warfares, that you\r\nmay be enabled to inform your nation on your return. We are\r\nyet at peace, and shall continue so, if the injustice of the other\r\nnations will permit us. The war beyond the water is universal.\r\nWe wish to keep it out of our island. But should we go to war,\r\nwe wish our red children to take no part in it. We are able to\r\nfight our own battles, and we know that our red children cannot\r\nafford to spill their blood in our quarrels. Therefore, we do not\r\nask it, but wish them to remain home in quiet, taking care of\r\nthemselves and their families.\r\n\r\nYou complain that the white people in your neighborhood\r\nhave stolen a number of your horses. My son, the Secretary of\r\nWar will take measures for inquiring into the truth of this, and\r\nif it so appears, justice shall be done you.\r\n\r\nThe two swords which you ask shall be given to you; and\r\nwe shall be happy to give you every other proof that we esteem\r\nyou personally, my son, and shall always be ready to do anything\r\nwhich may advance your comfort and happiness. I hope\r\nyou will deliver to your nation the words I have spoken to you,\r\nand assure them that in everything which can promote their\r\nwelfare and prosperity they shall ever find me their true and\r\nfaithful friend and father, that I hold them fast by the hand of\r\nfriendship, which I hope they will not force me to let go.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII.\r\n\r\n_To Captain Hendrick, the Delawares, Mohiccons, and Munries_:--\r\n\r\n_My Son and my Children_,--I am glad to see you here to receive\r\nyour salutations, and to return them by taking you by the\r\nhand, and renewing to you the assurances of my friendship. I\r\nlearn with pleasure that the Miamis and Powtawatamies have\r\ngiven you some of their lands on the White River to live on,\r\nand that you propose to gather there your scattered tribes, and\r\nto dwell on it all your days.\r\n\r\nThe picture which you have drawn, my son, of the increase\r\nof our numbers and the decrease of yours is just, the causes are\r\nvery plain, and the remedy depends on yourselves alone. You\r\nhave lived by hunting the deer and buffalo--all these have been\r\ndriven westward; you have sold out on the sea-board and moved\r\nwestwardly in pursuit of them. As they became scarce there,\r\nyour food has failed you; you have been a part of every year\r\nwithout food, except the roots and other unwholesome things you\r\ncould find in the forest. Scanty and unwholesome food produce\r\ndiseases and death among your children, and hence you have\r\nraised few and your numbers have decreased. Frequent wars,\r\ntoo, and the abuse of spirituous liquors, have assisted in lessening\r\nyour numbers. The whites, on the other hand, are in the habit\r\nof cultivating the earth, of raising stocks of cattle, hogs, and\r\nother domestic animals, in much greater numbers than they could\r\nkill of deer and buffalo. Having always a plenty of food and\r\nclothing they raise abundance of children, they double their\r\nnumbers every twenty years, the new swarms are continually\r\nadvancing upon the country like flocks of pigeons, and so they\r\nwill continue to do. Now, my children, if we wanted to diminish\r\nour numbers, we would give up the culture of the earth, pursue\r\nthe deer and buffalo, and be always at war; this would soon\r\nreduce us to be as few as you are, and if you wish to increase\r\nyour numbers you must give up the deer and buffalo, live in\r\npeace, and cultivate the earth. You see then, my children, that\r\nit depends on yourselves alone to become a numerous and great\r\npeople. Let me entreat you, therefore, on the lands now given\r\nyou to begin to give every man a farm; let him enclose it, cultivate\r\nit, build a warm house on it, and when he dies, let it belong\r\nto his wife and children after him. Nothing is so easy as\r\nto learn to cultivate the earth; all your women understand it,\r\nand to make it easier, we are always ready to teach you how to\r\nmake ploughs, hoes, and necessary utensils. If the men will\r\ntake the labor of the earth from the women they will learn to\r\nspin and weave and to clothe their families. In this way\r\nyou will also raise many children, you will double your numbers\r\nevery twenty years, and soon fill the land your friends have\r\ngiven you, and your children will never be tempted to sell the\r\nspot on which they have been born, raised, have labored and\r\ncalled their own. When once you have property, you will want\r\nlaws and magistrates to protect your property and persons, and\r\nto punish those among you who commit crimes. You will find\r\nthat our laws are good for this purpose; you will wish to live\r\nunder them, you will unite yourselves with us, join in our great\r\ncouncils and form one people with us, and we shall all be Americans;\r\nyou will mix with us by marriage, your blood will run in\r\nour veins, and will spread with us over this great island. Instead,\r\nthen, my children, of the gloomy prospect you have drawn\r\nof your total disappearance from the face of the earth, which is\r\ntrue, if you continue to hunt the deer and buffalo and go to war,\r\nyou see what a brilliant aspect is offered to your future history,\r\nif you give up war and hunting. Adopt the culture of the earth\r\nand raise domestic animals; you see how from a small family\r\nyou may become a great nation by adopting the course which\r\nfrom the small beginning you describe has made us a great\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nMy children, I will give you a paper declaring your right to\r\nhold, against all persons, the lands given you by the Miamis and\r\nPowtewatamies, and that you never can sell them without their\r\nconsent. But I must tell you that if ever they and you agree to\r\nsell, no paper which I can give you can prevent your doing what\r\nyou please with your own. The only way to prevent this is to\r\ngive to every one of your people a farm, which shall belong to\r\nhim and his family, and which the nation shall have no right to\r\ntake from them and sell; in this way alone can you ensure the\r\nlands to your descendants through all generations, and that it\r\nshall never be sold from under their feet. It is not the keeping\r\nyour lands which will keep your people alive on them after the\r\ndeer and buffalo shall have left them; it is the cultivating them\r\nalone which can do that. The hundredth part in corn and cattle\r\nwill support you better than the whole in deer and buffalo.\r\n\r\nMy son Hendrick, deliver these words to your people. I have\r\nspoken to them plainly, that they may see what is before them,\r\nand that it is in their own power to go on dwindling to nothing,\r\nor to become again a great people. It is for this reason I wish\r\nthem to live in peace with all people, to teach their young men\r\nto love agriculture, rather than war and hunting. Let these\r\nwords sink deep in their hearts, and let them often repeat them\r\nand consider them. Tell them that I hold them fast by the\r\nhand, and that I will ever be their friend to advise and to assist\r\nthem in following the true path to their future happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII.\r\n\r\n_To Kitchao Geboway_:--\r\n\r\n_My Son_,--I am happy to receive your visit at the seat of our\r\ngovernment, and to repeat to you the assurances of my friendly\r\ndispositions towards your nation. I am the more pleased to see\r\nyou again, as at your last visit we could not converse together\r\nfor want of an interpreter. This difficulty is now removed by\r\nthe presence of Mr. Ryley. I approve of your disposition, my\r\nson, to live at peace with all the world. It is what we wish all\r\nour red children to do, and to consider themselves as brethren of\r\nthe same family, and forming with us but one nation. The\r\nGreat Spirit did not make men that they might destroy one another,\r\nbut doing to each other all the good in their power, and\r\nthus filling the land with happiness instead of misery and murder.\r\nThis is the way in which we wish all our red children to\r\nlive with one another, and with us; and this is what I wish you\r\nto say to your nation from me, when you deliver to them what I\r\nsaid to you the last winter. I am sorry you have not been able\r\nto carry it to them; they would have seen by that, that you\r\ncame here as the friend of your own nation, and of all your red\r\nbrethren. My son, I take by the hand the young man, the son\r\nof your friend, whom you brought with you. He is now young,\r\nand I hope will live to be old, and through his life will be steadfast\r\nin encouraging his nation to live in peace and friendship with\r\ntheir white brethren of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary at War will provide for your journey back, and\r\nyour father Governor Hull will be glad to see you on your way.\r\nHe will always give good advice to your nation in my name, and\r\nwill guide them in the paths of peace and friendship with all men.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV.\r\n\r\n                                                      January 9, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Deputies of the Cherokee Upper Towns_:--\r\n\r\n_My Children_,--I have maturely considered the speeches you\r\nhave delivered me, and will now give you answers to the several\r\nmatters they contain.\r\n\r\nYou inform me of your anxious desires to engage in the industrious\r\npursuits of agriculture and civilized life. That finding\r\nit impracticable to induce the nation at large to join in this, you\r\nwish a line of separation to be established between the upper\r\nand lower towns, so as to include all the waters of the Hiwassee\r\nin your part, and that having thus contracted your society within\r\nnarrower limits, you propose within these to begin the establishment\r\nof fixed laws and of regular government. You say that\r\nthe lower towns are satisfied with the division you propose; and\r\non these several matters you ask my advice and aid.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the line of division between yourselves and\r\nthe lower towns, it must rest on the joint consent of both parties.\r\nThe one you propose seems moderate, reasonable, and\r\nwell defined. We are willing to recognize those on each side of\r\nthat line as distinct societies, and if our aid shall be necessary to\r\nmark it more plainly than nature has done, you shall have it. I\r\nthink with you, that on this reduced scale it will be more easy\r\nfor you to introduce the regular administration of laws.\r\n\r\nIn proceeding to the establishment of laws, you wish to adopt\r\nthem from ours, and such only for the present as suit your present\r\ncondition; chiefly, indeed, those for the punishment of\r\ncrimes, and the protection of property. But who is to determine\r\nwhich of our laws suit your condition, and shall be in force\r\nwith you? All of you being equally free, no one has a right to\r\nsay what shall be law for the others. Our way is to put these\r\nquestions to the vote, and to consider that as law for which the\r\nmajority votes. The fool has as great a right to express his\r\nopinion by vote as the wise, because he is equally free, and equally\r\nmaster of himself. But as it would be inconvenient for all your\r\nmen to meet in one place, would it not be better for every town to\r\ndo as we do, that is to say, choose by the vote of the majority of\r\nthe town and of the country people nearer to that than to any\r\nother town, one, two, three, or more, according to the size of the\r\ntown, of those whom each voter thinks the wisest and honestest\r\nmen of their place, and let these meet together and agree which\r\nof our laws suit them. But these men know nothing of our\r\nlaws; how then can they know which to adopt. Let them associate\r\nin their council our beloved man living with them,\r\nColonel Meigs, and he will tell them what our law is on any\r\npoint they desire. He will inform them, also, of our methods\r\nof doing business in our councils, so as to preserve order, and to\r\nobtain the vote of every member fairly. This council can make\r\na law for giving to every head of a family a separate parcel of\r\nland, which, when he has built upon and improved, it shall belong\r\nto him and his descendants forever, and which the nation\r\nitself shall have no right to sell from under his feet; they will\r\ndetermine, too, what punishment shall be inflicted for every\r\ncrime. In our States, generally, we punish murder only by\r\ndeath, and all other crimes by solitary confinement in a prison.\r\n\r\nBut when you shall have adopted laws, who are to execute\r\nthem? Perhaps it may be best to permit every town and the\r\nsettlers in its neighborhood attached to it, to select some of their\r\nbest men, by a majority of its votes, to be judges in all differences,\r\nand to execute the law according to their own judgment.\r\nYour council of representatives will decide on this or such other\r\nmode as may best suit you. I suggest these things, my children,\r\nfor the consideration of the upper towns of your nation, to be decided\r\non as they think best; and I sincerely wish you may succeed\r\nin your laudable endeavors to save the remains of your nation\r\nby adopting industrious occupations and a government of\r\nregular law. In this you may always rely on the counsel and\r\nassistance of the government of the United States. Deliver these\r\nwords to your people in my name, and assure them of my friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV.\r\n\r\n                                                      January 9, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Deputies of the Cherokees of the Upper and Lower Towns_:--\r\n\r\n_My Children_,--I understand from the speeches which you\r\nhave delivered me, that there is a difference of disposition among\r\nthe people of both parts of your nation, some of them desiring to\r\nremain on their lands, to betake themselves to agriculture, and\r\nthe industrious occupations of civilized life, while others, retaining\r\ntheir attachment to the hunter life, and having little game\r\non their present lands, are desirous to remove across the Mississippi,\r\nto some of the vacant lands of the United States, where\r\ngame is abundant. I am pleased to find so many disposed to\r\nensure, by the cultivation of the earth, a plentiful subsistence\r\nfor their families, and to improve their minds by education; but\r\nI do not blame those who, having been brought up from their\r\ninfancy to the pursuit of game, desire still to follow it to distant\r\ncountries. I know how difficult it is for men to change the\r\nhabits in which they have been raised. The United States, my\r\nchildren, are the friends of both parties, and as far as can reasonably\r\nbe asked, they will be willing to satisfy the wishes of\r\nboth. Those who remain may be assured of our patronage, our\r\naid, and good neighborhood; those who wish to remove, are permitted\r\nto send an exploring party to reconnoitre the country on\r\nthe waters of the Arkansas and White rivers, and the higher up\r\nthe better, as they will be the longer unapproached by our settlements,\r\nwhich will begin at the mouths of those rivers. The\r\nregular districts of the government of St. Louis are already laid\r\noff to the St. Francis. When this party shall have found a tract\r\nof country suiting the emigrants, and not claimed by other Indians,\r\nwe will arrange with them and you the exchange of that\r\nfor a just portion of the country they leave, and to a part of\r\nwhich proportioned to their numbers they have a right. Every\r\naid towards their removal, and what will be necessary for them\r\nthere, will then be freely administered to them, and when established\r\nin their new settlements, we shall still consider them as\r\nour children, give them the benefit of exchanging their peltries\r\nfor what they want at our factories, and always hold them firmly\r\nby the hand.\r\n\r\nI will now, my children, proceed to answer your kind address\r\non my retiring from the government. Sensible that I am become\r\ntoo old to watch over the extensive concerns of the seventeen\r\nStates and their territories, I requested my fellow citizens\r\nto permit me to retire, to live with my family, and to choose\r\nanother President for themselves and father for you. They have\r\ndone so; and in a short time I shall retire, and resign into his\r\nhands the care of your and our concerns. Be assured, my children,\r\nthat he will have the same friendly dispositions towards you\r\nwhich I have had, and that you will find in him a true and affectionate\r\nfather. Indeed, this is now the disposition of all our people\r\ntowards you; they look upon you as brethren, born in the same\r\nland, and having the same interests. Tell your people, therefore,\r\nto entertain no uneasiness on account of this change, for\r\nthere will be no change as to them. Deliver to them my adieux,\r\nand my prayers to the Great Spirit for their happiness. Tell\r\nthem that during my administration I have held their hand fast\r\nin mine, and that I will put it into the hand of their new father,\r\nwho will hold it as I have done.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI.\r\n\r\n                                                     January 10, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Chiefs of the Wyandots, Ottawas, Chippewas, Powtewatamies\r\nand Shawanese_:--\r\n\r\n_My Children_,--This is the first time I have had the pleasure\r\nof seeing the distinguished men of our neighbors the Wyandots,\r\nOttawas and Chippewas, at the seat of our government. I welcome\r\nyou to it as well as the Powtewatamies and Shawanese, and\r\nthank the Great Spirit for having conducted you hither in safety\r\nand health. I take you and your people by the hand and salute\r\nyou as my children; I consider all my red children as forming\r\none family with the whites, born in the same land with them,\r\nand bound to live like brethren, in peace, friendship and good\r\nneighborhood. In former times, my children, we were not our\r\nown masters, but were governed by the English. Then we\r\nwere often at war with our neighbors. Ill blood was raised and\r\nkept up between us, and in the war in which we threw off the\r\nEnglish government, many of the red people, mistaking their\r\nbrothers and real friends, took sides with the English government\r\nagainst us; and it was not till many years after we made peace with\r\nthe English, that the treaty of Grenville closed our last wars with\r\nour Indian neighbors. From that time, my children, we have\r\nlooked on you as a part of ourselves, and have cherished your\r\nprosperity as our own. We saw that these things were wasting\r\naway your numbers to nothing; that the intemperate use of\r\nardent spirits produced poverty, trouble and murders among you;\r\nyour wars with one another were lessening your numbers, and\r\nattachment to the hunter life, after game had nearly left you,\r\nproduced famine, sickness and deaths among you in the scarce\r\nseason of every year. It has been our endeavor, therefore, like\r\ntrue fathers and brothers, to withhold strong liquors from you, to\r\nkeep you in peace with one another, and to encourage and aid\r\nyou in the culture of the earth, and raising domestic animals, to\r\ntake the place of the wild ones. This we have done, my children,\r\nbecause we are your friends, and wish you well. If we\r\nfeared you, if we were your enemies, we should have furnished\r\nyou plentifully with whiskey, let the men destroy one another\r\nin perpetual wars, and the women and children waste away for\r\nwant of food, and remain insensible that they could raise it out\r\nof the earth. We have been told, my children, that some of\r\nyou have been doubting whether we or the English were your\r\ntruest friends. What do the English do for you? They furnish\r\nyou with plenty of whiskey, to keep you in idleness, drunkenness\r\nand poverty; and they are now exciting you to join them\r\nin war against us, if war should take place between them and\r\nus. But we tell you to stay at home in quiet, to take no part\r\nin quarrels which do not concern you. The English are now at\r\nwar with all the world but us, and it is not yet known whether\r\nthey will not force us also into it. They are strong on the\r\nwater, but weak on the land. We live on the land and we fear\r\nthem not. We are able to fight our own battles; therefore we\r\ndo not ask you to spill your blood in our quarrels, much less do\r\nwe wish to be forced to spill it with our own hands. You have\r\ntravelled through our country from the lakes to the tide waters.\r\nYou have seen our numbers in that direction, and were you to\r\npass along the sea shore you would find them much greater.\r\nYou know the English numbers, their scattered forts and string\r\nof people, along the borders of the lakes and the St. Lawrence,\r\nhow long do you think it will take us to sweep them out of the\r\ncountry? and when they are swept away, what is to become of\r\nthose who join them in their war against us? My children, if\r\nyou love the land in which you were born, if you wish to inhabit\r\nthe earth which covers the bones of your fathers, take no part\r\nin the war between the English and us, if we should have war.\r\nNever will we do an unjust act towards you. On the contrary,\r\nwe wish to befriend you in every possible way; but the tribe\r\nwhich shall begin an unprovoked war against us, we will extirpate\r\nfrom the earth, or drive to such a distance as that they shall\r\nnever again be able to strike us. I tell you these things my\r\nchildren, not to make you afraid. I know you are brave men\r\nand therefore cannot fear. But you are also wise men and prudent\r\nmen. I say it, therefore, that, in your wisdom and prudence,\r\nyou may look forward. That you may go to the graves\r\nof your fathers and say, \"fathers, shall we abandon you?\" That\r\nyou may look in the faces of your wives and children and ask,\r\n\"shall we expose these our own flesh and blood to perish from\r\nwant in a distant country and have our race and name extinguished\r\nfrom the face of the earth?\" Think of these things,\r\nmy children, as wise men, and as men loving their fathers, their\r\nwives and children, and the name and memory of their nation.\r\nI repeat, that we will never do an unjust act towards you. On\r\nthe contrary, we wish you to live in peace, to increase in numbers,\r\nto learn to labor as we do, and furnish food for your increasing\r\nnumbers, when the game shall have left you. We wish\r\nto see you possessed of property, and protecting it by regular\r\nlaws. In time, you will be as we are; you will become one\r\npeople with us. Your blood will mix with ours; and will spread,\r\nwith ours, over this great island. Hold fast then, my children,\r\nthe chain of friendship which binds us together, and join us in\r\nkeeping it forever bright and unbroken.\r\n\r\nI invite you to come here, my children, that you might hear\r\nwith your own ears, the words of your father; that you might\r\nsee with your own eyes, the sincere disposition of the United\r\nStates towards you. In your journey to this place you have seen\r\ngreat numbers of your white brothers; you have been received\r\nby them as brothers, have been treated kindly and hospitably,\r\nand you have seen and can tell your people that their hearts are\r\nnow sincerely with you. This is the first time I have ever addressed\r\nyour chiefs, in person, at the seat of Government,--it\r\nwill also be the last. Sensible that I am become too old to\r\nwatch over the extensive concerns of the seventeen States and\r\ntheir territories, I requested my fellow citizens to permit me to\r\nretire to live with my family, and to choose another President\r\nfor themselves, and father for you. They have done so; and in\r\na short time I shall retire and resign into his hands the care of\r\nyour and our concerns. Be assured, my children, that he will\r\nhave the same friendly dispositions towards you which I have\r\nhad, and that you will find in him a true and affectionate father.\r\nIndeed this is now the disposition of all our people towards you;\r\nthey look upon you as brethren, born in the same land, and having\r\nthe same interests. Tell your people, therefore, to entertain\r\nno uneasiness on account of this change, for there will be no\r\nchange as to them. Deliver to them my adieus, and my prayers\r\nto the Great Spirit for their happiness. Tell them that during\r\nmy administration, I have held their hand fast in mine; and that\r\nI will put it into the hand of their new father, who will hold it\r\nas I have done.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII.\r\n\r\n                                                     January 18, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Chiefs of the Ottawas, Chippewas, Powtewatamies, Shawanese and\r\nWyandots_:--\r\n\r\n_My Children_,--I have considered the speech you have delivered\r\nme, and will now make answer to it. You have gone\r\nback to ancient times, and given a true history of the uses made\r\nof you by the French, who first inhabited your country, and\r\nafterwards by the English; and how they used you as dogs to\r\nset upon those whom they wanted to destroy. They kept the\r\nhatchet always in your hand, exposing you to be killed in their\r\nquarrels, and then gave you whiskey that you might quarrel and\r\nkill one another. I am glad you understand these things, and\r\nare determined no more to fight their battles. We shall never\r\nwish you to fight ours, but to stay at home in peace and take care\r\nof yourselves. You still wish, however, to keep up a correspondence\r\nwith the English, because you say your young\r\npeople find an advantage in it. The less you have to do with\r\nthem the better, because all their endeavors will be, as you\r\nknow, to persuade you to go to war for them. If they owe you\r\nfor lands, they ought to pay you once for all and be done with\r\nit. With respect to your people on the English side of the\r\nwater, should we have war with the English, let them remain\r\nneutral and we shall not disturb them; but if the English should\r\nendeavor to force them into the war, you would do well to receive\r\nthem and let them live with you till we can clear the way\r\nfor them to go back again, which will not take long.\r\n\r\nYou ask me what passed between this Government and the\r\nLittle Turtle, the chiefs of the Chippewas, Powtewatamies,\r\nShawanese, Ottawas, Isaac Williams, the Crane and the Delawares,\r\nat their visits to the seat of this Government many years\r\nago. Those visits were in the time of my predecessors, so that\r\nI did not hear their speeches, and they did not leave them in\r\nwriting. It is not in my power, therefore, to tell you what they\r\nwere. But I can assure you that when the Little Turtle visited\r\nme, and in like manner when the chiefs of other tribes have\r\nvisited me, not one word was ever said to the prejudice of the\r\nother Indians. I have no reason to believe they wished to speak\r\nto me in that way, but if they did, they knew I would not listen\r\nto them, and therefore did not do it. My advice to them all has\r\nbeen constantly to live in peace and friendship with one another,\r\nto begin to cultivate the earth, to raise domestic animals,\r\nand leave off the use of ardent spirits: in short, precisely what I\r\nhave said to yourselves.\r\n\r\nYou ask whether the treaties at Swan's creek, and those of\r\nthe last fall, and the fall before, were made by my desire. I\r\nwill explain the subject to you. We consider your lands as belonging\r\nfully to yourselves, and that we have no right to purchase\r\nthem but with your own free consent. Whenever you\r\nwish to sell, we are willing to buy, although it may be lands\r\nwhich we do not immediately want. We believe it to be for\r\nyour benefit to sell a part of your lands for annuities, which may\r\nenable you to improve farms, and in the meantime to support\r\nyourselves. While you keep such large tracts of country, the\r\nfew deer which remain tempt you to continue hunters, and are\r\nyet not enough to maintain you plentifully through the year.\r\nA small part of the land cultivated in corn, with the cattle, hogs,\r\nand sheep it would enable you to raise, would maintain you better\r\nthrough the year, than the whole does in game. A thorough\r\npersuasion, therefore, that it is better for you to turn your surplus\r\nlands from time to time into money, induces us to buy when you\r\ndesire to sell. On this principle, at the treaty of Swan's creek\r\nwe purchased the slip of land which laid between what you sold\r\nto the Connecticut company and our former lines. We had no\r\nparticular desire to buy it, but were told that it would be convenient\r\nto you to sell that parcel, and therefore we bought it.\r\n\r\nThe lands which were purchased of you near Detroit the last\r\nfall and the fall before, we did wish to purchase, provided you\r\nwere willing freely to sell. At Detroit, you know, we keep a\r\ngarrison to watch the English, and to protect the factory we\r\nestablish there, to carry on trade with you. It is very desirable\r\nfor us, therefore, to obtain so much land in the neighborhood as\r\nwould receive settlers sufficient to raise provisions for the garrison,\r\nand to strengthen the garrison if attacked by the English.\r\nBut still we instructed Governor Hull, however much we wished\r\nto get some land there, not to press it on you if you were not entirely\r\nwilling to accommodate us. The settlement of our people\r\nthere will be a great advantage to you if you become cultivators\r\nof the earth. You saw the Cherokees who were here when you\r\narrived, my children. These were wealthy men, and became\r\nwealthy merely by living near our settlements. Their mother\r\ntowns of Chota and Chilowee, are but twelve miles from our\r\nprincipal town of Knoxville. The Cherokees there have good\r\nfarms, good houses, and abundance of cattle and horses. If a\r\nfamily raises more cattle or corn than they want for their own\r\nuse, instead of letting it be eaten by their own lazy people who\r\nwill not work, they carry it to Knoxville, sell it to our people,\r\nand purchase with the money clothes and other comforts for themselves.\r\nOur settlements around Detroit will give you the same\r\nadvantages. If you become farmers and raise cattle, hogs, sheep,\r\nfowls, and such things to spare, you can immediately exchange\r\nthem for clothing and other necessaries. I am satisfied, therefore,\r\nmy children, that the accommodating us with that land was as\r\nbeneficial to you as to us. But, notwithstanding, I believe it to\r\nbe better for you to sell your surplus lands from time to time;\r\nyet I repeat to you the assurances that although we may go so\r\nfar, sometimes, as to say we would be willing to buy such a\r\npiece of land, yet we will never press you to sell, until you shall\r\ndesire yourselves to sell it.\r\n\r\nI have thus, my children, answered the particulars of your\r\nspeech. I have done it with truth and an open heart, and I hope\r\nit will be satisfactory to you.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII.\r\n\r\n                                                     January 31, 1809.\r\n\r\n_To the Chiefs of the Ottawas, Chippewas, Powtewatamies, Wyandots, and\r\nShawanese_:--\r\n\r\n_My Children_,--I have considered the speech you have delivered\r\nme, and I will now give you an answer to it.\r\n\r\nYou have told us on former occasions of certain promises\r\nmade to you at the treaty of Grenville, by General Wayne, respecting\r\ncertain lands whereon you and your friends live. But\r\nwhen we looked into the treaty of Grenville, we found no such\r\npromises there; and as it is our custom to put all our agreements\r\ninto writing, that they may never be forgotten or mistaken, we\r\nconcluded no such promises had been made. But you now explain\r\nthat the chiefs of the Wyandots near Detroit did not arrive\r\nat Grenville till after the treaty was signed--that they then convinced\r\nGeneral Wayne that provision ought to be made for securing\r\nto them possession of the lands they lived on, so long as\r\nthey and their descendants shall choose to live on them, and that\r\nhe agreed to it. Of this, besides other evidence, you now produce\r\nthe belt of wampum reserved by you, in memory of it, the\r\ncounter-belt given us having probably been destroyed in the fire\r\nwhich consumed our war office in the year 1800. Such evidence,\r\ntherefore, being now produced as induces a belief of the\r\nagreement, it shall be committed to writing, according to what\r\nhas passed between the Secretary at War and yourselves; and\r\nwe will also put into writing what has passed respecting the reserves\r\nfor the Indians, and you shall have a copy of these writings\r\nwhich shall be firm and good to you forever.\r\n\r\nYou complain that white people go on your lands and settle\r\nwithout your consent. This is entirely against our will, and I\r\nearnestly desire you, my children, as soon as any intruder of the\r\nwhites sets down on your lands, that you will not delay a moment\r\nto inform our agent, who will always be instructed in the\r\nmeasures to be taken for their immediate removal; and I desire\r\nyou to do this, on your return, as to the intruders you now complain\r\nof.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary at War has explained to you the circumstances\r\nwhich attended the running the boundary line near Sandusky,\r\nunder the treaty at Swan's creek, so as to satisfy you that no\r\nvariation of it was intended; and you may be assured that when\r\nwe proceed to run the lines for the roads granted us the last fall,\r\nyou shall have notice, in order that your chiefs may attend and\r\nsee it fairly done.\r\n\r\nFor these roads, with which your nations have been so friendly\r\nas to accommodate us, and which you wished us to accept as a\r\npresent, I return you my thanks, and I accept them; and I request\r\nyou, on our part, to accept as a token of our good will, the\r\nsum of a thousand dollars, of which five hundred dollars will be\r\npaid you here. And we shall be happy if you can employ this\r\nsum to your benefit or comfort in any way. Our settlements are\r\nnow extending so much in every direction, that we shall be\r\nobliged to ask roads from our Indian brethren, that we may pass\r\nconveniently from one settlement to another, for which we will\r\nalways gladly pay them the full value.\r\n\r\nYou have been informed, as you desired, of the exact amount\r\nof your annuities.\r\n\r\nI have thus, my children, answered all the parts of your\r\nspeech, and I have done it sincerely and with good will to you.\r\nI have not filled you with whiskey, as the English do, to make\r\nyou promise, or give up what is against your interest, when out\r\nof your senses. I have listened to your complaints and proposals,\r\nI have found them reasonable, and I have given you the answers\r\nwhich a just and a reasonable nation ought to do. And this you\r\nmay be assured is the way in which we shall always do business\r\nwith you, because we do not consider you as another nation,\r\nbut as a part of us, living indeed under your own laws, but having\r\nthe same interests with us. I hope you will tell these things\r\nto your people, and that they will sink deep into their minds.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO PART II, OF BOOK III.\r\n\r\nCONFIDENTIAL MESSAGE RECOMMENDING A WESTERN EXPLORING\r\nEXPEDITION--JANUARY 18, 1803.\r\n\r\n_Gentlemen of the Senate and of the House of Representatives_:--\r\n\r\nAs the continuance of the act for establishing trading-houses\r\nwith the Indian tribes, will be under the consideration of the\r\nlegislature at its present session, I think it my duty to communicate\r\nthe views which have guided me in the execution of that\r\nact, in order that you may decide on the policy of continuing it,\r\nin the present or any other form, or discontinue it altogether, if\r\nthat shall, on the whole, seem most for the public good.\r\n\r\nThe Indian tribes residing within the limits of the United\r\nStates, have, for a considerable time, been growing more and\r\nmore uneasy at the constant diminution of the territory they occupy,\r\nalthough effected by their own voluntary sales; and the\r\npolicy has long been gaining strength with them, of refusing absolutely\r\nall further sale, on any conditions; insomuch that, at this\r\ntime, it hazards their friendship, and excites dangerous jealousies\r\nand perturbations in their minds to make any overture for the\r\npurchase of the smallest portions of their land. A very few\r\ntribes only are not yet obstinately in these dispositions. In order\r\npeaceably to counteract this policy of theirs, and to provide an\r\nextension of territory which the rapid increase of our numbers\r\nwill call for, two measures are deemed expedient. First: to\r\nencourage them to abandon hunting, to apply to the raising\r\nstock, to agriculture and domestic manufactures, and thereby\r\nprove to themselves that less land and labor will maintain them\r\nin this, better than in their former mode of living. The extensive\r\nforests necessary in the hunting life will then become useless,\r\nand they will see advantage in exchanging them for the\r\nmeans of improving their farms and of increasing their domestic\r\ncomforts. Secondly: to multiply trading-houses among them,\r\nand place within their reach those things which will contribute\r\nmore to their domestic comfort than the possession of extensive\r\nbut uncultivated wilds. Experience and reflection will develop\r\nto them the wisdom of exchanging what they can spare and\r\nwe want, for what we can spare and they want. In leading\r\nthem thus to agriculture, to manufactures, and civilization; in\r\nbringing together their and our settlements, and in preparing\r\nthem ultimately to participate in the benefits of our government,\r\nI trust and believe we are acting for their greatest good. At\r\nthese trading-houses we have pursued the principles of the act\r\nof Congress, which directs that the commerce shall be carried\r\non liberally, and requires only that the capital stock shall not be\r\ndiminished. We consequently undersell private traders, foreign\r\nand domestic; drive them from the competition; and thus, with\r\nthe good will of the Indians, rid ourselves of a description of men\r\nwho are constantly endeavoring to excite in the Indian mind\r\nsuspicions, fears, and irritations toward us. A letter now enclosed,\r\nshows the effect of our competition on the operations of\r\nthe traders, while the Indians, perceiving the advantage of purchasing\r\nfrom us, are soliciting generally our establishment of\r\ntrading houses among them. In one quarter this is particularly\r\ninteresting. The legislature, reflecting on the late occurrences\r\non the Mississippi, must be sensible how desirable it is to possess\r\na respectable breadth of country on that river, from our southern\r\nlimit to the Illinois at least, so that we may present as firm a\r\nfront on that as on our eastern border. We possess what is below\r\nthe Yazoo, and can probably acquire a certain breadth from\r\nthe Illinois and Wabash to the Ohio; but between the Ohio and\r\nYazoo, the country all belongs to the Chickasaws, the most\r\nfriendly tribe within our limits, but the most decided against the\r\nalienation of lands. The portion of their country most important\r\nfor us is exactly that which they do not inhabit. Their settlements\r\nare not on the Mississippi, but in the interior country.\r\nThey have lately shown a desire to become agricultural, and this\r\nleads to the desire of buying implements and comforts. In the\r\nstrengthening and gratifying of these wants, I see the only prospect\r\nof planting on the Mississippi itself, the means of its own\r\nsafety. Duty has required me to submit these views to the judgment\r\nof the legislature; but as their disclosure might embarrass\r\nand defeat their effect, they are committed to the special confidence\r\nof the two houses.\r\n\r\nWhile the extension of the public commerce among the Indian\r\ntribes, may deprive of that source of profit such of our citizens as\r\nare engaged in it, it might be worthy the attention of Congress,\r\nin their care of individual as well as of the general interest, to\r\npoint in another direction the enterprize of these citizens, as profitably\r\nfor themselves, and more usefully for the public. The\r\nriver Missouri, and the Indians inhabiting it, are not as well\r\nknown as is rendered desirable by their connection with the\r\nMississippi, and consequently with us. It is, however, understood,\r\nthat the country on that river is inhabited by numerous\r\ntribes, who furnish great supplies of furs and peltry to the trade\r\nof another nation, carried on in a high latitude, through an infinite\r\nnumber of portages and lakes, shut up by ice through a\r\nlong season. The commerce on that line could bear no competition\r\nwith that of the Missouri, traversing a moderate climate,\r\noffering, according to the best accounts, a continued navigation\r\nfrom its source, and possibly with a single portage, from the\r\nwestern ocean, and finding to the Atlantic a choice of channels\r\nthrough the Illinois or Wabash, the lakes and Hudson, through\r\nthe Ohio and Susquehanna, or Potomac or James rivers, and\r\nthrough the Tennessee and Savannah rivers. An intelligent\r\nofficer, with ten or twelve chosen men, fit for the enterprize, and\r\nwilling to undertake it, taken from our posts, where they may\r\nbe spared without inconvenience, might explore the whole line,\r\neven to the western ocean; have conferences with the natives\r\non the subject of commercial intercourse; get admission\r\namong them for our traders, as others are admitted; agree on\r\nconvenient deposits for an interchange of articles; and return\r\nwith the information acquired, in the course of two summers.\r\nTheir arms and accoutrements, some instruments of observation,\r\nand light and cheap presents for the Indians, would be all the\r\napparatus they could carry, and with an expectation of a soldier's\r\nportion of land on their return, would constitute the whole expense.\r\nTheir pay would be going on, whether here or there.\r\nWhile other civilized nations have encountered great expense to\r\nenlarge the boundaries of knowledge, by undertaking voyages\r\nof discovery, and for other literary purposes, in various parts and\r\ndirections, our nation seems to owe to the same object, as well\r\nas to its own interests, to explore this, the only line of easy communication\r\nacross the continent, and so directly traversing our\r\nown part of it. The interests of commerce place the principal\r\nobject within the constitutional powers and care of Congress, and\r\nthat it should incidentally advance the geographical knowledge\r\nof our own continent, can not but be an additional gratification.\r\nThe nation claiming the territory, regarding this as a literary\r\npursuit, which it is in the habit of permitting within its own dominions,\r\nwould not be disposed to view it with jealousy, even if\r\nthe expiring state of its interests there did not render it a matter\r\nof indifference. The appropriation of two thousand five hundred\r\ndollars, \"for the purpose of extending the external commerce of\r\nthe United States,\" while understood and considered by the executive\r\nas giving the legislative sanction, would cover the undertaking\r\nfrom notice, and prevent the obstructions which interested\r\nindividuals might otherwise previously prepare in its way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART   I.--NOTES ON VIRGINIA.\r\n   \"    II.--BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES OF DISTINGUISHED MEN.\r\n   \"   III.--THE BATTURE AT NEW ORLEANS.\r\n   \"    IV.--JEFFERSON'S MANUAL.\r\n   \"     V.--THE ANAS.\r\n   \"    VI.--MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY TO BOOK IV.\r\n\r\nThis fourth and last division of the work contains a large mass of very valuable\r\nand interesting miscellaneous matter--everything, indeed, valuable and interesting\r\nwritten by Mr. Jefferson, and not embraced in the previous divisions\r\nof the work. To the general reader, it will be found much the most instructive\r\nand entertaining portion of the publication, ranging, as it does, over a vast field\r\nof discussion--unless, perhaps, the latter portion of Mr. Jefferson's Correspondence\r\nbe excepted, say, from 1812 to the end of his life. Among the interesting papers\r\ncontained in this division of the work, may be enumerated the \"Notes on Virginia,\"\r\nbiographical sketches of distinguished Revolutionary characters, Mr. Jefferson's\r\nargument in vindication of his official action while President of the United\r\nStates in connection with the Batture at New Orleans--the celebrated Anas,\r\nResolutions defining the relations between the State and Federal Governments,\r\nand believed to be the originals of the Kentucky Resolutions of 1799, &c. These\r\nare but a few of the interesting papers comprised in Book IV. There are many\r\nothers possessing great intrinsic interest and a very considerable historical value,\r\nas throwing much light upon the early history of our country. And nowhere\r\ndoes the genius of the distinguished Author, and the richness and diversity of his\r\nresources, more impress the reader than in the mass of miscellaneous matter collected\r\nin this last division of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nTO\r\n\r\nNOTES ON VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n                                                                    PAGE\r\n\r\n     I.--An exact description of the limits and boundaries of\r\n              the State of Virginia,                                 249\r\n\r\n     II.--A notice of the rivers, rivulets, and how far they\r\n              are navigable,                                         250\r\n\r\n     III.--A notice of the best seaports of the State, and how\r\n              big are the vessels they can receive,                  263\r\n\r\n     IV.--A notice of its mountains,                                 263\r\n\r\n     V.--Its cascades and caverns,                                   266\r\n\r\n     VI.--A notice of the mines and other subterraneous riches;\r\n              its trees, plants, fruits, &c.,                        270\r\n\r\n     VII.--A notice of all that can increase the progress of\r\n              human knowledge,                                       320\r\n\r\n     VIII.--The number of its inhabitants,                           328\r\n\r\n     IX.--The number and condition of the militia and regular\r\n              troops, and their pay,                                 334\r\n\r\n     X.--The marine,                                                 334\r\n\r\n     XI.--A description of the Indians established in that State,    336\r\n\r\n     XII.--A notice of the counties, cities, townships and villages, 350\r\n\r\n     XIII.--The constitution of the State, and its several charters, 352\r\n\r\n     XIV.--The administration of justice and the description of\r\n               the laws,                                             372\r\n\r\n     XV.--The colleges and public establishments, the roads,\r\n              buildings, &c.,                                        391\r\n\r\n     XVI.--The measures taken with regard to the estates and\r\n              possessions of the rebels, commonly called tories,     396\r\n\r\n     XVII.--The different religions received into that State,        398\r\n\r\n     XVIII.--The particular customs and manners that may happen to\r\n               be received in that State,                            403\r\n\r\n     XIX.--The present state of manufactures, commerce, interior\r\n              and exterior trade,                                    404\r\n\r\n     XX.--A notice of the commercial productions particular to\r\n              the State, and of those objects which the inhabitants\r\n              are obliged to get from Europe and from other parts\r\n              of the world                                           406\r\n\r\n     XXI.--The weights, measures, and the currency of the hard\r\n              money.

By admeasurements\r\nthrough nearly the whole of this last line, and\r\nsupplying the unmeasured parts from good data, the Atlantic\r\nand Mississippi are found in this latitude to be seven hundred\r\nand fifty-eight miles distant, equal to 30° 38' of longitude,\r\nreckoning fifty-five miles and three thousand one hundred and\r\nforty-four feet to the degree. This being our comprehension\r\nof longitude, that of our latitude, taken between this and Mason\r\nand Dixon's line, is 3° 13' 42.4\" equal to two hundred and\r\ntwenty-three and one-third miles, supposing a degree of a great\r\ncircle to be sixty-nine miles, eight hundred and sixty-four feet,\r\nas computed by Cassini. These boundaries include an area\r\nsomewhat triangular of one hundred and twenty-one thousand\r\nfive hundred and twenty-five square miles, whereof seventy-nine\r\nthousand six hundred and fifty lie westward of the Alleghany\r\nmountains, and fifty-seven thousand and thirty-four westward of\r\nthe meridian of the mouth of the Great Kanhaway. This State\r\nis therefore one-third larger than the islands of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, which are reckoned at eighty-eight thousand three hundred\r\nand fifty-seven square miles.\r\n\r\nThese limits result from, 1. The ancient charters from the\r\ncrown of England. 2. The grant of Maryland to the Lord\r\nBaltimore, and the subsequent determinations of the British court\r\nas to the extent of that grant. 3. The grant of Pennsylvania\r\nto William Penn, and a compact between the general assemblies\r\nof the commonwealths of Virginia and Pennsylvania as to the\r\nextent of that grant. 4. The grant of Carolina, and actual location\r\nof its northern boundary, by consent of both parties.\r\n5. The treaty of Paris of 1763. 6. The confirmation of the\r\ncharters of the neighboring States by the convention of _Virginia_\r\nat the time of constituting their commonwealth. 7. The\r\ncession made by _Virginia_ to Congress of all the lands to which\r\nthey had title on the north side of the Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY II.\r\n\r\n_A notice of its rivers, rivulets, and how far they are navigable?_\r\n\r\nAn inspection of a map of _Virginia_, will give a better idea\r\nof the geography of its rivers, than any description in writing.\r\nTheir navigation may be imperfectly noted.\r\n\r\n_Roanoke_, so far as it lies within the State, is nowhere\r\nnavigable but for canoes, or light batteaux; and even for these\r\nin such detached parcels as to have prevented the inhabitants\r\nfrom availing themselves of it at all.\r\n\r\n_James River_, and its waters, afford navigation as follows:\r\n\r\nThe whole of _Elizabeth River_, the lowest of those which\r\nrun into James River, is a harbor, and would contain upwards of\r\nthree hundred ships. The channel is from one hundred and fifty\r\nto two hundred fathoms wide, and at common flood tide affords\r\neighteen feet water to Norfolk. The Stafford, a sixty gun ship,\r\nwent there, lightening herself to cross the bar at Sowel's Point.\r\nThe Fier Rodrigue, pierced for sixty-four guns, and carrying\r\nfifty, went there without lightening. Craney Island, at the\r\nmouth of this river, commands its channel tolerably well.\r\n\r\n_Nansemond River_ is navigable to Sleepy Hole for vessels of\r\ntwo hundred and fifty tons; to Suffolk for those of one hundred\r\ntons; and to Milner's for those of twenty-five.\r\n\r\n_Pagan Creek_ affords eight or ten feet water to Smithfield,\r\nwhich admits vessels of twenty tons.\r\n\r\n_Chickahominy_ has at its mouth a bar, on which is only twelve\r\nfeet water at common flood tide. Vessels passing that, may go\r\neight miles up the river; those of ten feet draught may go four\r\nmiles further, and those of six tons burden twenty miles further.\r\n\r\n_Appomattox_ may be navigated as far as Broadways, by any vessel\r\nwhich has crossed Harrison's bar in James River; it keeps eight\r\nor ten feet water a mile or two higher up to Fisher's bar, and four\r\nfeet on that and upwards to Petersburg, where all navigation ceases.\r\n\r\n_James River_ itself affords a harbor for vessels of any size in\r\nHampton Road, but not in safety through the whole winter; and\r\nthere is navigable water for them as far as Mulberry Island. A\r\nforty gun ship goes to Jamestown, and, lightening herself, may\r\npass Harrison's bar; on which there is only fifteen feet water.\r\nVessels of two hundred and fifty tons may go to Warwick;\r\nthose of one hundred and twenty-five go to Rocket's, a mile below\r\nRichmond; from thence is about seven feet water to Richmond;\r\nand about the centre of the town, four feet and a half,\r\nwhere the navigation is interrupted by falls, which in a course\r\nof six miles, descend about eighty-eight feet perpendicular; above\r\nthese it is resumed in canoes and batteaux, and is prosecuted\r\nsafely and advantageously to within ten miles of the Blue Ridge;\r\nand even through the Blue Ridge a ton weight has been brought;\r\nand the expense would not be great, when compared with its\r\nobject, to open a tolerable navigation up Jackson's river and Carpenter's\r\ncreek, to within twenty-five miles of Howard's creek of\r\nGreen Briar, both of which have then water enough to float vessels\r\ninto the Great Kanhaway. In some future state of population\r\nI think it possible that its navigation may also be made to\r\ninterlock with that of the Potomac, and through that to communicate\r\nby a short portage with the Ohio. It is to be noted\r\nthat this river is called in the maps _James River_, only to its confluence\r\nwith the Rivanna; thence to the Blue Ridge it is called\r\nthe Fluvanna; and thence to its source Jackson's river. But in\r\ncommon speech, it is called James River to its source.\r\n\r\nThe _Rivanna_, a branch of James River, is navigable for\r\ncanoes and batteaux to its intersection with the South-West mountains,\r\nwhich is about twenty-two miles; and may easily be\r\nopened to navigation through these mountains to its fork above\r\nCharlottesville.\r\n\r\n_York River_, at Yorktown, affords the best harbor in the State\r\nfor vessels of the largest size. The river there narrows to the\r\nwidth of a mile, and is contained within very high banks, close\r\nunder which vessels may ride. It holds four fathom water at\r\nhigh tide for twenty-five miles above York to the mouth of\r\nPoropotank, where the river is a mile and a half wide, and the\r\nchannel only seventy-five fathom, and passing under a high\r\nbank. At the confluence of _Pamunkey_ and _Mattapony_, it is\r\nreduced to three fathom depth, which continues up Pamunkey\r\nto Cumberland, where the width is one hundred yards, and up\r\nMattapony to within two miles of Frazier's ferry, where it becomes\r\ntwo and a half fathom deep, and holds that about five\r\nmiles. Pamunkey is then capable of navigation for loaded flats\r\nto Brockman's bridge, fifty miles above Hanover town, and\r\nMattapony to Downer's bridge, seventy miles above its mouth.\r\n\r\n_Piankatank_, the little rivers making out of _Mobjack Bay_ and\r\nthose of the eastern shore, receive only very small vessels, and\r\nthese can but enter them.\r\n\r\n_Rappahannock_ affords four fathom water to Hobb's hole, and\r\ntwo fathom from thence to Fredericksburg.\r\n\r\n_Potomac_ is seven and a half miles wide at the mouth; four\r\nand a half at Nomony bay; three at Aquia; one and a half at\r\nHallowing point; one and a quarter at Alexandria. Its soundings\r\nare seven fathom at the mouth; five at St. George's island; four\r\nand a half at Lower Matchodic; three at Swan's point, and\r\nthence up to Alexandria; thence ten feet water to the falls,\r\nwhich are thirteen miles above Alexandria. These falls are fifteen\r\nmiles in length, and of very great descent, and the navigation\r\nabove them for batteaux and canoes is so much interrupted\r\nas to be little used. It is, however, used in a small degree up\r\nthe Cohongoronta branch as far as fort Cumberland, which was\r\nat the mouth of Willis's creek; and is capable, at no great expense,\r\nof being rendered very practicable. The Shenandoah\r\nbranch interlocks with James river about the Blue Ridge, and\r\nmay perhaps in future be opened.\r\n\r\nThe _Mississippi_ will be one of the principal channels of future\r\ncommerce for the country westward of the Alleghany.\r\nFrom the mouth of this river to where it receives the Ohio, is\r\none thousand miles by water, but only five hundred by land,\r\npassing through the Chickasaw country. From the mouth of\r\nthe Ohio to that of the Missouri, is two hundred and thirty miles\r\nby water, and one hundred and forty by land, from thence to the\r\nmouth of the Illinois river, is about twenty-five miles. The\r\nMississippi, below the mouth of the Missouri, is always muddy,\r\nand abounding with sand bars, which frequently change their\r\nplaces. However, it carries fifteen feet water to the mouth of\r\nthe Ohio, to which place it is from one and a half to two miles\r\nwide, and thence to Kaskaskia from one mile to a mile and a\r\nquarter wide. Its current is so rapid, that it never can be\r\nstemmed by the force of the wind alone, acting on sails. Any\r\nvessel, however, navigated with oars, may come up at any time,\r\nand receive much aid from the wind. A batteau passes from\r\nthe mouth of Ohio to the mouth of Mississippi in three weeks,\r\nand is from two to three months getting up again. During its\r\nfloods, which are periodical as those of the Nile, the largest vessels\r\nmay pass down it, if their steerage can be insured. These\r\nfloods begin in April, and the river returns into its banks early\r\nin August. The inundation extends further on the western than\r\neastern side, covering the lands in some places for fifty miles\r\nfrom its banks. Above the mouth of the Missouri it becomes\r\nmuch such a river as the Ohio, like it clear and gentle in its current,\r\nnot quite so wide, the period of its floods nearly the same,\r\nbut not rising to so great a height. The streets of the village at\r\nCohoes are not more than ten feet above the ordinary level of\r\nthe water, and yet were never overflowed. Its bed deepens\r\nevery year. Cohoes, in the memory of many people now living,\r\nwas insulated by every flood of the river. What was the eastern\r\nchannel has now become a lake, nine miles in length and\r\none in width, into which the river at this day never flows. This\r\nriver yields turtle of a peculiar kind, perch, trout, gar, pike, mullets,\r\nherrings, carp, spatula-fish of fifty pounds weight, cat-fish\r\nof one hundred pounds weight, buffalo fish, and sturgeon. Aligators\r\nor crocodiles have been seen as high up as the Acansas.\r\nIt also abounds in herons, cranes, ducks, brant, geese, and swans.\r\nIts passage is commanded by a fort established by this State, five\r\nmiles below the mouth of the Ohio, and ten miles above the\r\nCarolina boundary.\r\n\r\nThe _Missouri_, since the treaty of Paris, the Illinois and northern\r\nbranches of the Ohio, since the cession to Congress, are no\r\nlonger within our limits. Yet having been so heretofore, and\r\nstill opening to us channels of extensive communication with the\r\nwestern and north-western country, they shall be noted in their\r\norder.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri is, in fact, the principal river, contributing more\r\nto the common stream than does the Mississippi, even after its\r\njunction with the Illinois. It is remarkably cold, muddy, and\r\nrapid. Its overflowings are considerable. They happen during\r\nthe months of June and July. Their commencement being so\r\nmuch later than those of the Mississippi, would induce a belief\r\nthat the sources of the Missouri are northward of those of the\r\nMississippi, unless we suppose that the cold increases again with\r\nthe ascent of the land from the Mississippi westwardly. That\r\nthis ascent is great, is proved by the rapidity of the river. Six\r\nmiles above the mouth, it is brought within the compass of a\r\nquarter of a mile's width; yet the Spanish merchants at Pancore,\r\nor St. Louis, say they go two thousand miles up it. It heads far\r\nwestward of the Rio Norte, or North River. There is, in the\r\nvillages of Kaskaskia, Cohoes, and St. Vincennes, no inconsiderable\r\nquantity of plate, said to have been plundered during the\r\nlast war by the Indians from the churches and private houses of\r\nSanta Fé, on the North river, and brought to the villages for\r\nsale. From the mouth of the Ohio to Santa Fé are forty days\r\njourney, or about one thousand miles. What is the shortest distance\r\nbetween the navigable waters of the Missouri, and those\r\nof the North river, or how far this is navigable above Santa Fé,\r\nI could never learn. From Santa Fé to its mouth in the Gulf\r\nof Mexico is about twelve hundred miles. The road from New\r\nOrleans to Mexico crosses this river at the post of Rio Norte, eight\r\nhundred miles below Santa Fé, and from this post to New Orleans\r\nis about twelve hundred miles; thus making two thousand\r\nmiles between Santa Fé and New Orleans, passing down the\r\nNorth river, Red river, and Mississippi; whereas it is two thousand\r\ntwo hundred and thirty through the Missouri and Mississippi.\r\nFrom the same post of Rio Norte, passing near the mines\r\nof La Sierra and Laiguana, which are between the North river,\r\nand the river Salina to Sartilla, is three hundred and seventy-five\r\nmiles, and from thence, passing the mines of Charcas, Zaccatecas,\r\nand Potosi, to the city of Mexico, is three hundred and seventy-five\r\nmiles; in all, one thousand five hundred and fifty miles from\r\nSanta Fé to the city of Mexico. From New Orleans to the city\r\nof Mexico is about one thousand nine hundred and fifty miles;\r\nthe roads after setting out from the Red river, near Natchitoches,\r\nkeeping generally parallel with the coast, and about two hundred\r\nmiles from it, till it enters the city of Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe _Illinois_ is a fine river, clear, gentle, and without rapids;\r\ninsomuch that it is navigable for batteaux to its source. From\r\nthence is a portage of two miles only to the Chicago, which affords\r\na batteau navigation of sixteen miles to its entrance into\r\nlake Michigan. The Illinois, about ten miles above its mouth,\r\nis three hundred yards wide.\r\n\r\nThe _Kaskaskia_ is one hundred yards wide at its entrance into\r\nthe Mississippi, and preserves that breadth to the Buffalo plains,\r\nseventy miles above. So far, also, it is navigable for loaded batteaux,\r\nand perhaps much further. It is not rapid.\r\n\r\nThe _Ohio_ is the most beautiful river on earth. Its current\r\ngentle, waters clear, and bosom smooth and unbroken by rocks\r\nand rapids, a single instance only excepted.\r\n\r\nIt is one-quarter of a mile wide at Fort Pitt, five hundred\r\nyards at the mouth of the Great Kanhaway, one mile and\r\ntwenty-five poles at Louisville, one-quarter of a mile on the\r\nrapids three or four miles below Louisville, half a mile where\r\nthe low country begins, which is twenty miles above Green\r\nriver, a mile and a quarter at the receipt of the Tennessee, and a\r\nmile wide at the mouth.\r\n\r\nIts length, as measured according to its meanders by Captain\r\nHutchins, is as follows:--\r\n\r\n From Fort Pitt\r\n\r\n     To Log's Town           18½\r\n     Big Beaver Creek        10¾\r\n     Little Beaver Creek     13½\r\n     Yellow Creek            11¾\r\n     Two Creeks              21¾\r\n     Long Reach              53¾\r\n     End Long Reach          16½\r\n     Muskingum               25½\r\n     Little Kanhaway         12¼\r\n     Hockhocking             16\r\n     Great Kanhaway          82½\r\n     Guiandot                43¾\r\n     Sandy Creek             14½\r\n     Sioto                   48¼\r\n     Little Miami           126¼\r\n     Licking Creek            8\r\n     Great Miami             26¾\r\n     Big Bones               32½\r\n     Kentucky                44¼\r\n     Rapids                  77¼\r\n     Low Country            155¾\r\n     Buffalo River           64½\r\n     Wabash                  97¼\r\n     Big Cave                42¾\r\n     Shawanee River          52½\r\n     Cherokee River          13\r\n     Massac                  11\r\n     Mississippi             46\r\n                           -----\r\n                           1188\r\n\r\nIn common winter and spring tides it affords fifteen feet water\r\nto Louisville, ten feet to Le Tarte's rapids, forty miles above the\r\nmouth of the great Kanhaway, and a sufficiency at all times for\r\nlight batteaux and canoes to Fort Pitt. The rapids are in latitude\r\n38° 8'. The inundations of this river begin about the last\r\nof March, and subside in July. During these, a first-rate man-of-war\r\nmay be carried from Louisville to New Orleans, if the\r\nsudden turns of the river and the strength of its current will admit\r\na safe steerage. The rapids at Louisville descend about\r\nthirty feet in a length of a mile and a half. The bed of the\r\nriver there is a solid rock, and is divided by an island into two\r\nbranches, the southern of which is about two hundred yards\r\nwide, and is dry four months in the year. The bed of the northern\r\nbranch is worn into channels by the constant course of the\r\nwater, and attrition of the pebble stones carried on with that, so\r\nas to be passable for batteaux through the greater part of the\r\nyear. Yet it is thought that the southern arm may be the most\r\neasily opened for constant navigation. The rise of the waters\r\nin these rapids does not exceed ten or twelve feet. A part of\r\nthis island is so high as to have been never overflowed, and to\r\ncommand the settlement at Louisville, which is opposite to it.\r\nThe fort, however, is situated at the head of the falls. The\r\nground on the south side rises very gradually.\r\n\r\nThe _Tennessee_, Cherokee, or Hogohege river, is six hundred\r\nyards wide at its mouth, a quarter of a mile at the mouth of\r\nHolston, and two hundred yards at Chotee, which is twenty\r\nmiles above Holston, and three hundred miles above the mouth\r\nof the Tennessee. This river crosses the southern boundary of\r\nVirginia, fifty-eight miles from the Mississippi. Its current is moderate.\r\nIt is navigable for loaded boats of any burden to the\r\nMuscle shoals, where the river passes through the Cumberland\r\nmountain. These shoals are six or eight miles long, passable\r\ndownwards for loaded canoes, but not upwards, unless there be a\r\nswell in the river. Above these the navigation for loaded canoes\r\nand batteaux continues to the Long island. This river has its\r\ninundations also. Above the Chickamogga towns is a whirlpool\r\ncalled the Sucking-pot, which takes in trunks of trees or boats,\r\nand throws them out again half a mile below. It is avoided by\r\nkeeping very close to the bank, on the south side. There are\r\nbut a few miles portage between a branch of this river and the\r\nnavigable waters of the river Mobile, which runs into the Gulf\r\nof Mexico.\r\n\r\n_Cumberland_, or Shawanee river, intersects the boundary between\r\nVirginia and North Carolina sixty-seven miles from the\r\nMississippi, and again one hundred and ninety-eight miles from\r\nthe same river, a little above the entrance of Obey's river into\r\nthe Cumberland. Its Clear fork crosses the same boundary about\r\nthree hundred miles from the Mississippi. Cumberland is a very\r\ngentle stream, navigable for loaded batteaux eight hundred miles,\r\nwithout interruption; then intervene some rapids of fifteen miles\r\nin length, after which it is again navigable seventy miles upwards,\r\nwhich brings you within ten miles of the Cumberland\r\nmountains. It is about one hundred and twenty yards wide\r\nthrough its whole course, from the head of its navigation to its\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nThe _Wabash_ is a very beautiful river, four hundred yards\r\nwide at the mouth, and three hundred at St. Vincennes, which\r\nis a post one hundred miles above the mouth, in a direct line.\r\nWithin this space there are two small rapids, which give very\r\nlittle obstruction to the navigation. It is four hundred yards\r\nwide at the mouth, and navigable thirty leagues upwards for\r\ncanoes and small boats. From the mouth of Maple river to that\r\nof Eel river is about eighty miles in a direct line, the river continuing\r\nnavigable, and from one to two hundred yards in width.\r\nThe Eel river is one hundred and fifty yards wide, and affords\r\nat all times navigation for periaguas, to within eighteen miles of\r\nthe Miami of the Lake. The Wabash, from the mouth of Eel\r\nriver to Little river, a distance of fifty miles direct, is interrupted\r\nwith frequent rapids and shoals, which obstruct the navigation,\r\nexcept in a swell. Little river affords navigation during a swell\r\nto within three miles of the Miami, which thence affords a similar\r\nnavigation into Lake Erie, one hundred miles distant in a\r\ndirect line. The Wabash overflows periodically in correspondence\r\nwith the Ohio, and in some places two leagues from its banks.\r\n\r\n_Green River_ is navigable for loaded batteaux at all times fifty\r\nmiles upwards; but it is then interrupted by impassable rapids,\r\nabove which the navigation again commences and continues\r\ngood thirty or forty miles to the mouth of Barren river.\r\n\r\n_Kentucky River_ is ninety yards wide at the mouth, and also\r\nat Boonsborough, eighty miles above. It affords a navigation\r\nfor loaded batteaux one hundred and eighty miles in a direct\r\nline, in the winter tides.\r\n\r\nThe _Great Miami_ of the Ohio, is two hundred yards wide at\r\nthe mouth. At the Piccawee towns, seventy-five miles above, it\r\nis reduced to thirty yards; it is, nevertheless, navigable for loaded\r\ncanoes fifty miles above these towns. The portage from its\r\nwestern branch into the Miami of Lake Erie, is five miles; that\r\nfrom its eastern branch into Sandusky river, is of nine miles.\r\n\r\n_Salt River_ is at all times navigable for loaded batteaux seventy\r\nor eighty miles. It is eighty yards wide at its mouth, and keeps\r\nthat width to its fork, twenty-five miles above.\r\n\r\nThe _Little Miami_ of the Ohio, is sixty or seventy yards wide\r\nat its mouth, sixty miles to its source, and affords no navigation.\r\n\r\nThe _Sioto_ is two hundred and fifty yards wide at its mouth,\r\nwhich is in latitude 38° 22', and at the Saltlick towns, two hundred\r\nmiles above the mouth, it is yet one hundred yards wide.\r\nTo these towns it is navigable for loaded batteaux, and its eastern\r\nbranch affords navigation almost to its source.\r\n\r\n_Great Sandy River_ is about sixty yards wide, and navigable\r\nsixty miles for loaded batteaux.\r\n\r\n_Guiandot_ is about the width of the river last mentioned, but\r\nis more rapid. It may be navigated by canoes sixty miles.\r\n\r\nThe _Great Kanhaway_ is a river of considerable note for the\r\nfertility of its lands, and still more, as leading towards the head\r\nwaters of James river. Nevertheless, it is doubtful whether its\r\ngreat and numerous rapids will admit a navigation, but at an expense\r\nto which it will require ages to render its inhabitants\r\nequal. The great obstacles begin at what are called the Great\r\nFalls, ninety miles above the mouth, below which are only five\r\nor six rapids, and these passable, with some difficulty, even at\r\nlow water. From the falls to the mouth of Greenbriar is one\r\nhundred miles, and thence to the lead mines one hundred and\r\ntwenty. It is two hundred and eighty yards wide at its mouth.\r\n\r\n_Hockhocking_ is eighty yards wide at its mouth, and yields\r\nnavigation for loaded batteaux to the Press-place, sixty miles\r\nabove its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe _Little Kanhaway_ is one hundred and fifty yards wide\r\nat the mouth. It yields a navigation of ten miles only. Perhaps\r\nits northern branch, called Junius' creek, which interlocks\r\nwith the western of Monongahela, may one day admit a shorter\r\npassage from the latter into the Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe _Muskingum_ is two hundred and eighty yards wide at its\r\nmouth, and two hundred yards at the lower Indian towns, one\r\nhundred and fifty miles upwards. It is navigable for small batteaux\r\nto within one mile of a navigable part of Cuyahoga river,\r\nwhich runs into Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nAt Fort Pitt the river Ohio loses its name, branching into the\r\nMonongahela and Alleghany.\r\n\r\nThe _Monongahela_ is four hundred yards wide at its mouth.\r\nFrom thence is twelve or fifteen miles to the mouth of Yohogany,\r\nwhere it is three hundred yards wide. Thence to Redstone\r\nby water is fifty miles, by land thirty. Then to the mouth\r\nof Cheat river by water forty miles, by land twenty-eight, the\r\nwidth continuing at three hundred yards, and the navigation\r\ngood for boats. Thence the width is about two hundred yards\r\nto the western fork, fifty miles higher, and the navigation frequently\r\ninterrupted by rapids, which, however, with a swell of\r\ntwo or three feet, become very passable for boats. It then admits\r\nlight boats, except in dry seasons, sixty-five miles further\r\nto the head of Tygart's valley, presenting only some small rapids\r\nand falls of one or two feet perpendicular, and lessening in its\r\nwidth to twenty yards. The _Western fork_ is navigable in the\r\nwinter ten or fifteen miles towards the northern of the Little\r\nKanhaway, and will admit a good wagon road to it. The _Yahogany_\r\nis the principal branch of this river. It passes through\r\nthe Laurel mountain, about thirty miles from its mouth; is so\r\nfar from three hundred to one hundred and fifty yards wide, and\r\nthe navigation much obstructed in dry weather by rapids and\r\nshoals. In its passage through the mountain it makes very great\r\nfalls, admitting no navigation for ten miles to the Turkey Foot.\r\nThence to the Great Crossing, about twenty miles, it is again\r\nnavigable, except in dry seasons, and at this place is two hundred\r\nyards wide. The sources of this river are divided from\r\nthose of the Potomac by the Alleghany mountain. From the\r\nfalls, where it intersects the Laurel mountain, to Fort Cumberland,\r\nthe head of the navigation on the Potomac, is forty miles\r\nof very mountainous road. Wills' creek, at the mouth of which\r\nwas Fort Cumberland, is thirty or forty yards wide, but affords\r\nno navigation as yet. _Cheat_ river, another considerable branch\r\nof the Monongahela, is two hundred yards wide at its mouth,\r\nand one hundred yards at the _Dunkard's_ settlement, fifty miles\r\nhigher. It is navigable for boats, except in dry seasons. The\r\nboundary between Virginia and Pennsylvania crosses it about\r\nthree or four miles above its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe _Alleghany_ river, with a slight swell, affords navigation\r\nfor light batteaux to Venango, at the mouth of French Creek,\r\nwhere it is two hundred yards wide, and is practised even to Le\r\nBœuf, from whence there is a portage of fifteen miles to Presque\r\nIsle on the Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nThe country watered by the Mississippi and its eastern\r\nbranches, constitutes five-eighths of the United States, two of\r\nwhich five-eighths are occupied by the Ohio and its waters; the\r\nresiduary streams which run into the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic,\r\nand the St. Lawrence, water the remaining three-eighths.\r\n\r\nBefore we quit the subject of the western waters, we will take\r\na view of their principal connections with the Atlantic. These\r\nare three; the Hudson river, the Potomac, and the Mississippi\r\nitself. Down the last will pass all heavy commodities. But the\r\nnavigation through the Gulf of Mexico is so dangerous, and that\r\nup the Mississippi so difficult and tedious, that it is thought probable\r\nthat European merchandise will not return through that\r\nchannel. It is most likely that flour, timber, and other heavy\r\narticles will be floated on rafts, which will themselves be an article\r\nfor sale as well as their loading, the navigators returning by\r\nland, or in light batteaux. There will, therefore, be a competition\r\nbetween the Hudson and Potomac rivers for the residue of\r\nthe commerce of all the country westward of Lake Erie, on the\r\nwaters of the lakes, of the Ohio, and upper parts of the Mississippi.\r\nTo go to New York, that part of the trade which comes\r\nfrom the lakes or their waters, must first be brought into Lake\r\nErie. Between Lake Superior and its waters and Huron, are the\r\nrapids of St. Mary, which will permit boats to pass, but not larger\r\nvessels. Lakes Huron and Michigan afford communication with\r\nLake Erie by vessels of eight feet draught. That part of the\r\ntrade which comes from the waters of the Mississippi must pass\r\nfrom them through some portage into the waters of the lakes.\r\nThe portage from the Illinois river into a water of Michigan is\r\nof one mile only. From the Wabash, Miami, Muskingum, or\r\nAlleghany, are portages into the waters of Lake Erie, of from one\r\nto fifteen miles. When the commodities are brought into, and\r\nhave passed through Lake Erie, there is between that and Ontario\r\nan interruption by the falls of Niagara, where the portage\r\nis of eight miles; and between Ontario and the Hudson river are\r\nportages at the falls of Onondago, a little above Oswego, of a\r\nquarter of a mile; from Wood creek to the Mohawks river two\r\nmiles; at the little falls of the Mohawks river half a mile; and\r\nfrom Schenectady to Albany sixteen miles. Besides the increase\r\nof expense occasioned by frequent change of carriage, there is an\r\nincreased risk of pillage produced by committing merchandise\r\nto a greater number of hands successively. The Potomac offers\r\nitself under the following circumstances: For the trade of the\r\nlakes and their waters westward of Lake Erie, when it shall\r\nhave entered that lake, it must coast along its southern shore, on\r\naccount of the number and excellence of its harbors; the northern,\r\nthough shortest, having few harbors, and these unsafe.\r\nHaving reached Cuyahoga, to proceed on to New York it will\r\nhave eight hundred and twenty-five miles and five portages;\r\nwhereas it is but four hundred and twenty-five miles to Alexandria,\r\nits emporium on the Potomac, if it turns into the Cuyahoga,\r\nand passes through that, Big Beaver, Ohio, Yohogany, (or\r\nMonongahela and Cheat,) and Potomac, and there are but two\r\nportages; the first of which, between Cuyahoga and Beaver, may\r\nbe removed by uniting the sources of these waters, which are\r\nlakes in the neighborhood of each other, and in a champaign\r\ncountry; the other from the waters of Ohio to Potomac will be\r\nfrom fifteen to forty miles, according to the trouble which shall\r\nbe taken to approach the two navigations. For the trade of the\r\nOhio, or that which shall come into it from its own waters or\r\nthe Mississippi, it is nearer through the Potomac to Alexandria\r\nthan to New York by five hundred and eighty miles, and it is\r\ninterrupted by one portage only. There is another circumstance\r\nof difference too. The lakes themselves never freeze, but the\r\ncommunications between them freeze, and the Hudson river is\r\nitself shut up by the ice three months in the year; whereas the\r\nchannel to the Chesapeake leads directly into a warmer climate.\r\nThe southern parts of it very rarely freeze at all, and whenever\r\nthe northern do, it is so near the sources of the rivers, that the frequent\r\nfloods to which they are there liable, break up the ice immediately,\r\nso that vessels may pass through the whole winter,\r\nsubject only to accidental and short delays. Add to all this,\r\nthat in case of war with our neighbors, the Anglo-Americans or\r\nthe Indians, the route to New York becomes a frontier through\r\nalmost its whole length, and all commerce through it ceases\r\nfrom that moment. But the channel to New York is already\r\nknown to practice, whereas the upper waters of the Ohio and the\r\nPotomac, and the great falls of the latter, are yet to be cleared\r\nof their fixed obstructions. (A.)\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY III.\r\n\r\n_A notice of the best Seaports of the State, and how big are the\r\nvessels they can receive?_\r\n\r\nHaving no ports but our rivers and creeks, this _Query_ has\r\nbeen answered under the preceding one.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY IV.\r\n\r\n_A notice of its Mountains?_\r\n\r\nFor the particular geography of our mountains I must refer\r\nto Fry and Jefferson's map of Virginia; and to Evans' analysis\r\nof this map of America, for a more philosophical view of them\r\nthan is to be found in any other work. It is worthy of notice,\r\nthat our mountains are not solitary and scattered confusedly over\r\nthe face of the country; but that they commence at about one\r\nhundred and fifty miles from the sea-coast, are disposed in\r\nridges, one behind another, running nearly parallel with the sea-coast,\r\nthough rather approaching it as they advance north-eastwardly.\r\nTo the south-west, as the tract of country between the\r\nsea-coast and the Mississippi becomes narrower, the mountains\r\nconverge into a single ridge, which, as it approaches the Gulf of\r\nMexico, subsides into plain country, and gives rise to some of\r\nthe waters of that gulf, and particularly to a river called the\r\nApalachicola, probably from the Apalachies, an Indian nation\r\nformerly residing on it. Hence the mountains giving rise to\r\nthat river, and seen from its various parts, were called the Appalachian\r\nmountains, being in fact the end or termination only of\r\nthe great ridges passing through the continent. European geographers,\r\nhowever, extended the name northwardly as far as the\r\nmountains extended; some giving it, after their separation into\r\ndifferent ridges, to the Blue Ridge, others to the North Mountain,\r\nothers to the Alleghany, others to the Laurel Ridge, as may be\r\nseen by their different maps. But the fact I believe is, that none\r\nof these ridges were ever known by that name to the inhabitants,\r\neither native or emigrant, but as they saw them so called\r\nin European maps. In the same direction, generally, are the\r\nveins of limestone, coal, and other minerals hitherto discovered;\r\nand so range the falls of our great rivers. But the courses of the\r\ngreat rivers are at right angles with these. James and Potomac\r\npenetrate through all the ridges of mountains eastward of the\r\nAlleghany; that is, broken by no water course. It is in fact the\r\nspine of the country between the Atlantic on one side, and the\r\nMississippi and St. Lawrence on the other. The passage of the\r\nPotomac through the Blue Ridge is, perhaps, one of the most stupendous\r\nscenes in nature. You stand on a very high point of land.\r\nOn your right comes up the Shenandoah, having ranged along the\r\nfoot of the mountain an hundred miles to seek a vent. On your left\r\napproaches the Potomac, in quest of a passage also. In the moment\r\nof their junction, they rush together against the mountain,\r\nrend it asunder, and pass off to the sea. The first glance of this\r\nscene hurries our senses into the opinion, that this earth has been\r\ncreated in time, that the mountains were formed first, that the\r\nrivers began to flow afterwards, that in this place, particularly,\r\nthey have been dammed up by the Blue Ridge of mountains,\r\nand have formed an ocean which filled the whole valley; that\r\ncontinuing to rise they have at length broken over at this spot,\r\nand have torn the mountain down from its summit to its base.\r\nThe piles of rock on each hand, but particularly on the Shenandoah,\r\nthe evident marks of their disrupture and avulsion from\r\ntheir beds by the most powerful agents of nature, corroborate the\r\nimpression. But the distant finishing which nature has given to\r\nthe picture, is of a very different character. It is a true contrast\r\nto the foreground. It is as placid and delightful as that is wild\r\nand tremendous. For the mountain being cloven asunder, she\r\npresents to your eye, through the cleft, a small catch of smooth\r\nblue horizon, at an infinite distance in the plain country, inviting\r\nyou, as it were, from the riot and tumult roaring around, to pass\r\nthrough the breach and participate of the calm below. Here\r\nthe eye ultimately composes itself; and that way, too, the road\r\nhappens actually to lead. You cross the Potomac above the\r\njunction, pass along its side through the base of the mountain\r\nfor three miles, its terrible precipices hanging in fragments over\r\nyou, and within about twenty miles reach Fredericktown, and the\r\nfine country round that. This scene is worth a voyage across\r\nthe Atlantic. Yet here, as in the neighborhood of the Natural\r\nBridge, are people who have passed their lives within half a\r\ndozen miles, and have never been to survey these monuments of\r\na war between rivers and mountains, which must have shaken\r\nthe earth itself to its centre. (B.)\r\n\r\nThe height of our mountains has not yet been estimated with\r\nany degree of exactness. The Alleghany being the great ridge\r\nwhich divides the waters of the Atlantic from those of the Mississippi,\r\nits summit is doubtless more elevated above the ocean than\r\nthat of any other mountain. But its relative height, compared\r\nwith the base on which it stands, is not so great as that of some\r\nothers, the country rising behind the successive ridges like the\r\nsteps of stairs. The mountains of the Blue Ridge, and of these\r\nthe Peaks of Otter, are thought to be of a greater height, measured\r\nfrom their base, than any others in our country, and perhaps\r\nin North America. From data, which may found a tolerable\r\nconjecture, we suppose the highest peak to be about four thousand\r\nfeet perpendicular, which is not a fifth part of the height of the\r\nmountains of South America, nor one-third of the height which\r\nwould be necessary in our latitude to preserve ice in the open\r\nair unmelted through the year. The ridge of mountains next\r\nbeyond the Blue Ridge, called by us the North mountain, is of\r\nthe greatest extent; for which reason they were named by the\r\nIndians the endless mountains.\r\n\r\nA substance supposed to be Pumice, found floating on the\r\nMississippi, has induced a conjecture that there is a volcano on\r\nsome of its waters; and as these are mostly known to their\r\nsources, except the Missouri, our expectations of verifying the conjecture\r\nwould of course be led to the mountains which divide\r\nthe waters of the Mexican Gulf from those of the South Sea;\r\nbut no volcano having ever yet been known at such a distance\r\nfrom the sea, we must rather suppose that this floating substance\r\nhas been erroneously deemed Pumice.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY V.\r\n\r\n_Its Cascades and Caverns?_\r\n\r\nThe only remarkable cascade in this country is that of the\r\nFalling Spring in Augusta. It is a water of James' river where\r\nit is called Jackson's river, rising in the warm spring mountains,\r\nabout twenty miles south west of the warm spring, and flowing\r\ninto that valley. About three-quarters of a mile from its source\r\nit falls over a rock two hundred feet into the valley below. The\r\nsheet of water is broken in its breadth by the rock, in two or\r\nthree places, but not at all in its height. Between the sheet and\r\nthe rock, at the bottom, you may walk across dry. This cataract\r\nwill bear no comparison with that of Niagara as to the\r\nquantity of water composing it; the sheet being only twelve or\r\nfifteen feet wide above and somewhat more spread below; but\r\nit is half as high again, the latter being only one hundred and\r\nfifty-six feet, according to the mensuration made by order of\r\nM. Vaudreuil, Governor of Canada, and one hundred and thirty\r\naccording to a more recent account.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: An eye draught of Madison's cave on a scale of\r\n   67 feet to the inch. The arrows show\r\n   where it descends or ascends.]\r\n\r\nIn the lime-stone country there are many caverns of very considerable\r\nextent. The most noted is called Madison's Cave, and is on the north side\r\nof the Blue Ridge, near the intersection of the Rockingham and Augusta\r\nline with the south fork of the southern river of Shenandoah. It is in\r\na hill of about two hundred feet perpendicular height, the ascent of\r\nwhich, on one side, is so steep that you may pitch a biscuit from its\r\nsummit into the river which washes its base. The entrance of the cave\r\nis, in this side, about two-thirds of the way up. It extends into the\r\nearth about three hundred feet, branching into subordinate caverns,\r\nsometimes ascending a little, but more generally descending, and at length\r\nterminates, in two different places, at basins of water of unknown extent,\r\nand which I should judge to be nearly on a level with the water of the\r\nriver; however, I do not think they are formed by refluent water from\r\nthat, because they are never turbid; because they do not rise and fall\r\nin correspondence with that in times of flood or of drought; and because\r\nthe water is always cool. It is probably one of the many reservoirs with\r\nwhich the interior parts of the earth are supposed to abound, and yield\r\nsupplies to the fountains of water, distinguished from others only by\r\nbeing accessible. The vault of this cave is of solid lime-stone, from\r\ntwenty to forty or fifty feet high; through which water is continually\r\npercolating. This, trickling down the sides of the cave, has incrusted\r\nthem over in the form of elegant drapery; and dripping from the top\r\nof the vault generates on that and on the base below, stalactites of a\r\nconical form, some of which have met and formed massive columns.\r\n\r\nAnother of these caves is near the north mountain, in the county\r\nof Frederic, on the lands of Mr. Zane. The entrance into\r\nthis is on the top of an extensive ridge. You descend thirty or\r\nforty feet, as into a well, from whence the cave extends, nearly\r\nhorizontally, four hundred feet into the earth, preserving a breadth\r\nof from twenty to fifty feet, and a height of from five to twelve\r\nfeet. After entering this cave a few feet, the mercury, which in\r\nthe open air was 50°, rose to 57° of Fahrenheit's thermometer,\r\nanswering to 11° of Reaumur's, and it continued at that to the\r\nremotest parts of the cave. The uniform temperature of the\r\ncellars of the observatory of Paris, which are ninety feet deep,\r\nand of all subterraneous cavities of any depth, where no chemical\r\nagencies may be supposed to produce a factitious heat, has\r\nbeen found to be 10° of Reaumur, equal to 54½° of Fahrenheit.\r\nThe temperature of the cave above mentioned so nearly corresponds\r\nwith this, that the difference may be ascribed to a difference\r\nof instruments.\r\n\r\nAt the Panther gap, in the ridge which divides the waters of\r\nthe Crow and the Calf pasture, is what is called the _Blowing\r\nCave_. It is in the side of a hill, is of about one hundred feet\r\ndiameter, and emits constantly a current of air of such force as\r\nto keep the weeds prostrate to the distance of twenty yards before\r\nit. This current is strongest in dry, frosty weather, and in\r\nlong spells of rain weakest. Regular inspirations and expirations\r\nof air, by caverns and fissures, have been probably enough\r\naccounted for by supposing them combined with intermitting\r\nfountains; as they must of course inhale air while their reservoirs\r\nare emptying themselves, and again emit it while they are filling.\r\nBut a constant issue of air, only varying in its force as the\r\nweather is drier or damper, will require a new hypothesis. There\r\nis another blowing cave in the Cumberland mountain, about a\r\nmile from where it crosses the Carolina line. All we know of\r\nthis is, that it is not constant, and that a fountain of water issues\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\nThe _Natural Bridge_, the most sublime of nature's works,\r\nthough not comprehended under the present head, must not be\r\npretermitted. It is on the ascent of a hill, which seems to have\r\nbeen cloven through its length by some great convulsion. The\r\nfissure, just at the bridge, is, by some admeasurements, two hundred\r\nand seventy feet deep, by others only two hundred and five.\r\nIt is about forty-five feet wide at the bottom and ninety feet at\r\nthe top; this of course determines the length of the bridge,\r\nand its height from the water. Its breadth in the middle is\r\nabout sixty feet, but more at the ends, and the thickness of the\r\nmass, at the summit of the arch, about forty feet. A part of\r\nthis thickness is constituted by a coat of earth, which gives\r\ngrowth to many large trees. The residue, with the hill on both\r\nsides, is one solid rock of lime-stone. The arch approaches the\r\nsemi-elliptical form; but the larger axis of the ellipsis, which\r\nwould be the cord of the arch, is many times longer than the\r\ntransverse. Though the sides of this bridge are provided in some\r\nparts with a parapet of fixed rocks, yet few men have resolution\r\nto walk to them, and look over into the abyss. You involuntarily\r\nfall on your hands and feet, creep to the parapet, and peep\r\nover it. Looking down from this height about a minute, gave\r\nme a violent head-ache. If the view from the top be painful\r\nand intolerable, that from below is delightful in an equal extreme.\r\nIt is impossible for the emotions arising from the sublime\r\nto be felt beyond what they are here; so beautiful an arch,\r\nso elevated, so light, and springing as it were up to heaven! the\r\nrapture of the spectator is really indescribable! The fissure continuing\r\nnarrow, deep, and straight, for a considerable distance\r\nabove and below the bridge, opens a short but very pleasing view\r\nof the North mountain on one side and the Blue Ridge on the\r\nother, at the distance each of them of about five miles. This\r\nbridge is in the county of Rockbridge, to which it has given\r\nname, and affords a public and commodious passage over a valley\r\nwhich cannot be crossed elsewhere for a considerable distance.\r\nThe stream passing under it is called Cedar-creek. It is\r\na water of James' river, and sufficient in the driest seasons to\r\nturn a grist-mill, though its fountain is not more than two miles\r\nabove.[2]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [2] Don Ulloa mentions a break, similar to this, in the\r\n        province of Angaraez, in South America. It is from sixteen\r\n        to twenty-two feet wide, one hundred and eleven feet deep,\r\n        and of 1.3 miles continuance, English measure. Its breadth\r\n        at top is not sensibly greater than at bottom. But the\r\n        following fact is remarkable, and will furnish some light\r\n        for conjecturing the probable origin of our natural bridge.\r\n        \"Esta caxa, ó cauce está cortada en péna viva con tanta\r\n        precision, que las desigualdades del un lado entrantes,\r\n        corresponden á las del otro lado salientes, como si aquella\r\n        altura se hubiese abierto expresamente, con sus bueltas y\r\n        tortuosidades, para darle transito á los aguas por entre\r\n        los dos morallones que la forman; siendo tal su igualdad,\r\n        que si llegasen á juntarse se endentarian uno con otro sin\r\n        dextar hueco.\" Not. Amer. ii. § 10. Don Ulloa inclines to\r\n        the opinion that this channel has been effected by the\r\n        wearing of the water which runs through it, rather than\r\n        that the mountain should have been broken open by any\r\n        convulsion of nature. But if it had been worn by the running\r\n        of water, would not the rocks which form the sides, have\r\n        been worn plain? or if, meeting in some parts with veins\r\n        of harder stone, the water had left prominences on the one\r\n        side, would not the same cause have sometimes, or perhaps\r\n        generally, occasioned prominences on the other side also?\r\n        Yet Don Ulloa tells us, that on the other side there are\r\n        always corresponding cavities, and that these tally with the\r\n        prominences so perfectly, that, were the two sides to come\r\n        together they would fit in all their indentures, without\r\n        leaving any void. I think that this does not resemble the\r\n        effect of running water, but looks rather as if the two\r\n        sides had parted asunder. The sides of the break, over which\r\n        is the natural bridge of Virginia, consisting of a veiny\r\n        rock which yields to time, the correspondence between the\r\n        salient and re-entering inequalities, if it existed at all,\r\n        has now disappeared. This break has the advantage of the\r\n        one described by Don Ulloa in its finest circumstance; no\r\n        portion in that instance having held together, during the\r\n        separation of the other parts, so as to form a bridge over\r\n        the abyss.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY VI.\r\n\r\n_A notice of the mines and other subterraneous riches; its trees,\r\nplants, fruits, &c._\r\n\r\nI knew a single instance of gold found in this State. It was\r\ninterspersed in small specks through a lump of ore of about four\r\npounds weight, which yielded seventeen pennyweights of gold, of\r\nextraordinary ductility. This ore was found on the north side\r\nof Rappahanoc, about four miles below the falls. I never heard\r\nof any other indication of gold in its neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOn the Great Kanhaway, opposite to the mouth of Cripple\r\ncreek, and about twenty-five miles from our southern boundary,\r\nin the county of Montgomery, are mines of lead. The metal is\r\nmixed, sometimes with earth, and sometimes with rock, which\r\nrequires the force of gunpowder to open it; and is accompanied\r\nwith a portion of silver too small to be worth separation under\r\nany process hitherto attempted there. The proportion yielded is\r\nfrom fifty to eighty pounds of pure metal from one hundred\r\npounds of washed ore. The most common is that of sixty to\r\none hundred pounds. The veins are sometimes most flattering,\r\nat others they disappear suddenly and totally. They enter\r\nthe side of the hill and proceed horizontally. Two of them are\r\nwrought at present by the public, the best of which is one hundred\r\nyards under the hill. These would employ about fifty laborers\r\nto advantage. We have not, however, more than thirty\r\ngenerally, and these cultivate their own corn. They have produced\r\nsixty tons of lead in the year; but the general quantity\r\nis from twenty to twenty-five tons. The present furnace is a\r\nmile from the ore bank and on the opposite side of the river.\r\nThe ore is first wagoned to the river, a quarter of a mile, then\r\nladen on board of canoes and carried across the river, which is\r\nthere about two hundred yards wide, and then again taken into\r\nwagons and carried to the furnace. This mode was originally\r\nadopted that they might avail themselves of a good situation on\r\na creek for a pounding mill; but it would be easy to have\r\nthe furnace and pounding mill on the same side of the river,\r\nwhich would yield water, without any dam, by a canal of about\r\nhalf a mile in length. From the furnace the lead is transported\r\none hundred and thirty miles along a good road, leading through\r\nthe peaks of Otter to Lynch's ferry, or Winston's on James' river,\r\nfrom whence it is carried by water about the same distance to\r\nWestham. This land carriage may be greatly shortened, by delivering\r\nthe lead on James' river, above the Blue Ridge, from\r\nwhence a ton weight has been brought on two canoes. The\r\nGreat Kanhaway has considerable falls in the neighborhood of\r\nthe mines. About seven miles below are three falls, of three\r\nor four feet perpendicular each; and three miles above is a rapid\r\nof three miles continuance, which has been compared in its descent\r\nto the great falls of James' river. Yet it is the opinion,\r\nthat they may be laid open for useful navigation, so as to reduce\r\nvery much the portage between the Kanhaway and James'\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nA valuable lead mine is said to have been lately discovered in\r\nCumberland, below the mouth of Red river. The greatest,\r\nhowever, known in the western country, are on the Mississippi,\r\nextending from the mouth of Rock river one hundred and fifty\r\nmiles upwards. These are not wrought, the lead used in that\r\ncountry being from the banks on the Spanish side of the Mississippi,\r\nopposite to Kaskaskia.\r\n\r\nA mine of copper was once opened in the county of Amherst,\r\non the north side of James' river, and another in the opposite\r\ncountry, on the south side. However, either from bad management\r\nor the poverty of the veins, they were discontinued. We\r\nare told of a rich mine of native copper on the Ouabache, below\r\nthe upper Wiaw.\r\n\r\nThe mines of iron worked at present are Callaway's, Ross's,\r\nand Ballendine's, on the south side of James' river; Old's on the\r\nnorth side, in Albemarle; Miller's in Augusta, and Zane's in\r\nFrederic. These two last are in the valley between the Blue\r\nRidge and North mountain. Callaway's, Ross's, Miller's, and\r\nZane's make about one hundred and fifty tons of bar iron each,\r\nin the year. Ross's makes also about sixteen hundred tons of\r\npig iron annually; Ballendine's one thousand; Callaway's, Miller's,\r\nand Zane's, about six hundred each. Besides these, a\r\nforge of Mr. Hunter's, at Fredericksburg, makes about three hundred\r\ntons a year of bar iron, from pigs imported from Maryland;\r\nand Taylor's forge on Neapsco of Potomac, works in the same\r\nway, but to what extent I am not informed. The indications\r\nof iron in other places are numerous, and dispersed through all\r\nthe middle country. The toughness of the cast iron of Ross's\r\nand Zane's furnaces is very remarkable. Pots and other utensils,\r\ncast thinner than usual, of this iron, may be safely thrown\r\ninto, or out of the wagons in which they are transported. Salt-pans\r\nmade of the same, and no longer wanted for that purpose,\r\ncannot be broken up, in order to be melted again, unless previously\r\ndrilled in many parts.\r\n\r\nIn the western country, we are told of iron mines between the\r\nMuskingum and Ohio; of others on Kentucky, between the\r\nCumberland and Barren rivers, between Cumberland and Tennessee,\r\non Reedy creek, near the Long Island, and on Chesnut\r\ncreek, a branch of the Great Kanhaway, near where it crosses\r\nthe Carolina line. What are called the iron banks, on the Mississippi,\r\nare believed, by a good judge, to have no iron in them.\r\nIn general, from what is hitherto known of that country, it seems\r\nto want iron.\r\n\r\nConsiderable quantities of black lead are taken occasionally\r\nfor use from Winterham in the county of Amelia. I am not\r\nable, however, to give a particular state of the mine. There is\r\nno work established at it; those who want, going and procuring\r\nit for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe country on James' river, from fifteen to twenty miles\r\nabove Richmond, and for several miles northward and southward,\r\nis replete with mineral coal of a very excellent quality.\r\nBeing in the hands of many proprietors, pits have been opened,\r\nand, before the interruption of our commerce, were worked to\r\nan extent equal to the demand.\r\n\r\nIn the western country coal is known to be in so many places,\r\nas to have induced an opinion, that the whole tract between the\r\nLaurel mountain, Mississippi, and Ohio, yields coal. It is also\r\nknown in many places on the north side of the Ohio. The\r\ncoal at Pittsburg is of very superior quality. A bed of it at that\r\nplace has been a-fire since the year 1765. Another coal-hill on\r\nthe Pike-run of Monongahela has been a-fire ten years; yet it\r\nhas burnt away about twenty yards only.\r\n\r\nI have known one instance of an emerald found in this country.\r\nAmethysts have been frequent, and crystals common; yet\r\nnot in such numbers any of them as to be worth seeking.\r\n\r\nThere is very good marble, and in very great abundance, on\r\nJames' river, at the mouth of Rockfish. The samples I have\r\nseen, were some of them of a white as pure as one might expect\r\nto find on the surface of the earth; but most of them were variegated\r\nwith red, blue, and purple. None of it has been ever\r\nworked. It forms a very large precipice, which hangs over a\r\nnavigable part of the river. It is said there is marble at Kentucky.\r\n\r\nBut one vein of limestone is known below the Blue Ridge.\r\nIts first appearance, in our country, is in Prince William, two\r\nmiles below the Pignut ridge of mountains; thence it passes on\r\nnearly parallel with that, and crosses the Rivanna about five\r\nmiles below it, where it is called the South-west ridge. It then\r\ncrosses Hard-ware, above the mouth of Hudson's creek, James'\r\nriver at the mouth of Rockfish, at the marble quarry before\r\nspoken of, probably runs up that river to where it appears again\r\nat Ross's iron-works, and so passes off south-westwardly by Flat\r\nCreek of Otter river. It is never more than one hundred yards\r\nwide. From the Blue Ridge westwardly, the whole country\r\nseems to be founded on a rock of limestone, besides infinite\r\nquantities on the surface, both loose and fixed. This is cut into\r\nbeds, which range, as the mountains and sea-coast do, from\r\nsouth-west to north-east, the lamina of each bed declining from\r\nthe horizon towards a parallelism with the axis of the earth.\r\nBeing struck with this observation, I made, with a quadrant, a\r\ngreat number of trials on the angles of their declination, and\r\nfound them to vary from 22° to 60°; but averaging all my\r\ntrials, the result was within one-third of a degree of the elevation\r\nof the pole or latitude of the place, and much the greatest part\r\nof them taken separately were little different from that; by which\r\nit appears, that these lamina are, in the main, parallel with the\r\naxis of the earth. In some instances, indeed, I found them perpendicular,\r\nand even reclining the other way; but these were\r\nextremely rare, and always attended with signs of convulsion,\r\nor other circumstances of singularity, which admitted a possibility\r\nof removal from their original position. These trials were\r\nmade between Madison's cave and the Potomac. We hear of\r\nlimestone on the Mississippi and Ohio, and in all the mountainous\r\ncountry between the eastern and western waters, not on the\r\nmountains themselves, but occupying the valleys between them.\r\n\r\nNear the eastern foot of the North mountain are immense bodies\r\nof _Schist_; containing impressions of shells in a variety of\r\nforms. I have received petrified shells of very different kinds\r\nfrom the first sources of Kentucky, which bear no resemblance\r\nto any I have ever seen on the tide-waters. It is said that shells\r\nare found in the Andes, in South America, fifteen thousand feet\r\nabove the level of the ocean. This is considered by many, both\r\nof the learned and unlearned, as a proof of an universal deluge.\r\nTo the many considerations opposing this opinion, the following\r\nmay be added: The atmosphere, and all its contents, whether\r\nof water, air, or other matter, gravitate to the earth; that is to\r\nsay, they have weight. Experience tells us, that the weight of\r\nall these together never exceeds that of a column of mercury of\r\nthirty-one inches height, which is equal to one of rain water of\r\nthirty-five feet high. If the whole contents of the atmosphere,\r\nthen, were water, instead of what they are, it would cover the\r\nglobe but thirty-five feet deep; but as these waters, as they fell,\r\nwould run into the seas, the superficial measure of which is to\r\nthat of the dry parts of the globe, as two to one, the seas would\r\nbe raised only fifty-two and a half feet above their present level,\r\nand of course would overflow the lands to that height only. In\r\nVirginia this would be a very small proportion even of the champaign\r\ncountry, the banks of our tide-waters being frequently, if\r\nnot generally, of a greater height. Deluges beyond this extent,\r\nthen, as for instance, to the North mountain or to Kentucky,\r\nseem out of the laws of nature. But within it they may have\r\ntaken place to a greater or less degree, in proportion to the combination\r\nof natural causes which may be supposed to have produced\r\nthem. History renders probably some instances of a partial\r\ndeluge in the country lying round the Mediterranean sea.\r\nIt has been often[3] supposed, and it is not unlikely, that that sea\r\nwas once a lake. While such, let us admit an extraordinary\r\ncollection of the waters of the atmosphere from the other parts\r\nof the globe to have been discharged over that and the countries\r\nwhose waters run into it. Or without supposing it a lake, admit\r\nsuch an extraordinary collection of the waters of the atmosphere,\r\nand an influx from the Atlantic ocean, forced by long-continued\r\nwestern winds. The lake, or that sea, may thus have\r\nbeen so raised as to overflow the low lands adjacent to it, as\r\nthose of Egypt and Armenia, which, according to a tradition of\r\nthe Egyptians and Hebrews, were overflowed about two thousand\r\nthree hundred years before the Christian era; those of\r\nAttica, said to have been overflowed in the time of Ogyges,\r\nabout five hundred years later; and those of Thessaly, in the\r\ntime of Deucalion, still three hundred years posterior. But such\r\ndeluges as these will not account for the shells found in the\r\nhigher lands. A second opinion has been entertained, which is,\r\nthat in times anterior to the records either of history or tradition,\r\nthe bed of the ocean, the principal residence of the shelled tribe,\r\nhas, by some great convulsion of nature, been heaved to the\r\nheights at which we now find shells and other marine animals.\r\nThe favorers of this opinion do well to suppose the great events\r\non which it rests to have taken place beyond all the eras of history;\r\nfor within these, certainly, none such are to be found; and\r\nwe may venture to say farther, that no fact has taken place, either\r\nin our own days, or in the thousands of years recorded in history,\r\nwhich proves the existence of any natural agents, within or\r\nwithout the bowels of the earth, of force sufficient to heave, to\r\nthe height of fifteen thousand feet, such masses as the Andes.\r\nThe difference between the power necessary to produce such an\r\neffect, and that which shuffled together the different parts of\r\nCalabria in our days, is so immense, that from the existence of\r\nthe latter, we are not authorized to infer that of the former.\r\n\r\nM. de Voltaire has suggested a third solution of this difficulty.\r\n(Quest. Encycl. Coquilles.) He cites an instance in Touraine,\r\nwhere, in the space of eighty years, a particular spot of earth\r\nhad been twice metamorphosed into soft stone, which had become\r\nhard when employed in building. In this stone shells of\r\nvarious kinds were produced, discoverable at first only with a\r\nmicroscope, but afterwards growing with the stone. From this\r\nfact, I suppose, he would have us infer, that, besides the usual\r\nprocess for generating shells by the elaboration of earth and\r\nwater in animal vessels, nature may have provided an equivalent\r\noperation, by passing the same materials through the pores of\r\ncalcareous earths and stones; as we see calcareous drop-stones\r\ngenerating every day, by the percolation of water through limestone,\r\nand new marble forming in the quarries from which the\r\nold has been taken out. And it might be asked, whether is it\r\nmore difficult for nature to shoot the calcareous juice into the\r\nform of a shell, than other juices into the forms of crystals, plants,\r\nanimals, according to the construction of the vessels through\r\nwhich they pass? There is a wonder somewhere. Is it greatest\r\non this branch of the dilemma; on that which supposes the\r\nexistence of a power, of which we have no evidence in any\r\nother case; or on the first, which requires us to believe the creation\r\nof a body of water and its subsequent annihilation? The\r\nestablishment of the instance, cited by M. de Voltaire, of the\r\ngrowth of shells unattached to animal bodies, would have been\r\nthat of his theory. But he has not established it. He has not\r\neven left it on ground so respectable as to have rendered it an\r\nobject of inquiry to the _literati_ of his own country. Abandoning\r\nthis fact, therefore, the three hypotheses are equally unsatisfactory;\r\nand we must be contented to acknowledge, that this\r\ngreat phenomenon is as yet unsolved. Ignorance is preferable\r\nto error; and he is less remote from the truth who believes nothing,\r\nthan he who believes what is wrong.\r\n\r\nThere is great abundance (more especially when you approach\r\nthe mountains) of stone, white, blue, brown, &c., fit for the chisel,\r\ngood mill-stone, such also as stands the fire, and slate stone. We\r\nare told of flint, fit for gun-flints, on the Meherrin in Brunswick,\r\non the Mississippi between the mouth of the Ohio and Kaskaskia,\r\nand on others of the western waters. Isinglass or mica is in\r\nseveral places; loadstone also; and an Asbestos of a ligneous texture,\r\nis sometimes to be met with.\r\n\r\nMarle abounds generally. A clay, of which, like the Sturbridge\r\nin England, bricks are made, which will resist long the\r\nviolent action of fire, has been found on Tuckahoe creek of\r\nJames' river, and no doubt will be found in other places. Chalk\r\nis said to be in Botetourt and Bedford. In the latter county is some\r\nearth believed to be gypseous. Ochres are found in various parts.\r\n\r\nIn the lime-stone country are many caves, the earthy floors\r\nof which are impregnated with nitre. On Rich creek, a branch\r\nof the Great Kanhaway, about sixty miles below the lead mines,\r\nis a very large one, about twenty yards wide, and entering a hill\r\na quarter or half a mile. The vault is of rock, from nine to fifteen\r\nor twenty feet above the floor. A Mr. Lynch, who gives\r\nme this account, undertook to extract the nitre. Besides a coat\r\nof the salt which had formed on the vault and floor, he found\r\nthe earth highly impregnated to the depth of seven feet in some\r\nplaces, and generally of three, every bushel yielding on an average\r\nthree pounds of nitre. Mr. Lynch having made about ten\r\nhundred pounds of the salt from it, consigned it to some others,\r\nwho have since made ten thousand pounds. They have done\r\nthis by pursuing the cave into the hill, never trying a second\r\ntime the earth they have once exhausted, to see how far or soon\r\nit receives another impregnation. At least fifty of these caves\r\nare worked on the Greenbriar. There are many of them known\r\non Cumberland river.\r\n\r\nThe country westward of the Alleghany abounds with springs\r\nof common salt. The most remarkable we have heard of are\r\nat Bullet's-lick, the Big-bones, the Blue-licks, and on the north\r\nfork of Holston. The area of Bullet's-lick is of many acres.\r\nDigging the earth to the depth of three feet the water begins to\r\nboil up, and the deeper you go and the drier the weather, the\r\nstronger is the brine. A thousand gallons of water yield from a\r\nbushel to a bushel and a half of salt, which is about eighty\r\npounds of water to one pound of salt. So that sea-water is\r\nmore than three times as strong as that of these springs. A salt\r\nspring has been lately discovered at the Turkey foot on Yohogany,\r\nby which river it is overflowed, except at very low water.\r\nIts merit is not yet known. Dunning's lick is also as yet untried,\r\nbut it is supposed to be the best on this side the Ohio. The salt\r\nsprings on the margin of the Onondago lake are said to give a\r\nsaline taste to the waters of the lake.\r\n\r\nThere are several medicinal springs, some of which are indubitably\r\nefficacious, while others seem to owe their reputation\r\nas much to fancy and change of air and regimen, as to their real\r\nvirtues. None of them having undergone a chemical analysis\r\nin skilful hands, nor been so far the subject of observations as to\r\nhave produced a reduction into classes of the disorders which\r\nthey relieve; it is in my power to give little more than an enumeration\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe most efficacious of these are two springs in Augusta near\r\nthe first sources of James' river, where it is called Jackson's river.\r\nThey rise near the foot of the ridge of mountains generally\r\ncalled the Warm spring mountains, but in the maps Jackson's\r\nmountains. The one distinguished by the name of the Warm\r\nspring, and the other of the Hot spring. The Warm spring issues\r\nwith a very bold stream, sufficient to work a grist mill and\r\nto keep the waters of its basin, which is thirty feet in diameter,\r\nat the vital warmth, viz. 96° of Fahrenheit's thermometer. The\r\nmatter with which these waters is allied is very volatile; its\r\nsmell indicates it to be sulphureous, as also does the circumstance\r\nof its turning silver black. They relieve rheumatisms. Other\r\ncomplaints also of very different natures have been removed or\r\nlessened by them. It rains here four or five days in every\r\nweek.\r\n\r\nThe _Hot spring_ is about six miles from the Warm, is much\r\nsmaller, and has been so hot as to have boiled an egg. Some\r\nbelieve its degree of heat to be lessened. It raises the mercury\r\nin Fahrenheit's thermometer to 112 degrees, which is fever heat.\r\nIt sometimes relieves where the Warm fails. A fountain of common\r\nwater, issuing within a few inches of its margin, gives it a\r\nsingular appearance. Comparing the temperature of these with\r\nthat of the Hot springs of Kamschatka, of which Krachininnikow\r\ngives an account, the difference is very great, the latter raising\r\nthe mercury to 200° which is within 12° of boiling water.\r\nThese springs are very much resorted to in spite of a total want\r\nof accommodation for the sick. Their waters are strongest in\r\nthe hottest months, which occasions their being visited in July and\r\nAugust principally.\r\n\r\nThe Sweet springs are in the county of Botetourt, at the eastern\r\nfoot of the Alleghany, about forty-two miles from the Warm\r\nsprings. They are still less known. Having been found to relieve\r\ncases in which the others had been ineffectually tried, it is\r\nprobable their composition is different. They are different also\r\nin their temperature, being as cold as common water; which is\r\nnot mentioned, however, as a proof of a distinct impregnation.\r\nThis is among the first sources of James' river.\r\n\r\nOn Potomac river, in Berkley county, above the North mountain,\r\nare medicinal springs, much more frequented than those of\r\nAugusta. Their powers, however, are less, the waters weakly\r\nmineralized, and scarcely warm. They are more visited, because\r\nsituated in a fertile, plentiful, and populous country, better provided\r\nwith accommodations, always safe from the Indians, and\r\nnearest to the more populous States.\r\n\r\nIn Louisa county, on the head waters of the South Ann branch\r\nof York river, are springs of some medicinal virtue. They are\r\nnot much used however. There is a weak chalybeate at Richmond;\r\nand many others in various parts of the country, which\r\nare of too little worth, or too little note, to be enumerated after\r\nthose before mentioned.\r\n\r\nWe are told of a sulphur spring on Howard's creek of Greenbriar,\r\nand another at Boonsborough on Kentucky.\r\n\r\nIn the low grounds of the Great Kanhaway, seven miles above\r\nthe mouth of Elk river, and sixty-seven above that of the Kanhaway\r\nitself, is a hole in the earth of the capacity of thirty or\r\nforty gallons, from which issues constantly a bituminous vapor,\r\nin so strong a current as to give to the sand about its orifice the\r\nmotion which it has in a boiling spring. On presenting a lighted\r\ncandle or torch within eighteen inches of the hole it flames\r\nup in a column of eighteen inches in diameter, and four or five\r\nfeet height, which sometimes burns out within twenty minutes,\r\nand at other times has been known to continue three days, and\r\nthen has been still left burning. The flame is unsteady, of the\r\ndensity of that of burning spirits, and smells like burning pit\r\ncoal. Water sometimes collects in the basin, which is remarkably\r\ncold, and is kept in ebullition by the vapor issuing through\r\nit. If the vapor be fired in that state, the water soon becomes\r\nso warm that the hand cannot bear it, and evaporates wholly in\r\na short time. This, with the circumjacent lands, is the property\r\nof His Excellency General Washington and of General Lewis.\r\n\r\nThere is a similar one on Sandy river, the flame of which is\r\na column of about twelve inches diameter, and three feet high.\r\nGeneral Clarke, who informs me of it, kindled the vapor, staid\r\nabout an hour, and left it burning.\r\n\r\nThe mention of uncommon springs leads me to that of Syphon\r\nfountains. There is one of these near the intersection of\r\nthe Lord Fairfax's boundary with the North mountain, not far\r\nfrom Brock's gap, on the stream of which is a grist mill, which\r\ngrinds two bushel of grain at every flood of the spring; another\r\nnear Cow-pasture river, a mile and a half below its confluence\r\nwith the Bull-pasture river, and sixteen or seventeen miles from\r\nHot springs, which intermits once in every twelve hours; one\r\nalso near the mouth of the north Holston.\r\n\r\nAfter these may be mentioned the _Natural Well_, on the lands\r\nof a Mr. Lewis in Frederick county. It is somewhat larger than\r\na common well; the water rises in it as near the surface of the\r\nearth as in the neighboring artificial wells, and is of a depth as\r\nyet unknown. It is said there is a current in it tending sensibly\r\ndownwards. If this be true, it probably feeds some fountain,\r\nof which it is the natural reservoir, distinguished from others,\r\nlike that of Madison's cave, by being accessible. It is used\r\nwith a bucket and windlass as an ordinary well.\r\n\r\nA complete catalogue of the trees, plants, fruits, &c., is probably\r\nnot desired. I will sketch out those which would principally\r\nattract notice, as being first, Medicinal; second, Esculent;\r\nthird, Ornamental; or four, useful for fabrication; adding the\r\nLinnæan to the popular names, as the latter might not convey\r\nprecise information to a foreigner.

This accurate observer was\r\na native and resident of this State, passed a long life in exploring\r\nand describing its plants, and is supposed to have enlarged\r\nthe botanical catalogue as much as almost any man who has\r\nlived.\r\n\r\nBesides these plants, which are native, our _farms_ produce\r\nwheat, rye, barley, oats, buck-wheat, broom corn, and Indian\r\ncorn. The climate suits rice well enough, wherever the lands\r\ndo. Tobacco, hemp, flax, and cotton, are staple commodities.\r\nIndigo yields two cuttings. The silk-worm is a native, and the\r\nmulberry, proper for its food, grows kindly.\r\n\r\nWe cultivate, also, potatoes, both the long and the round, turnips,\r\ncarrots, parsnips, pumkins, and ground nuts (Arachis.)\r\nOur grasses are lucerne, st. foin, burnet, timothy, ray, and\r\norchard grass; red, white, and yellow clover; greensward, blue\r\ngrass, and crab grass.\r\n\r\nThe _gardens_ yield musk-melons, water-melons, tomatoes,\r\nokra, pomegranates, figs, and the esculant plants of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe _orchards_ produce apples, pears, cherries, quinces, peaches,\r\nnectarines, apricots, almonds, and plums.\r\n\r\nOur quadrupeds have been mostly described by Linnæus and\r\nMons. de Buffon. Of these the mammoth, or big buffalo, as\r\ncalled by the Indians, must certainly have been the largest.\r\nTheir tradition is, that he was carnivorous, and still exists in the\r\nnorthern parts of America. A delegation of warriors from the\r\nDelaware tribe having visited the Governor of Virginia, during\r\nthe revolution, on matters of business, after these had been discussed\r\nand settled in council, the Governor asked them some\r\nquestions relative to their country, and among others, what they\r\nknew or had heard of the animal whose bones were found at the\r\nSaltlicks on the Ohio. Their chief speaker immediately put\r\nhimself into an attitude of oratory, and with a pomp suited to\r\nwhat he conceived the elevation of his subject, informed him\r\nthat it was a tradition handed down from their fathers, \"That\r\nin ancient times a herd of these tremendous animals came to the\r\nBig-bone licks, and began an universal destruction of the bear,\r\ndeer, elks, buffaloes, and other animals which had been created\r\nfor the use of the Indians; that the Great Man above, looking\r\ndown and seeing this, was so enraged that he seized his lightning,\r\ndescended on the earth, seated himself on a neighboring\r\nmountain, on a rock of which his seat and the print of his feet\r\nare still to be seen, and hurled his bolts among them till the\r\nwhole were slaughtered, except the big bull, who presenting his\r\nforehead to the shafts, shook them off as they fell; but missing\r\none at length, it wounded him in the side; whereon, springing\r\nround, he bounded over the Ohio, over the Wabash, the Illinois,\r\nand finally over the great lakes, where he is living at this day.\"\r\nIt is well known, that on the Ohio, and in many parts of America\r\nfurther north, tusks, grinders, and skeletons of unparalleled magnitude,\r\nare found in great numbers, some lying on the surface of\r\nthe earth, and some a little below it. A Mr. Stanley, taken\r\nprisoner near the mouth of the Tennessee, relates, that after being\r\ntransferred through several tribes, from one to another, he was\r\nat length carried over the mountains west of the Missouri to a\r\nriver which runs westwardly; that these bones abounded there,\r\nand that the natives described to him the animal to which they\r\nbelonged as still existing in the northern parts of their country;\r\nfrom which description he judged it to be an elephant. Bones\r\nof the same kind have been lately found, some feet below the\r\nsurface of the earth, in salines opened on the North Holston, a\r\nbranch of the Tennessee, about the latitude of 36½° north. From\r\nthe accounts published in Europe, I suppose it to be decided\r\nthat these are of the same kind with those found in Siberia.\r\nInstances are mentioned of like animal remains found in the\r\nmore southern climates of both hemispheres; but they are either\r\nso loosely mentioned as to leave a doubt of the fact, so inaccurately\r\ndescribed as not to authorize the classing them with the\r\ngreat northern bones, or so rare as to found a suspicion that they\r\nhave been carried thither as curiosities from the northern regions.\r\nSo that, on the whole, there seem to be no certain vestiges of\r\nthe existence of this animal farther south than the salines just\r\nmentioned. It is remarkable that the tusks and skeletons have\r\nbeen ascribed by the naturalists of Europe to the elephant, while\r\nthe grinders have been given to the hippopotamus, or river horse.\r\nYet it is acknowledged, that the tusks and skeletons are much\r\nlarger than those of the elephant, and the grinders many times\r\ngreater than those of the hippopotamus, and essentially different\r\nin form. Wherever these grinders are found, there also we find\r\nthe tusks and skeleton; but no skeleton of the hippopotamus nor\r\ngrinders of the elephant. It will not be said that the hippopotamus\r\nand elephant came always to the same spot, the former to\r\ndeposit his grinders, and the latter his tusks and skeleton. For\r\nwhat became of the parts not deposited there? We must agree\r\nthen, that these remains belong to each other, that they are of\r\none and the same animal, that this was not a hippopotamus, because\r\nthe hippopotamus had no tusks, nor such a frame, and because\r\nthe grinders differ in their size as well as in the number\r\nand form of their points. That this was not an elephant, I think\r\nascertained by proofs equally decisive. I will not avail myself\r\nof the authority of the celebrated[4] anatomist, who, from an examination\r\nof the form and structure of the tusks, has declared\r\nthey were essentially different from those of the elephant; because\r\nanother[5] anatomist, equally celebrated, has declared, on a\r\nlike examination, that they are precisely the same. Between\r\ntwo such authorities I will suppose this circumstance equivocal.\r\nBut, 1. The skeleton of the mammoth (for so the incognitum\r\nhas been called) bespeaks an animal of five or six times the cubic\r\nvolume of the elephant, as Mons. de Buffon has admitted. 2.\r\nThe grinders are five times as large, are square, and the grinding\r\nsurface studded with four or five rows of blunt points; whereas those\r\nof the elephant are broad and thin, and their grinding surface flat.\r\n3. I have never heard an instance, and suppose there has been\r\nnone, of the grinder of an elephant being found in America. 4.\r\nFrom the known temperature and constitution of the elephant,\r\nhe could never have existed in those regions where the remains\r\nof the mammoth have been found. The elephant is a native\r\nonly of the torrid zone and its vicinities; if, with the assistance\r\nof warm apartments and warm clothing, he has been preserved\r\nin the temperate climates of Europe, it has only been for a\r\nsmall portion of what would have been his natural period, and\r\nno instance of his multiplication in them has ever been known.\r\nBut no bones of the mammoth, as I have before observed, have\r\nbeen ever found further south than the salines of Holston, and\r\nthey have been found as far north as the Arctic circle. Those,\r\ntherefore, who are of opinion that the elephant and mammoth\r\nare the same, must believe, 1. That the elephant known to us\r\ncan exist and multiply in the frozen zone; or, 2. That an eternal\r\nfire may once have warmed those regions, and since abandoned\r\nthem, of which, however, the globe exhibits no unequivocal indications;\r\nor, 3. That the obliquity of the ecliptic, when these\r\nelephants lived, was so great as to include within the tropics all\r\nthose regions in which the bones are found; the tropics being,\r\nas is before observed, the natural limits of habitation for the elephant.\r\nBut if it be admitted that this obliquity has really decreased,\r\nand we adopt the highest rate of decrease yet pretended,\r\nthat is, of one minute in a century, to transfer the northern tropic\r\nto the Arctic circle, would carry the existence of these supposed\r\nelephants two hundred and fifty thousand years back; a period\r\nfar beyond our conception of the duration of animal bones less\r\nexposed to the open air than these are in many instances. Besides,\r\nthough these regions would then be supposed within the\r\ntropics, yet their winters would have been too severe for the\r\nsensibility of the elephant. They would have had, too, but one\r\nday and one night in the year, a circumstance to which we have\r\nno reason to suppose the nature of the elephant fitted. However,\r\nit has been demonstrated, that, if a variation of obliquity\r\nin the ecliptic takes place at all, it is vibratory, and never exceeds\r\nthe limits of nine degrees, which is not sufficient to bring\r\nthese bones within the tropics. One of these hypotheses, or\r\nsome other equally voluntary and inadmissible to cautious philosophy,\r\nmust be adopted to support the opinion that these are the\r\nbones of the elephant. For my own part, I find it easier to believe\r\nthat an animal may have existed, resembling the elephant\r\nin his tusks, and general anatomy, while his nature was in other\r\nrespects extremely different. From the 30th degree of south\r\nlatitude to the 30th degree of north, are nearly the limits which\r\nnature has fixed for the existence and multiplication of the elephant\r\nknown to us. Proceeding thence northwardly to 36½ degrees,\r\nwe enter those assigned to the mammoth. The farther\r\nwe advance north, the more their vestiges multiply as far as the\r\nearth has been explored in that direction; and it is as probable\r\nas otherwise, that this progression continues to the pole itself, if\r\nland extends so far. The centre of the frozen zone, then, may\r\nbe the acme of their vigor, as that of the torrid is of the elephant.\r\nThus nature seems to have drawn a belt of separation\r\nbetween these two tremendous animals, whose breadth, indeed,\r\nis not precisely known, though at present we may suppose it\r\nabout 6½ degrees of latitude; to have assigned to the elephant\r\nthe regions south of these confines, and those north to the\r\nmammoth, founding the constitution of the one in her extreme\r\nof heat, and that of the other in the extreme of cold.\r\nWhen the Creator has therefore separated their nature as far as\r\nthe extent of the scale of animal life allowed to this planet would\r\npermit, it seems perverse to declare it the same, from a partial\r\nresemblance of their tusks and bones. But to whatever animal\r\nwe ascribe these remains, it is certain such a one has existed in\r\nAmerica, and that it has been the largest of all terrestrial beings.\r\nIt should have sufficed to have rescued the earth it inhabited,\r\nand the atmosphere it breathed, from the imputation of impotence\r\nin the conception and nourishment of animal life on a large\r\nscale; to have stifled, in its birth, the opinion of a writer, the\r\nmost learned, too, of all others in the science of animal history,\r\nthat in the new world, \"La nature vivante est beaucoup moins\r\nagissante, beaucoup moins forte:\"[6] that nature is less active, less\r\nenergetic on one side of the globe than she is on the other. As\r\nif both sides were not warmed by the same genial sun; as if a\r\nsoil of the same chemical composition was less capable of elaboration\r\ninto animal nutriment; as if the fruits and grains from\r\nthat soil and sun yielded a less rich chyle, gave less extension\r\nto the solids and fluids of the body, or produced sooner in the\r\ncartilages, membranes, and fibres, that rigidity which restrains all\r\nfurther extension, and terminates animal growth. The truth is,\r\nthat a pigmy and a Patagonian, a mouse and a mammoth, derive\r\ntheir dimensions from the same nutritive juices. The difference\r\nof increment depends on circumstances unsearchable to beings\r\nwith our capacities. Every race of animals seems to have received\r\nfrom their Maker certain laws of extension at the time of\r\ntheir formation. Their elaborate organs were formed to produce\r\nthis, while proper obstacles were opposed to its further progress.\r\nBelow these limits they cannot fall, nor rise above them. What\r\nintermediate station they shall take may depend on soil, on\r\nclimate, on food, on a careful choice of breeders. But all the\r\nmanna of heaven would never raise the mouse to the bulk of\r\nthe mammoth.\r\n\r\nThe opinion advanced by the Count de Buffon,[7] is 1. That\r\nthe animals common both to the old and new world are smaller\r\nin the latter. 2. That those peculiar to the new are on a smaller\r\nscale. 3. That those which have been domesticated in both\r\nhave degenerated in America; and 4. That on the whole it exhibits\r\nfewer species. And the reason he thinks is, that the heats\r\nof America are less; that more waters are spread over its surface\r\nby nature, and fewer of these drained off by the hand of man.\r\nIn other words, that _heat_ is friendly, and _moisture_ adverse to the\r\nproduction and development of large quadrupeds. I will not\r\nmeet this hypothesis on its first doubtful ground, whether the\r\nclimate of America be comparatively more humid? Because\r\nwe are not furnished with observations sufficient to decide this\r\nquestion. And though, till it be decided, we are as free to deny\r\nas others are to affirm the fact, yet for a moment let it be supposed.\r\nThe hypothesis, after this supposition, proceeds to another;\r\nthat _moisture_ is unfriendly to animal growth. The truth of\r\nthis is inscrutable to us by reasonings _à priori_. Nature has\r\nhidden from us her _modus agendi_. Our only appeal on such\r\nquestions is to experience; and I think that experience is against\r\nthe supposition. It is by the assistance of _heat_ and _moisture_\r\nthat vegetables are elaborated from the elements of earth, air,\r\nwater, and fire. We accordingly see the more humid climates\r\nproduce the greater quantity of vegetables. Vegetables are mediately\r\nor immediately the food of every animal; and in proportion\r\nto the quantity of food, we see animals not only multiplied\r\nin their numbers, but improved in their bulk, as far as the\r\nlaws of their nature will admit. Of this opinion is the Count\r\nde Buffon himself in another part of his work;[8] \"en general il\r\nparoit ques les pays un peu _froids_ conviennent mieux á nos\r\nboeufs que les pays chauds, et qu'ils sont d'autant plus gross et\r\nplus grands que le climat est plus _humide_ et plus abondans en\r\npaturages. Les boeufs de Danemarck, de la Podolie, de l'Ulkraine\r\net de la Tartarie qu habitent les Calmouques sont les plus\r\ngrands de tous.\" Here then a race of animals, and one of the\r\nlargest too, has been increased in its dimensions by _cold_ and\r\n_moisture_, in direct opposition to the hypothesis, which supposes\r\nthat these two circumstances diminish animal bulk, and that it is\r\ntheir contraries _heat_ and _dryness_ which enlarge it. But when\r\nwe appeal to experience we are not to rest satisfied with a single\r\nfact. Let us, therefore, try our question on more general\r\nground. Let us take two portions of the earth, Europe and\r\nAmerica for instance, sufficiently extensive to give operation to\r\ngeneral causes; let us consider the circumstances peculiar to\r\neach, and observe their effect on animal nature. America, running\r\nthrough the torrid as well as temperate zone, has more _heat_\r\ncollectively taken, than Europe. But Europe, according to our\r\nhypothesis, is the _dryest_. They are equally adapted then to\r\nanimal productions; each being endowed with one of those\r\ncauses which befriend animal growth, and with one which opposes\r\nit. If it be thought unequal to compare Europe with\r\nAmerica, which is so much larger, I answer, not more so than to\r\ncompare America with the whole world. Besides, the purpose\r\nof the comparison is to try an hypothesis, which makes the size\r\nof animals depend on the _heat_ and _moisture_ of climate. If,\r\ntherefore, we take a region so extensive as to comprehend a sensible\r\ndistinction of climate, and so extensive too as that local accidents,\r\nor the intercourse of animals on its borders, may not\r\nmaterially affect the size of those in its interior parts, we shall\r\ncomply with those conditions which the hypothesis may reasonably\r\ndemand. The objection would be the weaker in the present\r\ncase, because any intercourse of animals which may take place\r\non the confines of Europe and Asia, is to the advantage of the\r\nformer, Asia producing certainly larger animals than Europe.\r\nLet us then take a comparative view of the quadrupeds of Europe\r\nand America, presenting them to the eye in three different\r\ntables, in one of which shall be enumerated those found in both\r\ncountries; in a second, those found in one only; in a third,\r\nthose which have been domesticated in both. To facilitate the\r\ncomparison, let those of each table be arranged in gradation according\r\nto their sizes, from the greatest to the smallest, so far as\r\ntheir sizes can be conjectured. The weights of the large animals\r\nshall be expressed in the English avoirdupois and its decimals;\r\nthose of the smaller, in the same ounce and its decimals.\r\nThose which are marked thus *, are actual weights of particular\r\nsubjects, deemed among the largest of their species. Those\r\nmarked thus †, are furnished by judicious persons, well acquainted\r\nwith the species, and saying, from conjecture only, what the\r\nlargest individual they had seen would probably have weighed.\r\nThe other weights are taken from Messrs. Buffon and D'Aubenton,\r\nand are of such subjects as came casually to their hands for\r\ndissection. This circumstance must be remembered where their\r\nweights and mine stand opposed; the latter being stated not to\r\nproduce a conclusion in favor of the American species, but to\r\njustify a suspension of opinion until we are better informed, and\r\na suspicion, in the meantime, that there is no uniform difference\r\nin favor of either; which is all I pretend.\r\n\r\n_A comparative view of the Quadrupeds of Europe and of\r\nAmerica._\r\n\r\n     I.

This should therefore have corrected\r\nthe generality of his expressions, XVIII. 145, and elsewhere,\r\nthat the animals common to the two countries, are considerably\r\nless in America than in Europe, \"et cela sans aucune\r\nexception.\" He tells us too, [Quadrup. VIII. 334, edit. Paris,\r\n1777,] that on examining a bear from America, he remarked no\r\ndifference, \"dans _la forme_ de cet ours d'Amerique comparé a\r\ncelui d'Europe,\" but adds from Bartram's journal, that an American\r\nbear weighed four hundred pounds, English, equal to three\r\nhundred and sixty-seven pounds French; whereas we find the European\r\nbear examined by Mons. D'Aubenton, [XVII. 82,] weighed\r\nbut one hundred and forty-one pounds French. That the palmated\r\nelk is larger in America than in Europe, we are informed\r\nby Kalm,[10] a naturalist, who visited the former by public appointment,\r\nfor the express purpose of examining the subjects of natural\r\nhistory. In this fact Pennant concurs with him. [Barrington's\r\nMiscellanies.] The same Kalm tells us[11] that the black moose, or\r\nrenne of America, is as high as a tall horse; and Catesby,[12] that it is\r\nabout the bigness of a middle-sized ox. The same account of\r\ntheir size has been given me by many who have seen them.\r\nBut Monsieur D'Aubenton says[13] that the renne of Europe is\r\nabout the size of a red deer. The weasel is larger in America\r\nthan in Europe, as may be seen by comparing its dimensions as\r\nreported by Monsieur D'Aubenton[14] and Kalm. The latter tells\r\nus,[15] that the lynx, badger, red fox, and flying squirrel, are the\r\n_same_ in America as in Europe; by which expression I understand,\r\nthey are the same in all material circumstances, in size as\r\nwell as others; for if they were smaller, they would differ from\r\nthe European. Our gray fox is, by Catesby's account,[16] little\r\ndifferent in size and shape from the European fox. I presume\r\nhe means the red fox of Europe, as does Kalm, where he says,[17]\r\nthat in size \"they do not quite come up to our foxes.\" For\r\nproceeding next to the red fox of America, he says, \"they are\r\nentirely the same with the European sort;\" which shows he had\r\nin view one European sort only, which was the red. So that\r\nthe result of their testimony is, that the American gray fox is\r\nsomewhat less than the European red; which is equally true of\r\nthe gray fox of Europe, as may be seen by comparing the measures\r\nof the Count de Buffon and Monsieur D'Aubenton.[18] The\r\nwhite bear of America is as large as that of Europe. The bones\r\nof the mammoth which has been found in America, are as large\r\nas those found in the old world. It may be asked, why I insert\r\nthe mammoth, as if it still existed? I ask in return, why I should\r\nomit it, as if it did not exist? Such is the economy of nature,\r\nthat no instance can be produced, of her having permitted any\r\none race of her animals to become extinct; of her having formed\r\nany link in her great work so weak as to be broken. To add\r\nto this, the traditionary testimony of the Indians, that this animal\r\nstill exists in the northern and western parts of America, would\r\nbe adding the light of a taper to that of the meridian sun. Those\r\nparts still remain in their aboriginal state, unexplored and undisturbed\r\nby us, or by others for us. He may as well exist there\r\nnow, as he did formerly where we find his bones. If he be a\r\ncarnivorous animal, as some anatomists have conjectured, and\r\nthe Indians affirm, his early retirement may be accounted for\r\nfrom the general destruction of the wild game by the Indians,\r\nwhich commences in the first instant of their connection with\r\nus, for the purpose of purchasing match-coats, hatchets, and firelocks,\r\nwith their skins. There remain then the buffalo, red\r\ndeer, fallow deer, wolf, roe, glutton, wild cat, monax, bison,\r\nhedgehog, marten, and water-rat, of the comparative sizes of\r\nwhich we have not sufficient testimony. It does not appear\r\nthat Messieurs de Buffon and D'Aubenton have measured, weighed,\r\nor seen those of America. It is said of some of them, by some\r\ntravellers, that they are smaller than the European. But who\r\nwere these travellers? Have they not been men of a very different\r\ndescription from those who have laid open to us the other\r\nthree quarters of the world? Was natural history the object of\r\ntheir travels? Did they measure or weigh the animals they\r\nspeak of? or did they not judge of them by sight, or perhaps\r\neven from report only? Were they acquainted with the animals\r\nof their own country, with which they undertake to compare\r\nthem? Have they not been so ignorant as often to mistake the\r\nspecies? A true answer to these questions would probably lighten\r\ntheir authority, so as to render it insufficient for the foundation\r\nof an hypothesis. How unripe we yet are, for an accurate comparison\r\nof the animals of the two countries, will appear from the\r\nwork of Monsieur de Buffon. The ideas we should have formed\r\nof the sizes of some animals, from the information he had received\r\nat his first publications concerning them, are very different\r\nfrom what his subsequent communications give us. And indeed\r\nhis candor in this can never be too much praised. One sentence\r\nof his book must do him immortal honor. \"J'aime autant une\r\npersonne qui me releve d'une erreur, qu'une autre qui m'apprend\r\nune verité, parce qu'en effet une erreur corrigée est une verité.\"[19]\r\nHe seems to have thought the cabiai he first examined wanted\r\nlittle of its full growth. \"Il n'etoit pas encore tout-a-fait\r\nadulte.\"[20] Yet he weighed but forty-six and a half pounds, and\r\nhe found afterwards,[21] that these animals, when full grown, weigh\r\none hundred pounds. He had supposed, from the examination\r\nof a jaguar,[22] said to be two years old, which weighed but sixteen\r\npounds twelve ounces, that when he should have acquired\r\nhis full growth, he would not be larger than a middle-sized dog.\r\nBut a subsequent account[23] raises his weight to two hundred\r\npounds. Further information will, doubtless, produce further\r\ncorrections. The wonder is, not that there is yet something in\r\nthis great work to correct, but that there is so little. The result\r\nof this view then is, that of twenty-six quadrupeds common to\r\nboth countries, seven are said to be larger in America, seven of\r\nequal size, and twelve not sufficiently examined. So that the\r\nfirst table impeaches the first member of the assertion, that of\r\nthe animals common to both countries, the American are smallest,\r\n\"et cela sans aucune exception.\" It shows it is not just, in all the\r\nlatitude in which its author has advanced it, and probably not to\r\nsuch a degree as to found a distinction between the two countries.\r\n\r\nProceeding to the second table, which arranges the animals\r\nfound in one of the two countries only, Monsieur de Buffon observes,\r\nthat the tapir, the elephant of America, is but of the size\r\nof a small cow. To preserve our comparison, I will add, that\r\nthe wild boar, the elephant of Europe, is little more than half\r\nthat size. I have made an elk with round or cylindrical horns\r\nan animal of America, and peculiar to it; because I have seen\r\nmany of them myself, and more of their horns; and because I\r\ncan say, from the best information, that, in Virginia, this kind\r\nof elk has abounded much, and still exists in smaller numbers;\r\nand I could never learn that the palmated kind had been seen\r\nhere at all. I suppose this confined to the more northern latitudes.[24]\r\nI have made our hare or rabbit peculiar, believing it\r\nto be different from both the European animals of those denominations,\r\nand calling it therefore by its Algonquin name,\r\nWhabus, to keep it distinct from these. Kalm is of the same\r\nopinion.[25] I have enumerated the squirrels according to our own\r\nknowledge, derived from daily sight of them, because I am not\r\nable to reconcile with that the European appellations and descriptions.\r\nI have heard of other species, but they have never\r\ncome within my own notice. These, I think, are the only instances\r\nin which I have departed from the authority of Monsieur\r\nde Buffon in the construction of this table. I take him for my\r\nground work, because I think him the best informed of any\r\nnaturalist who has ever written. The result is, that there are\r\neighteen quadrupeds peculiar to Europe; more than four times\r\nas many, to wit, seventy four, peculiar to America; that the[26]\r\nfirst of these seventy-four weighs more than the whole column\r\nof Europeans; and consequently this second table disproves the\r\nsecond member of the assertion, that the animals peculiar to the\r\nnew world are on a smaller scale, so far as that assertion relied\r\non European animals for support; and it is in full opposition to\r\nthe theory which makes the animal volume to depend on the\r\ncircumstances of _heat_ and _moisture_.\r\n\r\nThe third table comprehends those quadrupeds only which\r\nare domestic in both countries. That some of these, in some\r\nparts of America, have become less than their original stock, is\r\ndoubtless true; and the reason is very obvious. In a thinly-peopled\r\ncountry, the spontaneous productions of the forests, and\r\nwaste fields, are sufficient to support indifferently the domestic\r\nanimals of the farmer, with a very little aid from him, in the severest\r\nand scarcest season. He therefore finds it more convenient\r\nto receive them from the hand of nature in that indifferent\r\nstate, than to keep up their size by a care and nourishment\r\nwhich would cost him much labor. If, on this low fare, these\r\nanimals dwindle, it is no more than they do in those parts of\r\nEurope where the poverty of the soil, or the poverty of the owner,\r\nreduces them to the same scanty subsistence. It is the uniform\r\neffect of one and the same cause, whether acting on this or that\r\nside of the globe. It would be erring, therefore, against this rule\r\nof philosophy, which teaches us to ascribe like effects to like\r\ncauses, should we impute this diminution of size in America to\r\nany imbecility or want of uniformity in the operations of nature.\r\nIt may be affirmed with truth, that, in those countries, and with\r\nthose individuals in America, where necessity or curiosity has\r\nproduced equal attention, as in Europe, to the nourishment of\r\nanimals, the horses, cattle, sheep, and hogs, of the one continent\r\nare as large as those of the other. There are particular instances,\r\nwell attested, where individuals of this country have imported\r\ngood breeders from England, and have improved their size by\r\ncare in the course of some years. To make a fair comparison\r\nbetween the two countries, it will not answer to bring together\r\nanimals of what might be deemed the middle or ordinary size of\r\nthen species; because an error in judging of that middle or ordinary\r\nsize, would vary the result of the comparison. Thus Mons.\r\nD'Aubenton[27] considers a horse of 4 feet five inches high and\r\n400 lb. weight French, equal to 4 feet 8.6 inches and 436 lb.\r\nEnglish, as a middle-sized horse. Such a one is deemed a small\r\nhorse in America. The extremes must therefore be resorted to.\r\nThe same anatomist[28] dissected a horse of 5 feet 9 inches height,\r\nFrench measure, equal to 6 feet 1.7 English. This is near 6\r\ninches higher than any horse I have seen; and could it be supposed\r\nthat I had seen the largest horses in America, the conclusion\r\nwould be, that ours have diminished, or that we have bred\r\nfrom a smaller stock. In Connecticut and Rhode Island, where\r\nthe climate is favorable to the production of grass, bullocks have\r\nbeen slaughtered which weighed 2,500, 2,200, and 2,100 lbs.\r\nnett; and those of 1,800 lbs. have been frequent. I have seen\r\na hog[29] weigh 1,050 lbs. after the blood, bowels, and hair had\r\nbeen taken from him. Before he was killed, an attempt was\r\nmade to weigh him with a pair of steel yards, graduated to\r\n1,200 lbs., but he weighed more. Yet this hog was probably\r\nnot within fifty generations of the European stock. I am well informed\r\nof another which weighed 1,100 lbs. gross. Asses have been\r\nstill more neglected than any other domestic animal in America.\r\nThey are neither fed or housed in the most rigorous season of\r\nthe year. Yet they are larger than those measured by Mons.\r\nD'Aubenton,[30] of 3 feet 7¼ inches, 3 feet 4 inches, and 3 feet\r\n2½ inches, the latter weighing only 215.8 lbs. These sizes, I\r\nsuppose, have been produced by the same negligence in Europe,\r\nwhich has produced a like diminution here. Where care\r\nhas been taken of them on that side of the water, they have\r\nbeen raised to a size bordering on that of the horse; not by the\r\n_heat_ and _dryness_ of the climate, but by good food and shelter.\r\nGoats have been also much neglected in America. Yet they are\r\nvery prolific here, bearing twice or three times a year, and from\r\none to five kids at a birth. Mons. de Buffon has been sensible\r\nof a difference in this circumstance in favor of America.[31] But\r\nwhat are their greatest weights, I cannot say. A large sheep\r\nhere weighs 100 lbs. I observe Mons. D'Aubenton calls a ram\r\nof 62 lbs. one of the middle size.[32] But to say what are the extremes\r\nof growth in these and the other domestic animals of\r\nAmerica, would require information of which no one individual\r\nis possessed. The weights actually known and stated in the\r\nthird table preceding will suffice to show, that we may conclude\r\non probable grounds, that, with equal food and care, the climate\r\nof America will preserve the races of domestic animals as large\r\nas the European stock from which they are derived; and, consequently,\r\nthat the third member of Mons. de Buffon's assertion\r\nthat the domestic animals are subject to degeneration from the\r\nclimate of America, is as probably wrong as the first and second\r\nwere certainly so.\r\n\r\nThat the last part of it is erroneous, which affirms that the\r\nspecies of American quadrupeds are comparatively few, is evident\r\nfrom the tables taken together. By these it appears that there\r\nare an hundred species aboriginal in America. Mons. de Buffon\r\nsupposes about double that number existing on the whole earth.[33]\r\nOf these Europe, Asia, and Africa, furnish suppose one hundred\r\nand twenty-six; that is, the twenty-six common to Europe and\r\nAmerica, and about one hundred which are not in America at\r\nall. The American species, then, are to those of the rest of the\r\nearth, as one hundred to one hundred and twenty-six, or four to\r\nfive. But the residue of the earth being double the extent of\r\nAmerica, the exact proportion would have been but as four to eight.\r\n\r\nHitherto I have considered this hypothesis as applied to brute\r\nanimals only, and not in its extension to the man of America,\r\nwhether aboriginal or transplanted. It is the opinion of Mons.\r\nde Buffon that the former furnishes no exception to it.[34]\r\n\r\n     \"Quoique le sauvage du nouveau monde soit à peu près de\r\n     même stature que l'homme de notre monde, cela ne suffit pas\r\n     pour qu'il puisse faire une exception au fait général du\r\n     rapetissement de la nature vivante dans tout ce continent; le\r\n     sauvage est foible et petit par les organes de la génération;\r\n     il n'a ni poil, ni barbe, and nulle ardeur pour sa femelle.\r\n     Quoique plus léger que l'Européen, parce qu'il a plus d'habitude\r\n     à courir, il est cependant beaucoup moins fort de corps; il\r\n     est aussi bien moins sensible, et cependant plus craintif et\r\n     plus lâche; il n'a nulle vivacité, nulle activité dans l'ame;\r\n     celle du corps est moins un exercise, un mouvement volontaire\r\n     qu'une nécessité d'action causée par le besoin; ôtez lui la faim\r\n     et la soif, vous détruirez en même tems le principe actif de\r\n     tous ses mouvemens; il demeurera stupidement en repos sur ses\r\n     jambes ou couché pendant des jours entiers. Il ne faut pas aller\r\n     chercher plus loin à cause de la vie dispersée des sauvages\r\n     et de leur éloignement pour la société; la plus précieuse\r\n     étincelle du feu de la nature leur a été refusée; ils manquent\r\n     d'ardeur pour leur femelle, et par consequent d'amour pour\r\n     leur semblables; ne connoissant pas l'attachment le plus vif,\r\n     le plus tendre de tous, leurs autres sentimens de ce genre,\r\n     sont froids et languissans; ils aiment foiblement leurs pères\r\n     et leurs enfans; la société la plus intime de toutes, celle\r\n     de la même famille, n'a donc chez eux que de foibles liens;\r\n     la société d'une famille à l'autre n'en a point de tout; dès\r\n     lors nulle réunion, nulle république, nulle état social. La\r\n     physique de l'amour fait chez eux le moral des mœurs; leur cœur\r\n     est glacé, leur societé et leur empire dur. Ils ne regardent\r\n     leurs femmes que comme des servantes de peine ou des bêtes de\r\n     somme qu'ils chargent, sans ménagement, du fardeau de leur\r\n     chasse, et qu'ils forcent, sans pitié, sans reconnoissance,\r\n     à des ouvrages qui souvent sont au dessus de leurs forces;\r\n     ils n'ont que peu d'enfans; ils en out peu de soin; tout se\r\n     ressent de leur premier defaut; ils sont indifférents parce\r\n     qu'ils sont peu puissants, et cette indifference pour le sexe\r\n     est la tache originelle qui flétrit la nature, qui l'empeche\r\n     de s'épanouir, et qui detruisant les germes de la vie, coupe\r\n     en même temps la racine de société. L'homme ne fait donc point\r\n     d'exception ici. La nature en lui refusant les puissances\r\n     de l'amour l'a plus maltraité et plus rapetissé qu'aucun des\r\n     animaux.\"\r\n\r\nAn afflicting picture, indeed, which for the honor of human\r\nnature, I am glad to believe has no original. Of the Indian of\r\nSouth America I know nothing; for I would not honor with the\r\nappellation of knowledge, what I derive from the fables published\r\nof them. These I believe to be just as true as the fables\r\nof Æsop. This belief is founded on what I have seen of man,\r\nwhite, red, and black, and what has been written of him by\r\nauthors, enlightened themselves, and writing among an enlightened\r\npeople. The Indian of North America being more within\r\nour reach, I can speak of him somewhat from my own knowledge,\r\nbut more from the information of others better acquainted\r\nwith him, and on whose truth and judgment I can rely. From\r\nthese sources I am able to say, in contradiction to this representation,\r\nthat he is neither more defective in ardor, nor more impotent\r\nwith his female, than the white reduced to the same diet\r\nand exercise; that he is brave, when an enterprise depends on\r\nbravery; education with him making the point of honor consist\r\nin the destruction of an enemy by stratagem, and in the preservation\r\nof his own person free from injury; or, perhaps, this is nature,\r\nwhile it is education which teaches us to[35] honor force more\r\nthan finesse; that he will defend himself against a host of enemies,\r\nalways choosing to be killed, rather than to surrender,[36]\r\nthough it be to the whites, who he knows will treat him well;\r\nthat in other situations, also, he meets death with more deliberation,\r\nand endures tortures with a firmness unknown almost to\r\nreligious enthusiasm with us; that he is affectionate to his children,\r\ncareful of them, and indulgent in the extreme; that his\r\naffections comprehend his other connections, weakening, as with\r\nus, from circle to circle, as they recede from the centre; that his\r\nfriendships are strong and faithful to the uttermost[37] extremity;\r\nthat his sensibility is keen, even the warriors weeping most bitterly\r\non the loss of their children, though in general they endeavor\r\nto appear superior to human events; that his vivacity and\r\nactivity of mind is equal to ours in the same situation; hence his\r\neagerness for hunting, and for games of chance. The women\r\nare submitted to unjust drudgery. This I believe is the case\r\nwith every barbarous people. With such, force is law. The\r\nstronger sex imposes on the weaker. It is civilization alone\r\nwhich replaces women in the enjoyment of their natural equality.\r\nThat first teaches us to subdue the selfish passions, and to respect\r\nthose rights in others which we value in ourselves. Were\r\nwe in equal barbarism, our females would be equal drudges.\r\nThe man with them is less strong than with us, but their women\r\nstronger than ours; and both for the same obvious reason; because\r\nour man and their woman is habituated to labor, and\r\nformed by it. With both races the sex which is indulged with\r\nease is the least athletic. An Indian man is small in the hand\r\nand wrist, for the same reason for which a sailor is large and\r\nstrong in the arms and shoulders, and a porter in the legs and\r\nthighs. They raise fewer children than we do. The causes of\r\nthis are to be found, not in a difference of nature, but of circumstance.\r\nThe women very frequently attending the men in their\r\nparties of war and of hunting, child-bearing becomes extremely\r\ninconvenient to them. It is said, therefore, that they have\r\nlearned the practice of procuring abortion by the use of some\r\nvegetable; and that it even extends to prevent conception for a\r\nconsiderable time after. During these parties they are exposed\r\nto numerous hazards, to excessive exertions, to the greatest extremities\r\nof hunger. Even at their homes the nation depends\r\nfor food, through a certain part of every year, on the gleanings\r\nof the forest; that is, they experience a famine once in every\r\nyear. With all animals, if the female be badly fed, or not fed at\r\nall, her young perish; and if both male and female be reduced to\r\nlike want, generation becomes less active, less productive. To\r\nthe obstacles, then, of want and hazard, which nature has opposed\r\nto the multiplication of wild animals, for the purpose of\r\nrestraining their numbers within certain bounds, those of labor\r\nand of voluntary abortion are added with the Indian. No wonder,\r\nthen, if they multiply less than we do. Where food is\r\nregularly supplied, a single farm will show more of cattle, than\r\na whole country of forests can of buffaloes. The same Indian\r\nwomen, when married to white traders, who feed them and their\r\nchildren plentifully and regularly, who exempt them from excessive\r\ndrudgery, who keep them stationary and unexposed to accident,\r\nproduce and raise as many children as the white women.\r\nInstances are known, under these circumstances, of their rearing\r\na dozen children. An inhuman practice once prevailed in this\r\ncountry, of making slaves of the Indians. It is a fact well\r\nknown with us, that the Indian women so enslaved produced\r\nand raised as numerous families as either the whites or blacks\r\namong whom they lived. It has been said that Indians have\r\nless hair than the whites, except on the head. But this is a fact\r\nof which fair proof can scarcely be had. With them it is disgraceful\r\nto be hairy on the body. They say it likens them to\r\nhogs. They therefore pluck the hair as fast as it appears. But\r\nthe traders who marry their women, and prevail on them to discontinue\r\nthis practice, say, that nature is the same with them as\r\nwith the whites. Nor, if the fact be true, is the consequence\r\nnecessary which has been drawn from it. Negroes have notoriously\r\nless hair than the whites; yet they are more ardent. But\r\nif cold and moisture be the agents of nature for diminishing the\r\nraces of animals, how comes she all at once to suspend their\r\noperation as to the physical man of the new world, whom the\r\nCount acknowledges to be \"à peu près de même stature que\r\nl'homme de notre monde,\" and to let loose their influence on his\r\nmoral faculties? How has this \"combination of the elements\r\nand other physical causes, so contrary to the enlargement of\r\nanimal nature in this new world, these obstacles to the development\r\nand formation of great germs,\"[38] been arrested and suspended,\r\nso as to permit the human body to acquire its just dimensions,\r\nand by what inconceivable process has their action\r\nbeen directed on his mind alone? To judge of the truth of this,\r\nto form a just estimate of their genius and mental powers, more\r\nfacts are wanting, and great allowance to be made for those circumstances\r\nof their situation which call for a display of particular\r\ntalents only. This done, we shall probably find that they\r\nare formed in mind as well as in body, on the same module with\r\nthe[39] \"Homo sapiens Europæus.\" The principles of their society\r\nforbidding all compulsion, they are to be led to duty and\r\nto enterprise by personal influence and persuasion. Hence eloquence\r\nin council, bravery and address in war, become the\r\nfoundations of all consequence with them. To these acquirements\r\nall their faculties are directed. Of their bravery and address\r\nin war we have multiplied proofs, because we have been\r\nthe subjects on which they were exercised. Of their eminence\r\nin oratory we have fewer examples, because it is displayed\r\nchiefly in their own councils. Some, however, we have, of very\r\nsuperior lustre. I may challenge the whole orations of Demosthenes\r\nand Cicero, and of any more eminent orator, if Europe\r\nhas furnished more eminent, to produce a single passage, superior\r\nto the speech of Logan, a Mingo chief, to Lord Dunmore, then\r\ngovernor of this State. And as a testimony of their talents in\r\nthis line, I beg leave to introduce it, first stating the incidents\r\nnecessary for understanding it.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year 1774, a robbery was committed by\r\nsome Indians on certain land-adventurers on the river Ohio. The\r\nwhites in that quarter, according to their custom, undertook to\r\npunish this outrage in a summary way. Captain Michael Cresap,\r\nand a certain Daniel Greathouse, leading on these parties, surprised,\r\nat different times, travelling and hunting parties of the Indians,\r\nhaving their women and children with them, and murdered\r\nmany. Among these were unfortunately the family of Logan,\r\na chief celebrated in peace and war, and long distinguished as\r\nthe friend of the whites. This unworthy return provoked his\r\nvengeance. He accordingly signalized himself in the war which\r\nensued. In the autumn of the same year a decisive battle was\r\nfought at the mouth of the Great Kanhaway, between the collected\r\nforces of the Shawanese, Mingoes and Delawares, and a\r\ndetachment of the Virginia militia. The Indians were defeated\r\nand sued for peace. Logan, however, disdained to be seen\r\namong the suppliants. But lest the sincerity of a treaty should\r\nbe disturbed, from which so distinguished a chief absented himself,\r\nhe sent, by a messenger, the following speech, to be delivered\r\nto Lord Dunmore.\r\n\r\n\"I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he entered Logan's\r\ncabin hungry, and he gave him not meat; if ever he came cold\r\nand naked, and he clothed him not. During the course of the\r\nlast long and bloody war Logan remained idle in his cabin, an\r\nadvocate for peace. Such was my love for the whites, that my\r\ncountrymen pointed as they passed, and said, \"Logan is the\r\nfriend of white men.\" I had even thought to have lived with\r\nyou, but for the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap, the last\r\nspring, in cold blood, and unprovoked, murdered all the relations\r\nof Logan, not even sparing my women and children. There\r\nruns not a drop of my blood in the veins of any living creature.\r\nThis called on me for revenge. I have sought it: I have killed\r\nmany: I have fully glutted my vengeance: for my country I rejoice\r\nat the beams of peace. But do not harbor a thought that\r\nmine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear. He will not\r\nturn on his heel to save his life. Who is there to mourn for\r\nLogan?--Not one.\"[40]\r\n\r\nBefore we condemn the Indians of this continent as wanting\r\ngenius, we must consider that letters have not yet been introduced\r\namong them. Were we to compare them in their present state\r\nwith the Europeans, north of the Alps, when the Roman arms\r\nand arts first crossed those mountains, the comparison would be\r\nunequal, because, at that time, those parts of Europe were swarming\r\nwith numbers; because numbers produce emulation, and\r\nmultiply the chances of improvement, and one improvement begets\r\nanother. Yet I may safely ask, how many good poets, how\r\nmany able mathematicians, how many great inventors in arts or\r\nsciences, had Europe, north of the Alps, then produced? And\r\nit was sixteen centuries after this before a Newton could be\r\nformed. I do not mean to deny that there are varieties in the\r\nrace of man, distinguished by their powers both of body and\r\nmind. I believe there are, as I see to be the case in the races\r\nof other animals. I only mean to suggest a doubt, whether the\r\nbulk and faculties of animals depend on the side of the Atlantic\r\non which their food happens to grow, or which furnishes the elements\r\nof which they are compounded? Whether nature has\r\nenlisted herself as a Cis- or Trans-Atlantic partisan? I am induced\r\nto suspect there has been more eloquence than sound\r\nreasoning displayed in support of this theory; that it is one of\r\nthose cases where the judgment has been seduced by a glowing\r\npen; and whilst I render every tribute of honor and esteem to\r\nthe celebrated zoologist, who has added, and is still adding, so\r\nmany precious things to the treasures of science, I must doubt\r\nwhether in this instance he has not cherished error also, by lending\r\nher for a moment his vivid imagination and bewitching language. (4.)\r\n\r\nSo far the Count de Buffon has carried this new theory of the\r\ntendency of nature to belittle her productions on this side the\r\nAtlantic. Its application to the race of whites transplanted from\r\nEurope, remained for the Abbé Raynal. \"On doit etre etonné\r\n(he says) que l'Amerique n'ait pas encore produit un bon poëte,\r\nun habile mathematicien, un homme de genie dans un seul art,\r\nou seule science.\" Hist. Philos. p. 92, ed. Maestricht, 1774.\r\n\"America has not yet produced one good poet.\" When we shall\r\nhave existed as a people as long as the Greeks did before they\r\nproduced a Homer, the Romans a Virgil, the French a Racine\r\nand Voltaire, the English a Shakespeare and Milton, should this\r\nreproach be still true, we will inquire from what unfriendly\r\ncauses it has proceeded, that the other countries of Europe and\r\nquarters of the earth shall not have inscribed any name in the\r\nroll of poets.[41] But neither has America produced \"one able\r\nmathematician, one man of genius in a single art or a single\r\nscience.\" In war we have produced a Washington, whose\r\nmemory will be adored while liberty shall have votaries, whose\r\nname shall triumph over time, and will in future ages assume its\r\njust station among the most celebrated worthies of the world,\r\nwhen that wretched philosophy shall be forgotten which would\r\nhave arranged him among the degeneracies of nature. In\r\nphysics we have produced a Franklin, than whom no one of the\r\npresent age has made more important discoveries, nor has enriched\r\nphilosophy with more, or more ingenious solutions of the\r\nphenomena of nature. We have supposed Mr. Rittenhouse\r\nsecond to no astronomer living; that in genius he must be the\r\nfirst, because he is self-taught. As an artist he has exhibited as\r\ngreat a proof of mechanical genius as the world has ever produced.\r\nHe has not indeed made a world; but he has by imitation\r\napproached nearer its Maker than any man who has lived\r\nfrom the creation to this day.[42] As in philosophy and war, so in\r\ngovernment, in oratory, in painting, in the plastic art, we might\r\nshow that America, though but a child of yesterday, has already\r\ngiven hopeful proofs of genius, as well as of the nobler kinds,\r\nwhich arouse the best feelings of man, which call him into action,\r\nwhich substantiate his freedom, and conduct him to happiness,\r\nas of the subordinate, which serve to amuse him only. We\r\ntherefore suppose, that this reproach is as unjust as it is unkind:\r\nand that, of the geniuses which adorn the present age, America\r\ncontributes its full share. For comparing it with those countries\r\nwhere genius is most cultivated, where are the most excellent\r\nmodels for art, and scaffoldings for the attainment of science, as\r\nFrance and England for instance, we calculate thus: The United\r\nStates contains three millions of inhabitants; France twenty\r\nmillions; and the British islands ten. We produce a Washington,\r\na Franklin, a Rittenhouse. France then should have half\r\na dozen in each of these lines, and Great Britain half that number,\r\nequally eminent. It may be true that France has; we are\r\nbut just becoming acquainted with her, and our acquaintance so\r\nfar gives us high ideas of the genius of her inhabitants. It\r\nwould be injuring too many of them to name particularly a Voltaire,\r\na Buffon, the constellation of Encyclopedists, the Abbé\r\nRaynal himself, &c. &c. We, therefore, have reason to believe\r\nshe can produce her full quota of genius. The present war having\r\nso long cut off all communication with Great Britain, we are\r\nnot able to make a fair estimate of the state of science in that\r\ncountry. The spirit in which she wages war, is the only sample\r\nbefore our eyes, and that does not seem the legitimate offspring\r\neither of science or of civilization. The sun of her\r\nglory is fast descending to the horizon. Her philosophy has\r\ncrossed the channel, her freedom the Atlantic, and herself seems\r\npassing to that awful dissolution whose issue is not given human\r\nforesight to scan.[43]\r\n\r\nHaving given a sketch of our minerals, vegetables, and quadrupeds,\r\nand being led by a proud theory to make a comparison\r\nof the latter with those of Europe, and to extend it to the man\r\nof America, both aboriginal and emigrant, I will proceed to the\r\nremaining articles comprehended under the present query.\r\n\r\nBetween ninety and a hundred of our birds have been described\r\nby Catesby.

The circumstances in which all the individuals\r\nagree are these. They are of a pallid cadaverous white, untinged\r\nwith red, without any colored spots or seams; their hair\r\nof the same kind of white, short, coarse, and curled as is that of\r\nthe negro; all of them well formed, strong, healthy, perfect in\r\ntheir senses, except that of sight, and born of parents who had\r\nno mixture of white blood. Three of these Albinos were sisters,\r\nhaving two other full sisters, who were black. The youngest\r\nof the three was killed by lightning, at twelve years of age.\r\nThe eldest died at about 27 years of age, in child-bed, with her\r\nsecond child. The middle one is now alive, in health, and has\r\nissue, as the eldest had, by a black man, which issue was black.\r\nThey are uncommonly shrewd, quick in their apprehensions and\r\nin reply. Their eyes are in a perpetual tremulous vibration,\r\nvery weak, and much affected by the sun; but they see much\r\nbetter in the night than we do. They are of the property of\r\nColonel Skipwith, of Cumberland. The fourth is a negro\r\nwoman, whose parents came from Guinea, and had three other\r\nchildren, who were of their own color. She is freckled, her\r\neye-sight so weak that she is obliged to wear a bonnet in the\r\nsummer; but it is better in the night than day. She had an\r\nAlbino child by a black man. It died at the age of a few weeks.\r\nThese were the property of Col. Carter, of Albemarle. A sixth\r\ninstance is a women the property of a Mr. Butler, near Petersburg.\r\nShe is stout and robust, has issue a daughter, jet black,\r\nby a black man. I am not informed as to her eye-sight. The\r\nseventh instance is of a male belonging to a Mr. Lee of Cumberland.\r\nHis eyes are tremulous and weak. He is tall of stature,\r\nand now advanced in years. He is the only male of the Albinos\r\nwhich have come within my information. Whatever be the\r\ncause of the disease in the skin, or in its coloring matter, which\r\nproduces this change, it seems more incident to the female than\r\nmale sex. To these I may add the mention of a negro man\r\nwithin my own knowledge, born black, and of black parents;\r\non whose chin, when a boy, a white spot appeared. This continued\r\nto increase till he became a man, by which time it had\r\nextended over his chin, lips, one cheek, the under jaw, and neck\r\non that side. It is of the Albino white, without any mixture of\r\nred, and has for several years been stationary. He is robust and\r\nhealthy, and the change of color was not accompanied with any\r\nsensible disease, either general or topical.\r\n\r\nOf our fish and insects there has been nothing like a full description\r\nor collection. More of them are described in Catesby\r\nthan in any other work. Many also are to be found in Sir Hans\r\nSloane's Jamaica, as being common to that and this country.\r\nThe honey-bee is not a native of our continent. Marcgrave, indeed,\r\nmentions a species of honey-bee in Brazil. But this has\r\nno sting, and is therefore different from the one we have, which\r\nresembles perfectly that of Europe. The Indians concur with\r\nus in the tradition that it was brought from Europe; but when,\r\nand by whom, we know not. The bees have generally extended\r\nthemselves into the country, a little in advance of the\r\nwhite settlers. The Indians, therefore, call them the white\r\nman's fly, and consider their approach as indicating the approach\r\nof the settlements of the whites. A question here occurs, How\r\nfar northwardly have these insects been found? That they are\r\nunknown in Lapland, I infer from Scheffer's information, that\r\nthe Laplanders eat the pine bark, prepared in a certain way, instead\r\nof those things sweetened with sugar. \"Hoc comedunt\r\npro rebus saccharo conditis.\" Scheff. Lapp. c. 18. Certainly if\r\nthey had honey, it would be a better substitute for sugar than\r\nany preparation of the pine bark. Kalm tells us[44] the honey-bee\r\ncannot live through the winter in Canada. They furnish then\r\nan additional fact first observed by the Count de Buffon, and\r\nwhich has thrown such a blaze of light on the field of natural\r\nhistory, that no animals are found in both continents, but those\r\nwhich are able to bear the cold of those regions where they probably\r\njoin.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [3] 2 Buffon Epoques, 96.\r\n\r\n    [4] Hunter.\r\n\r\n    [5] D'Aubenton.\r\n\r\n    [6] Buffon, xviii. 112 edit.

And in fact, travellers tell us that these\r\n        islands are places of principal resort for them, and\r\n        especially in the season of bringing forth their young.\r\n\r\n    [10] I. 233, Lon. 1772.\r\n\r\n    [11] Ib. 233.\r\n\r\n    [12] l. xxvii.\r\n\r\n    [13] XXIV. 162.\r\n\r\n    [14] XV. 42.\r\n\r\n    [15] I. 359.

It has not however extended\r\n         to our latitudes. On the other hand, I could never learn\r\n         that the round-horned elk has been seen further north\r\n         than the Hudson's river. This agrees with the former elk\r\n         in its general character, being, like that, when compared\r\n         with a deer, very much larger, its ears longer, broader,\r\n         and thicker in proportion, its hair much longer, neck and\r\n         tail shorter, having a dewlap before the breast (caruncula\r\n         gutturalis Linnæi) a white spot often, if not always, of\r\n         a foot diameter, on the hinder part of the buttocks round\r\n         the tail; its gait a trot, and attended with a rattling\r\n         of the hoofs; but distinguished from that decisively by\r\n         its horns, which are not palmated, but round and pointed.\r\n         This is the animal described by Catesby as the Cervus major\r\n         Americanus, the stag of America, le Cerf de l'Amerique. But\r\n         it differs from the Cervus as totally as does the palmated\r\n         elk from the dama. And in fact it seems to stand in the\r\n         same relation to the palmated elk, as the red deer does\r\n         to the fallow. It has abounded in Virginia, has been seen,\r\n         within my knowledge, on the eastern side of the Blue Ridge\r\n         since the year 1765, is now common beyond those mountains,\r\n         has been often brought to us and tamed, and its horns are\r\n         in the hands of many. I should designate it as the \"Alces\r\n         Americanus cornibus teretibus.\" It were to be wished, that\r\n         naturalists, who are acquainted with the renne and elk of\r\n         Europe, and who may hereafter visit the northern parts\r\n         of America, would examine well the animals called there\r\n         by the names of gray and black moose, caribou, original\r\n         and elk. Monsieur de Buffon has done what could be done\r\n         from the materials in his hands, toward clearing up the\r\n         confusion introduced by the loose application of these names\r\n         among the animals they are meant to designate. He reduces\r\n         the whole to the renne and flat-horned elk. From all the\r\n         information I have been able to collect, I strongly suspect\r\n         they will be found to cover three, if not four distinct\r\n         species of animals. I have seen skins of a moose, and of\r\n         the caribou: they differ more from each other, and from\r\n         that of the round-horned elk, than I ever saw two skins\r\n         differ which belonged to different individuals of any wild\r\n         species. These differences are in the color, length, and\r\n         coarseness of the hair, and in the size, texture, and marks\r\n         of the skin. Perhaps it will be found that there is, 1,\r\n         the moose, black and gray, the former being said to be the\r\n         male, and the latter the female; 2, the caribou or renne;\r\n         3, the flat-horned elk, or original; 4, the round-horned\r\n         elk. Should this last, though possessing so nearly the\r\n         characters of the elk, be found to be the same with the\r\n         Cerf d'Ardennes or Brandhitz of Germany, still there will\r\n         remain the three species first enumerated.\r\n\r\n    [25] Kalm II. 340, I. 82.\r\n\r\n    [26] The Tapir is the largest of the animals peculiar to America.\r\n         I collect his weight thus: Monsieur de Buffon says, XXIII.\r\n         274, that he is of the size of a Zebu, or a small cow.\r\n         He gives us the measures of a Zebu, ib. 4, as taken by\r\n         himself, viz. five feet seven inches from the muzzle to\r\n         the root of the tail, and five feet one inch circumference\r\n         behind the fore-legs. A bull, measuring in the same way\r\n         six feet nine inches and five feet two inches, weighed six\r\n         hundred pounds, VIII. 153. The Zebu then, and of course\r\n         the Tapir, would weigh about five hundred pounds. But one\r\n         individual of every species of European peculiars would\r\n         probably weigh less than four hundred pounds. These are\r\n         French measures and weights.\r\n\r\n    [27] VII. 432.\r\n\r\n    [28] VII. 474.\r\n\r\n    [29] In Williamsburg, April, 1769.\r\n\r\n    [30] VIII. 48, 55, 66.\r\n\r\n    [31] XVIII. 96.\r\n\r\n    [32] IX. 41.\r\n\r\n    [33] XXX. 219.\r\n\r\n    [34] XVIII. 146.\r\n\r\n    [35] Sol Rodomonte sprezza di venire\r\n         Se non, dove la via meno o fieura.--ARISTO, 14, 117.\r\n\r\n\r\n    [36] In so judicious an author as Don Ulloa, and one to whom we\r\n         are indebted for the most precise information we have of\r\n         South America, I did not expect to find such assertions as\r\n         the following: \"Los Indios vencidos son los mas cobardes\r\n         y pusilanimes que se pueden vér: Se hacen inöcentes, le\r\n         humillan hasta el desprecio, disculpan su inconsiderado\r\n         arrojo, y con las suplicas y los ruegos dán seguras pruebas\r\n         de su pusilanimidad. Ó lo que resieren las historias de\r\n         la Conquista, sobre sus grandes acciones, es en un sendito\r\n         figurado, ó el caracter de estas gentes no es ahora segun\r\n         era entonces; pero lo que no tiene duda es, que las Naciones\r\n         de la parte Septentrional subsisten en la misma libertad\r\n         que siempre han tenido, sin haber sido sojuzgados por algon\r\n         Principe extrano, y que viven segun su régimen y costumbres\r\n         de toda la vida, sin que haya habido motivo para que muden\r\n         de caracter; y en estos se vé lo mismo, que sucede en los\r\n         Peru, y de toda la América Meridional, reducidos, y que\r\n         nunca lo han estado.\" Noticias Americanas, Entretenimiento\r\n         xviii. §. 1. Don Ulloa here admits, that the authors who\r\n         have described the Indians of South America, before they\r\n         were enslaved, had represented them as a brave people,\r\n         and therefore seems to have suspected that the cowardice\r\n         which he had observed in those of the present race might\r\n         be the effect of subjugation. But, supposing the Indians\r\n         of North America to be cowards also, he concludes the\r\n         ancestors of those of South America to have been so too,\r\n         and, therefore, that those authors have given fictions\r\n         for truth. He was probably not acquainted himself with\r\n         the Indians of North America, and had formed his opinion\r\n         from hear-say. Great numbers of French, of English, and\r\n         of Americans, are perfectly acquainted with these people.\r\n         Had he had an opportunity of inquiring of any of these,\r\n         they would have told him, that there never was an instance\r\n         known of an Indian begging his life when in the power\r\n         of his enemies; on the contrary, that he courts death\r\n         by every possible insult and provocation. His reasoning,\r\n         then, would have been reversed thus: \"Since the present\r\n         Indian of North America is brave, and authors tell us that\r\n         the ancestors of those of South America were brave also,\r\n         it must follow that the cowardice of their descendants\r\n         is the effect of subjugation and ill treatment.\" For he\r\n         observes, ib. §. 27, that \"los obrages los aniquillan por\r\n         la inhumanidad con que se les trata.\"\r\n\r\n    [37] XVIII. 146.\r\n\r\n    [38] Linn. Syst. Definition of a Man.\r\n\r\n    [39] A remarkable instance of this appeared in the case of the\r\n         late Colonel Byrd, who was sent to the Cherokee nation to\r\n         transact some business with them. It happened that some of\r\n         our disorderly people had just killed one or two of that\r\n         nation. It was therefore proposed in the council of the\r\n         Cherokees that Colonel Byrd should be put to death, in\r\n         revenge for the loss of their countrymen. Among them was\r\n         a chief named Silòuee, who, on some former occasion, had\r\n         contracted an acquaintance and friendship with Colonel Byrd.\r\n         He came to him every night in his tent, and told him not\r\n         to be afraid, they should not kill him. After many days'\r\n         deliberation, however, the determination was, contrary to\r\n         Silòuee's expectation, that Byrd should be put to death,\r\n         and some warriors were despatched as executioners. Silòuee\r\n         attended them, and when they entered the tent, he threw\r\n         himself between them and Byrd, and said to the warriors,\r\n         \"This man is my friend; before you get at him, you must\r\n         kill me.\" On which they returned, and the council respected\r\n         the principle so much as to recede from their determination.\r\n\r\n  [40]                               PHILADELPHIA, December 31, 1797.\r\n\r\n         DEAR SIR,--Mr. Tazewell has communicated to me the inquiries\r\n         you have been so kind as to make, relative to a passage\r\n         in the \"Notes on Virginia,\" which has lately excited some\r\n         newspaper publications. I feel, with great sensibility,\r\n         the interest you take in this business, and with pleasure,\r\n         go into explanations with one whose objects I know to be\r\n         truth and justice alone. Had Mr. Martin thought proper\r\n         to suggest to me, that doubts might be entertained of the\r\n         transaction respecting Logan, as stated in the \"Notes on\r\n         Virginia,\" and to inquire on what grounds that statement\r\n         was founded, I should have felt myself obliged by the\r\n         inquiry; have informed him candidly of the grounds, and\r\n         cordially have co-operated in every means of investigating\r\n         the fact, and correcting whatsoever in it should be found\r\n         to have been erroneous. But he chose to step at once into\r\n         the newspapers, and in his publications there and the\r\n         letters he wrote to me, adopted a style which forbade the\r\n         respect of an answer. Sensible, however, that no act of\r\n         his could absolve me from the justice due to others, as\r\n         soon as I found that the story of Logan could be doubted,\r\n         I determined to inquire into it as accurately as the\r\n         testimony remaining, after a lapse of twenty odd years,\r\n         would permit, and that the result should be made known,\r\n         either in the first new edition which should be printed of\r\n         the \"Notes on Virginia,\" or by publishing an appendix. I\r\n         thought that so far as that work had contributed to impeach\r\n         the memory of Cresap, by handing on an erroneous charge it\r\n         was proper it should be made the vehicle of retribution.\r\n         Not that I was at all the author of the injury; I had\r\n         only concurred, with thousands and thousands of others,\r\n         in believing a transaction on authority which merited\r\n         respect. For the story of Logan is only repeated in the\r\n         \"Notes on Virginia,\" precisely as it had been current for\r\n         more than a dozen years before they were published. When\r\n         Lord Dunmore returned from the expedition against the\r\n         Indians, in 1774, he and his officers brought the speech\r\n         of Logan, and related the circumstances of it. These were\r\n         so affecting, and the speech itself so fine a morsel of\r\n         eloquence, that it became the theme of every conversation,\r\n         in Williamsburg particularly, and generally, indeed,\r\n         wheresoever any of the officers resided or resorted. I\r\n         learned it in Williamsburg, I believe at Lord Dunmore's;\r\n         and I find in my pocket-book of that year (1774) an entry\r\n         of the narrative, as taken from the mouth of some person,\r\n         whose name, however, is not noted, nor recollected,\r\n         precisely in the words stated in the \"Notes on Virginia.\"\r\n         The speech was published in the Virginia Gazette of that\r\n         time, (I have it myself in the volume of gazettes of that\r\n         year,) and though it was the translation made by the common\r\n         interpreter, and in a style by no means elegant, yet it\r\n         was so admired, that it flew through all the public papers\r\n         of the continent, and through the magazines and other\r\n         periodical publications of Great Britain; and those who\r\n         were boys at that day will now attest, that the speech\r\n         of Logan used to be given them as a school exercise for\r\n         repetition. It was not till about thirteen or fourteen\r\n         years after the newspaper publications, that the \"Notes on\r\n         Virginia\" were published in America. Combating, in these,\r\n         the contumelious theory of certain European writers, whose\r\n         celebrity gave currency and weight to their opinions, that\r\n         our country from the combined effects of soil and climate,\r\n         degenerated animal nature, in the general, and particularly\r\n         the moral faculties of man, I considered the speech of\r\n         Logan as an apt proof of the contrary, and used it as\r\n         such; and I copied, verbatim, the narrative I had taken\r\n         down in 1774, and the speech as it had been given us in a\r\n         better translation by Lord Dunmore. I knew nothing of the\r\n         Cresaps, and could not possibly have a motive to do them\r\n         an injury with design. I repeated what thousands had done\r\n         before, on as good authority as we have for most of the\r\n         facts we learn through life, and such as, to this moment,\r\n         I have seen no reason to doubt. That any body questioned\r\n         it, was never suspected by me, till I saw the letter of\r\n         Mr. Martin in the Baltimore paper. I endeavored then to\r\n         recollect who among my contemporaries, of the same circle\r\n         of society, and consequently of the same recollections,\r\n         might still be alive; three and twenty years of death\r\n         and dispersion had left very few. I remembered, however,\r\n         that General Gibson was still living, and knew that he\r\n         had been the translator of the speech. I wrote to him\r\n         immediately. He, in answer, declares to me, that he was\r\n         the very person sent by Lord Dunmore to the Indian town;\r\n         that, after he had delivered his message there, Logan\r\n         took him out to a neighboring wood; sat down with him, and\r\n         rehearsing, with tears, the catastrophe of his family, gave\r\n         him that speech for Lord Dunmore; that he carried it to\r\n         Lord Dunmore; translated it for him; has turned to it in\r\n         the Encyclopedia, as taken from the \"Notes on Virginia,\"\r\n         and finds that it was his translation I had used, with\r\n         only two or three verbal variations of no importance.\r\n         These, I suppose, had arisen in the course of successive\r\n         copies. I cite General Gibson's letter by memory, not\r\n         having it with me; but I am sure I cite it substantially\r\n         right. It establishes unquestionably, that the speech of\r\n         Logan is genuine; and that being established, it is Logan\r\n         himself who is author of all the important facts. \"Colonel\r\n         Cresap,\" says he, \"in cold blood and unprovoked, murdered\r\n         all the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women\r\n         and children; there runs not a drop of my blood in the\r\n         veins of any living creature.\" The person and the fact,\r\n         in all its material circumstances, are here given by Logan\r\n         himself. General Gibson, indeed, says, that the title was\r\n         mistaken; that Cresap was a Captain, and not a Colonel.\r\n         This was Logan's mistake. He also observes, that it was on\r\n         another water of the Ohio, and not on the Kanhaway, that\r\n         his family was killed. This is an error which has crept\r\n         into the traditionary account; but surely of little moment\r\n         in the moral view of the subject. The material question\r\n         is, was Logan's family murdered, and by whom? That it\r\n         was murdered has not, I believe, been denied; that it was\r\n         by one of the Cresaps, Logan affirms. This is a question\r\n         which concerns the memories of Logan and Cresap; to the\r\n         issue of which I am as indifferent as if I had never heard\r\n         the name of either. I have begun and shall continue to\r\n         inquire into the evidence additional to Logan's, on which\r\n         the fact was founded. Little, indeed, can now be heard\r\n         of, and that little dispersed and distant. If it shall\r\n         appear on inquiry, that Logan has been wrong in charging\r\n         Cresap with the murder of his family, I will do justice\r\n         to the memory of Cresap, as far as I have contributed to\r\n         the injury, by believing and repeating what others had\r\n         believed and repeated before me. If, on the other hand, I\r\n         find that Logan was right in his charge, I will vindicate,\r\n         as far as my suffrage may go, the truth of a Chief, whose\r\n         talents and misfortunes have attached to him the respect\r\n         and commiseration of the world.\r\n\r\n         I have gone, my dear Sir, into this lengthy detail to\r\n         satisfy a mind, in the candor and rectitude of which I have\r\n         the highest confidence. So far as you may incline to use\r\n         the communication for rectifying the judgments of those\r\n         who are willing to see things truly as they are, you are\r\n         free to use it. But I pray that no confidence which you may\r\n         repose in any one, may induce you to let it go out of your\r\n         hands, so as to get into a newspaper: against a contest\r\n         in that field I am entirely decided. I feel extraordinary\r\n         gratification, indeed, in addressing this letter to you,\r\n         with whom shades of difference in political sentiment have\r\n         not prevented the interchange of good opinion, nor cut off\r\n         the friendly offices of society and good correspondence.\r\n         This political tolerance is the more valued by me, who\r\n         consider social harmony as the first of human felicities,\r\n         and the happiest moments, those which are given to the\r\n         effusions of the heart. Accept them sincerely, I pray you,\r\n         from one who has the honor to be, with sentiments of high\r\n         respect and attachment, dear Sir, your most obedient, and\r\n         most humble servant.\r\n\r\n    [41] Has the world as yet produced more than two poets,\r\n         acknowledged to be such by all nations? An Englishman only\r\n         reads Milton with delight, an Italian, Tasso, a Frenchman,\r\n         the Henriade; a Portuguese, Camoens; but Homer and Virgil\r\n         have been the rapture of every age and nation; they are\r\n         read with enthusiasm in their originals by those who can\r\n         read the originals, and in translations by those who cannot.\r\n\r\n    [42] There are various ways of keeping truth out of sight. Mr.\r\n         Rittenhouse's model of the planetary system has the plagiary\r\n         application of an Orrery; and the quadrant invented by\r\n         Godfrey, an American also, and with the aid of which the\r\n         European nations traverse the globe, is called Hadley's\r\n         quadrant.\r\n\r\n    [43] In a later edition of the Abbé Raynal's work, he has\r\n         withdrawn his censure from that part of the new world\r\n         inhabited by the Federo-Americans; but has left it still\r\n         on the other parts. North America has always been more\r\n         accessible to strangers than South. If he was mistaken\r\n         then as to the former, he may be so as to the latter. The\r\n         glimmerings which reach us from South America enable us\r\n         to see that its inhabitants are held under the accumulated\r\n         pressure of slavery, superstition and ignorance. Whenever\r\n         they shall be able to rise under this weight, and to show\r\n         themselves to the rest of the world, they will probably\r\n         show they are like the rest of the world. We have not yet\r\n         sufficient evidence that there are more lakes and fogs in\r\n         South America than in other parts of the earth. As little\r\n         do we know what would be their operation on the mind\r\n         of man. That country has been visited by Spaniards and\r\n         Portuguese chiefly, and almost exclusively. These, going\r\n         from a country of the old world remarkably dry in its soil\r\n         and climate, fancied there were more lakes and fogs in\r\n         South America than in Europe. An inhabitant of Ireland,\r\n         Sweden, or Finland would have formed the contrary opinion.\r\n         Had South America then been discovered and settled by a\r\n         people from a fenny country, it would probably have been\r\n         represented as much drier than the old world. A patient\r\n         pursuit of facts, and cautious combination and comparison\r\n         of them, is the drudgery to which man is subjected by his\r\n         Maker, if he wishes to attain sure knowledge.\r\n\r\n    [44] I. 126.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY VII.\r\n\r\n_A notice of all that can increase the progress of Human\r\nKnowledge?_\r\n\r\nUnder the latitude of this query, I will presume it not improper\r\nnor unacceptable to furnish some data for estimating the\r\nclimate of Virginia. Journals of observations on the quantity\r\nof rain, and degree of heat, being lengthy, confused, and too\r\nminute to produce general and distinct ideas, I have taken five\r\nyears' observations, to wit, from 1772 to 1777, made in Williamsburg\r\nand its neighborhood, have reduced them to an average\r\nfor every month in the year, and stated those averages in the\r\nfollowing table, adding an analytical view of the winds during\r\nthe same period.\r\n\r\nThe rains of every month, (as of January, for instance,)\r\nthrough the whole period of years, were added separately, and\r\nan average drawn from them. The coolest and warmest point\r\nof the same day in each year of the period, were added separately,\r\nand an average of the greatest cold and greatest heat of\r\nthat day was formed. From the averages of every day in the\r\nmonth, a general average was formed. The point from which\r\nthe wind blew, was observed two or three times in every day.\r\nThese observations, in the month of January, for instance,\r\nthrough the whole period, amounted to three hundred and thirty-seven.\r\nAt seventy-three of these, the wind was from the north;\r\nforty-seven from the north-east, &c. So that it will be easy to\r\nsee in what proportion each wind usually prevails in each month;\r\nor, taking the whole year, the total of observations through the\r\nwhole period having been three thousand six hundred and ninety-eight,\r\nit will be observed that six hundred and eleven of them\r\nwere from the north, five hundred and fifty-eight from the\r\nnorth-east, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n  ------+-------+--------------+-----------------------------------------\r\n        |Fall   |Least and     |                 WINDS.\r\n        |of     |greatest      +---+----+---+----+---+----+---+----+-----\r\n        |rain,  |daily heat, by|\r\n        |etc.,  |Fahrenheit's  |   |    |   |    |   |    |   |    |\r\n        |in     |thermometer.  |N. |N.E.| E.|S.E.| S.|S.W.| W.|N.W.|Total.\r\n        |inches.|              |   |    |   |    |   |    |   |    |\r\n  ------+-------+--------------+---+----+---+----+---+----+---+----+------\r\n  Jan.  | 3.192 |  38½ to 44   | 73| 47 | 32| 10 | 11| 78 | 40| 46 |  337\r\n  Feb.  | 2.049 |  41  .. 47½  | 61| 52 | 24| 11 |  4| 63 | 30| 31 |  276\r\n  March | 3.95  |  48  .. 54½  | 49| 44 | 38| 28 | 14| 83 | 29| 33 |  318\r\n  April | 3.68  |  56  .. 62½  | 35| 44 | 54| 19 |  9| 58 | 18| 20 |  257\r\n  May   | 2.871 |  63  .. 70½  | 27| 36 | 62| 23 |  7| 74 | 32| 20 |  281\r\n  June  | 3.751 |  71½ .. 78¼  | 22| 34 | 43| 24 | 13| 81 | 25| 25 |  267\r\n  July  | 4.497 |  77  .. 82½  | 41| 44 | 75| 15 |  7| 95 | 32| 19 |  328\r\n  August| 9.153 |  76¼ .. 81   | 43| 52 | 40| 30 |  9|103 | 27| 30 |  334\r\n  Sept. | 4.761 |  69½ .. 74¼  | 70| 60 | 51| 18 | 10| 81 | 18| 37 |  345\r\n  Oct.  | 3.633 |  61¼ .. 66½  | 52| 77 | 64| 15 |  6| 56 | 23| 34 |  327\r\n  Nov.  | 2.617 |  47¾ .. 53½  | 74| 21 | 20| 14 |  9| 63 | 35| 58 |  294\r\n  Dec.  | 2.877 |  43  .. 48¾  | 64| 37 | 18| 16 | 10| 91 | 42| 56 |  334\r\n        +-------+--------------+---+----+---+----+---+----+---+----+-----\r\n  Total.|47.038 | 8 A.M.       |611|548 |521|223 |109|926 |351|409 |3,698\r\n        |       |  to 4 P.

Perhaps it will be found, there are twice as\r\nmany cloudy days in the middle parts of Europe, as in the\r\nUnited States of America. I mention the middle parts of Europe,\r\nbecause my information does not extend to its northern or\r\nsouthern parts.\r\n\r\nIn an extensive country, it will of course be expected that the\r\nclimate is not the same in all its parts. It is remarkable, that\r\nproceeding on the same parallel of latitude westwardly, the\r\nclimate becomes colder in like manner as when you proceed\r\nnorthwardly. This continues to be the case till you attain the\r\nsummit of the Alleghany, which is the highest land between the\r\nocean and the Mississippi. From thence, descending in the\r\nsame latitude to the Mississippi, the change reverses; and, if we\r\nmay believe travellers, it becomes warmer there than it is in the\r\nsame latitude on the sea-side. Their testimony is strengthened\r\nby the vegetables and animals which subsist and multiply there\r\nnaturally, and do not on the sea-coast. Thus Catalpas grow\r\nspontaneously on the Mississippi, as far as the latitude of 37°,\r\nand reeds as far as 38°. Parroquets even winter on the Scioto,\r\nin the 39th degree of latitude. In the summer of 1779, when\r\nthe thermometer was at 90° at Monticello, and 96° at Williamsburg,\r\nit was 110° at Kaskaskia. Perhaps the mountain,\r\nwhich overhangs this village on the north side, may, by its reflection,\r\nhave contributed somewhat to produce this heat. The\r\ndifference of temperature of the air at the sea-coast, or on the\r\nChesapeake bay, and at the Alleghany, has not been ascertained;\r\nbut contemporary observations, made at Williamsburg, or in its\r\nneighborhood, and at Monticello, which is on the most eastern\r\nridge of the mountains, called the South-West, where they are\r\nintersected by the Rivanna, have furnished a ratio by which that\r\ndifference may in some degree be conjectured. These observations\r\nmake the difference between Williamsburg and the nearest\r\nmountains, at the position before mentioned, to be on an\r\naverage 6⅓° of Fahrenheit's thermometer. Some allowance,\r\nhowever, is to be made for the difference of latitude between\r\nthese two places, the latter being 38° 8' 17\", which is 52' 22\"\r\nnorth of the former. By contemporary observations of between\r\nfive and six weeks, the averaged and almost unvaried difference\r\nof the height of mercury in the barometer, at those two places,\r\nwas .784 of an inch, the atmosphere at Monticello being so\r\nmuch the lightest, that is to say, about one-thirty-seventh of its\r\nwhole weight. It should be observed, however, that the hill of\r\nMonticello is of five hundred feet perpendicular height above the\r\nriver which washes its base. This position being nearly central\r\nbetween our northern and southern boundaries, and between the\r\nbay and Alleghany, may be considered as furnishing the best\r\naverage of the temperature of our climate. Williamsburg is\r\nmuch too near the south-eastern corner to give a fair idea of our\r\ngeneral temperature.\r\n\r\nBut a more remarkable difference is in the winds which prevail\r\nin the different parts of the country. The following table\r\nexhibits a comparative view of the winds prevailing at Williamsburg,\r\nand at Monticello. It is formed by reducing nine months'\r\nobservations at Monticello to four principal points, to wit, the\r\nnorth-east, south-east, south-west, and north-west; these points\r\nbeing perpendicular to, or parallel with our coast, mountains, and\r\nrivers; and by reducing in like manner, an equal number of observations,\r\nto wit, four hundred and twenty-one from the preceding\r\ntable of winds at Williamsburg, taking them proportionably\r\nfrom every point:\r\n\r\n                     N.E.  S.E.   S.W.   N.W.  Total.\r\n     Williamsburg    127    61    132    101    421\r\n     Monticello       32    91    126    172    421\r\n\r\nBy this it may be seen that the south-west wind prevails\r\nequally at both places; that the north-east is, next to this, the\r\nprincipal wind towards the sea-coast, and the north-west is the\r\npredominant wind at the mountains. The difference between\r\nthese two winds to sensation, and in fact, is very great. The\r\nnorth-east is loaded with vapor, insomuch, that the salt-makers\r\nhave found that their crystals would not shoot while that blows;\r\nit brings a distressing chill, and is heavy and oppressive to the\r\nspirits. The north-west is dry, cooling, elastic, and animating.\r\nThe eastern and south-eastern breezes come on generally in the\r\nafternoon. They have advanced into the country very sensibly\r\nwithin the memory of people now living. They formerly did\r\nnot penetrate far above Williamsburg. They are now frequent\r\nat Richmond, and every now and then reach the mountains.\r\nThey deposit most of their moisture, however, before they get\r\nthat far. As the lands become more cleared, it is probable they\r\nwill extend still further westward.\r\n\r\nGoing out into the open air, in the temperate, and warm\r\nmonths of the year, we often meet with bodies of warm air,\r\nwhich passing by us in two or three seconds, do not afford time\r\nto the most sensible thermometer to seize their temperature.\r\nJudging from my feelings only, I think they approach the ordinary\r\nheat of the human body. Some of them, perhaps, go a\r\nlittle beyond it. They are of about twenty to thirty feet diameter\r\nhorizontally. Of their height we have no experience, but\r\nprobably they are globular volumes wafted or rolled along with\r\nthe wind. But whence taken, where found, or how generated?\r\nThey are not to be ascribed to volcanos, because we have none.\r\nThey do not happen in the winter when the farmers kindle large\r\nfires in clearing up their grounds. They are not confined to the\r\nspring season, when we have fires which traverse whole counties,\r\nconsuming the leaves which have fallen from the trees. And\r\nthey are too frequent and general to be ascribed to accidental\r\nfires. I am persuaded their cause must be sought for in the atmosphere\r\nitself, to aid us in which I know but of these constant\r\ncircumstances: a dry air; a temperature as warm, at least, as that\r\nof the spring or autumn; and a moderate current of wind.\r\nThey are most frequent about sun-set; rare in the middle parts\r\nof the day; and I do not recollect having ever met with them in\r\nthe morning.\r\n\r\nThe variation in the weight of our atmosphere, as indicated\r\nby the barometer, is not equal to two inches of mercury. During\r\ntwelve months' observation at Williamsburg, the extremes\r\n29 and 30.86 inches, the difference being 1.86 of an inch; and\r\nin nine months, during which the height of the mercury was\r\nnoted at Monticello, the extremes were 28.48 and 29.69 inches,\r\nthe variation being 1.21 of an inch. A gentleman, who has observed\r\nhis barometer many years, assures me it has never varied\r\ntwo inches. Contemporary observations made at Monticello and\r\nWilliamsburg, proved the variations in the weight of air to be\r\nsimultaneous and corresponding in these two places.\r\n\r\nOur changes from heat to cold, and cold to heat, are very sudden\r\nand great. The mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer has\r\nbeen known to descend from 92° to 47° in thirteen hours.\r\n\r\nIt was taken for granted, that the preceding table of average\r\nheat will not give a false idea on this subject, as it proposes to\r\nstate only the ordinary heat and cold of each month, and not\r\nthose which are extraordinary. At Williamsburg, in August\r\n1766, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer was at 98°, corresponding\r\nwith 29⅓ of Reaumur. At the same place in January\r\n1780, it was 6°, corresponding with 11½ below zero of Reaumur.\r\nI believe[45] these may be considered to be nearly the extremes\r\nof heat and cold in that part of the country. The latter\r\nmay most certainly, as that time York river, at Yorktown, was\r\nfrozen over, so that people walked across it; a circumstance\r\nwhich proves it to have been colder than the winter of 1740,\r\n1741, usually called the cold winter, when York river did not\r\nfreeze over at that place. In the same season of 1780, Chesapeake\r\nbay was solid, from its head to the mouth of Potomac.\r\nAt Annapolis, where it is 5¼ miles over between the nearest\r\npoints of land, the ice was from five to seven inches thick quite\r\nacross, so that loaded carriages went over on it. Those, our extremes\r\nof heat and cold, of 6° and 98°, were indeed very distressing\r\nto us, and were thought to put the extent of the human\r\nconstitution to considerable trial. Yet a Siberian would have\r\nconsidered them as scarcely a sensible variation. At Jenniseitz\r\nin that country, in latitude 58° 27', we are told that the cold in\r\n1735 sunk the mercury by Fahrenheit's scale to 126° below nothing;\r\nand the inhabitants of the same country use stove rooms\r\ntwo or three times a week, in which they stay two hours at a\r\ntime, the atmosphere of which raises the mercury to 135° above\r\nnothing. Late experiments show that the human body will\r\nexist in rooms heated to 140° of Reaumur, equal to 347° of\r\nFahrenheit's, and 135° above boiling water. The hottest point\r\nof the twenty-four hours is about four o'clock, P. M., and the\r\ndawn of day the coldest.\r\n\r\nThe access of frost in autumn, and its recess the spring, do\r\nnot seem to depend merely on the degree of cold; much less on\r\nthe air's being at the freezing point. White frosts are frequent\r\nwhen the thermometer is at 47°, have killed young plants of\r\nIndian corn at 48°, and have been known at 54°. Black frost,\r\nand even ice, have been produced at 38½°, which is 6½ degrees\r\nabove the freezing point. That other circumstances must be\r\ncombined with this cold to produce frost, is evident from this\r\nalso, on the higher parts of mountains, where it is absolutely\r\ncolder than in the plains on which they stand, frosts do not appear\r\nso early by a considerable space of time in autumn, and go\r\noff sooner in the spring, than in the plains. I have known frosts\r\nso severe as to kill the hickory trees round about Monticello, and\r\nyet not injure the tender fruit blossoms then in bloom on the top\r\nand higher parts of the mountain; and in the course of forty\r\nyears, during which it had been settled, there have been but\r\ntwo instances of a general loss of fruit on it; while in the circumjacent\r\ncountry, the fruit has escaped but twice in the last\r\nseven years. The plants of tobacco, which grow from the roots\r\nof those which have been cut off in the summer, are frequently\r\ngreen here at Christmas. This privilege against the frost is undoubtedly\r\ncombined with the want of dew on the mountains.\r\nThat the dew is very rare on their higher parts, I may say with\r\ncertainty, from twelve years' observations, having scarcely ever,\r\nduring that time, seen an unequivocal proof of its existence on\r\nthem at all during summer. Severe frosts in the depth of winter\r\nprove that the region of dews extends higher in that season than\r\nthe tops of the mountains; but certainly, in the summer season,\r\nthe vapors, by the time they attain that height, are so attenuated\r\nas not to subside and form a dew when the sun retires.\r\n\r\nThe weavil has not yet ascended the high mountains.\r\n\r\nA more satisfactory estimate of our climate to some, may perhaps\r\nbe formed, by noting the plants which grow here, subject,\r\nhowever, to be killed by our severest colds. These are the fig,\r\npomegranate, artichoke, and European walnut. In mild winters,\r\nlettuce and endive require no shelter; but, generally, they need a\r\nslight covering. I do not know that the want of long moss,\r\nreed, myrtle, swamp laurel, holly, and cypress, in the upper\r\ncountry proceeds from a greater degree of cold, nor that they\r\nwere ever killed with any degree of cold, nor that they were\r\never killed with any degree of cold in the lower country. The\r\naloe lived in Williamsburg, in the open air, through the severe\r\nwinter of 1779, 1780.\r\n\r\nA change in our climate, however, is taking place very sensibly.\r\nBoth heats and colds are become much more moderate\r\nwithin the memory even of the middle-aged. Snows are less\r\nfrequent and less deep. They do not often lie, below the mountains,\r\nmore than one, two, or three days, and very rarely a week.\r\nThey are remembered to have been formerly frequent, deep, and\r\nof long continuance. The elderly inform me, the earth used to be\r\ncovered with snow about three months in every year. The\r\nrivers, which then seldom failed to freeze over in the course of\r\nthe winter, scarcely ever do so now. This change has produced\r\nan unfortunate fluctuation between heat and cold, in the spring\r\nof the year, which is very fatal to fruits. From the year 1741\r\nto 1769, an interval of twenty-eight years, there was no instance\r\nof fruit killed by the frost in the neighborhood of Monticello.\r\nAn intense cold, produced by constant snows, kept the buds\r\nlocked up till the sun could obtain, in the spring of the year, so\r\nfixed an ascendency as to dissolve those snows, and protect the\r\nbuds, during their development, from every danger of returning\r\ncold. The accumulated snows of the winter remaining to be\r\ndissolved all together in the spring, produced those overflowings\r\nof our rivers, so frequent then, and so rare now.\r\n\r\nHaving had occasion to mention the particular situation of\r\nMonticello for other purposes, I will just take notice that its elevation\r\naffords an opportunity of seeing a phenomenon which is\r\nrare at land, though frequent at sea. The seamen call it _looming_.\r\nPhilosophy is as yet in the rear of the seamen, for so far\r\nfrom having accounted for it, she has not given it a name. Its\r\nprincipal effect is to make distant objects appear larger, in opposition\r\nto the general law of vision, by which they are diminished.\r\nI knew an instance, at Yorktown, from whence the\r\nwater prospect eastwardly is without termination, wherein a\r\ncanoe with three men, at a great distance was taken for a ship\r\nwith its three masts. I am little acquainted with the phenomenon\r\nas it shows itself at sea; but at Monticello it is familiar.\r\nThere is a solitary mountain about forty miles off in the South,\r\nwhose natural shape, as presented to view there, is a regular\r\ncone; but by the effect of looming, it sometimes subsides almost\r\ntotally in the horizon; sometimes it rises more acute and more\r\nelevated; sometimes it is hemispherical; and sometimes its sides\r\nare perpendicular, its top flat, and as broad as its base. In short,\r\nit assumes at times the most whimsical shapes, and all these perhaps\r\nsuccessively in the same morning. The blue ridge of\r\nmountains comes into view, in the north-east, at about one hundred\r\nmiles distance, and approaching in a direct line, passes by\r\nwithin twenty miles, and goes off to the south-west. This phenomenon\r\nbegins to show itself on these mountains, at about\r\nfifty miles distance, and continues beyond that as far as they are\r\nseen. I remark no particular state, either in the weight, moisture,\r\nor heat of the atmosphere, necessary to produce this. The\r\nonly constant circumstances are its appearance in the morning\r\nonly, and on objects at least forty or fifty miles distant. In this\r\nlatter circumstance, if not in both, it differs from the looming on\r\nthe water. Refraction will not account for the metamorphosis.\r\nThat only changes the proportions of length and breadth, base\r\nand altitude, preserving the general outlines. Thus it may\r\nmake a circle appear elliptical, raise or depress a cone, but by\r\nnone of its laws, as yet developed, will it make a circle appear a\r\nsquare, or a cone a sphere.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [45] At Paris, in 1753, the mercury in Reaumur's thermometer\r\n         was at 30½ above zero, and in 1776, it was at 16 below\r\n         zero. The extremities of heat and cold therefore at Paris,\r\n         are greater than at Williamsburg, which is in the hottest\r\n         part of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY VIII.\r\n\r\n_The number of its inhabitants?_\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the number of persons imported\r\nfor the establishment of our colony in its infant state, and the\r\ncensus of inhabitants at different periods, extracted from our historians\r\nand public records, as particularly as I have had opportunities\r\nand leisure to examine them. Successive lines in the\r\nsame year show successive periods of time in that year. I have\r\nstated the census in two different columns, the whole inhabitants\r\nhaving been sometimes numbered, and sometimes the _tythes_\r\nonly. This term, with us, includes the free males above sixteen\r\nyears of age, and slaves above that age of both sexes. A further\r\nexamination of our records would render this history of our population\r\nmuch more satisfactory and perfect, by furnishing a greater\r\nnumber of intermediate terms. These, however, which are\r\nhere stated will enable us to calculate, with a considerable degree\r\nof precision, the rate at which we have increased. During\r\nthe infancy of the colony, while numbers were small, wars, importations,\r\nand other accidental circumstances render the progression\r\nfluctuating and irregular. By the year 1654, however,\r\nit becomes tolerably uniform, importations having in a great\r\nmeasure ceased from the dissolution of the company, and the inhabitants\r\nbecome too numerous to be sensibly affected by Indian\r\nwars. Beginning at that period, therefore, we find that from\r\nthence to the year 1772, our tythes had increased from 7,209 to\r\n153,000. The whole term being of one hundred and eighteen\r\nyears, yields a duplication once in every twenty-seven and a\r\nquarter years. The intermediate enumerations taken in 1700,\r\n1748, and 1759, furnish proofs of the uniformity of this progression.\r\nShould this rate of increase continue, we shall have\r\nbetween six and seven millions of inhabitants within ninety-five\r\nyears. If we suppose our country to be bounded, at some\r\nfuture day, by the meridian of the mouth of the Great Kanhaway,\r\n(within which it has been before conjectured, are 64,461\r\nsquare miles) there will then be one hundred inhabitants for\r\nevery square mile, which is nearly the state of population in the\r\nBritish Islands.\r\n\r\n     --------+--------------------+------------------------+-----------\r\n      Years. | Settlers Imported. | Census of Inhabitants. |  Census of\r\n             |                    |                        |    Tythes.\r\n     --------|--------------------+------------------------+-----------\r\n       1607  |         100        |              ...       |       ...\r\n             |         ...        |               40       |       ...\r\n             |         120        |              ...       |       ...\r\n       1608  |         ...        |              130       |       ...\r\n             |          70        |              ...       |       ...\r\n       1609  |         ...        |              490       |       ...\r\n             |          16        |              ...       |       ...\r\n             |         ...        |               60       |       ...\r\n       1610  |         150        |              ...       |       ...\r\n             |         ...        |              200       |       ...\r\n       1611  |    3 ship loads.   |              ...       |       ...\r\n             |         300        |              ...       |       ...\r\n       1612  |          80        |              ...       |       ...\r\n       1617  |         ...        |              400       |       ...\r\n       1618  |         200        |              ...       |       ...\r\n             |          40        |              ...       |       ...\r\n             |         ...        |              600       |       ...\r\n       1619  |       1,216        |              ...       |       ...\r\n       1621  |       1,300        |              ...       |       ...\r\n       1622  |         ...        |            3,800       |       ...\r\n             |         ...        |            2,500       |       ...\r\n       1628  |         ...        |            3,000       |       ...\r\n       1632  |         ...        |              ...       |      2,000\r\n       1644  |         ...        |              ...       |      4,822\r\n       1645  |         ...        |              ...       |      5,000\r\n       1652  |         ...        |              ...       |      7,000\r\n       1654  |         ...        |              ...       |      7,209\r\n       1700  |         ...        |              ...       |     22,000\r\n       1748  |         ...        |              ...       |     82,100\r\n       1759  |         ...        |              ...       |    105,000\r\n       1772  |         ...        |              ...       |    153,000\r\n       1782  |         ...        |          567,614       |\r\n     --------+--------------------+------------------------+-----------\r\n\r\nHere I will beg leave to propose a doubt. The present desire\r\nof America is to produce rapid population by as great importations\r\nof foreigners as possible. But is this founded in good\r\npolicy? The advantage proposed is the multiplication of numbers.\r\nNow let us suppose (for example only) that, in this state,\r\nwe could double our numbers in one year by the importation of\r\nforeigners; and this is a greater accession than the most sanguine\r\nadvocate for emigration has a right to expect. Then I\r\nsay, beginning with a double stock, we shall attain any given\r\ndegree of population only twenty-seven years, and three months\r\nsooner than if we proceed on our single stock. If we propose\r\nfour millions and a half as a competent population for this State,\r\nwe should be fifty-four and a half years attaining it, could we at\r\nonce double our numbers; and eighty-one and three quarter\r\nyears, if we rely on natural propagation, as may be seen by the\r\nfollowing tablet:\r\n\r\n                   Proceeding on       Proceeding on\r\n                 our present stock.   a double stock.\r\n\r\n     1781            567,614            1,135,228\r\n     1808¼         1,135,228            2,270,456\r\n     1835½         2,270,456            4,540,912\r\n     1862¾         4,540,912\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first column are stated periods of twenty-seven and a\r\nquarter years; in the second are our numbers at each period, as\r\nthey will be if we proceed on our actual stock; and in the third\r\nare what they would be, at the same periods, were we to set out\r\nfrom the double of our present stock. I have taken the term of\r\nfour million and a half of inhabitants for example's sake only.\r\nYet I am persuaded it is a greater number than the country\r\nspoken of, considering how much inarable land it contains, can\r\nclothe and feed without a material change in the quality of their\r\ndiet. But are there no inconveniences to be thrown into the\r\nscale against the advantage expected from a multiplication of\r\nnumbers by the importation of foreigners? It is for the happiness\r\nof those united in society to harmonize as much as possible\r\nin matters which they must of necessity transact together. Civil\r\ngovernment being the sole object of forming societies, its administration\r\nmust be conducted by common consent. Every\r\nspecies of government has its specific principles. Ours perhaps\r\nare more peculiar than those of any other in the universe. It is\r\na composition of the freest principles of the English constitution,\r\nwith others derived from natural right and natural reason. To\r\nthese nothing can be more opposed than the maxims of absolute\r\nmonarchies. Yet from such we are to expect the greatest number\r\nof emigrants. They will bring with them the principles of\r\nthe governments they leave, imbibed in their early youth; or, if\r\nable to throw them off, it will be in exchange for an unbounded\r\nlicentiousness, passing, as is usual, from one extreme to another.\r\nIt would be a miracle were they to stop precisely at the point of\r\ntemperate liberty. These principles, with their language, they\r\nwill transmit to their children. In proportion to their numbers,\r\nthey will share with us the legislation. They will infuse into it\r\ntheir spirit, warp and bias its directions, and render it a heterogenous,\r\nincoherent, distracted mass. I may appeal to experience,\r\nduring the present contest, for a verification of these conjectures.\r\nBut, if they be not certain in event, are they not possible, are\r\nthey not probable? Is it not safer to wait with patience twenty-seven\r\nyears and three months longer, for the attainment of any\r\ndegree of population desired or expected? May not our government\r\nbe more homogeneous, more peaceable, more durable?\r\nSuppose twenty millions of republican Americans thrown all of\r\na sudden into France, what would be the condition of that kingdom?\r\nIf it would be more turbulent, less happy, less strong, we\r\nmay believe that the addition of half a million of foreigners to\r\nour present numbers would produce a similar effect here. If\r\nthey come of themselves they are entitled to all the rights of\r\ncitizenship; but I doubt the expediency of inviting them by extraordinary\r\nencouragements. I mean not that these doubts\r\nshould be extended to the importation of useful artificers. The\r\npolicy of that measure depends on very different considerations.\r\nSpare no expense in obtaining them. They will after a while\r\ngo to the plough and the hoe; but, in the mean time, they will\r\nteach us something we do not know. It is not so in agriculture.\r\nThe indifferent state of that among us does not proceed from a\r\nwant of knowledge merely; it is from our having such quantities\r\nof land to waste as we please. In Europe the object is to\r\nmake the most of their land, labor being abundant; here it is to\r\nmake the most of our labor, land being abundant.\r\n\r\nIt will be proper to explain how the numbers for the year\r\n1782 have been obtained; as it was not from a perfect census of\r\nthe inhabitants. It will at the same time develope the proportion\r\nbetween the free inhabitants and slaves. The following return\r\nof taxable articles for that year was given in.\r\n\r\n      53,289 free males above twenty-one years of age.\r\n     211,698 slaves of all ages and sexes.\r\n      23,766 not distinguished in the returns, but said to be tytheable\r\n             slaves.\r\n     195,439 horses.\r\n     609,734 cattle.\r\n       5,126 wheels of riding-carriages.\r\n         191 taverns.\r\n\r\nThere were no returns from the eight counties of Lincoln,\r\nJefferson, Fayette, Monongahela, Yohogania, Ohio, Northampton,\r\nand York. To find the number of slaves which should\r\nhave been returned instead of the 23,766 tytheables, we must\r\nmention that some observations on a former census had given\r\nreason to believe that the numbers above and below sixteen\r\nyears of age were equal. The double of this number, therefore,\r\nto wit, 47,532 must be added to 211,698, which will give us\r\n259,230 slaves of all ages and sexes. To find the number of\r\nfree inhabitants we must repeat the observation that those above\r\nand below sixteen are nearly equal. But as the number 53,289\r\nomits the males below sixteen and twenty-one we must supply\r\nthem from conjecture. On a former experiment it had appeared\r\nthat about one-third of our militia, that is, of the males between\r\nsixteen and fifty, were unmarried. Knowing how early marriage\r\ntakes place here, we shall not be far wrong in supposing\r\nthat the unmarried part of our militia are those between sixteen\r\nand twenty-one. If there be young men who do not marry till\r\nafter twenty-one, there are many who marry before that age.\r\nBut as men above fifty were not included in the militia, we will\r\nsuppose the unmarried, or those between sixteen and twenty-one,\r\nto be one-fourth of the whole number above sixteen, then we\r\nhave the following calculation:\r\n\r\n       53,289 free males above twenty-one years of age.\r\n       17,763 free males between sixteen and twenty-one.\r\n       17,052 free males under sixteen.\r\n      142,104 free males of all ages.\r\n      -------\r\n      284,208 free inhabitants of all ages.\r\n      259,230 slaves of all ages.\r\n      -------\r\n      543,438 inhabitants, exclusive of the eight counties from\r\n              which were no returns. In these eight counties in the years\r\n              1779 and 1780, were 3,161 militia. Say then,\r\n        3,161 free males above the age of sixteen.\r\n        3,161 free males under sixteen.\r\n        6,322 free females.\r\n        -----\r\n       12,644 free inhabitants in these eight counties. To find the\r\n              number of slaves, say, as 284,208 to 259,230, so is 12,644\r\n              to 11,532. Adding the third of these numbers to the first,\r\n              and the fourth to the second, we have,\r\n      296,852 free inhabitants.\r\n      270,762 slaves.\r\n      -------\r\n      567,614 inhabitants of every age, sex and condition.\r\n\r\nBut 296,852, the number of free inhabitants, are to 270,762, the\r\nnumber of slaves, nearly as 11 to 10. Under the mild treatment\r\nour slaves experience, and their wholesome, though coarse food,\r\nthis blot in our country increases as fast, or faster than the\r\nwhites. During the regal government we had at one time obtained\r\na law which imposed such a duty on the importation of\r\nslaves as amounted nearly to a prohibition, when one inconsiderate\r\nassembly, placed under a peculiarity of circumstance,\r\nrepealed the law. This repeal met a joyful sanction from the\r\nthen reigning sovereign, and no devices, no expedients, which\r\ncould ever be attempted by subsequent assemblies, and they seldom\r\nmet without attempting them, could succeed in getting the\r\nroyal assent to a renewal of the duty. In the very first session\r\nheld under the republican government, the assembly passed a law\r\nfor the perpetual prohibition of the importation of slaves. This\r\nwill in some measure stop the increase of this great political and\r\nmoral evil, while the minds of our citizens may be ripening for\r\na complete emancipation of human nature.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY IX.\r\n\r\n_The number and condition of the Militia and Regular Troops,\r\nand their Pay?_\r\n\r\nThe following is a state of the militia, taken from returns of\r\n1780 and 1781, except in those counties marked with an asterisk,\r\nthe returns from which are somewhat older.\r\n\r\nEvery able-bodied freeman, between the ages of sixteen and\r\nfifty, is enrolled in the militia. Those of every county are\r\nformed into companies, and these again into one or more battalions,\r\naccording to the numbers in the county. They are commanded\r\nby colonels, and other subordinate officers, as in the\r\nregular service. In every county is a county-lieutenant, who\r\ncommands the whole militia of his county, but ranks only as a\r\ncolonel in the field. We have no general officers always existing.\r\nThese are appointed occasionally, when an invasion or insurrection\r\nhappens, and their commission determines with the\r\noccasion. The governor is head of the military, as well as civil\r\npower. The law requires every militia-man to provide himself\r\nwith the arms usual in the regular service. But this injunction\r\nwas always indifferently complied with, and the arms they had,\r\nhave been so frequently called for to arm the regulars, that in\r\nthe lower parts of the country they are entirely disarmed. In\r\nthe middle country a fourth or fifth part of them may have such\r\nfirelocks as they had provided to destroy the noxious animals\r\nwhich infest their farms; and on the western side of the Blue\r\nridge they are generally armed with rifles. The pay of our\r\nmilitia, as well as of our regulars, is that of the continental regulars.\r\nThe condition of our regulars, of whom we have none\r\nbut continentals, and part of a battalion of state troops, is so constantly\r\non the change, that a state of it at this day would not be\r\nits state a month hence. It is much the same with the condition\r\nof the other continental troops, which is well enough\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n     +--------------+--------------+---------+\r\n     |  Situation.  |  Counties.   | Militia.|\r\n     +--------------+--------------+---------+\r\n     |Westward of  {|Lincoln       |    600  |\r\n     |the          {|Jefferson     |    300  |\r\n     |Alleghany    {|Fayette       |    156  |\r\n     |4,458.       {|Ohio          |    ..   |\r\n     |             {|Monongalia    | *1,000  |\r\n     |             {|Washington    |   *829  |\r\n     |             {|Montgomery    |  1,071  |\r\n     |             {|Greenbriar    |    502  |\r\n     |              |              |         |\r\n     |Between the  {|Hampshire     |    930  |\r\n     |Alleghany    {|Berkeley      | *1,100  |\r\n     |  and        {|Frederick     |  1,143  |\r\n     |Blue Ridge.  {|Shenando      |   *925  |\r\n     |7,673.       {|Rockingham    |    875  |\r\n     |             {|Augusta       |  1,375  |\r\n     |             {|Rockbridge    |   *625  |\r\n     |             {|Boutetourt    |   *700  |\r\n     |              |              |         |\r\n     |Between the  {|Loudoun       |  1,746  |\r\n     |Blue Ridge   {|Faquier       |  1,078  |\r\n     |and Tide     {|Culpepper     |  1,513  |\r\n     |Waters.      {|Spotsylvania  |    480  |\r\n     |18,828.      {|Orange        |   *600  |\r\n     |             {|Louisa        |    603  |\r\n     |             {|Goochland     |   *550  |\r\n     |             {|Fluvanna      |   *296  |\r\n     |             {|Albemarle     |    873  |\r\n     |             {|Amherst       |    896  |\r\n     |             {|Buckingham    |   *625  |\r\n     |             {|Bedford       |  1,300  |\r\n     |             {|Henry         |  1,004  |\r\n     |             {|Pittsylvania  |   *725  |\r\n     |             {|Halifax       | *1,139  |\r\n     |             {|Charlotte     |    612  |\r\n     |             {|Prince Edward |    589  |\r\n     |             {|Cumberland    |    408  |\r\n     |             {|Powhatan      |    330  |\r\n     |             {|Amelia        | *1,125  |\r\n     |             {|Lunenburg     |    677  |\r\n     |             {|Mecklenburg   |  1,100  |\r\n     |             {|Brunswick     |    559  |\r\n     +--------------+--------------+---------+\r\n     |    On the Tide Waters, and in that    |\r\n     |    Parallel. 19,012.                  |\r\n     +--------------+--------------+---------+\r\n     |  Situation.  |  Counties.   | Militia.|\r\n     +--------------+--------------+---------+\r\n     |Between      {|Greensville   |    500  |\r\n     |James River  {|Dinwiddie     |   *750  |\r\n     |and          {|Chesterfield  |    665  |\r\n     |Carolina.    {|Prince George |    328  |\r\n     |6,959.       {|Surrey        |    380  |\r\n     |             {|Sussex        |   *700  |\r\n     |             {|Southampton   |    874  |\r\n     |             {|Isle of White |   *600  |\r\n     |             {|Nansemond     |   *644  |\r\n     |             {|Norfolk       |   *880  |\r\n     |             {|Prince Anne   |   *594  |\r\n     |              |              |         |\r\n     |Between      {|Henrico       |    619  |\r\n     |James &      {|Hanover       |    706  |\r\n     |York         {|New Kent      |   *418  |\r\n     |rivers.      {|Charles City  |    286  |\r\n     |3,009.       {|James City    |    235  |\r\n     |             {|Williamsburgh |    129  |\r\n     |             {|York          |   *244  |\r\n     |             {|Warwick       |   *100  |\r\n     |             {|Elizabeth City|    182  |\r\n     |              |              |         |\r\n     |Bet.

They were generally so badly manned as seldom to be\r\nin a condition for service. Since the perfect possession of our\r\nrivers assumed by the enemy, I believe we are left with a single\r\narmed boat only.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY XI.\r\n\r\n_A description of the Indians established in that State?_\r\n\r\nWhen the first effectual settlement of our colony was made,\r\nwhich was in 1607, the country from the sea-coast to the mountains,\r\nand from the Potomac to the most southern waters of James'\r\nriver, was occupied by upwards of forty different tribes of Indians.\r\nOf these the _Powhatans_, the _Mannahoacs_, and _Monacans_,\r\nwere the most powerful. Those between the seacoast and\r\nfalls of the rivers, were in amity with one another, and attached\r\nto the _Powhatans_ as their link of union. Those between the\r\nfalls of the rivers and the mountains, were divided into two confederacies;\r\nthe tribes inhabiting the head waters of Potomac and\r\nRappahannock, being attached to the _Mannahoacs_; and those\r\non the upper parts of James' river to the _Monacans_. But the\r\n_Monacans_ and their friends were in amity with the _Mannahoacs_\r\nand their friends, and waged joint and perpetual war against the\r\n_Powhatans_. We are told that the _Powhatans_, _Mannahoacs_,\r\nand _Monacans_, spoke languages so radically different, that interpreters\r\nwere necessary when they transacted business. Hence\r\nwe may conjecture, that this was not the case between all the\r\ntribes, and, probably, that each spoke the language of the nation\r\nto which it was attached; which we know to have been the case\r\nin many particular instances. Very possibly there may have\r\nbeen anciently three different stocks, each of which multiplying\r\nin a long course of time, had separated into so many little societies.\r\nThis practice results from the circumstance of their\r\nhaving never submitted themselves to any laws, any coercive\r\npower, any shadow of government. Their only controls are\r\ntheir manners, and that moral sense of right and wrong, which,\r\nlike the sense of tasting and feeling in every man, makes a part\r\nof his nature. An offence against these is punished by contempt,\r\nby exclusion from society, or, where the case is serious, as that\r\nof murder, by the individuals whom it concerns. Imperfect as\r\nthis species of coercion may seem, crimes are very rare among\r\nthem; insomuch that were it made a question, whether no law,\r\nas among the savage Americans, or too much law, as among\r\nthe civilized Europeans, submits man to the greatest evil, one\r\nwho has seen both conditions of existence would pronounce it\r\nto be the last; and that the sheep are happier of themselves, than\r\nunder care of the wolves. It will be said, that great societies\r\ncannot exist without government. The savages, therefore, break\r\nthem into small ones.\r\n\r\nThe territories of the _Powhatan_ confederacy, south of the Potomac,\r\ncomprehended about eight thousand square miles, thirty\r\ntribes, and two thousand four hundred warriors. Captain Smith\r\ntells us, that within sixty miles of Jamestown were five thousand\r\npeople, of whom one thousand five hundred were warriors.\r\nFrom this we find the proportion of their warriors to their whole\r\ninhabitants, was as three to ten. The _Powhatan_ confederacy,\r\nthen, would consist of about eight thousand inhabitants, which\r\nwas one for every square mile; being about the twentieth part\r\nof our present population in the same territory, and the hundredth\r\nof that of the British islands.\r\n\r\nBesides these were the _Nottoways_, living on Nottoway river,\r\nthe _Meherrins_ and _Tuteloes_ on Meherrin river, who were connected\r\nwith the Indians of Carolina, probably with the Chowanocs.\r\n\r\n                                  NORTH.\r\n       +-------------+----------------------------------------------+\r\n       |             |             MANNAHOACS.                      |\r\n       +-------------+-------------+--------------+---------+-------+\r\n       |             |  Tribes.    |Country.      |Cf.

The numbers of some of\r\nthem are again stated as they were in the year 1669, when an\r\nattempt was made by assembly to enumerate them. Probably\r\nthe enumeration is imperfect, and in some measure conjectural,\r\nand that a farther search into the records would furnish many\r\nmore particulars. What would be the melancholy sequel of their\r\nhistory, may, however, be argued from the census of 1669; by\r\nwhich we discover that the tribes therein enumerated were, in\r\nthe space of sixty-two years, reduced to about one-third of their\r\nformer numbers. Spirituous liquors, the small-pox, war, and an\r\nabridgement of territory to a people who lived principally on the\r\nspontaneous productions of nature, had committed terrible havoc\r\namong them, which generation, under the obstacles opposed to\r\nit among them, was not likely to make good. That the lands\r\nof this country were taken from them by conquest, is not so\r\ngeneral a truth as is supposed. I find in our historians and\r\nrecords, repeated proofs of purchase, which cover a considerable\r\npart of the lower country; and many more would doubtless be\r\nfound on further search. The upper country, we know, has\r\nbeen acquired altogether acquired by purchases made in the\r\nmost unexceptionable form.\r\n\r\nWestward of all these tribes, beyond the mountains, and extending\r\nto the great lakes, were the _Maffawomees_, a most powerful\r\nconfederacy, who harassed unremittingly the _Powhatans_\r\nand _Manahoacs_. These were probably the ancestors of tribes\r\nknown at present by the name of the _Six Nations_.\r\n\r\nVery little can now be discovered of the subsequent history\r\nof these tribes severally. The _Chickahominies_ removed about\r\nthe year 1661, to Mattapony river. Their chief, with one from\r\neach of the Pamunkies and Mattaponies, attended the treaty of\r\nAlbany in 1685. This seems to have been the last chapter in\r\ntheir history. They retained, however, their separate name so\r\nlate as 1705, and were at length blended with the Pamunkies\r\nand Mattaponies, and exist at present only under their names.\r\nThere remain of the _Mattaponies_ three or four men only, and\r\nhave more negro than Indian blood in them. They have lost\r\ntheir language, have reduced themselves, by voluntary sales, to\r\nabout fifty acres of land, which lie on the river of their own\r\nname, and have from time to time, been joining the Pamunkies,\r\nfrom whom they are distant but ten miles. The _Pamunkies_ are\r\nreduced to about ten or twelve men, tolerably pure from mixture\r\nwith other colors. The older ones among them preserve\r\ntheir language in a small degree, which are the last vestiges on\r\nearth, as far as we know, of the Powhatan language. They\r\nhave about three hundred acres of very fertile land, on Pamunkey\r\nriver, so encompassed by water that a gate shuts in the\r\nwhole. Of the _Nottoways_, not a male is left. A few women\r\nconstitute the remains of that tribe. They are seated on Nottoway\r\nriver, in Southampton country, on very fertile lands. At a\r\nvery early period, certain lands were marked out and appropriated\r\nto these tribes, and were kept from encroachment by the authority\r\nof the laws. They have usually had trustees appointed,\r\nwhose duty was to watch over their interests, and guard them\r\nfrom insult and injury.\r\n\r\nThe _Monacans_ and their friends, better known latterly by the\r\nname of _Tuscaroras_, were probably connected with the Massawomecs,\r\nor Five Nations. For though we are[46] told their languages\r\nwere so different that the intervention of interpreters was\r\nnecessary between them, yet do we also[47] learn that the Erigas,\r\na nation formerly inhabiting on the Ohio, were of the same\r\noriginal stock with the Five Nations, and that they partook also\r\nof the Tuscarora language. Their dialects might, by long separation,\r\nhave become so unlike as to be unintelligible to one another.\r\nWe know that in 1712, the Five Nations received the\r\nTuscaroras into their confederacy, and made them the Sixth Nation.\r\nThey received the Meherrins and Tuteloes also into their\r\nprotection; and it is most probable, that the remains of many\r\nother of the tribes, of whom we find no particular account, retired\r\nwestwardly in like manner, and were incorporated with\r\none or the other of the western tribes. (5.)\r\n\r\nI know of no such thing existing as an Indian monument; for\r\nI would not honor with that name arrow points, stone hatchets,\r\nstone pipes, and half-shapen images. Of labor on the large scale,\r\nI think there is no remain as respectable as would be a common\r\nditch for the draining of lands; unless indeed it would be\r\nthe barrows, of which many are to be found all over this country.\r\nThese are of different sizes, some of them constructed of\r\nearth, and some of loose stones. That they were repositories of\r\nthe dead, has been obvious to all; but on what particular occasion\r\nconstructed, was a matter of doubt. Some have thought\r\nthey covered the bones of those who have fallen in battles\r\nfought on the spot of interment. Some ascribed them to the\r\ncustom, said to prevail among the Indians, of collecting, at certain\r\nperiods, the bones of all their dead, wheresoever deposited at\r\nthe time of death. Others again supposed them the general\r\nsepulchres for towns, conjectured to have been on or near these\r\ngrounds; and this opinion was supported by the quality of the\r\nlands in which they are found, (those constructed of earth being\r\ngenerally in the softest and most fertile meadow-grounds on river\r\nsides,) and by a tradition, said to be handed down from the aboriginal\r\nIndians, that, when they settled in a town, the first person\r\nwho died was placed erect, and earth put about him, so as to\r\ncover and support him; that when another died, a narrow passage\r\nwas dug to the first, the second reclined against him, and\r\nthe cover of earth replaced, and so on. There being one of\r\nthese in my neighborhood, I wished to satisfy myself whether\r\nany, and which of these opinions were just. For this purpose I\r\ndetermined to open and examine it thoroughly. It was situated\r\non the low grounds of the Rivanna, about two miles above its\r\nprincipal fork, and opposite to some hills, on which had been an\r\nIndian town. It was of a spheroidical form, of about forty feet\r\ndiameter at the base, and had been of about twelve feet altitude,\r\nthough now reduced by the plough to seven and a half, having\r\nbeen under cultivation about a dozen years. Before this it was\r\ncovered with trees of twelve inches diameter, and round the base\r\nwas an excavation of five feet depth and width, from whence\r\nthe earth had been taken of which the hillock was formed. I\r\nfirst dug superficially in several parts of it, and came to collections\r\nof human bones, at different depths, from six inches to\r\nthree feet below the surface. These were lying in the utmost\r\nconfusion, some vertical, some oblique, some horizontal, and directed\r\nto every point of the compass, entangled and held together\r\nin clusters by the earth. Bones of the most distant parts were\r\nfound together, as, for instance, the small bones of the foot in\r\nthe hollow of a scull; many sculls would sometimes be in contact,\r\nlying on the face, on the side, on the back, top or bottom,\r\nso as, on the whole, to give the idea of bones emptied promiscuously\r\nfrom a bag or a basket, and covered over with earth,\r\nwithout any attention to their order. The bones of which the\r\ngreatest numbers remained, were sculls, jaw-bones, teeth, the\r\nbones of the arms, thighs, legs, feet and hands. A few ribs remained,\r\nsome vertebræ of the neck and spine, without their processes,\r\nand one instance only of the[48] bone which serves as a base\r\nto the vertebral column. The sculls were so tender, that they\r\ngenerally fell to pieces on being touched. The other bones were\r\nstronger. There were some teeth which were judged to be\r\nsmaller than those of an adult; a scull, which on a slight view,\r\nappeared to be that of an infant, but it fell to pieces on being\r\ntaken out, so as to prevent satisfactory examination; a rib, and a\r\nfragment of the under-jaw of a person about half grown; another\r\nrib of an infant; and a part of the jaw of a child, which had not\r\ncut its teeth. This last furnishing the most decisive proof of the\r\nburial of children here, I was particular in my attention to it.\r\nIt was part of the right half of the under-jaw. The processes,\r\nby which it was attenuated to the temporal bones, were entire, and\r\nthe bone itself firm to where it had been broken off, which, as\r\nnearly as I could judge, was about the place of the eye-tooth. Its\r\nupper edge, wherein would have been the sockets of the teeth, was\r\nperfectly smooth. Measuring it with that of an adult, by placing\r\ntheir hinder processes together, its broken end extended to the\r\npenultimate grinder of the adult. This bone was white, all the\r\nothers of a sand color. The bones of infants being soft, they probably\r\ndecay sooner, which might be the cause so few were found\r\nhere. I proceeded then to make a perpendicular cut through the\r\nbody of the barrow, that I might examine its internal structure.\r\nThis passed about three feet from its centre, was opened to the\r\nformer surface of the earth, and was wide enough for a man to\r\nwalk through and examine its sides. At the bottom, that is, on\r\nthe level of the circumjacent plain, I found bones; above these\r\na few stones, brought from a cliff a quarter of a mile off, and\r\nfrom the river one-eighth of a mile off; then a large interval of\r\nearth, then a stratum of bones, and so on. At one end of the\r\nsection were four strata of bones plainly distinguishable; at the\r\nother, three; the strata in one part not ranging with those in another.\r\nThe bones nearest the surface were least decayed. No\r\nholes were discovered in any of them, as if made with bullets,\r\narrows, or other weapons. I conjectured that in this barrow\r\nmight have been a thousand skeletons. Every one will readily\r\nseize the circumstances above related, which militate against the\r\nopinion, that it covered the bones only of persons fallen in\r\nbattle; and against the tradition also, which would make it the\r\ncommon sepulchre of a town, in which the bodies were placed\r\nupright, and touching each other. Appearances certainly indicate\r\nthat it has derived both origin and growth from the accustomary\r\ncollection of bones, and deposition of them together; that\r\nthe first collection had been deposited on the common surface\r\nof the earth, a few stones put over it, and then a covering of\r\nearth, that the second had been laid on this, had covered more\r\nor less of it in proportion to the number of bones, and was then\r\nalso covered with earth; and so on. The following are the\r\nparticular circumstances which give it this aspect. 1. The\r\nnumber of bones. 2. Their confused position. 3. Their being\r\nin different strata. 4. The strata in one part having no correspondence\r\nwith those in another. 5. The different states of decay\r\nin these strata, which seem to indicate a difference in the\r\ntime of inhumation. 6. The existence of infant bones among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut on whatever occasion they may have been made, they are\r\nof considerable notoriety among the Indians; for a party passing,\r\nabout thirty years ago, through the part of the country where\r\nthis barrow is, went through the woods directly to it, without\r\nany instructions or inquiry, and having staid about it for some\r\ntime, with expressions which were construed to be those of\r\nsorrow, they returned to the high road, which they had left\r\nabout half a dozen miles to pay this visit, and pursued their journey.\r\nThere is another barrow much resembling this, in the\r\nlow grounds of the south branch of Shenandoah, where it is\r\ncrossed by the road leading from the Rockfish gap to Staunton.\r\nBoth of these have, within these dozen years, been cleared of\r\ntheir trees and put under cultivation, are much reduced in their\r\nheight, and spread in width, by the plough, and will probably\r\ndisappear in time. There is another on a hill in the Blue\r\nRidge of mountains, a few miles north of Wood's gap, which is\r\nmade up of small stones thrown together. This has been opened\r\nand found to contain human bones, as the others do. There are\r\nalso many others in other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nGreat question has arisen from whence came those aboriginals\r\nof America? Discoveries, long ago made, were sufficient to show\r\nthat the passage from Europe to America was always practicable,\r\neven to the imperfect navigation of ancient times. In going\r\nfrom Norway to Iceland, from Iceland to Greenland, from Greenland\r\nto Labrador, the first traject is the widest; and this having\r\nbeen practised from the earliest times of which we have any account\r\nof that part of the earth, it is not difficult to suppose that\r\nthe subsequent trajects may have been sometimes passed. Again,\r\nthe late discoveries of Captain Cook, coasting from Kamschatka\r\nto California, have proved that if the two continents of Asia and\r\nAmerica be separated at all, it is only by a narrow strait. So that\r\nfrom this side also, inhabitants may have passed into America;\r\nand the resemblance between the Indians of America and the\r\neastern inhabitants of Asia, would induce us to conjecture, that\r\nthe former are the descendants of the latter, or the latter of the\r\nformer; excepting indeed the Esquimaux, who, from the same\r\ncircumstance of resemblance, and from identity of language,\r\nmust be derived from the Greenlanders, and these probably from\r\nsome of the northern parts of the old continent. A knowledge\r\nof their several languages would be the most certain evidence\r\nof their derivation which could be produced. In fact, it is the\r\nbest proof of the affinity of nations which ever can be referred\r\nto. How many ages have elapsed since the English, the Dutch,\r\nthe Germans, the Swiss, the Norwegians, Danes and Swedes\r\nhave separated from their common stock? Yet how many more\r\nmust elapse before the proofs of their common origin, which exist\r\nin their several languages, will disappear? It is to be lamented\r\nthen, very much to be lamented, that we have suffered\r\nso many of the Indian tribes already to extinguish, without our\r\nhaving previously collected and deposited in the records of literature,\r\nthe general rudiments at least of the languages they spoke.\r\nWere vocabularies formed of all the languages spoken in North\r\nand South America, preserving their appellations of the most\r\ncommon objects in nature, of those which must be present to\r\nevery nation barbarous or civilized, with the inflections of their\r\nnouns and verbs, their principles of regimen and concord, and\r\nthese deposited in all the public libraries, it would furnish opportunities\r\nto those skilled in the languages of the old world to compare\r\nthem with these, now, or at any future time, and hence to\r\nconstruct the best evidence of the derivation of this part of the\r\nhuman race.\r\n\r\nBut imperfect as is our knowledge of the tongues spoken in\r\nAmerica, it suffices to discover the following remarkable fact:\r\nArranging them under the radical ones to which they may be\r\npalpably traced, and doing the same by those of the red men of\r\nAsia, there will be found probably twenty in America, for one\r\nin Asia, of those radical languages, so called because if they\r\nwere ever the same they have lost all resemblance to one another.\r\nA separation into dialects may be the work of a few\r\nages only, but for two dialects to recede from one another till\r\nthey have lost all vestiges of their common origin, must require\r\nan immense course of time; perhaps not less than many people\r\ngive to the age of the earth. A greater number of those radical\r\nchanges of language having taken place among the red men of\r\nAmerica, proves them of greater antiquity than those of Asia.\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to state the nations and numbers of the\r\nAborigines which still exist in a respectable and independent\r\nform. And as their undefined boundaries would render it difficult\r\nto specify those only which may be within any certain\r\nlimits, and it may not be unacceptable to present a more general\r\nview of them, I will reduce within the form of a catalogue all\r\nthose within, and circumjacent to, the United States, whose\r\nnames and numbers have come to my notice. These are taken\r\nfrom four different lists, the first of which was given in the year\r\n1759 to General Stanwix by George Croghan, deputy agent for\r\nIndian affairs under Sir William Johnson; the second was drawn\r\nup by a French trader of considerable note, resident among the\r\nIndians many years, and annexed to Colonel Bouquet's printed\r\naccount of his expedition in 1764. The third was made out by\r\nCaptain Hutchins, who visited most of the tribes, by order, for\r\nthe purpose of learning their numbers, in 1768; and the fourth\r\nby John Dodge, an Indian trader, in 1779, except the numbers\r\nmarked *, which are from other information.\r\n\r\nINDIAN TRIBES.\r\n\r\n  +----------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |Northward and

They\r\nare seventy-four in number, of very unequal size and population.\r\nOf these thirty-five are on the tide waters, or in that parallel;\r\ntwenty-three are in the midlands, between the tide waters and\r\nBlue Ridge of mountains; eight between the Blue Ridge and\r\nAlleghany; and eight westward of the Alleghany.\r\n\r\nThe State, by another division, is formed into parishes, many\r\nof which are commensurate with the counties; but sometimes a\r\ncounty comprehends more than one parish, and sometimes a\r\nparish more than one county. This division had relation to the\r\nreligion of the State, a portion of the Anglican church, with a\r\nfixed salary, having been heretofore established in each parish.\r\nThe care of the poor was another object of the parochial division.\r\n\r\nWe have no townships. Our country being much intersected\r\nwith navigable waters, and trade brought generally to our doors,\r\ninstead of our being obliged to go in quest of it, has probably been\r\none of the causes why we have no towns of any consequence.\r\nWilliamsburg, which, till the year 1780, was the seat of our\r\ngovernment, never contained above 1,800 inhabitants; and Norfolk,\r\nthe most populous town we ever had, contained but 6,000.\r\nOur towns, but more properly our villages and hamlets, are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nOn _James River_ and its waters, Norfolk, Portsmouth, Hampton,\r\nSuffolk, Smithfield, Williamsburg, Petersburg, Richmond,\r\nthe seat of our government, Manchester, Charlottesville, New\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nOn _York River_ and its waters, York, Newcastle, Hanover.\r\n\r\nOn _Rappahannock_, Urbanna, Port-Royal, Fredericksburg, Falmouth.\r\n\r\nOn _Potomac_ and its waters, Dumfries, Colchester, Alexandria,\r\nWinchester, Staunton.\r\n\r\nOn _Ohio_, Louisville.\r\n\r\nThere are other places at which, like some of the foregoing,\r\nthe _laws_ have said there shall be towns; but _nature_ has said\r\nthere shall not, and they remain unworthy of enumeration. _Norfolk_\r\nwill probably be the emporium for all the trade of the\r\nChesapeake bay and its waters; and a canal of eight or ten\r\nmiles will bring to it all that of Albemarle sound and its waters.\r\nSecondary to this place, are the towns at the head of the tide\r\nwaters, to wit, Petersburg on Appomattox; Richmond on James\r\nriver; Newcastle on York river; Alexandria on Potomac, and\r\nBaltimore on Patapsco. From these the distribution will be to\r\nsubordinate situations in the country. Accidental circumstances,\r\nhowever, may control the indications of nature, and in no instance\r\ndo they do it more frequently than in the rise and fall of\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY XIII.\r\n\r\n_The constitution of the State and its several charters?_\r\n\r\nQueen Elizabeth by her letters patent, bearing date March 25,\r\n1584, licensed Sir Walter Raleigh to search for remote heathen\r\nlands, not inhabited by Christian people, and granted to him in\r\nfee simple, all the soil within two hundred leagues of the places\r\nwhere his people should, within six years, make their dwellings\r\nor abidings; reserving only to herself and her successors, their\r\nallegiance and one-fifth part of all the gold and silver ore they\r\nshould obtain. Sir Walter immediately sent out two ships, which\r\nvisited Wococon island in North Carolina, and the next year despatched\r\nseven with one hundred and seven men, who settled in\r\nRoanoke island, about latitude 35° 50'. Here Okisko, king of the\r\nWeopomeiocs, in a full council of his people is said to have acknowledged\r\nhimself the homager of the Queen of England,\r\nand, after her, of Sir Walter Raleigh. A supply of fifty men\r\nwere sent in 1586, and one hundred and fifty in 1587. With\r\nthese last Sir Walter sent a governor, appointed him twelve\r\nassistants, gave them a charter of incorporation, and instructed\r\nthem to settle on Chesapeake bay. They landed, however, at\r\nHatorask. In 1588, when a fleet was ready to sail with a new\r\nsupply of colonists and necessaries, they were detained by the\r\nQueen to assist against the Spanish armada. Sir Walter having\r\nnow expended £40,000 in these enterprises, obstructed occasionally\r\nby the crown without a shilling of aid from it, was under\r\na necessity of engaging others to adventure their money.\r\nHe, therefore, by deed bearing date the 7th of March, 1589, by\r\nthe name of Sir Walter Raleigh, Chief Governor of Assamàcomòc,\r\n(probably Acomàc,) alias Wingadacoia, alias Virginia, granted\r\nto Thomas Smith and others, in consideration of their adventuring\r\ncertain sums of money, liberty to trade to this new\r\ncountry free from all customs and taxes for seven years, excepting\r\nthe fifth part of the gold and silver ore to be obtained; and\r\nstipulated with them and the other assistants, then in Virginia,\r\nthat he would confirm the deed of incorporation which he had\r\ngiven in 1587, with all the prerogatives, jurisdictions, royalties\r\nand privileges granted to him by the Queen. Sir Walter, at different\r\ntimes, sent five other adventurers hither, the last of which\r\nwas in 1602; for in 1603 he was attainted and put into close\r\nimprisonment, which put an end to his cares over his infant\r\ncolony. What was the particular fate of the colonists he had\r\nbefore sent and seated, has never been known; whether they\r\nwere murdered, or incorporated with the savages.\r\n\r\nSome gentlemen and merchants, supposing that by the attainder\r\nof Sir Walter Raleigh the grant to him was forfeited, not\r\ninquiring over carefully whether the sentence of an English\r\ncourt could affect lands not within the jurisdiction of that court,\r\npetitioned king James for a new grant of Virginia to them. He\r\naccordingly executed a grant to Sir Thomas Gates and others,\r\nbearing date the 9th of March, 1607, under which, in the same\r\nyear, a settlement was effected at Jamestown, and ever after\r\nmaintained. Of this grant, however, no particular notice need\r\nbe taken, as it was superceded by letters patent of the same king,\r\nof May 23, 1609, to the Earl of Salisbury and others, incorporating\r\nthem by the name of \"The Treasurer and company of\r\nAdventurers and Planters of the City of London for the first\r\ncolony in Virginia,\" granting to them and their successors all the\r\nlands in Virginia from Point Comfort along the sea-coast, to the\r\nnorthward two hundred miles, and from the same point along the\r\nsea-coast to the southward two hundred miles, and all the space\r\nfrom this precinct on the sea-coast up into the land, west and\r\nnorth-west, from sea to sea, and the islands within one hundred\r\nmiles of it, with all the communities, jurisdictions, royalties,\r\nprivileges, franchises, and pre-eminencies, within the same, and\r\nthereto and thereabouts, by sea and land, appertaining in as\r\nample manner as had before been granted to any adventurer; to\r\nbe held of the king and his successors, in common soccage,\r\nyielding one-fifth part of the gold and silver ore to be therein\r\nfound, for all manner of services; establishing a counsel in England\r\nfor the direction of the enterprise, the members of which\r\nwere to be chosen and displaced by the voice of the majority of\r\nthe company and adventurers, and were to have the nomination\r\nand revocation of governors, officers, and ministers, which by\r\nthem should be thought needful for the colony, the power of establishing\r\nlaws and forms of government and magistracy, obligatory\r\nnot only within the colony, but also on the seas in going\r\nand coming to and from it; authorizing them to carry thither any\r\npersons who should consent to go, freeing them forever from all\r\ntaxes and impositions on any goods or merchandise on importations\r\ninto the colony, or exportation out of it, except the five per\r\ncent. due for custom on all goods imported into the British dominions,\r\naccording to the ancient trade of merchants; which five\r\nper cent. only being paid they might, within thirteen months,\r\nre-export the same goods into foreign parts, without any custom,\r\ntax, or other duty, to the king or any of his officers, or deputies;\r\nwith powers of waging war against those who should annoy\r\nthem; giving to the inhabitants of the colony all the rights of\r\nnatural subjects, as if born and abiding in England; and declaring\r\nthat these letters should be construed, in all doubtful parts,\r\nin such manner as should be most for the benefit of the grantees.\r\n\r\nAfterwards on the 12th of March, 1612, by other letters patent,\r\nthe king added to his former grants, all islands in any part of the\r\nocean between the 30th and 41st degrees of latitude, and within\r\nthree hundred leagues of any of the parts before granted to the\r\ntreasurer and company, not being possessed or inhabited by any\r\nother Christian prince or state, nor within the limits of the northern\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the authorities given to the company by these\r\ncharters, and more especially of that part in the charter of 1609,\r\nwhich authorized them to establish a form of government, they\r\non the 24th of July, 1621, by charter under their common seal,\r\ndeclared that from thenceforward there should be two supreme\r\ncouncils in Virginia, the one to be called the council of state, to\r\nbe placed and displaced by the treasurer, council in England, and\r\ncompany from time to time, whose office was to be that of assisting\r\nand advising the governor; the other to be called the\r\ngeneral assembly, to be convened by the governor once yearly or\r\noftener, which was to consist of the council of state, and two\r\nburgesses out of every town, hundred, or plantation, to be respectively\r\nchosen by the inhabitants. In this all matters were\r\nto be decided by the greater part of the votes present; reserving\r\nto the governor a negative voice; and they were to have power\r\nto treat, consult, and conclude all emergent occasions concerning\r\nthe public weal, and to make laws for the behoof and government\r\nof the colony, imitating and following the laws and policy\r\nof England as nearly as might be; providing that these laws\r\nshould have no force till ratified in a general court of the company\r\nin England, and returned under their common seal; and\r\ndeclaring that, after the government of the colony should be\r\nwell framed and settled, no orders of the council in England\r\nshould bind the colony unless ratified in the said general assembly.\r\nThe king and company quarrelled, and by a mixture of\r\nlaw and force, the latter were ousted of all their rights without retribution,\r\nafter having expended one hundred thousand pounds in\r\nestablishing the colony, without the smallest aid from government.\r\nKing James suspended their powers by proclamation of\r\nJuly 15, 1624, and Charles I. took the government into his own\r\nhands. Both sides had their partisans in the colony, but, in\r\ntruth, the people of the colony in general thought themselves\r\nlittle concerned in the dispute. There being three parties interested\r\nin these several charters, what passed between the first and\r\nsecond, it was thought could not affect the third. If the king\r\nseized on the powers of the company, they only passed into other\r\nhands, without increase or diminution, while the rights of the\r\npeople remained as they were. But they did not remain so long.\r\nThe northern parts of their country were granted away to the\r\nlords Baltimore and Fairfax; the first of these obtaining also the\r\nrights of separate jurisdiction and government. And in 1650 the\r\nparliament, considering itself as standing in the place of their deposed\r\nking, and as having succeeded to all his powers, without\r\nas well as within the realm, began to assume a right over the\r\ncolonies, passing an act for inhibiting their trade with foreign nations.\r\nThis succession to the exercise of kingly authority gave\r\nthe first color for parliamentary interference with the colonies,\r\nand produced that fatal precedent which they continued to follow,\r\nafter they had retired, in other respects, within their proper\r\nfunctions. When this colony, therefore, which still maintained\r\nits opposition to Cromwell and the parliament, was induced in\r\n1651 to lay down their arms, they previously secured their most\r\nessential rights by a solemn convention, which, having never\r\nseen in print, I will here insert literally from the records.\r\n\r\n     \"ARTICLES agreed on and concluded at James Cittie in Virginia\r\n     for the surrendering and settling of that plantation under\r\n     the obedience and government of the commonwealth of England\r\n     by the commissioners of the Councill of State by authoritie\r\n     of the parliamt of England, and by the Grand assembly of the\r\n     Governour, Councill, and Burgesses of that countrey.\r\n\r\n     \"First it is agreed and consted that the plantation of Virginia,\r\n     and all the inhabitants thereof, shall be and remain in due\r\n     obedience and subjection to the Commonwealth of England,\r\n     according to the laws there established, and that this\r\n     submission and subscription bee acknowledged a voluntary act\r\n     not forced nor constrained by a conquest upon the countrey, and\r\n     that they shall have and enjoy such freedoms and priviledges\r\n     as belong to the free borne people of England, and that the\r\n     former government by the Commissions and Instructions be void\r\n     and null.\r\n\r\n     \"2ly. That the Grand assembly as formerly shall convene and\r\n     transact the affairs of Virginia, wherein nothing is to be\r\n     acted or done contrairie to the government of the Commonwealth\r\n     of England and the lawes there established.\r\n\r\n     \"3ly.

Yet in every of these points was this convention\r\nviolated by subsequent kings and parliaments, and other\r\ninfractions of their constitution, equally dangerous committed.\r\nTheir general assembly, which was composed of the council of\r\nstate and burgesses, sitting together and deciding by plurality\r\nof voices, was split into two houses, by which the council obtained\r\na separate negative on their laws. Appeals from their\r\nsupreme court, which had been fixed by law in their general assembly,\r\nwere arbitrarily revoked to England, to be there heard\r\nbefore the king and council. Instead of four hundred miles on\r\nthe seacoast, they were reduced, in the space of thirty years, to\r\nabout one hundred miles. Their trade with foreigners was totally\r\nsuppressed, and when carried to Great Britain, was there\r\nloaded with imposts. It is unnecessary, however, to glean up\r\nthe several instances of injury, as scattered through American\r\nand British history, and the more especially as, by passing on to\r\nthe accession of the present king, we shall find specimens of\r\nthem all, aggravated, multiplied and crowded within a small\r\ncompass of time, so as to evince a fixed design of considering\r\nour rights natural, conventional and chartered as mere nullities.\r\nThe following is an epitome of the first sixteen years of his\r\nreign: The colonies were taxed internally and externally; their\r\nessential interests sacrificed to individuals in Great Britain; their\r\nlegislatures suspended; charters annulled; trials by juries taken\r\naway; their persons subjected to transportation across the Atlantic,\r\nand to trial before foreign judicatories; their supplications\r\nfor redress thought beneath answer; themselves published as\r\ncowards in the councils of their mother country and courts of\r\nEurope; armed troops sent among them to enforce submission\r\nto these violences; and actual hostilities commenced against\r\nthem. No alternative was presented but resistance, or unconditional\r\nsubmission. Between these could be no hesitation.\r\nThey closed in the appeal to arms. They declared themselves\r\nindependent states. They confederated together into one great\r\nrepublic; thus securing to every State the benefit of an union\r\nof their whole force. In each State separately a new form of\r\ngovernment was established. Of ours particularly the following\r\nare the outlines: The executive powers are lodged in the hands\r\nof a governor, chosen annually, and incapable of acting more\r\nthen three years in seven. He is assisted by a council of eight\r\nmembers. The judiciary powers are divided among several\r\ncourts, as will be hereafter explained. Legislation is exercised\r\nby two houses of assembly, the one called the house of Delegates,\r\ncomposed of two members from each county, chosen annually\r\nby the citizens, possessing an estate for life in one hundred\r\nacres of uninhabited land, or twenty-five acres with a house\r\non it, or in a house or lot in some town: the other called the\r\nSenate, consisting of twenty-four members, chosen quadrenially\r\nby the same electors, who for this purpose are distributed into\r\ntwenty-four districts. The concurrence of both houses is necessary\r\nto the passage of a law. They have the appointment of the\r\ngovernor and council, the judges of the superior courts, auditors,\r\nattorney-general, treasurer, register of the land office, and delegates\r\nto Congress. As the dismemberment of the State had\r\nnever had its confirmation, but, on the contrary, had always\r\nbeen the subject of protestation and complaint, that it might\r\nnever be in our own power to raise scruples on that subject, or to\r\ndisturb the harmony of our new confederacy, the grants to Maryland,\r\nPennsylvania, and the two Carolinas, were ratified.\r\n\r\nThis constitution was formed when we were new and unexperienced\r\nin the science of government. It was the first, too,\r\nwhich was formed in the whole United States. No wonder then\r\nthat time and trial have discovered very capital defects in it.\r\n\r\n1. The majority of the men in the State, who pay and fight\r\nfor its support, are unrepresented in the legislature, the roll of\r\nfreeholders entitled to vote not including generally the half of\r\nthose on the roll of the militia, or of the tax-gatherers.\r\n\r\n2. Among those who share the representation, the shares are\r\nvery unequal. Thus the county of Warwick, with only one\r\nhundred fighting men, has an equal representation with the\r\ncounty of Loudon, which has one thousand seven hundred and\r\nforty-six. So that every man in Warwick has as much influence\r\nin the government as seventeen men in Loudon. But lest it\r\nshould be thought that an equal interspersion of small among\r\nlarge counties, through the whole State, may prevent any danger\r\nof injury to particular parts of it, we will divide it into districts,\r\nand show the proportions of land, of fighting men, and of representation\r\nin each:\r\n\r\n     Between the sea-coast and    Square   Fighting  Delegates. Senators.\r\n         falls of the rivers      miles.     men.\r\n                                [53]11,205   19,012     71          12\r\n     Between the falls of the\r\n         rivers and Blue Ridge      18,759   18,828     46           8\r\n         of mountains\r\n     Between the Blue Ridge\r\n         and the Alleghany          11,911    7,673     16           2\r\n     Between the Alleghany      [54]79,650    4,458     16           2\r\n          and Ohio             ----------- ---------  -----        ----\r\n                 Total             121,525   49,971    149          24\r\n\r\nAn inspection of this table will supply the place of commentaries\r\non it. It will appear at once that nineteen thousand men,\r\nliving below the falls of the rivers, possess half the senate, and\r\nwant four members only of possessing a majority of the house of\r\ndelegates; a want more than supplied by the vicinity of their\r\nsituation to the seat of government, and of course the greater degree\r\nof convenience and punctuality with which their members\r\nmay and will attend in the legislature. These nineteen thousand,\r\ntherefore, living in one part of the country, give law to upwards\r\nof thirty thousand living in another, and appoint all their chief\r\nofficers, executive and judiciary. From the difference of their\r\nsituation and circumstances, their interests will often be very different.\r\n\r\n3. The senate is, by its constitution, too homogenous with the\r\nhouse of delegates. Being chosen by the same electors, at the\r\nsame time, and out of the same subjects, the choice falls of course\r\non men of the same description. The purpose of establishing\r\ndifferent houses of legislation is to introduce the influence of different\r\ninterests or different principles. Thus in Great Britain it\r\nis said their constitution relies on the house of commons for honesty,\r\nand the lords for wisdom; which would be a rational reliance,\r\nif honesty were to be bought with money, and if wisdom\r\nwere hereditary. In some of the American States, the delegates\r\nand senators are so chosen, as that the first represent the persons,\r\nand the second the property of the State. But with us, wealth\r\nand wisdom have equal chance for admission into both houses.\r\nWe do not, therefore, derive from the separation of our legislature\r\ninto two houses, those benefits which a proper complication\r\nof principles are capable of producing, and those which alone can\r\ncompensate the evils which may be produced by their dissensions.\r\n\r\n4. All the powers of government, legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary, result to the legislative body. The concentrating\r\nthese in the same hands is precisely the definition of despotic\r\ngovernment. It will be no alleviation that these powers will be\r\nexercised by a plurality of hands, and not by a single one. One\r\nhundred and seventy-three despots would surely be as oppressive\r\nas one. Let those who doubt it turn their eyes on the republic\r\nof Venice. As little will it avail us that they are chosen by ourselves.\r\nAn _elective despotism_ was not the government we fought\r\nfor, but one which should not only be founded on free principles,\r\nbut in which the powers of government should be so divided and\r\nbalanced among several bodies of magistracy, as that no one\r\ncould transcend their legal limits, without being effectually\r\nchecked and restrained by the others. For this reason that convention\r\nwhich passed the ordinance of government, laid its foundation\r\non this basis, that the legislative, executive, and judiciary\r\ndepartments should be separate and distinct, so that no person\r\nshould exercise the powers of more than one of them at the same\r\ntime. But no barrier was provided between these several powers.\r\nThe judiciary and executive members were left dependent\r\non the legislative, for their subsistence in office, and some of\r\nthem for their continuance in it. If, therefore, the legislature\r\nassumes executive and judiciary powers, no opposition is likely\r\nto be made; nor, if made, can it be effectual; because in that\r\ncase they may put their proceedings into the form of an act of\r\nassembly, which will render them obligatory on the other\r\nbranches. They have, accordingly, in many instances, decided\r\nrights which should have been left to judiciary controversy; and\r\nthe direction of the executive, during the whole time of their\r\nsession, is becoming habitual and familiar. And this is done\r\nwith no ill intention. The views of the present members are\r\nperfectly upright. When they are led out of their regular province,\r\nit is by art in others, and inadvertence in themselves. And\r\nthis will probably be the case for some time to come. But it\r\nwill not be a very long time. Mankind soon learn to make interested\r\nuses of every right and power which they possess, or\r\nmay assume. The public money and public liberty, intended to\r\nhave been deposited with three branches of magistracy, but found\r\ninadvertently to be in the hands of one only, will soon be discovered\r\nto be sources of wealth and dominion to those who hold\r\nthem; distinguished, too, by this tempting circumstance, that\r\nthey are the instrument, as well as the object of acquisition.\r\nWith money we will get men, said Cæsar, and with men we will\r\nget money. Nor should our assembly be deluded by the integrity\r\nof their own purposes, and conclude that these unlimited\r\npowers will never be abused, because themselves are not disposed\r\nto abuse them. They should look forward to a time, and that\r\nnot a distant one, when a corruption in this, as in the country\r\nfrom which we derive our origin, will have seized the heads of\r\ngovernment, and be spread by them through the body of the\r\npeople; when they will purchase the voices of the people, and\r\nmake them pay the price. Human nature is the same on every\r\nside of the Atlantic, and will be alike influenced by the same\r\ncauses. The time to guard against corruption and tyranny, is\r\nbefore they shall have gotten hold of us. It is better to keep the\r\nwolf out of the fold, than to trust to drawing his teeth and talons\r\nafter he shall have entered. To render these considerations the\r\nmore cogent, we must observe in addition:\r\n\r\n5. That the ordinary legislature may alter the constitution itself.\r\nOn the discontinuance of assemblies, it became necessary\r\nto substitute in their place some other body, competent to the\r\nordinary business of government, and to the calling forth the\r\npowers of the State for the maintenance of our opposition to\r\nGreat Britain. Conventions were therefore introduced, consisting\r\nof two delegates from each county, meeting together and\r\nforming one house, on the plan of the former house of burgesses,\r\nto whose places they succeeded. These were at first chosen\r\nanew for every particular session. But in March 1775, they\r\nrecommended to the people to choose a convention, which should\r\ncontinue in office a year. This was done, accordingly, in April\r\n1775, and in the July following that convention passed an ordinance\r\nfor the election of delegates in the month of April annually.\r\nIt is well known, that in July 1775, a separation from\r\nGreat Britain and establishment of republican government, had\r\nnever yet entered into any person's mind. A convention, therefore,\r\nchosen under that ordinance, cannot be said to have been\r\nchosen for the purposes which certainly did not exist in the\r\nminds of those who passed it. Under this ordinance, at the\r\nannual election in April 1776, a convention for the year was\r\nchosen. Independence, and the establishment of a new form of\r\ngovernment, were not even yet the objects of the people at large.\r\nOne extract from the pamphlet called Common Sense had appeared\r\nin the Virginia papers in February, and copies of the\r\npamphlet itself had got in a few hands. But the idea had\r\nnot been opened to the mass of the people in April, much less\r\ncan it be said that they had made up their minds in its favor.\r\n\r\nSo that the electors of April 1776, no more than the legislators\r\nof July 1775, not thinking of independence and a permanent\r\nrepublic, could not mean to vest in these delegates powers\r\nof establishing them, or any authorities other than those of the\r\nordinary legislature. So far as a temporary organization of\r\ngovernment was necessary to render our opposition energetic, so\r\nfar their organization was valid. But they received in their creation\r\nno power but what were given to every legislature before\r\nand since. They could not, therefore, pass an act transcendent\r\nto the powers of other legislatures. If the present assembly\r\npass an act, and declare it shall be irrevocable by subsequent assemblies,\r\nthe declaration is merely void, and the act repealable,\r\nas other acts are. So far, and no farther authorized, they organized\r\nthe government by the ordinance entitled a constitution\r\nor form of government. It pretends to no higher authority than\r\nthe other ordinances of the same session; it does not say that it\r\nshall be perpetual; that it shall be unalterable by other legislatures;\r\nthat it shall be transcendent above the powers of those\r\nwho they knew would have equal power with themselves. Not\r\nonly the silence of the instrument is a proof they thought it\r\nwould be alterable, but their own practice also; for this very\r\nconvention, meeting as a house of delegates in general assembly\r\nwith the Senate in the autumn of that year, passed acts of assembly\r\nin contradiction to their ordinance of government; and\r\nevery assembly from that time to this has done the same. I am\r\nsafe, therefore, in the position that the constitution itself is alterable\r\nby the ordinary legislature. Though this opinion seems founded\r\non the first elements of common sense, yet is the contrary maintained\r\nby some persons. 1. Because, say they, the conventions\r\nwere vested with every power necessary to make effectual opposition\r\nto Great Britain. But to complete this argument, they\r\nmust go on, and say further, that effectual opposition could not\r\nbe made to Great Britain without establishing a form of government\r\nperpetual and unalterable by the legislature; which is not\r\ntrue. An opposition which at some time or other was to come\r\nto an end, could not need a perpetual institution to carry it on;\r\nand a government amendable as its defects should be discovered,\r\nwas as likely to make effectual resistance, as one that should be\r\nunalterably wrong. Besides, the assemblies were as much vested\r\nwith all powers requisite for resistance as the conventions were.\r\nIf, therefore, these powers included that of modelling the form\r\nof government in the one case, they did so in the other. The\r\nassemblies then as well as the conventions may model the government;\r\nthat is, they may alter the ordinance of government.\r\n2. They urge, that if the convention had meant that this instrument\r\nshould be alterable, as their other ordinances were, they\r\nwould have called it an ordinance; but they have called it a\r\n_constitution_, which, ex vi termini, means \"an act above the power\r\nof the ordinary legislature.\" I answer that _constitutio_, _constitutium_,\r\n_statutum_, _lex_, are convertible terms. \"_Constitutio_ dicitur\r\njus quod a principe conditure.\" \"_Constitutium_, quod ab imperatoribus\r\nrescriptum statutumve est.\" \"_Statutum_, idem quod\r\nlex.\" Calvini Lexicon juridicum. _Constitution_ and _statute_\r\nwere originally terms of the[55] civil law, and from thence introduced\r\nby ecclesiastics into the English law. Thus in the statute\r\n25 Hen. VIII. c. 19, §. 1, \"_Constitutions_ and _ordinances_\" are\r\nused as synonymous. The term _constitution_ has many other\r\nsignifications in physics and politics; but in jurisprudence, whenever\r\nit is applied to any act of the legislature, it invariably means\r\na statute, law, or ordinance, which is the present case. No inference\r\nthen of a different meaning can be drawn from the\r\nadoption of this title; on the contrary, we might conclude that,\r\nby their affixing to it a term synonymous with ordinance or\r\nstatute. But of what consequence is their meaning, where their\r\npower is denied? If they meant to do more than they had power\r\nto do, did this give them power? It is not the name, but the\r\nauthority that renders an act obligatory. Lord Coke says, \"an\r\narticle of the statute, 11 R. II. c. 5, that no person should attempt\r\nto revoke any ordinance then made, is repealed, for that\r\nsuch restraint is against the jurisdiction and power of the parliament.\"\r\n4. Inst. 42. And again, \"though divers parliaments have\r\nattempted to restrain subsequent parliaments, yet could they\r\nnever effect it; for the latter parliament hath ever power to abrogate,\r\nsuspend, qualify, explain, or make void the former in the\r\nwhole or in any part thereof, notwithstanding any words of restraint,\r\nprohibition, or penalty, in the former; for it is a maxim\r\nin the laws of the parliament, quod leges posteriores priores contrarias\r\nabrogant.\" 4. Inst. 43. To get rid of the magic supposed\r\nto be in the word _constitution_, let us translate it into its\r\ndefinition as given by those who think it above the power of the\r\nlaw; and let us suppose the convention, instead of saying, \"We\r\nthe ordinary legislature, establish a _constitution_,\" had said, \"We\r\nthe ordinary legislature, establish an act _above the power of the\r\nordinary legislature_.\" Does not this expose the absurdity of\r\nthe attempt? 3. But, say they, the people have acquiesced, and\r\nthis has given it an authority superior to the laws. It is true\r\nthat the people did not rebel against it; and was that a time for\r\nthe people to rise in rebellion? Should a prudent acquiescence,\r\nat a critical time, be construed into a confirmation of every illegal\r\nthing done during that period? Besides, why should they\r\nrebel? At an annual election they had chosen delegates for the\r\nyear, to exercise the ordinary powers of legislation, and to manage\r\nthe great contest in which they were engaged. These delegates\r\nthought the contest would be best managed by an organized\r\ngovernment. They therefore, among others, passed an ordinance\r\nof government. They did not presume to call it perpetual and\r\nunalterable. They well knew they had no power to make it\r\nso; that our choice of them had been for no such purpose, and\r\nat a time when we could have no such purpose in contemplation.\r\nHad an unalterable form of government been meditated, perhaps\r\nwe should have chosen a different set of people. There was no\r\ncause then for the people to rise in rebellion. But to what dangerous\r\nlengths will this argument lead? Did the acquiescence\r\nof the colonies under the various acts of power exercised by\r\nGreat Britain in our infant State, confirm these acts, and so far\r\ninvest them with the authority of the people as to render them\r\nunalterable, and our present resistance wrong? On every unauthoritative\r\nexercise of power by the legislature must the people\r\nrise in rebellion, or their silence be construed into a surrender\r\nof that power to them? If so, how many rebellions should\r\nwe have had already? One certainly for every session of assembly.\r\nThe other States in the union have been of opinion\r\nthat to render a form of government unalterable by ordinary acts\r\nof assembly, the people must delegate persons with special powers.\r\nThey have accordingly chosen special conventions to form\r\nand fix their governments. The individuals then who maintain\r\nthe contrary opinion in this country, should have the modesty to\r\nsuppose it possible that they may be wrong, and the rest of\r\nAmerica right. But if there be only a possibility of their being\r\nwrong, if only a plausible doubt remains of the validity of the\r\nordinance of government, is it not better to remove that doubt by\r\nplacing it on a bottom which none will dispute? If they be\r\nright we shall only have the unnecessary trouble of meeting once\r\nin convention. If they be wrong, they expose us to the hazard\r\nof having no fundamental rights at all. True it is, this is no\r\ntime for deliberating on forms of government. While an enemy\r\nis within our bowels, the first object is to expel him. But when\r\nthis shall be done, when peace shall be established, and leisure\r\ngiven us for intrenching within good forms, the rights for which\r\nwe have bled, let no man be found indolent enough to decline a\r\nlittle more trouble for placing them beyond the reach of question.\r\nIf anything more be requisite to produce a conviction of the expediency\r\nof calling a convention at a proper season to fix our\r\nform of government, let it be the reflection:\r\n\r\n6. That the assembly exercises a power of determining the\r\nquorum of their own body which may legislate for us. After\r\nthe establishment of the new form they adhered to the _Lex majoris\r\npartis_, founded in[56] common law as well as common right.\r\nIt is the[57] natural law of every assembly of men, whose numbers\r\nare not fixed by any other law. They continued for some time\r\nto require the presence of a majority of their whole number, to\r\npass an act. But the British parliament fixes its own quorum;\r\nour former assemblies fixed their own quorum; and one precedent\r\nin favor of power is stronger than an hundred against it.\r\nThe house of delegates, therefore, have[58] lately voted that, during\r\nthe present dangerous invasion, forty members shall be a house\r\nto proceed to business. They have been moved to this by the\r\nfear of not being able to collect a house. But this danger could\r\nnot authorize them to call that a house which was none; and if\r\nthey may fix it at one number, they may at another, till it loses\r\nits fundamental character of being a representative body. As\r\nthis vote expires with the present invasion, it is probable the\r\nformer rule will be permitted to revive; because at present no ill\r\nis meant. The power, however, of fixing their own quorum has\r\nbeen avowed, and a precedent set. From forty it may be reduced\r\nto four, and from four to one; from a house to a committee,\r\nfrom a committee to a chairman or speaker, and thus an\r\noligarchy or monarchy be substituted under forms supposed to\r\nbe regular. \"Omnia mala exempla ex bonis orta sunt; sed ubi\r\nimperium ad ignaros aut minus bonos pervenit, novum illud exemplum\r\nab dignis et idoneis indignos et non idoneos fertur.\"\r\nWhen, therefore, it is considered, that there is no legal obstacle\r\nto the assumption by the assembly of all the powers legislative,\r\nexecutive, and judiciary, and that these may come to the hands\r\nof the smallest rag of delegation, surely the people will say,\r\nand their representatives, while yet they have honest representatives,\r\nwill advise them to say, that they will not acknowledge\r\nas laws any acts not considered and assented to by the major\r\npart of their delegates.\r\n\r\nIn enumerating the defects of the constitution, it would be\r\nwrong to count among them what is only the error of particular\r\npersons. In December 1776, our circumstances being much distressed,\r\nit was proposed in the house of delegates to create a _dictator_,\r\ninvested with every power legislative, executive, and\r\njudiciary, civil and military, of life and of death, over our persons\r\nand over our properties; and in June 1781, again under\r\ncalamity, the same proposition was repeated, and wanted a few\r\nvotes only of being passed. One who entered into this contest\r\nfrom a pure love of liberty, and a sense of injured rights, who\r\ndetermined to make every sacrifice, and to meet every danger, for\r\nthe re-establishment of those rights on a firm basis, who did not\r\nmean to expend his blood and substance for the wretched purpose\r\nof changing this matter for that, but to place the powers of\r\ngoverning him in a plurality of hands of his own choice, so that\r\nthe corrupt will of no one man might in future oppress him,\r\nmust stand confounded and dismayed when he is told, that a\r\nconsiderable portion of that plurality had mediated the surrender\r\nof them into a single hand, and, in lieu of a limited monarchy,\r\nto deliver him over to a despotic one! How must we find his\r\nefforts and sacrifices abused and baffled, if he may still, by a\r\nsingle vote, be laid prostrate at the feet of one man! In God's\r\nname, from whence have they derived this power? Is it from\r\nour ancient laws? None such can be produced. Is it from any\r\nprinciple in our new constitution expressed or implied? Every\r\nlineament expressed or implied, is in full opposition to it. Its\r\nfundamental principle is, that the State shall be governed as a\r\ncommonwealth. It provides a republican organization, proscribes\r\nunder the name of _prerogative_ the exercise of all powers\r\nundefined by the laws; places on this basis the whole system of\r\nour laws; and by consolidating them together, chooses that they\r\nshould be left to stand or fall together, never providing for any\r\ncircumstances, nor admitting that such could arise, wherein\r\neither should be suspended; no, not for a moment. Our ancient\r\nlaws expressly declare, that those who are but delegates themselves\r\nshall not delegate to others powers which require judgment\r\nand integrity in their exercise. Or was this proposition\r\nmoved on a supposed right in the movers, of abandoning their\r\nposts in a moment of distress? The same laws forbid the abandonment\r\nof that post, even on ordinary occasions; and much\r\nmore a transfer of their powers into other hands and other forms,\r\nwithout consulting the people. They never admit the idea that\r\nthese, like sheep or cattle, may be given from hand to hand without\r\nan appeal to their own will. Was it from the necessity of\r\nthe case? Necessities which dissolve a government, do not convey\r\nits authority to an oligarchy or a monarchy. They throw\r\nback, into the hands of the people, the powers they had delegated,\r\nand leave them as individuals to shift for themselves. A\r\nleader may offer, but not impose himself, nor be imposed on them.\r\nMuch less can their necks be submitted to his sword, their breath\r\nto be held at his will or caprice. The necessity which should\r\noperate these tremendous effects should at least be palpable and\r\nirresistible. Yet in both instances, where it was feared, or pretended\r\nwith us, it was belied by the event. It was belied, too,\r\nby the preceding experience of our sister States, several of whom\r\nhad grappled through greater difficulties without abandoning\r\ntheir forms of government. When the proposition was first\r\nmade, Massachusetts had found even the government of committees\r\nsufficient to carry them through an invasion. But we at\r\nthe time of that proposition, were under no invasion. When the\r\nsecond was made, there had been added to this example those\r\nof Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania, in\r\nall of which the republican form had been found equal to the\r\ntask of carrying them through the severest trials. In this State\r\nalone did there exist so little virtue, that fear was to be fixed in\r\nthe hearts of the people, and to become the motive of their exertions,\r\nand principle of their government? The very thought\r\nalone was treason against the people; was treason against mankind\r\nin general; as rivetting forever the chains which bow down\r\ntheir necks, by giving to their oppressors a proof, which they\r\nwould have trumpeted through the universe, of the imbecility of\r\nrepublican government, in times of pressing danger, to shield\r\nthem from harm. Those who assume the right of giving away\r\nthe reins of government in any case, must be sure that the herd,\r\nwhom they hand on to the rods and hatchet of the dictator, will\r\nlay their necks on the block when he shall nod to them. But if\r\nour assemblies supposed such a recognition in the people, I hope\r\nthey mistook their character. I am of opinion, that the government,\r\ninstead of being braced and invigorated for greater exertions\r\nunder their difficulties, would have been thrown back upon\r\nthe bungling machinery of county committees for administration,\r\ntill a convention could have been called, and its wheels again\r\nset into regular motion. What a cruel moment was this for creating\r\nsuch an embarrassment, for putting to the proof the attachment\r\nof our countrymen to republican government! Those who\r\nmeant well, of the advocates of this measure, (and most of them\r\nmeant well, for I know them personally, had been their fellow-laborer\r\nin the common cause, and had often proved the purity\r\nof their principles,) had been seduced in their judgment by the\r\nexample of an ancient republic, whose constitution and circumstances\r\nwere fundamentally different. They had sought this\r\nprecedent in the history of Rome, where alone it was to be\r\nfound, and where at length, too, it had proved fatal. They had\r\ntaken it from a republic rent by the most bitter factions and tumults,\r\nwhere the government was of a heavy-handed unfeeling\r\naristocracy, over a people ferocious, and rendered desperate by\r\npoverty and wretchedness; tumults which could not be allayed\r\nunder the most trying circumstances, but by the omnipotent\r\nhand of a single despot. Their constitution, therefore, allowed\r\na temporary tyrant to be erected, under the name of a dictator;\r\nand that temporary tyrant, after a few examples, became perpetual.\r\nThey misapplied this precedent to a people mild in their\r\ndispositions, patient under their trial, united for the public liberty,\r\nand affectionate to their leaders. But if from the constitution of\r\nthe Roman government there resulted to their senate a power of\r\nsubmitting all their rights to the will of one man, does it follow\r\nthat the assembly of Virginia have the same authority? What\r\nclause in our constitution has substituted that of Rome, by way\r\nof residuary provision, for all cases not otherwise provided for?\r\nOr if they may step _ad libitum_ into any other form of government\r\nfor precedents to rule us by, for what oppression may not\r\na precedent be found in this world of the _ballum omnium in\r\nomnia_? Searching for the foundations of this proposition, I can\r\nfind none which may pretend a color of right or reason, but the\r\ndefect before developed, that there being no barrier between the\r\nlegislative, executive, and judiciary departments, the legislature\r\nmay seize the whole; that having seized it, and possessing a right\r\nto fix their own quorum, they may reduce that quorum to one,\r\nwhom they may call a chairman, speaker, dictator, or by any\r\nother name they please. Our situation is indeed perilous, and I\r\nhope my countrymen will be sensible of it, and will apply, at a\r\nproper season, the proper remedy; which is a convention to fix\r\nthe constitution, to amend its defects, to bind up the several\r\nbranches of government by certain laws, which, when they transgress,\r\ntheir acts shall become nullities; to render unnecessary an\r\nappeal to the people, or in other words a rebellion, on every infraction\r\nof their rights, on the peril that their acquiescence shall\r\nbe construed into an intention to surrender those rights.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [49] Art. 4.\r\n\r\n    [50] Art. 7.\r\n\r\n    [51] Art. 8.\r\n\r\n    [52] Art. 8.\r\n\r\n    [53] Of these 542 are on the eastern shore.\r\n\r\n    [54] Of these, 22,616 are eastward of the meridian of the north\r\n         of the Great Kanhaway.\r\n\r\n    [55] To bid, to set, was the ancient legislative word of the\r\n         English.

In every county are appointed\r\nmagistrates, called justices of the peace, usually from\r\neight to thirty or forty in number, in proportion to the size of\r\nthe county, of the most discreet and honest inhabitants. They\r\nare nominated by their fellows, but commissioned by the governor,\r\nand act without reward. These magistrates have jurisdiction\r\nboth criminal and civil. If the question before them be a\r\nquestion of law only, they decide on it themselves; but if it be\r\nof fact, or of fact and law combined, it must be referred to a\r\njury. In the latter case, of a combination of law and fact, it is\r\nusual for the jurors to decide the fact, and to refer the law arising\r\non it to the decision of the judges. But this division of the\r\nsubject lies with their discretion only. And if the question relate\r\nto any point of public liberty, or if it be one of those in\r\nwhich the judges may be suspected of bias, the jury undertake\r\nto decide both law and fact. If they be mistaken, a decision\r\nagainst right, which is casual only, is less dangerous to the State,\r\nand less afflicting to the loser, than one which makes part of a\r\nregular and uniform system. In truth, it is better to toss up cross\r\nand pile in a cause, than to refer it to a judge whose mind is\r\nwarped by any motive whatever, in that particular case. But\r\nthe common sense of twelve honest men gives still a better\r\nchance of just decision, than the hazard of cross and pile. These\r\njudges execute their process by the sheriff or coroner of the\r\ncounty, or by constables of their own appointment. If any free\r\nperson commit an offence against the commonwealth, if it be\r\nbelow the degree of felony, he is bound by a justice to appear\r\nbefore their court, to answer it on an indictment or information.\r\nIf it amount to felony, he is committed to jail; a court of these\r\njustices is called; if they on examination think him guilty, they\r\nsend him to the jail of the general court, before which court he\r\nis to be tried first by a grand jury of twenty-four, of whom\r\nthirteen must concur in opinion; if they find him guilty, he is\r\nthen tried by a jury of twelve men of the county where the offence\r\nwas committed, and by their verdict, which must be unanimous,\r\nhe is acquitted or condemned without appeal. If the\r\ncriminal be a slave, the trial by the county court is final. In\r\nevery case, however, except that of high treason, there resides\r\nin the governor a power of pardon. In high treason the pardon\r\ncan only flow from the general assembly. In civil matters these\r\njustices have jurisdiction in all cases of whatever value, not appertaining\r\nto the department of the admiralty. This jurisdiction\r\nis twofold. If the matter in dispute be of less value than four\r\ndollars and one-sixth, a single member may try it at any time\r\nand place within his county, and may award execution on the\r\ngoods of the party cast. If it be of that or greater value, it is\r\ndeterminable before the county court, which consists of four at\r\nthe least of those justices and assembles at the court-house of\r\nthe county on a certain day in every month. From their determination,\r\nif the matter be of the value of ten pounds sterling, or\r\nconcern the title or bounds of lands, an appeal lies to one of the\r\nsuperior courts.\r\n\r\nThere are three or four superior courts, to wit, the high court\r\nof chancery, the general court, and the court of admiralty. The\r\nfirst and second of these receive appeals from the county courts,\r\nand also have original jurisdiction, where the subject of controversy\r\nis of the value of ten pounds sterling, or where it concerns\r\nthe title or bounds of lands. The jurisdiction of the admiralty\r\nis original altogether. The high court of chancery is composed\r\nof three judges, the general court of five, and the court of admiralty\r\nof three. The two first hold their sessions at Richmond\r\nat stated times, the chancery twice in the year, and the general\r\ncourt twice for business civil and criminal, and twice more for\r\ncriminal only. The court of admiralty sits at Williamsburg\r\nwhenever a controversy arises.\r\n\r\nThere is one supreme court, called the court of appeals, composed\r\nof the judges of the three superior courts, assembling\r\ntwice a year at stated times at Richmond. This court receives\r\nappeals in all civil cases from each of the superior courts, and\r\ndetermines them finally. But it has no original jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIf a controversy arise between two foreigners of a nation in\r\nalliance with the United States, it is decided by the Consul for\r\ntheir State, or, if both parties choose it, by the ordinary courts\r\nof justice. If one of the parties only be such a foreigner, it is\r\ntriable before the courts of justice of the country. But if it\r\nshall have been instituted in a county court, the foreigner may\r\nremove it into the general court, or court of chancery, who are\r\nto determine it at their first sessions, as they must also do if it\r\nbe originally commenced before them. In cases of life and\r\ndeath, such foreigners have a right to be tried by a jury, the one-half\r\nforeigners, the other natives.\r\n\r\nAll public accounts are settled with a board of auditors, consisting\r\nof three members appointed by the general assembly, any\r\ntwo of whom may act. But an individual, dissatisfied with the\r\ndetermination of that board, may carry his case into the proper\r\nsuperior court.\r\n\r\nA description of the laws.\r\n\r\nThe general assembly was constituted, as has been already\r\nshown, by letters-patent of March the 9th, 1607, in the fourth\r\nyear of the reign of James the first. The laws of England\r\nseem to have been adopted by consent of the settlers, which\r\nmight easily enough be done whilst they were few and living\r\nall together. Of such adoption, however, we have no other\r\nproof than their practice till the year 1661, when they were expressly\r\nadopted by an act of the assembly, except so far as \"a\r\ndifference of condition\" rendered them inapplicable. Under this\r\nadoption, the rule, in our courts of judicature was, that the common\r\nlaw of England, and the general statutes previous to the\r\nfourth of James, were in force here; but that no subsequent\r\nstatutes were, _unless we were named in them_, said the judges\r\nand other partisans of the crown, but _named or not named_, said\r\nthose who reflected freely. It will be unnecessary to attempt a\r\ndescription of the laws of England, as that may be found in\r\nEnglish publications. To those which were established here,\r\nby the adoption of the legislature, have been since added a number\r\nof acts of assembly passed during the monarchy, and ordinances\r\nof convention and acts of assembly enacted since the establishment\r\nof the republic. The following variations from the\r\nBritish model are perhaps worthy of being specified:\r\n\r\nDebtors unable to pay their debts, and making faithful delivery\r\nof their whole effects, are released from confinement, and\r\ntheir persons forever discharged from restraint for such previous\r\ndebts; but any property they may afterwards acquire will be\r\nsubject to their creditors.\r\n\r\nThe poor unable to support themselves, are maintained by an\r\nassessment on the tytheable persons in their parish. This assessment\r\nis levied and administered by twelve persons in each parish,\r\ncalled vestrymen, originally chosen by the housekeepers of the\r\nparish, but afterwards filling vacancies in their own body by\r\ntheir own choice. These are usually the most discreet farmers,\r\nso distributed through their parish, that every part of it may be\r\nunder the immediate eye of some one of them. They are well\r\nacquainted with the details and economy of private life, and\r\nthey find sufficient inducements to execute their charge well, in\r\ntheir philanthropy, in the approbation of their neighbors, and the\r\ndistinction which that gives them. The poor who have neither\r\nproperty, friends, nor strength to labor, are boarded in the houses\r\nof good farmers, to whom a stipulated sum is annually paid. To\r\nthose who are able to help themselves a little, or have friends\r\nfrom whom they derive some succors, inadequate however to\r\ntheir full maintenance, supplementary aids are given which enable\r\nthem to live comfortably in their own houses, or in the\r\nhouses of their friends. Vagabonds without visible property or\r\nvocation, are placed in work houses, where they are well clothed,\r\nfed, lodged, and made to labor. Nearly the same method of\r\nproviding for the poor prevails through all our States; and from\r\nSavannah to Portsmouth you will seldom meet a beggar. In\r\nthe large towns, indeed, they sometimes present themselves.\r\nThese are usually foreigners, who have never obtained a settlement\r\nin any parish. I never yet saw a native American begging\r\nin the streets or highways. A subsistence is easily gained here;\r\nand if, by misfortunes, they are thrown on the charities of the\r\nworld, those provided by their own country are so comfortable\r\nand so certain, that they never think of relinquishing them to become\r\nstrolling beggars. Their situation too, when sick, in the\r\nfamily of a good farmer, where every member is emulous to do\r\nthem kind offices, where they are visited by all the neighbors,\r\nwho bring them the little rarities which their sickly appetites\r\nmay crave, and who take by rotation the nightly watch over\r\nthem, when their condition requires it, is without comparison\r\nbetter than in a general hospital, where the sick, the dying and\r\nthe dead are crammed together in the same rooms, and often in\r\nthe same beds. The disadvantages, inseparable from general\r\nhospitals, are such as can never be counterpoised by all the regularities\r\nof medicine and regimen. Nature and kind nursing save\r\na much greater proportion in our plain way, at a smaller expense,\r\nand with less abuse. One branch only of hospital institution is\r\nwanting with us; that is, a general establishment for those laboring\r\nunder difficult cases of chirurgery. The aids of this art are\r\nnot equivocal. But an able chirurgeon cannot be had in every\r\nparish. Such a receptacle should therefore be provided for those\r\npatients; but no others should be admitted.\r\n\r\nMarriages must be solemnized either on special license, granted\r\nby the first magistrate of the county, on proof of the consent\r\nof the parent or guardian of either party under age, or after\r\nsolemn publication, on three several Sundays, at some place of\r\nreligious worship, in the parishes where the parties reside. The\r\nact of solemnization may be by the minister of any society of\r\nChristians, who shall have been previously licensed for this purpose\r\nby the court of the county. Quakers and Menonists, however,\r\nare exempted from all these conditions, and marriage among\r\nthem is to be solemnized by the society itself.\r\n\r\nA foreigner of any nation, not in open war with us, becomes\r\nnaturalized by removing to the State to reside, and taking an\r\noath of fidelity; and thereupon acquires every right of a native\r\ncitizen; and citizens may divest themselves of that character,\r\nby declaring, by solemn deed, or in open court, that they mean\r\nto expatriate themselves, and no longer to be citizens of this State.\r\n\r\nConveyances of land must be registered in the court of the\r\ncounty wherein they lie, or in the general court, or they are void,\r\nas to creditors, and subsequent purchasers.\r\n\r\nSlaves pass by descent and dower as lands do. Where the\r\ndescent is from a parent, the heir is bound to pay an equal\r\nshare of their value in money to each of their brothers and sisters.\r\n\r\nSlaves, as well as lands, were entailable during the monarchy;\r\nbut, by an act of the first republican assembly, all donees in tail,\r\npresent and future, were vested with the absolute dominion of\r\nthe entailed subject.\r\n\r\nBills of exchange, being protested, carry ten per cent. interest\r\nfrom their date.\r\n\r\nNo person is allowed, in any other case, to take more than\r\nfive per cent. per annum simple interest for the loan of moneys.\r\n\r\nGaming debts are made void, and moneys actually paid to\r\ndischarge such debts (if they exceed forty shillings) may be recovered\r\nby the payer within three months, or by any other person\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nTobacco, flour, beef, pork, tar, pitch, and turpentine, must be\r\ninspected by persons publicly appointed, before they can be exported.\r\n\r\nThe erecting iron-works and mills is encouraged by many\r\nprivileges; with necessary cautions however to prevent their\r\ndams from obstructing the navigation of the water-courses. The\r\ngeneral assembly have on several occasions shown a great desire\r\nto encourage the opening the great falls of James and Potomac\r\nrivers. As yet, however, neither of these have been effected.\r\n\r\nThe laws have also descended to the preservation and improvement\r\nof the races of useful animals, such as horses, cattle,\r\ndeer; to the extirpation of those which are noxious, as wolves,\r\nsquirrels, crows, blackbirds; and to the guarding our citizens\r\nagainst infectious disorders, by obliging suspected vessels coming\r\ninto the State, to perform quarantine, and by regulating the conduct\r\nof persons having such disorders within the State.\r\n\r\nThe mode of acquiring lands, in the earliest times of our settlement,\r\nwas by petition to the general assembly. If the lands\r\nprayed for were already cleared of the Indian title, and the assembly\r\nthought the prayer reasonable, they passed the property\r\nby their vote to the petitioner. But if they had not yet been\r\nceded by the Indians, it was necessary that the petitioner should\r\npreviously purchase their right. This purchase the assembly\r\nverified, by inquiries of the Indian proprietors; and being satisfied\r\nof its reality and fairness, proceeded further to examine the\r\nreasonableness of the petition, and its consistence with policy;\r\nand according to the result, either granted or rejected the petition.\r\nThe company also sometimes, though very rarely, granted\r\nlands, independently of the general assembly. As the colony\r\nincreased, and individual applications for land multiplied, it was\r\nfound to give too much occupation to the general assembly to\r\ninquire into and execute the grant in every special case. They\r\ntherefore thought it better to establish general rules, according to\r\nwhich all grants should be made, and to leave to the governor\r\nthe execution of them, under these rules. This they did by\r\nwhat have been usually called the land laws, amending them\r\nfrom time to time, as their defects were developed. According\r\nto these laws, when an individual wished a portion of unappropriated\r\nland, he was to locate and survey it by a public officer,\r\nappointed for that purpose; its breadth was to bear a certain proportion\r\nto its length: the grant was to be executed by the governor;\r\nand the lands were to be improved in a certain manner,\r\nwithin a given time. From these regulations there resulted to\r\nthe State a sole and exclusive power of taking conveyances of\r\nthe Indian right of soil; since, according to them an Indian conveyance\r\nalone could give no right to an individual, which the\r\nlaws would acknowledge. The State, or the crown, thereafter,\r\nmade general purchases of the Indians from time to time, and\r\nthe governor parcelled them out by special grants, conformable\r\nto the rules before described, which it was not in his power, or\r\nin that of the crown, to dispense with. Grants, unaccompanied\r\nby their proper legal circumstances, were set aside regularly by\r\n_fiere facias_, or by bill in chancery. Since the establishment\r\nof our new government, this order of things is but little changed.\r\nAn individual, wishing to appropriate to himself lands still unappropriated\r\nby any other, pays to the public treasurer a sum of\r\nmoney proportioned to the quantity he wants. He carries the\r\ntreasurer's receipt to the auditors of public accounts, who thereupon\r\ndebit the treasurer with the sum, and order the register of\r\nthe land-office to give the party a warrant for his land. With\r\nthis warrant from the register, he goes to the surveyor of the\r\ncounty where the land lies on which he has cast his eye. The\r\nsurveyor lays it off for him, gives him its exact description, in\r\nthe form of a certificate, which certificate he returns to the land\r\noffice, where a grant is made out, and is signed by the governor.\r\nThis vests in him a perfect dominion in his lands, transmissible\r\nto whom he pleases by deed or will, or by descent to his heirs,\r\nif he die intestate.\r\n\r\nMany of the laws which were in force during the monarchy\r\nbeing relative merely to that form of government, or inculcating\r\nprinciples inconsistent with republicanism, the first assembly\r\nwhich met after the establishment of the commonwealth appointed\r\na committee to revise the whole code, to reduce it into\r\nproper form and volume, and report it to the assembly. This\r\nwork has been executed by three gentlemen, and reported; but\r\nprobably will not be taken up till a restoration of peace shall\r\nleave to the legislature leisure to go through such a work.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the revisal was this. The common law of England,\r\nby which is meant, that part of the English law which\r\nwas anterior to the date of the oldest statutes extant, is made the\r\nbasis of the work. It was thought dangerous to attempt to reduce\r\nit to a text; it was therefore left to be collected from the\r\nusual monuments of it. Necessary alterations in that, and so\r\nmuch of the whole body of the British statutes, and of acts of\r\nassembly, as were thought proper to be retained, were digested\r\ninto one hundred and twenty-six new acts, in which simplicity\r\nof style was aimed at, as far as was safe. The following are the\r\nmost remarkable alterations proposed:\r\n\r\nTo change the rules of descent, so as that the lands of any\r\nperson dying intestate shall be divisible equally among all his\r\nchildren, or other representatives, in equal degree.\r\n\r\nTo make slaves distributable among the next of kin, as other\r\nmovables.\r\n\r\nTo have all public expenses, whether of the general treasury,\r\nor of a parish or county, (as for the maintenance of the poor,\r\nbuilding bridges, court-houses, &c.,) supplied by assessment on\r\nthe citizens, in proportion to their property.\r\n\r\nTo hire undertakers for keeping the public roads in repair,\r\nand indemnify individuals through whose lands new roads shall\r\nbe opened.\r\n\r\nTo define with precision the rules whereby aliens should become\r\ncitizens, and citizens make themselves aliens.\r\n\r\nTo establish religious freedom on the broadest bottom.\r\n\r\nTo emancipate all slaves born after passing the act. The\r\nbill reported by the revisers does not itself contain this proposition;\r\nbut an amendment containing it was prepared, to be\r\noffered to the legislature whenever the bill should be taken\r\nup, and farther directing, that they should continue with their\r\nparents to a certain age, then to be brought up, at the public expense,\r\nto tillage, arts, or sciences, according to their geniuses, till\r\nthe females should be eighteen, and the males twenty-one years\r\nof age, when they should be colonized to such place as the circumstances\r\nof the time should render most proper, sending them\r\nout with arms, implements of household and of the handicraft\r\narts, seeds, pairs of the useful domestic animals, &c., to declare\r\nthem a free and independent people, and extend to them our alliance\r\nand protection, till they have acquired strength; and to\r\nsend vessels at the same time to other parts of the world for an\r\nequal number of white inhabitants; to induce them to migrate\r\nhither, proper encouragements were to be proposed. It will probably\r\nbe asked, Why not retain and incorporate the blacks into\r\nthe State, and thus save the expense of supplying by importation\r\nof white settlers, the vacancies they will leave? Deep-rooted\r\nprejudices entertained by the whites; ten thousand recollections,\r\nby the blacks, of the injuries they have sustained; new provocations;\r\nthe real distinctions which nature has made; and many\r\nother circumstances, will divide us into parties, and produce convulsions,\r\nwhich will probably never end but in the extermination\r\nof the one or the other race. To these objections, which are\r\npolitical, may be added others, which are physical and moral.\r\nThe first difference which strikes us is that of color. Whether\r\nthe black of the negro resides in the reticular membrane between\r\nthe skin and scarf-skin, or in the scarf-skin itself; whether it\r\nproceeds from the color of the blood, the color of the bile, or\r\nfrom that of some other secretion, the difference is fixed in nature,\r\nand is as real as if its seat and cause were better known to\r\nus. And is this difference of no importance? Is it not the\r\nfoundation of a greater or less share of beauty in the two races?\r\nAre not the fine mixtures of red and white, the expressions of\r\nevery passion by greater or less suffusions of color in the one,\r\npreferable to that eternal monotony, which reigns in the countenances,\r\nthat immovable veil of black which covers the emotions\r\nof the other race? Add to these, flowing hair, a more elegant\r\nsymmetry of form, their own judgment in favor of the whites,\r\ndeclared by their preference of them, as uniformly as is the preference\r\nof the Oranootan for the black woman over those of his\r\nown species. The circumstance of superior beauty, is thought\r\nworthy attention in the propagation of our horses, dogs, and\r\nother domestic animals; why not in that of man? Besides those\r\nof color, figure, and hair, there are other physical distinctions\r\nproving a difference of race. They have less hair on the face\r\nand body. They secrete less by the kidneys, and more by the\r\nglands of the skin, which gives them a very strong and disagreeable\r\nodor. This greater degree of transpiration, renders them\r\nmore tolerant of heat, and less so of cold than the whites. Perhaps,\r\ntoo, a difference of structure in the pulminary apparatus,\r\nwhich a late ingenious[59] experimentalist has discovered to be the\r\nprincipal regulator of animal heat, may have disabled them from\r\nextricating, in the act of inspiration, so much of that fluid from\r\nthe outer air, or obliged them in expiration, to part with more of\r\nit. They seem to require less sleep. A black after hard labor\r\nthrough the day, will be induced by the slightest amusements\r\nto sit up till midnight, or later, though knowing he must be out\r\nwith the first dawn of the morning. They are at least as brave,\r\nand more adventuresome. But this may perhaps proceed from a\r\nwant of forethought, which prevents their seeing a danger till it\r\nbe present. When present, they do not go through it with more\r\ncoolness or steadiness than the whites. They are more ardent\r\nafter their female; but love seems with them to be more an eager\r\ndesire, than a tender delicate mixture of sentiment and sensation.\r\nTheir griefs are transient. Those numberless afflictions, which\r\nrender it doubtful whether heaven has given life to us in mercy\r\nor in wrath, are less felt, and sooner forgotten with them. In\r\ngeneral, their existence appears to participate more of sensation\r\nthan reflection. To this must be ascribed their disposition to\r\nsleep when abstracted from their diversions, and unemployed in\r\nlabor. An animal whose body is at rest, and who does not reflect,\r\nmust be disposed to sleep of course. Comparing them\r\nby their faculties of memory, reason, and imagination, it appears\r\nto me that in memory they are equal to the whites; in reason\r\nmuch inferior, as I think one could scarcely be found capable of\r\ntracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid; and\r\nthat in imagination they are dull, tasteless, and anomalous. It\r\nwould be unfair to follow them to Africa for this investigation.\r\nWe will consider them here, on the same stage with the whites,\r\nand where the facts are not apochryphal on which a judgment\r\nis to be formed. It will be right to make great allowances for\r\nthe difference of condition, of education, of conversation, of the\r\nsphere in which they move. Many millions of them have been\r\nbrought to, and born in America. Most of them, indeed, have\r\nbeen confined to tillage, to their own homes, and their own society;\r\nyet many have been so situated, that they might have\r\navailed themselves of the conversation of their masters; many\r\nhave been brought up to the handicraft arts, and from that circumstance\r\nhave always been associated with the whites. Some\r\nhave been liberally educated, and all have lived in countries\r\nwhere the arts and sciences are cultivated to a considerable degree,\r\nand all have had before their eyes samples of the best\r\nworks from abroad. The Indians, with no advantages of this\r\nkind, will often carve figures on their pipes not destitute of design\r\nand merit. They will crayon out an animal, a plant, or a\r\ncountry, so as to prove the existence of a germ in their minds\r\nwhich only wants cultivation. They astonish you with strokes\r\nof the most sublime oratory; such as prove their reason and sentiment\r\nstrong, their imagination glowing and elevated. But\r\nnever yet could I find that a black had uttered a thought above\r\nthe level of plain narration; never saw even an elementary trait\r\nof painting or sculpture. In music they are more generally gifted\r\nthan the whites with accurate ears for tune and time, and they\r\nhave been found capable of imagining a small catch.[60] Whether\r\nthey will be equal to the composition of a more extensive run\r\nof melody, or of complicated harmony, is yet to be proved.\r\nMisery is often the parent of the most affecting touches in\r\npoetry. Among the blacks is misery enough, God knows, but\r\nno poetry. Love is the peculiar œstrum of the poet. Their\r\nlove is ardent, but it kindles the senses only, not the imagination.\r\nReligion, indeed, has produced a Phyllis Whately; but it\r\ncould not produce a poet. The compositions published under\r\nher name are below the dignity of criticism. The heroes of\r\nthe Dunciad are to her, as Hercules to the author of that\r\npoem. Ignatius Sancho has approached nearer to merit in composition;\r\nyet his letters do more honor to the heart than the\r\nhead. They breathe the purest effusions of friendship and\r\ngeneral philanthropy, and show how great a degree of the latter\r\nmay be compounded with strong religious zeal. He is often\r\nhappy in the turn of his compliments, and his style is easy and\r\nfamiliar, except when he affects a Shandean fabrication of words.\r\nBut his imagination is wild and extravagant, escapes incessantly\r\nfrom every restraint of reason and taste, and, in the course of\r\nits vagaries, leaves a tract of thought as incoherent and eccentric,\r\nas is the course of a meteor through the sky. His subjects\r\nshould often have led him to a process of sober reasoning; yet\r\nwe find him always substituting sentiment for demonstration.\r\nUpon the whole, though we admit him to the first place among\r\nthose of his own color who have presented themselves to the\r\npublic judgment, yet when we compare him with the writers of\r\nthe race among whom he lived and particularly with the epistolary\r\nclass in which he has taken his own stand, we are compelled\r\nto enrol him at the bottom of the column. This criticism supposes\r\nthe letters published under his name to be genuine, and to\r\nhave received amendment from no other hand; points which\r\nwould not be of easy investigation. The improvement of the\r\nblacks in body and mind, in the first instance of their mixture\r\nwith the whites, has been observed by every one, and proves\r\nthat their inferiority is not the effect merely of their condition\r\nof life. We know that among the Romans, about the Augustan\r\nage especially, the condition of their slaves was much more deplorable\r\nthan that of the blacks on the continent of America. The\r\ntwo sexes were confined in separate apartments, because to raise a\r\nchild cost the master more than to buy one. Cato, for a very restricted\r\nindulgence to his slaves in this particular[61], took from them\r\na certain price. But in this country the slaves multiply as fast as\r\nthe free inhabitants. Their situation and manners place the\r\ncommerce between the two sexes almost without restraint. The\r\nsame Cato, on a principle of economy, always sold his sick and\r\nsuperannuated slaves. He gives it as a standing precept to a\r\nmaster visiting his farm, to sell his old oxen, old wagons, old\r\ntools, old and diseased servants, and everything else become useless.\r\n\"Vendat boves vetulos, plaustrum vetus, feramenta vetera,\r\nservum senem, servum morbosum, et si quid aliud supersit vendat.\"\r\nCato de re rusticâ, c. 2. The American slaves cannot\r\nenumerate this among the injuries and insults they receive. It\r\nwas the common practice to expose in the island Æsculapius, in\r\nthe Tyber, diseased slaves whose cure was like to become\r\ntedious.[62] The emperor Claudius, by an edict, gave freedom to\r\nsuch of them as should recover, and first declared that if any\r\nperson chose to kill rather than to expose them, it should not be\r\ndeemed homicide. The exposing them is a crime of which no\r\ninstance has existed with us; and were it to be followed by\r\ndeath, it would be punished capitally. We are told of a certain\r\nVedius Pollio, who, in the presence of Augustus, would have\r\ngiven a slave as food to his fish, for having broken a glass. With\r\nthe Romans, the regular method of taking the evidence of their\r\nslaves was under torture. Here it has been thought better never\r\nto resort to their evidence. When a master was murdered, all\r\nhis slaves, in the same house, or within hearing, were condemned\r\nto death. Here punishment falls on the guilty only,\r\nand as precise proof is required against him as against a freeman.\r\nYet notwithstanding these and other discouraging circumstances\r\namong the Romans, their slaves were often their rarest artists.\r\nThey excelled too in science, insomuch as to be usually employed\r\nas tutors to their master's children. Epictetus, Terence,\r\nand Phædrus, were slaves. But they were of the race of whites.\r\nIt is not their condition then, but nature, which has produced the\r\ndistinction. Whether further observation will or will not verify\r\nthe conjecture, that nature has been less bountiful to them in\r\nthe endowments of the head, I believe that in those of the heart\r\nshe will be found to have done them justice. That disposition\r\nto theft with which they have been branded, must be ascribed\r\nto their situation, and not to any depravity of the moral sense.\r\nThe man in whose favor no laws of property exist, probably\r\nfeels himself less bound to respect those made in favor of others.\r\nWhen arguing for ourselves, we lay it down as a fundamental,\r\nthat laws, to be just, must give a reciprocation of right; that,\r\nwithout this, they are mere arbitrary rules of conduct, founded\r\nin force, and not in conscience; and it is a problem which I\r\ngive to the master to solve, whether the religious precepts against\r\nthe violation of property were not framed for him as well as his\r\nslave? And whether the slave may not as justifiably take a\r\nlittle from one who has taken all from him, as he may slay one\r\nwho would slay him? That a change in the relations in which\r\na man is placed should change his ideas of moral right or wrong,\r\nis neither new, nor peculiar to the color of the blacks. Homer\r\ntells us it was so two thousand six hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n     'Emisu, ger t' aretes apoainutai euruopa Zeus\r\n     Haneros, eut' an min kata doulion ema elesin.\r\n\r\n                                     Odd. 17, 323.\r\n\r\n     Jove fix'd it certain, that whatever day\r\n     Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away.\r\n\r\nBut the slaves of which Homer speaks were whites. Notwithstanding\r\nthese considerations which must weaken their respect\r\nfor the laws of property, we find among them numerous\r\ninstances of the most rigid integrity, and as many as among\r\ntheir better instructed masters, of benevolence, gratitude, and unshaken\r\nfidelity. The opinion that they are inferior in the faculties\r\nof reason and imagination, must be hazarded with great\r\ndiffidence. To justify a general conclusion, requires many observations,\r\neven where the subject may be submitted to the anatomical\r\nknife, to optical glasses, to analysis by fire or by solvents.\r\nHow much more then where it is a faculty, not a substance, we\r\nare examining; where it eludes the research of all the senses;\r\nwhere the conditions of its existence are various and variously\r\ncombined; where the effects of those which are present or absent\r\nbid defiance to calculation; let me add too, as a circumstance\r\nof great tenderness, where our conclusion would degrade\r\na whole race of men from the rank in the scale of beings which\r\ntheir Creator may perhaps have given them. To our reproach it\r\nmust be said, that though for a century and a half we have had\r\nunder our eyes the races of black and of red men, they have\r\nnever yet been viewed by us as subjects of natural history. I\r\nadvance it, therefore, as a suspicion only, that the blacks, whether\r\noriginally a distinct race, or made distinct by time and circumstances,\r\nare inferior to the whites in the endowments both\r\nof body and mind. It is not against experience to suppose that\r\ndifferent species of the same genus, or varieties of the same species,\r\nmay possess different qualifications. Will not a lover of\r\nnatural history then, one who views the gradations in all the\r\nraces of animals with the eye of philosophy, excuse an effort to\r\nkeep those in the department of man as distinct as nature has\r\nformed them? This unfortunate difference of color, and perhaps\r\nof faculty, is a powerful obstacle to the emancipation of\r\nthese people. Many of their advocates, while they wish to vindicate\r\nthe liberty of human nature, are anxious also to preserve\r\nits dignity and beauty. Some of these, embarrassed by the question,\r\n\"What further is to be done with them?\" join themselves\r\nin opposition with those who are actuated by sordid avarice only.\r\nAmong the Romans emancipation required but one effort. The\r\nslave, when made free, might mix with, without staining the\r\nblood of his master. But with us a second is necessary, unknown\r\nto history. When freed, he is to be removed beyond the\r\nreach of mixture.\r\n\r\nThe revised code further proposes to proportion crimes and\r\npunishments. This is attempted on the following scale:\r\n\r\n  I. Crimes whose punishment extends to LIFE.\r\n\r\n    1. High treason.  Death by hanging.\r\n                      Forfeiture of lands and goods to the\r\n                        commonwealth.\r\n    2. Petty treason. Death by hanging. Dissection.\r\n                      Forfeiture of half the lands and goods to the\r\n                        representatives of the party slain.\r\n    3. Murder.  1. By poison. Death by poison.\r\n                              Forfeiture of one-half, as before.\r\n                2. In duel.   Death by hanging. Gibbeting, if the\r\n                                challenger.\r\n                              Forfeiture of one-half as before, unless\r\n                                it be the party challenged, then the\r\n                                forfeiture is to the commonwealth.\r\n                3. In any other way. Death by hanging.\r\n                               Forfeiture of one-half as before.\r\n    4. Manslaughter. The second offence is murder.\r\n\r\n  II. Crimes whose punishment goes to LIMB.\r\n\r\n    1. Rape.        } Dismemberment.\r\n    2. Sodomy.      }\r\n    3. Maiming.     } Retaliation, and the forfeiture of half of the\r\n    4. Disfiguring. }    lands and goods to the sufferer.\r\n\r\n  III. Crimes punishable by LABOR.\r\n\r\n    1. Manslaughter,      Labor VII. years    Forfeiture of half, as\r\n         1st offence.                for the    in murder.\r\n                                     public.\r\n    2.

Heresy.          }\r\n\r\nPardon and privilege of clergy are proposed to be abolished;\r\nbut if the verdict be against the defendant, the court in their\r\ndiscretion may allow a new trial. No attainder to cause a corruption\r\nof blood, or forfeiture of dower. Slaves guilty of offences\r\npunishable in others by labor, to be transported to Africa,\r\nor elsewhere, as the circumstances of the time admit, there to\r\nbe continued in slavery. A rigorous regimen proposed for those\r\ncondemned to labor.\r\n\r\nAnother object of the revisal is, to diffuse knowledge more\r\ngenerally through the mass of the people. This bill proposes to\r\nlay off every county into small districts of five or six miles square,\r\ncalled hundreds, and in each of them to establish a school for\r\nteaching, reading, writing, and arithmetic. The tutor to be supported\r\nby the hundred, and every person in it entitled to send\r\ntheir children three years gratis, and as much longer as they\r\nplease, paying for it. These schools to be under a visitor who\r\nis annually to choose the boy of best genius in the school, of\r\nthose whose parents are too poor to give them further education,\r\nand to send him forward to one of the grammar schools, of which\r\ntwenty are proposed to be erected in different parts of the country,\r\nfor teaching Greek, Latin, Geography, and the higher\r\nbranches of numerical arithmetic. Of the boys thus sent in\r\none year, trial is to be made at the grammar schools one or two\r\nyears, and the best genius of the whole selected, and continued\r\nsix years, and the residue dismissed. By this means twenty of\r\nthe best geniuses will be raked from the rubbish annually, and\r\nbe instructed, at the public expense, so far as the grammar schools\r\ngo. At the end of six years instruction, one half are to be discontinued\r\n(from among whom the grammar schools will probably\r\nbe supplied with future masters); and the other half, who\r\nare to be chosen for the superiority of their parts and disposition,\r\nare to be sent and continued three years in the study of such\r\nsciences as they shall choose, at William and Mary college, the\r\nplan of which is proposed to be enlarged, as will be hereafter\r\nexplained, and extended to all the useful sciences. The ultimate\r\nresult of the whole scheme of education would be the\r\nteaching all the children of the State reading, writing, and common\r\narithmetic; turning out ten annually, of superior genius,\r\nwell taught in Greek, Latin, Geography, and the higher branches\r\nof arithmetic; turning out ten others annually, of still superior\r\nparts, who, to those branches of learning, shall have added such\r\nof the sciences as their genius shall have led them to; the furnishing\r\nto the wealthier part of the people convenient schools at\r\nwhich their children may be educated at their own expense.\r\nThe general objects of this law are to provide an education\r\nadapted to the years, to the capacity, and the condition of every\r\none, and directed to their freedom and happiness. Specific details\r\nwere not proper for the law. These must be the business\r\nof the visitors entrusted with its execution. The first stage of\r\nthis education being the schools of the hundreds, wherein the\r\ngreat mass of the people will receive their instruction, the principal\r\nfoundations of future order will be laid here. Instead,\r\ntherefore, of putting the Bible and Testament into the hands of\r\nthe children at an age when their judgments are not sufficiently\r\nmatured for religious inquiries, their memories may here be stored\r\nwith the most useful facts from Grecian, Roman, European and\r\nAmerican history. The first elements of morality too may be\r\ninstilled into their minds; such as, when further developed as\r\ntheir judgments advance in strength, may teach them how to\r\nwork out their own greatest happiness, by showing them that it\r\ndoes not depend on the condition of life in which chance has\r\nplaced them, but is always the result of a good conscience, good\r\nhealth, occupation, and freedom in all just pursuits. Those\r\nwhom either the wealth of their parents or the adoption of the\r\nState shall destine to higher degrees of learning, will go on to\r\nthe grammar schools, which constitute the next stage, there to\r\nbe instructed in the languages. The learning Greek and Latin,\r\nI am told, is going into disuse in Europe. I know not what\r\ntheir manners and occupations may call for; but it would be\r\nvery ill-judged in us to follow their example in this instance.\r\nThere is a certain period of life, say from eight to fifteen or sixteen\r\nyears of age, when the mind like the body is not yet firm\r\nenough for laborious and close operations. If applied to such, it\r\nfalls an early victim to premature exertion; exhibiting, indeed,\r\nat first, in these young and tender subjects, the flattering appearance\r\nof their being men while they are yet children, but ending\r\nin reducing them to be children when they should be men.\r\nThe memory is then most susceptible and tenacious of impressions;\r\nand the learning of languages being chiefly a work of\r\nmemory, it seems precisely fitted to the powers of this period,\r\nwhich is long enough too for acquiring the most useful languages,\r\nancient and modern. I do not pretend that language is science.\r\nIt is only an instrument for the attainment of science. But that\r\ntime is not lost which is employed in providing tools for future\r\noperation; more especially as in this case the books put into the\r\nhands of the youth for this purpose may be such as will at the\r\nsame time impress their minds with useful facts and good principles.\r\nIf this period be suffered to pass in idleness, the mind\r\nbecomes lethargic and impotent, as would the body it inhabits\r\nif unexercised during the same time. The sympathy between\r\nbody and mind during their rise, progress and decline, is too strict\r\nand obvious to endanger our being missed while we reason from\r\nthe one to the other. As soon as they are of sufficient age, it is\r\nsupposed they will be sent on from the grammar schools to the\r\nuniversity, which constitutes our third and last stage, there to\r\nstudy those sciences which may be adapted to their views. By\r\nthat part of our plan which prescribes the selection of the youths\r\nof genius from among the classes of the poor, we hope to avail\r\nthe State of those talents which nature has sown as liberally\r\namong the poor as the rich, but which perish without use, if not\r\nsought for and cultivated. But of the views of this law none is\r\nmore important, none more legitimate, than that of rendering the\r\npeople the safe, as they are the ultimate, guardians of their own\r\nliberty. For this purpose the reading in the first stage, where\r\n_they_ will receive their whole education, is proposed, as has been\r\nsaid, to be chiefly historical. History, by apprizing them of the\r\npast, will enable them to judge of the future; it will avail them\r\nof the experience of other times and other nations; it will qualify\r\nthem as judges of the actions and designs of men; it will enable\r\nthem to know ambition under every disguise it may assume; and\r\nknowing it, to defeat its views. In every government on earth\r\nis some trace of human weakness, some germ of corruption and\r\ndegeneracy, which cunning will discover, and wickedness insensibly\r\nopen, cultivate and improve. Every government degenerates\r\nwhen trusted to the rulers of the people alone. The\r\npeople themselves therefore are its only safe depositories. And\r\nto render even them safe, their minds must be improved to a\r\ncertain degree. This indeed is not all that is necessary, though\r\nit be essentially necessary. An amendment of our constitution\r\nmust here come in aid of the public education. The influence\r\nover government must be shared among all the people. If every\r\nindividual which composes their mass participates of the ultimate\r\nauthority, the government will be safe; because the corrupting\r\nthe whole mass will exceed any private resources of wealth;\r\nand public ones cannot be provided but by levies on the people.\r\nIn this case every man would have to pay his own price. The\r\ngovernment of Great Britain has been corrupted, because but one\r\nman in ten has a right to vote for members of parliament. The\r\nsellers of the government, therefore, get nine-tenths of their price\r\nclear. It has been thought that corruption is restrained by confining\r\nthe right of suffrage to a few of the wealthier of the people;\r\nbut it would be more effectually restrained by an extension\r\nof that right to such numbers as would bid defiance to the means\r\nof corruption.\r\n\r\nLastly, it is proposed, by a bill in this revisal, to begin a public\r\nlibrary and gallery, by laying out a certain sum annually in\r\nbooks, paintings, and statues.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [59] Crawford.\r\n\r\n    [60] The instrument proper to them is the Banjar, which they\r\n         brought hither from Africa, and which is the original\r\n         of the guitar, its chords being precisely the four lower\r\n         chords of the guitar.\r\n\r\n    [61] Tous doulous etaxen örismenou nomesmatos homilein tais\r\n         therapainsin.--Plutarch.

It was founded in the time of king\r\nWilliam and queen Mary, who granted to it twenty thousand\r\nacres of land, and a penny a pound duty on certain tobaccoes\r\nexported from Virginia and Maryland, which had been levied by\r\nthe statute of 25 Car. II. The assembly also gave it, by temporary\r\nlaws, a duty on liquors imported, and skins and furs exported.\r\nFrom these resources it received upwards of three\r\nthousand pounds _communibus annis_. The buildings are of\r\nbrick, sufficient for an indifferent accommodation of perhaps an\r\nhundred students. By its charter it was to be under the government\r\nof twenty visitors, who were to be its legislators, and to\r\nhave a president and six professors, who were incorporated. It\r\nwas allowed a representative in the general assembly. Under\r\nthis charter, a professorship of the Greek and Latin languages, a\r\nprofessorship of mathematics, one of moral philosophy, and two\r\nof divinity, were established. To these were annexed, for a\r\nsixth professorship, a considerable donation by Mr. Boyle, of\r\nEngland, for the instruction of the Indians, and their conversion\r\nto Christianity. This was called the professorship of Brafferton,\r\nfrom an estate of that name in England, purchased with the\r\nmonies given. The admission of the learners of Latin and\r\nGreek filled the college with children. This rendering it disagreeable\r\nand degrading to young gentlemen already prepared for\r\nentering on the sciences, they were discouraged from resorting\r\nto it, and thus the schools for mathematics and moral philosophy,\r\nwhich might have been of some service, became of very little.\r\nThe revenues, too, were exhausted in accommodating those who\r\ncame only to acquire the rudiments of science. After the present\r\nrevolution, the visitors, having no power to change those circumstances\r\nin the constitution of the college which were fixed\r\nby the charter, and being therefore confined in the number of\r\nthe professorships, undertook to change the objects of the professorships.\r\nThey excluded the two schools for divinity, and that\r\nfor the Greek and Latin languages, and substituted others; so\r\nthat at present they stand thus:\r\n\r\n     A Professorship for Law and Police;\r\n       Anatomy and Medicine;\r\n       Natural Philosophy and Mathematics;\r\n       Moral Philosophy, the Law of Nature and Nations, the Fine Arts;\r\n       Modern Languages;\r\n       For the Brafferton.\r\n\r\nAnd it is proposed, so soon as the legislature shall have leisure\r\nto take up this subject, to desire authority from them to increase\r\nthe number of professorships, as well for the purpose of subdividing\r\nthose already instituted, as of adding others for other\r\nbranches of science. To the professorships usually established in\r\nthe universities of Europe, it would seem proper to add one for the\r\nancient languages and literature of the north, on account of their\r\nconnection with our own language, laws, customs, and history.\r\nThe purposes of the Brafferton institution would be better answered\r\nby maintaining a perpetual mission among the Indian\r\ntribes, the object of which, besides instructing them in the principles\r\nof Christianity, as the founder requires, should be to collect\r\ntheir traditions, laws, customs, languages, and other circumstances\r\nwhich might lead to a discovery of their relation with one another,\r\nor descent from other nations. When these objects are\r\naccomplished with one tribe, the missionary might pass on to another.\r\n\r\nThe roads are under the government of the county courts,\r\nsubject to be controlled by the general court. They order new\r\nroads to be opened wherever they think them necessary. The\r\ninhabitants of the county are by them laid off into precincts, to\r\neach of which they allot a convenient portion of the public roads\r\nto be kept in repair. Such bridges as may be built without the\r\nassistance of artificers, they are to build. If the stream be such\r\nas to require a bridge of regular workmanship, the court employs\r\nworkmen to build it, at the expense of the whole county. If it\r\nbe too great for the county, application is made to the general\r\nassembly, who authorize individuals to build it, and to take a\r\nfixed toll from all passengers, or give sanction to such other proposition\r\nas to them appears reasonable.\r\n\r\nFerries are admitted only at such places as are particularly\r\npointed out by law, and the rates of ferriage are fixed.\r\n\r\nTaverns are licensed by the courts, who fix their rates from\r\ntime to time.\r\n\r\nThe private buildings are very rarely constructed of stone or\r\nbrick, much the greatest portion being of scantling and boards,\r\nplastered with lime. It is impossible to devise things more ugly,\r\nuncomfortable, and happily more perishable. There are two or\r\nthree plans, on one of which, according to its size, most of the\r\nhouses in the State are built. The poorest people build huts of\r\nlogs, laid horizontally in pens, stopping the interstices with mud.\r\nThese are warmer in winter, and cooler in summer, than the\r\nmore expensive construction of scantling and plank. The\r\nwealthy are attentive to the raising of vegetables, but very little\r\nso to fruits. The poorer people attend to neither, living principally\r\non milk and animal diet. This is the more inexcusable,\r\nas the climate requires indispensably a free use of vegetable food,\r\nfor health as well as comfort, and is very friendly to the raising\r\nof fruits. The only public buildings worthy mention are the\r\ncapitol, the palace, the college, and the hospital for lunatics, all\r\nof them in Williamsburg, heretofore the seat of our government.\r\nThe capitol is a light and airy structure, with a portico in front\r\nof two orders, the lower of which, being Doric, is tolerably just\r\nin its proportions and ornaments, save only that the intercolonations\r\nare too large. The upper is Ionic, much too small for that\r\non which it is mounted, its ornaments not proper to the order,\r\nnor proportioned within themselves. It is crowned with a pediment,\r\nwhich is too high for its span. Yet, on the whole, it is\r\nthe most pleasing piece of architecture we have. The palace is\r\nnot handsome without, but it is spacious and commodious within,\r\nis prettily situated, and with the grounds annexed to it, is capable\r\nof being made an elegant seat. The college and hospital\r\nare rude, misshapen piles, which, but that they have roofs, would\r\nbe taken for brick-kilns. There are no other public buildings\r\nbut churches and court-houses, in which no attempts are made\r\nat elegance. Indeed, it would not be easy to execute such an attempt,\r\nas a workman could scarcely be found capable of drawing\r\nan order. The genius of architecture seems to have shed its\r\nmaledictions over this land. Buildings are often erected, by individuals,\r\nof considerable expense. To give these symmetry and\r\ntaste, would not increase their cost. It would only change the\r\narrangement of the materials, the form and combination of the\r\nmembers. This would often cost less than the burthen of barbarous\r\nornaments with which these buildings are sometimes\r\ncharged. But the first principles of the art are unknown, and\r\nthere exists scarcely a model among us sufficiently chaste to give\r\nan idea of them. Architecture being one of the fine arts, and as\r\nsuch within the department of a professor of the college, according\r\nto the new arrangement, perhaps a spark may fall on some\r\nyoung subjects of natural taste, kindle up their genius, and produce\r\na reformation in this elegant and useful art. But all we\r\nshall do in this way will produce no permanent improvement\r\nto our country, while the unhappy prejudice prevails that houses\r\nof brick or stone are less wholesome than those of wood. A dew\r\nis often observed on the walls of the former in rainy weather,\r\nand the most obvious solution is, that the rain has penetrated\r\nthrough these walls. The following facts, however, are sufficient\r\nto prove the error of this solution: 1. This dew upon the walls\r\nappears when there is no rain, if the state of the atmosphere be\r\nmoist. 2. It appears upon the partition as well as the exterior\r\nwalls. 3. So, also, on pavements of brick or stone. 4. It is more\r\ncopious in proportion as the walls are thicker; the reverse of which\r\nought to be the case, if this hypothesis were just. If cold water be\r\npoured into a vessel of stone, or glass, a dew forms instantly on\r\nthe outside; but if it be poured into a vessel of wood, there is no\r\nsuch appearance. It is not supposed, in the first case, that the\r\nwater has exuded through the glass, but that it is precipitated\r\nfrom the circumambient air; as the humid particles of vapor,\r\npassing from the boiler of an alembic through its refrigerant, are\r\nprecipitated from the air, in which they are suspended, on the internal\r\nsurface of the refrigerant. Walls of brick and stone act\r\nas the refrigerant in this instance. They are sufficiently cold to\r\ncondense and precipitate the moisture suspended in the air of\r\nthe room, when it is heavily charged therewith. But walls of\r\nwood are not so. The question then is, whether the air in\r\nwhich this moisture is left floating, or that which is deprived of\r\nit, be most wholesome? In both cases the remedy is easy. A\r\nlittle fire kindled in the room, whenever the air is damp, prevents\r\nthe precipitation on the walls; and this practice, found healthy\r\nin the warmest as well as coldest seasons, is as necessary in a\r\nwooden as in a stone or brick house. I do not mean to say, that\r\nthe rain never penetrates through walls of brick. On the contrary,\r\nI have seen instances of it. But with us it is only through\r\nthe northern and eastern walls of the house, after a north-easterly\r\nstorm, this being the only one which continues long enough to\r\nforce through the walls. This, however, happens too rarely to\r\ngive a just character of unwholesomeness to such houses. In a\r\nhouse, the walls of which are of well-burnt brick and good mortar,\r\nI have seen the rain penetrate through but twice in a dozen\r\nor fifteen years. The inhabitants of Europe, who dwell chiefly\r\nin houses of stone or brick, are surely as healthy as those of Virginia.\r\nThese houses have the advantage, too, of being warmer\r\nin winter and cooler in summer than those of wood; of being\r\ncheaper in their first construction, where lime is convenient, and\r\ninfinitely more durable. The latter consideration renders it of\r\ngreat importance to eradicate this prejudice from the minds of\r\nour countrymen. A country whose buildings are of wood, can\r\nnever increase in its improvements to any considerable degree.\r\nTheir duration is highly estimated at fifty years. Every half\r\ncentury then our country becomes a _tabula rasa_, whereon we\r\nhave to set out anew, as in the first moment of seating it.\r\nWhereas when buildings are of durable materials, every new edifice\r\nis an actual and permanent acquisition to the State, adding\r\nto its value as well as to its ornament.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY XVI.\r\n\r\n_The measures taken with regard to the estates and possessions\r\nof the Rebels, commonly called tories?_\r\n\r\nA tory has been properly defined to be a traitor in thought but\r\nnot in deed. The only description, by which the laws have endeavored\r\nto come at them, was that of non-jurors, or persons refusing\r\nto take the oath of fidelity to the State. Persons of this\r\ndescription were at one time subjected to double taxation, at another\r\nto treble, and lastly were allowed retribution, and placed\r\non a level with good citizens. It may be mentioned as a proof,\r\nboth of the lenity of our government, and unanimity of its inhabitants,\r\nthat though this war has now raged near seven years,\r\nnot a single execution for treason has taken place.\r\n\r\nUnder this query I will state the measures which have been\r\nadopted as to British property, the owners of which stand on a\r\nmuch fairer footing than the tories. By our laws, the same as\r\nthe English as in this respect, no alien can hold lands, nor alien\r\nenemy maintain an action for money, or other movable thing.\r\nLands acquired or held by aliens become forfeited to the State;\r\nand, on an action by an alien enemy to recover money, or other\r\nmovable property, the defendant may plead that he is an alien\r\nenemy. This extinguishes his right in the hands of the debtor\r\nor holder of his movable property. By our separation from\r\nGreat Britain, British subjects became aliens, and being at war,\r\nthey were alien enemies. Their lands were of course forfeited,\r\nand their debts irrecoverable. The assembly, however, passed\r\nlaws at various times, for saving their property. They first sequestered\r\ntheir lands, slaves, and other property on their farms\r\nin the hands of commissioners, who were mostly the confidential\r\nfriends or agents of the owners, and directed their clear profits to\r\nbe paid into the treasury; and they gave leave to all persons\r\nowing debts to British subjects to pay them also into the treasury.\r\nThe monies so to be brought in were declared to remain the\r\nproperty of the British subject, and if used by the State, were to\r\nbe repaid, unless an improper conduct in Great Britain should\r\nrender a detention of it reasonable. Depreciation had at that\r\ntime, though unacknowledged and unperceived by the whigs,\r\nbegun in some small degree. Great sums of money were paid in\r\nby debtors. At a later period, the assembly, adhering to the political\r\nprinciples which forbid an alien to hold lands in the State,\r\nordered all British property to be sold; and, become sensible of\r\nthe real progress of depreciation, and of the losses which would\r\nthence occur, if not guarded against, they ordered that the proceeds\r\nof the sales should be converted into their then worth in\r\ntobacco, subject to the future direction of the legislature. This\r\nact has left the question of retribution more problematical. In\r\nMay, 1780, another act took away the permission to pay into the\r\npublic treasury debts due to British subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY XVII.\r\n\r\n_The different religions received into that State?_\r\n\r\nThe first settlers in this country were emigrants from England,\r\nof the English Church, just at a point of time when it was\r\nflushed with complete victory over the religious of all other persuasions.\r\nPossessed, as they became, of the powers of making,\r\nadministering, and executing the laws, they showed equal intolerance\r\nin this country with their Presbyterian brethren, who had\r\nemigrated to the northern government. The poor Quakers were\r\nflying from persecution in England. They cast their eyes on\r\nthese new countries as asylums of civil and religious freedom;\r\nbut they found them free only for the reigning sect. Several\r\nacts of the Virginia assembly of 1659, 1662, and 1693, had made\r\nit penal in parents to refuse to have their children baptized; had\r\nprohibited the unlawful assembling of Quakers; had made it\r\npenal for any master of a vessel to bring a Quaker into the State;\r\nhad ordered those already here, and such as should come thereafter,\r\nto be imprisoned till they should abjure the country; provided\r\na milder punishment for their first and second return, but\r\ndeath for their third; had inhibited all persons from suffering\r\ntheir meetings in or near their houses, entertaining them individually,\r\nor disposing of books which supported their tenets. If no\r\nexecution took place here, as did in New England, it was not\r\nowing to the moderation of the church, or spirit of the legislature,\r\nas may be inferred from the law itself; but to historical\r\ncircumstances which have not been handed down to us. The\r\nAnglicans retained full possession of the country about a century.\r\nOther opinions began then to creep in, and the great care of the\r\ngovernment to support their own church, having begotten an equal\r\ndegree of indolence in its clergy, two-thirds of the people had become\r\ndissenters at the commencement of the present revolution.\r\nThe laws, indeed, were still oppressive on them, but the spirit\r\nof the one party had subsided into moderation, and of the other\r\nhad risen to a degree of determination which commanded respect.\r\n\r\nThe present state of our laws on the subject of religion is this.\r\nThe convention of May 1776, in their declaration of rights, declared\r\nit to be a truth, and a natural right, that the exercise of\r\nreligion should be free; but when they proceeded to form on\r\nthat declaration the ordinance of government, instead of taking\r\nup every principle declared in the bill of rights, and guarding it\r\nby legislative sanction, they passed over that which asserted our\r\nreligious rights, leaving them as they found them. The same\r\nconvention, however, when they met as a member of the general\r\nassembly in October, 1776, repealed all _acts of Parliament_ which\r\nhad rendered criminal the maintaining any opinions in matters\r\nof religion, the forbearing to repair to church, and the exercising\r\nany mode of worship; and suspended the laws giving salaries to\r\nthe clergy, which suspension was made perpetual in October,\r\n1779. Statutory oppressions in religion being thus wiped away,\r\nwe remain at present under those only imposed by the common\r\nlaw, or by our own acts of assembly. At the common law,\r\n_heresy_ was a capital offence, punishable by burning. Its definition\r\nwas left to the ecclesiastical judges, before whom the conviction\r\nwas, till the statute of the 1 El. c. 1 circumscribed it,\r\nby declaring, that nothing should be deemed heresy, but what\r\nhad been so determined by authority of the canonical scriptures,\r\nor by one of the four first general councils, or by other\r\ncouncil, having for the grounds of their declaration the express\r\nand plain words of the scriptures. Heresy, thus circumscribed,\r\nbeing an offence against the common law, our act of assembly\r\nof October 1777, c. 17, gives cognizance of it to the general\r\ncourt, by declaring that the jurisdiction of that court shall be\r\ngeneral in all matters at the common law. The execution is by\r\nthe writ _De hæretico comburendo_. By our own act of assembly\r\nof 1705, c. 30, if a person brought up in the Christian religion\r\ndenies the being of a God, or the Trinity, or asserts there are\r\nmore gods than one, or denies the Christian religion to be true,\r\nor the scriptures to be of divine authority, he is punishable on\r\nthe first offence by incapacity to hold any office or employment\r\necclesiastical, civil, or military; on the second by disability to\r\nsue, to take any gift or legacy, to be guardian, executor, or administrator,\r\nand by three years' imprisonment without bail. A\r\nfather's right to the custody of his own children being founded\r\nin law on his right of guardianship, this being taken away, they\r\nmay of course be severed from him, and put by the authority of\r\na court into more orthodox hands. This is a summary view of\r\nthat religious slavery under which a people have been willing\r\nto remain, who have lavished their lives and fortunes for the establishment\r\nof their civil freedom. [63]The error seems not sufficiently\r\neradicated, that the operations of the mind, as well as\r\nthe acts of the body, are subject to the coercion of the laws. But\r\nour rulers can have no authority over such natural rights, only\r\nas we have submitted to them. The rights of conscience we\r\nnever submitted, we could not submit. We are answerable for\r\nthem to our God. The legitimate powers of government extend\r\nto such acts only as are injurious to others. But it does me no\r\ninjury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods, or no God.\r\nIt neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. If it be said, his\r\ntestimony in a court of justice cannot be relied on, reject it then,\r\nand be the stigma on him. Constraint may make him worse by\r\nmaking him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man.\r\nIt may fix him obstinately in his errors, but will not cure them.\r\nReason and free inquiry are the only effectual agents against\r\nerror. Give a loose to them, they will support the true religion\r\nby bringing every false one to their tribunal, to the test of their\r\ninvestigation. They are the natural enemies of error, and of\r\nerror only. Had not the Roman government permitted free inquiry,\r\nChristianity could never have been introduced. Had not\r\nfree inquiry been indulged at the era of the reformation, the corruptions\r\nof Christianity could not have been purged away. If it\r\nbe restrained now, the present corruptions will be protected, and\r\nnew ones encouraged. Was the government to prescribe to us\r\nour medicine and diet, our bodies would be in such keeping as\r\nour souls are now. Thus in France the emetic was once forbidden\r\nas a medicine, and the potato as an article of food. Government\r\nis just as infallible, too, when it fixes systems in physics.\r\nGalileo was sent to the Inquisition for affirming that the earth\r\nwas a sphere; the government had declared it to be as flat as a\r\ntrencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This\r\nerror, however, at length prevailed, the earth became a globe, and\r\nDescartes declared it was whirled round its axis by a vortex.\r\nThe government in which he lived was wise enough to see that\r\nthis was no question of civil jurisdiction, or we should all have\r\nbeen involved by authority in vortices. In fact, the vortices\r\nhave been exploded, and the Newtonian principle of gravitation\r\nis now more firmly established, on the basis of reason, than it\r\nwould be were the government to step in, and to make it an\r\narticle of necessary faith. Reason and experiment have been\r\nindulged, and error has fled before them. It is error alone which\r\nneeds the support of government. Truth can stand by itself.\r\nSubject opinion to coercion: whom will you make your inquisitors?\r\nFallible men; men governed by bad passions, by private\r\nas well as public reasons. And why subject it to coercion? To\r\nproduce uniformity. But is uniformity of opinion desirable?\r\nNo more than of face and stature. Introduce the bed of Procrustes\r\nthen, and as there is danger that the large men may beat\r\nthe small, make us all of a size, by lopping the former and\r\nstretching the latter. Difference of opinion is advantageous in\r\nreligion. The several sects perform the office of a _censor morum_\r\nover such other. Is uniformity attainable? Millions of innocent\r\nmen, women, and children, since the introduction of Christianity,\r\nhave been burnt, tortured, fined, imprisoned; yet we have not\r\nadvanced one inch towards uniformity. What has been the effect\r\nof coercion? To make one half the world fools, and the\r\nother half hypocrites. To support roguery and error all over\r\nthe earth. Let us reflect that it is inhabited by a thousand millions\r\nof people. That these profess probably a thousand different\r\nsystems of religion. That ours is but one of that thousand.\r\nThat if there be but one right, and ours that one, we should\r\nwish to see the nine hundred and ninety-nine wandering sects\r\ngathered into the fold of truth. But against such a majority we\r\ncannot effect this by force. Reason and persuasion are the only\r\npracticable instruments. To make way for these, free inquiry\r\nmust be indulged; and how can we wish others to indulge it\r\nwhile we refuse it ourselves. But every State, says an inquisitor,\r\nhas established some religion. No two, say I, have established\r\nthe same. Is this a proof of the infallibility of establishments?\r\nOur sister States of Pennsylvania and New York, however, have\r\nlong subsisted without any establishment at all. The experiment\r\nwas new and doubtful when they made it. It has answered\r\nbeyond conception. They flourish infinitely. Religion\r\nis well supported; of various kinds, indeed, but all good enough;\r\nall sufficient to preserve peace and order; or if a sect arises, whose\r\ntenets would subvert morals, good sense has fair play, and reasons\r\nand laughs it out of doors, without suffering the State to be\r\ntroubled with it. They do not hang more malefactors than we\r\ndo. They are not more disturbed with religious dissensions.\r\nOn the contrary, their harmony is unparalleled, and can be ascribed\r\nto nothing but their unbounded tolerance, because there\r\nis no other circumstance in which they differ from every nation\r\non earth. They have made the happy discovery, that the way\r\nto silence religious disputes, is to take no notice of them. Let\r\nus too give this experiment fair play, and get rid, while we may,\r\nof those tyrannical laws. It is true, we are as yet secured against\r\nthem by the spirit of the times. I doubt whether the people of\r\nthis country would suffer an execution for heresy, or a three\r\nyears' imprisonment for not comprehending the mysteries of the\r\nTrinity. But is the spirit of the people an infallible, a permanent\r\nreliance? Is it government? Is this the kind of protection\r\nwe receive in return for the rights we give up? Besides, the\r\nspirit of the times may alter, will alter. Our rulers will become\r\ncorrupt, our people careless. A single zealot may commence\r\npersecutor, and better men be his victims. It can never be too\r\noften repeated, that the time for fixing every essential right on a\r\nlegal basis is while our rulers are honest, and ourselves united.\r\nFrom the conclusion of this war we shall be going down hill.\r\nIt will not then be necessary to resort every moment to the people\r\nfor support. They will be forgotten, therefore, and their\r\nrights disregarded. They will forget themselves, but in the sole\r\nfaculty of making money, and will never think of uniting to effect\r\na due respect for their rights. The shackles, therefore,\r\nwhich shall not be knocked off at the conclusion of this war,\r\nwill remain on us long, will be made heavier and heavier, till\r\nour rights shall revive or expire in a convulsion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [63] Furneaux passim.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY XVIII.\r\n\r\n_The particular customs and manners that may happen to be\r\nreceived in that State?_\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine on the standard by which the manners\r\nof a nation may be tried, whether _catholic_ or _particular_.\r\nIt is more difficult for a native to bring to that standard the\r\nmanners of his own nation, familiarized to him by habit. There\r\nmust doubtless be an unhappy influence on the manners of our\r\npeople produced by the existence of slavery among us. The\r\nwhole commerce between master and slave is a perpetual exercise\r\nof the most boisterous passions, the most unremitting despotism\r\non the one part, and degrading submissions on the other. Our\r\nchildren see this, and learn to imitate it; for man is an imitative\r\nanimal. This quality is the germ of all education in him. From\r\nhis cradle to his grave he is learning to do what he sees others\r\ndo. If a parent could find no motive either in his philanthropy\r\nor his self-love, for restraining the intemperance of passion towards\r\nhis slave, it should always be a sufficient one that his\r\nchild is present. But generally it is not sufficient. The parent\r\nstorms, the child looks on, catches the lineaments of wrath, puts\r\non the same airs in the circle of smaller slaves, gives a loose to\r\nthe worst of passions, and thus nursed, educated, and daily exercised\r\nin tyranny, cannot but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities.\r\nThe man must be a prodigy who can retain his manners\r\nand morals undepraved by such circumstances. And with\r\nwhat execration should the statesman be loaded, who, permitting\r\none half the citizens thus to trample on the rights of the other,\r\ntransforms those into despots, and these into enemies, destroys\r\nthe morals of the one part, and the _amor patriæ_ of the other.\r\nFor if a slave can have a country in this world, it must be any\r\nother in preference to that in which he is born to live and labor\r\nfor another; in which he must lock up the faculties of his nature,\r\ncontribute as far as depends on his individual endeavors to the\r\nevanishment of the human race, or entail his own miserable condition\r\non the endless generations proceeding from him. With\r\nthe morals of the people, their industry also is destroyed. For\r\nin a warm climate, no man will labor for himself who can make\r\nanother labor for him. This is so true, that of the proprietors\r\nof slaves a very small proportion indeed are ever seen to labor.\r\nAnd can the liberties of a nation be thought secure when we\r\nhave removed their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds\r\nof the people that these liberties are of the gift of God? That\r\nthey are not to be violated but with his wrath? Indeed I tremble\r\nfor my country when I reflect that God is just; that his justice\r\ncannot sleep forever; that considering numbers, nature and natural\r\nmeans only, a revolution of the wheel of fortune, an exchange\r\nof situation is among possible events; that it may become\r\nprobable by supernatural interference! The Almighty\r\nhas no attribute which can take side with us in such a contest.\r\nBut it is impossible to be temperate and to pursue this subject\r\nthrough the various considerations of policy, of morals, of history\r\nnatural and civil. We must be contented to hope they will force\r\ntheir way into every one's mind. I think a change already perceptible,\r\nsince the origin of the present revolution. The spirit\r\nof the master is abating, that of the slave rising from the dust,\r\nhis condition mollifying, the way I hope preparing, under the\r\nauspices of heaven, for a total emancipation, and that this is disposed,\r\nin the order of events, to be with the consent of the masters,\r\nrather than by their extirpation.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY XIX.\r\n\r\n_The present state of manufactures, commerce, interior and exterior\r\ntrade?_\r\n\r\nWe never had an interior trade of any importance. Our exterior\r\ncommerce has suffered very much from the beginning of\r\nthe present contest. During this time we have manufactured\r\nwithin our families the most necessary articles of clothing.\r\nThose of cotton will bear some comparison with the same kinds\r\nof manufacture in Europe; but those of wool, flax and hemp are\r\nvery coarse, unsightly, and unpleasant; and such is our attachment\r\nto agriculture, and such our preference for foreign manufactures,\r\nthat be it wise or unwise, our people will certainly return\r\nas soon as they can, to the raising raw materials, and exchanging\r\nthem for finer manufactures than they are able to execute\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe political economists of Europe have established it as a\r\nprinciple, that every State should endeavor to manufacture for\r\nitself; and this principle, like many others, we transfer to America,\r\nwithout calculating the difference of circumstance which\r\nshould often produce a difference of result. In Europe the lands\r\nare either cultivated, or locked up against the cultivator. Manufacture\r\nmust therefore be resorted to of necessity not of choice\r\nto support the surplus of their people. But we have an immensity\r\nof land courting the industry of the husbandman. Is it\r\nbest then that all our citizens should be employed in its improvement,\r\nor that one half should be called off from that to exercise\r\nmanufactures and handicraft arts for the other? Those\r\nwho labor in the earth are the chosen people of God, if ever He\r\nhad a chosen people, whose breasts He has made His peculiar\r\ndeposit for substantial and genuine virtue. It is the focus in\r\nwhich he keeps alive that sacred fire, which otherwise might\r\nescape from the face of the earth. Corruption of morals in the\r\nmass of cultivators is a phenomenon of which no age nor nation\r\nhas furnished an example. It is the mark set on those, who,\r\nnot looking up to heaven, to their own soil and industry, as does\r\nthe husbandman, for their subsistence, depend for it on casualties\r\nand caprice of customers. Dependence begets subservience\r\nand venality, suffocates the germ of virtue, and prepares fit tools\r\nfor the designs of ambition. This, the natural progress and consequence\r\nof the arts, has sometimes perhaps been retarded by accidental\r\ncircumstances; but, generally speaking, the proportion\r\nwhich the aggregate of the other classes of citizens bears in any\r\nState to that of its husbandmen, is the proportion of its unsound\r\nto its healthy parts, and is a good enough barometer whereby to\r\nmeasure its degree of corruption. While we have land to labor\r\nthen, let us never wish to see our citizens occupied at a workbench,\r\nor twirling a distaff. Carpenters, masons, smiths, are\r\nwanting in husbandry; but, for the general operations of manufacture,\r\nlet our workshops remain in Europe. It is better to\r\ncarry provisions and materials to workmen there, than bring\r\nthem to the provisions and materials, and with them their manners\r\nand principles. The loss by the transportation of commodities\r\nacross the Atlantic will be made up in happiness and\r\npermanence of government. The mobs of great cities add just\r\nso much to the support of pure government, as sores do to the\r\nstrength of the human body. It is the manners and spirit of a\r\npeople which preserve a republic in vigor. A degeneracy in\r\nthese is a canker which soon eats to the heart of its laws and\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY XX.\r\n\r\n_A notice of the commercial productions particular to the State,\r\nand of those objects which the inhabitants are obliged to get\r\nfrom Europe and from other parts of the world?_\r\n\r\nBefore the present war we exported, _communibus annis_, according\r\nto the best information I can get, nearly as follows:\r\n\r\n  +----------------------+----------------+----------+----------------+\r\n  | Articles.            | Quantity.      |Dollars.  | Amount in      |\r\n  |                      |                |          | Dollars.       |\r\n  +----------------------+----------------+----------+----------------+\r\n  |Tobacco               | 55.000 hhds of | at 30d.  |                |\r\n  |                      | 1,000 lbs.     |per hhd.  | $1,650,000     |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Wheat                 |800,000 bushels.|at 5-6d.  |                |\r\n  |                      |                |per bush. |    666,666⅔    |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Indian corn           |600,000    \"    |at ⅓d.    |                |\r\n  |                      |                |per bush. |    200,000     |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Shipping              |    ........    |   ....   |    100,000     |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Masts, planks,       }|                |          |                |\r\n  |scantling, shingles, }|    ........    |   ....   |     66,666⅔    |\r\n  |staves               }|                |          |                |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Tar, pitch, turpentine| 30,000 barrels.|at 1⅓d.   |                |\r\n  |                      |                |per bbl.  |     40,000     |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Peltry, viz., skins  }|                |          |                |\r\n  |of deer, beavers,    }|180 hhds. of    |          |                |\r\n  |otters, musk rats,   }|600 lbs.        |at 5-12d. |                |\r\n  |raccoons,foxes       }|                |per lb.   |     42,000     |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Pork                  |  4,000 barrels.|at 10d.   |                |\r\n  |                      |                |per bbl.  |     40,000     |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Flax-seed, hemp,      |                |          |                |\r\n  |cotton                |    ........    |   ....   |      8,000     |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Pit coal, pig iron    |    ........    |   ....   |      6,666⅔    |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Peas                  |  5,000 bushels.|at ⅔d.    |                |\r\n  |                      |                |per bush. |      3,333⅓    |\r\n  |Beef                  |  1,000 barrels.|at 3⅓d.   |                |\r\n  |                      |                |per bbl.  |      3,333⅓    |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Sturgeon, white shad, |                |          |                |\r\n  |herring               |    ........    |   ....   |      3,333⅓    |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Brandy from peaches  }|    ........    |   ....   |      1,666⅔    |\r\n  |and apples, and      }|                |          |                |\r\n  |whiskey              }|                |          |                |\r\n  |                      |                |          |                |\r\n  |Horses                |    ........    |   ....   |      1,666⅔    |\r\n  |                      +----------------+----------+----------------+\r\n  |                      |    ........    |   ....   |[64]$2,833,333⅓ |\r\n  +----------------------+----------------+----------+----------------+\r\n\r\nIn the year 1758 we exported seventy thousand hogsheads of\r\ntobacco, which was the greatest quantity ever produced in this\r\ncountry in one year. But its culture was fast declining at the\r\ncommencement of this war and that of wheat taken its place;\r\nand it must continue to decline on the return of peace. I suspect\r\nthat the change in the temperature of our climate has become\r\nsensible to that plant, which to be good, requires an extraordinary\r\ndegree of heat. But it requires still more indispensably\r\nan uncommon fertility of soil; and the price which it commands\r\nat market will not enable the planter to produce this by manure.\r\nWas the supply still to depend on Virginia and Maryland alone\r\nas its culture becomes more difficult, the price would rise so as\r\nto enable the planter to surmount those difficulties and to live.\r\nBut the western country on the Mississippi, and the midlands of\r\nGeorgia, having fresh and fertile lands in abundance, and a hotter\r\nsun, will be able to undersell these two States, and will oblige\r\nthem to abandon the raising of tobacco altogether. And a happy\r\nobligation for them it will be. It is a culture productive of\r\ninfinite wretchedness. Those employed in it are in a continual\r\nstate of exertion beyond the power of nature to support. Little\r\nfood of any kind is raised by them; so that the men and animals\r\non these farms are badly fed, and the earth is rapidly impoverished.\r\nThe cultivation of wheat is the reverse in every\r\ncircumstance. Besides clothing the earth with herbage, and preserving\r\nits fertility, it feeds the laborers plentifully, requires from\r\nthem only a moderate toil, except in the season of harvest, raises\r\ngreat numbers of animals for food and service, and diffuses plenty\r\nand happiness among the whole. We find it easier to make an\r\nhundred bushels of wheat than a thousand weight of tobacco,\r\nand they are worth more when made. The weavil indeed is a\r\nformidable obstacle to the cultivation of this grain with us. But\r\nprinciples are already known which must lead to a remedy.\r\nThus a certain degree of heat, to wit, that of the common air\r\nin summer, is necessary to hatch the eggs. If subterranean granaries,\r\nor others, therefore, can be contrived below that temperature,\r\nthe evil will be cured by cold. A degree of heat beyond\r\nthat which hatches the egg we know will kill it. But in aiming\r\nat this we easily run into that which produced putrefaction. To\r\nproduce putrefaction, however, three agents are requisite, heat,\r\nmoisture, and the external air. If the absence of any one of\r\nthese be secured, the other two may safely be admitted. Heat is\r\nthe one we want. Moisture then, or external air, must be excluded.\r\nThe former has been done by exposing the grain in\r\nkilns to the action of fire, which produces heat, and extracts\r\nmoisture at the same time; the latter, by putting the grain into\r\nhogsheads, covering it with a coating of lime, and heading it up.\r\nIn this situation its bulk produced a heat sufficient to kill the\r\neggs; the moisture is suffered to remain indeed, but the external\r\nair is excluded. A nicer operation yet has been attempted; that\r\nis, to produce an intermediate temperature of heat between that\r\nwhich kills the egg, and that which produces putrefaction. The\r\nthreshing the grain as soon as it is cut, and laying it in its chaff\r\nin large heaps, has been found very nearly to hit this temperature,\r\nthough not perfectly, nor always. The heap generates\r\nheat sufficient to kill most of the eggs, whilst the chaff commonly\r\nrestrains it from rising into putrefaction. But all these\r\nmethods abridge too much the quantity which the farmer can\r\nmanage, and enable other countries to undersell him, which are\r\nnot infested with this insect. There is still a desideratum then\r\nto give with us decisive triumph to this branch of agriculture\r\nover that of tobacco. The culture of wheat by enlarging our\r\npasture, will render the Arabian horse an article of very considerable\r\nprofit. Experience has shown that ours is the particular\r\nclimate of America where he may be raised without degeneracy.\r\nSouthwardly the heat of the sun occasions a deficiency\r\nof pasture, and northwardly the winters are too cold for the short\r\nand fine hair, the particular sensibility and constitution of that\r\nrace. Animals transplanted into unfriendly climates, either\r\nchange their nature and acquire new senses against the new\r\ndifficulties in which they are placed, or they multiply poorly and\r\nbecome extinct. A good foundation is laid for their propagation\r\nhere by our possessing already great numbers of horses of that\r\nblood, and by a decided taste and preference for them established\r\namong the people. Their patience of heat without injury, their\r\nsuperior wind, fit them better in this and the more southern climates\r\neven for the drudgeries of the plough and wagon. Northwardly\r\nthey will become an object only to persons of taste and\r\nfortune, for the saddle and light carriages. To those, and for\r\nthese uses, their fleetness and beauty will recommend them. Besides\r\nthese there will be other valuable substitutes when the cultivation\r\nof tobacco shall be discontinued such as cotton in the\r\neastern parts of the State, and hemp and flax in the western.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to say what are the articles either of necessity,\r\ncomfort, or luxury, which we cannot raise, and which we therefore\r\nshall be under a necessity of importing from abroad, as everything\r\nhardier than the olive, and as hardy as the fig, may be\r\nraised here in the open air. Sugar, coffee and tea, indeed, are\r\nnot between these limits; and habit having placed them among\r\nthe necessaries of life with the wealthy part of our citizens, as\r\nlong as these habits remain we must go for them to those countries\r\nwhich are able to furnish them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [64] This sum is equal to £850,000; Virginia money, 607,142\r\n         guineas.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY XXI.\r\n\r\n_The weights, measures and the currency of the hard money?\r\nSome details relating to exchange with Europe?_\r\n\r\nOur weights and measures are the same which are fixed by\r\nacts of parliament in England. How it has happened that in\r\nthis as well as the other American States the nominal value of\r\ncoin was made to differ from what it was in the country we had\r\nleft, and to differ among ourselves too, I am not able to say with\r\ncertainty. I find that in 1631 our house of burgesses desired of\r\nthe privy council in England, a coin debased to twenty-five per\r\ncent.; that in 1645 they forbid dealing by barter for tobacco,\r\nand established the Spanish piece of eight at six shillings, as the\r\nstandard of their currency; that in 1655 they changed it to five\r\nshillings sterling. In 1680 they sent an address to the king, in\r\nconsequence of which, by proclamation in 1683, he fixed the\r\nvalue of French crowns, rix dollars, and pieces of eight, at six\r\nshillings, and the coin of New England at one shilling. That\r\nin 1710, 1714, 1727, and 1762, other regulations were made,\r\nwhich will be better presented to the eye stated in the form of a\r\ntable as follows:\r\n\r\n  -------------------------------------+-----+--------+-------+-------\r\n                                       | 1710|  1714. | 1797. | 1762.\r\n  -------------------------------------+-----+--------+-------+-------\r\n                                       |     |        |       |\r\n  Guineas                              | ..  |26s.    |       |\r\n                                       |     |        |       |\r\n  British gold coin not milled, gold   |     |        |       |\r\n   coin of Spain and France, chequins, |     |        |       |\r\n   Arabian gold, moidores of Portugal  | ..  |5s. dwt.|       |\r\n                                       |     |        |       |\r\n  Coined gold of the empire            | ..  |5s. dwt.|  ..   |4s. 3d.\r\n                                       |     |        |       |  dwt.\r\n  English milled silver money, in      |     |        |       |\r\n   proportion to the crown, at         | ..  |5s. 10d.|6s. 3d.|\r\n                                       |     |        |       |\r\n  Pieces of eight of Mexico, Seville   |     |        |       |\r\n   & Pillar, ducatoons of Flanders,    |     |        |       |\r\n   French ecus, or silver Louis,       |3¾d. |   ..   |4d.    |\r\n   crusados of Portugal                | dwt.|        | dwt.  |\r\n                                       |     |        |       |\r\n  Peru pieces, cross dollars, and old  |3½d. |   ..   |3¾d.   |\r\n   rix dollars of the empire           | dwt.|        | dwt.  |\r\n                                       |     |        |       |\r\n  Old British silver not milled        | ..  |3¾d.    |       |\r\n                                       |     |  dwt.  |       |\r\n  -------------------------------------+-----+--------+-------+-------\r\n\r\nThe first symptom of the depreciation of our present paper\r\nmoney, was that of silver dollars selling at six shillings, which\r\nhad before been worth but five shilling and ninepence. The\r\nassembly thereupon raised them by law to six shillings. As the\r\ndollar is now likely to become the money-unit of America, as it\r\npasses at this rate in some of our sister States, and as it facilitates\r\ntheir computation in pounds and shillings, &c., converso, this\r\nseems to be more convenient than its former denomination. But\r\nas this particular coin now stands higher than any other in the\r\nproportion of one hundred and thirty-three and a half to one\r\nhundred and twenty-five, or sixteen to fifteen, it will be necessary\r\nto raise the others in proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY XXII.\r\n\r\n_The public Income and expenses?_\r\n\r\nThe nominal amount of these varying constantly and rapidly,\r\nwith the constant and rapid depreciation of our paper money, it\r\nbecomes impracticable to say what they are. We find ourselves\r\ncheated in every essay by the depreciation intervening between\r\nthe declaration of the tax and its actual receipt. It will therefore\r\nbe more satisfactory to consider what our income may be when\r\nwe shall find means of collecting what our people may spare. I\r\nshould estimate the whole taxable property of this State at an\r\nhundred millions of dollars, or thirty millions of pounds, our\r\nmoney. One per cent. on this, compared with anything we\r\never yet paid, would be deemed a very heavy tax. Yet I think\r\nthat those who manage well, and use reasonable economy, could\r\npay one and a half per cent., and maintain their household comfortably\r\nin the meantime, without aliening any part of their\r\nprincipal, and that the people would submit to this willingly for\r\nthe purpose of supporting their present contest. We may say,\r\nthen, that we could raise, from one million to one million and a\r\nhalf of dollars annually, that is from three hundred to four hundred\r\nand fifty thousand pounds, Virginia money.\r\n\r\nOf our expenses it is equally difficult to give an exact state,\r\nand for the same reason. They are mostly stated in paper\r\nmoney, which varying continually, the legislature endeavors at\r\nevery session, by new corrections, to adapt the nominal sums to\r\nthe value it is wished they would bear. I will state them, therefore,\r\nin real coin, at the point at which they endeavor to keep them:\r\n\r\n                                                               Dollars.\r\n     The annual expenses of the general assembly are about     20,000\r\n     The governor                                               3,333⅓\r\n     The council of state                                      10,666⅔\r\n           Their clerks                                         1,166⅔\r\n     Eleven judges                                             11,000\r\n           The clerk of the chancery                              666⅔\r\n     The attorney general                                       1,000\r\n     Three auditors and a solicitor                             5,333⅓\r\n           Their clerks                                         2,000\r\n     The treasurer                                              2,000\r\n           His clerks                                           2,000\r\n     The keeper of the public jail                              1,000\r\n     The public printer                                         1,666⅔\r\n     Clerks of the inferior courts                             43,333⅓\r\n     Public levy; this is chiefly for the expenses of\r\n       criminal justice                                        40,000\r\n     County levy, for bridges, court-houses, prisons, &c.      40,000\r\n     Members of Congress                                        7,000\r\n     Quota of the federal civil list, supposed one-sixth\r\n       of about $78,000                                        13,000\r\n     Expenses of collecting, six per cent. on the above        12,310\r\n     The clergy receive only voluntary contributions;\r\n       suppose them on an average one-eighth of a dollar\r\n       a tythe on 200,000 tythes                               25,000\r\n     Contingencies, to make round numbers not far from truth    7,523⅓\r\n                                                             ---------\r\n                                                             $250,000\r\n\r\nor 53,571 guineas. This estimate is exclusive of the military\r\nexpense. That varies with the force actually employed, and in\r\ntime of peace will probably be little or nothing. It is exclusive\r\nalso of the public debts, which are growing while I am\r\nwriting, and cannot therefore be now fixed. So it is of the\r\nmaintenance of the poor, which being merely a matter of charity\r\ncannot be deemed expended in the administration of government.\r\nAnd if we strike out the $25,000 for the services of the\r\nclergy, which neither makes part of that administration, more\r\nthan what is paid to physicians, or lawyers, and being voluntary,\r\nis either much or nothing as every one pleases, it leaves $225,000,\r\nequal to 48,208 guineas, the real cost of the apparatus of\r\ngovernment with us. This divided among the actual inhabitants\r\nof our country, comes to about two-fifths of a dollar,\r\ntwenty-one pence sterling, or forty-two sols, the price which\r\neach pays annually for the protection of the residue of his property,\r\nand the other advantages of a free government. The\r\npublic revenues of Great Britain divided in like manner on its\r\ninhabitants would be sixteen times greater. Deducting even the\r\ndouble of the expenses of government, as before estimated, from\r\nthe million and a half of dollars which we before supposed might\r\nbe annually paid without distress, we may conclude that this\r\nState can contribute one million of dollars annually towards supporting\r\nthe federal army, paying the federal debt, building a\r\nfederal navy, or opening roads, clearing rivers, forming safe ports,\r\nand other useful works.\r\n\r\nTo this estimate of our abilities, let me add a word as to the\r\napplication of them. If, when cleared of the present contest,\r\nand of the debts with which that will charge us, we come to\r\nmeasure force hereafter with any European power. Such events\r\nare devoutly to be deprecated. Young as we are, and with such\r\na country before us to fill with people and with happiness, we\r\nshould point in that direction the whole generative force of nature,\r\nwasting none of it in efforts of mutual destruction. It\r\nshould be our endeavor to cultivate the peace and friendship of\r\nevery nation, even of that which has injured us most, when we\r\nshall have carried our point against her. Our interest will be to\r\nthrow open the doors of commerce, and to knock off all its\r\nshackles, giving perfect freedom to all persons for the vent of\r\nwhatever they may chose to bring into our ports, and asking the\r\nsame in theirs. Never was so much false arithmetic employed\r\non any subject, as that which has been employed to persuade nations\r\nthat it is their interest to go to war. Were the money\r\nwhich it has cost to gain, at the close of a long war, a little town,\r\nor a little territory, the right to cut wood here, or to catch fish\r\nthere, expended in improving what they already possess, in making\r\nroads, opening rivers, building ports, improving the arts, and\r\nfinding employment for their idle poor, it would render them\r\nmuch stronger, much wealthier and happier. This I hope will\r\nbe our wisdom. And, perhaps, to remove as much as possible\r\nthe occasions of making war, it might be better for us to abandon\r\nthe ocean altogether, that being the element whereon we\r\nshall be principally exposed to jostle with other nations; to leave\r\nto others to bring what we shall want, and to carry what we can\r\nspare. This would make us invulnerable to Europe, by offering\r\nnone of our property to their prize, and would turn all our citizens\r\nto the cultivation of the earth; and, I repeat it again, cultivators\r\nof the earth are the most virtuous and independent citizens.\r\nIt might be time enough to seek employment for them\r\nat sea, when the land no longer offers it. But the actual habits\r\nof our countrymen attach them to commerce. They will exercise\r\nit for themselves. Wars then must sometimes be our lot;\r\nand all the wise can do, will be to avoid that half of them which\r\nwould be produced by our own follies and our own acts of injustice;\r\nand to make for the other half the best preparations we\r\ncan. Of what nature should these be? A land army would be\r\nuseless for offence, and not the best nor safest instrument of defence.\r\nFor either of these purposes, the sea is the field on\r\nwhich we should meet an European enemy. On that element\r\nit is necessary we should possess some power. To aim at such\r\na navy as the greater nations of Europe possess, would be a foolish\r\nand wicked waste of the energies of our countrymen. It\r\nwould be to pull on our own heads that load of military expense\r\nwhich makes the European laborer go supperless to bed, and\r\nmoistens his bread with the sweat of his brows. It will be\r\nenough if we enable ourselves to prevent insults from those nations\r\nof Europe which are weak on the sea, because circumstances\r\nexist, which render even the stronger ones weak as to\r\nus. Providence has placed their richest and most defenceless\r\npossessions at our door; has obliged their most precious commerce\r\nto pass, as it were, in review before us. To protect this,\r\nor to assail, a small part only of their naval force will ever be\r\nrisked across the Atlantic. The dangers to which the elements\r\nexpose them here are too well known, and the greater dangers\r\nto which they would be exposed at home were any general calamity\r\nto involve their whole fleet. They can attack us by detachment\r\nonly; and it will suffice to make ourselves equal to\r\nwhat they may detach. Even a smaller force than they may\r\ndetach will be rendered equal or superior by the quickness with\r\nwhich any check may be repaired with us, while losses with\r\nthem will be irreparable till too late. A small naval force then\r\nis sufficient for us, and a small one is necessary. What this\r\nshould be, I will not undertake to say. I will only say, it should\r\nby no means be so great as we are able to make it. Suppose\r\nthe million of dollars, or three hundred thousand pounds, which\r\nVirginia could annually spare without distress, to be applied to\r\nthe creating a navy. A single year's contribution would build,\r\nequip, man, and send to sea a force which should carry three\r\nhundred guns. The rest of the confederacy, exerting themselves\r\nin the same proportion, would equip in the same time fifteen\r\nhundred guns more. So that one year's contributions would set\r\nup a navy of eighteen hundred guns. The British ships of the\r\nline average seventy-six guns; their frigates thirty-eight. Eighteen\r\nhundred guns then would form a fleet of thirty ships, eighteen\r\nof which might be of the line, and twelve frigates. Allowing\r\neight men, the British average, for every gun, their annual\r\nexpense, including subsistence, clothing, pay, and ordinary repairs,\r\nwould be about $1,280 for every gun, or $2,304,000 for\r\nthe whole. I state this only as one year's possible exertion,\r\nwithout deciding whether more or less than a year's exertion\r\nshould be thus applied.\r\n\r\nThe value of our lands and slaves, taken conjunctly, doubles\r\nin about twenty years. This arises from the multiplication of\r\nour slaves, from the extension of culture, and increased demand\r\nfor lands. The amount of what may be raised will of course\r\nrise in the same proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUERY XXIII.\r\n\r\n_The histories of the State, the memorials published in its name\r\nin the time of its being a colony, and the pamphlets relating\r\nto its interior or exterior affairs present or ancient?_\r\n\r\nCaptain Smith, who next to Sir Walter Raleigh may be considered\r\nas the founder of our colony, has written its history, from\r\nthe first adventures to it, till the year 1624. He was a member\r\nof the council, and afterwards president of the colony; and to\r\nhis efforts principally may be ascribed its support against the opposition\r\nof the natives. He was honest, sensible, and well informed;\r\nbut his style is barbarous and uncouth. His history,\r\nhowever, is almost the only source from which we derive any\r\nknowledge of the infancy of our State.\r\n\r\nThe reverend William Stith, a native of Virginia, and president\r\nof its college, has also written the history of the same\r\nperiod, in a large octavo volume of small print. He was a man\r\nof classical learning, and very exact, but of no taste in style.\r\nHe is inelegant, therefore, and his details often too minute to be\r\ntolerable, even to a native of the country, whose history he\r\nwrites.\r\n\r\nBeverley, a native also, has run into the other extreme, he has\r\ncomprised our history from the first propositions of Sir Walter\r\nRaleigh to the year 1700, in the hundredth part of the space\r\nwhich Stith employs for the fourth part of the period.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Keith has taken it up at its earliest period, and continued\r\nit to the year 1725. He is agreeable enough in style, and\r\npasses over events of little importance. Of course he is short\r\nand would be preferred by a foreigner.\r\n\r\nDuring the regal government, some contest arose on the exaction\r\nof an illegal fee by governor Dinwiddie, and doubtless there\r\nwere others on other occasions not at present recollected. It is\r\nsupposed that these are not sufficiently interesting to a foreigner\r\nto merit a detail.\r\n\r\nThe petition of the council and burgesses of Virginia to the\r\nking, their memorials to the lords, and remonstrance to the commons\r\nin the year 1764, began the present contest; and these\r\nhaving proved ineffectual to prevent the passage of the stamp-act,\r\nthe resolutions of the house of burgesses of 1765 were passed\r\ndeclaring the independence of the people of Virginia of the parliament\r\nof Great Britain, in matters of taxation. From that\r\ntime till the declaration of independence by Congress in 1776,\r\ntheir journals are filled with assertions of the public rights.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlets published in this State on the controverted\r\nquestion, were:\r\n\r\n     1766, An Inquiry into the rights of the British Colonies, by\r\n     Richard Bland.\r\n\r\n     1769, The Monitor's Letters, by Dr. Arthur Lee.\r\n\r\n     1774, A summary View of the rights of British America.[65]\r\n\r\n     1774, Considerations, &c., by Robert Carter Nicholas.\r\n\r\nSince the declaration of independence this State has had no\r\ncontroversy with any other, except with that of Pennsylvania,\r\non their common boundary. Some papers on this subject passed\r\nbetween the executive and legislative bodies of the two States,\r\nthe result of which was a happy accommodation of their rights.\r\n\r\nTo this account of our historians, memorials, and pamphlets,\r\nit may not be unuseful to add a chronological catalogue of American\r\nstate-papers, as far as I have been able to collect their titles.\r\nIt is far from being either complete or correct. Where the title\r\nalone, and not the paper itself, has come under my observation,\r\nI cannot answer for the exactness of the date. Sometimes I\r\nhave not been able to find any date at all, and sometimes have\r\nnot been satisfied that such a paper exists. An extensive collection\r\nof papers of this description has been for some time in a\r\ncourse of preparation by a gentleman[66] fully equal to the task,\r\nand from whom, therefore, we may hope ere long to receive it.\r\nIn the meantime accept this as the result of my labors, and as\r\nclosing the tedious detail which you have so undesignedly drawn\r\nupon yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Pro Johanne Caboto et filiis suis super terra          1496, Mar. 5.\r\n  incognita investiganda 12.

M.S.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [65] By the author of these notes.\r\n\r\n    [66] Mr. Hazard.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nThe preceding sheets have been submitted to my friend Mr.\r\nCharles Thompson, Secretary of Congress; he has furnished me\r\nwith the following observations, which have too much merit not\r\nto be communicated:\r\n\r\n(A.) p. 262. Besides the three channels of communication\r\nmentioned between the western waters and the Atlantic, there\r\nare two others to which the Pennsylvanians are turning their attention;\r\none from Presque Isle, on Lake Erie, to Le Bœuf, down\r\nthe Alleghany to Kiskiminitas, then up the Kiskiminitas, and\r\nfrom thence, by a small portage, to Juniata, which falls into the\r\nSusquehanna; the other from Lake Ontario to the East Branch\r\nof the Delaware, and down that to Philadelphia. Both these are\r\nsaid to be very practicable; and, considering the enterprising\r\ntemper of the Pennsylvanians, and particularly of the merchants\r\nof Philadelphia, whose object is concentred in promoting the\r\ncommerce and trade of one city, it is not improbable but one or\r\nboth of these communications will be opened and improved.\r\n\r\n(B.) p. 265. The reflections I was led into on viewing this\r\npassage of the Potomac through the Blue Ridge were, that this\r\ncountry must have suffered some violent convulsion, and that\r\nthe face of it must have been changed from what it probably\r\nwas some centuries ago; that the broken and ragged faces of the\r\nmountain on each side the river; the tremendous rocks, which\r\nare left with one end fixed in the precipice, and the other jutting\r\nout, and seemingly ready to fall for want of support, the bed of\r\nthe river for several miles below obstructed, and filled with the\r\nloose stones carried from this mound; in short, everything on\r\nwhich you cast your eye evidently demonstrates a disrupture and\r\nbreach in the mountain, and that, before this happened, what is\r\nnow a fruitful vale, was formerly a great lake or collection of\r\nwater, which possibly might have here formed a mighty cascade,\r\nor had its vent to the ocean by the Susquehanna, where\r\nthe Blue Ridge seems to terminate. Besides this, there are other\r\nparts of this country which bear evident traces of a like convulsion.\r\nFrom the best accounts I have been able to obtain, the\r\nplace where the Delaware now flows through the Kittatinney\r\nmountain, which is a continuation of what is called the North\r\nRidge, or mountain, was not its original course, but that it passed\r\nthrough what is now called \"the Wind-gap,\" a place several\r\nmiles to the westward, and about a hundred feet higher than\r\nthe present bed of the river. This Wind-gap is about a mile\r\nbroad, and the stones in it such as seem to have been washed\r\nfor ages by water running over them. Should this have been\r\nthe case, there must have been a large lake behind that mountain,\r\nand by some uncommon swell in the waters, or by some\r\nconvulsion of nature, the river must have opened its way through\r\na different part of the mountain, and meeting there with less obstruction,\r\ncarried away with it the opposing mounds of earth,\r\nand deluged the country below with the immense collection of\r\nwaters to which this new passage gave vent. There are still\r\nremaining, and daily discovered, innumerable instances of such\r\na deluge on both sides of the river, after it passed the hills above\r\nthe falls of Trenton, and reached the Champaign. On the New\r\nJersey side, which is flatter than the Pennsylvania side, all the\r\ncountry below Croswick hills seems to have been overflowed to\r\nthe distance of from ten to fifteen miles back from the river, and\r\nto have acquired a new soil by the earth and clay brought down\r\nand mixed with the native sand. The spot on which Philadelphia\r\nstands evidently appears to be made ground. The different\r\nstrata through which they pass in digging to water, the\r\nacorns, leaves, and sometimes branches, which are found above\r\ntwenty feet below the surface, all seem to demonstrate this. I\r\nam informed that at Yorktown in Virginia, in the bank of York\r\nriver, there are different strata of shells and earth, one above another,\r\nwhich seem to point out that the country there has undergone\r\nseveral changes; that the sea has, for a succession of ages,\r\noccupied the place where dry land now appears; and that the\r\nground has been suddenly raised at various periods. What a\r\nchange would it make in the country below, should the mountains\r\nat Niagara, by any accident, be cleft asunder, and a passage\r\nsuddenly opened to drain off the waters of Erie and the\r\nupper lakes! While ruminating on these subjects, I have often\r\nbeen hurried away by fancy, and led to imagine, that what is\r\nnow the bay of Mexico, was once a champaign country; and\r\nthat from the point or cape of Florida, there was a continued\r\nrange of mountains through Cuba, Hispaniola, Porto Rico, Martinique,\r\nGuadaloupe, Barbadoes, and Trinidad, till it reached the\r\ncoast of America, and formed the shores which bounded the\r\nocean, and guarded the country behind; that by some convulsion\r\nor shock of nature, the sea had broken through these\r\nmounds, and deluged that vast plain, till it reached the foot of\r\nthe Andes; that being there heaped up by the trade winds, always\r\nblowing from one quarter, it had found its way back, as it\r\ncontinues to do, through the Gulf between Florida and Cuba,\r\ncarrying with it the loom and sand it may have scooped from\r\nthe country it had occupied, part of which it may have deposited\r\non the shores of North America, and with part formed the banks\r\nof Newfoundland. But these are only the visions of fancy.\r\n\r\n(3.) p. 283. There is a plant, or weed, called the Jamestown\r\nweed,[67] of a very singular quality. The late Dr. Bond informed\r\nme, that he had under his care a patient, a young girl, who had\r\nput the seeds of this plant into her eye, which dilated the pupil\r\nto such a degree, that she could see in the dark, but in the light\r\nwas almost blind. The effect that the leaves had when eaten\r\nby a ship's crew that arrived at Jamestown, are well known.[68]\r\n\r\n(4.) p. 312. Monsieur Buffon has indeed given an afflicting\r\npicture of human nature in his description of the man of America.\r\nBut sure I am there never was a picture more unlike the\r\noriginal. He grants indeed that his stature is the same as that\r\nof the man of Europe. He might have admitted, that the Iroquois\r\nwere larger, and the Lenopi, or Delawares, taller than people\r\nin Europe generally are. But he says their organs of generation\r\nare smaller and weaker than those of Europeans. Is this\r\na fact? I believe not; at least it is an observation I never heard\r\nbefore.--\"They have no beard.\" Had he known the pains\r\nand trouble it costs the men to pluck out by the roots the hair\r\nthat grows on their faces, he would have seen that nature had\r\nnot been deficient in that respect. Every nation has its customs.\r\nI have seen an Indian beau, with a looking-glass in his\r\nhand, examining his face for hours together, and plucking out\r\nby the roots every hair he could discover, with a kind of tweezer\r\nmade of a piece of fine brass wire, that had been twisted round\r\na stick, and which he used with great dexterity.--\"They have\r\nno ardor for their females.\" It is true they do not indulge those\r\nexcesses, nor discover that fondness which is customary in Europe;\r\nbut this is not owing to a defect in nature but to manners.\r\nTheir soul is wholly bent upon war. This is what procures\r\nthem glory among the men, and makes them the admiration of\r\nthe women. To this they are educated from their earliest youth.\r\nWhen they pursue game with ardor, when they bear the fatigues\r\nof the chase, when they sustain and suffer patiently hunger and\r\ncold; it is not so much for the sake of the game they pursue, as\r\nto convince their parents and the council of the nation that they\r\nare fit to be enrolled in the number of the warriors. The songs\r\nof the women, the dance of the warriors, the sage counsel of\r\nthe chiefs, the tales of the old, the triumphal entry of the warriors\r\nreturning with success from battle, and the respect paid to\r\nthose who distinguish themselves in war, and in subduing their\r\nenemies; in short, everything they see or hear tends to inspire\r\nthem with an ardent desire for military fame. If a young man\r\nwere to discover a fondness for women before he has been to\r\nwar, he would become the contempt of the men, and the scorn\r\nand ridicule of the women. Or were he to indulge himself with\r\na captive taken in war, and much more were he to offer violence\r\nin order to gratify his lust, he would incur indelible disgrace.\r\nThe seeming frigidity of the men, therefore, is the effect of\r\nmanners, and not a defect of nature. Besides, a celebrated warrior\r\nis oftener courted by the females, than he has occasion to\r\ncourt; and this is a point of honor which the men aim at. Instances\r\nsimilar to that of Ruth and Boaz[69] are not uncommon\r\namong them. For though the women are modest and diffident,\r\nand so bashful that they seldom lift up their eyes, and scarce\r\never look a man full in the face, yet, being brought up in great\r\nsubjection, custom and manners reconcile them to modes of acting,\r\nwhich, judged of by Europeans, would be deemed inconsistent\r\nwith the rules of female decorum and propriety. I once\r\nsaw a young widow, whose husband, a warrior, had died about\r\neight days before, hastening to finish her grief, and who, by\r\ntearing her hair, beating her breast, and drinking spirits, made\r\nthe tears flow in great abundance, in order that she might grieve\r\nmuch in a short space of time, and be married that evening to\r\nanother young warrior. The manner in which this was viewed\r\nby the men and women of the tribe, who stood round, silent\r\nand solemn spectators of the scene, and the indifference with\r\nwhich they answered my question respecting it, convinced me\r\nthat it was no unusual custom. I have known men advanced\r\nin years, whose wives were old and past child-bearing, take\r\nyoung wives, and have children, though the practice of polygamy\r\nis not common. Does this savor of frigidity, or want of ardor\r\nfor the female? Neither do they seem to be deficient in natural\r\naffection. I have seen both fathers and mothers in the deepest\r\naffliction, when their children have been dangerously ill; though\r\nI believe the affection is stronger in the descending than the ascending\r\nscale, and though custom forbids a father to grieve immoderately\r\nfor a son slain in battle. \"That they are timorous\r\nand cowardly,\" is a character with which there is little reason\r\nto charge them, when we recollect the manner in which the\r\nIroquois met Monsieur ----, who marched into their country;\r\nin which the old men, who scorned to fly, or to survive the capture\r\nof their town, braved death, like the old Romans in the\r\ntime of the Gauls, and in which they soon after revenged themselves\r\nby sacking and destroying Montreal. But above all, the\r\nunshaken fortitude with which they bear the most excruciating\r\ntortures and death when taken prisoners, ought to exempt them\r\nfrom that character. Much less are they to be characterized as a\r\npeople of no vivacity, and who are excited to action or motion\r\nonly by the calls of hunger and thirst. Their dances in which\r\nthey so much delight, and which to an European would be the\r\nmost severe exercise, fully contradict this, not to mention their\r\nfatiguing marches, and the toil they voluntarily and cheerfully\r\nundergo in their military expeditions. It is true, that when at\r\nhome, they do not employ themselves in labor or the culture of\r\nthe soil; but this again is the effect of customs and manners,\r\nwhich have assigned that to the province of the women. But it\r\nis said, they are averse to society and a social life. Can anything\r\nbe more inapplicable than this to a people who always live\r\nin towns or clans? Or can they be said to have no \"republic,\"\r\nwho conduct all their affairs in national councils, who pride\r\nthemselves in their national character, who consider an insult\r\nor injury done to an individual by a stranger as done to the\r\nwhole, and resent it accordingly? In short, this picture is not\r\napplicable to any nation of Indians I have ever known or heard\r\nof in North America.\r\n\r\n(5.) p. 340. As far as I have been able to learn, the country\r\nfrom the sea coast to the Alleghany, and from the most southern\r\nwaters of James river up to Patuxen river, now in the State of\r\nMaryland, was occupied by three different nations of Indians,\r\neach of which spoke a different language, and were under separate\r\nand distinct governments. What the original or real names\r\nof those nations were, I have not been able to learn with certainty;\r\nbut by us they are distinguished by the names of Powhatans,\r\nMannahoacs, and Monacans, now commonly called Tuscaroras.\r\nThe Powhatans, who occupied the country from the\r\nsea shore up to the falls of the rivers, were a powerful nation,\r\nand seem to have consisted of seven tribes, five on the western\r\nand two on the eastern shore. Each of these tribes was subdivided\r\ninto towns, families, or clans, who lived together. All\r\nthe nations of Indians in North America lived in the hunter\r\nstate, and depended for subsistence on hunting, fishing, and the\r\nspontaneous fruits of the earth, and a kind of grain which was\r\nplanted and gathered by the women, and is now known by the\r\nname of Indian corn. Long potatoes, pumpkins of various kinds,\r\nand squashes, were also found in use among them. They had\r\nno flocks, herds, or tamed animals of any kind. Their government\r\nis a kind of patriarchal confederacy. Every town or family\r\nhas a chief, who is distinguished by a particular title, and whom\r\nwe commonly call \"Sachem.\" The several towns or families\r\nthat compose a tribe, have a chief who presides over it, and the\r\nseveral tribes composing a nation have a chief who presides over\r\nthe whole nation. These chiefs are generally men advanced in\r\nyears, and distinguished by their prudence and abilities in council.\r\nThe matters which merely regard a town or family are settled\r\nby the chief and principal men of the town; those which\r\nregard a tribe, such as the appointment of head warriors or captains,\r\nand settling differences between different towns and families,\r\nare regulated at a meeting or council of the chiefs from the\r\nseveral towns; and those which regard the whole nation, such as\r\nthe making war, concluding peace, or forming alliances with the\r\nneighboring nations, are deliberated on and determined in a national\r\ncouncil composed of the chiefs of the tribe, attended by\r\nthe head warriors and a number of the chiefs from the towns,\r\nwho are his counsellors. In every town there is a council house,\r\nwhere the chief and old men of the town assemble, when occasion\r\nrequires, and consult what is proper to be done. Every\r\ntribe has a fixed place for the chiefs of the towns to meet and\r\nconsult on the business of the tribe; and in every nation there\r\nis what they call the central council house, or central council\r\nfire, where the chiefs of the several tribes, with the principal\r\nwarriors, convene to consult and determine on their national affairs.\r\nWhen any matter is proposed in the national council, it is\r\ncommon for the chiefs of the several tribes to consult thereon\r\napart with their counsellors, and when they have agreed, to deliver\r\nthe opinion of the tribe at the national council; and, as\r\ntheir government seems to rest wholly on persuasion, they endeavor,\r\nby mutual concessions, to obtain unanimity. Such is\r\nthe government that still subsists among the Indian nations bordering\r\nupon the United States. Some historians seem to think,\r\nthat the dignity of office of Sachem was hereditary. But that\r\nopinion does not appear to be well founded. The sachem or\r\nchief of the tribe seems to be by election. And sometimes persons\r\nwho are strangers, and adopted into the tribe, are promoted\r\nto this dignity, on account of their abilities. Thus on the arrival\r\nof Captain Smith, the first founder of the colony of Virginia,\r\nOpechancanough, who was Sachem or chief of the Chickahominies,\r\none of the tribes of the Powhatans, is said to have\r\nbeen of another tribe, and even of another nation, so that no certain\r\naccount could be obtained of his origin or descent. The\r\nchiefs of the nation seem to have been by a rotation among the\r\ntribes. Thus when Captain Smith, in the year 1609, questioned\r\nPowhatan (who was the chief of the nation, and whose proper\r\nname is said to have been Wahunsonacock) respecting the succession,\r\nthe old chief informed him, \"that he was very old, and\r\nhad seen the death of all his people thrice;[70] that not one of these\r\ngenerations were then living except himself; that he must soon\r\ndie, and the succession descend in order to his brother Opichapan,\r\nOpechancanough, and Catataugh, and then to his two sisters,\r\nand their two daughters.\" But these were appellations designating\r\nthe tribes in the confederacy. For the persons named\r\nare not his real brothers, but the chiefs of different tribes. Accordingly\r\nin 1618, when Powhatan died, he was succeeded by\r\nOpichapan, and after his decease, Opechancanough became chief\r\nof the nation. I need only mention another instance to show\r\nthat the chiefs of the tribes claimed this kindred with the head\r\nof the nation. In 1622, when Raleigh Crashaw was with Japazaw,\r\nthe Sachem or chief of the Potomacs, Opechancanough,\r\nwho had great power and influence, being the second man in\r\nthe nation, and next in succession to Opichapan, and who was\r\na bitter but secret enemy to the English, and wanted to engage\r\nhis nation in a war with them, sent two baskets of beads to the\r\nPotomac chief, and desired him to kill the Englishman that was\r\nwith him. Japazaw replied, that the English were his friends,\r\nand Opichapan his _brother_, and that therefore there should be no\r\nblood shed between them by his means. It is also to be observed,\r\nthat when the English first came over, in all their conferences\r\nwith any of the chiefs, they constantly heard him make\r\nmention of his _brother_, with whom he must consult, or to whom\r\nhe referred them, meaning thereby either the chief of the nation,\r\nor the tribes in confederacy. The Manahoacks are said to have\r\nbeen a confederacy of four tribes, and in alliance with the Monacans,\r\nin the war which they were carrying on against the\r\nPowhatans.\r\n\r\nTo the northward of these there was another powerful nation\r\nwhich occupied the country from the head of the Chesapeake\r\nbay up to the Kittatinney mountain, and as far eastward as Connecticut\r\nriver, comprehending that part of New York which lies\r\nbetween the Highlands and the ocean, all the State of New\r\nJersey, that part of Pennsylvania which is watered, below the\r\nrange of the Kittatinney mountains, by the rivers or streams falling\r\ninto the Delaware, and the county of Newcastle in the State\r\nof Delaware, as far as Duck creek. It is to be observed, that\r\nthe nations of Indians distinguished their countries one from\r\nanother by natural boundaries, such as ranges of mountains or\r\nstreams of water. But as the heads of rivers frequently interlock,\r\nor approach near to each other, as those who live upon a\r\nstream claim the country watered by it, they often encroached\r\non each other, and this is a constant source of war between the\r\ndifferent nations. The nation occupying the tract of country\r\nlast described, called themselves Lenopi. The French writers\r\ncall them Loups; and among the English they are now commonly\r\ncalled Delawares. This nation or confederacy consisted\r\nof five tribes, who all spoke one language. 1. The Chihohocki,\r\nwho dwelt on the west side of the river now called Delaware, a\r\nname which it took from Lord De la War, who put into it on\r\nhis passage from Virginia in the year ----, but which by the\r\nIndians was called Chihohocki. 2. The Wanami, who inhabit\r\nthe country called New Jersey, from the Rariton to the sea. 3.\r\nThe Munsey, who dwelt on the upper streams of the Delaware,\r\nfrom the Kittatinney mountains down to the Lehigh or western\r\nbranch of the Delaware. 4. The Wabinga, who are sometimes\r\ncalled River Indians, sometimes Mohickanders, and who had their\r\ndwelling between the west branch of Delaware and Hudson's river,\r\nfrom the Kittatinney Ridge down to the Rariton; and 5. The\r\nMahiccon, or Manhattan, who occupied Staten Island, York\r\nIsland (which from its being the principal seat of their residence\r\nwas formerly called Manhattan), Long Island, and that part of\r\nNew York and Connecticut which lies between Hudson and\r\nConnecticut rivers, from the highland, which is a continuation\r\nof the Kittatinney Ridge down to the Sound. This nation had\r\na close alliance with the Shawanese, who lived on the Susquehanna\r\nand to the westward of that river, as far as the Alleghany\r\nmountains, and carried on a long war with another powerful nation\r\nor confederacy of Indians, which lived to the north of them\r\nbetween the Kittatinney mountains or highlands, and the Lake\r\nOntario, and who call themselves Mingoes, and are called by the\r\nFrench writers Iroquois, by the English the Five Nations, and\r\nby the Indians to the southward, with whom they were at war,\r\nMassawomacs. This war was carrying on in its greatest fury,\r\nwhen Captain Smith first arrived in Virginia. The Mingo warriors\r\nhad penetrated down the Susquehannah to the mouth of\r\nit. In one of his excursions up the bay, at the mouth of Susquehannah,\r\nin 1608, Captain Smith met with six or seven of\r\ntheir canoes full of warriors, who were coming to attack their\r\nenemies in the rear. In an excursion which he had made a few\r\nweeks before, up the Rappahannock, and in which he had a\r\nskirmish with a party of the Manahoacs, and taken a brother of\r\none of their chiefs prisoner, he first heard of this nation. For\r\nwhen he asked the prisoner why his nation attacked the English?\r\nthe prisoner said, because his nation had heard that the\r\nEnglish came from under the world to take their world from\r\nthem. Being asked, how many worlds he knew? he said, he\r\nknew but one, which was under the sky that covered him, and\r\nwhich consisted of Powhatans, the Manakins, and the Massawomacs.\r\nBeing questioned concerning the latter, he said, they\r\ndwelt on a great water to the North, that they had many boats, and\r\nso many men, that they waged war with all the rest of the world.\r\nThe Mingo confederacy then consisted of five tribes; three who\r\nare the elder, to wit, the Senecas, who live to the West, the Mohawks\r\nto the East, and the Onondagas between them; and two\r\nwho are called the younger tribes, namely, the Cayugas and\r\nOneidas. All these tribes speak one language, and were then\r\nunited in a close confederacy, and occupied the tract of country\r\nfrom the east end of Lake Erie to Lake Champlain, and from\r\nthe Kittatinney and Highlands to the Lake Ontario and the river\r\nCadaraqui, or St. Lawrence. They had some time before that,\r\ncarried on a war with a nation, who lived beyond the lakes, and\r\nwere called Adirondacks. In this war they were worsted; but\r\nhaving made a peace with them, through the intercession of the\r\nFrench who were then settling Canada, they turned their arms\r\nagainst the Lenopi; and as this war was long and doubtful, they,\r\nin the course of it, not only exerted their whole force, but put\r\nin practice every measure which prudence or policy could devise\r\nto bring it to a successful issue. For this purpose they bent\r\ntheir course down the Susquehannah, and warring with the Indians\r\nin their way, and having penetrated as far as the mouth\r\nof it, they, by the terror of their arms, engaged a nation, now\r\nknown by the name of Nanticocks, Conoys, and Tuteloes, and\r\nwho lived between Chesapeake and Delaware bays, and bordering\r\non the tribe of Chihohocki, to enter into an alliance with\r\nthem. They also formed an alliance with the Monicans, and\r\nstimulated them to a war with the Lenopi and their confederates.\r\nAt the same time the Mohawks carried on a furious war\r\ndown the Hudson against the Mohiccons and River Indians, and\r\ncompelled them to purchase a temporary and precarious peace,\r\nby acknowledging them to be their superiors, and paying an annual\r\ntribute. The Lenopi being surrounded with enemies, and\r\nhard pressed, and having lost many of their warriors, were at\r\nlast compelled to sue for peace, which was granted to them on\r\nthe condition that they should put themselves under the protection\r\nof the Mingoes, confine themselves to raising corn, hunting\r\nfor the subsistence of their families, and no longer have the\r\npower of making war. This is what the Indians call making\r\nthem women. And in this condition the Lenopi were when\r\nWilliam Penn first arrived and began the settlement of Pennsylvania\r\nin 1682.\r\n\r\n(6.) p. 342. From the figurative language of the Indians, as\r\nwell as from the practice of those we are still acquainted with,\r\nit is evident that it was and still continues to be, a constant custom\r\namong the Indians to gather up the bones of the dead, and\r\ndeposit them in a particular place. Thus, when they make\r\npeace with any nation with whom they have been at war, after\r\nburying the hatchet, they take up the belt of wampum, and say,\r\n\"We now gather up all the bones of those who have been slain,\r\nand bury them,\" &c. See all the treaties of peace. Besides,\r\nit is customary when any of them die at a distance from home,\r\nto bury them, and afterwards to come and take up the bones\r\nand carry them home. At a treaty which was held at Lancaster\r\nwith the Six Nations, one of them died, and was buried in the\r\nwoods a little distance from the town. Some time after a party\r\ncame and took up the body, separated the flesh from the bones\r\nby boiling and scraping them clean, and carried them to be deposited\r\nin the sepulchres of their ancestors. The operation was\r\nso offensive and disagreeable, that nobody could come near them\r\nwhile they were performing it.\r\n\r\n(7.) p. 350. The Osweàtchies, Connosedàgoes and Cohunnegagoes,\r\nor, as they are commonly called, Caghnewàgos, are of\r\nthe Mingo or Six Nation Indians, who, by the influence of the\r\nFrench missionaries, have been separated from their nation, and\r\ninduced to settle there.\r\n\r\nI do not know of what nation the Augquàgahs are, but suspect\r\nthey are a family of the Senecas.\r\n\r\nThe Nanticocks and Conòies were formerly of a nation that\r\nlived at the head of Chesapeake bay, and who, of late years,\r\nhave been adopted into the Mingo or Iroquois confederacy, and\r\nmake a seventh nation. The Monacans or Tuscaroras, who\r\nwere taken into the confederacy in 1712, making the sixth.\r\n\r\nThe Saponies are families of the Wanamies, who removed\r\nfrom New Jersey, and with the Mohiccons, Munsies, and Delawares,\r\nbelonging to the Lenopi nation. The Mingos are a war\r\ncolony from the Six Nations; so are the Cohunnewagos.\r\n\r\nOf the rest of the Northern tribes I never have been able to\r\nlearn anything certain. But all accounts seem to agree in this,\r\nthat there is a very powerful nation, distinguished by a variety\r\nof names taken from the several towns or families, but commonly\r\ncalled Tàwas or Ottawas, who speak one language, and live\r\nround and on the waters that fall into the western lakes, and extend\r\nfrom the waters of the Ohio quite to the waters falling into\r\nHudson's bay.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [67] Datura pericarpiis erectis ovatis.

The following draught of\r\n     a fundamental Constitution for the Commonwealth of Virginia\r\n     was then prepared, with a design of being proposed in such\r\n     Convention had it taken place.\r\n\r\nTo the citizens of the commonwealth of Virginia, and all\r\nothers whom it may concern, the delegates for the said commonwealth\r\nin Convention assembled, send greeting:\r\n\r\nIt is known to you and to the world, that the government of\r\nGreat Britain, with which the American States were not long\r\nsince connected, assumed over them an authority unwarrantable\r\nand oppressive; that they endeavored to enforce this authority\r\nby arms, and that the States of New Hampshire, Massachusetts,\r\nRhode Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, and Georgia, considering resistance, with all its train\r\nof horrors, as a lesser evil than abject submission, closed in the\r\nappeal to arms. It hath pleased the Sovereign Disposer of all\r\nhuman events to give to this appeal an issue favorable to the\r\nrights of the States; to enable them to reject forever all dependence\r\non a government which had shown itself so capable of\r\nabusing the trusts reposed in it; and to obtain from that government\r\na solemn and explicit acknowledgment that they are free,\r\nsovereign, and independent States. During the progress of that\r\nwar, through which we had to labor for the establishment of our\r\nrights, the legislature of the commonwealth of Virginia found it\r\nnecessary to make a temporary organization of government for\r\npreventing anarchy, and pointing our efforts to the two important\r\nobjects of war against our invaders, and peace and happiness\r\namong ourselves. But this, like all other acts of legislation,\r\nbeing subject to change by subsequent legislatures, possessing\r\nequal powers with themselves; it has been thought expedient,\r\nthat it should receive those amendments which time and trial\r\nhave suggested, and be rendered permanent by a power superior\r\nto that of the ordinary legislature. The general assembly therefore\r\nof this State recommend it to the good people thereof, to\r\nchoose delegates to meet in general convention, with powers to\r\nform a constitution of government for them, and to declare those\r\nfundamentals to which all our laws present and future shall be\r\nsubordinate; and, in compliance with this recommendation, they\r\nhave thought proper to make choice of us, and to vest us with\r\npowers for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, the delegates, chosen by the said good people\r\nof this State for the purpose aforesaid, and now assembled in\r\ngeneral convention, do in execution of the authority with which\r\nwe are invested, establish the following constitution and fundamentals\r\nof government for the said State of Virginia:\r\n\r\nThe said State shall forever hereafter be governed as a commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThe powers of government shall be divided into three distinct\r\ndepartments, each of them to be confided to a separate body of\r\nmagistracy; to wit, those which are legislative to one, those\r\nwhich are judiciary to another, and those which are executive\r\nto another. No person, or collection of persons, being of one\r\nof these departments, shall exercise any power properly belonging\r\nto either of the others, except in the instances hereinafter\r\nexpressly permitted.\r\n\r\nThe legislature shall consist of two branches, the one to be\r\ncalled the House of Delegates, the other the Senate, and both\r\ntogether the General Assembly. The concurrence of both of\r\nthese, expressed on three several readings, shall be necessary to\r\nthe passage of a law.\r\n\r\nDelegates for the general assembly shall be chosen on the last\r\nMonday of November in every year. But if an election cannot\r\nbe concluded on that day, it may be adjourned from day to day\r\ntill it can be concluded.\r\n\r\nThe number of delegates which each county may send shall\r\nbe in proportion to the number of its qualified electors; and the\r\nwhole number of delegates for the State shall be so proportioned\r\nto the whole number of qualified electors in it, that they shall\r\nnever exceed three hundred, nor be fewer than one hundred.\r\nWhenever such excess or deficiency shall take place, the House\r\nof Delegates so deficient or excessive shall, notwithstanding this,\r\ncontinue in being during its legal term; but they shall, during\r\nthat term, re-adjust the proportion, so as to bring their number\r\nwithin the limits before mentioned at the ensuing election. If\r\nany county be reduced in its qualified electors below the number\r\nauthorized to send one delegate, let it be annexed to some\r\nadjoining county.\r\n\r\nFor the election of senators, let the several counties be allotted\r\nby the senate, from time to time, into such and so many districts\r\nas they shall find best; and let each county at the time of electing\r\nits delegates, choose senatorial electors, qualified as themselves\r\nare, and four in number for each delegate their county is\r\nentitled to send, who shall convene, and conduct themselves, in\r\nsuch manner as the legislature shall direct, with the senatorial\r\nelectors from the other counties of their district, and then choose,\r\nby ballot, one senator for every six delegates which their district\r\nis entitled to choose. Let the senatorial districts be divided\r\ninto two classes, and let the members elected for one of\r\nthem be dissolved at the first ensuing general election of delegates,\r\nthe other at the next, and so on alternately forever.\r\n\r\nAll free male citizens, of full age, and sane mind, who for one\r\nyear before shall have been resident in the county, or shall\r\nthrough the whole of that time have possessed therein real property\r\nof the value of ----; or shall for the same time\r\nhave been enrolled in the militia, and no others, shall have a\r\nright to vote for delegates for the said county, and for senatorial\r\nelectors for the district. They shall give their votes personally,\r\nand _vivâ voce_.\r\n\r\nThe general assembly shall meet at the place to which the\r\nlast adjournment was, on the forty-second day after the day of\r\nelection of delegates, and thenceforward at any other time or\r\nplace on their own adjournment, till their office expires, which\r\nshall be on the day preceding that appointed for the meeting of\r\nthe next general assembly. But if they shall at any time adjourn\r\nfor more than one year, it shall be as if they had adjourned\r\nfor one year precisely. Neither house, without the concurrence\r\nof the other, shall adjourn for more than one week, nor to any\r\nother place than the one at which they are sitting. The governor\r\nshall also have power, with the advice of the council of\r\nState, to call them at any other time to the same place, or to a\r\ndifferent one, if that shall have become, since the last adjournment,\r\ndangerous from an enemy, or from infection.\r\n\r\nA majority of either house shall be a quorum, and shall be\r\nrequisite for doing business; but any smaller proportion which\r\nfrom time to time shall be thought expedient by the respective\r\nhouses, shall be sufficient to call for, and to punish, their non-attending\r\nmembers, and to adjourn themselves for any time not\r\nexceeding one week.\r\n\r\nThe members, during their attendance on the general assembly,\r\nand for so long a time before and after as shall be necessary for\r\ntravelling to and from the same, shall be privileged from all personal\r\nrestraint and assault, and shall have no other privilege\r\nwhatsoever. They shall receive during the same time, daily\r\nwages in gold or silver, equal to the value of two bushels of\r\nwheat. This value shall be deemed one dollar by the bushel\r\ntill the year 1790, in which, and in every tenth year thereafter,\r\nthe general court, at their first sessions in the year, shall cause a\r\nspecial jury, of the most respectable merchants and farmers, to\r\nbe summoned, to declare what shall have been the averaged\r\nvalue of wheat during the last ten years; which averaged value\r\nshall be the measure of wages for the ten subsequent years.\r\n\r\nOf this general assembly, the treasurer, attorney general, register,\r\nministers of the gospel, officers of the regular armies of this\r\nState, or of the United States, persons receiving salaries or emoluments\r\nfrom any power foreign to our confederacy, those who\r\nare not resident in the county for which they are chosen delegates,\r\nor districts for which they are chosen senators, those who\r\nare not qualified as electors, persons who shall have committed\r\ntreason, felony, or such other crime as would subject them to infamous\r\npunishment, or who shall have been convicted by due\r\ncourse of law of bribery or corruption, in endeavoring to procure\r\nan election to the said assembly, shall be incapable of being\r\nmembers. All others, not herein elsewhere excluded, who may\r\nelect, shall be capable of being elected thereto.\r\n\r\nAny member of the said assembly accepting any office of profit\r\nunder this State, or the United States, or any of them, shall\r\nthereby vacate his seat, but shall be capable of being re-elected.\r\n\r\nVacancies occasioned by such disqualifications, by death, or\r\notherwise, shall be supplied by the electors, on a writ from the\r\nspeaker of the respective house.\r\n\r\nThe general assembly shall not have power to infringe this\r\nconstitution; to abridge the civil rights of any person on account\r\nof his religious belief; to restrain him from professing and supporting\r\nthat belief, or to compel him to contributions, other than\r\nthose he shall have personally stipulated for the support of that\r\nor any other; to ordain death for any crime but treason or murder,\r\nor military offences; to pardon, or give a power of pardoning\r\npersons duly convicted of treason or felony, but instead thereof\r\nthey may substitute one or two new trials, and no more; to pass\r\nlaws for punishing actions done before the existence of such\r\nlaws; to pass any bill of attainder of treason or felony; to prescribe\r\ntorture in any case whatever; nor to permit the introduction\r\nof any more slaves to reside in this State, or the continuance\r\nof slavery beyond the generation which shall be living on the\r\nthirty-first day of December, one thousand eight hundred; all\r\npersons born after that day being hereby declared free.\r\n\r\nThe general assembly shall have power to sever from this\r\nState all or any parts of its territory westward of the Ohio, or of\r\nthe meridian of the mouth of the Great Kanhaway, and to cede\r\nto Congress one hundred square miles of territory in any other\r\npart of this State, exempted from the jurisdiction and government\r\nof this State so long as Congress shall hold their sessions\r\ntherein, or in any territory adjacent thereto, which may be tendered\r\nto them by any other State.\r\n\r\nThey shall have power to appoint the speakers of their respective\r\nhouses, treasurer, auditors, attorney general, register, all\r\ngeneral officers of the military, their own clerks and serjeants,\r\nand no other officers, except where, in other parts of this constitution,\r\nsuch appointment is expressly given them.\r\n\r\nThe executive powers shall be exercised by a _Governor_, who\r\nshall be chosen by joint ballot of both houses of assembly, and\r\nwhen chosen shall remain in office five years, and be ineligible a\r\nsecond time. During his term he shall hold no other office or\r\nemolument under this State, or any other State or power whatsoever.\r\nBy executive powers, we mean no reference to those\r\npowers exercised under our former government by the crown as\r\nof its prerogative, nor that these shall be the standard of what\r\nmay or may not be deemed the rightful powers of the governor.\r\nWe give him those powers only, which are necessary to execute\r\nthe laws (and administer the government), and which are not in\r\ntheir nature either legislative or judiciary. The application of\r\nthis idea must be left to reason. We do however expressly deny\r\nhim the prerogative powers of erecting courts, offices, boroughs,\r\ncorporations, fairs, markets, ports, beacons, light-houses, and sea-marks;\r\nof laying embargoes, of establishing precedence, of retaining\r\nwithin the State, or recalling to it any citizen thereof,\r\nand of making denizens, except so far as he may be authorized\r\nfrom time to time by the legislature to exercise any of those\r\npowers. The power of declaring war and concluding peace, of\r\ncontracting alliances, of issuing letters of marque and reprisal,\r\nof raising and introducing armed forces, of building armed vessels,\r\nforts, or strongholds, of coining money or regulating its\r\nvalue, of regulating weights and measures, we leave to be exercised\r\nunder the authority of the confederation; but in all cases\r\nrespecting them which are out of the said confederation, they\r\nshall be exercised by the governor, under the regulation of such\r\nlaws as the legislature may think it expedient to pass.\r\n\r\nThe whole military of the State, whether regular, or of\r\nmilitia, shall be subject to his directions; but he shall leave the\r\nexecution of those directions to the general officers appointed by\r\nthe legislature.\r\n\r\nHis salary shall be fixed by the legislature at the session of\r\nthe assembly in which he shall be appointed, and before such\r\nappointment be made; or if it be not then fixed, it shall be the\r\nsame which his next predecessor in office was entitled to. In\r\neither case he may demand it quarterly out of any money which\r\nshall be in the public treasury; and it shall not be in the power\r\nof the legislature to give him less or more, either during his continuance\r\nin office, or after he shall have gone out of it. The\r\nlands, houses, and other things appropriated to the use of the\r\ngovernor, shall remain to his use during his continuance in office.\r\n\r\nA _Council of State_ shall be chosen by joint ballot of both\r\nhouses of assembly, who shall hold their offices seven years, and\r\nbe ineligible a second time, and who, while they shall be of the\r\nsaid council, shall hold no other office or emolument under this\r\nState, or any other State or power whatsoever. Their duty\r\nshall be to attend and advise the governor when called on by\r\nhim, and their advice in any case shall be a sanction to him.\r\nThey shall also have power, and it shall be their duty, to meet\r\nat their own will, and to give their advice, though not required\r\nby the governor, in cases where they shall think the public good\r\ncalls for it. Their advice and proceedings shall be entered in\r\nbooks to be kept for that purpose, and shall be signed as approved\r\nor disapproved by the members present. These books shall be\r\nlaid before either house of assembly when called for by them.\r\nThe said council shall consist of eight members for the present;\r\nbut their numbers may be increased or reduced by the legislature,\r\nwhenever they shall think it necessary; provided such reduction\r\nbe made only as the appointments become vacant by death, resignation,\r\ndisqualification, or regular deprivation. A majority of\r\ntheir actual number, and not fewer, shall be a quorum. They\r\nshall be allowed for the present ---- each by the year, payable\r\nquarterly out of any money which shall be in the public treasury.\r\nTheir salary, however, may be increased or abated from\r\ntime to time, at the discretion of the legislature; provided such\r\nincrease or abatement shall not, by any ways or means, be made\r\nto affect either then, or at any future time, any one of those then\r\nactually in office. At the end of each quarter their salary shall\r\nbe divided into equal portions by the number of days on which,\r\nduring that quarter, a council has been held, or required by the\r\ngovernor, or by their own adjournment, and one of those portions\r\nshall be withheld from each member for every of the said\r\ndays which, without cause allowed good by the board, he failed\r\nto attend, or departed before adjournment without their leave.\r\nIf no board should have been held during that quarter, there\r\nshall be no deduction.\r\n\r\nThey shall annually choose a _President_, who shall preside in\r\ncouncil in the absence of the governor, and who, in case of his\r\noffice becoming vacant by death or otherwise, shall have authority\r\nto exercise all his functions, till a new appointment be\r\nmade, as he shall also in any interval during which the governor\r\nshall declare himself unable to attend to the duties of his office.\r\n\r\nThe _Judiciary_ powers shall be exercised by county courts\r\nand such other inferior courts as the legislature shall think proper\r\nto continue or to erect, by three superior courts, to wit, a Court\r\nof Admiralty, a general Court of Common Law, and a High\r\nCourt of Chancery; and by one Supreme Court, to be called the\r\nCourt of Appeals.\r\n\r\nThe judges of the high court of chancery, general court, and\r\ncourt of admiralty, shall be four in number each, to be appointed\r\nby joint ballot of both houses of assembly, and to hold their\r\noffices during good behavior. While they continue judges, they\r\nshall hold no other office or emolument, under this State, or any\r\nother State or power whatsoever, except that they may be delegated\r\nto Congress, receiving no additional allowance.\r\n\r\nThese judges, assembled together, shall constitute the Court\r\nof Appeals, whose business shall be to receive and determine appeals\r\nfrom the three superior courts, but to receive no original\r\ncauses, except in the cases expressly permitted herein.\r\n\r\nA majority of the members of either of these courts, and not\r\nfewer, shall be a quorum. But in the Court of Appeals nine\r\nmembers shall be necessary to do business. Any smaller numbers\r\nhowever may be authorized by the legislature to adjourn\r\ntheir respective courts.\r\n\r\nThey shall be allowed for the present ---- each by the year,\r\npayable quarterly out of any money which shall be in the public\r\ntreasury. Their salaries, however, may be increased or abated,\r\nfrom time to time, at the discretion of the legislature, provided\r\nsuch increase or abatement shall not by any ways or means, be\r\nmade to affect, either then, or at any future time, any one of\r\nthose then actually in office. At the end of each quarter their\r\nsalary shall be divided into equal portions by the number of days\r\non which, during that quarter, their respective courts sat, or should\r\nhave sat, and one of these portions shall be withheld from each\r\nmember for every of the said days which, without cause allowed\r\ngood by his court, he failed to attend, or departed before adjournment\r\nwithout their leave. If no court should have been\r\nheld during the quarter, there shall be no deduction.\r\n\r\nThere shall, moreover, be a _Court of Impeachments_, to consist\r\nof three members of the Council of State, one of each of the superior\r\ncourts of Chancery, Common Law, and Admiralty, two\r\nmembers of the house of delegates and one of the Senate, to be\r\nchosen by the body respectively of which they are. Before\r\nthis court any member of the three branches of government, that\r\nis to say, the governor, any member of the council, of the two\r\nhouses of legislature, or of the superior courts, may be impeached\r\nby the governor, the council, or either of the said houses or\r\ncourts, and by no other, for such misbehavior in office as would\r\nbe sufficient to remove him therefrom; and the only sentence\r\nthey shall have authority to pass shall be that of deprivation and\r\nfuture incapacity of office. Seven members shall be requisite to\r\nmake a court, and two-thirds of those present must concur in the\r\nsentence. The offences cognizable by this court shall be cognizable\r\nby no other, and they shall be triers of the fact as well\r\nas judges of the law.\r\n\r\nThe justices or judges of the inferior courts already erected,\r\nor hereafter to be erected, shall be appointed by the governor, on\r\nadvice of the council of State, and shall hold their offices during\r\ngood behavior, or the existence of their courts. For breach\r\nof the good behavior, they shall be tried according to the laws\r\nof the land, before the Court of Appeals, who shall be judges of\r\nthe fact as well as of the law. The only sentence they shall\r\nhave authority to pass shall be that of deprivation and future incapacity\r\nof office, and two-thirds of the members present must\r\nconcur in this sentence.\r\n\r\nAll courts shall appoint their own clerks, who shall hold their\r\noffices during good behavior, or the existence of their court;\r\nthey shall also appoint all other attending officers to continue\r\nduring their pleasure. Clerks appointed by the supreme or superior\r\ncourts shall be removable by their respective courts.\r\nThose to be appointed by other courts shall have been previously\r\nexamined, and certified to be duly qualified, by some two\r\nmembers of the general court, and shall be removable for breach\r\nof the good behavior by the Court of Appeals only, who shall\r\nbe judges of the fact as well as of the law. Two-thirds of the\r\nmembers present must concur in the sentence.\r\n\r\nThe justices or judges of the inferior courts may be members\r\nof the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe judgment of no inferior court shall be final, in any civil\r\ncase, of greater value than fifty bushels of wheat, as last rated\r\nin the general court for setting the allowance to the members\r\nof the general assembly, nor in any case of treason, felony, or other\r\ncrime which should subject the party to infamous punishment.\r\n\r\nIn all causes depending before any court, other than those of\r\nimpeachments, of appeals, and military courts, facts put in issue\r\nshall be tried by jury, and in all courts whatever witnesses shall\r\ngive testimony _vivâ voce_ in open court, wherever their attendance\r\ncan be procured; and all parties shall be allowed counsel\r\nand compulsory process for their witnesses.\r\n\r\nFines, amercements, and terms of imprisonment left indefinite\r\nby the law, other than for contempts, shall be fixed by the jury,\r\ntriers of the offence.\r\n\r\nThe governor, two councillors of State, and a judge from each\r\nof the superior Courts of Chancery, Common Law, and Admiralty,\r\nshall be a council to revise all bills which shall have\r\npassed both houses of assembly, in which council the governor,\r\nwhen present, shall preside. Every bill, before it becomes a law,\r\nshall be represented to this council, who shall have a right to advise\r\nits rejection, returning the bill, with their advice and reasons\r\nin writing, to the house in which it originated, who shall proceed\r\nto reconsider the said bill. But if after such reconsideration,\r\ntwo-thirds of the house shall be of opinion that the bill should\r\npass finally, they shall pass and send it, with the advice and\r\nwritten reasons of the said Council of Revision, to the other\r\nhouse, wherein if two-thirds also shall be of opinion it should\r\npass finally, it shall thereupon become law; otherwise it shall\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nIf any bill, presented to the said council, be not, within one\r\nweek (exclusive of the day of presenting it) returned by them,\r\nwith their advice of rejection and reasons, to the house wherein\r\nit originated, or to the clerk of the said house, in case of its adjournment\r\nover the expiration of the week, it shall be law from\r\nthe expiration of the week, and shall then be demandable by\r\nthe clerk of the House of Delegates, to be filed of record in his\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nThe bills which they approve shall become law from the time\r\nof such approbation, and shall then be returned to, or demandable\r\nby, the clerk of the House of Delegates, to be filed of record\r\nin his office.\r\n\r\nA bill rejected on advice of the Council of Revision may\r\nagain be proposed, during the same session of assembly, with\r\nsuch alterations as will render it conformable to their advice.\r\n\r\nThe members of the said Council of Revision shall be appointed\r\nfrom time to time by the board or court of which they\r\nrespectively are. Two of the executive and two of the judiciary\r\nmembers shall be requisite to do business; and to prevent the\r\nevils of non-attendance, the board and courts may at any time\r\nname all, or so many as they will, of their members, in the particular\r\norder in which they would choose the duty of attendance\r\nto devolve from preceding to subsequent members, the preceding\r\nfailing to attend. They shall have additionally for their services\r\nin this council the same allowance as members of assembly have.\r\n\r\nThe confederation is made a part of this constitution, subject\r\nto such future alterations as shall be agreed to by the legislature\r\nof this State, and by all the other confederating States.\r\n\r\nThe delegates to Congress shall be five in number; any three\r\nof whom, and no fewer, may be a representation. They shall\r\nbe appointed by joint ballot of both houses of assembly for any\r\nterm not exceeding one year, subject to be recalled, within the\r\nterm, by joint vote of both the said houses. They may at the\r\nsame time be members of the legislative or judiciary departments,\r\nbut not of the executive.\r\n\r\nThe benefits of the writ of Habeas Corpus shall be extended,\r\nby the legislature, to every person within this State, and without\r\nfee, and shall be so facilitated that no person may be detained in\r\nprison more than ten days after he shall have demanded and\r\nbeen refused such writ by the judge appointed by law, or if none\r\nbe appointed, then by any judge of a superior court, nor more\r\nthan ten days after such writ shall have been served on the person\r\ndetaining him, and no order given, on due examination, for\r\nhis remandment or discharge.\r\n\r\nThe military shall be subordinate to the civil power.\r\n\r\nPrinting presses shall be subject to no other restraint than\r\nliableness to legal prosecution for false facts printed and published.\r\n\r\nAny two of the three branches of government concurring in\r\nopinion, each by the voice of two-thirds of their whole existing\r\nnumber, that a convention is necessary for altering this constitution,\r\nor correcting breaches of it, they shall be authorized to\r\nissue writs to every county for the election of so many delegates\r\nas they are authorized to send to the general assembly, which\r\nelections shall be held, and writs returned, as the laws shall have\r\nprovided in the case of elections of delegates of assembly, _mutatis mutandis_,\r\nand the said delegates shall meet at the usual\r\nplace of holding assemblies, three months after date of such\r\nwrits, and shall be acknowledged to have equal powers with this\r\npresent convention. The said writs shall be signed by all the\r\nmembers approving the same.\r\n\r\n_To introduce this government_, the following special and temporary\r\nprovision is made.\r\n\r\nThis convention being authorized only to amend those laws\r\nwhich constituted the form of government, no general dissolution\r\nof the whole system of laws can be supposed to have taken\r\nplace; but all laws in force at the meeting of this convention,\r\nand not inconsistent with this constitution, remain in full force,\r\nsubject to alterations by the ordinary legislature.\r\n\r\nThe present general assembly shall continue till the forty-second\r\nday after the last Monday of November in this present year.\r\nOn the said last Monday of November in this present year, the\r\nseveral counties shall by their electors qualified as provided\r\nby this constitution, elect delegates, which for the present shall\r\nbe, in number, one for every ---- militia of the said county,\r\naccording to the latest returns in possession of the governor,\r\nand shall also choose senatorial electors in proportion thereto,\r\nwhich senatorial electors shall meet on the fourteenth day\r\nafter the day of their election, at the court house of that county\r\nof their present district which would stand first in an alphabetical\r\narrangement of their counties, and shall choose senators in\r\nthe proportion fixed by this constitution. The elections and returns\r\nshall be conducted, in all circumstances not hereby particularly\r\nprescribed, by the same persons and under the same\r\nforms as prescribed by the present laws in elections of senators\r\nand delegates of assembly. The said senators and delegates\r\nshall constitute the first general assembly of the new government,\r\nand shall specially apply themselves to the procuring an\r\nexact return from every county of the number of its qualified\r\nelectors, and to the settlement of the number of delegates to be\r\nelected for the ensuing general assembly.\r\n\r\nThe present governor shall continue in office to the end of the\r\nterm for which he was elected.\r\n\r\nAll other officers of every kind shall continue in office as they\r\nwould have done had their appointment been under this constitution,\r\nand new ones, where new are hereby called for, shall be\r\nappointed by the authority to which such appointment is referred.\r\nOne of the present judges of the general court, he consenting\r\nthereto, shall by joint ballot of both houses of assembly,\r\nat their first meeting, be transferred to the High Court of Chancery.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo. III.\r\n\r\n     An Act for establishing Religious Freedom, passed in the\r\n     Assembly of Virginia in the beginning of the year 1786.\r\n\r\nWell aware that Almighty God hath created the mind free;\r\nthat all attempts to influence it by temporal punishments or burdens,\r\nor by civil incapacitations, tend only to beget habits of\r\nhypocrisy and meanness, and are a departure from the plan of\r\nthe Holy Author of our religion, who being Lord both of body\r\nand mind, yet chose not to propagate it by coercions on either,\r\nas was in his Almighty power to do; that the impious presumption\r\nof legislators and rulers, civil as well as ecclesiastical, who,\r\nbeing themselves but fallible and uninspired men have assumed\r\ndominion over the faith of others, setting up their own opinions\r\nand modes of thinking as the only true and infallible, and as\r\nsuch endeavoring to impose them on others, hath established\r\nand maintained false religions over the greatest part of the\r\nworld, and through all time; that to compel a man to furnish\r\ncontributions of money for the propagation of opinions which he\r\ndisbelieves, is sinful and tyrannical; that even the forcing him\r\nto support this or that teacher of his own religious persuasion, is\r\ndepriving him of the comfortable liberty of giving his contributions\r\nto the particular pastor whose morals he would make his\r\npattern, and whose powers he feels most persuasive to righteousness,\r\nand is withdrawing from the ministry those temporal rewards,\r\nwhich proceeding from an approbation of their personal\r\nconduct, are an additional incitement to earnest and unremitting\r\nlabors for the instruction of mankind; that our civil rights\r\nhave no dependence on our religious opinions, more than our\r\nopinions in physics or geometry; that, therefore, the proscribing\r\nany citizen as unworthy the public confidence by laying\r\nupon him an incapacity of being called to the offices of trust\r\nand emolument, unless he profess or renounce this or that religious\r\nopinion, is depriving him injuriously of those privileges\r\nand advantages to which in common with his fellow citizens he\r\nhas a natural right; that it tends also to corrupt the principles\r\nof that very religion it is meant to encourage, by bribing, with a\r\nmonopoly of worldly honors and emoluments, those who will\r\nexternally profess and conform to it; that though indeed these\r\nare criminal who do not withstand such temptation, yet neither\r\nare those innocent who lay the bait in their way; that to suffer\r\nthe civil magistrate to intrude his powers into the field of opinion\r\nand to restrain the profession or propagation of principles, on\r\nthe supposition of their ill tendency, is a dangerous fallacy, which\r\nat once destroys all religious liberty, because he being of course\r\njudge of that tendency, will make his opinions the rule of judgment,\r\nand approve or condemn the sentiments of others only as\r\nthey shall square with or differ from his own; that it is time\r\nenough for the rightful purposes of civil government, for its officers\r\nto interfere when principles break out into overt acts\r\nagainst peace and good order; and finally, that truth is great and\r\nwill prevail if left to herself, that she is the proper and sufficient\r\nantagonist to error, and has nothing to fear from the conflict,\r\nunless by human interposition disarmed of her natural weapons,\r\nfree argument and debate, errors ceasing to be dangerous when\r\nit is permitted freely to contradict them.\r\n\r\n_Be it therefore enacted by the General Assembly_, That no\r\nman shall be compelled to frequent or support any religious worship,\r\nplace or ministry whatsoever, nor shall be enforced, restrained,\r\nmolested, or burthened in his body or goods, nor shall\r\notherwise suffer on account of his religious opinions or belief;\r\nbut that all men shall be free to profess, and by argument to\r\nmaintain, their opinions in matters of religion, and that the\r\nsame shall in nowise diminish, enlarge, or affect their civil capacities.\r\n\r\nAnd though we well know this Assembly, elected by the people\r\nfor the ordinary purposes of legislation only, have no power\r\nto restrain the acts of succeeding assemblies, constituted with the\r\npowers equal to our own, and that therefore to declare this act\r\nirrevocable, would be of no effect in law, yet we are free to declare,\r\nand do declare, that the rights hereby asserted are of the\r\nnatural rights of mankind, and that if any act shall be hereafter\r\npassed to repeal the present or to narrow its operation, such act\r\nwill be an infringement of natural right.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN APPENDIX\r\n\r\nRELATIVE TO THE MURDER OF LOGAN'S FAMILY.[71]\r\n\r\nThe \"Notes on Virginia\" were written, in Virginia, in the\r\nyears 1781 and 1782, in answer to certain queries proposed to\r\nme by Monsieur de Marbois, then secretary of the French legation\r\nin the United States; and a manuscript copy was delivered\r\nto him. A few copies, with some additions, were afterwards,\r\nin 1784, printed in Paris, and given to particular friends.\r\nIn speaking of the animals of America, the theory of M. de Buffon,\r\nthe Abbe Raynal, and others presented itself to consideration.\r\nThey have supposed there is something in the soil, climate, and\r\nother circumstances of America, which occasions animal nature\r\nto degenerate, not excepting even the man, native or adoptive,\r\nphysical or moral. This theory, so unfounded and degrading to\r\none-third of the globe, was called to the bar of fact and reason.\r\nAmong other proofs adduced in contradiction of this hypothesis,\r\nthe speech of Logan, an Indian chief, delivered to Lord Dunmore\r\nin 1774, was produced, as a specimen of the talents of the\r\naboriginals of this country, and particularly of their eloquence;\r\nand it was believed that Europe had never produced anything\r\nsuperior to this morsel of eloquence. In order to make it intelligible\r\nto the reader, the transaction, on which it was founded,\r\nwas stated, as it had been generally related in America at the\r\ntime, and as I had heard it myself, in the circle of Lord Dunmore,\r\nand the officers who accompanied him; and the speech itself\r\nwas given as it had, ten years before the printing of that\r\nbook, circulated in the newspapers through all the then colonies,\r\nthrough the magazines of Great Britain, and periodical publications\r\nof Europe. For three and twenty years it passed uncontradicted;\r\nnor was it ever suspected that it even admitted contradiction.\r\nIn 1797, however, for the first time, not only the\r\nwhole transaction respecting Logan was affirmed in the public\r\npapers to be false, but the speech itself suggested to be a forgery,\r\nand even a forgery of mine, to aid me in proving that the man\r\nof America was equal in body and in mind, to the man of Europe.\r\nBut wherefore the forgery; whether Logan's or mine, it\r\nwould still have been American. I should indeed consult my\r\nown fame if the suggestion, that this speech is mine, were suffered\r\nto be believed. He would have just right to be proud who\r\ncould with truth claim that composition. But it is none of mine;\r\nand I yield it to whom it is due.\r\n\r\nOn seeing then that this transaction was brought into question,\r\nI thought it my duty to make particular inquiry into its\r\nfoundation. It was the more my duty, as it was alleged that,\r\nby ascribing to an individual therein named, a participation in\r\nthe murder of Logan's family, I had done an injury to his character,\r\nwhich it had not deserved. I had no knowledge personally\r\nof that individual. I had no reason to aim an injury at\r\nhim. I only repeated what I had heard from others, and what\r\nthousands had heard and believed as well as myself; and which\r\nno one indeed, till then, had been known to question. Twenty-three\r\nyears had now elapsed, since the transaction took place.\r\nMany of those acquainted with it were dead, and the living dispersed\r\nto very distant parts of the earth. Few of them were\r\neven known to me. To those however of whom I knew, I\r\nmade application by letter; and some others, moved by a regard\r\nfor truth and justice, were kind enough to come forward, of\r\nthemselves, with their testimony. These fragments of evidence,\r\nthe small remains of a mighty mass which time has consumed,\r\nare here presented to the public, in the form of letters, certificates,\r\nor affidavits, as they came to me. I have rejected none\r\nof these forms, nor required other solemnities from those whose\r\nmotives and characters were pledges of their truth. Historical\r\ntransactions are deemed to be well vouched by the simple declarations\r\nof those who have borne a part in them; and especially\r\nof persons having no interest to falsify or disfigure them. The\r\nworld will now see whether they, or I, have injured Cresap, by\r\nbelieving Logan's charge against him; and they will decide between\r\nLogan and Cresap, whether Cresap was innocent, and Logan\r\na calumniator?\r\n\r\nIn order that the reader may have a clear conception of the\r\ntransactions, to which the different parts of the following declarations\r\nrefer, he must take notice that they establish four different\r\nmurders. 1. Of two Indians, a little above Wheeling. 2.\r\nOf others at Grave Creek, among whom were some of Logan's\r\nrelations. 3. The massacre at Baker's bottom, on the Ohio, opposite\r\nthe mouth of Yellow Creek, where were other relations\r\nof Logan. 4. Of those killed at the same place, coming in\r\ncanoes to the relief of their friends. I place the numbers 1, 2,\r\n3, 4, against certain paragraphs of the evidence, to indicate the\r\nparticular murder to which the paragraph relates, and present\r\nalso a small sketch or map of the principal scenes of these butcheries,\r\nfor their more ready comprehension.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Extract of a letter from the Honorable Judge Innes, of\r\n     Frankfort in Kentucky, to Thomas Jefferson, dated Kentucky,\r\n     near Frankfort, March 2d, 1799._\r\n\r\nI recollect to have seen Logan's speech in 1775, in one of the public\r\nprints. That Logan conceived Cresap to be the author of the murder at\r\nYellow Creek, it is in my power to give, perhaps, a more particular\r\ninformation, than any other person you can apply to.\r\n\r\nIn 1774 I lived in Fincastle county, now divided into Washington,\r\nMontgomery and part of Wythe. Being intimate in Col. Preston's family,\r\nI happened in July to be at his house, when an express was sent to him\r\nas County Lieut. requesting a guard of the militia to be ordered out for\r\nthe protection of the inhabitants residing low down on the north fork of\r\nHolston river. The express brought with him a War Club, and a note which\r\nwas left tied to it at the house of one Robertson, whose family were cut\r\noff by the Indians, and gave rise for the application to Col. Preston,\r\nof which the following is a copy, then taken by me in my memorandum book.\r\n\r\n     \"Captain Cresap,--What did you kill my people on Yellow Creek\r\n     for? The white people killed my kin at Conestoga, a great\r\n     while ago; and I thought nothing of that. But you killed my\r\n     kin again, on Yellow Creek, and took my Cousin Prisoner. Then\r\n     I thought I must kill too; and I have been three times to war\r\n     since; but the Indians are not angry; only myself.\r\n\r\n     \"July 21st, 1774.                       Captain JOHN LOGAN.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWith great respect, I am, Dear Sir, your most obedient servant,\r\n                                                          HARRY INNES.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Alleghany County, ss. }\r\n     State of Pennsylvania.}\r\n\r\nBefore me, the subscriber, a justice of the peace in and for said county,\r\npersonally appeared John Gibson, Esquire, an associate Judge of same\r\ncounty, who being duly sworn, deposeth and saith that he traded with\r\nthe Shawanese and other tribes of Indians then settled on the Siota in\r\nthe year 1773, and in the beginning of the year 1774, and that in the\r\nmonth of April of the same year, he left the same Indian towns, and\r\ncame to this place, in order to procure some goods and provisions, that\r\nhe remained here only a few days, and then set out in company with a\r\ncertain Alexander Blaine and M. Elliot by water to return to the towns\r\non the Siota, and that one evening as they were drifting in their canoes\r\nnear the Long Reach on the Ohio, they were hailed by a number of white\r\nmen on the South West shore, who requested them to put ashore, as they\r\nhad disagreeable news to inform them of; that we then landed on shore;\r\nand found amongst the party, a Major Angus M'Donald from West Chester,\r\na Doctor Woods from same place, and a party as they said of one hundred\r\nand fifty men. We then asked the news. They informed us that some of the\r\nparty who had been taken up, and improving lands near the Big Kanhawa\r\nriver, had seen another party of white men, who informed them that they\r\nand some others had fell in with a party of Shawanese, who had been\r\nhunting on the South West side of the Ohio, that they had killed the whole\r\nof the Indian party, and that the others had gone across the country to\r\nCheat river with the horses and plunder, the consequence of which they\r\napprehended would be an Indian war, and that they were flying away. On\r\nmaking inquiry of them when this murder should have happened, we found\r\nthat it must have been some considerable time before we left the Indian\r\ntowns, and that there was not the smallest foundation for the report,\r\nas there was not a single man of the Shawanese, but what returned from\r\nhunting long before this should have happened.\r\n\r\nWe then informed them that if they would agree to remain at the place\r\nwe then were, one of us would go to Hock Hocking river with some of\r\ntheir party, where we should find some of our people making canoes, and\r\nthat if we did not find them there, we might conclude that everything\r\nwas not right. Doctor Wood and another person then proposed going with\r\nme; the rest of the party seemed to agree, but said they would send and\r\nconsult Captain Cresap, who was about two miles from that place. They\r\nsent off for him, and during the greatest part of the night they behaved\r\nin the most disorderly manner, threatening to kill us, and saying the\r\ndamned traders were worse than the Indians and ought to be killed. In\r\nthe morning Captain Michael Cresap came to the camp. I then gave him\r\nthe information as above related. They then met in council, and after an\r\nhour or more Captain Cresap returned to me, and informed that he could\r\nnot prevail on them to adopt the proposal I had made to them, that as he\r\nhad a great regard for Captain R. Callender, a brother-in-law of mine\r\nwith whom I was connected in trade, he advised me by no means to think\r\nof proceeding any further, as he was convinced the present party would\r\nfall on and kill every Indian they met on the river, that for his part\r\nhe should not continue with them, but go right across the country to\r\nRed-Stone to avoid the consequences. That we then proceeded to Hocking\r\nand went up the same to the canoe place where we found our people at\r\nwork, and after some days we proceeded to the towns on Siota by land.\r\nOn our arrival there, we heard of the different murders committed by\r\nthe party on their way up the Ohio.\r\n\r\nThis Deponent further saith that in the year 1774, he accompanied Lord\r\nDunmore on the expedition against the Shawanese and other Indians on the\r\nSiota, that on their arrival within fifteen miles of the towns, they were\r\nmet by a flag, and a white man of the name of Elliot, who informed Lord\r\nDunmore that the Chiefs of the Shawanese had sent to request his Lordship\r\nto halt his army and send in some person, who understood their language;\r\nthat this Deponent, at the request of Lord Dunmore and the whole of the\r\nofficers with him, went in; that on his arrival at the towns, Logan, the\r\nIndian, came to where the deponent was sitting with the Corn-Stalk, and\r\nthe other chiefs of the Shawanese, and asked him to walk out with him;\r\nthat they went into a copse of wood, where they sat down, when Logan,\r\nafter shedding abundance of tears, delivered to him the speech, nearly\r\nas related by Mr. Jefferson in his notes on the State of Virginia; that\r\nhe the deponent told him that it was not Col. Cresap who had murdered\r\nhis relations, and that although his son Captain Michael Cresap was with\r\nthe party who killed a Shawanese chief and other Indians, yet he was\r\nnot present when his relations were killed at Baker's, near the mouth\r\nof Yellow Creek on the Ohio; that this Deponent on his return to camp\r\ndelivered the speech to Lord Dunmore; and that the murders perpetrated\r\nas above were considered as ultimately the cause of the war of 1774,\r\ncommonly called Cresap's war.\r\n\r\n                                                          JOHN GIBSON.\r\n\r\n     Sworn and subscribed the 4th April, 1800, at Pittsburg, before\r\n     me,\r\n\r\n                                                          JER. BARKER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _Extract of a letter from Col. Ebenezer Zane, to the honorable\r\n     John Brown, one of the senators in Congress from Kentucky;\r\n     dated Wheeling, Feb. 4th, 1800._\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 1]\r\n\r\nI was myself, with many others, in the practice of making improvements\r\non lands upon the Ohio, for the purpose of acquiring rights to the same.\r\nBeing on the Ohio at the mouth of Sandy Creek, in company with many\r\nothers, news circulated that the Indians had robbed some of the Land\r\njobbers. This news induced the people generally to ascend the Ohio. I\r\nwas among the number. On our arrival at the Wheeling, being informed\r\nthat there were two Indians with some traders near and above Wheeling,\r\na proposition was made by the then Captain Michael Cresap to waylay\r\nand kill the Indians upon the river. This measure I opposed with much\r\nviolence, alleging that the killing of those Indians might involve the\r\ncountry in a war. But the opposite party prevailed, and proceeded up\r\nthe Ohio with Captain Cresap at their head.\r\n\r\nIn a short time the party returned, and also the traders, in a canoe;\r\nbut there were no Indians in the company. I inquired what had become of\r\nthe Indians, and was informed by the traders and Cresap's party that they\r\nhad fallen overboard. I examined the canoe, and saw much fresh blood and\r\nsome bullet holes in the canoe. This fully convinced me that the party\r\nhad killed the two Indians, and thrown them into the river.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 2]\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of the day this action happened, a report prevailed that\r\nthere was a camp, or party of Indians on the Ohio below and near the\r\nWheeling. In consequence of this information, Captain Cresap with his\r\nparty, joined by a number of recruits, proceeded immediately down the\r\nOhio for the purpose, as was then generally understood, of destroying\r\nthe Indians above mentioned. On the succeeding day, Captain Cresap and\r\nhis party returned to Wheeling, and it was generally reported by the\r\nparty that they had killed a number of Indians. Of the truth of this\r\nreport I had no doubt, as one of Cresap's party was badly wounded, and\r\nthe party had a fresh scalp, and a quantity of property, which they\r\ncalled Indian plunder. At the time of the last-mentioned transaction,\r\nit was generally reported that the party of Indians down the Ohio were\r\nLogan and his family; but I have reason to believe that this report was\r\nunfounded.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 3]\r\n\r\nWithin a few days after the transaction above mentioned, a party of\r\nIndians were killed at Yellow Creek. But I must do the memory of Captain\r\nCresap the justice to say that I do not believe that he was present at\r\nthe killing of the Indians at Yellow Creek. But there is not the least\r\ndoubt in my mind, that the massacre at Yellow Creek was brought on by\r\nthe two transactions first stated.\r\n\r\nAll the transactions, which I have related happened in the latter end of\r\nApril 1774; and there can scarcely be a doubt that they were the cause\r\nof the war which immediately followed, commonly called Dunmore's War.\r\n\r\n     I am with much esteem, yours, &c,\r\n\r\n                                                        EBENEZER ZANE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _The certificate of William Huston of Washington county, in\r\n     the State of Pennsylvania, communicated by David Riddick,\r\n     Esquire, Prothonotary of Washington county, Pennsylvania; who\r\n     in the letter enclosing it says \"Mr. William Huston is a man\r\n     of established reputation in point of integrity.\"_\r\n\r\nI William Huston of Washington county, in the State of Pennsylvania, do\r\nhereby certify to whom it may concern, that in the year 1774, I resided\r\nat Catfishes camp, on the main path from Wheeling to Redstone; that\r\nMichael Cresap, who resided on or near the Potomac river, on his way up\r\nfrom the river Ohio, at the head of a party of armed men, lay some time\r\nat my cabin.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 2]\r\n\r\nI had previously heard the report of Mr. Cresap having killed some\r\nIndians, said to be the relations of \"Logan\" an Indian Chief. In a\r\nvariety of conversations with several of Cresap's party, they boasted\r\nof the deed; and that in the presence of their chief. They acknowledged\r\nthey had fired first on the Indians. They had with them one man on a\r\nlitter, who was in the skirmish.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 3]\r\n\r\nI do further certify that, from what I learned from the party themselves,\r\nI then formed the opinion, and have not had any reason to change the\r\nopinion since, that the killing, on the part of the whites, was what I\r\ndeem the grossest murder. I further certify that some of the party, who\r\nafterwards killed some women and other Indians at Baker's bottom, also\r\nlay at my cabin, on their march to the interior part of the country;\r\nthey had with them a little girl, whose life had been spared by the\r\ninterference of some more humane than the rest.

The deponent refused\r\nhaving any hand in killing unoffending people. His companion, King, went\r\nwith Great-house, with divers others, some of whom had been collected\r\nat a considerable distance under an idea that Joshua Baker's family was\r\nin danger from the Indians, as war had been commenced between Cresap\r\nand them already; that Edward King, as well as others of the party,\r\ndid not conceal from the deponent the most minute circumstances of this\r\naffair; they informed him that Great-house, concealing his people, went\r\nover to the Indian encampments and counted their number, and found that\r\nthey were too large a party to attack with his strength; that he then\r\nrequested Joshua Baker, when any of them came to his house, (which they\r\nhad been in the habit of,) to give them what rum they could drink, and\r\nto let him know when they were in a proper train, and that he would\r\nthen fall on them; that accordingly they found several men and women at\r\nBaker's house; that one of these women had cautioned Great-house, when\r\nover in the Indian camp, that he had better return home, as the Indian\r\nmen were drinking, and that having heard of Cresap's attack on their\r\nrelations down the river, they were angry, and, in a friendly manner,\r\ntold him to go home. Great-house, with his party, fell on them, and\r\nkilled all except a little girl, which the deponent saw with the party\r\nafter the slaughter; that the Indians in the camp hearing the firing,\r\nmanned two canoes, supposing their friends at Baker's to be attacked, as\r\nwas supposed; the party under Great-house prevented their landing by a\r\nwell-directed fire, which did execution in the canoes; that Edward King\r\nshowed the deponent one of the scalps. The deponent further saith, that\r\nthe settlements near the river broke up, and he the deponent immediately\r\nrepaired to Catfish's camp, and lived some time with Mr. William Huston;\r\nthat not long after his arrival, Cresap, with his party, returning from\r\nthe Ohio, came to Mr. Huston's and tarried some time; that in various\r\nconversations with the party, and in particular with a Mr. Smith, who\r\nhad one arm only, he was told that the Indians were acknowledged and\r\nknown to be Logan's friends which they had killed, and that he heard\r\nthe party say, that Logan would probably avenge their deaths.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 2]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 3]\r\n\r\nThey acknowledged that the Indians passed Cresap's encampment on the bank\r\nof the river in a peaceable manner, and encamped below him; that they\r\nwent down and fired on the Indians and killed several; that the survivors\r\nflew to their arms and fired on Cresap, and wounded one man, whom the\r\ndeponent saw carried on a litter by the party; that the Indians killed\r\nby Cresap were not only Logan's relations, but of the women killed at\r\nBaker's one was said and generally believed to be Logan's sister. The\r\ndeponent further saith, that on the relation of the attack by Cresap\r\non the unoffending Indians, he exclaimed in their hearing, that it was\r\nan atrocious murder; on which Mr. Smith threatened the deponent with\r\nthe tomahawk; so that he was obliged to be cautious, fearing an injury,\r\nas the party appeared to have lost, in a great degree, sentiments of\r\nhumanity as well as the effects of civilization.

Michael Cresap with the\r\nmurder of his family; that on his arrival in the town, which was on the\r\n18th of July, he was tied to a stake and a great debate arose whether he\r\nshould not be burnt; Logan insisted on having him adopted, while others\r\ncontended to burn him; that at length Logan prevailed, tied a belt of\r\nwampum round him as the mark of adoption, loosed him from the post and\r\ncarried him to the cabin of an old squaw, where Logan pointed out a person\r\nwho he said was this subscriber's cousin; and he afterwards understood\r\nthat the old woman was his aunt, and two others his brothers, and that\r\nhe now stood in the place of a warrior of the family who had been killed\r\nat Yellow Creek; that about three days after this Logan brought him a\r\npiece of paper, and told him he must write a letter for him, which he\r\nmeant to carry and leave in some house where he should kill somebody;\r\nthat he made ink with gun powder, and the subscriber proceeded to write\r\nthe letter by his direction, addressing Captain Michael Cresap in it,\r\nand that the purport of it was, to ask \"why he had killed his people?\r\nThat some time before they had killed his people at some place, (the\r\nname of which the subscriber forgets,) which he had forgiven; but since\r\nthat he had killed his people again at Yellow Creek, and taken his\r\ncousin, a little girl, prisoner; that therefore he must war against the\r\nwhites; but that he would exchange the subscriber for his cousin.\" And\r\nsigned it with Logan's name, which letter Logan took and set out again\r\nto war; and the contents of this letter, as recited by the subscriber,\r\ncalling to mind that stated by Judge Innes to have been left, tied to\r\na war club, in a house where a family was murdered, and that being read\r\nto the subscriber, he recognizes it, and declares he verily believes it\r\nto have been the identical letter which he wrote, and supposes he was\r\nmistaken in stating as he has done before from memory, that the offer\r\nof exchange was proposed in the letter; that it is probable that it was\r\nonly promised him by Logan, but not put in the letter; while he was with\r\nthe old woman, she repeatedly endeavored to make him sensible that she\r\nhad been of the party at Yellow Creek, and, by signs, showed him how\r\nthey decoyed her friends over the river to drink, and when they were\r\nreeling and tumbling about, tomahawked them all, and that whenever she\r\nentered on this subject she was thrown into the most violent agitations,\r\nand that he afterwards understood that, amongst the Indians killed at\r\nYellow Creek, was a sister of Logan, very big with child, whom they\r\nripped open, and stuck on a pole; that he continued with the Indians\r\ntill the month of November, when he was released in consequence of the\r\npeace made by them with Lord Dunmore; that, while he remained with them,\r\nthe Indians in general were very kind to him; and especially those who\r\nwere his adopted relations; but above all, the old woman and family in\r\nwhich he lived, who served him with everything in their power, and never\r\nasked, or even suffered him to do any labor, seeming in truth to consider\r\nand respect him as the friend they had lost.

I did not hear Logan make the above speech; but\r\nfrom the unanimous accounts of those in camp, I have reason to think\r\nthat said speech was delivered to Dunmore. I remember to have heard the\r\nvery things contained in the above speech, related by some of our people\r\nin camp at that time.\r\n\r\n                                                       ANDREW RODGERS.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _The declaration of Mr. John Heckewelder, for several years\r\n     a missionary from the society of Moravians, among the western\r\n     Indians._\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the year 1774, at a time when the interior part of\r\nthe Indian country all seemed peace and tranquil, the villagers on the\r\nMuskingum were suddenly alarmed by two runners (Indians), who reported\r\n\"that the Big Knife (Virginians) had attacked the Mingo settlement,\r\non the Ohio, and butchered even the women with their children in their\r\narms, and that Logan's family were among the slain.\" A day or two after\r\nthis several Mingoes made their appearance; among whom were one or two\r\nwounded, who had in this manner effected their escape. Exasperated to a\r\nhigh degree, after relating the particulars of this transaction, (which\r\nfor humanity's sake I forbear to mention,) after resting some time on\r\nthe treachery of the Big Knives, of their barbarity to those who are\r\ntheir friends, they gave a figurative description of the perpetrators;\r\nnamed Cresap as having been at the head of this murderous act. They made\r\nmention of nine being killed, and two wounded; and were prone to take\r\nrevenge on any person of a white color; for which reason the missionaries\r\nhad to shut themselves up during their stay. From this time terror daily\r\nincreased. The exasperated friends and relations of these murdered women\r\nand children, with the nations to whom they belonged, passed and repassed\r\nthrough the villages of the quiet Delaware towns, in search of white\r\npeople, making use of the most abusive language to these (the Delawares),\r\nsince they would not join in taking revenge. Traders had either to hide\r\nthemselves, or try to get out of the country the best way they could. And\r\neven at this time, they yet found such true friends among the Indians,\r\nwho, at the risk of their own lives, conducted them, with the best part\r\nof their property, to Pittsburg; although, (shameful to relate!) these\r\nbenefactors were, on their return from this mission, waylaid, and fired\r\nupon by whites, while crossing Big Beaver in a canoe, and had one man, a\r\nShawanese, named Silverheels, (a man of note in his nation,) wounded in\r\nthe body. This exasperated the Shawanese so much, that they, or at least\r\na great part of them, immediately took an active part in the cause; and\r\nthe Mingoes, (nearest connected with the former,) became unbounded in\r\ntheir rage. A Mr. Jones, son to a respectable family of this neighborhood\r\n(Bethlehem), who was then on his passage up Muskinghum, with two other\r\nmen, was fortunately espied by a friendly Indian woman, at the falls\r\nof Muskinghum; who through motives of humanity alone, informed Jones\r\nof the nature of the times, and that he was running right in the hands\r\nof the enraged; and put him on the way, where he might perhaps escape\r\nthe vengeance of the strolling parties. One of Jones's men, fatigued by\r\ntravelling in the woods, declared he would rather die than remain longer\r\nin this situation; and hitting accidentally on a path, he determined to\r\nfollow the same. A few hundred yards decided his fate. He was met by a\r\nparty of about fifteen Mingoes, (and as it happened, almost within sight\r\nof White Eyes town,) murdered, and cut to pieces; and his limbs and flesh\r\nstuck up on the bushes. White Eyes, on hearing the scalp halloo, ran\r\nimmediately out with his men, to see what the matter was; and finding\r\nthe mangled body in this condition, gathered the whole and buried it.\r\nBut next day when some of the above party found on their return the body\r\ninterred, they instantly tore up the ground, and endeavored to destroy\r\nor scatter about, the parts at a greater distance. White Eyes, with the\r\nDelawares, watching their motions, gathered and interred the same a second\r\ntime. The war party finding this out, ran furiously into the Delaware\r\nvillage, exclaiming against the conduct of these people, setting forth\r\nthe cruelty of Cresap towards women and children, and declaring at the\r\nsame time, that they would, in consequence of this cruelty, serve every\r\nwhite man they should meet with in the same manner. Times grew worse\r\nand worse, war parties went out and took scalps and prisoners, and the\r\nlatter, in hopes it might be of service in saving their lives, exclaimed\r\nagainst the barbarous act which gave rise to these troubles and against\r\nthe perpetrators. The name of Great-house was mentioned as having been\r\naccomplice to Cresap. So detestable became the latter name among the\r\nIndians, that I have frequently heard them apply it to the worst of\r\nthings; also in quieting or stilling their children, I have heard them\r\nsay, hush! Cresap will fetch you; whereas otherwise, they name the Owl.\r\nThe warriors having afterwards bent their course more toward the Ohio,\r\nand down the same, peace seemed with us already on the return; and this\r\nbecame the case soon after the decided battle fought on the Kanhaway.\r\nTraders, returning now into the Indian country again, related the story\r\nof the above-mentioned massacre, _after the same manner, and with the\r\nsame words_, we have heard it related hitherto. So the report remained,\r\nand was believed by all who resided in the Indian country. So it was\r\nrepresented numbers of times, in the peaceable Delaware towns, by the\r\nenemy. So the christian Indians were continually told they would one day\r\nbe served. With this impression, a petty chief hurried all the way from\r\nWabash in 1779, to take his relations (who were living with the peaceable\r\nDelawares near Coshachking) out of the reach of the Big Knives, in whose\r\nfriendship he never more would place any confidence. And when this man\r\nfound that his numerous relations would not break friendship with the\r\nAmericans, nor be removed, he took two of his relations (women) off by\r\nforce, saying, \"The whole crop should not be destroyed; I will have seed\r\nout of it for a new crop;\" alluding to, and repeatedly reminding those\r\nof the family of Logan, who he said had been real friends to the whites,\r\nand yet were cruelly murdered by them.\r\n\r\nIn Detroit, where I arrived the same Spring, the report respecting the\r\nmurder of the Indians on the Ohio (amongst whom was Logan's family) was\r\nthe same as related above; and on my return to the United States in the\r\nfall of 1786, and from that time, whenever and wherever in my presence,\r\nthis subject was the topic of conversation, I found the report still the\r\nsame; viz. that a person, bearing the name of Cresap, was the author,\r\nor perpetrator of this deed.\r\n\r\nLogan was the second son of Shikellemus, a celebrated chief of the\r\nCayuga nation. This chief, on account of his attachment to the English\r\ngovernment, was of great service to the country, having the confidence of\r\nall the Six Nations, as well as that of the English, he was very useful\r\nin settling disputes, &c., &c. He was highly esteemed by Conrad Weisser,\r\nEsq., (an officer for government in the Indian department), with whom\r\nhe acted conjunctly, and was faithful unto his death. His residence was\r\nat Shamokin, where he took great delight in acts of hospitality to such\r\nof the white people whose business led them that way.[73] His name and\r\nfame were so high on record, that Count Zinzendorf, when in this country\r\nin 1742, became desirous of seeing him, and actually visited him at his\r\nhouse in Shamokin.[74] About the year 1772, Logan was introduced to me\r\nby an Indian friend, as son to the late reputable chief Shikellemus,\r\nand as a friend to the white people. In the course of conversation\r\nI thought him a man of superior talents than Indians generally were.\r\nThe subject turning on vice and immorality, he confessed his too great\r\nshare of this, especially his fondness for liquor. He exclaimed against\r\nthe white people for imposing liquors upon the Indians; he otherwise\r\nadmired their ingenuity; spoke of gentlemen, but observed the Indians\r\nunfortunately had but few of these as their neighbors, &c. He spoke of\r\nhis friendship to the white people, wished always to be a neighbor to\r\nthem, intended to settle on the Ohio, below Big Beaver; was (to the best\r\nof my recollection) then encamped at the mouth of this river, (Beaver,)\r\nurged me to pay him a visit, &c. Note. I was then living at the Moravian\r\ntown on this river, in the neighborhood of Cuskuskee. In April 1773,\r\nwhile on my passage down the Ohio for Muskinghum, I called at Logan's\r\nsettlement; where I received every civility I could expect from such of\r\nthe family as were at home.\r\n\r\nIndian reports concerning Logan, after the death of his family, ran\r\nto this; that he exerted himself during the Shawanese war, (then so\r\ncalled,) to take all the revenge he could, declaring he had lost all\r\nconfidence in the white people. At the time of negotiation, he declared\r\nhis reluctance in laying down the hatchet, not having (in his opinion)\r\nyet taken ample satisfaction; yet, for the sake of the nation, he would\r\ndo it. His expressions, from time to time, denoted a deep melancholy. Life\r\n(said he) had become a torment to him: he knew no more what pleasure was:\r\nhe thought it had been better if he had never existed, &c., &c. Report\r\nfurther states, that he became in some measure delirious, declared he\r\nwould kill himself, went to Detroit, drank very freely, and did not seem\r\nto care what he did, and what became of himself. In this condition he\r\nleft Detroit, and on his way between that place and Miami was murdered.\r\nIn October, 1781, (while as prisoner on my way to Detroit,) I was shown\r\nthe spot where this should have happened. Having had an opportunity\r\nsince last June of seeing the Rev. David Zeisberger, senior, missionary\r\nto the Delaware nation of Indians, who had resided among the same on\r\nMuskinghum, at the time when the murder was committed on the family of\r\nLogan, I put the following questions to him; first, who he had understood\r\nit was that had committed the murder on Logan's family? and secondly,\r\nwhether he had any knowledge of a speech sent to Lord Dunmore by Logan,\r\nin consequence of this affair, &c. To which Mr. Zeisberger's answer\r\nwas: That he had, from that time when this murder was committed to the\r\npresent day, firmly believed the common report (which he had never heard\r\ncontradicted) viz., that one Cresap was the author of the massacre; or\r\nthat it was committed by his orders; and that he had known Logan as a boy,\r\nhad frequently seen him from that time, and doubted not in the least,\r\nthat Logan had sent such a speech to Lord Dunmore on this occasion,\r\nas he understood from me had been published; that expressions of that\r\nkind from Indians were familiar to him; that Logan in particular was a\r\nman of quick comprehension, good judgment and talents. Mr. Zeisberger\r\nhas been a missionary upwards of fifty years; his age is about eighty;\r\nspeaks both the language of the Onondagoes and the Delawares; resides at\r\npresent on the Muskinghum, with his Indian congregation; and is beloved\r\nand respected by all who are acquainted with him.\r\n\r\n                                                     JOHN HECKEWELDER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _From this testimony the following historical statement\r\n     results:_\r\n\r\nIn April or May, 1774, a number of people being engaged in looking out\r\nfor settlements on the Ohio, information was spread among them, that the\r\nIndians had robbed some of the land-jobbers, as those adventurers were\r\ncalled. Alarmed for their safety, they collected together at Wheeling\r\nCreek. [75]Hearing there that there were two Indians and some traders a\r\nlittle above Wheeling, Captain Michael Cresap, one of the party, proposed\r\nto waylay and kill them. The proposition, though opposed, was adopted.\r\nA party went up the river, with Cresap at their head, and killed the\r\ntwo Indians.\r\n\r\n[76]The same afternoon it was reported that there was a party of Indians\r\non the Ohio, a little below Wheeling. Cresap and his party immediately\r\nproceeded down the river, and encamped on the bank. The Indians passed\r\nhim peaceably, and encamped at the mouth of Grave Creek, a little below.\r\nCresap and his party attacked them, and killed several. The Indians\r\nreturned the fire, and wounded one of Cresap's party. Among the slain of\r\nthe Indians were some of Logan's family. Colonel Zane indeed expresses a\r\ndoubt of it; but it is affirmed by Huston and Chambers. Smith, one of the\r\nmurderers, said they were known and acknowledged to be Logan's friends,\r\nand the party themselves generally said so; boasted of it in presence\r\nof Cresap; pretended no provocation; and expressed their expectations\r\nthat Logan would probably avenge their deaths.\r\n\r\nPursuing these examples, [77]Daniel Great-house, and one Tomlinson,\r\nwho lived on the opposite side of the river from the Indians, and were\r\nin habits of friendship with them, collected, at the house of Polke,\r\non Cross Creek, about 16 miles from Baker's Bottom, a party of 32 men.\r\nTheir object was to attack a hunting encampment of Indians, consisting\r\nof men, women, and children, at the mouth of Yellow Creek, some distance\r\nabove Wheeling. They proceeded, and when arrived near Baker's Bottom,\r\nthey concealed themselves, and Great-house crossed the river to the\r\nIndian camp. Being among them as a friend, he counted them, and found\r\nthem too strong for an open attack with his force. While here, he was\r\ncautioned by one of the women not to stay, for that the Indian men were\r\ndrinking, and having heard of Cresap's murder of _their relations_ at\r\nGrave Creek, were angry, and she pressed him in a friendly manner, to go\r\nhome; whereupon, after inviting them to come over and drink, he returned\r\nto Baker's, which was a tavern, and desired that when any of them should\r\ncome to his house he would give them as much rum as they would drink.\r\nWhen his plot was ripe, and a sufficient number of them were collected\r\nat Baker's, and intoxicated, he and his party fell on them and massacred\r\nthe whole, except a little girl, whom they preserved as a prisoner.\r\nAmong these was the very woman who had saved his life, by pressing him to\r\nretire from the drunken wrath of her friends, when he was spying their\r\ncamp at Yellow Creek. Either she herself, or some other of the murdered\r\nwomen, was the sister of Logan, very big with child, and inhumanly and\r\nindecently butchered; and there were others of his relations who fell\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nThe party on the other side of the river,[78] alarmed for their friends\r\nat Baker's, on hearing the report of the guns, manned two canoes and\r\nsent them over. They were received, as they approached the shore, by a\r\nwell-directed fire from Great-house's party, which killed some, wounded\r\nothers, and obliged the rest to put back. Baker tells us there were\r\ntwelve killed, and six or eight wounded.\r\n\r\nThis commenced the war, of which Logan's war-club and note left in the\r\nhouse of a murdered family, was the notification. In the course of it,\r\nduring the ensuing summer, a great number of innocent men, women, and\r\nchildren, fell victims to the tomahawk and scalping knife of the Indians,\r\ntill it was arrested in the autumn following by the battle at Point\r\nPleasant, and the pacification with Lord Dunmore, at which the speech\r\nof Logan was delivered.\r\n\r\nOf the genuineness of that speech nothing need be said. It was known to\r\nthe camp where it was delivered; it was given out by Lord Dunmore and his\r\nofficers; it ran through the public papers of these States; was rehearsed\r\nas an exercise at schools; published in the papers and periodical works\r\nof Europe; and all this, a dozen years before it was copied into the\r\nNotes on Virginia. In fine, General Gibson concludes the question for\r\never, by declaring that he received it from Logan's hand, delivered it\r\nto Lord Dunmore, translated it for him, and that the copy in the Notes\r\non Virginia is a faithful copy.\r\n\r\nThe popular account of these transactions, as stated in the Notes\r\non Virginia, appears, on collecting exact information, imperfect and\r\nerroneous in its details. It was the belief of the day; but how far\r\nits errors were to the prejudice of Cresap, the reader will now judge.\r\nThat he, and those under him, murdered two Indians above Wheeling; that\r\nthey murdered a large number at Grave Creek, among whom were a part of\r\nthe family and relations of Logan, cannot be questioned; and as little\r\nthat this led to the massacre of the rest of the family at Yellow Creek.\r\nLogan imputed the whole to Cresap, in his war-note and peace-speech: the\r\nIndians generally imputed it to Cresap: Lord Dunmore and his officers\r\nimputed it to Cresap: the country, with one accord, imputed it to him:\r\nand whether he were innocent, let the universal verdict now declare.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Map]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     _The declaration of John Sappington, received after the\r\n     publication of the preceding Appendix._\r\n\r\nI, JOHN SAPPINGTON, declare myself to be intimately acquainted with all\r\nthe circumstances respecting the destruction of Logan's family, and do\r\ngive in the following narrative, a true statement of that affair:\r\n\r\n\"Logan's family (if it was his family) was not killed by Cresap, nor\r\nwith his knowledge, nor by his consent, but by the Great-houses and\r\ntheir associates. They were killed 30 miles above Wheeling, near the\r\nmouth of Yellow Creek. Logan's camp was on one side of the river Ohio,\r\nand the house, where the murder was committed, opposite to it on the\r\nother side. They had encamped there only four or five days, and during\r\nthat time had lived peaceably and neighbourly with the whites on the\r\nopposite side, until the very day the affair happened. A little before\r\nthe period alluded to, letters had been received by the inhabitants from\r\na man of great influence in that country, and who was then, I believe,\r\nat Capteener, informing them that war was at hand, and desiring them\r\nto be on their guard. In consequence of those letters and other rumors\r\nof the same import, almost all the inhabitants fled for safety into the\r\nsettlements. It was at the house of one Baker the murder was committed.\r\nBaker was a man who sold rum, and the Indians had made frequent visits\r\nat his house, induced, probably, by their fondness for that liquor. He\r\nhad been particularly desired by Cresap to remove and take away his rum,\r\nand he was actually preparing to move at the time of the murder. The\r\nevening before, a squaw came over to Baker's house, and by her crying\r\nseemed to be in great distress. The cause of her uneasiness being asked,\r\nshe refused to tell; but getting Baker's wife alone, she told her that\r\nthe Indians were going to kill her and all her family the next day, that\r\nshe loved her, did not wish her to be killed, and therefore told her\r\nwhat was intended, that she might save herself. In consequence of this\r\ninformation, Baker got a number of men, to the amount of twenty-one, to\r\ncome to his house, and they were all there before morning. A council\r\nwas held, and it was determined that the men should lie concealed in\r\nthe back apartment; that if the Indians did come, and behaved themselves\r\npeaceably, they should not be molested; but if not, the men were to show\r\nthemselves, and act accordingly. Early in the morning, seven Indians,\r\nfour men and three squaws, came over. Logan's brother was one of them.\r\nThey immediately got rum, and all, except Logan's brother, became very\r\nmuch intoxicated. At this time all the men were concealed, except the\r\nman of the house, Baker, and two others who staid out with him. Those\r\nIndians came unarmed. After some time Logan's brother took down a coat\r\nand hat, belonging to Baker's brother-in-law, who lived with him, and\r\nput them on, and setting his arms a-kimbo, began to strut about, till at\r\nlength coming up to one of the men, he attempted to strike him, saying,\r\n\"White man, son of a bitch.\" The white man, whom he treated thus, kept\r\nout of his way for some time; but growing irritated, he jumped to his\r\ngun, and shot the Indian as he was making to the door with the coat\r\nand hat on him. The men who lay concealed then rushed out, and killed\r\nthe whole of them, excepting one child, which I believe is alive yet.\r\nBut before this happened, one with two, the other with five Indians,\r\nall naked, painted, and armed completely for war, were discovered to\r\nstart from the shore on which Logan's camp was. Had it not been for this\r\ncircumstance, the white men would not have acted as they did; but this\r\nconfirmed what the squaw had told before. The white men, having killed,\r\nas aforesaid, the Indians in the house, ranged themselves along the bank\r\nof the river, to receive the canoes. The canoe with the two Indians came\r\nnear, being the foremost. Our men fired upon them and killed them both.\r\nThe other canoe then went back. After this, two other canoes started,\r\nthe one containing eleven, the other seven, Indians, painted and armed\r\nas the first. They attempted to land below our men, but were fired upon;\r\nhad one killed, and retreated, at the same time firing back. To the best\r\nof my recollection there were three of the Great-houses engaged in this\r\nbusiness. This is a true representation of the affair from beginning to\r\nend. I was intimately acquainted with Cresap, and know he had no hand\r\nin that transaction. He told me himself afterwards, at Redstone Old\r\nFort, that the day before Logan's people were killed, he, with a small\r\nparty, had an engagement with a party of Indians on Capteener, about\r\nforty-four miles lower down. Logan's people were killed at the mouth of\r\nYellow Creek, on the 24th of May, 1774; and the 23d, the day before,\r\nCresap was engaged as already stated. I know, likewise, that he was\r\ngenerally blamed for it, and believed by all who were not acquainted\r\nwith the circumstances to have been the perpetrator of it. I know that\r\nhe despised and hated the Great-houses ever afterwards on account of it.\r\nI was intimately acquainted with General Gibson, and served under him\r\nduring the late war, and I have a discharge from him now lying in the\r\nland-office at Richmond, to which I refer any person for my character,\r\nwho might be disposed to scruple my veracity. I was likewise at the\r\ntreaty held by Lord Dunmore with the Indians, at Chelicothe. As for the\r\nspeech said to have been delivered by Logan on that occasion, it might\r\nhave been, or might not, for anything I know, as I never heard of it till\r\nlong afterwards. I do not believe that Logan had any relations killed,\r\nexcept his brother. Neither of the squaws who were killed was his wife.\r\nTwo of them were old women, and the third, with her child, which was\r\nsaved, I have the best reason in the world to believe was the wife and\r\nchild of General Gibson. I know he educated the child, and took care of\r\nit, as if it had been his own. Whether Logan had a wife or not, I can't\r\nsay; but it is probable that as he was a chief, he considered them all\r\nas his people. All this I am ready to be qualified to at any time.\r\n\r\n                                                      JOHN SAPPINGTON.\r\n     Attest, SAMUEL M'KEE, Junr.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                      Madison County, Feb. 13th, 1800.\r\n\r\nI do certify further, that the above-named John Sappington told me, at\r\nthe same time and place at which he gave me the above narrative, that\r\nhe himself was the man who shot the brother of Logan in the house, as\r\nabove-related, and that he likewise killed one of the Indians in one of\r\nthe canoes, which came over from the opposite shore.\r\n\r\nHe likewise told me, that Cresap never said an angry word to him about\r\nthe matter, although he was frequently in company with Cresap, and indeed\r\nhad been, and continued to be, in habits of intimacy with that gentleman,\r\nand was always befriended by him on every occasion. He further told me,\r\nthat after they had perpetrated the murder, and were flying into the\r\nsettlement, he met with Cresap (if I recollect right, at Redstone Old\r\nFort); and gave him a scalp, a very large fine one, as he expressed it,\r\nand adorned with silver. This scalp, I think he told me, was the scalp\r\nof Logan's brother; though as to this I am not absolutely certain.\r\n\r\n                                                          Certified by\r\n                                                   SAMUEL M'KEE, Junr.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [71] In connection with this appendix see letter to Governor\r\n         Henry, printed as Note in p. 309.\r\n\r\n    [72] The popular pronunciation of Tomlinson, which was the real\r\n         name.\r\n\r\n    [73] The preceding account of Shikellemus, (Logan's father,)\r\n         is copied from manuscripts of the Rev.

Peyton was educated at the College\r\nof William and Mary in Williamsburg, and thence went to England,\r\nand studied law at the Temple. At his return he intermarried\r\nwith Elizabeth Harrison, sister of the afterwards Governor\r\nHarrison, entered into practice in the General Court, was afterwards\r\nappointed the king's Attorney General for the colony, and\r\nbecame a representative in the House of Burgesses (then so\r\ncalled) for the city of Williamsburg.\r\n\r\nGovernor Dinwiddie having, about this period, introduced the\r\nexaction of a new fee on his signature of grants for lands, without\r\nthe sanction of any law, the House of Burgesses remonstrated\r\nagainst it, and sent Peyton Randolph to England, as their\r\nagent to oppose it before the king and council. The interest of\r\nthe governor, as usual, prevailed against that of the colony, and\r\nhis new exaction was confirmed by the king.\r\n\r\nAfter Braddock's defeat on the Monongahela, in 1755, the incursions\r\nof the Indians on our frontiers spread panic and dismay\r\nthrough the whole country, insomuch that it was scarcely possible\r\nto procure men, either as regulars or militia, to go against\r\nthem. To counteract this terror and to set good example, a number\r\nof the wealthiest individuals of the colony, and the highest standing\r\nin it, in public as well as in their private relations, associated\r\nunder obligations to furnish each of them two able-bodied men,\r\nat their own expense, to form themselves into a regiment under\r\nthe denomination of the Virginia Blues, to join the colonial force\r\non the frontier, and place themselves under its commander,\r\nGeorge Washington, then a colonel. They appointed William\r\nByrd, a member of the council, colonel of the regiment, and\r\nPeyton Randolph, I think, had also some command. But the\r\noriginal associators had more the will than the power of becoming\r\neffective soldiers. Born and bred in the lap of wealth, all the\r\nhabits of their lives were of ease, indolence and indulgence.\r\nSuch men were little fitted to sleep under tents, and often without\r\nthem, to be exposed to all the intemperances of the seasons, to\r\nswim rivers, range the woods, climb mountains, wade morasses,\r\nto skulk behind trees, and contend as sharp shooters with the\r\nsavages of the wilderness, who in all the scenes and exercises\r\nwould be in their natural element. Accordingly, the commander\r\nwas more embarrassed with their care, than reinforced by their\r\nservice. They had the good fortune to see no enemy, and to\r\nreturn at the end of the campaign rewarded by the favor of the\r\npublic for this proof of their generous patriotism and good will.\r\n\r\nWhen afterwards, in 1764, on the proposal of the Stamp Act,\r\nthe House of Burgesses determined to send an address against it\r\nto the king, and memorials to the Houses of Lord and Commons,\r\nPeyton Randolph, George Wythe, and (I think) Robert C. Nicholas,\r\nwere appointed to draw these papers. That to the king was\r\nby Peyton Randolph, and the memorial to the Commons was by\r\nGeorge Wythe. It was on the ground of these papers that those\r\ngentlemen opposed the famous resolutions of Mr. Henry in 1765,\r\nto wit, that the principles of these resolutions had been asserted\r\nand maintained in the address and memorials of the year before,\r\nto which an answer was yet to be expected.\r\n\r\nOn the death of the speaker, Robinson, in 1766, Peyton Randolph\r\nwas elected speaker. He resigned his office of Attorney\r\nGeneral, in which he was succeeded by his brother Randolph,\r\nfather of the late Edmund Randolph, and retired from the bar.\r\nHe now devoted himself solely to his duties as a legislator, and\r\nalthough sound in his principles, and going steadily with us in\r\nopposition to the British usurpations, he, with the other older\r\nmembers, yielded the lead to the younger, only tempering their\r\nardor, and so far moderating their pace as to prevent their going\r\ntoo far in advance of the public sentiment.\r\n\r\nOn the establishment of a committee by the legislature, to\r\ncorrespond with the other colonies, he was named their chairman,\r\nand their first proposition to the other colonies was to appoint\r\nsimilar committees, who might consider the expediency of\r\ncalling a general Congress of deputies in order to procure a harmony\r\nof procedure among the whole. This produced the call\r\nof the first Congress, to which he was chosen a delegate, by the\r\nHouse of Burgesses, and of which he was appointed, by that\r\nCongress, its president.\r\n\r\nOn the receipt of what was called Lord North's conciliatory\r\nproposition, in 1775, Lord Dunmore called the General Assembly\r\nand laid it before them. Peyton Randolph quitted the chair of\r\nCongress, in which he was succeeded by Mr. Hancock, and repaired\r\nto that of the House which had deputed him. Anxious\r\nabout the tone and spirit of the answer which should be given\r\n(because being the first it might have effect on those of the\r\nother colonies), and supposing that a younger pen would be more\r\nlikely to come up to the feelings of the body he had left, he requested\r\nme to draw the answer, and steadily supported and carried\r\nit through the House, with a few softenings only from the\r\nmore timid members.\r\n\r\nAfter the adjournment of the House of Burgesses he returned\r\nto Congress, and died there of an apoplexy, on the 22d of October\r\nfollowing, aged, as I should conjecture, about fifty years.\r\n\r\nHe was indeed a most excellent man; and none was ever\r\nmore beloved and respected by his friends. Somewhat cold and\r\ncoy towards strangers, but of the sweetest affability when ripened\r\ninto acquaintance. Of attic pleasantry in conversation, always\r\ngood humored and conciliatory. With a sound and logical head,\r\nhe was well read in the law; and his opinions when consulted,\r\nwere highly regarded, presenting always a learned and sound\r\nview of the subject, but generally, too, a listlessness to go into its\r\nthorough development; for being heavy and inert in body, he\r\nwas rather too indolent and careless for business, which occasioned\r\nhim to get a smaller proportion of it at the bar than his\r\nabilities would otherwise have commanded. Indeed, after his\r\nappointment as Attorney General, he did not seem to court, nor\r\nscarcely to welcome business. In that office he considered himself\r\nequally charged with the rights of the colony as with those\r\nof the crown; and in criminal prosecutions exaggerating nothing,\r\nhe aimed at a candid and just state of the transaction, believing\r\nit more a duty to save an innocent than to convict a\r\nguilty man. Although not eloquent, his matter was so substantial\r\nthat no man commanded more attention, which, joined with\r\na sense of his great worth, gave him a weight in the House of\r\nBurgesses which few ever attained. He was liberal in his expenses,\r\nbut correct also, so as not to be involved in pecuniary\r\nembarrassments; and with a heart always open to the amiable\r\nsensibilities of our nature, he did as many good acts as could\r\nhave been done with his fortune, without injuriously impairing\r\nhis means of continuing them. He left no issue, and gave his\r\nfortune to his widow and nephew, the late Edmund Randolph.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF MERIWETHER LEWIS.[79]\r\n\r\nMeriwether Lewis, late Governor of Louisiana, was born on\r\nthe 18th of August, 1774, near the town of Charlottesville, in\r\nthe county of Albemarle, in Virginia, of one of the distinguished\r\nfamilies of that State. John Lewis, one of his father's uncles,\r\nwas a member of the King's Council before the revolution; another\r\nof them, Fielding Lewis, married a sister of General Washington.\r\nHis father, William Lewis, was the youngest of five\r\nsons of Colonel Robert Lewis of Albemarle, the fourth of whom,\r\nCharles, was one of the early patriots who stepped forward in the\r\ncommencement of the revolution, and commanded one of the\r\nregiments first raised in Virginia, and placed on continental establishment.\r\nHappily situated at home with a wife and young\r\nfamily, and a fortune placing him at ease, he left all to aid in\r\nthe liberation of his country from foreign usurpations, then first\r\nunmasking their ultimate end and aim. His good sense, integrity,\r\nbravery, enterprise and remarkable bodily powers, marked\r\nhim an officer of great promise; but he unfortunately died early\r\nin the revolution. Nicholas Lewis, the second of his father's\r\nbrothers, commanded a regiment of militia in the successful expedition\r\nof 1776, against the Cherokee Indians, who, seduced\r\nby the agents of the British government to take up the hatchet\r\nagainst us, had committed great havoc on our southern frontier,\r\nby murdering and scalping helpless women and children according\r\nto their cruel and cowardly principles of warfare. The chastisement\r\nthey then received closed the history of their wars, prepared\r\nthem for receiving the elements of civilization, which,\r\nzealously inculcated by the present government of the United\r\nStates, have rendered them an industrious, peaceable and happy\r\npeople. This member of the family of Lewises, whose bravery\r\nwas so usefully proved on this occasion, was endeared to all who\r\nknew him by his inflexible probity, courteous disposition, benevolent\r\nheart, and engaging modesty and manners. He was the\r\numpire of all the private differences of his county, selected always\r\nby both parties. He was also the guardian of Meriwether\r\nLewis, of whom we are now to speak, and who had lost his\r\nfather at an early age. He continued some years under the\r\nfostering care of a tender mother, of the respectable family of\r\nMeriwethers of the same county, and was remarkable even in\r\nhis infancy for enterprise, boldness and discretion. When only\r\neight years of age, he habitually went out, in the dead of the\r\nnight, alone with his dogs, into the forest to hunt the raccoon and\r\nopossum, which, seeking their food in the night, can then only\r\nbe taken. In this exercise no season or circumstance could obstruct\r\nhis purpose, plunging through the winter's snows and\r\nfrozen streams in pursuit of his object. At thirteen, he was put\r\nto the Latin school, and continued at that until eighteen, when\r\nhe returned to his mother, and entered on the cares of his farm,\r\nhaving, as well as a younger brother, been left by his father\r\nwith a competency for all the correct and comfortable purposes\r\nof temperate life. His talent for observation, which had led\r\nhim to an accurate knowledge of the plants and animals of his\r\nown county, would have distinguished him as a farmer; but at\r\nthe age of twenty, yielding to the ardor of youth, and a passion\r\nfor more dazzling pursuits, he engaged as a volunteer in the\r\nbody of militia which were called out by General Washington,\r\non occasion of the discontents produced by the excise taxes in\r\nthe western parts of the United States; and from that situation\r\nhe was removed to the regular service as a lieutenant in the line.\r\nAt twenty-three he was promoted to a captaincy; and always\r\nattracting the first attention where punctuality and fidelity were\r\nrequisite, he was appointed paymaster to his regiment. About\r\nthis time a circumstance occurred which, leading to the transaction\r\nwhich is the subject of this book, will justify a recurrence\r\nto its original idea. While I resided in Paris, John Ledyard of\r\nConnecticut arrived there, well known in the United States for\r\nenergy of body and mind. He had accompanied Captain Cook\r\nin his voyage to the Pacific ocean, and distinguished himself on\r\nthat voyage by his intrepidity. Being of a roaming disposition,\r\nhe was now panting for some new enterprise. His immediate\r\nobject at Paris was to engage a mercantile company in the fur\r\ntrade of the western coast of America, in which, however, he\r\nfailed. I then proposed to him to go by land to Kamschatka,\r\ncross in some of the Russian vessels to Nootka Sound, fall down\r\ninto the latitude of the Missouri, and penetrate to and through\r\nthat to the United States. He eagerly seized the idea, and only\r\nasked to be assured of the permission of the Russian government.\r\nI interested in obtaining that M. de Simoulin, M. P. of the\r\nEmpress at Paris, but more especially the Baron de Grimm, M.\r\nP. of Saxe-Gotha, her more special agent and correspondent\r\nthere, in matters not immediately diplomatic. Her permission\r\nwas obtained, and an assurance of protection while the course\r\nof the voyage should be through her territories. Ledyard set\r\nout from Paris and arrived at St. Petersburg after the Empress\r\nhad left that place to pass the winter (I think) at Moscow. His\r\nfinances not permitting him to make unnecessary stay at St.\r\nPetersburg, he left it with a passport from one of the ministers,\r\nand at two hundred miles from Kamschatka, was obliged to take\r\nup his winter quarters. He was preparing in the spring to resume\r\nhis journey, when he was arrested by an officer of the\r\nEmpress, who, by this time, had changed her mind, and forbidden\r\nhis proceeding. He was put into a close carriage and conveyed\r\nday and night, without ever stopping, till they reached\r\nPoland, where he was set down and left to himself. The fatigue\r\nof this journey broke down his constitution, and when he\r\nreturned to Paris, his bodily strength was much impaired. His\r\nmind, however, remained firm; and after this he undertook the\r\njourney to Egypt. I received a letter from him, full of sanguine\r\nhopes, dated at Cairo, the 15th of November, 1788, the day before\r\nhe was to set out for the head of the Nile, on which day; however,\r\nhe ended his career and life; and thus failed the first attempt\r\nto explore the western part of our northern continent.\r\n\r\nIn 1792 I proposed to the A. P. S., that we should set on\r\nfoot a subscription to engage some competent person to explore\r\nthat region in the opposite direction, that is, by ascending\r\nthe Missouri, crossing the Stony mountains, and descending the\r\nnearest river to the Pacific. Captain Lewis being then stationed\r\nat Charlottesville on the recruiting service, warmly solicited me\r\nto obtain for him the execution of that object. I told him it\r\nwas proposed that the person engaged should be attended by a\r\nsingle companion only, to avoid exciting alarm among the Indians.\r\nThis did not deter him. But Mr. André Michaux, a\r\nprofessed botanist, author of the \"_Flora Boreali-Americana_,\"\r\nand of the \"_Histoire des chenes d'Amerique_,\" offering his services,\r\nthey were accepted. He received his instructions, and\r\nwhen he had reached Kentucky in the prosecution of his journey,\r\nhe was overtaken by an order from the minister of France\r\nthen at Philadelphia, to relinquish the expedition, and to pursue\r\nelsewhere the Botanical inquiries on which he was employed by\r\nthat government; and thus failed the second attempt for exploring\r\nthat region.\r\n\r\nIn 1803, the act for establishing trading houses with the Indian\r\ntribes being about to expire, some modifications of it were\r\nrecommended to Congress by a confidential message of January\r\n18th, and an extension of its views to the Indians on the Missouri.\r\nIn order to prepare the way, the message proposed the\r\nsending an exploring party to trace the Missouri to its source, to\r\ncross the highlands and follow the best water communication\r\nwhich offered itself from thence to the Pacific ocean. Congress\r\napproved the proposition, and voted a sum of money for carrying\r\nit into execution. Captain Lewis, who had then been near two\r\nyears with me as private secretary, immediately renewed his solicitations\r\nto have the direction of the party. I had now had\r\nopportunities of knowing him intimately. Of courage undaunted,\r\npossessing a firmness and perseverance of purpose which nothing\r\nbut impossibilities could divert from its direction, careful as a\r\nfather of those committed to his charge, yet steady in the maintenance\r\nof order and discipline, intimate with the Indian character,\r\ncustoms and principles. Habituated to the hunting life,\r\nguarded by exact observation of the vegetables and animals of\r\nhis own country, against losing time in the description of objects\r\nalready possessed, honest, disinterested, liberal, of sound understanding,\r\nand a fidelity to truth so scrupulous that whatever he\r\nshould report would be as certain as if seen by ourselves, with\r\nall these qualifications as if selected and implanted by nature in\r\none body, for this express purpose, I could have no hesitation in\r\nconfiding the enterprise to him. To fill up the measure desired,\r\nhe wanted nothing but a greater familiarity with the technical\r\nlanguage of the natural sciences, and readiness in the astronomical\r\nobservations necessary for the geography of his route.\r\nTo acquire these he repaired immediately to Philadelphia, and\r\nplaced himself under the tutorage of the distinguished professors\r\nof that place, who, with a zeal and emulation, enkindled by an\r\nardent devotion to science, communicated to him freely the information\r\nrequisite for the purposes of the journey. While attending\r\nto at Lancaster, the fabrication of the arms with which\r\nhe chose that his men should be provided, he had the benefit of\r\ndaily communication with Mr. Andrew Ellicott, whose experience\r\nin astronomical observation and practice of it in the woods, enabled\r\nhim to apprize Captain Lewis of the wants and difficulties\r\nhe would encounter, and of the substitutes and resources offered\r\nby a woodland and uninhabited country. Deeming it necessary\r\nhe should have some person with him of known competence to\r\nthe direction of the enterprise, and to whom he might confide\r\nit, in the event of accident to himself, he proposed William\r\nClarke, brother of General George Rogers Clarke, who was approved,\r\nand with that view received a commission of captain.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1803, a draught of his instructions was sent to Captain\r\nLewis, and on the 20th of June they were signed in the following\r\nform:\r\n\r\n\"To Meriwether Lewis, Esquire, Captain of the 1st regiment\r\nof infantry of the United States of America:\r\n\r\n\"Your situation as Secretary of the President of the United\r\nStates has made you acquainted with the objects of my confidential\r\nmessage of January 18th, 1803, to the legislature; you\r\nhave seen the act they passed, which, though expressed in general\r\nterms, was meant to sanction those objects, and you are appointed\r\nto carry them into execution.\r\n\r\n\"Instruments for ascertaining by celestial observations, the\r\ngeography of the country through which you will pass, have\r\nbeen already provided. Light articles for barter and presents\r\namong the Indians, arms for your attendants, say for from ten\r\nto twelve men, boats, tents and other travelling apparatus, with\r\nammunition, medicine, surgical instruments and provisions, you\r\nwill have prepared with such aids as the Secretary at War can\r\nyield in his departments; and from him also you will receive authority\r\nto engage among our troops, by voluntary agreement, the\r\nnumber of attendants above mentioned, over whom you, as their\r\ncommanding officer, are invested with all the powers the laws\r\ngive in such a case.\r\n\r\n\"As your movements while within the limits of the United\r\nStates will be better directed by occasional communications,\r\nadapted to circumstances as they arise, they will not be noticed\r\nhere. What follows will respect your proceedings after your\r\ndeparture from the United States.\r\n\r\n\"Your mission has been communicated to the ministers here\r\nfrom France, Spain and Great Britain, and through them to their\r\ngovernments; and such assurances given them as to its objects,\r\nas we trust will satisfy them. The country of Louisiana having\r\nbeen ceded by Spain to France, the passport you have from\r\nthe minister of France, the representative of the present sovereign\r\nof that country, will be a protection with all its subjects;\r\nand that from the minister of England will entitle you to the\r\nfriendly aid of any traders of that allegiance with whom you\r\nmay happen to meet.\r\n\r\n\"The object of your mission is to explore the Missouri river,\r\nand such principal streams of it, as, by its course and communication\r\nwith the waters of the Pacific ocean, whether the Columbia,\r\nOregon, Colorado, or any other river, may offer the most direct\r\nand practicable water communication across the continent\r\nfor the purposes of commerce.\r\n\r\n\"Beginning at the mouth of the Missouri, you will take observations\r\nof latitude and longitude at all remarkable points on the\r\nriver, and especially at the mouths of rivers, at rapids, at islands,\r\nand other places and objects distinguished by such natural marks\r\nand characters of a durable kind as that they may with certainty\r\nbe recognized hereafter. The courses of the river between these\r\npoints of observation may be supplied by the compass, the log-line\r\nand by time, corrected by the observations themselves. The\r\nvariations of the compass too, in different places, should be\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\n\"The interesting points of the portage between the heads of\r\nthe Missouri, and of the water offering the best communication\r\nwith the Pacific ocean, should also be fixed by observation, and\r\nthe course of that water to the ocean, in the same manner as\r\nthat of the Missouri.\r\n\r\n\"Your observations are to be taken with great pains and accuracy,\r\nto be entered distinctly and intelligibly for others as well\r\nas yourself, to comprehend all the elements necessary, with the\r\naid of the usual tables, to fix the latitude and longitude of the\r\nplaces at which they were taken, and are to be rendered to the\r\nwar office, for the purpose of having the calculations made concurrently\r\nby proper persons within the United States. Several\r\ncopies of these as well as of your other notes should be made at\r\nleisure times, and put into the care of the most trust-worthy of\r\nyour attendants, to guard, by multiplying them, against the accidental\r\nlosses to which they will be exposed. A further guard\r\nwould be that one of these copies be on the paper of the birch,\r\nas less liable to injury from damp than common paper.\r\n\r\n\"The commerce which may be carried on with the people inhabiting\r\nthe line you will pursue, renders a knowledge of those\r\npeople important. You will, therefore, endeavor to make yourself\r\nacquainted, as far as a diligent pursuit of your journey shall\r\nadmit, with the names of the nations and their numbers; the\r\nextent of their possessions; their relations with other tribes or\r\nnations; their language, traditions, monuments; their ordinary\r\noccupations in agriculture, fishing, hunting, war, arts, and the\r\nimplements for these; their food, clothing and domestic accommodations;\r\nthe diseases prevalent among them, and the remedies\r\nthey use; moral and physical circumstances which distinguish\r\nthem from the tribes we know; peculiarities in their laws, customs\r\nand dispositions; and articles of commerce they may need\r\nor furnish, and to what extent; and, considering the interest\r\nwhich every nation has in extending and strengthening the authority\r\nof reason and justice among the people around them, it\r\nwill be useful to acquire what knowledge you can of the state\r\nof morality, religion, and information among them, as it may\r\nbetter enable those who may endeavor to civilize and instruct\r\nthem, to adopt their measures to the existing notions and practices\r\nof those on whom they are to operate.\r\n\r\n\"Other objects worthy of notice will be, the soil and face of\r\nthe country, its growth and vegetable productions, especially\r\nthose not of the United States, the animals of the country generally,\r\nand especially those not known in the United States; the\r\nremains and accounts of any which may be deemed rare or extinct;\r\nthe mineral productions of every kind, but particularly\r\nmetals, lime-stone, pit-coal and salt-petre; salines and mineral\r\nwaters, noting the temperature of the last, and such circumstances\r\nas may indicate their character; volcanic appearances; climate,\r\nas characterized by the thermometer, by the proportion of\r\nrainy, cloudy, and clear days, by lightning, hail, snow, ice, by\r\nthe access and recess of frost, by the winds prevailing at different\r\nseasons, the dates at which particular plants put forth or\r\nlose their flower or leaf, times of appearance of particular birds,\r\nreptiles or insects.\r\n\r\n\"Although your route will be along the channel of the Missouri,\r\nyet you will endeavor to inform yourself, by inquiry, of the\r\ncharacter and extent of the country watered by its branches, and\r\nespecially on its southern side. The north river, or Rio Bravo,\r\nwhich runs into the Gulf of Mexico, and the north river, or Rio\r\nColorado, which runs into the Gulf of California, are understood\r\nto be the principal streams heading opposite to the waters of\r\nthe Missouri, and running southwardly. Whether the dividing\r\ngrounds between the Missouri and them are mountains or flat\r\nlands, what are their distance from the Missouri, the character of\r\nthe intermediate country, and the people inhabiting it, are\r\nworthy of particular inquiry. The northern waters of the Missouri\r\nare less to be inquired after, because they have been ascertained\r\nto a considerable degree, and are still in a course of ascertainment\r\nby English traders and travellers. But if you can\r\nlearn anything certain of the most northern source of the Mississippi,\r\nand of its position relatively to the lake of the woods,\r\nit will be interesting to us. Some account, too, of the path of\r\nthe Canadian traders from the Mississippi, at the mouth of the\r\nOuisconsing to where it strikes the Missouri, and of the soil and\r\nrivers in its course, is desirable.\r\n\r\n\"In all your intercourse with the natives, treat them in the most\r\nfriendly and conciliatory manner which their own conduct will\r\nadmit; allay all jealousies as to the object of your journey, satisfy\r\nthem of its innocence; make them acquainted with the position,\r\nextent, character, peaceable and commercial dispositions of the\r\nUnited States, of our wish to be neighborly, friendly and useful\r\nto them, and of our dispositions to a commercial intercourse with\r\nthem; confer with them on the points most convenient as mutual\r\nemporiums, and the articles of most desirable interchange\r\nfor them and us. If a few of their influential chiefs within practicable\r\ndistance, wish to visit us, arrange such a visit with them,\r\nand furnish them with authority to call on our officers, on their\r\nentering the United States, to have them conveyed to this place\r\nat the public expense. If any of them should wish to have some\r\nof their young people brought up with us, and taught such arts\r\nas may be useful to them, we will receive, instruct, and take care\r\nof them. Such a mission, whether of influential chiefs or of\r\nyoung people, would give some security to your own party.\r\nCarry with you some matter of the kine pox; inform those of\r\nthem with whom you may be, of its efficacy as a preservative\r\nfrom the small pox; and instruct and encourage them in the use\r\nof it. This may be especially done wherever you winter.\r\n\r\n\"As it is impossible for us to foresee in what manner you will\r\nbe received by those people, whether with hospitality or hostility,\r\nso is it impossible to prescribe the exact degree of perseverance\r\nwith which you are to pursue your journey.

States of America.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile these things were going on here, the country of Louisiana,\r\nlately ceded by Spain to France, had been the subject of\r\nnegotiation between us and this last power; and had actually\r\nbeen transferred to us by treaties executed at Paris on the 30th\r\nof April. This information, received about the 1st day of July,\r\nincreased infinitely the interest we felt in the expedition, and\r\nlessened the apprehensions of interruption from other powers.\r\nEverything in this quarter being now prepared, Captain Lewis\r\nleft Washington on the 5th of July, 1803, and proceeded to\r\nPittsburg, where other articles had been ordered to be provided\r\nfor him. The men, too, were to be selected from the military\r\nstations on the Ohio. Delays of preparation, difficulties of navigation\r\ndown the Ohio, and other untoward obstructions, retarded\r\nhis arrival at Cahokia until the season was so far advanced as to\r\nrender it prudent to suspend his entering the Missouri before the\r\nice should break up in the succeeding spring. From this time\r\nhis journal, now published, will give the history of his journey\r\nto and from the Pacific ocean, until his return to St. Louis on\r\nthe 23d of September, 1806. Never did a similar event excite\r\nmore joy through the United States.\r\n\r\nThe humblest of its citizens had taken a lively interest in the\r\nissue of this journey, and looked forward with impatience for\r\nthe information it would furnish. Their anxieties, too, for the\r\nsafety of the corps had been kept in a state of excitement by\r\nlugubrious rumors, circulated from time to time on uncertain authorities,\r\nand uncontradicted by letters or other direct information\r\nfrom the time they had left the Mandan towns on their ascent\r\nup the river in April of the preceding year, 1805, until their\r\nactual return to St. Louis.\r\n\r\nIt was the middle of Feb. 1807, before Capt. Lewis with his\r\ncompanion Clarke reached the city of Washington, where Congress\r\nwas then in session. That body granted to the two chiefs\r\nand their followers, the donation of lands which they had been\r\nencouraged to expect in reward of their toils and dangers. Capt.\r\nLewis was soon after appointed Governor of Louisiana, and Capt.\r\nClarke a General of its militia, and agent of the United States\r\nfor Indian affairs in that department.\r\n\r\nA considerable time intervened before the Governor's arrival\r\nat St. Louis. He found the territory distracted by feuds and\r\ncontentions among the officers of the government, and the people\r\nthemselves divided by these into factions and parties. He\r\ndetermined at once to take no sides with either, but to use every\r\nendeavor to conciliate and harmonize them. The even-handed\r\njustice he administered to all soon established a respect for his\r\nperson and authority, and perseverance and time wore down\r\nanimosities, and reunited the citizens again into one family.\r\n\r\nGovernor Lewis had from early life been subject to hypochondriac\r\naffections. It was a constitutional disposition in all the\r\nnearer branches of the family of his name, and was more immediately\r\ninherited by him from his father. They had not, however,\r\nbeen so strong as to give uneasiness to his family. While\r\nhe lived with me in Washington, I observed at times sensible\r\ndepressions of mind, but knowing their constitutional source, I\r\nestimated their course by what I had seen in the family. During\r\nhis western expedition, the constant exertion which that required\r\nof all the faculties of body and mind, suspended these\r\ndistressing affections; but after his establishment at St. Louis in\r\nsedentary occupations, they returned upon him with redoubled\r\nvigor, and began seriously to alarm his friends. He was in a\r\nparoxysm of one of these when his affairs rendered it necessary\r\nfor him to go to Washington. He proceeded to the Chickasaw\r\nbluffs, where he arrived on the 15th of September, 1809, with a\r\nview of continuing his journey thence by water. Mr. Neely,\r\nagent of the United States with the Chickasaw Indians, arriving\r\nthere two days after, found him extremely indisposed, and betraying\r\nat times some symptoms of a derangement of mind.\r\nThe rumors of a war with England, and apprehensions that he\r\nmight lose the papers he was bringing on, among which were\r\nthe vouchers of his public accounts, and the journals and papers\r\nof his western expedition, induced him here to change his mind,\r\nand to take his course by land through the Chickasaw country.\r\nAlthough he appeared somewhat relieved, Mr. Neely kindly determined\r\nto accompany and watch over him. Unfortunately, at\r\ntheir encampment, after having passed the Tennessee one day's\r\njourney, they lost two horses, which obliging Mr. Neely to halt\r\nfor their recovery, the Governor proceeded under a promise to\r\nwait for him at the house of the first white inhabitant on his\r\nroad. He stopped at the house of a Mr. Grinder, who, not being\r\nat home, his wife, alarmed at the symptoms of derangement she\r\ndiscovered, gave him up the house, and retired to rest herself in\r\nan out-house; the Governor's and Neely's servants lodging in\r\nanother. About 3 o'clock in the night he did the deed which\r\nplunged his friends into affliction, and deprived his country of one\r\nof her most valued citizens, whose valor and intelligence would\r\nhave been now employed in avenging the wrongs of his country,\r\nand in emulating by land the splendid deeds which have\r\nhonored her arms on the ocean. It lost, too, to the nation the\r\nbenefit of receiving from his own hand the narrative now offered\r\nthem of his sufferings and successes in endeavoring to extend\r\nfor them the boundaries of science, and to present to their knowledge\r\nthat vast and fertile country which their sons are destined\r\nto fill with arts, with science, with freedom and happiness.\r\n\r\nTo this melancholy close of the life of one whom posterity\r\nwill declare not to have lived in vain, I have only to add that\r\nall the facts I have stated, are either known to myself, or communicated\r\nby his family or others, for whose truth I have no\r\nhesitation to make myself responsible; and I conclude with tendering\r\nyou the assurances of my respect and consideration.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [79] TO MR. PAUL ALLEN, PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n                                          MONTICELLO, April 13, 1813.\r\n\r\n         SIR,--In compliance with the request conveyed in your letter\r\n         of May 25th, I have endeavored to obtain from the relations\r\n         and friends of the late Governor Lewis, information of such\r\n         incidents of his life as might be not unacceptable to those\r\n         who may read the narrative of his western discoveries.\r\n         The ordinary occurrences of a private life, and those\r\n         also while acting in a subordinate sphere in the army, in\r\n         a time of peace, are not deemed sufficiently interesting\r\n         to occupy the public attention; but a general account of\r\n         his parentage, with such smaller incidents as marked early\r\n         character, are briefly noted, and to these are added, as\r\n         being peculiarly within my own knowledge, whatever related\r\n         to the public mission, of which an account is not to be\r\n         published. The result of my inquiries and recollections\r\n         shall now be offered, to be enlarged or abridged as you\r\n         may think best, or otherwise to be used with the materials\r\n         you may have collected from other sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\n1. _Circumstances relating to General Kosciusko previously\r\nto his joining the American Army._ Kosciusko was born in\r\nthe Grand Duchy of Silliciania in the year 1752. His family\r\nwas noble, and his patrimony considerable; circumstances\r\nwhich he justly appreciated, for as belonging to himself they\r\nwere never matters of boasting, and rarely subjects of notice,\r\nand as the property of others only regarded as advantages\r\nwhen accompanied by good sense and good morals.\r\nThe workings of his mind on the subject of civil liberty were\r\nearly and vigorous; before he was twenty the vassalage of his\r\nserfs filled him with abhorrence, and the first act of his manhood\r\nwas to break their fetters.\r\n\r\nIn the domestic quarrel between the king and the dissidents\r\nin 1761, he was too young to take a part, but the partition of\r\nPoland in 1772 (of which this quarrel was one of the pretences),\r\nengaged him in the defence of his country, and soon made him\r\nsensible of the value of military education, which he afterwards\r\nsought in the schools of Paris. It was there and while prosecuting\r\nthis object, that he first became acquainted with the name\r\nof America, and the nature of the war in which the British colonies\r\nwere then engaged with the mother country. In the summer\r\nof 1776 he embarked for this country, and in October of\r\nthat year was appointed by Congress a Colonel of Engineers.\r\n\r\n2. _Services of the General during the war._ In the spring of\r\n1777 he joined the northern army, and in July following the\r\nwriter of this notice left him on Lake Champlain engaged in\r\nstrengthening our works at Ticonderoga and Mount Independence.\r\nThe unfortunate character of the early part of this campaign\r\nis sufficiently known. In the retreat of the American\r\narmy Kosciusko was distinguished for activity and courage, and\r\nupon him devolved the choice of camps and posts and everything\r\nconnected with fortifications. The last frontier taken by\r\nthe army while commanded by Gen. Schuyler was on an island\r\nin the Hudson near the mouth of the Mohawk river, and within\r\na few miles of Albany. Here Gates, who had superseded\r\nSchuyler, found the army on the ---- day of August. Public\r\nfeeling and opinion were strikingly affected by the arrival of\r\nthis officer, who gave it a full and lasting impression by ordering\r\nthe army to advance upon the enemy. The state of things at\r\nthat moment are well and faithfully expressed by that distinguished\r\nofficer, Col. Udney Hay, in a letter to a friend. \"Fortune,\"\r\nsays he, \"as if tired of persecuting us, had began to\r\nchange, and Burgoyne had suffered materially on both his flanks.\r\nBut these things were not of our doing; the main army, as it\r\nwas called, was hunted from post to pillar, and dared not to\r\nmeasure its strength with the enemy; much was wanting to reinspire\r\nit with confidence in itself, with that self-respect without\r\nwhich an army is but a flock of sheep, a proof of which is\r\nfound in the fact, that we have thanked in general orders a detachment\r\ndouble the force of that of the enemy, for having\r\ndared to return their fire. From this miserable state of despondency\r\nand terror, Gates' arrival raised us, as if by magic. We\r\nbegan to hope and then to act. Our first step was to Stillwater,\r\nand we are now on the heights called Bhemus', looking the\r\nenemy boldly in the face. Kosciusko has selected this ground,\r\nand has covered its weak point (its right) with redoubts from the\r\nhill to the river.\" In front of this camp thus fortified two battles\r\nwere fought, which eventuated in the retreat of the enemy\r\nand his surrender at Saratoga!\r\n\r\nThe value of Colonel Kosciusko's services during this campaign,\r\nand that of 1778, will be found in the following extract\r\nfrom a letter of General Gates written in the spring of 1780:\r\n\r\n     \"My dear friend: After parting with you at Yorktown, I got\r\n     safely to my own fireside, and without inconvenience of any\r\n     kind, excepting sometimes cold toes and cold fingers. Of this\r\n     sort of punishment, however, I am, it seems, to have no more,\r\n     as I am destined by the Congress to command in the South. In\r\n     entering on this new and (as Lee says) most difficult theatre of\r\n     the war, my first thoughts have been turned to the selections of\r\n     an Engineer, an Adjutant-General and a Quarter-Master-General,\r\n     Kosciusko, Hay and yourself, if I can prevail upon you all,\r\n     are to fill these offices, and will fill them well. The\r\n     _excellent qualities_ of the Pole, which no one knows better\r\n     than yourself, are now acknowledged at head-quarters, and may\r\n     induce others to prevent his joining us. But his promise once\r\n     given, we are sure of him.\"\r\n\r\nThe ---- of Gates, for which the preceding extract had prepared\r\nus, was given and accepted, and though no time was lost\r\nby Kosciusko, his arrival was not early enough to enable him to\r\ngive his assistance to his old friend and General. But to Greene\r\n(his successor) he rendered the most important services to the\r\nlast moment of the war, and which were such as drew from that\r\nofficer the most lively, ardent, repeated acknowledgments, which\r\ninduced Congress, in October, 1783, to bestow upon him the\r\nbrevet of Brigadier General, and to pass a vote declaratory _of their\r\nhigh sense of his faithful and meritorious conduct_.\r\n\r\nThe war having ended, he now contemplated returning to\r\nPoland, and was determined in this measure by a letter from\r\nPrince Joseph Poniatowski, nephew of the king and generalissimo\r\nof the army. It was, however, ten years after this period (1783)\r\nbefore Kosciusko drew the sword on the frontiers of Cracovia.\r\n\r\n3. _Conduct of Kosciusko in France._ When Bonaparte created\r\nthe Duchy of Warsaw and bestowed it on the King of Saxony,\r\ngreat pains were taken to induce Kosciusko to lend himself to the\r\nfrontier and support of that policy. Having withstood both the\r\nsmiles and the frowns of the minister of police, a last attempt\r\nwas made through the General's countrywoman and friend, the\r\nPrincess Sassiche. The argument she used was founded on the\r\ncondition of Poland, which, she said, no change could make worse,\r\nand that of the General which even a small change might make\r\nbetter. \"But on this head I have a _carte blanche_, Princess,\" answered\r\nthe General (taking her hand and leading her to her carriage),\r\n\"it is the first time in my life I have wished to shorten\r\nyour visit; but you shall not make me think less respectfully of\r\nyou than I now do.\"\r\n\r\nWhen these attempts had failed, a manifesto in the name of\r\nKosciusko, dated at Warsaw and addressed to the Poles, was\r\nfabricated and published at Paris. When he complained of this\r\nabuse of his name, &c., the minister of Police advised him to go\r\nto Fontainebleau.\r\n\r\n\r\nANECDOTES OF DOCTOR FRANKLIN.[80]\r\n\r\nOur revolutionary process, as is well known, commenced by petitions,\r\nmemorials, remonstrances, &c., from the old Congress.\r\nThese were followed by a non-importation agreement, as a pacific\r\ninstrument of coercion. While that was before us, and\r\nsundry exceptions, as of arms, ammunition, &c., were moved\r\nfrom different quarters of the house, I was sitting by Dr. Franklin\r\nand observed to him that I thought we should except books;\r\nthat we ought not to exclude science, even coming from an enemy.\r\nHe thought so too, and I proposed the exception, which\r\nwas agreed to. Soon after it occurred that medicine should be\r\nexcepted, and I suggested that also to the Doctor. \"As to that,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I will tell you a story. When I was in London, in\r\nsuch a year, there was a weekly club of physicians, of which\r\nSir John Pringle was President, and I was invited by my friend\r\nDr. Fothergill to attend when convenient. Their rule was to\r\npropose a thesis one week and discuss it the next. I happened\r\nthere when the question to be considered was whether physicians\r\nhad, on the whole, done most good or harm? The young members,\r\nparticularly, having discussed it very learnedly and eloquently\r\ntill the subject was exhausted, one of them observed to\r\nSir John Pringle, that although it was not usual for the President\r\nto take part in a debate, yet they were desirous to know his\r\nopinion on the question. He said they must first tell him whether,\r\nunder the appellation of physicians, they meant to include\r\n_old women_, if they did he thought they had done more good\r\nthan harm, otherwise more harm than good.\"\r\n\r\nThe confederation of the States, while on the carpet before\r\nthe old Congress, was strenuously opposed by the smaller States,\r\nunder apprehensions that they would be swallowed up by the\r\nlarger ones. We were long engaged in the discussion; it produced\r\ngreat heats, much ill humor, and intemperate declarations\r\nfrom some members. Dr. Franklin at length brought the debate\r\nto a close with one of his little apologues. He observed that\r\n\"at the time of the union of England and Scotland, the Duke\r\nof Argyle was most violently opposed to that measure, and\r\namong other things predicted that, as the whale had swallowed\r\nJonas, so Scotland would be swallowed by England. However,\"\r\nsaid the Doctor, \"when Lord Bute came into the government,\r\nhe soon brought into its administration so many of his\r\ncountrymen, that it was found in event that Jonas swallowed the\r\nwhale.\" This little story produced a _general_ laugh, and restored\r\ngood humor, and the article of difficulty was passed.\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Franklin went to France, on his revolutionary\r\nmission, his eminence as a philosopher, his venerable appearance,\r\nand the cause on which he was sent, rendered him extremely\r\npopular. For all ranks and conditions of men there, entered\r\nwarmly into the American interest. He was, therefore, feasted\r\nand invited to all the court parties. At these he sometimes met\r\nthe old Duchess of Bourbon, who, being a chess player of about\r\nhis force, they very generally played together. Happening once\r\nto put her king into prize, the Doctor took it. \"Ah,\" says she,\r\n\"we do not take kings so.\" \"We do in America,\" said the Doctor.\r\n\r\nAt one of these parties the emperor Joseph II. then at Paris,\r\nincog., under the title of Count Falkenstein, was overlooking the\r\ngame in silence, while the company was engaged in animated\r\nconversations on the American question. \"How happens it M. le\r\nComte,\" said the Duchess, \"that while we all feel so much interest\r\nin the cause of the Americans, you say nothing for them?\"\r\n\"I am a king by trade,\" said he.\r\n\r\nWhen the Declaration of Independence was under the consideration\r\nof Congress, there were two or three unlucky expressions\r\nin it which gave offence to some members. The words\r\n\"Scotch and other foreign auxiliaries\" excited the ire of a gentleman\r\nor two of that country. Severe strictures on the conduct\r\nof the British king, in negotiating our repeated repeals of the\r\nlaw which permitted the importation of slaves, were disapproved\r\nby some Southern gentlemen, whose reflections were not yet\r\nmatured to the full abhorrence of that traffic. Although the offensive\r\nexpressions were immediately yielded, these gentlemen\r\ncontinued their depredations on other parts of the instrument. I\r\nwas sitting by Dr. Franklin, who perceived that I was not insensible\r\nto these mutilations. \"I have made it a rule,\" said he,\r\n\"whenever in my power, to avoid becoming the draughtsman of\r\npapers to be reviewed by a public body. I took my lesson from\r\nan incident which I will relate to you. When I was a journeyman\r\nprinter, one of my companions, an apprentice hatter, having\r\nserved out his time, was about to open shop for himself. His\r\nfirst concern was to have a handsome sign-board, with a proper\r\ninscription. He composed it in these words, 'John Thompson,\r\n_Hatter_, _makes_ and _sells hats_ for ready money,' with a figure of\r\na hat subjoined; but he thought he would submit it to his friends\r\nfor their amendments. The first he showed it to thought the\r\nword '_Hatter_' tautologous, because followed by the words\r\n'makes hats,' which show he was a hatter. It was struck out.\r\nThe next observed that the word '_makes_' might as well be\r\nomitted, because his customers would not care who made the\r\nhats. If good and to their mind, they would buy, by whomsoever\r\nmade. He struck it out. A third said he thought the words\r\n'_for ready money_' were useless, as it was not the custom of the\r\nplace to sell on credit. Every one who purchased expected to\r\npay. They were parted with, and the inscription now stood,\r\n'John Thompson sells hats.' '_Sells hats_' says his next friend!\r\nWhy nobody will expect you to give them away, what then is\r\nthe use of that word? It was stricken out, and '_hats_' followed\r\nit, the rather as there was one painted on the board. So the inscription\r\nwas reduced ultimately to 'John Thompson' with the\r\nfigure of a hat subjoined.\"\r\n\r\nThe Doctor told me at Paris the two following anecdotes of\r\nthe Abbé Raynal. He had a party to dine with him one day\r\nat Passy, of whom one half were Americans, the other half\r\nFrench, and among the last was the Abbé. During the dinner\r\nhe got on his favorite theory of the degeneracy of animals, and\r\neven of man, in America, and urged it with his usual eloquence.\r\nThe Doctor at length noticing the accidental stature and position\r\nof his guests, at table, \"Come,\" says he, \"M. l'Abbé, let us try\r\nthis question by the fact before us. We are here one half Americans,\r\nand one half French, and it happens that the Americans\r\nhave placed themselves on one side of the table, and our French\r\nfriends are on the other. Let both parties rise, and we will see\r\non which side nature has degenerated.\" It happened that his\r\nAmerican guests were Carmichael, Harmer, Humphreys, and\r\nothers of the finest stature and form; while those of the other\r\nside were remarkably diminutive, and the Abbé himself particularly,\r\nwas a mere shrimp. He parried the appeal, however,\r\nby a complimentary admission of exceptions, among which the\r\nDoctor himself was a conspicuous one.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor and Silas Deane were in conversation one day at\r\nPassy, on the numerous errors in the Abbé's \"_Histoire des deux\r\nIndes_,\" when he happened to step in. After the usual salutations,\r\nSilas Deane said to him, \"The Doctor and myself, Abbé,\r\nwere just speaking of the errors of fact into which you have been\r\nled in your history.\" \"Oh, no, Sir,\" said the Abbé, \"that is impossible.\r\nI took the greatest care not to insert a single fact, for\r\nwhich I had not the most unquestionable authority.\" \"Why,\"\r\nsays Deane, \"there is the story of Polly Baker, and the eloquent\r\napology you have put into her mouth, when brought before a\r\ncourt of Massachusetts to suffer punishment under a law which\r\nyou cite, for having had a bastard. I know there never was\r\nsuch a law in Massachusetts.\" \"Be assured,\" said the Abbé,\r\n\"you are mistaken, and that that is a true story. I do not immediately\r\nrecollect indeed the particular information on which I\r\nquote it; but I am certain that I had for it unquestionable authority.\"\r\nDoctor Franklin, who had been for some time shaking\r\nwith unrestrained laughter at the Abbé's confidence in his\r\nauthority for that tale, said, \"I will tell you, Abbé, the origin\r\nof that story. When I was a printer and editor of a newspaper,\r\nwe were sometimes slack of news, and, to amuse our customers,\r\nI used to fill up our vacant columns with anecdotes and fables,\r\nand fancies of my own, and this of Polly Baker is a story of my\r\nmaking, on one of these occasions.\" The Abbé, without the\r\nleast disconcert, exclaimed with a laugh, \"Oh, very well, Doctor,\r\nI had rather relate your stories than other men's truths.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [80] TO ROBERT WALSH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                      MONTICELLO, December 4, 1818.\r\n\r\n         DEAR SIR,--Yours of November 8th has been some time\r\n         received; but it is in my power to give little satisfaction\r\n         as to its inquiries. Dr. Franklin had many political\r\n         enemies, as every character must which, with decision\r\n         enough to have opinions, has energy and talent to give them\r\n         effect on the feelings of the adversary opinion. These\r\n         enmities were chiefly in Pennsylvania and Massachusetts:\r\n         in the former they were merely of the proprietary party;\r\n         in the latter they did not commence till the revolution,\r\n         and then sprung chiefly from personal animosities, which\r\n         spreading by little and little, became at length of some\r\n         extent. Dr. Lee was his principal calumniator, a man of much\r\n         malignity, who, besides enlisting his whole family in the\r\n         same hostility, was enabled, as the agent of Massachusetts\r\n         with the British government, to infuse it into that State\r\n         with considerable effect. Mr. Izard, the Doctor's enemy\r\n         also, but from a pecuniary transaction, never countenanced\r\n         these charges against him. Mr. Jay, Silas Deane, Mr.\r\n         Laurens, his colleagues also, ever maintained towards him\r\n         unlimited confidence and respect. That he would have waived\r\n         the formal recognition of our Independence I never heard on\r\n         any authority worthy notice. As to the fisheries, England\r\n         was urgent to retain them exclusively, France neutral;\r\n         and I believe that had they been ultimately made a _sine\r\n         quâ non_, our commissioners (Mr. Adams excepted) would have\r\n         relinquished them rather than have broken off the treaty.\r\n         To Mr. Adams' perseverance alone on that point I have\r\n         always understood we were indebted for their reservation.\r\n         As to the charge of subservience to France, besides the\r\n         evidence of his friendly colleagues before named, two\r\n         years of my own service with him at Paris, daily visits,\r\n         and the most friendly and confidential conversations,\r\n         convince me it had not a shadow of foundation. He possessed\r\n         the confidence of that government in the highest degree,\r\n         insomuch that it may truly be said that they were more\r\n         under his influence than he under theirs. The fact is that\r\n         his temper was so amiable and conciliatory, his conduct\r\n         so rational, never urging impossibilities, or even things\r\n         unreasonably inconvenient to them, in short so moderate and\r\n         attentive to their difficulties as well as our own, that\r\n         what his enemies called subserviency, I saw was only that\r\n         reasonable disposition, which, sensible that advantages\r\n         are not all to be on one side, yielding what is just\r\n         and liberal, is the more certain of obtaining liberality\r\n         and justice. Mutual confidence produces of course mutual\r\n         influence, and this was all which subsisted between Dr.\r\n         Franklin and the government of France.\r\n\r\n         I state a few anecdotes of Dr. Franklin, within my own\r\n         knowledge, too much in detail for the scale of Delaplaine's\r\n         work, but which may find _a cadre_ in some of the more\r\n         particular views you contemplate. My health is in a\r\n         great measure restored, and our family joins with me in\r\n         affectionate recollections and assurances of respect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROCEEDINGS\r\n\r\nOF THE\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nIN MAINTAINING THE PUBLIC RIGHT TO THE BEACH OF THE\r\nMISSISSIPPI, ADJACENT TO NEW ORLEANS, AGAINST THE\r\nINTRUSION OF EDWARD LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARED FOR THE USE OF COUNSEL,\r\n\r\nBY THOMAS JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.[81]\r\n\r\n                                                 Page\r\n     Title of the Jesuits,                         5\r\n     Term 'face au fleuve,'                        5\r\n     Confiscation,                                 5\r\n     Title of B.

Instead of viewing this as a public act, and\r\nhaving recourse to those proceedings which are regularly provided for\r\nconflicting claims between the public and an individual, he chose to\r\nconsider it as a private trespass committed on his freehold, by myself\r\npersonally, and instituted against me, after my retirement from office,\r\nan action of trespass, in the circuit court of the United States for\r\nthe district of Virginia.\r\n\r\nBeing requested by my Counsel to furnish them with a statement of the\r\nfacts of the case, as well as of my own ideas of the questions of right,\r\nI proceeded to make such a statement, fully as to facts, but briefly\r\nand generally as to the questions of right. In the progress of the\r\nwork, however, I found myself drawn insensibly into details, and finally\r\nconcluded to meet the questions generally which the case would present,\r\nand to expose the weakness of the plaintiff's pretensions, in addition\r\nto the strength of the public right. These questions were of course\r\nto arise under the laws of the territory of Orleans, composed of the\r\nRoman, the French, and Spanish codes, and written in those languages.\r\nThe books containing them are so rare in this country as scarcely to be\r\nfound in the best-furnished libraries. Having more time than my Counsel,\r\nconsistently with their duties to others, could bestow on researches so\r\nmuch out of the ordinary line, I thought myself bound to facilitate their\r\nlabors, and furnish them with such materials as I could collect. I did\r\nit by full extracts from the several authorities, and in the languages in\r\nwhich they were originally written, that they might judge for themselves\r\nwhether I misinterpreted them. These materials and topics, expressed in\r\nthe technical style of the law, familiar to them, they were of course to\r\nuse or not to use, according to the dictates of their better judgment. If\r\nused, it would be with the benefit of being delivered in a form better\r\nsuited to the public ear. I passed over the question of jurisdiction,\r\nbecause that was one of ordinary occurrence, and its limitations well\r\nascertained. On this, in event, the case was dismissed; the court being\r\nof opinion they could not decide a question of title to lands not within\r\ntheir district. My wish had rather been for a full investigation of\r\nthe merits at the bar, that the public might learn, in that way, that\r\ntheir servants had done nothing but what the laws had authorized and\r\nrequired them to do. Precluded now from this mode of justification, I\r\nadopt that of publishing what was meant originally for the private eye\r\nof counsel. The apology for its general complexion, more formal than\r\npopular, must be found as well in the character of the question, as in\r\nthe views with which its discussion had been prepared. The necessity,\r\nindeed, of continuing the elaborate quotations, is strengthened in the\r\ncase of ordinary readers, who are supposed to have still less opportunity\r\nof turning to the authorities from which these are taken.\r\n\r\nThe questions arising, being many and independent of each other, admitted\r\nnot a methodical and luminous arrangement. Proceeding, therefore, in a\r\ncourse of narrative, I have met and discussed the points of law in the\r\norder in which events presented them; thus securing, as we go along, the\r\nground we pass over, and leaving nothing adversary or doubtful behind.\r\nHence the mixture of fact and law which will be observed through the\r\nwhole.\r\n\r\nVouchers for the facts are regularly referred to. These are principally,\r\n1. Affidavits taken and published on the part of the plaintiff, and of\r\nthe city of New-Orleans, very deeply interested in this question. 2.\r\nPrinted statements, by the counsel on each side, uncontradicted by the\r\nother, of facts under their joint observation and knowledge. 3. Records.\r\n4. Notarial acts, and 5.

The original of this grant having been destroyed\r\nin the fire which consumed a great part of the city in 1794,\r\nand no copy of it as yet produced, the extent and character of\r\nthe grant is known from no authentic document. Its other\r\nlimits are unimportant, but that next the river and above the city\r\nis understood to have been of 20 arpents, or acres,\r\n[of 180 French feet, or 64 yards of our measure\r\neach,] 'face au fleuve,' the ambiguity of which expression\r\nis preserved by translating it, 'fronting the river.'\r\nWhether this authorized them to go to the water line of the\r\nriver, or only to the road and levee, is a question of some difficulty,\r\nand not of importance enough to arrest our present attention.\r\nTo these they had added 12 arpents more by purchase\r\nfrom individuals. In 1763 the order of Jesuits was\r\nsuppressed in France, and their property confiscated.\r\nThe 32 arpents, before mentioned, were divided into 6\r\nparcels, described each as 'faisant face au fleuve,' and the one\r\nnext to the city of 7 arpents in breadth, and 50 in\r\ndepth, was sold to Pradel; but how these 7 arpents,\r\nlike Falstaff's men in buckram, became 12 in the\r\nsale of the widow Pradel to Renard, [Report 7.] 13 in Gravier's\r\ninventory, and nearly 17, as is said Derb. viii. ix. in the\r\nextent of his fauxbourg, the plaintiff is called on to show, and\r\nto deduce titles from the crown, regularly down to\r\nhimself. In 1788, Gravier, in right of his wife the\r\nwidow of Renard, laid off the whole extent of his\r\nfront on the river, whatever it was, into 4 ranges of lots, and\r\nin '96 he added 3 ranges more, establishing them as a Fauxbourg,\r\nor Suburb to the city. That this could not be done without\r\npermission from the government may be true; and no formal\r\nand written permission has been produced. Whether such an\r\none was given and lost in the fire, or was only verbal, is\r\nnot known. *But that permission was given must be\r\nbelieved, 1. From Gravier's declaration to Charles Trudeau\r\nthe surveyor, which must operate as an Estoppel [Report\r\n45.] against all contrary pretensions in those claiming under him.\r\n2. From Carondelet's order to Trudeau, first to deposit a copy\r\nof the plan in the public archives, and afterwards an order\r\nfor a second one to be delivered to himself, which implied necessarily\r\nthat he had consented to the establishment; but more\r\nespecially when B. Gravier relying on this establishment as\r\nfreeing him from the repairs of the bank, the Governor declared\r\n'it was true and that Gravier was right.' 3. From the records\r\nof the Cabildo, or town council, with whom the Governor sat\r\nin person, showing that at their sessions on the 1st day of\r\nJanuary annually, for regulating the police of the city, a Commissary\r\nof police for the new quarter was regularly appointed\r\nfrom the year 1796, till the United States took possession. The\r\nactual settlement of the ranges next the river, and the addition\r\nof the new ranges, now probably rendered that necessary. 4.\r\nFrom the conviction expressed by the Surveyor that, from his\r\nknowledge of the laws and customs of the Spanish colonies, no\r\none would have dared to establish a city, bourg, village or fauxbourg\r\nwithout authorization, verbal at least, from the Governor.\r\n5. From the act of the local legislature incorporating the city of\r\nNew Orleans. [Thierry 32.] That no formal written act of\r\nauthorization can be produced is not singular, as that is known\r\nto be the condition of a great proportion of their titles from the\r\ngovernment: and the extraordinary negligence in these titles\r\nwas what rendered it necessary for Congress to establish, in the\r\nseveral territories of Orleans, Mississippi, Louisiana, Indiana and\r\nMichigan, boards of Commissioners, to ascertain and commit\r\nthem to record. To this we may add that the principle which\r\nshall take from the inhabitants of the Suburb St. Mary the validity\r\nof their establishment, will annul a great portion of the\r\nland rights of those several territories. Finally, whatever act of\r\nthe government may be considered as amounting to evidence of\r\nits ratification of the establishment of the fauxbourg, is retrospective,\r\nand will amount to an original authorization under the\r\nmaxim, 'omnis ratihabitio retrotrahitur, et mandato æquiparatur.'\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Gravier's sale.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 7*]\r\n\r\nBertrand Gravier proceeded to sell the lots of his new Fauxbourg,\r\nand particularly he sold the whole range next\r\nthe river. Such deeds for these lots as have been\r\nproduced, describe them as 'haciendo frente al rio,'\r\n'fronting the river.' And it is affirmed, [Examen 13. Poydras\r\n7. and 18. Thierry 39.] that almost all, if not all the deeds, used\r\nthe same expression. [See notarial copies of the deeds of B.\r\nGravier to Nicholas Gravier, and of Nicholas Gravier to\r\nEscot, Girod, *Wiltz.] Bertrand Gravier himself, on all\r\noccasions, [Pieces Probantes 9. 21. 28. 30. Livingston\r\n59. Monile's deposition, MS.] declared that he had sold his lots\r\n'faisant face au fleuve,' and had passed to the purchasers his\r\nright to the _devanture_, meaning every thing in front of his lots.\r\nWhatever extent then towards the river, passed to the Jesuits\r\nby the term 'face au fleuve,' or from the king to the purchasers\r\nof the Jesuit's property, under whom B. Gravier claimed, the\r\nsame extent was, by the same expression,'face au fleuve,' or\r\n'frente al rio,' passed by Bertrand Gravier to the purchasers of\r\nthe front lots. If the words 'face au fleuve,' gave him only to\r\nthe road and levee, he by the same words gave them no farther;\r\nif to the water edge, then he sold to the water edge also, and\r\nhaving parted with all his right as riparian possessor, could\r\ntransmit none to those claiming under him by subsequent title,\r\nas the plaintiff does. In a note added to the end of the printed\r\nReport of this case, whether by the reporter or the plaintiff does\r\nnot appear, it is said that this objection was answered by showing,\r\n_from the deeds_, that each lot had a clear front boundary,\r\nby referring to the '_plan which in no instance crossed the\r\nroad_.' And that this brings it within the rule of law which says,\r\n'in agris limitatis jus alluvionis locum non habere constat.'\r\nDig. 41. 1. 16. This process of deduction, if not clear, is compendious\r\nat least, and better placed in a note, than in the text,\r\nwhere explanation would have been expected. Let us spread it\r\nopen and examine it. What says the deed to Nicholas Gravier\r\nfor 58 lots?\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 8*]\r\n\r\n     Yo Don Beltran Gravier vendo a Don Nicholas Gravier cinquenta\r\n     y ocha terrenos situados en esta dicha ciudad, extramuros de\r\n     la puerta de Chapitulas, à saver, _trece haciendo frente al\r\n     rio_, Missisipi, y lindando por el lado de abaxo, que es de\r\n     esta dicha ciudad, con terreno de Don R.

Trudeau,\r\n     I have delivered to the purchaser for his information and\r\n     ascertainment: Nevertheless, with the condition that I reserve\r\n     to myself the right to take the earth which I shall need for\r\n     my manufacture of bricks on the beach or batture which is in\r\n     the extension of the said 13 lots which front the river.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Streets.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 9*]\r\n\r\nThe first part of this description is of the 13 lots, to wit, that\r\nthey front the river. The second part relates wholly to the remaining\r\n45 lots, which begin beyond or above the first street in\r\na straight line from the lot behind Poydras', and refers to the\r\nplan to show their position more particularly as back lots, behind\r\nthe front range. It is to be noted that the public way in\r\nfront of the fauxbourg is not a street: it is the same chemin\r\nroyale, royal road, which has existed from early times, and has\r\nnever been merged in the character of a street. Nothing can\r\nprove more clearly, that this reference to the plan was not to\r\ngive a front line to the 13 lots, than that the same deed reserves\r\nthe right of digging earth on the batture beyond that line. Now\r\nif nothing was meant to be conveyed _beyond_ the front line marked\r\nin the plan, why reserve a right to dig earth on the batture,\r\nwhich is _beyond_ that line? And that Nicholas Gravier, Escot,\r\nGirod and Wiltz did not consider this line as the limit of their\r\nrights, appears from their deeds conveying the _batture_ expressly\r\nby that name, with the lots themselves. On the whole, we see\r\nhere a curious specimen of tergiversation in reasoning. When\r\nurged that the grant to the Jesuits, and to Bertrand Gravier,\r\nthough expressed to be 'face au fleuve,' must still have stopped\r\nat this line or edge of the royal road, it is answered that those\r\nterms convey to the water edge, and make it an 'ager arcifinius,'\r\nto which the right of alluvion appertains. But when Bertrand\r\nGravier conveys to his purchasers 'face au fleuve,' they turn\r\nabout and say that the same identical words 'face au fleuve,'\r\nconvey now only to this same line or edge of the royal road,\r\nwhich they overleaped before, and make the grounds conveyed\r\nan 'ager limitatus,' to which the right of alluvion does not appertain.\r\nIt is perfectly equal which of the meanings is ascribed\r\nto these words. Only give them the same in both instances,\r\nand say which. If these words make the road your boundary,\r\nyou never had a right to the batture beyond it. If they extend\r\nto the river what was conveyed to _you_, they extend to the\r\nriver also what was conveyed _from you_. Will it be\r\npretended that, after establishing his town, Bertrand\r\nGravier could then have sold the streets to others? and\r\nyet he might, a fortiori, having not included them in any deed.\r\nBut does not common sense and common honesty\r\n*proclaim that the establishment of his town, and sale\r\nof the lots, implied a relinquishment to the inhabitants\r\nof the communications of streets and shores adjacent, as a common,\r\nwhich are the necessary and constant appendages of every\r\ntown? The express conveyance then of his riparian rights, and\r\nthe implication as to them and the streets, are believed to be\r\nconclusive to show that the plaintiff having had no right, can\r\nhave sustained no wrong.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Beach or Batture.]\r\n\r\nIn 1797, Bertrand Gravier died intestate; and at this epoch\r\nwe must introduce what constitutes the sole object of the existing\r\ncontest. Opposite to the habitation or plantation\r\nof B. Gravier, now the Fauxbourg Ste. Marie,\r\nthe beach of the river, called in that country Batture,\r\nof ordinary breadth within memory, has sensibly increased, by\r\ndeposits of earth, during the annual floods of the river, [Derb.\r\nxix.] till in the year 1806, it was found to extend in breadth, at\r\nlow tide, from 122 to 247 yards of our measure, from the water\r\nedge into the river: and from about 7 f. height, where it abuts\r\nagainst the bank, declining to the water edge. See Pelletier's\r\nplan annexed. Thiery xvii. While uncovered, which is from\r\nAugust to January inclusive, it has served as a Quai for lading\r\nand unlading goods, stowing away lumber and firewood, and\r\nhas furnished all the earth for building the city, and raising its\r\nstreets and courts, essential in that oozy soil. Derb. ii. While\r\ncovered, which is during the other six months of the year, from\r\nFebruary to July inclusive, [Liv. 58. Poydras 20. 21. 23.] it is\r\nthe port for all the small craft of the river, and especially for\r\nthe boats of the upper country, which, in the season of high\r\nwater, can land or lie no where else in the neighborhood of the\r\ncity. During this period, they anchor on its bottom, or moor to\r\nits bank. It is then, like every other beach, the bed of the river\r\none half the year, and a Quai the other half, distinguished from\r\nthose of tide waters, by being subject to an annual, instead of a\r\nsemidiurnal ebb and flood. In this beach or shoal, with the bank\r\nto which it is adjacent, if Bertrand Gravier claimed any right,\r\nas riparian proprietor of the habitation, he had certainly meant\r\nto convey that right to the purchasers of the front lots, by the\r\nterm 'frente al rio,' 'fronting the river,' reserving expressly, as\r\nwe have seen, from one purchaser of 58 lots, a right to take\r\nearth, from the beach, for his brickkilns. As he died without\r\nchildren, the inheritance belonged to John Gravier, and other\r\nbrothers and sisters whom he had left in France, or their representatives,\r\nas co-heirs.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Purchase by Inventory.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 10*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 11*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Livingston's arrival.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Parisien.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 12*]\r\n\r\nBy the civil law, if an heir accepts the inheritance,\r\nhe is considered, not merely as the representative, but\r\nas continuing the person of the ancestor himself, is answerable\r\nfor all his debts, and out of all his property, as well his\r\nown, as* what he had newly acquired by the inheritance.\r\nTime, therefore, was allowed him to inform himself of\r\nthe condition of the estate and debts, during which it was considered\r\nas an hæreditas jacens, vested in nobody. If he declined\r\ntaking the inheritance simply as heir, he was allowed to take it\r\nas purchaser, or in their language, as heir with the benefit of\r\ninventory: whereupon an inventory and appraisement of it took\r\nplace, and he had the preëmption at the appraised value. He\r\nwas then liable to no more debts than the amount of the appraisement;\r\nand if there was a surplus of the appraised value\r\nover and above the debts it was his, if a single heir, or partitioned\r\namong the co-heirs, as parceners, if there were more than\r\none. Brown. civ. law, I. 218. 302. Kaim's law tracts, 389.\r\nGibbon's c. 44. 153. Bertrand Gravier is understood to have\r\nleft France indebted and insolvent: and John Gravier, therefore,\r\neither knowing, or ignorant of the amount of the debts,\r\nchose on behalf, or perhaps in defraud, of the co-heirs, to decline\r\nthe inheritance, and to take the estate as a purchaser by inventory\r\nand appraisement. It was inventoried and appraised.\r\nIn the inventory is placed a single article of lands, in these\r\nwords, 'are placed in the inventory the lands of this habitation,\r\nwhose extent cannot be calculated immediately, on account of\r\nhis having sold many lots; but Mr. N. Gravier informs us that\r\nits bounds go to the forks of the bayou, according to the titles.'\r\nAnd in the appraisement also there is but this same single article\r\nof lands, thus described, 'about thirteen arpents of land, of\r\nwhich the habitation is estimated, including the garden, of\r\nwhich the most useful part is taken off in front, the residue\r\nconsisting of the lowest part, [to wit, that descending back to\r\nthe bayou,] the side being sold to Navarro, one Percy, and the\r\nnegro Zambo, a portion of which, &c. estimated at 190 D. the\r\nfront acre, with all the depth, which makes 2470 D.' Then follows\r\nthe adjudication, which adjudges to John Gravier 'the\r\neffects, real estate, moveables and slaves _which have been inventoried_\r\nas belonging to the estate of his deceased brother Bertrand\r\nGravier, &c. Report 9. 10. We see, then, that no lands\r\nwere inventoried but the thirteen arpents in front, composing\r\nthe inhabitation. And it is impossible that that term should be\r\nmeant to include the beach of the river, cut off from it by the\r\nintervention of the whole Fauxbourg of seven ranges of squares;\r\nor that they should not have used a more obvious expression, if\r\nthe idea of the beach had been in their minds. Nobody could\r\nconsider these two parcels, distant and disjointed as they were,\r\nas being one parcel only, one habitation. No man having two\r\nfarms, or two tracts of land, separated by the lands of others,\r\nwould expect that by devising or conveying one, the\r\nother would *pass also. In fact, at that time, neither\r\nJohn Gravier nor any one else, considered the beach as\r\nany part of Bertrand Gravier's estate: and in the appraisement,\r\nthey estimate the front arpents, (that is, fronting on the fauxbourg,)\r\nwith all their depth to the bayou, at 190 dollars, the\r\nfront arpent; contemplating clearly only what was between the\r\nfauxbourg and bayou. Accordingly Fernandez, acting for the\r\nDepositor General, the legal officer in those cases, swears that\r\nhe took charge and possession of all the estate according to the\r\ninventory which had been made from the 28th of June to the\r\n4th of July, 1797; that, in that inventory, the batture never was\r\nmentioned, or heard of, as property of Gravier, nor in charge\r\nof the Depositor, and that, on delivering the estate to John Gravier,\r\nthe batture never was spoken of. It is equally certain that\r\nhad there been an idea that they were smuggling the batture\r\naway, through these proceedings, the citizens of New-Orleans\r\nwould not have been so silent, nor the Governor, the Cabildo\r\nand other Spanish authorities so passive, when so active on all\r\nformer occasions respecting the batture: and that had the batture\r\nbeen under the view of the appraisers, instead of estimating\r\nit at 2470 dollars, conjointly with other thirteen arpents, a very\r\ndifferent sum must have been named. The batture alone is now\r\nestimated at half a million of dollars. But the truth is, that\r\nneither John Gravier, nor any one else, at that day, considered\r\nit but as public property. And for six years ensuing, he never\r\nmanifested one symptom of ownership; until Mr.\r\nLivingston's arrival there from New-York, with the\r\nwharves and slips of that place fresh in his recollection.\r\nThe flesh-pots of Egypt could not suddenly be forgotten,\r\neven in this new land of Canaan. Then John Gravier received\r\nhis inspiration that the beach was his; and is tempted, by one\r\nkind of bargain after another, to try his fortune with it. It was\r\nonly to lend his name, and receive a round sum if anything\r\ncould be made of it. To get over the palpable\r\nomission of it in the inventory and appraisement, they\r\nfind a man whose recollection is exactly à propos; a Henry\r\nParisien, a comedian by profession, and a joiner by trade. He\r\nhad been one of the appraisers, 10 years before, and recollected,\r\nand so swore that he had '_walked on the batture_, before the\r\nclosing of the appraisement to ascertain its extent, and be the\r\nbetter able to judge of its value, and that it was through forgetfulness\r\nthat _it had not been taken into the estimate_.' Piecès Prob.\r\n33. It happens that nature bears witness against him. From\r\nthe 20th of June to the 4th of July is within the period of high\r\nwaters; and it is proved that, at the very time of the appraisement,\r\nthe river was still overflowing, and the batture covered\r\nwith water: *the journals of the sawmills further attest\r\nthat they did not cease to work till the 25th of August\r\nof that year; and when the waters of the river are sufficiently\r\nlow to stop the mills, all the battures are still covered with water.\r\nP. Pr. 34. However even this Henry Parisien swears, '_that\r\nthe batture was not in the estimate_, and that it was through forgetfulness\r\nthat it was not.' Examin 19. Rep. 21. Pi. Prob. 33.\r\nNo matter through what cause, it is enough that it was _not in\r\nthe inventory or estimate_, and of course not sold to J. Gravier.\r\nThis corroborates the testimony of the Depositor, that he neither\r\nhad it in his charge, nor included it in the estate sold and delivered.\r\nJ. Gravier must therefore, as to this part of his brother's\r\nestate, if his it were, recommence his work, by having a new\r\ninventory, appraisement and adjudication. But to repel the\r\npresent proceeding, it suffices that having made his election to\r\ntake, not as heir, but purchaser, this beach is not yet his; it is\r\nstill an hæreditas jacens, and before he can convey it to Mr.\r\nLivingston, he must get it by a new process, and make a third\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 13*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Bigarre.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 14*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Decision of Court.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Alarm occasioned.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Servitude of road.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 15*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 16*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: U. States no party.]\r\n\r\nWe will proceed further to trace the history of this acquisition\r\nof the batture, by the plaintiff, who writes a letter of lamentations\r\nto some member of the government, on the 27th of June, 1809.\r\nThat 'Congress will probably adjourn without coming to any\r\ndecision on the subject of my removal by the late president of\r\nthe United States from my estate at New-Orleans.' A most ungrateful\r\ncomplaint; for had he not been removed, he must, at\r\nthe time of writing this letter, have been, as his estate was, some\r\n10 or 12 feet under water; the river being then at its greatest\r\nheight. And when was this notable discovery made, that the\r\nbeach of the river was the separate and exclusive property of\r\nJ. Gravier, clear of all public right to its use? Let us hear the\r\nGovernor, in answer to this question. In a letter to the Secretary\r\nof State of October 13, 1807, he says, 'early after the arrival\r\nof Mr. Livingston in this territory, he became concerned\r\nin the purchase of a parcel of ground fronting the fauxbourg of\r\nthis city, commonly called the batture, a property which had\r\nbeen occupied as a common by the city for many years previous,\r\nand the title to which, in the opinion of the inhabitants was\r\nunquestionable.' The day[82] of the arrival of Mr. Livingston in\r\nNew-Orleans I do not know; but I recollect he was one of\r\nthe earliest emigrants to that country, which was ceded to the\r\nUnited States on the 30th of October, 1803. We are told, [Rep.\r\n11. Thierry 5.] it was proved by some oral testimony that J.\r\nGravier _began_ an inclosure of 500 feet square in that\r\nyear, and completed it in the next. The day *of beginning\r\nis not stated; but we may safely presume it was not\r\nwhile the French Governor thought the country belonged to his\r\nmaster, and most probably not till after 'the early arrival of Mr.\r\nLivingston.' This enclosure was demolished by an order of\r\nthe Cabildo of Feb. 22, 1804.[83] The next step was to make an\r\nostensible deed, to an ostensible purchaser,[84] a Peter\r\nde la Bigarre, a brother emigrant of Mr. Livingston's\r\nfrom New York, some old acquaintance. This was dated\r\nMarch 27, 1804, is expressed to be in consideration of 10,000\r\ndollars, and conveys two undivided thirds of all that part or\r\nparcel of land, situate on the bank [sur la rive] of the river\r\nMissisipi, between the public road and the current of the said\r\nriver, &c. with a warranty. I call the purchases ostensible, because\r\nnotwithstanding his pretended purchase, J. Gravier, on\r\nthe 20th of October, 1805, [Rep. 1.] commenced a suit against\r\nthe city, as proprietor of the whole, and the court adjudged him\r\nproprietor of the whole; and because the same J. Gravier,\r\n[Poydr. 3.] by a deed to the same P. de la Bigarre, in which no\r\nmention was made of the former, or reference to it, conveys to\r\nhim on the 14th Dec. 1806, the batture Ste. Marie, along the\r\nwhole limits of this land, between the road and river, on condition\r\nthat he shall pay all expenses of the suit depending, with\r\n50,000 dollars in addition; that the property shall remain unsold\r\nand hypothecated for the purchase money till paid, and that if\r\nthe law-suit fails, the sale is void, and Bigarre to pretend to no\r\ndamages for non-execution. It is observable here that neither\r\nbuyer or seller risked anything. It was a mere speculation on\r\nthe chance of a law-suit, in which they were to divide the spoils\r\nif successful, and to lose nothing if they failed.[85] It was by our\r\nlaw a criminal purchase of a pretense title, 32. H. 8. 9. and\r\nequally criminal by the law of that territory, where I presume\r\nthe provision of the Roman law is in force, 'qui improbè coeunt\r\nin alienam litem, ut quidquid ex condemnatione in rem ipsius\r\nredactum fuerit, inter eos commnnicaretur, lege Juliâ, de vi privatâ,\r\ntenentur.' Dig. 47. 8. 6. 4 Blackst. 135. 'Whosoever\r\nshall take part in the suit of another, so that whatever shall be\r\nrecovered by the judgment is to be divided between them, shall\r\nbe subject to the Julian law, de vi privata.' By which law, ib.\r\ntit. 7. § 1. they were to lose one third of their goods, and be\r\nrendered infamous. The deed was not only criminal on its\r\nface, but was void by an express law of the territory, [a law of\r\nGovernor Unzaga. Poydras 6. Rep. 25.] and so pronounced\r\nto be on the floor of Congress *by their representative,\r\nbecause not executed before either witnesses\r\nor notaries. It was kept secret from its date, till the day before\r\njudgment was pronounced, when the parties becoming apprised\r\nof the decision which was to be given, (for this was known\r\nat least on the 20th of May,) [Governor Claiborne's letter May\r\n20, '07,] produced it, for the first time, to the\r\nNotary to be recorded. And the day after its publication,\r\nthe court, by the opinion of two members\r\nagainst one, [Examen 3.] adjudged the property wholly to the\r\nvery man, who, if he had ever had any right, had conveyed away\r\ntwo thirds of it, before he brought his action, and\r\nthe whole while it was pending. The alarm which\r\nthis adjudication produced was immediate and great.\r\nThe fact was notorious that, from the earliest to the latest extension\r\nof the beach, the public had had a free use of it, as\r\ntheir Quai in low water, and in high water their port; and\r\nnever before had their right been doubted by themselves, or\r\nquestioned by their riparian possessors. If any fact was ever\r\nproved by human testimony, this is. Turn to the Pieces Probantes,\r\nand out of 29 affidavits of the oldest and most respectable\r\npersons in the territory, men who had, most of them, borne\r\noffices under their former government, 21 of them uniformly\r\ndeclare that the public had ever been considered as having a\r\nright to the beach, as their port and Quai, that, as such, the\r\nGovernors and Cabildo had the constant care and control of it,\r\nhad demolished buildings and enclosures erected on it, had, by\r\npublic Ban, prohibited all erections or obstructions to its use, had\r\nthemselves erected a rampart, to inclose within it a chamber accessible\r\nfor earth at high water for rebuilding the city after the\r\nfire, and exercised uninterruptedly every other act of authority\r\nderived from the public rights; and 11 of them prove, as far as\r\na negative can be proved, that the Graviers, till the change of\r\ngovernment, and new views by Edward Livingston, had never\r\npretended to more than the right of Common in it, and never\r\nhad questioned that of the public, or the authority of the\r\nGovernor and Cabildo over it. While they held\r\nthe adjacent plantation indeed, they maintained the\r\nroad and bank, as all rural proprietors are obliged\r\nby[86] law to do: for here it is proper to observe, that pursuing the\r\nspirit of the Roman law, which prescribed that every one should\r\nmaintain the public road along his own dwelling, 'construat vias\r\npublicas unusquisque secundum propriam domum.' Dig 43.\r\n10. 3. The lands in Louisiana were granted generally\r\non a condition, (called in those days *_servitude_,) of furnishing\r\nground for a public road, and of opening and\r\nmaintaining that road. From which condition, however, they\r\nwere released as to any portion of the ground which should\r\nafterwards become a town; the expense of roads or streets of\r\nthat portion devolving then on the town itself. Accordingly\r\nB. Gravier, after establishing the front of his plantation into a\r\nsuburb, and thus cutting off the residue from the road and\r\nriver, being[87] called on to repair the road by an order from\r\nGovernor Carondelet, who seems at the moment not to have\r\nadverted to the change, Bertrand Gravier answered, that having\r\nsold the lots _faisant face au fleuve_, fronting the river, he had\r\nabandoned the batture to the town, and that the road and levee\r\ncould not be at his expense, the Governor correcting himself at\r\nonce, says, 'Gravier is right, all this is true,' and immediately,\r\nand ever after had the repairs made by the public. And the\r\nGraviers from that time stood discharged from these burthens\r\non the same principle which had freed the original owners of\r\nthe site of the city from maintaining the banks of the city.\r\nThis is declared by an host of witnesses in the Pieces Probantes,\r\nand probably could have been declared by every ancient\r\ninhabitant of the place. We are told indeed by Laroche and\r\nSegur, in their affidavit, [Livingston 66.] of Carondelet, and\r\nsome other Governor asking leave of Gravier in 1795 and\r\n1798, to deposit masts on the beach. If this be true, which Mr.\r\nThierry, [p. 42.] who knew the witnesses, treats as ridiculous\r\nand absurd, it shows that they were forgetful, or inconsistent,\r\nor over complaisant; but not that Gravier required, or expected\r\nto be asked; and much less could it divest a public right, acknowledged\r\nfrom the earliest times, and essential to the commerce\r\nand existence of the city. An accurate discrimination\r\nindeed between the measure of right in the riparian proprietor\r\nwhile he held the adjacent farm, in the individuals of the nation\r\nas usufructuaries, and in the sovereign as their representative\r\nand trustee, as respectively apportioned to them by the law,\r\nseems not to have been attended to either by the citizens at\r\nlarge, or the adjacent proprietors. The riparian possessor appears\r\nto have been sensible he had some rights, without distinctly\r\nunderstanding what they were: but, whatever they were,\r\nhe knew he had parted with them by the deeds establishing his\r\nfauxbourg. The citizens, in the daily habit of using without\r\ncontrol the port and Quai, imagined themselves exclusive proprietors\r\nof its soil, and came forward in that capacity, claiming,\r\nsometimes under some vague title which they did not define,\r\nand sometimes under the abandonment of right by Bertrand\r\nGravier; *the Sovereign, formerly their kings, but\r\nnow the United States the legal holder of the public\r\nrights in the beds, beaches and banks of all navigable waters,\r\nseems not to have been thought of at all in the contest.\r\nThe United States were no party to the suit;\r\nnor could they be, having made themselves _amenable_\r\nto no tribunal. Their property can never be questioned in any\r\ncourt, but in special cases in which, by some particular law, they\r\ndelegate a special power, as to the boards of Commissioners, and\r\nin some small fiscal cases. But a general jurisdiction over the\r\nnational demenses, being more than half the territory of the\r\nUnited States, has never been by them, and never ought to be,\r\nsubjected to any tribunal. Not adverting to this circumstance,\r\nhowever, the consternation in New-Orleans, on this decision, was\r\nlike that of Boston, on the occlusion of their port by the Boston\r\nport bill. If we have not forgotten that feeling, we may judge\r\nwhat the citizens of New-Orleans felt on this decree of the court.\r\n\r\nThe governor instantly writes, [letter of May 20, '07.] 'I\r\nunderstand that this morning an important cause has been determined,\r\nin which Edward Livingston was the _real_ plaintiff,\r\nand the city defendant, as to the right of property to some lands\r\nin front of the fauxbourg, made by the river, and over which the\r\ncity has heretofore exercised a right of ownership. My impression\r\nis that the United States are the legal claimants to it.' On\r\nthe 21st of August, 1807, Mr. Derbigny's opinion was published,\r\n[Thierry 5.] and first brought into view the right of the United\r\nStates, and that the sentence of the court must of course, as to\r\nthem, be a mere nullity, 'res inter alios acta, quæque aliis non\r\npotest præjudicium facere.' A thing passing between others,\r\nand which to no others can do prejudice. Codex. 7. 60.

The court did not undertake\r\nto decide on the right of the United States, which\r\nwas *neither before them, nor within their competence;\r\nand the injunction they issued could only be addressed\r\nto the parties between whom they had adjudged, and not to\r\nsuspend the rights of others whom they had never heard, much\r\nless of the United States, who could not be heard before them.\r\nSec 2 Dallas 408. 3 Dallas 412. 414. 415.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Livingston's Intrusion.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 18*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Appeal to government of the United States.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 19*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Livingston's works.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 20*]\r\n\r\nPresuming, however, that the coast was now clear, and the\r\nquestion finally settled, the ostensible actors withdrew,\r\nand their principal comes forward, is put into\r\npossession by the Sheriff, and begins his works. The\r\nGovernor, in his letter of Sept. 3, 1807, says, 'a few days since,\r\n[Aug. 24.] Mr. Livingston employed a number of negroes to\r\ncommence digging a canal which he projected to take in a part\r\nof the land called the batture. But the citizens assembled in\r\nconsiderable force and drove them off. On the day following\r\nhe went in person, but was again opposed by the citizens. The\r\nminds of the people were much agitated. The opposition is so\r\ngeneral that I must resort to measures the most conciliatory, as\r\nthe only means of avoiding still greater tumult, and _perhaps\r\nmuch bloodshed_. I have not issued a proclamation because it\r\nmight make an impression in the United States that the people\r\nare disposed for insurrection, which is not true. My opinion is\r\nthat the title is in the United States. If the batture be reclaimed,\r\nit is feared the current of the Missisipi will in some\r\nmeasure change its course, which will not only prove injurious\r\nto the navigation, but may occasion degradation in the levees\r\nof the city, or those in its vicinity.' To abridge our narration\r\nby giving the substance of the communications. The people\r\nassembled the next day about the same hour, and for several days\r\nsuccessively, by beat of drum. [Livingston's letter of Sept. 15.\r\n'07.] On Monday the 31st of August, Mr. Livingston recommenced\r\nhis work, after having given notice that he should do so.\r\nHe began about 10 o'clock, A. M. and about 4 or 5 o'clock in\r\nthe afternoon the people assembled again and drove off his labourers.\r\nOn the 14th of September he again attempted to\r\nwork, getting two constables to attend his labourers. The people\r\ndrove them off, and the constables having noted on a list some\r\nof those present, they seized them, took the list and tore it to\r\npieces. [Sheriff's letter.] On the next day he writes to the\r\nGovernor that he shall set his labourers to work again that day\r\nat 12 o'clock, and 'he shall not be surprised to see the people\r\nchange the insolence of riot into the crime of murder.' At noon\r\nhe accordingly placed 10 or 12 white labourers there. In the\r\nafternoon the people re-assembled to the number of several\r\nhundreds. The governor repaired there and spoke to\r\nthem. He was heard with respectful attention:*and\r\none of them, speaking for the whole, expressed the\r\nserious uneasiness which the decision of the court had excited,\r\nthe long and undisturbed possession of the batture by the city,\r\nas well under the French as the Spanish government, and the\r\ngreat injury which would result to the inhabitants\r\nif the land should be built upon and improved. And\r\nanother declaring that they wished the decision of\r\nCongress, and in the mean time, no work to be done on the batture,\r\nthere was a general exclamation from the crowd, 'that is\r\nthe general wish,' followed by a request that they might nominate\r\nan agent to bear to the President of the United States, a\r\nstatement of their grievances, and that the Governor would recommend\r\nthe agent to the government. He said he would do\r\nso, and they nominated Col. Macarty, by general and repeated\r\nacclamations. They then withdrew in peace to their respective\r\nhomes, and on the 16th the Governor expresses the hope that\r\nthis unpleasant affair is at an end, that everything is then quiet,\r\nand the public mind much composed: that some of his hot-headed\r\ncountrymen censured the mild course which was pursued,\r\nand would have been better pleased if the _military_ had\r\nbeen called upon to disperse the assemblage. But I feel, says\r\nhe, that the policy adopted was wise and humane, and that a\r\ncontrary conduct would have increased the discontents, and\r\n_occasioned the effusion of much innocent blood_. The Louisianians,\r\nhe adds, are an amiable, virtuous people, but sensibly feel\r\nany wrongs which may be offered them. Mr. Livingston is\r\nalike feared and hated by most of the ancient inhabitants. They\r\ndread his talents as a lawyer, and hate his views of speculation,\r\nwhich in the case of the batture was esteemed very generally by\r\nthe Louisianians no less iniquitous, than ruinous to the welfare\r\nof the city.' The governor says in another letter of October\r\n5, to the Secretary of state, that in a progress he made a few\r\ndays afterwards through several parishes of the territory, he\r\nperceived but one sentiment with respect to the decision of the\r\ncourt. The long and uninterrupted use of the batture by the\r\ncity, the sanction given by the Spanish authorities to the public\r\nclaim, and the heavy public expenditures in maintaining the\r\nlevee which fronts it, seem to have given rise to a very general\r\nopinion that the court has been in error in deciding the batture\r\nto be private property. On the 13th of November he again\r\nwrites, 'I should be wanting in duty did I not earnestly recommend\r\nthe subject of the batture to the attention of the\r\ngovernment. There is no doubt but the agents of Spain considered\r\nit as a public property, and did appropriate the same to\r\nthe use of the city, as a common. I should presume that, under\r\nthe treaty, the United States may justly claim the batture,\r\nand if any *means can be devised to arrest the\r\njudgment of the territorial court, or to carry this case\r\nbefore another tribunal, the earlier they are resorted to, the better;\r\nfor Mr. Edward Livingston is now in possession of the property,\r\nand _making improvements thereon_.' And the\r\nnext day, Nov. 14, a grand jury of the most respectable\r\ncharacters of the place gave in a presentment\r\nto the court in which they say, 'We present as a subject of the\r\nmost serious complaint the present operations on the batture\r\nby Edward Livingston and others connected with him: that\r\nthis is from 4 to 6 months of every year a part of the bed of the\r\nriver, and an important part of the port of New-Orleans: that\r\nthese operations of Edward Livingston are calculated to obstruct\r\nthe free navigation of the river, to change the course of\r\nits waters, to deprive our western brethren, whose only market\r\nfor the produce of their extensive territory, is to be found in this\r\ncity, of the deposit which has hitherto remained free to them,\r\nand not only of incalculable importance, but of absolute necessity.\r\nWhether it be private or public property, is immaterial,\r\nso long as the laws do not permit such use of it as to injure\r\nand obstruct the navigation: and we present it as our opinion\r\nthat all such measures should be taken as are consistent with\r\nlaw to arrest these operations which are injurious for the present,\r\nand, in changing the course of the river, are hazardous in\r\nthe extreme.' We find Mr. Livingston then, instead of awaiting\r\nthe decision of Congress, the only constitutional tribunal,\r\nresuming his works boldly, and the people, whom he represented\r\nas like 'to change the insolence of riot into the crime of\r\nmurder,' appealing peaceably, by presentment, to the laws of\r\ntheir territory until the National government should decide. In\r\nthe latter end of the same year, [Surveyor's Rep. to Mayor,\r\nDec. 28, '08.] he opens a canal from the bank directly through\r\nthe beach into the river [88]276 feet long, 64 feet wide, and 4 feet\r\n2 inches deep at low water, and with the earth excavated he\r\nforms a bank or quai, on each side, 19 feet 6 inches wide, from\r\n4 to 6 feet high above the level of the batture, and faced with\r\npalisades. Within one year after this, what had been anticipated\r\nby the Governor, the grand jury and others, had already\r\nmanifested itself. In Dec. of the ensuing year, 1808, [See Surveyor's\r\nrep. Dec. 28, '08.] a bar had already formed across the\r\nmouth of the canal, which was dry at low water, the course of\r\nthe waters had been changed during the intervening flood, and\r\nthe places where dry ground first showed itself, on the decrease\r\nof the river, were such as had, the year before, been navigable\r\nat low water. [Mayor's *answer to Governor,\r\nNov. 18, '08.] The port in front of the town had been\r\nimpaired by a new batture begun to be formed opposite the\r\nCustom house, which could not fail to increase by the change\r\nof the current. The beach or batture of St. Mary had, in that\r\nsingle tide extended from 75 to 80 feet further into the river,\r\nand risen from 2 to 5 feet 10 inches generally, and more in\r\nplaces, as a saw scaffold which, at the preceding low tide, was\r\n7 feet high, was now buried to its top; and Tanesse, the Surveyor,\r\n[See his affidavit, MS.] in his affidavit says he does not\r\ndoubt that these works have produced the last year's augmentation\r\nof the batture, at the expense of the bed of the river,\r\nhave occasioned the carrying away a great part of the platin or\r\nbatture of the lower suburbs, and breaking the levee of M.\r\nBlanque next below, and that the main port of the city being a\r\ncove, immediately below Livingston's works, would, if they\r\nwere continued, be filled up in time; and it is the opinion of\r\nPiedesclaux also, [See his 3d affidavit, MS.] that they would\r\nproduce changes in the banks of the river, on both sides, prejudicial\r\nto the city, and riparian proprietors, by directing the\r\nefforts of the river against parts not heretofore exposed to it.\r\nAnd Mr. Poydras tells us, [p. 20 of one of his speeches,] that\r\nwhen the river is at its height, the boats which drift down it\r\ncan only land in the eddies below the points, as they would be\r\ndashed to pieces in attempting to land in the strong current.\r\nThat, at the town, they cannot land for want of room, there being\r\nalways there two or three tier of vessels in close contact;\r\nnor at the lower suburbs of Marigny, which being at the lower\r\npart of the cove, are too much exposed both to winds and current.\r\nIndeed no evidence is necessary to prove that in a river\r\nof only 1200 yards wide, having an annual tide of 12 to 14 feet\r\nrise, which brings the water generally to within 8 or 10 inches,\r\nand sometimes 2 or 3 inches, of the top of the levee, insomuch\r\nthat it splashes over with the wind, [See Peltier's, and Tanesse's\r\naffidavits, MS. and also the maps,] were the channel narrowed\r\n250 yards, as Mr. Livingston intends, that is to say, a fourth or\r\nfifth of its whole breadth, the waters must rise higher in nearly\r\nthe same proportion, that is to say, 3 feet at least, and would\r\nsweep away the whole levee, the city it now protects, and inundate\r\nall the lower country.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 21*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Cabinet deliberation.]\r\n\r\nThus urged by the continued calls of the Governor, who declared\r\nhe could not be responsible for the peace or preservation\r\nof the place, by the tumult and confusion in which the city was\r\nheld by the bold aggressions of the intruders on the public rights,\r\nby the daily progress of works which were to interrupt the commerce\r\nof the whole western country, threatened to sweep\r\naway a *great city and its inhabitants, and lay the adjacent\r\ncountry under water, I listened to the calls of\r\nduty, imperious calls, which had I shrunk from, I should have\r\nbeen justly responsible for the calamities which would have followed.\r\nOn the 28th of October, '07, the Attorney General had\r\ngiven his opinion, and on the 27th of November,\r\nI asked the attendance of the heads of the departments,\r\nto whom the papers received had been previously\r\ncommunicated for their consideration. We had the\r\nbenefit of the presence of the Attorney General, and of the\r\nlights which it was his office to throw on the subject. We took\r\nof the whole case such views as the state of our information at\r\nthat time presented. I shall now develope them in all the fulness\r\nof the facts then known, and of those which have since\r\ncorroborated them.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: What law?]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Proclamation of O'Reilly.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: French code.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 22*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 23*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Roman.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 24*]\r\n\r\nThe first question occurring was, what system of law was to\r\nbe applied to them? On this there could be but one\r\nopinion. The laws which had governed Louisiana\r\nfrom its first colonization, that is to say, the laws of France with\r\nsome local modifications, were still in force when this question\r\nwas generated by the sale of the Jesuits' property to B. Gravier\r\nand others. France had indeed, about the end of the preceding\r\nyear 1762, by a secret convention, ceded Louisiana to Spain, to\r\nbe delivered whenever Spain should be in readiness to receive it.\r\nBut this was not announced to the inhabitants till the 21st of\r\nApril, 1764, nor did Spain receive possession till the 17th of August,\r\n1769. [9 Raynal, 222. 235.] In the mean time the French\r\ngovernment and laws continued, the Jesuits' property was sold,\r\nand purchased under the faith of the existing laws; and according\r\nto these laws must the rights acquired by the purchaser, or\r\nleft in the crown, be decided. Indeed in no case are the laws of\r\na nation changed, of natural right, by their passage from one to\r\nanother denomination. The soil, the inhabitants, their property,\r\nand the laws by which they are protected go together. Their\r\nlaws are subject to be changed only in the case, and extent which\r\ntheir new legislature shall will. The changes introduced by\r\nSpain, after 1769, were chiefly in the organization of their government,\r\nand but little in the principles of their jurisprudence.\r\nThe instrument which some have understood as suppressing\r\nthe French and introducing the Spanish\r\ncode, is the proclamation of O'Reilly of November\r\n25, 1769, two months after the actual delivery of the colony.\r\n[See appendix to documents communicated to Congress by the\r\nPresident, with his message of October 17, 1803.] The transfer\r\nof the country, however, had been announced to the people five\r\nyears before. Now surely, during these five years\r\nthe *French laws must have continued entire, and\r\nof course after them, so far as not altered. And\r\nthat this proclamation made specific only, and not\r\ngeneral alterations, a brief examination of its tenor\r\nwill evince. It begins by charging the late council with a participation\r\nin the insurrection which had taken place, and by\r\ndeclaring it indispensable to abolish that, and to establish the\r\n_form_ of politic government and administration of justice prescribed\r\nby the wise laws of Spain. But a _form_ of government\r\nmay surely be changed, and the mass of the laws remain the\r\nsame, as took place in our revolution. He proceeds then to establish\r\nthat _form of government_, _dependence_ and _subordination_,\r\nwhich should accord with the good of the service, and happiness\r\nof the colony. For this purpose he substitutes a Cabildo,\r\nin place of the ancient council, and instead of former analogous\r\nofficers, he says there shall be Alferes, Alcades, Alguazils, Depositors,\r\nRegidors, a Scrivener, Procurator, Mayordomo, &c.;\r\nadopting thus the Spanish instead of the French organization\r\nof officers, for the administration of the laws. He changes the\r\nmanner of proceedings in judicial trials, and of pronouncing judgments,\r\naccording to a digest made by Unestia and Rey, by his\r\norder, _until_ a general knowledge of the Spanish language and\r\nmore extensive information on the statutes themselves might be\r\nacquired; prescribes rules for instituting actions by parties, of\r\ndifferent denominations, the names and substance of the pleadings,\r\nrules for appearances, answers, replications, rejoinders, depositions,\r\nwitnesses, exceptions, trials, judgments, appeals, executions,\r\ntestaments, probates, advancements, and distributions: not\r\nchanging the great outlines of the law, or the ratio decidendi\r\ngenerally; but merely the organization of officers, and forms of\r\ntheir proceeding. He states also the criminal law, what it is in\r\nsundry cases of irreligion, treason, murder, theft, rape, adultery,\r\nand trespass, proclaiming mostly what was already law; lastly,\r\nhe establishes the fees of officers, and with that closes the proclamation,\r\nwithout a word said about abolishing the French, and\r\nsubstituting the Spanish code of laws generally. As far then as this\r\ninstrument makes any special changes, its authority is acknowledged.\r\nBut the very act of making special changes is a manifestation\r\nthat a general one was not then intended. He did not\r\nmean by this instrument to change 'all and some.' One may\r\nindeed conjecture, from loose expressions in the instruments, that\r\na more extensive change was in contemplation for some future\r\ntime, when the inhabitants, as it says, should have acquired a\r\ngeneral knowledge of the Spanish language. But _until_ then\r\nexpressly, and in the interim, the innovations it specifies are\r\nthe only ones introduced. The great system of law which\r\n*regulates property, which prescribes the rights of persons and\r\nthings, and sanctions to every one the enjoyment of those\r\nrights, is left untouched, in full force and authority. If such\r\na radical change were really meditated, it was never carried\r\ninto execution; nor seems at any after time to have occupied\r\nseriously the attention of government. In the following year\r\n1770, O'Reilly issued an additional ordinance respecting grants\r\nof lands; and Carondelet, in 1795, (26 years after the possession\r\nof the colony, and a year only before its transfer to us,) passed\r\nan ordinance of police, concerning bridges, roads, levees, slaves,\r\ncoasters, travellers, arms, estrays, fishing and hunting; and these\r\nthree acts seem to constitute the whole of the changes made in\r\nthe established system of laws during the Spanish occupation of\r\nthe country. Probably the Spanish authorities found, in the\r\nprogress of their administration, that the difference between the\r\nFrench and Spanish codes, taken both from the same Roman\r\noriginal, would not justify disturbing the public mind, by a formal\r\nsuppression of the one, and substitution of the other. Probably\r\nthe officers themselves, not adepts in either, and partly French,\r\nand partly Spanish individuals, confounded them in practice as\r\nthey found convenient; and hence the ill-defined ideas of what\r\ntheir laws were. But certainly when we appeal, as in the present\r\ncase, to exact right, the French code is the only one sanctioned\r\nby regular authority; and the special changes before mentioned,\r\nof organization and police, having no relation to the beds\r\nand increments of rivers, that code is to give us the law of the\r\npresent case. That code, like all those of middle and southern\r\nEurope, was originally feudal, [Encyclop. Method. Jurisprudence.\r\nCoutume. 400.] with some variations in the different provinces,\r\nformerly independent, of which the kingdom of France had\r\nbeen made up. But as circumstances changed, and civilization\r\nand commerce advanced, abundance of new cases and questions\r\narose, for which the simple and unwritten laws of\r\nfeudalism had made no provision. At the same\r\ntime, they had at hand the legal system of a nation highly civilized,\r\na system carried to a degree of conformity with natural\r\nreason attained by no other. The study of this system too was\r\nbecome the favorite of the age, and, offering ready and reasonable\r\nsolutions of all the new cases presenting themselves, was\r\nrecurred to by a common consent and practice; not indeed as\r\nlaws, formally established by the legislator of the country, but as\r\na RATIO SCRIPTA, the dictate, in all cases, of that sound reason\r\nwhich should constitute the law of every country.[89] Over\r\nboth of these systems, however, the occasional* edicts of\r\nthe monarch are paramount, and amend and control their\r\nprovisions whenever he deems amendment necessary; on the\r\ngeneral principle that 'leges posteriores priores abrogant.'[90] Subsequent\r\nlaws abrogate those which were prior. This composition\r\nof the French code is affirmed by all their authorities.\r\nOne only of them shall be particularly cited, to wit, Ferriere\r\nDict. de droit. Ordonnance.\r\n\r\n     'Les Ordonnances sont les vraies lois du royaume. Elles\r\n     font la partie la plus générale et la plus certaine de notre\r\n     droit Français, attendu qu'elles sont soutenues de l'autorité\r\n     aussi bien que de la raison; au lieu que les loix Romaines ne\r\n     subsistent que par leur équité, elles n'ont par elles-mêmes\r\n     aucune autorité, qu'autant qu'elles sont considérées comme\r\n     une raison écrite, du moins en pays coutumier; et à l'égard du\r\n     pays de droit écrit, les loix Romaines n'y ont force de loi,\r\n     que parceque nos rois ont bien voulu y consentir.'\r\n\r\n     The Ordinances are the true laws of the kingdom. They constitute\r\n     the most general and certain part of our French law, inasmuch\r\n     as they are supported by authority as well as reason; whereas\r\n     the Roman laws stand on their equity alone, having of themselves\r\n     no authority, but as they are considered as _written reason_,\r\n     at least in the provinces of Customary law. And as to those\r\n     of written law, the Roman laws are in force only because our\r\n     kings have thought proper to consent to it.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 25*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 26*]\r\n\r\nThis system of law was transferred to Louisiana, as is evinced\r\nby the [91]charter of Louis XIV. to Crozat, bearing date\r\nthe *14th of Sept. 1712. The VIIth article of that is in\r\nthese words. 'Our edicts, ordinances and customs, and\r\nthe usages of the Mayorality and Shreevalty of Paris, shall be\r\nobserved for laws and customs in the said country of Louisiana.'\r\nThe customary law of Paris seems to have been selected, because\r\nconsidered as the best digest, and that to which it was proposed\r\nto reduce the customary law of all the provinces. Enc.\r\nMeth. Jurispr. Coutume. 405. This is the first charter we know\r\nof which established the boundaries and laws of Louisiana. It\r\nsays nothing of the Roman law; but that, having become incorporated,\r\nby usage, with the customs of Paris, and constituting, as\r\na supplement, one system with them, seems to have been considered\r\nas of their body, and transferred with them to Louisiana.[92]\r\nIn 1717, Crozat transferred his rights to the Compagnie d'Occident,\r\nat the head of which was the famous Law, 8. Raynal.\r\n166. [edit. 1780.] which again in 1720, by union with others,\r\nbecame the Compagnie des Indes, who in 1731, surrendered the\r\ncolony back to the king. 1. Valin, 20. But these various transfers\r\nfrom company to company, of the monopoly of their commerce,\r\nfor that was the sum of what was granted them, and their\r\nfinal surrender to the king, could not affect the rights of the\r\npeople, nor change the laws by which they were governed. When\r\nthey returned to the immediate government of the king, their\r\nlaws passed with them, and remained in full force until, and so\r\nfar only as, subsequently altered by their legislator. That\r\nthis was the sense of their *government may be inferred\r\nfrom a clause in the edict creating the Compagnie des\r\nIndes Occidentales, art. 34.\r\n\r\n     'Seront les juges établis en tous les dits lieux tenus de juger\r\n     suivant les lois et ordonnances du royaume, et les officiers de\r\n     suivre et se conformer à la coutume de la Prevôté et vicomté\r\n     de Paris, suivant laquelle les habitans pourront contracter,\r\n     sans que l'on y puisse introduire aucune autre coutume, pour\r\n     éviter la diversité. 1.

Moreau de St. Mery, 100.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Alluvion.]\r\n\r\nThis then is the system of law by which the legal character\r\nof the facts of the case is now to be tested: and the\r\nplaintiff and his counsel having imagined that, in the\r\nRoman branch of it, they had found a niche in which they could\r\nplace the batture to great advantage, have availed themselves of\r\nit with no little dexterity, and by calling it habitually an alluvion,\r\nhave given a general currency to the idea that it is really an alluvion:\r\ninsomuch that even those who deny their inferences,\r\nhave still suffered themselves carelessly to speak of it under that\r\nterm. Were we, for a moment to indulge them in this misnomer,\r\nand to look at their claim as if really an alluvion one, the\r\nfalse would be found to avail them as little as the true name.\r\nThe Roman law indeed says, 'quod per alluvionem agro tuo\r\nflumen adjecit, jure gentium, tibi adquiritur.'

Chez eux le lit, et les bords des fleuves et rivières\r\n     étaient censés faire partie des héritages riverains; et par une\r\n     suite de ces maximes, le terrain qu'un fleuve ajoutait à ces\r\n     héritages, appartenait à ceux qui en étaient propriétaires.\r\n     Ils réunissaient de même à leurs possessions le lit que le\r\n     fleuve abandonnait; et lorsqu'il se formait une île dans le\r\n     milieu de son lit, les riverains y avaient un droit égal,\r\n     et en partageaient la propriété. Suivant nos principes, les\r\n     rivières navigables, leur lit, rives, et tous les terrains\r\n     qui peuvent s'y former, appartiennent au roi, à raison de sa\r\n     souveraineté. C'est la disposition précise de l'article 41.\r\n     du tit. 37 de l'Ordonnance des eaux et forêts de 1669, qui\r\n     a dissipé tous les doutes que l'on cherchait à faire naître\r\n     dans plusieurs provinces, sur les fondemens des énonciations\r\n     qui se rencontraient dans les anciennes concessions.\r\n\r\n     'We do not admit, as the Romans, alluvions and accumulations\r\n     to go to the riparian proprietors, either by changes which\r\n     may happen in the bed of rivers, or relating to isles, and\r\n     islets which may there be formed. With them the bed and borders\r\n     of rivers and streams were considered as making part of the\r\n     riparian inheritances; and as a consequence of these maxims, the\r\n     earth which a river added to these inheritances, belonged to\r\n     those who were the proprietors of them. They reunited in like\r\n     manner to their possessions the bed which a river abandoned,\r\n     and when an isle was formed in the middle of its bed, the\r\n     riparians had an equal right to it, and divided the property.\r\n     According to our principles, navigable streams, their bed,\r\n     banks, and all the grounds which may be formed there, belong\r\n     to the king, in right of his sovereignty. It is the precise\r\n     provision of art. 41. tit. 37. of the Ordonnance des eaux et\r\n     forêts, which has dissipated all the doubts which they had\r\n     endeavored to raise in several provinces, on the grounds of\r\n     the enunciations which were found in the ancient concessions.'\r\n     Cited Derbigny 23.\r\n\r\nAgain, after laying down the Roman law of alluvion, and of\r\nislands formed in the beds of rivers, Le Rasle, in the law Dictionary,\r\nforming a part of the Encyclopédie Méthodique. Jurisprud.\r\naccession. 94, says,\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 28*]\r\n\r\n     'Nous n'avons pas suivi dans notre droit Français les\r\n     *dispositions Romaines à cet égard; toutes les isles ou autres\r\n     attérissemens qui se forment dans les rivières appartiennent\r\n     au roi, et font partie du domaine. Les terres ajoutées par\r\n     alluvion aux héritages baignés par le fleuve et les rivières\r\n     navigables, n'appartiennent aux riverains, que lorsqu'ils out\r\n     un titre de concession qui leur permet de se les approprier.'\r\n\r\n     'We have not in our French law followed the Roman provisions\r\n     in this respect; all islands or other accumulations which are\r\n     formed in rivers, belong to the king, and constitute a part of\r\n     the domain. Lands added by alluvion to inheritances washed by\r\n     rivers and navigable streams, do not belong to the riparians\r\n     but when they have a deed of concession which permits them to\r\n     appropriate them to themselves.'\r\n\r\nAnd Ferriere, quoted also by the plaintiff, says,\r\n\r\n     'Pour ce qui regarde l'augmentation arrivée à un héritage\r\n     subitement et tout d'un coup, la décision que les loix Romaines\r\n     ont faites à cet égard n'est point observée dans le royaume.\r\n     Cette augmentation appartient au roi, dans les rivières\r\n     navigables.' And Denizert agrees, 'que les attérissements\r\n     formés subitement dans le mer, ou dans les fleuves ou rivières\r\n     navigables, appartiennent au roi, par le seul titre de sa\r\n     souveraineté.'\r\n\r\n     'As to augmentations happening suddenly and all at once, the\r\n     decision of the Roman laws in this respect, is not observed\r\n     in the kingdom. These augmentations belong to the king in\r\n     navigable rivers.' And Denizert agrees, 'that atterrissements\r\n     formed suddenly in the sea, or the navigable rivers or streams,\r\n     belong to the king in the sole right of his sovereignty.'\r\n\r\nAnd he refers to the edicts of 1683. 1693. and 1710.\r\n\r\nAnd to put aside all further question as to the law of France on this\r\nsubject. Louis XIV. by an edict of December 15, 1693, says,\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 29*]\r\n\r\n     'Louis, &c. salut. Le droit de propriété que nous avons sur\r\n     tous les fleuves et rivières navigables de notre royaume,\r\n     et conséquemment de toutes les isles, moulins, bacs, &c.\r\n     attérissemens et accroissemens formés pas les dites fleuves\r\n     et rivières, étant incontestablement établi par les lois de\r\n     l'état, comme une suite et une dépendence nécessaire de notre\r\n     souveraineté, les rois nos prédecesseurs et nous, avons de\r\n     tems en tems, ordonné des recherches des isles et crémens qui\r\n     s'y sont formés, &c. A ces causes, de l'avis de notre conseil\r\n     et de notre certaine science, pleine puissance et autorité\r\n     royale, nous avons par ces *présentes, signées de notre main,\r\n     dit, statué et ordonné, disons, statuons et ordonnons, voulons\r\n     et nous plait, que tous les détenteurs, propriétaires, ou\r\n     possesseurs des îles, îlots, attérissemens, accroissemens,\r\n     _alluvions_, droits de pêche, péages, ponts, moulins, bacs,\r\n     coches, bateaux, édifices et droits sur les rivières navigables\r\n     de notre royaume, qui rapporteront des titres de propriété ou\r\n     de possession, avant le 1er Avril, 1566, y soient maintenus\r\n     et conservés dans leurs possessions, en payant au fise une\r\n     année, et ceux sans titre, ni possession antérieurs au 1er\r\n     Avril, 1566, en payant deux années de revenu.'\r\n\r\n     'Louis, &c., Greeting. The right of property which we have\r\n     in all rivers and navigable streams of our kingdom, and\r\n     consequently in all the isles, mills, ferries, &c. accumulations\r\n     and increments formed by the said rivers and navigable streams,\r\n     being incontestably established by the laws of the state, as\r\n     a necessary consequence and dependence of our sovereignty,\r\n     the kings, our predecessors, and ourselves, have from time\r\n     to time ordered inquiries as to isles and increments therein\r\n     formed, &c. For these causes, with the advice of our council,\r\n     and of our certain knowledge, full power and royal authority,\r\n     we have by these presents, signed with our hand, declared,\r\n     enacted and ordained, and we do declare, enact and ordain, we\r\n     will, and it is our pleasure that all the holders, proprietors,\r\n     or possessors, of isles, islets, accumulations, increments,\r\n     _alluvions_, rights of fishery, tolls, bridges, mills, ferriers,\r\n     packets, bateaux, edifices and imposts on the navigable rivers\r\n     of our kingdom which shall produce titles of property or of\r\n     possession before the 1st of April, 1566, shall be therein\r\n     maintained and secured in their possessions, on paying to the\r\n     treasury one year's revenue, and those without title papers,\r\n     or possession prior to the 1st of April, 1566, on payment of\r\n     two years' revenue.'\r\n\r\nHaving no copy of this Ordinance, I quote it from Mr. Derbigny,\r\np. 20. Duponçeau, p. 10. and l'Examen de la Sentence,\r\np. 8, by putting together the parts they cite, for neither gives\r\nthe whole of what I have cited. Other respectable authorities\r\nmight be produced, to the same effect, were it necessary to multiply\r\nthem: and it is also admitted that authorities of weight, and\r\nof a different aspect exist, among these is Dumoulin, as respectable\r\nas Pothier, Guyot, or any other who has been cited. Were\r\nit absolutely incumbent on me, more than on those who rely on\r\nthe contrary authorities, to assign reasons for a difference of\r\nopinion among lawyers, on any point, it might be ascribed in this\r\ncase to a difference of impression from views on the same subject,\r\ndiversified as were the customs of the various provinces of\r\nFrance, on this very point. Dumoulin wrote a century and a\r\nhalf before the Ordinance of Louis XIV. In that course of time\r\nprinting had become more diffused, books greatly multiplied,\r\nand a more correct collation of these customs could be made.\r\nSo that had Dumoulin written in the days of Pothier and Guyot,\r\nand with their advantages, he would probably have concurred in\r\nthe preceding observation, that, 'if there were any doubts, this\r\nOrdinance has dissipated them.' Be this as it may, Louis XIV.\r\nand his council have decided between these two opinions, and if\r\nit were not law before, his decision made it so. By this edict he\r\ndeclares the law of France, 'incontestably,' to be that '_Alluvions_\r\nbelong to the king in all navigable rivers.' But with a spirit*\r\nof indulgence, meriting more respect than he has found\r\nin the language of the adverse party who dislike the truths\r\nhe has declared, he confirmed all anterior usurpations,\r\non payment of certain compositions and future rents, re-establishing,\r\nby the example, the authority of the laws, and rights of\r\nthe crown against these usurpations. This Ordinance was passed\r\n19 years before the charter to Louisiana, and consequently was\r\ncomprehended among the edicts and ordinances originally established\r\nas the law of the Province.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 30*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 31*]\r\n\r\nMr. Livingston and his advocates have asserted that the right\r\nto the beds and increments of rivers, is a gift of the feudal system\r\nto the sovereign, that is, to the nation, and is a peculiarity\r\nof that system: and further, that that system was never introduced\r\ninto Louisiana. That the latter assertion is palpably erroneous,\r\ncould be readily shown, were not the question altogether\r\nunnecessary. With respect to the former, surely it is putting the\r\ncart before the horse to say, that the authority of the nation flows\r\nfrom the Feudal system, instead of the Feudal system flowing\r\nfrom the authority of the nation. That the lands within the\r\nlimits assumed by a nation belong to the nation as a body, has\r\nprobably been the law of every people on earth at some period\r\nof their history. A right of property in moveable things is admitted\r\nbefore the establishment of government. A separate\r\nproperty in lands not till after that establishment. The right to\r\nmoveables is acknowledged by all the hordes of Indians surrounding\r\nus. Yet by no one of them has a separate property in lands\r\nbeen yielded to individuals. He who plants a field keeps possession\r\ntill he has gathered the produce, after which one has as\r\ngood a right as another to occupy it. Government must be established\r\nand laws provided, before lands can be separately appropriated,\r\nand their owner protected in his possession. Till then\r\nthe property is in the body of the nation, and they, or their\r\nchief as their trustee, must grant them to individuals, and determine\r\nthe conditions of the grant. In certain countries, they have\r\ngranted them on a system of conditions and principles which\r\nhave acquired the appellation of Feudal. Surely then it is the\r\nsovereign which has created the Feudal principles, and not these\r\nprinciples which have created the rights of the sovereign. The\r\nEdinburgh Reviewers, [No. 30. 339. Jan. 1810.] who in the progress\r\nof their work have deservedly attained a high standing in\r\nthe public estimation, reviewing the condition of land-tenures\r\namong the Hindoos, say, 'the territory of the nation, belonging\r\nin common to the nation, belongs, in this general sense, to the\r\nking, as the head and representative of the nation. As far accordingly\r\nas we have sufficient documents respecting rude\r\nnations*, we find their kings, _without perhaps a single\r\nexception_, recognized as the sole proprietors of the soil.'\r\nAnd they quote as their authorities,\r\n\r\n     In Europe.\r\n\r\n     For Wales, Leges Walliæ. c. 337.\r\n\r\n     Great Britain.

In\r\ngranting appropriations, some sovereigns have given away the\r\nincrements of rivers to a greater, some to a lesser extent, and\r\nsome not at all. Rome, which was not feudal, and Spain and\r\nEngland which were, have granted them largely; France, a\r\nfeudal country, has not granted them at all on navigable rivers.\r\nLouis XIV. therefore was strictly correct when in his edict of\r\n1693, he declared that the increments of rivers were incontestably\r\nhis, _as a necessary consequence of the sovereignty_. That is\r\nto say, that where no special grant of them to an individual could\r\nbe produced, they remained in him, as a portion of the original\r\nlands of the nation, or as new-created lands, never yet granted\r\nto any individual. They are unquestionably a regalian, or national\r\nright, paramount, and pre-existent to the establishment of\r\nthe feudal system. That system has no fixed principle on the\r\nsubject, as is evident from the opposite practices of different\r\nfeudal nations. The position, therefore, is entirely unfounded,\r\nthat the right to them is derived from the feudal law; and it is\r\nconsequently unnecessary to go into the proof of what\r\nthe grants in that country *exhibit palpably enough, that\r\ninfeudations were partially at least, if not generally, introduced\r\ninto Louisiana.\r\n\r\nIt ought here to be observed however that, so far as respects\r\nthe beds and navigation of rivers, the right vested in the sovereign\r\nis a mere trust, not alienable. It is not like lands, imposts,\r\ntaxes, an article of public property constituting the revenues of\r\nthe state, but like roads, canals, public buildings, reserved for\r\nthe use of the individuals of the nation. See an explanation of\r\nthis subject, Vattel 1. 235. 239.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: M. Thierry.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 33*]\r\n\r\nI have now to advert, and I do it with extreme regret, to a\r\npassage in the very able Memoire of M. Thierry, a\r\nMemoire conspicuous for its learning and sound reasoning,\r\nand to which I acknowledge myself peculiarly indebted\r\nfor information on the points he has discussed. He says, p. 30.\r\n'To the ancestors of John Gravier the right of alluvion belonged,\r\nnot only by virtue of the Coutumes de Paris, which for two centuries\r\nback acknowledged the principle of the Roman law, and\r\nagainst which, for that reason, the Ordinances of the kings of\r\nFrance could with no manner of success be pleaded, inasmuch\r\nas a royal ordinance specially made that Coutume the civil law\r\nof this colony; but also by virtue of the Spanish laws, which\r\nfrom 1769, have been constantly in force in Louisiana.' 1. That\r\nthe Roman principle of Alluvion was acknowledged by the Coutumes\r\nde Paris has not been proved. The adverse counsel,\r\n[Dupon. p. 9.] has said indeed, that those Customs were silent on\r\nthis subject. But I have considered Pothier, Guyot, and Le\r\nRasle as better authority. 2. Mr. Thierry supposes that a Royal\r\nOrdinance having specially made that Coutume the civil law of\r\nLouisiana, the Ordinances of the kings of France were excluded\r\nfrom the system, and could not control what was Coutume.\r\nHe had not, I presume, seen the charter of 1712, which makes\r\nthe edicts and _ordinances_, with the Coutume de Paris, the law\r\nof that province; nor sufficiently considered that had the Coutumes\r\nbeen alone established by one ordinance, another might\r\nchange them. 3. He supposes the Spanish laws have given Alluvions\r\nto the riparian proprietor. But the laws of the province,\r\nestablished by their charter, were not annulled by the change of\r\none king for another, as their legislator. The latter might change\r\nthem. But has he done so? If he has, his edict must be produced,\r\nthat we may weigh its words, and judge of its effects\r\nfor ourselves. And we must guard against admitting that the\r\nexample of a Spanish Governor, if such example has occurred,\r\noccasionally and incorrectly acting on the laws of Spain, amounted\r\nto a repeal of the whole system then existing, and a formal\r\nestablishment of a different one. No such intention on\r\nhis part, *to make so momentous a change, should be so\r\nslightly inferred; and no power of his could effect it,\r\neven if intended. Nothing less than an Ordinance of the Sovereign\r\nhimself, signed with his own hand, and sanctioned by all\r\nthe solemnities attending their enactment and promulgation, was\r\ncompetent to reverse at once the legal condition of a whole\r\npeople, and the laws under which their lives and properties were\r\nheld. Again, even such an ordinance could not change the law\r\nas to past rights; and those now in question were vested before\r\nthe Spanish government took place, and could not be annulled\r\nby a subsequent law. These gratuitous admissions, therefore, of\r\nMr. Thierry, not at all necessary to his argument, and therefore\r\nprobably not well considered, and in opposition to the opinions\r\nand demonstrations of an able brother counsellor (Mr. Derbigny),\r\nmust be disavowed, and the authority of the Ordinance\r\nof 1693 insisted on with undiminished confidence. Mr. Thierry\r\nhimself will perhaps the more readily abandon them, when he\r\nsees with what avidity his eagle-eyed adversary has pounced\r\nupon them in a letter to some member of the government, in\r\nwhich he considers them as giving up all ground of opposition\r\nto his claims.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Edict of Louis XIV.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 34*]\r\n\r\nTo that edict then I shall now recur; and to the cavils raised\r\nagainst it by the advocates of the claims it annihilates.\r\nIt is idle for them to call it bursal, fiscal, and\r\nthe act of a tyrant, &c. [Duponc. 10.] as if the\r\nauthority of laws was to be graduated by the character of the existing\r\nlegislator; and as if we were to be the judges, for other\r\nnations, of the character and obligation of their laws. It is vain\r\nto pretend that because the word 'Alluvion,' inserted in the enacting\r\nclause of the edict, is not in the preamble, therefore it has no\r\nforce in the body of the law: as if the preface, giving the general\r\nreason and views of the law, was alone to be the law, and its\r\nactual enactments a mere nullity. Although the preamble of a\r\nstatute is considered as a key to open the mind of the makers as\r\nto the mischiefs in their view, yet in general it is no more than\r\na recital of some inconveniences, which does not exclude any\r\nother for which the enacting clauses provide; nor must the\r\ngeneral words of an enacting clause be restrained by the particular\r\nwords of the preamble. 6. Bac. Abr. Statute. I. 2. and the\r\nauthorities there stated. So says our law; so says reason; and\r\nso must say the Roman law, if it be ratio scripta. But it is\r\nfurther to be observed that the words 'attérrissements and accroissements,'\r\naccumulations and increments, used in this preamble\r\nare generic terms, of which 'Alluvion' is a species, and\r\ntherefore strictly comprehended by it. This is proved\r\nby the Roman definition, 'Alluvio est _incrementum_*\r\nlatens,' 'alluvion est un accroissement ou crement imperceptible,'\r\nby the Napoleon code cited by Mr. Livingston:\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Napoleon Code.]\r\n\r\n     'Les attérissements et accroissements qui se forment\r\n     successivement et imperceptiblement aux fonds riverains d'un\r\n     fleuve, ou d'une rivière, s'appellent Alluvion.' §. 556\r\n\r\n     'The accumulations and increments which form themselves\r\n     successively and imperceptibly against the riparian lands of\r\n     a river or stream are called Alluvion.' Sect. 556.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Portalis.]\r\n\r\nAnd by the edicts of 1686 and 1689, both of which have the\r\nexpression '_crémens_ qui s'y sont formés, soit par _alluvion_,\r\nou par industrie, &c.' And here Portalis's\r\nrhetorical flourish, on presenting this law, is cited, [Duponc. 17.\r\nLiv. 22.] with triumph, as declaring that this law terminates\r\nthe great question of Alluvion, and decides it conformably to\r\nthe Roman law. It is very true indeed that it has terminated\r\nthe question as to future cases, by changing the law, by transferring\r\nthe right of Alluvion from the sovereign to the riparian proprietor,\r\nby giving the abandoned bed of a river, as an indemnification\r\nto him on whose land it has opened a new passage, and\r\nmaking this the future law of all the provinces. And had Louisiana\r\nthen been subject to France, the law would have been\r\nchanged _thenceforward_, for Louisiana also. I find no fault with\r\nNapoleon for this Roman predilection. I believe the change is\r\nfor the better, so far as concerns rural possessions. A decision\r\ntoo of the parliament of Bordeaux is quoted by Mr. Duponceau\r\n19. to prove that the law giving Alluvion to the adjacent possessor\r\nhas been acknowledged in France by the decision of the parliament\r\nof Bordeaux, confirmed, _as he has heard_, on appeal by\r\nthe parliament of Paris. This proves only that the Roman law\r\nof alluvion was the law of the Generality of Bordeaux, not that\r\nit was then the law of all France. In the country called the\r\nBordelois, Customary laws prevail. But\r\n\r\n     'Lorsque la coutume de Bordeaux ne s'est pas expliquée sur\r\n     certains points de droit, ce n'est ni à la coutume de Paris,\r\n     ni à d'autres coutumes qu'on a recours pour les faire décider,\r\n     mais au droit écrit.' Enc. Meth. Jurisp. Bordeaux.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     'When the Custom of Bordeaux has not sufficiently explained\r\n     itself on certain points of law, it is neither to the Customs of\r\n     Paris, nor to other customs that recourse is had for decision,\r\n     but to the written law,' that is, the Roman law.\r\n\r\nThe inference then is, either that the Coutume de Bordeaux was\r\nthe same on this point as the Roman law, or, that being silent,\r\nthe Roman law was referred to.[93]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 35*]\r\n\r\n*Surely never was the urgency of squeezing argument\r\nout of everything so apparent, as in the emphasis with\r\nwhich the adverse party presses and comments, [Liv. 32.] on the\r\nanswers of the several tribunals, to which the Napoleon Code\r\nwas referred for consideration and amendment. A dozen tribunals\r\nare named, with an &c. for more, who are acknowledged to have\r\nsaid nothing about alluvion: and this is produced as proof that it\r\nhad belonged before to the riparian proprietor. But it proves\r\nmore probably that these tribunals were contented with the\r\nchange proposed, and had no amendment of it to offer. But, in\r\ntruth, it proves nothing either the one way or the other. The\r\ntribunal of Paris is then quoted, with an acknowledgment that\r\nthey do not make a single observation on the subject. Then long\r\nextracts from that of Rouen, proposing that _islands_, rising in the\r\nrivers, shall be given to the riparian proprietors: and recommendations\r\nto the same effect from those of Toulouse and Lyons.\r\nNow it is remarkable that neither the word 'Alluvion,' nor the\r\nidea of the thing, is either expressed or referred to in any one of\r\nthese quotations. And yet Mr. Livingston says, 'we find all\r\nthese learned men either passing over these articles, as merely\r\ndeclaratory of the old law, or else _expressly acknowledging them_\r\nas such;' and again after the citation from Rouen, 'here we have\r\nthe positive declaration of a learned tribunal, &c. deciding that\r\nthe edicts did not extend to alluvions, but only to islands in navigable\r\nrivers.' And yet I repeat that neither the word nor the\r\nidea is to be found in any one of the quotations; for it is of\r\nthese only I can speak, not possessing the book, but I presume\r\nMr. Livingston's quotations are of the strongest passages. It is\r\nimpossible to characterize such reasoning respectfully. I shall\r\ntherefore leave it to the reflection of others. And I think myself\r\nauthorized to conclude on the whole, that had the Batture\r\nbeen really an Alluvion, its ownership was to be decided by the\r\nlaws of France; and that Louis XIV. with the advice of his\r\ncouncil, certainly knew when they declared what the law of their\r\ncountry 'incontestably' was; and if we, with our scanty reading\r\non the subject, at this day and distance, know better than they\r\ndid, yet the enacting clause of the edict made it the law _thenceforward_;\r\nthat it came over as law for Louisiana, made the batture,\r\nif an alluvion, the property of the sovereign; and certainly the\r\nwhole tenor of the conduct of the Spanish government proved\r\nthat they did not mean to relinquish it.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 36*]\r\n\r\nBefore we quit this branch of the discussion, it is not amiss to\r\n*observe that the eloquent declamations of these learned\r\nmen of Rouen, so much eulogized by Mr. Livingston,\r\nwere not at all heeded. The Napoleon code, §. 560.\r\nretained the _islands_ rising in the beds of navigable or floatable\r\nrivers, and (changing the French law only as to alluvions) declares,\r\n§. 538. in opposition to the Roman law, that\r\n\r\n     'Les fleuves et rivières navigable ou flottables, les rivages,\r\n     lais et relais de la mer, les ports, les havres, les rades,\r\n     &c. sont considérés comme le dépendances du domaine public.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     'Rivers and navigable or floatable streams, shores, increments\r\n     and decrements of the sea, ports, harbors, roads, &c. are\r\n     considered as dependances of the public domain.'\r\n\r\nSo that notwithstanding the 'persuasive and conclusive arguments\r\nof these first lawyers of the country,' Liv. 31. the French\r\nlaw as it stands at this day, and stood before, would have given\r\nthe batture to the public, being unquestionably the [94]rivage or\r\nshore of the river.[95]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 37*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 38*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 39*]\r\n\r\n*I will now proceed further and say, that had the batture\r\nbeen an alluvion, and to be decided by the Roman,\r\ninstead of the French law, the conversion of the plantation\r\nof Gravier into a *suburb, made it public property. And\r\nhere I rejoin with pleasure the standard of M. Thierry,\r\nand avail myself of his luminous discussion of this point.\r\nWere I fully to go into it, I could *but repeat his matter. I shall\r\ntherefore give but a summary view of it, and rest on his\r\nargument for its more detailed support.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Rural and Urban.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 40*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 41*]\r\n\r\nThe position laid down is that the Roman law gave alluvion only to the\r\nrural proprietor of the bank; urban possessions being considered as\r\nprædia limitata, limited possessions. The law which gives this right is\r\nexpressed in the Institutes in these words, 'quod per alluvionem _agro_\r\ntuo flumen adjecit, jure gentium tibi adquiritur.' Inst. 2. 1. 20. 'What\r\nthe river has added, _agro tuo_, becomes yours by the laws of nations.'\r\nAnd the Digest 41. 1. 7. 1. in almost the same words says, 'quod per\r\nalluvionem _agro_ nostro flumen adjecit, jure gentium nobis adquiritur.'\r\nIn both instances it is to the possessor _agri_ only that it is given. It\r\nbecomes material therefore to understand rigorously the import of the\r\nword _ager_, in the Roman laws; and it happens that its definition is given\r\ncritically by the same authority which uses it. 'Locus sine ædificio, in\r\nurbe _area_, *rure autem _ager_ appellatur idemque _ager_, cum ædificio,\r\n_fundus_ dicitur.' Dig. 50. 16. 211. 'Quæstio est, fundus a possessione,\r\nvel agro, vel prædio quid distet?' Ib. 115 _in notis_, 'fundus est ipsum\r\nsolum: eo si utimur, prædium dicitur. _Ager_ esse potest sine villâ.'\r\n'Ground, without a building, in a city is called _area_, but in the\r\ncountry _ager_.' Pliny 1. 6. affirms that _ager_ is derived from the Greek\r\nἀγρὸς of the same import. And in the Greek Pragmatics of Attaliata tit.\r\n45. the law of alluvion uses 'ἀγρὸς' for _ager_. 'Τὸ ἀνεπαισθήτως διὰ\r\nτοῦ ποταμοῦ προστεθὲν τῷ ἀγρῷ μου πρόσχωσις ἐστὶν, ἤτοι πρόσκλυσις, καὶ\r\nἐμοὶ ἁρμόζει.' 'Quod insensibiliter τῷ ἀγρῷ μου per flumen adjectum est,\r\nalluvionis est, et mihi competit. 'What is insensibly added by the river\r\n_agro meo_ is alluvion [_adundatio, adaggeratio_] and belongs to me.' In\r\nthe same title 'ὅπερ ἐν τῷ ἀγρῷ σοῦ σπείρω σόν ἐστιν.' 'What I sow ἀγρῷ\r\nσου agro tuo, in your _field_, is yours.' And Stephens, in his Thesaur.\r\nling. Gr. voce 'Ἀγρὸς' translates it 'rus, ager,' 'ἐν ἀγρῷ' in agro,\r\nruri. Ἐξ ἀγρου, ex agro, rure. 'Εἰς ἀγρον, in agrum, rus.' And he cites\r\nexamples: 'Νηῦς δέ μοι ἥδ' ἕστηκεν ἐπ' ἀγροῦ, νόσφι πόληος'. Hom. Od. 1.\r\n185. 'My vessel is stationed in the _country_, apart from the city.' 'Διὰ\r\nτὸ μὴ μεγάλας εἶναι τότε τὰς ΠΟΛΕΙΣ, ἀλλ' ἐπὶ τῶν ΑΓΡΩΝ οἰκεῖν τὸν δῆμον\r\nἄσχολον ὄντα.' Aristo. Polit. 5. 'Because, the _cities_ not being then\r\nlarge, the people were occupied in the _country_, where ἀγρὸς is proved\r\nto be pointedly the contradiction to πόλις, to wit, the _country_ to\r\nthe _city_. From these definitions it appears that the word ager, in the\r\nlaw, constantly means a field, or farm, in the country, and that a city\r\nlot is called _area_. In towns, the whole bank and beach being necessary\r\nfor public use, the private right of alluvion would be inadmissible;\r\nand the adverse counsel have been challenged [Thierry, 33.] to produce\r\na single instance, under the Roman law, of a claim of Alluvion allowed\r\nin a city. To this might be added a similar challenge as to the laws of\r\nEngland. These give alluvion on rivers, as the civil law does, to the\r\nriparian proprietor. Bracton L. 2. c. 2. § 1. Fleta. L. 3. c. 2. Can\r\nthey from the volumes of English law, with which they are so much more\r\nfamiliar, produce one single instance of the private right of alluvion\r\nallowed in a city? In England, I mean, and not in America, where special\r\ncircumstances have prevented attention to the law on this subject, or\r\nthe breach of it. And this must be from the reason of the thing alone,\r\nbecause the common law never having been, like the civil law, reduced\r\nto a text, no verbal criticisms on a text can have co-operated against\r\nthe claim.[96] Repeating, *therefore, my reference to the reasoning and\r\nauthorities of M. Thierry on this point, and my own conviction of their\r\nsoundness, I consider it as established that, were this question to be\r\ndecided by the Roman law, the conversion of the farm into a fauxbourg\r\nof the city passed to the public all the riparian rights attached to it\r\nwhile a rural possession, and among these the right of alluvion.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Principal and accessory]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 42*]\r\n\r\nAnd, if the right of alluvion is not given to urban proprietors,\r\nmuch less would it to a mere holder of the bed of a\r\nroad. But did any one ever hear of a *man's holding\r\nthe bed of a road, and nothing else? Is it possible\r\nto believe that Bertrand Gravier, in selling his\r\nlots _face au fleuve_, really meant to retain the bed of\r\nthe road and levee? That a man, having a road on the margin\r\nof his land, which is its boundary, should mean to sell his land\r\nto the road, and to retain that by itself? a thing of no possible\r\n_use_ to him, because the _use_ being in the public, he could never\r\nemploy it in agriculture or otherwise. Were all this possible,\r\nyet this bed of a road, this \"labrum amnis\" would be no _ager_,\r\nno field to which the right of alluvion could attach. That right\r\nis but an accessory, or, in the language of our law, an appendage\r\nor appurtenance, and an accessory, not to a mere line, but to\r\nsomething of which it can become a part. Had the law, therefore,\r\never given alluvion to any but the holder of an _ager_, of a\r\nfield, yet the general doctrines of principal and accessory, would\r\nnot have carried the benefit to Bertrand Gravier in this case.\r\n'Accessorium sequitur naturam sui principalis. Et in accessoriis,\r\npræstanda sunt quæ in principali. Accessorium non tenet sine\r\nprincipali. Sublato principali, tollitur et accessorium.' These\r\nare maxims of the civil law. Calvini lexicon jurid. 'An accessory\r\nfollows the nature of its principal.' If the accession then\r\nbe to a field, it becomes part of the field; if to a town, it would\r\nbecome part of the town; if to a road, the use of which belongs\r\nto the public, it would be to the road, and to the public. It\r\nmust follow the nature of its principal, and become a part of that,\r\nsubject to the same rights, uses and servitudes with that: and\r\nBertrand Gravier had no right of use in the principal, that is, of\r\nthe road and levee.\r\n\r\nThe equity on which the right of alluvion is founded is, that\r\nas the owner of the field is exposed to the danger of loss, he\r\nought, as an equivalent, to have the chance of gain. But what\r\nequitable reason could there be, in the present case, for giving\r\nto Gravier the benefit of alluvion, when he could lose nothing\r\nby alluvion? If the levee and bank were washed away, they\r\nwould not go to his plantation, back of the suburb, for a new\r\none. The public would have to purchase a new bed for a road\r\nfrom the adjacent lot holders. Then 'qui sentit onus, sentire\r\ndebet et commodum.'\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Beach or Batture not Alluvion.]\r\n\r\nBut I do deny to the Batture every characteristic\r\nof Alluvion.\r\n\r\nThe French and Roman law constituting that of\r\nthe place, let us seek from them the definition of Alluvion. The\r\nInstitute 2. 1. 20. gives it in these words, and the Digest. 41. 1.\r\n7. §. 1. in almost verbatim the same.\r\n\r\n     'Quod per alluvionem agro tuo flumen adjecit, jure gentium\r\n     tibi adquiritur. Est autem alluvio incrementum latens. Per\r\n     alluvionem autem id videtur adjici, quod ita paulatim adjicitur,\r\n     ut intelligi non possit quantum quoquo temporis momento\r\n     adjiciatur.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     'What the river adds by alluvion to your field becomes yours by\r\n     the law of nature. Alluvion is a latent increase. That seems\r\n     to be added by alluvion, which is so added by degrees, that\r\n     you cannot conceive how much in each moment of time is added.'\r\n\r\nAnd in the Greek version of Theophilus, the words, 'Alluvio\r\nest incrementum latens' are rendered 'ἀλουβιων ἐστιν ἠ πρόσκλυσις ἢ\r\nπρόσχωσις,' translated by Curtius 'Alluvio est adundatio vel adaggeratio.'\r\nRetaining only the words of this paragraph which\r\nare definition it will stand thus.\r\n\r\n     'Alluvio est incrementum [_adundatio_, _adaggeratio_] agro\r\n     tuo flumine adjectum, ita latens et paulatim, ut intelligi\r\n     non possit quantum quoquo temporis momento adjiciatur.'\r\n\r\n     'Alluvion is an increment [_adundation_, _ad-aggeration_]\r\n     added by the river to your field, so latent and gradual, that\r\n     the quantity added in every moment of time cannot be known.'\r\n\r\nThis is the Roman definition.\r\n\r\nIn the Law Dictionary of the Encyclop. Method, _voce_ 'Alluvion'\r\nby Le Rasle, the definition is:\r\n\r\n     'Alluvion, un accroissement de terrein qui se fait peu-a-peu\r\n     sur les bords de la mer, des fleuves, et des rivières, par\r\n     les terres que l'eau y apporte, et qui se consolident pour ne\r\n     faire qu'un tout avec la terre voisine.'\r\n\r\n     'Alluvion, an increment of ground which is made by little and\r\n     little on the border of the sea, rivers or streams, by earth\r\n     which the water brings, and which is consolidated so as to\r\n     make but one whole with the neighboring ground.'\r\n\r\nTo reduce the essential members of the Roman and French\r\ndefinitions to a single one, according with our own common\r\nsense, for certainly we all understand what alluvion is, I should\r\nconsider the following definition as comprehending the essential\r\ncharacteristics of both.\r\n\r\n     1. 'Alluvion is an extension which the waters add insensibly.\r\n\r\n     2. By apposition of particles of earth.\r\n\r\n     3. Against the adjacent field.\r\n\r\n     4. And consolidate with it so as to make a part of it.\r\n\r\n     'Incrementum flumine adjectum latens et paulatim.\r\n\r\n               { πρόσχωσις, adaggeratio.\r\n               { πρόσκλυσις, adundatio.\r\n\r\n     _Agro_.\r\n\r\n     Qui se consolide pour ne faire qu'un tout avec la terre\r\n     voisine.'\r\n\r\nI take this to be rigorously conformable with the French and\r\nRoman definitions, as cited from the authorities before mentioned,\r\nand that it contains not one word which is not within\r\ntheir unquestionable meaning. Now let us try the batture by\r\nthis test.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 44*]\r\n\r\n1. 'Alluvion is an extension which the waters add insensibly.'\r\nBut the increment of the batture has by no means been\r\n_insensible_. Every swell of six months is said [Derb xix.] to deposit\r\nusually nearly a foot of mud on the whole surface\r\nof the batture, so that, *when the waters retire, the increment\r\nis visible to every eye. And we have seen that,\r\naided by Mr. Livingston's works, a single tide extended the batture\r\nfrom 75 to 80 feet further into the river, and deposited on it\r\nfrom 2 to 7 feet of mud, insomuch that a saw-scaffold, 7 feet\r\nhigh when the waters rose on it, was, on their retiring, buried\r\nto its top. This increment is, surely, not insensible. See the\r\nMayor's answer to the Governor, Nov. 18, '08. MS.\r\n\r\n2. 'By _apposition_ of particles of earth,' or, by their _adhesion_.\r\nBut the addition to the batture is by _deposition_ of particles of\r\nearth on its face, not by their _apposition_ or _adhesion_ to the bank.\r\nIt is not pretended that the bank has extended by apposition of\r\nparticles to its side, one inch towards the river. It remains now\r\nthe same as when the levée was erected on it. The deposition\r\nof earth on the bottom of a river, can be no more said to be an\r\napposition to its sides, than the coating the floor of a room can\r\nbe said to be plastering its walls.\r\n\r\n3. 'Against the adjacent field,' la terre voisine. Not a particle\r\nhas been added to the adjacent field. That remains as it\r\nwas, bounded by the identical line, _crepido_, or _ora terræ_, which\r\nhas ever bounded it.\r\n\r\n4. 'And consolidated with the field so as to make part of it.'\r\nUn tout avec la terre voisine. Even supposing the continuity\r\nof the adjacent field not to be broken by the intervention of the\r\nlevée and road, nothing is consolidated with it, not even with the\r\n_margo riparum_, or chemin de hallage, if there be any, between\r\nthe levée and brim of the bank. No extension of its surface has\r\ntaken place so as to form one with the former surface, so as to\r\nbe a continuation of that surface, so as to be arable like that.\r\nThe highest part of the batture, even where it abuts against the\r\nbank, is still materially below the level of the adjacent field.\r\nA terrass of some feet height still separates the field from the\r\ndeposition called the batture. It is now as distinguishable from\r\nthe adjacent field as it ever was, being covered with water\r\nperiodically 6 months in the year, while that is dry. Alluvion\r\nis identified with the farmer's field, because of identity of character,\r\nfitness for the same use: but the batture is not fitted for\r\nploughing or sowing. It is clear then that the batture has not\r\na single feature of Alluvion; and divesting it of this misnomer,\r\nthe whole claim of the plaintiff falls to the ground: for he has\r\nnot pretended that it could be his under any other title than that\r\nof Alluvion.\r\n\r\nWe will now proceed to shew what it is, which will further\r\ndemonstrate what it is not.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Bed, Beach, Bank.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 45*]\r\n\r\nIn the channel, or hollow, containing a river, the Roman law\r\nhas distinguished the _alveus_, or bed of the river, and\r\nthe _ripa_, or bank, the river itself being _aqua_, water.\r\n'Tribus constant flumina, alveo, aqua, et ripis'. Dig.\r\n43. 12. *not. 1. All above high water mark they\r\nconsidered as _ripa_, bank, and all below as _alveus_, or\r\nbed. The same terms have the same extent in the language of\r\nour law likewise. But we distinguish, by an additional name,\r\nthat band, or margin of the bed of the river, which lies between\r\nthe high and the low water marks. We call it the _beach_. Other\r\nmodern nations distinguish it also. In Spanish it is _playa_, Ital.\r\n_piaggia_, in French _plage_, in the local terms of Orleans it is _batture_,\r\nand sometimes _platin_.[97] In Latin I know of no terms which\r\napplies exactly to _the beach of a river_. _Litus_ is restrained to\r\n_the shore of the sea_, and there comprehends the beach, going to\r\nthe water edge, whether at high or low tide. '_Litus_ est maris,\r\n_ripa_ fluminis,' says Vinnius in his Commentary on the Inst. 2.\r\n1. 4. and he confirms this difference of extent towards the water,\r\nibid. where he says,\r\n\r\n     'Neque verò idem est _ripa in flumine_, quod _litus in mari_.\r\n     Ripa flumini non subjicitur, ut litora subjiciuntur mari, et\r\n     quotidianis accessibus ab eo occupantur.'\r\n\r\n     'Nor is the bank of a river, and the shore of the sea, the same\r\n     thing. The bank is not subjacent to the river as the shores\r\n     are to the sea, which are occupied by it in its daily accesses.'\r\n\r\nIn our rivers, as far as the tide flows, the beach is the actual,\r\nas well as the nominal bed of the river, during the half of every\r\nday. Above the flow of tide, it is covered half the year at a\r\ntime, instead of half of every day. The tide there being annual\r\nonly, or one regular tide in a year. This, in the State where I\r\nam, begins about the first of November, is at its full tide during\r\nthe months of January and February, and retires to its minimum\r\nby the end of April. In other States from North to South, this\r\nprogression may vary a little. Hence we call them the Summer\r\nand Winter tides, as the Romans did theirs, _hibernus et æstivus_.\r\nThe Mississippi resembles our fresh water rivers in having only\r\none regular swell or tide a year. It differs from them in not\r\nbeing subject to occasional swells. The regions it waters are so\r\nvast that accidental rains and droughts in one part are countervailed\r\nby contrary accidents in other parts, so as never\r\nto become *sensible in the river. It is only when all the\r\ncountries it occupies become subject to the general influence\r\nof summer or winter, that a regular and steady flood or ebb\r\ntakes place. It differs too in the seasons of its tides, which are\r\nabout three months later than in our rivers. Its swell begins\r\nwith February, is at its greatest height in May, June, and July,\r\nand the waters retire by the end of August. Its high tide, therefore,\r\nis in summer, and the low water in winter. Being regular\r\nin its tides, it is regular also in the period of its inundations.\r\nWhereas in ours, although the natural banks rarely escape being\r\noverflowed at some time of the season, yet the precise time varies\r\nwith the accident of the fall of rains. But it is not the name of\r\nthe season but the fact of the rise and fall which determine the\r\nlaw of the case.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 46*]\r\n\r\nNow the batture St. Mary is precisely within this band, or margin,\r\nbetween the high and low water mark of the Missisipi called\r\nthe beach. It extended from the bank into the river from 122\r\nto 247 yards, before Mr. Livingston began his works, and these\r\nhave added in one year, from 75 to 80 feet to its breadth. This\r\nriver abounds with similar beaches, but this one alone, from its\r\nposition and importance to the city, has called for a legal investigation\r\nof its character. Every country furnishes examples of\r\nthis kind, great or small; but the most extensive are in Northern\r\nclimates. The beach of the Forth, for example, adjacent to\r\nEdinburgh, is a mile wide, and is covered by every tide with 20\r\nfeet water. Abundance of examples of more extensive beaches\r\nmight be produced; many doubtless from New-Hampshire and\r\nMaine, where the tide rises 40 feet. This therefore of St. Mary\r\nis not extraordinary but for the cupidity which its importance to\r\nthe city of New-Orleans has inspired.\r\n\r\nI shall proceed to state the authorities on which this division\r\nbetween the bank and bed of the river is established, and which\r\nmakes the margin or beach a part of the bed of the river.\r\n\r\n     'Ripa est pars extima alvei, quò naturaliter flumen excurrit.'\r\n     Grotius de Jour. B. et P. 2. 8. 9.\r\n\r\n     'Ripa ea putatur esse quæ _plenissimum_ flumen continet.' Dig.\r\n     43. 12. 3. And Vinnius's commentary on this passage is 'ut\r\n     significet, partem ripæ non esse, spatium illud, ripæ proximum,\r\n     quod aliquando flumine, caloribus minuto æstivo tempore non\r\n     occupatur.'\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 47*]\r\n\r\n     'Ripa autem ita rectè definietur, id quod flumen continet\r\n     naturalem* rigorem[98] cursus sui tenons.

Nemo denique dixit Nilum, qui incremento\r\n     suo Ægyptum operit, ripas suas mutare, vel ampliare. Nam cum\r\n     ad perpetuam sui mensuram redierit, ripæ alvei ejus muniendæ\r\n     sunt.'

But, if at\r\n     any time, either from rains, the sea, or any other cause, it\r\n     has overflowed a time, it does not change its banks. Nobody\r\n     has said that the Nile, which by its increase covers Egypt,\r\n     changes or enlarges its banks. For when it has returned to\r\n     its usual height, the banks of its bed are to be secured.'\r\n\r\n     'The bed is covered by the river.'\r\n\r\n     'The bed is the space, subjacent to the river, through which\r\n     it flows.'\r\n\r\nLittus, in the Roman law, being the beach or shore of the sea,\r\n'rivage,' definitions of that will corroborate the division between\r\nthe _ripa_ and _alveus_, _bed_ and _bank_ of a river. In both cases\r\nwhat is covered by the highest tide belongs to the public, all\r\nabove it is private property.\r\n\r\n     'Litus est quousque maximus fluctus à mari pervenit.

B. 2. c. 1.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 48*]\r\n\r\nWe must not, however, with Mr. Livingston, pa. 61. seize on\r\nthe single word 'hibernus,' in the last quotations, and\r\nsacrifice *to that both the fact, and the reason of the law.\r\nThe substance of the _fact_ on which the law goes, is that\r\nthere is a margin of the bed of the river, covered at high water,\r\nuncovered at low. The season when this happens is a matter\r\nof circumstance only, and of immaterial circumstance. In the\r\nrivers familiar to the Romans the _maximus fluctus_, or highest\r\nwave, was in the winter; in the Missisipi it is in summer. Circumstance\r\nmust always yield to substance. The _object_ of the\r\nlaw is to reserve that margin to the public. But to reduce, with\r\nMr. Livingston, the public right to the Summer water-line would\r\nrelinquish that object. The explanations quoted from Vinnius,\r\nfrom Theophilus and his Scholiast, prove from the reason of the\r\nlaw, that the law of the winter tide for the Po, and the Tyber,\r\nmust be that of the Summer tide of the Missisipi. The Spanish\r\nlaw therefore, is expressed in more correct terms; and we have\r\nthe authority of Mr. Livingston [ibidem] for saying that the Justinian\r\ncode is the common law of Spain.\r\n\r\n     'La ribera del rio se entiende todo lo que cubre el agua de\r\n     el, quando mas crece, en qualquiera tiempo del año, sin salir\r\n     de su yema y madre.' Curia Philipica. 2. 3. 1. cited Derb. 46.\r\n\r\n     'The bank of a river is understood to be the whole of what\r\n     contains its waters, when most swelled, in whatsoever time of\r\n     the year, without leaving its bed or channel.'\r\n\r\nThis is the law correctly for all rivers, leaving to every one its\r\nown season of flood or ebb.\r\n\r\nTo these authorities from the Roman and Spanish law, I will\r\nadd that of the French Ordinance of 1681. § 43. Art. 1. on the\r\nsame subject.\r\n\r\n     'Sera réputé bord et rivage de la mer, tout ce qu'elle couvre\r\n     et découvre [precisely the beach or batture] pendant les\r\n     nouvelles et pleines lunes, et jusqu'où le grand flot de mer\r\n     cesse de s'y faire sentir.

It is easy\r\n     to know how far ordinarily the full tide of March extends;\r\n     by the gravel which is deposited there; therefore we must not\r\n     confound that part with the space where the waters of the sea\r\n     come sometimes in hurricanes and storms.' So adjudged at Aix,\r\n     May 11, 1742.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 49*]\r\n\r\nLet us now embody those authorities, by bringing together\r\nthe separate members, making them paraphrase one another,\r\nand form a *single description. The Digest 43. 12.\r\n3. with Vinnius's comment will stand thus. 'The bank\r\nends at the line to which the water rises at its full tide; and although\r\nthe space next below it is sometimes uncovered by the\r\nriver, when reduced by heats in the Summer season, yet that\r\nspace is not a part of the bank.' Now, substituting for 'the heats\r\nof the summer season' which is circumstance, and immaterial,\r\nthe term 'low water,' which is the substance of the case, nothing\r\ncan more perfectly describe the beach or batture, nor collated\r\nwith the other authorities, make a more consistent and rational\r\nprovision. 'The bank ends at that line on the levée to which\r\nthe river rises at its full tide: and altho' the batture or beach\r\nnext below that line is uncovered by the river, when reduced to\r\nits low tide, yet that batture or beach does not therefore become\r\na part of the bank, but remains a part of the bed of the river,'\r\nfor says Theophilus 'even in low water [et æstate] we bound\r\nthe bank at the line of high water.' Inst. 2. 1. 3. 'The bank\r\nbeing the _extima alvei_, the _border of the bed_, within which bed\r\nthe river flows when in its fullest state _naturally_, that is to say,\r\nnot when 'imbribus, vel quâ aliâ ratione, ad tempus, excrevit,'\r\nnot when 'temporarily overflowed by extraordinary rains, &c.'\r\nDig. 43. 12. 5. but 'quando mas crece, sin salir de su madre, en\r\nqualquiera tiempo del año,' 'when in its full height, without\r\nleaving its bed, to whatsoever season of the year the period\r\nof full height may belong.' This is unquestionably the meaning\r\nof all the authorities taken together, and explaining one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nFrom these authorities, then, the conclusion is most rigorously\r\nexact, that all is river, or river's _bed_, which is contained between\r\nthe two banks, and the high water line on them; and all is _bank_\r\nwhich embraces the waters in their ordinary full tide.\r\n\r\nAgreeably to this has been the constant practice and extent\r\nof grants of lands on the Missisipi. Charles Trudeau swears\r\n[Liv. 57.] that 'during 28 years that he has performed the functions\r\nof Surveyor General of this province, it has always been in\r\nhis _knowledge_, that the grants of lands on the borders of the\r\nMissisipi, have their fronts on the _edge_ of the river itself, and\r\nwhen its waters are _at their greatest height_.' And Laveau\r\nTrudeau [Liv. 58.] that 'the concession to the Jesuits, he believes,\r\nwas like all the others, that is, from the river at its greatest\r\nheight.'\r\n\r\nThus we see what the law is; that it has been perfectly understood\r\nin the territory, and has been constantly practiced on,\r\nand consequently that neither the grant to the Jesuits, nor to\r\nBertrand Gravier, could have included the beach or batture.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Missisipi.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 50*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Nile.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 51*]\r\n\r\nIt will perhaps be objected that, establishing the commencement\r\nof the bank at high water mark, leaves in fact\r\nno bank at all, as the high water regularly overflows\r\nthe natural* bank or brim of the channel. And will\r\nit be a new phenomenon to see a river without banks\r\nsufficient to contain its waters at their full tide? The Missisipi\r\nis certainly a river of a character marked by strong features. It\r\nwill be very practicable, by exaggerating these, to draw a line\r\nof separation between this and the mass of the rivers of our\r\ncountry, to consider it as _sui generis_, not subject to the laws\r\nwhich govern other rivers, but needing a system of law for itself.\r\nAnd until this system can be prepared it may be abandoned to\r\nspeculations of death and devastation like the present. But will\r\nthis be the object of the sound judge or legislator? it is certainly\r\nfor the good of the whole nation to assimilate as much as possible\r\nall its parts, to strengthen their analogies, obliterate the traits\r\nof difference, and to deal law and justice to all by the same rule\r\nand same measure. The _bayous_ of all that territory and of the\r\ncountry thence to Florida Point are without banks to contain\r\ntheir full tides. The Missisipi is in the like state as far as Bâton\r\nRouge, where competent banks first rise out of the waters, and\r\ncontinue with intervals of depression to its upper parts. Many\r\nof the rivers of our maritime states are under circumstances resembling\r\nthese. The channel which nature has hallowed for\r\nthem is not yet deep enough, or the depositions of earth on the\r\nadjacent grounds not yet sufficiently accumulated, to raise them\r\nentirely clear of the flood tides. Extensive bodies of lands, still\r\nmarshy therefore, are covered by them at every tide. In some\r\nof these cases, the hand of man, regulated by laws which restrain\r\nobstructions to navigation and injury to others, has aided and\r\nexpedited the operations of nature, by raising the bank which\r\nshe had begun, and redeeming the lands from the dominion of\r\nthe waters. The same thing has been done on the Missisipi.\r\nAn artificial bank of 3, 4, or 5 feet has been raised on the natural\r\none, has made that sufficient to contain its full waters, and\r\nto protect a fertile and extensive country from its ravages. These\r\nare become the real banks of the river, on which the\r\nlaws operate as if the whole was natural. The Nile,\r\nlike the Missisipi, has natural banks, not competent in every part\r\nto the conveyance of its waters. In these parts artificial banks\r\nare, in like manner, raised, through which and the natural bayous\r\nand artificial canals the inundation, when at a given[99] height, is\r\nadmitted; this being indispensable to fertilize the lands in a\r\ncountry where it never rains. And these banks of the Nile, natural\r\nand artificial, are recognized as such by the Roman\r\nlaw, as appears in *a passage of the Digest before cited,\r\ndeclaring that its banks, tho' inundated periodically, are\r\nnot thereby changed. Nor are those of our rivers when temporarily\r\noverflowed by rains, or other causes. Wherever therefore\r\nthe banks of the Missisipi have no high water line, the\r\nobjection is of no consequence, because the lands there are not\r\nas yet reclaimed or inhabited; and wherever they are reclaimed,\r\nthe objection is not true; for there a high water line exists to\r\nseparate the private from public right.[100]\r\n\r\n1. The Upper Missisipi, like the Upper Nile, has competent natural banks\r\nthrough probably three fourths of its whole course. There then the Roman\r\nlaw is applicable in its very letter. 2. For about 400 miles more, the\r\nnatural banks have been aided by artificial ones, on both sides, so as\r\nto contain all the waters of the flumen plenissimum: and the inhabitants\r\nthere have no occasion as those of the Nile, to open their banks for the\r\npurpose either of fertilizing, or irrigating the lands. Here then there\r\nis still less reason, than in the case of the Nile, to say that 'the\r\nMissisipi has changed its bank.' 3. On the lower parts of the Missisipi\r\nand some of its middle portion, especially on the Western side, artificial\r\nbanks have not yet been made, and the country is regularly inundated,\r\nas it is on those parts of our Atlantic rivers not yet embanked. But\r\nour increasing population will continue to extend these banks of our\r\nAtlantic rivers; and, for this purpose, our governments grant the lands\r\nto individuals. And the same, we know, is done on the Missisipi. The\r\n_Cypriores_ adjacent to New-Orleans, for example, though covered with the\r\nrefluent water from the lake, we know have been granted to individuals,\r\nand will, with the rest of the drowned lands, be reclaimed in time, as\r\nall lower Egypt has been.\r\n\r\nThus then we find the laws of the Tyber and Nile transferred and applied\r\nto the Missisipi with perfect accordance, and that all rivers may be\r\ngoverned by the same laws. Other rivers are subject to accidental floods,\r\nwhich are declared however not to disturb the law of the _plenissimum\r\nflumen_. The Nile and Missisipi, not being subject to accidental floods,\r\nthe _flumen plenissimum_ with them is steady and undisturbed, and needs not\r\nthe benefit of the exception. Nor will the reason of the law be changed,\r\nwhether the cause of the inundation be the saturation of the earth and\r\nfountains, or rains, or melted snows, or the reflux of the ocean. The\r\nprinciple remains universally the same, that the land mark, when once\r\nestablished by a competent bank, is not changed by the inundation, or\r\nby any cause or circumstance of its high waters.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 52*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Property in bed and bank.]\r\n\r\n*Having ascertained what the batture is not, and what it is,\r\nand established the high water mark as the line of\r\npartition between the bed and bank of the river, we\r\nwill proceed to examine to whom belongs ground on\r\neither side of that line?\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 53*]\r\n\r\nAnd 1. As to the bed of the river, there can be no question\r\nbut that it belongs purely and simply to the sovereign, as the\r\nrepresentative and trustee of the nation. If a navigable river\r\nindeed deserts its bed, the Roman law gave it to the adjacent\r\nproprietors;* the former law of France to the\r\nsovereign; and the new Code gives it as an indemnity to those\r\nthrough whose lands the new course is opened. But, while it is\r\noccupied by the river, all laws, I believe, agree in giving it\r\nto the sovereign; not as his personal property, to become an object\r\nof revenue, or of alienation, but to be kept open for the free\r\nuse of all the individuals of the nation.\r\n\r\n     'Flumina omnia, et portus, publica sunt.' Inst. 2. 1. 2.\r\n\r\n     'Impossibile est ut alveus fluminis publici non sit publicus.'\r\n     Dig. 43. 12. 7.\r\n\r\n     'Litus publicum est eatenùs qua maximus fluctus exæstuat.'\r\n     Dig. 50. 16. 96. 112.\r\n\r\n     'All rivers and ports are public.'\r\n\r\n     'It is impossible that the bed of a public river should not\r\n     be public.'\r\n\r\n     'The seashore is public as far as the greatest wave surges.'\r\n\r\nAnd 'littus' we have seen is the beach or shore of the sea.\r\n\r\n'As to navigable streams and rivers, on which boats can ply,\r\nthe property of them is in the king, as an incontestable right,\r\nnaturally attached to the sovereignty; and since public things\r\nbelonged to the people in the Roman republic, amongst us [in\r\nFrance] they must belong to our Sovereigns.' Julien, cited by\r\nThierry 10. And Prevost de la Jannès, in his Principles of\r\nFrench Jurisprudence, after having said that the property of public\r\nthings belongs to the king adds 'subject to the use thereof\r\nthat is due to the people.' Thierry, ib.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, by the Common law of England, the property,\r\n_tam aquæ quam soli_, of every river, having flux or reflux, or\r\nsusceptible of any navigation, is in the king; who cannot grant\r\nit to a subject, because it is a highway, except for purposes which\r\nwill increase the convenience of navigation. 'The king has a\r\nright of property to the sea shore, and the _maritima incrementa_.\r\nThe _shore_ is the land lying between high water and low water\r\nmark in ordinary tides, and this land belongeth to the king\r\n_de jure communi_, both in the shore of the sea, and shore of\r\nthe arms of the sea. And that is called an arm of the sea\r\nwhere the tide flows and reflows, and so far only as the tide\r\nflows and reflows.' Hale de jure maris. c. 4. cited in Bac. Abr.\r\nPrærog. B. 3.\r\n\r\nSo that I presume no question is to be made but that the bed\r\nof the Missisipi belongs to the sovereign, that is, to the Nation.\r\n\r\n2. In the bank, from the high water line inland, it is admitted\r\nthat the property or ownership, is in the Riparian proprietor of\r\nthe adjacent field or farm: but the use is in the public, for the\r\npurposes of navigation and other necessary uses.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 54*]\r\n\r\n     'Riparum quoque usus publicus est jure gentium [i. e. gentis\r\n     humanæ] sicut ipsius fluminis: itaque naves ad eas appellere,\r\n     funes arboribus ibi natis religare, onus aliquod in his\r\n     reponere, cuilibet liberum est, sicut per ipsum flumen navigare.\r\n     Sed proprietas earum, illorum est, quorum prædiis hærent: quâ\r\n     de causâ arbores quoque in eisdem natæ corundem sunt.'

L. 1. c. 17.\r\n\r\n     'The use of the bank is public by the law of nations [i. e.\r\n     of nature] as to navigate the river itself. Therefore it is\r\n     free for every *one to bring his ships to at them, to make\r\n     fast ropes to the trees growing there, to discharge any load\r\n     on them. But the property of them is in those to whose farms\r\n     they adhere; for which reason the trees likewise growing on\r\n     them, belong to the same.' And Vinnius adds 'the banks do not,\r\n     like the shores of the sea, follow the condition of the river.'\r\n\r\n     'Rivers, harbors, the beds of rivers as long as occupied by\r\n     the river, and the banks are public. The property of all these\r\n     is in no one, if you will except the banks, the property of\r\n     which is in those who possess the farms on the bank.'\r\n\r\n'Rivers, streams, high roads belong to all men in common;\r\nand although the soil of the banks of the rivers be an accession\r\nto the property of the owners of the contiguous land, yet all men\r\nmay make use of them so far as to make fast their vessels to the\r\ntrees which grow there, to repair them, and spread their sails on\r\nthe banks; and they may there discharge their goods. Fishermen\r\nhave also a right to dry their nets there, to expose their fish\r\nfor sale on the banks, and in general to use them for every purpose\r\nof their art, or the occupation by which they live.' 3 Part\r\nid. 28. 6. cited Thierry 9.\r\n\r\n'The same usefulness of the navigation of rivers demands the\r\nfree use of their banks, so that in the breadth and length necessary\r\nfor the passage and track of the horses which draw the boats,\r\nthere be neither tree planted nor any other obstacle in the way.'\r\nDomat, Pub. law. 1. 8. 2. 9.

And if the neighbors experience any other evil\r\n     from the act of him who is convened, there will be ground for\r\n     interdict.'\r\n\r\n     'Sunt qui putent excipiendum hoc interdicto \"quod ejus ripæ\r\n     muniendæ causa non flet,\" seilicet ut si quid fiat quo aliter\r\n     aqua fluat, si tamen muniendæ ripæ causâ fiat, interdicto\r\n     locus non sit. Sed ne hoc quibusdam placet; neque enim ripæ,\r\n     cum incommodo accolentium, muniendæ sunt.' Ib. §. 6.\r\n\r\n     'Some think liable to this interdict only \"what is not done\r\n     for the purpose of strengthening the bank,\" to wit, that if\r\n     any thing be done by which the water may otherwise flow, if\r\n     nevertheless it was to secure the bank, there is no ground for\r\n     interdict. But this is not approved by others, for that banks\r\n     are not to be secured to the inconvenience of the inhabitants.'\r\n\r\nMore particularly full and explicit as to the inhibitions of the\r\nlaw against obstructing the bed, beach or bank of a sea or river,\r\nis Noodt, Probabil. Juris civilis. 4. 1. 1. After declaring that as\r\nto a house, or other such thing, built in a public river, the law is\r\nthe same as obtains as to the sea and sea shore, he proposes to\r\nstate, 1. The law respecting the sea and its shore, and 2. As it\r\nrespects a river and its bank; and says,\r\n\r\n     'Ait Celsus maris communem usum esse, ut aëris; jactasque in\r\n     id pilas fieri ejus qui jecit: sed id concedendum non esse,\r\n     si deterior litoris marisve usus eo modo futurus sit. Adeo hoc\r\n     quod in mari exstructum est, facientis est. Ut tamen exstruere\r\n     liceat, et _decreto opus est_, et _ut innoxia ædificatio\r\n     sit_. Porrò ut usus maris, ita usus litoris, sive communis,\r\n     sive publicus est jure gentium; et ideò licet unicuique\r\n     in litore ædificare, litusque ædificatione suum facere. Si\r\n     tamen, ut in mari, ita in litore, _impetravit_: præterea si\r\n     non eo modo deterior futurus sit usus litoris; vel nisi usus\r\n     publicus _impedietur_. Hoc in mari litoribus jus est. Idem in\r\n     fluminibus publicis, Ulpiano teste, Dig. 39. 2. 24. cum sic\r\n     ait, 'fluminium publicorum communis est usus, sicut viarum\r\n     publicarum et litorum. In his igitur _publicè_ licet cuilibet\r\n     ædificare, et distruere, dum tamen hoc sine incommodo cujusquam\r\n     fiat.' Vult tamen Ulpianus, ut ædificari possit, ædificari\r\n     _publicè_ et _sine cujusquam incommodo_; pariter ut in mari et\r\n     litore definitum: _publicè_ inquam, seu _publicâ auctoritate_;\r\n     id enim hoc verbum, _publicè_ indigitat.' And (§. 2.) citing\r\n     Dig. 43. 12. 4. he says, 'quæsitum est, an is, qui in utrâque\r\n     ripâ fluminis publici domus habeat, pontem privati juris [vel\r\n     privato jure] facere potest; respondit non posse. Et si facit,\r\n     interdicto teneri. Causa responsi est quod, cum pontem facit,\r\n     usum fluminis publici facit deteriorem.' So far Noodt.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 57*]\r\n\r\n     'Celsus says that the use of the sea is common, as is that of\r\n     the air: and that stones laid in it were his who laid them,\r\n     but that it was not to be admitted if the use of the shore or\r\n     sea would be *the worse. So what is constructed in the sea is\r\n     his who constructs it. But to make it lawful to construct, a\r\n     decree is necessary, and that the construction be innocent.\r\n     Moreover, as the use of the sea, so that of the shore, is\r\n     either common or public, by the law of nations. And therefore\r\n     it is lawful for any one to build on the shore, and to make the\r\n     shore his by the building; if however, as in the sea, so on\r\n     the shore, he has obtained permission: and provided besides,\r\n     the use of the shore will not thereby be rendered worse, nor\r\n     the public use be impeded. This is the law as to the sea and\r\n     its shores. It is the same as to public rivers, according to\r\n     Ulpian, Dig. 39. 2. 24. where he says, 'the use of public rivers\r\n     is common, as of highways and shores. In these, therefore,\r\n     any one may build up, or pull down, _publicly_, provided it\r\n     be done without _inconvenience to any one_.' That you may\r\n     build, however, Ulpian requires that you build _publicly_,\r\n     and _without inconvenience_ to any one; in like manner as is\r\n     prescribed as to the sea, and its shore: _publicly_, I say, or\r\n     _by public authority_; for that is what the word _publicly_,\r\n     indicates. And §. 2. citing Dig. 43. 12. 4. he says, 'it is\r\n     asked whether he who has houses on both banks of the river,\r\n     may build a bridge, of his own private authority. He answers,\r\n     he cannot; and if he does, he is bound by the interdict. The\r\n     reason of the answer is, that by building a bridge he injures\r\n     the use of a public river.' So far Noodt.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 58*]\r\n\r\n* The same is the law as to highways and public places.\r\nDig. 43. 8. 2. 16.\r\n\r\n     'Si quis à principe simpliciter impetraverit ut in publico\r\n     loco ædificet, non est credendus sic ædificare ut cum incommodo\r\n     alicujus id fiat.'\r\n\r\n     'If any one obtains leave, simply, from the prince, to build\r\n     in a public place, it is not to be understood he is so to\r\n     build as to incommode another.'\r\n\r\nWe see then that the Roman law not only forbade every species\r\nof construction or work on the bed, beach or bank of a sea\r\nor river, without regular permission from the proper officer, but\r\neven annuls the permission after it is given, if, in event, the work\r\nproves injurious; not abandoning the lives and properties of its\r\ncitizens to the ignorance, the facility, or the corruption, of any\r\nofficer. Indeed, without all this appeal to such learned authorities,\r\ndoes not common sense, the foundation of all authorities, of the\r\nlaws themselves, and of their construction, declare it impossible\r\nthat Mr. Livingston, a single individual, should have a lawful\r\nright to drown the city of New-Orleans, or to injure, or change,\r\nof his own authority, the course or current of a river which is to\r\ngive outlet to the productions of two-thirds of the whole area of\r\nthe United States?\r\n\r\nSuch, then, are the laws of Louisiana, declaratory of the public\r\nrights in navigable rivers, their beds and banks. For we\r\nmust ever bear in mind that the Roman law, from which these\r\nextracts are made, so far as it is not controlled by the Customs\r\nof Paris, the Ordinances of France, or the Spanish regulations,\r\nis the law of Louisiana. Nor does this law deal in precept only,\r\nor trust the public rights to the dead letter of law merely: it\r\nprovides also for enforcement. The Digest. L. 43. tit. 15. de\r\nripâ muniendâ; provides\r\n\r\n     §. 1. 'Ripas fluminum publicorum reficere, munire, utilissimum\r\n     est,--_dùm ne ob id navigatio deterior fiat_: illa enim sola\r\n     refectio toleranda est, quæ navigationi non est impedimento.'\r\n\r\n     §. 1. 'To repair and strengthen the banks of public rivers,\r\n     is most useful: provided the navigation be not by that\r\n     deteriorated; for those repairs alone are to be permitted\r\n     which do not impede the navigation.'\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Surety.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 59*]\r\n\r\n     §. 3. 'Is autem qui ripam vult munire, de damno futuro debet\r\n     vel cavere, vel satisdare, secundum qualitatem personæ. Et hoc\r\n     interdicto expressum est, ut damni infecti, in annos decem,\r\n     viri boni arbitratu, vel caveatur, vel satisdetur.'\r\n\r\n     §. 3. But he who would strengthen his bank, should give either\r\n     an engagement, or security against future injury, according\r\n     to the quality of the person. And this *interdict establishes\r\n     that the engagement, or security, against future injury, shall\r\n     be for ten years, by the opinion of a good man.'\r\n\r\n     §. 4. 'Dabitur autem satis vicinis; sed et his qui trans flumen\r\n     possidebunt.\r\n\r\n     §. 4. 'Security shall be given to the neighbors, and also to\r\n     possessors on the other side of the river.'\r\n\r\n     'Ne quid in loco publico facias, inve cum locum immittas, quâ\r\n     ex re quid illi damni detur. Dig. 43. 8. 2. Ad ea loca hoc\r\n     interdictum pertinet, quæ publico usui destinata noceret, Prætor\r\n     intercederet interdicto suo. §. 5. Adversus eum qui molem in\r\n     mare projecit, interdictum utile competit ei, cui forte hæc\r\n     res nocitura sit: si autem nemo damnum sentit, tuendus est is,\r\n     qui in litore ædificat vel molem in mare jacit. §. 8.--Damnum\r\n     autem pati videtur, qui commodum amittit, quod ex publico\r\n     consequebatur, qualequale sit. §. 11.--Si tamen nullum opus\r\n     factum fuerit, officio judicis continetur, ut caveatur non\r\n     fieri.' §. 18.\r\n\r\n     'You are to do nothing in any public place, nor to cast any\r\n     thing into that place, from which any damage may follow. This\r\n     interdict respects those places, which are destined for public\r\n     use: and that if anything be there done, which may injure an\r\n     individual, the Prætor may interpose by his interdict.--Against\r\n     him who projects a mole into the sea, the _interdictum utile_\r\n     lies for him to whom this may possibly do injury, but if\r\n     nobody sustains damage, he is to be protected who builds on\r\n     the sea shore, or projects a mole into the sea.--And he seems\r\n     to suffer injury who loses any convenience, which he derived\r\n     from the public, whatsoever it may be.--But if no work is\r\n     done, he should be constrained by the authority of the judge\r\n     to engage that none shall be done.'\r\n\r\n'Seeing the use of rivers belongs to the public, nobody can\r\nmake any change in them that may be of prejudice to the said\r\nuse. Thus one cannot do any thing to make the current of the\r\nwater slower, or more rapid, should this change be any way prejudicial\r\nto the public, or to particular persons. Thus although\r\none may divert the water of a brook, or a river, to water his\r\nmeadows or other grounds, or for mills and other uses; yet,\r\nevery one ought to use this liberty so as not to do any prejudice,\r\neither to the navigation of the river, whose waters he should\r\nturn aside, or the navigation of another river which the said water\r\nshould render navigable by discharging itself into it, or to any\r\nother public use, or to neighbors who should have a like want,\r\nand an equal right.' Dom. Pub. law. 1. 8. 2. 11.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 60*]\r\n\r\n*The same laws make it peculiarly incumbent on the government\r\nand its officers to watch over the public property\r\nand rights, and to see that they are not injured or intruded\r\non by private individuals. In order to preserve the\r\nnavigation of rivers, it is proper for the government to prohibit\r\nand punish all attempts which might hinder it, or render it inconvenient,\r\nwhether it be any buildings, fisheries, stakes, floodgates\r\nand other hindrances, or by diverting the water from the\r\ncourse of the rivers, or otherwise. And it is likewise forbidden\r\nto throw into the rivers any filth, dirt or other things, which\r\nmight be of prejudice to the navigation, or cause other inconveniences.'\r\nDom. Pub. L. 1. 8. 2. 8.\r\n\r\n     'Quoique la mer et ses bords soient, suivant les principes du\r\n     droit naturel, des choses publiques et communes à tous, avec\r\n     faculté à chacun d'en user selon sa destination, neanmoins\r\n     il ne doit pas étre permis aux uns d'en jouir au préjudice\r\n     des autres. Ainsi pour prévenir les inconveniens qui seroient\r\n     résultés de la liberté d'user de la chose commune, il a fallu\r\n     que cette liberté fut limitée par la puissance publique, ainsi\r\n     que s'en explique Domat, &c. Nouv. Comment. sur l'orden. de\r\n     1681. tit. 7. art. 2. Note.\r\n\r\n     'Although the sea and its shores, according to the principles\r\n     of natural law, are things public and common to all, with\r\n     liberty to every one to use them according to their destination,\r\n     nevertheless it ought not to be permitted to some to enjoy\r\n     them to the prejudice of others. Therefore to prevent the\r\n     inconveniences which would result from the liberty of using\r\n     the public property, it is necessary that that liberty be\r\n     limited by the public authority, as explained by Domat,' &c.\r\n\r\n'It is likewise agreeable to the law of nature, that this liberty,\r\nwhich is common to all, being a continual occasion of quarrels,\r\nand of many bad consequences, should be regulated in some\r\nmanner or other; and there could be no regulation more equitable,\r\nnor more natural, than leaving it to the sovereign to provide\r\nagainst the said inconveniences. For as he is charged\r\nwith the care of the public peace and tranquillity, as it is to him\r\nthe care of the order and government of the society belongs, and\r\nit is only in his person that the right to the things which may\r\nbelong in common to the public, of which he is the head, can\r\nreside; he therefore as head of the commonwealth, ought to\r\nhave the dispensation and exercise of this right, that he may\r\nrender it useful to the public. And it is on this foundation that\r\nthe Ordinances of France have regulated the use of navigation,\r\nand of fishing, in the sea and in rivers.' Dom. P. L. 1. 8. 2. 1.\r\nnote. Observe that the work of Domat was published\r\nin 1689, and he died in 1696. *Dict. hist. par une société.\r\n_verbo_ Domat. We know then from him the state\r\nof the laws of France, at a period a little anterior only to the establishment\r\nof the colony of Louisiana, and the transfer of the\r\nlaws of France to that colony by its charter of 1712.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 61*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Levées and Police of Missisipi.]\r\n\r\nTo the provisions which have been thus made by the Roman\r\nand French laws and transferred to Louisiana, no particular additions,\r\nby either the French or Spanish government, have been\r\nproduced on the present occasion. We know the fact, and thence\r\ninfer the law, that from a very early period, the governors of\r\nthat province were attentive especially to whatever respected the\r\nharbor of New-Orleans, which included the grounds now in\r\nquestion. We see them forbidding inclosures, or buildings on\r\nthem, pulling down those built, publishing bans against future\r\nerections, forbidding earth for buildings and streets to be taken\r\nfrom the shore adjacent to the city, and assigning the beach Ste.\r\nMarie for that purpose, protecting all individuals in the equal\r\nuse of it as a Quai, in which cares and superintendence the Cabildo\r\nor City Council, participated; and on the change of government\r\nwe see that council pass an Ordinance declaratory of the\r\nlimits of the port of N. Orleans, and come forward in defence\r\nof the public rights, in the first moment of J. Gravier's intrusion,\r\nby pulling down his inclosure, and when that intrusion under\r\nthe enterprise of Mr. Livingston, assumed a more serious aspect,\r\nthey, as municipal guardians of the interests of the city, made\r\nan immediate appeal to the Judiciary, the Executive, and Legislative\r\nauthorities. In addition, too, to the French\r\nlaws for the protection of the bed and bank of the\r\nriver, the territorial legislature, on the 15th of Feb.\r\n1808, passed an Act, reciting that inasmuch as 'the common\r\nsafety of the inhabitants of the shores of the river Missisipi depends\r\nnot only on the good condition of the levées or embankments,\r\nwhich contain the waters of the said river; but also on\r\nthe strict observance of the laws concerning the police of rivers\r\nand their banks, _which are in force in this territory_, and by\r\nwhich it is forbidden to make on the shores of the rivers, any\r\nwork tending to alter the course of the waters, or increase their\r\nrapidity, or to make their navigation less convenient, or the anchorage\r\nless sure, [almost in the words of the Roman law, 'ne\r\nquid in flumine publico'] they therefore enact that no levée shall\r\nbe made in front of those which exist at present, but on an inquisition\r\nby 12 inhabitants, proprietors of plantations situate on\r\nthe banks of the river, convoked for that purpose, by the Parish\r\njudge; that no such levée, which at the present time of passing\r\nthis act shall happen to be commenced in front of others already\r\nexisting, shall be continued or finished without a\r\nlike authorization;* that those who act in contravention\r\nshall be fined 100 dols. for every offence in contravention,\r\nand pay the expenses of removing the nuisance, and costs\r\nof suit; and prohibiting the receiving compensation for the use\r\nof the shores under a penalty of 500 dols. A law of wonderful,\r\nnot to say imprudent and dangerous tenderness to the riparian\r\nproprietors, who are thus made the sole judges in cases where\r\ntheir own personal interests may be in direct opposition to the\r\ninterests, and even the safety of the city, to which it gives no\r\nparticipation or control over the power which may devote it to\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 62*]\r\n\r\nThis act is partly declaratory of the existing law, and partly\r\nadditional. Application to the Prætor was under the Roman\r\nlaw (Dig. 43. 13. 6.) for permission to fortify a bank for the\r\nprotection of a farm. He might refuse permission if injurious;\r\nbut if he thought it would not be injurious, the party was to\r\ngive security to make good all damages which should accrue\r\nwithin ten years; and this security was for the protection, not\r\nonly of immediate neighbors, but of those also on the opposite\r\nbank 'trans flumen possidentibus.' The Governor and Cabildo\r\nseem to have held this Prætorian power in Louisiana, as well as\r\nthat of demolishing what was unlawfully erected. This act of\r\nthe Legislature, without taking the power from the Governor\r\nand City Council, gave a concurrent power to the parish judge,\r\nand a jury of 12 riparians: and without dispensing with the\r\nsecurity required by the existing law, adds penalties against contraveners.\r\n\r\nAnd surely it is the territorial legislature, which not only has\r\nthe power, but is under the urgent duty, of providing regulations\r\nfor the government of this river and its inhabitants, regulations\r\nadapted to their present political regulations, as well as to the\r\npeculiar character and circumstances of the river, and the adjacent\r\ncountry. Their power is amply given in the act of Congress\r\nof 1804. c. 38. §. 11. 'The laws in force in the said\r\nterritory at the commencement of this act, and not inconsistent\r\nwith the provisions thereof, shall continue in force, until altered,\r\nmodified, or repealed by the legislature. §. 4. The Governor,\r\nby and with advice and consent of the said legislative council,\r\nor of a majority of them, shall have power to alter, modify, and\r\nrepeal the laws which may be in force at the commencement of\r\nthis act. Their legislative powers shall extend to all the rightful\r\nsubjects of legislation;' with special exceptions, none of which\r\ntake away the authority to legislate for the police of the river.\r\nAnd if ever there was a rightful subject of legislation, it is that\r\nof restraining greedy individuals from destroying the country by\r\ninundation.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Suspension of Liv.'s works, by whom?]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 63*]\r\n\r\nAnd here it must be noted that Mr. Livingston's works were\r\narrested by the Marshal and posse comitatus, by an\r\norder from the Secretary of State on the *25th of\r\nJanuary 1808, and on the 15th of the ensuing\r\nmonth, the legislature took the business into the\r\nhands of their own government, by passing this act.\r\nFrom this moment it was in Mr. Livingston's power to resume\r\nhis works, by obtaining permission from the legal authority.\r\nThe suspension of his works therefore by the general government\r\nwas only during these 21 days.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Their nature.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 64*]\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Livingston's works were clearly within the interdict\r\nof the Roman, the French, and the Spanish laws, which forbid\r\nthe extending a mole into the water, constructing in it mills,\r\nfloodgates, canals, towers, houses, cabins, fisheries, stakes or other\r\nthings which may obstruct or embarrass the use, will\r\nresult from a brief recapitulation of their character\r\nand effects, drawn from the statement before given. For it is\r\nnot to establish a mill, which, though an intrusion would be but\r\na partial one: it is not to erect a temporary cabin or fisherman's\r\nhut, which would be a minor obstacle: but it is to take from the\r\ncity and the nation what is their port in high water, and at low\r\ntide their Quai; to leave them not a spot where the upper craft\r\ncan land or lie in safety; to turn the current of the river on the\r\nlower suburbs and plantations; to embank the whole of this extensive\r\nbeach; to take off a fourth from the breadth of the river,\r\nand add equivalently to the rise of its waters; to demolish thus\r\nthe whole levée, and sweep away the town and country in undistinguished\r\nruin. And this not as a matter of theory alone,\r\nbut of experience: the fact being known that since the embankment\r\nof the river on both sides through a space of three or four\r\nhundred miles the floods are two or three feet higher than before\r\nthat embankment. In fine, should they have time to save themselves\r\nfrom inundation by doubling the height and breadth of\r\ntheir levée, it is that they may fall victims to the pestilential diseases\r\nwhich, under their fervid sun, will be generated by the\r\nputrefying mass with which he is to raise up the foundation between\r\nthe old and new embankments. But, has he entitled himself\r\nto attain these humane achievements by fulfilling the preliminary\r\nrequisites of the law? Has he obtained the Prætorian,\r\nor Pro-Prætorian license, that of the governor and city council,\r\nto erect this embankment? Has he given security for all the\r\ndamages which shall be occasioned by his works for ten years?\r\nHas he even carried his case before a jury of 12 brother riparians?\r\nOr does he fear to trust it even to those having similar interests\r\nwith himself? lest the virtuous feelings of compunction for the\r\nfate of their fellow citizens should scout his proposition with\r\nhonest indignation? And yet, until this permission, every spadeful\r\nof earth he moved was an outrage on the law, and on the\r\npublic peace and safety, which called for immediate suppression*.\r\nWhat was to be done with such an aggressor? Shall we answer\r\nin the words of the Imperial edict, on a similar occasion,\r\nthat of breaking the banks of the Nile? Cod. 9. 38. 'Flammis\r\neo loco consumatur, in quo vetustatis reverentiam,\r\net propemodum ipsius imperii appetierit securitatem; consciis et\r\nconsortibus ejus deportatione constringendis; sic ut nunquam supplicandi,\r\neis, vel recipiendi civitatem vel dignitatem, vel substantiam,\r\nlicentia tribuatur.' 'Let him be consumed by the flames\r\nin that spot in which he violated the reverence of antiquity, and\r\nthe safety of the empire, let his accessories and accomplices be\r\ncut off by deportation from the possibility of supplicating forgiveness,\r\nor of being restored to country, dignity and possessions.'\r\nOur horror is not the less because our laws are more\r\nlenient.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Remedies.]\r\n\r\nSuch, then, were the facts, and such the state of the law, on\r\nwhich we were called, and repeatedly and urgently\r\ncalled to decide: not indeed in all the fulness in\r\nwhich they have since appeared, but sufficiently manifested to\r\nshow that an atrocious enterprise was in a course of execution,\r\nwhich if not promptly arrested, would end in a desolation for\r\nwhich we could never answer. The question before us was,\r\nWhat is to be done? What remedy can we apply, authorized\r\nby the laws, and prompt enough to arrest the mischief?\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Abatement of Nuisance.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 65*]\r\n\r\n1. Were the case within the jurisdiction of our own laws, its\r\ncharacter and remedy would be obvious enough. A\r\nnavigable river is a high way, along which all are\r\nfree to pass. And as the obstructing a highway on\r\nthe land, by ditches or hedges, or logs across it, or erecting a\r\ngate across it, is a common nuisance, so to weaken injuriously\r\nthe current of a river, by drawing off a part of its water, to obstruct\r\nit by moles, dykes, weirs, piles, or otherwise, is a common\r\nnuisance; and all authorities agree, that every one is allowed to\r\nremove or destroy a common nuisance. Hawkins, P. C. 1. 75.\r\n12. The Marshal and posse, instead of pleading the order from\r\nthe Secretary of State, have a right to say 'we did this as citizens,\r\nand the law is our authority:' and it would really be singular\r\nif, what every man may, or may not do, at his pleasure, the\r\nmagistrate who is sworn to see the law executed, and is charged\r\nwith the care of the public property and rights, is alone prohibited\r\nfrom doing; or if his order should vitiate an act which\r\nwithout it would have been lawful, or which he might have\r\nexecuted in person. It would be equally singular, and equally\r\nabsurd, that the law should punish the magistrate for hindering\r\nMr. Livingston from doing what itself had forbidden and would\r\npunish, and reward him with damages for having been\r\nrestrained *from what they had forbidden him to do.\r\nThe law makes it a duty in a bystander to lay hands on\r\na man who is beating another in the street, and to take him off.\r\nAnd yet it is proposed that the same law shall punish him for\r\ntaking off one who was engaged, not in beating a single individual,\r\nbut in drowning a whole city and country. This is not\r\nour law; it is not the law of reason; and I am persuaded it is no\r\npart of a system emphatically called _ratio scripta_. If it is, let\r\nthe law be produced. Until it is, we hold every man authorized\r\nto stay a wrongdoer, in the commission of a wrong, in which\r\nhimself and all others are interested.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Forcible entry.]\r\n\r\n2. By nature's law, every man has a right to seize and retake\r\nby force, his own property, taken from him by another,\r\nby force or fraud. Nor is this natural right\r\namong the first which is taken into the hands of regular government,\r\nafter it is instituted. It was long retained by our ancestors.\r\nIt was a part of their Common law, laid down in their\r\nbooks, recognised by all the authorities, and regulated as to certain\r\ncircumstances of practice. Lambard, in his Eirenarcha. B.\r\n2. e. 4. says, 'it seemeth that (before the troublesome raigne of\r\nking Richard the second,) the Common law permitted any person\r\n(which had good right or title to enter into any land,) to win\r\nthe possession by force, if otherwise he could not have obtained\r\nit. For a man may see, (in Britton fo. 115.) that a certain respite\r\nof time was given to the disseisee, (according to his distance\r\nand absence,) in which it was lawful for him to gather force,\r\narmes, and his friends, and to throw the disseisor out of his\r\nwrongful possession.' Hawkins in his Pleas of the crown, and\r\nall the Abridgements and Digests of the law say the same: but,\r\nnot to take it at second hand, we will recur to the earliest authorities,\r\nwritten while it was yet the law of the land. Fleta in the\r\ntime of E. 1. writes,\r\n\r\n     'Si facta fuerit diseissina, primum et principale competit\r\n     remedium quod ille qui ita disseisitus est, per se, si possit,\r\n     vel sumptis viribus, vel resumptis (dum tamen sine aliquo\r\n     intervallo, flagrante disseisinâ et maleficio) rejiciat\r\n     spoliantem. Quem si nullo modo expellere possit, ad superioris\r\n     auxilium erit recurrendum. Si autem verus possessor absens\r\n     fuerit, tunc locorum distantia distinguere oportebit, secundem\r\n     quod fuerit propè vel longè, quo tempore viz. scire potuit\r\n     disseisinam esse factam, ut sic, allocatis ei rationabilibus\r\n     dilationibus, primo die cum venerit, statim suum dejiciat\r\n     disseisitorem; qui, si primo die, non possit, in crastino, vel\r\n     die tertio vel ulterius, dum tamen sine fictitiâ, hoc facere\r\n     poterit, vires sibi resumendo, arma colligendo, auxiliumque\r\n     amicorum convocando.' Fleta L. 4. c. 2. And Bracton L. 4. c.\r\n     6. in almost totidem verbis; and Britton 'le premer remedie\r\n     pour disseisine est al disseisi de recollier amys et force et\r\n     sauns delay faire (après ceo que il le purra saver) egetter\r\n     les disseisours.' Britton c. 44.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 66*]\r\n\r\n     'If a disseisin has been committed, a first and principal\r\n     remedy lies, that he who has been so disseised, by himself, if\r\n     he can, or taking force, and retaking, (provided it be without\r\n     any interval, the disseisin and wrong being yet flagrant,)\r\n     may eject the spoliator. Whom, if he can by no means expel,\r\n     resort is to be had to the assistance of a superior. But if\r\n     the rightful possessor were absent, then, regard must *be had\r\n     to the distance of the places, according as it was near or far\r\n     off, at what time, for instance, he could know that a disseisin\r\n     had been committed, that so, reasonable delays being allowed\r\n     him, on the first day when he comes, he may immediately eject\r\n     the disseisor, which if he cannot do on the first day, he may\r\n     on the morrow, or third day, or later, provided however he\r\n     do it without false pretences, by taking to himself force,\r\n     collecting arms, and calling in the aid of his friends.' And\r\n     Bracton L. 4. c. 6. almost in the same words; and Britton\r\n     says, 'The first remedy for disseisin is for the disseisee to\r\n     collect his friends and force, and without delay, (after he\r\n     may know of it,) to eject the disseisors.'\r\n\r\nThis right, as to real property, was first restrained in England\r\nby a statute of the 5. R. 2. c. 7. which forbade entry into lands\r\nwith strong hand; and another of the same reign, 15. R. 2. c. 2.\r\nauthorized immediate restitution to the wrong doer, put out by\r\nforcible entry. And even at this day, in an _action_ of trespass,\r\nfor an entry, _vi et armis_, if the defendant makes good title, he\r\nis maintained in his possession, and the plaintiff recovers no\r\ndamages for the force. Lambard 2. 4. Hawk. P. C. 1. 64. 3.\r\nAnd in like manner, the natural right of recaption by force still\r\nexists, as to personal goods, and the validity of their recaption.\r\nHawk. 1. 64. 1. Kelway 92. is express. Blackstone, indeed, 3.\r\n1. 2. limits the right of recaption to a peaceable one, not amounting\r\nto a breach of the peace; meaning, I presume, that the recaptor\r\nby force may be punished for the breach of the peace.\r\nSo may the defendant in trespass for an entry _vi et armis_. Yet\r\nin an _action_ of detinue for the personal thing retaken by force,\r\nthe first wrong doer cannot recover it, nor damages for the recaption,\r\nany more than in the case of trespass for lands. So that\r\nto this day the law supports the right of recaption, as between\r\nthe parties, although it will punish the public offence of a breach\r\nof the peace.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Roman law.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 67*]\r\n\r\nWhen this natural right was first restrained among the Romans,\r\nI am not versed enough in their laws to say.\r\nIt was not by the laws of the XII tables, which continued\r\n*long their only laws. From the expression\r\nof the Institute, '_divalibus constitutionibus_,' I should\r\ninfer it was first restrained by some of the Emperors, predecessors\r\nof Justinian. L. 4. t. 2. §. 2.\r\n\r\n     'Divalibus constitutionibus prospectum est, ut nemini liceat\r\n     vi rapere vel rem mobilem, vel se moventem, licet suam eandem\r\n     rem existimat. Quod non solum in mobilibus rebus, quæ rapi\r\n     possunt, constitutiones obtinere censuerunt, sed etiam in\r\n     invasionibus, quæ circa res soli fiunt.'\r\n\r\n     'By the Imperial constitutions it is provided that no one shall\r\n     take by force a thing either moveable, or moving, although he\r\n     considers it as his own. Which the constitutions have ordained\r\n     to take place, not only in moveable things, which may be taken,\r\n     but also in intrusions which are made into lands.'\r\n\r\nBut I believe that no nation has ever yet restrained itself in\r\nthe exercise of this natural right of reseising its own possessions,\r\nor bound up its own hands in the manacles and cavils of litigation.\r\nIt takes possession of its own at short hand, and gives to\r\nthe private claimant a specified mode of preferring his claim.\r\nThere are cases, of particular circumstance, where the sovereign,\r\nas by the English law, must institute a previous inquest: but in\r\ngeneral cases as the present, he enters at once on what belongs\r\nto his nation. This is the law of England. 'Whenever the\r\nking's [i.e. the nation's] title appears of record, or a possession\r\nin law be called upon him by descent, escheat, &c., he may\r\nenter without an office found: for if his title appear any way of\r\nrecord, it is as good as if it were found by office: and if any one\r\nenter on him, even before his entry made, he is an intruder; he\r\ncannot gain any freehold in the land, nor does he put the king\r\nto an assize or ejectment, or take away his right of entry: for\r\nhe cannot be disseised but by record. Stamford. Prærogativa\r\nregis. 56. 57. Com. Dig. Prærog. D. 71. the substance of the\r\nauthorities cited.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Squatters.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 68*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Jurisdiction in whom.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: When it results to Courts.]\r\n\r\nWhat are the prescriptions of the Roman law in this case, I do\r\nnot know; nor are they material but inasmuch as they may be\r\nthe law of the case in Louisiana. A Spanish law before cited,\r\np. 55. forbidding erections on the beds, or on the banks of rivers,\r\nsays expressly, 'si alguno lo ficiese debe ser deribado.' 'If any\r\none does it, it is to be destroyed.' And the constant practice of\r\nthe Governors of demolishing such erections was the best evidence\r\nof the law we could obtain. Not skilled in their laws\r\nourselves, we had certainly a right to consider the Governor and\r\nCabildo as competent expositors of them, and as acting under\r\ntheir justification and prescription. We might reasonably\r\nthink ourselves safe *in their opinions of their own law.\r\nIn fact, if the immediate entry was permitted by the English\r\nlaw, and our own, we thought we might, _à fortiori_, conclude\r\nit permitted by those of the province. We had before\r\nus too the example of many of the states, and of\r\nthe general government itself, which have never hesitated to remove\r\nby force the Squatters and intruders on the public lands.[101]\r\nIndeed if the nation were put to action against every Squatter,\r\nfor the recovery of their lands, we should only have lawsuits,\r\nnot lands for sale. While troops are on parade, should intruders\r\ntake possession of their barracks, and shut the doors, are they to\r\nremain in the open air till an action, or even a writ of forcible\r\nentry replace them in their quarters? if in the interval of a daily\r\nadjournment, intruders take possession of the capitol, may not\r\nCongress take their seats again till an inquisition and posse shall\r\nreintroduce them? let him who can, draw a line between\r\nthese cases. The correct doctrine is that so\r\nlong as the nation holds lands in its own possession,\r\nso long they are under the jurisdiction of no court, but by special\r\nprovision. The United States cannot be sued. The nation, by\r\nits immediate representatives, administers justice itself to all who\r\nhave claims upon the public property. Hence the numerous petitions\r\nwhich occupy so much of every session of Congress in\r\ncases which have not been confided to the courts. But when\r\nonce they have granted the lands to individuals,\r\nthen the jurisdiction of the courts over them commences.\r\nThey fall then into the common mass of\r\nmatter justiciable before the courts. If the public has granted\r\nlands to B. which were the legal property of A., A. may bring\r\nhis action against B. and the courts are competent to do him\r\njustice. The moment B. attempts to take possession of A.'s\r\nlands, the writ of forcible entry, the action of trespass or ejectment,\r\nand the Chancery process, furnish him a choice of remedies.\r\nThe holders of property therefore are safe against individuals\r\nby the law; and they are safe against the Nation by its\r\nown justice: and all the alarm which some have endeavored to\r\nexcite on this subject has been merely _ad captandum populum_.\r\nAs if the people would not be safe in their own hands, or in\r\nthose of their representatives; or safer in the hands of irresponsible\r\njudges, than of persons elected by themselves annually or\r\nbiannually. The truth is, no injury can be done to any man\r\nby another acting either in his own or a public character, which\r\nmay not be redressed by application to the proper organ to\r\nwhich that portion of the administration of justice has been assigned.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Act of Congress.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 69*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Remitter.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 70*]\r\n\r\n3. Our third and conclusive remedy was that prescribed by\r\nthe act of Congress of 1807. c. 91. to prevent *settlements\r\non lands ceded to the U. S. The Executive\r\nhad been indulgent, perhaps remiss, in not removing\r\nSquatters from the public lands, under the general\r\nprinciples of law before explained and habitually acted on. This\r\nact therefore was a recent call on them to a more vigilant performance\r\nof their duty, in the special district of country lately\r\nceded to them by France, with some modifications of its exercise\r\non previous settlers. The act has two distinct classes of\r\nIntruders in view. 1. Those who, _before the passing of the act_,\r\nhad possessed themselves of the lands, and were actually resident\r\non them at the passing it: and 2. Those who should take possession\r\n_after the passage of the act_. 1. With respect to the class\r\nof Intruders _before_ the passage of the act, the 2d section provides\r\nthat, on renouncing all claim, they may obtain from the register\r\nor recorder, permission to remain on the lands, extending their\r\noccupation to 320 acres, §. 8. which permissions are to be recorded:\r\nbut, §. 4. those not obtaining permission are, on three\r\nmonths' notice, to be removed by the marshal. But Mr. Livingston\r\nwas much too wise to qualify himself for the benefit of these\r\nsections, by an actual residence on the batture. _His_ part of the\r\nact therefore is the first section which enacts that 'if any person\r\nshall take possession of any lands ceded to the U. S. by treaty,\r\nhe shall forfeit all right to them if any he hath; and it shall be\r\nlawful for the President of the U. S. to direct the Marshal, or\r\nthe military, to remove him from the lands. Providing however\r\nthat this removal shall not affect his claim until the Commissioners\r\nshall have made their reports, and Congress decided thereon.'\r\nThe tribunal to which the legislature had specially delegated a\r\npower to take cognizance of the claims on the public lands in\r\nOrleans, and to inform them what lands were clear of claim, and\r\nfree to be granted to our citizens, was a board of Commissioners:\r\nand the plain words and scope of the law were, to keep all\r\nclaims and prior possessions _in statu quo_, until they could be\r\ninvestigated by these Commissioners, reported, and decided on by\r\nCongress. And this act indulgently provides that the right of a\r\nperson removed by the Executive for irregularly taking possession\r\nof lands which he thought his own, should not be affected\r\nby this removal, but that he might still lay his claim before the\r\nCommissioners, and Congress would decide on it. Mr. Livingston's\r\nclaim was clearly within the purview of the law. It was\r\nof lands 'ceded to the U. S. by treaty,' and he had 'taken possession\r\nof them _after the passage of the act_.' For the decree\r\nof the court was not till May 23, '07, and his possession was\r\nsubsequent to that. If he should say, as his counsel\r\nseems to intimate, Opinions LXVII. that this\r\nwas a _remitter_ to him of the ancient possession* of\r\nBertrand Gravier, I answer that it was no remitter\r\nagainst any one, because the case was _coram non judice_, as will\r\nbe shown, and still less against the U. S. who were no parties to\r\nthe suit: and if it had been a remitter, then I should have observed\r\nthat the order has been executed on a person not comprehended\r\nin it; for it was expressly restrained to possessions taken\r\nafter the 3d of March '07, in that case the Marshal must justify\r\nhimself, not under the order, but his personal right to remove a\r\nnuisance. But investigations, reports, and decisions of Congress\r\nwere dangerous. It was safer to be his own judge, to seize\r\nboldly, and put the public on the defensive. He seizes the\r\nground he claims, and refers his title to no competent tribunal.\r\nWhen ousted, according to the injunctions of the statute, and\r\nrepossession taken on behalf of the U. S. he passes by the preparatory\r\ntribunal of the Commissioners, and endeavors to obtain\r\na decision on his case by Congress, in the first instance: in this\r\ntoo he has been disappointed. Congress have maintained the\r\nground taken under the statute; and Mr. Livingston now demands\r\nthe value of the lands from the magistrate on whom devolved\r\nthe duty of executing the statute.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Recapitulation.]\r\n\r\nTaking now a brief review of the whole ground we have\r\ngone over, we may judge of the correctness of the\r\ndecision of the Cabinet, as to their duty in this case.\r\nI trust it will appear to every candid and unbiassed mind, that\r\nthey were not mistaken in believing\r\n\r\n     That the Customs of Paris, the Ordinances of the French\r\n     government, the Roman law as a supplement to both, with the\r\n     special acts of the Spanish and American legislatures, composed\r\n     that system of law which was to govern their proceedings.\r\n\r\n     That, were this a case of Alluvion, the French law gives it to\r\n     the Sovereign in all cases; and the Roman law to the private\r\n     holder of _rural_ possessions only.\r\n\r\n     That Bertrand Gravier had converted his plantations into a\r\n     fauxbourg, and appendage of the city of New-Orleans; with the\r\n     _previous_ sanction of the Spanish government, according to\r\n     his own declarations, by which those claiming under him are\r\n     as much bound, as if made by themselves; and certainly by its\r\n     _subsequent_ formal recognitions, and confirmations, which\r\n     acted retrospectively; and the character of the ground being\r\n     thus changed from a Rural to an Urban possession, the Roman\r\n     law of Alluvion does not act on it. Recapitulation.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 71*]\r\n\r\n     That even had his ground retained its _rural_ character, and\r\n     admitting that the grant to him '_face au fleuve_' conveyed\r\n     the lands to the water's edge, his sales, '_face au fleuve_'\r\n     conveyed to his* purchasers the same right which the same terms\r\n     had brought to him, and they, and not the plaintiff, now hold\r\n     the rights of B. Gravier, whatever they were.\r\n\r\n     That John Gravier having elected to take the estate as a\r\n     purchaser by inventory and appraisement, the Batture, if\r\n     Bertrand's, was not in that inventory, nor consequently\r\n     purchased by John Gravier.\r\n\r\n     That the deed from him to De la Bigarre was fraudulent and void,\r\n     as well by the _lex loci_, as on the face of the transaction.\r\n\r\n     That the decision of the court in his favor could in no wise\r\n     concern the United States, who were neither parties to the\r\n     suit, nor amenable to the jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n     And, consequently, that under all these views of the French\r\n     law: the Roman law, the conveyances '_face au fleuve_,' the\r\n     purchase by inventory, and the fraudulency of the deed to\r\n     Bigarre, the plaintiff's claim is totally unfounded. And, if\r\n     void by any one of them, it is as good as if void by every one.\r\n\r\n     But it has appeared further that the batture had not a single\r\n     characteristic of alluvion:\r\n\r\n     That the _bank_ of a river is only what is above the high\r\n     water mark:\r\n\r\n     That all below that mark is _bed_, or alveus, of which the\r\n     batture is that portion between the high and low water mark,\r\n     which we call the _beach_:\r\n\r\n     That it serves, as other beaches do, for a port while covered,\r\n     and Quai uncovered: and it is the only port in the vicinity\r\n     of the city which river craft can use.\r\n\r\n     That, as a part of the _bed_ of the river, it is purely public\r\n     property.\r\n\r\n     That it is not lawful for an individual to erect, on either\r\n     the bed or bank of a river, any works which may affect the\r\n     convenience of navigation, of the harbor or Quai, or endanger\r\n     adjacent proprietors on either side of the river.\r\n\r\n     That though it is permissible to guard our own grounds against\r\n     the current of the river, yet, so only, as to be consistent\r\n     with the convenience and safety of others.\r\n\r\n     That of this the legal magistrates are to be judges in the first\r\n     instance; but even _their_ errors are to be guarded against\r\n     by an indemnification for all damages which shall actually\r\n     accrue to individuals within a given time.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 72*]\r\n\r\n     That Mr. Livingston's works, in a single flood, had given\r\n     alarming extent, both in breadth and height, to the batture:\r\n     had turned the efforts of the river against the lower suburbs,\r\n     and habitations, not before exposed to them; that they would\r\n     deprive the public of what was their Quai in low water, and\r\n     harbor* in times of flood: that, by narrowing the river one\r\n     fourth, it must raise it in an equivalent proportion, to\r\n     discharge its waters: that this would sweep away the levée,\r\n     city, and country, or quadruple the bulk of the levée, and\r\n     the increased danger to which that would expose it: and,\r\n     even then, would infect the city, by the putridity of the new\r\n     congestions, with pestilential diseases, to which its climate\r\n     is already too much predisposed.\r\n\r\n     That Mr. Livingston was doing all this, of his own authority,\r\n     without asking permission from the public magistrate, or giving\r\n     any security for the indemnity of injured citizens:\r\n\r\n     That under the pressure of these dangers, the Executive of\r\n     the nation was called on to do his duty, and to extend the\r\n     protection of the law to those against whose safety these\r\n     outrages were directed:\r\n\r\n     And that the authorities given by the laws, 1. For preventing\r\n     obstructions in the beds, or banks of rivers, 2. For re-seizing\r\n     public property intruded on; and 3. For removing intruders\r\n     from it by force, were adequate to the object, if promptly\r\n     interposed.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Orders of the Government.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Proceedings under them.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 73*]\r\n\r\nOn duly weighing the information before us, which though\r\nnot as ample as has since been received, was abundantly\r\nsufficient to satisfy us of the facts, and has\r\nbeen confirmed by all subsequent testimony, we were\r\nall unanimously of opinion, that we were authorized, and in duty\r\nbound, without delay, to arrest the aggressions of Mr. Livingston\r\non the public rights, and on the peace and safety of the city\r\nof New-Orleans, and that orders should be immediately dispatched\r\nfor that purpose, restrained to intruders since the passage\r\nof the act of March 3. The Secretary of State accordingly\r\nwrote the letter of Nov. 30, to the Governor, covering instructions\r\nfor the Marshal to remove immediately, by the civil power,\r\nany persons from the batture Ste. Marie, who had taken possession\r\nsince the 3d of March, and authorising the Governor, if\r\nnecessary, to use military force; for which purpose a letter of the\r\nsame date was written by the Secretary at war to the commanding\r\nofficer at New-Orleans. This force however was not called\r\non. The instructions to the Marshal were delivered to him\r\nabout 9 o'clock in the morning of the 25th of Jan. 1808. [Dorgenoy's\r\nletter to the Governor] He immediately went to the\r\nbeach, and ordered off Mr. Livingston's laborers.\r\nThey obeyed, but soon after returned. On being\r\nordered off a second time, the principal person told\r\nhim that he was commanded by Mr. Livingston not to give up\r\nthe batture until an adequate armed force should compel him.\r\nAnd, in the mean time, Mr. Livingston had procured,\r\nfrom a single judge of the superior court of the territory,*\r\nan order, purporting to be an injunction, forbidding the\r\nmarshal to disturb Edward Livingston in his possession of the\r\nbatture, under pain of a contempt of court. The marshal, placed\r\nbetween contradictory orders, of the national government as to\r\nthe property of the nation, and a territorial judge without jurisdiction\r\nover it, obeyed the former; collected a posse comitatus,\r\nordered off the laborers again, who peaceably retired; and no\r\nfurther attempts were afterwards made to recommence the work.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Chancery Jurisdiction.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 74*]\r\n\r\nI have said that the marshal received an order, purporting to\r\nbe an injunction. An authoritative injunction it\r\ncould not be; because that is a Chancery process,\r\nand no Chancery jurisdiction has been given by any\r\nlaw to the superior court of that territory. Its judges were first\r\nestablished by the act of Congress of 1804. c. 38. with commissions\r\nfor four years, and certain specified powers, which it is\r\nunnecessary to state, because an act of March 2, of the next\r\nyear, c. 83. established, in that territory, 'a government in all\r\nrespects similar to that exercised in the Missisipi territory,' which\r\ngovernment had been established by an act of 1798. c. 5. 'in\r\nall respects similar to that in the territory North-west of the\r\nOhio.' So that we are to find all their powers in the Ordinance\r\nof 1787, for the North-Western territory, in which are the following\r\nwords. 'There shall be appointed a court to consist of\r\nthree judges, any two of whom to form a court, who shall have\r\n_a common law jurisdiction_, and their commissions shall continue\r\nin force during good behavior.' And again 'The inhabitants of\r\nthe said territory shall always be entitled to the benefits of the\r\nwrit of _Habeas corpus_, and of the trial by jury.' New commissions\r\nwere accordingly given to the judges appointed under\r\nthe first law, and, instead of their former powers, they were now\r\nto have _a common law jurisdiction_. By these words certainly\r\nno _chancery jurisdiction_ was given them. Every one knows\r\nthat common law jurisdiction is a technical term, used in contradistinction\r\nto a chancery jurisdiction, and exclusive of that, the\r\ncommon law ending where the chancery begins. The one authority\r\nis here given, and therefore they have it; the other is not\r\ngiven, and therefore they have it not. For they have no authority\r\nbut that which is given by the legislature. If they have not\r\nchancery powers, then, by this law, there remains but one other\r\nsource from which they can legally derive it. The act of 1804\r\nbefore mentioned § 11, says, 'the laws in force in the said territory,\r\nat the commencement of this act, and not inconsistent\r\nwith the provisions thereof, shall continue in force until altered,\r\nmodified, or repealed by the legislature.' We have seen that\r\nthe laws in force were the French and Roman, with perhaps\r\nsome occasional Spanish regulations. It being perfectly understood\r\nthat these were not meant to be included in the\r\n*change, it follows that the term _common law_, when\r\napplied to this territory, must be equivalent to the common\r\nlaw of that land, or the law of the land. Was then the\r\nestablishment of the French and Roman laws an establishment\r\nof the chancery system of law? Will it be said that the Roman\r\nand Chancery laws, for instance, are the same? That the _civil\r\nlaw_, and the _chancery_ are synonymous terms, both meaning the\r\nsame system? Nobody will say that. The system of chancery\r\nlaw is partly concurrent, but chiefly supplementary and corrective\r\nof that of the common law. It sometimes corrects the\r\nharshness of the letter, where that includes what was not intended.\r\nIt gives remedies in certain cases where that gave\r\nnone, and more perfect remedies in other cases. It is adapted\r\nto the common law as one part of an indenture is to its counterpart.\r\nIt is formed to tally with that in all its prominences and\r\nrecesses, its asperities and defects, and with no other body of\r\nlaw on earth. It consists of a set of rules and maxims, modified\r\nby the English Chancellors thro' a course of several centuries,\r\nderived from no foreign model, but contrived to reduce specifically\r\nthe principles of common law to those of justice. The\r\nRoman law has something similar in its _Jus Prætorium_, where\r\nthe discretion of the Prætor was permitted to mollify and correct\r\nthe harshness of the _leges scriptæ_. But to apply the _Jus Prætorium_\r\nto our common law, or our chancery to the _leges scriptæ_\r\nof the Romans, would be to apply to one thing the tally of another,\r\nor to mismatch the parts of different machines, so as to\r\nrender them inconsistent and impracticable. Our chancery system\r\nis as different from the civil, as from the common law. All\r\nsystems of law indeed profess to be founded on the principles of\r\njustice. But the superstructures erected are totally distinct.\r\nThe chancery then being a system clearly distinct from that of\r\nthe French and Roman laws, it cannot be said that the legislature\r\nof the U. S. by establishing the French and Roman laws\r\nin Orleans, established there the chancery system. It will not\r\nbe pretended that the process of _subpœna_, used in the present\r\ncase, and the sole and peculiar original process of chancery, is a\r\ncivil law process. It is known to have been the invention of\r\nWaltham, Chancellor of Richard II. founded on the statute of\r\nWestminster the 2d c. 24. giving writs _in consimili casu_.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 75*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 76*]\r\n\r\nMight it be urged (for I am really at a loss to conjecture on\r\nwhat grounds this power has been assumed) that possessing\r\nunder the act of '04, the powers of the chancery combined with\r\nthose of the French and Roman laws, the subsequent act which\r\ngave them a common law jurisdiction, did not take away the\r\nothers? _In totidem verbis_ it did not, but in effect it did completely,\r\nby changing the government into one in all respects\r\nsimilar to that in the Missisipi territory, where there was no\r\nchancery jurisdiction. Moreover, there is not a word in the act\r\nof '04, which gives them *chancery jurisdiction. It says, 'they\r\nshall have jurisdiction in all criminal cases, and original\r\nand appellate jurisdiction in all civil cases of the value of\r\n100 dollars, and the laws in force at the commencement\r\nof this act shall continue in force.' Here then is their jurisdiction,\r\nand the particular system of law according to which they\r\nare to exercise it, and the chancery made no part of that system.\r\nThis argument too would suppose that to the French, the Roman,\r\nthe Spanish, and the Chancery laws, the common law was\r\nalso added. This would be an extraordinary spectacle, indeed,\r\nand the imputation of such an intention would be an insult to\r\nthe legislature. Their laws have always some rational object\r\nin view; and are so to be construed, as to produce order and\r\njustice. But this construction, establishing so many systems,\r\nand these inconsistent and contradictory, would produce anarchy\r\nand chaos, and a dissolution of all law, of all rights of person or\r\nproperty. And what would be the consequences of carrying on\r\na system of chancery concurrent with the French and Roman\r\nlaws? A case is brought, for instance, into their court of chancery.\r\nI ask the honorable judges, is the law of chancery in this\r\ncase, the same as the civil law? If the same, what need of calling\r\nin the system of chancery? If different, will you decide\r\nagainst the law established by the legislature? If you carry on\r\ntwo systems, the one of which, in any case, gives a right to A.\r\nand the other to B. the suitor who covets his neighbor's property\r\nneeds only to chuse that court, the rules of which will give it to\r\nhim. Thus all rights will be set afloat between two opposite\r\nsystems. The wisdom of the legislature therefore has been as\r\nsound in not giving a chancery jurisdiction concurrently with\r\nthe civil law, as the judges have been ill-advised in usurping it.\r\nAnd have they adverted to the national feelings, when they have\r\nventured, on their own authority, to abolish the trial by jury\r\npledged by the Ordinance to the inhabitants forever? Whoever\r\nwishes to take from his opponent the benefit of this trial,\r\nhas only to bring his suit in the court of chancery. In this very\r\ncase, on which the well-being of a great city is suspended, no\r\njury was called in. The judges took upon themselves to decide\r\nboth fact and law; aware, at the same time, that a jury could not\r\nhave been found in Orleans, which would not have given a contrary\r\ndecision. I shall not ascribe either favoritism, or intentional\r\nwrong to them: but they ought not to be surprised, if those\r\ndo whose interests and safety are so much jeopardised by this\r\nshuffle of the judges into the place of the jury. It is much regretted\r\nthat these respectable judges have set such an example\r\nof acting against law. It will be more regretted if they do not,\r\nby the spontaneous exertion of their own good sense and self-denial,\r\ntread back their steps, and perceive that there is\r\nmore honor and magnanimity in correcting, than *persevering\r\nin an error. They had before them too the example\r\nof their neighbors, of the Missisipi territory, whose government\r\nwas expressly made the model of theirs. Their judges,\r\nlike themselves, entitled to common law jurisdiction only, and\r\nsensible it needed the mollifying hand of the chancery, did not\r\nthink the assumption of it within their competence. The territorial\r\nlegislature therefore invested them with the jurisdiction.\r\nThe Judiciary power of the Indian territory modelled by the\r\nsame Ordinance, was enlarged in like manner by the local legislature.\r\nAnd yet the Orleans territory, least of all needed the aid\r\nof a Chancery, as possessing already a corresponding corrective,\r\nwell adapted to the body of their law, to which the system of\r\nChancery was entirely inapplicable.\r\n\r\nAlthough I had before noted, pages 16, 68. that the decree of\r\nthis court was a nullity as to the United States, 1. Because\r\nthey were not a party, nor amenable to their tribunal; 2. Because\r\nalso it was on a subject over which they had no jurisdiction,\r\nI have thought it useful to prove it a nullity; 3dly. Because\r\nthe result of a process, and a course of pleading and trial belonging\r\nto a court whose powers they do not possess by law, in\r\nwhich course of action the law considers them as mere private\r\npersons, is entitled to the obedience of no one. I have done this\r\nthe rather because it has been seized as a ground of censure on\r\nthe Executive, as violating the sanctuary of the judicial department,\r\nand of inculpating the Marshal, who, placed between two\r\nconflicting authorities, had to decide which was legitimate, and\r\ndecided correctly, as I trust appears, in obeying that which ordered\r\nhim to remove the plaintiff from an usurped possession.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Act of territorial Legislature.]\r\n\r\nThe territorial legislature, three weeks after, took up the subject,\r\nand passed an act prescribing in what manner\r\nriparian proprietors should proceed, who wished to\r\nmake new embankments in advance of those existing.\r\nThis gave to Mr. Livingston an easy mode of applying\r\nfor permission to resume his enterprise; and had he obtained a\r\nregular permission, certainly it would have been duly respected\r\nby the National Executive. On the 1st of March I received\r\nfrom Governor Claiborne a letter of Jan. 29. informing me of the\r\nexecution of our orders, and covering a vote of thanks from the\r\nlegislative council and House of Representatives of Orleans, for\r\nour interposition: and on the 7th of the same month, I laid the\r\ncase before Congress by the following message.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Message to Congress.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 77*]\r\n\r\n'To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\nStates. In the city of New-Orleans and adjacent to\r\nit are sundry parcels of ground, some of them with\r\nbuildings and other improvements on them, which\r\nit is my duty to present to the attention of the legislature.\r\nThe title to *these grounds appears to have\r\nbeen retained in the former sovereigns of the province\r\nof Louisiana, as public fiduciaries, and for the purposes of the\r\nprovince. Some of them were used for the residence of the\r\nGovernor, for public offices, hospitals, barracks, magazines, fortifications,\r\nlevées, &c. others for the town house, schools, markets,\r\nlandings, and other purposes of the city of N. Orleans. Some\r\nwere held by religious corporations, or persons; others seem to\r\nhave been reserved for future disposition.\r\n\r\nTo these must be added a parcel called the batture, which requires\r\nmore particular description. It is understood to have\r\nbeen a shoal, or elevation of the bottom of the river, adjacent\r\nto the bank of the suburb St. Mary, produced by the successive\r\ndepositions of mud during the annual inundations of the river,\r\nand covered with water only during those inundations. At all\r\nother seasons it has been used by the city, immemorially, to furnish\r\nearth for raising their streets, and court yards, for mortar\r\nand other necessary purposes, and as a landing or Quai for unlading\r\nfirewood, lumber, and other articles brought by water.\r\nThis having lately been claimed by a private individual, the\r\ncity opposed the claim on a supposed legal title in itself: but it\r\nhas been adjudged that the legal title was not in the city. It is\r\nhowever alleged that that title, originally in the former sovereigns,\r\nwas never parted with by them, but was retained by\r\nthem for the uses of the city and province, and consequently has\r\nnow passed over to the U. S. Until this question can be decided\r\nunder legislative authority, measures have been taken\r\naccording to law, to prevent any change in the state of things,\r\nand to keep the grounds clear of intruders. The settlement of\r\nthis title, the appropriation of the grounds and improvements\r\nformerly occupied for provincial purposes to the same, or such\r\nother objects as may be better suited to present circumstances;\r\nthe confirmation of the uses in other parcels to such bodies corporate,\r\nor private, as may of right, or on other reasonable considerations,\r\nexpect them, are matters now submitted to the\r\ndetermination of the legislature. The paper and plans now\r\ntransmitted, will give them such information on the subjects as I\r\npossess, and, being mostly originals, I must request that they\r\nmay be communicated from the one to the other house, to answer\r\nthe purposes of both. TH: JEFFERSON. _March 7, 1808._'\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Removal of the case before them.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 78*]\r\n\r\nThis removal of the case before Congress closed the official\r\nduties of the Executive, and his interference respecting\r\nthese grounds: except that the attorney of the\r\nUnited States for the district of Orleans having given\r\nwritten permission to the inhabitants to use the batture as before,\r\nthis, on the application of Mr. Livingston, was directed to be\r\nwithdrawn by a letter from the Secretary of State, of\r\nOct. 5. '09. This was correct. It placed the inhabitants\r\nexactly *on their former footing, without either permission\r\nor prohibition on the part of the National government.\r\n\r\nThe _possession_, the only charge of the Executive, was now\r\ncleared from intrusion, and restored to its former condition: and\r\nthe question of title committed to the Legislature, the only\r\nauthority competent to its decision. If they considered the\r\nground taken by the Executive as incorrect, their vote, or their\r\nreference of the case to Commissioners, would correct it: and\r\nas to damages, if any could justly be claimed, they were due, as\r\nin other cases, not from the judge who decides, but the party\r\nwhich, without right, receives the intermediate profits. If, on\r\nthe other hand, Congress should deem the public right too palpable,\r\n(as to me it clearly appears,) and the claim of the plaintiff\r\ntoo frivolous, to occupy their time, they would of course pass it\r\nby. And certainly they might as properly be urged to waste\r\ntheir time in questioning whether the beds of the Potomak, the\r\nDelaware, or the Hudson, were public or private property, as\r\nthat of the Missisipi. Their refusing to act on this claim therefore\r\nfor five successive sessions, though constantly solicited, and\r\ntheir holding so long the ground taken by the Executive, is an\r\nexpression of their sense that the measure has been correct.\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: Responsibility of a public functionary.]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 79*]\r\n\r\n  [Sidenote: 80*]\r\n\r\nI have gone with some detail into the question of the plaintiff's\r\nright, because, however confident of indulgence,\r\nin the case of an honest error, I believed it would be\r\nmore satisfactory to show, that in the exercise of the\r\ndiscretionary power entrusted to me by Congress, a\r\nsound discretion had been used, no act of oppression had been\r\nexercised, no error committed, and consequently no wrong done\r\nto the plaintiff. I have no pretensions to exemption from error.\r\nIn a long course of public duties, I must have committed many.\r\nAnd I have reason to be thankful that, passing over these, an act\r\nof duty has been selected as a subject of complaint, which the\r\ndelusions of self interest alone could have classed among them,\r\nand in which, were there error, it has been hallowed by the\r\nbenedictions of an entire province, an interesting member of our\r\nnational family, threatened with destruction by the bold enterprise\r\nof one individual. If this has been defeated, and they\r\nrescued, good will have been done, and with good intentions.\r\nOur constitution has wisely distributed the administration of the\r\ngovernment into three distinct, and independent departments.\r\nTo each of these it belongs to administer law within its separate\r\njurisdiction. The judiciary in cases of _meum_ and _tuum_, and\r\nof public crimes; the Executive, as to laws executive in their\r\nnature; the legislature in various cases which belong to itself,\r\nand in the important function of amending and adding to the\r\nsystem. Perfection in wisdom, as well as in integrity, is\r\nneither required, nor expected in these *agents. It belongs\r\nnot to man. Were the judge who, deluded by\r\nsophistry, takes the life of an innocent man, to repay it with his\r\nown; were he to replace, with his own fortune, that which his\r\njudgment has taken from another, under the beguilement of false\r\ndeductions; were the Executive, in the vast mass of concerns of\r\nfirst magnitude, which he must direct, to place his whole fortune\r\non the hazard of every opinion; were the members of the legislature\r\nto make good from their private substance every law productive\r\nof public or private injury; in short were every man\r\nengaged in rendering service to the public, bound in his body\r\nand goods to indemnification for all his errors, we must commit\r\nour public affairs to the paupers of the nation, to the sweepings\r\nof hospitals and poor-houses, who, having nothing to lose, would\r\nhave nothing to risk. The wise know their weakness too well\r\nto assume infallibility; and he who knows most, knows best\r\nhow little he knows. The vine and the fig-tree must withdraw,\r\nand the briar and bramble assume their places. But this is not\r\nthe spirit of our law. It expects not impossibilities. It has consecrated\r\nthe principle that its servants are not answerable for\r\nhonest error of judgment. 1. Ro. Abr. 92. 2 Jones 13. 1 Salk.\r\n397. He who has done this duty honestly, and according to his\r\nbest skill and judgment, stands acquitted before God and man.\r\nIf indeed a judge goes against law so grossly, so palpably as no\r\nimputable degree of folly can account for, and nothing but corruption,\r\nmalice or wilful wrong can explain, and especially if\r\ncircumstances prove such motives, he may be punished for the\r\ncorruption, the malice, the wilful wrong; but not for the error:\r\nnor is he liable to action by the party grieved. And our form\r\nof government constituting its respective functionaries judges of\r\nthe law which is to guide their decisions, places all within the\r\nsame reason, under the safeguard of the same rule. That in deciding\r\nand acting under the law in the present case, the plaintiff,\r\nwho may think there was error, does not himself believe there\r\nwas corruption or malice, I am confident. What? was it my\r\nmalice or corruption which prompted the Governors and Cabildoes\r\nto keep these grounds clear of intrusion? Did my malice\r\nand corruption excite the people to rise, and stay the parricide\r\nhand uplifted to destroy their city, or the grand jury to present\r\nthis violator of their laws? Was it my malice and corruption\r\nwhich penned the opinion of the Attorney General, and drew\r\nfrom him a confirmation, after two years of further consideration,\r\nand when I was retired from all public office? Was it my\r\nmalice or corruption which dictated the unanimous advice of the\r\nheads of departments, when officially called on for consultation\r\nand advice? Was it my malice and corruption which procured\r\nthe immediate thanks of the two houses of legislature of the\r\nterritory of Orleans, and a renewal of the same thanks\r\n*for the same interference, in their late vote of February\r\nlast? Has it been my malice and corruption which has\r\ninduced the national legislature, through five successive sessions,\r\nto be deaf to the doleful Jeremiads of the plaintiff on his removal\r\n_from his estate_ at New Orleans? Have all these opinions then\r\nbeen honest, and mine alone malicious and corrupt? Or has\r\nthere been a general combination of all the public functionaries\r\nSpanish, French, and American, to oppress Mr. Livingston? No.\r\nThey have done their duties, and his Declaration is a libel on\r\nall these functionaries. His counsel, indeed, has discovered\r\n[Opinions LXXIV] that we should have had legal inquests taken,\r\nwrits of enquiry formed, prosecutions for penalties, with all the\r\n_et cæteras_ of the law. That is that we should be playing push-pin\r\nwith judges and lawyers, while Livingston was working\r\ndouble tides to drown the city. If a functionary of the highest\r\ntrust, acting under every sanction which the constitution has\r\nprovided for his aid and guide, and with the approbation, expressed\r\nor implied, of its highest councils, still acts on his own\r\nperil, the honors and offices of his country would be but snares\r\nto ruin him. It is not for me to enquire into the motives of the\r\nplaintiff in this action. I know that his understanding is of an\r\norder much too high to let him believe that he is to recover the\r\nvalue of the batture from me. To what indirect object he may\r\nsquint with one eye, while the other looks at me, I do not pretend\r\nto say. But I do say, that if human reason is not mere\r\nillusion, and law a labyrinth without a clue, no error has been\r\ncommitted: and recurring to the tenor of a long life of public\r\nservice, against the charge of malice and corruption I stand conscious\r\nand erect.\r\n\r\n                                                        TH: JEFFERSON.\r\n     MONTICELLO, July 31, 1810.\r\n\r\n     For Mr. Livingston's Answer, see Hall's American Law Journal,\r\n     Vol. 5, p. 113, of the Baltimore edition of 1814.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n    [82] He says, February, 1804.

A law of\r\n         Burgundy provided that 'Si quis post hoc barbarus vel\r\n         testari voluerit, vel donare, aut Romanam consuetudinem,\r\n         aut barbaricam, esse servandam, sciat.' 'If any barbarian\r\n         subject hereafter shall desire to dispose by legacy or\r\n         donation, let him know that either the Roman or barbarian\r\n         law is to be observed.' And one of Lotharius II. of Germany,\r\n         going still further, gives to every one an election of the\r\n         system under which he chose to live. 'Volumus ut cunctus\r\n         populus Romanus interrogatur quali lege vult vivere: ut\r\n         tali lege, quali professi sunt vivere vivant: illisque\r\n         denuntiatur, ut hoc unusquisque, tam judices, quam duces,\r\n         vel reliquus populus sciat, quod si offensionem contra\r\n         eandem legem fecerint, eidem legi, quâ profitentur vivere,\r\n         subjaceant.' 'We will that all the Roman people shall be\r\n         asked by what law they wish to live: that they may live\r\n         under such law as they profess to live by: and that it be\r\n         published, that every one, judges, as well as generals,\r\n         or the rest of the people, may know that if they commit\r\n         offence against the said law, they shall be subject to the\r\n         same law by which they profess to live.'

Thus favored, the Roman became an acknowledged\r\n         supplement to the feudal or customary law: but still, not\r\n         under any act of the legislature, but as 'raison écrite,'\r\n         written reason: and the cases to which it is applicable,\r\n         becoming much the most numerous, it constitutes in fact\r\n         the mass of their law.\r\n\r\n    [90] Since this publication, Gen. Armstrong, our late Minister\r\n         at Paris, has sent me a printed copy of Crozat's Charter in\r\n         French, which he says he obtained directly, and in person\r\n         from the depôt of laws in Paris, but which he had no means\r\n         of comparing with the original. This printed copy, with\r\n         Gen. Armstrong's letter, I have deposited in the office\r\n         of the Secretary of State at Washington. _MS. Note._\r\n\r\n    [91] The only copy of this Charter I have ever met with is in\r\n         Joutel's Journal of La Salle's last voyage. An application\r\n         was made by the government of the United States, through\r\n         their minister at Paris, to the government of France, for\r\n         permission to have the original of this charter sought\r\n         for in their Archives, and an authentic copy obtained. The\r\n         application was unsuccessful. We must resort, therefore,\r\n         to this publication, made in 1714, two years after the\r\n         date of the patent, under the rule of law which requires\r\n         only the best evidence the nature of the case will admit.\r\n         For although we may not appeal to books of history for\r\n         documents of a nature merely private, yet we may for those\r\n         of a public character, e. g. treaties, &c., and especially\r\n         when those documents are not under our control, as when\r\n         they are in foreign countries, or even in our own country,\r\n         when they are not patent in their nature, nor demandable\r\n         of common right.\r\n\r\n    [92] If it be objected that the incorporation of the Roman law\r\n         with the customs of Paris, and their joint transfer to\r\n         Louisiana does not appear, I answer, 1. At the date of\r\n         Crozat's charter, the Roman law had for many centuries\r\n         been amalgamated with the customary law of Paris, made\r\n         one body with it, and its principal part. By the customs\r\n         of Paris were doubtless meant the laws of Paris, of which\r\n         the Roman then made an important part, and might well be\r\n         understood to be transferred with them. It was hardly\r\n         intended that the new colonists were to unravel this\r\n         web, and to take out for their own use only the fibres of\r\n         Parisian customs, the least applicable part of the system\r\n         to their novel situation. 2. If the term, coutumes de Paris\r\n         in the charter be rigorously restrained to its literal\r\n         import, yet the judges of Louisiana would have the same\r\n         authority for appealing to the Roman as a supplementary\r\n         code, which the judges of Paris and of all France had had;\r\n         and even greater, as being sanctioned by so general an\r\n         example. 3. The practice of considering the Roman law as\r\n         a part of the law of the land in Louisiana, is evidence\r\n         of a general opinion of those who composed that state,\r\n         that it was transferred, and of an opinion much better\r\n         informed, and more authoritative than ours can be. Or it\r\n         may be considered as an adoption, by universal, though\r\n         tacit consent, of those who had a right to adopt, either\r\n         formally, or informally, as they pleased, as the laws of\r\n         England were originally adopted in most of these states,\r\n         and still stand on no other ground.\r\n\r\n    [93] M. Moreau de Lislet assures us that he was in Paris at\r\n         the time of the decision of this appeal from Bordeaux,\r\n         that the decision of Bordeaux was reversed by the king\r\n         and council, then referred to the Parliament of Paris, and\r\n         the reversal confirmed by that body. See his Memoire, 50.\r\n\r\n    [94] 'Rivage, is most commonly used for the shore of the _sea_,\r\n         but correctly also for the shore of a river.\r\n\r\n                  'Chaque fleuve, chaque ruisseau\r\n                  A partout franchi son rivage.'

But I have lately had an opportunity\r\n         of reading in MS. a Memoire on the subject of the Batture,\r\n         written by M. Moreau de Lislet of New Orleans, a French\r\n         lawyer of regular education in the profession, who has\r\n         treated the subject, generally with great learning and\r\n         abilities, and especially that branch of it which relates\r\n         to the laws of France in cases of Alluvion. He has proved\r\n         that the doctrines of these great authorities are not\r\n         contradictory, and that a proper attention to the different\r\n         questions under contemplation in the passages quoted, will\r\n         show that all are right, and all in perfect harmony. To\r\n         elucidate this he explains certain principles of French\r\n         law, which mingling themselves with this subject, have\r\n         occasioned the misunderstanding with which we have been\r\n         perplexed. 1. The laws of France leave to the king a\r\n         right to _navigable_ rivers only, and their increments.\r\n         On rivers _not navigable_, the rights of the riparian\r\n         proprietor prevail as under the Roman law. See Pothier\r\n         ante. pa. 26. Very early however these rights were drawn\r\n         into question by the Feudal Superiors, who, looking to\r\n         the example of the king in the case of navigable rivers\r\n         in his kingdom, claimed similar rights on those _not\r\n         navigable_ within their Seignories. But repeated decisions\r\n         have condemned their claims, and confirmed the rights\r\n         of the riparian tenant. 2. By the laws of France, as by\r\n         those of England, lands received by inheritance, descend,\r\n         on the death of the tenant, to the heirs of that branch,\r\n         paternal or maternal, from which they came to him. But\r\n         those he acquires by purchase (acquets) pass to that line\r\n         of heirs of which himself is the root. When therefore,\r\n         to a maternal inheritance an acquisition happened to\r\n         be made by means of Alluvion, a question would arise,\r\n         between heirs of different lines, to which of them the\r\n         Alluvion would descend; whether to the direct heirs of the\r\n         decedent, as being an acquisition first vesting in him, or\r\n         to the maternal heir as an accessory to his inheritance.\r\n         The decisions were that it united with the inheritance,\r\n         became a part of that, and passed with it. 'Incrementum\r\n         alluvionis nobis adquiritur, jure quo ager augmentatus\r\n         primum ad nos pertinebat; nec istud merementum censetur\r\n         novus ager sed pars primi.' 'The increment of Alluvion is\r\n         acquired to us in the right in which the field augmented\r\n         first belonged to us.' Nor is the increment considered as\r\n         a new field, but a part of the first, Renusson. It follows\r\n         that questions of Alluvion would often arise in cases\r\n         wherein the king's rights were not at all concerned. They\r\n         would arise between Lord and vassal, and between individual\r\n         heirs of different lines. These explanations premised, M.\r\n         Moreau takes a review of the passages quoted from Henrys,\r\n         Bourjon, Dumoulin, Ferriere, Pothier, Le Rasle, Renusson,\r\n         Dargentré, Denisart, and Guyot, and shews that in every\r\n         instance where the question concerned a _navigable_ river,\r\n         there was no division of opinions as to the validity of\r\n         the king's right; and that in every instance where the\r\n         riparian right is asserted, the question has been between\r\n         private individuals, or concerning rivers _not navigable_.\r\n         Recurring then to the edicts and Ordinances placing this\r\n         right of the king beyond cavil, he observes that a practice\r\n         had prevailed from early times among riparian proprietors\r\n         of usurping on the rights of the crown to the increments\r\n         adjacent to them, and a necessary reaction of the crown,\r\n         by reclamations and resumptions, to preserve its own. And\r\n         he gives a detail of the edicts on this subject, proving\r\n         that that of 1693, instead of being the singular act\r\n         of a particular prince, whom the adverse party delights\r\n         to revile, was one only of a long series preceding and\r\n         following it.\r\n\r\n         1554. An edict was issued requiring the proper officers to\r\n         be vigilant in watching over the king's rights in islands,\r\n         attérissements, et _alluvions_, comme ils l'ont accoutumés\r\n         faire d'ancienneté.' So that it was even then a law and\r\n         practice d'ancienneté, and expressly including _alluvions_.\r\n\r\n         1664. An Ordinance for making enquiries concerning islands,\r\n         accroissements, &c.\r\n\r\n         1668. Apr. An Edict quieting possessions of these objects\r\n         of 100 years continuance, on paying a vingtiéme annually.\r\n\r\n         1669. The Ordinance des eaux et forêts, 'qui accorde au\r\n         roi la propriété de toutes _les rivières navigables_, de\r\n         leur lit, _rives_, et de tous les terreins qui peuvents\r\n         s'y former.' Guyot, ante. pa. 27. 'granting to the king\r\n         the property in _all navigable rivers_, their bed, _banks_,\r\n         and the grounds forming there.'\r\n\r\n         1683. Apr. A declaration, reciting that as the rivers\r\n         belong to the king 'tout ce qui se trouve renfermé dans\r\n         leur lit, comme les isles, accroissemens et attérissements\r\n         lui appartient aussi,' confirms _title_ anterior to\r\n         1566 without condition, possessions anterior to 1566 on\r\n         conditions, and reunites all others to the crown.\r\n\r\n         1686. Apr.} Two edicts for Languedoc and Bretagne,\r\n         1689. Aug.} confirming possessors in the said islands,\r\n         'ensemble des crémens qui s'y sont formés, et de ceux\r\n         qui pourraient s'y former à l'avenir, soit par _alluvion_,\r\n         ou par industrie.'\r\n\r\n         1693. An edict general for the kingdom 'le droit de\r\n         propriété que nous avons _sur tous les fleuves et rivières\r\n         navigables_ étant incontestable, &c. Ordonnons que les\r\n         détenteurs des isles, islots, attérissemens, aceroissemens,\r\n         alluvions, &c. _sur_ les _rivières navigables_, &c. as\r\n         more at large, pa. 28.\r\n\r\n         1710. Feb. An edict confirming possession of islands, &c.\r\n         of the sea on specified terms, copied almost verbally from\r\n         that of 1693, using the word _alluvions_ as that does,\r\n         and referring to the provisions of that edict.\r\n\r\n         1722. Sep. An Arret resuming isles, attérissemens, &c.\r\n         formed since the edict of 1693. And those of anterior\r\n         formation where the possessor has not made the payments\r\n         provided by the edict of 1693.\r\n\r\n         But this whole branch of the argument of M. Moreau must\r\n         be read with attention. Its matter cannot be abridged,\r\n         nor otherwise expressed, but for the worse.\r\n\r\n         Having thus luminously reconciled the authorities which\r\n         had been so illy understood, and victoriously established\r\n         the public right to alluvions on _navigable rivers_, M.\r\n         Moreau, with too much facility, gives back to his adversary\r\n         one half the ground he has conquered, by a gratuitous\r\n         admission, which those interested in the event of the\r\n         cause are not ready to confirm. Led away, as it seems,\r\n         by an expression in the edict of 1683, 'tout ce qui se\r\n         trouve renfermé _dans leur lit_ nous appartient,' and\r\n         which is to be found in no other, and yielding to a single\r\n         decision of the Parliament of Paris of 1765, found in a\r\n         law dictionary, which adjudged that the Ordinances giving\r\n         to the king the isles which are formed _'dans le lit_,'\r\n         des fleuves et rivières navigables, ne lui donnent pas les\r\n         attérissements et _alluvions_ qui peuvent se former _hors_\r\n         le lit de ces mêmes fleuves,' &c. He admits that though\r\n         alluvions _within_ the bed of a river belong to the king,\r\n         those _without_ the bed do not belong to him. M. Moreau\r\n         is too reasonable to consider as a compliment to himself\r\n         the adoption of an opinion on his authority alone, by\r\n         any one not convinced by his reasonings. Certainly I do\r\n         not feel myself competent to enter the lists with him, on\r\n         any question of difficulty in the French law. Yet after\r\n         maturely considering the authorities appealed to in this\r\n         case, and which he has rendered so strong by reconciling\r\n         and forming them into one mass, I cannot yield, as he\r\n         does, so imposing a mass to a single decision of the single\r\n         Parliament of Paris. I still must consider all alluvions\r\n         on _navigable rivers_ as belonging to the nation, and will\r\n         briefly assign my reasons.\r\n\r\n         1. It is of the essence of _Alluvion_ that it be, not in the\r\n         bed of the river, but _out_ of it; that is, adjacent to the\r\n         bank. So say expressly the Roman and French definitions.\r\n         'Alluvio est incrementum _agro_ tuo flumine adjectum.'\r\n         l'Alluvion est un accroissement de terrein qui se fait\r\n         _sur les bords_ des fleuves, par les terres que l'eau y\r\n         apporte, et qui se consolident pour ne faire _qu'un tout\r\n         avec la terre voisine_.' Ante. pa. 26. Increments _within_\r\n         the bed of a river, though sometimes carelessly spoken of\r\n         under the term _alluvion_, are never so in correct language,\r\n         never in the well weighed diction of ordinances and\r\n         statutes. They are termed accroissements, attérissements,\r\n         assablissements, isles, islots, javeaux, in French, and\r\n         in our language shoals, shallows, flats, bars, islands.\r\n         _Without_ the bed of the river, they add to the beach, or\r\n         to the adjacent field, according to their elevation, and\r\n         in this last case only, constitute _Alluvion, within_ the\r\n         bed of the river they lose that name.\r\n\r\n         2. 'Les alluvions qui se forment _dans_ le lit des fleuves'\r\n         is not the language of the edicts cited by Moreau himself,\r\n         not even of that single one on which this opinion is\r\n         founded. That has indeed the expression 'dans les lits,' but\r\n         applied, not to alluvions, but to isles, accroissements,\r\n         attérissements, to which it is applicable with truth\r\n         and correctness. These are the kinds of increments it\r\n         enumerates, and describes as being 'dans le lit.' If they\r\n         are enumerated _exempli gratiâ_ only as the word _comme_ seems\r\n         to imply, and alluvions, though not named, were within the\r\n         purview, as they are within the reason of the law, then,\r\n         if the thing itself is to be understood, as if expressed\r\n         in the text, its true description also is to be understood\r\n         as if expressed, that is to say, its adjacence to the\r\n         bank. The edicts of 1686 and 1689 mention 'les isles des\r\n         rivières navigables, ensemble les crémens qui _s'y_ sont\r\n         formés.' That of 1693 says, in like manner, 'le droit,\r\n         &c., _sur_ tout les fleuves, et les isles et crémens qui\r\n         _s'y_ sont formes,' and again, 'isles et alluvions _sur_\r\n         les rivières navigables,' not '_dans leurs lits_.' That of\r\n         1710 says 'possession des isles et _alluvion sur_ les dites\r\n         rivières.' Thus we see that wherever the edicts mention\r\n         _alluvions_, they describe them _sur_ le fleuve, not _dans\r\n         le lit_ du fleuve. When they speak of those increments\r\n         which are _dans le lit_ des fleuves, they name them as\r\n         accroissemens, attérissemens, &c., but not as _alluvions_.\r\n\r\n         3. This distinction is founded on a single decision of\r\n         a single parliament, and on the authority of a king's\r\n         advocate, Bacquet, and the dictum of Salvaing there cited,\r\n         all perhaps influenced by the same and single expression\r\n         in the edict of 1683. It is cited too from a Dictionary by\r\n         Prost de Royer, where it is doubtless stated in abridgment\r\n         only, and possibly with the omission of circumstances,\r\n         arguments, and expressions which, were they before us,\r\n         would change the aspect of the case, as M. Moreau himself\r\n         has shown to be so possible in his review of the mutilated\r\n         authorities produced by the adversary. And are we, for\r\n         this, to give up the doctrines of Pothier, Denisart,\r\n         Ferriere, and the host of other great authorities, and all\r\n         the definitions of the Roman and French laws, all of which\r\n         when speaking of _alluvions_, place them exclusively on\r\n         the borders, and not in the beds of rivers? I cannot do it.\r\n\r\n         4. This distinction is new in this cause, having never\r\n         been claimed by the plaintiff or his counsel, or suggested\r\n         by any other who has treated the question. This naturally\r\n         begets a suspicion that it is peculiar; though doubtless\r\n         the adversary will adopt it with avidity. And is he\r\n         entitled to this gratuitous aid? Is it the equity of his\r\n         cause, or even its honesty, or its utility, which gives\r\n         him this claim on our tenderness? I cannot consent to a\r\n         concession which gives the Batture from the public in the\r\n         contingency of its being considered as a real alluvion,\r\n         consolidated with, and making part of, the adjacent field.\r\n         On the contrary I insist on the public right in this case\r\n         also, under the laws of France, as hitherto understood,\r\n         and as declared by her highest authorities.\r\n\r\n         5. I adhere to this ground the more firmly, because I\r\n         observe, from another part of his Memoire, pa. 99. that\r\n         M. Moreau himself seems not very decided in this new\r\n         opinion. After stating the mischief of Mr. Livingston's\r\n         works, he says, 'it is to prevent a like abuse that the\r\n         Roman and Spanish laws of haute police, which I have\r\n         cited, are opposed to every species of works undertaken\r\n         on the banks of rivers and navigable streams, the effect\r\n         of which might be to extend the limits of riparian fields,\r\n         compromising the public safety, and injuring the facility\r\n         of navigation. It was with this view, and not to create\r\n         fiscal resources for himself that Louis XIV. renewed the\r\n         Ordinances which ascribed to the sovereign the property in\r\n         rivers and navigable streams, and of whatever is contained\r\n         in their bed. For if it be advantageous to navigation that\r\n         the king should be proprietor of the islands which form\r\n         themselves in navigable rivers, the same interest requires\r\n         still more that he should be proprietor of the _alluvions_\r\n         and increments formed _along the shore itself_, since any\r\n         ownership of these objects, except that of the sovereign,\r\n         might oppose obstacles to the free landing on the shore,\r\n         which every one ought to have, and to the use of it which\r\n         the law gives to the public.'\r\n\r\n         Considering this admission then, as doubted by M. Moreau\r\n         himself on a second and sounder view of it, I conclude\r\n         that the law is accurately laid down by Pothier [ante. pa.\r\n         26.] 'By our French law, alluvions formed on the borders\r\n         of _navigable_ streams and rivers belong to the king. The\r\n         proprietors of riparian heritages can have no claim to\r\n         them, unless they have documents of the grant made them by\r\n         the king, of the right of alluvion along their heritages.\r\n         With respect to alluvions formed along the borders of a\r\n         river _not navigable_, the property of which belongs to the\r\n         proprietors of the neighboring heritage, the dispositions\r\n         of the Roman law are to be followed.'\r\n\r\n    [96] Since this was written, I have seen the case of Smart v.\r\n         the magistrates, town council and community of Dundee,\r\n         reported in 8 Brown's Reports of Appeals in parl. 119. This\r\n         was an appeal from the court of Session in Scotland, to\r\n         the H. of Lords. The crown of Scotland had in very ancient\r\n         times, granted to the Corporation of Dundee, on the river\r\n         Tay, the borough, with all the lands and pertinents, the\r\n         privileges, profits, customs, ports, and liberties of\r\n         the river on both sides, as freely in all respects as is\r\n         possessed by the borough of Edinburgh over that of Leith,\r\n         and in a word, as it seems, every right, power and trust\r\n         which the crown could grant.--Smart, the proprietor of a\r\n         lot bounded on one side per fluxum maris, or the sea flood,\r\n         admitting that the sovereign, as trustee for the public,\r\n         has a right to prevent all such appropriation of the sea\r\n         shore, or the banks of navigable rivers as would impede\r\n         navigation, render it dangerous or hurt the interests of\r\n         commerce, either inland or foreign, and that all private\r\n         persons or corporations, having a grant of a port and\r\n         harbor, possess, to a certain extent, the same privileges\r\n         as derived from the sovereign within a defined space,\r\n         still he insisted on the right of the adjacent proprietor\r\n         to ground gained from the sea by its recess, or by his own\r\n         industry in embanking, or by any other opus manu factum,\r\n         _not prejudicial to navigation or the established rights\r\n         of others_. On the other hand the corporation claimed\r\n         by their grant, a right to the seashore adjacent to the\r\n         town, _in trust for the benefit of the community_, to\r\n         make harbors, basons, and works for securing them, market\r\n         places, wharves, wood yards, and other repositories for the\r\n         accommodation of the trade, and, for these different works,\r\n         to take in scites from the water by embankment, in short,\r\n         as standing in place of the crown, that they succeeded to\r\n         all the cares and powers of the crown, in the territory\r\n         and its waters, for the public good; and, for that object,\r\n         were now engaged in making an embankment adjacent to the\r\n         Appellant's lot, for the benefit of navigation and commerce.\r\n         They admit the general doctrine of the riparian right to\r\n         the soil which may be acquired from a sea or river, by its\r\n         receding naturally, or by industry: but that this does not\r\n         apply to the site of a _tenement within a burgh_, where\r\n         the corporation is entitled to all the soil not expressly\r\n         granted away: that the words, 'per fluxum maris' are but\r\n         words of description, which were accurate too at the date\r\n         of the grant, but have since become otherwise by a change\r\n         of character in the boundary, not in the area granted. They\r\n         are a limitation of the subject of the grant in the same way\r\n         as a road would be, which, if removed farther off, would\r\n         not carry the granted subject with it; or as the tenement\r\n         of another would be; and make it an _ager limitatus_, not an\r\n         _ager arcifinius_; the particular boundaries being named,\r\n         not to limit the coterminous property, but the property\r\n         granted. The Appeal was accordingly dismissed by the House\r\n         of Lords. No arguments of counsel, other than the written\r\n         pleadings, nor reasons of the Lords, are reported: but,\r\n         from this case, (crowded as it is with circumstances, many\r\n         of which are irrelevant to the merits of the question,\r\n         and of those relevant not the words but the condensed\r\n         substance is here given,) the book says, that the general\r\n         principle to be gathered is that 'where the sea flood is\r\n         stated as the boundary of premises granted on the shore of\r\n         _a sea-port being an incorporated borough_, this does not\r\n         give the grantee a right to follow the sea, or to the land\r\n         acquired from it, or left by it where it has receded, in\r\n         prejudice of the _corporation_ having, by their charter,\r\n         a right vested in them to the whole territory of the\r\n         burgh.' And consequently, in prejudice of the _king_, or\r\n         _public_, where no such grant has substituted others in\r\n         their place: and it authorizes a strong inference that\r\n         the English, like the Roman law, restrains the right of\r\n         alluvion to the _prædium rusticum__$1_, not admitting it on the\r\n         shores bordering the city.\r\n\r\n    [97] Etymologies often help us to the true meaning of words;\r\n         and where they agree in several languages, they shew the\r\n         common sense of mankind as to the meaning of the word. In\r\n         French _Batture_ is derived from _Battre_, to beat, being\r\n         the margin on which the surges beat. In English _Beach_, is\r\n         from the Anglo-Saxon verb Beo[~c]ian, Bea[~c]ian, beatian,\r\n         to beat: pronounced beachian, as christian, fustian,\r\n         question, are pronounced chrischian, fuschian, queschion,\r\n         &c.\r\n\r\n         In Spanish _Playa_,   }\r\n            Italian _Piaggia_, } are from πλαγὰ, πληγεὶς.\r\n            French  _Plage_,   }\r\n                    _Platin_ from πλήττειν, percuture. Perhaps from\r\n                    _Plat_, F. flat.\r\n            Greek, αἰγειαλὸς, ἀκτὴ, from ἄγειν, agere.\r\n                   θὶν, θινὸς, à θείνω, ferio, quia littus fluctibus\r\n                     feritur.

Plin. hist. nat. 5. 9.\r\n\r\n    [100] This part of our subject merits fuller development.\r\n         That the periodical overflowings of some rivers do not\r\n         differ from the accidental overflowings of others, in\r\n         any circumstance which should affect the law of the high\r\n         water line, in the one more than in the other, will be\r\n         rendered more evident by taking a comparative view of them.\r\n         To begin with ordinary rivers. 1. These have along their\r\n         greater part, and some of them through their whole course,\r\n         natural banks adequate to the confinement of their waters,\r\n         in the high water season, except in cases of accidental\r\n         inundation. Here, then, the Roman authorities tell us the\r\n         inundation does not change the bank, nor the landmark on\r\n         it. 2. Along other parts, where the natural bank was not\r\n         high enough to contain the river in its season of steady\r\n         high water, the hand of man has raised an artificial bank\r\n         on the natural one, which effects this purpose, with the\r\n         exception, as before, of accidental inundations, where such\r\n         happen. This artificial bank performs all the functions\r\n         of the natural, and is placed under the same law. 3.\r\n         In other parts of them, the natural banks are still not\r\n         high enough to contain the high tides, nor have they yet\r\n         been made so by the hand of man. Here then the law cannot\r\n         operate, because the local peculiarities, as yet, exclude\r\n         the case from its provisions. The ground so covered by\r\n         inundation, has been, or may yet be, public property. But\r\n         the legislator, instead of holding it as the bed of the\r\n         river, grants it to individuals as far as to the natural\r\n         or incipient bank, that they, by completing the bank, may\r\n         reclaim the land, for their own and the public benefit,\r\n         and, this done, the law comes into action on it. Much of\r\n         this reclaimed, and unreclaimed land exists in all these\r\n         states.\r\n\r\n         I proceed next to rivers of particular character. Of which\r\n         among those analogous to the Missisipi, the Nile is best\r\n         known to us, and shall be described. That river entering\r\n         Upper Egypt at its Cataracts, flows through a valley of\r\n         20 or 30 miles wide, and of 450 miles in length, bounded\r\n         on both sides by a continued ridge of mountains. Through\r\n         most of this course, its natural banks are sufficient to\r\n         contain its waters in time of flood, till they rise to that\r\n         height, at which, by their law, they are to be drawn off.\r\n         In low parts, where the natural banks are not sufficient,\r\n         they have been raised by hand to the necessary height. In\r\n         addition also to the natural _bayous_, like those of the\r\n         Missisipi, they have opened numerous canals, leading off\r\n         at right angles from the river towards the mountains, and\r\n         sufficient to draw off the greatest part of the current\r\n         passing down the river. These, in ordinary times, are\r\n         closed by artificial banks raised to the level of the\r\n         natural ones. When the flood is at a height sufficient\r\n         for irrigating and fertilizing the fields, which by the\r\n         Nilometer is at 16 cubits above the bed of the river,\r\n         these artificial banks are cut, and the waters let in. The\r\n         plain declining gently from the banks of the river, (which,\r\n         like those of the Missisipi, are the highest ground,)\r\n         towards the mountains, the waters are there stopped, as\r\n         by a dam, and continue to rise, and diffuse themselves\r\n         till they reflow nearly to the bank of the river. If\r\n         the rise ceases there, the waters remain stagnant, and\r\n         deposit a fertilizing mud, over the whole surface. But if\r\n         uncommon rains above occasion a continuance of the rise\r\n         till all the waters meet over the summits of the banks,\r\n         then the motion of that in the river is communicated to\r\n         the stagnant water on the plains, a general current takes\r\n         place, and instead of a depositum left, the former soil\r\n         is swept away to the ocean, and famine ensues that year.\r\n         This, the traveller Bruce informs us, had happened three\r\n         times within the 30 years preceding his being in that\r\n         country. When the waters have withdrawn, and the river is\r\n         returned into its natural bed, the banks are repaired in\r\n         readiness to restrain the floods of the ensuing year. Such\r\n         is the case in Upper Egypt. When the river enters Lower\r\n         Egypt, it parts into two principal branches, the Pelusian\r\n         and Canopic, which diverge and reach the Mediterranean at\r\n         about 200 miles apart, including between them the triangle\r\n         called the Delta. Besides these, there are, within the\r\n         Delta, three natural _Bayous_, and two canals, dry at low\r\n         water, which make up the famed seven mouths of the Nile.\r\n         The mountains diverge so as do the main branches of the\r\n         river, the eastern going off to the isthmus of Suez, and\r\n         the Western to the sea near Alexandria. The waters lessened\r\n         by depletion, and spreading over a widening plain are\r\n         reduced, by the time they reach the base of the triangle\r\n         at the sea, to one or two cubits depth. Banks, therefore,\r\n         of 3 to 4 feet high, are sufficient to protect the country\r\n         until here also they open the _bayous_ and canals which\r\n         intersect the triangle. Here then the case recurs of a\r\n         river whose natural banks are partly competent to contain\r\n         its high waters in common floods, and are partly made so\r\n         by the hand of man; so as to furnish an ordinary high\r\n         water line. In extraordinary floods it overflows these\r\n         banks, and in ordinary ones is let through them. Yet these\r\n         inundations as the Digest declares, do not change the\r\n         banks. 'Nemo dixit Nilum ripas suas mutare,' &c. But when\r\n         the river retires within its natural bed, the banks are\r\n         again repaired: 'cum ad perpetuam sui mensuram redierit,\r\n         ripæ alvei ejus muniendæ sunt,' ib. [See 2. Herodot. 6-19.\r\n         Strabo 788. 1 Univ. Hist. 391-413. 1 Maillet Description\r\n         de l'Egypte 14-121. 1 De la Croix 338. Encyclop. Meth.\r\n         Geographie.
