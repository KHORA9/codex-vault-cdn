ROYCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn historical atlas of Indian affairs has for some time past been in\r\ncourse of preparation under the direction of the Bureau of Ethnology,\r\nSmithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nThe chief aim of this atlas is to show upon a series of State and\r\nTerritorial maps the boundaries of the various tracts of country which\r\nhave from time to time been acquired through the medium of treaty\r\nstipulation or act of Congress from the several Indian tribes resident\r\nwithin the present territory of the United States from the beginning of\r\nthe Federal period to the present day.\r\n\r\nAccompanying this atlas will be one or more volumes of historical\r\ntext, wherein will be given with some detail a history of the official\r\nrelations between the United States and these tribes. This will treat\r\nof the various negotiations for peace and for the acquisition of\r\nterritory, the causes rendering such negotiations necessary, and the\r\nmethods observed by the Government through its authorized agents in\r\nthis diplomacy, as well as other matters of public concern growing out\r\nof the same.\r\n\r\nThe following monograph on the history of the Cherokees, with its\r\naccompanying maps, is given as an illustration of the character of the\r\nwork in its treatment of each of the Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nThe maps are intended to show not only the ancestral but the present\r\nhome of the Cherokees, and also to indicate the boundaries of the\r\nvarious tracts of territory purchased from them by the Colonial or\r\nFederal authorities from time to time since their first contact with\r\nthe European settlements. A number of purchases made prior to the\r\nFederal period by individuals were unauthorized and unrecognized by the\r\nColonial authorities, and their boundaries, though given in the text,\r\nare not laid down upon the map, because the same areas of territory\r\nwere afterwards included within the limits of Colonial purchases.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this article, more particularly in the tracing\r\nout of the various boundary lines, much careful attention and research\r\nhave been given to all available authorities or sources of information.\r\nThe old manuscript records of the Government, the shelves of the\r\nCongressional Library, including its very large collection of American\r\nmaps, local records, and the knowledge of \"old settlers,\" as well as\r\nthe accretions of various State historical societies, have been made to\r\npay tribute to the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the course of these researches the writer has been met in his\r\ninquiries with a degree of courtesy and kindly assistance that merits\r\npublic recognition.\r\n\r\nAmong others who have shown an earnest desire to promote the object\r\nof these investigations are Hon. John M. Lea, vice-president State\r\nHistorical Society of Tennessee; General Robert N. Hood, Spencer\r\nMunson, and R. H. Armstrong, of Knoxville, Tenn. The writer is also\r\ndeeply indebted to the Hon. Hiram Price, Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs, and E. L. Stevens, chief clerk, for the readiness with which\r\nthey afforded him access to the records and files of the Indian\r\nBureau. This permission was earnestly supplemented by the intelligent\r\nassistance and encouragement of Mr. C. A. Maxwell, chief of the Land\r\nDivision, as well as that of R. F. Thompson and Paul Brodie, of the\r\nsame Bureau, both of whom have taken special and constant pains to aid\r\nthese researches.\r\n\r\nTo Captain Adams, of the Bureau of Topographical Engineers, the hearty\r\nthanks of the writer are due for many courtesies extended in the\r\nexamination of the voluminous and valuable collection of maps belonging\r\nto that branch of the public service, and equal credit must be given to\r\nMr. G. P. Strum, principal draughtsman of the General Land Office, and\r\nhis assistants, for their uniform courtesy in affording access to the\r\nofficial plats and records of that Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Congressional Library have also shown a marked\r\ndegree of courtesy and interest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe various cessions of land by the Cherokees alluded

From this narrative it appears that after\r\ntraveling a long distance in a northeasterly direction from his point\r\nof landing on the west coast of Florida, De Soto reached, in the spring\r\nof 1540, an Indian town called by the narrator \"Cutifachiqui.\" From the\r\nearly American maps of De L'Isle and others, upon which is delineated\r\nthe supposed route of De Soto, this town appears to be located on the\r\nSantee River, and, as alleged by the \"gentleman of Elvas,\" on the\r\nauthority of the inhabitants, was two days' journey from the sea-coast.\r\n\r\nThe expedition left Cutifachiqui on the 3d of May, 1540, and pursued\r\na northward course for the period of seven days, when it came to a\r\nprovince called Chelaque, \"the poorest country of maize that was seen\r\nin Florida.\" It is recorded that the Indians of this province \"feed\r\nupon roots and herbs, which they seek in the fields, and upon wild\r\nbeasts, which they kill with their bows and arrows, and are a very\r\ngentle people. All of them go naked and are very lean.\"\r\n\r\nThat this word \"Chalaque\" is identical with our modern Cherokee would\r\nappear to be almost an assured fact. The distance and route pursued\r\nby the expedition are both strongly corroborative of this assumption.\r\nThe orthography of the name was probably taken by the Spaniards from\r\nthe Muscogee pronunciation, heard by them among the Creeks, Choctaws,\r\nand Chickasaws. It is asserted by William Bartram, in his travels\r\nthrough that region in the eighteenth century, that in the \"Muscogulge\"\r\nlanguage the letter \"r\" is not sounded in a single word, but that on\r\nthe contrary it occurs very frequently in the Cherokee tongue.[3]\r\n\r\nThrough this province of Chalaque De Soto passed, still pursuing\r\nhis northward course for five days until he reached the province of\r\n\"Xualla,\" a name much resembling the modern Cherokee word Qualla. The\r\nroute from Cutifachiqui to Xualla lay, for the most part, through a\r\nhilly country. From the latter province the expedition changed its\r\ncourse to the west, trending a little to the south, and over \"very\r\nrough and high hills,\" reaching at the end of five days a town or\r\nprovince which was called \"Guaxule,\" and two days later a town called\r\n\"Canasagua,\" an orthography almost identical with the modern Cherokee\r\nname of Canasauga, as applied to both a stream and a town within their\r\nGeorgia limits.\r\n\r\nAssuming that these people, whose territory De Soto thus traversed,\r\nwere the ancestors of the modern Cherokees, it is the first mention\r\nmade of them by European discoverers and more than a century anterior\r\nto the period when they first became known to the pioneers of permanent\r\nEuropean occupation and settlement.\r\n\r\n_Earliest map._--The earliest map upon which I have found \"Chalaqua\"\r\nlocated is that of \"Florida et Apalche\" by Cornely Wytfliet, published\r\nin 1597.[4] This location is based upon the narrative of De Soto's\r\nexpedition, and is fixed a short distance east of the Savannah River\r\nand immediately south of the Appalachian Mountains. \"Xualla\" is placed\r\nto the west of and near the headwaters of the \"Secco\" or Savannah River.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY TRADITIONS.\r\n\r\nHaywood, in his Natural and Aboriginal History of Tennessee, records\r\nmany of the traditions concerning the origin and the primal habitat of\r\nthe Cherokees. He notes the fact that they were firmly established on\r\nthe Tennessee or Hogohege River before the year 1650, and exercised\r\ndominion over all the country on the east side of the Alleghany\r\nMountains, including the headwaters of the Yadkin, Catawba, Broad, and\r\nSavannah Rivers, and that from thence westward they claimed the country\r\nas far as the Ohio, and thence to the headwaters of the Chattahoochee\r\nand Alabama. One tradition which he alleges existed among them asserts\r\ntheir migration from the west to the upper waters of the Ohio, where\r\nthey erected the mounds on Grave Creek, gradually working eastward\r\nacross the Alleghany Mountains to the neighborhood of Monticello, Va.,\r\nand along the Appomattox River.\r\n\r\nFrom this point, it is alleged, they removed to the Tennessee country\r\nabout 1623, when the Virginians suddenly and unexpectedly fell upon\r\nand massacred the Indians throughout the colony. After this massacre,\r\nthe story goes, they came to New River and made a temporary settlement\r\nthere as well as one on the head of the Holston; but, owing to the\r\nenmity of the northern Indians, they removed in a short time to the\r\nLittle Tennessee and founded what were known as \"Middle Settlements.\"\r\nAnother tribe, he alleges, came from the neighborhood of Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina, and settled lower down the Tennessee. This branch\r\ncalled themselves \"Ketawanga,\" and came last into the country. The\r\ntradition as to those who came from Virginia seeks also to establish\r\nthe idea that the Powhatan Indians were Cherokees. The whole story is\r\nof the vaguest character, and if the remainder has no stronger claims\r\nto credibility than their alleged identity with the Powhatans, it is\r\nscarcely worthy of record except as a matter of curiosity.\r\n\r\nIn fact the explorations of De Soto leave almost convincing proof that\r\nthe Cherokees were occupying a large proportion of their more modern\r\nterritory nearly a century prior to their supposed removal from the\r\nAppomattox.\r\n\r\nPickett, in his History of Alabama, improves upon the legend of Haywood\r\nby asserting as a well established fact what the latter only presumes\r\nto offer as a tradition.\r\n\r\nHowever, as affording a possible confirmation of the legend related by\r\nHaywood concerning their early location in Eastern Virginia, it may\r\nbe worth while to allude to a tradition preserved among the Mohican or\r\nStockbridge tribe. It appears that in 1818 the Delawares, who were then\r\nresiding on White River, in Indiana, ceded their claim to lands in that\r\nregion to the United States. This land had been conditionally given by\r\nthe Miamis many years before to the Delawares, in conjunction with the\r\n\"Moheokunnuks\" (or Stockbridges) and Munsees. Many of the latter two\r\ntribes or bands, including a remnant of the Nanticokes, had not yet\r\nremoved to their western possessions, though they were preparing to\r\nremove. When they ascertained that the Delawares had ceded the lands to\r\nthe United States without their consent, they objected and sought to\r\nhave the cession annulled.\r\n\r\nIn connection with a petition presented to Congress by them on the\r\nsubject in the year 1819, they set forth in detail the tradition\r\nalluded to. The story had been handed down to them from their ancestors\r\nthat \"many thousand moons ago\" before the white men came over the\r\n\"great water,\" the Delawares dwelt along the banks of the river that\r\nbears their name. They had enjoyed a long era of peace and prosperity\r\nwhen the Cherokees, Nanticokes, and some other nation whose name had\r\nbeen forgotten, envying their condition, came from the south with a\r\ngreat army and made war upon them. They vanquished the Delawares and\r\ndrove them to an island in the river. The latter sent for assistance to\r\nthe Mohicans, who promptly came to their relief, and the invaders were\r\nin turn defeated with great slaughter and put to flight. They sued for\r\npeace, and it was granted on condition that they should return home and\r\nnever again make war on the Delawares or their allies. These terms were\r\nagreed to and the Cherokees and Nanticokes ever remained faithful to\r\nthe conditions of the treaty.\r\n\r\nThe inference to be drawn from this legend, if it can be given any\r\ncredit whatever, would lead to the belief that the Cherokees and the\r\nNanticokes were at that time neighbors and allies. The original home\r\nof the Nanticokes on the Eastern Shore of Maryland is well known, and\r\nif the Cherokees (or at least this portion of them) were then resident\r\nbeyond the Alleghanies, with sundry other powerful tribes occupying\r\nthe territory between them and the Nanticokes, it is unlikely that any\r\nsuch alliance for offensive operations would have existed between them.\r\nEither the tradition is fabulous or at least a portion of the Cherokees\r\nwere probably at one time residents of the Eastern slope of Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe Delawares also have a tradition that they came originally from the\r\nwest, and found a tribe called by them Allegewi or Allegans occupying\r\nthe eastern portion of the Ohio Valley. With the aid of the Iroquois,\r\nwith whom they came in contact about the same time, the Delawares\r\nsucceeded in driving the Allegans out of the Ohio Valley to the\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nSchoolcraft suggests the identity of the Allegans with the Cherokees,\r\nan idea that would seem to be confirmatory of the tradition given by\r\nHaywood, in so far as it relates to an early Cherokee occupancy of Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY CONTACT WITH VIRGINIA COLONISTS.\r\n\r\nWhatever the degree of probability attending these legends, it\r\nwould seem that the settlers of Virginia had an acquaintance with\r\nthe Cherokees prior to that of the South Carolina immigrants, who\r\nfor a number of years after their first occupation, confined their\r\nexplorations to a narrow strip of country in the vicinity of the\r\nsea-coast, while the Virginians had been gradually extending their\r\nsettlements far up toward the headwaters of the James River and had\r\nearly perceived the profits to be derived from the Indian trade.\r\n\r\nSir William Berkeley, governor of Virginia, equipped an expedition,\r\nconsisting of fourteen Englishmen and an equal number of Virginia\r\nIndians, for the exploration of the country to the west of the existing\r\nsettlements. The party was under the command of Capt. Henry Batt, and\r\nin seven days' travel from their point of departure, at Appomattox,\r\nthey reached the foot of the mountains. The first ridge they crossed\r\nis described as not being very high or steep, but the succeeding ones\r\n\"seemed to touch the clouds,\" and were so steep that an average day's\r\nmarch did not exceed three miles.\r\n\r\nThey came upon extensive and fertile valleys, covered with luxuriant\r\ngrass, and found the forests abounding in all kinds of game, including\r\nturkeys, deer, elk, and buffalo. After passing beyond the mountains\r\nthey entered an extensive level country, through which a stream flowed\r\nin a westward course, and after following it for a few days they\r\nreached some old fields and recently deserted Indian cabins. Beyond\r\nthis point their Indian guides refused to proceed, alleging that\r\nnot far away dwelt a powerful tribe that never suffered strangers\r\nwho discovered their towns to return alive, and the expedition was\r\ntherefore compelled to return. According to the historian, Burke, this\r\nexpedition took place in 1667, while Beverly, not quite so definite,\r\nassigns it to the decade between 1666 and 1676.[5] It is believed that\r\nthe powerful nation of Indians alluded to in the narrative of this\r\nexpedition was the Cherokees, and, if so, it is apparently the first\r\nallusion made to them in the history of the colonial settlements.\r\n\r\nThat the Virginians were the first to be brought in contact with the\r\nCherokees is further evidenced by the fact that in 1690 an Indian\r\ntrader from that colony, bearing the name of Daugherty, had taken up\r\nhis residence among them, which is alleged by the historian[6] to\r\nhave been several years before any knowledge of the existence of the\r\nCherokees reached the settlers on Ashley River in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY RELATIONS WITH CAROLINA COLONISTS.\r\n\r\nThe first formal introduction of the Cherokees to the notice of the\r\npeople of that colony occurred in the year 1693,[7] when twenty\r\nCherokee chiefs visited Charleston, with proposals of friendship, and\r\nat the same time solicited the assistance of the governor in their\r\noperations against the Esau and Coosaw tribes, who had captured and\r\ncarried off a number of Cherokees.\r\n\r\nThe Savannah Indians, it seems, had also been engaged in incursions\r\nagainst them, in the course of which they had captured a number of\r\nCherokees and sold them to the colonial authorities as slaves.\r\n\r\nThe delegation urgently solicited the governor's protection from the\r\nfurther aggressions of these enemies and the return of their bondaged\r\ncountrymen. The desired protection was promised them, but as their\r\nenslaved brethren had already been shipped to the West Indies and sold\r\ninto slavery there, it was impossible to return them.\r\n\r\nThe extreme eastern settlements of the Cherokees at this time were\r\nwithin the limits of the present Chester and Fairfield districts, South\r\nCarolina, which lie between the Catawba and Broad Rivers.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTION BY VARIOUS EARLY AUTHORS.\r\n\r\nWe next find an allusion to the Cherokees in the annals of Louisiana by\r\nM. Pericaut, who mentions in his chronicle of the events of the year\r\n1702, that \"ten leagues from the mouth of this river [Ohio] another\r\nfalls into it called Kasquinempas [Tennessee]. It takes its source from\r\nthe neighborhood of the Carolinas and passes through the village of the\r\nCherokees, a populous nation that number some fifty thousand warriors,\"\r\nanother example of the enormous overestimates of aboriginal population\r\nto which the earlier travelers and writers were so prone.\r\n\r\nAgain, in 1708, the same author relates that \"about this time two\r\nMobilians who had married in the Alibamon nation, and who lived among\r\nthem with their families, discovered that that nation was inimical to\r\nthe Mobilians as well as the French, and had made a league with the\r\nCheraquis, the Abeikas, and the Conchaques to wage war against the\r\nFrench and Mobilians and burn their villages around our fort.\"\r\n\r\nOn various early maps of North America, and particularly those of De\r\nL'Isle, between the years 1700 and 1712, will be found indicated upon\r\nthe extreme headwaters of the Holston and Clinch Rivers, \"gros villages\r\ndes Cheraqui.\" These villages correspond in location with the great\r\nnation alluded to in the narrative of Sir William Berkeley's expedition.\r\n\r\nUpon the same maps will be found designated the sites of sundry other\r\nCherokee villages, several of which are on the extreme headwaters of\r\nthe \"R. des Chaouanons.\" This river, although indicated on the map\r\nas emptying into the Atlantic Ocean to the west of the Santee, from\r\nits relation to the other streams in that vicinity, is believed to be\r\nintended for the Broad River, which is a principal northwest branch of\r\nthe Santee. Other towns will also be found on the banks of the Upper\r\nCatawba, and they are, as well, quite numerous along the headwaters of\r\nthe \"R. des Caouilas\" or Savannah and of the Little Tennessee.\r\n\r\nMention is again found of the Cherokees in the year 1712, when 218\r\nof them accompanied Colonel Barnwell in his expedition against the\r\nhostile Tuscaroras and aided in the subjugation of that savage tribe,\r\nthough along the route of Barnwell's march the settlers were very\r\nnearly persuaded that they suffered greater damage to property from\r\nthe freebooting propensities of their Indian allies than from the open\r\nhostilities of their savage enemies.\r\n\r\nThe old colonial records of South Carolina also contain mention in the\r\nfollowing year (1713) of the fact that Peter St. Julien was arraigned\r\non the charge of holding two Cherokee women in slavery.[9]\r\n\r\nIn 1715 the Yamassees, a powerful and hitherto friendly tribe,\r\noccupying the southwesterly portion of the colony of South Carolina and\r\nextending to and beyond the Savannah River, declared open hostilities\r\nagainst the settlers. In the desperate struggle that ensued, we find\r\nin full alliance with them the Cherokees, as well as the Creeks and\r\nAppalachians.\r\n\r\nIn his historical journal of the establishment of the French in\r\nLouisiana, Bernard de la Harpe states that \"in January, 1716, some\r\nof the Cheraquis Indians, who lived northeast of Mobile, killed MM.\r\nde Ramsay and de Longueil. Some time after, the father of the latter\r\ngentleman, the King's lieutenant in Canada, engaged the Iroquois to\r\nsurprise this tribe. They sacked two of their villages and obliged the\r\nrest to retreat towards New England.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTERRITORY OF CHEROKEES AT PERIOD OF ENGLISH SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the English settlement of the Carolinas the Cherokees\r\noccupied a diversified and well-watered region of country of large\r\nextent upon the waters of the Catawba, Broad, Saluda, Keowee, Tugaloo,\r\nSavannah, and Coosa Rivers on the east and south, and several of the\r\ntributaries of the Tennessee on the north and west. It is impossible\r\nat this late day to define with absolute accuracy the original limits\r\nof the Cherokee claim. In fact, like all other tribes, they had no\r\ndefinite and concurrent understanding with their surrounding savage\r\nneighbors where the possessions of the one left off and those of the\r\nother began. The strength of their title to any particular tract of\r\ncountry usually decreased in proportion to the increase of the distance\r\nfrom their villages; and it commonly followed as a result, that a\r\nconsiderable strip of territory between the settlements of two powerful\r\ntribes, though claimed by both, was practically considered as neutral\r\nground and the common hunting ground of both.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the extreme eastern settlements of\r\nthe Cherokees in South Carolina in 1693 were in the district of\r\ncountry lying between the Catawba and Broad Rivers, and no claim has\r\nbeen found showing the existence at any time of any assertion of\r\nterritorial right in their behalf to the east of the former stream.\r\nBut nevertheless, on Bowen's map of 1752 (obviously copied from earlier\r\nmaps), there is laid down the name of \"Keowee Old Town.\" The location\r\nof this town was on Deep River in the vicinity of the present town\r\nof Ashborough, N. C. It was a favorite name of the Cherokees among\r\ntheir towns, and affords a strong evidence of at least a temporary\r\nresidence of a portion of the tribe in that vicinity. A map executed\r\nby John Senex in 1721 defines the Indian boundary in this region as\r\nfollowing the Catawba, Wateree, and Santee Rivers as far down as\r\nthe most westerly bend of the latter stream, in the vicinity of the\r\nboundary line between Orangeburg and Charleston districts, whence it\r\npursued a southwesterly course to the Edisto River, which it followed\r\nto the sea-coast. The southern portion of this boundary was of course\r\na definition of limits between Carolina and the Creeks, or rather of\r\ncertain tribes that formed component parts of the Creek confederacy. No\r\nevidence has been discovered tending to show an extension of Cherokee\r\nlimits in a southerly direction beyond the point mentioned above on\r\nthe Edisto River, which, as near as can be ascertained, was at the\r\njunction of the North and South Edisto. Following from thence up the\r\nSouth Edisto to its source the boundary pursued a southwesterly course,\r\nstriking the Savannah River in the vicinity of the mouth of Stevens\r\nCreek, and proceeding thence northwardly along the Savannah.\r\n\r\nOn the borders of Virginia and North Carolina the ancient limits of the\r\nCherokees seem to be also shrouded in more or less doubt and confusion.\r\nIn general terms, however, it may be said that after following the\r\nCatawba River to its source in the Blue Ridge the course of those\r\nmountains was pursued until their intersection with the continuation of\r\nthe Great Iron Mountain range, near Floyd Court-House, Va., and thence\r\nto the waters of the Kanawha or New River, whence their claim continued\r\ndown that stream to the Ohio. At a later date they also set up a claim\r\nto the country extending from the mouth of the Kanawha down the Ohio\r\nto the ridge dividing the waters of the Cumberland from those of the\r\nTennessee at the mouths of those streams, and thence following that\r\nridge to a point northeast of the mouth of Duck River; thence to the\r\nmouth of Duck River on the Tennessee, and continuing up with the course\r\nof the latter river to Bear Creek; up the latter to a point called Flat\r\nRock, and thence to the Ten Islands in Coosa River, &c.\r\n\r\nThat portion of the country thus covered, comprising a large part of\r\nthe present States of West Virginia and Kentucky, was also claimed by\r\nthe Six Nations by right of former conquest, as well as by the Shawnees\r\nand Delawares.\r\n\r\nAdair, a trader for forty years among the Cherokees, who traveled\r\nextensively through their country about the middle of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, thus specifically outlines the boundaries of their country\r\nat that period: \"The country lies in about 34 degrees north\r\nlatitude at the distance of 340 computed miles to the northwest of\r\nCharlestown,--140 miles west-southwest from the Katahba Nation,--and\r\nalmost 200 miles to the north of the Muskohge or Creek country. They\r\nare settled nearly in an east and west course about 140 miles in\r\nlength from the lower towns, where Fort-Prince-George stands, to the\r\nlate unfortunate Fort Loudon. The natives make two divisions of their\r\ncountry, which they term '_Ayrate_' and '_Otarre_,' the one signifying\r\n'low' and the other 'mountainous.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION.\r\n\r\nIn point of numbers the Cherokee population now considerably exceeds\r\nthat first enumerated by the early colonial authorities. As early\r\nas 1715 the proprietors of the South Carolina Plantation instructed\r\nGovernor Robert Johnson to cause a census to be taken of all the\r\nIndian tribes within that jurisdiction, and from his report it appears\r\nthat the Cherokee Nation at that time contained thirty towns and an\r\naggregate population of 11,210, of whom 4,000 were warriors. Adair\r\nalleges that in 1735, or thereabouts, according to the computation\r\nof the traders, their warriors numbered 6,000, but that in 1738 the\r\nravages of the small-pox reduced their population one-half within one\r\nyear. Indeed, this disaster, coupled with the losses sustained in\r\ntheir conflicts with the whites and with neighboring tribes, had so\r\nfar wasted their ranks that a half century after the census taken by\r\nGovernor Johnson they were estimated by the traders to have but 2,300\r\nwarriors.[10] By the last report of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\r\nthe total population is estimated to number 22,000.[11] It is true that\r\nconsiderable of this increase is attributable to the fact that several\r\nother small tribes or bands, within a few years past, have merged their\r\ntribal existence in that of the Cherokees. Independent of this fact,\r\nhowever, they have maintained a slow but steady increase in numbers for\r\nmany years, with the exception of the severe losses sustained during\r\nthe disastrous period of the late southern rebellion.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD CHEROKEE TOWNS.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps impossible to give a complete list of the old Cherokee\r\ntowns and their location; but in 1755 the authorities of South\r\nCarolina, in remodeling the old and prescribing new regulations for the\r\ngovernment of the Indian trade, divided the whole Cherokee country into\r\nsix hunting districts, viz:\r\n\r\n1. _Over Hill Towns._--Great Tellico, Chatugee, Tennessee, Chote,\r\nToqua, Sittiquo, and Talassee.\r\n\r\n2. _Valley Towns._--Euforsee, Conastee, Little Telliquo, Cotocanahut,\r\nNayowee, Tomatly, and Chewohe.\r\n\r\n3. _Middle Towns._--Joree, Watoge, Nuckasee.\r\n\r\n4. _Keowee Towns._--Keowee, Tricentee, Echoee, Torsee, Cowee, Torsalla,\r\nCoweeshee, and Elejoy.\r\n\r\n5. _Out Towns._--Tucharechee, Kittowa, Conontoroy, Steecoy, Oustanale,\r\nand Tuckasegee.\r\n\r\n6. _Lower Towns._--Tomassee, Oustestee, Cheowie, Estatoie, Tosawa,\r\nKeowee, and Oustanalle.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years later, Bartram,[12] who traversed the country, gives\r\nthe names of forty-three Cherokee towns and villages then existing and\r\ninhabited as follows:\r\n\r\n  -----+---------------------+------------------------------------------\r\n  No.  |        Name.        |            Where situated.\r\n  -----+---------------------+------------------------------------------\r\n  1    |   Echoe             | }\r\n  2    |   Nucasse           | } On the Tanase east of\r\n  3    |   Whatoga           | }   Jore Mountains.\r\n  4    |   Cowe              | }\r\n       |                     |\r\n  5    |   Ticoloosa         | }\r\n  6    |   Jore              | } Inland, on the branches\r\n  7    |   Conisca           | }   of the Tanase.\r\n  8    |   Nowe              | }\r\n       |                     |\r\n  9    |   Tomothle          | }\r\n  10   |   Noewe             | }\r\n  11   |   Tellico           | }\r\n  12   |   Clennuse          | } On the Tanase over the Jore\r\n  13   |   Occunolufte       | }   Mountains.\r\n  14   |   Chewe             | }\r\n  15   |   Quanuse           | }\r\n  16   |   Tellowe           | }\r\n       |                     |\r\n  17   |   Tellico           | }\r\n  18   |   Chatuga           | }  Inland towns on the branches of\r\n  19   |   Hiwasse           | }    the Tanase and other waters over\r\n  20   |   Chewase           | }    the Jore Mountains.\r\n  21   |   Nuanba            | }\r\n       |                     |\r\n  22   |   Tallase           | }\r\n  23   |   Chelowe           | }\r\n  24   |   Sette             | }\r\n  25   |   Chote, great      | }\r\n  26   |   Joco              | } Overhill towns on the Tanase or\r\n  27   |   Tahasse           | }   Cherokee River.\r\n  28   |   Tamahle           | }\r\n  29   |   Tuskege           | }\r\n  30   |   -- -- Big Island  | }\r\n  31   |   Nilaque           | }\r\n  32   |   Niowe             | }\r\n       |                     |\r\n  33   |   Sinica            | } Lower towns east of the mountains on\r\n  34   |   Keowe             | }   the Savanna or Keowe River.\r\n  35   |   Kulsage           | }\r\n       |                     |\r\n  36   |   Tugilo            | } Lower towns east of the mountains\r\n  37   |   Estotowe          | }   on Tugilo River.\r\n       |                     |\r\n  38   |   Qualatche         | } Lower towns on Flint River.\r\n  39   |   Chote             | }\r\n       |                     |\r\n  40   |   Estotewe, great   | }\r\n  41   |   Allagae           | } Towns on waters of other rivers.\r\n  42   |   Jore              | }\r\n  43   |   Naeoche           | }\r\n  -----+---------------------+------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nMouzon's map of 1771 gives the names of several Lower Cherokee towns\r\nnot already mentioned. Among these may be enumerated, on the Tugalco\r\nRiver and its branches, Turruraw, Nayowee, Tetohe, Chagee, Tussee,\r\nChicherohe, Echay, and Takwashnaw; on the Keowee, New Keowee, and\r\nQuacoretche; and on the Seneca, Acounee.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent years, through frequent and long continued conflicts\r\nwith the ever advancing white settlements and the successive treaties\r\nwhereby the Cherokees gradually yielded portions of their domain, the\r\nlocation and names of their towns were continually changing until the\r\nfinal removal of the nation west of the Mississippi.[13]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPULSION OF SHAWNEES BY CHEROKEES AND CHICKASAWS.\r\n\r\nIn the latter portion of the seventeenth century the Shawnees, or a\r\nportion of them, had their villages on the Cumberland, and to some\r\nextent, perhaps, on the Tennessee also. They were still occupying that\r\nregion as late as 1714, when they were visited by M. Charleville, a\r\nFrench trader, but having about this time incurred the hostility of the\r\nCherokees and Chickasaws they were driven from the country. Many years\r\nlater, in the adjustment of a territorial dispute between the Cherokees\r\nand Chickasaws, each nation claimed the sole honor of driving out the\r\nShawnees, and hence, by right of conquest, the title to the territory\r\nformerly inhabited by the latter. The Chickasaws evidently had the best\r\nof the controversy, though some concessions were made to the Cherokees\r\nin the matter when the United States came to negotiate for the purchase\r\nof the controverted territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY RELATIONS WITH THE COLONIES.\r\n\r\n_Treaty and purchase of 1721._--The treaty relations between the\r\nCherokees and the whites began in 1721, when jealousy of French\r\nterritorial encroachments persuaded Governor Nicholson of South\r\nCarolina to invite the Cherokees to a general congress, with a view to\r\nthe conclusion of a treaty of peace and commerce.\r\n\r\nThe invitation was accepted, and delegates attended from thirty-seven\r\ntowns, with whom, after smoking the pipe of peace and distributing\r\npresents, he agreed upon defined boundaries and appointed an agent to\r\nsuperintend their affairs.[14]\r\n\r\n_Treaty of 1730._--Again, in 1730, the authorities of North Carolina\r\ncommissioned Sir Alexander Cumming to conclude a treaty of alliance\r\nwith the Cherokees. In April of that year the chiefs and warriors of\r\nthe nation met him at Requasse, near the sources of the Hiwassee River,\r\nacknowledged King George as their sovereign, and sent a delegation of\r\nsix warriors to carry the crown of the nation (consisting of five eagle\r\ntails and four scalps) to England and do homage to the King, where they\r\nconcluded a treaty of peace and commerce at Dover on the 30th of June.\r\n\r\nIn this treaty they stipulated:\r\n\r\n1. To submit to the sovereignty of the King and his successors.\r\n\r\n2. Not to trade with any other nation but the English.\r\n\r\n3. Not to permit any but English to build forts or cabins or plant corn\r\namong them.\r\n\r\n4. To apprehend and deliver runaway negroes.\r\n\r\n5. To surrender any Indian killing an Englishman.[15]\r\n\r\n_Treaty and purchase of 1755._--November 24, 1755, a further treaty was\r\nconcluded between the Cherokees and Governor Glenn, of South Carolina.\r\nBy its terms the former ceded to Great Britain a territory which\r\nincluded the limits of the modern districts of Abbeville, Edgefield,\r\nLaurens, Union, Spartanburg, Newberry, Chester, Fairfield, Richland,\r\nand York, and deeds of conveyance were drawn up and formally executed\r\ntherefor.[16] This cession included a tract of country between the\r\nBroad and Catawba Rivers which was also claimed and generally conceded\r\nto belong to the Catawba Nation, the boundary line between the latter\r\nand the Cherokees being usually fixed as the Broad River.[17] One of\r\nthe main objects of this treaty was to prevent an alliance between the\r\nCherokees and the French.\r\n\r\n_Treaty of 1756._--In the year 1756 Hugh Waddell was commissioned by\r\nthe authorities of North Carolina to treat with the Cherokees and\r\nCatawbas. In pursuance of this authority he concluded a treaty of\r\nalliance with both nations.[18] Governor Glenn, also, in the same\r\nyear erected a chain of military posts on the frontiers of his recent\r\npurchase. These consisted of Fort Prince George, on the Savannah,\r\nwithin gunshot of the Indian town of Keowee; Fort Moore, 170 miles\r\nfarther down the river; and Fort London, on the south bank of Tennessee\r\nRiver, at the highest point of navigation, at the mouth of Tellico\r\nRiver.[19]\r\n\r\n_Captain Jack's purchase._--A grant signed by Arthur Dobbs, governor\r\nof North Carolina, et al., and by The Little Carpenter, half king of\r\nthe Over-Hill Cherokees, made to Capt. Patrick Jack, of Pennsylvania,\r\nis recorded in the register's office of Knox County, Tennessee. It\r\npurports to have been made at a council held at Tennessee River, March\r\n1, 1757, consideration $400, and conveys to Captain Jack 15 miles\r\nsquare south of Tennessee River. The grant itself confirmatory of the\r\npurchase by Captain Jack is dated at a general council held at Catawba\r\nRiver, May 7, 1762.[20]\r\n\r\n_Treaty of 1760._--The French finally succeeded in enlisting the active\r\nsympathy of the Cherokees in their war with Great Britain. Governor\r\nLittleton, of South Carolina, marched against the Indians and defeated\r\nthem, after which, in 1760, he concluded a treaty of peace with them.\r\nBy its terms they agreed to kill or imprison every Frenchman who should\r\ncome into their country during the continuance of the war between\r\nFrance and Great Britain.[21]\r\n\r\n_Treaty of 1761._--The hostile course of the Cherokees being still\r\ncontinued, the authorities of South Carolina in 1761 dispatched Colonel\r\nGrant with a force sufficient to overcome them. After destroying\r\ntheir crops and fifteen towns he compelled a truce, following which\r\nLieutenant Governor Bull concluded a treaty with them at Ashley Ferry,\r\nor Charleston.[22] By this instrument the boundaries between the\r\nIndians and the settlements were declared to be the sources of the\r\ngreat rivers flowing into the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nIn 1767 the legislature of North Carolina made an appropriation and\r\nthe governor appointed three commissioners for running a dividing-line\r\nbetween the western settlements of that province and the Cherokee\r\nhunting grounds.[23]\r\n\r\n_Treaty and purchase of 1768._--Mr. Stuart, the British superintendent\r\nof Indian affairs, on the 14th of October, 1768, concluded a treaty\r\nwith the Cherokees at Hard Labor, South Carolina. Therein it was agreed\r\nthat the southwest boundary of Virginia should be a line \"extending\r\nfrom the point where the northern line of North Carolina intersects\r\nthe Cherokee hunting grounds about 36 miles east of Long Island in the\r\nHolston River; and thence extending in a direct course north by east to\r\nChiswell's mine on the east bank of the Kenhawa River, and thence down\r\nthat stream to its junction with the Ohio.\"[24]\r\n\r\nThis treaty was made in pursuance of appeals from the Indians to stop\r\nfurther encroachments of settlers upon their lands and to have their\r\nboundaries definitely fixed, especially in the region of the north fork\r\nof Holston River and the headwaters of the Kanawha.\r\n\r\n_Treaty and purchase of 1770._--The settlements having encroached\r\nbeyond the line fixed by the treaty of 1768, a new treaty was concluded\r\non the 18th October, 1770, at Lochabar, South Carolina. A new boundary\r\nline was established by this treaty commencing on the south bank of\r\nHolston River six miles east of Long Island, and running thence to the\r\nmouth of the Great Kanawha.[25]\r\n\r\n_Treaty and purchase of 1772._--The Virginia authorities in the early\r\npart of 1772 concluded a treaty with the Cherokees whereby a boundary\r\nline was fixed between them, which was to run west from White Top\r\nMountain in latitude 36° 30'.[26] This boundary left those settlers on\r\nthe Watauga River within the Indian limits, whereupon, as a measure\r\nof temporary relief, they leased for a period of eight years from the\r\nIndians in consideration of goods to the value of five or six thousand\r\ndollars all the country on the waters of the Watauga. Subsequently in\r\n1775 [March 19] they secured a deed in fee simple therefor upon the\r\nfurther consideration of £2,000.[27] This deed was executed to Charles\r\nRobertson as the representative or trustee of the Watauga Settlers'\r\nAssociation, and embraced the following tract of country, viz: All\r\nthat tract on the waters of the Watauga, Holston, and Great Canaway or\r\nNew River, beginning on the south or southwest of Holston River six\r\nmiles above Long Island in that river; thence a direct line in nearly\r\na south course to the ridge dividing the waters of Watauga from the\r\nwaters of Nonachuckeh and along the ridge in a southeasterly direction\r\nto the Blue Ridge or line dividing North Carolina from the Cherokee\r\nlands; thence along the Blue Ridge to the Virginia line and west along\r\nsuch line to the Holston River; thence down the Holston River to the\r\nbeginning, including all the waters of the Watauga, part of the waters\r\nof the Holston, and the head branches of New River or Great Canaway,\r\nagreeable to the aforesaid boundaries.\r\n\r\n_Jacob Brown's purchase._--Jacob Brown, in 1772, for a horse load of\r\ngoods leased from the Cherokees a tract on the Watauga and Nonachuchy\r\nRivers.\r\n\r\nThree years later (March 25, 1775) for a further consideration of ten\r\nshillings he secured from them a deed in fee for the leased tract as\r\nwell as an additional tract of considerable extent.\r\n\r\nThe boundary of the first of these bodies of land ran from the mouth\r\nof Great Limestone Creek, thence up the same and its main fork to the\r\nridge dividing the Wataugah and Nonachuchy Rivers; thence to the head\r\nof Indian Creek, where it joins the Great Iron Mountains, and along\r\nthose mountains to the Nonachuchy River; across the Nonachuchy River,\r\nincluding its creeks, and down the side of Nonachuchy Mountain against\r\nthe mouth of Great Limestone Creek and from thence to the place of\r\nbeginning.\r\n\r\nThe second purchase comprised a tract lying on the Nonachuchy River\r\nbelow the mouth of Big Limestone on both sides of the river and\r\nadjoining the tract just described. Its boundaries were defined as\r\nbeginning on the south side of the Nonachuchy River below the old\r\nfields that lie below the Limestone on the north side of Nonachuchy\r\nMountain at a large rock; thence north 32° west to the mouth of Camp\r\nCreek on the south side of the river; thence across the river; thence\r\npursuing a northwesterly course to the dividing ridge between Lick\r\nCreek and Watauga or Holston River, thence along the dividing ridge to\r\nthe rest of Brown's lands; thence down the main fork of Big Limestone\r\nto its mouth; thence crossing the Nonachuchy River and pursuing a\r\nstraight course to the Nonachuchy Mountains and along such mountains to\r\nthe beginning.[28]\r\n\r\n_Treaty and purchase of 1773._--On the 1st of June, 1773, a treaty\r\nwas concluded jointly with the Creeks and Cherokees by the British\r\nsuperintendent whereby they ceded to Great Britain a tract beginning\r\nwhere the lower Creek path intersects the Ogeechee River, thence along\r\nthe main channel of that river to the source of the southernmost branch\r\nthereof; thence along the ridge between the waters of Broad and Oconee\r\nRivers up to the Buffalo Lick; thence in a straight line to the tree\r\nmarked by the Cherokees near the head of the branch falling into the\r\nOconee River [on the line between Clarke and Oglethorpe Counties, about\r\n8 miles southeast of Athens]; thence along the said ridge 20 miles\r\nabove the line already run by the Cherokees, and from thence across to\r\nthe Savannah River by a line parallel to that formerly marked by them.\r\n\r\n_Henderson's purchase by the treaty of 1775._--On the 17th of March,\r\n1775, Richard Henderson and eight other private citizens concluded a\r\ntreaty with the Cherokees at Sycamore Shoals, on Watauga River. By its\r\nterms they became the purchasers from the latter (in consideration of\r\n£10,000 worth of merchandise) of all the lands lying between Kentucky\r\nand Cumberland Rivers, under the name of the Colony of Transylvania in\r\nNorth America. This purchase was contained in two deeds, one of which\r\nwas commonly known as the \"Path Deed,\" and conveyed the following\r\ndescribed tract: \"Begin on the Holston River, where the course of\r\nPowell's Mountain strikes the same; thence up the river to the crossing\r\nof the Virginia line; thence westerly along the line run by Donelson\r\n* * * to a point six (6) English miles east of Long Island in Holston\r\nRiver; thence a direct course towards the mouth of the Great Kanawha\r\nuntil it reaches the top of the ridge of Powell's Mountain; thence\r\nwesterly along said ridge to the beginning.\"\r\n\r\nThis tract was located in Northeast Tennessee and the extreme\r\nsouthwestern corner of Virginia.[29] The second deed covered a much\r\nlarger area of territory and was generally known as the \"Great Grant.\"\r\nIt comprised the territory \"beginning on the Ohio River at the mouth\r\nof the Kentucky, Cherokee, or what, by the English, is called Louisa\r\nRiver; thence up said river and the most northwardly fork of the same\r\nto the head-spring thereof; thence a southeast course to the ridge of\r\nPowell's Mountain; thence westwardly along the ridge of said mountain\r\nto a point from which a northwest course will strike the head-spring\r\nof the most southwardly branch of Cumberland River; thence down said\r\nriver, including all its waters, to the Ohio River; thence up said\r\nriver as it meanders to the beginning.\"[30] This tract comprises nearly\r\nthe whole of Central and Western Kentucky as well as part of Northern\r\nCentral Tennessee. Although a literal reading of these boundaries would\r\ninclude all the territory watered by the Cumberland River and its\r\nbranches, the general understanding seems to have been (and it is so\r\nspecifically stated in the report of the treaty commissioners of 1785)\r\nthat Henderson's purchase did not extend south of Cumberland River\r\nproper.[31] The entire purchase included in both these deeds is shown\r\nas one tract on the accompanying map of cessions and numbered 7.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is proper to remark that all of these grants to\r\nprivate individuals were regarded as legally inoperative, though in\r\nsome instances the beneficiaries were permitted to enjoy the benefits\r\nof their purchases in a modified degree. All such purchases had been\r\ninhibited by royal proclamation of King George III, under date of\r\nOctober 7, 1763,[32] wherein all provincial governors were forbidden\r\nto grant lands or issue land warrants locatable upon any territory\r\nwest of the mountains or of the sources of streams flowing into the\r\nAtlantic. All private persons were enjoined from purchasing lands from\r\nthe Indians. All purchases made of such lands should be for the Crown\r\nby the governor or commander-in-chief of the colony at some general\r\ncouncil or assembly of the Indians convened for that purpose.\r\n\r\nIn the particular purchase made by Henderson and his coadjutors, the\r\nbenefits thereof were afterwards claimed by the authorities of Virginia\r\nand North Carolina for those States, as the successors of the royal\r\nprerogative within their respective limits. In consideration, however,\r\nof Henderson's valuable services on the frontier, and in compensation\r\nfor his large expenditures of money in negotiating the purchase,\r\nthe legislature of North Carolina in 1783 granted to him and those\r\ninterested with him a tract of 200,000 acres,[33] constituting a strip\r\n4 miles in width from old Indian town on Powell's River to the mouth,\r\nand thence a strip down the Clinch River for quantity 12 miles in\r\nwidth. The legislature of Virginia also granted them a tract of like\r\nextent upon the Ohio River, opposite Evansville, Indiana.[34]\r\n\r\n_Treaties and purchases of 1777._--In consequence of continued\r\nhostilities between the Cherokees and the settlers, General Williamson\r\nin 1776 marched an army from South Carolina and destroyed the towns of\r\nthe former on Keowee and Tugaloo Rivers. General Rutherford marched\r\nanother force from North Carolina and Colonel Christian a third\r\nfrom Virginia, and destroyed most of their principal towns on the\r\nTennessee.[35]\r\n\r\nAt the conclusion of hostilities with the Cherokees, following these\r\nexpeditions, a treaty with them was concluded May 20, 1777, at De\r\nWitt's or Duett's Corners, South Carolina, by the States of South\r\nCarolina and Georgia. By the terms of this treaty the Indians ceded a\r\nconsiderable region of country upon the Savannah and Saluda Rivers,[36]\r\ncomprising all their lands in South Carolina to the eastward of the\r\nUnacaye Mountains.\r\n\r\nTwo months later (July 20) Commissioners Preston, Christian, and\r\nShelby, on the part of Virginia, and Avery, Sharpe, Winston, and\r\nLanier, for North Carolina, also concluded a treaty with the Cherokees,\r\nby which, in the establishment of a boundary between the contracting\r\nparties, some parts of \"Brown's line,\" previously mentioned, were\r\nagreed upon as a portion of the boundary, and the Indians relinquished\r\ntheir lands as low down on Holston River as the mouth of Cloud's Creek.\r\nTo this treaty the Chicamauga band of Cherokees refused to give their\r\nassent.[37]\r\n\r\nThe boundaries defined by this treaty are alluded to and described\r\nin an act of the North Carolina legislature passed in the following\r\nyear, wherein it is stipulated that \"no person shall enter or survey\r\nany lands within the Indian hunting grounds, or without the limits\r\nheretofore ceded by them, which limits westward are declared to be as\r\nfollows: Begin at a point on the dividing line which hath been agreed\r\nupon between the Cherokees and the colony of Virginia, where the line\r\nbetween that Commonwealth and this State (hereafter to be extended)\r\nshall intersect the same; running thence a right line to the mouth of\r\nCloud's Creek, being the second creek below the Warrior's Ford, at the\r\nmouth of Carter's Valley; thence a right line to the highest point of\r\nChimney Top Mountain or High Rock; thence a right line to the mouth\r\nof Camp or McNamee's Creek, on south bank of Nolichucky, about ten\r\nmiles below the mouth of Big Limestone; from the mouth of Camp Creek\r\na southeast course to the top of Great Iron Mountain, being the same\r\nwhich divides the hunting grounds of the Overhill Cherokees from the\r\nhunting grounds of the middle settlements; and from the top of Iron\r\nMountain a south course to the dividing ridge between the waters of\r\nFrench Broad, and Nolichucky Rivers; thence a southwesterly course\r\nalong the ridge to the great ridge of the Appalachian Mountains, which\r\ndivide the eastern and western waters; thence with said dividing\r\nridge to the line that divides the State of South Carolina from this\r\nState.\"[38]\r\n\r\n_Emigration of Chicamauga band._--The Cherokees being very much\r\ncurtailed in their hunting grounds by the loss of the territory\r\nwrested from them by the terms of these two treaties, began a\r\nmovement further down the Tennessee River, and the most warlike and\r\nintractable portion of them, known as the Chicamaugas, settled and\r\nbuilt towns on Chicamauga Creek, about one hundred miles below the\r\nmouth of the Holston River. Becoming persuaded, however, that this\r\ncreek was infested with witches they abandoned it in 1782, and built\r\nlower down the Tennessee the towns usually called \"The Five Lower Towns\r\non the Tennessee.\" These towns were named respectively Running Water,\r\nNickajack, Long Island Village, Crow Town, and Lookout Mountain Town.\r\nFrom thence marauding parties were wont to issue in their operations\r\nagainst the rapidly encroaching settlements.[39]\r\n\r\nAlthough comparative peace and quiet for a time followed the heroic\r\ntreatment administered to the Indians by the expeditions of Williamson,\r\nRutherford, Christian, and others, reciprocal outrages between the\r\nwhites and Indians were of frequent occurrence. The situation was\r\naggravated in 1783 by the action of the assembly of North Carolina in\r\npassing an act (without consulting the Indians or making any effort\r\nto secure their concurrence) extending the western boundary of that\r\nState to the Mississippi River, reserving, however, for the use of the\r\nCherokees as a hunting ground a tract comprised between the point where\r\nthe Tennessee River first crosses the southern boundary of the State\r\nand the head waters of Big Pigeon River.[40]\r\n\r\n_Treaty and purchase of 1783._--On the 31st of May of this same\r\nyear, by a treaty concluded at Augusta, Ga., the Cherokee delegates\r\npresent (together with a few Creeks, who, on the 1st of November\r\nsucceeding, agreed to the cession) assumed to cede to that State\r\nthe respective claims of those two nations to the country lying on\r\nthe west side of the Tugaloo River, extending to and including the\r\nUpper Oconee River region.[41] With the provisions of this treaty\r\nno large or representative portion of either nation was satisfied,\r\nand in connection with the remarkable territorial assertions of the\r\nState of North Carolina, together with the constant encroachments of\r\nwhite settlers beyond the Indian boundary line, a spirit of restless\r\ndiscontent and fear was nourished among the Indians that resulted in\r\nmany acts of ferocious hostility.\r\n\r\n_Treaties with the State of Franklin._--In 1784, in consequence of the\r\ncession by North Carolina to the United States of all her claims to\r\nlands west of the mountains (which cession was not, however, accepted\r\nby the United States within the two years prescribed by the act) the\r\ncitizens within the limits of the present State of Tennessee elected\r\ndelegates to a convention, which formed a State organization under\r\nthe name of the State of Franklin and which maintained a somewhat\r\nprecarious political existence for about four years. During this\r\ninterval the authorities of the so-called State negotiated two treaties\r\nwith the Cherokee Nation, the first one being entered into near the\r\nmouth of Dumplin Creek, on the north bank of French Broad River, May\r\n31, 1785.[42] This treaty established the ridge dividing the waters of\r\nLittle River from those of the Tennessee as the dividing line between\r\nthe possessions of the whites and Indians, the latter ceding all claim\r\nto lands south of the French Broad and Holston, lying east of that\r\nridge. The second treaty or conference was held at Chote Ford and\r\nCoytoy, July 31 to August 3, 1786. The Franklin Commissioners at this\r\nconference modestly remarked, \"We only claim the island in Tennessee at\r\nthe mouth of Holston and from the head of the island to the dividing\r\nridge between the Holston River, Little River, and Tennessee to the\r\nBlue Ridge, and the lands North Carolina sold us on the north side\r\nof Tennessee.\" They urged this claim under threat of extirpating the\r\nCherokees as the penalty of refusal.[43]\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThis general history of the Cherokee Nation and the treaty relations\r\nthat had existed with the colonial authorities from the period of\r\ntheir first official contact with each other is given as preliminary\r\nto the consideration of the history and provisions of the first treaty\r\nnegotiated between commissioners on the part of the United States and\r\nthe said Cherokee Nation, viz, the treaty concluded at Hopewell, on the\r\nKeowee River, November 28, 1785, an abstract of the provisions of which\r\nis hereinbefore given.[44]\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of this treaty marked the beginning of a new era in the\r\nrelations between the whites and Cherokees. The boundaries then fixed\r\nwere the most favorable it was possible to obtain from the latter\r\nwithout regard to previous purchases and pretended purchases made\r\nby private individuals and others. Although the Indians yielded an\r\nextensive territory to the United States,[45] yet, on the other hand,\r\nthe latter conceded to the Cherokees a considerable extent of territory\r\nthat had already been purchased from them by private individuals or\r\nassociations, though by methods of more than doubtful legality.\r\n\r\nThe contentions between the border settlers of Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, South Carolina, and Georgia, as well as of the authorities\r\nof those States, with the Cherokees and Creeks, concerning boundaries\r\nand the constantly recurring mutual depredations and assaults upon\r\neach other's lives and property, prompted Congress, though still\r\nderiving its powers from the Articles of Confederation, to the\r\nactive exercise of its treaty-making functions. It was, therefore,\r\ndetermined[46] to appoint commissioners who should be empowered under\r\ntheir instructions, subject, of course, to ratification by Congress, to\r\nnegotiate a treaty with the Cherokees, at which the boundaries of the\r\nlands claimed by them should be as accurately ascertained as might be,\r\nand the line of division carefully marked between them and the white\r\nsettlements. This was deemed essential in order that authoritative\r\nproclamation might be made of the same, advising and warning settlers\r\nagainst further encroachments upon Indian territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCEEDINGS AT TREATY OF HOPEWELL.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners deputed for the performance of this duty were\r\nBenjamin Hawkins, Andrew Pickens, Joseph Martin, and Lachlan McIntosh.\r\nThey convened the Indians in council at Hopewell, S. C., on the 18th\r\nof November, 1785.[47] Hopewell is on the Keowee River, 15 miles\r\nabove the junction of that river with the Tugaloo. The commissioners\r\nannounced to the Indians the change of sovereignty from Great Britain\r\nto Congress that had taken place in the country as a consequence of the\r\nsuccessful termination of the Revolution. They further set forth that\r\nCongress wanted none of the Indian lands, nor anything else belonging\r\nto them, but that if they had any grievances, to state them freely,\r\nand Congress would see justice done them. The Indian chiefs drafted\r\na map showing the limits of country claimed by them, which included\r\nthe greater portion of Kentucky and Tennessee, as well as portions of\r\nNorth Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Being reminded by the\r\ncommissioners that this claim covered the country purchased by Colonel\r\nHenderson, who was now dead, and whose purchase must therefore not be\r\ndisputed, they consented to relinquish that portion of it. They also\r\nconsented that the line as finally agreed upon, from the mouth of\r\nDuck River to the dividing ridge between the Cumberland and Tennessee\r\nRivers, should be continued up that ridge and from thence to the\r\nCumberland in such a manner as to leave all the white settlers in the\r\nCumberland country outside of the Indian limits.\r\n\r\nAt the time, it was supposed this could be accomplished by running a\r\nnortheast line from the ridge so as to strike the Cumberland _forty\r\nmiles above Nashville_. This portion of the boundary, not having been\r\naffected by the treaty of 1791 (as was supposed by the Cherokees), was\r\nreiterated in that treaty in a reverse direction. But the language\r\nused--whether intentional or accidental--rendered it susceptible of a\r\nconstruction more favorable to the whites. This language read, \"Thence\r\ndown the Cumberland River to a point from which a southwest line will\r\nstrike the ridge which divides the waters of Cumberland from those of\r\nDuck River, 40 miles above Nashville.\" As this line was not actually\r\nsurveyed and marked until the fall of 1797,[48] and as the settlements\r\nin that locality had in the meantime materially advanced, it became\r\nnecessary, in order to exclude the bulk of the settlers from the\r\nIndian country, to take advantage of this technicality. The line was\r\nconsequently so run (from a point on said dividing ridge 40 miles above\r\nNashville) that it struck the Cumberland River about 1 mile above the\r\nmouth of Rock Castle River, a distance of perhaps 175 to 200 miles\r\nabove Nashville. This line was surveyed by General James Winchester,\r\nwho, under date of November 9, 1797, in a letter to General Robertson,\r\ndescribes a portion of it as running as follows:\r\n\r\n    From Walton's road to the Fort Blount road, which it crosses\r\n    near the two springs at the 32-mile tree; crosses Obey's River\r\n    about 6 or 7 miles from the mouth; Achmugh about 2 miles above\r\n    the Salt Lick; the South Fork of Cumberland, or Flute River, 5 or\r\n    6 miles from the mouth, and struck Cumberland River about a mile\r\n    above the mouth of Rock Castle.\r\n\r\nHe also adds that the total length of the line (from the dividing ridge\r\nto Cumberland River above Rock Castle) is 138-11/16 miles.\r\n\r\nThe Fort Blount here mentioned was on the south side of Cumberland\r\nRiver, about 6 miles in a direct line, southwest of Gainesboro', and\r\nthe road led from there to Walton's road, which it joined at or near\r\nthe present site of Cooksville.[49] Walton's or Caney Fork road led\r\nfrom Carthage in an easterly direction, and before the organization\r\nof Putnam County formed the boundary line between Overton and White\r\ncounties, from whence it continued easterly through Anderson's Cross\r\nRoads and Montgomery to Wilson's, in Knox County. The \"Two Springs,\"\r\nare about 2 or 3 miles northwest of Cooksville.[49]\r\n\r\nThere is much difficulty in determining the absolute course of the\r\n\"Winchester line,\" from the meager description contained in his letter\r\nabove quoted. Arrowsmith and Lewis, in their Atlas, published in 1805,\r\nlay down the line as pursuing a perfectly straight course from its\r\npoint of departure on the dividing ridge to its termination on the\r\nCumberland above the mouth of Rock Castle River. Their authority for\r\nsuch a definition of the boundary is not given. If such was the true\r\ncourse of the line, the description given in General Winchester's\r\nletter would need some explanation. He must have considered Obey's\r\nRiver as emptying into Wolf River in order to bring his crossing\r\nof the former stream reasonably near the distance from its mouth\r\nspecified by him. He must also have been mistaken in his estimate of\r\nthe distance at which the line crossed above the mouth of the South\r\nFork of the Cumberland. The line of Arrowsmith and Lewis would cross\r\nthat stream at least 12 miles in a direct line above its mouth,\r\ninstead of five or six. It is ascertained from correspondence with\r\nthe officers of the Historical Society of Tennessee, that the line,\r\nafter crossing the Fort Blount road at the \"Two Springs,\" continued in\r\na northeasterly direction, crossing Roaring Fork near the mouth of a\r\nsmall creek, and, pursuing the same course, passed to the east of the\r\ntown of Livingston. \"Nettle Carrier,\" a Cherokee Indian of some local\r\nnote, lived on the headwaters of Nettle Carrier's Creek, about four\r\nor five miles east of Livingston, and the line passed about half-way\r\nbetween his cabin and the present site of that village.[50] Thence it\r\ncontinued to the crossing of Obey's River, and thence to the point of\r\nintersection with the Kentucky boundary line, which is ascertained\r\nto have been at the northeast corner of Overton County, Tennessee,\r\nas originally organized in 1806. From this point the line continued\r\nto the crossing of Big South Fork, at the place indicated by General\r\nWinchester, and thence on to the Cumberland at the terminal point one\r\nmile above the mouth of Rock Castle River. In the interest of clearness\r\na literal following of the line indicated in General Winchester's\r\nletter, and also that given by Arrowsmith and Lewis, are shown upon\r\nthe accompanying map. At the conference preliminary to the signing of\r\nthe treaty of 1785, the Indians also asserted that within the fork of\r\nthe French Broad and Holston Rivers were 3,000 white settlers who were\r\nthere in defiance of their protests. They maintained that they had\r\nnever ceded that country, and it being a favorite spot with them the\r\nsettlers must be removed. The commissioners vainly endeavored to secure\r\na cession of the French Broad tract, remarking that the settlers were\r\ntoo numerous to make their removal possible, but could only succeed in\r\nsecuring the insertion of an article in the treaty, providing for the\r\nsubmission of the subject to Congress, the settlers, in the mean time,\r\nto remain unmolested.[51]\r\n\r\n_Protest of North Carolina and Georgia._--During the pendency of\r\nnegotiations, William Blount, of North Carolina, and John King and\r\nThomas Glasscock, of Georgia, presented their commissions as the agents\r\nrepresenting the interests of their respective States. They entered\r\nformal protests in the names of those States against the validity\r\nof the treaty, as containing several stipulations which infringed\r\nand violated the legislative rights thereof. The principal of these\r\nwas the right, as assumed by the commissioners, of assigning to the\r\nIndians, territory which had already been appropriated, by act of\r\nthe legislature in the case of North Carolina, to the discharge of\r\nbounty-land claims of the officers and soldiers of that State who had\r\nserved in the Continental line during the Revolution.[52]\r\n\r\nThere were present at this treaty, according to the report of the\r\ncommissioners, 918 Cherokees, to whom, after the signature and\r\nexecution thereof, were distributed as presents goods to the value\r\nof $1,311-10/90. The meagerness of the supply was occasioned, as the\r\ncommissioners explained, by their expectancy of only meeting the chiefs\r\nand headmen.[53]\r\n\r\n_Location of boundaries._--In the location of the boundary points\r\nbetween the Cherokees and whites, recited in the fourth article of the\r\ntreaty, it is proper to remark that--\r\n\r\n1. The route of the line along the ridge between Cumberland and\r\nTennessee Rivers, and from thence to the Cumberland, at a point 40\r\nmiles above Nashville, has already been recited.\r\n\r\n2. \"The ford where the Kentucky road crosses the river\" (Cumberland)\r\nis at a point opposite the mouth of Left-Hand Fork, about 12 or 13\r\nmiles slightly west of north of Cumberland Gap. From the point \"40\r\nmiles above Nashville\" to this ford, the commissioners adopted, as they\r\ndeclare, the line of Henderson's Purchase; while from the \"Kentucky\r\nFord\" to the mountain, 6 miles south of the mouth of Camp Creek on\r\nNolichucky, they followed the boundary prescribed by the treaty of July\r\n20, 1777, with Virginia and North Carolina.[54]\r\n\r\n3. \"Campbell's line\" was surveyed in 1777-'78 by General William\r\nCampbell, as a commissioner for marking the boundary between Virginia\r\nand the Cherokees. It extended from the mouth of Big Creek to the high\r\nknob on Poor Valley Ridge, 332 poles S. 70° E. of the summit of the\r\nmain ridge of Cumberland Mountain, a short distance west of Cumberland\r\nGap.[55] The point at which the treaty line of 1785 struck Campbell's\r\nline was at the Kentucky road crossing, about 1-1/2 miles southeast of\r\nCumberland Gap.\r\n\r\n4. The treaty line followed Campbell's line until it reached a point\r\ndue north of the mouth of Cloud's Creek. From this point it ran south\r\nto the mouth of that creek, which enters the Holston from the north, 3\r\nmiles west of Rogersville.\r\n\r\n5. The line from Cloud's Creek pursued a northeasterly direction to\r\nChimney Top Mountain, which it struck at a point about 2 miles to\r\nthe southward of the Long Island of Holston River.\r\n\r\n6. \"Camp Creek, near the mouth of Big Limestone, on the Nolichucky\"\r\n(which is the next point in the boundary line), is a south branch\r\nof Nolichucky River in Greene County, Tennessee, between Horse and\r\nCove Creeks, and empties about 6 miles southeast of Greeneville. It\r\nwas sometimes called McNamee's Creek.\r\n\r\n7. The mountain \"six miles to the southward of Camp Creek\" was in the\r\nGreat Smoky or Iron Range, not far from the head of that creek.\r\n\r\n8. \"Thence south to the North Carolina line, thence to the South\r\nCarolina Indian boundary.\" This line was partially surveyed in the\r\nwinter of 1791, by Joseph Hardin, under the direction of Governor\r\nBlount.[56] It ran southeasterly from the mouth of McNamee's or Camp\r\nCreek, a distance, as stated by Governor Blount, of 60 miles to\r\nRutherford's War Trace, although the point at which it struck this\r\n\"Trace,\" which is given in Governor Blount's correspondence as being 10\r\nor 12 miles west of the Swannanoa settlement, is only a trifle over 50\r\nmiles in a direct line from the mouth of Camp Creek.\r\n\r\nThe \"Rutherford's War Trace\" here spoken of was the route pursued\r\nby General Griffith Rutherford, who, in the summer of 1776, marched\r\nan army of 2,400 men against the Cherokees. He was re-enforced by\r\nColonels Martin and Armstrong at Cathey's Fort; crossed the Blue Ridge\r\nat Swannanæ Gap; passed down and over the French Broad at a place yet\r\nknown as the \"War Ford;\" continued up the valley of Hominy Creek,\r\nleaving Pisgah Mountain to the left and crossing Pigeon River a little\r\nbelow the mouth of East Fork; thence through the mountains to Richland\r\nCreek, above the present town of Waynesville; ascended that creek and\r\ncrossed Tuckaseigee River at an Indian village; continued across Cowee\r\nMountain, and thence to the Middle Cherokee Towns on Tennessee River,\r\nto meet General Williamson, from South Carolina, with an army bent on\r\na like mission.[57] The boundary between western North Carolina and\r\nSouth Carolina was not definitely established at the date of the survey\r\nof Hardin's line and, as shown by an old map on file in the Office of\r\nIndian Affairs, the point at which a prolongation of Hardin's line\r\nwould have struck the South Carolina Indian boundary was supposed to\r\nbe on or near the 35th degree of north latitude,[58] whereas it was\r\nactually more than 20 miles to the north of that parallel and about\r\n10 miles to the north of the present boundary of South Carolina. The\r\ndefinite establishment of this treaty line of 1785 in this quarter,\r\nhowever, became unnecessary by reason of the ratification in February,\r\n1792, of the Cherokee treaty concluded July 2, 1791,[59] wherein the\r\nIndian boundary line was withdrawn a considerable distance to the west.\r\n\r\n9. The line along the \"South Carolina Indian boundary\" ran in a\r\nsouthwesterly direction from the point of contact with the prolongation\r\nof Hardin's line, passing over \"Ocunna\" Mountain a short distance to\r\nthe northwestwardly of Oconee Station and striking the Tugaloo River at\r\na point about 1 mile above the mouth of Panther Creek.[58]\r\n\r\n10. The line from Tugaloo River pursued a west of south course to\r\nCurrahee Mountain, which is the southern terminus of a spur of the\r\nAlleghany Mountains, and is situated 4 miles southwest of \"Toccoa\r\nFalls\" and 16 miles northwest of Carnesville, Georgia.\r\n\r\n11. From \"Currahee Mountain to the head of the south fork of Oconee\r\nRiver,\" the line pursued a course south 38° west[58] to the source of\r\nthat stream, now commonly known as the Appallachee River, and was the\r\nterminal point of the boundary as defined in this treaty. This line was\r\nsurveyed in 1798[60] under the direction of Col. Benj. Hawkins.\r\n\r\nIt is also a pertinent fact in connection with the boundaries defined\r\nby this treaty (as already stated in connection with Henderson's\r\ntreaty), that although a literal reading of the description contained\r\nin Henderson's \"Great Grant\" of 1775 would include all the country\r\nwatered by the tributaries of the Cumberland, the commissioners\r\nwho negotiated this treaty of Hopewell in 1785 did not consider\r\nHenderson's Purchase as extending south of the Cumberland River proper,\r\nexcept in its course from Powell's Mountain to the head of the most\r\nsouthwardly branch of that river. This branch was considered by these\r\ncommissioners of 1785 as being the Yellow River, whose source was at\r\nbest but imperfectly known. They specifically state that they accept\r\nthe boundaries of Henderson's Purchase in this direction,[61] and as\r\nthe boundary defined by them between Powell's Mountain and Yellow River\r\nwas \"Campbell's line,\" they must have considered that line as being the\r\nsouthern limit of Henderson's Great Grant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In pocket at the end of volume.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: I am informed by Colonel Bushyhead, principal chief of the\r\nCherokee Nation, that Bartram is mistaken in his latter assumption.\r\nThe letter \"r\" was never used except among the Overhill Cherokees, and\r\noccurred very infrequently with them.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The full title of this work is \"Descriptionis Ptolemaicæ\r\nAugmentum; sive Occidentis Notitia, brevi commentario illustrata,\r\nstudio et opera, Cornely Wytfliet, Louaniensis.

On the part\r\nof the former the chief cause of complaint was the non-removal of the\r\nsettlers in the fork of the French Broad and Holston Rivers and their\r\nevident disposition to encroach still farther into the Indian country\r\nat every opportunity. The whites, on the other hand, were discontented\r\nbecause further curtailment of the Cherokee territory had not been\r\ncompelled by the commissioners who negotiated the treaty, and the State\r\nauthorities of North Carolina and Georgia had protested because of the\r\nalleged interference by the General Government with the reserved rights\r\nof the States.[63] In retaliation for the intrusions of the whites the\r\nIndians were continually engaged in pilfering their stock and other\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nThe state of affairs resulting from this continual friction rendered\r\nsome decisive action by Congress necessary. A large portion of the\r\nland in Greene and Hawkins Counties, Tennessee, had been entered by\r\nthe settlers under the laws of North Carolina, whereby she had assumed\r\njurisdiction to the Mississippi River.[64] These lands were south and\r\nwest of the treaty line of 1785, as were also the lands on the west\r\nside of the Clinch upon which settlements had been made. Settlers to\r\nthe number of several thousand, south of the French Broad and Holston,\r\nwere also within the Cherokee limits.[65]\r\n\r\nIt is true that the authorities of the so-called State of Franklin had\r\nin the years 1785 and 1786 negotiated two treaties with the Cherokees,\r\nobtaining cessions from the latter covering most, if not all, of these\r\nlands,[66] but neither the State of North Carolina nor the United\r\nStates recognized these treaties as of any force or validity.\r\n\r\nThese trespasses called forth under date of September 1, 1788,\r\na proclamation from Congress forbidding all such unwarrantable\r\nintrusions, and enjoining all those who had settled upon the hunting\r\nground of the Cherokees to depart with their families and effects\r\nwithout loss of time.\r\n\r\nGeneral Knox, Secretary of War, under date of July 7, 1789, in a\r\ncommunication to the President, remarked that \"the disgraceful\r\nviolation of the treaty of Hopewell with the Cherokees requires the\r\nserious consideration of Congress. If so direct and manifest contempt\r\nof the authority of the United States be suffered with impunity,\r\nit will be in vain to attempt to extend the arm of government to\r\nthe frontiers. The Indian tribes can have no faith in such imbecile\r\npromises, and the lawless whites will ridicule a government which\r\nshall, on paper only, make Indian treaties and regulate Indian\r\nboundaries.\"[67]\r\n\r\nHe recommended the appointment of three commissioners on the part of\r\nthe United States, who should be invested with full powers to examine\r\ninto the case of the Cherokees and to renew with them the treaty made\r\nat Hopewell in 1785; also to report to the President such measures as\r\nshould be necessary to protect the Indians in the boundaries secured to\r\nthem by that treaty, which he suggested would involve the establishment\r\nof military posts within the Indian country and the services of at\r\nleast five hundred troops. President Washington, on the same day,\r\ntransmitted the report of the Secretary of War, with the accompanying\r\npapers, to Congress. He approved of the recommendations of General\r\nKnox, and urged upon that body prompt action in the matter.\r\n\r\nCongress, however, failed to take any decisive action at that session,\r\nand on the 11th of August, 1790, President Washington again brought the\r\nsubject to the attention of that body. After reciting the substance of\r\nhis previous communication, he added that, notwithstanding the treaty\r\nof Hopewell and the proclamation of Congress, upwards of five hundred\r\nfamilies had settled upon the Cherokee lands, exclusive of those\r\nbetween the fork of the French Broad and Holston Rivers.[68] He further\r\nadded that, as the obstructions to a proper conduct of the matter had\r\nbeen removed since his previous communication, by the accession of\r\nNorth Carolina to the Union and the cession to the United States by\r\nher of the lands in question,[69] he should conceive himself bound to\r\nexert the powers intrusted to him by the Constitution in order to carry\r\ninto faithful execution the treaty of Hopewell, unless it should be\r\nthought proper to attempt to arrange a new boundary with the Cherokees,\r\nembracing the settlements and compensating the Cherokees for the\r\ncessions they should make.\r\n\r\n_United States Senate authorizes a new treaty._--Upon the reception of\r\nthis message the Senate adopted a resolution advising and consenting\r\nthat the President should, at his discretion, cause the treaty of\r\nHopewell to be carried into execution or enter into arrangements\r\nfor such further cession of territory from the Cherokees as the\r\ntranquillity and interests of the United States should require. A\r\nproviso to this resolution limited the compensation to be paid to the\r\nCherokees for such further cession to $1,000 per annum and stipulated\r\nthat no person who had taken possession of any lands within the limits\r\nof the proposed cession should be confirmed therein until he had\r\ncomplied with such terms as Congress should thereafter prescribe.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, instructions were issued to William Blount, governor of\r\nthe Territory south of the Ohio River and _ex-officio_ superintendent\r\nof Indian affairs, to conclude a treaty of cession with the\r\nCherokees.[70]\r\n\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE COMPANY'S PURCHASE.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the troubles between the Indians and the settlers had\r\nbecome aggravated from divers causes. Prominent among these was the\r\nfact that Georgia had by act of her legislature disposed of 3,500,000\r\nacres of vacant land lying south of Tennessee River to the Tennessee\r\nCompany. This association undertook to effect a settlement in the year\r\n1791 at or near the Muscle Shoals.[71] The matter coming to the notice\r\nof the Secretary of War was made the subject of a strong protest by him\r\nto the President.[72]\r\n\r\nThe latter issued his proclamation forbidding such settlement. The\r\ncompany persisted in the attempt, and as the President had declared\r\nsuch act would place them without the protection of the United States,\r\nthe Indians were left free to break up and destroy the settlement,\r\nwhich they did.[73]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIFFICULTIES IN NEGOTIATING NEW TREATY.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of Governor Blount's instructions, he convened the Indians\r\nat White's Fort, on the present site of Knoxville, Tenn.; and after a\r\nconference lasting seven days, succeeded, with much difficulty and with\r\ngreat reluctance on the part of the Cherokees, in concluding the treaty\r\nof July 2, 1791.[74]\r\n\r\nIn his letter to the Secretary of War,[75] transmitting the treaty, he\r\nasserts the greatest difficulty to have been in agreeing on a boundary,\r\nand that the one fixed upon might seem singular. The reason for this\r\npeculiarity of description was owing to the fact that the Indians\r\ninsisted on beginning on the part where they were most tenacious of\r\nthe land, in preference to the mouth of Duck River, where the Hopewell\r\ntreaty line began. The land to the right of the line was declared to\r\nbelong to the United States, because no given point of the compass\r\nwould describe it. In accordance with his instructions, Governor\r\nBlount proposed to the Indians that the ridge dividing the waters of\r\nLittle River from those of the Tennessee should form a part of the\r\nboundary. To this the Indians would not agree, but insisted on the\r\nstraight line which should cross the Holston where that ridge should\r\nstrike it. Governor Blount explains that this line is not so limited\r\nby the treaty as to the point at which it shall leave the north line\r\nor at which it shall strike the Clinch, but that it might be so run as\r\neither to include or leave out the settlers south of the ridge; the\r\nonly stipulations respecting it being that it should cross the Holston\r\nat the ridge, and should be run by commissioners appointed by the\r\nrespective parties.\r\n\r\nHe urged that the line should be run immediately after the ratification\r\nof the treaty, as settlers were already located in the immediate\r\nvicinity of it, and more were preparing to follow.\r\n\r\nThe President transmitted the treaty to the Senate with his message of\r\nOctober 26, 1791,[76] and Senator Hawkins, from the committee to whom\r\nit was referred, reported it back to the Senate on the 9th of November\r\nfollowing, recommending that the Senate advise and consent to its\r\nratification.[77]\r\n\r\nOn the 19th of the same month the Secretary of War advised Governor\r\nBlount that the treaty had been ratified by the President, by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate, and inclosed him 50 printed\r\ncopies for distribution, although the United States Statutes at Large\r\n[Vol. VII, p. 39] give the date of the proclamation of the treaty as\r\nFebruary 7, 1792.[78]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: American State Papers, Indian Affairs, Vol. I, p. 44.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 64: Protest of Col.

Landon Carter as\r\ncommissioners to superintend the same. This suggestion was subsequently\r\nmodified by the appointment of Charles McLung and John McKee in place\r\nof Smith and Carter. Governor Blount designated the 1st of May as\r\nthe date for the survey to commence. Andrew Ellicott was appointed\r\nsurveyor, he having been previously appointed to survey the line\r\nunder the Creek treaty of 1790.[79] Before these arrangements could\r\nbe carried out, the Secretary of War again wrote Governor Blount,[80]\r\nremarking that while it was important the line should be run, yet\r\nas the United States, in their military operations, might want the\r\nassistance of the Cherokees, perhaps it would be better policy to\r\nhave the lines ascertained and marked after rather than before the\r\ncampaign then about to commence against the Indians northwest of the\r\nOhio.[81] It was thus determined, in view of numerous individual acts\r\nof hostility on the part of the Cherokees and of the desire to soothe\r\nthem into peace and to engage them as auxiliaries against the northern\r\nIndians, to temporarily postpone the running of the line.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable correspondence between Governor Blount and the\r\nCherokee chiefs in council, the 8th of October, 1792, was fixed upon\r\nas the date for the meeting of the representatives of both parties\r\nat Major Craig's, on Nine-Mile Creek, for the purpose of beginning\r\nthe survey.[82] In the mean time an increased spirit of hostility had\r\nbecome manifest among the Cherokees and Creeks, the five lower towns of\r\nthe former having declared war, and an Indian invasion of the frontier\r\nseemed imminent. Governor Blount, therefore, in the latter part of\r\nSeptember,[83] deemed it wise to call fifteen companies of militia\r\ninto immediate service, under the command of General Sevier, for the\r\nprotection of the settlements. Notwithstanding this critical condition\r\nof affairs, the boundary line commissioners on the part of the United\r\nStates assembled at the appointed time and place. After waiting until\r\nthe following day, the representatives of the Cherokees putting in no\r\nappearance, they proceeded to inspect the supposed route of the treaty\r\nline. After careful examination they came to the conclusion that the\r\nridge dividing the waters of Tennessee and Little Rivers struck the\r\nHolston River at the mouth and at no other point.[84]\r\n\r\nThey then proceeded to run, but did not mark, a line of experiment from\r\nthe point of the ridge in a southeast direction to Chilhowee Mountain,\r\na distance of 17-1/2 miles, and also from the point of beginning in\r\na northwest direction to the Clinch River, a distance of 9 miles.\r\nFrom these observations they found that the line, continued to the\r\nsoutheast, would intersect the Tennessee River shortly after it crossed\r\nthe Chilhowee Mountain, and in consequence would deprive the Indians\r\nof all their towns lying on the south side of the Tennessee. This\r\nrendered apparent the necessity of changing the direction of the line\r\ninto a more nearly east and west course, and led the commissioners to\r\nexpress the opinion that the true line should run from the point of the\r\nridge south 60° east to Chilhowee Mountain and north 60° west to the\r\nClinch.\r\n\r\nThe course thus designated left a number of the settlers on Nine-Mile\r\nCreek within the Indian limits.[85]\r\n\r\nThe records of the War Department having been almost completely\r\ndestroyed by fire in the month of November, 1800, it is with great\r\ndifficulty that definite data can be obtained concerning the survey of\r\nthis and other Indian boundaries prior to that date. It has, however,\r\nbeen ascertained that the above mentioned line was not actually\r\nsurveyed until the year 1797.\r\n\r\n_Journal of Col. Benjamin Hawkins._--The manuscript journal of Col.\r\nBenjamin Hawkins, now in the possession of the Historical Society of\r\nGeorgia, shows that instructions were issued by the Secretary of War\r\non the 2d of February, 1797, appointing and directing Col. Benjamin\r\nHawkins, General Andrew Pickens, and General James Winchester as\r\ncommissioners on the part of the United States to establish and mark\r\nthe lines between the latter and the Indian nations south of the Ohio.\r\nThese instructions reached Colonel Hawkins at Fort Fidius, on the\r\nOconee, on the 28th of February. Notice was at once sent to General\r\nPickens at his residence at Hopewell, on the Keowee, and also to\r\nGeneral Winchester, through Silas Dinsmoor, at that time temporary\r\nagent for the Cherokee Nation, to convene at Tellico, on Tennessee\r\nRiver, on the 1st of April following, for the purpose of determining\r\nand marking the Cherokee boundary line pursuant to the treaty of\r\n1791. Colonel Hawkins joined General Pickens at Hopewell, from which\r\npoint they set out for Tellico on the 23d of March, accompanied by\r\nJoseph Whitner, one of their surveyors, as well as by an escort of\r\nUnited States troops, furnished by Lieut. Col. Henry Gaither. Passing\r\nOcunna station, they were joined by their other surveyor, John Clark\r\nKilpatrick. They reached Tellico block-house on the 31st of March, and\r\nwere joined on the following day by Mr. Dinsmoor, the Cherokee agent.\r\nHere they were visited by Hon. David Campbell, who, in conjunction\r\nwith Charles McLung and John McKee, had been appointed in 1792, as\r\npreviously set forth, to survey and mark the line. Mr. Campbell\r\ninformed them that he and his co-commissioners, in pursuance of their\r\ninstructions, did in part ascertain and establish the boundary and\r\nreport the same to Governor Blount, and that he would accompany the\r\npresent commissioners and give them all the information he possessed\r\non the subject. About the same time confidential information was\r\nreceived that General Winchester would not attend the meeting of his\r\nco-commissioners, and that this was understood to be in pursuance of a\r\nscheme to postpone the running of the line in the interest of certain\r\nintruders upon Indian land. On the 7th of April the commissioners set\r\nout to examine the location and direction of the ridge dividing the\r\nwaters of Little River from those of Tennessee, at the same time noting\r\nthat \"we received information that the line run between the Indians and\r\nwhite inhabitants by the commissioners, mentioned on the 3d instant by\r\nMr. Campbell, was by order, for the express purpose of ascertaining\r\na line of accommodation for the white settlers, who were then over\r\nthe treaty line.\" By arrangement they met a number of the interested\r\nsettlers at the house of Mr. Bartlett McGee on the 9th, and by them\r\nwere advised that the ridge between the sources of Nine-Mile, Baker's,\r\nPistol, and Crooked Creeks \"is that which divides the waters running\r\ninto Little River from those running into the Tennessee.\"\r\n\r\nProceeding with their observations, they set out for the point on this\r\nridge \"where the experiment line for fixing the court-house of Blount\r\nCounty passes the ridge between Pistol Creek and Baker's Creek, due\r\neast from a point on the Tennessee 13-1/2 miles, and this point on the\r\nTennessee is 1-1/2 miles south from a point from where a line west\r\njoins the confluence of the Holston and Tennessee.\" The point on the\r\nridge here spoken of was 2-1/2 miles north of Bartlett McGee's and 1\r\nmile north of the source of Nine-Mile Creek. The commissioners state\r\nthat in noting observations they count distances in minutes, at the\r\nrate of 60' to 3 miles. From the foregoing point they proceeded west 8'\r\nto a ridge dividing Pistol and Baker's Creeks; turned south 6' to the\r\ntop of a knoll, having on the right the falling grounds of Gallagher's\r\nCreek. This knoll they called \"Iron Hill.\" Continuing south 11', they\r\ncrossed a small ridge and ascended a hill 4' SSW., crossing a path from\r\nBaker's Creek to the settlements on Holston. From here the ridge bore\r\nSSW. 1 mile, SW. by W. 1 mile, SSW. 3 miles, and thence NW., which\r\nwould make it strike the Holston River near the mouth of that stream.\r\nThis corresponded with the observations of the previous commissioners\r\nwho had run the experimental line.\r\n\r\nThis inspection convinced the commissioners that a considerable number\r\nof the white settlers were on the Indian land. The latter were quite\r\nanxious that some arrangement should be made for their accommodation in\r\nthe coming conference with the Indians, but received no encouragement\r\nfrom the commissioners further than an assurance that they should be\r\npermitted to gather their crops of small grain and fruit before removal.\r\n\r\nBeing asked by the commissioners why the line run by Mr. Campbell\r\nand his confrères was known by three names, \"that of experience, of\r\nexperiment, and the treaty line with the Indians,\" they answered that\r\n\"it was not the treaty line, but a line run to see how the citizens\r\ncould be covered, as they were then settled on the frontier; that they\r\nunderstood this to be the direction to the commissioners, and that\r\nthey conformed to it and ran the line as we had noticed in viewing the\r\nlands between the two rivers.\" The settlers also said, \"the law, as\r\nthey were likely to be affected, had been incautiously worded. They\r\nunderstood from it that the line from Clinch to cross the Holston at\r\nthe ridge would turn thence south to the South Carolina Indian boundary\r\non the North Carolina line. We replied that this understanding of it\r\nwas erroneous. There was no such course in the treaty, and they should\r\nnever suppose that the Government would be capable of violating a\r\nsolemn guarantee; that, although the expression was 'thence south,' yet\r\nit must be understood as meaning southeastwardly, to the point next\r\ncalled for, as the point is in that direction and far to the east; that\r\nthe lands in question had moreover been expressly reserved by the State\r\nof North Carolina for the Indians, and the occupants had not, as some\r\nothers had, even the plea of entry in the land office of that State.\"\r\n\r\nThe law referred to above by the settlers and the commissioners was the\r\nact of Congress approved May 19, 1796, entitled \"An act to regulate\r\ntrade and intercourse with the Indian tribes and to preserve peace on\r\nthe frontiers.\" This act recited the course of the Indian boundary as\r\nestablished by treaty with the various tribes extending from the mouth\r\nof Cuyahoga River along the line described in the treaty of 1795 at\r\nGreenville, to the Ohio River and down the same to the ridge dividing\r\nthe Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers; thence, up and along said ridge\r\nand continuing according to the Cherokee treaty of 1791 to the river\r\nClinch; \"thence down said river to a point from which a line shall pass\r\nthe Holston, at the ridge which divides the waters running into Little\r\nRiver from those running into the Tennessee; thence _south_ to the\r\nNorth Carolina boundary,\" etc.\r\n\r\nOwing to fears for their personal safety caused by the hostile tone\r\nof the settlers toward them, it was not until the 25th of April that\r\na representative delegation of the Cherokees was convened in council\r\nby the commissioners. There were present 147 chiefs and warriors.\r\nCommissioners were appointed by them to act on behalf of their nation,\r\nin conjunction with those on behalf the United States, to run and mark\r\nthe boundary line, and an agreement was reached that Messrs. Hawkins\r\nand Pickens should have authority to select the necessary sites for the\r\nproposed military posts within their country.\r\n\r\nDuring the council a delegation of the intruding settlers presented\r\nthemselves but were not allowed to attend the deliberations, being\r\nadvised by the commissioners \"that it was not in contemplation to make\r\na new treaty but to carry the treaty of Holston into effect; that\r\nwe did not expect much light on this subject from the Indians; that\r\nwe should form our decision from the instrument itself and not from\r\ninterested reporters on either side; that all who were on the Indian\r\nlands could not be relieved by us; * * * that he (Captain Henly) and\r\nmost of the deputation lived on this side of the line of experiment,\r\nand that they had informed us that that line was merely to ascertain\r\nhow the citizens could be accommodated and _on this side of the true\r\nline_ intended in the treaty; that to accommodate them a new treaty\r\nmust be had and a new line agreed on, and, in our opinion, at this time\r\nit could not be effected; that the Indians were much alarmed for their\r\nsituation, and viewed every attempt to acquire land as a violation of\r\nthe solemn guaranty of the Government; that we need not expect ever\r\nto obtain fairly their consent to part with their land, unless our\r\nfellow-citizens would pay more respect than we saw they did to their\r\ntreaties.\r\n\r\nFollowing this conference with the Indians, the commissioners proceeded\r\n(examining the country carefully en route) to South West Point, at the\r\nmouth of Clinch River, which they reached on the 6th of May, and the\r\njournal of Colonel Hawkins concludes with this day's proceedings. It\r\nis learned, however, from an old map of the line now on file in the\r\noffice of Indian Affairs, that the survey was not begun until more than\r\nthree months after their arrival at South West Point. From another map\r\nin the same office it appears that the line as surveyed extended from\r\na point about 1,000 yards above South West Point in a course S. 76° E.\r\nto the Great Iron Mountain, and was known as \"Hawkins Line.\"[86] From\r\nthis point the line continued in the same course until it reached the\r\ntreaty line of 1785, and was called \"Pickens Line.\" The supposition\r\nis that as the commissioners were provided with two surveyors, they\r\nseparated, Colonel Hawkins with Mr. Whitner as surveyor running the\r\nline from Clinch River to the Great Iron Mountains, and General Pickens\r\nwith Colonel Kilpatrick as surveyor locating the remainder of it. This\r\nsupposition is verified so far as General Pickens is concerned by his\r\nown written statement.[87]\r\n\r\nFrom the point where it struck the Clinch River, the line of cession\r\nby this treaty of 1791 followed up the course of that river until it\r\nstruck Campbell's line at a point 3 or 4 miles southwest of the present\r\ntown of Sneedville. From this point it became identical with the\r\nboundary line prescribed by the treaty of November 28, 1785 at Hopewell.\r\n\r\nThe tract of country ceded by this treaty comprised the territory\r\nwithin the present limits of Sevier, Cocke, Jefferson, Hamblen,\r\nGrainger, and almost the entirety of Knox, as well as portions\r\nof Roane, Loudon, Anderson, Union, Hancock, Hawkins, Sullivan,\r\nWashington, Greene, and Blount Counties in Tennessee, together with a\r\nportion of North Carolina lying principally west of the French Broad\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Ib., p. 628-630.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: January 31, 1792. See American State Papers, Indian\r\nAffairs, Vol. I, p. 629.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: It may not be uninteresting as a historical incident\r\nto note the fact that at the time of General Wayne's treaty at\r\nGreeneville, in 1795, a band of Cherokees had settled on the\r\nhead-waters of the Scioto River in Ohio. Not presenting themselves\r\nat the conferences preceding that treaty, General Wayne sent them a\r\nspecial message through Captain Long Hair, one of their chiefs, with\r\nthe information that if they failed to conclude articles of peace with\r\nhim they would be left unprotected. They sent a delegation to assure\r\nGeneral Wayne of their desire for peace, saying that as soon as they\r\ngathered their crop of corn they would return to their tribe, which\r\nthey did.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: American State Papers.

That the annual sum to be paid to the Cherokees by the United\r\nStates, in consideration of the relinquishment of lands, made in treaty\r\nof 1791, be $1,500 instead of $1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCONTENT OF THE CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nAs stated in considering the treaty of July 2, 1791, the Secretary of\r\nWar notified Governor Blount[88] that the President had ratified the\r\nsame, and inclosed printed copies thereof to him for distribution. This\r\nwas equivalent to its official promulgation, although the treaty as\r\nprinted in the United States Statutes at Large gives February 17, 1792,\r\nas the date of proclamation.\r\n\r\nBut, whichever may be the correct date, during the interval elapsing\r\nbetween them, a Cherokee delegation, without the invitation or\r\nknowledge of the United States authorities, proceeded to Philadelphia\r\n(then the seat of Government), where they arrived on the 28th of\r\nDecember, 1791, bringing with them from Governor Pinckney and General\r\nPickens, of South Carolina, evidence of the authenticity of their\r\nmission.[89]\r\n\r\nThe delegation consisted of six, besides the interpreter, and was\r\nheaded by Nen-e-too-yah, or the Bloody Fellow. They were kindly\r\nreceived by the President, who directed the Secretary of War to\r\nascertain their business.\r\n\r\nConferences were thereupon held with them, lasting several days, at\r\nwhich the Indians detailed at great length their grievances and made\r\nknown their wants.\r\n\r\n_Causes of complaint._--The substance of their communications was to\r\nthe effect that when they were summoned by Governor Blount to the\r\nconference which resulted in the treaty of July 2, 1791, they were\r\nunaware of any purpose on the part of the Government to secure any\r\nfurther cession of land from them; that they had protested vigorously\r\nand consistently for several days against yielding any more territory,\r\nbut were met with such persistent and threatening demands from Governor\r\nBlount on the subject that they were forced to yield; that they had no\r\nconfidence that the North Carolinians would attach any sacredness to\r\nthe new boundary, in fact they were already settling beyond it; and\r\nthat the annuity stipulated in the treaty of 1791, as compensation for\r\nthe cession, was entirely inadequate. They therefore asked an increase\r\nof the annuity from $1,000 to $1,500, and furthermore demanded that the\r\nwhite people who had settled south of the ridge dividing the waters of\r\nLittle River from those of the Tennessee should be removed, and that\r\nsuch ridge should be the barrier.\r\n\r\nPresident Washington, believing their demand to be a just one, and also\r\ndesiring that the delegation should carry home a favorable report of\r\nthe attitude and disposition of the Government toward them, submitted\r\nthe matter to the Senate[90] and requested the advice of that body as\r\nto the propriety of attaching an additional article to the treaty of\r\n1791 which should increase the annuity from $1,000 to $1,500.\r\n\r\n_Annuity increased._--To this proposition the Senate gave its advice\r\nand consent,[91] and what is mentioned in the United States Statutes\r\nat Large as a treaty concluded and proclaimed February 17, 1792,[92]\r\nbecame the law of the land.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAR WITH CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nThis concession did not, however, in any large degree heal the\r\ndifferences and antagonisms existing between the Indians and the border\r\nsettlers, with whom they were brought in constant contact. Even while\r\nthe treaty of 1792 was being negotiated by the representatives of\r\nthe Cherokees at the capital of the nation, a portion of their young\r\nwarriors were consummating arrangements for the precipitation of a\r\ngeneral war with the whites, and in September, 1792, a party of upwards\r\nof 700 Cherokee and Creek warriors attacked Buchanan's Station, Tenn.,\r\nwithin 4 miles of Nashville. They were headed by the Cherokee chief\r\nJohn Watts, who was one of the signers of the treaty of Holston, and\r\nhad he not been severely wounded early in the attack, it is likely the\r\nstation would have been destroyed.[93]\r\n\r\nA year later, between twelve and fifteen hundred Indians of the\r\nsame tribes invaded the settlements on the Holston River and\r\ndestroyed Cavitt's Station, 7 miles below Knoxville.[94] In fact,\r\nthe intermediate periods between 1791 and 1795 were filled up by the\r\nincursions of smaller war parties, and it was not until the latter\r\nyear that the frontiers found any repose from Indian depredations.\r\n\r\nThe general tranquillity enjoyed after that date seems to have been\r\noccasioned by the wholesome discipline administered to the tribes\r\nnorthwest of the Ohio by General Wayne, in his victory of August 20,\r\n1794, and as a result of the expedition of Major Ore, with his command\r\nof Tennesseeans and Kentuckians, in September of the same year, against\r\nthe Lower Towns of the Cherokees, wherein two of those towns, Running\r\nWater and Nickajack, were destroyed.[95]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: November 19, 1791.

The treaty of July 2, 1791, declared to be in full force in respect\r\nto the boundaries, as well as in all other respects whatever.\r\n\r\n2. The boundaries mentioned in the 4th article of treaty of July 2,\r\n1791, to be ascertained and marked after ninety days' notice shall have\r\nbeen given to the Cherokee Nation of the time and place of commencing\r\nthe operation by the United States commissioners.\r\n\r\n3. The United States agree, in lieu of all former sums, to furnish the\r\nCherokees with $5,000 worth of goods annually, as compensation for all\r\nterritory ceded by treaties of November 28, 1785, and July 2, 1791.\r\n\r\n4. Fifty dollars to be deducted from Cherokee annuity for every horse\r\nstolen by Cherokees from whites and not returned within three months.\r\n\r\n5. These articles to be considered as additions to treaty of July 2,\r\n1791, as soon as ratified by the President and Senate of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLAINTS CONCERNING BOUNDARIES.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the official records renders it very difficult to\r\nascertain the details of the misunderstandings alleged in the preamble\r\nof this treaty of June 26, 1794,[97] to have arisen concerning the\r\nprovisions of the treaty of 1791. But it is gathered from various\r\nsources that the principal cause of complaint was in reference to\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nAfter that treaty was concluded, however, it became evident that there\r\nwould be difficulty in determining satisfactorily where the ridge came\r\nin contact with the Holston, inasmuch as the white settlers in the\r\nvicinity could not agree upon it. The Indians also changed their minds\r\nin some respect as to the proper course of the line; but, in view of\r\nthe fact that settlers were encroaching with great persistency upon\r\ntheir territory, they saw the necessity of taking immediate steps to\r\nhave the boundary officially surveyed and marked. They also revived an\r\nold claim to pay for lands yielded by them in the establishment of the\r\ntreaty line of 1785, for which they had received no compensation.\r\n\r\n_Increase of annuity._--In the conference preceding the signature of\r\nthis treaty of 1794 they insisted that for this and other reasons an\r\nincrease should be made in the annuity provided by the treaty of 1791,\r\nas amended by that of 1792. This was agreed to by the United States,\r\nand the annuity was increased from $1,500 to $5,000.\r\n\r\n_Boundary line to be surveyed._--It was also agreed that the treaty\r\nline of 1791 should be promptly surveyed and marked after ninety days'\r\nnotice had been given to the Cherokees of the time when and the place\r\nwhere the survey should begin.\r\n\r\nThis, as has already been stated in connection with the treaty of\r\n1791, had been so far performed in the fall of 1792 as to run but not\r\nmark a preliminary line for a short portion of the distance, but in\r\nspite of the additional agreement in this treaty of 1794 the actual\r\nand final survey did not take place until 1797,[100] three years after\r\nthe conclusion of this treaty and more than seven years after it was\r\noriginally promised to be done.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of 1794 was concluded by the Secretary of War himself with\r\na delegation of the Cherokees who had visited Philadelphia for that\r\npurpose. It was communicated by President Washington to the Senate on\r\nthe 30th of December, 1794.[101]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEE HOSTILITIES.\r\n\r\nWhile this treaty was being negotiated, and for some months thereafter,\r\na portion of the Cherokees were engaged in the bitterest hostilities\r\nagainst the white settlements, which were only brought to a close, as\r\nhas been incidentally remarked in discussing the treaty of 1792, by the\r\nexpedition of Major Ore against the Lower Cherokee towns in September,\r\n1794.\r\n\r\n_Peace conference._--Following this expedition the hostile Cherokees\r\nsued for peace, and at their request a conference was held with them by\r\nGovernor Blount, at Tellico Block House, on the 7th and 8th of November\r\nof that year.[102]\r\n\r\nThis council was attended by Col. John Watts, of Willstown, principal\r\nleader of the hostiles; Scolacutta, or the Hanging Maw, head chief\r\nof the nation, and four hundred other chiefs and warriors. A general\r\ndisposition seemed to be manifested among them to abandon their habits\r\nof depredation and secure for themselves and their families that\r\npeace to which they, as well as their white neighbors, had long been\r\nstrangers. Governor Blount met them in a friendly spirit and sought, by\r\nevery means in his power, to confirm them in their good disposition.\r\n\r\nIn reporting the facts of this conference to the Secretary of War he\r\nasserted one of the most fruitful causes of friction between the whites\r\nand Indians to be the stealing and selling of horses by the latter,\r\nfor which they could always find a ready and unquestioned market among\r\nunscrupulous whites. As measures of frontier protection he suggested\r\nthe continuance of the three military garrisons of Southwest Point at\r\nthe mouth of the Clinch, of Fort Granger at the mouth of the Holston,\r\nand of Tellico Block House, opposite the remains of old Fort Loudon,\r\nand also the erection of a military post, if the Cherokees would permit\r\nit, on the north bank of the Tennessee, nearly opposite the mouth of\r\nLookout Mountain Creek. Subsequently[103] he held a further conference\r\nwith the Cherokees and endeavored to foster hostilities between them\r\nand the Creeks by urging the organization of a company of their young\r\nwarriors to patrol the frontiers of Mero District for its protection\r\nagainst incursions of the Creeks. To this the leading Cherokee chiefs\r\nrefused assent, not because of any objection to the proposition, but\r\nbecause they desired time for preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERCOURSE ACT OF 1796.\r\n\r\nEarly in the following year[104] President Washington, in an emphatic\r\nmessage, laid before Congress a communication from Governor Blount\r\nsetting forth, the determination of a large combination of persons\r\nto take possession of certain Indian lands south and southwest of\r\nthe Cumberland, under the pretended authority of certain acts of the\r\nlegislature of North Carolina, passed some years previous, for the\r\nrelief of her officers and soldiers of the Continental line.\r\n\r\nIn view of the injustice of such intrusions and the mischievous\r\nconsequences which would of necessity result therefrom, the President\r\nrecommended that effective provision should be made to prevent them.\r\n\r\nThis eventuated in the passage of the act of Congress, approved May 19,\r\n1796,[105] providing for the government of intercourse between citizens\r\nof the United States and the various Indian tribes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: Report of Maj. James Ore to Governor Blount, September\r\n24, 1794. He left Nashville September 7, with 550 mounted infantry,\r\ncrossed the Tennessee on the 12th, about 4 miles below Nickajack, and\r\non the morning of the 13th destroyed Nickajack and Running Water towns,\r\nkilling upwards of 50 and making a number prisoners. See American State\r\nPapers, Indian Affairs, Vol. I, p. 632.]\r\n\r\nAt the treaty of 1791, Governor Blount, as he alleges, sought, by every\r\nmeans in his power, to have the boundary of the cession follow, so far\r\nas might be, the natural barrier formed by the dividing ridge between\r\nthe waters of Little River and those of the Tennessee,[98] and such\r\nin fact was the tenor of his instructions from the Secretary of War;\r\nbut the Indian chiefs unanimously insisted that the boundary should be\r\na straight line, running from the point where the ridge in question\r\nshould strike the Holston, and assumed as evidence of the crookedness\r\nof Governor Blount's heart the fact that he desired to run a crooked\r\nline.[99]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 43.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: American State Papers, Indian Affairs, Vol. I, p. 629.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: Letter of Governor Blount to Secretary of War, March 2,\r\n1792.

Col. Thomas Butler, commissioners on\r\n    behalf of the United States, and the chiefs and warriors of the\r\n    Cherokee Nation._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nOwing to misunderstandings and consequent delay in running the boundary\r\nline prescribed by the treaties of 1791 and 1794, and the ignorant\r\nencroachment of settlers on the Indian lands within the limits of such\r\nboundaries before their survey, it became desirable that the Indians\r\nshould cede more land. The following treaty was therefore concluded:\r\n\r\n1. Peace and friendship are renewed and declared perpetual.\r\n\r\n2. Previous treaties acknowledged to be of binding force.\r\n\r\n3. Boundaries of the Cherokees to remain the same where not altered by\r\nthis treaty.\r\n\r\n4. The Cherokees cede to the United States all lands within the\r\nfollowing points and lines, viz: From a point on the Tennessee River,\r\nbelow Tellico Block House, called the Wild Cat Rock, in a direct line\r\nto the Militia Spring near the Maryville road leading from Tellico.\r\nFrom the said spring to the Chill-howie Mountain by a line so to be\r\nrun as will leave all the farms on Nine Mile Creek to the northward\r\nand eastward of it, and to be continued along Chill-howie Mountain\r\nuntil it strikes Hawkins's line. Thence along said line to the Great\r\nIron Mountain, and from the top of which a line to be continued in a\r\nsoutheastwardly course to where the most southwardly branch of Little\r\nRiver crosses the divisional line to Tuggaloe River. From the place\r\nof beginning, the Wild Cat Rock, down the northeast margin of the\r\nTennessee River (not including islands) to a point one mile above the\r\njunction of that river with the Clinch, and from thence by a line to\r\nbe drawn in a right angle until it intersects Hawkins's line leading\r\nfrom Clinch. Thence down the said line to the river Clinch; thence\r\nup the said river to its junction with Emmery's River; thence up\r\nEmmery's River to the foot of Cumberland Mountain. From thence a line\r\nto be drawn, northeastwardly along the foot of the mountain until it\r\nintersects with Campbell's line.\r\n\r\n5. Two commissioners to be appointed (one by the United States and one\r\nby the Cherokees) to superintend the running and marking of the line,\r\nimmediately upon signing of the treaty, and three maps to be made after\r\nsurvey for use of the War Department, the State of Tennessee, and the\r\nCherokee Nation respectively.\r\n\r\n6. Upon signing the treaty the Cherokees to receive $5,000 cash and\r\nan annuity of $1,000, and the United States to guarantee them the\r\nremainder of their country forever.\r\n\r\n7. The United States to have free use of the Kentucky road running\r\nbetween Cumberland Mountain and river, in consideration of which the\r\nCherokees are permitted to hunt on ceded lands.\r\n\r\n8. Notice to be given the Cherokees of the time for delivering annual\r\nstipends.\r\n\r\n9. Horses stolen by either whites or Indians to be paid for at $60\r\neach (if by a white man, in cash; if by an Indian, to be deducted from\r\nannuity). All depredations prior to the beginning of these negotiations\r\nto be forgotten.\r\n\r\n10. The Cherokees agree that the United States agent shall have\r\nsufficient ground for his temporary use while residing among them.\r\nThis treaty to be binding and carried into effect by both sides when\r\nratified by the Senate and President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPUTES RESPECTING TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1797 the legislature of the State of Tennessee addressed a\r\nmemorial and remonstrance to Congress upon the subject of the Indian\r\ntitle to lands within that State. The burden of this complaint was\r\nthe assertion that the Indian title was at best nothing greater than\r\na tenancy at will; that the lands they occupied within the limits of\r\nthe State had been granted by the State of North Carolina, before the\r\nadmission of Tennessee to the Union, to her officers and soldiers of\r\nthe Continental line, and for other purposes; that the treaties entered\r\ninto with the Cherokees by the United States, guaranteeing them the\r\nexclusive possession of these lands, were subversive of State as well\r\nas individual vested rights, and praying that provision be made by law\r\nfor the extinguishment of the Indian claim.[107]\r\n\r\nThis was communicated to Congress by the President. Mr. Pinckney,\r\nfrom the committee of the House of Representatives to which the matter\r\nwas referred, submitted a report,[108] accompanied by a resolution\r\nmaking an appropriation for the relief of such citizens of the State\r\nof Tennessee as had a right to lands within that State, by virtue of\r\nthe cession out of the State of North Carolina, provided they had made\r\nactual settlement thereon and had been deprived of the possession\r\nthereof by the operation of the act of May 19, 1796, for regulating\r\nintercourse with the Indian tribes. The sum to be appropriated, it was\r\ndeclared, should be subject to the order of the President of the United\r\nStates, to be expended under his direction, either in extinguishing the\r\nIndian claim to the lands in question, by holding a treaty for that\r\npurpose, or to be disposed of in such other manner as he should deem\r\nbest calculated to afford the persons described a temporary relief.\r\n\r\n_New treaty._--The House of Representatives, on considering the\r\nsubject, passed a resolution directing the Secretary of War to lay\r\nbefore them such information as he possessed relative to the running of\r\na line of experiment from Clinch River to Chilhowie Mountain by order\r\nof Governor Blount, to which the Secretary responded on the 5th of\r\nJanuary, 1798.[109]\r\n\r\nFollowing this, on the 8th of the same month, President Adams\r\ncommunicated a message to the Senate, setting forth that the situation\r\nof affairs between some of the citizens of the United States and the\r\nCherokees had evinced the propriety of holding a treaty with that\r\nnation, to extinguish by purchase their right to certain parcels of\r\nland and to adjust and settle other points relative to the safety\r\nand convenience of the citizens of the United States. With this view\r\nhe nominated Fisher Ames, of Massachusetts, Bushrod Washington, of\r\nVirginia, and Alfred Moore, of North Carolina, to be commissioners,\r\nhaving authority to hold conferences and conclude a treaty with the\r\nCherokees for the purposes indicated.[110]\r\n\r\nThe Senate concurred in the advisability of the proposed treaty, but\r\nFisher Ames and Bushrod Washington having declined, George Walton and\r\nJohn Steele were associated with Mr. Moore, and detailed instructions\r\nwere given for their guidance.[111]\r\n\r\nBy these instructions they were vested jointly and severally with full\r\npowers to negotiate and conclude a treaty with the Cherokees, limited\r\nonly by the scope of the instructions themselves. The Cherokee agent\r\nhad already been directed to notify the Indians and the commandant of\r\nUnited States troops in Tennessee to furnish an escort sufficient for\r\nthe protection of the negotiations.\r\n\r\n_Further purchase of Cherokee lands proposed._--The commissioners\r\nwere directed as a primary consideration to secure, if possible, the\r\nconsent of the Cherokees to the sale of such part of their lands as\r\nwould give a more convenient form to the State of Tennessee and conduce\r\nto the protection of its citizens. Especially was it desirable to\r\nobtain their consent to the immediate return of such settlers as had\r\nintruded on their lands and in consequence had been removed by the\r\nUnited States troops, such consent to be predicated on the theory that\r\nthe Cherokees were willing to treat for the sale to the United States\r\nof the lands upon which these people had settled. They were directed to\r\nrenew the unsuccessful effort made by Governor Blount in 1791 to secure\r\nthe consent of the Cherokees that the boundary should begin at the\r\nmouth of Duck River and run up the middle of that stream to its source\r\nand thence by a line drawn to the mouth of Clinch River. The following\r\nalternative boundary propositions were directed to be submitted for the\r\nconsideration of the Indians, in their numerical order, viz:\r\n\r\n1. A line (represented on an accompanying map by a red dotted line)\r\nfrom a point on the ridge dividing the waters of the Cumberland from\r\nthe Tennessee River, in a southwest direction, until it should strike\r\nthe mouth of Duck River; thence from the mouth to the main source of\r\nthe river; thence by a line over the highest ridges of the Cumberland\r\nMountains to the mouth of Clinch River; thence down the middle of the\r\nTennessee River till it struck the divisional line under the treaties\r\nof 1791 and 1794; thence along said line to its crossing of the Cunchee\r\nCreek running into Tuckasegee; thence to the Great Iron Mountains;\r\nthence a southeasterly course to where the most southerly branch of\r\nLittle River crossed the divisional line to Tugaloo River.\r\n\r\n2. A line (represented on said map by a double red line) beginning at\r\nthe point 40 miles above Nashville, as ascertained by the commissioners\r\n(and laid down on said map); thence due east till it struck the dotted\r\nline on Cumberland Mountains; along said mountains to the junction of\r\nClinch and Tennessee Rivers; and down the Tennessee to the extent of\r\nthe boundary described in the first proposition.\r\n\r\n3. A line (dotted blue) beginning at a point 56 miles from the point 40\r\nmiles above Nashville, on the northeast divisional line, being 1-1/2\r\nmiles south of the road called Walton's or Caney Fork road; thence on\r\na course at the same distance from the said road to where it crosses\r\nClinch River; thence resuming the remaining boundary as described in\r\nthe first proposition.\r\n\r\n4. A line (being a double blue line on the map) beginning at a point\r\none mile south of the junction of the Clinch and Tennessee Rivers;\r\nthence westerly along the course of the road 1-1/2 miles south thereof\r\nuntil it entered into Cumberland Mountains; thence a northeasterly\r\ncourse along the ridges of said mountains on the west of Powell's\r\nValley and River to the source of the river next above Clear Fork, and\r\nthence down the middle of the same to the northeast divisional line;\r\nthe Tennessee River and the further line thence, as described in the\r\nfirst proposition, to be the remaining boundary.\r\n\r\nIn case the Indians should accept the first proposition and cede the\r\ntract therein described, or a greater quantity, the commissioners were\r\nto solemnly guarantee the Cherokees the remainder of their country and\r\nagree to their payment by the United States of either an annuity of\r\n$4,000, or to deliver them, on the signing of the treaty, goods to the\r\namount of $5,000 and the further sum of $20,000 in four equal annual\r\ninstallments.\r\n\r\nRefusing the first and accepting the second proposition, they were to\r\nreceive the same guarantee, and an annuity of $3,000, or $5,000 at once\r\nin goods and $15,000 in three equal annual installments.\r\n\r\nRefusing the first and second and accepting the third proposition, the\r\nsame guarantee was offered and an annuity of $2,000, or $5,000 in goods\r\non signing the treaty and $10,000 in two equal annual installments.\r\n\r\nAccepting the fourth proposition, to the exclusion of the other three,\r\nthe same guarantee was to be given, together with an annuity of $1,000,\r\nor $5,000 in goods on signing the treaty and the same amount during the\r\nyear 1799.\r\n\r\nIt was also represented by the Secretary of War that the arts and\r\npractices used to obtain Indian land in defiance of treaties and the\r\nlaws, at the risk of involving the whole country in war, had become\r\nso daring, and received such countenance from persons of prominent\r\ninfluence, as to render it necessary that the means to countervail\r\nthem should be augmented. To this end, as well as to more effectually\r\nsecure to the United States the advantages of the land which should be\r\nobtained by the treaty, the commissioners were instructed to secure the\r\ninsertion into the treaty of provisions of the following import:\r\n\r\n1. That the new line should be run and marked by two commissioners, one\r\nof whom should be appointed by the treaty commissioners and the other\r\nby the Indians. They should proceed immediately upon the signing of\r\nthe treaty to the execution of that duty, upon the completion of which\r\nthree maps thereof should be prepared, one for the use of the Secretary\r\nof War, one for the executive of the State of Tennessee, and one for\r\nthe Cherokees.\r\n\r\n2. That the Cherokees should at all times permit the President of the\r\nUnited States to employ military force within their boundaries for\r\nthe arrest and removal of all persons seeking to make unauthorized\r\nnegotiations with or to incite their hostility toward the United States\r\nor any of its citizens, or toward any foreign nation or Indian nation\r\nor tribe within the limits and under the protection of the United\r\nStates; also, of all persons who should settle on or who should attempt\r\nto reside in the Indian country without the written permission of the\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\n3. That the treaty should not be construed either to affect the right\r\nor title of any ejected settler upon the Indian lands to the tract\r\ntheretofore occupied by him or in any manner to enlarge his right or\r\nclaim thereto; and that all Indian land purchased by the contemplated\r\ntreaty, which had not been actually occupied as aforesaid, should\r\nremain subject to the operation of all the provisions of the proposed\r\nas well as any former treaty and of the laws of the United States\r\nrelative to Indian country, until such time as said lands should be\r\nsold by and under the authority of the United States. This provision\r\nwas intended to prevent any further intrusion on any part of the land\r\nceded by the State of North Carolina to the United States; as also\r\nupon the land set apart to the Cherokee Indians by the State of North\r\nCarolina, by act of her legislature, passed May 17, 1783, described as\r\nfollows, viz: \"Beginning on the Tennessee, where the southern boundary\r\nof this State intersects the same, nearest to the Chicamauga towns;\r\nthence up the middle of the Tennessee and Holston to the middle of\r\nFrench Broad; thence up the middle of French Broad River (which lines\r\nare not to include any island or islands in the said river) to the\r\nmouth of Big Pigeon River; thence up the same to the head thereof;\r\nthence along the dividing ridge, between the waters of Pigeon River and\r\nTuckasege River, to the southern boundary of this State.\"\r\n\r\n4. The United States should have the right to establish such military\r\nposts and garrisons within the Indian limits for their protection as\r\nshould be deemed proper. In case it should be found impracticable to\r\nobtain Duck River or a line that should include within it the road\r\nleading from Southwest Point to Cumberland River for a boundary, the\r\ncommissioners were to stipulate for certain parcels of land lying on\r\nsuch road at convenient distances from each other for the establishment\r\nof houses of entertainment for travelers. Also in case the cession\r\nobtained should not include both sides of the ferry on Clinch River, to\r\nsecure a limitation upon the rates of toll that should be charged by\r\nthe occupant.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners repaired to Knoxville, where they ascertained it to\r\nbe the desire of the Indians that the treaty negotiations should be\r\nheld at Oostenaula, the Cherokee capital.\r\n\r\nTo this the commissioners objected, but agreed to meet the Indians\r\nat Chota, which they concluded to change to Tuckasege, and, finally,\r\nbefore the date fixed for the meeting, June 25, again changed it to\r\nTellico, where the conference was held.[112]\r\n\r\n_Tennessee commissioners attend the council._--In the mean time[113]\r\nGovernor Sevier of Tennessee designated General Robertson, James\r\nStuart, and Lachlan McIntosh as agents to represent the interests of\r\nthat State at the treaty, and gave them minute instructions covering\r\nthe following points,[114] viz:\r\n\r\n1. To obtain as wide an extinguishment of the Cherokee claim north of\r\nthe Tennessee River as possible.\r\n\r\n2. An unimpeded communication of Holston and Clinch Rivers with the\r\nTennessee and the surrender of the west bank of the Clinch opposite\r\nSouth-West Point.\r\n\r\n3. To secure from future molestation the settlements as far as they had\r\nprogressed on the northern and western borders of the State and the\r\nconnection of Hamilton and Mero districts, then separated by a space of\r\nunextinguished hunting ground 80 miles wide.\r\n\r\n4. To examine into the nature and validity of the claim recently set\r\nup by the Cherokees to lands north of the Tennessee River; whether it\r\nrested upon original right or was derived from treaties; or was founded\r\nonly upon temporary use or occupancy.\r\n\r\nThe council opened early in July. The \"Bloody Fellow,\" a Cherokee\r\nchief, at the outset delivered a paper which he stated to contain their\r\nfinal resolutions, and which covered a peremptory refusal to sell\r\nany land or to permit the ejected settlers to return to their homes.\r\nAfter seeking in vain to shake this determination of the Cherokees,\r\nfurther negotiations were postponed until the ensuing fall, and the\r\ncommissioners departed.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of August, the Secretary of War addressed some additional\r\ninstructions upon the subject to George Walton and Lieut. Col. Thomas\r\nButler as commissioners (John Steele having resigned and Alfred Moore\r\nhaving returned to his home in North Carolina), authorizing them to\r\nrenew the negotiations. The original instructions were to form the\r\nbasis of these negotiations, but if it should be found impracticable to\r\ninduce the Indians to accede to either of the first three propositions,\r\nan abandonment of them was to take place, and resort was to be had to\r\nthe fourth proposition, which might be altered in any manner as to\r\nboundaries calculated to secure the most advantageous results to the\r\nUnited States.[115] The council was resumed at Tellico on the 20th of\r\nSeptember, but it was found, during the progress thereof, that there\r\nwas no possibility of effecting the primary objects of the State agents\r\nof Tennessee. General Robertson failed to attend. General White (who\r\nhad been appointed in the place of Stuart) was there, but Mr. McIntosh\r\nresigned and Governor Sevier himself attended in person.\r\n\r\nThe treaty was finally concluded on the 2d of October, by which a\r\ncession was secured covering most of the territory contemplated by the\r\nfourth proposition, with something additional. It included most if not\r\nall the lands from which settlers had been ejected by the United States\r\ntroops, and they were permitted to return to their homes.\r\n\r\nThe road privilege sought to be obtained between East and Middle\r\nTennessee was also realized, except as to the establishment of houses\r\nof entertainment for travelers.[116]\r\n\r\nPresident Adams transmitted the treaty to the Senate,[117] and that\r\nbody advised and consented to its ratification.\r\n\r\n_Boundary lines surveyed._--In fulfillment of the provisions of the\r\nfifth article of the treaty concerning the survey of boundary lines,\r\nthe President appointed Captain Butler as a commissioner to run that\r\nportion of the line described as extending from Great Iron Mountain in\r\na southeasterly direction to the point where the most southerly branch\r\nof Little River crossed the divisional line to Tugaloo River, which\r\ntrust he executed in the summer of 1799.[118] Owing to the unfortunate\r\ndestruction of official records by fire, in the year 1800, it is\r\nimpossible to ascertain all the details concerning this survey, but it\r\nwas executed on the theory that the \"Little River\" named in the treaty\r\nwas one of the northernmost branches of Keowee River.\r\n\r\nThis survey seems not to have been accepted by the War Department, for\r\non the 3d of June, 1802, instructions were issued by the Secretary of\r\nWar to Return J. Meigs, as a commissioner, to superintend the execution\r\nof the survey of this same portion of the boundary. Mr. Thomas Freeman\r\nwas appointed surveyor.[119]\r\n\r\nFrom the letter of Commissioner Meigs, transmitting the plat and field\r\nnotes of survey,[120] it appears that much difference of opinion had\r\nexisted as to what stream was meant by the \"Little River\" named in the\r\ntreaty, there being three streams of that name in that vicinity. Two of\r\nthese were branches of the French Broad and the other of Keowee River.\r\nIf the line should be run to the lower one of these two branches of the\r\nFrench Broad, it would leave more than one hundred families of white\r\nsettlers within the Indian territory. If it were run to the branch of\r\nKeowee River, it would leave ten or twelve Indian villages within the\r\nState of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nIt was therefore determined by Commissioner Meigs to accept the upper\r\nbranch of French Broad as the true intent and meaning of the treaty,\r\nand the line was run accordingly, whereby not a single white settlement\r\nwas cut off or intersected, and but five Indian families were left on\r\nthe Carolina side of the line.[121]\r\n\r\n_Status of certain territory._--In this connection it is pertinent\r\nto remark that the State of North Carolina claimed for her southern\r\nboundary the thirty-fifth degree of north latitude.\r\n\r\nThe line of this parallel was, however, at that time supposed to run\r\nabout 12 miles to the north of what was subsequently ascertained to be\r\nits true location.\r\n\r\nBetween this supposed line of 35° north latitude and the northernmost\r\nboundary of Georgia, as settled upon by a convention between that State\r\nand South Carolina in 1787, there intervened a tract of country of\r\nabout 12 miles in width, from north to south, and extending from east\r\nto west, from the top of the main ridge of mountains which divides\r\nthe eastern from the western waters to the Mississippi River. This\r\ntract remained, as was supposed, within the chartered limits of South\r\nCarolina, and in the year 1787 was ceded by that State to the United\r\nStates, subject to the Indian right of occupancy. When the Indian title\r\nto the country therein described was ceded to the United States by the\r\ntreaty of 1798 with the Cherokees, the eastern portion of this 12-mile\r\ntract fell within the limits of such cession.\r\n\r\nOn its eastern extremity near the head-waters of the French Broad\r\nRiver, immediately at the foot of the main Blue Ridge Mountains, had\r\nbeen located, for a number of years prior to the treaty, a settlement\r\nof about fifty families of whites, who by its ratification became\r\noccupants of the public domain of the United States, but who were\r\noutside the territorial jurisdiction of any State. These settlers\r\npetitioned Congress to retrocede the tract of country upon which\r\nthey resided to South Carolina, in order that they might be brought\r\nwithin the protection of the laws of that State.[122] A resolution\r\nwas reported in the House of Representatives, from the committee to\r\nwhom the subject had been referred, favoring such a course,[123] but\r\nCongress took no effective action on the subject, and when the State\r\nboundaries came to be finally adjusted in that region the tract in\r\nquestion was found to be within the limits of North Carolina.\r\n\r\n_Yellow Creek settlement._--After that portion of the boundary of the\r\ncountry ceded by the treaty of 1798 which extended along the foot of\r\nCumberland Mountain until it intersected \"Campbell's Line\" had been\r\nsurveyed, complaint was made by certain settlers on Yellow Creek that\r\nby the action of the surveyors in not prolonging the line to its true\r\npoint of termination, their homes had been left within the Indian\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThereupon the Secretary of War instructed Agent Meigs[124] to go in\r\nperson and examine the line as surveyed with a view to ascertaining the\r\ntruth concerning the complaints.\r\n\r\nIt was ascertained that the \"point\" of Campbell's Line was not on\r\nCumberland Mountain proper, but on the ridge immediately east thereof,\r\nknown as Poor Valley Ridge. This ridge is nearly as lofty as the\r\nmain range, and Colonel Campbell, in approaching it from the east,\r\nhad mistaken it for that range and established his terminal point\r\naccordingly. The surveyors under the treaty of 1798, assuming the\r\ncorrectness of Colonel Campbell's survey, had made the line of their\r\nsurvey close thereon. By such action the Indian boundary in that\r\nlocality was extended 332 poles further to the east than would have\r\nbeen the case had the true reading of the treaty been followed.\r\n\r\nA number of families of settlers on Yellow Creek, together with a tract\r\nof about 2,500 acres of land, were thus unfortunately left within the\r\nIndian country. All efforts of Agent Meigs to secure a relinquishment\r\nof this strip of territory from the Indians were, however,\r\nineffectual.[125]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. I, p. 496.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 62.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: This address and remonstrance will be found in full in\r\nAmerican State Papers, Indian Affairs, Vol. I, page 625.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: December 20, 1797.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: American State Papers, Indian Affairs, Vol. I, p. 629.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: American State Papers, Indian Affairs, Vol. I, p. 631.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: These instructions were dated March 2, 1798.

The funds for this purpose were to be raised\r\nby a lottery managed by Cols. James White, James Winchester, Stockley\r\nDonelson, David Campbell, William Cocke, and Robert Hayes. The Indians\r\nnot having granted the necessary right of way, its construction was\r\nnecessarily postponed, but subsequently, by act of the legislature\r\nof Tennessee passed November 14, 1801, the Cumberland Road Company\r\nwas incorporated and required to cut and clear a road from the Indian\r\nboundary on the east side of Cumberland Mountain to the fork of the\r\nroads leading to Fort Blount and Walton's Ferry.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: January 15, 1799.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: See letter of General Pickens to Representative Nott, of\r\nSouth Carolina, January 1, 1800.

There is much difficulty in\r\nascertaining the exact point of departure of \"Meigs Line\" from Great\r\nIron Mountains. In the report of the Tennessee and North Carolina\r\nboundary commissioners in 1821 it is stated to be 31-1/2 miles by the\r\ncourse of the mountain ridge in a general southwesterly course from\r\nthe crossing of Cataluche Turnpike; 9-1/2 miles in a similar direction\r\nfrom Porter's Gap; 21-1/2 miles in a northeasterly direction from the\r\ncrossing of Equovetley Path, and 33-1/2 miles in a like course from the\r\ncrossing of Tennessee River. All of these courses and distances follow\r\nthe crest of the Great Iron Mountains. It is stated to the author, by\r\nGeneral R. N.

Temple, in\r\n1876, shows a portion of the continuation of \"Meigs Line\" as passing\r\nabout 1-1/2 miles east of Quallatown. Surveyor Temple mentions it as\r\nrunning \"S. 50° E.

Meigs, commissioners on the part of the United\r\n    States, and the principal chiefs representing the Cherokee Nation._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nIt is agreed and stipulated that--\r\n\r\n1. The Cherokee Nation relinquish and cede to the United States a\r\ntract of land bounding southerly on the boundary line between the\r\nState of Georgia and the Cherokee Nation, beginning at a point on the\r\nsaid boundary line northeasterly of the most northeast plantation in\r\nthe settlement known by the name of Wafford's Settlement, and running\r\nat right angles with the said boundary line 4 miles into the Cherokee\r\nland, thence at right angles southwesterly and parallel to the first\r\nmentioned boundary line so far as that a line to be run at right angles\r\nsoutherly to the said first mentioned boundary line shall include in\r\nthis cession all the plantations in Wafford's Settlement, so called, as\r\naforesaid.\r\n\r\n2. In consideration of this cession the United States agree to pay the\r\nCherokees $5,000, in goods or cash, upon the signing of the treaty, and\r\nan annuity of $1,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW TREATY AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nCongress, under date of February 19, 1799,[127] appropriated $25,000\r\nto defray the expense of negotiating a treaty or treaties with the\r\nIndians, and again, on the 13th of May, 1800,[128] appropriated $15,000\r\nto defray the expense of holding a treaty or treaties with the Indian\r\ntribes southwest of the Ohio River, with the proviso that nothing in\r\nthe act should be construed to admit an obligation on the part of the\r\nUnited States to extinguish for the benefit of any State or individual\r\nthe Indian claim to any lands lying within the limits of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the authority conferred by these enactments, President\r\nJefferson appointed[129] General James Wilkinson, Wm. R. Davie, and\r\nBenj. Hawkins as commissioners, and they were instructed by the\r\nSecretary of War to proceed to negotiate treaties with the Cherokees,\r\nCreeks, Choctaws, and Chickasaws.\r\n\r\n_Objects of the treaty._--The objects sought to be attained with the\r\nCherokees were to secure their consent, 1st. To cede to the United\r\nStates all that portion of their territory lying to the northward of a\r\ndirect line to be run from a point mentioned in treaty of October 2,\r\n1798, on Tennessee River, 1 mile above its junction with the Clinch,\r\nto the point at or near the head of the West Fork of Stone's River, on\r\nthe ridge dividing the waters of the Cumberland and Duck Rivers which\r\nis struck by a southwest line from the point where the Kentucky road\r\ncrosses Cumberland River, as described in the treaty of Holston.\r\n\r\n2. That the Tennessee River should be the boundary from its mouth to\r\nthe mouth of Duck River; that Duck River should be the boundary thence\r\nto the mouth of Rock Creek; and that a direct line should be run for a\r\ncontinuation of the boundary from the mouth of Rock Creek to the point\r\non the ridge that divides the waters of Cumberland from Duck River.\r\n\r\n3. That a road should be opened from the boundary line to a circular\r\ntract on Tennessee River at the mouth of Bear River, reserved to the\r\nUnited States by treaty of 1786 with the Chickasaws. From this point\r\nthe road should continue until it reached the Choctaw territory, where\r\nit was to connect with a road through the country of the latter to\r\nNatchez. The entire line of this road must be open to the free use of\r\ncitizens of the United States.\r\n\r\n4. In case the Indians should refuse to cede any of the lands\r\ndesignated, the commissioners were instructed to obtain, if possible,\r\na cession of all the land lying northward of the road leading from\r\nKnoxville to the Nashville settlements, run conformably to the treaty\r\nof 1791. If they should be unwilling to grant this, then to ask for a\r\nstrip of land from 1 to 5 miles in width, to include the said road in\r\nits whole extent across their lands. Whether success or failure should\r\nattend the first or second objects of their mission, the commissioners\r\nwere to seek the consummation of the third proposition for a road to\r\nthe Bear Creek reservation, which would otherwise be of no practical\r\nvalue to the United States.\r\n\r\nIf consent was obtained to the first three proposals or to the\r\nalternative marked 4th, an annuity of $1,000 was authorized and an\r\nimmediate sum not exceeding $5,000 in cash or goods. If, as had been\r\nrepresented to the War Department, the Cherokees and Chickasaws both\r\nclaimed the land on either side of Tennessee River for a considerable\r\ndistance, the commissioners were instructed that they must obtain the\r\nassent of both tribes to the opening of the road.\r\n\r\nSix days after the issuance of these instructions, a delegation of\r\nCherokees, headed by Chief \"Glass,\" arrived in Washington, and obtained\r\nan interview with the Secretary of War.[130] They represented that the\r\npromise had been made them, at the treaty of 1798, that they would\r\nnever be asked to cede any more land. Now they learned that the United\r\nStates was about to hold another treaty with them to secure further\r\ncessions. They also desired to know whether the United States or the\r\nsettlers got the land theretofore ceded, and why they had not been\r\nfurnished with the map showing the boundary lines by the treaty of\r\n1798, as had been promised them. In his reply,[131] after seeing the\r\nPresident, the Secretary of War informed them that no desire existed to\r\npurchase any more land from them unless they were anxious to sell; that\r\nthe map should be at once furnished them; that the States of Kentucky\r\nand Tennessee had been formed out of the lands already purchased from\r\nthem, and the main object of the proposed treaty with their nation was\r\nto secure the right of way for roads through their country in order to\r\nmaintain communication between detached white settlements.\r\n\r\nThe delegation strenuously objected to the proposed \"Georgia\" road and\r\nwere informed that the matter would not be pressed, but that the road\r\nto Bear River and Natchez was a necessity.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the visit of this delegation, the instructions to\r\nMessrs. Wilkinson, Davie, and Hawkins were modified,[131] it being\r\nstated by the Secretary of War that he had been mistaken as to\r\npart of the line between the United States and the Cherokees. He\r\ntherefore directed that the second object of their instructions should\r\nbe suspended as regarded both the Cherokees and the Chickasaws.\r\nCommissioner Davie having declined his appointment, General Andrew\r\nPickens was substituted in his stead.[132]\r\n\r\n_Failure of negotiations._--It is only necessary to observe that the\r\ncommissioners failed in the accomplishment of any of their designs with\r\nthe Cherokees.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAFFORD'S SETTLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPrior to the survey and marking of the boundary line near Currahee\r\nMountain in Georgia, provided for by the Cherokee treaty of 1785 and\r\nthe Creek treaty of 1790, which survey did not occur until 1798, one\r\nColonel Wafford, in company with sundry other persons, had formed a\r\nsettlement in that vicinity, which proved to be within the limits of\r\nthe Indian country.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as it was supposed these parties had ignorantly placed\r\nthemselves within the Indian line and had made considerable and\r\nvaluable improvements, the Government was indisposed to use harsh or\r\nforcible means for their ejection, but rather approved of the urgent\r\nappeals from Colonel Wafford and his neighbors to make an effort to\r\nsecure the relinquishment from the Indians of a tract sufficient to\r\nembrace their settlement.\r\n\r\nThe Government had been laboring under the impression that these lands\r\nbelonged to the Creeks, but the delegation of the Cherokees, headed\r\nby \"The Glass,\" who visited Washington in the summer of 1801, claimed\r\nthem as Cherokee territory, and asked for the removal of the settlers.\r\nCommissioners Wilkinson, Hawkins, and Pickens had been instructed[133]\r\nto negotiate with the Creeks for the purchase of this tract, but they\r\nhaving reported, upon examination, that the title was undoubtedly in\r\nthe Cherokees, were directed[134] to report upon the expediency of\r\napplying to the Cherokees for a cession of the same.\r\n\r\nSuch an application having at this time been unfavorably received\r\nby the Cherokees, nothing further was done in the matter until the\r\nwinter of 1803,[135] when the Secretary of War directed a conference\r\nto be held with them for the double purpose of securing a cession or\r\na lease for seven years of the \"Wafford Settlement\" tract and the\r\nIndian consent to a right of way for a road through their country\r\nfrom Southwest Point or Tellico Factory to Athens, Ga., with the\r\nestablishment of the necessary houses of entertainment for travelers\r\nalong such route. For this latter concession he was authorized to\r\noffer them the sum of $500. The Cherokees having refused both these\r\npropositions, Agent Meigs was directed[136] to secure the granting\r\nof the road privilege, if possible, by offering Vann[137] and other\r\nmen of influence among them a proper inducement to enlist their\r\nactive co-operation in the matter. This latter method seems to have\r\nbeen effective, for later in the season[138] the Secretary of War\r\ntransmitted to the governors of Georgia and Tennessee an extract from\r\nan agreement entered into with the Cherokees providing for an opening\r\nof the desired road, stating that, as the United States had no funds\r\napplicable to the laying out and construction of such a road, it would\r\nbe proper for the legislatures of those States to make the necessary\r\nprovision therefor.\r\n\r\nThe clamor for more land by the constant tide of immigration that was\r\nflowing into Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia from the North and East\r\nbecame more and more importunate. The desire to settle on Indian land\r\nwas as potent and insatiable with the average border settler then as it\r\nis now.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER NEGOTIATIONS AUTHORIZED.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the recent and oft-repeated refusals of the Cherokees\r\nto part with more land, a new commission, consisting of Return J. Meigs\r\nand Daniel Smith, was appointed and instructed[139] by the Secretary\r\nof War to negotiate a treaty for the cession of lands in Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, or Georgia, and particularly of the tract near the Currahee\r\nMountain, including the Wafford settlement.\r\n\r\nThey were authorized to pay for the first cession a sum not exceeding\r\n$14,000, coupled with an annuity of $3,000, and for the \"Wafford tract\"\r\nnot exceeding $5,000, together with an annuity of $1,000, and were\r\ndirected to give \"Vann,\" a Cherokee chief, $200 or $300 to secure his\r\ninfluence in favor of the proposed purchase.\r\n\r\n_Purchase of Wafford settlement tract._--In pursuance of these\r\ninstructions a conference was held with the Cherokees at Tellico,\r\nTenn.,[140] at which they concluded the arrangements for the cession of\r\nthe Wafford tract, but failed in their further objects. The treaty was\r\nsigned on the 24th of October, and transmitted to the Secretary of War\r\na week later,[141] two persons having been appointed to designate and\r\nrun the lines of the ceded tract, which was found to be 23 miles and\r\n64 chains in length and 4 miles in width.[142]\r\n\r\n_Singular disappearance of treaty._--No action having been taken\r\nlooking toward the ratification of this treaty for several years\r\nensuing, Return J. Meigs, in the winter of 1811,[143] addressed a\r\nletter to the Secretary of War calling attention to it, setting forth\r\nthe fact that its consideration had theretofore been postponed on\r\naccount of a misunderstanding in relation to the limits of the ceded\r\ntract, but that the Cherokees had now of their own motion, and at their\r\nown expense, had a survey made of 10 miles and 12 chains in length in\r\naddition to the original survey, which would make the tract ceded 33\r\nmiles and 76 chains in length, and which would include the plantation\r\nof every settler who could make the shadow of a claim to settlement\r\nprior to the survey of the general boundary line run in 1797[144] by\r\nColonel Hawkins. He therefore concluded that there could be no reason\r\nfor further postponing the ratification of the treaty, and urged that\r\nit be done without delay.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this letter of Agent Meigs no further notice seems to\r\nhave been taken of the treaty, and it had been entirely lost sight\r\nof until attention was again called to it by a Cherokee delegation\r\nvisiting Washington early in 1824, nearly twenty years after its\r\nconclusion.[145]\r\n\r\nAfter diligent search among the records of the War Department,\r\nSecretary Calhoun reported[146] that no such treaty could be found and\r\nno evidence that any such treaty had ever been concluded. Whereupon\r\nthe Cherokee delegation produced their duplicate copy of the treaty\r\ntogether with other papers relating to it. The Secretary of War,\r\nafter receiving a reply[147] to a letter addressed by him to Colonel\r\nMcKee, of the House of Representatives (who was one of the subscribing\r\nwitnesses to the treaty), became satisfied of its authenticity, and\r\nthe President thereupon[148] transmitted the Cherokee duplicate to the\r\nSenate, which body advised and consented to its ratification. It was\r\nduly proclaimed by the President on the 17th of May, 1824.[149]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Commissioner Smith in his letter of October 31, 1804, to\r\nthe Secretary of War, states that two persons on the part of the United\r\nStates, to be accompanied by two Cherokee chiefs, had been designated\r\nto run the boundaries of this cession. The propriety was then urged on\r\nthe Cherokees by the commissioners of making a cession of the lands\r\nlying between East and West Tennessee. Several days were consumed in\r\nurging this proposal, and a majority of the chiefs were probably in\r\nfavor of it, but Commissioner Smith remarks that a majority, unless it\r\namounts almost to unanimity, is not considered with them sufficient to\r\ndetermine in matters of great interest, particularly in making cessions\r\nof lands.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 228.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. I, p. 618.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. II, p. 82.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: The President's appointment of these commissioners bore\r\ndate of June 18, 1801.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: This interview occurred, as shown by the Indian Office\r\nrecords, on the 30th of June, 1801, and was adjourned to meet again on\r\nthe 3d of July.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: July 3, 1801.

All former treaties providing for peace and prevention of crimes are\r\ncontinued in force.\r\n\r\n2. The Cherokees cede to the United States all the land which they have\r\nheretofore claimed lying to the north of the following boundary line:\r\nBeginning at the mouth of Duck River; thence up the main stream of the\r\nsame to the junction of the fork at the head of which Fort Nash stood,\r\nwith the main south fork; thence a direct course to a point on the\r\nTennessee River bank opposite the mouth of Hiwassa River. If the line\r\nfrom Hiwassa should leave out Field's settlement, it is to be marked\r\naround his improvement and then continued the straight course; thence\r\nup the middle of the Tennessee River (but leaving all the islands to\r\nthe Cherokees) to the mouth of Clinch River; thence up the Clinch\r\nRiver to the former boundary line agreed upon with the said Cherokees,\r\nreserving at the same time to the use of the Cherokees a small tract\r\nlying at and below the mouth of Clinch River; from the mouth extending\r\nthence down the Tennessee River from the mouth of Clinch to a notable\r\nrock on the north bank of the Tennessee in view from Southwest Point;\r\nthence a course at right angles with the river to the Cumberland road;\r\nthence eastwardly along the same to the bank of Clinch River, so as to\r\nsecure the ferry landing to the Cherokees up to the first hill and down\r\nthe same to the mouth thereof, together with two other sections of one\r\nsquare mile each, one of which is at the foot of Cumberland Mountain,\r\nat and near the place where the turnpike gate now stands, the other on\r\nthe north bank of the Tennessee River where the Cherokee Talootiske now\r\nlives. And whereas from the present cession made by the Cherokees, and\r\nother circumstances, the sites of the garrisons at Southwest Point and\r\nTellico are become not the most convenient and suitable places for the\r\naccommodation of the said Indians, it may become expedient to remove\r\nthe said garrisons and factory to some more suitable place; three other\r\nsquare miles are reserved for the particular disposal of the United\r\nStates on the north bank of the Tennessee opposite to and below the\r\nmouth of Hiwassa.\r\n\r\n3. In consideration of the foregoing cession the United States agree to\r\npay $3,000 at once in merchandise, $11,000 in 90 days, and an annuity\r\nof $3,000.\r\n\r\n4. The United States to have the use of two roads through the Cherokee\r\ncountry, one from the head of Stone's River to Georgia road, and\r\nthe other from Franklin to the Tombigbee settlements, crossing the\r\nTennessee River at Muscle Shoals.\r\n\r\n5. Treaty to take effect upon ratification by the President by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 150: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 93.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY CONCLUDED OCTOBER 27, 1805; PROCLAIMED JUNE 10, 1806.[151]\r\n\r\n    _Held at Tellico, Tenn., between Return J. Meigs and Daniel\r\n    Smith, commissioners on behalf of the United States, and certain\r\n    chiefs and headmen of the Cherokees, representing that nation._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\n1. The Cherokees cede the section of land at Southwest Point, extending\r\nto Kingston, reserving the ferries and the first island in Tennessee\r\nRiver above the mouth of Clinch River.\r\n\r\n2. The Cherokees consent to the free and unmolested use by the United\r\nStates of the mail road from Tellico to Tombigbee so far as it passes\r\nthrough their country.\r\n\r\n3. In consideration of the foregoing the United States agree to pay the\r\nCherokees $1,600 within 90 days.\r\n\r\n4. Treaty to be obligatory on ratification by the President by and with\r\nthe advice and consent of the Senate.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA RESPECTING BOTH TREATIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUED NEGOTIATIONS AUTHORIZED.\r\n\r\nThe commissioners (Return J. Meigs and Daniel Smith) who were appointed\r\nand instructed under date of April 4,1804, and who negotiated the\r\ntreaty of October 24, 1804, with the Cherokees, it will be remembered,\r\nfailed in the object of their instructions, except as to the single\r\nmatter of securing the cession of a tract covering the settlement of\r\nColonel Wafford and others near Currahee Mountain. They were, however,\r\ndirected to continue their negotiations from time to time until the\r\nfull measure of their original instructions should be secured.\r\n\r\n_Treaties of October 25 and 27, 1805, considered together._--This\r\ncourse was pursued, and after several fruitless conferences the\r\ncommissioners succeeded in concluding the treaties of October 25, 1805,\r\nand October 27, 1805. Inasmuch as these two treaties were negotiated by\r\nthe same commissioners, acting under the same instructions and at the\r\nsame conference, they will be considered together. The treaties were\r\nupon their conclusion transmitted to the Secretary of War,[152] and,\r\nupon submission to the Senate, that body duly advised and consented to\r\ntheir ratification. They were ratified and proclaimed by the President\r\non the 24th of April and 10th of June, 1806, respectively.[153]\r\n\r\n_Secret agreement with Doublehead._--Following the transmission of\r\nthe treaties to the Secretary of War by the commissioners, the latter\r\naddressed[154] an explanatory communication to him, in which they set\r\nforth that by the terms of the treaty of October 25, 1805, there were\r\nreserved three square miles of land, \"for the particular disposal of\r\nthe United States, on the north bank of the Tennessee, opposite and\r\nbelow the mouth of Hiwassa.\" This reservation, they affirmed, was\r\npredicated ostensibly on the supposition that the garrison at Southwest\r\nPoint and the United States factory at Tellico would be placed thereon\r\nduring the pleasure of the United States, but that they had stipulated\r\nwith \"Doublehead,\" a Cherokee chief, that whenever the United States\r\nshould find this land unnecessary for the purposes mentioned it was to\r\nrevert to him (Doublehead), provided that he should retain one of the\r\nsquare miles to his own use, but should relinquish his right and claim\r\nto the other two sections in favor of John D. Chisholm and John Riley\r\nin equal shares.\r\n\r\n_Purchase of site for State capital._--The cession by the treaty of\r\nOctober 27, 1805, of the section of land at Southwest Point was secured\r\nupon the theory that the State of Tennessee would find Kingston a\r\nconvenient and desirable place for the establishment of the State\r\ncapital. A subsequent change of circumstances and public sentiment,\r\nhowever, caused it to be located seven years later at Nashville.\r\n\r\n_Boundaries surveyed._--On the 11th of July, 1806, the Secretary of\r\nWar notified Return J. Meigs of his appointment as commissioner to\r\nsuperintend the running and marking of the line \"from the junction of\r\nthe fork at the head of which Fort Nash stood with the main south fork\r\nof Duck River to a point on the Tennessee River bank opposite the mouth\r\nof Hiwassee River.\" He was also to superintend the survey of the lines\r\nof the reserved tracts agreeably to the treaty of October 25, 1805.\r\n\r\nHe was directed to appoint a surveyor, but before running the line from\r\nDuck to Tennessee Rivers above described, to have him survey and mark\r\nthe lines of the 3-mile tract reserved opposite to and below the mouth\r\nof Hiwassee, and also, when completed, to designate the most suitable\r\nsite for the military post, factory, and agency, each site to be 300\r\nfeet square and 40 rods distant from the others.\r\n\r\nCommissioner Meigs followed the letter of his instructions and caused\r\nthe lines to be surveyed in accordance therewith. The line from Duck\r\nRiver to the mouth of Hiwassee was begun on the 9th and finished on the\r\n26th of October, 1806. The point of departure at the west end of the\r\nboundary line was a red elm tree, trimmed and topped, standing on the\r\nextreme point of land formed by the confluence of that branch of Duck\r\nRiver at the head of which Fort Nash stood, with the main south fork of\r\nthe river. The eastern terminus of the line was a mulberry tree on the\r\nnorth bank of Tennessee River opposite the mouth of Hiwassee River, 73\r\nmiles and 166 poles from the beginning.[155]\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTROVERSY CONCERNING \"DOUBLEHEAD\" TRACT.\r\n\r\nColonel Martin, who was employed by Commissioner Meigs, also surveyed\r\nunder the latter's direction during the same month the four small\r\nreserved tracts described in the treaty of October 25, 1805.[155] One\r\nof these afterwards produced much controversy. The language of the\r\ntreaty called for three square miles on the north bank of Tennessee\r\nRiver, _opposite to and below_ the mouth of Hiwassee River. Colonel\r\nMeigs, who was one of the commissioners who negotiated the treaty and\r\nwas therefore entirely familiar with its intent, caused this tract to\r\nbe surveyed adjoining the main line of cession, extending from Duck\r\nRiver to the mouth of Hiwassee and north of that line, which placed\r\nthe tract opposite to and _above_ the mouth of Hiwassee, instead of\r\n\"opposite to and below\" the mouth of that river.[156]\r\n\r\nAs above stated, while this reserve was ostensibly for the location of\r\na military post and factory or trading establishment, it was really\r\nintended for the Cherokee chief Doublehead and other influential\r\npersons, as the price of their influence in securing from the Cherokees\r\nthe extensive cession of land granted by the treaty.\r\n\r\nThis was sought to be secured by means of a secret article attached\r\nto the treaty. This article was reported to the War Department by the\r\ntreaty commissioners[157] and made a matter of record, but it was\r\nnever sent to the State Department nor to the Senate for the advice\r\nand consent of that body. After Agent Meigs had erected the Hiwassee\r\ngarrison buildings on the tract, suit was brought in 1809 by Colonel\r\nMcLung against the agent for the recovery of the land and mesne\r\nprofits, basing his claim to title upon a grant from the State of\r\nNorth Carolina, of date long prior to the treaty of 1805. The suit was\r\ndecided in the plaintiff's favor by the Tennessee courts. Subsequently,\r\nin 1838, John Riley made application to the Government for compensation\r\nfor the loss of his one-third interest in this tract. The question\r\nwas submitted to the Attorney-General of the United States for his\r\nopinion. He decided that the secret article, not having been submitted\r\nto the Senate for approval, was not to be considered as any part of the\r\ntreaty; but that, if the commissioners had any authority for making\r\nsuch an agreement, the defective execution of their powers ought not to\r\nprejudice parties acting in good faith and relying on their authority;\r\nnevertheless, no relief could be had except through the action of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThis secret article was also applicable to the small tract at and\r\nbelow the mouth of Clinch River, to the 1 mile square at the foot of\r\nCumberland Mountain, and to the 1 mile square on the north bank of the\r\nTennessee River, where Cherokee Talootiske lived. The first mentioned\r\ntract was also intended for the benefit of Doublehead, who leased\r\nit February 19, 1806, to Thomas H. Clark for twenty years. Before\r\nthe expiration of the lease Doublehead was killed by some of his own\r\npeople. December 10, 1820, the State of Tennessee assumed to grant the\r\ntract to Clark.[158]\r\n\r\nThe other two tracts alluded to of one square mile each were intended\r\nfor Cherokee Talootiske. May 31, 1808, Talootiske perpetually leased\r\nhis interest in the Cumberland Mountain tract to Thomas H. Clark.\r\nSeptember 17, 1816, Clark purchased the interest of Robert Bell in the\r\nsame tract, the latter deriving his alleged title under a grant from\r\nNorth Carolina to A. McCoy in July, 1793. This tract was also included\r\nin a grant from North Carolina to J. W. Lackey and Starkey Donaldson,\r\ndated January 4, 1795. The tract on Tennessee River, Talootiske sold to\r\nRobert King, whose assigns also claimed the title under the aforesaid\r\ngrant from North Carolina to Lackey and Donaldson.[158]\r\n\r\nFrom the phraseology of the treaty in making these several\r\nreservations, it was concluded advisable in subsequent negotiations to\r\nsecure a relinquishment of the tribal title thereto, which was done by\r\nthe treaty of July 18, 1817.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 151: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 95.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 152: November 2, 1805.

C., between Henry Dearborn,\r\n    Secretary of War, specially authorized thereto by the President of\r\n    the United States, and certain chiefs and headmen of the Cherokee\r\n    Nation, duly authorized and empowered by said nation._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\n1. The Cherokees relinquish to the United States all claim to \"all that\r\ntract of country which lies to the northward of the river Tennessee\r\nand westward of a line to be run from the upper part of Chickasaw\r\nOld Fields, at the upper point of an island called Chickasaw Island\r\non said river, to the most easterly head-waters of that branch of\r\nsaid Tennessee River called Duck River, excepting the two following\r\ndescribed tracts, viz: one tract bounded southerly on the said\r\nTennessee River, at a place called the Muscle Shoals; westerly, by a\r\ncreek called Te Kee, ta, no-eh, or Cyprus Creek, and easterly, by Chu,\r\nwa, lee, or Elk River or Creek, and northerly by a line to be drawn\r\nfrom a point on said Elk River, ten miles on a direct line from its\r\nmouth * * * to a point on the said Cyprus Creek, ten miles on a direct\r\nline from its junction with the Tennessee River. The other tract is\r\nto be two miles in width on the north side of Tennessee River, and to\r\nextend northerly from that river three miles, and bounded as follows,\r\nviz: Beginning at the mouth of Spring Creek and running up said creek\r\nthree miles on a straight line; thence westerly two miles at right\r\nangles with the general course of said creek; thence southerly on a\r\nline parallel with the general course of said creek to the Tennessee\r\nRiver; thence up said river by its waters to the beginning, which first\r\nreserved tract is to be considered the common property of the Cherokees\r\nwho now live on the same, including John D. Chesholm, Au, tow, we, and\r\nCheh Chuh, and the other reserved tract, on which Moses Melton now\r\nlives, is to be considered the property of said Melton and of Charles\r\nHicks, in equal shares. * * * Also relinquish * * * all right or claim\r\n* * * to the Long Island in Holston River.\"\r\n\r\n2. The United States agree to pay, in consideration of the foregoing\r\ncession, $2,000 in money upon the ratification of the treaty; $8,000 in\r\nfour equal annual installments; to erect a grist-mill within one year\r\nin the Cherokee country; to furnish a machine for cleaning cotton; and\r\nto pay the Cherokee chief, Black Fox, $100 annually during his life.\r\n\r\n3. The United States agree to urge upon the Chickasaws to consent to\r\nthe following boundary between that nation and the Cherokees south of\r\nTennessee River, viz: Beginning at the mouth of Caney Creek near the\r\nlower part of Muscle Shoals, and run up said creek to its head, and in\r\na direct line from thence to the Flat Stone, or Rock, the old corner\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\n4. The United States agree that the claims of the Chickasaws to the\r\ntwo tracts reserved by article 1 of this treaty, on north side of the\r\nTennessee River, shall be settled by the United States in such manner\r\nas will secure the title to the Cherokees.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: See report of Commissioner Indian Affairs to Secretary\r\nof War, December 9, 1834.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 101.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY CONCLUDED SEPTEMBER 11, 1807; PROCLAIMED APRIL 22, 1808.[160]\r\n\r\n    _Held at upper end of Chickasaw Island, in Tennessee River,\r\n    between James Robertson and Return J. Meigs, acting under authority\r\n    of the Executive of the United States, and a delegation of Cherokee\r\n    chiefs representing said nation._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nThis treaty is simply an elucidation of the first article of the\r\ntreaty of January 7, 1806, and declares that the eastern limits of the\r\ntract ceded by the latter treaty \"shall be bounded by a line so to be\r\nrun from the upper end of the Chickasaw Old Fields, a little above\r\nthe upper point of an island, called Chickasaw Island, as will most\r\ndirectly intersect the first waters of Elk River; thence carried to\r\nthe great Cumberland Mountain, in which the waters of Elk River have\r\ntheir source; then along the margin of said mountain, until it shall\r\nintersect the lands heretofore ceded to the United States at the said\r\nTennessee ridge.\"\r\n\r\nIn consideration of this concession, the United States agree to pay to\r\nthe Cherokees $2,000 and to permit the latter to hunt upon the tract\r\nceded until the increase of settlements renders it improper.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTROVERSY CONCERNING BOUNDARIES.\r\n\r\nShortly after the conclusion of the treaties of October 25 and 27,\r\n1805, a delegation of Cherokee chiefs and headmen visited Washington.\r\nMessrs. Return J. Meigs and Daniel Smith, the commissioners who had\r\nnegotiated those treaties, accompanied them.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War, Hon. Henry Dearborn, was specially deputized by\r\nthe President to conduct negotiations with them for the purchase of\r\nsuch portions of their country as they might feel willing to sell, but\r\nmore especially to extinguish their claim to the region of territory\r\nlying to the north and east of Tennessee River and west of the head\r\nwaters of Duck River.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were concluded and the treaty was signed on the 7th\r\nof January, 1806,[161] and the President transmitted the same to the\r\nSenate on the 24th of the same month; but that body did not consent to\r\nits ratification for more than a year afterwards.[162]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the conclusion of this treaty, it was supposed by all\r\nthe parties thereto that the eastern limit of the cession therein\r\ndefined would include all of the waters of Elk River, the impression\r\nbeing that the headwaters of Duck River had their source farther to the\r\neast than those of the Elk.[163]\r\n\r\nThe region of country in question had for many years been claimed by\r\nboth the Cherokees and the Chickasaws, and the Government of the United\r\nStates, not desiring to incur the animosity of either of these Indian\r\nnations, had preferred rather to extinguish by purchase the claim of\r\neach. With this end in view, a treaty had already been concluded with\r\nthe Chickasaws, under date of July 23, 1805,[164] resulting in their\r\nrelinquishment of all claim to the land north of Duck River lying\r\neast of the Tennessee and to a tract lying between Duck and Tennessee\r\nRivers, on the north and south, and east of the Columbian Highway, so\r\nas to include all the waters of Elk River. It had been the intention\r\nthat the eastern boundary of the cession made by both these nations\r\nshould be coincident from the head of Chickasaw Island northward,\r\nbut when the country came to be examined with a view to running the\r\nline, it was found that a strict adherence to the test of the Cherokee\r\ncession would leave about two hundred families of settlers on the\r\nheadwaters of Elk River still within the Indian country.[165] In the\r\nmean time the Chickasaws, having learned that the United States had\r\npurchased of the Cherokees their supposed claim to the territory as\r\nfar west as the Tennessee River, including a large region of country\r\nto the westward of the limits of the cession of 1805 by the former,\r\nconstrued that fact as a recognition of the sole and absolute title of\r\nthe Cherokees thereto, and became in consequence very much excited and\r\nangered. They were only pacified by an official letter of assurance\r\nfrom the Secretary of War, addressed to Maj. George Colbert, their\r\nprincipal chief,[166] wherein he stated that in purchasing the Cherokee\r\nright to the tract in question the United States did not intend to\r\ndestroy or impair the right of the Chickasaw Nation to the same; but\r\nthat, being persuaded no actual boundary had ever been agreed on\r\nbetween the Chickasaws and Cherokees and that the Cherokees had some\r\nclaim to a portion of the lands, it was thought advisable to purchase\r\nthat claim, so that whenever the Chickasaws should be disposed to\r\nconvey their title there should be no dispute with the Cherokees about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees by this treaty also relinquished all claim they might\r\nhave to the Long Island or Great Island, as it was sometimes called,\r\nof Holston River. This island was in reality outside the limits of the\r\ncountry assigned the Cherokees by the first treaty between them and\r\nthe United States, at Hopewell, in 1785, but they had always since\r\nmaintained that no cession had ever been made of it by them, and\r\nit was deemed wise to insert a specific clause in the treaty under\r\nconsideration to that effect.[167]\r\n\r\n_Boundaries to be surveyed._--Early in 1807[168] the Secretary of War\r\nnotified Agent Meigs that Mr. Thomas Freeman had been appointed to\r\nsurvey and mark the boundary line conformably to both the treaty of\r\n1805 with the Chickasaws and of 1806 with the Cherokees, as well as\r\nto survey the land ceded between the south line of Tennessee and the\r\nTennessee River, lying west of the line from about the Chickasaw Old\r\nFields to the most eastern source of Duck River. He was also advised\r\nthat General Robertson and himself had been designated to attend and\r\nsuperintend the running of such boundary lines. Furthermore, that it\r\nwas desirable that the eastern line of both cessions should be one\r\nand the same, for although by the Chickasaw treaty the whole waters\r\nof Elk River were included, it was evident their claim to any lands\r\neast of the line agreed upon by the Cherokees was more than doubtful;\r\nthat, therefore, the United States ought not to insist on such a\r\nline as would go to the eastward of the one defined in the Cherokee\r\ntreaty, unless the latter could be prevailed upon to extend the same,\r\nin which event they were authorized to offer the Cherokees a moderate\r\ncompensation therefor.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATORY TREATY NEGOTIATED.\r\n\r\nThis led, upon the assembly of the commissioners and surveyor at\r\nChickasaw Old Fields, in the fall of 1807 (for the purpose of surveying\r\nand marking the boundary lines in question), to the negotiation of an\r\nexplanatory treaty with certain of the Cherokee chiefs, on the 11th of\r\nSeptember, 1807,[169] whereby it was agreed that the Cherokee cession\r\nline should be extended so far to the eastward as to include all the\r\nwaters of Elk River and thereby be made coincident and uniform with the\r\nChickasaw line.\r\n\r\n_Secret article._--The ostensible consideration paid for this\r\nconcession, as shown by the treaty, was $2,000; but it was secretly\r\nagreed that $1,000 and two rifles should be given to the chiefs with\r\nwhom the treaty was negotiated.[170]\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson transmitted this latter treaty to the Senate on\r\nthe 29th of March, 1808, and having received the consent of that body\r\nto its ratification, it was proclaimed by the President on the 22d of\r\nApril following.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 103.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 101.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: May, 1807.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: Message of President Jefferson to U.

The north boundary of the lands ceded by the Creek treaty of 1814,\r\nas between such cession and the Cherokees, is declared to extend from\r\na point on the west bank of Coosa River opposite the lower end of the\r\nTen Islands and above Fort Strother, in a direct line, to the Flat Rock\r\nor Stone on Bear Creek, a branch of the Tennessee, which line shall\r\nconstitute the south boundary of the Cherokee country lying west of\r\nCoosa River and south of Tennessee River.\r\n\r\n2. The Cherokees concede to the United States the right to lay off,\r\nopen, and have the free use of all roads through their country north\r\nof said line necessary to convenient intercourse between the States of\r\nTennessee, Georgia, and Mississippi Territory; also the free navigation\r\nof all rivers within the Cherokee territory. The Cherokees agree to\r\nestablish and maintain on the aforementioned roads the necessary\r\nferries and public houses.\r\n\r\n3. In order to prevent future disputes concerning the boundary above\r\nrecited, the Cherokees agree to appoint two commissioners to accompany\r\nthe United States commissioners appointed to run said line.\r\n\r\n4. When the United States appoint a commissioner to lay off a road as\r\nprovided for above, the Cherokees shall also appoint one to accompany\r\nhim, who will be paid by the United States.\r\n\r\n5. The United States agree to reimburse individual Cherokees for losses\r\nsustained by them in consequence of the marching of militia and United\r\nStates troops through their territory, amounting to $25,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the ratification of the treaty of September 11, 1807,\r\nwith the Cherokees, no other treaty receiving the final sanction of\r\nthe Senate and President was concluded with them until March 22,\r\n1816;[174] but in the interval sundry negotiations and matters of\r\nofficial importance were conducted with them, which it will be proper\r\nto summarize.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLONEL EARLE'S NEGOTIATIONS FOR THE PURCHASE OF IRON-ORE TRACT.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the year 1807, Col. Elias Earle, of South\r\nCarolina, proposed to the Secretary of War the establishment of iron\r\nworks, with suitable shops, in the Cherokee Nation, on substantially\r\nthe following conditions, viz: That a suitable place should be looked\r\nout and selected where sufficient quantities of good iron ore could\r\nbe found, in the vicinity of proper water privileges, for such an\r\nestablishment; that the Indians should be induced to make a cession of\r\na tract of land, not less than 6 miles square, which should embrace the\r\nore bed and water privilege; that so much of the land so ceded as the\r\nPresident of the United States should deem proper should be conveyed to\r\nhim (Earle), including the ore and water facilities, whereon he should\r\nbe authorized to erect iron works, smith shops, and so forth. Earle,\r\non his part, engaged to erect such iron works and shops as to enable\r\nhim to furnish such quantities of iron and implements of husbandry\r\nas should be sufficient for the use of the various Indian tribes in\r\nthat part of the country, including those on the west side of the Ohio\r\nand Mississippi Rivers; also to deliver annually to the order of the\r\nGovernment of the United States such quantities of iron and implements\r\nas should be needed for the Indian service, and on such reasonable\r\nterms as should be mutually agreed upon.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War referred the propositions of Colonel Earle to\r\nthe President of the United States, who gave them his sanction, and\r\naccordingly Agent Meigs, of the Cherokees, was instructed[175] to\r\nendeavor to procure from the Cherokees such a cession as was proposed,\r\nso soon as Colonel Earle should have explored the country and selected\r\na suitable place for the proposed establishment. Colonel Earle made the\r\nnecessary explorations, and found a place at the mouth of Chickamauga\r\nCreek which seemed to meet the requirements of the case.\r\n\r\nThereupon Agent Meigs convened the Indians in council at Highwassee,\r\nTennessee, at which Colonel Earle was present, and concluded a\r\ntreaty[176] with them. By its terms, in consideration of the sum of\r\n$5,000 and 1,000 bushels of corn, the Cherokees ceded a tract of\r\ncountry 6 miles square at the mouth of Chickamauga Creek, on the\r\nsouth side of Tennessee River, to be laid off in square form so as to\r\ninclude the creek to the best advantage for such site. The treaty also\r\ncontained a proviso that in case the ore supply should fail at this\r\npoint, the United States should have full liberty to procure it within\r\nthe Cherokee territory at the most suitable and convenient place.\r\nTwenty-five hundred dollars of the consideration was at once paid in\r\ncash to the Indians and 1,000 bushels of corn agreed to be delivered\r\nto them the following spring. Colonel Earle carried the treaty to\r\nWashington at the next session of Congress for ratification.[177]\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson transmitted it to the Senate with a favorable\r\nmessage,[178] but before any action was taken by that body it was\r\nascertained that the tract selected and ceded was within the limits of\r\nthe State of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe matter of ratification was therefore postponed, with the hope\r\nthat the State of Tennessee would consent to relinquish her claim to\r\nthe land. In this the President was disappointed. No further action\r\nwas taken for several years, until, it having become evident that no\r\nconcession would be made in the matter by the legislature of Tennessee,\r\nthe United States Senate[179] unanimously rejected the treaty. In\r\nconsequence of this action, Colonel Earle made claim[180] against the\r\nGovernment either for the value of his time and expenses incurred in\r\nexploring the Cherokee country, selecting the site, and procuring the\r\nconclusion of the treaty, or, as an alternative, that the consent of\r\nthe Cherokees should be secured to the cession of another tract of\r\nsimilar area and character.\r\n\r\nThe latter proposition was accepted, and Agent Meigs was advised[181]\r\nthat Mr. Earle had been granted permission to select some other site\r\nsuitable for his iron works, and instructed that in case he did so,\r\nnegotiations should again be opened with the Cherokees for an exchange\r\nof the tract covered by the cession of 1807 for the one newly selected.\r\n\r\nSuccess, however, does not seem to have attended this second attempt,\r\nand Agent Meigs was advised[182] by the Secretary of War that $985 had\r\nbeen paid Colonel Earle for damages sustained by him in the Cherokee\r\ncountry while detained there by the Indians, which amount must be\r\ndeducted from the Cherokee annuity.\r\n\r\nA third attempt of a similar character was made in 1815, when[183]\r\nColonel Earle was appointed to negotiate, in conjunction with the\r\nIndian agent, a treaty with the Cherokees or Chickasaws for the\r\npurchase of a 6-mile square tract for the erection of his proposed\r\niron works. Like the previous efforts, it was without results.[184]\r\n\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE FAILS TO CONCLUDE A TREATY WITH THE CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nCongress on the 18th of April, 1806,[185] had passed an act entitled\r\n\"An act to authorize the State of Tennessee to issue grants and perfect\r\ntitles to certain lands therein described, and to settle claims to the\r\nvacant and unappropriated lands within the same.\"\r\n\r\nThis act, for the purpose of defining the limits of the vacant and\r\nunappropriated lands in the State of Tennessee, thereafter to be\r\nsubject to the sole control and disposition of the United States,\r\nestablished the following described line, viz: Beginning at the place\r\nwhere the eastern or main branch of Elk River intersects the southern\r\nboundary of Tennessee; running thence due north until such line shall\r\nintersect the northern or main branch of Duck River; thence down the\r\nwaters of Duck River to the military boundary line established by North\r\nCarolina in 1783; thence with the military line west to the place where\r\nit intersects Tennessee River; thence down the waters of Tennessee\r\nRiver to where it intersects the northern line of Tennessee. The act\r\nfurther provided that upon the execution by the State of Tennessee\r\n(through her Senators and Representatives in Congress, duly authorized\r\nthereto) of a deed of relinquishment to the United States of all the\r\nclaim of that State to lands lying south and west of the described\r\nline, the United States should thereupon cede and convey to the State\r\nof Tennessee all claim to the land north and east of the line, with\r\ncertain conditions and limitations therein prescribed, and with the\r\nproviso that nothing contained in the act should be construed to affect\r\nthe Indian title.\r\n\r\nPredicated upon this act of Congress, the legislature of Tennessee\r\npassed an act, on the 3d of December, 1807,[186] appropriating $20,000\r\nfor the purpose of holding a treaty or treaties with the Cherokees\r\n(when authorized so to do by the Federal Government) for the purpose of\r\nextinguishing their claim to all or any part of the lands within the\r\nterritorial limits of Tennessee lying to the north and east of the line\r\ndescribed in the act of Congress just mentioned.\r\n\r\nCongress having assented to the request of Tennessee, the Secretary\r\nof War appointed[187] Return J. Meigs a commissioner to superintend\r\nthe negotiations with the Cherokees about to be held with them by the\r\ntwo commissioners appointed on the part of that State. Mr. Meigs was\r\nadvised that all the expenses incident to the holding of the treaty,\r\nas well as any consideration that should be agreed upon in case of a\r\ncession by the Indians, should be borne by the State of Tennessee, and\r\nthat the only lands the commission were authorized to treat for was\r\nthat portion of the territory described in the act of April 18, 1806,\r\nas being ceded to Tennessee which should be found to lie east of the\r\nline established by Robertson and Meigs, running from the upper part of\r\nChickasaw Old Fields northwardly so as to include all the waters of Elk\r\nRiver. The jealousy with which the Cherokees regarded a proposition for\r\nthe sale of more land, and their especial aversion toward the people\r\nand government of Tennessee, prevented success from attending these\r\nnegotiations in any degree.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF CHEROKEES TO THE WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI PROPOSED.\r\n\r\nIt had been the policy of the Federal Government, from the beginning of\r\nits official relations with the Indian tribes, to encourage and assist\r\nthe individuals of those tribes in grasping and accepting the pursuits\r\nand habits of civilized life, with a view to their preparation for the\r\ncondition in which the rapidly encroaching white settlements would in a\r\nfew years inevitably place them.\r\n\r\nWith the disappearance of game the hunter must become a tiller of\r\nthe soil or a herdsman, with the alternative of starvation. This\r\nhumane policy, begun systematically in the first administration of\r\nWashington,[188] took the form of a considerable annual expenditure\r\nin the purchase for the Indians of hoes, plows, rakes, and other\r\nagricultural implements, as well as looms, cards, and spinning wheels.\r\nAmong the northwestern tribes these efforts at industrial civilization\r\nwere productive of trifling results. The southern tribes, however, and\r\nmore especially the Creeks and Cherokees, had, in considerable numbers,\r\nmanifested a partial though gradually increasing tendency toward\r\nself-support. Many of them, in addition to raising the necessaries of\r\nlife, were producers in a limited degree of cotton, from which their\r\nwomen had learned to make a coarse article of cloth; others owned\r\nconsiderable herds of cattle and hogs, and altogether these tribes had\r\nmade a degree of progress which was alike commendable to themselves and\r\nencouraging to the Government.\r\n\r\nHowever, the persistent and unremitting demands of the border settlers\r\nfor more land, backed by the thorough sympathy and influence of the\r\nState governments of Tennessee, North Carolina, and Georgia, as well as\r\nby their Senators and Representatives in Congress, acted as a powerful\r\nlever for moving the Congress and Executive of the United States to\r\nseek the complete possession of the Creek, Cherokee, Choctaw, and\r\nChickasaw lands.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1803[189] President Jefferson had suggested the\r\ndesirability of the removal of these tribes beyond the Mississippi\r\nRiver, although the first official action taken in this direction was\r\ncontained in the fifth section of an act of Congress approved March 26,\r\n1804, erecting Louisiana into two Territories. This act appropriated\r\n$15,000 to enable the President to effect the desired object. This was\r\nsupplemented in 1808,[190] when the Secretary of War, in a letter to\r\nAgent Meigs giving permission for a delegation of Cherokees to visit\r\nWashington, instructed him to improve every opportunity of securing the\r\nconsent of the Cherokees to an exchange of their lands for a tract west\r\nof the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe delegation here spoken of (composed of what were known as Upper\r\nCherokees) visited Washington about the 1st of May, 1808, and, in the\r\ncourse of a discussion of the subject with the Secretary of War, took\r\noccasion to complain of an unequal distribution of annuities between\r\nthe Upper and Lower Cherokees, and advanced a proposition that a\r\ndividing line be run between the territory of these two branches of\r\nthe tribe, inasmuch as the former were cultivators of the soil, and\r\ndesired to divide their lands in severalty and become citizens of the\r\nUnited States, while the latter were addicted to the hunter life and\r\nwere indisposed to adopt civilized habits.[191] This proposition met\r\nwith the personal approval of the Secretary of War. He instructed\r\nthe agent[192] to ascertain the sentiments of the nation upon such\r\na proposition, to the end that, if possible, those who adhered to\r\naboriginal habits could be induced to accept a country in the newly\r\nacquired Territory of Louisiana, in lieu of their proportionate share\r\nof the country then occupied by the Cherokee Nation. In pursuance\r\nof this plan, the agent lost no opportunity of impressing upon the\r\nCherokees the importance of the approaching crisis in their tribal\r\naffairs, and the necessity that some practical method should be adopted\r\nto solve the problem of subsistence involved in the rapid diminution of\r\ngame. Many of the Lower or \"hunter\" Cherokees became persuaded of the\r\nnecessity of looking out a new home, and early in January, 1809,[193]\r\nPresident Jefferson addressed a \"talk\" to them, approving their project\r\nand promising facilities for the transportation of a delegation to\r\nvisit the Arkansas and White River countries, where, in case they found\r\na suitable location, the United States would assign them a sufficient\r\narea of territory for their occupation in exchange for their share of\r\nthe Cherokee domain east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nBased upon this proposition, a pioneer delegation of the Indians\r\nvisited that country in the year 1809, and upon their report large\r\nnumbers (about 2,000, as reported by Agent Meigs) of the nation\r\nsignified their intention of removal as early as the autumn of that\r\nyear. The United States authorities were not as yet prepared to defray\r\nthe pecuniary expense of so large a migration. The agent was therefore\r\ndirected to discourage for the present anything except the removal of\r\nindividual families.[194] The situation remained unchanged until the\r\nspring of 1811,[195] when the Secretary of War informed Agent Meigs\r\nthat time and circumstances had rendered it expedient to revive the\r\nsubject of a general removal and exchange of lands. The latter was\r\nadvised that it was very desirable to secure a cession of the Cherokee\r\nlands lying within the States of Tennessee and South Carolina, and that\r\nin case the whole nation could be brought to agree to the proposition\r\nof ceding these tracts, as the proportionate share of the \"emigrant\r\nparty,\" in exchange for lands to be assigned such party on White and\r\nArkansas Rivers, he would be authorized and directed to negotiate a\r\ntreaty with the Cherokee Nation for that purpose. From this time the\r\nsubject remained _in statu quo_ for several years, except that small\r\nparties of Cherokees, consisting of a few individuals or families,\r\ncontinued to emigrate to the \"promised land.\" It is perhaps interesting\r\nto state, in connection with this emigration movement of the Cherokees,\r\nthat it was primarily inaugurated shortly after the treaty of 1785,\r\nat Hopewell, when a few of those dissatisfied with the terms of that\r\ninstrument embarked in pirogues, and, descending the Tennessee, Ohio,\r\nand Mississippi Rivers, reached and ascended the Saint Francis, then\r\nin the Spanish province of Louisiana, where they formed a settlement,\r\nfrom whence in a few years they removed to a more satisfactory location\r\non White River. Here they were joined from time to time by their\r\ndissatisfied eastern brethren, in families and small parties, until\r\nthey numbered, prior to the treaty of 1817, between two and three\r\nthousand souls.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFORTS OF SOUTH CAROLINA TO EXTINGUISH CHEROKEE TITLE.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of December, 1810, the governor of South Carolina\r\ntransmitted to the President a resolution of the legislature of that\r\nState urging an extinguishment of the Cherokee Indian title to lands\r\nwithin her State limits.[196] The Secretary of War, in his letter of\r\nacknowledgment,[197] assured the governor that measures would soon\r\nbe taken to bring about the desired cession if possible. Nothing of\r\nimportance seems, however, to have been done until the winter of 1814,\r\nwhen Agent Meigs was appointed[198] a commissioner for the purpose of\r\nnegotiating a treaty with this end in view. He was instructed that\r\nthe State of South Carolina would have an agent present, authorized\r\nto defray the expenses of the treaty and to adjust the compensation\r\nthat should be agreed upon in consideration of the proposed cession,\r\nagreeably to the provisions of the twelfth section of an act of\r\nCongress approved March 30, 1802, for regulating trade and intercourse\r\nwith the Indian tribes.\r\n\r\nThese negotiations not having proved successful, the Secretary of War\r\nauthorized Agent Meigs[199] to bring a delegation of the Cherokees to\r\nWashington for this and other purposes of negotiation.\r\n\r\nThis delegation arrived early in the spring of 1816, and the Hon.\r\nGeorge Graham, being specially authorized by the President, concluded a\r\ntreaty on the 22d of March of that year.[200] Therein, in consideration\r\nof the sum of $5,000, to be paid by the State of South Carolina within\r\nninety days from the date of its ratification by the President and\r\nSenate, subject also to ratification by the Cherokee national council\r\nand by the governor of South Carolina, the Cherokees ceded to that\r\nState all claim to territory within her boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was transmitted[201] to the Senate by President Madison,\r\nand ratified and proclaimed, as set forth in the abstract of its\r\nprovisions hereinbefore given, on the 8th of April, 1816.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNDARY BETWEEN CHEROKEES, CREEKS, CHOCTAWS, AND CHICKASAWS.\r\n\r\nThe lines of demarkation between the respective possessions of the\r\nCherokee, Creek, Choctaw, and Chickasaw Nations had long been a subject\r\nof dispute between them. People living in a state of barbarism and\r\nprincipally dependent upon the chase for a livelihood, necessarily roam\r\nover a vast amount of territory within which no permanent habitations\r\nhave been established by themselves. An accurate definition of the\r\nboundaries between them and their nearest neighbors pursuing a\r\nsimilar mode of life is unnecessary so long as no disturbing factor\r\nis brought into the case. But contact with an ever-encroaching tide\r\nof civilization renders essential an accurate definition of limits.\r\nThe United States, in several of its numerous treaties for the\r\nacquisition of territory from these four tribes, had been met with\r\nconflicting claims as to its ownership. In order that future disputes\r\nand embarrassments of this character should be avoided, the authorities\r\nof the United States entertained the idea of causing a boundary line\r\nto be run and marked between the adjoining territory of these tribes.\r\nThe Indian agents were advised by the Secretary of War[202] that\r\nthe subject was under consideration, the plan being to constitute a\r\ncommission, consisting of two representatives selected by each tribe\r\nand of the United States agents for those tribes, who should, after\r\nfull examination of the country and the subject, agree upon and fix\r\ntheir respective boundaries. Owing, however, to the complicated state\r\nof our foreign relations and the feverish condition of mind manifested\r\nby the border tribes, soon followed by war with England and with the\r\nCreek Indians, it became necessary to drop further negotiations on the\r\nsubject, and the matter was not again revived in this form.\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty of 1814 with the Creeks, however, whereby General\r\nJackson exacted from them, as indemnity for the expenses of the war,\r\nthe cession of an immense tract of country in Alabama and Georgia,[203]\r\nthe question of the proper limits of this cession on the north and\r\nwest became a subject of controversy between the United States and the\r\nCherokees, Choctaws, and Chickasaws.\r\n\r\nThe United States authorities at Washington were anxious that nothing\r\nshould occur in the adjustment of these boundaries which should cause\r\na feeling of irritation among those tribes. Commissioners had been\r\nappointed in the summer of 1815 to survey and mark the boundaries of\r\nthis Creek cession, and in August of that year we find the Secretary\r\nof War giving instructions to Agent Meigs, of the Cherokees, to meet\r\nthe boundary commissioners, with a few of the principal Cherokee\r\nchiefs, at the point on Coosa River where the south boundary of the\r\nCherokee Nation crossed the same, in order that the Cherokees should\r\nbe satisfied that the commissioners began at the proper point. Several\r\nadditional reminders were given the agent, during the progress of\r\nthe survey, that the matter of boundary was a question of fact to be\r\nascertained and determined from the best attainable evidence, and that\r\ncare must be taken that no injustice should be done the Cherokees.[204]\r\nIn the following spring[205] a delegation of Cherokees was brought\r\nto Washington, by direction of the War Department, and, pending the\r\ncompletion of treaty negotiations with them, the boundary commissioners\r\nwere instructed not to mark the line between the Cherokees and the\r\nCreek cession until further orders.\r\n\r\nThese negotiations resulted in a second treaty of March 22, 1816[206]\r\n(the one for the cession of the tract in South Carolina bears the same\r\ndate), wherein it was declared that the northern boundary line of the\r\nCreek cession of 1814 should be established by the running of a line\r\nfrom a point on the west bank of Coosa River opposite to the lower end\r\nof the Ten Islands, above Fort Strother, directly to the Flat Rock or\r\nStone on Bear Creek, said Flat Rock being the southwest corner of the\r\nCherokee possessions, as defined by the treaty with them concluded\r\nJanuary 7, 1806.\r\n\r\nThis boundary brought forth a vigorous though unavailing protest from\r\nGeneral Jackson, who argued that the Cherokees never had any right to\r\nterritory south of the Tennessee and west of Coosa River, but that it\r\nbelonged to the Creeks and was properly within the limits of their\r\ncession of 1814.[207]\r\n\r\nAll efforts were fruitless in securing any further cession of lands,\r\neither north or south of the Tennessee.[208]\r\n\r\nPrevious to the visit of the Cherokee delegation to Washington and\r\nto the instructions given, as referred to above, to the boundary\r\ncommissioners to suspend the running of the boundary line between the\r\nCreek cession and the Cherokees pending negotiations with the latter,\r\nGeneral Coffee had been engaged in surveying the line from Coosa\r\nRiver to the Tennessee River.[209] As a result of the negotiations\r\nwith the Cherokees, additional instructions were given the boundary\r\ncommissioners[210] (accompanying which was a copy of the Cherokee\r\ntreaty concluded on the 22d of March preceding) to run and mark the\r\nboundary line therein agreed upon from the lower end of the Ten\r\nIslands, on Coosa River, to the Flat Rock, on Bear Creek. They were\r\nadvised that the surveys already made by General Coffee might be of\r\nadvantage to them, though from an examination of his report it did\r\nnot appear he had taken any notice of the point at which this line\r\nwas to terminate, notwithstanding he seemed to have had in view the\r\ntreaty made with the Cherokees in the year 1806, which proposed Caney\r\nCreek and a line from its source to the Flat Rock as the boundary\r\nbetween the Cherokees and Chickasaws. Coffee's line had already\r\nexcited the jealousy and opposition of the Chickasaws, and on the\r\nsame day final instructions were given the commissioners to run the\r\nline from Coosa River to Flat Rock, Major Cocke, the Chickasaw agent,\r\nwas directed to advise the Chickasaws that in agreeing upon this line\r\nwith the Cherokees the United States had in no degree interfered\r\nwith the conflicting claims of the Chickasaws south of that line\r\nand east of Coffee's line; that from an examination of the treaties\r\nwith the Chickasaws and Cherokees, and especially that of 1786 with\r\nthe former tribe, it appeared that a point called the Flat Rock was\r\nconsidered a corner of the lands belonging to them, and had since\r\nbeen considered as the corner to the Cherokee, Creek, and Chickasaw\r\nhunting grounds. It is proper to state in this connection that for many\r\nyears an uncertainty had existed in the minds of both the Indians and\r\nthe United States authorities as to the exact location of this Flat\r\nRock,[211] and whether it was on Bear Creek or on the headwaters of\r\nthe Long Leaf Pine, a branch of the Black Warrior River. The line as\r\nfinally run by the commissioners from Flat Rock, on Bear Creek, to Ten\r\nIslands, pursued a course bearing S. 67° 56' 27\" E. 118 miles and 40\r\nperches.[212] It may be interesting also to quote from a letter[213]\r\nfrom William Barnett, one of the United States boundary commissioners,\r\nto his co-commissioner, General Coffee, in which, he states that he has\r\njust returned from the council at Turkeytown, at which the Cherokees,\r\nChoctaws, Chickasaws, and Creeks were represented, and that the\r\nprincipal purpose of the council was to agree upon and adjust their\r\nseveral boundaries. He notes the fact that the Creeks and Cherokees had\r\nagreed to make a joint stock of their lands, with a privilege to each\r\nnation to settle where they pleased. The Creeks and Choctaws had fixed\r\non the ridge dividing the waters of the Black Warrior and the Cahawba\r\nas their former boundary. The Chickasaws and Cherokees could come to\r\nno understanding as to their divisional line, the former alleging that\r\nthey had no knowledge of any lands held by the latter on the south side\r\nof the Tennessee River adjoining them; that they always considered the\r\nlands so claimed by the Cherokees as belonging to the Creeks, and in\r\nsupport of this they had exhibited to him a number of affidavits in\r\nproof that their line ran from the mouth of a small creek emptying into\r\nthe Tennessee near Ditto's Landing (opposite Chickasaw Island), up the\r\nsame to its source, thence to the head of the Sipsey Fork of the Black\r\nWarrior, and down the same to the Flat Rock, where the Black Warrior is\r\n200 yards wide; that they had no knowledge of any place on Bear Creek\r\nknown as Flat Rock, and that running the line to the last mentioned\r\nplace would be taking from them a considerable tract of country, to\r\nwhich they could by no means consent.[214]\r\n\r\n\r\nROADS THROUGH THE CHEROKEE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nIn order to secure a proper system of communication between the\r\nTennessee and the Lower Alabama and Mississippi settlements, the United\r\nStates had long desired the establishment of sufficient roads through\r\nthe Indian country between those points. The Indians, however, were\r\nshrewd enough to perceive that the granting of such a permission would\r\nbe but an entering wedge for splitting their country in twain, and\r\nafford excuse for the encroachments of white settlers.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of new thoroughfares had therefore been regarded with\r\nextreme jealousy and had never been yielded to by them except after a\r\npersistency of urging that bordered on force.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1811[215] Agent Meigs was advised by the Secretary\r\nof War of the expediency of having a road opened without delay from\r\nthe Tennessee to the Tombigbee, and also one from Tellico. Both these\r\npropositions would require the consent of the Creeks, and for the\r\npurpose of securing the most advantageous routes it was contemplated\r\nthat Captain Gaines should make a journey of exploration and survey\r\nof the country between the Alabama and Coosa Rivers on the south and\r\nTennessee and Hiwassee Rivers on the north. The fruition of these plans\r\nwas also postponed on account of the ensuing war with the Creeks, and\r\nthe subject was not again broached until after their subjugation.\r\nIn the spring of 1814 the legislature of Tennessee transmitted two\r\nmemorials to Congress on the subject, and, by direction of the\r\nSecretary of War, Agent Meigs was again instructed[216] to ascertain\r\nthe bent of the Indian mind in relation thereto. The result was the\r\nconclusion, with the approval of the President, of two agreements\r\nbetween the Cherokees and the agents of certain road companies for\r\nthe opening of two roads through the country of the latter from\r\nTennessee to Georgia. But when the treaty of March 22, 1816, came to\r\nbe negotiated at Washington, the United States authorities, after much\r\npersuasion, procured the insertion therein of an article conceding to\r\nthe United States a practically free and unrestrained permission for\r\nthe construction of any and all roads through the Cherokee country\r\nnecessary to convenient intercourse between the northern and southern\r\nsettlements.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: Two treaties appear of the same date and negotiated by\r\nthe same parties.

The chiefs assert that part of their people formerly\r\nlived at a place called Chickasaw Old Fields, on the Tennessee,\r\nabout 20 miles above the mouth of Elk River; that while living there\r\nthey had a war with the Cherokees, when, finding themselves too much\r\nseparated from their principal settlements, they removed back thereto.\r\nAfterwards, on making peace with the Cherokees, their boundaries were\r\nagreed on as they are defined in the instrument given them by President\r\nWashington in 1794.\r\n\r\nThey further state that they had a war with the Shawnees and drove\r\nthem from all the waters of the Tennessee and Duck Rivers, as well\r\nas conflicts with the Cherokees, Choctaws, and Creeks, in which they\r\ndefeated all attempts of their enemies to dispossess them of their\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAgent Meigs remarks that he is convinced the claim of the Chickasaws\r\nis the best founded; that until recently the Cherokees had always\r\nalluded to the country in controversy as the hunting ground of the four\r\nnations, and that their few settlements within this region were of\r\nrecent date.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY CONCLUDED SEPTEMBER 14, 1816; PROCLAIMED DECEMBER 30, 1816.[217]\r\n\r\n    _Held at Chickasaw Council House, between Maj. Gen. Andrew\r\n    Jackson, General David Merriwether, and Jesse Franklin,\r\n    commissioners plenipotentiary on the part of the United States, and\r\n    the delegates representing the Cherokee Nation._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nTo perpetuate peace and friendship between the United States and the\r\nCherokees and to remove all future dissensions concerning boundaries it\r\nis agreed:\r\n\r\n1. Peace and friendship are established between the United States and\r\nCherokees.\r\n\r\n2. The Cherokee Nation acknowledge the following as their western\r\nboundary: South of the Tennessee River, commencing at Camp Coffee, on\r\nthe south side of the Tennessee River, which is opposite the Chickasaw\r\nIsland; running from thence a due south course to the top of the\r\ndividing ridge between the waters of the Tennessee and Tombigby Rivers;\r\nthence eastwardly along said ridge, leaving the headwaters of the Black\r\nWarrior to the right hand until opposed by the west branch of Wells'\r\nCreek; down the east bank of said creek to the Coosa River, and down\r\nsaid river.\r\n\r\n3. The Cherokees cede all claim to land south and west of the above\r\nline. In consideration for such cession the United States agree to pay\r\nan annuity of $6,000 for ten years and the sum of $5,000 within sixty\r\ndays after ratification of the treaty.\r\n\r\n4. The boundary line above described, after due notice given to the\r\nCherokees, shall be ascertained and marked by commissioners appointed\r\nby the President, accompanied by two representatives of the Cherokee\r\nNation.\r\n\r\n5. The Cherokee Nation agree to meet the United States treaty\r\ncommissioners at Turkeytown, on Coosa River, September 28, 1816, to\r\nconfirm or reject said treaty; a failure to so meet the commissioners\r\nto be equivalent to ratification.\r\n\r\nRatified at Turkeytown by the whole Cherokee Nation, October 4, 1816.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER PURCHASE OF CHEROKEE LANDS.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of May, 1816, the Secretary of War instructed Agent Meigs\r\nto endeavor, at the next session of the national council of the\r\nCherokees, to obtain a cession of the Cherokee claim north of Tennessee\r\nRiver within the State of Tennessee. For this proposed cession he was\r\nauthorized to pay $20,000, in one or more payments, and $5,000 in\r\npresents; also to give Colonel Lowry, an influential chief among them,\r\na sum equal to the value of his improvements.[218]\r\n\r\nHe was further instructed to make an effort to secure the cession of\r\nthe lands which they had declined to sell the previous winter and\r\nwhich lay to the west of a line drawn due south from that point of the\r\nTennessee River intersected by the eastern boundary of Madison County,\r\nAlabama.\r\n\r\nThe necessity for these cessions, and especially that of the former\r\ntract, had been urged upon the Government of the United States by the\r\nlegislature and by the citizens of Tennessee, many of whom had been\r\npurchasers of land within its limits, from the State of North Carolina,\r\na quarter of a century previous, and who had been restrained from\r\npossession and occupancy of the same by the United States authorities\r\nso long as the Indian title remained unextinguished. In the event that\r\nthe national council of the Cherokees should decline to accede to the\r\ndesired cessions, Agent Meigs was to urge that the Cherokee delegation\r\nappointed to meet the boundary commissioners at the Chickasaw Council\r\nHouse on the 1st of September following should be invested with full\r\nauthority for the conclusion of such adjustment of boundaries as might\r\nbe determined on at that place. This authority was conditionally\r\ngranted by the council,[219] and when the delegation came to meet the\r\nUnited States commissioners at the Chickasaw Council House, in the\r\nmonth of September, an agreement was made as to boundaries as set\r\nforth in the second article of the treaty of September 14, 1816. By\r\nthis agreement the Cherokees ceded all claim west of a line from Camp\r\nCoffee to the Coosa River and south of a line from the latter point to\r\nFlat Rock, on Bear Creek.[220] The treaty was ratified by the nation in\r\ngeneral council, at Turkeytown, on the 4th of October following.[221]\r\n\r\n_Alabama alleges error in survey._--When the due-south line from\r\nCamp Coffee provided for in the treaty was surveyed, the surveyor,\r\nthrough an error in running it, deflected somewhat to the west. When\r\nthe adjacent country came to be surveyed and opened up to settlement\r\nmuch complaint was made, and the legislature of Alabama[222] passed a\r\njoint resolution reciting the fact that through this erroneous survey\r\nmuch valuable land had been left within the Cherokee limits which had\r\nproperly been ceded to the United States and instructing Alabama's\r\ndelegation in Congress to take measures for having the line correctly\r\nrun. The matter having been by Congress referred to the Secretary of\r\nWar for investigation and report, the Commissioner of the General Land\r\nOffice, at his request, reported[223] that when the public surveys were\r\nmade in that section it was found that neither the line due south from\r\nCamp Coffee nor from the head of Caney Creek had been surveyed on a\r\ntrue meridian. Inasmuch, however, as they had been run and marked by\r\ncommissioners appointed by the United States, the surveyors necessarily\r\nmade the public surveys in conformity to them. By this deviation from\r\nthe true meridian the United States and the State of Alabama had\r\ngained more land from the manner in which the Caney Creek or Chickasaw\r\nboundary line had been run than had been lost by the deviation in the\r\nCherokee or Camp Coffee line, and the quantity in either case did not\r\nperhaps exceed six or eight thousand acres.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 215: May 25.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: April 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 148.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: See Indian Office records.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 219: Letter of Return J.

Treaty to be binding upon the assent and ratification of the Senate\r\nand President of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLICY OF REMOVING INDIAN TRIBES TO THE WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.\r\n\r\nIn the settlement and colonization by civilized people of a country\r\ntheretofore a wilderness, and inhabited only by savage tribes, many\r\nimportant and controlling reasons exist why the occupation of such a\r\ncountry should be accomplished by regular and gradual advances and\r\nin a more or less connected and compact manner. It was expedient\r\nthat a united front should be presented by the earlier settlers of\r\nthis continent, in order that the hostile raids and demonstrations\r\nof the Indian warriors might be successfully resisted and repulsed.\r\nTherefore, the settlements were, as a rule, extended from the coast\r\nline toward the interior by regular steps, without the intermission of\r\nlong distances of unoccupied territory. This seemed to be the policy\r\nanterior to the Revolution, and was announced in the proclamation of\r\nKing George in 1763 wherein he prohibited settlements being made on\r\nIndian lands or the purchase of the same by unauthorized persons.\r\n\r\nThe first ordinances of Congress under the Articles of Confederation\r\nfor disposing of the public lands were predicated upon the same theory.\r\nBut after the close of the war for independence, circumstances arising\r\nout of the treaty of 1783 with Great Britain and the acquisition of\r\nLouisiana from France imposed the necessity for a departure from\r\nthe old system. Within the limits of the territory thus acquired\r\nsundry settlements had been made by the French people at points\r\nwidely separated from one another and with many hundreds of miles of\r\nwilderness intervening between them and the English settlements on\r\nthe Atlantic slope. The evils and inconveniences resulting from this\r\nirregular form of frontier were manifest.\r\n\r\nSettlements thus widely separated, or projecting in long, narrow\r\ncolumns far into the Indian country, manifestly increased in large\r\nratio the causes of savage jealousy and hostility. At the same time\r\nthe means of defense were rendered less certain and the expense and\r\ndifficulty of adequately protecting such a frontier were largely\r\nenhanced.\r\n\r\nSuch, however, was the condition and shape of our frontier settlements\r\nduring the earlier years of the present century. Settlements on the\r\nTennessee and Cumberland were cut off from communication with those of\r\nGeorgia, Lower Alabama, and Mississippi by long stretches of territory\r\ninhabited or roamed over by the Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws, and\r\nChickasaws.\r\n\r\nThe French communities of Kaskaskia, Vincennes, and Detroit were\r\nsimilarly separated from the people of Virginia, Pennsylvania, and\r\nnewly settled Ohio by the territory of the hostile Shawnees, Miamis,\r\nWyandots, Pottawatomies, Ottawas, Kickapoos, _et al._\r\n\r\nA cure for all this inconvenience and expense had been sought and given\r\nmuch consideration by the Government authorities.\r\n\r\nPresident Jefferson (as has been previously stated) had, as early\r\nas 1803,[225] suggested the propriety of an exchange of lands by\r\nthose tribes east of the Mississippi for an equal or greater area of\r\nterritory within the newly acquired Louisiana purchase, and in 1809 had\r\nauthorized a delegation of Cherokees to proceed to that country with a\r\nview to selecting a suitable tract to which they might remove, and to\r\nwhich many of them did remove in the course of the years immediately\r\nsucceeding.[226]\r\n\r\nThe matter of a general exchange of lands, however, became the\r\nsubject of Congressional consideration, and the Committee on Public\r\nLands of the United States Senate reported[227] a resolution for an\r\nappropriation to enable the President to negotiate treaties with\r\nthe Indian tribes which should have for their object an exchange of\r\nterritory owned by any tribe residing east of the Mississippi for other\r\nland west of that river.\r\n\r\nThe committee expressed the opinion that the proposition contained\r\nin the foregoing resolution would be better calculated to remedy\r\nthe inconvenience and remove the evils arising out of the existing\r\ncondition of the frontier settlements than any other within the power\r\nof the Government. It was admitted, however, that this object could\r\nnot be attained except by the voluntary consent of the several tribes\r\ninterested, made manifest through duly negotiated treaties with them.\r\n\r\nThe Senate was favorable to this proposition, but the House of\r\nRepresentatives interposed a negative upon the action taken by the\r\nformer body.[228]\r\n\r\n_Removal of Cherokees encouraged._--The subject had long been under\r\nconsideration by the Cherokees, and no opportunity had been lost on the\r\npart of the executive authorities of the United States to encourage a\r\nsentiment among them favorable to the removal scheme. Many individuals\r\nof the tribe had already emigrated, and on the 18th of October, 1816,\r\nGeneral Andrew Jackson, in addressing the Secretary of War upon the\r\nsubject of the recent Cherokee and Chickasaw treaties, suggested\r\nhis belief that the Cherokees would shortly make a tender of their\r\nwhole territory to the United States in exchange for lands on the\r\nArkansas River. He further remarked that a council would soon be held\r\nby them at Willstown to select a proper delegation who should visit\r\nthe country west of the Mississippi and examine and report upon its\r\ncharacter and adaptability for their needs. In case this report should\r\nprove favorable, a Cherokee delegation would thereupon wait upon the\r\nPresident, with authority to agree upon satisfactory terms of exchange.\r\nTo this the Secretary of War replied that whenever the Cherokee Nation\r\nshould be disposed to enter into an arrangement for an exchange of the\r\nlands occupied by them for lands on the west side of the Mississippi\r\nRiver and should appoint delegates clothed with full authority to\r\nnegotiate a treaty for such exchange they would be received by the\r\nPresident and treated with on the most liberal terms.\r\n\r\nThis state of feeling among the Cherokees had been considerably\r\nincreased by the fact that those of their people who had already\r\nsettled upon the Arkansas and White Rivers had become involved in\r\nterritorial disputes of a most serious character with the Osages and\r\nQuapaws. The latter tribes claimed ownership of the lands upon which\r\nthe former were settled. Upon the Arkansas Cherokees laying their\r\ncomplaints before the United States authorities, they were informed\r\nthat nothing could be done for their relief until the main body of the\r\nnation should take some definite action, in accordance with previous\r\nunderstanding, toward relinquishing a portion of their territory equal\r\nin area to the tract upon which the emigrant party had located.[229]\r\n\r\n\r\nFURTHER CESSION OF TERRITORY BY THE CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nWith a view to reaching a full understanding on this subject, the\r\nSecretary of War notified[230] General Andrew Jackson, Governor\r\nMcMinn of Tennessee, and General David Merriwether that they had been\r\nappointed commissioners for the purpose of holding a treaty with the\r\nCherokees on or about the 20th of June, 1817.[231] In pursuance of\r\nthese instructions a conference was called and held at the Cherokee\r\nAgency, which resulted in the treaty of July 8, 1817.[232] By this\r\ntreaty the Cherokees ceded two large tracts of country[233] in exchange\r\nfor one of equal area on the Arkansas and White Rivers adjoining\r\nthe territory of the Osages. The Cherokees also ceded two small\r\nreservations made by the treaty of January 7, 1806.[234]\r\n\r\nThe large cession by the first article of the treaty of 1817,\r\nthough partially in Georgia, was at the time supposed to cover all\r\nthe territory claimed by the Cherokees within the limits of North\r\nCarolina,[235] and was secured in deference to the urgent importunities\r\nof the legislature and people of that State. It was subsequently\r\nascertained that this supposition was incorrect.\r\n\r\n_Majority of Cherokees averse to removal._--During the conference, but\r\nbefore the negotiations had reached any definite result, a memorial was\r\npresented to the United States commissioners, signed by sixty-seven\r\nof the chiefs and headmen of the nation, setting forth that the\r\ndelegation of their nation who in 1809 visited Washington and discussed\r\nwith President Jefferson the proposition for an exchange of lands had\r\nacted without any delegated authority on the subject. The memorialists\r\nclaimed to represent the prevailing feeling of the nation and were\r\ndesirous of remaining upon and retaining the country of their nativity.\r\nThey were distressed with the alternative proposals to remove to the\r\nArkansas country or remain and become citizens of the United States.\r\nWhile they had not attained a sufficient degree of civilization to fit\r\nthem for the duties of citizenship, they yet deprecated a return to the\r\nsame savage state and surroundings which had characterized their mode\r\nof life when first brought in contact with the whites. They therefore\r\nrequested that the subject should not be further pressed, but that they\r\nmight be enabled to remain in peaceable possession of the land of their\r\nfathers.[236]\r\n\r\nThe commissioners, however, proceeded with their negotiations, and\r\nconcluded the treaty as previously set forth, which was finally signed\r\nby twenty-two of the chiefs and headmen whose names appeared attached\r\nto the memorial, as well as six others, on behalf of the eastern\r\nportion of the nation, and by fifteen chiefs representing those on\r\nthe Arkansas.[237] The treaty was submitted to the Senate, for its\r\nadvice and consent, at the ensuing session of Congress, and although\r\nit encountered the hostility of those Senators who were opposed to\r\nthe general policy of an exchange of lands with the Indians, and of\r\nsome who argued, because of the few chiefs who had signed it, that\r\nit did not represent the full and free expression of their national\r\nassent,[238] that body approved its provisions, and the President\r\nratified and proclaimed it on the 26th of December, 1817.\r\n\r\n_A portion of the Cherokees emigrate west._--Immediately upon the\r\nsigning of the treaty, the United States authorities, presuming upon\r\nits final ratification, took measures for carrying into effect the\r\nscheme of emigration. Within a month Agent Meigs reported that over 700\r\nCherokees had already enrolled themselves for removal the ensuing fall.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of War entered into a contract for 60 boats, to be\r\ndelivered by 1st of November at points between the mouths of the Little\r\nTennessee and Sequatchie Rivers, together with rifles, ammunition,\r\nblankets, and provisions;[239] and, under the control and directions\r\nof Governor McMinn, of Tennessee, the stream of emigration began to\r\nflow, increasing in volume until within the next year over 3,000 had\r\nemigrated to their new homes, which numbers had during the year 1819\r\nincreased to 6,000.[240]\r\n\r\n_Persecution of those favorable to emigration._--There can be no\r\nquestion that a very large portion, and probably a majority, of the\r\nCherokee Nation residing east of the Mississippi had been and still\r\ncontinued bitterly opposed to the terms of the treaty of 1817. They\r\nviewed with jealous and aching hearts all attempts to drive them from\r\nthe homes of their ancestors, for they could not but consider the\r\nconstant and urgent importunities of the Federal authorities in the\r\nlight of an imperative demand for the cession of more territory. They\r\nfelt that they were, as a nation, being slowly but surely compressed\r\nwithin the contracting coils of the giant anaconda of civilization; yet\r\nthey held to the vain hope that a spirit of justice and mercy would be\r\nborn of their helpless condition which would finally prevail in their\r\nfavor. Their traditions furnished them no guide by which to judge of\r\nthe results certain to follow such a conflict as that in which they\r\nwere engaged.\r\n\r\nThis difference of sentiment in the nation upon a subject so vital\r\nto their welfare was productive of much bitterness and violent\r\nanimosities. Those who had favored the emigration scheme and had been\r\ninduced, either through personal preference or by the subsidizing\r\ninfluences of the Government agents, to favor the conclusion of the\r\ntreaty, became the object of scorn and hatred to the remainder of the\r\nnation. They were made the subjects of a persecution so relentless,\r\nwhile they remained in the eastern country, that it was never\r\nforgotten, and when, in the natural course of events, the remainder of\r\nthe nation were forced to remove to the Arkansas country and join the\r\nearlier emigrants, the old hatreds and dissensions broke out afresh,\r\nand to this day they find lodgment in some degree in the breasts of\r\ntheir descendants.\r\n\r\n_Dissatisfaction with the treaty of 1817._--The dissatisfaction with\r\nthe treaty of 1817 took shape in the assemblage of a council at Amoha,\r\nin the Cherokee Nation, in September of the same year, at which six of\r\nthe principal men were selected as a deputation to visit the President\r\nat Washington and present to him in person a detailed statement of the\r\ngrievances and indignities to which they had been subjected in greater\r\nor less degree for many years and to ask relief and redress.\r\n\r\nThey were to present, with special particularity, to the President's\r\nnotice a statement of the improper methods and influences that had been\r\nused to secure the apparent consent of the nation to the treaty of\r\n1817. They were authorized to enter into a new treaty with the United\r\nStates, in lieu of the recent one, in which an alteration might be\r\nmade in certain articles of it, and some additional article inserted\r\nrelative to the mode of payment of their annuity as between the Eastern\r\nand Arkansas Cherokees.[241]\r\n\r\nThe delegation was received and interviews were accorded them by the\r\nPresident and Secretary of War, but they secured nothing but general\r\nexpressions of good will and promises of protection in their rights and\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 224: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 156.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 225: Confidential message of President Jefferson to Congress,\r\nJanuary 18, 1803.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 226: The letter of President Jefferson authorizing a\r\ndelegation of Cherokees to visit the Arkansas and White River country\r\nwas dated January 9, 1809, and will be found in the American State\r\nPapers, Indian Affairs, Vol. II, p. 125, as well as among the records\r\nof the Indian Office.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 227: January 9, 1817.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 228: Letter of Secretary of War to General Jackson, May 14,\r\n1817.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 229: In a letter to Return J. Meigs, under date of September\r\n18, 1816, the Secretary of War says that \"the difficulties which\r\nhave arisen between the Cherokees and the Osages, on the north of\r\nthe Arkansas, and with the Quapaws, on the south, cannot be finally\r\nsettled until the line of the cession shall be run and the rights\r\nof the Quapaws shall be ascertained. Commissioners appointed by the\r\nPresident are now sitting at Saint Louis for the adjustment of those\r\ndifferences; but should the line of the Osage treaty prove that\r\nthey are settled upon the Osage lands, nothing can be done for the\r\nCherokees. It is known to you and to that nation that the condition\r\nupon which the emigration was permitted by the President was that a\r\ncession of Cherokee lands should be made equal to the proportion which\r\nthe emigrants should bear to the whole nation. This condition has\r\nnever been complied with on the part of the nation, and of course all\r\nobligation on the part of the United States to secure the emigrants in\r\ntheir new possessions has ceased. When the subject was mentioned to the\r\nCherokee deputation last winter, so far were they from acknowledging\r\nits force, that they declared the emigrants should be compelled to\r\nreturn.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 230: May 14, 1817.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 231: On the 17th of May, 1817, these commissioners were\r\nadvised that the lands proposed to be given the Cherokees on the west\r\nof the Mississippi River, in exchange for those then occupied by them,\r\nwere the lands on the Arkansas and immediately adjoining the Osage\r\nboundary line.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 232: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 156.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 233: These tracts are designated on the accompanying map as\r\nNos. 23 and 24.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 234: These tracts are designated on the accompanying map as\r\nNos. 25 and 26.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 235: August 1, 1817, the Secretary of War advised the\r\ngovernor of North Carolina that a treaty with the Cherokees had been\r\nconcluded, by which the Indian claim was relinquished to a tract of\r\ncountry including the whole of the land claimed by them in North\r\nCarolina.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 236: This memorial bore date of July 2, 1817.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 237: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 156.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: Letter of Secretary of War to Treaty Commissioners\r\nAugust 1, 1817.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: Letters of Secretary of War to General Jackson and\r\nColonel Meigs, August 9, 1817.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: Letter of Governor McMinn to Secretary of War, November\r\n29, 1818, and subsequent correspondence during 1819.

C., between John C. Calhoun,\r\n    Secretary of War, specially authorized therefor by the President\r\n    of the United States, and the chiefs and headmen of the Cherokee\r\n    Nation of Indians._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\n1. The Cherokee Nation cedes to the United States all of their lands\r\nlying north and east of the following line, viz: Beginning on the\r\nTennessee River at the point where the Cherokee boundary with Madison\r\nCounty, in the Alabama Territory, joins the same; thence along the main\r\nchannel of said river to the mouth of the Highwassee; thence along its\r\nmain channel to the first hill which closes in on said river, about two\r\nmiles above Highwassee Old Town; thence along the ridge which divides\r\nthe waters of the Highwassee and Little Tellico to the Tennessee River\r\nat Talassee; thence along the main channel to the junction of the Cowee\r\nand Nanteyalee; thence along the ridge in the fork of said river to\r\nthe top of the Blue Ridge; thence along the Blue Ridge to the Unicoy\r\nTurnpike Road; thence by straight line to the nearest main source of\r\nthe Chestatee; thence along its main channel to the Chattahouchee; and\r\nthence to the Creek boundary; it being understood that all the islands\r\nin the Chestatee, and the parts of the Tennessee and Highwassee (with\r\nthe exception of Jolly's Island, in the Tennessee, near the mouth of\r\nthe Highwassee) which constitute a portion of the present boundary,\r\nbelong to the Cherokee Nation; and it is also understood that the\r\nreservations contained in the second article of the treaty of Tellico,\r\nsigned the twenty-fifth October, eighteen hundred and five, and a tract\r\nequal to twelve miles square, to be located by commencing at the point\r\nformed by the intersection of the boundary line of Madison County\r\nalready mentioned and the north bank of the Tennessee River, thence\r\nalong the said line and up the said river twelve miles, are ceded\r\nto the United States, in trust for the Cherokee Nation, as a school\r\nfund, to be sold by the United States, and the proceeds vested as is\r\nhereafter provided in the fourth article of this treaty; and also that\r\nthe rights vested in the Unicoy Turnpike Company by the Cherokee Nation\r\n* * * are not to be affected by this treaty.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing cessions are understood and declared to be in full\r\nsatisfaction of all claims of the United States upon the Cherokees on\r\naccount of the cession to a part of their nation who have emigrated\r\nor who may emigrate to the Arkansas and as a final adjustment of the\r\ntreaty of July 8, 1817.\r\n\r\n2. The United States agree to pay, according to the treaty of July 8,\r\n1817, for all valuable improvements on land within the country ceded by\r\nthe Cherokees, and to allow a reservation of 640 acres to each head of\r\na family (not enrolled for removal to Arkansas) who elects to become a\r\ncitizen of the United States.\r\n\r\n3. Each person named in a list accompanying the treaty shall have a\r\nreserve of 640 acres in fee simple, to include his improvements, upon\r\ngiving notice within six months to the agent of his intention to reside\r\npermanently thereon. Various other reservations in fee simple are made\r\nto persons therein named.\r\n\r\n4. The reservations and 12-mile tract reserved for a school fund in\r\nthe first article are to be sold by the United States and the proceeds\r\ninvested in good stocks, the interest of which shall be expended in\r\neducational benefits for the Cherokees east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n5. The boundary lines of the land ceded by the first article shall be\r\nestablished by commissioners appointed by the United States and the\r\nCherokees. Leases made under the treaty of 1817 of land within the\r\nCherokee country shall be void. All white people intruding upon the\r\nlands reserved by the Cherokees shall be removed by the United States,\r\nunder the act of March 30, 1802.\r\n\r\n6. Annuities shall be distributed in the proportion of two-thirds to\r\nthose east to one-third to those west of the Mississippi. Should the\r\nlatter object within one year to this proportion, a census shall be\r\ntaken of both portions of the nation to adjust the matter.\r\n\r\n7. The United States shall prevent intrusion on the ceded lands prior\r\nto January 1, 1820.\r\n\r\n8. The treaty shall be binding upon its ratification.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEES WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI--THEIR WANTS AND CONDITION.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1818 a representative delegation from that portion of the\r\nCherokees who had removed to the Arkansas visited Washington with the\r\nview of reaching a more satisfactory understanding concerning the\r\nlocation and extent of their newly acquired homes in that region. As\r\nearly as January 14 of that year, they had addressed a memorial to the\r\nSecretary of War asking, among other things, that the United States\r\nshould recognize them as a separate and distinct people, clothed with\r\nthe power to frame and administer their own laws, after the manner of\r\ntheir brethren east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nLong and patient hearings were accorded to this delegation by the\r\nauthorities of the Government, and, predicated upon their requests,\r\ninstructions were issued[243] to Governor William Clark, superintendent\r\nof Indian affairs at Saint Louis, among other things, to secure a\r\ncessation of hostilities then raging between the Arkansas Cherokees\r\nand the Osages; furthermore, to induce, if possible, the Shawnees\r\nand Delawares then residing in the neighborhood of Cape Girardeau to\r\nrelinquish their land and join the Western Cherokees, or, in the event\r\nof a favorable termination of the Quapaw treaty then pending, that they\r\nmight be located on lands acquired from them.\r\n\r\nDuring the year the Arkansas Cherokees had also learned that the\r\nOneidas of New York were desirous of obtaining a home in the West,\r\nand had made overtures for their settlement among them.[244] The main\r\nobject of the Cherokees in desiring to secure these originally eastern\r\nIndians for close neighbors is to be found in the increased strength\r\nthey would be able to muster in sustaining their quarrel with their\r\nnative western neighbors.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting in this connection to note the fact that in 1825\r\nthe Cherokees sent a delegation to Wapakoneta, Ohio, accompanied by\r\ncertain Western Shawnees, whose mission was to induce the Shawnees\r\nat that point to join them in the West. Governor Lewis Cass, under\r\ninstructions from the War Department, held a council at Wapakoneta,\r\nlasting nine days,[245] having in view the accomplishment of this end,\r\nbut it was unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nGovernor Clark was also advised by his instructions of the desire of\r\nthe Cherokees to secure an indefinite outlet west, in order that they\r\nshould not in the future, by the encroachments of the whites and the\r\ndiminution of game, be deprived of uninterrupted access to the more\r\nremote haunts of the buffalo and other large game animals. He was\r\ninstructed to do everything consistent with justice in the matter to\r\nfavor the Cherokees by securing from the Osages the concession of such\r\na privilege, it being the object of the President that every favorable\r\ninducement should be held out to the Cherokees east of the Mississippi\r\nto remove and join their western brethren. This extension of their\r\nterritory to the west was promised them by the President in the near\r\nfuture, and in the summer of 1819[246] the Secretary of War instructed\r\nReuben Lewis, United States Indian agent, to assure the Cherokees that\r\nthe President, through the recent accession of territory from the\r\nOsages, was ready and willing to fulfill his promise.\r\n\r\n_Survey of east boundary of Cherokees in Arkansas._--Provision having\r\nbeen made in the treaty of 1817[247] for a definition of the east\r\nline of the tract assigned the Cherokees on the Arkansas, Mr. Reuben\r\nLewis, the Indian agent in that section, was designated, in the fall of\r\n1818,[248] to run and mark the line, and upon its completion to cause\r\nto be removed, without delay, all white settlers living west thereof,\r\nwith the single exception mentioned in the treaty.\r\n\r\nThese instructions to Mr. Lewis miscarried in the mails and did\r\nnot reach him until the following summer. The line had in the mean\r\ntime been run by General William Rector, under the authority of the\r\nCommissioner of the General Land Office, which survey Mr. Lewis was\r\nauthorized to accept as the correct boundary provided the Cherokees\r\nwere satisfied therewith.[249] The field notes of this survey were\r\ncertified by General Rector April 14, 1819, and show the length of the\r\nline from Point Remove to White River to have been 71 miles 55 chains\r\nand the course N. 53° E.[250]\r\n\r\n_Treaty between Cherokees and Osages._--During this interval[251]\r\nGovernor Clark had succeeded in securing the presence at Saint Louis\r\nof representative delegations of both the Osage and Western Cherokee\r\ntribes, between whom, after protracted negotiations, he succeeded in\r\nestablishing the most peaceful and harmonious relations, which were\r\nevidenced by all the usual formalities of a treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPUTES AMONG CHEROKEES CONCERNING EMIGRATION.\r\n\r\nThe unhappy differences of mind among the Cherokees east of the\r\nMississippi on the subject of removal, which had been fast approaching\r\na climax as a consequence of the treaty of 1817, had been rather\r\nstimulated than otherwise by the frequent departure of parties for\r\ntheir new western home, and the constant importunities of the United\r\nStates and State officials (frequently bearing the semblance of\r\nthreats) having in view the removal of the entire tribe. The many\r\nand open acts of violence practiced by the \"home\" as against the\r\n\"emigration\" party at length called forth[252] a vigorous letter\r\nof denunciation from the Secretary of War to Governor McMinn, the\r\nemigration superintendent. After detailing at much length the many\r\nadvantages that would accrue to the Cherokee Nation by a removal beyond\r\nthe contaminating influences always attendant upon the contact of a\r\nrude and barbarous people with a higher type of civilization, the\r\nunselfish and fatherly interest the Government of the United States\r\nhad always manifested and still felt in the comfort and progress of\r\nthe Cherokee people, and the great degree of liberality that had\r\ncharacterized its action in securing for the Cherokees in their new\r\nhomes an indefinite outlet to the bountiful hunting grounds of the\r\nWest, the Secretary concluded by an expression of the determination on\r\nthe part of the United States to protect at all hazards from insult\r\nand injury to person or property every Cherokee who should express an\r\nopinion or take action favorable to the scheme of emigration. He also\r\ninstructed Governor McMinn to lose no opportunity of impressing upon\r\nthe minds of the Cherokees that the practical effect of a complete\r\nexecution of the treaty of 1817 would be, as had been the intention\r\nof the Government when it was negotiated, to compel them either to\r\nremove to the Arkansas or to accept individual reservations and become\r\ncitizens of the States within whose limits they respectively resided.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SENTIMENT IN TENNESSEE AND GEORGIA CONCERNING CHEROKEE REMOVAL.\r\n\r\nGovernor McMinn, being the executive of the State of Tennessee, could\r\nhardly be supposed to present the views of the Secretary of War to the\r\nCherokees on the subject of their removal in milder terms or manner\r\nthan they had been communicated to him. The public officer in that\r\nState who should have neglected such an opportunity of compelling\r\nthe Cherokees to appreciate the benefits of a wholesale emigration\r\nto the West would have fared but ill at the polls in a contest for\r\nre-election. The people of both Tennessee and Georgia were unalterably\r\ndetermined that the Indians should be removed from their States, and no\r\ncompromise or temporary expedient of delay would satisfy their demands.\r\n\r\nMillions of acres of valuable lands, rich in all the elements\r\nthat combine to satisfy the necessities and the desires of the\r\nhusbandman--mountain, valley, and plain--comprising every variety\r\nof soil, fertilized by innumerable running streams and clothed with\r\nheavy forests of the finest timber, were yet in the possession of\r\nthe native tribes of this region. Other lands in great quantities,\r\navailable for white settlement and occupation, both in Kentucky and\r\nthe adjoining States, were, it is true, lying idle. In point of soil,\r\nwater, and timber they were doubtless equal if not superior to the\r\nIndian possessions. But the idea was all-prevalent then as it is now\r\nin border communities, that, however attractive may be the surrounding\r\ndistricts of public lands open to the inclination of anybody who\r\ndesires to settle thereon, the prohibited domain of a neighboring\r\nIndian reservation must of necessity surpass it, and no application of\r\nthe principles of reason, philosophy, or justice will serve to lessen\r\nthe desire for its possession. Governor McMinn convened[253] a council\r\nof the Cherokees, at which he presented to them in the strongest light\r\nthe benefits that would accrue to their nation in the increasing\r\nhappiness, prosperity, and population such as would attend their\r\nremoval to the Arkansas, while, on the other hand, nothing but evil\r\ncould follow their continued residence east of the Mississippi. Their\r\nlands would be constantly encroached upon by white settlers; border\r\ndesperadoes would steal their stock, corrupt their women, and besot\r\ntheir warriors. However anxious the Government might be to protect them\r\nin the uninterrupted enjoyment of their present possessions, it would,\r\nfrom the circumstances of the case, be utterly unable to do so. He\r\ntherefore proposed to them that they should, as a unit, agree to remove\r\nwest of the Mississippi, and that the United States should pay them\r\nfor their lands the sum of $100,000, in addition to all expenses of\r\nremoval; which amount, upon their prompt and indignant refusal, he at\r\nonce offered to double, but with as small measure of success.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of 1817 had made provision for the taking of a census of\r\nthe whole Cherokee people during the month of June of the following\r\nyear. The census was to form the basis for an equitable distribution of\r\nthe annuities and other benefits of which the Cherokee Nation was in\r\nreceipt, between the portion who continued to abide in their eastern\r\nhomes and those who had removed to the Arkansas country, in proportion\r\nto their respective numbers. Pending this enumeration no annuities had\r\nbeen paid them, which produced much annoyance and dissatisfaction among\r\nboth parties.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the hostile and vindictive attitude manifested\r\ntoward the emigrant party by the remainder of the nation and the many\r\nobstacles sought to be thrown in the path of removal, the authorities\r\nof the United States had hitherto refused to comply with the census\r\nprovision of the treaty of 1817. Governor McMinn, after the rejection\r\nof both his purchase and his removal propositions, then proposed (in\r\nanswer to the demand of the Cherokee council that he should cause the\r\ncensus to be taken in the manner provided) that if they would pass a\r\nformal vote of censure upon such of their officers as he should name\r\nas having violated the treaty by the use of intimidating measures\r\nagainst the Arkansas emigrants, he would cause the work of taking\r\nthe census to be at once begun. The council also declined to do this,\r\nadmitting that if such conduct had characterized any of their officers\r\nit was deserving of censure but denying that any proof of the charges\r\nhad been submitted. They at last, however, as an evidence of their\r\ngood disposition toward the United States, consented to the removal\r\nof one of the offensive officers named from his position as a member\r\nof the council, and the Secretary of War authorized[254] the taking\r\nof the census to be proceeded with. Governor McMinn, in summing up\r\nthe results of this council,[255] assumes that about one-half of the\r\nnation had already committed themselves to the policy outlined in\r\nthe treaty of 1817, by the fact that since December 28 of that year\r\n718 families had enrolled themselves for removal (aggregating, with\r\nthose already removed, 5,291 individuals), besides 146 families who\r\nhad elected to take reservations in severalty. The lack of tangible\r\nresults following this council was promptly reported to the Secretary\r\nof War by both Governor McMinn and Agent Meigs. The latter advised the\r\nauthorities[256] that a fully authorized and representative delegation\r\nof the Cherokee Nation would shortly proceed to Washington, and that,\r\nin his judgment, the nation was rapidly becoming satisfied of their\r\ninability to long postpone what to every impartial observer must appear\r\nas inevitable--an exchange of their country for a location west of the\r\nMississippi River.\r\n\r\nThis delegation in due time[257] arrived at the capital, and a series\r\nof councils or interviews was at once entered upon between themselves\r\nand the Secretary of War, as representing the President. Many and\r\njust were the causes of complaint presented to the Secretary by the\r\ndelegation. The recital of their wrongs, the deep affection manifested\r\nfor their native hills and streams, and the superstitious dread with\r\nwhich they looked upon removal to a new country as being the decisive\r\nstep in their dispersion and destruction as a people were calculated to\r\nexcite the sympathy of an unprejudiced mind. It had long been evident,\r\nhowever, that the simple minded barbarian was unable to cope with the\r\nintelligent and persistent demands of civilization, and that, with or\r\nwithout his consent, the advancing host of white settlers would ere\r\nmany years be in full enjoyment of his present possessions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY CONCLUDED FOR FURTHER CESSION OF LAND.\r\n\r\nAfter several preliminary discussions concerning the best method\r\nof adjusting their difficulties, the Secretary of War submitted\r\nto them,[258] in writing, a statement of the basis upon which the\r\nUnited States would enter into a treaty with them, urging prompt\r\naction thereon, in order that the Senate might have time to exercise\r\nits constitutional functions upon the same prior to its approaching\r\nadjournment.\r\n\r\nThe salient points of this proposition were that the Cherokees should\r\nmake a cession of land in proportion to the estimated number of their\r\nnation who had already removed or enrolled themselves for removal to\r\nthe Arkansas; that the United States preferred the cession to be made\r\nin Tennessee and Georgia, and that in the latter State it should be as\r\nnear and convenient to the existing white settlements as was possible;\r\nthat the reservation which the Cherokees had expressed a desire to make\r\nfor the benefit of a proposed school fund should be located within the\r\nlimits of Alabama Territory, inasmuch as the cession to be made in\r\nGeorgia would, under the provisions of the act of Congress of 1802,\r\nbelong to that State, and the lands covering the proposed cession in\r\nTennessee would be subject to location by North Carolina military\r\nland warrants. Neither was such school reservation to constitute any\r\nportion of the land which the Cherokees were to cede in conformity to\r\nthe principle of exchange embodied in the first paragraph. The United\r\nStates would continue to extend its protection to both branches of\r\nthe Cherokee people, but those remaining east of the Mississippi,\r\nhaving expressed a desire that the lands retained by them should be\r\nabsolutely guaranteed from any danger of future cession, were informed\r\nthat in order to secure such guarantee it was indispensable that the\r\ncessions they were about to make should be ample, and that the portion\r\nof territory reserved by them should not be larger than was essential\r\nto their wants and convenience. The Secretary reminded them that\r\nshould a larger quantity be retained it would not be possible, by any\r\nstipulation in the treaty, to prevent future cessions; that so long as\r\nthey retained more land than was necessary or convenient for themselves\r\nthey would feel inclined to sell and the United States to purchase. He\r\ncommented on the fact that they were rapidly becoming like the white\r\npeople, and could not longer live by hunting, but must work for their\r\nsubsistence. In their new condition of life far less land would be\r\nessential to their happiness. Their great object should be to hold\r\ntheir land by severalty titles and to gradually adopt the manners and\r\nlaws of life which prevailed among their white neighbors. It was only\r\nthus that they could be prosperous and happy, and neglect to accept and\r\nprofit by the situation would inevitably result in their removal or\r\nextinction.\r\n\r\nThe question as to the area of territory that should be ceded as the\r\nequitable proportion of the Arkansas Cherokees formed the subject\r\nof much dispute. The Eastern Cherokees denied the accuracy of the\r\nemigration roll of Governor McMinn, and asserted that, instead of\r\n5,291 emigrants, as stated by him, there had actually been not\r\nexceeding 3,500, while the non-emigrant portion of the nation they\r\ngave as numbering 12,514, or more than three-fourths of the entire\r\ncommunity.[259]\r\n\r\nIt being impossible to reconcile these radical differences of estimate\r\nand the Indians becoming wearied and discouraged with the persistent\r\nimportunities of the United States officials, they consented to the\r\ncession of those tracts of country naively described in the treaty of\r\nFebruary 27, 1819,[260] as \"_at least as extensive_\" as that to which\r\nthe United States was entitled under the principles and provisions\r\nof the treaty of 1817. These cessions were made, as recited in the\r\npreamble to the treaty, as the commencement of those measures necessary\r\nto the civilization and preservation of their nation, and in order\r\nthat the treaty of July 8, 1817, might, without further delay or the\r\ntrouble or expense of taking the census therein provided for, be\r\nfinally adjusted. It was also agreed that the distribution of annuities\r\nshould be made in the proportion of two to one in favor of the Eastern\r\nCherokees (it being assumed that about one-third of the nation had gone\r\nwest), with the proviso that if the Arkansas Cherokees should offer\r\nformal objection to this ratio within one year after the ratification\r\nof the treaty, then a census, solely for the purpose of making a fair\r\ndistribution of the annuity, should be taken at such time and in\r\nsuch manner as the President of the United States should designate.\r\nAll leases of any portion of the territory reserved to the Cherokees\r\nwere declared void, and the removal of all intruders upon their lands\r\nwas promised, to which latter end an order was issued requiring such\r\nremoval to take place on or before July 1, 1819.\r\n\r\nThus was concluded the treaty of February 27, 1819, which was promptly\r\nand favorably acted upon by the Senate and ratified and proclaimed\r\nby the President on the 10th of March following. The gist of such\r\nprovisions of importance as are not detailed in these historical notes\r\nwill be found by reference to the abstract preceding them.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the approval of the treaty by the Senate, the\r\nSecretary of War notified Governor McMinn[261] of the fact, directing\r\nhim to give no further encouragement to emigration to the Arkansas, but\r\nto proceed at once to wind up the business under the treaty of 1817.\r\n\r\n_Survey of boundaries._--Preparations were at once made for surveying\r\nand marking the lines of the cessions. Hon. Wilson Lumpkin, who was\r\nengaged in running the line between East Florida and the State of\r\nGeorgia, was directed[262] to suspend that work, and designated to\r\nsurvey the line of cession, commencing at the point where the Unicoi\r\nTurnpike crossed the Blue Ridge, and thence to the nearest main source\r\nof the Chestatee, and also to lay off the individual reservations that\r\nshould be selected within the State of Georgia.\r\n\r\nThe following day[263] Robert Houston was appointed to run the line of\r\nthe cession within the State of Tennessee, commencing on the Highwassee\r\nRiver about 2 miles above Highwassee Old Town, as well as to survey the\r\nindividual reservations within that State, and also the tracts reserved\r\nin North Carolina and Alabama Territory.\r\n\r\nMr. Houston performed his services as a surveyor to the satisfaction\r\nof all parties;[264] but in running the line from the Unicoi Turnpike\r\ncrossing of the Blue Ridge to the nearest main source of the Chestatee,\r\na dispute arose between Mr. Lumpkin and the Cherokees as to which was\r\nthe nearest main source of that river, the Frogtown or the Tessentee\r\nFork. The surveyor ran the line to the source of the first named fork,\r\nwhile the Indians insisted that the latter was the proper stream, and\r\ndemanded a re-examination of the survey. Agent Meigs having, however,\r\nreported[265] in favor of the correctness of the survey, it was allowed\r\nto stand.[266]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATUS OF CERTAIN CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nEarly in the year 1820[267] complaints began to arise as to the status\r\nof those Cherokees who had made their election to remove to the\r\nArkansas country but had subsequently concluded to remain east. These,\r\nit was stated, numbered 817, and they found themselves placed in rather\r\nan anomalous situation. Their proportion of the Cherokee national\r\ndomain had been ceded to the United States by the treaties of 1817\r\nand 1819. Their share of annuities was being paid, under the treaty\r\nof 1819, to the Cherokees of the Arkansas. Their right to individual\r\nreservations under either treaty was denied, and they were not even\r\nallowed to vote, hold office, or participate in any of the affairs of\r\nthe nation.\r\n\r\nIn this condition they soon became an element of much irritation in the\r\nbody politic of the tribe. The Cherokee authorities urged that they\r\nshould be furnished with rations and transportation to their brethren\r\nin the West, whither they were now willing to remove, but the Secretary\r\nof War instructed Agent Meigs[268] that emigration to the Arkansas\r\nunder the patronage of the Government had ceased, and that those\r\nCherokees who had enrolled themselves for removal but had not yet gone,\r\nas well as all others thereafter determining to go, must do so at their\r\nown expense.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 242: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 195.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 243: May 8, 1818.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 244: Secretary of War to Reuben Lewis, United States Indian\r\nagent, May 16, 1818.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 245: May 16 to 24, inclusive.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: July 22.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 247: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 156.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 248: Letter of Secretary of War to Capt.

C., between James Barbour,\r\n    Secretary of War, specially authorized therefor by the President\r\n    of the United States, and the chiefs and headmen of the Cherokee\r\n    Nation west of the Mississippi._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nThe preamble recites the desire of the United States to secure to the\r\nCherokees, both east and west of the Mississippi, a permanent home,\r\n\"that shall never in all future time be embarrassed by having extended\r\naround it the lines or placed over it the jurisdiction of a Territory\r\nor State, nor be pressed upon by the extension in any way of any of the\r\nlimits of any existing Territory or State.\"\r\n\r\nIt also assumes that their actual surroundings, both east and west of\r\nsuch river, were unadapted to the accomplishment of such a purpose, and\r\ntherefore the following articles of agreement were made:\r\n\r\n1. The western boundary of Arkansas shall be * * * viz: A line shall\r\nbe run commencing on Red River at the point where the Eastern Choctaw\r\nline strikes said river, and run due north with said line to the river\r\nArkansas; thence in a direct line to the southwest corner of Missouri.\r\n\r\n2. The United States agree to possess the Cherokees, and to guarantee\r\nit to them forever, * * * of seven million of acres of land, to be\r\nbounded as follows, viz: Commencing at that point on Arkansas River\r\nwhere the eastern Choctaw boundary lines strikes said river, and\r\nrunning thence with the western line of Arkansas, as defined in the\r\nforegoing article, to the southwest corner of Missouri, and thence with\r\nthe western boundary line of Missouri till it crosses the waters of\r\nNeasho, generally called Grand River; thence due west to a point from\r\nwhich a due-south course will strike the present northwest corner of\r\nArkansas Territory; thence continuing due south on and with the present\r\nwestern boundary line of the Territory to the main branch of Arkansas\r\nRiver; thence down said river to its junction, with the Canadian River,\r\nand thence up and between the said rivers Arkansas and Canadian to a\r\npoint at which a line running north and south from river to river will\r\ngive the aforesaid seven million of acres.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the seven millions of acres thus provided for and\r\nbounded, the United States guarantee to the Cherokee Nation a perpetual\r\noutlet west, and a free and unmolested use of all the country lying\r\nwest of the western boundary of the above described limits and as far\r\nwest as the sovereignty of the United States and their right of soil\r\nextend.\r\n\r\n3. The United States agree to survey the lines of the above cession\r\n\r\n4. The United States agree to appraise and pay the value of all\r\nCherokee improvements abandoned by the latter in their removal; also to\r\nsell the property and improvements connected with the agency, for the\r\nerection of a grist and saw mill in their new home.\r\n\r\n5. The United States agree to pay the Cherokees $50,000 as the\r\ndifference in value between their old and their new lands; also an\r\nannuity for three years of $2,000 to repay cost and trouble of going\r\nafter and recovering stray stock; also $8,760 in full for spoliations\r\ncommitted on them by the Osages or citizens of the United States; also\r\n$1,200 for losses sustained by Thomas Graves, a Cherokee chief; also\r\n$500 to George Guess, the discoverer of the Cherokee alphabet, as well\r\nas the right to occupy a saline; also an annuity of $2,000 for ten\r\nyears to be expended in the education of Cherokee children; also $1,000\r\nfor the purchase of printing press and type; also, the benevolent\r\nsociety engaged in instructing Cherokee children to be allowed the\r\namount expended by it in erection of buildings and improvements; also,\r\nthe United States to release the indebtedness of the Cherokees to the\r\nUnited States factory to an amount not exceeding $3,500.\r\n\r\n6. The United States agree to furnish the Cherokees, when they desire\r\nit, a system of plain laws and to survey their lands for individual\r\nallotment.\r\n\r\n7. The Cherokees agree within fourteen months to leave the lands in\r\nArkansas assigned them by treaties of January 8, 1817, and February 27,\r\n1819.\r\n\r\n8. Each head of a Cherokee family east of the Mississippi desiring to\r\nremove to the country described in the second article hereof to be\r\nfurnished by the United States with a good rifle, a blanket, a kettle,\r\nfive pounds of tobacco, and compensated for all improvements he may\r\nabandon; also a blanket to each member of his family. The United States\r\nto pay expenses of removal and to furnish subsistence for one year\r\nthereafter. Each head of family taking with him four persons to receive\r\n$50.\r\n\r\n9. The United States to have a reservation 2 by 6 miles at Fort Gibson,\r\nwith the right to construct a road leading to and from the same.\r\n\r\n10. Capt. James Rogers to have $500 for property lost and services\r\nrendered to the United States.\r\n\r\n11. Treaty to be binding when ratified.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The Senate consented to the ratification of this treaty with\r\nthe proviso that the \"western outlet\" should not extend north of 36°,\r\nnor to interfere with lands assigned or to be assigned to the Creeks;\r\nneither should anything in the treaty be construed to assign to the\r\nCherokees any lands previously assigned to any other tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nRETURN J. MEIGS AND THE CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nReturn J. Meigs had for nearly twenty years[270] occupied the position\r\nof United States agent for the Cherokee Nation. As a soldier of the\r\nRevolutionary war he had marched with Arnold through the forests of\r\nMaine and Canada to the attack on Quebec in 1775.[271]\r\n\r\nHe had also, by his faithful, intelligent, and honest administration\r\nof the duties of his office as Indian agent, secured the perfect\r\nconfidence of his official superiors through all the mutations of\r\nadministration. He had acquired a knowledge of and familiarity with\r\nthe habits, character, and wants of the Cherokees such as was perhaps\r\npossessed by few, if indeed by any other man.\r\n\r\nAny suggestions, therefore, that he might make concerning the solution\r\nof the Cherokee problem were deserving of grave consideration. His\r\nviews were submitted in detail upon the condition, prospects, and\r\nrequirements of the Cherokee Nation in a communication to the Secretary\r\nof War.[272] To his mind the time had arrived when a radical change in\r\nthe policy of managing their affairs had become essential. Ever since\r\nthe treaty of 1791 the United States, in pursuance of a policy therein\r\noutlined for leading the Cherokees toward the attainment of a higher\r\ndegree of civilization, in becoming herdsmen and cultivators instead\r\nof hunters, had been furnishing each year a supply of implements for\r\nhusbandry and domestic use. In consequence a respectable proportion of\r\nthat nation had become familiarized with the use of the plow, spade,\r\nand hoe. Many of their women had learned the art of spinning and\r\nweaving, and in individual instances considerable progress had been\r\nmade in the accumulation of property. Agent Meigs now thought that\r\nthe point had been reached where the Cherokee people should begin to\r\nfight their own battles of life, and that any further contributions\r\nto their support, either in the shape of provisions or tools, would\r\nhave only a tendency to render them more dependent upon the Government\r\nand less competent to take care of themselves. Those who were already\r\nadvanced in the arts of civilized life should be the tutors of the\r\nmore ignorant. They possessed a territory of perhaps 10,000,000 acres\r\nof land, principally in the States of Georgia, North Carolina, and\r\nTennessee, for the occupation of which they could enumerate little\r\nmore than 10,000 souls or 2,000 families. If they were to become an\r\nagricultural and pastoral people, an assignment of 640 acres of land\r\nto each family would be all and more than they could occupy with\r\nadvantage to themselves. Such an allotment would consume but 1,280,000\r\nacres, leaving more than 8,000,000 acres of surplus land which might\r\nand ought to be sold for their benefit, and the proceeds (which he\r\nestimated at $300,000, to be paid in fifty annual installments) applied\r\nto their needs in the erection of houses, fences, and the clearing\r\nand breaking up of their land for cultivation. The authority and\r\nlaws of the several States within whose limits they resided should\r\nbecome operative upon them, and they should be vested with the rights,\r\nprivileges, and immunities of citizens of those States. These views met\r\nwith the concurrence of the administration, and would possibly have\r\nbeen carried into effect but for the intense hostility thereto of not\r\nonly the unprogressive element among the Cherokees themselves but of\r\nthe officials and people of the States most interested, who could not\r\nview with complacency the permanent occupation of a single acre of land\r\nwithin their limits by the aboriginal owners.\r\n\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE DENIES THE VALIDITY OF CHEROKEE RESERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nAbout this time trouble arose between the authorities of the State of\r\nTennessee and the surveyor (Robert Houston) who had been intrusted\r\nwith the duty of laying off such individual reservations as should\r\nbe taken under the provisions of the treaties of 1817 and 1819. Mr.\r\nHouston reported to the Secretary of War that the legislature of\r\nTennessee had refused to confirm all such reservations taken in virtue\r\nof the provisions of those treaties subsequent to the 1st of July,\r\n1818, or, in other words, after the time provided for taking the\r\nCherokee census had expired, and desired the opinion and instructions\r\nof the Department thereon. The question involved in this dispute was\r\ndeemed of sufficient importance to secure an official opinion from the\r\nAttorney-General prior to directing any further action.[273] An opinion\r\nwas rendered[274] by Attorney-General Wirt, the substance of which was\r\nthat the right of taking these reservations having been in the first\r\ninstance given by the treaty of 1817 until the census should be taken,\r\nand the time for taking the census having been, by the acquiescence\r\nof both parties to the treaty, kept open until the conclusion of the\r\ntreaty of February 27, 1819, all the reservations taken prior to this\r\nlatter date were legal, more especially as they had been ratified by\r\nthe recognition of them contained in the treaty of 1819. Furthermore,\r\nthe second article of that treaty, taken in connection with the seventh\r\narticle, continued the period for taking reservations until the 1st\r\nof January, 1820. Mr. Houston was instructed[275] to proceed to lay\r\noff the reservations in consonance with this opinion, notwithstanding\r\nwhich the authorities of Tennessee took issue therewith and passed a\r\nlaw providing for the sale of the disputed reserves, whereupon the War\r\nDepartment instructed[276] Agent Meigs to cause one or two test cases\r\nto be prepared for trial in the courts.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of these reservations it is pertinent to remark\r\nthat by act of March 3, 1823, Congress appropriated $50,000 to be\r\nexpended in extinguishing the Indian title to such individual fee\r\nsimple reservations as were made within the limits of Georgia by the\r\nCherokee treaties of 1817 and 1819 and by the Creek treaties of 1814\r\nand 1821. James Merriwether and Duncan G. Campbell were appointed\r\nas commissioners to carry the same into effect. Twenty-two thousand\r\ndollars were also appropriated May 9, 1828, to reimburse the State\r\nof North Carolina for the amount expended by her authorities in\r\nextinguishing Cherokee reservation titles in that State under the\r\ntreaties of 1817 and 1819.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES AGREE TO EXTINGUISH INDIAN TITLE IN GEORGIA.\r\n\r\nBy an agreement between the United States and the State of Georgia\r\nbearing date April 24, 1802,[277] Georgia ceded to the United States\r\nall the lands lying south of Tennessee and west of Chattahoochee River\r\nand a line drawn from the mouth of Uchee Creek direct to Nickojack, on\r\nthe Tennessee River. In consideration of this cession the United States\r\nagreed to pay Georgia $1,250,000, and to extinguish the Indian title\r\nwhenever the same could be done on peaceable and reasonable terms; also\r\nto assume the burden of what were known as the Yazoo claims.\r\n\r\n_Georgia charges the United States with bad faith._--Ever since the\r\ndate of this agreement the utmost impatience had been manifested by the\r\nGovernment and the people of the State of Georgia at the deliberate\r\nand careful course which had characterized the action of the General\r\nGovernment in securing relinquishment of their lands in that State\r\nfrom the Creeks and Cherokees. Charges of bad faith on the part of the\r\nUnited States, coupled with threats of taking the matter into their\r\nown hands, had been published in great profusion by the Georgians.\r\nThese served only to enhance the difficulties of the situation and to\r\nexcite a stubborn resistance in the minds of the Indians against any\r\nfurther cessions of territory.\r\n\r\n_Report of Congressional committee._--The subject was brought to\r\nthe attention of Congress through the action of the governor and\r\nlegislature of Georgia. A select committee was appointed by the House\r\nof Representatives, at the first session of the Seventeenth Congress,\r\nto take the matter into consideration and to report whether the said\r\narticles of agreement between that State and the United States had so\r\nfar been executed according to the terms thereof, and what were the\r\nbest means of completing the execution of the same. This committee\r\nsubmitted a report to the House,[278] wherein, after reciting the\r\nterms of the agreement, allusion is made to the Creek treaty of 1814,\r\nand the opinion expressed that the agreement might have been more\r\nsatisfactorily complied with by demanding the cession at that treaty of\r\nthe Creek lands within Georgia's limits, instead of accepting in large\r\nmeasure those within the Territory of Alabama. The Indians were by this\r\naction forced, in the opinion of the committee, within the limits of\r\nGeorgia, instead of being withdrawn therefrom.\r\n\r\nRespecting the Cherokee treaty of July 8, 1817, the committee say that\r\nsome time previous to its conclusion the Cherokees had represented to\r\nthe President that their upper and lower towns wished to separate;\r\nthat the Upper Cherokees desired to be confined to a smaller section\r\nof country and to engage in the pursuits of agriculture and civilized\r\nlife; that the Lower Cherokees preferred continuing the hunter's life,\r\nand, owing to the scarcity of game in their own country, proposed to\r\nexchange it for land on the west of the Mississippi River; that to\r\ncarry into effect these wishes of the Indians the treaty of 1817 was\r\nheld, and the United States then had it in their power to have so far\r\ncomplied with their contract with Georgia as to have extinguished the\r\ntitle of the Cherokees to most of their lands within the limits of\r\nthat State; that this could readily have been done, for the reason\r\nthat the Upper Cherokees resided beyond the boundaries of Georgia,\r\nand had expressed a desire to retain lands on the Hiwassee River,\r\nin Tennessee, whilst the Lower Cherokees, who were desirous of\r\nemigrating west, mostly resided in the former State. But, in spite of\r\nthis opportunity, the United States had purchased an inconsiderable\r\ntract of country in Georgia and a very considerable one in Tennessee,\r\napparently in opposition to the wishes of the Indians, the interests\r\nof Georgia, and of good faith in themselves. By this treaty the United\r\nStates had also granted a reservation of 640 acres to each head of\r\nan Indian family who should elect to remain on the eastern side of\r\nthe Mississippi. This the committee viewed as an attempt on the part\r\nof the United States to grant lands in fee simple within the limits\r\nof Georgia in direct violation of the rights of that State. The\r\nprovision permitting Cherokees to become citizens of the United States\r\nwas also characterized as an unwarrantable disregard of the rights\r\nof Congress. It was further asserted that by the treaty of 1819 the\r\nUnited States had shown a disposition and determination to permanently\r\nfix the Cherokee Indians upon the soil of Georgia, and thereby render\r\nit impossible to comply with their contract with that State. Yet\r\nanother feature of this treaty too objectionable to be overlooked was\r\nthe agreement of the United States that 12 miles square of land ceded\r\nby the Indians should be disposed of and the proceeds invested for\r\nthe establishment of a school fund for those Indians. In conclusion\r\nthe committee suggested that in order to a proper execution of the\r\nagreement with Georgia it would be necessary for the United States\r\nto relinquish the policy they had apparently adopted with regard to\r\ncivilizing the Indians and keeping them permanently on their lands, at\r\nleast in respect to the Creeks and Cherokees, and that appropriations\r\nshould be made from time to time sufficiently large to enable the\r\nGovernment to hold treaties with those Indians for the extinguishment\r\nof their title.\r\n\r\n_Commissioners appointed to negotiate a new treaty._--Stimulated by\r\nthe sentiments so strongly expressed in this report of a committee of\r\nthe House of Representatives, the executive authorities determined to\r\nmake another effort to secure a further cession of territory from the\r\nCherokees.\r\n\r\nAccordingly the President appointed[279] General John Floyd, Maj.\r\nFreeman Walker, and Hon. J. A. Cuthbert, all of Georgia, commissioners\r\nto negotiate a treaty with that nation, and advised them of his earnest\r\ndesire that a cession should be secured from the Indians such as\r\nwould prove satisfactory to that State. Messrs. Walker and Cuthbert\r\ndeclined their appointments, and Duncan G. Campbell and General David\r\nMerriwether were appointed[280] in their places. General Merriwether\r\ndying shortly after, was succeeded by Maj. James Merriwether, whom it\r\nhad been the original intention to appoint, but for whose name that\r\nof General Merriwether had been inserted in the primary appointment\r\nthrough mistake. Before any active steps had been taken toward the\r\nperformance of the duties assigned the commission, General Floyd\r\nresigned,[281] and the President determined to allow the remaining\r\ntwo members to constitute the full commission. Their appointment was\r\nsubmitted to and approved[282] by the Senate, and in the transmission\r\nof their new commissions by the Secretary of War perseverance and\r\njudicious management were enjoined upon them as essential to success\r\nin their negotiations. It would seem that all their perseverance was\r\nneeded, for the commissioners were unable to secure even an interview\r\nwith the Cherokee authorities until a date and place had been\r\ndesignated for the fourth time.\r\n\r\n_Death of Agent Meigs._--About this time[283] Agent Meigs, who since\r\n1801 had represented the Government with the Cherokees, died, and\r\nex-Governor McMinn, of Tennessee, was appointed[284] to succeed him.\r\n\r\n_Failure to conclude proposed treaty._--The treaty commissioners\r\nfinally met the council of the Cherokee Nation at Newtown, their\r\ncapital, on the 4th of October, 1823.[285] They were also accompanied\r\nby Johnson Wellborn and James Blair, who had been appointed by the\r\ngovernor of Georgia as commissioners to advance the interests and\r\nprotect the rights of that State. The negotiations were all conducted\r\nin writing, and form an interesting chapter in the history of the\r\nmethods used throughout a long series of years to secure from the\r\nCherokees, by \"voluntary, peaceful, and reasonable means,\" the\r\nrelinquishment of their ancestral territory. The commissioners set\r\nforth their desire to procure the cession of a tract of country\r\ncomprising all to which the Cherokees laid claim lying north and east\r\nof a line to begin at a marked corner at the head of Chestatee River,\r\nthence along the ridge to the mouth of Long Swamp Creek, thence down\r\nthe Etowah River to the line to be run between Alabama and Georgia,\r\nthence with that line to the dividing line between the Creeks and\r\nCherokees, and thence with the latter line to the Chattahoochee. In\r\nconsideration of this proposed cession, the commissioners agreed that\r\nthe United States should pay the sum of $200,000 and also indemnify the\r\nnation against the Georgia depredation claims, as well as the further\r\nsum of $10,000 to be paid immediately upon the signing of the treaty.\r\n\r\nTo this proposition, in spite of the threatening language used by the\r\ncommissioners, the Indians invariably and repeatedly returned the\r\nanswer, \"We beg leave to present this communication as a positive and\r\nunchangeable refusal to dispose of one foot more of land.\"[286]\r\n\r\nThe commissioners, seeing the futility of further negotiations,\r\nadjourned _sine die_,[287] and a report of their proceedings was made\r\nby Commissioner Campbell thirty days later, Major Merriwether having in\r\nthe mean time resigned.\r\n\r\n_Cherokees ask protection against Georgia's demands._--Shortly\r\nfollowing these attempted negotiations, which had produced in the\r\nminds of the Indians a feeling of grave uneasiness and uncertainty, a\r\ndelegation of Cherokees repaired to Washington for a conference with\r\nthe President touching the situation. Upon receiving their credentials,\r\nthe Secretary of War sounded the key-note of the Government's purpose\r\nby asking if they had come authorized by their nation to treat for\r\na further relinquishment of territory. To this pointed inquiry the\r\ndelegation returned a respectful and earnest memorial,[288] urging that\r\ntheir nation labored under a peculiar inconvenience from the repeated\r\nappropriations made by Congress for the purpose of holding treaties\r\nwith them having in view the further purchase of lands. Such action had\r\nresulted in much injury to the improvement of the nation in the arts of\r\ncivilized life by unsettling the minds and prospects of its citizens.\r\nTheir nation had reached the decisive and unalterable conclusion to\r\ncede no more lands, the limits preserved to them by the treaty of 1819\r\nbeing not more than adequate to their comfort and convenience. It was\r\nrepresented as a gratifying truth that the Cherokees were rapidly\r\nincreasing in number, rendering it a duty incumbent upon the nation to\r\npreserve, unimpaired to posterity, the lands of their ancestors. They\r\ntherefore implored the interposition of the President with Congress\r\nin behalf of their nation, so that provision might be made by law to\r\nauthorize an adjustment between the United States and the State of\r\nGeorgia, releasing the former from its compact with the latter so far\r\nas it respected the extinguishment of the Cherokee title to land within\r\nthe chartered limits of that State.\r\n\r\nThe response[289] of the Secretary of War to this memorial was a\r\nreiteration of the terms of the compact with Georgia and of the zealous\r\ndesire of the President to carry out in full measure the obligations of\r\nthat compact. The manifest benefits and many happy results that would\r\ninure to the Cherokee Nation from an exchange of their country for\r\none beyond the limits of any State and far removed from the annoying\r\nencroachments of civilization were pictured in the most attractive\r\ncolors, but all to no purpose, the Cherokees only maintaining with\r\nmore marked emphasis their original determination to part with no more\r\nland. Seeing the futility of further negotiations, the Secretary of War\r\naddressed[290] a communication to the governor of Georgia advising him\r\nof the earnest efforts that had been made to secure further concessions\r\nfrom the Cherokees and of the discouraging results, and inviting an\r\nexpression of opinion from him upon the subject.\r\n\r\n_Governor Troup's threatening demands._--Governor Troup lost no time in\r\nresponding to this invitation by submitting[291] a declaration of views\r\non behalf of the government and people of the State of Georgia, the\r\nvigorously aggressive tone of which in some measure perhaps compensated\r\nfor its lack of logical force. After censuring the General Government\r\nfor the tardiness and weakness that had characterized its action on\r\nthis subject throughout a series of years and denying that the Indians\r\nwere anything but mere tenants at will, he laid down the proposition\r\nthat Georgia was determined at all hazards to become possessed of the\r\nCherokee domain; that if the Indians persisted in their refusal to\r\nyield, the consequences would be that the United States must either\r\nassist the Georgians in occupying the country which is their own and\r\nwhich is unjustly withheld from them, or, in resisting the occupation,\r\nto make war upon and shed the blood of brothers and friends. He further\r\ndeclared that the proposition to permit the Cherokees to reserve a\r\nportion of their land within that State for their future home could\r\nnot be legitimately entertained by the General Government except with\r\nthe consent of Georgia; that such consent would never be given; and,\r\nfurther that the suggestion of the incorporation of the Indians into\r\nthe body politic of that State as citizens was neither desirable\r\nnor practicable. The conclusion of this remarkable state paper is\r\ncharacterized by a broadly implied threat that Georgia's fealty to\r\nthe Union would be proportioned to the vigor and alertness with which\r\nmeasures were adopted and carried into effect by the United States for\r\nthe extinguishment of the Cherokee title.\r\n\r\n_Response of President Monroe._--These criticisms by the executive of\r\nGeorgia, which were sanctioned and in large measure reiterated by the\r\nlegislature and by the Congressional delegation of that State,[292]\r\ncalled forth[293] from President Monroe a message to Congress upon\r\nthe subject in defense of the course that had been pursued by the\r\nexecutive authorities of the United States. Accompanying this message\r\nwas a report[294] from John C. Calhoun, Secretary of War, wherein it\r\nis alleged that at the date of the compact of 1802 between the United\r\nStates and Georgia the two Indian nations living within the limits\r\nof that State (the Creeks and the Cherokees) were respectively in\r\npossession of 19,578,890 and 7,152,110 acres of territory. At the date\r\nof such compact, treaties existed between the United States and those\r\ntribes defining the limits of their territories. In fulfillment of the\r\nstipulation with Georgia, seven treaties had been held with them, five\r\nof which were with the Creeks and two with the Cherokees. The lands\r\nthus acquired from the former in Georgia amounted to 14,449,480 acres\r\nand from the latter to 995,310 acres. In acquiring these cessions\r\nfor the State of Georgia the United States had expended $958,945.90,\r\nto which should be added the value of the 995,310 acres given by the\r\nCherokees in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi, the estimated\r\nvalue of which, at the minimum price of public lands, would amount to\r\n$1,244,137.50. The United States had also (in addition to $1,250,000\r\npaid to Georgia as a part of the original consideration) paid to the\r\nYazoo claimants, under the same compact, $4,282,151.12, making in the\r\naggregate $7,735,243.52, which sum did not include any portion of the\r\nexpense of the Creek war, whereby upwards of 7,000,000 acres were\r\nacquired for the State of Georgia.[295]\r\n\r\nThe President expressed it as his opinion that the Indian title was\r\nnot in the slightest degree affected by the compact with Georgia, and\r\nthat there was no obligation resting on the United States to remove the\r\nIndians by force, in the face of the stipulation that it should be done\r\n_peaceably_ and on _reasonable_ conditions. The compact gave a claim to\r\nthe State which ought to be executed in all its conditions with good\r\nfaith. In doing this, however, it was the duty of the United States to\r\nregard its strict import, and to make no sacrifice of their interest\r\nnot called for by the compact, nor to commit any breach of right or\r\nhumanity toward the Indians repugnant to the judgment and revolting\r\nto the feelings of the whole American people. The Cherokee agent,\r\nEx-Governor McMinn, was shortly afterward ordered,[296] \"without delay\r\nand in the most effectual manner, forthwith to expel white intruders\r\nfrom Cherokee lands.\"\r\n\r\n_Alarm of the Cherokees and indignation of Georgia._--The views\r\nexpressed by the governor and legislature of Georgia upon this subject\r\nwere the cause of much alarm among the Cherokees, who, through their\r\ndelegation, appealed[297] to the magnanimity of the American Congress\r\nfor justice and for the protection of the rights, liberties, and lives\r\nof the Cherokee people. On the other hand, the doctrines enunciated in\r\nPresident Monroe's special message, quoted above, again aroused the\r\nindignation of the governor of Georgia, who, in a communication[298] to\r\nthe President, commented with much severity upon the bad faith that for\r\ntwenty years had characterized the conduct of the executive officers of\r\nthe United States in their treatment of the matter in dispute.\r\n\r\n_Message of President John Quincy Adams._--Every day but added\r\nacrimonious intensity to the feelings of the officials and people of\r\nGeorgia. Their determination to at once possess both the Creek and the\r\nCherokee territory within her chartered limits would admit of no delay\r\nor compromise. Following the Creek treaty of 1826, her surveyors were\r\npromptly and forcibly introduced into the ceded country, in spite of an\r\nexpress provision of the treaty forbidding such action prior to the 1st\r\nof January, 1827. So critical was the state of affairs considered to be\r\nthat President John Quincy Adams invited the attention of Congress to\r\nthe subject in a special message.[299] Therein the President declared\r\nthat it ought not to be disguised that the act of the legislature of\r\nGeorgia, under the construction given to it by the governor of that\r\nState, and the surveys made or attempted by his authority beyond the\r\nboundary secured by the treaty of 1826 to the Creek Indians, were in\r\ndirect violation of the supreme law of the land, set forth in a treaty\r\nwhich had received all the sanctions provided by the Constitution;\r\nthat happily distributed as the sovereign powers of the people of this\r\nUnion had been between their general and State governments, their\r\nhistory had already too often presented collisions between these\r\ndivided authorities with regard to the extent of their respective\r\npowers. No other case had, however, happened in which the application\r\nof military force by the Government of the Union had been suggested\r\nfor the enforcement of a law the violation of which had within any\r\nsingle State been prescribed by a legislative act of that State. In\r\nthe present instance it was his duty to say that if the legislative\r\nand executive authorities of the State of Georgia should persevere in\r\nacts of encroachment upon the territories secured by a solemn treaty to\r\nthe Indians and the laws of the Union remained unaltered, a superadded\r\nobligation, even higher than that of human authority, would compel the\r\nExecutive of the United States to enforce the laws and fulfill the\r\nduties of the nation by all the force committed for that purpose to his\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEE PROGRESS IN CIVILIZATION.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the many difficulties that had beset their paths and\r\nthe condition of uncertainty and suspense which had surrounded their\r\naffairs for years, the Cherokees seem to have continued steadily in\r\ntheir progress toward civilization.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. David Brown, who in the fall of 1825 made an extended tour\r\nof observation through their nation, submitted, in December[300] of\r\nthat year, for the information of the War Department, an extended\r\nand detailed report of his examination, from which it appeared that\r\nnumberless herds of cattle grazed upon their extensive plains; horses\r\nwere numerous; many and extensive flocks of sheep, goats, and swine\r\ncovered the hills and valleys; the climate was delicious and healthy\r\nand the winters were mild; the soil of the valleys and plains was rich,\r\nand was utilized in the production of corn, tobacco, cotton, wheat,\r\noats, indigo, and potatoes; considerable trade was carried on with the\r\nneighboring States, much cotton being exported in boats of their own to\r\nNew Orleans; apple and peach orchards were quite common; much attention\r\nwas paid to the cultivation of gardens; butter and cheese of their own\r\nmanufacture were seen upon many of their tables; public roads were\r\nnumerous in the nation and supplied at convenient distances with houses\r\nof entertainment kept by the natives; many and flourishing villages\r\ndotted the country; cotton and woolen cloths were manufactured by the\r\nwomen and home-made blankets were very common; almost every family grew\r\nsufficient cotton for its own consumption; industry and commercial\r\nenterprise were extending themselves throughout the nation; nearly\r\nall the merchants were native Cherokees; the population was rapidly\r\nincreasing, a census just taken showing 13,563 native citizens, 147\r\nwhite men and 73 white women who had intermarried with the Cherokees,\r\nand 1,277 slaves; schools were increasing every year, and indolence\r\nwas strongly discountenanced; the nation had no debt, and the revenue\r\nwas in a flourishing condition; a printing press was soon to be\r\nestablished, and a national library and museum were in contemplation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF NEGOTIATIONS FOR FURTHER CESSION OF LANDS.\r\n\r\nOn the 2d of March, 1827,[301] Congress passed an act authorizing\r\nthe President to open negotiations with the Cherokees for the\r\nextinguishment of their title to such lands as were claimed by them\r\nwithin the limits of the State of North Carolina, and also for such\r\nquantity of land as should be necessary in the building of a canal to\r\nconnect the Hiwassee and Canasauga Rivers.\r\n\r\nTen thousand dollars were appropriated to defray the expenses of such\r\nnegotiations, and Generals John Cocke, G. L. Davidson, and Alexander\r\nGrey were[302] appointed commissioners to conduct the same. Their\r\nnegotiations were barren of results, as were also those of Maj. F. W.\r\nArmstrong, who in the following year[303] was dispatched on a similar\r\nmission.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEROKEE NATION ADOPTS A CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\nAt a general convention, of delegates, \"duly authorized for that\r\npurpose,\" held at New Echota, in the Cherokee Nation, July 26, 1827, a\r\nconstitution, was adopted for the nation, predicated upon their assumed\r\nsovereignty and independence as one of the distinct nations of the\r\nearth. Such an instrument could not fail of exciting to the highest\r\npitch the feelings and animosity of the authorities and people of\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\n_Georgia's opinion of the Indian title._--Governor Forsyth\r\ninclosed[304] a copy of the \"presumptuous\" document to the President,\r\nat the same time desiring to know what the United States proposed to\r\ndo about the \"erection of a separate government within the limits of a\r\nsovereign State.\"\r\n\r\nHe also inclosed the report of a committee and the resolutions of the\r\nlegislature of Georgia predicated thereon as exhibiting the sentiments\r\nof that body on the subject. This committee, in reporting to the\r\nlegislature the results of their investigations, assert that anterior\r\nto the Revolutionary war the Cherokee lands in Georgia belonged to\r\nGreat Britain, and that the right as to both domain and empire was\r\ncomplete and perfect in that nation. The possession by the Indians was\r\npermissive. They were under the protection of Great Britain. Their\r\ntitle was temporary, being mere tenants at will, and such tenancy might\r\nhave been determined at any moment either by force or by negotiation,\r\nat the pleasure of that power. Upon the close of the Revolution,\r\nGeorgia assumed all the rights and powers in relation to the lands\r\nand Indians in question previously belonging to Great Britain, and\r\nhad not since divested herself of any right or power in relation to\r\nsuch lands, further than she had in respect of all the balance of\r\nher territory. She was now at full liberty and had the power and the\r\nright to possess herself, by any means she might choose, of the lands\r\nin dispute, and to extend over them her authority and laws. Although\r\npossessing this right, she was averse to exercising it until all other\r\nmeans of redress had failed. She now made one other and last appeal\r\nto the General Government to open negotiations with the Cherokees on\r\nthis subject. If no such negotiation should be opened, or if, being\r\nopened, it should result unsuccessfully, it was recommended to the next\r\nlegislature of Georgia to take immediate possession of the disputed\r\nterritory and to extend her jurisdiction and laws over the same. In a\r\nspirit of liberality, however, it was suggested that, in any treaty the\r\nUnited States might make with the Cherokees, Georgia would agree to\r\nallow reserves to be made to individual Indians not exceeding in the\r\naggregate one-sixth part of the entire territory in dispute. Should the\r\nIndians still refuse to negotiate, they were solemnly warned of the\r\nunfortunate consequences likely to follow, as the lands _belonged_ to\r\nGeorgia, and that she _must_ and _would_ have them.\r\n\r\nA resolution of the House of Representatives of the United States,\r\nin the month of March following, calling upon the President for\r\ninformation upon the subject, brought forth[305] copies of all the\r\ncorrespondence relative to the matter, and the distinct avowal that\r\nthe records of the United States failed to show any act of executive\r\nrecognition of the new form of Cherokee government, but that, on the\r\ncontrary, their status toward the United States was regarded as not in\r\nthe slightest degree changed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEE AFFAIRS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nWhilst all these events having a bearing upon the condition and\r\nprospective welfare of that portion of the Cherokee people who had\r\nremained in their old homes east of the Mississippi River were\r\nhappening, those who had taken up their abode in the Arkansas country\r\nwere likewise having their troubles.\r\n\r\n_Difficulties with the Osages._--Their disagreements with the Osages,\r\nwhich had, with slight intermission, existed for years, broke out\r\nafresh when in February, 1820, a party of Osages robbed and killed\r\nthree Cherokees. The latter determined upon the prosecution of a\r\ngeneral war against the aggressors, and were only persuaded to pause\r\nat the earnest solicitation[306] of Governor Miller, of Arkansas\r\nTerritory, until he could visit the villages of the Osages and demand\r\nthe surrender of the murderers. In company with four of the Cherokee\r\nchiefs, he proceeded to the principal Osage village, where they were\r\nkindly received by the Osages, who repudiated the action of the\r\nmurderers and agreed conditionally to surrender them. They, however,\r\nproduced the treaty concluded in 1818, under the superintendence\r\nof Governor Clark, between themselves and the Cherokees, Shawnees,\r\nand Delawares, wherein it was agreed that a permanent peace should\r\nthenceforth exist between them, and that the Cherokees were to meet\r\nthem at Fort Smith the following spring and surrender all Osage\r\nprisoners, which the former had neglected to do and still retained a\r\nnumber of Osage captives. The Cherokee chiefs admitted that this was\r\ntrue, whereupon Governor Miller advised them that before the Osage\r\nmurderers could be surrendered, the Cherokees must comply with their\r\nagreement by surrendering all prisoners in their hands. An arrangement\r\nwas made to meet at Fort Smith in October following and effect the\r\nexchange,[307] which was done. Notwithstanding this adjustment, the\r\nfeeling of hostility between the two tribes remained. Active warfare\r\nbroke out again in the summer of 1821,[308] and was not suppressed by\r\nthe most strenuous efforts of the United States authorities until the\r\nfall of the following year.[309]\r\n\r\n_Boundaries and area._--Governor Miller reported, in connection with\r\nthis subject, that the Arkansas Cherokees were very restless and\r\ndissatisfied. They complained much in that, as they said, no part of\r\nthe treaty of 1819 had been complied with by the United States and in\r\nthat they had received no annuity money since their removal to the west\r\nof the Mississippi River. Furthermore, their boundaries had not been\r\nestablished, and they still awaited the fulfillment of the promise made\r\nthem for an extension of their line to the west as far as the Osage\r\nline. To this latter scheme the Osages were much opposed, preferring\r\nrather to have the country occupied by whites. The adjustment of this\r\nboundary question would seem to have been very desirable, inasmuch as\r\nnearly one-half of the Cherokees had taken up their abode south of\r\nthe Arkansas River,[310] which was clearly outside of their proper\r\nlimits. It formed the subject of much correspondence and complaint\r\nthroughout several years, and was the occasion of a number of visits of\r\nrepresentative delegations from the Arkansas Cherokees to Washington.\r\nThe eastern boundary had, as already stated, been run by General Rector\r\nin 1818-'19, but the difficulty in fixing the western line arose\r\nfrom the fact that the quantity of land to which the Cherokees were\r\nentitled was to be measured by the area already ceded by them to the\r\nUnited States by the treaties of 1817 and 1819. The ascertainment of\r\nthis latter quantity with exactness could not be made in advance of\r\nthe completion of the surveys thereof by the States of North Carolina,\r\nTennessee, and Georgia. From such reports and estimates as the United\r\nStates were able to secure from the several State authorities, it\r\nwas estimated, early in 1823,[311] that the quantity to which the\r\nCherokees were entitled was about 3,285,710 acres, and they were\r\ninformed that measures would at once be taken to have the western\r\nboundary established. This was performed under direction of Governor\r\nMiller, in compliance with instructions given him for that purpose on\r\nthe 4th of March, 1823. A year later[312] a delegation of the Indians\r\nvisited Washington to complain that the boundary had been run without\r\nnotice to them and in such a manner as to be highly prejudicial to\r\ntheir interests. It was also urged that the quantity of land included\r\nwas largely less than the quantity ceded by the Cherokees east of the\r\nMississippi.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that in the survey of this western boundary Governor\r\nMiller, through a misconception of his instructions, had caused the\r\nline to be run due north, and south, instead of in a direction parallel\r\nwith that of the east line, as was the evident intention of the treaty\r\nof 1817.[313] The effect of this action was to largely curtail the\r\nCherokee frontage on Arkansas River, where the lands were rich and\r\ncapable of remunerative cultivation, and to extend their frontier on\r\nthe Upper White River, toward the rough and comparatively valueless\r\nregion of the Ozark Mountains. It was also admitted by the Secretary of\r\nWar that the quantity of land within these boundaries was probably less\r\nthan that to which the Cherokees were entitled.[314] Inquiries were\r\naccordingly again made of the several State authorities as to the area\r\nof territory acquired by them through the treaties of 1817 and 1819,\r\nthe replies to which, though partially estimated, aggregated 4,282,216\r\nacres.[315] Directions were therefore given to Agent Duval[316] to\r\npropose to the Indians the running of a provisional line, subject to\r\nsuch future alterations as the official returns of the quantity ceded\r\nin the States should render necessary and proper. It seems, however,\r\nfrom a report of Agent Duval, that the Cherokees in council had\r\nexpressed to him a preference to adopt for their western boundary what\r\nwas known as the \"upper\" or Governor Miller line, and to run thence\r\ndown and between the Arkansas and White Rivers for quantity, ignoring\r\nthe line run under the treaty of 1817 by General Rector, the effect\r\nof which would be to give them an extension of territory to the east\r\ninstead of toward the west. This proposition called forth directions\r\nfrom the Secretary of War to Governor Izard, in the spring of 1825, to\r\nopen negotiations with the Cherokees upon the subject of an exchange\r\nof territory with them for an equal quantity of land lying to the west\r\nof Arkansas and Missouri, and for their removal thereto, but that the\r\nmatter must not be pressed to the point of irritation. If, through the\r\naversion of the Indians to entertain such a proposition, it should be\r\ndropped, then, if ±he same should be satisfactory to the citizens of\r\nArkansas, the proposal contained in the report of Agent Duval would\r\nmeet the views of the Government.[317]\r\n\r\nThe Indians were brought to no definite agreement to either of these\r\npropositions. In the meantime their provisional western boundary was\r\nestablished and run, in January and February, 1825.[318] The line began\r\nat the upper end of Table Rock Bluff, on the Arkansas River, and ran\r\nnorth 1 mile and 70 chains, crossing Skin Bayou at a distance of 66\r\nchains from the beginning; thence it ran north 53° east 132 miles and\r\n31 chains, to White River, which it struck at a point opposite the\r\nmouth of Little North Fork.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, so strong was the prejudice of the Cherokees\r\nagainst any concession of territory that their council passed[319] what\r\nthey denominated a \"perpetual law\" denouncing the death penalty against\r\nany of their nation who should propose the sale or exchange of their\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n_Lovely's purchase._--In the mean time the legislature of Arkansas,\r\nthrough Acting Governor Crittenden, had forwarded to the President\r\nin the summer of 1824, a memorial urging that the tract of country\r\nknown as \"Lovely's purchase\" be thrown open to white settlement by a\r\nrevocation of the prohibitory order of December 15, 1818. This the\r\nPresident declined to do until a final adjustment should be made of the\r\nwest boundary of the Cherokees and the east boundary of the Choctaws.\r\nA history of \"Lovely's purchase\" is to be found in a letter dated\r\nJanuary 30, 1818, from Major Long, of the Topographical Engineers,\r\nto General Thomas A. Smith. From this it seems that by a treaty then\r\nrecently made (but without any authority) with the Osages, \"by Mr.\r\nLovely, late Indian agent,\"[320] that tribe had ceded to the United\r\nStates the country between the Arkansas and Red Rivers, and also a\r\ntract on the north of the Arkansas situated between the Verdigris River\r\nand the boundary established by the Osage treaty of 1808. It appears,\r\nhowever, that it was not the intention of the Osages to cede to the\r\nUnited States so large a tract on the north of the Arkansas, but, as\r\nafterwards alleged by their chiefs, they only desired to surrender\r\nthe country lying south of a line commencing at the Falls of the\r\nVerdigris and running due east to the treaty line of 1808, and east of\r\nanother line beginning at the same place and running due south as far\r\nas their possessions should extend, and thence east again to the 1808\r\nboundary, excepting and reserving therefrom the point of land between\r\nthe Verdigris and Six Bulls or Grand River. The Osages, never having\r\nbeen informed that the treaty was not duly authorized and had not been\r\nconfirmed, still considered the country described therein as belonging\r\nto the United States, and had repeatedly solicited whites to settle\r\non it, alleging that the main object of the cession on their part was\r\nto secure the convenient approach of civilized neighbors, who should\r\ninstruct the men how to cultivate the ground and the women to spin and\r\nweave, that they might be able to live when the forests should afford\r\nno further supplies of game. They were therefore much irritated when\r\nthey found civilized settlements prohibited, in order to protect the\r\nintroduction and establishment adjoining or upon this territory of\r\ntheir inveterate enemies, the Cherokees.\r\n\r\n_Western outlet._--The indefinite outlet to the west which had been\r\npromised the Cherokees by the President in 1818 formed the subject of\r\nmuch complaint by them from time to time. In the spring of 1823[321]\r\nthey were advised that until their western boundary was established\r\nit would be improper to make any decision upon the \"outlet\" question.\r\nTwo years earlier[322] it had been declared to them that in removing\r\nsettlers from \"Lovely's Purchase,\" for the purpose of giving them their\r\nwestern outlet, it must always be understood that they thereby acquired\r\nno right to the soil, and that the Government reserved to itself the\r\nright of making such disposition as it might think proper of all salt\r\nsprings therein. But this troublous question was definitively disposed\r\nof when the treaty of 1828 came to be negotiated.\r\n\r\nBy the provisions of an act of Congress approved April 5, 1826,[323]\r\nthe land districts of the Territory of Arkansas were extended so as to\r\ninclude all the country within the limits of that Territory as then\r\nexisting (the limits having been extended 40 miles to the west by act\r\nof Congress of May 26, 1824),[324] with the proviso, however, that\r\nnothing in the act should be so construed as to authorize any survey\r\nor interference whatever upon any lands the right whereof resided\r\nin any Indian tribes. Notwithstanding this proviso, reports became\r\ncurrent that surveys had been begun of \"Lovely's Purchase,\" causing\r\nmuch irritation and ill feeling among the Cherokees and eliciting an\r\norder[325] from the Secretary of War forbidding any further surveys\r\nuntil it should be finally ascertained how much land the Cherokees\r\nwere entitled to receive from the United States in pursuance of the\r\ntreaties of 1817 and 1819.\r\n\r\n_Negotiation and conclusion of treaty of 1828._--Matters remained thus\r\n_in statu quo_ until the spring of 1828, when a delegation of the\r\nWestern Cherokees arrived in Washington, clothed with authority to\r\npresent to the attention of the President their numerous grievances and\r\nto adjust all matters in dispute for their people. The burden of their\r\ncomplaints had relation to the delays that had occurred in fixing their\r\nboundaries; to the failure to secure to them the promised \"western\r\noutlet;\" to the adjustment of the hostilities that continued to exist\r\nbetween themselves and the Osages; and to the irregularity in the\r\nreceipt of their annuities, as well as to the encroachments of white\r\nsettlers.[326]\r\n\r\nThe delegation were not clothed with authority to negotiate for\r\nany cession or exchange of territory, the \"perpetual law\" against\r\nentertaining such a proposition being still in force among them.\r\nNotwithstanding this fact, a communication was addressed to them\r\nfrom the War Department[327] desiring to be advised if they had any\r\nobjection to opening negotiations upon a basis of an exchange of land\r\nfor territory west of the west boundary of Arkansas, provided that\r\nboundary should be removed a distance of 40 miles to the east, so as to\r\nrun from Fort Smith to the southwest corner of the State of Missouri,\r\nand also that the Creeks should be removed from their location above\r\nthe Falls of Verdigris River to territory within the forks of the\r\nCanadian and Arkansas Rivers. To this proposal the delegation returned\r\na polite but determined refusal, and demanded that the actual number of\r\nacres to which they were entitled in Arkansas be ascertained and laid\r\noff with exact definiteness. The whole subject of an exchange of lands\r\nwas thereupon submitted by the Secretary of War to the President for\r\nhis direction, and it was announced[328] to the visiting delegation\r\nthat the President had concluded to order a permanent western line\r\nto be run, within which should be embraced the full quantity of land\r\nto which they were entitled, and which was found to be, as nearly as\r\npossible, as follows:[329]\r\n\r\n                                                                 Acres\r\n\r\n  In lieu of quantity ceded in Georgia(actual survey)           824,384\r\n\r\n  In lieu of quantity ceded in Alabama(actual survey)           738,560\r\n\r\n  In lieu of quantity ceded in Tennessee (actual survey)      1,024,000\r\n\r\n  In lieu of quantity ceded in North Carolina\r\n      (survey 70,000, estimate 630,000)                         700,000\r\n\r\n                                                               ________\r\n\r\n                                                              3,286,944\r\n\r\n  Less 12 miles square, school reservation in Alabama            92,160\r\n                                                               ________\r\n\r\n                                                              3,194,784\r\n\r\nAs to their promised \"western outlet,\" the President was unprepared to\r\nsay anything definite, inasmuch as that matter was then in the hands of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nFrom this showing it was made evident to the delegation, and no\r\nopportunity was lost to impress the fact strongly upon them, that\r\nif they insisted upon refusing to arrange for an exchange of lands,\r\ninstead of being entitled to a large additional tract beyond their\r\nprovisional western boundary, they would, in fact, be entitled to\r\nseveral hundred thousand acres less than had already been placed in\r\ntheir possession. In addition to this it was more than doubtful,\r\nfrom the temper of the President and Congress, whether their long\r\nanticipated \"western outlet\" would ever crystallize into anything more\r\ntangible than a promise. With these facts staring them in the face,\r\nwith the alluring offers held out to them of double the quantity of\r\nland possessed by them in Arkansas in exchange, with liberal promises\r\nof assistance in their proposed new homes, and with the persistent\r\nimportunities of their agent and other United States officials, they\r\nyielded, and the treaty of May 6, 1828,[330] an abstract of which\r\nhas been already given, was the result. It was promptly ratified and\r\nproclaimed on the 28th of the same month.\r\n\r\nSo nervous were the members of the delegation, after the treaty had\r\nbeen concluded and signed, as to the reception that would greet them\r\non their return home, that the Secretary of War felt the necessity of\r\ngiving them a letter of explanation to their people. In this letter the\r\nCherokees were advised of the integrity, good conduct, and earnest zeal\r\nfor the welfare of their nation that had invariably characterized the\r\nactions of their delegation at Washington. The nation was assured that\r\ntheir representatives had done the best thing possible for them to do\r\nin the late treaty.[331]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this testimonial, the delegation met with an angry\r\nreception on their return home. Their lives and property were unsafe;\r\nthe national council pronounced them guilty of fraud and deception,\r\ndeclared the treaty to be null and void, as having been made without\r\nany authority, and expressed an earnest desire to send a delegation to\r\nWashington clothed with power to arrange all differences.[332]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Agent Duval had been advised[333] of the ratification\r\nof the treaty, and Messrs. R. Ellis and A. Finney had been appointed,\r\nin conjunction with him, as commissioners to value all improvements and\r\nproperty abandoned by the Cherokees, and to sell the agency property as\r\na means of raising funds for the erection of mills in their new country.\r\n\r\n_Survey of new boundaries._--The eastern line of this new Cherokee\r\ncountry, dividing it from Arkansas, was surveyed in 1829,[334] but it\r\nwas not until April 13, 1831, that instructions were given to Isaac\r\nMcCoy to survey the remaining boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe fourth article of the treaty of 1828 contained a provision\r\nrequiring the United States to sell the property and improvements\r\nconnected with the agency for the erection of a grist and saw mill for\r\nthe use of the Indians in their new home. In lieu of this grist and saw\r\nmill the United States furnished them with patent corn-mills to the\r\namount of the appraised value of the improvements. A tract in townships\r\n7 and 8 of range 21, including these agency improvements, was surveyed\r\nseparately in 1829, and was commonly known as the \"Cherokee Agency\r\nReservation.\" In after years the Cherokees claimed that they had never\r\nbeen compensated for this so-called reserve and asserted that it still\r\nbelonged to them. After a dispute continuing through many years, it\r\nwas finally decided by the Secretary of the Interior, on the 28th of\r\nJune, 1878, that the reserve did not belong to the Cherokees, but that,\r\nthrough the operation of the treaty with them, it became a part of the\r\npublic domain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 269: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 311.]\r\nwithout delay, and to remove all white settlers and other objectionable\r\npeople living to the west of the east boundary of the Cherokee tract.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 270: Meigs was appointed, May 15, 1801, superintendent of\r\nIndian affairs for the Cherokee Nation and agent for the War Department\r\nin the State of Tennessee.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 271: Letter of Meigs to General Wilkinson, dated Marietta,\r\nOhio, February 10, 1801. This letter is in reply to one received from\r\nGeneral Wilkinson, in which the latter, among other things, inquires if\r\nhe can in any way serve the former. Meigs replies: \"I will answer these\r\nkind inquiries truly. In the first place, I enjoy excellent health; in\r\nthe next place, I am doing what I can at farming business, endeavoring\r\nto maintain a credible existence by industry. I have been for more than\r\ntwo years one of the Territorial legislators; this, though credible,\r\nis not profitable. My principal dependence for living is on the labor\r\nof my own hands. I am confident, sir, you _can serve_ me, as you are\r\nconversant with every department of the Government and may know what\r\nplaces can be had and whether I am capable of being usefully employed.\r\nI don't care what it is, whether civil or military or where situated,\r\nprovided it be an object which you shall think proper for me. I don't\r\nknow Mr. Jefferson; have always revered his character as a great and\r\ngood man. I am personally acquainted with Colonel Burr. He ascended\r\nthe river Kennebeck as a volunteer in the year 1775 and was with me\r\nin the Mess a great part of that march to Canada. I think I have his\r\nfriendship, but he is not yet, perhaps, in a situation to assist me.\"\r\nColonel Meigs was also a member of the court-martial convened for the\r\ntrial of General Arthur St. Clair for the evacuation of Ticonderoga. He\r\ndied at his post of duty in February, 1823, as shown by a letter to the\r\nSecretary of War from ex-Governor McMinn, dated the 22d of that month.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 272: May 30, 1820.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 273: Letter of Secretary of War to Attorney-General, July,\r\n26, 1820.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 274: August 12, 1820.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 275: August 14, 1820.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 276: March 7, 1821.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 277: American State Papers, Public Lands, Vol. I, p. 125.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 278: January 7, 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 279: June 15, 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 280: August 24, 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 281: November 19, 1822.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 282: March 17, 1823.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 283: February, 1823.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 284: March 17, 1823.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 285: Report of commissioners on file in Office Indian\r\nAffairs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 286: See correspondence between commissioners and Cherokee\r\ncouncil.

Ellsworth, and John F. Schermerhorn, commissioners\r\n    on the part of the United States, and the chiefs and headmen of the\r\n    Cherokee Nation of Indians west of the Mississippi._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nIt having been ascertained that the territory assigned to the\r\nCherokees by the treaty of May 6, 1828, conflicted with a portion\r\nof the territory selected by the Creek Nation in conformity with\r\nthe provisions of the Creek treaty of January 24, 1826, and the\r\nrepresentative men of those two nations having met each other in\r\ncouncil and adjusted all disputes as to boundaries, the United States,\r\nin order to confirm this adjustment, concluded the following articles\r\nof treaty and agreement with the Cherokees:\r\n\r\n1. The United States agree to possess the Cherokees, and to guarantee\r\nit to them forever, * * * of seven millions of acres of land, to be\r\nbounded as follows, viz: Beginning at a point on the old western\r\nTerritorial line of Arkansas Territory, being twenty-five miles north\r\nfrom the point where the Territorial line crosses Arkansas River;\r\nthence running from said north point south on the said Territorial line\r\nto the place where said Territorial line crosses the Verdigris River;\r\nthence down said Verdigris River to the Arkansas River; thence down\r\nsaid Arkansas River to a point where a stone is placed opposite to the\r\neast or lower bank of Grand River at its junction with the Arkansas;\r\nthence running south forty-four degrees west one mile; thence in a\r\nstraight line to a point four miles northerly from the mouth of the\r\nNorth Fork of the Canadian; thence along the said four miles line to\r\nthe Canadian; thence down the Canadian to the Arkansas; thence down\r\nthe Arkansas to that point on the Arkansas where the eastern Choctaw\r\nboundary strikes said river, and running thence with the western line\r\nof Arkansas Territory, as now defined, to the southwest corner of\r\nMissouri; thence along the western Missouri line to the land assigned\r\nto the Senecas; thence on the south line of the Senecas to Grand River;\r\nthence up said Grand River as far as the south line of the Osage\r\nReservation, extended if necessary; thence up and between said south\r\nOsage line, extended west if necessary, and a line drawn due west from\r\nthe point of beginning, to a certain distance west at which a line\r\nrunning north and south from said Osage line to said due-west line will\r\nmake seven millions of acres within the whole described boundaries.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the seven millions of acres of land thus provided for\r\nand bounded, the United States further guarantee to the Cherokee Nation\r\na perpetual outlet west, and a free and unmolested use of all the\r\ncountry lying west of the western boundary of said seven millions of\r\nacres, as far as the sovereignty of the United States and their right\r\nof soil extend: _Provided, however_, That if the saline or salt plain\r\non the great western prairie shall fall within said limits prescribed\r\nfor said outlet, the right is reserved to the United States to permit\r\nother tribes of red men to get salt on said plain in common with the\r\nCherokees. And letters patent shall be issued by the United States as\r\nsoon as practicable for the land hereby guaranteed.\r\n\r\n2. The Cherokees relinquish to the United States all claim to all land\r\nceded or claimed to have been ceded to them by treaty of May 6, 1828,\r\nnot embraced within the limits fixed in this present supplementary\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\n3. The United States agree to cancel, at the request of the Cherokees,\r\nthe sixth article of the treaty of May 6, 1828.\r\n\r\n4. The United States agree to furnish the Cherokees, during the\r\npleasure of the President, four blacksmith's shops, one wagon-maker's\r\nshop, one wheelwright's shop, and necessary tools, implements, and\r\nmaterial for the same; also four blacksmiths, one wagon-maker, and one\r\nwheelwright; also eight patent railway corn-mills, in lieu of those\r\nagreed to be furnished by article 4 of the treaty of May 6, 1828.\r\n\r\n5. These articles are supplementary to the treaty of May 6, 1828.\r\n\r\n6. One mile square to be set apart for the accommodation of the\r\nCherokee Agency, to be selected jointly by the Cherokee Nation and\r\nUnited States agent.\r\n\r\n7. This treaty to be obligatory after ratification by the President and\r\nSenate.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\nCONFLICTING LAND CLAIMS OF CREEKS AND CHEROKEES WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of January 24, 1826,[336] with the Creek Indians had\r\nprovided for the removal of that tribe west of the Mississippi. In\r\naccordance with its provisions, a delegation consisting of five\r\nrepresentative men of the tribe proceeded to the western country and\r\nselected the territory designed for their future occupancy. The year\r\nfollowing this selection a party of Creeks removed to and settled\r\nthereon. The country thus selected and occupied lay along and between\r\nthe Verdigris, Arkansas, and Canadian Rivers.[337]\r\n\r\nSubsequently, on the 6th day of May, 1828,[338] a treaty was concluded\r\nwith the Cherokee Nation west of the Mississippi, by the terms of which\r\nthey ceded all their lands within the present limits of Arkansas and\r\naccepted a tract of 7,000,000 acres within the present limits of Indian\r\nTerritory, in addition to a perpetual outlet extending as far west as\r\nthe western limits of the United States at that time, being the one\r\nhundredth meridian of longitude west from Greenwich.\r\n\r\nThis new assignment of territory to the Cherokees, it was soon found,\r\nincluded a considerable portion of the lands selected by and already in\r\nthe possession of the Creeks.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of this fact produced much excitement and ill feeling\r\nin the minds of the people of both tribes, and led to many acts of\r\ninjustice and violence during the course of several years.\r\n\r\n_Territorial difficulties adjusted._--In the year 1832 a commission\r\nwas constituted, consisting of Montfort Stokes, Henry L. Ellsworth,\r\nand John F. Schermerhorn, with instructions to visit the country west\r\nof the Mississippi and to report fully all information relating to\r\nthe country assigned as a permanent home to the aborigines. Among the\r\nformidable difficulties presented for and earnestly urged upon their\r\nattention and consideration were these conflicting territorial claims\r\nof the Creeks and the Cherokees. Both parties claimed several million\r\nacres of the same land under treaty stipulations; both were equally\r\npersuaded of the justice of their respective claims, and at first were\r\nunyielding in their dispositions.\r\n\r\nAfter a protracted public council, however, in which a careful\r\nexamination and exposition of the various treaties was made, the\r\ncommissioners succeeded in inducing the Creeks to accept other lands\r\nto the southward of their upper settlements on Verdigris River,[339]\r\nand concluded treaties with both the Creeks and the Cherokees modifying\r\ntheir respective boundaries.\r\n\r\nThis treaty of February 14, 1833, with the latter tribe occasioned a\r\nmaterial change in the boundaries previously assigned them.\r\n\r\nInstead of following the western line of Arkansas and Missouri as far\r\nnorth as the point where the Grand or Neosho River crosses the boundary\r\nof the latter State, and running from thence due west to a point due\r\nnorth of the old western boundary line of Arkansas Territory, and\r\nthence south to the Arkansas River, the new line followed the present\r\nwestern boundary of Arkansas and Missouri as far north as the south\r\nline of the territory then recently assigned to the Senecas; thence\r\nwest along the south line of the Senecas to Grand River, and following\r\nup Grand River to the south boundary of the Osage reservation, which\r\nwas parallel with the present southern boundary of Kansas, and on the\r\naverage about two miles to the north of it; thence west for quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURCHASE OF OSAGE HALF-BREED RESERVES.\r\n\r\nPrior[340] to the conclusion of this treaty of 1833, a delegation of\r\nthe Western Cherokees had visited Washington to insist upon a literal\r\nfulfillment of the treaty of 1828 and especially to demand that they\r\nbe possessed of all lands and improvements within the outboundaries\r\nof their country as defined by the last named treaty. The lands and\r\nimprovements alluded to were seven reservations of one section each on\r\nthe Neosho River assigned to certain half-breed Osage Indians by the\r\nterms of the treaty of 1825[341] with that tribe.\r\n\r\nAlthough the treaty of 1833 failed to make provision for the\r\nextinguishment of these Osage half-breed titles, the desired object was\r\nattained by the terms of the fourth article of the treaty of December\r\n29, 1835, wherein $15,000 were appropriated for the purchase.[342]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT JACKSON REFUSES TO APPROVE THE TREATY OF 1834.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of February, 1834, George Vashon, agent for the Western\r\nCherokees, negotiated a treaty with them[343] having in view an\r\nadjustment of certain differences between themselves and their eastern\r\nbrethren, whereby the feelings of the latter should be more favorably\r\naffected toward an emigration to the western country. The treaty\r\nprovided for a readjustment of the tribal annuities proportioned to\r\nthe respective numbers of the Cherokees east and west, the basis\r\nof division to be ascertained by an accurate census. The country\r\nprovided for the Cherokees by the treaty of 1833 was to be enlarged\r\nso that it should equal in quantity, acre for acre, the country ceded\r\nby the Cherokees east in 1817 and 1819, as well as the proportional\r\nquantity of those who should agree to emigrate to the West under the\r\nprovisions of this treaty. It was also agreed that all Cherokees should\r\npossess equal rights in the new country, and that an asylum should be\r\nestablished for the maintenance of the orphan children of the tribe.\r\nThe negotiations thus entered into were, however, barren of results,\r\ninasmuch as President Jackson refused to recommend the treaty to the\r\nSenate for the advice and consent of that body.[344]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 335: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 414.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 336: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 286.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 337: See Creek treaty of 1833, United States Statutes at\r\nLarge, Vol. VII, p. 417.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 338: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 311.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 339: See preamble to Creek treaty of February 14, 1833,\r\nUnited States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 417.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 340: In March, 1832.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 341: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 240.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 342: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 478.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 343: See Indian Office files.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 344: See Indian Office records.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY CONCLUDED DECEMBER 29, 1835; PROCLAIMED MAY 23, 1836.\r\n\r\n    _Held at New Echota, Georgia, between General William Carroll\r\n    and John F. Schermerhorn, commissioners on the part of the United\r\n    States, and the chiefs, headmen, and people of the Cherokee tribe\r\n    of Indians.[345]_\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nThe preamble recites at considerable length the reasons for the\r\nnegotiation of the treaty and the preliminary steps taken, following\r\nwhich the provisions of the treaty as concluded are given.\r\n\r\n1. The Cherokee Nation cedes to the United States all the land claimed\r\nby said Nation east of the Mississippi River, and hereby releases all\r\nclaims on the United States for spoliations of every kind for and in\r\nconsideration of $5,000,000. In case the United States Senate should\r\ndecide that this sum does not include spoliation claims, then $300,000\r\nadditional should be allowed for that purpose.\r\n\r\n2. The description of the 7,000,000 acres of land guaranteed to the\r\nCherokees west of the Mississippi by the treaties of 1828 and 1833 is\r\nrepeated, and in addition thereto the further guaranty is made to the\r\nCherokee Nation of a perpetual outlet west, and a free and unmolested\r\nuse of all the country west of the western boundary of said 7,000,000\r\nacres, as far west as the sovereignty of the United States and their\r\nright of soil extend, provided that if the salt plain shall fall within\r\nthe limits of said outlet the right is reserved to the United States to\r\npermit other tribes of Indians to procure salt thereon. \"And letters\r\npatent shall be issued by the United States as soon as practicable for\r\nthe land hereby guaranteed.\"\r\n\r\nIt being apprehended that the above would afford insufficient land for\r\nthe Cherokees, the United States, in consideration of $500,000, agree\r\nto patent to them in fee simple the following additional tract, viz:\r\nBeginning at the southeast corner of the Osage Reservation, and running\r\nnorth along the east line of the Osage lands 50 miles to the northeast\r\ncorner thereof, thence east to the west line of the State of Missouri,\r\nthence with said line south 50 miles, thence west to the place of\r\nbeginning, estimated to contain 800,000 acres, it being understood that\r\nif any of the Quapaw lands should fall within these limits they should\r\nbe excepted.\r\n\r\n3. All the foregoing described lands to be included in one patent,\r\nunder the provisions of the act of May 28, 1830; the United States\r\nto retain possession of the Fort Gibson military reservation until\r\nabandoned, when it shall revert to the Cherokees. The United States\r\nreserve the right to establish post and military roads and forts in any\r\npart of the Cherokee country.\r\n\r\n4. The United States agree to extinguish for the Cherokees the Osage\r\nhalf-breed titles to reservations under the treaty of 1825 for the\r\nsum of $15,000. The United States agree to pay to the American Board\r\nof Commissioners for Foreign Missions the appraised value of their\r\nimprovements at Union and Harmony missions.\r\n\r\n5. The United States agree that the land herein guaranteed to the\r\nCherokees shall never, without their consent, be included within the\r\nlimits or jurisdiction of any State or Territory. The United States\r\nalso agree to secure them the right to make and carry into effect such\r\nlaws as they deem necessary, provided they shall not be inconsistent\r\nwith the Constitution of the United States and such acts of Congress\r\nas provide for the regulation of trade and intercourse with the Indian\r\ntribes; and provided also they shall not affect such citizens and army\r\nof the United States as may travel or reside in the Indian country by\r\npermission granted under the laws or regulations thereof.\r\n\r\n6. Perpetual peace shall exist between the United States and the\r\nCherokees. The United States shall protect the Cherokees from domestic\r\nstrife, foreign enemies, and from war with other tribes, as well as\r\nfrom the unlawful intrusion of citizens of the United States. The\r\nCherokees shall endeavor to maintain peace among themselves and with\r\ntheir neighbors.\r\n\r\n7. The Cherokees shall be entitled to a delegate in the United States\r\nHouse of Representatives whenever Congress shall make provision for the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n8. The United States agree to remove the Cherokees to their new home\r\nand to provide them with one year's subsistence thereafter. Those\r\ndesiring to remove themselves shall be allowed a commutation of $20 per\r\nhead therefor, and, if they prefer it, a commutation of $33-1/3 per\r\nhead in lieu of the one year's promised subsistence. Cherokees residing\r\noutside the limits of the nation who shall remove within two years to\r\nthe new Cherokee country shall be entitled to the same allowances as\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n9. The United States agree to make an appraisement of the value of all\r\nCherokee improvements and ferries. The just debts of the Indians shall\r\nbe paid out of any moneys due them for improvements and claims. The\r\nIndians shall be furnished with sufficient funds for their removal, and\r\nthe balance of their dues shall be paid them at the Cherokee Agency\r\nwest of the Mississippi. Missionary establishments shall be appraised\r\nand the value paid to the treasurers of the societies by whom they were\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\n10. The President of the United States shall invest in good\r\ninterest-paying stocks the following sums for the benefit of the\r\nCherokee people, the interest thereon only to be expended: $200,000,\r\nin addition to their present annuities, for a general national fund;\r\n$50,000 for an orphans' fund; $150,000, in addition to existing school\r\nfund, for a permanent national school fund: the disbursement of the\r\ninterest on the foregoing funds to be subject to examination and any\r\nmisapplications thereof to be corrected by the President of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nOn two years' notice the Cherokee council may withdraw their funds,\r\nby the consent of the President and the United States Senate, and\r\ninvest them in such manner as they deem proper. The United States\r\nagree to appropriate $60,000 to pay the just debts and claims against\r\nthe Cherokee Nation held by citizens of the same, and also claims of\r\ncitizens of the United States for services rendered the nation. Three\r\nhundred thousand dollars is appropriated by the United States to\r\nliquidate Cherokee claims against the United States for spoliations of\r\nevery kind.\r\n\r\n11. The Cherokees agree to commute their existing permanent annuity\r\nof $10,000 for the sum of $214,000, the same to be invested by the\r\nPresident as a part of the general fund of the nation. Their present\r\nschool fund shall also constitute a portion of the permanent national\r\nschool fund.\r\n\r\n12. Such Cherokees as are averse to removal west of the Mississippi and\r\ndesire to become citizens of the States where they reside, if qualified\r\nto take care of themselves and their property, shall receive their\r\nproportion of all the personal benefits accruing under this treaty for\r\nclaims, improvements, and per capita.\r\n\r\nSuch heads of Cherokee families as desire to reside within the States\r\nof North Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama, subject to the laws\r\nthereof and qualified to become useful citizens, shall be entitled\r\nto a pre-emption right of 160 acres at the minimum Congress price,\r\nto include their improvements. John Ross and eleven others named are\r\ndesignated as a committee on the part of the Cherokees to recommend\r\npersons entitled to take pre-emption rights, to select the missionaries\r\nwho shall be removed with the nation, and to transact all business that\r\nmay arise with the United States in carrying the treaty into effect.\r\nOne hundred thousand dollars shall be expended by the United States for\r\nthe benefit of such of the poorer classes of Cherokees as shall remove\r\nwest.\r\n\r\n13. All Cherokees and their heirs to whom reservations had been made by\r\nany previous treaty, and who had not sold or disposed of the same, such\r\nreservations being subsequently sold by the United States should be\r\nentitled to receive the present value thereof from the United States as\r\nunimproved lands. All such reservations not sold were to be confirmed\r\nto the reservees or their heirs. All persons entitled to reservations\r\nunder treaty of 1817, whose reservations, as selected, were included by\r\nthe treaty of 1819 in the unceded lands of the Cherokee Nation, shall\r\nbe entitled to a grant for the same. All reservees who were obliged by\r\nthe laws of the States in which their reservations were situated to\r\nabandon the same or purchase them from the States, shall be deemed to\r\nhave a just claim against the United States for the value thereof or\r\nfor the amount paid therefor, with interest. The amount allowed for\r\nreservations under this article is to be paid independently, and not\r\nout of the consideration allowed to the Cherokees for spoliation claims\r\nand their cession of lands.\r\n\r\n14. Cherokee warriors wounded in the service of the United States\r\nduring the late war with Great Britain and the southern tribes of\r\nIndians shall be allowed such pensions as Congress shall provide.\r\n\r\n15. The balance of the consideration herein stated, after deducting\r\nthe amount actually expended for improvements, ferries, claims,\r\nspoliations, removal, subsistence, debts, and claims upon the Cherokee\r\nNation, additional quantity of lands, goods for the poorer class of\r\nCherokees, and the several sums to be invested for the general national\r\nfunds, shall be divided equally among all the people belonging to the\r\nCherokee Nation east, according to the census just completed. Certain\r\nCherokees who had removed west since June, 1833, were to be paid for\r\ntheir improvements.\r\n\r\n16. The Cherokees stipulate to remove west within two years from the\r\nratification of this treaty, during which time the United States shall\r\nprotect them in the possession and enjoyment of their property, and in\r\ncase of failure to do so shall pay all losses and damages sustained by\r\nthem in consequence thereof.\r\n\r\nThe United States and the several States interested in the Cherokee\r\nlands shall immediately proceed to survey the lands ceded by this\r\ntreaty, but the agency buildings and tract of land surveyed and laid\r\noff for the use of Col. R. J. Meigs, Indian agent, shall continue\r\nsubject to the control of the United States or such agent as may be\r\nspecially engaged in superintending the removal of the tribe.\r\n\r\n17. All claims arising under or provided for in this treaty shall\r\nbe examined and adjudicated by General William Carroll and John F.\r\nSchermerhorn, or by such commissioners as shall be appointed by the\r\nPresident of the United States for that purpose, and their decision\r\nshall be final, and the several claimants shall be paid on their\r\ncertificate by the United States. All stipulations of former treaties\r\nnot superseded or annulled by this treaty shall continue in force.\r\n\r\n18. The annuities of the nation which may accrue during the next two\r\nyears preceding their removal shall, on account of the failure of\r\ncrops, be expended in provision and clothing for the benefit of the\r\npoorer classes of the nation as soon after the ratification of this\r\ntreaty as an appropriation shall be made. So interference is, however,\r\nintended with that part of the annuities due the Cherokees west under\r\nthe treaty of 1819.\r\n\r\n19. This treaty is to be obligatory after ratification.\r\n\r\n20. The United States guarantee the payment of all unpaid just claims\r\nupon the Indians, without expense to them, out of the proper funds of\r\nthe United States for the settlement of which a cession or cessions\r\nof land has or have been heretofore made by the Indians in Georgia,\r\nprovided the United States or State of Georgia has derived benefit\r\ntherefrom without having made payment therefor.\r\n\r\nThis article was inserted by unanimous request of the Cherokee\r\ncommittee after the signing of the treaty, it being understood that\r\nits rejection by the Senate of the United States should not impair any\r\nother article of the treaty.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of December, 1835, James Rogers and John Smith, as\r\ndelegates from the Western Cherokees, signed an agreement which is\r\nattached to the treaty wherein they agreed to its provisions on behalf\r\nof the Western Cherokees, with the proviso that it should not affect\r\nany claims of the latter against the United States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 345: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 478.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY ARTICLES TO FOREGOING TREATY, CONCLUDED MARCH 1, 1836;\r\nPROCLAIMED MAY 23, 1836.[346]\r\n\r\n    _Agreed on between John F. Schermerhorn, commissioner on the\r\n    part of the United States, and the committee duly authorized at\r\n    a general council held at New Echota, Georgia, to act for and on\r\n    behalf of the Cherokee people._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nThese articles were concluded as supplementary to the treaty of\r\nDecember 29, 1835, and were ratified at the same time and as a part\r\nof that treaty. They were rendered necessary by the determination of\r\nPresident Jackson not to allow any pre-emptions or reservations, his\r\ndesire being that the whole Cherokee people should remove together to\r\nthe country west of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n1. All pre-emption rights and reservations provided for in articles 12\r\nand 13 are declared void.\r\n\r\n2. The Cherokees having supposed that the sum of $5,000,000, fixed\r\nas the value of Cherokee lands, did not include the amount required\r\nto remove them, nor the value of certain claims held by them against\r\ncitizens of the United States, and the President being willing that the\r\nsubject should be referred to the Senate of the United States for any\r\nfurther provision that body should deem just.\r\n\r\n3. It is agreed, should it receive the concurrence of that body, to\r\nallow the Cherokees the sum of $600,000, to include the expenses\r\nof removal and all claims against the United States not otherwise\r\nspecifically provided for, and to be in lieu of the aforesaid\r\nreservations and pre-emptions and of the $300,000 for spoliations\r\nprovided in article 1 of the original treaty to which this is\r\nsupplementary. This sum of $600,000 shall be applied and distributed\r\nagreeably to the provisions of said treaty, the surplus, if any, to\r\nbelong to the education fund.\r\n\r\n4. The provision of article 16 concerning the agency reservations is\r\nnot intended to interfere with the occupant right of any Cherokees\r\nwhose improvements may fall within the same.\r\n\r\nThe $100,000 appropriated in article 12 for the poorer class of\r\nCherokees, and intended as a set-off to the pre-emption rights, shall\r\nnow be added to the general national fund of $400,000.\r\n\r\n5. The expenses of negotiating the treaty and supplement and of such\r\npersons of the Cherokee delegation as may sign the same shall be\r\ndefrayed by the United States.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The following amendments were made by the United States Senate:\r\nIn article 17 strike out the words \"by General William Carroll and\r\nJohn F. Schermerhorn, or;\" also, in the same article, after the word\r\n\"States,\" insert \"by and with the advice and consent of the Senate of\r\nthe United States;\" and strike out the 20th article, which appears as a\r\nsupplemental article.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nZEALOUS MEASURES FOR REMOVAL OF EASTERN CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nWhile the events connected with the negotiation and the execution of\r\nthe treaty of 1828 with the Western Cherokees were occurring those\r\nCherokees who yet remained in their old homes east of the Mississippi\r\nRiver were burdened with a continually increasing catalogue of\r\ndistressing troubles. So soon as the treaty of 1828 was concluded it\r\nwas made known to them that inducements were therein held out for a\r\ncontinuance of the emigration to the Arkansas country. Agent Montgomery\r\nwas instructed[347] to use every means in his power to facilitate this\r\nscheme of removal, and especially among those Cherokees who resided\r\nwithin the chartered limits of Georgia.\r\n\r\nSecret agents were appointed and $2,000 were authorized by the\r\nSecretary of War to be expended in purchasing the influence of the\r\nchiefs in favor of the project.[348] A. R. S. Hunter and J. S. Bridges\r\nwere appointed[349] commissioners to value the improvements of the\r\nCherokees who should elect to remove.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly a year of zealous work in the cause, Agent Montgomery\r\nwas only able to report the emigration of four hundred and thirty-one\r\nIndians and seventy-nine slaves, comparatively few of whom were from\r\nGeorgia.[350] Nine months later three hundred and forty-six persons had\r\nemigrated from within the limits of that State.[351] The hostility\r\nmanifested by the larger proportion of the Cherokees toward those who\r\ngave favorable consideration to the plan of removal was so great as to\r\nrequire the establishment of a garrison of United States troops within\r\nthe nation for their protection.[350]\r\n\r\n_President Jackson's advice to the Cherokees._--Early in 1829,[352]\r\na delegation from the nation proceeded to Washington to lay their\r\ngrievances before President Jackson, but they found the Executive\r\nentertaining opinions about their rights very different from those\r\nwhich had been held by his predecessors. They were advised[353] that\r\nthe answer to their claim of being an independent nation was to be\r\nfound in the fact that during the Revolutionary war the Cherokees were\r\nthe allies of Great Britain, a power claiming entire sovereignty of\r\nthe thirteen colonies, which sovereignty, by virtue of the Declaration\r\nof Independence and the subsequent treaty of 1783, became vested\r\nrespectively in the thirteen original States, including North Carolina,\r\nand Georgia. If they had since been permitted to abide on their\r\nlands, it was by permission, a circumstance giving no right to deny\r\nthe sovereignty of those States. Under the treaty of 1785 the United\r\nStates \"give peace to all the Cherokees and receive them into favor and\r\nprotection.\" Subsequently they had made war on the United States, and\r\npeace was not concluded until 1791. No guarantee, however, was given by\r\nthe United States adverse to the sovereignty of Georgia, and none could\r\nbe given. Their course in establishing an independent government within\r\nthe limits of Georgia, adverse to her will, had been the cause of\r\ninducing her to depart from the forbearance she had so long practiced,\r\nand to provoke the passage of the recent[354] act of her legislature,\r\nextending her laws and jurisdiction over their country. The arms of\r\nthe United States, the President remarked, would never be employed to\r\nstay any State of the Union from the exercise of the legitimate powers\r\nbelonging to her in her sovereign capacity. No remedy for them, could\r\nbe perceived except removal west of the Mississippi River, where alone\r\npeace and protection could be afforded them. To continue where they\r\nwere could promise nothing but interruption and disquietude. Beyond the\r\nMississippi the United States, possessing the sole sovereignty, could\r\nsay to them that the land should be theirs while trees grow and water\r\nruns.\r\n\r\nThe delegation were much cast down by these expressions of the\r\nPresident, but they abated nothing of their demand for protection\r\nin what they considered to be the just rights of their people. They\r\nreturned to their country more embittered than before against the\r\nGeorgians, and lost no opportunity, by appeals to the patriotism as\r\nwell as to the baser passions of their countrymen, to excite them to a\r\ndetermination to protect their country at all hazards against Georgian\r\nencroachment and occupation.[355]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL CARROLL'S REPORT ON THE CONDITION OF THE CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nAbout this time[356] General William Carroll was designated by the\r\nPresident to make a tour through the Cherokee and Creek Nations, with\r\nboth of which he was supposed to possess much influence. His mission\r\nwas to urge upon them, and especially upon the former, the expediency\r\nof their removal west of the Mississippi under the inducements held\r\nout by the treaty of 1828. A month later[357] Col. E. F. Tatnall and\r\non the 8th of July General John Coffee were appointed to co-operate\r\nwith General Carroll in the accomplishment of his mission. The results\r\nof this tour were communicated[358] to the War Department by General\r\nCarroll in a report in which he remarked that nothing could be done\r\nwith the Cherokees by secret methods; they were too intelligent and too\r\nwell posted on the current news of the day to be long kept in ignorance\r\nof the methods and motives of those who came among them. He had met\r\ntheir leading men at Newtown and had submitted a proposal for their\r\nremoval which was peremptorily rejected. The advancement the Cherokees\r\nhad made in religion, morality, general information, and agriculture\r\nhad astonished him beyond measure. They had regular preachers in their\r\nchurches, the use of spirituous liquors was in great degree prohibited,\r\ntheir farms were worked much after the manner of white people, and were\r\ngenerally in good order. Many families possessed all the comforts and\r\nsome of the luxuries of life. Cattle, sheep, hogs, and fowl of every\r\nkind were found in great abundance. The Cherokees had been induced by\r\nEastern papers to believe the President was not sustained by the people\r\nin his views of their proposed removal. Eastern members of Congress had\r\ngiven their delegation to understand while in Washington the preceding\r\nspring that the memorial left by them protesting against the extension\r\nof the laws of Georgia and Alabama over Cherokee territory would be\r\nsustained by Congress, and that until that memorial had been definitely\r\nacted on by that body all propositions to them looking toward removal\r\nwould be worse than useless.\r\n\r\n_Cherokees refuse to cede lands in North Carolina._--In the early\r\nsummer of 1829[359] a commission had also been appointed, consisting of\r\nHumphrey Posey and a Mr. Saunders, having in view the purchase from the\r\nCherokees of that portion of their country within the limits of North\r\nCarolina, but it, too, failed wholly of accomplishing its purpose.\r\n\r\n_Coercive measures of the United States and Georgia._--Sundry\r\nexpedients were resorted to, both by the General Government and by the\r\nauthorities of Georgia, to compel the acquiescence of the Indians in\r\nthe demands for their emigration.\r\n\r\nThe act of the Georgia legislature of December 20, 1828, already\r\nalluded to, was an act \"to add the territory within this State and\r\noccupied by the Cherokee Indians to the counties of De Kalb _et\r\nal._, and to extend the laws of this State over the same.\" This was\r\nfollowed[360] by the passage of an act reasserting the territorial\r\njurisdiction of Georgia and annulling all laws made by the Cherokee\r\nIndians. It further declared that in any controversy arising between\r\nwhite persons and Indians the latter should be disqualified as\r\nwitnesses. Supplementary legislation of a similar character followed in\r\nquick succession, and the proclamation of the governor of the State was\r\nissued on the 3d of June, 1830, declaring the arrival of the date fixed\r\nby the aforesaid acts and the consequent subjection of the Cherokee\r\nterritory to the State laws and jurisdiction.[361]\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States about the same time gave\r\ndirections[362] to suspend the enrollment and removal of Cherokees to\r\nthe west in small parties, accompanied by the remark that if they (the\r\nCherokees) thought it for their interest to remain, they must take the\r\nconsequences, but that the Executive of the United States had no power\r\nto interfere with the exercise of the sovereignty of any State over and\r\nupon all within its limits. The President also directed[363] that the\r\nprevious practice of paying their annuities to the treasurer of the\r\nCherokee Nation should be discontinued, and that they be thereafter\r\ndistributed among the individual members of the tribe. Orders were\r\nshortly after[364] given to the commandant of troops in the Cherokee\r\ncountry to prevent _all persons_, including members of the tribe,\r\nfrom opening up or working any mineral deposits within their limits.\r\nAll these additional annoyances and restrictions placed upon the free\r\nexercise of their supposed rights, so far from securing compliance with\r\nthe wishes of the Government, had a tendency to harden the Cherokee\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF COLONEL LOWRY'S MISSION.\r\n\r\nIn this situation of affairs Col. John Lowry was appointed[365] a\r\nspecial commissioner to visit the Cherokee Nation and again lay before\r\nthem a formal proposition for their removal west. The substance of Mr.\r\nLowry's proposal as communicated by him to their national council[366]\r\nwas: (1) To give to the Cherokees a country west of the Mississippi,\r\nequal in value to the country they would leave; (2) each warrior and\r\nwidow living within the limits of Alabama or Tennessee was to be\r\npermitted, if so desiring, to select a reservation of 200 acres, which,\r\nif subsequently abandoned, was to be sold for the reservee's benefit;\r\n(3) each Indian desiring to become a citizen of the United States was\r\nto have a reservation in fee-simple; (4) all emigrants were to be\r\nremoved and fed one year at the expense of the United States, and to be\r\ncompensated for all property, except horses, they should leave behind\r\nthem, and, (5) the nation was to be provided with a liberal school fund.\r\n\r\nAgain the result was an emphatic refusal[367] on the part of the\r\nCherokees to enter into negotiations on the subject. Other special\r\ncommissioners and emissaries, of whom several were appointed in the\r\nnext few months, met with the same reception.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT IN CHEROKEE NATION VS. GEORGIA.\r\n\r\nDetermined to test the constitutionality of the hostile legislation\r\nof Georgia, application was made at the January term, 1831, of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, by John Ross, as principal chief,\r\nin the name of the Cherokee Nation, for an injunction against the\r\nState of Georgia. The application was based on the theory that the\r\nCherokee Nation was a sovereign and independent power in the sense\r\nof the language of the second section of the third article of the\r\nConstitution of the United States providing for judicial jurisdiction\r\nof cases arising between a State, or the citizens thereof, and foreign\r\nstates, citizens, or subjects. The majority of the court declared that\r\nthe Cherokee Nation was not a foreign nation in the sense stated in the\r\nConstitution, and dismissed the suit for want of jurisdiction. From\r\nthis decision, however, Justices Thompson and Story dissented.[368]\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF MR. CHESTER'S MISSION.\r\n\r\nNo further formal attempt was made to secure a compliance with the\r\nwishes of the Government until the winter and spring of 1831-'32. A\r\ndelegation of Cherokees had visited Washington in the interests of\r\ntheir people, and though nothing was accomplished through them, the\r\nlanguage used by some members of the delegation had led the Government\r\nauthorities to hope that a change of sentiment on the subject of\r\nremoval was rapidly taking place in their minds. In pursuance of\r\nthis impression the Secretary of War, in the spring of 1832,[369]\r\nintrusted Mr. E. W. Chester with a mission to the Cherokees, and with\r\ninstructions to offer them as a basis for the negotiation of a treaty\r\nthe following terms:\r\n\r\n1. The United States to provide them with a country west of Arkansas\r\nsufficiently large for their accommodation.\r\n\r\n2. This country to be conveyed to them by patent under the act of\r\nCongress of May 28, 1830, and to be forever outside the limits of any\r\nState or Territory.\r\n\r\n3. The Cherokees to retain and possess all the powers of\r\nself-government consistent with a supervisory authority of Congress.\r\n\r\n4. To have an agent resident in Washington to represent their interest,\r\nwho should be paid by the United States.\r\n\r\n5. With the consent of Congress they should be organized as a Territory\r\nand be represented by a delegate in that body.\r\n\r\n6. All white persons should be excluded from their country.\r\n\r\n7. The United States to remove them to their new country and to pay the\r\nexpenses of such removal, which might be conducted in either of three\r\nways, viz:\r\n\r\n(_a_) By a commutation in money, to be allowed either individuals or\r\nfamilies.\r\n\r\n(_b_) By persons to be appointed and paid by the United States.\r\n\r\n(_c_) By arrangement among themselves, through which some competent\r\nperson should remove them at a fixed rate.\r\n\r\n8. The United States to provide them with subsistence for one year\r\nafter removal.\r\n\r\n9. An annuity to be secured to them proportioned to the value of the\r\ncession of territory they should make.\r\n\r\n10. The United States to pay for all Indian improvements upon the ceded\r\nland.\r\n\r\n11. Provision to be made for the support of schools, teachers,\r\nblacksmiths and their supplies, mills, school-houses, churches,\r\ncouncil-houses, and houses for the principal chiefs.\r\n\r\n12. A rifle to be presented to each adult male, and blankets, axes,\r\nplows, hoes, spinning-wheels, cards, and looms to each family.\r\n\r\n13. Indian live stock to be valued and paid for by the United States.\r\n\r\n14. Annuities under former treaties to be paid to them upon their\r\narrival west of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n15. Provision to be made by the United States for Cherokee orphan\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n16. Protection to be guaranteed to the Cherokees against hostile\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\n17. A few individual reservations to be permitted east of the\r\nMississippi, but only on condition that the reservees shall become\r\ncitizens of the State in which they reside, and that all reservations\r\nbetween them and the United States, founded upon their previous\r\ncircumstances as Indians, must cease.\r\n\r\n_Cherokees contemplate removal to Columbia River._--In the discussion\r\nof these propositions the fact was developed that a project had been\r\ncanvassed, and had received much favorable consideration among the\r\nCherokees themselves (in view of the difficulties and harassing\r\ncircumstances surrounding their situation), to abandon their eastern\r\nhome and to remove to the country adjacent to the mouth of the\r\nColumbia River, on the Pacific coast. This proposition having reached\r\nthe ears of the Secretary of War, he made haste, in a letter to Mr.\r\nChester,[370] to discourage all idea of such a removal, predicated\r\nupon the theory that they would be surrounded by tribes of hostile\r\nsavages, and would be too remote from the frontier and military posts\r\nof the United States to enable the latter to extend to them the arm of\r\nprotection and support.\r\n\r\nNothing was accomplished by the negotiations of Mr. Chester, and in\r\nthe autumn[371] of the same year Governor Lumpkin, of Georgia, was\r\nrequested to attend the Cherokee council in October and renew the\r\nproposition upon the same basis. A similar fate attended this attempt.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECISION OF SUPREME COURT IN WORCESTER VS. GEORGIA.\r\n\r\nAmong other laws passed by the State of Georgia was one that went into\r\neffect on the 1st of February, 1831, which prohibited the Cherokees\r\nfrom holding councils, or assembling for any purpose; provided for a\r\ndistribution of their lands among her citizens; required all whites\r\nresiding in the Cherokee Nation within her chartered limits to take an\r\noath of allegiance to the State, and made it an offense punishable by\r\nfour years' imprisonment in the penitentiary to refuse to do so. Under\r\nthis law two missionaries, Messrs. Worcester and Butler, were indicted\r\nin the superior court of Gwinnett County for residing without license\r\nin that part of the Cherokee country attached to Georgia by her laws\r\nand in violation of the act of her legislature approved December 22,\r\n1830. In the trial of Mr. Worcester's case, which was subsequently made\r\nthe test case in the Supreme Court of the United States, he pleaded\r\nthat he was a citizen of Vermont and entered the Cherokee country as a\r\nmissionary with the permission of the President of the United States\r\nand the approval of the Cherokee Nation; that Georgia ought not to\r\nmaintain the prosecution inasmuch as several treaties had been entered\r\ninto by the United States with the Cherokee Nation, by which the latter\r\nwere acknowledged as a sovereign nation, and by which the territory\r\noccupied by them had been guaranteed to them by the United States.\r\nThe superior court overruled this plea, and Mr. Worcester was tried,\r\nconvicted, and sentenced to four years in the penitentiary.\r\n\r\nThe case was carried up on a writ of error to the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States, and that court asserted its jurisdiction. In rendering\r\nits decision the court remarks that the principle that discovery of\r\nparts of the continent of America gave title to the government by\r\nwhose subjects or by whose authority it was made against all other\r\nEuropean governments, which title might be consummated by possession,\r\nwas acknowledged by all Europeans because it was the interest of all to\r\nacknowledge it, and because it gave to the nation making the discovery,\r\nas its inevitable consequence, the sole right of acquiring the soil\r\nand of making settlements on it. It was an exclusive principle which\r\nshut out the right of competition among those who had agreed to it,\r\nbut not one which could annul the rights of those who had not agreed\r\nto it. It regulated the rights of the discoverers among themselves,\r\nbut could not affect the rights of those already in possession as\r\naboriginal occupants. It gave the exclusive right of purchase, but\r\ndid not found it on a denial of the right of the possessor to sell.\r\nThe United States succeeded to all the claims of Great Britain, both\r\nterritorial and political. Soon after Great Britain had determined on\r\nplanting colonies in America the King granted sundry charters to his\r\nsubjects. They purport generally to convey the soil from the Atlantic\r\nto the South Sea. The soil was occupied by numerous warlike nations,\r\nmilling and able to defend their possessions. The absurd idea that\r\nfeeble settlements made on the sea-coast acquired legitimate power to\r\ngovern the people or occupy the lands from sea to sea did not then\r\nenter the mind of any man. These charters simply conferred the right\r\nof purchasing such lands as the natives were willing to sell. The\r\nacknowledgment of dependence made in the various Cherokee treaties with\r\nGreat Britain and the United States merely bound them as a dependent\r\nally claiming the protection of a powerful friend and neighbor and\r\nreceiving the advantages of that protection, without involving a\r\nsurrender of their national character. Neither the Government nor the\r\nCherokees ever understood it otherwise. Protection did not imply the\r\ndestruction of the protected.\r\n\r\nGeorgia herself had furnished conclusive evidence that her former\r\nopinions on the subject of the Indians concurred with those entertained\r\nby her sister States and by the Government of the United States.\r\nVarious acts of her legislature had been cited in the argument of the\r\ncase, including the contract of cession made in 1802, all tending to\r\nprove her acquiescence in the universal conviction that the Cherokee\r\nNation possessed a full right to the lands they occupied, until that\r\nright should be extinguished by the United States with their consent;\r\nthat their territory was separated from that of any State within whose\r\nchartered limits they might reside, by a boundary line established by\r\ntreaties; that within their boundary they possessed rights with which\r\nno State could interfere, and that the whole power of regulating the\r\nintercourse with them was vested in the United States. The legislation\r\nof Georgia on this subject was therefore unconstitutional and void.[372]\r\n\r\n_Georgia refuses to submit to the decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt._--Georgia refused to submit to the decision and alleged that the\r\ncourt possessed no right to pronounce it, she being by the Constitution\r\nof the United States a sovereign and independent State, and no new\r\nState could be formed within her limits without her consent.\r\n\r\n_President Jackson's dilemma._--The President was thus placed between\r\ntwo fires, Georgia demanding the force of his authority to protect\r\nher constitutional rights by refusing to enforce the decision of the\r\ncourt, and the Cherokees demanding the maintenance of their rights as\r\nguaranteed them under the treaty of 1791 and sustained by the decision\r\nof the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nIt was manifest the request of both could not be complied with. If\r\nhe assented to the desire of the Cherokees a civil war was likely to\r\nensue with the State of Georgia. If he did not enforce the decision and\r\nprotect the Cherokees, the faith of the nation would be violated.[373]\r\nIn this dilemma a treaty was looked upon as the only alternative, by\r\nwhich the Cherokees should relinquish to the United States all their\r\ninterest in lands east of the Mississippi and remove to the west of\r\nthat river, and more earnest, urgent, and persistent pressure than\r\nbefore was applied from this time forward to compel their acquiescence\r\nin such a scheme.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISPUTED BOUNDARIES BETWEEN CHEROKEES AND CREEKS.\r\n\r\nMention has already been made in discussing the terms of the treaty of\r\nSeptember 22, 1816, of the complications arising out of the question\r\nof disputed boundaries between the Cherokees, Creeks, Choctaws,\r\nand Chickasaws. These disputes related chiefly to an adjustment of\r\nboundaries within the Territory of Alabama, rendered necessary for the\r\ndefinite ascertainment of the limits of the Creek cession of 1814. But\r\nas a result of the Cherokee cession of 1817 and the Creek cessions of\r\n1818, 1821, 1826, and 1827, the true boundary between the territories\r\nof these two latter nations became not only a matter of dispute, but\r\none that for years lent additional bitterness to the contest between\r\nthe people of Georgia and the Indians, especially the Cherokees. Prior\r\nto the Revolution, the latter had claimed to own the territory within\r\nthe limits of Georgia, as far south as the waters of Broad River, and\r\nextending from the headwaters of that river westward. Some of this\r\nterritory was also claimed by the Creeks, and the British Government\r\nhad therefore in purchasing it accepted a cession from those tribes\r\njointly.[374]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Federal relations with the Cherokees, a\r\ndefinition of their boundaries had been made by treaty of November\r\n28, 1785, extending on the south as far west as the headwaters of the\r\nAppalachee River. Beyond that point to the west no declaration as\r\nto the limits of the Cherokee territory was made, because, for the\r\npurposes of the Federal Government, none was at that time necessary.\r\nBut when in course of time other cessions came to be made, both by\r\nthe Cherokees and Creeks, it began to be essential to have an exact\r\ndefinition of the line of limits between them. Especially was this\r\nthe case when, as by the terms of the Creek treaty of February 12,\r\n1825,[375] they ceded all the territory to which they laid claim within\r\nthe limits of Georgia, and although this treaty was afterwards declared\r\nvoid by the United States, because of alleged fraud, Georgia always\r\nmaintained the propriety and validity of its negotiation.\r\n\r\nAs early as June 10, 1802, a delegation of Cherokees interviewed\r\nColonel Hawkins and General Pickens, and after demanding the removal of\r\ncertain settlers claimed to be on their lands, asserted the boundary of\r\ntheir nation in the direction of the Creeks to be the path running from\r\nColonel Easley's, at High Shoals of the Appalachee, to Etowah River.\r\nThis they had agreed upon in council with the Creeks. A delegation of\r\nthe Creeks, whom they brought with them from the council, were then\r\ninterrogated on the subject by Messrs. Hawkins and Pickens, and they\r\nreplied that the statement of the Cherokees was correct.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1814 (May 15) Agent Meigs had written the Secretary of\r\nWar that the Cherokees were sensible that the Creeks ought to cede to\r\nthe United States sufficient land to fully compensate the latter for\r\nthe expenses incurred in prosecuting the Creek war. However, they (the\r\nCherokees) were incidentally interested in the arrangements, and hoped\r\nthat the United States would not permit the Creeks to point out the\r\nspecific boundaries of their cession until the division line between\r\nthe two nations had been definitely determined. In the following year,\r\nin a discussion of the subject with Colonel Hawkins, the Creek agent,\r\nColonel Meigs declares that the Cherokees repel the idea entertained by\r\nthe Creeks that the Cherokee or Tennessee River was ever their southern\r\nboundary. On the contrary, the dividing line between the territories\r\nof the two nations should begin at Vann's Old Store, on the Ocmulgee\r\nRiver, thence pursuing such a course as would strike the Coosa River\r\nbelow the Ten Islands. This claim was predicated upon the assertion\r\nthat the Cherokees had in the course of three successive wars with\r\nthe Creeks driven them more than a degree of latitude below the point\r\nlast named. Another Cherokee version was to the effect that at a joint\r\ncouncil of the two nations, held prior to the Revolutionary War, the\r\nboundary question was a subject of discussion, when it was agreed to\r\nallow the oldest man in the Creek Nation to determine the point. This\r\nman was James McQueen, a soldier who had deserted from Oglethorpe's\r\ncommand soon after the settlement of Savannah. McQueen decided that the\r\nboundary should be a line drawn across the headwaters of Hatchet and\r\nElk Creeks, the former being a branch of the Coosa and the latter a\r\ntributary of the Tallapoosa. This decision was predicated upon the fact\r\nthat the Cherokees had driven the Creeks below this line, and it had\r\nbeen mutually agreed that it should constitute the boundary.\r\n\r\nIn contradiction of this it was asserted by the Creeks that in the year\r\n1818 it had been admitted at a public meeting of the Creeks by \"Sour\r\nMush,\" a Cherokee chief, that the Creeks owned all the land up to the\r\nhead of Coosa River, including all of its waters; that the Tennessee\r\nwas the Cherokee River, and the territories of the two nations joined\r\non the dividing ridge between those rivers. In former times, on the\r\nChattahoochee, the Cherokees had claimed the country as low down as\r\na branch of that river called Choky (Soquee) River. Subsequently\r\nthey were told by the Coweta king, that they might live as low down\r\nas the Currahee Mountain, but that their young men had now extended\r\ntheir claim to Hog Mountain, without however any shadow of right or\r\nauthority.[376]\r\n\r\nWith a view to an amicable adjustment of their respective rights a\r\ncouncil was held between the chiefs and headmen of the two nations\r\nat the residence of General William McIntosh, in the Creek country,\r\nat which a treaty was concluded between themselves on the 11th of\r\nDecember, 1820. In the first article of this treaty the boundary line\r\nbetween the two nations was fixed as running from the Buzzard's Roost,\r\non the Chattahoochee, in a direct line to the Coosa River, at a point\r\nopposite the mouth of Wills Town Creek, and thence down the Coosa River\r\nto a point opposite Fort Strother. This boundary was reaffirmed by them\r\nin a subsequent treaty concluded October 30, 1822.[377]\r\n\r\nThe Cherokee treaty of 1817 had assumed to cede a tract of country\r\n\"Beginning at the high shoals of the Appalachy River and running\r\nthence along the boundary line between the Creek and Cherokee Nations\r\nwestwardly to the Chatahouchy River,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe Creek treaty of 1818[378] in turn ceded a tract the northern\r\nboundary of which extended from Suwanee Old Town, on the Chattahoochee,\r\nto the head of Appalachee River, and which overlapped a considerable\r\nportion of the Cherokee cession of 1817.\r\n\r\nThe Creek treaty of 1821[379] ceded a tract running as far north as the\r\nShallow Ford of the Chattahoochee, which also included a portion of\r\nthe territory within the limits of the Cherokee domain, as claimed by\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of 1825[380] with the Creeks they ceded all their\r\nremaining territory in Georgia. Complaint being made that this treaty\r\nhad been entered into by only a small non-representative faction of\r\nthat nation, an investigation was entered upon by the United States\r\nauthorities, and as the result it was determined to declare the treaty\r\nvoid and to negotiate a new treaty with them, which was done on the\r\n24th of January, 1826.[381]\r\n\r\nBy this last treaty as amended the Creeks ceded all their land east\r\nof the Chattahoochee River, as well as a tract north and west of that\r\nriver. In the cession of this latter tract it was assumed that a point\r\non Chattahoochee River known as the Buzzard's Roost was the northern\r\nlimit of the Creek supremacy.\r\n\r\nThe authorities of Georgia strongly insisted that not only had the\r\ntreaty of 1825 been legitimately concluded, whereby they were entitled\r\nto come into possession of all the Creek domain within her limits, but\r\nalso that the true line of the Creek limits toward the north had been\r\nmuch higher up than would seem to have been the understanding of the\r\nparties to the treaty of 1826.\r\n\r\nIn the following year the Creeks ceded all remaining territory they\r\nmight have within the limits of Georgia.[382] This left the only\r\nquestion to be decided between the State of Georgia and the Cherokees\r\nthe one of just boundaries between the latter and the country recently\r\nacquired from the Creeks.\r\n\r\nThe War Department had been of the impression that the proper boundary\r\nbetween the two nations was a line to be run directly from the High\r\nShoals of the Appalachee to the Ten Islands, or Turkeytown, on the\r\nCoosa River.[383] On this hypothesis Agent Mitchell, of the Creeks,\r\nhad been instructed, if he could do so, \"without exciting their\r\nsensibilities,\" to establish it as the northern line of the Creek\r\nNation.\r\n\r\nGeorgia, on the contrary, claimed that the proper boundary extended\r\nfrom Suwanee Old Town, on the Chattahoochee, to Sixes Old Town, on the\r\nEtowah River; from thence to the junction of the Etowah and Oostanaula\r\nRivers, and following the Creek path from that point to Tennessee\r\nRiver. In pursuance of this claim Governor Forsyth instructed[384] Mr.\r\nSamuel A. Wales as the surveyor for that State to proceed to establish\r\nthe line of limits in accordance therewith. Mr. Wales, upon commencing\r\noperations, was met with a protest from Colonel Montgomery, the\r\nCherokee agent,[385] notwithstanding which he continued his operations\r\nin conformity with his original instructions.\r\n\r\nThis action of the surveyor having produced a feeling of great\r\nexcitement and hostility within the Cherokee Nation, rendering\r\nthe danger of collision and bloodshed imminent, the United States\r\nauthorities took the matter in hand, and, by direction of the\r\nPresident, General John Coffee was appointed and instructed[386] to\r\nproceed to the Cherokee Nation, and from the most reliable information\r\nand testimony attainable to report what, in his judgment, should in\r\njustice and fairness to all parties concerned be declared to be the\r\ntrue line of limits between Georgia, as the successor of the Creeks,\r\nand the Cherokee Nation.\r\n\r\nGeneral Coffee proceeded to the performance of the duty thus assigned\r\nhim. A large mass of testimony and tradition on the subject was evoked,\r\nin summing up which General Coffee reported[387] to the Secretary of\r\nWar that the line of demarkation between the two nations should begin\r\nat the lower Shallow Ford of the Chattahoochee, which was about 15\r\nmiles below the Suwanee Old Town. From thence the line should run\r\nwestwardly in a direction to strike the ridge dividing the waters\r\nrunning into Little River (a branch of the Hightower or Etowah) from\r\nthose running into Sweet Water Creek (a branch of the Chattahoochee\r\nemptying about 2 miles below Buzzard's Roost). From this point such\r\nridge should be followed westwardly, leaving all the waters falling\r\ninto Hightower and Coosa Rivers to the right and all the waters that\r\nrun southwardly into Chattahoochee and Tallapoosa Rivers to the left,\r\nuntil such ridge should intersect the line (which had been previously\r\nas per agreement of 1821 between the Creeks and Cherokees themselves)\r\nrun and marked from Buzzard Roost to Wills Creek, and thence with this\r\nline to the Coosa River opposite the mouth of Wills Creek.\r\n\r\nTwo weeks later[388] General Coffee, in a communication to the\r\nSecretary of War, alludes to the dissatisfaction of Georgia with the\r\nline as determined by him, and her claim to an additional tract of\r\nterritory by remarking that \"I have thought it right to give this\r\nstatement for your own and the eye of the President only, that you may\r\nthe better appreciate the character of the active agents and partisans\r\nof the Georgia claim, for really I cannot see any reasonable or\r\nplausible evidence on which she rests her claim.\"\r\n\r\nThe President, after a careful examination of the testimony and much\r\nsolicitude upon the subject, decided to approve General Coffee's\r\nrecommendation. The Cherokee agent was therefore directed[389] to\r\nnotify all white settlers living north of Coffee's line to remove at\r\nonce. The governor of Georgia was also notified of the President's\r\ndecision, and, though strongly and persistently protesting against it,\r\nthe President firmly refused to revoke his action.[390] The Cherokees\r\nwere equally dissatisfied with the decision, because the line was not\r\nfixed as far south as Buzzard's Roost, in accordance with the agreement\r\nof 1821 between themselves and the Creeks.[391]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEES PLEAD WITH CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENT FOR JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nA delegation of the Cherokees, with John Ross at their head, was\r\nquartered in Washington during the greater part of the winter of\r\n1832-'33, bringing to bear in behalf of their nation every possible\r\ninfluence upon both Congress and the Executive. A voluminous\r\ncorrespondence was conducted between them and the War Department upon\r\nthe subject of their proposed removal. In a communication on the 28th\r\nof January, 1833, they ask leave to say that, notwithstanding the\r\nvarious perplexities which the Cherokee people had experienced under\r\nthe course of policy pursued toward them, they were yet unshaken in\r\ntheir objections to a removal west of the Mississippi River. On the\r\nquestion of their rights and the justice of their cause, their minds\r\nwere equally unchangeable. They were, however, fully sensible that\r\njustice and weakness could not control the array of oppressive power,\r\nand that in the calamitous effects of such power, already witnessed,\r\nthey could not fail to foresee with equal clearness that a removal to\r\nthe west would be followed in a few years by consequences no less fatal.\r\n\r\nThey therefore suggested for the consideration of the President,\r\nwhether it would not be practicable for the Government to satisfy the\r\nclaims of Georgia by granting to those of her citizens who had in the\r\nlotteries of that State drawn lots of land within Cherokee limits\r\nother lands of the United States lying within the Territories and\r\nStates of the Union, or in some other way.\r\n\r\n_The President urges their assent to removal._--The Secretary of War,\r\nin replying for the President (February 2,1833), was unable to see that\r\nany practicable plan could be adopted by which the reversionary rights\r\nheld under the State of Georgia could be purchased upon such terms as\r\nwould justify the Government in entering into a stipulation to that\r\neffect. Nor would it at all remove the difficulties and embarrassments\r\nof their condition. They would still be subject to the laws of Georgia,\r\nsurrounded by white settlements and exposed to all those evils\r\nwhich had always attended the Indian race when placed in immediate\r\ncontact with the white population. It was only by removing from these\r\nsurroundings that they could expect to avoid the fate which had already\r\nswept away so many Indian tribes.\r\n\r\n_Reply of John Ross._--Ross retorted, in a communication couched\r\nin diplomatic language, that it was with great diffidence and deep\r\nregret he felt constrained to say, that in this scheme of Indian\r\nremoval he could see more of expediency and policy to get rid of\r\nthe Cherokees than to perpetuate their race upon any permanent,\r\nfundamental principle. If the doctrine that Indian tribes could not\r\nexist contiguous to a white population should prevail, and they should\r\nbe compelled to remove west of the States and Territories of this\r\nrepublic, what was to prevent a similar removal of them from there for\r\nthe same reason?\r\n\r\nWithout securing any promises of relief, and without reaching\r\nany definite understanding with the executive authorities of the\r\nGovernment, the delegation left for their homes in March, 1833. They\r\nagreed, however, to lay before their national council in the ensuing\r\nMay a proposition made to them by the President, offering to pay them\r\n$2,500,000 in goods for their lands, with the proviso that they should\r\nremove themselves at their own expense.[392] This proposition, it\r\nis hardly necessary to remark, was not favorably considered by the\r\ncouncil, though the Secretary of War designated[393] Mr. Benjamin F.\r\nCurry to attend the meeting and urge its acceptance.\r\n\r\n_Alleged attempted bribery of John Ross._--In this connection a story\r\nhaving been given currency that the Government had offered Chief Ross a\r\nbribe, provided he would secure the conclusion of a treaty of cession\r\nand removal, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs denied it as being\r\n\"utterly without foundation, and one of those vile expedients that\r\nunprincipled men sometimes practice to accomplish an evil purpose,\"\r\nand as being \"too incredible to do much injury.\"[394] While this\r\nstory was perhaps without solid foundation in fact, its improbability\r\nwould possibly have been more evident but for the fact that only five\r\nyears earlier the Secretary of War had appointed secret agents and\r\nauthorized them to expend $2,000 in bribing the chiefs for this very\r\npurpose, and had made his action in this respect a matter of public\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEES PROPOSE AN ADJUSTMENT.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1834, a few weeks after the assembling of Congress, the\r\nCherokee delegation again arrived in Washington.[395] Sundry interviews\r\nand considerable correspondence with the War Department seemed barren\r\nof results or even hope. The delegation submitted[396] a proposition\r\nfor adjustment in another form. Remarking upon their feeble numbers,\r\nand surrounded as they were by a nation so powerful as the United\r\nStates, they could not but clearly see, they said, that their existence\r\nand permanent welfare as a people must depend upon that relation which\r\nshould eventually lead to an amalgamation with the people of the United\r\nStates. As the prospects of securing this object collectively, in their\r\npresent location in the character of a territorial or State government,\r\nseemed to be seriously opposed and threatened by the States interested\r\nin their own aggrandizement, and as the Cherokees had refused, and\r\nwould never voluntarily consent, to remove west of the Mississippi,\r\nthe question was propounded whether the Government would enter into\r\nan arrangement on the basis of the Cherokees becoming prospectively\r\ncitizens of the United States, provided the former would cede to the\r\nUnited States a portion of their territory for the use of Georgia; and\r\nwhether the United States would agree to have the laws and treaties\r\nexecuted and enforced for the effectual protection of the Cherokees\r\non the remainder of their territory for a definite period, with the\r\nunderstanding that upon the expiration of that period the Cherokees\r\nwere to be subjected to the laws of the States within whose limits\r\nthey might be, and to take an individual standing as citizens thereof,\r\nthe same as other free citizens of the United States, with liberty to\r\ndispose of their surplus lands in such manner as might be agreed upon.\r\n\r\n_Cherokee proposals declined._--The reply[397] to this proposition was\r\nthat the President did not see the slightest hope of a termination to\r\nthe embarrassments under which the Cherokees labored except in their\r\nremoval to the country west of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n_Proposal of Andrew Ross._--In the mean time[398] Andrew Ross, who was\r\na member of the Cherokee delegation, suggested to the Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs that if he were authorized so to do he would proceed to\r\nthe Cherokee country and bring a few chiefs or respectable individuals\r\nof the nation to Washington, with whom a treaty could be effected\r\nfor the cession of the whole or part of the Cherokee territory. His\r\nplan was approved, with the understanding that if a treaty should be\r\nconcluded the expenses of the delegation would be paid by the United\r\nStates. Ross succeeded in assembling some fifteen or twenty Cherokees\r\nat the Cherokee agency, all of whom were favorable to the scheme of\r\nemigration. Under the self-styled appellation of a committee, they\r\nproceeded to appoint a chief and assistant chief in the persons of\r\nWilliam Hicks and John McIntosh, and selected eight of their own number\r\nas the remainder of the delegation to visit Washington.[399]\r\n\r\n_Protest of John Ross and thirteen thousand Cherokees._--Upon\r\ntheir arrival Hon. J. H. Eaton was designated[400] to conduct the\r\nnegotiations with them. During the pendency of the negotiations Mr.\r\nBaton advised John Ross of the purpose in view and solicited his\r\nco-operation in the scheme. Mr. Ross refused[401] this proposal with\r\nmuch warmth, and took occasion to add in behalf of the Cherokee Nation\r\nthat \"in the face of Heaven and earth, before God and man, I most\r\nsolemnly protest against any treaty whatever being entered into with\r\nthose of whom you say one is in progress so as to affect the rights and\r\ninterests of the Cherokee Nation east of the Mississippi River.\"\r\n\r\nChief Ross also presented a protest, alleged to have been signed by\r\nmore than thirteen thousand Cherokees, against the negotiation of such\r\na treaty.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary treaty concluded with Andrew Ross et al._--Disregarding\r\nthe protest of Chief Ross and distrusting the verity of that purporting\r\nto have been so numerously signed in the nation, the negotiations\r\nproceeded, and a treaty or agreement was concluded on the 19th day of\r\nJune, 1834. The treaty provided for the opening of emigrant enrolling\r\nbooks, with a memorandum heading declaring the assent of the subscriber\r\nto a treaty yet to be concluded with the United States based upon the\r\nterms previously offered by the President, covering a cession and\r\nremoval, and with the proviso that if no such subsequent treaty should\r\nbe concluded within the next few months then the subscribers would\r\ncede to the United States all their right and interest in the Cherokee\r\nlands east of the Mississippi. In consideration of this they were to be\r\nremoved and subsisted for one year at the expense of the United States,\r\nto receive the ascertained value of their improvements, and to be\r\nentitled to all such stipulations as should thereafter be made in favor\r\nof those who should not then remove.\r\n\r\nThe treaty, however, failed of ratification, though the enrolling books\r\nwere opened[402] and a few of the Cherokees entered their names for\r\nemigration.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEES MEMORIALIZE CONGRESS.\r\n\r\nWhile the negotiations leading up to the conclusion of this treaty\r\nwere in progress John Ross and his delegation, finding no disposition\r\non the part of the executive authority to enter into a discussion of\r\nCherokee affairs predicated upon any other basis than an abandonment by\r\nthem of their homes and country east of the Mississippi, presented[403]\r\na memorial to Congress complaining of the injuries done them and\r\npraying for redress. Without affecting to pass judgment on the merits\r\nof the controversy, the writer thinks this memorial well deserving of\r\nreproduction here as evidencing the devoted and pathetic attachment\r\nwith which the Cherokees clung to the land of their fathers, and,\r\nremembering the wrongs and humiliations of the past, refused to be\r\nconvinced that justice, prosperity, and happiness awaited them beyond\r\nthe Mississippi.\r\n\r\n    The memorial of the Cherokee Nation respectfully showeth,\r\n    that they approach your honorable bodies as the representatives\r\n    of the people of the United States, intrusted by them under the\r\n    Constitution with the exercise of their sovereign power, to ask for\r\n    protection of the rights of your memorialists and redress of their\r\n    grievances.\r\n\r\n    They respectfully represent that their rights, being stipulated\r\n    by numerous solemn treaties, which guaranteed to them protection,\r\n    and guarded as they supposed by laws enacted by Congress, they\r\n    had hoped that the approach of danger would be prevented by the\r\n    interposition of the power of the Executive charged with the\r\n    execution of treaties and laws; and that when their rights should\r\n    come in question they would be finally and authoritatively decided\r\n    by the judiciary, whose decrees it would be the duty of the\r\n    Executive to see carried into effect. For many years these their\r\n    just hopes were not disappointed.\r\n\r\n    The public faith of the United States, solemnly pledged\r\n    to them, was duly kept in form and substance. Happy under the\r\n    parental guardianship of the United States, they applied themselves\r\n    assiduously and successfully to learn the lessons of civilization\r\n    and peace, which, in the prosecution of a humane and Christian\r\n    policy, the United States caused to be taught them. Of the advances\r\n    they have made under the influence of this benevolent system,\r\n    they might a few years ago have been tempted to speak with pride\r\n    and satisfaction and with grateful hearts to those who have been\r\n    their instructors. They could have pointed with pleasure to the\r\n    houses they had built, the improvements they had made, the fields\r\n    they were cultivating; they could have exhibited their domestic\r\n    establishments, and shown how from wandering in the forests many of\r\n    them had become the heads of families, with fixed habitations, each\r\n    the center of a domestic circle like that which forms the happiness\r\n    of civilized man. They could have shown, too, how the arts of\r\n    industry, human knowledge, and letters had been introduced amongst\r\n    them, and how the highest of all the knowledge had come to bless\r\n    them, teaching them to know and to worship the Christian's God,\r\n    bowing down to Him at the same seasons and in the same spirit with\r\n    millions of His creatures who inhabit Christendom, and with them\r\n    embracing the hopes and promises of the Gospel.\r\n\r\n    But now each of these blessings has been made to them an\r\n    instrument of the keenest torture. Cupidity has fastened its\r\n    eye upon their lands and their homes, and is seeking by force\r\n    and by every variety of oppression and wrong to expel them from\r\n    their lands and their homes and to tear them from all that has\r\n    become endeared to them. Of what they have already suffered it\r\n    is impossible for them to give the details, as they would make a\r\n    history. Of what they are menaced with by unlawful power, every\r\n    citizen of the United States who reads the public journals is\r\n    aware. In this their distress they have appealed to the judiciary\r\n    of the United States, where their rights have been solemnly\r\n    established. They have appealed to the Executive of the United\r\n    States to protect these rights according to the obligations\r\n    of treaties and the injunctions of the laws. But this appeal\r\n    to the Executive has been made in vain. In the hope that by\r\n    yielding something of their clear rights they might succeed in\r\n    obtaining security for the remainder, they have lately opened a\r\n    correspondence with the Executive, offering to make a considerable\r\n    cession from what had been reserved to them by solemn treaties,\r\n    only upon condition that they might be protected in the part not\r\n    ceded. But their earnest supplication has been unheeded, and the\r\n    only answer they can get, informs them, in substance, that they\r\n    must be left to their fate, or renounce the whole. What that fate\r\n    is to be unhappily is too plain.\r\n\r\n    The State of Georgia has assumed jurisdiction over them, has\r\n    invaded their territory, has claimed the right to dispose of their\r\n    lands, and has actually proceeded to dispose of them, reserving\r\n    only a small portion to individuals, and even these portions are\r\n    threatened and will no doubt, soon be taken from them. Thus the\r\n    nation is stripped of its territory and individuals of their\r\n    property without the least color of right, and in open violation\r\n    of the guarantee of treaties. At the same time the Cherokees,\r\n    deprived of the protection of their own government and laws, are\r\n    left without the protection of any other laws, outlawed as it were\r\n    and exposed to indignities, imprisonment, persecution, and even to\r\n    death, though they have committed no offense whatever, save and\r\n    except that of seeking to enjoy what belongs to them, and refusing\r\n    to yield it up to those who have no pretense of title to it. Of the\r\n    acts of the legislature of Georgia your memorialists will endeavor\r\n    to furnish copies to your honorable bodies, and of the doings\r\n    of individuals they will furnish evidence if required. And your\r\n    memorialists further respectfully represent that the Executive of\r\n    the United States has not only refused to protect your memorialists\r\n    against the wrongs they have suffered and are still suffering at\r\n    the hands of unjust cupidity, but has done much more. It is but too\r\n    plain that, for several years past, the power of the Executive has\r\n    been exerted on the side of their oppressors and is co-operating\r\n    with them in the work of destruction. Of two particulars in the\r\n    conduct of the Executive your memorialists would make mention, not\r\n    merely as matters of evidence but as specific subjects of complaint\r\n    in addition to the more general ones already stated.\r\n\r\n    The first of these is the mode adopted to oppress and injure\r\n    your memorialists under color of enrollments for emigration. Unfit\r\n    persons are introduced as agents, acts are practiced by them that\r\n    are unjust, unworthy, and demoralizing, and have no object but\r\n    to force your memorialists to yield and abandon their rights by\r\n    making their lives intolerably wretched. They forbear to go into\r\n    particulars, which nevertheless they are prepared, at a proper\r\n    time, to exhibit.\r\n\r\n    The other is calculated also to weaken and distress your\r\n    memorialists, and is essentially unjust. Heretofore, until within\r\n    the last four years, the money appropriated by Congress for\r\n    annuities has been paid to the nation, by whom it was distributed\r\n    and used for the benefit of the nation. And this method of payment\r\n    was not only sanctioned by the usage of the Government of the\r\n    United States, but was acceptable to the Cherokees. Yet, without\r\n    any cause known to your memorialists, and contrary to their just\r\n    expectations, the payment has been withheld for the period just\r\n    mentioned, on the ground, then for the first time assumed, that the\r\n    annuities were to be paid, not as hitherto, to the nation, but to\r\n    the individual Cherokees, each his own small fraction, dividing the\r\n    whole according to the numbers of the nation. The fact is, that for\r\n    the last four years the annuities have not been paid at all.\r\n\r\n    The distribution in this new way was impracticable, if the\r\n    Cherokees had been willing thus to receive it, but they were not\r\n    willing; they have refused and the annuities have remained unpaid.\r\n    Your memorialists forbear to advert to the motives of such conduct,\r\n    leaving them to be considered and appreciated by Congress. All they\r\n    will say is, that it has coincided with other measures adopted\r\n    to reduce them to poverty and despair and to extort from their\r\n    wretchedness a concession of their guaranteed rights. Having failed\r\n    in their efforts to obtain relief elsewhere, your memorialists\r\n    now appeal to Congress, and respectfully pray that your honorable\r\n    bodies will look into their whole case, and that such measures may\r\n    be adopted as will give them redress and security.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY NEGOTIATIONS RESUMED.\r\n\r\n_Rival delegations headed by Ross and Ridge._--But little else was\r\ndone and practically nothing was accomplished until the following\r\nwinter. Early in February, 1835, two rival delegations, each claiming\r\nto represent the Cherokee Nation, arrived in Washington. One was\r\nheaded by John Ross, who had long been the principal chief and who\r\nwas the most intelligent and influential man in the nation. The rival\r\ndelegation was led by John Ridge, who had been a subchief and a man of\r\nsome considerable influence among his people.[404] The Ross delegation\r\nhad been consistently and bitterly opposed to any negotiations having\r\nin view the surrender of their territory and a removal west of the\r\nMississippi. Ridge and his delegation, though formerly of the same mind\r\nwith Ross, had begun to perceive the futility of further opposition\r\nto the demands of the State and national authorities. Feeling the\r\ncertainty that the approaching crisis in Cherokee affairs could have\r\nbut one result, and perceiving an opportunity to enhance his own\r\nimportance and to secure the discomfiture of his hitherto more powerful\r\nrival, Ridge caused it to be intimated to the United States authorities\r\nthat he and his delegation were prepared to treat with them upon the\r\nbasis previously laid down by President Jackson of a cession of their\r\nterritory and a removal west.\r\n\r\nRev. J. F. Schermerhorn was therefore appointed,[405] and instructions\r\nwere prepared authorizing him to meet Ridge and his party and to\r\nascertain on what terms an amicable and satisfactory arrangement could\r\nbe made. After the instructions had been delivered to Mr. Schermerhorn,\r\nbut before he had commenced the negotiation, Ross and his party\r\nrequested to be allowed to make a proposal to be submitted to the\r\nPresident for his approval. He was assured that his proposal would be\r\nconsidered, and in the mean time Mr. Schermerhorn was requested to\r\nsuspend his operations. So much time, however, elapsed before anything\r\nmore was heard from Ross and his party that the negotiations with\r\nthe Ridge party were proceeded with. They terminated in a general\r\nunderstanding respecting the basis of an arrangement, leaving, however,\r\nmany of the details to be filled up. The total amount of the various\r\nstipulations provided for, as a full consideration for the cession\r\nof their lands, was $3,250,000, besides the sum of $150,000 for\r\ndepredation claims. In addition, a tract of 800,000 acres of land west\r\nof the Mississippi was to be added to the territory already promised\r\nthem, amounting in the aggregate, including the western outlet, to\r\nabout 13,800,000 acres.[406]\r\n\r\n_Proposition of John Ross._--On the 25th of February, Ross and his\r\ndelegation, finding that the negotiations with Ridge were proceeding,\r\nsubmitted a proposition for removal based upon an allowance of\r\n$20,000,000 for the cession of the territory and the payment of a\r\nclass of claims of uncertain number and value. This was considered\r\nso unreasonable as to render the seriousness of his proposition\r\ndoubtful at the time, but it was finally modified by an assertion of\r\nhis willingness to accept such sum as the Senate of the United States\r\nshould declare to be just and proper.[407] Thereupon a statement of\r\nall the facts was placed in the hands of Senator King, of Georgia, who\r\nsubmitted the same to the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs on the 2d\r\nof March. It was not contemplated that any arrangement made with these\r\nCherokee delegations at this time should be definitive, but that the\r\nCherokee people should be assembled for the purpose of considering the\r\nsubject, and their assent asked to such propositions as they might deem\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\n_Resolution of United States Senate on John Ross's proposition._--The\r\nSenate gave the matter prompt consideration, and on the 6th of March\r\nthe Secretary of War advised Mr. Ross that by a resolution they had\r\nstated their opinion that \"a sum not exceeding $5,000,000 should be\r\npaid to the Cherokee Indians for all their lands and possessions\r\neast of the Mississippi River,\" and he was invited to enter into\r\nnegotiations upon that basis, but declined to do so.\r\n\r\n_Preliminary treaty concluded with the Ridge party._--The treaty\r\nbetween Schermerhorn and the Ridge party was thereupon completed with\r\nsome modifications and duly signed on the 14th of March, but with the\r\nexpress stipulation that it should receive the approval of the Cherokee\r\npeople in full council assembled before being considered of any binding\r\nforce. The consideration was changed to read $4,500,000 and 800,000\r\nacres of additional land, but in the main its provisions differed\r\nbut little in the important objects sought to be secured from those\r\ncontained in the treaty as finally concluded, December 29, 1835.\r\n\r\n_Schermerhorn and Carroll appointed to complete the treaty._--In the\r\nmean time,[408] two days after the conclusion of the preliminary Ridge\r\ntreaty, President Jackson issued an address to the Cherokees, inviting\r\nthem to a calm consideration of their condition and prospects, and\r\nurging upon them the benefits certain to inure to their nation by the\r\nratification of the treaty just concluded and their removal to the\r\nwestern country. This address was intrusted to Rev. J. F. Schermerhorn\r\nand General William Carroll, whom the President had appointed on the\r\n2d of April as commissioners to complete in the Cherokee country the\r\nnegotiation of the treaty.\r\n\r\nGeneral Carroll being unable on account of ill-health to proceed from\r\nNashville to the Cherokee Nation, Mr. Schermerhorn was compelled to\r\nassume the responsibilities of the negotiation alone. The entire\r\nsummer and fall were spent in endeavors to reconcile differences of\r\nopinion, to adjust feuds among the different factions of the tribe,\r\nand to secure some definitive and consolidated action. Meeting with\r\nno substantial encouragement, he suggested, in a communication to the\r\nSecretary of War,[409] two alternative propositions, by either of which\r\na treaty might be secured.\r\n\r\nThese propositions were: (1) That the appraising agents of the\r\nGovernment should ascertain from influential Cherokees their own\r\nopinion of the value of their improvements, and promise them the\r\namount, if this estimate should be in any degree reasonable, and if\r\nthey would take a decided stand in favor of the treaty and conclude\r\nthe same. (2) To conclude the treaty with a portion of the nation\r\nonly, should one with the whole be found impracticable, and compel the\r\nacquiescence of the remainder in its provisions.\r\n\r\nHe was at once[410] advised of the opposition of the President to\r\nany such action. If a treaty could not be concluded upon fair and\r\nopen terms, he must abandon the effort and leave the nation to the\r\nconsequences of its own stubbornness. He must make no particular\r\npromise to any individual, high or low, to gain his co-operation. The\r\ninterest of the whole must not be sacrificed to the cupidity of a few,\r\nand if a treaty was concluded at all it must be one that would stand\r\nthe test of the most rigid scrutiny.\r\n\r\n_The Ridge treaty rejected._--The Cherokee people in full council at\r\nRed Clay, in the following October, rejected the Ridge treaty. Mr. John\r\nRidge and Elias Boudinot, who had been the main stay and support of Mr.\r\nSchermerhorn in the preceding negotiations, at this council, through\r\nfear or duplicity and unexpectedly to him, abandoned their support of\r\nhis measures and coincided with the preponderance of Cherokee sentiment\r\non the subject. In his report of this failure to bring the negotiations\r\nto a successful termination Commissioner Schermerhorn says: \"I have\r\npressed Ross so hard by the course I have adopted that although he got\r\nthe general council to pass a resolution declaring that they would not\r\ntreat on the basis of the $5,000,000, yet he has been forced to bring\r\nthe nation to agree to a treaty, here or at Washington. They have used\r\nevery effort to get by me and get to Washington again this winter.\r\nThey dare not yet do it. You will perceive Ridge and his friends have\r\ntaken apparently a strange course. I believe he began to be discouraged\r\nin contending with the power of Ross; and perhaps also considerations\r\nof personal safety have had their influence, but the Lord is able to\r\noverrule all things for good.\"[411]\r\n\r\n_Council at New Echota._--During the session of this council notice was\r\ngiven to the Cherokees to meet the United States commissioners on the\r\nthird Monday in December following, at New Echota, for the purpose\r\nof negotiating and agreeing upon the terms of a treaty. The notice\r\nwas also printed in Cherokee and circulated throughout the nation,\r\ninforming the Indians that those who did not attend would be counted\r\nas assenting to any treaty that might be made.[412] In the mean time\r\nthe Ross delegation, authorized by the Red Clay council to conclude a\r\ntreaty either there or at Washington, finding that Schermerhorn had\r\nno authority to treat on any other basis than the one rejected by\r\nthe nation, proceeded, according to their people's instructions, to\r\nWashington. Previous to their departure, John Ross was arrested. This\r\ntook place immediately upon the breaking up of the council. He was\r\ndetained some time under the surveillance of a strong guard, without\r\nany charge against him, and ultimately released without any apology or\r\nexplanation. At this arrest all his papers were seized, including as\r\nwell all his private correspondence and the proceedings of the Cherokee\r\ncouncil.[413] In accordance with the call for a council at New Echota\r\nthe Indians assembled at the appointed time and place, to the number\r\nof only three to five hundred, as reported[414] by Mr. Schermerhorn\r\nhimself, who could hardly be accused of any tendency to underestimate\r\nthe gathering. That gentleman opened the council December 22, 1835,\r\nin the absence of Governor Carroll, whose health was still such as\r\nto prevent his attendance. The objects of the council were fully\r\nexplained, the small attendance being attributed to the influence of\r\nJohn Ross. It was also suggested by those unfriendly to the proposed\r\ntreaty as a good reason for the absence of so large a proportion of the\r\nnation, that the right to convene a national council was vested in the\r\nprincipal chief, and they were unaware that that officer's authority\r\nhad been delegated to Mr. Schermerhorn.[413]\r\n\r\nThose present resolved on the 23d to enter into negotiations and\r\nappointed a committee of twenty to arrange the details with the\r\nCommissioner and to report the result to the whole council.\r\n\r\nThe following five days were occupied by the commissioner and\r\nthe committee in discussing and agreeing upon the details of the\r\ntreaty, one point of difference being as to whether the $5,000,000\r\nconsideration for their lands as mentioned in the resolution of\r\nthe Senate was meant to include the damages to individual property\r\nsustained at the hands of white trespassers.\r\n\r\nThe Indians insisted that $300,000 additional should be allowed for\r\nthat purpose, but it was finally agreed that the treaty should not be\r\npresented to the Senate without the consent of their delegation until\r\nthey were satisfied the Senate had not included these claims in the\r\nsum named in the resolution of that body. It was also insisted by the\r\nCherokee committee that reservations should be made to such of their\r\npeople as desired to remain in their homes and become citizens of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nAs a compromise of this demand, it was agreed by the United States\r\ncommissioner to allow pre-emptions of 160 acres each, not exceeding 400\r\nin number, in the States of North Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama, to\r\nsuch heads of Cherokee families only as were qualified to become useful\r\nmembers of society. None were to be entitled to this privilege unless\r\ntheir applications were recommended by a committee of their own people\r\n(a majority of which committee should be composed of those members of\r\nthe tribe who were themselves enrolled for removal) and approved by\r\nthe United States commissioners. The latter also proposed to make the\r\nreservations dependent upon the approval of the legislatures of the\r\nStates within which they might be respectively located, but to this\r\nproposition a strenuous objection was offered by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThe articles as agreed upon were reported by the Cherokee committee to\r\ntheir people, and were approved, transcribed, and signed on the 29th.\r\n\r\nThe council adjourned on the 30th, after designating a committee to\r\nproceed to Washington and urge the ratification of the treaty, clothed\r\nwith power to assent to any alterations made necessary by the action of\r\nthe President or Senate.[415]\r\n\r\n_Commissioner Schermerhorn reports conclusion of a\r\ntreaty._--Immediately following the adjournment of the council,\r\nCommissioner Schermerhorn wrote the Secretary of War, saying: \"I have\r\nthe extreme pleasure to announce to you that yesterday I concluded a\r\ntreaty. * * * Ross after this treaty is prostrate. The power of the\r\nnation is taken from him, as well as the money, and the treaty will\r\ngive general satisfaction.\"[416]\r\n\r\n_Supplemental treaty concluded._--Several provisions of the treaty\r\nmet with the disapproval of the President, in order to meet which\r\nsupplementary articles of agreement were concluded under date of March\r\n1, 1836,[417] wherein it was stipulated that all pre-emption rights\r\nprovided for should be declared void; also that, in lieu of the same\r\nand to cover expenses of removal and payment of claims against citizens\r\nof the United States, the sum of $600,000 should be allowed them in\r\naddition to the five millions allowed for cession of territory. And,\r\nfurthermore, that the $100,000 stipulated to be expended for the poorer\r\nclass of Cherokees who should remove west should be placed to the\r\ncredit of the general national fund.[418]\r\n\r\n_Opposition of the Ross party._--Whilst these events were happening,\r\nand strenuous efforts were being made to encourage among Senators a\r\nsentiment favorable to the ratification of the treaty, John Ross was\r\nmanifesting his usual zeal and activity in the opposite direction.\r\nEarly in the spring of 1836 he made his appearance in Washington,\r\naccompanied by a delegation, and presented two protests against the\r\nratification of the treaty, one purporting to have been signed by\r\nCherokees residing within the limits of North Carolina to the number\r\nof 3,250, and the other representing the alleged sentiments of 12,714\r\npersons residing within the main body of the nation. Mr. Ross also\r\ndemanded the payment of the long withheld annuities to himself as\r\nthe duly authorized representative of the nation, which was declined\r\nunless special direction to that effect should be given by an authentic\r\nvote of the tribe from year to year. He was further assured that the\r\nPresident had ceased to recognize any existing government among the\r\nEastern Cherokees.[419]\r\n\r\n_Treaty ratified by United States Senate._--In spite of the opposition\r\nof Mr. Ross and his party, the treaty was assented to by the Senate by\r\none more than the necessary two-thirds majority,[420] and was ratified\r\nand proclaimed by the President on the 23d of May, 1836.[421] By its\r\nterms two years were allowed within which the nation must remove west\r\nof the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n_Measures for execution of the treaty._--Preparatory steps were\r\npromptly taken for carrying the treaty into execution. On the 7th of\r\nJune Gov. Wilson Lumpkin, of Georgia, and Gov. William Carroll, of\r\nTennessee, were designated as commissioners under the 17th article,\r\nand vested with general supervisory authority over the execution of\r\nthe treaty. The selection and general supervision (under the foregoing\r\ncommissioners) of the agents to appraise the value of Cherokee\r\nimprovements was placed in charge of Benjamin F. Curry, to whom\r\ndetailed instructions were given[422] for his guidance. General John\r\nE. Wool was placed in command of the United States troops within the\r\nCherokee Nation, but with instructions[423] that military force should\r\nonly be applied in the event of hostilities being commenced by the\r\nCherokees.\r\n\r\n_The Ross party refuse to acquiesce._--John Ross and his delegation,\r\nhaving returned home, at once proceeded to enter upon a vigorous\r\ncampaign of opposition to the execution of the treaty. He used every\r\nmeans to incite the animosity of his people against Ridge and his\r\nfriends, who had been instrumental in bringing it about and who were\r\nfavorable to removal. Councils were held and resolutions were adopted\r\ndenouncing in the severest terms the motives and action of the United\r\nStates authorities and declaring the treaty in all its provisions\r\nabsolutely null and void.[424] A copy of these resolutions having\r\nbeen transmitted to the Secretary of War by General Wool, the former\r\nwas directed[425] by the President to express his astonishment that\r\nan officer of the Army should have received or transmitted a paper so\r\ndisrespectful to the Executive, to the Senate, and through them to\r\nthe people of the United States. To prevent any misapprehension on\r\nthe subject of the treaty the Secretary was instructed to repeat in\r\nthe most explicit terms the settled determination of the President\r\nthat it should be executed without modification and with all the\r\ndispatch consistent with propriety and justice. Furthermore, that after\r\ndelivering a copy of this letter to Mr. Ross no further communication\r\nshould be held with him either orally or in writing in regard to the\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nTo give a clearer idea of the actual state of feeling that pervaded the\r\nCherokee Nation on the subject of removal, as well as the character\r\nof the methods that distinguished the negotiators on the part of the\r\nUnited States, a few quotations from the letters and reports of those\r\nin a position to observe the passing events may not be inappropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF MAJOR DAVIS.\r\n\r\nMaj. William M. Davis had been appointed an agent by the Secretary of\r\nWar for the enrollment of Cherokees desirous of removal to the West and\r\nfor the appraisement of the value of their improvements. He had gone\r\namong the Cherokees for this specific purpose. He held his appointment\r\nby the grace and permission of the President. It was natural that\r\nhis desire should be strongly in the line of securing the Executive\r\napproval of his labors.\r\n\r\nStrong, however, as was that desire he was unable to bring himself to\r\nthe support of the methods that were being pursued in the negotiation\r\nof the proposed treaty. On the 5th of March following the conclusion of\r\nthe treaty of 1835, he wrote the Secretary of War thus:\r\n\r\n    I conceive that my duty to the President, to yourself, and to\r\n    my country, reluctantly compels me to make a statement of facts in\r\n    relation to a meeting of a small number of Cherokees at New Echota\r\n    last December, who were met by Mr. Schermerhorn and articles of a\r\n    general treaty entered into between them for the whole Cherokee\r\n    Nation.\r\n\r\n    * * * I should not interpose in the matter at all but I\r\n    discover that you do not receive impartial information on the\r\n    subject; that you have to depend upon the _ex parte_, partial, and\r\n    interested reports of a person who will not give you the truth.\r\n    I will not be silent when I see that you are about to be imposed\r\n    on by a gross and base betrayal of the high trust reposed in Rev.\r\n    J. F. Schermerhorn by you. His conduct and course of policy was a\r\n    series of blunders from first to last. * * * It has been wholly of\r\n    a partisan character.\r\n\r\n    Sir, that paper * * * called a treaty is no treaty at all,\r\n    because not sanctioned by the great body of the Cherokees and\r\n    made without their participation or assent. I solemnly declare\r\n    to you that upon its reference to the Cherokee people it would\r\n    be instantly rejected by nine-tenths of them and I believe by\r\n    nineteen-twentieths of them. There were not present at the\r\n    conclusion of the treaty more than one hundred Cherokee voters,\r\n    and not more than three hundred, including women and children,\r\n    although the weather was everything that could be desired. The\r\n    Indians had long been notified of the meeting, and blankets were\r\n    promised to all who would come and vote for the treaty. The most\r\n    cunning and artful means were resorted to to conceal the paucity\r\n    of numbers present at the treaty. No enumeration of them was made\r\n    by Schermerhorn. The business of making the treaty was transacted\r\n    with a committee appointed by the Indians present, so as not\r\n    to expose their numbers. The power of attorney under which the\r\n    committee acted was signed only by the president and secretary\r\n    of the meeting, so as not to disclose their weakness. * * * Mr.\r\n    Schermerhorn's apparent design was to conceal the real number\r\n    present and to impose on the public and the Government upon this\r\n    point. The delegation taken to Washington by Mr. Schermerhorn had\r\n    no more authority to make a treaty than any other dozen Cherokees\r\n    accidentally picked up for that purpose. I now warn you and the\r\n    President that if this paper of Schermerhorn's called a treaty\r\n    is sent to the Senate and ratified you will bring trouble upon\r\n    the Government and eventually destroy this (the Cherokee) nation.\r\n    The Cherokees are a peaceable, harmless people, but you may drive\r\n    them to desperation, and this treaty cannot be carried into effect\r\n    except by the strong arm of force.[426]\r\n\r\n\r\nELIAS BOUDINOT'S VIEWS.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there also appeared, in justification of the treaty and\r\nof his own action in signing it, a pamphlet address issued by Elias\r\nBoudinot of the Cherokee Nation. Mr. Boudinot was one of the ablest and\r\nmost cultured of his people, and had long been the editor and publisher\r\nof a newspaper in the nation, printed both in English and Cherokee. The\r\nsubstance of his argument in vindication of the treaty may have been\r\ncreditable from the standpoint of policy and a regard for the future\r\nwelfare of his people, but in the abstract it is a dangerous doctrine.\r\nHe said:\r\n\r\n    We cannot conceive of the acts of a minority to be so\r\n    reprehensible and unjust as are represented by Mr. Ross. If one\r\n    hundred persons are ignorant of their true situation and are so\r\n    completely blinded as not to see the destruction that awaits them,\r\n    we can see strong reasons to justify the action of a minority of\r\n    fifty persons to do what the majority would do if they understood\r\n    their condition, to save a nation from political thralldom and\r\n    moral degradation.[427]\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH OF GENERAL R. G. DUNLAP.\r\n\r\nIt having been extensively rumored, during the few months immediately\r\nsucceeding the conclusion of the treaty, that John Ross and other evil\r\ndisposed persons were seeking to incite the Cherokees to outbreak and\r\nbloodshed, the militia of the surrounding States were called into\r\nservice for the protection of life and property from the supposed\r\nexisting dangers. Brig. Gen. R. G. Dunlap commanded the East Tennessee\r\nvolunteers. In a speech to his brigade at their disbandment in\r\nSeptember, 1836, he used the following language:\r\n\r\n    I forthwith visited all the posts within the first three States\r\n    and gave the Cherokees (the whites needed none) all the protection\r\n    in my power. * * * My course has excited the hatred of a few of\r\n    the lawless rabble in Georgia, who have long played the part of\r\n    unfeeling petty tyrants, and that to the disgrace of the proud\r\n    character of gallant soldiers and good citizens. I had determined\r\n    that I would never dishonor the Tennessee arms in a servile service\r\n    by aiding to carry into execution at the point of the bayonet a\r\n    treaty made by a lean minority against the will and authority of\r\n    the Cherokee people. * * * I soon discovered that the Indians\r\n    had not the most distant thought of war with the United States,\r\n    notwithstanding the common rights of humanity and justice had been\r\n    denied them.[428]\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF GENERAL JOHN E. WOOL.\r\n\r\nAgain, February 18, 1837, General John E. Wool, of the United States\r\nArmy, who had been ordered to the command of the troops that were being\r\nconcentrated in the Cherokee country \"to look down opposition\" to the\r\nenforcement of the treaty, wrote Adjutant-General Jones, at Washington,\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n    \"I called them (the Cherokees) together and made a short speech.\r\n    It is, however, vain to talk to a people almost universally opposed\r\n    to the treaty and who maintain that they never made such a treaty.\r\n    So determined are they in their opposition that not one of all\r\n    those who were present and voted at the council held but a day or\r\n    two since, however poor or destitute, would receive either rations\r\n    or clothing from the United States lest they might compromise\r\n    themselves in regard to the treaty. These same people, as well\r\n    as those in the mountains of North Carolina, during the summer\r\n    past, preferred living upon the roots and sap of trees rather than\r\n    receive provisions from the United States, and thousands, as I have\r\n    been informed, had no other food for weeks.\"\r\n\r\nFour months later,[429] General Wool again, in the course of a letter\r\nto the Secretary of War concerning the death of Major Curry, who had\r\nbeen a prominent factor in promoting the conclusion of the treaty of\r\n1835, said that--\r\n\r\n    Had Curry lived he would assuredly have been killed by the\r\n    Indians. It is a truth that you have not a single agent, high or\r\n    low, that has the slightest moral control over the Indians. It\r\n    would be wise if persons appointed to civil stations in the nation\r\n    could be taken from among those who have had nothing to do with\r\n    making the late treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nREPORT OF JOHN MASON, JR.\r\n\r\nIn further testimony concerning the situation of affairs in the\r\nCherokee Nation at this period, may be cited the report of John Mason,\r\nJr., who was in the summer of 1837[430] sent as the confidential\r\nagent of the War Department to make observations and report. In the\r\nautumn[431] of that year he reported that--\r\n\r\n    The chiefs and better informed part of the nation are convinced\r\n    that they cannot retain the country. But the opposition to the\r\n    treaty is unanimous and irreconcilable. They say it cannot bind\r\n    them because they did not make it; that it was made by a few\r\n    unauthorized individuals; that the nation is not a party to it. *\r\n    * * They retain the forms of their government in their proceedings\r\n    among themselves, though they have had no election since 1830; the\r\n    chiefs and headmen then in power having been authorized to act\r\n    until their government shall again be regularly constituted. Under\r\n    this arrangement John Ross retains the post of principal chief. *\r\n    * * The influence of this chief is unbounded and unquestioned. The\r\n    whole nation of eighteen thousand persons is with him, the few,\r\n    about three hundred, who made the treaty having left the country.\r\n    It is evident, therefore, that Ross and his party are in fact the\r\n    Cherokee Nation. * * * Many who were opposed to the treaty have\r\n    emigrated to secure the rations, or because of fear of an outbreak.\r\n    * * * The officers say that, with all his power, Ross cannot, if\r\n    he would, change the course he has heretofore pursued and to which\r\n    he is held by the fixed determination of his people. He dislikes\r\n    being seen in conversation with white men, and particularly with\r\n    agents of the Government. Were he, as matters now stand, to advise\r\n    the Indians to acknowledge the treaty, he would at once forfeit\r\n    their confidence and probably his life. Yet though unwavering in\r\n    his opposition to the treaty, Ross's influence has constantly been\r\n    exerted to preserve the peace of the country, and Colonel Lindsay\r\n    says that he (Ross) alone stands at this time between the whites\r\n    and bloodshed. The opposition to the treaty on the part of the\r\n    Indians is unanimous and sincere, and it is not a mere political\r\n    game played by Ross for the maintenance of his ascendancy in the\r\n    tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nHENRY CLAY'S SYMPATHY WITH THE CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting in this connection, as indicating the strong and\r\nwidespread public feeling manifested in the Cherokee question, to note\r\nthat it became in some sense a test question among leaders of the two\r\ngreat political parties. The Democrats strenuously upheld the conduct\r\nof President Jackson on the subject, and the Whigs assailed him with\r\nextreme bitterness. The great Whig leader, Henry Clay, in replying[432]\r\nto a letter received by him from John Gunter, a Cherokee, took occasion\r\nto express his sympathy with the Cherokee people for the wrongs and\r\nsufferings experienced by them. He regretted them not only because\r\nof their injustice, but because they inflicted a deep wound on the\r\ncharacter of the American Republic. He supposed that the principles\r\nwhich had uniformly governed our relations with the Indian nations had\r\nbeen too long and too firmly established to be disturbed. They had been\r\nproclaimed in the negotiation with Great Britain by the commissioners\r\nwho concluded the treaty of peace, of whom he was one, and any\r\nviolation of them by the United States he felt with sensibility. By\r\nthose principles the Cherokee Nation had a right to establish its own\r\nform of government, to alter and amend it at pleasure, to live under\r\nits own laws, to be exempt from the United States laws or the laws of\r\nany individual State, and to claim the protection of the United States.\r\nHe considered that the Chief Magistrate and his subordinates had acted\r\nin direct hostility to those principles and had thereby encouraged\r\nGeorgia to usurp powers of legislation over the Cherokee Nation which\r\nshe did not of right possess.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLICY OF THE PRESIDENT CRITICISED--SPEECH OF COL. DAVID CROCKETT.\r\n\r\nAmong many men of note who denounced in most vigorous terms the policy\r\nof the Administration toward the Cherokees were Daniel Webster and\r\nEdward Everett, of Massachusetts; Theodore Frelinghuysen, of New\r\nJersey; Peleg Sprague, of Maine; Henry R. Storrs, of New York; Henry\r\nA. Wise, of Virginia; and David Crockett, of Tennessee. The latter, in\r\na speech in the House of Representatives, denounced the treatment to\r\nwhich the Indians had been subjected at the hands of the Government as\r\nunjust, dishonest, cruel, and short-sighted in the extreme. He alluded\r\nto the fact that he represented a district which bordered on the domain\r\nof the southern tribes, and that his constituents were perhaps as\r\nimmediately interested in the removal of the Indians as those of any\r\nother member of the House. His voice would perhaps not be seconded by\r\nthat of a single fellow member living within 500 miles of his home. He\r\nhad been threatened that if he did not support the policy of forcible\r\nremoval his public career would be summarily cut off. But while he was\r\nperhaps as desirous of pleasing his constituents and of coinciding\r\nwith the wishes of his colleagues as any man in Congress, he could not\r\npermit himself to do so at the expense of his honor and conscience in\r\nthe support of such a measure. He believed the American people could be\r\nrelied on to approve their Representatives for daring, in the face of\r\nall opposition, to perform their conscientious duty, but if not, the\r\napproval of his own conscience was dearer to him than all else.\r\n\r\nGovernor Lumpkin, immediately upon his appointment as commissioner, had\r\nrepaired to the Cherokee country, but Governor Carroll, owing to some\r\npending negotiations with the Choctaws and subsequently to ill health,\r\nwas unable to assume the duties assigned him. He was succeeded[433]\r\nby John Kennedy. To this commission a third member was added in the\r\nsummer of 1837[434] in the person of Colonel Guild, who was found to\r\nbe ineligible, however, by reason of being a member of the Tennessee\r\nlegislature. His place was supplied by the appointment[435] of James W.\r\nGwin, of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nOn the 22d of December James Liddell was also appointed, _vice_\r\nGovernor Lumpkin resigned.[436]\r\n\r\nSuperintendent Currey having died, General Nathan Smith was\r\nappointed[437] to succeed him as superintendent of emigration.\r\n\r\n_Census of Cherokee Nation._--It appears from a statement about this\r\ntime,[438] made by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, that from a\r\ncensus of the Cherokees, taken in the year 1835, the number residing\r\nin the States of Georgia, North Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee\r\nwas 16,542, exclusive of slaves and of whites intermarried with\r\nCherokees.[439]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1837,[440] General Wool was relieved from command at his own\r\nrequest, and his successor, Col. William Lindsay, was instructed to\r\narrest John Ross and turn him over to the civil authorities in case he\r\ndid anything further calculated to excite a spirit of hostility among\r\nthe Cherokees on the subject of removal. This threat, however, seemed\r\nto have little effect, for we find Mr. Ross presiding over a general\r\ncouncil, convened at his instigation, on the 31st of July, to attend\r\nwhich the Government hastily dispatched Mr. John Mason, Jr., with\r\ninstructions to traverse and correct any misstatements of the position\r\nof the United States authorities that might be set forth by Ross and\r\nhis followers. An extract from Mr. Mason's report has already been\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n_Cherokee memorial in Congress._--Again, in the spring of 1838 Ross\r\nlaid before Congress a protest and memorial for the redress of\r\ngrievances, which, in the Senate, was laid upon the table[441] by a\r\nvote of 36 to 10, and a memorial from citizens of New York involving an\r\ninquiry into the validity of the treaty of 1835 shared a similar fate\r\nin the House of Representatives two days later by a vote of 102 to 75.\r\n\r\n_Speech of Henry A. Wise._--The discussion of these memorials in\r\nCongress took a wide range and excited the warmest interest, not\r\nonly in that body, but throughout the country. The speeches were\r\ncharacterized by a depth and bitterness of feeling such as had never\r\nbeen exceeded even on the slavery question. Hon. Henry A. Wise, of\r\nVirginia, who was then a member of the House of Representatives from\r\nthat State, was especially earnest in his denunciation of the treaty\r\nof 1835 and of the administration that had concluded it. He looked\r\nupon it as null and void. In order to make treaties binding the assent\r\nof both parties must be obtained, and he would assert without fear of\r\ncontradiction that there was not one man in that House or out of it\r\nwho had read the proceedings in the case who would say that there had\r\never been any assent given to that treaty by the Cherokee Nation. If\r\nthis were the proper time he could go further and show that Georgia\r\nhad done her part, too, in this oppression. He could show this by\r\nproving the policy of that State in relation to the Indians and the\r\ninstitutions of the General Government. That was the only State in the\r\nUnion that had ever actually nullified, and she now tells you that if\r\nthe United States should undertake to naturalize any portion of the\r\nIndian tribes within her limits as citizens of the United States she\r\nwould do so again. He had not disparaged the surrounding people of\r\nGeorgia, far from it--\"but\" (said he) \"there are proofs around us in\r\nthis city of the high advancement in civilization which characterizes\r\nthe Cherokees.\" He would tell the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Halsey)\r\nthat a statesman of his own State, who occupied a high and honorable\r\npost in this Government, would not gain greatly by a comparison, either\r\nin civilization or morals, with a Cherokee chief whom he could name. He\r\nwould fearlessly institute such a comparison between John Ross and John\r\nForsyth.[442]\r\n\r\n_Speech of Daniel Webster._--Mr. Webster, of Massachusetts, also took\r\noccasion[443] to remark in the Senate that \"there is a strong and\r\ngrowing feeling in the country that great wrong has been done to the\r\nCherokees by the treaty of New Echota.\"\r\n\r\n_President Van Buren proffers a compromise._--Public feeling became so\r\ndeeply stirred on the subject that, in the interests of a compromise,\r\nPresident Van Buren, in May, 1838, formulated a proposition to allow\r\nthe Cherokees two years further time in which to remove, subject to the\r\napproval of Congress and the executives of the States interested.\r\n\r\n_Georgia hostile to the compromise._--To the communication addressed to\r\nGovernor Gilmer, of Georgia, on the subject, he responded:\r\n\r\n    * * * I can give it no sanction whatever. The proposal could\r\n    not be carried into effect but in violation of the rights of\r\n    this State. * * * It is necessary that I should know whether the\r\n    President intends by the instructions to General Scott to require\r\n    that the Indians shall be maintained in their occupancy by an armed\r\n    force in opposition to the rights of the owners of the soil. If\r\n    such be the intention, a direct collision between the authorities\r\n    of the State and the General Government must ensue. My duty will\r\n    require that I shall prevent any interference whatever by the\r\n    troops with the rights of the State and its citizens. I shall not\r\n    fail to perform it.\r\n\r\nThis called forth a hurried explanation from the Secretary of War\r\nthat the instructions to General Scott were not intended to bear the\r\nconstruction placed upon them by the executive of Georgia, but, on the\r\ncontrary, it was the desire and the determination of the President to\r\nsecure the removal of the Cherokees at the earliest day practicable,\r\nand he made no doubt it could be effected the present season.[444]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SCOTT ORDERED TO COMMAND TROOPS IN THE CHEROKEE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nThe executive machinery under the treaty had in the mean time been\r\nplaced in operation, and at the beginning of the year 1838, 2,103\r\nCherokees had been removed, of whom 1,282 had been permitted to remove\r\nthemselves.[445]\r\n\r\nIntelligence having reached the President, however, causing\r\napprehension that the mass of the nation did not intend to remove as\r\nrequired by the treaty General Winfield Scott was ordered[446] to\r\nassume command of the troops already in the nation, and to collect an\r\nincreased force, comprising a regiment of artillery, a regiment of\r\ninfantry, and six companies of dragoons. He was further authorized,\r\nif deemed necessary, to call upon the governors of Tennessee, North\r\nCarolina, Georgia, and Alabama for militia and volunteers, not\r\nexceeding four thousand in number, and to put the Indians in motion for\r\nthe West at the earliest moment possible, following the expiration of\r\nthe two years specified in the treaty.\r\n\r\n_Proclamation of General Scott._--On reaching the scene of operations\r\nGeneral Scott issued[447] a proclamation to the Cherokees in which he\r\nannounced that--\r\n\r\n    The President of the United States has sent me with a powerful\r\n    army to cause you, in obedience to the treaty of 1835, to join\r\n    that part of your people who are already established in prosperity\r\n    on the other side of the Mississippi. Unhappily the two years *\r\n    * * allowed for that purpose you have suffered to pass away * *\r\n    * without making any preparation to follow, and now * * * the\r\n    emigration must be commenced in haste. * * * The full moon of May\r\n    is already on the wane, and before another shall have passed away\r\n    every Cherokee, man, woman, and child * * * must be in motion\r\n    to join their brethren in the far West. * * * This is no sudden\r\n    determination on the part of the President. * * * I have come\r\n    to carry out that determination. My troops already occupy many\r\n    positions, * * * and thousands and thousands are approaching from\r\n    every quarter to render resistance and escape alike hopeless. * * *\r\n    Will you then by resistance compel us to resort to arms? * * * Or\r\n    will you by flight seek to hide yourselves in mountains and forests\r\n    and thus oblige us to hunt you down? Remember that in pursuit it\r\n    may be impossible to avoid conflicts. The blood of the white man\r\n    or the blood of the red man may be spilt, and if spilt, however\r\n    accidentally, it may be impossible for the discreet and humane\r\n    among you, or among us, to prevent a general war and carnage.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ROSS PROPOSES A NEW TREATY.\r\n\r\nJohn Ross, finding no sign of wavering in the determination of the\r\nPresident to promptly execute the treaty, then submitted[448] a project\r\nfor the negotiation of a new treaty as a substitute for that of 1835,\r\nand differing but little from it in its proposed provisions, except in\r\nthe idea of securing a somewhat larger consideration, as well as some\r\nminor advantages. He was assured in reply that while the United States\r\nwere willing to extend every liberality of construction to the terms\r\nof the treaty of 1835 and to secure the Cherokee title to the western\r\ncountry by patent, they could not entertain the idea of a new treaty.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it became absolutely apparent, not only that the Cherokees\r\nmust go but that no unnecessary delay would be tolerated beyond the\r\nlimit fixed by the treaty, a more submissive spirit began to be\r\nmanifested among them. During the summer of 1838 several parties of\r\nemigrants were dispatched under the direction of officers of the Army.\r\nThe number thus removed aggregated about 6,000.[449]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEES PERMITTED TO REMOVE THEMSELVES.\r\n\r\nLater in the season John Ross and others, by virtue of a resolution of\r\nthe national council, submitted a proposition to General Scott that\r\nthe remainder of the business of emigration should be confided to the\r\nnation, and should take place in the following September and October,\r\nafter the close of the sickly season, the estimated cost of such\r\nremoval to be fixed at $65.88 per head. To this proposal assent was\r\ngiven,[450] and the last party of Cherokee emigrants began their march\r\nfor the West on the 4th of December, 1838.[451] Scattered through the\r\nmountains of North Carolina and Tennessee, however, were many who had\r\nfled to avoid removal, and who, nearly a year later, were represented\r\nto number 1,046,[452] and Mr. James Murray was, in the spring of 1840,\r\nappointed[453] a commissioner to ascertain and enroll for removal those\r\nentitled to the benefits of the treaty of 1835.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISSENSIONS AMONG CHEROKEES IN THEIR NEW HOME.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the Cherokees having at last been accomplished, the\r\nnext important object of the Government was to insure their internal\r\ntranquillity, with a view to the increase and encouragement of those\r\nhabits of industry, thrift, and respect for lawfully constituted\r\nauthority which had made so much progress among them in their\r\neastern home. But this was an undertaking of much difficulty. The\r\ninstrumentalities used by the Government in securing the conclusion and\r\napproval of not only the treaty of 1835 but also those of 1817 and 1819\r\nhad caused much division and bitterness in their ranks, which had on\r\nmany occasions in the past cropped out in acts of injustice and even\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nUpon the coming together of the body of the nation in their new country\r\nwest of the Mississippi, they found themselves torn and distracted by\r\nparty dissensions and bitterness almost beyond hope of reconciliation.\r\nThe parties were respectively denominated:\r\n\r\n1. The \"Old Settler\" party, composed of those Cherokees who had prior\r\nto the treaty of 1835 voluntarily removed west of the Mississippi, and\r\nwho were living under a regularly established form of government of\r\ntheir own.\r\n\r\n2. The \"Treaty\" or \"Ridge\" party, being that portion of the nation led\r\nby John Ridge, and who encouraged and approved the negotiation of the\r\ntreaty of 1835.\r\n\r\n3. The \"Government\" or \"Ross\" party, comprising numerically a large\r\nmajority of the nation, who followed in the lead of John Ross, for many\r\nyears the principal chief of the nation, and who had been consistently\r\nand bitterly hostile to the treaty of 1835 and to any surrender of\r\ntheir territorial rights east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the emigrants in their new homes, the Ross party\r\ninsisted upon the adoption of a new system of government and a code\r\nof laws for the whole nation. To this the Old Settler party objected,\r\nand were supported by the Ridge party, claiming that the government\r\nand laws already adopted and in force among the Old Settlers should\r\ncontinue to be binding until the general election should take place in\r\nthe following October, when the newly elected legislature could enact\r\nsuch changes as wisdom and good policy should dictate.[454] A general\r\ncouncil of the whole nation was, however, called to meet at the new\r\ncouncil-house at Takuttokah, having in view a unification of interests\r\nand the pacification of all animosities. The council lasted from\r\nthe 10th to the 22d of June, but resulted in no agreement. Some six\r\nthousand Cherokees were present. A second council was called by John\r\nRoss for a similar purpose, to meet at the Illinois camp-ground on the\r\n1st of July, 1839.[455]\r\n\r\n_Murder of Boudinot and the Ridges._--Immediately following the\r\nadjournment of the Takuttokah council three of the leaders of the\r\nTreaty party, John Ridge, Major Ridge his father, and Elias Boudinot\r\nwere murdered[456] in the most brutal and atrocious manner. The\r\nexcitement throughout the nation became intense. Boudinot was murdered\r\nwithin 300 yards of his house, and only 2 miles distant from the\r\nresidence of John Ross. The friends of the murdered men were persuaded\r\nthat the crimes had been committed at the instigation of Ross, as it\r\nwas well known that the murderers were among his followers. Ross's\r\nfriends, however, at once rallied to his protection and a volunteer\r\nguard of six hundred patrolled the country in the vicinity of his\r\nresidence.[457]\r\n\r\nA number of the chiefs and prominent men of the Old Settler and Ridge\r\nparties fled to Port Gibson for safety. From there on the 28th of\r\nJune, John Brown, John Looney, John Rogers, and John Smith, signing\r\nthemselves as the executive council of the Western Cherokees, addressed\r\na proposition to John Ross to send a delegation of the chiefs and\r\nprincipal men of his party with authority to meet an equal number of\r\ntheir own at Fort Gibson, with a view to reach an amicable agreement\r\nbetween the different factions. Ross responded[458] by inviting them\r\nto meet at the council convened upon his call on the 1st of July,\r\nwhich was declined. A memorial was thereupon[459] addressed to the\r\nauthorities of the United States by Brown, Looney, and Rogers as\r\nchiefs of the Western Cherokees, demanding protection in the territory\r\nand government guaranteed to them by treaty. Against this appeal the\r\nRoss convention or council in session at Illinois camp-ground filed a\r\nprotest.[460] Between the dates of the appeal and the protest a part\r\nof the Old Settlers, acting in concert with Ross and his adherents,\r\npassed resolutions[461] declaratory of their disapproval of the conduct\r\nof Brown and Rogers, and proclaimed their deposition from office as\r\nchiefs. Looney escaped deposition by transferring his fealty to the\r\nRoss party.\r\n\r\n_Unification of Eastern and Western Cherokees._--It is proper to remark\r\nin this connection that on the 12th of July the Ross council adopted\r\nresolutions uniting the Eastern and the Western Cherokees \"into one\r\nbody politic under the style and title of the Cherokee Nation.\" This\r\npaper, without mentioning or referring to the treaty of 1835, speaks\r\nof the late emigration as constrained by the force of circumstances.\r\nThe council also passed[462] a decree, wherein after reciting the\r\nmurders of the Ridges and Boudinot, and that they in conjunction\r\nwith others had by their conduct rendered themselves liable to the\r\npenalties of outlawry, extended to the survivors a full amnesty for\r\npast offenses upon sundry very stringent and humiliating conditions.\r\nThey also passed[463] a decree condoning the crime of the murderers,\r\nsecuring them from any prosecution or punishment by reason thereof,\r\nand declaring them fully restored to the confidence and favor of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n_Treaty of 1835 declared void._--At a council held at Aquohee Camp a\r\ndecree was passed on the 1st of August, declaring the treaty of 1835\r\nvoid, and reasserting the Cherokee title to their old country east of\r\nthe Mississippi. Later in the same month a decree was passed,[464]\r\nciting the appearance before them, under penalty of outlawry, of the\r\nsigners of the treaty of 1835, to answer for their conduct. This act\r\ncalled forth[465] a vigorous protest from General Arbuckle, commanding\r\nFort Gibson, and was supplemented by instructions[466] to him from the\r\nSecretary of War to cause the arrest and trial of Ross as accessory to\r\nthe murder of the Ridges in case he should deem it wise to do so.\r\n\r\n_Constitution adopted by the Cherokee Nation._--A convention summoned\r\nby Ross and composed of his followers, together with such members of\r\nthe Treaty and Old Settler parties as could be induced to participate,\r\nconvened and remained in session at Tahlequah from the 6th to the 10th\r\nof September, 1839. This body adopted a constitution for the Cherokee\r\nNation, which was subsequently accepted and adopted by the Old Settlers\r\nor Western Cherokees in council at Fort Gibson on the 26th of the\r\nfollowing June, and an act of union was entered into between the two\r\nparties on that date.\r\n\r\n_Division of Cherokee territory proposed._--A proposition had been\r\npreviously[467] submitted by the representatives of the Treaty and\r\nOld Settler parties, urging as the only method of securing peace the\r\ndivision of the Cherokee domain and annuities. They recommended that\r\nGeneral Arbuckle and Captain Armstrong be designated to assign to them\r\nand to the Ross party each their proportionate share according to their\r\nnumbers, but the adoption of this act of union avoided any necessity\r\nfor the further consideration of the proposal. As a means also of\r\nrelieving the Cherokees from further internal strife, General Arbuckle\r\nhad,[468] pursuant to the direction of the Secretary of War, notified\r\nthem that, in consequence of his public acts, John Ross would not be\r\nallowed to hold office in the nation, and that a similar penalty was\r\ndenounced against William S. Coody for offensive opinions expressed in\r\nthe presence of the Secretary of War.[469] Little practical effect was\r\nhowever produced upon the standing or influence of these men with their\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nSkeptical of the sincerity of the promises of peace and good feeling\r\nheld out by the act of unification, John Brown, a noted leader and\r\nchief of the Old Settler Cherokees, in conjunction with many of his\r\nfollowers, among whom were a number of wandering Delawares, asked and\r\nobtained permission from the Mexican Government to settle within the\r\njurisdiction of that power, and they were only persuaded to remain by\r\nthe earnest assurances of the Secretary of War that the United States\r\ncould and would fully protect their interests.[470]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEES CHARGE THE UNITED STATES WITH BAD FAITH.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the removal of the Cherokees been effectually\r\naccomplished than the latter began to manifest much dissatisfaction\r\nat what they characterized a lack of good faith on the part of the\r\nGovernment in carrying out the stipulations of the treaty of 1835. The\r\ndefault charged had reference to the matter of payment of their claims\r\nfor spoliations, improvements, annuities, etc. Each winter at least\r\none delegation from the nation maintained a residence in Washington\r\nand urged upon the Executive and Congress with untiring persistency an\r\nadjudication of all disputed matters arising under the treaty.\r\n\r\nAt length the term of President Van Buren expired and was succeeded\r\nby a Whig administration. Then as now, the official acts of an\r\noutgoing political party were considered to be the legitimate subject\r\nof criticism and investigation by its political enemies. President\r\nHarrison lived but a month after assuming the duties of his office, but\r\nVice-President Tyler as his successor considered that the treatment to\r\nwhich the Cherokees had been subjected during Jackson's and Van Buren's\r\nadministrations would afford a field for investigation fraught with a\r\nrich harvest of results in political capital for the Whig party.\r\n\r\n_President Tyler promises a new treaty._--Accordingly, therefore,\r\nin the fall of 1841, just previous to the departure of the Cherokee\r\ndelegation from Washington to their homes, the President agreed to\r\ntake proper measures for the settlement of all their difficulties,\r\nexpressing a determination to open the whole subject of their\r\ncomplaints and to bring their affairs to a satisfactory conclusion\r\nthrough the medium of a new treaty. In conformity with this\r\ndetermination the Commissioner of Indian Affairs[471] instructed the\r\nagent for the Cherokees to procure all the information possible to be\r\nobtained upon every subject connected with Cherokee affairs having a\r\ntendency to throw any light upon the wrongs and injustice they might\r\nhave sustained to the end that full amends could so far as possible be\r\nmade therefor. Before much information was collected under the terms\r\nof these instructions a change seems to have taken place in the views\r\nof the President, and the order for investigation was revoked. The\r\ndraft of the new treaty was, however, in the mean time prepared under\r\ndirection of the Secretary of War. It contained provisions regulating\r\nthe licensing of traders in the Cherokee country, the jurisdiction over\r\ncrimes committed by citizens of the United States resident in that\r\ncountry, the allotment of their lands in severalty by the Cherokee\r\nauthorities, and the establishment of post-offices and post-routes\r\nwithin their limits. It further contemplated the appointment of two\r\ncommissioners, whenever Congress should make provision therefor, whose\r\nduty it should be to examine into and make a report to that body upon\r\nthe character, validity, and equity of all claims of whatsoever kind\r\npresented by Cherokees against the United States, and also to afford\r\nthe Cherokees pecuniary aid in the purchase of a printing press and\r\ntype as well as in the erection of a national council-house. This\r\ntreaty, however, was never consummated.\r\n\r\n_President Jackson's method for compelling Cherokee removal._--In\r\nconnection with this subject of an investigation into the affairs of\r\nthe Cherokees, a confidential letter is to be found on file in the\r\noffice of the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, from Hon. P. M. Butler,\r\nof South Carolina, who had a few months previous to its date[472]\r\nbeen appointed United States agent for the Cherokees, interesting as\r\nthrowing light on the negotiation and conclusion of the treaty of 1835.\r\nMr. Butler says it is alleged, and claimed to be susceptible of proof,\r\nthat Mr. Merriweather, of Georgia, in an interview with President\r\nJackson, a considerable time before the treaty was negotiated, said\r\nto the President, \"We want the Cherokee lands in Georgia, but the\r\nCherokees will not consent to cede them,\" to which the President\r\nemphatically replied, \"You must get clear of them [the Cherokees] by\r\nlegislation. Take judicial jurisdiction over their country; build fires\r\naround them, and do indirectly what you cannot effect directly.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CAPITA PAYMENTS UNDER THE TREATY.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter Mr. Butler, in alluding to the existing difficulties\r\nin the Cherokee Nation, observes that prior to the preceding October\r\nthe Ross party had been largely in the ascendency in the nation,\r\nbut that at their last preceding election the question hinged upon\r\nwhether the \"per capita\" money due them under the treaty of 1835\r\nshould be immediately paid over to the people. The result was in favor\r\nof the Ridge party, who assumed the affirmative of the question, the\r\nopposition of Ross and his party being predicated on the theory that\r\nan acceptance of this money would be an acknowledgment of the validity\r\nof the treaty of 1835. This, it was feared, would have an unfavorable\r\neffect on their efforts to secure the conclusion of a new treaty on\r\nmore satisfactory terms. On the settlement of this per capita tax,\r\nMr. Butler remarks, will depend the peace and safety of the Cherokee\r\nNation, adding that should the rumors afloat prove true, to the effect\r\nthat the per capita money was nearly exhausted, neither the national\r\nfunds in the hands of the treasurer nor the life of Mr. Ross would be\r\nsafe for an hour from the infuriated members of the tribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL MURDERS IN CHEROKEE NATION.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1842 an event occurred which again threw the whole\r\nnation into a state of the wildest excitement. The friends of the\r\nmurdered Ridges and Boudinot had never forgiven the act, nor had\r\ntime served to soften the measure of their resentment against the\r\nperpetrators and their supposed abettors. Stand Watie had long been\r\na leader among the Ridge party and had been marked for assassination\r\nat the time of the murders just alluded to. He was a brother of John\r\nRidge, one of the murdered men, and he now, in virtue of his mission as\r\nan avenger, killed James Foreman, a member of the Ross party and one of\r\nthe culprits in the murder of the Ridges. Although Stand Watie excused\r\nhis conduct on the score of having come to a knowledge of certain\r\nthreats against his life made by Foreman, no event could at that time\r\nhave been more demoralizing and destructive of the earnestly desired\r\nera of peace and good feeling among the Cherokee people. From that\r\ntime forward all hope of a sincere unification of the several tribal\r\nfactions was at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nADJUDICATION COMMISSIONERS APPOINTED.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1842[473] the President appointed John H. Eaton\r\nand James Iredell as commissioners to adjudicate and settle claims\r\nunder the treaty of 1835. Mr. Iredell declined, and Edward B. Hubley\r\nwas appointed[474] to fill his place. This tribunal was created to\r\ncontinue the uncompleted work of the board appointed in 1836 under the\r\nprovisions of the same article, the labors of which had terminated in\r\nMarch, 1839, having been in session more than two years.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 346: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. VII, p. 488.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 347: May 27, 1828.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 348: Letter of War Department to Hugh Montgomery, Cherokee\r\nagent, May 27, 1828, and to General William Carroll, May 30, 1829.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 349: December 18, 1828.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 350: Letter of T.

In the conference which\r\ntook place between the commissioners of the United States and the\r\nChickasaws and Cherokees, it was apparent that their claims conflicted\r\nwith each other on the ridge dividing the waters of Cumberland from\r\nthose of Duck River and around to the Chickasaw Oldtown Creek on\r\nTennessee, thence southwardly, leaving the mountains above the Muscle\r\nShoals on the south side of the river, and to a large stone or flat\r\nrock, where the Choctaw line joined with the Chickasaws. The journal\r\nof occurrences at the time were lodged with the papers of the old\r\nCongress, and probably were transferred to the office of Secretary of\r\nState. On the 7th of January, 1806, in a convention between the United\r\nStates and Cherokees, on the part of the former by Mr. Dearborn, the\r\nUnited States engaged to use their best endeavors to fix a boundary\r\nbetween the Cherokees and Chickasaws, 'beginning at the mouth of Caney\r\nCreek, near the lower part of the Muscle Shoals, and to run up the said\r\ncreek to its head, and in a direct line from thence to the flat stone\r\nor rock, the old corner boundary,' the line between the Creeks and\r\nCherokees east of Coosau River.\r\n\r\n\"In 1802, at the treaty of Fort Wilkinson, it was agreed between the\r\nparties that the line was 'from the High Shoals on Apalatche, the old\r\npath, leaving Stone Mountain to the Creeks, to the shallow ford on the\r\nChatahoochee.'\r\n\r\n\"This agreement was in presence of the commissioners of the United\r\nStates and witnessed by General Pickens and Colonel Hawkins. On the\r\n10th October, 1809, a letter was sent from the Cherokees to the Creeks\r\nand received in February in the public square at Tookaubatche, stating\r\nthe line agreed upon at Fort Wilkinson, and that 'all the waters of\r\nEtowah down to the ten islands below Turkeytown these lands were given\r\nup to the Cherokees at a talk at Chestoe in presence of the Little\r\nPrince, and Tustunnuggee Thlucco Chulioah, of Turkeystown, was the\r\ninterpreter.'\r\n\r\n\"In August, 1814, at the treaty of Fort Jackson, the Creeks and\r\nCherokees were invited to settle their claims, and Colonel Meigs was\r\nengaged for three or four days in aiding them to do so. The result was\r\nthey could not agree, but would at some convenient period agree. This\r\nwas signed by General Jackson, Colonel Hawkins, and Colonel Meigs.\r\n\r\n\"At the convention with the Creeks, in September, 1815, the Cherokees\r\nmanifested a sincere desire to settle their boundaries with the Creeks,\r\nbut the latter first declined and then refused. Tustunnuggee Thlucco,\r\nbeing asked where their boundary was west of Coosau, said there never\r\nwas any boundary fixed and known as such between the parties, and after\r\nmaking Tennessee the boundary from tradition, and that the Cherokees\r\nobtained leave of them to cross it, the policy of the Creeks receiving\r\nall destroyed red people in their confederacy, the Cherokees were\r\npermitted to come over and settle as low down on the west of Coosau\r\nas Hauluthee Hatchee, from thence on the west side of Coosau on all\r\nits waters to its source. He has never heard, and he has examined\r\nall his people who can have any knowledge on the subject, that the\r\nCherokees had any pretensions lower down Coosau on that side. He does\r\nnot believe, and he has never heard, there was any boundary agreed\r\nupon between them. Being asked by Colonel Hawkins his opinion where\r\nthe boundary should be, he says it should go up Hauluthee Hatchee,\r\npassing a level of good land between two mountains, to the head of\r\nItchau Hatchee, and down the same to Tennessee, about 8 or 9 miles\r\nabove Nickajack. In the year 1798 the Cherokees had a settlement at\r\nthe Muscle Shoals, Doublehead and Katagiskee were the chiefs, and the\r\nCreeks had a small settlement above the Creek path on Tennessee. The\r\nCherokee settlement extended southwardly from the shoal probably a mile\r\nand a half. The principal temporary agent for Indian affairs south of\r\nthe Ohio was early instructed in 1777 to ascertain the boundary line\r\nof the four nations, and instructions were given accordingly by him\r\nto Mr. Dinsmore and Mr. Mitchell to aid in doing it. Several attempts\r\nwere made, but all proved abortive, owing to the policy of the Creeks,\r\nwhich was to unite the four nations in one confederacy and the national\r\naffairs of all to be in a convention to be held annually among the\r\nCreeks, where the speaker for the Creeks should preside.\r\n\r\n\"At every attempt made among the Creeks when these conventions met,\r\nthe answer was, 'We have no dividing lines, nor never had, between us.\r\nWe have lines only between us and the white people, our neighbors.' At\r\ntimes, when the subject was discussed in the convention of the Creeks,\r\nthey claimed Tombigby, called by them Choctaw River (Choctau Hatchee),\r\nthe boundary line between them and the Choctaws. Tustunneggee Hopoie,\r\nbrother of the old Efau Hajo (mad dog), who died at ninety-six years\r\nof age, and retained strength of memory and intelligence to this great\r\nage, reported publicly to the agent, 'When he was a boy his father's\r\nhunting camp was at Puttauchau Hatchee (Black Warrior).' His father had\r\nlong been at the head of the Creeks, and always told him 'Choctaw River\r\nwas their boundary with the Choctaws.' He never saw a Choctaw hunting\r\ncamp on this side the Black Warrior.\r\n\r\n\"A true copy from the original.\r\n\r\n  \"PHIL. HAWKINS, JR.,\r\n  \"_Ast. A. I.

C., between Edmund Burke, William\r\n    Armstrong, and Albion K. Parris, commissioners on behalf of the\r\n    United States, and delegates representing each of the three\r\n    factions of the Cherokee Nation, known, respectively, as the\r\n    \"Government party,\" the \"Treaty party,\" and the \"Old Settler\r\n    party.\"_\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nThe preamble recites the difficulties that have long existed between\r\nthe different factions of the nation, and because of the desire to heal\r\nthose differences and to adjust certain claims against the United States\r\ngrowing out of the treaty of 1835 this treaty is concluded, and provides:\r\n\r\n1. The lands now occupied by the Cherokee Nation shall be secured\r\nto the whole Cherokee people for their common use and benefit. The\r\nUnited States will issue a patent therefor to include the 800,000-acre\r\ntract and the western outlet. If the Cherokees become extinct or\r\nabandon the land it shall revert to the United States.\r\n\r\n2. All difficulties and differences heretofore existing between the\r\nseveral parties of the Cherokee Nation are declared to be settled and\r\nadjusted. A general amnesty for all offenses is declared and fugitives\r\nmay return without fear of prosecution. Laws shall be passed for the\r\nequal protection of all. All armed police or military organizations shall\r\nbe disbanded and the laws executed by civil process. Trial by jury is\r\nguaranteed.\r\n\r\n3. The United States agree to reimburse to the Cherokee Nation all\r\nsums unjustly deducted for claims, reservations, expenses, etc., from\r\nthe consideration of $5,000,000 agreed to be paid under the treaty of\r\n1835 to the Cherokees for their lands, and to distribute the same as\r\nprovided in the ninth article of that treaty.\r\n\r\n4. The board of commissioners recently appointed by the President\r\nhave declared that under the provisions of the treaty of 1828 the \"Old\r\nSettlers,\" or Western Cherokees, had no exclusive title to the lands\r\nceded by that treaty as against the Eastern Cherokees, and that by\r\nthe equitable operation of that treaty the former acquired a common\r\ninterest in the Cherokee lands east of the Mississippi. This interest of\r\nthe \"Old Settlers\" was unprovided for by the treaty of 1835. It is\r\ntherefore agreed that a sum equal to one-third of the residuum of per\r\ncapita fund left after a proper adjustment of the account for distribution\r\nunder the treaty of 1835 shall be paid to said \"Old Settlers,\" and\r\nthat in so doing, in estimating the cost of removal and subsistence, it\r\nshall be based upon the rate fixed therefor in the eighth article of the\r\ntreaty of 1835. In consideration of the foregoing the \"Old Settlers\"\r\nrelease to the United States all interest in the Cherokee lands east of\r\nthe Mississippi and all claim to exclusive ownership in the Cherokee\r\nlands west of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n5. The per capita allowance to the \"Western Cherokees,\" or \"Old\r\nSettlers,\" upon the principle above stated, shall be held in trust by the\r\nUnited States and paid out to each individual or head of family or his\r\nrepresentative entitled thereto in person. The President of the United\r\nStates shall appoint five persons as a committee from the \"Old Settlers\"\r\nto determine who are entitled to the per capita allowance.\r\n\r\n6. The United States agree to pay the \"Treaty party\" the sum of\r\n$115,000 for losses and expenses incurred in connection with the treaty\r\nof 1835, of which $5,000 shall be paid to the legal representatives\r\nor heirs of Major Ridge, $5,000 to those of John Ridge, and $5,000\r\nto those of Elias Boudinot. The remainder shall be distributed among\r\nthose who shall be certified by a committee of the \"Treaty party\" as\r\nentitled, provided that the present delegation of the party may deduct\r\n$25,000, to be by them applied to the payment of claims and expenses.\r\nAnd if the said sum of $100,000 should be insufficient to pay all\r\nclaims for losses and damages, then the claimants to be paid pro rata\r\nin full satisfaction of said claims.\r\n\r\n7. All individuals of the \"Western Cherokees\" who have been\r\ndispossessed of salines, the same being their private property, shall\r\nbe compensated therefor by the Cherokee Nation, upon an award to be\r\nmade by the United States agent and a Cherokee commissioner, or the\r\nsalines shall be returned to the respective owners.\r\n\r\n8. The United States agree to pay the Cherokee Nation $2,000 for a\r\nprinting press, etc., destroyed; $5,000 to be equally divided among all\r\nwhose arms were taken from them previous to their removal West by order\r\nof an officer of the United States, and $20,000 in lieu of all claims\r\nof the Cherokee Nation, as a nation, prior to the treaty of 1835,\r\nexcept lands reserved for school funds.\r\n\r\n9. The United States agree to make a fair and just settlement of all\r\nmoneys due to the Cherokees and subject to the per capita division\r\nunder the treaty of December 29, 1835. This settlement to embrace\r\nall sums properly expended or charged to the Cherokees under the\r\nprovisions of said treaty, and which sums shall be deducted from the\r\nsum of $6,647,067. The balance found due to be distributed per capita\r\namong those entitled to receive the same under the treaty of 1835 and\r\nsupplement of 1836, being those residing east of the Mississippi River\r\nat that date.\r\n\r\n10. Nothing herein shall abridge or take away any rights or claims\r\nwhich the Cherokees _now_ residing in States east of the Mississippi\r\nRiver had or may have under the treaty of 1835 and supplement of 1836.\r\n\r\n11. It is agreed that the Senate of the United States shall determine\r\nwhether the amount expended for one year's subsistence of the\r\nCherokees, after their removal under the treaty of 1835 and supplement\r\nof 1836, is properly chargeable to the United States or to the Cherokee\r\nfunds, and, if to the latter, whether such subsistence shall be charged\r\nat a sum greater than $33-1/3 per head; also, whether the Cherokees\r\nshall be allowed interest upon the sums found to be due them; and, if\r\nso, from what date and at what rate.\r\n\r\n12. (The twelfth article was struck out by the Senate.)\r\n\r\n13. This treaty to be obligatory after ratification by the Senate and\r\nPresident of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEES DESIRE A NEW TREATY.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1844 a delegation headed by John Ross arrived in\r\nWashington. In a communication[476] to the Secretary of War they\r\ninclosed a copy of a letter addressed to them by President Tyler on the\r\n20th of September, 1841, previously alluded to, promising them a new\r\ntreaty to settle all disputes arising under the treaty of 1835. They\r\nadvised the Secretary of their readiness to enter upon the negotiation\r\nof the promised treaty, and submitted[477] a statement of the salient\r\npoints of difference to be adjudicated, involving (1) a fair and just\r\nindemnity to be paid to the Cherokee Nation for the country east of the\r\nMississippi from which they were forced to remove; (2) indemnity for\r\nall improvements, ferries, turnpike roads, bridges, etc., belonging to\r\nthe Cherokees; (3) indemnity for spoliations committed upon all other\r\nCherokee property by troops and citizens of the United States prior\r\nand subsequent to the treaty of 1835; (4) that a title in absolute\r\nfee-simple to the country west of the Mississippi be conveyed to the\r\nCherokee Nation by the United States; (5) that the political relations\r\nbetween the Cherokee Nation and the United States be specifically\r\ndefined; (6) that stocks now invested by the President for the Cherokee\r\nNation be guaranteed to yield a specified annual income, and (7) that\r\nprovision be made for those Cherokees residing east of the Mississippi\r\nwho should evince a desire to emigrate to the Cherokee country west of\r\nthat river.\r\n\r\n\r\nFEUDS BETWEEN THE ROSS, TREATY, AND OLD SETTLER PARTIES.\r\n\r\nAt this period delegations representing the anti-Ross parties were\r\nalso in Washington, and their animosities, coupled with the frequent\r\nand unsavory reports of the events happening in the Cherokee country,\r\ndetermined the President to conclude no new treaty until the true cause\r\nwas ascertained and the responsibility fixed for all this turbulence\r\nand crime.[478] The Old Settler and the Treaty parties alleged that\r\ngrievous oppressions were practiced upon them by the Ross party,\r\ninsomuch that they were unable to enjoy their liberty, property,\r\nor lives in safety, or to live in peace in the same community. The\r\nOld Settler delegation alleged that the act of union, by virtue of\r\nwhich their government was superseded and they were subjected to the\r\nconstitution and laws of the Ross party, was never authorized or\r\nsanctioned by the legal representatives of their people. _Per contra_,\r\nthe Ross delegation alleged that the Old Settler and the Treaty parties\r\nenjoyed the same degree of security and the same fullness of rights\r\nthat any other portion of the nation enjoyed, and that the alleged\r\ndissatisfaction was confined to a few restless and ambitious spirits\r\nwhose motto was \"rule or ruin.\"\r\n\r\n_Commissioners appointed to inquire into Cherokee feuds._--In\r\nconsequence of his determination, as above stated, the President\r\nappointed General R. Jones, Col. R. B. Mason, and P. M. Butler\r\ncommissioners, with instructions[479] to proceed to the Cherokee\r\ncountry and ascertain if any considerable portion of the Cherokee\r\npeople were arrayed in hostile feeling toward those who ruled the\r\nnation; whether a corresponding disposition and feeling prevailed among\r\nthe majority who administered the government toward the minority; the\r\nlengths of oppression, resistance, and violence to which the excitement\r\nof each against the other had severally led the opposing parties, and\r\nwhether the discontent was of such extent and intensity among the great\r\nmass of the Old Settler and Treaty parties as to forbid their living\r\npeaceably together under the same government with the Ross party. This\r\ncommission convened at Fort Gibson on the 16th of November,[480] but\r\ntheir labors resulted in nothing of practical benefit to the sorely\r\ndistressed Cherokees.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEATH OF SEQUOYAH OR GEORGE GUESS.\r\n\r\nSequoyah or George Guess, the inventor of the Cherokee alphabet,\r\nremoved to the country west of the Mississippi long anterior to the\r\ntreaty of 1835,[481] and was for several years one of the national\r\ncouncil of the Western Cherokees.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1843 he left his home for Mexico in quest of several\r\nscattered bands of Cherokees who had wandered off to that distant\r\nregion, and whom it was his intention to collect together with a view\r\nto inducing them to return and become again united with their friends\r\nand kindred.\r\n\r\nHe did not meet with the success anticipated. Being quite aged, and\r\nbecoming worn out and destitute, he was unable without assistance\r\nto make the return trip to his home. Agent Butler, learning of his\r\ncondition, reported the fact to the Indian Department[482] and asked\r\nthat sufficient funds be placed at his disposal for the purpose of\r\nsending messengers to bring the old man back. Two hundred dollars\r\nwere authorized[483] to be expended for the purpose, and Oo-no-leh,\r\na Cherokee, was sent on the errand of mercy, but upon reaching Red\r\nRiver he encountered a party of Cherokees from Mexico who advised him\r\nthat Guess had died in the preceding July, and that his remains were\r\ninterred at San Fernando.[484]\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD SETTLER AND TREATY PARTIES PROPOSE TO REMOVE TO MEXICO.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1845 the bulk of the Old Settler and Treaty parties,\r\nhaving become satisfied that it would be impossible for them to\r\nmaintain a peaceful and happy residence in the country of their\r\nadoption while the influence of John Ross continued potent in their\r\nnational government, resolved to seek for themselves a new home on the\r\nborders of Mexico. A council was therefore held at which a delegation\r\n(consisting of forty-three members of the Treaty and eleven of the\r\nOld Settler party) was chosen to explore the country to the south and\r\nwest for a future abode. They rendezvoused[485] at the forks of the\r\nCanadian and Arkansas Rivers, and, after electing a captain, proceeded\r\nvia Fort Washita, crossing the Red River at Coffee's trading house,\r\nand following the ridge dividing the waters of Trinity and Brazos to\r\nthe latter river, which they crossed at Basky Creek. Here they found\r\na small settlement of sixty-three Cherokees, who had moved in the\r\npreceding June from a place called by them Mount Clover, in Mexico.\r\n\r\nAmong their number was found Tessee Guess, the son of George Guess.\r\nLeaving Brazos[486] the explorers traveled westward to the Colorado,\r\nreaching it at the mouth of Stone Fort Creek,[487] beyond which they\r\nproceeded in a southwesterly direction to the San Sabba Creek, at a\r\npoint about 40 or 50 miles above its mouth. They returned on a line\r\nsome 60 miles south of their outgoing trip,[488] and with their friends\r\nheld a council at Dragoon Barracks in the Cherokee Nation.[489] At\r\nthis meeting it was decided to ask the United States to provide them a\r\nhome in the Texas country upon their relinquishment of all interest in\r\nthe Cherokee Nation, or in case of a refusal of this request that the\r\nterritory of the nation be divided into two parts, and a moiety thereof\r\nbe assigned to them with the privilege of adopting their own form of\r\ngovernment and living under it.\r\n\r\nThe governor of Arkansas[490] and General Arbuckle[491] both concurred\r\nin the conclusions reached by this council, and urged upon the\r\nauthorities at Washington the necessary legislation to carry the same\r\ninto effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nMORE POLITICAL MURDERS.\r\n\r\nShortly after the delegation selected by the foregoing council had\r\nproceeded to Washington in the interest of the adoption of the scheme\r\nproposed, another epidemic of murder and outrage broke out in the\r\nnation. On the 23d of March, Agent McKissick reported to the Indian\r\nDepartment the murder of Stand, a prominent member of the Ross party,\r\nby Wheeler Faught, at the instigation of the \"Starr boys,\" who were\r\nsomewhat noted leaders of the Treaty party. This murder was committed\r\nin revenge for the killing of James Starr and others during the\r\noutbreak of the preceding November. It was followed[492] by the\r\nmurder of Cornsilk, another of Ross's adherents, by these same \"Starr\r\nboys,\" and six days later the spirit of retaliation led to the killing\r\nof Turner, a member of the Treaty party. On the 25th of the same\r\nmonth[493] Ellis, Dick, and Billy Starr were wounded by a band of\r\nRoss's Cherokee police, who chased them across the line of Arkansas\r\nin the attempt to arrest them for trial before the Cherokee tribunals\r\nfor the murder of Too-noo-wee two days before. General Arbuckle took\r\nthem under his protection, and refused to deliver them up for trial to\r\nthe Cherokee authorities until the latter should take proper steps to\r\npunish the murderers of James Starr. Subsequently Baldridge and Sides,\r\nof the Ross party, were murdered by Jim and Tom Starr, in revenge for\r\nwhich the light horse police company of the Ross government murdered\r\nBilly Ryder, of the Treaty party.[494]\r\n\r\nIn this manner the excitement was maintained and the outrages\r\nmultiplied until, on the 28th of August, Agent McKissick reported\r\nthat since the 1st of November preceding there had been an aggregate\r\nof thirty-three murders committed in the Cherokee Nation, nearly all\r\nof which were of a political character. The feeling of alarm became\r\nso widespread that General Arbuckle was constrained to increase the\r\nmilitary force on the frontier by two companies.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGOTIATION OF TREATY OF 1846.\r\n\r\nWhile these unhappy events were in progress Major Armstrong,\r\nsuperintendent of Indian affairs, who was in Washington, submitted\r\nto the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, at the suggestion of the\r\nseveral Cherokee delegations, a proposition for the appointment of\r\na commissioner clothed with full powers to adjust all difficulties\r\nbetween the various factions of their people.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner replied that as the matter was before Congress and\r\nwould likely receive the speedy attention of that body, no action would\r\nbe justified by the executive authorities without first being assured\r\nthat the proposition was founded in good faith and would result in some\r\ncertain and satisfactory arrangement. He must also have assurance that\r\nthere existed a firm determination on the part of the Department and\r\nof Congress to bring these troubles to a close before the adjournment\r\nof the latter body. The Commissioner, however, drew up a memorandum\r\nagreement for the signature of the several delegations of Cherokees\r\nrepresenting the different factions of the tribe. It provided for\r\nthe appointment of three commissioners, whose duty it should be to\r\nexamine into all matters in controversy and adjust the same, and that\r\nall parties should abide absolutely by their decision, agreeing to\r\nexecute and sign such treaty or other instrument of agreement as should\r\nbe considered necessary to insure the execution of the award of the\r\ncommissioners.[495] This agreement was duly signed by the members of\r\nthe several delegations present in Washington, and in pursuance of\r\nits provisions President Polk appointed[496] Edmund Burke, William\r\nArmstrong, and Albion K. Parris commissioners with the powers and for\r\nthe purposes above indicated. These commissioners at once entered into\r\ncommunication and negotiation with the three delegations representing\r\nthe different factions of the Cherokee Nation, which were then in\r\nWashington, and the result was the conclusion of the treaty of August\r\n6, 1846,[497] in thirteen articles, making detailed provision for the\r\nadjustment of all questions of dispute between the Cherokees themselves\r\nand also for the settlement of all claims by the Cherokees against\r\nthe United States.[498] This treaty, with some slight amendments, was\r\nratified and proclaimed by the President on the 17th of the same month;\r\nan abstract of its provisions has already been presented. It was not\r\nuntil this treaty that the Ross party ever consented in any manner to\r\nrecognize or be bound by the treaty of 1835.[499]\r\n\r\n_Objects of the treaty._--The main principle involved in the\r\nnegotiation of the treaty of 1846 had been the disposition on the part\r\nof the United States to reimburse to the Cherokee fund sundry sums\r\nwhich, although not justly chargeable upon it, had been improperly paid\r\nout of that fund.[500] In the treaty of 1835 the United States had\r\nagreed to pay to the Cherokees $5,000,000 for their lands and $600,000\r\nfor spoliations, claims, expenses of removal, etc.[501] By the act of\r\nJune 12, 1838,[502] Congress appropriated the further sum of $1,047,067\r\nfor expenses of removal. As all these sums were for objects expressed\r\nin the treaty of 1835, the commissioners who negotiated the treaty of\r\n1846 regarded them as one aggregate sum given by the United States\r\nfor the lands of the Cherokees, subject to the charges, expenditures,\r\nand investments provided for in the treaty. This aggregate sum was\r\nappropriated and placed in the Treasury of the United States, to be\r\ndisposed of according to the stipulations of the treaty. The United\r\nStates thereby became the trustee of this fund for the benefit of the\r\nCherokee people, and were bound to manage it in accordance with the\r\nwell known principles of law and equity which regulate the relation of\r\ntrustee and _cestui que trust_.\r\n\r\n_Adjudication of the treaty of 1835._--In order, therefore, to carry\r\nout the principle thus established by the treaty of 1846, Congress,\r\nby joint resolution, of August 7, 1848,[503] required the proper\r\naccounting officers of the Treasury to make a just and fair statement\r\nof account with the Cherokee Nation upon that basis. The joint\r\nreport of the Second Comptroller and Second Auditor was submitted to\r\nCongress[504] after a full and thorough examination of all the accounts\r\nand vouchers of the several officers and agents of the United States\r\nwho had disbursed funds appropriated to carry into effect the treaty of\r\n1835, and also of all claims that had been admitted at the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe result of this examination showed that there had been paid--\r\n\r\n  For improvements                                        $1,540,572 27\r\n\r\n  For ferries                                                159,572 12\r\n\r\n  For spoliations                                            264,894 09\r\n\r\n  For removal and subsistence and commutation therefor,\r\n  including $2,765.84 expended for goods for the poorer\r\n  Cherokees under the fifteenth article of treaty of\r\n  1835, and including also necessary incidental expenses\r\n  of enrolling agents, conductors, commissioners,\r\n  medical attendance, and supplies, etc.                   2,952,196 26\r\n\r\n  For debts and claims upon the Cherokee Nation              101,348 31\r\n\r\n  For the additional quantity of land ceded to the nation    500,000 00\r\n\r\n  For amount invested as the general fund of the nation      500,880 00\r\n\r\n                                                           ____________\r\n\r\n  The aggregate of which sums is                           6,019,463 05\r\n\r\n  which, being deducted from the sum of                    6,647,067 00\r\n\r\n                                                           ____________\r\n\r\n  agreeably to the directions of the ninth article of\r\n  the treaty of 1846, left a balance due the Cherokee\r\n  Nation of                                                  627,603 95\r\n\r\nThey also reported that there was a further sum of $96,999.31, charged\r\nto the general treaty fund, which had been paid to the various agents\r\nof the Government connected with the removal of the Indians and which\r\nthe Cherokees contended was an improper charge upon their fund. The\r\nfacts as to this item were submitted by the Auditor and Comptroller\r\nwithout recommendation for the decision of the question by Congress,\r\nand Congress, admitting the justice of the Cherokee claim, included\r\nthis sum in the subsequent appropriation of February 27, 1851.[505]\r\n\r\nIt was also resolved[506] by the United States Senate (as umpire under\r\nthe treaty of 1846) that the Cherokee Nation was entitled to the sum of\r\n$189,422.76 for subsistence, being the difference between the amount\r\nallowed by act of June 12, 1838, and the amount actually paid and\r\nexpended by the United States, and which excess was improperly charged\r\nto the treaty fund in the report of the accounting officers of the\r\nTreasury just recited. It was further resolved that interest at 5 per\r\ncent. should be allowed upon the sums found due the Eastern and Western\r\nCherokees respectively from June 12, 1838. The amount of this award\r\nwas made available to the Cherokees by Congressional appropriation of\r\nSeptember 30, 1850.[507]\r\n\r\n_Settlement of claims of \"Old Settler\" party._--By the fourth and\r\nfifth articles of the treaty of 1846,[508] provision is made and a\r\nbasis fixed for the settlement with that part of the Cherokee Nation\r\nknown as \"Old Settlers\" or \"Western Cherokees,\" or, in other words,\r\nthose who had emigrated under the treaties of 1817,[509] 1819,[510]\r\nand 1828,[511] and who were, at the date of the treaty of 1835,[512]\r\nan organized and separate nation of Indians, whom the United States\r\nhad recognized as such by the treaties of 1828 and 1833[513] made with\r\nthem. In making the treaty of 1835 with the Cherokees east, which\r\nprovided for their final and complete transfer to the country west,\r\nthen occupied by the \"Western Cherokees,\" and guaranteed in perpetuity\r\nby two treaties, upon considerations alone connected with them, the\r\nrights of the latter seem to have been forgotten. The consequences\r\nof the influx of the Eastern Cherokees were such that upon their\r\narrival the \"Old Settlers\" were thrown into a hopeless minority; their\r\ngovernment was subverted, and a new one, imported with the emigrants\r\ncoerced under the treaty of 1835, substituted in its place.\r\n\r\nTo allay the discontent thus caused in the minds of the \"Old Settlers,\"\r\nand to provide compensation to them for the undivided interest which\r\nthe United States regarded them as owning in the country east of the\r\nMississippi, under the equitable operation of the treaty of 1828,\r\nwas one of the avowed objects of the treaty of 1846. To ascertain\r\ntheir interest it was assumed that they constituted one-third of the\r\nentire nation, and should therefore be entitled to an amount equal\r\nto one-third of the treaty fund of 1835, after all just charges were\r\ndeducted. This residuum of the treaty fund, contemplated by the\r\nfourth article of the treaty of 1846, amounted, as first calculated,\r\nto $1,571,346.55, which would make the proportionate share of the\r\n\"Old Settlers\" amount to the sum of $523,782.18. The act of September\r\n30, 1850,[514] made provision for the payment to the \"Old Settlers,\"\r\nin full of all demands under the provisions and according to the\r\nprinciples established in the fourth article of the treaty of 1846, of\r\nthe sum of $532,896.96 with interest at 5 per cent. per annum. This was\r\ncoupled with the proviso that the Indians who should receive the money\r\nshould first respectively sign a receipt or release acknowledging the\r\nsame to be in full of all demands under the terms of such article.\r\n\r\nA year later,[515] when the \"Old Settlers\" were assembled for the\r\npurpose of receiving this per capita money, although their necessities\r\nwere such as to compel compliance with the conditions of payment, they\r\nentered a written protest against the sum paid being considered in full\r\nof all their demands, and appealed to the United States for justice,\r\nindicating at the same time in detail wherein they were entitled to\r\nreceive large additional sums.\r\n\r\nFor many years this additional claim of the \"Old Settlers\" practically\r\nlay dormant. But toward the close[516] of the year 1875 they held\r\na convention or council at Tahlequah, the capital of the Cherokee\r\nNation, and resolved to prosecute their claim to a \"speedy, just, and\r\nfinal settlement.\" To that end three of their people were appointed\r\ncommissioners with full power to prosecute the claim, employ counsel,\r\nand to do all other necessary and proper things in the premises. The\r\ncouncil set apart and appropriated 35 per centum of whatever should\r\nbe collected to defray all the necessary expenses attendant upon such\r\nprosecution and collection. Several subsequent councils have been\r\nheld about the subject,[517] and the matter continued to be pressed\r\nupon the attention of Congress until, by the terms of an act approved\r\nAugust 7, 1882,[518] that body directed the Secretary of the Interior\r\nto investigate this and other matters relating to the Cherokees and to\r\nreport thereon to Congress. Pursuant to the purpose of this enactment,\r\nMr. C. C. Clements was appointed a special agent of the Interior\r\nDepartment with instructions to make the required investigation.\r\nHe submitted three reports on the subject, the latter two being\r\nsupplemental to and corrective of the first. From this last report[519]\r\nit appears that he finds the sum of $421,653.68 to be due to the \"Old\r\nSettler\" Cherokees, together with interest at 5 per cent. per annum\r\nfrom September 22, 1851. In brief his findings are--\r\n\r\n1. That they received credit, under the settlement made under the\r\ntreaty of 1846, for one-third of the fund, and were chargeable with\r\none-third of the items properly taxable thereto.\r\n\r\n2. Independent of article four of the treaty of 1846, the \"Old\r\nSettlers\" were not chargeable with removal out of the $5,000,000 fund.\r\n\r\n3. Independent of that article, they should not be charged out of the\r\n$5,000,000 fund with the removal of the Eastern Cherokees, for three\r\nreasons: (_a_) The \"Old Settlers\" removed themselves at their own\r\nexpense; (_b_) the Eastern Cherokees were not required to reimburse the\r\n\"Old Settlers\" under the treaty of 1835; and (_c_) the Government was\r\nrequired to remove the Eastern Cherokees.\r\n\r\n4. They were not properly chargeable with the removal of the Ross\r\nparty of 13,148, because (_a_) the United States were to remove them,\r\nand (_b_) an appropriation of $1,047,067 was made for that purpose, for\r\nwhich the \"Old Settlers\" received no credit in the settlement under the\r\ntreaty of 1846.\r\n\r\n5. Having received credit for their proportion of the $600,000, under\r\narticle three of the treaty of 1836, they were chargeable with their\r\nproportion of that fund used for removal, etc., _i.e._, 2,495 Indians\r\nat $53.33 per head, amounting to $133,058.35.\r\n\r\n6. The Eastern Cherokees were properly chargeable with the removal of\r\nthe Ross party, and therefore they received credit for the $1,047,067\r\nappropriated by the act of June 12, 1838.\r\n\r\n7. In the settlement, the $5,600,000 fund was charged with the removal\r\nand subsistence of 18,026 Indians at $53.33-1/3 per head, amounting to\r\n$961,386.66.[520]\r\n\r\nThis report, with accompanying letters of the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs and the Secretary of the Interior, was transmitted to Congress\r\nby the President, with a special message, on the 17th of December, 1883.\r\n\r\n_Other questions under the treaty of 1835._--There were two other\r\nquestions about which the parties could not agree, and upon which, by\r\nthe eleventh article of the treaty of 1846, the Senate of the United\r\nStates was designated as the umpire. The first of these was whether\r\nthe amount expended for the one year's subsistence of the Eastern\r\nCherokees, after their arrival in the West, should be borne by the\r\nUnited States or by the Cherokee funds, and, if by the latter, then\r\nwhether subsistence should be charged at a greater rate than $33-1/3\r\nper head.\r\n\r\nThe Senate committee to whom the subject was referred for report to\r\nthat body found much difficulty, as shown by their report, in reaching\r\na just conclusion. They observed that the faulty manner in which the\r\ntreaty of 1835 was drawn, its ambiguity of terms, and the variety\r\nof constructions placed upon it, had led to a great embarrassment\r\nin arriving at the real intention of the parties, but that upon the\r\nwhole the opinion seemed to be justified that the charge should be\r\nborne by the United States. By a strict construction of the treaty\r\nof 1835, the expense of a year's subsistence of the Indians was no\r\ndoubt a proper charge upon the treaty fund and was so understood by\r\nthe Government at the time. In the original scheme of the treaty\r\nfurnished the commissioners empowered to treat with the Indians this\r\nitem was enumerated among the expenditures, etc., to be provided\r\nfor in its several articles, and which made up the aggregate sum of\r\n$5,000,000 to be paid for the Cherokee country. The Secretary of War,\r\nin a letter addressed to John Ross and others in 1836, had said that\r\nthe United States, having allowed the full consideration for their\r\ncountry, nothing further would be conceded for expenses of removal and\r\nsubsistence. The whole history of the negotiation of the treaty shows\r\nthat the $5,000,000 was the maximum sum which the United States were\r\nwilling to pay, and that this was not so much a consideration for\r\nthe lands and possessions of the Indians as an indemnity to cover the\r\nnecessary sacrifices and losses in the surrender of one country and\r\ntheir removal to another.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, among the circumstances establishing the propriety\r\nof a contrary construction may be mentioned the language of the eighth\r\narticle of the treaty, that \"the United States also agree and stipulate\r\nto remove the Cherokees to their new homes and to subsist them one\r\nyear after their arrival there.\" This language imports pecuniary\r\nresponsibility rather than a simple disbursement of a trust fund. In\r\nthe \"talk\" also which was sent[521] by President Jackson to the Indians\r\nto explain the advantages of the proposed treaty, he mentioned that the\r\nstipulations offered \"provide for the removal at the expense of the\r\nUnited States of your whole people, and for their subsistence a year\r\nafter their arrival in their new country.\"\r\n\r\nIt was also the common practice of the United States in removing the\r\nIndian tribes from one locality to another to defray the expense of\r\nsuch removal, and this was done in the cases of their neighbors,\r\nthe Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks, and Seminoles. It is a matter of\r\nbut little surprise, therefore, that a conflicting interpretation\r\nof this treaty through a series of years should have produced grave\r\nembarrassments.\r\n\r\nIndependent, however, of the literal provisions of the treaty of 1835,\r\nthere existed other grounds upon which to base a judgment favorable to\r\nthe claims of the Cherokees. The treaty with the supplementary article\r\nwas finally ratified on the 23d of May, 1836, and by its provisions\r\nthe Cherokees were required to remove within two years. It had been\r\nconcluded (in the face of a protest from a large majority) with a small\r\nminority of the nation. Within the two years those who had favored the\r\ntreaty had mostly emigrated to the West under its provisions.[522] The\r\nlarge majority of the nation, adopting the counsels of John Ross, had\r\nobstinately withstood all the efforts of the Government to induce them\r\nto adopt the treaty or emigrate. They had repudiated its obligation\r\nand denounced it as a fraud upon the nation. In the mean time the\r\nUnited States had appointed its agents under the treaty and collected\r\na large military force to compel its execution. The State of Georgia\r\nhad adopted a system of hostile legislation intended to drive them from\r\nthe country. She had surveyed their territory and disposed of their\r\nhomes and firesides by lottery. She had dispossessed them of a portion\r\nof their lands, subjected them to her laws, and at the same time\r\ndisqualified them from the enjoyment of any political or civil rights.\r\nIn this posture of affairs, the Cherokees who had never abandoned the\r\nvain hope of remaining in the country of their birth or of obtaining\r\nbetter terms from the United States made new proposals to the United\r\nStates through John Ross and others for the sale of their country and\r\nemigration to the West. Still pursuing the idea that they were aliens\r\nto the treaty of 1835 and unfettered by its provisions, they proposed\r\nto release all claim to their country and emigrate for a named sum\r\nof money in connection with other conditions, among which was the\r\nstipulation that they should be allowed to take charge of their own\r\nemigration and that the United States should pay the expenses thereof.\r\nTo avoid the necessity of enforcing the treaty at the point of the\r\nbayonet and to obtain relief from counter obligations to Georgia by the\r\ncompact of 1802 and to the Cherokees by the treaties of 1817 and 1819,\r\nthe proposal was readily acceded to by the United States authorities.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of May, 1838, the Secretary of War addressed a reply to the\r\nproposals of the Cherokee delegation, in which he said:\r\n\r\n    If it be desired by the Cherokee Nation that their own agents\r\n    should have charge of their emigration, their wishes will be\r\n    complied with and instructions be given to the commanding general\r\n    in the Cherokee country to enter into arrangements with them to\r\n    that effect. With regard to the expense of this operation, which\r\n    you ask may be defrayed by the United States, in the opinion of the\r\n    undersigned the request ought to be granted, and an application for\r\n    such further sum as may be required for this purpose shall be made\r\n    to Congress.\r\n\r\nA recommendation was made to Congress in compliance with this promise.\r\nBased upon an estimate of the probable cost thereof, Congress by act of\r\nJune 12, 1838,[523] appropriated the sum of $1,047,067 in full for all\r\nobjects specified in the third article of the treaty and the further\r\nobject of aiding in the subsistence of the Indians for one year after\r\ntheir removal, with the proviso that no part thereof should be deducted\r\nfrom the $5,000,000 purchase money of their lands.\r\n\r\nHere was a clear legislative affirmation of the terms offered by\r\nthe Indians and acceded to by the Secretary of War. It was a new\r\ncontract with the Ross party, outside of the treaty, or rather a new\r\nconsideration offered to abide by its terms, by which the Secretary of\r\nWar agreed that the expenses of removal and subsistence, as provided\r\nfor by the treaty of 1835, should be borne by the United States,\r\nand Congress affirmed this act by providing that no part of the sum\r\nappropriated should be charged to the treaty fund. The appropriation\r\nthus made proved wholly inadequate for the purposes of removal and\r\nsubsistence, the expense of which aggregated $2,952,196.26,[524] of\r\nwhich the sum of $972,844.78 was expended for subsistence. Of this last\r\namount, however, $172,316.47 was furnished to the Indians when in great\r\ndestitution upon their own urgent application, after the expiration\r\nof the \"one year,\" upon the understanding that it was to be deducted\r\nfrom the moneys due them under the treaty. This left the net sum of\r\n$800,528.31 paid for subsistence and charged to the aggregate fund. Of\r\nthis sum the United States provided by the act of June 12, 1838, for\r\n$611,105.55, leaving unprovided for, the sum of $189,422.76. This,\r\nadded to the balance of $724,603.37 found due in pursuance of the\r\nreport of the accounting officers of the Treasury,[525] amounted in the\r\naggregate to $914,626.13.\r\n\r\nThe item of $189,422.76 was appropriated, as previously stated, by\r\nthe act of September 30, 1850, and that of $724,603.37 by the act of\r\nFebruary 27, 1851. Interest was allowed on each sum at the rate of 5\r\nper cent. per annum from the date of the act of June 12, 1838, with\r\nthe understanding that it should be in full satisfaction and a final\r\nsettlement of all claims and demands whatsoever of the Cherokee Nation\r\nagainst the United States under any treaty theretofore made with them.\r\nInstructions were issued[526] in the fall of 1851 to John Drennan,\r\nsuperintendent of Indian affairs, to proceed without delay to make the\r\npayment. For this purpose a remittance was made to him at New Orleans\r\nof the sums of $1,032,182.33 and $276,179.84. The first of these sums,\r\nhe was advised by his instructions, was intended for the per capita\r\npayment, principal and interest, to the Eastern Cherokees, or Ross\r\nparty, in pursuance of the act of February 27, 1851. The latter was for\r\na similar payment to the same parties in compliance with the terms of\r\nthe act of September 30, 1850, previously mentioned. These sums were to\r\nbe distributed, according to the census roll, among 14,098 Cherokees\r\nwithin his superintendency, and were exclusive of the pro rata share to\r\nwhich those Cherokees east of the Mississippi living within the States\r\nof North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama were entitled. For\r\nthe payment of the latter a clerk was detailed from duty in the Office\r\nof Indian Affairs to act in the capacity of a special disbursing agent.\r\n\r\nThe payments made by Superintendent Drennan, coupled with the\r\nconditions prescribed by the act of Congress, were very unsatisfactory\r\nto the Government or Ross party of Cherokees. Therefore their national\r\ncouncil addressed[527] to the United States a solemn and formal protest\r\nagainst the injustice they had suffered through the treaties of 1835\r\nand 1846, and the statement of account rendered by the United States\r\nunder the provisions of those treaties.[528] After thus placing\r\nthemselves on record, the Cherokees accepted the money and complied\r\nwith the conditions prescribed in the act of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFAIRS OF THE NORTH CAROLINA CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nAs has been already remarked, at the time of the general removal of\r\nthe Cherokee Nation in 1838 many individuals fled to the mountains\r\nof Tennessee and North Carolina and refused to emigrate. They always\r\nmaintained their right to an equal participation in the personal\r\nbenefits provided in the treaty of 1835, which, though not denied,\r\nwas held by the executive authorities of the United States to be\r\nconditional upon their removal west. At length by an act of Congress\r\napproved July 29, 1848,[531] provision was made for causing a census\r\nto be taken of all those Cherokees who remained in the State of North\r\nCarolina after the ratification of the treaty of 1835 and who had not\r\nsince removed west. An appropriation was made equal to $53.33-1/3 for\r\neach of such individuals or his or her representative, with interest at\r\n6 per cent per annum from the 23d of May, 1836. Furthermore, whenever\r\nany of such individuals should manifest a desire to remove and join the\r\ntribe west of the Mississippi, the Secretary of War was authorized to\r\nexpend their pro rata share of the foregoing fund, or so much thereof\r\nas should be necessary, toward defraying the expense of such removal\r\nand subsistence for one year thereafter, the balance, if any, to be\r\npaid to the individual entitled. The amount of this appropriation,\r\nit was stipulated, should be refunded to the United States Treasury\r\nfrom the general fund of the Cherokee Nation under the treaty of\r\n1835. The census mentioned was taken by J. C. Mullay in 1849, and\r\nthe number found to be entitled to the benefits of the appropriation\r\nwas 1,517,[532] which by additions was increased to 2,133. Under the\r\nappropriation acts of September 30, 1850, and February 27, 1851, these\r\nCherokees remaining east of the Mississippi were entitled to their\r\npro rata share of the amounts thus appropriated. Alfred Chapman was\r\naccordingly detailed[529] from the Interior Department to make the per\r\ncapita payment, and was furnished with the amounts of $41,367.31 and\r\n$156,167.19 under those respective acts. He was directed to base his\r\npayments upon the census roll furnished him, which showed 2,133 Indians\r\nto be entitled. By section 3 of an act approved March 3, 1855,[530]\r\nprovision was made for the distribution per capita among the North\r\nCarolina Cherokees on the Mullay roll[533] of the fund established\r\nby the act of July 29, 1848, provided that each Indian so receiving\r\nsuch payment in full should assent thereto. As a further condition\r\nto the execution of this act it was stipulated that satisfactory\r\nassurance should be given by the State of North Carolina, before such\r\npayment, that the Cherokees in question should be permitted to remain\r\npermanently in that State. The desired legislative assurance was\r\nnot given by North Carolina until February 19, 1866, and the money\r\nwas not, therefore, distributed, but carried to the surplus fund in\r\nthe Treasury. Afterwards, by act of March 3, 1875,[534] it was made\r\napplicable to the purchase and payment of lands, expenses in quieting\r\ntitles, etc.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine who were the legal heirs and representatives\r\nof those enrolled in 1849, but since deceased, the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior was directed by an act of Congress, approved July 27,\r\n1868,[535] to cause another census to be taken, to serve as a guide\r\nin future payments. It was further provided by the same act that the\r\nSecretary of the Interior should cause the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs to take the same supervisory charge of this as of any other\r\ntribe of Indians.\r\n\r\nThis second census was taken by S. H. Sweatland in 1869, and he was\r\ninstructed to make payment of interest then due to the Indians, guided\r\nby his roll, but on the same principle on which previous payments had\r\nbeen effected, that is, to those individuals only whose names appeared\r\non the Mullay census roll, or their legal heirs or representatives,\r\nas ascertained by census taken by himself. As remarked by the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs, the difficulty of tracing Indian\r\ngenealogy through its various complications, in order to determine who\r\nare legal representatives of deceased Indians, without any rules by\r\nwhich hereditary descent among them may be clearly established, was\r\nfully demonstrated in the payment made by Mr. Sweatland, which was the\r\noccasion of many complaints and even of litigation.\r\n\r\nThe landed interests of these North Carolina Cherokees had also\r\nsince the treaty of 1835 become much complicated, and through their\r\nconfidence in others, coupled with their own ignorance of proper\r\nbusiness methods, they were likely to lose the title to their homes.\r\nAt this juncture Congress, by an act approved July 15, 1870,[536]\r\nauthorized suit in equity to be brought in the name of the Eastern Band\r\nof Cherokee Indians in the district or circuit courts of the United\r\nStates for the recovery of their interest in certain lands in North\r\nCarolina. This suit was instituted in the circuit court of the United\r\nStates for the western district of North Carolina in May, 1873, against\r\nWilliam. H. Thomas and William Johnston. Thomas, as the agent and\r\ntrustee of the Indians, it was alleged had received (between 1836 and\r\n1861) from them and for their benefit large sums of money, which had or\r\nought to have been invested by him, in pursuance of various contracts\r\nwith the Indians, in certain boundaries of land as well as in a number\r\nof detached tracts. The legal title to all these lands was taken by\r\nThomas, and was still held in his own name, he having in the mean time\r\nbecome _non compos mentis_. It was alleged against the other defendant,\r\nJohnston, that in the year 1869 he had procured sales to be made of\r\nall these lands to satisfy judgments obtained by him against Thomas,\r\nand that he had bought in the lands at these sales and taken sheriff's\r\ndeeds therefor, although having himself a knowledge of the existing\r\nequities of the Indians. In fact, that after the purchase of the lands\r\nhe had entered into a contract with the Indians to release to them all\r\nthe rights he had acquired by such purchase for the sum of $30,000,\r\npayable within eighteen months. Under this contract, and at the time of\r\nits execution, the Indians paid him $6,500.\r\n\r\nA suit in law was also instituted, at the same time with the foregoing,\r\nagainst James W. Terrell, their former agent (from 1853 to 1861), and\r\nhis sureties, the above named Thomas and Johnston, to recover a balance\r\nof Cherokee funds which he had received for their use from the United\r\nStates and which it was alleged he had not properly accounted for.\r\n\r\nAt the May term, 1874, of the circuit court the matters in dispute\r\nwere by agreement submitted to a board of arbitrators. The arbitrators\r\nmade their report and award, which were confirmed by the court at the\r\nNovember term, 1874.\r\n\r\nThe award finds that Thomas purchased for the Indians as a tribe and\r\nwith their funds a large tract of land on Soco Creek and Oconalufty\r\nRiver and their tributaries, known as the Qualla boundary, and\r\nestimated by the arbitrators to contain 50,000 acres. It declares\r\nthat such tract belongs to and shall be held by the Eastern Band of\r\nCherokees as a tribe.\r\n\r\nThe award also determines the titles of a large number of individual\r\nIndians to tracts of land outside of the Qualla boundary. It further\r\nfinds that the Indians owe Thomas a balance toward the purchase-money\r\nof the Qualla boundary of $18,250, from which should be deducted the\r\nsum of $6,500 paid by the Indians to Johnston, with interest thereon to\r\nthe date of the award, amounting in the aggregate to $8,486.\r\n\r\nThe award also finds that Terrell and his bondsmen are responsible to\r\nthe Cherokees for an unaccounted-for balance of $2,697.89, which should\r\nalso be deducted from the amount due Thomas, leaving a net balance\r\ndue from the Indians on the purchase money of the Qualla boundary of\r\n$7,066. Upon the payment of this sum the award declares they should be\r\nentitled to a conveyance from Johnston of the legal title to all the\r\nlands embraced within that boundary.[537]\r\n\r\nTo enable the Indians to clear off this lien upon their lands,\r\nCongress, upon the recommendation of the Indian Department, provided\r\nby the terms of an act approved March 3, 1875,[538] that the funds\r\nset apart by the act of July 29, 1848, should be applied under the\r\ndirection of the Secretary of the Interior for the use and benefit of\r\nthe Eastern Band of Cherokees. Specifically these funds were to be used\r\nin perfecting the titles to the lands awarded to them and to pay the\r\ncosts, expenses, and liabilities attending their recent litigations,\r\nalso to purchase and extinguish the titles of any white persons to\r\nlands within the general boundaries allotted to them by the court and\r\nfor the education, improvement, and civilization of their people.\r\nThis was done and the Indians have now possession of their rightful\r\ndomain.[539]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSED REMOVAL OF THE CATAWBA INDIANS TO THE CHEROKEE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps pertinent to remark before proceeding further that by\r\nthe terms of an act of Congress approved July 29, 1848 (United States\r\nStatutes at Large, Vol. IX, p. 264), an appropriation of $5,000 was\r\nmade to defray the expenses of removing the Catawba Indians from\r\nCarolina to the country west of the Mississippi River, provided\r\ntheir assent should be obtained, and also conditioned upon success\r\nin securing a home for them among some other congenial tribe in that\r\nregion without cost to the Government.\r\n\r\nThese Catawbas were but a miserable remnant of what a century and a\r\nhalf earlier had been one of the most powerful and warlike of the\r\nSouthern tribes. They once occupied and controlled a large region\r\nof country in the two Carolinas, though principally in the Southern\r\nprovince. Their generally accepted western limit was the Catawba\r\nRiver and its tributaries, the region between this river and Broad\r\nRiver being usually denominated a neutral hunting ground for both the\r\nCatawbas and the Cherokees. An enmity of long standing had existed\r\nbetween the Catawbas and the Six Nations, and war parties of both\r\nnations for many years were wont to make long and devastating forays\r\ninto each other's territory. The casualties of war and the ravages of\r\ninfectious diseases had long prior to the beginning of the present\r\ncentury rendered the Catawbas insignificant in numbers and importance.\r\nTheir territorial possessions had been curtailed to a tract of some\r\nfifteen miles square on the Catawba River, on the northern border of\r\nSouth Carolina, and the whites of the surrounding region were generally\r\ndesirous of seeing them removed from the State.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance therefore of the provisions of the act of 1848 an effort\r\nwas made by the authorities of the United States to find a home for\r\nthem west of the Mississippi River. Correspondence was opened with\r\nthe Cherokee authorities on the subject during the summer of that\r\nyear, but the Cherokees being unwilling to devote any portion of their\r\ndomain to the use and occupation of any other tribe without being fully\r\ncompensated therefor, the subject was dropped.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF THE CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nUnusual expenditures are always incident to the removal and\r\nestablishment of a people in an entirely new country. Domestic\r\ndissensions and violence of a widespread character have a tendency\r\nto destroy the security of life and property usually felt in a well\r\ngoverned community, and insecurity in this manner becomes the parent of\r\nidleness and the destroyer of ambition.\r\n\r\nThus from a combination of adverse circumstances the Cherokees since\r\ntheir removal had been subjected to many losses of both an individual\r\nand a national character. Their debts had come to be very oppressive,\r\nand they were anxiously devising methods of relief.\r\n\r\n_Proposed cession of the \"neutral land.\"_--At length in the fall of\r\n1852 they began to discuss the propriety of retroceding to the United\r\nStates the tract of 800,000 acres of additional land purchased by\r\nthem from the Government under the provisions of the treaty of 1835.\r\nThis tract was commonly known as the \"neutral land,\" and occupied the\r\nsoutheast corner of what is now the State of Kansas.\r\n\r\nIt was segregated from the main portion of their territory, and had\r\nnever been occupied by any considerable number of their people. After a\r\nfull discussion of the subject in their national council it was decided\r\nto ask the United States to purchase it, and a delegation was appointed\r\nto enter into negotiations on the subject. They submitted their\r\nproposition in two communications,[540] but after due consideration it\r\nwas decided by the Secretary of the Interior[541] to be inexpedient\r\nfor the Government to entertain the idea of purchase at that time.\r\nThereupon, under instructions from their national council, they\r\nwithdrew the proposition.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Cherokees resident in North Carolina and the neighboring\r\nStates learned of this proposed disposition of the \"neutral land\" they\r\nfiled a protest[542] against any sale of it that did not make full\r\nprovision for securing to them a proportional share of the proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMURDER OF THE ADAIRS AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\nIn September of this year occurred another of those sudden acts of\r\nviolence which had too frequently marked the history of the Cherokee\r\npeople during the preceding fifteen years. Superintendent Drew first\r\nreported[543] to the Indian Office that a mob of one hundred armed men\r\nhad murdered two unoffending citizens, Andrew and Washington Adair;\r\nthat not less than two hundred men were in armed resistance to the\r\nauthorities of the nation, who were unable or disinclined to suppress\r\nthe insurrection, and that from sixty to one hundred of the best-known\r\nfriends of the Adairs had been threatened with a fate similar to\r\ntheirs. The presence and protection of an additional force of United\r\nStates troops was therefore asked to preserve order in the Cherokee\r\ncountry and to allay the fears of the settlers along the border of\r\nArkansas.\r\n\r\nAn additional United States force was accordingly dispatched, but\r\nthe Cherokee authorities found little difficulty in controlling and\r\nallaying the excitement and disorder without their aid. In truth,\r\nthe first report had been in large measure sensational, the facts\r\nas reported by Agent Butler some two months later[544] being that\r\nthe murder was occasioned by a purely personal difficulty and had no\r\nconnection with any of the bitter political animosities that had cursed\r\nthe nation for so many years. It seems that several years previous to\r\nthe murder a Cherokee by the name of Proctor and one of the Adairs had\r\na difficulty. Adair's friends took Proctor a prisoner through false\r\npretenses and murdered him while in their hands. Proctor's friends in\r\nconsequence were much enraged and made violent threats of retaliation.\r\nIn fact during the period immediately following Proctor's death several\r\nother persons had been killed in consequence of the existing feud. The\r\nmurder of the Adairs was the culmination of their enemies' revenge.\r\nThe murderers were arrested, tried, and acquitted by the Cherokee\r\ncourts.[545]\r\n\r\n\r\nFINANCIAL DISTRESSES--NEW TREATY PROPOSED.\r\n\r\nThe year 1854 was in an unusual degree a period of quiet and\r\ncomparative freedom from internal dissensions among the Cherokees.\r\nTheir government was, however, still in an embarrassed financial\r\ncondition. Their national debt was constantly increasing, and they\r\npossessed no revenue aside from the small income derived from the\r\ninterest on their invested funds in the hands of the United States.\r\n\r\nFor a while, following the payment of their per capita money, they\r\nwere in the enjoyment of plenty, but with the natural improvidence of\r\na somewhat primitive people, their substance was wasted and no lasting\r\nbenefits were derived therefrom. To add to their embarrassments, a\r\nsevere drought throughout the summer resulted in an almost total\r\nfailure of their crops. Distress and starvation seemed to be staring\r\nthem in the face. Their schools, in which they had taken much\r\ncommendable pride, were languishing for want of the funds necessary to\r\ntheir support, and the general outlook was anything but cheerful.[546]\r\n\r\nIn this dilemma a delegation was sent to Washington with authority and\r\ninstructions to negotiate, if possible, another treaty with the United\r\nStates, based upon the following conditions:[547]\r\n\r\n1. The Cherokees to retrocede to the United States the 800,000 acre\r\ntract of \"neutral land\" at the price of $1.25 per acre, as a measure of\r\nrelief from their public debt burdens and to replenish their exhausted\r\nschool fund.\r\n\r\n2. To cede to the United States the unsold portion of the\r\n12-mile-square school fund tract in Alabama, set apart by the treaty of\r\n1819, also at $1.25 per acre, together with the other small reserves in\r\nTennessee set apart for the same purpose and by the same treaty, for\r\nwhich latter tracts they should receive $20,000.\r\n\r\n3. The United States to compensate the Cherokees living on the 800,000\r\nacre tract for the value of their improvements.\r\n\r\n4. The United States to rectify the injustice done to many individual\r\nCherokees in regard to their claims under the treaty of 1835.\r\n\r\n5. The United States to compensate the Cherokees for damages sustained\r\nthrough the action of citizens of the former in driving and pasturing\r\nstock in the Cherokee country, and to provide effectual measures for\r\nthe prevention of such losses in the future.\r\n\r\n6. The United States to cause a careful investigation to be made as\r\nto the status of the Cherokee invested fund and to render an account of\r\nthe accrued and unpaid interest thereon.\r\n\r\n7. The Cherokees to be reimbursed for money expended out of their\r\nfunds for subsistence after the expiration of the period of \"one year\"\r\nprovided by the treaty of 1835, but before their people had opportunity\r\nto become settled in their new homes.\r\n\r\n8. A just compensation to be made to the Cherokees for the heavy losses\r\nsustained in their sudden and forced removal from their Eastern home.\r\n\r\n9. An absolute and speedy removal of the garrison at Fort Gibson.\r\n\r\n10. That the treaty should contain a clear and specific definition of\r\nthe rights and status of the Cherokee Nation in its political attitude\r\ntoward and relations with the United States.\r\n\r\nThe proposed treaty formed the subject of much careful consideration,\r\nand negotiations were conducted throughout a large portion of the\r\nwinter, without, however, reaching satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the delegation to secure definite action on these\r\nmatters caused a great degree of dissatisfaction among all classes of\r\ntheir people.[548] They were anxious to sell their surplus detached\r\nland, and by that means free themselves from financial embarrassment.\r\nThey were fully conscious that, so long as their financial affairs\r\ncontinued in such a crippled condition, there was little ground for\r\na hopeful advancement in their morals or civilization. A traditional\r\nprejudice against the policy of parting with any of their public\r\ndomain was deep seated and well nigh universal among the Cherokees,\r\nbut so grinding and irksome had the burdens of their pecuniary\r\nresponsibilities become and so anxious were they to discharge in good\r\nfaith their duty to their creditors that this feeling of aversion was\r\nsubordinated to what was believed to be a national necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLAVERY IN THE CHEROKEE NATION.\r\n\r\nThe reports of the Cherokee agent during the year 1855 devote\r\nconsiderable space to the discussion of the slavery question in\r\nits relations to and among that nation, from which it appears that\r\nconsiderable local excitement, as well as a general feeling of\r\nirritation and insecurity among the holders of slave property, had been\r\nsuperinduced by the antislavery teachings of the Northern missionaries\r\nand emissaries of the various free soil organizations throughout the\r\nNorth. Three years later the agent reported that the amicable relations\r\nwhich existed between the Cherokees and the General Government\r\ncertainly merited the latter's fostering care and protection, for\r\nalready they were evincing much interest in all questions that\r\nconcerned its welfare; that the majority of them were strongly national\r\nor democratic in political sympathy, though it was with regret he\r\nwas obliged to report the existence of a few black republicans,\r\nwho were the particular foundlings of the abolition missionaries.\r\nThis same agent the following year (1859), after commending their\r\nenterprise and thrift, remarks: \"I am clearly of the opinion that the\r\nrapid advancement of the Cherokees is owing in part to the fact of\r\ntheir being slaveholders, which has operated as an incentive to all\r\nindustrial pursuits, and I believe if every family of the wild roving\r\ntribes of Indians were to own a negro man and woman, who would teach\r\nthem to cultivate the soil and to properly prepare and cook their\r\nfood, and could have a schoolmaster appointed for every district, it\r\nwould tend more to civilize them than any plan that could be adopted.\"\r\nThe latter part of this proposition perhaps no one would be willing\r\nto dispute, but in the light of twenty-five years of eventful history\r\nmade since its promulgation, the author himself, if still living, would\r\nscarcely be so \"clearly of opinion\" concerning the soundness of his\r\nfirst assumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF WHITE SETTLERS ON CHEROKEE LAND.\r\n\r\nThe year 1856 was characterized by no event in the official history of\r\nthe Cherokees of special importance, except, perhaps, the expulsion of\r\nwhite settlers who had intruded upon the \"neutral lands,\" in which the\r\naid of the military forces of the United States was invoked.\r\n\r\n\r\nFORT GIBSON ABANDONED BY THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe long and urgent demands of the Cherokees for the withdrawal of the\r\ngarrison of United States troops at Fort Gibson was at length complied\r\nwith in the year 1857,[549] and under the terms of the third article\r\nof the treaty of 1835 the fort and the military reserve surrounding\r\nit reverted to and became a part of the Cherokee national domain. In\r\nhis annual message of that year to the Cherokee council John Ross,\r\ntheir principal chief, recommended the passage of a law which should\r\nauthorize the site of the post to be laid off into town lots and sold\r\nto citizens for the benefit of the nation, reserving such lots and\r\nbuildings as seemed desirable for future disposition, and providing\r\nfor the suitable preservation of the burying-grounds in which, among\r\nothers, reposed the remains of several officers of the United States\r\nArmy. This recommendation was favorably acted upon by the council, and\r\ntown lots sold exclusively to the citizens of the nation brought the\r\nsum of $20,000.[550]\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF TRESPASSERS ON \"NEUTRAL LAND.\"\r\n\r\nWhite settlers having for several years preceding, in defiance of\r\nthe notification and authority of the General Government, continued\r\ntheir encroachments and settlement on the \"Cherokee neutral land,\"\r\nand the Cherokee authorities having made repeated complaints of these\r\nunauthorized intrusions, measures were taken to remove the cause of\r\ncomplaint. Notice was therefore given to these settlers in the winter\r\nof 1859, requiring them to abandon the lands, by the 1st of April\r\nfollowing. No attention was paid to the notice, but the settlers went\r\non and planted their crops as usual. The newly appointed Cherokee\r\nagent, having failed to reach his agency until late in the spring,\r\nproceeded to the neutral land in August, and again notified the\r\ntrespassers to remove within thirty-five days. To this they paid no\r\nmore heed than to the first notification. Some two months later,[551]\r\ntherefore, the agent, accompanied by a detachment of United States\r\ndragoons, under command of Captain Stanley, marched into the midst of\r\nthe settlers and again commanded their immediate removal. Upon their\r\nrefusal to comply he adopted the plan of firing their cabins, which\r\nsoon brought them to terms. They proposed that if he would desist in\r\nhis forcible measures and withdraw the troops, they would quietly\r\nremove on or before the 25th of November, unless in the mean time they\r\nshould receive the permission of the Government to remain during the\r\nwinter. This the agent agreed to, and subsequently the permission was\r\ngranted them to so remain.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this subject it appears from the records of the\r\nDepartment that owing to an error in protracting the northern boundary\r\nof the \"neutral land,\" the line was made to run 8 or 9 miles south of\r\nthe true boundary, leaving outside of the reserve as it was marked\r\non the map, a strip known as the \"dry woods,\" which should have been\r\nincluded in it; it was generally believed that the \"dry woods\" was a\r\npart of the New York Indian reservation, on which settlements were\r\npermitted, and as the settlers on that particular portion had gone\r\nthere in good faith the agent did not molest them.[552] The Secretary\r\nof the Interior himself expressed the opinion that the \"dry woods\"\r\nsettlers were law abiding citizens and had settled there under a\r\nmisapprehension of the facts, and that as they had expended large sums\r\nin opening and improving their farms it would be a great hardship\r\nif they should be compelled to remove. He therefore suspended the\r\nexecution of the law as to them until the approaching session of\r\nCongress, in order that they might have an opportunity of applying\r\nto that body for relief. The Cherokees it was well known were anxious\r\nto dispose of the land, and the Secretary declared his intention of\r\nrecommending the passage of a law with their consent, providing for the\r\nsurvey and sale of the \"neutral lands,\" after the manner of disposing\r\nof the public lands, the proceeds to be applied to the benefit of the\r\nCherokees. The outbreak of the great rebellion so soon thereafter,\r\nhowever, precluded the consummation of this proposed legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN ROSS OPPOSES SURVEY AND ALLOTMENT OF CHEROKEE DOMAIN.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1859-'60, the Commissioner of Indian Affairs,\r\nbelieving that a survey and subdivision of the Cherokee national\r\ndomain, and its allotment in severalty among the members of the tribe,\r\nwould produce an effect favorable to their progress in the cultivation\r\nof the soil, submitted the suggestion for the consideration of their\r\nlawfully constituted authorities. John Ross, as principal chief of the\r\nnation, in replying to this suggestion,[553] declined on behalf of the\r\nnation to give it favorable consideration, (1) because it conflicted\r\nwith the general policy of the Government through which the Cherokees\r\nwere removed from their homes east of the Mississippi River; (2)\r\nbecause it was inconsistent with existing treaties between the United\r\nStates and the Cherokee Nation; (3) because it could not be done\r\nwithout a change in the constitution of the nation; and, finally, that\r\nit would not be beneficial to the Cherokee people.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL EXCITEMENT IN 1860.\r\n\r\nThe year 1860 was characterized by great excitement and local\r\ndisturbances. Many affrays occurred and numerous murders were\r\nperpetrated. The excitement and bitterness of feeling involved in the\r\nissues at stake between the great political parties of the country in\r\nthe pending Presidential election extended to and pervaded the entire\r\npopulation of the civilized tribes of Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nThey were many of them slaveholders, especially the half-breeds and\r\nmixed bloods. They therefore vehemently resented the introduction\r\nand dissemination of any doctrines at variance with the dogma of the\r\ndivine origin of slavery or that should set up any denial of the\r\nmoral and legal right of the owner to the continued possession of\r\nhis slave property. The missionaries and many of the school teachers\r\namong the Cherokees were persons of strong anti-slavery convictions,\r\nand the former especially were zealous in their dissemination of\r\ndoctrines fatal alike to the peace and endurance of a slave community.\r\nIn September John B. Jones, a Baptist missionary, who had devoted\r\nmuch of his life to Christian work among the Indians, was notified\r\nby the agent to leave the country within three weeks, because of the\r\npublication of an article from his pen in a Northern paper, wherein he\r\nstated that he was engaged in promulgating anti-slavery sentiments\r\namong his flock.[554] Others were in like manner compelled to leave,\r\nand the excitement continued to increase daily until the outbreak of\r\nhostilities precipitated by the attack on Fort Sumter.\r\n\r\nBefore the actual outbreak of hostilities, in the winter of 1860,\r\nadherents of the Southern cause, among the most effectual and\r\ninfluential of whom were the official agents of the United States\r\naccredited to the Indian tribes, were active in propagating the\r\ndoctrines of secession among the Cherokees, as well as among other\r\ntribes of the Indian Territory. Secret societies were organized,\r\nespecially among the Cherokees, and Stand Watie, the recognized leader\r\nof the old Ridge or Treaty party, was the leader of an organization of\r\nSouthern predilections known as the Knights of the Golden Circle. A\r\ncounter organization was formed from among the loyally inclined portion\r\nof the nation, most, if not all, of whom were members of the Government\r\nor Ross party. The membership of this latter society was composed\r\nprincipally of full blood Cherokees, and they termed themselves the\r\n\"Ki-tu-wha,\" a name by which the Cherokees were said to have been known\r\nin their ancient confederations with other Indian tribes.[555] The\r\ndistinguishing badge of membership in this association was a pin worn\r\nin a certain position on the coat, vest, or hunting shirt, from whence\r\nmembers were given the designation in common parlance of \"Pin\" Indians.\r\nAccording to the statement of General Albert Pike, however (and I think\r\nhe gives the correct version), this \"Pin\" society was organized and in\r\nfull operation long before the beginning of the secession difficulties,\r\nand was really established for the purpose of depriving the half-breeds\r\nof all political power.[556] Be this as it may, however, the society\r\nwas made to represent in the incipient stages of the great American\r\nconflict the element of opposition to an association with the Southern\r\nConfederacy and on one occasion it prevented the distinctively Southern\r\nelement under the leadership of Stand Watie from raising a Confederate\r\nflag at Tahlequah.[557] It was also alleged to have been established by\r\nthe Rev. Evan Jones, a missionary of more than forty years' standing\r\namong the Cherokees, as an instrument for the dissemination of\r\nanti-slavery doctrines.[558]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEES AND THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1861, General Albert Pike, of Arkansas, was requested by Hon.\r\nRobert Toombs, secretary of state of the Confederate States, to visit\r\nthe Indian Territory as a commissioner, and to assure the Indians\r\nof the friendship of those States. He proceeded to Fort Smith,[559]\r\nwhere, in company with General Benjamin McCulloch, he was waited on by\r\na delegation of Cherokees representing the element of that people who\r\nwere enthusiastically loyal to the Confederacy and who were desirous of\r\nascertaining whether in case they would organize and take up arms for\r\nthe South the latter would engage to protect them from the hostility\r\nof John Ross and the association of \"Pin\" Indians who were controlled\r\nby him.[560] Assurances were given of the desired protection, and\r\nmessengers were sent to a number of the prominent leaders of the\r\nanti-Ross party to meet General Pike at the Creek Agency, two days\r\nafter he should have held an interview with Ross, then contemplated,\r\nat Park Hill. General Pike, as he alleges, had no idea of concluding\r\nany terms with Ross, and his intention was to treat with the leaders of\r\nthe Southern party at the Creek Agency. At the meeting held with Ross\r\nat Park Hill, the latter refused to enter into any arrangement with\r\nthe Confederate Government, and obstinately insisted on maintaining an\r\nattitude of strict neutrality. After vainly endeavoring to shake the\r\nold man's purpose, General McCulloch at length agreed to respect his\r\nneutrality so long as the Federal forces should refrain from entering\r\nthe Cherokee country.[561]\r\n\r\nGeneral McCulloch having been ordered by the Confederate authorities to\r\ntake command of the district of country embracing the Indian Territory,\r\nwith headquarters at Fort Smith, addressed[562] a communication to John\r\nRoss again assuring him of his intention to respect the neutrality\r\nof the Cherokee people, except that all those members of the tribe\r\nwho should so desire must be permitted to enlist in the Confederate\r\narmy, without interference or molestation, for purposes of defense\r\nin case of an invasion from the North. To this Ross replied,[563]\r\nreasserting the determination of the Cherokees to maintain a strict\r\nneutrality between the contending parties. He refused his consent to\r\nany organization or enlistment of Cherokee troops into the Confederate\r\nservice, for the reason, first, it would be a palpable violation of the\r\nCherokee position of neutrality, and, second, it would place in their\r\nmidst organized companies not authorized by the Cherokee laws, but in\r\nviolation of treaty, and which would soon become effective instruments\r\nin stirring up domestic strife and creating internal difficulties among\r\nthe Cherokee people. General McCulloch in his letter had assumed that\r\nhis proposition for permitting enlistments of Cherokees of Confederate\r\nsympathies was in accordance with the views expressed to him by Ross\r\nin an interview occurring some eight or ten days previous, wherein\r\nthe latter had observed that in case of an invasion from the North\r\nhe himself would lead the Cherokees to repel it. Ross, in his reply\r\nabove alluded to, takes occasion to assure McCulloch that the latter\r\nhad misapprehended his language. It was only in case of a foreign\r\ninvasion that he had offered to lead his men in repelling it. He had\r\nnot signified any purpose as to an invasion by either the Northern or\r\nSouthern forces, because he had not apprehended and could not give his\r\nconsent to any.\r\n\r\nSome time in August[564] a convention was assembled at Tahlequah upon\r\nthe call of John Ross, to take into consideration the question of\r\nthe difficulties and dangers surrounding the Cherokee Nation and to\r\ndetermine the most advisable method of procedure. At this convention\r\na number of speeches were made, all of which were bitterly hostile\r\nin tone to the United States and favorable to an open alliance with\r\nthe Southern Confederacy. Ross, among others, gave free expression\r\nto his views, and according to the published version of his remarks\r\ngave it as his opinion that an understanding with the Confederacy was\r\nthe best thing for the Cherokees and all other Indians to secure and\r\nthat without delay; that, as for himself, he was and always had been a\r\nSouthern man, a State rights man; born in the South, and a slaveholder;\r\nthat the South was fighting for its rights against the oppressions\r\nof the North, and that the true position of the Indians was with the\r\nSouthern people. After this speech the convention, which was attended\r\nby four thousand male Cherokees, adopted without a dissenting voice a\r\nresolution to abandon their relations with the United States and to\r\nform an alliance with the Confederacy.\r\n\r\n_Treaties between Confederate States and various Southern\r\ntribes._--General Pike did not see Ross again until September.[565]\r\nIn the meantime, the latter had secured the attendance of a large\r\nnumber of representatives of both Northern and Southern tribes, at a\r\nconvocation held at Antelope Hills, where a unanimous agreement was\r\nreached to maintain a strict neutrality in the existing hostilities\r\nbetween their white neighbors. The alleged purpose of this assembly,\r\nas stated by General Pike, was to take advantage of the war between\r\nthe States, and form a great independent Indian confederation, but he\r\ndefeated its purpose by concluding a treaty with the Creeks on behalf\r\nof the Confederate States, while their delegates were actually engaged\r\nin council at the Antelope Hills. Following his negotiations with the\r\nCreeks, he concluded treaties in quick succession with the Choctaws\r\nand Chickasaws, the Seminoles, the Wichitas, and affiliated tribes,\r\nincluding the absentee Shawnees and Delawares, and the Comanches.[566]\r\nOn returning from his treaty with the Comanches, he was met before\r\nreaching Fort Arbuckle by a messenger bearing a letter from Ross and\r\nhis council, accompanied by a copy of the resolutions of the council\r\nand a pressing personal invitation to repair to the Cherokee country\r\nand enter into a treaty with that tribe. He consented and named a\r\nday when he would meet Ross, at the same time writing the latter to\r\nnotify the Osages, Quapaws, Senecas, and the confederated Senecas and\r\nShawnees, to meet him at the same time. At the time fixed he proceeded\r\nto Park Hill (Ross's residence), where he concluded treaties with these\r\nvarious tribes[567] during the first week in October, reserving the\r\nnegotiations with the Cherokees to the last, the treaty with whom was\r\nconcluded on the 7th of the month at Tahlequah. This instrument was\r\nvery lengthy, being comprised in fifty-five articles.[568] The preamble\r\nset forth that--\r\n\r\n    The Congress of the Confederate States of America having, by\r\n    an \"Act for the protection of certain Indian tribes,\" approved the\r\n    21st day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred\r\n    and sixty-one, offered to assume and accept the protectorate of\r\n    the several nations and tribes of Indians occupying the country\r\n    west of Arkansas and Missouri, and to recognize them as their\r\n    wards, subject to all the rights, privileges, immunities, titles\r\n    and guarantees with each of said nations and tribes under treaties\r\n    made with them by the United States of America; and the Cherokee\r\n    Nation of Indians having assented thereto upon certain terms and\r\n    conditions: Now, therefore, the said Confederate States of America,\r\n    by Albert Pike, their commissioner, constituted by the President,\r\n    under authority of the act of Congress, in that behalf, with\r\n    plenary powers for these purposes, and the Cherokee Nation by the\r\n    principal chief, executive council, and commissioners aforesaid,\r\n    has agreed to the following articles, etc.\r\n\r\nWith some slight amendments to the instrument as originally concluded\r\nit was duly ratified by the Confederate States.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEROKEE TROOPS FOR THE CONFEDERATE ARMY.\r\n\r\nLong before[569] the conclusion of this treaty, authority was given by\r\nGeneral McCulloch to raise a battalion of Cherokees for the service\r\nof the Confederate States. Under this authority a regiment was raised\r\nin December, 1861, and commanded by Stand Watie, the leader of the\r\nanti-Ross party. A regiment had also been previously raised, ostensibly\r\nas home guards, the officers of which had been appointed by Chief Ross\r\nand the command assigned to Colonel Drew.[570] After the conclusion\r\nof the treaty this regiment was also placed at the service of the\r\nConfederate States, and in December[571] following, in an address to\r\nthem, Ross remarked that he had raised the regiment \"to act in concert\r\nwith the troops of the Southern Confederacy.\"\r\n\r\nThese two regiments actively participated and co-operated in the\r\nmilitary operations of the Confederates until after the battle of Pea\r\nRidge, in which they were engaged.[572] In the summer of 1862,[573]\r\nfollowing this battle, Colonel Weir, of the United States Army,\r\ncommanding a force partly composed of loyal Indians on the northern\r\nborder of the Cherokee country, sent a proposition to John Ross\r\nurging that the Cherokees should repudiate their treaty with the\r\nConfederacy and return to their former relations with the United\r\nStates, offering at the same time a safe conduct to Ross and such\r\nof his leading counselors as he should designate through the Union\r\nlines to Washington, where they could negotiate a new treaty with\r\nthe authorities of the United States. This proposition was declined\r\nperemptorily by Ross, who declared that the Cherokees disdained an\r\nalliance with a people who had authorized and practiced the most\r\nmonstrous barbarities in violation of the laws of war; that the\r\nCherokees were bound to the Confederate States by the faith of treaty\r\nobligations and by a community of sentiment and interest; that they\r\nwere born upon the soil of the South and would stand or fall with the\r\nStates of the South.[574]\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHEROKEE CONFEDERATE REGIMENT DESERTS TO THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nColonel Drew's regiment of Cherokees had now been in the Confederate\r\nservice about ten months. During that period they had remained unpaid,\r\nwere scantily clothed, and were generally uncared for, unthanked, and\r\ntheir services unrecognized.[575] When, therefore, Colonel Weir invaded\r\nthe Cherokee country in July, 1862, and the power and prestige of the\r\nConfederacy seemed, for the time being, to have become less potent in\r\nthat region, their troops having been withdrawn to other localities,\r\nthese discontented and unfed Cherokee soldiers found themselves in\r\na condition ripe for revolt. Almost _en masse_, they abandoned the\r\nConfederate service and enlisted in that of the United States.\r\n\r\n_Conduct of John Ross._--Ross, finding that he had been abandoned by\r\nDrew's regiment, concluded to make a virtue of necessity and become\r\na loyal man too, with the shrewd assertion that such had always been\r\nthe true impulse of his heart; he had been overborne, however, by the\r\nauthority and power of the Confederate Government and felt constrained\r\nto save his people and their material interests from total destruction\r\nby dissembling before the officials of that Government, seeking only\r\nthe first opportunity, which he had now embraced, to return with\r\nhis people to the fealty they so delighted to bear to the Federal\r\nGovernment.[576] He was escorted out of the Cherokee country by Colonel\r\nWeir's regiment and did not soon return. The burden of proof seems to\r\nbe almost, if not quite, conclusive against his pretensions to loyalty\r\nup to this period, and now that the opportunity he had so long desired\r\nof placing himself and his people within the protection of the United\r\nStates had arrived, instead of manifesting any of that activity which\r\nhad characterized his conduct in behalf of the Confederate States, he\r\nretired to Philadelphia, and did not return to his people for three\r\nyears.[577]\r\n\r\n_O-poth-le-yo-ho-lo and his loyal followers._--General Pike, in his\r\nletter to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs pending the negotiation of\r\nthe treaty of 1866, seeks to convey the impression that there were no\r\nactively loyal Indians among the Southern tribes during the incipient\r\nstages of the rebellion, and perhaps this is in large measure correct\r\nas to most of those tribes.\r\n\r\nTheir situation was such as would have worked confusion in the ideas\r\nof a less primitive and simple minded people. For years before the\r\noutbreak of the rebellion their superintendents, agents, and agency\r\nemployés had been, almost without exception, Southern men or men of\r\nSouthern sympathies. They were a slaveholding people, and the idea was\r\nconstantly pressed upon them that the pending difficulties between the\r\nNorth and the South were solely the result of a determination on the\r\npart of the latter to protect her slave property from the aggressions\r\nand rapacity of the former. When at last hostilities commenced,\r\nthey saw the magnitude of the preparation and the strength of the\r\nConfederate forces in their vicinity. The weakness of the Federal\r\nforces was equally striking. Within the scope of their limited horizon\r\nthere was naught that seemed to shed a ray of hope upon the rapidly\r\ndarkening sky of Federal supremacy. Those who were naturally inclined\r\nto sympathize with, and who retained a feeling of friendship and\r\nreverence for, the old Government were awed into silence. A sense of\r\nfear and helplessness for the time being compelled them to accept and\r\napparently acquiesce in a state of affairs for which many of them had\r\nno heart.\r\n\r\nAfter the Cherokee convention, at Tahlequah, in August, 1861, at which\r\nit was decided with such unanimity to renounce their treaty relations\r\nwith the United States and to enter into diplomatic alliance with the\r\nConfederacy, O-poth-le-yo-ho-lo, an old and prominent Creek chief, whom\r\nRoss had notified by letter of the action taken, and upon whom he urged\r\nthe wisdom of securing similar action by the Creeks,[578] refused to\r\nlend himself to any such measure. He called a council of the Creeks,\r\nhowever, representing to them the action of the Cherokees, alleging\r\nthat their chiefs had been bought, and reminded the Creeks of the\r\nduties and obligations by which they were bound to the Government of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the Creeks, notwithstanding, were for active\r\nco-operation with the Confederacy, and an internecine war was at once\r\ninaugurated. The loyal portion of the Seminoles, Wichitas, Kickapoos,\r\nand Delawares joined O-poth-le-yo-ho-lo and his loyal Creeks, who after\r\ntwo or three engagements with the disloyal Indians, backed by a force\r\nof Texas troops, was compelled to retreat to the north, which he did\r\nin December, 1861.[579] The weather was extremely inclement; the loyal\r\nIndians were burdened with all their household goods, their women\r\nand children, and at the same time exposed to the assaults of their\r\nenemies. Their baggage was captured, leaving many of them without shoes\r\nor comfortable clothing. Hundreds perished on the route, and at last,\r\nafter a journey of 300 miles, they reached Humboldt, Kansas, racked\r\nwith disease, almost frozen, and with starvation staring them in the\r\nface. Immediately upon learning of the condition of these sufferers,\r\nIndian Superintendent Coffin promptly inaugurated measures for their\r\nrelief. Having inconsiderable funds at his command for the purpose,\r\napplication was made to General Hunter, commanding the Department of\r\nKansas, who promptly responded with all the supplies at his disposal.\r\nThe Indians in their retreat had become scattered over an area of\r\nterritory 200 miles in extent, between the Verdigris and Fall River,\r\nWalnut Creek and the Arkansas. As they became aware of the efforts of\r\nthe Government for their relief, they began to pour into the camp of\r\nrendezvous on the Verdigris, but were later removed to Le Roy, Kansas.\r\nAuthority was given to enlist the able bodied males in the service of\r\nthe United States, and two regiments were at once organized and placed\r\nunder command of Colonel Weir for an expedition against the Indian\r\nTerritory, mention of which has been previously made. A census taken\r\nof these refugees by Superintendent Coffin, in August, 1862, showed\r\nthat there were in camp, exclusive of the 2,000 who had enlisted in\r\nthe service of the United States, 3,619 Creeks, 919 Seminoles, 165\r\nChickasaws, 223 Cherokees, 400 Kickapoos, 89 Delawares, 19 Ionies, and\r\n53 Keechies, in all 5,487, consisting of 864 men, 2,040 women, and\r\n2,583 children. In addition to these at least 15 per cent. had died\r\nsince their arrival from hardships encountered in the course of their\r\nretreat. They were subsequently removed to the Sac and Fox reservation\r\nin Kansas.\r\n\r\nUntil after Colonel Weir's expedition to the Indian Territory not\r\nexceeding three hundred Cherokees had taken refuge within the Union\r\nlines; but in the autumn of 1862, after Weir's retreat, a body of\r\nrefugees, mostly women and children, claiming the protection of the\r\nUnited States, made their way to a point on the Cherokee neutral lands\r\nsome 12 miles south of Fort Scott, Kansas.\r\n\r\nLike all the other refugees, they were in a most destitute and\r\nsuffering condition. In need of food, clothing, and supplies of all\r\nkinds, these sufferers, to the number of two thousand, appealed for\r\nrelief, and were for a time supplied by the Superintendent of Indian\r\nAffairs, but afterwards, on being taken under charge of the military\r\nauthorities, were transferred to Neosho, Missouri.\r\n\r\n_Relations with the Southern Confederacy renounced._--During the month\r\nof February, 1863 (as reported[580] by John Ross from Philadelphia),\r\na special meeting of the Cherokee national council was convened at\r\nCowskin Prairie, and the following legislation was enacted:\r\n\r\n1. Abrogating the treaty with the Confederate States, and calling a\r\ngeneral convention of the people to approve the act.\r\n\r\n2. The appointment of a delegation with suitable powers and\r\ninstructions to represent the Cherokee Nation before the United\r\nStates Government, consisting of John Ross, principal chief,\r\nLieutenant-Colonel Downing, Capt. James McDaniel, and Rev. Evan Jones.\r\n\r\n3. Authorizing a general Indian council to be held at such time and\r\nplace as the principal chief may designate.\r\n\r\n4. Deposing all officers of the nation disloyal to the Government.\r\n\r\n5. Approving the purchase of supplies made by the treasurer and\r\ndirecting their distribution.\r\n\r\n6. Providing for the abolition of slavery in the Cherokee Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAVAGES OF WAR IN THE CHEROKEE NATION.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the winter of 1862 and early spring of 1863\r\nthe military authorities conceived the propriety of returning the\r\nrefugee Cherokees to their homes in time to enable them to plant their\r\nspring crops. Two military expeditions were organized, one to move\r\nfrom Springfield, Mo., under the command of General Blunt, and the\r\nother from Scott's Mills, in charge of Colonel Phillips.[581] The\r\nIndians were furnished with the necessary agricultural implements,\r\nseeds, etc., and were promised complete protection from the incursions\r\nof their enemies. The refugees, in charge of Indian Agent Harlan,\r\nset out for their homes a week after the army had marched, reaching\r\nTahlequah in safety, and immediately scattering themselves throughout\r\nthe country engaged busily in planting their crops. Their labors had\r\nonly fairly commenced when they were alarmed by the reported approach\r\nof Stand Watie and his regiment of Confederate Cherokees. The Indians\r\nimmediately suspended their labors, and, together with the troops under\r\nColonel Phillips, were compelled to take refuge in Fort Gibson. Their\r\nnumbers were, as reported by the superintendent, now increased to\r\nupwards of six thousand, by the addition of many who, up to this time,\r\nhad remained at their homes. The troops of Stand Watie, alleged to\r\nnumber some seven hundred, scoured the country at their pleasure, and\r\nnot only everything of value that had previously escaped confiscation\r\nin the nation, but everything that had been brought back with them by\r\nthe refugees to aid in their proposed labors, was either carried off\r\nor destroyed. The failure of these expeditions in accomplishing the\r\nobjects for which they were organized rendered it necessary that the\r\nrefugees should be fed and maintained at Fort Gibson, some 200 miles\r\ndistant from the base of supplies. This situation of affairs remained\r\npractically unchanged until the close of the war, except that the\r\nnumber of destitute Indians requiring subsistence from the Government\r\nincreased to sixteen or seventeen thousand. The United States forces\r\ncontinued to occupy Forts Smith and Gibson, and the Indians were\r\nthus enabled to cultivate, to a limited extent, the lands within the\r\nimmediate protection of those posts, but their country was infested\r\nand overrun by guerrillas, who preyed upon and destroyed everything\r\nof a destructible character. There was no portion of country within\r\nthe limits of the United States, perhaps, that was better suited to\r\nthe demands of stock-raising, and the Cherokees had, prior to the\r\nwar, entered largely into this pursuit. Many of them were wealthy and\r\nnumbered their herds by hundreds and even thousands of head. Almost\r\nthe entire nation was surrounded by all the comforts and many of the\r\nluxuries of a civilized people. When they were overwhelmed by the\r\ndisasters of war, and saw the labors and accumulations of more than\r\ntwenty years' residence in that pleasant and fruitful country swept\r\naway in a few weeks, the sullen bitterness of despair settled down upon\r\nthem. Their losses in stock alone aggregated, according to the best\r\nestimates, more than 300,000 head. Is it any wonder that the springs of\r\nhope should dry up within their breasts?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 475: United States Statute at Large, Vol. IX, p. 871.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 476: May 6, 1844.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 477: May 30, 1844.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 478: Letter of Secretary of War to Commissioners Jones and\r\nButler, October 18, 1844.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 479: October 18, 1844.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 480: Letter of General Jones to Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs, November 17, 1844.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 481: He was one of the chiefs of the Arkansas delegation who\r\nsigned the treaty of May 6, 1828.

That if allowable in any sense, the Government had no right to take\r\nfrom the Cherokee fund an expense for removal greater than the limit\r\nfixed by the eighth article of the treaty of 1835.\r\n\r\n3. That the alternative of receiving for subsistence $33.33, as\r\nprovided for in the treaty of 1835, was refused to be complied with and\r\ntheir people forced to receive rations in kind at double the cost.\r\n\r\n4.

As the result of this reference\r\nan award was made which showed that there was due from Thomas to\r\nJohnston upon three several judgments the sum of $33,887.11. Upon this\r\nsum, however, credits to the amount of $15,552.11 (including the $6,500\r\nwith interest paid to Johnston by the Cherokees under contract of\r\nSeptember, 1869) were allowed, leaving the net amount due to Johnston\r\n$18,335, which sum he was entitled to collect with interest until\r\npaid, together with the costs taxed in the three judgments aforesaid.\r\nThe arbitrators further found that Johnson held sheriff's deeds for\r\nconsiderable tracts of land which had been sold as the property of\r\nThomas and which were not included among the lands held by him in\r\ntrust for the Indians. These tracts Johnston had bought in by reason\r\nof clouds upon the title and \"forbiddals\" of the sales at a merely\r\nnominal figure. It was therefore declared that these sheriffs' deeds\r\nshould be held by Johnston only as security for the payment of the\r\nbalance due him on the judgments in question and for the costs taxed\r\non each. It was further directed that Terrell and Johnston should make\r\nsale of so much of the lands embraced in the sheriff's deeds alluded to\r\n(excluding those awarded to the Cherokee Indians either as a tribe or\r\nas individuals) as would produce a sum sufficient to satisfy the above\r\nbalance of $18,335 with interest and costs.\r\n\r\nFollowing this award of the arbitrators Mr. Johnston submitted a\r\nproposition for the transfer and assignment of these judgments to the\r\nEastern Band of Cherokees. Based upon this offer, the Commissioner of\r\nIndian Affairs reported to the Secretary of the Interior June 2, 1875,\r\nthat the interests of the Indians required the acceptance of Johnston's\r\nproposition. This recommendation was confirmed by William Stickney,\r\nof the President's board of Indian commissioners, in a report to that\r\nbody. Mr. J. W. Terrell, on behalf of the Eastern Cherokees, as well\r\nas their agent, W. C. McCarthy, joined in urging the acceptance of the\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nSupported by these opinions and recommendations, the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, on the 3d of June, 1875, authorized the purchase of the\r\nJohnston judgments, and two days later a requisition was issued for\r\nthe money, and instructions were given to Agent McCarthy to make the\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\nUnder these instructions as subsequently modified (June 9, 1875),\r\nAgent McCarthy reported (July 27, 1875) the purchase of the\r\njudgments, amounting in the aggregate, including interest and costs,\r\nto $19,245.53, and an assignment of them was taken in the name of\r\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs in trust for the Eastern Band of\r\nCherokee Indians of North Carolina.\r\n\r\nFrom investigations and reports afterward made by Inspectors Watkins\r\nand Vandever, it appears that there was much uncertainty and confusion\r\nas to the actual status of these lands. The latter gentleman reported\r\n(April 10, 1876) that the second award made by the arbitrators was a\r\nprivate affair between Thomas and Johnston and was entirely separate\r\nand distinct from the first award in the case of the Indians. He also\r\nreported that, despite the purchase of the Johnston judgments by the\r\nIndian Department in trust for the Indians, the two commissioners\r\nnamed in the second award proceeded to sell the lands upon which these\r\njudgments were a lien, and at the November, 1875, term of the court\r\nmade a report of their proceedings, which was affirmed by the court.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration all these complications, it was recommended\r\nby Inspector Vandever that an agent or commission be appointed, if the\r\nsame could be done by consent of all parties, who should assume the\r\nduty of appraising the lands affected by the Johnston judgments, and\r\nthat such quantity of the lands be selected for the Cherokees as would\r\nat such appraisal equal in value the amount of the judgments, interest,\r\nand costs, after which the remainder of the lands, if any, should be\r\nreleased to Mr. Thomas. The representatives of Thomas and Johnston\r\nalso submitted a proposition for adjustment to the Indians, who by\r\nresolution of their council (March, 1876) agreed to accept it. In the\r\nlight of this action and of the recommendation of Inspector Vandever,\r\nCongress passed an act (August 14, 1876) authorizing the Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs to receive in payment of the amount due to the\r\nIndians on the Johnston judgments owned by them a sufficient quantity\r\nof the Thomas lands to satisfy, at the appraised value, the amount of\r\nsuch judgments, and to deed the lands thus accepted to the Eastern Band\r\nof Cherokees in fee simple.\r\n\r\nThe commissioner of appraisal appointed and acting under this act of\r\nCongress, and under the supervision of Inspector Watkins, selected\r\n15,211.2 acres, the appraised value of which was $20,561.35, being the\r\nexact amount, including interest and costs, due upon the judgments up\r\nto October 7, 1876, the date of appraisal.\r\n\r\nThereupon a deed (known as the Watkins deed) was executed by the\r\nparties representing the Johnston and Thomas interests, conveying the\r\nlands so selected to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs in the manner\r\ndirected by the act of Congress, which deed it was agreed should be\r\nsupplemented by a new one so soon as a more definite description could\r\nbe given of the lands after survey. The surveys were made by M. S.\r\nTemple, who also surveyed the Qualla boundary tract, a deed for which\r\nlatter tract (known as the Brooks deed) was executed direct to the\r\nEastern Band of North Carolina Cherokee Indians, and the supplemental\r\ndeed spoken of above was also executed. Sundry difficulties and\r\ncomplications have continued from time to time to arise in connection\r\nwith the affairs of these Indians, and as the most effective measure\r\nof protection to their interests the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\r\nhas suggested (April 26, 1882) to Congress the advisability of placing\r\nthe persons and property of these people under the jurisdiction of\r\nthe United States district court for the western district of North\r\nCarolina.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 540: February 17 and March 17, 1853.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 541: March 26, 1853.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 542: This protest bore date of November 9, 1853, and was\r\nfiled by Edwin Follin, as their attorney or representative.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 543: September 21, 1853.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 544: November 22, 1853.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 545: Letter of Agent Butler, dated November 30, 1853.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 546: Annual report of Agent Butler for 1854.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 547: The delegation submitted these propositions in a\r\ncommunication to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, dated December 28,\r\n1854.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 548: Annual report of Agent Butler for 1855.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 549: Annual report of Agent Butler for 1857.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 550: Annual report of Agent Butler for 1858.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 551: October 10, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 552: See reports of Agent Cowart in November, 1860, in Indian\r\nOffice report of 1860, pp. 224, 225.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 553: January 1, 1860.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 554: Letter of Agent R.

All Cherokees and freed persons who were formerly slaves to any\r\nCherokee, and all free negroes, not having been such slaves, who\r\nresided in the Cherokee Nation prior to June 1, 1861, who may within\r\ntwo years elect not to reside northeast of the Arkansas River and\r\nsoutheast of Grand River, shall have the right to settle in and occupy\r\nthe Canadian district southwest of the Arkansas River; and also the\r\ncountry northwest of Grand River, and bounded southeast by Grand River\r\nand west by the Creek country, to the northeast corner thereof; from\r\nthence west on north line of Creek country to 96° west longitude;\r\nthence north with said 96° so far that a line due east to Grand River\r\nwill include a quantity of land equal to 160 acres for each person who\r\nmay so elect to reside therein, provided that the part of said district\r\nnorth of Arkansas River shall not be set apart until the Canadian\r\ndistrict shall be found insufficient to allow 160 acres to each person\r\ndesiring to settle under the terms of this article.\r\n\r\n5. The inhabitants electing to reside in the district described in\r\nthe preceding article shall have the right to elect all their local\r\nofficers and judges, also their proportionate share of delegates in\r\nany general council that may be established under the twelfth article\r\nof this treaty; to control all their local affairs in a manner not\r\ninconsistent with the constitution of the Cherokee Nation or the\r\nlaws of the United States, provided the Cherokees residing in said\r\ndistrict shall enjoy all the rights and privileges of other Cherokees\r\nwho may elect to settle in said district as herein before provided,\r\nand shall hold the same rights and privileges and be subject to the\r\nsame liabilities as those who elect to settle in said district under\r\nthe provisions of this treaty; provided, also, that if any rules be\r\nadopted which, in the opinion of the President, bear oppressively on\r\nany citizen of the nation he may suspend the same.

A census shall be taken of each tribe in the Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nII. The first general council shall consist of one member for each\r\ntribe, and an additional member for each one thousand population or\r\nfraction thereof over five hundred. Any tribe failing to elect such\r\nmembers of council shall be represented by its chief or chiefs and\r\nheadmen in the above proportion.

All laws enacted by the council shall take effect\r\nas therein provided, unless suspended by the President of the United\r\nStates. No law shall be enacted inconsistent with the Constitution or\r\nlaws of the United States or with existing treaty stipulations. The\r\ncouncil shall not legislate upon matters other than above indicated,\r\nunless jurisdiction shall be enlarged by consent of the national\r\ncouncil of each nation or tribe, with the assent of the President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nIV. Said council shall be presided over by such person as may be\r\ndesignated by the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nV. The council shall elect a secretary, who shall receive from the\r\nUnited States an annual salary of $500.

If\r\nany tribe so settling shall abandon its tribal organization and pay\r\ninto the Cherokee national fund a sum bearing the same proportion to\r\nsuch fund as said tribe shall in numbers bear to the population of\r\nthe Cherokee Nation such tribe shall be incorporated into and ever\r\nafter remain a part of that nation on equal terms with native citizens\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\nIf any tribe so settling shall decide to preserve its tribal\r\norganization, laws, customs, and usages not inconsistent with the\r\nconstitution and laws of the Cherokee Nation, it shall have set apart\r\nin compact form for use and occupancy a tract equal to 160 acres\r\nfor each member of the tribe. Such tribe shall pay for this land a\r\nprice agreed upon with the Cherokees, subject to the approval of the\r\nPresident of the United States, and in case of disagreement the price\r\nto be fixed by the President.\r\n\r\nSuch tribe shall also pay into the national fund a sum to be agreed\r\nupon by the respective parties, not greater in proportion to the whole\r\nexisting national fund and the probable proceeds of the lands herein\r\nceded or authorized to be ceded or sold than their numbers bear to the\r\nwhole number of Cherokees, and thereafter they shall enjoy all the\r\nrights of native Cherokees.\r\n\r\nNo Indians without tribal organization, or who having one shall have\r\ndetermined to abandon the same, shall be permitted to settle in the\r\nCherokee country east of 96° without the permission of the proper\r\nCherokee authorities. And no Indians determining to preserve their\r\ntribal organization shall so settle without such consent, unless the\r\nPresident, after a full hearing of the Cherokee objections thereto,\r\nshall deem them insufficient and authorize such settlement.\r\n\r\n16. The United States may settle friendly Indians on any Cherokee lands\r\nwest of 96°; such lands to be selected in compact form and to equal in\r\nquantity 160 acres for each member of the tribe so settled. Such tribe\r\nshall pay therefor a price to be agreed upon with the Cherokees, or, in\r\nthe event of failure to agree, the price to be fixed by the President.\r\nThe tract purchased shall be conveyed in fee simple to the tribe so\r\npurchasing, to be held in common or allotted in severalty as the United\r\nStates may decide.\r\n\r\nThe right of possession and jurisdiction over the Cherokee country west\r\nof 96° to abide with the Cherokees until thus sold and occupied.\r\n\r\n17. The Cherokee Nation cedes to the United States, in trust to be\r\nsurveyed, appraised, and sold for the benefit of that nation, the tract\r\nof 800,000 acres sold to them by the United States by article 2, treaty\r\nof 1835, and the strip of land ceded to the nation by article 4, treaty\r\nof 1835, lying within the State of Kansas, and consents that said lands\r\nmay be included in the limits and jurisdiction of said State. The\r\nappraisement shall not average less than $1.25 per acre, exclusive of\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior shall, after due advertisement for sealed\r\nbids, sell such lands to the highest bidders for cash in tracts of\r\nnot exceeding 160 acres each at not less than the appraised value.\r\nSettlers having improvements to the value of $50 or more on any of the\r\nlands not mineral and occupied for agricultural purposes at the date\r\nof the signing of this treaty, shall, after due proof under rules to\r\nbe prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, be allowed to purchase\r\nat the appraised value the smallest quantity of land to include their\r\nimprovements, not exceeding 160 acres each.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of survey and appraisement shall be paid out of the\r\nproceeds of the sale of the lands, and nothing herein shall prevent the\r\nSecretary of the Interior from selling to any responsible party for\r\ncash all of the unoccupied portion of these lands in a body, for not\r\nless than $800,000.\r\n\r\n18. Any lands owned by the Cherokees in Arkansas or in States east of\r\nthe Mississippi River may be sold by their national council, upon the\r\napproval of the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\n19. All Cherokees residing on the ceded lands desiring to remove to the\r\nCherokee country proper shall be paid by the purchasers the appraised\r\nvalue of their improvements. Such Cherokees desiring to remain on the\r\nlands so occupied by them shall be entitled to a patent in fee simple\r\nfor 320 acres each, to include their improvements, and shall thereupon\r\ncease to be members of the nation.\r\n\r\n20. Whenever the Cherokee national council shall so request, the\r\nSecretary of the Interior shall cause the country reserved for the\r\nCherokees to be surveyed and allotted among them at the expense of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n21. The United States shall at its own expense cause to be run and\r\nmarked the boundary line between the Cherokee Nation and the States\r\nof Arkansas, Missouri, and Kansas as far west as the Arkansas River,\r\nby two commissioners, one of whom shall be designated by the Cherokee\r\nnational council.\r\n\r\n22. The Cherokee national council shall have the privilege of\r\nappointing an agent to examine the accounts of the nation with the\r\nUnited States, who shall have free access to all the accounts and books\r\nin the Executive Departments relating to the business of the Cherokees.\r\n\r\n23. All funds due the nation or accruing from the sale of their lands\r\nshall be invested in United States registered stocks and the interest\r\npaid semi-annually on the order of the Cherokee Nation, and applied\r\nto the following purposes: 35 per cent. for the support of the common\r\nschools of the nation and educational purposes; 15 per cent. for the\r\norphan fund, and 50 per cent. for general purposes, including salaries\r\nof district officers. The Secretary of the Interior, with the approval\r\nof the President, may pay out of the funds due the nation, on the\r\norder of the national council, an amount necessary to meet outstanding\r\nobligations of the Cherokee Nation, not exceeding $150,000.\r\n\r\n24. Three thousand dollars shall be paid out of the Cherokee funds to\r\nthe Rev. Evan Jones, now in poverty and crippled, as a reward for forty\r\nyears' faithful missionary labors in the nation.\r\n\r\n25. All bounty and pay of deceased Cherokee soldiers remaining\r\nunclaimed at the expiration of two years shall be paid as the national\r\ncouncil may direct, to be applied to the foundation and support of an\r\norphan asylum.\r\n\r\n26. The United States guarantee to the Cherokees the quiet and\r\npeaceable possession of their country and protection against domestic\r\nfeuds and insurrection as well as hostilities of other tribes. They\r\nshall also be protected from intrusion by all unauthorized citizens\r\nof the United States attempting to settle on their lands or reside in\r\ntheir territory. Damages resulting from hostilities among the Indian\r\ntribes shall be charged to the tribe beginning the same.\r\n\r\n27. The United States shall have the right to establish one or more\r\nmilitary posts in the Cherokee Nation. No sutler or other person,\r\nexcept the medical department proper, shall have the right to introduce\r\nspirituous, vinous, or malt liquors into the country, and then only for\r\nstrictly medical purposes. All unauthorized persons are prohibited from\r\ncoming into or remaining in the Cherokee Nation, and it is the duty of\r\nthe United States agent to have such persons removed as required by the\r\nIndian intercourse laws of the United States.\r\n\r\n28. The United States agree to pay for provisions and clothing\r\nfurnished the army of Appotholehala in the winter of 1861 and 1862 a\r\nsum not exceeding $10,000.\r\n\r\n29. The United States agree to pay out of the proceeds of sale of\r\nCherokee lands $10,000, or so much thereof as may be necessary, to\r\ndefray the expenses of the Cherokee delegates and representatives\r\ninvited to Washington by the United States to conclude this treaty, and\r\nalso to pay the reasonable costs and expenses of the delegates of the\r\nSouthern Cherokees.\r\n\r\n30. The United States agree to pay not exceeding $20,000 to cover\r\nlosses sustained by missionaries or missionary societies, in being\r\ndriven from the Cherokee country by United States agents and on account\r\nof property taken and destroyed by United States troops.\r\n\r\n31. All provisions of former treaties not inconsistent with this treaty\r\nshall continue in force; and nothing herein shall be construed as an\r\nacknowledgment by the United States or as a relinquishment by the\r\nCherokee Nation of any claims or demands under the guarantees of former\r\ntreaties, except as herein expressly provided.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 582: United States Statutes at Large, Vol. XIV, p. 799.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATY CONCLUDED APRIL 27, 1868; PROCLAIMED JUNE 10, 1868.[583]\r\n\r\n    _Held at Washington, D. C., between Nathaniel G. Taylor,\r\n    commissioner on the part of the United States, and the duly\r\n    authorized delegates of the Cherokee Nation._\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL PROVISIONS.\r\n\r\nThis treaty is concluded as a supplemental article to the treaty of\r\nJuly 19, 1866.\r\n\r\nAfter reciting that a contract was entered into August 30, 1866, for\r\nthe sale of the Cherokee neutral land, between James Harlan, Secretary\r\nof the Interior, and the American Emigrant Company; that such contract\r\nhad been annulled as illegal by O. H. Browning, as Secretary of the\r\nInterior, who in turn entered into a contract of sale October 9, 1867,\r\nwith James F. Joy, for the same lands, it is agreed by this treaty, in\r\norder to prevent litigation and to harmonize conflicting interests,\r\nas follows, viz: An assignment of the contract of August 30, 1866,\r\nwith the American Emigrant Company shall be made to James F. Joy. Said\r\ncontract as hereinafter modified is reaffirmed and declared valid. The\r\ncontract with James F. Joy of October 9, 1867, shall be relinquished\r\nand canceled by said Joy or his attorney. The said first contract,\r\nas hereinafter modified, and the assignment thereof, together with\r\nthe relinquishment of the second contract, are hereby ratified and\r\nconfirmed whenever such assignment and relinquishment shall be entered\r\nof record in the Department of the Interior, and when said Joy shall\r\nhave accepted such assignment and entered into contract to perform\r\nall the obligations of the American Emigrant Company under said first\r\ncontract as hereinafter modified.\r\n\r\nThe modifications of said contract are declared to be:\r\n\r\n1. Within ten days from the ratification of this treaty, $75,000 shall\r\nbe paid to the Secretary of the Interior, as trustee for the Cherokee\r\nNation.\r\n\r\n2. The other deferred payments shall be paid when they fall due, with\r\ninterest only from the ratification hereof.\r\n\r\nIt is distinctly understood that said Joy shall take only the residue\r\nof said lands after securing to \"actual settlers\" the lands to which\r\nthey are entitled under the amended seventeenth article of the treaty\r\nof July 19, 1866. The proceeds of the sales of such lands so occupied\r\nby settlers shall inure to the benefit of the Cherokee Nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL DATA.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES DESIRE TO REMOVE INDIANS FROM KANSAS TO INDIAN TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nIt had for several years been the hope of the Government that so\r\nsoon as the war was ended arrangements could be perfected whereby\r\nconcessions of territory could be obtained from the principal Southern\r\ntribes. To territory thus acquired it was proposed, after obtaining\r\ntheir consent, to remove the several tribes possessing reservations\r\nin Kansas, or at least such of them as were not prepared or willing\r\nto dissolve their tribal relations and become citizens of the United\r\nStates. The fertile and agreeable prairies of that State were being\r\nrapidly absorbed by an ever increasing stream of immigration, which\r\ngave promise as soon as the war should close and the armies be\r\ndisbanded of an indefinite increase. The numerous Indian reservations\r\ndotting the face of the State in all directions afforded most desirable\r\nfarming and grazing lands that would soon be needed for this rapidly\r\nmultiplying white population.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNCIL OF SOUTHERN TRIBES AT CAMP NAPOLEON.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, with much gratification that the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior learned during the month of June, 1865,[584] of the\r\nholding of a council at Camp Napoleon, Chattatomha, on the 24th of\r\nMay preceding, which was attended by representatives of all the\r\nsouthern and southwestern tribes, as well as by the Osages. At this\r\ncouncil delegates representing each tribe had been appointed to visit\r\nWashington, authorized to enter into treaty negotiations. Before these\r\ndelegations were ready to start, however, it had been determined by the\r\nPresident to appoint special commissioners, who should proceed to the\r\nIndian country and meet them at Fort Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL COUNCIL AT FORT SMITH.\r\n\r\nThis commission as constituted consisted of D. N. Cooley, Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs; Elijah Sells, superintendent of Indian affairs;\r\nThomas Wistar, a leading Quaker; General W. S. Harney, of the United\r\nStates Army; and Col. E. S. Parker, of General Grant's staff.[585]\r\nProceeding to Fort Smith, the council was convened on the 8th day of\r\nSeptember, and was attended by delegates representing the Creeks,\r\nChoctaws, Chickasaws, Cherokees, Seminoles, Osages, Senecas, Shawnees,\r\nQuapaws, Wyandots, Wichitas, and Comanches. In opening the council the\r\nIndians were informed that the commissioners had been sent to ascertain\r\ntheir disposition and feeling toward the United States; that most of\r\nthem had violated their treaty obligations to the Government and, by\r\nentering into diplomatic relations with the so-called Confederate\r\nStates, had forfeited all right to the protection of the United States\r\nand subjected their property to the penalty of confiscation.\r\n\r\nThey were assured, however, that the Government had no disposition to\r\ndeal harshly with them. On the contrary, it was desirous of undertaking\r\nsuch measures as would conduce to their happiness, and was especially\r\ndetermined to grant handsome recognition to those of them whose loyalty\r\nhad been so firmly and consistently manifested in the face of the\r\nmost cruelly adverse conditions. The council continued in session for\r\nthirteen days. On the second day the Indians were informed that the\r\ncommissioners were empowered to enter into treaties with the several\r\ntribes upon the basis of the following propositions:\r\n\r\n1. That opposing factions of each tribe must enter into a treaty for\r\npermanent peace and amity among themselves: also between each other as\r\ntribes, and with the United States.\r\n\r\n2. The tribes settled in the \"Indian country\" should bind themselves at\r\nthe call of the United States authorities to assist in compelling the\r\nwild tribes of the plains to keep the peace.\r\n\r\n3. Slavery should be abolished and measures should be taken to\r\nincorporate the slaves into the several tribes, with their rights\r\nguaranteed.\r\n\r\n4. A general stipulation as to the final abolition of slavery.\r\n\r\n5. A part of the Indian country should be set apart to be purchased\r\nfor the use of such Indians from Kansas or elsewhere as the Government\r\nshould desire to colonize therein.\r\n\r\n6. That the policy of the Government to unite all the Indian tribes of\r\nthis region into one consolidated government should be accepted.\r\n\r\n7. That no white persons, except Government employés or officers or\r\nemployés of internal improvement companies authorized by Government,\r\nshould be permitted to reside in the country unless incorporated with\r\nthe several nations.\r\n\r\n_Reasons for Cherokee disloyalty._--The subsequent sessions of the\r\ncouncil were largely taken up in the discussion of these propositions\r\nby the representatives of the various tribes. It is only with the\r\nconduct of the Cherokees, however, that the present history is\r\nconcerned. The address of the representatives of the \"loyal\" portion\r\nof this tribe is especially noteworthy in this, that they charged the\r\ncause of their alliance with the rebel authorities upon the United\r\nStates, by reason of the latter having violated its treaty obligations\r\nin failing to give them protection, whereby they were _compelled_ to\r\nenter into treaty relations with the Confederacy. This statement the\r\npresident of the commission took occasion to traverse, and to assure\r\nthem of the existence of abundant evidence that their alliance with the\r\nConfederacy was voluntary and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the council it was ascertained that no final and\r\ndefinite treaties could be made with the tribes represented, for the\r\nreason that until the differences between the loyal and disloyal\r\nportions could be healed no truly representative delegations of both\r\nfactions could be assembled in council. Preliminary articles of peace\r\nand amity with the different factions of each tribe were prepared and\r\nsigned as a basis for future negotiations.\r\n\r\n_Factional hostility among the Cherokees._--The only tribe with whom\r\nthe commissioners were unsuccessful in re-establishing friendly\r\nrelations between these factions was the Cherokees.[586]\r\n\r\nThe ancient feuds between the Ross and Ridge parties were still\r\nremembered. Many of the latter who had remained under Stand Watie in\r\nthe service of the Confederacy until the close of the war were yet\r\ndebarred from returning to their old homes, and were living in great\r\ndestitution on the banks of the Red River.[587] When the Ross party\r\nhad returned to their allegiance, in 1863, their national council had\r\npassed an act of confiscation[587] against the Watie faction, which\r\nhad been enforced with the utmost rigor, so that some five or six\r\nthousand members of the tribe had been rendered houseless, homeless,\r\nand vagabonds upon the face of the earth. All prospect of securing a\r\nreconciliation between these parties was for the time being abandoned\r\nby the commissioners, and the proposition was seriously considered\r\nof securing a home for Watie and his followers among the Choctaws or\r\nChickasaws.[588]\r\n\r\n_John Ross not recognized as principal chief._--On the day[589] on\r\nwhich the draft of the proposed preliminary treaty was presented to\r\nthe council by the commissioners John Ross arrived in the camp of the\r\nCherokees. It had already been determined by the commissioners among\r\nthemselves that his record had been such as to preclude his recognition\r\nby them as principal chief of that nation, and it was believed that his\r\ninfluence was being used to prevent the loyal Cherokees from coming to\r\nany amicable arrangement with their Southern brethren.\r\n\r\nThe chairman therefore read to the council[590] a paper signed by the\r\nseveral commissioners, reciting the machinations and deceptions of John\r\nRoss. It was alleged that he did not represent the will and wishes\r\nof the loyal Cherokees, and was not the choice of any considerable\r\nportion of the nation for the office claimed by him, an office which\r\nby the Cherokee law the commissioners believed he did not in fact hold.\r\nThey therefore refused, as commissioners representing the interests of\r\nthe United States, to recognize Ross in any manner as the chief of the\r\nCherokee Nation.\r\n\r\n_Loyal Cherokees will sign treaty conditionally._--At the same sitting\r\nof the council, Colonel Reese, of the loyal Cherokee delegation,\r\ndeclared that they were willing to sign the proposed treaty, but in so\r\ndoing would not acknowledge that they had forfeited their rights and\r\nprivileges to annuities and lands as set forth in the preamble, but\r\nthat their signatures must be made under the following statement, viz:\r\n\"We, the loyal delegation, acknowledge the execution of the treaty\r\nof October 7, 1861, but we solemnly declare that the execution was\r\nprocured by the coercion of the rebel army.\"\r\n\r\n_Southern Cherokees will sign treaty conditionally._--On the following\r\nday[591] the credentials of the Southern Cherokees were presented\r\nby E. C. Boudinot, accompanied by the statement that they cordially\r\nacceded to the 1st, 2d, 4th, 5th, and 7th propositions of the\r\ncommissioners without qualification; that they accepted the abolition\r\nof slavery as an accomplished fact, and were willing to give such fact\r\nlegal significance by appropriate acts of council. They insisted,\r\nhowever, that it would neither be for the benefit of the emancipated\r\nnegro nor for that of the Indian to incorporate the former into the\r\ntribe on an equal footing with its original members. They were also\r\nopposed to the policy of consolidating all the tribes in the Indian\r\nTerritory under one government, because of the many incongruous and\r\nirreconcilable elements which no power could bring into a semblance of\r\nassimilation.[592]\r\n\r\n_Southern Cherokees want a division of territory._--They had already\r\nproffered and were willing again to proffer the olive-branch of peace\r\nand reconciliation to their brethren of the so called loyal portion of\r\nthe nation, but respectfully urged that after all the blood that had\r\nbeen shed and the intense bitterness that seemed to fill the bosoms of\r\ntheir brethren they ought not to be expected to live in an undivided\r\ncountry. They wished peace, and they believed they could have it in no\r\nother way than by an equitable division of the Cherokee country in such\r\nmanner as should seem most appropriate to the United States.\r\n\r\n_Statement by John Ross._--The delegation of loyal Cherokees at the\r\nnext session of the council[593] presented their exceptions to the\r\naction of the commissioners in declining to recognize John Ross and\r\nthat gentleman was permitted to make a statement in his own behalf. The\r\nconstantly accumulating evidence against him was such, however, as to\r\nmore fully confirm the commissioners in the propriety of their previous\r\naction.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September the council adjourned, to meet again at the\r\ncall of the Secretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFERENCE AT WASHINGTON, D. C.\r\n\r\nEarly in 1866, in accordance with the understanding had at the\r\nadjournment of the Fort Smith council, delegations representing both\r\nfactions of the Cherokees proceeded to Washington for the purpose\r\nof concluding some definite articles of agreement with the United\r\nStates. They were represented by eminent counsel in the persons of\r\nGeneral Thomas Ewing for the loyal and Hon. D. W. Voorhees for the\r\nSouthern element. Many joint interviews and discussions were held in\r\nthe presence of Commissioners Cooley, Parker, and Sells, but without\r\nany hopeful results. The bitterness exhibited in these discussions\r\nupon both sides gave but little promise that enmities of more than\r\ntwenty years' standing could be subordinated to the demands of a\r\npeaceful and harmonious government. The Southern element, which\r\nnumbered about sixty-five hundred, constituted but a minority of the\r\nwhole nation. These, with the exception of perhaps two hundred, were\r\nstill living in banishment among the Choctaws and Chickasaws, and felt\r\nit would be unsafe to return to their old homes with the Ross party\r\nin full possession of the machinery of government and ready to apply\r\nwith severest rigor the enginery of their confiscation law. Their\r\nrepresentatives were therefore instructed to demand, as the only hope\r\nfor their future peace and happiness, a division of the Cherokee lands\r\nand funds in proportion to their numbers between the two contending\r\nparties.[594] On the other hand, the representatives of the Ross or\r\nloyal party insisted that there was no good reason existing why the\r\nSouthern element should be unable to dwell harmoniously with them in\r\nthe same country and under the same laws, which they asserted always\r\nhad been and always would be impartially and justly administered, so\r\nfar as they were concerned.\r\n\r\nA just feeling of national pride would always forbid their consent\r\nto any scheme against the integrity and unity of the whole Cherokee\r\nNation. But, while they were thus on principle compelled to antagonize\r\nthe demand of the Southern faction, yet if that element felt the\r\nimpossibility of living comfortably in the midst of their loyal\r\nbrethren the latter were willing that the portion of their national\r\ndomain known as the Canadian district should be devoted to their sole\r\noccupation and settlement for a period of two years or until the\r\nPresident of the United States should deem it inadvisable to longer\r\ncontinue such exclusiveness.[595] To this again the Southern Cherokees\r\nrefused assent, because of the insufficient area of the Canadian\r\ndistrict, and because they were unwilling to trust themselves under the\r\njurisdiction of their enemies' laws and courts.\r\n\r\n_Factious conduct of both parties._--Each faction was desirous of\r\nmaking a treaty with the Government, and each was fearful lest the\r\nUnited States should recognize the other as the proper party with which\r\nto conclude that treaty. The United States officials were convinced\r\nthat the Ross party represented the rightfully constituted authorities\r\nof the nation, and their delegates were thus the only really authorized\r\npersons with whom a treaty could with strict propriety be made. But\r\nthey were also convinced that it would be highly improper to conclude\r\nany treaty which should leave the Southern Cherokees in any degree\r\nsubject to the malice and revengeful disposition of their enemies. It\r\nwas the desire of the United States to secure from the Cherokees a\r\ncession of sufficient land upon which to colonize the Indian tribes\r\nthen resident in Kansas. The Southern party therefore agreed to cede\r\nfor that purpose all of the Cherokee domain west of 96° west longitude,\r\nand to sell the \"neutral land\" for the sum of $500,000, provided the\r\nGovernment would treat with them. The loyal party, however, refused\r\nto cede any territory for purposes of colonization east of 97° west\r\nlongitude, and demanded $1,000,000 for the \"neutral land,\" at the same\r\ntime assuming that the United States had no right or authority to\r\nentertain any proposition from any other source whatever involving the\r\ndisposition of the domain or funds of the Cherokee Nation.[596]\r\n\r\nInterviews, consultations, and discussions followed each other in rapid\r\nsuccession, covering a period of several months, with no apparent\r\napproach toward a final agreement.\r\n\r\n_Treaty concluded with Southern Cherokees._--At length the United\r\nStates commissioners despairing of success with the loyal element,\r\nconcluded a treaty with the Southern party.[597]\r\n\r\nAmong other things, this treaty provided that a quantity of land equal\r\nto 160 acres for every man, woman, and child, including the freedmen\r\nbelonging to the Southern party, and also for each North Carolina\r\nCherokee who should, within one year, remove and join them, should be\r\nset apart in that portion of their territory known as the Canadian\r\ndistrict, for their sole use and occupancy. In case this district\r\nshould afford an insufficient area of land, there should be added a\r\nfurther tract extending northward and lying between Grand River and\r\nthe Creek boundary, and still further northward and westward between\r\nthat river and the line of 95° 30' west longitude, or a line as far\r\nwest if necessary as 96° west longitude, until the necessary complement\r\nof land, based upon a census of their people, should be secured. It\r\nwas further agreed that the Southern Cherokees should have exclusive\r\njurisdiction and control in the Canadian district, southwest of the\r\nArkansas River, and of all that tract of country lying northeast of the\r\nArkansas River and bounded on the east by Grand River, north by the\r\nline of 36° 30' north latitude, and west by 96° of west longitude and\r\nthe Creek reservation. In consideration of these things, the Southern\r\nCherokees ceded absolutely to the United States all other Cherokee\r\nlands owned by them, at such price as should be agreed upon by the\r\nrespective parties, whenever the Northern or loyal Cherokees should\r\nagree with the United States to sell the same. The sale of the \"neutral\r\nland\" was provided for at a sum per acre to be fixed by the President,\r\nwhich should amount in the aggregate to not less than $500,000. In\r\nall future negotiations with the United States, as in the past, but\r\none Cherokee Nation should be recognized, but each of the two parties\r\nor divisions should be represented by delegates in proportion to\r\ntheir respective numbers. All moneys due the nation should be divided\r\nbetween the parties in the same proportion, and whenever the state\r\nof feeling throughout the nation should become such as by their own\r\ndesire to render a complete and harmonious reunion of the two factions\r\npracticable, the United States would consent to the accomplishment of\r\nsuch a measure.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was duly signed, witnessed, and transmitted through the\r\nSecretary of the Interior to the President for submission to the Senate\r\nof the United States. The President retained it for more than a month,\r\nwhen, upon the conclusion of a treaty under date of July 19, 1866,[598]\r\nwith the loyal Cherokees, he returned the former to the commissioners\r\nat the time he transmitted the latter instrument to the Senate for the\r\nadvice and consent of that body to its ratification.\r\n\r\n_Treaty concluded with loyal Cherokees._--The treaty of July 19, though\r\nnot filling the full measure of desire on the part of the United\r\nStates, and though not thoroughly satisfactory in its terms to either\r\nof the discordant Cherokee elements, was the best compromise that could\r\nbe effected under the circumstances, and was ratified and proclaimed\r\nAugust 11, 1866. It is unnecessary to recite its provisions here, as\r\na full abstract of them has been given in the preceding pages. Nine\r\ndays prior to its conclusion the Secretary of the Interior addressed a\r\ncommunication to Commissioner Cooley, who was president of the board of\r\ntreaty commissioners, reminding him of their action the preceding fall\r\nat Fort Smith in suspending John Ross from his functions as principal\r\nchief, suggesting that the reasons rendering that action necessary\r\nat the time no longer existed, and giving his consent, in case the\r\ncommissioners should feel so inclined, to the immediate recognition of\r\nRoss in that capacity.\r\n\r\n_Death of John Ross._--The old man was at this time unable, by reason\r\nof illness, to participate in the deliberations concerning the new\r\ntreaty,[599] and within a few days thereafter he died. He was in many\r\nrespects a remarkable man. Though of Scotch-Indian parentage he was the\r\nchampion of the full-blood as against the mixed-blood members of the\r\nnation, and for nearly half a century had been a prominent figure in\r\nall the important affairs of the Cherokee Nation. Notwithstanding his\r\nmany opportunities for immense gains he seems to have died a poor man\r\nand his family were left without the necessaries of life. His sixty\r\nslaves, and everything he possessed in the way of houses, stock, and\r\nother like property, were swept away during the war.[600]\r\n\r\n\r\nCESSION AND SALE OF CHEROKEE STRIP AND NEUTRAL LANDS.\r\n\r\nThe seventeenth article of the treaty of July 19, 1866, ceded to the\r\nUnited States, in trust to be disposed of for the benefit of the\r\nCherokees, both the tract known as the \"neutral land,\" previously\r\nalluded to, and that known as the \"Cherokee strip.\" The latter was a\r\nnarrow strip, extending from the Neosho River west to the western limit\r\nof the Cherokee lands. The Cherokee domain, as described in the treaty\r\nof 1835, extended northward to the south line of the Osage lands. When\r\nthe State of Kansas was admitted to the Union its south boundary was\r\nmade coincident with the thirty-seventh degree of north latitude, which\r\nwas found to run a short distance to the southward of the southern\r\nOsage boundary, thus leaving the narrow \"strip\" of Cherokee lands\r\nwithin the boundaries of that State.\r\n\r\nThe proviso of the seventeenth article just mentioned required that the\r\nlands therein ceded should be surveyed, after the manner of surveying\r\nthe public lands of the United States, and should be appraised by two\r\ncommissioners, one of whom should be appointed by the United States and\r\nthe other by the Cherokee Nation, such appraisement not to average less\r\nthan $1.25 per acre. After such appraisement, the lands were to be sold\r\nunder the direction of the Secretary of the Interior on sealed bids, in\r\ntracts of not exceeding 160 acres each, for cash, with the proviso that\r\nnothing should forbid the sale, if deemed for the best interests of the\r\nIndians, of the entire tract of \"neutral land\" (except the portion\r\noccupied by actual settlers) in one body to any responsible party for\r\ncash for a sum not less than $800,000. An exception was made as to the\r\nlands which were occupied by bona fide white settlers at the date of\r\nthe signing of the treaty, who were allowed the privilege of purchasing\r\nat the appraised value, exclusive of their improvements, in quantities\r\nof not exceeding 160 acres each, to include such improvements.\r\n\r\nThe language of this seventeenth article being somewhat obscure and\r\nsubject to different interpretations as to the actual intent concerning\r\nthe method of disposing of the \"Cherokee strip,\" no action was taken\r\ntoward its survey and sale until the year 1872, when by an act of\r\nCongress[601] provision was made for the appraisal of that portion of\r\nit lying east of Arkansas River at not less than $2 per acre, and the\r\nportion west of that river at not less than $1.50 per acre. Further\r\nprovision was also made, by the same act, for its disposal on certain\r\nconditions to actual settlers, and any portion not being rendered\r\namenable to these conditions was to be sold on sealed bids at not less\r\nthan the minimum price fixed by the act. A considerable quantity of\r\nthe most fertile portion of the tract was thus disposed of to actual\r\nsettlers, though, as an encouragement to the sale, Congress was induced\r\nto pass an act[602] extending the limit of payment required of settlers\r\nto January 1, 1875. The price fixed by the act of 1872 being so high\r\nas to render the remainder of the land unattractive to settlers, a\r\nsubsequent act of Congress[603] directed that all unsold portions\r\nof the said tract should be offered through the General Land Office\r\nto settlers at $1.25 per acre, for the period of one year, and that\r\nall land remaining unsold at the expiration of that period should be\r\nsold for cash at not less than $1 per acre. This act was conditional\r\nupon the approval of the Cherokee national council, which assent was\r\npromptly given, and the lands were disposed of under its provisions.\r\n\r\nShortly after the ratification of the treaty of 1866 steps were taken\r\ntoward a disposition of the \"neutral lands.\" Under date of August 30 of\r\nthat year Hon. James Harlan, Secretary of the Interior, entered into\r\na contract with a corporation known as the American Emigrant Company,\r\nwhereby that company became the purchaser, subject to the limitations\r\nand restrictions set forth in the seventeenth article of the treaty, of\r\nthe whole tract of neutral land at the price of $1 per acre, payable\r\nin installments, running through a period of several years. This\r\ncontract was subsequently declared invalid[604] by Hon. O. H. Browning,\r\nthe successor of Secretary Harlan, on the score that the proviso\r\n\"for cash,\" contained in the treaty of 1866, in the common business\r\nacceptation of the term, meant a payment of the purchase price in full\r\nby the purchaser at the time of the sale, and was intended to forbid\r\nany sale on deferred payments.\r\n\r\nIn the following spring[605] an agreement was entered into between the\r\nCherokee authorities and the Atlantic and Pacific Railway Company,\r\nwhich involved a modification of the seventeenth article of the treaty\r\nof 1866, and engaged to sell the \"neutral lands\" to that company on\r\ncredit. This agreement was submitted by the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs to the Secretary of the Interior for transmission through the\r\nPresident to the Senate for ratification as an amended article to\r\nthe treaty of July 19, 1866, but did not meet with favorable action.\r\nSubsequently[606] the Secretary of the Interior entered into an\r\nagreement with James F. Joy, of Detroit, Mich., whereby the latter\r\nbecame the purchaser of all that portion of the \"neutral land\" not\r\nsubject to the rights of actual settlers, at the price of $1 per acre\r\nin cash. Difficulties having arisen by reason of the conflicting claims\r\nof the different would-be purchasers, it was finally deemed judicious\r\nto obviate them by concluding a supplemental article to the treaty of\r\n1866. This was accordingly done, at Washington, on the 27th of April,\r\n1868, and the same was ratified and proclaimed on the 10th of June\r\nfollowing.[607] This supplemental treaty provided for the assignment by\r\nthe American Emigrant Company to James F. Joy of its contract of August\r\n30, 1866. It was further stipulated that that contract, in a modified\r\nform, should be reaffirmed and declared valid, and that the contract\r\nentered into with James F. Joy on the 9th of October, 1867, should be\r\nrelinquished and canceled. Furthermore, it was agreed that the first\r\ncontract, as modified, and the assignment to Joy, together with the\r\nrelinquishment of the second contract, should be considered ratified\r\nand confirmed whenever such assignment and relinquishment should be\r\nentered of record in the Department of the Interior and when James F.\r\nJoy should have accepted such assignment and entered into a contract\r\nwith the Secretary of the Interior to assume and perform all the\r\nobligations of the American Emigrant Company under the first mentioned\r\ncontract as modified.\r\n\r\nThe assignment of their contract with Secretary Harlan by the American\r\nEmigrant Company to James F. Joy was made on the 6th of June, 1868.\r\nThe contract of October 9, 1867, between Secretary Browning and James\r\nF. Joy was relinquished by the latter June 8, 1868, and on the same\r\nday a new contract was entered into with Joy accepting the assignment\r\nof the American Emigrant Company and undertaking to assume and perform\r\nall the obligations of the original contractor thereunder, subject to\r\nthe modifications prescribed in the supplemental treaty of April 27,\r\n1868.[608]\r\n\r\nThe requirement of the treaty of 1866 as to the appraisal of the\r\nneutral lands was carried into effect by the appointment of John T.\r\nCox, on behalf of the United States, and of William A. Phillips, on\r\nbehalf of the Cherokees, as commissioners of appraisal. From their\r\nreport as corrected it is ascertained that the quantity awarded to\r\nsettlers was 154,395.12[609] acres; quantity purchased by Joy under\r\nhis contract, 640,199.69 acres. A portion of the lands awarded to\r\nsettlers, but upon which default was made in payment, and amounting\r\nto 3,231.21[610] acres, was advertised and sold on sealed bids to\r\nthe highest bidders.[611] A small portion[612] of the tract was also\r\nabsorbed by the claims of Cherokees who were settled thereon. The\r\nentire area of the neutral lands, as shown by the plats of survey, was\r\n799,614.72 acres.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPRAISAL OF CONFISCATED PROPERTY--CENSUS.\r\n\r\nIn pursuance of the third article of the treaty of 1866, and in\r\naccordance with the terms of an act of Congress approved July 27,\r\n1868,[613] H. R. Kretschmar, on behalf of the United States, and ----\r\nStephens, on behalf of the Cherokee Nation, were appointed, in the\r\nsummer of 1868,[614] commissioners to appraise the cost of property\r\nand improvements on farms confiscated and sold by the Cherokee Nation\r\nfrom acts growing out of the Southern rebellion. J. J. Humphreys had\r\nbeen appointed May 21 of the preceding year to perform the same duties,\r\nbut had not fulfilled the object of his instructions. The commission\r\nreported[615] the value of the improvements of the character referred\r\nto as $4,657.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Tompkins was designated in the summer of 1867[616] to take the\r\ncensus of Cherokees in the Indian Territory contemplated by the twelfth\r\narticle of the treaty of 1866. From his returns it appears that the\r\nnation then numbered 13,566 souls.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW TREATY CONCLUDED BUT NEVER RATIFIED.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years following the conclusion of the treaty of 1866\r\npeace and quietude prevailed among the Cherokees. They were blessed\r\nwith abundant crops and the bitter animosities of the past years became\r\ngreatly softened, insomuch that the Secretary of the Interior, in the\r\nspring of 1868,[617] under the authority of the President, directed\r\nthat negotiations be opened with them for a new treaty in compliance\r\nwith their request.[618] Articles of agreement were accordingly entered\r\ninto on the 9th of July, 1868,[619] between N. G. Taylor, commissioner\r\non behalf of the United States, and the principal chiefs and delegates\r\nrepresenting the Cherokee Nation. The reasons rendering this treaty\r\nboth desirable and necessary are thus set forth in the preamble, viz:\r\n\r\n    Whereas the feuds and dissensions which for many years divided\r\n    the Cherokees and retarded their progress and civilization have\r\n    ceased to exist, and there remains no longer any cause for\r\n    maintaining the political divisions and distinctions contemplated\r\n    by the treaty of 19th July, 1866; and whereas the whole Cherokee\r\n    people are now united in peace and friendship, and are earnestly\r\n    desirous of preserving and perpetuating the harmony and unity\r\n    prevailing among them; and whereas many of the provisions of said\r\n    treaty of July 19, 1866, are so obscure and ambiguous as to render\r\n    their true intent and meaning on important points difficult to\r\n    define and impossible to execute and may become a fruitful source\r\n    of conflict not only amongst the Cherokees themselves but between\r\n    the authorities of the United States and the Cherokee Nation and\r\n    citizens; and whereas important interests remain unsettled between\r\n    the Government of the United States and the Cherokee Nation and its\r\n    citizens, which in justice to all concerned ought to be speedily\r\n    adjusted: Therefore, with a view to the preservation of that\r\n    harmony which now so happily subsists among the Cherokees, and to\r\n    the adjustment of all unsettled business growing out of treaty\r\n    stipulations between the Cherokee Nation and the Government of the\r\n    United States, it is mutually agreed by the parties to this treaty\r\n    as follows, etc.\r\n\r\nAmong the more important objects sought to be accomplished, and for\r\nwhich provision was made in the treaty, were:\r\n\r\n1. The abolition of all party distinctions among the Cherokees and the\r\nabrogation of all laws or treaty provisions tending to preserve such\r\ndistinctions.\r\n\r\n2. The boundaries of the Cherokee country are defined in detail and as\r\nextending as far west as the northeast corner of New Mexico.\r\n\r\n3. The United States reaffirm all obligations to the Cherokees arising\r\nout of treaty stipulations or legislative acts of the Government.\r\n\r\n4. The United States having by article 2 of the treaty with the\r\nComanches and Kiowas of October 18, 1865, set apart for their use\r\nand occupation and that of other friendly tribes that portion of the\r\nCherokee domain lying west of 98° W. longitude and south of 37° N.\r\nlatitude; and having further, by article 16 of Cherokee treaty of July\r\n19, 1866, set apart in effect for the like purpose of settling friendly\r\nIndians thereon all the remaining Cherokee domain west of 96° W.\r\nlongitude, agree to pay to the Cherokees therefor, including the tract\r\nknown as the \"Cherokee strip,\" in the State of Kansas, and estimated\r\nto contain in the aggregate the quantity of 13,768,000 acres, the sum\r\nof $3,500,000. This agreement was accompanied with the proviso that\r\nthe Cherokees should further relinquish to the United States all right\r\nand interest in and to that portion of the Cherokee \"outlet\" embraced\r\nwithin the Pan Handle of Texas, containing about 3,000,000 acres, as\r\nwell as that portion within New Mexico and Colorado, excepting and\r\nreserving, however, all salines west of 99° to the Cherokees.\r\n\r\n5. The United States agree to refund to the Cherokees the sum of\r\n$500,000 paid by the latter for the tract of \"neutral land,\" under the\r\ntreaty of 1835, together with 5 per cent. interest from the date of\r\nthat treaty, and to apply for the use and benefit of the former all\r\nmoneys accruing from the sale of that tract.\r\n\r\n6. The United States agree to ascertain the number of acres of land\r\nreserved and owned by the Cherokee Nation in the State of Arkansas, and\r\nin States east of the Mississippi River, and to pay to the Cherokees\r\nthe appraised value thereof.\r\n\r\n7. The United States agree to pay all arrears of Cherokee annuities\r\naccruing during the war and remaining unpaid.\r\n\r\n8. Citizens of the United States having become citizens of the\r\nCherokee Nation, shall not be held to answer before any court of the\r\nUnited States any further than if they were native-born Cherokees.\r\nAll Cherokees shall be held to answer for any offense committed among\r\nthemselves within the Cherokee Nation only to the courts of that\r\nnation, and for any offense committed without the limits of the nation\r\nshall be answerable only in the courts of the United States.\r\n\r\n9. The post and reservation of Fort Gibson having been reoccupied by\r\nthe United States, it is agreed that all Cherokees who purchased lots\r\nat the former sale of the military reserve by the Cherokee authorities,\r\nafter its abandonment by the United States, shall be reimbursed for all\r\nlosses occasioned by such military reoccupation.\r\n\r\n10. The United States shall continue to appoint a superintendent of\r\nIndian affairs for the Indian Territory and an agent for the Cherokees.\r\n\r\n11. A commission of three persons (two citizens of the United States\r\nand one Cherokee) shall be appointed to pass upon and adjudicate all\r\nclaims of the Cherokee Nation, or its citizens, against the United\r\nStates, or any of the several States.\r\n\r\n12. The powers of the agent provided for by the twenty-second article\r\nof the treaty of 1866 to examine the accounts of the Cherokee Nation\r\nwith the United States are enlarged to include the accounts of\r\nindividual Cherokees with the United States.\r\n\r\n13. All claims against the United States for Cherokee losses through\r\nthe action of the military authorities of the United States, or from\r\nthe neglect of the latter to afford the protection to the Cherokees\r\nguaranteed by treaty stipulation, are to be examined and reported on by\r\nthe commission appointed under the eleventh article of this treaty.\r\n\r\n14. Full faith and credit shall be given by the United States to the\r\npublic acts, records, and judicial proceedings of the Cherokee Nation\r\nwhen properly authenticated.\r\n\r\n15. Cherokees east of the Mississippi River, who remove within three\r\nyears to the Cherokee Nation, shall be entitled to all the privileges\r\nof citizens thereof. After that date they can only be admitted to\r\ncitizenship by act of the Cherokee national council.\r\n\r\n16. Every Cherokee shall have the free right to sell, ship, or drive\r\nto market any of his produce, wares, or live stock without taxation\r\nby the United States, or any State, and no license to trade in the\r\nCherokee Nation shall be granted unless approved by the Cherokee\r\ncouncil.\r\n\r\n17. Fifty thousand dollars shall be allowed for the expenses of the\r\nCherokee delegation in negotiating this treaty, one half to be paid out\r\nof their national fund.\r\n\r\n18. Executors and administrators of the owners of confiscated property\r\nshall have the right, under the third article of the treaty of 1866, to\r\ntake possession of such property.\r\n\r\n19. Twenty-four thousand dollars shall be paid by the Cherokee Nation\r\nto the heir of Bluford West, as the value of a saline and improvements\r\nof which he was dispossessed.\r\n\r\n20. Abrogation is declared of so much of article 7, treaty of 1866, as\r\nvests in United States courts jurisdiction of causes arising between\r\ncitizens of the Cherokee Nation, and transfers such jurisdiction to the\r\nCherokee courts.\r\n\r\n21. Provision of the treaty of 1866 relative to freedmen is reaffirmed;\r\nthe United States guarantee the Cherokees in the possession of their\r\nlands and protection from domestic strife, hostile invasions, and\r\naggressions by other Indian tribes or lawless whites.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUNDARIES OF THE CHEROKEE DOMAIN.\r\n\r\nDuring the proceedings incident to the negotiation of this treaty the\r\nquestion arose as to what constituted the proper western limit of the\r\nCherokee country.\r\n\r\nThe Cherokees themselves claimed that their territory extended at least\r\nas far west as 103° west longitude, being the northeast corner of New\r\nMexico. Their claim was based in part upon the second article of the\r\ntreaty of 1828,[620] the first article of the treaty of 1833,[621] the\r\nsecond article of the treaty of 1835,[622] and the first article of the\r\ntreaty of 1846.[623]\r\n\r\nThe treaty of 1828 guaranteed to the Cherokees seven millions of acres\r\nof land, and then declared in the following words: \"In addition to the\r\nseven millions of acres thus provided for, and bounded, the United\r\nStates further guarantee to the Cherokee Nation a perpetual outlet\r\nwest, and a free and unmolested use of all the country lying west of\r\nthe western boundary of the above described limits, and as far west as\r\nthe sovereignty of the United States and their right of soil extend.\"\r\n\r\nThis guarantee was reaffirmed in similar language by the treaties\r\nof 1833 and 1835, and the guaranty contained in the treaty of 1835\r\nwas reaffirmed by the treaty of 1846. The question, therefore, to\r\nbe determined was what constituted the extreme western limit of the\r\nsovereignty of the United States in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe colony or province of Louisiana had originally belonged to France.\r\nIn 1762 it was transferred to Spain, but was by Spain retroceded to\r\nFrance by the treaty of 1800. In 1803 the Emperor Napoleon, fearing a\r\nwar with England and the consequent occupation of the territory by that\r\npower, ceded it to the United States, but the boundaries of the cession\r\nwere very indefinite and, according to Chief Justice Marshall, were\r\ncouched in terms of \"studied ambiguity.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been consistently claimed by the United States up\r\nto the treaty of 1819 with Spain that the western boundary of the\r\nLouisiana purchase extended to the Rio Grande River. The better opinion\r\nseemed also to be that it followed up the Rio Grande from the mouth to\r\nthe mouth of the Pecos, and thence north. By that treaty, however, all\r\ndispute concerning boundaries was adjusted and the undefined boundary\r\nbetween Louisiana and Mexico was settled as following up the course of\r\nthe Sabine River to the Red River; thence by the course of that river\r\nto the one hundredth meridian, thence north to the Arkansas River and\r\nfollowing the course of that river to the forty-second parallel, and\r\nthence west to the Pacific Ocean. By many the position was taken that\r\nthis treaty was a _nudum pactum_, and Henry Clay, when it was under\r\nconsideration in the Senate, introduced a resolution into the House of\r\nRepresentatives declaring that Texas, being a part of the territory of\r\nthe United States, could not be ceded by the treaty making power to\r\na foreign country, and that the act was not only unauthorized by the\r\nConstitution but was void for another reason, viz, that this cession\r\nto Spain was in direct conflict with clear and positive stipulations\r\nmade by us in the treaty with France as to the disposition of the whole\r\nterritory. Under this theory of the invalidity of the treaty of 1819\r\nthe Cherokees claimed the extension of their boundary west of the one\r\nhundredth meridian. But, assuming the insufficiency of this claim, they\r\nstill fortified their title upon another proposition. Mexico succeeded,\r\nby the consummation of her independence, to all the territorial rights\r\nof Spain in this region. Texas in turn achieved her independence of\r\nMexico in 1836. In March, 1845, Texas became one of the United States,\r\nand thus, according to the Cherokee assumption, \"the United States\r\nagain came into possession of that portion of the outlet west of 100°,\r\nif indeed it had ever been a part of the territory claimed by Mexico\r\nand which by Texan independence she was forced to relinquish. The\r\nUnited States, more than a year after she had come into possession of\r\nthe country now claimed by the Cherokees, reaffirmed the grant to them,\r\nthat is to say, by the treaty of August 17, 1846.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"portion of the outlet west of 100°\" here alluded to is the strip\r\nof country lying between Kansas and Texas from north to south and\r\nbetween the 100° and New Mexico from east to west. By act of Congress\r\nof September 9, 1850,[624] the east boundary of New Mexico was fixed\r\nat 103° west longitude and the north boundary of Texas at 36° 30'\r\nnorth latitude, and by act of May 30, 1854,[625] the south boundary of\r\nKansas was established at 37° north latitude, thus leaving this strip\r\nof country outside the limits of any organized State or Territory,\r\nand so it still remains. This claim of the Cherokees was admitted by\r\nthe Commissioner of Indian Affairs at the time of the conclusion of\r\nthe treaty of July 9, 1868, to be a valid one, and was inserted in\r\nthe boundaries defined by that treaty. The treaty, however, failed\r\nof ratification, and it was afterwards determined by the executive\r\nauthorities of the United States that at the date of the treaty of\r\n1835 with the Cherokees the sovereignty of the United States extended\r\nonly to the one hundredth meridian, and that the reaffirmation of the\r\ntreaty guarantee of 1835 by subsequent treaties was not intended to\r\nenlarge the area of their territory, but simply as an assurance that\r\nthe United States were fully conscious of their obligation to maintain\r\nthe integrity of such guarantee. Consequently the Cherokee outlet was\r\nlimited in its western protraction to that meridian.\r\n\r\n\r\nDELAWARES, MUNSEES, AND SHAWNEES JOIN THE CHEROKEES.\r\n\r\nBy the fifteenth article of the treaty of 1866 provision was made that,\r\nupon certain conditions, the United States should have the right to\r\nsettle civilized Indians upon any unoccupied Cherokee territory east of\r\n96° west longitude. The material conditions limiting this right were\r\nthat terms of settlement should be agreed upon between the Cherokees\r\nand the Indians so desiring to settle, subject to the approval of the\r\nPresident of the United States; also that, in case the immigrants\r\ndesired to abandon their tribal relations and become citizens of the\r\nCherokee Nation, they should first pay into the Cherokee national\r\nfund a sum of money which should sustain the same proportion to that\r\nfund that the number of immigrant Indians should sustain to the whole\r\nCherokee population. If, on the other hand, the immigrants should\r\ndecide to preserve their tribal relations, laws, customs, and usages\r\nnot inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the Cherokee Nation,\r\na tract of land was to be set apart for them by metes and bounds which\r\nshould contain, if they so desired, a quantity equal to 160 acres for\r\neach soul. For this land they were to pay into the Cherokee national\r\nfund a sum to be agreed upon between themselves and the Cherokees,\r\nsubject to the approval of the President, and also a sum bearing a\r\nratio to the Cherokee national fund not greater than their numbers bore\r\nto the Cherokees. It was also stipulated that, if the Cherokees should\r\nrefuse their assent to the location of any civilized tribe (in a tribal\r\ncapacity) east of 96°, the President of the United States might, after\r\na full hearing of the case, overrule their objections and permit the\r\nsettlement to be made.\r\n\r\nThe Delawares were the first tribe to avail themselves of the benefits\r\nof the foregoing treaty provisions. Terms of agreement were entered\r\ninto between them and the Cherokees, which were ratified by the\r\nPresident on the 11th of April, 1867. Under the conditions of this\r\ninstrument the Delawares selected a tract of land equal to 160 acres\r\nfor each member of their tribe who should remove to the Cherokee\r\ncountry. For this tract they agreed to and did pay one dollar per\r\nacre. They also paid their required proportional sum into the Cherokee\r\nnational fund. The number of Delawares who elected to remove under this\r\nagreement was 985. The sums they were required to pay were: for land,\r\n$157,600; and as their proportion of the national fund, $121,834.65,\r\nthe latter amount having been calculated on the basis of an existing\r\nCherokee national fund of $1,678,000 and a population of 13,566.[626]\r\n\r\nFor a time after their removal the Delawares were much dissatisfied\r\nwith what they characterized as the unequal operation of the Cherokee\r\nlaws, and because much of the tract of land to which they were assigned\r\nwas of an inferior character. At one time some two hundred of them left\r\nthe Cherokee country, but after an absence of two years returned, since\r\nwhich a feeling of better contentment has prevailed. Following the\r\nDelawares, the Munsee or Christian Indians, a small fragmentary band\r\nwho under the treaty of July 16, 1859, had become confederated with the\r\nChippewas of Saginaw, Swan Creek, and Black River, residing in Kansas,\r\nperfected arrangements for their removal and assimilation with the\r\nCherokees.\r\n\r\nAn agreement was entered into[627] at Tahlequah, Cherokee Nation,\r\nhaving this end in view, and which was duly filed with the Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs.[628] The condition of this agreement was that, after\r\nthe complete dissolution of their relations with the Chippewas, the\r\nMunsees should pay into the Cherokee national fund all moneys that\r\nshould be found due them in pursuance of such separation. In the spring\r\nof 1868 an effort was made by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs, under\r\nthe authority of this same article of the treaty of 1866, to secure a\r\ntract of 900,000 acres for the location of the Navajoes. This tract,\r\nit was desired, should be so far east of 96° that sufficient room\r\nshould be left between the Navajoes and that meridian to admit of the\r\naccommodation of a settlement of Cherokees thereon. This proposition,\r\nhowever, the Cherokees refused to entertain, asserting that the\r\nNavajoes were not civilized Indians within the meaning of the treaty of\r\n1866.[629]\r\n\r\nThe next Indians to avail themselves of the privileges of Cherokee\r\ncitizenship were the Shawnees. By the treaty of 1825[630] a reserve\r\nhad been granted them covering an area in the richest portion of\r\nwhat is now the State of Kansas 50 by 120 miles in extent. By a\r\nsubsequent treaty in 1854,[631] they ceded, in deference to the\r\ndemands of encroaching civilization, all of this immense tract except\r\n200,000 acres. Among those who so elected, the greater portion of\r\nthis diminished reserve was divided into individual allotments of 200\r\nacres each. Patents were issued to the head of each family for the\r\nquantity thus allotted to the members of his or her family, with the\r\npower of alienation, subject to such restrictions as the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior might prescribe. In course of time alienation was made\r\nby these allottees of the greater portion of their land; the money\r\nthus received was squandered with the thriftless prodigality that\r\ncharacterizes barbarous or semi-civilized tribes the world over, and\r\ntheir impoverished condition was rendered still more uncomfortable by\r\nthe seeming determination of the rapidly increasing white settlers\r\nto take possession of their few remaining lands. In this unfortunate\r\ncondition of affairs they turned their eyes for relief toward the\r\ncountry of the Cherokees. Negotiations were entered into which resulted\r\nin the conclusion of an agreement, under date of June 7, 1869, and\r\nwhich received the approval of President Grant two days later. By the\r\nterms of this compact, the Shawnees then residing in Kansas, as well\r\nas their absentee brethren in the Indian Territory and elsewhere,\r\nwho should enroll themselves and permanently remove within two years\r\nto the Cherokee country, upon unoccupied lands east of 96°, should\r\nbe incorporated into, and ever after remain a part of the Cherokee\r\nNation, with the same standing in every respect as native Cherokees. In\r\nconsideration of these benefits the Shawnees agreed to transfer to the\r\nCherokee national fund a permanent annuity of $5,000 held by them under\r\nprevious treaties, in addition to the sum of $50,000 to be derived from\r\nthe sale of the absentee Shawnee lands provided for by the resolution\r\nof Congress approved April 7, 1869.[632] Under the provisions of this\r\nagreement, seven hundred and seventy Shawnees removed to and settled in\r\nthe Cherokee country, as shown by the census roll filed[633] with the\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIENDLY TRIBES TO BE LOCATED ON CHEROKEE LANDS WEST OF 96°.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the provision contained in the treaty of 1866 concerning\r\nthe location of _civilized_ Indians east of 96°, the sixteenth article\r\nof that treaty made further provision enabling the United States to\r\nlocate _friendly_ tribes on Cherokee lands west of that meridian. The\r\nconditions of this concession were that any tracts selected for such\r\nlocation should be in compact form and in quantity not exceeding 160\r\nacres for each member of the tribe so located, and that the boundaries\r\nof the tracts should be surveyed and marked and should be conveyed in\r\nfee simple to the tribes respectively located thereon. It was further\r\nstipulated that the price to be paid for the lands so set apart should\r\nbe such as might be agreed upon between the Cherokees and the immigrant\r\ntribes, subject to the approval of the President of the United States,\r\nwho, in case of a disagreement between the parties in interest, was\r\nauthorized to fix the value.\r\n\r\n_Osages._--The treaty of September 29, 1865,[634] with the Osages,\r\nhaving in view the possibility of some early arrangement whereby the\r\nKansas tribes might be removed to Indian Territory, made provision\r\nthat in case such a removal of the Osages should take place their\r\nremaining lands in Kansas should be disposed of and 50 per cent. of the\r\nproceeds might be applied to the purchase of their new home. Nothing\r\nwas done in the line of carrying out this idea until the spring of\r\n1868, when, in reply[635] to a communication from the Commissioner\r\nof Indian Affairs on the subject, the Cherokee delegation asserted\r\nthe willingness of their nation to dispose of a tract for the future\r\nhome of the Osages not exceeding 600,000 acres in extent and lying\r\nwest of 96°, provided a reasonable price could be agreed upon for\r\nthe same. A few weeks later[636] a treaty was concluded between the\r\nUnited States and the Osages, which made provision for setting apart\r\na tract for their occupation in the district of country in question,\r\nbut the treaty failed of ratification. The necessity for their removal\r\nfrom Kansas, however, increased in correspondence with the demands\r\nof advancing settlements, and Congress, by an act approved July 15,\r\n1870,[637] provided that, whenever the Osages should give their\r\nassent, a tract should be set apart for their permanent occupancy in\r\nthe Indian Territory equal in extent to 160 acres for each member of\r\nthe tribe who should remove there. For this tract they were to pay a\r\nprice not exceeding that paid by the United States, the cost to be\r\ndefrayed out of the proceeds arising from the sale of their Kansas\r\nlands. The assent of the Osages to the provisions of this act was\r\npromptly secured through the medium of a commission consisting of J.\r\nV. Farwell, J. D. Lang, and Vincent Colyer, of the President's Board\r\nof Indian Commissioners. A tract was selected in the Cherokee country\r\nimmediately west of 96°, as was supposed, and the Osages were removed\r\nto it. Their condition was for a time, however, most unsatisfactory.\r\nMany trespassers were found to be upon the lands selected for them.\r\nTo crown this trouble, a new survey located the line of the 96th\r\nmeridian a considerable distance to the west of what had previously\r\nbeen presumed its proper location. This survey deprived the Osages of\r\nthe greater part of the tillable land upon which they had settled and\r\nincluded the most valuable of their improvements. To a proposition\r\nallowing the Osages to retain the lands thus found to be east of 96°,\r\nthe Cherokees returned an emphatic refusal, on the ground that the\r\nformer were not \"civilized Indians.\"[638] Another subject of annoyance\r\nwas the inability of the Osages and Cherokees to agree upon a price\r\nfor the lands selected by the former. The matter was therefore laid\r\nbefore the President, who, by executive order,[639] fixed the price to\r\nbe paid at 50 cents per acre. To this action the Cherokees strenuously\r\nobjected, urging that not only was the price too low, but that a\r\nuniform valuation ought to be fixed for all the Cherokee lands west\r\nof 96°.[640] To remedy the evils arising from these complications,\r\nlegislation was asked of Congress approving a new selection for\r\nthe Osages, and, by act approved June 5, 1872,[641] such selection\r\nwas affirmed (the previous consent of the Cherokees having been\r\nobtained),[642] to include the tract of country \"bounded on the east by\r\nthe 96th meridian, on the south and west by the north line of the Creek\r\ncountry and the main channel of the Arkansas River, and on the north by\r\nthe south line of the State of Kansas.\"\r\n\r\n_Kansas or Kaws._--This act contained a proviso that the Osages should\r\npermit the settlement within the limits of this tract of the Kansas\r\nor Kaw tribe of Indians, and a reservation was accordingly set off\r\nfor them in the northwest corner, bounded on the west by the Arkansas\r\nRiver. The area of the country thus assigned to the Kaws was 100,137\r\nacres, and of that portion intended for the occupation of the Osages\r\n1,470,059 acres.[643]\r\n\r\nThe question of the future location of these Indians having been\r\ndefinitely settled, it only remained for an agreement to be reached\r\nconcerning the price to be paid to the Cherokees for the tract so\r\npurchased. The value fixed by the President on the tract originally\r\nselected was considered as having no application to the lands set apart\r\nby the act of 1872. As in the first instance no agreement was reached\r\nbetween the Osages and Cherokees, and the President was again called\r\non to establish the price. This he did, after much discussion of the\r\nsubject, on the 14th of February, 1873. The price fixed was 70 cents\r\nper acre, and applied to the \"Kaw reserve\" as well as to that of the\r\nOsages.\r\n\r\n_Pawnees._--In further pursuance of the privilege accorded by the\r\ntreaty of 1866, the Pawnee tribe has also been located on Cherokee\r\nlands west of 96°. The Pawnees are natives of Nebraska, and possessed\r\nas the remnant of their original domain a reservation on the Platte\r\nRiver, in that State. Their principal reliance as a food supply had\r\nbeen the buffalo, though to a very limited extent they cultivated corn\r\nand vegetables.\r\n\r\nFor two years prior to 1874, however, their efforts in the chase were\r\nalmost wholly unrewarded, and during the summer of that year their\r\nsmall crops were entirely destroyed by the ravages of the grasshoppers.\r\nThe winter and spring of 1874-'75 found them, to the number of about\r\nthree thousand, in a starving condition. In this dilemma they held a\r\ncouncil and voted to remove to Indian Territory, asking permission\r\nat the same time to send the male portion of the tribe in advance to\r\nselect a home and to break the necessary ground for planting crops.\r\nThey also voted a request that the United States should proceed to\r\nsell their reserve in Nebraska, and thus secure funds for their proper\r\nestablishment in the Indian Territory. Permission was granted them in\r\naccordance with their request, and legislation was asked of Congress\r\nto enable the desired arrangement to be carried into effect. Congress\r\nfailed to take any action in relation to the subject during the session\r\nending March 3, 1875. It therefore became necessary to feed the Pawnees\r\nduring the ensuing season.[644]\r\n\r\nThe following year, by an act approved April 10,[645] Congress provided\r\nfor the sale of the Pawnee lands in Nebraska, as a means of securing\r\nfunds for their relief and establishment in their new home, the\r\nboundaries of which are therein described. It consists of a tract of\r\ncountry in the forks of the Arkansas and Cimarron Rivers comprising an\r\narea of 283,020 acres. Of this tract, 230,014 acres were originally a\r\nportion of the Cherokee domain west of 96° and were paid for at the\r\nrate of 70 cents per acre. The remainder was ceded to the United States\r\nby the Creek treaty of 1866.\r\n\r\n_Appraisal of the lands west of 96°._--By the 5th section of the\r\nIndian appropriation act of May 29, 1872,[646] the President of the\r\nUnited States was authorized to cause an appraisement to be made of\r\nthat portion of the Cherokee lands lying west of 96° west longitude\r\nand west of the Osage lands, or, in other words, all of the Cherokee\r\nlands lying west of the Arkansas River and south of Kansas mentioned\r\nin the 16th article of the Cherokee treaty of July 19, 1866. No\r\nappropriation, however, was made to defray the expense of such an\r\nappraisal, and in consequence no steps were taken toward a compliance\r\nwith the terms of the act. This legislation was had in deference to the\r\nlong continued complaints of the Cherokees that the United States had,\r\nwithout their consent, appropriated to the use of other tribes a large\r\nportion of these lands, for which they (the Cherokees) had received no\r\ncompensation. The history of these alleged unlawful appropriations of\r\nthe Cherokee domain may be thus briefly summarized:\r\n\r\n1. By treaty of October 18, 1865,[647] with the Kiowas and Comanches,\r\nthe United States set apart for their use and occupancy an immense\r\ntract of country, which in part included all of the Cherokee country\r\nwest of the Cimarron River. No practical effect, however, was given to\r\nthe treaty, because the United States had not at this time acquired any\r\nlegal right to settle other tribes on the lands of the Cherokees and\r\nbecause of the fact that two years later[648] a new reservation was by\r\ntreaty provided for the Kiowas and Comanches, no portion of which was\r\nwithin the Cherokee limits.\r\n\r\n2. By the treaty of October 28, 1867,[649] with the Southern Cheyennes\r\nand Arapahoes the United States undertook to set apart as a reservation\r\nfor their benefit all the country between the State of Kansas and\r\nthe Arkansas and Cimarron Rivers. The bulk of this tract was within\r\nCherokee limits west of 96°. As a matter of fact, however, the\r\nCheyennes and Arapahoes could not be prevailed upon to take possession\r\nof this tract, and were finally, by Executive order,[650] located on\r\nterritory to the southwest and entirely outside the Cherokee limits.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the act of May 29, 1872,[651] the Commissioner of Indian\r\nAffairs negotiated an agreement with the Southern Cheyennes and\r\nArapahoes in the following autumn[652] by which they ceded to the\r\nUnited States all interest in the country set apart by the treaty of\r\n1867, and accepted in lieu thereof a reserve which included within its\r\nlimits a portion of the Cherokee domain lying between the Cimarron\r\nRiver and the North Fork of the Canadian.\r\n\r\nThis agreement with the Southern Cheyennes and Arapahoes not having\r\nbeen ratified by Congress, an agreement was concluded late in the\r\nfollowing year[653] by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs with both\r\nthe Cheyennes and the Arapahoes, whereby they jointly ceded the tract\r\nassigned them by the treaty of 1867, as well as all other lands to\r\nwhich they had any claim in Indian Territory, in consideration of which\r\nthe United States agreed to set apart other lands in that Territory for\r\ntheir future home.\r\n\r\nLike its predecessor, this agreement also failed of ratification by\r\nCongress, and the Indians affected by it still occupy the tract set\r\napart by Executive order of 1869.\r\n\r\nIn the light of these facts it appears that although the United States\r\nmade several attempts, without the knowledge or concurrence of the\r\nCherokees, to appropriate portions of the latter's domain to the use\r\nof other tribes, yet as a matter of fact these tribes never availed\r\nor attempted to avail themselves of the benefits thus sought to be\r\nsecured to them, and the Cherokees were not deprived at any time of\r\nan opportunity to sell any portion of their surplus domain for the\r\nlocation of other friendly tribes.\r\n\r\nBy a clause contained in the sundry civil appropriation act of July\r\n31, 1876,[654] provision was made for defraying the expenses of the\r\ncommission of appraisal contemplated by the act of 1872, and the\r\nSecretary of the Interior appointed[655] such a commission, consisting\r\nof Thomas V. Kennard, Enoch H. Topping, and Thomas E. Smith. Before\r\nthe completion of the duties assigned them, Mr. Kennard resigned and\r\nWilliam N. Wilkerson was appointed[656] to succeed him. The commission\r\nconvened at Lawrence, Kansas, and proceeded thence to the Cherokee\r\ncountry, where they began the work of examination and appraisal. Their\r\nfinal report was submitted to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs\r\nunder date of December 12, 1877. From this report it appears that the\r\ncommissioners in fixing their valuations adopted as the standard of\r\ntheir appraisal one-half the actual value of the lands, on the theory\r\nthat being for Indian occupancy and settlement only they were worth\r\nonly about half as much as they would have been if open to entry and\r\nsettlement by the white people.\r\n\r\nThe entire tract, including the Pawnee reserve, contains 6,574,576.05\r\nacres, and was appraised at an average valuation of 41-1/4 cents\r\nper acre. The average valuation placed upon the Pawnee reserve\r\nseparately was 59 cents per acre, leaving the average of the remaining\r\n6,344,562.01 acres 40.47 cents per acre.\r\n\r\nTo this standard of appraisal the Cherokees strenuously objected as\r\nbeing most unfair and unjust to them, claiming that the same measure\r\nof value used by the United States in rating its lands of a similar\r\ncharacter in the adjoining State of Kansas, and from which they were\r\nseparated only by an imaginary line, should prevail in determining the\r\nprice to be paid for the Cherokee lands.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior, after a careful examination of the whole\r\nsubject, was of the opinion[657] that the restriction placed upon the\r\nuse of these lands (being limited to Indian occupancy only) did not\r\nwarrant a reduction of 50 per cent. in an appraisal of their value.\r\n\r\nThe price paid by the Osages for their reserve was 70 cents per acre.\r\nThe Pawnee tract was of about the same general character as that of\r\nthe Osages, and there seemed to be no good reason why the same price\r\nshould not be allowed to the Cherokees therefor. This Pawnee tract was\r\nappraised by the commissioners at 59 cents per acre. As the appraisal\r\nof the whole unoccupied country west of 96° was made by the same\r\nappraisers and upon the same basis, if an increase was determined upon\r\nin the case of the Pawnee tract from 59 to 70 cents per acre, it was\r\nonly just that a proportionate increase above the appraised value of\r\nthe remainder of the lands should also be allowed. This would give\r\nan increase for the latter from 40.47 cents to 47.49 per acre. The\r\nadoption of this standard was therefore recommended to the President\r\nand was by him approved and ratified.[658]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Osages, Kansas, and Pawnees there have been removed\r\nto the Cherokee lands west of 96° the Poncas, a portion of the Nez\r\nPercés, and the Otoes and Missourias.\r\n\r\n_Poncas._--An appropriation of $25,000 was made by act of Congress\r\napproved August 15, 1876,[659] for the removal of the Poncas, whenever\r\ntheir assent should be obtained. After much trouble and a threatened\r\nresort to military force, their assent to remove to the Indian\r\nTerritory was secured in the beginning of 1877.[660] They came overland\r\nfrom Nebraska in two different parties and encountered great hardships,\r\nbut finally reached the Territory, where they were temporarily located\r\non the northeast portion of the Quapaw reserve, a few miles from Baxter\r\nSprings, Kansas.[661]\r\n\r\nThey were not satisfied with the location, which was in many\r\nrespects unsuitable, especially in view of its proximity to the\r\nwhite settlements. They were, therefore, permitted to make another\r\nselection, which they did in the Cherokee country, on the west bank of\r\nthe Arkansas, including both banks of the Salt Fork at its junction\r\nwith the parent stream. To this new home they removed in 1878,[662]\r\nbut it was not until 1881[663] that Congress made an appropriation out\r\nof which to pay the Cherokees for the land so occupied. This tract\r\nembraces 101,894.31 acres, for which the price of 47.49 cents per acre,\r\nfixed by the President, was paid.\r\n\r\n_Nez Percés._--The Nez Percés, previously alluded to, are the remnant\r\nof Chief Joseph's band, who surrendered to General Miles in 1877.\r\nThey were at first removed from the place of their surrender to\r\nFort Leavenworth, Kansas, where they arrived in November of that\r\nyear as prisoners of war, to the number of 431. Congress having\r\nmade provision[664] for their settlement in the Indian Territory, a\r\nreservation was selected for them on both sides of the Salt Fork of\r\nthe Arkansas. To this tract, which adjoined the Poncas on the west,\r\nthey removed in the summer of 1879,[665] having in the mean time lost a\r\nlarge number by death, the mortality being occasioned in great measure\r\nby their unsanitary location while at Fort Leavenworth. The reserve\r\nselected for them contains 90,735 acres and was paid for at the same\r\nprice as that of the Poncas.\r\n\r\n_Otoes and Missourias._--By act of March 3, 1881,[663] provision was\r\nalso made for the removal of the Otoes and Missourias to the Indian\r\nTerritory and for the sale of their lands in Nebraska.\r\n\r\nA reservation was accordingly selected for them, west of the Arkansas\r\nRiver and south of the Ponca Reserve, to which they were removed in the\r\nautumn of the same year[666]. It contains 129,113.20 acres and was paid\r\nfor at the same rate as that of the Poncas and Nez Percés.[667]\r\n\r\n\r\nEAST AND NORTH BOUNDARIES OF CHEROKEE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\nFor many years there had been much doubt and dispute concerning the\r\ncorrectness of the boundary line between the Cherokee Nation and the\r\nadjacent States. Especially had this been the cause of much controversy\r\nwith the citizens of Arkansas. In the interest of a final adjustment\r\nof the matter, it was stipulated in the twenty-first article of the\r\nCherokee treaty of July 19, 1866, that the United States should, at its\r\nown expense, cause such boundary to be resurveyed between the Cherokee\r\nNation and the States of Arkansas, Missouri, and of Kansas as far west\r\nas the Arkansas River, and the same should be marked by permanent and\r\nconspicuous monuments by two commissioners, one of whom should be\r\ndesignated by the Cherokee national council.\r\n\r\nNothing definite was done in pursuance of this provision until the\r\nyear 1871, when W. D. Gallagher was[668] appointed a commissioner on\r\nbehalf of the United States to co-operate with the commissioner on the\r\npart of the Cherokees. Mr. Gallagher declined and R. G. Corwin was\r\nsubstituted in his stead[669], but he having also refused to serve, the\r\nplace was finally filled by the appointment[670] of James M. Ashley.\r\nThe Cherokee national council on their part selected John Lynch Adair.\r\nThe commission advertised for proposals for the surveying, and, as a\r\nresult, entered into contract with D. P. Mitchell, who completed the\r\nsurvey to the satisfaction of the commissioners.[671] The new line from\r\nFort Smith, Ark., to the southwest corner of Missouri ran north 7° 50'\r\nwest, 77 miles 39.08 chains; thence to the southeast corner of the\r\nSeneca lands it ran north 0° 02' west, 8 miles 53.68 chains. The north\r\nboundary between the nation and the State of Kansas, extending from the\r\nNeosho to the Arkansas River, was protracted due west on the 37° of\r\nnorth latitude and was found to be 105 miles 60 chains and 75 links in\r\nlength. The report of the commissioners was approved by the Secretary\r\nof the Interior, and although some distress for the time being was\r\noccasioned to individual settlers, whose improvements were by the\r\nresurvey of the line thrown within the limits of the Indian Territory,\r\nthe boundary has been so plainly marked that \"he who runs may read.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRAILROADS THROUGH INDIAN TERRITORY.\r\n\r\nThe series of treaties concluded in 1866 with the five principal\r\ntribes in Indian Territory all contained limited concessions of right\r\nof way for railroads through their country to the State of Texas. The\r\neleventh article of the Cherokee treaty contained a grant of right of\r\nway 200 feet in width to a contemplated railroad through their domain\r\nfrom north to south and also from east to west. In pursuance of these\r\ntreaty concessions, as essentially a part of the same scheme, Congress,\r\nby appropriate legislation,[672] granted public lands and privileges\r\nto the Kansas and Neosho, the southern branch of the Union Pacific,\r\nand the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad Companies, respectively, for\r\nthe construction of their roads. The Leavenworth, Lawrence and Fort\r\nGibson Railroad was also conceded like privileges. The stipulated point\r\nof entering the Indian Territory was in each case the west bank of\r\nNeosho River, where it crosses the Kansas line. As there seemed to be\r\nsome question whether more than one line of road would be permitted\r\nto traverse the Territory in each direction a race was inaugurated\r\nbetween all the north and south lines, each in the effort to outstrip\r\nthe other in reaching the prescribed point for entering the Indian\r\ncountry. The Union Pacific Southern Branch (subsequently known as the\r\nMissouri, Kansas, and Texas) Railway Company, in the fervency of their\r\ndesire to reach the line first, omitted the construction of a portion\r\nof their route, and began operations within the limits of the Cherokee\r\ncountry without having received the previous permission of either the\r\nUnited States or the Cherokee authorities so to do. To this conduct the\r\nCherokees made vigorous objection, and appealed to the Secretary of\r\nthe Interior. That officer notified[673] the railroad officials that\r\nthe Cherokees did not recognize their right to so intrude upon the\r\nTerritory, and that no work of the kind referred to could be permitted\r\ntherein until the Executive should be satisfied, by evidence submitted\r\nin proper manner, that such entry and occupation were in accordance\r\nwith law. Thereupon the officers and attorneys of the several companies\r\ninterested appeared and submitted arguments before the Secretary of the\r\nInterior on behalf of their respective interests. The point submitted\r\nfor the consideration of the Secretary and for the determination of\r\nthe President was, what rights had been given to railroad companies to\r\nconstruct railroads through the Indian Territory and what railroads, if\r\nany, were entitled to such privileges and right of way.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the Indians it was claimed that the whole scheme of\r\ntreaties and of legislation looked to the construction of but a\r\nsingle trunk road through the Territory from north to south, and, as\r\nfar as the Cherokee Nation was concerned, for the like construction\r\nof but a single road through its territory from east to west. This\r\ninterpretation of the treaties and the laws was admitted to be the\r\ncorrect one by all the companies but the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas.\r\nThis company insisted that the meaning of the legislation and of the\r\ntreaties was to give the right of way to as many roads as might in any\r\nmanner be authorized by Congress to enter the Territory.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of the Interior in his opinion[674] expressed an emphatic\r\nconcurrence in the interpretation insisted upon by the Cherokee\r\ndelegation. He was further of the opinion that neither of the roads had\r\nso far earned a right to enter the Indian country by the construction\r\nof a continuous line of road to the legal point of entrance, but that\r\nas it might soon be necessary to decide which company should first\r\ncompletely fulfill the conditions of the law, an executive order ought\r\nto be issued declaring that no railroad company should be permitted\r\nto enter the Territory for the purpose of grading or constructing a\r\nrailroad until a report should be received from a commission composed\r\nof the superintendents of Indian affairs for the central and southern\r\nsuperintendencies designating which company had first reached the line.\r\nThese views and findings of the Secretary of the Interior were approved\r\nby the President and directed to be carried into effect.[675]\r\n\r\nThis commission reported[676] that the Union Pacific Railway, southern\r\nbranch--otherwise the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway--reached\r\nthe northern boundary of the Indian Territory, in the valley of the\r\nNeosho River on the west side, and about one mile therefrom, at noon\r\non the 6th day of June, 1870, and that at that time there was no other\r\nrailroad nearer than 16 miles of that point.\r\n\r\nPredicated upon this report, supplemented by the certificate of the\r\ngovernor of Kansas that it was a first class completed railway up\r\nto that point, permission was given the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas\r\nRailway Company by the President, under certain stipulations and\r\nrestrictions as to the methods and character of construction, to\r\nproceed with the work of building a trunk road through the Indian\r\nTerritory to a point at or near Preston, in the State of Texas, and the\r\nroad was rapidly constructed under this authority.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic and Pacific road, having no competitor, experienced no\r\ndifficulty in securing the right of construction of its east and west\r\nline through the Cherokee country.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF INTRUDERS--CHEROKEE CITIZENSHIP.\r\n\r\nOn various pretexts, both white and colored men had from time to\r\ntime established themselves among the Cherokees and taken up their\r\nresidence as permanent citizens of the nation. The increase of their\r\nnumbers at length became so formidable and their influence upon the\r\nnational polity and legislation of the Cherokees so great as to excite\r\nthe apprehension and jealousy of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe policy of their removal therefore became a subject of serious\r\nconsideration with the national council. This involved a question as\r\nto what were the essential prerequisites of Cherokee citizenship,\r\nand who of the objectionable class were entitled, on any score, to\r\nthe privileges of such citizenship, as well as who were mere naked\r\nintruders. Upon these points the national council assumed to exercise\r\nabsolute control, and proceeded to enact laws for the removal of all\r\npersons, both white and colored, whom the council should declare not\r\nentitled to remain in the Cherokee country.[677] The action of the\r\ncouncil in this respect was communicated to the Indian Department in\r\nthe fall of 1874, through the United States agent for that tribe,\r\ncoupled with a demand for the removal by the military force of the\r\nUnited States of all who had thus been declared to be intruders. The\r\nDepartment not being fully satisfied of the justice of this demand,\r\ndetailed an inspector to proceed to the Indian country and make a\r\nthorough investigation of the subject. His report[678] revealed the\r\nfact that there were large numbers of people in that country who had\r\nbeen declared intruders by the national authorities, but who had\r\npresented to him strong _ex parte_ evidence of their right to Cherokee\r\ncitizenship, either by blood, by adoption, or under the terms of the\r\n9th article of the treaty of 1866 defining the status of colored\r\npeople. Affidavits in large numbers corroborative of the inspector's\r\nreport continued to be filed in the Indian Department during the\r\nsucceeding summer, from which it appeared that many persons belonging\r\nto each of the classes alluded to had applied to the courts or to\r\nthe council of the nation for an affirmative ruling upon their claim\r\nto citizenship, but that in many instances such applications had\r\nbeen entirely ignored. In other cases, where the courts had actually\r\naffirmed the right of applicants, the council had arbitrarily and\r\nwithout notice placed their names upon the list of intruders and called\r\nupon the United States for their removal. In this situation of affairs\r\nthe Indian Department advised[679] the principal chief of the Cherokees\r\nthat the Department would neither remove these alleged intruders nor\r\npermit their removal until the Cherokee council had devised a system\r\nof rules by which authority should be vested in the Cherokee courts to\r\nhear and determine all cases involving the citizenship of any person.\r\nThese rules should be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the\r\nInterior, to whom an appeal should also lie from any adverse decision\r\nof those courts. As there were a number of these intruders, however,\r\nwho made no claim to the right of Cherokee citizenship, it was directed\r\nby the Interior Department, in the spring of 1877, that all who should\r\nnot present _prima facie_ evidence of such right should be summarily\r\nremoved from the Territory. The main cause of difficulty, however,\r\ncontinuing unadjusted, the principal chief of the Cherokees asked\r\nthe submission of the subject, from the Cherokee standpoint, to the\r\nAttorney-General of the United States for his opinion. This was done in\r\nthe spring of 1879,[680] by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs through\r\nthe Secretary of the Interior, wherein the former, alleging that the\r\nquestion submitted by the Cherokee authorities did not fully meet the\r\nsubject in dispute, and being desirous that a complete statement of\r\nthe case should be presented to the Attorney-General, suggested three\r\nadditional inquiries for the consideration of that officer. These\r\ninquiries were, first, Have the Cherokee national authorities such\r\noriginal right of sovereignty over their country and their people as to\r\nvest in them the exclusive jurisdiction of all questions of citizenship\r\nin that nation without reference to the paramount authority of the\r\nUnited States? Second, If not, do they derive any such power or right\r\nby the provisions of any of the treaties between the United States and\r\nthe Cherokees? Third, Can they exclude from citizenship any of the\r\nCherokees who did not remove under the provisions of the treaty of 1835\r\nupon their removal to the Cherokee country as now defined by law? The\r\nreply[681] of the Attorney-General was to the effect that it seemed\r\nquite plain in executing such treaties as those with the Cherokees, the\r\nUnited States were not bound to regard simply the Cherokee law and its\r\nconstruction by the council of that nation, but that any Department\r\nrequired to remove alleged intruders must determine for itself, under\r\nthe general law of the land, the existence and extent of the exigency\r\nupon which such requisition was founded.\r\n\r\nOne class of these so-called intruders, as previously suggested, was\r\ncomposed of colored people who resided in the Cherokee country prior to\r\nthe war, either as slaves or freemen, and their descendants.\r\n\r\nThe fourth article of the treaty of July 19, 1866, contained a\r\nprovision setting apart a tract within the Cherokee country known as\r\nthe Canadian district, for the settlement and occupancy of \"all the\r\nCherokees and freed persons who were formerly slaves of any Cherokee,\r\nand all free negroes not having been such slaves who resided in the\r\nCherokee Nation prior to June 1, 1861, who may within two years elect\r\nnot to reside northeast of the Arkansas River and southeast of Grand\r\nRiver.\"\r\n\r\nThe fifth article of the same treaty guaranteed to such persons as\r\nshould determine to reside in the district thus set apart the right\r\nto select their own local officers, judges, etc., and to manage and\r\ncontrol their local affairs in such manner as seemed most satisfactory\r\nto them not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the Cherokee\r\nNation or of the United States. Again it was provided by the ninth\r\narticle of the treaty that all freedmen who had been liberated by\r\nvoluntary act of their former owners or by law, as well as all free\r\ncolored persons who were in the country at the commencement of the\r\nrebellion and were still residents therein or who should return within\r\nsix months and their descendants, should have all the rights of native\r\nCherokees.\r\n\r\nCongressional legislation was sought in 1879, having in view the\r\nenforcement of this ninth article, but it failed of consummation.[682]\r\nThe Cherokee council, in the mean time had passed[683] an act urging\r\nupon the United States the adoption of some measures calculated\r\nto reach a satisfactory adjustment of the status of the colored\r\npeople within their jurisdiction, and requested the attendance of\r\nsome properly authorized representative of the Government at their\r\nensuing council for consultation as to the most satisfactory method\r\nof settling the vexed question. United States Indian Agent Tufts was\r\naccordingly instructed[684] to attend the council, which he did. It\r\nresulted in the passage[685] of an act by that body authorizing the\r\nprincipal chief to appoint a commission of three Cherokees to confer\r\nwith the United States agent and draft articles of agreement, which\r\nshould, after receiving the approval of the council and of Congress,\r\nbe considered as permanently fixing the status of the colored people.\r\nThe agent, however, soon discovered that no action looking to the full\r\nrecognition of the rights to which they were entitled was likely to\r\nreceive favorable consideration. It seems from his report[686] that\r\nit was still very unpopular in the Cherokee Nation to advocate any\r\nmeasure conceding to the colored people the same rights enjoyed by the\r\nCherokees themselves, and that until a radical revolution of public\r\nsentiment should take place among them it was useless to expect any\r\nfavorable action from the national council. Agent Tufts concluded his\r\nreport with a recommendation that a commission be appointed By the\r\nInterior Department and instructed to hold sessions in the Cherokee\r\ncountry, hear evidence, and determine the status of each disputed\r\nclaimant to citizenship, subject to the final revision and approval of\r\nthe Department. Inspector Ward and Special Agent Beede were, therefore,\r\ninstructed[687] to consult with Agent Tufts, and, after familiarizing\r\nthemselves with the question in all its details, to visit the executive\r\nofficers of the Cherokee Nation and see if some satisfactory solution\r\nof the troublesome problem could be brought about. This conference,\r\nlike all previous efforts, failed of accomplishing the desired end.\r\nThus the question still stands, and all those persons who have been\r\nable to make out a _prima facie_ showing of Cherokee citizenship, under\r\nthe ruling of the Department, are allowed to remain in the Territory\r\nunmolested.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL REMARKS.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of these questions and complications arising out\r\nof the construction of the various articles of the treaty of July 19,\r\n1866, nothing of an important character has occurred in connection with\r\nthe official relations between the Cherokee Nation and the Federal\r\nGovernment since the date of that treaty.\r\n\r\nTheir history has been an eventful one. For two hundred years a contest\r\ninvolving their very existence as a people has been maintained against\r\nthe unscrupulous rapacity of Anglo-Saxon civilization. By degrees they\r\nwere driven from their ancestral domain to an unknown and inhospitable\r\nregion. The country of their fathers was peculiarly dear to them.\r\nIt embraced the head springs of many of the most important streams\r\nof the country. From the summit of their own Blue Ridge they could\r\nwatch the tiny rivulets on either side of them dashing and bounding\r\nover their rocky beds in their eagerness to join and swell the ever\r\nincreasing volume of waters rolling toward the Atlantic Ocean or the\r\nGulf of Mexico: the Tennessee and the Cumberland, the Kanawha and the\r\nKentucky, the Peedee and the Santee, the Savannah and the Altamaha,\r\nthe Chattahoochee and the Alabama, all found their beginnings within\r\nthe Cherokee domain. The bracing and invigorating atmosphere of their\r\nmountains was wafted to the valleys and low lands of their more distant\r\nborders, tempering the heat and destroying the malaria. Much of their\r\ncountry was a succession of grand mountains, clothed with dense\r\nforests; of beautiful but narrow valleys, and extensive well watered\r\nplains. Every nook and corner of this vast territory was endeared to\r\nthem by some incident of hunter, warrior, or domestic life. Over these\r\nhills and through the recesses of the dark forests the Cherokee hunter\r\nhad from time immemorial pursued the deer, elk, and buffalo. Through\r\nand over them he had passed on his long and vengeful journeys against\r\nthe hated Iroquois and Shawnee.\r\n\r\nThe blood of his ancestors, as well as of his enemies, could be\r\ntrailed from the Hiwassee to the Ohio. The trophies of his skill and\r\nvalor adorned the sides of his wigwam and furnished the theme for his\r\nboastful oratory and song around the council fire and at the dance. His\r\nwants were few and purely of a physical nature. His life was devoted\r\nto the work of securing a sufficiency of food and the punishment of\r\nhis enemies. His reputation among his fellow men was proportioned\r\nto the skill with which he could draw the bow, his cleverness and\r\nagility in their simple athletic sports, or the keen and tireless\r\nmanner that characterized his pursuit of an enemy's trail. His life\r\nwas simple, his wants were easily supplied; and, in consequence, the\r\nlargest measure of his existence was spent in indolence and frivolous\r\namusements. Such proportion of the family food as the chase did not\r\nsupply was found in the cultivation of Indian corn. The pride of a\r\nwarrior scorned the performance of menial labor, and to the squaw\r\nwas this drudgery, as well as that of the household, assigned. His\r\ngeneral character has been much misunderstood and misrepresented. He\r\nwas in fact possessed of great ingenuity, keen wit, and rare cunning.\r\nIn the consideration of matters of public importance, his conduct was\r\ncharacterized by a grave dignity that was frequently almost ludicrous.\r\nThe studied stolidity of his countenance gave the spectator no clew to\r\nthe inward bent of his feelings or determination. The anxious prisoner,\r\nfrom a watchful study of his face and actions, could read nothing of\r\nhis probable fate. He was physically brave, and would without hesitancy\r\nattack the most dangerous beasts of the forests or his still more\r\nferocious human enemies. In the hands of those enemies he would endure,\r\nwith the most unflinching nerve, the cruelest tortures their ingenuity\r\ncould devise, and at the same time chant his death song in the recital\r\nof his numerous personal acts of triumph over them.\r\n\r\nHis methods of warfare were, however, very different from those which\r\nmeet the approval of civilized nations. He could not understand that\r\nthere was anything of merit in meeting his antagonist in the open\r\nfield, where the chances of victory were nearly equal. It was a useless\r\nrisk of his life, even though his numbers exceeded those of his enemy,\r\nto allow them to become advised of his approach. His movements were\r\nstealthy, and his blows fell at an unexpected moment from the hidden\r\nambush or in the dead hours of the night. His nature was cruel, and in\r\nthe excitement of battle that cruelty was clothed in the most terrible\r\nforms. He was in the highest degree vindictive, and his memory never\r\nlost sight of a personal injury. He was inclined to be credulous until\r\nonce deceived, after which nothing could remove his jealous distrust.\r\n\r\nHis confidence once fully secured, however, the unselfishness of his\r\nfriendship as a rule would put to shame that of his more civilized\r\nAnglo-Saxon brother. His scrupulous honor in the payment of a just\r\ndebt was of a character not always emulated among commercial nations.\r\nHis noble qualities have not been granted the general recognition they\r\ndeserve, and his ignoble traits have oftentimes been glossed over with\r\nthe varnish of an unhealthy sentimentality.[688]\r\n\r\nFor many years following his first contact with the whites the daily\r\nlife of the Cherokee underwent but little change. The remoteness of\r\nhis villages from the coast settlements and the intervening territory\r\nof other tribes limited in large degree any frequency of association\r\nwith his white neighbors. In spite of this restricted intercourse,\r\nhowever, the superior comforts and luxuries of civilization were early\r\napparent to him. His new-found desires met with a ready supply through\r\nthe enterprising cupidity of the fur traders. At the same time and\r\nthrough the same means he was brought to a knowledge of the uses and\r\ncomforts of calico and blankets, and the devastating though seductive\r\ninfluence of spirituous liquors. Yet nothing occurred to mar the peace\r\nhitherto existing with his white neighbors until their continued\r\nspread and seemingly insatiate demand for more territory aroused a\r\nfeeling of jealous fear in his bosom. This awakening to the perils\r\nof his situation was, unfortunately for him, too late. The strength\r\nof the invaders already surpassed his own, and henceforth it was but\r\na struggle against fate. Prior to the close of the Revolutionary\r\nwar but little, if anything, had been done toward encouraging the\r\nCherokee to adopt the customs and pursuits of civilized life. His\r\nnative forests and streams had afforded him a sufficiency of flesh,\r\nfish, and skins to supply all his reasonable wants. Immediately upon\r\nthe establishment of American Independence the policy to be pursued\r\nby the Government in its relations with the Indian tribes became the\r\nsubject of grave consideration. The necessity began to be apparent of\r\nteaching the proximate tribes to cultivate the soil as a substitute\r\nfor the livelihood hitherto gained through the now rapidly diminishing\r\nsupplies of game. In the report of the commissioners appointed to\r\nnegotiate the treaty of 1785, being the first treaty concluded between\r\nthe Cherokees and the United States, they remark that some compensation\r\nshould be made to the Indians for certain of their lands unlawfully\r\ntaken possession of by the whites, and that the sum so raised should\r\nbe appropriated to the purpose of teaching them useful branches of\r\nmechanics. Furthermore, that some of their women had lately learned to\r\nspin, and many others were \"very desirous that some method should be\r\nfallen on to teach them to raise flax, cotton, and wool, as well as to\r\nspin and weave it.\"\r\n\r\nSix years later, in the conclusion of the second treaty with them, it\r\nwas agreed, in order \"that the Cherokee Nation may be led to a greater\r\ndegree of civilization, and to become herdsmen and cultivators instead\r\nof remaining in a state of hunters, the United States will from time\r\nto time furnish gratuitously the said nation with useful implements of\r\nhusbandry.\" From this time forward the progress of the Cherokees in\r\ncivilization and enlightenment was rapid and continuous.[689] They had\r\nmade such advancement that, nearly thirty years later,[690] Return J.\r\nMeigs, their long time agent and friend, represented to the Secretary\r\nof War that such Government assistance was no longer necessary or\r\ndesirable; that the Cherokees were perfectly competent to take care of\r\nthemselves, and that further contributions to their support only had a\r\ntendency to encourage idleness and dependence upon the Government.\r\n\r\nTheir country was especially adapted to stock raising and their\r\nflocks and herds increased in proportion to the zeal and industry\r\nof their owners. The proceeds of their surplus cotton placed within\r\nreach most of the comforts and many of the luxuries of life. The\r\nunselfish devotion of the missionary societies had furnished them with\r\nreligious and school instruction, of which they had in large numbers\r\neagerly availed themselves.[691] From the crude tribal government of\r\nthe eighteenth century they had gradually progressed until in the\r\nmonth of July, 1827, a convention of duly elected delegates from the\r\neight several districts into which their country was divided[692]\r\nassembled at New Echota, and announced that \"We, the representatives\r\nof the people of the Cherokee Nation, in convention assembled, in\r\norder to establish justice, insure tranquillity, promote our common\r\nwelfare, and secure to ourselves and our posterity the blessings of\r\nliberty, acknowledging with humility and gratitude the goodness of\r\nthe sovereign Ruler of the Universe in offering us an opportunity so\r\nfavorable to the design and imploring His aid and direction in its\r\naccomplishment, do ordain and establish this constitution for the\r\ngovernment of the Cherokee Nation.\" By the constitution thus adopted\r\nthe power of the nation was divided into legislative, executive, and\r\njudicial departments. The legislative power was vested in a committee\r\nand a council, each to have a negative on the other, and together to\r\nbe called the \"General Council of the Cherokee Nation.\" This committee\r\nconsisted of two and the council of three members from each district,\r\nand were to be elected biennially by the suffrages of all free male\r\ncitizens (excepting negroes and descendants of white and Indian men by\r\nnegro women who may have been set free) who had attained the age of\r\neighteen years. Their sessions were annual, beginning on the second\r\nMonday in October. Persons of negro or mulatto blood were declared\r\nineligible to official honors or emoluments.\r\n\r\nThe executive power of the nation was confided to a principal chief,\r\nelected by the general council for a term of four years, and none\r\nbut native born citizens were eligible to the office. The chief was\r\nrequired to visit each district of the nation at least once in two\r\nyears, to keep himself familiarized with the condition and necessities\r\nof the country. His approval was also required to all laws, and, as\r\nin the case of our own Government, the exercise of the veto power\r\ncould be overcome only by a two-thirds majority in both houses of the\r\nnational legislature. An executive council of three members besides the\r\nassistant principal chief was also to be elected by the joint vote of\r\nthe two houses for the period of one year.\r\n\r\nThe judicial functions were vested in a supreme court of three judges\r\nand such circuit and inferior courts as the general council should from\r\ntime to time prescribe, such judges to be elected by joint vote of the\r\ngeneral council.\r\n\r\nMinisters of the gospel who by their profession were dedicated to the\r\nservice of God and the care of souls, and who ought not therefore to\r\nbe diverted from the great duty of their function, were, while engaged\r\nin such work, declared ineligible to the office of principal chief or\r\nto a seat in either house of the general council. Any person denying\r\nthe existence of a God or a future state of rewards and punishments\r\nwas declared ineligible to hold any office in the civil department\r\nof the nation, and it was also set forth that (religion, morality,\r\nand knowledge being necessary to good government, the preservation\r\nof liberty, and the happiness of mankind) schools and the means of\r\neducation should forever be encouraged in the nation.\r\n\r\nUnder this constitution elections were regularly held and the\r\nfunctions of government administered until the year 1830, when the\r\nhostile legislation of Georgia practically paralyzed and suspended its\r\nfurther operation. Although forbidden to hold any more elections, the\r\nCherokees maintained a semblance of their republican form of government\r\nby tacitly permitting their last elected officers to hold over and\r\nrecognizing the authority and validity of their official actions. This\r\nembarrassing condition of affairs continued until their removal west of\r\nthe Mississippi River, when, on the 6th of September, 1839, they, in\r\nconjunction with the \"Old Settlers,\" adopted a new constitution, which\r\nin substance was a duplicate of its predecessor.\r\n\r\nThis removal turned the Cherokees back in the calendar of progress\r\nand civilization at least a quarter of a century. The hardships and\r\nexposures of the journey, coupled with the fevers and malaria of a\r\nradically different climate, cost the lives of perhaps 10 per cent\r\nof their total population. The animosities and turbulence born of\r\nthe treaty of 1835 not only occasioned the loss of many lives, but\r\nrendered property insecure, and in consequence diminished the zeal and\r\nindustry of the entire community in its accumulation. A brief period\r\nof comparative quiet, however, was again characterized by an advance\r\ntoward a higher civilization. Five years after their removal we find\r\nfrom the report of their agent that they are again on the increase\r\nin population; that their houses, farms, and fixtures have greatly\r\nimproved in the comforts of life; that in general they are living\r\nin double cabins and evincing an increasing disposition to provide\r\nfor the future; that they have in operation eleven common schools,\r\nsuperintended by a native Cherokee, in which are taught reading,\r\nwriting, arithmetic, bookkeeping, grammar, geography, and history,\r\nwhich are entirely supported at the expense of their own national\r\nfunds, and which are attended by upwards of five hundred scholars;\r\nthat the churches are largely attended and liberally supported, the\r\nMethodists having 1,400 communicants, the Baptists 750, and other\r\ndenominations a smaller number; that a national temperance society\r\nboasts of 1,752 members; that they maintain a printing press, from\r\nwhich publications are issued in both the English and Cherokee tongues;\r\nthat some of them manifest a decided taste for general literature and\r\na few have full and well selected libraries; that thousands of them\r\ncan speak and write the English language with fluency and comparative\r\naccuracy; that hundreds can draw up contracts, deeds, and other\r\ninstruments for the transfer of property, and that in the ordinary\r\ntransactions of life, especially in making bargains, they are shrewd\r\nand intelligent, frequently evincing a remarkable degree of craft\r\nand combination; that their treatment of their women had undergone a\r\nradical change; that the countenance and encouragement given to her\r\ncultivation disclosed a more exalted estimate of female character, and\r\nthat instead of being regarded as a slave and a beast of burden she was\r\nnow recognized as a friend and companion.\r\n\r\nThus, with the exception of occasional drawbacks--the result of\r\ncivil feuds--the progress of the nation in education, industry, and\r\ncivilization continued until the outbreak of the rebellion. At this\r\nperiod, from the best attainable information, the Cherokees numbered\r\ntwenty-one thousand souls. The events of the war brought to them more\r\nof desolation and ruin than perhaps to any other community.\r\n\r\nRaided and sacked alternately, not only by the Confederate and Union\r\nforces, but by the vindictive ferocity and hate of their own factional\r\ndivisions, their country became a blackened and desolate waste. Driven\r\nfrom comfortable homes, exposed to want, misery, and the elements, they\r\nperished like sheep in a snow storm. Their houses, fences, and other\r\nimprovements were burned, their orchards destroyed, their flocks and\r\nherds slaughtered or driven off, their schools broken up, and their\r\nschool-houses given to the flames, their churches and public buildings\r\nsubjected to a similar fate, and that entire portion of their country\r\nwhich had been occupied by their settlements was distinguishable from\r\nthe virgin prairie only by the scorched and blackened chimneys and the\r\nplowed but now neglected fields.\r\n\r\nThe war over and the work of reconstruction commenced, found them\r\nnumbering fourteen thousand impoverished, heart broken, and revengeful\r\npeople. But they must work or starve, and in almost sullen despair\r\nthey set about rebuilding their waste places. The situation was one\r\ncalculated to discourage men enjoying a higher degree of civilization\r\nthan they had yet reached, but they bent to the task with a\r\ndetermination and perseverance that could not fail to be the parent of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nTo-day their country is more prosperous than ever. They number\r\ntwenty-two thousand, a greater population than they have had at any\r\nprevious period, except perhaps just prior to the date of the treaty of\r\n1835, when those east added to those west of the Mississippi are stated\r\nto have aggregated nearly twenty-five thousand people.[693] To-day they\r\nhave twenty-three hundred scholars attending seventy-five schools,\r\nestablished and supported by themselves at an annual expense to the\r\nnation of nearly $100,000. To-day thirteen thousand of their people\r\ncan read and eighteen thousand can speak the English language. To-day\r\nfive thousand brick, frame, and log houses are occupied by them; and\r\nthey have sixty-four churches with a membership of several thousand.\r\nThey cultivate a hundred thousand acres of land and have an additional\r\none hundred and fifty thousand fenced. They raise annually 100,000\r\nbushels of wheat, 800,000 of corn, 100,000 of oats and barley, 27,500\r\nof vegetables, 1,000,000 pounds of cotton, 500,000 pounds of butter,\r\n12,000 tons of hay, and saw a million feet of lumber. They own 20,000\r\nhorses, 15,000 mules, 200,000 cattle, 100,000 swine, and 12,000 sheep.\r\n\r\nThey have a constitutional form of government predicated upon that\r\nof the United States. As a rule, their laws are wise and beneficent\r\nand are enforced with strictness and justice. Political and social\r\nprejudice has deprived the former slaves in some instances of the full\r\nmeasure of rights guaranteed to them by the treaty of 1866 and the\r\namended constitution of the nation, but time is rapidly softening these\r\nasperities and will solve all difficulties of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe present Cherokee population is of a composite character. Remnants\r\nof other nations or tribes have from time to time been absorbed and\r\nadmitted to full participation in the benefits of Cherokee citizenship.\r\nThe various classes may be thus enumerated:\r\n\r\n1. The full blood Cherokees.\r\n\r\n2. The mixed blood Cherokees.\r\n\r\n3. The Delawares.\r\n\r\n4. The Shawnees.\r\n\r\n5. White men and women intermarried with the foregoing.\r\n\r\n6. A few Creeks who broke away from their own tribe and have been\r\ncitizens of the Cherokee Nation for many years.\r\n\r\n7. A few Creeks who are not citizens, but have taken up their abode in\r\nthe Cherokee country, without any rights.\r\n\r\n8. A remnant of the Natchez tribe, who are citizens.\r\n\r\n9. The freedmen adopted under the treaty of 1866.\r\n\r\n10. Freedmen not adopted, but not removed as intruders, owing to an\r\norder from the Indian Department forbidding such removal pending a\r\ndecision upon their claims to citizenship.\r\n\r\nIf the Government of the United States shall in this last resort of the\r\nCherokees prove faithful to its obligations and maintain their country\r\ninviolate from the intrusions of white trespassers, the future of the\r\nnation will surely prove the capability of the American Indian under\r\nfavorable conditions to realize in a high degree the possibilities of\r\nAnglo-Saxon civilization.\r\n\r\n_Table showing approximately the area in square miles and acres ceded\r\nto the United States by the various treaties with the Cherokee Nation:_\r\n\r\n +----------------------+------------------+----------------+----------+\r\n |                      |State where ceded |      Area      | Area in  |\r\n |    Date of treaty.   |lands are located.|    in square   |  acres.  |\r\n |                      |                  |     miles.     |          |\r\n +----------------------+------------------+----------------+----------+\r\n |1721                  |South Carolina    |     2,623      | 1,678,720|\r\n |November 24, 1755     |    do            |     8,635      | 5,526,400|\r\n |October 14, 1768      |Virginia          |       850      |   544,000|\r\n |October 18, 1770     {|    do            |     4,500      | 2,880,000|\r\n |                     {|West Virginia     |     4,300      | 2,752,000|\r\n |                     {|Tennessee         |       150      |    96,000|\r\n |                     {|Kentucky          |       250      |   160,000|\r\n |1772                 {|    do            |    10,135      | 6,486,400|\r\n |                     {|West Virginia     |       437      |   279,680|\r\n |                     {|Virginia          |       345      |   220,800|\r\n |June 1, 1773          |Georgia           |     1,050      |   672,000|\r\n |March 17, 1775       {|Kentucky          |    22,600      |14,464,000|\r\n |                     {|Virginia          |     1,800      | 1,152,000|\r\n |                     {|Tennessee         |     2,650      | 1,696,000|\r\n |May 20, 1777          |South Carolina    |     2,051      | 1,312,640|\r\n |July 20, 1777        {|North Carolina    |     4,414      | 2,824,960|\r\n |                     {|Tennessee         |     1,760      | 1,126,400|\r\n |May 31, 1783          |Georgia           |     1,650      | 1,056,000|\r\n |November 28, 1785    {|North Carolina    |       550      |   352,000|\r\n |                     {|Tennessee         |     4,914      | 3,144,960|\r\n |                     {|Kentucky          |       917      |   586,880|\r\n |July 2, 1791         {|Tennessee         |     3,435      | 2,198,400|\r\n |                     {|North Carolina    |       722      |   462,080|\r\n |October 2, 1798      {|Tennessee         |       952      |   609,280|\r\n |                     {|North Carolina    |       587      |   375,680|\r\n |October 24, 1804      |Georgia           |       135      |    86,400|\r\n |October 25, 1805     {|Kentucky          |     1,086      |   695,040|\r\n |                     {|Tennessee         |     7,032      | 4,500,480|\r\n |October 27, 1805      |    do            |         1-1/4  |       800|\r\n |January 7, 1806      {|    do            |     5,269      | 3,372,160|\r\n |                     {|Alabama           |     1,602      | 1,025,280|\r\n |March 22, 1816        |South Carolina    |       148      |    94,720|\r\n |September 14, 1816   {|Alabama           |     3,129      | 2,194,560|\r\n |                     {|Mississippi       |         4      |     2,560|\r\n |July 8, 1817         {|Georgia           |       583      |   373,120|\r\n |                     {|Tennessee         |       435      |   278,400|\r\n |February 27, 1819    {|Georgia           |       837      |   535,680|\r\n |                     {|Alabama           |     1,154      |   738,560|\r\n |                     {|Tennessee         |     2,408      | 1,541,120|\r\n |                     {|North Carolina    |     1,542      |   986,880|\r\n |May 6, 1828           |Arkansas          |     4,720      | 3,020,800|\r\n |December 29, 1835    {|Tennessee         |     1,484      |   949,760|\r\n |                     {|Georgia           |     7,202      | 4,609,280|\r\n |                     {|Alabama           |     2,518      | 1,611,520|\r\n |                     {|North Carolina    |     1,112      |   711,680|\r\n |July 19, 1866[694]    |Kansas            |[695]1,928      | 1,233,920|\r\n |                      |                  +----------------+----------+\r\n |     Total            |                  |   126,906-1/4  |81,220,374|\r\n +----------------------+------------------+----------------+----------+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY\r\nFIFTH ANNUAL REPORT PL.
