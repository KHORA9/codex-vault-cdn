I knew all or nearly\r\nall the men who made that generation famous: Everett; Charles Sumner,\r\n\"the whitest soul I ever knew,\" said Emerson; Wendell Phillips;\r\nGarrison; Andrew, the greatest of the great \"War Governors\"; Emerson;\r\nWendell Holmes; Theodore Parker; Lowell, and many more; and of all I\r\nshall presently have something to say.  Earlier than any of them\r\ncomes the Reverend Dr. Emmons, a forgotten name, for a long time\r\npastor of the little church in the little town of Franklin, where I\r\nwas born, in Norfolk County, in that State of Massachusetts on which\r\nDaniel Webster pronounced the only possible eulogy: \"I shall enter on\r\nno encomium upon Massachusetts; she needs none.  There she is.\r\nBehold her, and judge for yourselves.  {2} There is her history; the\r\nworld knows it by heart.\"  Whether the world knows it by heart may be\r\na question.  We are perhaps a little too apt to assume that things\r\nAmerican loom as large to other eyes as to our own.  But whether the\r\nworld knows Massachusetts by heart or not, we know it; and the rest\r\ndoes not much matter.  Every son of hers will add for himself \"God\r\nbless her.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Emmons was of the austere school of Calvinists, descending more\r\ndirectly from the still more austere school of Jonathan Edwards.  I\r\ncannot have been more than three or four years old when I last saw\r\nhim, but I see him still: tall, slight, bent, wasted; long grey locks\r\nfloating loosely about his head; his face the face of an ascetic, yet\r\nkindly, and I still feel the gentle touch of the old man's hand as it\r\nrested on my baby head.  And I see the imprint of his venerable feet,\r\nwhich it was his habit to rest on the painted wainscotting of his\r\nsmall, scantily furnished study.\r\n\r\nMy father was first his colleague, then his successor; then was\r\ncalled, as the phrase is, to the Second Congregational Church in\r\nWorcester; whence he passed many years later to the First\r\nPresbyterian Church in Troy, N.Y., where he died.  Worcester was at\r\nthat time--1840 to 1860--a charming example of the thriving New\r\nEngland village which had grown to be a town with pleasant, quiet\r\nstreets--even Main Street, its chief thoroughfare, was quiet--and\r\npleasant houses of colonial and later styles standing in pleasant\r\ngrounds.  A beautiful simplicity of life {3} prevailed, and a high\r\nstandard; without pretence, not without dignity.  The town had given,\r\nand was to give, not a few Governors to the Commonwealth: Governor\r\nLincoln, Governor Davis (\"Honest John\"), another Lieutenant-Governor\r\nDavis, and two Governor Washburns: to the first of whom we lived next\r\ndoor in Pearl Street; in the shadow of the Episcopal Church of which\r\nthe Rev. Dr. Huntington, translated afterward to Grace Church in New\r\nYork and widely known, was rector.  Later I read law for a year in\r\nthe office of Governor Washburn's partner: afterward that Senator\r\nHoar who in learning and capacity stood second to few in Washington,\r\nand in character to none.\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago, my mind filled with these images of almost rural\r\ncharm, I went back on a visit to Worcester.  It had grown to be a\r\ncity of near one hundred thousand people, and unrecognizable.  The\r\ncharm had vanished.  The roar of traffic was to be heard everywhere;\r\nsurface cars raced through the streets; blazing gilt signs with\r\nstrange and often foreign names emblazoned on them in gigantic\r\nletters, plastering and half hiding the fronts of the buildings;\r\nmostly new.  It might have been a section of New York--at any rate it\r\nwas given over to the fierce competition of business.  Of the\r\ntranquillity which once brooded over the town, no trace was left.  I\r\nsuppose it all means prosperity, in which I rejoice; but it was not\r\nmy Worcester.\r\n\r\nIf it be still, as we used affectionately to call it, the Heart of\r\nthe Commonwealth, then I suppose {4} the Commonwealth also has\r\nchanged; for better or for worse, according to your point of view.\r\nBoston certainly has changed, and as certainly for the worse.  Where\r\nis the old Boston we all loved?  What has become of those historic\r\nstreets which the great men of more than one great generation trod?\r\nWhere is the dignity, the quaint, old-fashioned beauty, the stamp of\r\ndistinction, the leisureliness of life, the atmosphere which Winthrop\r\nand Endicott, John Hancock and Otis, Everett and Andrew, once\r\nbreathed?  The only Boston they knew is to-day a city of tumult and\r\nuproar, amid which the State House and the Common and the Old South\r\nChurch and State Street itself seem anachronisms and untimely\r\nsurvivals of other and holier days.\r\n\r\nIn the old Worcester--and, for aught I know, in the new--far up on\r\nElm Street as it climbs the hill and pushes toward the open country,\r\nstood Governor Lincoln's house--square, white, well back from the\r\nstreet; a fence enclosing the broad lawn, steps and an arched iron\r\ngateway in the centre.  To me ever memorable because there I first\r\nsaw Daniel Webster.  He had come to Worcester campaigning for Taylor,\r\nwhose nomination for the Presidency, over his own head, he had at\r\nfirst declared \"unfit to be made.\"  He arrived in the dusk of\r\nevening, and drove in Governor Lincoln's open landau to the house.  A\r\nmultitude waiting to greet him filled the street.  Webster descended\r\nfrom the carriage, went up the three steps from the sidewalk to the\r\ngateway, {5} turned, and faced the cheering crowd.  The rays from the\r\nlighted lantern in the centre of the arch fell full on his face.  I\r\ndo not remember whether I thought then, but I have often thought\r\nsince of what Emerson said:\r\n\r\n\"If Webster were revealed to me on a dark night by a flash of\r\nlightning, I should be at a loss to know whether an angel or a demon\r\nstood before me.\"\r\n\r\nThat night, at any rate, there was a touch of the demon.  His\r\nadvocacy of the successful soldier was an act of renunciation.  The\r\nleadership of the Whig party belonged to him and not to Zachary\r\nTaylor; or if not to Webster, it belonged to Henry Clay.  He had not\r\nforgiven his successful soldier-rival.  He never forgave him.  Nor\r\ncould he all at once put to sleep for another four years his\r\nhonourable ambition.  His eyes blazed with a fire not all celestial.\r\nThe grave aspect of the man and grave courtesy of his greeting to the\r\npeople before him only half hid the resentment which fed their inward\r\nfire.  But he stood a pillar of state--\r\n\r\n  ... deep on his front engraven\r\n  Deliberation sat and public care.\r\n\r\n\r\nA colossal figure.  We boys in Massachusetts were all brought up to\r\nworship Webster, and worship him we did; till the Fall came, and the\r\nseventh of March speech turned reverence into righteous wrath.\r\n\r\n{6}\r\n\r\nThere was a certain likeness in feature between Mr. Webster and Mr.\r\nGladstone.  The eyes in both were dark, deep set, and wide apart,\r\nbeneath heavily overhanging brows.  In both the flame was volcanic.\r\nThe features in both were chiselled strongly, the lines clear cut,\r\nthe contour of the face and the air of command much the same in the\r\ngreat American and the great Englishman; but Mr. Gladstone had,\r\nbefore the political disasters of his later years had angered him, a\r\nbenignity which Webster lacked.  In stature, in massiveness of frame,\r\nin presence, in that power which springs from repose and from the\r\nforces of reserve, there was no comparison.  Webster had all this,\r\nand Gladstone had not.  I have before me as I write a private\r\nphotograph of Mr. Gladstone, from the camera of a lady who had\r\nsomething more than technical skill, who had a sympathetic insight\r\ninto character and an art-sense.  Among the hundreds of photographs\r\nof the Tory-Liberal, the Protectionist-Free Trader, the\r\nImperialist-Home Ruler, this is the finest and truest I have seen.\r\nBut it is one which brings out his unlikeness to Webster far more\r\nclearly than those resemblances I have noted.  If those resemblances\r\nhave not before been remarked, there are, I imagine, few men living\r\nwho have seen both men in the full splendour of their heroic mould.\r\n\r\nThe records of those later days are full not only of admiring\r\nfriendship for Webster, but also of that bitterness which his\r\napostasy--for so we thought it--begot.  Even friends turned against\r\n{7} him after his support of the Fugitive Slave Law.  As for his\r\nenemies, there was no limit to their language.  A single unpublished\r\nincident will show what the feeling was.  At a meeting of the\r\nAbolitionists in the Boston Melodeon, Charles Lenox Remond, a negro,\r\nin the course of a diatribe against the white race, called Washington\r\na scoundrel.  Wendell Phillips, who was on the platform, intervened:\r\n\r\n\"No, Charles, don't say that.  Don't call Washington a scoundrel.\r\nThe great Virginian held slaves, but he was a great Virginian still,\r\nand a great American.  It is not a fit word to use.  It is not\r\ndescriptive.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, if you call Washington a scoundrel, how are you going to\r\ndescribe Webster?\"\r\n\r\nBesides, again, the Fugitive Slave Law wrought the redemption of\r\nMassachusetts; and we owe that redemption to Webster, indirectly.  It\r\nwas the rendition of Anthony Burns, in 1854, two years after\r\nWebster's death, which completed the conversion of the Bay State from\r\nthe pro-slavery to the anti-slavery faith.  But what I can tell of\r\nthe unwritten history of those black days must be for another time.\r\n\r\nWhatever Webster's faults, and whatever resentment he aroused in\r\n1850, he remained, and will long remain, the foremost citizen of\r\nMassachusetts in that generation.  Go to his opponents if you want\r\ntestimony for that.  Ask Wendell Phillips, and he answers in one of\r\nhis finest sentences, pouring scorn on the men who took up, {8} so\r\nlate as 1861, Webster's mission to crush anti-slavery agitation:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was Webster who announced from the steps of the Revere House\r\n    that he would put down this agitation.  The great statesman,\r\n    discredited and defeated, sleeps at Marshfield by the solemn\r\n    waves of the Atlantic.  _Contempsi Catiline gladios; non tuos\r\n    pertimescam_.  The half-omnipotence of Webster we defied; who\r\n    heeds this pedlar's empty speech?\r\n\r\n\r\nAsk Theodore Parker, who delivered in the Music Hall of Boston a\r\ndiscourse on Webster's death; half-invective, more than\r\nhalf-panegyric, whether he would or no.  It was, I think, Parker who\r\nsaid of him that four American masterpieces in four different kinds\r\nwere Webster's.  The ablest argument ever heard in the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, that in the Dartmouth College case, was his.\r\nHis was the noblest platform speech of his time at the dedication of\r\nBunker Hill Monument.  His the most persuasive address to an American\r\njury, in the White murder case at Salem, with its tremendous epigram,\r\n\"There is no refuge from confession but suicide; and suicide is\r\nconfession.\"  His, finally, the profoundest exposition of\r\nconstitutional law, the reply to Hayne in the United States Senate.\r\nAll these were Webster's, and to Webster alone could any such tribute\r\nbe paid.\r\n\r\nWhen I heard Webster in Faneuil Hall, where he was perhaps at his\r\nbest and most at home, it seemed to me it mattered little what he\r\nsaid.  {9} The authority of the man was what told.  Before he had\r\nuttered a word he had possession of the minds of the three thousand\r\npeople who stood--for we were all standing--waiting for the words we\r\nknew would be words of wisdom.\r\n\r\nTwice I have seen a similar effect by very different artists.  Once\r\nby Rachel at the Boston Theatre, as Camille in Corneille's _Horace_,\r\nwhen the mere apparition of that white-robed figure and the first\r\nrays from those deep-burning eyes laid a spell on the audience.  Not\r\nonce, but many times, by Aimée Declée, at the Princess's Theatre in\r\nLondon and at the Gymnase in Paris.  Of her I shall have something to\r\nsay by and by, but I name her now because she had that rarest of\r\ngifts, the power of gathering an audience into her two small hands\r\nwhile still, silent and motionless; and thereafter never letting them\r\ngo.  In her it was perhaps a magnetic force of emotion, for she was\r\nthe greatest of emotional actresses.  In Webster it was the\r\ndomination of an irresistible personality, with an unmatched\r\nintellectual supremacy, and the prestige of an unequalled career.\r\n\r\nWhatever it was, we all bowed to it.  We were there to take orders\r\nfrom him, to think his thoughts, to do as he would have us.  He might\r\nhave talked nonsense.  We should not have thought it was nonsense.\r\nHe might have reversed his policy.  We should have held him\r\nconsistent.  We should have followed him, believing the road was the\r\nsame we had always travelled together.  He was still the man whom\r\nMassachusetts delighted to {10} honour.  The forces of the whole\r\nState were at his disposal, as they had been for thirty years.\r\n\r\nHe stood upon the platform an august, a majestic figure, from which\r\nthe blue coat and buff trousers and the glitter of gilt buttons did\r\nnot detract.  Once, and only once, have I found myself under the sway\r\nof an individuality more masterful than Webster's, much later in\r\nlife, so that the test was more decisive; but it was not Mr.\r\nGladstone's.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{11}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS PURITANISM--THE YALE CLASS OF 1853\r\n\r\nMassachusetts was in those days, that is, in the middle of the last\r\ncentury, in the bonds of that inherited and unrelaxing Puritanism\r\nwhich was her strength and her weakness.  Darwin had not spoken.  The\r\neffort to reconcile science and theology--not religion--had only\r\nbegun.  Agassiz's was still the voice most trusted, and he, with all\r\nhis scientific genius and knowledge, was on the side of the angels.\r\nThe demand for evidence had not yet overcome the assertion of\r\necclesiastical authority in matters of belief.  The spiritual\r\nascendancy of the New England minister was little, if at all,\r\nimpaired, and his political ascendancy had still to be reckoned with.\r\nThere were, I suppose, no two places in the world so much under the\r\ndominion of one form or another of priestly rule as the six New\r\nEngland States and Scotland; and therefore no two between which\r\nspiritual and political resemblances were so close.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, influences which while less visible were\r\nsometimes more potent.  The pastor was the figurehead of a\r\nCongregational Church; or, to use Phillips's simile, he was the {12}\r\nwalking-beam which the observer might think the propelling force of\r\nthe steamboat.  \"But,\" said Phillips, \"there's always a fanatic down\r\nin the hold, feeding the fires.\"  The fanatics were the deacons.\r\nThey often had in them the spirit of persecution.  They encroached\r\nupon, and sometimes usurped, the rightful authority of the true head\r\nof the Church, the pastor, in matters of faith and matters of conduct\r\nalike.  They constituted themselves the guardians of the morals of\r\nthe flock, the pastor and his family included.  My father was a man\r\nwhose mind ran strongly toward Liberalism.  He had nothing of the\r\ninquisitor about him.  But his deacons were possessed with a\r\nschool-mastering demon.  They had the vigilance of the detective\r\npoliceman and a deep sense of responsibility to their Creator for the\r\nbehaviour of their fellow-men.  Good and conscientious citizens all\r\nof them, but indisposed to believe that men who held other opinions\r\nthan theirs might also be good.  Their individual consciences were to\r\nbe the guide of life to the rest of the world.  If they had not the\r\nferocity of Mucklewraith they had his intolerance.  They would have\r\nmade absence from divine service a statutory offence, as the earlier\r\nPuritans did.  Two services each Sunday, a Sunday-school in between,\r\nand prayer-meetings on Wednesdays--all these must be punctually\r\nattended by us children, and were.\r\n\r\nWhen a decision had to be taken about my going to college, I wished\r\nto be sent to Harvard, {13} as every Massachusetts boy naturally\r\nwould.  But Harvard was a Unitarian college, and the deacons\r\npersuaded my father that the welfare of my immortal soul would be\r\nimperilled if I was taught Greek and Latin by professors who did not\r\nbelieve in a Trinitarian God.  This spirit of theological\r\npartisanship prevailed and I was sent to Yale.  At that admirable\r\nseat of learning there was no danger of laxity or heresy.  The\r\nstrictest Presbyterianism was taught relentlessly and the strictest\r\ndiscipline enforced.  Chapel morning and evening, three or perhaps\r\nfour services on Sunday--in all let us say some eighteen separate\r\ncompulsory attendances on religious exercises each week.  Would it be\r\nwonderful if a boy who had undergone all this for four years should\r\nconsider that he had earned the right to relaxation in after days?\r\n\r\nNone the less willingly do I acknowledge my debt to Yale, a debt\r\nwhich would have been heavier had I been more industrious.  The\r\nPresident of the University in our time was the Reverend Dr.\r\nWolseley--learned, austere, kindly, but remote.  We boys saw little\r\nof him except on a pedestal or in the pulpit.  When he bade the class\r\nfarewell, he made us a friendly little speech and proposed a toast:\r\n\"The Class of 1853.  I drink their healths in water.  May their names\r\nnot be writ in water.\"  Nor were they.  Perhaps no class contained so\r\nmany members who have filled larger spaces for a longer time in the\r\npublic eye and the public press.\r\n\r\n{14}\r\n\r\nThere was Stedman, the poet and poet critic.  He left poems which\r\nwill live forever, but no such body of poetical achievement as he\r\nmight have produced had not circumstances obliged him to devote to\r\nbusiness and to editorial work abilities superior to either.  He is\r\nnot remembered pre-eminently as a poet of patriotism, but the only\r\npoem of Stedman's included in Emerson's Parnassus is his \"John Brown\r\nof Osawatomie,\" written--was it not for _The Tribune_?--in November,\r\n1859, while Brown lay in his Virginian jail waiting to be hanged.\r\nStedman, his genius flowering in a prophetic insight, warned them;\r\nbut his \"Virginians, don't do it\" rang unavailingly through the land;\r\nand his\r\n\r\n        ...Old Brown,\r\n        Osawatomie Brown,\r\n  May trouble you more than ever when you've nailed\r\n            his coffin down\r\n\r\nnever reached the Virginian mind till Northern regiments sang their\r\nway through Southern States to the tune of \"John Brown's Body.\"\r\nStedman's range was wide.  He set perhaps most value on his _Lyrics\r\nand Idylls_.  That was the title he gave to the volume of poems\r\npublished in London in 1879; selected by himself for his English\r\nreaders.  His American friends will like to be reminded that the\r\nfirst third of the volume is given to \"American Lyrics and Idylls,\"\r\nincluding \"Old Brown,\" and that tender monody on Horace {15} Greeley\r\nwhich no _Tribune_ reader can have forgotten.\r\n\r\nThere was Charlton Lewis, an Admirable Crichton in his\r\nversatility,--if the serious meaning of that name has survived Mr.\r\nBarrie's travesty of it on the stage.  We knew him at Yale as a\r\nmathematician who played with the toughest problems proposed to us by\r\nmathematical tutors and professors; whose very names I forget.  We\r\nknew him afterward as lawyer, insurance expert, Latin lexicographer,\r\njournalist, financier, and editor of _Harper's Book of Facts_, the\r\nbest of all books of facts; but now, or when I last inquired, out of\r\nprint and not easily procurable.  He understood cards also.  Playing\r\nwhist, which I think was forbidden in college, he dealt to his\r\npartner and two adversaries the usual miscellaneous hand; and to\r\nhimself, by way of jest, all thirteen trumps.  When the enemy\r\nremonstrated Lewis answered: \"If you will specify any other order in\r\nwhich it is mathematically more probable that the hands would be\r\ndistributed, I will admit that this is not the product of chance.\"\r\nAn answer to which there was no answer.  He delighted in puzzling\r\nminds less acute and less scientific than his own.  Few men have had\r\na more serviceable brain than his, or known better how to use it; and\r\nhis power of work knew no limit.\r\n\r\nThere was Mr. Justice Shiras of the United States Supreme Court.\r\nThere was Fred Davies, a dignitary of the Church--in whom\r\nprofessional decorum never extinguished a natural sense of {16} fun\r\nand good-fellowship.  There was, and happily still is, Andrew White,\r\nhistorian, writer of books, President of Cornell University,\r\nAmbassador, and, in a forgetful moment, one of President Cleveland's\r\ncommission to determine the boundary line between a British colony\r\nand a foreign state; neither of whom had asked him to draw it.  There\r\nwas Isaac Bromley, one of the world's jesters who make life amusing\r\nto everybody but themselves; whom all his colleagues on _The Tribune_\r\nvalued for qualities which were his own and not ours.  Not the least\r\nof the many eulogies which death brought him was the testimony of\r\nthose who knew him best, that his humour was good-humoured.\r\n\r\nThe most casual reader must have noticed how various are the talents\r\nand characters among the hundred and six graduates of 1853.  There\r\nare many more.  There is Wayne MacVeagh, the most delightful of\r\ncompanions, counsel in great causes all his life, Attorney-General of\r\nthe United States, Ambassador to Rome, one of the men who paid least\r\nrespect to social conventionalities, yet in Washington a central\r\nfigure in society.  But neither law nor society gave full scope for\r\nthe restless energy of his mind.  During all the later years I have\r\nknown MacVeagh he has been a thinker, serious, daring, too often\r\nunsound.  His reading has been largely among books dealing with those\r\nnew social problems which vex the minds of men, often needlessly, and\r\ndisturb clear brains.  Novelties interested him; and the drift of his\r\nthoughts was toward radical reconstruction {17} and toward one form\r\nor another of socialism.  He espoused new opinions with vehemence;\r\nand sometimes reverted with vehemence to the old.  We met again in\r\nLondon some five and twenty years ago.  MacVeagh delivered to a\r\nlittle company at lunch a brief but reasoned and rather passionate\r\ndiscourse against our diplomatic service in Europe.  When I suggested\r\nthat we had none, he retorted:\r\n\r\n\"But we have Ministers and Legations and though some of our Ministers\r\nare good and able men, they are wasted.  No Minister is needed.  All\r\nthe business of the United States in Europe could be done and ought\r\nto be done by Consuls, and all the Legations ought to be abolished,\r\nand the Ministers recalled.\"\r\n\r\nI forget just how long it was after this outburst that MacVeagh was\r\nappointed Minister to Constantinople; and accepted and served; with\r\ncredit and distinction, and afterward more efficiently still as\r\nAmbassador to Rome.\r\n\r\nHe had a pretty wit in conversation, and a power of repartee before\r\nwhich many an antagonist went down.  A celebrated American _causeur_\r\nonce attacked him as a Democrat.  \"Yes,\" answered MacVeagh, \"I am a\r\nDemocrat and know it.  You are a Democrat and don't know it.  You\r\nhave just been made President of a great railroad corporation.  The\r\nstock sells to-day at a hundred and twenty; but before you have been\r\nPresident three years, you will have brought it within reach of the\r\nhumblest citizen.\"\r\n\r\n{18}\r\n\r\nAn unfulfilled prophecy, but that is what makes prophecy so useful as\r\nan instrument of debate.  Only time can prove it false.\r\n\r\nThese men and many more gave distinction to the class.  Randall\r\nGibson, of Louisiana, afterward Confederate General and United States\r\nSenator, cannot be omitted from the briefest catalogue.  He was one\r\nof a small band of Southerners at Yale.  When you came to know him\r\nyou understood what the South means by the word gentleman; and by its\r\napplication of the title to the best of its own people, or to the\r\nruling class in the South as a whole.  Already, of course, and even\r\nin this younger brood, the clash of interests and sentiments, the\r\n\"prologue to the omen coming on,\" the strained relations between\r\nSouth and North, were visible, and vexatious enough in social\r\nintercourse.  Randall Gibson was saturated with Southern ideas, and\r\nperhaps had the prejudices of his race, but he kept them to himself\r\nor did not impart them to us of the North.  He lived in the upper\r\nair, yet he looked down on nobody.  There was no more popular man,\r\nyet no man who held himself so completely aloof from the\r\nfamiliarities common enough as between classmates.\r\n\r\nIn after life, from the havoc of war and other causes, he suffered\r\nmuch and bore disaster with courage.  He was a man with reference to\r\nwhom it is possible, and was always possible, to use the much-abused\r\nword chivalrous, with the certainty it could not be misunderstood.\r\nWhen he died {19} there passed away a beautiful example of a type\r\ncommon in literature, rare in life, rarest of all in this generation,\r\nthe grand seigneur.\r\n\r\nThere was lately an Englishman, Earl Spencer, whom Randall Gibson\r\nresembled: slightly in appearance, closely in those essential traits\r\nwhich go to the making of character.  The same urbanity; the same\r\nconsiderateness to others; the same loyalty of nature; the same\r\nshining courage; the same unfailing effort to conform to high ideals.\r\nBoth men had the pride of race and of descent.  In both it turned to\r\nfine effects.  I have known Lord Spencer to submit--I may be forgiven\r\nthis distant allusion--to what can only be called an extortion rather\r\nthan engage in a legal controversy he thought undignified, yet out of\r\nwhich he would have come victorious.  I have known Randall Gibson to\r\naccept the verdict of fate, the award of undeserved adversity, rather\r\nthan defend himself when his success might have exposed his comrades\r\nto censure.  The world may call it in both of them quixotic, but the\r\nworld would be a much better place to live in if quixotry of this\r\nsort were commoner than it is.  Neither of these two men railed\r\nagainst the world, or complained of its ethical standard.  All they\r\ndid was to have each a standard of his own and to govern their own\r\nlives accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{20}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nYALE PROFESSORS--HARVARD LAW SCHOOL\r\n\r\nThe three Yale professors whose names after all these years stand out\r\nmost clearly to me are Thacher, Hadley, and Porter.  Professor\r\nThacher taught Latin.  They used to say he knew Tacitus by\r\nheart--perhaps only a boyish emphasis upon his knowledge of the\r\nlanguage and literature.  He was, at any rate, a good Latinist, and a\r\ngood teacher.  What was perhaps more rare, he was a genial companion,\r\nto whom the distance between professor and pupil was not impassable.\r\nHe won our sympathies because he gave us his; and our admiration, and\r\nalmost our affection, went with our sympathies.  He was one of the\r\nfew college dignitaries upon whom the student feels himself\r\nprivileged to look back as a friend; for on his side the spirit of\r\nfriendly kindness governed the relations between us.\r\n\r\nOf Professor Hadley's Hellenism we expressed our admiration by saying\r\nhe dreamed in Greek.  To us, so long as we were in his hands, Greek\r\nwas the language of the gods.  The modern heresies touching the place\r\nof Greek in a liberal education had at that time not been heard of,\r\nor had taken no hold upon the minds of either teacher or pupil.  {21}\r\nWe learnt Greek, so far as we learnt it, in the same unquestioning\r\nspirit as we read the Bible; so far as we read it.  Hadley taught us\r\nsomething more than grammar and prosody.  He taught us to look at the\r\nworld through Greek eyes and to think Greek thoughts.  To him the\r\nGreek language and literature were not dead but alive, and he sought\r\nto make them live again in his pupils.  I don't say that he always\r\nsucceeded; or often, but at least we perceived his aim, and we\r\nlistened with delight to the roll of Homer's hexameters from his\r\nflexible lips.  For the time being he was a Greek.  To this illusion\r\nhis dark eyes and olive skin and the soft full tones of his voice\r\ncontributed.  Some of his enthusiasms, if not much of his learning,\r\nimparted themselves to us.  If we presently forgot what we learned,\r\nthe influence remained.  \"I do not ask,\" said Sainte-Beuve, \"that a\r\nman shall know Latin or Greek.  All I ask is that he shall have known\r\nit.\"  A sentence in which there is a whole philosophy of education; a\r\nphilosophy which the universities that have abolished Greek out of\r\ntheir compulsory courses forgot to take into account.\r\n\r\nProfessor Porter's mission was to implant in our young minds some\r\nconception of Moral Philosophy and of Rhetoric.  He taught\r\npersuasively, sometimes eloquently, and always with a clearness of\r\nthought and purpose which made him intelligible to the dullest and\r\ninstructive.  He had another means of appeal to his students.  He was\r\nhuman and sympathetic.  We looked {22} upon our professors as, for\r\nthe most part, beings far removed from us; exalted by their position\r\nand virtues above us, and above mankind in general; a sort of\r\ndemigods who had descended to earth for the good of its inhabitants,\r\nto whom, however, they were not of kin.  We never thought that of\r\nProfessor Porter.  He had a magical smile; it was the magic of\r\nkindness.  We fancied that the Faculty dealt with the students in a\r\nspirit of strict justice; from their point of view if not always from\r\nours.  They were a High Court of Justice which laid down the law and\r\nenforced penalties out of proportion to the offence.  It was law, and\r\nthe administration of it was inexorable.  Not so Porter.  He was\r\nnever a hanging judge.  I know it because I owed to him the privilege\r\nof remaining at Yale to the end of my four years.  I have quite\r\nforgotten what crime I committed, but it was one for which, according\r\nto the strict code by which the undergraduates were governed,\r\nexpulsion was the proper sentence; or perhaps only suspension, which\r\nin my case would have meant the same thing.  But Professor Porter\r\nintervened.  There were mitigating circumstances.  These he pressed\r\nupon his colleagues, and I believe he even made himself answerable\r\nfor my good behaviour thereafter.  I stayed on, and if I did not\r\nprofit as I ought to have profited by the opportunity I owed to him,\r\nI was at least grateful to him, and still am.\r\n\r\nProfessor Porter became later President of Yale: one on the roll of\r\nChief Magistrates of the {23} University to whom not Yale only but\r\nthe country is, and for two hundred years has been, indebted.  He\r\nruled wisely, fine administrative qualities reinforcing his scholarly\r\ndistinction.  He was beloved, and his name is for ever a part of the\r\nhistory of this great college.\r\n\r\nLooking back on those days and on the Professors I have known since,\r\nat Yale, Harvard, Columbia, and one or two other American\r\nuniversities, one thing impresses me beyond all others.  It is the\r\nspirit of devotion in those men; of devotion to learning, to letters,\r\nto their colleges, and to their country.  Many of them were, and many\r\nin these days are, men who had before them other and far more\r\nprofitable careers.  They might have won much wider fame and made a\r\ngreat deal more money.  They have been content with the appreciation\r\nof their own world, and with salaries which, I believe, never exceed\r\nsix thousand dollars, and are commonly much less.  When English\r\ncritics, albeit in a friendly spirit, have commented--in private, not\r\nin public--on the American love of money-making, I have made this\r\nanswer, pointing to the absolute unselfishness of one of the highest\r\ntypes of American citizen, all over the land, and to their conception\r\nof what is best in American life.  I have always added that though\r\nothers may speak of their renunciation as a sacrifice, they never do.\r\nSo far as I know them, they are content and more than content; they\r\nrejoice in their work and in the modest circumstances which alone\r\ntheir income permits.  {24} Now and then we hear of some brilliant\r\nscholar as having refused a lucrative post in order to go on teaching\r\nand studying.  There are many more whom we never hear of publicly, to\r\nall of whom the country owes a debt of gratitude if nothing else,\r\nwhich it does not always pay.  But here in England if you state the\r\nfacts you will find them accepted, and welcomed as the best answer to\r\nthe reproach of money-ambitions--a reproach based on conspicuous\r\nexceptions to the general American rule of thrift and simplicity.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating at Yale, and after a year in Mr. Hoar's office at\r\nWorcester, I went to the Harvard Law School.  Harvard was as much a\r\nUnitarian university as ever, but perhaps it was considered that law\r\nwas a safeguard against loose theology, or perhaps the old reasons\r\nwere no longer omnipotent.  I attempt no comparisons between Yale and\r\nHarvard.  There is no kind of likeness between undergraduate and\r\npost-graduate life.  During four years at Yale the discipline had\r\nbeen rigid.  At the Law School in Cambridge I cannot remember that we\r\nwere under any restraint whatever.  In New Haven we lived either in\r\nthe college dormitories or in houses approved by the Faculty; and I\r\nam not sure that in my time we did not all sleep within the college\r\nlimits, insanitary and uncomfortable as many of the buildings then\r\nwere.  But the law student in Cambridge lived where he would and as\r\nhe would.  He went to chapel or not, week-days and Sundays alike, to\r\nsuit himself.  {25} Not even attendance at the law lectures was\r\ncompulsory.  It seems to have been held that students had come to the\r\nschool upon serious business, and that their own interest and the\r\nsuccess of their future careers would be enough to ensure their\r\npresence.  It was not always so.  The very freedom which ought to\r\nhave put men on their honour sometimes became a temptation.  And\r\nBoston was a temptation; as it was, and must always be, to\r\nundergraduates and graduates alike.\r\n\r\nThe years were drawing on--it was now 1854--and the sectional\r\nantagonism of which there had been evidence enough at Yale was\r\nincreasing.  We were older, and the crisis was nearer.  There was a\r\nkind of Law School Parliament in which all things were put to the\r\nissue of debate, and the air often grew hot.  Angry words were\r\nexchanged between Southerners and Northerners.  The rooted belief of\r\nthe Southerner, or of many Southerners, that they had a monopoly of\r\ncourage, was sometimes expressed.  More than once challenges were\r\ntalked of, though I believe none was actually sent.  There was a\r\ncholeric young gentleman from Missouri who put himself forward as\r\nchampion of slavery, and there was an attempt to deny to us of the\r\nNorth the right to express our opinions on our own soil, which did\r\nnot succeed.  The Missourian was the exception.  Of the Southerners\r\nin general at Harvard I should say what I have said of those at Yale:\r\nif they felt themselves of a superior race they accepted the\r\nobligations of superiority, and treated their {26} inferiors with an\r\namiable condescension for which we were not always grateful.\r\n\r\nThese were not matters of which the authorities of Dane Law School\r\ntook notice.  Their business was to teach Law.  Judge Parker was a\r\nreal lawyer, who afterwards revised the General Statutes of\r\nMassachusetts into something like coherence and the symmetry of a\r\nCode.  He handled the law in a scientific spirit, without emphasis,\r\nnot without dry humour, and had ever a luminous method of exposition\r\nwhich grew more luminous as the subjects grew more abstruse.  His\r\ncolleague, Mr. Theophilus Parsons, was, I think, what is called a\r\ncase lawyer, to whom the _chose jugée_ was as sacred as it was more\r\nrecently to the anti-Dreyfusards.  There are always, and I suppose\r\nalways will be, lawyers to whom decisions are more than principles.\r\nParsons was one of these, while Parker's aim was to present to the\r\nstudent the entire body of law as a homogeneous whole, organic,\r\ncapable of abstract treatment, capable of being set forth in the dry\r\nlight of reason.  Whether it was the difference in the men or in\r\ntheir methods I know not, but there can be no doubt that Judge\r\nParker's lectures were better attended and more devoutly listened to\r\nby the students, and that his system bore fruit.  For it created a\r\nhabit of mind, and under his teaching a legal mind was formed, and\r\nbecame a better instrument for use at the Bar.\r\n\r\nThe Bar of Massachusetts was at that time in a period of splendour,\r\nas it had been for generations.  {27} Webster was gone, and there was\r\nno second Webster; he was the leader not only of the Massachusetts\r\nBar but of the American Bar.  But Rufus Choate was still in his\r\nprime, whose eccentricities of manner and of speech could not\r\ndisguise forensic abilities of almost the first order.  Sydney\r\nBartlett, his rival, was as sound as Choate was showy.  But Choate\r\nalso was sound, though he had a spirit of adventure which carried him\r\ntoo far, and a rhetoric not seldom flamboyant.  Some of his phrases\r\nare historical, as of a witness who sought to palliate his dishonesty\r\nby declaring that he never disclosed his iniquitous scheme.  \"A\r\nsoliloquy of fraud,\" retorted Choate.  I heard one of his brethren at\r\nthe Bar say to him as he came into court: \"I suppose you will give us\r\na great sensation to-day, Mr. Choate.\"  \"No,\" answered Choate, \"it is\r\ntoo great a case for sensation.\"  And he tried it all day with\r\nsedateness.  Chief Justice Shaw disliked him, or disliked his\r\nmethods, and sometimes showed his dislike, overruling him rather\r\nroughly.  The great judge was not an Apollo, and there came a day\r\nwhen Mr. Choate, smarting under judicial censure, remarked in an\r\naudible aside to his associate counsel: \"The Chief Justice suggests\r\nto me an Indian idol.  We feel that he is great and we see that he is\r\nugly.\"  But amenities like that were unusual.\r\n\r\nGeneral Butler, afterward too famous at New Orleans and Fort Fisher,\r\nyet after that the Democratic Governor of Whig Massachusetts, had a\r\nnone too savoury renown at the Bar.  Yet it was {28} said of him by\r\nan opponent: \"If you try your case fairly, Butler will try his side\r\nof it fairly; but if you play tricks he can play more tricks than you\r\ncan.\"  His sense of humour was his own, sometimes effective and\r\nsometimes not.  Defending a railway against an action by a farmer\r\nwhose waggon had been run over by a train, and who alleged that the\r\nlook-out sign was not, as required by law, in letters five inches\r\nlong, Butler made him admit he had not looked at the sign.  \"Then,\"\r\nsaid Butler to the jury, \"it could not have availed had the sign been\r\nin letters of living light--five inches long.\"\r\n\r\nThe best contrast to Butler was Richard H. Dana, as good a lawyer, or\r\nbetter, and with the best traditions of a high-minded Bar, pursued in\r\nthe best spirit.  But I will leave Dana till I come to the Burns case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{29}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n  HOW MASSACHUSETTS IN 1854 SURRENDERED THE\r\n  FUGITIVE SLAVE ANTHONY BURNS\r\n\r\nIt was in May, 1854, that Anthony Burns of Virginia was arrested in\r\nBoston as a fugitive slave and brought before Judge Loring, United\r\nStates Commissioner under the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850.  I am not\r\ngoing to re-tell the familiar story of his so-called trial and of the\r\nsurrender of Burns to Colonel Suttle, also of Virginia.  The actual\r\nmilitary rank held by Suttle I do not know, but I call him Colonel on\r\ngeneral principles; or on the principle announced by the late Max\r\nO'Rell in his book on America; with its population of sixty millions;\r\n\"_la plupart des colonels_.\"  But I will tell what I saw; and what\r\nsort of impression the event made at the time upon an eye-witness who\r\nbelonged to the dominant and most conservative party in the State;\r\nthe Whig party.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Burns made a stir in the old Commonwealth comparable to\r\nnone other which had occurred down to that time.  From Worcester,\r\nwhere I was then reading more or less law with Mr. Hoar, I went to\r\nBoston to look on at these proceedings.  I went from no particular\r\nfeeling of sympathy with Burns, nor yet mainly from {30} abhorrence\r\nof that subservience to slaveholders in which, until after Webster's\r\nSeventh of March speech in 1850, Massachusetts had been steeped.  I\r\nwent from curiosity.  I wanted to see how the legal side of it was\r\nmanaged.  For though the popular dislike of such proceedings, which\r\nneither the Shadrach nor the Sims case had fully roused, was then\r\nslumbering, the State had, so long ago as 1843, passed a law\r\nforbidding any judge or other officer holding a commission from the\r\nState to take any part in the rendition of any person claimed as a\r\nfugitive slave under the old Act of Congress of 1793.  Yet here was a\r\nMassachusetts Judge of Probate sitting as United States Commissioner\r\nand doing the work which in the South itself was done by bloodhounds,\r\nand by the basest of mankind.  I thought I should like to see how\r\nsuch a man looked while engaged upon that task; the more so as he\r\nbore a good Massachusetts name; and what kind of a trial a fugitive\r\nslave was to have on Massachusetts soil.\r\n\r\nBurns was seized on a Wednesday evening, May 24th.  He appeared\r\nbefore Judge Loring at nine o'clock Thursday morning, handcuffed,\r\nbetween two policemen.  It was obviously intended that the \"trial\"\r\nshould begin and end that same morning.  Burns had been allowed to\r\nsee nobody.  He had no counsel.  When Robert Morris, a coloured\r\nlawyer, tried to speak to him the policemen drove him away.  By\r\nchance, Mr. Richard H. Dana, Jr., and another lawyer of repute, {31}\r\nMr. C. M. Ellis, heard of what was going on, and went to the\r\ncourt-room.  Dana intervened, not as counsel, for he had no standing\r\nas counsel, but as _amicus curiæ_, and asked that the hearing be\r\npostponed and that Burns be allowed to consult friends and counsel.\r\nThe black man sat there \"stupefied and terrified,\" as Dana said,\r\nincapable of thought or action.  After repeated protests by Dana and\r\nEllis, Judge Loring put off the hearing till Saturday.  But Burns was\r\nstill kept in secret confinement.  When Wendell Phillips asked to see\r\nhim to arrange that he should have counsel, the United States Marshal\r\nrefused.  Phillips went to Cambridge to see Judge Loring, and Judge\r\nLoring gave him an order of admission to the cell.  But he said to\r\nPhillips--this Judge-Commissioner said of the cause he was about to\r\ntry judicially--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Phillips, the case is so clear that I do not think you will be\r\njustified in placing any obstacle in the way of this man's going\r\nback, _as he probably will!_\"\r\n\r\nA remark without precedent or successor in Massachusetts\r\njurisprudence, which, before and since, has ever borne an honourable\r\nrenown for judicial impartiality.\r\n\r\nWhen I went to the Court House on the Saturday it had become a\r\nfortress.  There were United States Marshals and their deputies,\r\npolice in great numbers, and United States Marines.  The chain had\r\nnot then been hung about the building nor had Chief Justice Shaw yet\r\ncrawled beneath it.  I was allowed to enter the building, and to {32}\r\ngo upstairs to the corridor on the first floor, out of which opened\r\nthe door of the court-room where Burns was being tried, not for his\r\nlife, but for freedom which was more than life.  There I was stopped.\r\nThe police officer at the door would listen to nothing.  The\r\ncourt-room, free by law and by custom to all citizens, was closed by\r\norder, as I understood, not of the Commissioner who was holding his\r\nslave-court, but by the United States Marshal, who was responsible\r\nfor the custody of Burns and alarmed by the state of public opinion.\r\nWhile I argued with the police, there came up a smart young officer\r\nof United States Marines.  He asked what it was all about.  I said I\r\nwas a law student and wished to enter.  \"Admit him,\" said the officer\r\nof United States Marines.  He waited till he saw his order obeyed and\r\nthe police stand aside from the door; then bowed to me and went his\r\nway.  So it happened that it was to an officer of an armed force of\r\nthe United States that I was indebted for the privilege of entering a\r\nMassachusetts court-room while a public trial was going on.\r\n\r\nInside they were taking testimony.  Mr. Dana and Mr. Ellis were now\r\nacting as counsel for Burns, who still seemed \"stupefied and\r\nterrified.\"  The testimony was only interesting because it concerned\r\nthe liberty of a human being.  Judge Loring sat upon the bench with,\r\nat last, an anxious look as if he had begun to realize the storm that\r\nwas raging outside, and the revolt of Massachusetts against this\r\nbusiness of slave-catching {33} by Massachusetts judges.  I spoke for\r\na moment with Mr. Dana and then with one or two of the anti-slavery\r\nleaders who sat listening to the proceedings.  That sealed my fate.\r\nWhen I returned after the adjournment I was again refused admission,\r\nand ordered to leave the Court House.  When I told the Deputy Marshal\r\nI had as much right there as he had and would take no orders from\r\nhim, he threatened me with arrest.  But of this he presently thought\r\nbetter, and finding all protest useless, I went away.\r\n\r\nOf the \"trial,\" therefore, I saw and heard little.  But of the\r\nFaneuil Hall meeting called to protest against the surrender I saw\r\nmuch, though not of the sequel to it in Court Square.  Most of the\r\nAbolitionist leaders were there, but the Abolitionists at that time\r\nwould have been lost in the great spaces of Faneuil Hall.  The three\r\nthousand men who crowded it were the \"solid men of Boston,\" who by\r\nthis time had begun to think they did not care to see a Virginian\r\nslave-holder crack his whip about their ears.  The Puritan temper was\r\nup.  The spirit of Otis and Hancock and Sam Adams burned once more in\r\nthe hearts of living men.  The cheers were incessant; cheers for men\r\nwho a few days before had been almost outcasts--far outside at any\r\nrate, the sacred sphere in which the men of State Street and Beacon\r\nStreet dwelt.  Theodore Parker, who spoke first from a gallery, was\r\ncheered, and Phillips was cheered.  As the evening drew on, it was\r\nevident that violent {34} counsels were likely to prevail.  Already\r\nthere had been, all over the city, talk of a rescue.  Parker, ever\r\nprone to extreme views, was for it, and made a speech for which he\r\nwas indicted but of course never tried.  The indictment was but a\r\npiece of vindictive annoyance.  But evidently nothing had been\r\nprepared, or, if it had been, these leaders had not been taken into\r\nthe confidence of the men who meant real business.\r\n\r\nToward the end some one--name unknown--moved that the meeting adjourn\r\nto the Revere House to groan Suttle.  Parker, who was not chairman,\r\nput the motion and declared it carried, as beyond doubt it was, and\r\nwith wild shouts the vast audience, too closely packed to move\r\nquickly, set their faces to the door and began streaming slowly out.\r\nPhillips, who was against this plan and against any violence not\r\nefficiently organized, came forward on the platform.  The few\r\nsentences he uttered have never, I think, been re ported or printed,\r\nbut I can hear them still.  At the first note of that clarion voice\r\nthe surging throng stopped and turned.  Said Phillips:\r\n\r\n\"Let us remember where we are and what we are going to do.  You have\r\nsaid that you will vindicate the fame of Massachusetts.  Let me tell\r\nyou that you will never do it by going to the Revere House to-night\r\nto attempt the impossible feat of insulting a kidnapper.  The zeal\r\nthat won't keep till to-morrow never will free a slave.\"\r\n\r\nIn that single moment, he had recovered his control of the audience.\r\nThe movement to the {35} doors had stopped.  Every one waited for\r\nwhat was coming.  Phillips was at his best.  He was master of himself\r\nand of those before him.  The words of entreaty were words of\r\ncommand.  He stood and spoke as one having authority.\r\n\r\nBut just then came a voice from the other end of the hall.  It\r\nbelonged to Mr. Charles L. Swift, the vehement young editor of a\r\nweekly paper called _The Commonwealth_, and it announced that a mob\r\nof negroes had attacked the Court House, which had been turned into a\r\ngaol, and wanted help to rescue Burns.  That dissolved the spell.\r\nFaces were again turned to the door.  The shouts which Phillips had\r\nsilenced broke loose once more; and the three thousand citizens of\r\nBoston had become a mob.  It was all to no purpose.  The hall was\r\nlong in emptying itself: and long before those who were really in\r\nearnest could reach the Court House, the ill-advised and ill-planned\r\nattack had been made and failed.  Colonel Higginson, who, I believe,\r\ndevised it and led it, had not at that time any experience in\r\nmeasures of war.  He had plenty of courage of the hot-headed\r\nkind--the kind not then needed.  Perhaps Alcott who, after the rush\r\nhad been made with no success, marched coolly up the steps leading to\r\nthe door defended by armed police and troops, umbrella in hand, was\r\nas much a hero as anybody.  But it was all over, I gathered in a few\r\nminutes, and the only casualty was the death of a Marshal's deputy,\r\nJames Batchelder.  I had got away from Faneuil Hall as soon as I\r\ncould, and the distance {36} to the Court House is short, but I\r\narrived too late to see anything but an empty square and that open\r\ndoorway with a phalanx of defenders inside.\r\n\r\nBurns was not rescued.  He was surrendered, and no man who saw it\r\never forgot that shameful spectacle, nor doubted that it was the\r\nrendition of Anthony Burns which completed the conversion of the Old\r\nBay State from the pro-slavery to the anti-slavery faith.  Webster\r\nhad held the Puritan conscience in chains for a generation.  It\r\nrevolted, no doubt, at the Seventh of March speech; it was stirred by\r\nthe Shadrach and Sims cases; but the final emancipation of the State\r\nfrom its long thraldom to the slave power coincided with the\r\nsurrender of Burns to Suttle.  On that Saturday, men saw for\r\nthemselves, and for the first time, what fugitive slave-hunting in\r\nMassachusetts really meant, and what degree of degradation it brought.\r\n\r\nThe Court House in chains; the Chief Justice stooping to pass beneath\r\nthem; the streets and squares crowded with State Militia, guarding\r\nthe entrance to every street on the route; United States Marines in\r\nhollow square with Burns and the United States Marshals in the\r\ncentre; United States troops preceding and United States artillery\r\nfollowing.  It was fitting that it should be so.  The State and the\r\nUnited States were partners in the crime, equal offenders against the\r\nmoral law, or against the higher law, which till then had been the\r\nheritage of the Puritan {37} Commonwealth, and had sometimes been\r\nheard of even in Washington.  They shared in the guilt and shared in\r\nthe infamy.  Both have since amply atoned for their sin, but nothing,\r\nnot even a Four Years' Civil War for Union and Freedom, not even the\r\nblood of heroes and martyrs, will ever quite wash out from the memory\r\nof those who saw it the humiliations of that day.  It blistered and\r\nburnt and left a scar for ever.  This procession took its course in\r\nbroad daylight down State Street on its way to Long Wharf, where a\r\nUnited States revenue cutter waited to embark the kidnapped\r\nslave--kidnapped by process of law--and his master, Suttle.  The\r\nsteps of the Merchants' Exchange were thronged with Lawrences and\r\nFays and Lorings who had been foremost in trying to crush the\r\nanti-slavery agitation.  But when this column drew near, these\r\nfriends and servants of the slave-owner and of the cotton trade\r\nsuddenly remembered that they were men before they were merchants;\r\nand men of Massachusetts at that.  They broke into groans and cries\r\nof execration, and the troops marched past them to the music of\r\nhisses and curses.  All this I saw and heard.  The re-enslavement of\r\nBurns was the liberation of Massachusetts.  The next time I saw\r\ntroops in the streets of Boston was in April, 1861, when the Sixth\r\nMassachusetts Regiment, answering to the call of President Lincoln,\r\nstarted for Washington via Baltimore, with results known to the world.\r\n\r\n{38}\r\n\r\nOne more incident.  On the Sunday Theodore Parker preached in the\r\nMusic Hall, then the largest hall in Boston, what he called a sermon\r\non these events.  But Parker's sermons were very often like those of\r\nCromwell's colonels; you heard in them the clash of arms, and in this\r\nmore than in most.  He never cared deeply about measuring his words,\r\nand he believed in speaking the truth about men as well as things\r\nwith extreme plainness.  On this Sunday he was in his finest Old\r\nTestament mood; the messenger of the wrath of the Almighty.  He flung\r\nopen his Bible with the gesture of a man who draws a sword, and in\r\ntones that rang like a cry of battle, thundered out his text:\r\n\r\n\"Exodus xx. 15. 'Thou shalt not steal.'\"\r\n\r\nThe text was itself a sermon.  It was the custom in this Music Hall\r\nchurch to applaud when you felt like it, or even to hiss.  A deep\r\nmurmur, which presently swelled into a roar of applause, greeted the\r\ntext.  The face of the preacher was aflame; so were his words as he\r\ntold the story of this awful week and set in the clear light of truth\r\nthe acts and words of the Massachusetts Judge who had brought\r\ndisgrace upon Massachusetts.  When he came to the attack on the Court\r\nHouse, the abortive attempt to rescue Burns, and the death of the\r\nMarshal's deputy killed at his post, he burst out:\r\n\r\n\"Edward Greely Loring, I charge _you_ with the murder of James\r\nBatchelder.  _You_ fired the shot that made his wife a widow and his\r\nchildren {39} orphans.  Yours is the guilt.  The penalty a righteous\r\nGod will exact for that life he will demand from you.\"\r\n\r\nTo say that, he left his pulpit, which was but a desk on the Music\r\nHall platform, stepped a little to one side, and stood full in view\r\nof the great company which had gathered to hear him on this peaceful\r\nSabbath morning; a fair target for another shot had any hearer been\r\nminded to try one.  You think that a fanciful suggestion?  Then you\r\nlittle know the fierceness of the feelings which in those days raged\r\nin Boston.  They presently grew fiercer, and reached a climax in 1860\r\nand the early winter of 1861; when men on both sides for many months\r\nwent armed, and were quite ready to use their arms; and when Phillips\r\nand Garrison were in daily peril of their lives from assassination\r\nand, less frequently but more deadly, from mobs.\r\n\r\nAmong all that devoted band there was no braver soul than Parker's.\r\nHe was by profession and training a scholar, a theologian, a man of\r\nbooks and letters, with a rare knowledge of languages and literature,\r\nand the best collection of German ballads in America; shelves full of\r\nthem in his library at the top of his house.  But by temperament he\r\nwas a fighter; as befitted the grandson of that Captain John Parker\r\nwho commanded the minute men at Lexington, April 19th, 1775.  He\r\nwrote much, preached often and well, and for twenty years was a great\r\nforce in Boston and elsewhere.  A fiery little man, with {40} a ruddy\r\nface and great dome of a head, spectacles over his pale blue eyes,\r\nthe love of God and of his fellow-men in his heart; and by them\r\nbeloved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{41}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN DEFOE, RICHARD HENRY DANA, JR.\r\n\r\nRichard Henry Dana, Jr., to whose intervention in the Burns case we\r\nowe it that Judge Loring was compelled to grant Burns something in\r\nthe nature of a trial, was a man whom Massachusetts may well be\r\ncontent to remember as one of her representatives for all time.  By\r\ndescent, and in himself, he was a chosen son of that chosen people.\r\nHis father, Richard Henry, his grandfather, Francis, his\r\ngreat-grandfather, Richard, were all jurists, all patriots, all men\r\nof letters.  Take one step more, and you come to Daniel, then to\r\nRichard again, who, if not quite a voyager to New England in the\r\n_Mayflower_, is heard of as a resident in Cambridge in 1640.  Six\r\nDanas--nay, five, since our Dana survived his father but three\r\nyears--span two centuries and a half: from father to son as they took\r\ntheir march down these eventful years, an unbroken line, a race of\r\ngentlemen.\r\n\r\nIt used to be made a reproach to the Dana of whom I write that he was\r\na gentleman.  Beyond doubt he deserved the reproach.  When a\r\ncandidate for Congress in 1868 in the Essex district against Ben\r\nButler that eminent warrior called {42} him a kid-gloved aristocrat.\r\n\"Not even gloved has my hand ever touched his,\" answered Dana in the\r\nheat of a redhot campaign.  Butler's rancour lasted to the end, as we\r\nshall see.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, is no biography of Dana.  I am writing of what I saw\r\nand heard; or not much more.  I dealt with the Burns case as a record\r\nof personal impressions.  But let me quote as an example of Dana's\r\nmethod of statement his account of Burns's arrest.  He said to Judge\r\nLoring:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Burns was arrested suddenly, on a false pretence, coming home at\r\n    nightfall from his day's work, and hurried into custody, among\r\n    strange men, in a strange place, and suddenly, whether claimed\r\n    rightfully or claimed wrongfully, he saw he was claimed as a\r\n    slave, and his condition burst upon him in a flood of terror.\r\n    This was at night.  You saw him, sir, the next day, and you\r\n    remember the state he was then in.  You remember his stupefied\r\n    and terrified condition.  You remember his hesitation, his timid\r\n    glance about the room, even when looking in the mild face of\r\n    justice.  How little your kind words reassured him.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat is the same hand which wrote _Two Years Before the Mast_--the\r\ntouch of Defoe, with Defoe's direct simplicity of method and power of\r\ngetting the effect he wanted by the simplest means; the last word in\r\nart, in all arts.  Dana was incapable of rhetorical extravagance or\r\nof insincerity of any kind.  His _Two Years Before the Mast_ is as\r\nmuch a classic in England as at home.  One proof of it is the number\r\nof pirated editions, before there was an international copyright law.\r\nHe wrote to me once: \"I hear there is a cheap English edition of {43}\r\nthe book which has had, because of its cheapness, a great\r\ncirculation.  Published, I think, in Hull.  Could you send me a copy\r\nas a curiosity?\"  I sent it; a little fat volume with a red cloth\r\ncover, much gilt, very closely printed, and sold at a shilling, long\r\nbefore the days of cheap books.  It had sold by scores of thousands.\r\nIt is a book always in print, in one edition or another.  Copyright\r\nprofited Dana no more in America than in England, or not for a long\r\ntime.  Bryant, to whom Dana's father sent the manuscript, hawked it\r\nabout from one publisher to another in vain, till finally he sold it\r\noutright to Harpers for two hundred and fifty dollars, copyright and\r\nall.  In my copy, with the imprint of James R. Osgood & Co., Boston,\r\nis a Preface dated 1869, in which Dana says: \"After twenty-eight\r\nyears the copyright of this book has reverted to me\"; and so he\r\npresents the first \"author's edition\" to the public.  My copy was a\r\ngift from Dana; it is among the treasures I possess and care for\r\nmost, with this inscription in Dana's clear, quiet handwriting:\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dear Smalley,--Will you accept this volume from me and believe\r\n    me ever truly yours,\r\n\r\n    RICH'D H. DANA, JR.\r\n\r\n    _Boston, Feb._ 17, 1876.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy real acquaintance with Dana had begun ten years before, when, in\r\nJune or July, 1866, we crossed the Atlantic together in what was then\r\nthe crack ship of the Cunard line, the _China_, the first {44} screw\r\nthat carried the Cunard flag, capable of fourteen knots.  The\r\nCunarders then sailed from Boston, touched at Halifax, and thence\r\nsteamed to Queenstown direct, and so on to Liverpool.  Halifax was an\r\nexperience; it took us, with all the Cunard seamanship, and there was\r\nnone better, four hours to get alongside the pier, the currents\r\nrunning I know not how many miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe _China_ belonged to the old school; of all new schools the Cunard\r\npeople, now foremost in everything, had at that time an abhorrence.\r\nThe saloon aft and tapering to a point, racks over the table filled\r\nwith table glass, long benches for seats, cabins crowded and dimly\r\nlighted with one smoking and smelling oil lamp in a triangular glass\r\ncase between two cabins; sanitary arrangements unspeakable.  I, on my\r\nfirst Atlantic voyage, thought it all the height of luxury; and so it\r\nwas, for that time.  The modern comforts and splendours of sea life\r\ndate from 1889 with the White Star _Teutonic_, launched in that year,\r\nfirst of the \"floating palaces.\"  The _China_ made her way from\r\nHalifax to Queenstown through a continuous fog at undiminished speed.\r\nThe captain, for an exception among the Cunard captains of those\r\ndays, regarded a passenger as a human being, and not merely as a\r\nparcel to be safely carried from port to port and dumped safely on\r\nthe wharf, intermediate sufferings of no account.  He would answer a\r\nquestion.  I asked him, with the audacity of a novice, whether it was\r\nsafe to steam day and night through a fog at full speed.\r\n\r\n{45}\r\n\r\n\"Safe, good God, no.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why do you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?  I will tell you why.  First, we have got to get to Queenstown\r\nand Liverpool.  Second, fogs don't last for ever, and the faster we\r\ngo the sooner we shall get out of this one.  And third, if there's a\r\ncollision, the vessel going at the greatest speed has the best\r\nchance.\"\r\n\r\nSo antedating by many years the famous saying of another Cunard\r\ncaptain, summoned to the bridge when a collision seemed imminent,\r\nfinding the engines reversed, and instantly ordering \"full speed\r\nahead\"; remarking to the first officer who had reversed the engines:\r\n\"If there's any running down to be done on this voyage, I propose to\r\ndo it.\"  But there was none.\r\n\r\nWhen I told Dana of my talk with the _China's_ captain, that\r\nexperienced seaman and author of _The Seaman's Manual_ observed: \"I\r\nlike a captain to have the courage of his opinions, but not to tell\r\nhis passengers.  Keep it to yourself.\"  And I have kept it for forty\r\nyears; the captain and ship are gone to Davy Jones's locker.  Nothing\r\nhappened, but something very nearly happened.  There had been no\r\nchance of an observation since leaving Halifax, and we made the Irish\r\ncoast rather suddenly, some miles further north than we expected,\r\ncame near enough to hear the breakers, and swung to the south in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nHis mind full of sea lore and of sea romance as well, Dana was the\r\nmost delightful of companions on shipboard.  Beneath an exterior\r\nwhich people {46} thought cold, he had a great kindliness of nature.\r\nHe made no professions; his acts spoke for him.  He gave freely of\r\nthe riches of his mind.  He knew England and the ways of the English,\r\nand was full of illustrative stories; among them was one of his first\r\nvisit to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I heard that night one of the best speeches to which I ever\r\n    listened: fluent, rich in facts, sound in argument; well phrased\r\n    and well delivered.  I said to myself, \"That man must carry the\r\n    House with him.\"  When he sat down a member rose on the opposite\r\n    side and spoke for perhaps ten minutes.  He stumbled along,\r\n    hesitated, grew confused, his sentences without beginning or end;\r\n    nothing but a knowledge of the subject and a great sincerity to\r\n    recommend him.\r\n\r\n    But it was perfectly evident that the first speech had no weight\r\n    with the House, and that the second convinced everybody.  The\r\n    first speaker was Whiteside, a brilliant Irishman and\r\n    Solicitor-General; the second a county member whose name I never\r\n    knew.  The House thought Whiteside merely an advocate and his\r\n    speech forensic.  His opponent was a man whom everybody trusted.\r\n    It was character that carried the day.  And you will find it\r\n    generally does with the English.\r\n\r\n\r\nDana brought to the study of the law a philosophic mind, and to the\r\ntrial of causes in court a power of lucid exposition invaluable alike\r\nwith the Bench and with a jury.  The law was to him a body of\r\nsymmetrical doctrine.  He referred everything to principles, the only\r\nreal foundation for anything.  He stood very high at the Bar, for he\r\nhad learning and would take immense pains, and when he brought a case\r\ninto court it {47} was a work of art.  Moreover, he brought a\r\nconscience with it.  And he was one of the lawyers, none too\r\nnumerous, to whom even Chief Justice Shaw listened.  Out of many\r\nanecdotes I have heard from him I will choose one.\r\n\r\nHe had defended in the United States Circuit Court a man indicted for\r\naiding in the escape of a fugitive slave.  \"The case against him,\"\r\nsaid Dana, \"was perfectly clear; there was really no defence; he had\r\nbeyond a doubt committed the crime of helping rescue a man from\r\nslavery.  I looked for a conviction as a matter of course.  But after\r\nthe judge had charged the jury, hour after hour went by and still\r\nthey stayed out.  The judge sent for them and asked if they required\r\nany further guidance in law or in fact.  The foreman said 'No'; but\r\nthey could not agree, and finally were discharged.\r\n\r\n\"Some years later,\" said Dana, \"as I stood on the steps of the Parker\r\nHouse, a man came up to me and said, 'You don't remember me, Mr.\r\nDana?'  I did not, and he went on:\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Mr. Dana, I expect you remember trying that case where a man\r\nnamed Tucker was indicted for aiding and abetting in the escape of a\r\nfugitive slave.  I was on the jury in that case.'\r\n\r\n\"At this I instantly recalled the facts, and said: 'Since you were on\r\nthat jury, I wish you would tell me what I have always wanted to\r\nknow--why they disagreed.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Mr. Dana, I don't mind telling you we {48} stood eleven to\r\none for conviction, and that one obstinate man wouldn't budge.\r\nPerhaps you remember it was proved on the trial that the negro was\r\ngot away from Boston, taken to Concord, New Hampshire, and there was\r\nhanded over to a man who drove him in a sleigh across the border into\r\nCanada.'\r\n\r\n\"'Oh, yes, I remember that.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, Mr. Dana, I was the man who drove him in the sleigh across\r\nthe border into Canada.'\"\r\n\r\nI knew something of the preposterous charge against Dana, that in\r\nediting Wheaton's _International Law_ he had appropriated the labours\r\nof a dull predecessor, Mr. William Beach Lawrence.  When President\r\nGrant nominated Dana Minister to England in succession to that\r\nGeneral Schenck who is still quoted as an authority on poker, the\r\nLawrence charge was pressed before the Senate Committee on Foreign\r\nRelations.  It was an _ex parte_ hearing, and Dana had no opportunity\r\nto defend himself.  Whether that or the unsleeping malignity of\r\nGeneral Butler did him the more harm I know not, but President Grant,\r\nas his honourable habit was, stood by his nominee; and the Senate\r\nrejected Dana by thirty-one votes to seventeen.  The matter naturally\r\nattracted attention in England, and there were comments, none too\r\njust.  I wrote a letter to _The Times_, of which Mr. Delane was then\r\neditor.  A long letter, something over a column, but Delane published\r\nit next morning in his best type, first striking out a number of\r\ncensorious sentences about Butler {49} and Zach Chandler and other\r\neminent persons who had engineered Dana's defeat.  In my wish to do\r\njustice to Dana and upon his enemies I had not remembered that I was\r\nwriting in an English newspaper, and had no business to be rebuking\r\nAmericans to an English audience.  When I read my letter and noted\r\nDelane's excisions I saw how wrong I had been, and I wrote to Delane\r\nto thank him for suppressing all those ferocities.  There came in\r\nreply such a note as only Delane would have written.\r\n\r\n\"It is the first time anybody ever thanked me for using a blue pencil\r\non a correspondent's letter.  Thank _you_.\"\r\n\r\nThis was in 1876.  Dana's letter to me on my letter about him was\r\ncharacteristic.  I think I might print it, but it is with other\r\npapers in New York.  He was grateful and kindly, but also critical.\r\nHe was always capable of looking at his own case as if it were a\r\nthird person's; his mind detached from everything that was personal\r\nto himself.  He thought the legal points might have been pressed.\r\nBut the public, especially the English public, will not have too much\r\nlaw.  I suppose the Beach-Lawrence suit and the Minister-to-England\r\nbusiness troubled Dana more than anything else in his career.  He\r\nought, of course, to have been Minister.  He would have been such a\r\nMinister as Charles Francis Adams was, or as Phelps was, two of the\r\nAmerican Ministers whom the English liked best; out of the half-dozen\r\nwho have held in this country a {50} pre-eminent position among\r\nMinisters and Ambassadors, including the present Ambassador and his\r\ntwo immediate predecessors, Hay and Choate.  That brilliant list\r\nought to have been enriched with Dana's name; but it was not to be.\r\n\r\nDana came abroad again in 1878, and I saw him once more.  He spent\r\nhis time chiefly in Paris and Rome, and died in Rome, January 7th,\r\n1882.  He lies near Keats and Shelley in the Protestant cemetery at\r\nPorte Pià; and there is a monument.  In Boston he is remembered;\r\nwhether he is remembered elsewhere I have no means of knowing.  But\r\nwe cannot, in whatever part of America, we cannot afford to forget a\r\nman who had all the American virtues in one of the heroic ages of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{51}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA VISIT TO RALPH WALDO EMERSON\r\n\r\nAmong the students at Harvard Law School in 1855 was William Emerson,\r\nfrom Staten Island, New York, nephew of Ralph Waldo Emerson.  He\r\nasked me one day if I would like to know his uncle.  I answered that\r\nhis uncle was the one man whom I most wished to meet, and, with a\r\nword of surprise at my fervour, he offered to arrange it.\r\n\r\nIn these days his surprise may not readily be understood.  Emerson\r\nhas long since taken his place among the Immortals.  But at that time\r\nhis place was still uncertain.  The number of his followers was\r\nlimited; or, as Carlyle said, fourteen years earlier, \"Not the great\r\nreading public, but only the small thinking public have any questions\r\nto ask concerning him.\"  The growth of the thinking mind toward\r\nEmerson had, during those fourteen years, been considerable, but it\r\nwas still, in Matthew Arnold's phrase, only the Remnant to whom\r\nEmerson was a prophet or an inspiration.  To the majority he was a\r\nriddle, and there were not a few of the solid men of Boston who\r\nthought him a child of the Devil.  The Whigism of Massachusetts had\r\nits religious {52} side.  To be a good Whig and one of the elect you\r\nmust be an orthodox Unitarian.\r\n\r\nThe days when Unitarianism was to be a fashionable religion in Boston\r\nwere still distant.  Emerson was not even a Unitarian; he was an\r\nEmersonian.  He not only thought for himself, but announced his\r\nthought from the housetops; and to think for oneself was, in those\r\nconservative days, a dangerous pastime.  He came of a race of\r\npreachers on both sides, an academic race, six generations of them.\r\nFor some three years he was himself a preacher, but presently found\r\nhe could no longer administer the Holy Communion to his congregation,\r\nand therefore resumed his place as a layman.  The platform superseded\r\nthe pulpit.  His sermons became lectures and essays.  He said\r\nhimself, \"My pulpit is the lyceum platform.\"  He became a\r\ntranscendentalist, as his enemies said, a name he repudiated,\r\npreferring to call the transcendental journal he edited _The Dial_.\r\nIt was no less an offence to Boston when Emerson's intellectual\r\nindependence led him into the company of the Abolitionists, though he\r\nnever wholly identified himself with that rebellious band.  His first\r\nseries of Essays had been published as long ago as 1841, in America,\r\nand in the same year in England with a rather patronizing Preface by\r\nCarlyle.  The second series appeared in 1840, and the _Poems_ in 1846.\r\n\r\nIn the 'fifties, therefore, Emerson's ideas had had time to become\r\nknown to those who liked them least.  I fell into deep disgrace with\r\na Boston {53} uncle, a lawyer whose office I afterward entered, first\r\nas student and then as practitioner, when he heard that I had read\r\nEmerson.  There was, moreover, an accomplished young lady who asked\r\nme if it was true that I believed in Emerson, and then desired to be\r\ntold what in fact Emerson believed and taught; one of those appalling\r\nquestions which women sometimes put lightheartedly.  I answered as\r\nbriefly as I could, and she retorted \"I think it perfectly horrid.\"\r\nAnd if that friendship did not come to an end it grew cold, which I\r\nthen thought a misfortune, and perhaps still do.  But society was\r\nthen intolerant of anything which menaced its foundations, or was\r\nthought to.  Rightly, I suppose.  Since all societies in all ages\r\nhave wished to live, and not die.\r\n\r\nIn the Law School we did not discuss Emerson; we ignored him.  I can\r\nthink of no student at that time who had come under his influence.\r\nThey were busy with the law; what was a prophet to them?  If he had\r\nreaders they kept their reading to themselves.  The nephew himself\r\nwas more a nephew than a disciple.  He told me I should find his\r\nuncle delightful to know.  Presently, to my delight, he brought me an\r\ninvitation to Concord for Saturday to Monday.  We walked the thirteen\r\nmiles from Cambridge to Emerson's home, arriving in the middle of\r\nSaturday afternoon.  Photographs have long since made the house\r\nfamiliar, whether in its original state, or after the fire in 1872,\r\nand the restoration of it by his fellow townsmen of Concord, and\r\ntheir {54} honourable gift of it to him.  A broad gateway led to it\r\nfrom the road, pine trees standing sentinel on either side.  Square,\r\nwith a sloping roof, a porch in the centre, two windows on either\r\nside, two stories in height; simple almost to bareness, devoid of\r\narchitectural pretence, but well proportioned.  There was, I think,\r\nan ell which ran back from the main building.  Inside, your first\r\nimpression was of spaciousness; the hall and rooms of good size, not\r\nvery high, and furnished with an eye mainly to comfort; and an easy\r\nstaircase.\r\n\r\nWe were taken first into a parlour in the rear of the library which\r\nfilled one side of the house.  Emerson's greeting was something more\r\nthan courteous--friendly, with a little element of surprise; for\r\nthough he had long been used to pilgrimages and visits from admiring\r\nstrangers, to whom his house was a Mecca, there was, perhaps, a\r\nnovelty in the coming of a law student.  A pleasant light, and a\r\nstrong light, in his fine blue eyes, yet they looked at you in an\r\ninquiring, penetrating way as if it was their duty to give an account\r\nof you; impartial but sympathetic.  You could perceive he was\r\npredisposed to think well of people.  I had seen Emerson on the\r\nplatform, but there his attitude was Hebraic: inspired and apostolic.\r\nThis was the private Emerson, the citizen of Concord, and first of\r\nall the host; intent before all things on hospitality.  The tall,\r\ntwisted figure bent toward us, the grasp of the hand was a welcome;\r\nthe strong face had in it the sunshine of kindliness; the firm lips\r\n{55} relaxing into a smile.  Delicacy went with his strength, and\r\nwith the manliness of the man was blended something I can only call\r\nfeminine, because it was exquisite.  Distinction in every line and\r\ntone; a man apart from other men.  Free from all pretence; of\r\npretence he had no need; he was absolutely himself, and that was all\r\nyou wanted.  There was at first something in his manner you might\r\ncall shyness or uncertainty, as of a nature which might be\r\nembarrassed in unfamiliar company but would go gaily to the stake.\r\n\r\nI suppose I am collecting the impressions of this and many later\r\nmeetings with Emerson, but I cannot distinguish between them, and it\r\ndoes not matter.  What was, however, peculiar to this visit was\r\nEmerson's almost anxious sense of his duties as host; which seemed\r\nnot duties, but the inevitable expression of a loving nature.  When\r\nhe heard that we had walked from Cambridge he said we must be tired\r\nand hungry and thirsty.  We were to sit down there and then, we were\r\nto eat and drink.  The philosopher bustled gently about, seeking wine\r\nand food in the cupboards, and presently putting on the table a\r\ndecanter of Madeira and a dish of plum cake.  He was solicitous that\r\nwe should partake of both; and to that end set us the example,\r\nsaying: \"I have not walked thirteen miles, but I think I can manage\r\nto keep you company at the table.\"  Then he bethought himself that he\r\nseldom touched wine; \"and indeed I sometimes neither eat nor drink\r\nfrom breakfast to supper.\"  He began at {56} once with questionings\r\nabout the law school and our way of life and study.\r\n\r\nThen to our rooms, plain, pleasant rooms, and then tea in the\r\nlibrary.  Among the books he seemed more at home than anywhere else;\r\nthey had been his lifelong friends, for whom he had an affection.  He\r\nasked again about law and the law school.  \"A noble study,\" he said,\r\n\"one to which you may well devote a great part of your life and mind.\r\nAs you have chosen it for your profession I am sure you will master\r\nit; a man must know his trade or he will do nothing.  But law is not\r\neverything.  It does not perhaps make a demand upon all the resources\r\nof the intellect, nor enlarge a man's nature.\"  Which was almost a\r\nparaphrase of Burke's famous sentence on the wall in his eulogy on\r\nMr. Grenville:\r\n\r\n\r\n    One of the first and noblest of human sciences; a science which\r\n    does more to quicken and invigorate the understanding than all\r\n    the other kinds of learning put together; but it is not apt,\r\n    except in persons very happily born, to open and to liberalize\r\n    the mind exactly in the same proportion.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Emerson, who seemed always to be seeking the final word, and to\r\ncondense the whole of his thought into a sentence, added:\r\n\r\n\"Keep your mind open.  Read Plato.\"\r\n\r\nThose half-dozen words he uttered in the resonant tones of the\r\nplatform; tones which came when he was deeply stirred and desired to\r\nstir his audience.  They vibrated through the room as {57} they\r\nvibrated through a great hall; tones which were meant to find their\r\nway, and did find their way, to the hearts of his hearers; an appeal\r\nto the emotions, to the conscience, to whatever there was in these\r\nthousands, or in the single individual, sympathetic to the speaker.\r\nI have never forgotten them.  If I have not followed Emerson's advice\r\nas he meant it, or in full, I have followed it to a certain extent;\r\ndesultorily, inadequately; and certainly with no settled purpose to\r\nbecome a Platonist, or even an Emersonian.  But it had an effect and\r\nthe effect has been permanent.\r\n\r\nOne other great thinker, Pascal, has given the same counsel; not in\r\nwords, but by his perpetual example.  You cannot read Pascal without\r\nseeing that he never states one side of a case, but always two sides.\r\nEven in matters of faith he keeps an open mind.  In matters of\r\nscience it is equally open; and in all other matters.  To this day,\r\nit is disputed whether Pascal was a believer.  He himself believed\r\nthat he was, but he was a pupil of Montaigne, and Montaigne's motto,\r\n\"Que sçais-je?\" is inwoven in every sentence of Pascal's speculations\r\nupon matters of faith; and upon all _les choses de l'esprit_.  So I\r\nput these two influences, Pascal and Emerson, side by side.\r\n\r\nIf this were the place, a parallel might be drawn.  The Church, and\r\nfor good cause, held Pascal for an enemy; and the Puritanism of New\r\nEngland, as well as orthodoxy in Old England and elsewhere, held\r\nEmerson for an enemy; also {58} with good cause.  Yet were they two\r\nof the most devout souls of all time.  Why should the churches of\r\nFrance and of New England array against themselves the two finest\r\nminds of those two communities, centuries apart?  Pascal's voice\r\ncomes softly down the intervening generations--\"Keep your mind\r\nopen\"--and Emerson's is the clear echo of Pascal's, as Pascal's was\r\nof Montaigne.  Emerson, too, sat for a time at the feet of Montaigne,\r\nchose him as one of his \"Representative Men,\" and said of Montaigne's\r\nEssays: \"It seems to me as if I had myself written the book in some\r\nformer life.\"  Pascal had already said: \"Ce n'est pas dans Montaigne\r\nmais dans moi que je trouve tout ce que j'y vois.\"\r\n\r\nEmerson had other stimulating suggestions ready; his talk overflowed\r\nwith them, yet was never didactic.  It was as if the suggestions\r\npresented themselves first to him and then to you; as if he shared\r\nhis thoughts with you; so far was he from the method of the pulpit.\r\nSome errand called him away.  He took down a volume and put it into\r\nmy hand, saying: \"Some day I hope you will learn to value this\r\nwriter.  He has much to say, and he says it in almost the best\r\nEnglish of his century.  He is a Greek born out of due time\"--a\r\nremark he has somewhere made about Winckelmann.  It was Landor; a\r\nvolume of the _Imaginary Conversations_.  I read a dialogue there and\r\nthen.  I have read him ever since.  I do not suppose anybody cares\r\nwhat I have read or not read.  But I wish to give you Emerson's {59}\r\nopinion; the advice he thought best for a boy studying law; and the\r\neffect of it upon the boy.\r\n\r\nFor he would not talk of what he thought unsuited to us two, or to\r\nme.  In a reminiscence or two of his tour in England in 1846 or 1847\r\nhe mentioned a visit to Coleridge.  I had read the _Table Talk_ and\r\nthe _Biographia Literaria_, and I asked Emerson to tell me what he\r\nand Coleridge had discussed.  \"No,\" he said, \"it would not interest\r\nyou.\"  In the same way next morning when he took me to Walden through\r\nthe woods, he began upon trees and squirrels and other forest-lore;\r\nthen stopped and asked: \"But do you know about trees and animals?  Do\r\nthey interest you?\"  I had to confess they did not; upon which he\r\nbegan again on books and matters of literature; and upon Thoreau.  Of\r\nThoreau he did not seem to care to say very much.  But he showed me\r\nthe lake, and where Thoreau lived, and what he related of him, though\r\nhis appreciation was critical, was touched with the kindness habitual\r\nto him.  I had read the _Week on the Concord and Merrimac Rivers_--or\r\nperhaps read it later--and _Walden_, which is thinner, and I had\r\nheard, then or since, that some of Thoreau's admirers accused Emerson\r\nof borrowing from him.  But there was not much to borrow; nor, for\r\nEmerson, anything.  The friendship between the two men was close and\r\nlasted long, but if there were any question of borrowing or lending\r\nin the books of either, the debt was not on Emerson's side.\r\n\r\nNow and then as we walked in the forest, or {60} through the streets,\r\nwe met a farmer or other resident of Concord, and it was pleasant to\r\nsee their greetings to their great townsman.  On the heights he trod\r\nno other set foot, but in the daily business and intercourse of life\r\nhe was each man's friend, and each was his.  One of them told me--it\r\nwas Rockwood Hoar, afterward Judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nMassachusetts and United States Attorney-General--that half the\r\naffairs of Concord were on Emerson's shoulders.  He was the chosen\r\nadviser, peacemaker, arbitrator between these hard-headed, practical\r\npeople of Concord; the man to whom they went with their troubles; the\r\nman whose decision in difficult disputes was accepted without demur.\r\n\"I don't suppose,\" said Mr. Hoar, \"that Emerson ever opened a law\r\nbook or the Revised Statutes.  But he had a native shrewdness, an eye\r\nfor the points of a case, a sense of equity, and a willingness to\r\ntake pains which made him an ideal referee.\"  I once told an eminent\r\nWhig who had been abusing Emerson as a mere visionary, that his\r\nneighbours, who knew him best, trusted him in this way.  \"They are\r\nwelcome to him,\" growled the eminent Whig.\r\n\r\nHe also was welcome to them.  He was the possession and pride of\r\nConcord; beloved by the people among whom he lived his life.  I\r\nsuppose his lines about the embattled farmers who fired the shot\r\nheard round the world, are better known and have thrilled more hearts\r\nthan any others he ever wrote.  They seemed to be always on {61}\r\nConcord lips.  Yes, but Emerson himself had fired another shot heard\r\nround the world; or round so much of it as speaks the English, or\r\nAnglo-American, tongue.  So when misfortune befell him and his house\r\nwas half burnt, and his health failed, they besought him to go abroad\r\nfor rest; and while he was gone they rebuilt his house for him in the\r\nexact similitude of the old.  He was gone a year, all but two months,\r\nwith his daughter Ellen, the true child of her father and his most\r\nfaithful and helpful friend.  When Emerson returned, Concord turned\r\nout to greet him, built a triumphal arch beneath which he had,\r\nperhaps reluctantly, to pass; and so reinstalled him in his old-new\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was long after the time of which I am writing; in\r\n1872-3.  But when he came to England, he knew that his friends in\r\nConcord were rebuilding his house.  He could not speak of it without\r\nemotion.  His state of health was such that emotion was hurtful to\r\nhim, and his daughter used to ask us not to refer to the house.  But\r\nwhether we did or not, Emerson brooded over it, and was better and\r\nhappier in the thought of his friends' friendship for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{62}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n  EMERSON IN ENGLAND--ENGLISH TRAITS--EMERSON\r\n  AND MATTHEW ARNOLD\r\n\r\nEmerson's last visit to England was made in 1873, after his health\r\nhad failed.  He had been in Egypt and on the Continent, hoping to\r\nrecover the freshness of his mental powers; but that was not to be.\r\nIn London he and his daughter Ellen, who gave to her father a loving\r\ndevotion without limits, lived in apartments in Down Street,\r\nPiccadilly.  It was only too evident that, even after ten months of\r\nrest and travel, he was an invalid in mind.  He could not recollect\r\nnames--a failing common in advanced age, of course, but Emerson was\r\nonly in his seventieth year and was to live ten years more.  He\r\nresorted to all kinds of paraphrases and circumlocutions.  \"One of\r\nthe men who seemed to me the most sincere and clear-minded I have met\r\nwas--you know whom I mean, I met him at your house, the biologist,\r\nthe champion of Darwin--with what lucid energy he talked to us.\"\r\nWhen I mentioned Huxley's name, Emerson said, \"Yes, how could I\r\nforget him?\"  But presently the name had to be given to him again.\r\nThe power of association {63} between people or things and the names\r\nof them had been lost.  He was always, said the critics, a little\r\n_déconsu_; sentences, they insisted, succeeded each other without\r\nmuch obvious connection, or without the copula which would have\r\nbrought them into their true relation.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, he gave his reader credit for a little imaginative\r\npower.  He took him into partnership.  He was mindful of Voltaire's\r\npungent epigram: \"_L'art d'être ennuyeux, c'est l'art de tout,\r\ndire_.\"  He had his own theory of style and of diction.  His\r\ntemperament left him no choice.  If his quickness of transition from\r\none subject to another, or from one thought to another, left some of\r\nhis readers toiling after him in vain, they were not the readers for\r\nwhom he wrote.  Why should they read him if he wrote a language to\r\nthem unknown?\r\n\r\nThe interview between Huxley and himself to which Emerson referred\r\nwas at breakfast; for breakfasts were then given almost as often as\r\nluncheons are now.  There were a dozen or so people to meet him; men\r\nand women.  I introduced each of them as they arrived.  In each case\r\nthey had been asked to make Emerson's acquaintance, but to some of\r\nthem Emerson was an unknown name; or, if not wholly unknown, called\r\nup in their minds no clear image of the man or knowledge of his\r\nlife's work.  \"Tell me who he is.\"  \"Tell me what he has done.\"  \"Is\r\nhe English or American?\"  But I suppose there never has been a time\r\nwhen a knowledge of {64} literature, or of great spiritual\r\ninfluences, has been an indispensable passport to social position.\r\nNor was it because Emerson was an American that he was unfamiliar to\r\nthese delightful and, in many ways, accomplished women.\r\n\r\nYears afterward, in 1888, I was engaged to lunch on the day when news\r\nof Matthew Arnold's death had come.  Arnold had been so good a friend\r\nto me that I did not like going on this first moment to such an\r\nentertainment, but I thought the talk would turn on Arnold, and I\r\nwent.  My hostess was a woman renowned in the world, or in her world,\r\nfor great qualities, known to everybody, and I should have thought\r\nknowing everybody who had, as Arnold had, a place both in letters and\r\nin society.  I referred to his sudden death.  \"Ah, yes,\" she\r\nanswered, \"an American, was he not?\"  That may be set off against the\r\nunacquaintance of these other ladies with Emerson.\r\n\r\nWhat Emerson cared for was to meet the men and women who stood in\r\nsome spiritual or intellectual relation to him; or who were his\r\ndisciples.  Mr. Alexander Ireland, in his biographical sketch of\r\nEmerson, quotes an illustrative story.  It was in Edinburgh, this\r\nsame year, and Dr. William Smith, President of the Edinburgh\r\nPhilosophical Association, was driving him about that wonderful city.\r\nDr. Smith had told him of \"a worthy tradesman in Nicholas Street who\r\nis his enthusiastic admirer.\"  When Emerson heard of it, he proposed\r\nto call on him.  They stopped at the {65} \"worthy tradesman's,\" and\r\nDr. Smith went into the shop and said: \"Mr. ----, Mr. Emerson is at\r\nthe door and will be glad to see you for a few minutes.\"  \"The five\r\nminutes were well spent,\" adds Dr. Smith; and the disciple was happy\r\nfor the rest of his life.  It was characteristic of Emerson, and of\r\nEmerson as an American.  Very likely he did not quite understand how\r\nimmense is the gulf which in this country separates the man who\r\nstands behind a counter from the man who stands in front of the\r\ncounter.  If he had understood, he would not have cared.  What he\r\ncared for was the point of contact, and of discipleship.  It was the\r\nmaster who sought his pupil, because he was his pupil.\r\n\r\nDuring Emerson's too brief stay in London I called often in Down\r\nStreet.  Miss Ellen was anxious to protect her father against the\r\npressure from many quarters for public addresses, and to decline as\r\nmany private invitations as possible.  At Oxford it was the same, but\r\nneither in Oxford nor London did Emerson lecture except briefly at\r\nMr. Thomas Hughes's Working-men's College.  Between him and Tom\r\nHughes--he was never called anything else--there was not very much in\r\ncommon except sterling qualities of character.  Hughes was a good and\r\namiable Philistine, English to the tips of his fingers, who wrote one\r\nbook, _Tom Brown's Schooldays_, which is immortal, and half a dozen\r\nothers that are dead or were never really alive.  But Hughes was one\r\nof our friends in the black days when we had few in England, {66}\r\nworking-men excepted; and Emerson was too good a patriot to forget\r\nthat; and too much a lover of manliness in men not to like one who\r\nhad that supreme trait in a high degree, as Hughes had.  So he made\r\nthe exception in his favour, for the Working-men's College was an\r\ninstitution of high usefulness, in which Hughes's heart was bound up.\r\nAs for society, Emerson was an invalid, and able on that ground to\r\ndecline invitations without offence.  He had studied English society,\r\nas one form of English life, when here in 1848; and was content with\r\nthat experience.  \"I do not care for classes,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century produced two supremely good books on American\r\nand on English civilization: Tocqueville's _De la Démocratic en\r\nAmérique_ and Emerson's _English Traits_, published in 1856.\r\nTocqueville's book, published in 1835, remains the best book on the\r\nUnited States for the student who cares to get down to the foundation\r\nof things; who cares more for ideas, tendencies, and principles than\r\nfor details.  Of Emerson's the same thing may be said, yet no two\r\ntreatises could be more unlike than those of the Frenchman and the\r\nAmerican.\r\n\r\nBut all I wish now to point out is the effect of _English Traits_\r\nupon the English themselves.  Roughly speaking, it puzzled them.  It\r\nis one of the truest books ever written.  Yet to the English\r\nthemselves its truth has never appeared quite true.  On Emerson, as\r\nthinker, poet, philosopher, all kinds of judgments have been formed\r\n{67} in England, and expressed, in some cases, with vehemence.  He\r\nhas always had an audience and a following here; and always enemies.\r\nBut the book they least understand is the book about themselves.\r\nLooking into the egregious Allibone for an apt quotation concerning\r\nthe _Traits_ I find none, but instead a remark by Allibone himself\r\nthat \"Mr. Emerson's writings have excited considerable interest on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic!\"  The space given to Emerson in the\r\n_Dictionary of English Literature_ is less than a column, though\r\nfourteen columns are not thought too many for Longfellow; nor are\r\nthey.  In the Supplement Emerson gets a little more attention; still\r\ngrudgingly given.\r\n\r\nAllibone does not matter, and the perplexity of the Philistine\r\nstruggling with a book he cannot understand does not matter.  But let\r\nus go at once to the best of English critics; to Matthew Arnold.\r\nAlas! we fare no better.  Arnold's Discourse on Emerson has been\r\nresented by Emersonians as an elaborate disparagement of their\r\nMaster.  It is not that.  Arnold was incapable of disparagement, and\r\nwhile he denies to Emerson many gifts which his readers find in him,\r\nhis appreciation is still sympathetic, and he lifts himself to own\r\nfrom time to time Emerson's real greatness.  He thinks the _Essays_\r\n\"the most important work done in prose in our language\" during the\r\nlast century--\"more important than Carlyle's.\"  But he puts aside the\r\n_English Traits_ because, compared with Montaigne, La Bruyère, {68}\r\nAddison (!), the _Traits_ will not stand the comparison.\r\n\r\n\"Emerson's observation has not the disinterested quality of the\r\nobservation of these masters.  It is the observation of a man\r\nsystematically benevolent, as Hawthorne's observation in _Our Old\r\nHome_ is the work of a man chagrined.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Arnold explains that Emerson's systematic benevolence comes from\r\nhis persistent optimism.  The book is too good-natured to be\r\nscientific.  Yet, oddly enough--or perhaps not oddly--the criticism\r\nof the English Philistine is the exact opposite of Arnold's.  The man\r\nin the street, if he has read the _English Traits_, complains that\r\nthe criticism of things English is too relentless; that Emerson\r\nalways has the scalpel and the probe in hand; that the inquiry is not\r\ncritical but anatomical; and the atmosphere that of the dissecting\r\nroom.  He is appalled when he sees the most cherished beliefs of\r\ncenturies and blended races put under the microscope, and when\r\nCharacter, Aristocracy, Plutocracy, the Church, Religion itself are\r\nmade to take off their masks and yield up their secrets.  They are\r\nnot conciliated even when Emerson sums up the English as \"the best of\r\nactual races.\"  What care they for comparisons with other races, or\r\nfor the opinion of other races, or of transatlantic critics upon\r\nEngland and the English and the institutions of this little island?\r\nEmerson's criticism is chemical, it resolves things into their\r\nelements, their primordial atoms.  No doubt, but neither the Throne\r\nnor {69} the Church is shaken, nor a single Act of Parliament\r\nrepealed.\r\n\r\nArnold, recalling the influences which wrought upon him as a student\r\nat Oxford \"amid the last enchantments of the Middle Ages,\" said to an\r\nAmerican audience in Emerson's \"own delightful town,\" Boston:\r\n\r\n\"He was your Newman, your man of soul and genius visible to you in\r\nthe flesh, speaking to your bodily ears, a present object for your\r\nheart and imagination.  That is surely the most potent of all\r\ninfluences!  Nothing can come up to it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd that is the influence which descended beneficially upon us of a\r\npast or passing generation, to whom it was given to see Emerson and\r\nto hear him.  As I think it all over, I begin to doubt whether to\r\nhave heard Emerson on the platform did not bring you a sense of\r\ngreater intimacy than to have known him even in his Concord home.\r\n\r\nThere was a time, during Theodore Parker's illness and absence, when\r\nEmerson and Wendell Phillips used to take his place at stated\r\nintervals--in both cases, I think, once a month.  Before the great\r\naudience of the Music Hall, Emerson had precisely the same manner as\r\nwith a few hundred people.  He hardly seemed to be aware of his\r\naudience.  He stood there behind Parker's desk, towering above it,\r\nhis slight figure adjusting itself to whatever attitude suited his\r\nmood for the moment; never quite erect; the body never quite\r\nstraight; the hands fumbling with his {70} manuscript; turning over a\r\ndozen leaves at a time; turning back again another dozen, as if it\r\nscarce mattered in what order he read.  Often he skipped; the large\r\nquarto pages were turned by the score and there was no return.  His\r\nmind seemed to be carrying on processes of thought quite independent\r\nof those he had inscribed on his manuscript.  He felt his way with\r\nhis hearers; and his unconsciousness of their presence was therefore\r\napparent only.  Between them and him there was the flow of invisible,\r\nmysterious currents, whether of sympathy or antipathy.  In Mr.\r\nGladstone's fine image, they gave back to him in vapour what he\r\npoured out in a flood upon them.  But that, of course, was far more\r\ncompletely true of an orator like Mr. Gladstone than of a lecturer\r\nlike Emerson who read his discourse.  But it was true in a measure of\r\nEmerson also.\r\n\r\nBut Emerson was an orator too.  He was not always above the arts of\r\nthe orator.  He could, and did, calculate his effects; observing the\r\nwhile whether they told or not.  He delighted in a crescendo.  His\r\nvoice rose and fell and rose again; and he had unsuspected depths of\r\nresonant tone.  At one moment clear and cold, then vibrating with\r\nemotion, in which the whole force of the man seemed to seek\r\nexpression; then sometimes at the very end becoming prophetic,\r\nappealing, menacing; till the sentences came as if from the Judgment\r\nseat.  He once read Allingham's poem, \"The Talisman,\" as the\r\nperoration of his address in the Music Hall.  I never heard anything\r\nlike {71} it--like the wild, strange melody of his voice, which had\r\nin it the intonations and cadences which give to many Slavic airs,\r\nand most of all to the Hungarian Czardas, though that is dance music,\r\na magic charm.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the prejudice against Emerson which prevailed in\r\nBoston and elsewhere.  It was most vehement in society.  That\r\nworshipful company, which is necessarily a minority and prides itself\r\non being a minority, likes to set its own standards and expects the\r\nrest of the world, so far as it comes in contact with these social\r\nlaw-givers, to conform to these standards.  They soon became aware\r\nthat to no standard but his own did Emerson ever conform; save so far\r\nas civility and kindness bade him.  He gave way readily enough in\r\nlittle things.  It is a sign of greatness to hold little things of\r\nlittle account; an aphorism by no means universally accepted.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was not Emerson's manners to which society objected, or\r\ncould ever object.  He had the manners of a king, without the demands\r\nof a king.  He was a republican king.  He stood for equality, in the\r\nsense that he looked down on no man.  The society view is different.\r\nSociety exists in order to look down on all who are not within its\r\nsacred circle.  They must be inferior because they are outside.  But\r\nits objection to Emerson lay deeper.  It recognized in him the\r\nnatural enemy of privilege and prerogative.  There were distinguished\r\nmembers of this distinguished body who regarded a man who took {72}\r\nthe liberty of examining the substructure on which all societies are\r\nbuilt as an anarchist.  They were afraid of him.  They thought it\r\nsafer to exclude him.  By and by, they compromised.  Is not, or was\r\nnot, Boston the Home of Culture?  So, as Emerson's fame grew, the\r\nexclusion policy was seen to be feeble.  But when the closed doors\r\nwere opened, what was the astonishment of these excellent persons to\r\ndiscover that Emerson did not seem to care whether they were open or\r\nclosed.  He had his own life to live, and lived it, serenely aloof.\r\n\r\nNothing dies so hard as a prejudice.  I have one of my own which\r\nlives in spite of my affection for Emerson, and my many debts to him,\r\nand my gratitude that he gave me a little of his friendship.  I mean\r\nthat on a too young mind he had, or might have, an influence not\r\nentirely for good.  He set his ideals so high that, as you looked up\r\nto him and them, your feet sometimes went astray, or stumbled.  He\r\ntaught you, though he may not have meant it, to underrate precision\r\nof knowledge, and the value of details.  When the things of the\r\nspirit and the spiritual life mattered so much, how could it be worth\r\nwhile to know all the tenses of Greek verbs or to be aware of the\r\nrudiments of toe in the palæontological horse?  There are sentences\r\nand pages in _The Conduct of Life_ and elsewhere which refute this\r\nview, and I do not press it.  But I know the effect, not of this or\r\nthat essay, but of Emerson's attitude toward education, and his\r\nphilosophic indifference {73} to all but what is highest in thought.\r\nAnd I think even to-day I would not put his books into the hands of a\r\nboy who had not settled views about learning, and a conviction of the\r\ninvincible necessity of an accurate method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{74}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA GROUP OF BOSTON LAWYERS--MR. OLNEY AND VENEZUELA\r\n\r\nA name still remembered in Massachusetts is that of Judge Thomas of\r\nthe Supreme Court, the court of highest jurisdiction in that State,\r\nand one of the few State courts whose decisions have always been\r\ncited with respect in the Supreme Court of the United States.  It was\r\nrecruited largely from the Suffolk Bar.  The Boston Bar was known as\r\nthe Suffolk Bar, the name of the county.  But, of course, other parts\r\nof the State supplied judges, and Worcester County was one.  Judge\r\nThomas lived and practised law in the town of Worcester.  He\r\npractised politics also, of a very energetic kind, being a good\r\nplatform speaker and a good organizer.  There used to be a story that\r\none morning, in the heat of an exciting campaign, Thomas knelt at\r\nfamily prayers and began his invocation to the Almighty:\r\n\"Fellow-citizens and Whigs of Worcester County.\"\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, he was a successful lawyer, a successful judge,\r\nand had attractive qualities not always to be found at the Bar.  I\r\n{75} will tell you in a moment in what way he connects himself\r\npermanently with national and international history.  I came to know\r\nabout it because it was before Judge Thomas that I tried, at _nisi\r\nprius_, and lost, my first case in the Supreme Court.  When the jury\r\nhad delivered their wrongful verdict, and been sent about their\r\nbusiness, Judge Thomas called me up and spoke to me with a kindness I\r\nhave never forgotten.  He thought I had tried my case well, told me I\r\nshould do well at the Bar, and offered, very generously, to help me\r\nif he could.  After a time he resigned his seat on the Bench and went\r\ninto practice in Boston.  A little later I called on him and asked\r\nwhether he had room for a junior in his office.  \"There would have\r\nbeen room if you had applied earlier,\" said Judge Thomas.  \"But I\r\nhave just been told by my daughter that she has engaged herself to a\r\nyoung lawyer, and he is to have the place I should otherwise have\r\nbeen glad to offer you.\"\r\n\r\nThe name of that young lawyer was Richard Olney.  It fell to my lot\r\nto see something of him in Washington forty years later, when he was\r\nSecretary of State under President Cleveland.  I saw him for some\r\nweeks, during the height of the Venezuela crisis, almost daily.\r\nWhether I shall ever be allowed to tell the whole story of what went\r\non during those weeks I do not know.  If I were Mr. Olney I would\r\ngive my assent to the publishing of a complete statement.  I say that\r\nbecause, in my judgment, we owe it to Mr. Olney--and among Americans\r\nto him {76} only--that a way out of the difficulty in which President\r\nCleveland's Message had landed us was ultimately found.  I know how\r\nit was found, and except Mr. Olney himself, I don't think any other\r\nAmerican knows.  I am aware of the explanations which Mr. Cleveland\r\npublished in _The Century Magazine_, and I think them models of\r\nunintentional disingenuousness.  Moreover, I had means of knowing\r\nwhat was said and done on this side, in England, in the Foreign\r\nOffice and elsewhere, during those dangerous weeks; and I know why\r\nthe settlement was postponed till next summer, when the American\r\npeople, at white heat during December, 1895, and January, 1896, had\r\ncooled off and forgotten there was any crisis at all.\r\n\r\nBut if I never had a chance of saying more, I wish to say now that\r\nMr. Olney did a great service to his country, and to both countries;\r\none of the greatest ever done by any man in his position, or in\r\nalmost any position.  I think Mr. Cleveland became aware that he had\r\nacted rashly and with no full knowledge of the history of that\r\nboundary-line between British Guiana and Venezuela which he announced\r\nto the world his intention to re-draw to suit himself, with menace of\r\nwar to Great Britain.  I don't forget Mr. Olney's share in the\r\ndispatch of July, 1895, which began the trouble.  He and Mr.\r\nCleveland concocted that extraordinary document between them at Gray\r\nGables.  I suppose he knew also of Mr. Cleveland's Message to\r\nCongress, December 12th, and perhaps approved of it--indeed, he must\r\n{77} have approved of it or resigned.  He must also have been\r\nresponsible for the second dispatch calling upon Lord Salisbury to\r\nsend an answer to the July dispatch before the meeting of Congress in\r\nDecember; a demand perhaps unprecedented as between two Powers of the\r\nfirst rank.  I know, too, that some of Mr. Olney's language gave\r\noffence.  Lord Salisbury thought him rude; an impression due mainly\r\nto the different uses made of the English language in Washington and\r\nin London, and to the non-existence in Washington, at that time, of\r\nthat diplomatic freemasonry, in both speech and act, and of those\r\ndiplomatic conventionalities which prevail in other important\r\ncapitals of the world.\r\n\r\nAll that--and there is more--only emphasizes the delicacy with which\r\nMr. Olney subsequently handled the dispute which Mr. Cleveland had\r\nenvenomed.  A new period in the negotiations began.  I shall venture\r\nto say, even though Mr. Olney, out of loyalty to his President might\r\nrefuse to admit it, that with the New Year of 1896 the conduct of the\r\nnegotiations passed into his hands.  That he reported to the\r\nPresident what was going on I don't doubt.  But a new spirit\r\nprevailed.  The tone which had been so offensive in the original\r\ndispatch, and still more in the Message to Congress, was dropped.\r\nMr. Olney had a wonderful flexibility of mind.  When he saw that one\r\nset of tactics had failed, he was quick to try another, and not only\r\nto try another but to recognize the need of a wholly new departure.\r\n{78} He was equally quick in invention, in devising expedients, in\r\nlooking at facts with a fresh pair of eyes.  A trained diplomatist he\r\nwas not, but in this emergency he showed the qualities of a trained\r\ndiplomatist; the resource, the tact, the fertility, and the power of\r\ndivining what was in his adversary's mind.\r\n\r\nLord Salisbury's was not an easy mind to divine.  He had the gift of\r\nsilence, and to a still more remarkable degree the gift of enveloping\r\nhis thought in that language of diplomacy which, as I said, was not\r\nat that time a language very well understood in America.  But Mr.\r\nOlney guessed pretty accurately at Lord Salisbury's purpose, and they\r\ncarried on their exchange of views without very great friction.  The\r\ntruth is, both were bent on finding a solution.  The point in which\r\nLord Salisbury had the advantage was patience.  Mr. Olney was under\r\nsome pressure.  Lord Salisbury was not.  Americans will, I think, do\r\nwell to bear in mind that, after Prince Bismarck's death, Lord\r\nSalisbury was regarded throughout Europe as a higher authority, with\r\na more commanding influence, than any Foreign Minister then in power.\r\nHe had immense experience, immense knowledge, an immense power of\r\nwork, and fine natural gifts perfected by long practice.  There were\r\nnot many Ministers who transacted great affairs with Lord Salisbury\r\non even terms.  But Mr. Olney was one of them.\r\n\r\nI find myself, however, going further than I meant to.  I meant no\r\nmore than to put on {79} record, before it is too late, the testimony\r\nof an eye-witness, and my belief that, but for Mr. Olney, there might\r\nhave been a very different ending to the quarrel upon which President\r\nCleveland entered in his over-confident, clumsy way.  I have departed\r\nfrom the order of time in these \"Memories.\"  I must often depart from\r\nit; I cannot begin a story and leave it half told because the end\r\nbelongs to later years.\r\n\r\nMr. Olney has made so great a name and place for himself at the Bar,\r\nas well as in the State Department, that no testimony or tribute can\r\nbe of much importance to him.  But it is important to me to offer it.\r\nA debt of gratitude may be easily borne, often much too easily; but\r\nif it can never be repaid it can be acknowledged, and I acknowledge\r\nmine to Mr. Olney at the same time that I remind others of what they\r\nalso owe him.\r\n\r\nI do not regret having had to give way to Mr. Olney in Judge Thomas's\r\noffice.  If I had been admitted into that coveted place, I should\r\nhave stayed in Boston and at the Bar, and perhaps have had a\r\nprosperous professional life.  But I should not have had the kind of\r\nexperience which has made life interesting to me in so many various\r\nways, and which I am now trying to make interesting to others.\r\n\r\nMr. Rockwood Hoar, afterward Attorney-General of the United States,\r\nwhose name I have mentioned earlier, was counsel for the other side\r\nin my Supreme Court case.  If my client had {80} had a good defence,\r\nwhich perhaps he had not, a novice at the Bar had little chance\r\nagainst a man with the learning and force of Mr. Hoar.  He had,\r\nhowever, a spirit of scrupulous fairness.  No man ever suspected\r\nRockwood Hoar of unworthy devices.  He was too able to need them and\r\ntoo honest to use them.  But he tried experiments, as every lawyer\r\ndoes.  He put a question to a witness which I thought innocent\r\nenough, but a friendly lawyer who sat near called to me in a stage\r\nwhisper, \"Object.\"  So I objected, not the least knowing why.  The\r\njudge looked to Mr. Hoar.  \"Surely,\" said Mr. Hoar, \"my friend will\r\nnot press his objection.\"  Not knowing what else to say, I said I\r\nwould withdraw the objection if Mr. Hoar would say he thought the\r\nquestion competent.  The judge smiled, and Mr. Hoar smiled at my\r\ningenuousness, and said, \"Well, I will ask the witness another\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Horace Gray was at that time reporter to the Supreme Court of\r\nMassachusetts.  After he had become a judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nthe United States I used to meet him in Washington.  One day he said\r\nto me:\r\n\r\n\"You used to practise law in Boston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think we must have met.  I must have seen you in court.  You tried\r\na case in the Supreme Court before Judge Thomas.  Stop a moment.  I\r\ncan tell you the name of the case.  You argued it afterward before\r\nthe full bench.  It was Krebs _v._ Oliver.\"\r\n\r\n{81}\r\n\r\nAnd it was.  Forty years had passed.  Mr. Justice Gray had what may\r\nbe called a memory.  He had much else: an inexhaustible knowledge of\r\ncase law; a power of dealing readily with complex matters; a fast\r\nhold of principles; an industry without limit; the cordial respect of\r\nhis fellow judges; and a pleasant house in Washington whereof the\r\nhostess was one of Washington's favourites.  And he had a stature of\r\nsomewhere between six and seven feet, with a smiling face and massive\r\nhead to crown this huge frame.  He is gone.  I wish he were not.\r\n\r\nOf the many members of this brilliant Suffolk Bar there was one of a\r\nvery unusual kind of brilliancy.  The brilliancy of invariable\r\nsuccess was his.  I believe it to be literally true that during many\r\nyears he never lost a case which depended on the verdict of a jury.\r\nAt the Bar, of course, as elsewhere, nothing succeeds like success,\r\nand Mr. Durant's practice was very large.  I have noticed that\r\nclients, as a rule, would rather win their cases than lose them.  How\r\ndid he do it?  Nobody ever knew.  His beaten rivals, or perhaps their\r\nclients, sometimes hinted at things nobody ever ventured to assert,\r\nsince there was not a scintilla of evidence to justify insinuations.\r\n\r\nThere was probably no secret save what lay on the surface.  Mr.\r\nDurant was a good lawyer who prepared his cases with a thoroughness\r\nthat left no point in doubt, and no scrap of evidence unexamined.  He\r\nknew to a nicety what would {82} tell with a jury and what would not.\r\nHe was not a man on whom it was possible to spring a surprise.  His\r\ncross-examinations, without being showy, were deadly.  As a\r\nspeaker--orator he was not--he had no other conspicuous merit than\r\nclearness; the art of marshalling facts to fit his own theory of the\r\ncase.  When he rose the jury were predisposed to believe.\r\n\r\nHe had a way of turning to the jury whenever during the trial he had\r\nmade a point, brought out a telling fact, or wrung an admission from\r\nan incautious witness.  It was as if from the beginning he took the\r\njury into partnership; it was a matter in which he and they were\r\nalike interested, and the only interest of either was to discover the\r\ntruth.  They said of him what was said by a juryman of another famous\r\nadvocate: \"It's no credit to him to win his causes.  He is always on\r\nthe right side.\"  When Mr. Durant sat down the jury were convinced\r\nthat he, too, was on the right side, and their verdict was but the\r\nformal and legal ratification of the moral view, and, as they\r\nbelieved, of their own conscientious conviction.\r\n\r\nHypnotism?  I think not.  The thing was not much heard of in those\r\ndays.  It is quite possible that Mr. Durant used discrimination and\r\nnever took a cause into court in which he did not feel sure of a\r\nverdict, but many a lawyer is sure of a verdict he does not get.\r\nThere remains a residuum of mystery which has never been explained,\r\nand is probably inexplicable.  Mr. Durant's {83} presence explained\r\nsomething.  He had a powerful head, chiselled features, black hair,\r\nwhich he wore rather long, an olive complexion, and eyes which\r\nflashed the lightnings of wrath and scorn and irony; then suddenly\r\nthe soft rays of sweetness and persuasion for the jury.  He looked\r\nlike an actor.  He was an actor.  He understood dramatic values, and\r\nthere was no art of the stage he did not employ upon a hostile or\r\nunwilling witness.  He could coax, intimidate, terrify; and his\r\nquestions cut like knives.\r\n\r\nHe had a stage name, like so many other actors.  His real name was\r\nSmith, which perhaps was not generally known.  But one day in court\r\nhe was tormenting a reluctant witness who had been Jones and was now\r\nRobinson.  \"Mr. Jones,\" cried Durant--\"I beg your pardon, Mr.\r\nRobinson.\"  \"Yes, Mr. Smith,\" retorted the witness--\"I beg your\r\npardon, Mr. Durant.\"  That cross-examination came quickly to an end.\r\nBut I believe Mr. Durant's prestige continued while he remained at\r\nthe Bar; then having amassed a fortune, he abandoned the law and took\r\nto preaching.  Whether he had the same success in saving souls as in\r\nwinning causes I never heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{84}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS\r\n\r\nIt was in the winter of 1860-61 that the Massachusetts allies of the\r\nSouthern Slave Power made their last effort.  Spite of Webster's\r\ndeath, with whom died the brains of the party and its vital force,\r\nthese men were still powerful in Boston.  The surrender of Anthony\r\nBurns in May, 1854, the birth of the Republican Party at Worcester in\r\nJuly of the same year, the election of Mr. Henry Wilson as Governor,\r\nthe cowardly assault in the United States Senate on Charles Sumner by\r\nMr. Preston Brooks, of South Carolina, in 1856--these events had\r\nindeed stirred the people of Massachusetts into revolt against the\r\nSlave Party in this Free State.\r\n\r\nBut there had come a lull.  There were still hopes that a conflict\r\nbetween North and South might be averted and that politics might do\r\nthe work of arms.  Mr. Franklin Pierce was President, but Mr. Banks\r\nhad been elected Speaker of the House of Representatives at the first\r\nsession of the Thirty-fourth Congress in December, 1855.  Mr. Blaine\r\nsaid that marked an epoch, and he described it in his brilliant {85}\r\n_Twenty Years of Congress_ as \"a distinctive victory of the Free\r\nStates over the consolidated power of the Slave States.\"\r\n\r\nBut the Republicans were slow in coming to power, and their\r\nnomination of General Frémont in 1856 sowed distrust among the\r\nsounder men of the party.  Mr. Buchanan's election seemed to confirm\r\nthe ascendency of the South, and the mind of Boston, or at any rate\r\nof State Street, reverted to commercial politics.  The Abolitionists\r\nwere as much under a cloud as ever.  From 1857 to 1860 things seemed\r\nto be going backward.  The Harper's Ferry business alarmed the\r\ningrained conservatism of Boston, and though the hanging of John\r\nBrown shocked a good many merchants and bankers, they could not\r\nunderstand, and were far from approving, Brown's scheme or Brown's\r\nmethods.  The state of feeling in Boston was, in short, confused, and\r\nthe emotions of 1854 had gone to sleep.\r\n\r\nThe crisis came in December, 1860.  The Abolitionists tried to hold\r\nan Anti-Slavery Convention in Tremont Temple, on the anniversary of\r\nthe hanging of John Brown or the day after.  They do not seem to have\r\nexpected trouble; at any rate, they took no sufficient precautions to\r\nkeep the peace and keep control of their own meeting.  A \"broadcloth\r\nmob\"--the phrase long since became classic in Boston--occupied the\r\nhall in force, captured the platform peacefully, elbowed the\r\nAbolitionists off it, appointed their own chairman, Mr. Richard S.\r\nFay, and passed {86} their own resolutions.  \"Broadcloth,\" said\r\nPhillips, \"does not make a gentleman.\"  The Convention was summoned\r\nto consider \"How shall American slavery be abolished?\"  The John\r\nBrown anniversary was thought a suitable day for the discussion of\r\nthat question, but Brown's death was referred to simply as \"too\r\nglorious to need defence or eulogy.\"  When Mr. Fay, the ringleader of\r\nthe mob, thinking his work done, had departed, Mr. Frank Sanborn, the\r\nlawful chairman, resumed his place, and would have held the lawfully\r\nsummoned meeting.  Then the mob leaders, Mr. Murray Howe now at their\r\nhead, made a fresh attack.  The police sided with them and the Mayor\r\ncleared the hall.\r\n\r\nThere is a little confusion of dates.  Brown was, in fact, hanged\r\nDecember 2nd, the fateful day of Austerlitz and of the Third\r\nNapoleon's _coup d'état_.  But these events in Boston occurred, I\r\nthink, on the 3rd.  The men who had been driven out of Tremont Temple\r\nby the mob, of which the Mayor finally took command, reassembled in\r\nthe evening, very quietly, in a little hall in Belknap Street, on\r\nwhat was impolitely known as Nigger Hill, not far from the rather\r\naristocratic Mount Vernon Street.  Wendell Phillips, to an audience\r\nof perhaps three or four hundred--all the place would hold--made an\r\nunreported speech, red-hot with wrath.  A little more than a year\r\nbefore, November 1st, 1859, a fortnight after Brown's attempt and\r\nwhile he lay in prison waiting to be hanged, Phillips had spoken in\r\n{87} Brooklyn, and announced that the lesson of the hour was\r\ninsurrection.  But he weakened the force of that counsel by adding\r\nthat the age of bullets was over; it was an insurrection of thought;\r\nlike that of the last thirty years; he still had in mind.  Now, here\r\nin Boston, and not for the first time nor for the last, he was face\r\nto face with forces which were not intellectual nor moral, but forces\r\nof violence.  Phillips could not readily shake off the influences of\r\nhis whole public life.  He still believed in \"moral suasion.\"  He was\r\npresently to learn that moralities and the counsels of peace were a\r\npoor defence against men prepared to back their opinions with\r\nrevolvers.  But even after the hanging of Brown, at his grave in\r\nNorth Elba, Phillips could say: \"I do not believe slavery will go\r\ndown in blood.  Ours is the age of thought.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the meeting of December, 1860, marks the beginning of his\r\nconversion, but by no means its completion.  He had long been used to\r\nmobs and mob law.  But now the lesson was being pressed home.\r\n\r\nA memorable evening to me, because from it came my acquaintance with\r\nPhillips, whom I had never met.  Under the spell, I suppose, of his\r\npassionate eloquence, I went home and wrote him a letter.  I\r\nexplained that I was a Whig that my family and friends were Whigs,\r\nthat I belonged in a hostile camp, but that I thought there ought to\r\nbe free speech in Boston, and I would do what I could for that cause\r\nand for him if he would say what.  I was, as most young, {88} or old,\r\nmen of Massachusetts then were, against slavery, especially in\r\nMassachusetts, but not an Abolitionist.\r\n\r\nThe next day, about noon, the door of my law office in State Street\r\nopened, and Phillips walked in.  Without a word of preface he said:\r\n\r\n\"You wrote me a letter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you come and see me at my house this evening, and we will have\r\na talk?  This morning I have not a moment.\"\r\n\r\nAgain I said yes, and the door closed and he was gone.  Often as I\r\nhad seen Phillips on the platform it seemed to me I had never seen\r\nhim till then.  A clear, strong, dry north light came in at the\r\nwindows and illuminated his face and figure.  He had the bearing of a\r\nman to whom authority and sweetness of nature belonged in like\r\ndegree.  He has been called a thousand times the Apollo of the\r\nplatform.  An Apollo he was not except in graceful dignity and\r\ndemeanour.  It his masculine beauty appeared to derive from Greece,\r\nit had become Græco-Roman, and finally borrowed its blonde colouring\r\nfrom some Scandinavian Balder.\r\n\r\nSo careless was he of mere conventionality that while he stood in the\r\ndoorway, or just inside, the soft light grey felt hat he wore, since\r\nknown as a Homburg hat, remained on his head.  When I reminded him of\r\nit long after, he said with a laugh:\r\n\r\n\"Well, you did not ask me to sit down.\"\r\n\r\n{89}\r\n\r\n\"No, you gave me no time.\"\r\n\r\nI mention it because, with his hat on and his hand on the door, his\r\nmanner and bearing were of a grave courtesy like none other.  And in\r\nthis transitory attitude, just on the wing, there was a serene\r\nleisureliness as if to hurry were unknown to him.  His eye took in\r\neverything in these ten seconds.  There was not a word beyond what I\r\nhave repeated; a purely business call to make an appointment.  But I\r\nknew when he had gone that another influence had come into my life,\r\nstronger for the time than all others.\r\n\r\nI went in the evening, as I had been bidden, to the little house in\r\nEssex Street where Phillips chose to live, as if to measure the\r\nbreadth of the gulf that he had put between himself and the world\r\ninto which he had been born; a world of easy circumstances if not\r\nwealth, and bound together by a hundred social ties nearly all of\r\nwhich he had broken.  Phillips had what at that time would be called\r\nwealth, for which he had other uses than mere expense on comfort.  A\r\nnarrow door opened into a narrow hall out of which climbed narrow\r\nstairs, with a narrow landing half-way up where the stairs turned,\r\nand at the top a still narrower passage to the door of the parlour.\r\nInside, the same impression of restricted space; a room perhaps\r\nsixteen feet by fourteen, and plainly furnished; a worn carpet on the\r\nfloor, a large shabby sofa at the end nearest the door opposite the\r\nfire-place.  Phillips was sitting on the sofa.  He rose and held out\r\nhis {90} hand: \"It's very good of you to come.  I am afraid I was\r\nabrupt this morning.\"  Then he plunged almost at once into the\r\nsituation, with a forecast of what he thought likely to happen.  \"Not\r\nmuch, if anything, till the meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society in\r\nJanuary.  That, I dare say, they will try to break up.  Lincoln has\r\nbeen elected President and Andrew Governor.  You know what I think of\r\nLincoln.  But Andrew I know well, and I do not believe mob law will\r\nbe allowed to rule while Andrew is Governor.\"  He had already\r\ndescribed Andrew in Tremont Temple: \"For the first time within my\r\nmemory we have got a man for Governor of Massachusetts, a frank,\r\ntrue, whole-souled, honest MAN.\"  Alas!  Andrew was to disappoint him\r\nbitterly in this one matter of free speech, though in no other.\r\n\r\n\"But you are to speak in another fortnight at the Music Hall,\" I\r\nsaid.  \"Do you think they will let you alone then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Phillips, \"that's on a Sunday\"; as if that would matter\r\nto men whose passions, interests, animosities, all led them to\r\nsilence the orator whom they thought, honestly enough from their\r\npoint of view, a public danger.  He asked me if I had heard anything.\r\nI had not, but when Phillips told me he was going to speak on \"Mobs\r\nand Education\" I answered, \"But that's a challenge.\"\r\n\r\n\"They can take it as they like,\" he replied, quite softly and coolly,\r\nadding: \"If you hear anything perhaps you'll let me know.\"\r\n\r\n{91}\r\n\r\nOur talk lasted late, turned on some personal matters, then drifted\r\nfar away to national issues, and much else.  I thought Phillips, if\r\nanything, more eloquent in talk than in oratory, yet with never a\r\nsentence which had in it the ring of the platform.  He was direct,\r\nsimple, persuasive, and luminous.  His frankness surprised me, but he\r\ntold me afterward he had made inquiries and thought it safe to be\r\nfrank.  No doubt he saw that mine was a sincere devotion, and perhaps\r\nhe was aware of the enchantments he wove about whom he would.  At any\r\nrate, he gave me his confidence from the start.\r\n\r\nDuring the next fortnight I saw many men among my Whig acquaintances.\r\nThey made no secret of their purpose to break up that Sunday meeting\r\nat the Music Hall.  Soon these rumours became public.  When the\r\nsubject of Phillips's discourse was announced, the rumours spread and\r\ngrew more menacing.  The police felt themselves called on to take\r\nnotice of what was likely to happen.  Phillips, long used to dealing\r\nwith mobs, seemed to think the police superfluous.  Some of us who\r\nhad looked into the matter well knew they were not.  Seeing Phillips\r\nfrom day to day, I asked him again and again to promise his friends\r\none thing, viz. that he would put himself and leave himself in their\r\nhands.  He still thought we were making too much of a slight danger,\r\nbut finally he promised.  There had been mobs in Boston before this,\r\nwhere the police and the mob had acted together.  They so acted {92}\r\nwhen Richard S. Fay and Amos Lawrence, and Murray Howe and their\r\nfriends broke up the Anti-Slavery Convention in Tremont Temple on the\r\nmorning of December 3rd--this same month.  And it was that mob from\r\nwhich Phillips was to take his text on this Sunday.  A piquant\r\nsituation, if it had not been something much more serious, with all\r\nthe materials of a great tragedy.\r\n\r\nThis time the mob leaders, whoever they were, had changed their\r\ntactics.  They did not propose to capture the Music Hall or prevent\r\nPhillips from speaking.  He was to be dealt with outside.  None the\r\nless did the police and Phillips's friends, unaware of details, take\r\nmeasures to guard the interior.  The police were in force in the\r\nlobbies and passages and at the exterior approaches to the platform;\r\nbut out of sight.  Scores of them were in the building, and a much\r\nlarger force in waiting hard by.  The platform, which ran from one\r\nside of the hall to the other at the south end, was garrisoned by\r\nPhillips's friends, armed.  The enemy also were armed, and no man\r\ncould say what that Sabbath morning might bring forth.  Naturally, we\r\ndid not know of the decision of the mob leaders, all in broadcloth,\r\nto postpone their assault till the meeting was over.  We expected\r\ntrouble inside, and were ready for it.  I said as little as possible\r\nto Phillips of what I thought likely to happen.  I well knew that if\r\nhe were told there was any peril in freedom of speech, his speech\r\nwould be freer than ever.\r\n\r\n{93}\r\n\r\nHe always believed in personalities, saying:\r\n\r\n\"In such a cause as ours you must at all hazards rouse attention.\r\nMen whose minds are made up against you will listen to a personal\r\nattack when they will listen to nothing else.  If I denounce the sin\r\nthey go to sleep, but when I denounce the sinner they wake up.\"\r\n\r\nThere was to be no going to sleep on this eventful Sunday.  The\r\nspeech on \"Mobs and Education\" is perhaps the most personal, and the\r\nmost merciless, of all Phillips's speeches.  The Tremont Temple\r\nrioters had delivered themselves into his hands.  He knew every man\r\namong them and the joint in every armour.  Many of them were there on\r\nSunday.  You saw the arrow leave the platform and sink deep in the\r\nquivering flesh.  The cheers were soon mingled with hisses.  The air\r\ngrew hot.  But the majority were there to hear and the hisses were\r\nsilenced.  There were passes of burning eloquence, of pathos, of\r\ninvective that tore its way through all defences.\r\n\r\n\"I have used strong words.  But I was born in Boston, and the good\r\nname of the old town is bound up with every fibre of my heart.  I\r\ndare not trust myself to describe the insolence of men who undertake\r\nto dictate to you and me what we shall say in these grand old\r\nstreets.\"\r\n\r\nThus spoke the aristocrat, the Bostonian proud of Boston and of his\r\nown descent from six or seven generations of the Boston Phillipses;\r\nan aristocracy equal to the best.  His contempt for the Fays and the\r\nrest of the \"cotton clerks\" was {94} largely a contempt for the\r\nplebeian.  Plebeians, to the Boston mind, most of them were.  Fay is\r\npilloried for ever in this speech; and others are pilloried.\r\n\r\nI will quote one passage, not from Phillips, but a passage from\r\nEdward Everett on free speech which Phillips himself quoted toward\r\nthe end of his discourse.  I quote it because Phillips used often to\r\nsay that American oratory had few finer examples to show:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I seem to hear a voice from the tombs of departing ages, from the\r\n    sepulchres of nations that died before the sight.  They exhort\r\n    us, they adjure us, to be faithful to our trust.  They implore\r\n    us, by the long trials of struggling humanity, by the awful\r\n    secrets of the prison house where the sons of Freedom have been\r\n    immured, by the noble heads which have been brought to the block,\r\n    by the eloquent ruins of nations, they conjure us not to quench\r\n    the light that is rising on the world.  Greece cries to us by the\r\n    convulsed lips of her poisoned, dying Demosthenes, and Rome\r\n    pleads with us in the mute persuasion of her mangled Tully.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not often that a great orator opens his heart to us about the\r\nmerits of a rival, or whispers to us any one of the secrets of his\r\nown or another's eloquence.  I cannot remember whether Phillips ever\r\npaid to Everett in public the tribute I have often known him pay in\r\nprivate.  If he had lived in an age when issues were less vital, or\r\nless deadly, he might have found in Everett a model.  But Everett has\r\nno passion, and passion is an element in almost all Phillips's\r\nspeeches.  And passion, of quite another kind, fierce, vindictive,\r\nmurderous, he was to meet in another ten minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{95}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS AND THE BOSTON MOBS\r\n\r\nPhillips's speech had been all through one to stir deep resentment.\r\nThe atmosphere of the Music Hall was seething with fierce passion,\r\nand it seemed likely enough there would be a rush for the platform\r\nwhen he had finished.  If it had come it would have been met.  The\r\nlittle band of armed men who concerned themselves about his safety\r\nnever left his side.  But there was no rush.  The plans of the enemy\r\nwere of a different kind.  The audience passed quietly out of the\r\nhall.  A police officer came to tell us that there would be trouble\r\noutside.  A mob--of course a broadcloth mob--had assembled.  What the\r\nmob intended only the leaders of it knew, but he assured us that the\r\npolice were strong enough to deal with it.  But he said Mr.\r\nPhillips's friends should go with him when he left the hall, and keep\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nThere were, I think, not more than half a dozen of us who were\r\narmed--Le Barnes, Hinton, Redpath, Charles Pollen, and one or two\r\nothers.  We told Phillips what he was likely to meet, and that we\r\nshould walk next to him.  When we got to the outer door we found the\r\npolice disputing with {96} the mob the narrow passage, perhaps fifty\r\nyards long, from the hall to Winter Street.  It was slow work\r\nthrusting these disturbers out, because Winter Street was crowded\r\nwith the main body of rioters, and there was no room for more.  But\r\nthe police knew their business, and meant to do it, and did it.\r\nInside the passage there was not space enough for an effective\r\nattack, even had not the police been too strong.  But it took us, I\r\njudge, some fifteen minutes to make our way from the hall door to the\r\nstreet.\r\n\r\nDuring this space of time the mob in Winter Street roared at us.\r\nThey seemed to think we were afraid to go on, and they flung at\r\nPhillips such insults as hatred and anger supplied them with--coward,\r\ntraitor, and so on: with threats besides.  Phillips met it all with a\r\nsmiling face.  His hand was on my arm, so that if there had been any\r\nnervousness I should have been aware of it.  But the pressure of the\r\nhand was firm and steady.  He was as cool--to use Mr. Rufus Choate's\r\nsimilitude--as a couple of summer mornings.  The police who had been\r\na rear-guard, satisfied they were not needed there, had gone to the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\nAt first the mob gave little heed to the police.  They expected the\r\npolice, as in Tremont Temple, December 3rd, to be on their side.  But\r\nthis time an officer had command who knew only his duty as policeman.\r\nNo politics but to keep the peace and protect peaceful citizens.  The\r\nofficer was Deputy Chief Ham.  I have since seen a great deal of\r\npolice work in many parts of the world; {97} in New York, London,\r\nParis, Berlin, and elsewhere; nowhere any better handling of a\r\ndangerous mob than this by Deputy Chief Ham.  His force was none too\r\nlarge, but his mastery over the mob was never in doubt.  In their\r\nhand-to-hand struggles in the little passageway the police showed\r\nwhat they were made of.  Of Phillips's friends the number had\r\nincreased as we passed from the platform, but if we had been alone we\r\nshould have been swallowed up, or we should have been driven almost\r\nat once to use our revolvers.  But the police were an impregnable\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nOnce out in Winter Street, they formed in a solid square, Phillips\r\nand his friends in the centre.  The square was never broken.  The mob\r\nwere many thousands strong.  There were wild rushes, there was the\r\ntremendous pressure of great masses of men, but against it all the\r\npolice held good.  Down Winter Street to Washington Street, along\r\nWashington Street to Essex Street, and in Essex Street to the door of\r\nPhillips's house, the mob kept us company, oozing and surging slowly\r\non, reviling and cursing all the way.  They thought they would have a\r\nchance at the house, but the Deputy Chief had taken possession there\r\nin advance, and when the door opened we passed comfortably in between\r\nthe police lines.  It had taken us an hour or more from the hall to\r\nthe house.  The distance is a short half-mile.\r\n\r\nIt had been a murderous mob.  Phillips's life was aimed at and had\r\nbeen in imminent danger during that hour.  The spirit of murder was\r\n{98} abroad.  The police warned us.  They thought the peril over for\r\nthe moment, but none the less remained on duty near the house.  Men\r\nwere stopped and asked to state their business.  When I returned in\r\nthe afternoon an officer came up to me but recognized me, nodded, and\r\nI went in.  I found Phillips as cool as usual, the usual sunshine in\r\nhis blue eyes.  I told him what I had heard from the police, and that\r\nI thought his house ought to be garrisoned for the night.\r\n\r\n\"But who will undertake that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your friends know there is danger and will gladly come.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed a little sceptical and asked:\r\n\r\n\"Will you come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly.\"  I explained to him our plans.  He went into the back\r\nparlour and brought out an ugly-looking pike.  \"It was John Brown's,\"\r\nhe said.  No weapon could be more unfit for use in a narrow hall or\r\non winding stairs.  It might have a moral effect.  It was agreed that\r\nthree of us whose names are above, should camp out that night in the\r\nparlour.  When we arrived about ten o'clock we found the table laid,\r\nwith food and drink for a much larger army.  The night passed without\r\nalarm, as did following nights, but neither our vigilance nor that of\r\nthe police relaxed.\r\n\r\nDuring these days, and long after, Phillips walked the streets of\r\nBoston with his hand on his revolver.  I was sometimes with him.  I\r\nsaid one day:\r\n\r\n{99}\r\n\r\n\"I am more afraid now they will try insult than injury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't trouble about that.  I can see over my shoulder, and before a\r\nman can touch me I shall shoot.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a quick and good shot, as I found out next summer, when I used\r\nto stay with him in Milton, and we practised at a target.\r\n\r\nBut the memorable 21st of January drew on, when the annual meeting of\r\nthe Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society was to be held in Tremont\r\nTemple.  Rumours again filled the air, and something more than\r\nrumours.  I have already said I had friends in the other camp.  One\r\nof them came to me to beg me to let it alone.  \"I care nothing about\r\nPhillips,\" he said, \"but you are my friend and I must tell you what I\r\nknow, though I am betraying my own party.\"  \"Then don't tell it.\"\r\nBut he insisted.\r\n\r\nHis story came to this: That, knowing we had organized in December\r\nfor defence, they had organized for attack.  A group of men\r\noutnumbering ours would go to the Temple on the 21st, well led and\r\nwell armed.  Under the new Mayor, Wightman, a more subservient tool\r\nof the mob than his predecessor, Lincoln, the police would no longer\r\nbe allowed to protect the Abolitionists.  This hostile band would\r\nwait on events a little, but if Phillips and his friends were in the\r\nsame mood as at the Music Hall, they would be driven out of the\r\nTemple.  \"What do you mean by driven out?\"  He answered, gravely, \"It\r\nwould be truer to say {100} carried out.  We are determined to put\r\ndown this mad agitation.  They will not leave the Temple alive.\"\r\n\r\nMy friend spoke in perfect good faith, but it is needless to say I\r\ndid not believe him.  I told him so.\r\n\r\n\"Your friends talk, but they will not act.  They well know that if\r\nthey murder Phillips they will be hanged for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will you not advise Phillips to stay away, or at least to be\r\nmoderate?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I will not.  If I did, it would be useless.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if you tell him what I say?\"\r\n\r\n\"He would disbelieve it, as I do.\"\r\n\r\nOur talk ended.  I thanked him, but said his friends would find us\r\nready; that I should, of course, consider what he had said\r\nconfidential, but it would not alter our purpose.  He wished me to\r\ntell Phillips, mentioning no names, and I might tell any of our party\r\nwho could be trusted.  Evidently he hoped they would be more\r\nimpressed than I was.  I did tell Phillips, who said, \"You seem to\r\nhave queer friends.\"  I said something also to the two men who were\r\nto be stationed at the ends of the platform where the steps were,\r\nleading to the platform from the body of the hall, the two most\r\ndangerous points.  The only change they made in their plans was to\r\ndouble the number of these outposts.\r\n\r\nFrom morning, when the Convention assembled till the noon recess, and\r\nthen all through the afternoon the Temple was a scene of confusion,\r\ndisorder, {101} uproar; rioting even, but of no violence.  The deep\r\ngallery opposite the platform was thronged by the rioters.  The\r\nformal business of organization once over, they broke in upon every\r\nspeech.  Nobody was heard.  Phillips, with all his tact in dealing\r\nwith such gangs, could do little.  Now and then a sentence rang\r\nclear.  A message had gone from the Temple to the State House, where\r\nGovernor Andrew sat waiting, and watching the course of events.  An\r\nanswer had come back by word of mouth, and had been misunderstood, as\r\noral messages commonly are.\r\n\r\nIn a lull, Phillips's voice was heard in a direct appeal to the\r\ngallery mob: \"We have a message from the Governor.  The State Militia\r\nis on its way to the Temple and will sweep that rabble where it\r\nbelongs--into the calaboose.\"  The rabble thought it over for a while\r\nin silence, but began again.  When the adjournment came Phillips said\r\nto me: \"I am going to Governor Andrew.  Come.\"\r\n\r\nWe found Governor Andrew in his room at the golden-domed State House\r\nof Massachusetts.  He greeted us cordially and listened while\r\nPhillips stated his case.  Phillips urged that the Anti-Slavery\r\nSociety had a right to meet, a right to transact business, a right to\r\nthe free use of that free speech which was a right attaching to\r\ncitizenship in Massachusetts; and a right to be protected when that\r\nright was denied.  Primarily, he said, it was the business of the\r\npolice to keep order and give protection, but the police, acting\r\nunder the {102} orders of Mayor Wightman, refused to do their plain\r\nduty.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore,\" said Phillips, \"I come to the Governor of the State to\r\nsafeguard citizens of the State in the exercise of their rights.\"\r\n\r\nSaid Governor Andrew:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Phillips, what do you wish me to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Send a sufficient force of troops to Tremont Temple to put down the\r\nrioters and protect law-abiding citizens in the legal exercise of\r\ntheir legal rights.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor sat behind a table on which lay a copy of the Revised\r\nStatutes of Massachusetts.  He opened it, handed it to us, and said:\r\n\r\n\"If you wish me, as Governor, to act, show me the statute which gives\r\nme the power.\"\r\n\r\nBut Phillips was not to be turned aside.  He answered, in tones\r\nslightly less cool than before:\r\n\r\n\"Free speech is a common law right.  The power to which I appeal is a\r\ncommon law power, inherent in the Governor as the Chief Magistrate of\r\nthe State.\"\r\n\r\nBut Andrew said again:\r\n\r\n\"Show me the statute.\"\r\n\r\nAnd again:\r\n\r\n\"Show me the statute.\"\r\n\r\nAnd from that he was not to be moved.  Seeing that his mind was made\r\nup, Phillips turned away abruptly, saying to me, \"Come,\" and we\r\ndeparted.  As we went downstairs Phillips said:\r\n\r\n\"I will never again speak to Andrew as long as I live.\"\r\n\r\n{103}\r\n\r\nAnd we went back to the Temple, knowing at last we had nothing to\r\ndepend on but ourselves and our revolvers.\r\n\r\nAgain during the interval my friend came to me.  He said: \"You will\r\nbe allowed to hold your meeting this afternoon, though not without\r\ninterruption.  But the attack I have warned you of will be made this\r\nevening, and I once more beseech you to stay away.\"  He knew, of\r\ncourse, it was impossible.  What took place after that in the\r\ncouncils of the rioters I know not.  I have always supposed that my\r\nfriend, a man well known in Boston, went to the Mayor and laid the\r\ncase before him.  I do not know.  What is known is that before the\r\nhour when the Society was to assemble in the evening, the Mayor\r\nclosed the Temple.  His decision was not imparted to us.  Phillips\r\nand I drove to the Temple, and only on arriving heard what the Mayor\r\nhad done.  He was a weak Mayor, disloyal, incompetent.  But he had\r\nperhaps prevented a tragedy.  I think Governor Andrew, aware of the\r\nprobable course of events in the South and at Washington, desired to\r\navoid anything like a conflict in Massachusetts.  He said as much to\r\nme afterward.  That was his excuse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{104}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWENDELL PHILLIPS--GOVERNOR ANDREW--PHILLIPS'S CONVERSION\r\n\r\nThere was one clear reason for the deadly hatred of the pro-slavery\r\nfaction in Boston to Phillips.  He was the real leader of the\r\nAnti-Slavery Party.  If he could be silenced, the voices of the rest\r\nmattered little.  During twenty years Garrison's influence had been\r\ndeclining, and Phillips had come steadily to the front.  For the last\r\nten years he had stood alone.  It was his voice which rang through\r\nthe land.  His were the counsels which governed the Abolitionist\r\nband.  His speeches were something more than eloquent; they were full\r\nof knowledge, of hard thinking; and the rhetorical splendour only\r\nlighted up a closely reasoned argument.  What Emerson said of\r\nspeeches and writings in general was absolutely true of Phillips's\r\noratory; the effect of it was mathematically measurable by the depth\r\nof thought.  He spoke all over the North.  The Conservatives had no\r\nmatch for him; therefore he was to be put down by other means.\r\n\r\nPassions ran, I think, higher in Boston during those winter months of\r\n1860-1, and the early {105} spring, than before or since.  Thanks to\r\nthe pro-slavery faction on one side and the Abolitionists on the\r\nother, Massachusetts was within measurable distance of civil war\r\nwithin her own borders.  After Fort Sumter and Baltimore, these\r\npassions found an outlet elsewhere.  For a time, the two Northern\r\nfactions merged into one people.  But during all the years that have\r\npassed since I have known nothing quite like the state of feeling\r\nwhich prevailed that winter.  The solid men of Boston thought they\r\nsaw the fabric of society dissolving and their business and wealth\r\nand authority perishing with it.  The solid world was to exist no\r\nmore.  Naturally, they fought for their lives and all the rest of it,\r\nand fought hard.  Their hatreds were savage.  Their methods were\r\nsavage.  We seemed to be getting back to the primitive days when men\r\nstood face to face, and the issue of battle became a personal combat.\r\nThe Lawrences and their friends were generally a little stout for the\r\nbusiness of battle, but the allies whom they brought with them to\r\nTremont Temple and the Music Hall and the streets were good fighting\r\nmaterial.  During all this time the Abolitionists were, as they had\r\nbeen, a minority and on the defensive.\r\n\r\nBut this was the state of things which Governor Andrew had in mind\r\nwhen he challenged Phillips to show him the statute.  He did not want\r\nto make the State of Massachusetts a party to this conflict within\r\nitself.  If to keep order in the streets or to keep a platform open\r\nto Phillips he were obliged to move, he meant to have the law {106}\r\nwith him.  No refinements, no Judge-made law, no generalizations--for\r\nthe common law after an Atlantic voyage and a hundred years' sleep is\r\nnothing--but a statute, printed, legible, peremptory, binding alike\r\nupon Governor and citizens.  There was no such statute.  If anybody\r\nhad happened to think of it, no doubt there would have been, but\r\nthere was not.\r\n\r\nTherefore the Governor sat still.  He was of such a bulk that it\r\nseemed as if, while he sat still, nothing could move.  He was, in\r\nsize and build, not wholly unlike Gambetta, though he had two eyes,\r\nboth blue, as against the one black, fiery orb of the Genoese; and\r\ncurling light brown hair instead of the black lion's mane which\r\nfloated to Gambetta's shoulders; and a face in which sweetness\r\ncounted for as much as strength.  Like Gambetta, he was well served\r\nby those about him.  He knew accurately what was going on, and all\r\nthat was going on.  He told me afterward he did not know on what\r\ninformation we acted, but he was astonished we knew so much about\r\nwhat the enemy intended.  When I reminded him that my associations\r\nwere mostly with the other side, he reflected a moment and said:\r\n\"Yes, that explains a good deal.\"  I did not think it necessary to\r\nadd that, after Tremont Temple, we were on good terms with the police\r\nalso; since Phillips's appeal to Andrew had been based on the\r\nalliance between the police and the Lawrence mob; an alliance which\r\nhad in truth existed, at that time.\r\n\r\nBut the winter wore on.  Twice after the {107} discourse on Mobs and\r\nEducation, Phillips spoke in the Music Hall--January 20th, 1861, on\r\nDisunion, and February 17th, on Progress.  Both times the mob\r\nsupplied part of his audience inside and part of his escort outside.\r\nNo violence was attempted.  The police were too strong, and the\r\nexample of Deputy Chief Ham had proved they were in earnest.  If\r\nthere was any violence, it was in Phillips's speeches and language.\r\nHe was never more provocative.  His forecast of the situation was\r\ninfluenced by his wishes and theories.  All his life he had been\r\npreaching disunion as the one remedy for the slave.  Disunion seemed\r\nnow at last within reach, and at all costs he would do what he could\r\nto promote it.  Indeed, he thought it already accomplished.  Within\r\nsix weeks after Lincoln's election South Carolina had replied by an\r\nordinance of secession.  Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia had followed,\r\nand all over the South United States forts and arsenals had been\r\nseized by State troops.  What was Phillips's comment?\r\n\r\n\"The Lord reigneth; let the earth rejoice.  The covenant with death\r\nis annulled; the agreement with hell is broken in pieces.  The chain\r\nwhich has held the slave system since 1787 is parted.\"\r\n\r\nHe pronounced a eulogy on the Southern State which had led the way:\r\n\r\n\"South Carolina, bankrupt, alone, with a hundred thousand more slaves\r\nthan whites, four blacks to three whites within her borders, flings\r\nher gauntlet at the feet of twenty-four millions of people--in\r\ndefence of an idea.\"\r\n\r\n{108}\r\n\r\nA month later he was in the same mood.  It was a trait of\r\nPhillips--not a good one--that he attacked most mercilessly the men\r\nwho hated slavery as much as he did, but could not go as far as he\r\ndid.  In this February speech there is a long lampoon on Dana;\r\ncounsel for the slave in all the fugitive slave cases, but never\r\ndenying--what lawyer ever did deny?--that there was a constitutional\r\nobligation to return fugitives.  It is human nature, but not the best\r\nside of it.\r\n\r\nSuch a reproach came ill from a man who denounced the Constitution as\r\na covenant with death because of the compromises with slavery\r\nimbedded in the great instrument of 1787.  Of these compromises the\r\nrendition of fugitive slaves was one.  Phillips himself could not\r\ndeny it.  The difference between him and Dana was that Dana would bow\r\nto the law and Phillips would not.  Dana would do what he could by\r\nlegal means to rescue the fugitive.  He defended him in the courts.\r\nPhillips would have defended him in the streets.  Both men were\r\nneedful to the time.  The Abolitionists were very far from disdaining\r\nthe use of legal weapons.  When Theodore Parker had been indicted and\r\nthe Court, at the instance of his counsel, quashed the indictment on\r\npurely technical grounds, Parker exulted.  \"It is a triumph for the\r\nright.  We have broken their sword.\"\r\n\r\nThere came, however, the moment when Phillips had to cast in his lot,\r\nfor good or evil, with either North or South.  He hesitated long.  He\r\nthought and thought.  He talked with his friends, with the {109} man\r\nin the street, with the men who had lately mobbed him.  One morning\r\nhe came into my office.  His sunny face was clouded.  He looked\r\nanxious, almost ill.  He had to make the most momentous decision of\r\nhis life; and he could not yet make up his mind.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"I came to talk to you because I know you are against me.  What I\r\nhave said to you before makes no impression.  You still think I ought\r\nto renounce my past, thirty years of it, belie my pledges, disown\r\nevery profession of faith, bless those whom I have cursed, start\r\nafresh with a new set of political principles, and admit my life has\r\nbeen a mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not the last,\" I said, \"and as for the others, are you not\r\ntaking a rhetorical view, a platform view?  But I will go further.  I\r\ndon't think it matters much what you sacrifice--consistency,\r\nprinciples, or anything.  They belong to the past.  They have nothing\r\nto do with to-day.  The war is upon us.  You must either support it\r\nor oppose it.  If you oppose it, you fling away your position and all\r\nyour influence.  You will never be listened to again.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on.  He sat silent, unmoved.  Nothing I could say, nothing\r\nanybody could say, would move him.  All his life long he had thought\r\nfor himself; in a minority of one.  It had to be so now.  We talked\r\non.  Finally, I said: \"I will tell you what I once heard a negro say:\r\n'When my massa and somebody else quarrel I'm on the somebody else's\r\nside.'  Don't you think the negro knows?  Do you really doubt that a\r\nwar between {110} the Slave Power and the North, be the result what\r\nit may, must end in Freedom?\"  I am not sure that I ever did hear a\r\nnegro say that, but I hoped that Phillips would open his mind to the\r\nnegro if not to me.  And I think he did.  I trust this little\r\nartifice of debate was not very wrong.  I had to urge what I could,\r\nbut I knew Phillips would decide for himself.  He left saying, \"I\r\nwill see you again to-night.\"  I went to his house.  When I opened\r\nthe door of the parlour, there lay Phillips on the sofa, asleep.  Ten\r\nminutes later he awoke; lay silent for another minute, then said:\r\n\r\n\"We shall not have to discuss these things any more.  I am going to\r\nspeak next Sunday at the Music Hall for the War and the Union.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he began at once to consider how he should announce his\r\nconversion.  Having gone over, he took his whole heart with him.  No\r\ncompromise, no transition, not one word to retract, not a hint of\r\napology or explanation.  Yesterday an Abolitionist to whom the\r\nConstitution was a covenant with death and an agreement with hell.\r\nTo-day a soldier for the Union.  Presently he said:\r\n\r\n\"It will be the most important speech of my life.  I don't often\r\nwrite, as you know, but I shall write this and will read it to you\r\nwhen it is finished.\"\r\n\r\nTwo days later he sent for me again and these were the first\r\nsentences I heard:\r\n\r\n\"Many times this winter, here and elsewhere, I have counselled\r\npeace--urged as well as I knew how the expediency of acknowledging a\r\nSouthern Confederacy and the peaceful separation of these {111}\r\nthirty-four States.  One of the journals announces to you that I come\r\nhere this morning to retract those opinions.  No not one of them.\"\r\n\r\nI said: \"Mr. Phillips, you will never get beyond that.  They will not\r\nlisten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then they will be the last sentences I shall ever utter in public.\r\nBut do you listen.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he went on, in his finest platform manner and voice:\r\n\r\n\"No, not one of them.  I need them all; every word I have spoken this\r\nwinter; every act of twenty-five years of my life, to make the\r\nwelcome I give this War hearty and hot.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew what he was about.  When it became known he was to speak for\r\nthe Union, Charles Pollen came to me and asked whether I thought\r\nPhillips would like the Music Hall platform hung with the American\r\nflag.  \"Yes,\" said Phillips, \"deck the altar for the victim.\"  And\r\ndecked it was--a forest of flags; and the flags told the story, long\r\nbefore Phillips opened his mouth.  There was not a note of\r\nremonstrance as he announced his refusal to retract.  And again he\r\nwent on:\r\n\r\n\"Civil war is a momentous evil.  It needs the soundest, most solemn\r\njustification.  I rejoice before God to-day for every word I have\r\nspoken counselling peace, but I rejoice also, and still more deeply,\r\nthat now, for the first time in my Anti-Slavery life, I speak beneath\r\nthe Stars and Stripes, and welcome the tread of Massachusetts men\r\nmarshalled for war.\"\r\n\r\nI never saw such a scene.  The audience sprang {112} up and cheered\r\nand cheered and cheered.  The hall was a furnace seven times heated.\r\nThe only unmoved man was Phillips.  He waited and once more went on:\r\n\r\n\"No matter what the past has been or said, to-day the slave asks God\r\nfor a sight of this banner and counts it the pledge of his\r\nredemption.  Hitherto it may have meant what you thought or what I\r\nthought: to-day it represents sovereignty and justice.  Massachusetts\r\nhas been sleeping on her arms since '83.  The first cannon shot\r\nbrings her to her feet with the war-cry of the Revolution on her\r\nlips.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on to the end.  It was a nobler speech even than in the\r\nprinted report, for that came from his manuscript and often he put\r\nhis manuscript aside and let himself go.  The inspiration of the\r\nmoment was more than any written words.  When it was over there was\r\nagain a mob outside; a mob that would have carried the orator\r\nshoulder-high to Essex Street.  The honest, strong face of the Deputy\r\nChief of Police wore a broad smile.  He had done his duty.  His\r\nresponsibilities were ended.  He, too, had fought his fight.\r\nPhillips took it all coolly.  It was such a triumph as comes to a man\r\nonce in his career, and once only--the finest hour in Phillips's\r\nlife.  He never reached a greater height of oratory, nor an equal\r\nheight of devotion.  For his triumph was over himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{113}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nWILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON--A CRITICAL VIEW\r\n\r\nIn explaining why Wendell Phillips was the target for every shot in\r\nthe winter of 1860-1, I said it was because he was the real leader of\r\nthe anti-slavery party during all the later and more critical years\r\nof the long struggle for freedom.  No doubt, Garrison at one time\r\nheld the first place among the Abolitionists.  He was the first of\r\nthem in time, or one of the first.  He had had the good fortune to be\r\nmobbed and led through the streets of Boston with a rope about his\r\nbody.  He had founded a weekly paper, _The Liberator_.  Georgia had\r\noffered five thousand dollars reward for his arrest.  He had\r\nunflinching courage and needed it all in the 'thirties and later.\r\nBut he had very moderate abilities.  His force was a moral force.  He\r\nhad convictions and would go any length rather than surrender any one\r\nof them.  But he had almost no other of those gifts and capacities\r\nwhich make a leader.  He had no organizing power.  He was not a good\r\nwriter.  He was not a good speaker.  He could not hold an audience.\r\nHe could not keep the attention of the public which he had won in the\r\nbeginning.  He did not attract to the {114} Abolitionist ranks the\r\nablest of the men who were ready to make a fight against slavery.\r\nThey did not care to serve under Garrison; under a leader who could\r\nnot lead.  They went into politics.\r\n\r\nSo it happened that the Abolitionists had become a dwindling force.\r\nIf Phillips had not appeared on the scene, with his wonderful\r\noratory, his natural authority on the platform and off, his brilliant\r\nlove of battle, his temperament, at once commanding and sympathetic,\r\nhis persuasive charm--the Abolitionists would have been wellnigh\r\nforgotten.  He had all the moral force of Garrison, and the\r\nintellectual force which Garrison had not.\r\n\r\nPhillips himself would never allow this to be said if he could help\r\nit.  He recognized Garrison as leader, and was perfectly loyal to\r\nhim.  So far as he could, he imposed his own view on the public.  It\r\nwas so abroad as well as at home.  When Garrison came to London a\r\nmeeting was held in St. James's Hall in his honour.  Mr. Bright spoke\r\nand others spoke, hailing the worn-out champion as the herald of\r\nAmerican Emancipation, which perhaps he was.  Boston, which has\r\nperiods of generous penitence, gave him thirty thousand dollars,\r\nothers than Bostonians paying part of the money, and accepted a\r\nbronze statue and put it up--I forget where.  It has ever since been\r\nthe fashion to recognize Garrison as the moral educator of the North\r\non the slavery question; the schoolmaster of his period.  Very\r\npossibly my liking for Phillips warped my opinion at the time.  But\r\nnow, after all these years, I think myself {115} impartial.  I had a\r\nknowledge of the situation.  If it is a wrong view, why was Phillips\r\nand not Garrison the shining mark at which the pro-slavery people\r\naimed in those critical years from 1854 to 1861?  No other theory\r\nwill explain that.\r\n\r\nWhen I used to express an impatient opinion of Garrison, and of\r\nPhillips's submission to him, I was rebuked for it.  Said Phillips:\r\n\r\n\"You are unjust and you do not know the facts, or you do not make\r\nallowance for them.  Like other young men, you are of to-day.\r\nGarrison's work had been done before you were old enough to know\r\nanything about it, and he is for all time.  I don't say there would\r\nhave been no Abolitionist movement but for Garrison, since Abolition\r\nwas in the air, and the anti-slavery fight had to be fought.  It\r\nwould have been fought in a different way without him, and perhaps\r\nlater.  You underrate the moral forces and Garrison's capacity as a\r\nleader.  He was a leader, and is.  Intellectual gifts do not make a\r\nleader.  The soldier whom other soldiers follow into the breach, and\r\nto death, need not be a great captain, nor understand the art of war.\r\nWhat he understands is the art of getting himself killed, and of\r\ninducing the men behind him to do the same.  Garrison took his life\r\nin his hand.  For many years he was leader of a forlorn hope.  He\r\nheld extreme views.  He had to hold them.  He drove men away from the\r\nAbolitionist camp.  They were better elsewhere.  He was not a\r\npolitician, but politics were not what we wanted, nor what the cause\r\nwanted.  {116} What it wanted was inspiration, and that is what it\r\ngot from Garrison.\"\r\n\r\nI have put this in quotation marks, but I do not mean that Phillips\r\nsaid it all at once, nor perhaps in these words.  But the passage\r\nreproduces as accurately as I can the substance of what I have heard\r\nhim say in many talks about Garrison.  I do not expect anybody to\r\naccept my view against Phillips's.  But I must give my own, right or\r\nwrong.  I saw something of Garrison, publicly and privately.  I had\r\nno dislike for him, but neither had I any enthusiasm.  As I recall\r\nthe impressions of those days, it seems to me that I have never known\r\na man of so much renown as Garrison with so slight an equipment for\r\nthe business of leadership, or even of apostleship.  When I try to\r\nsum him up, I am embarrassed by the want of material.  After all,\r\nwhat did he say or do?\r\n\r\nBorrowing from Isaiah a phrase of condensed passion, Garrison had\r\ncalled the Constitution a covenant with death and an agreement with\r\nhell.  Without Isaiah's help, he produced the only other phrase\r\nwhich, out of all his writings and speakings has kept a place in the\r\ngeneral memory: \"I will not equivocate; I will not excuse; I will not\r\nretreat a single inch, and I will be heard.\"  That was his pledge in\r\nthe first number of _The Liberator_.  It was finely said, and well he\r\nkept it; so long as it mattered what he kept.  I have often heard him\r\nspeak.  I cannot recall one single effort of anything that could be\r\nthought oratory.  He was a tiresome speaker.  Of rhetoric, or of that\r\nart {117} which goes to the making of good speeches, he had no trace\r\nor tinge.  Between him and his audiences there was no give and take.\r\nHe just stood up on the platform and hammered away.\r\n\r\nHe was a fanatic, pure and simple.  He had a message to deliver, and\r\nhe delivered it as a gramophone delivers its messages.  He was what\r\nthey call a record.  If he impressed his hearers, as he sometimes\r\ndid, it was by the passionate fervour of his beliefs, and of his\r\nanimosities.  He was at white heat.  More often he wearied them.\r\nThey got up and went away.  I suppose people read _The Liberator_.\r\nDr. Johnson said you could write anything if you set yourself to it\r\ndoggedly, and so it is of reading.  But the average reader feels\r\nhimself entitled to a little help from the writer, and from Garrison\r\nhe got none.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was in the early days of journalism--it was ten years\r\nbefore Horace Greeley founded _The New York Tribune_ that _The\r\nLiberator_ was born.  A newspaper was then a newspaper, whether it\r\nhad any news or not; and even when its editorials were written, as\r\nthe elder Bennett said _The New York Herald_ editorials were written,\r\nfor men who could not read.  The printed page had an authority\r\nbecause it was printed; an authority which hardly survived Prince\r\nBismarck's epigram on the newspaper: \"Just printer's ink on paper.\"\r\n_The Liberator_ was violent, bitter, prolix, and dull.  But the\r\nPuritan preachers were all this, yet men sat contentedly for hours\r\nbeneath their intolerable outpourings, as do the Scotch to this day.\r\nCarlyle {118} had heard Irving preach for hours on end.  I have\r\nsometimes had to sit under the Scottish preachers, when staying at a\r\nhighly ecclesiastical house.  On these occasions I used to dream that\r\nI was reading _The Liberator_ or listening to Garrison in the Boston\r\nMelodeon.  The a priori method was common to both, and the absence of\r\naccurate knowledge.  They did not master their subjects, nor their\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\nAs to what Garrison did, I am quite willing to accept the history of\r\nhis time as it is commonly told.  I take all that for granted; all\r\nhis services to the anti-slavery cause; and, with all drawbacks, they\r\nwere great.  Still, I do not think they explain his immense fame.  He\r\nwas a Captain in the army of the Lord, if you like, but a Captain who\r\nwon no battles.  There was one final victory, based on a long series\r\nof defeats; a victory in which he had a share, though not a great\r\nshare.  Perhaps a better Saint than Captain, but in Rome's long\r\ncatalogue of the canonized how many first-rate names are there?  You\r\ncan become a saint quite cheaply if you know how.  There are fifty or\r\nmore huge volumes of the _Acta Sanctorum_, mostly lies, yet extremely\r\ninteresting as examples of the use to which the human imagination can\r\nbe put for ecclesiastical purposes.  A Benedictine labour, ere yet\r\nscience had shaken the foundations of clerical fairy tales by its\r\ndemand for evidence.  The acutest minds accepted them.  So late as\r\nthe nineteenth century they were still accepted.  After his\r\n\"conversion,\" Newman, perhaps the {119} finest mind of his time,\r\nswallowed whole all the fictions to which the Church of Rome had\r\ngiven the imprimatur of infallibility.  Garrison's exploits are less\r\nlegendary, but are they much more substantial?  His fame rests on\r\ngeneralities.\r\n\r\nTo look at, he was neither soldier nor saint.  He had not, on the one\r\nhand, the air of command, nor, on the other, the sweetness or\r\nbenignity we expect from one of the heavenly host.  His face was both\r\nangry and weak.  His attitude on the platform was half apologetic and\r\nhalf passionate.  His speech at times was almost shrewish.  It was\r\nnever authoritative though always self-complacent.  So was the\r\nexpression of his face, with its smile which tried to be amiable and\r\nsucceeded in being self-conscious.  There was no fire in his pale\r\neyes; if there had been, his spectacles would have dulled it.  He\r\nstooped, and his most vehement appeals--they were often extremely\r\nvehement came to you sideways.  It was an unlucky effect, for there\r\nwas nothing shifty or crooked in the man's nature.  But he had a rôle\r\nto play--Isaiah, if you like--and played it as well as his means\r\nwould allow.\r\n\r\nIt was the indomitable honesty of the man which gave him such\r\nauthority as he had.  That is not a bad eulogy in itself.  Bad or\r\ngood, nothing I can say will diminish his reputation, nor do I wish\r\nit should.  When a legend has once grown up about a man it keeps on\r\ngrowing.  It has been decreed that Dickens shall be a great novelist,\r\nand Gladstone a great statesman, and Browning a great {120} poet, and\r\nHerbert Spencer a great philosopher.  Each of these men was great in\r\nother ways, but the legend is invincible.  So, no doubt, with\r\nGarrison.  He will remain the Liberator of the Slave.  By the time\r\nthe cold analysis of History reverses that verdict, personal\r\npartialities will have ceased to count.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{121}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCHARLES SUMNER--A PRIVATE VIEW\r\n\r\nThe anti-slavery leaders who emerged about the same time from the\r\ngroups of mediocrities enveloping them were Wendell Phillips and\r\nCharles Sumner.  So essentially was Sumner an idealist that he might\r\nnaturally have cast in his lot with those who preferred ideals to\r\nparty politics, but other influences finally prevailed and he\r\nembarked on that career which, in due time, made him the leader of\r\nthe anti-slavery forces to whom freedom seemed possible by political\r\nmethods.  On the whole, even among that group of men which included\r\nAndrew, I think Sumner must be put first.  His province was larger;\r\nthe range of his activities greater; and there were more moments than\r\none when he was the most conspicuous figure in American public life.\r\nOf his scholarship, his legal attainments, his multifarious and\r\naccurate knowledge, his immense powers of work, everybody has heard.\r\nI do not enter upon that.  The Sumner I shall speak of is the Sumner\r\nI knew.\r\n\r\nIn the account, first published in _The New York Tribune_, of my\r\nfirst meeting with Bismarck, in 1866, I said that I had heard much\r\nfrom Bismarck which {122} I could not repeat.  On my return, I saw\r\nSumner.  Almost instantly he asked what it was Bismarck had told me\r\nwhich I could not repeat in print.  The question was embarrassing\r\nenough, and I answered rather slowly:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Sumner, much of what Count Bismarck said that seemed to me\r\nconfidential related to diplomatic and international matters, and you\r\nare Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.  It would\r\nnot have been said to you.\"\r\n\r\nSumner reflected a moment, then answered:\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you are right.  I won't ask you about anything which you\r\nthink you ought not to repeat.  But you must consider that,\r\nnotwithstanding all that Bismarck has accomplished, he is still an\r\nunknown force.  My own belief is that the future of Germany lies in\r\nhis hands.  The man who could defy the public opinion of Europe in\r\nthat business with Denmark, who could defy the public opinion and\r\nParliament of Prussia, who could govern four years without a Budget\r\nor a majority, who could make war without supplies, and without his\r\ncountry behind him, and his King only a convert at the last moment to\r\nhis policy--that man, though he has put Austria under his feet and\r\nPrussia in Austria's place at the head of Germany, is, in my\r\njudgment, only at the beginning of his career.  He is the one\r\nsupremely interesting figure in Europe at this moment.  I have never\r\nmet him; probably may never meet him.  But it is important to me to\r\nknow all I can about him.  Violate no confidence, but tell me what\r\nyou can.  {123} I will make no use of it except to inform my own\r\nmind.  When I have to deal with Count Bismarck, I want to be able to\r\npicture to myself what manner of man he is.  In diplomacy, a\r\nknowledge of men is half the battle.\"\r\n\r\nThis long speech was characteristic of Sumner.  He was seldom brief\r\nor simple.  His mind overflowed.  In private, as in public, he was\r\noratorical.  The sentences, as they came from his lips, seemed to\r\nhave passed through a mould.  He spoke with a model before him.  The\r\nmost sincere of men he was never content to be himself and nobody\r\nelse.  In the murmur of the flowing periods he often uttered, you\r\nheard echoes of Cicero, of Bossuet, of Burke.  Perhaps it was true of\r\nhim--as Emerson said, not of him--that his library overloaded his\r\nwit.  He moved as if in armour; a mixed but apt metaphor.  The chair\r\nin which he sat was a platform, and his one listener was an audience.\r\nHe neglected, in his private talk, none of the arts of the\r\nrhetorician.  Whoever has heard Sumner in the Senate or in Faneuil\r\nHall must remember the imposing presence of the man; his stature: and\r\nthe leonine head with its waving black mane which every moment he\r\ntossed from his forehead, only to have it fall again half over his\r\neyes.  The strong features stood out sharply, the eyes were alight,\r\nthe lips moulded into plastic form the most stubborn sentences, and\r\nthe whole blended into one expression after another at the will of\r\nthe speaker; each expression the visible image of his thought.  He\r\nwas so intent on bending his audience {124} to his will that he used\r\nwithout stint every weapon at his command.\r\n\r\nIn private, all this was a little overwhelming.  As it comes back to\r\nme in memory, my view of it is probably more critical than it was\r\nwhile I sat and looked and listened.  But it still seems to me\r\nextremely fine.  In England--the country of all others where\r\nsimplicity counts for most--Sumner was thought emphatic; and the\r\nEnglish do not like emphasis, but they liked Sumner.  He was first\r\nhere as a young man, in 1838 and 1840, when he was still in the late\r\n'thirties; and these mannerisms were presumably less mannered, or\r\nless aggressive.  But the men and women whom Sumner then came to know\r\nwere men and women who dwelt on the heights.  I suppose the average\r\nof serious culture at that time in that class was at least as high as\r\nit is now.  They liked a man with a full mind.  Sumner had that; and\r\nhe poured it out in a flood.\r\n\r\nMacaulay had taught his set, or the several sets to which he more or\r\nless belonged, to endure conversation which took the form of\r\nmonologue and rivalled the laborious accuracy of a cyclopædia.\r\nPeople suffered under him.  Lady Holland and Hayward and Lord\r\nMelbourne and others rebelled, but there were not many who rebelled.\r\nSumner's path had therefore been made plain, nor was he dogmatic in\r\nMacaulay's way.  He was human and his enthusiasms were human, and he\r\nwas sympathetic.\r\n\r\nBut when Sumner, in 1869, made his indirect {125} Claims speech in\r\nthe Senate, seeking to induce the Government to demand from England\r\nindirect damages for the depredations of the Alabama, his popularity\r\nin this country came to a sudden end.  His best friends were those\r\nwho resented this speech most hotly; and Mr. Bright most of all.  To\r\nMr. Bright I once undertook to defend Sumner or to explain him, for I\r\nthought he had been misunderstood.  But Mr. Bright would not have it.\r\n\"The only defence is silence,\" he exclaimed, and he was the more\r\nangry when I said: \"That will do for an epigram.\"  And we never\r\nreferred to it again.\r\n\r\nSo far as I could, I satisfied Sumner's interest about Bismarck, whom\r\nI had seen at short range, and with whom, on the evening in question,\r\nI had spent some three hours alone.  Sumner asked question after\r\nquestion, with one definite object; he wanted to understand the man\r\nhimself.  Once or twice he put a searching interrogatory on matters\r\nof diplomacy, or on the relations between the King and his great\r\nMinister, which had to be answered with reserve.  He showed an\r\nastonishing knowledge of purely Prussian politics and even of\r\nPrussian politicians.  He asked if it was true that Loewe and the\r\nother Liberals had owned they were wrong in opposing Bismarck, and\r\nwhen I said yes, exclaimed: \"Then they showed more good sense than I\r\nexpected.\"\r\n\r\nI spent some days with Mr. Sumner in his house in Lafayette Square,\r\nin Washington, now part of a Washington hotel.  A plainly furnished\r\nhouse, {126} hardly a home; chiefly remarkable for its books and for\r\nSumner.  He was a kindly host, anxious that his guest should make the\r\nmost of his visit, and see the men he wanted to see.  I wanted to ask\r\nhim why he had, on a former visit, advised me not to see Lincoln; but\r\nI did not.  But Lincoln was now dead and among the giants who\r\nsurvived him Sumner was the most attractive personality.\r\n\r\nHe became more attractive still some years later, in 1872, when he\r\ncame to Europe for the rest which his long warfare, first with\r\nPresident Johnson and then with President Grant, had made imperative.\r\nHe came first to London, staying--or, as the English perversely say,\r\nstopping--at Penton's Hotel, St. James's Street; then a hostelry of\r\nrepute, now extinct.  He had a large suite of rooms on the ground\r\nfloor at the back; gloomy, and intensely respectable.  I dined with\r\nhim the night of his arrival.  \"I don't know what kind of a dinner\r\nthey will give us,\" said Sumner, \"but you shall have a bottle of\r\nChateau Lafitte of 1847, and the rest will matter less.\"  He loved\r\ngood Bordeaux, as all good men do; and his talk flowed like old\r\nwine--a full, pure stream, with both flavour and bouquet; and not\r\nmuch of the best claret has both.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to repeat much of Sumner's talk, for it was mostly\r\npersonal and intimate.  But I asked him whether he still felt the\r\neffects of those coward blows which Preston Brooks had dealt him from\r\nbehind as he sat imprisoned in his chair in the Senate.  He was not\r\nsure.  He {127} doubted whether he had ever completely recovered,\r\nthough it was now some sixteen years since that particular piece of\r\nSouth Carolina chivalry had been perpetrated.  He thought everything\r\nhad been done for him which could be done.  What he told me may or\r\nmay not have been printed.  I do not know.  When the moxa was to be\r\napplied to his spine, Dr. Charcot proposed to give him an anæsthetic.\r\n\"But,\" said Sumner, \"does not the effect you seek to produce--the\r\ncounter-irritation--depend more or less on the pain the patient would\r\nendure without the anæsthetic?\"  \"Yes,\" Charcot admitted,\r\nreluctantly, \"it probably does.\"  \"Then let us go ahead without\r\nether,\" said Sumner; and they did.  I understood the treatment\r\nconsisted in laying along the spine cotton-wool soaked in oil and\r\nsetting fire to it.  When, after two or three days, the burn is\r\npartly healed, the operation is renewed, and the pain, of course,\r\nmore severe.  But no ether was administered.  After his first attack\r\nof angina pectoris, \"the pain,\" said Sumner, \"which I endured in a\r\nsingle second from one of those spasms was more than all I ever\r\nsuffered from all the applications of the moxa.\"\r\n\r\nWe went together from London by way of Boulogne to Paris, staying two\r\nnights at Boulogne at one of the beach hotels.  Sumner was like a\r\nboy; his sixty-one years sat lightly on him and his interests were as\r\nfresh as I had ever known them.  He loved the sea and the sea air; an\r\nair so much more exhilarating on the southern coast of the {128}\r\nChannel than the northern.  He was amused to hear that the customs\r\nauthorities had passed all our luggage--his and mine--because I had\r\ntold them he was a Senator; and still more amused later when the\r\nDover customs on our return had shown him the same indulgence as \"The\r\nHonourable Charles Sumner\"--honourable denoting in England not\r\npolitical distinction, but membership of a family the head of which\r\nis a peer.  In Paris, as in London, we had rambled about the\r\nbook-shops.  \"I dare say,\" remarked Sumner, \"you thought from my\r\nbooks at home that I cared nothing for books as books; or for\r\nbindings.  But you will see.\"  And he proceeded to buy a certain\r\nnumber of so-called fine bindings: which, alas, were not so fine as\r\nthey ought to have been.\r\n\r\nLess than two years after his last months in Europe, he died.  I have\r\nstill much to say about him, and there are many letters of his to me\r\nwhich I hope to print; but they are not here and I must end.  When I\r\nremember what has been said so often of Sumner by men who did not\r\nknow him or did not like him, I may be allowed to end with a tribute\r\nof affection.  I thought him, and I shall ever think him, one of the\r\nmost lovable of men; more than loyal to his friends, delighting in\r\nkindnesses to them; of an implacable honesty, sincerity, devotion to\r\nduty and to high ideals; an American to whom America has paid high\r\nhonour, but never yet enough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{129}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nEXPERIENCES AS JOURNALIST DURING THE CIVIL WAR\r\n\r\nMy obligations to Wendell Phillips are mixed, and one of them was an\r\nintroduction to _The Tribune_.  In the autumn of 1861 I wanted two\r\nthings: a holiday, and a chance to see something of the war and the\r\nnegro question at short range.  At that time, Mr. Charles A. Dana was\r\nmanaging editor of _The Tribune_, with Mr. Sydney Howard Gay as his\r\nfirst lieutenant.  Phillips gave me a letter to Mr. Gay, the result\r\nof which was that Mr. Dana asked me to go to South Carolina for _The\r\nTribune_.\r\n\r\nA word about Mr. Dana.  He had the reputation at that time of being\r\nwhat the cabman called that Mr. John Forster who was, among other\r\nthings, the friend and biographer of Dickens--\"a harbitrary gent.\"  I\r\nsuppose Mr. Dana was arbitrary; in the sense that every commanding\r\nofficer must be arbitrary.  But my relations with him, or my service\r\nunder him, lasted some months, during the whole of which period I\r\nfound him considerate and kindly.  He liked, I think, to assign a man\r\nto duty and judge him by the result; which meant that the man was\r\nleft free to work out his {130} own salvation; or damnation, as the\r\ncase might be.\r\n\r\nI was, of course, perfectly new to the business of journalism and,\r\nequally of course, made many mistakes.  But Mr. Dana was not the kind\r\nof manager who fastened on this mistake or that as an occasion for\r\nchastising the offender.  He judged a man's work as a whole.  In the\r\noffice, I am told, he sometimes thought it needful to speak plainly\r\nin order to enforce a steady discipline.  He had been known to walk\r\ninto the room of one of the departmental editors, in full view and\r\nhearing of the whole staff, and remark: \"Mr. X, you were\r\ndisgracefully beaten this morning,\" in the tone in which he might\r\nhave said it was a fine day.  But the next morning Mr. X was not\r\nbeaten; nor the next.\r\n\r\nVery possibly, between me and Mr. Dana's wrath, if I roused it, stood\r\nMr. Gay; a man of soft manners and heart.  I cannot remember that,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, any reprimand ever came to me from Mr. Dana.\r\nFrom Mr. Greeley there came more than one; all well deserved.  With\r\nthe business of managing the paper Mr. Greeley did not much concern\r\nhimself.  With the results he sometimes did, and when _The Tribune_\r\ndid not contain what he thought it ought to contain, he was apt to\r\nmake remarks on the omission.  While I was at Port Royal in South\r\nCarolina there was a skirmish at Williamston in North Carolina, a\r\nhundred miles away.  Mr. Greeley thought I ought to have been at\r\nWilliamston.  Very likely I ought.  {131} But Lord Curzon had not at\r\nthat time announced his memorable definition of enterprising\r\njournalism; \"an intelligent anticipation of events that never occur.\"\r\nThat epigram, delivered in the House of Commons, may be supplemented\r\nby an axiom.  The business of a war correspondent is to be, not where\r\nhe is ordered, but where he is wanted.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the Civil War--or, for that matter, in the late\r\ndays--the American Press had little of the authority it has since\r\nacquired.  The heads of great departments of Government still held\r\nthemselves responsible primarily to the President.  Berths on\r\nbattleships were not then at the disposal of the first journalists\r\nwho wanted one.  When I asked Commodore Steadman of the _Bienville_\r\nto take me to Port Royal he politely told me it was against the naval\r\nregulations to allow a civilian on board a ship of war.  When I asked\r\nhim who had a dispensing power in such matters, he said: \"If the\r\nSecretary of the Navy should order me to receive you as a guest, I\r\nshould do so with pleasure.\"  I thanked him and with the courage of\r\nwhich ignorance is the mother, telegraphed Mr. Welles.  No answer.  I\r\ntelegraphed again, saying it was the wish of Mr. Dana that I should\r\ngo to South Carolina on the _Bienville_.  The effect of Mr. Dana's\r\nname was magical, and this time an answer came; that Commodore\r\nSteadman had orders to give me a berth.  I suppose the journalists of\r\nto-day will hardly understand how there could have been a difficulty.\r\nBut there were to be many difficulties.  Commodore {132} Steadman was\r\nas good as his word, and better; and a kind host.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dupont had captured the Port Royal forts by the time I\r\narrived.  A finer example of the old type of naval officer than\r\nAdmiral Dupont our naval service never had.  Captain Raymond Rodgers\r\nwas his flag captain; another example not less fine.  General W. T.\r\nSherman was in command of the land forces.  The winter passed slowly\r\naway.  There was not much to do except study the negro question;\r\nwhich was perhaps more attractive when studied at a distance.\r\nGeneral Butler, bringing the mind of a lawyer to bear on the problems\r\nof war, and desiring a legal excuse for annexing the personal\r\nproperty of the enemy had announced that the negroes were \"contraband\r\nof war.\"  For him, the maxim that laws are silent amid arms did not\r\nhold good.  He liked to make laws the servant of arms.  The negroes\r\nnaturally came soon to be known as contrabands.  There were some\r\nmonths during which they were called hardly anything else.  I called\r\nthem so in my letters.  It was characteristic of Phillips that, after\r\na time, he wrote to me to suggest that Butler's phrase had done its\r\nwork and that the negro was a negro: a man entitled to freedom on\r\nother grounds.\r\n\r\nBut it was long before the word passed out of use.  Butler had chosen\r\nthe psychological moment.  The \"contrabands\"--with Mr. Phillips's\r\npermission--who crowded the camps were mostly from the cotton and\r\nrice plantations of South Carolina and Georgia.  If you were not\r\nalready {133} a convinced Abolitionist, they were not likely to\r\nconvert you.  But it was becoming daily clearer that the negro had a\r\nmilitary value; not at Port Royal, however, where he was only a\r\nburden.  It was not an eventful winter at Port Royal.  There were\r\nexpeditions by land and sea, and there was the taking of Fort\r\nPulaski, which I saw, but I was glad to return to New York in the\r\nspring; and then to join General Frémont in the Shenandoah Valley.\r\nThe name of that commander was still one of promise.  Except the\r\nname, there was not much else for the purposes of war, but he had a\r\ncharm of manner and a touch of romance and a staff on which one or\r\ntwo foreign adventurers had places and did weird things.  \"General\"\r\nCluseret was one; an impostor who afterward found a congenial home in\r\nthe Paris Commune, with other impostors.  That campaign came to\r\nnought, and when General Pope, in July, 1862, was put in command of\r\nthe Army of Virginia, I found my way to the headquarters of that\r\nredoubtable warrior.\r\n\r\nWith him, in command of the Third Army Corps, was General McDowell.\r\nI don't know why one's memory chooses trivialities as proper objects\r\nof its activity, but it sometimes does.  One of the most vivid among\r\nthe impressions of those days is the stout figure of General McDowell\r\non his horse, which he sat ill, his uniform awry, his sword pushed\r\nbehind him as far as it would go, his strapless trousers ending\r\nabruptly halfway between knee and ankle; then a space of bare flesh,\r\n{134} and then some inches of white stocking, and then a shoe.  But\r\nhe had military gifts if not a military air.  He was talking with\r\nGeneral Pope, whose unhappy proclamation about his headquarters in\r\nthe saddle had already been issued.  Unlike McDowell, Pope looked a\r\nbetter soldier than he was.  His six weeks' generalship on the\r\nRappahannock ended with the Second Bull Run, which there was now no\r\nBilly Russell to describe in words that blistered yet were honest\r\nwords; and with Chantilly.  The West suited Pope better than the\r\nEast, and to the West he returned.  In these six weeks he had made\r\nnothing but mistakes and achieved only defeats.\r\n\r\nPersonally, General Pope was pleasant to deal with.  It was while he\r\ncommanded the Army of Virginia that Mr. Stanton, then Secretary of\r\nWar, or perhaps General Halleck, issued orders for the expulsion of\r\nall correspondents from the armies in the field.  General Pope sent\r\nfor me and told me of the order.  Impressed at that time with the\r\nsternness of War Office rule, I answered meekly that I supposed I\r\nmust go.  Said General Pope, \"This is not an official interview.  I\r\nimagine you needn't go till you get the order.\"  A battle was thought\r\nto be imminent; any respite was welcome.  I thanked him, went back to\r\nmy tent, took what I most needed, and rode off to an outpost where I\r\nhad a friend.  The official notification may have been sent to my\r\ntent but never reached me.  And so it happened that I saw such\r\nfighting as there was on the Rappahannock, and at the Second {135}\r\nBull Run, better called Manassas.  Interesting to a student of war;\r\nnot inspiriting to a patriot; and not now to be described even in the\r\nbriefest way.  My only aim is to give the reader of to-day some faint\r\nnotion of what a war correspondent's life in those days was like.\r\n\r\nOne incident I may note, as an example of what may happen to a\r\ngeneral who neglects the most elementary rules and precautions of\r\nwar.  At the end of a day's march, at sundown but the heavens still\r\nlight, General Pope bethought himself that he should like to see what\r\nthe country ahead of him looked like.  With his staff and a bodyguard\r\nof some sixty sabres he rode up a low hill with a broad crest, open\r\nground about it for a hundred yards, and beyond that in front a\r\nthick, far-spreading forest line.  General Pope and his staff\r\ndismounted.  The cavalry were ordered to dismount and loosen their\r\nsaddle-girths.  Just as this operation had been completed there came\r\nfrom the wood beyond the open ground a rifle volley.  As we stood\r\nbetween the sunset and the enemy we were a pretty fair target.  There\r\nwas no time for orders.  Everybody scrambled into his saddle as best\r\nhe could and away we went.\r\n\r\nBut the firing woke up the advance guard of our army, and they also\r\nbegan firing.  It soon appeared that General Pope had unwittingly\r\npassed outside his own lines, so that, as we rode away from the fire\r\nof the Rebels we rode into the fire of our own troops.  It was hot\r\nenough but luckily did not last long.  The hill partly protected\r\n{136} us from the sharpshooters in grey, and our fire was silenced\r\nafter a moment.  But the horses were well frightened.  It was\r\nimpossible to pull up.  We scattered and the horses went on for a\r\nmile or so.  I never before so much respected the intelligence of\r\nthat animal.  There was nothing to do but sit down in the saddle, but\r\nthe horses never made a mistake at full speed over an unknown\r\ncountry, stiff with fences and brooks, and nobody came to grief; nor,\r\nwhich seems more wonderful, was anybody hit by the bullets.  A good\r\nmany remarks were made which hit General Pope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{137}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCIVIL WAR--GENERAL McCLELLAN--GENERAL HOOKER\r\n\r\nThe failure of Pope's campaign and his retreat upon the Capital\r\ndemoralized his army and demoralized Washington to an extent which\r\nfew remember.  The degree of the demoralization may, however, be\r\nmeasured by the reappointment of General McClellan to the command of\r\nthe Army of the Potomac and of Virginia.  In the absence of any\r\ngeneral whose name inspired confidence, General McClellan was thought\r\na synonym of safety, or, at any rate, of caution, and he had not\r\nwholly lost the confidence of his men.  He was not expected to enter\r\nupon large operations.\r\n\r\nAn engagement near Washington was, however, thought probable.  On a\r\nhint from a friendly official I rode out one afternoon from\r\nWashington to the army headquarters, expecting to be away at most a\r\nday or two.  My luggage consisted of a mackintosh and a tooth-brush.\r\nI was absent six weeks.  But this was not so tragic as it sounds, for\r\nMaryland was a country in which, even with a war afoot, it was\r\npossible to buy things.  In the interval, I had seen two battles;\r\nSouth Mountain {138} and Antietam, which came as near to being real\r\nwar as could be expected under General McClellan.\r\n\r\nCorrespondents were not now allowed with the army in the field any\r\nmore than in General Pope's time.  We were contraband.  But so long\r\nas we yielded nominally to the inhibition of the War Office nobody\r\nseemed to care.  The War Office was then named Edwin M. Stanton.  To\r\nthis day I have never been able to understand how Mr. Stanton--a man\r\nall energy, directness of mind and purpose, scorning compromise and\r\nhalf measures and scorning those who practised them--came to assent\r\nto the replacing of General McClellan at the head of the Army of the\r\nPotomac.  But he did, and at first General McClellan seemed to\r\njustify the new hopes newly placed in him.  He might have sat still,\r\nbut after providing for the defence of Washington he moved out upon\r\nan aggressive-defensive campaign.  General Lee had entered Maryland\r\nand McClellan went in search of him.  He moved slowly, but he moved.\r\nHis soldiers, so far as I could judge, believed in him in spite of\r\nhis disasters in the Peninsula.  His generals, I think, did not.  I\r\nsaw and talked with some of them, for I found myself making this\r\ncampaign as a volunteer aide-de-camp to General Sedgwick.  I had met\r\nGeneral Sedgwick before, and when I had to consider how I was to get\r\nleave to go with the troops I went to General Sedgwick and told him\r\nmy difficulty.  \"Come along with me,\" he said.  That was all the\r\nappointment I had.  It would not have been {139} possible in a\r\nEuropean army, but in the armies of the Union many things were\r\npossible.  And it was quite sufficient to take me outside of Mr.\r\nStanton's order about correspondents.  I was not a correspondent; I\r\nwas one of General Sedgwick's aids.  His kindness to me was a service\r\nfor which I could never be too grateful.\r\n\r\nIt was a still greater service because General Sedgwick belonged in\r\nthe category of fighting generals, who were none too popular with the\r\ngeneral commanding, since he, mixing politics with war, believed in\r\nhalf-beating the enemy.  Sedgwick, so far as I know, had no politics.\r\nCertainly he had none in the field.  He was there to fight, not to\r\nbuild bridges over which the Rebels might come back into the Union.\r\nIt had become known that General Lee had entered Maryland, to enable\r\nher people \"to throw off a foreign yoke.\"  He was not, as it turned\r\nout, a welcome guest.  Maryland would have been much obliged to him\r\nif he had stayed on the other side of the Potomac.  McClellan, taking\r\ntime to think things over, and perhaps not liking to be considered a\r\nforeign yoke, advanced toward Frederick, Lee's headquarters for the\r\nmoment, at the breakneck pace of six or seven miles a day.  I suppose\r\nMcClellan must have known that Lee wanted Harpers Ferry.  But even\r\nafter Lee's general order had come into his possession, with specific\r\ndirections for the movement of each division, McClellan hesitated and\r\nfinally took the wrong road.\r\n\r\nHence the battle of South Mountain; a {140} picturesque performance;\r\npart of which I watched by the side of General McClellan himself.  At\r\nthe moment he was quite alone; his staff away carrying orders; an\r\nofficer now and then returning only to be sent off again at once.\r\nThe general presently saw that a stranger was standing near him and\r\nasked a question or two.  I offered him my field glasses, but he said\r\nhe could see very well and declined them.\r\n\r\nThere was in his appearance something prepossessing if not\r\ncommanding: something rather scholarly than warlike; amiable,\r\nwell-bred, cold, and yet almost sympathetic.  His troops were slowly\r\nforcing their way up the steep mountain side upon which we looked.\r\nIt was, in fact, from a military point of view, a very critical\r\nmoment, but this general commanding had a singular air of detachment;\r\nalmost that of a disinterested spectator: or of a general watching\r\nmanoeuvres.  The business of war seemed to be to him merely what Iago\r\ncalls \"the bookish theoric\"; and he himself \"a great arithmetician.\"\r\nHe had the face of a man of thought.  Napoleonic, said his idolaters,\r\nwho called him the young Napoleon: not considering dates, or not\r\naware that when Napoleon planned and won his great Italian campaign,\r\na masterpiece of war, he was twenty-seven.  When McClellan planned\r\nand lost his Peninsula campaign, he was thirty-seven.  But there he\r\nstood; an interesting figure; as if stargazing.  Compact,\r\nsquare-chested, his face well moulded.  That he was directing the\r\nassault of {141} the forces struggling up yonder hill no human being\r\ncould have guessed.  Whether his tailor had been too stingy in the\r\nmaterial of his uniform, or Nature too lavish in the contents of it,\r\nhe was uncomfortable; he and his clothes did not seem made for each\r\nother.  There were wrinkles.  There was a missing button; nor was he\r\na well set-up figure.  It may well enough have been because of his\r\nmilitary career, but I thought an air of indecision hung about him.\r\nMen had died by hundreds and were yet to die because he could not\r\nmake up his mind, nor push an attack home.  They were dying now, as\r\nhe looked on; they lay dying and dead on the opposite slope; for when\r\nhe had at last made up his mind he had made it up wrong.  The battle\r\nof South Mountain was a victory in a sense, but it need never have\r\nbeen fought.  A position which might have been turned had been\r\nforced, and the road to Antietam lay open.\r\n\r\nAgain it was like McClellan, on approaching Sharpsburg and the\r\nbattleground of Antietam, to halt and think it over.  If he had\r\nstruck at once, he would have found Lee's army divided and the path\r\nweakly held.  But McClellan had it not in him to do anything at once,\r\nor to do it once for all.  The armies faced each other idly all that\r\nday.  In the afternoon I heard that a flank movement on the enemy's\r\nleft was to be tried under General Hooker.  So I rode over and joined\r\nthat general's command.  It was well known that Hooker would fight if\r\nhe was allowed.  He was already called {142} \"Fighting Joe\"; a\r\nwell-earned sobriquet.  He put his troops in motion about four\r\no'clock that afternoon, himself at the head as usual, doing his own\r\nreconnoitring.  I rode with the staff, not one of whom I knew.\r\nNobody took the trouble to ask who I was or why I was there.  For\r\naught they knew I might have been a Rebel spy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hooker had his own way of doing things.  This was what might\r\nbe called a reconnaissance in force; two brigades in line pushing\r\nsteadily forward; a force of cavalry in advance, two divisions\r\nfollowing.  By the time we came in touch with Lee's left, it was\r\ndusk.  We could see the flashes of the Rebel rifles which drove\r\nHooker's cavalry back upon the infantry division.  Hooker played the\r\ngame of war as the youngest member of a football team plays football.\r\nHe had to the full that joy of battle which McClellan never had at\r\nall; and showed it.\r\n\r\nBetween the man by whose side I had stood two days before at South\r\nMountain, and the man near whom I now rode, the contrast was\r\ncomplete.  McClellan was not a general; he was a Council of War, and\r\nit is a military axiom that councils of war never fight.  He surveyed\r\nthe field of battle beneath him at Turner's Gap as a chess-player\r\nsurveys the board.  At the naval battle of Santiago, as the Spanish\r\nships were sinking, our bluejackets began to cheer.  Said Admiral\r\nPhilip: \"Don't cheer, boys.  They are dying over there.\"  If\r\neverything else about Philip should be forgotten, that will be\r\nremembered; and he will be loved {143} for it; for this one touch of\r\nhuman feeling for a human enemy amid the hell of war.  But for the\r\npawns and pieces the chess-player sends to slaughter he has no\r\nregrets.  I don't say McClellan had none for the men whom his\r\nmistaken strategy drove to death.  All I say is that as I looked at\r\nhim I saw no sign of it.  A general, we are told, can no more afford\r\nto have feelings amid a battle than a surgeon with the knife in his\r\nhand can feel for his patient.  It may be.  But Napoleon, who is\r\nalways cited as the highest example of indifference to the lives of\r\nmen, is perhaps the best example to the contrary.  He would sacrifice\r\na brigade without scruple for a purpose; never one single armed man\r\nwithout a purpose.  He had men enough to consume for victory; never\r\none to squander.  He was an economist of human life, though for\r\npurely military reasons.  It is awful to reflect how many thousands\r\nof Americans in these early Civil War days were sent to death\r\nuselessly by the ignorance of their commanders; or as in McClellan's\r\ncase by his irresolution, and his incapacity for the handling of\r\ntroops in the field.\r\n\r\nGeneral Hooker's was a face which lighted up when the battle began.\r\nThe man seemed transformed.  He rode carelessly on the march, but sat\r\nstraight up in his saddle as the martial music of the bullets\r\nwhistled past him.  He was a leader of men, and his men would have\r\nfollowed him and did follow him wherever he led.  Hesitation, delay,\r\nhe hated them.  \"If they had let us start earlier {144} we might have\r\nfinished to-night,\" he muttered.  But night was upon us, and even\r\nHooker could not fight an unknown force on unknown ground in the\r\ndark.  It was nine o'clock when we went into camp; Union and Rebel\r\nlines so close that the pickets got mixed and captured each other.\r\n\"Camp\" is a figure of speech.  We lay down on the ground as we were.\r\nI slept with my horse's bridle round my arm.  At four o'clock next\r\nmorning, with the earliest light of a coming dawn and as soon as a\r\nman could see the sights on his rifle, the battle began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{145}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nCIVIL WAR--PERSONAL INCIDENTS AT ANTIETAM\r\n\r\nGeneral Hooker was about the first man in the saddle.  The pickets\r\nhad begun sniping long before dawn.  My bivouac was within sight of\r\nhis tent.  \"The old man,\" said one of his staff, \"would have liked to\r\nbe with the pickets.\"  No doubt.  He would have liked to be anywhere\r\nin the field where the chance of a bullet coming his way was\r\ngreatest.  Kinglake has a passage which might have been written for\r\nHooker.  That accomplished historian of war remarks that the reasons\r\nagainst fighting a battle are always stronger than the reasons for\r\nfighting.  If it were to be decided on the balance of arguments, no\r\nbattle would ever be begun.  But there are Generals who have in them\r\nan overmastering impulse of battle; it is in the blood; temperament\r\nprevails over argument, and they are the men who carry on war.\r\nHooker was one of them.  He loved fighting for fighting's sake, and\r\nwith the apostles of peace at any price he had not an atom of\r\nsympathy.  He would have thought Herbert Spencer something less than\r\na man, as he was; and Mr. Carnegie, if he had been anything then but\r\nthe {146} boy he has never outgrown, a worthy disciple of an unworthy\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nNo, I am not keeping you waiting for the story of Antietam, for I am\r\nnot going to re-tell it.  But General Hooker, on that day a hero, has\r\nhad hard measure since, and I like to do him what justice I can.  I\r\nliked the man.  My acquaintance with him began that morning.  To hear\r\nhim issue an order was like the sound of the first cannon shot.  He\r\ngathered up brigades and divisions in his hand, and sent them\r\nstraight against the enemy.  That is not at all a piece of rhetoric.\r\nIt is a literal statement of the literal fact.  His men loved him and\r\ndreaded him.  Early in the morning he had scattered his staff to the\r\nwinds, and was riding alone, on the firing line.  Looking about him\r\nfor an officer, he saw me and said, \"Who are you?\"  I told him.\r\n\"Will you take an order for me?\"  \"Certainly.\"  There was a regiment\r\nwhich seemed wavering, and had fallen a little back.  \"Tell the\r\ncolonel of that regiment to take his men to the front and keep them\r\nthere.\"  I gave the order.  Again the question:\r\n\r\n\"Who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"The order is General Hooker's.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must come to me from a staff officer or from my brigade\r\ncommander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good.  I will report to General Hooker that you decline to\r\nobey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for God's sake don't do that!  The Rebels are too many for us\r\nbut I had rather face them than Hooker.\"\r\n\r\n{147}\r\n\r\nAnd on went his regiment.  I returned to Hooker and reported.  \"Yes,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I see, but don't let the next man talk so much\"; and I was\r\nsent off again.\r\n\r\nI was with Hooker when he was wounded, about nine o'clock.  He was,\r\nas he always was, the finest target in the field and a natural mark\r\nfor the Rebel sharpshooters.  It was easy to see that they followed\r\nhim, and their bullets followed him, wherever he rode.  I pointed\r\nthat out to him.  He replied with an explosion of curses and\r\ncontempt.  He did not believe he could be hit.  No Rebel bullet was\r\nto find its billet in him.  He was tall and sat high in his saddle.\r\nHe was of course in uniform--no khaki in those days, but bright blue,\r\nand gilt buttons and all the rest of it; his high-coloured face\r\nitself a mark, and he rode a white horse.  Not long after I had\r\nspoken, a bullet struck him in the foot.  It was the best bullet\r\nthose troublesome gentlemen in grey fired that morning.  He swayed in\r\nthe saddle and fell, or would have fallen if he had not been caught.\r\nThen they carried to the rear the hope of the Union arms for that\r\nday; and for other days to follow.\r\n\r\nI saw him again about four in the afternoon.  I had been asked to see\r\nhim by one or two of General McClellan's staff who knew I had been\r\nwith General Hooker in the morning.  I have said long since what the\r\nerrand was they wished to lay upon me, or what I supposed it to be.\r\nGeneral Wilson explained to me, on the publication of that {148}\r\narticle, that I had mistaken the meaning of the men I talked with;\r\nthat the officers who asked me to go never designed that I should\r\nsuggest to Hooker to take command of the army, but only to find out\r\nwhether he could resume the command of his own corps; and perhaps of\r\nanother; not waiting for orders, apparently.  It does not much\r\nmatter, for I, of course, declined to carry any such message as I\r\nthought was proposed to me.  It was for the officers themselves, if\r\nfor anybody, to carry it.  If they had any such purpose in mind, it\r\nwas mutiny; patriotic but unmilitary.  Well might they lose patience\r\nwhen they saw the promise of a shattered rebellion fade before their\r\neyes.  But that day was not yet, happily, since a premature victory\r\nover the South would have left great questions unsettled.  This\r\nscheme, or dream, was none the less interesting because it showed, as\r\nI thought, what McClellan's own officers thought of his generalship\r\non that fateful day; and possibly of something besides his\r\ngeneralship.\r\n\r\nBut I went to the little square red-brick house where Hooker had been\r\ntaken, and was allowed to see him.  It needed no questions.  He was\r\ntoo evidently done for; till that day and many days to come had\r\npassed.  He was suffering great pain.  I told him I had come by\r\nrequest of some of General McClellan's staff to ask how he was.\r\n\r\n\"You can see for yourself,\" he answered faintly.  \"The pain is bad\r\nenough, but what I hate to think is that it was a Rebel bullet which\r\ndid it.\"\r\n\r\nHis courage was indomitable; his contempt for {149} the Rebels not\r\none whit abated.  He asked for the latest news from the field of\r\nbattle.  I told him it was no longer a field of battle; that\r\nMcClellan was resting on his arms; that he would not use his\r\nreserves; and that there was every prospect that Lee would escape\r\nwith his beaten army across the Potomac.  He raged at the thought.\r\n\r\n\"Unless,\"--I added.\r\n\r\n\"You need not go on,\" retorted Hooker.  \"You must see I cannot move.\"\r\n\r\nIt tortured him to think that his morning's work was half thrown\r\naway; and that McClellan, with some fourteen thousand fresh troops,\r\nwas content to see the sun go down on an indecisive day.  Into his\r\nface, white with the pain which tore at him, came heat and colour and\r\nthe anger of an indignant soul.  The surgeon shook his head, and I\r\nsaid good-bye.\r\n\r\nI rode back to headquarters; only to find that the decision had been\r\ntaken or perhaps that McClellan was incapable of any decision; his\r\nmind halting, as usual, between two opinions; and the negative in the\r\nend prevailing over the positive.  He had an irresistible impulse to\r\ndo nothing he could leave undone.  I asked for General Sedgwick.  He\r\nhad been badly wounded--I think thrice wounded, but had fought on\r\ntill the third--and been carried off the field.  Nobody could tell me\r\nwhere he was.  I saw him once again.  A Rebel bullet laid him low at\r\nSpottsylvania.  One of the best generals we had: a man of utterly\r\ntransparent honesty, simplicity, and truth of {150} character;\r\ntrusted, beloved, ardently followed by his men; a commander who had\r\ndone great things and was capable of greater.\r\n\r\nSince it was too late to get anything through to New York that night,\r\nI wasted some hours in one camp and another.  Perhaps they were not\r\nwasted.  I heard everywhere a chorus of execration.  McClellan's name\r\nwas hardly mentioned without a curse.  Not a soldier in the ranks who\r\ndid not believe it had been possible to drive Lee into and over the\r\nPotomac.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock in the evening I started for Frederick, thirty miles\r\naway.  My horse had two bullets in him, and I had to commandeer\r\nanother from a colleague, who objected but yielded.  I reached\r\nFrederick at three in the morning, sleeping in the saddle a good part\r\nof the way, as I had been up since four o'clock of the morning\r\nbefore.  The telegraph office was closed, and nobody knew where the\r\ntelegraph clerk lived.  I thought it odd that in time of war, and\r\nafter an important battle, the Government at Washington should have\r\nkept open no means of communication with the general commanding; but\r\nso it was.  Frederick was the nearest and, so far as I knew, the only\r\navailable telegraph office.  There was no field telegraph.  The wires\r\nwere not down, but the operator was sleeping peacefully elsewhere.\r\n\r\nHe reappeared about seven.  I asked him if he would take a message.\r\nAfter some demur he promised to try to get a short one through.  I\r\nsat down on a log by the door and began to write, {151} giving him\r\nsheet after sheet till a column or more had gone, as I supposed, to\r\nNew York.  _The Tribune_ had been notified that a message was coming.\r\nBut neither my private notice to _The Tribune_ nor my story of the\r\nbattle was sent to New York.  It was sent to the War Office at\r\nWashington, and such was the disorder then prevailing that it was the\r\nfirst news, or perhaps only the first coherent account, of the battle\r\nwhich reached the War Office and the President.  They kept it to\r\nthemselves during all that day.  At night, in time for next morning's\r\npaper, it was released, wired on, and duly appeared in Saturday's\r\n_Tribune_.\r\n\r\nI never doubted that when my telegram had once been sent I should\r\nfind a train to Baltimore.  There was none.  I saw one official after\r\nanother.  Nobody knew, or nobody would say, when a train would leave.\r\nIt might go at any moment, or not at all.  I tried in vain for a\r\nspecial.  There could be no special without military warrant.  I\r\nwired the War Office and got no answer.  It was trying work, for what\r\nI had hoped was to reach New York in time for Saturday morning's\r\npaper.  Finally, I was allowed to travel by a mixed train which\r\narrived in Baltimore some ten minutes before the Washington express\r\nfor New York came in.\r\n\r\nThat is all the margin there was.  The cars were lighted by oil\r\nlamps, dimly burning, one at each end of the car, hung near the\r\nceiling.  I had to choose between the chance of wiring a long and as\r\nyet unwritten dispatch from Baltimore, {152} and going myself by\r\ntrain.  The first word at the telegraph office settled it.  They\r\nwould promise nothing.\r\n\r\nSo by the light of the one dim oil lamp, above my head, standing, I\r\nbegan a narrative of the battle of Antietam.  I wrote with a pencil.\r\nIt must have been about nine o'clock when I began.  I ended as the\r\ntrain rolled into Jersey City by daylight.  The office knew that a\r\ndispatch was coming, the compositors were waiting, and at six o'clock\r\nthe worst piece of manuscript the oldest of them had ever seen was\r\nput into their hands.  But they were good men, and there were\r\nproof-readers of genius, and somewhere near the uptown breakfast\r\nhour, _The Tribune_ issued an extra with six columns about Antietam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{153}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nA FRAGMENT OF UNWRITTEN MILITARY HISTORY\r\n\r\nBy this time--September, 1862--Mr. Dana had retired from _The\r\nTribune_ and Mr. Sydney Howard Gay had become managing editor in Mr.\r\nDana's place.  The natural gift of command which belonged to Mr. Dana\r\nhad not descended upon Mr. Gay; it never does descend; but he was\r\ncapable of a quick decision, and when, having returned that morning\r\nfrom Antietam, I saw him in the afternoon, he was in a\r\nmanaging-editor state of mind.  With much firm kindness of manner he\r\nsuggested that I should start that evening to rejoin the army.  I\r\nsaid yes, because, in my inexperience and in my artless awe of my\r\nsuperior officer, I did not know what else to say.  And I took the\r\nnight train to Washington.\r\n\r\nWith the discomforts of the night railway service between New York\r\nand Washington I had already made acquaintance.  They were\r\nconsiderable, but less than they are now.  There was then no\r\noverheated Pullman car; there was no overbearing coloured porter to\r\npatronize you, and to brush the dust from other people's clothes into\r\nyour face, and to heat the furnace--by which I {154} mean the\r\nsteam-heated car--seven times hotter; there was no promiscuous\r\ndormitory.  When Lord Charles Beresford was last in Washington, four\r\nor five years ago, he told me one afternoon he was going to New York\r\nby the midnight train.  When I suggested that the day service was\r\nless unpleasant than the night, he answered: \"Oh, it doesn't matter\r\nto me.  I can sleep on a clothes-line.\"  There spoke the sailor lad\r\nof whom there are still traces in the great admiral of to-day.  I\r\nhave never tried the clothes-line, but I had lately been sleeping for\r\nmany nights together on the sacred soil of Virginia, or the perhaps\r\nless sacred soil of Maryland, thinking myself lucky if I could borrow\r\ntwo rails from a Virginia fence to sleep between.  I am not sure\r\nwhether I liked the stiff seats of the old-fashioned coach much\r\nbetter, but I am quite sure I should prefer the open air and the\r\nsacred soil and the Virginia rails to the \"luxurious\" stuffiness of\r\nthe modern sleeping car.  The only real luxury I know of in American\r\nrailway travel is the private car.\r\n\r\nHowever, I might as well have stayed in New York, for I was soon\r\ninvalided back again with a camp fever, and then remained in the\r\noffice to write war \"editorials,\" and others.\r\n\r\nBut I was to make one more journey to the field, and once more to see\r\nGeneral Hooker.  General McClellan, thinking it over for a month and\r\nmore after Antietam, had finally crossed the Potomac, dawdled about a\r\nlittle, and been ordered to Trenton, New Jersey, well out of the way\r\nof {155} further mischief.  General Burnside had succeeded McClellan;\r\nhad fought and lost the battle of Fredericksburg, with the maximum of\r\nincompetency, in December, 1862; had McClellanized till January 25th,\r\nand had then yielded up the command of the unhappy Army of the\r\nPotomac to General Hooker.  Fighting Joe spent some three months in\r\ngetting his army into good fighting order; then tried his luck\r\nagainst Lee and Stonewall Jackson at Chancellorsville.  Luck in the\r\nshape of a bullet, whether Union or Rebel took Jackson out of his\r\nway; but Lee, perhaps for the first time, showed the greater\r\nqualities of generalship, and Hooker, at the end of a three days\r\nbattle, was defeated; the Union forces recrossing the Rappahannock on\r\nthe night of May 4th, 1863.\r\n\r\nI must apologize for restating, even in the briefest form, facts\r\nwhich everybody knows.  I do it because, soon after Chancellorsville,\r\nI was sent again to the Army of the Potomac on a mission of inquiry.\r\nIt was almost the blackest period of the war; the darkness before\r\ndawn; a dawn which was to come from the West as well as from the\r\nEast.  The army was demoralized; so was public opinion; so, I think,\r\nwere the military authorities in Washington; and nobody knew where to\r\nlook for a commanding officer.  There remained not one in whom the\r\nPresident or the Army of the Potomac had faith.  They were groping\r\nfor a General, and groping so far as the East was concerned, in the\r\ndark.  My business was to throw such as light as I could on the\r\ncauses {156} of Hooker's defeat, and to find out, if I could, whom\r\nthe Army of the Potomac wanted as leader.  And I was given to\r\nunderstand that the results of my inquiry would be published in _The\r\nTribune_.\r\n\r\nThey never were.  I spent rather more than a week with the army, at\r\none headquarters or another.  General Hooker, to whom I of course\r\npresented myself in the first instance, very kindly asked me to be\r\nhis guest, but that was impossible.  I could not be the guest of the\r\nman whom I was to investigate.  I told Hooker my errand.  As General\r\ncommanding, he had the right to order me out of the lines, which\r\nwould have brought my mission to an end.  Instead, he offered me all\r\nfacilities consistent with his duty.  \"If I am to be investigated,\"\r\nhe said, rather grimly, \"it might as well be by you as anybody.\"\r\nIndeed; he had a kindness for me and had offered me, or tried to\r\noffer, after Antietam, a place on his staff; which military\r\nregulations did not permit.  It was not necessary to tell him I had\r\nevery wish he might come well out of the examination.  But I had.\r\n\r\nSo I went about to one general and another and from one corps to\r\nanother, and talked with men of all ranks and of no rank.  I knew\r\nGeneral Sedgwick best and went to him first.  He was a man of action\r\nrather than words, and was reluctant to talk.  Besides, his share in\r\nthe battle had been greater than anybody's but Hooker himself.  He\r\ntold me what his orders had been, and how he had tried to carry them\r\nout.  Up to a certain point, he had been successful.  He had crossed\r\nthe Rappahannock {157} in the early morning of May 3rd, carried the\r\nheights near Fredericksburg by noon, advanced toward Chancellor's\r\nwith intent to turn Lee's rear, till he brought up against an\r\nimmovable Rebel force late in the afternoon.  He held his position\r\nall night and during most of the next day, the 4th.  Then Lee, who\r\nwas at his best, brought up more troops, and forced Sedgwick back\r\nacross the river at night.  He had lost five thousand men.\r\n\r\nFrom what Sedgwick told me and from what others told me, I gathered\r\nthat this was the critical point of the battle.  If Hooker could\r\neither have kept these Rebel reinforcements busy elsewhere, or have\r\nstrengthened Sedgwick earlier in the day, the Rebel lines would have\r\nbeen broken or turned, and the battle won.  But he was outmanoeuvred\r\nby Lee, here and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThat is Chancellorsville in a nutshell.  Hooker was, I suppose,\r\noverweighted with the command of an army of a hundred and twenty\r\nthousand men.  As a corps commander and for fighting purposes, he had\r\nno equal.  But he was pitted against a General whom European critics\r\nhave praised till they seem inclined to put him on a level with\r\nHannibal or Moltke, where he certainly does not belong.  But he was\r\ngood enough in these May days of 1863 to defeat General Hooker.\r\n\r\nThere have been stories in print to which I refer because they have\r\nbeen in print.  It was said of General Hooker, as it was said of a\r\ngreater General in this Civil War, that he drank.  Lincoln's {158}\r\nwish to send a barrel of Grant's whisky to every other General in the\r\nUnion armies had not then been expressed.  But, in the first place,\r\nhaving heard this rumour before I left New York, I asked everybody\r\nlikely to know, and not one witness could testify to having seen\r\nGeneral Hooker the worse for whisky.  There is, in the second place,\r\na statement that while Hooker was standing, on the morning of the\r\n3rd, near Chancellor's Inn, the porch was struck by a cannon shot,\r\nand a beam fell on Hooker's head.  He was not disabled, but the\r\nworking power of his brain, at high pressure night and day for some\r\nsixty hours, may well have been impaired.  One story may be set off\r\nagainst the other.\r\n\r\nRightly or wrongly, the Army of the Potomac had lost confidence in\r\nGeneral Hooker.  It had also lost confidence in itself.  It was a\r\nbeaten army and the soul had gone out of it.  On both points, the\r\nevidence was overwhelming.  There could be no doubt that I must\r\nreport to Mr. Gay that the demoralization was complete.  When I set\r\nmyself to discover a remedy--in other words a possible successor to\r\nGeneral Hooker--I was at a loss.  General Sedgwick's officers and men\r\nbelieved in him, but the army as a whole thought he was in his right\r\nplace as a corps commander.  Other names were mentioned and put\r\naside.  There was no reason why officers high in rank should talk\r\nfreely to me.  There was every reason they should not talk freely to\r\nthe representative of _The Tribune_, if _The Tribune_ was to publish\r\nan {159} account of the state of public opinion in the army with\r\nreference to a new commander.  I endeavoured to make it clear that\r\nall statements on this matter would be treated as confidential.\r\nStill, as you may imagine, there were difficulties.\r\n\r\nIf one man was named more often than another, it was General Meade.\r\nI was urged by a number of officers--mostly staff officers--as I had\r\nbeen at Antietam in connection with General Hooker, to see General\r\nMeade and lay before him what my friends declared to be the wish of\r\nthe army, or of a great part of the army.  They wanted him to succeed\r\nGeneral Hooker.  It did not seem desirable to pledge myself to\r\nanything, but I did see General Meade.  I had met him but once\r\nbefore.  He was just mounting his horse, and proposed that we should\r\nride together.  Explaining that, though I came on no mission and with\r\nno authority, I had been asked to lay certain matters before him, I\r\ngave him such an account as I could of what my friends thought the\r\narmy wanted.  When he saw what was coming, he turned as if to\r\ninterrupt.  \"I don't know that I ought to listen to you,\" he said.\r\nBut I asked him to consider that I was a civilian, that I was in no\r\nsense an ambassador, that I brought no proposals, that he was asked\r\nto take no step whatever not even to say anything, but only to hear\r\nwhat others thought.  Upon that, I was allowed to go on.  I said my\r\nsay.  From beginning to end, General Meade listened with an impassive\r\nface.  He did not interrupt.  He never asked a question.  He never\r\nmade a {160} comment.  When I had finished I had not the least notion\r\nwhat impression my narrative had made on him; nor whether it had made\r\nany impression.  He was a model of military discretion.  Then we\r\ntalked a little about other things.  I said good-bye, rode away, and\r\nnever again saw General Meade.  But Gettysburg was the vindication of\r\nmy friends' judgment.\r\n\r\nThinking I had done all I could, I said good-bye to General Hooker,\r\nwho asked no questions, went back to New York, made a full oral\r\nreport to Mr. Gay, and asked him whether I was to write a statement\r\nfor publication.  He considered a while, then said:\r\n\r\n\"No, it is a case where the truth can do only harm.  It is not for\r\nthe public interest that the public should know the army is\r\ndemoralized, or know that Hooker must go, or know that no successor\r\nto him can yet be named.  Write an editorial, keep to generalities,\r\nand forget most of what you have told me.\"\r\n\r\nI obeyed orders.  But the orders were given forty-odd years ago.\r\nSuch interest as the matter has is now historical, and so, for the\r\nfirst time, I make public a part, and only a part, of what I learned\r\nin that month of May, 1863, on the banks of the Rappahannock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{161}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YORK DRAFT RIOTS IN 1863--NOTES ON JOURNALISM\r\n\r\nOne more battle I saw, known as the Draft Riots of 1863.  I arrived\r\nin New York on the Monday evening, and journeyed south through the\r\ncity by the light of the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum in flames; a\r\nstray negro or two hanging to a lamp-post here and there.  This was\r\nthe flank movement of the Rebellion; an attempt not only to prevent\r\nthe enforcement of the draft, which President Lincoln had too long\r\ndelayed, but to compel the Unionist forces to return northward for\r\nthe defence of their homes.  A mad scheme, yet for near four days New\r\nYork was in possession of the mob.  I never understood why, since a\r\ncouple of good regiments would at any moment have restored order, as\r\nthe event showed.  For want of them New York had to defend itself,\r\nand did it rather clumsily, enduring needless disasters and losses\r\nboth of property and life.\r\n\r\n_The Tribune_ office was marked for destruction but was armed and\r\ngarrisoned and only once did the mob effect an entrance.  Then they\r\nswept into the counting-house on the ground floor and {162} made a\r\nbonfire of such papers as they found.  For a moment there was danger,\r\nbut the police came up from the Spruce Street station, the rioters\r\nfled and the fire was put out.  Upstairs in the editorial rooms we\r\nknew nothing about it till it was all over.  Afterward a better watch\r\nwas kept.  Friends of _The Tribune_ volunteered, and there was no\r\nlack of men; nor were the police again careless.\r\n\r\nAnother rush was stopped by the police in the square.  As I sat at my\r\nwindow looking on the City Hall I saw this Rebel effort.  But the\r\npolice broke the solid mass of rioters as cleverly as it could have\r\nbeen done in Paris, where such matters are understood better than\r\nanywhere else in the world.  Once scattered, these ruffians became\r\neasy victims.  The police did not spare them.  I not only saw, but\r\nheard.  I heard the tap, tap, of the police clubs on the heads of the\r\nfugitives.  At each tap a man went down; and he did not always get up\r\nagain.  The street was strewn with the slain.\r\n\r\nWhile these incidents were occurring an effort was made to keep Mr.\r\nGreeley away from the office; partly because he was a man of peace,\r\nand we thought scenes of violence would be unpleasant to him; partly\r\nbecause he was in danger both in the office and as he came and went.\r\nBut he would listen to no appeal.  The post of danger was the Post of\r\nduty, and he stood by the ship.  Mr. Greeley's passion for peace\r\nsometimes carried him far but never showed itself in an ignoble\r\nregard for his personal safety.\r\n\r\nSydney Howard Gay's successor in the {163} managing editorship of\r\n_The Tribune_ was Mr. John Russell Young, who brought with him a new\r\nlife and freshness, and something not very far removed from a genius\r\nfor journalism: if in the profession of journalism there be room for\r\ngenius.  There is room, at any rate, for originality and for\r\nbird's-eye views of things, and for an outlook upon the world which\r\nleaves no important point uncovered.  There is room for courage and\r\nfor quickness of perception and for an intuitive knowledge of what is\r\nnews and what is not.  All these qualities Mr. Young had.  That the\r\nend of his relation with _The Tribune_ was less happy than the\r\nbeginning offers no reason, to my mind, for denying him the tribute\r\nwhich is his due.\r\n\r\nIt seems hard to believe that in 1866, in the early summer, the first\r\nnews of the Austro-Prussian war came to us in New York by ship.  But\r\nso it was.  Mr. Young walked into my room one morning with a slip of\r\npaper in his hand from the news bureau at, I think, Quarantine,\r\nannouncing the Prussian declaration of war, June 18th, and the\r\nadvance of the Prussian forces.  I should like you to take the first\r\nsteamer to Europe, remarked Mr. Young, and walked out again.  It was\r\na Monday.  The next steamer was the Cunarder _China_, from Boston to\r\nLiverpool via Queenstown, on the Wednesday.  I sailed accordingly,\r\nand on reaching Queenstown was met by a telegram announcing the\r\nAustrian defeat at Sadowa, or, as the Prussians prefer to call it,\r\nKöniggrätz, July 3rd.  The war was over.  There were other {164}\r\nmilitary operations, but an armistice was agreed to July 22nd, and\r\nthe preliminaries of peace were signed at Nikolsburg, July 26th.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, July 27th, 1866, the laying of the new Atlantic\r\ncable, the first by which messages from the public were transmitted,\r\nwas successfully completed by the _Great Eastern_, and on the 28th a\r\nfriendly message from the Queen was sent to the President of the\r\nUnited States.  The President was Mr. Andrew Johnson, and it took him\r\ntwo days to reply.  It would have made a difference to us in America\r\nif the war news of May and June could have reached us by cable.  Even\r\nsuch grave events as Austria's demand for the demobilization of the\r\nPrussian Army, so far back as April, and the proceedings in the\r\nFederal Diet at Frankfort in June, made no great impression on\r\nAmerican opinion.  I suppose we were already in that state of\r\npatriotic isolation when events in Europe seemed to us like events in\r\nan ancient world.  The Austro-Prussian conflict was not much more to\r\nmasses of Americans than the Peloponnesian War.  Nor, in truth, did\r\nnews from abroad by mail ever present itself with the suddenness and\r\nauthority it derived from the cable.  It came by mail in masses.  It\r\ncame by cable with the peremptory brevity which arrested attention.\r\nThe home telegraph was diffuse.  It was the cable which first taught\r\nus to condense.  A dispatch from London was not, in the beginning,\r\nmuch more than a flash of lightning; and went into print as it came,\r\nwithout being {165} \"written up\"; and was ten times the more\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nI had gone on from London to Berlin, and it was in Berlin that the\r\nnews came of a break in the peace negotiations and the sudden arrest\r\nof the homeward march of the Prussian troops which had begun August\r\n1st.  I sent a dispatch to _The Tribune_ announcing this, and hinting\r\nat the renewal of hostilities as a possible consequence.  The news\r\ncame from a source which was a guarantee of its truth; and true it\r\nwas.  But the diplomatic difficulty was soon adjusted and again the\r\nPrussian columns flowed steadily northward.  This message, which for\r\nthe moment was sufficiently startling, was, I think, the first news\r\ndispatch which went by cable.  It ran to near one hundred words, and\r\nthe cost of it was just short of £100, or $500.  The rate from London\r\nto New York was then twenty shillings a word.  We wasted no words at\r\nthat price.\r\n\r\nMr. Weaver was then manager of the Anglo-American Telegraph Company,\r\na man who thought it good policy to coerce the public.  He understood\r\nmuch about cable business; not much about human nature.  He\r\nconsidered himself, and for the time being he was, at the head of a\r\nmonopoly.  People who desired to send messages by cable to America\r\nmust do so upon his terms or not at all.  It never seemed to occur to\r\nhim that there might be such a thing as a prohibitory rate, or that a\r\nbusiness could not be developed to the greatest advantage by driving\r\naway customers.  He was {166} quite happy if he could wring an extra\r\nsovereign from the sender.  He thought it a good stroke to compel\r\neach sender of a message to add the word \"London\" to his signature.\r\nIt was another twenty shillings in the treasury of the company.\r\n\r\nMr. Weaver enacted many vexatious restrictive laws the discredit of\r\nwhich fell in great measure upon Mr. Cyrus Field and other directors\r\nof the Anglo-American Telegraph Company.  It was Mr. Weaver's\r\nbusiness to make rules.  It was the business of the public to obey\r\nthem.  At that time there was between the public and the\r\nAnglo-American company no direct intercourse.  We were obliged to\r\nhand in our messages over the counter of one of the two inland\r\ntelegraph companies, which between them had a monopoly; the British\r\nand Magnetic and the Electric.  Mr. Weaver sat in solitary state in\r\nTelegraph Street.  You approached his office as you would approach a\r\nshrine; a temple of some far-off deity.  During the next few years I\r\nhad often to discuss matters with Mr. Weaver, whose regulations\r\nembarrassed and delayed Press messages.  He was opposed to all\r\nconcessions to the Press.  He framed a code under which Press\r\nmessages at a reduced rate were dealt with as he chose.  He would\r\ngive us no assurance as to when he would begin or when complete the\r\ntransmission of such messages.  He would interrupt the transmission\r\nof them in a purely arbitrary way, so that the first half of a\r\nmessage might reach New York for next {167} morning's paper and the\r\nlast half for the day after.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a crisis.  I had filed an account of the\r\nOxford-Harvard four-oared race from Putney to Mortlake, a column and\r\na half long, in good time for next day's _Tribune_.  It did not\r\nappear till the day following.  I had gone with it myself to the\r\nCity, and handed in my dispatch over the counter of the British and\r\nMagnetic office in Threadneedle Street.  The office of the\r\nAnglo-American was but two minutes distant.  My inquiries about the\r\ndelay were met with civil evasions.  The Anglo- people said they sent\r\non the dispatch as soon as they got it.  The British and Magnetic\r\npeople said it had been forwarded to the Anglo- \"in the ordinary\r\ncourse of business.\"  Under that specious phrase lurked the mischief.\r\nIt came out after much pressure that, in the ordinary course of\r\nbusiness and by a rule of the Magnetic Company, every dispatch for\r\nthe cable must be copied before it was sent on to the Anglo-.  The\r\nstaff in attendance when I committed my message to the Magnetic\r\nconsisted of a boy at the counter.  It was his duty to copy the\r\ndispatch when not otherwise engaged.  He completed his copy early the\r\nnext morning.  This was finally admitted.  I then saw Mr. Weaver and\r\nput all I had to say into two sentences.  First, the delayed dispatch\r\nwould not be paid for, since it was the Anglo- which made itself\r\nresponsible for the delay by refusing to receive the message direct\r\nfrom the sender.  Second, unless this rule was abolished {168} I\r\nwould notify _The Tribune_ that it was useless to forward messages\r\nfrom London, and advise the editor to direct their discontinuance.\r\n\r\nThen came a curious thing.  Mr. Weaver having reflected on this\r\nultimatum for some thirty seconds, said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Smalley, I will agree to your proposal on one condition--that\r\nyou tell nobody you are allowed to hand in your messages to us.  We\r\ndo not intend to alter our rule.  We make an exception in your case.\"\r\n\r\nI do not suppose Mr. Weaver was aware that he was giving me a great\r\nadvantage or that he meant to give it.  But, although the copying\r\nregulation of the Magnetic was abolished, direct access to the Anglo-\r\nwas a great security and a great saving of precious time.  It was to\r\nmean in the following year of 1870 that dispatches could be sent\r\nthrough to New York as filed, and in time for the regular morning\r\nissue, which otherwise would have arrived, in whole or in part, late.\r\nIt was one among several causes to which was due the success of _The\r\nTribune_ in the early months of the Franco-German War.  The fact did\r\nnot become known in the world of journalism till some time in the\r\nlate autumn of 1870.  In February, 1870, the British Government had\r\ntaken over the inland telegraphs, and with them the duty of receiving\r\ntransatlantic dispatches.  The Government could have enforced the old\r\nrule had it chosen, but it did not choose.  The executive officer of\r\nthe Post Office was Mr. Scudamore, secretary to the {169}\r\nPostmaster-General, who had no good-will to the Press and none to me.\r\nProbably he knew nothing about the matter.  But since 1870 the cable\r\noffices have all been thrown open, or special offices opened for the\r\nreceipt of messages, and you may now file cable messages for America\r\nin any Post Office or any cable office.  The English postal telegraph\r\nservice is wonderfully good--far better than any telegraph service in\r\nAmerica--but I should never file a Press message in a postal office\r\nif within reach of a cable office.\r\n\r\nAll this is highly technical and I suppose of no interest to anybody\r\nbut journalists and telegraph managers.  But there are other\r\nexperiences which I hope may be found worth reading by a less select\r\naudience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{170}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nHOW THE PRUSSIANS AFTER SADOWA CAME HOME TO BERLIN\r\n\r\nThere is much more to say on this subject of cabling which I touched\r\non, perhaps prematurely, in the last chapter, but it can wait till\r\ncertain incidents in Berlin have been described.  Ever memorable to\r\nme was this visit to Berlin in 1866, and for two things.  I saw\r\nsomething of the two greatest forces in Prussia, or two of the three\r\ngreatest: the Prussian army and Count Bismarck.  The third, whom I\r\nsaw, but only saw, was the King; whom his grandson has since\r\nrechristened William the Great.  The Seven Weeks' War was just over.\r\nThere were Generals of the army who expected to enter Vienna in\r\ntriumph, as, four and a half years later, the German armies were to\r\nenter Paris.  But Count Bismarck had vetoed this project; by no means\r\ndesiring to leave an indelible scar of defeat and humiliation on a\r\nkindred German capital.  He wished, and the King wished, that in the\r\nfuture, and in the near future, Berlin and Vienna should be friends.\r\nIn the interest of that wise policy the purely military ambitions of\r\nthese Generals, the Red Prince perhaps among them, who were soldiers\r\nand nothing {171} else, were repressed.  A consolation was allowed\r\nthem in the shape of a triumphal re-entry into Berlin.\r\n\r\nSo on the 20th and 21st of September the garrison of Berlin and\r\nPotsdam, fifty thousand strong, but dividing their strength between\r\nthe two days, marched through the Brandenburger Gate, and up the\r\nUnter den Linden to the Opera Platz.  By good luck I had rooms in the\r\nHotel du Nord, then the best hotel in Berlin, midway in the great\r\navenue of Berlin; and being on the second floor I could look well\r\nover the trees and along almost the whole stretch of this fine\r\nstreet, a hundred yards wide.\r\n\r\nIt was such a spectacle as presents itself but seldom to the human\r\neye, German or other.  All things considered, it cannot often have\r\nbeen surpassed.  The whole world was looking on.  For here was\r\nPrussia, but three months ago a second-class European Power, which\r\nhad suddenly stepped into the front rank.  So dazzling was her rise\r\nthat the Emperor Napoleon, looking out of the Tuileries windows upon\r\na transformed Central Europe, was already demanding \"compensation\"\r\nfor Sadowa, and demanding vainly.  The leadership of Germany had\r\npassed in a night from Austria to Prussia.  The Germanic\r\nConfederation had been dissolved and the North German Confederation,\r\nwith Prussia the all-powerful head of it, had come into existence.\r\nWith the refusal of Count Bismarck to listen to the demands of\r\nNapoleon, Prussia stood out in Central Europe as the German {172}\r\nState which at last was to resist all attempts from beyond the Rhine\r\nto impose the will of a French ruler upon the German people.  It was\r\na Declaration of Independence; and of something more than\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nWhen the head of that great column of victorious troops emerged from\r\nthe great Gate, what Berlin saw was the instrument by which these\r\nvast changes had been brought about.  There were men of prophetic\r\nmind who saw in it the instrument of greater changes yet to be.  But\r\nsufficient for the day was the glory thereof.  All Berlin was in the\r\nstreets; or in this one street; or in the windows and on the\r\nhousetops of the Unter den Linden.  As they cheered I did not think\r\nthe volume of sound comparable to what one hears in London on great\r\ndays of public rejoicing.  There was rejoicing, of course, and there\r\nwas enthusiasm, but it was of the grave German kind; none the less\r\ndeep for being less resonant.  I cannot remember being much impressed\r\nby these demonstrations, nor by the flags and other decorations.  The\r\nPrussian flag, with its black and red, was a less cheerful piece of\r\nbunting than the Tricolour or the Union Jack.  The Germans have,\r\nnevertheless, ideas of ornament and of art values; perhaps mid-way\r\nbetween the French, who are supreme in such matters, and the English,\r\nwho have no ideas at all except to hang out all the flags they\r\npossess and trust to luck for harmony and effect.  None the less was\r\nthe Unter den Linden garlanded with banners, and the better houses or\r\nlarger buildings {173} were glowing with colour and contrasts.  But\r\nthe military display was the important thing, and it was magnificent.\r\n\r\nThe King came first, riding a little in front of his headquarters\r\nstaff and of the Generals who were in his suite.  Whether he might be\r\ncalled William the Great or not, he was on that day a kingly figure.\r\nThe officers with him numbered, I should think, perhaps a hundred and\r\nfifty, mostly well mounted, in uniforms which, whatever they might be\r\nsingly, were splendid in the mass.  They were perhaps too splendid.\r\nOne would have liked to see these men in the clothes in which they\r\nhad marched and fought; with the stains of war upon them.  But that,\r\nI suppose, would have been abhorrent to the German mind, and\r\nespecially to the German military mind, with its deep devotion to\r\netiquette and its worship of routine and all forms of military\r\ntechnique.  But the echoes of Austrian battlefields had not yet sunk\r\ninto silence, and we knew well enough that these were no holiday\r\nwarriors.\r\n\r\nThey rode slowly.  When the King and his staff had passed there came\r\na surprise.  The procession seemed for one moment to have come to an\r\nend.  There was an open space of perhaps fifty yards.  In the centre\r\nof it rode three men The three were: Von Roon, Minister of War;\r\nMoltke; and between them Bismarck in a white uniform as Major of\r\nCuirassiers.  It was when they came into view that the cheering rose\r\nhighest.  The King was popular and the greeting of his {174} people\r\nhad been cordial.  But the three men behind him were the real heroes.\r\nVon Roon had organized the forces of Prussia; Moltke had guided them\r\nto victory; Bismarck had planned and brought on the war.  The Carnot\r\nof Prussia; the soldier of all soldiers of Prussia next after the\r\ngreat Frederick; the brain and will and directing force of Prussia,\r\nthese three; and in all Europe no other three comparable to them,\r\nsingly or together.\r\n\r\nSo here they rode, these Three by themselves; apart, as if all that\r\nhad gone before and all that was to come after were there in homage\r\nto them.  The King and his headquarters staff were but the\r\nadvance-guard to these Three.  The five-and-twenty thousand troops\r\nwho followed were but their rear-guard.  These servants and priceless\r\npossessions of the State were encompassed about by all that was\r\nbrilliant and all that was useful in the State themselves excepted.\r\nThey bore themselves as befitted their services and their places,\r\nwith a dignity, a serene disregard of everything but their duty,\r\nwhich belong to real greatness.  Berlin hailed them with cheers of a\r\nkind which had been given to no other.  I do not know that any of the\r\nthree was precisely what might be called Popular.  Popularity was not\r\nwhat Von Roon or Moltke or Bismarck had sought.  But Berlin knew, and\r\nPrussia knew, that but for these three there would have been no day\r\nof victory for the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nThe troops came past in the formation known {175} as company front,\r\nand as the Prussian companies were a hundred strong or more, the\r\neffect was admirable.  Berlin was thronged with soldiers for days\r\nafter this, and the individual Prussian soldier was not then a very\r\nimposing object.  He was well set up, but he and his uniform were not\r\nalways on good terms; in short, he was too often slovenly or\r\nslouching.  He had, moreover, a stiffness of bearing which reminded\r\nyou of Heine's bitter account of him in earlier days; that \"he looked\r\nas if he had swallowed the ramrod with which he had been thrashed.\"\r\nBut in the mass you saw nothing slovenly, and the stiffness perhaps\r\nhelped his officers to dress that company front in a straight line\r\nacross the broad street.  The front was, in fact, perfection, and so\r\nwas the marching, and as these bodies of drilled men moved up the\r\nLinden they looked like what they had proved themselves,\r\nirresistible.  They swept on with a movement as of some great natural\r\nforce.  Regiment after regiment swung past.  There was never a break\r\nor halt.  The machine was in its best working order.  The men carried\r\ntheir heads high, crowned with victory.  And so the tide of war\r\npoured through this peaceful street.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian uniform was not a brilliant one.  In point of mere\r\ncostume these troops were not comparable to many others.  The\r\nAustrians were far more smartly dressed; and the English, and the\r\nFrench.  But this blue and red looked workmanlike, while as for\r\nornament--well, what ornament was needed beyond the word Sadowa,\r\nwhich {176} might have been, but was not, embroidered on the collars\r\nof their tunics?  You saw also that this was a citizen army: the\r\nGerman people were in these ranks, as the Prussian people.  The words\r\nhave since become almost convertible, though there are millions of\r\nGermans who will not agree to that.\r\n\r\nThe regimental officers were well enough mounted and, so far as one\r\ncould judge from a parade like this, were good horsemen.  They sat\r\nwell down in their saddles.  A good seat and good hands go together,\r\nor ought to go together, but do not always, and the hands seemed\r\nheavy if a horse turned restive.  But another thing became clear as\r\nyou looked.  The officers were of the elect.  The Prussian\r\naristocracy was in the saddle.  There has never been a time since the\r\nGreat Elector of Brandenburg when it was not in the saddle, actually\r\nand figuratively.  To adopt Bismarck's phrase at a much later day, in\r\na great speech at Jena, this country of Prussia has never been ruled\r\nfrom below.  It was not in 1866.  Nor have the Junkers and the\r\nnobility of Prussia ever failed to pay with their persons when the\r\nneed arose.  In that murderous cavalry charge at Mars-la-Tour, the\r\nranks were crowded with the sons of Princes, and Dukes, and Counts,\r\nand all the rest; they rode, no small part of them, to death, and\r\nknew they were riding to death, but no thought of rank or riches\r\nstayed them, nor did any one falter.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible not to think of these later things as the memories\r\nof these September days in 1866 come back.  I looked on then at the\r\nbeginnings {177} of what was foreordained to happen.  This was the\r\narmy, these were the very men who were to close about Sedan in that\r\nother September of 1870.  Long after that I was to see them again in\r\nthe Opera Platz and Unter den Linden when the King who now rides with\r\nhis grave gallantry of bearing at their head was to be buried, on one\r\nof the coldest and perhaps the blackest day Berlin ever saw.  The\r\nsplendour had departed.  The triumph of 1866 had given way to\r\nmourning and gloom.  And on the architrave of the Brandenburg Thor,\r\ndraped and shrouded, like all Berlin, in black, stood out in white\r\nletters the last greeting of Berlin to its old-time King, \"Vale,\r\nSenex Imperator.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{178}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA TALK WITH COUNT BISMARCK IN 1866\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nBy one of those pieces of good fortune which descend only upon the\r\nundeserving, I came to know Count Bismarck before I left Berlin.  I\r\nwas advised to present my letter at the Landtag, and as the Count was\r\nsaid to be in the House, I sent it in.  He came out to the\r\nante-chamber where I was waiting, and there for the first time I\r\nlooked into the pale blue eyes whence had flashed the lightnings that\r\nhad riven the power of Austria on the field of Sadowa.  Now they had\r\na kindly and welcoming look in them.  But, said Count Bismarck:\r\n\r\n\"I have not a moment.  A debate is on, and I am to speak at once.\r\nCome to my house in the Wilhelmstrasse at half-past ten to-night, and\r\nwe can have a talk.  Meantime you might like to hear the debate.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he called to an official to take me into the Chamber, shook hands\r\nagain, and away he went.  I heard his speech, marvelled at the sight\r\nof a Parliamentary chief in full military uniform; marvelled at the\r\ntone of authority, which also was {179} military; marvelled again at\r\nthe brevity and directness of the orator who took no thought of\r\nrhetoric and hardly cared to convince, but rather to command.  It was\r\nthe oratory of the master of many legends.  True, the four years'\r\nconflict between him and the Prussian Parliament was over, but true\r\nalso that on both Parliament and Minister that conflict had left a\r\nmark.  In his voice there was still a challenge, and in the silence\r\nof the Chamber still something sullen.  He had won.  They had lost in\r\na struggle upon which, as Herr Loewe told me, they ought never to\r\nhave entered; would never have entered had they known.  Loewe and his\r\nparty of so-called Liberals confessed themselves not only beaten but\r\nwholly in the wrong.\r\n\r\nAt half-past ten I rang at the outer door--which was more like a\r\ngate--of the palace in the Wilhelmstrasse.  It was opened by a\r\nsoldier who asked my name, and when he heard it told me I was\r\nexpected and asked me to follow him.  I was taken upstairs to a large\r\nempty room on the first floor.  In a moment out came Count Bismarck's\r\nfamous _adlatus_, Herr Lothar Bücher.  The Count was engaged with the\r\nMinister of War but if I could wait would see me presently.  I waited\r\nten minutes.  Again the door to the left opened, and forth came Von\r\nRoon, the mighty organizer of war, himself of course a soldier since\r\nin Prussia everybody who counted in affairs of State was a soldier,\r\nand still is.  You had need to visit Berlin in those warlike days to\r\nunderstand {180} what was meant by the phrase that Prussia was a\r\ncamp.  Then you had need to visit it again in time of peace to\r\nunderstand that whether in peace or war Prussia was still a camp, and\r\nas much in peace as in war.  What it is now I cannot say.  I have not\r\nbeen in Berlin these last fifteen years, but between 1866 and 1893 I\r\nwas there many times, and every time it was a camp.  The garrison of\r\nBerlin and Potsdam was never, I think, less than 40,000 men.  The\r\nstreets of Berlin were always thronged with officers, and on the\r\nbroad sidewalks of the Unter den Linden or the Friedrichstrasse there\r\nwas scarce room for anybody else.  The youngest lieutenant wanted all\r\nof it to himself.  To each other these officers were civility itself\r\nbut the civilian had no rights they were bound to respect.\r\n\r\nI had already seen something of this all-pervading military spirit\r\nand military supremacy, and sat reflecting on it in this great\r\n_salon_ where I waited for Count Bismarck to be at leisure.  When\r\nHerr von Roon came out he recognized me, I suppose, as a stranger,\r\nand, civilian though I was, gave me the greeting he thought due to\r\nCount Bismarck's guest, which I returned.  There was almost a halt as\r\nhe strode past; his face was turned to me, and I could read in it the\r\nstern record of a long conflict; of vast responsibilities and years\r\nof unceasing toil; a rugged face enough but the light of victory in\r\nhis eye.  He, too, had fought and won.  Curiously enough, among the\r\nmen I met at that time in Berlin, the man who, {181} Bismarck\r\nexcepted, seemed to have most of the statesman in him, with the\r\nstatesman's civic virtues and traits, was this Minister of War.  Not\r\nbecause he was Minister in the sense in which an English Secretary of\r\nState for War is Minister.  The English War Minister is never a\r\nsoldier; he is a Parliamentary chief, and his authority over the army\r\ndenotes the supremacy of Parliament over the whole military hierarchy\r\nfrom commander-in-chief down to the drummer boy.\r\n\r\nBut of Parliamentary supremacy there had been for these last four\r\nyears in Prussia none whatever.  The Minister of War was not\r\nresponsible to Parliament; he never has been; he is not now.  He was\r\nthen responsible to the King of Prussia, as he is now to the German\r\nEmperor.  When, in May, 1863, the Chamber protested to the King that\r\nthe attitude of the Ministry to Parliament was arbitrary and\r\nunconstitutional (as it was), the King made answer that the Ministry\r\npossessed his confidence, and sent the Parliament about its business.\r\nThat is, he prorogued Parliament, announced that he would govern for\r\nthe present without a Parliament; and as matters did not mend and the\r\nChamber again in December refused to vote a war budget, the King\r\ndissolved it.  Parliamentary government existed at that time in\r\nPrussia under the constitution, but in name only.\r\n\r\nThese reflections were cut short by the reopening of the door, and\r\nCount Bismarck entered.  {182} Still in uniform, nor did I ever see\r\nhim except in uniform, whether in public or private, till I visited\r\nhim in his home at Friedrichsruh in 1893, where he wore a black\r\nfrock-coat and black trousers, crowned, when he went out, by a soft,\r\nbroad-brimmed grey felt hat, quite shapeless.  He had, more than any\r\nman I ever met, the manner of the _grand seigneur_, in which\r\ndistinction of bearing and a grave, even gentle, courtesy went\r\ntogether.  He was sorry, he said, to have kept me waiting, \"but the\r\nbusiness of the State, you know, comes first, and though one crisis\r\nis over another succeeds, and we know not yet what the end is to be.\"\r\nThis I understood to refer not to Austria, for the Treaty of Prague\r\nhad been signed in August, but to France, where the Emperor was\r\nbrooding over his lost prestige and lost hold on Southern Germany,\r\nand was meditating demands which might compensate him for the loss of\r\nthe power of meddling with matters which were none of his business.\r\n\r\nAs he said this we walked into his private room, or cabinet, the very\r\ncentre of the spider's web; a comfortable, plain, workmanlike little\r\nroom; a writing-desk the chief piece of furniture, large enough to\r\nfill the whole of the further corner; a sideboard opposite, a small\r\ntable with ash trays, a few chairs, and that was all.  The curtains\r\nwere drawn; the room, German fashion, seemed a trifle close, and as\r\nif old Frederick William's Tobacco Parliament had been held here all\r\nthese last hundred and fifty years or more.  There was a rug in the\r\ncentre which had to do duty for {183} the carpet which in Germany, as\r\nelsewhere on the Continent, never covers the whole floor.\r\n\r\nAs we were sitting down, the Count behind his desk, a door opened,\r\nopposite to the one by which we had entered, and there appeared a\r\nlady whom I had never seen; the Countess Bismarck.  When she saw me\r\nshe said to her husband:\r\n\r\n\"You have not been in bed for three nights.  I hope you don't mean to\r\nsit up again.\"\r\n\r\nOf course I rose, saying, \"At any rate, he shall not sit up for me.\"\r\nBut the Count laughed, came out from behind his desk, took me by the\r\nshoulders, thrust me down into the chair again, all with an air of\r\nkindly authority not easy to describe, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Sit where you are.  I want to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\nAs I thought it over afterward I supposed Count Bismarck had some\r\nobject in mind other than the pleasure of my conversation.  He knew\r\nthat I was the representative of _The Tribune_; my letter to him had\r\nstated that.  He knew what the position and power of _The Tribune_\r\nwere, and especially of its influence with the Germans in America.\r\nAnd it seemed to me that, in view of the relations between the\r\nGermans at home and the Germans beyond the seas, he thought it might\r\nbe worth while that his view of the situation should be put before\r\nthe Germans in America, and before the Americans also, in an\r\nauthentic though not an authoritative way.  Count Bismarck did not\r\nsay that.  It was my conjecture, {184} upon which I acted to a\r\ncertain extent as I will explain more fully by and by.\r\n\r\nCountess Bismarck looked on at this performance which she plainly did\r\nnot like, but presently smiled and said to her husband: \"Well, if you\r\nwill sit up you must have something to drink,\" went to the sideboard,\r\nmixed a brandy and soda, took it to him, put the glass to his lips,\r\nand stood by him to see that he drank the whole, which he did with no\r\nvisible reluctance.  He handed the empty tumbler to his wife and\r\nthanked her.  She put her arm about him, kissed him, looked at me\r\nreproachfully but amiably, and vanished.  A truly domestic, truly\r\nGerman, altogether charming little scene.\r\n\r\nMany years later, after Count Bismarck had become Prince Bismarck and\r\na greater figure in Germany than the world had seen, I met Princess\r\nBismarck again at a dinner in Homburg given by Mr. William Walter\r\nPhelps, American Minister at Berlin.  Mr. Phelps had long been a\r\nfriend of the Bismarck family and on easy terms with the head of that\r\nfamily, who liked and respected him.  It was a case of sympathy\r\nbetween opposites.  No contrast could be more complete than the\r\ncontrast between Prince Bismarck and Mr. Phelps; but their relations\r\nwere, as so often happens, all the more friendly for that reason.  I\r\nwas presented to the Princess, and after dinner inquired whether she\r\nremembered this midnight incident in the Wilhelmstrasse.  She asked\r\nme to describe it, and I told her what had happened.  She had wholly\r\n{185} forgotten it.  I asked her if I might some day narrate the\r\nstory.  \"I don't see why you shouldn't,\" she answered.  Years after\r\nthat I again saw the Princess at Friedrichsruh, and she asked whether\r\nI had ever repeated my tale.  I said no, but that I still meant to\r\navail myself of her permission, as I now do.\r\n\r\nThe Princess thought, I imagine, she would like to see the Prince\r\nportrayed in this intimate way and in this relation to his wife.  Her\r\nlife had always been lived in and for his.  She knew well what the\r\nworld thought; to the world he was always the Iron Chancellor.  But\r\nin private life he was the affectionate loyal husband to whom one\r\nwoman had devoted all she had--all her love, truth, worship--an\r\nadoration which perhaps not many men have deserved or received from\r\nany woman.\r\n\r\nThere is much in Bismarck's _Love Letters_--which are hardly love\r\nletters--about his wife and much in other Bismarck books, notably in\r\nSidney Whitman's _Personal Reminiscences_, the best of them all.  The\r\nPrincess will ever live as an amiable figure, and if she had not been\r\nthat would still live as the wife of the one great German of his\r\ntime; as the woman who had known how to captivate a fancy once\r\nsupposed to be wayward, and to make it and him her own.  The quality\r\nwhich distinguished her was sweetness or nature, which she never lost\r\nduring a life harassed by many solicitudes and vexed by illness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{186}\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Countess von Bismarck having departed out of the little room, the\r\nKing's Minister plunged at once into his subject, which was nothing\r\nless than the history of the last four years during which he had\r\nruled over Prussia.  Much of what he said I repeated in _The Tribune_\r\nno very long time after.  All that he said, or all that I could\r\nremember, I put down in writing that night before I slept.  It\r\ncontained, however, so much that obviously was not meant for print\r\nand could never be printed that, after using as much as I thought\r\ncould properly be published, I destroyed my manuscript.  I had said\r\nto Count Bismarck as I left that he knew he had been talking to a\r\njournalist and yet had said many things he could not wish made known\r\nto the public.  He laughed and answered: \"Well, it is your business\r\nto distinguish.\"\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, still my business to distinguish.  I may perhaps\r\nsay a little more than I could while both the Emperor and the Prince\r\nwere alive, but not much.  For, in truth, I have never quite\r\nunderstood why confidences cease to be confidences because those who\r\nimparted them or those whom they concern are dead.  A man who quits\r\nthis world leaves his reputation, if he has any, behind him.\r\nIndiscretions may affect his memory as they might have affected his\r\nliving fame.  In this case they would exalt Count Bismarck's fame;\r\nbut it might be at the expense of others whom he had {187} no desire\r\nto belittle.  So I keep for the most part to generalities.\r\n\r\nOf the King he spoke with astonishing freedom, yet never a word to\r\ninjure the sovereign whom he served.  I will quote once more a\r\nsentence I have repeated before now:\r\n\r\n\"You are a Republican, and you cannot fully understand the loyalty I\r\ncherish to a King to whose ancestors my ancestors have been loyal for\r\nhundreds of years.\"\r\n\r\nYet it comes to this--and of this truth History has long since taken\r\naccount--that between Count Bismarck and his august master there was\r\na long-continuing conflict.  If the King had won there would have\r\nbeen no Austro-Prussian War, nor any Franco-German War, nor any\r\nGerman Confederation, nor any Germany as we know Germany to-day.\r\nWhen, therefore, the present German Emperor puts forward his\r\ngrandfather as the author of these changes, he is making for his\r\ngrandfather a false claim.  While he was still Prince William of\r\nPrussia he said:\r\n\r\n\"Whenever I hear a great event in my grandfather's reign discussed I\r\nnever hear his name mentioned, but always Bismarck's.  When I come to\r\nthe throne it is my name you will hear as the author of the policies\r\nand deeds of my reign.\"\r\n\r\nWilliam the Second has kept that pledge, but that is no reason why he\r\nshould try to rewrite the history of his grandfather's time or to rob\r\nPrince Bismarck of the renown which belongs to him and {188} which\r\nthe world awards him.  Powerful as he is, he is not powerful enough\r\nfor that.\r\n\r\nThis is a digression, but it will serve to bring out the main fact\r\nthat there was a contest between the King and Bismarck in 1866, and\r\nthat not the King but Bismarck came out triumphant.  In the long war\r\nwith Parliament the King and his Minister were together, and the King\r\nwas as loyal to his Minister as the Minister was to the King.  But\r\nwhen the critical moment came it still has to be said that Bismarck's\r\nwas the seeing eye and the deciding voice, and his, not the King's,\r\nwas the directing mind.\r\n\r\nOver the heads of the Parliament and people of Prussia, and against\r\nthe wish of the King, who only at the last moment and by one last\r\nargument had been persuaded to consent, did Bismarck pursue his way.\r\n\r\n\"It was not,\" said Bismarck, \"till I had convinced the King that his\r\nhonour as a soldier was involved that he would agree to the war with\r\nAustria.  No political argument moved him.  The vision of a united\r\nGermany with himself at the head of a German Confederation did not\r\ndazzle him.\r\n\r\n\"'Austria is my brother,' he said; 'the war would be fratricidal.\r\nThe Emperor and I are bound together by many ties, by many interests;\r\nabove all by affection and by loyalty.  I should think it treacherous\r\nto attack a sovereign who has given me many proofs of good-will and\r\nto I have given pledges.  Nothing will induce to do it.'\"\r\n\r\n{189}\r\n\r\n\"Yet,\" continued Bismarck, \"he had allowed me to take step after\r\nstep, each one of which led inevitably to war.  In the long conflict\r\nwith the Parliament he was with me.  Only by his support was that\r\nconflict maintained or victory possible.  No money was voted for four\r\nyears.  We laid hands on the public revenues, but the Government had\r\nto be carried on in part by money supplied out of that Royal Treasure\r\nFund which for generations the Kings of Prussia have hoarded for\r\nkingly purposes.  The preparations for war were nourished from the\r\nsame source.  The war with Denmark was paid for to a certain extent\r\nout of the same royal purse.  The Landtag never assented to the\r\nSchleswig-Holstein enterprise nor would vote a solitary thaler to\r\ncarry it on.  Before that, when I became Minister, in September,\r\n1862, my first act was to announce to the Chamber that I proposed to\r\ngovern without a budget.  The Chamber protested against that as\r\nunconstitutional, which of course it was.  Six months later the\r\nChamber invited the King to dismiss his Ministers.  He replied that\r\nhis Ministers had his confidence, and a week later instead of\r\ndismissing us announced that he proposed to govern without a\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\"All this time I was preparing for war with Austria after Denmark.\r\nThe King must have known what it all meant, but he did not stay his\r\nhand nor withdraw his confidence from us.  After the peace with\r\nDenmark there was no longer any reason for military preparations\r\nexcept Austria.  {190} But the King still allowed me to go on.  In\r\nJanuary, 1865, the Parliament again rejected the public budget.  The\r\nKing rejoined by seizing on the public revenues in the name of the\r\nState.  The public knew nothing of what I had in mind.  The\r\nParliament knew nothing.  If it had been possible to take Parliament\r\ninto my confidence the budget would have been voted.  The Liberals\r\nhave admitted that.  But to take Parliament into my confidence would\r\nhave been to take Austria into my confidence.  It could not be.  It\r\nwas necessary to strike suddenly; to strike before Austria could\r\nassemble her reserves, or take advantage of her immense resources, or\r\nbring into line all the discordant races of that great Empire.\r\n\r\n\"How much did I tell the King?  Well, as much as was necessary for\r\nthe time being.  The great struggle with His Majesty was put off till\r\nthe moment of conflict was near; till it was necessary to throw off\r\nthe mask.  Besides, you must consider that I had to deal not only\r\nwith the King but with the various Court influences which surrounded\r\nhim.  They were almost all hostile to me.  Many of them were very\r\npowerful with the King.  I might spend six weeks in coaxing him to\r\nassent to a particular measure.  When he had promised, in would come\r\nsome Grand Duchess and in half an hour undo my six weeks' work.\"\r\n\r\nI interrupt the flow of this speech to remark that, long after this,\r\nPrince Bismarck repeated to the same complaint about grand ducal\r\ninterventions.  They never ceased.  They were never {191} relaxed.\r\nThere was no conciliating these great personages.  They had policies\r\nand purposes of their own, which were never those of Germany but\r\nalways of some German principality with which their personal\r\ninterests were bound up.  There is nothing so selfish as a\r\nsecond-class Royalty; a Serenity with a dukedom which a\r\npocket-handkerchief would cover.\r\n\r\nBismarck continued:\r\n\r\n\"In the end Austria played my game for me.  She demanded in April,\r\n1866, the demobilization of the Prussian forces, which had begun to\r\nput themselves on a war footing in March.  Then I knew the Lord had\r\ndelivered her into our hands.  I laid the demand before the King,\r\nsaying: 'I do not know whether Your Majesty is prepared to surrender\r\nthe command of your army to your brother of Austria.'  He took fire\r\nat once.  Then it was that he felt his honour as a soldier was\r\nattacked.  From that moment the difficulty was to restrain him.  We\r\nwere not quite ready.  It would have been dangerous to declare war at\r\nonce.  It was dangerous, perhaps, to let the moment of the King's\r\nanger pass, lest counsels of peace should again prevail.  But one\r\nrisk or the other had to be taken, and I chose the latter.  Two\r\nmonths later, June 18th, war was declared, and the King issued a\r\nmanifesto to his people which was everything that could be wished.\r\nAll the rest was in the hands of the God of Battles.\"\r\n\r\nThen a pause and a piercing glance, then on he went:\r\n\r\n{192}\r\n\r\n\"After Königgrätz there were the same difficulties.  The King could\r\nnot at first understand why this career of victory was to be\r\ninterrupted.  He was King no longer.  He was Field Marshal,\r\ncommanding the forces of Prussia.  He had won a great battle.  The\r\npower of Austria was broken.  Vienna lay at his mercy.  Germany was\r\nwaiting to know whether Austria or Prussia was to be her future\r\nmaster--well, no, not master, but which of the two was to be the\r\nchief State in Germany and the true leader of the German people.\r\nWhat other sign of supremacy could be so visible, so convincing, as\r\nthe Prussian armies in Vienna, Prussian troops encamped in the\r\nPrater, the Danube bridled and bridged by us Prussians?  When an\r\nenemy's capital lay at the victor's mercy, why should he not enter\r\nit?  What great soldier ever refrained?\r\n\r\n\"Thus,\" said Bismarck, \"spoke the King.  I ventured to remind His\r\nMajesty of his reluctance to make war on the Emperor of Austria, and\r\nto ask whether, now that he was vanquished, he wished him to be\r\nhumiliated also.  That seemed to touch him.  We talked long.  He was\r\nsurrounded by generals and princes who urged him on, but in the end\r\nhe came round to my view which had been his own view before the war.\r\nSo here we are in Berlin and not in Vienna, and please God we shall\r\nall be friends again, and some day there will be one Germany and not\r\ntwo, or twenty, or fifty, as in times past and to-day.  The fruits of\r\nour triumph are yet to gather.\"\r\n\r\n{193}\r\n\r\nTwice during this discourse I had risen to go, but Bismarck said:\r\n\"No, I have not finished.\"  The third time, it was long past one\r\no'clock, and I said: \"If I don't go now Countess Bismarck will never\r\nlet me see you again.\"  This amused him, and he remarked: \"I suppose\r\nyou think I am getting sleepy!\"  But sleepy he was not.  He had\r\ntalked for near two hours with unquenchable energy and freshness, and\r\nwith a force of speech in which no man was his rival.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{194}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nAMERICAN DIPLOMACY IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe Ministers and Ambassadors who have represented the United States\r\nin England have an interest individually and as a body.  So long a\r\nline of men, mostly distinguished, is almost a dynasty.  Some of them\r\nare totally forgotten.  Some are remembered faintly.  Some have left\r\na lasting impression.  I have known a round dozen of them.  The\r\npublic memory is short.  If I say that to Mr. Charles Francis Adams\r\nit was permitted to do a greater service to his country abroad than\r\nto any American since Franklin--or since his grandfather, John Adams,\r\nwho might perhaps as a diplomatist be ranked above Franklin--if I say\r\nthis, there are Americans to whom it will seem doubtful.  But since\r\nAdams's greater service consisted in a just menace of war to England\r\nif she let loose the Alexandra, the current histories, written in\r\ndays when every act of hostility to England was applauded, right or\r\nwrong, have done him justice.  He was right, a thousand times right,\r\nand we cannot remember it too often.\r\n\r\n{195}\r\n\r\nBut what Americans ought also to remember is this, that when Mr.\r\nAdams flung his glove in Lord Russell's face it was done neither from\r\ntemper nor impulse.  It was the considered act of a Minister who had\r\nweighed all the chances, who had made up his mind that open war was\r\nbetter than covert hostility, and that it belonged to him to accept\r\nthe responsibility.  Whether Mr. Seward would have backed up his\r\nMinister may be a question, had the Minister's \"This means war\" been\r\nmet by Lord Russell with \"Then war it is.\"  But the British\r\nGovernment knew--even Lord Palmerston knew--they were in the wrong;\r\nand they gave way.  But they gave way only because Mr. Adams had put\r\nthe alternative of war before them.  It was very far from being his\r\nonly service or his only triumph, but it was the greatest of all.\r\n\r\nIt is not too much to say that the diplomatic fortunes of the United\r\nStates were in the hands of the American Minister to Great Britain\r\nfrom 1861 to 1863; and, indeed, to the end of the Civil War.  A weak\r\nman, or an incompetent Minister, would have brought us to the dust.\r\nAdams, of course, was neither.  He was a match for anybody in his\r\nbusiness as Minister.  He had the intellectual qualities and he had\r\nthe personal qualities.  Moreover, he was an Adams.  He belonged to\r\nthe governing classes, to one of the few great American families in\r\nwhom the traditions and gifts of government are hereditary.  The\r\nphilosopher who divided the population of Massachusetts into {196}\r\nmen, women, and Adamses made a strictly scientific distribution.  The\r\nAdamses were of that minority which, under one name or another and in\r\nall countries alike, governs.  It governs none the less when it sees\r\nfit to allow the democracy to believe itself all-powerful than when\r\nit takes command as an aristocracy.\r\n\r\nI knew Mr. Adams.  Mr. R. H. Dana, Jr., who smoothed so many paths\r\nfor me, gave me a letter to him.  This was in 1867.  The days of\r\ntumult and conflict were over.  His great work was done, but he\r\nremained Minister till 1868.  The legation was then in Portland\r\nPlace.  Mr. Moran was Secretary of Legation; an excellent official\r\nwhose service in that position in London lasted seventeen years, and\r\nwas finally rewarded by promotion to Lisbon as Minister.  He was a\r\ngood watchdog.  A secretary, of whatever rank, has to be that.  Like\r\nHoratius, he has to keep the bridge, albeit, against his own\r\ncountrymen.  They are the Volscians.  When I asked to see Mr. Adams\r\nMr. Moran very properly wished to know why, and when I produced Mr.\r\nDana's letter Mr. Moran seemed to think it was addressed to him, and\r\nnot till I had explained that it was Mr. Dana's, who was Mr. Adams's\r\nfriend, and that I had no other business than to present this letter,\r\ndid Mr. Moran's vigilance relax.  We became friends afterwards.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the Minister he departed a little from his official\r\nmanner, greeted me kindly, and said: \"You have brought me a very\r\nstrong letter.  What can I do for you?\"  When I thanked him {197} and\r\nsaid I wanted nothing, he relaxed a little further, laughed a little,\r\nand observed that most of his countrymen who called at the legation\r\nhad an object.  He talked with a singular precision; his was a mind\r\nof precision, like the modern rifle, equally good at short range and\r\nlong if you adjust the sights.  But good as was his talk, what\r\nimpressed you most was the silent power of the man; the force in\r\nreserve, the solidity and the delicate temper of the metal.\r\n\r\nI dwell a moment on the relations between travelling Americans and\r\ntheir legation or embassy--which to the untravelled may seem\r\nunimportant--because, now as much as ever and perhaps more than ever,\r\nthe duties of a Minister, of an Ambassador, of the embassy, are so\r\noften misunderstood by that portion of the public from America which\r\nis intent on immediate admission to Buckingham Palace.  I have known\r\nmany secretaries since Mr. Moran's time.  They have been, as a rule,\r\nwilling and competent, really desirous to be of service to their\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nThere is no other embassy than the American on which such demands are\r\nmade as on ours in London and in Paris, and to some extent in other\r\ncapitals.  These demands are addressed first of all to the Ambassador\r\nor Ambassadress.  I will take a single instance.  There is each year\r\na large number of Americans who desire to be presented at Court, and\r\nwho think it the duty of the Ambassador to arrange for their\r\npresentation.  Many of these applications are sent by {198} letter\r\nwell in advance of their coming.  There are hundreds of such\r\napplications--literally hundreds; four or five hundred this year from\r\nAmerican ladies who thought themselves, and were, worthy to appear\r\nbefore the King and Queen at one of the three Courts presently to be\r\nheld.  The number of presentations which the Ambassadress is entitled\r\nto make at each of the three Courts is four.  That is a rule, an\r\nordinance of the King who has the sole authority in such matters.\r\nSometimes, in some special case, upon reason assigned, the rule is\r\nrelaxed and a presentation may be made outside of it.  But all such\r\nrequests are rigidly scrutinized and the margin is very narrow.  The\r\nexceptions are units.\r\n\r\nIn these circumstances, with four hundred candidates for four\r\npresentations, what is an unhappy Ambassadress to do?  The American,\r\nused to the easy ways prevailing at the White House, supposes they\r\nmust be equally easy at Buckingham Palace; or that, upon a word from\r\nthe American Ambassador, in these days of pleasant Anglo-American\r\nrelations, all doors will fly open.  If they do not, each one of the\r\nfour hundred regards hers, as a case for exceptional favour.  She has\r\ncome three thousand or four or six thousand miles in order to lend\r\nthe distinction of her republican presence to these royal functions.\r\nWhat is an Ambassador for if not to give effect to these good\r\nintentions?  The Lord Chamberlain stands at the door with a drawn\r\nsword, but is an American Ambassador to be intimidated by a mere\r\nofficer of the Royal {199} Household?  It is in vain to answer that\r\neven a King has a right to say whom he can receive and whom he\r\ncannot.  _Le charbonnier est maître chez soi_, but not, they think,\r\nthe King of England.\r\n\r\nThe perplexities arising out of this American eagerness to witness\r\nthese royal splendours are innumerable.  The resentment arising out\r\nof inevitable refusals is a burden which every Ambassador has to\r\nbear; and every secretary too.  Grievances are of many kinds.  It is\r\nnot so many years since an American Minister was asked by\r\ncable--almost ordered--by a distinguished fellow-countryman to engage\r\nlodgings for him in London.  It is not many more since an eminent\r\nstatesman, arriving after Levees and Drawing-rooms were over, desired\r\na secretary to arrange that he and his family should take tea with\r\nthe Queen at Windsor Castle.\r\n\r\nThese are cases occurring not in musical comedy but in actual life.\r\nThere are others, relating not to royalty but to society, and to\r\nvarious forms of English life.  But it is already only too evident\r\nthat the diplomatic duties of an Ambassador are not his only\r\nanxieties.  The others, so far as I know anything about them, have\r\nalways been borne cheerfully.  Everything has been done for the\r\nAmerican in London that could be done.  He is taken care of to an\r\nextent that the Briton abroad never is, nor ever expects to be.  But\r\nto all human effort there is a limit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{200}\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMR. JOHN LOTHROP MOTLEY\r\n\r\nSince Mr. Adams's retirement in 1868 we have had three Ambassadors\r\nwhose ability as diplomatists entitles them to places in the front\r\nrank.  If you take account of other kinds of ability and of\r\nMinisters, there are more than three.  Mr. Motley was a brilliant\r\nhistorian whose \"Rise of the Dutch Republic\" and \"History of the\r\nUnited Netherlands\" gave him a lasting European reputation and added\r\ndistinction to American literature.  But neither his six years of\r\nservice as Minister to Austria, 1861-7, nor his year and a half in\r\nEngland, 1869-70, proved him a great diplomatist.\r\n\r\nAustria was not then, and is not now, of the first importance from an\r\nAmerican point of view.  We respect her wise old Emperor.  We do not,\r\nI think, agree with Mr. Gladstone in saying you can nowhere put your\r\nfinger on the map and say, \"Here Austrian rule has been beneficent.\"\r\nShe never was a model to us and is not now.  But since we like\r\ncourage, and clear-sighted decision, and the recognition of facts,\r\nand like the men who have these gifts, we have not joined very\r\nheartily in the European outcry against the Austrian annexation of\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.  We are a world-power for certain purposes\r\nonly.  We stand aloof from purely European complications.  They are,\r\nas a rule, no affair of ours.  We learned to our cost, or possibly\r\nour mortification, not very {201} long ago, that Austria, \"effete\" or\r\nnot, was capable of giving us a lesson in diplomacy; or, at least, in\r\ndiplomatic etiquette; by which we, or our late President, may or may\r\nnot have profited.\r\n\r\nMr. Motley, though he wrote excellent dispatches and made no\r\ndiplomatic or social mistakes in that difficult Austrian capital, had\r\nnot the smooth temper or the patient arts which are essential to\r\nsuccess at critical moments.  He was impetuous, explosive,\r\nrhetorical; prone to interpret his instructions in the light of his\r\nown wishes or convictions.  Socially he was a force, even in Vienna,\r\nbecause of his personal charm, his distinction of appearance and of\r\nmanner.  Socially speaking, he was an aristocrat.  He was the first\r\nAmerican Minister in London to establish himself in a house suitable\r\nto the dignity of the post, Lord Yarborough's, in Arlington Street.\r\nHe was known to be Count Bismarck's friend.  That of itself gave him\r\na kind of celebrity, for Count Bismarck was then a comparatively\r\nunfamiliar personage in England, where the outlook of the average man\r\non the Continental horizon is not wide.\r\n\r\nOne of the first questions Count Bismarck asked me when I first\r\ntalked with him in the Wilhelmstrasse in 1866 was whether I knew\r\nMotley.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to Vienna?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then of course you will see Motley.  Be sure you give him a message\r\nfrom me--a warm message.  I have never forgotten our university days\r\n{202} together at Göttingen; our friendship.  He knows that, but tell\r\nhim again.  And tell him I hope to see him in Berlin before he goes\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, there came into the eyes of the Iron Chancellor a look I\r\nhad not seen before.  The steel-blue softened into the blue of the\r\nskies; after rain, as the Chinese say.  His friendship for Motley was\r\nan affectionate friendship.  Later, I talked with Motley about\r\nBismarck and of course delivered my message.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Motley, \"we were boys together at Göttingen.  His was a\r\ndifferent life from mine.  I dare say you have heard the stories\r\nabout young Bismarck's exploits.  In those matters he was like most\r\nstudents of his time and of his class.  The Prussian Junker is a\r\nbeing by himself.  But we became friends, and friends we have\r\nremained.  We don't meet often, but the friendship has never died out\r\nnor decayed.\"\r\n\r\nAnother thing made Motley far otherwise popular in England; his\r\npassionate Americanism.  Mr. Price Collier is of opinion that\r\nEnglishmen do not like Americans.  I do not agree with Mr. Collier,\r\nbut, whether they do or not, they like an American to be an American.\r\nThey liked Mr. Motley because his patriotism burst forth in all\r\ncompanies and at all times.  It made him, or tended to make him,\r\nreluctant to compromise on any question where the interests of his\r\ncountry were concerned.  But compromise is of the essence of\r\ndiplomacy; most of all as between the greatest Powers of the World.\r\nIf nobody ever yielded {203} anything, negotiations could end only in\r\nsurrender or in war; the two things which it is the business of\r\ndiplomacy to avoid.  Nothing Motley ever did in diplomacy was of such\r\nservice to his country as his two letters to _The Times_, early in\r\nthe Civil War, and his memorable outburst in the Athenæum Club.  To\r\nwrite the letters he violated the unwritten law of diplomacy, for he\r\nwas then Minister to Austria.  To make the Athenæum speech--for it\r\nwas nothing less--he departed from the other unwritten law which\r\nmakes a club neutral ground, and makes anything like an oration\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nBut Motley had among other qualities the quality of courage.  His\r\ninvective in the Athenæum against the very classes among whose\r\nrepresentatives he stood was magnificent, and it came very near being\r\nwar, or a declaration of war.  He would keep no terms with the men\r\nwho were enemies of his country in such a crisis as that.  If it had\r\nbeen anybody but Motley who thundered against the ignorance and\r\nprejudice of the Confederate allies who then gave the tone to English\r\nsociety, I imagine the Committee of the Club might have taken notice.\r\nBut Motley fascinated while he rebuked.  When he had done denouncing\r\nthem as renegades to English ideas and enemies to liberty, they liked\r\nhim the better.  I can think of no incident so like this as\r\nPlimsoll's defiance of the House of Commons, when he rushed into the\r\nmiddle of the floor and charged his fellow-members with sacrificing\r\nthe lives of English {204} sailors to the cupidity of English\r\nship-owners, and so compelled the House to adopt the load-line.\r\n\r\nHistory has taken note of Plimsoll's exploit.  Motley's may never\r\nappear in pages which aim at historical dignity.  But to this day,\r\nwhen near half a century has passed, Motley's is still remembered;\r\nstill spoken of; still admired.  There are men living who heard him.\r\nThe English do not entirely like being reminded of their mistakes\r\nabout us at that period, but they bear no malice against the man\r\nwhose admonition did much to bring them to their senses.  On the\r\ncontrary, through all these forty-odd years, you might have heard\r\nMotley spoken of with admiring good-will.\r\n\r\nBefore all things, he loved his own country.  Next to his own\r\ncountry, _longo intervallo_, he loved England, and it may be doubted\r\nwhether we have ever sent a Minister, or anybody else to England whom\r\nthe English themselves have loved as they loved Motley.  His deep\r\nblue eyes shine starlike across all that interval of years.  He\r\ncarried his head high.  His stature was well above the usual stature\r\nof men.  In all companies he was conspicuous for beauty and for his\r\nbearing.  And from the confusion and forgetfulness of that crowded\r\nperiod he still emerges, a living force, a brilliant memory; an\r\nAmerican, as Dean Stanley said of him, \"in whom the aspirations of\r\nAmerica and the ancient culture of Europe were united.\"\r\n\r\nThere is supposed to be still a mystery about his recall by President\r\nGrant.  But it is an open-air {205} mystery.  Grant struck at Sumner\r\nthrough Motley.  Any weapon was thought good enough to beat Sumner\r\nwith.  Motley was his friend, Sumner had made him Minister.  It was\r\ndeemed possible to humiliate Sumner and to teach him a lesson.  The\r\ninterests of the country were not allowed to stand in the way of this\r\nhigh purpose, and so Motley went.  Or rather, he did not go.  Asked\r\nto resign in July, 1870, he disregarded that request.  Grant\r\nhesitated; or perhaps Mr. Fish, then Secretary of State, hesitated.\r\nBut in November of the same year, Motley was recalled; an act without\r\nprecedent and happily never repeated.  No charges were made.  There\r\nwere none to make.  Motley's diplomatic record, his personal\r\ncharacter, were spotless.  The childish scandal started at Vienna\r\nnever had a rag of evidence to support it; nor anything behind it but\r\nanonymous personal animosity.  His departure from England left no\r\nstain upon anybody except upon President Grant, and upon such\r\nofficers and Ministers of his as stooped to be the instruments of his\r\nill-will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTWO MINISTERS AND TWO AMBASSADORS\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell may be compared with Mr. Motley as an example of our\r\nAmerican method of appointing Ministers who not only are not--for\r\nthey could not be--trained diplomats, but whose character is\r\nessentially undiplomatic.  Mr. Motley was, however, so much more a\r\nman of the world {206} than Mr. Lowell that they cannot be bracketed.\r\nThere is a similarity but no identity.  Until Lowell came to London\r\nhe was a recluse.  Motley had never been that.  Lowell had been a\r\nprofessor in Harvard University.  Motley, though a student and\r\nhistorian, was not what the English call \"Donnish,\" whereas Lowell\r\nhad often the air of lecturing the company, as if a company of\r\npupils.  Delightful as his talk was, the touch of the pedagogue was\r\nthere.  Indeed, it may be doubted whether life in a university, which\r\nis a world by itself, is ever a good training for diplomacy.  An\r\nAmbassador ought to be a man of the world--it is perhaps the first\r\nand highest of his qualifications--but not a man of a world.  A\r\nthorough knowledge of the Greek aorist or of the proceedings of\r\nAntigonus in Asia Minor is not needed in the conduct of delicate\r\nnegotiations; nor did Lowell find his familiarity with Spanish\r\nliterature of much use at the Foreign Office, or in that larger\r\nforeign office known as English Society.\r\n\r\nSociety was to Lowell in the beginning of his English experiences a\r\nstumbling-block; and to the end he only too often made a misstep.  He\r\nwas liked all the same.  The English are a people who can make\r\nallowances, nor do they expect a non-Englishman to be cast in an\r\nEnglish mould.  They recognized his positive merits.  They did not\r\ndwell on what they thought defects.  I suppose I have before now told\r\nwhat I always thought a characteristic saying of an English host, as\r\nLowell drove away from his door:\r\n\r\n{207}\r\n\r\n\"I need not tell you how much I like Lowell and how delighted I am to\r\nhave him here as often as he will come.  But from the moment he\r\nenters my house till he is gone I am in a panic.\"\r\n\r\nThe panic into which this genial host fell was due to Lowell's\r\nfighting spirit; surely not the spirit of a diplomatist.  To that and\r\nto a passion for accuracy which he allowed to become pedantic and\r\naggressive.  He left behind him a path strewn with victims; a renown\r\nfor brilliancy; a just repute for many amiable and delightful traits.\r\nBut the qualities essential to a Minister were not among them.\r\n\r\nMr. E. J. Phelps, who came after him, was a lawyer, and a lawyer may\r\nperhaps be expected to be more combative than a professor; but it was\r\nnot so.  Mr. Phelps took Mr. Lowell's house in Lowndes Square; a\r\nrespectable dwelling in a very good square, but by no means an ideal\r\nlegation.  When Mr. Phelps became its tenant the atmosphere changed;\r\nthe climate was a softer climate.  The amelioration was due, in part,\r\nto Mrs. Phelps, who was beloved.  Mrs. Lowell had been an invalid.\r\nHer husband used to say: \"My wife has no acquaintance and I have no\r\ninvention\"--as an excuse for social shortcomings.  But Mrs. Phelps\r\nknew a great many people and charmed those whom she knew.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether an abler man than Mr. Phelps ever came from\r\nthe United States to London as Minister.  He was hailed at once as a\r\nbrother by his brethren of the Bar; and they put {208} him on a level\r\nwith their best.  His simplicity of character, his humour, his\r\ntruthfulness, were evident to everybody.  Intellectually he was\r\nanybody's equal.  As Minister he had, like all his predecessors, his\r\ntrade to learn.  But he soon learned what was essential; learned\r\ndiplomacy as if it were a new cause he had to master for a great\r\ntrial.  His mind was judicial.  He ought to have been Chief Justice\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States.\r\n\r\nWith the promise of a nomination to that great post in his pocket, he\r\nwent home; but he returned.  The will of Mr. Pat Collins, of\r\nBoston--hating Phelps because he would not, as Minister, be the\r\ninstrument of Irish ill-will to England--had proved stronger than the\r\nwill or the word of the President.  Mr. Cleveland's surrender, no\r\ndoubt under strong political pressure, deprived us of Mr. Phelps's\r\nservices as Chief Justice and he became a law lecturer at Yale.  He\r\nwas a jurist who would have adorned either place.  He was also an\r\norator who leaped into fame by a single speech, at the farewell\r\ndinner given him in London; although, indeed, his speech at a dinner\r\nof welcome on his arrival was scarcely less felicitous.  \"A\r\nmasterpiece of oratory dignified, eloquent, and pathetic,\" said Lord\r\nRosebery, a judge of oratory if there be one.\r\n\r\nWe have sent to England so many different kinds of Ministers and\r\nAmbassadors that they must be praised--and, happily, most of them can\r\nbe praised--with discrimination, and also with brevity, for I cannot\r\ngo on for ever writing on a {209} single topic.  I pass to Mr. Hay.\r\nThe mansion Mr. Hay leased in Carlton House Terrace was, like all\r\nthose on the south side of that short street looking on St. James's\r\nPark, adequate and even imposing.  It was like unto the larger one on\r\nthe corner, formerly Lord Ardilaun's, now Lord Ridley's.  When Mr.\r\nBlaine entered it one evening at a concert he said to the friend who\r\nwas with him: \"This is the first really palatial house to which you\r\nhave brought me.\"  Not a palace, but palatial.\r\n\r\nMr. Hay knew as well as any American then living, or better, what a\r\npart social influences could be made to play in diplomatic life.  He\r\nplayed that part with distinction.  He was born for it.  He had\r\ncultivated his natural gifts in half a dozen European capitals.  He\r\nhad such a knowledge of England and the English people that it has\r\nalways seemed a pity he did not write a book about them.  But he left\r\na record as Ambassador which tells the story.  He was a man who\r\ncarried his point without a collision.  He loved England and was\r\nbeloved.  When President McKinley sent for him to come home and be\r\nSecretary of State Hay said: \"I am a soldier and must obey orders.\r\nBut all my fun in life is over.\"\r\n\r\nAs it turned out it was not over.  A still greater career opened\r\nbefore him, and he was the first American Secretary of State to make\r\nan imaginative use of his opportunities, and a great name in Europe\r\nand Asia alike.  He was the first American Secretary of State to take\r\nthe lead in a {210} world-embracing policy; to unite the European\r\nPowers in support of it; to extract a binding pledge even from\r\nRussia; to bring Japan, not very willingly, into this charmed circle;\r\nand to lay the foundations of American influence in China broad and\r\ndeep.  We often talk of America as a world-power.  We have a right\r\nto, and whatever be the more recent, and perhaps in some cases rather\r\ndoubtful, extensions of our authority, we owe what is best and most\r\nlasting in our position abroad to Hay.\r\n\r\nNone of all this could Hay foresee when he quitted London for\r\nWashington.  What he knew was that he was relinquishing a place for\r\nwhich he had proved his fitness, and embarking upon the unknown.\r\nThis sorrow at leaving England was genuine, and the sorrow of his\r\nEnglish friends, and--if ever there be such a thing as a general\r\nsorrow--of the English public, was not less.\r\n\r\nThe late Queen said of Hay: \"He is the most interesting of all the\r\nAmbassadors I have known.\"  If the authority for this is wanted, it\r\nwas said by the Queen to Lord Pauncefote, then British Ambassador to\r\nthe United States; and Lord Pauncefote repeated it to me, with leave\r\nto repeat it to others, as I now do; by no means for the first time.\r\n\r\nTo Mr. Hay succeeded Mr. Choate.  I hope it will be taken as a\r\ncompliment if I say Mr. Choate was better liked the longer he stayed.\r\nHe had, when he arrived, a frankness of speech which is sometimes\r\ncalled American; and is, no doubt, characteristic of certain\r\nindividual Americans.  {211} There is in Mr. Henry James's\r\n_Bostonians_ an American banker settled in England to whom his son,\r\nprovoked by a remark of the father to a noble lord who was his guest,\r\nobserves:\r\n\r\n\"Well, father, you have lived here a long time, and you have learned\r\nsome of the things they say, but you haven't learnt the things they\r\ndon't say.\"\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable.  In new social circumstances, time is of the\r\nessence.  It is no reproach to Mr. Choate that he found it so.  He\r\nhad, and has, an exuberant wit; one somewhat contemptuous of\r\nconventions and established forms.  He poured it out in floods.  He\r\ngave free scope to its caprices.  When it had become chastened by\r\nexperience, the English delighted in it; as we Americans have long\r\ndelighted in it.  But time was needed on both sides.  The English and\r\nMr. Choate had to become accustomed to each other.  In the end they\r\ndid.  A beautiful harmony grew up, and before Mr. Choate went home he\r\nwas an accepted figure in the society which at first had sometimes a\r\nquestioning spirit.  He, too, lived as an Ambassador ought to live;\r\nand in Carlton House Terrace, like Mr. Hay.  From the beginning the\r\nForeign Office had found in him, in Bismarck's phrase, a man with\r\nwhom it was possible to do business.  For he had a kind of\r\npreternatural rapidity in mastering great affairs, and a marked skill\r\nin the composition of public addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{212}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTWO UNACCREDITED AMBASSADORS\r\n\r\nThey were both from Boston.  In the days when they first became known\r\nin England and began their work of conciliation as between England\r\nand the United States, Boston was still Boston, and New York had only\r\nbegun to be New York.  The latter statement may be challenged, but\r\nthe very men who take most pride in the New York of to-day ought to\r\nbe the first to accept it.  For Manhattan was not then the magnet, as\r\nLondon has always been, which drew to itself whatever was best from\r\nother parts of the land.  Boston was still the Athens of America.\r\nThere were excellent names elsewhere and at least one man of genius\r\nwho owed neither birth nor culture to Boston; but the capital of\r\nMassachusetts was none the less the literary capital of the United\r\nStates.  Emerson, Holmes, Lowell, Longfellow, Agassiz, R. H. Dana,\r\nJr., were all living and all in the fulness of their powers.\r\nTheodore Parker, the greatest force in the American pulpit, was just\r\ndead.  Chief Justice Shaw had been for thirty years the head of the\r\njudiciary of his own state and a revered authority throughout the\r\nUnion.  {213} Wendell Phillips had no rival as an orator.  Harvard\r\nwas the first of American colleges.  The ideas of New England, which\r\nwere the ideas of Boston, had spread and taken root, and new\r\ncommonwealths in the West were nourished on them; nay, these ideas\r\nand these conceptions of law and social order were the foundation\r\nstones on which new States were built.  No theologian had arisen to\r\ndim the fame--a great yet sombre fame--of Jonathan Edwards.  Daniel\r\nWebster, \"disappointed, defeated, slept by the solemn waves of the\r\nAtlantic,\" but you cannot think of Boston or of Massachusetts without\r\nhim; nor did the disasters of his last years much lessen the homage\r\npaid him at death or his immense influence on the political thought\r\nof the whole country.\r\n\r\nIf the intellectual pre-eminence of Boston in those days was somewhat\r\ngrudgingly admitted by New York, it was incontestable.  New York\r\npresently redressed the balance, not so much by her own creative\r\nefforts as by drawing much of what there was best in Boston to the\r\nbanks of the Hudson.  I believe Mr. Howells's migration at a later\r\nperiod was thought to be the decisive sign; one of many.  Commercial\r\ninfluences prevailed over the purer influences of literature.  The\r\npublisher took command.  But I apprehend that Mr. Howells did not\r\nforsake the Charles for the Hudson without many regrets.  The\r\natmosphere was not the same.  Old Abernethy used to say: \"If you live\r\nin the best air in the world, leave it and go to the second best.\"\r\nUnconsciously, {214} perhaps, Mr. Howells obeyed that medical\r\nprescription.  He went to the second best.\r\n\r\nDid he find a Tavern Club in New York?  Over the _noctes coenæque_ of\r\nthat pleasant company in Boston Mr. Howells used to preside, with a\r\ngenial charm all his own.  It was so long ago that I may be forgiven\r\nif I remember in print one of those evenings which owed so much to\r\nhis presiding genius.  He spoke and was the cause of speaking in\r\nothers.  He had the tact which drew from others more than they\r\nsupposed they had to give.  He gently compelled the most reluctant of\r\nguests from their chairs.  There was a brief eulogy on the victim.\r\nIt was Mr. Howells's art to paint a portrait so vivid, albeit\r\nflattering, it needed no name to be recognized.  \"If,\" said he, \"you\r\nwere in any doubt of his identity, you will recognize him by the look\r\nof determined unconsciousness on his face.\"\r\n\r\nI reckon it among the highest of Mr. Howells's many services that he\r\nhas been at times an interpreter between England and America, and in\r\nmore senses than one.  There is a sense in which every American\r\nwriter who reaches an English audience is an interpreter, or, better\r\nstill, an Ambassador, the business of an Ambassador being to keep the\r\npeace.  For when Lord Dufferin was complimented on his diplomatic\r\nfame he answered: \"Ah, that is all a mistake.  So long as we succeed\r\nyou never hear of us.  It is when we have failed that the world\r\nbegins to know of our existence.\"\r\n\r\nThat, however, is a _malàpropos_ anecdote, and {215} tells the other\r\nway; but in such papers as these there must be anecdotes.  Mr.\r\nHowells was not a silent Ambassador, and he would not have been an\r\nAmbassador had he been silent.  His books spoke for him.  The English\r\nthought, and still think, that his writings had some qualities which\r\nit does not suit the parent stock to consider distinctively American.\r\nThey liked the reserve, the simplicity, the continual though implicit\r\nreference to English literature.  It was partly because of the homage\r\nhe paid to the great masters that they presently came to accept him\r\nalso as a master.  They were quite aware that his homage was\r\nsometimes reluctant.  When it went further and, as in his unlucky\r\ncriticism of the greatest of English masters in fiction, became a\r\ncaricature, they resented it but they bore no malice.  How can you\r\nbear malice against a writer with so much sweetness of nature as Mr.\r\nHowells?\r\n\r\nBesides, what he has written about England is sympathetic; and is\r\nthought sympathetic by the English.  If it be also at times critical,\r\nthe English accept the criticism as it is meant.  Nothing is truer\r\nabout them than their indifference to criticism.  They regard Mr.\r\nHowells's essays as so many studies, and these studies as\r\ninterpretative.  What he has lately been writing of provincial towns\r\nis almost a revelation to the Londoner, who himself is sometimes\r\ncalled provincial, and does not mind.\r\n\r\nAnother Bostonian, Mr. Henry James, took a longer flight still; all\r\nthe way from Boston to {216} London and so to Paris and Italy, in all\r\nof which he is equally at home.  It was, I think, Colonel Higginson\r\nwho, in his patriotic impatience of the expatriated American, winged\r\na shaft at Mr. James, and at those who called him cosmopolitan.  \"In\r\norder to be truly cosmopolitan,\" said this eminent colonel, \"a man\r\nought to know something of his own country.\"  To which Mr. James has\r\nlately made the best possible reply by a book on his own country\r\nwhich is an appreciation like no other of recent days.  And I will\r\nsay this, that if Colonel Higginson supposes an American or a Russian\r\nor a Japanese can win favour with the English by trying to be English\r\nhe is profoundly mistaken.  The English like an American to be an\r\nAmerican.  If he is a writer, they like his writings to be American.\r\n\r\nWho are the American authors most popular in England?  I will take\r\nthe dead only.  They are Hawthorne, Emerson, Lowell, Longfellow,\r\nHolmes, Dana, and Walt Whitman; others, perhaps, but if there are\r\nothers they are all like these I have named, American to the\r\nfinger-tips, American in thought, in language, in method; nay, if you\r\nlike, in accent.  That is why they are relished in England.  I do not\r\ninclude Poe.  He is better understood in France than in England; his\r\ngenius is perhaps more Gallic than Saxon.  So much so that when the\r\nAmerican Ambassador delivered a discourse at the celebration in\r\nLondon of Poe's centennial, it was as if he had spoken on a topic\r\nremote from the minds of this English people.  They read {217} him\r\nbecause he was American Ambassador, or because he was Mr. Whitelaw\r\nReid, and for his graceful mastery of the topic and of the English\r\nlanguage.  But to them he seemed to be announcing a discovery.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Henry James adopted his new manner--the manner in which all\r\nhis books since _The Awkward Age_ have been produced--his English\r\nreaders turned away from him, or many of them did.  The change\r\ncoincided, or nearly so, with his change from pen and ink to\r\ndictation; a perilous experiment.  But, whatever else may be said of\r\nit, Mr. James has gradually won back his English public.  To them the\r\nmatter is more than the manner, as in Mr. Meredith's case also.  The\r\nAmerican is now thought a more distinguished writer than before.  I\r\nuse the word distinguished as he uses it, meaning that he has more\r\ndistinction as a writer and turns out more distinguished work.  They\r\nare no longer repelled by his colloquialisms, by his Gallicisms, by\r\nhis obscurities, by his involutions of structure, or by the\r\nlabyrinthine length of his sentences.  Through all these, they now\r\nperceive, pierces the true genius of the man.  Therefore is he\r\nanother Ambassador, another of those Americans who, from having\r\nbecome known abroad, have added lustre to the fame of their own\r\ncountry where, in European estimation, it most needs lustre, namely,\r\nin the domain of letters.\r\n\r\nBy the time the New Yorker of to-day has read thus far, if he has\r\nread, it may have become clear {218} to him how great a part of all\r\nthe renown in literature we have abroad comes to us from Boston.  All\r\nthe American writers best known here and most read, Whitman excepted,\r\nare of Boston, or of the State of which Boston is, or was, the final\r\nexpression.  If another exception were to be made it would be\r\nLincoln, whose greatest pieces of prose, and most of all the\r\nGettysburg address, are well known to Englishmen who know anything of\r\nAmerica.  If what Dr. Jonson said in the preface to his dictionary,\r\n\"The chief glory of every people arises from its authors,\" be true,\r\nthen what do we Americans not owe to Boston?  Supposing, that is, we\r\ncare for the judgment of a foreign nation, which Browning declared to\r\nbe like the judgment of posterity.\r\n\r\nFor some of these Bostonians London has a personal affection.\r\nEmerson is beloved.  Lowell was an immense favourite; a favourite\r\nnotwithstanding his combativeness in a society which prefers\r\ntoleration to excursions on the warpath.  Holmes during his visits\r\nhere was idolized, and as the Autocrat of the Breakfast Table he is\r\nidolized, and quoted day in and day out.  Of Longfellow's Poems in\r\nthe pre-copyright days more copies were sold than of Tennyson, and\r\nwhen he was here the English thought him almost one of themselves.\r\nDana's _Two Years Before the Mast_ is the one story of the sea which,\r\namong many rivals, seems likely to be immortal in England, and is,\r\nmeantime, the one which in circulation year after year far exceeds\r\nall others.  And Dana was one of those {219} Americans on whom the\r\nEnglish found an English birthmark.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when Mr. James and Mr. Howells used to be bracketed,\r\nas if they hunted in couples; which was not a discriminating view,\r\nthough a popular view.  It expressed itself in the jingle about\r\n\"Howells and James Young Men,\" of which the music-hall was the proper\r\nhome; and there it related to a firm in Regent Street, now extinct.\r\nBut it was sung by the daughters of a house where Mr. James was a\r\nguest, and almost in his hearing, to the horror of its mistress.  To\r\nall popularity there are penalties.  But the popularity of Mr. James\r\nis perennial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{220}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nSOME ACCOUNT OF A REVOLUTION IN INTERNATIONAL JOURNALISM\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nReturning to New York in the early autumn of 1866 and spending the\r\nwinter in _The Tribune_ office, I was again sent abroad the following\r\nyear, this time under an agreement to remain till 1870.  I was to go\r\nas the exponent of a new theory of American journalism in Europe, a\r\ntheory based on the belief that the cable had altered all the\r\nconditions of international news gathering and that a new system had\r\nto be created.  I had been long enough in London and on the Continent\r\nto be convinced that London must become the distributing centre of\r\nEuropean news for America.  I talked it over with Mr. Young on my\r\nreturn.  Mr. Young had a mind open to new ideas and he was unusually\r\nquick in deciding.  But this suggestion struck him at first as a\r\nproposal to impair the authority of the managing editorship.  He\r\nthought, naturally, there ought to be but one executive head, and\r\nthat a European manager, no matter how strictly subordinated to {221}\r\nhis chief in New York, would, at such a distance, acquire too much\r\nindependence.  The proposal, moreover, was far-reaching and had no\r\nprecedent; not that the want of a precedent troubled Mr. Young much.\r\nHe had spent much of his time as managing editor of _The Tribune_ in\r\ndisregarding precedents and laying down laws of his own.  But this\r\nscheme, he presently saw, would never have been thought of had not\r\nsubmarine telegraphy taken a practicable shape, nor would such a\r\nscheme have been of much practical use so long as news went by mail.\r\nNor could it be tried till a great many details had been thought out.\r\n\r\nUnder the old system, each _Tribune_ correspondent reported directly\r\nto New York.  Had that system remained unaltered, the triumphs of\r\nAmerican journalism in Europe would have been impossible.  That all\r\nthe European representatives of this paper should report to London\r\ninstead of New York might seem no very great matter, but in truth it\r\nwas vital.  When it had once been decided to establish a _Tribune_\r\noffice in London, a revolution had taken place.  There was to be a\r\nresponsible agent in charge.  He was to organize a new\r\nadministration.  He was to appoint and dismiss other agents all over\r\nthe Continent.  He was--subject, of course, to orders from New\r\nYork--to transmit news to New York.\r\n\r\nHe was to be the telephone between Europe and the managing editor in\r\nNew York.  But he was to relieve the New York office of its\r\nsupervision over the European staff.  What St. Petersburg {222} and\r\nVienna, Berlin and Paris, had to say to New York was to be said\r\nthrough London.  There would be an economy of time.  Orders could be\r\nsent from London and results received much more quickly than from New\r\nYork.  In an emergency as was presently to be shown, the difference\r\nwas enormous.  The notion of the centrality of London, of its unity\r\nas a news bureau, was perfectly simple.\r\n\r\nBut it took years for that one simple notion to get itself completely\r\naccepted and acted upon.  I will give one illustration.  When the\r\nfatal days of July, 1870, were upon us I thought I saw a great\r\nopportunity.  _The Tribune_ alone had an organization in Europe\r\ncompetent for the work of supplying war news.  But as I did not know\r\nhow much news New York wanted, I cabled a question to the editor then\r\ntemporarily in charge.  The answer came back that I was to go to\r\nBerlin.  It would have been a fatal step.  I should have come under\r\nGerman military rule, and cabling from Berlin at that time and much\r\nlater was a slow and uncertain business.  Nor could the plans I had\r\nin mind have been carried out from Berlin.  There would have been a\r\ncensorship upon every dispatch, and censorship means not merely\r\nmutilation to suit a bureaucratic ideal, but delay.  Berlin,\r\nmoreover, was remote, while London is on the road to New York, and\r\nspite of the cable the delay from that cause also would have been\r\ninjurious.  In short, I disobeyed the New York order.  I explained,\r\nof course, but I pointed out that an {223} unfettered discretion was\r\nessential to success, and I asked to be allowed a free hand or to be\r\nrelieved.  I was given the free hand.\r\n\r\nThese methods have since become so familiar that there is little need\r\nto explain them, but at that time they were not merely novel but were\r\nderided by journalists of great experience.  Mr. James Gordon Bennett\r\nwas one of those who scoffed at them, and presently was one of those\r\nwho followed them and made a large use of them, greatly to his own\r\nprofit and to that of the considerable news organization he\r\ncontrolled.  But at first he said nothing would induce him to set up\r\nin London a rival office to New York.  Now, every important journal\r\nin the United States has offices in London, and subsidiary offices in\r\nParis and often in other European capitals.  But the authority of New\r\nYork or Chicago remains what it was.\r\n\r\nThe idea once accepted, somebody had then to be appointed to London.\r\nMr. Young asked me to go.  I declined.  I liked leader-writing much\r\nbetter than news-collecting.  I thought the power of influencing\r\nopinion through the editorial columns of _The Tribune_ the most\r\nenviable of all powers.  The London scheme, moreover, was an\r\nexperiment and I did not think I had had enough experience with news\r\nto justify my undertaking so large a business.  But Mr. Young pressed\r\nit, saying it was my scheme and I ought to put it in operation.  He\r\nmight, had he chosen, have issued an order and I should have had no\r\nchoice but to obey or resign; {224} but that was not his way.  He\r\ntrusted to persuasion; he treated his subordinates as, for some\r\npurposes, his equals, and he did not care for unwilling service.  He\r\nwas a past master in the art of stating a case and in the use of\r\npersonal influence.  In the end he convinced me not only that I ought\r\nto go, but that I wanted to go, and I gave in, still with misgivings\r\nbut not without a certain enthusiasm at the prospect of doing a new\r\nthing in journalism.  It was like Young to say, as he did at parting:\r\n\"Remember, I don't care about methods.  You will use your own\r\nmethods.  What I want is results.\"\r\n\r\nThe incredulity with which _The Tribune_ experiment was first\r\nreceived gave way slowly, but it gave way.  I suppose it was the news\r\nservice of _The Tribune_ in the Franco-German War in 1870 which\r\nfinally convinced the most sceptical.  So I will pass to that,\r\nstopping only to explain one other matter.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1870 also that the first international newspaper alliance\r\nwas formed.  The papers which formed it were _The Tribune_ of New\r\nYork and _The Daily News_ of London.  I saw at the beginning that it\r\nwas desirable to be in a position to know what news would go to New\r\nYork through Reuter and The Associated Press.  That knowledge was\r\nonly to be had inside of a London newspaper office, and it was with\r\nthat view chiefly that I first made a proposal to _The Daily News_.\r\nI suppose I chose that paper because I knew its editor and manager.\r\nI did not think it likely {225} that _The Daily News_ service from\r\nthe battlefields would, at first, add much to our own; nor did it.\r\nBut I went to Mr.--afterward Sir John--Robinson with an offer to\r\nexchange news, whether by telegraph or mail, on equal terms; we to\r\ngive them everything we had and they to do the like by us.  The offer\r\nwas very coldly received.  Mr. Robinson could see no advantage to his\r\npaper from such an agreement.  I told him what we were doing and\r\nintending to do.  Still he was incredulous and he finally said No.  I\r\ntold him I did not mean that either paper should narrow its\r\noperations at the seat of war in expectation of help from the other,\r\nnor that either should credit the other with its news.  It was to be\r\na war partnership and each would put all its forces in the field.\r\nBut he would not have it.\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Frank Hill, then editor of _The Daily News_, who came to\r\nthe rescue.  The news department was none of his but he had an\r\nall-embracing intelligence, and when he heard what the offer was he\r\npressed it upon his colleague and finally secured its acceptance.\r\nThe credit for whatever benefit inured to _The Daily News_ from this\r\npartnership was therefore due originally to Mr. Frank Hill and not to\r\nMr. Robinson.\r\n\r\nIt remains true that Mr. Robinson was a very distinguished journalist\r\nand that his work at a later period of the war was of a high order.\r\nIf he had done nothing but secure the services of Mr. Archibald\r\nForbes he would have earned a lasting renown as manager.  But before\r\nForbes's {226} work had begun to tell, _The Daily News_, receiving\r\nand publishing _The Tribune_ dispatches as its own--as it had an\r\nabsolute right to do under our agreement--had won a great reputation\r\nfor its war news.  Sir John Robinson is dead but I published a\r\nstatement on this subject while he was living, which was brought to\r\nhis attention.  I said then, as I say now, that _The Daily News_ owed\r\nto _The Tribune_ almost the whole of the war news by which its\r\nreputation was at first acquired.  This period lasted down to the\r\nsurrender of Metz; perhaps later.  My statement was never disputed.\r\nIt may still be found in _Harper's Magazine_, where the facts are set\r\nforth much more fully than here, and it was this article in\r\n_Harper's_ which Sir John Robinson read.  We had ceased to be on good\r\nterms.  I forget why.  He grumbled a little at the publication of the\r\nstory, though without reason, but he attempted no denial and no\r\ndenial was possible.\r\n\r\nThe matter was much discussed at the time in the American Press and\r\nthere were many criticisms, based on an absolute ignorance of the\r\nreal arrangement between the two papers.  Further confusion grew out\r\nof the fact that one of _The Tribune's_ war correspondents had a\r\ncontract with _The Pall Mall Gazette_, then owned by Mr. George Smith\r\nand edited by Mr. Frederick Greenwood, one of the great journalists\r\nof his time.  This contract left him free to deal with us but not\r\nwith any London paper.  It followed, therefore, that some of _The\r\nTribune_ dispatches appeared in _The Daily {227} News_ and some in\r\n_The Pall Mall Gazette_.  Our New York friends could not understand\r\nthis tri-partite agreement; but then it was not necessary they\r\nshould; and their comments were much more amusing than they would\r\nhave been if they had known the truth.  The mind moves with great\r\nfreedom when unhampered by facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\n\"American methods,\" said certain English journalists, seeking to\r\naccount for _The Tribune's_ successes in the Franco-German War.  The\r\nphrase, whether meant as eulogy or criticism, was, at any rate,\r\nexplanatory, for we had had four years of Civil War experience, from\r\n1861 to 1865, while the English, unless we reckon the Indian Mutiny,\r\nhad to go back to the Crimean War in 1854 for precedents in war\r\ncorrespondence.  Moreover, the one great triumph of English\r\njournalism in the Crimea was not a triumph of method.  It was a\r\ntriumph due to the genius and courage of one man, Dr. Russell, who\r\nexposed through _The Times_ the murderous mistakes of army\r\norganization and army administration, and so forced the War Office\r\nand the Horse Guards to set their houses in order.  It was a great\r\npublic service; perhaps the greatest which any journalist in the\r\nfield ever performed.  But it was not exactly journalism.  It had\r\nlittle or nothing to do with that speed and accuracy in the\r\ncollection and transmission of news which, after all, must be the\r\n{228} chief business of a correspondent.  It has never been imitated.\r\nIt never will be till another Russell appears to rescue another\r\nBritish army in another Crimea.  That great exploit was not primarily\r\njournalistic but personal.\r\n\r\nI do not suppose it occurred to any of the many able newspaper\r\nmanagers in London that in dealing with a European war they would\r\nfind a rival in an American journal.  They knew there was an Atlantic\r\ncable but probably thought, if they thought about it at all, that the\r\ncable tolls would be prohibitive, for, as we shall see in a moment,\r\nthey had not yet grasped the idea that the telegraph is only a\r\nquicker post.  Putting the question of cost aside, it does not matter\r\nhow a piece of news or a dispatch or a letter is transmitted; whether\r\nby rail or by steamship or by wire.  What matters is that it should\r\nget there.  To-day this is a truism.  Forty years ago it was a\r\nparadox; in Europe if not in America.  There had been great\r\nachievements in the transmission of news long before the telegraph\r\nwas invented.  It may be doubted whether they were not, some of them,\r\ngreater than those due to the telegraph.  But so far as the use of\r\nthe telegraph is concerned we are dealing with the beginnings.  The\r\nyear 1870 is a year of transition if not of revolution.  I think we\r\nare entitled to remember with satisfaction that in telegraphic news\r\nenterprise, even in Europe, it was an American journal which led the\r\nway, and that _The Tribune_ was that journal.\r\n\r\nIn forming their war plans the managers of {229} English journals, as\r\nI was saying, left American journals out of account.  Perhaps they\r\nknew, in a dim kind of way, that _The Tribune_ had an office in\r\nLondon.  But the office had been there for three years and no other\r\nAmerican journal had yet followed _The Tribune's_ example.  Important\r\ndispatches had been sent from this London office to the New York\r\noffice by cable, but the London managers, if aware of the existence\r\nof the cable and of _The Tribune_ office in London, had not\r\nco-ordinated these two pieces of knowledge.  The area of all possible\r\ncompetition in war was news confined, in their view, to Fleet Street\r\nand Printing House Square.\r\n\r\nThey sat content, true Britons as they were, in their belief in their\r\nown supremacy; a supremacy often challenged, never overthrown.  _The\r\nTimes_ was still _The Times_.  _The Morning Post_ was still a\r\nthreepenny paper.  _The Daily Telegraph_ was still the organ of the\r\nsmall shopkeeper.  _The Daily News_ was the mouthpiece of\r\nNonconformist Liberalism, with no great pretensions to any other sort\r\nof authority.  The evening journalism was not supposed to be eager\r\nfor news, except news of that peculiar description which offers its\r\nreaders an afternoon sensation and is unaccountably omitted from the\r\nnext morning's papers.  The news journalism was yet to be born.  _The\r\nDaily Mail_ had never been heard of.  Lord Northcliffe, the man who\r\nhas done more than all others of his time toward the creation of a\r\nnew journalism in England, and who is almost more a statesman {230}\r\nthan a journalist, was then just two years old.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the outbreak of war was unexpected.  Lord Granville was\r\nthen Foreign Secretary and of an unshaken optimism.  Lord Hammond,\r\nPermanent Under Secretary of the Foreign Office, had announced a\r\nfortnight before that never since he had held a place in that office\r\nhad the sky been so free from clouds.  M. Émile Ollivier has lately\r\nretold with skill in the _Revue des Deux Mondes_ how the war was\r\nbrought on, but there is nothing in his elaborate special pleading to\r\nshow that any reasonable man ought to have expected the French\r\nEmperor, or even M. Ollivier himself, to follow the unreasonable,\r\nmad, arrogant policy they did follow.  Nor can Downing Street or\r\nFleet Street or Printing House Square be blamed for not being aware\r\nthat the conduct of affairs in France was in the control of men who\r\nwould play into Bismarck's hands.  For, let M. Ollivier say what he\r\nwill, Bismarck's opportunity would not have come had not France,\r\nafter Prussia had withdrawn Prince Leopold's candidature for the\r\nthrone of Spain, demanded a guarantee that it should never be renewed\r\nor never be supported by Prussia.  Never had events moved so quickly.\r\nPrince Leopold was first heard of July 4th, 1870.  On the 12th he\r\nrenounced his claim.  On the 13th Benedetti laid before the King of\r\nPrussia at Ems the demand of France for guarantees.  On the 14th Earl\r\nGranville woke from his deep dream of peace and strove to bring\r\nFrance and Prussia to terms.  On the {231} 15th the Emperor declared\r\nwar; the Chamber approving by an overwhelming majority.\r\n\r\nThere are in journalism two ways of dealing with a war crisis of this\r\nkind.  One way is to send into the field everybody you can lay hands\r\non to cover, _tant bien que mal_, as many points as possible, and so\r\ntake your chance of what may turn up.  The other is to choose the\r\nbest two men available and send one to the headquarters of each army.\r\nI preferred the latter, perhaps because there was a difficulty in\r\nfinding good men, and there were but two from whom I expected much\r\ngood.  These were Mr. Holt White, an Englishman, and M. Méjanel, a\r\nFrenchman.  Mr. White was ordered to join the Prussians and M.\r\nMéjanel to accompany his own countrymen.  The same instructions were\r\ngiven to both; very simple but I believe at that time quite novel in\r\nEngland.  Each was to find his way to the front, or wherever a battle\r\nwas most likely to be fought.  They were to telegraph to London as\r\nfully as possible all accounts of preliminary engagements.  If they\r\nhad the good luck to witness an important battle they were not to\r\ntelegraph, but, unless for some very peremptory reason, to start at\r\nonce for London, writing their accounts on the way or on arrival.  If\r\nthey could telegraph a summary first, so much the better; but there\r\nmust be no delay.  The essential thing was to arrive in London at the\r\nearliest moment.  They were to provide beforehand for a substitute,\r\nor more than one, who would take up their work during their absence.\r\n\r\n{232}\r\n\r\nThese instructions were based on the improbability that any single\r\ncorrespondent could anticipate any very important news which\r\nGovernments, the news agencies, and the Rothschilds would all three\r\nendeavour to send first.  I reverse the order in which a Minister\r\nonce said to me news of war or of high politics usually arrived.\r\nSuch news, he said, comes to the Rothschilds first, next to the\r\nPress, and to the Government last of all.  Besides, the mere fact\r\nnever contents the public.  It wants the full story.  There was never\r\nmuch chance of sending the full story by wire from the battlefield or\r\nfrom any town hard by; nor, indeed, from any capital; even from a\r\nneutral capital.  Only when once in London was a correspondent master\r\nof the situation.\r\n\r\nMr. Holt White carried out his instructions with an energy, a\r\ncourage, an intelligence to which no tribute can be too high.  In the\r\nfirst instance he witnessed the battle--not an important one except\r\nthat it was the first--of Spicheren, and wired a column or so to\r\nLondon.  It was I believe, the first battle story of any length ever\r\nsent by wire from the Continent to London.  English journalism, as I\r\nsaid above, had not yet regarded the telegraph as anything but a\r\nmeans of transmitting results.  The full account was to come by mail.\r\nI had told Mr. Robinson I meant to use the telegraph in this new way,\r\nbut he was not ready to believe it could be done.  So when I carried\r\nMr. White's account to _The Daily News_ office, after cabling a\r\nrewritten copy to New York, {233} I took with me the original\r\ntelegraph forms as well as the second copy.  The dispatch as\r\ntelegraphed by Mr. White was slightly condensed, had been carelessly\r\nhandled, and was not in good shape for the printers.  I handed my\r\ncopy to Mr. Robinson.  He looked at it with undisguised suspicion.\r\n\r\n\"It is your handwriting,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI admitted that.\r\n\r\n\"And the battle was fought only yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It could not have come by post.\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, how then?\"\r\n\r\n\"By wire.\"\r\n\r\n\"A dispatch of that length!  It is unheard of.\"\r\n\r\nBut I thought this had gone far enough and showed him the telegraph\r\nforms.  Still he said:\r\n\r\n\"Do you expect me to print this to-morrow in _The Daily News_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Print it or not as you choose.  It will certainly appear in _The\r\nTribune_.  I have done as I agreed in bringing you the dispatch.\r\nYou, of course, will do as you think best about publishing it.\"\r\n\r\nI repeat this because it indicates better than I could otherwise the\r\njournalistic state of mind at that time in respect of Continental\r\ntelegrams.  Mr. Robinson was at the head of his profession, yet this\r\nwas his reception of this piece of news.  In the end Mr. Frank Hill,\r\nthe editor, was called into consultation.  He had no hesitation and,\r\nas before, finally brought his colleague to reason.  {234} The\r\ntelegram duly appeared next morning in _The Daily News_, heralded by\r\na leading article in which the telegram was rewritten, its importance\r\npointed out, the celerity of its dispatch and arrival dwelt on, and\r\nso the readers of _The Daily News_ had every opportunity to admire\r\nthe enterprise of that journal.\r\n\r\nThis was very far from being Mr. Holt White's most brilliant exploit,\r\nbut it was his first.  He had not the luck to see the battle of\r\nWorth, the earliest of the grave disasters of the French.  No\r\njournalist had.  That great engagement and the defeat of Marshal\r\nMacMahon were foreseen by nobody, the Germans themselves excepted,\r\nand there exists no account of the battle in the newspapers of the\r\nday, save such as came by hearsay; or, much later, the official\r\nreports.  But when the bare facts were known they were thought\r\nprophetic, and the military critics of Pall Mall and Whitehall said\r\ngravely: \"This is the beginning of the end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{235}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n  HOLT WHITE'S STORY OF SEDAN AND HOW IT\r\n  REACHED THE NEW YORK TRIBUNE\r\n\r\nI pass over the interval between Worth and Sedan, crowded as it was\r\nwith events, stopping only to remark that _The Tribune_ was indebted\r\nto an American writer on _The Daily News_ for its account of\r\nGravelotte, but not to _The Daily News_ except for the opportunity of\r\nbuying that account, at a high price.  There was an entangling\r\nalliance which forbade _The Daily News_ to hand it over to _The\r\nTribune_, but did not prevent the correspondent of that paper from\r\nselling it.  I am not sure whether the name of the writer is known\r\nbut in the circumstances it is not for me to disclose it.  The\r\nnarrative was, of course, cabled to _The Tribune_ at once.\r\nGravelotte was fought on the 18th of August.  The account of the\r\nbattle reached New York, I think, on the 21st.  It was, at any rate,\r\nthe first, and for some time the only narrative published.  The\r\ndefeated French called it the battle of Rézonville, and under that\r\nname was this description first printed.  From a military point of\r\nview the account had no great value, but it was picturesquely written\r\nand in those {236} difficult days anything from the field was eagerly\r\nread.\r\n\r\nGreater days were at hand.  The battle of Sedan was fought on\r\nThursday, September 1st, 1870, followed by the surrender of the town,\r\nthe army, and the Emperor Napoleon on the day following.  The news of\r\nthe catastrophe was not known in London till Saturday morning at ten\r\no'clock, and then only in the briefest form; the mere fact and not\r\nmuch more; through the general Press agency; I suppose Reuter's.  Mr.\r\nRobinson wired me and I went to _The Daily News_ office.  But the\r\nbare news was of no great use for my purposes.  I went back to _The\r\nTribune_ office in Pall Mall wondering what I was to do, and still\r\nmore what _The Tribune_ correspondent in the field were doing.  I had\r\nnot long to wait.  A dispatch arrived from Mr. Holt White saying he\r\nshould be in London that afternoon, and at five o'clock he walked\r\ninto the office.\r\n\r\nSeldom have I been so glad to see any man's face as I was to see his,\r\nbut there was hardly so much as a greeting between us.  I asked first:\r\n\r\n\"Is your dispatch ready?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a word of it written.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you sit down at once and begin?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot.  I am dead tired, and have had no food since daybreak.  I\r\nmust eat and sleep before I can write.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked it; a mere wreck of a correspondent, haggard, ragged,\r\ndirty, incapable of the effort which nevertheless had to be made.  It\r\nwas no {237} time to consider anybody's feelings.  A continent was\r\nwaiting for the news locked up in that one man's brain, and somehow\r\nor other the lock must be forced, the news told, and the waiting\r\ncontinent supplied with what it wanted.  Incidentally, it was such an\r\nopportunity for _The Tribune_ as seldom had come to any newspaper.\r\nIt was necessary to use a little authority.  I said to Mr. Holt White:\r\n\r\n\"You shall have something to eat, but sleep you cannot till you have\r\ndone your dispatch.  That must be in New York to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nSo we went over to the Pall Mall Restaurant, which was then in the\r\nbuilding now replaced by the Oceanic House, the headquarters of the\r\nInternational Marine Navigation Company; if that be its name.  Food\r\nand drink refreshed him.  We were back in _The Tribune_ office not\r\nlong after six and work began.\r\n\r\nMr. Holt White wrote one of the worst hands ever seen, so I said to\r\nhim I would copy as he wrote and my copy would go to the cable\r\noperators.  Bad or good, mine was a hand they were familiar with.  We\r\nsat opposite each other at the same table, and I copied sheet by\r\nsheet till there was enough to give the cable a start, then took it\r\nto the Anglo-American cable office in Telegraph Street.  I went\r\nmyself for two reasons: first to make sure it was delivered, and\r\nsecond to make sure it went without interruption.  The latter,\r\nindeed, was a point of which it was impossible, under the Weaver\r\nrégime, to make sure.  But I {238} could at least hand in the message\r\nover the counter.  Many a message have I trusted myself and nobody\r\nelse with, and many a letter have I posted with my own hands;\r\neverything, in fact, of importance ever since I had anything to do\r\nwith journalism.  It is often inconvenient but I have found it a good\r\nrule.\r\n\r\nI dwell on these details.  Few things in American journalism, the\r\nCivil War excepted, have made more stir than this exploit of Mr. Holt\r\nWhite.  But the full credit which belongs to him he has never had.\r\nConsider what he had done.  He had been all through the battle; he\r\nhad been in the saddle all day from four o'clock in the morning till\r\nnightfall.  The battle over, he started for London.  He rode with his\r\nlife in his hand.  He had to pass the lines of three armies, the\r\nPrussians who refused him a permit, the French outposts to the north\r\nof Sedan, and the Belgians, who made a pretence of guarding their\r\nfrontier and the neutrality of Belgian territory.  He could not\r\nexplain how he managed it.  When he reached Brussels he thought it\r\nmight be possible to write there and to wire his account from\r\nBrussels to London.  But at the chief telegraph office in Brussels\r\nthe official in charge told him flatly he would accept no dispatch\r\nrelating to the war.  The issue of the battle was unknown in\r\nBrussels.  Anything handed in for transmission to London or elsewhere\r\nwould be submitted first of all to the censor; and in Brussels, as\r\nelsewhere, the censorship is a heart-rending business; delay\r\ninevitable; and there was {239} no time for delay.  It was, as I\r\nexplained in an earlier chapter, one reason why all correspondents\r\nwere directed to come straight to London where the censorship did not\r\nexist.  Mr. Holt White was soon satisfied that it was useless to try\r\nto telegraph from Brussels, and he came on by train to Calais, missed\r\nthe Calais boat, caught a later one, which did not connect with the\r\nDover-London service, and, once at Dover, chartered a special train\r\nto London and so at last arrived.\r\n\r\nI asked him if any other correspondent had come with him.  He thought\r\nnot; at any rate, no one whom he knew as correspondent and, of\r\ncourse, no one came by the special train.  Still, there was no\r\ncertainty.  It was already two days since the sun had gone down on\r\nthe beaten French in sedan.  There was nothing to do except to hurry\r\non the dispatch to New York.\r\n\r\nWith indomitable courage White wrote on.  After a time I asked him if\r\nhe would rest a little before finishing.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, \"if I stop I shall go to sleep, and if I go to sleep I\r\nshall not wake.\"\r\n\r\nThe man's pluck was a splendid thing to see.  His answer was like the\r\nanswer of an Atlantic captain who, in the old days when there was no\r\ntelephone and designers had not learned how to make the captain's\r\ncabin the nerve centre of the ship, had been for three days and\r\nnights on the bridge.  I asked him how he lived through it.  He said\r\nit was rather trying to the knees.\r\n\r\n\"But did you never sit down?\"\r\n\r\n{240}\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I had sat down I should have gone to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nThere are heroisms of that kind in the routine of life, professional\r\nand other, and even in the profession of journalism of which the\r\nnewspaper reader in the morning over his coffee and rolls never\r\nthinks.  But they are real and without them, and without the loyalty\r\nand devotion of such men, there might sometimes be nothing for the\r\nman with his coffee and rolls to read.\r\n\r\nWhite sat at his table till midnight and later.  It was nearer two\r\no'clock than one before the last of his message was filed in\r\nTelegraph Street.  Whether by Mr. Weaver's intervention or not I\r\ncannot say, but there was a delay on the wires.  The delay, I was\r\nafterwards told, was on the Newfoundland land lines to New York.  It\r\nmay be so.  It was a message six columns long and not all of it\r\nappeared in _The Tribune_ that next Sunday morning though all of it\r\nhad been filed in ample time; two o'clock in the morning in London\r\nbeing only nine o'clock of the evening before in New York.\r\n\r\nNo matter.  It was a clear, coherent, vivid battle story, and it was\r\nthe only one.  No morning paper in London had any account of the\r\nbattle till the Tuesday following; and all New York accounts, _The\r\nTribune_ excepted, were from the London Press or Press agencies.  It\r\nis not worth while to recall the comments of _The Tribune's_ rivals.\r\nThey were angry, naturally enough, and they resorted to conjectures\r\nwhich might as well {241} have been left unexpressed.  It is enough\r\nto explain further that Mr. Holt White's narrative did not appear in\r\n_The Daily News_ because he had an agreement with _The Pall Mall\r\nGazette_.  Part of this account, therefore, was printed in an\r\nabridged form in _The Pall Mall_ of Monday, for which it was written\r\nseparately.  _The Pall Mall_ is an evening paper, and when that was\r\ncabled to New York and found to be obviously from the same source as\r\n_The Tribune's_ the guesses grew wild.  But the plain truth is now\r\ntold, and is simple enough.\r\n\r\nMr. Holt White was a journalist but not at that time a journalist of\r\nany exceptional reputation or position.  This, I think, was the first\r\nvery considerable thing he had done.  I am sorry to have to add that\r\nit was also the last.  He was a man to whom, after such an\r\nachievement as this, a long repose became necessary.  He rejoined the\r\nPrussian headquarters, spent the winter at Versailles, and during all\r\nthose months did practically nothing.  Of his great gifts and\r\ncapacities he made no further use, even down to the end of his life,\r\nand the end came early.  But he is entitled to be remembered as a man\r\nwho at one supreme moment accomplished one of the most brilliant\r\nexploits in the history of journalism.  Let us judge him by his best,\r\nand, so judged, his name must take its place with those of Russell,\r\nMcGahan, Forbes, Steevens, and others of that rank if there are any\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nOne more remark, to remind you how alien from {242} the mind of the\r\nBritish journalist at that time was the free use of the telegraph,\r\nwhich in America had become a thing of every day.  When White sat\r\ndown to write he said to me: \"I suppose I am to condense as much as\r\npossible?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, write fully.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is going by cable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be some columns long.\"\r\n\r\n\"The longer the better.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought a little, then said:\r\n\r\n\"I still don't quite understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then please put the cable out of your mind, and write exactly as if\r\nyou were writing for a London paper and the printer's devil waiting.\"\r\nAnd he did.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{243}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nGREAT EXAMPLES OF WAR CORRESPONDENCE\r\n\r\nBut Sedan from the Prussian point of view was one thing; from the\r\nFrench it might be, and must be, quite another.  M. Méjanel, had\r\nthings gone otherwise, might have been expected to give us the French\r\nversion, but since he was with the French headquarters in Sedan he\r\nwas presumably a prisoner of war, and nothing was to be hoped for\r\nfrom him.  Mr. Holt White, fresh from the field, thought there was\r\nlittle or no chance.  No one except Mr. White had got through from\r\neither army.  The English papers of Monday morning were a blank\r\nexcept for a few rather ragged telegrams.  Mr. Robinson at _The Daily\r\nNews_, had nothing.  There was a lull.  I am speaking of war news\r\nproper, for there was, of course, the one great event of Saturday in\r\nParis, and there was no certainty whence the next flash of light, or\r\nlightning, would come.  Sedan had been fought on Thursday, and it was\r\nnow Monday afternoon.\r\n\r\nWhile I sat in _The Tribune_ office in Pall Mall brooding on these\r\ndifficulties and almost despairing of further good fortune the door\r\nopened, and in walked Méjanel.  He had not telegraphed.  {244} He had\r\na Gallic indifference to time and to the technique of journalism.  He\r\nhad just come as soon as he could.  An angel from heaven would have\r\nbeen less welcome.\r\n\r\n\"Were you in Sedan during the battle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and outside with the army.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you taken prisoner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were released?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I forget whether I was released or whether I escaped.\"\r\n\r\nTo escape meant that he had taken his chance of being shot by a\r\nPrussian sentry, and also of being rearrested and tried by court\r\nmartial should he fall again into Prussian hands.  Released,\r\ntherefore, seemed the better word of the two.\r\n\r\n\"Have you written your account?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  I had no means of writing while a prisoner, and I have since\r\nbeen doing my best to get to London.\"\r\n\r\nAs in White's case, there was time enough.  Méjanel had an English\r\nside to him--his mother was English--and that half of him was\r\nimperturbable.  Neither the danger he had passed nor the task that\r\nlay before him, all inexperienced as he was, shook his nerves.  He\r\nwas quite ready to sit down and write at once.  As in White's case, I\r\ncopied sheet by sheet.  Méjanel's English was here and there at fault\r\nbut was, on the whole, good.  What was more important, his memory was\r\nprecise; he knew how to tell his story clearly, and he gave us a\r\npicture of the battle-horrors {245} from within the beleaguered town\r\nor from within the French defence, which he made the reader see as he\r\nhimself had seen them.  He wrote on till he had filled four columns,\r\nmodestly wondering as he wrote whether he was not too diffuse;\r\nwondering that it should be thought worth cabling; wondering whether\r\nhis English was good enough; and wondering whether the military part\r\nof it was not all nonsense.  Reassured on all these points, he wrote\r\nfluently and joyfully, at midnight laying down his pen with the\r\nremark: \"_Enfin, j'ai vidé mon sac_.\"\r\n\r\nM. Méjanel's dispatch appeared in _The Tribune_ complete on Tuesday\r\nmorning.  Neither Mr. Weaver nor the Newfoundland lines were out of\r\norder this time.  _The Tribune_, had, therefore, within less than\r\nthree days of the first coming of the news of the battle of Sedan,\r\ngiven to the American public complete accounts--ten columns\r\naltogether--of the battle from the Prussian side and from the French\r\nside; a unique performance.\r\n\r\nNor was this all.  The revolution in Paris and the declaration of the\r\nRepublic, September 4th, were dealt with not less fully, and of\r\ncourse by cable.  During four days the number of words cabled was a\r\nlittle over sixteen thousand, at a cost of as many dollars.  If we\r\nnever rose again to quite those heights it was because never again\r\nwas there such a quick sequence of great events.  But for a long time\r\nthe daily average was high, and not long after this _The Daily News_\r\nservice {246} became efficient, and, as I have said before, _The\r\nTribune_ in the end profited by it.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, the full advantage of that accrued came the\r\nsurrender of Metz, October 27th, and the remarkable narrative,\r\nincluding a visit to Metz, published simultaneously by _The Daily\r\nNews_ and _The Tribune_.  It was supposed in London that Mr.\r\nArchibald Forbes was the author of this narrative, and it was\r\nreckoned among his best performances.  _The Daily News_ never thought\r\nit worth while to state the truth; nor was it bound to make any\r\nstatement.  The real author was Mr. Gustav Müller, a correspondent in\r\nthe employment of _The Tribune_.  As in the other cases I have\r\ndescribed, Mr. Gustav Müller came to London and wrote his account in\r\n_The Tribune_ office.  It was cabled forthwith to New York, and a\r\ncopy handed to _The Daily News_.  It was the first to be published in\r\nLondon, and the first to be published in New York.  So far as London\r\nis concerned, it is enough to say that _The Times_ on the following\r\nmorning copied it from _The Daily News_, crediting it to _The Daily\r\nNews_, with a deserved compliment, and saying:\r\n\r\n\"We congratulate our contemporary on the energy and enterprise of its\r\ncorrespondent.\"\r\n\r\nStill, Mr. Robinson did not think it needful to explain that it was\r\nin fact a _Tribune_ dispatch, and that it was a _Tribune_\r\ncorrespondent who had wrung from _The Times_ this testimony.\r\n\r\nThe tale has a tragic end.  For a long time I thought it a tragedy of\r\ndeath.  I sent Mr. Gustav {247} Müller back to the field at once,\r\nwith a large sum of money.  I never heard from him again.  Inquiries\r\nin every possible quarter brought no tidings of him.  It seemed plain\r\nthat he had fallen in battle or had been murdered and robbed by some\r\nof the bands that hang on the outskirts of every army.  Some years\r\nafter I told the whole story in _Harper's Magazine_, leaving the\r\nmystery unexplained otherwise than by conjecture.  When, lo! it\r\nappeared that Mr. Gustav Müller had not fallen by a French bullet or\r\na brigand's knife, but was alive in New York and ready to submit to\r\nan interview.  If he were truly reported, he seemed to think his\r\nconduct in no need of defence.  He had changed his mind, and instead\r\nof returning to the field had gone home.  Why he never wrote to me or\r\ncommunicated in any way with _The Tribune_ he omitted to say.\r\n\r\nAs I have stripped one leaf from Mr. Forbes's laurels, I will add\r\nthat two of the most brilliant news exploits in all the history of\r\nwar journalism are to be credited to him.  One was his night ride of\r\n110 miles alone through a hostile country, after the British victory\r\nof Ulundi, July 4th, 1879.  Lord Chelmsford, commanding the British\r\nforces, had refused Forbes leave to start and given orders for his\r\narrest.  He risked the British bullets and the Zulu assegais, and got\r\nthrough.  The other was at the Shipka Pass, in August, 1877.  It was\r\nthe crisis of the Russo-Turkish War.  General Gourko was holding the\r\nPass.  Suleiman Pacha day after day was flinging his whole force\r\nagainst {248} the Russian entrenchments.  The world was waiting.  No\r\nnews came.  The Russians and Turks were not people who concerned\r\nthemselves much about public opinion.  Forbes was at Bucharest.\r\nTired of expecting messages from the scene, he rode to the Pass, made\r\nhis way through the Turks and into the Russian lines, stayed in the\r\ntrenches till he had satisfied himself--and he was a competent\r\njudge--that Suleiman's effort was spent and that Gourko could hold\r\nhis own, and then made his way out again, hoping to reach Bucharest\r\nin time for a dispatch that night to_ The Daily News_.  At or near\r\nTirnova he was stopped by the Russians and taken before the Czar.\r\n\r\nThe Czar, like the rest of the world, was without news.  He had sent\r\none aide-de-camp after another to the Pass; not one had returned.\r\nForbes used to say that the Czar treated him very well.  He asked if\r\nit was true that Forbes had been with General Gourko, and, when told\r\nit was, desired that the exact situation should be explained to him.\r\nForbes set it forth with that military clearness and precision which\r\nmade his work in the field invaluable.  The Czar asked him if he\r\ncould draw a plan.  He drew it.  All sorts of questions were put to\r\nhim.  He answered all.  He was asked for his opinion.\r\n\r\n\"I told His Imperial Majesty that I had been a soldier, that I had\r\nhad much experience of battles as a correspondent, and that I had no\r\ndoubt General Gourko would hold the Pass.\"\r\n\r\nThe interview lasted an hour or more.\r\n\r\n{249}\r\n\r\n\"At the end I besought His Majesty's permission to continue my\r\njourney, saying I thought nothing was known in Europe, and that it\r\nwas for the interest of Russia that the facts which I had had the\r\nhonour to lay before His Imperial Majesty should be made public.  The\r\nCzar thanked me for the information I had given, declared himself\r\nconvinced it was true and my judgment well founded, and dismissed me.\"\r\n\r\nSo Forbes rode on, arriving at Bucharest, the first point from which\r\nit was possible to telegraph, at eight o'clock in the evening.  It\r\nwas Forbes himself who told me the story:\r\n\r\n\"I had been in the saddle or in the trenches and under fire for three\r\ndays and nights, without sleep and with little food.  When I walked\r\ninto the hotel at Bucharest I was a beaten man.  I felt as if I could\r\nnot keep awake or sit in my chair, much less write.  Yet it was an\r\nopportunity which does not come twice in a man's life.  I had, and\r\nnobody else had, the news for which all Europe was hungering; the\r\nmost momentous news since Sedan; but not one word written, and not an\r\nounce of strength left.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what did you do?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was curious indeed.\r\n\r\n\"I called the waiter and told him to bring me a pint of champagne,\r\nunopened.  I uncorked it, put the neck of the bottle into my mouth\r\nbefore the gas had time to escape, and drank the whole of the wine.\r\nThen I sat up and wrote the four {250} columns which appeared next\r\nmorning in _The Daily News_.\"\r\n\r\nI remember that narrative well.  There was not in it from beginning\r\nto end a trace of fatigue or confusion.  It was a bulletin of war,\r\nwritten with masterly ease, with the most admirable freshness and\r\nforce.  Nothing better of the kind was ever done.  It rang from one\r\nend of Europe to the other, and across the Atlantic.  The Hour and\r\nthe Man in this case had come together, and if Forbes had done\r\nnothing else this would entitle him to the immortality which is his.\r\n\r\nAll the same, the pint of champagne was a hazardous experiment.\r\nForbes knew it but, as he said, it was that or nothing.  The next man\r\nwho tries it ought to be very sure that he has both the intellectual\r\nelasticity Forbes had, and his physique.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{251}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nA PARENTHESIS\r\n\r\nTo what I have said of journalism I need not add much.  I remained in\r\nLondon as the representative of _The New York Tribune_, and in charge\r\nof its European affairs from 1867 to 1895; returning then to New York\r\nand Washington for _The Times_, till 1905.\r\n\r\nWhen _The Tribune_ began publishing a Sunday edition, one other\r\ninnovation upon the established practice followed.  I sent each week,\r\nby cable, a column containing a summary view of what seemed most\r\nimportant during the week.  It was not a summary of news and it was\r\nnot a leading article but a compromise between the two.  It was, at\r\nany rate, the first of its kind, and I was allowed to put it in such\r\nshape as I thought best, since then, the American demand for what are\r\ncalled \"Sunday cables\" has grown, the despatches to all the great\r\njournals of the United States have increased in number, in length, in\r\nvariety, and in daring.  All I claim for mine is that it was the\r\nfirst.  I do not know whether any work in journalism has in it the\r\nelements of permanency.  Probably not.  Journalism is an expression\r\nof the {252} governing forces of the day, and day by day changes as\r\nthe forces change and the days change.  But should a history of\r\ninternational journalism be written, the historian will perhaps\r\nremember that as agent of _The Tribune_ I set up in London that\r\nEuropean news-bureau which all other great American journals after\r\nsome years copied; that I was in charge of it during the\r\nFranco-German War; and that the success of _The Tribune_ during that\r\nwar was due to the system already described, which I had established\r\nthree years before.\r\n\r\nThe years that follow are full of miscellaneous interests.  The\r\nMemories, some of which are reprinted in this volume, are not\r\nprimarily historical, though I hope they are accurate.  They are\r\nimpressions.  They cannot be presented as a sequence, and as each\r\nchapter, or group of chapters, deals with a separate subject, I\r\nrepublish most of them in the order in which they were written and\r\nprinted, or otherwise as may seem convenient.  I pass now to an\r\nincident of the Irish \"War,\" and then to a diplomatic experiment in\r\nthe history of those long contentious relations between Canada and\r\nthe United States which have so often imperilled the friendship\r\nbetween England and the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{253}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n  \"CIVIL WAR?\"--INCIDENTS IN THE 'EIGHTIES--SIR\r\n  GEORGE TREVELYAN--LORD BARRYMORE\r\n\r\nThe streets of London were red one day in November, 1909, with\r\nplacards proclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"The Lords declare Civil War!\"\r\n\r\nI suppose the Radicals thought it paid to force the note.  Mr.\r\nWinston Churchill was their bandmaster for the moment.  There is no\r\nmore effective political rhetorician, provided you accept that\r\nfallacy about the folly of the people against which the warning of\r\nMr. Lincoln passes unheeded.\r\n\r\nBut there was, at least on one side, a state of feeling in the\r\ncountry comparable to nothing I can remember except the feeling which\r\nprevailed during the Home Rule crisis, and far stronger now than\r\nthen.  In that crisis also the Lords came to the rescue of the\r\nKingdom, which they saved from disintegration and ruin.  Ruin for the\r\nmoment it would have been; only to be finally averted by the\r\nreconquest of Ireland.  Even to the spectator those were stirring\r\ndays.  England and Ireland from 1881 onward had become the Wild West.\r\nThe revolver was the real safeguard of personal {254} liberty.  I\r\ndon't think it will be quite like that now, but it does seem as if\r\nthe bitterness of contention and the personalities of politics would\r\ngo further now than then; perhaps have already gone further.\r\n\r\nI was in Ireland for a fortnight during one of the worst periods, but\r\nthere were times when London was as disturbed and distressful as\r\nIreland itself.  Those were years of dynamite in England, when, as\r\nLord Randolph Churchill said, the railway stations were flying about\r\nour ears, and when London Bridge came near being blown up, and when\r\nEnglishmen in high place were targets.  From the Prime Minister down\r\nto his youngest colleague, no man was safe without a guard of\r\ndetectives; and not then.  Mr. Gladstone, whose courage was high,\r\nshook off his escort whenever he could.  Other Ministers paid more\r\nrespect to a very real danger.  Sir George Trevelyan, who was\r\nappointed Chief Secretary for Ireland in 1882, submitted sensibly to\r\nthe precautions the Home Office and Scotland Yard thought needful.\r\nOne afternoon I met Trevelyan in a Bond Street shop.  We left the\r\nshop together.  Two quite innocent-looking men were outside the door.\r\n\"I hope you don't mind,\" said Trevelyan.  \"I am obliged to let them\r\nfollow me.\"  They were Scotland Yard detectives.  As we walked down\r\nthe street they were within earshot all the way, their vigilance\r\nunrelaxing.  Whether they thought their ward in greater or less\r\ndanger because I was with him I cannot say.  We parted at the corner\r\nof Piccadilly.  {255} In both streets the throng on the sidewalk was\r\ndense, but through it these men made their way without violence,\r\nwithout haste, but never for an instant allowing themselves to be\r\nseparated from the Chief Secretary by so much as an arm's length.  He\r\nwalked in peril not only real but imminent.  Two days before his\r\nappointment as Chief Secretary his predecessor, Lord Frederick\r\nCavendish, and Mr. Burke, permanent Under Secretary, had been\r\nmurdered.  To accept that inheritance of probable assassination was a\r\ngallant act, quite characteristic of Sir George Trevelyan.  But I do\r\nnot imagine that he or his friends ever while he held that office\r\nforgot what had happened in Phoenix Park.\r\n\r\nNot many evenings later I met Sir George Trevelyan at dinner.  If he\r\nhad not been famous as a writer and Member of Parliament and Irish\r\nSecretary and much else, he might well have been famous as a\r\ndiner-out.  He had the art of conversation.  His uncle's influence\r\nhad left him, in this respect, untouched.  Where Macaulay discoursed\r\nand reeled off dreary pages of encyclopædic knowledge, Trevelyan\r\ntalked lightly and well; claiming no monopoly, preaching no sermon,\r\nwearying no company too well bred to show itself bored.  He had a\r\nfelicity of allusion which was so wholly free from pedantry as to\r\nseem almost accidental.  His voice, like Browning's, was strident and\r\nhis laugh sometimes boisterous; but this was in moments of excitement.\r\n\r\nOn this particular evening there was something {256} besides his\r\ninspiriting talk which drew the attention of the company.  So long as\r\nthe ladies were at table he talked with his wonted energy.  When the\r\ndining-room door had closed on the last of these departing angels\r\nTrevelyan sank into his chair with a sigh, drew a revolver from the\r\nbreast pocket of his coat, laid it on the table and said to his host:\r\n\r\n\"Pray forgive me, but if you knew how tired I am of carrying this\r\nthing about!\"\r\n\r\nOn Sir George Trevelyan as on others the Irish Secretaryship left its\r\nmark.  A year of office aged him as if it were ten.  He came out worn\r\nand grey: not yet forty-five years old.  The tragedy was in one\r\nparticular a tragi-comedy.  Half his moustache had turned white; the\r\nother half black as before.  And I suppose it shook his nerve more or\r\nless and was perhaps responsible for that fickleness of purpose or of\r\nview which led him first to oppose and then to adopt Mr. Gladstone's\r\npolicy of Home Rule.\r\n\r\nI saw one side of the Irish question during a visit to Lord\r\nBarrymore, then Mr. Smith-Barry, and his beautiful American wife, at\r\nFota Island, near Queenstown.  Mr. William O'Brien had launched\r\nshortly before this his New Tipperary scheme, of which one main\r\nobject was to ruin Mr. Smith-Barry who owned the old Tipperary.\r\nAssassination was then only a political incident or instrument.  Mr.\r\nSmith-Barry, moreover, was hated not only as a landowner but for\r\nhaving organized the one efficient defence against the {257}\r\nspoliation of the landlords which down to that time had been\r\ndiscovered.  He had formed a company and raised a large sum of money\r\namong his English friends, he himself being the largest contributor.\r\nSo he held the O'Brien cohorts at bay; at what money cost and at what\r\npersonal risk few men knew.  But I apprehend that but for Mr.\r\nSmith-Barry the Plan of Campaign and New Tipperary would have\r\nsucceeded and the South of Ireland been handed over to the Land\r\nLeague.\r\n\r\nOne night as I was on my way from my room to the drawing-room, on the\r\nother side of the hall, I saw by the front door a big man in a blue\r\ncavalry cloak and cap, who had just entered.  He was laying aside his\r\ncloak as I passed, and took out of their holsters first one and then\r\nanother navy revolver, both seven-shooters.  I said, too flippantly:\r\n\r\n\"You take good care of yourself.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned on me sharply, with a questioning look of keen eyes under\r\nheavy eyebrows:\r\n\r\n\"Are you a friend of Smith-Barry?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hardly be staying in his house if I were not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I will tell you how you can best prove your friendship.  Get\r\nhim to carry what I carry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he in danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Danger?  There's a detective at this moment behind every tree about\r\nthe house, and even so we don't know what may happen.  We hope he is\r\nsafe here at home, but he goes about unarmed, and it is known he is\r\nunarmed, and no man who {258} does that can be sure of his life.  We\r\nhave tried our best to make him take care of himself.  He will not.\r\nNow do you try.\"\r\n\r\nThis sudden outburst, this appeal, this flash of light upon the scene\r\nwere all impressive.  The big man, it turned out, was the Chief\r\nConstable of the county.  He knew whereof he spoke.  I promised to do\r\nwhat I could and I talked with Mr. Smith-Barry.\r\n\r\nHe was a man equally remarkable for courage and for coolness, but in\r\nmatters affecting his personal safety he did not use the judgment for\r\nwhich in other matters he was distinguished.  He could not be\r\npersuaded that anybody would think it worth while to kill him.  He\r\nknew well enough that the shooting of landlords had become a popular\r\npastime, but he could not, or would not, understand why he himself\r\nshould be shot.\r\n\r\n\"I am on good terms with my tenants; my rents are fair rents; I evict\r\nnobody.  What have they to gain by shooting me?\"\r\n\r\nBut it was not from his own tenants that trouble was expected.  It\r\nwas not because Mr. Smith-Barry was not a good landlord, but because\r\nhe was the leader of the landlords in the South of Ireland, and the\r\nmost formidable opponent of the League that his life was threatened.\r\n\"It may be so,\" he said: \"but I think I will go on as I am.\"  And\r\nfrom that nobody could move him.\r\n\r\nNow, as it happened, shortly before I left London I had met one of\r\nthe chief officials in the Home Office who said to me:\r\n\r\n{259}\r\n\r\n\"You are going to Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but how do you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind how I know.  What I want to say to you is, Take a\r\nrevolver with you.\"\r\n\r\nI was on the point of making a light answer, but stopped.  If you get\r\na hint of that kind from a man who rules over the Criminal Department\r\nof the Home Office and the police generally, you accept it and do as\r\nyou are told.  I had a revolver with me, therefore, and when the time\r\ncame to go back to London I left it in its case on Mr. Smith-Barry's\r\nwriting-table, with a letter asking him to accept it from me and once\r\nmore begging him to carry it if only that it might be known that he\r\ncarried it, or if only out of his friendship to me.  This prevailed.\r\nHe wrote me that he still thought we made a needless fuss about it,\r\nbut he could not refuse the gift and he could not refuse to carry it.\r\nNo letter ever pleased me more.  I have never again seen my friend\r\nthe Chief Constable, but I have never forgotten him, and I think of\r\nhim now as a fine impersonation of that authority of the law which,\r\nin those turbulent days, he asserted and successfully maintained\r\nagainst great odds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{260}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nSIR WILFRID LAURIER AND THE ALASKA BOUNDARY\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe name of Empire-builder is used freely of late, perhaps too\r\nfreely.  It is so great a name that it ought to be kept for the great\r\nmen, for the real builders and creators; for Clive, for Rhodes, and\r\ntheir like.  There is another class, somewhat more numerous, but not\r\nmuch, who keep together the great Imperial patrimony which others\r\nhave handed down to them.  They might perhaps be called Wardens of\r\nEmpire, of whom Sir Wilfred Laurier may stand for an example.\r\n\r\nMy memories of Sir Wilfrid Laurier go back to those years when the\r\nAlaska boundary dispute between Canada and the United States\r\napproached its crisis.  Lord Minto was then Governor-General of\r\nCanada; Mr. McKinley was President of the United States; Mr. Hay was\r\nthe American Secretary of State.  There was strong feeling on both\r\nsides.  It appeared later that it was stronger in Canada than in the\r\nUnited States, but in both countries there was hot blood and in both\r\nthe controversy turned in part upon gold.  We were {261} carrying on\r\nunder a _modus vivendi_; a state of things which tended to\r\ntranquillize the minds of men.  But the _modus vivendi_ did not cover\r\nthe whole of the Alaskan territory then in dispute, and there was\r\nanxiety both at Washington and Ottawa.\r\n\r\nI went to Ottawa on a visit, spent a week at Government House, and\r\nthere first came to know Sir Wilfrid Laurier, who had been Prime\r\nMinister of the Dominion since 1896.  First impressions are best and\r\nI set down my first impressions, though they do not much differ from\r\nthe last, and though, in one way, they were wholly deceptive and\r\nmisleading.\r\n\r\nFor Sir Wilfrid came so softly into the drawing-room at Government\r\nHouse that you would never have thought him a leader of men.  He had\r\nsomething of the ecclesiastic about him, and something of the\r\ndiplomatist.  The first perhaps suggested itself because he was a\r\nRoman Catholic, and to that faith all my Puritan prejudices were\r\nalien.  As I think it over, I know of no fact in the current history\r\nof the British Empire more significant than the fact that the\r\ngreatest Dominion of this great British and Protestant Power should\r\nhave been governed for thirteen years by a Roman Catholic and a\r\nFrenchman.  That is Catholicism in its broadest sense, and not in the\r\nsense of mere loyalty to a Pope and to a particular Church.  Taking\r\nthe population of Canada as something over six millions to-day,\r\nnearly one half are Roman Catholics.  The other half are implacable\r\nProtestants.  How are they to live together in amity?  But they {262}\r\ndo, and one of the reasons of this amity is Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  If\r\nhe were a leader of men in the military sense, or as Chatham was a\r\nleader, one of two things would have happened.  Quebec and Ontario\r\nwould have quarrelled, or Sir Wilfrid would have ceased to be Prime\r\nMinister.  Booted and spurred and in the saddle--not so is Canada to\r\nbe ruled, nor are the conflicting interests and sentiments of the\r\neastern and western sections of the great Dominion so to be\r\nharmonized.  But the smooth subtlety of the priest and the suavity of\r\nthe diplomatist are means of conciliation.  Thus, I imagine, has Sir\r\nWilfrid worked.\r\n\r\nThus does he present himself to the company at Government House.  He\r\nglides into the room.  He is not humble; far from it, but his is\r\nperhaps the pride which apes humility.  Sweetness enters with him,\r\nand light, if I may once more unite rather overworked substantives\r\nwhich have come down to us from Swift.  He does light up the room as\r\nhe enters, and the faces of those who are already in it.  His coming\r\nis a delight to everybody and now we know what is before us.\r\n\r\nHis manner as he receives and returns the greetings of his friends is\r\ndistinctly French.  After all the guests have arrived and the\r\nGovernor-General and Lady Minto have entered the room, Sir Wilfrid's\r\nhomage to the representative of the sovereign and to Lady Minto has\r\nan essentially Parisian elegance.  Nobody would mistake him for an\r\nEnglishman by birth or race.  He is English politically and\r\nofficially; none more loyal to {263} the King of England and England\r\nherself than he; but personally he is French; taller, however, than\r\nthe average Frenchman, and of a larger frame.  The head is well set,\r\nthe forehead broad and high, a soft light in the eyes till something\r\nis said which sets them burning, the mouth firm, and the whole face,\r\nin contour and expression, quite as much that of the man of thought\r\nas action.  There are not many men of whom another man uses the word\r\ncharm but Sir Wilfrid is one; and women use it of him more freely\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nHe talked easily and well.  He speaks English and French with equal\r\nfluency, with finish also, and is never at a loss for an idiomatic\r\nphrase.  Yet the English is not quite the English heard to-day in\r\nLondon, nor is his French Parisian.  The Canadians have, in addition\r\nto many other kinds, the patriotism of language.  Quebec has its own\r\nFrench, the French of the eighteenth century or of Touraine to-day;\r\nand Toronto its own English, also now and then slightly archaic.  Yet\r\nin Toronto dwells, and has long dwelt, the first of living writers of\r\nliving English.  I mean Mr. Goldwin Smith; the fires of his\r\nintellectual youth still, at eighty-three, unquenched, and by another\r\nparadox the English author of the best political history of the\r\nUnited States.  Canada does not like his Canadian views, but they\r\nremain his views, just as he, for all his Canadian residence remains\r\nEnglish.[1]  Perhaps it is part of Sir Wilfrid's diplomacy that he\r\npractises both these varieties of French and English speech.  He\r\ntakes liberties {264} with each language, as a man who is master of\r\nboth is entitled to, and in each his soft tones are persuasive.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Mr. Smith died, June, 1910.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing seemed to come amiss to him.  The social topics of Ottawa\r\nhave not quite the same range as in London, but to the people of\r\nOttawa they are not less engrossing.  Even scandal was not unknown in\r\nthose days, and gossip floated about, and sometimes politics came to\r\nthe top, as they will anywhere when they are not too trivial, and\r\neven when they are.  Ottawa was, at any rate, with its fifty thousand\r\npeople and its lumber trade, the capital of Sir Wilfrid's kingdom.\r\nParliament was sitting in that finely placed Parliament House\r\ncrowning the cliff on the river, and all Canada was there, in the\r\nsubstantial persons of its delegates and Ministers.  Before I left I\r\ncame to know all, or nearly all, the Ministers.  Lunching one day\r\nwith Sir Wilfrid at the Rideau Club, I found myself in a group of a\r\ndozen or more political personages, all, I think, in office.  They\r\nstruck me as able men with a gift of businesslike talk.  But there\r\nwere not two Sir Wilfrid Lauriers.  The long reign of Sir John\r\nMacdonald had not proved fertile in new men.  Sir John was a sort of\r\nCanadian Diaz, and had done for the Dominion not what the President\r\nof the great Central American Republic had done for Mexico, but a\r\nservice not less personal and individual.  Both had been dictators.\r\nBoth had known how to use the forms of representative government in\r\nsuch a way as to consolidate and perpetuate arbitrary personal {265}\r\npower, and for something like the same period.  In a way, Sir Wilfrid\r\nhas done a similar thing, only you never could think a Minister of\r\nthese endearing manners arbitrary.  There is a more important\r\ndifference still.  Sir John Macdonald had organized political\r\ncorruption into a system.  Sir Wilfrid is free from any such\r\nimputation as that.  Charges have been heard against some of his\r\nMinisters; never against Sir Wilfrid.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps by accident that we began to discuss the Alaska\r\nboundary; or perhaps not by accident.  I do not know.  Thinking the\r\nmatter over afterward, it seemed possible enough that Sir Wilfrid had\r\nshaped events in his own mind from the first.  He may have been glad\r\nof an opportunity to communicate with Washington indirectly and\r\nunofficially, or desirous that the President should know what was in\r\nhis mind and learn it otherwise than via London.  He was very anxious\r\nas well he might be.  I had lately been in Washington and knew pretty\r\nwell the views of the President and of Mr. Hay.  I had made two or\r\nthree visits to Ottawa before the Alaska conversations with Sir\r\nWilfrid took place.  In the interval Mr. McKinley had ceased to be\r\nPresident.  He had been murdered by a foreigner with an\r\nunpronounceable name, and while the murderer was waiting in his cell\r\nto be executed the American women, suffragists of the militant kind,\r\nhad sent him, to quote an American writer, \"flowers, jellies, books,\r\nand sympathy.\"  The discipline of the prison did not forbid these\r\ngifts.  Mr. Roosevelt {266} had become President.  Mr. Hay remained\r\nSecretary of State, perhaps with a hand less free than he had under\r\nMr. McKinley, who was aware that he himself was not master of all\r\nsubjects or perhaps of any subject not essentially American.\r\n\r\nWhen the moment came Sir Wilfrid began casually enough, in a way that\r\nwould have allowed him to stop whenever he chose.  But he went on,\r\nand after a talk at Government House one day asked me to call on him\r\nat Parliament House on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThere again the talk continued, and it was followed by one still\r\nlonger when Sir Wilfrid came back to Government House next day with\r\npapers and maps.  Over these we spent some hours.  There were few\r\ndetails in all the complicated Alaska business which were not\r\nfamiliar to him; and of the whole question he had a grasp which made\r\ndetails almost unimportant.  His view struck me as reasoned,\r\ndetached, with a settled purpose behind it.  He was quite ready for\r\ncompromise.  I never knew a statesman anywhere who was not, with the\r\npossible exception of the ninety-two statesmen who compose the United\r\nStates Senate.  For myself, I had to look two ways.  I was obliged,\r\nthat is, to understand both points of view, the Canadian and the\r\nAmerican, for I was then the representative of _The Times_ in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nWhen we had gone over the whole matter I said to Sir Wilfrid that I\r\nthought I understood his opinions and the policy he desired to\r\nfollow.  But what was I to do?  Not a word of what he had {267} said\r\nto me could have been intended for print, nor can it be printed now,\r\neven after all these years and after the settlement.  But some object\r\nhe must have had, and I asked him if I was at liberty to draw any\r\ninference from these interviews.  I was leaving Ottawa the next day.\r\n\r\n\"Are you going to Washington?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall you see the President or Mr. Hay?\"\r\n\r\n\"Both.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if you think anything you have heard here likely to interest\r\nthe President or Mr. Hay, I don't see why you should not discuss the\r\nmatter with them as you have with me, if they choose.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of what happened at Washington I reserve for another\r\nchapter.  But Sir Wilfrid's way of dealing with the subject on this\r\noccasion may perhaps stand for an example of what I have called his\r\ndiplomatic manner.  He was not over-solicitous about precedents or\r\nformalities.  He was quite ready to avail himself of such\r\nopportunities as chance offered him, and of such instruments as came\r\nin his way.  His absolute good faith was beyond question.  If his\r\nsuggestions, or rather the frank statement of his own view and of\r\nwhat he was ready to do had proved acceptable at Washington, he would\r\nhave put them into official shape, and there would presently have\r\nbeen a dispatch from the Foreign Office to the State Department, and\r\nhistory would have been differently written.  Why this did not happen\r\nwill appear when the Washington end of the story is told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{268}\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLeaving Ottawa the day after the last of these conversations with the\r\nCanadian Prime Minister, I went to Washington.  There I saw both the\r\nPresident and Mr. Hay.  I said, of course, I had no authority to bind\r\nSir Wilfrid Laurier to anything, but I had a strong impression and\r\nthis impression I laid before them.  As a matter of convenience I had\r\ndrawn up a memorandum, of which I had sent Sir Wilfrid Laurier a\r\ncopy.  When Mr. Hay asked me whether I had any notes of my\r\nconversations with the Canadian Prime Minister I handed him this\r\nmemorandum; rather a long document.  He wished it read to him, and it\r\nwas.  Then we talked it over.  Mr. Hay said:\r\n\r\n\"I suppose you will see the President.  I shall see him also, but I\r\nthink it will be better you should make your statement to him\r\nseparately.\"\r\n\r\nMy belief is that both of them would have been disposed to consider\r\nthe Canadian Prime Minister's attitude a reasonable one, and if an\r\nofficial proposal in that sense had been made, and if it had rested\r\nwith the President to say yes or no, he would have accepted it.  But\r\nacceptance involved a treaty, and what was the use of agreeing to a\r\ntreaty which had to run the gauntlet of the United States\r\nSenate--\"the graveyard of treaties\"?  The Senate at that time was in\r\none of its most irreconcilable moods.  In truth, the President had\r\nfound himself more than once in collision with the Senate, and the\r\nmoment was not propitious.  Certain {269} Senators, moreover, had\r\nfixed opinions as to the proper disposition of this Alaska dispute,\r\nand from these opinions it was known they would not depart.  At\r\nanother time, when I hope to have something to say about Mr.\r\nRoosevelt, I may add a little, though not much, to this brief\r\naccount.  It can never be treated except with great reserve.\r\n\r\nI had told Sir Wilfrid when I said good-bye that I feared the Senate\r\nwould prove an invincible obstacle to an agreement.  I saw the\r\nPresident several times, and the whole matter was gone into.  After\r\nmy last conversation with him, which did not end till past one\r\no'clock in the morning, I wrote Sir Wilfrid that I saw no chance at\r\npresent of carrying the matter further.  He answered very kindly but\r\nregretfully, and so all this ended; without result for the time\r\nbeing.  I add only that the sagacity of the Canadian, the\r\nstatesmanlike sagacity, impressed the President and Mr. Hay alike.\r\nIf it had been possible to lay the whole story before the Senate, it\r\nmight have impressed that body also.\r\n\r\nBut Jefferson's phrase about government by newspapers applies, or\r\npart of it applies, to the Senate, or shall I say to part of the\r\nSenate?  Whatever is known to the Senate soon becomes known to the\r\nnewspapers.  A single illustration will suffice.  The Senate\r\ntransacts executive business in secret session.  The galleries are\r\ncleared; the Press gallery as well as the others.  But within an hour\r\nof the close of an executive session a full abstract of its\r\nproceedings is in the hands of the {270} Press agents.  Besides, I\r\nhad no authority to repeat what Sir Wilfrid had said to anybody but\r\nthe President and Mr. Hay.  Sir Wilfrid is a man so free from\r\nofficial pedantry or even conventionalities that I think it likely he\r\nwould have agreed to an informal communication to the Senate, but he\r\nwas not asked.  There was no occasion to ask him.  The objections\r\nwere too evident.  Mr. Hay said: \"Anything I favour the Senate will\r\noppose.\"\r\n\r\nOf the President some very leading Senators were not less suspicious.\r\nThere was to be no agreement until the Senate could dictate terms.\r\nThe subsequent agreement for an Alaska Boundary Commission was a\r\nSenate agreement.  It did not provide for arbitration.  If it had,\r\nthe Senate would have rejected it.  It was not supposed that a\r\ntribunal composed of three members from each side would reach a\r\ndecision.  All men now know that if it did it was because the Lord\r\nChief Justice of England conceived it to be his duty to vote in\r\naccordance with the facts and the law.  He had not laid aside his\r\njudicial character when he became a Commissioner.\r\n\r\nAs it was Lord Alverstone's vote which turned the scale in favour of\r\nthe United States, the Canadians attacked him with bitterness.  He\r\nmade one reply, and one only, and even this had no direct reference\r\nto Canada.  Speaking at a dinner in London he said: \"If when any kind\r\nof arbitration is set up they don't want a decision based on the law\r\nand the evidence, they must not put a {271} British judge on the\r\ncommission.\"  Writing as an American I think it due to Lord\r\nAlverstone to say that nothing ever did more to convince Americans of\r\nBritish fairness than his act.  It was his act also that put to rest\r\na controversy which, in the opinion of Canadian statesmen and\r\nAmerican statesmen alike, contained elements of the gravest danger to\r\npeace.  If he had done nothing else he would take his place in\r\nhistory as a great Lord Chief Justice.\r\n\r\nThe Briton is so constituted that it is probable he admires Lord\r\nAlverstone, formerly Richard and then Sir Richard Webster, almost as\r\nmuch for his renown in sport as for his professional eminence, of\r\nwhich to be Tubman and then Postman in the Court of Exchequer was one\r\npart.  He was, and is, an athlete, and used to win running races, and\r\nperhaps still could, being now only sixty-seven years of age.  You\r\nused always to hear him spoken of as \"Dick Webster.\"  At Cambridge\r\nUniversity he had such eminence in the study of mathematics as\r\nentitled him to be thirty-fifth Wrangler; and in the more humane\r\nletters so much proficiency as made him third-class classic.  In the\r\nSchools, that is, he was less energetic than on the track.\r\n\r\nBut success at the Bar does not depend on the Differential Calculus\r\nor on Latin and Greek.  Within ten years after being called he was\r\nQ.C., and having found a seat in Parliament, became Attorney-General\r\nin Lord Salisbury's Government in 1885-6.  Within seventeen years he\r\nhad reached the highest unjudicial place in his profession.  {272} He\r\nheld the same office three times; then was made Master of the Rolls;\r\nthe judge who in point of dignity comes next after the Lord\r\nChancellor and the Lord Chief Justice, and finally, in 1900, Lord\r\nChief Justice of England.  During his service at the Bar he had been\r\na great patent lawyer; with an income which rumour put at £30,000, or\r\n$150,000; for this country perhaps the maximum, outside of the\r\nparliamentary Bar.  Such is a bare outline of the career, in all\r\nrespects distinguished, honourable, stainless, of the man on whom\r\nCanada poured out criticisms which did not stop short of\r\nvituperation.  They need no answer.  If they did, it is not my place\r\nto answer them.  Not one human being in England believed Lord\r\nAlverstone capable of the dishonesty which the Canadian papers\r\nimputed to him.\r\n\r\nI am afraid I must add that Sir Wilfrid Laurier was one of Lord\r\nAlverstone's critics.  The feeling throughout Canada was so strong\r\nthat he had perhaps no choice, or no choice but between that and\r\neither resignation or defeat.  No pilot could weather that storm.\r\nThe feeling of Canada was emotional.  What he said, he said as Prime\r\nMinister.  Yet whether as Prime Minister or as Sir Wilfrid Laurier he\r\nmust have rejoiced in the settlement; even though it were at the\r\nexpense of Canadian claims.  I do not think Canada had any valid\r\nclaims, or had a case which before any impartial tribunal could have\r\nbeen maintained.  But whether she had or not, it was for her interest\r\nto see them once for all swept away and peace {273} and good feeling\r\nestablished between her and her neighbour.\r\n\r\nOur Canadian friends must have been aware at the time that they stood\r\nalone.  In their attacks on Lord Alverstone they had no backing in\r\nEngland.  No English newspaper ever suggested that Lord Alverstone\r\nhad voted otherwise than according to his conscience.  England knew\r\nhim to be incorruptible and unassailable, and laughed at the\r\nsuggestion that he did not understand the Canadian claims.  It was\r\nbecause he understood them that he decided against them.\r\n\r\nThe English, it is true, have thought themselves unlucky in\r\narbitrations, and have fallen into the habit of expecting an adverse\r\ndecision from an arbitration tribunal.  The Geneva tribunal instilled\r\ninto them that reluctant expectation.  But as this was not an\r\narbitration but simply a Commission for determining the true boundary\r\nline of Alaska, they accepted in a sporting spirit the judgment of\r\ntheir own Lord Chief Justice.  How could they do otherwise?  On the\r\nconstitution of the tribunal, and on the claims of Senator Lodge and\r\nSenator Turner to be impartial, they had remarks to make.  On the\r\nother hand, were the Canadian members impartial?\r\n\r\nThere can be no harm now in saying that Sir Wilfrid looked upon the\r\nAlaskan situation with gloomy forebodings.  So did everybody on both\r\nsides of the border; everybody who understood the situation and would\r\ngive himself the trouble to think, and had a sense of responsibility.\r\nIn the {274} disputed belt of territory, Alaskan territory which the\r\nUnited States claimed and Canada claimed, gold might at any moment be\r\ndiscovered.  There would come a rush from both sides.  We all know\r\nwhat the gold-miners are--a rough lot, not always recognizing any law\r\nbut the law of the strongest and the most covetous.  They make laws\r\nfor themselves, and even those they do not keep.  Many of them are\r\ndesperate, many ruined, many outlaws; many have no other hope than in\r\nfinding gold somewhere and getting it anyhow.  They are all armed.\r\nRevolvers are the arbitrators whose decisions they respect.  In the\r\npresence of new-found gold, what are boundaries or titles or\r\ninternational relations?  Inevitably they would cross the border into\r\nthe debatable land, Canadians and Americans alike.  What would the\r\nflag mean to bankrupt gamblers who saw once more the hope of riches?\r\nThere would be disputes.  There would be collisions.  At any moment a\r\nshot might be fired, and then what?  The risk was awful.\r\n\r\nThis, I have no doubt, was the risk Sir Wilfrid had in mind.  It\r\nmeant nothing less than the possibility of war between Great Britain\r\nand the United States.  Gold once discovered, the possibility became\r\na probability.  Could a Canadian statesman, could an American\r\nstatesman, think of that hazard and not be willing to do much, or\r\neven to concede much, in order to avert it?  Yet of all the men of\r\nboth nationalities with whom, then and after, I have talked about\r\nAlaska, Sir Wilfrid alone had a clear view of the danger, and he\r\nalone {275} was willing to do what was absolutely necessary to make\r\nwar impossible.  For that reason he stands forth a great patriot, a\r\ngreat Canadian, a great Englishman.  World-wide as is his fame he\r\ndeserves a greater.  It is not yet possible to do him full justice.\r\nIt may never be.  But his views and proposals and large wisdom, as\r\nthey were set forth in these conversations, put him, in my opinion,\r\nin the very front rank of statesmen of his time.  The impression they\r\nmade on the President and Mr. Hay was profound.  They too were\r\nstatesmen but their hands were tied.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be borne in mind that the North-western border was\r\nin a ferment.  That great belt of powerful States conterminous with\r\nCanada had long nursed its grievances.  The Alaska question did not\r\nstand alone.  It never has.  There were questions of duties, of\r\ntariffs, of lumber rights, of the rights of lake and canal\r\nnavigation, of fisheries, Atlantic and Pacific, and many\r\nothers--thirteen specific subjects in all.  They had once been all\r\nbut settled.  The High Commissioners in the last conference at\r\nWashington had come to terms on all but Alaska when, in an unlucky\r\nmoment, Lord Herschell, believing he could force the hand of the\r\nAmericans, put forth an ultimatum out of a blue sky.  It must be all\r\nor none.  There must be no settlement which does not include Alaska.\r\nLord Herschell had been thought of a contentious mind all through.\r\nAmericans bore with that, but to an ultimatum, an agreement at the\r\nmouth of a gun, we would not submit.  So {276} the whole went off.\r\nWhat was the result?  There came a time when Sir Wilfrid himself had\r\nto announce that there would be no more pilgrimages to Washington.\r\nNor have there been.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{277}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nANNEXING CANADA--LADY ABERDEEN--LADY MINTO\r\n\r\nThe first person from whom I heard of the American immigration into\r\nCanada was Sir Wilfrid Laurier.  He told me it had begun quietly, a\r\nfew American farmers drifting across the border in search of better\r\nand cheaper land than could be had at home.  There was no sound of\r\ndrum or trumpet.  These men had nothing to do with the talk of\r\nannexation.  They had no political object.  Their object was\r\nagricultural; only that and nothing more.  It is possible enough that\r\nthe reputed riches of the North-west province of Canada had something\r\nto do with the policy, if it can be called a policy, of the American\r\nannexationists, desiring to fire the hearts of the farmers in\r\nIllinois and Minnesota who saw the yield of their wheat lands\r\ndiminishing yearly.  It seems never to have occurred to the\r\npoliticians that the farmers were quite capable of looking after\r\ntheir own interests, and that it was cheaper to buy land than to make\r\nwar for it.\r\n\r\nThe movement had, at the time of this conversation in 1902, been\r\ngoing on for years.  Beginning by scores, it had risen to hundreds\r\nyearly, then {278} thousands.  Sir Wilfrid computed that there were\r\naltogether some fifty or sixty thousand American settlers in the\r\nCanadian North-west, and that the yearly exodus from \"the States\" had\r\nreached six thousand.\r\n\r\n\"But does not that raise or threaten to raise a political issue?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is much too soon to think of that.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I imagine Sir Wilfrid did think of it, and it may have\r\nbeen present to Lord Grey's mind when he launched his memorable\r\ndeclaration at the Waldorf Hotel two years later.  Now, the number of\r\nAmericans who are moving northward and acquiring Canadian soil is\r\ncomputed at a hundred thousand yearly or more.  The political\r\ndifficulty, if there were one, would seem to be met by the Canadian\r\nlaw allowing aliens to hold land but requiring them to become\r\nCanadians at the end of three years.  I am told there is such a law\r\nbut I do not know.\r\n\r\nIn truth, the political difficulty has never outgrown manageable\r\nlimits.  There has always been more or less \"tall talk\" about\r\nannexing Canada.  Eloquent phrases have been heard--\"One continent,\r\none flag,\" or \"the Stars and Stripes from the Gulf of Mexico to the\r\nArctic Circle.\"  But no party has taken up this cry.  One newspaper\r\nin New York, _The Sun_, did for a time preach annexation.  _The Sun_\r\nis a journal which does not disdain sensations, and has taught its\r\nreaders to expect them, and from time to time fulfils the\r\nexpectations it excites.  The editor at that time was {279} Mr. Paul\r\nDana, son of the Mr. Charles A. Dana who made _The Sun_ a powerful\r\njournal.  Mr. Paul Dana started a society to promote the acquisition\r\nof Canada.  The capital of the society was $125,000, or £25,000.\r\nThat was the sum which Mr. Paul Dana and his friends thought\r\nsufficient, or were able to raise, if they did raise it, to sever\r\nfrom the British Empire a Dominion larger than the United States\r\nwithout Alaska, capable, in military opinion, of self-defence, but,\r\nin any case, with the military and naval power of Great Britain\r\nbehind it.  Mr. Paul Dana, however, did not pursue matters to the\r\nbitter end.  He has ceased to be editor of _The Sun_ and Canada\r\nremains British.  I do not know whether his annexation society is\r\nstill in existence.  But the American appetite for Canada, never\r\nkeen, has grown duller still.  Men's minds turn to other things.  The\r\nPhilippines and Hawaii and Porto Rico and the defence of the Pacific\r\nCoast are more than enough to occupy our attention.  The Senate\r\nitself has grown tractable, and on the chief points of difference an\r\nagreement has been reached where five years ago no agreement seemed\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nTwo years after Sir Wilfrid Launer became Prime Minister the somewhat\r\nagitated and perhaps agitating Governor-Generalship of Lord Aberdeen\r\ncame to an end.  I suppose the cause of the troubled waters on which\r\nthat particular ship of State was tossed was not to be found wholly\r\nor mainly in Lord Aberdeen himself, but in the multitudinous energies\r\nof Lady Aberdeen.  Her {280} convictions were strong, her zeal was\r\ncontinuous, her certainty of being in the right was a certainty she\r\nshared with her sex, or with all those women who think public affairs\r\ntheir proper sphere.  She had many admirable qualities and a courage\r\nwhich shrank from no adventure merely because it was an adventure.\r\n\r\nHer zeal in the cause of Home Rule for Ireland is well known.  It had\r\nbeen shown in Dublin.  It was shown now at Ottawa.  It crossed the\r\nborder and hung out a flag in Chicago.  In the Chicago Exhibition,\r\nor, as it was officially called, the \"World's Columbian Exposition,\"\r\nin 1893, there was, among other attractions, an Irish village.  This\r\nvillage Lady Aberdeen took under her patronage, and over it she\r\nhoisted an Irish flag of the kind in which the Home Rule heart\r\nrejoices; a flag with the Harp but without the Crown.  If Lady\r\nAberdeen had done this as a private individual it could hardly have\r\nbeen allowed to pass.  But she did it as wife of the Governor-General\r\nof the Dominion of Canada.  There were official remonstrances and the\r\nflag was lowered.  Against an indiscretion of that kind may be set\r\nmany useful and charitable enterprises, begun or encouraged by this\r\nlady in Ottawa and all over Canada.  She is kindly remembered there,\r\nand her visits to Canada since Lord Aberdeen ceased to be\r\nGovernor-General have been welcomed.  But there are many stories of\r\nher crusading spirit besides the one I have told, and I suppose the\r\nCanadians really like to live a more peaceful life {281} than they\r\nwere allowed to when Lady Aberdeen ruled over them.\r\n\r\nLord Minto succeeded Lord Aberdeen.  Sir Wilfrid Laurier was Prime\r\nMinister during the whole of Lord Minto's term, and Mr. Chamberlain\r\nwas Secretary for the Colonies down to the last year.  I suppose it\r\nmay be remarked that seldom have three great officials worked in a\r\nharmony more complete than did these three.  It can hardly be\r\nnecessary to say anything of Mr. Chamberlain except this; that his\r\nmasterfulness never made itself felt in Canada in such a way as to\r\nweaken, but always in such a way as to strengthen, the tie between\r\nthe Motherland and the Colony.  His Imperialism took account of the\r\nDominion as well as of the Empire; it took equal account for all\r\npurposes.  It was under this strong hand that Canada felt her\r\nindependence, perhaps for the first time, completely safeguarded.\r\n\r\nBetween Lord Minto and Sir Wilfrid Laurier there was on all subjects\r\nan understanding.  That is not the same thing as saying they never\r\ndiffered, which would be absurd.  But they had before them the same\r\nhigh objects, and they pretty well agreed as to the means of\r\nattaining them.  The relations between Government House and\r\nParliament House, where the Prime Minister had his headquarters, were\r\ncordial, frank, unrestrained, and delightful.  That there should be\r\nrelations of that kind between the representative of the Crown and\r\nthe representative of the Dominion is of equal advantage to the Crown\r\nand to the {282} Dominion.  They have not always existed, but there\r\nseems every reason to believe they will exist in the future, as they\r\ndid in Lord Minto's time, and as they do now that Lord Grey speaks\r\nfor the Sovereign and Sir Wilfrid Laurier is still the trusted Prime\r\nMinister of a Dominion which has grown too great to be called a\r\nColony.\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned Lady Aberdeen, I may say a word, though for a\r\ndifferent reason, about Lady Minto, who for six years was the idol of\r\nOttawa and of the whole Dominion.  If ever there was an example of\r\ntact and felicity in the discharge of the duties that fall to the\r\nwife of a Governor-General, Lady Minto was that example.  What need\r\nbe added except that the statement is not a compliment but a\r\ntestimony?  The Canadian Press has paid its tribute and there are\r\nother tributes.  One is that in Quebec and Toronto, the capital of\r\nthe French Roman Catholic province and the capital of the British\r\nProtestant province, Lady Minto was equally popular and equally\r\nbeloved.  In a very literal but strictly correct and conventional\r\nsense it may be said that she was a power in the Dominion.  The\r\nreceptions at Government House were very interesting; perhaps\r\nsometimes curious as an example of democracy undergoing a social\r\nevolution.  In all the Commonwealths beyond the seas the same\r\nprocess, I presume, may be studied.  When Lady Carrington issued\r\nthree thousand invitations to a reception at Government House in\r\nSydney the limit had perhaps been reached for the time.\r\n\r\n{283}\r\n\r\nThere can be no such throng at Government House in Ottawa because it\r\nis not large enough; perhaps is not quite large enough for the\r\ndignity of the Dominion in these days of its amazing growth and\r\never-increasing importance.  But Ottawa, though a flourishing city,\r\nis not a great city.  It is a compromise capital; the middle term in\r\nwhich the rivalries of Quebec on the one hand and Toronto on the\r\nother found a means of peace on neutral and central ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{284}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTWO GOVERNORS-GENERAL--LORD MINTO AND LORD GREY\r\n\r\nLord Minto has now passed from the great post of Governor-General of\r\nthe Dominion to the still greater Viceroyalty of India.  But I\r\napprehend it will be long before his reign in Canada is forgotten.\r\nPossibly the Canadians might not use, and may not like, the word\r\nreign.  They are a susceptible as well as a great people.  They are\r\njealous of their liberties, which are in no danger, and of the word\r\nAmerican, to which they have some claim, over-shadowed though it be\r\nby their greater neighbour on the South.  I have seen more instances\r\nthan one of Canadian sensitiveness, of which I will take the\r\nsimplest.  Having to pay for a purchase in an Ottawa shop I asked the\r\nshopkeeper whether he would take an American banknote.  He answered\r\nwith a flushed face:\r\n\r\n\"We consider our money as much American as yours.  We have the same\r\nright as you to the name American.\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means.  But what do you call our money?\"\r\n\r\n\"United States bills.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you call me?\"\r\n\r\n{285}\r\n\r\nBut to that simple question he had no answer ready.  And I rather\r\nimagine the time has come, or is coming, when the Canadian may be as\r\nproud of the name which identifies him with the northern half of the\r\ncontinent as we are of the adjective we have to share, more or less,\r\nwith others.  I never heard of a Mexican calling himself an American,\r\nbut I believe the Latin races to the South do; and forget sometimes\r\nto put South before it.  Lord Minto was Governor-General while Mr.\r\nChamberlain was Colonial Secretary, a period of transition, of\r\nImperial transition, to which Mr. Chamberlain led the way.  Nobody\r\nhas ever forgotten his adjuration to all Englishmen to think\r\nimperially.  As I remember Canada during several visits, she was at\r\nthat time more inclined to think independently.  Not that any party\r\nin the Dominion meditated a secession from the Empire, but there was\r\na pretty distinct notion, and claim, of colonial autonomy.  Canada\r\ncame first, as Canada, and not as a part of the Empire.  The moment\r\nwhen Imperial considerations first became dominant in the Canadian\r\nmind was moment of the Boer War.\r\n\r\nThere it is that Lord Minto's name becomes indissolubly allied with\r\nthe Dominion.  His share in that great transaction of the Canadian\r\ncontingent to South Africa has never, I think, been fully understood\r\nby the British public.  Nor would it ever be if the matter were left\r\nto him.  He was never a man to advertise himself or his deeds.  I\r\ndare say he will not like my telling the story, {286} though I shall\r\ntell it only as it was told to me, and the teller had nothing to do\r\nwith Government House.\r\n\r\nIt was for a while doubtful whether Canada would send troops.  There\r\nwas, I am told, an uncertain feeling about the militia organization,\r\nthen on a different footing from the present.  There were awkward\r\nstories of corruption and inefficiency.  It was doubted whether a\r\nforce officered and equipped in conditions then existing would do\r\ncredit to the Dominion.  There were hesitations on other grounds.\r\nBut when finally a levy was voted, Lord Minto, who had taken no part\r\nin the discussion and could take none, availed himself of his\r\nauthority as Governor-General and of his experience as a soldier, and\r\ngave his personal attention to the organization of the contingent.\r\nIt was stated to me much more strongly than that, and my informant\r\nseemed to doubt whether Lord Minto did not exceed, or at least\r\nstrain, his prerogatives as representative of the Crown.  If he did,\r\nso much the better.  The English have ever liked a servant in high\r\nplace who was not afraid of responsibilities.  But for my purpose it\r\nis enough to say that Lord Minto took an active part in these\r\nmomentous preparations.  I think no officer was appointed without his\r\nsanction, no contract for supplies entered into which he did not\r\napprove, no arrangement of any kind made but upon his initiative or\r\nwith his express consent.\r\n\r\nThe result was that the Canadian forces reached Africa a body of\r\nsoldiers fit for the field, {287} not as a mere aggregation of men\r\nfood for powder.  England knows, and all the world knows, what\r\nservice they did.  There were no better troops of the kind, perhaps\r\nnot many of any kind better adapted for the work they had to do and\r\nfor coping with such an enemy as the Boers.  They did more than their\r\ncontract called for in the field.  They builded better than they\r\nknew.  They made it plain to all men that the country which had sent\r\nsuch troops as these many thousands of miles beyond the seas to the\r\nrelief of the Imperial forces of Great Britain was itself an integral\r\nand indispensable part of the Empire.\r\n\r\nWhereas, if they had failed or only half succeeded, they would have\r\ndone little good to the British arms in South Africa and none at all\r\nto the Imperialism of which Canada to-day is a bulwark.  And if this\r\nis a true account, as I believe it to be, of the way in which these\r\ntwo great results were brought about, the credit of them belongs more\r\nto Lord Minto than to any other man.\r\n\r\nI do not offer this as an explanation of the regard in which Lord\r\nMinto was held.  It could not be an explanation, because it was not\r\ngenerally known.  There were other reasons, at the top of which I\r\nshould put his common sense, his sincerity, and, of course, that\r\ndevotion to duty which every Governor-General is presumed to possess,\r\nwhich in him was conspicuous.  Everybody liked him, nobody doubted\r\nhim.  He made the interests of Canada his own.  He traversed that\r\nvast territory from end to end again and again.  He held a {288}\r\nCourt not in Ottawa only, but in Quebec, in Halifax, in Toronto, and\r\nin that Far North where Canada touches Alaska and the chief harvest\r\nof the soil is gold.  His five years' term came to an end but the\r\nColonial Office and Parliament House and the people of Canada wished\r\nhim to stay on, and so the five years became six.  A period on which\r\nto look back with pride.\r\n\r\nCanada is again fortunate in her Governor-General, and in his\r\nrelations with those who mould public opinion on the American side of\r\nthe border.  I imagine it may not be known in England how he first\r\nconquered the respect and good-will of the Americans.  It was at a\r\ndinner of some five hundred or six hundred people at the Waldorf\r\nHotel in New York.  In the course of his short speech Lord Grey\r\nreferred, with a plainness unusual in those exalted regions, to what\r\nhad been said in times past about the possible absorption of Canada\r\nby the United States.\r\n\r\n\"But now,\" observed the Governor-General, \"there is no more reason\r\nfor discussing the annexation of Canada by the United States than for\r\ndiscussing the annexation of the United States by Canada.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a straight hit from the shoulder, but the audience rose to it\r\nand cheered him as I had heard no Englishman cheered in New York\r\nbefore that time.  He became in a moment a great figure, filling the\r\npublic eye.  He delivered his tremendous sentence with simplicity and\r\ngood humour.  There was nothing like defiance or menace.  {289}\r\nEverybody saw that he felt himself on a level with his hearers.  He\r\nspoke as Governor-General of the Dominion to the people of the United\r\nStates, _d'égal à égal_.  He spoke as an Englishman to Americans.\r\nMr. Price Collier may say, if he chooses, that English and Americans\r\ndo not like each other, but I will ask him what other two\r\nnationalities have the same, or anything like the same, points of\r\ncontact and of sympathy?  There stood Lord Grey, just an Englishman,\r\nholding out his hand to his American cousins.  If the hand happened\r\nfor that moment to be clenched it was none the less a greeting, and\r\nwas understood as such.  You could not look into his face without\r\nseeing in it the spirit of kinship and of friendship.  Lord Grey is\r\npre-eminently one of those men who think the best relations between\r\nmen or between communities must spring from frankness.  He wanted to\r\nclear the ground, and he did clear it.  If he had asked anybody's\r\nadvice he would certainly have been advised not to say what he did.\r\nHe preferred to trust to his own instincts, and they proved to be\r\ntrue instincts.  The danger was that a freedom of speech which would\r\nbe accepted from his lips might be resented when read in cold print.\r\nBut it was not.\r\n\r\nNo American will have forgotten Lord Grey's gift of his portrait of\r\nFranklin to Philadelphia.  That endeared him to us still further.  It\r\nwas a prize of war which he surrendered, taken in the War of the\r\nRevolution by General Sir Charles Grey.  It used to hang near the\r\nceiling in one of {290} the reception rooms of Howick House,\r\nNorthumberland.  I saw it there some time before the gift and Lord\r\nGrey told me its history, but did not tell me he meant to give it\r\nback to America.  I believe he did ask whether I thought Philadelphia\r\nwould care to have it again, a question to which I could not but say\r\nyes.  Yet it might almost be thought of the family, with a good deal\r\nmore than a hundred years of possession behind it.  But in this\r\ncountry a hundred years do not count so much as elsewhere.  The\r\nEnglish have long since got into the habit of reckoning by centuries.\r\n\r\nWhen Lord Grey went to Washington the President asked me to bring him\r\nto the White House.  Mrs. Roosevelt had a reception that evening and\r\nI said with her permission I would bring him then.  \"Very good,\" said\r\nthe President, \"and mind you bring him to me as soon as you come.\"  I\r\ndid as I was told.  The President greeted him, as he did everybody,\r\nwarmly, but in a way that made Lord Grey understand he was welcome.\r\nWithin thirty seconds they were deep in political economy, a matter\r\nof which Lord Grey had made a profounder study than the President.\r\nFor the Englishman had not, like Bacon and Mr. Roosevelt, taken all\r\nknowledge to be his province, and was able to master his subjects.\r\nMore than once I had occasion to see something of his familiarity\r\nwith difficult subjects--once at dinner when the late Mr. Beit, the\r\nSouth African magnate, sat on his right, and the two discussed\r\nfinancial and political questions.  Mr. Beit had made a great {291}\r\nfortune in South Africa, and Lord Grey had not.  The Chartered\r\nCompany had not then proved a mine of wealth to its administrator.\r\nBut the minds of the two were at one.  The knowledge of each was\r\nimmense.  The power of grappling with great subjects was common to\r\nboth.  Perhaps Lord Grey sometimes took an imaginative view, but the\r\nfeet of the capitalist were planted on the solid earth.\r\n\r\nThe President and the Governor-General became friends at once,\r\nneither of the two being the kind of man to whom friendship requires\r\nlength of years to come into being.  It is, of course, for the\r\ninterests of both Canada and the United States that relations of\r\nsympathetic good-will should exist between the rulers of each.  A few\r\nhours before their meeting the President knew nothing about Lord\r\nGrey.  Even to Mr. Roosevelt's omniscience there are limits.  But he\r\ndesired to know, and when he had heard a little of Lord Grey's\r\nhistory, said joyfully: \"All right; we have subjects in common and\r\nideas too.\"  So the doors of the White House opened wide to the\r\nGovernor-General, and Lord Grey was the President's guest, and the\r\nimpression in Canada was a good impression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{292}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nLORD KITCHENER--PERSONAL TRAITS AND INCIDENTS\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Lord Kitchener's refusal to accept the\r\nMediterranean post to which he was assigned has impaired his\r\npopularity or diminished the general confidence in him.  Possibly\r\neven official confidence survives, in a degree.  The tone of the\r\nPrime Minister's replies to questions about the refusal may denote\r\nresentment but hardly censure.  So I think I may still venture to\r\nreprint sundry personal reminiscences which were written before this\r\ncollision between the great soldier and the Prime Minister--or was it\r\nthe War Minister?--had occurred.\r\n\r\n\"The greatest chief-of-staff living,\" said the Germans of Lord\r\nKitchener; possibly with a reservation in favour of themselves.  They\r\nwould not go beyond that limited panegyric.  The remark was made by a\r\nGerman officer, high in rank, not long after the Boer war, and it was\r\nPaardeberg which rankled in his German mind and would not suffer him\r\nto award to the English general a great power of leadership in the\r\nfield.  But I believe German opinion on that battle has {293} since\r\nundergone revision.  Whether it has or not Lord Kitchener's military\r\nrenown can easily take care of itself; nor is it his soldiership\r\nwhich I am going to discuss.  I happen to have met him now and then,\r\nand what else I have to say about him is personal.  I hope not too\r\npersonal.\r\n\r\nIt was on a journey from London to Alderbrook, Mr. Ralli's beautiful\r\nplace in Sussex, that I first saw Lord Kitchener.  We were a week-end\r\nparty and went down together in a saloon carriage.  The figure which\r\nnext to Lord Kitchener's stands out clearest is the late Lord\r\nGlenesk's still in the vigour of his versatile powers and\r\naccomplishments and attractions.  The occasion was the more\r\ninteresting because Lord Kitchener had then lately returned from\r\nEgypt, and from that victorious campaign which he, and he alone, had\r\nplanned and carried through from beginning to end in strict\r\nfulfilment of the scheme framed before the actual preparations for it\r\nhad been begun.  This also might induce our German military friends\r\nto reconsider that chief-of-staff opinion above quoted.\r\n\r\nIt was known that this second hero of Khartoum--Gordon being the\r\nfirst--was to travel by this train.  It was an express, and there was\r\nno stop before Guildford.  But consider the enthusiasm of the British\r\npeople when they have a real hero.  The stations through which the\r\ntrain thundered at forty miles an hour were crowded with people.\r\nThey could not get so much as a glimpse of their idol, but they stood\r\nand cheered and waved their hats to the train and the invisible\r\nhero-traveller.  {294}\r\n\r\nWhen we reached Guildford six or seven thousand people thronged that\r\nstation.  They hurrahed for \"Kitchener,\" and as the cries for\r\n\"Kitchener\" met with no response, they were raised again and again.\r\nLord Kitchener sat in a corner, buried in a rough grey overcoat,\r\nsilent and bored.  He had no taste for \"ovations\" and triumphal\r\ngreetings.  Lord Glenesk told him he really must show himself and\r\nacknowledge these salutations.  So Lord Kitchener rose, with an ill\r\ngrace, walked to one of the open doors of the saloon, raised his hand\r\nwith a swift military jerk to his bowler, and retreated.  The tumult\r\nincreased but he would not show himself a second time.  The cheers\r\nrolled on without effect.  The idol would not be idolized.  It was\r\nnot ill-temper but indifference.  He was in mufti and it was the\r\nsoldier the multitude demanded to see.  In truth, Lord Kitchener's\r\nappearance at the moment was not military.  It was remarked by his\r\nfellow-passengers that he showed to little advantage in his grey\r\nclothes, none too well fitting.  When evening came he was another\r\nman, just as unmistakably the soldier as if in full uniform.\r\n\r\nHe was at that time brooding over his Gordon College scheme for\r\nKhartoum.  He wanted £100,000, and he doubted whether he should get\r\nit.  In vain his friends urged him to make his appeal.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Lord Kitchener, \"nothing less than £100,000 will be of any\r\nuse.  It is a large sum.  I should not like to fail, and if they gave\r\n{295} me only part of the amount I should have to return it.\"\r\n\r\nHe was told that his name would be enough.  It was the psychological\r\nmoment.  Delay would only injure his chances.  Lord Glenesk offered\r\nhim £1000 across the dinner table, and other sums were offered there\r\nand then, and the support of two powerful newspapers was promised.\r\nStill he hesitated, and still he repeated, \"I should not like to\r\nfail.\"  At last one of the company said:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Lord Kitchener, if you had doubted about your campaign as you\r\ndo about this you would never have got to Khartoum.\"\r\n\r\nHis face hardened and his reply was characteristic of the man:\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps not; but then I could depend on myself and now I have to\r\ndepend on the British public.\"\r\n\r\nBut he did ask for the money and got all and more than all he wanted\r\nwith no difficulty whatever.  It appeared that the British public\r\nalso was to be depended on.\r\n\r\nThe United States Government was at this time in some perplexity\r\nabout the Philippines, where matters were not going well.  Lord\r\nKitchener asked what we were going to do about it and how we meant to\r\ngovern the 1200 islands.  He seemed to think they were giving us more\r\ntrouble than they ought.  I explained that the business of annexing\r\nterritory on the other side of the globe was a new one to us, that\r\ndown to within a few years the American Republic was self-contained,\r\n{296} that we had therefore no machinery for the purpose, no civil or\r\nmilitary servants intended or trained for distant duties, no\r\ntraditions, no experience of any kind, and no men.  Whoever went to\r\nthe Philippines had to learn his business from the beginning, and the\r\nbusiness was a very difficult one.\r\n\r\nLord Kitchener listened to all this, thought a moment, looked across\r\nthe table, and said: \"I should like to govern them for you.\"  And\r\nalthough it was not said seriously and could not be, it was evident\r\nthat Lord Kitchener would very well have liked to take over a job of\r\nthat kind had it been possible.  His mind turned readily to\r\nexecutive, administrative, and creative work.  The task of reducing\r\neight or nine millions of Filipinos and other races to order was one\r\nfor which he was fitted.\r\n\r\nNot long after that, an American who had already once been Civil\r\nGovernor of the Philippines for a short time resumed that post and\r\nheld it for two years.  He won the confidence of the people.  Out of\r\nchaos he brought order.  He set up an administrative system.  He\r\ntreated the natives justly.  He brought them to co-operate with their\r\nrulers.  When he left, he left behind him a Government incomparably\r\nbetter than the islands had ever known.  Life, liberty, property, all\r\ncivil and personal rights, were protected.  Progress had begun.\r\nTrade and commerce had begun to flourish and have continued to\r\nflourish so far as tariff conditions permit.  Loyalty, a sentiment\r\n{297} never before known, though a plant of slow growth, prevails.\r\nRebellions are at an end.  The name of the American who accomplished\r\nall this, or laid the foundations of it all within two years, is\r\nTaft.  He is now President of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw Lord Kitchener was at a house in one of the\r\nSouthern counties, in 1902.  He was then on his way to take up the\r\ncommandership-in-chief of India.  He drove over to luncheon from\r\nanother house some sixteen miles away.  Luncheon, usually at 1\r\no'clock, had been put off till 1.30 because of the distance he and\r\nhis friends had to drive; a great concession.  But the roads were\r\nheavy and they arrived just before 2.  Lord Kitchener said to me as\r\nwe were going in: \"Look at me.  I really cannot sit down to lunch in\r\nall this dirt.\"  I suggested that he should come to my room.  He did,\r\nand after spending ten minutes on his toilet emerged looking not much\r\nless the South African campaigner than when he began.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"You don't seem to approve.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I was only wondering what you had been doing for ten minutes.\r\nBut late as we are there is one thing you must see.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I took him to the hall where stand those two figures in\r\ndamascened armour inlaid with gold, Anne de Montmorenci and the\r\nConstable de Bourbon, whom a Herbert of the sixteenth century had\r\ntaken prisoners.  They woke the soldier in this dusty traveller.\r\n\r\n{298}\r\n\r\n\"If I were a Frenchman I think I should try to get them back.\"\r\n\r\n\"It has been tried.  One of their descendants offered £20,000 for the\r\npair, but you see they are still here.\"\r\n\r\nWe found the rest of the company at table, where a place next his\r\nhostess was waiting for him.  If you had seen Lord Kitchener for the\r\nfirst time you would have felt that his toilet did not much matter.\r\nThe man's personality was the thing.  There are many men who produce\r\nan impression of power, but with this man it was military power.  You\r\ncould not take him for anything but a soldier.  Not at all the\r\nsoldier as he presents himself to the youthful imagination.  He was\r\nnot in uniform; no English soldier ever is except on duty or on\r\noccasions of ceremony.  But it is possible to be a soldier without\r\ngold lace or gilt buttons, and to appear to be.  The carriage of his\r\nhead, rising out of square shoulders, announced him a soldier; so did\r\nhis pale grey-blue, steel-blue eyes, and the air of command; a quite\r\nunconscious air for the simplicity of his bearing was as remarkable\r\nas anything about him.  It has been said he is not a natural leader\r\nof men, not a man whom other men follow in the field just because\r\nthey cannot help it; that he does not \"inspire\" his soldiers.  I\r\ndoubt it; but even were it so he is a man whose orders other men must\r\nobey when they are sent.  His pale steel-blue eyes have in them the\r\nhard light of the desert.  I believe, in fact, the light of the\r\ndesert, which we consider a poetic thing, injured {299} his eyes.\r\nBut there is in them that far-off look as of one whose sight has\r\nranged over great spaces for great intervals of time.  The races of\r\nSouth-eastern Europe and of Central Asia have it.  There has been\r\nseen in London a beautiful girl who has it; gazing out, from the\r\ngraceful movement of the waltz, on a distant horizon much beyond the\r\nwalls of a ballroom.\r\n\r\nYet as Lord Kitchener sits there talking at luncheon the hardness of\r\nthe face softens.  The merciless eyes grow kindly and human; you may\r\nforget, if you like, the frontal attack at Paardeberg and the\r\ncorpse-strewn plains of Omdurman, and remember only that an English\r\ngentleman who has made a study of the science of war sits there,\r\ndevoting himself to the entertainment of two English ladies.  It is a\r\npicture which has a charm of its own.  And it is a Kitchener of whom\r\nyou hear none too often.  That is why you hear of him in these social\r\ncircumstances from me.  Most men have a human side to them.  Even\r\n\"K.\" has, and sometimes allows it to be seen.\r\n\r\nHe had a human side when he departed without leave from the Military\r\nAcademy at Woolwich to take a look for himself at what was going on\r\nnear the French frontier in July or August 1870, when the Prussians\r\nwere giving their French neighbours a lesson in the art of war that\r\nseemed to young Kitchener a lesson likely to be more profitable than\r\nthose of Woolwich; so he went.  It was a grave breach of discipline.\r\nI never heard how the matter was settled but it {300} did not keep\r\nKitchener out of the army for he entered the Royal Engineers the next\r\nyear.  But I imagine we all like him the better for such an adventure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{301}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n  SIR GEORGE LEWIS--KING'S SOLICITOR AND FRIEND\r\n  A SOCIAL FORCE\r\n\r\nLord Russel said of him:\r\n\r\n\"What is most remarkable in Lewis is not his knowledge of the law,\r\nwhich is very great, nor his skill in the conduct of difficult\r\ncauses, in which he is unrivalled, nor his tact, nor his genius for\r\ncompromise.  It is his courage.\"\r\n\r\nThat was said not long after the Parnell trial, in which Lord\r\nRussell--then Sir Charles Russell and afterwards Lord Chief Justice\r\nof England--who had long been at the head of the English Bar of his\r\nown time, proved himself the equal of any advocate of any time.  Yet\r\nhe must divide the honours of that trial with Sir George Lewis.  The\r\nprofession, or the two professions of barrister and solicitor,\r\ndivided them if the public did not.  The public has almost never the\r\nmeans of judging.  The work of preparing a great cause is carried on\r\nin the solicitor's office.  The barrister takes it up ready made and\r\nthe way in which he handles his material is seen of all men.  But no\r\nbarrister badly briefed could make much of a complicated case.  In no\r\ntrial was this truer than in the Parnell trial.  Parnell was perhaps\r\nthe greatest political {302} leader of his time, and the least\r\nscrupulous.  He had a black record, and the men behind him a blacker.\r\nNot even Sir George Lewis could wash it all white, but without him\r\nthe judgment would have gone far more heavily against the Irish\r\ndictator.  And if ever there was a case in which Lord Russell's\r\neulogy on Sir George Lewis was to the point it was the Parnell case.\r\nIt needed all his courage in handling facts to save his client from a\r\ncondemnation which would have carried with it his banishment from\r\npublic life.  Mr. Gladstone marked his sense of the service done by\r\nmaking Mr. George Lewis Sir George Lewis.  The knighthood some years\r\nlater became a baronetcy, the late King, I believe, suggesting it.\r\n\r\nFor the late King, while Prince of Wales, had stood to the great\r\nsolicitor in the relation of client, and this business connection had\r\nbecome one of friendship.  They were much together at Homburg, where\r\nboth spent three or four weeks each year for many years.  Homburg is\r\na place where the houses are of glass and everything is known.  The\r\nPrince gave his dinners at Ritter's or at the Kursaal in the open\r\nair.  If he went afterward to play whist--for these were ante-bridge\r\ndays--at Mr. Lewis's rooms, that was known.  Nor is publicity, so far\r\nas Prince and King are concerned, much less in England, and when Mr.\r\nLewis dined at Marlborough House, or was present at a levee at St.\r\nJames's Palace, or was a guest at Sandringham, all these things were\r\nof common knowledge.  And since the English are a very loyal people,\r\nwho {303} had a strong personal attachment to their late King, the\r\nconfidence and liking the King showed him won for Sir George the\r\nconfidence and liking of others.\r\n\r\nThis great and eventful career has lasted more than fifty years, and\r\nwith the end of 1909 Sir George Lewis, being seventy-six years old,\r\nretired from business, leaving his son, Mr. George Lewis, and his\r\nother partner, Mr. Reginald Poole, both for many years his\r\nassociates, to be his successors.  Both are widely known as learned\r\nand skilful in the law; both have been trained in Sir George's\r\nmethods; and the new firm is still, like the old, known as Lewis &\r\nLewis, and they are still of Ely Place, Holborn.\r\n\r\nIt is characteristic of old days and ways in London that Sir George\r\nLewis was born in one of the three houses now occupied by the firm.\r\nHis father was a solicitor before him; a man of repute and ability,\r\nyet none the less is this vast business the creation of the son.\r\nThere are in London many firms of solicitors known the world over;\r\nthe Messrs. Freshfield, for example, solicitors to the Bank of\r\nEngland.  But there is seldom or never a fame due to one man.  It is\r\ndue to combined action, to organization, to concentration upon one\r\nkind of business.  The firm of Lewis & Lewis knew no limitations.\r\nThe public thought of Sir George Lewis as the man to whom the conduct\r\nof great causes was habitually entrusted; sometimes criminal,\r\nsometimes social, often divorce cases, often those causes in which\r\nthe honour of a great name {304} or a great family is involved.\r\nTrue, but the business of Messrs. Lewis & Lewis was first of all a\r\ngreat commercial business.  Sir George's permanent clients were among\r\nthe city firms famous in finance, or in banking or in industry.  That\r\nwas the backbone of the business and continues to be.\r\n\r\nThe first case in which Mr. Lewis made himself known to the public\r\narose out of the failure of Overend, Gurney & Co., then one of the\r\nleading houses in the City of London.  He fought that case\r\nsingle-handed against barristers of renown; a bold thing for a\r\nsolicitor to do, and perhaps without precedent.  He did the same\r\nthing in the Bravo murder case, and held his own, and more than his\r\nown, against Attorney-General and Solicitor-General.  No doubt, had\r\nhe chosen, he might have gone to the Bar and become distinguished at\r\nthe Bar, but not so had he chosen to model his life.  He never could\r\nhave played the part he has, had he done that.  For the dividing line\r\nbetween solicitor and barrister in England is just as clearly drawn\r\nas ever.  You may be one or the other; you cannot be both; you may\r\npass from one to the other, but you must elect between the two.\r\n\r\nI ask myself sometimes what London society would be to-day had there\r\nbeen no Sir George Lewis.  It certainly would not be what it is.\r\nThere have been many, many _causes célèbres_ in which his name has\r\nfigured in open court, or in the still more open newspapers.  But\r\nthey are as {305} one to a hundred of those which have never been\r\ntried, and never supplied material for legal proceedings or for\r\nprinted scandal.  The simple truth is that Sir George Lewis, though\r\nthe most successful of solicitors in contested causes, has made fame\r\nand fortune by keeping cases out of court and out of print.  He\r\ncarried the art of compromise to its highest point.  He saw that\r\nalike in the interests of his clients and of the public, and in his\r\nown interest also, the greatest service he could do was to prevent\r\nlitigation.  On that he has acted consistently for fifty years.\r\n\r\nOf how many lawyers can anything like that be said?  Sir George Lewis\r\nstands alone.  The money results of his policy are splendid.  His\r\nrenown is splendid.  But the misery he has soothed and the social\r\ndisruptions and disturbances and far-reaching disasters he has\r\nprevented are a tribute more splendid still.  And perhaps never has\r\nthe value of his advice been so evident as when it has been rejected.\r\n\r\nIn the matter which shook London society perhaps more than any other\r\nof recent years, Sir George Lewis on one side, and a brilliant young\r\nsolicitor, Mr. Charles Russell, son of the late Lord Chief Justice,\r\non the other, had come to an agreement.  The instrument they had\r\ndrawn jointly was ready for signature.  So quietly had all this\r\ndistressing business been transacted that, had the instrument been\r\nsigned then and there, the world would never have heard there had\r\nbeen a disagreement till it learned there had been a settlement.\r\n{306} But outside influences intervened.  One of the two signatures\r\nwas withheld.  Then scandal broke loose and the sewers of London\r\noverflowed all winter.  There were reproaches, recriminations,\r\ndivisions; all London taking one side or the other.  Then in the\r\nspring the same instrument, word for word, was signed.  The\r\nsolicitors had never wavered nor perhaps ever doubted that since they\r\nwere agreed their clients must ultimately agree.  It is a typical\r\nexample of Sir George Lewis's methods.  But the mischief that had\r\nbeen done by intruders could not be undone.\r\n\r\nSleeping for half a century, or for only years and months, in the\r\nblack japanned tin boxes which line the walls in Ely Place and in his\r\nsafes were papers enough to compromise half London and scandalize the\r\nother half.  Sir George, reflecting some years ago on this state of\r\nthings, looked through the collection and then burnt the whole.  That\r\nis the best possible answer to the foolish story that he intended\r\nwriting his memoirs.  His sense of professional etiquette and his\r\nsense of honour may both be judged in the light of these flaming\r\ndocuments.  It had been necessary, of course, to preserve some of\r\nthese papers for a time, on the chance of their being needed again.\r\nBut think of the relief with which hundreds and hundreds of people\r\nheard of the burning!  It is almost as if the tragedies of which all\r\nrecord was thus destroyed had never happened.[1]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] I have since asked Sir George himself about this conflagration\r\nstory.  He answered: \"Yes, it is true, but there are things\r\nhere\"--touching his forehead--\"which I can neither burn nor forget.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n{307}\r\n\r\nSir George Lewis could coerce as well as coax.  He could use threats,\r\nbut never a threat he was not ready to fulfil.  By and by his\r\ncharacter came to be so well understood that a letter from Ely Place\r\nbecame almost a summons to surrender.  But always on reasonable\r\nterms.  With all that, he had a kindness of heart to which thousands\r\nof people can testify.  I suppose no lawyer ever did so much for\r\nclients without fee or reward.  If you were his friend, if you were\r\nof a profession, if you came to him with a letter from some friend,\r\nif you came to him in poverty with a case of oppression, he would\r\ntake infinite pains for you and no fee.  He had all sorts of\r\nout-of-the-way knowledge; copyright law, for one, on which he was an\r\nauthority, and in which few solicitors are authorities.  There is\r\nthis link between copyright in books and in plays and theatrical\r\ncontracts; the contract is commonly drawn by the publisher or\r\nmanager, who is a man of business; and the author or actor, who is\r\nnot, is expected to accept it.  It was this solicitor's pleasure to\r\nredress that balance.\r\n\r\nHe was a law reformer.  Again unlike most successful men who are apt\r\nto be content with things as they are.  The letters he wrote to _The\r\nTimes_ on such matters as the creation of a Court of Criminal Appeal,\r\nalteration in the law of divorce, the administration of Justice, and\r\nother high legal questions show him a great scientific lawyer, with a\r\nmastery of principles.  He has essentially a legal mind, and he wrote\r\nwith a luminous precision and force not always characteristic of the\r\nlegal mind.  And he had what every {308} judge on the bench ought to\r\nhave, and a few of the greatest really have, an unerring perception\r\nof such facts as are essential, and a power of dismissing all the\r\nrest.  Sir George Jessel had that; one of the greatest judges.\r\nStudents of ethnology may remark with interest that both were Jews.\r\nWhen such a man quits the stage it is an irreparable loss to his\r\nfriends, to his clients, and to the world generally.  The feeling is\r\nmore than regret, for ties are broken which never existed before and\r\nwill never exist again.  Sir George Lewis's position was unique\r\nbecause his personality is unique.  So will his fame be.  Reputation\r\nin the law is for the most part transitory.  But this will endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{309}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nMR. MILLS--A PERSONAL APPRECIATION AND A FEW ANECDOTES\r\n\r\nI recross the Atlantic for a moment.  There died lately in California\r\na man known on both sides of the ocean, known in more worlds than\r\ntwo, one of the strongest and certainly one of the most amiable\r\nfigures in the world of business, Mr. Darius Ogden Mills.\r\n\r\nOf late years, since Mr. Reid has been Ambassador, Mr. Mills had\r\nbecome a figure in London.  He interested Englishmen because he was a\r\nnew type, or, rather, because he was individual; because he was Mr.\r\nMills.  Type implies a plurality; and not only was there but one\r\nMills, there was none other to whom you could compare him.\r\nEnglishmen have formed a notion of their own about Americans of the\r\nclass to which, in respect of his wealth, Mr. Mills belonged; and a\r\nhigh notion.  They have seen much, for example, of Mr. Pierpont\r\nMorgan, and they seemed inclined to suppose all great financiers to\r\nbe, in manner as in fact, masterful, dominating, huge in physique,\r\nborn rulers of other men.  They had never seen much, if anything, of\r\nMr. Harriman, who hid away his great qualities beneath a personality\r\n{310} almost insignificant in appearance save for the ample head and\r\nburning eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Mills was perceived to be like neither of these, nor like any\r\nthird.  He was much more like an Oxford professor; like the late Rev.\r\nMark Pattison, rector of Lincoln, the Casaubon of George Eliot's\r\nnovel.  Mr. Mills had the gentleness, the refinement, the distinction\r\nof the scholar.  It must have been born with him.  He went to no\r\ncollege.  He had little college learning.  He had lived in rough\r\ntimes and among rough men; had twice crossed the continent on foot\r\nand in the saddle, with a cloud of Red Indians ever on the horizon,\r\nand had lived in San Francisco during those stormy years when Bret\r\nHarte's heroes, gamblers, and ruffians set up their turbulent rule.\r\nBut there was a light in Mr. Mills's pale blue eyes which kept those\r\ngentlemen at a distance.  This delicately-featured face ended in a\r\njaw which was an index of a character not to be trifled with.\r\n\r\nUpon all this London remarked with some surprise, and then with great\r\nrespect and liking.  They liked his simplicity of manner as much as\r\nhis sagacity of speech, and his silence almost as much as his\r\nconversation.  An American who was an American to the finger-tips but\r\nnever waved the flag; a man of affairs who seemed in the world only a\r\nman of the world; a millionaire in whose pockets the jingle of the\r\ndollar was never heard; such was the rare picture Mr. Mills\r\npresented.  He won their sympathies because he never tried to.  These\r\nislanders like a man who is just {311} himself, yet is absolutely\r\nfree from self-assertion.  They gave him first their respect, then\r\ntheir regard, and finally their affection.\r\n\r\nI have seen all these feelings shown in the Metropolitan Club in New\r\nYork in an unusual way.  Mr. Mills used to come into the card-room of\r\nan afternoon.  There would be two or three or more rubbers of bridge\r\ngoing on.  Bridge is a passion, but men would stop in the middle of a\r\nrubber and ask Mr. Mills if he would not take a hand or make up a new\r\nrubber.  Bridge being not only a passion but the selfish game it\r\nis--necessarily so, like business--the tribute was a remarkable one.\r\nIf he declined, somebody would remember suddenly he had an engagement\r\nand beg Mr. Mills as a favour to take his place.  As he moved about\r\nin the club men rose and walked across the room to greet him, a thing\r\nless rare in New York but unknown in London, where a club has been\r\ndefined as a place in which a man may cut his best friend and no\r\noffence taken.  The general ceremoniousness of club life in New York\r\nwould close all the clubhouses in London.  So would the despotism of\r\nNew York club committees.\r\n\r\nMen listened to him or waited for him to speak in a way which\r\nsuggested not only a desire for an opinion but an attachment to the\r\nman.  He himself was one of the best listeners ever known.  When he\r\nspoke it was briefly.  He could say what he wanted to in a sentence\r\nor a few sentences.  In this he was like another and a greater Oxford\r\nDon--I suppose the greatest of his time--Jowett, {312} the Master of\r\nBalliol.  Both sat long silent while others were talking and both\r\nseemed to use, and Jowett certainly did use, the interval in\r\nfashioning his thoughts into epigrams.  Jowett's epigrams often\r\nstung, and were meant to sting, for he thought presumption and\r\nignorance ought to be punished.  Perhaps Mr. Mills did but he did not\r\nthink he had been appointed to punish them.\r\n\r\nA group of men in the club were one day discussing great fortunes and\r\nthe men who owned them.  Everybody thought and spoke in millions and\r\ntens of millions.  Finally some one appealed to the only silent man\r\nin the company.\r\n\r\n\"What do you say, Mr. Mills?\"\r\n\r\n\"I say that in all these cases, or almost all, I think it safe to\r\ndivide the figures by two.\"\r\n\r\n\"In your own case also?\"\r\n\r\n\"Above all in my case.\"\r\n\r\nWe travelled up together once by the night express to the Adirondacks\r\non a visit to Mr. Reid's camp, arriving at the station at six in the\r\nmorning; then driving to the lake; then in a boat to the camp, which\r\ncould not be reached otherwise.  After his long night journey he was\r\nfresh and alert and not the least tired, and he talked freely.  He\r\neven discussed business, and presently remarked:\r\n\r\n\"I have been a little anxious about money matters and was not sure I\r\ncould get away from New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but my bank balances are much larger than I like them to be.\"\r\n\r\n{313}\r\n\r\nI made the obvious and rather foolish answer that there were plenty\r\nof people who would be willing to relieve him from this anxiety, to\r\nwhich he retorted:\r\n\r\n\"You know nothing about it.  I am not speaking of myself.  But a man\r\nin my position has his duties as trustee for others to consider.\r\nWhether I get three per cent or four per cent for my money may not\r\nmuch matter, though I prefer five, but to many of those for whom I\r\nact it does matter, and to them I am under an obligation I must\r\nfulfil.  No man who is not or has not been in business can have any\r\nnotion of the ramifications and complications of business.  But it's\r\nworth your while to consider that.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the longest speech I had ever heard him make, and the didactic\r\ntouch at the end was equally new.  It was not his way to lecture\r\npeople.  He held strong, considered opinions on many subjects, but\r\nthought it no part of his duty to impress them on the world, though\r\nhis sure judgment was at the service of his friends.  His fame and\r\nwealth and position had come to him from what he had done, not by\r\nsermonizing or rhetoric.  Men trusted him.  There was perhaps no man\r\nmore generally trusted.  It is nothing to say he never betrayed a\r\ntrust.  He discharged it to the utmost measure of his ability.  The\r\nmoney which others had put into his hands had to earn as much as\r\nmoney could earn.  Three per cent on deposits would seem to an\r\nEnglishman affluence, but Mr. Mills appeared to think he was unfair\r\nto his clients to be content, {314} even temporarily, with three when\r\nit could be invested to earn more.\r\n\r\nAt the camp he talked more freely than elsewhere.  The air was tonic;\r\nthe life suited him.  In the Adirondacks you do get back into closer\r\nrelations with Nature and on more intimate terms with the great\r\nnatural forces about you.  This is true in spite of the luxurious\r\nsimplicity of the camps.  But Mr. Mills was always happy where his\r\ndaughter was.  I may not dwell on such a matter but her devotion to\r\nhim was the light of his life.  He came to London to be with her.\r\nShe returned to America to be with him.  If his duties and\r\nresponsibilities had permitted, his visits here would have been\r\nlonger and more frequent.\r\n\r\nOnce while I was sitting with him in his office in Broad Street his\r\nlawyer came in with a contract for him to sign.  Mr. Mills hardly\r\nglanced at it, took up his pen to sign, stopped, and said to the\r\nlawyer:\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is all right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, Mr. Mills.  I think you will find your interests protected\r\nin every way.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is not what I mean.  I want to know whether you have drawn this\r\nagreement so as to leave Mr. A a profit large enough to ensure his\r\ndoing his best.  He must have his fair share.\"\r\n\r\nA business view, perhaps, and for aught I know common in the business\r\nworld, but I had never happened to hear it put quite like that, nor\r\nhave I since.\r\n\r\nWith that may be compared another saying.  A little company, all men\r\nof business but me, were {315} discussing business methods.  One or\r\ntwo of them stated rather crudely what are sometimes called the\r\nmethods of Wall Street.  \"There is no sentiment in business,\" said\r\none.  \"A man who thinks of others' interests will soon have none of\r\nhis own to consider,\" remarked a second.  And a third, whose career\r\nwas strewn with wrecks, declared: \"Of course you have to crush those\r\nwho stand in your way.\"  Said Mr. Mills:\r\n\r\n\"I have done pretty well in business but I never crushed anybody.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mills hotels were an expression of his sentiment toward the\r\nsociety amid which he lived; to the environment which had given him\r\nhis later opportunities.  He wanted to enlarge the opportunities of\r\nother men, to sweeten their lives a little, to enable them to do more\r\nfor themselves.  His scheme was derided and was a success from the\r\nstart, and the success has grown greater ever since.  The success was\r\ndue to the patience with which he thought out his plans.  The\r\nafternoon before I sailed from New York, in 1906, I met Mr. Mills in\r\nhis victoria at the door of the Metropolitan Club.  \"Come for a drive\r\nin the park,\" he said, and we went.  He began at once to talk about\r\nhis new hotel.  We drove for two hours and during nearly all that\r\ntime he discussed plans, estimates, details, methods of economical\r\nworking, organization, the effect on the tenants, and a hundred other\r\nmatters relating to the building, equipment, and operation of the\r\nhotel soon to be erected.\r\n\r\nHe had all the facts and figures in his mind.  He {316} talked with\r\nan enthusiasm he rarely showed.  His heart was in it.\r\n\r\nTo the last his energies seemed inexhaustible; and his interests.  He\r\narrived one afternoon at Dorchester House at five o'clock from New\r\nYork.  There was a large dinner at 8.30, then a ball which he did not\r\nleave till toward one in the morning.  I met him again at tea next\r\nday and he told me he had been at the White City since nine that\r\nmorning, and when I suggested that he had gone about that marvellous\r\nbut very fatiguing show in a chair, he said: \"Oh, no, on my legs.\"\r\nNor did he seem tired nor mind the prospect of another large dinner\r\nthat night.  He was then eighty-two years old.  Pneumonia had\r\nattacked him winter after winter, but he always rallied and would\r\ntake no better care of himself than before.\r\n\r\nIn that slight, erect figure Nature had packed powers of endurance\r\nwhich bigger frames had not.  Everything was reduced to its essence.\r\nThere was nothing superfluous and nothing wanting.  The features were\r\nsculptured.  It was the face of a man who had a real distinction of\r\nnature; who had benignity and judgment and acute perceptions all in\r\nequal measure.  They bore the stamp of an impregnable integrity, as\r\nhis life did.  Unlike qualities in him melted into harmony and a\r\nrounded whole.  For with his unyielding firmness and strength and\r\nuncompromising convictions and invincible sense of justice went a\r\nloving kindness which made him the most lovable of men.  That was Mr.\r\nMills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{317}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nLORD RANDOLPH CHURCHILL--BEING MOSTLY PERSONAL IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\nI venture on an anecdote or two, which I have told elsewhere but\r\nimperfectly, those whom it concerns being now dead or retired.  They\r\nwere three; Mr. Chamberlain, Lord Randolph Churchill, and Mr.\r\nArchibald Forbes; all at that moment in the splendour, the blinding\r\nsplendour, of their gifts and powers.  It was after luncheon.  The\r\nladies had gone.  Lord Randolph had been Secretary of State for\r\nIndia, and Forbes, like Lord Randolph, had lately been in India, and\r\nthe talk turned upon India.  All three were men who spoke their\r\nminds; not at all an uncommon practice in this country, where men\r\ndissent freely, and even bluntly, from the expressed opinion of\r\nothers, and no offence taken.  Lord Randolph and Forbes differed\r\nsharply.  Neither stood in awe of the other, or of any man.  Forbes\r\nwould make a statement.  Lord Randolph would answer:\r\n\r\n\"I know you have been in India but from what you say I shouldn't\r\nsuppose you knew where it was.\"\r\n\r\n{318}\r\n\r\nLord Randolph would go on to point out what he thought Forbes's\r\nmistakes; then Forbes:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you have ruled India but the real India is a sealed book to\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so on.  Presently they discussed the Indian Civil Service and Mr.\r\nChamberlain came to the front.  In the new Civil Service lay, he\r\nthought, the hope of India.  Appointments were no longer jobbed.  A\r\nnew class of men were brought into the service by examination, well\r\ntaught, well trained, competent, and drawn from the whole people of\r\nEngland.  Lord Randolph listened impatiently, interrupted now and\r\nthen, but on the whole listened.  When Mr. Chamberlain had finished\r\nLord Randolph burst out:\r\n\r\n\"I have heard that before.  No greater nonsense was ever talked.\r\nWhat is the Indian Civil Service; or rather, what was it?  A boy of\r\ntwenty went out as a clerk.  From Calcutta he was sent up country,\r\nnominally in charge of a bureau, really to govern a district.  He did\r\ngovern it.  He had passed no examination.  Very likely he couldn't\r\ntell you the date of the battle of Plassey or the lineage of a native\r\nPrince.  He had no mathematics, no Latin, and probably couldn't\r\nspell.  But he had character.  He knew how to govern because he came\r\nof a governing class.  And he was a gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whereas now\"--looking steadily at Chamberlain--\"instead of gentlemen\r\nyou get men from--Birmingham and God knows where.\"\r\n\r\nChamberlain, who seldom declined any {319} contest to which he was\r\ninvited, sat cool and smiling while Lord Randolph launched his\r\nshafts.  When he had emptied his quiver the member for Birmingham,\r\nstill cool and smiling, observed that he thought it was time for us\r\nto join the ladies; and we did.  Instantly the sky cleared.  India\r\nwas forgotten.  The two combatants walked upstairs arm in arm, and\r\nthe storm was as if it had never been.\r\n\r\nThe little scene in which Lord Randolph Churchill was the chief actor\r\nbrings that vivid personality once again vividly to mind.  Indeed, it\r\nis never long absent from the general memory.  He has left a mark on\r\nthe public life of this country which will last as long as anything\r\nlasts.  And he has left a portrait of himself in the memory of all\r\nwho really knew him.  Besides which, he has left a son who does not\r\nallow us long to forget his existence or his relation to the affairs\r\nof the moment.  A great authority was quoted quite lately as saying,\r\n\"Winston is an abler man even than his father.\"  I asked him whether\r\nhe said it.  \"No, I said cleverer, not abler,\" which seemed a very\r\njust distinction.\r\n\r\nI have not really much to add to the account of Lord Randolph which I\r\nwrote in January, 1895, upon his death.  I adhere to all I then said.\r\nThe estimate seems to me fair, if not complete.  The years that have\r\npassed take nothing from Lord Randolph's fame.  If anything, they add\r\nto it.  And for this reason: his conception of the political future\r\nof his country was a true conception.  {320} To him the year 1884,\r\nwith its revolutionary enlargement of the suffrage, was the turning\r\npoint of modern English history.  The middle classes vacated the\r\nthrone they had occupied since 1832.  The working classes succeeded\r\nto their inheritance.  Their power has steadily grown.  They are\r\ntwo-thirds of the electorate to-day.  They have, it is true, but 30\r\nout of 670 Members of Parliament, but these figures are in no respect\r\nrepresentative of their real authority.  They and the Irish\r\nNationalists hold the balance of power in the House of Commons.  They\r\nreturned fewer members to the House this year than in 1906, but that\r\nwas because of an arrangement between them and the Liberals--for\r\nvalue received.  And no man doubts that the power of the Labour Party\r\nwill hereafter increase and not decrease.  For the first time in the\r\nhistory of England they openly proclaim their purpose to legislate\r\nand to influence legislation in the interest of a single class and\r\nnot in the interest of all classes and of the country as a whole.\r\nTheir excuse is that they are a majority.  But the day when a\r\nmajority takes no account of the minority, or thinks a minority has\r\nno rights which the majority is bound to respect is a black day in\r\nthe history of any country.\r\n\r\nBut this, in substance if not in detail is what Lord Randolph foresaw\r\nand announced; and he was the only man to foresee it.  He did not\r\ndisdain, as Mr. Gladstone did, to look ahead, to form to himself some\r\nconception of what the future of England was to be with this rising\r\ntide of Democracy.  {321} His conception, as I said, was a true\r\nconception, and the political genius of the man was never more\r\nclearly visible than in this forecast, and in the means he proposed\r\nto himself and to his party for dealing with a situation absolutely\r\nnew.\r\n\r\nLord Randolph's Dartford speech in 1886 will therefore remain a\r\nmonument to his sagacity.  It was a speech which may be read to-day\r\nwith profit and admiration.  So may that at Birmingham, of which\r\n\"Trust the People\" is the motto.  I will go farther.  If I wanted a\r\nbody of political doctrine to put into the hands of an American\r\nstudent of English politics I would as soon offer him Lord Randolph's\r\nspeeches as any other.  There is no complete collection but there are\r\nthe two volumes edited by Mr. Louis Jennings and published by Messrs.\r\nLongmans in 1889.  They cover a period of only nine years, 1880-8,\r\nbut they are a handbook to the political life of England for a\r\ngeneration.  Lord Randolph had this rare merit--rare in this\r\ncountry--he dealt habitually with principles, and his treatment of\r\npolitical questions was not empirical but scientific.  And he was\r\nabsolutely fearless.\r\n\r\nHe was fearless alike in public and private, and he looked his own\r\nfortunes in the face whether they presented themselves to him with\r\nthe promise of good or of ill.  He knew he was a doomed man.  He cast\r\nhis own horoscope shortly before he flung that fatal card upon the\r\ntable which lost him the game in his long contest with Lord\r\nSalisbury.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"I shall be five years in office or in opposition.  {322} Then I\r\nshall be five years Prime Minister.  Then I shall die.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he was right as to the length of his life though a perverse fate\r\nand his one fatal miscalculation, \"I forgot Goschen,\" falsified the\r\nrest of his prediction.  Mr. Winston Churchill queries this saying\r\nbut I am inclined to think it authentic.\r\n\r\nMany of these matters I used to hear Lord Randolph discuss in\r\nprivate, and even now I suppose they must remain private though the\r\nimpression his talks left may fairly be described.  I listened to his\r\nviews on finance--long before he was Finance Minister--through nearly\r\nthe whole of a long summer afternoon.  We were at Cliveden.  That\r\nbeautiful possession had not then passed into Mr. Astor's hands.  It\r\nstill belonged to the Duke of Westminster, and had been lent by him\r\nto the Duchess of Marlborough--widow of that seventh Duke of\r\nMarlborough who was Viceroy of Ireland--and Lord Randolph's mother.\r\nThe Duchess was a woman who may always be adduced in support of the\r\ntheory that qualities of mind and character descend from mother to\r\nson.  She was a woman of great natural shrewdness and force, with an\r\ninsight into the true nature of such things as interested her; and\r\nthe one thing that interested her above all others was her second\r\nson, Lord Randolph.\r\n\r\n\"Come for a drive after lunch,\" said Lord Randolph, and we went in a\r\ndog-cart to Burnham Beeches and Taplow and elsewhere for many miles\r\nand hours through the woods which are one {323} of the glories of\r\nthat delightful country.  It was a perfect afternoon.  You were not\r\nthe least disposed to ask with Lowell, \"What is so rare as a day in\r\nJune?\"  Rather:\r\n\r\n  In the afternoon they came unto a land\r\n  In which it seemed always afternoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd always June.  That is one of the enchantments of this versatile\r\nclimate.  When in a good mood you think it will be always good.  And\r\nthe enchantments in and about Cliveden were many and to-day are many\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nTo all of them Lord Randolph seemed for the moment insensible.  His\r\nmind was upon Finance, and upon Finance he discoursed during the\r\nbetter part of three hours.  To the sunlight and the flower-strewn\r\nhedges and the far-stretching forests he paid no more attention than\r\nhe did to his driving.  The horse took his own pace, and being a\r\nwell-trained animal showed a sensible preference for his own side of\r\nthe road.\r\n\r\nLord Randolph's talk was not much more than thinking aloud.  His\r\nfinancial opinions which became afterward, like those of all\r\nChancellors of the Exchequer, rigid, were in process of formation.\r\nNow and then he asked a question about the Treasury in America but\r\nfor the most part his monologue was a soliloquy.  I know few things\r\nmore instructive than to see a mind like his at work.  He thought as\r\nhe talked on, but the sentences fell from his lips clean-cut and\r\nfinished.  He {324} was not announcing conclusions nor laying down\r\nlaws.  Finance was then comparatively new to him.  He would take up\r\nany idea or view as it occurred to him, hold it before him, look at\r\nit from all sides, and either drop it or put it on a shelf till he\r\ncould see how it fitted with the next.  I said as he pressed a\r\nproposal--I have forgotten what:\r\n\r\n\"You break with all tradition.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you suppose I am here for?  Have you ever known me to adopt\r\nan opinion because somebody else had adopted it?\"\r\n\r\nAnd in truth I had not, nor had any one.  Part of his charm lay in\r\nhis independence; and a large part.  He was fettered by no\r\nrestrictions nor overborne by any authority.  Once only, as he told\r\nme at another time, did he find himself \"in the presence of a\r\nsuperior being,\" Mr. Gladstone, to wit.  \"I could argue, but before\r\nthe man himself I bent.\"  But I have related that story in the paper\r\nreferred to above.  Yet we find Lord Randolph telling Prince\r\nBismarck, who asked him whether the English people would exchange Mr.\r\nGladstone for General Caprivi:\r\n\r\n\"The English people would cheerfully give you Mr. Gladstone for\r\nnothing but you would find him an expensive present.\"\r\n\r\nOf Prince Bismarck, however, Lord Randolph seems not to have received\r\nthe same impression he did of Mr. Gladstone, high as is the tribute\r\nhe pays him.  There had been a little friction.  In 1888, in Berlin,\r\nPrince Bismarck had refused to see {325} Lord Randolph, or to meet\r\nhim at lunch at Count Herbert's, and he calls the great Chancellor a\r\n_grincheux_ old creature who kept away because Lord Randolph had used\r\nall his influence \"to prevent Lord Salisbury from being towed in his\r\nwake.\"  But at Kissingen, in 1893--Lord Randolph, alas, being no\r\nlonger in a position to influence, nor Prince Bismarck, alas, any\r\nlonger Chancellor of the Empire he had created--there was a meeting.\r\nLord Randolph wrote an account of it to his mother, and the letter, a\r\nmost picturesque letter, is given in the _Life_.  Lord Randolph felt\r\nthe fascination the Prince could exercise when he chose, and pays due\r\ntribute to him.  But it is admiration, not awe, he feels in the great\r\nGerman's presence.  In truth, Lord Randolph had said savage things of\r\nPrince Bismarck in days past, as well as of Mr. Gladstone.  \"If you\r\nwant to sup with him you must have a long spoon.\"\r\n\r\nThe domestic and personal side of Lord Randolph had a fascination\r\nquite other than that of his political life.  Simplicity was one note\r\nof it; that and the absolute freedom from affectation which is\r\nnatural to a man whose courage is equal to every demand.  I began\r\nmeaning to be domestic and personal but I shrink from saying most of\r\nthe things I should like to.  Two summers in succession he had an old\r\nElizabethan house near Egham, known as Great Forsters; the house\r\nstill encompassed by a moat, mostly dry.  I had always thought him at\r\nhis best in his own home, where, whoever might be his guest, he\r\nrecognized {326} his obligations as host, and his manner softened and\r\nthe lawlessness of his tongue was restrained.\r\n\r\nThis impression grew stronger with these visits.  It happened that\r\ntwo of their guests, his and Lady Randolph's, were attractive to both\r\nof them as well as to the rest of the world.  The two were the\r\nbeautiful Duchess of Leinster and Sir Henry Drummond Wolff.  The\r\nDuchess of Leinster was at that time in the full splendour of her\r\nloveliness.  I had never seen her except at a ball or dinner or on\r\nsome other social occasion, in the glory of a toilet and of her\r\nshoulders and diamonds, when she was perhaps the most resplendent\r\nobject to be seen in London.  At Great Forsters she went about during\r\nthe day in the simplest of gowns.  She was less dazzling but not less\r\ncharming.  As for Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, he and Lord Randolph set\r\neach other off.  Their intimacy was both political and personal.  If\r\nI may use such a word of two men, I should say they were on\r\naffectionate terms.  Both of them were capable of cynicism but that\r\nonly made their affection the more striking.  There were no ties of\r\nblood but as you looked on this little group and listened to their\r\ntalk, which was both easy and brilliant, you felt as if you were\r\npresent at a family gathering.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nLord Randolph Churchill despised two things which (I am told) are\r\nmuch respected in the {327} United States; public opinion and money.\r\nOf course, in public life he had to take account of public opinion\r\nand he was a very good judge of it, and in 1886 he taught his party\r\nto take account of it.  But what I mean is that, while he admitted\r\nand asserted the necessity of calculating forces as the first\r\nbusiness of a statesman, he was never subservient to that majority\r\nwhich he sought to make his own.  He was not frightened by names and\r\nhe did not shrink from unpopularity.  He told Prince Bismarck at\r\nKissingen that nobody in England cared a rap what the papers said,\r\nwhich meant that he (Lord Randolph) did not care a rap.  Yet at\r\nopportune moments he used the Press with skill.  Or, if I ought not\r\nto say used, he availed himself adroitly of the Press to serve his\r\nown purpose.  His midnight journey to _The Times_ office in Printing\r\nHouse Square in order to tell Mr. Buckle that he had resigned from\r\nLord Salisbury's Ministry and that his resignation had been accepted\r\nis a case in point.  It is just conceivable that Mr. Buckle took, or\r\nmight have taken, a more lenient view of Lord Randolph's _coup de\r\ntête_ from having the exclusive news of it.  It is, at any rate,\r\nconceivable that the resigning Minister imagined, or hoped, a\r\nfriendly opinion would be expressed.\r\n\r\nI will give a very different instance which came to my knowledge\r\ndirectly.  At the time of the great dock strike which disordered and\r\nthreatened to destroy all the waterside industries of the port of\r\nLondon, Cardinal Manning sided with the {328} strikers.  He was a\r\nprelate who often mixed politics with his religion or, to put it more\r\ncharitably, with his ecclesiastical polity.  He went to the East End\r\nand made a speech at the strikers' meeting, undeterred by the fact\r\nthat they were threatening violence, and he wound up by giving £25 to\r\nthe cause of these enemies of public order.\r\n\r\nAll this came out in next morning's papers.  Toward noon I went to\r\nsee Lord Randolph.  He was full of the subject and his sympathies\r\nwith the men were evident.  He had read Cardinal Manning's speech\r\nand, with certain reservations, approved of it.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think he ought to have given money to encourage disorder?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by encouraging disorder?  The men are out of work.\r\nThey and their wives are starving.  I would gladly give £25 myself if\r\nI had it.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I suppose no act of Cardinal Manning, nothing he did in\r\nhis extremely variegated career, brought upon him more or better\r\ndeserved censure in the Press than the countenance he gave to this\r\nvery dangerous industrial rebellion.  The censure upon Lord Randolph\r\nwould surely have been not less severe.  But what cared he?  Lord\r\nRandolph, I ought to add, had been during a great part of his too\r\nshort political life the friend and champion of the working men.  He\r\nbelieved them to be the necessary support of the Conservative Party\r\nwithout which, as the event proved, that party could win no great\r\n{329} victory at the polls.  He believed them to be, as a body, like\r\nthe majority of the English people, irrespective of party,\r\nessentially Conservative.  He was ready to do what he could to\r\nlighten and brighten their sometimes dreary lot.  It was not only as\r\na politician that he interested himself in their fortunes.  He had a\r\nman's sympathy with other men less fortunate than himself.\r\n\r\nLess fortunate, but perhaps not always much less.  For what I said\r\nabove about Lord Randolph's indifference to money was true during\r\nnearly all his life, and was shown in many ways to his own hurt.  He\r\nhad the usual younger son's portion, and in this country of\r\nmagnificent estates the younger son's portion is of the most modest\r\ndescription.  Not otherwise than by reserving the great bulk of the\r\nfamily wealth to eldest sons, one after the other, can these\r\nmagnificent estates be kept together and kept magnificent.  But Lord\r\nRandolph's tastes and ambitions were nowise in proportion to the\r\nslenderness of his income.  The present Mr. Winston Churchill in his\r\nmost admirable _Life_ of his father has made some reference to two\r\noccasions in which questions of money became critical.  He has said\r\nso much that I think I may say a little more.\r\n\r\nThe first was in anticipation of his marriage.  Mr. Jerome had the\r\nideas of the average American father about settlements.  Lord\r\nRandolph's ideas on that subject were English.  There was a collision\r\nbetween the two.  The wooer had already announced to his father, the\r\nseventh Duke of {330} Marlborough, his attachment to Miss Jerome and\r\nthe Duke had agreed provisionally to the engagement.  Mr. Jerome had\r\nagreed, but his views about money threatened to break off the\r\nnegotiations.  At the end--they had lasted seven months--Lord\r\nRandolph \"refused utterly to agree to any settlement which contained\r\neven technical provisions to which he objected.\"  He delivered to Mr.\r\nJerome what his biographer rightly calls an ultimatum.  He was \"ready\r\nto earn a living in England or out of it\" without Mr. Jerome's help,\r\nand in this the girl agreed with him.  Mr. Jerome capitulated.\r\nPerhaps the difference between them was more a matter of form than\r\nanything.  The terms of the final agreement are not stated in the\r\n_Life_.  They have often been stated in London where everything on\r\nevery subject of human interest is known, and where it was always\r\nunderstood that Mr. Jerome agreed to settle £2000 a year on his\r\ndaughter and son-in-law, with remainder to the children, duly secured\r\nby a mortage on the University Club house in Madison Square.  But\r\nwhat I ask you to notice is the readiness of Lord Randolph to fling\r\naway an income far larger than he had ever had unless it came to him\r\non such terms as he thought right and unless his English views were\r\naccepted by this American father.\r\n\r\nThe other instance relates to South Africa.  When he went to\r\nMashonaland, in 1891, he borrowed £5000 from a good and staunch\r\nfriend whom I should like to name--well, why should I not?  I mean\r\nLord Rothschild, whose kindnesses {331} to men of every degree and of\r\nall religions and races have been innumerable.  If ever a great\r\nfortune paid, in the long-ago phrase of Mr. Chamberlain, a ransom,\r\nhis has paid it; not compulsory but from true good-will to men.  Lord\r\nRandolph invested the £5000 in Rand gold mining shares on the advice\r\nof that American engineer of genius, Mr. Perkins, who inferred from\r\nthe dip of the gold-bearing reefs the direction and depth at which\r\nthey could be overtaken by shafts sunk far south of the actual gold\r\narea.  The world knows the result and is the richer by hundreds of\r\nmillions for the vision which pierced the outer crest of the earth\r\nand saw the treasures hidden below.  Mr. Perkins was, in fact, the\r\nengineer whom Lord Rothschild had sent to South Africa with Lord\r\nRandolph.  They had gone through Mashonaland together vainly, and the\r\nex-Chancellor of the Exchequer now invested his £5000 in Rand shares.\r\nBut values of that nature require time and being in want of money he\r\nsold two-fifths of his investment.  The remainder he held till his\r\ndeath when it was disposed of for something over £70,000.  A\r\ncomfortable fortune to leave?  Yes, comfortable enough to pay the\r\ndebts of the estate.  That was one form which his contempt for money\r\ntook.  He lived on the principal.  It is no matter of censure.  He\r\nwas born and built that way.  The strain of frugality in the first\r\nDuke of Marlborough had worn itself out.\r\n\r\nMy last meeting with Lord Randolph was at Tring, Lord Rothschild's\r\nplace in Buckinghamshire.  {332} He was already in the grip of the\r\nillness which was to destroy him; nervous, irritable, restless in\r\nmanner, haggard to look at, and his speech uncertain.  I don't like\r\nto think of it and I mention it only for the sake of the contrast.\r\nFor now and again the old brilliancy reappeared, and the old charm.\r\nHe had both in a measure given to few men.  Wilful as he was, with a\r\nfreedom of speech which overpassed the usual social limits, he had\r\nalso when he chose the graces and gifts which made him beloved of men\r\nand of women.  No man made more enemies; but in this world--by which\r\nI mean this world of England and other worlds where the English\r\npeople have built new civilizations--it is not enmities which count\r\nbut friendships.\r\n\r\nWhether you saw him in the House of Commons, leading it as no man had\r\never led it, or at a dinner, or on the platform, or, if you like, on\r\nthe Turf or in other places which the Puritan thinks of the devil, he\r\nhad the same ascendancy.  He said once to Lord Rosebery that to both\r\nof them their titles had been helpful in public life.  No doubt, but\r\nsomething besides a title descends or may descend, to him who bears\r\nit.  Not every son of a duke has upon him the stamp of the patrician.\r\nThat is what Lord Randolph had.  An imperious temper, an intellectual\r\ndisdain of natures from which intellects had been omitted, moods of\r\nblack despair late in life, but all through life the set resolve to\r\nwin his battles without much thought of the cost--all these he had,\r\nand no one {333} of them nor all of them broke or impaired the spell\r\nhe laid upon those about him.\r\n\r\nNarrow means never stinted his generosity.  Uncertain health never\r\nstilled his passion for work.  I never went into his library that I\r\ndid not find him busy.  I have seen him at dinner turn away from the\r\ndistinguished woman who passed for the most amusing of talkers to\r\ndevote himself to a neglected stranger.  When he quarrelled with the\r\nPrince of Wales (King Edward) and went into a kind of social exile\r\nfor seven years, while he was quite aware of the price he was paying,\r\nhe never dreamed of surrender.  When Lord Salisbury, not choosing to\r\nremember or perhaps not able to remember his services and his\r\ncapacities, passed him over in 1891 for the last time, and gave the\r\nleadership of the House of Commons to his nephew, Mr. Balfour, he\r\nwrites to his wife: \"All confirms me in my decision to have done with\r\npolitics and try to make a little money for the boys and for\r\nourselves.\"  On his release from party obligations he sought others,\r\nand his sister, Lady Tweedmouth, between whom and himself there was\r\non both sides a devoted attachment, persuaded him to see something of\r\nmen from whom he had held aloof.  Mr. Gladstone was among these, and\r\nI end with Mr. Gladstone's remark about Lord Randolph:\r\n\r\n\"He was the courtliest man I ever met.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{334}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nLORD GLENESK AND \"THE MORNING POST\"\r\n\r\nThe owning or leasing of several houses is an English habit which is\r\nno longer confined to great landowners who have inherited their\r\npossessions.  Many men whose success in life is their own adopt the\r\ncustom.  Among many instances I will take one, for other reasons than\r\nhouse-owning, the late Lord Glenesk, who had at one time a lease of\r\nInvercauld, the fine place belonging to the Farquharson family.\r\nThere, as later at Glenmuich, he liked to gather friends about him\r\nand there was each year a succession of parties.  In the beginning\r\nMr. Borthwick, he became successively Sir Algernon Borthwick and Lord\r\nGlenesk.  His name and his wife's connect themselves with many social\r\nmemories in Scotland, in London, where the house in Piccadilly was\r\nlong a brilliant centre, and in Cannes where they occupied in winter\r\nthe Chateau St. Michel at the Californie end of the town in beautiful\r\ngrounds touching on the sea.  They had also for some years that\r\nsquare red brick house in Hampstead on the edge of the heath, with a\r\nlittle land and a brick wall about it, and there they entertained of\r\na Sunday during part of the season.  Both had the {335} art of\r\nhospitality and the secret of social life, by which I mean the secret\r\nof translating mere hospitality into happiness for others.\r\n\r\nMr. Borthwick acquired _The Morning Post_ in 1876.  It was then a\r\nthreepenny paper--six cents on each of six days of the week.  No\r\nEnglishman had ever then thought of a Sunday edition of a daily\r\npaper; nor has since.  There are Sunday papers in London, of which\r\none, _The Observer_, is a supremely able journal, but they are\r\npublished one and all on Sundays only.  When _The Morning Post_\r\npassed into the hands of its late proprietor the penny paper had\r\nalready made its appearance, though not the halfpenny.  The future,\r\nit was thought, belonged to the penny, but _The Morning Post_ like\r\n_The Times_ was supposed to appeal to a special class.  It was the\r\norgan of the fashionable world.  You went to it for all that\r\nfashionable intelligence now supplied, more or less completely by all\r\npapers.  It was the one newspaper which lay on the table of every\r\ndrawing-room in Mayfair and Belgravia and in every country house\r\nthroughout the kingdom.  Till Borthwick became editor it was\r\nrespectable, decorous, conventional, and dull.  It had little news\r\nexcept what came to it through Reuter and other news agencies.  There\r\nwere flashes of vivacity when young Borthwick went to Paris, a city\r\nhe understood, and sent home sparkling letters which were the most\r\nreadable things in the paper and always seemed a little out of place.\r\nIt was an organ of Conservatism, but the kind of Conservatism\r\nexpounded {336} in its editorial columns was more orthodox than\r\ninspiring.  It had a moderate circulation and its net yearly profits\r\nwere not far from thirty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Borthwick came into control of this property--not at first,\r\nbut not very long after--he conceived the notion of turning it into a\r\npenny paper.  It was he who told me the story.  He had originality\r\nand he had courage but he was also a man who sought advice in great\r\nenterprises and he talked this scheme over with many men of\r\nexperience far greater than his own.  He said to me later:\r\n\r\n\"One and all they advised me against it.  One and all they thought it\r\nspelled ruin; or, if not ruin, a great risk to a valuable though not\r\ngreat property and the certainty of loss.  They told me I should\r\ninevitably forfeit the support of the classes to whom _The Post_ had\r\nalways appealed and that I should not gain new subscribers from other\r\nclasses in numbers sufficient to make good these losses.  I should\r\nlose not only readers but advertisers, for the advertisers in _The\r\nPost_ were largely the West End tradespeople who desired to reach\r\ntheir West End patrons.  I should lose the political authority which\r\nwas based on the support of the privileged classes.  In short, a\r\npenny _Morning Post_ was inconceivable and unthinkable from any point\r\nof view whatever.\"\r\n\r\nTo all of which Borthwick listened.  He considered every argument and\r\nobjection and protest laid before him.  But he was one of those men\r\nwho {337} regarded the opinions of other men not as authoritative but\r\nas the material for forming his own opinion, and he summed the whole\r\nstory up in a sentence:\r\n\r\n\"Every journalist and every man of business whom I consulted was\r\nopposed to the change and I finally took my decision to make _The\r\nMorning Post_ a penny paper in the face of a unanimous remonstrance\r\nby friends and experts of all kinds.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Borthwick told me this some years had passed since the change\r\nhad been made.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"In the first year the profits of the paper doubled.  In the second\r\nthey reached £20,000.  By the fifth the amount was £30,000.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so it went on until the annual net income of _The Morning Post_\r\nwas £60,000--ten times what it had been at the price of threepence.\r\nIt continued to be the organ of the classes; not, however, refusing\r\nto accept that Tory Democracy of which Lord Randolph Churchill was\r\nthe inventor, upon which Toryism, Conservatism, and Unionism have\r\never since thriven.  Neither Mayfair nor Belgravia nor the country\r\nhouses ever tried to do without it.  The advertisers continued to\r\nadvertise.  It became, moreover, the organ of the better class of\r\nservants; butlers, ladies' maids, footmen, and the multitude of\r\nmenials who sought places in the best houses.\r\n\r\nIn other respects also the paper was revolutionized.  It became a\r\nnewspaper.  The day of the humdrum was over.  It had special news\r\nservices and capable men to conduct them.  {338} Borthwick was a\r\npatient man impatient of dulness.  He gathered about him good\r\njournalists and good writers; not always the same thing.  You now\r\nbegan to read the news and letters and leaders from some other motive\r\nthan a sense of duty.  They were readable.  The hand of the master\r\nleft its mark on every column.\r\n\r\nNor did the demands of journalism exhaust Sir Algernon Borthwick's\r\nenergies.  He went into politics and into Parliament, sitting for a\r\nvast constituency in South Kensington.  Lady Borthwick's help in this\r\npolitical and election business was invaluable.  That very\r\naccomplished lady brought to bear upon the voters of South Kensington\r\na kind of influence to which they had been unaccustomed, a social\r\ninfluence.  Their wives took part in the game, neither having nor\r\ndesiring votes but able to affect the course of events as much as if\r\nthe ballot had been theirs, and more.  Lady Borthwick had 2500 names\r\non her visiting list, and they were more than names.  Each name stood\r\nfor an individual whom Lady Borthwick knew, and whose value she knew.\r\nThe beautiful white drawing-room at No. 139 Piccadilly was in those\r\ndays a little more thronged of an afternoon or evening than it had\r\nbeen, but was never crowded.  Some of the best music in London was to\r\nbe heard there at tea-time.  The dinners were carefully studied.\r\nDances and evening parties had a slightly political flavour but were\r\nnone the less successful.  There is, I suppose, no place where more\r\nthan in London their gentle {339} influences have a more soothing\r\neffect upon an electorate.\r\n\r\nIf any reader reflects on the true nature of the exploit which\r\nBorthwick accomplished he will perhaps agree that the man capable of\r\nit must have had a high order of genius.  If it was not creative in\r\nthe sense that Lord Northcliffe's is creative, it was perfectly\r\nadapted to the circumstances and the time.  It has not perhaps been\r\nquite adequately recognized.  Lord Glenesk was so much a figure in\r\nsociety that when his name was mentioned men who knew only the\r\nsurface of things saw in him the ornament of a ballroom.  He was\r\nthat, and he was so very much more that this ballroom part of his\r\nlife is hardly even incidental.  He would dance night after night.\r\nIn the day-time his mind applied itself to some of the stiffest\r\nproblems of a very difficult profession.  He told me one morning he\r\nhad not been in bed for three nights.  The only answer I could make\r\nwas that I did not know he ever went to bed.  But I knew that after\r\nsleepless nights he spent days of necessary hard work at the office,\r\nand that he brought to each matter he dealt with the freshness of a\r\nfresh mind.  It was late in life before he began to know the meaning\r\nof the word tired.\r\n\r\nTake him for all in all, I should name Lord Glenesk as one of the\r\nthree great men I have known in English journalism.  And whether in\r\nor out of journalism he had a kindliness, a charm, a sweet authority\r\nin the affairs of life which do not belong to all successful men.\r\n\r\n{340}\r\n\r\nBy and by there appeared in Lady Borthwick's drawing-rooms a fresh\r\nflower of a girl whose presence at her mother's afternoon concerts\r\nand then at evening parties was a little in advance of her coming\r\nout.  Miss Lilias Borthwick is now the Countess Bathurst and I\r\nbelieve has, when she chooses to exercise it, full control over _The\r\nMorning Post_; of which Mr. Fabian Ware is the present editor, a\r\nyoung journalist who has made himself a name in his profession.  Lady\r\nBathurst is, like her mother, one of those women who possess better\r\nmeans of making their wishes and character felt than by clamouring\r\nfor votes.  There are cases where womanly charm may be the companion\r\nof settled opinions and convictions and clear purposes, to which _The\r\nMorning Post_ of to-day is a witness.\r\n\r\nOne factor in the success of the paper was Oliver Borthwick, the son\r\nof Lord Glenesk.  Journalism attracted him; he entered his father's\r\noffice early; his aptitudes for the business showed themselves at\r\nonce, and before many years he was managing editor.  He had an\r\ninquiring, inventive mind.  He kept his Conservatism for politics,\r\nand applied to the conduct of _The Morning Post_ the most original\r\nand even radical and sometimes daring methods.  He understood details\r\nand thought no detail beneath the notice of a manager.  He liked to\r\ndo things which the old hands in the office pronounced impossible,\r\namong them that paged index to the contents of the paper which he\r\nfirst believed and then proved to be practicable.  All {341} this did\r\nnot stand in the way of broad conceptions and great schemes for which\r\nhis father gave him a free hand.  Lord Glenesk asked me one day if\r\nOliver had told me of his newest plan.  I said no.  \"Well, you had\r\nbetter ask him about it.  I shall not interfere, though it is going\r\nto cost a lot of money\"; and he named a sum which ran into many\r\nfigures.  Those were the relations which existed between father and\r\nson.  But there came a day when they existed no longer.  Oliver\r\nBorthwick's joy in his work was such that he never spared himself and\r\nhe died at thirty-two, his father still living.  The only gift he\r\nlacked was the gift of adapting his work to his strength.  He\r\noverworked recklessly; he could not do otherwise.  He would spare\r\neverybody but himself.  And so to-day, instead of being an ornament\r\nof his profession and of social life, Oliver Borthwick is only a\r\nmemory and a lasting regret.\r\n\r\nSince the foregoing was written Mr. Reginald Lucas has published his\r\n_Lord Glenesk and The Morning Post_, an agreeable and informing book.\r\nThis is not the place to comment on it but I should like to add to\r\nwhat I have said above of Lord Glenesk a passage from a signed review\r\nby me in _The Morning Post_:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As I think of the man whom I knew, the importance of the things he\r\ndid, great and brilliant as they were, seems to me less than the\r\nimportance of the man himself.  If I could, I should like to describe\r\nnot what he did but what he was.  {342} I should say that his\r\nfriendships, to which I have already referred, were part not only of\r\nhis life but of himself.  The range of them would show that.\r\nPolitical friendships came to him in his position as a matter of\r\ncourse.  But friendships non-political were more numerous and more\r\nremarkable still.  The late Queen's regard for him was a strong one.\r\nEarly in life he was the friend of that astonishing Frenchwoman,\r\nElizabeth Rachel Felix, more commonly known as Rachel, perhaps the\r\ngreatest tragedian of all time, in almost the full flower of her\r\ngenius at seventeen.  Later in life he was the friend, the very\r\nhelpful and trusted friend, of Madame Sarah Bernhardt.  He early\r\nconceived and retained to the end an affection for the French\r\nEmperor.  I need not go on with the catalogue but there are many\r\nfriends, not to be named, who were under obligations to him for\r\nkindnesses and whom he seems to have liked because he had helped\r\nthem.  All through life that was true.  He gave freely, generously,\r\ndelicately.  _Nihil humani_ was his motto or one of his mottoes.\r\nThere must have been many.  A life so varied as his does not move to\r\nthe music of a single air on a single string.\r\n\r\n\"Not the briefest, and not even the most public, notice of Lord\r\nGlenesk can omit all reference to the happiness of his private life.\r\nEven the few lines above may show what part his wife had in his\r\nhappiness, and he in hers.  Of his daughter, Lady Bathurst, Mr. Lucas\r\nhas told us something with due reserve; enough to give his readers at\r\n{343} least a hint of the affection between her and her father and\r\nwhy it was on both sides so deep, and is on hers so abiding.  Oliver\r\nwas to all the world a beloved and brilliant figure, and when the\r\ntime came his father's right hand; then finally relieving him of his\r\nexecutive cares.  Then at thirty-two came the end, and then the\r\nfather at seventy-five takes up the burden once more, but not for\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lucas tells us that President Roosevelt's 'manner of receiving\r\nOliver was particularly flattering.'  I hope it may interest his\r\nfriends if I enlarge that a little.  Oliver told me when he came to\r\nWashington that he had the usual introduction from the British\r\nAmbassador, which is indispensable, and asked me what he had better\r\ndo.  He wished something more than a formal interview as one of the\r\nmany whom it was the President's habit to receive in line, bestowing\r\na few cordial but conventional words on each.  I saw the President\r\nthat afternoon, told him something of Oliver's position and of Oliver\r\nhimself.  He answered, 'Bring him to lunch to-morrow.'  At lunch the\r\nPresident put him next to himself and the two talked together during\r\nand after this meal.  Then Oliver and I walked away.  He said, 'The\r\nPresident is a great natural force,' a phrase which recalls Lord\r\nMorley's later remark that the two greatest natural phenomena he had\r\nseen in the United States were Niagara and President Roosevelt.  The\r\nday following I again saw the President, who perhaps will for once\r\nallow himself to be quoted.  He said: 'Your friend {344} Oliver\r\nBorthwick is a very young man, but a man.'  Then a pause; then, 'And\r\nwhat charm he has.  It is long since I have met any newcomer whom I\r\nhave liked better.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{345}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n  QUEEN VICTORIA AT BALMORAL--KING EDWARD AT\r\n  DUNROBIN--ADMIRAL SIR HEDWORTH LAMBTON--OTHER\r\n  ANECDOTES\r\n\r\nInvercauld, of which Lord Glenesk was long tenant, lies near\r\nBalmoral; a name famous the world over as the Highland home of Queen\r\nVictoria and then of the late King.  A castle on which the very\r\nGerman taste of the very German husband of the great Queen has left\r\nits mark.  It is no more a fine castle than Buckingham Palace is a\r\nfine palace.  It stands, however, in a beautiful country and some of\r\nthe best drives within easy reach are those on the Invercauld\r\nproperty.  They are private but all gates swing open to Kings and\r\nQueens.\r\n\r\nThe privacy was one thing the Queen liked.  So long as she was in the\r\nHighlands the loyalty of her subjects was expected to manifest itself\r\nby ignoring her presence.  If you saw the Sovereign approaching you\r\neffaced yourself.  You slipped behind a tree or looked over the hedge\r\nor retied your shoelaces.  You might do anything except be aware of\r\nthis august lady's presence and recognize it by the usual salute and\r\nthe bared head {346} as she went by.  The Queen was ever, as her son\r\nwas, insistent upon etiquette.  No form of ceremony must be\r\nneglected.  But at Balmoral the etiquette consisted in the absence of\r\nall form or ceremony outdoors.  You were expected to know this, and\r\nif you did not know it but stood at attention with lifted hat this\r\nmark of homage would not be well received.  I once heard a stranger\r\nwho had offended in this way say that the look upon the Queen's face\r\nas she passed was a lesson not to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nHer Majesty drove quietly about in a pony carriage with perhaps the\r\never faithful John Brown in attendance to lay a shawl about her\r\nshoulders or take one off, as he judged best.  You might see him do\r\nas much as that in the publicity of Hyde Park in London.  It was\r\npartly in the simplicity of this Highland life that the Queen found\r\nrepose.  Her Majesty would sometimes stop at Invercauld House for\r\ntea, apparently as one neighbour appealing to the hospitality of\r\nanother.  But I imagine these impulses were announced beforehand and\r\nthat the list of guests at Invercauld was known at Balmoral.  During\r\none week there was among them a lady who, for purely technical\r\nreasons, was never received at Court though she went almost\r\neverywhere else in London and had, and has, a position almost unique.\r\nBut so long as this lady remained at Invercauld House the Queen found\r\nherself too much occupied with business of State to come to tea.\r\n\r\n{347}\r\n\r\nRoyalty knows, or knows about, almost everybody.  The late King was\r\nalways the best informed man in his dominions.  It was rare that he\r\nmet a man or woman whose face and history were not familiar to him.\r\nHe did once at Dunrobin Castle.  This was not many years ago, when\r\nthe King and Queen were circumnavigating this island-part of their\r\nEmpire in the royal yacht.  The yacht anchored for some days in the\r\nbay off the castle.  The King or Queen, or both, came ashore during\r\nthe day and returned to sleep on board.  As the King, the Duke of\r\nSutherland, and Captain Hedworth Lambton, commander of the yacht,\r\nwere walking up from the pier through the gardens to the castle, a\r\nman passed them.  \"Who is that?\" asked the King.  The Duke had to\r\nadmit he could not tell.  \"Oh, sir,\" said Captain Lambton, \"don't you\r\nknow the castle is full of people whom the Duke doesn't know and the\r\nDuchess never sees?\"  The King took this pleasantry as it was meant;\r\naware that there was beneath it just that evanescent adumbration of\r\nfact which made it plausible.\r\n\r\nCaptain Lambton, then the Hon. Hedworth Lambton, brother to the\r\npresent Earl of Durham, is now Admiral the Hon. Sir Hedworth Lambton,\r\nK.C.B., the youngest man of his rank in the service; or was when he\r\nwas made admiral.  Noted for the quaint felicity of his sayings,\r\nsometimes with an edge to them; noted for his service with the Naval\r\nBrigade in South Africa and the relief of Ladysmith; noted as a\r\nskilful seaman who had {348} commanded the cruiser division of the\r\nMediterranean fleet and afterward the China squadron.  The Lambtons\r\nare a family apart, and Sir Hedworth is a man apart, even amid his\r\nown family.  There are few men who give you a stronger impression of\r\nhaving made their own that rule of life which consists in taking\r\nthings as they come.  Struggling through the watercourses of the\r\nveldt with his 4.10 gun, or on the quarter-deck of the royal yacht in\r\nharbour with only duties of ceremony to perform, he is the same man.\r\n\r\nHe came to Dalmeny House for the week-end while the _Victoria and\r\nAlbert_ was lying at Queensferry.  On the Sunday morning he asked\r\nLord Rosebery and his house-party to go with him to the yacht for\r\nmorning service.  We drove through the charming park to the Leuchold\r\nGate and so to Queensferry pier, whence a launch took us on board.\r\nThe yacht has a displacement of something more than five thousand\r\ntons.  Those external lines of beauty which you expect in a yacht had\r\nbeen omitted by the Admiralty designers responsible for this vessel,\r\nbut once on board everything is admirable.  The ship was lying in the\r\nForth, above the bridge, waiting for Queen Alexandra to embark for\r\nCopenhagen.  Nothing could be smarter than the decks and the crew\r\nexcept the officers; all in full uniform.\r\n\r\nIt was August, and though some Americans say the sun never shines on\r\nthese islands, there are moments of exception and this was one.  It\r\nwas burning hot.  Captain Lambton read the service, {349} his\r\nofficers and guests about him, the men in front, all amidships on the\r\nupper deck.  He came to the Lord's Prayer, the sailors all kneeling\r\nand all caps off.  In the very middle of it, without a change of\r\nintonation or accent, he said to his men: \"If anybody feels the sun\r\nthey may put their caps on.\"  I suppose a super-devout churchman\r\nmight have been shocked, but the reader was captain of the ship and\r\nhe had no idea of allowing one of his men to have a touch of\r\nsunstroke.  It appears they were in no danger for not one of them put\r\non his cap.  Nor did any one seem to think his captain's\r\ninterlocutory sentence out of place.  I have seen often enough both\r\nin the navy and in the army that the most rigid disciplinarian may be\r\nof all others the most careful of his men's health and comfort.\r\n\r\nIn these Dreadnought days nothing of the pre-Dreadnought period\r\ncounts.  But I was once on I believe, the first Dreadnought, of a\r\ntype long since antiquated, with a low freeboard forward and the\r\nwhole expanse of the forecastle deck so arranged as to be, with\r\nreference to the rest of the vessel, a lever on which the Atlantic\r\nmight pile itself up.  I asked the captain what might happen in a\r\nheavy head sea.  \"The chances are,\" he answered coolly, \"she would go\r\ndown head foremost.\"  However, at the moment she was comfortably\r\nanchored off Queensferry.\r\n\r\nThat danger exists no longer for the model is obsolete, and this\r\nparticular ship no doubt went long since to the scrap heap.  But the\r\nunsolved {350} problems of naval warfare are still numerous.  A\r\nfighting admiral in the British navy will tell you strange things if\r\nhe happens to be in a talkative mood.  Nothing is better worth\r\nlistening to than the discourse of a man who has command of a great\r\nfleet or of a great ship, whether of war or commerce.  I quote one\r\nsentence:\r\n\r\n\"You want to know what is likely to happen when two modern battle\r\nfleets meet at sea, equal in fighting strength and under equal\r\nconditions.  No man knows.  It has never yet happened.  But the\r\nchances are both would go to the bottom.\"\r\n\r\nOut of many Highland incidents I choose one, for brevity's sake.\r\n\r\nInvermark.  A place renowned for many kinds of sport, salmon fishing\r\nincluded.  It belonged, when I knew it, to the late Lord Dalhousie,\r\nwho generally let it and confined himself to Brechin Castle, with\r\nexcursions to Panmure House.  Invermark was a lodge and nothing more;\r\njust room for half a dozen guests and their guns and servants.  Lord\r\nDudley and the late Lord Hindlip had it together one year.  Lord\r\nHindlip was the head of the great brewery firm of Allsopp & Co.  He\r\nannounced to us one night at dinner that he must go to London next\r\nmorning on business.  He went, returning two days later.  He had\r\nspent twelve hours in London.  Somebody said \"I hope your business\r\nturned out all right.\"  Lord Hindlip answered: \"I don't know about\r\nall right.  I bought £750,000 ($3,750,000) worth of hops a price\r\nwhich makes it impossible there should {351} be any profit in the\r\nnext twelve months' brewing.\"  Nobody asked but everybody looked\r\nanother question: \"Then why buy?\"  Lord Hindlip continued his\r\nsentence as if he had not noticed our curiosity.  \"But if I had not\r\nbought yesterday there would have been no brewing of beer at all for\r\nthe next twelve months, nor perhaps ever.\"\r\n\r\nThis was one of the houses--perhaps only those belonging to the great\r\nbrewers--where beer was served with the cheese instead of port.  But\r\nnot the kind of beer known to the ordinary mortal.  Beer specially\r\nbrewed, long kept, tenderly cared for, and somehow transformed into a\r\ntranscendental fluid, transparent, golden in colour, nectar to the\r\ntaste, strangely mild on the palate, but swiftly finding its way to\r\nthe brain if you were ensnared into drinking a tumblerful.  There was\r\nnothing to warn you unless your host warned you, which he generally\r\ndid not.  He perhaps rather pressed it upon you as they do the Audit\r\nale at Trinity College, Cambridge, with a hospitality not free from\r\nguile.  That I knew through the late Mr. Justice Denham, who was my\r\nhost, and when I resisted he told me how Lord Chancellor Campbell had\r\npraised the mildness of the ale, and had a second drink, and then a\r\nthird; and upon emerging from the buttery into the fresh air found\r\nhimself embarrassed; he, the hardest head at the Bar of his time.  A\r\nstory which I hand on as a warning to the next comer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{352}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nFAMOUS ENGLISHMEN NOT IN POLITICS\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThere are, perhaps, a few names of to-day which it is possible to\r\nmention without becoming involved in the politics of to-day.  The\r\nEnglish, it is true, draw a broader line between what is purely\r\npolitical and what is personal than we do.  They can give and take\r\nhard knocks, whether in Parliament or on the platform or even in the\r\nPress, without animosity or resentment.  But since in America it\r\nseems to be supposed that any reference to these encounters may have\r\nits danger side I avoid them for the present.  I turn away from the\r\nRevolutionary present, of which one's stock of Memories increases day\r\nby day, to the more peaceful past or to a more peaceful world in the\r\npresent; a world unravaged by political passions.  True, the past was\r\nnot always a peaceful past while it lasted.  We do not always\r\nremember how fierce were the storms which have subsided.  But where\r\nDeath has made a solitude we call it peace.\r\n\r\nIn two, at least, of the great contests waged these periods of peace\r\nI had a share, which {353} I must mention again for the sake of\r\nanother story I have to tell.  One was the conflict about Irish Home\r\nRule which became critical and revolutionary in 1881 and 1886; when I\r\nwas allowed to state my own views, unpopular as they were in America,\r\nin _The Tribune_ week by week or day by day; a policy of generous and\r\nfar-sighted courage on the part of that journal; honourable to its\r\neditor and I hope in the long run not injurious to the paper.\r\n\r\nThe second was in 1895 and 1896, in _The Times_ of London.  When\r\nPresident Cleveland flung his message of war upon the floor of the\r\nHouse at Washington in December, 1895, I necessarily had much to say\r\nabout it in _The Times_.  There again I was given a free hand.  It is\r\nsometimes said that the correspondents of this journal frame their\r\nnews dispatches in accordance with orders issued to them from the\r\nhome office.  I can only say, if indeed I may say so much without\r\nviolating obligations of secrecy, that during a service which lasted\r\nten years I never knew of or heard of any such orders.\r\n\r\nComing to England in the summer of 1896 on a holiday, I had some\r\nslight illness and asked a friend whom I should consult.  My own\r\ndoctor was by that time attending patients, I suppose, in another and\r\nbetter world.  My friend said he had lately seen fourteen physicians\r\nabout his son and each of the fourteen had given a different name to\r\nhis son's disease.\r\n\r\n\"Then I went to Dr. Barlow, who said, after a {354} long examination,\r\n'I do not know what is the matter with your son nor what to prescribe\r\nfor him.'  Then I felt I had found a doctor whom I could trust.\"\r\n\r\nSo I went to Dr. Barlow, without an introduction.  At the end of a\r\nrather long consultation and a definite opinion and a settled\r\nprescription, I asked what his fee was.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\nI thought he had misunderstood my question, and repeated it.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing.  I can take no money from a man who has done as much as you\r\nhave to keep the peace between the two countries.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I next saw the manager of _The Times_ I told him of this\r\nincident, which he seemed to think interesting.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"Such evidences of good feeling from a man so distinguished as Barlow\r\nand so far removed from politics do indeed make for good feeling on\r\nboth sides.  I hope you will tell all your own people.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, for I cannot tell it without more or less directly\r\npaying a compliment to myself.  But many years have since ebbed away.\r\nModesty is at best but an inconvenient handmaiden, from whom I would\r\npart company if I could.  Let her keep to her proper place.  An\r\nobligation of honour is peremptory; and this, perhaps, is one.  I did\r\ntell a certain number of friends at the time, and now I repeat the\r\nanecdote to a larger number.  I set it against Mr. Price Collier's\r\nmischievous dictum that English and Americans do not like each {355}\r\nother.  The dictum already seems to belong to a distant and misty and\r\nmythical past.\r\n\r\nSince that year of 1896 Dr. Barlow has become (in 1902) Sir Thomas\r\nBarlow, Bart., and Physician to the King's Household; about as high\r\nas anybody can go in the medical profession.  A Lancashire lad to\r\nbegin, with, he has had a vast hospital experience, and still keeps\r\nup his hospital work; he has a vast private practice; Harvard and two\r\nCanadian universities have given him their LL.D.; he is an F.R.S., a\r\nK.C.V.O., and other parts of the alphabet pay him tribute.  All these\r\nand many other titles and distinctions have their value, though the\r\nlate Sir Henry Drummond Wolff, who had more than most men, did say:\r\n\"They give me every kind of letter to my name except L.S.D.\"  But the\r\nessential thing in Sir Thomas Barlow's case is that he has the\r\nconfidence of the public and of his profession.\r\n\r\nOne thing, it seems to me, the great surgeons and physicians I have\r\nknown had in common.  They were great men, first of all.  They had\r\ngreat qualities outside of their profession.  Two years ago last\r\nSeptember, a time when the big men are mostly away, I wanted a\r\nsurgeon and knew not where to find one.  A chemist finally gave me a\r\nname, Mr. Henry Morris, and an address; name wholly unknown to me,\r\nthough the address, Cavendish Square, implied at least professional\r\nprosperity.  I had had a fall at the Playhouse, as Mr. Maude calls\r\nhis little theatre, the night before, leaving a box by what I\r\nsupposed {356} to be steps and in the absence of steps coming down on\r\nthe floor, bruised, and I knew not what else.  My surgeon made his\r\nexamination.  What struck me was that he wasted never a word nor a\r\ngesture.  The touch of his hands, of his fingers, had a mathematical\r\nor instrumental precision.  So had his questions.  In five minutes or\r\nless he had covered the ground and delivered his opinion.  Anything\r\nmight have happened, but nothing had, bar the bruised muscles.\r\n\"We'll attend to those for you.\"  He asked if I was leaving town and\r\nwhen I said I was sailing for New York on Saturday he remarked:\r\n\r\n\"If you were a working-man I should send you to the hospital and you\r\nwould be kept in bed till you were well.  But if you choose to sail\r\non the _Lusitania_ you must bear the pain.  Now, as you are here, you\r\nmight as well let me overhaul you.\"\r\n\r\nThen, as before, the same precision, the same delicacy of touch, the\r\nsame rapidity, nothing hurried, nothing missed; his examination a\r\nwork of art as well as of science.  Then he began to talk of other\r\nthings; and again, and even stronger, was the impression of being in\r\ncontact with a master mind.  Seldom have I spent a more stimulating\r\nhour.  He was, I found later, Mr. Henry Morris, Consulting Surgeon to\r\nthe Middlesex Hospital and President of the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons.  In other words, Mr. Henry Morris, about whom I ought to\r\nhave known, but did not, was, and is, in the very front rank of his\r\nprofession.  His eminence has since been recognized and {357}\r\nrewarded by the King, and he is now Sir Henry Morris, Bart.  I\r\nsuppose even a Republican may admit that if titles are to be\r\nconferred they are well conferred on men eminent in science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Barlow has since been elected President of the Royal\r\nCollege of Physicians in succession to Sir Douglas Powell.  This is\r\nthe Blue Ribbon of the profession, perhaps a greater honour than a\r\nknighthood or baronetcy, though the knighthood or the baronetcy is\r\nfrom the King, the source and fountain of all such distinctions.  But\r\nthe Presidency of the Royal College of Physicians is conferred by the\r\nProfession itself.  The Fellows of the College, who number some three\r\nhundred, are the choosing body.  They vote by ballot and the man whom\r\nthey elect is the man by whom they wish to be represented before the\r\npublic; the man by whom they are content to be judged.  They say, in\r\neffect, of him whom they choose: \"This is the Head of the Medical\r\nProfession for the time being.\"  The public, which really and rightly\r\nhas much more confidence in the judgment of the doctors upon each\r\nother than in any lay reputation, accepts that.  When you say of a\r\nphysician, \"He is a doctors' doctor,\" you have said about all you can.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Royal College of Physicians has, no doubt,\r\nduties which are not medical.  He has executive, administrative,\r\nconsultative {358} duties; and the very important duty of dining with\r\nthe Lord Mayor, the Corporation of the City of London, and the City\r\nCompanies.  In discharging these latter functions he incurs, I\r\nsuppose, less risk than most men incur.  But risk or no risk these\r\nfeasts have to be faced.  Between all Corporations, Guilds, and\r\nColleges there is a kind of freemasonry.  They have points of\r\ncontact, of sympathy, and are likely to stand by each other in\r\ndifficulties.  Whether dinners were invented as a test and standard\r\nof friendship, I cannot say.  But go to which of them you like, you\r\nwill find a collection of the Heads of other Companies, Colleges,\r\netc.; not all, perhaps, dinner-giving, but all willing victims of\r\nothers' hospitality.\r\n\r\nThe Royal College of Physicians is also a Senate or Parliament; with\r\npowers of legislation and of professional guidance and discipline.\r\nThe Fellows of this College are Trustees for the whole Profession.\r\nThe President has an authority of his own, depending in part on\r\nstatutes and on custom, in part on his personal authority.  In the\r\nlatter Sir Thomas Barlow will not be found wanting.  It is not the\r\nless, it is perhaps the greater, for the genial good nature which\r\naccompanies it.  I said to him once:\r\n\r\n\"Sir Thomas, you have one quality which must be a great drawback to\r\nyour success.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, what is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"When you come into a room your patient at once thinks himself\r\nbetter, and even doubts whether he need have sent for you at all, and\r\nso {359} gets well much quicker than he ought.  It's taking money out\r\nof your pocket.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good.  I'll take care you don't get well too soon.\"\r\n\r\nThere was an electioneering story--oh, no politics in it--the other\r\nday with an equally serious but not more serious, side to it.  Men\r\nwere discussing the system of plural voting still prevailing in this\r\ncountry and certain to prevail so long as votes, or any votes, are\r\nbased on property qualification.  Said a well-known doctor:\r\n\r\n\"I have sixteen votes, all of which I am going to poll.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have two votes of my own and I have fourteen patients who are\r\nof the wrong party and not one of them will be well enough to go out\r\ntill after election.\"\r\n\r\nThink how completely non-political must be a profession of which an\r\neminent member can tell a story like that and run no risk of being\r\nmisunderstood.  The traditions of honour are indeed high among\r\nEnglish doctors, nor could they be in better keeping than now in Sir\r\nThomas Barlow's.\r\n\r\nOne of his predecessors, Sir William Gull, was also not merely\r\nfashionable and popular but recognized by his associates as a\r\nscientific practitioner.  Sir William Jenner was perhaps reckoned by\r\nthe medical profession the best all-round man ever known.  Sir\r\nWilliam Gull was not far off, yet there is an anecdote of him which\r\nsuggests that he put a very high value on the average capacity {360}\r\nof doctors.  He was asked to go a long distance into the country to\r\nsee a patient.  He declined.  He was told that any fee he liked to\r\nname would be gladly paid.  Still he declined, saying there were\r\ncases he could not leave, and when he was pressed further the great\r\nman burst out:\r\n\r\n\"But why do you want me?  There are five hundred doctors in London\r\njust as good as I am.\"\r\n\r\nWhich perhaps was not quite true.\r\n\r\nSir William Broadbent said almost the same thing to me, twenty years\r\nago and more, when I asked him to see Mr. Hay whom I had just left in\r\nhis rooms, in Ryder Street, St. James's, to all appearance extremely\r\nill.  Hay said in his emotional way:\r\n\r\n\"Broadbent is the only doctor I believe in.  If you don't bring\r\nBroadbent bring nobody.  Let me die.\"\r\n\r\nBut Broadbent said no.  He was starting to catch a train for a life\r\nand death consultation in the country.  He must not miss his train.\r\n\r\n\"But there's time enough.  See Hay on your way to the train.  Give\r\nhim five minutes and let somebody else do the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall let somebody else do the whole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hay will see nobody unless he sees you first.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are plenty of men as good as I am.  I will give you half a\r\ndozen names.\"\r\n\r\n\"I want none of them.  I want you.  You know you can stop your\r\ncarriage for five minutes as you drive to the station.\"\r\n\r\n\"My carriage has not come round.\"\r\n\r\n{361}\r\n\r\n\"My hansom is at the door.  Drive with me and let your carriage\r\nfollow.\"\r\n\r\nFinally he did.  When he came out of Hay's bedroom he was a very\r\nangry man.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"Your friend has a bad attack of indigestion.  He will be all right\r\nin an hour.\"\r\n\r\nAnd away he went.  An angry man is not always a just man.  Hay--God\r\nbless his memory--thought himself suffering from a heart attack.\r\nThere is, I believe, a medical analogy between the symptoms of heart\r\ndisease and violent indigestion.  I had left him lying on the floor\r\nalmost in convulsions.  How was he to know it was not heart disease,\r\nto which he believed himself subject?  Hay was not then, to the\r\nEnglish, so great a man as he afterwards became.  He had not been\r\nAmbassador, nor Secretary of State, nor dictated to the European\r\nPowers a new policy in the East.  I ought not to use the word\r\ndictated.  It is not descriptive of Hay's methods, which were\r\npersuasive.  Nor does one Power dictate to another.  Let us say he\r\nhad secured by the adroit use of accepted diplomatic methods the\r\nadhesion of the European Powers to his proposals in respect of China.\r\nNo American Secretary of State had ever made so original or\r\nbeneficent a use of his power.  He had brought his country once for\r\nall into the great world-partnership of great Powers the world over.\r\n\r\nSir William Broadbent did not foresee that.  He could not.  If he had\r\nhe might have been less angry, for he was thought to be considerate\r\nof greatness in all its forms or in many of them.  He {362} liked\r\npatients of distinction, which is no reproach.  He had many of them.\r\nBut the odd thing was that he seemed never quite able to overcome his\r\nawe of rank and title.  In a company of persons of rank his manner\r\nwas not that of an equal.  He used to address persons of rank as a\r\nservant addresses them; or it might be kinder to say as inferiors in\r\nposition used to address their superiors two or three generations\r\nago.  And always with embarrassment.\r\n\r\nAnother celebrated man of medicine, Sir Andrew Clark, had an almost\r\nfactitious renown as Mr. Gladstone's doctor, and Mr. Gladstone was a\r\nvery good patient, in one sense.  One thing this famous physician\r\nhad; he had absolute confidence in himself.  Or, if no doctor has\r\nthat, he had enough to give his patient confidence, which is perhaps\r\nnot less important.  Old Abernethy used to say: \"The second best\r\nremedy is best if the patient thinks it best.\"  And I suppose that is\r\nas true of doctors as of remedies.  If Sir Andrew doubted, he never\r\nallowed you to see that he doubted.  Like all these great men, he had\r\na social as well as medical popularity and he was very good company\r\nat dinner and after.\r\n\r\nOne evening I met him at a pleasant house where there was a good cook\r\nand the company, including the host, did not exceed six; all men.  We\r\nall noticed that Sir Andrew drank champagne.  Presently one of the\r\nmen said:\r\n\r\n\"You don't allow us champagne, Sir Andrew, but you allow it to\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\n{363}\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I have had a long day, and I am very tired, and I must have it.\r\nBesides, when I get home there'll be thirty or forty letters to\r\nanswer.\"\r\n\r\nSo the champagne flowed on, like the water, as Mr. Evarts said, at\r\none of President Hayes's White House dinners.  Sir Andrew drank no\r\nmore than anybody else.  It was only because of his habit of\r\nprohibiting it to others that we noticed whether his glass was full\r\nor empty.  As we went upstairs I said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that after all that champagne you are going to answer\r\nthirty or forty letters when you get home?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, certainly not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what did you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"What I meant was that after my champagne I should not care whether\r\nthey were answered or not.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Sir Andrew Clark who said of Mr. Gladstone, some fifteen years\r\nbefore his death at eighty-eight that there was no physiological\r\nreason why he should not live to be 120.  If that was meant as a\r\nprophecy it had the fate of most prophecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{364}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nLORD ST. HELIER--AMERICAN AND ENGLISH METHODS--MR. BENJAMIN\r\n\r\nIf you care for a clear view of English life and of Englishmen you\r\nneed not always go to the mountain tops in search of it.  If you can\r\nfind a man who stands for what is typical, who is in the front rank,\r\nbut not among the very foremost, who has, in a high degree, the\r\nqualities by which the average Englishman, having them in a much less\r\ndegree, succeeds, he is as well worth studying for this purpose as\r\nthe most illustrious of them all.  I could name many such men.  I\r\nwill take one whom I knew well for many years; to whose kindness I\r\nowed much; whom I saw often in London and stayed with often in the\r\ncountry; for whose memory I have that kind of affection which\r\nsurvives even a sense of many obligations.  I mean Lord St. Helier.\r\n\r\nHe was Mr. Francis Jeune when I first knew him, and when he married\r\nMrs. Stanley.  Later he became Sir Francis Jeune, and finally found\r\nhis way into that House of Lords which it is now the fashion among\r\none set of politicians to decry.  I suppose nobody would deny that,\r\nwhatever {365} be the merits or demerits of the hereditary principle,\r\nthis House contains more distinguished and supremely able men than\r\nany other body that can be named.  For such a man as Francis Jeune it\r\nwas the natural and pre-ordained abode when his honourable career\r\nreached or approached its climax.\r\n\r\nSir Francis Jeune was a man who made the most of his abilities and\r\nopportunities.  He was a good lawyer, a good judge, and, after his\r\nmarriage with Mrs. Stanley, a considerable social force.  It is among\r\nthe peculiarities of English life that the Presidency of the Divorce\r\nCourt should be one of four great prizes at the English Bar.  The\r\nLord High Chancellor, the Lord Chief Justice, and the Master of the\r\nRolls hold the other three most coveted places, and are rewarded by\r\nappointments such as the legal profession in no other country can\r\nhope for.  The dignity of all these positions is very great, and the\r\npay corresponds to the dignity.\r\n\r\nIf we contrast the splendid figures with the salaries of the Judges\r\nof the Supreme Court at the United States, the motto of the Republic\r\nwould seem to be Hamlet's \"Thrift, thrift, Horatio.\"  But if the\r\nlevelling doctrines of the present day were to prevail, the British\r\njudges would soon descend to the money level of the American.  I do\r\nnot imagine they will.  The illiberal treatment of public servants\r\nhas never been popular in England.\r\n\r\nThere is nevertheless something in these high legal posts which\r\nattracts men to whom the pay, high as it is, can be no attraction.\r\nBut that {366} again only sharpens the contrast.  The average income\r\nof the magnates at the American Bar being greater than at the\r\nEnglish, and the salaries of the American judges being less than half\r\nthose of the English judges, why should an American lawyer of the\r\nfirst class ever accept a judicial office?  Clearly there are other\r\nand higher motives than mere money.  There are Americans, we are\r\ntold, who recognize in American life no motive higher than money.\r\nBut are they Americans, or are they of the true American type?  You\r\nmight have asked Mr. Roosevelt when he was here last May.  He is the\r\nmost famous of living Americans and he certainly did not become so by\r\nthe worship of money.\r\n\r\nI have strayed far from Sir Francis Jeune, but the law and the things\r\nof the law must ever have an attraction for any one who has at any\r\ntime, no matter how long ago, been in contact with them; otherwise\r\nthan as a client.  And I will stray further still in order to add\r\nthat one of the greatest names at the English Bar, and now one of the\r\ngreatest memories, is that of an American.  I mean, of course, Mr.\r\nBenjamin.  He had no superior.  It is doubtful whether he had an\r\nequal in those duties of his profession in which he most cared to\r\nexcel.  I knew him a little.  He sometimes talked to me of his\r\ncareer; surely the most remarkable at the English or perhaps any\r\nother Bar, since he was fifty-three when he came to this country.  He\r\nalways acknowledged heartily the kindness shown him, the facilities\r\ngiven him, the aid even of men {367} who foresaw in him a dangerous\r\nrival, to make his path smooth.  I said to him once:\r\n\r\n\"But you came here as the representative of a Lost Cause which the\r\nEnglish had at one time almost made their own.  That may have helped.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; the friendship of the governing classes in England for the\r\nConfederacy had passed into history.  They had discovered their\r\nmistake.  As they would say, they had backed the wrong horse.  It was\r\nstill some years to the Geneva Arbitration but they had begun to be\r\naware they would have to pay, as others do when they put their money\r\non a loser.  However, I don't think that counted one way or the\r\nother.  What did count was the good-will of English lawyers to\r\nanother lawyer.  That you can always depend on.  They shortened the\r\nformalities.  They opened the doors as wide as they could.  And never\r\nonce when I had gained a foothold did I find that anybody remembered\r\nI was not English; or remembered it to my disadvantage.\"\r\n\r\nTaking his place as he did at the very head, he was a memorable\r\nillustration of Daniel Webster's well-known reply to the young lawyer\r\nwho asked him if the profession was not overcrowded:\r\n\r\n\"There is always room at the top.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Benjamin passed swiftly from penury to affluence.  He told me\r\nonce what his highest earnings in any one year had been.  The amount\r\nwas larger by many thousands of pounds than the income of his chief\r\ncompetitor.  It was larger, I think, than any English lawyer now\r\nmakes except {368} at the Parliamentary Bar, where the figures are\r\nalmost fantastic.  This is a money test but apply any other you like\r\nand you would still see the figure of Mr. Benjamin standing out from\r\namong the crowd and high above it; and above even the highest of that\r\nday.\r\n\r\nI dined lately at the Inner Temple as the guest of a great and\r\nsuccessful lawyer.  There was a company of other successful lawyers\r\nand of judges.  I asked a question or two about Benjamin.  In that\r\nperfectly rarefied legal atmosphere there could be none but a purely\r\nlegal opinion.  And there was but one opinion.  Most of these men had\r\nknown him, though Benjamin died in 1884.  Whether they knew him or\r\nnot they knew all about him.  His greatness was admitted.  Eulogies\r\nwere poured out on him.\r\n\r\n\"Did his American nationality hinder him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It neither hindered nor helped.  He was at the English Bar and that\r\nwas enough.\"\r\n\r\nI come back to Sir Francis Jeune.  He was the friend and legal\r\nadviser of Lord Beaconsfield, whose will he drew.  A Conservative, of\r\ncourse.  His practice at the Bar was never of a showy kind.  But if\r\nyou put yourself into his hands you felt sure he would do the right\r\nand wise thing.  His mind was of the sort known as legal.  When he\r\ncame to the Bench it was seen to be judicial also.  I suppose the\r\ngeneral public has never understood why Probate, Divorce, and\r\nAdmiralty should be united in one division of the Supreme Court.  No\r\ntwo subjects could be more unlike {369} than Divorce and Admiralty.\r\nBut a judge is supposed to have taken all legal knowledge to be his\r\nprovince, and to be equally capable of dealing with all the mysteries\r\nof the law in all its relations to all parts of life.  It is true\r\nthat on the Admiralty side assessors are called in.  An assessor is a\r\nkind of expert.  A retired sea-captain, for example, who has never\r\ncommanded anything but a sailing ship, is supposed to be competent to\r\nadvise on the most intricate questions of modern steamship\r\nnavigation.  The result is sometimes astounding, as in the case of\r\nthe _Campania_, condemned by Mr. Justice Gorell Barnes to pay for the\r\nloss of the bark _Embolton_, by collision, solely because she was\r\nsteaming nine knots.  It was proved that this was the safest speed\r\nfor her and for all comers; that she was under better control at nine\r\nknots than at any less speed.  But the court said: \"If people will\r\nbuild ships which are safest at nine knots they must be responsible\r\nfor the consequences.\"\r\n\r\nSir Francis Jeune had no part in the trial of this famous cause and I\r\nam sure had too much sense to agree with the judgment.  Good sense\r\nwas, perhaps, the predominant trait in his character.  He showed it\r\npre-eminently in the Divorce Court.  There he was helped, no doubt,\r\nby his social experiences.  He knew London as few men know it.  He\r\nhad, in such matters, almost feminine instincts.  But he ruled in his\r\ncourt as all strong English judges rule, and as strong American\r\njudges do not.  In America we say of an advocate: \"He tried such and\r\nsuch a case.\"  In England the phrase is {370} never used of the\r\nbarrister.  It is the judge who \"tries\" the cause, as it ought to be.\r\nSir Francis \"tried\" the causes that came before him.  He knew the\r\nlaw.  He mastered facts easily.  He was not easily misled and he had\r\nthe sagacity which led him quickly to right conclusions.  Since his\r\ndeath there have been contrasts on which I will not dwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{371}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nMRS. JEUNE, LADY JEUNE, AND LADY ST. HELIER\r\n\r\nThe interesting people are the exceptional people; not those cast in\r\na mould common to others, not those whose lives run in a groove but\r\nthose who fashion their own lives in obedience to the dictates of a\r\nnature which is their own.  Among the women of London it would be\r\neasy to choose those of higher rank or greater position than Lady St.\r\nHelier, but I choose her because she is Lady St. Helier.\r\n\r\nWhether the marriage of Mrs. Stanley to Mr. Francis Jeune, in 1881,\r\nwas or was not considered a social event of the first importance I\r\ncannot say.  I was not then in London.  But that it became important\r\nin no long time is clear.  It was first as Mrs. Jeune and then as\r\nLady Jeune that the present Lady St. Helier achieved her great\r\ndistinction as a hostess.  She was not content to do what other\r\nladies of position were in the habit of doing.  She struck out a line\r\nfor herself.  I said lately that London was a world in which\r\neverything of the first rank in many differing ranks and professions\r\nmet at times beneath the same roofs.  That was not always true.  It\r\nwas very far from being true.\r\n\r\n{372}\r\n\r\nIf you go back no further than the eighteenth century you find in\r\nEngland a society consisting of perhaps three hundred or four hundred\r\npersons.  If we may judge by the memoirs and memories that have come\r\ndown to us it was a very brilliant society, perhaps more brilliant,\r\nthough less varied, than the society of to-day.  But it was not\r\ncomprehensive, still less was it cosmopolitan.  It was a caste.  The\r\nhereditary principle prevailed.  It was a society into which you had\r\nto take the precaution to be born.  If you were not born into it you\r\nnever found your way in.  There was no effort to keep people outside\r\nof it.  None was required.  The people who were outside did not dream\r\nof forcing themselves in.  There was no reason why this little clique\r\nshould be on the defence.  The Climbers did not then exist, as an\r\naggressive body, or as a force of any kind.  If you read Boswell's\r\nLife, or Walpole's Letters, or the Life of Selwyn, or any political\r\nmemoirs of the time, it is clear that the dividing line between those\r\nwho were in society and those who were not was a broad one, and was\r\nall but impassable.\r\n\r\nIt has long ceased to be, and the steps by which it was worn away can\r\nbe traced.  But if we come at once to the 'eighties of the last\r\ncentury we see a condition of things which, a hundred years before\r\nthat, would have seemed to the social leaders of that day fantastic.\r\nThe revolution had gone far; it had already become an evolution; and,\r\nof course, the end was not yet.  It needed a Mrs. Jeune to carry it\r\non to its full development.  And {373} since the individual is but\r\none expression of those natural forces which are, in such cases, the\r\noperative forces, there is no reason why Nature should not supply the\r\nindividual as she does the other energies needed for the work she has\r\nin hand.  At any rate, she supplied Mrs. Jeune, and London is to-day\r\na different place from the London we should have known had there been\r\nno Mrs. Jeune.\r\n\r\nFor Society, in the mixed form now prevailing, is supposed to be not\r\nonly a compromise between conflicting forces but the result of much\r\ncareful diplomacy.  Lady Jersey was a diplomatist.  Lady Palmerston\r\nwas a diplomatist.  The late King was pre-eminently a diplomatist.\r\nWhether from temperament or calculation I know not, but Mrs. Jeune\r\ncast diplomacy to the winds.  The one gift which stood to her in the\r\nplace of all others was courage.  She brought together at the same\r\ntable, or under the same roof at Arlington Manor, people the most\r\nunlike.  Each one of her guests had some kind of distinction, or some\r\nclaim to social recognition.  They might or might not have anything\r\nin common.\r\n\r\nMrs. George Cornwallis West, whom we still think of as Lady Randolph\r\nChurchill, once gave at her house in Connaught Place, by the Marble\r\nArch, looking out on Hyde Park, what she called a dinner of deadly\r\nenemies.  It was thought a hazardous experiment.  It proved a\r\ncomplete success.  They were all well-bred people.  They all\r\nrecognized their obligations to their hostess as paramount for the\r\ntime being.  They were Lady {374} Randolph's guests.  That was\r\nenough.  As guests they were neither friends nor enemies.  There were\r\nno hostilities.  The talk flowed on smoothly.  When a man found\r\nhimself sent in to dinner with a woman to whom he did not speak, his\r\ntongue was somehow unloosed.  It was a truce.  In some cases ancient\r\nanimosities were softened.  In all they were suspended.  The guests\r\nall knew each other, and as they looked about the table they all saw\r\nthat Lady Randolph had attempted the impossible and had conquered.  A\r\nsocial miracle had been performed.\r\n\r\nWhat Lady Randolph did for that one evening Mrs. Jeune did night\r\nafter night and year after year.  There was not on her part, I\r\npresume, any conscious intention of bringing irreconcilables into\r\ncontact with each other.  What Mrs. Jeune did was simply to take no\r\nnote of the fact that they were irreconcilables.  Her policy, if\r\npolicy it were, had therefore the kind of validity which comes to a\r\nman or to a woman from not appearing to be aware of the obvious.\r\nThat is a great resource in debate, and a great resource in that\r\nlarger debate which broadens into human intercourse.  The average man\r\nis rather apt to do what he sees is expected of him.  As a guest he\r\nhas hardly a choice.  When he enters a front door he puts himself\r\nunder the dominion of his hostess.  If he is a man of the world, his\r\nphilosophy is to take what is offered him.  If he is not, he is\r\nchiefly concerned to do as others do whom he supposes to be more\r\nfamiliar than himself with the manners {375} and customs of Society.\r\nVery rarely therefore does anything like a collision occur and almost\r\nnever so long as the company is of two sexes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jeune may or may not have thought this out, or she may have\r\nacted from those intuitions which in women supply the place of reason\r\nand are, for all social purposes and some others, more useful than\r\nreason.  People who did not like her used to say that all she cared\r\nfor was to get celebrities together.  They professed to think she was\r\na Mrs. Leo Hunter and her collections of guests so many menageries.\r\nIf that had been so they would soon have been dispersed, nor would\r\nMrs. Jeune, or the Lady Jeune of later days, or the present Lady St.\r\nHelier, ever have attained to the rank she did as hostess.  She\r\noffered Society what nobody else offered, novelty, which is the one\r\nthing Society craves beyond all others.  Said a man who went\r\neverywhere:\r\n\r\n\"I go to Lady Jeune's because I never know whom I shall meet, but I\r\nknow there will always be somebody I shall like to meet.\"\r\n\r\nBy the side of which I will set an anecdote not unlike it.  At a\r\ndinner I was next a lady who knew everybody, and there was a man at\r\ntable whom she did not know.  She asked:\r\n\r\n\"Who is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Justice Stephen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why have I never seen him?  He looks a man everybody ought to know.\r\nBut it is a rare pleasure to meet somebody you do not know.\"\r\n\r\nI will give the other side in another anecdote.  {376} A smart party.\r\nA stream of guests coming up a famous staircase.  Two in a balcony\r\nlooking down on the arrivals.\r\n\r\nHe: \"Who is that?\"\r\n\r\nShe: \"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\nHe: \"But you know everybody.\"\r\n\r\nShe: \"Nobody knows everybody.\"\r\n\r\nThere spoke the voice of authority.  Society in London is now so\r\nmultitudinous that even a bowing acquaintance between its less\r\nconspicuous members is not universal.  It was Lady Jeune's mission to\r\nbring together those who stood apart.  She swept into her net many a\r\nforeigner who but for her might have remained a foreigner.  I will\r\nventure to guess that Lady St. Helier's invitation was one of the few\r\nunofficial invitations which Mr. Roosevelt accepted for his brief\r\nstay in London.  They met twenty years ago or more when Mr. Roosevelt\r\nwas in London, and made friends.  He used to make friendly inquiries\r\nabout Mrs. Jeune, as Mrs. Jeune did about him, year by year, and I\r\noften carried friendly messages from each to the other.  She will\r\nsurround him with delightful people, among whom there will be one or\r\ntwo or three he had never heard of; and when he has met them will\r\nwonder he had not known them always.\r\n\r\nLady St. Helier has published a book of Reminiscences which I have\r\nnot yet read.  I am therefore borrowing a little of her courage in\r\ngiving my own account of some matters which she may have dealt with,\r\nand perhaps from a different point of view.  But I must take that\r\nrisk.  I prefer taking {377} it.  If my testimony, or anybody's\r\ntestimony, is to have any value it must be from its independence.\r\n\r\nMrs. Jeune lived for many years in Wimpole Street; then moved to\r\nHarley Street, and then, after Lord St. Helier's death, in 1905, to\r\nPortland Place.  Their place in the country was Arlington Manor, near\r\nNewbury, in Berkshire, the scene of the battle, in 1643, in which\r\nLord Falkland, despairing of peace, says his biographer, threw his\r\nlife away.  There stands a monument on the battlefield erected not\r\nmany years ago with an inscription by the late Lord Carnarvon,\r\nhimself a kind of nineteenth-century Falkland, who threw away his\r\npolitical future in an impossible attempt to come to terms with Mr.\r\nParnell, Lord Carnarvon also despairing of peace.  The inscription is\r\na piece of literature for ever.\r\n\r\nAt Arlington it was Lady Jeune's delight to gather about her some of\r\nthe men and women she really liked, and who really liked her.  The\r\nhouse was not large, and was devoid of all other splendour than such\r\nas the beauty of its position and view and park and gardens gave it.\r\nBut it was the home of comfort and charm.  Now it has passed into\r\nother hands and Lady St. Helier has built herself another house,\r\nknown as Cold Ash.  But the memories of Arlington will never pass.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was in Arlington that Lady Jeune's gifts as hostess were\r\nto be seen at their best.  It is one thing to take charge of a\r\ndinner, another to handle a difficult team from Saturday to Monday,\r\nor often longer.  Freedom of choice is a thing {378} which has to be\r\npaid for.  But to her this was no task.  She had good hands, and a\r\ntouch so delicate that you were guided without knowing you had a bit\r\nin your mouth.  It was a skill which all depended on kindness and\r\nsympathy; and these belonged to her in overflowing measure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{379}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nLORD AND LADY ARTHUR RUSSELL AND THE \"SALON\" IN ENGLAND\r\n\r\nThe recent death of Lady Arthur Russell diminished by one the number\r\nof accomplished women of this generation who were distinguished in\r\nthe last generation also.  And it closed one of the few drawing-rooms\r\nin London which have been _salon_ as well as drawing-room.  I suppose\r\nLady Arthur herself might have said as she looked about her and\r\nlooked back, \"_Tout passe_.\"  The French phrase would have come\r\nnaturally to her tongue, for she was French: daughter of that Vicomte\r\nde Peyronnet who was Minister to Charles X.  Yet one was not often,\r\nat any rate not too often, reminded of her French origin.  So long\r\nago as 1865 Mlle. de Peyronnet married Lord Arthur Russell, brother\r\nof the ninth Duke of Bedford and of the more famous Lord Odo Russell,\r\nafterward the first Lord Ampthill, long British Ambassador at Berlin,\r\nwhere he managed to be on good terms both with Prince Bismarck and\r\nthe present Emperor; a feat of diplomacy almost unique.\r\n\r\nIt is eighteen years since Lord Arthur died.  {380} He was\r\nindisputably of the last or an earlier generation, having little in\r\ncommon with the present.  People thought of Lord and Lady Arthur as\r\none; of itself enough to identify them with earlier times than those\r\nwhen husband and wife are as likely to be met separately as together.\r\nIf there was a distinction it was at the breakfast hour, at\r\nbreakfasts in other houses.  There was no rule which excluded ladies\r\nfrom these breakfasts, but there was a custom which held good in the\r\nmajority of cases.  The host's wife, if he had one, might or might\r\nnot appear.  But the group of men who were in the habit of\r\nbreakfasting at each other's houses included Lord Arthur Russell, Sir\r\nMountstuart Grant-Duff, Lord Reay, Mr. Charles Roundell, Mr. Albert\r\nRutson, sometimes Mr. Herbert Spencer, and many more.  You will\r\nrecognize Sir Mountstuart Grant-Duff's name as that of the most\r\nvoluminous diarist of his time, and when you have read his six or\r\nseven volumes the map of his life is spread out before you; an\r\nhonoured and useful life, a career of real distinction.  Lord Arthur\r\nhad not Sir Mountstuart's ambitions; he was content with his home and\r\nhis kin and his books.\r\n\r\nHis brother, the Duke, had a habit of referring to himself as\r\nHastings Russell.  An alteration at Woburn Abbey was proposed to him.\r\n\"It will not be made in the lifetime of Hastings Russell,\" his\r\nanswer.  He had a sense of humour, which Lloyd-George must think a\r\nrare thing in a duke.  I drove once from Mentmore to Woburn {381}\r\nAbbey with Lady Rosebery and her little girl, Lady Sibyl, then eight\r\nor nine years old, with a gift of humorous perception rare at any age\r\nin her sex.  The child had a balanced mind and a mature view of\r\nthings which might have belonged to eighteen as well as eight.  The\r\nold place interested her and she asked the Duke to show her the\r\nwhole.  He was delighted and took us through room after room, each\r\nstately and each a museum.  Presently we came to a rather bare,\r\nscantily furnished, unhandsome room, and Lady Sibyl asked:\r\n\r\n\"But what is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"This, my dear, is where I earn my living writing cheques for six\r\nhours a day.\"\r\n\r\nAll three brothers, the Duke, Lord Odo, and Lord Arthur, had a quiet\r\nhumour in common.  Lord Odo had, besides humour, wit.  It was he,\r\nwhile Ambassador in Berlin and during a visit of the Shah, when that\r\ngreat potentate practised a less strict abstinence at dinner than his\r\nreligion demanded, who said to a neighbour: \"After all, it's nothing\r\nwonderful.  You must remember the proverb, '_La nuit tous les chat\r\nsont ris_.  And Berlin used to echo with his caustic, good-natured\r\nspeeches.  Nor did Berlin, nor perhaps London, ever forget Prince\r\nBismarck's saying:\r\n\r\n\"I never knew an Englishman who spoke French well whom I would trust\r\nexcept Lord Odo.\"\r\n\r\nAfter which I dare not name two or three others whose French was not\r\nless perfect than that which Prince Bismarck praised.  The Prince was\r\na good judge, as well he might be.  French had {382} become to him\r\nalmost a second mother tongue; as, indeed, it must be to a European\r\ndiplomatist.\r\n\r\nTo the list of men who were to be met in those days at breakfasts the\r\nname of Mr. George Brodrick ought to be added.  He was a scholar, a\r\nwriter, a journalist, and one of those men who never could understand\r\nwhy the world would not come round to his way of thinking and to him.\r\nHe had real abilities, which survived a university education.  He was\r\nborn into a respectable place in the world, of good family, with good\r\nopportunities, but was never a man of the world.  To be of the world\r\nin the true sense of the phrase a man must, I take it, have a fairly\r\naccurate notion of his relation to the world.  That Brodrick had not.\r\nHis ambitions were political, and most of all parliamentary; but they\r\nremained ambitions.  He could not understand how to commend himself\r\nto a constituency; nor would he ever have conformed to the inexorable\r\nstandards of the House of Commons.  He expected the House and its\r\nstandards to conform to him.\r\n\r\nStruggling with a fine courage for the unattainable, Mr. Brodrick\r\nmeantime occupied himself with journalism, and was for many years a\r\nleader-writer on _The Times_.  The story which points his intense\r\nself-concentration as well as any other connects itself with that\r\nperiod.  He was a guest in a house in Scotland, and while there\r\ncontinued composition of those more or less Addisonian and rather\r\nacademic essays which, when printed on the leader page of _The\r\nThunderer_, became {383} leaders, and very good leaders of their\r\nkind.  He saw fit to write them in the drawing-room and in the\r\nmorning when men are commonly supposed to be elsewhere.  There were\r\nladies and they talked.  Presently Mr. Brodrick rose, marched over to\r\nhis hostess and said to her: \"Lady X., I really must ask you to ask\r\nthese ladies not to carry on their conversation in this room.  I am\r\nengaged upon a most important article and my thoughts are distracted\r\nby talk which has no importance at all.\"\r\n\r\nHis appearance and dress were those of a man who gave no thought to\r\neither.  He was rather tall, angular, uncouth, a stoop in the\r\nshoulders, and his figure consisted of K's.  He had the projecting\r\nteeth which French caricaturists used to give to English \"meesses,\"\r\nin whom it is extremely rare.  Some person of genius untempered with\r\nmercy called him \"Curius Dentatus\"; and the nickname lasted as long\r\nas Brodrick lasted.  With his teeth, and his knees and elbows sawing\r\nthe air, and his umbrella, and his horse all ribs, he was the delight\r\nof the Row.  Everybody liked him but everybody laughed at him.  In\r\nthe end he renounced journalism and renounced politics and became\r\nWarden of Merton.  It was thought he would not be a good Head of a\r\nCollege nor get on with his students, but he falsified all\r\npredictions, governed wisely and well, won the affection of the boys\r\nunder him, and died lamented.  I suppose the explanation is that he\r\nhad at bottom a genuine sincerity of nature.\r\n\r\n{384}\r\n\r\nBut I am wandering far and I return to Lady Arthur and her house and\r\nher guests.\r\n\r\nThe form of _salon_ which Lady Arthur Russell preferred was a _salon_\r\npreceded by a dinner.  It was never a large dinner.  Except in a few\r\nhouses, the banquets of forty or fifty people or more so dear to the\r\nNew York hostess are not given in London, nor is mere bigness\r\nreckoned an element of social success.  In the biggest capital of the\r\nworld, where society far exceeds in numbers the society of any other\r\ncapital, people are content with moderation.  A dinner of forty\r\npeople is a lottery in which each guest has two chances and no more.\r\nHis luck and his hopes of being amused or interested depend wholly on\r\nhis right- and left-hand neighbours.\r\n\r\nLady Arthur, being by birth a Frenchwoman, had French ideas on this\r\nand other subjects.  She did not choose her guests alphabetically,\r\nnor by rank, nor for the sake of a passing notoriety.  Lions you\r\nmight meet at her house but they were not expected to roar; nor did\r\nthey.  Neither at dinner nor after dinner were more people asked than\r\ncould be managed.  Large parties are, of course, given in London but\r\nthey do not constitute a _salon_.  It is of the essence of a _salon_\r\nthat people shall not be left wholly to themselves, as in a large\r\nparty they must be, but shall be looked after.  Affinities do not\r\nalways find themselves.  They have to be brought together.  Others\r\nhave to be kept apart.  No authority is needed.  Intuitions, a quick\r\neye for situations, and a gentle skill in {385} distribution are the\r\ngifts which go to the making of a good hostess.  These Lady Arthur\r\nhad.  By mere smartness she set little store.  I suppose the house in\r\nAudley Square which Lord Arthur Russell built never passed for a\r\nparticularly smart house.  Of houses which are called and which are\r\n\"smart\" there are scores in London.  Of _salons_ there are very few.\r\nHerself the daughter of a French viscount, and with her husband\r\nbrother to a duke, Lady Arthur had no particular need to concern\r\nherself about mere smartness.  That is a reputation not altogether\r\ndifficult to acquire.  The King's smile may confer it.  Not, perhaps,\r\nthe late Queen's of whom one more than usually brilliant butterfly\r\nremarked:\r\n\r\n\"But the Queen, you know, never was in society.\"\r\n\r\nWhich perhaps, in the sense intended, was true.\r\n\r\nIf there were one note more marked than another in these Audley\r\nSquare assemblies it was a note of culture.  Ease and good breeding\r\nand distinction may all be taken for granted.  It is of the things\r\nwhich may not be taken for granted that I speak; and culture\r\ncertainly may not.  There are many houses in London in which it is\r\nneither expected nor desired.  In New York, as we all know, it is\r\ndiscouraged.  It would be discouraged anywhere if it were obtrusive\r\nor pedantic.  Neither in a _salon_ nor anywhere else is it to\r\nsupersede good manners, but to blend with them.  To make a _salon_\r\npossible there must be varied interests, play of mind, flexibility,\r\nadaptability, and an unlimited supply of {386} tact.  Perhaps the\r\nlast includes all social gifts except those of the intellect.  It\r\ncovers a multitude of deficiencies.  Nay, there was Miss Ada Reeve, a\r\nclever actress who last year was discussing on the stage questions of\r\ncostume (elsewhere than on the stage), and announced:\r\n\r\n\"If a woman has tact and diamonds she needs nothing else.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the generalities which you have been reading are really\r\nparticulars and are descriptive of Lady Arthur Russell's receptions,\r\nof which I have spoken as a _salon_.  I don't know that Lady Arthur\r\nherself ever used the word, nor does it matter.  The thing, not the\r\nname, is what matters.  There was culture, of a very unusual kind, on\r\nboth sides of the house.  There was, on Lady Arthur's side, her\r\nFrench blood.  A _salon_ in Paris is no rare thing, and the reason\r\nwhy it is not rare is because the society of Paris is French.  In the\r\nFaubourg St. Germain, if nowhere else, the social traditions of the\r\nold monarchy in its most brilliant days still survive.\r\n\r\nOne of the noticeable things about this house in Audley Square was\r\nthe presence of distinguished foreigners, and another was that they\r\nseemed no longer to consider themselves foreigners.  They were at\r\nhome.  Nor was this true only of men and women of rank who might be\r\nof kin to the Peyronnets, and at any rate were of their world, but of\r\nartists and men of letters.  I will take M. Renan as an example.  He\r\nhad come to London to deliver the Hibbert lectures and a lecture on\r\nMarcus Aurelius {387} before the Royal Institution in Albemarle\r\nStreet, of which the ever lamented Tyndall was then at the head.  I\r\nhad met Renan twice at other houses.  He seemed a little _dépaysé_.\r\nIn Audley Square this exotic and troubled air had disappeared.  He\r\nhad no English--at any rate, he spoke none--and his conversation, or\r\nthe conversation of the English with him, was therefore limited.  But\r\nwhen he talked, and often when he did not, he was surrounded by a\r\ncrowd of listeners or, as the case might be, of lookers-on.  Hence it\r\nwas that he was so often kept, or left, standing, and his physical\r\nframe was of such a kind that long standing was irksome to him, and\r\neven painful.  I noticed one night that he seemed ill at ease, and\r\nsaid to him I hoped he was not suffering.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"that is exactly it; I am _souffrant_, and if I have\r\nto stand much longer I don't know what will happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why don't you sit down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, do you think I might?\"\r\n\r\nSo I took him to a comfortable sofa and, once seated, an ineffable\r\nsweet peace stole over his features.\r\n\r\nA more tragic incident happened in Count von Arnim's case, the end of\r\nwhose career was all tragedy.  At this time he was still German\r\nAmbassador in Paris, but Prince Bismarck had become distrustful of\r\nhim and the end was not far off.  The public, however, knew nothing;\r\nleast of all the English public, whose acquaintance with occurrences\r\non the Continent is apt to be remote.  For {388} aught that was known\r\nin London, Count von Arnim was still the trusted representative of\r\nGermany.  He bore a great name, he held a great position.  The\r\npersonal impression was a little disappointing.  He did not look like\r\nthe man to stand up to Prince Bismarck, who was a giant in stature as\r\nwell as in character; nor was he.  Slight, rather short, lacking in\r\ndistinction, meagre in face, with no hint of power in the shape of\r\nhis head or in his rather furtive expression, or in his carriage, he\r\nseemed, on the whole, insignificant.  The eyes had no fire in them;\r\nhe looked older than his years, and unequal to his renown.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom in those distant days to serve tea in the\r\ndrawing-room after dinner.  Count von Arnim was asked if he would\r\ntake tea, left the lady by whom he was sitting, crossed the floor to\r\nthe tea-table, took his cup of tea from Lady Arthur's hand, and\r\nstarted on his return.  The floor was of polished oak, with here and\r\nthere a rug; just the sort of floor to which he must have been used\r\nto all his life.  But he slipped, his feet flew from under him, and\r\ndown came the Ambassador on his back.  It was an awful moment.  Men\r\nwent to his rescue, he was helped up, evidently much shaken, and\r\nslowly found his way back to the sofa and to the lady who had been\r\nhis companion.  There were almost tears in his eyes.  When, a little\r\nlater, the news of his disgrace became known, a man said: \"Well, if\r\nhe could not keep his feet in a drawing-room, what chance had he\r\nagainst Prince Bismarck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{389}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY--QUEEN ALEXANDRA\r\n\r\nWhen the Radical rages against the House of Lords he commonly selects\r\nas the most deserving object of his wrath the Lords Spiritual.\r\nWicked as the Lords Temporal are, their episcopal comrades are more\r\nwicked still.  This is, or was, more peculiarly the Nonconformist\r\npoint of view.  A Dissenter exists in order to hate a Bishop.  He\r\nhates him as a rival in religion; a successful rival.  He hates him\r\nas the visible sign of that social ascendancy of the Church which is\r\nto the Dissenter not less odious than its political and\r\necclesiastical primacy.\r\n\r\nHe hates him also because he is rich, or is supposed to be so.  The\r\nArchbishop of Canterbury's £15,000 a year, his Palace at Lambeth, and\r\nhis Old Palace at Canterbury are all alike to the true Dissenter so\r\nmany proofs of the Devil's handiwork.  The Archbishop of York is a\r\nsinner of less degree only because his Devil's pension is less by\r\n£5000 a year.  The Bishop of London has the same salary as the\r\nArchbishop of York, and his iniquity, though he is only a Bishop, is\r\ntherefore {390} the same.  There is, then, a descending scale of\r\nfinancial depravity.  Beginning, next after London, with the Bishop\r\nof Durham at £7000, we come to the Bishop of Ely with £5500, the\r\nBishops of Oxford, of Bath and Wells, and of Salisbury with £5000\r\neach, and so, by easy stages of lessening vice, to the pauper Bishop\r\nof Sodor and Man who gets but a pittance of £1500 a year.\r\n\r\nOur Dissenting friend waxes hotter as he reflects that one Archbishop\r\nis paid three times as much as a Prime Minister, and the other twice\r\nas much, while three or four more Bishops receive stipends larger\r\nthan the present colleague of Mr. Lloyd-George and Mr. Winston\r\nChurchill.  These episcopal salaries are even higher than is that of\r\nMr. Lloyd-George, or that of Mr. Winston Churchill, who has to\r\ncontent himself with £5000 a year while discharging not a few of the\r\nduties of the Prime Minister, on the platform and, if all reports be\r\ntrue, in the Cabinet itself.\r\n\r\nThis, perhaps, is rather incidental.  I was explaining why the\r\nDissenter hates the Bishop.  The attitude of the Bishops to the vital\r\nquestion of Education augments the animosity of the Dissenter.  Their\r\nconservatism in general politics inflames their opponents still\r\nfurther.  To the Nonconformist orator they are an unfailing target,\r\nand he ought to be very much obliged to them for supplying him with\r\nammunition, but is not.  Mr. Bright thundered against them and their\r\n\"adulterous origin.\"  Mr. Bright's wrath, whether rightly directed or\r\n{391} not, was in itself a noble thing; the passion of a great soul\r\ngreatly stirred.\r\n\r\nJust at present the Bishops are a little less obnoxious to the\r\nRadical than usual, because they followed the Radical lead on the\r\nLicensing Bill.  That Bill evoked animosities not less bitter than\r\nthe Education Bill.  The Bishops made it a question of temperance,\r\nholding that by higher licensing fees and heavier taxes on\r\npublic-houses and on liquor the consumption of spirits would be\r\nlessened.  They argued that if there were fewer public-houses there\r\nwould be fewer drinkers and drunkards.  They applauded Mr. Asquith\r\nwhen he proposed that on Sundays a man should walk six miles before\r\nhe could have a glass of beer; for that is what the _bona fide_\r\ntraveller clause came to.  If they had the influence with their\r\nfellow-Peers they are supposed to have they could have prevented the\r\nrejection of the Licensing Bill.  But they could not do that.  Then\r\nthe Radicals turned on them because they could not control a House\r\nwhere their very presence is to the Radical a continuing offence.\r\n\"The Brewers are stronger than the Bishops!\" cried the Radical, to\r\nwhose happiness a victim of one kind or another is essential.\r\n\r\nThe Archbishop of Canterbury led his brethren of the Episcopal Bench\r\nin this matter of Temperance, as he has led them on other matters.\r\nHe is their natural leader.  He is the Primate of all England; the\r\nHead of the Church, next after the King.  His abilities and character\r\nare of a kind to fit him for leadership.  I suppose it may sound\r\n{392} like a paradox if I suggest that for him who holds the highest\r\necclesiastical post in the land the first requisite is that he should\r\nbe a man of the world.  But it is true, and it is equally true of all\r\nBishops.  It was true of the late Bishop Potter, who was not only the\r\nmost eminent dignitary of the American Episcopal Church, but almost\r\nthe first citizen of New York.  The Bishops have to administer each\r\nhis own diocese, and a diocese is a province.  They must understand\r\nhow to govern.  They must understand men and, so far as possible,\r\nwomen.  They must be men of affairs.  Whether they know much Greek or\r\nHebrew is of quite secondary importance.  Knowledge of that kind is\r\nornamental; the other kind is essential.  They ought to be\r\ndiplomatists also; skilled not so much in controversy as in avoiding\r\ncontroversy.\r\n\r\nThe present Archbishop is all this.  His public career proves it, and\r\nif you come to know him he will leave a very distinct personal\r\nimpression on your mind.  It was my fortune to meet him at Dalmeny\r\nHouse not many years ago, while he was still Bishop of Winchester.\r\nHis visit lasted some days, and there have not been many days more\r\ninteresting.  Except for his clothes, and perhaps for a certain\r\nsweetness of manner, you need not have supposed him to be a Bishop.\r\nHe did not talk shop.  He talked as others talk who are not of the\r\nChurch.  At once you saw he was broad-minded.  I do not use the word\r\nbroad in its ecclesiastical sense.  There was not a suggestion of the\r\napostolic or missionary attitude.  That {393} was for another place\r\nand other circumstances.  _Nihil humani_ might have been his motto,\r\nif he had a motto.  He talked well, clearly, picturesquely, and in\r\nthe tone which any guest in a country house might use.  He did not\r\nrequire you to remember that he was a Bishop, or even a priest.  He\r\nwas just himself.  His knowledge and good sense and felicity of\r\nthought and speech were his own.\r\n\r\nQueen Alexandra came to tea.  The Archbishop, as the Rev. Randall\r\nDavidson, had been for eight years Dean of Windsor, and naturally had\r\nseen much of the Royal Family.  I suppose I may say that he had in\r\ntime become a trusted friend of the Queen, perhaps her most trusted\r\nadviser.  People who opposed his promotion called him a courtier, as\r\nany man who lives much in the atmosphere of courts may be.  It was\r\neasy to see from the Queen's manner how much she liked the Bishop and\r\nlooked to him for counsel.  If a point were in question, it was to\r\nhim she turned.  The Princess Victoria was with the Queen, and there\r\ntoo was a friendship.\r\n\r\nThose were days when affairs in the United States were in a critical\r\nstate, or seemed to be, and when we were beginning to think that the\r\ngood-will of other countries might be important to us; as it was, and\r\nalways will be, as ours is to them.  So I hope I shall not do amiss\r\nif I repeat now a word which the Queen then said to me:\r\n\r\n\"I hope all the news from your own country is good.  We all hope\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n{394}\r\n\r\nThat expressed the Queen's personal, womanly sympathy, and something\r\nmore.  Far gone were the days when English sympathies were for our\r\nenemies.  They are now for us, and Queen Victoria was our friend and\r\nQueen Alexandra and the late King were our friends.  They shared the\r\nfriendship of their people.  The Queen spoke for herself and for\r\nthem.  The Bishop stood by Her Majesty's side as she said it.  His\r\nface brightened.  He knew, as well as anybody, how much it meant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{395}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nA SCOTTISH LEGEND\r\n\r\nAmong the recollections of Scotland which come thronging on from\r\nother days, the supernatural always plays a part.  I admit they are\r\nnot easy to deal with.  If you believe in ghosts or in legends, a\r\ngreat majority of your readers do not believe in you.  If you are a\r\nsceptic, the credulous pass you by with an air of pained superiority.\r\nIf you neither believe nor disbelieve, you are set down as an\r\nagnostic; and there are great numbers of excellent people to whom the\r\nword agnostic implies reproach.  An agnostic, however, is not one who\r\nbelieves or disbelieves, but who, whatever his private conviction may\r\nbe, declines either to affirm or deny the truth of the matter in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nBut, although an unbeliever, I know of one story connecting itself\r\nwith a famous legend, which is, so far as it goes, absolutely true,\r\nand this I am going to tell exactly as it happened.\r\n\r\nIn 1883 I was staying at Brechin Castle with Lord and Lady Dalhousie,\r\nand Lady Dalhousie proposed one morning that we should drive over to\r\nCortachy Castle to lunch.  Brechin Castle and Cortachy Castle are\r\nboth in Forfarshire and {396} fourteen miles apart.  At that time\r\nCortachy Castle was let to the late Earl of Dudley; the seventh Earl\r\nof Airlie to whom it belonged having lately died.  There's a tragic\r\natmosphere for the eighth Earl was killed at Diamond Hill in South\r\nAfrica in 1900; one of the many men of rank and position and fortune\r\nand everything to live for who, in the early disastrous days of the\r\nBoer War, gave up everything to fight for the flag and for their\r\ncountry and sovereign.\r\n\r\nThe family name is Ogilvy, and the family name and title are both\r\nold, going back to at least 1491.  They were Ambassadors and great\r\nofficers of State, and the seventh Lord Ogilvy was made an Earl.  Two\r\nacts of attainder are testimony to the active part they took in those\r\ntroubled times, and to their capacity for holding fast to the losing\r\nside.  They were in the Earl of Mar's rebellion in 1715, and fought\r\nfor the Pretender at Culloden.\r\n\r\nBesides all that, the Ogilvys carried on for generations a feud with\r\nthe Campbells.  On both sides there were burnings and harryings and\r\nmuch shedding of blood.  There's no need to ask which of them was the\r\nmore in fault.  The standards of those days were not as the standards\r\nof ours; and there was a good deal less of that homage which vice now\r\npays to virtue.  So it happened that one day early in the seventeenth\r\ncentury the Ogilvys found themselves besieged in Cortachy Castle by\r\nthe then Earl of Argyll or his lieutenant.  The besiegers sent in a\r\nherald with a drummer-boy to demand the surrender of the castle.  The\r\n{397} Ogilvy people took the drummer-boy and hanged him over the\r\nbattlements, his mother looking from the camp outside.  As the\r\nfashion was in those days, she launched a curse, or more than one, at\r\nthe Ogilvys, and a prophecy.  She foretold that whenever, through all\r\nthe ages to come, death or disaster should visit them they would\r\nfirst hear the beating of the drum by the drummer-boy.\r\n\r\nSuch is the story as it was told to me.  It is a well-known\r\ntradition, and you are told also that her prophecy has been strictly\r\nfulfilled.  The beating of the drum by the drummer-boy has been heard\r\nat least once in each generation during the centuries that ever since\r\nthen have witnessed the varying fortunes of this family.  That is a\r\nmatter as to which I neither affirm nor deny.  How could I?  I was\r\nnot there.  But the narrative is a necessary preface to the account\r\nof the day when the events I set out to describe did actually occur.\r\n\r\nAt luncheon Lady Dudley, known then and still as the beautiful Lady\r\nDudley, told us that when Lord Hardwicke, one of the guests staying\r\nwith them, came down to breakfast that morning he asked her whether\r\nthe drummer-boy legend applied to the tenants of the castle for the\r\ntime being or only to the Ogilvys.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, only to the Ogilvys, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you won't mind my telling you that I heard the drummer-boy\r\nbeating his drum last night.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Lady Dudley added:\r\n\r\n\"I did not mind in the least.  Whether I believe {398} in the menace\r\nor not, I never heard that it had anything to do with anybody but the\r\nOgilvys.  If it could effect anybody in this case it would be Lord\r\nHardwicke, who heard it, and not us who did not hear it.\"\r\n\r\nWith which we naturally agreed.  We finished our lunch peacefully and\r\npleasantly, and at three o'clock Lady Dalhousie and I drove back to\r\nBrechin Castle, where there were in all twelve guests.  We dined as\r\nusual at a quarter past eight, and shortly before ten the ladies left\r\nthe dining-room.  Just after ten the door opened again.  Lady\r\nDalhousie sailed in, her face brilliant with excitement, but her\r\nmanner serene as usual, and said to her husband:\r\n\r\n\"Dalhousie, Cortachy Castle is burnt to the ground; the Dudleys are\r\nhere and you must come at once.\"\r\n\r\nAt the drawing-room door stood Lady Dudley, pale and beautiful, and\r\nwarned us that her husband knew as yet nothing of what had happened,\r\nand asked us to be careful to say nothing which should alarm him.  He\r\nwas at that time very ill, and his mind was affected.  The rest of\r\nthe evening after we went into the drawing-room passed without any\r\nmention of the disaster to Cortachy.  Lord Dudley sat down to his\r\nrubber of whist, won it, and went to bed not knowing that the house\r\nin which he had expected to sleep had been destroyed by fire.  When\r\nhe was told next morning he said, \"Very well,\"  and turned again to\r\nhis newspaper.\r\n\r\nThe explanation was this: After Lady Dalhousie {399} and I left\r\nCortachy Lady Dudley took her husband for a drive, as usual.  As they\r\nwere returning, late, they were stopped by a messenger who handed\r\nLady Dudley a note from the factor, saying the castle was on fire and\r\nthere was no hope of saving it.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked Lord Dudley.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, nothing much,\" answered his wife.  \"The kitchen chimney has been\r\non fire and the place is in a mess.  I think we had better drive over\r\nto Brechin and ask the Dalhousies to give us dinner.\"\r\n\r\nThis ready wit carried the day and saved Lord Dudley the shock which\r\nhis wife dreaded.  But the whole company of guests at Cortachy were\r\nalso left homeless, and they also came to Brechin and slept there.  I\r\nnever quite understood how, for Brechin Castle can put up, in a\r\nnormal way, fourteen people, and we slept that night fifty-six.  But\r\nLady Dalhousie besides being a reigning beauty, had practical talents\r\nand managed it all as if an inundation of unexpected guests were an\r\neveryday affair.\r\n\r\nThere is one thing to be added.  Past Cortachy Castle flows a shallow\r\nstream with a stony bed.  It was early in September.  The water was\r\nvery low, and what there was rippled and broke over the stones with a\r\nnoise which, at night and amid uncertain slumbers, might easily be\r\nmistaken for the beating of a drum by a man whose mind was full of\r\nthe drummer-boy story.  After I had heard about Lord Hardwicke at\r\nluncheon I had walked along the banks of this burn, and the faint\r\nlikeness {400} of the waters beating on the stones to the beating of\r\na drum occurred to me.  Perhaps a mere fancy on my part.  I don't\r\npress it.  If anybody prefers to believe in the legend I don't ask\r\nhim to believe in my conjecture.  By all means let him nourish his\r\nown faith in his own way.\r\n\r\nHe may like to know, moreover, that Lord Hardwicke, now dead, was one\r\nof the last persons in the world to conceive or cherish an illusion.\r\nA well-known man of the world; in his way a celebrity, if only known\r\nfor his hats, which were the glossiest ever seen outside of the stock\r\nExchange.  He had gone the pace; \"climbed outside of every stick of\r\nproperty he possessed,\" said one of his friends, and had acquired a\r\nvast and varied stock of experience in the process.  On the face of\r\nit, not at all the kind of man to believe too much; nor to believe in\r\nanything, as was said of Mr. Lowe, which he could not bite.\r\n\r\nHe came into the dining-room that night at Brechin and stayed on the\r\nnext day.  Among Lady Dalhousie's guests was Mr. Huxley.  Certainly a\r\nman of the world was Mr. Huxley, but of a different world from Lord\r\nHardwicke's.  They had never met.  You might have said they had not a\r\nsubject in common.  But they talked to each other, and to the\r\nsurprise of the company it presently became evident that they got on\r\ntogether.  I said as much to Mr. Huxley afterward.  He answered in\r\nhis decisive way:\r\n\r\n\"Don't make any mistake.  Lord Hardwicke has powers of mind for which\r\neven his own set, so {401} far as I know, has never given him credit.\r\nWe did not talk about the weather.  He was a man who would put his\r\nmind to yours no matter what you talked about, and it would take you\r\nall your time to keep up with him.\"\r\n\r\nYears afterward I reminded Mr. Huxley of this, and asked him had he\r\never met Lord Hardwicke again.\r\n\r\n\"No, never; and I regret it.  But we did not move quite in the same\r\norbits.  I have hardly seen anybody since who made such an impression\r\non me.  It's not a question of orbits, it's a question of men.\"\r\n\r\nI asked Lord Hardwicke about the same time whether he remembered\r\nmeeting Mr. Huxley.\r\n\r\n\"Remember?  How many Huxleys are there in the world that you should\r\nsuppose I could forget this one?\"\r\n\r\nIt is one of the distinctions of English life in general, and of\r\nLondon, to which New York will perhaps some day attain, that sooner\r\nor later it brings together men and women, each of the first rank in\r\nhis or her own department and each unlike the other.  They have long\r\nunderstood here that a society which is not various ends in monotony;\r\nand of all forms of dulness that is the dullest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{402}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nA PERSONAL REMINISCENCE OF THE LATE EMPEROR FREDERICK\r\n\r\nIt used to be said that English sympathies were given to Austria and\r\nnot to Prussia in the war of 1866 because the Austrian railway\r\nofficials were so much more polite than the Prussian.  Of the fact\r\nthat the English wished Austria and not Prussia to win there is no\r\ndoubt.  The railway reason was perhaps a reason, if not the reason.\r\nThe organization of Prussia was at that time, as the organization of\r\nGermany, civil and military, now is, the finest in the world.  But\r\nflexibility is not one of its merits; still less is it distinguished\r\nby consideration for the rights of the non-military and non-official\r\nGerman world.  The English were then, as now, a travelling people;\r\nand their authority, if I may use such a word, on the Continent was\r\ngreater, or seemed greater, then than now, because the competition\r\nwas less.  Americans had not then begun to swarm across the Atlantic\r\nas tourists, nor was the American language heard on every hill-side\r\nof the Tyrol and on the battlefields of Silesia.  It was all English,\r\nand the English beyond question found Austria a more agreeable\r\npleasure-ground {403} than the wind-swept plateaus of her grim\r\nneighbour to the north.\r\n\r\nIn those days and for many years to come the English had taken and\r\nkept possession of Homburg, the pretty watering-place near Frankfort.\r\nAs in so many other matters, the fashion was set by the late King,\r\nthen Prince of Wales, whom his fellow-subjects, and presently not a\r\nfew Americans, followed in a loyal spirit.  They followed him not\r\nless loyally when he forsook Homburg and journeyed further afield to\r\nMarienbad.  For the truth is the Germans, and especially the North\r\nGermans, had rediscovered Homburg, and the streets where for so many\r\nyears the English accent had been heard, and almost no other, grew\r\nsuddenly hoarse with Teutonic gutturals.  I don't say that this\r\ninvasion drove him elsewhere.  He was himself as much German as\r\nEnglish.  But when his yearly visits in August ceased the English\r\nsurrendered Homburg to its real owners, albeit they rather resented\r\nwhat they called their usurpation.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, one English woman who clung to it, the Empress\r\nFrederick, the late King's eldest sister and Princess Royal of the\r\nUnited Kingdom.  Her Royal Highness had married the Crown Prince of\r\nPrussia, afterward the Emperor Frederick, in 1858, being then just\r\nover seventeen years of age.  For many years she spent part of each\r\nsummer in the old Schloss, just outside the little town; then later\r\nbuilt herself a showy villa on the other flank, and died there in\r\nAugust, 1901.  {404} I don't think the late King had ever revisited\r\nHomburg after that date.\r\n\r\nShe liked the place; liked its pure air, its scenery, the hills, and\r\nwoods amid which it lay embosomed; its pleasant walks and the\r\npleasant life its visitors led, and some of its residents, though,\r\nexcept the Princess herself, and the hotel-keepers and the garrison\r\nfor the time being, I hardly know who the residents were.  It was,\r\nmoreover, a great resort of invalids who were not ill enough to be\r\nsent to a serious cure.  Many a doctor, in London and elsewhere, had\r\nfor a maxim: \"When in doubt, choose Homburg.\"  Its waters could do\r\nyou no harm.  Its climate was sure to do you good.  And its\r\nanimation, its gaiety, its brilliancy even, during the six weeks'\r\nseason were all so many tonics for the _malade imaginaire_.\r\n\r\nSuch acquaintance as I had with the Crown Princess I owed to the late\r\nKing, who one day asked me if I knew his sister.  When I said no he\r\nanswered, \"Oh, but you should; I must arrange it,\" and proposed that\r\nI should come to tea the next afternoon at his villa, then the Villa\r\nImperiale, when the Crown Princess would be there.  Arriving, I found\r\nmyself the only guest.  I was presented to the Princess.  In figure,\r\nin face and manner, she was very like her mother, the late Queen.\r\nThe figure was not so stout, the face not so rubicund, the manner\r\nless simple, and therefore with less authority; but the resemblance\r\nin each particular was marked.  There was even a resemblance in\r\ndress; or it might be truer to say that both the late {405} Queen and\r\nher eldest daughter showed an indifference to the art of personal\r\nadornment.  Certain terms have become stereotyped in various worlds\r\nof art.  Early Victorian, mid-Victorian, or merely Victorian--are\r\nthese labels now used by way of compliment or even of mere\r\ndescription?  I am afraid they are one and all terms of\r\ndisparagement.  But it was said truly of the late Queen that it did\r\nnot matter what she wore.  Robes did not make the Queen.  Whatever\r\nshe wore she was Queen, and looked the Queen.\r\n\r\nThe Princess had, however, a much greater vivacity than her mother.\r\nAt moments it became restlessness, and the mind, I thought, could\r\nnever be in repose.  There was no beauty but there was distinction;\r\nand in this again she resembled the Queen.  After her marriage and\r\ndown to the day when the Emperor Frederick's death extinguished her\r\nambitions, the Princess had lived in a dream-world of her own\r\ncreation, of which I will say more in a moment.  Her beliefs were so\r\nstrong, her conviction that she knew what was best for those about\r\nher was so complete, that to these beliefs and this conviction the\r\nfacts had to adjust themselves as best they could.\r\n\r\nEven for the purpose of this audience that necessity became evident.\r\nI had been presented, of course, as an American.  Almost at once Her\r\nRoyal Highness plunged into American affairs.  She was keenly\r\ninterested in educational and social problems, and explained to me\r\nthe position of women in the United States with reference to these\r\n{406} problems.  It appeared she had a correspondent in Chicago, as I\r\nunderstood, a lady who had been presented to Her Royal Highness in\r\nBerlin, and from this lady had derived a whole budget of impressions.\r\nThey were extremely interesting, if only because they were, to me,\r\naltogether novel.  But as I was not asked to confirm them, I of\r\ncourse, said nothing.  Now and then a question was put which I\r\nanswered as well as I could, but for the most part the Princess's\r\ntalk flowed on smoothly and swiftly during the better part of an\r\nhour.  She talked with clearness, with energy, with an almost\r\napostolic fervour, the voice penetrating rather than melodious.  I\r\nsaid to myself: \"All this may be true of Chicago, but of what else is\r\nit true?\"  The Princess had indeed given Chicago as the source of her\r\ninformation, but it seemed to me that she generalized from the Windy\r\nCity to the rest of the United States, and of such part as I knew I\r\ndid not think it a good account.\r\n\r\nAfter a time Chicago was dismissed and the talk drifted away into\r\nless difficult channels.  But the position was always much the same.\r\nThe Princess talked and I listened; the most interesting of all\r\npositions.  I had heard--everybody had heard--a great deal about her\r\nviews on politics and on Anglo-German relations and on the internal\r\naffairs of Germany.  On some of these matters she touched briefly; on\r\nall she threw a bright light, for no matter what the immediate topic\r\nof her discourse, her attitude of mind toward other topics and toward\r\nhigher matters of State became visible.  {407} Never for a moment did\r\nthis stream of talk stop or grow sluggish.  Carlyle summed up\r\nMacaulay, for whom he had no great respect, in the phrase: \"Flow on,\r\nthou shining river.\"  He might, in a sardonic mood, have done the\r\nsame for this Princess.  After a time I found myself in a dilemma.\r\nAn hour and a half had passed; agreeably and brilliantly, but it had\r\npassed, and I had been for some time expecting the signal which would\r\nindicate that my audience was at an end.  It did not come.  The\r\nPrincess talked on.  I knew Her Royal Highness had a dinner\r\nengagement, and I knew I had, and it was already half-past six, and\r\nHomburg dinners are early.  Finally I said I was afraid I had abused\r\nHer Royal Highness's kindness, and might I be permitted to withdraw.\r\nThe permission was given, the Princess held out her hand, and I went.\r\n\r\nIt was an illuminating interview.  It threw light on events to come\r\nas well as on those of the past.  Here was a great lady, full of\r\nintelligence and gifts, yet taking views of great public questions\r\nwhich she held almost alone.  She had made many enemies.  She was to\r\nmake many more.  In Berlin I had heard much.  Prince Bismarck's\r\ndistrust of the Crown Princess, and of the Crown Prince on her\r\naccount, was known.  It was shared by multitudes of Germans.  They\r\nbelieved, rightly or wrongly, that she wanted to Anglicize Germany.\r\nHer ascendancy over her husband was believed to be complete, and\r\nbecause it was complete the day of the Crown Prince's accession to\r\nthe throne was expected with dread.  During his short reign of {408}\r\nthree months--March 9th to June 15th, 1888--these gloomy forecasts\r\ncould be neither confirmed nor dispelled.  But they existed, they\r\nwere general, and they modified the grief of the German people at the\r\nmelancholy ending of what had promised to be a great career.\r\n\r\nI suppose it must be said that the Crown Princess had furnished some\r\nmaterial for German forebodings as to a German future shaped by her\r\nor by her influence.  She talked openly.  She told all comers that\r\nwhat Germany needed was parliamentary government as it was understood\r\nand practised in England.  Against that the German face was set as\r\nflint.  In little things, as in great, she made no secret of her\r\npreference for what was English over what was German.  When the rooms\r\nthe Crown Prince and Crown Princess were to occupy in the Palace of\r\nCharlottenburg, outside Berlin, were to be refurnished, she insisted\r\non bringing upholsterers from London to do the work.  Naturally the\r\nBerlin people did not like that.\r\n\r\nJudgment was not her strong point, nor was tact.  If I am to say what\r\nwas her strong point I suppose it would be sincerity.  Her gifts of\r\nmind were dazzling rather than sound.  Her impulses were not always\r\nunder control.  Her animosities, once roused, never slept, as Prince\r\nBismarck well knew.  Her will was so vehement as sometimes to obscure\r\nher perceptions.  But hers was a loyal nature and whatever one may\r\nthink of her politics, it is impossible not to regret that the\r\npromise of a great ambition should have come to so tragic an end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n{409}\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nEDWARD THE SEVENTH AS PRINCE OF WALES--PERSONAL INCIDENTS\r\n\r\nEverything, or almost everything, has been said about King Edward the\r\nSeventh, every tribute paid him from every quarter of the world; and\r\nthe mourning of his people is the best tribute of all.  I should like\r\nto add an estimate from a different point of view and a tribute, but\r\nI suppose they would have no proper place in these papers, and I\r\nconfine myself therefore to memories.  I will go back to the period\r\nwhen he was Prince of Wales, and to the place where he put off most\r\nof the splendours belonging to his rank, and where most of the man\r\nhimself was to be seen; not once nor twice, but for years in\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\nHomburg was to the Prince of Wales a three weeks' holiday.  I do not\r\nthink he took the medical side of it very seriously.  He drank the\r\nwaters and walked, as the doctors bade him, but with respect to diet\r\nhe seemed to be his own doctor and his prescriptions were not severe.\r\nBut then nobody, the local physicians excepted, ever did take Homburg\r\n{410} very seriously as a cure.  What the Prince liked was the\r\nfreedom, of which he was himself the author.  On occasions of\r\nceremony and in the general course of his life at home, strict\r\netiquette was enforced.  At Homburg the Prince used his dispensing\r\npower and put aside everything but the essentials.  He lived in a\r\nhired villa.  He wore lounging suits in the daytime--sometimes of a\r\nrather flamboyant colour--and a soft grey hat.  In the evening a\r\nblack dining jacket, black tie, black waistcoat, black trousers, and\r\na soft black Homburg hat.  The silk hat and the dress coat and white\r\ntie or white waistcoat were unknown.  Most of the officers of his\r\nhousehold were left at home, but General Sir Stanley Clark was always\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nHis way of life was as informal as his dress.  He was there to amuse\r\nhimself and it was an art he understood perfectly.  Homburg is a\r\nvillage, but it had, or had at that time, many resources.  The three\r\nor four streets of which the place consisted were so many rendezvous\r\nfor the visitors.  The lawn-tennis grounds were another.  The walks\r\nin the woods were delightful.  There were drives over the hills and\r\nfar away, in the purest air in Germany.  If you tired of the little\r\nwatering-place or its guests, there was Frankfort, only eight miles\r\ndistant, with resources of a more varied kind.  But in Homburg itself\r\nthe Kursaal, though there had been no gambling since 1869, and the\r\nhotels, were always open and sometimes lively.\r\n\r\nWhat the Prince liked was society, in one form or another.  The\r\nopen-air life suited him.  It was {411} sufficiently formal but less\r\nformal than indoors.  He liked strolling about and meeting\r\nacquaintances or friends.  When you had once seen His Royal Highness\r\nleaning against the railings of a villa--the villa stood each in its\r\nown ground--and talking to a lady leaning out of the first floor\r\nwindow, and this interview lasting a quarter of an hour, you felt\r\nthat the conditions of life and the relations of royalty to other\r\nranks in life had taken on a quite new shape in Homburg.\r\n\r\nBut the attitude of respect was maintained.  Certain formalities were\r\nnever forgotten.  The Prince was always addressed as \"Sir\" or as\r\n\"Your Royal Highness.\"  But these observances were not irksome, nor\r\nwas conversation restricted or stiffened by the obligations of\r\ndeference or by the accepted conventionalities which, after all, were\r\nmore matters of form than of substance.  And in his most careless\r\nmoods the Prince had a dignity which was the more impressive for\r\nbeing apparently unconscious.  Nobody ever forgot what was due to\r\nhim; or ever forgot it twice.  It was an offence he did not pardon;\r\nor pardoned only in those who could not remember what they had never\r\nknown.  A foreigner, an American, who erred in pure ignorance might\r\ncount on forgiveness.\r\n\r\nThe Prince gave many luncheons and dinners, almost always at Ritter's\r\nor at the Kursaal.  I should think there was never a day when he did\r\nnot play the host.  The dinners at the Kursaal were given on the\r\nterrace, always crowded with other dinner-parties.  At Ritter's they\r\nwere on the {412} piazza.  This open-air hospitality was the\r\npleasanter because it was so seldom possible in England.  He had\r\nbrought the art of entertaining to perfection.  He put his guests,\r\neven those who stood most in awe of royalty, at their ease.  The\r\ncostume perhaps helped.  When a company of people were in dining\r\njackets and the men wearing their soft black hats, even at table, by\r\nthe Prince's command, etiquette became a less formidable thing.  The\r\nPrince talked easily, fluently, and well.  He might ask a guest whom\r\nhe liked to sit next him, ignoring distinctions of rank, but during\r\nthe dinner he would talk, sooner or later, to everybody.  There might\r\nbe a dozen guests, a number seldom exceeded.  I will give you one\r\nexample of the dialogue which went on, and no more.  The late Duke of\r\nDevonshire, at that time the Marquis of Hartington, was sitting\r\nnearly opposite the Prince, but at some distance, and this colloquy\r\ntook place:\r\n\r\n\"Hartington, you ought not to be drinking all that champagne.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir; I know I oughtn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why do you do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I have made up my mind that I had rather be ill now and\r\nthen than always taking care of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you think that now, but when the gout comes what do you think\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, if you will ask me then I will tell you.  I do not anticipate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince laughed and everybody laughed.  And Lord Hartington, for\r\nall his gout, lived to be {413} seventy-four, one of the truest\r\nEnglishmen of his time or of any time.\r\n\r\nAmong the Americans who were presented to the Prince at Homburg were\r\nMr. Depew and Mark Twain.  I was not in Homburg when Mr. Depew first\r\ncame, but I asked one of the Prince's equerries to arrange the\r\npresentation for Mr. Depew, and I wrote to Lady Cork begging her to\r\ndo what she could for him.  So the formalities were duly transacted.\r\nThe Prince took a liking to the American, asked him to dine, put him\r\non his right hand, and listened to his stories with delight.  He told\r\nme afterward that Depew was a new experience.  He asked him again and\r\nagain, and the next year also; I believe several years, or as long as\r\nDepew went to Homburg.  The Prince said:\r\n\r\n\"Depew's stories were not all good, but he told the bad ones so well\r\nthat they were better than the good.\"\r\n\r\nMy letter to Lady Cork had a fate I did not foresee, though I ought\r\nto have foreseen.  When she told the Prince that I had written her\r\nabout Depew she had my manuscript in her hand.  \"Is that Smalley's\r\nletter?  May I see it?\" asked the Prince; took it and read the whole.\r\nIt happened that I was staying at the time with one of her married\r\ndaughters, and there was a deal good of family gossip in the letter.\r\nWhen the Prince handed it back there was in his eyes a gleam of that\r\nhumour so often seen there, and he said:\r\n\r\n\"Now I know some of the things I have been wanting to know.\"\r\n\r\n{414}\r\n\r\nAnd Lady Cork answered:\r\n\r\n\"Sir, we have nothing to conceal from Your Royal Highness.\"\r\n\r\nThere was, of course, an intimacy which put the Prince on his honour.\r\n\r\nMark Twain was staying at Nauheim, some twelve miles away.  He had\r\ndriven into Homburg and was wandering about the place when he was\r\npointed out to the Prince, and was presented.  Mark Twain had at the\r\ntime no very great care about his personal appearance, and was very\r\nshabbily dressed.  He was the \"Tramp Abroad.\"  At first I don't think\r\nhe much interested the Prince.  His slowness of speech and his\r\nunusual intonations were not altogether prepossessing.  However, when\r\nhe had taken his leave the Prince seemed to think he wished to see\r\nhim again and said:\r\n\r\n\"I should like to ask him to dinner.  Do you think he has a dining\r\njacket?\"\r\n\r\nThe risk, whatever it might be, was taken, the invitation was sent,\r\nand Mark came to dinner, dining jacket and all.  But he did not care\r\nto adapt himself to the circumstances; considering, perhaps, that the\r\ncircumstances ought to adapt themselves to him.  The meeting was not\r\na great success, and, so far as I know, was never repeated.  Socially\r\nspeaking, the Mississippi Pilot was an _intransigeant_ at times, and\r\nthis was one of the times.  He could not, I suppose, overcome his\r\ndrawling manner of speech nor reduce his interminable stories to\r\ndinner-table limits.  He had the air of usurping more than his share\r\nof the conversation and of the time, which {415} he certainly did not\r\nmean to.  Intentions, unluckily, count for little.  Men are judged by\r\nwhat they do, and the general impression was not as favourable to\r\nMark on this occasion as it would have been if he had been better\r\nknown.  Among all Princes and Potentates there was never one more\r\nwilling to make allowances or less exacting in respect to trivial\r\nmatters than Mark's host.  But, after all, he was Prince of Wales and\r\nthe future King of England, and if you were not prepared to recognize\r\nthat, it was open to you to stay away.\r\n\r\nMark Twain, at any rate, was not one of the Americans who followed\r\nthe Prince to Homburg.  He met the Prince almost by accident, and\r\nreturned from Nauheim by the Prince's invitation for this not very\r\nsuccessful dinner.  His Republicanism was perhaps of a rebellious\r\nkind, and possibly, though without desiring to, he gave the Prince to\r\nunderstand as much.  Some of Mark's compatriots went far in the\r\nopposite direction, especially one or two American women.  There was\r\na handsome American girl who had found means to be presented to the\r\nPrince; no difficult matter for a pretty woman at any time.  Then she\r\nsent him a photograph of himself and begged him to sign it.  As I was\r\npassing the Prince one afternoon in the street he stopped me and\r\npulled a parcel out of his pocket, saying:\r\n\r\n\"This is a photograph Miss X. sent me to sign, and I have signed it,\r\nand I was just going to leave it for her at the hotel.  But I am\r\nafraid to.  I {416} don't know what she may not ask me next.  Would\r\nyou mind leaving it for me?\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince did not see, but as I went in I saw, on the porch, the\r\ngirl herself.  She must have looked on at what happened and I am not\r\nat all sure she did not hear what the Prince said.  None the less,\r\nshe accepted the signed photograph joyfully, and it always had a\r\nplace of honour in New York.  \"Wasn't it kind of His Royal Highness\r\nto give it to me?\" queried this beautiful being, not knowing that the\r\ntrue story had been told me.  When I made my report to the Prince I\r\nremarked casually that Miss X. had been sitting on the veranda and\r\nmight have seen what took place.  \"I hope she heard also,\" exclaimed\r\nthe Prince.  But he did not quite mean that.  At any rate, he\r\nrelented afterward and was seen to be talking to the girl, whose eyes\r\nhe could not but admire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nPRINCE OF WALES AND KING OF ENGLAND--THE PERSONAL SIDE\r\n\r\nI need not say much about the public life of the late King nor about\r\nthe part he played in the Empire of the world.  But there are certain\r\npassages in his private life and in his relations with the late Queen\r\nwhich had an effect on his career, and may be related in whole or in\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThe greatness of this reign is the more remarkable because experience\r\nof public affairs came to the {417} King late in life.  He was in his\r\nsixtieth year when he came to the Throne, and during the forty years\r\nwhen he might have been acquiring invaluable experience he had been\r\nsedulously excluded by the late Queen from all share in the business\r\nof State.  So much is known, and so much is sometimes stated in the\r\nEnglish Press, though stated with caution.  It is the truth, but it\r\nis not all the truth.  I believe it to be also true, that after the\r\ndeath of the Prince Consort, in 1861, the Queen desired the Prince of\r\nWales to take up some portion of the duties of his father, and\r\noffered him a place as her private secretary.  The Prince, for\r\nwhatever reason, declined it.\r\n\r\nHe was not much over twenty years of age, and never in any man,\r\nperhaps, was the desire of _la joie de vivre_ stronger.  Some years\r\nlater a truer sense of his position and duties and opportunities came\r\nto him.  He offered to accept, and besought the Queen's permission to\r\naccept, the post she had first offered him.  Her Majesty made answer\r\nthat the post had been filled, and never from that time onward did\r\nshe open to the Prince of Wales the door she then closed.  She left\r\nhim to amuse himself, to choose his own associates and his own\r\noccupations.  She herself spent six hours a day--never less, and\r\noften much more--in reading dispatches and State papers of all kinds.\r\nThe Prince saw none of them, was present at no interviews with\r\nMinisters, knew nothing at first hand of the conduct of affairs.\r\n\r\nYet the Prince had, in the face of these {418} discouragements, an\r\nappetite for public business.  He was well informed about it, but\r\nonly as an outsider is well informed.  Naturally, the opinion had\r\ngrown up that not much was to be expected of the Prince as King.  The\r\ndeath of the late Queen was thought to close an era.  It had not\r\noccurred to any one, except perhaps to his nearest friends, to think\r\nof the new King as well equipped for his Kingship.  True, Lord\r\nSalisbury, than whom there could be no higher authority, speaking in\r\nthe House of Lords, had said of the new King upon his accession that\r\nhe had \"a profound knowledge of the working of our constitution and\r\nconduct of our affairs.\"  Lord Salisbury had had his exceptional\r\nmeans of knowing, and he expressed his own opinion, a true opinion,\r\nbut not a general opinion.  I suppose Lord Rosebery, long intimate\r\nwith the Prince, might have said as much.  But to most men such\r\nexpressions came as a surprise.\r\n\r\nI met Sir Francis Jeune at dinner on the evening after the first\r\nPrivy Council held by the King, which Sir Francis had gone down to\r\nOsborne to attend.  He began at once to describe the scene:\r\n\r\n\"The King astonished us all.  We had all known him as Prince of\r\nWales.  It became clear we had yet to know him as King.  His air of\r\nauthority sat on him as if he had worn it always.  He spoke with\r\nweight, as a King should speak.  It was plain he had come to the\r\nThrone to rule.\"\r\n\r\nAsk the Ministers and other great personages who stood to him in\r\nofficial relations.  Mr. Asquith has answered for them all:\r\n\r\n{419}\r\n\r\n\"I speak from a privileged and close experience when I say that,\r\nwherever he was or whatever may have been his apparent\r\npreoccupations, in the transaction of the business of the State there\r\nwere never any arrears, there was never any trace of confusion, there\r\nwas never any moment of avoidable delay.\"\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the King their time and his belonged to the public,\r\nand neither was to be wasted.\r\n\r\nThe whole truth about the late King's mission to Paris has, I think,\r\nnever been told.  It was not expedient that it should be told at the\r\ntime, nor was it generally known.  But until it is known full justice\r\ncannot be done to the King's courage and wisdom, or to his direct\r\npersonal influence on the course of great affairs.  For it was the\r\nman himself, the King himself, who won this great victory; not by\r\ndiplomacy, not by statecraft, but because he was the man he was.  I\r\ntell the story briefly, but the outlines will be enough.\r\n\r\nWhen the King went to Paris to lay the foundations of a new\r\nfriendship between France and England the feeling of the French\r\nagainst the English ran high.  They had not forgotten nor forgiven\r\nthe sympathies of England with Germany in 1870.  They had not\r\nforgotten their own retreat from Egypt in 1882, and they scored up\r\ntheir own mistake against England.  They had not forgotten Fashoda.\r\nThe King was warned not to go.  The French Government warned him.\r\nThey could protect him, they said, against violence but not against\r\ninsult.  His own Government thought his visit, {420} in the\r\ncircumstances, ill-advised.  Against all this he set his own\r\nconviction that the moment had come to make an effort for a better\r\nunderstanding between the two peoples.  Danger did not deter him.\r\nFor personal danger he cared nothing, and against the danger that any\r\ndiscourtesy to himself might embitter the two nations he set the hope\r\nof success.  Like the statesman he was, he calculated forces and\r\ncalculated wisely.  He knew that the French, and especially the\r\nParisians, had always liked him personally and he resolved to risk it.\r\n\r\nNeither his courage nor his sagacity was at fault.  At first things\r\nwent badly.  When he reached the railway station he was received in\r\nsilence.  When he drove from the station to the Embassy there was not\r\na cheer.  As he went about Paris the next day the attitude of the\r\nParisians was still sullen, if not hostile.  But the presence and\r\npersonality of the King began after a time to soften hardness.\r\nBefore nightfall a cheer or two had been heard in the streets, and\r\nnext day all Paris was once more all smiles and applause.  The King\r\nhad conquered.  He had won over the people.  He had convinced\r\nMinisters.  He had conciliated public opinion.  He had laid a gentle\r\nhand upon old and still open wounds.  He had shown himself for the\r\nfirst time a great instrument and messenger of peace, and had begun\r\nthe work to which all the rest of his life was to be devoted.\r\n\r\nLong before that ever-memorable visit, in France as in England, the\r\nPrince knew all sorts of people, {421} and was popular with all, and\r\ndid not mind being of service now and then to the people whom he did\r\nnot know at all.  Dining one night with the Duc de la\r\nRochefoucauld-Bisaccia in the Faubourg St. Germain, he was asked by\r\nhis host to go with him to the opening reception at the house of a\r\nbanker in the Boulevard Haussmann.  The banker had made a great\r\nfortune and had great social ambitions.  The Prince knew very well\r\nwhy he was asked, but good-naturedly went.  His going was chronicled\r\nand blazoned next day in every one of the seventy daily papers of\r\nParis; and the banker's ambition was satisfied.\r\n\r\nThat was one incident.  Another was his presence of course in the\r\nPrince of Wales period, at a supper given by the _Figaro_ in its new\r\noffices.  Celebrities of all sorts were there, and the Prince had to\r\nsit still while a too well-known actress from the Bouffes proposed\r\nthe Queen's health.  He raised his glass drank the toast, and said\r\nnothing.  It was no fault of his.  This also found its way into the\r\nFrench papers; not into the English.  He had many friendships among\r\nartists, men of letters, soldiers, statesmen.  Between the Prince and\r\nthe late Marquis de Galliffet, the Marshal Ney of this last\r\ngeneration, there was a close tie; two chivalrous souls who\r\nunderstood each other from the beginning.  He was often to be seen in\r\nstudios--M. Detaille's, M. Rodin's, and many others.  He knew the\r\ntheatres in Paris as well as he knew the theatres in London; perhaps\r\nbetter.  He went to the theatre primarily, I think, to be amused, and\r\nthe theatres {422} in Paris are more amusing than the theatres in\r\nLondon.  The most patriotic Englishman may be content to admit that.\r\n\r\nIf the Prince had any politics abroad they were kept for his private\r\nuse.  To the French Republic, as Republic, and to successive\r\nPresidents of the Republic, he showed nothing but good-will.  To\r\nFrench statesmen the same; to Gambetta, to Waldeck-Rousseau, and to\r\nM. Clemenceau, whose originalities and courage interested him long\r\nbefore that energetic individuality had become Prime Minister.  They\r\nall liked the Prince, but not one of them ever guessed that from him\r\nwhen King would spring the new impulse of friendship which was to\r\nmake France and England in all but name allies, and so impose peace\r\nupon the restless ambitions of another great sovereign.  Gambetta, it\r\nis true, foretold a splendid future for the Prince, without\r\nexplaining how it was to be splendid.\r\n\r\nI think if you moved about among Englishmen one thing would impress\r\nyou more than all others in their tributes to their late King.  Not\r\ntheir full testimony to his greatness as King.  Not their admiration\r\nof his capacities.  Not their pride in him as a Ruler.  Not their\r\nsense of the incalculable services he has rendered.  Not their\r\ngratitude for these services, deep as that is.  Not the Imperial\r\nspirit and the new value they set upon the Unity of the Empire.  Not\r\nhis virtues of any kind, though to all of them they bear witness.\r\n\r\nThe one thing which would impress you beyond all this is the\r\naffection they bore to him in his lifetime {423} and now bear to his\r\nmemory.  He had known how to establish new relations between King and\r\nPeople, relations which had a tenderness and a beauty unknown before.\r\nThey belonged to an earlier period of history.  They were not quite\r\npatriarchal, as in really ancient days, but were like the relations\r\nwhich exist in an old family: ties of blood and of long descent.\r\nThey did not exist in the last reign.  There was immense respect for\r\nQueen Victoria; not much sentiment.  She had withdrawn herself too\r\nmuch from general intercourse, and even from the ceremonial part of\r\nher royal duties.  But this King, her son, went among the people,\r\nlived among them, lived for them, gave them his constant thought, won\r\ntheir hearts.  His loss is to them a personal loss.  They mourn for\r\nhim as for a King, and they mourn for him as for a Friend who is\r\ngone.  That seems to me the finest tribute of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAS KING--SOME PERSONAL AND SOCIAL INCIDENTS AND IMPRESSIONS\r\n\r\nI met at luncheon one of the King's friends, in some ways one among\r\nthe most intimate of the innumerable friends he had; a man, however,\r\nnot readily yielding to emotion nor likely to take what is called the\r\nsentimental view.  We began to talk of the King.  Suddenly he broke\r\noff:\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say much.  I loved him.\"\r\n\r\nI don't know that I can tell you anything more {424} characteristic\r\nor illuminating than that.  It is the kind of tribute the King\r\nhimself would have liked.  And there are millions of Englishmen\r\nto-day whose hearts are full of the same feeling.\r\n\r\nThe King--the late King--was a great master of kingly graces.  He\r\nknew, I suppose, more men and women than any man of his time.  He\r\nknew the exact degree of consideration to which each one of them was\r\nentitled, and exactly how to express it.  If you desire to form to\r\nyourself a conception of the interval which divides a king, with the\r\ninherited traditions of a thousand years, from the elected Chief\r\nMagistrate of yesterday, you might do worse than watch the ceremonial\r\ncustoms of personal intercourse.  We know what the indiscriminate\r\nhandshakings by the President are.  We know that the custom, aided by\r\nthe incredible stupidity of the police about him, cost one of them\r\nhis life.  We read the other day that a President, after enduring\r\nthis exaction for a time, had to stop it.  His right hand was all but\r\nparalysed.  We have all listened to the Presidential, \"I am very glad\r\nto see you,\" repeated to all comers.  It may be unavoidable but it\r\nall detracts something from the dignity of the office and the man.\r\n\r\nThis King who is gone gave his hand more often than any other; but at\r\nhis own choice and discretion.  It was thought abroad he went great\r\nlengths, and some of the Continental sovereigns and the courtiers\r\nabout them criticized him.  They also after a time imitated him, and\r\nsometimes at once.  The present German Emperor was one of those who\r\ntook the {425} hint from his uncle as soon as it was given.  I told\r\nlong ago how the Emperor and the then Prince of Wales in 1889 came on\r\nboard the White Star steamship _Teutonic_ lying at Spithead, with a\r\ngreat company of naval guests, there to witness the great naval\r\nreview which never took place.  The First Lord of the Admiralty, Mr.\r\nChamberlain, Lord Charles Beresford, Mr. Ismay, Mr. Depew, and many\r\nother persons of distinction were grouped on the main deck.  The\r\nEmperor came up the steps first, and by way of acknowledging their\r\nsalutations raised his white cap.  The Prince of Wales shook hands\r\nwith all those I have named and with some others, the Emperor looking\r\non astonished.  Then came a prolonged inspection of the _Teutonic_,\r\nthe finest passenger ship then afloat, the pioneer of all modern\r\ncomfort and splendour on the Atlantic, Mr. Ismay's creation.  There\r\nhad been much talk in which Emperor and Prince had both taken part,\r\nand by the time they were ready to leave, the great German sovereign\r\nhad learned his lesson.  He shook hands cordially with Mr. Ismay, in\r\nwhom he had recognized a kindred spirit of greatness, other than his\r\nown but not less genuine, and with others.  The faces of his staff\r\nwere the faces of men amazed, perplexed, almost incredulous.\r\n\r\nAt drawing-rooms and Courts and levees; in private houses where he\r\nwas a guest, whether in town or country, on the turf, in the theatre,\r\nat a public ceremonial, at a Marlborough House or Windsor\r\ngarden-party, the same habit prevailed.  Prince of Wales or King of\r\nEngland, he met his {426} friends as a friend, and for acquaintances\r\nwith any title to recognition he had a pleasant welcome.  It added\r\nimmensely to his popularity among those who knew him, and among the\r\nmillions who never saw him, but heard.  They thought of him as a man\r\namong men, which he was in every sense, and as one who thought\r\nmanhood an honourable thing.  Ask, moreover, any of the equerries or\r\nothers of his household.  They will all tell you he was considerate.\r\nHe expected each officer to do his duty, and it was done.  It is\r\noften an irksome duty; but he made it needlessly so.\r\n\r\nThe human side of him was never long hidden.  It is a remark one is\r\ntempted to repeat again and again.  It came out in the services he\r\nwas for ever doing; public in their nature, but from a private\r\nimpulse.  He met to the full the expectation of the public, and\r\ndischarged to the full the obligation of the Crown in respect of all\r\ncharities and ceremonials; and always with a kindly grace which made\r\nhis presence and his gifts doubly welcome.\r\n\r\nWith people whom he knew well and liked he was glad to lay aside\r\netiquette.  I could give you, but must not, the names of friends to\r\nwhom he would often send word in the afternoon that he was coming to\r\ndine that evening and to play bridge after.  Even a king, and a great\r\nking, must sometimes relax.  He cannot always appear in armour.  His\r\nhostess would meet him at the door with a curtsey, and then welcome\r\nhim as a friend; and the talk all through dinner was intimate and\r\nfree.  Those were delightful hours.  So were the days in country\r\n{427} houses where the King was a guest.  Always, no doubt, a certain\r\nhush in the atmosphere, a certain constraint if the party was large,\r\nbut so far as the King was concerned, if people were not at their\r\nease it was their own fault.  Everybody knew where the line was\r\ndrawn.  Nobody in his senses over-passed it.  One flagrant instance\r\nthere was, not in the country, but at a house in London, at supper--a\r\nlarge party.  The hour grew late and the Prince still sat at his\r\ntable.  A guest who had found the champagne to his liking staggered\r\nacross the room, steadied himself by a chair and stuttered out:\r\n\r\n\"I don't know whether Your Royal Highness knows how late it is, but\r\nit's past two o'clock, and I am going home.  Good-night, sir!\"\r\n\r\nThe Prince sat still and answered not.  He saw the man's condition.\r\nNobody knew better the rule that such a company did not break up till\r\nthe Prince gave the signal.  He was a man with a great social\r\nposition, and not social only.  When he had departed the Prince\r\nfinished his interrupted sentence and the talk went on as before.\r\nNot an allusion to the offence or the offender.\r\n\r\nHis sense of social responsibility showed itself in an unexpected\r\nform during the Boer War.  There grew up among the aristocracy a\r\npassionate patriotism which sent heads of great families and elder\r\nand younger sons into the field.  The King thought this feeling\r\nthreatened to have grave consequences.  He approved it, of course,\r\nand encouraged it, but he thought limits ought to be set to a fervour\r\nwhich {428} seemed not unlikely to extinguish an important part of\r\nthe nobility.  He sent for a number of men in great position who had\r\nresolved to go and advised them to wait, saying, with his usual good\r\nsense:\r\n\r\n\"Enough men of your class have gone already to show your devotion;\r\nmore than are really needed for the purposes of war.  Wait a little.\r\nIf matters go badly it will be time enough then for you to depart.\"\r\n\r\nOne secret of the extraordinary social power of both Prince and King\r\nlay in his knowledge of social matters.  Nobody was so well informed.\r\nHe had about him numbers of men, and of women, who took pains to send\r\nhim, or bring him, the earliest account of any social incident or\r\ngossip.  It was known that he had these sources of information, and\r\nthat whatever was known to any one was known to him.  Such knowledge\r\nas that was a weapon.  It was not one of which he made use, or needed\r\nto use.  The fact that he had it was enough.\r\n\r\nHe liked news also, and took pains to get it.  If there were a\r\npolitical or Ministerial crisis, you might be sure that Marlborough\r\nHouse knew all about it.  He had a certain number of men in his suite\r\nor of his acquaintance from whom he expected, and generally got,\r\nearly intelligence.  There was a sort of competition in supplying\r\nhim.  If you were first you were thanked.  If you had been\r\nanticipated, he remarked dryly and with a good-humoured twinkle in\r\nhis very expressive eyes: \"Oh, yes, very interesting but I heard it\r\nan hour ago.\"\r\n\r\n{429}\r\n\r\nWhen I was leaving England in 1895 for America the Prince gave me his\r\ncipher address and asked me to cable him as often as there was news I\r\nthought might interest him.  That may serve to show us Americans how\r\nmuch he cared for American matters, and how completely he returned\r\nthe good-will we have always borne him since his visit to the United\r\nStates in 1860.  I told the Prince my first duty was to _The Times_,\r\nsince I was going home as their correspondent.  Subject to that, I\r\nshould be glad to send him what I could.  The difference of time was\r\nsuch that he might well enough get a dispatch before midnight at\r\nMarlborough House, which could not appear in print till next morning.\r\n\"But you know that's just what I should like,\" said the Prince.\r\n\r\nFrom beginning to end the late King has lived his life, ever a full\r\nlife, possibly not always a wise life.  Who can be wise always?  Who\r\nlikes a man who is always wise?  His faults in youth were of a kind\r\nwhich were recognized as belonging to men.  The blood which flowed in\r\nhis veins came down to him through centuries of ancestors to whom the\r\nrestrictions and pudencies, often hypocritical, of modern days were\r\nunknown.  And if we look at the result, at the crown of all, at the\r\nmatured character which made him one of the greatest servants of the\r\nState, of any State, ever known in history, need there be any\r\ncriticism or any regret?  Not perhaps the white flower of a blameless\r\nlife, but was there ever one?  But a great human life, compact of\r\ngood and ill, and so flowering into the {430} greatness of a great\r\nKing.  Perhaps the best summary is Pascal's:\r\n\r\n\"_Qu'une vie est heureuse quand elle commence par l'amour et qu'elle\r\nfinit par l'ambition._\"\r\n\r\nFor the King's ambition was never for himself; he had no need to wish\r\nto be other than he was.  It was an ambition for the good of his\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNDX\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\nAberdeen, Lady, influence of, in Canada--her zeal for Irish Home\r\nRule, 279-280\r\n\r\nAberdeen, Lord, Governor-General of Canada, 279; succeeded by Lord\r\nMinto, 281\r\n\r\nAbolitionists, the, counsels of, governed by Phillips, 104; desire to\r\nadopt legal measures, 108; meetings held by, 33-35, 85; unprotected\r\nby police against the rioters, 99, 100\r\n\r\nAdams, Charles Francis, American minister in England, 49; his\r\nservices to his country, 194-5; introduction to, 196\r\n\r\nAdams, John, rank of, as a diplomatist, 194\r\n\r\nAgassiz, Professor, influence of, on thought in Massachusetts, 11, 212\r\n\r\nAirlie, Earl of, remarkable legend in family of, 396-401\r\n\r\nAlaskan Boundary Question, 260-276\r\n\r\nAlcott, Mr., attempt of, to enter Boston Court House during the riot,\r\n35\r\n\r\nAllibone, Mr., on writings of R.
