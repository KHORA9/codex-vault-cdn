Houghton, Mifflin & Co., requested\r\nme to write a small book on Civil Government in the United States,\r\nwhich might be useful as a text-book, and at the same time serviceable\r\nand suggestive to the general reader interested in American history.\r\nIn preparing the book certain points have been kept especially in\r\nview, and deserve some mention here.\r\n\r\nIt seemed desirable to adopt a historical method of exposition, not\r\nsimply describing our political institutions in their present shape,\r\nbut pointing out their origin, indicating some of the processes\r\nthrough which they have acquired that present shape, and thus keeping\r\nbefore the student's mind the fact that government is perpetually\r\nundergoing modifications in adapting itself to new conditions.\r\nInasmuch as such gradual changes in government do not make themselves,\r\nbut are made by men--and made either for better or for worse--it is\r\nobvious that the history of political institutions has serious lessons\r\nto teach us. The student should as soon as possible come to understand\r\nthat every institution is the outgrowth of experiences. One probably\r\ngets but little benefit from abstract definitions and axioms\r\nconcerning the rights of men and the nature of civil society, such as\r\nwe often find at the beginning of books on government. Metaphysical\r\ngeneralizations are well enough in their place, but to start with such\r\nthings--as the French philosophers of the eighteenth century were fond\r\nof doing--is to get the cart before the horse. It is better to have\r\nour story first, and thus find out what government in its concrete\r\nreality has been, and is. Then we may finish up with the metaphysics,\r\nor do as I have done--leave it for somebody else.\r\n\r\nI was advised to avoid the extremely systematic, intrusively\r\nsymmetrical, style of exposition, which is sometimes deemed\r\nindispensable in a book of this sort. It was thought that students\r\nwould be more likely to become interested in the subject if it were\r\ntreated in the same informal manner into which one naturally falls in\r\ngiving lectures to young people. I have endeavoured to bear this in\r\nmind without sacrificing that lucidity in the arrangement of topics\r\nwhich is always the supreme consideration. For many years I have been\r\nin the habit of lecturing on history to college students in different\r\nparts of the United States, to young ladies in private schools, and\r\noccasionally to the pupils in high and normal schools, and in writing\r\nthis little book I have imagined an audience of these earnest and\r\nintelligent young friends gathered before me.\r\n\r\nI was especially advised--by my friend, Mr. James MacAlister,\r\nsuperintendent of schools in Philadelphia, for whose judgment I have\r\nthe highest respect--to make it a _little_ book, less than three\r\nhundred pages in length, if possible. Teachers and pupils do not have\r\ntime enough to deal properly with large treatises. Brevity, therefore,\r\nis golden. A concise manual is the desideratum, touching lightly upon\r\nthe various points, bringing out their relationships distinctly, and\r\nreferring to more elaborate treatises, monographs, and documents, for\r\nthe use of those who wish to pursue the study at greater length.\r\n\r\nWithin limits thus restricted, it will probably seem strange to\r\nsome that so much space is given to the treatment of local\r\ninstitutions,--comprising the governments of town, county, and city.\r\nIt may be observed, by the way, that some persons apparently conceive\r\nof the state also as a \"local institution.\" In a recent review of\r\nProfessor Howard's admirable \"Local Constitutional History of the\r\nUnited States,\" we read, the first volume, which is all that is yet\r\npublished, treats of the development of the township, hundred, and\r\nshire; the second volume, we suppose, being designed to treat of\r\nthe State Constitutions. The reviewer forgets that there is such a\r\nsubject as the \"development of the city and local magistracies\" (which\r\nis to be the subject of that second volume), and lets us see that in\r\nhis apprehension the American state is an institution of the same\r\norder as the town and county. We can thus readily assent when we\r\nare told that many youth have grown to manhood with so little\r\nappreciation of the political importance of the state as to believe\r\nit nothing more than a geographical division.[1] In its historic\r\ngenesis, the American state is not an institution of the same order\r\nas the town and county, nor has it as yet become depressed or\r\n\"mediatized\" to that degree. The state, while it does not possess such\r\nattributes of sovereignty as were by our Federal Constitution granted\r\nto the United States, does, nevertheless, possess many very important\r\nand essential characteristics of a sovereign body, as is here\r\npointed out on pages 172-177. The study of our state governments is\r\ninextricably wrapped up with the study of our national government,\r\nin such wise that both are parts of one subject, which cannot be\r\nunderstood unless both parts are studied. Whether in the course of our\r\ncountry's future development we shall ever arrive at a stage in which\r\nthis is not the case, must be left for future events to determine.\r\nBut, if we ever do arrive at such a stage, \"American institutions\"\r\nwill present a very different aspect from those with which we are now\r\nfamiliar, and which we have always been accustomed (even, perhaps,\r\nwithout always understanding them) to admire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Young's _Government Class Book_, p. iv.]\r\n\r\nThe study of local government properly includes town, county, and\r\ncity. To this part of the subject I have devoted about half of my\r\nlimited space, quite unheedful of the warning which I find in the\r\npreface of a certain popular text-book, that \"to learn the duties of\r\ntown, city, and county officers, has nothing whatever to do with the\r\ngrand and noble subject of Civil Government,\" and that \"to attempt\r\nclass drill on petty town and county offices, would be simply\r\nburlesque of the whole subject.\" But, suppose one were to say, with\r\nan air of ineffable scorn, that petty experiments on terrestrial\r\ngravitation and radiant heat, such as can be made with commonplace\r\npendulums and tea-kettles, have nothing whatever to do with the grand\r\nand noble subject of Physical Astronomy! Science would not have got\r\nvery far on that plan, I fancy. The truth is, that science, while it\r\nis perpetually dealing with questions of magnitude, and knows very\r\nwell what is large and what is small, knows nothing whatever of any\r\nsuch distinction as that between things that are \"grand\" and things\r\nthat are \"petty.\" When we try to study things in a scientific spirit,\r\nto learn their modes of genesis and their present aspects, in order\r\nthat we may foresee their tendencies, and make our volitions count\r\nfor something in modifying them, there is nothing which we may safely\r\ndisregard as trivial. This is true of whatever we can study; it is\r\neminently true of the history of institutions. Government is not a\r\nroyal mystery, to be shut off, like old Deiokes,[2] by a sevenfold\r\nwall from the ordinary business of life. Questions of civil government\r\nare practical business questions, the principles of which are as often\r\nand as forcibly illustrated in a city council or a county board of\r\nsupervisors, as in the House of Representatives at Washington. It is\r\npartly because too many of our citizens fail to realize that local\r\ngovernment is a worthy study, that we find it making so much trouble\r\nfor us. The \"bummers\" and \"boodlers\" do not find the subject beneath\r\ntheir notice; the Master who inspires them is wide awake and--for a\r\ncreature that divides the hoof--extremely intelligent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Herodotus, i. 98.]\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, the mental training gained through contact with\r\nlocal government that enables the people of a community to conduct\r\nsuccessfully, through their representatives, the government of the\r\nstate and the nation. And so it makes a great deal of difference\r\nwhether the government of a town or county is of one sort or another.\r\nIf the average character of our local governments for the past quarter\r\nof a century had been _quite_ as high as that of the Boston\r\ntown-meeting or the Virginia boards of county magistrates, in the days\r\nof Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry, who can doubt that many an airy\r\ndemagogue, who, through session after session, has played his pranks\r\nat the national capital, would long ago have been abruptly recalled to\r\nhis native heath, a sadder if not a wiser man? We cannot expect the\r\nnature of the aggregate to be much better than the average natures\r\nof its units. One may hear people gravely discussing the difference\r\nbetween Frenchmen and Englishmen in political efficiency, and\r\nresorting to assumed ethnological causes to explain it, when, very\r\nlikely, to save their lives they could not describe the difference\r\nbetween a French commune and an English parish. To comprehend the\r\ninteresting contrasts between Gambetta in the Chamber of Deputies, and\r\nGladstone in the House of Commons, one should begin with a historical\r\ninquiry into the causes, operating through forty generations, which\r\nhave frittered away self-government in the rural districts and small\r\ntowns of France, until there is very little left. If things in America\r\never come to such a pass that the city council of Cambridge must ask\r\nCongress each year how much money it can be allowed to spend for\r\nmunicipal purposes, while the mayor of Cambridge holds his office\r\nsubject to removal by the President of the United States, we may\r\nsafely predict further extensive changes in the character of the\r\nAmerican people and their government. It was not for nothing that our\r\nprofoundest political thinker, Thomas Jefferson, attached so much\r\nimportance to the study of the township.\r\n\r\nIn determining the order of exposition, I have placed local government\r\nfirst, beginning with the township as the simplest unit. It is well to\r\ntry to understand what is near and simple, before dealing with what is\r\nremote and complex. In teaching geography with maps, it is wise to get\r\nthe pupil interested in the streets of his own town, the country roads\r\nrunning out of it, and the neighbouring hills and streams, before\r\nburdening his attention with the topographical details of Borrioboola\r\nGha. To study grand generalizations about government, before attending\r\nto such of its features as come most directly before us, is to run the\r\nrisk of achieving a result like that attained by the New Hampshire\r\nschool-boy, who had studied geology in a text-book, but was not aware\r\nthat he had ever set eyes upon an igneous rock.\r\n\r\nAfter the township, naturally comes the county. The city, as is here\r\nshown, is not simply a larger town, but is much more complex in\r\norganization. Historically, many cities have been, or still are,\r\nequivalent to counties; and the development of the county must be\r\nstudied before we can understand that of the city. It has been briefly\r\nindicated how these forms of local government grew up in England, and\r\nhow they have become variously modified in adapting themselves to\r\ndifferent social conditions in different parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nNext in order come the general governments, those which possess and\r\nexert, in one way or another, attributes of sovereignty. First, the\r\nvarious colonial governments have been considered, and some features\r\nof their metamorphosis into our modern state governments have been\r\ndescribed. In the course of this study, our attention is called to\r\nthe most original and striking feature of the development of civil\r\ngovernment upon American soil,--the written constitution, with the\r\naccompanying power of the courts in certain cases to annul the acts\r\nof the legislature. This is not only the most original feature of our\r\ngovernment, but it is in some respects the most important. Without the\r\nSupreme Court, it is not likely that the Federal Union could have been\r\nheld together, since Congress has now and then passed an act which the\r\npeople in some of the states have regarded as unconstitutional and\r\ntyrannical; and in the absence of a judicial method of settling such\r\nquestions, the only available remedy would have been nullification. I\r\nhave devoted a brief chapter to the origin and development of written\r\nconstitutions, and the connection of our colonial charters therewith.\r\n\r\nLastly, we come to the completed structure, the Federal Union; and by\r\nthis time we have examined so many points in the general theory\r\nof American government, that our Federal Constitution can be more\r\nconcisely described, and (I believe) more quickly understood, than if\r\nwe had made it the subject of the first chapter instead of the last.\r\nIn conclusion, there have been added a few brief hints and suggestions\r\nwith reference to our political history. These remarks have been\r\nintentionally limited. It is no part of the purpose of this book\r\nto give an account of the doings of political parties under the\r\nConstitution. But its study may fitly be supplemented by that of\r\nProfessor Alexander Johnston's \"History of American Politics.\"\r\n\r\nThis arrangement not only proceeds from the simpler forms of\r\ngovernment to the more complex, but it follows the historical order of\r\ndevelopment. From time immemorial, and down into the lowest strata\r\nof savagery that have come within our ken, there have been clans and\r\ntribes; and, as is here shown, a township was originally a stationary\r\nclan, and a county was originally a stationary tribe. There were\r\ntownships and counties (or equivalent forms of organization) before\r\nthere were cities. In like manner there were townships, counties, and\r\ncities long before there was anything in the world that could properly\r\nbe called a state. I have remarked below upon the way in which English\r\nshires coalesced into little states, and in course of time the English\r\nnation was formed by the union of such little states, which lost their\r\nstatehood (_i.e._, their functions of sovereignty, though not\r\ntheir self-government within certain limits) in the process. Finally,\r\nin America, we see an enormous nationality formed by the federation\r\nof states which partially retain their statehood; and some of these\r\nstates are themselves of national dimensions, as, for example, New\r\nYork, which is nearly equal in area, quite equal in population, and\r\nfar superior in wealth, to Shakespeare's England.\r\n\r\nIn studying the local institutions of our different states, I have been\r\ngreatly helped by the \"Johns Hopkins University Studies in History and\r\nPolitics,\" of which the eighth annual series is now in course of\r\npublication. In the course of the pages below I have frequent occasion\r\nto acknowledge my indebtedness to these learned and sometimes profoundly\r\nsuggestive monographs; but I cannot leave the subject without a special\r\nword of gratitude to my friend, Dr. Herbert Adams, the editor of the\r\nseries, for the noble work which he is doing in promoting the study of\r\nAmerican history. It had always seemed to me that the mere existence of\r\nprinted questions in text-books proves that the publishers must have\r\nrather a poor opinion of the average intelligence of teachers; and it\r\nalso seemed as if the practical effect of such questions must often be\r\nto make the exercise of recitation more mechanical for both teachers and\r\npupils, and to encourage the besetting sin of \"learning by heart.\"\r\nNevertheless, there are usually two sides to a case; and, in deference\r\nto the prevailing custom, for which, no doubt, there is much to be said,\r\nfull sets of questions have been appended to each chapter and section.\r\nIt seemed desirable that such questions should be prepared by some one\r\nespecially familiar with the use of school-books; and for these I have\r\nto thank Mr. F.A. Hill, Head Master of the Cambridge English High\r\nSchool. I confess that Mr. Hill's questions have considerably modified\r\nmy opinion as to the merits of such apparatus. They seem to add very\r\nmaterially to the usefulness of the book.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that there are two sets of these questions,\r\nentirely distinct in character and purpose. The first set--\"Questions\r\non the Text\"--is appended to each _section_, so as to be as near\r\nthe text as possible. These questions furnish an excellent topical\r\nanalysis of the text.[3] In a certain sense they ask \"what the book\r\nsays,\" but the teacher is advised emphatically to discourage any such\r\nthing as committing the text to memory. The tendency to rote-learning\r\nis very strong. I had to contend with it in teaching history to\r\nseniors at Harvard twenty years ago, but much has since been done\r\nto check it through the development of the modern German seminary\r\nmethods. (For an explanation of these methods, see Dr. Herbert\r\nAdams on \"Seminary Libraries and University Extension,\" _J.H.U.\r\nStudies_, V., xi.) With younger students the tendency is of course\r\nstronger. It is only through much exercise that the mind learns how\r\nto let itself--as Matthew Arnold used to say--\"play freely about the\r\nfacts.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: \"This,\" says Mr. Hill, \"will please those who prefer the\r\ntopical method, while it does not forbid the easy transformation\r\nof topics to questions, which others may demand.\" In the table of\r\ncontents I have made a pretty full topical analysis of the book, which\r\nmay prove useful for comparison with Mr. Hill's.]\r\n\r\nIn order to supply the pupil with some wholesome exercise of this\r\nsort, Mr. Hill has added, at the end of each _chapter_, a set of\r\n\"Suggestive Questions and Directions.\" Here he has thoroughly divined\r\nthe purpose of the book and done much to further it.\r\n\r\nProblems or cases are suggested for the student to consider, and\r\nquestions are asked which cannot be disposed of by a direct appeal to\r\nthe text. Sometimes the questions go quite outside of the text, and\r\nrelate to topics concerning which it provides no information whatever.\r\nThis has been done with a purpose. The pupil should learn how to go\r\noutside of the book and gather from scattered sources information\r\nconcerning questions that the book suggests. In other words, he should\r\nbegin to learn _how to make researches_, for that is coming to be\r\none of the useful arts, not merely for scholars, but for men and\r\nwomen in many sorts of avocations. It is always useful, as well as\r\nennobling, to be able to trace knowledge to its sources. Work of this\r\nsort involves more or less conference and discussion among classmates,\r\nand calls for active aid from the teacher; and if the teacher does not\r\nat first feel at home in these methods, practice will nevertheless\r\nbring familiarity, and will prove most wholesome training. For the aid\r\nof teachers and pupils, as well as of the general reader who wishes to\r\npursue the subject, I have added a bibliographical note at the end of\r\neach chapter, immediately after Mr. Hill's \"Suggestive Questions and\r\nDirections.\"\r\n\r\nThis particular purpose in my book must be carefully borne in mind.\r\nIt explains the omission of many details which some text-books on the\r\nsame subject would be sure to include. To make a manual complete and\r\nself-sufficing is precisely what I have not intended. The book is\r\ndesigned to be suggestive and stimulating, to leave the reader with\r\nscant information on some points, to make him (as Mr. Samuel Weller\r\nsays) \"vish there wos more,\" and to show him how to go on by himself.\r\nI am well aware that, in making an experiment in this somewhat new\r\ndirection, nothing is easier than to fall into errors of judgment. I\r\ncan hardly suppose that this book is free from such errors; but if in\r\nspite thereof it shall turn out to be in any way helpful in bringing\r\nthe knowledge and use of the German seminary method into our higher\r\nschools, I shall be more than satisfied.\r\n\r\nJust here, let me say to young people in all parts of our country:--If\r\nyou have not already done so, it would be well worth while for you\r\nto organize a debating society in your town or village, for the\r\ndiscussion of such historical and practical questions relating to the\r\ngovernment of the United States as are suggested in the course of this\r\nbook. Once started, there need be no end of interesting and profitable\r\nsubjects for discussion. As a further guide to the books you need\r\nin studying such subjects, use Mr. W.E. Foster's \"References to the\r\nConstitution of the United States,\" the invaluable pamphlet mentioned\r\nbelow on page 277. If you cannot afford to buy the books, get the\r\npublic library of your town or village to buy them; or, perhaps,\r\norganize a small special library for your society or club. Librarians\r\nwill naturally feel interested in such a matter, and will often\r\nbe able to help with advice. A few hours every week spent in such\r\nwholesome studies cannot fail to do much toward the political\r\neducation of the local community, and thus toward the general\r\nimprovement of the American people. For the amelioration of things\r\nwill doubtless continue to be effected in the future, as it has been\r\neffected in the past, not by ambitious schemes of sudden and universal\r\nreform (which the sagacious man always suspects, just as he\r\nsuspects all schemes for returning a fabulously large interest upon\r\ninvestments), but by the gradual and cumulative efforts of innumerable\r\nindividuals, each doing something to help or instruct those to whom\r\nhis influence extends. He who makes two clear ideas grow where there\r\nwas only one hazy one before, is the true benefactor of his species.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I must express my sincere thanks to Mr. Thomas Emerson,\r\nsuperintendent of schools in Newton, for the very kind interest he has\r\nshown in my work, in discussing its plan with me at the outset, in\r\nreading the completed manuscript, and in offering valuable criticisms.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE, _August_ 5, 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTAXATION AND GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\"Too much taxes\".\r\n\r\nWhat is taxation?\r\n\r\nTaxation and eminent domain.\r\n\r\nWhat is government?\r\n\r\nThe \"ship of state\".\r\n\r\n\"The government\".\r\n\r\nWhatever else it may be, \"the government\" is the power which imposes\r\ntaxes.\r\n\r\nDifference between taxation and robbery.\r\n\r\nSometimes taxation is robbery.\r\n\r\nThe study of history is full of practical lessons, and helpful to\r\nthose who would be good citizens.\r\n\r\nPerpetual vigilance is the price of liberty.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS AND DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE TOWNSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1. _The New England Township_.\r\n\r\nThe most ancient and simple form of government.\r\n\r\nNew England settled by church congregations.\r\n\r\nPolicy of the early Massachusetts government as to land grants.\r\n\r\nSmallness of the farms\r\n\r\nTownship and village\r\n\r\nSocial position of the settlers\r\n\r\nThe town-meeting\r\n\r\nSelectmen;

Arrows whiz,\r\ncatapults hurl their ponderous stones, wooden towers are built, secret\r\nmines are exploded. The sturdy citizens, led by a tall knight who seems\r\nto bear a charmed life, baffle every device of the besiegers. At length\r\nthe citizens capture the brother of the duke's general, and the\r\nbesiegers capture the tall knight, who turns out to be no knight after\r\nall, but just a plebeian hosier. The duke's general is on the point of\r\nordering the tradesman who has made so much trouble to be shot, but the\r\nlatter still remains master of the situation; for, as he dryly observes,\r\nif any harm comes to him, the enraged citizens will hang the general's\r\nbrother. Some parley ensues, in which the shrewd hosier promises for the\r\ntownsfolk to set free their prisoner and pay a round sum of money if the\r\nbesieging army will depart and leave them in peace. The offer is\r\naccepted, and so the matter is amicably settled. As the worthy citizen\r\nis about to take his leave, the general ventures a word of inquiry as to\r\nthe cause of the town's revolt. \"What, then, is your grievance, my good\r\nfriend?\" Our hosier knight, though deft with needle and keen with lance,\r\nhas a stammering tongue. He answers: \"Tuta--tuta--tuta--tuta--too much\r\ntaxes!\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Too much taxes.\"]\r\n\"Too much taxes:\" those three little words furnish us with a clue\r\nwherewith to understand and explain a great deal of history. A great\r\nmany sieges of towns, so horrid to have endured though so picturesque\r\nto read about, hundreds of weary marches and deadly battles, thousands\r\nof romantic plots that have led their inventors to the scaffold, have\r\nowed their origin to questions of taxation. The issue between the\r\nducal commander and the warlike tradesman has been tried over and\r\nover again in every country and in every age, and not always has the\r\noppressor been so speedily thwarted and got rid of. The questions as\r\nto how much the taxes shall be, and who is to decide how much they\r\nshall be, are always and in every stage of society questions of most\r\nfundamental importance. And ever since men began to make history, a\r\nvery large part of what they have done, in the way of making history,\r\nhas been the attempt to settle these questions, whether by discussion\r\nor by blows, whether in council chambers or on the battlefield. The\r\nFrench Revolution of 1789, the most terrible political convulsion of\r\nmodern times, was caused chiefly by \"too much taxes,\" and by the fact\r\nthat the people who paid the taxes were not the people who decided\r\nwhat the taxes were to be. Our own Revolution, which made the United\r\nStates a nation independent of Great Britain, was brought on by the\r\ndisputed question as to who was to decide what taxes American citizens\r\nmust pay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What is taxation?]\r\nWhat, then, are taxes? The question is one which is apt to come up,\r\nsooner or later, to puzzle children. They find no difficulty in\r\nunderstanding the butcher's bill for so many pounds of meat, or the\r\ntailor's bill for so many suits of clothes, where the value received\r\nis something that can be seen and handled. But the tax bill, though\r\nit comes as inevitably as the autumnal frosts, bears no such obvious\r\nrelation to the incidents of domestic life; it is not quite so clear\r\nwhat the money goes for; and hence it is apt to be paid by the head\r\nof the household with more or less grumbling, while for the younger\r\nmembers of the family it requires some explanation.\r\n\r\nIt only needs to be pointed out, however, that in every town some\r\nthings are done for the benefit of all the inhabitants of the town,\r\nthings which concern one person just as much as another. Thus roads\r\nare made and kept in repair, school-houses are built and salaries paid\r\nto school-teachers, there are constables who take criminals to jail,\r\nthere are engines for putting out fires, there are public libraries,\r\ntown cemeteries, and poor-houses. Money raised for these purposes,\r\nwhich are supposed to concern all the inhabitants, is supposed to be\r\npaid by all the inhabitants, each one furnishing his share; and the\r\nshare which each one pays is his town tax.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taxation and eminent domain.]\r\nFrom this illustration it would appear that taxes are private property\r\ntaken for public purposes; and in making this statement we come\r\nvery near the truth. Taxes are portions of private property which a\r\ngovernment takes for its public purposes. Before going farther, let\r\nus pause to observe that there is one other way, besides taxation, in\r\nwhich government sometimes takes private property for public purposes.\r\nRoads and streets are of great importance to the general public; and\r\nthe government of the town or city in which you live may see fit, in\r\nopening a new street, to run it across your garden, or to make you\r\nmove your house or shop out of the way for it. In so doing, the\r\ngovernment either takes away or damages some of your property. It\r\nexercises rights over your property without asking your permission.\r\nThis power of government over private property is called \"the right of\r\neminent domain.\" It means that a man's private interests must not be\r\nallowed to obstruct the interests of the whole community in which\r\nhe lives. But in two ways the exercise of eminent domain is unlike\r\ntaxation. In the first place, it is only occasional, and affects only\r\ncertain persons here or there, whereas taxation goes on perpetually\r\nand affects all persons who own property. In the second place, when\r\nthe government takes away a piece of your land to make a road, it pays\r\nyou money in return for it; perhaps not quite so much as you believe\r\nthe piece of land was worth in the market; the average human nature is\r\ndoubtless such that men seldom give fair measure for measure unless\r\nthey feel compelled to, and it is not easy to put a government under\r\ncompulsion. Still it gives you something; it does not ask you to part\r\nwith your property for nothing. Now in the case of taxation, the\r\ngovernment takes your money and seems to make no return to you\r\nindividually; but it is supposed to return to you the value of it in\r\nthe shape of well-paved streets, good schools, efficient protection\r\nagainst criminals, and so forth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: What is government?]\r\nIn giving this brief preliminary definition of taxes and taxation, we\r\nhave already begun to speak of \"the government\" of the town or city\r\nin which you live. We shall presently have to speak of other\r\n\"governments,\"--as the government of your state and the government of\r\nthe United States; and we shall now and then have occasion to allude\r\nto the governments of other countries in which the people are free,\r\nas, for example, England; and of some countries in which the people\r\nare not free, as, for example, Russia. It is desirable, therefore,\r\nthat we should here at the start make sure what we mean by\r\n\"government,\" in order that we may have a clear idea of what we are\r\ntalking about.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"ship of state.\"]\r\nOur verb \"to govern\" is an Old French word, one of the great host of\r\nFrench words which became a part of the English language between the\r\neleventh and fourteenth centuries, when so much French was spoken in\r\nEngland. The French word was _gouverner_, and its oldest form was\r\nthe Latin _gubernare_, a word which the Romans borrowed from\r\nthe Greek, and meant originally \"to steer the ship.\" Hence it very\r\nnaturally came to mean \"to guide,\" \"to direct,\" \"to command.\" The\r\ncomparison between governing and steering was a happy one. To govern\r\nis not to command as a master commands a slave, but it is to issue\r\norders and give directions for the common good; for the interests of\r\nthe man at the helm are the same as those of the people in the ship.\r\nAll must float or sink together. Hence we sometimes speak of the \"ship\r\nof state,\" and we often call the state a \"commonwealth,\" or something\r\nin the weal or welfare of which all the people are alike interested.\r\n\r\nGovernment, then, is the directing or managing of such affairs as\r\nconcern all the people alike,--as, for example, the punishment of\r\ncriminals, the enforcement of contracts, the defence against foreign\r\nenemies, the maintenance of roads and bridges, and so on. To the\r\ndirecting or managing of such affairs all the people are expected to\r\ncontribute, each according to his ability, in the shape of taxes.\r\nGovernment is something which is supported by the people and kept\r\nalive by taxation. There is no other way of keeping it alive.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"The government.\"]\r\nThe business of carrying on government--of steering the ship of\r\nstate--either requires some special training, or absorbs all the\r\ntime and attention of those who carry it on; and accordingly, in all\r\ncountries, certain persons or groups of persons are selected or in\r\nsome way set apart, for longer or shorter periods of time, to perform\r\nthe work of government. Such persons may be a king with his council,\r\nas in the England of the twelfth century; or a parliament led by a\r\nresponsible ministry, as in the England of to-day; or a president\r\nand two houses of congress, as in the United States; or a board of\r\nselectmen, as in a New England town. When we speak of \"a government\"\r\nor \"the government,\" we often mean the group of persons thus set\r\napart for carrying on the work of government. Thus, by \"the Gladstone\r\ngovernment\" we mean Mr. Gladstone, with his colleagues in the cabinet\r\nand his Liberal majority in the House of Commons; and by \"the Lincoln\r\ngovernment,\" properly speaking, was meant President Lincoln, with the\r\nRepublican majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Whatever else it may be, \"the government\" is the power which\r\ntaxes]\r\n\"The government\" has always many things to do, and there are many\r\ndifferent lights in which we might regard it. But for the present\r\nthere is one thing which we need especially to keep in mind. \"The\r\ngovernment\" is the power which can rightfully take away a part of your\r\nproperty, in the shape of taxes, to be used for public purposes. A\r\ngovernment is not worthy of the name, and cannot long be kept in\r\nexistence, unless it can raise money by taxation, and use force, if\r\nnecessary, in collecting its taxes. The only general government of the\r\nUnited States during the Revolutionary War, and for six years after\r\nits close, was the Continental Congress, which had no authority to\r\nraise money by taxation. In order to feed and clothe the army and pay\r\nits officers and soldiers, it was obliged to _ask_ for money from\r\nthe several states, and hardly ever got as much as was needed. It was\r\nobliged to borrow millions of dollars from France and Holland, and to\r\nissue promissory notes which soon became worthless. After the war was\r\nover it became clear that this so-called government could neither\r\npreserve order nor pay its debts, and accordingly it ceased to be\r\nrespected either at home or abroad, and it became necessary for the\r\nAmerican people to adopt a new form of government. Between the old\r\nContinental Congress and the government under which we have lived\r\nsince 1789, the differences were many; but by far the most essential\r\ndifference was that the new government could raise money by taxation,\r\nand was thus enabled properly to carry on the work of governing.\r\n\r\nIf we are in any doubt as to what is really the government of some\r\nparticular country, we cannot do better than observe what person or\r\npersons in that country are clothed with authority to tax the people.\r\nMere names, as customarily applied to governments, are apt to be\r\ndeceptive. Thus in the middle of the eighteenth century France and\r\nEngland were both called \"kingdoms;\" but so far as kingly power was\r\nconcerned, Louis XV. was a very different sort of a king from George\r\nII. The French king could impose taxes on his people, and it might\r\ntherefore be truly said that the government of France was in the king.\r\nIndeed, it was Louis XV's immediate predecessor who made the famous\r\nremark, \"The state is myself.\" But the English king could not impose\r\ntaxes; the only power in England that could do that was the House of\r\nCommons, and accordingly it is correct to say that in England, at the\r\ntime of which we are speaking, the government was (as it still is) in\r\nthe House of Commons.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difference between taxation and robbery.]\r\nI say, then, the most essential feature of a government--or at any\r\nrate the feature with which it is most important for us to become\r\nfamiliar at the start--is its power of taxation. The government is\r\nthat which taxes. If individuals take away some of your property for\r\npurposes of their own, it is robbery; you lose your money and get\r\nnothing in return. But if the government takes away some of your\r\nproperty in the shape of taxes, it is supposed to render to you an\r\nequivalent in the shape of good government, something without which\r\nour lives and property would not be safe. Herein seems to lie the\r\ndifference between taxation and robbery. When the highwayman points\r\nhis pistol at me and I hand him my purse and watch, I am robbed. But\r\nwhen I pay the tax-collector, who can seize my watch or sell my house\r\nover my head if I refuse, I am simply paying what is fairly due from\r\nme toward supporting the government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Sometimes taxation _is_ robbery.]\r\nIn what we have been saying it has thus far been assumed that the\r\ngovernment is in the hands of upright and competent men and is\r\nproperly administered. It is now time to observe that robbery may be\r\ncommitted by governments as well as by individuals. If the business of\r\ngoverning is placed in the hands of men who have an imperfect sense of\r\ntheir duty toward the public, if such men raise money by taxation and\r\nthen spend it on their own pleasures, or to increase their political\r\ninfluence, or for other illegitimate purposes, it is really robbery,\r\njust as much as if these men were to stand with pistols by the\r\nroadside and empty the wallets of people passing by. They make a\r\ndishonest use of their high position as members of government, and\r\nextort money for which they make no return in the shape of services\r\nto the public. History is full of such lamentable instances of\r\nmisgovernment, and one of the most important uses of the study of\r\nhistory is to teach us how they have occurred, in order that we may\r\nlearn how to avoid them, as far as possible, in the future.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The study of history.]\r\nWhen we begin in childhood the study of history we are attracted\r\nchiefly by anecdotes of heroes and their battles, kings and their\r\ncourts, how the Spartans fought at Thermopylae, how Alfred let the\r\ncakes burn, how Henry VIII. beheaded his wives, how Louis XIV. used to\r\nlive at Versailles. It is quite right that we should be interested in\r\nsuch personal details, the more so the better; for history has been\r\nmade by individual men and women, and until we have understood the\r\ncharacter of a great many of those who have gone before us, and how\r\nthey thought and felt in their time, we have hardly made a fair\r\nbeginning in the study of history. The greatest historians, such as\r\nFreeman and Mommsen, show as lively an interest in persons as in\r\nprinciples; and I would not give much for the historical theories of a\r\nman who should declare himself indifferent to little personal details.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It is full of practical lessons;]\r\nSome people, however, never outgrow the child's notion of history\r\nas merely a mass of pretty anecdotes or stupid annals, without any\r\npractical bearing upon our own every-day life. There could not be a\r\ngreater mistake. Very little has happened in the past which has not\r\nsome immediate practical lessons for us; and when we study history\r\nin order to profit by the experience of our ancestors, to find out\r\nwherein they succeeded and wherein they failed, in order that we may\r\nemulate their success and avoid their errors, then history becomes the\r\nnoblest and most valuable of studies. It then becomes, moreover, an\r\narduous pursuit, at once oppressive and fascinating from its endless\r\nwealth of material, and abounding in problems which the most diligent\r\nstudent can never hope completely to solve.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and helpful to those who would be good citizens.]\r\n[Sidenote: Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.]\r\nFew people have the leisure to undertake a systematic and thorough\r\nstudy of history, but every one ought to find time to learn the\r\nprincipal features of the governments under which we live, and to get\r\nsome inkling of the way in which these governments have come into\r\nexistence and of the causes which have made them what they are. Some\r\nsuch knowledge is necessary to the proper discharge of the duties of\r\ncitizenship. Political questions, great and small, are perpetually\r\narising, to be discussed in the newspapers and voted on at the polls;\r\nand it is the duty of every man and woman, young or old, to try to\r\nunderstand them. That is a duty which we owe, each and all of us, to\r\nourselves and to our fellow-countrymen. For if such questions are\r\nnot settled in accordance with knowledge, they will be settled in\r\naccordance with ignorance; and that is a kind of settlement likely\r\nto be fraught with results disastrous to everybody. It cannot be too\r\noften repeated that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\r\nPeople sometimes argue as if they supposed that because our national\r\ngovernment is called a republic and not a monarchy, and because we\r\nhave free schools and universal suffrage, therefore our liberties are\r\nforever secure. Our government is, indeed, in most respects, a marvel\r\nof political skill; and in ordinary times it runs so smoothly that now\r\nand then, absorbed as most of us are in domestic cares, we are apt to\r\nforget that it will not run of itself. To insure that the government\r\nof the nation or the state, of the city or the township, shall\r\nbe properly administered, requires from every citizen the utmost\r\nwatchfulness and intelligence of which he is capable.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the teacher_. Encourage full answers. Do not permit anything\r\nlike committing the text to memory. In the long run the pupil who\r\nrelies upon his own language, however inferior it may be to that of\r\nthe text, is better off. Naturally, with thoughtful study, the pupil's\r\nlanguage will feel the influence of that of the text, and so improve.\r\nThe important thing in any answer is the fundamental thought. This\r\nidea once grasped, the expression of it may receive some attention.\r\nThe expression will often be broken and faulty, partly because of\r\nthe immaturity of the pupil, and partly because of the newness and\r\ndifficulty of the theme. Do not let the endeavour to secure excellent\r\nexpression check a certain freedom and spontaneity that should be\r\nencouraged in the pupil. When the teacher desires to place special\r\nstress on excellent presentation, it is wise to assign topics\r\nbeforehand, so that each pupil may know definitely what is expected of\r\nhim, and prepare himself accordingly.\r\n\r\n1. Tell the story that introduces the chapter.\r\n\r\n2. What lesson is it designed to teach?\r\n\r\n3. What caused the French Revolution?\r\n\r\n4. What caused the American Revolution?\r\n\r\n5. Compare the tax bill with that of the butcher or tailor.\r\n\r\n6. What are taxes raised for in a town? For whose benefit?\r\n\r\n7. Define taxes.\r\n\r\n8. Define the right of eminent domain.\r\n\r\n9. Distinguish between taxes and the right of eminent domain.\r\n\r\n10. What is the origin of the word \"govern\"?\r\n\r\n11. Define government.\r\n\r\n12. By whom is it supported, how is it kept alive, and by whom is it\r\ncarried on?\r\n\r\n13. Give illustrations of governments.\r\n\r\n14. What one power must government have to be worthy of the name?\r\n\r\n15. What was the principal weakness of the government during the\r\nAmerican Revolution?\r\n\r\n\r\n16. Compare this government with that of the United States since 1789.\r\n\r\n17. If it is doubtful what the real government of a country is, how\r\nmay the doubt be settled?\r\n\r\n18. Illustrate by reference to France and England in the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n19. What is the difference between taxation and robbery?\r\n\r\n20. Under what conditions may taxation become robbery?\r\n\r\n21. To what are we easily attracted in our first study of history?\r\n\r\n22. What ought to be learned from history?\r\n\r\n23. What sort of knowledge is helpful in discharging the duties of\r\ncitizenship?\r\n\r\n24. Show how \"eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS AND DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\n_To the teacher_. The object of this series of questions and\r\nsuggestions is to stimulate reading, investigating, and thinking. It\r\nis not expected, indeed it is hardly possible, that each pupil shall\r\nrespond to them all. A single question may cost prolonged study.\r\nAssign the numbers, therefore, to individuals to report upon at a\r\nsubsequent recitation,--one or more to each pupil, according to the\r\ndifficulty of the numbers. Reserve some for class consideration or\r\ndiscussion. Now and then let the teacher answer a question himself,\r\npartly to furnish the pupils with good examples of answers, and partly\r\nto insure attention to matters that might otherwise escape notice.\r\n\r\n1. Are there people who receive no benefit from their payment of\r\ntaxes?\r\n\r\n2. Are the benefits received by people in proportion to the amounts\r\npaid by them?\r\n\r\n3. Show somewhat fully what taxes had to do with the French\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n4. Show somewhat fully what taxes had to do with the American\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\n5. Give illustrations of the exercise of the right of eminent domain\r\nin your own town or county or state.\r\n\r\n6. Do railroad corporations exercise such a right? How do they succeed\r\nin getting land for their tracks?\r\n\r\n7. In case of disagreement, how is a fair price determined for\r\nproperty taken by eminent domain?\r\n\r\n8. What persons are prominent to-day in the government of your own\r\ntown or city? Of your own county? Of your own state? Of the United\r\nStates?\r\n\r\n9. Who constitute the government of the school to which you belong?\r\nDoes this question admit of more than one answer? Has the government\r\nof your school any power to tax the people to support the school?\r\n\r\n10. What is the difference between a state and the government of a\r\nstate?\r\n\r\n11. Which is the more powerful branch of the English Parliament? Why?\r\n\r\n12. Is it a misuse of the funds of a city to provide entertainments\r\nfor the people July 4? To expend money in entertaining distinguished\r\nguests? To provide flowers, carriages, cigars, wines, etc., for such\r\nguests?\r\n\r\n13. What is meant by subordinating public office to private ends? Cite\r\ninstances from history.\r\n\r\n14. What histories have you read? What one of them, if any, would you\r\ncall a \"child's history,\" or a \"drum and trumpet\" history? What one of\r\nthem, if any, has impressed any lessons upon you?\r\n\r\n15. Mention some principles that history has taught you.\r\n\r\n16. Mention a few offices, and tell the sort of intelligence that is\r\nneeded by the persons who hold them. What results might follow if such\r\nintelligence were lacking?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.\r\n\r\nIt is designed in the bibliographical notes to indicate some\r\nauthorities to which reference may be made for greater detail than is\r\npossible in an elementary work like the present. It is believed\r\nthat the notes will prove a help to teacher and pupil in special\r\ninvestigations, and to the reader who may wish to make selections from\r\nexcellent sources for purposes of self-culture. It is hardly necessary\r\nto add that it is sometimes worth much to the student to know where\r\nvaluable information may be obtained, even when it is not practicable\r\nto make immediate use of it.\r\n\r\nCertain books should always be at the teacher's desk during the\r\ninstruction in civil government, and as easily accessible as the large\r\ndictionary; as, for instance, the following: The General Statutes of the\r\nstate, the manual or blue-book of the state legislature, and, if the\r\nschool is in a city, the city charter and ordinances. It is also\r\ndesirable to add to this list the statutes of the United States and a\r\nmanual of Congress or of the general government. Manuals may be obtained\r\nthrough representatives in the state legislature and in Congress. They\r\nwill answer nearly every purpose if they are not of the latest issue.\r\nThe _Statesman's Year Book_, published by Macmillan & Co., New York,\r\nevery year, is exceedingly valuable for reference. Certain almanacs,\r\nparticularly the comprehensive ones issued by the New York _Tribune_ and\r\nthe New York _World_, are rich in state and national statistics, and so\r\ninexpensive as to be within everybody's means.\r\n\r\nTAXATION AND GOVERNMENT.--As to the causes of the American revolution,\r\nsee my _War of Independence_, Boston, 1889; and as to the weakness of\r\nthe government of the United States before 1789, see my _Critical Period\r\nof American History_, Boston, 1888. As to the causes of the French\r\nrevolution, see Paul Lacombe, _The Growth of a People_, N.Y., 1883, and\r\nthe third volume of Kitchin's _History of France_, London, 1887; also\r\nMorse Stephens, _The French Revolution_, vol. i., N.Y., 1887; Taine,\r\n_The Ancient Regime_,--N.Y., 1876, and _The Revolution_, 2 vols., N.Y.,\r\n1880. The student may read with pleasure and profit Dickens's _Tale of\r\nTwo Cities_. For the student familiar with French, an excellent book is\r\nAlbert Babeau, _Le Village sous l'ancien Régime_, Paris, 1879; see also\r\nTocqueville, _L'ancien Régime et la Révolution_, 7th ed., Paris, 1866.\r\nThere is a good sketch of the causes of the French revolution in the\r\nfifth volume of Leeky's _History of England in the Eighteenth Century_,\r\nN.Y., 1887; see also Buckle's _History of Civilization_, chaps,\r\nxii.-xiv. There is no better commentary on my first chapter than the\r\nlurid history of France in the eighteenth century. The strong contrast\r\nto English and American history shows us most instructively what we have\r\nthus far escaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE TOWNSHIP.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1. _The New England Township_.\r\n\r\nOf the various kinds of government to be found in the United States,\r\nwe may begin by considering that of the New England township. As\r\nwe shall presently see, it is in principle of all known forms of\r\ngovernment the oldest as well as the simplest. Let us observe how the\r\nNew England township grew up.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New England was settled by church congregations.]\r\nWhen people from England first came to dwell in the wilderness of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, they settled in groups upon small irregular-shaped\r\npatches of land, which soon came to be known as townships. There were\r\nseveral reasons why they settled thus in small groups, instead of\r\nscattering about over the country and carving out broad estates for\r\nthemselves. In the first place, their principal reason for coming to\r\nNew England was their dissatisfaction with the way in which church\r\naffairs were managed in the old country. They wished to bring about a\r\nreform in the church, in such wise that the members of a congregation\r\nshould have more voice than formerly in the church-government, and\r\nthat the minister of each congregation should be more independent than\r\nformerly of the bishop and of the civil government. They also wished\r\nto abolish sundry rites and customs of the church of which they had\r\ncome to disapprove. Finding the resistance to their reforms quite\r\nformidable in England, and having some reason to fear that they might\r\nbe themselves crushed in the struggle, they crossed the ocean in order\r\nto carry out their ideas in a new and remote country where they might\r\nbe comparatively secure from interference. Hence it was quite natural\r\nthat they should come in congregations, led by their favourite\r\nministers,--such men, for example, as Higginson and Cotton, Hooker and\r\nDavenport. When such men, famous in England for their bold preaching\r\nand imperiled thereby, decided to move to America, a considerable\r\nnumber of their parishioners would decide to accompany them, and\r\nsimilarly minded members of neighbouring churches would leave their\r\nown pastor and join in the migration. Such a group of people, arriving\r\non the coast of Massachusetts, would naturally select some convenient\r\nlocality, where they might build their houses near together and all go\r\nto the same church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Land grants.]\r\nThis migration, therefore, was a movement, not of individuals or of\r\nseparate families, but of church-congregations, and it continued to be\r\nso as the settlers made their way inland and westward. The first\r\nriver towns of Connecticut were founded by congregations coming from\r\nDorchester, Cambridge, and Watertown. This kind of settlement was\r\nfavoured by the government of Massachusetts, which made grants of\r\nland, not to individuals but to companies of people who wished to live\r\ntogether and attend the same church.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the soil of New England was not favourable to the\r\ncultivation of great quantities of staple articles, such as rice\r\nor tobacco, so that there was nothing to tempt people to undertake\r\nextensive plantations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Small farms.]\r\nMost of the people lived on small farms, each family raising but\r\nlittle more than enough food for its own support; and the small size\r\nof the farms made it possible to have a good many in a compact\r\nneighbourhood. It appeared also that towns could be more easily\r\ndefended against the Indians than scattered plantations; and this\r\ndoubtless helped to keep people together, although if there had been\r\nany strong inducement for solitary pioneers to plunge into the great\r\nwoods, as in later years so often happened at the West, it is not\r\nlikely that any dread of the savages would have hindered them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Township and village.]\r\n[Sidenote: Social positions of settlers.]\r\nThus the early settlers of New England came to live in townships. A\r\ntownship would consist of about as many farms as could be disposed\r\nwithin convenient distance from the meeting-house, where all the\r\ninhabitants, young and old, gathered every Sunday, coming on horseback\r\nor afoot. The meeting-house was thus centrally situated, and near\r\nit was the town pasture or \"common,\" with the school-house and the\r\nblock-house, or rude fortress for defence against the Indians. For the\r\nlatter building some commanding position was apt to be selected, and\r\nhence we so often find the old village streets of New England running\r\nalong elevated ridges or climbing over beetling hilltops. Around the\r\nmeeting-house and common the dwellings gradually clustered into a\r\nvillage, and after a while the tavern, store, and town-house made\r\ntheir appearance.\r\n\r\nAmong the people who thus tilled the farms and built up the villages of\r\nNew England, the differences in what we should call social position,\r\nthough noticeable, were not extreme. While in England some had been\r\nesquires or country magistrates, or \"lords of the manor,\"--a phrase\r\nwhich does not mean a member of the peerage, but a landed proprietor\r\nwith dependent tenants[1]; some had been yeomen, or persons holding\r\nfarms by some free kind of tenure; some had been artisans or tradesmen\r\nin cities. All had for many generations been more or less accustomed to\r\nself-government and to public meetings for discussing local affairs.\r\nThat self-government, especially as far as church matters were\r\nconcerned, they were stoutly bent upon maintaining and extending.\r\nIndeed, that was what they had crossed the ocean for. Under these\r\ncircumstances they developed a kind of government which we may describe\r\nin the present tense, for its methods are pretty much the same to-day\r\nthat they were two centuries ago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Compare the Scottish \"laird.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The town-meeting.]\r\nIn a New England township the people directly govern themselves; the\r\ngovernment is the people, or, to speak with entire precision, it is\r\nall the male inhabitants of one-and-twenty years of age and upwards.\r\nThe people tax themselves. Once each year, usually in March but\r\nsometimes as early as February or as late as April, a \"town-meeting\"\r\nis held, at which all the grown men of the township are expected to be\r\npresent and to vote, while any one may introduce motions or take part\r\nin the discussion. In early times there was a fine for non-attendance,\r\nbut at is no longer the case; it is supposed that a due regard to his\r\nown interests will induce every man to come.\r\n\r\nThe town-meeting is held in the town-house, but at first it used to be\r\nheld in the church, which was thus a \"meeting-house\" for civil as well\r\nas ecclesiastical purposes. At the town-meeting measures relating\r\nto the administration of town affairs are discussed and adopted or\r\nrejected; appropriations are made for the public expenses of the\r\ntown, or in other words the amount of the town taxes for the year is\r\ndetermined; and town officers are elected for the year. Let us first\r\nenumerate these officers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Selectmen.]\r\nThe principal executive magistrates of the town are the selectmen.\r\nThey are three, five, seven, or nine in number, according to the size\r\nof the town and the amount of public business to be transacted. The\r\nodd number insures a majority decision in case of any difference of\r\nopinion among them. They have the general management of the public\r\nbusiness. They issue warrants for the holding of town-meetings, and\r\nthey can call such a meeting at any time during the year when there\r\nseems to be need for it, but the warrant must always specify the\r\nsubjects which are to be discussed and acted on at the meeting. The\r\nselectmen also lay out highways, grant licenses, and impanel jurors;\r\nthey may act as health officers and issue orders regarding sewerage,\r\nthe abatement of nuisances, or the isolation of contagious diseases;\r\nin many cases they act as assessors of taxes, and as overseers of the\r\npoor. They are the proper persons to listen to complaints if anything\r\ngoes wrong in the town. In county matters and state matters they speak\r\nfor the town, and if it is a party to a law-suit they represent it in\r\ncourt; for the New England town is a legal corporation, and as such\r\ncan hold property, and sue and be sued. In a certain sense the\r\nselectmen may be said to be \"the government\" of the town during the\r\nintervals between the town-meetings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Town-clerk.]\r\nAn officer no less important than the selectmen is the town-clerk. He\r\nkeeps the record of all votes passed in the town-meetings. He also\r\nrecords the names of candidates and the number of votes for each in\r\nthe election of state and county officers. He records the births,\r\nmarriages, and deaths in the township, and issues certificates to\r\npersons who declare an intention of marriage. He likewise keeps on\r\nrecord accurate descriptions of the position and bounds of public\r\nroads; and, in short, has general charge of all matters of\r\ntown-record.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Town-treasurer.]\r\nEvery town has also its treasurer, who receives and takes care of the\r\nmoney coming in from the taxpayers, or whatever money belongs to the\r\ntown. Out of this money he pays the public expenses. He must keep a\r\nstrict account of his receipts and payments, and make a report of them\r\neach year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constables.]\r\nEvery town has one or more constables, who serve warrants from the\r\nselectmen and writs from the law courts. They pursue criminals and\r\ntake them to jail. They summon jurors. In many towns they serve as\r\ncollectors of taxes, but in many other towns a special officer is\r\nchosen for that purpose. When a person, fails to pay his taxes,\r\nafter a specified time the collector has authority to seize upon his\r\nproperty and sell it at auction, paying the tax and costs out of the\r\nproceeds of the sale, and handing over the balance to the owner. In\r\nsome cases, where no property can be found and there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the delinquent is not acting in good faith, he can be\r\narrested and kept in prison until the tax and costs are paid, or until\r\nhe is released by the proper legal methods.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Assessors of taxes and overseers of the poor.]\r\nWhere the duties of the selectmen are likely to be too numerous, the\r\ntown may choose three or more assessors of taxes to prepare the tax\r\nlists; and three or more overseers of the poor, to regulate the\r\nmanagement of the village almshouse and confer with other towns\r\nupon such questions as often arise concerning the settlement and\r\nmaintenance of homeless paupers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Public schools.]\r\nEvery town has its school committee. In 1647 the legislature of\r\nMassachusetts enacted a law with the following preamble: \"It being\r\none chief project of that old deluder, Satan, to keep men from the\r\nknowledge of the Scriptures, as in former times by keeping them in an\r\nunknown tongue, so in these latter times by persuading from the use of\r\ntongues, that so at least the true sense and meaning of the original\r\nmight be clouded and corrupted with false glosses of deceivers; to the\r\nend that learning may not be buried in the graves of our forefathers,\r\nin church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeavours;\" it was\r\ntherefore ordered that every township containing fifty families or\r\nhouseholders should forthwith set up a school in which children might\r\nbe taught to read and write, and that every township containing one\r\nhundred families or householders should set up a school in which\r\nboys might be fitted for entering Harvard College. Even before this\r\nstatute, several towns, as for instance Roxbury and Dedham, had begun\r\nto appropriate money for free schools; and these were the beginnings\r\nof a system of public education which has come to be adopted\r\nthroughout the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: School committees.]\r\nThe school committee exercises powers of such a character as to make\r\nit a body of great importance. The term of service of the members is\r\nthree years, one third being chosen annually. The number of members\r\nmust therefore be some multiple of three. The slow change in the\r\nmembership of the board insures that a large proportion of the members\r\nshall always be familiar with the duties of the place. The school\r\ncommittee must visit all the public schools at least once a month, and\r\nmake a report to the town every year. It is for them to decide what\r\ntext-books are to be used. They examine candidates for the position\r\nof teacher and issue certificates to those whom they select. The\r\ncertificate is issued in duplicate, and one copy is handed to the\r\nselectmen as a warrant that the teacher is entitled to receive a\r\nsalary. Teachers are appointed for a term of one year, but where their\r\nwork is satisfactory the appointments are usually renewed year after\r\nyear. A recent act in Massachusetts _permits_ the appointment of\r\nteachers to serve during good behaviour, but few boards have as yet\r\navailed themselves of this law. If the amount of work to be done seems\r\nto require it, the committee appoints a superintendent of schools. He\r\nis a sort of lieutenant of the school committee, and under its general\r\ndirection carries on the detailed work of supervision.\r\n\r\nOther town officers are the surveyors of highways, who are responsible\r\nfor keeping the roads and bridges in repair; field-drivers and\r\npound-keepers; fence-viewers; surveyors of lumber, measurers of wood,\r\nand sealers of weights and measures.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Field-drivers and pound keepers.]\r\nThe field-driver takes stray animals to the pound, and then notifies\r\ntheir owner; or if he does not know who is the owner he posts a\r\ndescription of the animals in some such place as the village store\r\nor tavern, or has it published in the nearest country newspaper.\r\nMeanwhile the strays are duly fed by the pound-keeper, who does not\r\nlet them out of his custody until all expenses have been paid.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fence-viewers.]\r\nIf the owners of contiguous farms, gardens, or fields get into a\r\ndispute about their partition fences or walls, they may apply to\r\none of the fence-viewers, of whom each town has at least two. The\r\nfence-viewer decides the matter, and charges a small fee for his\r\nservices. Where it is necessary he may order suitable walls or fences\r\nto be built.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other officers.]\r\nThe surveyors of lumber measure and mark lumber offered for sale.\r\nThe measurers of wood do the same for firewood. The sealers test the\r\ncorrectness of weights and measures used in trade, and tradesmen\r\nare not allowed to use weights and measures that have not been thus\r\nofficially examined and sealed. Measurers and sealers may be appointed\r\nby the selectmen.\r\n\r\nSuch are the officers always to be found in the Massachusetts town,\r\nexcept where the duties of some of them are discharged by the\r\nselectmen. Of these officers, the selectmen, town-clerk, treasurer,\r\nconstable, school committee, and assessors must be elected by ballot\r\nat the annual town-meeting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Calling the town-meeting.]\r\nWhen this meeting is to be called the selectmen issue a warrant for\r\nthe purpose, specifying the time and place of meeting and the nature\r\nof the business to be transacted. The constable posts copies of the\r\nwarrant in divers conspicuous places not less than a week before the\r\ntime appointed. Then, after making a note upon the warrant that he has\r\nduly served it, he hands it over to the town-clerk. On the appointed\r\nday, when the people have assembled, the town-clerk calls the meeting\r\nto order and reads the warrant. The meeting then proceeds to choose by\r\nballot its presiding officer, or \"moderator,\" and business goes on\r\nin accordance with parliamentary customs pretty generally recognized\r\namong all people who speak English.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Town, country, and state taxes.]\r\nAt this meeting the amount of money to be raised by taxation for town\r\npurposes is determined. But, as we shall see, every inhabitant of a\r\ntown lives not only under a town government, but also under a county\r\ngovernment and a state government, and all these governments have to\r\nbe supported by taxation. In Massachusetts the state and the county\r\nmake use of the machinery of the town government in order to assess\r\nand collect their taxes. The total amounts to be raised are equitably\r\ndivided among the several towns and cities, so that each town pays its\r\nproportionate share. Each year, therefore, the town assessors know\r\nthat a certain amount of money must be raised from the taxpayers of\r\ntheir town,--partly for the town, partly for the county, partly for\r\nthe state,--and for the general convenience they usually assess it\r\nupon the taxpayers all at once. The amounts raised for the state and\r\ncounty are usually very much smaller than the amount raised for\r\nthe town. As these amounts are all raised in the town and by town\r\nofficers, we shall find it convenient to sum up in this place what we\r\nhave to say about the way in which taxes are raised. Bear in mind that\r\nwe are still considering the New England system, and our illustration\r\nis taken from the practice in Massachusetts. But the general\r\nprinciples of taxation are so similar in the different states that,\r\nalthough we may now and then have to point to differences of detail,\r\nwe shall not need to go over the whole subject again. We have now to\r\nobserve how and upon whom the taxes are assessed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Poll-tax.]\r\nThey are assessed partly upon persons, but chiefly upon property, and\r\nproperty is divisible into real estate and personal estate. The tax\r\nassessed upon persons is called the poll-tax, and cannot exceed the\r\nsum of two dollars upon every male citizen over twenty years old. In\r\ncases of extreme poverty the assessors may remit the poll-tax.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Real-estate taxes.]\r\nAs to real estate, there are in every town some lands and buildings\r\nwhich, for reasons of public policy, are exempted from paying taxes;\r\nas, for example, churches, graveyards, and tombs; many charitable\r\ninstitutions, including universities and colleges; and public\r\nbuildings which belong to the state or to the United States. All lands\r\nand buildings, except such as are exempt by law, must pay taxes.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Taxes on personal property.]\r\nPersonal property includes pretty much everything that one can own\r\nexcept lands and buildings,--pretty much everything that can be moved\r\nor carried about from one place to another. It thus includes ready\r\nmoney, stocks and bonds, ships and wagons, furniture, pictures, and\r\nbooks. It also includes the amount of debts due to a person in excess\r\nof the amount that he owes; also the income from his employment,\r\nwhether in the shape of profits from business or a fixed salary.\r\n\r\nSome personal property is exempted from taxation; as, for example,\r\nhousehold furniture to the amount of $1,000 in value, and income\r\nfrom employment to the extent of $2,000. The obvious intent of this\r\nexemption is to prevent taxation from bearing too hard upon persons\r\nof small means; and for a similar reason the tools of farmers and\r\nmechanics are exempted.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: United States bonds are also especially exempted from\r\ntaxation.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: When and where taxes are assessed.]\r\nThe date at which property is annually reckoned for assessment is in\r\nMassachusetts the first day of May. The poll-tax is assessed upon each\r\nperson in the town or city where he has his legal habitation on that\r\nday; and as a general rule the taxes upon his personal property are\r\nassessed to him in the same place. But taxes upon lands or buildings\r\nare assessed in the city or town where they are situated, and to the\r\nperson, wherever he lives, who is the owner of them on the first day\r\nof May. Thus a man who lives in the Berkshire mountains, say for\r\nexample in the town of Lanesborough, will pay his poll-tax to that\r\ntown. For his personal property, whether it he bonds of a railroad in\r\nColorado, or shares in a bank in New York, or costly pictures in his\r\nhouse at Lanesborough, he will likewise pay taxes to Lanesborough. So\r\nfor the house in which he lives, and the land upon which it stands, he\r\npays taxes to that same town. But if he owns at the same time a house\r\nin Boston, he pays taxes for it to Boston, and if he owns a block of\r\nshops in Chicago he pays taxes for the same to Chicago. It is very apt\r\nto be the case that the rate of taxation is higher in large cities\r\nthan in villages; and accordingly it often happens that wealthy\r\ninhabitants of cities, who own houses in some country town, move into\r\nthem before the first of May, and otherwise comport themselves as\r\nlegal residents of the country town, in order that their personal\r\nproperty may be assessed there rather than in the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tax lists.]\r\nAbout the first of May the assessors call upon the inhabitants of\r\ntheir town to render a true statement as to their property. The most\r\napproved form is for the assessors to send by mail to each taxable\r\ninhabitant a printed list of questions, with blank spaces which he is\r\nto fill with written answers. The questions relate to every kind\r\nof property, and when the person addressed returns the list to the\r\nassessors he must make oath that to the best of his knowledge and\r\nbelief his answers are true. He thus becomes liable to the penalties\r\nfor perjury if he can be proved to have sworn falsely. A reasonable\r\ntime--usually six or eight weeks--is allowed for the list to be\r\nreturned to the assessors. If any one fails to return his list by the\r\nspecified time, the assessors must make their own estimate of the\r\nprobable amount of his property. If their estimate is too high, he may\r\npetition the assessors to have the error corrected, but in many cases\r\nit may prove troublesome to effect this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Cheating the government.]\r\nObserve here an important difference between the imposition of taxes\r\nupon real estate and upon personal property. Houses and lands cannot\r\nrun away or be tucked out of sight. Their value, too, is something\r\nof which the assessors can very likely judge as well as the owner.\r\nDeception is therefore extremely difficult, and taxation for real\r\nestate is pretty fairly distributed among the different owners. With\r\nregard to personal estate it is very different. It is comparatively\r\neasy to conceal one's ownership of some kinds of personal property, or\r\nto understate one's income. Hence the temptation to lessen the burden\r\nof the tax bill by making false statements is considerable, and\r\ndoubtless a good deal of deception is practised. There are many people\r\nwho are too honest to cheat individuals, but still consider it a\r\nvenial sin to cheat the government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rate of taxation.]\r\nAfter the assessors have obtained all their returns they can calculate\r\nthe total value of the taxable property in the town; and knowing the\r\namount of the tax to be raised, it is easy to calculate the rate at\r\nwhich the tax is to be assessed. In most parts of the United States a\r\nrate of one and a half per cent, or $15 tax on each $1,000 worth of\r\nproperty, would be regarded as moderate; three per cent would be\r\nregarded as excessively high. At the lower of these rates a man worth\r\n$50,000 would pay $750 for his yearly taxes. The annual income of\r\n$50,000, invested on good security, is hardly more than $2,500.\r\nObviously $750 is a large sum to subtract from such an income.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Undervaluation.]\r\n[Sidenote: The burden of taxation.]\r\nIn point of fact, however, the tax is seldom quite as heavy as\r\nthis. It is not easy to tell exactly how much a man is worth, and\r\naccordingly assessors, not wishing to be too disagreeable in the\r\ndischarge of their duties, have naturally fallen into a way of giving\r\nthe lower valuation the benefit of the doubt, until in many places a\r\ncustom has grown up of regularly undervaluing property for purposes of\r\ntaxation. Very much as liquid measures have gradually shrunk until\r\nit takes five quart bottles to hold a gallon, so there has been a\r\nshrinkage of valuations until it has become common to tax a man for\r\nonly three fourths or perhaps two thirds of what his property is\r\nworth in the market. This makes the rate higher, to be sure, but\r\nthe individual taxpayer nevertheless seems to feel relieved by it.\r\nAllowing for this undervaluation, we may say that a man worth $50,000\r\ncommonly pays not less than $500 for his yearly taxes, or about one\r\nfifth of the annual income of the property. We thus begin to see what\r\na heavy burden taxes are, and how essential to good government it is\r\nthat citizens should know what their money goes for, and should be\r\nable to exert some effective control over the public expenditures.\r\nWhere the rate of taxation in a town rises to a very high point, such\r\nas two and a half or three per cent, the prosperity of the town is apt\r\nto be seriously crippled. Traders and manufacturers move away to other\r\ntowns, or those who would otherwise come to the town in question stay\r\naway, because they cannot afford to use up all their profits in paying\r\ntaxes. If such a state of things is long kept up, the spirit of\r\nenterprise is weakened, the place shows signs of untidiness and want\r\nof thrift, and neighbouring towns, once perhaps far behind it in\r\ngrowth, by and by shoot ahead of it and take away its business.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"magic fund\" delusion.]\r\nWithin its proper sphere, government by town-meeting is the form of\r\ngovernment most effectively under watch and control. Everything is\r\ndone in the full daylight of publicity. The specific objects for which\r\npublic money is to be appropriated are discussed in the presence of\r\neverybody, and any one who disapproves of any of these objects, or of\r\nthe way in which it is proposed to obtain it, has an opportunity to\r\ndeclare his opinions. Under this form of government people are not\r\nso liable to bewildering delusions as under other forms. I refer\r\nespecially to the delusion that \"the Government\" is a sort of\r\nmysterious power, possessed of a magic inexhaustible fund of wealth,\r\nand able to do all manner of things for the benefit of \"the People.\"\r\nSome such notion as this, more often implied than expressed, is very\r\ncommon, and it is inexpressibly dear to demagogues. It is the prolific\r\nroot from which springs that luxuriant crop of humbug upon which\r\npolitical tricksters thrive as pigs fatten upon corn. In point of\r\nfact no such government, armed with a magic fund of its own, has ever\r\nexisted upon the earth. No government has ever yet used any money\r\nfor public purposes which it did not first take from its own\r\npeople,--unless when it may have plundered it from some other people\r\nin victorious warfare.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitant of a New England town is perpetually reminded that \"the\r\nGovernment\" is \"the People.\" Although he may think loosely about\r\nthe government of his state or the still more remote government at\r\nWashington, he is kept pretty close to the facts where local affairs\r\nare concerned, and in this there is a political training of no small\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Educational value of the town-meeting.]\r\nIn the kind of discussion which it provokes, in the necessity of facing\r\nargument with argument and of keeping one's temper under control, the\r\ntown-meeting is the best political training school in existence. Its\r\neducational value is far higher than that of the newspaper, which, in\r\nspite of its many merits as a diffuser of information, is very apt to do\r\nits best to bemuddle and sophisticate plain facts. The period when\r\ntown-meetings ware most important from the wide scope of their\r\ntransactions was the period of earnest and sometimes stormy discussion\r\nthat ushered in our Revolutionary war. Country towns were then of more\r\nimportance relatively than now; one country town--Boston--was at the\r\nsame time a great political centre; and its meetings were presided over\r\nand addressed by men of commanding ability, among whom Samuel Adams,\r\n\"the man of the town-meeting,\" was foremost[3]. In those days\r\ngreat principles of government were discussed with a wealth of knowledge\r\nand stated with masterly skill in town-meeting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The phrase is Professor Hosmer's: see his _Samuel Adams, the\r\nMan of the Town Meeting_, in \"Johns Hopkins Univ. Studies,\" vol. II. no.\r\niv.; also his _Samuel Adams_, in \"American Statesmen\" series; Boston,\r\n1885.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: By-laws.]\r\nThe town-meeting is to a very limited extent a legislative body; it can\r\nmake sundry regulations for the management of its local affairs. Such\r\nregulations are known by a very ancient name, \"by-laws.\" _By_ is an Old\r\nNorse word meaning \"town,\" and it appears in the names of such towns as\r\n_Derby_ and _Whitby_ in the part of England overrun by the Danes in the\r\nninth and tenth centuries. By-laws are town laws[4].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: In modern usage the roles and regulations of clubs, learned\r\nsocieties, and other associations, are also called by-laws.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Power and responsibility.]\r\nIn the selectmen and various special officers the town has an\r\nexecutive department; and here let us observe that, while these\r\nofficials are kept strictly accountable to the people, they are\r\nentrusted with very considerable authority. Things are not so arranged\r\nthat an officer can plead that he has failed in his duty from lack of\r\npower. There is ample power, joined with complete responsibility. This\r\nis especially to be noticed in the case of the selectmen. They must\r\noften be called upon to exercise a wide discretion in what they do,\r\nyet this excites no serious popular distrust or jealousy. The annual\r\nelection affords an easy means of dropping an unsatisfactory officer.\r\nBut in practice nothing has been more common than for the same persons\r\nto be reelected as selectmen or constables or town-clerks for year\r\nafter year, as long as they are able or willing to serve. The notion\r\nthat there is anything peculiarly American or democratic in what\r\nis known as \"rotation in office\" is therefore not sustained by the\r\npractice of the New England town, which is the most complete democracy\r\nin the world. It is the most perfect exhibition of what President\r\nLincoln called \"government of the people by the people and for the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

What of the power and responsibility of selectmen?\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 2. _Origin of the Township_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Town-meetings in Greece and Rome.]\r\nIt was said above that government by town-meeting is in principle the\r\noldest form of government known in the world. The student of ancient\r\nhistory is familiar with the _comitia_ of the Romans and the\r\n_ecclesia_ of the Greeks. These were popular assemblies, held in\r\nthose soft climates in the open air, usually in the market-place,--the\r\nRoman _forum_, the Greek _agora_. The government carried on\r\nin them was a more or less qualified democracy. In the palmy days of\r\nAthens it was a pure democracy. The assemblies which in the Athenian\r\nmarket-place declared war against Syracuse, or condemned Socrates to\r\ndeath, were quite like New England town-meetings, except that they\r\nexercised greater powers because there was no state government above\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clans.]\r\nThe principle of the town-meeting, however, is older than Athens or\r\nRome. Long before streets were built or fields fenced in, men wandered\r\nabout the earth hunting for food in family parties, somewhat as lions\r\ndo in South Africa. Such family groups were what we call _clans_,\r\nand so far as is known they were the earliest form in which civil\r\nsociety appeared on the earth. Among all wandering or partially\r\nsettled tribes the clan is to be found, and there are ample\r\nopportunities for studying it among our Indians in North America. The\r\nclan usually has a chief or head-man, useful mainly as a leader in\r\nwartime; its civil government, crude and disorderly enough, is in\r\nprinciple a pure democracy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _mark_ and the _tun_.]\r\nWhen our ancestors first became acquainted with American Indians, the\r\nmost advanced tribes lived partly by hunting and fishing, but partly\r\nalso by raising Indian corn and pumpkins. They had begun to live in\r\nwigwams grouped together in small villages and surrounded by strong rows\r\nof palisades for defence. Now what these red men were doing our own\r\nfair-haired ancestors in northern and central Europe had been doing some\r\ntwenty centuries earlier. The Scandinavians and Germans, when first\r\nknown in history, had made considerable progress in exchanging a\r\nwandering for a settled mode of life. When the clan, instead of moving\r\nfrom place to place, fixed upon some spot for a permanent residence, a\r\nvillage grew up there, surrounded by a belt of waste land, or somewhat\r\nlater by a stockaded wall. The belt of land was called a _mark_, and the\r\nwall was called a _tun_.[5] Afterwards the enclosed space came to be\r\nknown sometimes as the _mark_, sometimes as the _tun_ or _town_. In\r\nEngland the latter name prevailed. The inhabitants of a mark or town\r\nwere a stationary clan. It was customary to call them by the clan name,\r\nas for example \"the Beorings\" or \"the Crossings;\" then the town would be\r\ncalled _Barrington_, \"town of the Beorings,\" or _Cressingham_,\r\n\"home of the Cressings.\" Town names of this sort, with which the map of\r\nEngland is thickly studded, point us back to a time when the town was\r\nsupposed to be the stationary home of a clan.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pronounced \"toon.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Old English township.]\r\n[Sidenote: The manor.]\r\nThe Old English town had its _tungemot_, or town-meeting, in\r\nwhich \"by-laws\" were made and other important business transacted.\r\nThe principal officers were the \"reeve\" or head-man, the \"beadle\" or\r\nmessenger, and the \"tithing-man\" or petty constable. These officers\r\nseem at first to have been elected by the people, but after a while,\r\nas great lordships grew up, usurping jurisdiction over the land, the\r\nlord's steward and bailiff came to supersede the reeve and beadle.\r\nAfter the Norman Conquest the townships, thus brought under the sway\r\nof great lords, came to be generally known by the French name of\r\nmanors or \"dwelling places.\" Much might be said about this change, but\r\nhere it is enough for us to bear in mind that a manor was essentially\r\na township in which the chief executive officers were directly\r\nresponsible to the lord rather than to the people. It would be\r\nwrong, however, to suppose that the manors entirely lost their\r\nself-government. Even the ancient town-meeting survived in them, in a\r\nfragmentary way, in several interesting assemblies, of which the most\r\ninteresting were the _court leet_, for the election of certain\r\nofficers and the trial of petty offences, and the _court baron_,\r\nwhich was much like a town-meeting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The parish.]\r\nStill more of the old self-government would doubtless have survived\r\nin the institutions of the manor if it had not been provided for in\r\nanother way. The _parish_ was older than the manor. After the\r\nEnglish had been converted to Christianity local churches were\r\ngradually set up all over the country, and districts called parishes\r\nwere assigned for the ministrations of the priests. Now a parish\r\ngenerally coincided in area with a township, or sometimes with a group\r\nof two or three townships. In the old heathen times each town seems to\r\nhave had its sacred place or shrine consecrated to some local deity,\r\nand it was a favourite policy with the Roman missionary priests to\r\npurify the old shrine and turn it into a church. In this way the\r\ntownship at the same time naturally became the parish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Township, manor, and parish.]\r\n[Sidenote: The vestry-meeting.]\r\nAs we find it in later times, both before and since the founding of\r\nEnglish colonies in North America, the township in England is likely\r\nto be both a manor and a parish. For some purposes it is the one, for\r\nsome purposes it is the other. The townsfolk may be regarded as a\r\ngroup of tenants of the lord's manor, or as a group of parishioners of\r\nthe local church. In the latter aspect the parish retained much of the\r\nself-government of the ancient town. The business with which the lord\r\nwas entitled to meddle was strictly limited, and all other business\r\nwas transacted in the \"vestry-meeting,\" which was practically the old\r\ntown-meeting under a new name. In the course of the thirteenth century\r\nwe find that the parish had acquired the right of taxing itself for\r\nchurch purposes. Money needed for the church was supplied in the\r\nform of \"church-rates\" voted by the ratepayers themselves in the\r\nvestry-meeting, so called because it was originally held in a room of\r\nthe church in which vestments were kept.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parish officers.]\r\nThe officers of the parish were the constable, the parish and vestry\r\nclerks,[6] the beadle,[7] the \"waywardens\" or surveyors of highways,\r\nthe \"haywards\" or fence-viewers, the \"common drivers,\" the collectors\r\nof taxes, and at the beginning of the seventeenth century overseers of\r\nthe poor were added. There were also churchwardens, usually two for\r\neach, parish. Their duties were primarily to take care of the church\r\nproperty, assess the rates, and call the vestry-meetings. They also\r\nacted as overseers of the poor, and thus in several ways remind one of\r\nthe selectmen of New England. The parish officers were all elected by\r\nthe ratepayers assembled in vestry-meeting, except the common driver\r\nand hayward, who were elected by the same ratepayers assembled in\r\ncourt leet. Besides electing parish officers and granting the rates,\r\nthe vestry-meeting could enact by-laws; and all ratepayers had an\r\nequal voice in its deliberations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Of these two officers the vestry clerk is the counterpart\r\nof the New England town-clerk.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Originally a messenger or crier, the beadle came to\r\nassume some of the functions of the tithing-man or petty constable,\r\nsuch as keeping order in church, punishing petty offenders, waiting on\r\nthe clergyman, etc. In New England towns there were formerly officers\r\ncalled tithing-men, who kept order in church, arrested tipplers,\r\nloafers, and Sabbath-breakers, etc.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The transition from England to New England.]\r\nDuring the last two centuries the constitution of the English parish\r\nhas undergone some modifications which need not here concern us. The\r\nPuritans who settled in New England had grown up under such parish\r\ngovernment as is here described, and they were used to hearing the\r\nparish called, on some occasions and for some purposes, a township. If\r\nwe remember now that the earliest New England towns were founded\r\nby church congregations, led by their pastors, we can see how town\r\ngovernment in New England originated. It was simply the English\r\nparish government brought into a new country and adapted to the new\r\nsituation. Part of this new situation consisted in the fact that the\r\nlords of the manor were left behind. There was no longer any occasion\r\nto distinguish between the township as a manor and the township as a\r\nparish; and so, as the three names had all lived on together, side by\r\nside, in England, it was now the oldest and most generally descriptive\r\nname, \"township,\" that survived, and has come into use throughout a\r\ngreat part of the United States. The townsfolk went on making by-laws,\r\nvoting supplies of public money, and electing their magistrates in\r\nAmerica, after the fashion with which they had for ages been familiar\r\nin England. Some of their offices and customs were of hoary antiquity.\r\nIf age gives respectability, the office of constable may vie with that\r\nof king; and if the annual town-meeting is usually held in the month\r\nof March, it is because in days of old, long before Magna Charta was\r\nthought of, the rules and regulations for the village husbandry were\r\ndiscussed and adopted in time for the spring planting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Building up states.]\r\nTo complete our sketch of the origin of the New England town, one\r\npoint should here be briefly mentioned in anticipation of what will\r\nhave to be said hereafter; but it is a point of so much importance\r\nthat we need not mind a little repetition in stating it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Representation.]\r\nWe have seen what a great part taxation plays in the business of\r\ngovernment, and we shall presently have to treat of county, state, and\r\nfederal governments, all of them wider in their sphere than the town\r\ngovernment. In the course of history, as nations have gradually been\r\nbuilt up, these wider governments have been apt to absorb or supplant\r\nand crush the narrower governments, such as the parish or township;\r\nand this process has too often been destructive to political freedom.\r\nSuch a result is, of course, disastrous to everybody; and if it were\r\nunavoidable, it would be better that great national governments need\r\nnever be formed. But it is not unavoidable. There is one way of\r\nescaping it, and that is to give the little government of the town\r\nsome real share in making up the great government of the state. That\r\nis not an easy thing to do, as is shown by the fact that most peoples\r\nhave failed in the attempt. The people who speak the English language\r\nhave been the most successful, and the device by which they have\r\novercome the difficulty is REPRESENTATION. The town sends to the wider\r\ngovernment a delegation of persons who can _represent_ the town\r\nand its people. They can speak for the town, and have a voice in the\r\nframing of laws and imposition of taxes by the wider government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shire-motes.]\r\n[Sidenote: Earl Simon's Parliament.]\r\nIn English townships there has been from time immemorial a system of\r\nrepresentation. Long before Alfred's time there were \"shire-motes,\" or\r\nwhat were afterwards called county meetings, and to these each town\r\nsent its reeve and \"four discreet men\" as _representatives_. Thus\r\nto a certain extent the wishes of the townsfolk could be brought to\r\nbear upon county affairs. By and by this method was applied on a much\r\nwider scale. It was applied to the whole kingdom, so that the people\r\nof all its towns and parishes succeeded in securing a representation\r\nof their interests in an elective national council or House of\r\nCommons. This great work was accomplished in the thirteenth century by\r\nSimon de Montfort, Earl of Leicester, and was completed by Edward\r\nI. Simon's parliament, the first in which the Commons were fully\r\nrepresented, was assembled in 1265; and the date of Edward's\r\nparliament, which has been called the Model Parliament, was 1295.\r\nThese dates have as much interest for Americans as for Englishmen,\r\nbecause they mark the first definite establishment of that grand\r\nsystem of representative government which we are still carrying on\r\nat our various state capitals and at Washington. For its humble\r\nbeginnings we have to look back to the \"reeve and four\" sent by the\r\nancient townships to the county meetings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Township as unit of representation.]\r\nThe English township or parish was thus at an early period the \"unit\r\nof representation\" in the government of the county. It was also a\r\ndistrict for the assessment and collection of the national taxes; in\r\neach parish the assessment was made by a board of assessors chosen by\r\npopular vote. These essential points reappear in the early history of\r\nNew England. The township was not only a self-governing body, but\r\nit was the \"unit of representation\" in the colonial legislature,\r\nor \"General Court;\" and the assessment of taxes, whether for town\r\npurposes or for state purposes, was made by assessors elected by the\r\ntownsfolk. In its beginnings and fundamentals our political liberty\r\ndid not originate upon American soil, but was brought hither by\r\nour forefathers the first settlers. They brought their political\r\ninstitutions with them as naturally as they brought their language and\r\ntheir social customs.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Russian village community; not represented in the\r\nnational government.]\r\nObserve now that the township is to be regarded in two lights. It must\r\nbe considered not only in itself, but as part of a greater whole.\r\nWe began by describing it as a self-governing body, but in order to\r\ncomplete our sketch we were obliged to speak of it as a body which\r\nhas a share in the government of the state and the nation. The latter\r\naspect is as important as the former. If the people of a town had only\r\nthe power of managing their local affairs, without the power of taking\r\npart in the management of national affairs, their political freedom\r\nwould be far from complete. In Russia, for example, the larger part of\r\nthe vast population is resident in village communities which have to a\r\nconsiderable extent the power of managing their local affairs. Such\r\na village community is called a _mir_, and like the English\r\ntownship it is lineally descended from the stationary clan. The people\r\nof the Russian _mir_ hold meetings in which they elect sundry\r\nlocal officers, distribute the burden of local taxation, make\r\nregulations concerning local husbandry and police, and transact other\r\nbusiness which need not here concern us. But they have no share in the\r\nnational government, and are obliged to obey laws which they have\r\nno voice in making, and pay taxes assessed upon them without their\r\nconsent; and accordingly we say with truth that the Russian people do\r\nnot possess political freedom. One reason for this has doubtless\r\nbeen that in times past the Russian territory was the great frontier\r\nbattle-ground between civilized Europe and the wild hordes of western\r\nAsia, and the people who lived for ages on that turbulent frontier\r\nwere subjected to altogether too much conquest. They have tasted too\r\nlittle of civil government and too much of military government,--a\r\npennyworth of wholesome bread to an intolerable deal of sack. The\r\nearly English, in their snug little corner of the world, belted by\r\nsalt sea, were able to develop their civil government with less\r\ndestructive interference. They made a sound and healthful beginning\r\nwhen they made the township the \"unit of representation\" for the\r\ncounty. Then the township, besides managing its own affairs, began to\r\ntake part in the management of wider affairs.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIVE QUESTIONS AND DIRECTIONS.\r\n\r\n1.

The various kinds of taxes raised in your town, the amount of each\r\n     kind, the valuation, the rate, the proposed use of the money, etc.\r\n  b. The work of any department of the town government for a year, as, for\r\n      example, that of the overseers of the poor.\r\n  c. Any pressing need of your town, public sentiment towards it, the\r\n      probable cost of satisfying it, the obstacles in the way of meeting\r\n      it, etc.\r\n\r\n3. A good way to arouse interest in the subject of town government is to\r\norganize the class as a town-meeting, and let it discuss live local\r\nquestions in accordance with articles in a warrant. For helpful details\r\nattend a town-meeting, read the record of some meeting, consult some\r\nperson familiar with town proceedings, or study the General Statutes.\r\n\r\nTo insure a discussion, it may be necessary at the outset for the\r\nteacher to assign to the several pupils single points to be expanded and\r\npresented in order.\r\n\r\nThere is an advantage in the teacher's serving as moderator. He may, as\r\nteacher, pause to give such directions and explanations as may be\r\nhelpful to young citizens.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should be held up to the more obvious requirements of\r\nparliamentary law, and shown how to use its rules to accomplish various\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n4. Has the state a right to direct the education of its youth? If the\r\nstate has such a right, are there any limits to the exercise of it? Does\r\nthe right to direct the education of its youth carry with it the right\r\nto abolish private schools?\r\n\r\n5. Is it wise to assist private educational institutions with public\r\nfunds?\r\n\r\n6. Ought teachers, if approved, to be appointed for one year only, or\r\nduring good behaviour?\r\n\r\n7.

Is it right to tax both for $1000? Suppose B with\r\nthe money buys goods of C. Is it right to tax the three for $1000 each?\r\n\r\n11. A taxpayer worth $100,000 in personal property makes no return to\r\nthe assessors. In their ignorance the assessors tax him for $50,000\r\nonly, and the tax is paid without question. Does the taxpayer act\r\nhonourably?\r\n\r\n12. What difficulties beset the work of the assessors?\r\n\r\n13. Would anything be gained by exempting personal property from\r\ntaxation? If so, what? Would anything be lost? If so, what?\r\n\r\n14. Does any one absolutely escape taxation?\r\n\r\n15. Does the poll-tax payer pay, in any sense, more than his poll-tax?\r\n\r\n16. Are there any taxes that people pay without seeming to know it? If\r\nso, what? (See below, chap. viii. section 8.).\r\n\r\n17. Have we clans to-day among ourselves?

In treating of the township we began by\r\nsketching it in its fullest development, as seen in New England. With.\r\nthe county we shall find it helpful to pursue a different method and\r\nstart at the beginning.\r\n\r\nIf we look at the maps of the states which make up our Union, we see\r\nthat they are all divided into counties (except that in Louisiana the\r\ncorresponding divisions are named parishes). The map of England shows\r\nthat country as similarly divided into counties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Why do we have counties?]\r\nIf we ask why this is so, some people will tell us that it is\r\nconvenient, for purposes of administration, to have a state, or a\r\nkingdom, divided into areas that are larger than single towns. There\r\nis much truth in this. It is convenient. If it were not so, counties\r\nwould not have survived, so as to make a part of our modern maps.\r\nNevertheless, this is not the historic reason why we have the\r\nparticular kind of subdivisions known as counties. We have them\r\nbecause our fathers and grandfathers had them; and thus, if we would\r\nfind out the true reason, we may as well go back to the ancient times\r\nwhen our forefathers were establishing themselves in England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Clans and tribes.]\r\nWe have seen how the clan of our barbarous ancestors, when it became\r\nstationary, was established as the town or township. But in those early\r\ntimes _clans_ were generally united more or less closely into _tribes_.\r\nAmong all primitive or barbarous races of men, so far as we can make\r\nout, society is organized in tribes, and each tribe is made up of a\r\nnumber of clans or family groups. Now when our English forefathers\r\nconquered Britain they settled there as clans and also as tribes. The\r\nclans became townships, and the tribes became shires or counties; that\r\nis to say, the names were applied first to the people and afterwards to\r\nthe land they occupied. A few of the oldest county names in England\r\nstill show this plainly. _Essex_, _Middlesex_, and _Sussex_ were\r\noriginally \"East Saxons,\" \"Middle Saxons,\" and \"South Saxons;\" and on\r\nthe eastern coast two tribes of Angles were distinguished as \"North\r\nfolk\" and \"South folk,\" or _Norfolk_ and _Suffolk_. When you look on the\r\nmap and see the town of _Icklinghiam_ in the county of _Suffolk_, it\r\nmeans that this place was once known as the \"home\" of the \"Icklings\" or\r\n\"children of Ickel,\" a clan which formed part of the tribe of \"South\r\nfolk.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The English nation, like the American, grew out of the\r\nunion of small states.]\r\nIn those days there was no such thing as a Kingdom of England; there\r\nwere only these groups of tribes living side by side. Each tribe had its\r\nleader, whose title was _ealdorman_ or \"elder man.\" [1] After a while, as\r\nsome tribes increased in size and power, their ealdormen took the title\r\nof kings. The little kingdoms coincided sometimes with a single shire,\r\nsometimes with two or more shires. Thus there was a kingdom of Kent, and\r\nthe North and South Folk were combined in a kingdom of East Anglia. In\r\ncourse of time numbers of shires combined into larger kingdoms, such as\r\nNorthumbria, Mercia, and the West Saxons; and finally the king of the\r\nWest Saxons became king of all England, and the several _shires_ became\r\nsubordinate parts or \"shares\" of the kingdom. In England, therefore, the\r\nshires are older than the nation. The shires were not made by dividing\r\nthe nation, but the nation was made by uniting the shires. The English\r\nnation, like the American, grew out of the union of little states that\r\nhad once been independent of one another, but had many interests in\r\ncommon. For not less than three hundred years after all England had been\r\nunited under one king, these shires retained their self-government\r\nalmost as completely as the several states of the American Union.[2] A\r\nfew words about their government will not be wasted, for they will help\r\nto throw light upon some things that still form a part of our political\r\nand social life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The pronunciation, was probably something like yáwl-dor-man.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Chalmers, _Local Government_, p. 90.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shire-mote, ealdorman, and sheriff.]\r\nThe shire was governed by the _shire-mote_ (i.e. \"meeting\"),\r\nwhich was a representative body. Lords of lands, including abbots and\r\npriors, attended it, as well as the reeve and four selected men\r\nfrom each township. There were thus the germs of both the kind of\r\nrepresentation that is seen in the House of Lords and the much more\r\nperfect kind that is seen in the House of Commons. After a while,\r\nas cities and boroughs grew in importance, they sent representative\r\nburghers to the shire-mote. There were two presiding officers; one was\r\nthe _ealdorman_, who was now appointed by the king; the other was\r\nthe _shire-reeve_ (i.e. \"sheriff\"), who was still elected by the\r\npeople and generally held office for life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The county court.]\r\nThis shire-mote was both a legislative body and a court of justice. It\r\nnot only made laws for the shire, but it tried civil and criminal\r\ncauses. After the Norman Conquest some changes occurred. The shire now\r\nbegan to be called by the French name \"county,\" because of its analogy\r\nto the small pieces of territory on the Continent that were governed by\r\n\"counts.\" [3] The shire-mote became known as the county court, but cases\r\ncoming before it were tried by the king's _justices in eyre_, or circuit\r\njudges, who went about from county to county to preside over the\r\njudicial work. The office of ealdorman became extinct. The sheriff was\r\nno longer elected by the people for life, but appointed by the king for\r\nthe term of one year. This kept him strictly responsible to the king. It\r\nwas the sheriff's duty to see that the county's share of the national\r\ntaxes was duly collected and paid over to the national treasury. The\r\nsheriff also summoned juries and enforced the judgments of the courts,\r\nand if he met with resistance in so doing he was authorized to call out\r\na force of men, known as the _posse comitatus_ (i.e. power of the\r\ncounty), and overcome all opposition. Another county officer was the\r\n_coroner_, or crowner_,[4] so called because originally (in Alfred's\r\ntime) he was appointed by the king, and was especially the crown officer\r\nin the county. Since the time of Edward I., however, coroners have been\r\nelected by the people. Originally coroners held small courts of inquiry\r\nupon cases of wreckage, destructive fires, or sudden death, but in\r\ncourse of time their jurisdiction became confined to the last-named\r\nclass of cases. If a death occurred under circumstances in any way\r\nmysterious or likely to awaken suspicion, it was the business of the\r\ncoroner, assisted by not less than twelve _jurors_ (i. e, \"sworn men\"),\r\nto hold an _inquest_ for the purpose of ascertaining the cause of death.\r\nThe coroner could compel the attendance of witnesses and order a medical\r\nexamination of the body, and if there were sufficient evidence to charge\r\nany person with murder or manslaughter, the coroner could have such\r\nperson arrested and committed for trial.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Originally _comites_, or \"companions\" of the king.]\r\n[Footnote 4: This form of the word, sometimes supposed to be a vulgarism,\r\nis as correct as the other. See Skeat, _Etym_. Dict., s.v.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justices of the peace.]\r\n[Sidenote: The Quarter sessions.]\r\n[Sidenote: The lord-lieutenant.]\r\nAnother important county officer was the _justice of the peace_.\r\nOriginally six were appointed by the crown in each county, but in\r\nlater times any number might be appointed. The office was created by a\r\nseries of statutes in the reign of Edward III., in order to put a stop\r\nto the brigandage which still flourished in England; it was a common\r\npractice for robbers to seize persons and hold them for ransom.[5] By\r\nthe last of these statutes, in 1362, the justices of the peace in each\r\ncounty were to hold a court four times in the year. The powers of this\r\ncourt, which came to be known as the Quarter Sessions, were from time\r\nto time increased by act of parliament, until it quite supplanted the\r\nold county court. In modern times the Quarter Sessions has become\r\nan administrative body quite as much as a court. The justices, who\r\nreceive no salary, hold office for life, or during good behaviour.\r\nThey appoint the chief constable of the county, who appoints the\r\npolice. They also take part in the supervision of highways and\r\nbridges, asylums and prisons. Since the reign of Henry VIII., the\r\nEnglish county has had an officer known as the lord-lieutenant, who\r\nwas once leader of the county militia, but whose functions to-day are\r\nthose of keeper of the records and principal justice of the peace.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Longman's _Life and Times of Edward III._, vol. i.\r\np. 301.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beginnings of Massachusetts counties.]\r\nDuring the past five hundred years the English county has gradually\r\nsunk from a self-governing community into an administrative district;\r\nand in recent times its boundaries have been so crossed and\r\ncrisscrossed with those of other administrative areas, such as those\r\nof school-boards, sanitary boards, etc., that very little of the old\r\ncounty is left in recognizable shape. Most of this change has been\r\neffected since the Tudor period. The first English settlers in America\r\nwere familiar with the county as a district for the administration of\r\njustice, and they brought with them coroners, sheriffs, and quarter\r\nsessions. In 1635 the General Court of Massachusetts appointed four\r\ntowns--Boston, Cambridge, Salem, and Ipswich--as places where courts\r\nshould be held quarterly. In 1643 the colony, which then included\r\nas much of New Hampshire as was settled, was divided into four\r\n\"shires,\"--Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk, the latter lying\r\nthen to the northward and including the New Hampshire towns. The\r\nmilitia was then organized, perhaps without consciousness of the\r\nanalogy, after a very old English fashion; the militia of each town\r\nformed a company, and the companies of the shire formed a regiment.\r\nThe county was organized from the beginning as a judicial district,\r\nwith its court-house, jail, and sheriff. After 1697 the court, held by\r\nthe justices of the peace, was called the Court of General Sessions.\r\nIt could try criminal causes not involving the penalty of death or\r\nbanishment, and civil causes in which the value at stake was less than\r\nforty shillings. It also had control over highways going from town to\r\ntown; and it apportioned the county taxes among the several towns.\r\n\r\nThe justices and sheriff were appointed by the governor, as in England\r\nby the king.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

The county, like the town, is a corporation; it can hold\r\nproperty and sue or be sued. It builds the court-house and jail, and\r\nkeeps them in repair. The town in which these buildings are placed is\r\ncalled, as in England, the shire town.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: County commissioners.]\r\nIn each county there are three commissioners, elected by the people.\r\nTheir term of service is three years, and one goes out each year.\r\nThese commissioners represent the county in law-suits, as the\r\nselectmen represent the town. They \"apportion the county taxes among\r\nthe towns;\" \"lay out, alter, and discontinue highways within the\r\ncounty;\" \"have charge of houses of correction;\" and erect and keep in\r\nrepair the county buildings.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Martin's _Civil Government_, p. 197.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: County treasurer.]\r\nThe revenues of the county are derived partly from taxation and partly\r\nfrom the payment of fines and costs in the courts. These revenues are\r\nreceived and disbursed by the county treasurer, who is elected by the\r\npeople for a term of three years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Courts.]\r\nThe Superior Court of the state holds at least two sessions annually\r\nin each county, and tries civil and criminal causes. There is also\r\nin each county a probate court with jurisdiction over all matters\r\nrelating to wills, administration of estates, and appointment of\r\nguardians; it also acts as a court of insolvency. The custody of wills\r\nand documents relating to the business of this court is in the hands\r\nof an officer known as the register of probate, who is elected by the\r\npeople for a term of five years.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Shire town and court-house.]\r\nTo preserve the records of all land-titles and transfers of land\r\nwithin the county, all deeds and mortgages are registered in an\r\noffice in the shire town, usually within or attached to the court The\r\nregister of deeds is an officer elected by the people for a term of\r\nthree years. In counties where there is much business there may be\r\nmore than one.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Justices of the peace.]\r\nJustices of the peace are appointed by the governor for a term of seven\r\nyears, and the appointment may be renewed. Their functions have been\r\ngreatly curtailed, and now amount to little more than administering\r\noaths, and in some cases issuing warrants and taking bail. They may join\r\npersons in marriage, and, when specially commissioned as \"trial\r\njustices,\" have criminal jurisdiction over sundry petty offences.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sheriff.]\r\nThe sheriff is elected by the people for a term of three years. He may\r\nappoint deputies, for whom he is responsible, to assist him in his\r\nwork. He must attend all county courts, and the meetings of the county\r\ncommissioners whenever required. He must inflict, either personally\r\nor by deputy, the sentence of the court, whether it be fine,\r\nimprisonment, or death. He is responsible for the preservation of the\r\npeace within the county, and to this end must pursue criminals and may\r\narrest disorderly persons. If he meets with resistance he may call out\r\nthe _posse comitatus_; if the resistance grows into insurrection\r\nhe may apply to the governor and obtain the aid of the state militia;\r\nif the insurrection proves too formidable to be thus dealt with, the\r\ngovernor may in his behalf apply to the president of the United States\r\nfor aid from the regular army. In this way the force that may be\r\ndrawn upon, if necessary, for the suppression of disorder in a single\r\nlocality, is practically unlimited and irresistible.\r\n\r\nWe have now obtained a clear outline view of the township and county in\r\nthemselves and in their relation to one another, with an occasional\r\nglimpse of their relation to the state; in so far, at least, as such a\r\nview can be gained from a reference to the history of England and of\r\nMassachusetts. We must next trace the development of local government in\r\nother parts of the United States; and in doing so we can advance at\r\nsomewhat quicker pace, not because our subject becomes in any wise less\r\nimportant or less interesting, but because we have already marked out\r\nthe ground and said things of general application which will not need to\r\nbe said over again.\r\n\r\n\r\n  QUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n  Give an account of the modern county in Massachusetts under\r\n  the following heads:--\r\n\r\n  1. The county a corporation.\r\n  2. The county commissioners and their duties.\r\n  3. The county treasurer and his duties.\r\n  4. The courts held in a county.\r\n  5. The shire town and the court-house.\r\n  6. The register of deeds and his duties.\r\n  7. Justices of the peace and trial justices.\r\n  8. The sheriff and his duties.\r\n  9. The force at the sheriff's disposal to suppress disorder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. _The Old Virginia County._\r\n\r\nBy common consent of historians, the two most distinctive and most\r\ncharacteristic lines of development which English forms of government\r\nhave followed, in propagating themselves throughout the United States,\r\nare the two lines that have led through New England on the one hand\r\nand through Virginia on the other. We have seen what shape local\r\ngovernment assumed in New England; let us now observe what shape it\r\nassumed in the Old Dominion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virginia sparsely settled.]\r\nThe first point to be noticed in the early settlement of Virginia is\r\nthat people did not live so near together as in New England. This was\r\nbecause tobacco, cultivated on large estates, was a source of wealth.\r\nTobacco drew settlers to Virginia as in later days gold drew settlers\r\nto California and sparsely Australia. They came not in organized\r\ngroups or congregations, but as a multitude of individuals. Land\r\nwas granted to individuals, and sometimes these grants were of\r\nenormous extent. John Bolling, who died in 1757, left an estate of\r\n40,000 acres, and this is not mentioned as an extraordinary amount of\r\nland for one man to own.[7] From an early period it was customary\r\nto keep these great estates together by entailing them, and this\r\ncontinued until entails were abolished in 1776 through the influence\r\nof Thomas Jefferson.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Edward Channing, \"Town and County Government,\" in\r\n_Johns Hopkins University Studies_, vol. ii. p. 467.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Absence of towns.]\r\nA glance at the map of Virginia shows to what a remarkable degree it\r\nis intersected by navigable rivers. This fact made it possible for\r\nplantations, even at a long distance from the coast, to have each its\r\nown private wharf, where a ship from England could unload its cargo of\r\ntools, cloth, or furniture, and receive a cargo of tobacco in return.\r\nAs the planters were thus supplied with most of the necessaries of\r\nlife, there was no occasion for the kind of trade that builds up\r\ntowns. Even in comparatively recent times the development of town life\r\nin Virginia has been very slow. In 1880, out of 246 cities and towns\r\nin the United States with a population exceeding 10,000, there were\r\nonly six in Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slavery]\r\nThe cultivation of tobacco upon large estates caused a great demand for\r\ncheap labour, and this was supplied partly by bringing negro slaves from\r\nAfrica, partly by bringing criminals from English jails. The latter were\r\nsold into slavery for a limited term of years, and were known as\r\n\"indentured white servants.\" So great was the demand for labour that it\r\nbecame customary to kidnap poor friendless wretches on the streets of\r\nseaport towns in England and ship them off to Virginia to be sold into\r\nservitude. At first these white servants were more numerous than the\r\nnegroes, but before the end of the seventeenth century the blacks had\r\ncome to be much the more numerous.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Social position of settlers.]\r\nIn this rural community the owners of plantations came from the same\r\nclasses of society as the settlers of New England; they were for the\r\nmost part country squires and yeomen. But while in New England there\r\nwas no lower class or society sharply marked off from the upper, on\r\nthe other hand in Virginia there was an insurmountable distinction\r\nbetween the owners of plantations and the so-called \"mean whites\" or\r\n\"white trash.\" This class was originally formed of men and women\r\nwho had been indentured white servants, and was increased by such\r\nshiftless people as now and then found their way to the colony, but\r\ncould not win estates or obtain social recognition. With such a\r\nsharp division between classes, an aristocratic type of society was\r\ndeveloped in Virginia as naturally as a democratic type was developed\r\nin New England.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virginia parishes.]\r\n[Sidenote: The vestry of a close corporation.]\r\nIn Virginia there were no town-meetings. The distances between\r\nplantations cooperated with the distinction between classes to prevent\r\nthe growth of such an institution. The English parish, with its\r\nchurchwardens and vestry and clerk, was reproduced in Virginia under\r\nthe same name, but with some noteworthy peculiarities. If the whole\r\nbody of ratepayers had assembled in vestry meeting, to enact by-laws\r\nand assess taxes, the course of development would have been like that\r\nof the New England town-meeting. But instead of this the vestry, which\r\nexercised the chief authority in the parish, was composed of twelve\r\nchosen men. This was not government by a primary assembly, it was\r\nrepresentative government. At first the twelve vestrymen were elected\r\nby the people of the parish, and thus resembled the selectmen of\r\nNew England; but after a while \"they obtained the power of filling\r\nvacancies in their own number,\" so that they became what is called a\r\n\"close corporation,\" and the people had nothing to do with choosing\r\nthem. Strictly speaking, that was not representative government; it\r\nwas a step on the road that leads towards oligarchical or despotic\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers of the vestry.]\r\nIt was the vestry, thus constituted, that apportioned the parish\r\ntaxes, appointed the churchwardens, presented the minister for\r\ninduction into office, and acted as overseers of the poor. The\r\nminister presided in all vestry meetings. His salary was paid in\r\ntobacco, and in 1696 it was fixed by law at 16,000 pounds of tobacco\r\nyearly. In many parishes the churchwardens were the collectors of the\r\nparish taxes. The other officers, such as the sexton and the parish\r\nclerk, were appointed either by the minister or by the vestry.\r\n\r\nWith the local government thus administered, we see that the larger\r\npart of the people had little directly to do. Nevertheless in these\r\nsmall neighbourhoods government was in full sight of the people. Its\r\nproceedings went on in broad daylight and were sustained by public\r\nsentiment. As Jefferson said, \"The vestrymen are usually the most\r\ndiscreet farmers, so distributed through the parish that every part of\r\nit may be under the immediate eye of some one of them. They are well\r\nacquainted with the details and economy of private life, and they\r\nfind sufficient inducements to execute their charge well, in their\r\nphilanthropy, in the approbation of their neighbours, and the\r\ndistinction which that gives them.\" [8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See Howard, _Local Constitutional History of the United\r\nStates_, vol. i. p. 122.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The county was the unit of representation.]\r\nThe difference, however, between the New England township and the\r\nVirginia parish, in respect of self-government, was striking enough.\r\nWe have now to note a further difference. In New England, as we have\r\nseen, the township was the unit of representation in the colonial\r\nlegislature; but in Virginia the parish was not the unit of\r\nrepresentation. The county was that unit. In the colonial legislature\r\nof Virginia the representatives sat not for parishes, but for\r\ncounties. The difference is very significant. As the political life of\r\nNew England was in a manner built up out of the political life of\r\nthe towns, so the political life of Virginia was built up out of the\r\npolitical life of the counties. This was partly because the vast\r\nplantations were not grouped about a compact village nucleus like the\r\nsmall farms at the North, and partly because there was not in Virginia\r\nthat Puritan theory of the church according to which each congregation\r\nis a self-governing democracy. The conditions which made the New\r\nEngland town-meeting were absent. The only alternative was some kind\r\nof representative government, and for this the county was a small\r\nenough area. The county in Virginia was much smaller than in\r\nMassachusetts or Connecticut. In a few instances the county consisted\r\nof only a single parish; in some cases it was divided into two\r\nparishes, but oftener into three or more.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The county court was virtually a close corporation.]\r\nIn Virginia, as in England and in New England, the county was an area\r\nfor the administration of justice. There were usually in each county\r\neight justices of the peace, and their court was the counterpart of\r\nthe Quarter Sessions in England. They were appointed by the governor,\r\nbut it was customary for them to nominate candidates for the governor\r\nto appoint, so that practically the court filled its own vacancies and\r\nwas a close corporation, like the parish vestry. Such an arrangement\r\ntended to keep the general supervision and control of things in the\r\nhands of a few families.\r\n\r\nThis county court usually met as often as once a month in some\r\nconvenient spot answering to the shire town of England or New England.\r\nMore often than not the place originally consisted of the court-house\r\nand very little else, and was named accordingly from the name of the\r\ncounty, as Hanover Court House or Fairfax Court House; and the small\r\nshire towns that have grown up in such spots often retain these names\r\nto the present day. Such names occur commonly in Virginia, West\r\nVirginia, and South Carolina, very rarely in Kentucky, North Carolina,\r\nAlabama, Ohio, and nowhere else in the United States.[9] Their number\r\nhas diminished from the tendency to omit the phrase \"Court House,\"\r\nleaving the name of the county for that of the shire town, as for\r\nexample in Culpeper, Va. In New England the process of naming has been\r\njust the reverse; as in Hartford County, Conn., or Worcester County,\r\nMass., which have taken their names from the shire towns. In this,\r\nas in so many cases, whole chapters of history are wrapped up in\r\ngeographical names.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: In Mitchell's Atlas, 1883, the number of cases is in Va.\r\n38, W. Va. 13, S. C. 16, N. C. 2, Ala. 1, Ky. 1, Ohio, 1.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: A few of the oldest Virginia counties, organized as\r\nsuch in 1634, had arisen from the spreading and thinning of single\r\nsettlements originally intended to be cities and named accordingly.\r\nHence the curious names (at first sight unintelligible) of \"James City\r\nCounty,\" and \"Charles City County.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers of the court]\r\nThe county court in Virginia had jurisdiction in criminal actions not\r\ninvolving peril of life or limb, and in civil suits where the sum at\r\nstake exceeded twenty-five shillings. Smaller suits could be tried\r\nby a single justice. The court also had charge of the probate and\r\nadministration of wills. The court appointed its own clerk, who kept\r\nthe county records. It superintended the construction and repair of\r\nbridges and highways, and for this purpose divided the county into\r\n\"precincts,\" and appointed annually for each precinct a highway\r\nsurveyor. The court also seems to have appointed constables, one for\r\neach precinct. The justices could themselves act as coroners, but\r\nannually two or more coroners for each parish were appointed by the\r\ngovernor. As we have seen that the parish taxes--so much for salaries\r\nof minister and clerk, so much for care of church buildings, so much\r\nfor relief of the poor, etc.--were computed and assessed by the\r\nvestry; so the county taxes, for care of court-house and jail, roads\r\nand bridges, coroner's fees, and allowances to the representatives\r\nsent to the colonial legislature, were computed and assessed by the\r\ncounty court. The general taxes for the colony were estimated by a\r\ncommittee of the legislature, as well as the county's share of the\r\ncolony tax.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sheriff.]\r\nThe taxes for the county, and sometimes the taxes for the parish also,\r\nwere collected by the sheriff. They were usually paid, not in money,\r\nbut in tobacco; and the sheriff was the custodian of this tobacco,\r\nresponsible for its proper disposal. The sheriff was thus not only\r\nthe officer for executing the judgments of the court, but he was also\r\ncounty treasurer and collector, and thus exercised powers almost as\r\ngreat as those of the sheriff in England in the twelfth century. He\r\nalso presided over elections for representatives to the legislature.\r\nIt is interesting to observe how this very important officer was\r\nchosen. \"Each year the court presented the names of three of its\r\nmembers to the governor, who appointed one, generally the senior\r\njustice, to be the sheriff of the county for the ensuing year.\" [11]\r\nHere again we see this close corporation, the county court, keeping\r\nthe control of things within its own hands.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Edward Channing, _op. cit_. p. 478.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The county lieutenant]\r\nOne other important county officer needs to be mentioned. We have seen\r\nthat in early New England each town had its train-band or company of\r\nmilitia, and that the companies in each county united to form the\r\ncounty regiment. In Virginia it was just the other way. Each county\r\nraised a certain number of troops, and because it was not convenient\r\nfor the men to go many miles from home in assembling for purposes of\r\ndrill, the county was subdivided into military districts, each with\r\nits company, according to rules laid down by the governor. The\r\nmilitary command in each county was vested in the county lieutenant,\r\nan officer answering in many respects to the lord lieutenant of\r\nthe English shire at that period. Usually he was a member of the\r\ngovernor's council, and as such exercised sundry judicial functions.\r\nHe bore the honorary title of \"colonel,\" and was to some extent\r\nregarded as the governor's deputy; but in later times his duties were\r\nconfined entirely to military matters.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: For an excellent account of local government in Virginia\r\nbefore the Revolution, see Howard, _Local Const. Hist. of the U.S._,\r\nvol. i. pp. 388-407; also Edward Ingle in _Johns Hopkins Univ.\r\nStudies_, III., ii.-iii.]\r\n\r\nIf now we sum up the contrasts between local government in Virginia\r\nand that in New England, we observe:--\r\n\r\n1. That in New England the management of local affairs was mostly in the\r\nhands of town officers, the county being superadded for certain\r\npurposes, chiefly judicial; while in Virginia the management was chiefly\r\nin the hands of county officers, though certain functions, chiefly\r\necclesiastical, were reserved to the parish.\r\n\r\n2. That in New England the local magistrates were almost always, with\r\nthe exception of justices, chosen by the people; while in Virginia,\r\nthough some of them were nominally appointed by the governor, yet in\r\npractice they generally contrived to appoint themselves--in other\r\nwords the local boards practically filled their own vacancies and were\r\nself-perpetuating.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Jefferson's opinion of township government.]\r\nThese differences are striking and profound. There can be no doubt\r\nthat, as Thomas Jefferson clearly saw, in the long run the interests\r\nof political liberty are much safer under the New England system\r\nthan under the Virginia system. Jefferson said, \"Those wards,\r\ncalled townships in New England, are the vital principle of their\r\ngovernments, and have proved themselves the wisest invention ever\r\ndevised by the wit of man for the perfect exercise of self-government,\r\nand for its preservation[13]....As Cato, then, concluded every speech\r\nwith the words _Carthago delenda est_, so do I every opinion with\r\nthe injunction: Divide the counties into wards!\" [14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Jefferson's _Works_, vii. 13.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: _Id_., vi. 544]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Court Day.\"]\r\nWe must, however, avoid the mistake of making too much of this contrast.\r\nAs already hinted, in those rural societies where people generally knew\r\none another, its effects were not so far-reaching as they would be in\r\nthe more complicated society of to-day. Even though Virginia had not the\r\ntown-meeting, it had its familiar court-day, which was a holiday for\r\nall the country-side, especially in the fall and spring. From all\r\ndirections came in the people on horseback, in wagons, and afoot. On the\r\ncourt-house green assembled, in indiscriminate confusion, people of all\r\nclasses,--the hunter from the backwoods, the owner of a few acres, the\r\ngrand proprietor, and the grinning, heedless negro. Old debts were\r\nsettled, and new ones made; there were auctions, transfers of property,\r\nand, if election times were near, stump-speaking.[15]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Virginia prolific in great leaders.]\r\nFor seventy years or more before the Declaration of Independence the\r\nmatters of general public concern, about which stump speeches were made\r\non Virginia court-days, were very similar to those that were discussed\r\nin Massachusetts town-meetings when representatives were to be chosen\r\nfor the legislature. Such questions generally related to some real or\r\nalleged encroachment upon popular liberties by the royal governor, who,\r\nbeing appointed and sent from beyond sea, was apt to have ideas and\r\npurposes of his own that conflicted with those of the people. This\r\nperpetual antagonism to the governor, who represented British imperial\r\ninterference with American local self-government, was an excellent\r\nschooling in political liberty, alike for Virginia and for\r\nMassachusetts. When the stress of the Revolution came, these two leading\r\ncolonies cordially supported each other, and their political\r\ncharacteristics were reflected in the kind of achievements for which\r\neach was especially distinguished. The Virginia system, concentrating\r\nthe administration of local affairs in the hands of a few county\r\nfamilies, was eminently favourable for developing skilful and vigorous\r\nleadership. And while in the history of Massachusetts during the\r\nRevolution we are chiefly impressed with the wonderful degree in which\r\nthe mass of the people exhibited the kind of political training that\r\nnothing in the world except the habit of parliamentary discussion can\r\nimpart; on the other hand, Virginia at that time gave us--in Washington,\r\nJefferson, Henry, Madison, and Marshall, to mention no others--such a\r\ngroup of consummate leaders as the world has seldom seen equalled.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Ingle, _loc. cit._]\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

There are some important points in the early history of local\r\ngovernment in other portions of the original thirteen states, to\r\nwhich we must next call attention; and then we shall be prepared to\r\nunderstand the manner in which our great western country has been\r\norganized under civil government. We must first say something about\r\nSouth Carolina and Maryland.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Parishes in South Carolina.]\r\nSouth Carolina was settled from half a century to a century later\r\nthan Massachusetts and Virginia, and by two distinct streams of\r\nimmigration. The lowlands near the coast were settled by Englishmen\r\nand by French Huguenots, but the form of government was purely\r\nEnglish. There were parishes, as in Virginia, but popular election\r\nplayed a greater part in them. The vestrymen were elected yearly by\r\nall the taxpayers of the parish. The minister was also elected by his\r\npeople, and after 1719 each parish sent its representatives to the\r\ncolonial legislature, though in a few instances two parishes were\r\njoined together for the purpose of choosing representatives. The\r\nsystem was thus more democratic than in Virginia; and in this\r\nconnection it is worth while to observe that parochial libraries and\r\nfree schools were established as early as 1712, much earlier than in\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The back country]\r\nDuring the first half of the eighteenth century a very different stream\r\nof immigration, coming mostly along the slope of the Alleghanies from\r\nVirginia and Pennsylvania, and consisting in great part of Germans,\r\nScotch Highlanders, and Scotch-Irish, peopled the upland western regions\r\nof South Carolina. For some time this territory had scarcely any civil\r\norganization. It was a kind of \"wild West.\" There were as yet no\r\ncounties in the colony. There was just one sheriff for the whole colony,\r\nwho \"held his office by patent from the crown.\" [1] A court sat in\r\nCharleston, but the arm of justice was hardly long enough to reach\r\noffenders in the mountains. \"To punish a horse-thief or prosecute a\r\ndebtor one was sometimes compelled to travel a distance of several\r\nhundred miles, and be subjected to all the dangers and delays incident\r\nto a wild country.\" When people cannot get justice in what in civilized\r\ncountries is the regular way, they will get it in some irregular way. So\r\nthese mountaineers began to form themselves into bands known as\r\n\"regulators,\" quite like the \"vigilance committees\" formed for the same\r\npurposes in California a hundred years later. For thieves and murderers\r\nthe \"regulators\" provided a speedy trial, and the nearest tree served as\r\na gallows.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: B. J. Ramage, in _Johns Hopkins Univ. Studies_, I., xii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The district system.]\r\nIn order to put a stop to this lynch law, the legislature in 1768\r\ndivided the back country into districts, each with its sheriff and\r\ncourt-house, and the judges were sent on circuit through these\r\ndistricts. The upland region with its districts was thus very\r\ndifferently organized from the lowland region with its parishes, and the\r\neffect was for a while almost like dividing South Carolina into two\r\nstates. At first the districts were not allowed to choose their own\r\nsheriffs, but in course of time they acquired this privilege. It was\r\ndifficult to apportion the representation in the state legislature so as\r\nto balance evenly the districts in the west against the parishes in the\r\neast, and accordingly there was much dissatisfaction, especially in the\r\nwest which did not get its fair share. In 1786 the capital was moved\r\nfrom Charleston to Columbia as a concession to the back country, and in\r\n1808 a kind of compromise was effected, in such wise that the uplands\r\nsecured a permanent majority in the house of representatives, while the\r\nlowlands retained control of the senate. The two sections had each its\r\nseparate state treasurer, and this kind of double government lasted\r\nuntil the Civil War.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The modern South Carolina county.]\r\nAt the close of the war \"the parishes were abolished and the district\r\nsystem was extended to the low country.\" But soon afterward, by the\r\nnew constitution of 1868, the districts were abolished and the state\r\nwas divided into 34 counties, each of which sends one senator to the\r\nstate senate, while they send representatives in proportion to\r\ntheir population. In each county the people elect three county\r\ncommissioners, a school commissioner, a sheriff, a judge of probate,\r\na clerk, and a coroner. In one respect the South Carolina county is\r\nquite peculiar: it has no organization for judicial purposes. \"The\r\ncounties, like their institutional predecessor the district, are\r\ngrouped into judicial circuits, and a judge is elected by the\r\nlegislature for each circuit. Trial justices are appointed by the\r\ngovernor for a term of two years.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The counties are too large.]\r\nThis system, like the simple county system everywhere, is a\r\nrepresentative system; the people take no direct part in the\r\nmanagement of affairs. In one respect it seems obviously to need\r\namendment. In states where county government has grown up naturally,\r\nafter the Virginia fashion, the county is apt to be much smaller than\r\nin states where it is simply a district embracing several township\r\ngovernments. Thus the average size of a county in Massachusetts is 557\r\nsquare miles, and in Connecticut 594 square miles; but in Virginia\r\nit is only 383 and in Kentucky 307 square miles. In South Carolina,\r\nhowever, where the county did not grow up of itself, but has been\r\nenacted, so to speak, by a kind of afterthought, it has been made too\r\nlarge altogether. The average area of the county in South Carolina is\r\nabout 1,000 square miles. Charleston County, more than 40 miles in\r\nlength and not less than 35 in average width, is larger than the\r\nstate of Rhode Island. Such an area is much too extensive for\r\nlocal self-government. Its different portions are too far apart to\r\nunderstand each other's local wants, or to act efficiently toward\r\nsupplying them; and roads, bridges, and free schools suffer\r\naccordingly. An unsuccessful attempt has been made to reduce the size\r\nof the counties. But what seems perhaps more likely to happen is the\r\npractical division of the counties into school districts, and the\r\ngradual development of these school districts into something like\r\nself-governing townships. To this very interesting point we shall\r\nagain have occasion to refer.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The _hundred_ in Maryland.]\r\n[Sidenote: Clans, brotherhoods, and tribes]\r\nWe come now to Maryland. The early history of local institutions in\r\nthis state is a fascinating subject of study. None of the American\r\ncolonies had a more distinctive character of its own, or reproduced\r\nold English usages in a more curious fashion. There was much in\r\ncolonial Maryland, with its lords of the manor, its bailiffs and\r\nseneschals, its courts baron and courts leet, to remind one of the\r\nEngland of the thirteenth century. But of these ancient institutions,\r\nlong since extinct, there is but one that needs to be mentioned in the\r\npresent connection. In Maryland the earliest form of civil community\r\nwas called, not a parish or township, but a _hundred_. This\r\ncurious designation is often met with in English history, and the\r\ninstitution which it describes, though now almost everywhere extinct,\r\nwas once almost universal among men. It will be remembered that the\r\noldest form of civil society, which is still to be found among some\r\nbarbarous races, was that in which families were organized into clans\r\nand clans into tribes; and we saw that among our forefathers in\r\nEngland the dwelling-place of the clan became the township, and the\r\nhome of the tribe became the shire or county. Now, in nearly all\r\nprimitive societies that have been studied, we find a group that is\r\nlarger than the clan but smaller than the tribe,--or, in other words,\r\nintermediate between clan and tribe. Scholars usually call this group\r\nby its Greek name, _phratry_ or \"brotherhood\", for it was known\r\nlong ago that in ancient Greece clans were grouped into brotherhoods\r\nand brotherhoods into tribes. Among uncivilized people all over the\r\nworld we find this kind of grouping. For example, a tribe of North\r\nAmerican Indians is regularly made up of phratries, and the phratries\r\nare made up of clans; and, strange as it might at first seem, a good\r\nmany half-understood features of early Greek and Roman society have\r\nhad much light thrown upon them from the study of the usages of\r\nCherokees and Mohawks.\r\n\r\nWherever men have been placed, the problem of forming civil society\r\nhas been in its main outlines the same; and in its earlier stages it\r\nhas been approached in pretty much the same way by all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The hundred court.]\r\nThe ancient Romans had the brotherhood, and called it a _curia_.\r\nThe Roman people were organized in clans, curies, and tribes. But for\r\nmilitary purposes the curia was called a _century_, because\r\nit furnished a quota of one hundred men to the army. The word\r\n_century_ originally meant a company of a hundred men, and it was\r\nonly by a figure of speech that it afterward came to mean a period\r\nof a hundred years. Now among all Germanic peoples, including the\r\nEnglish, the brotherhood seems to have been called the hundred.\r\nOur English forefathers seem to have been organized, like other\r\nbarbarians, in clans, brotherhoods, and tribes; and the brotherhood\r\nwas in some way connected with the furnishing a hundred warriors to\r\nthe host. In the tenth century we find England covered with small\r\ndistricts known as hundreds. Several townships together made a\r\nhundred, and several hundreds together made a shire. The hundred\r\nwas chiefly notable as the smallest area for the administration of\r\njustice. The hundred court was a representative body, composed of the\r\nlords of lands or their stewards, with the reeve and four selected men\r\nand the parish priest from each township. There was a chief magistrate\r\nfor the hundred, known originally as the hundredman, but after the\r\nNorman conquest as the high constable.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decay of the hundred.]\r\n[Sidenote: Hundred meetings in Maryland]\r\nBy the thirteenth century the importance of the hundred had much\r\ndiminished. The need for any such body, intermediate between township\r\nand county, ceased to be felt, and the functions of the hundred were\r\ngradually absorbed by the county. Almost everywhere in England, by the\r\nreign of Elizabeth, the hundred had fallen into decay. It is curious\r\nthat its name and some of its peculiarities should have been brought\r\nto America, and should in one state have remained to the present day.\r\nSome of the early settlements in Virginia were called hundreds, but\r\nthey were practically nothing more than parishes, and the name soon\r\nbecame obsolete, except upon the map, where we still see, for example,\r\nBermuda Hundred. But in Maryland the hundred flourished and became the\r\npolitical unit, like the township in New England. The hundred was the\r\nmilitia district, and the district for the assessment of taxes. In the\r\nearliest times it was also the representative district; delegates\r\nto the colonial legislature sat for hundreds. But in 1654 this was\r\nchanged, and representatives were elected by counties. The officers\r\nof the Maryland hundred were the high constable, the commander of\r\nmilitia, the tobacco-viewer, the overseer of roads, and the assessor\r\nof taxes. The last-mentioned officer was elected by the people, the\r\nothers were all appointed by the governor. The hundred had also its\r\nassembly of all the people, which was in many respects like the New\r\nEngland town-meeting. These hundred-meetings enacted by-laws, levied\r\ntaxes, appointed committees, and often exhibited a vigorous political\r\nlife. But after the Revolution they fell into disuse, and in 1824 the\r\nhundred became extinct in Maryland; its organization was swallowed up\r\nin that of the county.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The hundred in Delaware]\r\n[Sidenote: The levy court, or representative county assembly.]\r\nIn Delaware, however, the hundred remains to this day. There it\r\nis simply an imperfectly developed township, but its relations with\r\nthe county, as they have stood with but little change since 1743,\r\nare very interesting. Each hundred used to choose its own assessor\r\nof taxes, and every year in the month of November the assessors from\r\nall the hundreds used to meet in the county court-house, along with\r\nthree or more justices of the peace and eight grand jurors, and assess\r\nthe taxes for the ensuing year. A month later they assembled again,\r\nto hear complaints from persons who considered themselves overtaxed;\r\nand having disposed of this business, they proceeded to appoint\r\ncollectors, one for each hundred. This county assembly was known as\r\nthe \"court of levy and appeal,\" or more briefly as the levy court.\r\nIt appointed the county treasurer, the road commissioners, and the\r\noverseers of the poor. Since 1793 the levy court has been composed\r\nof special commissioners chosen by popular vote, but its essential\r\ncharacter has not been altered. As a thoroughly representative body,\r\nit reminds one of the county courts of the Plantagenet period.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The old Pennsylvania county.]\r\nWe next come to the great middle colonies, Pennsylvania and New York.\r\nThe most noteworthy feature of local government in Pennsylvania was\r\nthe general election of county officers by popular vote. The county\r\nwas the unit of representation in the colonial legislature, and on\r\nelection days the people of the county elected at the same time their\r\nsheriffs, coroners, assessors, and county commissioners. In this\r\nrespect Pennsylvania furnished a model which has been followed by most\r\nof the states since the Revolution, as regards the county governments.\r\nIt is also to be noted that before the Revolution, as Pennsylvania\r\nincreased in population, the townships began to participate in the\r\nwork of government, each township choosing its overseers of the poor,\r\nhighway surveyors, and inspectors of elections.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Town-meetings were not quite unknown in Pennsylvania;\r\nsee W. P. Holcomb, \"Pennsylvania Boroughs,\" _J. H. U. Studies_,\r\nIV., iv.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Town-meetings in New York.]\r\n[Sidenote: The county board of supervisors.]\r\nNew York had from the very beginning the rudiments of an excellent\r\nsystem of local self-government. The Dutch villages had their\r\nassemblies, which under the English rule were developed into\r\ntown-meetings, though with less ample powers than those of New\r\nEngland. The governing body of the New York town consisted of the\r\nconstable and eight overseers, who answered in most respects to the\r\nselectmen of New England. Four of the overseers were elected each year\r\nin town-meeting, and one of the retiring overseers was at the same\r\ntime elected constable. In course of time the elective offices came\r\nto include assessors and collectors, town clerk, highway surveyors,\r\nfence-viewers, pound-masters, and overseers of the poor. At first\r\nthe town-meetings seem to have been held only for the election of\r\nofficers, but they acquired to a limited extent the power of levying\r\ntaxes and enacting by-laws. In 1703 a law was passed requiring each\r\ntown to elect yearly an officer to be known as the \"supervisor,\" whose\r\nduty was \"to compute, ascertain, examine, oversee, and allow the\r\ncontingent, publick, and necessary charges\" of the county.[4] For\r\nthis purpose the supervisors met once a year at the county town. The\r\nprinciple was the same as that of the levy court in Delaware. This\r\nboard of supervisors was a strictly representative government, and\r\nformed a strong contrast to the close corporation by which county\r\naffairs were administered in Virginia. The New York system is\r\nof especial interest, because it has powerfully influenced the\r\ndevelopment of local institutions throughout the Northwest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Howard, _Local Const.

Thus Virginians and\r\nNorth Carolinians, crossing the Alleghanies, settled Kentucky and\r\nTennessee; thus people from New England filled up the central and\r\nnorthern parts of New York, and passed on into Michigan and Wisconsin;\r\nthus Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois received many settlers from New York\r\nand Pennsylvania. In the early times when Kentucky was settled, the\r\npioneer would select a piece of land wherever he liked, and after\r\nhaving a rude survey made, and the limits marked by \"blazing\" the\r\ntrees with a hatchet, the survey would be put on record in the state\r\nland-office. So little care was taken that half a dozen patents would\r\nsometimes be given for the same tract. Pieces of land, of all shapes\r\nand sizes, lay between the patents.... Such a system naturally begat\r\nno end of litigation, and there remain in Kentucky curious vestiges of\r\nit to this day. [5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Hinsdale, _Old Northwest_, p. 261.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Method of surveying the public lands.]\r\n[Sidenote: Origins of Western townships.]\r\nIn order to avoid such confusion in the settlement of the territory\r\nnorth of the Ohio river, Congress passed the land-ordinance of 1785,\r\nwhich was based chiefly upon the suggestions of Thomas Jefferson, and\r\nlaid the foundation of our simple and excellent system for surveying\r\nnational lands. According to this system as gradually perfected, the\r\ngovernment surveyors first mark out a north and south line which is\r\ncalled the _principal meridian_. Twenty-four such meridians have been\r\nestablished. The first was the dividing line between Ohio and Indiana;\r\nthe last one runs through Oregon a little to the west of Portland. On\r\neach side of the principal meridian there are marked off subordinate\r\nmeridians called _range [6] Then a true parallel of latitude is drawn,\r\ncrossing these meridians at right angles. It is called the _base line_,\r\nor standard parallel. Eleven such base lines, for example, run across\r\nthe great state of Oregon. Finally, on each side of the base line are\r\ndrawn subordinate parallels called _township lines_, six miles apart,\r\nand numbered north and south from their base line. By these range lines\r\nand township lines the whole land is thus divided into townships just\r\nsix miles square, and the townships are all numbered. Take, for example,\r\nthe township of Deerfield in Michigan. That is the fourth township north\r\nof the base line, and it is in the fifth range east of the first\r\nprincipal meridian. It would be called township number 4 north range 5\r\neast, and was so called before it was settled and received a name.\r\nEvidently one must go 24 miles from the principal meridian, or 18 miles\r\nfrom the base line, in order to enter this township. It is all as simple\r\nas the numbering of streets in Philadelphia.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The following is a diagram of the first principal meridian,\r\nand of the base line running across southern Michigan. A B is the\r\nprincipal meridian; C D is the base line. The figures on the base line\r\nmark the range lines; the figures on the principal meridian mark the\r\ntownship lines. E is township 4 north in range 5 east; F is township 5\r\nsouth in range 4 west; G is township 3 north in range 3 west.\r\n[Illustration] As the intervals between meridians diminish as we go\r\nnorthward, it is sometimes necessary to introduce a correction line, the\r\nnature of which will be seen from the following diagram:--\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF CORRECTION LINE.]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: In Philadelphia the streets for the most part cross each\r\nother at right angles and at equal distances, so that the city is laid\r\nout like a checkerboard. The parallel streets running in one direction\r\nhave names, often taken from trees. Market Street is the central\r\nstreet from which the others are reckoned in both directions according\r\nto the couplet\r\n\r\n  \"Market, Arch, Race, and Vine,\r\n  Chestnut, Walnut, Spruce, and Pine,\" etc.\r\n\r\nThe cross streets are not named but numbered, as First, Second, etc.\r\nThe houses on one side of the street have odd numbers and on the other\r\nside even numbers, as is the general custom in the United States. With\r\neach new block a new century of numbers begins, although there are\r\nseldom more than forty real numbers in a block. For example, the\r\ncorner house on Market Street, just above Fifteenth, is 1501 Market\r\nStreet. At somewhere about 1535 or 1539 you come to Sixteenth Street;\r\nthen there is a break in the numbering, and the next corner house is\r\n1601. So in going along a numbered street, say Fifteenth, from Market,\r\nthe first number will be 1; after passing Arch, 101; after passing\r\nRace, 201, etc. With this system a very slight familiarity with the\r\ncity enables one to find his way to any house, and to estimate the\r\nlength of time needful for reaching it. St. Louis and some other large\r\ncities have adopted the Philadelphia plan, the convenience of which\r\nis as great as its monotony. In Washington the streets running in\r\none direction are lettered A, B, C, etc., and the cross streets are\r\nnumbered; and upon the checkerboard plan is superposed another plan in\r\nwhich broad avenues radiate in various directions from the Capitol,\r\nand a few other centres. These avenues cut through the square system\r\nof streets in all directions, so that instead of the dull checkerboard\r\nmonotony there is an almost endless variety of magnificent vistas.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: and of Western counties.]\r\nIf now we look at Livingston County, in which, this township of Deerfield\r\nis situated, we observe that the county is made up of sixteen townships,\r\nin four rows of four; and the next county, Washtenaw, is made up of\r\ntwenty townships, in five rows of four. Maps of our Western states\r\nare thus apt to have somewhat of a checkerboard aspect, not unlike\r\nthe wonderful country which Alice visited after she had gone through\r\nthe looking-glass. Square townships are apt to make square or\r\nrectangular counties, and the state, too, is likely to acquire a more\r\nsymmetrical shape.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing could be more unlike the jagged, irregular shape of counties\r\nin Virginia or townships in Massachusetts, which grew up just as it\r\nhappened. The contrast is similar to that between Chicago, with its\r\nstraight streets crossing at right angles, and Boston, or London, with\r\ntheir labyrinths of crooked lanes. For picturesqueness the advantage\r\nis entirely with the irregular city, but for practical convenience it\r\nis quite the other way. So with our western lands the simplicity and\r\nregularity of the system have made it a marvel of convenience for the\r\nsettlers, and doubtless have had much to do with the rapidity with\r\nwhich civil governments have been built up in the West. \"This fact,\"\r\nsays a recent writer, \"will be appreciated by those who know from\r\nexperience the ease and certainty with which the pioneer on the\r\ngreat plains of Kansas, Nebraska, or Dakota is enabled to select his\r\nhomestead or 'locate his claim' unaided by the expensive skill of the\r\nsurveyor.\" [8]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Howard, _Local Const. Hist. of U. S._, vol. i. p.\r\n139.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some effects of the system.]\r\nThere was more in it than this, however. There was a germ of\r\norganization planted in these western townships, which must be noted\r\nas of great importance. Each township, being six miles in length and\r\nsix miles in breadth, was divided into thirty-six numbered sections,\r\neach containing just one square mile, or 640 acres. Each section,\r\nmoreover, was divided into 16 tracts of 40 acres each, and sales to\r\nsettlers were and are generally made by tracts at the rate of a dollar\r\nand a quarter per acre. For fifty dollars a man may buy forty acres of\r\nunsettled land, provided he will actually go and settle upon it, and\r\nthis has proved to be a very effective inducement for enterprising\r\nyoung men to \"go West.\" Many a tract thus bought for fifty dollars has\r\nturned out to be a soil upon which princely fortunes have grown. A\r\ntract of forty acres represents to-day in Chicago or Minneapolis an\r\namount of wealth difficult for the imagination to grasp.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The reservation for public schools.]\r\n[Sidenote: In this reservation there were the germs of township\r\ngovernment.]\r\nBut in each of these townships there was at least one section which\r\nwas set apart for a special purpose. This was usually the sixteenth\r\nsection, nearly in the centre of the township; and sometimes the\r\nthirty-sixth section, in the southeast corner, was also reserved.\r\nThese reservations were for the support of public schools. Whatever\r\nmoney was earned, by selling the land or otherwise, in these sections,\r\nwas to be devoted to school purposes. This was a most remarkable\r\nprovision. No other nation has ever made a gift for schools on so\r\nmagnificent a scale. We have good reason for taking pride in such a\r\nliberal provision. But we ought not to forget that all national\r\ngifts really involve taxation, and this is no exception to the rule,\r\nalthough in this case it is not a taking of money, but a keeping of it\r\nback. The national government says to the local government, whatever\r\nrevenues may come from that section of 640 acres, be they great or\r\nsmall, be it a spot in a rural grazing district, or a spot in some\r\ncrowded city, are not to go into the pockets of individual men and\r\nwomen, but are to be reserved for public purposes. This is a case of\r\ndisguised taxation, and may serve to remind us of what was said some\r\ntime ago, that a government _cannot_ give anything without in one\r\nway or another depriving individuals of its equivalent. No man can sit\r\non a camp-stool and by any amount of tugging at that camp-stool lift\r\nhimself over a fence. Whatever is given comes from somewhere,\r\nand whatever is given by governments comes from the people. This\r\nreservation of one square mile in every township for purposes of\r\neducation has already most profoundly influenced the development of\r\nlocal government in our western states, and in the near future its\r\neffects are likely to become still deeper and wider. To mark out a\r\ntownship on the map may mean very little, but when once you create in\r\nthat township some institution that needs to be cared for, you have\r\nmade a long stride toward inaugurating township government. When\r\na state, as for instance Illinois, grows up after the method just\r\ndescribed, what can be more natural than for it to make the township a\r\nbody corporate for school purposes, and to authorize its inhabitants\r\nto elect school officers and tax themselves, so far as may be\r\nnecessary, for the support of the schools? But the school-house,\r\nin the centre of the township, is soon found to be useful for many\r\npurposes. It is convenient to go there to vote for state officers or\r\nfor congressmen and president, and so the school township becomes an\r\nelection district. Having once established such a centre, it is almost\r\ninevitable that it should sooner or later be made to serve sundry\r\nother purposes, and become an area for the election of constables,\r\njustices of the peace, highway surveyors, and overseers of the poor.\r\nIn this way a vigorous township government tends to grow up about the\r\nschool-house as a nucleus, somewhat as in early New England it grew up\r\nabout the church.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At first the county system prevailed.]\r\nThis tendency may be observed in almost all the western states and\r\nterritories, even to the Pacific coast. When the western country was\r\nfirst settled, representative county government prevailed almost\r\neverywhere. This was partly because the earliest settlers of the West\r\ncame in much greater numbers from the middle and southern states than\r\nfrom New England. It was also partly because, so long as the country\r\nwas thinly settled, the number of people in a township was very small,\r\nand it was not easy to have a government smaller than that of the\r\ncounty. It was something, however, that the little squares on the\r\nmap, by grouping which the counties were made, were already called\r\ntownships. There is much in a name. It was still more important that\r\nthese townships were only six miles square; for that made it sure\r\nthat, in due course of time, when population should have become dense\r\nenough, they would be convenient areas for establishing township\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

This was twelve years before Michigan became a\r\nstate. At first the powers of the town-meeting were narrowly\r\nlimited. It elected the town and county officers, but its power of\r\nappropriating money seems to have been restricted to the purpose\r\nof extirpating noxious animals and weeds. In 1827, however, it was\r\nauthorized to raise money for the support of schools, and since then\r\nits powers have steadily increased, until now they approach those of\r\nthe town-meeting in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: \"Of the 496 members of the Michigan Pioneer Association\r\nin 1881, 407 are from these sections\" [New England and New York].\r\nBemis, _Local Government in Michigan and the Northwest_, J. H. U.\r\nStudies, I., v]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Settlement of Illinois.]\r\nThe history of Illinois presents an extremely interesting example of\r\nrivalry and conflict between the town system of New England and the\r\ncounty system of the South. Observe that this great state is so long\r\nthat, while the parallel of latitude starting from its northern\r\nboundary runs through Marblehead in Massachusetts, the parallel\r\nthrough its southernmost point, at Cairo, runs a little south of\r\nPetersburg in Virginia. In 1818, when Illinois framed its state\r\ngovernment and was admitted to the Union, its population was chiefly\r\nin the southern half, and composed for the most part of pioneers from\r\nVirginia and Virginia's daughter-state Kentucky. These men brought\r\nwith them the old Virginia county system, but with the very great\r\ndifference that the county officers were not appointed by the\r\ngovernor, or allowed to be a self-perpetuating board, but were elected\r\nby the people of the county. This was a true advance in the democratic\r\ndirection, but an essential defect of the southern system remained in\r\nthe absence of any kind of local meeting for the discussion of public\r\naffairs and the enactment of local laws.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Effects of the Ordinance of 1787.]\r\nBy the famous Ordinance of 1787, to which we shall again have occasion\r\nto refer, negro slavery had been forever prohibited to the north of\r\nthe Ohio river, so that, in spite of the wishes of her early settlers,\r\nIllinois was obliged to enter the Union as a free state. But in 1820\r\nMissouri was admitted as a slave state, and this turned the stream of\r\nsouthern migration aside from Illinois to Missouri. These emigrants,\r\nto whom slaveholding was a mark of social distinction, preferred to\r\ngo where they could own slaves. About the same time settlers from New\r\nEngland and New York, moving along the southern border of Michigan\r\nand the northern borders of Ohio and Indiana, began pouring into\r\nthe northern part of Illinois. These new-comers did not find the\r\nrepresentative county system adequate for their needs, and they\r\ndemanded township government. A memorable political struggle ensued\r\nbetween the northern and southern halves of the state, ending in 1848\r\nwith the adoption of a new constitution. It was provided that the\r\nlegislature should enact a general law for the political organization\r\nof townships, under which any county might act whenever a majority of\r\nits voters should so determine.[10] This was introducing the principle\r\nof local option, and in accordance therewith township governments with\r\ntown-meetings were at once introduced in the northern counties of the\r\nstate, while the southern counties kept on in the old way. Now comes\r\nthe most interesting part of the story. The two systems being thus\r\nbrought into immediate contact in the same state, with free choice\r\nbetween them left to the people, the northern system has slowly but\r\nsteadily supplanted the southern system, until at the present day only\r\none fifth part of the counties in Illinois remain without township\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Shaw, _Local Government if Illinois_, J. H. U.\r\nStudies, I., iii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intense vitality of the township system.]\r\nThis example shows the intense vitality of the township system. It is\r\nthe kind of government that people are sure to prefer when they\r\nhave tried it under favourable conditions. In the West the hostile\r\nconditions against which it has to contend are either the recent\r\nexistence of negro slavery and the ingrained prejudice in favour of\r\nthe Virginia method, as in Missouri; or simply the sparseness of\r\npopulation, as in Nebraska. Time will evidently remove the latter\r\nobstacle, and probably the former also. It is very significant that in\r\nMissouri, which began so lately as 1879 to erect township governments\r\nunder a local option law similar to that of Illinois, the process\r\nhas already extended over about one sixth part of the state; and in\r\nNebraska, where the same process began in 1883, it has covered nearly\r\none third of the organized counties of the state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: County option and township option.]\r\nThe principle of local option as to government has been carried still\r\nfarther in Minnesota and Dakota. The method just described may be\r\ncalled county option; the question is decided by a majority vote of\r\nthe people of the county. But in Minnesota in 1878 it was enacted that\r\nas soon as any one of the little square townships in that state should\r\ncontain as many as twenty-five legal voters, it might petition the\r\nboard of county commissioners and obtain a township organization, even\r\nthough, the adjacent townships in the same county should remain under\r\ncounty government only. Five years later the same provision was\r\nadopted by Dakota, and under it township government is steadily\r\nspreading.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Grades of township government.]\r\nTwo distinct grades of township government are to be observed in the\r\nstates west of the Alleghanies; the one has the town-meeting for\r\ndeliberative purposes, the other has not. In Ohio and Indiana, which\r\nderived their local institutions largely from Pennsylvania, there is\r\nno such town-meeting, the administrative offices are more or less\r\nconcentrated in a board of trustees, and the town is quite subordinate\r\nto the county. The principal features of this system have been\r\nreproduced in Iowa, Missouri, and Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe other system, was that which we have seen beginning in\r\nMichigan, under the influence of New York and New England. Here the\r\ntown-meeting, with legislative powers, is always present. The most\r\nnoticeable feature of the Michigan system is the relation between\r\ntownship and county, which was taken from New York. The county board\r\nis composed of the supervisors of the several townships, and thus\r\nrepresents the townships. It is the same in Illinois. It is held\r\nby some writers that this is the most perfect form of local\r\ngovernment,[11] but on the other hand the objection is made that county\r\nboards thus constituted are too large.[12] We have seen that in the\r\nstates in question there are not less than 16, and sometimes more than\r\n20, townships in each county. In a board of 16 or 20 members it is\r\nhard to fasten responsibility upon anybody in particular; and thus\r\nit becomes possible to have \"combinations,\" and to indulge in that\r\nexchange of favours known as \"log-rolling,\" which is one of the\r\nbesetting sins of all large representative bodies. Responsibility\r\nis more concentrated in the smaller county boards of Massachusetts,\r\nWisconsin, and Minnesota.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Howard, _Local Const. Hist._, passim.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Bemis, _Local Government in Michigan_, J. H. U.\r\nStudies, I., v.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An excellent result of the absence of centralization in the\r\nUnited States.]\r\nIt is one signal merit of the peaceful and untrammelled way in which\r\nAmerican institutions have grown up, the widest possible scope being\r\nallowed to individual and local preferences, that different states\r\nadopt different methods of attaining the great end at which all are\r\naiming in common,--good government. One part of our vast country can\r\nprofit by the experience of other parts, and if any system or method\r\nthus comes to prevail everywhere in the long run, it is likely to\r\nbe by reason of its intrinsic excellence. Our country affords an\r\nadmirable field for the study of the general principles which lie at\r\nthe foundations of universal history. Governments, large and small,\r\nare growing up all about us, and in such wise that we can watch\r\nthe processes of growth, and learn lessons which, after making due\r\nallowances for difference of circumstance, are very helpful in the\r\nstudy of other times and countries.\r\n\r\nThe general tendency toward the spread of township government in the\r\nmore recently settled parts of the United States is unmistakable, and\r\nI have already remarked upon the influence of the public school system\r\nin aiding this tendency. The school district, as a preparation for\r\nthe self-governing township, is already exerting its influence in\r\nColorado, Nevada, California, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, and\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Township government is germinating in the South.]\r\nSomething similar is going on in the southern states, as already\r\nhinted in the case of South Carolina. Local taxation for school\r\npurposes has also been established in Kentucky and Tennessee, in both\r\nVirginias, and elsewhere. There has thus begun a most natural and\r\nwholesome movement, which might easily be checked, with disastrous\r\nresults, by the injudicious appropriation of national revenue for\r\nthe aid of southern schools. It is to be hoped that throughout the\r\nsouthern, states, as formerly in Michigan, the self-governing school\r\ndistrict may prepare the way for the self-governing township, with its\r\ndeliberative town-meeting. Such a growth must needs be slow, inasmuch\r\nas it requires long political training on the part of the negroes and\r\nthe lower classes of white people; but it is along such a line of\r\ndevelopment that such political training can best be acquired; and in\r\nno other way is complete harmony between the two races so likely to be\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: woman suffrage.]\r\nDr. Edward Bemis, who in a profoundly interesting essay[13] has called\r\nattention to this function of the school district as a stage in the\r\nevolution of the township, remarks also upon the fact that \"it is in\r\nthe local government of the school district that woman suffrage is\r\nbeing tried.\" In several states women may vote for school committees,\r\nor may be elected to school committees, or to sundry administrative\r\nschool offices. At present (1894) there are not less than twenty-one\r\nstates in which women have school suffrage. In Colorado and Wyoming\r\nwomen have full suffrage, voting at municipal, state, and\r\nnational elections. In Kansas they have municipal suffrage, and a\r\nconstitutional amendment granting them full suffrage is now awaiting\r\nratification. In England, it may be observed, unmarried women and\r\nwidows who pay taxes vote not only on school matters, but generally in\r\nthe local elections of vestries, boroughs, and poor-law unions. In\r\nthe new Parish Councils Bill this municipal suffrage is extended\r\nto married women. In the Isle of Man women vote for members of\r\nParliament. In Australia they have long had municipal suffrage, and in\r\n1893 they were endowed with full rights of suffrage in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Local Government in Michigan and the Northwest, J.H.U.\r\nStudies, I., v.]\r\n\r\nThe historical reason why the suffrage has so generally been\r\nrestricted to men is perhaps to be sought in the conditions under\r\nwhich voting originated. In primeval times voting was probably adopted\r\nas a substitute for fighting. The smaller and presumably weaker party\r\nyielded to the larger without an actual trial of physical strength;\r\nheads were counted instead of being broken. Accordingly it was only\r\nthe warriors who became voters. The restriction of political activity\r\nto men has also probably been emphasized by the fact that all the\r\nhigher civilizations have passed through a well-defined patriarchal\r\nstage of society in which each household was represented by its\r\noldest warrior. From present indications it would seem that under the\r\nconditions of modern industrial society the arrangements that have so\r\nlong subsisted are likely to be very essentially altered.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

Indeed, the teacher\r\nmay be pardoned if now and then he finds it difficult himself to\r\nanswer a question,--particularly if it is framed to provoke thought\r\nrather than lead to a conclusion, or if it is better fitted for some\r\nother community or part of the country than that in which he lives.\r\nLet him therefore divide the questions among his pupils, or assign to\r\nthem selected questions. In cases that call for special knowledge,\r\nlet the topics go to pupils who may have exceptional facilities for\r\ninformation at home.\r\n\r\nThe important point is not so much the settlement of all the questions\r\nproposed as it is the encouragement of the inquiring and thinking spirit\r\non the part of the pupil.\r\n\r\n1.

In every town-meeting there are leaders,--usually men of character,\r\nability, and means. Do you understand that these men practically have\r\ntheir own way in town affairs,--that the voters as a whole do but little\r\nmore than fall in with the wishes and plans of their leaders? Or is\r\nthere considerable independence in thought and action on the side of the\r\nvoters?\r\n\r\n6. Can a town do what it pleases, or is it limited in its action? If\r\nlimited, by whom or by what is it restricted, and where are the\r\nrestrictions recorded? (Consult the Statutes.)\r\n\r\n7. Why should the majority rule in town-meeting? Suggest, if possible, a\r\nbetter way.\r\n\r\n8. Is it, on the whole, wise that the vote of the poor man shall count\r\nas much as that of the rich, the vote of the ignorant as much as that of\r\nthe intelligent, the vote of the unprincipled as much as that of the\r\nhigh-toned?\r\n\r\n9.

In the former we have direct\r\ngovernment by a primary assembly,[1] the town-meeting; in the latter\r\nwe have indirect government by a representative board. If the county\r\nboard, as in colonial Virginia, perpetuates itself, or is appointed\r\notherwise than by popular vote, it is not strictly a representative\r\nboard, in the modern sense of the phrase; the government is a kind of\r\noligarchy. If, as in colonial Pennsylvania, and in the United States\r\ngenerally to-day, the county board consists of officers elected by\r\nthe people, the county government is a representative democracy. The\r\ntownship government, on the other hand, as exemplified in New England\r\nand in the northwestern states which have adopted it, is a pure\r\ndemocracy. The latter, as we have observed, has one signal advantage\r\nover all other kinds of government, in so far as it tends to make\r\nevery man feel that the business of government is part of his own\r\nbusiness, and that where he has a stake in the management of public\r\naffairs he has also a voice. When people have got into the habit of\r\nleaving local affairs to be managed by representative boards, their\r\nactive interest in local affairs is liable to be somewhat weakened, as\r\nall energies in this world are weakened, from want of exercise. When\r\nsome fit subject of complaint is brought up, the individual is too apt\r\nto feel that it is none of his business to furnish a remedy, let the\r\nproper officers look after it. He can vote at elections, which is a\r\npower; he can perhaps make a stir in the newspapers, which is also a\r\npower; but personal participation in town-meeting is likewise a\r\npower, the necessary loss of which, as we pass to wider spheres of\r\ngovernment, is unquestionably to be regretted.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A primary assembly is one in which the members attend of\r\ntheir own right, without having been elected to it; a representative\r\nassembly is composed of elected delegates.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Direct government impossible in a county.]\r\nNevertheless the loss is inevitable. A primary assembly of all the\r\ninhabitants of a county, for purposes of local government, is out\r\nof the question. There must be representative government, for this\r\npurpose the county system, an inheritance from the ancient English\r\nshire, has furnished the needful machinery. Our county government is\r\nnear enough to the people to be kept in general from gross abuses of\r\npower. There are many points which can be much better decided in\r\nsmall representative bodies than in large miscellaneous meetings. The\r\nresponsibility of our local boards has been fairly well preserved. The\r\ncounty system has had no mean share in keeping alive the spirit of\r\nlocal independence and self-government among our people. As regards\r\nefficiency of administration, it has achieved commendable success,\r\nexcept in the matter of rural highways; and if our roads are worse\r\nthan those of any other civilized country, that is due not so much\r\nto imperfect administrative methods as to other causes,--such as the\r\nsparseness of population, the fierce extremes of sunshine and frost,\r\nand the fact that since this huge country began to be reclaimed from\r\nthe wilderness, the average voter, who has not travelled in Europe,\r\nknows no more about good roads than he knows about the temples of\r\nPaestum or the pictures of Tintoretto, and therefore does not realize\r\nwhat demands he may reasonably make.\r\n\r\nThis last consideration applies in some degree, no doubt, to the\r\nill-paved and filthy streets which are the first things to arrest\r\none's attention in most of our great cities. It is time for us now to\r\nconsider briefly our general system of city government, in its origin\r\nand in some of its most important features.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Boston town-meeting in 1820.]\r\nRepresentative government in counties is necessitated by the extent of\r\nterritory covered; in cities it is necessitated by the multitude\r\nof people. When the town comes to have a very large population, it\r\nbecomes physically impossible to have town-meetings. No way could be\r\ndevised by which all the taxpayers of the city of New York could be\r\nassembled for discussion. In 1820 the population of Boston was about\r\n40,000, of whom rather more than 7,000 were voters qualified to attend\r\nthe town-meetings. Consequently when a town-meeting was held on any\r\nexciting subject in Faneuil Hall, those only who obtained places near\r\nthe moderator could even hear the discussion. A few busy or interested\r\nindividuals easily obtained the management of the most important\r\naffairs in an assembly in which the greater number could have neither\r\nvoice nor hearing. When the subject was not generally exciting,\r\ntown-meetings were usually composed of the selectmen, the town\r\nofficers, and thirty or forty inhabitants. Those who thus came were\r\nfor the most part drawn to it from some official duty or private\r\ninterest, which, when performed or attained, they generally troubled\r\nthemselves but little, or not at all, about the other business of the\r\nmeeting.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Quincy's _Municipal History of Boston_, p. 28.]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it was found necessary in 1822 to drop\r\nthe town-meeting altogether and devise a new form of government for\r\nBoston. After various plans had been suggested and discussed, it was\r\ndecided that the new government should be vested in a Mayor; a select\r\ncouncil of eight persons to be called the Board of Aldermen; and a\r\nCommon Council of forty-eight persons, four from each of twelve wards\r\ninto which the city was to be divided. All these officials were to be\r\nelected by the people. At the same time the official name \"Town of\r\nBoston\" was changed to \"City of Boston.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Distinctions between towns and cities.]\r\nThere is more or less of history involved in these offices and\r\ndesignations, to which we may devote a few words of explanation. In\r\nNew England local usage there is an ambiguity in the word \"town.\"\r\nAs an official designation it means the inhabitants of a township\r\nconsidered as a community or corporate body. In common parlance it\r\noften means the patch of land constituting the township on the map, as\r\nwhen we say that Squire Brown's elm is \"the biggest tree in town.\" But\r\nit still oftener means a collection of streets, houses, and families\r\ntoo large to be called a village, but without the municipal government\r\nthat characterizes a city. Sometimes it is used _par excellence_\r\nfor a city, as when an inhabitant of Cambridge, itself a large\r\nsuburban city, speaks of going to Boston as going \"into town.\" But\r\nsuch cases are of course mere survivals from the time when the suburb\r\nwas a village. In American usage generally the town is something\r\nbetween village and city, a kind of inferior or incomplete city. The\r\nimage which it calls up in the mind is of something urban and not\r\nrural. This agrees substantially with the usage in European history,\r\nwhere \"town\" ordinarily means a walled town or city as contrasted with\r\na village. In England the word is used either in this general sense,\r\nor more specifically as signifying an inferior city, as in America.\r\nBut the thing which the town lacks, as compared with the complete\r\ncity, is very different in America from what it is in England. In\r\nAmerica it is municipal government--with mayor, aldermen, and common\r\ncouncil--which must be added to the town in order to make it a city.\r\nIn England the town may (and usually does) have this municipal\r\ngovernment; but it is not distinguished by the Latin name \"city\"\r\nunless it has a cathedral and a bishop. Or in other words the English\r\ncity is, or has been, the capital of a diocese. Other towns in England\r\nare distinguished as \"boroughs,\" an old Teutonic word which was\r\noriginally applied to towns as _fortified_ places.[3] The voting\r\ninhabitants of an English city are called \"citizens;\" those of\r\na borough are called \"burgesses.\" Thus the official corporate\r\ndesignation of Cambridge is \"the mayor, aldermen, and _burgesses_\r\nof Cambridge;\" but Oxford is the seat of a bishopric, and its\r\ncorporate designation is \"the mayor, aldermen, and _citizens_ of\r\nOxford.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The word appears in many town names, such as\r\n_Edinburgh, Scarborough, Canterbury, Bury St. Edmunds_; and\r\non the Continent, as _Hamburg, Cherbourg, Burgos_, etc. In\r\nConnecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota, the name\r\n\"borough\" is applied to a certain class of municipalities with some of\r\nthe powers of cities.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

Distinguish between citizens and burgesses in England.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 2. _Origin of English Boroughs and Cities_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Chesters.\"]\r\n[Sidenote: Coalescence of towns to fortified boroughs.]\r\nWhat, then, was the origin of the English borough or city? In the days\r\nwhen Roman legions occupied for a long time certain military stations in\r\nBritain, their camps were apt to become centres of trade and thus to\r\ngrow into cities. Such places were generally known as _casters_ or\r\n_chesters_, from the Latin _castra_, \"camp,\" and there are many of them\r\non the map of England to-day. But these were exceptional cases. As a\r\nrule the origin of the borough was as purely English as its name. We\r\nhave seen that the town was originally the dwelling-place of a\r\nstationary clan, surrounded by palisades or by a dense quickset hedge.\r\nNow where such small enclosed places were thinly scattered about they\r\ndeveloped simply into villages. But where, through the development of\r\ntrade or any other cause, a good many of them grew up close together\r\nwithin a narrow compass, they gradually coalesced into a kind of\r\ncompound town; and with the greater population and greater wealth, there\r\nwas naturally more elaborate and permanent fortification than that of\r\nthe palisaded village. There were massive walls and frowning turrets,\r\nand the place came to be called a fortress or \"borough.\" The borough,\r\nthen, was simply several townships packed tightly together; a hundred\r\nsmaller in extent and thicker in population than other hundreds.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Freeman, _Norman Conquest_, vol. v. p. 466. For a\r\ndescription of the _hundred_, see above, pp. 75-80.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The borough as a hundred.]\r\nFrom this compact and composite character of the borough came several\r\nimportant results. We have seen that the hundred was the smallest area\r\nfor the administration of justice. The township was in many respects\r\nself-governing, but it did not have its court, any more than the New\r\nEngland township of the present day has its court. The lowest court\r\nwas that of the hundred, but as the borough was equivalent to a\r\nhundred it soon came to have its own court. And although much\r\nobscurity still surrounds the early history of municipal government in\r\nEngland, it is probable that this court was a representative board,\r\nlike any other hundred court, and that the relation of the borough to\r\nits constituent townships resembled the relation of the modern city to\r\nits constituent wards.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The borough as a county.]\r\nBut now as certain boroughs grew larger and annexed outlying\r\ntownships, or acquired adjacent territory which presently became\r\ncovered with streets and houses, their constitution became still more\r\ncomplex. The borough came to embrace several closely packed hundreds,\r\nand thus became analogous to a shire. In this way it gained for itself\r\na sheriff and the equivalent of a county court. For example, under the\r\ncharter granted by Henry I. in 1101, London was expressly recognized\r\nas a county by itself. Its burgesses could elect their own chief\r\nmagistrate, who was called the port-reeve, inasmuch as London is a\r\nseaport; in some other towns he was called the borough-reeve. He was\r\nat once the chief executive officer and the chief judge. The burgesses\r\ncould also elect their sheriff, although in all rural counties Henry's\r\nfather, William the Conqueror, had lately deprived the people of\r\nthis privilege and appointed the sheriffs himself. London had its\r\nrepresentative board, or council, which was the equivalent of a county\r\ncourt. Each ward, moreover, had its own representative board, which\r\nwas the equivalent of a hundred court. Within the wards, or hundreds,\r\nthe burgesses were grouped together in township, parish, or manor....\r\nInto the civic organization of London, to whose special privileges\r\nall lesser cities were ever striving to attain, the elements of local\r\nadministration embodied in the township, the hundred, and the shire\r\nthus entered as component parts.[5] Constitutionally, therefore,\r\nLondon was a little world in itself, and in a less degree the same was\r\ntrue of other cities and boroughs which afterwards obtained the same\r\nkind of organization, as for example, York and Newcastle, Lincoln and\r\nNorwich, Southampton and Bristol.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Hannis Taylor, _Origin and Growth of the English\r\nConstitution_, vol. i. p. 458.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The guilds.]\r\n[Sidenote: mayor, aldermen, and common council.]\r\nIn such boroughs or cities all classes of society were brought into\r\nclose contact,--barons and knights, priests and monks, merchants and\r\ncraftsmen, free labourers and serfs. But trades and manufactures,\r\nwhich always had so much to do with the growth of the city, acquired\r\nthe chief power and the control of the government. From an early\r\nperiod tradesmen and artisans found it worth while to form themselves\r\ninto guilds or brotherhoods, in order to protect their persons and\r\nproperty against insult and robbery at the hands of great lords and\r\ntheir lawless military retainers. Thus there came to be guilds, or\r\n\"worshipful companies,\" of grocers, fishmongers, butchers, weavers,\r\ntailors, ironmongers, carpenters, saddlers, armourers, needle-makers,\r\netc. In large towns there was a tendency among such trade guilds\r\nto combine in a \"united brotherhood,\" or \"town guild,\" and this\r\norganization at length acquired full control of the city government.\r\nIn London this process was completed in the course of the thirteenth\r\ncentury. To obtain the full privileges of citizenship one had to\r\nbe enrolled in a guild. The guild hall became the city hall. The\r\n_aldermen_, or head men of sundry guilds, became the head men\r\nof the several wards. There was a representative board, or _common\r\ncouncil_, elected by the citizens. The aldermen and common council\r\nheld their meetings in the Guildhall, and over these meetings presided\r\nthe chief magistrate, or port-reeve, who by this time, in accordance\r\nwith the fashion then prevailing, had assumed the French title of\r\n_mayor_. As London had come to be a little world in itself,\r\nso this city government reproduced on a small scale the national\r\ngovernment; the mayor answering to the king, the aristocratic board of\r\naldermen to the House of Lords, and the democratic common council to\r\nthe House of Commons. A still more suggestive comparison, perhaps,\r\nwould be between the aldermen and our federal Senate, since the\r\naldermen represented wards, while the common council represented the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The city of London.]\r\nThe constitution thus perfected in the city of London[6] six hundred\r\nyears ago has remained to this day without essential change. The voters\r\nare enrolled members of companies which represent the ancient guilds.\r\nEach year they choose one of the aldermen to be lord mayor. Within the\r\ncity he has precedence next to the sovereign and before the royal\r\nfamily; elsewhere he ranks as an earl, thus indicating the equivalence\r\nof the city to a county, and with like significance he is lord\r\nlieutenant of the city and justice of the peace. The twenty-six\r\naldermen, one for each ward, are elected by the people, such as are\r\nentitled to vote for members of parliament; they are justices of the\r\npeace. The common councilmen, 206 in number, are also elected by the\r\npeople, and their legislative power within the city is practically\r\nsupreme; parliament does not think of overruling it. And the city\r\ngovernment thus constituted is one of the most clean-handed and\r\nefficient in the world.[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: The city of London extends east and west from the Tower\r\nto Temple Bar, and north and south from Finsbury to the Thames, with\r\na population of not more than 100,000, and is but a small part of the\r\nenormous metropolitan area now known as London, which is a circle of\r\ntwelve miles radius in every direction from its centre at Charing\r\nCross, with a population of more than 5,000,000. This vast area is an\r\nagglomeration of many parishes, manors, etc., and has no municipal\r\ngovernment in common.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Loftie, _History of London _, vol. i. p. 446]\r\n[Sidenote: English cities, the bulwarks of liberty.]\r\n\r\nThe development of other English cities and boroughs was so far like\r\nthat of London that merchant guilds generally obtained control, and\r\ngovernment by mayor, aldermen, and common council came to be the\r\nprevailing type. Having also their own judges and sheriffs, and not\r\nbeing obliged to go outside of their own walls to obtain justice, to\r\nenforce contracts and punish crime, their efficiency as independent\r\nself-governing bodies was great, and in many a troubled time they\r\nserved as staunch bulwarks of English liberty. The strength of their\r\nturreted walls was more than supplemented by the length of their\r\npurses, and such immunity from the encroachments of lords and king\r\nas they could not otherwise win, they contrived to buy. Arbitrary\r\ntaxation they generally escaped by compounding with the royal\r\nexchequer in a fixed sum or quit-rent, known as the _firma\r\nburgi_. We have observed the especial privilege which Henry I.\r\nconfirmed to London, of electing its own sheriff. London had been\r\nprompt in recognizing his title to the crown, and such support, in\r\ndays when the succession was not well regulated, no prudent king could\r\nafford to pass by without some substantial acknowledgment. It was\r\nnever safe for any king to trespass upon the liberties of London, and\r\nthrough the worst times that city has remained a true republic with\r\nliberal republican sentiments. If George III. could have been guided\r\nby the advice of London, as expressed by its great alderman Beckford,\r\nthe American colonies would not have been driven into rebellion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Simon de Montfort and the cities.]\r\nThe most signal part played by the English boroughs and cities, in\r\nsecuring English freedom, dates from the thirteenth century, when\r\nthe nation was vaguely struggling for representative government on a\r\nnational scale, as a means of curbing the power of the crown. In that\r\nmemorable struggle, the issue of which to some extent prefigured\r\nthe shape that the government of the United States was to take five\r\nhundred years afterward, the cities and boroughs supported Simon de\r\nMontfort, the leader of the popular party and one of the foremost\r\namong the heroes and martyrs of English liberty. Accordingly on the\r\nmorrow of his decisive victory at Lewes in 1264, when for the moment\r\nhe stood master of England, as Cromwell stood four centuries later\r\nSimon called a parliament to settle the affairs of the kingdom, and\r\nto this parliament he invited, along with the lords who came by\r\nhereditary custom, not only two elected representatives from each\r\nrural county, but also two elected representatives from each city and\r\nborough. In this parliament, which met in 1265, the combination of\r\nrural with urban representatives brought all parts of England together\r\nin a grand representative body, the House of Commons, with interests\r\nin common; and thus the people presently gained power enough to defeat\r\nall attempts to establish irresponsible government, such as we call\r\ndespotism, on the part of the crown.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Oligarchical abuses in English cities (cir. 1500-1835).]\r\nIf we look at the later history of English cities and boroughs, it\r\nappears that, in spite of the splendid work which they did for the\r\nEnglish people at large, they did not always succeed in preserving\r\ntheir own liberties unimpaired. London, indeed, has always maintained\r\nits character as a truly representative republic. But in many English\r\ncities, during the Tudor and Stuart periods, the mayor and aldermen\r\ncontrived to dispense with popular election, and thus to become close\r\ncorporations or self-perpetuating oligarchical bodies. There was a\r\nnotable tendency toward this sort of irresponsible government in\r\nthe reign of James I., and the Puritans who came to the shores of\r\nMassachusetts Bay were inspired with a feeling of revolt against such\r\nmethods. This doubtless lent an emphasis to the mood in which they\r\nproceeded to organize themselves into free self-governing townships.\r\nThe oligarchical abuses in English cities and boroughs remained until\r\nthey were swept away by the great Municipal Reform Act of 1835.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Government of the city of New York (1686-1821).]\r\nThe first city governments established in America were framed in\r\nconscious imitation of the corresponding institutions in England.\r\nThe oldest city government in the United States is that of New York.\r\nShortly after the town was taken from the Dutch in 1664, the new\r\ngovernor, Colonel Nichols, put an end to its Dutch form of government,\r\nand appointed a mayor, five aldermen, and a sheriff. These officers\r\nappointed inferior officers, such as constables, and little or nothing\r\nwas left to popular election. But in 1686, under Governor Dongan,\r\nNew York was regularly incorporated and chartered as a city. Its\r\nconstitution bore an especially close resemblance to that of Norwich,\r\nthen the third city in England in size and importance. The city of New\r\nYork was divided into six wards. The governing corporation consisted\r\nof the mayor, the recorder, the town-clerk, six aldermen, and six\r\nassistants. All the land not taken up by individual owners was granted\r\nas public land to the corporation, which in return paid into the\r\nBritish exchequer one beaver-skin yearly. This was a survival of the\r\nold quit-rent or _firma burgi_.[8] The city was made a county,\r\nand thus had its court, its sheriff and coroner, and its high\r\nconstable. Other officers were the chamberlain or treasurer, seven\r\ninferior constables, a sergeant-at-arms, and a clerk of the market,\r\nwho inspected weights and measures, and punished delinquencies in the\r\nuse of them. The principal judge was the recorder, who, as we have\r\njust seen, was one of the corporation. The aldermen, assistants, and\r\nconstables were elected annually by the people; but the mayor and\r\nsheriff were appointed by the governor. The recorder, town-clerk, and\r\nclerk of the market were to be appointed by the king, but in case\r\nthe king neglected to act, these appointments also were made by the\r\ngovernor. The high constable was appointed by the mayor, the treasurer\r\nby the mayor, aldermen, and assistants, who seem to have answered\r\nto the ordinary common council. The mayor, recorder, and aldermen,\r\nwithout the assistants, were a judicial body, and held a weekly court\r\nof common pleas. When the assistants were added, the whole became a\r\nlegislative body empowered to enact by-laws.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Jameson, \"The Municipal Government of New York,\" _Mag.\r\nAmer. Hist_., vol. viii. p. 609.]\r\n\r\nAlthough this charter granted very imperfect powers of\r\nself-government, the people contrived to live under it for a hundred\r\nand thirty-five years, until 1821. Before the Revolution their\r\npetitions succeeded in obtaining only a few unimportant amendments.[9]\r\nWhen the British army captured the city in September, 1776, it was\r\nforthwith placed under martial law, and so remained until the army\r\ndeparted in November, 1783. During those seven years New York was not\r\naltogether a comfortable place in which to live. After 1783 the city\r\ngovernment remained as before, except that the state of New York\r\nassumed the control formerly exercised by the British crown. Mayor and\r\nrecorder, town-clerk and sheriff, were now appointed by a council of\r\nappointment consisting of the governor and four senators. This did not\r\nwork well, and the constitution of 1821 gave to the people the power\r\nof choosing their sheriff and town-clerk, while the mayor was to be\r\nelected by the common council. Nothing but the appointment of the\r\nrecorder remained in the hands of the governor. Thus nearly forty\r\nyears after the close of the War of Independence the city of New York\r\nacquired self-government as complete as that of the city of London.\r\nIn 1857, as we shall see, this self-government was greatly curtailed,\r\nwith results more or less disastrous.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Especially in the so-called Montgomerie charter of 1730.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: City government in Philadelphia (1701-1789).]\r\nThe next city governments to be organized in the American colonies,\r\nafter that of New York, were those of Philadelphia, incorporated in\r\n1701, and Annapolis, incorporated in 1708. These governments were\r\nframed after the wretched pattern then so common in England. In\r\nboth the mayor, the recorder, the aldermen, and the common council\r\nconstituted a close self-electing corporation. The resulting abuses\r\nwere not so great as in England, probably because the cities were\r\nso small. But in course of time, especially in Philadelphia as it\r\nincreased in population, the viciousness of the system was abundantly\r\nillustrated. As the people could not elect the governing corporation\r\nor any of its members, they very naturally and reasonably distrusted\r\nit, and through the legislature they contrived so to limit its powers\r\nof taxation that it was really unable to keep the streets in repair,\r\nto light them at night, or to support an adequate police force. An\r\nattempt was made to supply such wants by creating divers independent\r\nboards of commissioners, one for paving and draining, another for\r\nstreet-lamps and watchmen, a third for town-pumps, and so on. In this\r\nway responsibility got so minutely parcelled out and scattered, and\r\nthere was so much jealousy and wrangling between the different boards\r\nand the corporation, that the result was chaos. The public money was\r\nhabitually wasted and occasionally embezzled, and there was general\r\ndissatisfaction. In 1789 the close corporation was abolished, and\r\nthereafter the aldermen and common council were elected by the\r\ncitizens, the mayor was chosen by the aldermen out of their own\r\nnumber, and the recorder was appointed by the mayor and aldermen. Thus\r\nPhiladelphia obtained a representative government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Traditions of good government lacking.]\r\nThese instances of New York and Philadelphia sufficiently illustrate\r\nthe beginnings of city government in the United States. In each case\r\nthe system was copied from England at a time when city government\r\nin England was sadly demoralized. What was copied was not the free\r\nrepublic of London, with its noble traditions of civic honour and\r\nsagacious public spirit, but the imperfect republics or oligarchies\r\ninto which the lesser English boroughs were sinking, amid the foul\r\npolitical intrigues and corruption which characterized the Stuart\r\nperiod. The government of American cities in our own time is admitted\r\non all hands to be far from satisfactory. It is interesting to observe\r\nthat the cities which had municipal government before the Revolution,\r\nthough they have always had their full share of able and high-minded\r\ncitizens, do not possess even the tradition of good government. And\r\nthe difficulty, in those colonial times, was plainly want of adequate\r\nself-government, want of responsibility on the part of the public\r\nservants toward their employers the people.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

Why are the traditions of good government lacking in the older\r\nAmerican cities?\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. The Government of Cities in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Several features of our city governments.]\r\nAt the present day American municipal governments are for the most\r\npart constructed on the same general plan, though with many variations\r\nin detail. There is an executive department, with the mayor at its\r\nhead. The mayor is elected voters of the city, and holds office\r\ngenerally for one year, but sometimes for two or three years, and in\r\nSt. Louis and Philadelphia even for four years. Under the mayor are\r\nvarious heads of departments,--street commissioners, assessors,\r\noverseers of the poor, etc.,--sometimes elected by the citizens,\r\nsometimes appointed by the mayor or the city council. This city\r\ncouncil Is a legislative body, usually consisting of two chambers, the\r\naldermen and the common council, elected by the citizens; but in many\r\nsmall cities, and a few of the largest,--such as New York, Brooklyn,\r\nChicago, and San Francisco,--there is but one such chamber. Then there\r\nare city judges, sometimes appointed by the governor of the state, to\r\nserve for life or during good behaviour, but usually elected by the\r\ncitizens for short terms.\r\n\r\nAll appropriations of money for city purposes are made by the city\r\ncouncil; and as a general rule this council has some control over the\r\nheads of executive departments, which it exercises through committees.\r\nThus there may be a committee upon streets, upon public buildings,\r\nupon parks or almshouses or whatever the municipal government is\r\nconcerned with. The head of a department is more or less dependent\r\nupon his committee, and in practice this is found to divide and weaken\r\nresponsibility. The heads of departments are apt to be independent of\r\none another, and to owe no allegiance in common to any one. The mayor,\r\nwhen he appoints them, usually does so subject to the approval, of the\r\ncity council or of one branch of it. The mayor is usually not a member\r\nof the city council, but can veto its enactments, which however can be\r\npassed over his veto by a two thirds majority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: They do not seem to work well.]\r\n[Sidenote: some difficulties to be stated.]\r\nCity governments thus constituted are something like state governments\r\nin miniature. The relation of the mayor to the city council is\r\nsomewhat like that of the governor to the state legislature, and of\r\nthe president to the national congress. In theory nothing could well\r\nbe more republican, or more unlike such city governments as those of\r\nNew York and Philadelphia before the Revolution. Yet in practice it\r\ndoes not seem to work well. New York and Philadelphia seem to\r\nhave heard as many complaints in the nineteenth century as in the\r\neighteenth, and the same kind of complaints,--of excessive taxation,\r\npublic money wasted or embezzled, ill-paved and dirty streets,\r\ninefficient police, and so on to the end of the chapter. In most of\r\nour large cities similar evils have been witnessed, and in too many of\r\nthe smaller ones the trouble seems to be the same in kind, only less\r\nin degree. Our republican government, which, after making all due\r\nallowances, seems to work remarkably well in rural districts, and in\r\nthe states, and in the nation, has certainly been far less successful\r\nas applied to cities. Accordingly our cities have come to furnish\r\ntopics for reflection to which writers and orators fond of boasting\r\nthe unapproachable excellence of American institutions do not like to\r\nallude. Fifty years ago we were wont to speak of civil government\r\nin the United States as if it had dropped from heaven or had been\r\nspecially created by some kind of miracle upon American soil; and we\r\nwere apt to think that in mere republican forms there was some kind of\r\nmystic virtue which made them a panacea for all political evils. Our\r\nlater experience with cities has rudely disturbed this too confident\r\nframe of mind. It has furnished facts which do not seem to fit our\r\nself-complacent theory, so that now our writers and speakers are\r\ninclined to vent their spleen upon the unhappy cities, perhaps too\r\nunreservedly. We hear them called \"foul sinks of corruption\" and\r\n\"plague spots on our body politic.\" Yet in all probability our cities\r\nare destined to increase in number and to grow larger and larger; so\r\nthat perhaps it is just as well to consider them calmly, as presenting\r\nproblems which had not been thought of when our general theory of\r\ngovernment was first worked out a hundred years ago, but which, after\r\nwe have been sufficiently taught by experience, we may hope to succeed\r\nin solving, just as we have heretofore succeeded in other things. A\r\ngeneral discussion of the subject does not fall within the province of\r\nthis brief historical sketch. But our account would be very incomplete\r\nif we were to stop short of mentioning some of the recent attempts\r\nthat have been made toward reconstructing our theories of city\r\ngovernment and improving its practical working. And first, let us\r\npoint out a few of the peculiar difficulties of the problem, that we\r\nmay see why we might have been expected, up to the present time,\r\nto have been less successful in managing our great cities than in\r\nmanaging our rural communities, and our states, and our nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rapid growth of American cities.]\r\nIn the first place, the problem is comparatively new and has taken us\r\nunawares. At the time of Washington's inauguration to the presidency\r\nthere were no large cities in the United States. Philadelphia had a\r\npopulation of 42,000; New York had 33,000; Boston, which came next, with\r\n18,000, was not yet a city. Then came Baltimore, with 13,000; while\r\nBrooklyn was a village of 1,600 souls. Now these five cities have a\r\npopulation of more than 4,000,000, or more than that of the United\r\nStates in 1789. And consider how rapidly new cities have been added to\r\nthe list. One hardly needs to mention the most striking cases, such as\r\nChicago, with 4,000 inhabitants in 1840. and at least 1,000,000 in 1890;\r\nor Denver, with its miles of handsome streets and shops, and not one\r\nnative inhabitant who has reached his thirtieth birthday. Such facts are\r\nsummed up in the general statement that, whereas in 1790 the population\r\nof the United States was scarcely 4,000,000, and out of each 100\r\ninhabitants only 3 dwelt in cities and the other 97 in rural places; on\r\nthe other hand in 1880, when the population was more than 50,000,000,\r\nout of each 100 inhabitants 23 dwelt in cities and 77 in rural places.\r\nBut duly to appreciate the rapidity of this growth of cities, we must\r\nobserve that most of it has been subsequent to 1840. In 1790 there were\r\nsix towns in the United States that might be ranked as cities from their\r\nsize, though to get this number we must include Boston. In 1800 the\r\nnumber was the same. By 1810 the number had risen from 6 to 11; by 1820\r\nit had reached 13; by 1830 this thirteen had doubled and become 26; and\r\nin 1840 there were 44 cities altogether. The urban population increased\r\nfrom 210,873 in 1800 to 1,453,994 in 1840. But between 1840 and 1880 the\r\nnumber of new cities which came into existence was 242, and the urban\r\npopulation increased to 11,318,547. Nothing like this was ever known\r\nbefore in any part of the world, and perhaps it is not strange that such\r\na tremendous development did not find our methods of government fully\r\nprepared to deal with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Want of practical foresight.]\r\nThis rapidity of growth has entailed some important consequences. In the\r\nfirst place it obliges the city to make great outlays of money in order\r\nto get immediate results. Public works must be undertaken with a view to\r\nquickness rather than thoroughness. Pavements, sewers, and reservoirs of\r\nsome sort must be had at once, even if inadequately planned and\r\nimperfectly constructed; and so, before a great while, the work must be\r\ndone over again. Such conditions of imperative haste increase the\r\ntemptations to dishonesty as well as the liability to errors of judgment\r\non the part of the men who administer the public funds.[10] Then the\r\nrapid growth of a city, especially of a new city, requiring the\r\nimmediate construction of a certain amount of public works, almost\r\nnecessitates the borrowing of money, and debt means heavy taxes. It is\r\nlike the case of a young man who, in order to secure a home for his\r\nquickly growing family, buys a house under a heavy mortgage. Twice a\r\nyear there comes in a great bill for interest, and in order to meet it\r\nhe must economize in his table or now and then deny himself a new suit\r\nof clothes. So if a city has to tax heavily to pay its debts, it must\r\ncut down its current expenses somewhere, and the results are sure to be\r\nvisible in more or less untidiness and inefficiency. Mr. Low tells us\r\nthat \"very few of our American cities have yet paid in full the cost of\r\ntheir original water-works.\" Lastly, much wastefulness results from want\r\nof foresight. It is not easy to predict how a city will grow, or the\r\nnature of its needs a few years hence. Moreover, even when it is easy\r\nenough to predict a result, it is not easy to secure practical foresight\r\non the part of a city council elected for the current year. Its members\r\nare afraid of making taxes too heavy this year, and considerations of\r\nten years hence are apt to be dismissed as \"visionary.\" It is always\r\nhard for us to realize how terribly soon ten years hence will be here.\r\nThe habit of doing things by halves has been often commented on (and,\r\nperhaps, even more by our own writers than by foreigners) as especially\r\nnoticeable in America. It has doubtless been fostered by the conditions\r\nwhich in so many cases have made it absolutely necessary to adopt\r\ntemporary makeshifts. These conditions have produced a certain habit of\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: This and some of the following considerations have been\r\nably set forth and illustrated by Hon. Seth Low, president of Columbia\r\nCollege, and lately mayor of Brooklyn, in an address at Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity, published in _J. H. U. Studies, Supplementary Notes_,\r\nno. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Growth in complexity of government in cities.]\r\nLet us now observe that as cities increase in size the amount of\r\ngovernment that is necessary tends in some respects to increase.\r\nWherever there is a crowd there is likely to be some need of rules and\r\nregulations. In the country a man may build his house pretty much as he\r\npleases; but in the city he may be forbidden to build it of wood, and\r\nperhaps even the thickness of the party walls or the position of the\r\nchimneys may come in for some supervision on the part of the government.\r\nFor further precaution against spreading fires, the city has an\r\norganized force of men, with costly engines, engine-houses, and stables.\r\nIn the country a board of health has comparatively little to do; in the\r\ncity it is often confronted with difficult sanitary problems which call\r\nfor highly paid professional skill on the part of physicians and\r\nchemists, architects and plumbers, masons and engineers. So, too, the\r\nwater supply of a great city is likely to be a complicated business, and\r\nthe police force may well need as much, management as a small army. In\r\nshort, with a city, increase in size is sure to involve increase in\r\ncomplexity of organization, and this means a vast increase in the number\r\nof officials for doing the work and of details to be superintended. For\r\nexample, let us enumerate the executive department and officers of the\r\ncity of Boston at the present time.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Municipal officers in Boston.]\r\nThere are three street commissioners with power to lay out streets and\r\nassess damages thereby occasioned. These are elected by the people. The\r\nfollowing officers are appointed by the mayor, with the concurrence of\r\nthe aldermen: a superintendent of streets, an inspector of buildings,\r\nthree commissioners each for the fire and health departments, four\r\noverseers of the poor, besides a board of nine directors for the\r\nmanagement of almshouses, houses of correction, lunatic hospital, etc.;\r\na city hospital board of five members, five trustees of the public\r\nlibrary, three commissioners each for parks and water-works; five chief\r\nassessors, to estimate the value of property and assess city, county,\r\nand state taxes; a city collector, a superintendent of public buildings,\r\nfive trustees of Mount Hope Cemetery, six sinking fund commissioners,\r\ntwo record commissioners, three registrars of voters, a registrar of\r\nbirths, deaths, and marriages, a city treasurer, city auditor, city\r\nsolicitor, corporation counsel, city architect, city surveyor,\r\nsuperintendent of Faneuil Hall Market, superintendent of street lights,\r\nsuperintendent of sewers, superintendent of printing, superintendent of\r\nbridges, five directors of ferries, harbour master and ten assistants,\r\nwater registrar, inspector of provisions, inspector of milk and vinegar,\r\na sealer and four deputy sealers of weights and measures, an inspector\r\nof lime, three inspectors of petroleum, fifteen inspectors of pressed\r\nhay, a culler of hoops and staves, three fence-viewers, ten\r\nfield-drivers and pound-keepers, three surveyors of marble, nine\r\nsuperintendents of hay scales, four measurers of upper leather, fifteen\r\nmeasurers of wood and bark, twenty measurers of grain, three weighers of\r\nbeef, thirty-eight weighers of coal, five weighers of boilers and heavy\r\nmachinery, four weighers of ballast and lighters, ninety-two\r\nundertakers, 150 constables, 968 election officers and their deputies. A\r\nfew of these officials serve without pay, some are paid by salaries\r\nfixed by the council, some by fees. Besides these there is a clerk of\r\nthe common council elected by that body, and also the city clerk, city\r\nmessenger, and clerk of committees, in whose election both branches of\r\nthe city council concur. The school committee, of twenty-four members,\r\nelected by the people, is distinct from the rest of the city government,\r\nand so is the board of police, composed of three commissioners appointed\r\nby the state executive.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Bugbee, \"The City Government of Boston,\" _J.H.U.\r\nStudies_, V., iii.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: How city government comes to be a mystery.]\r\nThis long list may serve to give some idea of the mere quantity of\r\nadministrative work required in a large city. Obviously under such\r\ncircumstances city government must become more or less of a mystery to\r\nthe great mass of citizens. They cannot watch its operations as the\r\ninhabitants of a small village can watch the proceedings of their\r\ntownship and county governments. Much work must go on which cannot\r\neven be intelligently criticised without such special knowledge as it\r\nwould be idle to expect in the average voter, or perhaps in any voter.\r\nIt becomes exceedingly difficult for the taxpayer to understand just\r\nwhat his money goes for, or how far the city expenses might reasonably\r\nbe reduced; and it becomes correspondingly easy for municipal\r\ncorruption to start and acquire a considerable headway before it can\r\nbe detected and checked.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In some respects it is more of a mystery that state and\r\nnational government.]\r\nIn some respects city government is harder to watch intelligently\r\nthan the government of the state or of the nation. For these wider\r\ngovernments are to some extent limited to work of general supervision.\r\nAs compared with the city, they are more concerned with the\r\nestablishment and enforcement of certain general principles, and less\r\nwith the administration of endlessly complicated details. I do not\r\nmean to be understood as saying that there is not plenty of intricate\r\ndetail about state and national governments. I am only comparing one\r\nthing with another, and it seems to me that one chief difficulty with\r\ncity government is the bewildering vastness and multifariousness of\r\nthe details with which it is concerned. The modern city has come to be\r\na huge corporation for carrying on a huge business with many branches,\r\nmost of which call for special aptitude and training.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mayor at first had too little power.]\r\nAs these points have gradually forced themselves upon public attention\r\nthere has been a tendency in many of our large cities toward\r\nremodeling their governments on new principles. The most noticeable\r\nfeature of this tendency is the increase in the powers of the mayor.\r\n\r\nA hundred years ago our legislators and constitution-makers were much\r\nafraid of what was called the \"one-man power.\" In nearly all the\r\ncolonies a chronic quarrel had been kept up between the governors\r\nappointed by the king and the legislators elected by the people, and\r\nthis had made the \"one-man power\" very unpopular. Besides, it was\r\nsomething that had been unpopular in ancient Greece and Rome, and it\r\nwas thought to be essentially unrepublican in principle. Accordingly\r\nour great grandfathers preferred to entrust executive powers to\r\ncommittees rather than to single individuals; and when they assigned\r\nan important office to an individual they usually took pains to\r\ncurtail its power and influence. This disposition was visible in our\r\nearly attempts to organize city governments like little republics.\r\nFirst, in the board of aldermen and the common council we had a\r\ntwo-chambered legislature. Then, lest the mayor should become\r\ndangerous, the veto power was at first generally withheld from him,\r\nand his appointments of executive officers needed to be confirmed by\r\nat least one branch of the city council. These executive officers,\r\nmoreover, as already observed, were subject to more or less control or\r\noversight from committees of the city council.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Scattering and weakening of responsibility.]\r\nNow this system, in depriving the mayor of power, deprived him of\r\nresponsibility, and left the responsibility nowhere in particular. In\r\nmaking appointments the mayor and council would come to some sort of\r\ncompromise with each other and exchange favours. Perhaps for private\r\nreasons incompetent or dishonest officers would get appointed, and\r\nif the citizens ventured to complain the mayor would say that he\r\nappointed as good men as the council could be induced to confirm,\r\nand the council would declare their willingness to confirm good\r\nappointments if the mayor could only be persuaded to make them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Committees inefficient for executive purposes.]\r\nThen the want of subordination of the different executive departments\r\nmade it impossible to secure unity of administration or to carry out\r\nany consistent and generally intelligible policy. Between the various\r\nexecutive officers and visiting committees there was apt to be a\r\nmore or less extensive interchange of favours, or what is called\r\n\"log-rolling;\" and sums of money would be voted by the council only\r\nthus to leak away in undertakings the propriety or necessity of which\r\nwas perhaps hard to determine. There was no responsible head who could\r\nbe quickly and sharply called to account. Each official's hands were\r\nso tied that whatever went wrong he could declare that it was not his\r\nfault. The confusion was enhanced by the practice of giving executive\r\nwork to committees or boards instead of single officers. Benjamin\r\nFranklin used to say, if you wish to be sure that a thing is done, go\r\nand do it yourself. Human experience certainly proves that this is the\r\nonly absolutely safe way. The next best way is to send some competent\r\nperson to do it for you; and if there is no one competent to be\r\nhad, you do the next best thing and entrust the work to the least\r\nincompetent person you can find. If you entrust it to a committee your\r\nprospect of getting it done is diminished and it grows less if\r\nyou enlarge your committee. By the time you have got a group of\r\ncommittees, independent of one another and working at cross purposes,\r\nyou have got Dickens's famous Circumlocution Office, where the great\r\nobject in life was \"how not to do it.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote 1: Increase of city debts.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote 2: Attempt to cure the evil by state interference;\r\n experience of New York.]\r\n\r\nAmid the general dissatisfaction over the extravagance and\r\ninefficiency of our city governments, people's attention was first\r\ndrawn to the rapid and alarming increase of city indebtedness in\r\nvarious parts of the country. A heavy debt may ruin a city as surely\r\nas an individual, for it raises the rate of taxation, and thus, as was\r\nabove pointed out, it tends to frighten people and capital away from\r\nthe city. At first it was sought to curb the recklessness of city\r\ncouncils in incurring lavish expenditures by giving the mayor a veto\r\npower. Laws were also passed limiting the amount of debt which a city\r\nwould be allowed to incur under any circumstances. Clothing the\r\nmayor with the veto power is now seen to have been a wise step; and\r\narbitrary limitation of the amount of debt, though a clumsy expedient,\r\nis confessedly a necessary one. But beyond this, it was in some\r\ninstances attempted to take the management of some departments of city\r\nbusiness out of the hands of the city and put them into the hands of\r\nthe state legislature. The most notable instance of this was in New\r\nYork in 1857. The results, there and elsewhere, have been generally\r\nregarded as unsatisfactory. After a trial of thirty years the\r\nexperience of New York has proved that a state legislature is not\r\ncompetent to take proper care of the government of cities. Its\r\nmembers do not know enough about the details of each locality, and\r\nconsequently local affairs are left to the representatives from each\r\nlocality, with \"log-rolling\" as the inevitable result. A man fresh\r\nfrom his farm on the edge of the Adirondacks knows nothing about the\r\nproblems pertaining to electric wires in Broadway, or to rapid transit\r\nbetween Harlem and the Battery; and his consent to desired legislation\r\non such points can very likely be obtained only by favouring some\r\nmeasure which he thinks will improve the value of his farm, or perhaps\r\nby helping him to debauch the civil service by getting some neighbour\r\nappointed to a position for which he is not qualified. All this is\r\nmade worse by the fact that the members of a state government are\r\ngenerally less governed by a sense of responsibility toward the\r\ncitizens of a particular city than even the worst local government\r\nthat can be set up in such a city.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is not intended to deny that there may be instances\r\nin which the state government may advantageously participate in the\r\ngovernment of cities. It may be urged that, in the case of great\r\ncities, like New York or Boston, many people who are not residents\r\neither do business in the city or have vast business interests there,\r\nand thus may be as deeply interested in its welfare as any of the\r\nvoters. It may also be said that state provisions for city government\r\ndo not always work badly. There are many competent judges who approve\r\nof the appointment of police commissioners by the executive of\r\nMassachusetts. There are generally two sides to a question; and to\r\npush a doctrine to extremes is to make oneself a _doctrinaire_\r\nrather than a wise citizen. But experience clearly shows that in all\r\ndoubtful cases it is safer to let the balance incline in favour of\r\nlocal self-government than the other way.]\r\n\r\nMoreover, even if legislatures were otherwise competent to manage the\r\nlocal affairs of cities, they have not time enough, amid the pressure\r\nof other duties, to do justice to such matters. In 1870 the number of\r\nacts passed by the New York legislature was 808. Of these, 212, or\r\nmore than one fourth of the whole, related to cities and villages. The\r\n808 acts, when printed, filled about 2,000 octavo pages; and of these\r\nthe 212 acts filled more than 1,500 pages. This illustrates what\r\nI said above about the vast quantity of details which have to be\r\nregulated in municipal government. Here we have more than three\r\nfourths of the volume of state-legislation devoted to local affairs;\r\nand it hardly need be added that a great part of these enactments were\r\nworse than worthless because they were made hastily and\r\nwithout due consideration,--though not always, perhaps, without what\r\nlawyers call _a_ consideration.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Nothing could be further from my thought than to cast any\r\nspecial imputation upon the New York legislature, which is probably a\r\nfair average specimen of law-making bodies. The theory of legislative\r\nbodies, as laid down in text-books, is that they are assembled for the\r\npurpose of enacting laws for the welfare of the community in\r\ngeneral. In point of fact they seldom rise to such a lofty height of\r\ndisinterestedness. Legislation is usually a mad scramble in which the\r\nfinal result, be it good or bad, gets evolved out of compromises and\r\nbargains among a swarm of clashing local and personal interests.\r\nThe \"consideration\" may be anything from log-rolling to bribery. In\r\nAmerican legislatures it is to be hoped that downright bribery is\r\nrare. As for log-rolling, or exchange of favours, there are many\r\nphases of it in which that which may be perfectly innocent shades\r\noff by almost imperceptible degrees into that which is unseemly or\r\ndishonourable or even criminal; and it is in this hazy region that\r\nSatan likes to set his traps for the unwary pilgrim.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tweed Ring in New York.]\r\nThe experience of New York thus proved that state intervention and\r\nspecial legislation did not mend matters. It did not prevent the\r\nshameful rule of the Tweed Ring from 1868 to 1871, when a small band\r\nof conspirators got themselves elected or appointed to the principal\r\ncity offices, and, having had their own corrupt creatures chosen\r\njudges of the city courts, proceeded to rob the taxpayers at their\r\nleisure. By the time they were discovered and brought to justice,\r\ntheir stealings amounted to many millions of dollars, and the rate of\r\ntaxation had risen to more than two per cent.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New experiments.]\r\nThe discovery of these wholesale robberies, and of other villainies\r\non a smaller scale in other cities, has led to much discussion of the\r\nproblems of municipal government, and to many attempts at practical\r\nreform. The present is especially a period of experiments, yet in\r\nthese experiments perhaps a general drift of opinion may be discerned.\r\nPeople seem to be coming to regard cities more as if they were huge\r\nbusiness corporations than as if they were little republics. The\r\nlesson has been learned that in executive matters too much limitation\r\nof power entails destruction of responsibility; the \"ring\" is now more\r\ndreaded than the \"one-man power;\" and there is accordingly a manifest\r\ntendency to assail the evil by concentrating power and responsibility\r\nin the mayor.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New government of Brooklyn.]\r\nThe first great city to adopt this method was Brooklyn. In the first\r\nplace the city council was simplified and made a one-chambered council\r\nconsisting of nineteen aldermen. Besides this council of aldermen, the\r\npeople elect only three city officers,--the mayor, comptroller,\r\nand auditor. The comptroller is the principal finance officer and\r\nbook-keeper of the city; and the auditor must approve bills against\r\nthe city, whether great or small, before they can be paid. The mayor\r\nappoints, without confirmation by the council, all executive heads of\r\ndepartments; and these executive heads are individuals, not\r\nboards. Thus there is a single police commissioner, a single fire\r\ncommissioner, a single health commissioner, and so on; and each of\r\nthese heads appoints his own subordinates; so that the principle\r\nof defined responsibility permeates the city government from top\r\nto bottom,[14] In a few cases, where the work to be done is rather\r\ndiscretionary than executive in character, it is intrusted to a board;\r\nthus there is a board of assessors, a board of education, and a board\r\nof elections. These are all appointed by the mayor, but for terms\r\nnot coinciding with his own; \"so that, in most cases, no mayor would\r\nappoint the whole of any such board unless he were to be twice elected\r\nby the people.\" But the executive officers are appointed by the mayor\r\nfor terms coincident with his own, that is for two years. \"The mayor\r\nis elected at the general election in November; he takes office on the\r\nfirst of January following, and for one month the great departments of\r\nthe city are carried on for him by the appointees of his predecessor.\r\nOn the first of February it becomes his duty to appoint his own heads\r\nof departments, and thus each incoming mayor has the opportunity to\r\nmake an administration in all its parts in sympathy with himself.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Seth Low on \"Municipal Government,\" in Bryce's\r\n_American Commonwealth_, vol. i. p. 626.]\r\n\r\nWith all these immense executive powers entrusted to the mayor,\r\nhowever, he does not hold the purse-strings. He is a member of a board\r\nof estimate, of which the other four members are the comptroller\r\nand auditor, with the county treasurer and supervisor. This board\r\nrecommends the amounts to be raised by taxation for the ensuing year.\r\nThese estimates are then laid before the council of aldermen, who\r\nmay cut down single items as they see fit, but have not the power to\r\nincrease any item. The mayor must see to it that the administrative\r\nwork of the year does not use up more money than is thus allowed him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Some of its merits.]\r\nThis Brooklyn system has great merits. It ensures unity of\r\nadministration, it encourages promptness and economy, it locates\r\nand defines responsibility, and it is so simple that everybody can\r\nunderstand it. The people, having but few officers to elect, are\r\nmore likely to know something about them. Especially since everybody\r\nunderstands that the success of the government depends upon the\r\ncharacter of the mayor, extraordinary pains are taken to secure good\r\nmayors; and the increased interest in city politics is shown by the\r\nfact that in Brooklyn more people vote for mayor than for governor\r\nor for president. Fifty years ago such a reduction in the number of\r\nelective officers would have greatly shocked all good Americans. But\r\nIn point of fact, while in small townships where everybody knows\r\neverybody popular control is best ensured by electing all public\r\nofficers, it is very different in great cities where it is impossible\r\nthat the voters in general should know much about the qualifications\r\nof a long list of candidates. In such cases citizens are apt to vote\r\nblindly for names about which they know nothing except that they occur\r\non a Republican or a Democratic ticket; although, if the object of\r\na municipal election is simply to secure an upright and efficient\r\nmunicipal government, to elect a city magistrate because he is a\r\nRepublican or a Democrat is about as sensible as to elect him because\r\nhe believes in homoeopathy or has a taste for chrysanthemums.[15] To\r\nvote for candidates whom one has never heard of is not to insure\r\npopular control, but to endanger it. It is much better to vote for\r\none man whose reputation we know, and then to hold him strictly\r\nresponsible for the appointments he makes. The Brooklyn system seems\r\nto be a step toward lifting city government out of the mire of party\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Of course from the point of view of the party politician,\r\nit Is quite different. Each party has its elaborate \"machine\" for\r\nelecting state and national officers; and in order to be kept at\r\nits maximum of efficiency the machine must be kept at work on all\r\noccasions, whether such occasions are properly concerned with\r\ndifferences in party politics or not. To the party politician it\r\nof course makes a great difference whether a city magistrate is a\r\nRepublican or a Democrat. To him even the political complexion of his\r\nmail-carrier is a matter of importance. But these illustrations\r\nonly show that party politics may be carried to extremes that are\r\ninconsistent with the best interests of the community. Once in a while\r\nit becomes necessary to teach party organizations to know their place,\r\nand to remind them that they are not the lords and masters but the\r\nservants and instruments of the people.]\r\n\r\nThis system went into operation in Brooklyn in January, 1882, and\r\nseems to have given general satisfaction. Since then changes in a\r\nsimilar direction, though with variations in detail, have been made in\r\nother cities, and notably in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Notion that the suffrage ought to be restricted.]\r\nIn speaking of the difficulties which beset city government in the\r\nUnited States, mention is often (and perhaps too exclusively) made\r\nof the great mass of ignorant voters, chiefly foreigners without\r\nexperience in self-government, with no comprehension of American\r\nprinciples and traditions, and with little or no property to suffer\r\nfrom excessive taxation. Such people will naturally have slight\r\ncompunctions about voting away other people's money; indeed, they are\r\napt to think that \"the Government\" has got Aladdin's lamp hidden away\r\nsomewhere in a burglar-proof safe, and could do pretty much everything\r\nthat is wanted, if it only would. In the hands of demagogues such\r\npeople may be dangerous, they are supposed to be especially accessible\r\nto humbug and bribes, and their votes have no doubt been used to\r\nsustain and perpetuate most flagrant abuses. We often hear it said\r\nthat the only way to get good government is to deprive such people of\r\ntheir votes and limit the suffrage to persons who have some property\r\nat stake. Such a measure has been seriously recommended in New York,\r\nbut it is generally felt to be impossible without a revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Testimony of Pennsylvania Municipal Commission.]\r\nPerhaps, after all, it may not be so desirable as it seems. The\r\nignorant vote has done a great deal of harm, but not all the harm. In\r\n1878 it was reported by the Pennsylvania Municipal Commission, as\r\na remarkable but notorious fact, that the accumulations of debt in\r\nPhiladelphia and other cities of the state have been due, not to a\r\nnon-property-holding, irresponsible element among the electors, but to\r\nthe desire for speculation among the property-owners themselves. Large\r\ntracts of land outside the built-up portion of the city have been\r\npurchased, combinations made among men of wealth, and councils\r\nbesieged until they have been driven into making appropriations to\r\nopen and improve streets and avenues, largely in advance of the real\r\nnecessities of the city. Extraordinary as the statement may seem\r\nat first, the experience of the past shows clearly that frequently\r\nproperty-owners need more protection against themselves than against\r\nthe non-property-holding class.[16] This is a statement of profound\r\nsignificance, and should be duly pondered by advocates of a restricted\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Allinson and Penrose, _Philadelphia, 1681-1887; a\r\nHistory of Municipal Development_, p. 278.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dangers of a restricted suffrage.]\r\nIt should also be borne in mind that, while ignorant and needy voters,\r\nled by unscrupulous demagogues, are capable of doing much harm with\r\ntheir votes, it is by no means clear that the evil would be removed\r\nby depriving them of the suffrage. It is very unsafe to have in any\r\ncommunity a large class of people who feel that political rights\r\nor privileges are withheld from them by other people who are their\r\nsuperiors in wealth or knowledge. Such poor people are apt to have\r\nexaggerated ideas of what a vote can do; very likely they think it is\r\nbecause they do not have votes that they are poor; thus they are ready\r\nto entertain revolutionary or anarchical ideas, and are likely to be\r\nmore dangerous material in the hands of demagogues than if they were\r\nallowed to vote. Universal suffrage has its evils, but it undoubtedly\r\nacts as a safety-valve. The only cure for the evils which come\r\nfrom ignorance and shiftlessness is the abolition of ignorance and\r\nshiftlessness; and this is slow work. Church and school here find\r\nenough to keep them busy; but the vote itself, even if often misused,\r\nis a powerful educator; and we need not regret that the restriction of\r\nthe suffrage has come to be practically impossible.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Baneful effects of mixing city politics with national\r\npolitics.]\r\nThe purification of our city governments will never be completed\r\nuntil they are entirely divorced from national party politics. The\r\nconnection opens a limitless field for \"log-rolling,\" and rivets\r\nupon cities the \"spoils system,\" which is always and everywhere\r\nincompatible with good government. It is worthy of note that the\r\ndegradation of so many English boroughs and cities during the Tudor\r\nand Stuart periods was chiefly due to the encroachment of national\r\npolitics upon municipal politics. Because the borough returned members\r\nto the House of Commons, it became worth while for the crown to\r\nintrigue with the municipal government, with the ultimate object of\r\ninfluencing parliamentary elections. The melancholy history of the\r\nconsequent dickering and dealing, jobbery and robbery, down to 1835,\r\nwhen the great Municipal Corporations Act swept it all away, may be\r\nread with profit by all Americans.[17] It was the city of London only,\r\nwhose power and independence had kept it free from complications with\r\nnational politics, that avoided the abuses elsewhere prevalent, so\r\nthat it was excepted from the provisions of the Act of 1835, and still\r\nretains its ancient constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: See _Parliamentary Reports_, 1835, \"Municipal\r\nCorporations Commission;\" also Sir Erskine May, _Const. Hist._,\r\nvol. ii. chap, xv.]\r\n\r\nIn the United States the entanglement of municipal with national\r\npolitics has begun to be regarded as mischievous and possibly\r\ndangerous, and attempts have in some cases been made toward checking\r\nit by changing the days of election, so that municipal officers may\r\nnot be chosen at the same time with presidential electors. Such a\r\nchange is desirable, but to obtain a thoroughly satisfactory result,\r\nit will be necessary to destroy the \"spoils system\" root and branch,\r\nand to adopt effective measures of ballot reform.

Spain claimed the whole continent on the strength of\r\nthe bulls of 1493 and 1494, in which Pope Alexander VI. granted her\r\nall countries to be discovered to the west of a certain meridian\r\nwhich, happens to pass a little to the east of Newfoundland. From\r\ntheir first centre in the West Indies the Spaniards had made a\r\nlodgment in Florida, at St. Augustine, in 1565; and from Mexico they\r\nhad in 1605 founded Santa Fé, in what is now the territory of New\r\nMexico.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Claims of France and England.]\r\nFrance and England, however, paid little heed to the claim of Spain.\r\nFrance had her own claim to North America, based on the voyages of\r\ndiscovery made by Verrazano in 1524 and Cartier in 1534, in the course\r\nof which New York harbour had been visited and the St. Lawrence partly\r\nexplored. England had a still earlier claim, based on the discovery\r\nof the North American continent in 1497 by John Cabot. It presently\r\nbecame apparent that to make such claims of any value, discovery must\r\nbe followed up by occupation of the country. Attempts at colonization\r\nhad been made by French Protestants in Florida in 1562-65, and by the\r\nEnglish in North Carolina in 1584-87, but both attempts had failed\r\nmiserably. Throughout the sixteenth century French and English sailors\r\nkept visiting the Newfoundland fisheries, and by the end of the\r\ncentury the French and English governments had their attention\r\ndefinitely turned to the founding of colonies in North America.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The London and Plymouth Companies.]\r\nIn 1606 two great joint-stock companies were formed in England for\r\nthe purpose of planting such colonies. One of these companies had its\r\nheadquarters at London, and was called the London Company; the other\r\nhad its headquarters at the seaport of Plymouth, in Devonshire, and\r\nwas called the Plymouth Company. To the London Company the king\r\ngranted the coast of North America from 34° to 38° north latitude;\r\nthat is, about from Cape Fear to the mouth of the Rappahannock. To the\r\nPlymouth Company he granted the coast from 41° to 45°; that is, about\r\nfrom the mouth of the Hudson to the eastern extremity of Maine. These\r\ngrants were to go in straight strips or zones across the continent\r\nfrom the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific. Almost nothing was then known\r\nabout American geography; the distance from ocean to ocean across\r\nMexico was not so very great, and people did not realize that further\r\nnorth it was quite a different thing. As to the middle strip, starting\r\nfrom the coast between the Rappahannock and the Hudson, it was open to\r\nthe two companies, with the understanding that neither was to plant a\r\ncolony within 100 miles of any settlement already begun by the\r\nother. This meant practically that it was likely to be controlled by\r\nwhichever company should first come into the field with a flourishing\r\ncolony. Accordingly both companies made haste and sent out settlers in\r\n1607, the one to the James River, the other to the Kennebec. The\r\nfirst enterprise, after much suffering, resulted in the founding of\r\nVirginia; the second ended in disaster, and it was not until 1620 that\r\nthe Pilgrims from Leyden made the beginnings of a permanent settlement\r\nupon the territory of the Plymouth Company.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Their common charter.]\r\nThese two companies were at first organized under a single charter.\r\nEach was to be governed by a council in England appointed by the king,\r\nand these councils were to appoint councils of thirteen to reside in\r\nthe colonies, with powers practically unlimited. Nevertheless the king\r\ncovenanted with his colonists as follows: Also we do, for us, our\r\nheirs and successors, declare by these presents that all and every the\r\npersons, being our subjects, which shall go and inhabit within the\r\nsaid colony and plantation, and every their children and posterity,\r\nwhich shall happen to be born within any of the limits thereof, shall\r\nhave and enjoy all liberties, franchises, and immunities of free\r\ndenizens and natural subjects within any of our other dominions, to\r\nall intents and purposes as if they had been abiding and born within\r\nthis our realm of England, or in any other of our dominions. This\r\nprinciple, that British subjects born in America should be entitled to\r\nthe same political freedom as if born in England, was one upon which\r\nthe colonists always insisted, and it was the repeated and persistent\r\nattempts of George III. to infringe it that led the American colonies\r\nto revolt and declare themselves independent of Great Britain.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Dissolution of the two companies.]\r\n[Sidenote: Settlement of the three zones.]\r\nBoth the companies founded in 1606 were short-lived. In 1620 the\r\nPlymouth Company got a new charter, which made it independent of the\r\nLondon Company. In 1624 the king, James I., quarreled with the London\r\nCompany, brought suit against it in court, and obtained from the\r\nsubservient judges a decree annulling its charter. In 1635 the\r\nreorganized Plymouth Company surrendered its charter to Charles I.\r\nin pursuance of a bargain which need not here concern us.[1] But the\r\ncreation of these short-lived companies left an abiding impression\r\nupon the map of North America and upon the organization of civil\r\ngovernment in the United States. Let us observe what was done with the\r\nthree strips or zones into which the country was divided: the northern\r\nor New England zone, assigned to the Plymouth Company; the southern or\r\nVirginia zone, assigned to the London Company; and the central zone,\r\nfor which the two companies were, so to speak, to run a race.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See my _Beginnings of New England_, p. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1. the northern zone.]\r\n[Sidenote: 2. The southern zone.]\r\nIn 1663 Charles II. cut off the southern part of Virginia, the area\r\ncovering the present states of North and South Carolina and Georgia,\r\nand it was formed into a new province called Carolina. In 1729 the\r\ntwo groups of settlements which had grown up along its coast were\r\ndefinitively separated into North and South Carolina; and in 1732\r\nthe frontier portion toward Florida was organized into the colony of\r\nGeorgia. Thus four of the original thirteen states--Virginia, the two\r\nCarolinas, and Georgia--were constituted in the southern zone.\r\n\r\nTo this group some writers add Maryland, founded in 1632, because its\r\nterritory had been claimed by the London Company; but the earliest\r\nsettlements in Maryland, its principal towns, and almost the whole of\r\nits territory, come north of latitude 38° and within the middle zone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 3. The middle zone.]\r\nBetween the years 1614 and 1621 the Dutch founded their colony of New\r\nNetherland upon the territory included between the Hudson and Delaware\r\nrivers, or, as they quite naturally called them, the North and South\r\nrivers. They pushed their outposts up the Hudson as far as the site\r\nof Albany, thus intruding far into the northern zone. In 1638 Sweden\r\nplanted a small colony upon the west side of Delaware Bay, but in 1655\r\nit was surrendered to the Dutch. Then in 1664 the English took New\r\nNetherland from the Dutch, and Charles II. granted the province to his\r\nbrother, the Duke of York. The duke proceeded to grant part of it to\r\nhis friends, Berkeley and Carteret, and thus marked off the new colony\r\nof New Jersey. In 1681 the region west of New Jersey was granted to\r\nWilliam Penn, and in the following year Penn bought from the Duke of\r\nYork the small piece of territory upon which the Swedes had planted\r\ntheir colony. Delaware thus became an appendage to Penn's greater\r\ncolony, but was never merged in it. Thus five of the original\r\nthirteen states--Maryland, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\r\nDelaware--were constituted in the middle zone.\r\n\r\nAs we have already observed, the westward movement of population in\r\nthe United States has largely followed the parallels of latitude, and\r\nthus the characteristics of these three original strips or zones have,\r\nwith more or less modification, extended westward. The men of New\r\nEngland, with their Portland and Salem reproduced more than 3000 miles\r\ndistant in the state of Oregon, and within 100 miles of the Pacific\r\nOcean, may be said in a certain sense to have realized literally the\r\nsubstance of King James's grant to the Plymouth Company. It will be\r\nnoticed that the kinds of local government described in our earlier\r\nchapters are characteristic respectively of the three original zones:\r\nthe township system being exemplified chiefly in the northern zone,\r\nthe county system in the southern zone, and the mixed township-county\r\nsystem in the central zone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: House of Burgesses in Virginia.]\r\nThe London and Plymouth companies did not perish until after state\r\ngovernments had been organized in the colonies already founded upon\r\ntheir territories. In 1619 the colonists of Virginia, with the aid of\r\nthe more liberal spirits in the London Company, secured for themselves\r\na representative government; to the governor and his council,\r\nappointed in England, there was added a general assembly composed of\r\ntwo burgesses from each \"plantation,\" [2] elected by the inhabitants.\r\nThis assembly, the first legislative body that ever sat in America,\r\nmet on the 30th of July, 1619, in the choir of the rude church at\r\nJamestown. The dignity of the burgesses was preserved, as in the House\r\nof Commons, by sitting with their hats on; and after offering prayer,\r\nand taking the oath of allegiance and supremacy, they proceeded to\r\nenact a number of laws relating to public worship, to agriculture, and\r\nto intercourse with the Indians. Curiously enough, so confident was\r\nthe belief of the settlers that they were founding towns, that they\r\ncalled their representatives \"burgesses,\" and down to 1776 the\r\nassembly continued to be known as the House of \"Burgesses,\" although\r\ntowns refused to grow in Virginia, and soon after counties were\r\norganized in 1634 the burgesses sat for counties. Such were the\r\nbeginnings of representative government in Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The word \"plantation\" is here used, not in its later and\r\nordinary sense, as the estate belonging to an individual planter,\r\nbut in an earlier sense. In this early usage it was equivalent to\r\n\"settlement.\" It was used in New England as well as in Virginia;\r\nthus Salem was spoken of by the court of assistants in 1629 as \"New\r\nEngland's Plantation.\"]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Company of Massachusetts Bay.]\r\nThe government of Massachusetts is descended from the Dorchester\r\nCompany formed in England in 1623, for the ostensible purpose of\r\ntrading in furs and timber and catching fish on the shores of\r\nMassachusetts Bay. After a disastrous beginning this company was\r\ndissolved, but only to be immediately reorganized on a greater scale.\r\nIn 1628 a grant of the land between the Charles and Merrimack rivers\r\nwas obtained from the Plymouth Company; and in 1629 a charter was\r\nobtained from Charles I. So many men from the east of England had\r\njoined in the enterprise that it could no longer be fitly called a\r\nDorchester Company. The new name was significantly taken from the\r\nNew World. The charter created a corporation under the style of the\r\nGovernor and Company of Massachusetts Bay in New England. The freemen\r\nof the Company were to hold a meeting four times a year; and they were\r\nempowered to choose a governor, a deputy governor, and a council of\r\neighteen assistants, who were to hold their meetings each month. They\r\ncould administer oaths of supremacy and allegiance, raise troops\r\nfor the defence of their possessions, admit new associates into the\r\nCompany, and make regulations for the management of their business,\r\nwith the vague and weak proviso that in order to be valid their\r\nenactment must in no wise contravene the laws of England. Nothing was\r\nsaid as to the place where the Company should hold its meetings, and\r\naccordingly after a few months the Company transferred itself and\r\nits charter to New England, in order that it might carry out its\r\nintentions with as little interference as possible on the part of the\r\ncrown.\r\n\r\nWhether this transfer of the charter was legally justifiable or not\r\nis a question which has been much debated, but with which we need not\r\nhere vex ourselves. The lawyers of the Company were shrewd enough to\r\nknow that a loosely-drawn instrument may be made to admit of great\r\nliberty of action. Under the guise of a mere trading corporation the\r\nPuritan leaders deliberately intended to found a civil commonwealth in\r\naccordance with their own theories of government.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Government of Massachusetts; the General Court]\r\nAfter their arrival in Massachusetts, their numbers increased so\r\nrapidly that it became impossible to have a primary assembly of all\r\nthe freemen, and so a representative assembly was devised after the\r\nmodel of the Old English county court. The representatives sat for\r\ntownships, and were called deputies. At first they sat in the same\r\nchamber with the assistants, but in 1644 the legislative body was\r\ndivided into two chambers, the deputies forming the lower house, while\r\nthe upper was composed of the assistants, who were sometimes called\r\nmagistrates. In elections the candidates for the upper house were put\r\nin nomination by the General Court and voted on by the freemen. In\r\ngeneral the assistants represented the common or central power of\r\nthe colony, while the deputies represented the interests of popular\r\nself-government. The former was comparatively an aristocratic and the\r\nlatter a democratic body, and there were frequent disputes between the\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that the governing body thus constituted was at\r\nonce a legislative and a judicial body, like the English county court\r\nwhich served as its model. Inferior courts were organized at an early\r\ndate in Massachusetts, but the highest judicial tribunal was the\r\nlegislature, which was known as the General Court. It still bears this\r\nname to-day, though it long ago ceased to exercise judicial functions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: New charter of Massachusetts]\r\nNow as the freemen of Massachusetts directly chose their governor and\r\ndeputy-governor, as well as their chamber of deputies, and also took\r\npart in choosing their council of assistants, their government was\r\nvirtually that of an independent republic. The crown could interpose\r\nno effective check upon its proceedings except by threatening to annul\r\nits charter and send over a viceroy who might be backed up, if need\r\nbe, by military force. Such threats were sometimes openly made, but\r\noftener hinted at. They served to make the Massachusetts government\r\nsomewhat wary and circumspect, but they did not prevent it from\r\npursuing a very independent policy in many respects, as when,\r\nfor example, it persisted in allowing none but members of the\r\nCongregational church to vote. This measure, by which it was intended\r\nto preserve the Puritan policy unchanged, was extremely distasteful to\r\nthe British government. At length in 1684 the Massachusetts charter\r\nwas annulled, an attempt was made to suppress town-meetings, and the\r\ncolony was placed under a military viceroy, Sir Edmund Andros. After\r\na brief period of despotic rule, the Revolution in England worked a\r\nchange. In 1692 Massachusetts received a new charter, quite different\r\nfrom the old one. The people were allowed to elect representatives to\r\nthe General Court, as before, but the governor and lieutenant-governor\r\nwere appointed by the crown, and all acts of the legislature were\r\nto be sent to England for royal approval. The general government of\r\nMassachusetts was thus, except for its possession of a charter, made\r\nsimilar to that of Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Connecticut and Rhode Island]\r\nThe governments of Connecticut and Rhode Island were constructed\r\nupon the same general plan as the first government of Massachusetts.\r\nGovernors councils, and assemblies were elected by the people. These\r\ngovernments were made by the settlers themselves, after they had come\r\nout from Massachusetts; and through a very singular combination of\r\ncircumstances[3] they were confirmed by charters granted by Charles II\r\nin 1662, soon after his return from exile. So thoroughly republican\r\nwere these governments that they remained without change until 1818 in\r\nConnecticut and until 1842 in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See my _Beginnings of New England_, pp. 192-196.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe thus observe two kinds of state government in the American\r\ncolonies. In both kinds the people choose a representative legislative\r\nassembly; but in the one kind they also choose their governor, while\r\nin the other kind the governor is appointed by the crown. We have now\r\nto observe a third kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Counties palatine in England]\r\n[Sidenote: Charter of Maryland]\r\nAfter the downfall of the two great companies founded in 1606, the\r\ncrown had a way of handing over to its friends extensive tracts of\r\nland in America. In 1632 a charter granted by Charles I to Cecilius\r\nCalvert, Lord Baltimore, founded the palatinate colony of Maryland. To\r\nunderstand the nature of this charter, we must observe that among the\r\ncounties of England there were three whose rulers from an early time\r\nwere allowed special privileges. Because Cheshire and Durham bordered\r\nupon the hostile countries, Wales and Scotland, and needed to be ever\r\non the alert, their rulers, the earls of Chester and the bishops of\r\nDurham, were clothed with almost royal powers of command, and similar\r\npowers were afterwards granted through favouritism to the dukes of\r\nLancaster. The three counties were called counties palatine (i.e.\r\n\"palace counties\"). Before 1600 the earldom of Chester and the duchy\r\nof Lancaster had been absorbed by the crown, but the bishopric of\r\nDurham remained the type of an almost independent state, and the\r\ncolony palatine of Maryland was modelled after it. The charter of\r\nMaryland conferred upon Lord Baltimore the most extensive privileges\r\never bestowed by the British crown upon any subject. He was made\r\nabsolute lord of the land and water within his boundaries, could erect\r\ntowns, cities, and ports, make war or peace, call the whole fighting\r\npopulation to arms and declare martial law, levy tolls and duties,\r\nestablish courts of justice, appoint judges, magistrates, and other\r\ncivil officers, execute the laws, and pardon offenders. He could erect\r\nmanors, with courts-baron and courts-leet, and confer titles and\r\ndignities, so that they differed from those of England. He could make\r\nlaws with the assent of the freemen of the province, and, in cases of\r\nemergency, ordinances not impairing life, limb, or property, without\r\ntheir assent. He could found churches and chapels, have them\r\nconsecrated according to the ecclesiastical laws of England, and\r\nappoint the incumbents.[4] For his territory and these royal powers\r\nLord Baltimore was to send over to the palace at Windsor a tribute of\r\ntwo Indian arrows yearly, and to reserve for the king one fifth part\r\nof such gold and silver as he might happen to get by mining. \"The king\r\nfurthermore bound himself and his successors to lay no taxes, customs,\r\nsubsidies, or contributions whatever upon the people of the province,\r\nand in case of any such demand being made, the charter expressly\r\ndeclared that this clause might be pleaded as a discharge in full.\"\r\nMaryland was thus almost an independent state. Baltimore's title was\r\nLord Proprietary of Maryland, and his title and powers were made\r\nhereditary in his family, so that he was virtually a feudal king. His\r\nrule, however, was effectually limited. The government of Maryland was\r\ncarried on by a governor and a two-chambered legislature. The governor\r\nand the members of the upper house of the legislature were appointed\r\nby the lord proprietary, but the lower house of the legislature was\r\nelected, here as elsewhere, by the people; and in accordance with\r\ntime-honoured English custom all taxation must originate in the lower\r\nhouse, which represented the people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Browne's _Maryland: the History of a Palatinate_, p.\r\n19.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Charter of Pennsylvania.]\r\n[Sidenote: Mason and Dixon's line]\r\nHalf a century after the founding of Maryland, similar though somewhat\r\nless extensive proprietary powers were granted by Charles II. to\r\nWilliam Penn, and under them the colony of Pennsylvania was founded\r\nand Delaware was purchased. Pennsylvania and Delaware had each its\r\nhouse of representatives elected by the people; but there was only one\r\ngovernor and council for the two colonies. The governor and council\r\nwere appointed by the lord proprietary, and as the council confined\r\nitself to advising the governor and did not take part in legislation,\r\nthere was no upper house. The legislature was one-chambered. The\r\noffice of lord proprietary was hereditary in the Penn family. For\r\nabout eighty years the Penns and Calverts quarrelled, like true\r\nsovereigns, about the boundary-line between their principalities,\r\nuntil in 1763 the matter was finally settled. A line was agreed upon,\r\nand the survey was made by two distinguished mathematicians, Charles\r\nMason and Jeremiah Dixon. The line ran westward 244 miles from the\r\nDelaware River, and every fifth milestone was engraved with the arms\r\nof Penn on the one side and those of Calvert on the other. In later\r\ntimes, after all the states north of Maryland had abolished slavery,\r\nMason and Dixon's line became famous as the boundary between slave\r\nstates and free states.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other proprietary governments.]\r\nAt first there were other proprietary colonies besides those just\r\nmentioned, but in course of time the rights or powers of their lords\r\nproprietary were resumed by the crown. When New Netherland was\r\nconquered from the Dutch it was granted to the duke of York as lord\r\nproprietary; but after one-and-twenty years the duke ascended the\r\nthrone as James II., and so the part of the colony which he had kept\r\nbecame the royal province of New York. The part which he had sold to\r\nBerkeley and Carteret remained for a while the proprietary colony of\r\nNew Jersey, sometimes under one government, sometimes divided between\r\ntwo; but the rule of the lords proprietary was very unpopular, and in\r\n1702 their rights were surrendered to the crown. The Carolinas and\r\nGeorgia were also at first proprietary colonies, but after a while\r\nthey willingly came under the direct sway of the crown. In general the\r\nproprietary governments were unpopular because the lords proprietary,\r\nwho usually lived in England and visited their colonies but seldom,\r\nwere apt to regard their colonies simply as sources of personal\r\nincome. This was not the case with William Penn, or the earlier\r\nCalverts, or with James Oglethorpe, the illustrious founder of\r\nGeorgia; but it was too often the case. So long as the lord's rents,\r\nfees, and other emoluments were duly collected, he troubled himself\r\nvery little as to what went on in the colony. If that had been all,\r\nthe colony would have troubled itself very little about him. But the\r\ngovernor appointed by this absentee master was liable to be more\r\ndevoted to his interests than to those of the people, and the civil\r\nservice was seriously damaged by worthless favourites sent over from\r\nEngland for whom the governor was expected to find some office that\r\nwould pay them a salary. On the whole, it seemed less unsatisfactory\r\nto have the governors appointed by the crown; and so before the\r\nRevolutionary War all the proprietary governments had fallen, except\r\nthose of the Penns and the Calverts, which doubtless survived because\r\nthey were the best organized and best administered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: At the time of the Revolution there were three forms of\r\ncolonial government: 1. Republican, 2. Proprietary, 3. Royal.]\r\nThere were thus at the time of the Revolutionary War three forms of\r\nstate government in the American colonies. There were, _first_,\r\nthe Republican colonies, in which the governors were elected by the\r\npeople, as in Rhode Island and Connecticut; _secondly,_the\r\nProprietary colonies, in which the governors were appointed by\r\nhereditary proprietors, as in Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Delaware;\r\n_thirdly_, the Royal colonies,[5] in which the governors were\r\nappointed by the crown, as in Georgia, the two Carolinas, Virginia,\r\nNew Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. It is\r\ncustomary to distinguish the Republican colonies as _Charter_\r\ncolonies, but that is not an accurate distinction, inasmuch as the\r\nProprietary colonies also had charters. And among the Royal colonies,\r\nMassachusetts, having been originally a republic, still had a charter\r\nin which her rights were so defined as to place her in a somewhat\r\ndifferent position from the other Royal colonies; so that Prof.\r\nAlexander Johnston, with some reason, puts her in a class by herself\r\nas a _Semi-royal_ colony.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Or, as they were sometimes called, Royal\r\n_provinces._ In the history of Massachusetts many writers\r\ndistinguish the period before 1692 as the _colonial_ period, and\r\nthe period 1692 to 1774 as the _provincial_ period.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In all three forms there was a representative assembly, which\r\nalone could impose taxes.]\r\nThese differences, it will be observed, related to the character and\r\nmethod of filling the governor's office. In the Republican colonies\r\nthe governor naturally represented the interests of the people, in the\r\nProprietary colonies he was the agent of the Penns or the Calverts,\r\nin the Royal colonies he was the agent of the king. All the thirteen\r\ncolonies alike had a legislative assembly elected by the people. The\r\nbasis of representation might be different in different colonies,\r\nas we have seen that in Massachusetts the delegates represented\r\ntownships, whereas in Virginia they represented counties; but in all\r\nalike the assembly was a truly representative body, and in all alike\r\nit was the body that controlled the expenditure of public money. These\r\nrepresentative assemblies arose spontaneously because the founders of\r\nthe American colonies were Englishmen used from time immemorial to tax\r\nthemselves and govern themselves. As they had been wont to vote for\r\nrepresentatives in England, instead of leaving things to be controlled\r\nby the king, so now they voted for representatives in Maryland or New\r\nYork, instead of leaving things to be controlled by the governor. The\r\nspontaneousness of all this is quaintly and forcibly expressed by the\r\ngreat Tory historian Hutchinson, who tells us that in the year 1619 a\r\nhouse of burgesses _broke out_ in Virginia! as if it had been the\r\nmumps, or original sin, or any of those things that people cannot help\r\nhaving.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The governor's council was a kind of upper house.]\r\nThis representative assembly was the lower house in the colonial\r\nlegislatures. The governor always had a council to advise with him and\r\nassist him in his executive duties, in imitation of the king's privy\r\ncouncil in England. But in nearly all the colonies this council took\r\npart in the work of legislation, and thus sat as an upper house, with\r\nmore or less power of reviewing and amending the acts of the assembly.\r\nIn Pennsylvania, as already observed, the council refrained from this\r\nlegislative work, and so, until some years after the Revolution, the\r\nPennsylvania legislature was one-chambered. The members of the council\r\nwere appointed in different ways, sometimes by the king or the lord\r\nproprietary, or, as in Massachusetts, by the outgoing legislature, or,\r\nas in Connecticut, they were elected by the people.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The colonial government was like the English system in\r\nminiature.]\r\nThus all the colonies had a government framed after the model to which\r\nthe people had been accustomed in England. It was like the English\r\nsystem in miniature, the governor answering to the king, and the\r\nlegislature, usually two-chambered, answering to parliament. And as\r\nquarrels between king and parliament were not uncommon, so quarrels\r\nbetween governor and legislature were very frequent indeed, except\r\nin Connecticut and Rhode Island. The royal governors, representing\r\nBritish imperial ideas rather than American ideas, were sure to come\r\ninto conflict with the popular assemblies, and sometimes became\r\nthe objects of bitter popular hatred. The disputes were apt to be\r\nconcerned with questions in which taxation was involved, such as\r\nthe salaries of crown officers, the appropriations for war with\r\nthe Indians, and so on. Such disputes bred more or less popular\r\ndiscontent, but the struggle did not become flagrant so long as the\r\nBritish parliament refrained from meddling with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Americans never admitted the supremacy of parliament;]\r\nThe Americans never regarded parliament as possessing any rightful\r\nauthority over their internal affairs. When the earliest colonies were\r\nfounded, it was the general theory that the American wilderness was\r\npart of the king's private domain and not subject to the control of\r\nparliament. This theory lived on in America, but died out in England.\r\nOn the one hand the Americans had their own legislatures, which stood\r\nto them in the place of parliament. The authority of parliament was\r\nderived from the fact that it was a representative body, but it did\r\nnot represent Americans. Accordingly the Americans held that the\r\nrelation of each American colony to Great Britain was like the\r\nrelation between England and Scotland in the seventeenth century.\r\nEngland and Scotland then had the same king, but separate parliaments,\r\nand the English parliament could not make laws for Scotland. Such is\r\nthe connection between Sweden and Norway at the present day; they have\r\nthe same king, but each country legislates for itself. So the American\r\ncolonists held that Virginia, for example, and Great Britain had the\r\nsame king, but each its independent legislature; and so with the\r\nother colonies,--there were thirteen parliaments in America, each as\r\nsovereign within its own sphere as the parliament at Westminster, and\r\nthe latter had no more right to tax the people of Massachusetts than\r\nthe Massachusetts legislature had to tax the people of Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn one respect, however, the Americans did admit that parliament had a\r\ngeneral right of supervision over all parts of the British empire.[6]\r\nMaritime commerce seemed to be as much the affair of one part of the\r\nempire as another, and it seemed right that it should be regulated by\r\nthe central parliament at Westminster. Accordingly the Americans did\r\nnot resist custom-house taxes as long as they seemed to be imposed\r\nfor purely commercial purposes; but they were quick to resist direct\r\ntaxation, and custom-house taxes likewise, as soon as these began to\r\nform a part of schemes for extending the authority of parliament over\r\nthe colonies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: except in the regulation of maritime commerce.]\r\n\r\nIn England, on the other hand, this theory that the Americans were\r\nsubject to the king's authority but not to that of parliament\r\nnaturally became unintelligible after the king himself had become\r\nvirtually subject to parliament.[7] The Stuart kings might call\r\nthemselves kings by the grace of God, but since 1688 the sovereigns of\r\nGreat Britain owe their seat upon the throne to an act of parliament.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: In England there grew up the theory of the imperial\r\nsupremacy of parliament.]\r\n\r\nTo suppose that the king's American subjects were not amenable to the\r\nauthority of parliament seemed like supposing that a stream could rise\r\nhigher than its source. Besides, after 1700 the British empire began\r\nto expand in all parts of the world, and the business of parliament\r\nbecame more and more imperial. It could make laws for the East India\r\nCompany; why not, then, for the Company of Massachusetts Bay?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conflict between the British and the American theories was\r\nprecipitated by George III.]\r\nThus the American theory of the situation was irreconcilable with\r\nthe British theory, and when parliament in 1765, with no unfriendly\r\npurpose, began laying taxes upon the Americans, thus invading the\r\nprovince of the colonial legislatures, the Americans refused to\r\nsubmit. The ensuing quarrel might doubtless have been peacefully\r\nadjusted, had not the king, George III., happened to be entertaining\r\npolitical schemes which were threatened with ruin if the Americans\r\nshould get a fair hearing for their side of the case.[8] Thus\r\npolitical intrigue came in to make the situation hopeless. When a\r\nstate of things arises, with which men's established methods of civil\r\ngovernment are incompetent to deal, men fall back upon the primitive\r\nmethod which was in vogue before civil government began to exist.\r\nThey fight it out; and so we had our Revolutionary War, and became\r\nseparated politically from Great Britain. It is worthy of note, in\r\nthis connection, that the last act of parliament, which brought\r\nmatters to a crisis, was the so-called Regulating Act of April, 1774,\r\nthe purpose of which was to change the government of Massachusetts.\r\nThis act provided that members of the council should be appointed by\r\nthe royal governor, that they should be paid by the crown and thus\r\nbe kept subservient to it, that the principal executive and judicial\r\nofficers should be likewise paid by the crown, and that town-meetings\r\nshould be prohibited except for the sole purpose of electing town\r\nofficers. Other unwarrantable acts were passed at the same time, but\r\nthis was the worst. Troops were sent over to aid in enforcing this\r\nact, the people of Massachusetts refused to recognize its validity,\r\nand out of this political situation came the battles of Lexington and\r\nBunker Hill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: See my _War of Independence_, pp. 58-64, 69-71\r\n(Riverside Library for Young People).]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

The case of Massachusetts\r\nmay serve as an illustration. There, as in the other colonies, the\r\ngovernor had the power of dissolving the assembly. This was like the\r\nking's power of dissolving parliament in the days of the Stuarts.\r\nIt was then a dangerous power. In modern England there is nothing\r\ndangerous in a dissolution of parliament; on the contrary, it is a\r\nuseful device for ascertaining the wishes of the people, for a new\r\nHouse of Commons must be elected immediately. But in old times the\r\nking would turn his parliament out of doors, and as long as he could\r\nbeg, borrow, or steal enough money to carry on government according to\r\nhis own notions, he would not order a new election. Fortunately such\r\nperiods were not very long. The latest instance was in the reign of\r\nCharles I, who got on without a parliament from 1629 to 1640.[9] In\r\nthe American colonies the dissolution of the assembly by the governor\r\nwas not especially dangerous, but it sometimes made mischief by\r\ndelaying needed legislation. During the few years preceding the\r\nRevolution, the assemblies were so often dissolved that it became\r\nnecessary for the people to devise some new way of getting their\r\nrepresentatives together to act for the colony. In Massachusetts this\r\nend was attained by the famous \"Committees of Correspondence.\" No one\r\ncould deny that town-meetings were legal, or that the people of\r\none township had a right to ask advice from the people of another\r\ntownship. Accordingly each township appointed a committee to\r\ncorrespond or confer with committees from other townships. This system\r\nwas put into operation by Samuel Adams in 1772, and for the next two\r\nyears the popular resistance to the crown was organized by these\r\ncommittees. For example, before the tea was thrown into Boston\r\nharbour, the Boston committee sought and received advice from every\r\ntownship in Massachusetts, and the treatment of the tea-ships was from\r\nfirst to last directed by the committees of Boston and five neighbour\r\ntowns.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 9: The kings of France contrived to get along without a\r\nrepresentative assembly from 1614 to 1789, and during this long period\r\nabuses so multiplied that the meeting of the States-General in 1789\r\nprecipitated the great revolution which overthrew the monarchy.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Provincial Congress]\r\nIn 1774 a further step was taken. As parliament had overthrown the old\r\ngovernment, and sent over General Gage as military governor, to put\r\nits new system into operation, the people defied and ignored Gage, and\r\nthe townships elected delegates to meet together in what was called a\r\n\"Provincial Congress.\" The president of this congress was the chief\r\nprovincial executive officer of the commonwealth, and there was a\r\nsmall executive council, known as the \"Committee of Safety.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Provisional governments; \"governors\" and \"presidents.\"]\r\nThis provisional government lasted about a year. In the summer of\r\n1775 the people went further. They fell back upon their charter and\r\nproceeded to carry on their government as it had been carried on\r\nbefore 1774, except that the governor was left out altogether. The\r\npeople in town-meeting elected their representatives to a general\r\nassembly, as of old, and this assembly chose a council of twenty-eight\r\nmembers to sit as an upper house. The president of the council was the\r\nforemost executive officer of the commonwealth, but he had not the\r\npowers of a governor. He was no more the governor than the president\r\nof our federal senate is the president of the United States. The\r\npowers of the governor were really vested in the council, which was\r\nan executive as well as a legislative body, and the president was\r\nits chairman. Indeed, the title \"president\" is simply the Latin for\r\n\"chairman,\" he who \"presides\" or \"sits before\" an assembly. In 1775\r\nit was a more modest title than \"governor,\" and had not the smack of\r\nsemi-royalty which lingered about the latter. Governors had made so\r\nmuch trouble that people were distrustful of the office, and at first\r\nit was thought that the council would be quite sufficient for the\r\nexecutive work that was to be done. Several of the states thus\r\norganized their governments with a council at the head instead of\r\na governor; and hence in reading about that period one often comes\r\nacross the title \"president,\" somewhat loosely used as if equivalent\r\nto governor. Thus in 1787 we find Benjamin Franklin called \"president\r\nof Pennsylvania,\" meaning \"president of the council of Pennsylvania.\"\r\nBut this arrangement did not prove satisfactory and did not last long.\r\nIt soon appeared that for executive work one man is better than a\r\ngroup of men. In Massachusetts, in 1780, the old charter was replaced\r\nby a new written constitution, under which was formed the state\r\ngovernment which, with some emendations in detail, has continued to\r\nthe present day. Before the end of the eighteenth century all the\r\nstates except Connecticut and Rhode Island, which, had always been\r\npractically Independent, thus remodelled their governments.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of the Senates.]\r\nThese changes, however, were very conservative. The old form of\r\ngovernment was closely followed. First there was the governor, elected\r\nin some states by the legislature, in others by the people. Then there\r\nwas the two-chambered legislature, of which the lower house was the\r\nsame institution after the Revolution that it had been before. The\r\nupper house, or council, was retained, but in a somewhat altered\r\nform. The Americans had been used to having the acts of their popular\r\nassemblies reviewed by a council, and so they retained this revisory\r\nbody as an upper house. But the fashion of copying names and titles\r\nfrom the ancient Roman republic was then prevalent, and accordingly\r\nthe upper house was called a Senate. There was a higher property\r\nqualification for senators than for representatives, and generally\r\ntheir terms of service were longer. In some states they were chosen by\r\nthe people, in others by the lower house. In Maryland they were chosen\r\nby a special college of electors, an arrangement which was copied in\r\nour federal government in the election of the president of the United\r\nStates. In most of the states there was a lieutenant-governor, as\r\nthere had been in the colonial period, to serve in case of the\r\ngovernor's death or incapacity; ordinarily the lieutenant-governor\r\npresided over the senate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Likenesses and differences between British and American\r\nsystems.]\r\nThus our state governments came to be repetitions on a small scale of\r\nthe king, lords, and commons of England. The governor answered to the\r\nking, with his dignity very much curtailed by election for a short\r\nperiod. The senate answered to the House of Lords except in being a\r\nrepresentative and not a hereditary body. It was supposed to represent\r\nmore especially that part of the community which was possessed of most\r\nwealth and consideration; and in several states the senators were\r\napportioned with some reference to the amount of taxes paid by\r\ndifferent parts of the state.[10] When New York made its senate a\r\nsupreme court of appeal, it was in deliberate imitation of the House\r\nof Lords. On the other hand, the House of Representatives answered to\r\nthe House of Commons as it used to be in the days when its power was\r\nreally limited by that of the upper house and the king. At the present\r\nday the English of Commons is a supreme body. In case of a serious\r\ndifference with the House of Lords, the upper house must yield, or\r\nelse new peers will be created in sufficient number to reverse its\r\nvote; and the lords always yield before this point is reached. So,\r\ntoo, though the veto power of the sovereign has never been explicitly\r\nabolished, it has not been exercised since 1707, and would not now be\r\ntolerated for a moment. In America there is no such supreme body. The\r\nbill passed by the lower house may be thrown out by the upper house,\r\nor if it passes both it may be vetoed by the governor; and unless the\r\nbill can again pass both houses by more than a simple majority, the\r\nveto will stand. In most of the states a two-thirds vote in the\r\naffirmative is required.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: See my _Critical Period of American History_, p.\r\n68.]\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

Some differences between the British system and the American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3. _The State Governments._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Later modifications.]\r\nDuring the present century our state governments have undergone\r\nmore or less revision, chiefly in the way of abolishing property\r\nqualifications for offices making the suffrage universal, and electing\r\nofficers that were formerly appointed. Only in Delaware does there\r\nstill remain a property qualification for senators. There is no longer\r\nany distinction in principle between the upper and lower houses of the\r\nlegislature. Both represent population, the usual difference being\r\nthat the senate consists of fewer members who represent larger\r\ndistricts. Usually, too, the term of the representatives is two years,\r\nand the whole house is elected at the same time, while the term of\r\nsenators is four years, and half the number are elected every two\r\nyears. This system of two-chambered legislatures is probably retained\r\nchiefly through a spirit of conservatism, because it is what we\r\nare used to. But it no doubt has real advantages in checking hasty\r\nlegislation. People are always wanting to have laws made about all\r\nsorts of things, and in nine cases out of ten their laws would be\r\npernicious laws; so that it is well not to have legislation made too\r\neasy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The suffrage.]\r\nThe suffrage by which the legislature is elected is almost universal.\r\nIt is given in all the states to all male citizens who have reached\r\nthe age of one-and-twenty. In many it is given also to _denizens_\r\nof foreign birth who have declared an intention of becoming citizens.\r\nIn some it is given without further specification to every male\r\n_inhabitant_ of voting age. Residence in the state for some\r\nperiod, varying from three months to two years and a half, is also\r\ngenerally required; sometimes a certain length of residence in the\r\ncounty, the town, or even in the voting precinct, is prescribed. In\r\nmany of the states it is necessary to have paid one's poll-tax. There\r\nis no longer any property qualification, though there was until\r\nrecently in Rhode Island, Criminals, idiots, and lunatics are excluded\r\nfrom the suffrage. Some states also exclude duellists and men who bet\r\non elections. Connecticut and Massachusetts shut out persons who are\r\nunable to read. In no other country has access to citizenship and the\r\nsuffrage been made so easy.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Separation between legislation and the executive.]\r\nA peculiar feature of American governments, and something which it is\r\nhard for Europeans to understand, is the almost complete separation\r\nbetween the executive and the legislative departments. In European\r\ncountries the great executive officers are either members of the\r\nlegislature, or at all events have the right to be present at its\r\nmeetings and take part in its discussions; and as they generally have\r\nsome definite policy by which they are to stand or fall, they are wont\r\nto initiate legislation and to guide the course of the discussion. But\r\nin America the legislatures, having no such central points about which\r\nto rally their forces, carry on their work in an aimless, rambling\r\nsort of way, through the agency of many standing committees. When\r\na measure is proposed it is referred to one of the committees for\r\nexamination before the house will have anything to do with it. Such a\r\npreliminary examination is of course necessary where there is a vast\r\namount of legislative work going on. But the private and disconnected\r\nway in which our committee work is done tends to prevent full and\r\ninstructive discussion in the house, to make the mass of legislation,\r\nalways chaotic enough, somewhat more chaotic, and to facilitate the\r\nvarious evil devices of lobbying and log-rolling.\r\n\r\nIn pointing out this inconvenience attendant upon the American plan of\r\nseparating the executive and legislative departments, I must not be\r\nunderstood as advocating the European plan as preferable for this\r\ncountry. The evils that inevitably flow from any fundamental change in\r\nthe institutions of a country are apt to be much more serious than the\r\nevils which the change is intended to remove. Political government is\r\nlike a plant; a little watering and pruning do very well for it, but\r\nthe less its roots are fooled with, the better. In the American system\r\nof government the independence of the executive department, with\r\nreference to the legislative, is fundamental; and on the whole it is\r\neminently desirable. One of the most serious of the dangers which\r\nbeset democratic government, especially where it is conducted on a\r\ngreat scale, is the danger that the majority for the time being will\r\nuse its power tyrannically and unscrupulously, as it is always tempted\r\nto do. Against such unbridled democracy we have striven to guard\r\nourselves by various constitutional checks and balances. Our written\r\nconstitutions and our Supreme Court are important safeguards, as\r\nwill be shown below. The independence of our executives is another\r\nimportant safeguard. But if our executive departments were mere\r\ncommittees of the legislature--like the English cabinet, for\r\nexample--this independence could not possibly be maintained; and the\r\nloss of it would doubtless entail upon us evils far greater than those\r\nwhich mow flow from want of leadership in our legislatures.[11]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: In two admirable essays on \"Cabinet Responsibility and\r\nthe Constitution,\" and \"Democracy and the Constitution,\" Mr. Lawrence\r\nLowell has convincingly argued that the American system is best\r\nadapted to the circumstances of this country. Lowell, _Essays on\r\nGovernment_, pp. 20-117, Boston, 1890.]\r\n\r\nWe must remember that government is necessarily a cumbrous affair,\r\nhowever conducted.\r\n\r\nThe only occasion on which the governor is a part of the legislature\r\nis when he signs or vetoes a bill. Then he is virtually in himself\r\na third house.[12] As an executive officer the governor is far less\r\npowerful than in the colonial times. We shall see the reason of\r\nthis after we have enumerated some of the principal offices in the\r\nexecutive department. There is always a secretary of state, whose main\r\nduty is to make and keep the records of state transactions. There is\r\nalways a state treasurer, and usually a state auditor or comptroller\r\nto examine the public accounts and issue the warrants without which\r\nthe treasurer cannot pay out a penny of the state's money. There is\r\nalmost always an attorney-general, to appear for the state in the\r\nsupreme court in all cases in which the state is a party, and in\r\nall prosecutions for capital offences. He also exercises some\r\nsuperintendence over the district attorneys, and acts as legal adviser\r\nto the governors and the legislature. There is also in many states\r\na superintendent of education; and in some there are boards of\r\neducation, of health, of lunacy and charity, bureau of agriculture,\r\ncommissioners of prisons, of railroads, of mines, of harbours, of\r\nimmigration, and so on. Sometimes such boards are appointed by the\r\ngovernor, but such officers as the secretary of state, the treasurer,\r\nauditor, and attorney-general are, in almost all the states, elected\r\nby the people. They are not responsible to the governor, but to the\r\npeople who elect them. They are not subordinate to the governor, but\r\nare rather his colleagues. Strictly speaking, the governor is not the\r\nhead of the executive department, but a member of it. The executive\r\ndepartment is parcelled out in several pieces, and his is one of the\r\npieces.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: The state executive.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The governor's functions: 1. Advisor of legislature. 2.\r\nCommander of state militia. 3. Royal prerogative of pardon. 4. Veto power.]\r\nThe ordinary functions of the governor are four in number. 1. He\r\nsends a message to the legislature, at the beginning of each session,\r\nrecommending such measures as he would like to see embodied in\r\nlegislation. 2. He is commander-in-chief of the state militia, and as\r\nsuch can assist the sheriff of a county in putting down a riot, or\r\nthe President of the United States, in the event of a war. On such\r\noccasions the governor may become a personage of immense importance,\r\nas, for example, in our Civil War, when President Lincoln's demands\r\nfor troops met with such prompt response from the men who will be\r\nknown to history as the great \"war governors.\" 3. The governor is\r\ninvested with the royal prerogative of pardoning criminals, or\r\ncommuting the sentences pronounced upon them by the courts. This power\r\nbelongs to kings in accordance with the old feudal notion that the\r\nking was the source or fountain of justice. When properly used it\r\naffords an opportunity for rectifying some injustice for which the\r\nordinary machinery of the law could not provide, or for making such\r\nallowances for extraordinary circumstances as the court could not\r\nproperly consider. In our country it is too often improperly used to\r\nenable the worst criminals to escape due punishment, just because\r\nit is a disagreeable duty to hang them. Such misplaced clemency is\r\npleasant for the murderers, but it makes life less secure for honest\r\nmen and women, and in the less civilized regions of our country it\r\nencourages lynch law. 4. In all the states except Rhode Island,\r\nDelaware, Ohio, and North Carolina, the governor has a veto upon the\r\nacts of the legislature, as above explained; and in ordinary times\r\nthis power, which is not executive but legislative, is probably the\r\ngovernor's most important and considerable power. In thirteen of\r\nthe states the governor can veto particular items in a bill for the\r\nappropriation of public money, while at the same time he approves\r\nthe rest of the bill. This is a most important safeguard against\r\ncorruption, because where the governor does not have this power it is\r\npossible to make appropriations for unworthy or scandalous purposes\r\nalong with appropriations for matters of absolute necessity, and then\r\nto lump them all together in the same bill, so that the governor must\r\neither accept the bad along with the good or reject the good along\r\nwith the bad. It is a great gain when the governor can select the\r\nitems and veto some while approving others. In such matters the\r\ngovernor is often more honest and discreet than the legislature, if\r\nfor no other reason, because he is one man, and responsibility can be\r\nfixed upon him more clearly than upon two or three hundred.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief outline, is the framework of the American state\r\ngovernments. But our account would be very incomplete without some\r\nmention of three points, all of them especially characteristic of\r\nthe American state, and likely to be overlooked or misunderstood by\r\nEuropeans.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In building the state, the local self-government was left\r\nunimpaired.]\r\n_First_, while we have rapidly built up one of the greatest\r\nempires yet seen upon the earth, we have left our self-government\r\nsubstantially unimpaired in the process. This is exemplified in\r\ntwo ways: first, in the relationship of the state to its towns\r\nand counties, and, secondly, in its relationship to the federal\r\ngovernment. Over the township and county governments the state\r\nexercises a general supervision; indeed, it clothes them with their\r\nauthority. Townships and counties have no sovereignty; the state, on\r\nthe other hand, has many elements of sovereignty, but it does not use\r\nthem to obliterate or unduly restrict the control of the townships\r\nand counties over their own administrative work. It leaves the local\r\ngovernments to administer themselves. As a rule there is only just\r\nenough state supervision to harmonize the working of so many local\r\nadministrations. Such a system of government comes as near as possible\r\ntoward making all American citizens participate actively in the\r\nmanagement of public affairs. It generates and nourishes a public\r\nspirit and a universal acquaintance with matters of public interest\r\nsuch as has probably never before been seen in any great country.\r\nPublic spirit of equal or greater intensity may have been witnessed\r\nin small and highly educated communities, such as ancient Athens or\r\nmediaeval Florence, but in the United States it is diffused over an\r\narea equal to the whole of Europe. Among the leading countries of the\r\nworld England is the one which comes nearest to the United States\r\nin the general diffusion of enlightened public spirit and political\r\ncapacity throughout all classes of society.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Instructive contrast with France.]\r\nA very notable contrast to the self-government which has produced such\r\nadmirable results is to be seen in France, and as contrasts are\r\noften instructive, let me mention one or two features of the French\r\ngovernment. There is nothing like the irregularity and spontaneity\r\nthere that we have observed in our survey of the United States.\r\nEverything is symmetrical. France is divided into eighty-nine\r\n_departments_, most of them larger than the state of Delaware,\r\nsome of them nearly as large as Connecticut, and the administration\r\nof one department is exactly like that of all the others. The chief\r\nofficer of the department is the prefect, who is appointed by\r\nthe minister of the interior at Paris. The prefect is treasurer,\r\nrecruiting officer, school superintendent, all in one, and he appoints\r\nnearly all inferior officers. The department has a council, elected\r\nby universal suffrage, but it has no power of assessing taxes. The\r\ncentral legislature in Paris decides for it how much money it shall\r\nuse and how it shall raise it. The department council is not even\r\nallowed to express its views on political matters; it can only attend\r\nto purely local details of administration.\r\n\r\nThe smallest civil division in France is the _commune_, which may\r\nbe either rural or urban. The commune has a municipal council which\r\nelects a mayor; but when once elected the mayor becomes directly\r\nresponsible to the prefect of the department, and through him to the\r\nminister of the interior. If these greater officers do not like what\r\nthe mayor does, they can overrule his acts or even suspend him from\r\noffice; or upon their complaint the President of the Republic can\r\nremove him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: In France whether it is nominally a despotic empire or a\r\nrepublic at the top, there is scarcely any self-government at the\r\nbottom. Hence government there rests on an insecure foundation.]\r\nThus in France people do not manage their own affairs, but they are\r\nmanaged for them by a hierarchy of officials with its head at Paris.\r\nThis system was devised by the Constituent Assembly in 1790 and\r\nwrought into completeness by Napoleon in 1800. The men who devised\r\nit in 1790 actually supposed that they were inaugurating a system or\r\npolitical freedom(!), and unquestionably it was a vast improvement\r\nupon the wretched system which it supplanted; but as contrasted with\r\nAmerican methods and institutions, it is difficult to call it anything\r\nelse than a highly centralized despotism. It has gone on without\r\nessential change through all the revolutions which have overtaken\r\nFrance since 1800. The people have from time to time overthrown an\r\nunpopular government at Paris, but they have never assumed the direct\r\ncontrol of their own affairs.\r\n\r\nHence it is commonly remarked that while the general intelligence\r\nof the French people is very high, their intelligence in political\r\nmatters is, comparatively speaking, very low. Some persons try to\r\nexplain this by a reference to peculiarities of race. But if we\r\nAmericans were to set about giving to the state governments things\r\nto do that had better be done by counties and towns, and giving the\r\nfederal government things to do that had better be done by the states,\r\nit would not take many generations to dull the keen edge of our\r\npolitical capacity. We should lose it as inevitably as the most\r\nconsummate of pianists will lose his facility if he stops practising.\r\nIt is therefore a fact of cardinal importance that in the United\r\nStates the local governments of township, county, and city are left to\r\nadminister themselves instead of being administered by a great bureau\r\nwith its head at the state capital. In a political society thus\r\nconstituted from the beginning it has proved possible to build up\r\nour Federal Union, in which the states, while for certain purposes\r\nindissolubly united, at the same time for many other purposes retain\r\ntheir self-government intact. As in the case of other aggregates, the\r\nnature of the American political aggregate has been determined by the\r\nnature of its political units.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Vastness of the functions retained by the states in the\r\nAmerican Union.]\r\n_Secondly_, let us observe how great are the functions retained\r\nby our states under the conditions of our Federal Union. The\r\npowers granted to our federal government, such as the control over\r\ninternational questions, war and peace, the military forces, the\r\ncoinage, patents and copyrights, and the regulation of commerce\r\nbetween the states and with foreign countries,--all these are powers\r\nrelating to matters that affect all the states, but could not be\r\nregulated harmoniously by the separate action of the states. In order\r\nthe more completely to debar the states from meddling with such\r\nmatters, they are expressly prohibited from entering into agreements\r\nwith each other or with a foreign power; they cannot engage in war,\r\nsave in case of actual invasion or such imminent danger as admits of\r\nno delay; without consent of Congress they cannot keep a military or\r\nnaval force in time of peace, or impose custom-house duties. Besides\r\nall this they are prohibited from granting titles of nobility, coining\r\nmoney, emitting bills of credit, making anything but gold and silver\r\ncoin a tender in payment of debts, passing bills of attainder, _ex\r\npost facto_ laws, or laws impairing the obligation of contracts.\r\nThe force of these latter restrictions will be explained hereafter.\r\nSuch are the limitations of sovereignty imposed upon the states within\r\nthe Federal Union.\r\n\r\nCompared with the vast prerogatives of the state legislatures, these\r\nlimitations seem small enough. All the civil and religious rights\r\nof our citizens depend upon state legislation; the education of the\r\npeople is in the care of the states; with them rests the regulation\r\nof the suffrage; they prescribe the rules of marriage, the legal\r\nrelations of husband and wife, of parent and child; they determine the\r\npowers of masters over servants and the whole law of principal and\r\nagent, which is so vital a matter in all business transactions; they\r\nregulate partnership, debt and credit, insurance; they constitute all\r\ncorporations, both private and municipal, except such as specially\r\nfulfill the financial or other specific functions of the federal\r\ngovernment; they control the possession, distribution, and use of\r\nproperty, the exercise of trades, and all contract relations; and they\r\nformulate and administer all criminal law, except only that which\r\nconcerns crimes committed against the United States, on the high seas,\r\nor against the law of nations. Space would fail in which to enumerate\r\nthe particulars of this vast range of power; to detail its parts would\r\nbe to catalogue all social and business relationships, to examine all\r\nthe foundations of law and order.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Woodrow Wilson, _The State: Elements of Historical and\r\nPractical Politics_, p. 437.]\r\n\r\nThis enumeration, by Mr. Woodrow Wilson, is so much to the point that I\r\ncontent myself with transcribing it. A very remarkable illustration of\r\nthe preponderant part played by state law in America is given by Mr.\r\nWilson, in pursuance of the suggestion of Mr. Franklin Jameson.[14]\r\nConsider the most important subjects of legislation in England during\r\nthe present century, the subjects which make up almost the entire\r\nconstitutional history of England for eighty years. These subjects are\r\nCatholic emancipation, parliamentary reform, the abolition of slavery,\r\nthe amendment of the poor-laws, the reform of municipal corporations,\r\nthe repeal of the corn laws, the admission of Jews to parliament, the\r\ndisestablishment of the Irish church, the alteration of the Irish land\r\nlaws, the establishment of national education, the introduction of the\r\nballot, and the reform of the criminal law. In the United States only\r\ntwo of these twelve great subjects could be dealt with by the federal\r\ngovernment: the repeal of the corn laws, as being a question of national\r\nrevenue and custom-house duties, and the abolition of slavery, by virtue\r\nof a constitutional amendment embodying some of the results of our Civil\r\nWar. All the other questions enumerated would have to be dealt with by\r\nour state governments; and before the war that was the case with the\r\nslavery question also. A more vivid illustration could not be asked for.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Jameson, \"The Study of the Constitutional\r\nHistory of the States\" _J.H.U. Studies_, IV., v.]\r\n\r\nHow complete is the circle of points in which the state touches the\r\nlife of the American citizen, we may see in the fact that our\r\nstate courts make a complete judiciary system, from top to bottom\r\nindependent of the federal courts.[15] An appeal may be carried from\r\na state court to a federal court in cases which are found to involve\r\npoints of federal law, or in suits arising between citizens of\r\ndifferent states, or where foreign ambassadors are concerned. Except\r\nfor such cases the state courts make up a complete judiciary world of\r\ntheir own, quite outside the sphere of the United States courts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Independence of the state courts.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Constitution of the state courts.]\r\nWe have already had something to say about courts in connection with\r\nthose primitive areas for the administration of justice, the hundred\r\nand the county. In our states there are generally four grades of\r\ncourts. There are, first, the _justices of the peace _, with\r\njurisdiction over \"petty police offences and civil suits for trifling\r\nsums.\" They also conduct preliminary hearings in cases where persons\r\nare accused of serious crimes, and when the evidence seems to warrant\r\nit they may commit the accused person for trial before a higher court.\r\nThe mayor's court in a city usually has jurisdiction similar to that\r\nof justices of the peace. Secondly, there are _county_ and\r\n_municipal courts_, which hear appeals from justices of the peace\r\nand from mayor's courts, and have original jurisdiction over a more\r\nimportant grade of civil and criminal cases. Thirdly, there are\r\n_superior courts_, having original jurisdiction over the most\r\nimportant cases and over wider of the state areas of country, so that\r\nthey do not confine their sessions to one place, but move about from\r\nplace to place, like the English _justices in eyre_. Cases are\r\ncarried up, on appeal, from the lower to the superior court. Fourthly,\r\nthere is in every state a _supreme court_, which generally has no\r\noriginal jurisdiction, but only hears appeals from the decisions of\r\nthe other courts. In New York there is a \"supremest\" court, styled\r\nthe _court of appeals_, which has the power of revising sundry\r\njudgments of the supreme court; and there is something similar in New\r\nJersey, Illinois, Kentucky, and Louisiana.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Wilson. The State, pp. 509-513.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Elective and appointive judges.]\r\nIn the thirteen colonies the judges were appointed by the governor,\r\nwith or without the consent of the council, and they held office\r\nduring life or good behaviour. Among the changes made in our state\r\nconstitutions since the Revolution, there have been few more important\r\nthan those which have affected the position of the judges. In most of\r\nthe states they are now elected by the people for a term of years,\r\nsometimes as short as two years. There is a growing feeling that this\r\nchange was a mistake. It seems to have lowered the general character\r\nof the judiciary. The change was made by reasoning from analogy: it\r\nwas supposed that in a free country all offices ought to be elective\r\nand for short terms. But the case of a judge is not really analogous\r\nto that of executive officers, like mayors and governors and\r\npresidents. The history of popular liberty is much older than the\r\nhistory of the United States, and it would be difficult to point to\r\nan instance in which popular liberty has ever suffered from the\r\nlife tenure of judges. On the contrary, the judge ought to be as\r\nindependent as possible of all transient phases of popular sentiment,\r\nand American experience during the past century seems to teach us that\r\nin the few states where the appointing of judges during life or good\r\nbehaviour has prevailed, the administration of justice has been better\r\nthan in the states where the judges have been elected for specified\r\nterms. Since 1869 there has been a marked tendency toward lengthening\r\nthe terms of elected judges, and in several states there has been a\r\nreturn to the old method of appointing judges by the governor, subject\r\nto confirmation by the senate.[17] It is one of the excellent features\r\nof our system of federal government, that the several states can thus\r\ntry experiments each for itself and learn by comparison of results.\r\nWhen things are all trimmed down to a dead level of uniformity by the\r\ncentral power, as in France, a prolific source of valuable experiences\r\nis cut off and shut up.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: For details, see the admirable monograph of Henry Hitchcock,\r\n_American State Constitutions_, p. 53.]\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

Was there ever a charter government in your state? If so, where is\r\nthe charter at the present time? What is its present value? Try to see\r\nit, if possible. Pupils of Boston and vicinity, for example, may\r\nexamine in the office of the secretary of state, at the state house, the\r\ncharter of King Charles (1629) and that of William and Mary (1692).\r\n\r\n2. When was your state organized under its present government? If it is\r\nnot one of the original thirteen, what was its history previous to\r\norganization; that is, who owned it and controlled it, and how came it\r\nto become a state?\r\n\r\n3. What are the qualifications for voting in your state?\r\n\r\n4. What are the arguments in favour of an educational qualification for\r\nvoters (as, for example, the ability to read the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States)? What reasons might be urged against such qualifications?\r\n\r\n5. Who is the governor of your state? What political party supported him\r\nfor the position? For what ability or eminent service was he selected?\r\n\r\n6. Give illustrations of the governor's exercise of the four functions\r\nof advising, vetoing, pardoning, and commanding (consult the newspapers\r\nwhile the legislature is in session).\r\n\r\n7. Mention some things done by the governor that are not included\r\nin the enumeration of his functions in the text.\r\n\r\n8. Visit, if practicable, the State House. Observe the various offices,\r\nand consider the general nature of the business done there. Attend a\r\nsession of the Senate or the House of Representatives. Obtain some\r\n\"orders of the day.\"\r\n\r\n9. If the legislature is in session, follow its proceedings in the\r\nnewspapers. What important measures are under discussion? On what sort\r\nof questions are party lines pretty sharply drawn? On what sort of\r\nquestions are party distinctions ignored?\r\n\r\n10. Consult the book of general or public statutes, and report on\r\nthe following points:--\r\n\r\n  a. The magnitude of the volume.\r\n  b. Does it contain all the laws? If not, what are omitted?\r\n  c. Give some of the topics dealt with.\r\n  d. Where are the laws to be found that have been made since the printing\r\n     of the volume?\r\n  e. Are the originals of the laws in the volume? If not, where are they\r\n      and in what shape?\r\n\r\n11. Is everybody expected to know all the laws?\r\n\r\n12. Does ignorance of the law excuse one for violating it?\r\n\r\n13. Suppose people desire the legislature to pass some law, as, for\r\nexample, a law requiring towns and cities to provide flags for\r\nschool-houses, how is the attention of the legislature secured? What are\r\nthe various stages through which the bill must pass before it can become\r\na law? Why should there be so many stages?\r\n\r\n14. Give illustrations of the exercise of federal government, state\r\ngovernment, and local government, in your own town or city. Of which\r\ngovernment do you observe the most signs? Of which do you observe the\r\nfewest signs? Of which government do the officers seem most sensitive to\r\nlocal opinion?\r\n\r\n15. Are the sessions of the legislature in your state annual or\r\nbiennial? What is the argument for each system?\r\n\r\nFor answers to numbers 16, 17, 18, and 19, consult the public statutes,\r\na lawyer, or some intelligent business man. A fair idea of the\r\nsuccessive steps in the courts may be obtained from a good unabridged\r\ndictionary by looking up the technical terms employed in these\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\n16. What is the difference between a civil action and a criminal?\r\n\r\n  a. In respect to the object to be gained in each?\r\n  b. In respect to the party that is the plaintiff?\r\n  c. In respect to the consequences to the defendant if the case goes\r\n      against him?\r\n\r\n17. Give an outline of the procedure in a minor criminal action that is\r\ntried without a jury in a lower court. Consider\r\n(1) the complaint, (2) the warrant, (3) the return, (4) the recognizance,\r\n(5) the subpoena, (6) the arraignment, (7) the plea, (8) the testimony,\r\n(9) the arguments,(10) the judgment and sentence, and (11) the penalty and\r\nits enforcement.\r\n\r\nWhat is an appeal?--This procedure seems cumbrous, but it\r\nis founded in common sense. What one of the foregoing steps, for\r\nexample, would you omit? Why?\r\n\r\n18. Give an outline of the procedure in a criminal action that is tried\r\nwith a jury in a higher court. The action is begun in a lower court\r\nwhere the first five stages are the same as in number 17. Then follow\r\n(6) the examination of witnesses, (7) the binding over of the accused to\r\nappear before the higher court for trial, (8) the sending of the\r\ncomplaint and the proceedings thereon to the district or county\r\nattorney, (9) the indictment, (10) the action of the grand jury upon the\r\nindictment, (11) the challenging of jurors before the trial, (12) the\r\narraignment, (13) the plea, (14) the testimony, (15) the arguments, (16)\r\nthe charge to the jury, (17) the verdict, and (18) the sentence, with\r\nits penalty and the enforcement of it. What are \"exceptions?\"--Why\r\nshould there be a jury in the higher court when there is none in the\r\nlower? What is the objection to dispensing with any one of the foregoing\r\nsteps? Does this machinery make it difficult to punish crime? Why should\r\nan accused person receive so much consideration?\r\n\r\n19. Give an outline of the procedure in a minor civil action. Consider\r\n(1) the writ, (2) the attachment, (3) the summons to the defendant, (4)\r\nthe return, (5) the pleading, (6) the testimony, (7) the arguments, (8)\r\nthe judgment or decision of the judge, and (9) the execution.--If the\r\naction is conducted in a higher court, then a jury decides the question\r\nat issue, the judge instructing the jurors in points of law.\r\n\r\n20. Suppose an innocent man is tried for an alleged crime and\r\nacquitted, has he any redress?\r\n\r\n21. Is the enforcement of law complete and satisfactory in your\r\ncommunity?\r\n\r\n22. What is your opinion of the general security of person and property\r\nin your community?\r\n\r\n23. Is there any connection between public sentiment about a law and the\r\nenforcement of that law? If so, what is it?\r\n\r\n24. Any one of the twelve subjects of legislation cited on page 177 may\r\nbe taken as a special topic. Consult any modern history of England.\r\n\r\n25. Which do you regard as the more important possession for the\r\ncitizen,--an acquaintance with the principles and details of government\r\nand law, or a law-abiding and law-supporting spirit? What reasons have\r\nyou for your opinion? Where is your sympathy in times of disorder, with,\r\nthose who defy the law or with those who seek to enforce it? (Suppose a\r\ncase in which you do not approve the law, and then answer.)\r\n\r\n26. May you ever become an officer of the law? Would you as a citizen be\r\njustified in withholding from an officer that obedience and moral\r\nsupport which you as an officer might justly demand from every citizen?\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.\r\n\r\nThe State.--For the founding of the several colonies, their charters,\r\netc., the student may profitably consult the learned monographs in\r\nWinsor's _Narrative and Critical History of America_, 8 vols.,\r\nBoston, 1886-89.

The third point which I had in mind is so\r\nremarkable and important as to require a chapter all to itself. In the\r\nAmerican state the legislature is not supreme, but has limits to its\r\nauthority prescribed by a written document, known as the Constitution;\r\nand if the legislature happens to pass a law which violates the\r\nconstitution, then whenever a specific case happens to arise in which\r\nthis statute is involved, it can be brought before the courts, and\r\nthe decision of the court, if adverse to the statute, annuls it and\r\nrenders it of no effect. The importance of this feature of civil\r\ngovernment in the United States can hardly be overrated. It marks a\r\nmomentous advance in civilization, and it is especially interesting as\r\nbeing peculiarly American. Almost everything else in our fundamental\r\ninstitutions was brought by our forefathers in a more or less highly\r\ndeveloped condition from England; but the development of the written\r\nconstitution, with the consequent relation of the courts to the\r\nlaw-making power, has gone on entirely upon American soil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See above, p. 172.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Germs of the idea of a written constitution.]\r\n[Sidenote: Our indebtedness to the Romans.]\r\n[Sidenote: Mediæval charters.]\r\nThe germs of the written constitution existed a great while ago.\r\nPerhaps it would not be easy to say just when they began to exist.\r\nIt was formerly supposed by such profound thinkers as Locke and such\r\npersuasive writers as Rousseau, that when the first men came together\r\nto live in civil society, they made a sort of contract with one\r\nanother as to what laws they would have, what beliefs they would\r\nentertain, what customs they would sanction, and so forth. This\r\ntheory of the Social Contract was once famous, and exerted a notable\r\ninfluence on political history, and it is still interesting in the\r\nsame way that spinning-wheels and wooden frigates and powdered wigs\r\nare interesting; but we now know that men lived in civil society,\r\nwith complicated laws and customs and creeds, for many thousand years\r\nbefore the notion had ever entered anybody's head that things could\r\nbe regulated by contract. That notion we owe chiefly to the ancient\r\nRomans, and it took them several centuries to comprehend the idea and\r\nput it into practice. We owe them a debt of gratitude for it. The\r\ncustom of regulating business and politics and the affairs of life\r\ngenerally by voluntary but binding agreements is something without\r\nwhich we moderns would not think life worth living. It was after the\r\nRoman world--that is to say, Christendom, for in the Middle Ages the\r\ntwo terms were synonymous--had become thoroughly familiar with the\r\nidea of contract, that the practice grew up of granting written\r\ncharters to towns, or monasteries, or other corporate bodies. The\r\ncharter of a mediaeval town was a kind of written contract by which\r\nthe town obtained certain specified immunities or privileges from the\r\nsovereign or from a great feudal lord, in exchange for some specified\r\nservice which often took the form of a money payment. It was common\r\nenough for a town to buy liberty for hard cash, just as a man might\r\nbuy a farm. The word _charter_ originally meant simply a paper or\r\nwritten document, and it was often applied to deeds for the transfer\r\nof real estate. In contracts of such importance papers or parchment\r\ndocuments were drawn up and carefully preserved as irrefragable\r\nevidences of the transaction. And so, in quite significant phrase the\r\ntowns zealously guarded their charters as the \"title-deeds of their\r\nliberties.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Great Charter\" (1215).]\r\nAfter a while the word charter was applied in England to a particular\r\ndocument which specified certain important concessions forcibly wrung by\r\nthe people from a most unwilling sovereign. This document was called\r\n_Magna Charta_, or the \"Great Charter,\" signed at Runnymede, June 15,\r\n1215, by John, king of England. After the king had signed it and gone\r\naway to his room, he rolled in a mad fury on the floor, screaming\r\ncurses, and gnawing sticks and straw in the impotence of his, wrath.[2]\r\nPerhaps it would be straining words to call a transaction in which the\r\nconsent was so one-sided a \"contract,\" but the idea of Magna Charta was\r\nderived from that of the town charters with which people were already\r\nfamiliar. Thus a charter came to mean \"a grant made by the sovereign\r\neither to the whole people or to a portion of them, securing to them the\r\nenjoyment of certain rights.\" Now in legal usage a charter differs from\r\na constitution in this, that the former is granted by the sovereign,\r\nwhile the latter is established by the people themselves: both are the\r\nfundamental law of the land.[3] a The distinction is admirably\r\nexpressed, but in history it is not always easy to make it. Magna Charta\r\nwas in form a grant by the sovereign, but it was really drawn up by the\r\nbarons, who in a certain sense represented the English people; and\r\nestablished by the people after a long struggle which was only in its\r\nfirst stages in John's time. To some extent it partook of the nature of\r\na written constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Green, _Hist. of the English People_, vol. i. p.\r\n248.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Bouvier, _Law Dictionary_, 12th ed., vol. i. p.\r\n259.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Bill of Rights\" (1689).]\r\nLet us now observe what happened early in 1689, after James II had\r\nfled from England. On January 28th parliament declared the throne\r\nvacant. Parliament then drew up the \"Declaration of Rights,\" a\r\ndocument very similar in purport to the first eight amendments to\r\nour Federal Constitution, and on the 13th of February the two houses\r\noffered the crown to William and Mary on condition of their accepting\r\nthis declaration of the \"true, ancient, and indubitable rights of the\r\npeople of this realm.\" The crown having been accepted on these terms,\r\nparliament in the following December enacted the famous \"Bill of\r\nRights,\" which simply put their previous declaration into the form of\r\na declaratory statute. The Bill of Rights was not--even in form--a\r\ngrant from a sovereign; it was an instrument framed by the\r\nrepresentatives of the people, and without promising to respect\r\nit William and Mary could no more have mounted the throne than a\r\npresident of the United States could be inducted into office if he\r\nwere to refuse to take the prescribed oath of allegiance to the\r\nFederal Constitution. The Bill of Rights was therefore, strictly\r\nspeaking, a piece of written constitution; it was a constitution as\r\nfar as it went.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Foreshadowing of the American idea by Sir Harry Vane\r\n(1656).]\r\nThe seventeenth century, the age when the builders of American\r\ncommonwealths were coming from England, was especially notable in\r\nEngland for two things. One was the rapid growth of modern commercial\r\noccupations and habits, the other was the temporary overthrow of\r\nmonarchy, soon followed by the final subjection of the crown to\r\nparliament. Accordingly the sphere of contract and the sphere of\r\npopular sovereignty were enlarged in men's minds, and the notion of a\r\nwritten constitution first began to find expression. The \"Instrument\r\nof Government\" which in 1653 created the protectorate of Oliver\r\nCromwell was substantially a written constitution, but it emanated\r\nfrom a questionable authority and was not ratified. It was drawn up\r\nby a council of army officers; and \"it broke down because the first\r\nparliament summoned under it refused to acknowledge its binding\r\nforce.\" [4] The dissolution of this parliament accordingly left Oliver\r\nabsolute dictator. In 1656, when it seemed so necessary to decide what\r\nsort of government the dictatorship of Cromwell was to prepare the way\r\nfor, Sir Harry Vane proposed that a _national convention_ should\r\nbe called for drawing up a written constitution.[5] The way in which\r\nhe stated his case showed that he had in him a prophetic foreshadowing\r\nof the American idea as it was realized in 1787. But Vane's ideas were\r\ntoo far in advance of his age to be realized then in England. Older\r\nideas, to which men were more accustomed, determined the course of\r\nevents there, and it was left for Americans to create a government by\r\nmeans of a written constitution. And when American statesmen did so,\r\nthey did it without any reference to Sir Harry Vane. His relation to\r\nthe subject has been discovered only in later days, but I mention him\r\nhere in illustration of the way in which great institutions grow. They\r\ntake shape when they express the opinions and wishes of a multitude\r\nof persons; but it often happens that one or two men of remarkable\r\nforesight had thought of them long beforehand.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Gardiner, _Constitutional Documents of the Puritan\r\nRevolution_, p. lx.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: See Hosmer's _Young Sir Henry Vane_, pp.\r\n432-444,--one of the best books ever written for the reader who wishes\r\nto understand the state of mind among the English people in the crisis\r\nwhen they laid the foundations of the United States.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Mayflower compact(1620).]\r\nIn America the first attempts at written constitutions were in the\r\nfullest sense made by the people, and not through representatives but\r\ndirectly. In the Mayflower's cabin, before the Pilgrims had landed on\r\nPlymouth rock, they subscribed their names to a compact in which they\r\nagreed to constitute themselves into a \"body politic,\" and to enact such\r\nlaws as might be deemed best for the colony they were about to\r\nestablish; and they promised \"all due submission and obedience\" to such\r\nlaws. Such a compact is of course too vague to be called a constitution.\r\nProperly speaking, a written constitution is a document which defines\r\nthe character and powers of the government to which its framers are\r\nwilling to entrust themselves. Almost any kind of civil government might\r\nhave been framed under the Mayflower compact, but the document is none\r\nthe less interesting as an indication of the temper of the men who\r\nsubscribed their names to it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Fundamental Orders of Connecticut\" (1639).]\r\nThe first written constitution known to history was that by which the\r\nrepublic of Connecticut was organized in 1639. At first the affairs\r\nof the Connecticut settlements had been directed by a commission\r\nappointed by the General Court of Massachusetts, but on the 14th of\r\nJanuary, 1639, all the freemen of the three river towns--Windsor,\r\nHartford, and Wethersfield--assembled at Hartford, and drew up a\r\nwritten constitution, consisting of eleven articles, in which the\r\nframe of government then and there adopted was distinctly described.\r\nThis document, known as the \"Fundamental Orders of Connecticut\",\r\ncreated the government under which the people of Connecticut lived for\r\nnearly two centuries before they deemed it necessary to amend it. The\r\ncharter granted to Connecticut by Charles II. in 1662 was simply a\r\nroyal recognition of the government actually in operation since the\r\nadoption of the Fundamental Orders.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Germinal development of the colonial charter toward the\r\nmodern state constitution.]\r\nIn those colonies which had charters these documents served, to a\r\ncertain extent, the purposes of a written constitution. They limited the\r\nlegislative powers of the colonial assemblies. The question sometimes\r\ncame up as to whether some statute made by the assembly was not in\r\nexcess of the powers conferred by the charter. This question usually\r\narose in connection with some particular law case, and thus came before\r\nthe courts for settlement,--first before the courts of the colony;\r\nafterwards it might sometimes be carried on appeal before the Privy\r\nCouncil in England. If the court decided that the statute was in\r\ntransgression of the charter, the statute was thereby annulled.[6] The\r\ncolonial legislature, therefore, was not a supreme body, even within the\r\ncolony; its authority was restricted by the terms of the charter. Thus\r\nthe Americans, for more than a century before the Revolution, were\r\nfamiliarized with the idea of a legislature as a representative body\r\nacting within certain limits prescribed by a written document. They had\r\nno knowledge or experience of a supreme legislative body, such as the\r\nHouse of Commons has become since the founders of American states left\r\nEngland. At the time of the Revolution, when the several states framed\r\nnew governments, they simply put a written constitution into the\r\nposition of supremacy formerly occupied by the charter. Instead of a\r\ndocument expressed in terms of a royal grant, they adopted a document\r\nexpressed in terms of a popular edict. To this the legislature must\r\nconform; and people were already somewhat familiar with the method of\r\ntesting the constitutionality of a law by getting the matter brought\r\nbefore the courts. The mental habit thus generated was probably more\r\nimportant than any other single circumstance in enabling our Federal\r\nUnion to be formed. Without it, indeed, it would have been impossible to\r\nform a durable union.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Bryce, _American Commonwealth_, vol. i. pp. 243,\r\n415.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Abnormal development of the state constitution, encroaching\r\nupon the province of the legislature.]\r\n[Sidenote: The Swiss \"Referendum\" 196]\r\nBefore pursuing this subject, we may observe that American state\r\nconstitutions have altered very much in character since the first part\r\nof the present century. The earlier constitutions were confined to a\r\ngeneral outline of the organization of the government. They did not\r\nundertake to make the laws, but to prescribe the conditions under\r\nwhich laws might be made and executed. Recent state constitutions\r\nenter more and more boldly upon the general work of legislation. For\r\nexample, in some states they specify what kinds of property shall be\r\nexempt from seizure for debt, they make regulations as to railroad\r\nfreight-charges, they prescribe sundry details of practice in the\r\ncourts, or they forbid the sale of intoxicating liquors. Until\r\nrecently such subjects would have been left to the legislatures, no\r\none would have thought of putting them into a constitution. The motive\r\nin so doing is a wish to put certain laws into such a shape that it\r\nwill be difficult to repeal them. What a legislature sees fit to enact\r\nthis year it may see fit to repeal next year. But amending a state\r\nconstitution is a slow and cumbrous process. An amendment may be\r\noriginated in the legislature, where it must secure more than a mere\r\nmajority--perhaps a three fifths or two thirds vote--in order to pass;\r\nin some states it must be adopted by two successive legislatures,\r\nperhaps by two thirds of one and three fourths of the next; in some\r\nstates not more than one amendment can be brought before the same\r\nlegislature; in some it is provided that amendments must not be\r\nsubmitted to the people oftener than once in five years; and so\r\non. After the amendment has at length made its way through the\r\nlegislature, it must be ratified by a vote of the people at the next\r\ngeneral election. Another way to get a constitution amended is to call\r\na convention for that purpose. In order to call a convention, it is\r\nusually necessary to obtain a two thirds vote in the legislature; but\r\nin some states the legislature is required at stated intervals to\r\nsubmit to the people the question of holding such a convention, as\r\nin New Hampshire every seven years; in Iowa, every ten years; in\r\nMichigan, every sixteen years; in New York, Ohio, Maryland, and\r\nVirginia, every twenty years.[7] A convention is a representative\r\nbody elected by the people to meet at some specified time and\r\nplace for some specified purpose, and its existence ends with the\r\naccomplishment of that purpose. It is in this occasional character\r\nthat the convention differs from an ordinary legislative assembly.\r\nWith such elaborate checks against hasty action, it is to be presumed\r\nthat if a law can be once embodied in a state constitution, it will be\r\nlikely to have some permanence. Moreover, a direct vote by the people\r\ngives a weightier sanction to a law than a vote in the legislature.\r\nThere is also, no doubt, a disposition to distrust legislatures and in\r\nsome measure do their work for them by direct popular enactment. For\r\nsuch reasons some recent state constitutions have come almost to\r\nresemble bodies of statutes. Mr. Woodrow Wilson suggestively compares\r\nthis kind of popular legislation with the Swiss practice known as the\r\n_Referendum_; in most of the Swiss cantons an important act of\r\nthe legislature does not acquire the force of law until it has been\r\n_referred_ to the people and voted on by them. \"The objections\r\nto the, _referendum_,\"  says Mr. Wilson, \"are, of course, that it\r\nassumes a discriminating judgment and a fullness of information on the\r\npart of the people touching questions of public policy which they do\r\nnot often possess, and that it lowers the sense of responsibility on\r\nthe part of legislators.\"  [8] Another serious objection to our recent\r\npractice is that it tends to confuse the very valuable distinction\r\nbetween a constitution and a body of statutes, to necessitate a\r\nfrequent revision of constitutions, and to increase the cumbrousness\r\nof law-making. It would, however, be premature at the present time to\r\npronounce confidently upon a practice of such recent origin. It is\r\nclear that its tendency is extremely democratic, and that it implies\r\na high standard of general intelligence and independence among the\r\npeople. If the evils of the practice are found to outweigh its\r\nbenefits, it will doubtless fall into disfavour.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See Henry Hitchcock's admirable monograph, _American\r\nState Constitutions_, p. 19.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Wilson.

Has the society\r\nrules apart from the constitution? Which may be changed the more\r\nreadily? Why not put all the rules into the constitution?\r\n\r\n2. Read the constitution of your state in part or in full. Give some\r\naccount of its principal divisions, of the topics it deals with, and its\r\nmagnitude or fullness. Are there any amendments? If so, mention two or\r\nthree, and give the reasons for their adoption. Is there any declaration\r\nof rights in it? If so, what are some of the rights declared, and whose\r\nare they said to be?\r\n\r\n3. Where is the original of your state constitution kept? What sort of\r\nlooking document do you suppose it to be? Where would you look for a\r\ncopy of it? If a question arises in any court about the interpretation\r\nof the constitution, must the original be produced to settle the wording\r\nof the document?\r\n\r\n4. Has any effort been made in your state to put into the constitution\r\nmatters that have previously been subjects of legislative action? If so,\r\ngive an account of the effort, and the public attitude towards it.\r\n\r\n5. Which is preferable,--a constitution that commands the approval of\r\nthe people as a whole or that which has the support of a dominant\r\npolitical party only?\r\n\r\n6. Suppose it is your personal conviction that a law is\r\nunconstitutional, may you disregard it? What consequences might ensue\r\nfrom such disregard?\r\n\r\n7. May people honestly and amicably differ about the interpretation of\r\nthe constitution or of a law, in a particular case? If important\r\ninterests are dependent on the interpretation, how can the true one be\r\nfound out? Does a lawyer's opinion settle the interpretation? What value\r\nhas such an opinion? Where must people go for authoritative and final\r\ninterpretations of the laws? Can they get such interpretations by simply\r\nasking for them?\r\n\r\n8. The constitution of New Hampshire provides that when the governor\r\ncannot discharge the duties of his office, the president of the senate\r\nshall assume them. During the severe sickness of a governor recently,\r\nthe president of the senate hesitated to act in his stead; it was not\r\nclear that the situation was grave enough to warrant such a course.\r\nAccordingly the attorney-general of the state brought an action against\r\nthe president of the senate for not doing his duty; the court considered\r\nthe situation, decided against the president of the senate, and ordered\r\nhim to become acting governor. Why was this suit necessary? Was it\r\nconducted in a hostile spirit? Wherein did the decision help the state?\r\nWherein did it help the defendant? Wherein may it possibly prove helpful\r\nin the future history of the state?\r\n\r\n9. Mention particular things that the governor, the legislature, and the\r\njudiciary of your state have done or may do. Then find the section or\r\nclause or wording in your state constitution that gives authority for\r\neach of these things. For example, read the particular part that\r\nauthorizes your legislature:--\r\n\r\n  a. To incorporate a city.\r\n  b. To compel children to attend school.\r\n  c. To buy uniforms for a regiment of soldiers.\r\n  d. To establish a death penalty.\r\n  e. To send a committee abroad to study a system of waterworks.\r\n\r\n10. Trace the authority of a school-teacher, a policeman, a selectman, a\r\nmayor, or of any public officer, back to some part of your constitution.\r\n\r\n11. Mention any parts of your constitution that seem general and\r\nsomewhat indefinite, and that admit, therefore, of much freedom in\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n12. Show how the people are, in one aspect, subordinate to the\r\nconstitution; in another, superior to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHICAL NOTE.\r\n\r\nWritten Constitutions.--Very little has been written or published with\r\nreference to the history of the development of the idea of a written\r\nconstitution.

We have\r\nalready described so much of the civil government in operation in the\r\nUnited States that this account can be made much more concise than if we\r\nhad started at the top instead of the bottom and begun to portray our\r\nnational government before saying a word about states and counties and\r\ntowns. Bit by bit the general theory of American self-government has\r\nalready been set before the reader. We have now to observe, in\r\nconclusion, what a magnificent piece of constructive work has been\r\nperformed in accordance with that general theory. We have to observe the\r\nbuilding up of a vast empire out of strictly self-governing elements.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: English institutions in all the colonies.]\r\nThere was always one important circumstance in favour of the union of\r\nthe thirteen American colonies into a federal nation. The inhabitants\r\nwere all substantially one people. It is true that in some of the\r\ncolonies there were a good many persons not of English ancestry, but\r\nthe English type absorbed and assimilated everything else.\r\n\r\nAll spoke the English language, all had English institutions. Except\r\nthe development of the written constitution, every bit of civil\r\ngovernment described in the preceding pages came to America directly\r\nfrom England, and not a bit of it from any other country, unless by\r\nbeing first filtered through England. Our institutions were as English\r\nas our speech. It was therefore comparatively easy for people in one\r\ncolony to understand people in another, not only as to their words but\r\nas to their political ideas. Moreover, during the first half of the\r\neighteenth century, the common danger from the aggressive French\r\nenemy on the north and west went far toward awakening in the thirteen\r\ncolonies a common interest. And after the French enemy had been\r\nremoved, the assertion by parliament of its alleged right to tax the\r\nAmericans threatened all the thirteen legislatures at once, and thus\r\nin fact drove the colonies into a kind of federal union.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The New England confederacy (1643-84).]\r\n[Sidenote: Albany Congress(1754).]\r\n[Sidenote: Stamp Act Congress (1765).]\r\nConfederations among states have generally owed their origin, in\r\nthe first instance, to military necessities. The earliest league in\r\nAmerica, among white people at least, was the confederacy of New\r\nEngland colonies formed in 1643, chiefly for defence against the\r\nIndians. It was finally dissolved amid the troubles of 1684, when the\r\nfirst government of Massachusetts was overthrown. Along the Atlantic\r\ncoast the northern and the southern colonies were for some time\r\ndistinct groups, separated by the unsettled portion of the central\r\nzone. The settlement of Pennsylvania, beginning in 1681, filled this\r\ngap and made the colonies continuous from the French frontier of\r\nCanada to the Spanish frontier of Florida. The danger from France\r\nbegan to be clearly apprehended after 1689, and in 1698 one of the\r\nearliest plans of union was proposed by William Penn. In 1754, just\r\nas the final struggle with France was about to begin, there came\r\nFranklin's famous plan for a permanent federal union; and this plan\r\nwas laid before a congress assembled at Albany for renewing the\r\nalliances with the Six Nations.[1] Only seven colonies were\r\nrepresented in this congress. Observe the word \"congress.\" If it\r\nhad been a legislative body it would more likely have been called\r\na \"parliament.\" But of course it was nothing of the sort. It was a\r\ndiplomatic body, composed of delegates representing state governments,\r\nlike European congresses,--like the Congress of Berlin, for example,\r\nwhich tried to adjust the Eastern Question in 1878. Eleven years after\r\nthe Albany Congress, upon the news that parliament had passed the\r\nStamp Act, a congress of nine colonies assembled at New York in\r\nOctober, 1765, to take action thereon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Franklin's plan was afterward submitted to the several\r\nlegislatures of the colonies, and was everywhere rejected because the\r\nneed for union was nowhere strongly felt by the people.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Committees of Correspondence (1772-75).]\r\nNine years elapsed without another congress. Meanwhile the political\r\nexcitement, with occasional lulls, went on increasing, and some sort\r\nof cooperation between the colonial governments became habitual. In\r\n1768, after parliament had passed the Townshend revenue acts, there\r\nwas no congress, but Massachusetts sent a circular letter to the other\r\ncolonies, inviting them to cooperate in measures of resistance, and\r\nthe other colonies responded favourably. In 1772, as we have seen,\r\ncommittees of correspondence between the towns of Massachusetts acted\r\nas a sort of provisional government for the commonwealth. In 1773\r\nDabney Carr, of Virginia, enlarged upon this idea, and committees of\r\ncorrespondence were forthwith instituted between the several colonies.\r\nThus the habit of acting in concert began to be formed. In 1774,\r\nafter parliament had passed an act overthrowing the government of\r\nMassachusetts, along with other offensive measures, a congress\r\nassembled in September at Philadelphia, the city most centrally\r\nsituated as well as the largest. If the remonstrances adopted at this\r\ncongress had been heeded by the British government, and peace had\r\nfollowed, this congress would probably have been as temporary an\r\naffair as its predecessors; people would probably have waited until\r\novertaken by some other emergency. But inasmuch as war followed,\r\nthe congress assembled again in May, 1775, and thereafter became\r\npractically a permanent institution until it died of old age with the\r\nyear 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Continental Congress (1774-1789).]\r\nThis congress was called \"continental\" to distinguish it from the\r\n\"provincial congresses\" held in several of the colonies at about the\r\nsame time. The thirteen colonies were indeed but a narrow strip on the\r\nedge of a vast and in large part unexplored continent, but the word\r\n\"continental\" was convenient for distinguishing between the whole\r\nconfederacy and its several members.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The several states were never at any time sovereign\r\nstates.]\r\n[Sidenote: The Articles of Confederation]\r\nThe Continental Congress began to exercise a certain amount of\r\ndirective authority from the time of its first meeting in 1774. Such\r\nauthority as it had arose simply from the fact that it represented an\r\nagreement on the part of the several governments to pursue a certain\r\nline of policy. It was a diplomatic and executive, but scarcely yet a\r\nlegislative body. Nevertheless it was the visible symbol of a kind of\r\nunion between the states. There never was a time when any one of the\r\noriginal states exercised singly the full powers of sovereignty. Not\r\none of them was ever a small sovereign state like Denmark or Portugal.\r\nAs they acted together under the common direction of the British\r\ngovernment in 1759, the year of Quebec, so they acted together under\r\nthe common direction of that revolutionary body, the Continental\r\nCongress, in 1775, the year of Bunker Hill. In that year a\r\n\"continental army\" was organized in the name of the \"United Colonies.\"\r\nIn the following year, when independence was declared, it was done\r\nby the concerted action of all the colonies; and at the same time a\r\ncommittee was appointed by Congress to draw up a written constitution.\r\nThis constitution, known as the \"Articles or Confederation,\" was\r\nsubmitted to Congress in the autumn of 1777, and was sent to the\r\nseveral states to be ratified. A unanimous ratification was necessary,\r\nand it was not until March 1781, that unanimity was secured and the\r\narticles adopted.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Revolutionary War had advanced into its last stages,\r\nhaving been carried on from the outset under the general direction\r\nof the Continental Congress. When reading about this period of our\r\nhistory, the student must be careful not to be misled by the name\r\n\"congress\" into reasoning as if there were any resemblance whatever\r\nbetween that body and the congress which was created by our Federal\r\nConstitution. The Continental Congress was not the parent of our\r\nFederal Congress; the former died without offspring, and the latter\r\nhad a very different origin, as we shall soon see. The former simply\r\nbequeathed to the latter a name, that was all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nature and powers of the Continental Congress]\r\nThe Continental Congress was an assembly of delegates from the thirteen\r\nstates, which from 1774 to 1783 held its sessions at Philadelphia.[2] It\r\nowned no federal property, not even the house in which it assembled, and\r\nafter it had been turned out of doors by a mob of drunken soldiers in\r\nJune, 1783, it flitted about from place to place, sitting now at\r\nTrenton, now at Annapolis, and finally at New York.[3] Each state sent\r\nto it as many delegates as it chose, though after the adoption of the\r\narticles no state could send less than two or more than seven. Each\r\nstate had one vote, and it took nine votes, or two thirds of the whole,\r\nto carry any measure of importance. One of the delegates was chosen\r\npresident or chairman of the congress, and this position was one of\r\ngreat dignity and considerable influence, but it was not essentially\r\ndifferent from the position, of any of the other delegates. There were\r\nno distinct executive officers. Important executive matters were at\r\nfirst assigned to committees, such as the Finance Committee and the\r\nBoard of War, though at the most trying time the finance committee was a\r\ncommittee of one, in the person of Robert Morris, who was commonly\r\ncalled the Financier. The work of the finance committee was chiefly\r\ntrying to solve the problem of paying bills without spending money, for\r\nthere was seldom any money to spend. Congress could not tax the people\r\nor recruit the army. When it wanted money or troops, it could only ask\r\nthe state governments for them; and generally it got from a fifth to a\r\nfourth part of the troops needed, but of money a far smaller proportion.\r\nSometimes it borrowed money from Holland or France, but often its only\r\nresource was to issue paper promises to pay, or the so-called\r\nContinental paper money. There were no federal courts,[4] nor marshals\r\nto execute federal decrees. Congress might issue orders, but it had no\r\nmeans of compelling obedience.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Except for a few days in December, 1776, when it fled\r\nto Baltimore; and again from September, 1777, to June, 1778, when\r\nPhiladelphia was in possession of the British; during that interval\r\nCongress held its meetings at York in Pennsylvania.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See my _Critical Period of American History_, pp.\r\n112, 271, 306]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Except the \"Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture,\" for\r\nan admirable account of which see Jameson's _Essays in the\r\nConstitutional History of the United States_, pp. 1-45.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: It was not fully endowed with sovereignty.]\r\nThe Continental Congress was therefore not in the full sense a\r\nsovereign body. A government is not really a government until it can\r\nimpose taxes and thus command the money needful for keeping it in\r\nexistence. Nevertheless the Congress exercised some of the most\r\nindisputable functions of sovereignty. \"It declared the independence\r\nof the United States; it contracted an offensive and defensive\r\nalliance with France; it raised and organized a Continental army; it\r\nborrowed large sums of money, and pledged what the lenders understood\r\nto be the national credit for their repayment; it issued an\r\ninconvertible paper currency, granted letters of marque, and built a\r\nnavy.\" [6] Finally it ratified a treaty of peace with Great Britain. So\r\nthat the Congress was really, in many respects, and in the eyes of the\r\nworld at large, a sovereign body. Time soon showed that the continued\r\nexercise of such powers was not compatible with the absence of the\r\npower to tax the people. In truth the situation of the Continental\r\nCongress was an illogical situation. In the effort of throwing off\r\nthe sovereignty of Great Britain, the people of these states were\r\nconstructing a federal union faster than they realized. Their theory\r\nof the situation did not keep pace with the facts, and their first\r\nattempt to embody their theory, in the Articles of Confederation, was\r\nnot unnaturally a failure.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Critical Period_, p. 93.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Decline of the Continental Congress.]\r\nAt first the powers of the Congress were vague. They were what are\r\ncalled \"implied war powers;\" that is to say, the Congress had a war\r\nwith Great Britain on its hands, and must be supposed to have power to\r\ndo whatever was necessary to bring the war to a successful conclusion.\r\nAt first, too, when it had only begun to issue paper money, there\r\nwas a momentary feeling of prosperity. Military success added to its\r\nappearance of strength, and the reputation of the Congress reached its\r\nhigh water mark early in 1778, after the capture of Burgoyne's army\r\nand the making of the alliance with France. After that time, with the\r\nweary prolonging of the war, the increase of the public debt, and the\r\ncollapse of the paper currency, its reputation steadily declined.\r\nThere was also much work to be done in reorganizing the state\r\ngovernments, and this kept at home in the state legislatures many of\r\nthe ablest men who would otherwise have been sent to the Congress.\r\nThus in point of intellectual capacity the latter body was distinctly\r\ninferior in 1783 to what it had been when first assembled nine years\r\nearlier.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anarchical tendencies.]\r\nThe arrival of peace did not help the Congress, but made matters worse.\r\nWhen the absolute necessity of presenting a united front to the common\r\nenemy was removed, the weakness of the union was shown in many\r\nways that were alarming. The _sentiment_ of union was weak. In spite of\r\nthe community in language and institutions, which was so favourable to\r\nunion, the people of the several states had many local prejudices which\r\ntended to destroy the union in its infancy. A man was quicker to\r\nremember that he was a New Yorker or a Massachusetts man than that he\r\nwas an American and a citizen of the United States. Neighbouring states\r\nlevied custom-house duties against one another, or refused to admit into\r\ntheir markets each other's produce, or had quarrels about boundaries\r\nwhich went to the verge of war. Things grew worse every year until by\r\nthe autumn of 1786, when the Congress was quite bankrupt and most of the\r\nstates nearly so, when threats of secession were heard both in New\r\nEngland and in the South, when there were riots in several states and\r\nMassachusetts was engaged in suppressing armed rebellion, when people in\r\nEurope were beginning to ask whether we were more likely to be seized\r\nupon by France or reconquered piecemeal by Great Britain, it came to be\r\nthought necessary to make some kind of a change.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Federal Convention (1787).]\r\n\r\nMen were most unwillingly brought to this conclusion, because they were\r\nused to their state assemblies and not afraid of them, but they were\r\nafraid of increasing the powers of any government superior to the states,\r\nlest they should thus create an unmanageable tyranny. They believed that\r\neven anarchy, though a dreadful evil, is not so dreadful as despotism,\r\nand for this view there is much to be said. After no end of trouble a\r\nconvention was at length got together at Philadelphia in May, 1787, and\r\nafter four months of work with closed doors, it was able to offer to the\r\ncountry the new Federal Constitution. Both in its character and in\r\nthe work which It did, this Federal Convention, over which Washington\r\npresided, and of which Franklin, Madison, and Hamilton were members,\r\nwas one of the most remarkable deliberative bodies known to history.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the fundamental weakness of the Continental Congress\r\nlay in the fact that it could not tax the people. Hence although it\r\ncould for a time exert other high functions of sovereignty, it could\r\nonly do so while money was supplied to it from other sources than\r\ntaxation; from contributions made by the states in answer to its\r\n\"requisitions,\" from foreign loans, and from a paper currency. But such\r\nresources could not last long. It was like a man's trying to live upon\r\nhis own promissory notes and upon gifts and unsecured loans from his\r\nfriends. When the supply of money was exhausted, the Congress soon found\r\nthat it could no longer comport itself as a sovereign power; it could\r\nnot preserve order at home, and the situation abroad may be illustrated\r\nby the fact that George III. kept garrisons in several of our\r\nnorthwestern frontier towns and would not send a minister to the United\r\nStates. This example shows that, among the sovereign powers of a\r\ngovernment, the power of taxation is the fundamental one upon which all\r\nthe others depend. Nothing can go on without money.\r\n\r\nBut the people of the several states would never consent to grant the\r\npower of taxation, to such a body as the Continental Congress, in\r\nwhich they were not represented. The Congress was not a legislature,\r\nbut a diplomatic body; it did not represent the people, but the state\r\ngovernments; and a large state like Pennsylvania had no more weight in\r\nit than a little state like Delaware. If there was to be any central\r\nassembly for the whole union, endowed with the power of taxation,\r\nit must be an assembly representing the American people just as the\r\nassembly of a single state represented the people of the state.\r\n\r\nAs soon as this point became clear, it was seen to be necessary to\r\nthrow the Articles of Confederation overboard, and construct a new\r\nnational government. As was said above, our Federal Congress is not\r\ndescended from the Continental Congress. Its parentage is to be sought\r\nin the state legislatures. Our federal government was constructed\r\nafter the general model of the state governments, with some points\r\ncopied from British usages, and some points that were original and\r\nnew.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

It is an\r\nassembly representing the whole population of the country as if it were\r\nall in one great state. It is composed of members chosen every other\r\nyear by the people of the states. Persons in any state who are qualified\r\nto vote for state representatives are qualified to vote for federal\r\nrepresentatives. This arrangement left the power of regulating the\r\nsuffrage in the hands of the several states, where it still remains,\r\nsave for the restriction imposed in 1870 for the protection of the\r\nsouthern freedmen. A candidate for election to the House of\r\nRepresentatives must be twenty-five years old, must have been seven\r\nyears a citizen of the United States, and must be an inhabitant of the\r\nstate in which he is chosen.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The three fifths compromise.]\r\nAs the Federal Congress is a taxing body, representatives and direct\r\ntaxes are apportioned among the several states according to the same\r\nrule, that is, according to population. At this point a difficulty\r\narose in the Convention as to whether slaves should be counted as\r\npopulation. If they were to be counted, the relative weight of the\r\nslave states in all matters of national legislation would be much\r\nincreased. The northern states thought, with reason, that it would\r\nbe unduly increased. The difficulty was adjusted by a compromise\r\naccording to which five slaves were to be reckoned as three persons.\r\nSince the abolition of slavery this provision has become obsolete, but\r\nuntil 1860 it was a very important factor in American history.[7]\r\n\r\nIn the federal House of Representatives the great states of course\r\nhave much more weight than the small states. In 1790 the four largest\r\nstates had 32 representatives, while the other nine had only 33. The\r\nlargest state, Virginia, had 10 representatives to 1 from Delaware.\r\nThese disparities have increased. In 1880, out of thirty-eight states\r\nthe nine largest had a majority of the house, and the largest state,\r\nNew York, had 34 representatives to 1 from Delaware.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: See my _Critical Period_, pp. 257-262.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Connecticut compromise]\r\nThis feature of the House of Representatives caused\r\nthe smaller states in the Convention to oppose the whole scheme of\r\nconstructing a new government. They were determined that great and\r\nsmall states should have equal weight in Congress. Their steadfast\r\nopposition threatened to ruin everything, when fortunately a method\r\nof compromise was discovered. It was intended that the national\r\nlegislature, in imitation of the state legislatures, should have an\r\nupper house or senate; and at first the advocates of a strong national\r\ngovernment proposed that the senate also should represent population,\r\nthus differing from the lower house only in the way in which we have\r\nseen that it generally differed in the several states. But it happened\r\nthat in the state of Connecticut the custom was peculiar. There it\r\nhad always been the custom to elect the governor and upper house by a\r\nmajority vote of the whole people, while for each township there was\r\nan equality of representation In the lower house. The Connecticut\r\ndelegates in the Convention, therefore, being familiar with a\r\nlegislature in which the two houses were composed on different\r\nprinciples, suggested a compromise. Let the House of Representatives,\r\nthey said, represent the people, and let the Senate represent the\r\nstates; let all the states, great and small, be represented equally\r\nin the federal Senate. Such was the famous \"Connecticut Compromise.\"\r\nWithout it the Convention would probably have broken up without\r\naccomplishing anything. When it was adopted, half the work of making\r\nthe new government was done, for the small states, having had their\r\nfears thus allayed by the assurance that they were to be equally\r\nrepresented in the Senate, no longer opposed the work but cooperated\r\nin it most zealously.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Senate]\r\nThus it came to pass that the upper house of our national legislature\r\nis composed of two senators from each state. As they represent the\r\nstate, they are chosen by its legislature and not by the people; but\r\nwhen they have taken their seats in the senate they do not vote\r\nby states, like the delegates in the Continental Congress. On the\r\ncontrary each senator has one vote, and the two senators from the same\r\nstate may, and often do, vote on opposite sides.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the notion that an upper house should be somewhat\r\nless democratic than a lower house, the term of office for senators\r\nwas made longer than for representatives. The tendency is to make the\r\nSenate respond more slowly to changes in popular sentiment, and\r\nthis is often an advantage. Popular opinion is often very wrong at\r\nparticular moments, but with time it is apt to correct its mistakes.\r\nWe are usually in more danger of suffering from hasty legislation than\r\nfrom tardy legislation. Senators are chosen for a term of six years,\r\nand one third of the number of terms expire every second year, so\r\nthat, while the whole Senate may be renewed by the lapse of six years,\r\nthere is never a \"new Senate.\" The Senate has thus a continuous\r\nexistence and a permanent organization; whereas each House of\r\nRepresentatives expires at the end of its two years' term, and is\r\nsucceeded by a \"new House,\" which requires to be organized by electing\r\nits officers, etc., before proceeding to business. A candidate for the\r\nsenatorship must have reached the age of thirty, must have been nine\r\nyears a citizen of the United States, and must be an inhabitant of the\r\nstate which he represents.\r\n\r\nThe constitution leaves the times, places, and manner of holding\r\nelections for senators and representatives to be prescribed in each\r\nstate by its own legislature; but it gives to Congress the power to\r\nalter such regulations, except as to the place of choosing senators.\r\n\r\nHere we see a vestige of the original theory according to which the\r\nSenate was to be peculiarly the home of state rights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Electoral districts.]\r\n[Sidenote: \"Gerrymandering.\"]\r\nIn the composition of the House of Representatives the state\r\nlegislatures play a very important part. For the purposes of the\r\nelection a state is divided into districts corresponding to the number\r\nof representatives the state is entitled to send to Congress. These\r\nelectoral districts are marked out by the legislature, and the division\r\nis apt to be made by the preponderating party with an unfairness that is\r\nat once shameful and ridiculous. The aim, of course, is so to lay out\r\nthe districts as to secure in the greatest possible number of them a\r\nmajority for the party which conducts the operation. This is done\r\nsometimes by throwing the greatest possible number of hostile voters\r\ninto a district which is anyhow certain to be hostile, sometimes by\r\nadding to a district where parties are equally divided some place in\r\nwhich the majority of friendly voters is sufficient to turn the scale.\r\nThere is a district in Mississippi (the so-called Shoe String district)\r\n250 miles long by 30 broad, and another in Pennsylvania resembling a\r\ndumb-bell.... In Missouri a district has been contrived longer, if\r\nmeasured along its windings, than the state itself, into which as large\r\na number as possible of the negro voters have been thrown.[8] This\r\ntrick is called \"gerrymandering,\" from Elbridge Gerry, of Massachusetts,\r\nwho was vice-president of the United States from 1813 to 1817. It seems\r\nto have been first devised in 1788 by the enemies of the Federal\r\nConstitution in Virginia, in order to prevent the election of James\r\nMadison to the first Congress, and fortunately it was unsuccessful.[9]\r\nIt was introduced some years afterward into Massachusetts. In 1812,\r\nwhile Gerry was governor of that state, the Republican legislature\r\nredistributed the districts in such wise that the shapes of the towns\r\nforming a single district in Essex county gave to the district a\r\nsomewhat dragon-like contour. This was indicated upon a map of\r\nMassachusetts which Benjamin Russell, an ardent Federalist and editor of\r\nthe \"Centinel,\" hung up over the desk in his office. The celebrated\r\npainter, Gilbert Stuart, coming into the office one day and observing\r\nthe uncouth figure, added with his pencil a head, wings, and claws, and\r\nexclaimed, \"That will do for a salamander!\" \"Better say a Gerrymander!\"\r\ngrowled the editor; and the outlandish, name, thus duly coined, soon\r\ncame into general currency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Tyler's _Patrick Henry_, p. 313.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: _Winsor's Memorial History of Boston_, vol. iii. p. 212;\r\nsee also Bryce, _loc. cit_. The word is sometimes incorrectly pronounced\r\n\"jerrymander.\" Mr. Winsor observes that the back line of the creature's\r\nbody forms a profile caricature of Gerry's face, with the nose at\r\nMiddleton.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The election their at large.]\r\nWhen after an increase in its number of representatives the state has\r\nfailed to redistribute its districts, the additional member or members\r\nare voted for upon a general state ticket, and are called\r\n\"representatives at large.\" In Maine, where the census of 1880 had\r\n_reduced_ the number of representatives and there was some delay in the\r\nredistribution, Congress allowed the State in 1882 to elect all its\r\nrepresentatives upon a general ticket. The advantage of the district\r\nsystem is that the candidates are likely to be better known by\r\nneighbours, but the election at large is perhaps more likely to secure\r\nable men.[10] It is the American custom to nominate only residents of the\r\ndistrict as candidates for the House of Representatives. A citizen of\r\nAlbany, for example, would not be nominated for the district in which\r\nBuffalo is situated. In the British practice, on the other hand, if an\r\neminent man cannot get a nomination in his own county or borough, there\r\nis nothing to prevent his standing for any other county or borough. This\r\nsystem seems more favourable to the independence of the legislator than\r\nour system. Some of its advantages are obtained by the election at\r\nlarge.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The difference is similar to the difference between the\r\nFrench _scrutin d'arrondissement_ and _scrutin de liste_.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Time of assembling.]\r\nCongress must assemble at least once in every year, and the constitution\r\nappoints the first Monday in December for the time of meeting; but\r\nCongress can, if worth while, enact a law changing the time. The\r\nestablished custom is to hold the election for representatives upon the\r\nsame day as the election for president, the Tuesday after the first\r\nMonday in November. As the period of the new administration does not\r\nbegin until the fourth day of the following March, the new House of\r\nRepresentatives does not assemble until the December following that\r\ndate, unless the new president should at some earlier moment summon an\r\nextra session of Congress. It thus happens that ordinarily the\r\nrepresentatives of the nation do not meet for more than a year after\r\ntheir election; and as their business is at least to give legislative\r\nexpression to the popular opinion which elected them, the delay is in\r\nthis instance regarded by many persons as inconvenient and injudicious.\r\n\r\nEach house is judge of the elections, qualifications, and returns of its\r\nown members; determines its own rules of procedure, and may punish its\r\nmembers for disorderly behaviour, or by a two thirds vote expel a\r\nmember. Absent members may be compelled under penalties to attend. Each\r\nhouse is required to keep a journal of its proceedings and at proper\r\nintervals to publish it, except such parts as for reasons of public\r\npolicy had better be kept secret. At the request of one fifth of the\r\nmembers present, the yeas and nays must be entered on the journal.\r\nDuring the session of Congress neither house may, without consent of the\r\nother, adjourn for more than three days, or to any other place than that\r\nin which Congress is sitting.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Privileges of members.]\r\nSenators and representatives receive a salary fixed by law, and as they\r\nare federal functionaries they are paid from the federal treasury. In\r\nall cases, except treason or felony or breach of the peace, they are\r\nprivileged from arrest during their attendance in Congress, as also\r\nwhile on their way to it and while returning home; \"and for any speech\r\nor debate in either house they shall not be questioned in any other\r\nplace.\" These provisions are reminiscences of the evil days when the\r\nking strove to interfere, by fair means or foul, with free speech in\r\nparliament; and they are important enough to be incorporated in the\r\nsupreme law of the land. No person can at the same time hold any civil\r\noffice under the United States government and be a member of either\r\nhouse of Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Speaker.]\r\nThe vice-president is the presiding officer of the Senate, with power\r\nto vote only in case of a tie. The House of Representatives elects its\r\npresiding officer, who is called the Speaker. In the early history of\r\nthe House of Commons, its presiding officer was naturally enough its\r\n_spokesman_. He could speak for it in addressing the crown. Henry\r\nof Keighley thus addressed the crown in 1301, and there were other\r\ninstances during that century, until in 1376 the title of Speaker was\r\ndefinitely given to Sir Thomas Hungerford, and from that date the list\r\nis unbroken. The title was given to the presiding officers of the\r\nAmerican colonial assemblies, and thence it passed on to the state and\r\nfederal legislatures. The Speaker presides over the debates, puts the\r\nquestion, and decides points of order. He also appoints the committees\r\nof the House of Representatives, and as the initiatory work in our\r\nlegislation is now so largely done by the committees, this makes him\r\nthe most powerful officer of the government except the President.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Impeachment in England]\r\nThe provisions for impeachment of public officers are copied from the\r\ncustom in England. Since the fourteenth century the House of Commons\r\nhas occasionally exercised the power of impeaching the king's\r\nministers and other high public officers, and although the power was\r\nnot used during the sixteenth century it was afterward revived and\r\nconclusively established. In 1701 it was enacted that the royal pardon\r\ncould not be pleaded against an impeachment, and this act finally secured\r\nthe responsibility of the king's ministers to Parliament. An impeachment\r\nis a kind of accusation or indictment brought against a public officer\r\nby the House of Commons. The court in which the case is tried is the House\r\nof Lords, and the ordinary rules of judicial procedure are followed.\r\nThe regular president of the House of Lords is the Lord Chancellor, who\r\nis the highest judicial officer in the kingdom. A simple majority vote\r\nsecures conviction, and then it is left for the House of Commons to\r\nsay whether judgment shall be pronounced or not.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Impeachment in the United States.]\r\nIn the United States the House of Representatives has the sole\r\npower of impeachment, and the Senate has the sole power to try all\r\nimpeachments. When the president of the United States is tried,\r\nthe chief-justice must preside. As a precaution against the use of\r\nimpeachment for party purposes, a two thirds vote is required for\r\nconviction; and this precaution proved effectual (fortunately, as most\r\npersons now admit) in the famous case of President Johnson in 1868. In\r\ncase of conviction the judgment cannot extend further than \"to removal\r\nfrom office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any office of\r\nhonour, trust, or profit under the United States;\" but the person\r\nconvicted is liable afterward to be tried and punished by the ordinary\r\nprocess of law.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Veto power of the president]\r\nThe provisions of the Constitution for legislation are admirably\r\nsimple. All bills for raising revenue must originate in the lower\r\nhouse, but the upper house may propose or concur with amendments, as\r\non other bills. This provision was inherited from Parliament, through\r\nthe colonial legislatures. After a bill has passed both houses it must\r\nbe sent to the president for approval. If he approves it, he signs\r\nit; if not, he returns it to the house in which it originated, with\r\na written statement of his objections, and this statement must be\r\nentered in full upon the journal of the house. The bill is then\r\nreconsidered, and if it obtains a two thirds vote, it is sent,\r\ntogether with the objections, to the other house. If it there\r\nlikewise obtains a two thirds vote, it becomes a law, in spite of the\r\nobjections. Otherwise it fails. If the president keeps a bill longer\r\nthan ten days (Sundays excepted) without signing it, it becomes a law\r\nwithout his signature; unless Congress adjourns before the expiration\r\nof the ten days, in which case it fails to become a law, just as if\r\nit had been vetoed. This method of vetoing a bill just before the\r\nexpiration of a Congress, by keeping it in one's pocket, so to speak,\r\nwas dubbed a \"pocket veto,\" and was first employed by President\r\nJackson in 1829. The president's veto power is a qualified form of\r\nthat which formerly belonged to the English sovereign but has now, as\r\nalready observed, become practically obsolete. As a means of guarding\r\nthe country against unwise legislation, it has proved to be one of the\r\nmost valuable features of our Federal Constitution. In bad hands it\r\ncannot do much harm, it can only delay for a short time a needed law.\r\nBut when properly used it can save the country from, laws that if once\r\nenacted would sow seeds of disaster very hard to eradicate; and it has\r\nrepeatedly done so. A single man will often act intelligently where\r\na group of men act foolishly, and, as already observed, he is apt to\r\nhave a keener sense of responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\nWhat is to be said with regard to the following topics?\r\n\r\n1.

In his other capacities\r\nhe is the chief executive officer of the Federal Union; and inasmuch\r\nas he appoints the other great executive officers, he is really the\r\nhead of the executive department, not--like the governor of a state--a\r\nmere member of it. His title of \"President\" is probably an inheritance\r\nfrom the presidents of the Continental Congress. In Franklin's plan\r\nof union, in 1754, the head of the executive department was called\r\n\"Governor General,\" but that title had an unpleasant sound to American\r\nears. Our great-grandfathers liked \"president\" better, somewhat as the\r\nRomans, in the eighth century of their city, preferred \"imperator\" to\r\n\"rex.\" Then, as it served to distinguish widely between the head of\r\nthe Union and the heads of the states, it soon fell into disuse in the\r\nstate governments, and thus \"president\" has come to be a much grander\r\ntitle than \"governor,\" just as \"emperor\" has come to be a grander\r\ntitle than \"king.\" [11]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: See above p. 163.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The electoral college.]\r\nThere was no question which perplexed the Federal Convention more than\r\nthe question as to the best method of electing the president. There\r\nwas a general distrust of popular election for an office so exalted.\r\nAt one time the Convention decided to have the president elected by\r\nCongress, but there was a grave objection to this; it would be likely\r\nto destroy his independence, and make him the tool of Congress.\r\nFinally the device of an electoral college was adopted. Each state\r\nis entitled to a number of electors equal to the number of its\r\nrepresentatives in Congress, _plus_ two, the number of its\r\nsenators. Thus to-day Delaware, with 1 representative, has 3 electors;\r\nMissouri, with 14 representatives, has 16 electors; New York, with\r\n34 representatives, has 36 electors. No federal senator or\r\nrepresentative, or any person holding civil office under the United\r\nStates, can serve as an elector. Each state may appoint or choose its\r\nelectors in such manner as it sees fit; at first they were more often\r\nthan otherwise chosen by the legislatures, now they are always elected\r\nby the people. The day of election must be the same in all the states.\r\n\r\nBy an act of Congress passed in 1792 it is required to be within 34 days\r\npreceding the first Wednesday in December. A subsequent act in 1845\r\nappointed the Tuesday following the first Monday in November as election\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBy the act of 1792 the electors chosen in each state are required to\r\nassemble on the first Wednesday in December at some place in the state\r\nwhich is designated by the legislature. Before this date the governor of\r\nthe state must cause a certified list of the names of the electors to be\r\nmade out in triplicate and delivered to the electors. Having met\r\ntogether they vote for president and vice-president, make out a sealed\r\ncertificate of their vote in triplicate, and attach to each copy a copy\r\nof the certified list of their names. One copy must be delivered by a\r\nmessenger to the president of the Senate at the federal capital before\r\nthe first Wednesday in January; the second is sent to the same officer\r\nthrough the mail; the third is to be deposited with the federal judge of\r\nthe district in which the electors meet. If by the first Wednesday in\r\nJanuary the certificate has not been received at the federal capital,\r\nthe secretary of state is to send a messenger to the district judge and\r\nobtain the copy deposited with him. The interval of a month was allowed\r\nto get the returns in, for those were not the days of railroad and\r\ntelegraph. The messengers were allowed twenty-five cents a mile, and\r\nwere subject to a fine of a thousand dollars for neglect of duty. On the\r\nsecond Wednesday in February, Congress is required to be in session, and\r\nthe votes received are counted and the result declared.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See note on p. 278.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The twelfth amendment (1804).]\r\nAt first the electoral votes did not state whether the candidates named\r\nin them were candidates for the presidency or for the vice-presidency.\r\nEach elector simply wrote down two names, only one of which could be the\r\nname of a citizen of his own state. In the official count the candidate\r\nwho had the largest number of votes, provided they were a majority of\r\nthe whole number, was declared president, and the candidate who had the\r\nnext to the largest number was declared vice-president. The natural\r\nresult of this was seen in the first contested election in 1796, which\r\nmade Adams president, and his antagonist vice-president. In the next\r\nelection in 1800 it gave to Jefferson and his colleague Burr exactly the\r\nsame number of votes. In such a case the House of Representatives must\r\nelect, and such intrigues followed for the purpose of defeating\r\nJefferson that the country was brought to the verge of civil war. It\r\nthus became necessary to change the method. By the twelfth amendment to\r\nthe constitution, declared in force in 1804, the present method was\r\nadopted. The electors make separate ballots for president and for\r\nvice-president. In the official count the votes for president are first\r\ninspected. If no candidate has a majority, then the House of\r\nRepresentatives must immediately choose the president from the three\r\nnames highest on the list. In this choice the house votes by states,\r\neach state having one vote; a quorum for this purpose must consist of at\r\nleast one member from two thirds of the states, and a majority of all\r\nthe states is necessary for a choice. Then if no candidate for the\r\nvice-presidency has a majority, the Senate makes its choice from the two\r\nnames highest on the list; a quorum for the purpose consists of two\r\nthirds of the whole number of senators, and a majority of the whole\r\nnumber is necessary to a choice. Since this amendment was made there has\r\nbeen one instance of an election of the president by the House of\r\nRepresentatives,--that of John Quincy Adams in 1825; and there has been\r\none instance of an election of the vice-president by the Senate,--that\r\nof Richard Mentor Johnson in 1837.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The electoral commission (1877).]\r\nOne serious difficulty was not yet foreseen and provided for--that of\r\ndeciding between two conflicting returns sent in by two hostile sets of\r\nelectors in the same state, each list being certified by one of two\r\nrival governors claiming authority in the same state. Such a case\r\noccurred in 1877, when Florida, Louisiana, and South Carolina were the\r\nscene of struggles between rival governments. Ballots for Tilden and\r\nballots for Hayes were sent in at the same time from these states, and\r\nin the absence of any recognized means of determining which ballots to\r\ncount, the two parties in Congress submitted the result to arbitration.\r\nAn \"electoral commission\" was created for the occasion, composed of five\r\nsenators, five representatives, and five judges of the supreme court;\r\nand this body decided what votes were to be counted. It was a clumsy\r\nexpedient, but infinitely preferable to civil war. The question of\r\nconflicting returns has at length been set at rest by the act of 1887,\r\nwhich provides that no electoral votes can be rejected in counting\r\nexcept by the concurrent action of the two houses of Congress.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Presidential succession.]\r\nThe devolution of the presidential office in case of the president's\r\ndeath has also been made the subject of legislative change and\r\namendment. The office of vice-president was created chiefly for the\r\npurpose of meeting such an emergency. Upon the accession of the\r\nvice-president to the presidency, the Senate would proceed to elect its\r\nown president _pro tempore_. An act of 1791 provided that in case of the\r\ndeath, resignation or disability of both president and vice-president,\r\nthe succession should devolve first upon the president _pro tempore_ of\r\nthe Senate and then upon the speaker of the House of Representatives,\r\nuntil the disability should be removed or a new election be held. But\r\nsupposing a newly elected president to die and be succeeded by the\r\nvice-president before the assembling of the newly elected Congress; then\r\nthere would be no president _pro tempore_ of the Senate and no speaker\r\nof the House of Representatives, and thus the death of one person might\r\ncause the presidency to lapse. Moreover the presiding officers of the\r\ntwo houses of Congress might be members of the party defeated in the\r\nlast presidential election; indeed, this is often the case. Sound policy\r\nand fair dealing require that a victorious party shall not be turned out\r\nbecause of the death of the president and vice-president. Accordingly an\r\nact of 1886 provided that in such an event the succession should devolve\r\nupon the members of the cabinet in the following order: secretary of\r\nstate, secretary of the treasury, secretary of war, attorney-general,\r\npostmaster-general, secretary of the navy, secretary of the interior.\r\nThis would seem to be ample provision against a lapse.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Original purpose of the electoral college not fulfilled.]\r\nTo return to the electoral college: it was devised as a safeguard\r\nagainst popular excitement. It was supposed that the electors in their\r\nDecember meeting would calmly discuss the merits of the ablest men in\r\nthe country and make an intelligent selection for the presidency. The\r\nelectors were to use their own judgment, and it was not necessary\r\nthat all the electors chosen in one state should vote for the same\r\ncandidate. The people on election day were not supposed to be voting\r\nfor a president but for presidential electors. This theory was never\r\nrealized. The two elections of Washington, in 1788 and 1792, were\r\nunanimous. In the second contested election, that of 1800, the\r\nelectors simply registered the result of the popular vote, and it has\r\nbeen so ever since. Immediately after the popular election, a whole\r\nmonth before the meeting of the electoral college, we know who is to\r\nbe the next president. There is no law to prevent an elector from\r\nvoting for a different pair of candidates from those at the head of\r\nthe party ticket, but the custom has become as binding as a statute.\r\nThe elector is chosen to vote for specified candidates, and he must do\r\nso.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Electors formerly chosen in many states by districts; now\r\nusually on a general ticket.]\r\nOn the other hand, it was not until long after 1800 that all the\r\nelectoral votes of the same state were necessarily given to the same\r\npair of candidates. It was customary in many states to choose the\r\nelectors by districts. A state entitled to ten electors would choose\r\neight of them in its eight congressional districts, and there were\r\nvarious ways of choosing the other two. In some of the districts one\r\nparty would have a majority, in others the other, and so the electoral\r\nvote of the state would be divided between two pairs of candidates.\r\nAfter 1830 it became customary to choose the electors upon a general\r\nticket, and thus the electoral vote became solid in each state.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: In 1860 the vote of New Jersey was divided between Lincoln\r\nand Douglas, but that was because the names of three of\r\nthe seven Douglas electors were upon two different tickets, and\r\nthus got a majority of votes while the other four fell short. In\r\n1892 the state of Michigan chose its electors by districts.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Minority presidents.]\r\n[Sidenote: Advantages of the electoral system.]\r\nThis system, of course, increases the chances of electing presidents who\r\nhave received a minority of the popular vote. A candidate may carry one\r\nstate by an immense majority and thus gain 6 or 8 electoral votes; he\r\nmay come within a few hundred of carrying another state and thus lose 36\r\nelectoral votes. Or a small third party may divert some thousands of\r\nvotes from the principal candidate without affecting the electoral vote\r\nof the state. Since Washington's second term we have had twenty-three\r\ncontested elections,[14] and in nine of these the elected president has\r\nfailed to receive a majority of the popular vote; Adams in 1824 (elected\r\nby the House of Representatives), Polk in 1844, Taylor in 1848, Buchanan\r\nin 1856, Lincoln in 1860, Hayes in 1876, Garfield in 1880, Cleveland in\r\n1884, Harrison in 1888. This has suggested more or less vague\r\nspeculation as to the advisableness of changing the method of electing\r\nthe president. It has been suggested that it would be well to abolish\r\nthe electoral college, and resort to a direct popular vote, without\r\nreference to state lines. Such a method would be open to one serious\r\nobjection. In a closely contested election on the present method the\r\nresult may remain doubtful for three or four days, while a narrow\r\nmajority of a few hundred votes in some great state is being ascertained\r\nby careful counting. It was so in 1884. This period of doubt is sure to\r\nbe a period of intense and dangerous excitement. In an election without\r\nreference to states, the result would more often be doubtful, and it\r\nwould be sometimes necessary to count every vote in every little\r\nout-of-the-way corner of the country before the question could be\r\nsettled. The occasions for dispute would be multiplied a hundred fold,\r\nwith most demoralizing effect. Our present method is doubtless clumsy,\r\nbut the solidity of the electoral colleges is a safeguard, and as all\r\nparties understand the system it is in the long run as fair for one as\r\nfor another.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: All have been contested, except Monroe's re-election in\r\n1820, when there was no opposing candidate.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nomination of candidates by congressional caucus\r\n(1800-24).]\r\nThe Constitution says nothing about the method of nominating candidates\r\nfor the presidency, neither has it been made the subject of legislation.\r\nIt has been determined by convenience. It was not necessary to nominate\r\nWashington, and the candidacies of Adams and Jefferson were also matters\r\nof general understanding. In 1800 the Republican and Federalist members\r\nof Congress respectively held secret meetings or caucuses, chiefly for\r\nthe purpose of agreeing upon candidates for the vice-presidency and\r\nmaking some plans for the canvass. It became customary to nominate\r\ncandidates in such congressional caucuses, but there was much hostile\r\ncomment upon the system as undemocratic. Sometimes the \"favourite son\"\r\nof a state was nominated by the legislature, but as the means of travel\r\nimproved, the nominating convention came to be preferred. In 1824 there\r\nwere four candidates for the presidency,--Adams, Jackson, Clay, and\r\nCrawford. Adams was nominated by the legislatures of most of the New\r\nEngland states; Clay by the legislature of Kentucky, followed by the\r\nlegislatures of Missouri, Ohio, Illinois, and Louisiana; Crawford by the\r\nlegislature of Virginia; and Jackson by a mass convention of the people\r\nof Blount County in Tennessee, followed by local conventions in many\r\nother states. The congressional caucus met and nominated Crawford, but\r\nthis endorsement did not help him,[15] and this method was no longer\r\ntried. In 1832 for the first time the candidates were all nominated in\r\nnational conventions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Stanwood, _History of Presidential Elections_, pp.\r\n80-83.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Nomination conventions.]\r\n[Sidenote: The \"primary.\"]\r\nThese conventions, as fully developed, are representative bodies\r\nchosen for the specific purpose of nominating candidates and making\r\nthose declarations of principle and policy known as \"platforms.\" Each\r\nstate is allowed twice as many delegates as it has electoral votes.\r\nThe delegates are chosen by local conventions in their several\r\nstates, viz., two for each congressional district by the party\r\nconvention of that district, and four for the whole state (called\r\ndelegates-at-large) by the state convention. As each convention is\r\ncomposed of delegates from primaries, it is the composition of the\r\nprimaries which determines that of the local conventions, and it is\r\nthe composition of the local conventions which determines that of the\r\nnational.[16] The \"primary\" is the smallest nominating convention. It\r\nstands in somewhat the same relation to the national convention as the\r\nrelation of a township or ward to the whole United States. A primary\r\nis a little caucus of all the voters of one party who live within the\r\nbounds of the township or ward. It differs in composition from the\r\ntown-meeting in that all its members belong to one party. It has two\r\nduties: one is to nominate candidates for the local offices of the\r\ntownship or ward; the other is to choose delegates to the county or\r\ndistrict convention. The primary, as its name indicates, is a primary\r\nand not a representative assembly. The party voters in a township or\r\nward are usually not too numerous to meet together, and all ought to\r\nattend such meetings, though in practice too many people stay away. By\r\nthe representative system, through various grades of convention, the\r\nwishes and character of these countless little primaries are at\r\nlength expressed in the wishes and character of the national party\r\nconvention, and candidates for the presidency and vice-presidency are\r\nnominated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Bryce, _American Commonwealth_, vol. ii. p. 145; see\r\nalso p. 52.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Qualifications for the presidency.]\r\nThe qualifications for the two offices are of course the same.\r\nForeign-born citizens are not eligible, though this restriction did\r\nnot include such as were citizens of the United States at the time\r\nwhen the Constitution was adopted. The candidate must have reached the\r\nage of thirty-five, and must have been fourteen years a resident of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The term of office]\r\nThe president's term of office is four years. The Constitution says\r\nnothing about his re-election, and there is no written law to prevent\r\nhis being re-elected a dozen times. But Washington, after serving two\r\nterms, refused to accept the office a third time. Jefferson in 1808\r\nwas \"earnestly besought by many and influential bodies of citizens to\r\nbecome a candidate for a third term;\" [17] and had he consented there\r\nis scarcely a doubt that he would have been elected. His refusal\r\nestablished a custom which has never been infringed, though there were\r\npersons in 1876 and again in 1880 who wished to secure a third term\r\nfor Grant.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Morse's _Jefferson_, p. 318.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers and duties of the President]\r\nThe president is commander-in-chief of the military and naval forces\r\nof the United States, and of the militia of the several states when\r\nactually engaged in the service of the United States; and he has the\r\nroyal prerogative of granting reprieves and pardons for offences\r\nagainst the United States, except in cases of impeachment.[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: See above, p. 221.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHe can make treaties with foreign powers, but they must be confirmed\r\nby a two thirds vote of the Senate. He appoints ministers to foreign\r\ncountries, consuls, and the greater federal officers, such as the\r\nheads of executive departments and judges of the Supreme Court, and\r\nall these appointments are subject to confirmation by the Senate. He\r\nalso appoints a vast number of inferior officers, such as postmasters\r\nand revenue collectors, without the participation of the Senate. When\r\nvacancies occur during the recess of the Senate, he may fill them by\r\ngranting commissions to expire at the end of the next session. He\r\ncommissions all federal officers. He receives foreign ministers. He\r\nmay summon either or both houses of Congress to an extra session, and\r\nif the two houses disagree with regard to the time of adjournment, he\r\nmay adjourn them to such time as he thinks best, but of course not\r\nbeyond the day fixed for the beginning of the next regular session.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The President's message.]\r\nThe president must from time to time make a report to Congress on the\r\nstate of affairs in the country and suggest such a line of policy or\r\nsuch special measures as may seem good to him. This report has taken\r\nthe form of an annual written message. Washington and Adams began\r\ntheir administrations by addressing Congress in a speech, to which\r\nCongress replied; but it suited the opposite party to discover in this\r\nan imitation of the British practice of opening Parliament with\r\na speech from the sovereign. It was accordingly stigmatized as\r\n\"monarchical,\" and Jefferson (though without formally alleging any\r\nsuch reason) set the example, which has been followed ever since,\r\nof addressing Congress in a written message.[19] Besides this annual\r\nmessage, the president may at any time send in a special message\r\nrelating to matters which in his opinion require immediate attention.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Jefferson, moreover, was a powerful writer and a poor\r\nspeaker.]\r\n\r\nThe effectiveness of a president's message depends of course on the\r\ncharacter of the president and the general features of the political\r\nsituation. That separation between the executive and legislative\r\ndepartments, which is one of the most distinctive features of civil\r\ngovernment in the United States, tends to prevent the development of\r\nleadership. An English prime minister's policy, so long as he remains\r\nin office, must be that of the House of Commons; power and responsibility\r\nare concentrated. An able president may virtually direct the policy of\r\nhis party in Congress, but he often has a majority against him in one\r\nhouse and sometimes in both at once. Thus in dividing power we divide\r\nand weaken responsibility. To this point I have already alluded as\r\nillustrated in our state governments.[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The English method, however, would probably not work\r\nwell in this country, and might prove to be a source of great and\r\ncomplicated dangers. See above, p. 169.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Executive departments]\r\n[Sidenote: The cabinet]\r\nThe Constitution made no specific provisions for the creation of\r\nexecutive departments, but left the matter to Congress. At the\r\nbeginning of Washington's administration three secretaryships were\r\ncreated,--those of state, treasury, and war; and an attorney-general\r\nwas appointed. Afterward the department of the navy was separated\r\nfrom that of war, the postmaster-general was made a member of the\r\nadministration, and as lately as 1849 the department of the interior\r\nwas organized. The heads of these departments are the president's\r\nadvisers, but they have as a body no recognized legal existence or\r\nauthority. They hold their meetings in a room at the president's\r\nexecutive mansion, the White House, but no record is kept of their\r\nproceedings and the president is not bound to heed their advice. This\r\nbody has always been called the \"Cabinet,\" after the English usage. It\r\nis like the English cabinet in being composed of heads of executive\r\ndepartments and in being, as a body, unknown to the law; in other\r\nrespects the difference is very great. The English cabinet is the\r\nexecutive committee of the House of Commons, and exercises a guiding\r\nand directing influence upon legislation. The position of the president is\r\nnot at all like that of the prime minister; it is more like that of\r\nthe English sovereign, though the latter has not nearly so much power\r\nas the president; and the American cabinet in some respects resembles\r\nthe English privy council, though it cannot make ordinances.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The secretary of state.]\r\nThe secretary of state ranks first among our cabinet officers. He is\r\noften called our prime minister or \"premier,\" but there could not be\r\na more absurd use of language. In order to make an American personage\r\ncorresponding to the English prime minister we must first go to the\r\nHouse of Representatives, take its committee of ways and means and\r\nits committee on appropriations, and unite them into one committee of\r\nfinance; then we must take the chairman of this committee, give him\r\nthe power of dissolving the House and ordering a new election, and\r\nmake him master of all the executive departments, while at the\r\nsame time we strip from the president all real control over the\r\nadministration. This exalted finance-chairman would be much like the\r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury, commonly called the prime minister. This\r\nillustration shows how wide the divergence has become between our\r\nsystem and that of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nOur secretary of state is our minister of foreign affairs, and is the\r\nonly officer who is authorized to communicate with other governments in\r\nthe name of the president. He is at the head of the diplomatic and\r\nconsular service, issuing the instructions to our ministers abroad, and\r\nhe takes a leading part in the negotiation of treaties. To these\r\nministerial duties he adds some that are more characteristic of his\r\ntitle of secretary. He keeps the national archives, and superintends the\r\npublication of laws, treaties, and proclamations; and he is the keeper\r\nof the great seal of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Diplomatic and consular service.]\r\nOur foreign relations are cared for in foreign countries by two distinct\r\nclasses of officials: ministers and consuls. The former represent the\r\nUnited States government in a diplomatic capacity; the latter have\r\nnothing to do with diplomacy or politics, but look after our commercial\r\ninterests in foreign countries. Consuls exercise a protective care over\r\nseamen, and perform various duties for Americans abroad. They can take\r\ntestimony and administer estates. In some non-Christian countries, such\r\nas China, Japan, and Turkey, they have jurisdiction over criminal cases\r\nin which Americans are concerned. Formerly our ministers abroad were of\r\nonly three grades: (1) \"envoys extraordinary and ministers\r\nplenipotentiary;\" (2) \"ministers resident;\" (3) _chargés d'affaires_.\r\nThe first two are accredited by the president to the head of government\r\nof the countries to which they are sent; the third are accredited by the\r\nsecretary of state to the minister of foreign affairs in the countries\r\nto which they are sent. We still retain these grades, which correspond\r\nto the lower grades of the diplomatic service in European countries.\r\nUntil lately we had no highest grade answering to that of \"ambassador,\"\r\nperhaps because when our diplomatic service was organized the United\r\nStates did not yet rank among first-rate powers, and could not expect to\r\nreceive ambassadors. Great powers, like France and Germany, send\r\nambassadors to each other, and envoys to inferior powers, like Denmark\r\nor Greece or Guatemala. When we send envoys to the great powers, we rank\r\nourselves along with inferior powers; and diplomatic etiquette as a rule\r\nobliges the great powers to send to us the same grade of minister that\r\nwe send to them. There were found to be some practical inconveniences\r\nabout this, so that in 1892 the highest grade was adopted and our\r\nministers to Great Britain and France were made ambassadors.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The secretary of the treasury.]\r\nThe cabinet officer second in rank and in some respects first in\r\nimportance is the secretary of the treasury. He conducts the financial\r\nbusiness of the government, superintends the collection of revenue,\r\nand gives warrants for the payment of moneys from the treasury. He\r\nalso superintends the coinage, the national banks, the custom-houses,\r\nthe coast-survey and lighthouse system, the marine hospitals, and\r\nlife-saving service.[21] He sends reports to Congress, and suggests\r\nsuch measures as seem good to him. Since the Civil War his most\r\nweighty business has been the management of the national debt. He\r\nis aided by two assistant secretaries, six auditors, a register, a\r\ncomptroller, a solicitor, a director of the mint, commissioner of\r\ninternal revenue, chiefs of the bureau of statistics and bureau of\r\nengraving and printing, etc. The business of the treasury department\r\nis enormous, and no part of our government has been more faithfully\r\nadministered. Since 1789 the treasury has disbursed more than seven\r\nbillions of dollars without one serious defalcation. No man directly\r\ninterested in trade or commerce can be appointed secretary of the\r\ntreasury, and the department has almost always been managed by \"men of\r\nsmall incomes bred either to politics or the legal profession.\" [22]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Many of these details concerning the executive\r\ndepartments are admirably summarized, and with more fullness\r\nthan comports with the design of the present work, in Thorpe's\r\n_Government of the People of the United States_, pp. 183-193.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: Schouler, _Hist. of the U.S._, vol. i. p. 95.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: War and navy.]\r\nThe war and navy departments need no special description here. The\r\nformer is divided into ten and the latter into eight bureaus.\r\nThe naval department, among many duties, has charge of the naval\r\nobservatory at Washington and publishes the nautical almanac.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Interior.]\r\nThe department of the interior conducts a vast and various business,\r\nas is shown by the designations of its eight bureaus, which deal with\r\npublic lands, Indian affairs, pensions, patents, education (chiefly in\r\nthe way of gathering statistics and reporting upon school affairs),\r\nagriculture, public documents, and the census. In 1889 the bureau of\r\nagriculture was organized as a separate department. The weather bureau\r\nforms a branch of the department of agriculture.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Postmaster-general and attorney-general.]\r\nThe departments of the postmaster-general and attorney-general need\r\nno special description. The latter was organized in 1870 into the\r\ndepartment of justice. The attorney-general is the president's legal\r\nadviser, and represents the United States in all law-suits to which\r\nthe United States is a party. He is aided by a solicitor-general and\r\nother subordinate offices.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

Observe how wisely the\r\nConstitution confines itself to a clear sketch of fundamentals, and\r\nleaves as much as possible to be developed by circumstances. In this\r\nfeature lies partly the flexible strength, the adaptableness, of our\r\nFederal Constitution. That strength lies partly also in the excellent\r\npartition of powers between the federal government and the several\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Difference between confederation and federal union.]\r\nWe have already remarked upon the vastness of the functions retained\r\nby the states. At the same time the powers granted to Congress have\r\nproved sufficient to bind the states together into a union that is\r\nmore than a mere confederation. From 1776 to 1789 the United States\r\n_were_ a confederation; after 1789 it was a federal nation. The\r\npassage from plural to singular was accomplished, although it took\r\nsome people a good while to realize the fact. The German language\r\nhas a neat way of distinguishing between a loose confederation and a\r\nfederal union. It calls the former a _Staatenbund_ and the latter\r\na _Bundesstaat_. So in English, if we liked, we might call the\r\nconfederation a _Band-of-States_ and the federal union a _Banded-State_.\r\nThere are two points especially in our Constitution which transformed\r\nour country from a Band-of-States into a Banded-State.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers granted to Congress.]\r\nThe first was the creation of a federal House of Representatives, thus\r\nsecuring for Congress the power to lay and collect taxes, duties,\r\nimposts, and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common\r\nwelfare of the United States. Other powers are naturally attached to\r\nthis,--such as the power to borrow money on the credit of the United\r\nStates; to regulate foreign and domestic commerce; to coin money\r\nand fix the standard of weights and measures; to provide for\r\nthe punishment of counterfeiters; to establish post-offices and\r\npost-roads; to issue copyrights and patents; to define and punish\r\nfelonies committed on the high seas, and offences against the law of\r\nnations; to declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and\r\nmake rules concerning captures on land and water; to raise and\r\nsupport an army and navy, and to make rules for the regulation of\r\nthe land and naval forces; to provide for calling out the militia\r\nto suppress insurrections and repel invasions, and to command this\r\nmilitia while actually employed in the service of the United States.\r\nThe several states, however, train their own militia and appoint\r\nthe officers. Congress may also establish a uniform rule of\r\nnaturalization, and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies. It\r\nalso exercises exclusive control over the District of Columbia,[23]\r\nas the seat of the national government, and over forts, magazines,\r\narsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings, which it erects\r\nwithin the several states upon land purchased for such purposes with\r\nthe consent of the state legislature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Ceded to the United States by Maryland and Virginia.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The \"Elastic Clause.\"]\r\nCongress is also empowered \"to make all laws which shall be necessary\r\nand proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all\r\nother powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the\r\nUnited States, or in any department or office thereof.\" This may be\r\ncalled the Elastic Clause of the Constitution; it has undergone a\r\ngood deal of stretching for one purpose and another, and, as we shall\r\npresently see, it was a profound disagreement in the interpretation of\r\nthis clause that after 1789 divided the American people into two great\r\npolitical parties.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers denied to the states.]\r\n[Sidenote: Paper currency.]\r\nThe national authority of Congress is further sharply defined by the\r\nexpress denial of sundry powers to the several states. These we have\r\nalready enumerated.[24] There was an especial reason for prohibiting\r\nthe states from issuing bills of credit, or making anything but gold\r\nand silver coin a tender in payment of debts. During the years 1785\r\nand 1786 a paper money craze ran through the country; most of the\r\nstates issued paper notes, and passed laws obliging their citizens to\r\nreceive them in payment of debts. Now a paper dollar is not money, it\r\nis only the government's promise to pay a dollar. As long as you can\r\nsend it to the treasury and get a gold dollar in exchange, it is worth\r\na dollar. It is this exchangeableness that makes it worth a dollar.\r\nWhen government makes the paper dollar note a \"legal tender.\" i.e.,\r\nwhen it refuses to give you the gold dollar and makes you take its\r\nnote instead, the note soon ceases to be worth a dollar. You would\r\nrather have the gold than the note, for the mere fact that government\r\nrefuses to give the gold shows that it is in financial difficulties.\r\nSo the note's value is sure to fall, and if the government is in\r\nserious difficulty, it falls very far, and as it falls it takes more\r\nof it to buy things. Prices go up. There was a time (1864) during our\r\nCivil War when a paper dollar was worth only forty cents and a barrel\r\nof flour cost $23. But that was nothing to the year 1780, when the\r\npaper dollar issued by the Continental Congress was worth only a mill,\r\nand flour was sold in Boston for $1,575 a barrel! When the different\r\nstates tried to make paper money, it made confusion worse confounded,\r\nfor the states refused to take each other's money, and this helped to\r\nlower its value. In some states the value of the paper dollar fell in\r\nless than a year to twelve or fifteen cents. At such times there is\r\nalways great demoralization and suffering, especially among the poorer\r\npeople; and with all the experience of the past to teach us, it may\r\nnow be held to be little less than a criminal act for a government,\r\nunder any circumstances, to make its paper notes a legal tender. The\r\nexcuse for the Continental Congress was that it was not completely a\r\ngovernment and seemed to have no alternative, but there is no doubt\r\nthat the paper currency damaged the country much more than the arms of\r\nthe enemy by land or sea. The feeling was so strong about it in the\r\nFederal Convention that the prohibition came near being extended to\r\nthe national government, but the question was unfortunately left\r\nundecided.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: See above, p.175]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: See my _Critical Period of American History_, pp.\r\n168-186, 273-276.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Powers denied to Congress.]\r\n[Sidenote: Bills of attainder.]\r\nSome express prohibitions were laid upon the national government. Duties\r\nmay be laid upon imports but not upon exports; this wise restriction was\r\na special concession to South. Carolina, which feared the effect of an\r\nexport duty upon rice and indigo. Duties and excises must be uniform\r\nthroughout the country, and no commercial preference can be shown to one\r\nstate over another; absolute free trade is the rule between the states.\r\nA census must be taken every ten years in order to adjust the\r\nrepresentation, and no direct tax can be imposed except according to the\r\ncensus. No money can be drawn from the treasury except \"in consequence\r\nof appropriations made by law,\" and accounts must be regularly kept and\r\npublished. The privilege of the writ of _habeas corpus_ cannot be\r\nsuspended except \"when, in case of rebellion or invasion, the public\r\nsafety may require it;\" and \"no bill of attainder, or _ex post facto_\r\nlaw,\" can be passed. A bill of attainder is a special legislative act by\r\nwhich a person may be condemned to death, or to outlawry and banishment,\r\nwithout the opportunity of defending himself which he would have in a\r\ncourt of law. \"No evidence is necessarily adduced to support it,\" [26] and\r\nin former times, especially in the reign of Henry VIII., it was a\r\nformidable engine for perpetrating judicial murders. Bills of attainder\r\nlong ago ceased to be employed in England, and the process was abolished\r\nby statute in 1870.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: Taswell-Langmead, _English Constitutional History_,\r\np. 385.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Intercitizenship.]\r\nNo title of nobility can be granted by the United States, and no federal\r\nofficer can accept a present, office, or title from a foreign state\r\nwithout the consent of Congress. \"No religious test shall ever be\r\nrequired as a qualification to any office or public trust under the\r\nUnited States.\" Full faith and credit must be given in each state to the\r\npublic acts and records, and to the judicial proceedings of every other\r\nstate; and it is left for Congress to determine the manner in which such\r\nacts and proceedings shall be proved or certified. The citizens of each\r\nstate are \"entitled to all privileges and immunities of citizens in the\r\nseveral states.\" There is mutual extradition of criminals, and, as a\r\nconcession to the southern states it was provided that fugitive slaves\r\nshould be surrendered to their masters. The United States guarantees to\r\nevery state a republican form of government, it protects each state\r\nagainst invasion; and on application from the legislature of a state, or\r\nfrom the executive when the legislature cannot be convened, it lends a\r\nhand in suppressing insurrection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Mode of making amendments.]\r\nAmendments to the Constitution may at any time be proposed in\r\npursuance of a two thirds vote in both houses of Congress, or by a\r\nconvention called at the request of the legislatures of two thirds of\r\nthe states. The amendments are not in force until ratified by three-fourths\r\nof the states, either through their legislatures or through\r\nspecial conventions, according to the preference of Congress. This\r\nmakes it difficult to change the Constitution, as it ought to be; but\r\nit leaves it possible to introduce changes that are very obviously\r\ndesirable. The Articles of Confederation could not be amended except\r\nby a unanimous vote of the states; and this made their amendment\r\nalmost impossible.\r\n\r\nAfter assuming all debts contracted and engagements made by the United\r\nStates before its adoption, the Constitution goes on to declare itself\r\nthe supreme law of the land. By it, and by the laws and treaties made\r\nunder it, the judges in every state are bound, in spite of anything\r\ncontrary in the constitution or laws of any state.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

What is meant by the Constitution's declaring itself the\r\nsupreme law of the land?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5. _The Federal Judiciary_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Need for a federal judiciary.]\r\nThe creation of a federal judiciary was the second principal feature in\r\nthe Constitution, which transformed our country from a loose\r\nconfederation into a federal nation, from a _Band-of-States_ into a\r\n_Banded-State_. We have seen that the American people were already\r\nsomewhat familiar with the method of testing the constitutionality of a\r\nlaw by getting the matter brought before the courts.[27] In the case of\r\na conflict between state law and federal law, the only practicable\r\npeaceful solution is that which is reached through a judicial decision.\r\nThe federal authority also needs the machinery of courts in order to\r\nenforce its own decrees.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: See above p. 194.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Federal courts and judges.]\r\n[Sidenote: District attorneys and marshals.]\r\nThe federal judiciary consists of a supreme court, circuit courts, and\r\ndistrict courts.[28] At present the supreme court consists of a chief\r\njustice and eight associate justices. It holds annual sessions in the\r\ncity of Washington, beginning on the second Monday of October. Each of\r\nthese nine judges is also presiding judge of a circuit court. The area\r\nof the United States, not including the territories, is divided into\r\nnine circuits, and in each circuit the presiding judge is assisted\r\nby special circuit judges. The circuits are divided into districts,\r\nfifty-six in all, and in each of these there is a special district\r\njudge. The districts never cross state lines. Sometimes a\r\nstate is one district, but populous states with much business are\r\ndivided into two or even three districts. \"The circuit courts sit\r\nin the several districts of each circuit successively, and the law\r\nrequires that each justice of the supreme court shall sit in each\r\ndistrict of his circuit at least once every two years.\" [29] District\r\njudges are not confined to their own districts; they may upon occasion\r\nexchange districts as ministers exchange pulpits. A district judge\r\nmay, if need be, act as a circuit judge, as a major may command a\r\nregiment. All federal judges are appointed by the president, with the\r\nconsent of the Senate, to serve during good behaviour. Each district\r\nhas its _district attorney_, whose business is to prosecute\r\noffenders against the federal laws and to conduct civil cases in\r\nwhich the national government is either plaintiff or defendant. Each\r\ndistrict has also its marshal, who has the same functions under the\r\nfederal court as the sheriff under the state court. The procedure of\r\nthe federal court usually follows that of the courts of the state in\r\nwhich it is sitting.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: See the second note on p.278.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: See Wilson, _The State_, p. 554. I have closely\r\nfollowed, though, with much abridgment, the excellent description of\r\nour federal judiciary, pp. 555-561.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The federal jurisdiction.]\r\nThe federal jurisdiction covers two classes of cases: (1) those\r\nwhich come before it \"_because of the nature of the questions\r\ninvolved_: for instance, admiralty and maritime cases, navigable\r\nwaters being within the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal\r\nauthorities, and cases arising out of the Constitution, laws, or\r\ntreaties of the United States or out of conflicting grants made by\r\ndifferent states\"; (2) those which come before it \"_because of the\r\nnature of the parties to the suit_,\" such as cases affecting the\r\nministers of foreign powers or suits between citizens of different\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe division of jurisdiction between the upper and lower federal\r\ncourts is determined chiefly by the size and importance of the cases.\r\nIn cases where a state or a foreign minister is a party the supreme\r\ncourt has original jurisdiction, in other cases it has appellate\r\njurisdiction, and \"any case which involves the interpretation of the\r\nConstitution can be taken to the supreme court, however small the sum\r\nin dispute.\" If a law of any state or of the United States is decided\r\nby the supreme court to be in violation of the Constitution, it\r\ninstantly becomes void and of no effect. In this supreme exercise\r\nof jurisdiction, our highest federal tribunal is unlike any other\r\ntribunal known to history. The supreme court is the most original of\r\nall American institutions. It is peculiarly American, and for its\r\nexalted character and priceless services it is an institution of which\r\nAmericans may well be proud.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1. What was the second important factor in transforming our country\r\nfrom a Band-of-States to a Banded-State?\r\n\r\n2. Why was a federal judiciary deemed necessary?\r\n\r\n3. The organization of the federal judiciary:--\r\n  a. The supreme court and its sessions.\r\n  b. The circuit courts.\r\n  c. The district courts.\r\n  d. Exchanges of service.\r\n  e.

Wherein the supreme court is the most original of American\r\n     institutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6. _Territorial Government._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Northwest Territory.]\r\n[Sidenote: The Ordinance of 1787.]\r\nThe Constitution provided for the admission of new states to the\r\nUnion, but it does not allow a state to be formed within another\r\nstate. A state cannot \"be formed by the junction of two or more\r\nstates, or parts of states, without the consent of the legislatures of\r\nthe states concerned as well as of the Congress.\" Shortly before the\r\nmaking of the Constitution, the United States had been endowed for the\r\nfirst time with a public domain. The territory northwest of the Ohio\r\nRiver had been claimed, on the strength of old grants and charters, by\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, New York, and Virginia. In 1777 Maryland\r\nrefused to sign the Articles of Confederation until these states\r\nshould agree to cede their claims to the United States, and thus in\r\n1784 the federal government came into possession of a magnificent\r\nterritory, out of which five great states--Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,\r\nMichigan, and Wisconsin--have since been made. While the Federal\r\nConvention was sitting at Philadelphia, the Continental Congress at\r\nNew York was doing almost its last and one of its greatest pieces\r\nof work in framing the Ordinance of 1787 for the organization and\r\ngovernment of this newly acquired territory. The ordinance created a\r\nterritorial government with governor and two-chambered legislature,\r\ncourts, magistrates, and militia. Complete civil and religious liberty\r\nwas guaranteed, negro slavery was prohibited, and provision was made\r\nfor free schools.[30]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: The manner in which provision should be made for these\r\nschools had been pointed out two years before in the land-ordinance of\r\n1785, as heretofore explained. See above, p. 86.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Other territories and their government.]\r\nIn 1803 the enormous territory known as Louisiana, comprising\r\neverything (except Texas) between the Mississippi River and the crest\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, was purchased from France. A claim upon the\r\nOregon territory was soon afterward made by discovery and exploration,\r\nand finally settled in 1846 by treaty with Great Britain. In 1848 by\r\nconquest and in 1853 by purchase the remaining Pacific lands were\r\nacquired from Mexico. All of this vast region has been at some time\r\nunder territorial government. As for Texas, on the other hand, it\r\nhas never been a territory. Texas revolted from Mexico in 1836 and\r\nremained an independent state until 1845, when it was admitted to\r\nthe Union. Territorial government has generally passed through three\r\nstages: first, there are governors and judges appointed by the\r\npresident; then as population increases, there is added a legislature\r\nchosen by the people and empowered to make laws subject to\r\nconfirmation by Congress; finally, entire legislative independence is\r\ngranted. The territory is then ripe for admission to the Union as a\r\nstate.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1. What is the constitutional provision for admitting new states?\r\n\r\n2. What states claimed the territory northwest of the Ohio river? On\r\nwhat did they base their claims?\r\n\r\n3. Why was this territory ceded to the general government?\r\n\r\n4.

How much of the public domain has been at some time under\r\nterritorial government?\r\n\r\n12. Through what three stages has territorial government usually\r\npassed?\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 7. _Ratification and Amendments._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Concessions to the South.]\r\nThus the work of the Ordinance of 1787 was in a certain sense\r\nsupplementary to the work of framing the Constitution. When the latter\r\ninstrument was completed, it was provided that \"the ratifications\r\nof the conventions of nine states shall be sufficient for the\r\nestablishment of this Constitution between the states so ratifying the\r\nsame.\" The Constitution was then laid before the Continental Congress,\r\nwhich submitted it to the states. In one state after another,\r\nconventions were held, and at length the Constitution was ratified.\r\nThere was much opposition to it, because it seemed to create a strange\r\nand untried form of government which might develop into a\r\ntyranny. There was a fear that the federal power might crush out\r\nself-government in the states. This dread was felt in all parts of the\r\ncountry. Besides this, there was some sectional opposition between\r\nNorth and South, and in Virginia there was a party in favour of a\r\nseparate southern confederacy. But South Carolina and Georgia were won\r\nover by the concessions in the Constitution to slavery, and especially\r\na provision that the importation of slaves from Africa should not\r\nbe prohibited until 1808. By winning South Carolina and Georgia the\r\nformation of a \"solid South\" was prevented.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bill of Rights proposed.]\r\nThe first states to adopt the Constitution were Delaware,\r\nPennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, and Connecticut, with slight\r\nopposition, except in Pennsylvania. Next came Massachusetts, where the\r\nconvention was very large, the discussion very long, and the action\r\nin one sense critical. One chief source of dissatisfaction was the\r\nabsence of a sufficiently explicit Bill of Rights, and to meet this\r\ndifficulty, Massachusetts ratified the Constitution, but proposed\r\namendments, and this course was followed by other states. Maryland and\r\nSouth Carolina came next, and New Hampshire made the ninth. Virginia\r\nand New York then ratified by very narrow majorities and after\r\nprolonged discussion. North Carolina did not come in until 1789, and\r\nRhode Island not until 1790.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first ten amendments.]\r\n\r\nIn September, 1789, the first ten amendments were proposed by\r\nCongress, and in December, 1791, they were declared in force. Their\r\nprovisions are similar to those of the English Bill of Rights, enacted\r\nin 1689,[31] but are much more full and explicit. They provide for\r\nfreedom of speech and of the press, the free exercise of religion, the\r\nright of the people to assemble and petition Congress for a redress\r\nof grievances, their right to bear arms, and to be secure against\r\nunreasonable searches and seizures. The quartering of soldiers is\r\nguarded, general search-warrants are prohibited, jury trial is\r\nguaranteed, and the taking of private property for public use without\r\ndue compensation, as well as excessive fines and bail and the\r\ninfliction of \"cruel and unusual punishment\" are forbidden. Congress\r\nis prohibited from establishing any form of religion.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: See above, p. 190. This is further elucidated in\r\nAppendixes B and D.]\r\n\r\nFinally, it is declared that \"the enumeration of certain rights shall\r\nnot be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people,\"\r\nand that \"the powers not granted to the United States by the\r\nConstitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the\r\nstates respectively, or to the people.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1. What provision did the Constitution make for its own ratification?\r\n\r\n2. What was the general method of ratification in the states?\r\n\r\n3. On what general grounds did the opposition to the Constitution seem\r\nto be based?\r\n\r\n4. By what feature in the Constitution was the support of South\r\nCarolina and Georgia assured?

Give an account of the adoption of the first ten amendments.\r\n\r\n10. For what do these amendments provide?\r\n\r\n11. What powers are reserved to the states?\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 8. _A Few Words about Politics._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Federal taxation.]\r\nA chief source of the opposition to the new federal government was the\r\ndread of federal taxation. People who found it hard to pay their town,\r\ncounty, and state taxes felt that it would be ruinous to have to pay\r\nstill another kind of tax. In the mere fact of federal taxation,\r\ntherefore, they were inclined to see tyranny. With people in such a\r\nmood it was necessary to proceed cautiously in devising measures of\r\nfederal taxation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Excise.]\r\nThis was well understood by our first secretary of the treasury,\r\nAlexander Hamilton, and in the course of his administration of the\r\ntreasury he was once roughly reminded of it. The two methods of federal\r\ntaxation adopted at his suggestion were duties on imports and excise on\r\na few domestic products, such as whiskey and tobacco. The excise, being\r\na tax which people could see and feel, was very unpopular, and in 1794\r\nthe opposition to it in western Pennsylvania grew into the famous\r\n\"Whiskey Insurrection,\" against which President Washington thought it\r\nprudent to send an army of 16,000 men. This formidable display of\r\nfederal power suppressed the insurrection without bloodshed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tariff.]\r\nNowhere was there any such violent opposition to Hamilton's scheme of\r\ncustom-house duties on imported goods. People had always been familiar\r\nwith such duties. In the colonial times they had been levied by the\r\nBritish government without calling forth resistance until Charles\r\nTownshend made them the vehicle of a dangerous attack upon American\r\nself-government.[32] After the Declaration of Independence, custom-house\r\nduties were levied by the state governments and the proceeds were paid\r\ninto the treasuries of the several states. Before 1789, much trouble had\r\narisen from oppressive tariff-laws enacted by some of the states against\r\nothers. By taking away from the states the power of taxing imports, the\r\nnew Constitution removed this source of irritation. It became possible\r\nto lighten the burden of custom-house duties, while by turning the full\r\nstream of them into the federal treasury an abundant national revenue\r\nwas secured at once. Thus this part of Hamilton's policy met with\r\ngeneral approval. The tariff has always been our favourite device for\r\nobtaining a national revenue. During our Civil War, indeed, the\r\nnational, government resorted extensively to direct taxation, chiefly in\r\nthe form of revenue stamps, though it also put a tax upon\r\nbilliard-tables, pianos, gold watches, and all sorts of things. But\r\nafter the return of peace these unusual taxes were one after another\r\ndiscontinued, and since then our national revenue has been raised, as in\r\nHamilton's time, from duties on imports and excise on a few domestic\r\nproducts, chiefly tobacco and distilled liquors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: See my _War of Independence_, pp. 58-83; and my\r\n_History of the United States, for Schools_, pp. 192-203.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of American political parties.]\r\nHamilton's measures as secretary of the treasury embodied an entire\r\nsystem of public policy, and the opposition to them resulted in the\r\nformation of the two political parties into which, under one name or\r\nanother, the American people have at most times been divided. Hamilton's\r\nopponents, led by Jefferson, objected to his principal measures that\r\nthey assumed powers in the national government which were not granted to\r\nit by the Constitution. Hamilton then fell back upon the Elastic\r\nClause[33] of the Constitution, and maintained that such powers were\r\n_implied_ in it. Jefferson held that this doctrine of \"implied powers\"\r\nstretched the Elastic Clause too far. He held that the Elastic Clause\r\nought to be construed strictly and narrowly; Hamilton held that\r\nit ought to be construed loosely and liberally. Hence the names\r\n\"strict-constructionist\" and \"loose-constructionist,\" which mark perhaps\r\nthe most profound and abiding antagonism in the history of American\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\n[Footnote [33]: Article I, section viii, clause 18; see above, p. 245.]\r\n\r\nPractically all will admit that the Elastic Clause, if construed\r\nstrictly, ought not to be construed _too_ narrowly; and, if construed\r\nliberally, ought not to be construed _too_ loosely. Neither party has\r\nbeen consistent in applying its principles, but in the main we can call\r\nHamilton the founder of the Federalist party, which has had for its\r\nsuccessors the National Republicans of 1828, the Whigs of 1833 to 1852,\r\nand the Republicans of 1854 to the present time; while we can call\r\nJefferson the founder of the party which called itself Republican from\r\nabout 1792 to about 1828, and since then has been known as the\r\nDemocratic party. This is rather a rough description in view of the real\r\ncomplication of the historical facts, but it is an approximation to the\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Tariff, Internal Improvements, and National Bank.]\r\nIt is not my purpose here to give a sketch of the history of American\r\nparties. Such a sketch, if given in due relative proportion, would\r\ndouble the size of this little book, of which the main purpose is to\r\ntreat of civil government in the United States with reference to its\r\n_origins_. But it may here be said in general that the practical\r\nquestions which have divided the two great parties have been concerned\r\nwith the powers of the national government as to (1) the _Tariff_; (2)\r\nthe making of roads, improving rivers and harbours, etc., under the\r\ngeneral head of _Internal Improvements_; and (3) the establishment of a\r\n_National Bank_, with the national government as partner holding shares\r\nin it and taking a leading part in the direction of its affairs. On the\r\nquestion of such a national bank the Democratic party achieved a\r\ncomplete and decisive victory under President Tyler. On the question of\r\ninternal improvements the opposite party still holds the ground, but\r\nmost of its details have been settled by the great development of the\r\npowers of private enterprise during the past sixty years, and it is not\r\nat present a \"burning question.\" The question of the tariff, however,\r\nremains to-day as a \"burning question,\" but it is no longer argued on\r\ngrounds of constitutional law, but on grounds of political economy.\r\nHamilton's construction of the Elastic Clause has to this extent\r\nprevailed, and mainly for the reason that a liberal construction of that\r\nclause was needed in order to give the national government enough power\r\nto restrict the spread of slavery and suppress the great rebellion of\r\nwhich slavery was the exciting cause.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Civil service reform.]\r\nAnother political question, more important, if possible, than that of\r\nthe Tariff, is to-day the question of the reform of the Civil Service;\r\nbut it is not avowedly made a party question. Twenty years ago both\r\nparties laughed at it; now both try to treat it with a show of respect\r\nand to render unto it lip-homage; and the control of the immediate\r\npolitical future probably lies with the party which treats it most\r\nseriously. It is a question that was not distinctly foreseen in the days\r\nof Hamilton and Jefferson, when the Constitution was made and adopted;\r\notherwise, one is inclined to believe, the framers of the Constitution\r\nwould have had something to say about it. The question as to the Civil\r\nService arises from the fact that the president has the power of\r\nappointing a vast number of petty officials, chiefly postmasters and\r\nofficials concerned with the collection of the federal revenue. Such\r\nofficials have properly nothing to do with politics; they are simply the\r\nagents or clerks or servants of the national government in conducting\r\nits business; and if the business of the national government is to be\r\nmanaged on such ordinary principles of prudence as prevail in the\r\nmanagement of private business, such servants ought to be selected for\r\npersonal merit and retained for life or during good behaviour. It did\r\nnot occur to our earlier presidents to regard the management of the\r\npublic business in any other light than this.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Origin of the \"spoils system.\"]\r\nBut as early as the beginning of the present century a vicious system\r\nwas growing up in New York and Pennsylvania. In those states the\r\nappointive offices came to be used as bribes or as rewards for partisan\r\nservices. By securing votes for a successful candidate, a man with\r\nlittle in his pocket and nothing in particular to do could obtain some\r\noffice with a comfortable salary. It would be given him as a reward, and\r\nsome other man, perhaps more competent than himself, would have to be\r\nturned out in order to make room for him. A more effective method of\r\ndriving good citizens \"out of politics\" could hardly be devised. It\r\ncalled to the front a large class of men of coarse moral fibre who\r\ngreatly preferred the excitement of speculating in politics to earning\r\nan honest living by some ordinary humdrum business. The civil service of\r\nthese states was seriously damaged in quality, politics degenerated into\r\na wild scramble for offices, salaries were paid to men who did little or\r\nno public service in return, and thus the line which separates taxation\r\nfrom robbery was often crossed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Rotation in Office.\"]\r\n[Sidenote: The \"spoils system\" made national]\r\nAbout the same time there grew up an idea that there is something\r\nespecially democratic, and therefore meritorious, about \"rotation in\r\noffice.\" Government offices were regarded as plums at which every one\r\nought to be allowed a chance to take a bite. The way was prepared in\r\n1820 by W.H. Crawford, of Georgia, who succeeded in getting the law\r\nenacted that limits the tenure of office for postmasters, revenue\r\ncollectors, and other servants of the federal government to four years.\r\nThe importance of this measure was not understood, and it excited very\r\nlittle discussion at the time. The next presidential election which\r\nresulted in a change of party was that of Jackson in 1828, and then the\r\nmethods of New York and Pennsylvania were applied on a national scale.\r\nJackson cherished the absurd belief that the administration of his\r\npredecessor Adams had been corrupt, and he turned men out of office with\r\na keen zest. During the forty years between Washington's first\r\ninauguration and Jackson's the total number of removals from office was\r\n74, and out of this number 5 were defaulters. During the first year of\r\nJackson's administration the number of changes made in the civil\r\nservice was about 2,000. [34] Such was the abrupt inauguration upon a\r\nnational scale of the so-called \"spoils system.\" The phrase originated\r\nwith W. L. Marcy, of New York, who in a speech in the senate in 1831\r\ndeclared that \"to the victors belong the spoils.\" The man who said this\r\nof course did not realize that he was making one of the most shameful\r\nremarks recorded in history. There was, however, much aptness in his\r\nphrase, inasmuch as it was a confession that the business of American\r\npolitics was about to be conducted on principles fit only for the\r\nwarfare of barbarians.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Sumner's _Jackson_, p. 147.]\r\n\r\nIn the canvass of 1840 the Whigs promised to reform the civil service,\r\nand the promise brought them many Democratic votes; but after they had\r\nwon the election, they followed Jackson's example. The Democrats\r\nfollowed in the same way in 1845, and from that time down to 1885 it was\r\ncustomary at each change of party to make a \"clean sweep\" of the\r\noffices. Soon after the Civil War the evils of the system began to\r\nattract serious attention on the part of thoughtful people. The \"spoils\r\nsystem\" has helped to sustain all manner of abominations, from grasping\r\nmonopolies and civic jobbery down to political rum-shops. The virus runs\r\nthrough everything, and the natural tendency of the evil is to grow with\r\nthe growth of the country.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Civil Service Act of 1883.]\r\nIn 1883 Congress passed the Civil Service Act, allowing the president to\r\nselect a board of examiners on whose recommendation appointments are\r\nmade. Candidates for office are subjected to an easy competitive\r\nexamination. The system has worked well in other countries, and under\r\nPresidents Arthur and Cleveland it was applied to a considerable part of\r\nthe civil service. It has also been adopted in some states and cities.\r\nThe opponents of reform object to the examination that it is not always\r\nintimately connected with the work of the office,[35] but, even if this\r\nwere so, the merit of the system lies in its removal of the offices from\r\nthe category of things known as \"patronage.\" It relieves the president\r\nof much needless work and wearisome importunity. The president and the\r\nheads of departments appoint (in many cases, through subordinates) about\r\n115,000 officials. It is therefore impossible to know much about their\r\ncharacter or competency. It becomes necessary to act by advice, and the\r\nadvice of an examining board is sure to be much better than the advice\r\nof political schemers intent upon getting a salaried office for their\r\nneedy friends. The examination system has made a fair beginning and will\r\ndoubtless be gradually improved and made more stringent. Something too\r\nhas been done toward stopping two old abuses attendant upon political\r\ncanvasses,--(1) forcing government clerks, under penalty of losing their\r\nplaces, to contribute part of their salaries for election purposes; (2)\r\nallowing government clerks to neglect their work in order to take an\r\nactive part in the canvass. Before the reform of the civil service can\r\nbe completed, however, it will be necessary to repeal Crawford's act of\r\n1820 and make the tenure of postmasters and revenue collectors as secure\r\nas that of the chief justice of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: The objection that the examination questions are\r\nirrelevant to the work of the office is often made the occasion of gross\r\nexaggeration. I have given, in Appendix I, an average sample of the\r\nexamination papers used in the customs service. It is taken from\r\nComstock's _Civil Service in the United States_, New York, Holt & Co.,\r\n1885, an excellent manual with very full particulars.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Australian ballot-system.]\r\nAnother political reform which promises excellent results is the\r\nadoption by many states of some form of the Australian ballot-system,\r\nfor the purpose of checking intimidation and bribery at elections. The\r\nballots are printed by the state, and contain the names of all the\r\ncandidates of all the parties. Against the name of each candidate the\r\nparty to which he belongs is designated, and against each name there is\r\na small vacant space to be filled with a cross. At the polling-place the\r\nballots are kept in an inclosure behind a railing, and no ballot can be\r\nbrought outside under penalty of fine or imprisonment[36]. One ballot is\r\nnailed against the wall outside the railing, so that it may be read at\r\nleisure. The space behind the railing is divided into separate booths\r\nquite screened from each other. Each booth is provided with a pencil and\r\na convenient shelf on which to write. The voter goes behind the railing,\r\ntakes the ballot which is handed him, carries it into one of the booths,\r\nand marks a cross against the names of the candidates for whom he votes.\r\nHe then puts his ballot into the box, and his name is checked off on the\r\nregister of voters of the precinct. This system is very simple, it\r\nenables a vote to be given in absolute secrecy, and it keeps \"heelers\"\r\naway from the polls. It is favourable to independence in voting,[37] and\r\nit is unfavourable to bribery, because unless the briber can follow his\r\nman to the polls and see how he votes, he cannot be sure that his bribe\r\nis effective. To make the precautions against bribery complete it will\r\ndoubtless be necessary to add to the secret ballot the English system of\r\naccounting for election expenses. All the funds used in an election must\r\npass through the hands of a small local committee, vouchers must be\r\nreceived for every penny that is expended, and after the election an\r\nitemized account must be made out and its accuracy attested under oath\r\nbefore a notary public. This system of accounting has put an end to\r\nbribery in England.[38]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: This is a brief description of the system lately adopted\r\nin Massachusetts. The penalty here mentioned is a fine not exceeding a\r\nthousand dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both such\r\nfine and such imprisonment.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: It is especially favourable to independence in voting, if\r\nthe lists of the candidates are placed in a single column, without\r\nreference to party (each name of course, having the proper party\r\ndesignation, \"Rep.,\" \"Dem.,\" \"Prohib.,\" etc., attached to it). In such\r\ncase it must necessarily take the voter some little time to find and\r\nmark each name for which he wishes to vote. If, however, the names of\r\nthe candidates are arranged according to their party, all the\r\nRepublicans in one list, all the Democrats in another, etc., this\r\narrangement is much less favourable to independence in voting and much\r\nless efficient as a check upon bribery; because the man who votes a\r\nstraight party ticket will make all his marks in a very short time,\r\nwhile the \"scratcher,\" or independent voter, will consume much more time\r\nin selecting his names. Thus people interested in seeing whether a man\r\nis voting the straight party ticket or not can form an opinion from the\r\nlength of time he spends in the booth. It is, therefore, important that\r\nthe names of all candidates should be printed in a single column.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: An important step in this direction has been taken in the\r\nNew York Corrupt Practices Act of April, 1890. See Appendix J.]\r\n\r\nComplaints of bribery and corruption have attracted especial attention\r\nin the United States during the past few years, and it is highly\r\ncreditable to the good sense of the people that measures of prevention\r\nhave been so promptly adopted by so many states. With an independent and\r\nuncorrupted ballot, and the civil service taken \"out of politics,\" all\r\nother reforms will become far more easily accomplished. These ends will\r\npresently be attained. Popular government makes many mistakes, and\r\nsometimes it is slow in finding them out; but when once it has\r\ndiscovered them it has a way of correcting them. It is the best kind of\r\ngovernment in the world, the most wisely conservative, the most steadily\r\nprogressive, and the most likely to endure.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS ON THE TEXT.\r\n\r\n1.

How much money is needed by the United States government for the\r\nexpenses of a year? How much is needed for the army, the navy, the\r\ninterest on the public debt, pensions, rivers and harbours, ordinary\r\ncivil expenses, etc.? (Answer for any recent year.)\r\n\r\n2. From what sources does the revenue come? Tell how much revenue each\r\nof the several sources has yielded in any recent year.\r\n\r\n3. What is the origin of the word _tariff_?\r\n\r\n4. What is meant by _protection_? What is meant by _free\r\ntrade_? What is meant by a _tariff for revenue only_? What is\r\nmeant by _reciprocity_? Give illustrations.\r\n\r\n5. What are some of the reasons assigned for protection?\r\n\r\n6. What are some of the reasons assigned for free trade?\r\n\r\n7. Which policy prevails among the states themselves?\r\n\r\n8. Which policy prevails between the United States and other nations?\r\n\r\n9. Mention all the kinds of United States money in circulation. Bring\r\ninto the class a national bank bill, a gold certificate, a silver\r\ncertificate, any piece that is used as money, and inquire wherein its\r\nvalue lies, what it can or cannot be used for, what the United States\r\nwill or will not give in exchange for it, and whether it is worth its\r\nface in gold or not.\r\n\r\n10. Is it right to buy silver at seventy-five cents and then put\r\nit into circulation stamped a dollar, the Government receiving the\r\nprofit? Can you get a gold dollar for a silver one?\r\n\r\n11. Is a promise to pay a dollar a real dollar? May it be as good as a\r\ndollar? If so, under what conditions?\r\n\r\n12. If gold were as common as gravel, what characteristics of it\r\nuniversally recognized would remain unchanged? What would become of\r\nits purchasing power, if it cost little or no labour to obtain it? Why\r\nis it accepted as a standard of value?\r\n\r\n13. During the Civil War gold was said to fluctuate in value, because\r\nit took two dollars of paper money, sometimes more, sometimes less,\r\nto buy one dollar in gold. Where was the real changing? What was the\r\ncause of it?\r\n\r\n14. What men are at the head of the national government at the present\r\ntime? (Think of the executive department and its primary divisions,\r\nthe legislative department, and the judicial.)\r\n\r\n15. What salaries are paid these officers? Compare American salaries\r\nwith European salaries for corresponding high positions.\r\n\r\n16. Should a president serve a second term? What is the advantage of\r\nsuch service?

Why should members of Congress be exempted from arrest in certain\r\ncases?\r\n\r\n25. Find authority in the Constitution for various things that\r\nCongress has done, such as the following:--\r\n  a. It has established a military academy at West Point.\r\n  b. It has given public lands to Pacific railroads.\r\n  c. It has authorized uniforms for letter carriers.\r\n  d. It has ordered surveys of the coast.\r\n  e. It has established the Yellowstone National Park.\r\n  f. It has voted millions of dollars for pensions.\r\n  g. It refused during the Civil War to pay its promises with silver or\r\n      gold.\r\n  h. It bought Alaska of Russia.\r\n  i. It has adopted exclusive measures towards the Chinese.\r\n\r\n26. Reverse the preceding exercise. That is, cite clauses of the\r\nConstitution, and tell what particular things Congress has done because\r\nof such authority. For example, what specific things have been done\r\nunder the following powers of Congress?--\r\n  a. To collect taxes.\r\n  b. To regulate commerce with foreign nations.\r\n  c. To coin money.\r\n  d. To establish post-roads.\r\n  e. To provide for the common defence.\r\n  f. To provide for the general welfare.\r\n\r\n27.

Show how the interests and needs of the various sections of\r\nthe country present wide differences. Compare mining sections with\r\nagricultural, and both with manufacturing; Pacific states with\r\nAtlantic; Northern states with Southern. What need of mutual\r\nconsideration exists?\r\n\r\n31. Name all the political divisions from the smallest to the greatest\r\nin which you live. A Cambridge (Mass.) boy might, for example, say, \"I\r\nlive in the third precinct of the first ward, in the first Middlesex\r\nrepresentative district, the third Middlesex senatorial district, the\r\nthird councillor district, and the fifth congressional district.\r\nMy city is Cambridge; my county, Middlesex, etc.\" Name the various\r\npersons who represent you in these several districts.\r\n\r\n32.

See also Jameson's _Essays\r\nin the Constitutional History of the United States in the Formative\r\nPeriod_, 1775-1789, Boston, 1889, a very valuable book.\r\n\r\nOn the progress toward union during the colonial period, see especially\r\nFrothingham's _Rise of the Republic of the United States_, Boston, 1872;\r\nalso Scott's _Development of Constitutional Liberty in the English\r\nColonies of America_, N.Y., 1882.\r\n\r\nBy far the ablest and most thorough book on the government of the\r\nUnited States that has ever been published is Bryce's _American\r\nCommonwealth_, 2 vols., London and N.Y., 1888. No American\r\ncitizen's education is properly completed until he has read the whole\r\nof it carefully. In connection therewith, the work of Tocqueville,\r\n_Democracy in America_, 2 vols., 6th ed., Boston, 1876, is\r\ninteresting. The Scotchman describes and discusses the American\r\ncommonwealth of to-day, the Frenchman that of sixty years ago. There\r\nis an instructive difference in the methods of the two writers,\r\nTocqueville being inclined to draw deductions from ingenious\r\ngeneralizations and to explain as natural results of democracy sundry\r\nAmerican characteristics that require a different explanation. His\r\ngreat work is admirably reviewed and criticised by Bryce, in the\r\n_J.H.U. Studies_, V., ix., _The Predictions of Hamilton and De\r\nTocqueville_.\r\n\r\nThe following manuals may be recommended: Thorpe, _The_\r\n_Government of the People of the United States_, Phila., 1889;\r\nMartin's _Text Book on Civil Government in the United States_,\r\nN.Y. and Chicago, 1875 (written with special reference to\r\nMassachusetts); Northam's _Manual of Civil Government_, Syracuse,\r\n1887 (written with special reference to New York); Ford's _American\r\nCitizen's Manual_, N.Y., 1887; Rupert's _Guide to the Study of\r\nthe History and the Constitution of the United States_, Boston,\r\n1888; Andrews's _Manual of the Constitution of the United\r\nStates_, Cincinnati, 1874; Miss Dawes, _How we are Governed_,\r\nBoston, 1888; Macy, _Our Government: How it Grew, What it Does, and\r\nHow it Does it_, Boston, 1887. The last is especially good, and\r\nmingles narrative with exposition in an unusually interesting way.\r\nNordhoff's _Politics for Young Americans_, N.Y., 1887, is a book\r\nthat ought to be read by all young Americans for its robust and sound\r\npolitical philosophy. It is suitable for boys and girls from twelve to\r\nfifteen years old. C.F. Dole's _The Citizen and the Neighbour_,\r\nBoston, 1887, is a suggestive and stimulating little book. For a\r\ncomparative survey of governmental institutions, ancient and modern,\r\nsee Woodrow Wilson's _The State: Elements of Historical and\r\nPractical Politics_, Boston, 1889. An enormous mass of matter is\r\ncompressed into this volume, and, although it inevitably suffers\r\nsomewhat from extreme condensation, it is so treated as to be both\r\nreadable and instructive. The chapter on _The State and Federal\r\nGovernments of the United States_ has been published separately,\r\nand makes a convenient little volume of 131 pages. Teachers should\r\nfind much help in MacAlister's _Syllabus of a Course of Elementary\r\nInstruction in United States History and Civil Government_, Phila.,\r\n1887.\r\n\r\nThe following books of the \"English Citizen Series,\" published by\r\nMacmillan & Co., may often be profitably consulted: M.D. Chalmers,\r\n_Local Government_; H.D. Traill, _Central Government_; F.W. Maitland,\r\n_Justice and Police_; Spencer Walpole, _The Electorate and the\r\nLegislature_; A.J. Wilson, _The National Budget_; T.H. Farrer, _The\r\nState in its Relations to Trade_; W.S. Jevons, _The State in its\r\nRelations to Labour_. The works on the English Constitution by Stubbs,\r\nGneist, Taswell-Langmead, Freeman, and Bagehot are indispensable to a\r\nthorough understanding of civil government in the United States: Stubbs,\r\n_Constitutional History of England_, 3 vols., London, 1875-78; Gneist,\r\n_History of the English Constitution_, 2d ed., 2 vols., London, 1889;\r\nTaswell-Langmead, _English Constitutional History_, 3d ed., Boston,\r\n1886; Freeman, _The Growth of the English Constitution_, London, 1872;\r\nBagehot, _The English Constitution_, revised ed., Boston, 1873. An\r\nadmirable book in this connection is Hannis Taylor's (of Alabama)\r\n_Origin and Growth of the English Constitution_, Boston, 1889. In\r\nconnection with Bagehot's _English Constitution_ the student may\r\nprofitably read Woodrow Wilson's _Congressional Government_, Boston,\r\n1885, and A.L. Lowell's _Essays in Government_, Boston, 1890. See also\r\nSir H. Maine, _Popular Government_, London, 1886; Sir G.C. Lewis on _The\r\nUse and Abuse of Certain Political Terms_, London, 1832; _Methods of\r\nObservation and Reasoning in Politics_, 2 vols., London, 1852; and\r\n_Dialogue on the Best Form of Government_, London, 1863.\r\n\r\nAmong the most valuable books ever written on the proper sphere\r\nand duties of civil government are Herbert Spencer's _Social\r\nStatics_, London, 1851; _The Study of Sociology_, 9th ed.,\r\nLondon, 1880; _The Man_ versus _The State_, London, 1884;\r\nthey are all reprinted by D. Appleton & Co., New York. The views\r\nexpressed in _Social Statics_ with regard to the tenure of land\r\nare regarded as unsound by many who are otherwise in entire sympathy\r\nwith Mr. Spencer's views, and they are ably criticised in Bonham's\r\n_Industrial Liberty_, N.Y., 1888. A book of great merit, which\r\nought to be reprinted as it is now not easy to obtain, is Toulmin\r\nSmith's _Local Self-Government and Centralization_, London, 1851.\r\nIts point of view is sufficiently indicated by the following admirable\r\npair of maxims (p. 12):--\r\n\r\nLOCAL SELF-GOVERNMENT _is that system of Government under which the\r\ngreatest number of minds, knowing the most, and having the fullest\r\nopportunities of knowing it, about the special matter in hand, and\r\nhaving the greatest interest in its well-working, have the management\r\nof it, or control over it._\r\n\r\nCENTRALIZATION _is that system of government under which the\r\nsmallest number of minds, and those knowing the least, and having the\r\nfewest opportunities of knowing it, about the special matter in\r\nhand, and having the smallest interest in its well-working, have the\r\nmanagement of it, or control over it._\r\n\r\nAn immense amount of wretched misgovernment would be avoided if all\r\nlegislators and all voters would engrave these wholesome definitions\r\nupon their minds. In connection with the books just mentioned much\r\ndetailed and valuable information may be found in the collections of\r\nessays edited by J.W. Probyn, _Local Government and Taxation_ [in\r\nvarious countries], London, 1875; _Local Government and Taxation\r\nin the United_ _Kingdom_, London, 1882. See also R.T. Ely's\r\n_Taxation in American States and Cities_, N.Y., 1889.\r\n\r\nThe most elaborate work on our political history is that of Hermann\r\nvon Holst, _Constitutional and Political History of the United\r\nStates_, translated from the German by J.J. Lalor, vols. i.-vi.\r\n(1787-1859), Chicago, 1877-89. In spite of a somewhat too pronounced\r\npartisan bias, its value is great. See also Schouler's _History\r\nof the United States under the Constitution_, vols. i.-iv.\r\n(1783-1847), new ed., N.Y., 1890. The most useful handbook, alike\r\nfor teachers and for pupils, is Alexander Johnston's _History of\r\nAmerican Politics_, 2d ed., N.Y., 1882. _The United States_,\r\nN.Y., 1889, by the same author, is also excellent. Every school\r\nshould possess a copy of Lalor's _Cyclopaedia of Political Science,\r\nPolitical Economy, and the Political History of the United States_,\r\n3 vols., Chicago, 1882-84. The numerous articles in it relating to\r\nAmerican history are chiefly by Alexander Johnston, whose mastery of\r\nhis subject was simply unrivalled. His death in 1889, at the early age\r\nof forty, must be regarded as a national calamity. For a manual of\r\nconstitutional law, Cooley's _General Principles of Constitutional\r\nLaw in the United States of America_, Boston, 1880, is to be\r\nrecommended. The reader may fitly supplement his general study of\r\ncivil government by the little book of E.P. Dole, _Talks about\r\nLaw: a Popular Statement of What our Law is and How it is to be\r\nAdministered_, Boston, 1887.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the political history, Stanwood's _History of\r\nPresidential Elections_, 2d ed., Boston, 1888, will be found\r\nuseful. See also Lawton's _American Caucus System_, N.Y., 1885.\r\nOn the general subject of civil service reform, see Eaton's _Civil\r\nService in Great Britain: a History of Abuses and Reforms, and their\r\nBearing upon American Politics_, N.Y., 1880. Comstock's _Civil\r\nService in the United States_, N.Y., 1885, is a catalogue of\r\noffices, with full account of civil service rules, examinations,\r\nspecimens of examination papers, etc.; also some of the state rules,\r\nas in New York, Massachusetts, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI would here call attention to some publications by the Directors\r\nof the Old South Studies in History and Politics,--first, _The\r\nConstitution of the United States, with Historical and Bibliographical\r\nNotes and Outlines, for Study_, prepared by E.D. Mead (sold by\r\nD.C. Heath and Co., Boston, for 25 cents); secondly, the _Old\r\nSouth Leaflets_, furnished to schools and the trade by the same\r\npublishers, at 5 cents a copy or $3.00 a hundred. These leaflets are\r\nfor the most part reprints of important original papers, furnished\r\nwith valuable historical and bibliographical notes. The eighteen\r\nissued up to this time (July, 1890) are as follows: 1. The\r\nConstitution of the United States; 2. The Articles of Confederation;\r\n3. The Declaration of Independence; 4. Washington's Farewell Address;\r\n5. Magna Charta; 6. Vane's \"Healing Question;\" 7. Charter of\r\nMassachusetts Bay, 1629; 8. Fundamental Orders of Connecticut, 1639;\r\n9. Franklin's Plan of Union, 1754; 10. Washington's Inaugurals;\r\n11. Lincoln's Inaugurals and Emancipation Proclamation; 12. The\r\nFederalist, Nos. 1 and 2; 13. The Ordinance of 1787; 14. The\r\nConstitution of Ohio; 15. Washington's \"Legacy\"; 16. Washington's\r\nLetter to Benjamin Harrison, Governor of Virginia, on the Opening of\r\nCommunication with the West; 17. Verrazano's Voyage, 1524; 18. Federal\r\nConstitution of the Swiss Confederation.\r\n\r\nHoward Preston's _Documents Illustrative of American History_,\r\nN.Y., 1886, contains the following: First Virginia Charter, 1606;\r\nSecond Virginia Charter, 1609; Third Virginia Charter, 1612; Mayflower\r\nCompact, 1620; Massachusetts Charter, 1629; Maryland Charter, 1632;\r\nFundamental Orders of Connecticut, 1639; New England Confederation,\r\n1643; Connecticut Charter, 1662; Rhode Island Charter, 1663;\r\nPennsylvania Charter, 1681; Perm's Plan of Union, 1697; Georgia\r\nCharter, 1732; Franklin's Plan of Union, 1754; Declaration of Rights,\r\n1765; Declaration of Rights, 1774; Non-Importation Agreement, 1774;\r\nVirginia Bill of Rights, 1776; Declaration of Independence, 1776;\r\nArticles of Confederation, 1777; Treaty of Peace, 1783; Northwest\r\nOrdinance, 1787; Constitution of the United States, 1787; Alien and\r\nSedition Laws, 1798; Virginia Resolutions, 1798; Kentucky Resolutions,\r\n1798; Kentucky Resolutions, 1799; Nullification Ordinance, 1832;\r\nOrdinance of Secession, 1860; South Carolina Declaration of\r\nIndependence, 1860; Emancipation Proclamation, 1863.\r\n\r\nSee also Poore's _Federal and State Constitutions, Colonial\r\nCharters, and other Organic Laws of the United States_, 2 vols.,\r\nWashington, 1877.\r\n\r\nThe series of essays entitled _The Federalist_, written by\r\nHamilton, Madison, and Jay, in 1787-88, while the ratification of the\r\nConstitution was in question, will always remain indispensable as an\r\nintroduction to the thorough study of the principles upon which our\r\nfederal government is based. The most recent edition is by\r\nH.C. Lodge, N.Y., 1888. For the systematic and elaborate study of the\r\nConstitution, see Foster's _References to the Constitution of the\r\nUnited States_, a little pamphlet of 50 pages published by the\r\n\"Society for Political Education,\" 330 Pearl St., New York, 1890,\r\nprice 25 cents. The student who should pursue to the end the line of\r\nresearch marked out in this pamphlet ought thereby to become quite an\r\nauthority on the subject.\r\n\r\nFor very pleasant and profitable reading, in connection with the\r\nformation and interpretation of the Constitution, and the political\r\nhistory of our country from 1763 to 1850, we have the \"American\r\nStatesmen Series,\" edited by J.T. Morse, and published by Houghton,\r\nMifflin & Co., Boston, 1882-90: _Benjamin Franklin_, by J.T.\r\nMorse; _Patrick Henry_, by M.C. Tyler; _Samuel Adams_, by\r\nJ.K. Hosmer; _George Washington_, by H.C. Lodge, 2 vols.;\r\n_John Adams and Thomas Jefferson_, by J.T. Morse; _Alexander\r\nHamilton_, by H.C. Lodge; _Gouverneur Morris_, by T. Roosevelt;\r\n_James Madison_, by S.H. Gay; _James Monroe_ by D.C. Gilman;\r\n_Albert Gallatin_, by J.A. Stevens; _John Randolph_, by H.\r\nAdams; _John Jay_, by G. Pellew; _John Marshall_, by A.B.\r\nMagruder; _John Quincy Adams_, by J.T. Morse; _John C. Calhoun_,\r\nby H. von Holst; _Andrew Jackson_, by W.G. Sumner; _Martin Van\r\nBuren_, by E.M. Shepard; _Henry Clay_, by C. Schurz, 2 vols.;\r\n_Daniel Webster_, by H.C. Lodge; _Thomas H, Benton_, by T. Roosevelt.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with the questions on page 269 relating to tariff,\r\ncurrency, etc., references to some works on political economy are\r\nneeded. The arguments in favour of protectionism are set forth in\r\nBowen's _American Political Economy_, last ed., N.Y., 1870;\r\nthe arguments in favour of free trade are set forth in Perry's\r\n_Political Economy_, 19th ed., N.Y., 1887; and for an able and\r\nimpartial historical survey, Taussig's _Tariff History of the United\r\nStates_, N.Y., 1888, may be recommended. For a lucid view of\r\ncurrency, see Jevons's _Money and the Mechanism of Exchange_,\r\nN.Y., 1875.\r\n\r\nA useful work on the Australian method of voting is Wigmore's _The\r\nAustralian Ballot System_, 2d ed., Boston, 1890.\r\n\r\nIn connection with some of the questions on page 271, the student may\r\nprofitably consult Woolsey's _International Law_, 5th ed., N.Y.,\r\n1879. NOTE TO PAGE 226.\r\n\r\nBy the act of February 3, 1887, the second Monday in January is fixed\r\nfor the meeting of the electoral colleges in all the states. The\r\nprovisions relating to the first Wednesday in January are repealed.\r\nThe interval between the second Monday in January and the second\r\nWednesday in February remains available for the settlement of disputed\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nNOTE TO PAGE 250.\r\n\r\nIn order to relieve the supreme court of the United States, which\r\nhad come to be overburdened with business, a new court, with limited\r\nappellate jurisdiction, called the _circuit court of appeals_,\r\nwas organized in 1892. It consists primarily of nine _appeal\r\njudges_, one for each of the nine circuits. For any given circuit\r\nthe supreme court justice of the circuit, the appeal judge of the\r\ncircuit, and the circuit judge constitute the court of appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX A.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARTICLES OF CONFEDERATION.\r\n\r\n_Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union between the States\r\nof New Hampshire, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island and Providence\r\nPlantations, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and\r\nGeorgia._\r\n\r\nARTICLE I.--The style of this Confederacy shall be, \"The United States\r\nof America.\"\r\n\r\nART.

III.--The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league\r\nof friendship with each other, for their common defence, the security\r\nof their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding\r\nthemselves to assist each other against all force offered to, or\r\nattacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion,\r\nsovereignty, trade, or any other pretence whatever.\r\n\r\nART. IV.--The better to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and\r\nintercourse among the people of the different States in this Union,\r\nthe free inhabitants of each of these States, paupers, vagabonds, and\r\nfugitives from justice excepted, shall be entitled to all privileges\r\nand immunities of free citizens in the several States; and the people\r\nof each State shall have free ingress and egress to and from any\r\nother State, and shall enjoy therein all the privileges of trade and\r\ncommerce subject to the same duties, impositions, and restrictions as\r\nthe inhabitants thereof respectively; provided that such restrictions\r\nshall not extend so far as to prevent the removal of property imported\r\ninto any State to any other State of which the owner is an inhabitant;\r\nprovided also, that no imposition, duties, or restriction\r\nshall be laid by any State on the property of the United States or\r\neither of them. If any person guilty of, or charged with, treason,\r\nfelony, or other high misdemeanour in any State shall flee from\r\njustice and be found in any of the United States, he shall, upon\r\ndemand of the governor or executive power of the State from which he\r\nfled, be delivered up and removed to the State having jurisdiction of\r\nhis offense. Full faith and credit shall be given in each of these\r\nStates to the records, acts, and judicial proceedings of the courts\r\nand magistrates of every other State.\r\n\r\nART. V.--For the more convenient management of the general interests\r\nof the United States, delegates shall be annually appointed in such\r\nmanner as the Legislature of each State shall direct, to meet in\r\nCongress on the first Monday in November, in every year, with a power\r\nreserved to each State to recall its delegates, or any of them, at\r\nany time within the year, and to send others in their stead for the\r\nremainder of the year. No State shall be represented in Congress by\r\nless than two, nor by more than seven members; and no person shall be\r\ncapable of being a delegate for more than three years in any term\r\nof six years; nor shall any person, being a delegate, be capable of\r\nholding any office under the United States for which he, or another\r\nfor his benefit, receives any salary, fees, or emolument of any kind.\r\nEach State shall maintain its own delegates in any meeting of the\r\nStates and while they act as members of the Committee of the States.\r\nIn determining questions in the United States, in Congress assembled,\r\neach State shall have one vote. Freedom of speech and debate in\r\nCongress shall not be impeached or questioned in any court or place\r\nout of Congress; and the members of Congress shall be protected in\r\ntheir persons from arrests and imprisonment during the time of their\r\ngoing to and from, and attendance on, Congress, except for treason,\r\nfelony, or breach of the peace.\r\n\r\nART. VI.--No State, without the consent of the United States, in\r\nCongress assembled, shall send any embassy to, or receive any embassy\r\nfrom, or enter into any conference, agreement, alliance, or treaty\r\nwith any king, prince, or state; nor shall any person holding any\r\noffice of profit or trust under the United States, or any of them,\r\naccept of any present, emolument, office, or title of any kind\r\nwhatever from any king, prince, or foreign state; nor shall the United\r\nStates, in Congress assembled, or any of them, grant any title of\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\nNo two or more States shall enter into any treaty, confederation, or\r\nalliance whatever between them, without the consent of the United\r\nStates, in Congress assembled, specifying accurately the purposes for\r\nwhich the same is to be entered into, and how long it shall continue.\r\n\r\nNo State shall lay any imposts or duties which may interfere with\r\nany stipulations in treaties entered into by the United States, in\r\nCongress assembled, with any king, prince, or state, in pursuance of\r\nany treaties already proposed by Congress to the courts of France and\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nNo vessel of war shall be kept up in time of peace by any State,\r\nexcept such number only as shall be deemed necessary by the United\r\nStates, in Congress assembled, for the defence of such State or its\r\ntrade, nor shall any body of forces be kept up by any State in time\r\nof peace, except such number only as, in the judgment of the United\r\nStates, in Congress assembled, shall be deemed requisite to garrison\r\nthe forts necessary for the defence of such State; but every State\r\nshall always keep up a well-regulated and disciplined militia,\r\nsufficiently armed and accoutered, and shall provide and constantly\r\nhave ready for use in public stores a due number of field-pieces and\r\ntents, and a proper quantity of arms, ammunition, and camp equipage.\r\n\r\nNo State shall engage in any war without the consent of the United\r\nStates, in Congress assembled, unless such State be actually invaded\r\nby enemies, or shall have received certain advice of a resolution\r\nbeing formed by some nation of Indians to invade such State, and the\r\ndanger is so imminent as not to admit of a delay till the United\r\nStates, in Congress assembled, can be consulted; nor shall any State\r\ngrant commissions to any ships or vessels of war, nor letters of\r\nmarque or reprisal, except it be after a declaration of war by the\r\nUnited States, in Congress assembled, and then only against the\r\nkingdom or state, and the subjects thereof, against which war has been\r\nso declared, and under such regulations as shall be established by the\r\nUnited States, in Congress assembled, unless such State be infested\r\nby pirates, in which case vessels of war may be fitted out for that\r\noccasion, and kept so long as the danger shall continue, or until the\r\nUnited States, in Congress assembled, shall determine otherwise.\r\n\r\nART. VII.--When land forces are raised by any State for the common\r\ndefence, all officers of or under the rank of Colonel shall be\r\nappointed by the Legislature of each State respectively by whom such\r\nforces shall be raised, or in such manner as such State shall direct,\r\nand all vacancies shall be filled up by the State which first made the\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nART. VIII.--All charges of war, and all other expenses that shall be\r\nincurred for the common defence, or general welfare, and allowed by\r\nthe United States, in Congress assembled, shall be defrayed out of\r\na common treasury, which shall be supplied by the several States in\r\nproportion to the value of all land within each State, granted to,\r\nor surveyed for, any person, as such land and the buildings and\r\nimprovements thereon shall be estimated, according to such mode as the\r\nUnited States, in Congress assembled, shall, from time to time, direct\r\nand appoint. The taxes for paying that proportion shall be laid and\r\nlevied by the authority and direction of the Legislatures of the\r\nseveral States, within the time agreed upon by the United States, in\r\nCongress assembled.\r\n\r\nART. IX.--The United States, in Congress assembled, shall have the\r\nsole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war,\r\nexcept in the cases mentioned in the sixth Article; of sending and\r\nreceiving ambassadors; entering into treaties and alliances, provided\r\nthat no treaty of commerce shall be made, whereby the legislative\r\npower of the respective States shall be restrained from imposing such\r\nimposts and duties on foreigners as their own people are subjected to,\r\nor from prohibiting the exportation or importation of any species of\r\ngoods or commodities whatever; of establishing rules for deciding, in\r\nall cases, what captures on land and water shall be legal, and in what\r\nmanner prizes taken by land or naval forces in the service of the\r\nUnited States shall be divided or appropriated; of granting letters of\r\nmarque and reprisal in times of peace; appointing courts for the trial\r\nof piracies and felonies committed on the high seas; and establishing\r\ncourts for receiving and determining finally appeals in all cases of\r\ncaptures; provided that no member of Congress shall be appointed a\r\njudge of any of the said courts.\r\n\r\nThe United States, in Congress assembled, shall also be the last\r\nresort on appeal in all disputes and differences now subsisting,\r\nor that hereafter may arise between two or more States concerning\r\nboundary jurisdiction, or any other cause whatever; which authority\r\nshall always be exercised in the manner following: Whenever the\r\nlegislative or executive authority, or lawful agent of any State in\r\ncontroversy with another, shall present a petition to Congress,\r\nstating the matter in question, and praying for a hearing, notice\r\nthereof shall be given by order of Congress to the legislative or\r\nexecutive authority of the other State in controversy, and a day\r\nassigned for the appearance of the parties by their lawful agents,\r\nwho shall then be directed to appoint, by joint consent,\r\ncommissioners or judges to constitute a court for hearing and\r\ndetermining the matter in question; but if they cannot agree, Congress\r\nshall name three persons out of each of the United States, and from\r\nthe list of such persons each party shall alternately strike out\r\none, the petitioners beginning, until the number shall be reduced to\r\nthirteen; and from that number not less than seven nor more than nine\r\nnames, as Congress shall direct, shall, in the presence of Congress,\r\nbe drawn out by lot; and the persons whose names shall be so drawn,\r\nor any five of them, shall be commissioners or judges, to hear and\r\nfinally determine the controversy, so always as a major part of the\r\njudges who shall hear the cause shall agree in the determination;

PRESIDENT: I confess that there are several parts of this\r\nConstitution which I do not at present approve, but I am not sure I\r\nshall never approve them. For, having lived long, I have experienced\r\nmany instances of being obliged by better information, or fuller\r\nconsideration, to change opinions even on important subjects which I\r\nonce thought right, but found to be otherwise. It is therefore that, the\r\nolder I grow, the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment, and to pay\r\nmore respect to the judgment of others. Most men, indeed, as well as\r\nmost sects in religion, think themselves in possession of all truth, and\r\nthat wherever others differ from them it is so far error. Steele, a\r\nProtestant, in a dedication tells the Pope that the only difference\r\nbetween our churches, in their opinions of the certainty of their\r\ndoctrines, is, 'the Church of Rome is infallible, and the Church of\r\nEngland is never in the wrong.' But though many private persons think\r\nalmost as highly of their own infallibility as of that of their sect,\r\nfew express it so naturally as a certain French lady who, in a dispute\r\nwith her sister, said, 'I don't know how it happens, sister, but I meet\r\nwith nobody but myself that is always in the right--_il n'y a que moi\r\nqui a toujours raison.' In these sentiments, sir, I agree to this\r\nConstitution, with all its faults, if they are such, because I think a\r\nGeneral Government necessary for us, and there is no form of government\r\nbut what may be a blessing to the people if well administered; and\r\nbelieve further, that this is likely to be well administered for a\r\ncourse of years, and can only end in despotism, as other forms have done\r\nbefore it, when the people shall become so corrupted as to need despotic\r\ngovernment, being incapable of any other. I doubt, too, whether any\r\nother Convention we can obtain may be able to make a better\r\nConstitution. For when you assemble a number of men to have the\r\nadvantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those men\r\nall their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their\r\nlocal interests, and their selfish views. From such an assembly can a\r\nperfect production be expected? It, therefore, astonishes me, sir, to\r\nfind this system approaching so near to perfection as it does: and I\r\nthink it will astonish our enemies, who are waiting with confidence to\r\nhear that our councils are confounded, like those of the builders of\r\nBabel, and that our States are on the point of separation, only to meet\r\nhereafter for the purpose of cutting one another's throats. Thus I\r\nconsent, sir, to this Constitution because I expect no better, and\r\nbecause I am not sure that it is not the best. The opinions I have had\r\nof its errors I sacrifice to the public good. I have never whispered a\r\nsyllable of them abroad. Within these walls they were born and here they\r\nshall die. If every one of us, in returning to our constituents, were to\r\nreport the objections he has had to it, and endeavour to gain partisans\r\nin support of them, we might prevent its being generally received, and\r\nthereby lose all the salutary effects and great advantages resulting\r\nnaturally in our favour among foreign nations as well as among\r\nourselves, from our real or apparent unanimity. Much of the strength and\r\nefficiency of any government, in procuring and securing happiness to the\r\npeople, depends on opinion--on the general opinion of the goodness of\r\nthe government as well as of the wisdom and integrity of its governors.\r\nI hope, therefore, that for our own sakes, as a part of the people, and\r\nfor the sake of posterity, we shall act heartily and unanimously in\r\nrecommending this Constitution (if approved by Congress and confirmed by\r\nthe Conventions) wherever our influence may extend, and turn our future\r\nthoughts and endeavours to the means of having it well administered. On\r\nthe whole, sir, I cannot help expressing a wish that every member of the\r\nConvention who may still have objections to it would, with me, on this\r\noccasion doubt a little of his own infallibility, and, to make manifest\r\nour unanimity, put his name to this instrument.\r\n\r\nHe then moved that the Constitution be signed by the members, and\r\noffered the following as a convenient form, viz.: \"Done in Convention\r\nby the unanimous consent of _the States_ present the seventeenth\r\nof September, etc. In witness whereof we have hereunto subscribed\r\nour names.\" This ambiguous form had been drawn up by Mr. Gouverneur\r\nMorris, in order to gain the dissenting members, and put into the\r\nhands of Doctor Franklin, that it might have the better chance of\r\nsuccess. [Considerable discussion followed, Randolph and Gerry stating\r\ntheir reasons for refusing to sign the Constitution. Mr. Hamilton\r\nexpressed his anxiety that every member should sign. A few characters\r\nof consequence, he said, by opposing or even refusing to sign the\r\nConstitution, might do infinite mischief by kindling the latent sparks\r\nthat lurk under an enthusiasm in favour of the Convention which may\r\nsoon subside. No man's ideas were more remote from the plan than his\r\nown were known to be; but is it possible to deliberate between anarchy\r\nand convulsion on one side, and the chance of good to be expected from\r\nthe plan on the other? This discussion concluded, the Convention voted\r\nthat its journal and other papers should be retained by the President,\r\nsubject to the order of Congress.] The members then proceeded to sign\r\nthe Constitution as finally amended. The Constitution being signed by\r\nall the members except Mr. Randolph, Mr. Mason, and Mr. Gerry, who\r\ndeclined giving it the sanction of their names, the Convention\r\ndissolved itself by an adjournment sine die.\r\n\r\nWhilst the last members were signing, Doctor Franklin, looking towards\r\nthe President's chair, at the back of which a rising sun happened to\r\nbe painted, observed to a few members near him that painters had found\r\nit difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun.\r\nI have, said he, often and often, in the course of the session, and\r\nthe vicissitudes of my hopes and fears as to its issue, looked at that\r\nbehind the President without being able to tell whether it was rising\r\nor setting; but now, at length, I have the happiness to know that it\r\nis a rising, and not a setting, sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX C.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAGNA CHARTA.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: I have, by permission, reproduced the _Old South\r\nLeaflet_, with its notes, etc., in full.]\r\n\r\nOR THE GREAT CHARTER OF KING JOHN, GRANTED JUNE 15, A.D. 1215.\r\n\r\nJOHN, by the Grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, Date of\r\nNormandy, Aquitaine, and Count of Anjou, to his Archbishops, Bishops,\r\nAbbots, Earls, Barons, Justiciaries, Foresters, Sheriffs, Governors,\r\nOfficers, and to all Bailiffs, and his faithful subjects, greeting.\r\nKnow ye, that we, in the presence of God, and for the salvation of\r\nour soul, and the souls of all our ancestors and heirs, and unto the\r\nhonour of God and the advancement of Holy Church, and amendment of\r\nour Realm, by advice of our venerable Fathers, Stephen, Archbishop\r\nof Canterbury, Primate of all England and Cardinal of the Holy Roman\r\nChurch: Henry, Archbishop of Dublin; William, of London; Peter, of\r\nWinchester; Jocelin of Bath and Glastonbury; Hugh, of Lincoln; Walter,\r\nof Worcester; William, of Coventry: Benedict, of Rochester--Bishops:\r\nof Master Pandulph, Sub-Deacon and Familiar of our Lord the Pope;\r\nBrother Aymeric, Master of the Knights-Templars in England; and of the\r\nnoble Persons, William Marescall, Earl of Pembroke; William, Earl of\r\nSalisbury; William, Earl of Warren; William, Earl of Arundel; Alan de\r\nGalloway, Constable of Scotland; Warin FitzGerald, Peter FitzHerbert,\r\nand Hubert de Burgh, Seneschal of Poitou; Hugh de Neville, Matthew\r\nFitzHerbert, Thomas Basset, Alan Basset, Philip of Albiney, Robert\r\nde Roppell, John Mareschal, John FitzHugh, and others, our liegemen,\r\nhave, in the first place, granted to God, and by this our present\r\nCharter confirmed, for us and our heirs for ever:--\r\n\r\n1. That the Church of England shall be free, and have her whole rights,\r\nand her liberties inviolable; and we will have them so observed, that it\r\nmay appear thence that the freedom of elections, which is reckoned chief\r\nand indispensable to the English Church, and which we granted and\r\nconfirmed by our Charter, and obtained the confirmation of the same from\r\nour Lord the Pope Innocent III., before the discord between us and our\r\nbarons, was granted of mere free will; which Charter we shall observe,\r\nand we do will it to be faithfully observed by our heirs for ever.\r\n\r\n2. We also have granted to all the freemen of our kingdom, for us and\r\nfor our heirs for ever, all the underwritten liberties, to be had and\r\nholden by them and their heirs, of us and our heirs for ever: If\r\nany of our earls, or barons, or others, who hold of us in chief by\r\nmilitary service, shall die, and at the time of his death his heir\r\nshall be of full age, and owe a relief, he shall have his inheritance\r\nby the ancient relief--that is to say, the heir or heirs of an earl,\r\nfor a whole earldom, by a hundred pounds; the heir or heirs of a\r\nbaron, for a whole barony, by a hundred pounds; the heir or heirs of a\r\nknight, for a whole knight's fee, by a hundred shillings at most; and\r\nwhoever oweth less shall give less, according to the ancient custom of\r\nfees.\r\n\r\n3. But if the heir of any such shall be under age, and shall be in\r\nward, when he comes of age he shall have his inheritance without\r\nrelief and without fine.\r\n\r\n4. The keeper of the land of such an heir being under age, shall\r\ntake of the land of the heir none but reasonable issues, reasonable\r\ncustoms, and reasonable services, and that without destruction and\r\nwaste of his men and his goods; and if we commit the custody of any\r\nsuch lands to the sheriff, or any other who is answerable to us for\r\nthe issues of the land, and he shall make destruction and waste of the\r\nlands which he hath in custody, we will take of him amends, and the\r\nland shall be committed to two lawful and discreet men of that fee,\r\nwho shall answer for the issues to us, or to him to whom we shall\r\nassign them; and if we sell or give to any one the custody of any such\r\nlands, and he therein make destruction or waste, he shall lose the\r\nsame custody, which shall be committed to two lawful and discreet men\r\nof that fee, who shall in like manner answer to us as aforesaid.\r\n\r\n5. But the keeper, so long as he shall have the custody of the land,\r\nshall keep up the houses, parks, warrens, ponds, mills, and other\r\nthings pertaining to the land, out of the issues of the same land; and\r\nshall deliver to the heir, when he comes of full age, his whole land,\r\nstocked with ploughs and carriages, according as the time of wainage\r\nshall require, and the issues of the land can reasonably bear.\r\n\r\n6. Heirs shall be married without disparagement, and so that before\r\nmatrimony shall be contracted, those who are near in blood to the heir\r\nshall have notice. 7. A widow, after the death of her husband, shall\r\nforthwith and without difficulty have her marriage and inheritance;\r\nnor shall she give anything for her dower, or her marriage, or her\r\ninheritance, which her husband and she held at the day of his death;\r\nand she may remain in the mansion house of her husband forty days\r\nafter his death, within which time her dower shall be assigned.\r\n\r\n8. No widow shall be distrained to marry herself, so long as she has a\r\nmind to live without a husband; but yet she shall give security that\r\nshe will not marry without our assent, if she hold of us; or without\r\nthe consent of the lord of whom she holds, if she hold of another.\r\n\r\n9. Neither we nor our bailiffs shall seize any land or rent for any\r\ndebt so long as the chattels of the debtor are sufficient to pay the\r\ndebt; nor shall the sureties of the debtor be distrained so long\r\nas the principal debtor has sufficient to pay the debt; and if the\r\nprincipal debtor shall fail in the payment of the debt, not having\r\nwherewithal to pay it, then the sureties shall answer the debt; and\r\nif they will they shall have the lands and rents of the debtor, until\r\nthey shall be satisfied for the debt which they paid for him, unless\r\nthe principal debtor can show himself acquitted thereof against the\r\nsaid sureties.\r\n\r\n10. If any one have borrowed anything of the Jews, more or less, and\r\ndie before the debt be satisfied, there shall be no interest paid for\r\nthat debt, so long as the heir is under age, of whomsoever he may\r\nhold; and if the debt falls into our hands, we will only take the\r\nchattel mentioned in the deed.\r\n\r\n11. And if any one shall die indebted to the Jews, his wife shall\r\nhave her dower and pay nothing of that debt; and if the deceased left\r\nchildren under age, they shall have necessaries provided for them,\r\naccording to the tenement of the deceased; and out of the residue the\r\ndebt shall be paid, saving, however, the service due to the lords, and\r\nin like manner shall it be done touching debts due to others than the\r\nJews.\r\n\r\n12. _No scutage or aid[26] shall be imposed in our kingdom, unless\r\nby the general council of our kingdom_; except for ransoming our\r\nperson, making our eldest son a knight, and once for marrying our\r\neldest daughter; and for these there shall be paid no more than a\r\nreasonable aid. In like manner it shall be concerning the aids of the\r\nCity of London.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: In the time of the feudal system _scutage_ was a\r\ndirect tax in commutation for military service; _aids_ were\r\ndirect taxes paid by the tenant to his lord for ransoming his person\r\nif taken captive, and for helping defray the expenses of knighting his\r\neldest son and marrying his eldest daughter.]\r\n\r\n13. And the City of London shall have all its ancient liberties and\r\nfree customs, as well by land as by water: furthermore, we will and\r\ngrant that all other cities and boroughs, and towns and ports, shall\r\nhave all their liberties and free customs.\r\n\r\n14. _And for holding the general council of the kingdom concerning\r\nthe assessment of aids, except in the three cases aforesaid, and\r\nfor the assessing of scutages, we shall cause to be summoned the\r\narchbishops, bishops, abbots, earls, and greater barons of the realm,\r\nsingly by our letters. And furthermore, we shall cause to be summoned\r\ngenerally, by our sheriffs and bailiffs, all others who hold of us\r\nin chief, for a certain day, that is to say, forty days before their\r\nmeeting at least, and to a certain place; and in all letters of such\r\nsummons we will declare the cause of such summons. And summons being\r\nthus made, the business shall proceed on the day appointed, according\r\nto the advice of such as shall be present, although all that were\r\nsummoned come not._\r\n\r\n15. We will not for the future grant to any one that he may take aid\r\nof his own free tenants, unless to ransom his body, and to make his\r\neldest son a knight, and once to marry his eldest daughter; and for\r\nthis there shall be only paid a reasonable aid.\r\n\r\n16. No man shall be distrained to perform more service for a knight's\r\nfee, or other free tenement, than is due from thence.\r\n\r\n17. Common pleas shall not follow our court, but shall be holden in\r\nsome place certain.\r\n\r\n18. Trials upon the Writs of Novel Disseisin,[27] and of Mort\r\nd'ancestor,[28] and of Darrein Presentment,[29] shall not be taken but\r\nin their proper counties, and after this manner: We, or if we should\r\nbe out of the realm, our chief justiciary, will send two justiciaries\r\nthrough every county four times a year, who, with four knights of each\r\ncounty, chosen by the county, shall hold the said assizes[30] in the\r\ncounty, on the day, and at the place appointed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: Dispossession.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Death of the ancestor; that is, in cases of disputed\r\nsuccession to land.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Last presentation to a benefice.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: The word Assize here means an assembly of knights or\r\nother substantial persons, held at a certain time and place where\r\nthey sit with the Justice. 'Assisa' or 'Assize' is also taken\r\nfor the court, place, or time at which the writs of Assize are\r\ntaken.--_Thompson's Notes._]\r\n\r\n19. And if any matters cannot be determined on the day appointed\r\nfor holding the assizes in each county, so many of the knights and\r\nfreeholders as have been at the assizes aforesaid shall stay to decide\r\nthem as is necessary, according as there is more or less business.\r\n\r\n20. A freeman shall not be amerced for a small offence, but only\r\naccording to the degree of the offence; and for a great crime\r\naccording to the heinousness of it, saving to him his contenement;[31]\r\nand after the same manner a merchant, saving to him his merchandise.\r\nAnd a villein shall be amerced after the same manner, saving to him\r\nhis wainage, if he falls under our mercy; and none of the aforesaid\r\namerciaments shall be assessed but by the oath of honest men in the\r\nneighbourhood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: \"That by which a person subsists and which is essential\r\nto his rank in life.\"]\r\n\r\n21. Earls and barons shall not be amerced but by their peers, and\r\nafter the degree of the offence.\r\n\r\n22. No ecclesiastical person shall be amerced for his lay tenement,\r\nbut according to the proportion of the others aforesaid, and not\r\naccording to the value of his ecclesiastical benefice.\r\n\r\n23. Neither a town nor any tenant shall be distrained to make bridges\r\nor embankments, unless that anciently and of right they are bound to\r\ndo it.\r\n\r\n24. No sheriff, constable, coroner, or other our bailiffs, shall hold\r\n\"Pleas of the Crown.\" [32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: These are suits conducted in the name of the Crown\r\nagainst criminal offenders.]\r\n\r\n25. All counties, hundreds, wapentakes, and trethings, shall stand at\r\nthe old rents, without any increase, except in our demesne manors.\r\n\r\n26. If any one holding of us a lay fee die, and the sheriff, or our\r\nbailiffs, show our letters patent of summons for debt which the dead\r\nman did owe to us, it shall be lawful for the sheriff or our bailiff\r\nto attach and register the chattels of the dead, found upon his lay\r\nfee, to the amount of the debt, by the view of lawful men, so as\r\nnothing be removed until our whole clear debt be paid; and the rest\r\nshall be left to the executors to fulfil the testament of the dead;\r\nand if there be nothing due from him to us, all the chattels shall\r\ngo to the use of the dead, saving to his wife and children their\r\nreasonable shares.[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: A person's goods were divided into three parts, of which\r\none went to his wife, another to his heirs, and a third he was at\r\nliberty to dispose of. If he had no child, his widow had half; and if he\r\nhad children, but no wife, half was divided amongst them. These several\r\nsums were called \"reasonable shares.\" Through the testamentary\r\njurisdiction they gradually acquired, the clergy often contrived to get\r\ninto their own hands all the residue of the estate without paying the\r\ndebts of the estate.]\r\n\r\n27. If any freeman shall die intestate, his chattels shall be\r\ndistributed by the hands of his nearest relations and friends, by view\r\nof the Church, saving to every one his debts which the deceased owed\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n28. No constable or bailiff of ours shall take corn or other chattels\r\nof any man unless he presently give him money for it, or hath respite\r\nof payment by the goodwill of the seller.\r\n\r\n29. No constable shall distrain any knight to give money for\r\ncastle-guard, if he himself will do it in his person, or by another\r\nable man, in case he cannot do it through any reasonable cause. And if\r\nwe have carried or sent him into the army, he shall be free from such\r\nguard for the time he shall be in the army by our command.\r\n\r\n30. No sheriff or bailiff of ours, or any other, shall take horses\r\nor carts of any freeman for carriage, without the assent of the said\r\nfreeman.\r\n\r\n31. Neither shall we nor our bailiffs take any man's timber for our\r\ncastles or other uses, unless by the consent of the owner of the\r\ntimber.\r\n\r\n32. We will retain the lands of those convicted of felony only one\r\nyear and a day, and then they shall be delivered to the lord of the\r\nfee.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: All forfeiture for felony has been abolished by the 33\r\nand 34 Vic., c. 23. It seems to have originated in the destruction\r\nof the felon's property being part of the sentence, and this \"waste\"\r\nbeing commuted for temporary possession by the Crown.]\r\n\r\n\r\n33. All kydells[35] (wears) for the time to come shall be put down in\r\nthe rivers of Thames and Medway, and throughout all England, except\r\nupon the sea-coast.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: The purport of this was to prevent inclosures of common\r\nproperty, or committing a \"Purpresture.\" These wears are now called\r\n\"kettles\" or \"kettle-nets\" in Kent and Cornwall.]\r\n\r\n34. The writ which is called _præcipe_, for the future, shall not be\r\nmade out to any one, of any tenement, whereby a freeman may lose his\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\n35. There shall be one measure of wine and one of ale through our\r\nwhole realm; and one measure of corn, that is to say, the London\r\nquarter; and one breadth of dyed cloth, and russets, and haberjeets,\r\nthat is to say, two ells within the lists; and it shall be of weights\r\nas it is of measures.\r\n\r\n36. _Nothing from henceforth shall be given or taken for a writ of\r\ninquisition of life or limb, but it shall be granted freely, and not\r\ndenied._[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: This important writ, or \"writ concerning hatred and\r\nmalice,\" may have been the prototype of the writ of _habeas\r\ncorpus_, and was granted for a similar purpose.]\r\n\r\n37. If any do hold of us by fee-farm, or by socage, or by burgage, and\r\nhe hold also lands of any other by knight's service, we will not have\r\nthe custody of the heir or land, which is holden of another man's fee\r\nby reason of that fee-farm, socage,[37] or burgage; neither will we\r\nhave the custody of the fee-farm, or socage, or burgage, unless\r\nknight's service was due to us out of the same fee-farm. We will not\r\nhave the custody of an heir, nor of any land which he holds of another\r\nby knight's service, by reason of any petty serjeanty[38] by which he\r\nholds of us, by the service of paying a knife, an arrow, or the like.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: \"Socage\" signifies lands held by tenure of performing\r\ncertain inferior offices in husbandry, probably from the old French\r\nword _soc_, a plough-share.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: The tenure of giving the king some small weapon of war in\r\nacknowledgment of lands held.]\r\n\r\n38. No bailiff from henceforth shall pat any man to his law[39] upon\r\nhis own bare saying, without credible witnesses to prove it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Equivalent to putting him to his oath. This alludes to\r\nthe Wager of Law, by which a defendant and his eleven supporters or\r\n\"compurgators\" could swear to his non-liability, and this amounted to\r\na verdict in his favour.]\r\n\r\n39. _No freeman shall be taken or imprisoned, or disseised, or\r\noutlawed, or banished, or any ways destroyed, nor will we pass upon\r\nhim, nor will we send upon him, unless by the lawful judgment of his\r\npeers, or by the law of the land._\r\n\r\n40. _We will sell to no man, we will not deny to any man, either\r\njustice or right._\r\n\r\n41. All merchants shall have safe and secure conduct, to go out of,\r\nand to come into England, and to stay there and to pass as well by\r\nland as by water, for buying and selling by the ancient and allowed\r\ncustoms, without any unjust tolls; except in time of war, or when they\r\nare of any nation at war with us. And if there be found any such in\r\nour land, in the beginning of the war, they shall be attached, without\r\ndamage to their bodies or goods, until it be known unto us, or our\r\nchief justiciary, how our merchants be treated in the nation at war\r\nwith us; and if ours be safe there, the others shall be safe in our\r\ndominions.\r\n\r\n42. It shall be lawful, for the time to come, for any one to go out\r\nof our kingdom, and return safely and securely by land or by water,\r\nsaving his allegiance to us; unless in time of war, by some short\r\nspace, for the common benefit of the realm, except prisoners and\r\noutlaws, according to the law of the land, and people in war with us,\r\nand merchants who shall be treated as is above mentioned.[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: The Crown has still technically the power of confining\r\nsubjects within the kingdom by the writ \"ne exeat regno,\" though the\r\nuse of the writ is rarely resorted to.]\r\n\r\n43. If any man hold of any escheat,[41] as of the honour of\r\nWallingford, Nottingham, Boulogne, Lancaster, or of other escheats\r\nwhich be in our hands, and are baronies, and die, his heir shall give\r\nno other relief, and perform no other service to us than he would to\r\nthe baron, if it were in the baron's hand; and we will hold it after\r\nthe same manner as the baron held it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: The word _escheat_ is derived from the French\r\n_escheoir_, to return or happen, and signifies the return of\r\nan estate to a lord, either on failure of tenant's issue or on his\r\ncommitting felony. The abolition of feudal tenures by the Act of\r\nCharles II. (12 Charles II. c. 24) rendered obsolete this part and\r\nmany other parts of the Charter.]\r\n\r\n44. Those men who dwell without the forest from henceforth shall not\r\ncome before our justiciaries of the forest, upon common, summons, but\r\nsuch as are impleaded, or are sureties for any that are attached for\r\nsomething concerning the forest.[42]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 42: The laws for regulating the royal forests, and\r\nadministering justice in respect of offences committed in their\r\nprecincts, formed a large part of the law.]\r\n\r\n45. We will not make any justices, constables, sheriffs, or bailiffs,\r\nbut of such as know the law of the realm and mean duly to observe it.\r\n\r\n46. All barons who have founded abbeys, which they hold by charter\r\nfrom the kings of England, or by ancient tenure, shall have the\r\nkeeping of them, when vacant, as they ought to have.\r\n\r\n47. All forests that have been made forests in our time shall\r\nforthwith be disforested; and the same shall be done with the\r\nwater-banks that have been fenced in by us in our time.\r\n\r\n48. All evil customs concerning forests, warrens, foresters, and\r\nwarreners, sheriffs and their officers, water-banks and their keepers,\r\nshall forthwith be inquired into in each county, by twelve sworn\r\nknights of the same county, chosen by creditable persons of the same\r\ncounty; and within forty days after the said inquest be utterly\r\nabolished, so as never to be restored: so as we are first acquainted\r\ntherewith, or our justiciary, if we should not be in England.\r\n\r\n49. We will immediately give up all hostages and charters delivered\r\nunto us by our English subjects, as securities for their keeping the\r\npeace, and yielding us faithful service.\r\n\r\n50. We will entirely remove from their bailiwicks the relations of\r\nGerard de Atheyes, so that for the future they shall have no bailiwick\r\nin England; we will also remove Engelard de Cygony, Andrew, Peter, and\r\nGyon, from the Chancery; Gyon de Cygony, Geoffrey de Martyn, and his\r\nbrothers; Philip Mark, and his brothers, and his nephew, Geoffrey, and\r\ntheir whole retinue.\r\n\r\n51. As soon as peace is restored, we will send out of the kingdom all\r\nforeign knights, cross-bowmen, and stipendiaries, who are come with\r\nhorses and arms to the molestation of our people.\r\n\r\n52. If any one has been dispossessed or deprived by us, without the\r\nlawful judgment of his peers, of his lands, castles, liberties, or\r\nright, we will forthwith restore them to him; and if any dispute arise\r\nupon this head, let the matter be decided by the five-and-twenty\r\nbarons hereafter mentioned, for the preservation of the peace. And for\r\nall those things of which any person has, without the lawful judgment\r\nof his peers, been dispossessed or deprived, either by our father King\r\nHenry, or our brother King Richard, and which we have in our hands, or\r\nare possessed by others, and we are bound to warrant and make good,\r\nwe shall have a respite till the term usually allowed the crusaders;\r\nexcepting those things about which there is a plea depending, or\r\nwhereof an inquest hath been made, by our order before we undertook\r\nthe crusade; but as soon as we return from our expedition, or if\r\nperchance we tarry at home and do not make our expedition, we will\r\nimmediately cause full justice to be administered therein.\r\n\r\n53. The same respite we shall have, and in the same manner, about\r\nadministering justice, disafforesting or letting continue the forests,\r\nwhich Henry our father, and our brother Richard, have afforested; and\r\nthe same concerning the wardship of the lands which are in another's\r\nfee, but the wardship of which we have hitherto had, by reason of a\r\nfee held of us by knight's service; and for the abbeys founded in any\r\nother fee than our own, in which the lord of the fee says he has a\r\nright; and when we return from our expedition, or if we tarry at home,\r\nand do not make our expedition, we will immediately do full justice to\r\nall the complainants in this behalf.\r\n\r\n54. No man shall be taken or imprisoned upon the appeal[43] of a woman,\r\nfor the death of any other than her husband.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: An _Appeal_ here means an \"accusation.\" The appeal\r\nhere mentioned was a suit for a penalty in which the plaintiff was a\r\nrelation who had suffered through a murder or manslaughter. One of the\r\nincidents of this \"Appeal of Death\" was the Trial by Battle. These\r\nAppeals and Trial by Battle were not abolished before the passing of\r\nthe Act 59 Geo. III., c. 46.]\r\n\r\n55. All unjust and illegal fines made by us, and all amerciaments\r\nimposed unjustly and contrary to the law of the land, shall\r\nbe entirely given up, or else be left to the decision of the\r\nfive-and-twenty barons hereafter mentioned for the preservation of\r\nthe peace, or of the major part of them, together with the aforesaid\r\nStephen, Archbishop of Canterbury, if he can be present, and others\r\nwhom he shall think fit to invite; and if he cannot be present, the\r\nbusiness shall notwithstanding go on without him; but so that if one\r\nor more of the aforesaid five-and-twenty barons be plaintiffs in\r\nthe same cause, they shall be set aside as to what concerns this\r\nparticular affair, and others be chosen in their room, out of the said\r\nfive-and-twenty, and sworn by the rest to decide the matter.\r\n\r\n56. If we have disseised or dispossessed the Welsh of any lands,\r\nliberties, or other things, without the legal judgment of their peers,\r\neither in England or in Wales, they shall be immediately restored to\r\nthem; and if any dispute arise upon this head, the matter shall be\r\ndetermined in the Marches by the judgment of their peers; for tenements\r\nin England according to the law of England, for tenements in Wales\r\naccording to the law of Wales, for tenements of the Marches according to\r\nthe law of the Marches: the same shall the Welsh do to us and our\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n57. As for all those things of which a Welshman hath, without the lawful\r\njudgment of his peers, been disseised or deprived of by King Henry our\r\nfather, or our brother King Richard, and which we either have in our\r\nhands or others are possessed of, and we are obliged to warrant it, we\r\nshall have a respite till the time generally allowed the crusaders;\r\nexcepting those things about which a suit is depending, or whereof an\r\ninquest has been made by our order, before we undertook the crusade: but\r\nwhen we return, or if we stay at home without performing our expedition,\r\nwe will immediately do them full justice, according to the laws of the\r\nWelsh and of the parts before mentioned.\r\n\r\n58. We will without delay dismiss the son of Llewellin, and all the\r\n\r\nWelsh hostages, and release them from the engagements they have\r\nentered into with us for the preservation of the peace.\r\n\r\n59. We will treat with Alexander, King of Scots, concerning the\r\nrestoring his sisters and hostages, and his right and liberties, in\r\nthe same form and manner as we shall do to the rest of our barons\r\nof England; unless by the charters which we have from his father,\r\nWilliam, late King of Scots, it ought to be otherwise; and this shall\r\nbe left to the determination of his peers in our court.\r\n\r\n60. All the aforesaid customs and liberties, which we have granted to\r\nbe holden in our kingdom, as much as it belongs to us, all people of\r\nour kingdom, as well clergy as laity, shall observe, as far as they\r\nare concerned, towards their dependents.\r\n\r\n61. And whereas, for the honour of God and the amendment of our\r\nkingdom, and for the better quieting the discord that has arisen\r\nbetween us and our barons, we have granted all these things aforesaid;\r\nwilling to render them firm and lasting, we do give and grant our\r\nsubjects the underwritten security, namely that the barons may choose\r\nfive-and-twenty barons of the kingdom, whom they think convenient; who\r\nshall take care, with all their might, to hold and observe, and cause\r\nto be observed, the peace and liberties we have granted them, and by\r\nthis our present Charter confirmed in this manner; that is to say,\r\nthat if we, our justiciary, our bailiffs, or any of our officers,\r\nshall in any circumstance have failed in the performance of them\r\ntowards any person, or shall have broken through any of these articles\r\nof peace and security, and the offence be notified to four barons\r\nchosen out of the five-and-twenty before mentioned, the said four\r\nbarons shall repair to us, or our justiciary, if we are out of the\r\nrealm, and, laying open the grievance, shall petition to have it\r\nredressed without delay: and if it be not redressed by us, or if we\r\nshould chance to be out of the realm, if it should not be redressed by\r\nour justiciary within forty days, reckoning from the time it has been\r\nnotified to us, or to our justiciary (if we should be out of the\r\nrealm), the four barons aforesaid shall lay the cause before the rest\r\nof the five-and-twenty barons; and the said five-and-twenty barons,\r\ntogether with the community of the whole kingdom, shall distrain and\r\ndistress us in all the ways in which they shall be able, by seizing\r\nour castles, lands, possessions, and in any other manner they can,\r\ntill the grievance is redressed, according to their pleasure; saving\r\nharmless our own person, and the persons of our Queen and children;\r\nand when it is redressed, they shall behave to us as before. And any\r\nperson whatsoever in the kingdom may swear that he will obey the\r\norders of the five-and-twenty barons aforesaid in the execution of the\r\npremises, and will distress us, jointly with them, to the utmost of\r\nhis power; and we give public and free liberty to any one that shall\r\nplease to swear to this, and never will hinder any person from taking\r\nthe same oath.\r\n\r\n62. As for all those of our subjects who will not, of their own\r\naccord, swear to join the five-and-twenty barons in distraining and\r\ndistressing us, we will issue orders to make them take the same oath\r\nas aforesaid. And if any one of the five-and-twenty barons dies, or\r\ngoes out of the kingdom, or is hindered any other way from\r\ncarrying the things aforesaid into execution, the rest of the said\r\nfive-and-twenty barons may choose another in his room, at their\r\ndiscretion, who shall be sworn in like manner as the rest. In all\r\nthings that are committed to the execution of these five-and-twenty\r\nbarons, if, when they are all assembled together, they should happen\r\nto disagree about any matter, and some of them, when summoned, will\r\nnot or cannot come, whatever is agreed upon, or enjoined, by the major\r\npart of those that are present shall be reputed as firm and valid as\r\nif all the five-and-twenty had given their consent; and the aforesaid\r\nfive-and-twenty shall swear that all the premises they shall\r\nfaithfully observe, and cause with all their power to be observed. And\r\nwe will procure nothing from any one, by ourselves nor by another,\r\nwhereby any of these concessions and liberties may be revoked or\r\nlessened; and if any such thing shall have been obtained, let it be\r\nnull and void; neither will we ever make use of it either by ourselves\r\nor any other. And all the ill-will, indignations, and rancours that\r\nhave arisen between us and our subjects, of the clergy and laity, from\r\nthe first breaking out of the dissensions between us, we do fully\r\nremit and forgive: moreover, all trespasses occasioned by the said\r\ndissensions, from Easter in the sixteenth year of our reign till the\r\nrestoration of peace and tranquillity, we hereby entirely remit to\r\nall, both clergy and laity, and as far as in us lies do fully forgive.\r\nWe have, moreover, caused to be made for them the letters patent\r\ntestimonial of Stephen, Lord Archbishop of Canterbury, Henry, Lord\r\nArchbishop of Dublin, and the bishops aforesaid, as also of Master\r\nPandulph, for the security and concessions aforesaid.\r\n\r\n63. Wherefore we will and firmly enjoin, that the Church of England be\r\nfree, and that all men in our kingdom have and hold all the aforesaid\r\nliberties, rights, and concessions, truly and peaceably, freely and\r\nquietly, fully and wholly to themselves and their heirs, of us and our\r\nheirs, in all things and places, forever, as is aforesaid. It is also\r\nsworn, as well on our part as on the part of the barons, that all the\r\nthings aforesaid shall be observed in good faith, and without evil\r\nsubtilty. Given under our hand, in the presence of the witnesses above\r\nnamed, and many others, in the meadow called Runingmede, between\r\nWindsor and Staines, the 15th day of June, in the 17th year of our\r\nreign.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe translation here given is that published in Sheldon Amos's work\r\non _The English Constitution_. The translation given by Sir E.\r\nCreasy was chiefly followed in this, but it was collated with another\r\naccurate translation by Mr. Richard Thompson, accompanying his\r\n_Historical Essay on Magna Charta_, published in 1829, and also\r\nwith the Latin text. \"The explanation of the whole Charter,\" observes\r\nMr. Amos, must be sought chiefly in detailed accounts of the Feudal\r\nsystem in England, as explained in such works as those of Stubbs,\r\nHallam, and Blackstone. The scattered notes here introduced have\r\nonly for their purpose to elucidate the most unusual and perplexing\r\nexpressions. The Charter printed in the Statute Book is that issued\r\nin the ninth year of Henry III., which is also the one specially\r\nconfirmed by the Charter of Edward I. The Charter of Henry III.\r\ndiffers in some (generally) insignificant points from that of John.\r\nThe most important difference is the omission in the later Charter of\r\nthe 14th and 15th Articles of John's Charter, by which the King is\r\nrestricted from levying aids beyond the three ordinary ones, without\r\nthe assent of the 'Common Council of the Kingdom.' and provision is\r\nmade for summoning it. This passage is restored by Edward I. Magna\r\nCharter has been solemnly confirmed upwards of thirty times. See the\r\nchapter on the Great Charter, in Green's _History of the English\r\nPeople_. See also Stubbs's _Documents Illustrative of English\r\nHistory_. \"The whole of the constitutional history of England,\"\r\nsays Stubbs, \"is a commentary on this Charter, the illustration of\r\nwhich must be looked for in the documents that precede and follow.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"CONFIRMATIO CHARTARUM\" OF EDWARD I.\r\n\r\n1297.\r\n\r\nI. Edward, by the grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, and\r\nDuke Guyan, to all those that these present letters shall hear or see,\r\ngreeting. Know ye that we, to the honour of God and of holy Church,\r\nand to the profit of our realm, have granted for us and our heirs,\r\nthat the Charter of Liberties and the Charter of the Forest, which\r\nwere made by common assent of all the realm in the time of King Henry\r\nour father, shall be kept in every point without breach. And we will\r\nthat the same Charters shall be sent under our seal as well to our\r\njustices of the forest as to others, and to all sheriffs of shires,\r\nand to all our other officers, and to all our cities throughout the\r\nrealm, together with our writs in the which it shall be contained that\r\nthey cause the foresaid Charters to be published, and to declare to\r\nthe people that we have confirmed them in all points; and that our\r\njustices, sheriffs, mayors, and other ministers, which under us have\r\nthe laws of our land to guide, shall allow the said Charters pleaded\r\nbefore them in judgment in all their points; that is to wit, the Great\r\nCharter as the common law, and the Charter of the Forest according to\r\nthe assize of the Forest, for the wealth of our realm.\r\n\r\nII. And we will that if any judgment be given from henceforth,\r\ncontrary to the points of the Charters aforesaid, by the justices or\r\nby any other our ministers that hold plea before them against the\r\npoints of the Charters, it shall be undone and holden for naught.\r\n\r\nIII. And we will that the same Charters shall be sent under our seal\r\nto cathedral churches throughout our realm, there to remain, and shall\r\nbe read before the people two times by the year. IV. And that all\r\narchbishops and bishops shall pronounce the sentence of great\r\nexcommunication against all those that by word, deed, or counsel do\r\ncontrary to the foresaid Charters, or that in any point break or undo\r\nthem. And that the said curses be twice a year denounced and published\r\nby the prelates aforesaid. And if the prelates or any of them be\r\nremiss in the denunciation of the said sentences, the Archbishops of\r\nCanterbury and York for the time being, as is fitting, shall compel\r\nand distrain them to make that denunciation in form aforesaid.\r\n\r\nV. And for so much as divers people of our realm are in fear that the\r\naids and tasks which they have given to us beforetime towards our wars\r\nand other business, of their own grant and goodwill, howsoever they\r\nwere made, might turn to a bondage to them and their heirs, because\r\nthey might be at another time found in the rolls, and so likewise the\r\nprises taken throughout the realm by our ministers; we have granted\r\nfor us and our heirs, that we shall not draw such aids, tasks, nor\r\nprises into a custom, for anything that hath been done heretofore, or\r\nthat may be found by roll or in any other manner.\r\n\r\nVI. Moreover we have granted for us and our heirs, as well to\r\narchbishops, bishops, abbots, priors, and other folk of holy Church,\r\nas also to earls, barons, and to all the commonalty of the land, that\r\nfor no business from henceforth will we take such manner of aids,\r\ntasks, nor prises but by the common consent of the realm, and for the\r\ncommon profit thereof, saving the ancient aids and prises due and\r\naccustomed.\r\n\r\nVII. And for so much as the more part of the commonalty of the realm\r\nfind themselves sore grieved with the matelote of wools, that is to\r\nwit, a toll of forty shillings for every sack of wool, and have made\r\npetition to us to release the same; we, at their requests, have\r\nclearly released it, and have granted for us and our heirs that we\r\nshall not take such thing nor any other without their common assent\r\nand goodwill; saving to us and our heirs the custom of wools, skins,\r\nand leather, granted before by the commonalty aforesaid. In witness\r\nof which things we have caused these our letters to be made patents.\r\nWitness Edward our son, at London, the 10th day of October, the\r\nfive-and-twentieth of our reign.\r\n\r\nAnd be it remembered that this same Charter, in the same terms, word\r\nfor word, was sealed in Flanders under the King's Great Seal, that is\r\nto say, at Ghent, the 5th day of November, in the 52th year of the\r\nreign of our aforesaid Lord the King, and sent into England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe words of this important document, from Professor Stubbs's\r\ntranslation, are given as the best explanation of the constitutional\r\nposition and importance of the Charters of John and Henry III. See\r\nhistorical notice in Stubbs's _Documents Illustrative of English\r\nHistory_, p. 477. This is far the most important of the numerous\r\nratifications of the Great Charter. Hallam calls it \"that famous\r\nstatute, inadequately denominated the Confirmation of the Charters,\r\nbecause it added another pillar to our constitution, not less important\r\nthan the Great Charter itself.\" It solemnly confirmed the two Charters,\r\nthe Charter of the Forest (issued by Henry II. in 1217--see text in\r\nStubbs, p. 338) being then considered as of equal importance with Magna\r\nCharta itself, establishing them in all points as the law of the land;\r\nbut it did more. \"Hitherto the king's prerogative of levying money by\r\nname of _tallage_ or _prise_, from his towns and tenants in\r\ndemesne, had passed unquestioned. Some impositions, that especially on\r\nthe export of wool, affected all the king's subjects. It was now the\r\nmoment to enfranchise the people and give that security to private\r\nproperty which Magna Charta had given to personal liberty.\" Edward's\r\nstatute binds the king never to take any of these \"aids, tasks, and\r\nprises\" in future, save by the common assent of the realm. Hence, as\r\nBowen remarks, the Confirmation of the Charters, or an abstract of it\r\nunder the form of a supposed statute _de tallagio non concedendo_\r\n(see Stubbs, p. 487), was more frequently cited than any other enactment\r\nby the parliamentary leaders who resisted the encroachments of Charles I.\r\nThe original of the _Confirmatio Chartarum_, which is in Norman French,\r\nis still in existence, though considerably shriveled by the fire which\r\ndamaged so many of the Cottonian manuscripts in 1731.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRANT OF THE GREAT CHARTER.\r\n\r\nAn island in the Thames between Staines and Windsor had been chosen as\r\nthe place of conference: the King encamped on one bank, while the\r\nbarons--covered the marshy flat, still known by the name of Runnymede,\r\non the other. Their delegates met in the island between them, but the\r\nnegotiations were a mere cloak to cover John's purpose of unconditional\r\nsubmission. The Great Charter was discussed, agreed to, and signed in a\r\nsingle day. One copy of it still remains in the British Museum, injured\r\nby age and fire, but with the royal seal still hanging from the brown,\r\nshrivelled parchment. It is impossible to gaze without reverence on the\r\nearliest monument of English freedom which we can see with our own eyes\r\nand touch with our own hands, the great Charter to which from age to age\r\npatriots have looked back as the basis of English liberty. But in itself\r\nthe Charter was no novelty, nor did it claim to establish any new\r\nconstitutional principles. The Charter of Henry the First formed the\r\nbasis of the whole, and the additions to it are for the most part formal\r\nrecognitions of the judicial and administrative changes introduced by\r\nHenry the Second. But the vague expressions of the older charters were\r\nnow exchanged for precise and elaborate provisions. The bonds of\r\nunwritten custom which the older grants did little more than recognize\r\nhad proved too weak to hold the Angevins; and the baronage now threw\r\nthem aside for the restraints of written law. It is in this way that the\r\nGreat Charter marks the transition from the age of traditional rights,\r\npreserved in the nation's memory and officially declared by the Primate,\r\nto the age of written legislation, of Parliaments and Statutes, which\r\nwas soon to come. The Church had shown its power of self-defence in the\r\nstruggle over the interdict, and the clause which recognized its rights\r\nalone retained the older and general form. But all vagueness ceases when\r\nthe Charter passes on to deal with the rights of Englishmen at large,\r\ntheir right to justice, to _security of person and property, to good\r\ngovernment_. 'No freeman,' ran the memorable article that lies at the\r\nbase of our whole judicial system, 'shall be seized or imprisoned, or\r\ndispossessed, or outlawed, or in any way brought to ruin; we will not go\r\nagainst any man nor send against him, save by legal judgment of his\r\npeers or by the law of the land.' 'To no man will we sell,' runs\r\nanother, 'or deny, or delay, right or justice.' The great reforms of the\r\npast reigns were now formally recognized; judges of assize were to hold\r\ntheir circuits four times in the year, and the Court of Common Pleas was\r\nno longer to follow the King in his wanderings over the realm, but to\r\nsit in a fixed place. But the denial of justice under John was a small\r\ndanger compared with the lawless exactions both of himself and his\r\npredecessor. Richard had increased the amount of the scutage which Henry\r\nII. had introduced, and applied it to raise funds for his ransom. He had\r\nrestored the Danegeld, or land tax, so often abolished, under the new\r\nname of 'carucage,' had seized the wool of the Cistercians and the plate\r\nof the churches, and rated movables as well as land. John had again\r\nraised the rate of scutage, and imposed aids, fines, and ransoms at his\r\npleasure without counsel of the baronage. The Great Charter met this\r\nabuse by the provision on which our constitutional system rests. With\r\nthe exception of the three customary feudal aids which still remained to\r\nthe crown, 'no scutage or aid shall be imposed in our realm save by the\r\nCommon Council of the realm;' and to this Great Council it was provided\r\nthat prelates and the greater barons should be summoned by special writ,\r\nand all tenants in chief through the sheriffs and bailiffs, at least\r\nforty days before. But it was less easy to provide means for the control\r\nof a King whom no man could trust, and a council of twenty-four barons\r\nwas chosen from the general body of their order to enforce on John the\r\nobservance of the Charter, with the right of declaring war on the King\r\nshould its provisions be infringed. Finally, the Charter was published\r\nthroughout the whole country, and sworn to at every hundred-mote and\r\ntown-mote by order from the King.--_Green's Short History of the English\r\nPeople_, p. 123.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PART OF THE BILL OF RIGHTS.\r\n\r\nAN ACT FOR DECLARING THE RIGHTS AND LIBERTIES OF THE SUBJECT, AND\r\nSETTLING THE SUCCESSION OF THE CROWN. 1689.\r\n\r\nWhereas the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, assembled at\r\nWestminster, lawfully, fully, and freely representing all the estates of\r\nthe people of this realm, did upon the thirteenth day of February, in\r\nthe year of our Lord one thousand six hundred eighty-eight [o.s.],[44]\r\npresent unto their Majesties, then called and known by the names and\r\nstyle of William and Mary, Prince and Princess of Orange, being present\r\nin their proper persons, a certain Declaration in writing, made by the\r\nsaid Lords and Commons, in the words following, viz.:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: In New Style Feb. 23, 1689.]\r\n\r\nWhereas the late King James II., by the assistance of divers evil\r\ncounsellors, judges, and ministers employed by him, did endeavour\r\nto subvert and extirpate the Protestant religion, and the laws and\r\nliberties of this kingdom:\r\n\r\n1. By assuming and exercising a power of dispensing with and\r\nsuspending of laws, and the execution of laws, without consent of\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n2. By committing and prosecuting divers worthy prelates for humbly\r\npetitioning to be excused from concurring to the said assumed power.\r\n\r\n3. By issuing and causing to be executed a commission under the Great\r\nSeal for erecting a court, called the Court of Commissioners for\r\nEcclesiastical Causes.\r\n\r\n4. By levying money for and to the use of the Crown by pretence of\r\nprerogative, for other time and in other manner than the same was\r\ngranted by Parliament.\r\n\r\n5. By raising and keeping a\r\nstanding army within this kingdom in time of peace, without consent of\r\nParliament, and quartering soldiers contrary to law.\r\n\r\n6. By causing several good subjects, being Protestants, to be\r\ndisarmed, at the same time when Papists were both armed and employed\r\ncontrary to law.\r\n\r\n7. By violating the freedom of election of members to serve in\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n8. By prosecutions in the Court of King's Bench for matters and causes\r\ncognizable only in Parliament, and by divers other arbitrary and\r\nillegal causes.\r\n\r\n9. And whereas of late years, partial, corrupt, and unqualified\r\npersons have been returned, and served on juries in trials, and\r\nparticularly divers jurors in trials for high treason, which were not\r\nfreeholders.\r\n\r\n10. And excessive bail hath been required of persons committed in\r\ncriminal cases, to elude the benefit of the laws made for the liberty\r\nof the subjects.\r\n\r\n11. And excessive fines have been imposed; and illegal and cruel\r\npunishments inflicted.\r\n\r\n12. And several grants and promises made of fines and forfeitures\r\nbefore any conviction or judgment against the persons upon whom the\r\nsame were to be levied.\r\n\r\nAll which are utterly and directly contrary to the known laws and\r\nstatutes, and freedom of this realm.\r\n\r\nAnd whereas the said late King James II. having abdicated the\r\ngovernment, and the throne being thereby vacant, his Highness the Prince\r\nof Orange (whom it hath pleased Almighty God to make the glorious\r\ninstrument of delivering this kingdom from popery and arbitrary power)\r\ndid (by the advice of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and divers\r\nprincipal persons of the Commons) cause letters to be written to the\r\nLords Spiritual and Temporal, being Protestants, and other letters to\r\nthe several counties, cities, universities, boroughs, and cinque ports,\r\nfor the choosing of such persons to represent them as were of right to\r\nbe sent to Parliament, to meet and sit at Westminster upon the\r\ntwo-and-twentieth day of January, in this year one thousand six hundred\r\neighty and eight,[45] in order to such an establishment, as that their\r\nreligion, laws, and liberties might not again be in danger of being\r\nsubverted; upon which letters elections have been accordingly made.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: In New Style Feb. 1, 1689.]\r\n\r\nAnd thereupon the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons,\r\npursuant to their respective letters and elections, being now\r\nassembled in a full and free representation of this nation, taking\r\ninto their most serious consideration the best means for attaining the\r\nends aforesaid, do in the first place (as their ancestors in like case\r\nhave usually done) for the vindicating and asserting their ancient\r\nrights and liberties, declare:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. That the pretended power of suspending of laws, or the execution of\r\nlaws by regal authority, without consent of Parliament, is illegal.\r\n\r\n2. That the pretended power of dispensing with laws, or the execution\r\nof laws by regal authority, as it hath been assumed and exercised of\r\nlate, is illegal.\r\n\r\n3. That the commission for erecting the late Court of Commissioners\r\nfor Ecclesiastical Causes, and all other commissions and courts of\r\nlike nature, are illegal and pernicious.\r\n\r\n4. _That levying money for or to the use of the Crown by pretence\r\nand prerogative, without grant of Parliament, for longer time or in\r\nother manner than the same is or shall be granted, is illegal._[46]\r\n\r\n5. _That it is the right of the subjects to petition the King,\r\nand all commitments and prosecutions for such petitioning are\r\nillegal._[47]\r\n\r\n6. _That the raising or keeping a standing army within the kingdom\r\nin time of peace, unless it be with consent of Parliament, is against\r\nlaw._[48]\r\n\r\n7. _That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their\r\ndefence suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law._[49]\r\n\r\n8. That election of members of Parliament ought to be free.\r\n\r\n9. _That the freedom of speech, and debates or proceedings in\r\nParliament, ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or\r\nplace out of Parliament._[50]\r\n\r\n10. _That excessive bail ought not to be required, nor excessive\r\nfines imposed; nor cruel and unusual punishments inflicted._[51]\r\n\r\n11. _That jurors ought to be duly impanelled and returned, and\r\njurors which pass upon men in trials for high treason ought to be\r\nfreeholders._[52]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: Compare this clause 4 with clauses 12 and 14 of Magna\r\nCharta, and with Art.

That all grants and promises of fines and forfeitures of\r\nparticular persons before conviction are illegal and void.\r\n\r\n13. And that for redress of all grievances, and for the amending,\r\nstrengthening, and preserving of the laws, Parliament ought to be held\r\nfrequently.\r\n\r\nAnd they do claim, demand, and insist upon all and singular the\r\npremises, as their undoubted rights and liberties; and that no\r\ndeclarations, judgments, doings or proceedings, to the prejudice of\r\nthe people in any of the said premises, ought in any wise to be drawn\r\nhereafter into consequence or example.\r\n\r\nTo which demand of their rights they are particularly encouraged by\r\nthe declaration of his Highness the Prince of Orange, as being the\r\nonly means for obtaining a full redress and remedy therein.\r\n\r\nHaving therefore an entire confidence that his said Highness the\r\nPrince of Orange will perfect the deliverance so far advanced by him,\r\nand will still preserve them from the violation of their rights,\r\nwhich they have here asserted, and from all other attempts upon their\r\nreligion, rights, and liberties:\r\n\r\nII. The said Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, assembled at\r\nWestminster, do resolve, that William and Mary, Prince and Princess of\r\nOrange, be, and be declared, King and Queen of England, France, and\r\nIreland, and the dominions thereunto belonging, to hold the crown and\r\nroyal dignity of the said kingdoms and dominions to them the said Prince\r\nand Princess during their lives, and the life of the survivor of them;\r\nand that the sole and full exercise of the regal power be only in, and\r\nexecuted by, the said Prince of Orange, in the names of the said Prince\r\nand Princess, during their joint lives; and after their deceases, the\r\nsaid crown and royal dignity of the said kingdoms and dominions to be to\r\nthe heirs of the body of the said Princess; and for default of such\r\nissue to the Princess Anne of Denmark, and the heirs of her body; and\r\nfor default of such issue to the heirs of the body of the said Prince of\r\nOrange. And the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Commons, do pray the\r\nsaid Prince and Princess to accept the same accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe act goes on to declare that, their Majesties having accepted the\r\ncrown upon these terms, the rights and liberties asserted and claimed\r\nin the said declaration are the true, ancient, and indubitable rights\r\nand liberties of the people of this kingdom, and so shall be esteemed,\r\nallowed, adjudged, deemed, and taken to be, and that all and every\r\nthe particulars aforesaid shall be firmly and strictly holden and\r\nobserved, as they are expressed in the said declaration; and all\r\nofficers and ministers whatsoever shall serve their Majesties and\r\ntheir successors according to the same in all times to come.\r\n\r\nThe act then declares that William and Mary are and of right ought\r\nto be King and Queen of England, etc.; and it goes on to regulate the\r\nsuccession after their deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe passing of the Bill of Rights in 1689 restored to the monarchy\r\nthe character which it had lost under the Tudors and the Stuarts. The\r\nright of the people through its representatives to depose the King,\r\nto change the order of succession, and to set on the throne whom they\r\nwould, was now established. All claim of divine right, or hereditary\r\nright independent of the law, was formally put an end to by the\r\nelection of William and Mary. Since their day no English sovereign has\r\nbeen able to advance any claim to the crown save a claim which rested\r\non a particular clause in a particular Act of Parliament. William,\r\nMary, and Anne were sovereigns simply by virtue of the Bill of Rights.\r\nGeorge the First and his successors have been sovereigns solely by\r\nvirtue of the Act of Settlement. An English monarch is now as much the\r\ncreature of an Act of Parliament as the pettiest tax-gatherer in his\r\nrealm.--_Green's Short History_, p. 673.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FUNDAMENTAL ORDERS OF CONNECTICUT.\r\n\r\n1638(9).\r\n\r\n_The first written constitution that created a government._\r\n\r\nForasmuch as it hath pleased the Allmighty God by the wise disposition\r\nof his diuyne pruidence so to Order and dispose of things that we the\r\nInhabitants and Residents of Windsor, Harteford and Wethersfield are\r\nnow cohabiting and dwelling in and vppon the River of Conectecotte and\r\nthe Lands thereunto adioyneing; And well knowing where a people are\r\ngathered togather the word of God requires that to mayntayne the peace\r\nand vnion of such a people there should be an orderly and decent\r\nGouerment established according to God, to order and dispose of the\r\naffayres of the people at all seasons as occation shall require; doe\r\ntherefore assotiate and conioyne our selues to be as one Publike State\r\nor Comonwelth; and doe, for our selues and our Successors and such as\r\nshall be adioyned to vs att any tyme hereafter, enter into Combination\r\nand Confederation togather, to mayntayne and p'rsearue the liberty and\r\npurity of the gospell of our Lord Jesus w'ch we now p'rfesse, as also\r\nthe disciplyne of the Churches, w'ch according to the truth of the\r\nsaid gospell is now practised amongst vs; As also in o'r Ciuell\r\nAffaires to be guided and gouerned according to such Lawes,\r\nRules, Orders and decrees as shall be made, ordered & decreed, as\r\nfolloweth:--\r\n\r\n1.

It elevates party above country; it forgets the common\r\nweal in the pursuit of personal emolument; it tends to form, it does\r\nform, we see that it has formed, a political combination, united by\r\nno common principles or opinions among its members, either upon the\r\npowers of the Government or the true policy of the country, but held\r\ntogether simply as an association, under the charm of a popular\r\nhead, seeking to maintain possession of the Government by a vigorous\r\nexercise of its patronage, and for this purpose agitating and alarming\r\nand distressing social life by the exercise of a tyrannical party\r\nproscription. Sir, if this course of things cannot be checked, good\r\nmen will grow tired of the exercise of political privileges. They will\r\nsee that such elections are but a mere selfish contest for office,\r\nand they will abandon the Government to the scramble of the bold, the\r\ndaring, and the desperate.\"--_Daniel Webster on Civil Service, in\r\n1832_.\r\n\r\n_Question 4._ Correct any errors in spelling which you find in\r\nthe following sentences, writing your letters so plainly that no one\r\nof them can be mistaken:\r\n\r\nUnquestionebly every federil offeser should be able to spell corectly\r\nthe familier words of his own languege.\r\n\r\nLose her hankercheif and elivate her head immediatly or she will\r\nspedily loose her life by strangelation.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND SUBJECT.\r\n\r\n_Question 1._ Multiply 2341705 by 23870 and divide the product by\r\n6789.\r\n\r\n_Give operation in full._\r\n\r\n_Question 2._ Divide two hundred and five thousand two hundred\r\nand five, and two hundred and five ten-thousandths, by one hundred\r\nthousand one hundred, and one hundredth.\r\n\r\n_Question 3._ Multiply 10-2/3 by 7-1/8 and divide the product by\r\n9-1/2, reducing the same to the simplest form.\r\n\r\n_Give operation in full._\r\n\r\n_Question 4._ The annual cost of the public schools of a city\r\nis $36,848.

No other method of marking, such as erasing\r\nnames, will answer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, if you wished to vote for John Bowles for Governor, you would\r\nmark your ballot in this way:--\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR                           Vote for ONE\r\nJOHN BOWLES, of Taunton             Prohibition.   X\r\nTHOMAS E. MEANS, of Boston          Democratic.\r\nELIJAH SMITH, of Pittsfield         Republican.\r\n\r\nIf you wish to vote for a person whose name is not on the ballot,\r\nwrite, or insert by a sticker, the name in the blank line at the end\r\nof the list of candidates for the office, and mark a cross X in the\r\nsquare at the right of it. Thus, if you wished to vote for George T.\r\nMorton, of Chelsea, for Governor, you would prepare your ballot in\r\nthis way:--\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR                           Vote for ONE\r\nJOHN BOWLES, of Taunton             Prohibition.\r\nTHOMAS E. MEANS, of Boston          Democratic.\r\nELIJAH SMITH, of Pittsfield         Republican.\r\n_George T. Morton, of Chelsea_                     X\r\n\r\nNotice, that for some offices you may vote for \"two\" or \"three\"\r\ncandidates, as stated in the ballot at the right of the name of the\r\noffice to be voted for, e.g.: \"COMMISSIONERS OF INSOLVENCY. Vote for\r\nTHREE.\"\r\n\r\nIf you spoil a ballot, return it to the ballot clerk, who will give\r\nyou another. You cannot have more than two extra ballots, or three in\r\nall. You cannot remain within the rail more than ten minutes, and in\r\ncase all the shelves are in use and other voters waiting, you are\r\nallowed only five minutes at the voting shelf.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the voting shelf, fold your ballot in the same way as\r\nit was folded when you received it, and keep it so folded until you\r\nplace it in the ballot box.\r\n\r\nDo not show any one how you have marked your ballot.\r\n\r\nGo to the ballot box and give your name and residence to the officer\r\nin charge.\r\n\r\nPut your folded ballot in the box with the certificate of the\r\nSecretary of the Commonwealth uppermost and in sight.\r\n\r\nYou are not allowed to carry away a ballot, whether spoiled or not.\r\n\r\nA voter who declares to the presiding official (under oath, if\r\nrequired) that he was a voter before May 1, 1857, and cannot read, or\r\nthat he is blind or physically unable to mark his ballot, can receive\r\nthe assistance of one or two of the election officers in the marking\r\nof his ballot.",
