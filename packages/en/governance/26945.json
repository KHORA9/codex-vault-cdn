B. LIPPINCOTT & CO., in the Office of the\r\n  Librarian of Congress, at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDANUBIAN DAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COSTUMES AT PESTH.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it were not for the people, the journey by steamer from Belgrade to\r\nPesth would be rather unromantic. When the Servian capital is reached in\r\nascending the great stream from Galatz and Rustchuk, the picturesque\r\ncliffs, the mighty forests, the moss-grown ruins overhanging the\r\nrushing waters, are all left behind. Belgrade is not very imposing. It\r\nlies along a low line of hills bordering the Sava and the Danube, and\r\ncontains only a few edifices which are worthy even of the epithet\r\ncreditable. The white pinnacle from which it takes its name--for the\r\ncity grouped around the fort was once called _Beograd_ (\"white\r\ncity\")--now looks grimy and gloomy. The Servians have placed the cannon\r\nwhich they took from the Turks in the recent war on the ramparts, and\r\nhave become so extravagantly vain in view of their exploits that their\r\nconceit is quite painful to contemplate. Yet it is impossible to avoid\r\nsympathizing to some extent with this little people, whose lot has been\r\nso hard and whose final emancipation has been so long in arriving. The\r\nintense affection which the Servian manifests for his native land is\r\ndoubtless the result of the struggles and the sacrifices which he has\r\nbeen compelled to make in order to remain in possession of it. One day\r\nhe has been threatened by the Austrian or the jealous and unreasonable\r\nHungarian: another he has received news that the Turks were marching\r\nacross his borders, burning, plundering and devastating. There is\r\nsomething peculiarly pathetic in the lot of these small Danubian states.\r\nNearly every one of them has been the cause of combats in which its\r\ninhabitants have shed rivers of blood before they could obtain even a\r\nfragment of such liberty and peace as have long been the possessions of\r\nSwitzerland and Belgium. It is not surprising that the small countries\r\nwhich once formed part of Turkey-in-Europe are anxious to grow larger\r\nand stronger by annexation of territory and consolidation of\r\npopulations. They are tired of being feeble: it is not amusing. Servia\r\nonce expected that she would be allowed to gain a considerable portion\r\nof Bosnia, her neighbor province, but the Austrians are there, and would\r\nspeedily send forces to Belgrade if it were for a moment imagined that\r\nPrince Milan and his counsellors were still greedy for Serapevo and\r\nother fat towns of the beautiful Bosnian lands. Now and then, when a\r\nServian burgher has had an extra flask of Negotin, he vapors about\r\nmeeting the Austrians face to face and driving them into the Sava; but\r\nhe never mentions it when he is in a normal condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOPHIA.]\r\n\r\nThe country which Servia has won from the Turks in the neighborhood of\r\nNisch, and the quaint old city of Nisch itself, were no meagre prizes,\r\nand ought to content the ambition of the young prince for some time. It\r\nwas righteous that the Servians should possess Nisch, and that the Turks\r\nshould be driven out by violence. The cruel and vindictive barbarian had\r\ndone everything that he could to make himself feared and loathed by the\r\nServians. To this day, not far from one of the principal gates of the\r\ncity, on the Pirot road, stands the \"Skull Tower,\" in the existence of\r\nwhich, I suppose, an English Tory would refuse to believe, just as he\r\ndenied his credence to the story of the atrocities at Batak. The four\r\nsides of this tower are completely covered, as with a barbarous mosaic,\r\nwith the skulls of Servians slain by their oppressors in the great\r\ncombat of 1809. The Turks placed here but a few of their trophies, for\r\nthey slaughtered thousands, while the tower's sides could accommodate\r\nonly nine hundred and fifty-two skulls. It is much to the credit of the\r\nServians that when they took Nisch in 1877 they wreaked no vengeance on\r\nthe Mussulman population, but simply compelled them to give up their\r\narms, and informed them that they could return to their labors. The\r\npresence of the Servians at Nisch has already been productive of good:\r\ndecent roads from that point to Sophia are already in process of\r\nconstruction, and the innumerable brigands who swarmed along the\r\ncountry-side have been banished or killed. Sophia still lies basking in\r\nthe mellow sunlight, lazily refusing to be cleansed or improved. Nowhere\r\nelse on the border-line of the Orient is there a town which so admirably\r\nillustrates the reckless and stupid negligence of the Turk. Sophia looks\r\nenchanting from a distance, but when one enters its narrow streets,\r\nchoked with rubbish and filled with fetid smells, one is only too glad\r\nto retire hastily. It would take a quarter of a century to make Sophia\r\nclean. All round the city are scattered ancient tumuli filled with the\r\nremains of the former lords of the soil, and they are almost as\r\nattractive as the hovels in which live the people of to-day. What a\r\ndesolate waste the Turk has been allowed to make of one of the finest\r\ncountries in Europe! He must be thrust out before improvement can come\r\nin. Lamartine, who was one of the keenest observers that ever set foot\r\nin Turkey, truly said \"that civilization, which is so fine in its proper\r\nplace, would prove a mortal poison to Islamism. Civilization cannot live\r\nwhere the Turks are: it will wither away and perish more quickly\r\nwhenever it is brought near them. With it, if you could acclimate it in\r\nTurkey, you could not make Europeans, you could not make Christians: you\r\nwould simply unmake Turks.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANKS OF THE DANUBE NEAR SEMLIN.]\r\n\r\nThe enemies of progress and of the \"Christian dogs\" are receding, and\r\nrailways and sanitary improvements will come when they are gone.\r\nBelgrade was a wretched town when the Turks had it: now it is civilized.\r\nIts history is romantic and picturesque, although its buildings are not.\r\nServia's legends and the actual recitals of the adventurous wars which\r\nhave occurred within her limits would fill volumes. The White City has\r\nbeen famous ever since the Ottoman conquest. Its dominant position at\r\nthe junction of two great rivers, at the frontier of Christian Europe,\r\nat a time when turbans were now and then seen in front of the walls of\r\nVienna, gave it a supreme importance. The Turks exultingly named it \"the\r\nGate of the Holy War.\" Thence it was that they sallied forth on\r\nincursions through the fertile plains where now the Hungarian shepherd\r\nleads his flock and plays upon his wooden pipe, undisturbed by the\r\nbearded infidel. The citadel was fought over until its walls cracked\r\nbeneath the successive blows of Christian and Mussulman. Suleiman the\r\nLawgiver, the elector of Bavaria, Eugene of Savoy, have trod the\r\nramparts which frown on the Danube's broad current. The Austrians have\r\nmany memories of the old fortress: they received it in 1718 by the\r\ntreaty of Passarowitz, but gave it up in 1749, to take it back again in\r\n1789. The treaty of Sistova--an infamy which postponed the liberation\r\nof the suffering peoples in Turkey-in-Europe for nearly a hundred\r\nyears--compelled the Austrians once more to yield it, this time to the\r\nTurks. In this century how often has it been fought over--from the time\r\nof the heroic Kara George, the Servian liberator, to the bloody riots in\r\nour days which resulted in driving Mussulmans definitely from the\r\nterritory!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VILLAGE NEAR SEMLIN.]\r\n\r\nEverywhere along the upper Servian banks of the Danube traces of the old\r\nepoch are disappearing. The national costume, which was graceful, and\r\noften very rich, is yielding before the prosaic--the ugly garments\r\nimported from Jewish tailoring establishments in Vienna and Pesth. The\r\nhorseman with his sack-coat, baggy velvet trousers and slouch hat looks\r\nnot unlike a rough rider along the shores of the Mississippi River. In\r\nthe interior patriarchal costumes and customs are still preserved. On\r\nthe Sava river-steamers the people from towns in the shadows of the\r\nprimeval forests which still cover a large portion of the country are to\r\nbe found, and they are good studies for an artist. The women, with\r\ngolden ducats braided in their hair; the priests, with tall brimless\r\nhats and long yellow robes; the men, with round skull-caps, leathern\r\ngirdles with knives in them, and waistcoats ornamented with hundreds of\r\nglittering buttons,--are all unconscious of the change which is creeping\r\nin by the Danube, and to which they will presently find themselves\r\nsubmitting. The railway will take away the lingering bits of romance\r\nfrom Servia; the lovely and lonely monasteries high among the grand\r\npeaks in the mountain-ranges will be visited by tourists from Paris, who\r\nwill scrawl their names upon the very altars; and Belgrade will be rich\r\nin second-class caravanserais kept by Moses and Abraham. After the\r\nAustrians who have gone over into Bosnia will naturally follow a crowd\r\nof adventurers from Croatia and from the neighborhood of Pesth, and it\r\nwould not be surprising should many of them find it for their interest\r\nto settle in Servia, although the government would probably endeavor to\r\nkeep them out. Should the movement which Lord Beaconsfield is pleased to\r\ncall the \"Panslavic conspiracy\" assume alarming proportions within a\r\nshort time, the Servians would be in great danger of losing, for years\r\nat least, their autonomy.\r\n\r\nThe arrival by night at Belgrade, coming from below, is interesting, and\r\none has a vivid recollection ever afterward of swarms of barefooted\r\ncoal-heavers, clad in coarse sacking, rushing tumultuously up and down a\r\ngang-plank, as negroes do when wooding up on a Southern river; of\r\nshouting and swaggering Austrian customs officials, clad in gorgeous\r\nraiment, but smoking cheap cigars; of Servian gendarmes emulating the\r\nbluster and surpassing the rudeness of the Austrians; of Turks in\r\ntransit from the Constantinople boat to the craft plying to Bosnian\r\nriver-ports; of Hungarian peasants in white felt jackets embroidered\r\nwith scarlet thread, or mayhap even with yellow; and of various Bohemian\r\nbeggars, whose swart faces remind one that he is still in the\r\nneighborhood of the East. I had on one occasion, while a steamer was\r\nlying at Belgrade, time to observe the manners of the humbler sort of\r\nfolk in a species of cabaret near the river-side and hard by the erratic\r\nstructure known as the custom-house. There was a serious air upon the\r\nfaces of the men which spoke well for their characters. Each one seemed\r\nindependent, and to a certain extent careless, of his neighbor's\r\nopinion. It would have been impossible, without some knowledge of the\r\nhistory of the country, to have supposed that these people, or even\r\ntheir ancestors, had ever been oppressed. Gayety did not prevail, nor is\r\nthere anywhere among the Danubian Slavs a tendency to the innocent and\r\nspontaneous jollity so common in some sections of Europe. The Servian\r\ntakes life seriously. I was amused to see that each one of this numerous\r\ncompany of swineherds or farmers, who had evidently come in to Belgrade\r\nto market, drank his wine as if it were a duty, and on leaving saluted\r\nas seriously as if he were greeting a distinguished company gathered to\r\ndo him honor. That such men are cowards, as the English would have us\r\nbelieve, is impossible; and in 1877 they showed that the slander was\r\ndestitute of even the slightest foundation in fact.\r\n\r\nMorals in Belgrade among certain classes perhaps leave something to\r\ndesire in the way of strictness; but the Danubian provinces are not\r\nsupposed to be the abodes of all the virtues and graces. The Hungarians\r\ncould not afford to throw stones at the Servians on the score of\r\nmorality, and the Roumanians certainly would not venture to try the\r\nexperiment. In the interior of Servia the population is pure, and the\r\npatriarchal manner in which the people live tends to preserve them so.\r\nThere is as much difference between the sentiment in Belgrade and that\r\nin the provinces as would be found between Paris and a French rural\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nBut let us drop details concerning Servia, for the brave little country\r\ndemands more serious attention than can be given to it in one or two\r\nbrief articles. The boat which bears me away from the Servian capital\r\nhas come hither from Semlin, the Austrian town on the other side of the\r\nSava River. It is a jaunty and comfortable craft, as befits such vessels\r\nas afford Servians their only means of communication with the outer\r\nworld. If any but Turks had been squatted in Bosnia there would have\r\nbeen many a smart little steamer running down the Sava and around up the\r\nDanube; but the baleful Mussulman has checked all enterprise wherever he\r\nhas had any foothold. We go slowly, cleaving the dull-colored tide,\r\ngazing, as we sit enthroned in easy-chairs on the upper deck, out upon\r\nthe few public institutions of Belgrade--the military college and the\r\nhandsome road leading to the garden of Topschidere, where the\r\nLilliputian court has its tiny summer residence. Sombre memories\r\noverhang this \"Cannoneer's Valley,\" this Topschidere, where Michael, the\r\nson and successor of good Milosch as sovereign prince of the nation,\r\nperished by assassination in 1868. In a few minutes we are whisked round\r\na corner, and a high wooded bluff conceals the White City from our view.\r\n\r\nThe Servian women--and more especially those belonging to the lower\r\nclasses--have a majesty and dignity which are very imposing. One is\r\ninclined at first to believe these are partially due to assumption, but\r\nhe speedily discovers that such is not the case. Blanqui, the French\r\nrevolutionist, who made a tour through Servia in 1840, has given the\r\nworld a curious and interesting account of the conversations which he\r\nheld with Servian women on the subject of the oppression from which the\r\nnation was suffering. Everywhere among the common people he found virile\r\nsentiments expressed by the women, and the princess Lionbitza, he said,\r\nwas \"the prey of a kind of holy fever.\" M. Blanqui described her as a\r\nwoman fifty years old, with a martial, austere yet dreamy physiognomy,\r\nwith strongly-marked features, a proud and sombre gaze, and her head\r\ncrowned with superb gray hair braided and tied with red ribbon. \"Ah!\"\r\nsaid this woman to him, with an accent in her voice which startled him,\r\n\"if all these men round about us here were not women, _or if they were\r\nwomen like me_, we should soon be free from our tormentors!\" It was the\r\nfiery words of such women as this which awoke the Servian men from the\r\nlethargy into which they were falling after Kara George had exhausted\r\nhimself in heroic efforts, and which sent them forth anew to fight for\r\ntheir liberties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE OXEN OF THE DANUBE.]\r\n\r\nAt night, when the moon is good enough to shine, the voyage up the\r\nriver has charms, and tempts one to remain on deck all night, in spite\r\nof the sharp breezes which sweep across the stream. The harmonious\r\naccents of the gentle Servian tongue echo all round you: the song of\r\nthe peasants grouped together, lying in a heap like cattle to keep\r\nwarm, comes occasionally to your ears; and if there be anything\r\ndisagreeable, it is the loud voices and brawling manners of some\r\nAustrian troopers on transfer. From time to time the boat slows her\r\nspeed as she passes through lines or streets of floating mills\r\nanchored securely in the river. Each mill--a small house with sloping\r\nroof, and with so few windows that one wonders how the millers ever\r\nmanage to see their grist--is built upon two boats. The musical hum\r\nof its great wheel is heard for a long distance, and warns one of the\r\napproach toward these pacific industries. The miller is usually on the\r\nlookout, and sometimes, when a large steamer is coming up, and he\r\nanticipates trouble from the \"swell\" which she may create, he may be\r\nseen madly gesticulating and dancing upon his narrow platform in a\r\nfrenzy of anxiety for the fruits of his toil. A little village on a\r\nneck of land or beneath a grove shows where the wives and children of\r\nthese millers live. The mills are a source of prosperity for thousands\r\nof humble folk, and of provocation to hurricanes of profanity on the\r\npart of the Austrian, Italian and Dalmatian captains who are compelled\r\nto pass them. Stealing through an aquatic town of this kind at\r\nmidnight, with the millers all holding out their lanterns, with the\r\nsteamer's bell ringing violently, and with rough voices crying out\r\nwords of caution in at least four languages, produces a curious if not\r\na comical effect on him who has the experience for the first time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISHERMEN'S HUTS ON THE DANUBE.]\r\n\r\nPeaceable as the upper Danube shores look, Arcadian as seems the\r\nsimplicity of their populations, the people are torn by contending\r\npassions, and are watched by the lynx-eyed authorities of two or three\r\ngovernments. The agents of the _Omladina_, the mysterious society which\r\ninterests itself in the propagation of Pan-slavism, have numerous\r\npowerful stations in the Austrian towns, and do much to discontent the\r\nSlavic subjects of Francis Joseph with the rule of the Hapsburgs. There\r\nhave also been instances of conspiracy against the Obrenovich dynasty,\r\nnow in power in Servia, and these have frequently resulted in armed\r\nincursions from the Hungarian side of the stream to the other bank,\r\nwhere a warm reception was not long awaited. In the humblest hamlet\r\nthere are brains hot with ambitious dreams daringly planning some scheme\r\nwhich is too audacious to be realized.\r\n\r\nThe traveller can scarcely believe this when, as the boat stops at some\r\nlittle pier which is half buried under vines and blossoms, he sees the\r\npopulation indulging in an innocent festival with the aid of red and\r\nwhite wine, a few glasses of beer, and bread and cheese. Families\r\nmounted in huge yellow chariots drawn by horses ornamented with\r\ngayly-decorated harnesses, come rattling into town and get down before a\r\nweatherbeaten inn, the signboard above which testifies to respect and\r\nlove for some emperor of long ago. Youths and maidens wander arm in arm\r\nby the foaming tide or sit in the little arbors crooning songs and\r\nclinking glasses. Officers strut about, calling each other loudly by\r\ntheir titles or responding to the sallies of those of their comrades who\r\nfill the after-deck of the steamer. The village mayor in a braided\r\njacket, the wharfmaster in semi-military uniform, and the agent of the\r\nsteamboat company, who appears to have a remarkable penchant for gold\r\nlace and buttons, render the throng still more motley. There is also, in\r\nnine cases out of ten, a band of tooting musicians, and as the boat\r\nmoves away national Hungarian and Austrian airs are played. He would be\r\nindeed a surly fellow who should not lift his cap on these occasions,\r\nand he would be repaid for his obstinacy by the very blackest of looks.\r\n\r\nCarlowitz and Slankamen are two historic spots which an Hungarian, if he\r\nfeels kindly disposed toward a stranger, will point out to him. The\r\nformer is known to Americans by name only, as a rule, and that because\r\nthey have seen it upon bottle-labels announcing excellent wine; but the\r\ntown, with its ancient cathedral, its convents, and its \"chapel of\r\npeace\" built on the site of the structure in which was signed the noted\r\npeace of 1699, deserves a visit. Rumor says that the head-quarters of\r\nthe Omladina are very near this town, so that the foreign visitor must\r\nnot be astonished if the local police seem uncommonly solicitous for his\r\nwelfare while he remains. At Slankamen in 1691 the illustrious margrave\r\nof Baden administered such a thrashing to the Turks that they fled in\r\nthe greatest consternation, and it was long before they rallied again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF MOHACZ.]\r\n\r\nThus, threading in and out among the floating mills, pushing through\r\nreedy channels in the midst of which she narrowly escapes crushing the\r\nboats of fishers, and carefully avoiding the moving banks of sand which\r\nrender navigation as difficult as on the Mississippi, the boat reaches\r\nPeterwardein, high on a mighty mass of rock, and Neusatz opposite,\r\nconnected with its neighbor fortress-town by a bridge of boats. Although\r\nwithin the limits of the Austria-Hungarian empire, Neusatz is almost\r\nentirely Servian in aspect and population, and Peterwardein, which marks\r\nthe military confines of Slavonia, has a large number of Servian\r\ninhabitants. It was the proximity and the earnestness in their cause of\r\nthese people which induced the Hungarians to agree to the military\r\noccupation of Bosnia and the Herzegovina. At one time the obstinate\r\nMagyars would have liked to refuse their adhesion to the decisions of\r\nthe Berlin Congress, but they soon thought better of that. Peterwardein\r\nis the last really imposing object on the Danube before reaching Pesth.\r\nIt is majestic and solemn, with its gloomy castle, its garrison which\r\ncontains several thousand soldiers, and its prison of state. The\r\nremembrance that Peter the Hermit there put himself at the head of the\r\narmy with which the Crusades were begun adds to the mysterious and\r\npowerful fascination of the place. I fancied that I could see the lean\r\nand fanatical priest preaching before the assembled thousands, hurling\r\nhis words down upon them from some lofty pinnacle. No one can blame the\r\nworthy Peter for undertaking his mission if the infidels treated\r\nChristians in the Orient as badly then as they do to-day. Centuries\r\nafter Peter slept in consecrated dust the Turks sat down before\r\nPeterwardein to besiege it, but they had only their labor for their\r\npains, for Prince Eugene drove them away. This was in 1716. It seems\r\nhard to believe that a hostile force of Turks was powerful enough to\r\nwander about Christendom a little more than a century and a half ago.\r\n\r\nAfter passing Peterwardein and Neusatz the boat's course lies through\r\nthe vast Hungarian plain, which reminds the American of some of the rich\r\nlands in the Mississippi bottom. Here is life, lusty, crude, seemingly\r\nnot of Europe, but rather of the extreme West or East. As far as the eye\r\ncan reach on either hand stretch the level acres, dotted with herds of\r\ninquisitive swine, with horses wild and beautiful snorting and\r\ngambolling as they hear the boat's whistle, and peasants in white linen\r\njackets and trousers and immense black woollen hats. Fishers by hundreds\r\nbalance in their little skiffs on the small whirlpool of waves made by\r\nthe steamer, and sing gayly. For a stretch of twenty miles the course\r\nmay lie near an immense forest, where millions of stout trees stand in\r\nregular rows, where thousands of oaks drop acorns every year to fatten\r\nthousands upon thousands of pigs. Cattle stray in these woods, and\r\nsometimes the peasant-farmer has a veritable hunt before he can find his\r\nown. Afar in the wooded recesses of Slavonia many convents of the Greek\r\nreligion are hidden. Their inmates lead lives which have little or no\r\nrelation to anything in the nineteenth century. For them wars and rumors\r\nof wars, Russian aggression, Austrian annexation, conspiracies by Kara\r\nGeorgewitch, Hungarian domination in the Cabinet at Vienna, and all such\r\ntrivial matters, do not exist. The members of these religious\r\ncommunities are not like the more active members of the clergy of their\r\nChurch, who unquestionably have much to do with promoting war and\r\nsupporting it when it is in aid of their nationality and their religion.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable sights in this region is a herd of the noble\r\n\"cattle of the steppes,\" the beasts in which every Hungarian takes so\r\nmuch pride. These cattle are superb creatures, and as they stand eying\r\nthe passers-by one regrets that he has not more time in which to admire\r\ntheir exquisite white skins, their long symmetrical horns and their\r\nshapely limbs. They appear to be good-tempered, but it would not be wise\r\nto risk one's self on foot in their immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAs for the fishermen, some of them seem to prefer living on the water\r\nrather than on dry land. Indeed, the marshy borders of the Danube are\r\nnot very healthy, and it is not astonishing that men do not care to make\r\ntheir homes on these low lands. There are several aquatic towns between\r\nPesth and the point at which the Drava (or Drau), a noble river, empties\r\nits waters into the Danube. Apatin is an assemblage of huts which appear\r\nto spring from the bosom of the current, but as the steamer approaches\r\none sees that these huts are built upon piles driven firmly into the\r\nriver-bed, and between these singular habitations are other piles upon\r\nwhich nets are stretched. So the fisherman, without going a hundred\r\nyards from his own door, traps the wily denizens of the Danube, prepares\r\nthem for market, and at night goes peacefully to sleep in his rough bed,\r\nlulled by the rushing of the strong current beneath him. I am bound to\r\nconfess that the fishermen of Apatin impressed me as being rather\r\nrheumatic, but perhaps this was only a fancy.\r\n\r\nBesdan, with its low hills garnished with windmills and its shores lined\r\nwith silvery willows, is the only other point of interest, save Mohacz,\r\nbefore reaching Pesth. Hour after hour the traveller sees the same\r\npanorama of steppes covered with swine, cattle and horses, with\r\noccasional farms--their outbuildings protected against brigands and\r\nfuture wars by stout walls--and with pools made by inundations of the\r\nimpetuous Danube. Mohacz is celebrated for two tremendous battles in the\r\npast, and for a fine cathedral, a railway and a coaling-station at\r\npresent. Louis II., king of Hungary, was there undone by Suleiman in\r\n1526; and there, a hundred and fifty years later, did the Turks come to\r\nsorrow by the efforts of the forces under Charles IV. of Lorraine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BRIDGE OF BUDA-PESTH.]\r\n\r\nJust as I was beginning to believe that the slow-going steamer on which\r\nI had embarked my fortunes was held back by enchantment--for we were\r\nhalf a day ascending the stream from Mohacz--we came in sight of a huge\r\ncliff almost inaccessible from one side, and a few minutes later could\r\ndiscern the towers of Buda and the mansions of Pesth. While nearing the\r\nlanding-place and hastening hither and yon to look after various small\r\nbundles and boxes, I had occasion to address an Hungarian gentleman. In\r\nthe course of some conversation which followed I remarked that Pesth\r\nseemed a thriving place, and that one would hardly have expected to find\r\ntwo such flourishing towns as Vienna and Pesth so near each other.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said he with a little sneer which his slight foreign accent (he\r\nwas speaking French) rendered almost ludicrous, \"Vienna is a smart town,\r\nbut it is nothing to this!\" And he pointed with pride to his native\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nAlthough I could not exactly agree with this extravagant estimate of the\r\nextent of Pesth, I could not deny that it was vastly superior to my idea\r\nof it. When one arrives there from the south-east, after many wanderings\r\namong semi-barbaric villages and little cities on the outskirts of\r\ncivilization, he finds Pesth very impressive. The Hungarian shepherds\r\nand the boatmen who ply between the capital and tiny forts below fancy\r\nthat it is the end of the world. They have vaguely heard of Vienna, but\r\ntheir patriotism is so intense and their round of life so circumscribed\r\nthat they never succeed in forming a definite idea of its proportions or\r\nits location. Communication between the two chief towns of the\r\nAustria-Hungarian empire is also much less frequent than one would\r\nimagine. The Hungarians go but little to Vienna, even the members of the\r\nnobility preferring to consecrate their resources to the support of the\r\nsplendors of their own city rather than to contribute them to the\r\nAustrian metropolis. Seven hours' ride in what the Austrians are bold\r\nenough to term an express-train covers the distance between Vienna and\r\nPesth, yet there seems to be an abyss somewhere on the route which the\r\ninhabitants are afraid of. Pride, a haughty determination not to submit\r\nto centralization, and content with their surroundings make the\r\nHungarians sparing of intercourse with their Austrian neighbors. \"We\r\nsend them prime ministers, and now and then we allow them a glimpse of\r\nsome of our beauties in one of their palaces, but the latter does not\r\nhappen very often,\" once said an Hungarian friend to me.\r\n\r\nAn American who should arrive in Pesth fancying that he was about to see\r\na specimen of the dilapidated towns of \"effete and decaying Europe\"\r\nwould find himself vastly mistaken. The beautiful and costly modern\r\nbuildings on every principal street, the noble bridges across the vast\r\nriver, the fine railway-stations, the handsome theatres, the palatial\r\nhotels, would explain to him why it is that the citizens of Pesth speak\r\nof their town as the \"Chicago of the East.\" There was a time when it\r\nreally seemed as if Pesth would rival, if not exceed, Chicago in the\r\nextent of her commerce, the vivacity and boldness of her enterprises and\r\nthe rapid increase of her population. Austria and Hungary were alike the\r\nprey of a feverish agitation which pervaded all classes. In a single day\r\nat Vienna as many as thirty gigantic stock companies were formed;\r\nhundreds of superb structures sprang up monthly; people who had been\r\nbeggars but a few months before rode in carriages and bestowed gold by\r\nhandfuls on whoever came first. The wind or some mysterious agency which\r\nno one could explain brought this financial pestilence to Pesth, where\r\nit raged until the _Krach_--the Crash, as the Germans very properly call\r\nit--came. After the extraordinary activity which had prevailed there\r\ncame gloom and stagnation; but at last, as in America, business in Pesth\r\nand in Hungary generally is gradually assuming solidity and contains\r\nitself within proper bounds. The exciting period had one beneficial\r\nfeature: it made Pesth a handsome city. There are no quays in Europe\r\nmore substantial and elegant than those along the Danube in the\r\nHungarian capital, and no hotels, churches and mansions more splendid\r\nthan those fronting on these same quays. At eventide, when the whole\r\npopulation comes out for an airing and loiters by the parapets which\r\noverlook the broad rushing river, when innumerable lights gleam from the\r\nboats anchored on either bank, and when the sound of music and song is\r\nheard from half a hundred windows, no city can boast a spectacle more\r\nanimated. At ten o'clock the streets are deserted. Pesth is exceedingly\r\nproper and decorous as soon as the darkness has fallen, although I do\r\nremember to have seen a torchlight procession there during the\r\nRusso-Turkish war. The inhabitants were so enthusiastic over the arrival\r\nof a delegation of Mussulman students from Constantinople that they put\r\nten thousand torches in line and marched until a late hour, thinking,\r\nperhaps, that the lurid light on the horizon might be seen as far as\r\nVienna, and might serve as a warning to the Austrian government not to\r\ngo too far in its sympathy with Russia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CITADEL OF BUDA]\r\n\r\nBuda-Pesth is the name by which the Hungarians know their capital, and\r\nBuda is by no means the least important portion of the city. It occupies\r\nthe majestic and rugged hill directly opposite Pesth--a hill so steep\r\nthat a tunnel containing cars propelled upward and downward by machinery\r\nhas been arranged to render Buda easy of access. Where the hill slopes\r\naway southward there are various large villages crowded with Servians,\r\nCroatians and Low Hungarians, who huddle together in a rather\r\nuncivilized manner. A fortress where there were many famous fights and\r\nsieges in the times of the Turks occupies a summit a little higher than\r\nBuda, so that in case of insurrection a few hot shot could be dropped\r\namong the inhabitants. Curiously enough, however, there are thousands of\r\nloyal Austrians, German by birth, living in Buda--or Ofen, as the\r\nTeutons call it--whereas in Pesth, out of the two hundred thousand\r\ninhabitants, scarcely three thousand are of Austrian birth. As long as\r\ntroops devoted to Francis Joseph hold Buda there is little chance for\r\nthe citizens of Pesth to succeed in revolt. Standing on the terrace of\r\nthe rare old palace on Buda's height, I looked down on Pesth with the\r\nsame range of vision that I should have had in a balloon. Every quarter\r\nof the city would be fully exposed to an artillery fire from these\r\ngigantic hills.\r\n\r\nBuda is not rich in the modern improvements which render Pesth so\r\nnoticeable. I found no difficulty in some of the nooks and corners of\r\nthis quaint town in imagining myself back in the Middle Ages. Tottering\r\nchurches, immensely tall houses overhanging yawning and precipitous\r\nalleys, markets set on little shelves in the mountain, hovels protesting\r\nagainst sliding down into the valley, whither they seemed inevitably\r\ndoomed to go, succeeded one another in rapid panorama. Here were\r\ncostume, theatrical effect, artistic grouping: it was like Ragusa,\r\nSpalatro and Sebenico. Old and young women sat on the ground in the\r\nmarkets, as our negroes do in Lynchburg in Virginia: they held up fruit\r\nand vegetables and shrieked out the prices in a dialect which seemed a\r\ncompound of Hungarian and German. Austrian soldiers and Hungarian\r\nrecruits, the former clad in brown jackets and blue hose, the latter in\r\nbuff doublets and red trousers, and wearing feathers in their caps,\r\nmarched and countermarched, apparently going nowhere in particular, but\r\nmerely keeping up discipline by means of exercise.\r\n\r\nThe emperor comes often to the fine palace on Buda hill, and sallies\r\nforth from it to hunt with some of the nobles on their immense estates.\r\nThe empress is passionately fond of Hungary, and spends no small portion\r\nof her time there. The Hungarians receive this consideration from their\r\nsovereign lady as very natural, and speak of her as a person of great\r\ngood sense. The German and Slavic citizens of Austria say that there are\r\nbut two failings of which Her Imperial Majesty can be accused--she loves\r\nthe Hungarians and she is too fond of horses. Nothing delights the\r\ncitizens of Pesth so much as to find that the Slavs are annoyed, for\r\nthere is no love lost between Slav and Magyar. A natural antipathy has\r\nbeen terribly increased by the fear on the part of Hungary that she may\r\nlose her influence in the composite empire one day, owing to the Slavic\r\nregeneration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MUSEUM AND SEAT OF THE DIET AT PESTH.]\r\n\r\nAt Pesth they do not speak of the \"beautiful blue Danube,\" because there\r\nthe river ceases to be of that color, which Johann Strauss has so\r\nenthusiastically celebrated. But between Vienna and Pesth the blue is\r\nclearly perceptible, and the current is lovely even a few miles from the\r\nislands in the stream near the Hungarian capital. The Margarethen-Insel,\r\nwhich is but a short distance above Pesth, is a little paradise. It has\r\nbeen transformed by private munificence into a rich garden full of\r\ncharming shaded nooks and rare plants and flowers. In the middle of this\r\npleasure-ground are extensive bath-houses and mineral springs. Morning,\r\nnoon and night gypsy bands make seductive music, and the notes of their\r\nmelodies recall the strange lands far away down the stream--Roumania,\r\nthe hills and valleys of the Banat and the savage Servian mountains.\r\nAlong the river-side there are other resorts in which, in these days,\r\nwhen business has not yet entirely recovered from the _Krach_, there are\r\nmultitudes of loungers. In midsummer no Hungarian need go farther than\r\nthese baths of Pesth to secure rest and restore health. The Romans were\r\nso pleased with the baths in the neighborhood that they founded a colony\r\non the site of Buda-Pesth, although they had no particular strategic\r\nreasons for doing so. As you sit in the pleasant shade you will probably\r\nhear the inspiring notes of the _Rakoczy_, the march of which the\r\nHungarians are so passionately fond, which recalls the souvenirs of\r\ntheir revolutions and awakens a kind of holy exaltation in their hearts.\r\nThe _Rakoczy_ has been often enough fantastically described: some hear\r\nin it the gallop of horsemen, the clashing of arms, the songs of women\r\nand the cries of wounded men. A clever Frenchman has even written two\r\ncolumns of analysis of the march, and he found in it nearly as much as\r\nthere is in Goethe's _Faust_. These harmless fancies are of little use\r\nin aiding to a veritable understanding of the wonderful march. It\r\nsuffices to say that one cannot hear it played, even by a strolling band\r\nof gypsies, without a strange fluttering of the heart, an excitement and\r\nan enthusiasm which are beyond one's control. A nation with such a\r\n_Marseillaise_ as the _Rakoczy_ certainly ought to go far in time of\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe Hungarians are a martial people, and are fond of reciting their\r\nexploits. Every old guide in Pesth will tell you, in a variegated\r\nEnglish which will provoke your smiles, all the incidents of the\r\nHungarian revolution, the events of 1848 and 1849--how the Austrians\r\nwere driven across the great bridge over the Danube, etc.--with infinite\r\ngusto. The humblest wharf-laborer takes a vital interest in the welfare\r\nof his country, even if he is not intelligent enough to know from what\r\nquarter hostilities might be expected. There is a flash in an\r\nHungarian's eye when he speaks of the events of 1848 which is equalled\r\nonly by the lightnings evoked from his glance by the magic echoes of the\r\n_Rakoczy_.\r\n\r\nThe peasantry round about Pesth, and the poor wretches, Slavic and\r\nHungarian, who work on the streets, seem in sad plight. A friend one day\r\ncalled my attention to a number of old women, most miserably clad,\r\nbarefooted and bent with age and infirmities, carrying stones and\r\nbricks to a new building. The spectacle was enough to make one's heart\r\nbleed, but my friend assured me that the old women were happy, and that\r\nthey lived on bread and an occasional onion, with a little water for\r\ndrink or sometimes a glass of adulterated white wine. The men working\r\nwith them looked even worse fed and more degraded than the women. In the\r\npoor quarters of Pesth, and more especially those inhabited by the Jews,\r\nthe tenements are exceedingly filthy, and the aroma is so uninviting\r\nthat one hastens away from the streets where these rookeries abound. The\r\nutmost civility, not to say servility, may always be expected of the\r\nlower classes: some of them seize one's hand and kiss it as the Austrian\r\nservants do. Toward strangers Hungarians of all ranks are unfailingly\r\ncivil and courteous. A simple letter of introduction will procure one a\r\nhost of attentions which he would not have the right to expect in\r\nEngland or America.\r\n\r\nThe mound of earth on the bank of the Danube near the quays of Pesth\r\nrepresents the soil of every Hungarian province; and from that mound the\r\nemperor of Austria, when he was crowned king of Hungary, was forced to\r\nshake his sword against the four quarters of the globe, thus signifying\r\nhis intention of defending the country from any attack whatsoever. Thus\r\nfar he has succeeded in doing it, and in keeping on good terms with the\r\nlegislative bodies of the country, without whose co-operation he cannot\r\nexercise his supreme authority. These bodies are a chamber of peers,\r\nrecruited from the prelates, counts and such aristocrats as sit there by\r\nright of birth, and a second chamber, which is composed of four hundred\r\nand thirteen deputies elected from as many districts for the term of\r\nthree years, and thirty-four delegates from the autonomous province of\r\nCroatia-Slavonia. The entrance to the diet is guarded by a\r\nfrosty-looking servitor in an extravagant Hungarian uniform, jacket and\r\nhose profusely covered with brilliant braids, and varnished jack-boots.\r\nThe deputies when in session are quiet, orderly and dignified, save\r\nwhen the word \"Russian\" is pronounced. It is a word which arouses all\r\ntheir hatred.\r\n\r\nBuda-Pesth is about to undergo a formidable series of improvements\r\nnotwithstanding the illusions which were dispersed by the _Krach_. One\r\nof the most conspicuous and charming municipal displays in the Paris\r\nExposition is the group of charts and plans sent from Pesth. The patriot\r\nDeak is to have a colossal monument; the quays are to be rendered more\r\nsubstantial against inundations than they are at present; and many\r\nmassive public edifices are to be erected. The Danube is often unruly,\r\nand once nearly destroyed the city of Pesth, also doing much damage\r\nalong the slopes of Buda. If an inundation should come within the next\r\ntwo or three years millions of florins' worth of property might be swept\r\naway in a single night. The opera, the principal halls of assembly and\r\nthe hotels of Pesth will challenge comparison with those of any town of\r\ntwo hundred thousand population in the world; and the Grand Hotel\r\nHungaria has few equals in cities of the largest size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLAV WOMAN IN PESTH.]\r\n\r\nThe Hungarians are a handsome race, and the people of Pesth and vicinity\r\nhave especial claims to attention for their beauty. The men of the\r\nmiddle and upper classes are tall, slender, graceful, and their features\r\nare exceedingly regular and pleasing. The women are so renowned that a\r\ndescription of their charms is scarcely necessary. Beautiful as are the\r\nViennese ladies in their early youth, they cannot rival their\r\nfellow-subjects of Hungary. The Austrian woman grows fat, matronly and\r\nrather coarse as she matures: the Hungarian lady of forty is still as\r\nwillowy, graceful and capricious as she was at twenty. The\r\npeasant-women, poor things! are ugly, because they work from morning\r\ntill night in the vineyards, toiling until their backs are broken. The\r\nwine which the beauties drink costs their humbler sisters their\r\nlife-blood, their grace, their happiness. The sunshine of a thousand\r\nexistences is imprisoned in the vintages of Pressburg and Carlowitz.\r\nPoor, homely toilers in the fields! Poor human creatures transformed\r\ninto beasts of burden! The Hungarian nation owes it to itself to\r\nemancipate these struggling women and show them the way to better\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nEDWARD KING.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"FOR PERCIVAL.\"\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII ENGAGEMENTS--HOSTILE AND OTHERWISE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fairest season of the year, the debatable ground between spring and\r\nsummer, had come round once more. There were leaves on the trees and\r\nflowers in the grass. The sunshine was golden and full, not like the\r\nbleak brightness of March. The winds were warm, the showers soft.\r\nPercival, always keenly affected by such influences, felt as if a new\r\nlife had come to him with the spring. Now that the evenings had grown\r\nlong and light, he could escape into the country, breathe a purer air\r\nand wander in fields and lanes. And as he wandered, musing, it seemed to\r\nhim that he had awakened from a dream.\r\n\r\nHe looked back upon the past year, and he was more than half inclined to\r\ncall himself a fool. He had taken up work for which he was not fit. He\r\ncould see that now. He knew very well that his life was almost\r\nintolerable, and that it would never be more tolerable unless help came\r\nfrom without. He could never grow accustomed to his drudgery. He could\r\nwork honestly, but he could never put his heart into it. And even if he\r\ncould have displayed ten times as much energy, if his aptitude for\r\nbusiness had been ten times as great, if Mr. Ferguson had estimated him\r\nso highly as to take him as articled clerk, if he had passed all his\r\nexaminations and been duly admitted, if the brightest possibilities in\r\nsuch a life as his had become realities and he had attained at last to a\r\nsmall share in the business,--what would be the end of this most\r\nimprobable success? Merely that he would have to spend his whole life in\r\nBrenthill absorbed in law. Now, the law was a weariness to him, and he\r\nloathed Brenthill. Yet he had voluntarily accepted a life which could\r\noffer him no higher prize than such a fate as this, when Godfrey Hammond\r\nor Mrs. Middleton, or even old Hardwicke, would no doubt have helped him\r\nto something better.\r\n\r\nCertainly he had been a fool; and yet, while he realized this truth, he\r\nsincerely respected--I might almost say he admired--his own folly. He\r\nhad been sick of dependence, and he had gone down at once to the bottom\r\nof everything, taken his stand on firm ground and conquered independence\r\nfor himself. He had gained the precious knowledge that he could earn his\r\nown living by the labor of his hands. He might have been a fool to\r\nreject the help that would have opened some higher and less distasteful\r\ncareer to him, yet if he had accepted it he would never have known the\r\nextent of his own powers. He would have been a hermit-crab still, fitted\r\nwith another shell by the kindness of his friends. Had he clearly\r\nunderstood what he was doing when he went to Brenthill, it was very\r\nlikely that he might never have gone. He was almost glad that he had not\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having conquered in the race, could he go back and ask for the\r\nhelp which he had once refused? Hardly. The life in which we first gain\r\nindependence may be stern and ugly, the independence itself--when we\r\ngather in our harvest--may have a rough and bitter taste, yet it will\r\nspoil the palate for all other flavors. They will seem sickly sweet\r\nafter its wholesome austerity. Neither did Percival feel any greater\r\ndesire for a career of any kind than he had felt a year earlier when he\r\ntalked over his future life with Godfrey Hammond. If he were asked what\r\nwas his day-dream, his castle in the air, the utmost limit of his\r\nearthly wishes, he would answer now as he would have answered then,\r\n\"Brackenhill,\" dismissing the impossible idea with a smile even as he\r\nuttered it. Asked what would content him--since we can hardly hope to\r\ndraw the highest prize in our life's lottery--he would answer now as\r\nthen--to have an assured income sufficient to allow him to wander on the\r\nContinent, to see pictures, old towns, Alps, rivers, blue sky;\r\nwandering, to remain a foreigner all his life, so that there might\r\nalways be something a little novel and curious about his food and his\r\nmanner of living (things which are apt to grow so hideously commonplace\r\nin the land where one is born), to drink the wine of the country, to\r\nread many poems in verse, in prose, in the scenery around; and through\r\nit all, from first to last, to \"dream deliciously.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, even while he felt that his desire was unchanged, he knew that\r\nthere was a fresh obstacle between him and its fulfilment. Heaven help\r\nhim! had there not been enough before? Was it needful that it should\r\nbecome clear to him that nowhere on earth could he find the warmth and\r\nthe sunlight for which he pined while a certain pair of sad eyes grew\r\never sadder and sadder looking out on the murky sky, the smoke, the\r\ndust, the busy industry of Brenthill? How could he go away? Even these\r\nquiet walks of his had pain mixed with their pleasure when he thought\r\nthat there was no such liberty for Judith Lisle. Not for her the\r\ncowslips in the upland pastures, the hawthorn in the hedges, the\r\nelm-boughs high against the breezy sky, the first dog-roses pink upon\r\nthe briers. Percival turned from them to look at the cloud which hung\r\never like a dingy smear above Brenthill, and the more he felt their\r\nloveliness the more he felt her loss.\r\n\r\nHe had no walk on Sunday mornings. A few months earlier Mr. Clifton of\r\nSt. Sylvester's would have claimed him as a convert. Now he was equally\r\ndevout, but it was the evangelical minister, Mr. Bradbury of Christ\r\nChurch, who saw him week after week a regular attendant, undaunted and\r\nsleepless though the sermon should be divided into seven heads. Mr.\r\nBradbury preached terribly, in a voice which sometimes died mournfully\r\naway or hissed in a melodramatic whisper, and then rose suddenly in a\r\nthreatening cry. Miss Macgregor sat in front of a gallery and looked\r\ndown on the top of her pastor's head. The double row of little boys who\r\nwere marshalled at her side grew drowsy in the hot weather, blinked\r\nfeebly as the discourse progressed, and nodded at the congregation. Now\r\nand then Mr. Bradbury, who was only, as it were, at arm's length, turned\r\na little, looked up and flung a red-hot denunciation into the front\r\nseats of the gallery. The little boys woke up, heard what was most\r\nlikely in store for them on the last day, and sat with eyes wide open\r\ndismally surveying the prospect. But presently the next boy fidgeted, or\r\na spider let himself down from the roof, or a bird flew past the window,\r\nor a slanting ray of sunlight revealed a multitude of dusty dancing\r\nmotes, and the little lads forgot Mr. Bradbury, who had forgotten them\r\nand was busy with somebody else. It might be with the pope: Mr. Bradbury\r\nwas fond of providing for the pope. Or perhaps he was wasting his energy\r\non Percival Thorne, who sat with his head thrown back and his upward\r\nglance just missing the preacher, and was quite undisturbed by his\r\nappeals.\r\n\r\nJudith Lisle had accepted the offer of a situation at Miss Macgregor's\r\nwith the expectation of being worked to death, only hoping, as she told\r\nMrs. Barton, that the process would be slow. The hope would not have\r\nbeen at all an unreasonable one if she had undertaken her task in the\r\ndays when she had Bertie to work for. She could have lived through much\r\nwhen she lived for Bertie. But, losing her brother, the mainspring of\r\nher life seemed broken. One would have said that she had leaned on him,\r\nnot he on her, she drooped so pitifully now he was gone. Even Miss\r\nMacgregor noticed that Miss Lisle was delicate, and expressed her strong\r\ndisapprobation of such a state of affairs. Mrs. Barton thought Judith\r\nlooking very far from well, suggested tonics, and began to consider\r\nwhether she might ask her to go to them for her summer holidays. But to\r\nPercival's eyes there was a change from week to week, and he watched her\r\nwith terror in his heart. Judith had grown curiously younger during the\r\nlast few months. There had been something of a mother's tenderness in\r\nher love for Bertie, which made her appear more than her real age and\r\ngave decision and stateliness to her manner. Now that she was alone, she\r\nwas only a girl, silent and shrinking, needing all her strength to\r\nsuffer and hide her sorrow. Percival knew that each Sunday, as soon as\r\nshe had taken her place, she would look downward to the pew where he\r\nalways sat to ascertain if he were there. For a moment he would meet\r\nthat quiet gaze, lucid, uncomplaining, but very sad. Then her eyes would\r\nbe turned to her book or to the little boys who sat near her, or it\r\nmight even be to Mr. Bradbury. The long service would begin, go on, come\r\nto an end. But before she left her place her glance would meet his once\r\nmore, as if in gentle farewell until another Sunday should come round.\r\nPercival would not for worlds have failed at that trysting-place, but he\r\ncursed his helplessness. Could he do nothing for Judith but cheer her\r\nthrough Mr. Bradbury's sermons?\r\n\r\nAbout this time he used deliberately to indulge in an impossible fancy.\r\nHis imagination dwelt on their two lives, cramped, dwarfed and fettered.\r\nHe had lost his freedom, but it seemed to him that Judith, burdened once\r\nwith riches, and later with poverty, never had been free. He looked\r\nforward, and saw nothing in the future but a struggle for existence\r\nwhich might be prolonged through years of labor and sordid care. Why\r\nwere they bound to endure this? Why could they not give up all for just\r\na few days of happiness? Percival longed intensely for a glimpse of\r\nbeauty, for a little space of warmth and love, of wealth and liberty.\r\nLet their life thus blossom together into joy, and he would be content\r\nthat it should be, like the flowering of the aloe, followed by swift and\r\ninevitable death. Only let the death be shared like the life! It would\r\nbe bitter and terrible to be struck down in their gladness, but if they\r\nhad truly lived they might be satisfied to die. Percival used to fancy\r\nwhat they might do in one glorious, golden, sunlit week, brilliant\r\nagainst a black background of death. How free they would be to spend all\r\nthey possessed without a thought for the future! Nothing could pall upon\r\nthem, and he pictured to himself how every sense would be quickened, how\r\npassion would gather strength and tenderness, during those brief days,\r\nand rise to its noblest height to meet the end. His imagination revelled\r\nin the minute details of the picture, adding one by one a thousand\r\ntouches of beauty and joy till the dream was lifelike in its loveliness.\r\nHe could pass in a moment from his commonplace world to this enchanted\r\nlife with Judith. Living alone, and half starving himself in the attempt\r\nto pay his debts, he was in a fit state to see visions and dream dreams.\r\nBut they only made his present life more distasteful to him, and the\r\nmore he dreamed of Judith the more he felt that he had nothing to offer\r\nher.\r\n\r\nHe was summoned abruptly from his fairyland one night by the arrival of\r\nMrs. Bryant. She made her appearance rather suddenly, and sat down on a\r\nchair by the door to have a little chat with her lodger. \"I came back\r\nthis afternoon,\" she said. \"I didn't tell Lydia: where was the use of\r\nbothering about writing to her? Besides, I could just have a look round,\r\nand see how Emma'd done the work while I was away, and how things had\r\ngone on altogether.\" She nodded her rusty black cap confidentially at\r\nPercival. It was sprinkled with bugles, which caught the light of his\r\nsolitary candle.\r\n\r\n\"I hope you found all right,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty well,\" Mrs. Bryant allowed. \"It's a mercy when there's no\r\nillness nor anything of that kind, though, if you'll excuse my saying\r\nit, Mr. Thorne, you ain't looking as well yourself as I should have\r\nliked to see you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I am all right, thank you,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bryant shook her head. The different movement brought out quite a\r\ndifferent effect of glancing bugles. \"Young people should be careful of\r\ntheir health,\" was her profound remark.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you there's nothing the matter with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well! we'll hope not,\" she answered, \"though you certainly do\r\nlook altered, Mr. Thorne, through being thinner in the face and darker\r\nunder the eyes.\"\r\n\r\nPercival smiled impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"What was I saying?\" Mrs. Bryant continued. \"Oh yes--that there was a\r\nmany mercies to be thankful for. To find the house all right, and the\r\ntimes and times I've dreamed of fire and the engines not to be had, and\r\nwoke up shaking so as you'd hardly believe it! And I don't really think\r\nthat I've gone to bed hardly one night without wondering whether Lydia\r\nhad fastened the door and the little window into the yard, which is not\r\nsafe if left open. As regular as clockwork, when the time came round,\r\nI'd mention it to my sister.\"\r\n\r\nPercival sighed briefly, probably pitying the sister. \"I think Miss\r\nBryant has been very careful in fastening everything,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it does seem so, and very thankful I am. And as I always say when\r\nI go out, 'Waste I _must_ expect, and waste I _do_ expect,' but it's a\r\nmercy when there's no thieving.\"\r\n\r\n\"Things will hardly go on quite the same when you are not here to look\r\nafter them, Mrs. Bryant.\"\r\n\r\n\"No: how should they?\" the landlady acquiesced. \"Young heads ain't like\r\nold ones, as I said one evening to my sister when Smith was by. 'Young\r\nheads ain't like old ones,' said I. 'Why, no,' said Smith: 'they're a\r\ndeal prettier.' I told him he ought to have done thinking of such\r\nthings. And so he ought--a man of his age! But that's what the young men\r\nmostly think of, ain't it, Mr. Thorne? Though it's the old heads make\r\nthe best housekeepers, I think, when there's a lot of lodgers to look\r\nafter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"I dare say you think there'd be fine times for the young men lodgers if\r\nit wasn't for the old heads. And I don't blame you, Mr. Thorne: it's\r\nonly natural, and what we must expect in growing old. And if anything\r\ncould make one grow old before one's time, and live two years in one, so\r\nto speak, I do think it's letting lodgings.\"\r\n\r\nPercival expressed himself as not surprised to hear it, though very\r\nsorry that lodgers were so injurious to her health.\r\n\r\n\"There's my drawing-room empty now, and two bedrooms,\" Mrs. Bryant\r\ncontinued. \"Not but what I've had an offer for it this very afternoon,\r\nsince coming back. But it doesn't do to be too hasty. Respectable\r\nparties who pay regular,\" she nodded a little at Percival as if to point\r\nthe compliment, \"are the parties for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"A queer business that of young Mr. Lisle's, wasn't it?\" she went on. \"I\r\nshould say it was about time that Miss Crawford did shut up, if she\r\ncouldn't manage her young ladies better. I sent my Lydia to a\r\nboarding-school once, but it was one of a different kind to that. Pretty\r\ngoings on there were at Standon Square, I'll be bound, if we only knew\r\nthe truth. But as far as this goes there ain't no great harm done, that\r\nI can see. He hasn't done badly for himself, and I dare say they'll be\r\nvery comfortable. She might have picked a worse--I will say that--for he\r\nwas always a pleasant-spoken young gentleman, and good-looking too,\r\nthough that's not a thing to set much store by. And they do say he had\r\nseen better times.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused. Percival murmured something which was quite unintelligible,\r\nbut it served to start her off again, apparently under the impression\r\nthat she had heard a remark of some kind.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suppose so. And as I was saying to Lydia--The coolness of them\r\nboth! banns and all regular! But there now! I'm talking and talking,\r\nforgetting that you were in the thick of it. You knew all about it, I've\r\nno doubt, and finely you and he must have laughed in your sleeves--\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew nothing about it, Mrs. Bryant--nothing.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bryant smiled cunningly and nodded at him again. But it was an\r\noblique nod this time, and there was a sidelong look to match it.\r\nPercival felt as if he were suffering from an aggravated form of\r\nnightmare.\r\n\r\n\"No, no: I dare say you didn't. At any rate, you won't let out if you\r\ndid: why should you? It's a great thing to hold one's tongue, Mr.\r\nThorne; and I ought to know, for I've found the advantage of being\r\nnaturally a silent woman. And I don't say but what you are wise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew nothing,\" he repeated doggedly.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't suppose it was any the worse for anybody who _did_ know,\"\r\nsaid Mrs. Bryant. \"And though, of course, Miss Lisle lost her situation\r\nthrough it, I dare say she finds it quite made up to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" said Percival shortly. The conversation was becoming\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you may depend upon it she does,\" said Mrs. Bryant. \"How should a\r\ngentleman like you know all the ins and outs, Mr. Thorne? It makes all\r\nthe difference to a young woman having a brother well-to-do in the\r\nworld. And very fond of her he always seemed to be, as I was remarking\r\nto Lydia.\"\r\n\r\nPercival felt as if his blood were on fire. He dared not profess too\r\nintimate a knowledge of Judith's feelings and position, and he could not\r\nlisten in silence. \"I think you are mistaken, Mrs. Bryant,\" he said, in\r\na tone which would have betrayed his angry disgust to any more sensitive\r\near. Even his landlady perceived that the subject was not a welcome one.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well!\" she said. \"It doesn't matter, and I'll only wish you as\r\ngood luck as Mr. Lisle; for I'm sure you deserve a young lady with a\r\nlittle bit of money as well as he did; and no reason why you shouldn't\r\nlook to find one, one of these fine days.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Mrs. Bryant, I sha'n't copy Mr. Lisle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, you've something else in your eye, I can see, and perhaps one might\r\nmake a guess as to a name. Well, people must manage those things their\r\nown way, and interfering mostly does harm, I take it. And I'll wish you\r\nluck, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think there's any occasion for your good wishes,\" said\r\nPercival. \"Thank you all the same.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not but what I'm sorry to lose Mr. and Miss Lisle,\" Mrs. Bryant\r\ncontinued, as if that were the natural end of her previous sentence,\r\n\"for they paid for everything most regular.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope these people who want to come may do the same,\" said Percival.\r\nThough he knew that he ran the risk of hearing all that Mrs. Bryant\r\ncould tell him about their condition and prospects, he felt he could\r\nendure anything that would turn the conversation from the Lisles and\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut there was a different train of ideas in Mrs. Bryant's mind. \"And, by\r\nthe way,\" she said, \"I think we've some little accounts to settle\r\ntogether, Mr. Thorne.\" Then Percival perceived, for the first time, that\r\nshe held a folded bit of paper in her hand. The moment that he feared\r\nhad come. He rose without a word, went to his desk and unlocked it.\r\nGlancing over his shoulder, he saw that Mrs. Bryant had approached the\r\ntable, had opened the paper and was flattening it out with her hand. He\r\nstooped over his hoard--a meagre little hoard this time--counting what\r\nhe had to give her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bryant began to hunt in her purse for a receipt stamp. \"It's a\r\npleasure to have to do with a gentleman who is always so regular,\" she\r\nsaid with an approving smile.\r\n\r\nPercival, who was steadying a little pile of coin on the sloping desk,\r\nfelt a strong desire to tell her the state of affairs while he stooped\r\nin the shadow with his face turned away. Precisely because he felt this\r\ndesire he drew himself up to his full height, walked to the table,\r\nlooked straight into her eyes and said, \"Not so very regular this time,\r\nMrs. Bryant.\"\r\n\r\nShe stepped back with a perplexed and questioning expression, but she\r\nunderstood that something was wrong, and the worn face fell suddenly,\r\ndeepening a multitude of melancholy wrinkles. He laid the money before\r\nher: \"That's just half of what I owe you: I think you'll find I have\r\ncounted it all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Half? But where's the other half, Mr. Thorne?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I must earn the other half, Mrs. Bryant. You shall have it as\r\nsoon as I get it.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him. \"You've got to earn it?\" she repeated. Her tone\r\nwould have been more appropriate if Percival had said he must steal it.\r\nThere was a pause: Mrs. Bryant's lean hand closed over the money. \"I\r\ndon't understand this, Mr. Thorne--I don't understand it at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very simple,\" he replied. \"According to your wishes, I kept the\r\nrent for you, but during your absence there was a sudden call upon me\r\nfor money, and I could not refuse to advance it. I regret it exceedingly\r\nif it puts you to inconvenience. I had hoped to have made it all right\r\nbefore you returned, but I have not had time. I can only promise you\r\nthat you shall be paid all that I can put by each week till I have\r\ncleared off my debt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's all very fine,\" said Mrs. Bryant. \"But I don't think much of\r\npromises.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry to hear it,\" he answered gravely.\r\n\r\nShe looked hard at him, and said: \"I did think you were quite the\r\ngentleman, Mr. Thorne. I didn't think you'd have served me so.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Percival. \"I assure you I'm very sorry. If I could explain\r\nthe whole affair to you, you would see that I am not to blame. But,\r\nunluckily, I can't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I don't want any explanations: I wouldn't give a thank-you for a\r\ncartload of 'em. Nobody ever is to blame who has the explaining of a\r\nthing, if it's ever so rascally a job.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very sorry,\" he repeated. \"But I can only say that you shall be\r\npaid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I dare say! Look here, Mr. Thorne: I've heard that sort of thing\r\nscores of times. There's always been a sudden call for money; it's\r\nalways something that never happened before, and it isn't ever to happen\r\nagain; and it's always going to be paid back at once, but there's not\r\none in a hundred who does pay it. Once you begin that sort of thing--\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll find me that hundredth one,\" said Percival.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. To hear them talk you'd say each one was one in a thousand, at\r\nleast. But I'd like you to know that though I'm a widow woman I'm not to\r\nbe robbed and put upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Bryant\"--Percival's strong voice silenced her querulous tones--\"no\r\none wants to rob you. Please to remember that it was entirely of your\r\nown free-will that you trusted me with the money.\"\r\n\r\n\"More fool I!\" Mrs. Bryant ejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"It was to oblige you that I took charge of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a pretty mess I've made of it! It had better have gone so as to be\r\nsome pleasure to my own flesh and blood, instead of your spending it in\r\nsome way you're ashamed to own.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you had been here to receive it, it would have been ready for you,\"\r\nPercival went on, ignoring her last speech. \"As it is, it has waited all\r\nthese weeks for you. It isn't unreasonable that it should wait a little\r\nlonger for me.\"\r\n\r\nShe muttered something to the effect that there was justice to be had,\r\nthough he didn't seem to think it.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes,\" he said, resting his arm on the chimney-piece, \"there's the\r\ncounty court or something of that kind. By all means go to the county\r\ncourt if you like. But I see no occasion for discussing the matter any\r\nmore beforehand.\"\r\n\r\nHis calmness had its effect upon her. She didn't want any\r\nunpleasantness, she said.\r\n\r\n\"Neither do I,\" he replied: \"I do not see why there need be any. If I\r\nlive you will be paid, and that before very long. If I should happen to\r\ndie first, I have a friend who will settle my affairs for me, and you\r\nwill be no loser.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bryant suggested that it might be pleasanter for all parties if Mr.\r\nThorne were to apply to his friend at once. She thought very likely\r\nthere were little bills about in the town--gentlemen very often had\r\nlittle bills--and if there were any difficulties--gentlemen so often got\r\ninto difficulties--it was so much better to have things settled and make\r\na fresh start. She had no doubt that Mr. Lisle would be very willing.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Lisle!\" Percival exclaimed. \"Do you suppose for one moment I should\r\nask Mr. Lisle?\"\r\n\r\nStartled at his vehemence, Mrs. Bryant begged pardon, and substituted\r\n\"the gentleman\" for \"Mr. Lisle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, no,\" said Percival. \"I prefer to manage my own affairs in my\r\nown way. If I live I will not apply to any one. But if I must go to my\r\ngrave owing five or six weeks' rent to one or other of you, I assure you\r\nmost solemnly, Mrs. Bryant, that I will owe it to my friend.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm had subsided into subdued grumblings. Their purport was,\r\napparently, that Mrs. Bryant liked lodgers who paid regular, and as for\r\nthose who didn't, they would have to leave, and she wished them to know\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Does that mean that you wish me to go?\" the young man demanded with the\r\nreadiness which was too much for his landlady. \"I'll go to-night if you\r\nlike. Do you wish it?\" There was an air of such promptitude about him as\r\nhe spoke that Mrs. Bryant half expected to see him vanish then and\r\nthere. She had by no means made up her mind that she did wish to lose a\r\nlodger who had been so entirely satisfactory up to that time. And she\r\npreferred to keep her debtor within reach; so she drew back a little and\r\nqualified what she had said.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Percival, \"just as you please.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bryant only hoped it wouldn't occur again. The tempest of her\r\nwrath showed fearful symptoms of dissolving in a shower of tears. \"You\r\ndon't know what work I have to make both ends meet, Mr. Thorne,\" she\r\nsaid, \"nor how hard it is to get one's own, let alone keeping it. I do\r\nassure you, Mr. Thorne, me and Lydia might go in silks every day of our\r\nlives, and needn't so much as soil our fingers with the work of the\r\nhouse, if we had all we rightly should have. But there are folks who\r\ncall themselves honest who don't think any harm of taking a widow\r\nwoman's rooms and getting behindhand with the rent, running up an\r\naccount for milk and vegetables and the like by the week together; and\r\nthere's the bell ringing all day, as you may say, with the bills coming\r\nin, and one's almost driven out of one's wits with the worry of it all,\r\nlet alone the loss, which is hard to bear. Oh, I do hope, Mr. Thorne,\r\nthat it won't occur again!\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't very likely,\" said Percival, privately thinking that suicide\r\nwould be preferable to an existence in which such interviews with his\r\nlandlady should be of frequent occurrence. Pity, irritation, disgust,\r\npride and humiliation made up a state of feeling which was overshadowed\r\nby a horrible fear that Mrs. Bryant would begin to weep before he could\r\nget rid of her. He watched her with ever-increasing uneasiness while she\r\nattempted to give him a receipt for the money he had paid. She began by\r\nwiping her spectacles, but her hand trembled so much that she let them\r\nfall, and she, Percival and the candle were all on the floor together,\r\nassisting one another in the search for them. The rusty cap was\r\nperilously near the flame more than once, which was a cause of fresh\r\nanxiety on his part. And when she was once more established at the\r\ntable, writing a word or two and then wiping her eyes, it was\r\ndistracting to discover that the receipt-stamp, which Mrs. Bryant had\r\nbrought with her, and which she was certain she had laid on the table,\r\nhad mysteriously disappeared. It seemed to Percival that he spent at\r\nleast a quarter of an hour hunting for that stamp. In reality about two\r\nminutes elapsed before it was found sticking to Mrs. Bryant's damp\r\npocket handkerchief. It was removed thence with great care, clinging to\r\nher fingers by the way, after which it showed a not unnatural\r\ndisinclination to adhere to the paper. But even that difficulty was at\r\nlast overcome: a shaky signature and a date were laboriously penned, and\r\nPercival's heart beat high as he received the completed document.\r\n\r\nAnd then--Mrs. Bryant laid down the pen, took off her spectacles, shook\r\nher pocket handkerchief and deliberately burst into tears.\r\n\r\nPercival was in despair. Of course he knew perfectly well that he was\r\nnot a heartless brute, but equally of course he felt that he must be a\r\nheartless brute as he stood by while Mrs. Bryant wept copiously. Of\r\ncourse he begged her to calm herself, and of course a long-drawn sob was\r\nher only answer. All at once there was a knock at the door. \"Come in,\"\r\nsaid Percival, feeling that matters could not possibly be worse. It\r\nopened, and Lydia stood on the threshold, staring at the pair in much\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I never!\" she said; and turning toward Percival she eyed him\r\nsuspiciously, as if she thought he might have been knocking the old lady\r\nabout. \"And pray what may be the meaning of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Bryant isn't quite herself this evening, I am afraid,\" said\r\nPercival, feeling that his reply was very feeble. \"And we have had a\r\nlittle business to settle which was not quite satisfactory.\"\r\n\r\nAt the word \"business\" Lydia stepped forward, and her surprise gave\r\nplace to an expression of half incredulous amusement--Percival would\r\nalmost have said of delight.\r\n\r\n\"What! ain't the money all right?\" she said. \"You don't say so! Well,\r\nma, you _have_ been clever this time, haven't you? Oh I suppose you\r\nthought I didn't know what you were after when you were so careful about\r\nnot bothering me with the accounts? Lor! I knew fast enough. Don't you\r\nfeel proud of yourself for having managed it so well?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Bryant wept. Percival, not having a word to say, preserved a\r\ndignified silence.\r\n\r\n\"Come along, ma: I dare say Mr. Thorne has had about enough of this,\"\r\nLydia went on, coolly examining the paper which lay on the table. She\r\narrived at the total. \"Oh that's it, is it? Well, I like that, I do!\r\nSome people are so clever, ain't they? So wonderfully sharp they can't\r\ntrust their own belongings! I do like that! Come along, ma.\" And Lydia\r\nseconded her summons with such energetic action that it seemed to\r\nPercival that she absolutely swept the old lady out of the room, and\r\nthat the wet handkerchief, the rusty black gown and the bugle-sprinkled\r\nhead-dress vanished in a whirlwind, with a sound of shrill laughter on\r\nthe stairs.\r\n\r\nFor a moment his heart leapt with a sudden sense of relief and freedom,\r\nbut only for a moment. Then he flung himself into his arm-chair, utterly\r\ndejected and sickened.\r\n\r\nShould he be subject to this kind of thing all his life long? If he\r\nshould chance to be ill and unable to work, how could he live for any\r\nlength of time on his paltry savings? And debt would mean _this_! He\r\nneed not even be ill. He remembered how he broke his arm once when he\r\nwas a lad. Suppose he broke his arm now--a bit of orange-peel in the\r\nstreet might do it--or suppose he hurt the hand with which he wrote?\r\n\r\nAnd this was the life which he might ask Judith to share with him! She\r\nmight endure Mrs. Bryant's scolding and Lydia's laughter, and pinch and\r\nsave as he was forced to do, and grow weary and careworn and sick at\r\nheart. No, God forbid! And yet--and yet--was she not enduring as bad or\r\nworse in that hateful school?\r\n\r\nOh for his dream! One week of life and love, and then swift exit from a\r\nhideous world, where Mrs. Bryant and Miss Macgregor and Lydia and all\r\nhis other nightmares might do their worst and fight their hardest in\r\ntheir ugly struggle for existence!\r\n\r\nPercival had achieved something of a victory in his encounter with his\r\nlandlady. His manner had been calm and fairly easy, and from first to\r\nlast she had been more conscious of his calmness than Percival was\r\nhimself. She had been silenced, not coaxed and flattered as she often\r\nwas by unfortunate lodgers whose ready money ran short. Indeed, she had\r\nbeen defied, and when she recovered herself a little she declared that\r\nshe had never seen any one so stuck up as Mr. Thorne. This was unkind,\r\nafter he had gone down on his knees to look for her spectacles.\r\n\r\nBut if Percival had conquered, his was but a barren victory. He fancied\r\nthat an unwonted tone of deference crept into his voice when he gave his\r\norders. He was afraid of Mrs. Bryant. He faced Lydia bravely, but he\r\nwinced in secret at the recollection of her laughter. He very nearly\r\nstarved himself lest mother or daughter should be able to say, \"Mr.\r\nThorne might have remembered his debts before he ordered this or that.\"\r\nHe had paid Lisle's bill at Mr. Robinson's, but he could not forget his\r\nown, and he walked past the house daily with his head high, feeling\r\nhimself a miserable coward.\r\n\r\nThere was a draper's shop close to it, and as he went by one day he saw\r\na little pony chaise at the door. A girl of twelve or thirteen sat in it\r\nlistlessly holding the reins and looking up and down the street. It was\r\na great field-day for the Brenthill volunteers, and their band came\r\nround a corner not a dozen yards away and suddenly struck up a\r\ntriumphant march. The pony, although as quiet a little creature as you\r\ncould easily find, was startled. If it had been a wooden rocking-horse\r\nit might not have minded, but any greater sensibility must have received\r\na shock. The girl uttered a cry of alarm, but there was no cause for it.\r\nPercival, who was close at hand, stepped to the pony's head, a lady\r\nrushed out of the shop, the band went by in a tempest of martial music,\r\na crowd of boys and girls filled the roadway and disappeared as quickly\r\nas they came. It was all over in a minute. Percival, who was coaxing the\r\npony as he stood, was warmly thanked.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing to thank me for,\" he said. \"That band was enough to\r\nfrighten anything, but the pony seems a gentle little thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" the lady replied. \"But you see, the driver was very\r\ninexperienced, and we really are very much obliged to you, Mr. Thorne.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked at her in blank amazement. Had some one from his former life\r\nsuddenly arisen to claim acquaintance with him? He glanced from her to\r\nthe girl, but recognized neither. \"You know me?\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe smiled: \"You don't know me, I dare say. I am Mrs. Barton. I saw you\r\none day when I was just coming away after calling on Miss Lisle.\" She\r\nwatched the hero of her romance as she spoke. His dark face lighted up\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n\"I have often heard Miss Lisle speak of you and of your kindness,\" he\r\nsaid. \"Do you ever see her now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes. She comes to give Janie her music-lesson every Wednesday\r\nafternoon.--We couldn't do without Miss Lisle, could we, Janie?\" The\r\ngirl was shy and did not speak, but a broad smile overspread her face.\r\n\r\n\"I had no idea she still came to you. Do you know how she gets on at\r\nMiss Macgregor's?\" he asked eagerly. \"Is she well? I saw her at church\r\none day, and I thought she was pale.\"\r\n\r\n\"She says she is well,\" Mrs. Barton replied. \"But I am not very fond of\r\nMiss Macgregor myself: no one ever stays there very long.\" A shopman\r\ncame out and put a parcel into the chaise. Mrs. Barton took the reins.\r\n\"I shall tell Miss Lisle you asked after her,\" she said as with a bow\r\nand cordial smile she drove off.\r\n\r\nIt was Monday, and Percival's mind was speedily made up. He would see\r\nJudith Lisle on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nTuesday was a remarkably long day, but Wednesday came at last, and he\r\nobtained permission to leave the office earlier than usual. He knew the\r\nstreet in which Mrs. Barton lived, and had taken some trouble to\r\nascertain the number, so that he could stroll to and fro at a safe\r\ndistance, commanding a view of the door.\r\n\r\nHe had time to study the contents of a milliner's window: it was the\r\nonly shop near at hand, and even that pretended not to be a shop, but\r\nrather a private house, where some one had accidentally left a bonnet or\r\ntwo, a few sprays of artificial flowers and an old lady's cap in the\r\nfront room. He had abundant leisure to watch No. 51 taking in a supply\r\nof coals, and No. 63 sending away a piano. He sauntered to and fro so\r\nlong, with a careless assumption of unconsciousness how time was\r\npassing, that a stupid young policeman perceived that he was not an\r\nordinary passer-by. Astonished and delighted at his own penetration, he\r\nbegan to saunter and watch him, trying to make out which house he\r\nintended to favor with a midnight visit. Percival saw quite a procession\r\nof babies in perambulators being wheeled home by their nurses after\r\ntheir afternoon airing, and he discovered that the nurse at No. 57 had a\r\nflirtation with a soldier. But at last the door of No. 69 opened, a slim\r\nfigure came down the steps, and he started to meet it, leisurely, but\r\nwith a sudden decision and purpose in his walk. The young policeman saw\r\nthe meeting: the whole affair became clear to him--why, he had done that\r\nsort of thing himself--and he hurried off rather indignantly, feeling\r\nthat he had wasted his time, and that the supposed burglar had not\r\nbehaved at all handsomely.\r\n\r\nAnd Percival went forward and held out his hand to Judith, but found\r\nthat even the most commonplace greeting stuck in his throat somehow. She\r\nlooked quickly up at him, but she too was silent, and he walked a few\r\nsteps by her side before he said, \"I did not know what day you were\r\ngoing away.\"\r\n\r\nThe rest of the conversation followed in a swift interchange of question\r\nand reply, as if to make up for that pause.\r\n\r\n\"No, but I thought I should be sure to have a chance of saying\r\ngood-bye.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I was out. I was very sorry when I came home and found that you\r\nwere gone. But since we have met again, it doesn't matter now, does it?\"\r\nhe said with a smile. \"How do you get on at Miss Macgregor's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, very well,\" she answered. \"It will do for the present.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Miss Crawford?\"\r\n\r\n\"She will not see me nor hear from me. She is ill and low-spirited, and\r\nMrs. Barton tells me that a niece has come to look after her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that rather a good thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: I don't like it. I saw one or two of those nieces--there are seven\r\nof them--great vulgar, managing women. I can't bear to think of my dear\r\nlittle Miss Crawford being bullied and nursed by Miss Price. She\r\ncouldn't endure them, I know, only she was so fond of their mother.\"\r\n\r\nPercival changed the subject: \"So you go to Mrs. Barton's still? I\r\ndidn't know that till last Monday.\"\r\n\r\n\"When you rescued Janie from imminent peril. Oh, I have heard,\" said\r\nJudith with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Please to describe me as risking my own life in the act. It would be a\r\npity not to make me heroic while you are about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Janie would readily believe it. She measures her danger by her terror,\r\nwhich was great. But she is a dear, good child, and it is such a\r\npleasure to me to go there every week!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Then you are not happy at Miss Macgregor's?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, not very. But it might be much worse. And I am mercenary enough\r\nto think about the money I earn at Mrs. Barton's,\" said Judith. \"I don't\r\nmind telling you now that Bertie left two or three little bills unpaid\r\nwhen he went away, and I was very anxious about them. But, luckily, they\r\nwere small.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mind telling me now. Are they paid, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I have not heard of any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"You paid them out of your earnings?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. You understand me, don't you, Mr. Thorne? Bertie and I were\r\ntogether then, and I could not take Emmeline's money to pay our debts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I had saved a little. It is all right now, since they are all paid.\r\nI fancied there would be some more to come in, but it seems not, so I\r\nhave a pound or two to spare, and I feel quite rich.\"\r\n\r\nIt struck Percival that Judith had managed better than he had. \"Do you\r\never hear from him?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Mr. Nash has forgiven them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Already?\"\r\n\r\nJudith nodded: \"He has, though I thought he never would. Bertie\r\nunderstood him better.\"\r\n\r\n(The truth was, that she had taken impotent rage for strength of\r\npurpose. Mr. Nash was aware that he had neglected his daughter, and was\r\nanxious to stifle the thought by laying the blame on every one else. And\r\nBertie was quicker than Judith was in reading character when it was on\r\nhis own level.)\r\n\r\n\"He has forgiven them,\" Percival repeated with a smile. \"Well, Bertie is\r\na lucky fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"So is my father lucky, if that is luck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He has written to me and to my aunt Lisle--at Rookleigh, you know.\r\nHe has taken another name, and it seems he is getting on and making\r\nmoney: _he_ wanted to send me some too. And my aunt is angry with me\r\nbecause I would not go to her. She has given me two months to make up my\r\nmind in.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will not go?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot leave Brenthill,\" said Judith. \"She is more than half inclined\r\nto forgive Bertie too. So I am alone; and yet I am right.\" She uttered\r\nthe last words with lingering sadness.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt,\" Percival answered. They were walking slowly through a quiet\r\nback street, with a blank wall on one side. \"Still, it is hard,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nThere was something so simple and tender in his tone that Judith looked\r\nup and met his eyes. She might have read his words in them even if he\r\nhad not spoken. \"Don't pity me, Mr. Thorne,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Why not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, because--I hardly know why. I can't stand it when any one is kind\r\nto me, or sorry for me, sometimes at Mrs. Barton's. I don't know how to\r\nbear it. But it does not matter much, for I get braver and braver when\r\npeople are hard and cold. I really don't mind that half as much as you\r\nwould think, so you see you needn't pity me. In fact, you mustn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, I think I must,\" said Percival. \"More than before.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" she answered, hurriedly. \"Don't say it, don't look it, don't\r\neven let me think you do it in your heart. Tell me about yourself. You\r\nlisten to me, you ask about me, but you say nothing of what you are\r\ndoing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Working.\" There was a moment's hesitation. \"And dreaming,\" he added.\r\n\r\n\"But you have been ill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have not been ill? Then you are ill. What makes you so pale?\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed: \"Am I pale?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you look tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"My work is wearisome sometimes.\"\r\n\r\n\"More so than it was?\" she questioned anxiously. \"You used not to look\r\nso tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you think that a wearisome thing must grow more wearisome merely\r\nby going on?\"\r\n\r\n\"But is that all? Isn't there anything else the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps there is,\" he allowed. \"There are little worries of course, but\r\nshall I tell you what is the great thing that is the matter with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"I miss you, Judith.\"\r\n\r\nThe color spread over her face like a rosy dawn. Her eyes were fixed on\r\nthe pavement, and yet they looked as if they caught a glimpse of Eden.\r\nBut Percival could not see that. \"You miss me?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" He had forgotten his hesitation and despair. He had outstripped\r\nthem, had left them far behind, and his words sprang to his lips with a\r\nglad sense of victory and freedom. \"Must I miss you always?\" he said.\r\n\"Will you not come back to me, Judith? My work could never be wearisome\r\nthen when I should feel that I was working for you. There would be long\r\nto wait, no doubt, and then a hard life, a poor home. What have I to\r\noffer you? But will you come?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at him: \"Do you really want me, or is it that you are\r\nsorry for me and want to help me? Are you sure it isn't that? We Lisles\r\nhave done you harm enough: I won't do you a worse wrong still.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will do me the worst wrong of all if you let such fears and fancies\r\nstand between you and me,\" said Percival. \"Do you not know that I love\r\nyou? You must decide as your own heart tells you. But don't doubt me.\"\r\n\r\nShe laid her hand lightly on his arm: \"Forgive me, Percival.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so those two passed together into the Eden which she had seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nHOW THE SUN ROSE IN GLADNESS, AND SET IN THE VALLEY OF THE SHADOW OF\r\nDEATH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wednesday which was so white a day for Judith and Percival had\r\ndawned brightly at Fordborough. Sissy, opening her eyes on the radiant\r\nbeauty of the morning, sprang up with an exclamation of delight. The\r\npreceding day had been gray and uncertain, but this was golden and\r\ncloudless. A light breeze tossed the acacia-boughs and showed flashes of\r\nblue between the quivering sprays. The dew was still hanging on the\r\nclustered white roses which climbed to her open window, and the birds\r\nwere singing among the leaves as if they were running races in a\r\nheadlong rapture of delight. Sissy did not sing, but she said to\r\nherself, \"Oh, how glad the Latimers must be!\"\r\n\r\nShe was right, for at a still earlier hour the Latimer girls had been\r\nflying in and out of their respective rooms in a perfectly aimless,\r\njoyous, childishly happy fashion, like a flock of white pigeons. And the\r\nsum of their conversation was simply this: \"Oh, what a day! what a\r\nglorious day!\" Yet it sufficed for a Babel of bird-like voices. At last\r\none more energetic than the rest, in her white dressing-gown and with\r\nher hair hanging loose, flew down the long oak-panelled corridor and\r\nknocked with might and main at her brother's door: \"Walter! Walter!\r\nwake up! do! You said it would rain, and it doesn't rain! It is a\r\n_lovely_ morning! Oh, Walter!\"\r\n\r\nWalter responded briefly to the effect that he had been awake since half\r\nafter three, and was aware of the fact.\r\n\r\nHenry Hardwicke, who had been to the river for an early swim, stopped to\r\ndiscuss the weather with a laborer who was plodding across the fields.\r\nThe old man looked at the blue sky with an air of unutterable wisdom,\r\nmade some profound remarks about the quarter in which the wind was,\r\nadded a local saying or two bearing on the case, and summed up to the\r\neffect that it was a fine day.\r\n\r\nCaptain Fothergill had no particular view from his window, but he\r\ninquired at an early hour what the weather was like.\r\n\r\nAshendale Priory was a fine old ruin belonging to the Latimers, and\r\nabout six miles from Latimer's Court. Sissy Langton had said one day\r\nthat she often passed it in her rides, but had never been into it.\r\nWalter Latimer was astonished, horrified and delighted all at once, and\r\nvowed that she must see it, and should see it without delay. This\r\nWednesday had been fixed for an excursion there, but the project was\r\nnearly given up on account of the weather. As late as the previous\r\nafternoon the question was seriously debated at the Court by a council\r\ncomposed of Walter and three of his sisters. One of the members was sent\r\nto look at the barometer. She reported that it had gone up in the most\r\nextraordinary manner since luncheon.\r\n\r\nThe announcement was greeted with delight, but it was discovered late\r\nthat evening that Miss Latimer had had a happy thought. Fearing that the\r\nbarometer would be utterly ruined by the shaking and tapping which it\r\nunderwent, she had screwed it up to a height at which her younger\r\nbrothers and sisters could not wish to disturb it, had gone into the\r\nvillage, and had forgotten all about it. There was general dismay and\r\nmuch laughter.\r\n\r\n\"It will rain,\" said Walter: \"it will certainly rain. I thought it was\r\nvery queer. Well, it is too late to do anything now. We must just wait\r\nand see what happens.\"\r\n\r\nAnd behold the morrow had come, the clouds were gone, and it was a day\r\nin a thousand, a very queen of days.\r\n\r\nThe party started for Ashendale, some riding, some driving, waking the\r\nquiet green lanes with a happy tumult of wheels and horse-hoofs and\r\nlaughing voices. Captain Fothergill contrived to be near Miss Langton,\r\nand to talk in a fashion which made her look down once or twice when she\r\nhad encountered the eagerness of his dark eyes. The words he said might\r\nhave been published by the town-crier. But that functionary could not\r\nhave reproduced the tone and manner which rendered them significant,\r\nthough Sissy hardly knew the precise amount of meaning they were\r\nintended to convey. She was glad when the tower of the priory rose above\r\nthe trees. So was Walter Latimer, who had been eying the back of\r\nFothergill's head or the sharply-cut profile which was turned so\r\nfrequently toward Miss Langton, and who was firmly persuaded that the\r\ncaptain ought to be shot.\r\n\r\nAshendale Priory was built nearly at the bottom of a hill. Part of it,\r\nclose by the gateway, was a farmhouse occupied by a tenant of the\r\nLatimers. His wife, a pleasant middle-aged woman, came out to meet them\r\nas they dismounted, and a rosy daughter of sixteen or seventeen lingered\r\nshyly in the little garden, which was full to overflowing of\r\nold-fashioned flowers and humming with multitudes of bees. The hot sweet\r\nfragrance of the crowded borders made Sissy say that it was like the\r\nvery heart of summer-time.\r\n\r\n\"A place to recollect and dream of on a November day,\" said Fothergill.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, don't talk of November now! I hate it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want November, I assure you,\" he replied. \"Why cannot this last\r\nfor ever?\"\r\n\r\n\"The weather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Much more than the weather. Do you suppose I should only remember that\r\nit was a fine day?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, the place too?\" said Sissy. \"It is beautiful, but I think you\r\nwould soon get tired of Ashendale, Captain Fothergill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you?\" he said in a low voice, looking at her with the eyes which\r\nseemed to draw hers to meet them. \"Try me and see which will be tired\r\nfirst.\" And, without giving her time to answer, he went on: \"Couldn't\r\nyou be content with Ashendale?\"\r\n\r\n\"For always? I don't think I could--not for all my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, the perfect place is yet to find,\" said Fothergill. \"And\r\nhow charming it must be!\"\r\n\r\n\"If one should ever find it!\" said Sissy.\r\n\r\n\"One?\" Fothergill looked at her again. \"Not _one_! Won't you hope we may\r\nboth find it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like the people who hunted for the Earthly Paradise,\" said Sissy\r\nhurriedly. \"Look! they are going to the ruins.\" And she hastened to join\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\nLatimer noticed that she evidently, and very properly, would not permit\r\nFothergill to monopolize her, but seemed rather to avoid the fellow. To\r\nhis surprise, however, he found that there was no better fortune for\r\nhimself. Fothergill had brought a sailor cousin, a boy of nineteen,\r\ncurly-haired, sunburnt and merry, with a sailor's delight in flirtation\r\nand fun, and Archibald Carroll fixed his violent though temporary\r\naffections on Sissy the moment he was introduced to her at the priory.\r\nTo Latimer's great disgust, Sissy distinctly encouraged him, and the two\r\nwent off together during the progress round the ruins. There were some\r\nold fish-ponds to be seen, with swans and reeds and water-lilies, and\r\nwhen they were tired of scrambling about the gray walls there was a\r\nlittle copse hard by, the perfection of sylvan scenery on a small scale.\r\nThe party speedily dispersed, rambling where their fancy led them, and\r\nwere seen no more till the hour which had been fixed for dinner. Mrs.\r\nLatimer meanwhile chose a space of level turf, superintended the\r\nunpacking of hampers, and when the wanderers came dropping in by twos\r\nand threes from all points of the compass, professing unbounded\r\nreadiness to help in the preparations, there was nothing left for them\r\nto do. Among the latest were Sissy and her squire, a radiant pair. She\r\nwas charmed with her saucy sailor-boy, who had no serious intentions or\r\nhopes, who would most likely be gone on the morrow, and who asked\r\nnothing more than to be happy with her through that happy summer day.\r\nPeople and things were apt to grow perplexing and sad when they came\r\ninto her every-day life, but here was a holiday companion, arrived as\r\nunexpectedly as if he were created for her holiday, with no such thing\r\nas an afterthought about the whole affair.\r\n\r\nLatimer sulked, but his rival smiled, when the two young people arrived.\r\nFor--thus argued Raymond Fothergill, with a vanity which was so calm, so\r\nclear, so certain that it sounded like reason itself--it was not\r\npossible that Sissy Langton preferred Carroll to himself. Even had it\r\nbeen Latimer or Hardwicke! But Carroll--no! Therefore she used the one\r\ncousin merely to avoid the other. But why did she wish to avoid him? He\r\nremembered her blushes, her shyness, the eyes that sank before his own,\r\nand he answered promptly that she feared him. He triumphed in the\r\nthought. He had contended against a gentle indifference on Sissy's part,\r\ntill, having heard rumors of a bygone love-affair, he had suspected the\r\nexistence of an unacknowledged constancy. Then what did this fear mean?\r\nIt was obviously the self-distrust of a heart unwilling to yield,\r\nclinging to its old loyalty, yet aware of a new weakness--seeking safety\r\nin flight because unable to resist. Fothergill was conscious of power,\r\nand could wait with patience. (It would have been unreasonable to expect\r\nhim to spend an equal amount of time and talent in accounting for Miss\r\nLangton's equally evident avoidance of young Latimer. Besides, that was\r\na simple matter. He bored her, no doubt.)\r\n\r\nWhen the business of eating and drinking was drawing to a close, little\r\nEdith Latimer, the youngest of the party, began to arrange a lapful of\r\nwild flowers which she had brought back from her ramble. Hardwicke, who\r\nhad helped her to collect them, handed them to her one by one.\r\n\r\nA green tuft which he held up caught Sissy's eye. \"Why, Edie, what have\r\nyou got there?\" she said. \"Is that maiden-hair spleenwort? Where did\r\nyou find it?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a crack in the wall: there's a lot more,\" the child answered; and at\r\nthe same moment Hardwicke said, \"Shall I get you some?\"\r\n\r\n\"No: I'll get some,\" exclaimed Archie, who was lying at Sissy's feet.\r\n\"Miss Langton would rather I got it for her, I know.\"\r\n\r\nSissy arched her brows.\r\n\r\n\"She has so much more confidence in me,\" Archie explained. \"Please give\r\nme a leaf of that stuff, Miss Latimer: I want to see what it's like.\"\r\n\r\n\"My confidence is rather misplaced, I'm afraid, if you don't know what\r\nyou are going to look for.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit misplaced. You know very well I shall have a sort of instinct\r\nwhich will take me straight to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me! It hasn't any smell, you know,\" said Sissy with perfect\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how cruel!\" said Carroll, \"withering up my delicate feelings with\r\nthoughtless sarcasm! Smell? no! My what-d'ye-call-it--sympathy--will\r\ntell me which it is. My heart will beat faster as I approach it. But\r\nI'll have that leaf all the same, please.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it might be as well to know where to look for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"We found it in the ruins--in the wall of the refectory,\" said\r\nHardwicke.\r\n\r\nSissy looked doubtful, but Carroll exclaimed, \"Oh, I know! That's where\r\nthe old fellows used to dine, isn't it? And had sermons read to them all\r\nthe time.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a bore!\" some one suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I don't know about that,\" said Archie. \"Sermons always are awful\r\nbores, ain't they? But I don't think I should mind 'em so much if I\r\nmight eat my dinner all the time.\" He stopped with a comical look of\r\nalarm. \"I say, we haven't got any parsons here, have we?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Fothergill smiling. \"We've brought the surgeon, in case of\r\nbroken bones, but we've left the chaplain at home. So you may give us\r\nthe full benefit of your opinions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought there wasn't one,\" Archie remarked, looking up at Sissy,\r\n\"because nobody said grace. Or don't you ever say grace at a picnic?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you do,\" Sissy replied. \"Unless it were a very Low Church\r\npicnic perhaps. I don't know, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Makes a difference being out of doors, I suppose,\" said Archie,\r\nexamining the little frond which Edith had given him. \"And this is what\r\nyou call maiden-hair?\"\r\n\r\n\"What should you call it?\"\r\n\r\n\"A libel,\" he answered promptly. \"Maiden--hair, indeed! Why, I can see\r\nsome a thousand times prettier quite close by. What can you want with\r\nthis? _You_ can't see the other, but I'll tell you what it's like. It's\r\nthe most beautiful brown, with gold in it, and it grows in little\r\nripples and waves and curls, and nothing ever was half so fine before,\r\nand it catches just the edge of a ray of sunshine--oh, don't move your\r\nhead!--and looks like a golden glory--\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" said Sissy. \"Then I'm afraid it's very rough.\"\r\n\r\n\"--And the least bit of it is worth a cartload of this green rubbish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! But you see it is very much harder to get.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is,\" said Archie. \"But exchange is no robbery, they say.\r\nSuppose I go and dig up some of this, don't you think--remembering that\r\nI am a poor sailor-boy, going to be banished from 'England, home and\r\nbeauty,' and that I shall most likely be drowned on my next\r\nvoyage--don't you think--\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that, on your own showing, you must get me at least a cartload\r\nof the other before you have the face to finish that sentence.\"\r\n\r\n\"A cartload! I feel like a prince in a fairy-tale. And what would you do\r\nwith it all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I really hardly know what I should do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There now!\" said Archie. \"And I could tell you in a moment what I would\r\ndo with mine if you gave it me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, but I could tell you that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, then.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would fold it up carefully in a neat little bit of paper, but you\r\nwould not write anything on it, because you would not like it to look\r\nbusiness-like. Besides, you couldn't possibly forget. And a few months\r\nhence you will have lost your heart to some foreign young lady--I don't\r\nknow where you are going--and you would find the little packet in your\r\ndesk, and wonder who gave it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how little you know me!\" Archie exclaimed, and sank back on the\r\nturf in a despairing attitude. But a moment later he began to laugh, and\r\nsat up again. \"There _was_ a bit once,\" he said confidentially, \"and for\r\nthe life of me I couldn't think whose it could be. There were two or\r\nthree girls I knew it couldn't possibly belong to, but that didn't help\r\nme very far. That lock of hair quite haunted me. See what it is to have\r\nsuch susceptible feelings! I used to look at it a dozen times a day, and\r\nI couldn't sleep at night for thinking of it. At last I said to myself,\r\n'I don't care whose it is: she was a nice, dear girl anyhow, and I'm\r\nsure she wouldn't like to think that she bothered me in this way.' So I\r\nconsigned it to a watery grave. I felt very melancholy when it went, I\r\ncan tell you, and if my own hair had been a reasonable length I'd have\r\nsent a bit of it overboard with hers, just for company's sake. But I'd\r\nhad a fever, and I was cropped like a convict, so I couldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"You tell that little story very nicely,\" said Sissy when he paused. \"Do\r\nyou always mention it when you ask--\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, no,\" Archie exclaimed. \"I thought _you_ would take it as it was\r\nmeant--as the greatest possible compliment to yourself. But I suppose\r\nit's my destiny to be misunderstood. Don't you see that I _couldn't_\r\ntell that to any one unless I were quite sure that she was so much\r\nhigher, so altogether apart, that she never, never could get mixed up\r\nwith anybody else in my mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"She had better have some very particular sort of curliness in her hair\r\ntoo,\" said Sissy. \"Don't you think it would be safer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this is too much!\" he exclaimed. \"It's sport to you, evidently, but\r\nyou don't consider that it's death to me. I say, come away, and we'll\r\nlook for this green stuff.\"\r\n\r\nFothergill smiled, but Latimer's handsome face flushed. He had made a\r\ndozen attempts to supplant Carroll, and had been foiled by the laughing\r\npair. What was the use of being a good-looking fellow of six-and-twenty,\r\nhead of one of the county families and owner of Latimer's Court and\r\nAshendale, if he were to be set aside by a beggarly sailor-boy? What did\r\nFothergill mean by bringing his poor relations dragging after him where\r\nthey were not wanted? He sprang to his feet, and went away with long\r\nstrides to make violent love to the farmer's rosy little daughter. He\r\nknew that he meant nothing at all, and that he was filling the poor\r\nchild's head and heart with the vainest of hopes. He knew that he owed\r\nespecial respect and consideration to the daughter of his tenant, a man\r\nwho had dealt faithfully by him, and whose father and grandfather had\r\nheld Ashendale under the Latimers. He felt that he was acting meanly\r\neven while he kissed little Lucy by the red wall where the apricots were\r\nripening in the sun. And he had no overmastering passion for excuse:\r\nwhat did he care for little Lucy? He was doing wrong, and he was doing\r\nit _because_ it was wrong. He was in a fiercely antagonistic mood, and,\r\nas he could not fight Fothergill and Carroll, he fought with his own\r\nsense of truth and honor, for want of a better foe. And Lucy, conscious\r\nof her rosy prettiness, stood shyly pulling the lavender-heads in a glad\r\nbewilderment of vanity, wonder and delight, while Latimer's heart was\r\nfull of jealous anger. If Sissy Langton could amuse herself, so could\r\nhe.\r\n\r\nBut Sissy was too happily absorbed in her amusement to think of his. She\r\nhad avoided him, as she had avoided Captain Fothergill, from a sense of\r\ndanger. They were becoming too serious, too much in earnest, and she did\r\nnot want to be serious. So she went gayly across the grass, laughing at\r\nArchie because he would look on level ground for her maiden-hair\r\nspleenwort. They came to a small enclosure.\r\n\r\n\"Here you are!\" said Carroll. \"This is what somebody said was the\r\nrefectory. It makes one feel quite sad and sentimental only to think\r\nwhat a lot of jolly dinners have been eaten here. And nothing left of it\r\nall!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's your idea of sentiment, Mr. Carroll? It sounds to me as if you\r\nhadn't had enough to eat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I had plenty. But we ought to pledge each other in a cup of\r\nsack, or something of the kind. And a place like this ought at least to\r\nsmell deliciously of roast and boiled. Instead of which it might as well\r\nbe the chapel.\"\r\n\r\nSissy gazed up at the wall: \"There's some maiden-hair! How was it I\r\nnever saw it this morning? Surely, we came along the top and looked down\r\ninto this place.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Archie. \"That was the chapel we looked into. Didn't I say\r\nthey were just alike?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can easily get up there,\" she said. \"And you may stay down here\r\nif you like, and grow sentimental over the ghost of a dinner.\" And,\r\nlaughing, she darted up a steep ascent of turf, slackening her pace when\r\nshe came to a rough heap of fallen stones. Carroll was by her side\r\ndirectly, helping her. \"Why, this is prettier than where we went this\r\nmorning,\" she said when they reached the top: \"you see the whole place\r\nbetter. But it's narrower, I think. This is the west wall, isn't it? Oh,\r\nMr. Carroll, how much the sun has gone down already!\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish I were Moses, or whoever it was, to make it stop,\" said the boy:\r\n\"it would stay up there a good long time.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a black belt of shadow at the foot of the wall. Archie looked\r\ndown as if to measure its breadth. A little tuft of green caught his\r\neye, and stooping he pulled it from between the stones.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, how broken it is here! Doesn't it look as if a giant had taken a\r\ngreat bite out of it?\" Sissy exclaimed, at the same moment that he\r\ncalled after her, \"Is this right, Miss Langton?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned her head, and for a second's space he saw her bright face,\r\nher laughing, parted lips. Then there was a terrible cry, stretched\r\nhands at which he snatched instinctively but in vain, and a stone which\r\nslipped and fell heavily. He stumbled forward, and recovered himself\r\nwith an effort. There was blank space before him--and what below?\r\n\r\nArchie Carroll half scrambled down by the help of the ivy, half slid,\r\nand reached the ground. Thus, at the risk of his life, he gained half a\r\nminute, and spent it in kneeling on the grass--a yard away from that\r\nwhich he dared not touch--saying pitifully, \"Miss Langton! Oh, won't you\r\nspeak to me, Miss Langton?\"\r\n\r\nHe was in the shadow, but looking across the enclosure he faced a broken\r\ndoorway in the south-east corner. The ground sloped away a little, and\r\nthe arch opened into the stainless blue. A sound of footsteps made\r\nCarroll look up, and through the archway came Raymond Fothergill. He had\r\nheard the cry, he had outrun the rest, and, even in his blank\r\nbewilderment of horror, Archie shrank back scared at his cousin's\r\naspect. His brows and moustache were black as night against the\r\nunnatural whiteness of his face, which was like bleached wax. His eyes\r\nwere terrible. He seemed to reach the spot in an instant. Carroll saw\r\nhis hands on the stone which had fallen, and lay on her--O God!--or only\r\non her dress?\r\n\r\nFothergill's features contracted in sudden agony as he noted the\r\nhorribly twisted position in which she lay, but he stooped without a\r\nmoment's hesitation, and, lifting her gently, laid her on the turf,\r\nresting her head upon his knee. There was a strange contrast between the\r\ntenderness with which he supported her and the fierce anger of his face.\r\nOthers of the party came rushing on the scene in dismay and horror.\r\n\r\n\"Water!\" said Fothergill. \"Where's Anderson?\" (Anderson was the young\r\ndoctor.) \"Not here?\"\r\n\r\n\"He went by the fish-ponds with Evelyn,\" cried Edith suddenly: \"I saw\r\nhim.\" Hardwicke darted off.\r\n\r\n\"Curse him! Playing the fool when he's wanted more than he ever will be\r\nagain.--Mrs. Latimer!\"\r\n\r\nEdith rushed away to find her mother.\r\n\r\nSome one brought water, and held it while Fothergill, with his\r\ndisengaged hand, sprinkled the white face on his knee.\r\n\r\nWalter Latimer hurried round the corner. He held a pink rosebud, on\r\nwhich his fingers tightened unconsciously as he ran. Coming to the\r\nstaring group, he stopped aghast. \"Good God!\" he panted, \"what has\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\nFothergill dashed more water on the shut eyes and bright hair.\r\n\r\nLatimer looked from him to the others standing round: \"What has\r\nhappened?\"\r\n\r\nA hoarse voice spoke from the background: \"She fell.\" Archie Carroll had\r\nrisen from his knees, and, lifting one hand above his head, he pointed\r\nto the wall. Suddenly, he met Fothergill's eyes, and with a\r\nhalf-smothered cry he flung himself all along upon the grass and hid his\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"Fothergill! is she much hurt?\" cried Latimer. \"Is it serious?\"\r\n\r\nThe other did not look up. \"I cannot tell,\" he said, \"but I believe she\r\nis killed.\"\r\n\r\nLatimer uttered a cry: \"No! no! For God's sake don't say that! It can't\r\nbe!\"\r\n\r\nFothergill made no answer.\r\n\r\n\"It isn't possible!\" said Walter. But his glance measured the height of\r\nthe wall and rested on the stones scattered thickly below. The words\r\ndied on his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Is Anderson never coming?\" said some one else. Another messenger\r\nhurried off. Latimer stood as if rooted to the ground, gazing after him.\r\nAll at once he noticed the rose which he still held, and jerked it away\r\nwith a movement as of horror.\r\n\r\nThe last runner returned: \"Anderson and Hardwicke will be here directly:\r\nI saw them coming up the path from the fish-ponds. Here is Mrs.\r\nLatimer.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"FOTHERGILL! IS SHE MUCH HURT?\"--Page 682.]\r\n\r\nEdith ran through the archway first, eager and breathless. \"Here is\r\nmamma,\" she said, going straight to Raymond Fothergill with her tidings,\r\nand speaking softly as if Sissy were asleep. A little nod was his only\r\nanswer, and the girl stood gazing with frightened eyes at the drooping\r\nhead which he supported. Mrs. Latimer, Hardwicke and Anderson all\r\narrived together, and the group divided to make way for them. The first\r\nthing to be done was to carry Sissy to the farmhouse, and while they\r\nwere arranging this Edith felt two hands pressed lightly on her\r\nshoulders. She turned and confronted Harry Hardwicke.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" he said: \"do not disturb them now, but when they have taken her\r\nto the house, if you hear anything said, tell them that I have gone for\r\nDr. Grey, and as soon as I have sent him here I shall go on for Mrs.\r\nMiddleton. You understand?\" he added, for the child was looking at him\r\nwith her scared eyes, and had not spoken.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I will tell them. Oh, Harry! will she die?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if anything you and I can do will save her--will she, Edith?\" and\r\nHardwicke ran off to the stables for his horse. A man was there who\r\nsaddled it for him, and a rough farm-boy stood by and saw how the\r\ngentleman, while he waited, stroked the next one--a lady's horse, a\r\nchestnut--and how presently he turned his face away and laid his cheek\r\nfor a moment against the chestnut's neck. The boy thought it was a rum\r\ngo, and stood staring vacantly while Hardwicke galloped off on his\r\nterrible errand.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, they were carrying Sissy to the house. Fothergill was\r\nhelping, of course. Latimer had stood by irresolutely, half afraid, yet\r\nsecretly hoping for a word which would call him. But no one heeded him.\r\nEvelyn and Edith had hurried on to see that there was a bed on which she\r\ncould be laid, and the sad little procession followed them at a short\r\ndistance. The lookers-on straggled after it, an anxiously-whispering\r\ngroup, and as the last passed through the ruined doorway Archie Carroll\r\nlifted his head and glanced round. The wall, with its mosses and ivy,\r\nrose darkly above him--too terrible a presence to be faced alone. He\r\nsprang up, hurried out of the black belt of shadow and fled across the\r\nturf. He never looked back till he stood under the arch, but halting\r\nthere, within sight of his companions, he clasped a projection with one\r\nhand as if he were giddy, and turning his head gazed intently at the\r\ncrest of the wall. Every broken edge, every tuft of feathery grass,\r\nevery aspiring ivy-spray, stood sharply out against the sunny blue. The\r\nbreeze had gone down, and neither blade nor leaf stirred in the hot\r\nstillness of the air. There was the way by which they had gone up, there\r\nwas the ruinous gap which Sissy had said was like a giant's bite.\r\nArchie's grasp tightened on the stone as he looked. He might well feel\r\nstunned and dizzy, gazing thus across the hideous gulf which parted him\r\nfrom the moment when he stood upon the wall with Sissy Langton laughing\r\nby his side. Not till every detail was cruelly stamped upon his brain\r\ndid he leave the spot.\r\n\r\nBy that time they had carried Sissy in. Little Lucy had been close by,\r\nher rosy face blanched with horror, and had looked appealingly at\r\nLatimer as he went past. She wanted a kind word or glance, but the\r\ninnocent confiding look filled him with remorse and disgust. He would\r\nnot meet it: he stared straight before him. Lucy was overcome by\r\nconflicting emotions, went off into hysterics, and her mother had to be\r\ncalled away from the room where she was helping Mrs. Latimer. Walter\r\nfelt as if he could have strangled the pretty, foolish child to whom he\r\nhad been saying sweet things not half an hour before. The rose that he\r\nhad gathered for her was fastened in her dress, and the pink bud that\r\nshe had given him lay in its first freshness on the turf in the ruins.\r\n\r\nSome of the party waited in the garden. Fothergill stood in the shadow\r\nof the porch, silent and a little apart. Archie Carroll came up the\r\npath, but no one spoke to him, and he went straight to his cousin.\r\nLeaning against the woodwork, he opened his lips to speak, but was\r\nobliged to stop and clear his throat, for the words would not come. \"How\r\nis she?\" he said at last.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why do you look at me like that?\" said the boy desperately.\r\n\r\nFothergill slightly changed his position, and the light fell more\r\nstrongly on his face. \"I don't ever want to look at you again,\" he said\r\nwith quiet emphasis. \"You've done mischief enough to last your lifetime\r\nif you lived a thousand years.\"\r\n\r\n\"It wasn't my fault! Ray, it wasn't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whose, then?\" said Fothergill. \"Possibly you think it would have\r\nhappened if I had been there?\"\r\n\r\n\"They said that wall--\" the young fellow began.\r\n\r\n\"They didn't. No one told you to climb the most ruinous bit of the whole\r\nplace. And she didn't even know where the refectory was.\"\r\n\r\nCarroll groaned: \"Don't, Ray: I can't bear it! I shall kill myself!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you won't,\" said Fothergill. \"You'll go safe home to your people at\r\nthe rectory. No more of this.\"\r\n\r\nArchie hesitated, and then miserably dragged himself away. Fothergill\r\nretreated a little farther into the porch, and was almost lost in the\r\nshadow. No tidings, good or evil, had come from the inner room where\r\nSissy lay, but his state of mind was rather despairing than anxious.\r\nFrom the moment when he ran across the grass and saw her lying, a\r\nsenseless heap, at the foot of the wall, he had felt assured that she\r\nwas fatally injured. If he hoped at all it was an unconscious hope--a\r\nhope of which he never would be conscious until a cruel certainty killed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHis dominant feeling was anger. He had cared for this girl--cared for\r\nher so much that he had been astonished at himself for so caring--and he\r\nfelt that this love was the crown of his life. He did not for a moment\r\ndoubt that he would have won her. He had triumphed in anticipation, but\r\nDeath had stepped between them and baffled him, and now it was all over.\r\nFothergill was as furious with Death as if it had been a rival who\r\nrobbed him. He felt himself the sport of a power to which he could offer\r\nno resistance, and the sense of helplessness was maddening. But his fury\r\nwas of the white, intense, close-lipped kind. Though he had flung a\r\nbitter word or two at Archie, his quarrel was with Destiny. No matter\r\nwho had decreed this thing, Raymond Fothergill was in fierce revolt.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, through it all, he knew perfectly well that Sissy's death would\r\nhardly make any outward change in him. He was robbed of his best\r\nchance, but he did not pretend to himself that his heart was broken or\r\nthat his life was over. Walter Latimer might fancy that kind of thing,\r\nbut Fothergill knew that he should be much such a man as he had been\r\nbefore he met her, only somewhat lower, because he had so nearly been\r\nsomething higher and missed it. That was all.\r\n\r\nMrs. Latimer came for a few moments out of the hushed mystery of that\r\ninner room. The tidings ran through the expectant groups that Sissy had\r\nmoved slightly, and had opened her eyes once, but there was little\r\nhopefulness in the news. She was terribly injured: that much was\r\ncertain, but nothing more. Mrs. Latimer wanted her son. \"Walter,\" she\r\nsaid, \"you must go home and take the girls. Indeed you must. They cannot\r\nstay here, and I cannot send them back without you.\" Latimer refused,\r\nprotested, yielded. \"Mother,\" he said, as he turned to go, \"you don't\r\nknow--\" His voice suddenly gave way.\r\n\r\n\"I do know. Oh, my poor boy!\" She passed quickly to where Evelyn stood,\r\nand told her that Walter had gone to order the horses. \"I would rather\r\nyou were all away before Mrs. Middleton comes,\" she said: \"Henry\r\nHardwicke has gone for her.\"\r\n\r\nThis departure was a signal to the rest. The groups melted away, and\r\nwith sad farewells to one another, and awestruck glances at the windows\r\nof the farmhouse, almost all the guests departed. The sound of wheels\r\nand horse-hoofs died away in the lanes, and all was very still. The bees\r\nhummed busily round the white lilies and the lavender, and on the warm\r\nturf of one of the narrow paths lay Archie Carroll.\r\n\r\nHe had a weight on heart and brain. There had been a moment all blue and\r\nsunny, the last of his happy life, when Sissy's laughing face looked\r\nback at him and he was a light-hearted-boy. Then had come a moment of\r\nhorror and incredulous despair, and that black moment had hardened into\r\neternity. Nightmare is hideous, and Archie's very life had become a\r\nnightmare. Of course he would get over it, like his cousin, though,\r\nunlike his cousin, he did not think so; and their different moods had\r\ntheir different bitternesses. In days to come Carroll would enjoy his\r\nlife once more, would be ready for a joke or an adventure, would dance\r\nthe night through, would fall in love. This misery was a swift and\r\nterrible entrance into manhood, for he could never be a boy again. And\r\nthe scar would be left, though the wound would assuredly heal. But\r\nArchie, stumbling blindly through that awful pass, never thought that he\r\nshould come again to the light of day: it was to him as the blackness of\r\na hopeless hell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE NIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe village-clock struck five. As the last lingering stroke died upon\r\nthe air there was the sound of a carriage rapidly approaching. Carroll\r\nraised his head when it stopped at the gate, and saw Hardwicke spring\r\nout and help a lady to alight. She was an old lady, who walked quickly\r\nto the house, looking neither to right nor left, and vanished within the\r\ndoorway. Hardwicke stopped, as if to give some order to the driver, and\r\nthen hurried after her. Archie stared vaguely, first at them, and then\r\nat the man, who turned his horses and went round to the stables. When\r\nthey were out of sight he laid his head down again. The little scene had\r\nbeen a vivid picture which stamped itself with curious distinctness on\r\nhis brain, yet failed to convey any meaning whatever. He had not the\r\nfaintest idea of the agony of love and fear in Mrs. Middleton's heart as\r\nshe passed him. To Archie, just then, the whole universe was _his_\r\nagony, and there was no room for more.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later came Dr. Grey's brougham. The doctor, as he jumped\r\nout, told his man to wait. He went from the gate to the house more\r\nhurriedly than Mrs. Middleton, and his anxiety was more marked, but he\r\nfound time to look round as he went with keen eyes, which rested for an\r\ninstant on the young sailor, though he lay half hidden by the bushes.\r\nHe too vanished, as the others had vanished.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour later he came out again, and Fothergill followed him. The\r\ndoctor started when he encountered his eager eyes. Fothergill demanded\r\nhis opinion. He began some of the usual speeches in which men wrap up\r\nthe ghastly word \"death\" in such disguise that it can hardly be\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nThe soldier cut him short: \"Please to speak plain English, Dr. Grey.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor admitted the very greatest danger.\r\n\r\n\"Danger--yes,\" said Fothergill, \"but is there any hope? I am not a\r\nfool--I sha'n't go in and scare the women: is there any hope?\"\r\n\r\nThe answer was written on the doctor's face. He had known Sissy Langton\r\nfrom the time when she came, a tiny child, to Brackenhill. He shook his\r\nhead, and murmured something about \"even if there were no other injury,\r\nthe spine--\"\r\n\r\nFothergill caught a glimpse of a hideous possibility, and answered with\r\nan oath. It was not the profanity of the words, so much as the fury with\r\nwhich they were charged, that horrified the good old doctor. \"My dear\r\nsir,\" he remonstrated gently, \"we must remember that this is God's\r\nwill.\"\r\n\r\n\"God's will! God's will! Are you sure it isn't the devil's?\" said\r\nFothergill. \"It seems more like it. If you think it is God's will, you\r\nmay persuade yourself it's yours, for aught I know. But I'm not such a\r\ndamned hypocrite as to make believe it's mine.\"\r\n\r\nAnd with a mechanical politeness, curiously at variance with his face\r\nand speech, he lifted his hat to the doctor as he turned back to the\r\nfarmhouse.\r\n\r\nSo Sissy's doom was spoken--to linger a few hours, more or less, in\r\nhelpless pain, and then to die. The sun, which had dawned so joyously,\r\nwas going down as serenely as it had dawned, but it did not matter much\r\nto Sissy now. She was sensible, she knew Mrs. Middleton. When the old\r\nlady stooped over her she looked up, smiled faintly and said, \"I fell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my darling, I know,\" Aunt Harriet said.\r\n\r\n\"Can I go home?\" Sissy asked after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"No, dear, you must not think of it: you mustn't ask to go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought not,\" said Sissy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Middleton asked her if she felt much pain.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" she said, and closed her eyes.\r\n\r\nLater, Henry Hardwicke sent in a message, and the old lady came out to\r\nspeak to him. He was standing by an open casement in the passage,\r\nlooking out at the sunset through the orchard boughs. \"What is it,\r\nHarry?\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe started and turned round: \"I beg your pardon, Mrs. Middleton, but I\r\nthought in case you wanted to send any telegrams--if--if--I mean I\r\nthought you might want to send some, and there is not very much time.\"\r\n\r\nShe put her hand to her head. \"I ought to, oughtn't I?\" she said. \"Who\r\nshould be sent for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hammond?\" Hardwicke questioned doubtfully.\r\n\r\nSomething like relief or pleasure lighted her sad eyes: \"Yes, yes! send\r\nfor Godfrey Hammond. He will come.\" She was about to leave him, but the\r\nyoung fellow stepped forward: \"Mrs. Middleton\"--was it the clear red\r\nlight from the window that suddenly flushed his face?--\"Mrs. Middleton,\r\nshall I send for Mr. Percival Thorne?\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped, looking strangely at him: something in his voice surprised\r\nher. \"For Percival?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"May I? I think he ought to come.\" The hot color was burning on his\r\ncheeks. What right had he to betray the secret which he believed he had\r\ndiscovered? And yet could he stand by and not speak for her when she had\r\nso little time in which to speak for herself?\r\n\r\n\"Is it for his sake,\" said Mrs. Middleton, \"or is it that you think--?\r\nWell, let it be so: send for Percival. Yes,\" she added, \"perhaps I have\r\nmisunderstood. Yes, send at once for Percival.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go,\" said Harry, hurrying down the passage. \"The message shall be\r\nsent off at once. I'll take it to Fordborough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must you go yourself?\" Mrs. Middleton raised her voice a little as he\r\nmoved away.\r\n\r\n\"No: let me go,\" said Captain Fothergill, turning the farther corner: \"I\r\nam going to Fordborough. What is it? I will take it. Mrs. Middleton, you\r\nwill let me be your messenger?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very good,\" she said.--\"Harry, you will write--I can't. Oh, I\r\nmust go back.\" And she vanished, leaving the two men face to face.\r\n\r\n\"I've no telegraph-forms,\" said Harry after a pause. \"If you would take\r\nthe paper to my father, he will send the messages.\"\r\n\r\nFothergill nodded silently, and went out to make ready for his journey.\r\nHardwicke followed him, and stood in the porch pencilling on the back of\r\nan old letter. When Fothergill had given his orders he walked up to\r\nCarroll, touched the lad's shoulder with the tips of his fingers, and\r\nstood away. \"Come,\" he said.\r\n\r\nArchie raised himself from the ground and stumbled to his feet: \"Come?\r\nwhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"To Fordborough.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy started and stepped back. He looked at the farmhouse, he looked\r\nat his cousin. \"I'll come afterward,\" he faltered.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said Fothergill. \"I'm going now, and of course you go with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nArchie shrank away, keeping his eyes fixed, as if in a kind of\r\nfascination, on his cousin's terrible eyes. The idea of going back alone\r\nwith Raymond was awful to him. \"No, I can't come, Ray--indeed I can't,\"\r\nhe said. \"I'll walk: I'd much rather--I would indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" said Fothergill. \"You are doing no good here. Do you know I\r\nhave a message to take? I can't be kept waiting. Don't be a fool,\" he\r\nsaid in a lower but not less imperative voice.\r\n\r\nArchie glanced despairingly round. Hardwicke came forward with the paper\r\nin his outstretched hand: \"Leave him here, Captain Fothergill. I dare\r\nsay I shall go to the inn in the village, and he may go with me. He can\r\ntake you the earliest news to-morrow morning.\"\r\n\r\nArchie looked breathlessly from one to the other. \"As you please,\" said\r\nFothergill, and strode off without another word.\r\n\r\nThe boy tried to say something in the way of thanks. \"Oh, it's nothing,\"\r\nHardwicke replied. \"You won't care what sort of quarters they may turn\r\nout to be, I know.\" And he went back to the house with a little shrug of\r\nhis shoulders at the idea of having young Carroll tied to him in this\r\nfashion. He did not want the boy, but Hardwicke could never help\r\nsacrificing himself.\r\n\r\nSo Archie went to the gate and watched his cousin ride away, a slim\r\nblack figure on his black horse against the burning sky. Fothergill\r\nnever turned his head. Where was the use of looking back? He was intent\r\nonly on his errand, and when that piece of paper should have been\r\ndelivered into Mr. Hardwicke's hands the last link between Sissy Langton\r\nand himself would be broken. There would be no further service to\r\nrender. Fothergill did not know that the message he carried was to\r\nsummon his rival, but it would have made no difference in his feelings\r\nif he had. Nothing made any difference now.\r\n\r\nMrs. Middleton sat by Sissy's bedside in the clear evening light. Harry\r\nHardwicke's words haunted her: why did he think that Sissy wanted\r\nPercival? They had parted a year ago, and she had believed that Sissy\r\nwas cured of her liking for him. It was Sissy who had sent him away, and\r\nshe had been brighter and gayer of late: indeed, Mrs. Middleton had\r\nfancied that Walter Latimer-- Well, that was over, but if Sissy cared\r\nfor Percival--\r\n\r\nA pair of widely-opened eyes were fixed on her: \"Am I going to die, Aunt\r\nHarriet?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not. Oh, my darling, I pray that you may live.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I am going to die. Will it be very soon? Would there be time to\r\nsend--\"\r\n\r\n\"We will send for anything or any one you want. Do you feel worse, dear?\r\nTime to send for whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"For Percival.\"\r\n\r\n\"Harry Hardwicke has sent for him already. Perhaps he has the message by\r\nnow: it is an hour and a half since the messenger went.\"\r\n\r\n\"When will he come?\"\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow, darling.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Then the faint voice came again: \"What time?\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Middleton went to the door and called softly to Hardwicke. He had\r\nbeen looking in Bradshaw, and she returned directly: \"Percival will come\r\nby the express to-night. He will be at Fordborough by the quarter-past\r\nnine train, and Harry will meet him and bring him over at once--by ten\r\no'clock, he says, or a few minutes later.\"\r\n\r\nSissy's brows contracted for a moment: she was calculating the time.\r\n\"What is it now?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Twenty minutes to eight.\"\r\n\r\nFourteen hours and a half! The whole night between herself and Percival!\r\nThe darkness must come and must go, the sun must set and must again be\r\nhigh in the heavens, before he could stand by her side. It seemed to\r\nSissy as if she were going down into the blackness of an awful gulf,\r\nwhere Death was waiting for her. Would she have strength to escape him,\r\nto toil up the farther side, and to reach the far-off to-morrow and\r\nPercival? \"Aunt Harriet,\" she said, \"shall I live till then? I want to\r\nspeak to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my darling--indeed you will. Don't talk so: you will break my\r\nheart. Perhaps God will spare you.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Sissy--\"no.\"\r\n\r\nBetween eight and nine Hardwicke was summoned again. Mrs. Latimer wanted\r\nsome one to go to Latimer's Court, to take the latest news and to say\r\nthat it was impossible she could return that night. \"You see they went\r\naway before Dr. Grey came,\" she said. \"I have written a little note. Can\r\nyou find me a messenger?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will either find one or I will go myself,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't mean to trouble you. And wait a moment, for Mrs. Middleton\r\nwants him to go on to her house. She will come and speak to you when I\r\ngo back to the poor girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"How is Miss Langton?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hardly know. I think she is wandering a little: she talked just now\r\nabout some embroidery she has been doing--asked for it, in fact.\"\r\n\r\n\"When Dr. Grey was obliged to go he didn't think there would be any\r\nchange before he came back, surely?\" said Hardwicke anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"No. But she can't know what she is saying, can she? Poor girl! she will\r\nnever do another stitch.\" Mrs. Latimer fairly broke down. The unfinished\r\nembroidery which never could be finished brought the truth home to her.\r\nIt is hard to realize that a life with its interlacing roots and fibres\r\nis broken off short.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Mrs. Latimer, don't! don't!\" Harry exclaimed, aghast at her tears.\r\n\"For dear Mrs. Middleton's sake!\" He rushed away, and returned with\r\nwine. \"If you give way what will become of us?\"\r\n\r\nShe was better in a few minutes, and able to go back, while Harry waited\r\nin quiet confidence for Mrs. Middleton. He was not afraid of a burst of\r\nhelpless weeping when she came. She was gentle, yielding, delicate, but\r\nthere was something of the old squire's obstinacy in her, and in a\r\nsupreme emergency it came out as firmness. She looked old and frail as\r\nshe stepped into the passage and closed the door after her. Her hand\r\nshook, but her eyes met his bravely and her lips were firm.\r\n\r\n\"You'll have some wine too,\" he said, pouring it out as a matter of\r\ncourse. \"You can drink it while you tell me what I am to do.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the glass with a slight inclination of her head, and explained\r\nthat she wanted an old servant who had been Sissy's nurse when she was a\r\nlittle child. \"Mrs. Latimer is very kind,\" she said, \"but Sissy will\r\nlike her own people best. And Sarah would be broken-hearted--\" She\r\npaused. \"Here is a list of things that I wish her to bring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Latimer thought Miss Langton was not quite herself,\" he said\r\ninquiringly.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean because she talked of her work? Oh, I don't think so. She\r\nanswers quite sensibly--indeed, she speaks quite clearly. That was the\r\nonly thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then is it down in the list, this needlework? Or where is it to be\r\nfound?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will bring it?\" said Mrs. Middleton. \"Well, perhaps--\"\r\n\r\n\"If she should ask again,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"True. Yes, yes, bring it.\" She told him where to find the little case.\r\n\"The fancy may haunt her. How am I to thank you, Harry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" he said. \"Only let me do what I can.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearly eleven before Hardwicke had accomplished his double errand\r\nand returned with Sarah. The stars were out, the ruins of the priory\r\nrose in great black masses against the sky, the farmhouse windows\r\nbeneath the overhanging eaves were like bright eyes gazing out into the\r\nnight. Dr. Grey had come back in the interval, and had seen his patient.\r\nThere was nothing new to say, and nothing to be done, except to make the\r\npath to the grave as little painful as might be. He was taking a nap in\r\nMr. Greenwell's arm-chair when the young man came in, but woke up clear\r\nand alert in a moment. \"Ah, you have come?\" he said, recognizing the old\r\nservant. \"That's well: you'll save your mistress a little. Only, mind,\r\nwe mustn't have any crying. If there is anything of that sort you will\r\ndo more harm than good.\"\r\n\r\nSarah deigned no reply, but passed on. Mrs. Middleton came out to meet\r\nthem. Sissy had not spoken. She lay with her eyes shut, and moaned now\r\nand then. \"Are you going home, Harry?\" said the old lady.\r\n\r\n\"Only into the village: I've got a room at the Latimer Arms. It isn't\r\ntwo minutes' walk from here, so I can be fetched directly if I'm\r\nwanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you will be sure to meet the train?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will: you may depend upon me. But I shall come here first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, then. Go and get some rest.\"\r\n\r\nHardwicke went off to look for Archie Carroll. He found him in the\r\nsquare flagged hall, sitting on the corner of a window-seat, with his\r\nhead leaning against the frame, among Mrs. Greenwell's geraniums. \"Come\r\nalong, old fellow,\" said Harry.\r\n\r\nThere was only a glimmering candle, and the hall was very dim. Archie\r\ngot up submissively and groped his way after his guide. \"Where are we\r\ngoing?\" he asked as the door was opened.\r\n\r\n\"To a little public-house close by. We couldn't ask the Greenwells to\r\ntake us in.\"\r\n\r\nAs they went out into the road the priory rose up suddenly on the left\r\nand towered awfully above them. Carroll shuddered, drew closer to his\r\ncompanion and kept his eyes fixed on the ground. \"I feel as if I were\r\nthe ghost of myself, and those were the ghosts of the ruins,\" he said as\r\nhe hurried past.\r\n\r\nThe flight of fancy was altogether beyond Hardwicke: \"You've been\r\nsitting alone and thinking. There has been nothing for you to do, and I\r\ncouldn't help leaving you. Here we are.\"\r\n\r\nThey turned into the little sanded parlor of the ale-house. Hardwicke\r\nhad looked in previously and given his orders, and supper was laid ready\r\nfor them. He sat down and began to help himself, but Archie at first\r\nrefused to eat.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said Harry. \"You have had nothing since the beginning of the\r\nday. We must not break down, any of us.\" And with a little persuasion he\r\nprevailed, and saw the lad make a tolerable supper and drink some brandy\r\nand water afterward. \"Vile brandy!\" said Hardwicke as he set his tumbler\r\ndown. Archie was leaning with both elbows on the table, gazing at him.\r\nHis eyes were heavy and swollen, and there were purple shadows below\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hardwicke,\" he said, \"you've been very good to me. Do you think it\r\nwas my fault?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do I think what was your fault?\"\r\n\r\n\"_This!_\" Archie said--\"to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"No--not if I understand it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ray said if he had been there--\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish he had been. But we must not expect old heads on young\r\nshoulders. How did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"We climbed up on the wall, and she was saying how narrow and broken it\r\nwas, and I picked some of that stuff and called to her, and as she\r\nlooked back--\"\r\n\r\nHardwicke groaned. \"It was madly imprudent,\" he said. \"But I don't blame\r\nyou. You didn't think. Poor fellow! I only hope you won't think too much\r\nin future. Come, it's time for bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to sleep,\" Archie answered: \"I can't sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Hardwicke. \"But I must try and get a little rest. They\r\nhad only one room for us, so if you can't sleep you'll keep quiet and\r\nlet a fellow see what he can do in that line. And you may call me in the\r\nmorning if I don't wake. But don't worry yourself, for I shall.\"\r\n\r\n\"What time?\" said Carroll.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, from five to six--not later than six.\"\r\n\r\nBut in half an hour it was Carroll who lay worn out and sleeping\r\nsoundly, and Hardwicke who was counting the slow minutes of that\r\nintolerable night.\r\n\r\nSarah had been indignant that Dr. Grey should tell her not to cry. But\r\nwhen Sissy looked up with a gentle smile of recognition, and instead of\r\ncalling her by her name said \"Nurse,\" as she used to say in old times,\r\nthe good woman was very near it indeed, and was obliged to go away to\r\nthe window to try to swallow the lump that rose up in her throat and\r\nalmost choked her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Middleton sat by her darling's bedside. She had placed the little\r\nwork-case in full view, and presently Sissy noticed it and would have it\r\nopened. The half-finished strip of embroidery was laid within easy reach\r\nof hand and eye. She smiled, but was not satisfied. \"The case,\" she\r\nsaid. Her fingers strayed feebly among the little odds and ends which it\r\ncontained, and closed over something which she kept.\r\n\r\nThen there was a long silence, unbroken till Sissy was thirsty and\r\nwanted something to drink. \"What time?\" she said when she had finished.\r\n\r\n\"Half-past twelve.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will have another candle,\" said Aunt Harriet.\r\n\r\n\"No: the candle only makes me see how dark it is all round.\"\r\n\r\nAgain there was silence, but not so long this time. And again Sissy\r\nbroke it: \"Aunt Harriet, he is coming now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, darling, he is coming.\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel as if I saw the train, with red lights in front, coming through\r\nthe night--always coming, but never any nearer.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it _is_ nearer every minute. Percival is nearer now than when you\r\nspoke.\"\r\n\r\nSissy said \"Yes,\" and was quiet again till between one and two. Then\r\nMrs. Middleton perceived that her eyes were open. \"What is it, dear\r\nchild?\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"The night is so long!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sissy,\" said Aunt Harriet softly, \"I want you to listen to me. A year\r\nago, when Godfrey died and I talked about the money that I hoped to\r\nleave you one day, you told me what you should like me to do with it\r\ninstead, because you had enough and you thought it was not fair. I\r\ndidn't quite understand then, and I would not promise. Do you remember?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sissy, shall I promise now? I've been thinking about it, and I've no\r\nwish on earth but to make you happy. Will it make you happier if I\r\npromise now that it shall be as you said?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Sissy with eager eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Then I do promise: all that is mine to leave he shall have.\"\r\n\r\nSissy answered with a smile. \"Kiss me,\" she said. And so the promise was\r\nsealed. After that the worst of the night seemed somehow to be over.\r\nSissy slept a little, and Aunt Harriet nodded once or twice in the\r\neasy-chair. Starting into wakefulness after one of these moments, she\r\nsaw the outline of the window faintly defined in gray, and thanked God\r\nthat the dawn had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nBY THE EXPRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Hardwicke, not knowing Percival Thorne's precise address, had\r\ntelegraphed to Godfrey Hammond, begging him to forward the message\r\nwithout delay. A couple of days earlier Hammond had suddenly taken it\r\ninto his head that he was tired of being in town and would go away\r\nsomewhere. In a sort of whimsical amusement at his own mood he decided\r\nthat the Land's End ought to suit a misanthrope, and promptly took a\r\nticket for Penzance as a considerable step in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIt made no difference to Percival, for Hammond had left full directions\r\nwith a trustworthy servant in case any letters should come for Mr.\r\nThorne, and the man sent the message on to Brenthill at once. But it\r\nmade a difference to Hammond himself. When Hardwicke despatched the\r\ntelegram to his address in town Godfrey lay on the turf at the Lizard\r\nHead, gazing southward across the sunlit sea, while the seabirds\r\nscreamed and the white waves broke on the jagged rocks far below.\r\n\r\nBut with Percival there was no delay. The message found him in Bellevue\r\nstreet, though he did not return there immediately after his parting\r\nwith Judith. He wanted the open air, the sky overhead, movement and\r\nliberty to calm the joyful tumult in heart and brain. He hastened to the\r\nnearest point whence he could look over trees and fields. The prospect\r\nwas not very beautiful. The trees were few--some cropped willows by a\r\nmud-banked rivulet and a group or two of gaunt and melancholy elms. And\r\nthe fields had a trodden, suburban aspect, which made it hardly needful\r\nto stick up boards describing them as eligible building-ground. Yet\r\nthere was grass, such as it was, and daisies sprinkled here and there,\r\nand soft cloud-shadows gliding over it. Percival's unreal and fantastic\r\ndream had perished suddenly when Judith put her hand in his. Now, as he\r\nwalked across these meadows, he saw a new vision, that dream of noble,\r\nsimple poverty, which, if it could but be realized, would be the fairest\r\nof all.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned from his walk, and came once more to the well-known\r\nstreet which he was learning to call \"home,\" he was so much calmer that\r\nhe thought he was quite himself again. Not the languid, hopeless self\r\nwho had lived there once, but a self young, vigorous, elate, rejoicing\r\nin the present and looking confidently toward the future.\r\n\r\n  This I can tell,\r\n  That all will go well,\r\n\r\nwas the keynote of his mood. He felt as if he trod on air--as if he had\r\nbut to walk boldly forward and every obstacle must give way. The door of\r\nNo. 13 was open, and a boy who had brought a telegram was turning away\r\nfrom it. Hurrying in with eager eyes and his face bright with unspoken\r\njoy, Percival nearly ran up against Mrs. Bryant and Emma, whose heads\r\nwere close together over the address on the envelope.\r\n\r\n\"Lor! Mr. Thorne, how you startled me! It's for you,\" said his landlady.\r\n\r\nHe went up the stairs two at a time, with his message in his hand. Here\r\nwas some good news--not for one moment did he dream it could be other\r\nthan good news--come to crown this day, already the whitest of his life.\r\nHe tore the paper open and read it by the red sunset light, hotly\r\nreflected from a wilderness of tiles.\r\n\r\nHe read it twice--thrice--caught at the window-frame to steady himself,\r\nand stood staring vaguely at the smoke which curled upward from a\r\nneighboring chimney. He was stunned. The words seemed to have a meaning\r\nand no meaning. \"This is not how people receive news of death, surely?\"\r\nhe thought. \"I suppose I am in my right senses, or is it a dream?\"\r\n\r\nHe made a strong effort to regain his self-command, but all certainties\r\neluded him. This was not the first time that he had taken up a telegram\r\nand believed that he read the tidings of Sissy's death. He had\r\nmisunderstood it now as then. It could not be. But why could he not\r\nwake?\r\n\r\n\"Ashendale.\" Yes, he remembered Ashendale. He had ridden past the ruins\r\nthe last day he ever rode with Sissy, the day that Horace came home. It\r\nbelonged to the Latimers--to Walter Latimer. And Sissy was dying at\r\nAshendale!\r\n\r\nAll at once he knew that it was no dream. But the keen edge of pain\r\nawoke him to the thought of what he had to do, and sent him to hunt\r\namong a heap of papers for a time-table. He drew a long breath. The\r\nexpress started at 10.5, and it was now but twenty minutes past eight.\r\n\r\nHe caught up his hat and hurried to the office. Mr. Ferguson, who seldom\r\nleft much before that time, was on the doorstep. While he was getting\r\ninto his dog-cart Percival hastily explained that he had been summoned\r\non a matter of life and death. \"Sorry to hear it,\" said the lawyer as he\r\ntook the reins--\"hope you may find things better than you expect. We\r\nshall see you again when you come back.\" And with a nod he rattled down\r\nthe street. Percival stood on the pavement gazing after him, when he\r\nsuddenly remembered that he had no money. \"I might have asked him to\r\ngive me my half week's salary,\" he reflected. \"Not that that would have\r\npaid my fare.\"\r\n\r\nA matter of life and death! Sissy waiting for him at Ashendale, and no\r\nmoney to pay for a railway-ticket! It would have been absurd if it had\r\nnot been horrible. What had he to sell or pawn? By the time he could go\r\nto Bellevue street and return would not the shops be shut? It was a\r\nquarter to nine already. He did not even know where any pawnbroker\r\nlived, nor what he could take to him, and the time was terribly short.\r\nHe was hurrying homeward while these thoughts passed through his mind\r\nwhen Judith's words came back to him: \"I have a pound or two to spare,\r\nand I feel quite rich.\" He took the first turning toward Miss\r\nMacgregor's house.\r\n\r\nOutside her door he halted for a moment. If they would not let him see\r\nJudith, how was he to convey his request? He felt in his pocket, found\r\nthe telegram and pencilled below the message, \"Sissy Langton was once to\r\nhave been my wife: we parted, and I have never seen her since. I have\r\nnot money enough for my railway-fare: can you help me?\" He folded it\r\nand rang the bell.\r\n\r\nNo, he could not see Miss Lisle. She was particularly engaged. \"Very\r\nwell,\" he said: \"be so good as to take this note to her, and I will wait\r\nfor the answer.\" His manner impressed the girl so much that, although\r\nshe had been carefully trained by Miss Macgregor, she cast but one\r\nhesitating glance at the umbrella-stand before she went on her errand.\r\n\r\nPercival waited, eager to be off, yet well assured that it was all right\r\nsince it was in Judith's hands. Presently the servant returned and gave\r\nhim a little packet. The wax of the seal was still warm. He opened it\r\nwhere he stood, and by the light of Miss Macgregor's hall-lamp read the\r\ncouple of lines it contained:\r\n\r\n     \"I cannot come, but I send you all the money I have. I pray God you\r\n     may be in time. Yours, JUDITH.\"\r\n\r\nThere were two sovereigns and some silver. He told the girl to thank\r\nMiss Lisle, and went out into the dusk as the clocks were striking nine.\r\nTen minutes brought him to Bellevue street, and rushing up to his room\r\nhe began to put a few things into a little travelling-bag. In his haste\r\nhe neglected to shut the door, and Mrs. Bryant, whose curiosity had been\r\nexcited, came upon him in the midst of this occupation.\r\n\r\n\"And what may be the meaning of this, Mr. Thorne, if I may make so bold\r\nas to ask?\" she said, eying him doubtfully from the doorway.\r\n\r\nPercival explained that he had had bad news and was off by the express.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bryant's darkest suspicions were aroused. She said it was a likely\r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you gave me the telegram yourself,\" he answered indifferently\r\nwhile he caught up a couple of collars. He was too much absorbed to heed\r\neither Mrs. Bryant or his packing.\r\n\r\n\"And who sent it, I should like to know?\"\r\n\r\nPercival made no answer, and she began to grumble about people who had\r\nmoney enough to travel all over the country at a minute's notice if they\r\nliked, and none to pay their debts--people who made promises by the\r\nhour together, and then sneaked off, leaving boxes with nothing inside\r\nthem, she'd be bound.\r\n\r\nThus baited, Percival at last turned angrily upon her, but before he\r\ncould utter a word another voice interposed: \"What are you always\r\nworrying about, ma? Do come down and have your supper, and let Mr.\r\nThorne finish his packing. He'll pay you every halfpenny he owes you:\r\ndon't you know that?\" And the door was shut with such decision that it\r\nwas a miracle that Mrs. Bryant was not dashed against the opposite wall.\r\n\"Come along,\" said Lydia: \"there's toasted cheese.\"\r\n\r\nPercival ran down stairs five minutes later with his bag in his hand. He\r\nturned into his sitting-room, picked up a few papers and thrust them\r\ninto his desk. He was in the act of locking it when he heard a step\r\nbehind him, and looking round he saw Lydia. She had a cup of tea and\r\nsome bread and butter, which she set down before him. \"You haven't had a\r\nmorsel since the middle of the day,\" she said. \"Just you drink this. Oh,\r\nyou must: there's lots of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Bryant, this is very kind of you, but I don't think--\"\r\n\r\n\"Just you drink it,\" said Lydia, \"and eat a bit too, or you'll be good\r\nfor nothing.\" And while Percival hastily obeyed she glanced round the\r\nroom: \"Nobody'll meddle with your things while you're gone: don't you\r\ntrouble yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I didn't suspect that any one would,\" he replied, hardly thinking\r\nwhether it was likely or not as he swallowed the bread and butter.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that was very nice of you, I'm sure, _I_ should have suspected a\r\nlot if I'd been you,\" said Lydia candidly. \"But nobody shall. Now, you\r\naren't going to leave that tea? Why, it wants twenty minutes to ten, and\r\nnot six minutes' walk to the station!\"\r\n\r\nPercival finished the tea: \"Thank you very much, Miss Bryant.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I say,\" Lydia pursued, pulling her curl with less than her usual\r\nconsideration for its beauty, \"I suppose you _have_ got money enough?\r\nBecause if not, I'll lend you a little. Don't you mind what ma says, Mr.\r\nThorne. I know you're all right.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are very good,\" said Percival. \"I didn't expect so much kindness,\r\nand I've been borrowing already, so I needn't trouble you. But thank you\r\nfor your confidence in me and for your thoughtfulness.\" He held out his\r\nhand to Lydia, and thus bade farewell to Bellevue street.\r\n\r\nShe stood for a moment looking after him. Only a few hours before she\r\nwould have rejoiced in any small trouble or difficulty which might have\r\nbefallen Mr. Thorne. But when he turned round upon her mother and\r\nherself as they stood at his door, her spite had vanished before the\r\nsorrowful anxiety of his eyes. She had frequently declared that Mr.\r\nThorne was no gentleman, and that she despised him, but she knew in her\r\nheart that he _was_ a gentleman, and she was ashamed of her mother's\r\nbehavior. Lydia was capable of being magnanimous, provided the object of\r\nher magnanimity were a man. I doubt if she could have been magnanimous\r\nto a woman. But Percival Thorne was a young and handsome man, and though\r\nshe did not know what his errand might be, she knew that she was not\r\nsending him to Miss Lisle. Standing before his glass, she smoothed back\r\nher hair with both hands, arranged the ribbon at her throat and admired\r\nthe blue earrings and a large locket which she wore suspended from a\r\nchain. Even while she thought kindly of Mr. Thorne, and wished him well,\r\nshe was examining her complexion and her hands with the eye of a critic.\r\n\"I don't believe that last stuff is a mite of good,\" she said to\r\nherself; \"and it's no end of bother. I might as well pitch the bottle\r\nout of the window. It was just as well that he'd borrowed the money of\r\nsome one else, but I'm glad I offered it. I wonder when he'll come\r\nback?\" And with that Lydia returned to her toasted cheese.\r\n\r\nPercival had had a nervous fear of some hinderance on his way to the\r\nstation. It was so urgent that he should go by this train that the\r\nnecessity oppressed him like a nightmare. An earthquake seemed a not\r\nimprobable thing. He was seriously afraid that he might lose his way\r\nduring the five minutes' walk through familiar streets. He imagined an\r\nerror of half an hour or so in all the Brenthill clocks. He hardly knew\r\nwhat he expected, but he felt it a relief when he came to the station\r\nand found it standing in its right place, quietly awaiting him. He was\r\nthe first to take a ticket, and the moment the train drew up by the\r\nplatform his hand was on the door of a carriage, though before getting\r\nin he stopped a porter to inquire if this were the express. The porter\r\nanswered \"Yes, sir--all right,\" with the half smile of superior\r\ncertainty: what else could it be? Thorne took his place and waited a few\r\nminutes, which seemed an eternity. Then the engine screamed, throbbed,\r\nand with quickening speed rushed out into the night.\r\n\r\nA man was asleep in one corner of the carriage, otherwise Percival was\r\nalone. His nervous anxiety subsided, since nothing further depended upon\r\nhim till he reached town, and he sat thinking of Sissy and of that brief\r\nengagement which had already receded into a shadowy past. \"It was a\r\nmistake,\" he mused, \"and she found it out before it was too late. But I\r\nbelieve her poor little heart has been aching for me, lest she wounded\r\nme too cruelly that night. It wasn't her fault. She would have hid her\r\nfear of me, poor child! if she had been able. And she was so sorry for\r\nme in my trouble! I don't think she could be content to go on her way\r\nand take her happiness now while my life was spoilt and miserable. Poor\r\nlittle Sissy! she will be glad to know--\"\r\n\r\nAnd then he remembered that it was to a dying Sissy that the tidings\r\nof marriage and hope must be uttered, if uttered at all. And he sat\r\nas it were in a dull dream, trying to realize how the life which\r\nin the depths of his poverty had seemed so beautiful and safe was\r\nsuddenly cut short, and how Sissy at that moment lay in the darkness,\r\nwaiting--waiting--waiting. The noise of the train took up his thought,\r\nand set it to a monotonous repetition of \"Waiting at Ashendale! waiting\r\nat Ashendale!\" If only she might live till he could reach her! He seemed\r\nto be hurrying onward, yet no nearer. His overwrought brain caught up\r\nthe fancy that Death and he were side by side, racing together through\r\nthe dark, at breathless, headlong speed, to Sissy, where she waited for\r\nthem both.\r\n\r\nOutside, the landscape lay dim and small, dwarfed by the presence of the\r\nnight. And with the lights burning on its breast, as Sissy saw them in\r\nher half-waking visions, the express rushed southward across the level\r\nblackness of the land, beneath the arch of midnight sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\n     Quand on a trouve ce qu'on cherchait, on n'a pas le temps de le\r\n     dire: il faut mourir.--J. JOUBERT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the gray of the early morning had changed to golden sunlight, and\r\nthe first faint twittering of the birds gave place to fuller melody,\r\nMrs. Middleton went softly to the window, opened it and fastened it\r\nback. She drew a long breath of the warm air fresh from the beanfields,\r\nand, looking down into the little orchard below, saw Harry Hardwicke,\r\nwho stepped forward and looked up at her. She signed to him to wait, and\r\na couple of minutes later she joined him.\r\n\r\n\"How is she? How has she passed the night?\" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"She is no worse. She has lived through it bravely, with one thought.\r\nYou were very right to send for Percival.\"\r\n\r\nHardwicke looked down and colored as he had colored when he spoke of him\r\nbefore. \"I'm glad,\" he said. \"I'm off to fetch him in about an hour and\r\na half.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing from Godfrey Hammond?\" she asked after a pause.\r\n\r\n\"No. I'll ask at my father's as I go by. He will either come or we shall\r\nhear, unless he is out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" the old lady answered. \"Godfrey Hammond would not fail me.\r\nAnd now good-bye, Harry, till you bring Percival.\"\r\n\r\nShe went away as swiftly and lightly as she had come a minute before,\r\nand left Hardwicke standing on the turf under the apple trees gazing up\r\nat the open casement. A June morning, sun shining, soft winds blowing, a\r\nyoung lover under his lady's window: it should have been a perfect poem.\r\nAnd the lady within lay crushed and maimed, dying in the very heart of\r\nher June!\r\n\r\nHardwicke let himself out through the little wicket-gate, and went back\r\nto the Latimer Arms. He entered the bedroom without disturbing Archie,\r\nwho lay with his sunburnt face on the white pillow, smiling in his\r\nsleep. He could not find it in his heart to arouse him. The boy's lips\r\nparted, he murmured a word or two, and seemed to sink into a yet deeper\r\nslumber. Hardwicke went softly out, gave the landlady directions about\r\nbreakfast, and returned, watch in hand. \"I suppose I must,\" he said to\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nBut he stopped short. Carroll stirred, stretched himself, his eyes were\r\nhalf open: evidently his waking was a pleasant one. But suddenly the\r\nunfamiliar aspect of the room attracted his attention: he looked eagerly\r\nround, a shadow swept across his face, and he turned and saw Hardwicke.\r\n\"It's true!\" he said, and flung out his arms in a paroxysm of despair.\r\n\r\nHarry walked to the window and leant out. Presently a voice behind him\r\nasked, \"Have you been to the farm, Mr. Hardwicke?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Harry. \"But there is no news. She passed a tolerably quiet\r\nnight: there is no change.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been asleep,\" said Archie after a pause. \"I never thought I should\r\nsleep.\" He looked ashamed of having done so.\r\n\r\n\"It would have been strange if you hadn't: you were worn out.\"\r\n\r\n\"My watch has run down,\" the other continued. \"What is the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Twenty minutes past seven. I want to speak to you, Carroll. I think you\r\nhad better go home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Home? To Fordborough? To Raymond?\"\r\n\r\n\"No. Really home, to your own people. You can write to your cousin. You\r\ndon't want to go back to him?\"\r\n\r\nArchie shook his head. Then a sudden sense of injustice to Fothergill\r\nprompted him to say, \"Ray was never hard on me before.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't think about that,\" Hardwicke replied. \"People don't weigh\r\ntheir words at such times. But, Carroll, you can do nothing here--less\r\nthan nothing. You'll be better away. Give me your address, and I'll\r\nwrite any news there is. Look sharp now, and you can go into Fordborough\r\nwith me and catch the up train.\"\r\n\r\nAs they drove through the green lanes, along which they had passed the\r\nday before, Archie looked right and left, recalling the incidents of\r\nthat earlier drive. Already he was better, possessing his sorrow with\r\ngreater keenness and fulness than at first, but not so miserably\r\npossessed by it. Hardly a word was spoken till they stood on the\r\nplatform and a far-off puff of white showed the coming train. Then he\r\nsaid, \"I shall never forget your kindness, Mr. Hardwicke. If ever\r\nthere's anything I can do--\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll do it,\" said Harry with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"That I will! And you'll write?\"\r\n\r\nHardwicke answered \"Yes.\" He knew too well _what_ it was he promised to\r\nwrite to say a word more.\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to him when Carroll was gone and he could pace the\r\nplatform and watch for the London train. He looked through the open\r\ndoorway, and saw his dog-cart waiting in the road and the horse tossing\r\nhis head impatiently in the sunshine. Through all his anxiety--or rather\r\nside by side with his anxiety--he was conscious of a current of interest\r\nin all manner of trivial things. He thought of the price he had given\r\nfor the horse five months before, and of Latimer's opinion of his\r\nbargain. He noticed the station-master in the distance, and remembered\r\nthat some one had said he drank. He watched a row of small birds sitting\r\non the telegraph-wires just outside the station, and all at once the\r\nLondon train came gliding rapidly and unexpectedly out of the cutting\r\nclose by, and was there.\r\n\r\nA hurried rush along the line of carriages, with his heart sinking lower\r\nat every step, a despairing glance round, and he perceived the man he\r\ncame to meet walking off at the farther end of the platform. He came up\r\nwith him as he stopped to speak to a porter.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! I am in time, then?\" said Percival when he looked round in reply to\r\nHardwicke's hurried greeting.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, thank God! I promised to drive you over to Ashendale at once.\"\r\n\r\nPercival nodded, and took his place without a word. Not till they were\r\nfairly started on their journey did he turn to his companion. \"How did\r\nit happen?\" he asked.\r\n\r\nHardwicke gave him a brief account of the accident. He listened eagerly,\r\nand then, just saying \"It's very dreadful,\" he was silent again. But it\r\nwas the silence of a man intent on his errand, leaning slightly forward\r\nas if drawn by a powerful attraction, and with eyes fixed on the point\r\nwhere he would first see the ruins of Ashendale Priory above the trees.\r\nHardwicke did not venture to speak to him. As the man whom Sissy Langton\r\nloved, Percival Thorne was to him the first of men, but, considered from\r\nHardwicke's own point of view, he was a fellow with whom he had little\r\nor nothing in common--a man who quoted poetry and saw all manner of\r\nthings in pictures and ruins, who went out of his way to think about\r\npolitics, and was neither Conservative nor Radical when all was done--a\r\nman who rather disliked dogs and took no interest in horses. Hardwicke\r\ndid not want to speak about dogs, horses or politics then, but the\r\nconsciousness of their want of sympathy was in his mind.\r\n\r\nAs they drove through the village they caught a passing glimpse of a\r\nbrougham. \"Ha! Brackenhill,\" said Thorne, looking after it. They dashed\r\nround a corner and pulled up in front of the farmhouse. Hardwicke took\r\nno pains to spare the noise of their arrival. He knew very well that the\r\nsound of wheels would be music to Sissy's ears.\r\n\r\nA tall, slim figure, which even on that June morning had the air of\r\nbeing wrapped up, passed and repassed in the hall within. As the two\r\nyoung men came up the path Horace appeared in the porch. Even at that\r\nmoment the change which a year had wrought in him startled Percival. He\r\nwas a mere shadow. He had looked ill before, but now he looked as if he\r\nwere dying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"SEE HERE, SISSY,\" SAID PERCIVAL, \"WE ARE FRIENDS.\"--Page\r\n698.]\r\n\r\n\"She will not see me,\" he said to Hardwicke. His voice was that of a\r\nconfirmed invalid, a mixture of complaint and helplessness. He ignored\r\nhis cousin.\r\n\r\n\"She will see you now that Percival has come,\" said Mrs. Middleton,\r\nadvancing from the background. \"She will see you together.\"\r\n\r\nAnd she led the way. Horace went in second, and Percival last, yet he\r\nwas the first to meet the gaze of those waiting eyes. The young men\r\nstood side by side, looking down at the delicate face on the pillow. It\r\nwas pale, and seemed smaller than usual in the midst of the loosened\r\nwaves of hair. On one side of the forehead there was a dark mark, half\r\nwound, half bruise--a mere nothing but for its terrible suggestiveness.\r\nBut the clear eyes and the gentle little mouth were unchanged. Horace\r\nsaid \"Oh, Sissy!\" and Sissy said \"Percival.\" He could not speak, but\r\nstooped and kissed the little hand which lay passively on the coverlet.\r\n\r\n\"Whisper,\" said Sissy. He bent over her. \"Have you forgiven him?\" she\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" The mere thought of enmity was horrible to him as he looked into\r\nSissy's eyes with that spectral Horace by his side.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure? Quite?\"\r\n\r\n\"Before God and you, Sissy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell him so, Percival.\"\r\n\r\nHe stood up and turned to his cousin. \"Horace!\" he said, and held out\r\nhis hand. The other put a thin hot hand into it.--\"See here, Sissy,\"\r\nsaid Percival, \"we are friends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we're friends,\" Horace repeated. \"Has it vexed you, Sissy? I\r\nthought you didn't care about me. I'm sorry, dear--I'm very sorry.\"\r\n\r\nAunt Harriet, standing by, laid her hand on his arm. She had held aloof\r\nfor that long year, feeling that he was in the wrong. He had not acted\r\nas a Thorne should, and he could never be the same to her as in old\r\ndays. But she had wanted her boy, nevertheless, right or wrong, and\r\nsince Percival had pardoned him, and since it was partly Godfrey's\r\nhardness that had driven him into deceit, and since he was so ill, and\r\nsince--and since--she loved him, she drew his head down to her and\r\nkissed him. Horace was weak, and he had to turn his face away and wipe\r\nhis eyes. But, relinquishing Percival's hand, he held Aunt Harriet's.\r\n\r\nPercival stooped again, in obedience to a sign from Sissy. \"Ask him to\r\nforgive me,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"He knows nothing, dear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask him for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horace,\" said Percival, \"Sissy wants your forgiveness.\"\r\n\r\n\"I've nothing to forgive,\" said Horace. \"It is I who ought to ask to be\r\nforgiven. It was hard on me when first you came to Brackenhill, Percy,\r\nbut it has been harder on you since. I hardly know what I said or did on\r\nthat day: I thought you'd been plotting against me.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Sissy--\"not he.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, but I did think so.--Since then I've felt that, anyhow, it was not\r\nfair. I suppose I was too proud to say so, or hardly knew how,\r\nespecially as the wrong is past mending. But I do ask your pardon now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have it,\" said Percival. \"We didn't understand each other very\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I never blamed you, Sissy--never, for one moment. I wasn't so bad\r\nas that. I've watched for you now and then in Fordborough streets, just\r\nto get a glimpse as you went by. I thought it was you who would never\r\nforgive me, because of Percival.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has forgiven,\" said Sissy. But her eyes still sought Percival's.\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Horace,\" he said. \"There was a misunderstanding you knew\r\nnothing of, and Sissy feels that she might have cleared it up. It _was_\r\ncleared up at last, but I think it altered my grandfather's manner to\r\nyou for a time. If you wish to know the whole I will tell you. But since\r\nit is all over and done with, and did not really do you any harm, if you\r\nlike best\"--he looked steadily at Horace--\"that we should forgive and\r\nforget on both sides, we will bury the past here to-day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Horace. \"Sissy may have made a mistake, but she never\r\nmeant me any harm, I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't! don't! Oh, Horace, I did, but I am sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"God knows I forgive you, whatever it was,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Kiss me, Horace.\"\r\n\r\nHe stooped and kissed her, as he had kissed her many a time when she was\r\nhis little pet and playmate. She kissed him back again, and smiled:\r\n\"Good-bye, Horry!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Middleton interposed. \"This will be too much for her,\" she\r\nsaid.--\"Percival, she wants you, I see: be careful.\" And she drew Horace\r\ngently away.\r\n\r\nPercival sat down by the bedside. Presently Sarah came in and went to\r\nthe farther end of the room, waiting in case she should be wanted. Sissy\r\nwas going to speak once, but Percival stopped her: \"Lie still a little\r\nwhile, dear: I'm not going away.\"\r\n\r\nShe lay still, looking up at this Percival for whom she had watched and\r\nwaited through the dreary night, and who had come to her with the\r\nmorning. And he, as he sat by her side, was thinking how at that time\r\nthe day before he was in the office at Brenthill. He could hardly\r\nbelieve that less than twenty-four hours had given him the assurance of\r\nJudith's love and brought him to Sissy's deathbed. He was in a strangely\r\nexalted state of mind. His face was calm as if cast in bronze, but a\r\ncrowd of thoughts and feelings contended for the mastery beneath it. He\r\nhad eaten nothing since the night before, and had not slept, but his\r\nexcitement sustained him.\r\n\r\nHe met Sissy's eyes and smiled tenderly. How was it that he had\r\nfrightened her in old days? Could he ever have been cruel to one so\r\ndelicate and clinging? Yet he must have been, since he had driven away\r\nher love. She was afraid of him: she had begged to be free. Well, the\r\npast was past, but at least no word nor look of his should frighten or\r\ngrieve the poor child now.\r\n\r\nAfter a time she spoke: \"You have worked too hard. Isn't it that you\r\nwanted to do something great?\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't at all likely,\" said Percival with a melancholy smile. \"I'm\r\nall right, Sissy.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, you are pale. You wanted to surprise us. Oh, I guessed! Godfrey\r\nHammond didn't tell me. I should have been glad if I could have waited\r\nto see it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk so,\" he entreated. \"There will be nothing to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mustn't work too hard--promise,\" she whispered.\r\n\r\n\"No, dear, I won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Percival, will you be good to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I can I will indeed. What can I do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I want you to have my money. It is my own, and I have nobody.\" Sissy\r\nremembered the terrible mistake she had once made, and wanted an\r\nassurance from his own lips that her gift was accepted.\r\n\r\nPercival hesitated for a moment, and even the moment's hesitation\r\nalarmed her. It was true, as she said, that she had nobody, and her\r\nwords opened a golden gateway before Judith and himself. Should he tell\r\nher of that double joy and double gratitude? He believed that she would\r\nbe glad, but it seemed selfish and horrible to talk of love and marriage\r\nby that bedside. \"I wish you might live to need it all yourself, dear,\"\r\nhe answered, and laid his hand softly on hers. The strip of embroidery\r\ncaught his eye. \"What's this?\" he said in blank surprise. \"And your\r\nthimble! Sissy, you mustn't bother yourself about this work now.\" He\r\nwould have drawn it gently away.\r\n\r\nThe fingers closed on it suddenly, and the weak voice panted: \"No,\r\nPercival. It's mine. That was before we were engaged: you spoilt my\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"O God!\" he said. In a moment all came back to him. He remembered the\r\nsummer day at Brackenhill--Sissy and he upon the terrace--the work-box\r\nupset and the thimble crushed beneath his foot. He remembered her pretty\r\nreproaches and their laughter over her enforced idleness. He remembered\r\nhow he rode into Fordborough and bought that little gold thimble--the\r\nfirst present he ever made her. All his gifts during their brief\r\nengagement had been scrupulously returned, but this, as she had said,\r\nwas given before. And she was dying with it in her hand! She had loved\r\nhim from first to last.\r\n\r\n\"Percival, you will take my money?\" she pleaded, fearing some\r\nincomprehensible scruple.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, Sissy! I must think a moment.\" He buried his face in\r\nhis hands.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you are cruel!\" she whispered.\r\n\r\nHow could he think? Sissy loved him--had always loved him. It was all\r\nplain to him now. He had been blind, and he had come back to find out\r\nthe truth the day after he had pledged himself to Judith Lisle!\r\n\r\n\"Don't be unkind to me, Percival: I can't bear it, dear.\"\r\n\r\nHow could he stab her to the heart by a refusal of that which he so\r\nsorely needed? How could he tell her of his engagement? How could he\r\nkeep silence, and take her money to spend it with Judith?\r\n\r\n\"Say 'Yes,' Percival. It is mine. Why not? why not?\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke through his clasped hands: \"One moment more.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall never ask you anything again,\" she whispered. \"Oh, Percival, be\r\ngood to me!\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his head and looked earnestly at her. He must be true, happen\r\nwhat might.\r\n\r\n\"Sissy, God knows I thank you for your goodness. I sha'n't forget it,\r\nliving or dying. If only you might be spared--\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no. Say 'Yes,' Percival.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will say 'Yes' if, when I have done, you wish it still. But it must\r\nbe 'Yes' for some one besides myself. Dear, don't give it to me to make\r\namends in any way. You have not wronged me, Sissy. Don't give it to me,\r\ndear, unless you give it to Judith Lisle.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he looked into her eyes. Their sweet entreaty gave place to\r\na flash of pained reproach, as if they said \"So soon?\" Then the light in\r\nthem wavered and went out. Percival sprang up. \"Help! she has fainted!\"\r\n\r\nSarah hurried from her post by the window, and the sound of quick\r\nfootsteps brought back Mrs. Middleton. The young man stood aside,\r\ndismayed. \"She isn't dead?\" he said in a low voice.\r\n\r\nAunt Harriet did not heed him. A horrible moment passed, during which he\r\nfelt himself a murderer. Then Sissy moaned and turned her face a little\r\nto the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Go now: she cannot speak to you,\" said Mrs. Middleton.\r\n\r\n\"I can't. Only one more word!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean? What have you done? You may wait outside, and I will\r\ncall you. She cannot bear any more now: do you want to kill her\r\noutright?\"\r\n\r\nHe went. There was a wide window-seat in the passage, and he dropped\r\ndown upon it, utterly worn out and wretched. \"What have I done?\" he\r\nasked himself. \"What made me do it? She loved me, and I have been a\r\nbrute to her. If I had been a devil, could I have tortured her more?\"\r\n\r\nPresently Mrs. Middleton came to him: \"She cannot see you now, but she\r\nis better.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked up at her as he sat: \"Aunt Harriet, I meant it for the best.\r\nSay what you like: I was a brute, I suppose, but I thought I was doing\r\nright.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" Her tone was gentler: she detected the misery in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nPercival took her hand and laid it on his forehead. \"You can't think I\r\nmeant to be cruel to our Sissy,\" he said. \"You will let me speak to\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\nShe softly pushed back his hair. After all, he was the man Sissy loved.\r\n\"What was it?\" she asked: \"what did you do?\"\r\n\r\nHe looked down. \"I'm going to marry Miss Lisle,\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe started away from him: \"You told her that? God forgive you,\r\nPercival!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have been a liar if I hadn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't you let her die in peace? It is such a little while! Couldn't\r\nyou have waited till she was in her grave?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will she see me? Just one word, Aunt Harriet.\" And yet while he pleaded\r\nhe did not know what the one word was that he would say. Only he felt\r\nthat he must see her once more.\r\n\r\n\"Not now,\" said Mrs. Middleton. \"My poor darling shall not be tortured\r\nany more. Later, if she wishes it, but not now. She could not bear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you will ask her to see me later?\" he entreated. \"I must see her.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is she to you? She is all the world to me, and she shall be left\r\nin peace. It is all that I can do for her now. You have been cruel to\r\nher always--always. She has been breaking her heart for you: she lived\r\nthrough last night with the hope of your coming. Oh, Percival, God knows\r\nI wish we had never called you away from Miss Lisle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go back to her,\" said Aunt Harriet, \"and leave my darling to me. We\r\nwere happy at Brackenhill till you came there.\"\r\n\r\nHe sprang to his feet: \"Aunt Harriet! have some mercy! You know I would\r\ndie if it could make Sissy any happier.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Miss Lisle?\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe turned away with a groan, and, leaning against the wall, put his hand\r\nover his eyes. Mrs. Middleton hesitated a moment, but her haste to\r\nreturn to Sissy triumphed over any relenting feelings, and she left him,\r\npausing only at the door to make sure of her calmness.\r\n\r\nNoon came and passed. Sissy had spoken once to bid them take the\r\nneedlework away. \"I've done with it,\" she said. Otherwise she was\r\nsilent, and only looked at them with gentle, apathetic eyes when they\r\nspoke to her. Dr. Grey came and went again. On his way out he noticed\r\nPercival, looked keenly at him, but said nothing.\r\n\r\nHenry Hardwicke's desire to be useful had prompted him to station\r\nhimself on the road a short distance from the farm, at the turning from\r\nthe village. There he stopped people coming to inquire, and gave the\r\nlatest intelligence. It was weary work, lounging there by the wayside,\r\nbut he hoped he was serving Sissy Langton to the last. He could not even\r\nhave a cigar to help to pass the time, for he had an idea that Mrs.\r\nMiddleton disliked the smell of smoke. He stared at the trees and the\r\nsky, drew letters in the dust with the end of a stick, stirred up a\r\nsmall ants' nest, examined the structure of a dog-rose or two and some\r\nbuttercups, and compared the flavors of different kinds of leaves. He\r\ncame forward as Dr. Grey went by. The doctor stopped to tell him that\r\nMiss Langton was certainly weaker. \"But she may linger some hours yet,\"\r\nhe added; and he was going on his way when a thought seemed to strike\r\nhim. \"Are you staying at the farm?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No: they've enough without me. I'm at the little public-house close\r\nby.\"\r\n\r\n\"Going there for some luncheon?\"\r\n\r\nHardwicke supposed so.\r\n\r\n\"Can't you get young Thorne to go with you? He looks utterly exhausted.\"\r\n\r\nHardwicke went off on his mission, but he could not persuade him to\r\nstir. \"All right!\" he said at last: \"then I shall bring you something to\r\neat here.\" Percival agreed to that compromise, and owned afterward that\r\nhe felt better for the food he had taken.\r\n\r\nThe slow hours of the afternoon went wearily by. The rector of\r\nFordborough came; Dr. Grey came again; Mrs. Latimer passed two or three\r\ntimes. The sky began to grow red toward the west once more, and the\r\ncawing rooks flew homeward, past the window where Percival sat waiting\r\nvainly for the summons which did not come.\r\n\r\nHardwicke, released from his self-imposed duty, came to see if Percival\r\nwould go with him for half an hour or so to the Latimer Arms. \"I've got\r\na kind of tea-dinner,\" he said--\"chops and that sort of thing. You'd\r\nbetter have some.\" But it was of no use. So when he came back to the\r\nhouse the good-natured fellow brought some more provisions, and begged\r\nLucy Greenwell to make some tea, which he carried up.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going to spend the night?\" asked Harry, coming up again\r\nwhen he had taken away the cup and plate.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said Percival. He sat with his hands clasped behind his head and\r\none leg drawn up on the seat. His face was sharply defined against the\r\nsquare of sunset sky.\r\n\r\nHardwicke stood with his hands in his pockets, looking down at him. \"But\r\nyou can't sleep here,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter much. Sleeping or waking, here I stay.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden hope flashed in his eyes, for the door of Sissy's room opened,\r\nand, closing it behind her, Mrs. Middleton came out and looked up and\r\ndown the passage. But she called \"Harry\" in a low voice, and Percival\r\nleant back again.\r\n\r\nHarry went. Mrs. Middleton had moved a little farther away, and stood\r\nwith her back toward Percival and one hand pressed against the wall to\r\nsteady herself. Her first question was an unexpected one: \"Isn't the\r\nwind getting up?\" Her eyes were frightened and her voice betrayed her\r\nanxiety.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--not much, I think.\" He was taken by surprise, and\r\nhesitated a little.\r\n\r\n\"It is: tell me the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am--I will,\" he stammered. \"I haven't thought about it. There is a\r\npleasant little breeze, such as often comes in the evening. I don't\r\nreally think there's any more.\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't rising, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute,\" said Hardwicke, and hurried off. He did not in the\r\nleast understand his errand, but it was enough for him that Mrs.\r\nMiddleton wanted to know. If she had asked him the depth of water in the\r\nwell or the number of trees on the Priory farm, he would have rushed\r\naway with the same eagerness to satisfy her. His voice was heard in the\r\nporch, alternating with deeper and less carefully restrained tones. Then\r\nthere was a sound of steps on the gravel-path. Presently he came back.\r\nMrs. Middleton's attitude was unchanged, except that she had drawn a\r\nlittle closer to the wall. But though she had never looked over her\r\nshoulder, she was uneasily conscious of the young man half sitting, half\r\nlying in the window-seat behind her.\r\n\r\n\"Greenwell says it won't be anything,\" Hardwicke announced. \"The glass\r\nhas been slowly going up all day yesterday and to-day, and it is rising\r\nstill. He believes we have got a real change in the weather, and that it\r\nwill keep fine for some time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" said Mrs. Middleton. \"Do you think I'm very mad?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" Harry answered in a \"theirs-not-to-reason-why\" manner.\r\n\r\n\"A week or two ago,\" she said, \"my poor darling was talking about dying,\r\nas you young folks will talk, and she said she hoped she should not die\r\nin the night, when the wind was howling round the house. A bitter winter\r\nnight would be worst of all, she said. It won't be _that_ but I fancied\r\nthe wind was getting up, and it frightened me to think how one would\r\nhear it moaning in this old place. It is only a fancy, of course, but\r\nshe might have thought of it again lying there.\"\r\n\r\nHardwicke could not have put it into words, but the fancy came to him\r\ntoo of Sissy's soul flying out into the windy waste of air.\r\n\r\n\"Of course it is nothing--it is nonsense,\" said Mrs. Middleton. \"But if\r\nit might be, as she said, when it is warm and light!--if it might be!\"\r\nShe stopped with a catching in her voice.\r\n\r\nHarry, in his matter-of-fact way, offered consolation: \"Dear Mrs.\r\nMiddleton, the sun will rise by four, and Greenwell says there won't be\r\nany wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes! And she may not remember.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you have been taking some rest,\" he ventured to say after a\r\nbrief silence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I was lying down this afternoon, and Sarah will take part of the\r\nnight.\" She paused, and spoke again in a still lower tone: \"Couldn't you\r\npersuade him to go away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Thorne?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded: \"I will not have her troubled. I asked her if she would see\r\nhim again, and she said, 'No.' I wish he would go. What is the use of\r\nhis waiting there?\"\r\n\r\nHardwicke shrugged his shoulders: \"It is useless for me to try and\r\npersuade him. He won't stir for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would send for him if she wanted him. But she won't.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll speak to him again if you like,\" said Harry, \"though it won't do\r\nany good.\"\r\n\r\nNor did it when a few minutes later the promised attempt was made. \"I\r\nshall stay here,\" said Percival in a tone which conveyed unconquerable\r\ndecision, and Hardwicke was silenced. The Greenwells came later,\r\nregretting that they had not a room to offer Mr. Thorne, but suggesting\r\nthe sofa in the parlor or a mattress on the floor somewhere. Percival,\r\nhowever, declined everything with such courteous resolution that at last\r\nhe was left alone.\r\n\r\nAgain the night came on, with its shadows and its stillness, and the\r\nlight burning steadily in the one room. To all outward seeming it was\r\nthe same as it had been twenty-four hours earlier, but Mrs. Middleton,\r\nwatching by the bedside, was conscious of a difference. Life was at a\r\nlower ebb: there was less eagerness and unrest, less of hope and fear,\r\nmore of a drowsy acquiescence. And Percival, who had been longed for so\r\nwearily the night before, seemed to be altogether forgotten.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, he kept his weary watch outside. He said to himself that he\r\nhad darkened Sissy's last day: he cursed his cruelty, and yet could he\r\nhave done otherwise? He was haunted through the long hours of the night\r\nby the words which had been ever on his lips when he won her--\r\n\r\n  If she love me, this believe,\r\n  I will die ere she shall grieve;\r\n\r\nand he vowed that never was man so forsworn as he. Yet his one desire\r\nhad been to be true. Had he not worshipped Truth? And this was the end\r\nof all.\r\n\r\nHis cruelty, too, had been worse than useless. He had lost this chance\r\nof an independence, as he had lost Brackenhill. He hated himself for\r\nthinking of money then, yet he could not help thinking of it--could not\r\nhelp being aware that Sissy's entreaty to him to take her fortune was\r\nworth nothing unless a will were made, and that there had been no\r\nmention of such a thing since she spoke to him that morning. And he was\r\nso miserably poor! Of whom should he borrow the money to take him back\r\nto his drudgery at Brenthill? Well, since Sissy no longer cared for his\r\nfuture, it was well that he had spoken. Better poverty than treachery.\r\nLet the money go; but, oh, to see her once again and ask her to forgive\r\nhim!\r\n\r\nAs the night crept onward he grew drowsy and slept by snatches, lightly\r\nand uneasily, waking with sudden starts to a consciousness of the window\r\nat his side--a loophole into a ghostly sky where shreds of white cloud\r\nwere driven swiftly before the breeze. The wan crescent of the moon\r\ngleamed through them from time to time, showing how thin and\r\nphantom-like they were, and how they hurried on their way across the\r\nheavens. After a time the clouds and moon and midnight sky were mingled\r\nwith Percival's dreams, and toward morning he fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAgain Aunt Harriet saw the first gray gleam of dawn. Slowly it stole in,\r\nwidening and increasing, till the candle-flame, which had been like a\r\ngolden star shining out into the June night, was but a smoky yellow\r\nsmear on the saffron morning. She rose and put it out. Turning, she\r\nencountered Sissy's eyes. They looked from her to a window at the foot\r\nof the bed. \"Open,\" said Sissy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Middleton obeyed. The sound of unfastening the casement awoke\r\nSarah, who was resting in an easy-chair. She sat up and looked round.\r\n\r\nThe breeze had died away, as Harry had foretold it would, and that day\r\nhad dawned as gloriously as the two that had preceded it. A lark was\r\nsoaring and singing--a mere point in the dome of blue.\r\n\r\nSissy lay and looked a while. Then she said, \"Brackenhill?\"\r\n\r\nAunt Harriet considered for a moment before she replied: \"A little to\r\nthe right, my darling.\"\r\n\r\nThe dying eyes were turned a little to the right. Seven miles away, yet\r\nthe old gray manor-house rose before Aunt Harriet's eyes, warm on its\r\nsouthern slope, with its shaven lawns and whispering trees and the long\r\nterrace with its old stone balustrade. Perhaps Sissy saw it too.\r\n\r\n\"Darling, it is warm and light,\" the old lady said at last.\r\n\r\nSissy smiled. Her eyes wandered from the window. \"Aunt, you promised,\"\r\nshe whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, dear--yes, I promised.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause. Suddenly, Sissy spoke, more strongly and clearly than\r\nshe had spoken for hours: \"Tell Percival--my love to Miss Lisle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fetch him,\" said Mrs. Middleton to Sarah, with a quick movement of her\r\nhand toward the door. As the old woman crossed the room Sissy looked\r\nafter her. In less than a minute Percival came in. His dark hair was\r\ntumbled over his forehead, and his eyes, though passionately eager, were\r\nheavy with sleep. As he came forward Sissy looked up and repeated\r\nfaintly, like an echo, \"My love to Miss Lisle, Percival.\" Her glance met\r\nhis and welcomed him. But even as he said \"Sissy!\" her eyes closed, and\r\nwhen, after a brief interval, they opened again, he was conscious of a\r\nchange. He spoke and took her hand, but she did not heed. \"She does not\r\nknow me!\" he said.\r\n\r\nHer lips moved, and Aunt Harriet stooped to catch the faint sound. It\r\nwas something about \"Horry--coming home from school.\"\r\n\r\nHardly knowing what she said--only longing for one more look, one smile\r\nof recognition, one word--Aunt Harriet spoke in painfully distinct\r\ntones: \"My darling, do you want Horace? Shall we send for Horace?\"\r\n\r\nNo answer. There was a long pause, and then the indistinct murmur\r\nrecommenced. It was still \"Horry,\" and \"Rover,\" and presently they\r\nthought she said \"Langley Wood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horace used to take her there for a treat,\" said Mrs. Middleton.--\"Oh,\r\nSissy, don't you know Aunt Harriet?\"\r\n\r\nStill, from time to time, came the vague murmur of words. It was\r\ndark--the trees--she had lost--\r\n\r\nPercival stood in silent anguish. There was to him a bitterness worse\r\nthan the bitterness of death in the sound of those faint words. Sissy\r\nwas before him, yet she had passed away into the years when she did not\r\nknow him. He might cry to her, but she would not hear. There was no word\r\nfor him: the Sissy who had loved him and pardoned him was dead. This was\r\nthe child Sissy with whom Horace had played at Brackenhill.\r\n\r\nThe long bright morning seemed an eternity of blue sky, softly rustling\r\nleaves, birds singing and golden chequers of sunlight falling on walls\r\nand floor. Dr. Grey came in and stood near. The end was at hand, and yet\r\ndelayed. The sun was high before the faint whispers of \"Auntie,\" and\r\n\"Horry,\" ceased altogether, and even then there was an interval during\r\nwhich Sissy still breathed, still lingered in the borderland between\r\nliving and dying. Eagerly though they watched her, they could not tell\r\nthe moment when she left them.\r\n\r\nIt was late that afternoon. Hardwicke lounged with his back against the\r\ngate of the orchard and his hands in his pockets. When he lifted his\r\neyes from the turf on which he stood he could see the white blankness of\r\na closed window through the boughs.\r\n\r\nHe was sorely perplexed. Not ten minutes earlier Mrs. Latimer had been\r\nthere, saying, \"Something should be done: why does not Mr. Thorne go to\r\nher? Or could Dr. Grey say anything if he were sent for? I'm sure it\r\nisn't right that she should be left so.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Middleton was alone with her dead in that darkened room. She was\r\nperfectly calm and tearless. She only demanded to be left to herself.\r\nMrs. Latimer would have gone in to cry and sympathize, but she was\r\nrepulsed with a decision which was almost fierce. Sarah was not to\r\ndisturb her. She wanted nothing. She wanted nobody. She must be by\r\nherself. She was terrible in her lonely misery.\r\n\r\nHardwicke felt that it could not be his place to go. Somewhere in the\r\npriory ruins was Percival Thorne, hiding his sorrow and himself: should\r\nhe find him and persuade him to make the attempt? But Harry had an\r\nundefined feeling that Mrs. Middleton did not want Percival.\r\n\r\nHe stood kicking at a daisy-root in the grass, feeling himself useless,\r\nyet unwilling to desert his post, when a hand was pressed on his\r\nshoulder and he started round. Godfrey Hammond was on the other side of\r\nthe gate, looking just as cool and colorless as usual.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God you're come, Mr. Hammond!\" Harry exclaimed, and began to\r\npour out his story in such haste that it was a couple of minutes before\r\nGodfrey fully understood him. The new-comer listened attentively, asking\r\na question or two. He brushed some imperceptible dust from his gray\r\ncoat-sleeve, and sticking his glass in his eye he surveyed the\r\nfarmhouse.\r\n\r\n\"I think I should like to see Mrs. Middleton at once,\" he said when\r\nHardwicke had finished.\r\n\r\nSarah showed him the way, but he preferred to announce himself. He\r\nknocked at the door.\r\n\r\n\"Who is there?\" said the voice within.\r\n\r\n\"It is I, Godfrey Hammond: I may come in?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the door and saw her sitting by the bedside, where something\r\nlay white and straight and still. She turned her head as he entered,\r\nthen stood up and came a step or two to meet him. \"Oh, Godfrey!\" she\r\nsaid in a low voice, \"she died this morning.\"\r\n\r\nHe put his arm about her. \"I would have been here before if I could,\" he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it.\" She trembled so much that he drew her nearer, supporting\r\nher as tenderly as if he were her son, though his face above her was\r\nunmoved as ever.\r\n\r\n\"She died this morning,\" Mrs. Middleton repeated. She hid her face\r\nsuddenly and burst into a passion of tears. \"Oh, Godfrey! she was hurt\r\nso! she was hurt so! Oh my darling!\"\r\n\r\n\"We could not wish her to linger in pain,\" he said softly.\r\n\r\n\"No, no. But only this morning, and I feel as if I had been alone for\r\nyears!\"\r\n\r\nStill, through her weeping, she clung to him. His sympathy made a faint\r\nglimmer of light in the darkness, and her sad eyes turned to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nAFTERWARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is little more to write. Four years, with their varying seasons,\r\ntheir endless procession of events, their multitude of joys and sorrows,\r\nhave passed since Sissy died. Her place in the world, which seemed so\r\nblank and strange in its first vacancy, is closed up and lost in the\r\ncrowding occupations of our ordinary life. She is not forgotten, but she\r\nhas passed out of the light of common day into the quiet world of years\r\ngone by, where there is neither crowd nor haste, but soft shadows and\r\nshadowy sunshine, and time for every tender memory and thought. Even\r\nAunt Harriet's sorrow is patient and subdued, and she sees her darling's\r\nface, with other long-lost faces, softened as in a gentle dream. She\r\nlooks back to the past with no pain of longing. At seventy-eight she\r\nbelieves that she is nearer to those she loves by going forward yet a\r\nlittle farther. Nor are these last days sad, for in her loneliness\r\nGodfrey Hammond persuaded her to come to him, and she is happy in her\r\nplace by his fireside. He is all that is left to her, and she is wrapped\r\nup in him. Nothing is good enough for Godfrey, and he says, with a\r\nsmile, that she would make the planets revolve round him if she could.\r\nIt is very possible that if she had her will she might attempt some\r\nlittle rearrangement of that kind. Her only fear is lest she should ever\r\nbe a burden to him. But that will never be. Godfrey likes her delicate,\r\nold-fashioned ways and words, and is glad to see the kind old face which\r\nsmiled on him long ago when he was a lad lighted up with gentle pleasure\r\nin his presence now. When he bids her good-night he knows that she will\r\npray before she lies down, and he feels as if his home and he were the\r\nbetter for those simple prayers uttered night and morning in an unbroken\r\nsequence of more than seventy years. There is a tranquil happiness in\r\nthat house, like the short, golden days of a St. Martin's summer or the\r\nNovember blooming of a rose.\r\n\r\nIn the February after Sissy's death Godfrey went to Rookleigh for a day,\r\nto be present at a wedding in the old church where the bridegroom had\r\nonce lingered idly in the hot summer-time and pictured his marriage to\r\nanother bride. That summer afternoon was not forgotten. Percival,\r\nstanding on the uneven pavement above the Shadwells' vault, remembered\r\nhis vision of Sissy's frightened eyes even while he uttered the words\r\nthat bound him to Judith Lisle. But those words were not the less true\r\nbecause the thought of Sissy was hidden in his heart for ever.\r\n\r\nSince that day Percival has spent almost all his time abroad, leading\r\nsuch a life as he pictured long ago, only the reality is fairer than the\r\nday-dream, because Judith shares it with him. Together they travel or\r\nlinger as the fancy of the moment dictates. Percival does not own a\r\nsquare yard of the earth's surface, and therefore he is at liberty to\r\nwander over it as he will. He is conscious of a curious loneliness about\r\nJudith and himself. They have no child, no near relations: it seems as\r\nif they were freed from all ordinary ties and responsibilities. His\r\nvague aspirations are even less definite than of old; yet, though his\r\nlife follows a wandering and uncertain track, fair flowers of\r\nkindliness, tolerance and courtesy spring up by that wayside. Judith and\r\nhe do not so much draw closer day by day as find ever new similarity of\r\nthought and feeling already existing between them. His heart turns to\r\nher as to a haven of peace; all his possibilities of happiness are in\r\nher hands; he rests in the full assurance that neither deed nor word of\r\nhers can ever jar upon him; in his darker moods he thinks of her as\r\nclear, still sunlight, and he has no desire apart from her. Yet when he\r\nlooks back he doubts whether his life can hold another moment so supreme\r\nin love and anguish as that moment when he looked into Sissy's eyes for\r\nthe last time and knew himself forgiven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ASPECTS OF CONTEMPORARY ART.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of the present day succeeds to the art of past centuries not\r\nimmediately nor by an insensible gradation. It is preceded by an\r\ninterval of absolute deadness in matters artistic. Sixty years ago art\r\nin almost every branch was a sealed book to the majority of even\r\nwell-educated persons, and contentedly contemplated by them as such. All\r\nlove for it, with all knowledge of its history and all desire for its\r\ndevelopment, was for a generation or two confined to a few professed\r\nfollowers and a few devoted patrons, the mass of mankind thinking of it\r\nnot at all. But slowly a revival came in the main centres of\r\ncivilization--not much sooner in one than in another, though somewhat\r\ndifferently in each. In Germany we see it beginning with the famous\r\nTeutonic colony at Rome, reverent in spirit, cautious in method, severe\r\nin theory, restrained in style--culminating, on the one hand, in the\r\nacademic pietism of Overbeck, on the other in the deliberate majesty of\r\nCornelius. In France the new life begins with the successors of David,\r\nstrenuous, impetuous, jealous and innovating, Ingres and outline waging\r\ndeadly battle with color and Delacroix. In England architectural\r\nenthusiasm gave the first impulse, the \"Gothic Revival\" becoming the\r\nbasis of all subsequent work.\r\n\r\nIf, before noting the points of difference between one branch and\r\nanother of this modern art, we try to find the characteristics in which\r\nthese branches resemble one another, and by which they collectively are\r\ndistinguished from earlier developments, we find the most prominent one\r\nto be self-consciousness--not necessarily self-conceit, but the inward\r\nconsciousness that they _are_, and the endeavor to realize just what\r\nthey are. With these comes, when the art is conscientious, a desire to\r\ndiscover the noblest goal and to formulate the best methods of reaching\r\nit. Some, casting the horoscope for this struggling art of ours, find\r\nin these facts a great discouragement, believing that the vital germ of\r\nart is spontaneity--believing that there cannot again be a genuine form\r\nof art until there arise a fresh race of artists, unfed by the\r\nmummy-wheat of tradition, unfettered by the cere-cloths of criticism.\r\nOthers, more sanguine, believe that spontaneity has done all it can, and\r\nthat its place is in the future to be worthily filled by a wide\r\neclecticism. Let us inquire what testimony as to the value of\r\nspontaneity and the influence of self-consciousness in art may be\r\ngathered from the methods and results of the past, and what from a\r\ncontrast between the different contemporary schools in their methods and\r\ntheir results. Painting, as most prominently before our eyes and minds\r\njust now, will principally concern us.\r\n\r\nTo the making of every work of art go three things and no more--the\r\nmaterial worked upon, the hand that works, and the intellect or\r\nimagination which guides that hand. When the proportion is perfect\r\nbetween the three, the work of art is perfect of its kind. But in the\r\ndifferent kinds of art the necessary proportion is not the same. In\r\nmusic, for example, the medium is at its lowest value, the imagination\r\nat its highest. In architecture, on the other hand, material is most\r\nimportant. Musicians use the vibration of string and atmosphere,\r\nsculptors use bronze and marble, painters use color and canvas, poets\r\nuse rhythm and rhyme, as vehicles to express their ideas. The\r\narchitect's ideas are for the sake of his material. He takes his\r\nmaterial as such, and embellishes it with his ideas--creates beauty\r\nmerely by disposing its masses and enriching its surface. But in all and\r\neach of these processes, whether mind predominate or matter, there comes\r\nin as a further necessary factor the actual technical manipulation.\r\nPoetic visions and a noble mother-tongue do not constitute a man a poet\r\nif he cannot treat that language nobly according to the technique of his\r\nart. Nor, though Ariel sing in his brain and the everlasting harp of the\r\natmosphere wait for him, is he a musician if he have not a sensitive\r\near and a knowledge of counter-point. More notably yet does the\r\nhand--and in this as a technical term I include the other bodily powers\r\nwhich go to form technical skill,--more notably yet does the hand come\r\nin play with the painter. Here the material is little, the imagination\r\nmighty indeed, but less overwhelming than with poet and musician; but\r\nthe technique, the God-given and labor-trained cunning of retina and\r\nwrist, how all-important! often how all-sufficing!\r\n\r\nIn all criticism it is necessary first to reflect which of these three\r\nfactors--intellectual power, physical endowment or propitious\r\nmaterial--is most imperious. When we find this factor most perfectly\r\ndeveloped, and the others, though subordinate, neither absent nor\r\nstunted, we shall find the art nearest to perfection. And the conditions\r\nof race and climate and society which most helpfully develop that factor\r\nwithout injuring the others are the conditions which will best further\r\nthat art. And the critic who lays most stress on that factor, and is\r\ncontent to miss, if necessary, though noting the loss, a certain measure\r\nof the other two in order more entirely to gain the one that is\r\nvitalest, is the critic whose words are tonic. And he who, blending the\r\nprovince of the arts, calling them all with vagueness \"art,\" exalts and\r\ndemands the same factor first in all of them, must be detrimental, no\r\nmatter how great his sincerity and his knowledge.\r\n\r\nBefore weighing any contemporary thing in the balance let us mark out in\r\nthe past some standards of comparison. For it is useless to speculate\r\nupon theoretical methods if we can discover the actual methods employed\r\nby those whose art, if not ideally perfect, is yet so far beyond our\r\npresent power as to be quite perfectly ideal. It needs no discussion to\r\nprove that to find the utmost that has been actually accomplished by\r\nhuman endeavor we must turn in sculpture and in language to Greece, in\r\nmusic to Germany, in architecture to Greece or to mediaeval Europe as our\r\ntaste may pull, and in painting to the Italians.\r\n\r\nThe primary conception of art in its productive energy is as a certain\r\ninspiration. How did that inspiration work in those whom we acknowledge\r\nto have received it in fullest measure? If we think a moment we shall\r\nsay, \"Involuntarily\"--by a sort of _possession_ rather than a voluntary\r\nintellectual effort. The sculpture of the Greeks, their tragedies and\r\ntheir temples, were all wrought simply, without effort, without\r\nconscious travailing, by a natural evolution, not by a potent\r\negg-hatching process of instructive criticism and morbid self-inspection\r\nand consulting of previous models, native and foreign. Architectural\r\nmotives were gathered from Egypt and the East, from Phoenicia and\r\nAnatolia, but they were worked in as material, not copied as patterns;\r\nand the architecture is as original as if no one had ever built before.\r\nPhidias and Praxiteles and the rest shaped and chiselled, aiming at\r\nperfection no doubt, trying to do their best, but without troubling\r\nthemselves as to what that best \"ought\" to be. Criticism was rife in\r\nAthens of all places, but it was a criticism of things existing, not of\r\nthings problematically desirable. Statue and temple-front were\r\ncriticised, not sculptor and architect--surely not sculpture and\r\narchitecture in the abstract. Not sculptors and architects, that is,\r\nwhen the question was of their works. The men came in for their share of\r\ncriticism, but on a different count. Theseus and Athene were judged as\r\nworks of art, not as lame though interesting revelations of Phidias's\r\nsoul. And be sure no faintest sin of the chisel was excused on the plea\r\nthat Phidias meant more than he could express, and so bungled in the\r\nexpression. Nor was the plea advanced that such bungling after the\r\ninfinite was better than simple perfection in the attainable. An artist\r\nwas called upon to be an artist, not a poet nor a philosopher nor a\r\nmoralist. When Plato confounded them all in a splendid confusion of\r\ncriticism the fruit-time had gone by. There was left but to expatiate on\r\nthe hoard which summer had bequeathed, or to speculate, if he chose, on\r\nthe possible yield of a future and most problematical year.\r\n\r\nIn the rich Italian summer one sees the same thing. Men paint because\r\nthey must--because put at anything else they come back to art as iron to\r\nthe magnet. Not because art is lovely, nor because to be an artist is a\r\ndesirable or a noble or a righteous thing, but because they are artists\r\nborn, stamped, double-dyed, and, kick as they might, they could be\r\nnothing else--if not artists creative, yet artists critical and\r\nappreciative. Truly, they think and strive over their art, write\r\ntreatises and dogmas and speculations, vie with and rival and outdo each\r\nother. But it is their _art_ they discuss, not themselves, not one\r\nanother--technical methods, practical instruction, questions of pigment\r\nand model and touch, of perspective and chiaroscuro and varnish, not\r\npsychological aesthetics, biographical and psychical explanations as to\r\nfacts of canvas and color. What is done is what is to be criticised.\r\nWhat can be done technically is what should be done theoretically, and\r\nwhat cannot be done with absolute and perfect technical success is out\r\nof the domain of art once and for ever. As the Greek did not try to\r\ncarve marble eyelashes, so no Venetian tried to put his conscience on a\r\npanel. All Lionardo could see of Mona Lisa's soul he might paint, not\r\nall he could feel of Lionardo's. Mr. Ruskin himself quotes Duerer's note\r\nthat Raphael sent him his drawings, not to show his soul nor his\r\ntheories, but simply _seine Hand zu weisen_--to prove his touch. In\r\nRaphael's touch was implied Raphael's eye, and those two made the artist\r\nRaphael.\r\n\r\nNothing strikes one more in these men than the oblivion of self in their\r\nwork. Only one of the first-rank men was self-conscious, and he, the\r\nmost mighty as a man, is by no means the first as an artist. And even\r\nMichael Angelo had not the self-consciousness of to-day: it requires a\r\nclique of commentators and a brotherhood of artists equally infected to\r\ndevelop that. But just so far as he tried to put his mighty self into\r\nhis work, just so far he failed of artistic perfection; and not every\r\none is Michael Angelo to make even failure beautifully colossal. In\r\narchitecture, which in his day was already a dead art to be galvanized,\r\nnot alive and manly like the art of the painter, his self-consciousness\r\nshows most strongly and his failure is most conspicuous. Here he did not\r\ncreate, but avowedly composed--set himself deliberately to study the\r\npast and to decide what was best for the future. And upon none but him\r\nrests the blame of having driven out of the semi-unconscious,\r\nsemi-original Renaissance style what elements of power it had, and sent\r\nit reeling down through two centuries crazed with conceit and distorted\r\nwith self-inspection.\r\n\r\nOn the unconscious development of mediaeval architecture, due to no one\r\nman, but to a universal interest in and appreciation of the art, it is\r\nunnecessary to dwell. Nor need we for present purposes seek further\r\nillustration farther afield. Let us take time now to look more narrowly\r\nat the art of to-day, and try to mark the different shapes it has taken\r\nwith different nations.\r\n\r\nThe most decided school is in France: her artists, many in number,\r\nconfine, whether involuntarily or not, their individual differences\r\nwithin sharply-marked and easily-noted limits. In Germany the schools\r\nare two--one of so-called historical painting at Munich, one of what we\r\nmay name domestic painting at Duesseldorf. This last may be put on one\r\nside as having no specially obtrusive characteristics, and by German\r\npictures will be meant those of the Munich and Vienna type, whether\r\nactually from the studios of Munich and Vienna or not. In English\r\ncontemporary art can one pretend to find a school at all in any true\r\nsense of the word? What we do find is a very widespread art-literature\r\nand talk of art, a large number of working artists varying in\r\ntemperament, and a vast horde of amateurs, who are not content to be\r\npatrons, but yearn also to be practisers of art.\r\n\r\nIn England theories of art are more carefully discussed and more widely\r\ndiffused than they are in any other country. But they are theories of an\r\nessentially untechnical, amateurish, literary kind. The English critic\r\ncalls all law and philosophy, all rules of morals and manners, of\r\nreligion and political economy and science and scientific aesthetics, to\r\naid his critical faculty when he needs must speak of pictures. In\r\nGermany there is also much theorizing, but of a different kind. It is\r\nnot so much the whole physical and psychical cosmos that the German\r\ncritic studies as the past history of art in its most recondite phases\r\nand most subtle divergences. Upon this he draws for information as to\r\nthe value of the work before him. On the other hand, we shall find\r\nFrench art-criticism to be almost purely technical.\r\n\r\nAs the critics differ, so do the criticised by the natural law of\r\nnational coherence. An English painter is apt to be primarily an\r\nembodied theory of one sort or another; which theory is more or less\r\ndirectly connected with his actual work as a painter. A German painting\r\nis apt to be scientifically composed on theory also, but a theory drawn\r\nfrom the study of art _per se_, not of the whole world external to art.\r\nThe work of a Frenchman, like the criticism of his commentator, is\r\nprimarily technical.\r\n\r\nBecause both German work and English work are theoretical compared with\r\nFrench, I do not wish to imply that technically they are on a par. Aside\r\nfrom the difference of imaginative power in the two nations, which\r\nrenders German conceptions more valuable in every way than contemporary\r\nEnglish ideas, there is a great difference in the technical training of\r\nthe two groups of artists. German work often shows technical qualities\r\nas notable as those we find in France, though of another kind. The noble\r\nphysical endowment of an artist--that by reason of which, and by reason\r\nof which alone, he _is_ an artist--is twofold: power of eye and power of\r\nhand. By power of the eye I mean simple vision exalted into a special\r\ngift, a special appreciation of line, an ultra delicate and profound\r\nperception of color, and an exact, unconscious memory. This last is not\r\nimagination nor imaginative memory, but an automatic power, if I may so\r\nsay, of the retina--as unconscious as is the pianist's memory of his\r\nnotes, and as unerring. It is not the power to fix in the mind by\r\nconscious effort the objects before one, and to recall them\r\ndeliberately, inch by inch, at any time, but the power, when the brush\r\npauses trembling for the signal, to put down unerringly facts learned\r\nGod knows where, or imagined God knows how. Automatic, I repeat, this\r\npower must be. The tongue might not be able to tell, nor the mind\r\ndeliberately to recall in cold blood, what was the depth of blue on a\r\ndistant hill or the vagueness of its outlines, or what the anatomical\r\nstructure of a mistress's fingers. But the brush knows, as nothing but\r\nthe brush of an artist can; and when it comes to painting them, aerial\r\nperspective and anatomical detail _must_ come right. This is the first\r\nand the great endowment. And the second is like unto it in--Shall I use\r\nthe fashionable artistic slang and say _preciousness_? It is the gift of\r\na dexterous hand, winged with lightness and steady as steel, sensitive\r\nas a blind man's finger-tips, yet unerring in its stroke as the piston\r\nof a steamship. This is a gift as well as the other, but it can, far\r\nmore than the other, be improved and developed by practice and patience.\r\nBoth gifts in equal perfection constitute a technical master. It is\r\nhardly necessary to say that no man--certainly no nation--can to-day\r\nclaim the highest measure of both. The French are most highly gifted\r\nwith the first, the Germans with the second. In the latter, patience and\r\nscience, working upon a natural aptitude, have developed great strength\r\nand accuracy of wrist, and with this the power of composition and\r\ndesign, purity and accuracy of outline, and good chiaroscuro. But the\r\nwhole race is deficient in a sense of color. Its work is marked by\r\ncrudeness and harshness, or at the best reticence--splendor without\r\nsoftness or inoffensiveness without charm. In cases where much is\r\nattempted in color--as in what is undoubtedly one of the best of\r\ncontemporary paintings, Knille's _Tannhaeuser and Venus_ in the Berlin\r\nGallery--the success is by no means on a par with the great excellence\r\nof drawing and composition. In France the eye for color is present--I\r\nwill not say as in Venice, but to a greater degree than in the two other\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nIf we leave now professional painters and professional critics and turn\r\nto the untrained public, we shall find, of course, all our modern faults\r\nmore evident. The English public is pre-eminently untechnical in its\r\njudgments, pre-eminently literary or moral. But the French and the\r\nGerman public approximate more to the English--as is natural--than do\r\ntheir respective artists. I use the word _literary_ as it has often been\r\nused by others in characterizing the popular art-criticism of the\r\ntime--and in England much of the professional criticism also--to denote\r\na prominence given to the subject, the idea, the story--_l'anecdote_, as\r\na French critic calls it--over the purely painter's work of a picture.\r\nIt denotes the theory that a picture is not first to please the sense,\r\nbut to catch the fancy or the intellect or to touch the heart. This\r\nfeeling, which in France turns toward sensationalism, in England toward\r\nsentimentality, is something other than the interest which attaches to\r\nhistorical painting as the record of facts--in itself not the highest\r\ninterest one can find in a work of art. If we think back for a moment, we\r\nshall see how different from either of these moods was the mood in which\r\nthe great Italians painted. Some \"subject\" of course a painting must\r\nhave that is not a portrait, but these men chose instinctively--hardly,\r\nit is to be supposed, theoretically--such subjects as were most familiar\r\nto their public, and therefore least likely to engage attention\r\nprimarily, and to the exclusion of the absolute pictorial value of the\r\npainting as such. We never find Titian telling anecdotes. His portraits\r\nare quiescence itself--portraits of men and women standing in the\r\nfulness of beauty and strength to be painted by Titian. We do not find\r\nlikenesses snatched in some occurrence of daily life or in some dramatic\r\naction of historical or biographical importance. Even Raphael's great\r\nfrescoes are symbolical more truly than historical, expressing the\r\nsignificance of a whole series of events rather than literally rendering\r\none single event. The first remark of many who, accustomed to the\r\nliterary interest of modern pictures, are for the first time making\r\nacquaintance with the old masters, is, that the galleries are so\r\nunexcitingly monotonous: the subjects are not interesting. Portraits,\r\nscenes from sacred history or Greek mythology,--that is all among the\r\nItalians. Desiring nothing but beauty of line and color, and\r\nexpressiveness provided it was beautiful, they sought a subject merely\r\nas the _raison d'etre_ of beauty. Raphael could paint the Madonna and\r\nChild a score of times, and Veronese his _Marriages of Cana_, and all of\r\nthem Magdalenes and St. Sebastians by the dozen, without thinking of\r\nfinding fresh subjects to excite fresh interest. Nor does this\r\nrestricted range of subjects imply, under the hand of a master,\r\nmonotony. There is more unlikeness in Raphael's Madonnas than in the\r\nfigures of any modern artist, whatever their variety of name and action.\r\nEven a century later than Raphael, among the Flemings and Hollanders,\r\nthe best pictures are the simplest, the least dependent for their\r\ninterest upon anything dramatic or anecdotal in their subject. The\r\ntriumphs of the Dutch school are the portraits of the guilds. The\r\nmasterpieces of Rubens are his children and single figures and biblical\r\nscenes, not his _Marie de Medicis_. And what of Rembrandt is so perfect\r\nas his _Saskia with the Pink_ at Dresden? If we have a photograph even\r\nof such a picture as this constantly before us, with a modern picture of\r\nanecdotal interest, no matter how vivid and pleasant that interest may\r\nhave been at first, it is not hard to predict which will please us\r\nlongest--which will grow to be an element in the happiness of every day,\r\nwhile the other becomes at last _fade_ and insipid. This even if we\r\nsuppose its technical excellence to be great. How, then, shall such\r\ninterest take the place of technical excellence?\r\n\r\nThis modern love of _l'anecdote_ is not exactly the cause perhaps, nor\r\nyet the effect, of the self-consciousness of modern art, but it goes\r\nhand in hand with it: they are manifestations of the same spirit in the\r\ntwo different spheres of worker and spectator.\r\n\r\nBut it may be said, If Michael Angelo was self-conscious, it was\r\nbecause he first caught the infection of modern times. Life, the world,\r\nthe nineteenth century, are self-conscious through and through. It is\r\nimpossible to be otherwise. It is impossible for a world which has lived\r\nthrough what ours has, which has recorded its doings and sufferings and\r\nspeculations for our benefit, ever to be naive or spontaneous in\r\nanything. Inspiration unsought and unquestioned is a thing of the past.\r\nStudy, reflection, absorption, eclecticism,--these are the watchwords of\r\nthe future. If this were granted, many would still think it an open\r\nquestion whether art of the highest kind would in the future be possible\r\nor not. But is by no means necessary to grant it, for we have had in the\r\nmost learned and speculative of nations an art in our century--still\r\nsurviving, indeed, in our very midst--the growth of which has been as\r\nrapid and the flowering as superb as the growth and bloom of sculpture\r\nin Greece or of painting in Italy. I mean, of course, music in Germany.\r\nAnd if we think a moment we shall see that its growth was as\r\nunpremeditated, its direction and development as unbiassed by theories,\r\nits votaries as untroubled with self-consciousness, as if they had been\r\narchaic sculptors or builders of the thirteenth century. Bach, Haydn,\r\nMozart, Beethoven, Mendelssohn, what sublime unconsciousness of their\r\nown personality as the personality of artists and as influencing art!\r\nDoes Richard Wagner seem at first sight to be a glaring exception to\r\nsuch a rule--seem to strive more than any other artist in any branch of\r\nart to be critic as well--seem, perhaps, to be most notably\r\nself-conscious even in an age of self-consciousness? The most highly\r\ngifted of the generation as an artist, his musical talent developed\r\nspontaneously, irresistibly. It had thus developed before he began to\r\nreason about it, to justify in theory that which had approved itself in\r\nfact. His power lies in the union we find in him of musician and\r\ndramatist. His dogmatizing and theorizing expatiate not on the way he\r\nworks in either art, but on the propriety of combining the two. Not his\r\ntheories, but his artist's instinct, taught him how to do it as it is\r\ndone in the _Meistersinger_. His theories try to explain his work, but\r\nby just so much as his work is consciously founded on his theories, by\r\njust so much is it less perfect than it would have been had he preserved\r\nhis unconsciousness. The fact of his self-consciousness tends in many\r\neyes to mark him as the rearguard of a line of artists, the pioneer of a\r\ngeneration of critical musicians. May Liszt perhaps serve as a sample of\r\nsuch--learned, critical, self-conscious, productive, but unoriginal? And\r\nthe worst sign in Germany is less that the young musicians copy Wagner\r\nthan that they copy him not instinctively and by nature, but\r\ntheoretically and of deliberate intent, exalting his theories to rank\r\nbeside his work.\r\n\r\nIt seems at first strange that, music being at once the glory and the\r\nrecreation of the whole German nation, and a knowledge of it being\r\nnative to the vast majority of individual Germans, there is little\r\nexisting musical criticism--none as compared with the abounding German\r\ncriticism on every other branch of art and every other subject under the\r\nsun. The field offered here to the cobweb-spinning German brain is wide\r\nand attractive. It seems strange that it should be as yet uncultivated,\r\nunless we fall back on the theory that art at its vitalest is of\r\nnecessity uncritical, and that where an inborn love of, and aptitude\r\nfor, an art exists with a daily enjoyment of its technical perfection,\r\nwe shall be least likely to find it elaborately criticised\r\ntheoretically. Where practice is abundantly satisfactory theories are\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nBelow, though still in the same category with, the musical gift of the\r\nGermans we may cite the literary gift of the English. For though this\r\nmay not be the greatest literary epoch of England, yet it will not be\r\ndenied that the greatest of English aptitudes is for literature. The\r\nwide appreciation of it in England is unmatched by a like appreciation\r\nof any other form of art. The growth of English novel-writing and its\r\nhealthy development, accompanied, it may be, by many fungus-growths due\r\nto over-fertility, afford us the spectacle of a contemporary yet\r\nspontaneous English art, unforced by hothouse cultivation, uninfluenced\r\nby theories. A century or so hence the hearty, unconscious bloom of\r\nnarrative literature in our day and language may seem as strange as\r\nseems to us the spontaneous blossoming of Venetian painting, of Greek\r\nsculpture, or of architecture in the Ile de France. An Englishman of\r\nto-day who thinks painters can be spun out of theories would surely\r\nlaugh with instinctive knowledge of the veritable requirements of their\r\nart if one were to propose supplying novelists or poets in a similar\r\nway.\r\n\r\nIf we thus acknowledge that two kinds of art--and those two requiring\r\nthe greatest amount of imaginative power--can flourish with spontaneity\r\neven in so self-conscious a civilization as ours, we shall fail to see\r\nin that civilization a sufficient _a priori_ reason why the same might\r\nnot have been the case with painting. If, however, still keeping to our\r\nown day, we look for the reverse of this picture, we shall find some\r\napproach to it in the condition of the painter's art in England. Here\r\ntheory runs wild, practice falls far behind, and a great part of the\r\npractice that exists is inspired and regulated by theory. Artists are\r\nespecially self-conscious, and the public, while much concerned with\r\nthings artistic and fed on daily food of art-theory and speculation, is\r\nspecially devoid of an innate artistic sense and an educated faculty for\r\nappreciating technical perfection.\r\n\r\nIn England, more even than on the Continent or with ourselves, is there\r\na passion for story-telling with the brush, a desire to give ideas\r\ninstead of pictures, a denial of the fact that the main object of a\r\npicture is to please the eye just as truly and as surely as the main\r\nobject of a symphony is to please the ear. If we look through the\r\ncatalogue of a Royal Academy exhibition, we notice the preponderance of\r\nscenes illustrative of English or other literature--of canvases that\r\ntell a story or point a moral or bear a punning or a sentimental title.\r\nAnd we notice the great number of quotations introduced into the\r\ncatalogue without any actual explanatory necessity. Even landscapes are\r\ndragged into the domain of sentiment, and Mr. Millais, who copies Nature\r\nwith the exactest reverence, cannot call his brook a brook, but \"The\r\nsound of many waters;\" and a graveyard is not named a graveyard, but\r\n\"Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap;\" and instead of\r\n_Winding the Clock_ we are told \"The clock beats out the life of little\r\nmen.\" A canvas representing \"untrodden snow\" must be ticketed, for\r\nincrease of interest, \"Within three miles of Charing Cross.\" Another is\r\nmarked, \"Christmas Eve: a welcome to old friends. (See _Silas Marner_.)\"\r\nAnd so on, _ad infinitum_. May one not say _ad nauseam_ before a piece\r\nof marble labelled \"Baby doesn't like the water,\" or a canvas by Faed,\r\nR. A., called \"Little cold tooties,\" or the portrait by the president of\r\nthe Academy of a child on her pony denoted not only by the child's name\r\nin full, but her pony's also?\r\n\r\nProminent also at a first visit to a London exhibition stands out the\r\nhesitancy; of English artists to deal with large canvases and life-size\r\nfigures--their strict confinement to _genre_ of a domestic or bookishly\r\narchaeological type. This is not the place to discuss the causes of such\r\na fact, nor to insist on the lack of certain technical qualities in even\r\nthe best English work. Such discussions can only be profitable when the\r\noriginals are at hand to recriticise the criticism.\r\n\r\nMore striking than anything to be seen in 1877 at the Royal Academy was\r\nthe small collection of pictures at the Grosvenor Gallery, organized and\r\ncontrolled by a noble amateur--himself a painter also--with the avowed\r\nintention of exhibiting the latest and most eccentric phases of English\r\nart. To a Londoner the opening day was interesting, as revealing the\r\nnewest works of the most conspicuous London artists. To a stranger fresh\r\nfrom continental pictures, old and new, eager to see the touch of hands\r\nso often described in print, it was a revelation not only of a few men's\r\nwork, but of the tendency of a national art and the artistic\r\ntemperament of a whole people. Superficially, these pictures seemed the\r\nexact opposite of those at the conservative Academy--as aberrant as the\r\nlatter were commonplace. But to one who knew them as the work of a\r\nfashionable, highly-educated clique they seemed merely a reaction of the\r\nsame spirit that produced the elder style. In striving to get out of the\r\nrut of commonplace which had so long held in its grip the wheels of\r\nEnglish art, not originality, so much as deliberate, sought-out\r\neccentricity, was the result. The scale of work, starting from the\r\noriginal bathos of domestic sentimentality, runs up to the veriest\r\ncontortions of affected mediaevalism, rarely striking out a note of\r\ncommon sense. Simple English art is the apotheosis of the British\r\nmiddle-class spirit, of Mr. Arnold's \"Philistinism.\" English art\r\ndeparting from this spirit shows, not Mr. Arnold's \"sweetness and\r\nlight,\" not calmness, repose, sureness of self, unconsciousness of its\r\nown springs of life, but theories running into vague contradictions, a\r\nfar-fetched abnormalness, a morbid conception of beauty, a defiant\r\ndisregard of the fact that a public exists which judges by common sense\r\nand the eye, not by a fine-spun confusion of theories and an undefined\r\nbut omnipotent and deified \"aesthetic sense\" non-resident in the optic\r\nnerve. Mr. Whistler's pictures to-day, cleverly as he can paint if he\r\nwill, are not pictures--I do not mean in fact, which is certainly\r\ntrue--but in title. They are \"Natures in Black and Gold,\" or \"In Blue\r\nand Silver,\" or \"In Blue and Gold,\" or \"Arrangements in Black,\" or\r\n\"Harmonies in Amber and Brown.\" Here we have the desperate reaction from\r\nthe idea that _l'anecdote_ is everything to the idea that it is\r\nsufficient to represent nothing (poetically conceived!) with little\r\ncolor and less form, with the vaguest and slightest and most untechnical\r\ntechnique. It is hard to say which would most puzzle Titian\r\nredivivus--\"Little cold tooties,\" or a blue-gray wash with a point or\r\ntwo of yellow, bearing some imaginary resemblance to the Thames with its\r\ngaslights, and called a \"Nocturne in Blue and Gold.\"\r\n\r\nThe French \"impressionalist\" clique, similar in spirit to these\r\nEnglishmen, though less outre in practice, is not by any means of so\r\ngreat importance in France as they are in England. It has more than once\r\nbeen remarked in England that the old-fashioned amateur--patron and\r\ncritic, _kenner_--is dying out, and that his modern substitute must not\r\nonly choose, but experiment--not only admire, but be admired. This\r\nspirit, spreading through a nation, will not make it a nation of\r\nartists, but will make the nation's artists amateurs. No critic, no\r\namateur, is more loath to try his own hand than the one who most deeply\r\nand rightly appreciates the skill of others, and the rare and God-given\r\nand difficult nature of that skill. The confusion of amateur with\r\nprofessional work lowers the standard, so there will be every year fewer\r\nto tell the mass of the nation that most useful of truths--how earnest a\r\nthing is true art, and how rare a native appreciation of its truest\r\nworth.\r\n\r\nThere is no place where the interest excited by national art is so\r\nwidespread, where the exhibitions are so crowded, where they so regulate\r\ntimes and seasons, annual excursions to and departures from town, as in\r\nEngland. Yet there is no place where the interest in art seems to a\r\nstranger so factitious, so much a matter of fashion and custom, of\r\ninstinctive following of chance-appointed bell-wethers. It would\r\nscarcely be a matter of surprise if the whole thing should collapse\r\nthrough some pin-thrust of rival interest or excitement, and next year's\r\nexhibition be a desert, next year's artists paint their theories and\r\ntheir souls for unregarding eyes, or rather for unheeding brains. Have\r\nwe not an apology for such a suggestion in the history of the rage for\r\nGothic architecture, so thoroughly demonstrated in every possible\r\ntheoretical and philosophical way to be the only proper style for\r\nEnglishmen present or future, so devotedly and exclusively followed for\r\na while by the profession, only to be suddenly abandoned for its fresher\r\nrivals, the so-called styles of Queen Elizabeth and Queen Anne?\r\n\r\nIn the throngs that flocked to the opening of the Royal Academy, waiting\r\nhours before the doors were opened, fighting and struggling for a\r\nfoothold on the stairs, eager to be the first to see, though there were\r\nweeks of opportunities ahead--in the rare recurrence through the hum of\r\nthe vast criticising crowd of a word of technical judgment or sober\r\nartistic criticism--it was easy to recognize the same spirit that\r\nconfuses morality with chair-legs, that finds a knocker more \"sincere\"\r\nand \"right\" than a door-bell, that insists as upon a vital necessity\r\nthat the heads of all nails should be visible and that all lines should\r\nbe straight, and would as soon have a shadow on its conscience as in the\r\npattern of wall-paper. Nowhere was decorative art so non-existent a few\r\nyears ago as in England--nowhere is it so universally dwelt upon to-day.\r\nYet it is easy to see how entirely the revival is a child of theory and\r\nbooks and teachers and rules--how little owing to a spontaneous\r\ndevelopment of art-instinct in the people, a spontaneous desire for more\r\nbeauty in their surroundings, a spontaneous knowledge of how it is best\r\nto be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe literary and un-painterlike--if I may use such an awkward\r\nterm--nature of English art is shown perhaps more forcibly in its\r\ncritics than in artists or public. One is especially struck in reading\r\ncriticisms of whatever grade with the excessive prominence given to the\r\nartist's personality. The work of this year is judged not so much by its\r\nexcellence as by comparison with the work of last year. A----'s\r\npictures, and B----'s and C----'s and D----'s, are interesting and\r\nvaluable mainly as showing A----'s improvement, or B----'s falling off,\r\nor C----'s unexpected change of theme, or D----'s fine mind and delicate\r\nsensibilities.\r\n\r\nMr. Ruskin is without doubt the most remarkable of English critics, and\r\nsummarizes so many opposite theories and tendencies that his pages may\r\nin some sort be taken as an epitome of the whole matter. It would be\r\nimpossible to abstract from their great bulk any consecutive or\r\nconsistent system of thought or precept. His influence has been mainly\r\nby isolated ideas of more or less truth and value. It is impossible here\r\nto analyze his work. Such is the mixed tissue of his woof that the\r\ncaptive princess who was set to sort a roomful of birds' feathers had\r\nscarcely a harder task than one who should try to separate and classify\r\nhis threads, some priceless and steady, some rotten, false, misleading.\r\nMorals, manners, religion, political economy, are mixed with art in\r\nevery shape--art considered theoretically and technically, historically,\r\nphilosophically and prophetically. Various as are his views on these\r\nvarying subjects, on no one subject even do they remain invariable. Yet\r\nsuch is the charm of his style, delightfully sarcastic, and eloquent as\r\na master's brush, so vividly is each idea presented in itself, that,\r\neach idea being enjoyed as it comes, all seem at first of equal value.\r\nWe realize neither the fallacy of many taken singly nor the conflict of\r\nall taken together. His points are often cleverly and faithfully put,\r\nand our attention is so riveted on this cleverness and faithfulness that\r\nwe take for granted the rightness of his deductions, slovenly, illogical\r\nor false though they may be. What we most remark in his books is how the\r\npurely artistic element in his nature--of a very high grade and very\r\ntrue instincts--is dwarfed of full development and stunted of full\r\nresults by the theorizing literary bent which he has in common with his\r\ntime and people. In theorizing even on truly-felt and clearly-stated\r\nfacts, in explaining their origin and unfolding their effects, his\r\nguidance is least valuable. We may more safely ask him _what_ than\r\n_why_. His influence on English art has been great at the instant:\r\nwhether it will be permanent is doubtful. At one time it was said that\r\nwithout having read his books one could tell by an inspection of the\r\nRoyal Academy walls what Mr. Ruskin had written in the past year. Now,\r\nthe most notable exponents of his teaching, whether consciously so or\r\nnot, are on the one hand the shining lights of the Grosvenor\r\nGallery--hierophants of mysticism and allegory and symbolism and\r\npainted souls and moral beauty expressed in the flesh, copying Ruskin's\r\n_Botticelli_ line for line, forgetting that what was naivete in him, and\r\nin him admirable, because all before him had done so much less well,\r\nbecomes to-day in them the direst affectation, is reprehensible in them\r\nbecause many before them have done so much better. On the other hand, we\r\nhave a naturalistic throng which follows Mr. Ruskin's precepts when he\r\noverweights the other side of the scale and says that art should \"never\r\nexist alone, never for itself,\" never except as \"representing a\r\ntrue\"--defined as actually-existing--\"thing or decorating a useful\r\nthing;\" when he declares that every attempt by the imagination to \"exalt\r\nor refine healthy humanity has weakened or caricatured it.\" Mr. Ruskin\r\nbade men \"go to Nature in all singleness of heart, and walk with her\r\nlaboriously and trustingly, having no other thought but how best to\r\npenetrate her meaning, _rejecting nothing, selecting nothing and\r\nscorning nothing_;\" and Mr. Hamerton was literally obeying him when he\r\nexiled himself for five years in a hut on an island in a bleak Scotch\r\nlake to learn faithfully to portray the shores of that single lake. Was\r\nit thus that Titian studied in his youth, and learned how, years after\r\nin Venice, to paint the chestnuts and the hills of Cadore a\r\nthousand-fold more artistically and more truly, because more abstractly\r\nand more ideally, than could all the \"pre-Raphaelite\" copyists of\r\nto-day? Thus we see the two extremes of Mr. Ruskin's teaching--see him\r\nat one time exalting imagination and feeling over the pictorial part of\r\nart, at another degrading art into the servilest copying.\r\n\r\nObservers may disagree as to whether these cognate\r\nthings--self-consciousness in the artist, aesthetic philosophizing in the\r\ncritic, and the taste for a literary rather than a pictorial value in\r\nthe public--are on the increase or on the decrease in the various\r\ncentres of art. Annual exhibitions--a significant illustration of our\r\nhigh-pressure life in art as in other things--would seem to tend toward\r\ndeepening these faults. Attention must be attracted at all hazards, and\r\nthe greater the number of exhibitors and the average attractiveness of\r\ntheir canvases the greater becomes the temptation to shine, not by\r\nexcellence, but by eccentricities of treatment, or, still more, by the\r\nfactitious interest of a \"telling\" subject. Is it due, perhaps, to this\r\nconstant desire for notoriety on the part of the artist, and for more\r\nand more excitement on the part of the public, that in all modern\r\nschools, landscape art, as less possibly influenced by such a state of\r\nthings, stands ahead of the art which has humanity for its subject? It\r\nis scarcely possible to find in France to-day a figure-painter who is a\r\nDaubigny, still less a Jules Dupre. Next to these unquestionably stand\r\nsuch animal-painters as Bonheur and Troyon; and it would be hard among\r\nthe youngest file of artists to find a figure-painter who in his line\r\nshould rival Van Marcke in his. In England also landscape ranks ahead,\r\nand it is perhaps in comparing it with French landscape that the\r\ndifference between the schools is most truly though not most glaringly\r\ndisplayed. Even here, and in the allied fields of animal-painting, the\r\ndesire for _l'anecdote_ creeps in, and Landseer with all his talent\r\noften prostitutes his brush in the attempt to make his brutes the centre\r\nof dramatic action, and forces into them semi-human characteristics in\r\norder to extract from them tales or ideas of human interest. It was not\r\nthus that Veronese painted dogs or Franz Snyders his lions and\r\nboars--not thus that the Greeks have put the horse into art. Nor, to\r\ntake the best contemporary comparison, is it thus that Barye's bronzes\r\nare designed.\r\n\r\nLandscape brings us inevitably to Turner. The most highly gifted of all\r\nEnglish artists, past or present, his genius was hardly a logical\r\noutcome of the contemporary spirit of his nation. We have no right to\r\nsay this of an artist, no right to call him anomalous, while we are\r\nstill in doubt as to whether he may be only the advance-guard of a new\r\nnational art, the herald of a new avatar. But when he with his\r\ngeneration dies, when another generation develops and bears fruit, and\r\na third is beginning to blossom, and he still seems anomalous, it is\r\nfair to hold him exceptional in his country's art, rather than\r\ncharacteristic thereof. Together with wonderful endowments of eye and\r\nhand, and a prodigious power of work, Turner's earlier works show us an\r\nunconscious development and a healthy oblivion of his own personality.\r\nBut later the fatal modern fever entered his blood, ending in something\r\nvery like delirium. From a painter he became a theorist, contaminated by\r\na rush of criticism alike indiscriminate in praise and injudicious in\r\nblame. We shall see the baleful effects of modern methods if we look, in\r\nthe wonderful series at the National Gallery, first at the pictures\r\npainted when Turner was an artist thinking of painting, then to those\r\ndone when he was a self-conscious experimentalist thinking of\r\nTurner--Turner worshipped by Ruskin, Turner sick with envy of the\r\nDutchmen and defiance of Claude.\r\n\r\nI have but a line to give to the one or two other men of abnormally\r\nsplendid gifts whom this century has seen. Henri Regnault's\r\nextraordinary talent was extinguished almost at the first spark, and it\r\nis beyond prophecy to tell what it might have produced. His\r\neccentricities seem to have been quite genuine, due to an overflow of\r\npower rather than to posing or grimace. His love of his art, his passion\r\nfor color, were almost frantic in their intensity, but sincere. A\r\ncertain exaggerated phrase of his is but the protest of reaction against\r\nthe literary painting, the erudite and philosophical art, of his time.\r\n\"La vie,\" he cries, \"etant courte, il faut peindre tant qu'on a des\r\nyeux. Donc on ne doit pas les fatiguer a lire des stupides journaux.\" A\r\ncrude way of putting the idea that to be an artist one needs but art.\r\n\r\nAnother wonderful talent is Hans Makart. Such an eye for color, it is\r\nquite safe to say, has not been born since Veronese. Had he been born at\r\nVenice among his peers, forced to work instead of experiment, outvied\r\ninstead of foolishly extolled, surrounded by artists to surpass him if\r\nhe tripped for a single instant, instead of critics to laud his most\r\nglaring faults and amateurs to pay thousands for his spoiled paper, we\r\nshould have had another name to use as explanatory of genius. As it is,\r\nhe is, according to present indications, utterly spoiled. Only those who\r\nknow how he can draw if he will, how he has painted--portraits best,\r\nperhaps--when he would, are vexed beyond endurance by the folly and the\r\ncarelessness and the sins he chooses to give us. It has been said that\r\nRaphael Mengs was a born genius spoiled by the coldness, the\r\npseudo-classicism, the artificiality and eclecticism of the eighteenth\r\ncentury. A companion portrait is Hans Makart, ruined by the\r\namateurishness, the rhapsodizing, the theorizing, the morbid\r\nself-consciousness of the nineteenth.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Spanish school of to-day is as yet too new for us to see\r\nexactly whither it tends. Its passion for glaring, metallic, aniline\r\ncompound tints--tints that \"scream,\" to use a French phrase--its horror\r\nof all shade and depth and of pure and simple colors, are, however, most\r\ncertainly unhealthy. It is a diseased eye that in the desire for violent\r\ncolor loses all memory of chiaroscuro.\r\n\r\nI have left till now unnoticed the contemporary Netherland artists,\r\nthough their works are perhaps more entirely satisfactory than those of\r\neither of the three schools we have discussed. But their characteristics\r\nare less markedly distinct, less available for comparison, and can be\r\nbest noted and appraised by a previously-gained knowledge of the\r\npeculiarities of English, French and German painting. The Belgian school\r\nis most closely allied to the French, and in technique is often its\r\nequal. In landscape and cattle-painting the types are similar, while\r\nBelgian figure-painting gains by the lack of the element which a French\r\ncritic notes when he says modern art has become _mondain--surtout\r\ndemi-mondain_. Nowhere does contemporary art seem so healthy and sane,\r\nso sure of itself, so consonant with the best nature and gifts of the\r\npeople, as in the Netherlands: nowhere are its ideals so free from\r\nmorbidness, affectation or sentimentality. Is it perhaps that in the\r\nstudios of Amsterdam, in the great school of Antwerp, even in the\r\ngalleries of Brussels, one is somewhat out of the wildest stream of\r\nmodern life--less driven to analysis and theorizing and\r\nself-consciousness than in London, Paris or Munich? Whatever is cause,\r\nwhatever effect, the Netherland school shows two things side by\r\nside--the least measure of self-consciousness, and the soundest\r\ncontemporary painting: if not the most effective, it is, I think, the\r\nmost full of promise. There seems to be forming the most healthy\r\nnational soil for the development of future genius.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be noted that we in America, whose art is just\r\nbeginning even to strive, are subjected to a somewhat strange cross-fire\r\nof influences. Lineally the children of England, we are spiritually and\r\nby temperament in many things her opposites. Our taste in art seems to\r\nturn resolutely away from her. For each hundred of French and score of\r\nGerman pictures that comes to us, how many come from England? What can\r\none who has not crossed the sea learn of English pictures from our\r\nprivate collections and picture-dealers' shops? Was not all we knew\r\nprior to the Exhibition of 1876 gleaned from _Vernon Gallery_ plates and\r\nTurner's _Rogers_ or _Rivers of France_? But while our dealers and\r\nstudents and millionaires throng the studios of Paris and Munich, and\r\nour eyes are being daily educated to demand above all things\r\n_technique_, our brains are constantly being worked upon by a stream of\r\nart-literature from England. Taste pulls us one way--identity of English\r\nspeech, with consequent openness to English ideas, pulls us the other.\r\nPictures preach one thing, books another. Our boy who has worked in\r\nParis comes home to try to realize Ruskin. Both influences are too new,\r\nand our art is as yet too unsteady, for any one to guess as to the\r\nultimate result. One thing only can be unreservedly inculcated: Let us\r\nshun self-analyzation, self-consciousness, morbidness, affectation,\r\nattitudinizing. Let us look ahead as little as possible, keeping our\r\neyes on our brushes and on the world of beauty around us. One thing\r\nonly can with safety be predicted: If we are, or are to be, a people of\r\nartists, creative or appreciative as the case may be, we shall learn\r\nwhatever of technique the world has to teach us, and shall improve upon\r\nit, and we shall perhaps digest the small measure of theory for which we\r\nhave appetites left. But if we are _not_ artists, actual or future,\r\ntechnique will be impossible, and will seem undesirable. We shall\r\ngreedily fill our stomachs with the wind of art-philosophy, shall work\r\nwith the reason instead of with the eye and the fingers, shall symbolize\r\nour aspirations, our theorizings, our souls and our consciences, and\r\nfondly dream we are painting pictures. Or we shall copy with a hopeless\r\neffort after literalness the first face or weed we meet, and call the\r\nimperfect, mechanical result a work of art.\r\n\r\n  M. G. VAN RENSSELAER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE WATCHES\r\n\r\n\r\n  I sat in the silence, in moonlight that gathered and glowed\r\n    Far over the field and the forest with tender increase:\r\n  The low, rushing winds in the trees were like waters that flowed\r\n    From sources of passionate joy to an ocean of peace.\r\n  And I watched, and was glad in my heart, though the shadows were deep,\r\n    Till one came and asked me: \"Say, why dost thou watch through the\r\n        night?\"\r\n  And I said, \"I am watching my joy. They who sorrow may sleep,\r\n    But the soul that is glad cannot part with one hour of delight.\"\r\n\r\n  Again in the silence I watched, and the moon had gone down;\r\n    The shadows were hidden in darkness; the winds had passed by;\r\n  The midnight sat throned, and the jewels were bright in her crown,\r\n    For stars glimmered softly--oh softly!--from depths of the sky.\r\n  And I sighed as I watched all alone, till again came a voice:\r\n    \"Ah! why dost thou watch? Joy is over, and sorrow is vain.\"\r\n  And I said, \"I am watching my grief. Let them sleep who rejoice,\r\n    But the spirit that loves cannot part with one hour of its pain.\"\r\n\r\n  Once more I sat watching, in darkness that fell like a death--\r\n    The deep solemn darkness that comes to make way for the dawn:\r\n  I looked on the earth, and it slept without motion or breath,\r\n    And blindly I looked on the sky, but the stars were withdrawn.\r\n  And the voice spoke once more: \"Cease thy watching, for what dost\r\n        thou gain?\"\r\n    But I said, \"I am watching my soul, to this darkness laid bare.\r\n  Let them sleep to whom love giveth joy, to whom love giveth pain,\r\n    But the soul left alone cannot part with one moment of prayer.\"\r\n\r\n  MARION COUTHOUY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSISTER SILVIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nMonte Compatri is one of the eastern outlying peaks of the Alban\r\nMountains, and, like so many Italian mountains, has its road climbing to\r\nand fro in long loops to a gray little city at the top. This city of\r\nMonte Compatri is a full and busy hive, with solid blocks of houses, and\r\nthe narrowest of streets that break now and then into stairs. For those\r\nold builders respected the features of a landscape as though they had\r\nbeen the features of a face, and no more thought of levelling\r\ninequalities of land than of shaving down or raising up noses. When a\r\nman had a house-lot in a hollow, he built his house there, and made\r\nSteps to go down to it: his neighbor, who owned a rocky knoll, built his\r\nhouse at the top, and made stairs to go up to it. Moreover, if the land\r\nwas a bit in the city, the house was made in the shape of it, and was as\r\nlikely to have corners in obtuse or acute as in right angles.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of Monte Compatri have two streets of which they are\r\nimmensely proud--the Lungara, which wriggles through the middle of the\r\ntown, and the Giro, which makes the entire circuit of the town, leaving\r\noutside only the rim of houses that rise from the edge of the mountain,\r\nsome of them founded on the natural rock, others stretching roots of\r\nmasonry far down into the earth.\r\n\r\nOne of these houses on the Giro had for generations been in the\r\npossession of the Guai family. One after another had held it at an easy\r\nrent from Prince Borghese, the owner of the town. The vineyard and\r\norchard below in the Campagna they owned, and from those their wealth\r\nwas derived. For it was wealth for such people to have a house full of\r\nfurniture, linen and porcelain--where, perhaps, a connoisseur might have\r\nfound some rare bits of old china--besides having a thousand scudi in\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nIn this position was the head of the family when he died, leaving a\r\ngrown-up son and daughter, and his wife about to become a mother for the\r\nthird time.\r\n\r\n\"Pepina shall have her portion in money, since she is to marry soon,\"\r\nthe father said. \"Give her three hundred scudi in gold and a hundred in\r\npearls. The rest of the money shall be for my wife to do as she likes\r\nwith. For the little one; when it shall come, Matteo shall put in the\r\nbank every year thirty scudi, and when it shall be of age, be it girl or\r\nboy, he shall divide the land equally with it.\"\r\n\r\nSo said Giovanni Guai, and died, and his wife let him talk\r\nuncontradicted, since it was for the last time. They had lived a stormy\r\nlife, his heavy fist opposed to her indefatigable tongue, and she\r\ncontemplated with silent triumph the prospect of being left in\r\npossession of the field. Besides, would he not see afterward what she\r\ndid--see and be helpless to oppose? So she let him die fancying that he\r\nhad disposed of his property.\r\n\r\n\"The child is sure to be a girl,\" she said afterward, \"and I mean her to\r\nbe a nun. The land shall not be cut up. Matteo shall be a rich man and\r\npile up a fortune. He shall be the richest man in Monte Compatri, and a\r\ngirl shall not stand in his way.\"\r\n\r\nNature verified the mother's prophecy and sent a little girl. Silvia\r\nthey called her, and, since she was surely to be a nun, she grew to be\r\ncalled Sister Silvia by everybody, even before she was old enough to\r\nrecognize her own name.\r\n\r\nThe house of the Guai, on its inner wall, opened on the comparatively\r\nquiet Giro. From the windows and door could be heard the buzz and hum of\r\nthe Lungara, where everybody--men, women, children, cats and dogs--were\r\nout with every species of work and play when the sun began to decline.\r\nThis was the part of the house most frequented and liked by the family.\r\nThey could see their neighbors even when they were at work in their\r\nhouses, and could exchange gossip and stir the polenta at the same\r\ntime. The other side of the house they avoided. It was lonely and it was\r\nsunny. For Italians would have the sun, like the Lord, to be for ever\r\nknocking at the door and for ever shut out. It must shine upon their\r\nouter walls, but not by any means enter their windows.\r\n\r\nAs years passed, however, there grew to be one exception in this regard.\r\nSister Silvia loved not the town with its busy streets, nor the front\r\nwindows with their gossiping heads thrust out or in. She had her own\r\nchamber on the Campagna side, and there she sat the livelong day with\r\nknitting or sewing, never going out, except at early morning to hear\r\nmass. There her mother accompanied her--a large, self-satisfied woman\r\nbeside a pallid little maiden who never raised her eyes. Or, if her\r\nmother could not go, Matteo stalked along by her side, and with his\r\nblack looks made everybody afraid to glance her way. Nobody liked to\r\nencounter the two black eyes of Matteo Guai. It was understood that the\r\nknife in his belt was sharp, and that no scruple of conscience would\r\nstand between him and any vengeance he might choose to take for any\r\naffront he might choose to imagine.\r\n\r\nAfter mass, then, and the little work her mother permitted the girl to\r\ndo for health's sake, Silvia sat alone by her window and looked out on\r\nthe splendor which her eyes alone could appreciate. There lay the\r\nCampagna rolling and waving for miles and miles around, till the\r\nSabines, all rose and amethyst, hemmed it in with their exquisite wall,\r\nand the sea curved a gleaming sickle to cut off its flowery passage, or\r\nthe nearer mountains stood guard, almost covered by the green spray it\r\nthrew up their rocky sides. She sat and stared at Rome while her busy\r\nfingers knit--at the wonderful city where she was one day to go and be a\r\nnun, where the pope lived and kings came to worship him. In the morning\r\nlight the Holy City lay in the midst of the Campagna like her mother's\r\nwedding-pearls when dropped in a heap on their green cushion; and Silvia\r\nknelt with her face that way and prayed for a soul as white, for she\r\nwas to be the spouse of Christ, and her purity was all that she could\r\nbring Him as a dowry. But when evening came, and that other airy sea of\r\nfine golden mist flowed in from the west, and made a gorgeous blur of\r\nall things, then the city seemed to float upward from the earth and rise\r\ntoward heaven all stirring with the wings of its guardian angels, and\r\nSilvia would beg that the New Jerusalem might not be assumed till she\r\nshould have the happiness of being in it.\r\n\r\nBut there was a lovely view nearer than this visionary one, though the\r\nlittle nun seldom looked at it. If she should lean from her window she\r\nwould see the mountain-side dropping from the gray walls of her home,\r\nwith clinging flowery vines and trees growing downward, while the olives\r\nand grapevines of the Campagna came to meet them, setting here and there\r\na precarious little garden halfway up the steep. Just under her window\r\nan almost perpendicular path came up, crept round the walls and entered\r\nthe town. But no one ever used this road now, for a far wider and better\r\none had been constructed at the other side of the mountain, and all the\r\npeople came up that way when the day's work was over in the Campagna.\r\n\r\nOne summer afternoon Silvia's reveries were broken by her mother's voice\r\ncalling her: \"Silvia, come and prepare the salad for Matteo.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an extraordinary request, but the girl went at once without\r\nquestion. She seized upon every opportunity to practise obedience in\r\npreparation for that time when her life would be made up of obedience\r\nand prayer.\r\n\r\nHer mother was sitting by one of the windows talking with Matteo, who\r\nhad just came up from the Campagna. He had an unsocial habit of eating\r\nalone, and, as he ate nothing when down in the vineyard, always wanted\r\nhis supper as soon as he came up. The table was set for him with\r\nsnow-white cloth and napkin, silver knife, fork and spoon, a loaf of\r\nbread and a decanter of golden-sparkling wine icy cold from the grotto\r\nhewn in the rock beneath the house; and he was just eating his\r\n_minestra_ of vegetables when his sister came in. At the other end of\r\nthe long table was a head of crisp white lettuce lying on a clean linen\r\ntowel, and two bottles--one of white vinegar, the other of oil as sweet\r\nas cream and as bright as sunshine. Monte Compatri had no need to send\r\nto Lucca for oil of olives while its own orchards dropped such streams\r\nof pure richness.\r\n\r\nThe room was large and dingy. The brick floor had never known other\r\ncleansing than sprinkling and sweeping, the yellow-washed walls had\r\nbecome with time a pale, mottled brown, the paint had disappeared under\r\na fixed dinginess which the dusting-brush alone could not remove, and\r\nthe glass of the windows had never been washed except by the rain. Yet,\r\nfor all that, the place had an air of cleanliness. For though these\r\npeople do not clean their houses more than they clean their yards, yet\r\ntheir clothing and tables and beds are clean. Plentiful white linen,\r\nstockings like snow, and bright dishes and metals give a look of\r\nfreshness and show well on the dim background. Heavy walnut presses,\r\ncarved and black with age, stood against the walls, drinking-glasses and\r\ncandlesticks sparkled on a dark bureau-top, there was a bright picture\r\nor two, and the sunlighted tinware of a house at the other side of the\r\nstreet threw a cluster of tiny rays like a bouquet of light in at the\r\nwindow. Silvia received these sun-blossoms on her head when she placed\r\nherself at the lower end of the table. She pushed the sleeves of her\r\nwhite sack back from her slim white arms, and began washing the\r\nlettuce-leaves in a bowl of fresh water and breaking them in the towel.\r\nThe leaves broke with a fine snap and dropped in pieces as stiff as\r\npaper into a large dark-blue plate of old Japanese ware. A connoisseur\r\nin porcelain would have set such a plate on his drawing-room wall as a\r\npicture.\r\n\r\n\"How does Claudio work?\" the mother asked of her son.\r\n\r\n\"He works well,\" Matteo replied. \"He is worth two of our common fellows,\r\nif he _is_ educated.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, I should not have employed him,\" the mother said. \"He\r\nhas disobeyed and disappointed his parents, and he should be punished.\r\nThey meant him to be a priest, and raked and scraped every soldo to\r\neducate him. Now, just when he is at the point of being able to repay\r\nthem, he makes up his mind that he has no vocation for the priesthood,\r\nand breaks their hearts by his ingratitude. It is nonsense to set one's\r\nwill up so and have such scruples. Obedience is vocation enough for\r\nanything. There should be a prison where parents could put the children\r\nwho disobey them.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sora Guai spoke sternly, and looked as if she would not have\r\nhesitated to put a refractory child in the deepest of dungeons.\r\n\r\n\"He was a fool, but he earns his money,\" Matteo responded, and, drawing\r\na plate of deliciously fried frogs toward him, began to gnaw them and\r\nthrow the bones on the floor.\r\n\r\nSilvia gave him the salad, and poured wine and water into the tumbler\r\nfor him, while his mother went to the kitchen for a dish of fricasseed\r\npigeons.\r\n\r\n\"There's no onion in the salad,\" Matteo grumbled when she came back.\r\n\r\nSilvia uttered an exclamation of dismay, ran for a silvery-white little\r\nonion and sliced it thinly into the salad.\r\n\r\n\"Forgive me, Matteo,\" she said. \"I was distracted by the thought of\r\nClaudio. It seems such a terrible thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would be a much more terrible thing if it were a girl who\r\ndisobeyed,\" Matteo growled. He did not like that girls should criticise\r\nmen.\r\n\r\n\"So it would,\" the girl responded with meek readiness.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know why I feel so tired to-day,\" the mother said, sinking into\r\na chair again. \"My bones ache as if I had been working in the vineyard\r\nall day.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not ill, mamma?\" exclaimed Silvia, blushing with alarm.\r\n\r\nThe answer was a hesitating one: \"I don't see what can ail me. It\r\nwouldn't be anything, only that I am so tired without having done much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it's the weather, mamma,\" Silvia suggested.\r\n\r\nGentle as she was, she had adopted the ruthless and ungrateful Italian\r\ncustom of ascribing every ache and pain of the body to some almost\r\nimperceptible change in their too beautiful weather. The smallest cloud\r\ngoes laden with more accusations than it holds drops of rain, and the\r\nill winds that blow nobody any good blow through those shining skies\r\nfrom morning till night and from night till morning again.\r\n\r\nThe Sora Guai was sicker than she dreamed. It was not the summer sun\r\nthat scorched her so, nor the _scirocco_ that made her head so heavy.\r\nWhat malaria she had found to breathe on the mountain-top it would be\r\nhard to say; but the dreaded _perniciosa_ had caught her in its grasp,\r\nand she was doomed. The fever burned fiercely for a few days, and when\r\nit was quenched there was nothing left but ashes.\r\n\r\nAnd thus died the only earthly thing to which Sister Silvia's heart\r\nclung. The mother had been stern, but the daughter was too submissive to\r\nneed correction. She had never had any will of her own, except to love\r\nand obey. Collision between them was therefore impossible, and the\r\ndaughter felt as a frail plant growing under a shadowing tree might feel\r\nif the tree were cut down. She was bare to every wind that blew. She had\r\nno companions of her own age--she had no companion of any age, in\r\nfact--and she had not been accustomed to think for herself in the\r\nsmallest thing.\r\n\r\nShe had got bent into a certain shape, however, and her brother and\r\nsister felt quite safe on her account. Everybody knew that she was to be\r\na nun of the Perpetual Adoration; that she was soon to go to the convent\r\nof Santa Maria Maddalena on the Quirinal in Rome; and that, once entered\r\nthere, she would never again see a person from outside. The\r\ntown's-people were accustomed to the wall of silence and seclusion which\r\nhad already grown up about her, and they did not even seek to salute her\r\nwhen they met her going to and from church in the morning. To these\r\nsimple citizens, ignorant but reverential, Sister Silvia's lowered\r\neyelids were as inviolate as the pearl gates of the New Jerusalem.\r\nBesides, to help their reverence, there were the fierce black eyes and\r\nstrange reputation of Matteo. So when, a day or two after her mother's\r\ndeath, his sister begged him to accompany her to church in the early\r\nmorning, and leave her in the care of some decent woman there, Matteo\r\nreplied that she might go by herself.\r\n\r\nShe set out for the first time alone on what had ever been to her a _via\r\nsacra_, and was now become a _via dolorosa_, where her tears dropped as\r\nshe walked. And going so once, she went again. Pepina, the elder sister,\r\na widow now, had come home to keep house for Matteo, but she was too\r\nmuch taken up with work, the care of her two children and looking out\r\nfor a second husband to have time to watch Silvia, and after a few weeks\r\nthe young girl went as unheeded as a matron in her daily walk.\r\n\r\nAt home her life was nearly the same. She mended the clothes from the\r\nwashing and knit stockings, and sat at her window and looked off over\r\nthe Campagna toward Rome.\r\n\r\nOne evening she sat there before going to bed and watched the moonlight\r\nturn all the earth to black and silver under the purple sky--a black\r\nlike velvet, so deep and soft was it, and a silver like white fire,\r\nclear and splendid, yet beautifully soft. She was feeling desolate, and\r\nher tears dropped down, now and then breaking into sobs. It had been\r\npleasant to sit there alone when she knew that her mother was below\r\nstairs, strong, healthy and gay. All that life had been as the oil over\r\nwhich her little flame burned. Lacking it, she grew dim, just as the\r\nfloating wick in her little blue vase before the Madonna grew dim when\r\nthe oil was gone.\r\n\r\nAs she wept and heard unconsciously the nightingales, she grew conscious\r\nof another song that mingled with theirs. It was a human voice, clear\r\nand sweet as an angel's, and it sang a melody she knew in little\r\nsnatches that seemed to begin and end in a sigh. The voice came nearer\r\nand paused beneath a fig tree, and the words grew distinct.\r\n\r\n\"Pieta, signore, di me dolente,\" it sang.\r\n\r\nSilvia leaned out of the window and looked down at the singer. His face\r\nwas lifted to the white moonlight, and seemed in its pallid beauty a\r\nconcentration of the moonlight. Only his face was visible, for the\r\nshadow of the tree hid all his figure. One might almost have expected to\r\ncatch a glimmer of two motionless wings bearing up that face, so fair it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nTo Silvia it was as if another self, who grieved also, but who could\r\nspeak, were uttering all her pain, and lightening it so. She recognized\r\nClaudio's voice. He was the chief singer in the cathedral, and sang like\r\nan angel. She was afraid that Claudio had done very wrong in not being a\r\npriest, but, for all that, she had often found her devotion increased by\r\nhis singing. The Christmas night would not have been half so joyful\r\nlacking his _Adeste Fideles_; the _Stabat Mater_ sung by him in Holy\r\nWeek made her tears of religious sorrow burst forth afresh; and when on\r\nEaster morning he sang the _Gloria_ it had seemed to her that the\r\nheavens were opening.\r\n\r\nFor all that, however, he had been to her not a person, but a voice.\r\nThat he should come here and express her sorrow made him seem different.\r\nFor the first time she looked at his face. By daylight it was thin and\r\nfinely featured, and of a clear darkness like shaded water, through\r\nwhich the faintest tinge of color is visible. In this transfigurating\r\nmoonlight it became of a luminous whiteness.\r\n\r\nThe song ended, the singer turned his head slightly and looked up at\r\nSilvia's window. She did not draw back. There was no recognition of any\r\nhuman sympathy with him, and no slightest consciousness of that airy and\r\nsilent friendship which had long been weaving itself over the tops of\r\nthe mountains that separated them. How could she know that Claudio had\r\nsung for her, and that it had been the measure of his success to see her\r\nhead droop or lift as he sang of sorrow and pain or of joy and triumph?\r\nThe choir had their post over the door; and, besides, she never glanced\r\nup even in going out. Therefore she gazed down into his uplifted face\r\nwith a sweet and sorrowful tranquillity, her soul pure and candid to its\r\nuttermost depths.\r\n\r\nFor Claudio, who had sung to express his sympathy for her, but had not\r\ndreamed of seeing her, it was as if the dark-blue sky above had opened\r\nand an angel had looked out when he saw her face. He could only stretch\r\nhis clasped hands toward her.\r\n\r\nThe gesture made her weep anew, for it was like human kindness. She hid\r\nher face in her handkerchief, and he saw her wipe the tears away again\r\nand again.\r\n\r\nClaudio remembered a note he carried. It had been written the night\r\nbefore--not with any hope of her ever seeing it, but, as he had written\r\nher hundreds of notes before, pouring out his heart into them because it\r\nwas too full to bear without that relief. He took the note out, but how\r\nshould he give it to her? The window was too far above for him to toss\r\nso light a thing unless it should be weighted with a stone; and he could\r\nnot throw a stone at Silvia's window. He held it up, and, that she might\r\nsee it more clearly, tore up a handful of red poppies and laid it white\r\non the blossoms that were a deep red by night.\r\n\r\nSilvia understood, and after a moment's study dropped him down the ball\r\nof her knitting; and soon the note came swaying up through the still air\r\nresting on its cushion of poppies, for Claudio had wound the thread\r\nabout both flowers and letter.\r\n\r\nHe smiled with an almost incredulous delight as he saw the package\r\narrive safely at its destination and caught afterward the faint red\r\nlight of the lamp that Silvia had taken down from before her Madonna to\r\nread the note by. Since she was a little thing only five or six years\r\nold his heart had turned toward her, and her small white face had been\r\nto him the one star in a dim life. He still kept two or three tiny\r\nflowers she had given him years before when his family and hers were\r\ncoming together down from Monte San Silvestro at the other side of\r\nMonte Compatri. The two children, with others, had stopped to stick\r\nfresh flowers through the wire screen before the great crucifix halfway\r\nup the mountain, and Silvia had given Claudio these blossoms. He had\r\nlaid them away with his treasures and relics--the bit of muslin from the\r\nveil of Our Lady of Loretto, the almost invisible speck from the cord of\r\nSt. Francis of Assisi and the little paper of the ashes of Blessed\r\nJoseph Labre. In those days he was the little priest and she the little\r\nnun, and their companions stood respectfully back for them. Now he was\r\nno more the priest, and she was up there in her window against the sky\r\nreading the note he had written her.\r\n\r\nThis is what the note said:\r\n\r\n\"My heart is breaking for your sorrow. Why should such eyes as yours be\r\npermitted to weep? Who is there to wipe those tears away? Oh that I\r\nmight catch them as they fall! Drop me down a handkerchief that has been\r\nwet with them, that I may keep it as a relic. Tell me of some way in\r\nwhich I can console you and spend my life to serve you.\"\r\n\r\nShe read with a mingling of consolation and astonishment. Why, this was\r\nmore than her mother cared for her! But perhaps men were really more\r\nstrongly loving than women. It would seem so, since God, who knows all,\r\nwhen He wanted to express His love to mankind, took the form of a man,\r\nnot of a woman. Then she considered whether, and how, she should answer\r\nthis note, and the result of her considering was this, written hastily\r\non a bit of paper in which some Agnus Dei had been wrapped:\r\n\r\n     \"I do not know what I ought to write to you, but I thank you for\r\n     your kindness. It comforts me, and I have need of comfort. I think,\r\n     though, that it may be wrong for you to speak of my handkerchief as\r\n     if it were a relic. Relics are things which have belonged to the\r\n     saints, and I am not a saint at all, though I hope to become one. I\r\n     frequently do wrong. Spend your life in serving God, and pray for\r\n     me. You pray in singing, and your singing is very sweet.\r\n\r\n     SILVIA.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to her a simple and merely polite note. To him it was as the\r\nspark to a magazine of powder. All the possibilities of his life, only\r\nhalf hoped or half dreamed of, burst at once into a flame of certainty.\r\nShe had need of comfort, and he comforted her! His voice was sweet to\r\nher, and his singing was a prayer!\r\n\r\nSilvia should not be a nun. She should break the bond imposed by her\r\nmother, as he had broken that imposed by his parents. She should be his\r\nwife, and they would live in Rome. He knew that his voice would find\r\nbread for them.\r\n\r\nAll this flashed through his mind as he read, and pressed to his lips\r\nthe handkerchief which she had dropped down to him, though it was not a\r\nrelic. He lifted his arms upward toward her window with a rapturous joy,\r\nas if to embrace her, but she did not look out again. A little scruple\r\nfor having deprived the Madonna for a moment of her lamp had made her\r\nresolve to say at once a decade of the rosary in expiation. He waited\r\ntill the sound of closing doors and wandering voices told that the\r\ninhabitants gathered for the evening in the Lungara were separating to\r\ntheir homes, then went reluctantly away. Matteo would be at home, and\r\nMatteo's face might look down at him from that other window beside\r\nSilvia's. So he also went home, with the moonlight between his feet and\r\nthe ground and stars sparkling in his brain. He felt as if his head were\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nThis was an August night. One day in October, Matteo told his sister\r\nthat she was to go to Rome with him the next morning to pass a month\r\nwith a family they knew there, and afterward begin her noviciate in the\r\nconvent of the Sacramentarians at Monte Cavallo. He had received a\r\nletter from the Signora Fantini, who would receive her and do everything\r\nfor her. He and Pepina had no time, now that the vintage had begun, to\r\nattend to such affairs, even if they knew how.\r\n\r\nSilvia grew pale. She had not expected to go before the spring, and now\r\nall was arranged without a word being said to her, and she was to go\r\nwithout saying good-bye to any one.\r\n\r\nMatteo's sharp eyes were watching her. \"You will be ready to start at\r\nseven o'clock,\" he said: \"I must be back to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Matteo,\" she faltered, hesitated a moment, then ventured to add,\r\n\"I did not expect to go so soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what of that?\" he demanded roughly. \"You were to go at the proper\r\ntime, and the proper time is to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nShe trembled, but ventured another word: \"I should like to see my\r\nconfessor first.\"\r\n\r\n\"He will come here this evening to see you,\" her brother replied: \"I\r\nhave already talked with him. You have nothing else to do. Pepina will\r\npack your trunk while you are talking with the priest.\"\r\n\r\nSilvia had no more to say. She was bound hand and foot. Besides, she was\r\nwilling to go, she assured herself. It was her duty to obey her parents,\r\nor the ones who stood in their place and had authority over her. Matteo\r\nsaid she must go; therefore it was her duty to go, and she was willing.\r\n\r\nBut the willing girl looked very pale and walked about with a very\r\nfeeble step, and it was hard work to keep the tears that were every\r\nmoment rising to her eyes from falling over her cheeks. It was such a\r\npitiful face, indeed, that Father Teodoli, when he came just before Ave\r\nMaria, asked if Silvia were ill.\r\n\r\n\"She has had a toothache,\" Matteo said quickly, and gave his sister a\r\nglance.\r\n\r\n\"And what have you done for it, my child?\" the priest asked kindly.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" Silvia faltered out.\r\n\r\n\"I will leave you to give Silvia all the advice she needs,\" Matteo said\r\nafter the compliments of welcome were over. \"I have to go down the\r\nLungara for men to work in the vineyard to-morrow.--Silvia, come and\r\nshut the door after me: there is too much draught here.\"\r\n\r\nSilvia followed her brother to the door, trembling for what he might say\r\nor do. Well she knew that his command was given only that he might have\r\na chance to speak with her alone.\r\n\r\n\"Mind what you say to your confessor,\" he whispered, grasping her arm\r\nand speaking in her ear. \"You are to be a nun: you wish to be, and you\r\nare willing to set out to-morrow. Tell him no nonsense--do you hear?--or\r\nit will be worse for you. I shall know every word you say. If he asks if\r\nyou had a toothache say Yes. Do you hear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Matteo.\"\r\n\r\nShe went back half fainting, and did as she had been commanded. If there\r\nhad been any little lurking impulse to beg for another week or month, it\r\ndied of fear. If she had any confession to make of other wishes than\r\nthose chosen for her, she postponed it. Matteo might be behind the door\r\nlistening, or in the next room or at the window. It seemed to her that\r\nhe could make himself invisible in order to keep guard over her.\r\n\r\nSo the priest talked a little, learned nothing, gave some advice,\r\nrecommended himself to her prayers, gave her his benediction, and went.\r\nThen Pepina called her to see the trunk all packed with linen that had\r\nbeen laid by for her for years, and Matteo, who had really been lurking\r\nabout the house, told her to go to bed, and himself really went off this\r\ntime to the Lungara. Pepina's lover came for her to sit out on the\r\ndoorstep with him, and Silvia was left alone. Nobody cared for her. All\r\nhad other interests, and they forgot her the moment she was out of their\r\nsight. Worse, even: they wanted her to be for ever out of their sight,\r\nthat they might never have to think of her.\r\n\r\nBut no: there was one who did not forget her--who would perhaps now have\r\nheard that she was going away, and be waiting in the mountain-path for\r\nher. She hastened to her room, locked the door and went to the window.\r\nHe made a gesture of haste, and she dropped the ball down to him. This\r\nwas not the second time that their conversation had been held by means\r\nof a thread. Indeed, they had come to talk so every night. At first it\r\nhad been a few words only, and Silvia's unconsciousness and her\r\nsincerity in her intention to follow her mother's will had imposed\r\nsilence on the young man. But little by little he had ventured, and she\r\nhad understood; and within the last week there had been no concealments\r\nbetween them, though Silvia still resisted all his prayers to change her\r\nresolution and brave her brother.\r\n\r\nHis first note was in her hands in a moment:\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible that what I hear is true? I will not believe it: I will\r\nnot let you go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and I must go,\" she wrote back. \"I have to start at seven in the\r\nmorning. Dear Claudio, be resigned: there is no help for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Silvia, why will you persist in ruining your life and mine? It is a\r\nsin. Say that you are too sick to go to-morrow. Stay in bed all day, and\r\nby night I will have a rope-ladder for you to come down to me. We can\r\nrun away and hide somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot. We could never hide from Matteo: he would find us out and\r\nkill us both.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will go to the Holy Father and tell him all. We could be in Rome\r\nearly in the morning if we should walk all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Matteo would hear us: he hears everything. We should never reach Rome.\r\nHe would find us wherever we might be hidden. If we were dead and buried\r\nhe would pull us out of the ground to stab us. I must go. I have sinned\r\nin having so much intercourse with you. Be resigned, Claudio. Be a good\r\nman, and we shall meet in heaven. The earth is a terrible place: I am\r\nafraid of it. I want to shut myself up in the convent and be at peace. I\r\nfear so much that I tremble all the time. Say addio.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot. Will you stay in bed to-morrow, and let me try if I cannot go\r\nto Rome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Say addio, Claudio. I dare not stay here any longer: I hear some one\r\noutside my door. I say addio to you now. I shall not drop the ball\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not even draw it up again, for the thread caught on a nail in\r\nthe wall and broke. And at the same time there was a knock at her door.\r\n\r\n\"Silvia, why do you not go to bed?\" Matteo called out: \"I hear you up.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going now,\" she made haste to answer, and in her terror threw\r\nherself on the bed without undressing. She wondered if Matteo could hear\r\nher heart beat through the wall or see how she was shaking.\r\n\r\nThe next morning at seven o'clock Silvia and her brother took their\r\nseats in the clumsy coach that goes from Monte Compatri to Rome whenever\r\nthere are passengers enough to fill it, and after confused leavetakings\r\nfrom all but the one she wished most to see they set out. Claudio was\r\ninvisible. In fact, he had lain on the ground all night beneath her\r\nwindow, and now, hidden in a tree, was watching the winding road for an\r\noccasional glimpse of the carriage as it bore his love away.\r\n\r\nThe peasants of Italy, when they see the Milky Way stretching its\r\nwavering, cloudy path across the sky, shining as if made up of the\r\nfootprints of innumerable saints, say that it is the road to Jerusalem.\r\nThe road to the New Jerusalem has no such pallid and spiritual glory:\r\nits colors are those of life. No death but that of martyrdom, with its\r\nrosy blood, waving palm-branch and golden crown, is figured there. Life,\r\nand the joy of life, beauty so profuse that it can afford to have a few\r\nblemishes like a slatternly Venus, and the _dolce far niente_ of poverty\r\nthat neither works nor starves,--they lie all along the road.\r\n\r\nSilvia was young, and had all her life looked forward to this journey.\r\nShe could not be quite indifferent. She looked and listened, though all\r\nthe time her heart was heavy for Claudio. They reached the gate of St.\r\nJohn Lateran just as all the bells began to ring for the noon _Angelus_,\r\nand in fifteen minutes were at the Signora Fantini's door and Silvia in\r\nthe kind lady's arms. It seemed to the girl that she had found her\r\nmother again. That this lady was more gracious, graceful, kind and\r\nbeautiful than her mother had ever been she would not think. She was\r\nsimply another mother. And when Matteo had gone away home again, not\r\ntoo soon, and when, after a few days' sightseeing, the signora,\r\nsuspecting that the continued sadness of her young guest had some other\r\ncause than separation from her brother and sister, sought persistently\r\nand artfully to win her secret, Silvia told her all with many tears. She\r\nwas going to be a nun because her mother had said that she must; and she\r\nwas willing to be a nun--certainly she was willing. But, for all that,\r\nif it could have been so, she would have been so happy with Claudio, and\r\nshe never should be quite happy without him.\r\n\r\n\"Then you must not be a nun,\" the signora said decidedly. \"The thing is\r\nall wrong. You have no vocation. You should have said all this before.\"\r\n\r\nFor already the signora had taken Silvia to see the Superior at Monte\r\nCavallo, who had promised to receive the young novice in three weeks,\r\nand had told her what work she could perform in the convent. \"You are\r\nnot strong, I think,\" she had said, \"but you can knit the stockings. All\r\nhave to work.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Monsignor Catinari, whose business it was to examine all candidates\r\nfor the conventual life, had held a long conversation with her and gone\r\naway perfectly satisfied.\r\n\r\nBut when the signora proposed to undo all this, Silvia was wild with\r\nterror. No, no, she would be a nun. Her mother had said so, she wished\r\nit, and Matteo would kill her if she should refuse.\r\n\r\n\"Leave it all to me,\" the signora said, and laid her motherly hand on\r\nthe trembling little ones held out to her in entreaty. \"We will look out\r\nfor that. Matteo shall not hurt you or Claudio. I am going to send for\r\nMonsignor Catinari again, and you must tell him the truth this time. And\r\nthen we will see what can be done in the case. Don't look so terrified,\r\nchild. Do you think that Matteo rules the world?\"\r\n\r\nPoor little Silvia could not be reassured, for to her other terrors was\r\nnow added Monsignor Catinari's possible wrath. To her, men were objects\r\nof terror. The doctrine of masculine supremacy, so pitilessly upheld in\r\nItaly, was exaggerated to her mind by her brother's character; and\r\nthough she believed that help was sometimes possible, she also believed\r\nthat it often came too late, as in the case of poor Beatrice Cenci. They\r\nmight stand between her and Matteo, but if he had first killed her, what\r\ngood would it do? She had a fixed idea that he would kill her.\r\n\r\nMonsignor Catinari was indeed much provoked when the signora told him\r\nthe true story of the little novice.\r\n\r\n\"Just see what creatures girls are!\" he exclaimed. \"How are we to know\r\nif they have a vocation or not? That girl professed herself both willing\r\nand desirous to be a nun.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not scold Silvia, however. When he saw her pretty frightened face\r\nhis heart relented. \"You have told me a good many lies, my child,\" he\r\nsaid, \"but I forgive you, since they were not intended in malice. We\r\nwill say no more about it. I learn from the signora that this Claudio is\r\na good young man, so the sooner you are married the better. Cheer up: we\r\nwill have you a bride by the first week of November; and if Claudio has\r\nsuch a wonderful voice, he can make his way in Rome.\"\r\n\r\nThe reassurances of a man were more effectual than those of a woman.\r\n\r\n\"At last I believe! at last I fear no more!\" Silvia cried, throwing\r\nherself into the arms of the Signora Fantini when the Monsignor was\r\ngone. \"Oh how beautiful the earth is! how beautiful life is!\"\r\n\r\n\"We will then begin immediately to enjoy life,\" the signora replied.\r\n\"Collation is ready, and Nanna has bought us some of the most delicious\r\ngrapes. See how large and rich they are! One could almost slice them.\r\nThere! these black figs are like honey. Try one now, before your soup.\r\nThe macaroni that will be brought in presently was made in the\r\nhouse--none of your Naples stuff, made nobody knows how or by whom. What\r\nelse Nanna has for us I cannot say. She was very secret this morning,\r\nand I suspect that means riceballs seasoned with mushrooms and hashed\r\ngiblets of turkey. She always becomes mysterious when those are in\r\npreparation. Eat well, child, and get a little flesh and color before\r\nClaudio comes.\"\r\n\r\nThey made a merry breakfast, with the noon sun sending its golden arrows\r\nthrough every tiniest chink of the closed shutters and an almost summer\r\nheat reigning without. Then there was an hour of sleep, then a drive to\r\nthe Pincio to see all the notable people who came up there to look at or\r\nspeak to each other while the sun sank behind St. Peter's. And in the\r\nevening after dinner they went to the housetop to see the fireworks\r\nwhich were being displayed for some festa or other; and later there was\r\nmusic, and then to bed.\r\n\r\nLife became an enchantment to the little bride-elect, as life in Italy\r\nwill become to any one who has not too heavy a cross to bear. For peace\r\nin this beautiful land means delight, not merely the absence of pain.\r\nHow the sun shone! and how the fountains danced! What roses bloomed\r\neverywhere! what fruits of Eden were everywhere piled! How soft the\r\nspeech was! and how sweet the smiles! And when it was discovered that\r\nSilvia had a beautiful voice, so that she and Claudio would be like a\r\npair of birds together, then it seemed to her that a nest of twigs on a\r\ntree-branch would be all that she could desire.\r\n\r\nThey took her to see the pope on one of those days. It was as if they\r\nhad taken her to heaven. To her he was the soul of Rome, the reason why\r\nRome was; and when she saw his white figure against the scarlet\r\nbackground of cardinals she remembered how Rome looked against the rosy\r\nCampagna at sunset from her far-away window in Monte Compatri.\r\n\r\n\"A little _sposa_, is she?\" the pope said when Monsignor Catinari\r\npresented her.--\"I bless you, my child: wear this in memory of me.\" He\r\ngave her a little gold medal from a tiny pocket at his side, laid his\r\nhand on her head and passed on. It was too much: she had to weep for\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nThen, when the audience was over, they took her through the museum and\r\nlibrary, and some one gave her a bunch of roses out of the pope's\r\nprivate garden, and she was put into a carriage and driven home, her\r\nheart beating somewhere in her head, her feet winged and her eyes\r\ndazzled.\r\n\r\nThere was a rapturous letter from Claudio awaiting her, and by that she\r\nknew that it was not all a dream. She rattled the paper in her hands as\r\nshe sat with her eyes shut, half dreaming, to make sure and keep sure\r\nthat she was not to wake up presently to bitterness. Claudio would come\r\nto Rome in a week, and perhaps they would be married before he should go\r\nback. There was no letter from Matteo. So much the better.\r\n\r\nOne golden day succeeded another, and Silvia changed from a lily to a\r\nrose with marvellous rapidity. She was not a ruddy, full-leaved rose,\r\nthough, but like one of those delicate ones with clouds of red on them\r\nand petals that only touch the calyx, as if they were wings and must be\r\nfree to move. She was slim and frail, and her color wavered, and her\r\nhead had a little droop, and her voice was low. She had always been the\r\nstillest creature alive; and now, full of happiness as she was, her\r\nfeelings showed themselves in an uneasy stirring, like that of a flower\r\nin which a bee has hidden itself. After the first outburst she did not\r\nso much say that she was happy as breathe and look it.\r\n\r\nOne noonday, when life seemed too beautiful to last, and they all sat\r\ntogether after breakfast, the signora, her daughter and Silvia, too\r\ncontented to say a word, the door opened, and Matteo Guai came in with a\r\nblack, smileless face, and not the slightest salutation for his sister.\r\nHe had come to take Silvia home, he replied briefly to the signora's\r\ncompliments. She must be ready in an hour. The vintage was suffering by\r\nhis absence, and it was necessary that he should return at once.\r\n\r\nSignora Fantini poured out the most voluble exclamations, prayers and\r\nprotests. She had forty engagements for Silvia. They had had only a few\r\ndays' visit from her, and she was to have stayed a month. They would\r\nthemselves accompany her to Monte Compatri later if it was necessary\r\nthat she should go. But, in fine, Monsignor Catinari did not expect her\r\nto return.\r\n\r\n\"I am the head of the family, and my sister has to obey me till she is\r\nmarried,\" Matteo replied doggedly. \"I suppose that Monsignor Catinari\r\nwill not deny that. The Church always supports the authority of the\r\nmaster of the family.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, of course,\" the signora replied, rather confused by this\r\nirresistible argument, \"you have the right, and no one will resist you.\r\nBut as a favor now--\" and the signora assumed her most coaxing smile,\r\nand even advanced a plump white hand to touch Matteo's sleeve.\r\n\r\nShe might as well have tried to bewitch and persuade the bronze Augustus\r\non the Capitoline Hill.\r\n\r\n\"Things are changed since it was promised that Silvia should stay a\r\nmonth with you,\" Matteo replied. \"There is work at home for her to do.\r\nSince she is not to be a nun, she must work. Let her be ready to start\r\nin an hour: my carriage is waiting at the door. I am going out into the\r\npiazza for a little while. I will send a man up for her trunk when I am\r\nready to start.\"\r\n\r\nSilvia uttered not a word. At sight of her brother she had sunk back in\r\nher chair white and speechless. On hearing his voice she had closed her\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nHe half turned to her before going out, looking at her out of the\r\ncorners of his evil eyes, a cold, strange smile wreathing his lips. \"So\r\nyou are not going to be a nun?\" he said.\r\n\r\nShe did not respond. Only the quiver of her lowered eyelids and a slight\r\nshiver told that she knew he was addressing her.\r\n\r\nMatteo went out, and the signora, at her wits' end, undertook to\r\nencourage Silvia. There was no time to see Monsignor Catinari or to\r\nappeal to any authority; and if there were, it would have availed\r\nnothing perhaps. Almost any one would have said that the girl's terrors\r\nwere fanciful, and that it was quite natural her brother, who would lose\r\nfive hundred scudi by her change of purpose, should require her to work\r\nas other girls of her condition worked.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up and go with him, _figlia mia_,\" she said, \"and leave all to\r\nme. I will see Monsignor Catinari this very evening, and post a letter\r\nto you before I go to bed. If Matteo is unkind to you, we will have you\r\ntaken away from him at once. And, in any case, you shall be married in a\r\nfew weeks at the most, as Monsignor promised. Don't cry so: don't say\r\nthat you cannot go. I am sorry and vexed, my dear, but I see no way but\r\nfor you to go. Depend upon me. No harm shall come to you. I will myself\r\ncome to Monte Compatri within the week, and arrange all for you.\r\nBesides, recollect that you will see Claudio: he is there waiting for\r\nyou. Perhaps you may see him this very evening.\"\r\n\r\nThe Signora Fantini's efforts to cheer and reassure the sister were as\r\nineffectual as her efforts to persuade the brother had been. Silvia\r\nsubmitted because she had no strength to resist.\r\n\r\n\"O Madonna mia!\" she kept murmuring, \"he will kill me! he will kill me!\r\nO Madonna mia! pray for me.\"\r\n\r\nWhen an Italian says that he will come back in an hour, you may look for\r\nhim after two hours. Matteo was no exception to the rule. It was already\r\nmid-afternoon when the porter came up and said that Silvia's brother was\r\nwaiting for her below.\r\n\r\nThe signora gave her a tumbler half full of _vin santo_, which she kept\r\nfor special occasions--a strong, delicious wine with the perfume of a\r\nwhole garden in it. \"Drink every drop,\" she commanded: \"it will give you\r\ncourage. You had better be a little tipsy than fainting away. And put\r\nthis bottle into your pocket to drink when you have need on the way.\"\r\n\r\nMore dead than alive, Silvia was placed in the little old-fashioned\r\ncarriage that Matteo had hired to come to Rome in, and her brother took\r\nhis seat beside her. The Signora Fantini and her daughter leaned from\r\nthe window, kissing their hands to her and shaking their handkerchiefs\r\nas long as she was in sight. And as long as she was in sight they saw\r\nher pale face turned backward, looking at them. Then the tawny stone of\r\na church-corner hid her from their eyes for ever.\r\n\r\nWho knows or can guess what that drive was? The two passed through\r\nFrascati, and Matteo stopped to speak to an acquaintance there. They\r\ndrove around Monte Porzio, and Matteo stopped again, to buy a glass of\r\nwine and some figs. He offered some to his sister, but she shook her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"She is sleepy,\" her brother said to the man of whom he had bought.\r\n\"Give me another tumbler of wine: it isn't bad.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the last barrel I have of the vintage of two years ago,\" the man\r\nreplied. \"It was a good vintage. If the signorina would take a drop she\r\nwould sleep the better. Besides, the night is coming on and there is a\r\nchill in the air.\"\r\n\r\nSilvia opened her eyes and made the little horizontal motion with her\r\nfore finger which in Italy means no.\r\n\r\n\"She will sleep well enough,\" Matteo said, and drove on.\r\n\r\nNight was coming on, and they had no more towns to pass--only a bit more\r\nof lonely level road and the lonely road that wound to and fro up the\r\nmountain-side. At the best, they could not reach home before ten\r\no'clock. The road went to and fro--sometimes open, to give a view of the\r\nCampagna and the Sabine Mountains, and Soracte swimming in a lustrous\r\ndimness on the horizon; sometimes shut in closely by trees, that made it\r\nalmost black in spite of the moon. For the moon was low and gave but\r\nlittle light, being but a crescent as yet. There was a shooting star now\r\nand then, breaking out like a rocket with a trail of sparks or slipping\r\nsmall and pallid across the sky.\r\n\r\nOne of these latter might have been poor Silvia's soul slipping away\r\nfrom the earth. It went out there somewhere on the mountain-side. Matteo\r\nsaid the carriage tilted, and she, being asleep, fell out before he\r\ncould prevent. Her temple struck a sharp rock, and Claudio missed his\r\nbride.\r\n\r\nHe had to keep quiet about it, though. What could he prove? what could\r\nany one prove? Where knives are sharp and people mind their own\r\nbusiness, or express their opinions only by a shrug of the shoulders and\r\na grimace, how is a poor boy, how is even a rich man or a rich woman, to\r\ncome at the truth in such a case? Besides, the truth would not have\r\nbrought her back, poor little Silvia!\r\n\r\n  MARY AGNES TINCKER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SPANISH STORY-TELLER\r\n\r\n\r\nIn these days of pessimism in literature, when Tourgueneff and\r\nSacher-Masoch represent man as the victim of blind Chance and\r\nannihilation his greatest happiness, it is pleasant to turn to a writer\r\nwho still believes in God, his country and the family, and recognizes an\r\noverruling Providence that directs the world. It is not strange that\r\nthese old-fashioned ideas should be found in Spain, where, in spite of\r\nmuch ignorance and superstition, the lower classes are deeply religious\r\nin the best sense of the word, and distinguished for their patriotism\r\nand intense love for their homes.\r\n\r\nAntonio de Trueba, the subject of this sketch, was born in 1821 at\r\nMontellano, a little village in Biscay. He thus describes the home of\r\nhis childhood in the preface to his collected poems: \"On the brow of one\r\nof the mountains that surround a valley of Biscay there are four little\r\nhouses, white as four doves, hidden in a grove of chestnut and walnut\r\ntrees--four houses that can only be seen at a distance when the autumn\r\nhas removed the leaves from the trees. There I spent the first fifteen\r\nyears of my life. In the bottom of the valley there is a church whose\r\nbelfry pierces the arch of foliage and rises majestic above the ash and\r\nwalnut trees, as if to signify that the voice of God rises above\r\nNature; and in that church two masses were said on Sunday--one at\r\nsunrise and the other two hours later. We children rose with the song of\r\nthe birds and went down to the first mass, singing and leaping through\r\nthe shady oak-groves, while our elders came down later to high mass.\r\nWhile our parents and grand-parents were attending it I sat down beneath\r\nsome cherry trees that were opposite my father's house--for from that\r\nspot could be seen the whole valley that ended in the sea--and shortly\r\nafter four or five young girls came to seek me, red as the cherries that\r\nhung over my head or as the graceful knots of ribbon that tied the long\r\nbraids of their hair, and made me compose couplets for them to sing to\r\ntheir sweethearts in the afternoon, to the sound of the tambourine,\r\nunder the walnut trees where the young people danced and the elders\r\nchatted and enjoyed our pleasure.\"\r\n\r\nThe young poet's parents were simple tillers of the soil, who gave their\r\nson a meagre education. In one of his letters he says that his father's\r\nlibrary consisted of the _Fueros de Viscaya_ (the old laws of Biscay),\r\nthe _Fables_ of Samaniego, _Don Quixote_, some ballads brought from\r\nValmaseda or Bilbao, and two or three lives of the saints. Antonio seems\r\nto have had from his earliest childhood an ardent love of poetry, and in\r\nthe passage quoted above he mentions his own compositions. He continues\r\nby saying, \"I remember one day one of those girls was very sad because\r\nher sweetheart was going away for a long time. She wanted a song to\r\nexpress her grief, and I composed one at her request. A few days later\r\nshe did not need my aid to sing her sorrow: in proportion as it had\r\nincreased her ability to sing it herself had also increased, for poetry\r\nis the child of feeling. Her songs, as well as those I composed, soon\r\nbecame popular in the valley.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the poet was fifteen years old the civil war waged by Don Carlos\r\nwas desolating Spain. The inhabitants of Biscay espoused his cause, but\r\nAntonio's parents were unwilling to expose their son to the dangers he\r\nmust run if he remained at home, and therefore decided to send him to a\r\ndistant relative in Madrid who kept a hardware-shop. \"One night in\r\nNovember,\" says Trueba, \"I departed from my village, perhaps--my\r\nGod!--never to return. I descended the valley with my eyes bathed in\r\ntears. The cocks began to crow, the dogs barked, the owls hooted in the\r\nmountains, the wind moaned in the tops of the walnut trees, and the\r\nriver roared furiously rushing down the valley; but the inhabitants of\r\nthe village slept peaceably, except my parents and brothers, who from\r\nthe window followed weeping the sound of my footsteps, about to be lost\r\nin the noise of the valley. I was just leaving the last house of the\r\nvillage when one of those girls who had so often sought me under the\r\ncherry trees approached the window and took leave of me sobbing. On\r\ncrossing a hill, about to lose the valley from my sight, I heard a\r\ndistant song, and stopped. That same girl was sending me her last\r\nfarewell in a song as beautiful as the sentiment that inspired it.\"\r\n\r\nAntonio devoted himself to his duties during the day and pursued his\r\nstudies with eagerness during the night. What he suffered from\r\nhome-sickness the reader can easily imagine. All through his later works\r\nare scattered reminiscences of those unhappy years in Madrid, when his\r\nmemory fondly turned to the mountains and cherry-groves of his beloved\r\nEncartaciones.[1] Often dreaming of the country, which, he says, is his\r\nperpetual dream, he imagined the moment in which God would permit him to\r\nreturn to the valley in which he was born. \"When this happens, I say to\r\nmyself, my brow will be wrinkled and my hair gray. The day on which I\r\nreturn to my native valley will be a festal day, and on crossing the\r\nhill from which I can behold the whole valley, I shall hear the bells\r\nringing for high mass. How sweetly will resound in my ears those bells\r\nthat so often rilled my childhood with delight! I shall enter the\r\nvalley, my heart beating, my breathing difficult and my eyes bathed with\r\ntears of joy. There will be, with its white and sonorous belfry, the\r\nchurch where the holy water of baptism was poured upon the brows of my\r\nparents and my own; there will be the walnut and chestnut trees beneath\r\nwhose shade we danced on Sunday afternoons; there will be the wood where\r\nmy brothers and I looked for birds' nests and made whistles out of the\r\nchestnut and walnut bark; there, along the road, will be the apple trees\r\nwhose fruit my companions and I knocked off with stones when we went to\r\nschool; there will be the little white house where my grand-parents, my\r\nfather, my brothers and I were born; there will be all that does not\r\nfeel or breathe. But where will be, my God, all those who with tears in\r\ntheir eyes bade me farewell so many years ago? I shall follow the valley\r\ndown: I shall recognize the valley, but not its inhabitants. Judge\r\nwhether there will be among sorrows a greater sorrow than mine! The\r\npeople gathered in the portico of the church waiting for mass to begin\r\nwill look over the wall along the road, and others will look out of the\r\nwindows, all to see the stranger pass. And they will not know me, and I\r\nshall not know them, for those children and those youths and those old\r\nmen will not be the old men nor the youths nor the children whom I left\r\nin my native valley. I shall follow sadly the valley down. 'All that has\r\nfelt,' I shall exclaim, 'has changed or died. What is it that preserves\r\nhere pure and immaculate the sentiments which I inspired?' And then some\r\nvillage-woman will sing one of those songs in which I enclosed the\r\ndeepest feelings of my soul, and on hearing her my heart will want to\r\nleap from my breast, and I shall fall on my knees, and, if emotion and\r\nsobs do not stifle my voice, I shall exclaim, 'Holy and thrice holy,\r\nblessed and thrice blessed, poetry which immortalizes human sentiment!'\"\r\n\r\nAntonio after a time left his relative's shop to enter another in the\r\nsame business, from which he was relieved by the owner's financial\r\ndifficulties. He then determined to devote himself to literature, and\r\nbecame a writer for the papers. In 1852 he published _Libro de Cantares_\r\n(_Book of Songs_), which at once made his name a household word\r\nthroughout Spain. He tells us that most of the poems in it were composed\r\nmentally while dreaming of his native country and wandering about the\r\nenvirons of Madrid, \"wherever the birds sing and the people display\r\ntheir virtues and their vices, for the noble Spanish people have a\r\nlittle of everything.\" He warns his readers not to expect from him what\r\nhe cannot give them: \"Do not seek in this book erudition or culture or\r\nart. Seek recollections and feeling, and nothing more. Fifteen years ago\r\nI left my solitary village: these fifteen years, instead of singing\r\nunder the cherry trees of my native country, I sing in the midst of the\r\nBabylon which rises on the banks of the Manzanares; and,\r\nnotwithstanding, I still amuse myself with counting from here the trees\r\nthat shade the little white house where I was born, and where, God\r\nwilling, I shall die: my songs still resemble those of fifteen years\r\nago. What do I understand of Greek or Latin, of the precepts of Horace\r\nor of Aristotle? Speak to me of the blue skies and seas, of birds and\r\nboughs, of harvests and trees laden with golden fruit, of the loves and\r\njoys and griefs of the upright and simple villagers, and then I shall\r\nunderstand you, because I understand nothing more than this.\"\r\n\r\nThese poems are what the author calls them, nothing more--pure and\r\nsimple records of the life of the people around him, their loves and\r\ngriefs, their hopes and disappointments. The most usual metre is the\r\nsimple Spanish _asonante_, or eight-syllable trochaic verse, with the\r\nvowel rhyme called _asonante_.[2] They are pervaded by a tender spirit\r\nof melancholy, very different from the _Weltschmerz_ of Heine, with some\r\nof whose lyrics the Spanish poet's _cantares_ may be compared without\r\nlosing anything by the comparison. In one poem he says: \"In the depths\r\nof my heart are great sorrows: some of them are known to men, others to\r\nGod alone. But I shall rarely mention my griefs in my songs, for I have\r\nno hope that they can be alleviated; and where is the mortal who, in\r\npassing through this valley, has not encountered among the flowers some\r\nsharp thorn?\" In the same poem he says: \"All ask me, Who taught you to\r\nsing? No one: I sing because God wills it--I sing like the birds;\" and\r\nhe explains his method by a touching incident. One evening he was\r\nsinging on the bank of the Manzanares when he saw a child smiling on the\r\nbreast of its mother. The poet went and caressed it, and the child threw\r\nits arms about Antonio's neck and turning to its mother cried, \"Mother,\r\nAntonio, he of the songs, is a blind man who sees.\"[3] The poet\r\ncontinues: \"I am a blind man who sees: that angel told the truth. With\r\nmy guitar resting on my loving heart, you may see me wandering from the\r\ncity to the valley, from the cabin of the poor to the palace of the\r\ngreat, weeping with those who weep, singing with those who sing, for my\r\nrude guitar is the lasting echo of all joys and all sorrows. I shall\r\nsing my songs in the simple language of the laborer and the soldier, of\r\nthe children and the mothers, of those who have not frequented learned\r\nschools.... In this language I shall extol the faith and the holy\r\ncombats of the soldiers of Christ with the sacrilegious Saracen; I shall\r\nsing the heroic efforts of our fathers to conquer the proud legions of\r\nBonaparte; and the beauty of the skies, and the flowers of the valley,\r\nand love and innocence--all that is beautiful and great--will find a\r\nlasting echo in my rude guitar.\"\r\n\r\nMany of these songs are ingenious variations on a theme supplied by some\r\nold and well-known poem, a few lines of which are woven into each\r\ndivision of the new song.\r\n\r\nThe success of the _Libro de los Cantares_ was immediate and great; the\r\nfirst three editions were exhausted in a few months; the duc de\r\nMontpensier wished to defray the expenses of the fourth, and Queen\r\nIsabella of the fifth; since then others have followed. Some years later\r\nthe poet married, and since then has written chiefly in prose.\r\n\r\nIn 1859 appeared a volume of short tales entitled _Rose-colored Stories_\r\n(_Cuentos de Color de Rosa_): these were followed by _Tales of the\r\nCountry_ (_Cuentos campesinos_), _Popular Tales_ (_Cuentos popolares_),\r\n_Popular Narrations_ (_Narraciones popolares_), _Tales of Various\r\nColors_, _Tales of the Dead and Living_, etc.[4]\r\n\r\nBefore examining in detail any of these collections it may be well to\r\nlearn the author's views of his task and definition of his subject. In\r\nthe introduction to the _Popular Tales_ he says, addressing his friend\r\nDon Jose de Castro y Serrano: \"The object of this preface is simply to\r\ntell you why I have given the name of _Popular Tales_ to those contained\r\nin this volume, what I understand by popular literature, and why I write\r\ntales instead of writing novels or comedies or cookbooks. There are two\r\nreasons why I have called these tales popular. First, because many of\r\nthem are told by the people; and, secondly, because in retelling them I\r\nhave used the simple and plain style of the people.... In my conception,\r\npopular literature can be defined in this manner: That literature which\r\nby its simplicity and clearness is within the reach of the intelligence\r\nof the people.... However, in popular literature the simplicity of form\r\nis not enough: it is necessary to reproduce Nature, because if not\r\nreproduced there will be no truth in it; and if there is no truth in it\r\nthe people will not believe it; and if they do not believe it they will\r\nnot feel it. For my part, I take such pains in studying Nature, in order\r\nthat my pictures may be true, that I fear you will accuse me of\r\nextravagance, and will laugh at me when you read the two examples I am\r\ngoing to cite. On a very severe night in January I was writing in the\r\nfourth story of the street Lope de Vega, No. 32, the tale which I named\r\n_De Patas en el Infierno_ ('The Feet in Hell'), and when a detail\r\noccurred which consisted in explaining the changes in the sound made by\r\nwater in filling a jar at a fountain, I found that I had never studied\r\nthese changes, and I did not have in the house at that moment water\r\nenough to study them. The printers were going to send for the story\r\nearly in the morning, and it must be finished that night. Do you know\r\nwhat I did to get out of my difficulty? At three o'clock in the morning,\r\nfacing the darkness, rain and wind, I went to the little fountain near\r\nby with a jar under my cloak, and spent a quarter of an hour there\r\nlistening to the sound of the water as it fell into the jar. A short\r\ntime after I was preparing to write the rural tale called _Las Siembras\r\ny las Cosechas_ ('Seed-time and Harvest'), and the description of a\r\nsunrise in the country entered into my plan. I had often seen the sun\r\nrise in the country, but it was necessary to contemplate and study anew\r\nthat beautiful spectacle in order to describe it exactly; and early one\r\nmorning, long before the dawn, accompanied by two friends, I went to the\r\nhills of Vicalvaro, where we made some good studies, but were very much\r\nfrightened by some thieves who attacked us knife in hand, believing we\r\nwere people who carried watches.\"\r\n\r\nThese words of the author reveal better than we could explain his aim\r\nand method. He is a follower of Fernan Caballero, in so far as he has\r\ndevoted himself to illustrate the every-day life of the Spanish people.\r\nThe former writer has filled her pages with brilliant pictures of the\r\nlife of Andalusia. Her canvas is, however, larger than Trueba's: she\r\ndepicts the society of the South in all its grades; Trueba has chosen a\r\nmore limited circle on which he has lavished all his care.\r\n\r\nThe volume of _Rose-colored Tales_ is in many respects the best that\r\nTrueba has produced. The dedication to his wife explains the title and\r\nreveals the author's optimistic views. He says: \"I call them\r\n_Rose-colored Tales_ because they are the reverse of that pessimistic\r\nliterature which delights in representing the world as a boundless\r\ndesert in which no flower blooms, and life as a perpetual night in which\r\nno star shines. I, poor son of Adam, in whom the curse of the Lord on\r\nour first parents has not ceased to be accomplished a single day since\r\nthe time when, still a child, I left my beloved valley of the\r\nEncartaciones,--I shall love this life, and shall not believe myself\r\nexiled in the world while God, friendship, love and the family exist in\r\nit, while the sun shines on me every morning, while the moon lights me\r\nevery night and the flowers and birds visit me every day.\"\r\n\r\nThe scene of all the stories of this collection is in the Encartaciones,\r\nand an examination of a few of them will make us acquainted with the\r\nusual range of characters and the author's mode of treatment. The first\r\nis entitled \"The Resurrection of the Soul\" (_La Resurreccion del Alma_),\r\nand opens with an account of the village of C----, one of the fifteen\r\ncomposing the Encartaciones. Here lived Santiago and Catalina, the\r\nlatter a foundling whom Santiago's parents had found at their door one\r\nwinter morning. The good people, who had always desired a daughter,\r\ncared tenderly for the little stranger, and she grew up with their son,\r\nwho was a few years older. It had been decided that when Santiago was\r\nfifteen he should go to his uncle in Mexico; which country, for the\r\nsimple inhabitants of Biscay, is still \"India,\" and the retired\r\nmerchants who return to spend their last days in their native towns are\r\n\"Indians\"--a class that often play an important part in the denouement\r\nof Trueba's simple plots. At the beginning of the story the two children\r\n(Santiago was nearly fifteen) had gone off to play and allowed the goats\r\nto get into the fields. The angry father is about to punish Catalina,\r\nwho has assumed all the blame, but his wife mollifies him by reminding\r\nhim that they have received a piece of good news. Ramon good-humoredly\r\nsays, \"You women always have your own way,\" and proceeds to tell a story\r\nto illustrate it. We give it as an example of the popular tales that\r\nTrueba often weaves into his stories:\r\n\r\n\"Once upon a time, when Christ went through the world healing the sick\r\nand raising the dead, a woman came out to meet him and said to him,\r\nseizing hold of his cloak and weeping like a Magdalen, 'Lord, do me the\r\nfavor to come and raise my husband, who died this morning.'\r\n\r\n\"'I cannot stop,' answered the Lord. 'I am going to perform a great\r\nmiracle--that is, find a good mother among the women who are fond of\r\nbull-fights; but everything will turn out well if the ass doesn't stop.\r\nAll I can do for you is that if you take it into your head to raise your\r\nhusband, your husband will be raised.'\r\n\r\n\"And indeed the wife took it into her head that her husband must be\r\nraised, and her husband was raised, for even the dead can't resist the\r\nwhims of women.\"\r\n\r\nThe good news that Ramon had received was a letter from his brother, who\r\nwished Santiago to be sent to him by the first steamer leaving Bilbao.\r\nIt was the 15th of August, the Feast of the Assumption, when Santiago,\r\naccompanied by his father, prepared to start for Bilbao.\r\n\r\n\"Quica, who until the moment of departure had not shed a tear, because\r\nshe had only seen her son on the way to happiness, as you saw yours,\r\ndisconsolate mother, who now see only a sepulchre in the\r\nAmericas,--Quica now wept without restraint. Poor Catalina had wept so\r\nmuch for a month and a half that there were no tears left in her eyes:\r\nshe did not weep, but she felt the faintness and sorrow which the dying\r\nmust experience. Santiago's eyes were moist at times, but soon shone\r\nwith joy.\r\n\r\n\"'Come, come! You are like a lot of crying children,' exclaimed Ramon,\r\ntearing his son from the arms of Quica and Catalina. 'One would say that\r\nit is a matter to cry over. Don't you see me? I too have a soul in my\r\nsoul-case....'\r\n\r\n\"And indeed he had, for tears as large as nuts rolled from his eyes.\r\nSantiago and Ramon departed. Quica and Catalina sorrowfully followed\r\nthem with their eyes until they crossed a neighboring hill. Then the\r\nyoung girl made an almost supernatural effort to calm herself, and said,\r\n'Mother, I am going to take the sheep to the mountain.'\r\n\r\n\"'Do what you wish, my daughter,' answered Quica mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"It was Catalina's custom to open, the gate every morning to a flock of\r\nsheep and lead them a stone's throw from the farmhouse, where she left\r\nthem alone; but this day she went with them as far as the hill that\r\nRamon and Santiago had just crossed, and from that hill she went on to\r\nthe next and the next, with her eyes always fixed on the road to Bilbao,\r\nuntil, overcome by fatigue and dying with grief, she bowed her beautiful\r\nhead, and instead of retracing her steps to the farmhouse of Ipenza, she\r\nwent to the church in the valley and fell on her knees before the altar\r\nof the Virgin of Solitude.\"\r\n\r\nSantiago reaches Mexico in safety, and is kindly received by his uncle,\r\nwho dies ten years later and leaves him an immense fortune. Santiago at\r\nonce plunges into every species of dissipation, and soon destroys his\r\nhealth. His physician recommends him as a last resort to return to his\r\nnative country and try the effect of the mountain-air. Meanwhile,\r\nCatalina had grown up one of the prettiest girls of the village, and\r\nSantiago's parents had died, leaving her a handsome dowry and the use of\r\nthe farm until it should be claimed by Santiago.\r\n\r\n\"One dark and rainy night Santiago returned to his home, broken down in\r\nhealth and profoundly weary of life. Catalina receives him, and is\r\namazed at his changed appearance.\r\n\r\n\"'Are you ill, Santiago?' asked Catalina with infinite tenderness.\r\n\r\n\"'Yes--ill in body and mind.'\r\n\r\n\"'How do you feel, brother of my heart?'\r\n\r\n\"'I do not feel anything: that is my greatest misfortune.'\"\r\n\r\nIn truth, the unfortunate Santiago had lost all the better feelings of\r\nhis heart. His return to the home of his innocent boyhood failed to\r\nevoke any pure and noble sentiments: his heart continued paralyzed,\r\ncold, indifferent to everything. But it was impossible for him to remain\r\nin this condition under the influence of Catalina. He gradually began to\r\ntake an interest in the life around him and employ his wealth for the\r\nbenefit of his neighbors. Gradually, he awoke from his lethargy and\r\nbecame well in body and mind. As the reader can imagine, the story\r\ncloses with his marriage to Catalina, who had such a great share in his\r\nrecovery.\r\n\r\nIn the story called \"From One's Country to Heaven\" (_Desde la Patria al\r\nCielo_) the author's endeavors show that the surest happiness is to be\r\nfound in one's native village. He begins with an ironical description of\r\nthe village of S---- in the Encartaciones, in which he depicts the\r\nsimplicity of the inhabitants and their backwardness, in regard to the\r\nspirit of the age. In this village lived, among others, Teresa, a poor\r\nwidow, and her only child, Pedro. One day, while passing the palace of a\r\nwealthy \"Indian,\" he called her and said he was obliged to return to\r\nAmerica, and wished her to take care of his house during his absence.\r\nThe poor woman now saw herself relieved from want and able to educate\r\nher son. The latter found in the rich library of the \"Indian\" food for\r\nmany years of study, and soon became dissatisfied with his quiet life in\r\nthe village, and eager to travel and see the countries about which he\r\nhad read such charming tales. He soon grew to despise everything around\r\nhim, and treated with scorn his neighbor Rose, who had long loved him\r\ntenderly.\r\n\r\nOne day news arrived from Mexico that the \"Indian\" had died, leaving to\r\nTeresa his palace at S---- and a large sum of money besides. Pedro was\r\nnow able to fulfil his dreams of travel, and started on his journey. He\r\nfirst visits the Pass of Roncesvalles, and is nearly killed by the\r\nindignant Frenchmen whom he asks about the defeat of Charlemagne and the\r\nTwelve Peers. Pedro then proceeds to Bayonne, where he is so shocked by\r\nthe sight of young girls selling their hair to the highest bidder that\r\nhe determines to leave France, and we next find him in a Swiss chalet,\r\nwhere he is disgusted by the lack of cleanliness. His feelings can be\r\nimagined when he finds that the peasants have no popular traditions and\r\nare not acquainted even with the name of William Tell. In despair, Pedro\r\ndirects his course to Germany, but finds no sylphs or sirens on the\r\nbanks of the Rhine, while maidens with blue eyes and golden hair are no\r\nmore abundant there than elsewhere. Greece next receives the wanderer,\r\nwho hears in Athens of railroads and consolidated funds: on Olympus he\r\nfinds a guano manufactory, and on Pindus a poet writing\r\nfourteen-syllable endecasyllabics. He visits with a similar\r\ndisenchantment Constantinople, and then makes his way to England. There\r\npoor Pedro is disgusted by the sordid, selfish spirit of the people. An\r\nabsurd scene at a village church fills him with horror. The bare walls\r\nof the temple chill his heart, and after the service a domestic quarrel\r\nbetween the curate and his jealous wife caps the climax and Pedro flees\r\nto America. On landing in New York he is robbed of his watch: the thief\r\nis arrested, but gives the watch to the magistrate, keeping the chain\r\nfor himself, and Pedro is condemned to pay the costs and the damages\r\nsuffered by the thief's character. On returning that evening from the\r\ntheatre he is garroted and robbed of all he has with him. The landlord\r\ntells him that no one thinks of going out at night without a pair of\r\nsix-shooters, and adds that what happens in New York is nothing to what\r\ngoes on at Boston, Baltimore and New Orleans. The next day he reads an\r\neditorial in the _New York Herald_ advising American merchants to\r\nrepudiate their foreign debts. He then determines to visit the different\r\nStates, and on passing through the South thanks God that slavery is\r\nunknown in Europe. Railroad accidents, murders and political and social\r\ncorruption cause him to regard with profound horror the young republic,\r\nwhich seems to him old in vice, and he starts for South America, the\r\nSpanish part of which reminds him of a virgin overwhelmed with\r\nmisfortunes, but still full of youth and faith. In Vera Cruz, Pedro\r\nvisits the sepulchre of the \"Indian\" to whom he owes his fortune. A\r\nletter from his mother is awaiting him there, and he bursts into tears,\r\nand sails at once for his beloved home, which he reaches one beautiful\r\nSunday morning in May. His meeting with his mother takes place in the\r\nchurch, and there also he sees Rose, whose constancy is now rewarded.\r\nThe story closes with the lines from Lista: \"Happy he who has never seen\r\nany other stream than that of his native place, and, an old man, sleeps\r\nin the shade where he played a boy!\"\r\n\r\nAnother story of the same collection, and one of the author's best, is\r\nentitled _Juan Paloma_. The principal characters are Don Juan de\r\nUrrutia, nicknamed Juan Paloma (\"dovelike\"), a wealthy and crusty old\r\nbachelor, and Antonio de Molinar, a poor peasant, and his wife. The\r\nmoral of the story is in Don Juan's last words: \"Blessed be the family!\"\r\nand in Juana's remark: \"Alas for him who lives alone in the world, for\r\nonly his dogs will weep for him when he dies!\"\r\n\r\nThe other stories of this volume, \"The Mother-in-Law,\" \"The Judas of the\r\nHousehold\" and \"I Believe in God,\" all contain many charming scenes. In\r\nthe last a young girl is educated by an infidel father, and after his\r\ndeath marries Diego, a village lad. She becomes a mother, but still\r\nretains in her heart the seeds of atheism sown there by her father. Her\r\nchild, a girl, becomes ill, and a doctor is sent for from Bilbao.\r\n\r\n\"The doctor was long in coming, and Ascensita was devoured by impatience\r\nand uncertainty. He arrived at last, and examined the child attentively,\r\nobserving a deep silence, which caused the poor mother the most\r\nsorrowful anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"'Will the daughter of my heart recover?' Ascensita asked him in tears.\r\n'For God's sake, speak to me frankly, for this uncertainty is more cruel\r\nthan the death of my daughter.'\r\n\r\n\"'Senora,' answered the doctor, 'God alone can save the child.'\r\n\r\n\"Ascensita fell senseless by the side of the cradle containing her\r\ndying child. When she returned to herself Diego alone was at her side.\r\nThe unhappy mother placed her ear to the child's lips, and perceived\r\nthat it still breathed.\r\n\r\n\"'Diego,' she exclaimed, 'take care of the child of my soul!' and flying\r\ndown the stairs hastened to a hermitage near by, and falling on her\r\nknees before the Virgin of Consolation exclaimed in grief, 'Holy Virgin!\r\npity me! Save the child of my heart! And if she has flown to heaven\r\nsince I left her side to fall at thy feet, beg thy holy Son to restore\r\nher to life, as He did the maid of Galilee!'\r\n\r\n\"A woman who was praying in a corner of the temple arose weeping with\r\njoy and grief, and hastened to clasp the unhappy mother in her arms and\r\ncall her daughter. It was her husband's mother, Agustina, who had also\r\ngone to the temple to pray for the restoration of the child.\r\n\r\n\"'Mother,' exclaimed Ascensita, 'I believe in God! I believe in God and\r\nhope in His mercy!'\r\n\r\n\"'My daughter, no one believes in it in vain,' answered Agustina,\r\nbursting into tears. And both again knelt and prayed.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother's prayer was heard and the child recovered.\r\n\r\nIn the _Popular Narrations_, Trueba works up themes already popular\r\namong the people, but clothes them in his own words and varies them to\r\nsuit his own taste. He says in the preface: \"The task which I undertook\r\nsome time ago, and still continue, consists in collecting the\r\nnarrations, tales or anecdotes that circulate among the people and are\r\nthe work of the popular invention, which sometimes creates and at others\r\nimitates, if it does not plagiarize, trying when it imitates to give to\r\nthe imitation the form of the original. Some of the writers or\r\ncollectors abroad, and especially in Germany, who have devoted\r\nthemselves to a similar task, have followed a method different from\r\nmine; since, like the Brothers Grimm, they reproduce the popular tales\r\nalmost as they have collected them from the lips of the people. This\r\nsystem is not to my taste, because almost all popular tales, although\r\nthey have a precious base, have an absurd form, and in order to enter\r\nworthily into the products of the literary art they need to be perfected\r\nby art, and have a moral or philosophical end, which nothing in the\r\nsphere of art should be without.\"\r\n\r\nThe subjects of some of these stories are well known out of Spain. \"St.\r\nPeter's Doubts\" (_Las Dudas de San Pedro_) is as old as the _Gesta\r\nRomanorum_ (cap. 80), and is familiar to English readers from Parnell's\r\n_Hermit_. Another, \"A Century in a Moment\" (_Un Siglo en un Momento_),\r\nis the story of the woman allowed after death to come back to the earth\r\nand see her lover, whom she finds faithless. Still another,\r\n_Tragaldabas_, is familiar to the readers of Grimm's _Household Tales_,\r\nwhere it figures as \"Godfather Death.\"\r\n\r\nThe volume of _Popular Tales_ contains nineteen stories of the most\r\nvarying description. Some are popular in the broadest sense, as \"The\r\nThree Counsels\" (_Los Consejos_), in which a soldier whose time of\r\nservice has expired buys from his captain with his pay three pieces of\r\nadvice: Always take the short cut on a road, Do not inquire into what\r\ndoes not concern you, and Do nothing without reflection. The soldier on\r\nhis way home has occasion to put in practice all three counsels, and\r\nthereby saves his life and property. Others, are legendary, as _Ofero_,\r\nthe legend of St. Christopher, and _Casilda_, the story of the Moorish\r\nking's daughter converted to the Christian religion by a physician from\r\nJudea, who proves to be Our Lord. One, \"The Wife of the Architect\" (_La\r\nMujer del Arquitecto_), is a local tradition of Toledo, and another,\r\n\"The Prince without a Memory\" (_El Principe Desmemoriado_), is taken\r\nfrom Gracian Dantisco's _Galateo Espanol_.\r\n\r\nWe may say of this collection, as of the last, that, although the\r\nstories show much humor and skill, they are not among the author's best.\r\nHe is most at home in the simple pictures of life in the Encartaciones\r\nor in the country near Madrid. The latter is the scene of the stories\r\nin the volume entitled _Rural Tales_ (_Cuentos campesinos_), which\r\ncontains some of the author's most charming productions. They are\r\ngenerally longer than the others--one, \"Domestic Happiness\" (_La\r\nFelicidad domestica_), filling over ninety-two octavo pages. \"Seed-time\r\nand Harvest\" (_Las Siembras y las Cosechas_) is a charming story of Pepe\r\nand his wife Pepa, the former of whom sows wheat in his fields, and the\r\nlatter economy, love and virtue by the fireside. The best story of the\r\ncollection, however--and, to our mind, one of the best that Trueba has\r\nwritten--is the one called \"The Style is the Man\" (_El Estilo es el\r\nHombre_), which is so well worth a translation that we will not spoil it\r\nby an analysis.\r\n\r\nWe have said that Trueba's works have been great popular successes. He\r\nhas endeared himself to all who love poetry and the simple, honest life\r\nof the Spanish people. His beloved province has not forgotten him, and\r\nin 1862 unanimously elected him archivist and chronicler of Biscay, with\r\na salary of nine hundred dollars a year. The poet henceforth turned his\r\nattention to a history of Biscay, which has not yet appeared, though\r\nsome preliminary studies have been published in a work entitled\r\n_Chapters of a Book_ (_Capitulos de un Libro_). Trueba resided at this\r\nperiod of his life at Bilbao, which he was obliged to leave in haste\r\nduring the last Carlist war, and he has since lived in Madrid. He has\r\npublished there several volumes of romances and historical novels, some\r\nof which have been very successful; but Trueba's real strength is in his\r\npoetry and short stories, which may be favorably compared with the best\r\nof this class of literature--with Auerbach's _Tales of the Black\r\nForest_, for example. The reader is at once attracted to the author,\r\nwhose personality shines through most of his stories and is always\r\napparent in his poetry. Simple, honest, patriotic, religious, he is a\r\ntype of the best class of Spaniards--a class that will some day win for\r\ntheir country the respect of other nations and bring back a better glory\r\nthan that founded on conquest.\r\n\r\n  T. F. CRANE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH WINDING WAYS.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first meeting with Georgy Lenox on the seashore was not my last. The\r\nhabits of the family made it easy for us to have our interviews\r\nuninterrupted, and probably unperceived, for although we were all early\r\nrisers we rarely met each other till breakfast-time. Helen went to her\r\nfather's room at half-past seven, and they read and talked together\r\nuntil my mother called them at nine o'clock. As for my mother, purest of\r\nall women as she was, she felt she was not pure enough to meet the new\r\nday until she had spent an hour at her Bible and on her knees in prayer.\r\nThere is a light that comes out of the west sometimes toward evening\r\nafter a stormy day which seems to be sent straight from the fount of\r\nlight itself. Such light was always in my mother's eyes when I kissed\r\nher good-morning, and I knew it had come to her as she knelt on bended\r\nknees. She was tranquil in these days with a Heaven-born tranquillity,\r\nbut I know now that she had a pang of dread for every throb of love.\r\n\r\nShe spoke to me once of my increasing intimacy with Georgina. \"There is\r\nnothing you are concealing from me, Floyd?\" she said, her brown eyes\r\nreading my face.\r\n\r\nShe had come to my bedside after I had gone to rest for the night,\r\nimpelled by a restlessness to be certain that all was well with her dear\r\nones before she could close her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot think what you mean, mother,\" I answered. \"I have nothing to\r\nconceal.\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed. \"Georgy is a beautiful girl,\" she said quietly, \"but she\r\nbaits too many lures for men, Floyd. It seems to me she is trying to win\r\nyou, my dear boy. She is born to make men unhappy. Do not trust her. Oh,\r\nwhy is she here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because Helen has asked her to remain, mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"Helen pities her and tries to please her. She is one too many in the\r\nhouse, Floyd: she will do some harm to some of us. She is cold and\r\ntreacherous at heart, and she never sees us happy, contented together\r\nbut that she hates us every one.\"\r\n\r\nI thought my mother fanciful, and told her that she was prejudiced\r\nagainst the girl, who had grown up from infancy under her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I know her better than you do, mother,\" I affirmed stubbornly.\r\n\r\nShe smiled a patient, melancholy smile. \"If I am prejudiced,\" said she\r\ngently, \"it is because of what her misconduct cost my son years ago. Do\r\nyou think I can ever forget that but for her caprice and self-will you\r\nwould never have had those years of suffering, Floyd? But we women know\r\neach other. It is at times a sad knowledge, and for our prescience the\r\nmen whom we would serve misjudge us and tell us we hate each other.\r\nGeorgina is in love this summer. You do not guess what man she has set\r\nher wishes upon?\"\r\n\r\nI stirred restlessly on my pillow, but I looked at her with something\r\nlike anger against her growing in my heart.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, mother,\" I returned. \"It is none of my business to read any\r\ngirl's heart through a sister-woman's cold trained eyes. If Miss Lenox\r\nis in love, God bless her! I say. I suppose I am not the lucky fellow.\"\r\n\r\nMy mother kissed me softly on my forehead and went out; and, alas! it\r\nwas many a day afterward before there was perfect peace and confidence\r\nbetween us again. Not that we were cold or constrained--indeed, we were\r\nmore than ever gentle and tender in our ways ... but there was a subject\r\nwhich was heavy on our hearts of which we were not again to speak, and\r\nthere may have been a meaning in my face which she did not venture to\r\nread, for I resented it if her look fastened upon me too closely.\r\n\r\nBut the pleasant country-house life went on quite unchecked by events of\r\nany sort. Few visitors were admitted, and it was understood at the Point\r\nthat rigid seclusion from all society was the will of Miss Floyd. The\r\nyoung girl was much talked about: she held every advantage of youth,\r\nbeauty, enormous wealth, and, almost more than all these, she possessed\r\nthat prestige which inheres in families that maintain quietly and\r\nproudly their reserve, dignity and indifference to the transitory\r\nfashions of society. Georgy Lenox became more and more involved in the\r\nwatering-place dissipations as the season advanced and the hotels\r\nfilled. She came and went in shimmering toilettes of all hues with an\r\nair of radiant enjoyment, but her outgoings and incomings disturbed no\r\none but myself. Helen would kiss her and tell her there was no one half\r\nso beautiful; Mr. Floyd would lean back in his chair and smile at her\r\nwith the admiration in his eyes that all men who are not churls feel it\r\na discourtesy to withhold from a pretty woman; and even my mother, with\r\na conscientious wish to do her duty by the young girl, would inquire\r\ncarefully about every chaperone, every invitation, and would herself\r\ndirect what time the carriage should be sent to bring her home.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken of our pleasant labors together in the study over\r\npoor Mr. Raymond's papers. Many a treasure did Mr. Floyd and Helen find\r\nthere. After the death of his daughter Mr. Raymond had jealously taken\r\npossession of every scrap of paper which belonged to her, and now her\r\nhusband was at last to see a hundred testimonials of her love for him of\r\nwhich he had never dreamed. There was the young girl's journal before\r\nshe was married, bound in blue velvet and clasped with gold: there were\r\nthe letters the poor little woman had written, shuddering before her\r\ngreat trial, to the husband and the child who should survive her. I\r\nbelieve all young mothers on the threshold of outward and visible\r\nmaternity believe they are to die in their agony, but these tokens of\r\nhis young wife's unspoken dread touched Mr. Floyd so closely we almost\r\nhad cause to regret that he had seen them.\r\n\r\n\"She never told me of her premonition of death,\" he said to my mother\r\nover and over again. \"She seemed very glad and proud that she was going\r\nto bring me a little child.\"\r\n\r\nHelen had run off with her blue velvet-covered book.\r\n\r\n\"Some time,\" said Mr. Floyd, \"I want to read every word she wrote, but\r\nthese letters are enough now: I can bear nothing more.\" And even these\r\nhe could not well endure until my mother had talked them over with him\r\nagain and again.\r\n\r\nThe quiet, happy life which we led in these days suited Mr. Floyd's\r\nhealth, and there was no recurrence of the alarming symptoms which had\r\nfilled me with dread a few months before. \"I begin to think,\" he\r\nremarked often, \"that by continuing this life, as simple as that which a\r\nbird leads flying from bough to bough, I am to grow stout and elderly,\r\nand go on getting gray, rubicund, with an amplitude of white waistcoat,\r\nuntil I am seventy years of age or so. My father and mother each died\r\nyoung, but both by accident as it were: the habit of both families was\r\nof long life and great strength. I confess I should like to live for a\r\ngood many years yet. I suppose Helen will marry by and by. I should like\r\nto be a witness of her happiness, rounded, full, complete, sanctified by\r\nmotherhood. Think, Mary, of my holding Helen's children on my knee!\"\r\n\r\n\"I think often of grandmotherhood myself,\" my mother replied. \"It is a\r\nsymptom of advancing age, James.\"\r\n\r\nI heard the talk, but Helen was far enough from guessing what plans her\r\nfather was forming for his ultimate satisfaction, and I could fancy her\r\nsuperb disdain at such mention. It was easy for me to see that her love\r\nfor her father was quite enough for her: she invested it with all the\r\ncharming prettinesses that a dainty coquette uses with her lover. She\r\nwas arch, gay, imperious, tender, all in a breath: I confess that I\r\noften felt that, let her once put forth her might, not Georgy Lenox\r\ncould be more winning, sweet and seductive. But all her tenderness was\r\nfor her father: with me she was sometimes proud and shy, sometimes\r\nwearing the manner of a loving little child. I often called her \"little\r\nsister\" in those days, and so, and in no other wise, I held her. When\r\nshe was kind, we had pleasant talks together: when she treated me with\r\ncoolness and reserve, I laughed and let her go. Her father needed her,\r\nand I did not; and I paid scant attention to her little caprices,\r\nalthough I scolded her for them now and then.\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to treat me as you treat Thorpe?\" I would ask. \"I am not a\r\ntame cat yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do I treat Mr. Thorpe?\" she inquired. \"I intend to treat him as I\r\ndo the man who places my chair.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't always manage that, my dear child. For instance, last night,\r\nwhen you were going to sing, you showed plainly that you were vexed at\r\nhis officiousness in opening the piano and placing your stool for you,\r\nand declined singing at once. Now, had Mills performed those slight\r\nservices you would have said coolly, 'Thank you, Mills,' and not have\r\nwasted a thought on the matter more than if some interior mechanism had\r\nraised the cover of the instrument.\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mr. Thorpe looks at me as Mills would never dare to look. He\r\nthrusts his personality upon me,\" exclaimed Helen in a small fury. \"Let\r\nhim pay his compliments to Georgy: I do not want them. Think of it! he\r\ncalled me Miss Helen this morning!\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you tell him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I told him nothing: I looked----\"\r\n\r\n\"I pity him then: I know how you can look.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I so dreadful?\" she asked coaxingly. \"Tell me how to behave to young\r\ngentlemen, Floyd. Really, I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me you should behave in the most affectionate manner, mademoiselle.\r\nGranted that, the more disdainful you are to other fellows the more I\r\nshall admire you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, since you are in earnest, dear child, if I were you I would show\r\nnothing but kindness to my friends.\r\n\r\n  Bright as the sun, her eyes the gazers strike;\r\n  But, like the sun, they shine on all alike,\r\n\r\nis a very pretty description of the manner of a successful woman.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot be like that,\" she cried plaintively. \"Would you like me\r\nto treat you and Mr. Thorpe in precisely the same way, Floyd?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all. Don't count me in with the rest of your admirers: I must\r\nhave the first, best, dearest place.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you always do,\" she remonstrated in a tone of injury. \"You\r\ncome next after papa. If I behave badly to you sometimes, it is because\r\nI like to see if you mind my putting on little airs.\" That was candor.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Miss Kitten,\" said I, \"you seem to know how to behave to young\r\nmen. I shall waste no more advice upon you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd indeed she did not require it. She possessed in an exquisite degree\r\nthat gift of a delightful manner which generally comes through\r\ninheritance, and cannot be perfectly gained by education. But my\r\nsuggestion regarding Thorpe bore fruit, and henceforward she was a\r\nlittle more queenly and indifferent to him than ever, but never\r\ndisplayed pique or asperity. Yet, however badly she treated him, he\r\nquite deserved my title of a \"tame cat:\" he bore every reverse\r\npatiently, and indeed at times displayed an absolute heroism in the face\r\nof her indifference, going on in fluent recital of something he believed\r\nwould interest her while she utterly ignored him and his subject.\r\nHowever, Thorpe was a good actor, and could play his part, and do it\r\nwell, in spite of his audience. I sometimes fancied that he was less\r\ncheerful in those times than he seemed. In fact, I was ready to believe\r\nthat he was in reality, as he was in pretence, seeking to win Helen's\r\nattention. Mr. Floyd looked at the matter in the same light.\r\n\r\n\"When he gets his conge he cannot complain of having received\r\nencouragement,\" he said once or twice. \"But he's no fool: can it be that\r\nhe is in love with Miss Lenox all the time, and that he tries to pique\r\nher with a show of devotion to Helen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tony Thorpe will never be in love with a poor girl,\" I replied: \"there\r\nis nothing of that sort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't like Helen's having lovers,\" said Mr. Floyd. \"When I married my\r\nwife it was the pleasantest thing in the world to know that no other man\r\nhad ever breathed a word of love in her ears. 'The hand of little\r\nemployment hath the daintier sense.' The first sound of a lover's voice\r\nbrings a thrill to a girl's heart which she never knows but once. Miss\r\nLenox's perceptions in that way must be considerably toughened:\r\nsole-leather is nothing in thickness compared to the epidermis of a\r\ncoquette's heart. Now, a man can love with delicacy, fervor, passion a\r\nscore of times. Women are frail creatures, are they not? I would like to\r\nhave my little girl give her heart once, receive unbounded love in\r\nreturn, and never think of another man all her life. But Fate will\r\nmanage her affairs for her, as for us all.\"\r\n\r\nI have said that my morning interviews with Miss Lenox on the beach\r\ncontinued for a time. Suddenly they ceased: she came to the rendezvous\r\nno more, and it was impossible for me to get near enough to her to seek\r\nan explanation. I had felt quite dissipated and like a man of the world\r\nwhen I jumped out of my bed half awake each morning with an appointment\r\non my hands. I had not told myself that it was bliss to meet her, and in\r\nfact had smiled a little at the recollection that it had been she who\r\nhad asked me to join her ramble. Once or twice I had designated the\r\nwhole thing a bore, and had wished it might rain and let me have a\r\ncomfortable morning's nap instead of an hour or two with the most\r\nbeautiful of girls at a romantic trysting-place. But most men deceive\r\nthemselves about their feelings concerning women. When the first time I\r\ndid not find Georgina awaiting me (for my orders were to join her walk,\r\nnot to have her join mine) I lay on the rocks and took a nap until\r\nThorpe came along the beach as usual and awoke me. But when I had failed\r\nto find her the second morning I was restless and disturbed. After two\r\nmore fruitless quests I grew by turns insanely jealous and wretchedly\r\nself-distrustful.\r\n\r\nHad I vexed her? What had I said? what had I done? I went over and over\r\nagain every word of our talks: every mood of hers, every blush and\r\nglance and smile, lived again for me. We had spoken of many things those\r\nmornings we had met, yet there had been small reference to our mutual\r\nrelations; and certainly if there were love-making on my part, it had\r\ncolored none of our moods to any passion. I had travelled and seen many\r\npeople: I had been introduced in courts, and had, by Mr. Floyd's\r\ninfluence, penetrated into an exclusive and brilliant continental\r\nsociety, where I had found much to observe. These reminiscences of mine\r\nhad delighted Georgina: she had the irresistible feminine instinct for\r\ndetails, the analysis of which made a mastery of brilliant results\r\neasily attainable to her who possessed, to begin with, remarkable\r\nbeauty, and, if not tact, so bewildering a way of doing what she chose\r\nthat in the eyes of men at least she lacked nothing which grace and good\r\ntaste could teach her. She was always anxious, too, to hear everything\r\nconcerning Mr. Floyd--his friends abroad, his habits, his _vie intime_\r\nat certain houses which had been his favorite lounge for years while he\r\nwas minister at ----. Garrulity was by no means my habit in those days,\r\nbut I had talked to her very freely: indeed, she could do with me what\r\nshe wished.\r\n\r\nBut why had she suddenly given me up? Had she tired of me, exhausted me,\r\nwrung my mind dry of interest; and flung me by like a squeezed orange? I\r\nlay in wait for her in the passages that I might speak to her, but she\r\nseemed never to be alone any more. I would lurk in her path for hours,\r\nonly to be rewarded by the sight of her dress vanishing in another\r\ndirection. I wrote her notes, to none of which would she reply. \"If a\r\nwoman flies, she flies to be pursued,\" I had heard all my life. Elusive,\r\nmocking goddess that she was, I felt every day more and more ardent in\r\nmy pursuit, yet I rarely saw her now except at breakfast, when she was\r\ndemure, a little weary, and altogether indifferent to me. I determined\r\nto follow her into society.\r\n\r\nIt was early in July now, and the watering-place life was at its gayest.\r\nI had hitherto accepted no invitations, from respect for the habits of\r\nthe house where I was staying, but now I examined with interest every\r\ncard and note brought to me. Accordingly, I set out on a round of\r\npleasure-seeking, which soon transformed me from a boy whose foolish aim\r\nin life was to be as clever as other men into an impassioned lover.\r\nOther men may look back upon their first love with a certain pleasing\r\nsentimentality: in spite of all the years that now lie between me and\r\nthe fever of those few months at The Headlands, I still suffer bitterly\r\nfrom the recollection of that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had gone with Georgina to a picnic one day at her request, meeting her\r\nat the house of Mrs. Woodruff, with whom she was staying for a\r\nfortnight, at the Point. The picnic meant merely a drive for miles back\r\ninto the country and a lunch in the woods prepared by a French cook, but\r\nit was a delightful road through shadows of tall forest trees, the glare\r\nof sunlight alternating with green copsewood coolness. They were cutting\r\nthe grass and clover in the fields, and the air was fresh with the scent\r\nof new-mown hay: half the land on either side of us was covered with\r\nripening grain, and the light breeze that played perpetually over it\r\ngave us endless shimmerings and glimmerings of wonderful light almost as\r\nbeautiful as the tints that play over the sea.\r\n\r\nI had every need to find the beauty of the summer gracious to me that\r\nday. It was but another of many days when every throb of my feeling for\r\nGeorgy Lenox became an anguish hard to bear. She was opposite me as we\r\nrode through the fair country, but she neither looked at nor spoke to\r\nme. I was much lionized, however, by Mrs. Woodruff, a pretty, faded,\r\ncoquettish woman, who had been balancing herself on the very edge of\r\nproprieties for years, but who still, thanks to a certain weariness she\r\ncompelled in men, was yet safe enough in her position as a matron.\r\nGeorgy's companion was a titled foreigner just then a favorite at the\r\nPoint, but of whom I need not speak.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ask me to come that I might hear you talk with the count?\" I\r\nasked her when once that day I had a chance to address her.\r\n\r\n\"But the count would talk to me,\" she returned, laughing. \"Do you\r\nsuppose I care for him? I think him the most odious man I know, with his\r\nwaxed moustache, his small green eyes, his wicked mouth and teeth. But\r\nMrs. Woodruff is dying for him, and half the women here hate me in their\r\nhearts because he pays me attention. I like you infinitely better,\r\nFloyd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then come away and sit upon the rocks with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I cannot afford to do those romantic, compromising things. You see\r\nthat, as we are both staying at The Headlands, where everybody's\r\ncuriosity is centred this summer, we are much observed, much commented\r\nupon.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me you are not at all afraid of compromising yourself with\r\nother men.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now you are cross and jealous. Perhaps if you betrayed a little less\r\ninterest in me you might make me less afraid of concession. And you must\r\nnot watch me so: the count himself spoke about your eyes ready to burn\r\nme with their melancholy fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hang the count!\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart! I am tired of his hanging about me, however. Now go\r\naway: at the dance to-night I will talk to you all you wish.\"\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of beautiful girls at the picnic, and not a few of\r\nthem sat outside the circle quite neglected or wandered away like\r\nschool-girls in couples, picking ferns and gathering pale wood-blossoms;\r\nbut since I could not speak to Georgina at my ease, there seemed to me\r\nneither meaning nor occupation for the slowly-passing hours. I have\r\nsometimes wondered how those women feel to whom society brings no\r\nhomage, no real social intercourse, who sit outside the groups formed\r\naround their more brilliant sisters and behold their easy triumphs. They\r\nseem patient and good-natured, but must they not wonder in their hearts\r\nwhy one woman's face and figure are a magnet compelling every man to\r\ncome within the circle of her attraction, while others, not less fair\r\nand sweet, seem depolarized?\r\n\r\nGeorgy had many successful days, and this was but one of them. She\r\nunderstood allurement now not as an accident, but as a science, and she\r\npractised it cleverly. She had already heard bold language from the\r\ncount, so held him in check as he sat beside her, giving him at times,\r\nhowever, \"a side glance and look down,\" and to his trained habits of\r\nobservation showed constantly that she was perfectly aware of his\r\npresence even if she seemed to ignore him. She was openly flirting with\r\nFrank Woolsey (a cousin of mine), but since she knew him for a veteran\r\nwhose admiration only counted to lookers-on, she consoled herself by\r\nother little diversions, and scarcely a man there but felt his pulses\r\ntingle as she sent him a bright word or a careless smile.\r\n\r\nThorpe was there, but dull, moody, distrait, and he joined me and poured\r\ninto my ears his disgust at this form of entertainment. He had eaten\r\nants in his salad, he affirmed, his wine was corked, his _pate_ spoiled.\r\n\r\n\"What are we here for?\" he asked. \"I see no reason in it. I suppose Miss\r\nLenox is enjoying herself, and she thinks the men about her are in a\r\nseventh heaven. What do even the cleverest women know about the men they\r\nmeet? Woolsey hates her like poison; the count is on the lookout for a\r\n_belle heritiere_ and is yawning over his loss of time; and I doubt if\r\none of that group except Talbot would marry her. I don't think many of\r\nus are pleased with that sort of thing. We don't want too fierce a light\r\nto beat about the woman we are dreaming of. She has no love or respect\r\nfor sweetness and womanly virtue for their own sake--no faith in their\r\nvalue to her, further than that the semblance of them may attract\r\nadmirers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're out of humor, Thorpe,\" said I: \"don't vent it on her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I _am_ out of humor,\" he exclaimed, \"devilishly out of humor! For God's\r\nsake, Randolph, tell me if you think I have any chance with Miss Floyd.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Thorpe,\" I returned under my breath: \"I have no business to\r\nmake any suppositions concerning that young lady, but I will say just\r\nthis much. Do you see that bird in the air hovering above that oak\r\ntree?\"\r\n\r\nHe followed my look upward toward the unfathomable blue. \"I do,\" he\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\n\"I think there is just as much chance of that bird's coming down at your\r\ncall and nestling in your bosom as there is of your winning the young\r\nlady you allude to.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked crestfallen for a moment: then his thorough coxcombry resumed\r\nits sway. \"You see,\" said he, with a consummate air of reserve, \"you\r\nknow nothing about the affair at all, Randolph.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd much better drop the subject, Thorpe,\" I remarked: \"I assure you\r\nit's much safer let alone.\"\r\n\r\nI contrived to live through the long hours of the day. At sunset we\r\ndrove back to the Point, I giving up my seat in Mrs. Woodruff's barouche\r\nto a lady and joining Frank Woolsey and Thorpe in a dog-cart. We none of\r\nus spoke, but smoked incessantly, our eyes upturned to the sky, which\r\nwas lovely, mystical, wonderful, with the pale after-glow thrilling it\r\nwith the most beautiful hues. Before we had reached the town a strange\r\nyellow moonlight had crept over the landscape, making the trees gloom\r\ntogether in solemn masses, while the sea glimmered in a thousand lines\r\nof trembling light away, away into remote horizons. We all enjoyed the\r\ndrive, although none of us spoke until we got down from the cart at the\r\nsteps of the hotel.\r\n\r\n\"That was the best part of the day,\" observed my cousin Frank. \"What\r\ngood times we fellows might have if there were no women to disturb us!\"\r\n\r\nThorpe growled some inarticulate assent or dissent, as the case might\r\nbe, and went up to his room, while Frank and I had our cigars out on the\r\npiazza.\r\n\r\nA dance at Mrs. Woodruff's was to follow the picnic, and thither we\r\nresorted about ten o'clock and found the chairs placed for a German.\r\nGeorgy Lenox was there, radiant in a ravishing toilette, waiting for\r\nFrank to lead the cotillon with her. She nodded to me pleasantly as she\r\ntook her seat. I was angry with myself for my disappointment, doubly\r\nangry with her for causing it. It cost me my self-respect to be so\r\nutterly at her mercy. What did I gain by following her into this gay\r\ncoterie but pang upon pang of humiliation and pain? Why did I come,\r\nindeed? It was not the first time she had broken her promises to me. Yet\r\nwhat could I expect of her? Bright, gay, dazzling creature that she was,\r\nwarm and eager in her love of vigorous life, could she sit down with me\r\nin a corner and talk while the rest of the world palpitated and glowed\r\nand whirled around her to the music of the waltz, which stirred even my\r\ncrippled limbs with a wild wish for voluptuous swaying motion in rhythm\r\nwith the melodious melancholy strain? No, I could not blame her: I was\r\nmerely out of my place. Let me go home and remember what a gulf of\r\ndisparity separated me from my fellows.\r\n\r\nSo I walked out of the house through the grounds into the street, and\r\nalong the road home to The Headlands. It was a long walk for me, yet I\r\novercame the distance quickly, and long before eleven o'clock gained the\r\nhouse, entered quietly and sat down beside my mother on her sofa, unseen\r\nby Mr. Floyd and Helen, who were in the next room.\r\n\r\nI was half mad with baffled desire, blind anger and fatigue that night,\r\nand the sound of Helen's voice as she sang some song like a lullaby was\r\nlike a blessing. My mother did not speak to me; only smiled gently in my\r\nface and kissed me on my forehead. Her tenderness touched my heart, and\r\nmy head drooped to her shoulder, then to her lap, and I lay there like a\r\nboy comforted by his mother's touch, just as I was. A kind of peaceful\r\nstupor came over me. Helen went on singing some quiet German piece of\r\nwhich her father was fond, with many verses and a sweet, moving story.\r\nHer voice was delicious in its way, with a noble and simple style, and a\r\npathetic charm in some of its cadences I never heard surpassed. Mr.\r\nFloyd never tired of hearing her. After a time the ballad came to an\r\nend.\r\n\r\n\"Floyd has come, papa,\" I heard her say.\r\n\r\n\"Why, no! Has he? so early?\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on singing, Helen,\" whispered my mother. \"Floyd has gone to sleep.\"\r\n\r\nShe sang something soft, cooing, monotonous, a strain a mother might\r\nsing as she hushed her baby at her breast: then she came out, followed\r\nby her father, and both sat down beside us. I, half shyly, half through\r\ndread of talking, went on counterfeiting sleep.\r\n\r\n\"Poor boy!\" exclaimed Mr. Floyd. \"He has evidently walked back from the\r\nPoint. He was tired out with his dissipations, or Miss Georgina was\r\ncoquetting with other men or ate too much to suit him. If I were in love\r\nto extremity of passion with Miss Lenox, or rather with her brilliant\r\nflesh-tints and her hands and feet, I should recover the moment I saw\r\nher at table. She is the frankest gourmande I ever saw, and will be\r\nstout in five years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, papa, Georgy's hands and feet are nothing so particular.\"\r\n\r\n\"Helen's are smaller and much better shaped,\" said my mother jealously.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mary, how little you understand the points of a woman! Helen has\r\nhands that I kiss\"--and he kissed them--\"the most beautiful hands in the\r\nworld; and she has feet whose very shoe-tie I adore; but, nevertheless,\r\nthere is nothing aggressive about her insteps and ankles. She considers\r\nher feet made to walk with, not to captivate men with.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should hope not,\" said Lady Disdain, with plenty of her chief\r\nattribute in her voice. \"I prefer that nobody should know I have any\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is just it. Now, Miss Lenox never comes in or goes out of a room\r\nbut every man there knows the color of her stockings.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am ashamed of you, papa!--Scold him, Mrs. Randolph. I think him quite\r\nhorrid.\"\r\n\r\n\"Since, my mouse, you don't want to be admired for your feet and hands,\r\nwhat points of your beauty may we venture to obtrude our notice upon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you may love me for whatever you like. But I don't want other\r\npeople ever to think of me in that way at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your intellect is a safe point, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not want anybody to love me at all, papa, except yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not even Floyd?\"\r\n\r\n\"Floyd would never be silly,\" Helen said indignantly. \"Floyd likes me\r\nbecause we are old friends: he knew grandpa and you, papa, and all\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are easily satisfied if you are contented with affection on the\r\nscore of your aged relatives.\"\r\n\r\n\"How soundly he sleeps!\" murmured Helen; and I knew that she bent close\r\nto me as she spoke, for I could feel the warmth of her young cheeks.\r\nHalf to frighten her, half because I wanted to see how she looked as she\r\nregarded me, I suddenly opened my eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You weren't asleep at all!\" she exclaimed, laughing and quite\r\nunembarrassed. \"But I think you were wicked to hoax us so. Did you hear\r\neverything we said?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Helen,\" I said, \"I was fast asleep, I do believe, until you\r\nconfessed your affection for me. You did not expect me to sleep through\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\nShe stared at me blankly, then looked at the others with dilating eyes.\r\n\"Did I say anything about that?\" she asked, growing pale even to her\r\nlips and tears gathering in her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Why, no, you foolish child!\" said her father, drawing her upon his\r\nknee: \"he is only teasing you. As if anybody had any affection for one\r\nof the Seven Sleepers!--Well, Floyd, how happened you to come back so\r\nsoon? The carriage was going for you at midnight.--Here, Mills, Mr.\r\nRandolph has already returned, and the coachman may go to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The day was pretty long,\" I returned. \"I had had enough of it, and so\r\nset out and walked back. I was well tired out when I came in, and that\r\nput me to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a shame for you to walk so far,\" exclaimed Helen imperiously:\r\n\"you are not strong enough for such an effort. There are eight horses in\r\nthe stables, every one of them pawing in his stall, longing for a\r\ngallop, and for you to be obliged to walk four miles! Don't do such a\r\ndreadful thing again, Floyd.\"\r\n\r\nI sprang up and limped about, feeling impatient and cross. \"In spite of\r\nmy poor leg,\" I returned, \"I am a fair walker. Don't set me down as a\r\nhelpless cripple, Helen.\"\r\n\r\nI was bitter and wrathful still, or I trust I was too magnanimous to\r\nhave wounded her so.\r\n\r\n\"Floyd!\" exclaimed my mother in a tone of reproof; but I did not turn,\r\nand went down the long suite of parlors and stood at the great window\r\nwhich overlooked the sea. It was all open to the summer night, and the\r\nlace curtains waved to and fro in the breeze. Solemnly came up the\r\nrhythmic flow of the waves as they beat against the rocks. I pushed\r\naside the draperies and looked out at the wide expanse of waters lying,\r\nit seemed, almost at my feet, for everything else but the great silver\r\nplain of sea was in shadow. Above, the moon had it all her own way\r\nto-night: the constellations shone pale, and seemed weary of the\r\nfirmament which at other times they span and compass with their myriad\r\nsplendors. Mars moved in a stately way straight along above the southern\r\nhorizon to his couch in the west: even his red light was dim.\r\n\r\nBut what stillness and peace seemed possible beneath this throbbing sea?\r\nI sighed as I listened to the sound of the waves and gazed at the great\r\ngolden pathway of the moon across the silver waters. I knew that some\r\none had followed me and stood timidly behind me: I guessed it was Helen,\r\nbut did not know until a slim satin hand stole into mine, for surely it\r\nwas not my mother's hand. Hers was warm and firm in its pressure: the\r\ntouch of this was soft and cool like a rose-leaf. I held the hand close,\r\nbut did not turn.\r\n\r\n\"Floyd!\" she whispered timidly, \"dear Floyd!\"\r\n\r\n\"I hear you, Helen,\" I returned wearily.\r\n\r\n\"Are you angry with me? Do not be angry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am only angry with myself: I am not behaving well to-night.\"\r\n\r\nShe came in front of me and looked up in my face. \"I don't want you to\r\nthink,\" she said in a little faint trembling voice, \"that--that I--that\r\nI--\" She quite broke down.\r\n\r\n\"I really don't know what you mean, Helen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Floyd,\" she cried passionately, \"I think I would die before I would\r\nwilfully hurt your feelings!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, my poor little girl,\" said I, quite touched at the sight of her\r\nquivering face and the sound of her impassioned voice, \"you did not hurt\r\nmy feelings for an instant. What I said was in answer to my own\r\nthoughts. I like to say such things to myself at times, and remember\r\nthat I do not possess the advantages of other men. Besides, facts are\r\nfacts: I am lame. I cannot dance, and although I can walk, it is with a\r\nlimping gait: I should be a poor fellow in a foot-race. I don't suppose\r\nthat my being a cripple will forfeit me anything in the kingdom of\r\nheaven, but, nevertheless, it obliges me to forego a good many pleasures\r\nhere on earth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not a cripple!\" she burst out impetuously. \"You have every\r\nadvantage! What is it that you cannot dance? I despise men who whirl\r\nabout like puppets: I have never seen them waltzing but they must make\r\nthemselves ridiculous. I am glad you cannot dance: you are on the level\r\nof too much dignity and noble behavior to condescend to such petty\r\nthings. And surely you do not want to run a foot-race!\" she added with\r\nan intensity of disdain which made me laugh, high-wrought and painful\r\nalthough my mood was. Then her lip trembled, and I saw tears in her eyes\r\nas she went on. \"If you were a cripple,\" she pursued in a low, eager\r\nvoice, \"really a helpless cripple, everybody would love you just the\r\nsame. Why, Floyd, what do you think it is to me that, as you say, you do\r\nnot possess the advantages of other men? Have you forgotten how it all\r\ncame about? I was a little girl then, but there is nothing that happened\r\nyesterday clearer to my memory than that terrible morning when I cost\r\nyou so dear. I know how I felt--as if forsaken by the world. I wondered\r\nif God looked down and saw me, alone, in danger, blind and dizzy and\r\ntrembling, so that again and again I seemed to be slipping away from\r\neverything that held me. I could not have stayed one minute more had I\r\nnot heard your voice. You were so strong, so kind, Floyd! When you\r\nreached me your hands were bleeding, your face scratched and torn, your\r\nbreath came in great pants, but you looked at me and smiled. And then\r\nyou carried me to the top and put me in safety, and I let you go down,\r\ndown, down!\" She was quite speechless, and leaned her cheek against my\r\nhand, which she still held, and wet it freely with her tears.\r\n\r\n\"If you mind your lameness,\" she said brokenly, with intervals of\r\nsobs--\"if you feel that Fate is cruel to you--that there is any reason\r\nwhy you cannot be perfectly happy--then I wish,\" she exclaimed with\r\nenergy, \"that I had never been born to do you this great injury. I love\r\nmy life, I love papa, I love your mother and you, and it seems to me as\r\nif I were going to be a very happy woman; but still, if you carry any\r\nregret for that day in your heart, I wish I had died when I was so sick\r\nbefore you came: I wish I lay up there on the hill with the grass\r\ngrowing over me.\"\r\n\r\nWhat was anybody to do with this overwrought, fanciful child? She was so\r\nwonderfully pretty too, with her great dark, melancholy eyes, her\r\nflushed, tear-stained cheeks, her rich rare lips! \"Oh, Helen,\" I\r\nmurmured, holding her close to me, \"I don't want you to go under the\r\ngreen grass: I'm very glad you are alive. I would have broken all my\r\nbones in your service that day and welcome, so that you might be well\r\nand unhurt. Come, now, cheer up: I am going to be a pleasanter fellow\r\nthan I have been of late. Dry your eyes, dear. Your father will be\r\nlaughing at you. Come, let us go and take a stroll in the moonlight: it\r\nis quite wicked not to indulge in a little romance on a sweet midsummer\r\nnight like this.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I had gone to my room that night, and sat, still bitter, still\r\ndiscontented, looking off through my open window toward the Point, and\r\nwondering who was looking in Georgy Lenox's starry eyes just\r\nthen--thinking, with a feeling about my forehead like a band of burning\r\niron, that some man's arm was sure to be about her waist, her face\r\nupturned to his, her floating golden hair across his shoulder as they\r\ndanced,--while, I say, such fancies held a firm clutch over my brain and\r\nsenses, devouring me with the throes of an insane jealousy, my mother\r\ncame in and sat down beside me.\r\n\r\n\"My dear boy,\" she said, putting her hand on my shoulder, \"I am going to\r\ngive you a caution. You must remember that Helen, with all her frankness\r\nand impetuosity, is still no child. Don't win her heart unthinkingly.\"\r\n\r\nI felt the blood rush to my face, and I think I had never in all my life\r\nexperienced such embarrassment.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not such a coxcomb, mother, as to believe any girl could fall in\r\nlove with me--Helen above all others.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled, with a little inward amusement in her smile. \"You must\r\nremember,\" she said again softly, \"that Helen is not a child, and you\r\nsurely would not make her suffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, mother,\" I gasped, \"we are just like brother and sister: our\r\nintimacy is the habit of years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good-night, my son,\" my mother said, and went away still smiling: \"I\r\nhave perfect faith in your magnanimity.\"\r\n\r\nI remembered with a flash of guilty self-consciousness one or two\r\nlittle circumstances about our talk by the window two hours before which\r\nI have not set down here. It had seemed an easy task to soothe the\r\nchild. If there had been any absurdity like that my mother hinted at,\r\nwould she--could I-- No, never! She was a careless child, with fits of\r\ncoldness, imperious tenderness and generosity. Not a woman at all. The\r\nidea was quite distasteful to me that Helen was a grown-up woman with\r\nwhom I must be on my guard.\r\n\r\nHowever, Helen's manner to me next day and at all times was calculated\r\nto assure any man that she was a wilful, self-sustained young creature\r\nof extraordinary beauty and grace, who was devoted to her father, and to\r\nhim alone. I saw Thorpe one evening pick up, by stealth, the petals of a\r\ncrimson rose which had dropped from the stalk that still nestled in the\r\nblack ribbon at her throat, and I laughed at him for his pains as he\r\nlaid them carefully away in his pocket-book.\r\n\r\n\"Miss Floyd,\" said I, \"here is another rose. Don't honor that poor\r\nskeleton of a vanished flower.\"\r\n\r\nShe saw the accident which had befallen her rose, and took mine from me\r\nand replaced her ornament with a fresh blossom. \"Give me the poor stem,\"\r\nsaid I as she was about to throw it away.\r\n\r\n\"What is that for?\" she asked, staring at me as I placed it in my\r\nbuttonhole. \"What do you want of the poor old thing?\"\r\n\r\nAnd, mistrusting some mischief beneath my sentimental behavior, she was\r\nquite tart with me the entire evening, and would not speak to Thorpe at\r\nall, but sat demurely between my mother and Mr. Floyd, her eyes nailed\r\non some embroidery, and behaving altogether like a spoiled child of\r\ntwelve years old.\r\n\r\nGeorgy Lenox had returned from her visit at Mrs. Woodruff's, and seemed\r\na little quiet and weary of late. I was not so much at her service as\r\nbefore, but had begun to console myself by teaching in song what, like\r\nother young poets, I had experienced in suffering. I thank Heaven that\r\nno eyes but my own ever beheld the tragedy I wrote that summer: still,\r\nI am a little tender-hearted over it yet, and believe that it was, after\r\nall, not so bad as it might have been. At any rate, it enabled me to\r\nfind some relief from my passionate unrest in occupation, and even my\r\nown high-sounding phrases may have taught me some scanty heroism. After\r\nall, if one fights one's own battle bravely, does it make so much matter\r\nabout other things? Our battles to-day, like the rest of those fought\r\nsince creation, show poor cause if regarded from any other standpoint\r\nsave the necessity of fighting them. Most of our fiercest struggles for\r\nlife have no adequate reason: it is not so necessary for us to live as\r\nwe think it is. That we do not get what we want, or that we sink beneath\r\nour load of trouble, signifies little in the aggregate of the world's\r\nhistory. But, all the same, our cries of despair go up to Heaven, and\r\nthere seems no need in the universe so absolute, so final, as that we\r\nourselves should live and be happy.\r\n\r\nIt is hard for a man of middle age, with a cool brain and tranquillized\r\npassions, to retrace the history of his youth. There is much that he\r\nmust smile over--much, too, which is irksome for him to dwell upon. Many\r\nexperiences which in their freshness seemed holy and sacred, in after\r\nyears, stripped of their disguise of false sentiment and the aureole\r\nwith which they were invested by youthful imagination, become absolutely\r\nloathsome--just as when we see tamely by daylight the tawdry stage which\r\nlast night made a world for us full of all the paraphernalia of high\r\nromanticism--silver and velvet robes, plumed hats, dim woodland vistas\r\nand the echo of a distant high note, youthful beauty, rope-ladders,\r\nbalconies, daggers, poison, and passionate love-strains. This skeleton\r\nframework of the illusion, these well-worn contrivances, tarnished gold\r\nlace and mock splendors, disenchant us sadly, and what we took for\r\n\r\n  Horns of Elfland faintly blowing!\r\n  Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:\r\n  Blow, bugle: answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying,\r\n\r\nis now discovered to be a cheap-trumpet imitation of the enchanted\r\nnotes we dreamed of hearing.\r\n\r\nAfter Miss Lenox returned from the Point she was, as I have said, a\r\nlittle pensive: this little shadow upon the splendor of her beauty lent\r\na subtlety and charm to her manner. If there had been a fault in her\r\nloveliness before, it was that it remained always equal: the same light\r\nseemed always to play over face and hair, the liquid clearness of her\r\neyes was always undimmed, and there was a trifle of over-robustness\r\nabout the rounded contours of her figure. In spite of all her beauty, it\r\nhad at times been hard for me to realize that she was a woman to give\r\nherself thoroughly to love. I had already had many dreams of her, yet\r\nnever one where I thought she could have given me the infinite softness\r\nof a caressing touch or feel the motherly quality which lies at the\r\nbottom of every true woman's love for man. Now the splendor of her eyes\r\nwas veiled, her smile was half melancholy, her voice less clear and\r\nringing.\r\n\r\nWhen a man loves a woman, and her mood changes and softens, he reads but\r\none meaning in her tenderness; and it was not long before I had begun\r\nfully to believe that there was hope for me. There seemed to be no one\r\nto meddle in my wooing. True, Judge Talbot came constantly to the house\r\nto see Miss Lenox, and lacked none of the signs by which we read a man's\r\nerrand in his demeanor; but I did not fear any rivalry from him. Youth,\r\nat any rate, is something in itself, independent of other advantages: no\r\nwonder it vaunts itself and believes in its own power. That Georgy would\r\nthink for an instant of giving herself to this man did not seriously\r\noccur to me. His face was like the face of thousands of successful men\r\nwhom we see daily in the great marts of the world. His forehead was\r\nbroad but low, his eyes inclined to smallness and set closely together,\r\nhis brows shaggy and overhanging: his cheeks were heavy, and the fleshy\r\nformation of his mouth and chin denoted both cruelty and sensuality. He\r\nwas a wealthy man: such men are always rich. He had the reputation of\r\nholding an iron grip over everything he claimed, and never letting it\r\ngo. He had been married in early life, and now had sons and daughters\r\npast the age of the girl upon whom he was eagerly pressing his suit.\r\n\r\nHe came to dinner now and then, and over his wine he was noisy,\r\nboisterous and bragging. He had been in Congress with Mr. Floyd years\r\nbefore, and, though of different parties, they had innumerable\r\nrecollections in common, and, much as I disliked Mr. Talbot, I\r\nrecognized his cleverness in anecdote and the clearness and conciseness\r\nof his narratives. I could endure him among men, but with women he was\r\nodious, and, for some reasons occult and inexplicable to any man, plumed\r\nhimself upon his success with them. He understood himself too well, and\r\nrelied too entirely upon his natural abilities, to make any effort to\r\nhide his gross ignorance upon all subjects requiring either literary or\r\nmental culture. He had been eminently successful without any such\r\nacquirements in every field he entered, and consequently considered them\r\nnon-essentials in a man's career--very good to have, like the cream and\r\nconfectionery at dessert, tickling the palates of women and children,\r\nbut eschewed by sensible men. He had travelled twice over Europe, seeing\r\neverything with the voracious curiosity of a strong man eager to get his\r\nmoney's worth: after his experience of cities rich in high historic\r\ncharm, works of art where the rapture and exaltation of long-vanished\r\nlives have been exultingly fixed in wonderful colors or imperishable\r\nmarbles, he had carried away merely a hubbub of recollections of places\r\nwhere the best wines were found and his miseries at being reduced in\r\ncertain cases to the position of a deaf-mute through his inability to\r\ngrapple with the difficulties of foreign tongues.\r\n\r\nNo, it did not in those days occur to me that I had a rival in Mr.\r\nTalbot. Helen and I used to laugh at his crass ignorance, and mystify\r\nhim now and then by our allusions. Miss Lenox was never vivacious at\r\ntable, and used to listen languidly to all of us, turning to me now and\r\nthen and regarding me with a sort of pleased curiosity when she thought\r\nI overmatched her heavy admirer.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, I had turned to composition as an amusement, an\r\noccupation, and perhaps a refuge from feelings which were rapidly\r\nbecoming an ever-present pain. I recall one day when I had sat for hours\r\nat my desk writing busily, utterly wrapped up in my fancies--so\r\nengrossed, indeed, that when I had finished my work I looked with\r\nastonishment at my watch and discovered that it was long past two\r\no'clock. I rose and went to the window, pushed aside the curtains and\r\nthrew open the blinds, and gazed out. I overlooked the garden, which was\r\ndeserted except by the bees and humming-birds busy among the flowers.\r\nThe mid-day heat had passed, and a breeze rustled the leaves and moaned\r\nin the pine trees. It was a fair world, and I felt what one often\r\nexperiences in coming back to reality after high emotion--a sort of\r\nstrangeness in the beauty of tree and grass and sea and wood.\r\n\r\nWhile I stood there some one advanced along the garden-path, looked up,\r\nsaw me and beckoned. It was but a moment's effort to join her, and\r\nalmost before I had realized what I was doing I was beside Miss Lenox in\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\n\"Come and sit down in the arbor,\" she said softly.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I returned, remembering that I had sworn to myself not to yield to\r\nher caprices, \"I am going for a walk.\"\r\n\r\nShe regarded me pensively. \"May I go?\" she asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, you may go, Georgy,\" I said with a little laugh. \"I am only too\r\nhappy, I am afraid, if you ask to go anywhere with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't take me where it is wet,\" she observed simply, \"for I have on\r\nthin slippers;\" and she stretched out a little foot.\r\n\r\n\"I will take care of you,\" I answered her.\r\n\r\nShe took up the folds of her full white dress in her hands, and we set\r\nout. The mood was upon me to take the old paths across the sloping\r\nuplands into the woods on the hill that Helen and I had tramped over so\r\noften in our childhood. Beneath us lay the sea, a wide plain of placid\r\nwaters, blue in the foreground, with opal tints playing over it as it\r\nspread out toward the horizon; above us were the woods luxuriant in\r\ntheir midsummer verdure, silent except for the occasional note of a wild\r\nbird; and about us were the green fields, fresh mown of late, with\r\nthickets of grape and wild convolvulus and star-wreathed\r\nblackberry-vines making a luxuriant tangle over the fences.\r\n\r\nGeorgy walked before me in the narrow path, and I followed closely,\r\nwatching her fine free movements, the charm of her figure in its plain\r\nwhite morning-dress bound at the waist with a purple ribbon. Her\r\ngolden-yellow hair lay in curls upon her shoulders: now and then I\r\ncaught a glimpse of the contour of her face as she half turned to see if\r\nI were close behind her. Neither of us spoke for a long time.\r\n\r\nMy own thoughts flew about like leaves in a wind, but I wondered of what\r\nshe was thinking. Although I had known her all my life, she was not easy\r\nfor me to understand; or rather my impressions of her at this time were\r\nso colored by the passion of my own hopes that it was impossible for me\r\nto find a clew to her real feelings. Perhaps she was thinking of Jack:\r\nshe was thinking--I was sure she was thinking--of something sweet, sad\r\nand strange, or she could not have looked so beautiful.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she stopped in her walk and uttered a little cry. \"It is wet\r\nhere,\" she cried with vexation: \"we must turn back, Floyd.\"\r\n\r\n\"I said I would take care of you,\" I exclaimed quickly, and putting my\r\narms about her I raised her and carried her safely over the spot where a\r\nhundred springs trickled up to the surface and made a morass of the\r\nluxuriant grass. I did not set her down at once. For weeks now, sleeping\r\nand waking, I had been haunted by a fierce longing to hold her to my\r\nheart as I held her now, and it was not so easy to put by so great a\r\njoy. When at last I reached the stile I released her, and she sat down\r\non the stone and looked at me with a half smile.\r\n\r\n\"If you call that taking care of me, Floyd--\" said she, shaking her\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n\"You are not angry with me, Georgina?\"\r\n\r\n\"How could I be angry with you?\" she said, putting out her hand to me\r\nand speaking so kindly that I dared to press her little rosy palm to my\r\nlips. \"But how strong you are, Floyd! You carried me like a feather's\r\nweight, and yet I am tall and very heavy. You know how to take care of\r\nme, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I might always take care of you!\" I said, my heart beating and the\r\nblood rushing to my face. \"I can carry you home if you will. Don't you\r\nremember about the Laird of Bothwick declaring that no man should marry\r\nhis daughter save the one who should carry her three miles up the\r\nmountain-side? If I could have such a chance with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"But about the daughter of the old laird: did she find a lover so strong\r\nas to carry her to the mountain-top?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes: one of her suitors took her in his arms and strode along, crying,\r\n'Love gives me strength--love gives me speed.' However, he was not happy\r\nafter all, poor fellow! When he reached the goal he died. How could he\r\nhave died then?\"\r\n\r\n\"What did the young lady do?\" inquired Georgy, laughing. \"I suppose\r\nanother lover rode by her side as she walked home, and that she married\r\nhim for his pains. That is the way the brave men of the world are\r\nrewarded, Floyd. Don't be too generous, nor too strong, nor too\r\nself-forgetful. You will gain nothing by it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that I shall not gain you, Georgy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I said nothing about myself. Why do you ask me all these questions\r\nas soon as we are alone? I am afraid sometimes to let you talk to me,\r\nalthough there are few people in the world whom I like so well to have\r\nnear me. Women will always love you dearly, Floyd. You are so gentle, so\r\nharmonious with pleasant thoughts and pleasant doings: you seem less\r\nselfish and vain than other men. You deserve that some woman should\r\nmake you very happy, Floyd.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is but one woman who can do it, Georgy.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not so sure of that. I do not know why you think of me at all:\r\nwhat is it about me that attracts you? Helen is younger than I am--a\r\nhundred times more beautiful. No, sir, you need make no such\r\ndemonstrations. If you like my poor face best, it is because we are old\r\nfriends, and you are so true, so kind, to the old memories. Do not\r\ninterrupt me yet. I think you are blind to your own interests when you\r\npass Helen by: she is so rich that if you marry her you can live a life\r\nlike a prince.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if I do not wish to lead a prince's life, Georgy?\" said I, a little\r\nnettled at the indifference which must prompt such comparisons of Helen\r\nto herself. \"Nothing could induce me to marry a rich woman, even if\r\nHelen were to be thought of by a poor fellow like me. I have no vague\r\ndreams about the future: my hopes are clear and definite. I want a\r\ncareer carved by my own industry, my own taste: I want--above all\r\nthings, I want--the wife of whom I am always thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is she, my poor boy?\"\r\n\r\n\"You know very well, Georgy,\" I returned, throwing myself beside her and\r\ngazing up into her face. \"Since I was a little fellow in Belfield, and\r\nused to look out of the school-room window with Jack Holt, and see you\r\ngoing past the church with your red jacket and your curls on your\r\nshoulders, I have had just one dream of the girl I could love so well\r\nthat I could die for her. I used to lie on the hilltop then and fancy\r\nmyself a bold knight on a white steed who should gallop down those\r\nsunshiny streets and seize you in his arms, raise you to the saddle and\r\ncarry you away into Fairyland to live with him for ever. My longing has\r\nnot changed: I want the same thing still.\"\r\n\r\n\"But when I was to marry Jack you did not seem to mind,\" said Georgina,\r\nlooking at me with that new pensiveness she had learned of late.\r\n\r\n\"You knew my heart very little. When Jack told me that you were still\r\nfree, I hated myself, my joy, my renewal of hope, seemed so\r\ncontemptibly little in contrast with his great despair. I would not have\r\nwronged him. God knows, I pity him when I remember what he has lost!\r\nStill, I too loved you as a child: I never had it in my power to serve\r\nyou, but I had no other thought but you. Why may it not be, dear? Who\r\ncan love you better than I do? Even although I am not rich, who will\r\ntake better care of you than I shall? I am sure you love me a little. Do\r\nnot put the feeling by, but think of it: do not deny it--let it have its\r\nchance.\"\r\n\r\nShe rose with an absent air. \"We must go on,\" she said dreamily; and I\r\nhelped her over the stile, and we walked slowly through the wood. She\r\nleaned upon my arm, but her face was downcast, and her broad hat\r\nconcealed it from me.\r\n\r\n\"I wish,\" I said after a time, \"you would let me know some of those\r\nthoughts.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked up at me pale but smiling. \"Do you know, Floyd,\" she\r\nmurmured, \"I do think you could make me happy if anybody could.\"\r\n\r\n\"Promise me that I may have the chance. End now, Georgy, all your\r\ndoubts, all my fears. You will be happier so.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we should be poor!\" she cried sharply. \"I could not be contented to\r\nmarry a poor man. You may be clever, Floyd--I do not know much about\r\ncleverness in men--but, all the same, it is hard for a man to make money\r\nuntil he has worked for many, many years. I could not wait for you. I am\r\nolder than you, and everybody is wondering why, with all my\r\nopportunities, I have not married. You'd much better give me up,\" she\r\nadded, looking into my face steadily and smiling, although her lip\r\ntrembled, \"and let Mr. Talbot have me. He is rich, and can marry me at\r\nonce. He is waiting for my answer now, and it is best that I should, as\r\nyou say, end it all.\"\r\n\r\nI shuddered as this pang disturbed my warm bliss. \"For Heaven's sake,\r\ndon't joke, Georgy!\" I exclaimed. \"I can't even hear you allude to the\r\npossibility of marrying such a man as that with equanimity. I am not so\r\npoor. Mr. Floyd--\" But, after all, I could not tell her of Mr. Floyd's\r\ngenerosity to me: it seemed like basing calculations upon his death to\r\nassure her that the course of events was to bring me a fortune.\r\n\r\nShe looked at me with eagerness. \"Tell me now,\" she said, putting her\r\nhand upon my arm. \"If you love me, Floyd, you cannot keep a secret from\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nTo describe the beauty of her face, the fascination of her manner, the\r\nthrill of her touch, words are quite powerless, mere pen-scratches. If\r\nany man could have withstood her, I was not that man. Shame to relate, I\r\nsoon had told her everything--that Mr. Floyd had for years placed an\r\nample income at my disposal--that I had seen his will, which gave me,\r\nwithout restriction, a clear third of his fortune.\r\n\r\nShe was meditative for a while. \"But,\" she said then with a trifle of\r\nbrusqueness, \"if you marry me he will be angry and change all that: he\r\ndoes not like me. He has different plans for you: he wants you to marry\r\nHelen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't say that,\" I cried, \"for I love Mr. Floyd so well, I owe him so\r\nmuch, I could refuse him nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean that if he asked you to marry Helen you would give me up,\r\nwould take her?\" she retorted with a flaming color on her cheeks and a\r\ngleam in her eyes. \"You do not care for me, then. You are merely\r\nplaying with me: you love her, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, that is nonsense, Georgy,\" I said gently, for through her jealousy\r\nI had the first glimpse, I fancied, of something like real love for me;\r\n\"and I do not like to hear Helen's name bandied about in this way. You\r\nmay be sure that she will stand in no need of suitors: I shall never be\r\none of them. Now, then, who is it that is coquetting? You know whom I\r\nlove--what I want. I am very much in earnest--unsettled in heart and\r\nmind, body, soul and spirit, until I have your answer. Tell me, Georgy\r\ndarling, is it or is it not to be?\"\r\n\r\nBut I was to have no answer that day. Miss Lenox said it was very\r\ntiresome hearing me reiterate that dreary question, and that she saw\r\nraspberries in the thicket which I must gather for her. Although, when\r\nshe had eaten them, she let me kiss the lovely stained lips, I was still\r\nfar enough from knowing whether they were mine or not--whether she liked\r\nto raise my ardent dreams merely to disappoint them, or whether at heart\r\nit was, as she sometimes hinted, that she did care for me with something\r\nof the intimate, clinging habit which bound _me_ so closely to _her_.\r\n\r\n  ELLEN W. OLNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[TO BE CONTINUED.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAWN IN THE CITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The city slowly wakes:\r\n    Her every chimney makes\r\n  Offering of smoke against the cool white skies:\r\n    Slowly the morning shakes\r\n    The lingering shadowy flakes\r\n  Of night from doors and windows, from the city's eyes.\r\n\r\n    A breath through heaven goes:\r\n    Leaves of the pale sweet rose\r\n  Are strewn along the clouds of upper air.\r\n    Healer of ancient woes,\r\n    The palm of dawn bestows\r\n  On feverish temples peace, comfort on grim despair.\r\n\r\n    Now the celestial fire\r\n    Fingers the sunken spire;\r\n  Crocket by crocket slowly creepeth down;\r\n    Brushes the maze of wire,\r\n    Dewy, electric lyre,\r\n  And with a silent hymn one moment fills the town.\r\n\r\n    Over emergent roofs\r\n    A sound of pattering hoofs\r\n  And anxious bleatings tells the passing herd:\r\n    Scared by the piteous droves,\r\n    A shoal of skurrying doves,\r\n  Veering, around the island of the church has whirred.\r\n\r\n    Soon through the smoky haze,\r\n    The park begins to raise\r\n  Its outlines clearer into daylit prose:\r\n    Ever with fresh amaze\r\n    The sleepless fountains praise\r\n  Morn, that has gilt the city as it gilds the rose.\r\n\r\n    High in the clearer air\r\n    The smoke now builds a stair\r\n  Leading to realms no wing of bird has found:\r\n    Things are more foul, more fair;\r\n    A distant clock, somewhere,\r\n  Strikes, and the dreamer starts at clear reverberant sound.\r\n\r\n    Farther the tide of dark\r\n    Drains from each square and park:\r\n  Here is a city fresh and new create,\r\n    Wondrous as though the ark\r\n    Should once again disbark\r\n  On a remoulded world its safe and joyous freight.\r\n\r\n    Ebbs all the dark, and now\r\n    Life eddies to and fro\r\n  By pier and alley, street and avenue:\r\n    The myriads stir below,\r\n    As hives of coral grow--\r\n  Vaulted above, like them, with a fresh sea of blue.\r\n\r\n  CHARLES DE KAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PARIS EXPOSITION OF 1878.\r\n\r\nIV.--MACHINERY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPLEBY'S STEAM-CRANE, WITH FIXED JIB FOR USE ON\r\nTEMPORARY OR PERMANENT TRACK.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe machinery in the Paris Exposition covers a larger space than any\r\nother of the eight departments of material, machinery and products which\r\noccupy the buildings and annexes. The ninth department, Horticulture, is\r\noutdoors on the grounds or in greenhouses. Foreign machinery has about\r\nhalf the space, and French machinery the remainder. Few countries are\r\nwithout annexes, the space allotted to each, though supposed to be\r\nample, being utterly insufficient to hold the multitude of objects\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nIn preference to taking the classes of machinery in turn, and visiting\r\nthe various nations in search of exemplars of the classes in rotation,\r\nit will be more interesting to take the nations in order and arrive at\r\nan idea of the rate and direction of their relative progress, modified\r\nso largely by the respective natural productions of the countries and by\r\nthe habits and degrees of civilization of their inhabitants. When put to\r\na trial of its strength, each nation naturally brings forward the\r\nmatters in which it particularly excels.\r\n\r\nProminent in the section of the Netherlands, the name so descriptive of\r\nthe land where not less than two hundred and twenty-three thousand acres\r\nare below the level of the sea and kept constantly drained by artificial\r\nmeans, are the engineering and mechanical devices for the reclamation\r\nand preservation of land, the formation of outlet-canals for the centres\r\nof commerce, and the bridging of the rivers and estuaries which\r\nintersect the maritime portions of the country. Some of the models and\r\nrelief-maps were shown in the Netherlands section in the Main Building\r\nat Philadelphia, but the exhibition is more perfect here, as much has\r\nbeen added in the two intervening years.\r\n\r\nThe works for the drainage of the Haarlemmer Meer illustrate the means\r\nemployed for the last great drainage-work completed. This lake had an\r\narea of 45,230 acres, an average depth of seventeen feet below low\r\nwater, and was drained between 1848 and 1853. Being diked to exclude the\r\nwaters which naturally flowed into it, three large engines were built in\r\ndifferent places around it, and the work of pumping out 800,000,000 tons\r\nof water commenced. The engines have cylinders of twelve feet diameter,\r\nand are capable of lifting 2,000,000 tons of water in twenty-four hours\r\nfrom the depth of seventeen feet to the level of the _boezem_, or\r\ncatch-water basin, of the district. The boezem carries the water to the\r\nsea, into which it discharges by sluices at Katwyk on the North Sea and\r\nat Sparndam and Halfweg on the Y, or the southern end of the Zuyder Zee.\r\nThe land reclaimed is now in excellent tillage, and one farm on the\r\ntract is referred to in agricultural journals as one of the three model\r\nfarms of the world. The three engines are called the Leeghwater, the\r\nCruquius and the Lynden, from three celebrated engineers who had at\r\ndifferent times proposed plans for draining the Haarlemmer Meer.\r\nProposals for its drainage were made by one of these engineers as far\r\nback as 1663. The next enterprise in hand is the drainage of the\r\nsouthern lobe of the Zuyder Zee, which is stated to have an average\r\ndepth of thirteen feet, and it is intended to cut it off by a dike from\r\nthe northern basin and erect sufficient engines around it to pump it out\r\nin thirteen years at the rate of a foot a year, working night and day.\r\n\r\nAnother engineering device, very necessary in a land where foundations\r\nare so frequently built under water, is the enclosed caisson with\r\ncompressed air, as shown in detail in this exhibit. It was originally\r\ninvented by M. Triger to keep the water expelled from the sheet-iron\r\ncylinders which he sunk through quick-sands in reaching the\r\ncoal-measures in the vicinity of the river Loire in France. The seams of\r\ncoal in this district lie under a stratum of quicksand from fifty-eight\r\nto sixty-six feet in thickness, and they had been inaccessible by all\r\nthe ordinary modes of mining previously practised. The system has been\r\nmuch amplified and improved since, especially in sinking the foundations\r\nof the St. Louis and the New York East River bridges, and does not\r\nrequire specific description. An improved air-lock, by which access is\r\ngiven from the exterior to the working chamber at the part where the men\r\nwork in an atmosphere sufficiently condensed to exclude water from the\r\nlower open end--like a tumbler inverted in water--is the principal\r\naddition which America has made to the device.\r\n\r\nWe need not go abroad to find long bridges, but the great bridge, with\r\nthree immense iron trusses and eight smaller ones, over the Wahal near\r\nBommell would be respectable anywhere. Our Louisville bridge is a\r\nparallel example for length, but the truss is different.\r\n\r\nThe dikes and jetties of the new embouchure of the Meuse embrace the\r\nsame features of extending a river's banks into deep water, and by\r\nconfining the stream making it scour out its own bed, as now so\r\nsuccessfully practised by Captain Eads in one of the passes of the\r\nMississippi River. Limbs and saplings made into gabions and staked\r\ntogether form mattresses, and by loading with stone are sunk in\r\nposition. They soon become silted up, and are practically solid. Others\r\nare made and laid upon them _ad libitum_, and at last raise the crest\r\nabove the level of the sea, the last course being laid with the\r\nadvantage of high-water spring tides. This foundation supports courses\r\nof pitched masonry on its side, and these protect the stone or gravel\r\nembankment, which forms a roadbed. The river's water, instead of, as\r\nformerly, depositing its silt at the embouchure as its motion is\r\narrested on reaching the open sea, carries its silt along and deposits\r\nit farther out: if a favorable shore-current occurs, it is swept away\r\nlaterally, and so disposed of.\r\n\r\nThe maritime canal of Amsterdam is another late success of this\r\nremarkable people, which leads the world in dikes and drainage of low\r\nlands, as the Italian does in the art and area of irrigation. The\r\npresent canal may satisfy the great and still rising commerce of\r\nAmsterdam, the previous ship-canal, fifty-one miles in length, built in\r\n1819-25 at a cost of $4,250,000, and deep and wide enough to float two\r\npassing frigates, having proved insufficient.\r\n\r\nBelgium is happily situated, and well provided by Nature and art to\r\nenter into any competitive trial. With admirable skill, great provision\r\nof iron and coal and a people of economical habits that permit them to\r\nwork at low wages without being impoverished, she is, besides working\r\nup her own abundant material, rolling the iron of England into rails,\r\nand making it into locomotives for Great Britain, whose own people lack\r\nthe work thus done abroad. The \"Societe Cockerill-Seraing\" has an\r\nenormous space devoted to the machinery for the exploitation of iron.\r\nCompressed forgings in car-wheels and other shapes are piled on the\r\nfloor, and a whole railway rail-rolling mill train is shown in motion.\r\nTwo of the rolls are stated to have rolled 10,500 tons of steel rails,\r\nand are in apparent good order yet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEELOCK'S AUTOMATIC CUT-OFF STEAM-ENGINE.]\r\n\r\nThe Belgium system of sinking shafts for mines and wells, invented by\r\nKind and Chaudron, exhibited here as in Philadelphia, attracts great\r\nattention from its gigantic proportions. Imagine an immense\r\nboring-chisel (_trepan_), weighing 26,000 pounds and with a breadth of\r\nover six feet, worked up and down by machinery, the steel studs on its\r\nface stamping the rocks into dust, so that they can be removed with a\r\nbucket with bottom valves which is dropped into the hole and is worked\r\nup and down until the detritus and water, if any, creep into it, when it\r\nis withdrawn and emptied. The repetition of these processes makes the\r\nshaft of two metres diameter. Then comes the larger trepan, with a width\r\nof 4.80 metres, and repeats the process on a larger scale. This enormous\r\nchisel weighs 44,000 pounds. The system is much in favor, and forty-five\r\nshafts have been thus sunk between 1854 and 1877 in Belgium, France,\r\nEngland and Germany. Cast-iron lining is lowered in sections as the\r\nshaft deepens, the sections being added at the top and bolted together.\r\n\r\nThe Belgian exhibit contains also one of those immense paper-machines\r\ninvented by the brothers Fourdrinier about fifty years ago, and now used\r\nalmost universally for the best class of machine-made papers. They are\r\nused by Wilcox at Glen Falls, Delaware county, Penn., in making the\r\ngovernment note and bond paper, and are a marvel of art. The Frenchmen\r\nwho invented the machine brought it into use in England, but they were\r\nmuch hampered and discouraged by difficulties, and it was never a\r\npecuniary success to them. It was a legacy to the future, and they have\r\njoined the army of martyrs to mechanical science. The machine in the\r\nBelgian section is one hundred and thirty feet long, and the Swiss\r\nmachine, near by, is nearly as large. The French, with their customary\r\ningenuity, have reduced the proportions very considerably. The Swiss\r\nmachine makes paper one metre and a half wide.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the Belgian exhibit of machinery may be summarized:\r\nrock drills on the principle of those used at Mont Cenis; the\r\ngas-engines of Otto; machine tools, lathes, drills and planers; a very\r\ncurious machine for cutting bevel or straight gears, built by a firm at\r\nLiege, and worthy of attention by Mr. Sellers or Mr. Corliss, whose\r\ningenious machines for the same purpose were at Philadelphia; the\r\nwoollen machinery of Celestine Martin of Verviers, which I recollect to\r\nhave seen in Philadelphia also; multitubular boilers, rudder propeller,\r\nand hand fire-engines Then we see a number of locomotives and tramway\r\nengines, rail and street cars, winding, mining, crane and portable\r\nengines, and a full set of vacuum-pans for sugar, with engines,\r\ncentrifugal filters and hydraulic presses. A glance at Guibal's great\r\nmine-ventilator fan, fifty feet in diameter and with ten wooden vanes,\r\nand we may quit the section of Belgium, which is the next largest after\r\nEngland of all the foreign departments here.\r\n\r\nThe exhibition of Denmark is principally agricultural machinery, its\r\niron ploughs being copies of the English, and its reapers of the\r\nAmerican, while the dairy machines and apparatus are its own, and very\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nThe embroidering-machine of Hurtu & Hautin is shown working in the Swiss\r\nsection, and is a great success. The web or cloth to be embroidered is\r\nstretched between horizontal rollers in a vertical frame which hangs\r\nsuspended in the machine from the shorter end of a lever above. On each\r\nside of this floating frame is a track on which a carriage alternately\r\napproaches and recedes. Each carriage carries as many nippers in a row\r\nas equals the number of needles, which in this case is two hundred and\r\ntwelve. The needles have an eye in the middle and are pointed at each\r\nend. The carriage advances, the nippers holding the threaded needles,\r\nand pushes them through the cloth: the nippers on the other side are\r\nwaiting to receive them and shut upon them, those which have just thrust\r\nthem into the cloth opening automatically; the second carriage retreats\r\nand draws the silk through the cloth with the requisite tightness, and\r\nthen comes forward, thrusting the other end of the needles through the\r\ncloth to be grasped by the nippers on the first carriage, and so on. The\r\nframe holding the cloth is moved by an arrangement of levers under the\r\ncontrol of the operator, who conducts a tracer point on the long end of\r\nthe lever over the design, which is suspended before him. The frame\r\nmoves in obedience to the action of the tracer, but in a minified\r\ndegree, and each needle repeats on a scale of one-twentieth the design\r\nover which the tracer is moved step by step between each stitch. Thus\r\ntwo hundred and twelve embroideries according to a prescribed pattern\r\nare made by each needle; and, in fact, though it was not stated, to\r\navoid complicating the description, a second row of a similar number of\r\nneedles is carried by the same carriages and operates upon a second web\r\nstretched between another pair of rollers in the same floating frame.\r\nThe object of the rollers is to reel off new cloth as the embroidery\r\nprogresses and to reel on the work done. A similar machine is shown in\r\nthe French section, in the Salle de l'Ecole Militaire.\r\n\r\nThe Jacquard loom is shown in many sections--Swiss, French, United\r\nStates, English and others--principally upon silk handkerchiefs and\r\nmotto-ribbons. The exhibit of carpet-weaving is far inferior to the\r\nPhiladelphian. The Swiss exhibit of machinery for making paper of wood\r\npulp is very large and ample, but the Belgian annex shows the finest and\r\nlargest varieties of paper so made to be found in the Exposition. The\r\npaper, white and of various colors, made from about forty trees and\r\ntwenty different straws, grasses and forage-plants, is shown in large\r\nrolls.\r\n\r\nOf Russia there is not much to say except as regards the work of the\r\nEcole Imperiale Technique de Moscou. This is a remarkable\r\nexemplification of tools, methods of work, parts of engines and\r\nmachines, all finished with extreme care and fitted with great nicety.\r\nIt is fuller than it was in Philadelphia, but many of the portions are\r\nreadily recognizable. The machine tools, hydraulic presses, stationary\r\nengines and hand fire-engines are closely associated with the military\r\nand naval objects, cannons, ambulances, field-forges and an excellent\r\nlifeboat, systeme de Bojarsky.\r\n\r\nAustria comes with no more striking exhibit than the malteries and\r\nbreweries of Nobak Freres and Fritze. The immense extent of the\r\nmagazines for barley and hops; the size and height of the malteries,\r\nwhere by continuous processes the grain is damped, sprouted and dried\r\nand the malt ground; the number and capacity of the various vessels in\r\nwhich the infusions of malt and hops are made and mixed; and the\r\napparently interminable series of engines, pumps and pipes by which the\r\nsteam and liquids are conducted,--are confusing until some study\r\nevolves order out of the apparent confusion. The wort is cooled\r\nartificially, time being a great object as well as the saving of aroma,\r\nand the yet innocent liquid is poured in a torrent into the\r\nfermentation-vats, where Nature will have her own way and eliminate the\r\ningredients which convert the mawkish wort into the sparkling and\r\nrefreshing beer. Four hundred and fifty of these establishments have\r\nbeen erected by this firm in Europe; which must be some comfort to\r\nthose, not vignerons, who think the prospects of the vine are materially\r\nclouded by the _Phylloxera_.\r\n\r\nBut Austria is not beery alone. She has fine exhibits in horology,\r\nelectric and pneumatic telegraphy, and in tools, grain-mills, gang-saw\r\nmills, and machines for making paper bags. More important, as some might\r\nsay, are the admirable locomotives and stationary engines, cars,\r\nfire-engines, and her collection of iron-work, in which are exhibited\r\ncast-iron car-wheels, made by Ganz & Co. of Buda-Pesth, which have been\r\nin use twenty-one years and have run without apparent severe injury a\r\ndistance of 549,108 kilometres, or nearly 280,700 miles.\r\n\r\nThe beet-root sugar interest is becoming very important in Austria, but\r\nthe evidences of the Exhibition indicate that the diffusion-process\r\nholds better credit there than in France, where it is not approved of.\r\nThe rotative apparatus shown is an immense affair, with a series of\r\neight tall tanks arranged on a circular carriage and rotating on a\r\nvertical axis, so as to bring each in turn to the charging and\r\ndischarging positions. Each tank has its own system of pumps. Beet-root\r\nis difficult to exploit for various reasons, chemical and other. Like\r\nthe vine, it is particular in its nutriment, requires great skill to\r\nremove extraneous substances, and can hardly be handled by the French\r\nsystem without a set of machinery costing about eighty thousand dollars.\r\n\r\nFrom Austria to Spain is but a step, but it is not productive of much\r\ninformation in the matter we have in hand. A beaming-machine for cotton\r\nwarps, red, white and yellow, stands solitary in its section, and next\r\nto it is a model of a _cirque de taureau_, composed of nineteen thousand\r\npieces of tin laboriously put together without solder, as if that were a\r\nmerit, and stated to be the work of two years. In the arena the wooden\r\nbull regards with indifference two mounted cavaliers and seven footmen\r\nin various provoking attitudes. Near by are various machines and presses\r\nfor the treatment of grapes and olives, grinders and presses in variety,\r\na sugar-cane press and a turbine. Barcelona would seem to be the most\r\nenterprising of Spanish cities. Several exemplifications of the\r\nexcellent iron of Catalonia and Biscay suggest the direction in which\r\nSpain has taken its most important industrial start of late years. An\r\nadmirable model of the quay of the copper-mining company of the Rio\r\nTinto is another evidence in the same line which the maps, plans and\r\nores amply corroborate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BLAKE STONE-CRUSHER.]\r\n\r\nTwo steps, in violation of all preconceived geographical notions, but in\r\nobedience to the Exposition authorities, land us in China, where we find\r\nthings mechanical in much the same state of progress as Marco Polo\r\nviewed them some centuries since. The silk tissues brought from the far\r\nEast were famous in the days of the Roman magnificence, and here is the\r\nloom. The marvel is how such a web can be made on such a rough machine.\r\nA blue silk warp of delicate threads is in the loom, which has nine\r\nheddles, and the partly-finished fabric shows a woof consisting of a\r\nnarrow gilded strip of paper. The sheen of the figured goods is\r\nsomething remarkable. It is a parallel case to that of the shawls of\r\nKashmir, where the natives, trained for generations, succeed in\r\nproducing by great care and unlimited expenditure of time fabrics with\r\nwhich the utmost elaboration of our machinery scarcely enables us to\r\ncompete.\r\n\r\nThe machine for the whitening of rice by the removal of the brown\r\ncoating from the pure white grain is similar to that shown from Siam at\r\nthe Centennial, but, unlike the latter, the faces of the two round\r\nhorizontal wooden blocks which act as mill-stones are serrated, whereas\r\nthe Siamese rubbers were made of sun-dried clay, the serrations\r\nconsisting of bamboo strips inserted in the clay while yet plastic. The\r\nmotion is similar, not being continuously revolving, but reciprocatory,\r\nand the method is customary in all the rice-eating regions except India,\r\nand is well known in parts of the latter, though not universal. The\r\ngrain of Eastern Asia, including India and Malaysia, is almost\r\nuniversally rice, of which two, and even three, crops a year are raised\r\nin some regions, and the processes of cooking are simple among these\r\nvegetarians, the variation consisting principally in the choice of\r\ncondiments or of certain additional esculents or fruits in their season.\r\nThe grinding of grain is, however, universally known, though meal forms\r\nbut a small proportion of the daily food. The mortar and pestle in the\r\nChinese section show the more usual method, and there, as in some parts\r\nof India, the pestle is placed on the end of a poised horizontal beam\r\nwhich is worked by the foot of the operator at the end opposite to the\r\npestle.\r\n\r\nWe meet in the Chinese section with the original of our fanning-mill or\r\nwinnowing-machine for grain. Though China has had the same machines for\r\ncenturies, we have not knowingly copied many of them. The fanning-mill,\r\nporcelain and the _cheng_ may be fairly credited to her. The last is the\r\noriginal of all our free-reed musical instruments. It is shown here, and\r\nwas also at the Centennial, and it was the carrying of one overland to\r\nRussia, where it fell into the hands of Kratzenstein, the organ-builder\r\nto Queen Catharine II., which initiated the free reed in Europe, and led\r\nto the accordions, concertinas, harmoniums and parlor organs which\r\nperhaps afford the cheapest and loudest music for a given expenditure of\r\nmuscle and wind of anything we have.\r\n\r\nThe spinning and winding machinery of China is simple enough, but so\r\nmuch like that of our great-grandmothers that it does not arrest\r\nparticular attention. It is otherwise with the irrigating-machine, which\r\nin its various modifications produces, by the fruitfulness induced, the\r\nfood of scores of millions in China, India, Syria and Egypt--the cogged\r\nwheel on a vertical axis, with an ox travelling beneath it, and a\r\nhorizontal shaft moved thereby and carrying an endless chain of pots or\r\nbuckets, either hanging from the cord or moving in an inclined chute.\r\n\r\nThe ploughs, harrows, rakes, flails, spades, hoes and forks are of the\r\nusual clumsy description, not to be apprehended by the reader without\r\ncuts, and many of them only reasonably effective even in the mellow soil\r\nrepeatedly stirred and occasionally flooded with water. The seed-drill\r\nfor planting one row, with a share on each side to turn soil on to the\r\ngrain, is an anticipation of some later inventions nearer home. The\r\nthresher is a square frame drawn over the grain--which is spread upon\r\nthe bare ground--and is furnished on its under side with steel blades\r\nwhich not only shell the grain out of the ear, but also reduce the straw\r\ninto chaff, which is desirable, as storing for feed more conveniently.\r\nSouthern nations have but little conception of our use of hay. Grain for\r\nthe man and straw for the beast is the usual division. The ancient Roman\r\n_tribulum_ and the modern Syrian _morej_, were or are similar, and the\r\n\"sharp\" threshing instrument of Isaiah may be seen to-day in the Tunis\r\nexhibit, being a frame of boards with sharp flint spalls inserted into\r\nits under surface.\r\n\r\nWe might linger with profit over the elaborate models of Chinese\r\nmanufactures--sugar, rice, tobacco, paper, etc., showing the stages of\r\ncultivation, manufacture, and packing for transportation and market--but\r\nperhaps it will be as well to slip across the alley and visit the\r\nancient island of Zipango.\r\n\r\nZipango, Nipon, Japon, have one consistent syllabic element, and the\r\nrulers of the country are so desirous that it should take its place\r\namong the civilized nations of the world that they have not shown to any\r\nliberal extent the native machinery, except in the form of models which\r\nattract but little attention, a few machines for winding and measuring\r\nsilk, some curious articles of bamboo and ratan, fishpots and baskets,\r\nand cutlery of native shapes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOOL-GRINDING EMERY-WHEEL.]\r\n\r\nThe exclusiveness which had marked the policy of Japan from time\r\nimmemorial, and which was somewhat roughly intruded upon by Captain\r\nPerry, and subsequently by other explorers and diplomatists, has given\r\nplace to a change which amounts to a revolution. Japan, under the name\r\nof Zipango, took its place on the map of the world some time before\r\nColumbus discovered, unwittingly to himself, that a continent intervened\r\nbetween Western Europe and Eastern Asia. When Columbus made his voyage\r\nin search of Asia, assisted by those very estimable persons Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella, it was on the part of the latter intended as a flank\r\nmovement against the Portuguese, who, consequent upon the discovery of\r\nthe passage of the Cape of Good Hope by Vasco da Gama, had obtained a\r\npatent from the pope for the eastern route to India. The globe of Martin\r\nBehaim at that time depicted Zipango as off the coast of Asia and near\r\nthe longitude actually occupied by the Carolinas and Florida, the\r\neastward extension of Asia being fearfully exaggerated. The globe of\r\nJohn Schoener, of 1520, fourteen years after the death of Columbus, had\r\nZipango in the same place, and Cuba alongside of it, ranging north and\r\nsouth. So loath were geographers to give up preconceived ideas. Columbus\r\ndied supposing he had discovered \"fourteen hundred islands and three\r\nhundred and thirty-three leagues of the coast of Asia,\" and hence our\r\ngroup are called the West Indies, and our aborigines Indians. Such are\r\none's reflections as one wanders in the Japanese section, dreaming among\r\nthe objects of a land which has just awaked from what may be called the\r\nsleep of centuries.\r\n\r\nItaly has much that is valuable as well as beautiful in other classes,\r\nbut her attempts in agricultural machinery are but rude. Here, for\r\nexample, is a plough. Well, perhaps it is not exactly that which made\r\nthe trench over which Remus leaped, to be slain by his twin\r\nwolf-nursling, but it is the plough of Bocchi Gaetano of Parma, is\r\ntwelve feet long and weighs something under half a ton. Another, hard\r\nby, is two feet longer and has but one handle. Efforts are evident,\r\nhowever, to assimilate the country to the portions of Europe more\r\nadvanced in mechanical matters. When we reflect upon how much we owe to\r\nItaly, we can but wish her well, but we cannot delay long with her in a\r\nsearch for objects of mechanical interest except to examine her models\r\nof tunnels, manner of scaffolding, boring and blasting. The Mont Cenis\r\ntunnel must stand as the grandest work of its kind until that of Saint\r\nGothard is finished. An exemplification by a model constructed to a\r\nscale of the electric ballista of Spezzia for testing the hundred-ton\r\ngun lately made in England for Italy attracts a great many visitors, and\r\nthe large photographs which give the condition of the butt after each\r\nimpact of the projectiles brings up again the double problem as it is\r\nstated: How to construct a gun and projectile which shall be able to\r\npierce the heaviest armor; and how to construct armor which shall be\r\nproof against the heaviest shot. Many saw with interest in the Machinery\r\nBuilding at the Centennial the eight-inch armor-plating made by Cammell\r\nof Sheffield, tested in one case by nine spherical shots overlapping,\r\nmaking an indentation of 3.12 inches with balls from a seven-inch gun\r\ndriven by thirty pounds of powder at a range of seventy feet. They are\r\nhere again, and so is the nine-inch armor with a much deeper indentation\r\nfrom a chilled Palisser bolt. Here is also a new-comer, John Brown,\r\nwhose armor of four and a half inches of steel welded on to the same\r\nthickness of iron resists the Palisser bolt, which only penetrates the\r\nthickness of the steel. What might happen to it with a pointed steel\r\nbolt from a sixty- or one-hundred-ton gun is another matter. To set our\r\nminds at rest as to what would occur in the event supposed comes Sir\r\nJoseph Whitworth, who exhibits his gun with polygonal rifling, the bore\r\nbeing a hexagon with rounded corners. The projectiles are moulded of the\r\nsame shape, and are fired as they are cast, without planing. One of\r\nthese bolts, six diameters long and weighing twenty-nine and a half\r\npounds, was fired from a twelve-pounder gun through a four and a half\r\ninch armor-plate. The exhibit also shows a flat-fronted Whitworth\r\nfluid-pressed steel shell, three diameters long, weighing eight hundred\r\nand eight pounds, which was fired at Gavre, France, without a bursting\r\ncharge, from a Whitworth twelve-inch, thirty-five-ton gun, and\r\npenetrated iron sixteen inches thick and twelve inches of oak backing.\r\nThe shell remained entire and was only slightly distorted. The question\r\nseems to be answered, unless the plates are made twenty inches thick,\r\nand that is impossible on a vessel to be manoeuvred.\r\n\r\nSweden comes next, and the scene changes; for the weapon which suggested\r\nthe remarks was only, as it were, one gun in a garden. Instead of wine\r\nand olives we find iron and furs. Except some Indian steels, there is no\r\nbetter metal than that of Sweden, and horse-shoe nails are made of it\r\nall over Europe and the United States. Iron in ore, pig, rails, bars,\r\nrods, wire; iron in tools, files, wheels, balls, shells, pans, boilers,\r\nstoves, springs; iron _ad lib_.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural machines of Sweden, like those of Denmark, are copies\r\nof the American and English, and the same is true to a large extent of\r\nthe engines, saw-mills, water-wheels and wood-working machinery. The\r\nstatement would not be true of the very elaborate exercising-machines\r\n(_la gymnastique medicale mecanique_) invented by Gustave Zander of\r\nStockholm. They embrace every conceivable variety of effort, and also\r\nanother class of applications which may be termed shampooing, as they\r\nconsist of kneading and rubbing. Among the twenty machines are those\r\ndesigned for flexing, stretching and extending the limbs, for kneading\r\nthe back and neck, for rubbing the body and limbs to induce circulation\r\nand simulate the effect of exercise in the cases of weak persons or\r\nthose confined to their beds by casualties. Some of these were in\r\nPhiladelphia in 1876.\r\n\r\nSteering-apparatus and gun-harpoons for whaling testify to the maritime\r\ncharacter of the people, as do the boats and ropes. The great exhibit\r\nof _pate de bois_ shows the anxiety of the people to turn their\r\nextensive forests to good account in the markets of the world. White\r\npine seems to be the principal wood thus used. Norway and Sweden have\r\nbeen shipping timber for some centuries, and yet seem to need no laws to\r\nrestrain the denudation of their hills; certainly not to encourage\r\nrainfall. Bergen has 88.13 inches per annum, which is just double that\r\nof Philadelphia, and four inches greater than that of Sitka, where the\r\npeople say it is always raining. Of course these figures are small when\r\ncompared to spots on the Himalayas, where Hooker observed a fall of 470\r\ninches in seven months, and on one occasion 30 inches in four hours; the\r\nlatter equal to the average annual rainfall of France.\r\n\r\nThe American machinery, which occupies a position between Norway and\r\nEngland, is creditable in kind and quality, but fails very far in giving\r\na correct idea of the multiplicity of our industries. Almost the only\r\nevidence of our textile manufactures are two of Tilt's Jacquard\r\nsilk-weaving looms. The telephones of Edison and Gray excite unremitting\r\nastonishment and admiration, and have both received the highest possible\r\nawards. Our wood-working is practically shown in a large variety by Fay\r\n& Co. of Cincinnati, and one or two other special machines by other\r\nmakers. The Wheelock engine, which drives all the machinery in our\r\nsection of the main building, has very properly been awarded a grand\r\nprize. It is all that can be desired in an engine, and has a singular\r\nsimplicity of construction, with few working parts. It is the same which\r\ndrove the machinery in the Agricultural Building at the Centennial. The\r\nsteam is admitted and exhausted by a valve at each end of the cylinder\r\nplaced directly below the port. The cut-off valve is behind the main\r\nvalve: the mechanism for operating the valves is on the outside of the\r\nsteam-chest, and easily accessible. The valves and seats are made\r\ntapering in their general diameter, and the pressure of steam comes on\r\none side, also acting to keep the collar in contact with the sleeve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWEDDELL'S HYDRAULIC RIVETING-MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe Waltham Watch Company is considered by some of the most influential\r\nEuropean journals as the most important in the American section on\r\naccount of the revolution it is making in that important industry. When\r\nthe Swiss commissioner went home from the Centennial he published a\r\nletter fairly throwing up the sponge, and when the company's exhibit\r\nappeared for the first time in Europe at an international exposition it\r\nwas regarded as carrying the war into Africa. The American system of\r\nmaking by machinery all the parts of an article--say, of a watch--of a\r\ngiven grade by means of gauges and templets, so that the parts may be\r\n\"assembled,\" and of such singular exactitude in their making that any\r\npart may be replaced by the corresponding piece of any other watch of\r\nthe same grade, has in this manufactory attained its highest results,\r\ngreatest precision and most perfect illustration. The whole collection\r\nof watches was sold within a few weeks after the opening. The latest\r\nimprovements in the balance to secure perfect isochronism under varying\r\nconditions of temperature would delight the soul of Harrison, who worked\r\nfrom 1728 to 1761 on the problem of a compensator for the changes of\r\nrate due to the expansion and contraction of the metal, and received the\r\nreward of twenty thousand pounds sterling offered by the Board of\r\nLongitude.\r\n\r\nTiffany's exhibit has been admired and patronized, but is not quite\r\nwithin my range of subjects. Darling, Brown & Sharpe have their\r\nmachine-tools and gauges, Bliss & Williams their presses and dies. We\r\nhave the Baxter, Snyder and Lovegrove portable engines, Taylor's and\r\nAultman's agricultural engines. Our railroad exhibit is not very full:\r\nwe have a Philadelphia and Reading coal-burning locomotive, a Pullman\r\ncar, the Westinghouse brake, Stephenson's street-cars, car-wheels from\r\nBaldwin's and Lobdell's: the latter also sends calender-rolls of\r\nremarkable quality. As a sort of set-off to the Austrian car-wheels\r\nwhich have run for twenty-one years, as previously mentioned, Lobdell\r\nhas a pair which have run 245,000 miles on the Missouri, Iowa and\r\nNebraska Railway. The Fairbanks scales in great variety, both of size\r\nand purpose, and of a finish and an accuracy which have become\r\nproverbial; the Howe scales; the Goodyear boot- and shoe-machinery;\r\nStow's flexible shaft; Lechner's coal-mining engine; Allen & Roeder's\r\nriveting-machine; and Delamater's punches and shears,--are a few more of\r\nthe representative machines.\r\n\r\nSewing-machines are not in as great variety in the American section as\r\nthey were in Philadelphia. There are, however, enough of American and\r\nEuropean to foot up about eighty exhibitors. Wheeler & Wilson's have\r\nbeen awarded the grand prize, and there are various medals for others,\r\nboth home and foreign--the American machine, Cole's and Wardwell's among\r\nthe number. The various hardware exhibits, such as the Disston saws,\r\nAmes shovels, Collins axes, Batcheller forks, Russell & Erwin builders'\r\nhardware, as well as the Remington, Colt, Winchester, Sharpe and Owen\r\nJones rifles and revolvers, and the Gatling and Gardner guns, are a\r\nlittle on one side of my present line of subjects.\r\n\r\nThe United States has preserved its ancient reputation in its\r\nagricultural machinery. We are especially strong in the class which we\r\nterm \"harvesters,\" the name including reapers, automatic binders,\r\nmowers, horse-rakes and hay-loaders. Our baling-presses also are in\r\nadvance of competitors. A juryman may perhaps stand excused for\r\nsupposing that more than an average amount of interest is felt in the\r\nmachinery which happens to be in his class, but on Class\r\n76--\"agricultural implements in motion and in the field\"--additional\r\ninterest was conferred by a series of competitive trials extending from\r\nJuly 22 to August 12, and embracing reapers, mowers, steam and ordinary\r\nploughs, hay-presses, threshing-machines especially, but also including\r\nall the other machines for working in the ground, gathering crops and\r\nthe storage and preparation of feed for animals. In this series of\r\ncompetitive trials eight different countries entered the lists. The\r\nprizes were twelve _objets d'art_ placed at the disposal of Monsieur\r\nTisseraud, the \"director-general of agriculture and horticulture of\r\nFrance,\" and the jury selected to attend the trials. Eleven of them were\r\naccorded to machines of \"exceptional merit,\" the idea of novelty being\r\nincluded in the definition of the term. These _objets d'art_ are Sevres\r\nvases worth one thousand francs each, and in view of their exceptional\r\nvalue, and the large share that America has in the award, a list of the\r\nnames may very properly be appended.[5] Several hundred machines\r\ncompeted: for instance, twenty-six reapers, sixteen mowers, fifty-four\r\nploughs, and so on of numerous kinds of agricultural implements and\r\nmachines for working in the soil, gathering crops and for the work of\r\nthe homestead and barn.\r\n\r\nLast on the foreign side is the British machinery, and the collection is\r\nvery much larger and more varied than any of the preceding. There are\r\nfew lines of manufacture which are not represented here. Machines for\r\nworking in iron and other metals, for sawing and fashioning wood, for\r\nthe ginning, breaking or carding of cotton, flax, wool, jute and hemp,\r\nfor working in stone, glass, leather and paper, are shown. Then, again,\r\nthe finished productions; prime motors, such as stationary engines,\r\nlocomotives and fire-engines; lifting-machines for solids or liquids,\r\ncranes, jacks, elevators, pumps, each in endless variety.\r\n\r\nProminent in the hall, and employed in driving the machinery, is the\r\nlarge double compound horizontal engine of Galloway of Manchester. This\r\nform of engine is coming to the front, as is evinced especially in the\r\nmarine service. Maudslay & Sons of London exhibit a model of the\r\nfour-cylinder marine compound engine as fitted on the \"White Star line\"\r\nvessels, the Germanic, Britannic, Oceanic, Baltic and Adriatic, and on\r\nthe steamers of the \"Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,\" the Ville de\r\nHavre, Europe, France, Amerique, Labrador, Canada. The vessels of the\r\nNew York and Bremen line have the same class of engines, built in\r\nGreenock, Scotland.\r\n\r\nAmid so large a mass of machinery one can but select the most prominent,\r\nand among these we may choose such as, while not necessarily imposing in\r\nsize, are suggestive of ideas which we may find valuable for home\r\nintroduction. Appleby & Sons lead the world in the completeness and\r\ncapacity of their great cranes and lifts for docks and wharves,\r\nmachine-shops, erection of buildings, and travelling cranes for railways\r\nor common roads. We must make one exception--the elevators for hotels\r\nand warehouses, in which America is in advance of all other countries.\r\nWhile we have many varieties of these, we must give credit where it is\r\ndue, and the _ascenseur Edoux_ of Paris is the original of all those in\r\nwhich the cage is placed upon a plunger that descends into a vertical\r\ncylinder into which water is forced to elevate the plunger, and from\r\nwhich it is withdrawn to allow the plunger and cage to descend. Very\r\nfine specimens of this class of elevator are in the New York Post-office\r\nbuilding. The gantry crane of Messrs. Appleby Bros. of London is the\r\nmost complete engine of its kind in the world. It was originally\r\nconstructed for the growing requirements of the docks of the\r\nNorth-eastern Railway Company of England at Middlesborough. The term\r\n\"gantry\" is applied to the movable scaffold or frame, which in this case\r\nrests upon a pair of rails twenty-three feet apart, one of them being\r\nclose to the edge of the quay. The clear height is seventeen and a half\r\nfeet, which allows the uninterrupted passage of locomotives and all\r\nkinds of rolling-stock on each of the two lines of rails which are\r\nspanned by the gantry. The crane is designed for a working load of five\r\ntons, with a maximum radius of twenty-one feet from the centre of the\r\ncrane-post to the plumb-line of the lifting chain, with a capacity for\r\naltering the radius by steam to a minimum of fourteen feet. The crane\r\nhas capacity to (1) lift and lower; (2) turn round completely in either\r\ndirection simultaneously with the lifting and lowering; (3) alter the\r\nradius by raising or lowering the jib-head; (4) travel along the rails\r\nby its own steam-power. All these motions are easily worked by one man,\r\nwho attends to the boiler. The travelling motion is transmitted from the\r\ncrane-engines by suitable gear and shafts to the travelling wheels, and\r\nwarping-drums or capstans are fitted on a countershaft on the inner side\r\nof each frame, which drums can be driven independently of the travelling\r\nwheels for moving trucks into position below the crane as they are\r\nrequired for loading and unloading. Smaller cranes may pass with their\r\nloads below the gantry, and a number of these large cranes may be\r\nassembled so as each to work at the different hatchways of a large\r\nscrew steamer, or two may be associated together for any exceptionally\r\nheavy lift. The value of elevation of the crane is not only in allowing\r\nthe loaded cars to be brought on tracks beneath it, but in giving it\r\ncapacity to work over the sides of large vessels, which when light may\r\nrise twenty feet above the level of the quay, and to load or discharge\r\nfrom trucks on two lines of rails on the land-side of the gantry,\r\noverhead of the trucks on the two lines which run below the gantry.[6]\r\n\r\nBlake's stone-breaker, though only represented by model in the United\r\nStates section, where it belongs, is shown by two English firms; and\r\nthough some Europeans profess to have improved upon its details, no\r\nefficient substitute has been found for it, but it remains the premium\r\nstone-crusher of the world, and has rendered services in the\r\nexploitation of gold quartz and silver ores, and in the crushing of\r\nstones for public works and for concretes, which can hardly be\r\nexaggerated. In testimony taken in the United States in 1872 it was put\r\nin evidence that five hundred and nine machines then in service effected\r\na direct saving over hand-labor of five million five hundred thousand\r\ndollars per annum.\r\n\r\nSteam-pumps are here in force--direct by Tangye and others, and rotary\r\nby both of the Gwynnes, whose name has been so long and is so intimately\r\nassociated with this class of machines.\r\n\r\nThe emery-wheels of Thompson, Sterne & Co. of Glasgow have the same\r\nvariety of form and application usual with us, but the firm claims that\r\nwhile it uses the true corundum emery of Naxos, the American article is\r\nonly a refractory iron ore, which soon loses its sharpness and becomes\r\ninefficient. This is a question of efficiency or of veracity which we\r\nleave to the trade. The machine adapted as a tool-grinder has six\r\nemery-wheels for varying characters of work. Four are assorted for\r\ngauges of different radii, for moulding-irons, etc. One has a square\r\nface for plane-irons, chisels, etc. One is an emery hone to replace the\r\nwater-of-Ayr stone.\r\n\r\nIn examining the English locomotives exhibited two things were apparent:\r\none half of them have adopted the outside cylinders and wrist-pins on\r\nthe drivers, three out of four have comfortable cabs for the engineers.\r\nThese are, as we view them, sensible changes. Outside-cylinder engines\r\nare also coming into extensive use in France. The machine tools shown by\r\nSharp, Stewart & Co. of Manchester are remarkably well made, and their\r\nlocomotive in the same space is an evidence of the efficiency of the\r\ntools.\r\n\r\nThe exhibit of hydraulic-machine tools by Mr. R. H. Tweddell is a very\r\nadmirable one, and shows a multitude of stationary and portable forms in\r\nwhich the idea is developed so as to reach the varying requirements.\r\nWhen work is more conveniently held to the machines, the latter are\r\nadapted to reach it whether presented vertically or horizontally, or\r\nwith one arm inside of it, as with boilers and flue-pipes. When it is\r\nmore convenient to handle the riveter, the latter is suspended from a\r\ncrane and swung up to its work, and the peculiarity of the various sizes\r\nand shapes for different kinds of work is remarkable. The cut shows one\r\nof the latest for riveting girders.\r\n\r\nThe Ingram rotary perfecting press, on which the _Illustrated London\r\nNews_ is worked off, prints from a web of paper of the usual length, and\r\nis claimed as the final triumph in the line of inventors, which is thus\r\nstated in England: Nicholson, Koenig, Applegarth and Cowper, Hoe and\r\nWalter. We should be disposed to add a few names to the list, among\r\nwhich would be Bullock and Campbell. A is the roll of paper, containing\r\na length of, say, two miles; B B the type and impression cylinders for\r\nprinting the inner form; C C calendering rollers to remove the\r\nindentation of the inner form type; D D the outer form type and\r\nimpression cylinders; E E cylinders with a saw-tooth knife and an\r\nindentation respectively to perforate the sheet between the papers; F F\r\nrollers to hold the sheet while the snatching-rollers G G, which run at\r\nan increased speed, break the paper off where it has been indented by E\r\nE. The folder is in duplicate to give time to work, as each only takes\r\nhalf the papers. The vibrating arm H delivers the sheets alternately to\r\nK and J, which are carrying-tapes leading to two folding-machines. If\r\nthe sheets are not required to be folded, the arm H is moved to its\r\nhighest position, and there fixed, without stopping the machine: it then\r\ndelivers the sheets to the roller L, and by means of a blast of air and\r\na flyer they are laid on a table provided for them.\r\n\r\nThe rise of British factory-life and great energy in manufacturing began\r\nwith the invention of the spinning-frame by Arkwright, the power-loom by\r\nCartwright, the spinning-jenny by Hargreaves, and the mule by\r\nCrompton--all within a space of twenty years ending 1785. To these must\r\nbe added the steam-engine by Watt, which made it possible to drive the\r\nmachinery, and the gin by Eli Whitney, which made it possible to get\r\ncotton to spin. Much as iron has loomed up lately, the working of the\r\nvarious fibres--cotton, wool, flax, hemp and jute--constitutes the pet\r\nindustry of her people, and very elaborate and beautiful are the\r\nmachines at the Exposition, especially attractive and less commonly\r\nknown being those for working long or combing wool, flax, hemp and jute.\r\nThe United States is not doing as much as it ought in the working of\r\nthese fibres, and the money which is paid for the purchase of foreign\r\nlinens and fabrics made of other materials than cotton and wool might,\r\nsome economists think, be employed at home in making them. The day will\r\ncome probably, but does not seem to be hastening very fast, when we\r\nshall conclude to make our own linens, as we have within a comparatively\r\nfew years past determined in regard to all the staple varieties of\r\ncarpets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INGRAM'S ROTARY PERFECTING PRINTING-MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most important machines in the Exposition, from the American\r\npoint of view, is the \"double Macarthy roller-gin,\" exhibited by Platt\r\nBrothers & Co. of Oldham, England. It is a curious instance of how\r\nmachines sometimes revert to their original types. The oldest machine\r\nfor ginning cotton is undoubtedly the roller-gin, and it was known in\r\nIndia, China and Malaysia long before Vasco da Gama turned the Cape of\r\nGood Hope and opened the trade of the East to the Portuguese and their\r\nsuccessors. The common roller-gin of Southern Asia was shown at the\r\nCentennial from Hindostan, Java and China, and is exhibited here from\r\nJava. It has a pair of rollers about the size of broomsticks, close\r\ntogether and turning in different directions, which pinch and draw the\r\nfibre through, while the seeds are prevented from passing by the\r\ncloseness of the rollers. Whitney's invention of the saw-gin in 1794\r\nrevolutionized the business and changed the whole domestic aspect of our\r\nSouthern States. In it the fibre is picked from the seed by means of\r\nsaw-teeth projecting through slits in the side of the chamber in which\r\nthe seed-cotton is placed. But the roller-gin has again come upon the\r\nstage, and with the late improvements is likely to become the gin of the\r\nfuture. When the close of our civil war put an end to the \"cotton\r\nfamine,\" as it was called, in Europe, and American cotton resumed its\r\nplace in the market, the export of the East Indian and Egyptian cottons\r\nwould have been immediately suppressed if they had not possessed the\r\nroller-gin in those countries. Ten thousand of the double Macarthy gin\r\nare used in India, and five thousand of the single roller-gin in Egypt.\r\nIt is understood that the saw-gin is used in but a single district in\r\nIndia. While the saw-gin injures any variety of cotton by cutting,\r\ntearing, napping and tangling the fibres, its action upon the long and\r\nfine staple called \"sea island\" is ruinous, and the roller-gin alone is\r\nsuitable for working it. The slow action of the single roller-gin,\r\ncleaning about one hundred and fifty pounds of lint per day, made its\r\ncultivation too expensive, but the double roller-gin will clean nine\r\nhundred pounds in ten hours, or one hundred and twenty pounds an hour of\r\nthe common upland short-staple cotton. It is thought by Southern members\r\nof the United States commission that the introduction of the double\r\nroller-gin into our country would greatly increase the profitableness of\r\nthe culture of cotton, and especially of the \"sea island,\" which is at\r\npresent much neglected, and in the growth of which we need fear no\r\nrivalry. Each roller is made of walrus leather, and rotates in contact\r\nwith a fixed knife, dragging by its rough surface the fibres of cotton\r\nbetween itself and the knife. A grating holds the seed-cotton. Besides\r\nthese parts there are moving knives to which are attached a grid or\r\nseries of fingers. At each elevation of the moving knives, the grids\r\nattached thereto lift the cotton to the elevation of the fixed\r\nknife-edge and of the exposed surface of the rollers: on the descent of\r\neach moving knife the seeds which have become separated from the fibre\r\nare disentangled by the prongs of the moving grid passing between those\r\nof the lower or fixed grid about seven hundred and fifty times per\r\nminute, and are by this rapidity of action flirted out.\r\n\r\nIt would be scarcely fair to neglect altogether the English annex in\r\nwhich all the agricultural implements are exhibited, nor that which\r\ncontains its carriages. So much commercial intercourse, so many journals\r\npublished in the respective countries, have made each pretty well\r\nacquainted with the agricultural machines and methods of the other. The\r\nprincipal difference is in the splendid plant for steam-ploughing\r\nexhibited by Fowler & Son and by Aveling & Porter, and in the great\r\nnumber and variety of the machines and apparatus for preparing food for\r\nanimals--chaff-cutters, oat- and bean-bruisers and crushers,\r\noilcake-grinders, boilers and steamers for feed and mills for rough\r\ngrinding of grain.\r\n\r\nA shed by the annex contains two curious machines for working stone--one\r\na dresser, belonging to Brunton & Triers, which has a large wheel and a\r\nnumber of planetary cutters whose disk edges as they revolve cut the\r\nstone against which they impinge. The other machine, by Weston & Co., is\r\nfor planing stone mouldings. The stone-drills are in the same annex;\r\nalso the Smith and the Hardy brakes, the former of which is the European\r\nrival of the Westinghouse, acting upon the vacuum principle, and already\r\nin possession of so many of the lines in Europe that it proves a serious\r\ncompetitor.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing in the French Exposition excites more surprise in the\r\nminds of those who are conversant with technical matters than the\r\nimmense advance of the French since 1867 in the matter of machinery. The\r\nsimple statement of the names of the exhibitors, their residences and\r\nthe subject-matter occupies a large volume, and the quality and variety\r\nare equal to the quantity.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the web perfecting printing-machine in the\r\nEnglish section, but quite a number are shown in the French department,\r\nthree of them by Marinoni of Paris, one of which prints the journal _La\r\nFrance_, eighteen thousand an hour. It prints, cuts, counts, folds and\r\npiles the papers. Another by the same maker prints twenty thousand an\r\nhour of the _Weekly Dispatch_ (English paper), and counts and piles them\r\nin heaps of one hundred each. A third works on the _Petit Journal_,\r\nprinting forty thousand per hour with two forms. Alauzet & Co. have also\r\na web perfecting press, _a double touche_, for illustrated papers and\r\nbook-printing. This wets, prints, cuts, counts and folds in octavo four\r\nthousand per hour of super-royal size. They also show a double railway\r\ntopographic press, printing in two colors. Vauthier's roller-press is\r\narranged to work on an endless roll of paper or on sheets fed in as\r\nusual, and prints in six colors. Electro shells are secured in position\r\non the respective rollers, which are in horizontal series, and the paper\r\nis conducted by tapes to the rollers in succession. The French section\r\nshows a great variety of polychrome, lithographic and zincographic\r\nprinting-machines, and also a great number of ordinary job and card\r\npresses, the most interest, however, centring in the large number and\r\nvariety of the web perfecting presses for newspapers and for bill-work\r\nwhere long numbers are required.\r\n\r\nFrance has a right to exemplify the Jacquard in its fulness, for it is\r\nhers. The original machine of Vaucanson and that of Jacquard are in the\r\nConservatoire des Arts et Metiers, as well as a long series of\r\nexemplifications of successive improvements. The Grand Maison de Blanc\r\nof Paris has a large one, making an immense linen cloth of damask\r\nfigures, all in white, and representing what I took at first to be an\r\nallegorical picture of all the nations bringing their gifts to the\r\nExposition. I found afterward that it was called _Fees du Dessert_. It\r\nis about three metres wide, and just as long as you please to make it,\r\nbut the pattern is repeated every five metres. The design, on paper, is\r\nhung against the wall, and is twelve by eight metres, all laid off in\r\nsquares of twelve millimetres, and these again into smaller ones exactly\r\na square millimetre in size. The number of small squares on the sheet of\r\npaper is ninety-six million, which represents the number of the\r\nintersections of the warp and woof in the pattern. There are nine\r\nthousand and sixty-six perforated cards in the Jacquard arrangement for\r\nfloating the threads which form the damask pattern, and the whole\r\nmachine stands on a space of about twenty by twelve feet and is eighteen\r\nfeet high. It is worked by one man, without steam-power, the shifting of\r\nthe harness being done by two foot-levers and the shuttle thrown by a\r\npull-cord.\r\n\r\nWe may here observe the looms that weave the marvellously fine silk\r\ngauzes realizing such fanciful Indian names as \"morning mist,\" which\r\npoetically express the lightness of a web that when spread upon the\r\ngrass is not visible unless one stoops down and examines closely. To\r\neven name the various looms here would be to make a list of ribbons,\r\nvelvets, cloths and other tissues. The subsidiary machines for dressing\r\nthe fabrics are here also--for napping, teasling, shearing, stretching\r\nand brushing, for measuring, folding and packing.\r\n\r\nThe other modes of making fabrics shown are a machine for making\r\nfishing-nets of great width, and a number of knitting-machines, from the\r\nstocking-frame of eighty years ago to the small domestic machine, and\r\nthe larger one with nine hundred needles in the circumference and making\r\na circular seamless fabric eighteen inches in diameter. The march of\r\nimprovement is eminently shown here, where an old man is patiently\r\nknitting a flat web of ten inches with a series of five motions between\r\nthe rows of stitches, while just by are the circular machines, whose\r\nmotions are so rapid that the clicks of the needles merge into a whir,\r\nand a man is able to attend to six machines, making one hundred and\r\nthirty pounds of knitted goods per day.\r\n\r\nPassing the large exhibit of machines for the working of fibres\r\npreliminary to the loom--the carding, roving, spinning, reeling and\r\nwarping--and the allied but different machines which make wire-cloths of\r\ndifferent meshes and size, we come to the ropemaking-machines for hemp\r\nand wire, which are shown principally in their products, the\r\nmanufacture taking an amount of room and material which could hardly be\r\nexpected to be efficiently shown in a crowded building where space is\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nThe French plant for boring small shafts to find water or obtain\r\nsections of the strata, and the larger ones for sinking large ones for\r\nmines, are shown by several exhibitors. The annular drills remove\r\ncylindrical sections of the strata from ten to sixty centimetres in\r\ndiameter: the large chisels resemble those described in the Belgian\r\nexhibit, having a diameter of four metres and a weight of twenty-five\r\nthousand kilos.\r\n\r\nThe department of mining has some excellent large models of mining\r\ndistricts, in which the face of the country is represented with the\r\nnatural undulations, the villages, roads, fields and streams, and made\r\nin removal-sections which expose the underlying strata, the galleries,\r\ndrifts and shafts of the subterranean world.\r\n\r\nAn attempt to describe the steam-engines, of such various size, shape,\r\nposition and capacity, would exhaust all the space permissible in a\r\nmagazine article.\r\n\r\nThe wood-working tools of France are excellent, and our manufacturers\r\nmust look well to their laurels. We have as yet the advantage in\r\ncompactness and simplicity, with adjustability and adaptation to varying\r\nclasses of work. The band-saw is claimed as a French invention, and the\r\ncrowds around the workman who saws a roomful of dolls' furniture out of\r\na single block as large as one's fist are as great here as they were at\r\nPhiladelphia. The Blanchard lathe for turning irregular forms is here in\r\na variety of forms. This is an interesting object of study, as\r\nillustrating the usual course of invention, in which a master-hand\r\ngrasps a subject which has been suggested in an incomplete and\r\ncomparatively ineffective manner from time to time by others. De la Hire\r\nand Condamine during the last century described lathes adapted to turn\r\nirregular shapes, and the scoring-machine for ships' blocks invented by\r\nBrunel and made by Maudslay for Chatham dockyard in England, 1802-8,\r\nwas as perfect an exemplification of the idea as the nature of the work\r\nto be done required. Blanchard, however, in 1819 gave the finishing\r\nstroke, and the lathe will bear his name for long years. Inventors of\r\nthree nations attacked the problem, and each aided the result.\r\n\r\nBrickmaking, diamond-cutting; machines for making paper bags, envelopes,\r\ncuffs and collars; distilleries, sugar-mills, with the successive\r\napparatus of vacuum-pans, pumps and centrifugal filters; soap, stearine,\r\nparaffine, wax, candle, candy and chocolate machines and\r\napparatus,--succeed each other, and we next find ourselves in a busy\r\nfactory of cheap jewelry, Exposition souvenirs and medals, chains and\r\ncharms. The leather machinery is deserving of a careful description, but\r\nit would be too technical perhaps, and there is no romance in the\r\nhandling of wet hides, the scraping, currying, stretching and pommelling\r\nwhich even the thickness, prepare the surface and develop the pliability\r\nof the leather. Near this is the boot- and shoe-making, sewing and\r\ncable-screw wire machines, but none for pegging. Sewing-machines, copies\r\nof the various American forms, occupy the end of the hall.\r\n\r\nSeparate buildings around the grounds and on both banks of the Seine\r\ncontain groups of machinery at which we can but glance. Two long\r\npavilions have agricultural machines, and one each is appropriated to\r\nmaterials for railways, to civil engineering, pumps, gas-works, the\r\nforges of Terre Noire, the iron-works of Creusot, the ministry of public\r\nworks, stoves, the government manufacture of tobacco, navigation,\r\nlife-saving apparatus of floats and boats, fire-engines and ceramics.\r\nAdd to these two annexes, each one thousand feet long, containing\r\nlocomotives, cars, street-cars, telegraph-apparatus and many acres of\r\nthe surplus machinery of all classes excluded from the large building\r\nfor want of room, and a person may form some adequate idea of the\r\nimmense extent and variety of this wonderful collection.\r\n\r\n  EDWARD H. KNIGHT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONEL'S SENTENCE: AN ALGERIAN STORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I've known many clever fellows in my time,\" said Paul Dupont, French\r\nsous-lieutenant in the --th of the line, as he sat sipping his coffee in\r\nfront of the Hotel de la Regence at Algiers, \"but by far the cleverest\r\nman I ever met was our old colonel, Henri de Malet. People said he ought\r\nto have been an _avocat_, but that was giving him but half his due, for\r\nI'll be bound he could have outflanked any lawyer that ever wore a gown.\r\nIn his latter days he always went by the name of 'Solomon the Second;'\r\nand if you care to hear how he came by it I'll tell you.\r\n\r\n\"Before he came to us De Malet was military commandant at Oran, and it\r\nwas there that he did one of his best strokes--outgeneralling a\r\ncamel-driver from Tangier, one of those thorough-paced Moorish rascals\r\nof whom the saying goes, 'Two Maltese to a Jew, and three Jews to a\r\nMoor,' Now this Tangerine, when pulled up for some offence or other,\r\nswore that he wasn't Muley the camel-driver at all, but quite another\r\nman; and as his friends all swore the same, and he had managed to alter\r\nhis appearance a bit before he was arrested, he seemed safe to get off.\r\nBut our colonel wasn't to be done in that way. He pretended to dismiss\r\nthe case, and allowed the fellow to get right out into the street as if\r\nall was over; and then he suddenly shouted after him, 'Muley the\r\ncamel-driver, I want to speak to you.' The old rogue, hearing his own\r\nname, turned and came back before he could recollect himself; and so he\r\nwas caught in spite of all his cunning.\r\n\r\n\"The fame of this exploit went abroad like wildfire, and it got to be a\r\nsaying among us, whenever we heard of any very clever trick, that it was\r\n'one of Colonel de Malet's judgments;' and so, when he was transferred\r\nfrom Oran to Algiers, it was just as if we all knew him already,\r\nalthough none of us had ever seen him before. But it wasn't long before\r\nwe got a much better story than that about him; for one night a man\r\ndined at our mess who had known the colonel out in India, and told us a\r\ngrand tale of how he had astonished them all at Pondicherry. It seems\r\nthat some things had been stolen from the officers' quarters, and nobody\r\ncould tell who had done it. The first thing next morning the colonel\r\nwent along the line at early parade, giving each of the native soldiers\r\na small strip of bamboo; and then he said, very solemnly, 'My children,\r\nthere is a guilty man among us, and it has been revealed to me by Brahma\r\nhimself how his guilt is to be made clear. Let every man of you come\r\nforward in his turn and give me his piece of bamboo; and the thief, let\r\nhim do what he may, will have the longest piece.'\r\n\r\n\"Now, you know what superstitious hounds those Asiatic fellows always\r\nare; and when they heard this announcement they all looked at each other\r\nlike children going to be whipped. The colonel took the bamboos one\r\nafter another, as solemnly as if he were on a court-martial, but when\r\nabout a dozen men had gone past he suddenly sprang forward and seized\r\none of them by the throat, shouting at the full pitch of his voice, 'You\r\nare the man!'\r\n\r\n\"Down went the fellow on his knees and yelled for mercy, confessing that\r\nhe _was_ the man, sure enough. As for the rest, they looked as\r\nfrightened as if all the gods in the caverns of Elephanta had come\r\nflying down among them at once; and from that day forth they salaamed to\r\nthe very ground at the mere sight of the colonel half a mile off.\r\n\r\n\"'How on earth did you manage that, colonel?' asked the senior major, a\r\ngreat fat fellow, as stupid as a carp.[7]\r\n\r\n\"'Nothing simpler, my dear fellow,' answered De Malet, laughing. 'The\r\nstrips were all exactly the same length, and the thief, fearing to get\r\nthe longest piece, betrayed himself by _biting off the end_.'\r\n\r\n\"This, as you may think, added a good deal to the colonel's reputation;\r\nand when we had that affair with the Bedouins at Laghouat we soon saw\r\nthat he could fight as well as manoeuvre. In the thick of the skirmish\r\none of the rogues, seeing De Malet left alone, flew at him with drawn\r\nyataghan, but the colonel just dropped on his horse's neck and let the\r\nblow pass over him, and then gave point and ran the fellow right through\r\nthe body, as neatly as any fencing-master could have done it. You may be\r\nsure we thought none the less of him after that; but all this was\r\nnothing to what was coming.\r\n\r\n\"Well, De Malet had been with us about a year when the railway was begun\r\nfrom Algiers to Blidah, and the directing engineer happened to be one of\r\nmy greatest friends, Eugene Latour, as good a fellow as I ever met. It\r\nwas quite a fete with us whenever he dined at mess, for his jokes and\r\ngood stories kept every one brisk; and then to hear him sing! _ma foi_,\r\nit was wonderful! One minute some rattling refrain that seemed to set\r\nthe very chairs dancing, and then suddenly a low, sad air that fairly\r\nbrought the tears into your eyes. They were in mine, I know, every time\r\nI heard him sing those last two verses of 'The Conscript's Farewell:'\r\n\r\n  I thought to gain rich spoils--I've gained\r\n    Of bullets half a score:\r\n  I thought to come back corporal--\r\n    I shall come back no more.\r\n\r\n  Feed my poor dog, I pray thee, Rose,\r\n    And with him gentle be:\r\n  He'll miss his master for a while--\r\n    Adieu! remember me![8]\r\n\r\n\"Well, as I was saying, Eugene had been put over the work, and I don't\r\nknow where they could have found a better man for it. Whether it poured\r\nwith rain or came on hot enough to cook a cutlet without fire, it was\r\nall one to him: there he was at his post, looking after everything,\r\nwith his eyes in ten places at once. You may think that under such a\r\nchief the laborers had no chance of idling; and everything was getting\r\non splendidly when one morning, as he was standing on the parapet of a\r\nbridge, his foot slipped and down he went, I don't know how far. The\r\nfall would have killed him outright if by good luck there hadn't\r\nhappened to be an Arab underneath (the only time that an Arab ever _was_\r\nof any use, I should say), and Eugene, alighting upon _him_, broke his\r\nown fall and the Bedouin's neck to boot.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if there had been nobody there to tell tales, this wouldn't have\r\nmattered a pin, for an Arab more or less is no such great matter; but,\r\nas ill-luck would have it, there were three or four more of the rascals\r\nnear enough to see what had happened, and of course they raised a\r\nhue-and-cry directly. And when it was noised abroad that a Christian dog\r\n(as they politely call us) had killed a Mussulman, you should have seen\r\nwhat an uproar there was! The people came running together like vultures\r\nwhen a camel drops down in the desert, and there was a yelling and\r\ndancing and shaking of fists that made one's very head turn round. Poor\r\nEugene would have been torn to pieces on the spot if the guard hadn't\r\nformed round him and defended him; and the only way we could pacify the\r\nmob was to promise them justice from the district magistrate; so away to\r\nthe magistrate we all went.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I dare say Mr. Magistrate was a very good fellow in his way, and I\r\ndon't want to say a word against him, but still, it must be owned that\r\nhe wasn't exactly the kind of man to stand firm in the midst of a rabble\r\nof wild Mohammedans, all howling and flourishing their knives at once\r\nunder his very nose. To tell the plain truth, he was frightened out of\r\nhis wits; and the only thing _he_ thought of was how to shift the\r\nresponsibility on to somebody else's shoulders as fast as possible. So\r\nhe said (and it was very lucky he did, as it turned out) that Latour,\r\nbeing in government employ, must be tried by military law; and he\r\npacked them all off to the commandant, who, as I've told you, was no\r\nother than Colonel de Malet.\r\n\r\n\"It was no easy matter for the colonel to get at the facts of the case,\r\nfor all the rascals kept shrieking at once, one louder than another; but\r\nat last, bit by bit, he managed to get a pretty clear idea of what had\r\nhappened; and then he said, very solemnly, 'A French officer does his\r\nduty, let it be what it will.

It was like the rush of many waters, the explosion of\r\ncannon--like anything the imagination can conceive; and at the same time\r\nthe earth appeared to leap beneath our feet, then swayed to and fro with\r\nan oscillating motion: the panes of glass rattled in the windows, the\r\nbeams of the flooring above creaked ominously; lamps, chandeliers and\r\ngirandoles vibrated and trembled like animated creatures. The great\r\nbells of the cathedral suddenly rang out a spontaneous peal of alarm\r\nwith a sonorous, awe-inspiring clang, while the clock in the tower\r\nstruck the ill-timed hour with a solemn, unearthly reverberation.\r\n\r\nThis was but the work of a few seconds: a few more and Caracas would\r\nhave been a heap of ruins, as in the earthquake of 1812. But even in\r\nthese short moments we had time, horror-stricken and pallid with terror\r\nas we were, to cry out, \"An earthquake! an earthquake!\"--to seize upon\r\nour European friend, who did not seem to realize the danger, to drag him\r\nfrom the chair which he was just about to take, I pushing him before me,\r\nwhile my sister pulled him by the arm down the long drawing-room into\r\nthe corridor which surrounds the central court, while still the earth\r\nrocked beneath our feet and everything around us trembled with the\r\nvibration.\r\n\r\nBy this time the city was thoroughly alarmed. Cries of \"Misericordia!\r\nmisericordia!\" resounded on every side, and every one prophesied another\r\nand a greater shock. These fears were not entirely uncalled for, for at\r\ntwenty minutes past nine there was a second, and several more before\r\ndaybreak, although none proved to be as severe as the first.\r\n\r\nIn a short time carriages began to roll by in all directions, bearing\r\nthe more timorous to the villages and plantations outside of the city:\r\nthe open public squares or _plazas_ filled rapidly with the excited\r\npopulation, especially when telegram after telegram began to arrive from\r\nLa Guayra, Puerto Cabello, Valencia, La Vittoria and the intervening\r\ntowns--all having felt the violence of the shock, and anxious lest the\r\ncapital might have been destroyed. This proof of the extent of the _onda\r\nseismica_, as the scientists termed it, served to increase the general\r\nalarm. Tents were improvised in the plazas, composed of blankets,\r\ncounterpanes, etc., stretched across ropes attached to the trees in the\r\nsquare, those who had no such appliances at hand remaining all night\r\nupon the public benches or upon more comfortable seats which they caused\r\nto be transported for their accommodation.\r\n\r\nThe scene in the principal square of Caracas, the Plaza Bolivar--upon\r\nwhich front the cathedral on the eastern side, the palace of the\r\narchbishop on the southern, the presidential residence (called the _Casa\r\nAmarilla_, or \"Yellow House\") on the western, and a number of other\r\npublic buildings on the northern--was one which under less terrifying\r\ncircumstances would have been most imposing, for the archbishop left his\r\npalace and descended by the great stairway into the plaza, accompanied\r\nby a train of his attending priests, to raise the fainting spirits of\r\nthe terrified multitude, who, with pallid faces upraised to Heaven or\r\ncrouched upon the bare ground in attitudes of supplication, implored\r\nmercy from on high. And inasmuch as calamitous events, such as the\r\nappearance of comets, earthquakes or pestilences, are usually the\r\nsignal for great moral reforms, doubtless many a promise of a purer life\r\nwas registered in that hour of terror by those self-accused by their\r\nquickened consciences.\r\n\r\nThe archbishop--who is a young man, devout, fervent and sincere, a very\r\nanchorite in his habits and mode of life, thin, spare of frame, and with\r\nfeatures eloquent with the fire of intellect, morally and physically the\r\nsplendid ideal of what a true priest ought to be--wandered among his\r\nflock, exhorting, comforting, admonishing and cheering them; while the\r\n_Hermandades_, a religious brotherhood, headed by their color-bearer,\r\nupon whose banner the effigy of the Virgin, their patron saint, was\r\nemblazoned, walking two by two in procession in the long gowns of their\r\norder--some red, some black, some white--and each carrying a lighted\r\ntaper, traversed the plazas and paraded the streets the whole night. The\r\nglimmering light of the tapers falling upon these dusky shrouded forms\r\nin the gloom of this awful night, the melancholy refrain of the prayers\r\nwhich they chanted as they passed through the awestruck city, the\r\nlessening glimpses of the flickering tapers as the train passed solemnly\r\nby into some distant street,--all served rather to intensify than to\r\ntranquillize the alarm.\r\n\r\nThe excitement and agitation of the people were so great that no one\r\nthought of going to bed: those who, like ourselves, went neither to the\r\ncountry nor to the open squares, sat in their windows and compared their\r\nexperiences or gathered news from every passer-by; for they feared to\r\nseparate from their families, lest a worse shock might overtake some one\r\nof them apart from the rest. Besides this, the danger in the streets was\r\ngreater than at home, because of their narrowness and the likelihood of\r\nthe walls on either side toppling over upon pedestrians.\r\n\r\nThe night had been beautifully clear, and the moon brilliant as it is\r\nonly in the tropics, but toward midnight the weather became cloudy and a\r\ndrizzling rain fell at intervals, driving us within doors between one\r\nand two o'clock, but only to lie down fully dressed upon our beds, with\r\nlights burning and doors left open, so as the more readily to facilitate\r\nour escape if necessary. One or two slight shocks recurred during the\r\nnight, but morning dawned at last, finding us unhurt; and with returning\r\nday our courage too returned, so _darkness_ \"doth make cowards of us\r\nall.\" It was then ascertained that the cathedral had sustained some\r\nslight damage; the image of the Virgin in the church of the Candelaria\r\nhad been thrown to the ground and broken to pieces; and the National\r\nPantheon, the observatory of the new university and other public\r\nbuildings, with many houses, had been injured, but none thrown down and\r\nno lives lost.\r\n\r\nNo one, however, could dwell long in lamentation over these accidents\r\nwhen the news reached us the next morning of the terrible calamity which\r\nhad overtaken the beautiful valley of the Tuy. This valley lies to the\r\nsouth of the city of Caracas, at an elevation of twelve or fifteen\r\nhundred feet above the sea, and is noted for being one of the most\r\nfertile of the many rich agricultural districts in which Venezuela\r\nabounds. The river Tuy, two hundred miles in length and navigable for\r\nabout forty miles, flows through the centre, fertilizing the soil and\r\ncausing it to become the granary of the capital, its abundant crops\r\nusually sufficing, in fact, for the consumption of the whole province.\r\nIndeed, were there more public highways its surplus products might find\r\ntheir way to still more distant portions of the republic. The whole\r\nvalley is studded with towns, villages and plantations: of the former,\r\nthe principal are Ocumare, Charallave, Santa Teresa, Santa Lucia and\r\nCua.\r\n\r\nThe city of Cua was beyond comparison the richest and most flourishing\r\nof all, being situated at the head of the valley, where it opens toward\r\nthe vast _Llanos_ or plains, and being also the emporium of many\r\nextensive districts producing the staples of the country, such as\r\ncoffee, cocoa, sugar and indigo. There too had been transported enormous\r\ntimber from the still virgin forests--timber of the most valuable kind,\r\nwhether for ornament, for building or for dyeing purposes. Nor was the\r\ncity more remarkable for its advantageous situation and the importance\r\nof its commerce than for the refinement of its society. Unlike the\r\ngenerality of inland towns in South America, where the constitution of\r\nsociety is apt to be rather heterogeneous, Cua was the residence of many\r\nof the principal families of the country--gentlemen at the head of\r\nwealthy commercial establishments, or opulent planters owning large\r\nestates in the neighborhood, but making the city their permanent abode.\r\nHence the society was far beyond what might have been imagined as\r\nregards position and general cultivation. Cua, like all Spanish American\r\ntowns, was laid out at right angles, while many of the houses rivalled\r\nthe handsomest in Caracas, and were furnished with equal splendor.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things in this smiling valley when, at the same\r\nmoment precisely at which we in Caracas felt the shock of the\r\nearthquake, all the above-mentioned towns--Ocumare, Santa Lucia,\r\nCharallave, etc.--were shaken to their foundations. The latter\r\nespecially suffered greatly, for not a house was left uninjured or safe\r\nto inhabit, although the occupants had time to escape. But Cua--unhappy\r\nCua!--was utterly destroyed. Without a moment's warning, without a\r\nsingle indication of their impending fate, all the inhabitants were\r\nburied beneath the mass of ruins to which in a few seconds it was\r\nreduced. Perhaps it is not strictly correct to say there had been no\r\nsign. The heat had become so intense between seven and eight o'clock\r\nthat numbers of persons were seated outside of the houses or had betaken\r\nthemselves to the open squares to endeavor to seize a breath of fresh\r\nair, while many of the lower classes were sleeping under the open sky;\r\nto which fact, indeed, they owed their lives. The only habitations which\r\nsurvived the violence of the shock were the huts of the poor, being what\r\nis called _bajareque_, made of posts driven into the earth and otherwise\r\nformed of a species of wild cane tied together and cemented with mud\r\nand straw, these primitive dwellings being usually considered\r\nearthquake-proof.\r\n\r\nBesides the extraordinary heat, a friend of ours, who was riding from\r\nhis plantation into the town, observed another indication of some\r\ndisturbance in the usual processes of Nature. While crossing the river\r\nhe noticed that the fishes were leaping in great numbers out of the\r\nwater, and called the attention of several persons to the fact. They\r\nattributed this, however, to the discomfort occasioned by the intense\r\nheat, for the temperature of the water had increased so much that it had\r\nbecome disagreeable to drink.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman to whom I have alluded, Don Tomas de la G----, describes\r\nthe subterranean noise at Cua during the earthquake as something\r\nterrific, like the discharge of hundreds of cannon, while the earth rose\r\nsimultaneously under his feet. There are two kinds of earthquakes--that\r\nof _trepidacion_, which comes directly from below, with an upward\r\nmotion; the other, _de oscilacion_, where the earth sways to and fro\r\nlike a pendulum, and which is generally less dangerous. Unfortunate Cua\r\nexperienced both: the first shock was one vast upheaval, the whole town\r\nbeing uprooted from its foundations and every house uplifted and\r\noverturned, and before the bewildered population could realize what was\r\nhappening they were buried beneath the ruins. The shock then changed\r\ninto the oscillatory movement, and set all this mass of destruction to\r\nquivering as if it were the dire agony of some living creature. All was\r\nso sudden that few were saved by their own exertions, those who survived\r\nhaving either been dug out of the ruins afterward or cast forth by the\r\ncounter-motion as the earth rocked to and fro in the second shock. It\r\nwas as if the city had been lifted up _en masse_, and then thrown back\r\nwith the foundations uppermost--upside down, in fact. Don Tomas de la\r\nG---- happened to be in the plaza in front of the church when the shock\r\ncame: in the endeavor to steady himself he grasped a tree close by; the\r\ntree was uprooted, throwing him violently forward; then suddenly\r\nreversing its course in an exactly opposite direction, it flung him off\r\nto a great distance, bruising him severely. While clinging to the tree\r\nhe beheld the church in front of him, a new and handsome edifice,\r\nliterally lifted up bodily into the air and then overturned with an\r\nappalling crash, \"not one stone left upon another.\" If this had occurred\r\nan hour or two previously, hundreds would have perished within the\r\nwalls, for there had been religious services in the church until a late\r\nhour, it being the Friday before Holy Week, termed by Spanish Catholics\r\n_Viernes del Concilio_.\r\n\r\nDon Tomas de la G---- described the whole scene as something too\r\nterrible for the imagination to conceive. After the stupendous crash\r\ncaused by the falling of the houses, for a few moments there ensued an\r\nawful silence: then, amid the impenetrable darkness caused by the cloud\r\nof dust from the fallen walls, which totally obscured the murky light of\r\na clouded moon, there arose a cry of anguish from those without--a wail\r\nas of one great voice of stricken humanity; then the answering smothered\r\ngroan of those buried beneath the ruins--a cry like nothing human,\r\nrising as it did from the very bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\nThere ensued a scene the harrowing details of which can never be fully\r\ngiven--the search of the living and uninjured for those dead, dying or\r\nimprisoned ones who lay beneath the great masses of stone and mortar.\r\nSometimes, in answer to the desperate cries of those outside or already\r\nrescued, smothered, almost inaudible cries for help might be heard, so\r\nfaint as to seem scarcely human, and yet growing fainter and fainter\r\nstill, until those who were working for the release of the captive\r\nbecame aware that their labor was in vain, and that only a corpse lay\r\nbeneath their feet. No light could be obtained in this stifling Erebus\r\nof dust and darkness: all means of obtaining light had been buried in\r\nthe undistinguishable mass, and where lighted lamps were overturned in\r\nthe crash they had set fire to beams and rafters in the houses, and\r\nmany who escaped being crushed were burned to death. Even proper\r\ninstruments were wanting, and the number of persons who had collected to\r\nassist in the work of searching the debris was totally inadequate to the\r\noccasion. Many instances of distress I can vouch for as authentic, as\r\nthe victims were intimate friends of my own, and all the individuals I\r\nam about to mention were persons of the highest respectability, the\r\nupper classes having suffered more than the lower, who, living in huts\r\nsuch as I have described, were generally uninjured.\r\n\r\nOne of the richest commercial houses in Cua was owned by three German\r\ngentlemen, brothers. The eldest, having married a Spanish American lady\r\nof the place, had lately built himself a magnificent mansion, and one of\r\nhis brothers resided with him. The lady was seated between her\r\nbrother-in-law and husband when the shock came: a huge beam from the\r\nceiling fell across her brother-in-law and literally divided him in two,\r\nwhile the side wall, falling at the same time, buried her husband from\r\nher sight. She herself was saved by the great packages of hemp and\r\ntobacco which fell around her and prevented the wall from crushing her.\r\nBlinded by the darkness and choked by the dust, she yet managed with the\r\nonly hand at liberty to tear an opening which allowed her to breathe,\r\nand through which she called for help. Faint accents answered her: they\r\nwere the tones of her husband's failing voice. She called to him to have\r\ncourage--that she had hopes of release. \"No,\" he replied, \"I am dying,\r\nbut do not give way. Live for our child's sake.\" As well as her\r\nagitation and distress would permit she endeavored to sustain him with\r\nwords of encouragement, but in vain. About fifteen minutes passed in\r\nthis sad colloquy: the replies came more and more slowly, more and more\r\npainfully, and then they ceased: the imprisoned lady comprehended in her\r\nlonely agony that she was a widow. She, a living, breathing woman, fully\r\nconscious of her awful anguish, lay helpless between the stiff and stark\r\ncorpses of her husband and brother-in-law, and quite ignorant of the\r\nfate of her infant child, which had been left in another part of the\r\nhouse. Her cries were heard at last by a muleteer, who made some efforts\r\nto release her, but alone and in the darkness he could accomplish\r\nlittle. He went in search of aid, but his companions, after he had\r\nreturned to the house, refused to endanger their lives, as the shocks\r\nwere incessant and a high wall still standing threatened to topple over\r\nupon them at any moment. They even endeavored to dissuade the muleteer\r\nfrom any further effort, but the good creature replied that he was\r\nindebted to the imprisoned lady for many kindnesses, and that he was\r\nwilling to risk his life in her behalf. One or two remained with him,\r\nand they succeeded at last in releasing her, but were obliged to cut her\r\nclothes from her body, as they seemed immovably nailed to the floor, the\r\nGood Samaritan of a muleteer covering her with his own cloak. The bodies\r\nof her husband, brother-in-law, two clerks and several servants were\r\nrecovered the next day and buried.\r\n\r\nAnother lady was found, when the ruins of her house were cleared away,\r\nupon her knees, with her children surrounding her in the same\r\nattitude--all dead! Their bodies were uninjured, so that it is probable\r\nthat they were suffocated by the dust of the falling walls. A gentleman\r\nnamed Benitez, who had been standing at the door of his house, ran into\r\nthe centre of the street and fell upon his knees: a little boy from the\r\nopposite doorway rushed in his terror into Benitez's arms. At that\r\nmoment the two houses fell, and in this attitude the bodies of the man\r\nand the child were found the following day. A bride of twenty-four hours\r\nwas killed with three of her children by a previous marriage. A fourth\r\nchild was supposed also to have been killed, but on the third day a\r\nsoldier who was passing the house pierced a basket which was among the\r\nruins with his bayonet out of curiosity, when to his amazement a\r\nchildish voice cried out, \"_Tengo hambre_\" (\"I am hungry\"), and the\r\nbasket being lifted a living child was discovered, thus almost\r\nmiraculously saved.\r\n\r\nOne lady was crushed to death under the weight of the body of her\r\ndaughter, who could not move a limb, although she knew her mother was\r\ndying beneath her. A beam had fallen transversely across the daughter,\r\nand in this position she crouched, listening in agony to the\r\ndeath-struggles of her parent. More, almost, than the bitterness of\r\ndeath itself must have been the horror of such a situation and the\r\nterrible contact during long hours of silent darkness with a cold, rigid\r\ncorpse. This lady belonged to the family of Fonseca-Acosta, one of the\r\nmost distinguished in Cua, its head being the eminent physician Dr.\r\nAcosta, now of Paris, one of the favored circle of the ex-queen Isabella\r\nof Spain, with his wife, who was Miss Carroll, a sister of the present\r\ngovernor of Maryland.\r\n\r\nThe Acosta family suffered perhaps more than any other, no less than\r\nfourteen of its members having perished, among them Dona Rosa, a still\r\nyoung and remarkably handsome woman, with her son, a lad of fifteen, and\r\nher baby grandchild. It was to save the life of this grandchild that\r\nDona Rosa forfeited her own, as she ran into the house to snatch it from\r\nits cradle. Of the same family two little boys had fallen asleep at\r\ntheir play: one lay upon a sofa, and the other had crept beneath it. The\r\nearthquake literally turned the room upside down, the sofa being\r\noverturned by the falling wall, the child beneath thrown out and killed\r\nby the descending rafters, while the boy who had been sleeping upon it\r\nfell beneath the lounge, and, being thus protected, actually remained in\r\nthis position uninjured for the greater part of two days. He had been\r\nnumbered with the many dead in that house of sorrow, and was only found\r\nwhen the mourning survivors were searching for his remains to inter\r\nthem--alive, but insensible, and entirely unable to give any account of\r\nwhat had befallen him.\r\n\r\nEvery member of the police force, twenty-five in number, was killed,\r\ntogether with nine prisoners under guard.\r\n\r\nBut it is impossible to give an adequate description of that night of\r\nhorror in Cua by enumerating individual instances of suffering. Those\r\nthat I have given are merely a few out of hundreds of others equally\r\ndistressing.\r\n\r\nThe survivors encamped upon the banks of the river Tuy, where they might\r\nwell repeat those tender lines of the Psalmist: \"By the waters of\r\nBabylon we sat down and wept.\" Even the discomfort of the heavy rains\r\nwhich set in could make no impression upon hearts bowed down and crushed\r\nby the terrible calamity which had swept away their all--home, friends,\r\neverything that makes life worth having--at one quick blow. Not a house\r\nwas left standing in their beautiful city: even the outlines of the\r\nstreets were no longer visible: it was with the greatest difficulty that\r\nany particular building or locality could be recognized.\r\n\r\nTents of various materials were improvised upon the river-side,\r\nsheltering without regard to age, sex or social condition the wounded,\r\nand even the dead. Many were in a state of delirium, some in the agonies\r\nof death, hundreds weeping for their lost friends and relatives, and\r\nmany unable to recognize the recovered bodies on account of their having\r\nbeen burned beyond recognition by the fire caused by the upsetting of\r\npetroleum lamps. For the first two days the bodies were buried in the\r\nusual manner, but on the third decomposition had set in to such an\r\nextent that it was found necessary to burn them. An eye-witness\r\nexclaims: \"Of all that I have seen in what was the rich, the beautiful,\r\nthe flourishing city of Cua, now a cemetery, nothing has made so\r\nprofoundly melancholy an impression upon me as the cremation of the\r\nbodies of the unfortunate victims of the late disaster, tied together\r\nwith ropes and dragged forth from the ruins, one over another, the\r\nstiffened limbs taking strange, unnatural attitudes, and upon being\r\ntouched by the flames consuming instantly, on account of their advanced\r\ndecomposition.\" The body of a little child was thrown upon this funeral\r\npile, when suddenly the eyes opened, and the voice cried out, \"_Pan!\r\npan!_\" (\"Bread! bread!\") Imagine the feelings of the spectators at\r\nbeholding how nearly the little creature had been immolated!\r\n\r\nThe explosion and principal strength of the subterranean forces were\r\nconcentrated in the town of Cua and within a radius of four or five\r\nleagues (twelve or fifteen miles) around it. Within this distance great\r\nchasms of various widths had opened, all running from east to west. From\r\nsome of these streams of a fetid liquid issued, intermingled with a\r\ngrayish-tinted earth, which caused many persons to surmise that a\r\nvolcano was about to burst forth, especially as the earthquake-shocks\r\nstill continued for many days, accompanied by loud subterranean reports.\r\nAlthough the catastrophe was confined to the valley of the Tuy, the\r\nshocks were felt for many hundred miles in every direction, even as far\r\nas Barquesimeto and other places toward the Cordilleras.\r\n\r\nAs the population of Cua had entirely deserted the city and encamped\r\nupon the river-side, and as large sums of money and other valuables were\r\nknown to be buried beneath the ruins, some heartless, lawless wretches\r\ntook advantage of the unprotected state of things, under pretence of\r\nassisting in the work of extricating the victims, to appropriate\r\neverything that they could secrete without being discovered. Only one of\r\nthe public officials, General E----, had escaped: the police had\r\nperished. It was a situation where only prompt and stringent measures\r\ncould avail. General E----, therefore, with Don Tomas de la G----, whom\r\nI have before mentioned, assumed the responsibility of issuing a most\r\nenergetic order of the day, and Don Tomas was commissioned by the\r\ngeneral to draw up the document. In relating the anecdote to me, Don\r\nTomas avers that the order had to be drawn upon the back of a letter\r\nwhich he discovered in his pocket, and that great delay was caused by\r\nits being an impossibility to procure ink. A poor black woman, however,\r\nhearing of his perplexity, announced that her son had been learning to\r\nwrite, and that as her _rancho_ or hut was still standing, the bottle\r\nof ink would probably be found tied to a nail in the wall, as well as\r\nthe pen; that is, provided the thieves had not made away with it, of\r\nwhich she appeared to be somewhat suspicious. She consented to go for\r\nthe articles herself, stipulating, however, that Don Tomas and one or\r\ntwo others should accompany her, believing, apparently, that numbers\r\nwould guarantee her against injury from the earthquake. The ink was\r\nfound where she had described it, but, unfortunately, no pen. Here was\r\nanother dilemma! She bethought herself at last that a neighbor of hers\r\npossessed a pen; so the party was obliged to retrace its steps to the\r\nencampment for further information. The neighbor was sufficiently\r\ngenerous to lend the pen, but stoutly refused to re-enter the stricken\r\ncity. She described its _locale_, however, as being between a rafter and\r\na _cana_ in the roof at the entrance of her hut. The thieves, it proved\r\nupon investigation, had spared the precious implement, although,\r\nprobably, if they had surmised the use to which it was to be put, that\r\nof fulminating destruction to their machinations, they might not have\r\nbeen so honest. All difficulties having been at length overcome, the\r\nimportant document was drawn up, and duly published the following\r\nmorning by _bando_--that is, by sound of the trumpet, drum and fife--a\r\nbody of citizens doing duty in lieu of troops, and the individual with\r\nthe most stentorian lungs thundering forth the edict from where the\r\ncorner of the streets might have been supposed to be. The proclamation\r\nwas to the effect that any person or persons discovered robbing houses\r\nor insulting females should be shot on the spot, without trial or\r\nbenefit of clergy. This measure of lynch law had the desired effect, and\r\nproved sufficient to maintain order until the arrival of a corps of\r\nthree hundred soldiers sent by the government for that purpose.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the disaster was made known, General Alcantara, the president\r\nof the republic, sent carts laden with provisions, blankets, shoes,\r\nhats, etc., besides money, and coaches to convey the unfortunate Cuans\r\nto their friends in the adjacent towns. The president also recommended\r\nthe unfortunate people of Cua to the generosity of Congress, which was\r\nthen in session. A sum of one hundred thousand dollars for rebuilding\r\nthe city was immediately voted--a large sum for so impoverished a\r\nnation--and subscriptions from neighboring states, as well as private\r\nones, have been most liberal. But these are but a drop in the bucket.\r\nSome of the finest plantations in the country surrounded Cua--coffee,\r\nsugar, cocoa, indigo, etc.--all with handsome mansions and expensive\r\noffices, with stores, sugar-mills and steam-engines, many of them worth\r\nfrom fifty to a hundred thousand dollars. After the disastrous 12th no\r\none for many miles in the vicinity slept under roof, but all encamped on\r\nthe adjacent plains: not even the rainy season, which soon set in with\r\ngreat violence, sufficed to drive them from their hastily-contrived\r\nshelter. From the 12th of April to the 30th there were ninety-eight or\r\nninety-nine shocks of earthquake.\r\n\r\nIn Caracas too the people still continued to sleep in the public\r\nsquares, although the capital had hitherto escaped the greatest violence\r\nof the shocks. Various rumors among the most ignorant part of the\r\npopulation, however, still kept up the general excitement. A certain\r\nastronomer or professor of the occult sciences, a Dr. Briceno by name,\r\nhad even the audacity to circulate a paper throughout the city, headed\r\nby the ominous title, \"_Vigilemos!_\" (_Let us watch!_). He prophesied\r\nthat on the 17th of April, at twenty-nine minutes past one, there would\r\ncertainly occur a great _cataclismo_, connecting the movements of the\r\nmoon with the occurrence of earthquakes, and assuring the populace that\r\nat that hour this heavenly body would be in the precise position to\r\nproduce this extraordinary _cataclismo_, whatever that might prove to\r\nbe. The public excitement was intense, but the fatal day and hour\r\narrived, passed, and found the city still safe and unharmed.\r\n\r\n  ISABELLA ANDERSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR MONTHLY GOSSIP.\r\n\r\nTHE HISS AND ITS HISTORY.\r\n\r\n     \"I warrant thee, if I do not act it, they will hiss me.\"--_Merry\r\n     Wives of Windsor._\r\n\r\n\r\nHissing is a custom of great antiquity. Cicero, in his _Paradoxes_, says\r\nthat \"if an actor lose the measure of a passage in the slightest degree,\r\nor make the line he utters a syllable too short or too long by his\r\ndeclamation, he is instantly hissed off the stage.\" Nor was hissing\r\nconfined to the theatre, for in one of his letters Cicero refers to\r\nHortensius as an orator who attained old age without once incurring the\r\ndisgrace of being hissed. Pliny notes that some of the lawyers of his\r\nday had paid applauders in court, who greeted the points of their\r\npatron's speech with an _ululatus_, or shrill yell. This Roman manner of\r\ndenoting approval seems akin to the practice of the Japanese, who give a\r\nwild shriek as a sign of approbation, and hoot and howl to show their\r\ndispleasure. But the sound of the goose--the simple hiss--is the most\r\nfrequently-employed symbol of dissent. \"Goose\" is, in theatrical\r\nparlance, to hiss; and Dutton Cook, in his entertaining _Book of the\r\nPlay_, remarks that the bird which saved the Capitol has ruined many a\r\ndrama.\r\n\r\nThe dramatist is of all creative artists the most unfortunate. He can\r\nnever present himself directly to his critics; he must be seen through a\r\nmedium over which he has but slight control; he must depend wholly on\r\nthe actors of his play, and too often he is leaning on a reed. Colman\r\naccused John Kemble of having been the cause of the original failure of\r\n_The Iron Chest_, and Ben Jonson published his _New Inn_ as a comedy\r\n\"never acted, but most negligently played by some of the king's\r\nservants, and more squeamishly beheld and censured by others, the king's\r\nsubjects, 1629; and now, at last, set at liberty to the readers, His\r\nMajesty's servants and subjects, to be judged of, 1631.\"\r\n\r\nNor are Colman and Jonson alone in their tribulations. Sheridan was\r\nhissed, and so were Goldsmith and Fielding and Coleridge and Godwin and\r\nBeaumarchais and About and Victor Hugo and Scribe and Sardou, and many\r\nanother, including Charles Lamb, who cheerfully hissed his own _Mr. H_.\r\n\r\nThe operatic composer is even more unfortunate than the dramatist, for\r\nhe is dependent not only on the acting but on the singing of his\r\ncharacters; and he is also at the mercy of the orchestra. Wagner's\r\n_Tannhaeuser_ led a stormy life at the Paris opera for a very few\r\nevenings, and its failure the composer has never been willing to let the\r\nworld forget. Rossini was more philosophical. On its first performance\r\nthe _Barber of Seville_, like the comedy of Beaumarchais, whence its\r\nlibretto is taken, was a failure; and when the curtain fell, Rossini,\r\nwho had led the orchestra, turned to the audience and calmly clapped his\r\nhands. The anger at this openly-expressed contempt for public opinion\r\ndid not prevent the opera from gradually gaining ground, until by the\r\nend of the week it was a marked success. Had it been a failure, the\r\ncomposer would have borne it easily: Mr. Edwards informs us that when\r\nRossini's _Sigismondo_ was violently hissed at Venice he sent a letter\r\nto his mother with a picture of a large _fiasco_ (bottle). His _Torvaldo\r\ne Dorliska_, which was brought out soon afterward, was also hissed, but\r\nnot so much. This time Rossini sent his mother a picture of a\r\n_fiaschetto_ (little bottle).\r\n\r\nNor is it, in modern times, authors or actors alone who are subject to\r\nthe hiss. The orator may provoke it by a bold speech in support of an\r\nunpopular measure or an unpopular man. But here the hisser is not so\r\nsafe, nor the hissee--to coin a convenient word--so defenceless. The\r\norator is not hampered by the studied words of a written part: he has\r\nthe right of free speech, and he may retort upon his sibilant\r\nsurrounders. Macready records that on one occasion, when Sheil was\r\nhissed, he \"extorted the applause of his assailants by observing to\r\nthem, 'You may hiss, but you cannot sting.'\" Even finer was the retort\r\nof Coleridge under similar circumstances: \"When a cold stream of truth\r\nis poured on red-hot prejudices, no wonder they hiss.\"\r\n\r\nSir William Knighton declares that George II. never entered a theatre\r\nsave in fear and trembling from dread of hearing a single hiss, which,\r\nthough it were at once drowned in tumultuous applause, he would lie\r\nawake all night thinking about, entirely forgetful of the enthusiasm it\r\nhad evoked. He must have felt as Charles Lamb did, who wrote: \"A hundred\r\nhisses (hang the word! I write it like kisses--how different!)--a\r\nhundred hisses outweigh a thousand claps. The former come more directly\r\nfrom the heart.\" It is hard to entirely agree with Lamb here. Hissing\r\nseems to me to proceed for the most part from ill-temper, or at least\r\nfrom the dissatisfaction of the head. Applause is often the outburst of\r\nthe heart, the gush of a feeling, an enthusiasm incapable of restraint.\r\nNo wonder that the retired actor longs for a sniff of the footlights and\r\nfor the echo of the reverberating plaudits to the accompaniment of which\r\nhe formerly bowed himself off.\r\n\r\nIndeed, applause is the breath of an actor's nostrils. Without it good\r\nacting is almost impossible. Actors, like other artists, need\r\nencouragement. Applause gives heart, and, as Mrs. Siddons said, \"better\r\nstill--breath.\" Mrs. Siddons's niece has put on record her views, as\r\nvaluable as her famous relative's: \"'Tis amazing how much an audience\r\nloses by this species of hanging back, even when the silence proceeds\r\nfrom unwillingness to interrupt a good performance: though in reality it\r\nis the greatest compliment an actor can receive, yet he is deprived by\r\nthat very stillness of half his power. Excitement is reciprocal between\r\nthe performer and the audience: he creates it in them, and receives it\r\nback again from them.\"\r\n\r\nTo one set of actors a hiss takes the place of applause. It is the\r\nhighest compliment which can be paid to a \"heavy villain,\" for it bears\r\nwitness to the truth with which he has sustained his character.\r\n\r\nSometimes the performer mistakes reproof for approval. An amateur\r\nsinger, describing to her father the great success she had achieved at\r\nher first concert, concluded by saying, \"Some Italians even took me for\r\nPasta.\"--\"Yes,\" corroborated her mother: \"before she had sung her second\r\nsong they all cried, 'Basta! basta!'\" (\"Enough! enough!\")\r\n\r\nPasta herself is the heroine of an amusing anecdote. She gave her\r\nservant, a simple _contadina_, an order for the opera on a night when\r\nshe appeared in one of her greatest parts. That evening the great prima\r\ndonna surpassed herself; she was recalled time and again; the audience\r\nwere wildly enthusiastic; almost every number was encored. Returning\r\nhome, she wearily asked her maid how she had enjoyed the play. \"Well,\r\nthe play, ma'am, was fine, but I felt sorry for _you_,\" was the\r\nreply.--\"For me, child! And why?\"--\"Well, ma'am,\" said the waiting-maid,\r\n\"you did everything so badly that the people were always shouting and\r\nstorming at you, and making you do it all over again.\"\r\n\r\nThere are situations even worse than Pasta's, as Pauline Lucca has\r\nrecently discovered in Vienna, where she was fined fifty florins for\r\nviolating the law which forbids the recognition of applause. It seems\r\ncruel to mulct a pretty prima donna for condescending to acknowledge an\r\nencore.\r\n\r\nWhether or not it be law in Austria to prevent a courtesy and a smile,\r\nrewarding the enthusiasm of an audience, it is certainly law in England\r\nand France that a dissatisfied spectator shall be at liberty to express\r\nhis dissatisfaction. It has been held by the Court of Queen's Bench\r\nthat, while any conspiracy against an actor or author is of course\r\nillegal, yet the audience have a lawful right to express their feelings\r\nat the performance either by applause or by hisses. The Cour de\r\nCassation of France has decided in the same way. When Forrest,\r\ntherefore, hissed Macready for introducing a fancy dance in _Hamlet_, he\r\nwas doing what he had a legal right to do, though the ultimate result\r\nof it was the Astor Place riot and the death of many. In ancient Rome\r\nthe right to hiss seems also to have existed in its fulness. Suetonius\r\nin his life of Augustus informs us that Pylades was banished not only\r\nfrom Rome, but from Italy, for having pointed with his finger at a\r\nspectator by whom he was hissed, and turning the eyes of the whole\r\naudience upon him. But as time passed on, and Nero took the imperial\r\ncrown and chose to exhibit it himself to the public on the stage, all\r\nthe spectators were bound to applaud under penalty of death.\r\n\r\nThe French law forbids disturbance of any kind except when the curtain\r\nis up. In France the boisterousness of the Dublin gallery-boy would\r\nhardly be tolerated. The Parisians would have been amazed at a recent\r\nincident of the Irish stage. When Sophocles' tragedy of _Antigone_ was\r\nproduced at the Theatre Royal with Mendelssohn's music, the gallery\r\n\"gods\" were greatly pleased, and, according to their custom, demanded a\r\nsight of the author. \"Bring out Sapherclaze,\" they yelled. The manager\r\nexplained that Sophocles had been dead two thousand years and more, and\r\ncould not well come. Thereat a small voice shouted from the gallery,\r\n\"Then chuck us out his mummy.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a delicious tradition that Mrs. Siddons, when playing in\r\nDublin, was once interrupted with cries for \"Garry Owen! Garry Owen!\"\r\nShe did not heed for some time, but, bewildered at last and anxious to\r\nconciliate, she advanced to the footlights and with tragic solemnity\r\nasked, \"What is Garry Owen? Is it anything I can do for you?\"\r\n\r\nActors are not always willing to stand baiting quietly: they turn and\r\nrend their tormentors. Mrs. Siddons herself took leave of a barbarian\r\naudience with the words, \"Farewell, ye brutes!\" George Frederick Cooke,\r\ndescribing his own failings, said: \"On Monday I was drunk, and appeared,\r\nbut they didn't like that and hissed me. On Wednesday I was drunk, so I\r\ndidn't appear; and they didn't like that. What the devil would they\r\nhave?\" Once at Liverpool, when he was drunk and did appear, they didn't\r\nlike it. He reeled across the stage and was greeted by a storm of\r\nhisses. With savage grandeur he turned on them: \"What! do you hiss\r\nme--me, George Frederick Cooke? You contemptible money-getters, you\r\nshall never again have the honor of hissing me. Farewell! I banish you!\"\r\nHe paused, and then added, with contemptuous emphasis, \"There is not a\r\nbrick in your dirty town but is cemented by the blood of a negro.\"\r\nEdmund Kean treated one of his audiences with less vigor, but with equal\r\ncontempt. The spectators were noisy and insulting, but they called him\r\nout at the end of the piece. \"What do you want?\" he asked.--\"You! you!\"\r\nwas the reply.--\"Well, here I am!\" continuing after a pause, with\r\ncharacteristic insolence: \"I have acted in every theatre in the United\r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, I have acted in all the principal\r\ntheatres throughout the United States of America, but in my life I never\r\nacted to such a set of ignorant, unmitigated brutes as I now see before\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n  J. B. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA NEW TOPIC OF CONVERSATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but what the increase of interest in the\r\ndecorative arts has lightened the general tone of society in our cities.\r\n\"I buy everything new that I can find,\" a lady remarked the other day\r\nwhen her bric-a-brac was praised: \"not that I care anything in especial\r\nfor this sort of thing, but because it is such a blessing to have\r\nsomething to talk about.\" One shudders now to remember the drawing-rooms\r\nof a generation ago--a colorless, cold, negative background for social\r\nlife; rich sweeping curtains of damask satin and lace muffling the\r\nwindows; impossible sofas and impracticable chairs gilded and elaborated\r\ninto the most costly hideousness; an entire suite of rooms utterly\r\nbarren of interest; a place given over to the taste of the upholsterer;\r\nnothing on any hand which contained a suggestion of life or emotion,\r\nthought or effort; every sign of occupation banished--nothing tolerated\r\nsave the dullest uniformity, which depressed originality into inanity.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that this barrenness of household resource had its effect upon\r\nwomen, and that every one complained of the meagre results of ordinary\r\nsocial intercourse. Now-a-days, when tables are crowded with\r\nbric-a-brac, cabinets laden with porcelain and faience, and richly-hung\r\nwalls brightened with plaques and good pictures, the female mind has\r\nreceived a fresh impulse, almost an inspiration, which will show clear\r\nresults before many years have passed.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm for bric-a-brac and pottery, for embroidery and general\r\ndecorative art, is strongest among practical and unimaginative\r\npeople--people who know little or nothing of the world of thought opened\r\nby books, and who have hitherto been somewhat disheartened by a\r\nconviction of their own dulness. To them the present mania is an\r\nundoubted lease of the finer uses of intellect, and their mental\r\nhorizons have widened until the prose of their lives is brightened into\r\npoetry. Every one now-a-days feels the stirring of the artistic impulse,\r\nand is able in some way to gratify it.\r\n\r\nThe American mind is always extravagant, and is certain to aim at too\r\nmuch and leap too high, and in this renaissance of decorative art carry\r\nits admiration of the beautiful and rare entirely too far in one\r\ndirection--in the matter of dress at least. The costly velvets and\r\nsatins and silks, which outweigh and surpass in beauty those of the\r\nearly centuries, are seen on every side cut up and tortured into\r\nintricate and perplexing fashions of toilette. In the olden times these\r\nfabrics were wisely considered too rich to be altered from one\r\ngeneration to another, but were passed from mother to daughter as an\r\ninheritance. So far as the ornamentation of her own person is concerned,\r\nthe American woman is too expensive and prodigal in her ideas, and\r\nwastes on the fashion of the hour what ought to grace a lifetime.\r\n\r\nBut in turning her talent to the fitting-up of her house the American\r\nwoman is apt to be thrifty, ingenious and economical; and since she has\r\nlearned what decorative art really is, she works miracles of cleverness\r\nand beauty. And, as we began by saying, it is a real blessing to have a\r\nnew topic of conversation. True, there can be nothing more fatiguing to\r\nthose who are free from the mania for pottery and porcelain than a\r\ndiscussion between china-lovers and china-hunters concerning, for\r\ninstance, the difference between porcelain from Lowestoft and porcelain\r\nfrom China. Then, again, in the society of a real enthusiast one is apt\r\nto be bored by a recapitulation of his or her full accumulations of\r\nknowledge. You are shown a bit of \"crackle.\" You look at it admiringly\r\nand express your pleasure. Is that enough? Can the subject be dismissed\r\nso easily? Far from it. \"This is _real_ crackle,\" the collector insists,\r\nwith more than a suspicion that you under-value the worth of his\r\nspecimen; and then and there you have the history of crackle and the\r\npoints of difference between the imitation and the real. And in glancing\r\nat his collection your tongue must not trip nor your eye confound\r\nstyles. It requires a literal mind, besides a good memory and practised\r\nobservation, to be an expert, and diffused and generalized knowledge\r\namounts to little.\r\n\r\nWe have in mental view a lady who five years ago possessed apparently\r\nneither powers of thought nor capacity for expression, but who has,\r\nsince she became a collector of china and antique furniture, developed\r\ninto a tireless talker. Formerly she sat in her pale gray-and-blue rooms\r\ndressed faultlessly, \"splendidly null,\" and you sought in vain for a\r\ntopic which could warm her into interest or thaw out a sign of life from\r\nher. Now her rooms are studies, so picturesquely has she arranged her\r\ncabinets of china, her Oriental rugs and hangings, and her Queen Anne\r\nfurniture; and she herself seems a new creature, so transfused is she by\r\nthis fine fire of enthusiasm which illuminates her face and warms her\r\ntongue into eloquence. There is no dearth of subjects now. The briefest\r\nallusion to the Satsuma cup on the table beside you, and the lady, well\r\nequipped with matter, starts out on a tireless recapitulation of the\r\ndelights and fatigues of collecting. She is a better woman and a much\r\nless dull one from this blossom of sympathy and interest with something\r\noutside of the old meaningless conditions of her life.\r\n\r\nWe all remember that it was a point of etiquette inculcated in our youth\r\nnever to make allusion to the furniture and fittings of the houses where\r\nwe paid visits. That rule is far more honored in the breach than in the\r\nobservance now-a-days. It would show chilling coldness not to inquire if\r\nour fair friend herself embroidered the curtains of velvet and\r\nmummy-cloth which drape her doors and windows, and if that plaque were\r\nreally painted by one of the Society of Decorative Art, and not imported\r\nfrom Doulton.\r\n\r\nIt would, in fact, seem as if this initiation in fresh ideas and\r\naims--which, even if trivial, are higher than the old uncreative forms\r\nof occupation and interest--was an answer to the yearning of the\r\nfeminine mind for something to sweep thoughts and impulses into a\r\ncurrent which results in action. And certainly any action which lends\r\ninterest, worth and beauty to domestic life, which draws out talent and\r\npromotes culture, is deserving of all encouragement.\r\n\r\n  L. W.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE TROCADERO.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no portion of the Paris Exhibition of 1878 which has excited\r\nmore attention or attracted more visitors than has the Palace of the\r\nTrocadero. Yet few of the visitors who pass beneath its lofty portals\r\never imagine that the site of the sumptuous edifice is haunted by\r\nhistorical associations of no slight degree of interest. In fact, before\r\nthe palace \"rose like an exhalation\" at the bidding of the skilled\r\narchitects employed by the government few persons knew anything about\r\nthe Trocadero at all. That lofty eminence, incomparably the finest\r\nbuilding-site in Paris, with its graduated slopes gay with flowers and\r\nverdure, has long been a favorite lounging-place for Parisian artisans\r\nwhen out for a holiday, or for tourists seeking for a good view of the\r\ncity and shrinking from the fatigue of climbing to the top of the Arc de\r\nTriomphe. Yet no one seemed to know anything of its history, or even why\r\na hill in Paris should bear the name of a Spanish fort. And yet, to a\r\ncertain extent, the spot is one of genuine historical interest.\r\nSuccessively a feudal manor, a royal domain, a cloister, and the site of\r\nunrealized projects of the later monarchs of France, religion, ambition,\r\nsorrow and glory have there at different times sought a refuge or a\r\npedestal.\r\n\r\nThe Trocadero occupies a part of the site of the ancient village of\r\nChaillot, whose existence can be traced back to the eleventh century. In\r\nits earlier days this village was celebrated for its vineyards and\r\ngardens and for its enchanting view; which last charm its site still\r\nretains. It was bestowed by Louis XI. on the historian Philippe de\r\nComines, from whose heirs the domain was purchased by Catherine de\r\nMedicis. The building-loving queen caused a palace to be erected there,\r\nbut of that edifice no trace now remains. After the death of the queen,\r\nChaillot and its palace became the property of the President Janin, who\r\nprobably tore down and rebuilt the royal abode, as he is accused in the\r\nmemoirs of the time of being largely possessed by a mania for pulling\r\ndown and rebuilding all the mansions in his possession. An engraving of\r\nthe edifice as he left it exists in the Bibliotheque Nationale. It shows\r\na very charming structure in the Renaissance style, erected, apparently,\r\nat a point halfway down the slope, since there are two lines of terraces\r\nbehind it, as well as many in front.\r\n\r\nThe next owner of the domain of Chaillot was Francois de Bassompierre,\r\nformer friend and boon-companion of Henri IV. He did not occupy it very\r\nlong, being sent to the Bastile by Cardinal de Richelieu a very few\r\nyears after the purchase was completed. During his imprisonment he lent\r\nChaillot to his sister-in-law, Madame de Nemours. One day Richelieu sent\r\nto the Bastile to request his prisoner to let him occupy Chaillot as a\r\nsummer abode. Bassompierre accordingly sent word to his sister-in-law\r\nthat she must make way for the all-powerful minister. Richelieu\r\nremained at Chaillot for over six weeks, and declared that the furniture\r\nof the apartments was far finer than anything in that line which the\r\nking possessed.\r\n\r\nThe sad figure of Henriette Marie, the widowed queen of Charles I. of\r\nEngland, and youngest daughter of Henri IV., comes next upon the scene.\r\nShe it was who, having purchased Chaillot after her return to France,\r\nestablished there the convent of Les Dames de la Visitation. A chapel\r\nwas added to the extensive structure left behind by her father's old\r\ncomrade, and it was in that chapel that her funeral sermon was preached\r\nby Bossuet--one of the first of those marvellous pieces of funereal\r\neloquence which more than aught else have contributed to render his name\r\nimmortal.\r\n\r\nNext we have a vision of Louise de la Valliere, \"like Niobe, all tears,\"\r\nflying to the arms of the abbess of the Visitandines for refuge from the\r\nanguish of beholding the insolent De Montespan enthroned in her place.\r\nIt took all the eloquence and persuasive powers of Colbert to induce the\r\nfair weeper to return with him to Versailles. She yielded at last, but\r\nnot without many sad forebodings that were destined to be only too\r\nperfectly fulfilled. \"When I left the king before, he came for me: now,\r\nhe sends for me,\" she sighed. She bade farewell to the abbess, assuring\r\nher that she would speedily return. But when, after three years more of\r\nsuffering and humiliation, she finally retired to a convent, she did not\r\nenter that of the Visitandines, but that of the Carmelites, then\r\nsituated in the Faubourg St. Jacques.\r\n\r\nIn 1707 a dispute between the Superior of the Visitandines and the\r\nofficers of the king led to the abolition of the feudal privileges of\r\nChaillot, and it was created a suburb of the city of Paris. Henceforward\r\nthe quiet convent belongs no more to history. From the windows of their\r\ncells the nuns could behold the laying out of the Champ de Mars and the\r\nerection of the new military school decreed by Louis XV. But they were\r\nnot destined to witness the Festival of the Republic, which took place\r\non the Champ de Mars, since in 1790 the convent was suppressed and the\r\nnuns dispersed. The buildings still remained, and were devoted to\r\nvarious public uses till they were swept away to give place to the\r\ngigantic project of the First Napoleon, whose plans, had they been\r\ncarried out, would have totally changed that quarter of Paris and\r\nrendered it one of the most beautiful portions of the city.\r\n\r\nPercier and Fontaine, the architects of the emperor, have left behind\r\nthem a full account of the projects of their imperial master relative to\r\nthe heights of Chaillot. Being commissioned to erect a palace at Lyons,\r\nthey opposed the idea on account of the difficulty of finding a suitable\r\nsite for the projected building, and proposed instead the hill of\r\nChaillot as being the finest site that it was possible to find in\r\nFrance. Their proposition was accepted: the buildings then occupying the\r\nheight were purchased and torn down, and the works were commenced. The\r\nplan of Napoleon was a grandiose one, including not only the palace, to\r\nwhich he gave the name of his son, calling it the \"Palace of the King of\r\nRome,\" but also a series of buildings filling up three out of the four\r\nsides of the Champ de Mars, including two barracks, a military hospital\r\nand a palace of archives, as well as edifices for schools of art and\r\nindustry. As to the palace itself, it was to have a frontage of over\r\nfourteen hundred feet on the Quai de Billy--an extent which is about\r\nthat of the present Palace of the Trocadero. The whole of the plain of\r\nPassy, which was but little built upon at that epoch, was to be\r\ntransformed into a wooded park stretching to and including the Bois de\r\nBoulogne. The grounds surrounding the palace were to be joined to the\r\nAvenue de Neuilly, to the Arc de Triomphe and to the high road of St.\r\nGermain by wide avenues bordered with trees.\r\n\r\nThis splendid project was destined never to be realized. Hardly had the\r\nfoundations of the palace been laid when the disastrous campaign of\r\nMoscow put an end to the works. Money was wanted for soldiers and\r\nammunition more than for palaces and parks. After the battle of\r\nLeipsic, Napoleon had the idea of making of his scarcely-commenced\r\npalace a Sans Souci like that of Frederick the Great--a quiet retreat\r\nwhere he could escape from the toils and cares of empire. But hardly had\r\nthe works been recommenced on this diminished basis when the abdication\r\nof the emperor and his exile to Elba came to put a stop to them anew,\r\nand this time a decisive one; for, though a few workmen were employed in\r\nlevelling the grounds and building the walls during the Hundred Days,\r\nthere was neither spirit nor conviction in the work: the illusions of\r\nother days had fled, and were not to be revived. It was impossible for\r\neven the most sanguine partisans of Napoleon to imagine that the palace\r\nwould ever be completed and receive him as a tenant.\r\n\r\nUnder the Restoration it was decided to utilize the deserted foundations\r\nand to erect thereon a barrack. The laying of the cornerstone of the new\r\nedifice was made the occasion of a solemn festival in honor of the\r\nsuccesses of the French army in Spain. The day chosen was the\r\nanniversary of the taking of the fort of the Trocadero at Cadiz by the\r\nduc d'Angouleme, and the better to mark the occasion the height on which\r\nthe new barrack was to stand was solemnly rebaptized by the name of the\r\nfort in question. The programme of the fete was long and elaborate. It\r\nconsisted of a representation of the taking of the Trocadero, a sham\r\nbattle in which twenty battalions of the royal guard took part. Then\r\ncame the laying of the cornerstone, which duty was performed by the\r\ndauphin and dauphiness. But the projected barrack of the Bourbons shared\r\nthe fate of the palace of Napoleon. It was never built, and for nearly\r\nthirty years the ruins of the abandoned foundations and terraces were\r\nleft to be picturesquely clothed with weeds and wild grasses. Only the\r\nname bestowed upon the height remained, and it was still called the\r\nTrocadero.\r\n\r\nUnder the Second Empire the laying out of the numerous handsome avenues\r\nwhich extend around the Arc de Triomphe, and have it for a centre,\r\nnecessitated the clearing and levelling of the deserted site. It was at\r\nfirst proposed to erect there a monument in commemoration of the\r\nvictories of Magenta and Solferino, and the plans were actually drawn\r\nup: it was to have consisted of a lofty column, surpassing in its\r\ndimensions any similar monument in Paris. At the base of this column a\r\nfountain and a vast cascade were to be constructed, and the slope was to\r\nhave been laid with turf and planted with trees. But this project, too,\r\ncame to naught, and the Exhibition of 1867 only impelled the authorities\r\ninto grading and laying out the ground, strengthening and repairing the\r\nflights of steps that led to the summit, and embellishing it with\r\ngrass-plats and flower-beds. Later, the project was conceived by\r\nNapoleon III. of erecting on the summit of the Trocadero a Grecian\r\ntemple in white marble, destined to receive the busts of the great men\r\nof France with commemorative inscriptions--a project which the downfall\r\nof the Second Empire found unrealized. The ancient site of the village\r\nof Chaillot seemed like one of those spots of which we read in monkish\r\nlegends, which are haunted by a demon that destroys the work and blights\r\nthe existence of whoever attempts to build upon them. Palace, barracks,\r\nmonument and temple alike never existed, and were but the shadowy\r\nprecursors of disaster to their projectors. It was reserved for the\r\nThird Republic to break the evil spell, and to crown the picturesque and\r\nhistoric eminence with an edifice worthy of the beauty of the site and\r\nof its associations with the past.\r\n\r\n  L. H. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWISS ENGINEERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, of all the countries of Europe, presents the most grave and\r\nnumerous obstacles to intercommunication. The number and size of the\r\nmountains and glaciers, the depth of the valleys, the torrential\r\ncharacter of the rivers,--everything unites to make the highways cost\r\nenormously in money, while the feats of skill they necessitate are \"the\r\ntriumph of civil engineers, the wonder of tourists, the despair of\r\nshareholders and the burden of budgets.\" Among these triumphs are the\r\nviaduct of Grandfey; the railroads that climb the Righi and the\r\nUetliberg; the Axen tunnel and quay; and the Gotthard tunnel, over nine\r\nmiles long--a solid granite bore through a mountain. One that was\r\nhonored by a national celebration on the 16th of last August was the\r\nreclaiming from the water of the vast plain called Seeland, the\r\nterritory occupying the triangle bounded by the river Aar and the Lakes\r\nof Bienne, Neufchatel and Morat. It was wholly under water, and had\r\nslowly emerged after many centuries; but despite an extensive system of\r\ndrainage the land was never dry enough for serious cultivation. In rainy\r\nyears it was even covered with water, making, with the three lakes, a\r\nsheet nearly twenty-five miles square.\r\n\r\nThe great work celebrated last August was no less than the changing the\r\nbed of the Aar and the lowering of the three lakes mentioned. The Aar in\r\nthis region is about the size of the Seine at Paris or of the Hudson at\r\nTroy, but it is subject to sudden floods that are the terror of dwellers\r\nand property-owners along its borders. A Swiss colonel named La Nicca\r\nwas the author of the grand scheme for reclaiming Seeland. The\r\nproposition he made was accepted in 1867, and, thanks to the sacrifices\r\nof the citizens in the communes and cantons immediately interested, and\r\nalso to a heavy national subsidy, the enterprise was commenced, and so\r\nvigorously and ably prosecuted that in ten years it was finished.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Aar, turned out of its ancient bed near Aarsberg, runs nearly\r\nwest instead of north-east toward Soleure, and empties into Lake Bienne\r\nnear its middle. The new bed or canal made for this river is over five\r\nand a half miles long, and some of the way it is three hundred and\r\ntwenty-eight feet deep. But this is only a part of the work. Another\r\nvast canal, also over five and a half miles long, at the eastern\r\nextremity of the lake, not far from the pretty village of Bienne,\r\nreceives the overflow not only of Lake Bienne, but of Neufchatel and\r\nMorat, which are all three connected by broad canals, and are now in\r\ncommunication with the Rhine by steam navigation. The canal at the\r\neastern extremity of Lake Bienne opens into the Aar some seven miles\r\nbelow where that river was cut off. It is in fact the bed of the river\r\nThiele, deepened and reconstructed.\r\n\r\nThe deepening of the bed of the Thiele, the natural outlet of Lake\r\nBienne, was effected according to principles that would ensure the\r\nlowering of the water-level of all the three lakes some ten feet! Thus a\r\nvast territory of swampy land, which once bore only reeds, now yields\r\nabundant harvests of grain and fruits. Of course the lowering of these\r\nthree lakes had to be effected gradually, for the volume of water\r\nremoved--no less than three thousand two hundred and eighty million\r\ncubic feet--represents a stupendous force. By this enterprise the whole\r\nplain of Seeland has become higher than the surface of the lakes, and\r\nconsequently drains into them naturally. Already a beautiful village,\r\nWitzwyl, has sprung up, surrounded by some seven hundred and fifty\r\nthousand acres of fine arable land reclaimed from a forbidding,\r\nmalaria-exhaling marsh.\r\n\r\n  M. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE OF THE DAY.\r\n\r\n     The Ceramic Art: A Compendium of the History and Manufacture of\r\n     Pottery and Porcelain. By Jennie J. Young. New York: Harper &\r\n     Brothers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"More crockery!\" exclaims one aweary of the ceramic craze. \"And the\r\nbiggest book of all!--the winding-up shower, let us hope,\" quoth another\r\nnon-sympathizer.\r\n\r\nThis portly octavo, with its four hundred and sixty-four wood-cuts, a\r\nseemingly exhaustive compend of the subject, may indeed be accepted as\r\nthe peroratory rain destined to give the soil its last preparation for\r\nthe rich growth to follow under a clear and sunny sky. What pen and\r\nprint can do to perfect the requisite conditions for a Periclean age of\r\npottery must by this time have been done. The case is summed up and\r\nstated. The issue rests with the jury of millions who use and admire\r\nburnt clay. Their wants, their sense of beauty and their purse will\r\nrender the verdict. We might more safely and properly say that they will\r\nrender a number of verdicts, all in their way and sphere just and true,\r\nsince in no one of the arts so much as in this of all times and all\r\nnations is it so difficult to subject the infinitude of styles and\r\nfancies to one rigid canon. That the Greek vase is an absolute exemplar\r\nin grace and elegance of form every one hastens to concede. But who\r\nwould hesitate to give up a part of what the Greeks have bequeathed us\r\nrather than lose the marvellous filigree in clay of \"Henri Deux,\" the\r\nrich realism of Palissy or the wild and delightful riot of line and\r\ncolor and unequalled delicacy of manipulation presented to us by the\r\nJapanese? One and the same eye, as highly and soundly educated as you\r\nplease, may be charmed almost equally by works of each of these schools\r\nand of others not here named; and that almost without wishing to see the\r\npeculiar merits of each combined and merged in one. A perfect eclectic\r\nvase is not to be expected, if desired, any more than a fruit or a wine\r\nwhich shall unite the best flavors of all orchards or all vintages. What\r\ncan be done is to strive in that direction, as the French cook seeks, by\r\n\"composing,\" to attain in one supreme _plat_ the _ne plus ultra_ of\r\nsapidity. We shall not be able, any more than he, to reach that climax\r\nor to dull the charm of variety. The fusing of the Greek brain and the\r\nOriental eye and finger in the alembic of Western Europe and the New\r\nWorld will still continue to be attempted.\r\n\r\nTrade, the great amalgamator, is promoting this end. Chinese porcelain\r\nhas long been sent to Japan for decoration, the resemblance between the\r\nstyles of the two countries, due primarily to race, being thus\r\nincreased. American biscuit is sent to England for the like purpose; and\r\nwe read with more surprise that the unfinished ware of Dresden seeks\r\nornamentation in the same country, whence it is returned to be placed\r\nupon the market as true Meissen. A firm of New Yorkers, again, have\r\nmigrated to France and built up the beautiful fabric of Limoges with the\r\naid of French artists. The craftsmen of Japan and China are year by year\r\nborrowing Western forms and methods, as comparison of the ancient and\r\nmodern work of those nations will show clearly enough.\r\n\r\nWhile national idiosyncrasies the most opposite and the most widely\r\nseparated in every sense ally themselves in behalf of progress,\r\nindividual effort is encouraged by the reflection that no walk of art\r\noffers a more open field to original genius. Della Robbia, Bernart,\r\nPalissy and Wedgwood each found his own material and created his own\r\nschool. Neither of them possessed the facilities, educational or\r\nmechanical, now at the command of hundreds. Neither had as wide or as\r\neager a market for his productions as the coming artist in clay may\r\ncommand. Surely, such an artist is at this moment maturing his powers in\r\nsome one of the scores of training institutions which have sprung up,\r\nunder public or private auspices, within the past quarter of a century.\r\nThorwaldsen was not a man of great originative genius, and nothing at\r\nall of a potter, troubling himself little about hard or soft paste or\r\nthis or the other glaze; but he infused the love of classic form into\r\nthe bleakest corners of Scandinavia, and made her youth modellers of\r\nterra-cotta into shapes unexcelled by any imitators of the antique. The\r\nprize awaits him who should, upon such knowledge and discipline, graft a\r\nstudy of Oriental designs, an eye for color, an independent fancy, and\r\nsuch minute precision of manual dexterity as seems the hardest thing of\r\nall for the Western to acquire. He will not have, like his great\r\nforerunners, to invent his material. Science does not repress, it\r\ninvites and assists him. It offers him mineral colors and modes of\r\ngraduating heat unknown to them. All the secrets of porcelain are open\r\nto him; and were they not, Europe did all her best things in ceramics\r\nbefore she was able to make a porcelain teacup. He may find room for\r\nimprovement in material too. Pottery is the most durable of fabrics so\r\nlong as it is not broken. But it is fragile, as bronze is not. Why may\r\nnot that defect be remedied, as other defects have been by the Japanese\r\nand our bank-note printers in that particularly evanescent texture,\r\npaper? Some day, perhaps, burnt clay will be held together by threads of\r\nasbestos as greenbacks are by threads of silk and the sun-burned\r\nEgyptian bricks were by straw. Malleable glass we have already. Why not\r\nmalleable faience?\r\n\r\nThe book before us presents the art, its history, its processes and its\r\nresults in a manner every way satisfactory. Its account is full without\r\nbeing prolix. The author's taste is catholic enough. The different\r\nstyles are placed before the reader side by side, with an evident\r\npurpose to do justice to all of them. There is little of the jargon of\r\nthe connoisseur. Marks are curtly dismissed with the sound dictum that\r\n\"the art and not the mark should be studied.\" Much use is made of the\r\nengravings, which are more closely connected with the text than,\r\nunfortunately, is generally the case in illustrated works. They are\r\nstrictly illustrations of it, and serve as good a purpose in that way as\r\ncuts without the aid of color could well do. Nothing is more difficult\r\nto reproduce than a first-class work in clay or porcelain. Color,\r\ndrawing, form, surface and texture present a compound of difficulties\r\nnot to be completely overcome by the resources of the graver, the camera\r\nand the printer in colors. Only on the shelves of the museum can it be\r\nstudied understandingly. It must speak for itself. The chromo undertakes\r\nto duplicate, with more or less success, the painting in oil or fresco,\r\nbut the vase is a picture and something more. It is the joint product of\r\nthe painter and the sculptor, and the substance whereon they bestow\r\ntheir labor has a special and varying beauty of its own.\r\n\r\nIn the pages devoted to the history of American pottery we confess that\r\nwe have been chiefly attracted by its antiquities. The specimens given\r\nof remains from all parts of the two continents show at a glance their\r\ncommon origin. They all come unmistakably from the hands of the same\r\nIndian, civilized or savage. The Moquis, the Mound-builders, the Aztecs\r\nand the Peruvians all wrought their mother, Earth, into the same\r\nfashion, and adorned her countenance, purified by fire, with scrolls and\r\ncolors in the same taste. The pigments employed have proved as lasting\r\nas those in the Egyptian tombs, and the forms are often as graceful as\r\nin a majority of the Phoenician vessels found in Cyprus. In the\r\nrepresentation of the human head the Peruvian artist, so far as we may\r\njudge from these relics, excelled his rival of Tyre and Sidon.\r\n\r\nThat this will become a handbook on the subject of which it treats\r\ncannot be doubted. If we might venture to suggest an amendment to the\r\nsecond edition, it would be the addition to the illustrations of two or\r\nthree figures carefully executed in colors--Greek, Japanese and Sevres.\r\n\r\n\r\n     Like unto Like. By Sherwood Bonner. (Library of American Fiction.)\r\n     New York: Harper & Brothers.\r\n\r\nSherwood Bonner has been singularly happy in her choice of a subject for\r\nthis, her first novel. She has broken new ground on that Southern soil\r\nwhich seemed already for literary purposes wellnigh worn out, and she\r\nhas touched upon a period in the struggle between North and South which,\r\nso far as we know, has been little treated by novelists. The antagonists\r\nare represented not in the smoke of battle, but at that critical and\r\nawkward moment when the first steps toward reconciliation are being\r\nmade. A proud but sociable little Mississippi town is shown in the act\r\nof half-reluctantly opening its doors to the officers of a couple of\r\nFederal regiments stationed within its bounds. The situation is\r\nportrayed with much spirit and humor, as well as with the most perfect\r\n_good_-humor. Thoroughly Southern as the novel is, it is not narrowly\r\nso: its pictures of Southern society are drawn from within, and show its\r\nwriter's sympathy with Southern feeling, yet its tone, even in touching\r\non the most tender spots, is entirely dispassionate, and at the same\r\ntime free from any apparent effort to be so.\r\n\r\nThe first chapter introduces us to a triad of charming girls, whose\r\ncareless talk soon turns upon the soldiers' expected arrival in Yariba\r\nand the proper reception to be given them by the Yariba damsels. Betty\r\nPage, Mary Barton and Blythe Herndon are, in a sense, typical girls, and\r\nrepresent the three orders in which nearly all girlhood may be\r\nclassified--namely, frivolous girls, good girls, and clever girls or\r\ngirls with ideas. Ideas are represented by Blythe Herndon, whose\r\noutspoken verdict in favor of tolerance and forgetfulness of the past\r\ndraws upon her the patriotic indignation of Miss Betty Page. How long\r\nthe fair disputants preserve the jewel of consistency forms the _motif_\r\nof the book. Betty dances and flirts, neglects her loyal young Southern\r\nlover--who, we hope, is consoled by Mary--and finally surrenders to a\r\nhandsome moustache and the Union with a happy unconsciousness of any\r\nabandonment of her principles. Blythe, with her ardent nature and\r\nyouthful attitude of intolerance toward intolerance, is easily attracted\r\nby the intellectual freedom which appears to open before her in the\r\nconversation of an enthusiastic New England radical. Her mind is,\r\nhowever, not wholly thrown off its balance by this vision of culture:\r\nshe awakens to the fact that the breach is wider than she had at first\r\ndreamed, and shrinks from the sacrifice not only of prejudice, but of\r\nfirst principles and affections, which is demanded of her. Lovers who\r\nare separated by hereditary or political strife have ever been a\r\nfavorite theme with poet and romancer. In the majority of instances\r\nthese unhappy beings have regarded the barrier between them as a useless\r\nobstacle erected by a perverse Fate in the way of their happiness. But\r\nMr. Roger Ellis adheres with narrow obstinacy to the least article of\r\nhis broad political creed, without a particle of consideration for the\r\ndifferent one in which Blythe has been nurtured. He flourishes the\r\nAmerican flag in his conversation in true stump-orator style, kisses\r\nblack babies in the street--when, as Betty Page remarks, no man was ever\r\nknown to kiss a white baby if he could help it--and refuses to eat\r\nwithout the company at table of a little black _protege_.\r\n\r\nPlot there is none in _Like unto Like_, and of incident very little.\r\nLight, often sparkling, conversations and charming bits of description\r\nfollow each other in ready succession like beads upon a string. Lack of\r\nincident is atoned for by charm of writing, and in the vivacity of the\r\nscenes the reader disregards the slenderness of the connecting thread,\r\nor perhaps forgets to look for it. The style is easy and pleasant, while\r\nfree from the slips to which \"easy writers\" are so prone. Of bright,\r\nwitty sayings a number could easily be gathered as samples, but the\r\nreaders would still have to be referred to the book for many more.\r\nPerhaps the main charm of _Like unto Like_ lies in its description of\r\nthe quaint life in Southern provincial towns, where the people \"all talk\r\nto each other as if they were members of one family,\" where married\r\nladies are still called by their friends \"Miss Kate,\" \"Miss Janey,\" or\r\n\"Miss Ada,\" and where, \"when a youth and maiden promise to marry each\r\nother, they become possessed immediately with a wild desire to conceal\r\ntheir engagement from all the world.\" There clings to the book a\r\nsuggestion of that Southern accent which in the mouth of a pretty woman\r\nhas such a piquant foreign sound.\r\n\r\n\r\n     His Heart's Desire: A Novel. Philadelphia: J. B. Lippincott & Co.\r\n\r\nWe can complain of no lack of plot or paucity of incidents in _His\r\nHeart's Desire_. Were the material less ably handled we should suggest\r\nan unnecessary redundancy, but we hesitate to pronounce superfluous\r\nanything which is so exactly fitted, so neatly dove-tailed into the main\r\nstructure, as is each incident and character in the present novel. About\r\na dozen individual and more or less finished personages contribute their\r\nlife-histories to the book, yet each of these lives has some bearing\r\nupon that of the heroine, Nora St. John, and notwithstanding these\r\nintricacies the plot never becomes confused. It has been too firmly\r\ngrasped by the author's mind to be a puzzle to the reader's. Its various\r\nramifications are never allowed to get into a \"snarl:\" the mystery all\r\nturns upon a single point which we will not spoil the reader's pleasure\r\nby mentioning, and, arrived at the last pages, the various threads of\r\nthe story unwind themselves easily and naturally like a single coil. The\r\nsame skill is displayed in the management of the characters. Though\r\ndrawn with unequal power, many of them being seized with much vividness,\r\nwhilst others must be accounted failures, they are well grouped.\r\nNumerous as the figures are, they never crowd or jostle each other, and\r\nelaborated as they are in many cases, all are subordinate to that of\r\nNora, whose character and story stand out in a strong relief not easy to\r\nobtain upon so varied a background. This character is finely conceived\r\nand drawn with real power, being impressive by the very truth of the\r\nrendering, for she is not invested with any strikingly heroic qualities.\r\nA strong, passionate nature made cold by suffering and the constant\r\nstruggle to keep the secret of her one season of passion from rising\r\nagain to confront her--a woman of forty, who has no longer any illusions\r\nor pleasure, in whose character intense pride is the only motive-power\r\nleft, and even pride is weary of its loneliness and the assaults made\r\nupon it--Nora excites interest, and even pity, by her position and by\r\nthe aspect of a strong nature under subdued but real suffering. In the\r\nlater pages of the book, and notably in the scene with Mr. Sistare, in\r\nwhich revelations are made by both, the changes gradual or sudden in her\r\nfeelings and thought are portrayed with the delicacy of light and shade,\r\nthe picturesqueness and self-forgetfulness, with which a fine actress\r\nrenders a part. This dramatic quality is perhaps the most striking trait\r\nin _His Heart's Desire_. Many of its scenes are intensely dramatic, full\r\nof passion, striking in situation, and showing a rather rare\r\naccomplishment--that of conducting a dialogue which shall be equally\r\nbrilliant on both sides without resembling a monologue.\r\n\r\nIn praising this novel so highly we do not forget its faults. But,\r\nthough perhaps as numerous as its merits, they are by no means equal to\r\nthem in importance. Something of naturalness and simplicity has been\r\nsacrificed to the exigences of the plot; and, while the higher truth is\r\nadhered to in the principal scenes and characters, some of the minor\r\nones appear to us rather highly colored. By distributing the fatal gift\r\nof beauty with a less lavish hand the author might, we think, have\r\nsubdued this color: a few commonplace figures would have added to the\r\nnaturalness of the scene.\r\n\r\nSensational the book may be pronounced from a glance through its chain\r\nof incidents, yet neither by its tone nor its writing does it belong to\r\nthe class which we call sensational. Its tone is earnest and sincere,\r\ngrave social questions being handled with a purity and feeling which\r\nmakes the book, in spite of its apparent unconsciousness of purpose, a\r\ndistinctly moral one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Books Received._\r\n\r\n\r\n     Books for Bright Eyes, embracing \"On the Farm,\" \"More Happy Days,\"\r\n     \"Mountain-Tops,\" \"One Day in our Long Vacation.\" By Mrs. M.
