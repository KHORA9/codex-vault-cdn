Many of us, without denying its growing\r\nmenace, hoped against hope that it might be averted by the gradual\r\nstrengthening of international goodwill and mutual intercourse, and the\r\nsteady growth of democratic influences and political thought. But our\r\nmisgivings proved more prophetic than our hopes; and last August the great\r\nwar came upon us like a thief in the night. After four months of war we\r\nfeel that, in spite of the splendid response of the nation at large, in\r\nspite of a unanimity which has no parallel in our previous history, there\r\nare still large sections of the community who fail to realise the vastness\r\nof the issues at stake, the formidable nature of the forces ranged against\r\nus, and the true inner significance of the struggle. And yet all that is\r\nworth living for depends upon the outcome of this war--for ourselves the\r\nfuture of the democratic ideal in these islands and in the British Empire\r\nat large, for the peoples of Europe deliverance from competing armaments\r\nand the yoke of racial tyranny. But before our future can be secured,\r\nsacrifices will be required of every citizen, and in a free community\r\nsacrifice can only spring from knowledge. Moreover, if we are to put an end\r\nto the intolerable situation of an unwilling Europe in arms, public opinion\r\nmust think out very carefully the great problems which have been thrown\r\ninto the melting-pot and be prepared for the day of settlement.\r\n\r\nThe present volume has been written as a guide to the study of the\r\nunderlying causes and issues of the war. It does not pretend to cover the\r\nwhole of so vast a field, and it will have attained its aim if it provides\r\nthe basis for future discussion. It originated in the experience of its\r\nfive writers at the Summer Schools for working-class students held in\r\nconnection with the Workers' Educational Associations. In the early days of\r\nAugust, at the outbreak of the war, Summer Schools were in full swing\r\nat Oxford, Cambridge, Eton, Bangor, and Durham, and it at once became\r\napparent, not merely that the word \"citizen\" had suddenly acquired a new\r\ndepth and significance for the men and women of our generation, but also\r\nthat for the individual citizen himself a large new field of study and\r\ndiscussion had been opened up on subjects and issues hitherto unfamiliar.\r\nThis book was planned to meet the need there expressed, but it is hoped\r\nthat it may be found useful by a wider circle of readers.\r\n\r\nWe have called the book _The War and Democracy_, because our guiding idea\r\nthroughout has been the sense of the great new responsibilities, both of\r\nthought and action, which the present situation lays upon British Democracy\r\nand on believers in democracy throughout the world.\r\n\r\nIn devoting one chapter to a survey of the issues raised for settlement by\r\nthe war, we must disclaim most emphatically all idea of dividing the\r\nlion's skin before the animal has been killed. Our object has not been to\r\nprophesy, but merely to stimulate thought and discussion. The field is so\r\nvast and complicated that unless public opinion begins to mobilise without\r\nfurther delay and to form clear ideas as to how the principles laid down\r\nby our statesmen are to be converted into practice, it may find itself\r\nconfronted, as it was confronted in 1814, with a situation which it can\r\nneither understand nor control, and with a settlement which will perpetuate\r\nmany of the abuses which this war ought to remove. Our best excuse is\r\nsupplied by the attitude of many leaders of German political thought--men\r\nlike Franz von Liszt, Ostwald; and Paul Rohrbach--who are already mapping\r\nout the world according to their victorious fancies.\r\n\r\n_December 1914._\r\n\r\nR.W.S.-W.

It follows\r\nfrom this very directly that only one thing can end war on the earth, and\r\nthat is a subtle mental development, an idea, the development of the idea\r\nof the world commonweal in the collective mind.\"--H.G. WELLS in 1908.\r\n\r\nTHIS is a testing time for Democracy. The people of Great Britain and the\r\nDominions, to whom all the world looks as the trustees, together with\r\nFrance and America, of the great democratic tradition, are brought face\r\nto face, for the first time, with their full ultimate responsibility as\r\nBritish citizens. Upon the way in which that responsibility is realised\r\nand discharged depends the future of the democratic principle, not only in\r\nthese islands, but throughout the world.\r\n\r\nDemocracy is not a mere form of government. It does not depend on ballot\r\nboxes or franchise laws or any constitutional machinery. These are but its\r\ntrappings. Democracy is a spirit and an atmosphere, and its essence is\r\ntrust in the moral instincts of the people. A tyrant is not a democrat, for\r\nhe believes in government by force; neither is a demagogue a democrat, for\r\nhe believes in government by flattery. A democratic country is a country\r\nwhere the government has confidence in the people and the people in the\r\ngovernment and in itself, and where all are united in the faith that the\r\ncause of their country is not a mere matter of individual or national\r\nself-interest, but is in harmony with the great moral forces which rule the\r\ndestinies of mankind. No form of government is so feeble as a democracy\r\nwithout faith. But a democracy armed with faith is not merely strong: it\r\nis invincible; for its cause will live on, in defeat and disaster, in the\r\nbreast of every one of its citizens. Belgium is a living testimony to that\r\ngreat truth.\r\n\r\nBritish Democracy has carried this principle of confidence to the furthest\r\npossible point. Alone among the States of Europe, Great Britain relies for\r\nher existence and for the maintenance of her world-wide responsibilities\r\nupon the free choice of her citizens. Her privileges are extended to all:\r\nher active obligations are forced upon none. Trusting in the principle of\r\nindividual freedom, and upon the sound instinct and understanding of her\r\npeople, she leaves it to each citizen to make his choice whether, and in\r\nwhat manner, he shall serve his country. Never have responsibilities so\r\narduous and so urgent been laid upon the citizens of any community: and\r\nnever have the citizens been so free to choose or to decline the burden.\r\nThe world will judge Great Britain, and judge Democracy, according to the\r\nmeasure of our free response.\r\n\r\nWhat is the nature of the responsibility cast upon us at this crisis?\r\n\r\nIt is threefold. It concerns the present, the past, and the future. There\r\nare three questions which every citizen must needs ask, and try to answer,\r\nfor himself. The first and most urgent is a matter of present decision:\r\nWhat is my duty here and now? The second involves a judgment of past\r\nevents: Why is it that we are at war? Are we fighting in a just cause? The\r\nthird involves an estimate of the future and of the part which British\r\npublic opinion can and should play in shaping it: What are the issues\r\ninvolved in the various belligerent countries? What should be the\r\nprinciples of a just settlement? How can Great Britain best use her\r\ninfluence in the cause of human progress and for the welfare of the peoples\r\ninvolved in the war?\r\n\r\nIt is with the second and especially with the third of these\r\nresponsibilities that this volume is concerned.\r\n\r\n\"What is the war about?\" \"Are we fighting in a just cause?\" Every one by\r\nnow has asked himself this question, and most people have studied some at\r\nleast of the evidence, and tried to satisfy themselves as to the answer.\r\nThe Foreign Office White Paper and numberless books and pamphlets have\r\nenlightened the public on many of the questions at issue. Yet the fact\r\nremains that the necessity of this educative campaign involves a confession\r\nof failure--or at least of grave neglect--on the part of British democracy.\r\nUnder our democratic constitution the people of Great Britain have assumed\r\nthe responsibility for the management of their own affairs. One great\r\ndepartment of those affairs, the most vital of all, they and their\r\nrepresentatives have systematically neglected. Deeply engaged and\r\ninterested in domestic problems, they have left the control of their\r\nforeign relations in the hands of expert advisers. And so it was with\r\nsomething like stupefaction that they discovered, one day in August, that\r\nthey were called upon to honour the obligations contracted in their name.\r\n\r\nThere has been no desire to evade those obligations. But there has been a\r\nvery real desire to understand them, and also a fixed determination never\r\nagain to allow such a lack of contact, on vital issues, between the mind of\r\nthe people and the activities of their ministers.\r\n\r\nBut no mere changes in the machinery of democratic control can avail to\r\nsave the people from the consequences of their own ignorance and neglect.\r\nThere is only one way in which we can achieve full Democracy in this\r\ncountry, and that is through Education.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of domestic affairs, particularly in connection with social\r\nand industrial questions, the people have slowly realised this hard truth.\r\nAfter a generation or more of attempts and failures and disillusionments\r\nmany thousands of workpeople have learnt the lesson that power without\r\nknowledge is not power at all, and that knowledge, whether for public\r\naffairs or for any other purpose, cannot be gained without effort and\r\ndiscipline. They have come to realise that Democracy needs, for its full\r\nworking, not only schools in which to train its young, but also--what\r\nno Democracy save those of the ancient world has ever possessed--such\r\nfacilities for the education for its adult citizens, engaged in the active\r\nwork of the community, as will enable them to maintain unimpaired their\r\nintellectual freshness and vigour, and to face with wisdom and courage the\r\nproblems for which, as citizens, they have assumed responsibility. They\r\nhave come to think of Education, not as a time of tutelage or training, but\r\nas a part of active life itself, woven of the same texture and concerned\r\nwith the same issues, as being, in fact, the effort to understand the world\r\nin which they live. But they have naturally tended to confine those issues\r\nwithin the limits of their own domestic interests and experience. They\r\nare called upon now to widen their horizon, and to apply the democratic\r\nconception of education to the new problems which have arisen owing to the\r\npart which Great Britain is now playing in the affairs of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is never easy to think things out clearly and coldly. But it is hardest\r\nof all in the crisis of a great war, when men's minds are blurred by\r\npassionate emotions of sorrow, anxiety, and indignation. Hence a time of\r\nwar is the heyday of fallacies and delusions, of misleading hopes and\r\npremature disillusionments: men tend to live in an unreal world of phrases\r\nand catchwords. Yet never is it more necessary than at such a period, in\r\nthe old Greek phrase, \"to follow the argument whithersoe'er it leads,\"\r\nto look facts squarely in the face, and, particularly, the great ugly\r\noutstanding fact of war itself, the survival of which democrats, especially\r\nin Great Britain and the United States, have of recent years been so\r\ngreatly tempted to ignore.\r\n\r\nPeople speak as if war were a new sudden and terrible phenomenon. There is\r\nnothing new about the fact of war. What is new about this war is the scale\r\non which it is waged, the science and skill expended on it, and the fact\r\nthat it is being carried on by national armies, numbering millions, instead\r\nof by professional bodies of soldiers. But war itself is as old as the\r\nworld: and if it surprises and shocks us this is due to our own blindness.\r\nThere are only two ways of settling disputes between nations, by law or\r\nby war. As there is as yet no World-State, with the power to enforce\r\na World-law between the nations, the possibility of war, with all its\r\ncontingent horrors, should have been before our eyes all the time. The\r\n_occasion_ of this war was no doubt a surprise. But that it could happen at\r\nall should not be a surprise to us, still less a disillusionment. It does\r\nnot mark a backward step in human civilisation. It only registers the\r\nfact that civilisation is still grievously incomplete and unconsolidated.\r\nTerrible as this war is in its effect on individual lives and happiness, it\r\nought not to depress us--even if, in our blindness, we imagined the world\r\nto be a far better organised place than it actually is. The fact that many\r\nof the combatants regard war as an anachronism adds to the tragedy, but\r\nalso to the hope, of the struggle. It shows that civilised opinion is\r\ngathering strength for that deepening and extension of the meaning and\r\nrange of citizenship which alone can make war between the nations of the\r\nworld as obsolete as it has become between the nations of the British\r\nEmpire or between the component parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt was perhaps inevitable that British citizens in particular, removed from\r\nthe storm centres of Continental Europe, and never very logical in their\r\nthinking, should have failed to realise the possibility of another great\r\nwar, similar to the Napoleonic struggle of a hundred years ago. For nearly\r\nhalf a century the great European States had been at peace: and we had come\r\nto look upon their condition, and the attachment of their peoples, as being\r\nas ancient and as stable as our own. We had grown used to the map of Europe\r\nas it had been left by the great convulsions between 1848 and 1871. Upon\r\nthe basis of that map and of the governments represented on it, and in\r\nresponse to the growing needs of the world as a whole, we had embarked on\r\nevery kind of international co-operation and cosmopolitan effort. The Hague\r\nCongress, convened by the Tsar of Russia, looked forward to the day when\r\nwar, and the causes of war, should be obsolete. The Socialist Movement, a\r\ngrowing force in all industrial communities, stood for the same ideal, and\r\nfor the international comradeship of the working class. Law and medicine,\r\nscience and scholarship followed suit; and every summer, in quest of\r\nhealth and change, thousands of plain citizens have crossed international\r\nfrontiers with scarcely greater sense of change than in moving from\r\nprovince to province in a single State. Commerce and industry, the greatest\r\nmaterial forces of our time, have become inextricably international, and\r\nin the palpable injury in which a war would involve them some thinkers\r\nof clear but limited vision saw the best hope of averting a European\r\nconflagration.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, throughout these two generations of economic and social\r\ndevelopment, the fear of war has never been absent from the mind of Europe.\r\nHer emperors and statesmen have talked of peace; but they have prepared for\r\nwar, more skilfully and more persistently than ever before in the history\r\nof Europe or of the world. Almost the entire manhood of every European\r\nnation but England has been trained to arms; and the annual war budget of\r\nEurope rose, in time of peace, to over 300 million pounds. The States of\r\nEurope, each afraid to stand alone against a coalition of possible rivals,\r\nformed themselves into opposing groups; and each of the groups armed\r\nfeverishly against the other, fearful lest, by any change in the diplomatic\r\nor political situation, they might be caught unawares and suffer loss.\r\nThus, it ought not to have surprised us that finally, through the accident\r\nof a royal murder, the spark should be fired and the explosion ensue,\r\nand that merchants and manufacturers, propagandists and philanthropists,\r\nscholars and scientists, should find the ground shaken beneath their\r\nfeet and the projects patiently built up through years of international\r\nco-operation shattered by the events of a few days.\r\n\r\nNow that the war has come it is easy to see that they were mistaken. They\r\nhad built up the structure of a cosmopolitan society without looking to\r\nthe foundations. The economic activities of mankind have indeed brought a\r\nWorld-Society and a World-Industry into being; but its political analogue,\r\na World-State, can only be formed, not through the co-operation of\r\nindividuals or groups of individuals, but through the union of nations and\r\nthe federation of national governments. The first task of our time for\r\nEurope, as we shall try to show in the next chapter, is to lay firm the\r\nfoundations of those nations by carrying to victory the twin principles of\r\nNationality and Democracy--to secure that the peoples of Europe shall be\r\nenabled to have governments corresponding to their national needs and\r\nresponsible to their own control, and to build up, under the care\r\nand protection of those governments, the social institutions and the\r\ncivilisation of their choice. So long as there are peoples in Europe under\r\nalien governments, curtailed in the use of their own language,[1] in the\r\npropagation of their literature and ideas, in their social intercourse, in\r\ntheir corporate life, in all that we in Great Britain understand by civil\r\nliberty, so long will there be men who will mock at the very idea of\r\ninternational peace, and look forward to war, not as an outworn instrument\r\nof a barbarous age, but as a means to national freedom and self-expression.\r\nEnglishmen sometimes forget that there are worse evils than open war, both\r\nin political and industrial relations, and that the political causes for\r\nwhich their fathers fought and died have still to be carried to victory on\r\nthe Continent. Nationality and their national institutions are the very\r\nlife-blood of English people. They are as natural to them as the air\r\nthey breathe. That is what makes it sometimes so difficult for them to\r\nunderstand, as the history of Ireland and even of Ulster shows, what\r\nnationality means to other peoples. And that is why they have not realised,\r\nnot only that there are peoples in Europe living under alien governments,\r\nbut that there are governments in Europe so foolish as to think that men\r\nand women deprived of their national institutions, humiliated in their\r\ndeepest feelings, and forced into an alien mould, can make good citizens,\r\ntrustworthy soldiers, or even obedient subjects.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The German official _communiqué_ on August 26, 1914, reports\r\nas follows: \"All the newspapers in Belgium, with the exception of those in\r\nAntwerp, are printed in the German language.\" This, of course, is on the\r\nmodel of the Prussian administration of Poland. The Magyars are more\r\nrepressive even than the Germans. See the bibliography given in _General\r\nBooks_ below.]\r\n\r\nThe political causes of the present war, then, and of the half century\r\nof Armed Peace which preceded it are to be found, not in the particular\r\nschemes and ambitions of any of the governments of Europe, nor in their\r\nsecret diplomacy, nor in the machinations of the great armament interests\r\nallied to them, sinister though all these may have been, but in the nature\r\nof some of those governments themselves, and in their relation to the\r\npeoples over whom they rule.\r\n\r\n\"If it were possible,\" writes Prince Büllow, who directed German policy\r\nas Imperial Chancellor from 1900 to 1909, \"for members of different\r\nnationalities, with different language and customs, and an intellectual\r\nlife of a different kind, to live side by side in one and the same State,\r\nwithout succumbing to the temptation of each trying to force his own\r\nnationality on the other, things on earth would look a good deal more\r\npeaceful. But it is a law of life and development in history that where\r\ntwo national civilisations meet they fight for ascendancy. In the struggle\r\nbetween nationalities one nation is the hammer and the other the anvil; one\r\nis the victor and the other the vanquished.\"[1] No words could indicate\r\nmore clearly the cause that is at stake in the present war. They show us\r\nthat there are still governments in Europe so ignorant as to believe that\r\nthe different nationalities of mankind are necessarily hostile to one\r\nanother, and so foolish and brutal as to think that national civilisation,\r\nor, as the German Professors call it, \"culture,\" can and indeed must be\r\npropagated by the sword. It is this extraordinary conception which is at\r\nthe back of protests like that of Professor Haeckel and Professor Eucken\r\n(men whom, in the field of their own studies, all Europe is proud to\r\nhonour) against \"England fighting with a half-Asiatic power against\r\nGermanism.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Imperial Germany_, by Prince Bernhard von Bülow, English\r\ntranslation, 1st ed. pp. 245-6 (London, 1914).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Protest of Professors Ernst Haeckel and Rudolf Eucken of Jena,\r\nquoted in _The Times_ from the _Vossische Zeitung_ of August 20, 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are not only half-Asiatics, there are real Asiatics side by side with\r\nEngland; and England is not ashamed of it. For she does not reckon the\r\nculture of Europe as higher than the culture of Asia, or regard herself as\r\nthe hammer upon the anvil of India.\r\n\r\nPrince Bülow's words, and the theory of policy underlying them, really go\r\nto the root of the whole trouble in European politics. They explain\r\nthe Balance of Power, the competition in armaments, the belief in the\r\ninevitability and the moral value of war, and all those common European\r\nshibboleths which seem so inexplicable to citizens of the more\r\nmodern-minded States and communities of the world. Why should Germany and\r\nAustria arm against France and Russia when Canada does not arm against\r\nthe United States? Why should a Balance of Power be necessary to the\r\nmaintenance of European Peace when we do not consider the preponderance\r\nof a single Power, such as the United States in North, Central and South\r\nAmerica, or Great Britain in the Pacific or Southern Asia dangerous to the\r\npeace of the whole world? Why, finally, to press Prince Bülow's logic home,\r\nif members of different nationalities cannot live side by side without\r\nplaying the game of Hammer and Anvil together, are not the English spending\r\nthe whole of their energy fighting the Welsh, the Scotch, and the Irish in\r\nthe United Kingdom, the Dutch in South Africa, and the French in Canada,\r\nnot to speak of the Jews in every part of the British Empire? The fact is\r\nthat the statesmen of Germany and Austria-Hungary, and of Russia also, have\r\nmissed the chief lesson of recent history and politics: that in the growing\r\ncomplexity of world-relations power is falling more and more, of necessity,\r\ninto the hands of States which are not Nations but Commonwealths of\r\nNations, States composed, like the British Empire and the United States, of\r\na variety of nationalities and \"cultures,\" living peacefully, each with its\r\nown institutions, under a single law and a single central government.\r\n\r\nBut the time is not ripe yet for a Commonwealth of Europe. The peoples of\r\nEurope have yet to win their liberties before they can be free to dream of\r\na United States of Europe. So long as the Emperors and statesmen of Central\r\nEurope believe, like the Mahomedans of old, that propaganda can be imposed\r\nby the sword, they can only be met by the sword, and controlled by the\r\nsword. Not till they have been conquered and rendered harmless, or\r\ndisplaced by the better mind of the peoples whom they have indoctrinated,\r\ncan Europe proceed along the natural course of her development.\r\n\r\nSo far we have been concerned--as we shall be concerned throughout this\r\nbook--with the _political_ causes underlying the war. But it would not be\r\nright to ignore the fact that there are other deeper causes, unconnected\r\nwith the actions of governments, for which we in this country are jointly\r\nresponsible with the rest of the civilised world.\r\n\r\nThis war is not simply a conflict between governments and nations for the\r\nattainment of certain political ends, Freedom and Nationality on the one\r\nside and Conquest and Tyranny on the other. It is also a great outburst\r\nof pent-up feeling, breaking like lava through the thin crust of European\r\ncivilisation. On the _political_ side, as we have said just now, the war\r\nreveals the fact that civilisation is still incomplete and ill-organised.\r\nBut on the _moral_ side it reveals the fact that modern society has broken\r\ndown, that the forces and passions that divide and embitter mankind have\r\nproved stronger, at the moment of strain, than those which bind them\r\ntogether in fellowship and co-operation. \"What we are suffering from,\"\r\nsays one of the greatest of living democrats,[1] \"is something far more\r\nwidespread than the German Empire. Is it not the case that what we are in\r\nface of is nothing less than the breakdown in a certain idea and hope of\r\ncivilisation, which was associated with the liberal and industrial movement\r\nof the last century? There was to be an inevitable and glorious progress\r\nof humanity of which science, commerce, and education were to be the main\r\ninstruments, and which was to be crowned with a universal peace. Older\r\nprophets like Thomas Carlyle expressed their contempt for the shallowness\r\nof this prevailing ideal, and during this century we have been becoming\r\nmore and more doubtful of its value. But we are now witnessing its\r\ndownfall. Science, commerce, and education have done, and can do, much for\r\nus. But they cannot expel the human spirit from human nature. What is\r\nthat? At bottom, love of self, self-interest, selfishness individual and\r\ncorporate. As a theory, the philosophy of selfishness has often been\r\nexposed. But, to an extent that is difficult to exaggerate, it has been the\r\nmotive, acknowledged and relied upon without shame or apology in commerce,\r\nin politics and in practical life. Our civilisation has been based on\r\nselfishness, our commerce on competition and the unrestricted love of\r\nwealth, our education on the motive of self-advancement. And science and\r\nknowledge, made the instrument of selfishness and competition, have armed\r\nman against man, class against class, and nation against nation, with\r\ntenfold the power of destruction which belonged to a less educated and\r\nhighly organised age.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _The War and the Church_, by Charles Gore (Oxford, Mowbray,\r\n1914).]\r\n\r\nThe civilised world has been shocked during the past months at the\r\nspectacle of the open adoption by a great Power of this philosophy\r\nof selfishness. Men had not realised that the methods and principles\r\nunderlying so much of our commercial and industrial life could be\r\ntransferred so completely to the field of politics or so ruthlessly pressed\r\nhome by military force. But it is well for us to remember that it is not\r\nPrussia, even in the modern world, who invented the theory of Blood and\r\nIron or the philosophy of Force. The Iron Law of Wages is a generation\r\nolder than Bismarck: and \"Business is Business\" can be no less odious a\r\nwatchword than \"War is War.\" Treitschke and Nietzsche may have furnished\r\nPrussian ambitions with congenial ammunition; but Bentham with his purely\r\nselfish interpretation of human nature and Marx with his doctrine of the\r\nclass-struggle--the high priest of Individualism and the high priest of\r\nSocialism--cannot be acquitted of a similar charge. If the appeal has been\r\nmade in a less crude and brutal form, and if the instrument of domination\r\nhas been commercial and industrial rather than military, it is because\r\nMilitarism is not the besetting sin of the English-speaking peoples. Let\r\nus beware, therefore, at this moment, of anything savouring of\r\nself-righteousness.\r\n\r\n\"Some of us,\" says Bishop Gore, \"see the chief security\" against\r\nthis disease which has infected our civilisation \"in the progress of\r\nDemocracy--the government of the people really by the people and for the\r\npeople. I am one of those who believe this and desire to serve towards the\r\nrealising of this end. But the answer does not satisfy me. I do not know\r\nwhat evils we might find arising from a world of materialistic democracies.\r\nBut I am sure we shall not banish the evil spirits which destroy human\r\nlives and nations and civilisations by any mere change in the methods\r\nof government. Nothing can save civilisation except a new spirit in the\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nThe task before Europe, then, is a double one--a task of development and\r\nconstruction in the region of politics, and of purification and conversion\r\nin the region of the spirit. \"For the finer spirits of Europe,\" says the\r\ngreat French writer, Romain Rolland, who is none the less a patriot because\r\nhe is also a lover of Germany, \"there are two dwelling-places: our earthly\r\nfatherland, and that other, the City of God. Of the one we are the guests,\r\nof the other the builders. To the one let us give our lives and our\r\nfaithful hearts; but neither family, friend, nor fatherland, nor aught that\r\nwe love has power over the spirit which is the light. It is our duty to\r\nrise above tempests and thrust aside the clouds which threaten to obscure\r\nit; to build higher and stronger, dominating the injustice and hatred of\r\nnations, the walls of that city wherein the souls, of the whole world may\r\nassemble.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Article in the _Journal de Genève_, translated in the\r\n_Cambridge Magazine_ and reprinted in _Public Opinion_, Nov. 27, 1914.\r\n\r\nThose who hold that Christianity and war are incompatible would seem to be\r\ncommitted to a monastic and passively anarchist view of life, inconsistent\r\nwith membership in a political society. But whatever the relation between\r\nChristianity and war, there can be no question of the relation between\r\nChristianity and _hatred_. Hatred (which is not the same thing as moral\r\nindignation) is a poison which corrodes and embitters, and so degrades, and\r\nthereby weakens, the national spirit. It is a pity that some of our most\r\nprominent newspaper-proprietors do not understand this.]\r\n\r\nInternationalism as a political theory has broken down: for it was based on\r\na false conception of the nature of government and of the obligations of\r\ncitizenship. The true internationalism--a spirit of mutual understanding\r\nand fellowship between men and nations, to replace the suspicions, the\r\ncompetition, and the watchful selfishness of the past generation--is the\r\nmoral task that lies before Europe and America to-day. If Great Britain is\r\nto lead the way in promoting \"a new spirit between the nations\" she needs a\r\nnew spirit also in the whole range of her corporate life. For what Britain\r\nstands for in the world is, in the long run, what Britain is, and, when\r\nthousands are dying for her, it is more than ever the duty of all of us to\r\ntry to make her worthier of their devotion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL IDEA IN EUROPE, 1789-1914\r\n\r\n  Europe, what of the night?--\r\n    Ask of heaven, and the sea,\r\n    And my babes on the bosom of me,\r\n  Nations of mine, but ungrown.\r\n  There is one who shall surely requite\r\n  All that endure or that err:\r\n  She can answer alone:\r\n    Ask not of me, but of her.\r\n\r\n  Liberty, what of the night?--\r\n    I feel not the red rains fall,\r\n    Hear not the tempest at all,\r\n  Nor thunder in heaven any more.\r\n  All the distance is white\r\n    With the soundless feet of the sun.\r\n  Night, with the woes that it wore,\r\n    Night is over and done.\r\n\r\n            A.C. SWINBURNE, _A Watch in the Night._\r\n\r\nSixty-two years ago reaction reigned supreme in Europe after the great\r\nnational and social uprisings of 1848, and England looked on passively\r\nwhile the hopes of freedom were crushed in Bohemia, Hungary, and Italy.\r\nMazzini, the noblest of Italian patriots, the most prophetic soul among\r\nnineteenth-century nationalists, selected this moment of profound despair\r\nto publish an essay, entitled _Europe, Its Condition and Prospects_, which,\r\nburning with the passion of an inextinguishable faith, pierced the veil of\r\nthe future and foreshadowed in an almost miraculous fashion the situation\r\nwhich faces Europe and England to-day. Nothing printed in this country\r\nsince the war broke out expresses more clearly the real issues of the\r\nmighty conflict and the part our country is called to play in it than the\r\nfollowing words, in reference to the unredeemed peoples of Europe, uttered\r\nby the great Italian more than half a century ago:\r\n\r\n\"They struggled, they still struggle, for country and liberty; for a word\r\ninscribed upon a banner, proclaiming to the world that they also live,\r\nthink, love, and labour for the benefit of all. They speak the same\r\nlanguage, they bear about them the impress of consanguinity, they kneel\r\nbeside the same tombs, they glory in the same tradition; and they demand to\r\nassociate freely, without obstacles, without foreign domination, in order\r\nto elaborate and express their idea, to contribute their stone also to the\r\ngreat pyramid of history. It is something moral which they are seeking;\r\nand this moral something is in fact, even politically speaking, the most\r\nimportant question in the present state of things. It is the organisation\r\nof the European task. In principle, nationality ought to be to humanity\r\nthat which division of labour is in a workshop--the recognised symbol of\r\nassociation; the assertion of the individuality of a human group called by\r\nits geographical position, its traditions, and its language, to fulfill a\r\nspecial function in the European work of civilisation.\r\n\r\n\"The map of Europe has to be re-made. This is the key to the present\r\nmovement; herein lies its initiative. Before acting, the instrument for\r\naction must be organised; before building, the ground must be one's own.\r\nThe social idea cannot be realised under any form whatsoever before this\r\nreorganisation of Europe is effected; before the peoples are free to\r\ninterrogate themselves, to express their vocation, and to assure its\r\naccomplishment by an alliance capable of substituting itself for the\r\nabsolute league which now reigns supreme.\r\n\r\n\"If England persist in maintaining a neutral, passive, selfish part, she\r\nwill have to expiate it. A European transformation is inevitable. When it\r\nshall take place, when the struggle shall burst forth at twenty places at\r\nonce, when the old combat between fact and right is decided, the peoples\r\nwill remember that England stood by, an inert, immovable, sceptical witness\r\nof their sufferings and efforts. The nation must rouse herself and shake\r\noff the torpor of her government. She must learn that we have arrived at\r\none of those supreme moments in which one world is destroyed and another\r\nis to be created; in which, for the sake of others and for her own, it is\r\nnecessary to adopt a new policy.\"\r\n\r\nEngland to-day has adopted this \"new policy\"; she has responded to\r\nMazzini's appeal by stepping into the arena and declaring herself ready to\r\ntake part in \"the organisation of the European task\"; her sons are dying on\r\nthe Continent in defence of the principle of nationality, in support of\r\nthe rights of other nations to that liberty which her insular position has\r\nsecured for herself for many centuries, the liberty \"to associate freely,\r\nwithout obstacles, without foreign domination, in order to elaborate and\r\nexpress their idea.\" She is fighting, moreover, not only on behalf of the\r\nthreatened freedom of Belgium, France, and Serbia, on behalf of the\r\nunborn freedom of Poland, Alsace-Lorraine, and the subject races of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian and Ottoman Empires, but also on her own behalf. It is not\r\nmerely that she recognises that her Empire is in danger; she recognises\r\nalso that she is unable to work out her own salvation, unable to carry on\r\nher industrial development and her schemes for the betterment of her people\r\nin security, while the Continent at her doors remains in constant peril\r\nof change. \"The social idea cannot be realised under any form whatsoever\r\nbefore this reorganisation of Europe is effected.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. _Nation and Nationality_.--The social idea and the national idea have\r\nbeen for a century past the twin pivots of European development. The\r\npolitical structure of the Continent has oscillated this way and that\r\naccording as these ideas have in turn assumed ascendancy over men's minds;\r\nand when, as in 1848, both claimed attention at the same time, the whole\r\nedifice was shaken to its very foundations. In England, on the other hand,\r\nit is the social idea alone which has been a motive force in the nineteenth\r\ncentury, although she has always had to reckon with the national idea\r\nacross the St. George's Channel. Owing to her fortunate geographical\r\nsituation, she acquired national unity many centuries ago and has always\r\nbeen able to defend it successfully against the danger of external\r\naggression. The national idea, therefore, has long ceased to be an\r\naspiration, and consequently a revolutionary force, among us; it has\r\nbeen realised in actual fact, we have grown as accustomed to it and as\r\nunconscious of it as of the air we breathe. Thus Englishmen, as their\r\nattitude towards Ireland has shown, find it difficult to understand exactly\r\nwhat the principle of nationality means to those who have never possessed\r\nnational freedom or are in constant danger of losing it. This is perhaps\r\nespecially true of the English working classes, who grew to the full\r\nstature of political consciousness some fifty years after the last serious\r\nthreat to our national existence was made by Napoleon, and upon whom the\r\nburden of the social idea presses with peculiar weight. And yet, unless\r\nthe significance of the principle of nationality and the part which it has\r\nplayed in the history of modern Europe be realised, it is impossible to\r\nenter fully into the true meaning of the present tremendous conflict.\r\n\r\nWhat then is nationality? The question is more difficult to answer than\r\nappears at first sight. A nationality is not quite the same thing as a\r\nnation. For example, there is a German nation, ruled by the Kaiser\r\nWilhelm II., but this does not include twelve million people of German\r\nnationality who are the subjects of the Emperor of Austria; or again,\r\nthere is the Swiss nation, which is made up of no less than three distinct\r\nnationalities. Still less are the terms state and nationality synonymous;\r\nfor, if they were, then the natives of India might claim to be of the same\r\nnationality as ourselves, or, _vice versa_, the United States would be\r\nregarded as part of the British Empire because a large proportion of their\r\ninhabitants happen to be of British descent. The word \"race\" brings us\r\nsomewhat nearer to the point, but even this will not satisfy us when we\r\nremember that the Slavonic race, for example, consists of a large number of\r\nnationalities, such as the Russians, the Poles, the Czechs, the Serbs, the\r\nMontenegrins, etc., or that the English (as distinguished from the other\r\nthree nations of the United Kingdom) belong to the same Teutonic race as\r\nthe Germans. Nevertheless, a belief, whether well grounded or not, in\r\na common racial origin is one of the root principles of the idea of\r\nnationality.\r\n\r\n\"What is a nation?\" the great Magyar nationalist, Kossuth, asked a Serb\r\nrepresentative at the Hungarian Diet of 1848. The reply was: \"A race\r\nwhich possesses its own language, customs, and culture, and enough\r\nself-consciousness to preserve them.\" \"A nation must also have its own\r\ngovernment,\" objected Kossuth. \"We do not go so far,\" explained his\r\ninterlocutor; \"one nation can live under several different governments, and\r\nagain several nations can form a single state.\"[1] Both the Magyar and the\r\nSerb wore right, though the latter was speaking of \"nationality\" and the\r\nformer of \"nation.\" The conversation is in fact instructive in more\r\nways than one. It would be difficult to find a better definition of\r\n_nationality_ than that given by the Serb speaker. A common language, a\r\ncommon culture, and common customs: these are the outward and visible signs\r\nwhich make a people conscious of its common race, which make it, in other\r\nwords, a nationality.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: R.W. Seton-Watson, _The Southern Slav Question_, p. 46.]\r\n\r\nThe element of \"consciousness\" is all-important. There are, for example,\r\nmembers of the Finnish race scattered all over northern Russia, but they\r\nevince no consciousness of any kind that they are allied to the nationality\r\nwhich inhabits the country of Finland. Again, it is only within recent\r\nyears that the Serbs and the Croats in the south-west corner of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Empire have begun to realise that the only things\r\nwhich divide them one from the other are a difference of religion and a\r\ndifference of alphabet; and now that the realisation of this fact has\r\nspread from the study to the market-place, we see the formation of a new\r\nnationality, that of the Serbo-Croats. The researches of historians and\r\nother learned men have done an immense deal to stimulate the development of\r\nnationalities during the past century, but they are unable of themselves\r\nto create them. The fact of kinship is not enough; community of language,\r\ncustoms, and culture is not even enough; to be a real nationality a people\r\nmust be conscious of all these things, and not merely conscious, but\r\nsufficiently conscious to preserve them and, if need be, to die for them.\r\n\r\nNow the interesting thing for us about a nationality is that it is always\r\nstriving to become a _nation_. A nation, as we have seen, may be composed\r\nof several nationalities; but such cases are rare, and are due to peculiar\r\ngeographical conditions, as for example in Switzerland and Great Britain,\r\nor to external pressure, as in Belgium, which have as it were welded\r\ntogether the different racial elements into a single whole. In general,\r\ntherefore, a nation is simply a nationality which has acquired\r\nself-government; it is nationality _plus_ State. \"Ireland a nation,\" the\r\nwarcry of the Irish Nationalist party, is a claim, not a statement of\r\nfact; Ireland will become a nation when its desire for self-government\r\nis satisfied. The case is instructive because it shows that it is not\r\nnecessary for a nationality to become a _sovereign_ State in order to be in\r\nthe full sense of the word a nation. It is perfectly possible, as our Serb\r\nremarked, for several nations to form a single sovereign state; but as a\r\ngeneral rule all such nations will be allowed to manage their own internal\r\naffairs. The self-governing Dominions of the British Empire and the Magyars\r\nof Hungary are nations, though they are subordinate to their respective\r\nimperial governments in questions of peace and war, treaty obligations,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe real test of national existence is ultimately a sentimental one. Does\r\nthe nationality inhabiting a given country regard the government under\r\nwhich it lives as a true expression of its peculiar genius and will? Does\r\nthe State, of which it forms a part, exist by its consent, or has it been\r\nimposed upon it by some alien authority or nationality? Is it a territorial\r\nunity, or has it been split up into sections by artificial frontiers? All\r\nthese questions must be answered before we can say of any nationality that\r\nit is also a nation. The \"national idea,\" therefore, which has been one of\r\nthe chief factors in modern history, is essentially an idea of development.\r\nIts root is the conception of nationality, that is of a people consciously\r\nunited by race, language, and culture; and from this springs the larger\r\nconception of nationhood, that is of a nationality possessing its own\r\npolitical institutions, governed by its own consent, and co-extensive with\r\nits natural boundaries. As we shall see later, political development\r\ndoes not always stop at the Nation-State. Further growth, however, is\r\nextra-national in character; it may either take the parasitical form of one\r\nnation imposing its will and its \"culture\" upon other nations, or it may\r\nassume the proportions of that highest type of polity yet known to mankind,\r\na commonwealth of nations freely associating together within the confines\r\nof a single sovereign State.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Chapter IX. for further treatment of this.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§2. _The Birth of Nationalism: Poland and the French Revolution_.--With\r\nthese general principles in mind let us now consider the national idea at\r\nwork in the nineteenth century. Nations, in the sense just defined, have\r\nof course long existed in Europe. England, Scotland, and Switzerland are\r\nnations whose life-histories date right back to the Middle Ages. Joan of\r\nAre was a nationalist, and France has been a nation since the end of the\r\nHundred Years' War in 1453. Spain became a nation a few years later by the\r\nexpulsion of the Moors and the union of Castille and Aragon under Ferdinand\r\nand Isabella. Holland, again, acquired her national freedom in her great\r\nstruggle against Spain in the sixteenth century. But it was not until the\r\nend of the eighteenth century that nationalism became a real force in\r\nEurope, an idea for which men died and in whose name monarchies were\r\noverthrown. \"In the old European system,\" writes Lord Acton, \"the rights of\r\nnationalities were neither recognised by governments nor asserted by the\r\npeople. The interest of the reigning families, not those of the nations,\r\nregulated the frontiers, and the administration was conducted generally\r\nwithout any reference to popular desires. Where all liberties were\r\nsuppressed, the claims of national independence were necessarily ignored,\r\nand a princess, in the words of Fénelon, carried a monarchy in her wedding\r\nportion.\"[1] The State was, in short, regarded as a purely territorial\r\naffair; it was the property, the _landed_ property, of the monarch, who in\r\nhis capacity of owner controlled the destinies of the people who happened\r\nto live upon that territory. Conquest or marriage might unite in the hands\r\nof a single monarch the most diverse peoples and countries, the notorious\r\ncase of the kind being that of the Emperor Charles V., who in the sixteenth\r\ncentury managed to hold sway over Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Naples,\r\nand a large part of the New World.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _History of Freedom_, p. 273.]\r\n\r\nThe golden age of the dynastic principle was, however, the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and the long and tedious wars of that period were nearly all\r\noccasioned by the aggrandisement of some royal house. The idea of a nation\r\nas a living organism, as something more than a collection of people\r\ndwelling in the same country, speaking the same language and obeying\r\nthe same ruler, had not yet dawned upon the world. Apart from England,\r\nScotland, Switzerland, and Holland, no European nation had really become\r\nconscious of its personality as distinct from that of its hereditary\r\nmonarch. And as we have seen, until nationality becomes keenly\r\nself-conscious, the national idea remains unborn. Only some great internal\r\ncataclysm or an overwhelming disaster inflicted by a foreign power could\r\nevoke this consciousness in a nation; and fate ordained that the two\r\nmethods should be tried simultaneously at opposite ends of Europe. France,\r\n\"standing on the top of golden hours,\" and Poland, crushed, dismembered,\r\ndowntrodden--it would be difficult to say which of these contributed the\r\nmore to the great national awakening in Europe.\r\n\r\nPoland was the first and greatest martyr of the nationalist faith. By its\r\nconstitution, which was that of an oligarchical republic with an elective\r\nking, Poland was placed beyond the pale of a Europe ruled upon dynastic\r\nprinciples. Its very existence was an insult to the accepted ideals\r\nof legitimacy and hereditary monarchy, and it was impossible for any\r\nparticular house to acquire it in the honest way of marriage. This was\r\nparticularly annoying to its immediate neighbours, Prussia, Russia, and\r\nAustria, all of whom had grown into great powers while Poland, torn by\r\ninternal dissension, sank lower and lower in the political scale. It is\r\nsignificant that the earliest suggestion of partition came from Frederick\r\nthe Great of Prussia, who was obliged to take Russia and Austria into his\r\ncounsels, as he knew that they would never allow him to annex the whole\r\ncountry himself. Indeed, from first to last, the story of the Polish\r\npartitions is a good example of Prussian _Realpolitik_. At length, after\r\nmuch hesitation on the part of Russia and Austria, the Powers agreed among\r\nthemselves in 1772 to what is known as the First Partition, whereby the\r\nthree monarchs enriched their respective territories by peeling, as it\r\nwere, the unfortunate republic on all its frontiers. Perhaps the most\r\nremarkable fact about the whole disgraceful concern is that it did not\r\nappear in the least disgraceful, either morally or politically, to the\r\npublic opinion of the age. Meanwhile Poland by a heroic effort converted\r\nherself in self-defence into a hereditary constitutional monarchy on the\r\nmodel of England. Prussia, playing the part of Judas, pretended to welcome\r\nthese reforms at first and lent the Poles its encouragement; but when\r\nRussia took up arms on behalf of the Polish reactionary party, and the\r\ncountry turned to Prussia to aid it in defending the constitution, the\r\ntreacherous Frederick William not only declined to do so, but began to\r\nsend his troops to occupy Polish territory. The upshot was the further\r\ndismemberment of Poland known as the Second Partition (1793). \"No sophistry\r\nin the world,\" writes Mr. Nisbet Bain, \"can extenuate the villainy of the\r\nSecond Partition. The theft of territory is its least offensive feature. It\r\nis the forcible suppression of a national movement of reform, the hurling\r\nback into the abyss of anarchy and corruption of a people who, by\r\nincredible efforts and sacrifices, had struggled back to liberty and order,\r\nwhich makes this great political crime so wholly infamous. Yet here again\r\nthe methods of the Russian Empress were less vile than those of the\r\nPrussian King. Catherine openly took the risk of a bandit who attacks an\r\nenemy against whom he has a grudge; Frederick William II. came up, when the\r\nfight was over, to help pillage a victim whom he had sworn to defend.\"[1]\r\nAfter this the end came rapidly. The heroic patriot Kosciuszko headed a\r\npopular rising against Russia; but after a remarkable resistance to the\r\ncombined forces of the three partitioning powers, the insurrection was\r\nfinally suppressed in torrents of blood. The crowned bandits nearly\r\nquarrelled between themselves over the booty, but eventually in 1795\r\nAustria, Russia, and Prussia signed a treaty which left nothing of Poland\r\non the map at all.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Slavonic Europe_, p. 404.]\r\n\r\nThe effect upon the subsequent history of the world of this crime against\r\nhumanity, carried out by the three most absolute dynasties in Europe, was\r\nincalculable. \"The annihilation of the Polish nationality has probably\r\ndone more to endanger the monarchies of Europe than any one political act\r\naccomplished since the monarchies of Europe were first founded. To trace\r\nits effects in all their various ramifications would lead us a long way.\r\nIt is sufficient here to notice that the destruction of Poland, like the\r\ndestruction of Jerusalem, produced a \"dispersion,\" and that as the Jews\r\nof the dispersion have discharged a peculiar office in the economy of the\r\nworld as usurers and financiers, so, too, have the Poles of the dispersion\r\nas agents and vectors of revolution. In all the republican movements of the\r\nContinent the Poles have taken a leading part. They are to be found in\r\nthe Saxon riots of '48; in the Berlin barricades; in the struggle for the\r\nRepublic in Baden; in the Italian and Hungarian wars of liberation; in\r\nthe Chartist movement, and in the French Commune. Homeless and fearless,\r\nschooled in war and made reckless by calamity, they have been the nerve\r\nof revolution wherever they have been scattered by the winds of\r\nmisfortune.\"[1] And what Mr. Fisher, in this passage, puts in a concrete\r\nfashion, Lord Acton has expressed with equal emphasis, if more abstractly.\r\n\"This famous measure,\" he writes of the final partition, \"the most\r\nrevolutionary act of the old absolutism, awakened the theory of nationality\r\nin Europe, converting a dormant right into an aspiration, and a sentiment\r\ninto a political claim. 'No wise or honest man,' wrote Edmund Burke, 'can\r\napprove of that partition, or can contemplate it without prognosticating\r\ngreat mischief from it to all countries at some future date.' Thenceforward\r\nthere was a nation demanding to be united in a State--a soul, as it were,\r\nwandering in search of a body in which to begin life over again; and\r\nfor the first time a cry was heard that the arrangement of States was\r\nunjust--that their limits were unnatural, and that a whole people was\r\ndeprived of its right to constitute an independent community. Before that\r\nclaim could be efficiently asserted against the overwhelming power of its\r\nopponents--before it gained energy, after the last partition, to overcome\r\nthe influence of long habits of submission, and of the contempt which\r\nprevious disorders had brought upon Poland--the ancient European system was\r\nin ruins, and a new world was rising in its place.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _The Republican Tradition in Europe_, pp. 212-213.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _History of Freedom_, p. 276.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Present State Boundaries_--THE PARTITION OF POLAND.]\r\n\r\nThe last sentence reminds us that, while in the East the dynastic principle\r\nwas displaying with cynical indifference its true character to the world,\r\nevents were occurring in the West which threatened to shake its very\r\nfoundations. If Poland was the first martyr of the national idea,\r\nRevolutionary France was its first evangelist, for the new gospel which\r\nFrance preached was the gospel of Liberty, and nationalism is an extension,\r\na variant of this gospel. In France itself, at the time of the\r\nRevolution, the doctrine of Liberty was interpreted in its individual and\r\nconstitutional sense, which involved the abolition of class privileges\r\nand of political institutions that conflicted with or did not adequately\r\nexpress what Rousseau called the \"general will.\" There was no national\r\nquestion to be settled in France, and she could therefore devote herself\r\nexclusively to the development of the \"social idea,\" the establishment of\r\ndemocratic government, the foundation of a republic, and in general the\r\ndetermination of what should be the relations between the individual and\r\nthe State, a question which in course of time led on to the problem of\r\nSocialism.\r\n\r\nBut indirectly the French Revolution did an enormous deal to promote the\r\nnational idea in Europe. In the first place, the execution of Louis XVI.\r\nand the proclamation of the Republic administered a blow to the theory of\r\nlegitimacy upon which the dynastic principle rested, from which it never\r\nrecovered. If the French nation could rise and abolish its native dynasty,\r\nwas there not hope that some day the Italian, Hungarian, and Polish nations\r\nmight also rise and throw off the still more objectionable yoke of their\r\nforeign rulers? In the second place, the Revolution in and for itself\r\nproduced a tremendous effect upon the rest of Europe, and in every country\r\nmen awoke from the long sleep of feudalism to the desire of sweeping away\r\nantiquated constitutions and rebuilding them upon a democratic basis.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, sufficient to glance at a map of Europe at the end of the\r\neighteenth century to see why these dreams could not be at once realised.\r\nOf what real value were ideals of democratic reform to the peoples dwelling\r\nin Italy, Germany, or the Austrian Empire? Look, for example, at Germany,\r\nsplit up like a jig-saw puzzle into over three hundred different States,\r\neach with its petty prince or grand-duke. Her poets and philosophers might\r\nsing of liberty and dream Utopian dreams, and here and there an experiment\r\nin popular government might be tried by some princeling who had caught\r\nthe liberal fashion; but her political fabric, together with the rivalry\r\nbetween Prussia and Austria, kept her disunited and strangled all real\r\nhopes of reform. In short, the first and most crying need of Europe was not\r\nthe abolition of antiquated constitutions, but the redrawing of anomalous\r\nfrontiers.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the sovereignty of the people proclaimed in France\r\npresupposed the doctrine of the solidarity of the people proclaimed by the\r\ndismembered nations of Europe. France could set its house in order; but\r\nBelgium, Germany, Italy, Bohemia, Hungary, etc., had as yet no house of\r\ntheir own. The house had to be built before it could be furnished on the\r\nlatest democratic lines; and before it could be even built, the ground had\r\nto be wrested from the hands of absentee landlords or cleared of the little\r\ndynastic State-shanties which cumbered it. The Polish nationalists became\r\nthe backbone of the republican movement in Europe; the French republicans\r\nproclaimed the independence of nations as one of their cardinal principles.\r\nThus the social idea and the national idea were originally intimately\r\nconnected. They were the twin children of Poland and the French Revolution,\r\nand in their cradle it was hard to tell them apart, so strongly were the\r\nfeatures of each stamped with the likeness of Liberty.\r\n\r\nFor a time it seemed that the new ideas would carry all before them. Even\r\nbefore France had herself abolished the monarchy, Belgium threw off the\r\nAustrian rule and declared for a republic. And when in 1792 France found\r\nherself at war with the Austrian and Prussian governments, and in the\r\nfollowing year with practically all the governments of Europe, her\r\nvictorious armies were everywhere greeted as saviours by the subject\r\npeoples. But the old dynastic states proved to be of tougher material than\r\nwas expected. Moreover, it was not long before France found herself in\r\nconflict with the national aspirations which she had called into existence.\r\nThe various republics which France set up all over Europe soon discovered\r\nthat they were nothing but tributary states of their \"deliverer\"; and when\r\nNapoleon began his career of undisguised conquest, he unwittingly did even\r\nmore than the Revolution to strengthen the national idea in Europe, for the\r\nnationalities had now become thoroughly hostile to France and fought in\r\nalliance with their old dynasties to throw off the yoke of the hated\r\nforeign tyrant.\r\n\r\nThis strange change in France from liberator to despot is worthy of some\r\nattention. It is not good for a nation, any more than for an individual,\r\nto be too successful. Moreover, the doctrine of liberty, whether in the\r\nindividualist or nationalist sense, if carried to extreme, is liable to\r\nabuse. All to-day are aware that sheer individualism in the economic sphere\r\nis an almost unmitigated evil; sheer individualism in the political sphere\r\nand sheer nationalism are equally evil. France at the beginning of last\r\ncentury was suffering from too much success, too much political liberty,\r\ntoo much nationalism. Having overthrown the old _régime_ within the State\r\nquickly and easily, she began to think she could do without the State\r\naltogether: the result was anarchy, for which the only remedy is despotism.\r\nHaving, again, suddenly become conscious of her power and mission as a\r\nnation, she began to send her armies across her frontiers to carry the\r\ngospel of her peculiar \"culture\" to other and more benighted nations: the\r\nresult was occupation, which degenerated into conquest. Despotism within\r\nand conquest without, both being summed up in the one word Napoleon--such\r\nwas the fate of the Mother of Liberty, who had loved her child \"not\r\nwisely but too well.\" Yet Napoleonism was a very necessary stage in the\r\ndevelopment of modern Europe. It was the tramp of the invader which\r\ndid more than anything else to awake sleeping nationalism all over the\r\nContinent; it was before the roar of Napoleon's cannon that the artificial\r\nboundaries which had divided peoples crumbled to dust. Napoleon cleared the\r\nground, and even did something toward laying the foundations of the great\r\nmodern Nation-States, Germany and Italy. What Napoleon did for Europe at\r\nthe beginning of the nineteenth century, Germany, the Napoleon-State among\r\nnations to-day, is doing for Europe at the beginning of the twentieth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\n§3. _The Congress of Vienna and the International Idea_.--The overthrow of\r\nNapoleon was due in a large measure to the spirit of nationalism which his\r\nconquests had evoked against him among the various peoples of Europe; the\r\nrewards of that overthrow, however, were reaped not by the peoples, but by\r\nthe dynasties and State-systems of the old _régime_. The Congress of the\r\nPowers which met at Vienna in 1814 to resettle the map of Europe, after\r\nthe upheavals and wars of the previous twenty-five years, was a terrible\r\ndisappointment; and we, who are now hopefully looking forward to a similar\r\nCongress at the end of the present war, cannot do better than study the\r\ngreat failure of 1814, and take warning from it. The phrases which heralded\r\nthe approaching Congress were curiously and disquietingly similar to those\r\non the lips of our public men and journalists to-day when they speak of\r\nthe \"settlement\" before us. \"The Parliament of Man, the Federation of the\r\nWorld,\" which had become a remote dream when Tennyson first coined the\r\nexpression in 1842, seemed in 1814 on the eve of accomplishment. The work\r\nof the Congress was to be no less than \"the reconstruction of the moral\r\norder,\" \"the regeneration of the political system of Europe,\" the\r\nestablishment of \"an enduring peace founded on a just redistribution\r\nof political forces,\" the institution of an effective and a permanent\r\ninternational tribunal, the encouragement of the growth of representative\r\ninstitutions, and, last but not least, an arrangement between the Powers\r\nfor a gradual and systematic disarmament. \"It seemed,\" writes Sir A.W.\r\nWard, \"as if the states composing the European family, free once more to\r\ntake counsel together on terms of independence, were also free to determine\r\ntheir own destinies.\"[1] The Congress of Vienna was to inaugurate a\r\nNew Era. Such of these views, however, as pointed in a democratic or\r\nnationalistic direction represented the expectations of the peoples,\r\nnot the intentions of the crowned heads and diplomatists who met at the\r\nAustrian capital. Among the members of the Congress the only man who at\r\nfirst voiced these aspirations of the world at large was the Russian Tsar,\r\nAlexander I., and such concessions to popular opinion as were made were due\r\nto what the English plenipotentiary, Lord Castlereagh, described as the\r\n\"sublime mysticism and nonsense\" of the Emperor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Cambridge Modern History_, vol. ix. p. 577.]\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of establishing a new era, the Congress did its utmost\r\nto restore the old one. Everything which had happened in Europe since\r\nthe outbreak of the French Revolution was regarded as a bad dream, the\r\nprinciples of popular freedom and national liberty were completely ignored,\r\nand an attempt was made to rivet again on the limbs of Europe the shackles\r\nof the antiquated frontiers which had been struck off by the hammer of\r\nNapoleon. Everywhere the \"national idea\" was trampled upon. Germany and\r\nItaly were put back again into the eighteenth century, Austria's territory\r\nin the latter country being largely increased; Norway was unwillingly yoked\r\nwith Sweden, and Belgium with Holland; Switzerland was made to surrender\r\nher democratic constitution and to return to the aristocratic cantonal\r\nsystem of the past; and, lastly, Poland remained dismembered.\r\n\r\nThe Allies, while fighting Napoleon, had issued the following proclamation\r\nto the world, couched in language almost identical with that used by the\r\nAllies who are now fighting Germany: \"Nations will henceforth respect their\r\nmutual independence; no political edifices shall henceforth be erected on\r\nthe ruins of formerly independent States; the object of the war, and of the\r\npeace, is to secure the rights, the freedom, and the independence of\r\nall nations.\"[1] The Congress of Vienna failed to redeem these pledges:\r\nfirstly, because its members had not grasped the principle of nationality,\r\nand used \"nation\" and \"State\" as if they were synonymous terms; secondly,\r\nbecause they did not represent the peoples whose destinies they took it\r\nupon them to determine, and made no attempt whatever to consult the\r\nviews of the various masses of population which they parcelled out among\r\nthemselves like so much butter. They honestly tried to lay the foundations\r\nof a permanent peace; but their method of doing so was not to satisfy the\r\nnatural aspirations of the European nations and so leave them nothing to\r\nfight about, but to establish such an exact equipoise among the great\r\nStates, by a nice distribution of the aforesaid butter in their respective\r\nscales, that they would be afraid to go to war with each other, lest they\r\nmight upset the so-called \"balance of power.\" The \"settlement\" of 1814,\r\ntherefore, left a heritage of future trouble behind it which has kept\r\nEurope disturbed throughout the nineteenth century, and is directly\r\nresponsible for the present war. The real settlement is yet to come; and if\r\nwe of this generation are to make it a final one we must avoid the errors\r\ncommitted by the Congress of a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Alison Phillips, _Modern Europe_, p. 8.]\r\n\r\nYet, when all is said, the Congress of Vienna represents an important\r\nmilestone along the road of progress. It is a great precedent. As a\r\ndisillusioned contemporary admitted, it \"prepared the world for a more\r\ncomplete political structure; if ever the powers should meet again to\r\nestablish a political system by which wars of conquest would be rendered\r\nimpossible and the rights of all guaranteed, the Congress of Vienna, as\r\na preparatory assembly, will not have been without use.\"[1] There is a\r\nprophetic ring about this, very welcome to us of the twentieth century.\r\nWe cannot think altogether unkindly of our great-grandfathers' ill-judged\r\nattempt to avert the calamity which has now broken over us.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Friedrich von Gentz, quoted in _Camb. Mod. Hist._ vol. x. p.\r\n2.]\r\n\r\nNor was the Congress altogether barren of positive result; for it gave\r\nbirth to that conception of a \"Confederation of Europe,\" which, though\r\nnever realised, has been one of the guiding ideas of nineteenth-century\r\npolitics. As this solution of the world's problems is likely to be urged\r\nupon us with great insistency at the conclusion of the present war, it will\r\nbe well to look a little more closely into it and to see why it failed to\r\nsecure the allegiance of Europe a hundred years ago. The Congress had met\r\nat Vienna and settled all outstanding questions, to the satisfaction of\r\nits members; why should it not meet periodically, and constitute itself\r\na supreme international tribunal? The question had only to be asked to\r\nreceive the approbation of all concerned. The dreamer, Alexander I., at\r\nonce saw the destinies of the world entrusted to a Holy Alliance, which\r\nwould rule according to \"the sacred principles of the Christian religion\";\r\nand even the more practical mind of Castlereagh conceived that a council of\r\nthe great powers, \"endowed with the efficiency and almost the simplicity of\r\na single State,\" was a possibility.\r\n\r\nYet, it is quite clear to-day that, at that time and under those\r\nconditions, the establishment of a permanent and effective Confederation of\r\nEurope would have proved disastrous to the world. The Congress of Vienna\r\nwas followed by further congresses in 1818, 1819, 1820, and 1822; and each\r\nsucceeding conference revealed to Europe more clearly the true character\r\nof the new authority into whose hands the power was slipping. Certain very\r\ndangerous tendencies became, for example, apparent. The first conference\r\nhad assembled to confer the blessings of order upon a continent ravaged by\r\nthe revolutionary and Napoleonic wars of France. Hence the Confederation of\r\nEurope started life as a kind of anti-Jacobin society, whose main business\r\nit was to suppress revolution, whether it took the nationalistic or\r\ndemocratic form. Furthermore, the interference with the internal affairs of\r\nFrance in 1814 and 1815 tended to establish a precedent for interference\r\nwith the internal affairs of any country. The Holy Alliance, therefore,\r\nsoon assumed the character of a \"Trust\" of absolute monarchs, determined\r\nto aid each other when threatened by risings or agitations among their\r\npeoples, and to crush liberal aspirations wherever they were to be found in\r\nother parts of Europe. The popular desire for peace was exploited in the\r\ninterests of unpopular government; settlement by conference in regard\r\nto international matters was extended to settlement by a cabal of\r\nirresponsible crowned heads in regard to internal constitutional and\r\nnational questions; a clique of despots threatened the liberties of the\r\nworld and proposed to back up their decisions by using their armies as\r\npolice. One government, however, even in that period of reaction, refused\r\nto lend its countenance to such proceedings. England at first protested and\r\nat length took up an attitude of complete opposition, and it is due to her\r\nthat the Confederation never became really effective. She had to choose\r\nbetween peace and liberty, and she chose the latter.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Alison Phillips, _The Confederation of Europe_, together\r\nwith his chapter on \"The Congresses, 1815-1822\" in vol. x. of the\r\n_Cambridge Modern History_. The whole subject of the Concert of Europe,\r\nwhich can only be touched upon here, is of great importance. It is again\r\nreferred to in Chap. VIII.; see pp. 374 ff.]\r\n\r\nThe truth is that there were three ideas in the air at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century, all excellent in themselves, but quite impossible to be\r\nrealised at one and the same period. Two of these, the social or democratic\r\nidea and the national idea, were made, as we have seen, living issues by\r\nthe French Revolution; the third, which may be called the international\r\nidea, was raised by the Congress of Vienna. It was an old idea, of course,\r\nfor it had been embodied in that shadowy \"Holy Roman Empire\" which was the\r\nmedieval dream of Rome the Great; but its form was new, and now for the\r\nfirst time it became a dream of the future rather than a dream of the past.\r\nWhat men did not see then, and still for the most part fail to see, is that\r\nthe human race can only work out these three ideas properly in a certain\r\norder. Democracy and nationhood may, as in the case of Italy, be acquired\r\nby a people at the same moment; but without the realisation of the national\r\nidea it is hardly possible to conceive of democratic government for any\r\ncountry. The national idea, therefore, precedes the social idea, as Mazzini\r\nrightly insists. Still more must it precede the international idea. By\r\nthis it is not meant that every nation in the world must have grown to\r\nself-consciousness and have possessed itself of freedom before we come\r\nwithin sight of a world-concert and world-peace. But certainly in Europe\r\nitself the national question had to be settled before there could be any\r\nchance of establishing an international tribunal. It is equally certain\r\nthat the social idea also claims preference of the international idea. The\r\ngreat danger of setting up \"an effective machine for regulating the affairs\r\nof Europe\" is that the machine may get into the wrong hands. The Holy\r\nAlliance is a warning, which should not be forgotten. It became an\r\nobstruction to progress, a strait-waistcoat which threatened to strangle\r\nthe liberties of Europe, because it got into the hands of a \"vested\r\ninterest,\" the dynastic interest, which was hostile both to nationalism and\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nSince 1814, however, there have been great strides along the paths both of\r\ndemocracy and of nationalism. And if Germany loses this war, the congress\r\nof the settlement will meet in a very different atmosphere from that in\r\nwhich its predecessor assembled at Vienna. It will be a conference of\r\npowers victorious over Reaction not Revolution, and pledged to the support\r\nof a liberal programme. And yet if such a conference became a permanent\r\nfeature of European life, if, in other words, a new attempt were made to\r\nset up an international tribunal, it might easily become as dangerous to\r\nthe liberties of the people as ever was the Holy Alliance. The dynastic\r\nprinciple it is to be hoped, will never again threaten the world's peace or\r\nprogress; but there are other vested interests besides the dynastic one.\r\nDuring the nineteenth century economic development has given an enormous\r\nimpetus to international movements and cosmopolitanism generally.\r\nUnfortunately political development, though great, has not by any means\r\nkept pace with the economic; in other words, it is still possible in most\r\ncountries, and in some more possible than in others, for a small oligarchy\r\nto gain control of the political machine.\r\n\r\nAgain, if there is one thing in the world more international than Labour,\r\nit is Capital; and, as Mr. Norman Angell has shown, it is the capitalist\r\nwho is hardest hit by international war and who stands to gain most from\r\nits abolition. European capital is almost certain to have a large say in\r\nthe settlement, and considerable influence in the counsels of any new\r\nConcert of Europe that might come into existence. Now suppose--a not\r\nimpossible contingency--that a ring of capitalists gained complete control\r\nof some politically backward country like Russia, and suppose a grave\r\ncrisis arose in the Labour world in England or France, what would be easier\r\nthan for arrangements to be made at the international conference for the\r\ntransference of Russian troops to the west, \"to preserve the sacred rights\r\nof property and the peace of Europe\"? This may seem a somewhat fantastic\r\nsupposition, yet it was precisely in this way and on grounds like these\r\nthat the Holy Alliance interfered with the internal affairs of European\r\ncountries during the second and third decade of last century, and even as\r\nlate as 1849 we have Russia, still faithful to the principles of thirty\r\nyears before, coming to the assistance of Austria in her suppression of the\r\nliberties of Hungary. It was a healthy instinct in the English people that\r\nled them to break up the Concert of Europe in 1818--\"a system which not\r\nonly threatened the liberties of others, but might, in the language of\r\nthe orators of the Opposition, in time present the spectacle of Cossacks\r\nencamped in Hyde Park to overawe the House of Commons\";[1] and, if the\r\nprevailing \"internationalism\" has not quite blinded their eyes to-day,\r\nthey will scrutinise with the greatest possible care any new proposals to\r\nre-erect the Concert of Europe as a permanent and authoritative tribunal.\r\nWhat the world needs at present is more nationalism and more democracy. And\r\nit is only after these two great nineteenth-century movements have worked\r\nthemselves out to the full, at least on the continent of Europe, that\r\nmankind will be able safely to make experiments towards the realisation of\r\nthe third and crowning principle, the principle of a European Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Cambridge Modern History_, vol. x. p. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUROPE IN 1815]\r\n\r\nThe national problems which the Congress of Vienna bequeathed to posterity\r\nmay be seen at a glance by looking at a political map of Europe in 1815.\r\nThe entire centre of the Continent from Ostend to Palermo, and from\r\nKönigsberg to Constantinople, was left a political chaos. And it is not too\r\nmuch to say that the history of Europe from 1814 to 1914 is the history of\r\nthe settlement of this vast area. The only State whose frontiers have not\r\naltered during this period is Switzerland, and even that country seized the\r\nopportunity which a disturbed Europe offered her in 1848, to substitute a\r\nunified federal system for the constitution imposed upon her in 1815.\r\nThe rest of the area falls into six sections: (1) The kingdom of the\r\nNetherlands, containing the two distinct and often antagonistic nations,\r\nBelgium and Holland; (2) the German nationality split up into no less\r\nthan thirty-eight[2] sovereign States, loosely held together in a\r\n\"confederation\"; (3) the Italian nationality, distributed under eight\r\nindependent governments, including four duchies, two kingdoms, the Papal\r\nStates, and the provinces under Austrian rule; (4) the Polish nationality,\r\ndivided up between the three Powers, Prussia, Russia, and Austria; (5) the\r\nAustrian Empire, comprising a dozen distinct nationalities; and (6) the\r\nOttoman Empire, in which at least five different Christian peoples groaned\r\nbeneath the sway of the Mohammedan Turk. Thus, if we may regard the\r\ninhabitants of the southern Netherland provinces, for the moment, as of one\r\nnationality, there were roughly ten great nationalities, the Germans, the\r\nItalians, the Belgians, the Poles, the Bohemians, the Hungarians, the\r\nSouthern Slavs, the Rumanians, the Bulgarians, and the Greeks, all left\r\nwith national aspirations unsatisfied, all hampered by State frontiers\r\nwhich had no correspondence with their natural boundaries. Can we wonder\r\nthat there have been wars in the nineteenth century? Should we not rather\r\nwonder that those wars have not been greater and more numerous? For the\r\nCongress of the Powers in 1814 having failed to give the nationalities what\r\nthey wanted, nothing remained for them but to seize it for themselves. The\r\nonly alternative to settlement by conference is \"blood and iron,\" and it\r\nis with \"blood and iron\" that nearly every nationality which has attained\r\nnationhood in the last hundred years has cemented the structure of its\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Napoleon had succeeded in reducing the number from 360 to 38.]\r\n\r\nIt is not our purpose in the present chapter to deal with the whole of this\r\nvast area; the three eastern sections, Poland, the Austrian Empire, and\r\nTurkey, present special problems of their own, and therefore need special\r\ntreatment. Still less do we intend to write a history of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, or even to adhere to a chronological treatment. Rather our object\r\nis to exemplify the principle of nationality by watching it at work in\r\nthe three western sections of the central European area; to show how the\r\nnational idea has been moulded in Belgium, Italy, and Germany, by the\r\nvarious problems which the nationalities in these countries have had to\r\nface, and the forces which they have overcome; and, lastly, to indicate the\r\npart which an over-developed nationalism in Germany has played in bringing\r\nabout the war of 1914.\r\n\r\n\r\n§4. _The National Idea in Belgium and the Problem of Small Nations_.--The\r\nproblem of the Netherlands, which it will be convenient to deal with first,\r\nintroduces us to an aspect of nationhood which we have hitherto not touched\r\nupon. \"The chief forces which hold a community together and cause it\r\nto constitute one state,\" wrote Sir John Seeley, \"are three,--common\r\nnationality, common religion, and common interest. These may act in various\r\ndegrees of intensity, and they may also act singly or in combination.\"[1]\r\nIn the Low Countries religion has up to the present been a stronger\r\nnation-making force than nationality. Three nationalities, each with its\r\nown language, live there side by side,--the Dutch, the Flemings, and the\r\nWalloons; but of these the Dutch and the Flemings are very closely allied\r\nracially, Flemish being only a slight variant of the Dutch language. It\r\nwould therefore seem natural on the face of it that these two sections\r\nwould amalgamate together, leaving the Walloons to attach themselves\r\nto their French cousins. That it is not so is due to the fact that the\r\nFlemings and the Dutch are adherents of two different and mutually hostile\r\ncreeds, and that this distinction in their faith has been stamped upon\r\nthe national memories by the whole history of their past. Holland, the\r\nstronghold of Calvinism, had at the end of the sixteenth century thrown off\r\nthe yoke of Catholic Spain and asserted its independence, while the Belgic\r\nprovinces, after Alva had cruelly crushed out such Protestantism as existed\r\namong their peoples, returned to the faith and the allegiance of their\r\nfathers, and remained part of the Hapsburg inheritance until the Congress\r\nof Vienna. Thus the cleavage between Protestantism and Catholicism has made\r\ntwo nations out of one Low German nationality in the Netherlands, as it\r\nthreatens to do with one Celtic nationality in Ireland. On the other hand,\r\ntheir common Catholic faith has welded Flemings and Walloons together,\r\nmaking one nation out of two nationalities far more racially distinct than\r\nthe Flemings and the Dutch, and this amalgamation has acquired a certain\r\nflavour of common nationality from the fact that the language of the upper\r\nclasses is French.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Expansion of England_, p. 59.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious therefore that the attempt of the diplomatists in 1814 to\r\nignore both historical and religious differences and to combine Holland\r\nand Belgium into a single State was doomed at the outset. Fifteen years of\r\nconstant friction were followed in 1830 by a rising in Brussels against\r\n\"Dutch supremacy,\" which quickly spread to the rest of Belgium. The Great\r\nPowers, recognising the inevitable, interfered on behalf of Belgium, she\r\nwas declared a neutral State, separate from Holland, and took to herself a\r\nking in the person of Leopold I. It is, however, highly significant that\r\ndirectly the Dutch menace was removed from Belgium the internal cleavage of\r\nnationality began to be felt. \"In 1815 the differences between Flemish and\r\nWalloon were to a large extent concealed beneath a veneer of French culture\r\nand French manners. Among the upper and commercial classes no language but\r\nFrench was ever spoken; and in their dislike of Dutch supremacy the Flemish\r\nBelgians took a sort of patriotic pride in their borrowed speech, and for a\r\ntime relegated their native tongue to the level of a rustic _patois_.\"[1]\r\nAnd yet, on the other hand, \"the separation of Belgium from Holland had no\r\nsooner taken place than the newly aroused national spirit began to show\r\nitself among the Flemish-speaking part of the people by a revival of\r\ninterest in their ancestral Teutonic language.... King William I.'s attempt\r\nto make Dutch the official language had met with universal opposition; but\r\nas early as 1840 a demand was put forward for the use of the Flemish tongue\r\n(which is closely akin to the Dutch) on equal terms with French in the\r\nLegislature, the Law Courts, and the Army. As the years passed by, the\r\nmovement gathered ever-increasing numbers of adherents, and the demand was\r\nrepeated with growing insistence.\"[2] In 1897 the Flemish party attained\r\nits ambition, and Flemish became the official language of the country, side\r\nby side with French. The remarkable thing about this Teutonising movement\r\nis that its mainstay has always been the extreme Catholic party, which\r\non religious grounds had been the most violent opponent of the attempted\r\nTeutonification by the Dutch. The opposition between Flemish and Walloon,\r\nindeed, became so marked in recent years that many feared that the Belgian\r\nnation was about to split into two. Germany has, however, postponed this\r\nnational calamity for generations if not for ever, and the Belgium\r\nwhich arises like a phoenix from the ashes of this third attempt at\r\nTeutonification will, we cannot doubt, be a Belgium indissolubly knit\r\ntogether by common memories of a glorious struggle for freedom and cemented\r\nby the blood and tears of the whole population. Germany, like Napoleon a\r\ncentury ago, will call many nations into being; the first and not the least\r\nof her creations is a transfigured and united Belgium.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Cambridge Modern History_, vol. x. p. 521.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_. vol. xi. p. 693.]\r\n\r\nAs a frontier State, a link between the Latin and Teutonic races to both of\r\nwhich her peoples are akin, Belgium offers an extremely interesting study\r\nof the national idea at work. The peoples of Germany and France, which have\r\nbeen perpetually at war with each other since the times of Julius Caesar,\r\nhave almost always met on her fair and prosperous plains to fight their\r\nbattles, since she is geographically the gateway from one to the other.\r\nNeither could afford to let the other occupy her territory, and so she\r\nhas won her independence as a State; both have constantly threatened her\r\nexistence in times past, and so have forced upon her bi-lingual population\r\nthat consciousness of common interests which if strong enough may become as\r\nfirm a basis for national unity as actual community of nationality.\r\n\r\nIt should be noticed further that it has become the practice in recent\r\ntimes to guarantee the neutrality of small frontier States like Belgium\r\nwhich lie at the mercy of their greater neighbours, a practice intended\r\nnot only to preserve the integrity of such States but also to prevent\r\nthe frequent occurrence of war by closing, as it were, the military gate\r\nbetween the hostile countries.[1] It remains to be seen whether the\r\nviolation of these principles by Germany has the effect of strengthening\r\nthem in the future, rather than the reverse. In any case, we may expect to\r\nsee attempts to apply the same principles to other parts of Europe. Already\r\nthe northern and southern ends of the frontier between Germany and France\r\nare neutralised by the existence of Belgium and Switzerland; why, it may\r\nbe asked, should not the whole frontier be treated in the same way by\r\nneutralising the disputed territory of Alsace-Lorraine? Perhaps, too, a\r\nneutral Poland would form a useful buffer between Germany and Russia. Such\r\nneutralisation, it should be noted, need not necessarily carry with it\r\nindependence. Poland and Alsace-Lorraine might form part of Russia and\r\nFrance respectively, and still be neutralised by a guarantee of other\r\npowers. A precedent exists for this in the terms of the cession of the\r\nIonian Islands to Greece in 1864, while Savoy, though a province of France,\r\nis technically neutralised territory.[2] Cases like these, however, it must\r\nbe admitted, are extremely anomalous and could hardly stand the strain of\r\na serious war. But, then, as recent experience has shown us, not even\r\nindependent neutralised States are safe when all Europe is aflame. The\r\ntruth is that the whole conception of neutrality implies the existence of\r\nsome power above and beyond the State, it may be simply a group of powerful\r\nStates who are able to impose their will upon the rest of Europe, it may\r\nbe a general Congress, like the Congress of Vienna. Since the Concert of\r\nEurope disappeared and gradually gave place to the two opposing alliances\r\nof great powers, there has been no such authority in the civilised world.\r\nThe results are before us in the ruined cities and starving population of\r\nviolated Belgium.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The neutralisation of sovereign States is very recent in\r\norigin. Switzerland and Luxembourg are the only other instances. The former\r\nwas neutralised in 1815, the latter in 1867.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Cambridge Modern History_, xi. 642. See for the whole\r\nquestion of neutralised States, Lawrence, _Principles of International\r\nLaw_, §§ 246-248.]\r\n\r\nAs independent States, therefore, small nations can only survive, in\r\nthe long run, if their neutrality is permanently guaranteed by some\r\ninternational authority, which is itself permanently capable of enforcing\r\nits decrees upon recalcitrant States. Sovereignty and independence,\r\nhowever, are not, as we have seen, essential to full nationhood, provided\r\nthe nation possesses a certain amount of \"home-rule\" and regards the\r\ngovernment under which it lives as a true expression of its genius and\r\nwill. For example, from 1809 till the setting in of Russian reaction in\r\n1899, the Finnish nation enjoyed all the privileges of complete nationhood\r\nexcept actual sovereignty. There is, therefore, a future for small nations,\r\neither as autonomous protégés of great powers, like Russia, or as partners\r\nin some commonwealth of nations, like the British Empire.\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another consideration to be faced. Why, it is asked,\r\nshould we trouble ourselves about the preservation of small nationalities\r\nat all? \"The State is power,\" and it is only the really powerful State,\r\ntherefore, that can and ought to survive. There is something laughable in\r\nthe idea of a small State; it is weakness trying to pose as strength. And\r\nas for nations which have lost their independence and have bowed to the\r\nyoke of the conqueror, their fate is incorporation. How can they hope or\r\nexpect to retain their separate existence and their peculiar culture when\r\nthey have surrendered the power upon which these privileges depend? \"No\r\nnation can permit the Jews to have a double nationality\"; and the same\r\napplies to Poles, Finns, Alsatians, Irishmen, and Belgians.[1] This is the\r\npoint of view of Bernhardi, Treitschke, and the German Government. This\r\nis the theory which is said to justify the practice of Prussianisation,\r\nRussianisation, Magyarisation, and so on. It raises the whole question\r\nof the value and significance to civilisation of the existence of small\r\nnations. Treitschke, of course, and his school are convinced that they\r\npossess neither value nor significance. In small States there is developed\r\nthat beggarly frame of mind which judges the State by the taxes that it\r\nraises; there is completely lacking in small States the ability of the\r\ngreat State to be just; all real masterpieces of poetry and art arose upon\r\nthe soil of great nationalities--such are a few of Treitschke's dogmatic\r\nutterances on this subject.[2] But it is not merely the Germans who think\r\nsmall beer of small nationalities. Listen to Sir John Seeley: \"The question\r\nwhether large states or small states are best is not one which can be\r\nanswered or ought to be discussed absolutely. We often hear abstract\r\npanegyrics upon the happiness of small states. But observe that a small\r\nstate among small states is one thing, and a small state among large states\r\nquite another. Nothing is more delightful to read of than the bright days\r\nof Athens and Florence, but those bright days lasted only so long as the\r\nstates with which Athens and Florence had to do were states on a similar\r\nscale of magnitude. Both states sank at once as soon as large country\r\nstates of consolidated strength grew up in their neighbourhood. The lustre\r\nof Athens grew pale as soon as Macedonia arose, and Charles V. speedily\r\nbrought to an end the great days of Florence. Now if it be true that a\r\nlarger type of state than any hitherto known is springing up in the world,\r\nis not this a serious consideration for those states which rise only to the\r\nold level of magnitude?\"[3] The answer to which is, \"Yes, indeed, if\r\n                                            the good old plan\r\n             That he should take who has the power,\r\n             And he should keep who can\r\n\r\nis to be the guiding principle in European politics of the future.\" But\r\nsurely Sir John Seeley's argument, though undoubtedly telling as regards\r\nthe sovereign independence of small _States_, tells for and not against the\r\npreservation of small _nations_. Was it to the interest of the world as a\r\nwhole that Athens and Florence should be crushed? Is it not true, in spite\r\nof Treitschke, that the great things of earth have been the product of\r\nsmall peoples? We owe our conceptions of law to a city called Rome, our\r\nfinest output of literature and art to small communities like Athens,\r\nFlorence, Holland, and Elizabethan England, our religion to an\r\ninsignificant people who inhabited a narrow strip of land in the Eastern\r\nMediterranean. And small nations are as valuable to the world to-day as\r\nthey have ever been. Denmark has enriched our educational experience by the\r\nestablishment of her famous high schools, which we can hardly imagine her\r\ndoing had she been a province of Prussia; Norway has given us the greatest\r\nof modern dramatists, Henrik Ibsen; and Belgium has not only produced\r\nMaeterlinck and Verhaeren, but is industrially the most highly developed\r\ncountry on the continent. The world cannot afford to do without her small\r\npeoples, who must be either independent or autonomous if they are to find\r\nadequate expression for their national genius, if they are to obtain proper\r\nconditions in which \"to live, think, love, and labour for the benefit of\r\nall.\" Can we guarantee to them this freedom? That is one of the great\r\nquestions which this war will settle.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See _Selections from Treitschke_, translated by A.L. Gowans,\r\npp. 17-20, 58-61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See _Selections from Treitschke_, pp. 17-20, 58-61.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _The Expansion of England_, p. 349.

Robertson, _Introduction to English Politics_, pp.\r\n251-390; Mr. H.A.L. Fisher's pamphlet on _The Value of Small States_, in\r\nwhich, however, the distinction between _states_ and _nations_ is not\r\nmade clear; and the article on \"Nationalism and Liberalism\" in _The Round\r\nTable_, December 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§5. _The National Idea in Italy: The Ideal Type_.--Let us now turn to\r\nItaly, a country which has in the past been as much of a European Tom\r\nTiddler's ground as Belgium, though for rather different reasons. Italy\r\nis inhabited by a race speaking a common language and observing a common\r\nreligion, she has historical memories as glorious as those of any other\r\ncountry in the world, and her natural boundaries are almost as well-defined\r\nas those of Great Britain; yet it was not until the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century that she managed to become a nation. The chief reason\r\nwhy she remained a \"geographical expression\" long after England, France,\r\nand Spain had acquired national unity was the fact that she was until\r\ncomparatively recent times an example of the less containing the greater.\r\nThroughout the Middle Ages she was a suburb, not a country. Rome was the\r\ncapital of the world, Italy only its environs. Moreover, since all roads\r\nlead to Rome, and the lord of Rome was the master of Europe, the roads\r\nRomeward were worn by the tramp of the armies of all nations. Thus Italy\r\nwas constantly subject to invasion, and the state-systems with which the\r\nCongress of Vienna resaddled her in 1814 were little more than relics of\r\npast military occupations of her soil by foreign armies. The main problem,\r\ntherefore, in the making of modern Italy was how to get rid of the heavy\r\nburden of the past, how to deal with Rome and all that Rome stood for.\r\n\r\nThe problem would have been insoluble had not the prestige of Rome declined\r\nconsiderably since the Middle Ages, a prestige which sprang from the fact\r\nthat she was the capital of two Empires--the spiritual Empire of the\r\nPapacy, and the secular Empire founded by Charles the Great. The former had\r\nsuffered from the Reformation and the rise of the great Protestant nations,\r\nthe latter had been growing feebler and feebler for centuries, until it\r\nwas abolished as an institution by Napoleon. Yet Italy in 1814 still lay\r\nhelpless and divided at the feet of Rome. The Pope held under his immediate\r\nsway a large zigzag-shaped territory running across the centre from sea to\r\nsea, and, as spiritual leader of half Europe, he could at any moment summon\r\nto his assistance the Catholic chivalry of the world. \"The Roman emperor\"\r\nno longer existed, but \"the Austrian emperor\" was another title for the\r\nsame man, holding much the same territory; and the fact that he had\r\nrenounced his vague suzerainty over the rest of Europe did not prevent him\r\nexercising a very real suzerainty in Italy, not merely over the eastern\r\nhalf of the Lombard Plain which definitely belonged to Austria, but also\r\nover the other States of the peninsula which were, in theory at least,\r\nindependent. The kingdom of the two Sicilies in the South, the grand duchy\r\nof Tuscany on the West, and the smaller duchies of Parma, Modena, and\r\nLucca were only stable in so far as Austria bolstered up their corrupt and\r\nunpopular governments. Even the Papal States themselves, equally undermined\r\nwith corruption and unpopularity, ultimately rested upon the same support.\r\nThus Austria represented for Italy all that evil past of which she wanted\r\nto be rid: the foreign yoke against which her newly conscious spirit of\r\nnationality revolted, the dynastic frontiers which were abhorrent to her\r\ndesire for unity, the absolute _régime_ under which her soul, after feeding\r\non the principles of the French Revolution, lay gagged and bound. The first\r\nstep to be taken towards the creation of Italy was the expulsion of the\r\nAustrians.\r\n\r\nThis fact in itself purified the struggle for Italian freedom and raised\r\nItalian nationalism to heights of nobility and heroism almost unparalleled\r\nin history. The nation had not merely to be unified, but _delivered_, and\r\ndelivered from the oppression of that power which was the mainstay of\r\nreaction in Europe. Nor was it simply a question of national freedom;\r\nAustria had declared war upon individual and constitutional liberty also,\r\nand used all her power to suppress them wherever they dared to raise their\r\nhead. From beginning to end of her fight for national existence, Italy\r\nnever forgot that she was also fighting for individual liberty, or ceased\r\nto be conscious that the downfall of Austria in Italy would mean the\r\ndownfall of reaction in Europe. The banner which Mazzini raised in 1831 had\r\nthe words \"Unity and Independence\" on the one side and \"Liberty, Equality,\r\nand Humanity\" on the other. Italy was indeed greatly blessed, inasmuch as\r\nin seeking her own deliverance she could not help bursting the bands of\r\nbrass which bound the whole world in captivity.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible here to tell the glorious story of the resurrection\r\nof Italy, or even to say anything of the three heroes at whose hands she\r\nreceived her freedom--Cavour who gave her the service of his brain, Mazzini\r\nwho devoted to her the love and passion of his great heart, and Garibaldi\r\nwho fought for her with the strength of his own right arm. It must suffice\r\nto indicate very briefly the various stages in the development of her\r\nnational idea, and the manner in which she finally realised it. Liberal\r\nprinciples took root in Italy at the time of the French Revolution, and\r\nthe first glimmerings of nationalism were due to Napoleon, who bundled the\r\nprinces out of the peninsula and even for a time exiled the Pope himself.\r\nBut it was constitutional rather than national freedom which seemed most\r\nurgent to the generation which succeeded Napoleon. The Carbonari, as the\r\nearly Italian revolutionaries were called, confined themselves almost\r\nentirely to the demand for a constitution in the various existing States,\r\nand though they eagerly desired the expulsion of Austria, they did so not\r\nbecause she prevented Italian unity, but because she forbade political\r\nreform. Their risings, therefore, local and disunited in character, were\r\nbound to fail; the first fifteen years after the Congress of Vienna were\r\noccupied by a series of attempts to substitute a constitutional for an\r\nabsolute _régime_ in different parts of Italy, attempts which Austria\r\ncrushed with a heavy hand.\r\n\r\nThe period which followed, 1830-1848, belongs to Mazzini and his \"Young\r\nItaly\" party. His task was to fire Italy for the first time with the ideal\r\nof national unity and independence. The conception of unity was a difficult\r\none for Italians to grasp; all history seemed to fight against it. There\r\nwere, for example, not only the traditions connected with Rome to be\r\nreckoned with, but there was also the difference between north and south,\r\nand, perhaps most important of all, the local spirit of independence\r\nassociated with the great cities like Venice, Milan, Florence, Naples, etc.\r\nThus, over against Mazzini's ideal of a single unified State there arose\r\nthe counter-ideal of a federal system. In this, however, later events\r\nproved Mazzini to be right. Where he failed in foresight was in regard to\r\nthe constitutional character of the State he dreamed of. He wished not\r\nonly to abolish all existing frontiers in Italy, but to do away with all\r\nexisting state-systems. The only Italy he could conceive was a republic,\r\nand Italy was not ripe for a republic, which was, for the rest, a form\r\nof government too much bound up with the disruptive traditions of the\r\nCity-States to be acceptable.[1] But if Italy was not to be a republic, she\r\nmust be a monarchy, and where could she find a prince to put at the head of\r\nher united State? Clearly, she would accept no one who was not the declared\r\nenemy of Austria and the declared friend of constitutional reform. For a\r\nmonth or so in 1846 it seemed that the Pope himself might be prevailed upon\r\nto undertake the rôle; and the elevation of Pius IX. to the Chair of St.\r\nPeter was greeted with wild enthusiasm in Italy because he was believed to\r\nbe a Liberal. These hopes proved illusory, however, and so the eyes of all\r\npatriots turned more and more in the direction of Piedmont.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is noticeable that Greece also played with the idea of a\r\nrepublic at first and eventually selected a monarchical form of government.\r\nAs a matter of fact, not a single nation-State, formed in Europe since the\r\nCongress of Vienna, has adopted the republican principle.]\r\n\r\nThis principality, which was part of the kingdom of Sardinia, ruled over\r\nby the semi-French house of Savoy, shared the northern plain of Italy\r\nwith Austria, and at first showed neither anti-Austrian nor Liberal\r\nproclivities. Victor Emmanuel came back smiling in 1814, saying that he had\r\nbeen asleep for fifteen years; the old _régime_ was restored as though\r\nthe Revolution had never been; and a rising of the Carbonari in 1821 was\r\nsuppressed with the aid of Austrian troops. But in 1831 a king, Charles\r\nAlbert, came to the throne, who realised that it was the mission of his\r\nhouse to drive the Austrians from Italy, and who was enlightened enough to\r\nbegin to institute reforms, as unostentatiously as possible, so as not to\r\nattract the unwelcome attention of Vienna. Then came the great outburst\r\nof 1848, which was the culmination of Mazzini's propaganda for the past\r\nsixteen years. At first all went well. The Austrian army was almost\r\nexpelled from the peninsula; constitutions were granted in Rome, Naples,\r\nTuscany, and Piedmont; Venice and Rome declared themselves republics.\r\nBut no real scheme for all Italy emerged; the Mazzinians were heroic but\r\nunpractical; and next year Austria returned once more, dealt as before\r\npiecemeal with the revolted provinces, and finally crushed the hopes of\r\nItaly again at the battle of Novara. Yet all was not lost. The republican\r\ndreams of Mazzini were, it is true, at an end. But Piedmont had stepped\r\ninto Mazzini's shoes; she had championed the cause of freedom against\r\nAustria; and, when the latter reasserted her sway, she alone of the various\r\nStates refused to abrogate the newly-acquired constitution.\r\n\r\nThus began the third period in the emancipation of Italy, the period of\r\nCavour, who became head of the Piedmontese cabinet in 1850. His aim was\r\nfirst to make Piedmont the model State and champion of all Italy. He\r\nbelieved fervently in liberty--\"Italy,\" he said, \"must make herself by\r\nmeans of liberty, or we must give up trying to make her\"--and he was at\r\nthe same time one of the ablest and most practical statesmen who have ever\r\nguided the destinies of a nation. In ten years he made the State of the\r\nnorth-west an oasis of freedom and good government which attracted the best\r\nintellects of Italy to its service, and henceforth Piedmont became the\r\ncentre of Italian aspirations. A new propaganda movement was set on\r\nfoot, called the National Society, which rejected both federalism and\r\nrepublicanism and declared in favour of a united Italy under the crown of\r\nVictor Emmanuel of Savoy; and when the chance of French support came in\r\n1858, Cavour felt it was time to act. This time the end crowned the work.\r\nAustria was deprived of everything but Venice; Tuscany and Romagna declared\r\nfor incorporation by plebiscite; Garibaldi conquered Sicily and the south;\r\nand by the end of 1860 the King of Sardinia was king of practically the\r\nwhole of Italy. All that still remained to be won was Venice, which Austria\r\nceded in 1866; Rome, which the French had occupied in the name of the Pope,\r\nand were forced to evacuate in 1870; and the Italia Irredenta of to-day,\r\nviz. the Trentino, Trieste, and Istria, which may be recovered as a result\r\nof the present war. It is worthy of note also that the trans-Alpine\r\nprovinces, Savoy and Nice, which had been part of the dominions of the\r\nSardinian kingdom, were ceded to France in 1858-1859 as a return for her\r\naid, thus rounding off the western frontier of the new kingdom of Italy so\r\nas to correspond fairly closely with the boundary of nationality.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of modern Italy shows us the \"national idea\" at its best;\r\nit was accomplished by noble means and by noble minds; and the latter, in\r\ntheir perpetual struggle against the forces of reaction, were never allowed\r\nto forget the claims of individual as well as of national freedom. Three\r\ntests of true nationhood, it will be remembered, were suggested at\r\nthe beginning of this chapter: a state-frontier co-extensive with the\r\nnationality-frontier, a unitary state-system, and a form of government\r\nrecognised by the inhabitants as an expression of their general will.\r\nItaly fulfils all these conditions; for, though the first has not yet been\r\nperfectly realised as regards Italia Irredenta, the exception is after\r\nall a trifling one. Thus the development of the national idea in Italy is\r\nalmost a model of what such a development should be, and we have dwelt\r\nsomewhat at length upon it for that very reason. The work of Mazzini and\r\nCavour provides us with a standard of comparison which should be found very\r\nuseful in dealing with the national idea in other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n§6. _The National Idea in Germany: a Case of Arrested\r\nDevelopment_.[1]--Nothing, for example, could be more instructive, both as\r\na study in nationalism and as an aid to the understanding of the present\r\nsituation in Europe, than a comparison between the making of modern Italy\r\nand the making of modern Germany. At first sight the German Empire, with\r\nits marvellous progress, its vast resources, and its world-wide ambitions,\r\nwould appear to be an even more successful example of national development\r\nthan the kingdom of Italy. Its demand for \"a place in the sun,\" its\r\nhustling diplomacy, its military spirit, its obvious intention to expand\r\nterritorially, if not in Europe itself then in Asia or Africa, are all\r\ntaken as symptoms of this success. No doubt there is a certain amount of\r\ntruth in this view. The truculence of German foreign policy is to be partly\r\nattributed to that form of swollen self-consciousness and self-complacency\r\nto which all nations are subject more or less, and which is most likely,\r\none would suppose, to be found in countries where a nationality had\r\nrecently succeeded in making itself into a nation. The natural instinct to\r\nregard one's own nation as the peculiar people of God and to look down on\r\nother nations as \"lesser breeds without the law\" is a phenomenon which must\r\nbe constantly reckoned with in any comprehensive treatment of nationalism.\r\nEvery nation has its own variety of it; in England it is Jingoism, in\r\nFrance Chauvinism, in Italy Irredentism, in Russia Pan-Slavism, and so on.\r\nThese are instances of over-development of the national idea, due either\r\nto some confusion between race and nationality, or to simple national\r\nmegalomania, which usually subsides after a healthy humiliation, such as we\r\nsuffered in England, for example, in the Boer War or as Russia suffered in\r\nher struggle with the Japanese.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The student is advised to read the chapter on Germany before\r\nbeginning this section.]\r\n\r\nYet a careful examination of the German body-politic will reveal symptoms\r\nunlike those to be found in any other nation. German nationalism is\r\nover-developed in one direction because it is under-developed and imperfect\r\nin other directions. Apply our three tests to the German nation, and it\r\nwill be found to fail in them all. National boundary and State frontier do\r\nnot coincide because there are still some twelve million Germans living\r\noutside Germany, in Austria-Hungary;[1] Germany is a State, but not a\r\nunitary State, for she still retains the obsolete \"particularism\" of the\r\neighteenth century, with its petty princes and dynastic frontiers; and\r\nlastly, the government of Germany cannot claim to express the general will,\r\nwhile more than a third of the voters in the empire are sworn to overthrow\r\nthe whole system at the earliest opportunity. The German nation, in\r\nfact, is suffering from some form of arrested development, and arrested\r\ndevelopment, as the criminologists tell us, is almost invariably\r\naccompanied by morbid psychology. That Germany at the present moment, and\r\nfor some time past, has been the victim of a morbid state of mind, few\r\nimpartial observers will deny. It has, however, not been so generally\r\nrecognised that this disease--for it is nothing less--is due not to any\r\nnational depravity but to constitutional and structural defects, which are\r\nthemselves the result of an unfortunate series of historical accidents. Let\r\nus look a little closer into this matter, considering the three defects in\r\nGerman nationalism one by one, and using the story of Italy as an aid to\r\nour investigation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There are also Germans living in Switzerland, the Baltic\r\nProvinces of Russia, and the United States of America; but these may be\r\nregarded as lost to the German nation as the French Canadians are lost to\r\nFrance.]\r\n\r\nFirst, then, why was it that, while the unification of Italy led to the\r\ninclusion of the whole Italian nationality within the State frontiers, with\r\nthe trifling exceptions above referred to, the unification of Germany was\r\nonly brought about, or even made possible, by the _exclusion_ of a large\r\nsection of the nationality? Germany, like Italy, was hampered by traditions\r\ninherited from the mediaeval Roman Empire, represented by an ancient\r\ncapital which stood in the path of unity. Why was it that, while Italy\r\ncould not and would not do without Rome, Germany was compelled to surrender\r\nVienna and to exclude Austria? The answer is: because the unification of\r\nGermany was only possible through the instrumentality of Prussia, which\r\nwould not brook the rivalry of Austria, and therefore the latter had to go.\r\nThe problem of the making of Germany as it presented itself to the mind\r\nof Bismarck was first of all a problem as to which should be _supreme_ in\r\nGermany, Prussia or Austria; in other words Bismarck cared more for the\r\naggrandisement of Prussia than for the unity of Germany.[1] To the mind\r\nof Cavour the problem of the unification of Italy presented itself in\r\na totally different light. For him there was no question of the\r\naggrandisement of Piedmont, though he no doubt felt pride in the thought\r\nthat the House of Savoy was to possess the throne of Italy. Austria was\r\nexpelled from Italy in 1860, not that Piedmont might take her place as\r\nruler of the peninsula, but that Piedmont might disappear in the larger\r\nwhole of an emancipated Italy. Austria was expelled from Germany in 1866 in\r\norder that Prussia might rule undisturbed. Thus, though the Austro-Prussian\r\nWar of 1866 was an essential step in the foundation of the modern German\r\nState, its motives and results were not in the least comparable to those\r\nwhich inspired and followed the Italian War of Liberation in 1859-60. In\r\nthe first place the Austrians were not foreigners but Germans, whom it was\r\nnecessary for reasons of State not of nationality to place outside the rest\r\nof Germany. Germany had, in fact, to choose between national unity and\r\nState unity; and she chose the latter, partly because Prussia really\r\ndecided the matter for her, partly because she realised that the\r\nestablishment of a strong German State was the essential prelude to the\r\ncreation of a strong united nation. Austria had to be shut out in 1866 in\r\norder that she might be received back again at some later date on Germany's\r\nown terms. In the second place Austria was in no sense the oppressor of\r\nGermany as she had been of Italy. She was simply the presiding member of\r\nthe German Confederation who, as the rival of Prussia, as the inheritor of\r\nthe mediaeval imperial tradition, as the ruler of millions of non-Germanic\r\npeople, would have rendered the problem of German unification almost\r\ninsoluble. It was therefore necessary to get rid of her as gently and as\r\npolitely as possible. After the crushing victory at Königgrätz, Bismarck\r\ntreated Prussia's ancient foe with extraordinary leniency; for he had\r\nalready planned the Dual Alliance in his mind; knowing as he did that,\r\nthough in Germany Austria might be an inconvenient rival to Prussia, in\r\nEurope she was the indispensable ally of Germany. And so, though the\r\nramshackle old German imperial castle was divided in two, and the northern\r\nportion, at any rate, brought thoroughly up to date, the neighbours still\r\nlived side by side in a \"semi-detached\" kind of way. It would be a mistake\r\nthen to call the war of 1866 a war of deliverance. Indeed, since the defeat\r\nof Napoleon at Leipzig, Germany has had no such war. That is in a great\r\nmeasure her national tragedy. Italian nationalism was spiritualised by the\r\nvery fact that it had to struggle for decades against a foreign oppressor,\r\nand the foundations of her unity were laid on the heroic memories of her\r\nefforts to expel the intruder. This spiritualisation, these heroic memories\r\nwere Germany's also in 1813-14, but the opportunity of unification was\r\nallowed to slip by, and when the task was performed fifty years later it\r\nwas through quite other means and in a very different spirit. And yet,\r\nthough there was no one to expel, Germany could only hope to attain unity\r\nby fighting. In 1848 she made an attempt to do so by peaceable means, and a\r\nnational Parliament actually assembled at Frankfurt to frame a constitution\r\nfor the whole country. But the attempt, noble as it was in conception,\r\nproved a dismal failure, and it became clear that national unity in Germany\r\nwas to be won \"not by speeches and majority resolutions, but by blood and\r\niron.\" The words are Bismarck's, and the task was his also. Set them beside\r\nthe words of Cavour about Italy and liberty, quoted above, or compare the\r\nharsh unscrupulous spirit of the great German master-builder with the\r\nspirit of Mazzini, Cavour, and Garibaldi, and you get a measure of the\r\ndifference between the developments of the national idea in Germany and in\r\nItaly. Yet Bismarck's famous sentence expressed the truth of the matter for\r\nGermany. Austria had been put outside the German pale, and Germany north of\r\nthe Main had accepted unity under the hegemony of Prussia, but there still\r\nremained the four great States of South Germany to bring in. They had been\r\nthe allies of Austria in 1866, and Prussia, had she willed it, might\r\nhave incorporated them by conquest. But Bismarck saw that they must put\r\nthemselves willingly under Prussia if the German Empire was to be a stable\r\nconcern; he therefore left them alone to think it over for a while. Sooner\r\nor later they would have to come in, since now that Austria had been\r\nexcluded there remained only the choice between dependence on France and\r\nunion with Prussia. Bismarck deliberately played upon South Germany's fear\r\nof France, and Napoleon III's restless foreign policy admirably seconded\r\nhis efforts. But a war was necessary to bring matters to a head. The\r\nopportunity came in 1870, and Bismarck was able to make it appear a war not\r\nof his own choosing. The Southern States threw themselves into the arms of\r\nPrussia; France was crushed, and Alsace-Lorraine annexed; the German Empire\r\nwas proclaimed, and modern Germany came into being. There had been no\r\nforeigner to expel from German soil, but Bismarck found that an attack upon\r\nFrance served his purpose equally well.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Perhaps it would be fairer to say that he was incapable of\r\ndistinguishing between them. See his _Reflections_, i. pp. 315, 316.]\r\n\r\nGermany was made by a war of aggression, resulting in territorial expansion\r\nat the expense of another nation; Italy by a war of liberation, driving\r\nthe alien from her soil. And the subsequent history of the two nations is\r\neloquent of this difference in their origins. Since 1860 Italy has in the\r\nmain occupied herself with domestic reforms, with the working out of the\r\n\"social idea\" which had had to wait upon the realisation of the \"national\r\nidea.\" She has had, it is true, her \"adventures,\" more especially in\r\nAfrica, and her Jingoism, which has taken the natural form of Irredentism\r\nor the demand for the recovery of Italian provinces still left in Austrian\r\nhands; but she has never threatened the peace of Europe, or sought power at\r\nthe expense of other nationalities. Since 1870, on the other hand, Germany\r\nhas had to sit armed to defend the booty taken from France. \"We have earned\r\nin the late war respect, but hardly love,\" said General von Moltke soon\r\nafter the conclusion of peace. \"What we have gained by arms in six months\r\nwe shall have to defend by arms for fifty years.\" At the beginning of 1914\r\nmore than forty out of the fifty years named by Moltke had passed by and\r\nthe situation had undergone no material change. \"The irreconcilability of\r\nFrance,\" writes the late Imperial Chancellor of Germany, \"is a factor that\r\nwe must reckon with in our political calculations. It seems to me weakness\r\nto entertain the hope of a real and sincere reconciliation with France, so\r\nlong as we have no intention of giving up Alsace-Lorraine. And there is no\r\nsuch intention in Germany.\"[1] The annexation of two small provinces has\r\nthus made a permanent breach between two great nations, a breach which has\r\npoisoned the whole of European policy during the past half century, which\r\nhas widened until it has split Europe into two huge armed camps, and\r\nwhich has at last involved the entire world in one of the most terrible\r\ncalamities that mankind has ever known.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Imperial Germany_, von Bülow, p. 69.]\r\n\r\nWhy did Bismarck annex Alsace-Lorraine? To strengthen, he said, the German\r\nfrontier against France. But there was another reason. Fear of France had\r\nbrought the Southern States into the Empire; fear of France should keep\r\nthem there. The permanent hostility of France was necessary to assure the\r\ncontinuance of Prussia's position as the supreme military power in Germany.\r\nAnd so the plundered provinces became the very corner-stone of the German\r\nimperial system. There is surely something very strange about all this. Why\r\nshould it be necessary to retain the loyalty of nearly half Germany by what\r\npractically amounts to terrorisation? The answer is that Germany is not a\r\nsingle national State but a number of _dynastic_ States, federated together\r\nunder the control of one predominant partner. In other words, the problem\r\nof Alsace-Lorraine has led us to the consideration of the second flaw in\r\nthe development of the national idea in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe union of Italy meant a clean sweep of all the old dynastic frontiers\r\nand States which had strangled the country for so long; the union of\r\nGermany, on the contrary, riveted these obsolete chains still more firmly\r\nthan ever on the country's limbs. Bismarck claimed that this was necessary,\r\ninasmuch as the Germans, unlike all other nations, were more alive to\r\ndynastic than to national loyalty; that, in short, Germany was not really\r\nready in 1870 for true unity.[1] The chief reason, however, for the\r\nretention of the old frontiers was that they suited the aims of Prussia.\r\nThe reformers of 1848, as Professor Erich Marcks somewhat naïvely says,\r\n\"had wanted to place Prussia at the head, but only as the servant of the\r\nnation; Prussia was also to cease to be a State by itself, a power on its\r\nown account. She was to create the nation's ideal--complete unity--and then\r\nto merge herself in the nation. But Prussia would not and could not do\r\nthis. She was far too great a power herself; _she could very well rule\r\nGermany, but not serve_.\"[2] Both Germany and Italy at first played with\r\nthe idea of a Confederation, but each was eventually forced to look to one\r\nof its existing States to give it the unity it desired. There was only one\r\npossible choice for each: for Germany, Prussia; for Italy, Piedmont; but\r\nwhile Piedmont was content to serve, Prussia was too proud to do anything\r\nbut rule. The dynastic State frontiers were therefore retained because\r\nPrussia refused to sacrifice her own State frontiers. The \"unification of\r\nGermany,\" in short, was an episode in the gradual expansion of the Prussian\r\ndynastic State, which had begun far away back in the thirteenth century.[3]\r\nIt assumed the air of a national movement, because Prussia cleverly availed\r\nherself of the prevailing nationalistic sentiment for her own ends. The\r\nGerman Empire is therefore something unique in the annals of the world; it\r\nis at once a nation-State, like Italy, France, and Great Britain, and also\r\na military Empire, like Rome under Augustus, Europe under Napoleon, Austria\r\nunder Joseph II., _i.e._ a State in which the territory that commands the\r\narmy holds political sway over the rest of the country. It is not mere\r\naccident of geographical proximity, or even the kinship between Austrians\r\nand Germans, which has led to the long and unshakable alliance of Germany\r\nwith the Hapsburg dominions. They are associated by common political\r\ninterests and by similarity of political structure. Each stands for the\r\nsupremacy of one dynastic State over a number of subordinate States or\r\nnationalities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The chapter entitled \"Dynasties and Stocks\" in the\r\n_Reflections_ should be carefully studied on this point. Bismarck was\r\nobviously uncomfortable about the old frontiers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Lectures on the History of the Nineteenth Century_, p. 104.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See Chap. III. p. 95.]\r\n\r\nHer common nationality leads us to forget that the German Empire should\r\nmore rightly be called the Prussian Empire.[1] Nor is there any reason at\r\nall why the Empire of Prussia should stop its process of expansion at the\r\nnational boundaries; it has indeed already stepped beyond them, into Poland\r\nin the east, into Denmark in the north, into France in the west. Why should\r\nnot the process be carried farther still and Germany become in Europe, nay,\r\nin the world, what Prussia is in Germany? By preserving her identity as\r\na State, and by establishing her hegemony, Prussia, in the name of the\r\nnational idea of Germany, has been able to spread her own ideals throughout\r\nthe Empire, in other words to undertake that Prussianisation of Germany\r\nwhich is the most striking fact in her history since 1870. Piedmont was\r\nswallowed up in Italy, Germany has been swallowed up in Prussia; she has\r\nbecome the sharer of her victories and the accomplice of her crimes. And so\r\nunder the tutelage of the spirit of Bismarck the docile German people have\r\nadopted the Prussian faith; and the policy of aggression and conquest once\r\nentered upon, there was no drawing back. Bismarck fed the youthful nation\r\nupon a diet of blood and iron, and its appetite has grown by what it\r\nfed on. The success of 1870 turned the nation's head; the annexation of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine gave it the first taste of conquest. Germany began to\r\nimagine that German character and German culture possessed some magical\r\nand unique quality which would alone account for this success. Dreams of a\r\nEuropean Empire, of infinite expansion, of world-power, floated before the\r\nnational consciousness. The German people were no longer content, to use\r\nMazzini's words, \"to elaborate and express their idea, to contribute their\r\nstone also to the pyramid of history\"; they now craved to impose their\r\nidea upon the world at large, and to place their stone on the top of the\r\npyramid. Modern Germany is an example of nationalism \"gone wrong,\" just as\r\nNapoleon was an example of democratic individualism \"gone wrong.\" The Man\r\nof Destiny has been followed by the Nation of Destiny, the \"super-man\" by\r\nthe \"super-nation.\" Both have had to face a world in arms arrayed against\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: German writers are fond of calling it \"Prussia-Germany\"\r\n(_Preussen-Deutschland_), a phrase of Treitschke's.]\r\n\r\nThus the national idea in Germany has been cramped, contorted, and\r\nperverted by the Prussian system and the dynastic frontiers. Had the dreams\r\nof 1848 been realised, there might have been no Franco-German War, no\r\nAlsace-Lorraine question, no war of 1914. And what of our third test of\r\nnationhood? Do the people of Germany feel that their government adequately\r\nexpresses their general will, that it is truly representative, by which is\r\nnot necessarily meant that it is democratic in form?[1] There is no\r\ndoubt that in 1848 the educated classes of Germany did actually desire a\r\ndemocratic form of polity. In that year Germany was as liberal as Italy;\r\nshe also had risings in almost every State, not excluding Prussia itself,\r\nwhich were everywhere answered with promises of a \"constitution.\" But when\r\nreaction came in Germany, as in Italy, Prussia did not, like Piedmont,\r\nstand out for freedom and make itself the model State of Germany; on\r\nthe contrary she reverted to her old military absolutism at the first\r\nopportunity. And so the dreams of German liberty, like the dreams of\r\ncomplete German unity, disappeared before the stern necessity of accepting\r\nthe supremacy of a politically reactionary State; and the Prussianisation\r\nwhich followed did much to neutralise altogether the liberalising\r\ninfluences of the south. It is therefore possible to maintain that the\r\npolitical institutions of Germany have come to represent more and more the\r\ngenius and will of the population. \"The Germany of the twentieth century,\"\r\nmaintains a recent writer, \"is not two but one. The currents have mingled\r\ntheir waters, and the Prussian torrent now has the depth and volume of the\r\nwhole main-stream of German thought.\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _e.g._ Russia has a representative government in this sense,\r\nthough she is without \"representative institutions\" in the democratic\r\nsense.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Round Table_, Sept. 1914, p. 628.]\r\n\r\nIt may be so; it may be that the Germany of Goethe, Schiller, and Beethoven\r\nhas been absorbed by the Germany of Bismarck, Moltke, and Roon; but it\r\nmust not be forgotten at the same time that, since their day, yet another\r\nGermany has come into being, the Germany of Marx, Engels, and Bebel, a\r\nGermany which is represented by more than a third of the voters in the\r\nEmpire. The old line of cleavage had barely closed up when a new and much\r\nmore fundamental schism appeared in the State, that between imperialism and\r\nsocial democracy. The existence of this tremendous revolutionary force in\r\nGermany, determined to overthrow the militarist _régime_ of Prussia and to\r\nre-establish the State on a democratic basis, is an unanswerable proof\r\nthat the government of the Empire is not in any true sense representative.\r\nPrussia has in this direction also impeded the development of the national\r\nidea and given mechanical unity at the expense of spiritual unity. It has\r\ncreated a vast political party of irreconcilables in the country, men\r\nwho have been led to feel that they have neither part nor promise in the\r\nnational life, and who therefore elect to stand outside it. \"Our Social\r\nDemocratic party,\" writes von Bülow, \"lacks a national basis. It will have\r\nnothing to do with German patriotic memories which bear a monarchical\r\nand military character. It is not like the French and Italian parties, a\r\nprecipitate of the process of national historical development, but since\r\nits beginning it has been in determined opposition to our past history as a\r\nnation. It has placed itself outside our national life.\"[1] And again: \"In\r\nthe German Empire, Prussia is the leading State. The Social Democratic\r\nparty is the antithesis of the Prussian state.\"[2] Nevertheless, the\r\nImperial Government, not finding it possible to suppress the social\r\ndemocrats, does its best to employ them for its own ends. It uses them\r\nin fact as it uses irreconcilable France, namely, for the purpose of\r\nterrorisation, since it has discovered that the spectre of socialism is as\r\neffective to keep the middle classes loyal as the spectre of French\r\nrevenge is to keep the Southern States loyal. But it also hopes in time to\r\neradicate socialism from the State. \"A vigorous national policy\" Prince\r\nvon Bülow declares to be \"the true remedy against the Social Democratic\r\nMovement\"; and though he makes no specific mention of war, it is obvious\r\nthat a war like that in which Germany is at present engaged is the most\r\nvigorous form a national policy could possibly take. Was the outbreak of\r\nwar last August in part occasioned by the desire on the side of the German\r\nGovernment to win over the workers of Germany? If so, it had yet another\r\nspectre ready to its hand for the purpose--the spectre of Russia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Imperial Germany_, p. 184.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_. p. 186.]\r\n\r\nIn any case, with Germany in this condition, Europe could hardly have\r\navoided a great war at some time or other; and 1914 follows naturally,\r\nalmost inevitably, from 1870. The unification of 1870 was far from\r\ncomplete. The German national idea still awaits development in the\r\ndirection of racial unity, political unity, and constitutional freedom. It\r\nis Prussia that bars the way in all these directions, Prussia, which, in\r\nitself not a nation but a military bureaucracy, a survival of the old\r\nterritorial dynastic principle which the world has largely outgrown, has\r\nstamped its character and system upon the German people. \"Prussia,\" says\r\none of its apologists, \"has put an iron girdle round the whole of German\r\nlife.\"[1] But in the end life proves itself stronger than iron bands.\r\nGermany was bound to make another attempt to reach complete nationhood. She\r\nis doing so now. Prussia fights for conquest, for world-power, and makes\r\ndocile Germany imagine that she is fighting for these also; but what\r\nGermany is really fighting for, blindly and gropingly, is freedom and\r\nunity. She has indeed \"to hack her way through.\" But it is not, as she\r\nsupposes, hostile Europe which hems her in and keeps her from her \"place in\r\nthe sun\"; it is the Prussian girdle and the Prussian chains which hamper\r\nthe free movements of her limbs and hold her close prisoner in the shadow\r\nof the Hohenzollern castle. The overthrow of Prussia means the release of\r\nGermany; and France, who gave Germany greatness in 1870, may with the help\r\nof the Allies be able in the near future to give her an even greater gift,\r\nthe gift of liberty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Lectures on the History of the Nineteenth Century_, p. 106.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§7. _The Map of Europe, 1814-1914_.--We have now watched the national idea\r\nat work in the three western countries of that Central European area which\r\nthe Congress of Vienna left unsettled in 1814, and in a later chapter\r\nwe shall see the same principle acting in the two great divisions of\r\nSouth-East Europe, Austria-Hungary and the Balkan Peninsula. Let us, then,\r\nuse this opportunity to pause for a moment, take a general survey of the\r\nmap, and consider in broad outline what has actually been accomplished\r\nduring the past century and what still remains to do.\r\n\r\nFrom 1814 to 1848, exhausted by the effort of the Revolutionary and\r\nNapoleonic Wars and disillusioned by reactionary statesmanship, the larger\r\nnations slumbered: but Belgium and Greece secured their present liberties,\r\nand outside Europe the national movement spread throughout the South\r\nAmerican Continent. Then came 1848, the \"wonderful year\" of modern history.\r\n\"There is no more remarkable example in history of the contagious quality\r\nof ideas than the sudden spread of revolutionary excitement through\r\nEurope in 1848. In the course of a few weeks the established order seemed\r\neverywhere to be crumbling to pieces. The Revolution began in Palermo,\r\ncrossed the Straits of Messina, and passed in successive waves of\r\nconvulsion through Central Italy to Paris, Vienna, Milan, and Berlin. It\r\nhas often been remarked that the Latin races are of all the peoples of\r\nEurope most prone to revolution; but this proposition did not hold good\r\nin 1848. The Czechs in Bohemia, the Magyars in Hungary, the Germans in\r\nAustria, rose against the paralysing encumbrance of the Hapsburg autocracy.\r\nThe Southern Slavs dreamed of an Illyrian kingdom; the Germans of a united\r\nGermany; the Bohemians of a union of all the Slavonic peoples of Europe.\r\nThe authority of the Austrian Empire, the pivot of the European autocracy,\r\nhad never been so rudely challenged, and if the Crown succeeded in\r\nrecovering its shattered authority it was due to the dumb and unintelligent\r\nloyalty of its Slavonic troops.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: H.A.L. Fisher, _The Republican Tradition in Europe_, p. 193.]\r\n\r\nMany of these risings were doomed to failure, but between 1848 and 1871 the\r\nalien governments in the Italian peninsula were abolished, making way for\r\na unitary government, in the form of a constitutional monarchy, which\r\nembraces with small exceptions the whole of the Italian population of\r\nEurope. In 1871, after three successful wars in seven years against\r\nDenmark, Austria, and France, a Federal Government was established in\r\nGermany, with the kingdom of Prussia as its leading State and the King of\r\nPrussia as its monarch, with the title of German Emperor. This was a step\r\nforward, though the new Germany was neither a unitary nor a constitutional\r\nState. The Austrian territories have also come in for their share of the\r\ngeneral ferment, and Francis Joseph came to the throne in 1848 amid the\r\nuprisings of his subject peoples; but these were successfully tided over,\r\nthough the Hungarian portion of the Austrian dominion achieved national\r\nrecognition and institutions in 1867.\r\n\r\nAfter 1871 the national movement moved farther east. In 1878 Roumania and\r\nSerbia, both national States, were declared sovereign powers independent\r\nof Turkey; Bulgaria achieved its recognition as a principality; and\r\nMontenegro, a small mountain community, which had never submitted to the\r\nTurks, increased its territory and became a recognised European State.\r\nIn 1908 and 1910 Bulgaria and Montenegro became kingdoms like their\r\nneighbours; and in 1913, after the two Balkan Wars, all the five Balkan\r\nStates--Roumania, Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Montenegro--obtained\r\naccession of territory, and the principality of Albania was constituted\r\nout of the Albanian portion of the old Turkish dominion. Finally, in quite\r\nanother region of Europe, Norway, which had been joined in an anomalous\r\nunion with Sweden since 1814, satisfied her national aspirations unopposed\r\nby becoming an independent Constitutional Monarchy in 1905.\r\n\r\nAll this represents a considerable clearing up of the Central European\r\nproblem. Nevertheless, much still remains to be done. Poland is as she was\r\nin 1814, a dismembered nation. The Czechs of Bohemia, the Roumanians of\r\nTransylvania, and the Southern Slavs, not to mention other and smaller\r\nsubject races, continue to demand their freedom from the joint tyranny of\r\nVienna and Budapest. Russia has not yet solved the problem of Finland, nor\r\nEngland the problem of Ireland. The Turk still occupies Constantinople. And\r\nfinally, the Prussianised nationalism of Germany has created new questions\r\nof nationality in Alsace-Lorraine and Schleswig. All these problems\r\ntogether were as so much tinder ready to take fire directly the spark fell.\r\nThey were the cause of the \"armed peace\" of the past forty-three years;\r\nthey are the cause of the war to-day. The conflagration of 1914 is a proof\r\nof a profound dissatisfaction among civilised nations with the existing\r\npolitical structure of the Continent. Alsatians, Poles, Czechs, Finns,\r\nSerbo-Croats, Roumanians, and the rest \"still struggle for country and\r\nliberty; for a word inscribed upon a banner, proclaiming to the world\r\nthat they also live, think, love, and labour for the benefit of all.\" The\r\nframework of society does not fit the facts of nationality, and so the\r\nframework has gone to pieces. \"The map of Europe has to be re-made. That is\r\nthe key to the present movement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nI. NATIONALITY\r\n\r\nMAZZINI. _Essays_.

They employ philosophical\r\nreasonings to explain what is the least philosophic thing in the world,\r\nrespect for force and the fear which transforms that respect into\r\nadmiration.\"--MADAME DE STAËL (1810).\r\n\r\n\"Greatness and weakness are both inseparable from the race whose powerful\r\nand turbid thought rolls on--the largest stream of music and poetry at\r\nwhich Europe comes to drink.\"--ROMAIN ROLLAND (_Jean Christophe_).\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. _The German State_.--The German Nation is one of the oldest in Europe:\r\nthe German State is almost the youngest--of the great States quite the\r\nyoungest.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen sometimes wonder why there are so many Royal princes in\r\nGermany--why it is that when a vacant throne has to be filled, or a husband\r\nto be found for a princess of royal standing, Germany seems to provide\r\nsuch an inexhaustible choice. The reason is that Germany consisted, until\r\nrecently, not of one State but of a multitude of States, each of which had\r\na court and a dynasty and sovereign prerogatives of its own. In 1789, at\r\nthe outbreak of the French Revolution, there were 360 of these States of\r\nevery sort and size and variety. Some were Kingdoms, like Prussia, some\r\nwere Electorates, like Hanover (under our English George III.), some were\r\nGrand Duchies, some were Bishoprics, some were Free Cities, and some\r\nwere simply feudal estates in which, owing to the absence of a central\r\nauthority, noble families had risen to the rank of independent powers.\r\nThese families were the descendants of those \"robber-barons\" whose castles\r\non the Rhine and all over South and West Germany the tourist finds so\r\npicturesque. Prince William of Wied, the first Prince of Albania, is a\r\nmember of one of them, and is thus entitled to rank with the royalties of\r\nEurope: the father-in-law of ex-King Manoel of Portugal, the Prince of\r\nHohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a branch of the Kaiser's own family, is another\r\nfamiliar recent instance. And every one remembers Prince Albert of\r\nSaxe-Coburg-Gotha, the husband of Queen Victoria.\r\n\r\nIn 1789 the possibility of a German National State was so remote that\r\nGermans had not even begun to dream of one. Each little Principality was\r\njealously tenacious of its local rights, or, as we should say, of its\r\nvested interests, as against the common interests of Germany. Most of\r\nthem were narrow and parochial in their outlook; and the others, the\r\nmore broad-minded, were not national but cosmopolitan in spirit. To the\r\ntradition of municipal thinking, which had lasted on uninterruptedly in the\r\nFree Cities of Germany from the Middle Ages, Germany owes the excellence of\r\nher municipal government to-day. To the broad and tolerant humanism of\r\nher more enlightened courts, such as Weimar and Brunswick, we owe the\r\ninfluences that shaped the work of Goethe and of Lessing, two of the\r\ngreatest figures in European thought and letters.\r\n\r\nInto these peaceful haunts of culture and parochialism Napoleon, with the\r\narmies and the ideas of Revolutionary France, swept like a whirlwind,\r\nbreaking up the old settled comfortable life of the cities and countryside.\r\nOne of the greatest of German writers, the Jew Heine, has described in a\r\nwonderful passage what the coming of Napoleon meant to the inhabitants of a\r\nlittle German Principality. It is worth transcribing at some length, for\r\nit gives the whole colour and atmosphere of the old local life in Western\r\nGermany, which has not even yet entirely passed away. The speaker is an old\r\nsoldier giving reminiscences of his boyhood:\r\n\r\n\"Our Elector was a fine gentleman, a great lover of the arts, and himself\r\nvery clever with his fingers. He founded the picture gallery at Düsseldorf,\r\nand in the Observatory in that city they still show a very artistic set of\r\nwooden boxes, one inside the other, made by himself in his leisure hours,\r\nof which he had twenty-four every day.\r\n\r\n\"In those days the Princes were not overworked mortals as they are to-day.\r\nTheir crowns sat very firmly on their heads, and at night they just drew\r\ntheir nightcaps over them, and slept in peace, while peacefully at their\r\nfeet slept their peoples; and when these woke up in the morning they said,\r\n'Good morning, Father,' and the Princes replied, 'Good morning, dear\r\nchildren.'\r\n\r\n\"But suddenly there came a change. One morning when we woke up in\r\nDüsseldorf and wanted to say, 'Good morning, Father,' we found our Father\r\ngone, and a kind of stupefaction over the whole city. Everybody felt as\r\nthough they were going to a funeral, and people crept silently to the\r\nmarket-place and read a long proclamation on the door of the City Hall. It\r\nwas grey weather, and yet thin old tailor Kilian stood in his alpaca coat,\r\nwhich he kept for indoor use only, and his blue woollen stockings hung down\r\nso that his miserable little bare legs were visible above them and his thin\r\nlips were trembling, while he murmured the words of the proclamation. A\r\nveteran soldier at his side read somewhat louder, and at every few words a\r\ntear trickled down into his honest white beard. I Stood by him and cried\r\ntoo, and asked him why we were crying. And then he told me: 'The Elector\r\nexpresses you his gratitude'--then he went on reading, and at the words\r\n'for your loyal and trusted obedience, and releases you from your duties,'\r\nhis tears broke out afresh.... While we were reading, the Elector's arms\r\nwere being taken down from the City Hall, the whole place became as\r\nterrifyingly quiet as though there were going to be an eclipse of the sun,\r\nand all the City Councillors went about hanging their heads as though no\r\none had any more use for them...\r\n\r\n\"When I woke up next morning, the sun was shining as usual, drums were\r\nbeating in the streets, and when I came down to breakfast and said\r\ngood-morning to my father I heard how the barber had whispered to him while\r\nhe was shaving him that the new Grand Duke Joachim was to receive the\r\nhomage of his subjects at the City Hall to-day, that he came of a very good\r\nfamily and had been given the Emperor Napoleon's sister in marriage, and\r\nhad really a very good presence, and wore his fine black hair in curls, and\r\nwould shortly enter the city in state and would certainly please all the\r\nladies. Meanwhile, the drumming continued in the street, and I went and\r\nstood outside the door and watched the French troops marching in, those\r\nglorious happy Frenchmen, who marched through the world with songs and\r\nshining sabres, the gay firm-set faces of the Grenadiers, the bear-skins,\r\nthe tricolour cockades, the gleaming bayonets, the merry skilful horsemen,\r\nand the huge great drum-major with his silver-embroidered uniform, who\r\ncould throw his drum-stick with its gilt button up to the first floor, and\r\nhis eyes up even to the girls in the second floor windows. I was pleased\r\nthat we were to have soldiers billeted on us--my mother was not--and I\r\nhurried to the market-place. There everything was quite different now. The\r\nworld looked as if it had had a new coat of paint. A new coat-of-arms was\r\nhanging on the City Hall, the iron railings on the balcony were covered\r\nwith tapestry hangings, French Grenadiers were standing sentry, the old\r\nCity Councillors had put on new faces, and were wearing Sunday clothes, and\r\nlooked at one another in French and said 'Bon jour,' ladies were looking\r\nout of all the windows, curious bystanders and smart soldiers thronged\r\nthe square, and I and the other boys climbed on to the big horse of the\r\nElector's statue and looked down on the gay crowd.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Heine, _Collected Works_, i. 228 (Book _Le Grand_).]\r\n\r\nNapoleon and his French soldiers, \"marching through the world with songs\r\nand shining sabres,\" brought the Germans more than this happy thrill of\r\nexcitement and a supply of new and more elegant princes. They brought them\r\nthat which gave strength to their own right arm--the spirit of Nationality.\r\n\"The soul of the German people,\" says a recent German writer, \"has always\r\nlain very deep down, and has seldom come to the surface to become the\r\nspirit of the time and to inspire the movements of the world. Hardly ever\r\nexcept in times of the deepest adversity has it come to the surface: but\r\nthen it has claimed its rights, or rather, discovered its duties.\"[1]\r\nNapoleon, by humiliating her, laid bare the soul of Germany, as Germany\r\nherself has laid bare the soul of Belgium to-day. His arrogant pretensions\r\nroused the Germans as they had never been roused since the days of the\r\nReformation; while at the same time his attempts to secure the support of\r\nthe bigger German principalities by enlarging them at the expense of the\r\nsmaller, simplified the map and laid the foundations of a United Germany.\r\nThe thinkers and dreamers of Germany, stung at last into a sense of\r\npolitical reality, awoke from their dreams of cosmopolitanism and devoted\r\ntheir powers to the needs of the German nation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Daab's Preface to Paul de Lagarde, _German Faith, German\r\nFatherland, German Culture_, p. vi. (Jena, 1913).]\r\n\r\nThe years between 1806 and 1813, between the disastrous battle of Jena\r\nand the overwhelming victory of Leipzig, are the greatest years in German\r\nhistory. Shaking off the torpor and the prejudices of centuries the German\r\nnation arose and vanquished its oppressors.\r\n\r\nBut with the twilight of that glorious day the bats returned. The defeat of\r\nNapoleon was not only the defeat of French domination but the defeat of the\r\nFrench Revolution, and of the principles of Democracy and Nationality which\r\ninspired it. The unity of spirit which the Germans had achieved on the\r\nbattlefield they were unable to transform after the victory into a unity of\r\ngovernment or institutions. The Congress of Vienna, which redrew the map\r\nof Europe after the Revolutionary wars, did so, not in accordance with\r\nthe principle of nationality or the wishes of the peoples of Europe but\r\naccording to what was called \"legitimacy,\" that is to say, the interests\r\nof the princes. There was only one idealist at the Conference, the Russian\r\nEmperor Alexander, and he was put off with empty phrases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Germany of 1815.]\r\n\r\nFor Germany the result of the Conference was the reestablishment, in\r\nsmaller numbers and with larger units of territory, of the old undemocratic\r\nprincipalities, and of a Confederation embodying their dynastic interests.\r\nSeveral of the larger States, such as Bavaria, Würtemberg, Saxony, and\r\nHanover, which Napoleon had raised to the status of kingdoms, were\r\nconfirmed in their new dignities, and the kingdom of Prussia, the largest\r\nof them all, acquired, out of the debris of the old Archbishopric of\r\nCologne and other small ecclesiastical and temporal States, the important\r\nprovinces of Westphalia and the Rhineland, which have made possible for\r\nher the industrial growth of the last half century. Cologne, Düsseldorf,\r\nElberfeld, Essen, and other great industrial centres of Western Germany\r\nwill next year be celebrating the centenary of their Prussian connection.\r\nBut the chief State in the Confederation and its undisputed head was\r\nAustria, which had for centuries enjoyed the prestige of supremacy over the\r\nGerman States; and it was the Austrian statesman Metternich who was mainly\r\nresponsible for the Vienna settlement.\r\n\r\nThe German Confederation of 1815-1866 went far outside the boundaries of\r\nmodern Germany. It included lands belonging to three non-German monarchs.\r\nThe King of Holland was a member of it in virtue of the Dutch provinces of\r\nLimburg and Luxemburg; the King of Denmark for the Duchies of Schleswig and\r\nHolstein; and the Emperor of Austria (who, then as now, ruled over Hungary,\r\nAustrian Poland, and the Southern Slav provinces) for Bohemia, Moravia, and\r\nGerman-speaking Austria up to and beyond Vienna. The Confederation was in\r\nfact in no sense a national State, and was never intended to be so. It was\r\na loosely knit assortment of principalities and free cities. Germany\r\nwas still broken up and divided in a manner almost inconceivable to the\r\ninhabitants of an old-established unity like Great Britain or France. At\r\nleast five different kinds of money, for instance, were in use in the\r\ndifferent States of the Confederation, and, as stamp-collectors know, the\r\npostal system was bewildering in its complexity. More important was\r\nthe deep gulf between different parts of the country due to religious\r\ndivisions. The Reformation, which left England with a National Church, left\r\nGermany hopelessly divided; and the division between the Protestants in the\r\nnorth and east, and the Catholics in the west and south, is still, half\r\na century after the establishment of the United Empire, a source of\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nYet the Confederation has one undeniable achievement to its credit. It\r\npaved the way for German unity by facilitating the Zollverein, or Customs\r\nUnion, which was extended between 1830 and 1844 to practically all the\r\nGerman States except those under Austrian rule. But the far-reaching\r\nimportance of this development was not at that time appreciated. Western\r\nEurope was tired after the great Napoleonic struggle and was not in a mood\r\nfor big designs. To all outward appearance Germany seemed to have relapsed,\r\nafter the thrill and glamour of the Wars of Liberation, into the stuffy\r\natmosphere of the old eighteenth century life. Only a very patient, a very\r\ndocile, and a very philosophic and law-abiding people would have endured\r\nsuch an anti-climax; and it is these qualities, together with a certain\r\nclumsiness and helplessness due to their complete inexperience of the\r\nresponsibilities of a larger citizenship, which go far to explain the\r\nsubsequent history of Germany.\r\n\r\nBut in the evil days after the Congress of Vienna the _idea_ of German\r\nunity lived on, and formed a constant theme of discussion and speculation,\r\nlike the idea of the unity of Poland and of the Southern Slavs in the\r\npresent generation. The stirring memories of the Great Revolution were like\r\na constant refrain at the back of men's minds all through that dreary time.\r\nIn 1830, when the French established a Liberal Monarchy and the Belgians\r\nfreed themselves from the unwelcome supremacy of Holland, there was much\r\nexcitement throughout Germany. But nothing serious occurred until 1848,\r\nwhen the Liberal and Nationalist movement, which had been gathering force\r\nthroughout the educated classes of Western Europe for a generation, at\r\nlength came to a head. The whole of Germany was in a ferment, a strong\r\nRepublican movement manifested itself, and in almost every one of the many\r\ncapital cities there was a rising with a demand for a free constitution\r\nand parliamentary government, and for the consolidation of German national\r\nunity in accordance with the same democratic ideals. The princes had no\r\nalternative but to give way, and, as a result, local Constitutions were\r\ngranted, and a national Parliament was summoned to meet at Frankfurt, to\r\ndraw up a national German Constitution on democratic lines.\r\n\r\nThe task before the Frankfurt Parliament was similar to that which has\r\nconfronted British statesmen several times during the last century, in\r\nframing the Dominion of Canada, the Commonwealth of Australia, and the\r\nUnion of South Africa--the task of welding a number of separate State\r\ngovernments with the free consent of their populations into a homogeneous\r\nand democratic central authority. But in the case of an old and still\r\nlargely feudal country like Germany the task was infinitely more difficult,\r\nfor it could not be successful without a levelling-up of the political\r\nideals of the backward States, such as Prussia, and the elimination of many\r\nancient associations and dynastic interests. The Frankfurt Constitution did\r\nactually come into being, and it was nobly planned. It guaranteed to every\r\nGerman citizen the rights of civil liberty, equality before the law, and\r\nresponsible parliamentary government, both central and local. But the mind\r\nof the German nation was not yet equal to its new responsibilities. The\r\nFrankfurt Parliament, like the first Russian Duma, was out of touch with\r\nrealities; it wasted precious time on the discussion of abstract questions\r\nof principle, and failed to meet the practical needs of the moment.\r\nWhile it sat and talked, the enthusiasm which had created it gradually\r\nevaporated. Meanwhile the more reactionary States, and the princes whose\r\nprerogatives were endangered, became more and more openly hostile. All\r\nthrough 1849 the Parliament was losing members by defection, and by the end\r\nof the year its influence had sunk to vanishing point.\r\n\r\nThe movement which collapsed thus ignominiously was not a popular agitation\r\nin the English sense of the term: like other movements of its generation it\r\nsprang, not from the people but from the well-to-do, and its strength lay\r\namong the professional and educated classes. The Frankfurt Parliament was\r\na predominantly middle-class assembly: lawyers and professors, always an\r\nimportant element in German national life, were strongly represented in\r\nit and largely responsible for its failure. Its collapse was a bitter\r\ndisappointment, and drove many of its leaders into exile abroad, more\r\nparticularly to the United States, where some of them, such as Carl\r\nSchurz, lived to play a noteworthy part under more democratic political\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nAfter the failure of the Frankfurt Constitution it slowly became clear to\r\nfar-sighted Germans that there was only one way in which German unity could\r\ncome about. If, unlike the separate provinces of Canada and South Africa,\r\nthe German States would not voluntarily sink their identity in a larger\r\nwhole, unity could only come through their acceptance of the supremacy of\r\none of the existing States.\r\n\r\nThere were only two possible candidates for the supremacy, Austria and\r\nPrussia. Austria was still, at that time, as she had been for centuries,\r\nin a position of undisputed headship. But her German policy was always\r\nhampered because she had also to consider her non-German subjects.\r\nPrussia, a younger and more homogeneous State, with a better organised\r\nadministration and a better disciplined people, was preparing to assert\r\nherself. In 1862, at a moment when liberalism was gathering strength in\r\nPrussia, Count Bismarck became chief Minister of the Prussian Crown and\r\nthe dominating force in Prussian policy. Bismarck was a Conservative and a\r\nreactionary, wholly out of sympathy with the ideals of 1848. His immediate\r\nobject was to secure the supremacy of Prussia among the German States.\r\nIn the very first months of his leadership he made it clear, in a famous\r\nsentence, by what methods he hoped to achieve his end. \"The great questions\r\nare to be settled,\" he told the Prussian Diet, with a scornful hit at the\r\nConfederation, \"not by speeches and majority resolutions, but by blood and\r\niron.\"\r\n\r\nHe was not long in translating words into action. In 1864 the King of\r\nDenmark died, and difficulties at once arose as to the succession to the\r\nDuchies of Schleswig and Holstein, which still belonged to the German\r\nConfederation. Austria and Prussia intervened jointly in the name of the\r\nConfederation, and, as a result, the Duchies were separated from Denmark,\r\nSchleswig being administered by Austria and Holstein by Prussia. The object\r\nof this rather clumsy plan, which originated with Bismarck, was to create\r\ndifficulties which would enable him to pick a quarrel with Austria. In 1866\r\nthis manoeuvre proved successful. Bismarck goaded Austria into war and\r\nsucceeded, after a six weeks' campaign, in expelling her from the German\r\nState system, following this up by rounding off her own dominions with the\r\nannexation of a number of the smaller pro-Austrian States, amongst them the\r\nkingdom of Hanover. His victory also had the effect of completely checking\r\nthe growing agitation for the establishment of responsible government in\r\nPrussia.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On this point see Bismarck's _Recollections_, and the good\r\nshort account in Powicke's _Bismarck_.]\r\n\r\nHaving made Prussia supreme in Germany, Bismarck was now in a position\r\nto solve the problem of German unity. He resolved to employ the same\r\nwell-tried method. In 1870 the somewhat high-handed manner of Napoleon III.\r\nmade it possible for him to bring about a war between the German States\r\nand France, in which Germany, under Prussian leadership, was completely\r\nvictorious. In the flush of their success, after the capture of Paris in\r\nJanuary 1871, the lesser States of Germany agreed to enter into a Federal\r\nUnion under Prussian supremacy and to accept the King of Prussia as its\r\nhead, with the title of Emperor.\r\n\r\nThus, at length, Germany became a National State, with a national\r\nconstitution. The term Empire is misleading, for to English ears it\r\nsuggests the government of dependencies. Germany is not an Empire in that\r\nsense: she is a Federation, like the United States and Switzerland, of\r\nindependent States which have agreed to merge some of their prerogatives,\r\nnotably the conduct of foreign affairs and of defence, in a central\r\nauthority. Since some of these independent States were, and still are,\r\nmonarchies, a higher title had to be provided for the Chief of the\r\nFederation. An ace, as it were, was needed to trump the kings. After much\r\ndeliberation the title Emperor was agreed upon; but it is noteworthy that\r\nthe Kaiser is not \"the Emperor of Germany\": he bears the more non-committal\r\ntitle of \"German Emperor.\"\r\n\r\nThe German Imperial Constitution, devised by Bismarck in 1871, falls far\r\nshort of the Frankfurt experiment of 1848. It does indeed provide for\r\nthe creation of a Reichstag, or Imperial Parliament, elected by all\r\nmale citizens over twenty-five. But the Reichstag can neither initiate\r\nlegislation nor secure the appointment or dismissal of Ministers. In\r\nthe absence of ministerial responsibility to Parliament, which is the\r\nmainspring of our English Constitutional system, the Reichstag might be\r\ndescribed as little more than an advisory body armed with the power of\r\nveto. Like the English Parliament in the days of Charles I.'s ship-money,\r\nthe Reichstag could in the last resort refuse supplies, and so bring the\r\nmachinery of government to a standstill. But this situation has never yet\r\narisen or seemed likely to arise. The Government has ridden the Reichstag\r\nwith a strong hand, turning awkward corners by concessions to the various\r\ngroups in turn, and the Reichstag has responded to this treatment. Bismarck\r\n\"took his majorities where he could get them\"; and Prince Bülow's book\r\ncontains some illuminating pages about the clever methods which that\r\nstatesman adopted to \"manage\" his Parliaments.\r\n\r\nAbove the Reichstag is the Bundesrat or Federal Council, on which all the\r\nFederated States are represented, Prussia having seventeen members as\r\nagainst forty-two from the other States. The Bundesrat sits in secret; its\r\nmembers are selected by the different State Governments and vote according\r\nto instructions received. All Bills originate in the Bundesrat before they\r\nare submitted to the Reichstag, and are re-submitted to the Bundesrat, to\r\nbe passed or vetoed, after alteration in the Reichstag. The twenty-six\r\nmembers of the German Federation represented in the Bundesrat comprise four\r\nkingdoms (Prussia, Bavaria, Würtemberg, and Saxony), a number of Grand\r\nDuchies and smaller ducal States, three Free Cities (Hamburg, Lübeck, and\r\nBremen), and the Imperial Territory of Alsace-Lorraine. All these (except\r\nthe last named) preserve their own local Parliaments and institutions, and\r\nthe second largest, Bavaria, even preserves in peace-time, like the British\r\nself-governing Dominions, her own military organisation and has also her\r\nown postal system. But Prussia in size, influence, and military strength\r\nis by far the most important, and for practical purposes her power\r\npreponderates over that of all the other States combined. The real control\r\nof legislation naturally lies with the State which controls two-fifths\r\nof the votes in the Bundesrat, where legislation is initiated and can\r\nbe vetoed; it is wielded by the Kaiser, as King of Prussia, and by his\r\nImperial Chancellor, President of the Bundesrat and always a Prussian\r\nMinister. The Imperial Chancellor, who is the only Imperial Minister, is\r\nchosen by the Kaiser and is responsible to him alone: he countersigns all\r\nthe Kaiser's orders and edicts, and has the function, it may be added, of\r\nexplaining away his indiscretions.\r\n\r\nIt is inevitable, under these circumstances, that the policy and\r\nlegislation of the central government should largely reflect Prussian views\r\nand ideals. On the other hand, the temper of the rest of Germany must\r\nalways be kept in mind. As Prince Büllow, the late Imperial Chancellor,\r\nsays: \"If the Empire is governed without reference to Prussia, ill-will\r\ntowards the Empire will grow in that country. If Prussia is governed\r\nwithout reference to the Empire, then there is the danger that mistrust and\r\ndislike of the leading State will gain ground in non-Prussian Germany....\r\nThe art of governing in our country will always have to be directed chiefly\r\ntowards maintaining the harmony between Germany and Prussia, in the spirit\r\nas well as in the letter.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Imperial Germany_, pp. 191-192.]\r\n\r\nWhy should the government of Germany be such an \"art\"? And why should there\r\nbe any difficulty in maintaining a harmonious spirit between Prussia and\r\nnon-Prussian Germany? To answer these questions we must widen the scope of\r\nour inquiry. So far we have considered only the growth and development\r\nof the German State. It is now time to turn from the German State to the\r\nGerman people.\r\n\r\n\r\n§2. _The Real Germany_.--The difficulty of establishing German Unity\r\nhas lain in the fact that there have really always been two Germanies,\r\ndifferent in history, in temper, in ideals, and in their stages of\r\ndevelopment in civilisation. There has been Prussia, or North-Eastern\r\nGermany; and there has been the real Germany, the Germany of the South and\r\nWest. It is only since 1870, and especially within the reign of the present\r\nKaiser, that, through education and common experience; the two have become\r\nfused into one; but even now, beneath the uniform surface of German life\r\nand public opinion, there is a great inner distinction.\r\n\r\nLet us take what we have called the real Germany first. This Germany, the\r\nGermany of the Rhine country, of Frankfurt and Heidelberg and Cologne and\r\nNüremberg, is the Germany which so many Englishmen know and admire. This\r\nGermany is an integral part of the civilisation of Western Europe, and is\r\nclosely akin to ourselves. It has grown and developed alongside with France\r\nand the Netherlands and England, sharing in all the great spiritual and\r\nsocial movements of the West. It has passed, with them, through the Middle\r\nAges, the Revival of Learning, the Reformation, and the long struggle\r\nagainst the domination of France. Its famous cities with their Cathedrals\r\nand Town Halls breathe the same proud, free, municipal spirit as those of\r\ntheir great neighbours in the Netherlands, Ghent, Antwerp, Louvain, Bruges,\r\nYpres and the rest. Its scholars and teachers, poets, painters, and\r\nmusicians, from Luther to Goethe, have made their special German\r\ncontribution to the civilised life of the West--a contribution as great and\r\nas unique as that of Renaissance Italy or Elizabethan England. Its people\r\nare very similar in character to their neighbours of kindred stock. As\r\nindustrious as the Dutch, as persevering as the Scotch, as steady and\r\ngood-hearted as the English, good workers, good citizens, devoted in their\r\nfamily relations, they have found it easy to live at peace and on a good\r\nunderstanding with their neighbours, and when they have migrated abroad,\r\nthey have by common confession made the best of settlers, both in the\r\nUnited States and in the British Dominions.\r\n\r\nYet they have developed certain characteristic qualities in their social\r\nand political life, which distinguish them sharply from their western\r\nneighbours. History, which has deprived them, until recently, of a wider\r\ncitizenship, has left them timid, docile, dreamy and unpractical in just\r\nthat sphere of action where Englishmen have learnt for centuries to think\r\nand to act for themselves. Patriotism with Englishmen is an instinct. We\r\ndo not much care to wave flags or make speeches or sing songs about it: we\r\nassume it as the permanent background of our national life and our national\r\nconsciousness. With the Germans this is not so. In Germany, partly owing\r\nto German history, partly owing to the constitution of the German mind,\r\npatriotism is not an instinct but an _idea_. Now ideas do not grow up in\r\nmen's minds by a natural process. They have to be implanted. The Germans\r\nhave needed to be _taught_ to be patriotic. The makers of German patriotism\r\na century ago were teachers and philosophers. They did not simply appeal to\r\ntheir patriotic instincts, as Englishmen would have done: they argued the\r\npoint and _proved_ that Germany was worth fighting for: they founded a\r\nschool of patriotic German philosophy. There are few more curious documents\r\nin history, or more instructive for the light they shed on future\r\nevents, than the famous _Speeches to the German Nation_ addressed to his\r\nfellow-countrymen by the philosopher Fichte in 1808, when his country was\r\nunder the heel of Napoleon. They are not speeches at all, but philosophical\r\nlucubrations, discussing in abstract terms the whole subject of the nature\r\nof patriotism and of Germany's right to exist as a nation. One argument,\r\nfor instance, on which he lays great stress, is that Germany is marked out\r\nto be a great political power because of the peculiar excellence of the\r\nGerman language, which he shows to his satisfaction to be superior to\r\nFrench, Italian, and other Latin languages. Again, he points out that there\r\nis no word in the German language for \"character\" (_Karakter_), a word\r\nborrowed from the Greek; the reason is, he explains, that there is no need\r\nfor one, because to have character and to be German are the same thing--a\r\ncurious foretaste of the German arrogance of to-day. Yet these speeches,\r\nwhich, issued in England at such a crisis, would have found no readers,\r\nreverberated through Germany and helped to create the self-confident spirit\r\nwhich freed her from the invader. Then, as now, under the inspiration of\r\nideas which they had accepted from professors and philosophers, Germans\r\nfought for the German language and for German culture. But whereas in 1814\r\nthey fought to preserve them, in 1914 they are fighting to impose them.\r\n\r\nJust as patriotism in Germany is wholly different from what it is in\r\nEngland, so also is democracy, and all those elements in the national life\r\nwhich feed and sustain it. British democracy does not depend upon our\r\npopular franchise or on any legal rights or enactments. It depends upon the\r\nfree spirit and self-respect of the British people. We have been accustomed\r\nfor centuries to the unrestrained discussion of public affairs; and we\r\ntreat our governors as being in fact, as they are in name, our \"ministers\"\r\nor servants. There is a force called public opinion which, slow though it\r\nmay be to assert itself, British statesmen have been taught by experience\r\nto respect. It is as true of British as it is of American democracy that\r\n\"you can fool half the people all the time; and you can fool all the people\r\nhalf the time; but you cannot fool all the people all the time.\" But the\r\nGerman people, as a people, lacks this irreplaceable heritage of political\r\nself-respect. It has never yet dared to tread the path of democracy without\r\nleading strings. It has not yet learned to think for itself in politics,\r\nor formed the habit of free discussion and practical criticism of public\r\naffairs. This is the vital fact which must be borne in mind in all\r\ncomparisons between German and British democracy. The Germans have a\r\nParliament, elected by Universal Male Suffrage. But this Parliament is\r\npowerless to control policy, because the nation behind it does not give it\r\nsufficient support. It is because of the absence of the driving force of a\r\npublic opinion in Germany that the German people submit complacently to the\r\ninfringements on political liberty which form part of the normal _régime_\r\nof German life--the domineering arrogance of officers and officials,\r\nthe restraints upon the Press and the shameless manufacture of news\r\nand inspiration of opinion from official sources, the control of the\r\nUniversities, the schools, and the public services by the State in the\r\ninterest of \"orthodox\" political opinions, and the ridiculous laws which\r\nhave sent editors and cartoonists to prison in scores for criticising the\r\nbehaviour and utterances of the Emperor or the Crown Prince. In England and\r\nin America underground attempts are sometimes made to injure the careers of\r\nmen whose opinions are considered \"dangerous\" by those who employ them.\r\nIn Germany such interference with freedom of political thought is not the\r\nexception: it has become the rule. No man can make a successful career\r\nin the public service (and education is a public service) unless he is\r\nconsidered politically \"orthodox\" (_gesinnungstüchtig_); and orthodoxy does\r\nnot simply mean abstention from damaging criticism or dangerous opinions:\r\nit means, in practice, deference to the opinions of those who \"know\r\nbetter,\" that is, to the clique of Prussian generals and bureaucrats who,\r\ntogether with the Kaiser, control the policy of the country.\r\n\r\nBritish readers who do not know Germany may think the foregoing indictment\r\nof German political incapacity severe. It is not so severe as Prince\r\nBüllow's. The portion of the late Imperial Chancellor's book which deals\r\nwith domestic policy opens with these crushing sentences: \"The history of\r\nour home policy, with the exception of a few bright spots, is a history of\r\npolitical mistakes. Despite the abundance of merits and great qualities\r\nwith which the German nation is endowed, political talent has been denied\r\nit.... We are not a political people.\" A page or two later he goes even\r\nfurther and quotes with approval a dictum that the Germans are\r\n\"political donkeys.\" That a modern statesman should think this of his\r\nfellow-countrymen is remarkable enough; that he should say it outright is\r\na still more remarkable proof of his unshakeable belief in their\r\nsubmissiveness. Therein lies the whole tragedy of the present situation.\r\nThe German people, so kindly and, alas! so docile, is suffering, not for\r\nits sins, but for its deficiencies; not for its own characteristic acts or\r\nnatural ambitions, but for what it has too tamely allowed others, Prussian\r\nstatesmen and soldiers, with alien ideals and an alien temper, to foist\r\nupon it, until it has become an integral part of its natural life and\r\nconsciousness. Germany has been indoctrinated and Prussianised not only\r\ninto acquiescence, but into sympathy with the policy of its rulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n§3. _Prussia_.--This brings us to the consideration of the second and more\r\npowerful of the two Germanies--namely, Prussia. In order to understand\r\nPrussia and the Prussian spirit we must plunge ourselves into an atmosphere\r\nwholly different from that of the Germany that has just been described. The\r\nvery names of the two countries mark the measure of the difference. Germany\r\nmeans the country of the Germans, as England means the country of the\r\nEnglish. But the name Prussia commemorates the subjugation and extinction\r\nby German conquerors and crusaders from the west of the Prussians or\r\nBo-Russians, a tribe akin to the Letts and Lithuanians. The old Duchy of\r\nPrussia, which now forms the provinces of East and West Prussia at the\r\nextreme North-East of the present German Empire, consisted of heathen lands\r\ncolonised or conquered, between the thirteenth and sixteenth centuries, by\r\na great religious and military organisation known as the \"Knights of the\r\nTeutonic Order.\" While Southern and Western Germany was passing, with the\r\nrest of Western Europe, through the transition between mediaeval and modern\r\nEurope, what is now North-Eastern Germany was still in a wholly primitive\r\nstage of development, and the Knights of the Teutonic Order, with crusading\r\nfervour, were spreading Christianity and German \"culture\" by force of\r\narms, converting or repelling the Slavonic population and settling German\r\ncolonists in the territory thus reclaimed for civilisation. The great\r\nBritish admirer of Prussia, Thomas Carlyle, in the first volume of his\r\n_Frederick the Great_, gives a vivid account of their activities in their\r\nforts or \"burgs\" of wood and stone, and helps us to realise what memories\r\nlie behind the struggle between German and Slav to-day, and why the word\r\n\"Petersburg\" has become so odious to the Russians as the name of their\r\ncapital. \"The Teutsch Ritters build a Burg for headquarters, spread\r\nthemselves this way and that, and begin their great task. The Prussians\r\nwere a fierce fighting people, fanatically anti-Christian: the Teutsch\r\nRitters had a perilous never-resting time of it.... They built and burnt\r\ninnumerable stockades for and against: built wooden Forts which are now\r\nstone Towns. They fought much and prevalently, galloped desperately to and\r\nfro, ever on the alert. How many Burgs of wood and stone they built in\r\ndifferent parts, what revolts, surprisals, furious fights in woody, boggy\r\nplaces they had, no man counted; their life, read in Dryasdust's newest\r\nchaotic Books (which are of endless length, among other ill qualities) is\r\nlike a dim nightmare of unintelligible marching and fighting: one feels\r\nas if the mere amount of galloping they had would have carried the Order\r\nseveral times round the Globe.... But always some preaching, by zealous\r\nmonks, accompanies the chivalrous fighting. And colonists come in from\r\nGermany; trickling in, or at times streaming. Victorious Ritterdom offers\r\nterms to the beaten Heathen; terms not of tolerant nature, but which will\r\nbe punctually kept by Ritterdom.\" Here we see the strange stern, medieval,\r\ncrusading atmosphere which lies behind the unpleasant combinations, so\r\nfamiliar to us to-day in France and Belgium, of Uhlans and religion, of\r\nculture and violence, of \"Germanisation\" and devastation. When we hear the\r\nGerman professors of to-day preaching of the spread of German culture by\r\nthe German arms, and when we feel disgust at the exaggerated religious\r\nphraseology which pervades the Kaiser's oratory and seems to accord so ill\r\nwith his policy and ambitions, we must remember the peculiar origins of the\r\nPrussian State and how comparatively recent those origins are. \"I have once\r\nbefore had occasion,\" said the Kaiser at Marienburg in East Prussia on June\r\n5, 1902, \"to say in this place how Marienburg, this unique Eastern bulwark,\r\nthe point of departure for the culture of the lands east of the Vistula,\r\nwill always be a symbol for our German mission. There is work for us\r\nagain to-day. Polish arrogance wishes to lay hands on Germanism, and I am\r\nconstrained to call my people to the defence of its national possessions.\r\nHere in Marienburg I proclaim that I expect all the brothers of the Order\r\nof St. John to be at my service when I call upon them to protect German\r\nways and German customs.\" The Kaiser's crusading appeals are not\r\nhypocritical or consciously insincere: they are simply many centuries out\r\nof date--a grotesque medley of medieval romanticism and royal megalomania.\r\nWhat was possible for the warrior knights in North-East Germany five or six\r\ncenturies ago is a tragic absurdity and an outrageous crime to-day among\r\na spirited and sensitive people like the Poles--still more so in a highly\r\ncivilised national State such as Belgium or France. It is an absurdity that\r\nonly a theatrical monarch could conceive and a crime that only a military\r\nautocracy could attempt to enforce.\r\n\r\nIn the sixteenth century the Reformation, spreading throughout the North of\r\nEurope, undermined the basis of the Teutonic Order. The Grand Master of\r\nthe time transformed himself into a Lutheran Prince holding the hereditary\r\nDuchy of Prussia as a vassal of the King of the neighbouring Slavonic\r\nState of Poland. In 1611 the Duchy was amalgamated with the territory of\r\nBrandenburg farther west, and in 1647 the enlarged Prussian territories\r\nwon their emancipation from Poland. Prussia now became a distinct State,\r\nessentially German in character (as opposed to the Poles and Lithuanians on\r\nits Eastern border), but still remaining for a time outside the community\r\nof the other German States.\r\n\r\nThe union between Prussia and Brandenburg had brought Prussia under the\r\nrule of the House of Hohenzollern, which, although originally a South\r\nGerman family, had borne rule in Brandenburg since 1415. Under the\r\nHohenzollerns Prussia rapidly increased in territory and influence until in\r\n1701 the ruler of the day, the grandfather of Frederick the Great, took on\r\nhimself the title of King. Under Frederick the Great, Prussia's career of\r\nconquest and aggrandisement continued. Seizing a convenient opportunity, he\r\ninvaded and annexed the Austrian province of Silesia, and later joined with\r\nAustria and Russia in promoting the shameful Partition of Poland. The old\r\nconquering and \"civilising\" policy of the Teutonic Knights was continued,\r\nbut under new conditions and in a brutal and cynical spirit which rendered\r\nit impossible of success. \"The surest means of giving this oppressed nation\r\nbetter ideas and morals,\" wrote Frederick the Great, in words quoted\r\nwith approval by Prince Bülow, \"will always be gradually to get them to\r\nintermarry with Germans, even if at first it is only two or three of them\r\nin every village.\" This spirit in Prussian policy may have extinguished the\r\nancient Prussians, but it has not yet begun to Germanise the Poles, and has\r\ngone far to de-Germanise the Alsatians. But it explains the utterances and\r\njustifies the sincerity of those who believe that to-day, as in the early\r\ndays of her history, Prussia is fighting on behalf of \"culture.\"\r\n\r\nPrussia remains to-day, what she has been for the last two centuries, an\r\naggressive military monarchy. \"Prussia attained her greatness,\" says Prince\r\nBülow, \"as a country of soldiers and officials, and as such she was able\r\nto accomplish the work of German union; to this day she is still, in all\r\nessentials, a State of soldiers and officials.\" Power rests in the hands\r\nof the monarch and of a bureaucracy of military and civil officials,\r\nresponsible to him alone, and traditionally and fanatically loyal to the\r\nmonarch who is, before all things, their War Lord.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian outlook is so foreign to Western habits of thought that it is\r\nwell that we should try to understand it at its best. Prussia proper has\r\nnot been rich, like the rest of Germany, in poets and imaginative writers;\r\nbut she is fortunate to-day in possessing in the greatest living Greek\r\nscholar, Professor von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, a man who by birth and\r\nbreeding is able to put the highest interpretation upon the aims and spirit\r\nof the Prussian State. To Wilamowitz Prussia is not only nearer and dearer\r\nthan Athens. She is better, and more advanced. At the close of a wonderful\r\naddress on \"the glory of the Athenian Empire,\" in which he has employed all\r\nthe resources of his wide learning to paint a picture of Ancient Greece\r\nat her best, Wilamowitz breaks into this impassioned peroration: \"But one\r\nelement in life, the best of all, ye lacked, noble burghers of Athens.\r\nYour sages tell us of that highest love which, freed from all bodily\r\nentanglements, spends itself on institutions, on laws, on ideas. We\r\nPrussians, a rough, much-enduring tribe of Northerners, may be compacted\r\nof harder stuff; but we believe that love is on a higher level when the\r\nfullest devotion to an institution and an idea is inseparably linked with\r\nan entirely personal devotion to a human being; and at least we know how\r\nwarm such a love can make a loyal heart. When our children have scarce\r\nlearned to fold their hands before God, we set a picture before them, we\r\nteach them to recognise the noble features; we tell them, 'This is our good\r\nKing.' Our young men, when they are of age to bear arms, look with joy and\r\npride on the trim garb of war, and say, 'I go in the King's coat.' And when\r\nthe nation assembles to a common political celebration, the occasion is no\r\nFeast of the Constitution, no Day of the Bastille, no Panathenaic Festival.\r\nIt is then that we bow in reverence and loyalty before him who has allowed\r\nus to see with our own eyes that for which our Fathers dreamed and\r\nyearned, before him who ever extends the bounds of the Kingdom in Freedom,\r\nProsperity, and Righteousness, before his Majesty the Emperor and King.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Speeches and Lectures_, 3rd edition, Berlin, 1913, p. 65. The\r\n\"good King\" referred to is the old Emperor William, as the address dates\r\nfrom 1877.]\r\n\r\nHere, far better expressed than in the Kaiser's speeches, we see the spirit\r\nof the Prussian Junker at its best. It is narrow, old-fashioned, and, to\r\ndemocratic ears, almost grotesque. Yet, if it survives uncorrupted by the\r\ndangers to which progress always exposes a military caste, it will not be\r\neasy either to crush by defeat or to transform by humiliation.\r\n\r\nIt is among the old Prussian nobility and the large landed proprietors\r\nin the original Prussian provinces, who have come to be known as the\r\n\"Junkers,\" that this spirit prevails. They stand for the old stern\r\nrepressive military discipline and unchanging Conservatism in its extremest\r\nform, regarding with well-founded suspicion and misgiving symptoms of\r\ndevelopment in any direction whatsoever. No party in Germany acquiesced\r\nmore unwillingly in the changes necessitated by her commercial and\r\nindustrial development. Even their militarism stopped short at the\r\nArmy, and it required a substantial increase in the protective tariff\r\nsafeguarding their agricultural interests to purchase their reluctant\r\nadhesion to the Kaiser's policy of naval expansion. Even now the German\r\nNavy, the pride of the commercial and industrial classes throughout the\r\nGerman Empire, is regarded by them with uneasy suspicion as a parvenu\r\nservice, in which the old Prussian influences count for less in promotion\r\nthan technical skill and practical efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe institutions of the Prussian State represent the spirit of its ruling\r\ncaste. If the German Empire is not democratic, Prussia lags far behind it.\r\nThe electoral system in use for the Prussian Lower House is too complicated\r\nto explain here. Its injustice may be gauged from the fact that in 1900\r\nthe Social Democrats, who actually polled a majority of the votes, secured\r\nseven seats out of nearly 400. The whole spirit and practice of the\r\nGovernment is inimical to inborn British conceptions of civil liberty and\r\npersonal rights. There is one law and code of conduct for officers and\r\nanother for civilians, and woe betide the civilian who resists the military\r\npretensions. The incidents at Zabern in Alsace in 1913 are still fresh\r\nin public memory, reinforced by evidence of a similar spirit in German\r\nmilitary proclamations in France and Belgium. But it is important to\r\nrealise that these incidents are not exceptional outbursts but common\r\nPrussian practice, upheld, as the sequel to the Zabern events proved, by\r\nthe highest authority.\r\n\r\nPrussia, and through Prussia Germany, is in effect ruled in accordance with\r\nthe wishes of the official caste: and short of a popular rising nothing but\r\ndefeat can dethrone it. \"Any one who has any familiarity at all with our\r\nofficers and generals,\" says an authoritative German writer, in words that\r\nwe may hope will be prophetic, \"knows that it would take another Sedan,\r\ninflicted on us instead of by us, before they would acquiesce in the\r\ncontrol of the Army by the German Parliament.\"[1] No clearer statement\r\ncould be given as to where the real power lies in Germany, and how stern\r\nwill be the task of displacing it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Professor Delbrück (who succeeded to the chair of history\r\nin Berlin held so long by Treitschke), in a book published early in 1914\r\n(_Government and the Popular Will_, p. 136).]\r\n\r\nThe foreign policy of Prussia has reflected the same domineering spirit.\r\nIts object has been the increase of its power and territory by conquest or\r\ncunning: and by the successful prosecution of this policy it has extended\r\nPrussian authority and Prussian influence over a large part of Western\r\nGermany. The best way of illustrating this will be to quote a passage from\r\nthe _Recollections of Prince Bismarck,_ who directed Prussian policy from\r\n1862 to 1890. In 1864 trouble arose as to the succession to the Duchies of\r\nSchleswig and Holstein on the Danish border. Prussia had no claim whatever\r\nto the Duchies; but she coveted Holstein because it would give her a\r\nWestern sea-board, with the results that we all know. Bismarck describes\r\nthe arguments which he used to persuade his Royal Master to assert\r\nhis claim. \"I reminded him,\" he writes, \"that each of his immediate\r\npredecessors had won an addition to the Monarchy\": he then went through the\r\nhistory of the six previous reigns, and ended by encouraging King\r\nWilliam to be worthy of his ancestors. His advice, as we have seen, was\r\nsuccessfully adopted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PRUSSIA SINCE THE ACCESSION OF FREDERICK THE GREAT]\r\n\r\nThe conquest of France in 1870, by means of the military power of Germany\r\nunder Prussian leadership, made Prussia supreme in Germany, and the German\r\narmy supreme in Central Europe. The Treaty of Frankfurt in May 1871, by\r\nwhich the new French Republic ceded to the German Empire the two French\r\nprovinces of Alsace and Lorraine, marked the opening of a new epoch in\r\nEuropean history, the period of the Armed Peace, which ended in 1914. It\r\nmarked also the opening of a new epoch in Germany, some features of which\r\nwe must now examine.\r\n\r\n\r\n§4. _Germany since 1870_.--German history from 1871 to 1914 falls into two\r\nwell-defined periods. During the first period, from 1871 to 1888, Germany\r\nwas ruled by her Imperial Chancellor, Prince Bismarck. But the accession of\r\nthe present Kaiser led to a change, not in the letter, but in the spirit of\r\nthe new constitution, and since 1890, when William II. \"dropped the pilot\"\r\nand selected a more amenable successor, the real control of policy has lain\r\nwith the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe relations between Prince Bismarck and the old Emperor, who was over\r\nninety when he died in 1888, form a touching passage in modern history.\r\nAlthough his grandson has publicly claimed for him a peculiar measure of\r\ndivine inspiration, his strength lay in his implicit confidence in his\r\ngreat minister. Bismarck's attitude to him, as described in his _Memoirs_,\r\nis rather like that of an old family retainer who has earned by long and\r\nfaithful service the right to assert his views and to pit his judgment\r\nagainst his master's. His one formidable antagonist was the Empress; and\r\nlong experience, he tells us, enabled him to judge whether difficulties in\r\npersuading the old Kaiser to adopt a given line of policy were due to\r\nhis own judgment or conceived \"in the interests of domestic peace.\" The\r\nfaithful servant had his own appropriate methods of winning his way in\r\neither case.\r\n\r\nBut with the new Kaiser the old minister's astuteness availed nothing,\r\nand the story of Bismarck's curt dismissal, after thirty-eight years\r\nof continuous service, from the post which he had created for himself,\r\nillustrates the danger of framing a constitution to meet a particular\r\ntemporary situation. Bismarck, put out of action by his own machinery,\r\nretired growling to his country seat, and lived to see the reversal of his\r\nforeign policy and the exposure of Germany, through the Franco-Russian\r\nAlliance, to the one danger he always dreaded, an attack on both flanks.\r\n\r\nLike Germany's present rulers, Bismarck was not a scrupulous man; but\r\nunlike them he was shrewd and far-sighted, and understood the statesmen and\r\nthe peoples with whom he had to deal. The main object of his foreign policy\r\nwas to preserve the prestige of the German army as the chief instrument of\r\npower in Central Europe, and to allow the new Germany, after three wars in\r\nseven years, time to develop in peace and to consolidate her position as\r\none of the Great Powers.\r\n\r\nThe situation was not an easy one; for Germany's rapid rise to power,\r\nand the methods by which she had acquired it, had not made her popular.\r\nBismarck's foreign policy was defensive throughout, and he pursued it along\r\ntwo lines. He sought to strengthen Germany by alliances, and to weaken her\r\nrivals by embroiling them with one another. The great fruit of his policy\r\nwas the formation, completed in 1882, of the Triple Alliance between\r\nGermany, Austria-Hungary and Italy.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing sentimental about the Triple Alliance. The Italians hate\r\nthe Austrians, whom they drove out of Venice as recently as 1866, while\r\nneither the German Austrians nor the other races in the Dual Monarchy have\r\nany love lost for the Prussians. But Bismarck decided that this combination\r\nwas the safest in Germany's interest: so he set to work to play upon\r\nAustria's fear of Russia, and to embroil Italy with France in North Africa;\r\nand his manoeuvres were duly rewarded.\r\n\r\nBut this was not sufficient. Faced with the implacable hostility of France,\r\non account of the lost provinces, Bismarck saw danger of trouble from a\r\nFrench Coalition with the two remaining Great Powers, Britain and Russia.\r\nBismarck never liked England; but he never made his successors' mistake of\r\ndespising her. He cultivated good relations, but he rejected the idea of an\r\nalliance, because, as he said, \"the English constitution is not compatible\r\nwith treaties of assured continuity.\" In other words, he fought shy of\r\nBritish democracy, which he felt to be an incalculable factor. This threw\r\nhim back upon Russia.\r\n\r\nThe relations between the German and the Russian peoples have never been\r\ncordial. But between the reactionary bureaucracies of the Prussian and\r\nRussian governments there was a strong bond of mutual interest, which\r\nBismarck exploited to the full. Both had popular movements to hold in\r\ncheck, both had stolen goods to guard in the shape of their Polish\r\npossessions, and both had an interest in the preservation of reactionary\r\ninstitutions. The influence of Prussia upon Russia, and of the efficient,\r\nhighly-organised, relentless Prussian machine upon the arbitrary,\r\ntyrannical, but far less efficient and inhuman bureaucracy of Russia, has\r\nbeen wholly sinister[1], both for Russia and for Europe. Bismarck's object,\r\nof course, was not so much to keep down the Russian revolutionaries as to\r\ncheck the aspirations of the Panslavists, whose designs for the liberation\r\nof the Slav nationalities, as we now see them unfolding, threaten the\r\nstability both of Prussia and of Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The same remark applies to the influence of Germany on\r\nTurkey.]\r\n\r\nThroughout the 'eighties Bismarck succeeded in keeping on foot a secret\r\nunderstanding with Russia. How deeply he had implanted the necessity of\r\nthis policy in the mind of William I. is brought home by the fact that it\r\nwas the thought uppermost in the old man's mind as he lay on his deathbed.\r\n\"Never lose touch with the Tsar,\" whispered the old man to his grandson,\r\nwhen he was almost too weak to speak. \"There is no cause for quarrel.\"\r\n\r\nThe old Emperor died in 1888. In 1890 the young Emperor \"dropped the\r\npilot.\" In the same year Russia refused to renew her secret treaty. In 1891\r\nthe first Franco-Russian Treaty was signed, and the diplomatic supremacy\r\nof Europe passed from the Triple Alliance to be shared between the two\r\nopposing groups with which we have been familiar in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of Prince Bismarck marked the beginning of a new phase in\r\nGerman policy and in German life. The younger generation, which had come\r\nto maturity, like the Kaiser, since 1870, had never known the old divided\r\nGermany, or realised the difficulties of her statesmen. Every one wondered\r\nwhat use the young Kaiser would make of the great Army bequeathed to him.\r\nHe was believed to be a firebrand. Few believed that, imbued with Prussian\r\ntraditions, he would keep the peace for twenty-five years; fewer still\r\nthat, when he broke it, Germany would have the second Navy in the world.\r\n\r\nBut we are not now concerned with the baffling personality of the Kaiser\r\nhimself. What is important for us here is the general attitude of mind\r\namong the German public of the Kaiser's generation, which has rendered\r\npossible the prosecution of the cherished ideas of their ruler.\r\n\r\nThe school of thought which has been steadily gaining force, under official\r\nencouragement, during the last twenty-five years is best summed up in\r\nthe popular watchwords, \"Germany's place in the sun\" and \"World-Policy\"\r\n(_Weltpolitik_). These phrases embody, for Germans, who always tend to be\r\nabstract in their thinking, not only a practical policy, but a philosophy\r\nof human society and government.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place in which to analyse in detail the outlook upon life\r\n(_Weltanschauung_) of the man in the street in modern Germany. It is a\r\nconfused and patchwork philosophy, drawn, consciously or unconsciously,\r\nfrom many quarters--from the old cosmopolitan tradition of German culture,\r\ndating from Goethe and Leasing; from the brave and arrogant claims\r\nof Fichte and the prophets and poets of the Napoleonic era; from the\r\nfar-reaching influence of Hegel and his idealisation of the Prussian State;\r\nfrom the reaction to \"realism\" in politics after 1848; from the prestige\r\nof Bismarck and the deep impression made by the apparent success of his\r\nmethods and principles; from the gifted Prussian historians, Treitschke and\r\nSybel, who set their own interpretation upon Bismarck's work and imprinted\r\nit, by speech and pen, upon the mind of the German nation; and from a\r\nhasty interpretation of the theories of writers like Nietzsche and\r\nThomas Carlyle, with their exaltation of \"heroes\" and \"supermen,\" their\r\nencouragements to \"live dangerously,\" their admiration for will-power\r\nas against reason and feeling, and their tirades against legal shams,\r\n\"ballot-box democracy,\" and flabby humanitarianism.\r\n\r\nThe practical object of the policy of _Weltpolitik_ can be simply stated.\r\nIt is to extend to the other continents, and to the world as a whole,\r\nthe power and the prestige secured for Germany in Europe by the work of\r\nBismarck. \"When Germany had won a mighty position on a level with the older\r\nGreat Powers,\" says Prince Bülow, \"the path of international politics\r\nlay open to her ... In the Emperor William II. the nation found a\r\nclear-sighted, strong-willed guide who led them along the new road.\"\r\n\r\nSome such expansion of German influence was inevitable from the facts of\r\nher economic development since 1871. The population of the Empire, which\r\nin 1871 was 41,000,000, has now risen to 65,000,000. The resources of the\r\ncountry, the neglect of which during the days of disunion had forced\r\nso many Germans to emigrate for a livelihood, have been rapidly and\r\nscientifically developed. Already in the 'eighties \"Made in Germany\" had\r\nbecome a familiar talisman, and, before the outbreak of the present war,\r\nGermany ranked with the United States as the second greatest commercial\r\npower in the world.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, of course, there has been a great change in the\r\ndistribution of the population. In the year 1850 65 per cent, and in 1870\r\n47 per cent of the working population were engaged in agriculture. By 1912\r\nthe proportion had sunk to 28.6 per cent.\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable also that Germany should share with the other Great\r\nPowers in the work of colonial government. The adjustment of the relations\r\nbetween the advanced and backward races of mankind is the greatest\r\npolitical task of our age; it is a responsibility shared jointly between\r\nall the civilised States, and when in the 'eighties and 'nineties the vast\r\nregions of Africa were partitioned amongst them, Germany, late in the\r\nfield, asserted her claims and received her share in the responsibility.\r\n\r\nRapid economic development and a colonial empire--what was there in these\r\nto cause hostility between Germany and Great Britain? The United States\r\nhave passed through a similar development and have accepted a similar\r\nextension of responsibility far outside their own continent. America is a\r\ngreat, a growing, and a self-respecting Power; yet Americans see no ground\r\nfor that inevitable conflict of interests between their country and Great\r\nBritain which forms the theme of so many German books, from Prince Bülow's\r\ncandid self-revelations down to less responsible writers like Bernhardi.\r\n\r\nThe explanation lies in the nature of German thought and ambitions. When\r\nGermans speak of \"a place in the sun,\" they are not thinking of the spread\r\nof German trade, the success of German adventure or enterprise, or of\r\nthe achievements of Germans in distant lands. They are thinking of the\r\nextension of the German State. British influence beyond the seas has been\r\nbuilt up during the last four centuries by the character and achievements\r\nof British pioneers. Downing Street has seldom helped, often hindered, and\r\ngenerally only ratified the accomplished facts of British settlement and\r\ninfluence. That is not the Prussian theory or the Prussian method. It is\r\nfor the State to win the territory, and then to set the people to work\r\nthere, on lines laid down from above. The individual Englishman, when\r\nhe goes out to colonise, carries England with him, as a part of his\r\npersonality. Not so the German, at least on the Prussian theory. \"The _rare\r\ncase_ supervened,\" says Prince Bülow,[1] of an instance typical of the\r\nbuilding up of the British Empire, \"that the establishment of State rule\r\n_followed and did not precede_ the tasks of colonising and civilisation.\"\r\nThe State itself, on this theory, has a civilising mission of expansion\r\ntowards which it directs the activities of its citizens.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Imperial Germany_, 1st ed., p. 249.]\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of ideas such as these, Germany, since the accession of\r\nWilliam II., has built a Navy second to that of Great Britain alone.\r\n\r\nWhat was the purpose of the building of the German Navy? The German\r\nofficial answer is that its purpose was the protection of German trade. \"We\r\nare now vulnerable at sea,\" says Prince Bülow. \"We have entrusted millions\r\nto the ocean, and with these millions, the weal and woe of many of our\r\ncountrymen. If we had not in good time provided protection for them ...\r\nwe should have been exposed to the danger of having one day to look on\r\ndefencelessly while we were deprived of them. We should have been placed in\r\nthe position of being unable to employ and support a considerable number of\r\nour millions of inhabitants at home. The result would have been an\r\neconomic crisis which might easily attain the proportions of a national\r\ncatastrophe.\"\r\n\r\nThese words may yet prove prophetic. But the catastrophe will not be the\r\nresult of Germany's lack of a Navy; it will be the result of challenging\r\nthe naval supremacy of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nPrince Bülow's argument assumes, as a basis, the hostility of Great\r\nBritain. This assumption, as we know, was unjustified; and its persistence\r\nin the German mind can only be set down to an uneasy conscience. The hard\r\nfact of the matter is that it is impossible for Germany or for any other\r\nPower successfully to defend her foreign trade in case of war with Great\r\nBritain. No other Power thinks it necessary to attempt to do so, for no\r\nother Power has reason to desire or to foresee a naval conflict with Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\nEver since 1493, when the Pope divided the monopoly of traffic on the ocean\r\nbetween Spain and Portugal, and English mariners flouted his edict,\r\nGreat Britain has stood for the policy of the Open Sea, and there is no\r\nlikelihood of our abandoning it. The German official theory of the purpose\r\nof their Navy, with its suspicious attitude towards British sea-power, was,\r\nin effect, a bid for supremacy, inspired by the same ideas which made\r\nthe German army, under Bismarck, supreme in Central Europe. The Kaiser's\r\nspeeches on naval matters, notably his famous declaration that \"our future\r\nis on the water,\" provide an official confirmation, if one were needed, of\r\nthe real nature of Germany's naval ambitions.\r\n\r\nBut what right, it may be asked, has Great Britain to this naval supremacy?\r\nWhy should we, more than any other Power, claim one of the elements for our\r\nown? Has not Germany some reason to be jealous? Why should we not allow\r\nher, together with ourselves, \"a place on the Ocean\"?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this lies in the character of the British Empire. One quarter\r\nof the human race live under the Union Jack, scattered throughout the\r\noceans and controlled from a small island in the Western seas. For Great\r\nBritain, alone among the States of the world, naval supremacy, and nothing\r\nless, is a daily and hourly necessity. India realised this truth recently\r\nin a flash when, after generations of silent protection by British\r\nsea-power, German shells fell one night at Madras. Any Power that\r\nchallenges the naval supremacy of Great Britain is quarrelling, not with\r\nthe British Government or the British people, but with the facts of\r\nhistory, of geography, and of the political evolution of the world. The\r\nBritish Empire has not been built up, like the German, by the work of\r\nstatesmen and thinkers; it is not the result, as Germans think, of\r\nfar-seeing national policy or persistent ambition and \"greed.\" It has\r\nslowly taken shape, during the last four centuries, since intercourse was\r\nopened up by sea between the different races of mankind, in accordance with\r\nthe needs of the world as a whole. Its collapse, at the hands of Germany or\r\nany other Power, would not mean the substitution of a non-British Empire\r\nfor a British. It would inaugurate a period of chaos in all five continents\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nThe rulers and people of Germany, who counted on the \"decadence\" of Great\r\nBritain and the disintegration of her unorganised Empire, did not realise\r\nthese simple facts. Their lack of perception was due partly to their\r\npolitical inexperience; but a deeper reason for it lies in their wholly\r\nfalse estimate as to what \"world-policy\" and \"world-empire\" mean. Trained\r\nin the Prussian school, they thought of them, like soldiers, in terms of\r\nconquest, glory, and prestige. That way lies Napoleonism. None of the great\r\nPowers is wholly free from blame on this score. But until Germans realise,\r\nas the other Powers are slowly realising, that the true basis of Empire is\r\nnot a love of glory but a sense of responsibility towards backward peoples,\r\nit will be hard to readmit them into the comity of the Great Powers. Only\r\na sense of common purposes and ideals, and of joint responsibility for\r\nworld-problems, can make the Concert of Europe a reality.\r\n\r\nSuch is the general attitude of mind among the German public of the younger\r\ngeneration. Let us now turn to the effect of this new outlook upon the\r\npolitical parties and groupings.\r\n\r\nThe chief result has been the extinction in Germany, as a political force,\r\nof the great liberal movement of the mid-nineteenth century which in\r\nEngland, France, and other Western countries has grown and developed during\r\nthe last generation along lines corresponding to the needs of the new\r\ncentury. The younger generation of middle-class Germans, indoctrinated\r\nwith \"orthodox\" and \"national\" opinions at school and on military service,\r\neschew the ideals which attracted their fathers and grandfathers in 1848;\r\nand, although so-called \"liberal,\" \"free-thinking,\" and Radical parties\r\nstill exist, they have steadily been growing more militarist. Militarism in\r\nits new guise, bound up with ideas of industrial and commercial expansion,\r\nis far more attractive to them than in the form of the Prussian Army. The\r\nEmperor's Navy Bills were from the first more popular in commercial and\r\nindustrial circles than with the old Prussian Conservatives. But as the\r\nyears went on the Kaiser succeeded in converting both the Junkers to his\r\nNavy Bills and the middle classes to his Army Bills, so that by 1913, when\r\nhe demanded the \"great national sacrifice\" of a levy of 50 million pounds\r\nby a tax, not on income, but on property, there was no difficulty whatever\r\nabout \"managing\" the Reichstag. \"The Army Bill of 1913,\" says Prince Bülow,\r\n\"met with such a willing reception from all parties as had never been\r\naccorded to any requisition for armaments on land and sea.... So far as man\r\ncan tell, every necessary and justifiable Army and Navy Bill will always be\r\nable to count on a safe Parliamentary majority.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Imperial Germany_, p. 169.]\r\n\r\nPrince Bülow's \"safe Parliamentary majority\" means, of course, a majority\r\nsufficient to outvote the Social Democrats, with whom every German\r\nGovernment has to reckon as a permanent opposition.\r\n\r\nSo far we have left the Social Democrats out of the picture. It was\r\nnecessary to do this, in discussing German policy and the relation between\r\nthe German Government and Reichstag opinion; for the German Government\r\nitself habitually leaves them out of the picture. Hitherto in Germany, so\r\nfar as opinion on political questions has mattered at all, it is upper-and\r\nmiddle-class opinion that has counted, as it counted in England up to fifty\r\nyears ago. To the German Government and to the ordinary educated German\r\nthe Social Democratic party, though it numbers in its voting ranks over 4\r\nmillion German workmen and others, does not represent German opinion at\r\nall: it represents something un-German and anti-German--a public enemy.\r\nBetween the Social Democrats and the rest of society a great gulf is fixed,\r\nacross which no intercourse is possible: as the pioneers who attempted to\r\nintroduce the Workers' Educational Association into Germany found, such\r\nintercourse is forbidden from either direction. The Social Democrats are\r\nthe \"Red Danger,\" \"men who,\" in the Kaiser's words, are \"the enemies of\r\nEmpire and Fatherland,\" and \"unworthy\" (except, of course, in war-time)\r\n\"to bear the name of Germans.\" We must go back a hundred years in English\r\nhistory to realise the depth of the animosity between the Social Democratic\r\nparty and the rest of German society. \"The word Radical,\" says an English\r\nhistorian, \"conveyed a very different meaning in 1816 to what it does\r\nnow.... The hands of the Radicals were supposed to be against every man,\r\nand every man's hand was against them. Scott, when he talks of rebels in\r\narms, always styles them Radicals. 'Radicalism is a spirit,' wrote the\r\nVicar of Harrow in 1820, 'of which the first elements are a rejection of\r\nScripture, and a contempt of all the institutions of your country, and\r\nof which the results, unless averted by a merciful Providence, must be\r\nanarchy, atheism, and universal ruin.'\"[1] The Vicar of Harrow in 1820 very\r\nfairly sums up the substance of innumerable German speeches, pamphlets, and\r\nelection addresses in 1912 on the subject of the Social Democrats.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Spencer Walpole, _History of England_, vol. i. p. 348.]\r\n\r\nHow is this extraordinary position maintained? How is it possible that in a\r\nmodern, largely industrial community, the representatives of working-class\r\nopinion should be regarded as public enemies?\r\n\r\nThe chief reason lies, of course, in the fact that the German Empire is not\r\na democracy and is not governed by ministers responsible to Parliament. The\r\nimmense numbers and rapid growth of the Social Democrats have therefore not\r\nreally been a menace to the Government. In fact, it has even been held in\r\nsome quarters that it has been to the interest of the German Government,\r\nwhich is based on the Prussian military caste, to manoeuvre the Social\r\nDemocrats into an extreme position and then to hold them up as a terrible\r\nexample of what democracy means. \"This,\" they can tell the German people,\r\n\"is the alternative to Prussian rule.\" A dangerous policy, it may be\r\nargued, for the Social Democrats may some day secure a majority in the\r\nReichstag. The Prussian answer to this is that, without a redistribution\r\nof seats, this is barely conceivable; and that, were it to take place,\r\nthe Reichstag would promptly be dissolved for new elections on a narrower\r\nfranchise. Bismarck himself contemplated this course, and his successors\r\nwould not shrink from it.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why it has been possible for the Government to ignore the\r\nSocial Democrats has been the absence of a practical alternative programme\r\non the part of the Social Democrats themselves. \"If I had to make out a\r\nschool report for the Social Democratic Movement,\" said Prince Bülow in\r\nthe Reichstag on one occasion, \"I should say, 'Criticism, agitation,\r\ndiscipline, and self-sacrifice, I. _a_; positive achievements, lucidity of\r\nprogramme, V. _b._'\" The taunt is not undeserved. The Socialist Movement\r\nin Germany has suffered, like so many German movements, through a rigid\r\nadherence to logical theories. Under the leadership of old revolutionary\r\nthinkers like Bebel it has failed to adapt itself to the facts of modern\r\nGerman life. The vague phrases of its republican programme, survivals from\r\na past epoch of European thought, have attracted to it a large mass of\r\ninarticulate discontent which it has never been able to weld into a party\r\nof practical reformers. In the municipal sphere and in the field of Trade\r\nUnionism, under the education of responsibility, German Socialism can show\r\ngreat achievements; but in national policy it has been as helpless as the\r\nrest of the German nation.\r\n\r\nWhat effect, it will be asked, is the war of 1914 likely to have on the\r\nGerman working-class movement? In 1848 middle-class Germany made its stand\r\nfor democracy. May we hope for a similar and more successful movement,\r\nin the direction of Western ideals and methods of government, from\r\nworking-class Germany as a result of 1914?\r\n\r\nIt is a tempting prophecy; but the outlook is not propitious. Germany,\r\nPrussian and South German, noble, bourgeois, and working class, has rallied\r\nround the Emperor in this crisis of national history, as the brutal and\r\ncynical directors of German policy calculated that she would. For the\r\nSocial Democratic Movement the war comes with a peculiar appeal. It is a\r\nwar against Russia, a country about which the German workman knows little\r\nand understands less, but which he considers to be the home of a reaction\r\nfar blacker than that of his own country. A war of aggression against\r\nthe Western Powers would have found the Social Democrats divided. By\r\nrepresenting Russia as the aggressor and the Western Powers as the\r\nshameless allies of the \"Mongol,\" German diplomacy, more successful within\r\nthan without, made certain of enlisting Socialist support.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Socialists too have to pass through a natural reaction from\r\ntheir refusal to recognise the forces of Nationality--from Utopian dreams\r\nof international action by the peoples across the barriers of separate\r\ngovernments. For the first time in the history of the party, German\r\nSocialism has been allowed to be patriotic. It is an exhilarating and\r\nheartening experience, and it is certain to leave an indelible mark upon\r\nthe spirit of the movement. The great party organisation, hitherto confined\r\nto the sterile work of agitation, is being used to cope with the many\r\nproblems created by the war; and this work, rather than revolutionary\r\nagitation, is likely to occupy it for some time to come.\r\n\r\nA veil has fallen upon Germany: German books and papers are stopped at our\r\nports: we cannot know through what thoughts the German nation is passing.\r\nBut as we look with the mind's eye across the North Sea, past devastated\r\nBelgium to the populous towns of industrial Germany, we see a people\r\nskilful, highly instructed, and mechanically intelligent, yet equally\r\ndevoid either of personal initiative or of great and inspiring leadership.\r\nTwo generations of Prussian education have left German public life\r\npractically empty of names of more than local reputation. Great changes are\r\nneeded--a change of institutions and a change of spirit; yet whence this\r\nwill come we cannot divine. Only, as democrats, we can say with confidence\r\nthat if the true spirit of the German people is to be liberated from its\r\nlong imprisonment, its freedom must be won, not from without, but from\r\nwithin. Not Europe but only the Germans can make Germany herself again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nBOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\n1. GERMAN HISTORY\r\n\r\nBRYCE. _Holy Roman Empire_.

They seem to indicate two\r\ndevelopments in German opinion.\r\n\r\n(1) A great consolidation of German national unity (except, of course, in\r\nPoland and Alsace-Lorraine).\r\n\r\n(2) A tendency to forgo the consideration of the immediate issues and to\r\nhark back in thought to 1870 or even to the Wars of Liberation. It\r\nis difficult to judge of a nation in arms from the writings of its\r\nstay-at-homes; but no one can read recent articles by the leaders of German\r\nthought without feeling that the Germans are still, before all things and\r\nincurably, \"the people of poets and philosophers,\" and that, by a tragic\r\nirony, it is the best and most characteristic qualities of the race which\r\nare sustaining and will continue to sustain it in the conflict in which its\r\ndreams have involved it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nAUSTRIA-HUNGARY AND THE SOUTHERN SLAVS\r\n\r\n\"For a century past attempts have been made to solve the Eastern Question.\r\nOn the day when it appears to have been solved Europe will inevitably be\r\nconfronted by the Austrian Question.\"--ALBERT SOREL (1902).\r\n\r\n\r\nIn April 1909, a week after the international crisis evoked by Austria's\r\nannexation of Bosnia had come to an end, I paid my first visit to Cetinje,\r\nthe tiny mountain-capital of Montenegro, and was assured by the Premier,\r\nDr. Tomanovi, that the conflict had merely been postponed, not averted--a\r\nfact which even then was obvious enough. \"But remember,\" he said, \"it is\r\na question of _Aut aut_ (either, or)--either Serbia and Montenegro or\r\nAustria-Hungary. One or other has got to go, and you may rest assured that\r\nin four, or at most five, years from now there will be a European war over\r\nthis very question.\" At the time I merely regarded his prophecy as a proof\r\nof Serb megalomania, but it has been literally fulfilled.\r\n\r\nIn 1908-1909 Austria-Hungary, with the aid of her German ally, enforced\r\nher wishes in respect of Bosnia upon a reluctant Europe; but instead of\r\nfollowing up this success by a determined effort to solve the Southern Slav\r\nquestion on an Austrian basis, she allowed the confusion to grow yearly\r\nworse confounded, and gradually created an intolerable situation from\r\nwhich a peaceful exit was well-nigh impossible. The actual event which\r\nprecipitated the struggle, the event from which the diplomatic contest of\r\nlast July, and thus the great war, first proceeded, was the assassination\r\nof the Archduke Francis Ferdinand and his wife at Sarajevo on June 28 and\r\nthe consequent acute friction between Austria-Hungary and Serbia. But the\r\nmurder, as will be shown later, was merely made the pretext for Austria's\r\ndeclaration of war. The real causes lie far deeper, and can only be\r\nproperly understood on the basis of an historical survey.\r\n\r\nMy apology for inflicting so many unfamiliar details upon the reader is\r\nthat the key to the whole situation lies in Austria-Hungary, and that upon\r\nthe fate of its provinces and races in this war depends to a very great\r\nextent the question whether the new Europe which is to issue from this\r\nfiery ordeal is to be better than the old Europe which is crumbling in\r\nruins before our eyes. For the moment a thick fog of war obscures this\r\npoint of view; but the time will assuredly come when it will emerge in its\r\ntrue perspective.\r\n\r\nIn recent years it had become a cheap journalistic commonplace to refer to\r\nthe coming \"inevitable\" struggle between Teuton and Slav, and the present\r\nwar is no doubt widely regarded as proving the correctness of this theory,\r\ndespite the fact that the two chief groups of Teutons are ranged on\r\nopposite sides, and that the Slavs enjoy the active support of Celts and\r\nLatins also. That such a struggle has come, is in the last resort due to\r\nthe false conceptions of Nationality which underly the policy of the two\r\ncentral Powers, Germany and Austria-Hungary. The freedom from foreign\r\noppression which the Germans so nobly vindicated against Napoleon has not\r\nbeen extended to their own subject races, the Poles, Danes, and Lorrainers;\r\nand recent years have seen the accentuation of a conflict the germs\r\nof which may be detected as far back as the fatal crime of the Polish\r\nPartition in the eighteenth century. The policy of Germanisation in Austria\r\nhas been gradually undermined by causes which it would take too long to\r\nenumerate, but its sting has survived in the maintenance of a foreign\r\npolicy which treats 26,000,000 Slavs as a mere _annexe_ of militant\r\nGermanism and as \"gun-fodder\" for the designs of Berlin; while in Hungary\r\nthe parallel policy of Magyarisation has increased in violence from year\r\nto year, poisoning the wells of public opinion, creating a gulf of hatred\r\nbetween the Magyars and their subject races (the Slovaks, Roumanians,\r\nCroats, Serbs, etc.), and rendering cordial relations with the neighbouring\r\nBalkan States impossible. Nor is it a mere accident that official Germany\r\nand official Hungary should have pursued an actively Turcophil policy; for\r\nthe same tendencies have been noticeable in Turkey, though naturally in a\r\nsomewhat cruder form than farther west. Just as the Young Turk policy\r\nof Turkification rendered a war between Turkey and the Balkan States\r\ninevitable, so the policy of Magyarisation pursued by two generations of\r\nHungarian statesmen sowed the seeds of war between Austria and the Southern\r\nSlavs. In the former case it was possible to isolate the conflict, in the\r\nlatter it has involved the greater part of Europe in a common disaster.\r\n\r\nThe struggle centres round the Austro-Serbian dispute. Let us then attempt\r\na brief survey of the two countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. _Austria and the Habsburgs_.--Let us begin with Austria-Hungary. In\r\nthis country many misconceptions prevail regarding Austria-Hungary; nor is\r\nthis surprising, for it is unique among States, and whether we regard it\r\nfrom a political, a constitutional, a racial, or a social point of view,\r\nthe issues are equally complicated and difficult to sum up. With the aid\r\nof a good gazetteer it is easy enough to elicit the facts that the\r\nAustria-Hungary of to-day is a state of fifty-two million inhabitants,\r\ndivided into three component parts: _(a)_ the Empire of Austria, _(b)_ the\r\nKingdom of Hungary, each with subdivisions which will be referred to later,\r\nand _(c)_ the annexed provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina, jointly administered\r\nby the two Governments. But this bald fact is meaningless except in\r\nconnection with the historical genesis of the Habsburg State.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUSTRIA-HUNGARY; PHYSICAL]\r\n\r\nAustria--_Oesterreich_--is the ancient Eastmark or frontier province, the\r\noutpost of Carlovingian power against the tribes of the east, then of\r\nthe mediaeval German Empire against Slav and Magyar. Under the House of\r\nHabsburg, which first rose to greatness on the ruins of a Greater Bohemia,\r\nAustria grew steadily stronger as a distinct unit. Two famous mottoes sum\r\nup the policy of that dynasty in the earlier centuries of its existence.\r\n_Austriae est Imperare Orbi Universo_ (Austria's it is to Rule the\r\nUniverse) ran the device of that canny Frederick III., who, amid much\r\nadversity, laid the plans which prompted an equally striking epigram about\r\nhis son and successor Maximilian, the \"Last of the Knights\"--_Bella gerant\r\nalii, tu, felix Austria, nube_ (Let others wage war; do thou marry, O\r\nfortunate Austria!). There were three great stages in Habsburg marriage\r\npolicy. In 1479 Maximilian married the heiress of Charles the Bold, thus\r\nacquiring the priceless dowry of the Low Countries (what are now Belgium\r\nand Holland). In 1506 his son Philip added the crown of Spain and the\r\nIndies by his marriage with the heiress of Ferdinand and Isabella. In\r\n1526, when the battle of Mohács placed Hungary at the mercy of the Turks,\r\nMaximilian's grandson Ferdinand, in his wife's name, united Bohemia,\r\nHungary, and Croatia with the Austrian duchies.\r\n\r\nHenceforth for over two centuries Austria and Habsburg became the bulwark\r\nof Christendom against the Turks; though delayed by wars of religion and by\r\nthe excesses of religious bigotry, they yet never lost sight of the final\r\ngoal. Twice--at the beginning and at the end of this period, in 1527 and\r\n1683--the Turks were before the very walls of Vienna, but the second of\r\nthese occasions represents their final effort. In the closing years of the\r\nseventeenth and the first two decades of the eighteenth centuries the tide\r\nfinally rolled back against them. Foremost among the victors stands out the\r\ngreat name of Prince Eugene, comrade-in-arms of our own Marlborough, whose\r\nsong, \"Prinz Eugen, der edle Ritter\" (Prince Eugene, the noble Knight),\r\nhas been sung in July and August 1914 on the streets of Vienna, just as\r\n\"Marlbrook s'en va-t-en guerre\" might be sung by our Belgian allies. The\r\npeace of 1718 represents Habsburg's farthest advance southwards; Belgrade\r\nand half of present-day Serbia owned allegiance to Vienna. Then came the\r\ncheck of 1739, when these conquests were restored to the Sultan. Due merely\r\nto incompetent generals, it need not have been permanent, had not Frederick\r\nthe Great created a diversion from the north. By the time that the War of\r\nAustrian Succession and the Seven Years' War were over, that expansion\r\nsouthwards which had seemed so certain was irrevocably postponed. The\r\norganisation of fresh \"Military Frontiers,\" the colonisation of waste lands\r\nin South Hungary--all was admirable so far as it went, but was already a\r\ndefensive rather than an offensive measure. Meanwhile a formidable rival\r\nappeared in the shape of the Russian colossus, and the history of two\r\ncenturies is dominated by Austro-Russian rivalry in the Balkans. Here\r\nwe are confronted by the first of those lost opportunities in which the\r\nhistory of modern Austria is unhappily so rich.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century Austria became, as it were, the chief home\r\nof bureaucratic government, first under Maria Theresa, one of the greatest\r\nwomen-sovereigns, then under her son Joseph II. A series of \"enlightened\r\nexperiments\" in government, typical of the age of Voltaire and of\r\nFrederick, and honestly conducted _for_ the people, though never _by_ the\r\npeople, ended as such experiments are apt to end, in failure. The most that\r\ncan be said is that the bureaucratic machine had become more firmly fixed\r\nin the groove which it was henceforth to occupy.\r\n\r\nThe failure of Joseph II. was above all due to his inability to recognise\r\nthe meaning of Nationality, to his attempt to apply Germanisation as the\r\none infallible remedy for all internal difficulties in his dominions. The\r\nidea of Nationality, already gaining strength, obtained a fresh impetus\r\nfrom the French Revolution. While in the west it sowed the seeds of United\r\nItaly and United Germany, which the nineteenth century was to bring to\r\nfruition, in the Balkans it stirred waters which had seemed dead for\r\ncenturies, and led to the uprising of the Serbs and Greeks, then of the\r\nRoumanians, and finally a generation later of the Bulgarians. In the\r\nHabsburg dominions the same movement revealed itself in the revival of\r\nnational feeling in Hungary, Bohemia, and Croatia, but nowhere more\r\nstrongly than in Hungary, where it was accompanied by a remarkable literary\r\nrevival and the appearance of a group of Magyar poets of real genius.\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom of Hungary, which from 1526 to 1687 had been partially under\r\nTurkish rule, led a vegetable existence during the eighteenth century. This\r\nlull was a necessary period of recuperation after exhausting wars.\r\nThe ancient Hungarian constitution, dating in its essentials from the\r\nthirteenth century, but fallen on evil days during the Turkish era, now\r\ncame more and more out of abeyance. Its fundamental principles were\r\nreaffirmed by the famous laws of Leopold II. (1790-92), and after a further\r\nrelapse due to the Napoleonic wars, a long series of constitutional and\r\nlinguistic reforms were introduced by successive parliaments between 1825\r\nand 1848.\r\n\r\nWithout entering into a discussion of the Hungarian constitution, it is\r\nwell to point out one factor which lies at the root of all political and\r\nconstitutional development in Hungary and explains the Magyar outlook\r\nfor centuries past, even up to the present day. Till 1840 Latin was the\r\nofficial language of the country, and in that Latin the term for the\r\npolitical nation was _Populus_, which we would naturally translate as\r\npeople. But populus contrasted in Hungarian law with plebs, the _misera\r\nplebs contribuens,_ that phrase of ominous meaning to describe the mass of\r\nthe oppressed and unenfranchised people, the populus being the nobles, a\r\ncaste which was relatively very wide, but none the less a caste, and which\r\nenjoyed a monopoly of all political power. Till 1848 only the populus could\r\nvote, only the plebs could pay taxes--a delightful application of the\r\nprinciple, \"Heads I win, tails you lose!\" In 1848 the distinction was\r\nbroken down in theory, the franchise being extended beyond the privileged\r\nclass by the initiative of that class itself. But in effect the distinction\r\nhas survived to the present day in a veiled form. Political power, and,\r\nabove all, the parliamentary franchise and the county elective bodies,\r\ncontinued to be a monopoly--henceforth a monopoly of the Magyar nobility,\r\n_plus_ those classes whom they had assimilated and attached to their\r\ncause, _against_ the other races, forming more than half the population of\r\nHungary. This point of populus and plebs may seem at first sight somewhat\r\npedantic and technical; but in reality it is the key which explains the\r\nwhole social structure of Hungary, even its economic and agrarian problems.\r\n\r\nThe period from the death of Joseph II. to the great revolutionary movement\r\nof 1848 may be regarded, so far as eastern Europe is concerned, as a period\r\nwhen nationality is simmering everywhere. It is a period of preparation for\r\nthe rise of national States--ushered in by the great crime of the Polish\r\nPartition, to which so many modern evils may be traced, and closed by a\r\nsudden explosion which shook Europe from Paris to Budapest, from Palermo to\r\nBerlin. The first stage was of course the long Napoleonic war, during which\r\nthe seed was sown broadcast; the second, the era of reaction and political\r\nexhaustion (1815-1848), when all that was best in Europe concentrated in\r\nthe Romantic movement in literature, art, and music.\r\n\r\nFor Austria this period was bound up with the name of Metternich, who\r\npersonified the old hide-bound methods of the bureaucracy, the diplomacy of\r\na past age, to which the nations were mere pawns on a chessboard. Under him\r\nthe \"Police-State\" assumed its most perfect form, a form not even surpassed\r\nby Russia from 1881 to 1905.\r\n\r\nThen came the year 1848, when the dams burst. The Hungarian constitution,\r\nrestored in its entirety, became for a time the watchword and inspirer\r\nof the movement, while Austria for the first time received a serious\r\nconstitution. Unhappily the issue between Reaction and Progress was not\r\na clear one. The Magyars in Hungary unquestionably stood for historic\r\ndevelopment and constitutional rights, but they also stood for racial\r\nhegemony, for the forcible assimilation of all the other races, for a\r\nunitary Magyar State instead of the old polyglot Hungary. They thus\r\ndrove all the other races to coalesce with the dynasty and the forces of\r\nreaction. The result was a violent racial war, with all kinds of excesses.\r\nSlovaks, Croats, Serbs, Roumanians, Saxons, all fought against the Magyars,\r\nand finally the scale was turned by the Russian troops who poured across\r\nthe Carpathians in the name of outraged autocracy.\r\n\r\nThere followed the inevitable reaction, which again can be best summed up\r\nin two phrases--that of Prince Felix Schwarzenberg, \"Austria will astonish\r\nthe world by her ingratitude,\" so strikingly fulfilled in the Crimean War,\r\nwhen Austria left Russia in the lurch; and that of a Hungarian patriot,\r\n\"The other races have received as reward what we Magyars receive as\r\npunishment.\" In short, the statesmen of Vienna, untaught by experience,\r\nreverted to the old bureaucratic and absolutist _régime_.\r\n\r\nFor ten years (1849-1859) this endured--Clericalism rampant, financial\r\nruin, stagnation everywhere. Then Nationality burst its bonds once more.\r\nThe war with Napoleon III. ended in Austria's loss of Lombardy and the\r\ncreation of the Italian kingdom. Faced by the bankruptcy of the whole\r\npolitical and financial system, Francis Joseph launched into a period of\r\nconstitutional experiment. Following the line of least resistance,\r\nas throughout his long reign, he inclined now to federalism, now to\r\ncentralism, and he was still experimenting when the war of 1866 broke out.\r\nFor Austria this war was decisive, for its results were her final expulsion\r\nboth from Germany and from Italy, and the creation of that fatal Dual\r\nSystem which has distorted her whole subsequent development.\r\n\r\nUnder the Ausgleich or Compromise of 1867 the Dual Monarchy is composed of\r\ntwo equal and separate States, the Empire of Austria and the Kingdom of\r\nHungary, each possessing a distinct parliament and cabinet of its own, but\r\nboth sharing between them the three Joint Ministries of Foreign Affairs,\r\nWar, and Finance. The chiefs of these three offices are equally responsible\r\nto both Delegations, which are committees of the two Parliaments, sitting\r\nalternately in Vienna and Budapest, but acting quite independently of each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThis system really secured the political power in Austria and Hungary to\r\ntwo races--the Germans and the Magyars, and they, as the strongest in each\r\ncountry, bought off the two next strongest, the Poles and the Croats, by\r\nthe grant of autonomy to Galicia and Croatia. The remaining eight were not\r\nconsidered at all. At first this ingenious device seemed to offer fair\r\nprospects of success. But ere long--for reasons which would lead us too\r\nfar--the German hegemony broke down in Austria, and the whole balance was\r\ndisturbed. It gradually became clear that the system was only workable when\r\none scale was high in the air. The history of the past forty-seven years is\r\nthe history of the gradual decay of the Dual System. Austria has progressed\r\nin many ways; her institutions have steadily grown freer, her political\r\nsense has developed, universal suffrage has been introduced, racial\r\ninequalities have been reduced though not abolished, industry, art, and\r\ngeneral culture have advanced steadily. But she has been continually\r\nhampered by Hungary, where racial monopoly has grown worse and worse. The\r\nMagyar Chauvinists attempted the impossible--the assimilation by seven\r\nmillion people of twelve million others. Yet in spite of every imaginable\r\ntrick--a corrupt and oppressive administration, gross manipulation of the\r\nfranchise, press persecution, the suppression of schools and ruthless\r\nrestriction of every form of culture--the non-Magyar races are stronger\r\nto-day than in 1867. And the result of the struggle has been in Hungary a\r\ndecay of political standards, a corruption of public life, such as fills\r\neven the greatest optimists with despair.\r\n\r\n\r\n§2. _Hungary and Magyar Misrule_.--Such an assertion may seem to run\r\ncounter to the common idea of Hungary as the home of liberty and the\r\nvanguard of popular uprisings against despotism, and it is certainly\r\nincompatible with the arrogant claim of Magyar Statesmen that \"nowhere\r\nin the world is there so much freedom as in Hungary.\" At the risk of\r\ndisturbing the proportion of this chapter, I propose to give a few classic\r\nillustrations of Magyar methods, selected almost at random from an\r\noverwhelming mass of damning evidence.\r\n\r\nOn paper Hungary possesses a most admirable and enlightened law\r\nguaranteeing \"the Equal Rights of Nationalities\" (1868); in practice, it\r\nhas remained almost from the very first a dead letter. Let us take the\r\nfield of education. Every effort, legal and illegal, has been made to\r\nMagyarise the educational system, with the result that in all the primary\r\nand secondary schools under State control Magyar is the exclusive language\r\nof instruction, while the number of denominational schools has been\r\nsteadily diminished and their sphere of action, as more favourable to the\r\nnon-Magyar races, materially restricted. Fifty years ago the Slovaks, who\r\neven then numbered over two millions, possessed three gymnasia (middle\r\nschools) which they had founded and maintained by their own exertions.\r\nIn 1875 all three were arbitrarily closed by orders of the Hungarian\r\nGovernment, and since that date the unhappy Slovaks have not been allowed\r\na single secondary school in which their own language is taught, while the\r\nnumber of their primary schools has been reduced from 1821 in 1869 to 440\r\nin 1911. The deliberate aim is, of course, to prevent the growth of a\r\nSlovak middle class. It is quite a common thing for schoolboys to be\r\npersecuted or even dismissed for showing Slovak proclivities or even\r\ntalking their mother--tongue \"ostentatiously\" on the street. Only last year\r\na brilliant young Slovak student, known to me personally, was deprived by\r\nthe Magyar authorities of a scholarship in Oriental languages, for no\r\nother reason than that he was \"untrustworthy in a national sense\"![1]\r\nSuch instances are even more frequent among the Roumanians of Hungary.\r\nA specially notorious case occurred in March 1912 at Grosswardein, when\r\nsixteen Roumanian theological students were expelled from the Catholic\r\nseminary for the \"demonstrative use\" of their language, which was regarded\r\nas offensive by their fellow-students and professors!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This document is in my possession.]\r\n\r\nLinguistic restrictions are carried to outrageous lengths. There is not\r\na single inscription in any language save Magyar in any post office or\r\nrailway station throughout Hungary. Slovak medals and stamps, produced\r\nin America and bearing such treasonable inscriptions as \"For our Slovak\r\nlanguage\" and \"I am proud to be a Slovak,\" have been confiscated in\r\nHungary. Only Magyar inscriptions are tolerated on the tombstones of the\r\nBudapest cemeteries. The erection of monuments to Roumanian or Slovak\r\npatriots has more than once been prohibited, and the funds collected have\r\nbeen arbitrarily seized and applied to Magyar purposes. National colours,\r\nother than the Magyar, are strictly forbidden. Two years ago, at the\r\nfuneral of a Roumanian poet at Kronstadt (Transylvania) gendarmes pressed\r\nup to the hearse and clipped off the colours from a wreath which had been\r\nsent by the Society of Journalists in Bucarest. About the same time a nurse\r\nwas sent to prison because a child of three was found wearing a Roumanian\r\ntricolor bow, and its parents were reprimanded and fined. Last July on the\r\nvery eve of war, fifteen theological students, returning to Bucarest from\r\nan excursion into Transylvania, were arrested at the frontier by Hungarian\r\ngendarmes, hauled by main force out of the train, sent back to Hermannstadt\r\nand kept for days in gaol; their offence consisted in waving some Roumanian\r\ntricolors from the train windows as they steamed out of the last station in\r\nHungary!\r\n\r\nNo law of association exists in Hungary, and the government uses its\r\narbitrary powers to prohibit or suppress even such harmless organisations\r\nas temperance societies, choral unions, or women's leagues. Perhaps the\r\nmost notorious examples are the dissolution of the Slovak Academy in\r\n1875 and of the Roumanian National Party's organisation in 1894; but the\r\ntreatment meted out to trades unions and working-class organisations, both\r\nMagyar and non-Magyar, for years past, has been equally scandalous. The\r\nright of assembly is no less precarious in a country where parliamentary\r\ncandidates are arrested or expelled from their constituencies, where\r\ndeputies are prevented from addressing their constituents, where an\r\nelectoral address is often treated as a penal offence.\r\n\r\nAs for Hungary's electoral system, the less said the better.\r\nGerrymandering, a narrow and complicated franchise, bribery and corruption\r\non a gigantic scale, the wholesale use of troops and gendarmes to prevent\r\nopposition voters from reaching the polls, the cooking of electoral rolls,\r\nillegal disqualifications, sham counts, official terrorism, and in many\r\ncases actual bloodshed--such are but a few of the methods which preserve a\r\npolitical monopoly in the hands of a corrupt and increasingly inefficient\r\nracial oligarchy, in a country where the absence of the ballot places the\r\npeasant peculiarly at the mercy of the authorities. Small wonder, then, if\r\nthe non-Magyar races of Hungary, who on a basis of population would have\r\nhad 198 deputies, never were allowed to elect more than 25, and if even\r\nthis scanty number was at the infamous elections of 1910 reduced by\r\nterrorism and corruption to eight!\r\n\r\nIn judicial matters the situation is no less galling. Petitions are\r\nnot accepted in the courts, unless drawn up in Magyar, and the whole\r\nproceedings are invariably conducted in the same language. The non-Magyar\r\n\"stands like an ox\" before the courts of his native land, and a whole\r\nseries of provisions exists for his repression, notably the monstrous\r\nparagraphs dealing with \"action hostile to the State,\" with the \"incitement\r\nof one nationality against another\" and with the \"glorification of a\r\ncriminal action\"--applied with rigorous severity to all political opponents\r\nof Magyarisation but never to its advocates. Let me cite one classic\r\nexample of the latter. In 1898 a well-known Slovak editor was sentenced\r\nto eight months' imprisonment for two articles severely criticising the\r\nMagyarisation of place-names in Hungary. On his return from prison he\r\nwas met at the railway station of the little county town by a crowd of\r\nadmirers: songs were sung, a short speech of welcome was delivered and a\r\nbouquet of flowers was presented. The sequel of this perfectly orderly\r\nincident was that no fewer than twenty-four persons, including Mr. Hurban\r\nthe leading Slovak poet, were sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying\r\nfrom fourteen days to six months. The three girls who had presented the\r\nflowers were let off with a fine of £16.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the reader will regard me as a very dangerous conspirator, when I\r\ntell him that in June 1910 an old lady of seventy-three, the widow of a\r\nhigh-school headmaster, was fined £4 because I had called at her house for\r\ntwenty minutes on election day without its being notified to the police,\r\nand that in June 1914 an enquiry was instituted by the local authorities\r\nagainst some Slovak friends who had entertained me to luncheon! And yet I\r\ncan honestly assert that I have never been guilty of any worse crime than\r\nCaptain Grose, of whom Burns warned my countrymen a hundred years ago in\r\nthe famous line:\r\n\r\n              A chiel's amang ye takin' notes!\r\n\r\nThe fabric of Magyar rule is far too rotten and corrupt to regard with\r\nequanimity any extensive note-taking on the part of the outer world.\r\n\r\nWhole books might be written to illustrate the contention that in matters\r\nof education, administration, and justice, of association and assembly, of\r\nthe franchise and the press, the non-Magyar nationalities of Hungary have\r\nlong been the victims of a policy of repression which is without any\r\nparallel in civilised Europe. It is this Magyar system, from which I have\r\nlifted but a corner of the veil, that is one of the mainsprings of the\r\npresent war, and if there is to be a new and healthy Europe in the future,\r\nthis system must be swept away root, branch and stock. To such lengths has\r\nnational fanaticism driven the Magyars that in 1906 it was possible for an\r\nex-Premier of Hungary, speaking in open Parliament amid the applause of the\r\nmajority, to lay down the following axiom: \"The legal State is the aim:\r\nbut with this question we can only concern ourselves when we have already\r\nassured the national State.... Hungary's interests demand its erection on\r\nthe most extreme Chauvinist lines.\" Men who applaud such a sentiment\r\nare worthy allies of those so-called statesmen who regard international\r\ntreaties as \"a mere scrap of paper.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§3. _The Decay of the Dual System_.--The radical divergence of political\r\ndevelopment in Austria and in Hungary, its paralysing effect upon the\r\nforeign policy of the Monarchy as a whole, coupled with the growth\r\nof national feeling among the minor nationalities and their steady\r\nemancipation from the economic thraldom of the German and the Jew--all this\r\nhas slowly but surely undermined the Dual System and rendered its final\r\ncollapse inevitable. Indeed for some time past it has merely owed its\r\nsurvival to the old age of the Emperor, who has a natural reluctance to\r\ndestroy his own creation. For some years it has been known that his heir,\r\nFrancis Ferdinand, was the advocate of far-reaching changes, which would\r\nhave taken the form of a compromise between a federalist and a centralist\r\nsystem. His abrupt removal from the scene was secretly welcomed by all\r\nthose whose political and racial monopoly was bound up with the existing\r\n_régime_.\r\n\r\nGerman dominance in Austria, it should be added, meant a close alliance\r\nwith the German Empire; and every fresh effort of the subject races to\r\nemancipate themselves from Germanising or Magyarising tendencies forged the\r\nchains of the alliance closer and increased the dependence of the Magyar\r\noligarchy upon Berlin. As in mediaeval times, so in the twentieth century\r\nHabsburg policy is explained by two famous Latin mottoes--_Viribus unitis_\r\n(\"Union is strength\") and _Divide et impera_ (\"Divide and rule\"). Between\r\nthese two watchwords Francis Joseph and his advisers have wavered for\r\nsixty-five years.\r\n\r\nWhat then are the forces which have held Austria-Hungary together under\r\nFrancis Joseph? First unquestionably comes the dynasty; for it would be\r\ndifficult to over-estimate the power exercised by the dynastic tradition on\r\nthe many races under Habsburg sway. Next comes the Joint Army; for there is\r\nno finer body of men in Europe than the Austrian officers' corps, poorly\r\npaid, hard-worked, but inspired to the last man with unbounded devotion to\r\nthe Imperial house, and to a large extent immune from that spirit of caste\r\nwhich is the most offensive feature of the allied German army.[1] Hardly\r\nless important are the Catholic Church, with its vast material resources\r\nand its powerful influence on peasant, small tradesman and court alike,\r\nand the bureaucracy, with its traditions of red tape, small-mindedness,\r\nslowness of movement and genial _Gemütlichkeit_ (\"easy-goingness\"). It is\r\nonly _after_ these forces that we can fairly count the parliaments and\r\nrepresentative government. And yet there are no fewer than twenty-three\r\nlegislative bodies in the Monarchy--the two central parliaments of Vienna\r\nand Budapest, entirely distinct from each other; the two Delegations; the\r\nprovincial Diets, seventeen in Austria, one in Croatia; and the Diet of\r\nBosnia, whose every legislative act requires the ratification of the Joint\r\nMinister of Finance and of the Austrian and Hungarian Governments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is in no way a \"preserve\" of the aristocracy, being largely\r\nrecruited from the middle and even lower-middle class.]\r\n\r\nAgainst all this there is one supremely disintegrating force--the principle\r\nof Nationality.

Let us now consider her\r\nrival in the dispute which has led to the great war--Serbia.\r\n\r\nHere, at the outset, it cannot be emphasised too strongly that those who\r\nregard the problem merely as a dispute between the government of Vienna and\r\nthe government of Belgrade have not grasped even its elements. The Southern\r\nSlav question goes far deeper and wider than that; it must be treated as a\r\nwhole, and of it Serbia is only a part. In any study of the Slavonic races\r\nthe first fact which emerges is that they fall naturally into two main\r\ngroups--the northern and the southern--divided by a solid wedge of three\r\nnon-Slavonic races, the German, the Magyar, and the Roumanian, stretching\r\nfrom the Kiel Canal to the Black Sea. It is with the southern group that we\r\nare concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Southern Slavs fall into four sections--the Slovenes, Croats, Serbs,\r\nand Bulgars, who between them occupy the whole country from southern\r\nCarinthia to central Thrace. The significance of the Bulgars will be dealt\r\nwith elsewhere, and of the Slovenes it will suffice for our present purpose\r\nto say that they are a small and ancient race, of vigorous stock and\r\nclerical leanings, whose true importance lies in their geographical\r\nposition and its latent possibilities for the future. The Croats and Serbs\r\noccupy the border-line between West and East, between Rome and Byzantium,\r\nbetween Catholicism and Orthodoxy. Broadly speaking, every Croat is a\r\nCatholic, every Serb an Orthodox. Broadly speaking again, the Croat\r\nlanguage is Serb written with Latin characters, the Serb language Croat\r\nwritten in the Cyrilline alphabet.\r\n\r\nDespite their common language, the two kindred races have never all been\r\nunited under a single ruler. From the ninth to the end of the eleventh\r\ncentury the Duchy, then Kingdom, of Croatia was governed by native princes,\r\nupon whose extinction it was conquered by Hungary. For eight centuries\r\nCroatia has enjoyed an autonomous position under the Holy Crown of St.\r\nStephen; its scope has varied according to the political constellation,\r\nbut till 1912 its constant tradition had remained unbroken. Meanwhile the\r\nDalmatian coast towns remained a bone of contention between Venice and\r\nHungary; but the marble Lions on their battered walls are still the best\r\nproof of the triumph of Italian culture within them. Ragusa alone resisted\r\nboth Venetians and Turks, and preserved herself inviolate as the home of\r\ncommerce and the muses, until her tiny Republic was destroyed by Napoleon\r\nin 1808. The Kingdom of Serbia developed on more distinctively Slavonic\r\nlines. During its great days in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries\r\nunder the Nemanja dynasty it dominated the Balkan Peninsula, produced a\r\ncode of law which is unique in mediaeval records, developed a prosperous\r\ncommerce and mining industries, and seemed on the point of striking a new\r\nnote in architecture. Her greatest Tsar, Stephen Dushan, died mysteriously\r\nof poison, when his hosts were already thundering at the gates of\r\nConstantinople (1356). But the greatness of his empire did not survive him,\r\nand only a generation later Serbian independence received its death-blow\r\non the fatal field of Kosovo--the Flodden of the Balkans, but an event\r\nfar direr in its consequences than Flodden was to Scotland. Bosnia and a\r\nfragment of Serbia lingered on under more or less independent rulers till\r\nthe middle of the fifteenth century. Then the Turkish night replaced the\r\nTurkish twilight. From 1463 to 1804 the national life of the Serbs lay\r\nutterly crushed. In Serbia their nobility was literally wiped out, in\r\nBosnia it accepted Islam in order to save its lands. The relations of\r\nconqueror and conquered are best characterised by the single fact that\r\na Christian who failed to dismount from his horse on meeting a Turk was\r\nliable to be killed on the spot.\r\n\r\nThroughout this period of utter gloom only two things served to keep alive\r\nthe Serb tradition--their splendid popular ballads, unequalled in Europe\r\nfor directness and imagination, save, perhaps, by the ballads of the\r\nAnglo-Scottish Border; and the clergy of the Orthodox Church, poor ignorant\r\ndespised peasants like their flock, yet bravely keeping the national flame\r\nburning. The one bright spot was the tiny mountain eyrie of Montenegro,\r\nwhich stubbornly maintained its freedom under a long succession of\r\nwarrior-priests.\r\n\r\nThe Serb Patriarchate, which had long had its seat in Ipek, migrated to\r\nAustria in 1690, at the special invitation of the Emperor Leopold I., and\r\nhas ever since been established (though the title of patriarch lapsed for a\r\ntime) at Karlowitz on the Danube. Large settlements of refugee Serbs from\r\nTurkey followed their spiritual chief to Croatia, Slavonia and the southern\r\nplains of Hungary between 1690 and 1740. The special privileges granted to\r\nthem by the emperor were, however, gradually undermined and revoked by the\r\nHungarian Estates. Meanwhile the \"Military Frontiers\" were extended on\r\nessentially democratic lines: a land-tenure subject to military service\r\nbred a hereditary race of soldiers and officers devoted to the Imperial\r\nidea, and it has taken many long long years of bungling on the part of\r\nViennese and Magyar diplomacy to efface that devotion.\r\n\r\nThus the Habsburg dominions became the centre of culture for the Serbs,\r\nwhose literary revival came from Neusatz, Karlowitz and even Buda. It was\r\nnot only under Prince Eugene that they looked to the Habsburgs for aid.\r\nKara George, who led their first serious rising in 1804 more than once\r\noffered himself to Vienna.\r\n\r\nIn the Balkans the Serbs were the first to revolt, and won their own\r\nfreedom, with less help than Greeks, Roumanians or Bulgarians, and under\r\nfar less favourable circumstances. Thus Serbia is essentially a self-made\r\nman among States, built from the foundations upwards, and possessing no\r\naristocracy and hardly even a middle class. Her curse has been the rivalry\r\nof two, or rather three native dynasties, the Karageorgevitch, the\r\nObrenovitch and the Petrovitch; and this rivalry has borne fruit in three\r\ndastardly political crimes--the murder of the heroic Black George in 1817,\r\nby order of his rival Milosh Obrenovitch; of Prince Michael, Serbia's\r\nwisest ruler, by the adherents of George's son; and finally of King\r\nAlexander and his wife in June 1903. The history of the Southern Slavs\r\nfor the last century has been a slow movement towards national unity,\r\novershadowed, sometimes hastened, sometimes paralysed, by the rivalry of\r\nAustria and Russia for the hegemony of the Balkan Peninsula. Till 1875 the\r\ninfluence of the two Powers alternated in Belgrade, and there was nothing\r\ndefinite to suggest which influence would win, though of course Russia may\r\nbe said to have possessed an advantage in her position as the foremost\r\nOrthodox power and as the greatest among the Slavonic brotherhood of races.\r\nThat year, however, brought a fresh rising of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nagainst Turkish rule, and in defence of this purely Serbo-Croat province\r\npublic opinion in Serbia and Montenegro rose. Side by side the two little\r\nprincipalities fought the Turks and risked their all upon the issue. The\r\nprovinces were to the last man friendly and welcomed their action. Then,\r\nwhen the battle seemed won, Austria-Hungary at the Congress of Berlin\r\nstepped in and occupied Bosnia and Herzegovina--with the active approval\r\nof Disraeli and Salisbury. The inhabitants resisted stoutly, but were\r\novercome. Thus was realised the first stage upon the road of the Austrian\r\nadvance towards Salonica. Serbia received compensation at Nia\u0001, Pirot, and\r\nVranja; Montenegro acquired the open roadstead of Antivari and a scrap of\r\nbarren coast-line; but the hearts of both still clung to Bosnia.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the friction between Vienna and Belgrade has been permanent,\r\nthough often latent. It was accentuated by the fact that King Milan was\r\nlittle better than an Austrian agent, the most notorious example of this\r\nbeing the ill-considered and ill-managed war with Bulgaria into which he\r\nplunged Serbia at the instigation of the Ballplatz[1](1885). Afterwards, it\r\nis true, Vienna intervened to rob the Bulgarians of the fruits of victory\r\nand argued that Serbia was thus under her debt; but this crass application\r\nof the principle of _divide et impera_ could not deceive any one. Milan was\r\na man of great ability, but vicious and corrupt. The ceaseless scandals\r\nof his private life, the frequent political _coups d'etat_ in which\r\nhe indulged, tended to confirm the dislike of his subjects for the\r\nAustrophilism with which he was identified. Alexander, his son and\r\nsuccessor, was even worse; indeed, it is not too much to say that he was\r\nthe most \"impossible\" monarch whom Europe has known since the days of the\r\nTsar Paul. His court was characterised by gross favouritism and arbitrary\r\nrevisions of the constitution; and his position became finally untenable\r\nwhen he committed the fatal error of marrying Draga Mashin, a woman of no\r\nposition and notorious private character. Two incidents in her tragic story\r\nremind us of similar scandals in English history--the fond delusion of Mary\r\nTudor and the legend of Mary of Modena's warming-pan. The last straw was\r\nthe design, widely attributed to her and the infatuated king, for securing\r\nthe succession to her brother, who had as little claim to the throne as\r\nany other Serbian subject. On June 10, 1903, Alexander and Draga were\r\nassassinated by a gang of Serbian officers, under circumstances of the\r\nutmost brutality such as nothing can excuse. In the light of recent events,\r\nhowever, it is important to note that both Austria and Russia knew of the\r\nplot at least ten days before the murder and did nothing to stop it.[2]\r\nOn the day after the crime the _Fremdenblatt_, the organ of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Foreign Office, published a leading article couched in\r\nterms of the utmost cynicism, and declaring that it mattered little to\r\nAustria-Hungary which dynasty reigned in Serbia. The Serbian Government\r\nmight have been excused for enclosing a copy of this article in its reply\r\nto the Austrian Note of July 23, 1914!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Austro-Hungarian Foreign Office.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In 1908 this was confirmed to me by a distinguished member of\r\nthe then Austrian Cabinet, since dead, who was certainly in a position to\r\nknow.]\r\n\r\nThe Obrenovitch dynasty was thus at an end. Its rival, the Karageorgevitch\r\ndynasty, returned to power--naturally under a black cloud of European\r\ndisgust and suspicion. King Peter is not, however, as black as he has\r\nsometimes been painted. He fought gallantly in 1870 as a French officer; as\r\na young man he translated Stuart Mill's _Essay on Liberty_ into Serb, and\r\nfor a generation he lived by preference in democratic Geneva and in Paris.\r\nUnder him Serbia has for the first time enjoyed real constitutional\r\ngovernment. Quietly, as occasion arose, the regicides were removed to the\r\nbackground, the old methods of favouritism were steadily discouraged, and\r\nit is not too much to say that an entirely new atmosphere has been created\r\nin Belgrade since 1903. Among the younger politicians in Serbia, as in\r\nother Slavonic countries, the moral influence of Professor Masaryk, the\r\ngreat Czech philosopher and politician, has grown more and more marked.\r\n\r\nThe depth of Serb aspirations in Bosnia has two obvious grounds--on the one\r\nhand, pure national sentiment of the best kind; on the other, the urgent\r\neconomic need for a seaboard, Serbia being the only inland country in\r\nEurope save Switzerland, and not enjoying the latter's favoured position\r\nin the immediate vicinity of great world-markets. Austria-Hungary, on her\r\npart, set herself deliberately not merely to block this access to the sea,\r\nbut also to keep Serbia in complete economic dependence. Under the new\r\ndynasty the little kingdom showed a keener desire to shake off its\r\nvassalage and find new markets. The so-called \"Pig War\"--the breeding\r\nof swine is Serbia's staple industry, and the founders of her two rival\r\ndynasties were wealthy pig-breeders--proved an unexpected success, for new\r\ntrade outlets were found in Egypt and elsewhere. But the initial strain\r\nhit every peasant in his pocket and thus greatly accentuated the feeling\r\nagainst Austria-Hungary. At this stage came the Young Turk revolution and\r\nits sequel, the annexation of Bosnia. To any impartial observer it had been\r\nobvious from the first that those who dreamt of Austria-Hungary's voluntary\r\nwithdrawal from the two provinces were living in a fool's paradise. The\r\nformal act of annexation merely set a seal to thirty years of effective\r\nAustrian administration, during which the Sultan's rule had been confined\r\nto the official celebration of his birthday. Educational and agrarian\r\nproblems had been neglected, popular discontent had smouldered, but at\r\nleast great material progress had been made. Roads, railways, public\r\nbuildings had been created out of nothing, capital had been sunk, a new\r\nmachine of government had been constructed. Austria had come to stay, and\r\nAehrenthal, in annexing the provinces, felt himself to be merely setting\r\nthe seal to a document which had been signed a generation earlier. He\r\nhad failed to reckon with the outcry which this technical breach of\r\ninternational law evoked: like Bethmann-Hollweg, he had no blind faith in\r\n\"scraps of paper,\" and had no scruple in tearing up the Treaty of Berlin on\r\nwhich the whole Balkan settlement had rested. Nowhere was the outburst of\r\nfeeling so violent as in Serbia and Montenegro, who had never ceased to\r\ndream of the lost Serb provinces. For some months the two little States\r\nchallenged the accomplished fact, and seemed bent on staking their very\r\nexistence upon war with the great neighbouring Monarchy. Aehrenthal\r\nremained unmoved by their cries of impotent fury and settled down to a\r\ntrial of strength with his rival Izvolsky, the Russian Foreign Minister,\r\nwho encouraged the sister Slavonic States in their resistance. At length\r\nin March 1909 Germany stepped forward in \"shining armour\" to support her\r\nAustrian ally, and Russia, to avoid European war, gave way and abandoned\r\nthe Serbs to their fate. Nothing was left but a humiliating submission:\r\nthe Serbian Government was obliged to address a Note to the Great Powers,\r\ndeclaring that the annexation and internal condition of Bosnia did not in\r\nany way concern her.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This declaration was made the basis of the Austrian Note to\r\nSerbia in July 1914.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§5. _The Renaissance of Serbia._--From this diplomatic defeat dates the\r\nrenaissance of Serbia. It restored her to a sense of hard realities, and\r\ntaught her to substitute hard work for loud talk. So rough a challenge put\r\nthe national spirit on its mettle. The brief period between 1908 and 1912\r\nworked a real transformation in Belgrade, which could not fail to impress\r\nthose who took the trouble to look beneath the surface. Nowhere was the\r\nchange more marked than in the Serbian army, from which the regicide\r\nelements had been slowly but steadily eliminated. The two Balkan wars of\r\n1912-1913 revealed Serbia to the outside world as a military power, notable\r\nalike for the élan of its infantry, the high efficiency of its artillery,\r\nthe close camaraderie of officers and men. The first use made of her\r\nvictories over the Turks was the occupation of northern Albania, her only\r\npossible outlet to the sea so long as Dalmatia remains in Austrian hands.\r\nAustria-Hungary, who had only remained inactive because she had taken a\r\nTurkish victory for granted, now intervened, and by the creation of an\r\nartificial Albanian State vetoed Serbia's expansion to the Adriatic. The\r\nAustrian Foreign Minister, Count Berchtold, short-sighted and indolent then\r\nas now, failed to realise that the North Albanian harbours, for obvious\r\nreasons of physical geography, could never be converted into naval bases,\r\nsave at a prohibitive cost, and that their possession by Serbia, so far\r\nfrom being a menace to Austria, would involve the policing of a mountainous\r\ntract of country, inhabited by a turbulent and hostile population. It ought\r\nto have been obvious to him that the moment had arrived for tempting\r\nthe Serbs into the Austrian sphere of influence by the bait of generous\r\ncommercial concessions through Bosnia and Dalmatia. Several far-sighted\r\npoliticians in Austria urged this course upon him, and the Serbian Premier\r\nactually approached Vienna with far-reaching proposals in this very sense.\r\nTheir contemptuous rejection by Berchtold and the little clique of Foreign\r\nOffice officials who controlled his puppet figure, naturally strengthened\r\nstill further the bonds which united Belgrade and Petrograd. Serbia, shut\r\nout from the Adriatic, had no alternative save to seek her economic outlet\r\ndown the valley of the Vardar towards the Aegean, and in so doing she came\r\ninto violent conflict with Bulgarian aspirations in Macedonia. These facts\r\nalone would justify the assertion that the war between the Balkan allies\r\nwas directly due to Austro-Hungarian initiative; but it has also transpired\r\nthat the dissensions between Sofia and Belgrade were actively encouraged\r\nfrom Vienna, that Magyar influences were brought to bear upon King\r\nFerdinand, and that war material was sent down the Danube from Hungary to\r\nBulgaria. The outward and visible sign of these intrigues was a speech of\r\nthe Hungarian Premier, Count Tisza, opposing the Tsar's intervention in\r\nfavour of peace and virtually inciting Bulgaria to fight it out. The\r\nbreak-up of the Balkan League was the first condition to that Austrian\r\nadvance on Salonica which has always remained the ideal of the advocates\r\nof a forward policy in Vienna and Budapest, and which lies at the root of\r\nAustria-Hungary's action in provoking the present war.\r\n\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, however, are but one half of the problem. The issues\r\ninvolved are wider and deeper than the quarrels of Vienna and Budapest with\r\nBelgrade. Even if every man in Serbia were willingly prostrate before the\r\nHabsburg throne, there could be no real peace until the internal problem of\r\nAustria-Hungary's Southern Slav provinces is solved. What is at stake is\r\nthe future of eleven million people, inhabiting the whole tract of country\r\nfrom sixty miles north of Trieste to the centre of Macedonia, from the\r\nsouthern plains of Hungary to the North Albanian frontier. Of these,\r\nroughly four millions are in the two independent kingdoms; the remaining\r\nseven millions are divided between Austria (the provinces of Dalmatia,\r\nIstria, and Carniola) and Hungary (the autonomous kingdom of\r\nCroatia-Slavonia), while Bosnia-Herzegovina are governed jointly by Austria\r\nand Hungary. The history of these provinces during the past generation is\r\none of neglect and misgovernment. Croatia has been exploited economically\r\nby the Magyars, and the narrow interests of Budapest have prevented railway\r\ndevelopment and hampered local industries by skilful manipulation of\r\ntariffs and taxation. A further result is that even to-day Dalmatia (with\r\nthe exception of Ragusa) has no railway connections with the rest of\r\nEurope, and those of Bosnia are artificially directed towards Budapest\r\nrather than towards Agram, Vienna, and Western Europe. It is not too much\r\nto say that the situation of those provinces had become less favourable\r\n(if compared with surrounding standards) than it was at earlier periods of\r\ntheir history; for the old system of trade-routes had broken down there as\r\nelsewhere in Europe, but had not been replaced by modern communications.\r\n\r\n\r\n§6. _Serbo-Croat Unity._--Parallel with the new era instituted in Serbia\r\nsince 1903, a strong movement in favour of national unity took root among\r\nher kinsmen across the Austro-Hungarian frontier. The disruptive tendencies\r\nwhich had hitherto been so marked in Croatian politics began to weaken.\r\nThe so-called Serbo-Croat Coalition round which all the younger elements\r\nspeedily rallied, put forward an ambitious programme of constructive\r\ndemocratic reform as the basis of joint political action on the part of\r\nboth races, and held stubbornly together when the inevitable breach with\r\nthe Magyar oligarchy occurred. The Magyar Government felt that every effort\r\nmust be made to restore that discord between Croat and Serb which had been\r\nfor a generation one of the main pillars of their racial hegemony. These\r\ndesigns happened to coincide with the aims of the Foreign Office in Vienna\r\nin connection with the annexation of Bosnia, and Budapest and Vienna\r\ncombined in a systematic campaign of persecution against the Serbs of\r\nCroatia. \"Wholesale arrests and charges of treason led up to the monster\r\ntrial at Agram, which dragged on for seven months amid scandals worthy of\r\nthe days of Judge Jeffreys. The Diet ceased to meet, the constitution of\r\nCroatia was in abeyance, the elections were characterised by corruption and\r\nviolence such as eclipsed even the infamous Hungarian elections of 1910;\r\nthe Press and the political leaders were singled out for special acts of\r\npersecution and intimidation.\" These tactics were revealed to the outside\r\nworld in the notorious Friedjung Trial (December 1909), resulting out of\r\na libel action brought by the Serbo-Croat Coalition leaders against Dr.\r\nFriedjung, the distinguished Austrian historian. The documents, on the\r\nbasis of which he had publicly accused them of being paid agents of the\r\nSerbian Government, had been supplied to him by the Austro-Hungarian\r\nForeign Office, and the trial revealed them as impudent forgeries,\r\nconcocted in the Austro-Hungarian Legation in Belgrade! The moral\r\nresponsibility for these forgeries was subsequently brought home to Count\r\nForgách, the Minister in Belgrade, and indirectly, of course, to Count\r\nAehrenthal himself as Foreign Minister. But Forgách, though publicly\r\ndenounced as \"Count Azev,\"[1] was not allowed to fall into disgrace; on\r\nthe contrary, he had become within two years of his exposure permanent\r\nUnder-Secretary at the Ballplatz, and inspirer of new plots to discredit\r\nand ruin Serbia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: An allusion to the notorious Russian _agent provocateur _who\r\nwas at one and the same time a member of the secret police and of the\r\nrevolutionary organisation.]\r\n\r\nThe scandals of the Friedjung Trial led to the fall of the Governor of\r\nCroatia, but there was no change of system. After a temporary truce the old\r\nconflict revived, and within eighteen months the friction between Magyars\r\nand Croats was as acute as ever. The Magyar Government employed every\r\npossible device of administrative pressure in order to create dissensions\r\nbetween the Croat and Serb parties--repeated elections, wholesale\r\ncorruption and violence, persecution of the Press and of the political\r\nleaders. Yet so far from languishing under such a system, the movement for\r\nunity gained fresh strength and extended to the kindred Slovenes, striking\r\nroot even among the extreme Clericals, who had hitherto regarded the\r\nOrthodox Serbs with distrust and suspicion.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1912 the conflict culminated in the abolition of the\r\nCroatian constitution by the arbitrary decree of the Hungarian Premier, in\r\nthe appointment of a reactionary official as dictator, and a few months\r\nlater in the suspension of the charter of the Serb Orthodox Church.\r\n\r\n\r\n§7. _The Balkan Wars._--Never in history had a more inopportune moment\r\nbeen chosen for such crying illegalities. For close upon the heels of the\r\ndemonstrations and unrest which they evoked, came the dramatic events of\r\nthe Balkan War, the crushing victories of the allies, the resurrection of\r\nthe lost Serb Empire, the long-deferred revenge for the defeat of Kosovo.\r\nThe whole Southern Slav provinces of Austria-Hungary were carried off their\r\nfeet by a wave of enthusiasm for the allies, and an impossibly strained\r\nsituation was reached when the Government of Vienna placed itself in\r\nviolent conflict with Serbia, vetoed her expansion to the sea, insisted\r\nupon creating a phantom Albanian State, egged on Bulgaria against her\r\nallies, and finally mobilised in order to impose its will upon the Serbs.\r\nEvery peasant in the Slavonic South naturally contrasted Magyar misrule\r\nin Croatia with the splendid achievements of his Serb kinsmen across\r\nthe frontier. I know of poor villagers in the mountainous hinterland of\r\nDalmatia who, having no money to give to the cause of the Balkan Red Cross,\r\noffered casks of country wine or even such clothes and shoes as they could\r\nspare from their scanty belongings. The total subscriptions raised among\r\nthe Southern Slavs of the Monarchy in aid of the allies far exceeded any\r\nsums previously raised for charitable purposes among so poor a population.\r\n\"In the Balkan sun,\" said a prominent Croat Clerical, \"we see the dawn of\r\nour day.\"\r\n\r\nThe national rejoicings which \"the avenging of Kosovo\" evoked among the\r\nCroats, Serbs, and Slovenes of Austria-Hungary were accompanied by lively\r\nprotests against the bare idea of an Austro-Serbian war, which, so far as\r\nthe Southern Slavs on both sides of the frontier were concerned, would have\r\nbeen a civil war in the most literal sense of the word (and this civil\r\nwar, it must be remembered, is now actually being waged). The politicians,\r\nhowever, though well-nigh unanimous in their enthusiasm for the cause\r\nof the Balkan allies, could not at one breath throw off the habits of a\r\nlifetime. Petty jealousies still divided them and were skilfully played\r\nupon by the Magyar Government. The strain of five years of opposition and\r\npersecution had produced its effect upon the Coalition leaders and rendered\r\nthem all too prone to further concessions. But the younger generation had\r\nbeen profoundly affected by the Croatian dictatorship and the Balkan wars;\r\nat an age when our youth think of nothing but cricket and football, the\r\nstudents and even the schoolboys of Croatia, Dalmatia, and Bosnia became\r\nengrossed in political speculation, brooded over the wrongs of their\r\ndisunited race, and dreamt of Serbia as the new Piedmont of the Balkans. To\r\nall alike even the most advanced politician seemed no better than an old\r\nfogey, and it is no exaggeration to assert that the existing parties had\r\nlost all hold upon the overwhelming majority of those who in ten years'\r\ntime will represent the manhood and the intellect of the race. The\r\nwidespread nature of the movement may be illustrated by the school strike\r\nof the spring of 1912, during which every boy and girl above the age of\r\nfourteen in most of the primary and secondary schools of Croatia, Dalmatia,\r\nand Bosnia played truant as a protest against the misgovernment of Croatia.\r\nOn that occasion a crowd of 5000 school children paraded the streets of\r\nAgram shouting \"Down with Cuvaj\" (the Ban or Governor of Croatia), and\r\ncheering the police when they tried to intervene!\r\n\r\nAs in all such movements, the views of individuals varied in intensity:\r\nsome merely gave a theoretical adherence to the ideals of Mazzini or of\r\nMill, others swallowed the Nihilist doctrine of Bakunin and dreamt of\r\nrevolution, ushered in by terrorist propaganda. Out of this milieu came the\r\ntwo young assassins who murdered the Archduke Francis Ferdinand.\r\n\r\n\r\n§8. _The Murder of the Archduke_.--By a hideous irony of fate Francis\r\nFerdinand was the one man capable of restoring order to an already\r\ndesperate internal situation. His very person was a programme and a\r\nwatchword, and it had long been an open secret that his accession would be\r\nthe signal for drastic reforms. It was his ambition to supersede the effete\r\nDual system by a blend of centralism and federalism such as would reconcile\r\nthe national sentiment of individual races with the consciousness of a\r\ncommon citizenship and would at the same time restore to foreign policy the\r\npossibility of initiative. This programme involved the emancipation of the\r\nnon-Magyar races of Hungary from the intolerable racial tyranny of the\r\nMagyars, and at the same time a serious attempt to solve the Southern Slav\r\nquestion by unifying the race under Habsburg rule. As his Imperial uncle\r\ngrew older and feebler, Francis Ferdinand is known to have elaborated his\r\ndesigns, and a regular staff of able lieutenants had grouped themselves\r\nround him. But on the very eve of action the strong man was removed, to the\r\nscarcely veiled relief of all those elements in the State whose political\r\nand racial monopoly was threatened by such far-reaching and beneficial\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of the murder are still shrouded in mystery. It is known\r\nthat no proper measures were taken for the protection of the Archduke\r\nand his wife in Bosnia, though it is still impossible to assign the\r\nresponsibility for such criminal negligence. It is notorious that in a\r\ncountry like Bosnia, which has for years been infested with police spies\r\nand informers, and where every movement of every stranger is strictly under\r\ncontrol, so elaborate and ramified a plot could hardly hope to escape the\r\nnotice of the authorities. It has even been asserted that Princip and\r\nCabrinovic, the two assassins, were _agents provocateurs_ in the pay of\r\nthe police, and though no proof is as yet forthcoming, there is nothing\r\ninherently improbable in the idea.[1] Certain it is that the gravest\r\nsuspicion rests upon those who connived at the disgraceful anti-Serb riots\r\nof which Sarajevo was the scene for nearly forty-eight hours after the\r\nmurder.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The fact that they have only been sentenced to terms of\r\nimprisonment, while some of their accomplices have been condemned to death,\r\nhas a much simpler explanation. Both men are under the age of twenty, and\r\ntherefore by Austrian law immune from the death penalty.]\r\n\r\nThe murder provided an admirable pretext for aggression against Serbia, and\r\nat the same time tended to revive all the latent prejudice with which the\r\ncountry of the regicides was still regarded in the West. Yet those who seek\r\nto establish a connection between the crime of Sarajevo and the Serbian\r\nGovernment are on an utterly false scent. I have tried to describe\r\nthe atmosphere of universal and growing discontent which produced the\r\nexplosion. Those who know the Slavonic South are well aware that Bosnia,\r\nDalmatia, and Croatia are a seething pot which needs no stirring from the\r\noutside, and that the assassins are but the natural successors of the wild\r\nyoung students who during the last five years fired upon the Governors\r\nof Croatia and Bosnia.[1] But quite apart from this, the complicity of\r\nofficial Belgrade is rendered incredible by urgent considerations of\r\ninternal Serbian politics. After a long and delicate negotiation the\r\nConcordat with the Vatican had just been concluded: the Orient railway\r\nquestion had reached the critical stage: above all, a customs and military\r\nunion between Serbia and Montenegro was on the point of being concluded.\r\nBut, of course, quite apart from such considerations, Serbia was suffering\r\nfrom the extreme exhaustion consequent upon waging two wars within a year,\r\nand her statesmen, despite the rebuffs administered by Count Berchtold,\r\nwere genuinely anxious for a _modus vivendi_ with the neighbouring\r\nMonarchy, as an essential condition to a period of quiet internal\r\nconsolidation. But this was the very thing which the controllers of\r\nAustrian foreign policy--the phantom Minister Berchtold, the sinister\r\nclique in the Foreign Office, and the Magyar oligarchy, led by that\r\nmasterful reactionary, Count Tisza, the Hungarian Premier--were anxious to\r\navoid. They had never reconciled themselves to the new situation in the\r\nBalkans; and having twice backed the wrong horse (Turkey in the first\r\nwar, Bulgaria in the second) still continued to plot against the Bucarest\r\nsettlement of August 1913. Salonica still remained the secret Austrian\r\nobjective, and Serbia the main obstacle to the realisation of this dream.\r\nNot for the first time, the interests of Vienna and Constantinople\r\ncoincided, and the occult interests which link Budapest with Salonica\r\nplayed their part in the game.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: June 1910, June and November 1912, June 1913.]\r\n\r\nThe crime of Sarajevo removed the chief restraining force in the councils\r\nof the Monarchy and placed the fate of Europe at the mercy of a group of\r\ngamblers in Vienna, Budapest, and Berlin. The military party, under Konrad\r\nvon Hoetzendorf, chief of the Austrian General Staff (who a year ago was\r\nseriously speculating as to the collapse of Austria-Hungary), joined hands\r\nwith the Magyar extremists, whose political monopoly was threatened by the\r\nadvancing Slavonic tide, and with the inner ring of Prussian diplomacy,\r\nwhich believed the psychological moment to have arrived for measuring\r\nswords with Russia. The murder served as an admirable pretext to veil\r\ngrossly aggressive tactics. It was hoped that Russia might be manoeuvred\r\ninto a position where autocracy would rather abandon the Slav cause than\r\nseem to condone assassination; and it was confidently believed that Britain\r\nwould hold aloof from a quarrel whose origin was so questionable. Stripped\r\nof all outward seeming, the true issues of the conflict were very\r\ndifferent. Just as the policy of violent Turkification adopted by the Young\r\nTurks inevitably provoked the Balkan War, so the policy of Magyarisation,\r\nwhich has dominated Hungarian affairs for forty-five years and poisoned the\r\nrelations of Austria-Hungary with her southern neighbours, has led directly\r\nto the present conflagration.\r\n\r\n\r\n§9. _The Future of the Southern Slavs_.--There have always been two fatal\r\nobstacles to an Austrian solution of the Southern Slav problem,--Magyar\r\nhegemony and the Dual System, to which alone that hegemony owed its\r\nsurvival; and it is these two worn-out and reactionary ideas (if they can\r\nbe described as \"ideas\") that are at present fighting their death-struggle.\r\nIt was the ambition of Francis Ferdinand to achieve Serbo-Croat unity\r\nwithin the Monarchy, and thus simultaneously to counteract the attractions\r\nof Pan-Serb propaganda and to remove the most fertile source of friction\r\nbetween Austria-Hungary and Serbia. His death destroyed the last chance of\r\nsuch a solution; for the statesmen of Vienna and Budapest were not merely\r\nincapable but openly hostile. An appeal was to be made to the arbitrament\r\nof the sword.\r\n\r\nLong before war broke out it had become a commonplace of political theory\r\nthat the Southern Slav question could be solved in one of two ways--either\r\ninside the Habsburg Monarchy or outside it--either with its help and under\r\nits aegis, or against it and despite its resistance. With the outbreak of\r\nwar the problem assumed a new form; the alternatives are the absorption\r\nof the two independent Serb States in the neighbouring Monarchy--in other\r\nwords, the union of the entire Southern Slav race under Habsburg rule--or\r\nthe liberation of her kinsmen in the Monarchy by Serbia as the Southern\r\nSlav Piedmont. This latter ideal, it has always been obvious, could only be\r\nachieved through the medium of a general European war, and it is in this\r\nmanner that it is actually in process of achievement.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian Note to Serbia was deliberately framed in such a manner as to\r\nbe unacceptable by any State which valued its self-respect or prestige. The\r\nmilitary leaders desired war, while the Foreign Office, already committed\r\nfor years to a violently Serbophobe policy, was working hand in glove with\r\nthe German Ambassador Tschirschky, and with the very highest quarters in\r\nBerlin. The German Government in its official case admits having given\r\nAustria \"a free hand against Serbia,\" while there are good grounds for\r\nbelieving that the text of the Note was submitted to the German Emperor\r\nand that the latter fully approved of (if he did not actually suggest) the\r\nfatal time-limit of forty-eight hours, which rendered all efforts towards\r\npeace hopeless from the outset.\r\n\r\nThe Austrian case against Serbia, as embodied in this Note, rested upon a\r\nsecret investigation in the prison of Sarajevo. The persistent rumours that\r\nthe assassins are _agents-provocateurs_, and that pressure of a somewhat\r\ndrastic kind was brought to bear upon them after their arrest, cannot of\r\ncourse be accepted as proved. But the essential point to bear in mind\r\nis the fact that the details of the Austrian \"case,\" as embodied in the\r\nnotorious Note of July 23, originated in the same quarter as the previous\r\nattempts to slander and discredit Serbia. Count Forgách, the arch-forger\r\nof the Austrian Legation in Belgrade, was permanent Under-secretary in the\r\nForeign Office, and as Count Berchtold's right hand and prompter in Balkan\r\naffairs, was directly responsible for the pronounced anti-Serb tendencies\r\nwhich have dominated the foreign policy of the Dual Monarchy since the\r\nrise of the Balkan League. As a Magyar nobleman with intimate Jewish\r\nconnections, Forgách was an invaluable link between Magyar extremist policy\r\nand Berlin on the one hand and Salonica and Constantinople on the other.\r\nIn view of his record as the inspirer of the Vasic forgeries, we are amply\r\njustified in declining to accept any \"evidence\" prepared by him and his\r\nsubordinates, and insisting upon a full and open trial of the murderers as\r\nthe only conceivable foundation for charges of complicity.\r\n\r\nWhen all is said and done, however, the murder of the Archduke, though an\r\nevent of world-importance so far as the internal development and future\r\nof the Dual Monarchy is concerned, is none the less a side-issue in the\r\nSouthern Slav question. This seeming paradox will not surprise those who\r\nconsider the currents of national life among the Southern Slavs. The\r\ndiplomatic conflict between Belgrade and Vienna or Budapest is but\r\nthe outcome of a far deeper and wider movement. We are witnessing the\r\nbirth-throes of a new nation, the rise of a new national consciousness,\r\nthe triumph of the idea of National Unity among the three Southern Slav\r\nsisters--the Croats, Serbs, and Slovenes. Fate has assigned to Britain and\r\nto France an important share in the solution of the problem, and it is our\r\nduty to insist that this solution shall be radical and permanent, based\r\nupon the principle of Nationality and the wishes of the Southern Slav race.\r\nOnly by treating the problem as an organic whole, by avoiding patchwork\r\nremedies and by building for a distant future, can we hope to remove one of\r\nthe chief danger-centres in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately some of the indispensable books are in German or French, but\r\nthe following list offers a very considerable choice:--\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) AUSTRIA-HUNGARY\r\n\r\n_Austria-Hungary and Poland_, by H.W.

Salvation will come\r\nfrom the people, from their faith and their meekness. Fathers and teachers,\r\nwatch over the people's faith, and this will not be a dream. I have been\r\namazed all my life in our great people by their dignity, their true and\r\nseemly dignity. I have seen it myself, I can testify to it; I have seen\r\nit and marvelled at it; I have seen it in spite of the degraded sins and\r\npoverty-stricken appearance of our peasantry. They are not servile;\r\nand, even after two centuries of serfdom, they are free in manner and\r\nbearing,--yet without insolence, and not revengeful and not envious. 'You\r\nare rich and noble, you are clever and talented, well be so, God bless you.\r\nI respect you, but I know that I too am a man. By the very fact that I\r\nrespect you without envy I prove my dignity as a man....'\r\n\r\n\"God will save His people, for Russia is great in her humility. I dream of\r\nseeing, and seem to see clearly already, our future. It will come to pass\r\nthat even the most corrupt of our rich will end by being ashamed of his\r\nriches before the poor; and the poor, seeing his humility, will understand\r\nand give way before him, will respond joyfully and kindly to his honourable\r\nshame. Believe me that it will end in that; things are moving to that.\r\nEquality is to be found only in the spiritual dignity of man, and that\r\nwill only be understood among us. If we were brothers, there would be\r\nfraternity; but before that they will never agree about the division of\r\nwealth. We preserve the image of Christ, and it will shine forth like a\r\nprecious diamond to the whole world. So be it, so be it!\"--DOSTOIEFFSKY,\r\n_The Brothers Karamazov._\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The French are a decent civilised lot of people; but I wish we were not\r\nallies of Russia.\" This, or something very like it, is the spoken or\r\nunspoken thought of a very large number of persons, especially among the\r\nworking-classes in England at the present time. English suspicion of Russia\r\nis no new thing, though there is no doubt that the suppression of the\r\nrevolution during the years 1906-1909 made it more general than ever\r\nbefore. It was responsible, for example, for the Crimean War, and the\r\n\"crafty Russian\" has become a catch-word almost as widely accepted in\r\nEngland as the phrase \"perfidious Albion\" is upon the Continent. I have\r\nseen Russia at her worst: I saw the revolution stamped out cruelly and\r\nrelentlessly; I have lived three years in Finland, and know the weariness\r\nof spirit and aching bitterness of heart that comes to a fine and cultured\r\nrace in its perpetual struggle for liberty against an alien Government to\r\nwhom the word liberty means nothing but rebellion. And yet I am firmly\r\npersuaded of the innate soundness of the Russian people, and of the\r\ntremendous future which lies before it in the history of the world. I\r\nbelieve too that the English are suspicious of Russia, not because Russia\r\nis crafty or evil or barbaric, but because English people find it very\r\ndifficult to understand a race which is so extraordinarily different from\r\nthemselves. We fear the unknown; we suspect what is unlike ourselves; yet\r\nwe shall do well, in the present crisis, whether we are thinking of our\r\nenemy Germany or our ally Russia, to remember the axiom laid down by Edmund\r\nBurke, the greatest of English political thinkers: \"It is impossible to\r\nbring an indictment against a whole nation.\"\r\n\r\nIn any case, for good or ill, Russia is our ally, and if Germany is beaten,\r\nRussia seems likely to play as great a part in the settlement as she did in\r\n1815. It therefore behoves us, in our own self-interest if for no higher\r\nmotive, to try and understand the spirit and ideals of a great people, who,\r\nas they did a century ago at the time of Napoleon, are once again coming\r\nforward to assist Europe in ridding herself of a military despotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. _The Russian State._--Many of us do not realise the most obvious facts\r\nabout Russia. For example, our atlases, which give us Europe on one page\r\nand Asia on another, prevent us from grasping the most elementary fact of\r\nall--her vastness. Mr. Kipling has told us that \"East is East and West\r\nis West, and never the twain shall meet.\" But Russia confounds both Mr.\r\nKipling and the map-makers by stretching from the Baltic to the Pacific.\r\nFor her there is not Europe and Asia but one continent, and she is the\r\nwhole _inside_ of it. All Europe between the four inland seas, and all Asia\r\nnorth of lat. 50° (and a good deal south of it too)--that is Russia, a\r\ntotal area of 8-1/4 million square miles! This enormous country, which\r\ncomprises one-sixth of the land-surface of the globe, is at present thinly\r\npopulated; it has roughly 20 persons to the square mile as against 618 to\r\nthe square mile in England and Wales. Yet for all that it contains the\r\nlargest white population of any single state on earth, numbering in all\r\n171 million souls. Moreover, this population is increasing rapidly; it\r\nhas quadrupled itself during the last century, and with the advent of\r\nindustrialism the increase is likely to be still more rapid. Many among us\r\nalive to-day may see Russia's population reach and perhaps pass that of\r\nteeming China. As yet, however, industrialism is only at its beginning in\r\nRussia; more than 85 per cent of the inhabitants live in the country, as\r\ntillers of the soil.\r\n\r\nIt will be at once evident that this fact gives her an immense advantage\r\nover industrial nations in time of war. She has, on the one hand, an almost\r\ninexhaustible supply of men to draw upon, while, on the other hand, her\r\nsimple economic structure is hardly at all affected. A great European war\r\nmay mean for a Western country dislocation of trade, hundreds of mills and\r\npits standing idle, vast masses of unemployed, leading to distress, poverty\r\nand in the end starvation; for Russia it means little more than that the\r\npeasants grow fat on the corn and food-stuffs which in normal times they\r\nwould have exported to the West. Furthermore, her geographical and economic\r\ncircumstances render Russia ultimately invincible from the military point\r\nof view, as Napoleon found to his cost in 1812. She has no vital parts,\r\nsuch as France has in Paris or Germany has in Silesia or Westphalia, upon\r\nwhich the life of the whole State organism depends; she is like some vast\r\nmulti-cellular invertebrate animal which it is possible to wound but not\r\nto destroy. Russia has much to gain from a great European war and hardly\r\nanything to lose.\r\n\r\nAt first sight, therefore, there seems to be a great deal in favour of\r\nthe theory, somewhat widely held at the moment, that to crush Germany and\r\nAustria will be to lay Europe at the feet of Russia, and that when Germany\r\nhas been driven out of France and Belgium, the Allies in the West might\r\nhave to patch up a peace with her in order to drive the Russians out\r\nof Germany. Behind this theory lies the assumption that Russia is an\r\naggressive military state, inspired by the same ideals as have led Germany\r\nto deluge the world with blood. This is an assumption which is, I believe,\r\nabsolutely unwarranted by anything in the history or character of the\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nHistorically speaking, the Russian Empire is an extension of the old Roman\r\nEmpire; it is the direct heir of the Eastern Roman Empire, which had its\r\ncapital at Constantinople, as the mediaeval \"Holy Roman Empire,\" founded by\r\nCharlemagne in A.D. 800, was the heir of the Western Roman Empire, which\r\nhad its capital at Rome itself. But the Eastern Empire survived its Western\r\ntwin by a thousand years; the Goths deposed the last Roman emperor in 476,\r\nthe Turks took Constantinople in 1453. The Russian Empire, therefore,\r\nwhich did not begin its political development until after the fall of\r\nConstantinople, entered the field some six and a half centuries later than\r\nthe mediaeval empire of Charlemagne, which was indeed already falling\r\nto pieces in the end of the fifteenth century. Thus Russia presents the\r\nstrange spectacle of a mediaeval State existing in the twentieth century,\r\nand she is still in some particulars what Western Europe was in the Middle\r\nAges. She has, however, attained a unity, a strength and a centralisation\r\nwhich the Holy Roman Empire never succeeded in acquiring. There is nothing\r\ncorresponding to the feudal system, with all the disruptive tendencies\r\nwhich that system carried with it, in modern Russia; partly owing to the\r\nconstant danger of Mongolian invasion which threatened Russia for so many\r\ncenturies, partly as a result of Ivan the Terrible's destruction of the\r\n_boyars_, who were analogous to the mediaeval barons, and of Peter the\r\nGreat's substitution of a nobility of service for that of rank, Russia\r\nis politically more centralised than any mediaeval, and socially more\r\ndemocratic than any modern, country. Russia has also solved that other\r\ngreat problem which perpetually agitated the mediaeval world--the conflict\r\nbetween the secular and the spiritual power. She is the most religious\r\nnation in the world, but she has no Papacy; Peter the Great subordinated\r\nthe Church to the State by placing the Holy Synod, which controls the\r\nformer, under the authority of a layman, a minister appointed by the Tsar.\r\nYet, while she appears united and centralised when we think of her nebulous\r\nprototype, the Holy Roman Empire, we have only to compare her with her\r\nWestern neighbours, and especially with that triumph of State-organisation,\r\nGermany, to see how amorphous, how inefficient, how loose, how mediaeval is\r\nthe structure of this enormous State.\r\n\r\nPeter the Great, who was more than any other man the creator of modern\r\nRussia, saw clearly that the only way of holding this inchoate State-mass\r\ntogether was to call into existence a huge administrative machine, and he\r\nsaw equally clearly that, if such a machine was not itself to become a\r\ndisruptive force through the personal ambition and self-aggrandisement\r\nof its members, it must be framed on democratic and not aristocratic\r\nprinciples. As Mr. Maurice Baring puts it, \"Peter the Great introduced\r\nthe democratic idea that service was everything, rank nothing. He had it\r\nproclaimed to the whole gentry that any gentleman, in any circumstances\r\nwhatsoever and to whatever family he belonged, should salute and yield\r\nplace to any officer. The gentleman served as a private soldier and became\r\nan officer, but a private soldier who did not belong to the nobility, and\r\nwho attained the rank of a commissioned officer, became, _ipso facto_, a\r\nmember of the hereditary nobility.... In the civil service he introduced\r\nthe same democratic system. He divided it into three sections: military,\r\ncivil, and court. Every section was divided into fourteen ranks, or\r\n_Chins_; the attainment of the eighth class conferred the privilege of\r\nhereditary nobility, even though those who received it might have been\r\nof the humblest origin. He hereby replaced the aristocratic hierarchy of\r\npedigree by a democratic hierachy of service. Promotion was made solely\r\naccording to service; lineage counted for nothing. There was no social\r\ndifference, however wide, which could not be levelled by means of State\r\nservice.\" This is partly what was meant when it was stated in the last\r\nparagraph that Russia was socially the most democratic of modern countries.\r\nThe system established by Peter the Great exists to-day. Russia is\r\ngoverned, not by a feudal nobility like that which ground the faces of\r\nthe poor in France before the revolution of 1789, nor by a number of\r\ncapitalists who live by exploiting the workers; for neither feudal nobility\r\nnor capitalism (as yet) has any real power in Russia. She is governed by a\r\ncivil service, and by a civil service more democratic than our own, where\r\nthe higher posts are as a rule only open to members of the upper and middle\r\nclasses, less exclusive than that of India, where the higher officials are\r\nnearly all recruited from the members of an alien race--a civil service,\r\nin short, whose only close parallel is the hierarchy of the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch. Imagine the Roman Church as a secular institution, with a monarch\r\nat its head ruling by hereditary right instead of an elected president like\r\nthe Pope, and you get a very fair idea of the Russian Government machine.\r\nAll that we associate with the word aristocracy in the West, the hereditary\r\nprinciple, primo-geniture, the accumulation of the land and capital of the\r\ncountry in the hands of a small class, the spirit of caste, the traditions\r\nof nobility handed down with the title-deeds from father to son, are either\r\nnon-existent or of comparative unimportance in Russian society.\r\n\r\nThere is also none of the keen sensitiveness to minute social distinctions\r\nand to the social proprieties which mark them that is so striking a feature\r\nof the life in \"democratic\" England and to which we have given the name\r\n\"snobbery.\" There are of course social strata in Russia, but they are\r\nbroadly marked and there is no sense of competition between them. A peasant\r\nis not ashamed of being a peasant, and when he meets a nobleman he meets\r\nhim on terms of spiritual equality while acknowledging his superior\r\nposition in the social scale. A twin-brother of English \"snobbery\" is\r\nEnglish \"hypocrisy.\" This, as has been well said, is a kind of \"social\r\ncement,\" for it is a tribute to a standard of social conduct set up by the\r\ndominant class in a nation. And since there exists no dominant class in\r\nRussia, but only a dominant hierarchy drawn from all classes, hypocrisy is\r\nabsent from the Russian character. Mr. Stephen Graham, who was, I believe,\r\nat one time a clerk in a London office, found our civilisation so\r\nintolerable that one day he flung it off and escaped to Russia, where he\r\nhas lived as a peasant tramp for many years. To revolutionaries who met him\r\nand expressed their astonishment that an Englishman should choose Russia of\r\nall places to live in, he replied, \"I came to Russia because it is the only\r\nfree country left in the world.\" There is, in truth, much to be said for\r\nthis startling remark. In no country on earth is there such unaffected\r\ngood-will, such open hospitality, such an instinctive respect for personal\r\nliberty--liberty of thought and of manners--such tolerance for the\r\nfrailties of human nature, such an abundance of what the great Russian\r\nnovelist Dostoieffsky called \"all-humanness\" and St. Paul called \"charity,\"\r\nas in Russia. All this, of course, did not come about as a result of\r\nthe bureaucratic system; it springs like that system itself from the\r\nfundamentally democratic spirit of the Russian people.\r\n\r\n\r\n§2. _Religion_.--The last paragraph will read strangely to those people\r\nwhose only ideas about Russia are gleaned from newspaper accounts of\r\nthe revolution of 1905. We shall come back to the revolution and its\r\nsignificance later; but meanwhile we must notice another very striking fact\r\nabout Russian life--its all-pervading religious atmosphere. Russia is a\r\nland of peasants. In England and Wales 78 per cent of the population live\r\nin towns and the remaining 22 per cent in the country; in Russia something\r\nlike 87 per cent live in the country as against 13 per cent in the towns.\r\nThese figures are enough to show where the real centre of gravity of the\r\nRussian nation lies. The peasant, or _moujik_, is a primitive and generally\r\nan entirely illiterate person, but he possesses qualities which his more\r\nsophisticated brothers in the West may well envy and admire, a profound\r\ncommon-sense, a grand simplicity of life and outlook, and an unshakable\r\nfaith in the unseen world.\r\n\r\nThe interior of Russia is almost wholly unknown in the West; until a few\r\nyears back it was as much of a _terra incognita_ as Central Africa. But the\r\nrevolution led English writers and journalists to explore it, and when the\r\ndust and smoke of that upheaval, which had obscured the truth from the eyes\r\nof Europe, passed away, an astonished world perceived the real Russia for\r\nthe first time. \"Russia,\" writes Mr. Stephen Graham, who has done more\r\nthan any other man to bring the truth home to us, \"is not a land of\r\nbomb-throwers, is not a land of intolerable tyranny and unhappiness, of\r\na languishing and decayed peasantry, of a corrupt and ugly church; the\r\nRussians are an agricultural nation, bred to the soil, illiterate as the\r\nsavages, and having as yet no ambition to live in the towns; they are as\r\nstrong as giants, simple as children, mystically superstitious by reason\r\nof their unexplained mystery.\" Russia is in fact 145 million\r\npeasants--ploughing and praying. And here once again one is reminded of the\r\nMiddle Ages. Cross the Russian frontier and you enter the mediaeval world.\r\nMiracles are believed in, holy men are revered as saints, thousands of\r\npilgrims journey on foot every year to Jerusalem, which is to every true\r\nbeliever the centre of the universe and therefore becomes at Easter almost\r\na Russian city. Russia is the most Christian country in the world, and her\r\npeople are the most Christ-like. The turbulence and violence, so contrary\r\nto the Christian spirit, which was an inseparable feature of mediaeval\r\nfeudalism is absent from Russia; and the gospel of non-resistance, of\r\nbrotherly love, of patience under affliction, of pity and mercy, which\r\nTolstoi preached so eloquently to the world at large, he learnt from\r\ntwo teachers--the peasant of modern Russia and the Peasant of ancient\r\nPalestine, who was crucified upon the Cross.\r\n\r\nYet it is a mistake to talk, as some do, of the power of the Russian\r\nChurch, or of \"priestcraft.\" The Church has little political power or\r\nsocial prestige. It is the power of religion, not that of ecclesiastical\r\ninstitutions, which is the arresting fact about modern Russia. It is not\r\nso much that Russia has a church, as that she _is_ a church. In England\r\nwe have narrowed religion down to one day of the week and shut it up in\r\nspecial buildings which we call churches; in Russia it is impossible to\r\navoid religion. As you pass out of the gangway of the ticket-office at the\r\nrailway station, you find yourself in front of a sacred picture with a\r\nlamp burning continually before it, and you are expected to utter a prayer\r\nbefore beginning your journey. Every room in Russia has its _eikon_--is in\r\nfact a chapel, every enterprise is sanctified by prayer and ceremony. All\r\nEnglish travellers in Russia have acknowledged this profound national sense\r\nof religion, and contrasted it with the religious formalism of the West.\r\n\"Italy,\" wrote Mr. H.G. Wells, on his recent visit to Russia, \"abounds\r\nin noble churches because the Italians are artists and architects, and a\r\nchurch is an essential part of the old English social system, but Moscow\r\nglitters with two thousand crosses because the people are organically\r\nChristian. I feel in Russia that for the first time in my life I am in a\r\ncountry where Christianity is alive. The people I saw crossing themselves\r\nwhenever they passed a church, the bearded men who kissed the relics in the\r\nChurch of the Assumption, the unkempt grave-eyed pilgrim, with his ragged\r\nbundle on his back and his little tea-kettle slung in front of him, who was\r\nstanding quite still beside a pillar in the same church, have no parallels\r\nin England.\" Mr. Rothay Reynolds, in his interesting and sympathetic book\r\n_My Russian Year_, writes in much the same strain: \"In Russia God and His\r\nMother, saints and angels, seem near; men rejoice or stand ashamed beneath\r\ntheir gaze. The people of the land have made it a vast sanctuary, perfumed\r\nwith prayer and filled with the memories of heroes of the faith. Saints and\r\nsinners, believers and infidels, are affected by its atmosphere; and so it\r\nhas come about that Russia is the land of lofty ideals.\" And Mr. Stephen\r\nGraham, again, in his _Undiscovered Russia_, speaks with glowing admiration\r\nof the Russian Church. \"The Holy Church,\" he says, \"is wonderful. It is the\r\nonly fervid living church in Europe. It lives by virtue of the people\r\nwho compose it. If the priests were wood, it would still be great. The\r\nworshippers are always there with one accord. There are always strangers in\r\nthe churches, always pilgrims. God is the Word that writes all men brothers\r\nin Russia and all women sisters. The fact behind that word is the fountain\r\nof hospitality and friendship.\"\r\n\r\nThe religious aspect of Russian life has been dwelt upon at some length,\r\nbecause it is the key to everything in Russia and has a direct bearing upon\r\nthe present war. \"Religion in Russia,\" writes Mr. Maurice Baring, \"is a\r\npart of patriotism. The Russian considers that a man who is not Orthodox\r\nis not a Russian. He divides humanity, roughly, into two categories--the\r\nOrthodox and the heathen--just as the Greeks divided humanity into Greeks\r\nand Barbarians. Not only is the Church of Russia a national church, owing\r\nto the large part which the State, the Emperor, and the civil authority\r\nplay in it, but in Russia religion itself becomes a question of\r\nnationality, nationalism, and patriotism.\" Russian Christianity, like\r\nRussian Tsardom, is derived from the old Roman empire of Constantinople.\r\nThe Russian Church is a branch, and far the most important branch, of the\r\nGreek Orthodox Church, which drifted apart from the Catholic Church, which\r\nhad its centre at Rome, and finally separated from it in the eleventh\r\ncentury. As the greatest Orthodox Christian power in the world, Russia\r\nnaturally regards herself as the rightful protector of all Orthodox\r\nChristians. Her mortal enemy, with whom so long as he remains in Europe any\r\nlasting peace is impossible, is the Turk; and her eyes are ever directed\r\ntowards Constantinople, as the ancient capital of her faith. The spirit of\r\nthe Crusades is far from dead in the Russian people; the Crimean War, for\r\nexample, was fought in that spirit.\r\n\r\nIt will be at once apparent that Russia takes and must continue to take\r\na profound interest in the Christian peoples of the Balkans. Greeks,\r\nRoumanians, Servians, Bulgarians and Montenegrins all belong to the\r\nOrthodox Church; all have been engaged throughout the nineteenth century\r\nin a struggle for existence against the common foe, Islam. Moreover, all\r\nexcept the two first-mentioned peoples are allied to Russia by ties of race\r\nas well as by religion, since they are members of the Slavonic stock. To\r\nthe average Russian, therefore, the bulk of the Balkan peninsula is as\r\nmuch Russia Irredenta, as the north-east coast of the Adriatic is Italia\r\nIrredenta to the average Italian; and as a matter of fact there is a good\r\ndeal more to be said for Russia's case than for Italy's. There is, however,\r\nanother great power which possesses interests in the Balkans and which\r\nis viewed by Russia with a suspicion and dislike hardly inferior to that\r\nentertained towards Turkey--I mean the empire of Austria-Hungary. A\r\nCatholic state, controlled by Germans and Magyars, Austria-Hungary contains\r\nin its southern portion a population of over seven million Slavs, some\r\nthree millions of whom are of the Orthodox faith. The Dual Monarchy has\r\nconstantly outraged national and religious feeling in Russia by her\r\ntreatment of this Slavonic population, and her annexation in 1908 of Bosnia\r\nand Herzegovina, both of them Slavonic countries, was regarded as an open\r\nchallenge to Russia.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore surprising that the Tsar has intervened in the present\r\ncrisis. Had it refused to come to the assistance of Servia when Austria\r\nattacked her, the Russian Government would have been unable to face public\r\nopinion. Even those who know Russia best are amazed at the complete\r\nunanimity of the country in the matter of this war; and proof that it is\r\nnot merely a war of aggression inspired by Pan-Slavist sentiment may\r\nbe found in the fact that all political parties, revolutionaries,\r\nconstitutionalists and reactionaries, have enthusiastically approved it.\r\nHow far Germany misunderstood (or affected to misunderstand) the real state\r\nof feeling in Russia may be seen in the despatch of July 26 by the British\r\nAmbassador in Vienna, who, in talking the crisis over with the German\r\nAmbassador and asking \"whether the Russian Government might not be\r\ncompelled by public opinion to intervene on behalf of a kindred\r\nnationality,\" was told that \"everything depended on the personality of the\r\nRussian Minister for Foreign Affairs, who could resist easily, if he\r\nchose, _the pressure of a few newspapers._\" England drew her sword in this\r\nstruggle on behalf of Belgium and in the name of civilisation and treaty\r\nrights; Russia has done the same on behalf of Serbia and in the name of\r\ncommon blood and a common altar. I, for one, firmly believe that her hands\r\nare as clean as ours.\r\n\r\n\r\n§3. _The Revolutionary Movement and its Significance._--It is now time to\r\nsay something of the revolutionary movement of 1905 and of its ruthless\r\nsuppression which gave Russia so evil a reputation in the eyes of Western\r\nEurope. It was my good fortune to be a resident in the dominions of the\r\nTsar during the critical years of 1906-9, to be present at a session of the\r\nfirst Duma and to mingle with the members of that historic assembly in the\r\nlobby of the Parliament House, to catch something of the extraordinary\r\nbelief in the coming of the millennium which was prevalent among all\r\nclasses in Petrograd in the first charmed months of 1906, and finally\r\nto have been acquainted with active revolutionaries and their friends\r\nthroughout the whole of my period of residence. I can therefore speak with\r\na certain amount of inner knowledge of the revolution; and though I do not\r\nwish to claim any particular authority for the opinions stated below, which\r\nare after all nothing but the opinions of a single individual who has lived\r\nfor three years in a corner of the Russian Empire, yet they have at least\r\nthis advantage over those entertained on the subject by the average\r\nEnglishmen, viz. that they are based not on newspaper reports but on\r\nactual experience, and that they were arrived at gradually and--it may be\r\nadded--with considerable reluctance, since they had, as it were, to win\r\ntheir way through a number of my own personal sympathies and political\r\nprejudices. There is, of course, no room here for any detailed treatment of\r\na movement upon which a big book might be written, and I shall therefore\r\nhave to limit myself to a few rather bald generalisations which I must\r\nask the reader to accept not as the truth, but as what one man of limited\r\nexperience and vision conceives to be the truth about the Russian\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nThe main reason why English people get mistaken ideas about Russia is that\r\nthey imagine Russians to be nothing but Englishmen picturesquely disguised\r\nin furs and top-boots, and because they interpret the political situation\r\nin Russia in terms of English history and politics. As I have already tried\r\nto show, Russians are built differently from English people, _from the soul\r\noutwards_, while the political and social condition of the Russian Empire\r\nis totally unlike anything that has ever existed in this country. If\r\ntherefore the real causes of the movement of 1905 and of its failure are to\r\nbe rightly understood, we must put away from our minds the desire to find\r\nanalogies in the English revolutions of 1642 and 1688, or the French\r\nRevolution of 1789, or the social revolution of which Karl Marx dreamed;\r\nRussia can only be interpreted in terms of Russian history and Russian\r\nconditions. In one thing, however, the Russian revolution was like all\r\nrevolutions which have ever been or are ever likely to be, viz. that it was\r\nconcerned with two distinct issues, one a narrow question of political and\r\nconstitutional reform, and the other a far wider question involving an\r\nattempt to reconstruct not merely the institutions of society but also to\r\ntransform the ideals and conceptions upon which society rested.\r\n\r\nLet us first of all consider the narrower political issue. This was simple\r\nenough; the outbreak of 1905 had as its primary object the setting up of\r\nsome form of representative government which would control the bureaucratic\r\nmachine. It has been already pointed out that the constitution of modern\r\nRussia was largely due to the genius of Peter the Great. During the\r\nnineteenth century, however, it became apparent to thinking Russians that\r\nthe constitution, for the sake both of stability and efficiency, needed\r\ndevelopment in the direction of popular representation. The plea of\r\nefficiency was really far the stronger of the two. Had Peter the Great been\r\neternal, he might possibly have continued to exercise an effective control\r\nover the administrative system which he created; for he was a man of\r\nsuperhuman energy and will-power. But most Tsars, who are men of ordinary\r\ncapacity, found it impossible to do so. The consequence was that\r\nthe bureaucracy acquired what amounted in practice to absolute\r\nirresponsibility. Now irresponsibility is demoralising to any\r\nadministration, however democratic be the principles upon which its\r\nofficials are selected. A bureaucracy, ruling without proper external\r\ncontrol, becomes a prey to the demons of red tape, routine, officialdom and\r\nplace-hunting; it tends to stifle individual initiative and the sense\r\nof moral responsibility, since it forgets the real object of its\r\nexistence--the good government of the country--in its passion for\r\nself-preservation and its desire to secure the smooth-working of the\r\nmachine; it becomes inhuman, intensely conservative and corrupt. Above all\r\nit develops a hyper-sensitiveness to lay criticism, which compels it to do\r\nall in its power--and in Russia that power is unlimited--to crush freedom\r\nof speech and freedom of the press. The problem, however, of devising some\r\npopular check upon its action was an extremely difficult one for the simple\r\nreason that the mass of the Russian people never have taken, and even\r\nto-day do not take, any interest in political questions. Nevertheless the\r\nTsar, Alexander II., who was one of the most enlightened monarchs that\r\never sat upon the Russian throne, determined to attempt a solution.\r\nUnfortunately on March 1, 1881, the very day when Alexander had given his\r\napproval to a scheme of constitutional reform, involving the establishment\r\nof representative institutions, he was assassinated by revolutionaries.\r\nThis fatal act put back the clock for twenty-five years, the court and the\r\nnation were thrown into the arms of the bureaucracy as their only protector\r\nagainst terrorism, and reaction reigned supreme. Meanwhile the bureaucracy\r\ngrew more corrupt, more tyrannical, more inefficient every day, while on\r\nthe other hand the party of reform, thrust as it were underground and\r\nhunted like rats, became more and more bitter in spirit and more and more\r\nextreme in theory.\r\n\r\nIt is important to bear in mind that the struggle has never from beginning\r\nto end been one which divided the nation as a whole into two hostile camps.\r\nPublic opinion, when it has not been indifferent, has swayed now to one\r\nside and now to the other, according as it was stirred by some flagrant\r\nact of oppression on the part of the bureaucracy or some outrageous act of\r\nterrorism on the part of the revolutionaries. The truth is that the civil\r\nwar in Russia--for it was nothing less--was confined to quite a narrow\r\nsection of society. It has been said that there are practically speaking no\r\nclass distinctions in the English sense of the word, in Russia; there is,\r\nhowever, a very real distinction between the _intelligentsia_ and the\r\npeasants. The _intelligentsia_ are the few million educated Russians who\r\ncontrol, or seek to control, the destinies of the 145 million uneducated\r\ntillers of the soil. There is nothing quite like them in this country,\r\nthough the expression \"the professional class\" describes them in part.\r\nBroadly speaking, they are people who have passed through school and\r\nuniversity, and can therefore lay claim to a certain amount of culture;\r\ntheir birth is a matter of no moment, they may be the children of peasants\r\nor of noblemen. It is from this \"class,\" if we can call it so, that both\r\nthe bureaucracy and the revolutionary movement draw their recruits. The\r\nreal tragedy of Russia is that neither the party of reform nor the party of\r\nreaction shares, or even understands, the outlook and ideals of the people.\r\nRussian culture is still so comparatively recent that it has not yet passed\r\nout of the imitative stage; and, in spite of the work of Pushkin, Gogol,\r\nand Dostoieffsky, the books that are read and studied in Russia are for\r\nthe most part translations from foreign authors. The result is that the\r\npolitical and social ideas of the _intelligentsia_ are almost wholly\r\nderived from countries whose structure is totally different from their\r\nown. We shall presently see that this fact had an important bearing on the\r\ndevelopment of the outbreak of 1905. It is sufficient here to notice\r\nthat the struggle was one between two sections of the _intelligentsia_,\r\npolitical idealism against political stagnation, the Red Flag _versus_ Red\r\nTape.\r\n\r\nAfter twenty years of bureaucratic government the country as a whole began\r\nto grow once again restless. In this period a proletariate had come into\r\nbeing. It was a mere drop in the bucket of 145 millions of peasants,\r\nbut its voice was heard in the towns, and it was steeped in the Marxian\r\ndoctrines of Social Democracy. Moreover the peasants themselves had their\r\ngrievances. They cared nothing and understood less of the political\r\ntheories which the revolutionaries assiduously preached among them, but\r\nthey pricked up their ears when the agitators began to talk about land and\r\ntaxation. Up to 1861 the peasants had been serfs, the property, with the\r\nland on which they lived, of the landowner. At their emancipation it was\r\nnecessary to provide them with land of their own; the State, therefore,\r\nbought what was considered sufficient for the purpose from the landowners,\r\nhanded it over to the peasants, and recouped itself by imposing a land-tax\r\non the peasants to expire after a period of forty-nine years. This tax was\r\nfelt to be exceedingly onerous, and in addition to this by the beginning of\r\nthe twentieth century it became clear that the land acquired in 1861 was\r\nnot nearly enough to support a growing population. These factors, together\r\nwith the disastrous Russo-Japanese war, which revealed an appalling state\r\nof corruption and incompetency in the government of the country, furnished\r\nthe revolutionaries with an opportunity which was not to be missed. A rapid\r\nseries of military and naval mutinies, agrarian disorders, assassinations\r\nof obnoxious officials, socialist risings in the towns, during the\r\nyear 1905, culminating in the universal strike of October, brought the\r\nGovernment to its knees, and on the 17th of the same month the Tsar issued\r\nhis manifesto granting freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and a\r\nrepresentative assembly. The revolution had, apparently, won on the\r\nconstitutional issue.\r\n\r\nYet what looked like the end of bureaucratic absolutism proved to be\r\nthe destruction of the revolutionary party. Had the reformers of 1905\r\nconcentrated their energies upon the task of turning the new legislature\r\ninto an adequate check upon the bureaucratic system, there is little doubt\r\nthey would have succeeded. As it was their success in this direction was\r\nonly partial. It is true that a Duma still sits at the Taurida Palace\r\nat Petrograd, but it is elected on a narrow property franchise, and\r\nits relations with the bureaucracy are as yet not properly defined; it\r\ncriticises but it possesses no real control. This failure of the revolution\r\nwas almost wholly due to the revolutionaries themselves, who, instead of\r\nconfining their attacks to the Government machine, sought to undermine the\r\nentire structure of society and to overthrow the moral and religious ideals\r\nof the nation. Moreover, their attitude was entirely negative, and they\r\npossessed little or no constructive ability of any kind. Even the first\r\nDuma, which contained the ablest politicians among the reformers, did\r\nnot succeed in passing acts of parliament, affirming the most elementary\r\nprinciples of civil liberty; and it damaged itself irreparably in the\r\neyes of the country by refusing to condemn \"terrorism\" while demanding an\r\namnesty for all political offenders. The unique opportunity which the first\r\nDuma afforded was frittered away in futile bickerings and wordy attacks\r\nupon the Government.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, though a temporary truce was observed during the Duma's\r\nsessions, its dissolution on July 21, 1906, two and a half months after\r\nopening, was the signal for a fresh outburst of outrages on both sides. The\r\ncountry was fast drifting into anarchy; agrarian risings, indiscriminate\r\nbomb-throwing, _pogroms_, highway robberies carried out in the name of the\r\n\"social revolution\" and euphemistically entitled expropriation, outbreaks\r\nof a horrible kind of blood-lust which delighted in motiveless murder for\r\nthe sake of murder, were the order of the day. The revolution was\r\nstrong enough neither to crush the reactionaries nor to control the\r\nrevolutionaries themselves. The foundations of the social structure seemed\r\nto be dissolving in a welter of blood and crime, and public opinion, which\r\nin its hatred of bureaucracy had hitherto sided with the revolution,\r\nsuddenly drew back in horror from the abyss which opened out in front of\r\nit. Stolypin, the Strafford of modern Russia, who condemned the extremists\r\nof both sides, was called to the helm of the State; his watchword, \"Order\r\nfirst, reform afterwards,\" was backed by the force of public opinion; and,\r\nas he stamped out the revolution with a heel of iron, the country shuddered\r\nbut approved. The peasants were pacified by the remission of the hated tax,\r\nand by measures for providing them with more land; and Russia sank once\r\nmore into her normal condition.\r\n\r\nBut political incompetency is not a reason sufficiently weighty in itself\r\nto account for the remarkable revulsion of public feeling against the\r\nrevolutionary party. Behind the narrow political issue lay the larger\r\nphilosophical and moral one; and it was the discovery by the country of the\r\nreal character and ultimate aims of the party which for a few months\r\nin 1906 seized the reins of power that will alone provide a sufficient\r\nexplanation of one of the most astonishing political debacles of modern\r\nhistory. The revolution was nothing less than an attempt by a small\r\nminority of theorists and moral anarchists to force Western civilisation\r\nupon Russia, and not Western civilisation as it actually is but a sort of\r\nabstract \"Westernism\" derived from books. For the revolutionaries were far\r\nmore Western than the Westerns. They had not merely swallowed wholesale\r\nthe latest and most extreme political and social fads, picked up from the\r\nliterature of England, France, and Germany, but they possessed a courage of\r\ntheir convictions and a will to carry them out to the logical conclusion\r\nwhich many \"advanced thinkers\" of the West lack. They were not modernists\r\nor new theologians but atheists, not Fabians or social reformers but\r\nrevolutionary socialists armed with bombs, not radicals but republicans,\r\nnot divorce-law-reformers but \"free lovers.\" A remarkable book was\r\npublished in 1910 called _Landmarks_. It was written by a number of\r\ndisillusioned revolutionaries, and gives a vivid picture of the effect\r\nwhich the foregoing principles had upon the lives of those who upheld them.\r\nHere is one extract:\r\n\r\n\"In general, the whole manner of life of the _intelligentsia_ was terrible;\r\na long abomination of desolation, without any kind or sort of discipline,\r\nwithout the slightest consecutiveness, even on the surface. The day passes\r\nin doing nobody knows what, to-day in one manner, and to-morrow, as a\r\nresult of a sudden inspiration, entirely contrariwise--everyone lives his\r\nlife in idleness, slovenliness, and a measureless disorder--chaos and\r\nsqualor reign in his matrimonial and sexual relations--a naïve absence of\r\nconscientiousness distinguishes his work; in public affairs he shows an\r\nirrepressible inclination towards despotism, and an utter absence of\r\nconsideration towards his fellow-creatures; and his attitude towards the\r\nauthorities of the State is marked at times by a proud defiance, and at\r\nothers (individually and not collectively) by compliance.\"\r\n\r\nAs a set-off to this picture of moral chaos, it should be remembered that\r\nthese people when called upon to die for their revolutionary faith did so\r\nwith the greatest heroism. Nor is the picture true of all revolutionaries;\r\nsome of the noblest men it has ever been my good fortune to meet were\r\nRussian revolutionaries. But these were the product of an earlier and\r\nsterner school, the puritanical \"Nihilism\" of the 'eighties; and it is\r\nimpossible to deny the substantial truth of the above description as far as\r\nthe rank and file of the modern revolutionary school are concerned.[1] Such\r\npeople were divided by a whole universe from the peasants to whom they\r\noffered themselves as leaders and saviours; and the schemes of regeneration\r\nwhich they preached were not merely useless, because purely negative, but\r\nwere exotic plants which could never flourish on Russian soil. Thus the\r\nrevolution triumphed for about twelve months as a purely destructive force,\r\nbut when the necessity for construction arose its adherents found that they\r\nwere entirely ignorant of the elements of the problem before them.\r\nThis problem was the peasant, and the revolutionaries, though they had\r\nworshipped the People (with a capital P) for years and had done their best\r\nto convert them, had never made any attempt to understand them. And when\r\nthe peasant discovered what the revolutionary was like, he loathed and\r\ndetested him. \"They hate us,\" a writer in _Landmarks_ confesses, \"because\r\nthey fail to recognise that we are men. We are, in their eyes, monsters in\r\nhuman shape, men without God in their soul; and they are right.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It is confirmed by all impartial observers, see _e.g._\r\nProfessor Pares' _Russia and Reform_, chap. ix., entitled \"Lives of the\r\nIntelligents.\"]\r\n\r\nThere is a characteristic story told by Mr. Maurice Baring about a certain\r\nrevolutionary who one day arrived at a village to convert the inhabitants\r\nto socialism. \"He thought he would begin by disproving the existence of\r\nGod, because if he proved that there was no God, it would naturally follow\r\nthat there should be no Emperor and no policeman. So he took a holy picture\r\nand said, 'There is no God, and I will prove it immediately. I will spit\r\nupon this _eikon_ and break it in pieces, and if there is a God He will\r\nsend fire from heaven and kill me, and if there is no God nothing will\r\nhappen to me at all.' Then he took the _eikon_ and spat upon it and broke\r\nit to bits, and he said to the peasants, 'You see, God has not killed me.'\r\n'No,' said the peasants, 'God has not killed you, but we will'; and they\r\nkilled him.\"\r\n\r\nThis story, whether true or not, is a parable, in which one may read the\r\nwhole meaning of the failure of the Russian revolution. It shows how an\r\nattack upon what they hold sacred may rouse to acts of fury a people\r\nwho are admitted by all who know them to be the most tolerant, most\r\ntender-hearted, and most humane in Europe. The notion that Russia is a\r\nhumane country may sound strange in English ears. Yet capital punishment,\r\nwhich is still part of our legal system, was abolished in Russia as long\r\nago as 1753, except for cases of high treason. From 1855 to 1876 only one\r\nman was executed in the whole of that vast empire; and from 1876 to 1903\r\nonly 114. On the other hand between the years 1905 and 1908 the total of\r\nexecutions reached the appalling figure of 3629. This is but to translate\r\ninto criminal statistics the story just quoted; for the years 1905-8 were\r\nthe years when martial law reigned in Russia, the years of revolution.\r\nThe Tsar, it is true, wore the black cap, and the hangman's rope was\r\nmanipulated by the bureaucracy, but the jury who brought in the verdict was\r\na jury of 145 million peasants.\r\n\r\nSuch, in broad outline, is the history of the revolutionary movement which\r\nis still so greatly misunderstood in England. It was not the uprising of an\r\noppressed nation, which successful for a brief while was finally crushed by\r\nthe brute force of reaction; it was a civil war between two sections of\r\na small educated class, in which the sympathies of the nation after\r\nfluctuating for a time eventually came down heavily against the\r\nrevolutionaries. There is in truth every excuse for misunderstanding\r\namongst English people, especially if they belong to the party of progress\r\nin English politics; for the obvious things about Russia are so deceptive.\r\nAll that one saw on the surface were, on the one hand, an irresponsible\r\nbureaucracy using the knout, the secret agent, the _pogrom_, and Siberia\r\nfor the suppression of anything suspected of threatening existing\r\nconditions; and, on the other, a band of devoted reformers and\r\nrevolutionaries risking all in the cause of political liberty, and dying,\r\nthe \"Marseillaise\" on their lips, with the fortitude of Christian martyrs.\r\nBut, beneath all this, something immensely bigger was in progress,\r\nwhich can only be described as a conflict of two philosophies of life\r\ndiametrically opposed or, if you like, a life-and-death struggle between\r\ntwo civilisations, so different that they can hardly understand each\r\nother's language; it is a renewal of the Titanic contest, which was decided\r\nin the West by the Renaissance and the Reformation, the contest between\r\nthe mediaeval and the modern world. To the modern mind no period is so\r\ndifficult to grasp as the Middle Ages; our dreams are of progress which is\r\nanother word for process, of success which implies perpetual change, in\r\neither case of \"getting on\" somewhere, somehow, we know not where or how;\r\nour very universe, from which we have carefully excluded the supernatural,\r\nhas become a development machine, a huge spinning-mill, and our religion,\r\nif we have one, a matter of \"progressive revelation.\" We look before and\r\nafter, forwards to some dim utopia, backwards to some ape-like ancestor who\r\nlinks us with the animal world. Our outlook is horizontal, the mediaeval\r\noutlook perpendicular. The mediaeval man looked upward and downward, to\r\nheaven and hell, when he thought of the future, to sun and cloud, land\r\nand crops, when he thought of the present. He lived in the presence of\r\nperpetual miracle, the daily miracle of sunrise, sunset, and shower; and in\r\nthe constant faith in resurrection, whether of the corn which he sowed in\r\nthe furrow or of his body which his friends would reverently sow in that\r\ndeeper furrow, the grave. And his life was as simple and static as his\r\nuniverse; the seasons determined his labours, the Church his holidays.\r\nBooks did not disturb his faith in the unseen world, for he was illiterate;\r\nnor the lust of gold his contentment with his existence, for commerce was\r\nstill confined to a few towns. Russia to-day is in spirit what Europe was\r\nin the Middle Ages.[1] The revolutionaries offered her Western civilisation\r\nand Western philosophy, and she rejected the gift with horror.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This, of course, by no means implies that she is _behind_ the\r\nWest, or that she is of necessity bound to pass through the same process of\r\ndevelopment. The problem of modern Russia is not to imitate the West but\r\nto discover some way of coming to terms with Western ideals without\r\nsurrendering her own.]\r\n\r\nWill she continue to maintain this attitude? \"The Russian peasant,\" says\r\nMr. Maurice Baring, \"as long as he tills the ground will never abandon his\r\nreligion or the observance of it.... Because the religion of the peasant is\r\nthe working hypothesis taught him by life; and by his observance of it he\r\nfollows what he conceives to be the dictates of common sense consecrated by\r\nimmemorial custom.\" The crucial point of this passage is the conditional\r\nclause: \"as long as he tills the ground.\" Of course, Russia, the granary of\r\nEurope, must always be predominantly an agricultural country; yet she is at\r\nthe present moment threatened in many parts with an Industrial Revolution,\r\nthe ultimate effects of which may prove far more subversive than the\r\nattempted revolution of 1905. For beneath her soil lie explosive materials\r\nmore deadly than any dynamite manufactured by _intelligentsia_. Her mineral\r\nwealth, at present almost untouched, is incalculable in quantity and\r\namazing in variety. When her mines are opened up Russia will become,\r\naccording to the judgment of Dr. Kennard, editor of _The Russian\r\nYear-Book,_ \"without a doubt the richest Empire the world has ever seen.\"\r\nAttracted by her vast mining possibilities, by her enormous virgin forests,\r\nby her practically unlimited capacity for grain-production, the capital\r\nof Europe is knocking at the doors of Russia. Factories are rising, mines\r\nbeing started all over the country. Russia is about to be exploited by\r\nEuropean business enterprise, just as America and Africa have been. The\r\nworld has need of her raw materials, and is only interested in her people\r\nas potential cheap labour. Thus within the last few years something\r\nanalogous to the proletariat and the bourgeoisie of Europe has come into\r\nexistence in Russia. We may catch a glimpse of what these new classes are\r\nlike from a recent book by Mr. Stephen Graham, called _Changing Russia_. He\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n\"The Russian bourgeois is of this sort; he wants to know the price of\r\neverything. Of things which are independent of price he knows nothing,\r\nor, if he knows of them, he sneers at them and hates them. Talk to him of\r\nreligion, and show that you believe the mystery of Christ; talk to him\r\nof life, and show that you believe in love and happiness; talk to him of\r\nwoman, and show that you understand anything about her unsexually; talk\r\nto him of work, and show that though you are poor you have no regard for\r\nmoney--and the bourgeois is uneasy.... Instead of opera, the gramophone;\r\ninstead of the theatre, the kinematograph; instead of national literature,\r\nthe cheap translation; instead of national life, a miserable imitation of\r\nmodern English life.... It may be thought that there is little harm in the\r\ncommercialisation of the Russian, the secularising of his life; and that\r\nafter all the bourgeois population of England, France, and Germany is not\r\nso bad as not to be on the way to something better. But that would be a\r\nmistake; if once the Russian nation becomes thoroughly perverted, it will\r\nbe the most treacherous, most vile, most dangerous in Europe. For the\r\nperverted Russian all is possible; it is indeed his favourite maxim,\r\nborrowed, he thinks, from Nietzsche, that 'all is permitted,' and by 'all'\r\nhe means all abomination, all fearful and unheard-of bestiality, all\r\ncruelty, all falsity, all debauch.... Selfish as it is possible to be,\r\ncrass, heavy, ugly, unfaithful in marriage, unclean, impure, incapable\r\napparently of understanding the good and the true in their neighbours and\r\nin life--such is the Russian bourgeois.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graham's picture of the new proletariat in the Ural mines is an equally\r\nhorrible one:\r\n\r\n\"Gold mining is a sort of rape and incest, a crime by which earth and man\r\nare made viler. If I had doubted of its influence on man I needed but to\r\ngo to the Ural goldfields. A more drunken, murderous, brother-hating\r\npopulation than that of this district I have not seen in all Russia. It was\r\na great sorrow to see such a delightful peasantry all in debauchery....\r\nThe miner has no culture, no taste, not even a taste for property and\r\nsquiredom, so that when at a stroke he gains a hundred or a thousand\r\npounds, it is rather difficult to know how to spend it. His ideal of\r\nhappiness has been vodka, and all the bliss that money can obtain for him\r\nlies in that.... Mias is a gold-mining village of twenty-five thousand\r\ninhabitants. It has two churches, four electric theatres, fifteen vodka\r\nshops, a score of beer-houses, and many dens where cards are played and\r\nwomen bought and sold to the strains of the gramophone. It is situated in a\r\nmost lovely hollow among the hills, and, seen from the distance, it is one\r\nof the most beautiful villages of North Russia; but seen from within, it is\r\na veritable inferno.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Graham writes as a poet rather than as an economist or a sociologist,\r\nbut there is no doubt a grave danger to Russia in a sudden adoption of\r\nindustrial life.\r\n\r\n_Intelligentsia_, bourgeoisie, and proletariate are all products of the\r\nsame forces, all belong to the same family; they are westernised Russians;\r\nthey have passed from the fourteenth to the twentieth century at one\r\nstride, and the violent transition has cut them completely adrift from\r\ntradition and from all moral and religious standards; books, commerce,\r\nand industry, the three boasted instruments of our civilisation, have\r\nnot civilised such Russians, they have _de-civilised_ them. But, as yet,\r\nRussians of this character form only a tiny fraction of the nation; and\r\nthere are happily signs that the dangers of an exotic culture are being\r\nrealised even by the _intelligentsia_ themselves. Since the failure of the\r\nrevolution there has been a remarkable revival of interest among Russian\r\nthinkers in the native institutions, habits, and even the religion of the\r\ncountry; and it may be that in time there will emerge from this chaos of\r\nideals a culture and a civilisation which will \"make the best of both\r\nworlds\" by adopting Western methods without surrendering an inch of the\r\nnation's spiritual territory, above which floats the standard of religion,\r\nsimplicity, and brotherly love. The present war, terrible as it is, may do\r\nsomething towards bringing this about, for the Russian people, faced by a\r\ncommon danger and united in a common purpose, are now of one mind and one\r\nheart, in a way that they have not been since a century ago Napoleon was\r\nthundering at the gates of Moscow.\r\n\r\nAnd let this be said: if Russia should ever cease to be Russia, if she ever\r\nloses those grand national characteristics which make her so different from\r\nthe West, and therefore so difficult for us Westerns to understand, the\r\nworld as a whole will be infinitely the poorer for that loss. We need\r\nRussia even more than Russia needs us; for, while we have grasped the\r\ntrappings, she possesses the real spirit of democracy. Of the three\r\ndemocratic ideals, proclaimed by France in 1789, the mystical trinity:\r\nLiberty, Fraternity, Equality, how much has yet been realised by the\r\npeoples of the West? And Russia is in the way of realising them all!\r\nFraternity and equality are, as we have seen, the distinctive features of\r\nher national spirit and social structure, and, if her liberty is as yet\r\nimperfect on the political side, it is far more complete than ours on the\r\nside of moral tolerance and respect for the sanctity of human personality.\r\nAfter all, the reason why Russia has not got complete political freedom is\r\nbecause, as a nation, she has hitherto taken no interest in politics; for\r\nthe first time in 1905 she discovered the use of political action, and she\r\ngot out of it a solution of the agrarian distress and a representative\r\nassembly; when she _wants_ more liberty in this direction, she will have no\r\ndifficulty in securing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n§4. _The Subject Nationalities_.--It may fairly be objected at this\r\npoint that while Russia may possess these excellent qualities, she has\r\nconsistently refused to allow liberty to other peoples, to the Jews,\r\nfor example, the Poles, and the Finns. It is necessary therefore to say\r\nsomething on the matter of Russia's subject nationalities before bringing\r\nthese remarks to a conclusion.\r\n\r\nOut of the six or seven million Jews in the world, over five million live\r\nwithin the boundaries of the Russian Empire. Russia is therefore the\r\nmotherland of the Children of Israel; though, perhaps, the phrase\r\nstep-motherland would express more truly the actual relationship, both\r\nin its origin and its character. Russia has inherited her tremendous\r\nresponsibilities towards the Hebrew race from Poland, and her vexed \"Jewish\r\nquestion\" is in part a just punishment for her complicity in the wicked\r\npartitions of that country in the eighteenth century. The matter, however,\r\ngoes back much farther than the eighteenth century. In the Middle Ages\r\nPoland was a more powerful state than Russia, and comprised territory\r\nstretching from the Gulf of Riga to the Black Sea and from the Oder to the\r\nDnieper. She was also the one country in Europe which offered to the Jews\r\nsecurity from persecution and an opportunity of developing the commercial\r\ninstincts of the race without interference. The result was that Jews\r\nsettled in large numbers all over the King of Poland's possessions, and the\r\npresence of Jews in any part of modern Russia is almost a sure sign that\r\nthat particular town or province has been Polish territory in former times.\r\nThe Russian Government has never, except for a short period, allowed the\r\nJews to live in Russia proper, and it is very rare to find Jews in north\r\nor central Russia. Even in large cities like Petrograd and Moscow their\r\nnumbers are small, while it is interesting to note that the Finns have\r\ncopied the rest of Russia in this respect at least that they have always\r\nresolutely refused to admit the Hebrew. Where Russia found Jews among the\r\nnew subjects which she acquired by her gradual encroachments upon Poland,\r\nshe had of course to let them remain, but she has confined them strictly to\r\nthese districts. The existence of this Jewish pale is one of the grievances\r\nof the Jews of Russia, but it is not the heaviest. The liberal-minded\r\nAlexander II. had shown himself lenient to them; but his assassination\r\nin 1881 at the hands of terrorists and the accession of the reactionary\r\nAlexander III. began a period of persecution which has continued until the\r\npresent day.\r\n\r\nAlexander III. was much influenced by his tutor, Pobiedonostsev, who for\r\nthe next thirty years was the most prominent exponent of the philosophy of\r\nSlavophilism. This, which in its modern form may be traced back to 1835,\r\nwas in fact nothing else than a perverted glorification of the Russian\r\nnational characteristics which have been dwelt upon above. The Slavophils\r\ndeclared not only that the Russians were a great and admirable nation,\r\nwhich few who really know them will be disposed to deny, but that their\r\ninstitutions--and in particular, of course, autocracy and bureaucracy--were\r\na perfect expression of the national genius which could hardly be improved\r\nupon. Furthermore, it was maintained that, since all other countries but\r\nRussia had taken a wrong turn and fallen into decadence and libertinism, it\r\nwas Russia's mission to bring the world back into the paths of rectitude\r\nand virtue by extending the influence of her peculiar culture--and in\r\nparticular again, of course, its special manifestations, autocracy\r\nand bureaucracy--as widely as possible. A variant of Slavophilism is\r\nPanslavism, which works for the day when all members of one great Slav race\r\nwill be united in one nation, presumably under the Russian crown. Both\r\nthese movements are examples of that nationalism run mad to which reference\r\nhas been made in the second chapter.[1] But the Slavophils, who are of\r\ncourse ardent supporters of the Orthodox Church, were faced at the outset\r\nwith a great difficulty; the western provinces of Russia, from the Arctic\r\nto the Black Sea, contained masses of population which were neither Russian\r\nnor Orthodox. The Finns in the north were Lutherans; the Poles in the\r\ncentre, though Slavs, were Roman Catholic in religion and anti-Russian in\r\nsentiment; and the Jews in the centre and south were--Jews. The first\r\nstep, therefore, towards the Slavophil goal was the \"Russification\" of the\r\nsubject peoples of Russia. In theory \"Russification\" means conferring the\r\nbenefits of Russian customs, speech, and culture upon those who do not\r\nalready possess them; in practice it amounts to the suppression of local\r\nliberties and traditions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See p. 57.]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that it is no easier to make a Jew into a Russian by force\r\nthan to change the skin of the proverbial Ethiopian; nor is it likely that\r\nthe Russian Government ever entertained the idea of making such an\r\nattempt. If it had any definite plan at all, it was to render things so\r\nuncomfortable to the unfortunate Hebrews that they would gradually leave\r\nthe country. Real persecution began at the accession of Alexander III. in\r\n1881, when it spread into Russia, significantly enough, from Germany, where\r\na violent anti-Semite agitation had sprung up at the beginning of the year.\r\nRiots directed against the Jews, and winked at if not encouraged by the\r\nauthorities, broke out in the towns of Southern Russia. Edicts followed\r\nwhich excluded the Jews from all direct share in local government, refused\r\nto allow more than a small percentage of Jews to attend the schools and\r\nuniversities, forbade them to acquire property outside the towns, laid\r\nspecial taxes upon their backs, and so on. This attitude of the Government\r\nencouraged the populace of the towns to believe that they might attack the\r\nJews with impunity. The Jews are regarded in modern Russia in much the same\r\nlight as they were regarded by our forefathers in the Middle Ages. They are\r\nhated, that is to say, on two counts: as unbelievers and as usurers. The\r\ncondition of affairs in a township where the population is half-Jewish,\r\nhalf-Christian, and where the Christians are financially and commercially\r\nin the hands of the Jews, and the Jews are politically and administratively\r\nin the hands of the Christians, is obviously an extremely dangerous one.\r\nAdd to this the presence of a large hooligan section which is found in\r\nalmost every Russian town of any size, the open disfavour shown towards\r\nthe Jews by the Government, and the secret intrigues and incitement of the\r\npolice, and you get a train of circumstances which lead inevitably to those\r\nviolent anti-Semitic explosions, known as _pogroms_, which have stained the\r\npages of modern Russian history. The revolutionary movement has complicated\r\nmatters still further; for Jews are naturally to be found in the\r\nrevolutionary ranks, and the bureaucracy and its hooligan supporters have\r\ntended to identify the Jewish race with the Revolutionary Party. Nothing\r\ncan excuse the treatment of the Jews in Russia during the last thirty-five\r\nyears, and the guilt lies almost entirely upon the Government, which,\r\ninstead of leading the people and educating them by initiating an\r\nenlightened policy towards the Jews, a policy which might in fact have done\r\nmore than anything else to \"Russify\" the latter, has persistently aided and\r\nabetted the worst elements of the population in their acts of violence.\r\nIt has reaped its reward in the rise of one of the most formidable of the\r\nrevolutionary parties in modern Russia, the so-called Jewish \"Bund.\" The\r\nGovernor of Vilna, in a confidential report written in 1903, declared that\r\n\"this political movement is undoubtedly a result of the abnormal position\r\nof the Jews, legal and economic, which has been created by our legislation.\r\nA revision of the laws concerning the Jews is absolutely urgent, and every\r\npostponement of it is pregnant with the most dangerous consequences.\"\r\n\r\nYet when we condemn Russia for her _pogroms_ and her Jew-baitings, we must\r\nnot forget two facts: first, that these occurrences are the work, not of\r\nthe real Russian people, the peasantry which has been described above, but\r\nof the dregs of the population which are to be found at the base of the\r\nsocial structure in the towns of Russia as in towns nearer home; second,\r\nthat Russia is not the only country in the world that has these racial\r\nproblems to face. I once heard a Russian and an American discussing the\r\ncomparative demerits of their respective lands, and I am bound to say that\r\nthe former held his own very well. When, for example, the American said,\r\n\"What about the Jews?\" the other answered, \"Well, what about the negroes?\"\r\nand he parried the further question, \"What about _pogroms_?\" with another\r\nof his own, \"What about lynching?\" The problems are not, of course, quite\r\non all fours, nor do two wrongs make a right, but a reminder that similar\r\nproblems exist in other parts of the world will perhaps be enough to show\r\nthat the Jewish question in Russia is neither unique nor at all easy to\r\nsolve. Let us, instead of visiting the sins of a few townships upon the\r\nheads of the entire Russian nation, be thankful that we have no such\r\nproblems in our own islands. Recent riots outside the shops of German\r\npork-butchers in different parts of the country do not, it must be\r\nconfessed, lead one to hope that our people would behave much more calmly\r\nand discreetly than the Whites of the Southern States or the Christians of\r\nSouth-West Russia, were they placed in the same circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe Polish question is at once simpler and its story less damaging to the\r\nRussian Government than that of the Jews. The partitions, an account of\r\nwhich has already been given,[1] were of course iniquitous, but, as we have\r\nseen, Prussia must bear the chief blame for them. In any case, the Tsar\r\nAlexander I. did his utmost for Poland at the Congress of Vienna in 1815.\r\nHe pleaded eloquently for a reunited Poland, and he almost won over Prussia\r\nby making arrangements to compensate her for her Polish territory at the\r\nexpense of Saxony. But France, England, and Austria opposed his project,\r\nand he was obliged to yield to the combined pressure of these powers.\r\nRussia is, therefore, not more but less guilty of the present dismembered\r\nstate of Poland than her Western neighbours, among whom we must not forget\r\nourselves;[2] and she is to-day only attempting to carry out the promise\r\nwhich she made, but was not allowed to fulfill, a century ago. Disappointed\r\nas he was, Alexander I. made the best of a bad job by granting a liberal\r\nconstitution to that part of Poland which the Congress assigned to\r\nRussia. Indeed he did everything possible, short of a grant of absolute\r\nindependence, which at that time would have been absurd, to conciliate\r\npublic opinion in the Grand-Duchy of Warsaw. Unfortunately the experiment\r\nproved a complete failure, largely owing to the factious and self-seeking\r\nPolish nobility who have always been the worst enemy of their country.\r\nAlexander after a time lost patience, and in 1820 he felt compelled to\r\nwithdraw some of the liberties which he had conferred in 1815. After this\r\nthe breach between the Russian Government and the Polish people began to\r\nwiden, partly owing to stupid and clumsy actions on the side of Russia,\r\npartly to the incurable lack of political common-sense on the side of the\r\nupper classes in Poland, partly to the fact that the country could never\r\nbe anything but restless and unsatisfied while it remained divided. The\r\nhistory of Russian Poland since the time of Alexander is the history of two\r\ngreat failures to throw off the Russian yoke, the failure of 1830 and of\r\n1863. These risings were marked by heroism, disunion, and incapacity on the\r\none side, and by relentless repression on the other. The upshot was that\r\nPoland was deprived of her constitutional rights one by one, until finally\r\nshe became nothing more than so many provinces of Russia itself. To some\r\nextent, however, the failure of 1863 proved a blessing in disguise. The\r\nrising had been almost entirely confined to the nobility; Russia therefore\r\nturned to the peasants of Poland, released them from all obligations to\r\nwork upon the estates of the large landowners, and handed over to them at\r\nleast half the land of the country as freehold property. The result of\r\nthis measure, and of the removal of the customs barrier between the two\r\ncountries in 1877, was twofold: the power of the factious nobility was\r\nshattered for ever, and a marvellous development of industry took place in\r\nPoland which has united her to Russia \"with chains of self-interest\r\nlikely to prove a serious obstacle to the realisation of Polish hopes of\r\nindependence.\"[3] It is indeed doubtful whether at this date the\r\nPoles cherish any such hopes. What they desire is national unity and\r\nself-government rather than sovereign independence, and they know that they\r\nare at least as likely to receive these from Russia as from Prussia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pp. 24-27.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: As a matter of fact our representative, Lord Castlereagh, was\r\nAlexander's chief opponent at the Congress in the question of Poland. See\r\n_Camb. Mod. Hist._ vol. x. p. 445.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Camb. Mod. Hist._ vol. xi. p. 629.]\r\n\r\nWhile of late years the relations between Russia and Poland have steadily\r\nimproved, those between Russia and Finland, on the contrary, have grown\r\nrapidly worse. Until 1809 Finland was a Grand-Duchy under the Swedish\r\ncrown, but in that year, owing to a war which had broken out between Russia\r\nand Sweden, she passed into the control of the nearer and more powerful\r\nState, after putting up a stubborn resistance to annexation which will\r\nalways figure as the most glorious episode in the annals of the country.\r\nAlexander I., who was at that time Tsar, adopted the same policy towards\r\nFinland as he did towards Poland. He refused to incorporate the new\r\nprovince into the Russian State-system, he took the title of Grand-Duke\r\nof Finland (thereby implying that she lay outside the Empire), and he\r\nconfirmed the ancient liberties of the Finns. Later on they even secured\r\ngreater liberty than they had possessed under Sweden by the grant of a\r\nFinnish Diet, on the lines of the Swedish Diet in Stockholm, which should\r\nhave full control of all internal Finnish affairs. Finland, therefore,\r\ngained much from the transfer; she possessed for the first time in her\r\nhistory complete internal autonomy. This state of things lasted for\r\npractically ninety years, during which period Finland made wonderful\r\nprogress both economic and intellectual, so that by the end of the\r\nnineteenth century she was one of the happiest, most enlightened, and most\r\nprosperous countries in Northern Europe. \"As regards the condition of\r\nFinland,\" Alexander I. had declared, \"my intention has been to give\r\nthis people a political existence, so that they may not feel themselves\r\nconquered by Russia, but united to her for their own clear advantage;\r\ntherefore, not only their civil but their political laws have been\r\nmaintained.\" This liberal policy was continued by the various Tsars\r\nthroughout the century, the reformer Alexander II. taking particular\r\ninterest in the development of the Grand-Duchy, which he evidently regarded\r\nas a place where experiments in political liberty were being worked\r\nout that might later be applied to the rest of Russia. The weakness of\r\nFinland's position lay in the fact that her liberties really depended upon\r\nthe personal whim of the Grand-Duke: in theory her constitutional laws were\r\nonly alterable by the joint sanction of monarch and people; in practice the\r\nsmall but courageous nation had no means of redress should the Tsar,\r\nswayed by bureaucratic reaction, choose to go back upon the policy of his\r\nancestors. And in 1894 a Tsar mounted the throne, Nicholas II., who did so\r\nchoose.\r\n\r\nThe word went forth for the \"Russification\" of Finland. After picking a\r\nquarrel with the Diet on the military question, the Tsar on February 18,\r\n1899, issued a manifesto suspending the Finnish Constitution and abolishing\r\nthe Diet. Finland became with a stroke of the pen a department of the\r\nRussian Empire. A rigorous Press censorship was established, the hated\r\ngovernor-general Bobrikoff filled the country with gendarmes and spies,\r\nnative officials were dismissed or driven to resign, an attempt was made\r\nto introduce the Russian language into the schools, and, though the Finns\r\ncould only oppose a campaign of passive resistance to these wicked and\r\nshort-sighted measures, at the end of seven years the nation which had for\r\nalmost a century been the most contented portion of the Tsar's dominions\r\nwas seething with ill-feeling and disloyalty. The inevitable outcome was\r\nthe assassination of General Bobrikoff by a young student in June 1904; and\r\nwhen the Russian universal strike took place in October 1905, the entire\r\nFinnish nation joined in as one man. Finland regained her liberties for\r\na time, and immediately set to work putting her house in order by\r\nsubstituting for her old mediaeval constitution a brand new one, based on\r\nuniversal suffrage, male and female, and employing such up-to-date\r\ndevices as proportional representation. The only result of seven years'\r\n\"Russification\" was the creation of a united democracy, with a strong\r\nsocialistic leaven, in place of a nation governed by an antiquated\r\naristocratic Diet, and divided into two hostile political camps on the\r\nquestion whether Swedish or Finnish should be the language of the national\r\nculture. But the fortunes of Finland were accidentally but inextricably\r\nbound up with those of the party of reform in Russia, and when the\r\nbureaucracy, after the downfall of the revolutionaries, found itself once\r\nmore firmly seated in the saddle, it returned to the attack on the Finnish\r\nConstitution, not indeed with the open and brutal methods of Bobrikoff, but\r\nby gradual and insidious means no less effective. And it must be admitted\r\nthat the Russian Duma, as \"reformed\" by Stolypin, so far from being of\r\nany help to Finland in the struggle, has been made the instrument of the\r\ndestruction of her liberties.\r\n\r\nFinland is in a very unfortunate position. Geographically she is bound to\r\nform part of the Russian Empire; even the extremest Russophobes in the\r\ncountry have long ago given up hopes of re-union with Sweden; and yet the\r\nfrontier between Finland and Russia is one which divides two worlds, as all\r\nwho have made the journey from Helsingfors to Petrograd must have noticed.\r\nIn literature, art, education, politics, commerce, industry, and social\r\nreform Finland is as much alive as any of the Scandinavian States from\r\nwhom she first derived her culture. In many ways indeed she is the most\r\nprogressive country in Europe, and it is her proud boast that she is\r\n\"Framtidsland,\" the land of the future. Lutheran in religion, non-Slavonic\r\nin race, without army, court, or aristocracy, and consequently without\r\nthe traditions which these institutions carry with them, she presents the\r\ngreatest imaginable contrast to the Empire with which she is irrevocably\r\nlinked. Finland is Western of the Westerns, and keenly conscious of the\r\nfact just because of this irrevocable link; Russia is--Russia! And yet, as\r\npart of the Russian system, she must come to terms sooner or later with the\r\nEmpire; she cannot receive the protection of the Russian military forces, a\r\nprotection to the value of which, if reports be true, she is at the present\r\nmoment very much alive, and yet retain her claims to be what is virtually\r\nan independent State. That these claims have been pitched on a high note\r\nis no doubt largely the fault of the blundering and cruel policy of the\r\nRussian bureaucracy. But it must be admitted that Finland has never tried\r\nin the very least to understand her mighty neighbour; she has always sat,\r\nas it were, with her back to Russia, looking westwards, and her statesmen\r\nhave not even taken the trouble to learn the Russian language. There has,\r\nin fact, been something a little \"priggish\" in her superior attitude, in\r\nher perpetually drawn comparison between Russian \"barbarism\" and Finnish\r\n\"culture.\" Though her capital, Helsingfors, is but twelve hours by rail\r\nfrom Petrograd, Finland knows as little of the interior of Russia as people\r\ndo in England.\r\n\r\nThe policy of the Russian Government, on the other hand, has been marked\r\nby that inconsistency, political blindness, and arbitrariness which one\r\nexpects from an irresponsible bureaucracy. For ninety years Finland was\r\nleft alone to work out her own salvation, entirely apart from that of the\r\nrest of the Empire; and then suddenly it was discovered that her coasts\r\nwere of the highest strategical importance, and that she was developing a\r\ncommercial and industrial system in dangerous competition with the tender\r\nplant of commerce and industry in Russia itself. The Slavophils raised an\r\noutcry, and the decree went out that the Russian whale should swallow this\r\nactive and prosperous little Jonah. The former policy was really as stupid,\r\nthough less cruel, than the latter. Had there been anything like that\r\nsteady political tradition and wide political experience in Russia which we\r\ncan draw upon in England, the Imperial Government would have from the first\r\nendeavoured to draw Finland closer to the Empire, not by bands of steel and\r\niron but by the more delicate and more permanent ties of considerateness,\r\naffection, and self-interest. It is political stupidity, based upon\r\nignorance and inexperience, and not inhumanity, which is the real\r\nexplanation of Russia's unfortunate relations with her subject peoples\r\nduring the past century. Moreover, the political machinery which has\r\nhitherto served her own internal needs is the worst possible instrument for\r\ndealing with provinces which possess a full measure of Western political\r\nconsciousness together with the traditions of political liberty. Russia,\r\ntherefore, requires representative institutions not merely for the\r\npolitical education of her own people and as a check upon bureaucratic\r\ntyranny and incompetency, but also in order that she may adopt some fair\r\nand _consistent_ policy towards her subject nationalities.\r\n\r\nIt may be optimistic, but I cannot help feeling that the present war will\r\ndo much for Russia, much for Finland, much for Poland. Russia is\r\nfighting to defend a small nation against oppression, she is fighting\r\na life-and-death struggle with the military bureaucracy which we call\r\n\"Germany\" for the moment, she is fighting on behalf of \"liberty\" and of the\r\n\"scraps of paper\" upon which the freedom of States and individuals depends.\r\nAll this will leave a profound effect upon the national consciousness, and\r\nmay even bring home for the first time to the people at large the meaning\r\nof political freedom. Russia is so vast, so loose in structure, so\r\nundeveloped in those means of intercommunication such as roads, railways,\r\nnewspapers, etc., which make England like a small village-community in\r\ncomparison, that it takes the shock of a great war to draw the whole people\r\ntogether. That it has done so, no one who has read the papers during the\r\nlast two months can doubt. War, as a historical fact, has always been\r\nbeneficial to Russia; the Crimean War led to the emancipation of the serfs,\r\nthe Japanese War led to the establishment of a Duma, and the present war\r\nhas already led to surprising results. The consumption of alcohol has been\r\nabolished, concessions have been promised to a reunited Poland, and,\r\nexcept against the unhappy Jews in the Polish war-area, there has been a\r\nsubsidence throughout the Empire of racial antagonism. It is the hope of\r\nall who love Russia, and no one who really knows her can help loving her,\r\nthat these beginnings may be crowned not only with victory over Germany in\r\nthe field of battle but with victory over the German spirit in the world of\r\nideas, a victory of which the first-fruits would be the firm establishment\r\nof representative government, a cleansing of the bureaucratic Augean\r\nstables, and a settlement of the problem of subject nationalities upon\r\nlines of justice and moderation.\r\n\r\nBut whatever the outcome may be, let us in England be fair to Russia.\r\nThe road to fairness lies through understanding; and we have grossly\r\nmisunderstood Russia because we have not taken the trouble to acquaint\r\nourselves with the facts, the real facts as distinct from the newspaper\r\nfacts, of her situation. When those facts are realised, is it for us to\r\ncast the first stone? Russia needs political reform, the tremendous task\r\nof Peter the Great needs completing, the bureaucracy must be crowned\r\nwith representative institutions; but is Russia's need in the sphere of\r\npolitical reform greater than ours in the sphere of social reform?\r\n\r\nLook at our vast miserable slums, our sprawling, ugly, aimless industrial\r\ncentres, inhabited by millions who have just enough education to be able to\r\nbuy their thinking ready-made through the halfpenny Press and just enough\r\nleisure for a weekly attendance at the local football match and an annual\r\nexcursion to Blackpool or Ramsgate; who seldom, if ever, see the glorious\r\nface of Nature and, when they do, gaze into it with blank unrecognising\r\neyes; whose whole life is one long round of monotony--monotonous toil,\r\nmonotonous amusements, monotonous clothes, monotonous bricks and\r\nmortar;--until the very heaven itself, with its trailing cloud-armadas and\r\nits eternal stars, is forgotten, and the whole universe becomes a cowl of\r\nhodden grey, \"where-under crawling cooped they live and die.\" And then look\r\nat those other millions--the millions of Russia--look at the grand simple\r\nlife they lead in the fields, a life of toil indeed, but of toil sweet and\r\ninfinitely varied; Russia is their country, not merely because they live\r\nthere but because they--the peasants--now actually possess by far the\r\ngreater part of the arable land; God is their God, not because they have\r\nheard of Him as some remote Being in the Sunday School, but because He\r\nis very near to them--in their homes, in their sacraments, and in their\r\nhearts; and so contentment of mind and soul is theirs, not because they\r\nhave climbed higher than their fellows, whether by the accumulation of\r\nknowledge or wealth, but because they have discovered the secret of\r\nexistence, which is to want little, to live in close communion with nature,\r\nand to die in close communion with God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nMAURICE BARING. _The Mainsprings of Russia._ 1914.

Was this war necessary? Or was\r\nit caused by the ambitions and foolishness of statesmen? Might it not have\r\nbeen averted if the peoples of Europe had had more control over the way in\r\nwhich foreign policy was carried on?\r\n\r\nOut of these questions has arisen a demand for the \"democratisation of\r\nforeign policy\"; that is, for greater popular control over diplomatic\r\nnegotiations. In view of this, it becomes necessary for every British\r\ncitizen to gain some idea of what foreign policy is and by what principles\r\nit should be governed.\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this chapter to give, first, some account of the\r\nactual meaning of the words \"foreign policy,\" and then, secondly, to\r\nconsider how foreign policy may best be controlled in the interests of the\r\nwhole population of the British Empire, and in the interests of the world\r\nat large.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. THE MEANING OF FOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\n§1. _The Foreign Office._--To the ordinary man foreign policy is an affair\r\nof mystery, and it not unnaturally rouses his suspicions. He does not\r\nrealise, what is nevertheless the simple truth, that he himself is both the\r\nmaterial and the object of all foreign policy.\r\n\r\nThe business of the Government of a country is to maintain and further the\r\ninterests of the individual citizen. That is the starting-point of all\r\npolitical institutions. The business of the Foreign Office is a part of\r\nthis work of Government, and consists in the protection of the interests of\r\nthe individual citizen where those interests depend upon the goodwill of a\r\nforeign Government.\r\n\r\nBut just as in domestic politics the individual citizen is inclined to\r\nsuspect--too often with truth--that the Government does not give impartial\r\nattention to the interests of all the citizens, but is preoccupied in\r\nprotecting the interests of powerful and privileged persons or groups, so\r\nin foreign policy the individual citizen is particularly prone to believe\r\nthat the time of the Foreign Office is taken up in furthering the interests\r\nof rich bondholders or powerful capitalists. Moreover, the charge is\r\nsometimes heard that some of the most powerful of these capitalists are\r\nengaged in the manufacture of armaments, and that the Foreign Office\r\naims at securing orders from foreign Governments for these firms, thus\r\nencouraging the nations of the world to provide themselves with means of\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nNow, just as no sensible man will say that Governments do not often oppress\r\nthe people under their care, so no sensible man will contend that Foreign\r\nOffices do not sometimes sin in the same way. But let us try to give an\r\naccurate picture of the work on which the British Foreign Office spends its\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the Foreign Office consists of:\r\n\r\n(1) An office, situated in Downing Street, manned by a number of clerks,\r\nunder the direction of the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs.\r\n\r\n(2) The Diplomatic Service--that is to say, from three to eight officials\r\nresiding in the capital of each foreign country. In the more important\r\ncountries these officials are called an Embassy, and are under the\r\ndirection of an Ambassador; in the smaller countries they are called a\r\nLegation, and are under the direction of a Minister. These Ambassadors and\r\nMinisters receive instructions from and report to the Secretary of State\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, and are the mouthpiece of the British Government in\r\nall business which Great Britain transacts with foreign countries.\r\n\r\n(3) The Consular Service--that is to say, a large number of officials,\r\ncalled Consuls, distributed over all the towns of the world where British\r\nsubjects have important trade connections or where there are a considerable\r\nnumber of British subjects. These Consuls are under the direction of the\r\nForeign Office and of the Embassy or Legation in the country where they\r\nreside, and their business is to assist British trade and protect British\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n§2. _The Work of the Foreign Office._--The work of this whole organisation\r\nmay be divided into four classes:\r\n\r\n(1) The protection of individual British subjects. This protection often\r\nextends to the most petty matters. Through the offices of a Consul and\r\nof an Embassy or Legation flows day by day a continual stream of British\r\nsubjects who are in small difficulties or have small grievances against the\r\nofficials of the country. One old lady has lost her luggage; a working man\r\nis stranded without work and wants to get back to England; a commercial\r\ntraveller has got into trouble with the customs officials and asks for\r\nredress. But the protection thus given is often concerned with very\r\nimportant matters, and is constantly employed on behalf of the poorest and\r\nthe most helpless. For instance, our officials in the United States are\r\nconstantly occupied, in assisting British immigrant working men and women\r\nwho are suffering hardships under the stringent provisions of the United\r\nStates immigration laws.\r\n\r\n(2) The furthering of British trade. It is the duty of the whole Foreign\r\nOffice organisation, but especially of the Consuls, to give advice to the\r\nrepresentatives of commercial firms, to report openings for the sale of\r\nBritish goods abroad, and generally to give assistance to British trade\r\nin its competition with foreign trade. Enquiries will, for instance, be\r\nreceived by a Consul at a Chinese port from a manufacturer of pottery or\r\nharness or tin-tacks, asking what type of goods will be likely to find\r\na market in that locality. The Consul will then enquire and give such\r\ninformation as his local knowledge enables him to supply. Or again,\r\na foreign country will sometimes make regulations which hinder the\r\nimportation of English products. English oats may, for instance, be\r\naffected with a blight which Italy fears may infect her crops if she allows\r\ntheir importation. It may then become the duty of the British Embassy at\r\nRome to make arrangements with the Italian Government in order that English\r\nfarmers may not suffer by losing the market for their produce. But one\r\nimportant point must be remembered, because it is too often forgotten by\r\nthose who criticise the Foreign Office. There is one general restriction on\r\nthe activities of the Foreign Office in assisting British trade: no British\r\nofficial is allowed to invite, or try to persuade, any foreign Government\r\nto give orders to British firms, whether for war material or for any other\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nWhat we have already said applies to the relations between civilised\r\ncountries. But the relations between civilised countries on the one hand,\r\nand uncivilised or semi-civilised countries on the other hand, are very\r\nmuch more difficult in many ways. Difficulties especially arise with regard\r\nto commerce. Many of the less-developed countries of the world, such\r\nas some South American countries and China, cannot, like their richer\r\nneighbours, undertake the development of their own resources. They lack\r\nmoney, scientific training, business ability, and so on. They therefore\r\ngive what are called \"concessions\" to foreign companies or capitalists;\r\nthat is, the Government of the country leases some industry for a term of\r\nyears to the foreign company. The Mexican Government, for instance, has\r\nleased its oil-wells to English, American, and Dutch companies, and the\r\nChinese Government has largely confided the construction and management of\r\nits railroads to English, French, and German companies.\r\n\r\nNow, in many countries where this happens, the Government is not strong\r\nenough or permanent enough to guarantee proper security of tenure to the\r\nforeign company to which it grants a concession; very likely some official\r\nis bribed to grant the concession to one company and then bribed by another\r\ncompany to cancel it, or the Government is overthrown by a revolution\r\nand its successor cancels the concessions it has granted. By this means,\r\nBritish workmen may be thrown out of work and their employment may pass\r\nto workmen in the United States or Germany. Consequently, foreign\r\nGovernments--the Governments of civilised countries--gradually begin to\r\nintervene and give protection to their subjects who have concessions in\r\nsuch countries, provided that they have obtained their concessions in a\r\nrespectable and proper manner. Competition between the different foreign\r\ncompanies then grows up; their Governments gradually begin to support them\r\nagainst each other in this competition, until at last it becomes necessary\r\nfor the different Governments, if bad feeling is to be avoided, to try to\r\narrive at some arrangement among themselves, fixing the way in which\r\nthe concessions granted by this or that semi-civilised country shall be\r\ndistributed among the subjects of the Great Powers. Something like this has\r\nbeen recently happening in China.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent this line of action seems to be necessary in dealing\r\nwith backward countries, and it may be made mutually beneficial both to\r\nthose countries themselves and to the commerce of the Great Powers, but,\r\non the other hand, the whole policy is obviously liable to great abuse.\r\nConsequently, every self-respecting Government knows that all matters\r\nrelating to concessions must be treated with the greatest caution and\r\nforbearance, and that the interests of all concerned will be best served\r\nin the long run by gradually helping backward countries along the path of\r\ncivilisation and strengthening their Governments so that they may be able\r\nto assume complete control of their own finance and commercial enterprises.\r\n\r\nWe have now described roughly the personal and the commercial work of the\r\nForeign Office. This work covers all the immediate interests of individual\r\nBritish citizens in regard to foreign countries. If each British subject\r\nis protected when abroad, and if the trade and industry of the country on\r\nwhich the welfare and livelihood of every individual citizen ultimately\r\ndepends is fostered and safe-guarded, then the primary duties of the\r\nBritish Government in relation to other Governments have been discharged.\r\n\r\nBut this is not enough. If the interests of the individual citizen of Great\r\nBritain are to be permanently secured in relation to foreign countries, we\r\nmust be assured that the policy of foreign Governments is civilised and\r\ngenerally friendly to British subjects. There must be a general rule of law\r\nthroughout the world on which British subjects can count with assurance of\r\nsafety. And so the Foreign Office has a third and even more important class\r\nof work:\r\n\r\n(3) The maintenance of permanent good relations with foreign countries.\r\nThese good relations are secured, not only by continually friendly\r\ncommunication with foreign Governments over innumerable questions of\r\npolicy, but also by the conclusion of a network of treaties, some of them\r\ndesigned to establish international co-operation in particular social or\r\neconomic questions such, for instance, as the existing treaty between Great\r\nBritain and France providing for the mutual payment of compensation under\r\nthe Workmen's Compensation Laws of the two countries, and others concluded\r\nwith the object of defining the mutual policy of different countries in\r\ngeneral matters such as the regulation of trade. The newest and most\r\nimportant class of treaties are those which, like the Hague Conventions and\r\nthe treaties guaranteeing the neutrality of Belgium and Luxemburg, attempt\r\nto lay down general rules of law which all countries agree to observe.\r\nIn other words, the office of diplomacy is to secure _certainty_ in the\r\ngovernment of the world, so that every man may know what to expect in\r\ndealing with his fellow-man of a different nationality.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to describe adequately the complexity of this diplomatic\r\nwork. The economic and social systems of the world have become so involved\r\nand intertwined that there is hardly anything one country can do which does\r\nnot react in some way on the interests of the subjects of another country.\r\n\r\nIn every European country, and in the United States, the Government is\r\nbeing more and more called upon to regulate the delicate economic and\r\nsocial machinery on which modern life depends. Each Government adopts an\r\nattitude towards such problems which is determined partly by the thought\r\nand the beliefs of its public men, and partly by the course of historical\r\ndevelopment through which each country has passed. There thus arises\r\ngradually in each country a more or less definite policy with which the\r\ncountry becomes identified. Formerly the policy of most European countries\r\nwas mainly confined to questions arising in Europe itself, but in these\r\ndays of industrial expansion the real aims of their policy generally lie\r\noutside Europe.\r\n\r\nThere are vast regions of the world where civilised government does not\r\nexist, or is only beginning to exist, but where the citizens of civilised\r\ncountries travel and carry on trade. No civilised country can prevent its\r\ntraders going where they please--indeed, the prosperity of every great\r\ncountry now depends to some extent at least upon its traders finding\r\nnew markets for the sale of their goods--but if these traders go to an\r\nuncivilised country like Central Africa or the interior of China or the\r\nSouth Sea Islands the civilised country not only feels obliged to protect\r\nthem there, but it must also, by every claim of justice and humanity,\r\nprevent them from ill-using the uncivilised and helpless natives.\r\n\r\nThe horrors which accompany the unregulated activity of foreign traders in\r\na savage country may be seen from the _Life of John G. Paton,_ a missionary\r\nin the New Hebrides Islands of the Southern Pacific. These islands, before\r\nthey came under the government of any civilised Power, were visited by\r\nEuropean and American traders, especially traders in sandalwood. \"The\r\nsandalwood traders,\" wrote Paton, \"are as a class the most godless of\r\nmen.... By them the poor defenceless natives are oppressed and robbed on\r\nevery hand; and if they offer the slightest resistance they are ruthlessly\r\nsilenced by the musket or revolver.... The sale of intoxicants, opium,\r\nfire-arms, and ammunition by the traders among the New Hebrideans, had\r\nbecome a terrible and intolerable evil.\" It became necessary for the\r\ncivilised Powers to prohibit, by international regulation, the sale of\r\nfire-arms and intoxicants in the islands. Such international regulations\r\nare always very difficult to enforce, and finally the administration of the\r\nislands was taken over by Great Britain and France, who now govern them\r\njointly.\r\n\r\nHence the civilised countries of the world have gradually been led to\r\nassume jurisdiction in uncivilised regions, and have converted many of them\r\ninto colonies or \"protectorates\" or \"spheres of influence.\" By this process\r\nthe interests of the nations of Europe reach out into all the far corners\r\nof the earth, and constant care and arrangement is needed to prevent those\r\ninterests clashing. Where the interests of the different Powers do clash in\r\nan uncivilised or semi-civilised part of the world a general international\r\nagreement is often necessary to put things straight; for instance, during\r\nrecent years the interests of Germany, France, and Spain--and to a less\r\ndegree those of many other countries--were continually clashing in Morocco,\r\ntill it became necessary in 1906 to conclude a general international treaty\r\ncalled the Algeciras Act, whereby the relations of all the Powers with\r\nregard to Morocco were defined in great detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n§3. _The Balance of Power._--It is this continual attempt to arrange\r\nmatters and to keep the different Powers clear of each other in order that\r\ntheir interests may not clash, which is the real underlying cause to-day of\r\nwhat is known as the \"Balance of Power.\" The doctrine of the \"Balance\r\nof Power\" grew up at the end of the seventeenth and beginning of the\r\neighteenth century when Europe was threatened by the policy of aggression\r\nand conquest undertaken by Louis XIV. of France. From that day onward,\r\nEuropean statesmen have sought to establish a definite European system and\r\nto limit the growth of the European States in such a way as to ensure that\r\nno State should be so strong as to threaten its neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe history of this attempt has been somewhat as follows. A coalition of\r\nthe States of Europe was formed against the aggressions of Louis XIV.\r\nAfter a series of wars a peace was signed at Utrecht in 1713 defining the\r\nboundaries of the European States in such a way as to establish equality\r\nand a balance of power between them. For about ten years European statesmen\r\nattempted to maintain the system thus set up by means of what has since\r\ncome to be known as the \"Concert of Europe\"--that is, by means of a series\r\nof international congresses where opportunity was given for the settlement\r\nof disputes between the different States. Soon, however, it became\r\nimpossible to satisfy the ambitions of the rulers and peoples of Europe by\r\nthis means, and the Concert of Europe broke up. Wars followed, during which\r\nthose statesmen, especially in England, who believed in the \"Balance of\r\nPower\" sought to prevent any European nation from being overwhelmed by its\r\nenemies. To this end, England supported Austria against the attacks of\r\nPrussia, and then later supported Prussia against a coalition formed by the\r\nrest of Europe to crush her. Unfortunately neither England nor France had\r\nsufficient strength or courage to prevent the partition of Poland between\r\nPrussia, Russia and Austria, which constituted a fatal violation of the\r\nBalance of Power. Peace did not return to Europe till 1815, when the whole\r\ncontinent had been driven to combine for the overthrow of Napoleon. At the\r\nCongress of Vienna in that year the \"Concert of Europe\" was revived, and\r\nfor more than thirty years it practically succeeded by means of a series\r\nof international congresses in maintaining a stable and balanced system in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nBut this \"Concert of Europe\" was the very thing against which the\r\ndemocratic forces on the continent finally rebelled, for the \"Concert\" took\r\nthe form of the so-called \"Holy Alliance\" between the rulers of Europe,\r\nwhose object was to prevent popular movements from disturbing the neat and\r\norderly peace which they had created. The system created by the Congress of\r\nVienna began to break down in 1848. Since then the warlike nationalist and\r\ndemocratic movements in Europe, followed by the tremendous economic growth\r\nof the European nations, have made it almost impossible to secure any\r\nstable balance of power, though a more or less successful attempt to\r\nestablish such a balance in the affairs of south-eastern Europe was made at\r\nthe Congress of Berlin in 1878. The two Hague Conferences of 1899 and 1907\r\ndid little but reveal the mutual fears and suspicions of the European\r\nnations, though many statesmen, especially English and American, laboured\r\nsincerely to make the Hague Conventions the guarantee of a lasting peace.\r\nBut it must be observed that the \"Balance of Power,\" which was originally a\r\ndistinctly European conception, has now become a world-wide conception. In\r\norder to secure a balance of power between the European States it is no\r\nlonger sufficient to settle European frontiers; it is necessary to settle\r\nand, as it were, dovetail into each other the economic interests of the\r\nEuropean countries in Africa, Asia, and the Southern Pacific. It is also\r\nnecessary to define the relations of European countries to the States in\r\nNorth and South America.\r\n\r\nWhat is the conclusion to be drawn from this history? The idea of the\r\nBalance of Power is unsatisfactory. You cannot really \"balance\" living\r\nforces. Nations are not dead masses which can be weighed against each\r\nother, but living growths which expand according to obscure natural laws.\r\nHuman laws can never stop natural growth; growth can only be stopped by\r\ndeath, and so the Balance of Power seems to necessitate continual conflict.\r\nAnd so, at least twice in the last two centuries, the attempt to maintain a\r\nstable European system by a peaceful \"Concert of Europe\" has broken down.\r\nOnce, in the Holy Alliance, that Concert itself became an intolerable\r\ntyranny. Many men to-day hope to secure peace by re-establishing the\r\nConcert of Europe on a democratic basis, but it may well be doubted whether\r\nany such system can be permanent, unless there be a radical reform in the\r\nmind and character not only of European statesmen but of the European\r\npeoples. We shall discuss this later, but meanwhile we may say this at\r\nleast. A balance of power is an imperfect conception. It is a rough and\r\nready--almost barbarous--policy. The best that can be said for it is that\r\nno alternative policy has been devised, or at least none has succeeded.\r\nEvery one of us who has a spark of idealism believes that the day will come\r\nwhen it shall give place to some more perfect system. But at the present\r\nday not only international politics but also home politics are governed\r\nby this idea of a balance of power. No democracy has yet been able to\r\nestablish itself in any country except by virtue of a continual conflict\r\nbetween class and class, between interest and interest, between capital and\r\nlabour, and international conflicts are but the reflection of the domestic\r\nconflicts within each State; both are continual unsuccessful attempts to\r\nreach a stable equilibrium, and they can only be ended by a true fusion of\r\nhearts and wills.\r\n\r\n\r\n§4. _The Estimation of National Forces._--It has been necessary to\r\nundertake this long discussion in order to give a more or less clear idea\r\nof the work done by diplomacy in maintaining a stable international system.\r\nArising out of this we have now to consider the fourth class of work--and\r\nthe most difficult--which the Foreign Office has to perform. For want of a\r\nbetter name we may call it--\r\n\r\n(4) The estimation of national forces. Nations are not mere agglomerations\r\nof individuals; they have each their own character, their own feelings,\r\nand their own life. Science has done little to determine the laws of\r\ntheir growth, but, as we have seen, each nation does grow, reaches out\r\nslowly--almost insensibly--in this or that direction, and gathers to itself\r\nnew interests which in their turn give new impulse to its growth. Perhaps\r\nthe best simile that we can use for the foreign policy of the world is that\r\nof a rather tangled garden, where creepers are continually growing and\r\ntaking root in new soil and where life is therefore always threatening\r\nand being threatened by new life. The point is that we are dealing with\r\n_life_--with its growth and decay; not with the movements of pieces on a\r\nchequer-board.\r\n\r\nNow, the Foreign Office largely exists in order to watch this growth and,\r\nlike a gardener, to train and lead it in directions where it can\r\nexpand without danger. But for this work intimate knowledge is\r\nnecessary--knowledge not so much of the personal character or policy of\r\nthose who govern the different nations, but knowledge of the character,\r\nthe economic needs, the beliefs, the feelings, and the aspirations of the\r\nhalf-dumb millions who form and ultimately determine the life of each\r\nnation. The diplomatist must study every political and social movement\r\nwhich goes on in a nation; he must estimate the effect which the national\r\nsystem of education is having on the mind of the nation; he must form an\r\nidea of the lessons which the Government of his own country should learn\r\nfrom the government of other countries, whether it be, for instance,\r\nlessons in constitutional government or in municipal sanitation; and he\r\nmust above all be able to warn his Government of the dangers to his own\r\ncountry which the growth of foreign countries seems to entail, in order\r\nthat peaceful measures may be taken in time to prevent a collision.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is a rough account of the actual work of diplomacy. It is not a\r\nfull account. There are many wrong things done which deserve criticism, but\r\nwhich we have not had space to mention. There is also much self-sacrificing\r\nand thankless work done by diplomatists and consuls in distant parts of the\r\nworld--much seeming drudgery which can hope for no reward--many honourable\r\nservices rendered to the public of which the public never hears. But the\r\nabove account will suffice to give a rough idea of the organisation with\r\nwhich we are dealing, and we may now pass on to consider the question of\r\nhow this organisation should be managed and controlled.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. THE DEMOCRATISATION OF FOREIGN POLICY\r\n\r\nThis phrase is rapidly becoming a political catchword. As such it requires\r\nto be approached with the utmost caution. Before going further it is\r\nnecessary to test the assumptions underlying it and to inquire how far they\r\nreally correspond to the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. _Democracy and Peace._--First of all, the main assumption made by\r\nEnglishmen who advocate the democratisation of foreign policy is that\r\ninternational peace would thereby be assured. True, the extension of the\r\ndemocratic principle is to many men an end in itself, quite apart from the\r\nquestion whether it tends to peace. But great masses of men are not moved\r\nto make political demands merely by theoretical considerations; it is the\r\npressure of definite and imminent evils which arouses them to action. In\r\nthe case of England the demand for greater democratic control in the sphere\r\nof foreign policy arose in large measure from the sudden realisation, in\r\nthe late summer of 1911, at the time of the so-called Agadir crisis, that\r\nwar between this country and Germany was a possibility with which English\r\nstatesmen and the English people had to reckon. We had felt the breath\r\nof war actually on our cheek, and a large section of English sentiment\r\nrevolted from it. A demand was raised for a democratic policy of peace.\r\nThree years later, on August 3, 1914, when Parliament met to decide the\r\nhappiness or sufferings of the quarter of the human race comprised in the\r\nBritish Empire, the same demand was voiced in a series of speeches which\r\naccurately expressed the belief that peace was the policy of the people,\r\nwhile war was the secret aim of their rulers. Mr. T. Edmund Harvey, M.P.,\r\nspoke as follows:\r\n\r\n\"I am convinced that this war, for the great masses of the countries of\r\nEurope, and not for our own country alone, is no people's war. It is a war\r\nthat has been made ... by men in high places, by diplomatists working in\r\nsecret, by bureaucrats who are out of touch with the peoples of the world,\r\nwho are the remnant of an older evil civilisation which is disappearing by\r\ngradual and peaceful methods.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ponsonby, M.P., spoke in the same sense:\r\n\r\n\"I trust that, even though it may be late, the Foreign Secretary will use\r\nevery endeavour to the very last moment, disregarding the tone of messages\r\nand the manner of Ambassadors, but looking to the great central interests\r\nof humanity and civilisation to keep this country in a state of peace.\"\r\n\r\nDemocracy means peace;--can we accept this assumption? Contrasts are\r\nsometimes illuminating, and it may be well to turn from the Parliamentary\r\ndebate of August 3 to an article written sixty-two years ago in an English\r\nreview by the greatest democrat of his time. In April 1852 Mazzini\r\npublished in the _Westminster Review_ an appeal to England to intervene on\r\nthe Continent in favour of the revolutionary movements in progress there\r\nsince 1848. The following is an extract from that article:\r\n\r\n\"The menace of the foreigner weighs upon the smaller States; the last\r\nsparks of European liberty are extinguished under the dictatorial veto of\r\nthe retrograde powers. England--the country of Elizabeth and Cromwell--has\r\nnot a word to say in favour of the principle to which she owes her\r\nexistence. If England persist in maintaining this neutral, passive, selfish\r\npart, she will have to expiate it. A European transformation is inevitable.\r\nWhen it shall take place, when the struggle shall burst forth at twenty\r\nplaces at once, when the old combat between fact and right is decided,\r\nthe peoples will remember that England had stood by, an inert, immovable,\r\nsceptical witness of their sufferings and efforts.... England will find\r\nherself some day a third-rate power, and to this she is being brought by a\r\nwant of foresight in her statesmen. The nation must rouse herself and shake\r\noff the torpor of her Government.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ponsonby appealing in the name of the people to Sir Edward Grey to\r\nstand aloof from European war; Mazzini appealing in the name of the people\r\nto the respectable, peaceable, middle classes of England to forsake\r\nCobden's pacifist doctrines and throw England's sword into the scale of\r\nEuropean revolution--it is a strange contrast which serves to remind us\r\nthat the word \"democracy,\" so lightly bandied about by political parties,\r\nhas many different meanings and has stood for many different policies. It\r\nmay be roughly said that it stood for internationalism in 1792, when France\r\nclaimed as her mission the liberation of all nations under the tricolor;\r\nit stood for nationalism in 1848 in the mouth of Mazzini, Kossuth and the\r\nGerman constitutional party; to-day it again stands for internationalism\r\nin the more advanced countries of Europe, but are we justified as yet in\r\ncalling this more than a phase in the development of democratic doctrine?\r\nIt is a very difficult question, which it would be presumptuous to try to\r\nanswer offhand; all we have tried to show here is that, on the whole, the\r\nassumption as to the peaceful tendencies of a democratic foreign policy is\r\na doubtful one, on which we must to some extent reserve our judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n§2. _Foreign Policy and Popular Forces._--The above considerations will\r\nhelp us to appreciate at its true value the second main assumption which\r\nlies behind the demand for increased democratic control of foreign\r\npolicy--namely, the assumption that the stuff of international politics\r\nis at present spun from the designs of individual statesmen, and has no\r\nrelation to the needs of the peoples they govern. Stated thus, this idea\r\nwill not bear examination for a moment. The doctrine of the \"economic\r\ninterpretation of history,\" which has received perhaps its most emphatic\r\nexpression in the teaching of Marxian socialists, is now in one form or\r\nanother accepted by all thinking men. But \"economics\" is after all a rough\r\nname for the sum of the ordinary needs and efforts of every single human\r\nbeing, and the economic interpretation of history means that the history of\r\nthe world is in the long run determined by the cumulative force of these\r\nhumble needs and efforts. This and this alone is the real stuff of\r\ninternational politics. Statesmen may attempt to found systems, but the\r\nonly real force in international as in domestic politics is the education\r\nof the individual man's desires. It is indeed open to any critic to say\r\nthat our present capitalist economic system is responsible for war because\r\nit dams up and diverts from their true channels the needs and the efforts\r\nof the mass of mankind. But to this an Englishman may fairly answer that\r\nthe free trade system under which our capitalist organisation has reached\r\nits greatest development was built up by the Manchester School with the\r\nsincere and avowed object of introducing universal peace. Cobden avowed\r\nthis object clearly:\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" he said, \"in free trade that which shall act on the moral world\r\nas the law of gravitation in the universe, drawing men together, thrusting\r\naside the antagonism of race and creed and language and uniting us in the\r\nbonds of eternal peace... I believe that the desire and motive for large\r\nand mighty empires, for gigantic armies and mighty navies ... will die\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\nYet, in spite of these aspirations, great wars have come to England,\r\nnot once, but at least three times, since these words were spoken, and\r\narmaments are immeasurably larger than ever before.\r\n\r\nLet us understand one thing clearly in connection with the present war. Mr.\r\nPonsonby, in the words already quoted, implored Sir E. Grey to \"look to the\r\ngreat central interests of humanity and civilisation,\" and to preserve the\r\nneutrality of England in those interests. But at the moment at which he\r\nspoke the eyes of English statesmen were looking at one thing alone. It was\r\nnot a question of what French statesmen expected them to do. The British\r\nGovernment had explained quite clearly to French statesmen that they must\r\nnot expect armed support from England. This fact had been made clear to the\r\nFrench Foreign Office long before in a series of conversations between the\r\nstatesmen, and it had been embodied in a letter from Sir E. Grey to the\r\nFrench Ambassador. But when the shadow of war actually fell on France these\r\nconversations and this letter faded into the background. It was no longer a\r\nquestion of what the French President expected from the King of England. It\r\nwas a question of what Jacques Roturier, artisan in the streets of Paris,\r\nknowing that the Germans were on the frontier and might be dropping their\r\nshells into Paris in a fortnight, expected from John Smith, shopkeeper in\r\nthe East India Dock Road, London, safe behind the English Channel from all\r\nthe horrors of war. That was, not rhetorically but in all soberness of\r\nfact, the real \"international obligation\" on August 3, 1914; for though\r\ntreaties are made by statesmen they are in the long run interpreted, not\r\nby statesmen, but by the public opinion which becomes slowly centred on\r\nthem--by the hopes and fears of millions of working men and women who have\r\nnever read the terms of the treaty but to whom it has become the symbol of\r\na friendship on which they can draw in case of need. The magistrate may\r\nwrite the marriage lines, but the marriage becomes what the husband and\r\nwife make it--a thing far deeper and more binding than any legal contract.\r\n\r\nIn the light of these considerations, we can establish one point of supreme\r\nimportance in dealing with foreign policy--namely, that the causes of war\r\nare very different from the immediate occasions of war. When the British\r\nGovernment, at the outbreak of the present war, published a White Paper\r\ncontaining the diplomatic correspondence between July 20 and August 4,\r\n1914, they were publishing evidence as to the immediate occasion of\r\nwar--namely the Austrian ultimatum of July 23 to Serbia which brought on\r\nthe war. In the twelve days which intervened between the delivery of that\r\nultimatum and the declaration of war between England and Germany, the\r\nnegotiations on which hung the immediate fate of Europe were, it is true,\r\nconducted by a few leading statesmen. But it is of little use to argue\r\nwhether or not these negotiations were conducted ill or well, for they were\r\nnot the real _cause_ of the war. The cause of the war must be sought in the\r\nslow development of forces which can be traced back for years, and even for\r\ncenturies. It was comparatively futile for Parliament to discuss whether\r\nthis or that despatch or telegram was wise or unwise; the real questions to\r\nbe asked were--What produced the crowds in Vienna surging round the Serbian\r\nLegation at the end of June, and round the Russian Embassy at the end of\r\nJuly; what produced the slow, patient sympathy for the Balkan peoples and\r\nhatred for Austria in the heart of millions of Russian peasants; what\r\nproduced the Servian nationalist movement; above all, what produced that\r\nstrange sentiment throughout Germany which could honestly regard the\r\ninvasion of Belgium as justifiable? To answer those questions we have to\r\nestimate the force of the most heterogeneous factors in history:--for\r\ninstance, on the one hand, the slow break-up of the Turkish Empire,\r\nextending over more than two centuries, which has allowed the cauldron of\r\nthe Slavonic Balkan peoples to boil up through the thin crust of foreign\r\ndomination; and on the other hand, the gradual development of the whole\r\nsystem of German State education, and the character of the German\r\nnewspapers, which have turned the eyes of German public opinion in upon\r\nitself and have excluded from public teaching and from the formation of\r\nthought every breath of fresh air from the outside world, until at last\r\nGerman public sentiment, through extreme and incessant self-contemplation,\r\nhas lost the calmness and simplicity which were once the strength of the\r\nGerman character. No man can allot the responsibility for these things,\r\nspreading as they do over generations; but assuredly the responsibility\r\ndoes not rest with the half-dozen Ministers for Foreign Affairs who were in\r\npower in July 1914.\r\n\r\nIf we are right in what we have said above, then the phrase \"the\r\ndemocratization of foreign policy\" takes on a new meaning. It does not\r\nmean merely the introduction into foreign policy of any set of democratic\r\ninstitutions; it means the realisation by both statesmen and people that\r\nforeign policy is already in its essence a fundamentally democratic thing,\r\nand that the success or failure of any line of action depends not upon the\r\ndesires of politicians but upon the mighty forces which move and determine\r\nthe life of peoples.\r\n\r\nAt present the statesmen do not realise this sufficiently, and hence comes\r\nmuch futile and aimless talking and writing among politicians who fancy\r\nthat what they say or write to each other in their studies can determine\r\nthe course of the world. In order to enable diplomatists to discharge all\r\nthe duties we have already enumerated under the heading of \"the estimation\r\nof national forces,\" they need to have a better training and a fuller\r\nknowledge of the life and social movements both of their own country and\r\nof foreign countries. The Royal Commission on the Civil Service was still\r\nconsidering, when war broke out, how this could be accomplished. It is too\r\nlong a question to enter on here, but it may safely be said that the more\r\nthe problem is examined the more does it appear to be, like the wider\r\nproblem of the whole body of 200,000 civil servants in the United Kingdom,\r\na question of national education, and not a mere matter of Government\r\nregulations and democratic institutions. What is required, in the Foreign\r\nOffice, as in the whole British civil service, has been well expressed by\r\nMr. Graham Wallas in his book _Human Nature in Politics_:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"However able our officials are and however varied their origin, the danger\r\nof the narrowness and rigidity which has hitherto so generally resulted\r\nfrom official life would still remain and must be guarded against by every\r\nkind of encouragement to free intellectual development.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§3. _Foreign Policy and Education_.--But if statesmen do not sufficiently\r\nrealise the strength of existing popular forces in foreign policy, it is\r\nequally true that the people themselves do not realise it. The people of\r\nevery country are inclined to think that they can alter the destiny of\r\nnations by ousting one foreign minister from power and setting up another;\r\nthey think that speeches and the resolutions passed by congresses can\r\nchange fundamental economic facts. They think that mere expressions of\r\nmutual goodwill can take the place of knowledge, and they forget that no\r\nnation can shake itself free in a moment from the historical development\r\nwhich has formed it, just as no man can wholly shake himself free from\r\nthe character which he has inherited from his ancestors. Indeed all our\r\nphrases--our whole attitude of mind--shows how little we, as a people,\r\nrealise popular forces. We commonly speak, for instance, of Russia as if\r\nnothing in that vast country had any influence on foreign affairs except\r\nthe opinions of a few bureaucrats in Petrograd. Our sympathy for\r\nor hostility to Russia is determined by our opinion of the Russian\r\nbureaucracy, and we never spare a thought for the hopes and fears and the\r\ndumb but ardent beliefs of millions of Russian peasants. We are apt to\r\ndismiss them from our minds as ignorant and superstitious villagers\r\ntyrannised over by the Tsar, without troubling to enquire narrowly into the\r\nreal facts of Russian life. We thus make precisely the same mistake that\r\ndiplomatists too often make. We forget that the masses of peasants who flow\r\nevery year on pilgrimage to the shrines of their religion constitute a more\r\nvital fact in the history of the world than the deliberations of the Duma\r\nor the decisions of police magistrates.\r\n\r\nHere we have a lesson to learn from Germany, for German statesmen,\r\nstrangely enough, have taken immense trouble to make their policy a\r\ndemocratic one. The whole German nation is behind them because for\r\nyears and years they have taught the nation through the schools, the\r\nuniversities, and the press, their own reading of history and their own\r\nidea of what true civilisation is. They have adapted their teaching to the\r\nfundamental characteristics and to the history of the German people. They\r\nhave taken pains to ally the interests alike of capital and labour to their\r\npolicy, and to fuse the whole nation by a uniform national education and by\r\na series of paternal social reforms imposed from above. The real strength\r\nand danger of Germany is not what her statesmen or soldiers _do_, but what\r\nGermans themselves _believe_. We are fighting not an army but a false idea;\r\nand nothing will defeat a false idea but the knowledge of the truth.\r\n\r\nWhen this war is over, whatever its outcome may be, we must try to\r\nintroduce a new era into the history of the world. But our fathers and our\r\nfathers' fathers have tried to do this same thing, and we shall not succeed\r\nif we go about the work in a spirit of self-sufficiency and hasty pride.\r\nOnly knowledge of the truth will enable us to succeed. Knowledge of the\r\ntruth is not an easy thing; it is a question of laborious thought, mental\r\ndiscipline, the humility which is content to learn and the moral courage\r\nwhich can face the truth when it is learnt. How are we to gain these\r\nthings?\r\n\r\nFirst of all, by schools, universities, classes--all the machinery of our\r\nnational and private education.\r\n\r\nThen, by the same means as popular government employs in other matters--by\r\ndiscussion, by debates in Parliament, by criticism of the Government. Now,\r\nthese means are not employed at present partly because it is feared that\r\ncriticism of the Government in matters of foreign policy will weaken its\r\nhands in dealing with foreign nations. This is a just fear if criticism\r\nmerely springs from the critics' personal likings or prejudices, but\r\nno such evil effects need be feared if the criticism springs from deep\r\nthought, from knowledge of the facts and from the patience and wisdom\r\nwhich thought and knowledge bring. But partly also effective discussion\r\nof foreign politics does not exist because we are more interested in home\r\npolitics. We really have, if we cared to use it, as much democratic control\r\nover the Foreign Office under our constitution as over any Government\r\nDepartment, for the Foreign Office, like every other Department, is under\r\nthe control of a member of Parliament, elected by the people. But we\r\nare more interested in social reform, in labour legislation, and in\r\nconstitutional reform than in foreign politics; and so it is on questions\r\nof home policy that we make and unmake Governments, and when we discuss\r\nwhether a Conservative or a Liberal Government ought to be in power, we\r\nnever think what effect the change would have on foreign policy. If the\r\ndemocracy is to take a real part in foreign politics, it must recognise\r\nthat great responsibilities mean great sacrifices. We must be content to\r\nthink a little less of our internal social reform, and give more of our\r\nattention to the very difficult questions which arise beyond the Channel\r\nand beyond the Atlantic Ocean. We must live constantly in the consciousness\r\nthat the world to-day is one community, and that in everything we do as\r\na people we bear a responsibility not to ourselves alone but to the\r\npopulation of the British Empire as a whole and to the family of nations.\r\n\r\nBut when we have really set ourselves to understand and discharge the\r\nresponsibilities of foreign policy, how shall we, the people of this\r\ncountry, make our opinions effective? How can we be sure that the Foreign\r\nOffice will carry out a policy corresponding to the considered convictions\r\nwhich we as a people have formed?\r\n\r\nAs already stated, we have in our hands the same means of Parliamentary\r\ncontrol over foreign policy as over internal policy. Parliament can\r\noverthrow a Government whose policy it disapproves, and it can refuse to\r\ngrant supplies for the carrying out of such a policy. Short of this, the\r\npeople can express through Parliament its views as to the way in which\r\nforeign policy should be conducted, and generally Ministers will bow, in\r\nthis as in other matters, to the clearly expressed views of Parliament. We\r\nhave, in fact, recently seen a striking example of this. When after the\r\ninternational crisis of 1911 the country clearly expressed the opinion that\r\nno secret engagements should be entered into with any Power which would\r\nforce Great Britain to go to war in support of that Power, the Prime\r\nMinister stated, and has repeated his statement emphatically on several\r\nsubsequent occasions, that the Government of this country neither had\r\nentered, nor would enter, into any such secret engagements, and that any\r\ntreaty entailing warlike obligations on this country would be laid before\r\nParliament. This has now become a fixed and recognised fact in British\r\npolicy, and it is not too much to say that, like other constitutional\r\nchanges under the British system of government, it is rapidly becoming a\r\npart of the unwritten constitution of the country.\r\n\r\nBut many people would like to go beyond this, and lay down that no treaty\r\nbetween Great Britain and another country shall be valid until it has been\r\nvoted by Parliament. Many countries have provisions of this kind in their\r\nconstitutions; for instance, the constitution of the United States provides\r\nthat all treaties must be ratified by a two-thirds majority of the Senate,\r\nand the French constitution contains the following provision:\r\n\r\n\"The President of the Republic negotiates and ratifies treaties. He brings\r\nthem to the knowledge of the Chamber so soon as the interests and the\r\nsafety of the State permit.\r\n\r\n\"Treaties of peace and of commerce, treaties which impose a claim on the\r\nfinances of the State, those which relate to the personal status and\r\nproperty rights of French subjects abroad, do not become valid until they\r\nhave been voted by the two Chambers. No cession, exchange, or increase of\r\nterritory can take place except by virtue of a law.\"\r\n\r\nSuch constitutional provisions may be good in their way, and it may be\r\nthat we should copy them. But the question is one of secondary importance.\r\nWhether treaties must actually be ratified by Parliament, or merely laid\r\nbefore Parliament for an expression of its opinion, as is commonly done in\r\nthis country, the Parliament and people of Great Britain will have control\r\nover foreign policy just in the measure that they take a keen interest in\r\nit. If they take a keen interest no statesman dependent for his position\r\non the votes of the electorate will dare to embody in a treaty a policy of\r\nwhich they disapprove; while if they do not take an adequate interest,\r\nno amount of constitutional provisions will enable them to exercise an\r\nintelligent control over the actions of statesmen.\r\n\r\nThe same may be said of another expedient adopted in many countries;\r\nnamely, the appointment by Parliament of Committees on Foreign Affairs,\r\nwith power to call for papers and examine Ministers on their policy.\r\nDemocratic government both in foreign and internal affairs has hitherto\r\nrested on the idea that Parliament should have adequate control over the\r\nprinciples on which policy is conducted, but must to a large extent leave\r\nthe details of administration to the executive departments which are\r\ncontrolled by the Ministers of the Crown. Parliament, whether through\r\ncommittees or otherwise, will never be able to follow or control all\r\ndiplomatic negotiations, any more than it can control all the details\r\nof the administration necessary to carry out a complicated law like the\r\nInsurance Act; and Committees of Parliament, however useful, will have\r\nno influence unless the people of the country so recognise their\r\nresponsibilities in foreign politics that they will demand from the men\r\nwhom they elect to Parliament a judgment and a knowledge of foreign\r\naffairs, at least as sound and well based as they now require in the case\r\nof internal affairs.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this imposes a very difficult task on the British\r\nelectorate. How are they to weigh foreign affairs and internal affairs\r\nagainst each other? What are they to do if they approve the internal policy\r\nof a Government, but disapprove of its foreign policy, or _vice versa_? Are\r\nwe, for instance, to sacrifice what we believe to be our duty in foreign\r\naffairs in order that we may keep in power a Government which is carrying\r\nout what we believe to be a sound policy of internal social reform? It\r\nis here, it would seem, that some reform is really needed. There is one\r\nsolution: namely, to separate the control of domestic affairs on the one\r\nhand and foreign affairs on the other, placing domestic affairs in the\r\nhands of a Parliament and and a Cabinet who will stand or fall by their\r\ninternal policy alone, and entrusting foreign affairs to an Imperial\r\nParliament and an Imperial Cabinet formed of representatives not of Great\r\nBritain alone but of the whole British Empire. This is an idea which merits\r\nthe most careful consideration by the people of the United Kingdom, for it\r\nmay well be doubted whether any real popular control of foreign policy is\r\npossible until some such division of functions takes place. One word in\r\nconclusion. If it is true that domestic policy and foreign policy are\r\nseparate functions of Government, it is also true that the domestic policy\r\nof a country in the long run determines its foreign policy. International\r\npeace can never be attained between nations torn with internal dissensions;\r\ninternational justice will remain a dream so long as political parties and\r\nschools of thought dispute over the meaning of justice in domestic\r\naffairs. A true ideal of peace must embrace the class struggle as well as\r\ninternational war. If we desire a \"Concert of Europe\" which shall be based\r\non true freedom and not on tyranny, it behoves us to realise our ideal\r\nfirst in England, and to raise our country itself above the political and\r\nsocial conflicts and hatreds which have formed so large and so sordid a\r\npart of our domestic history for the last decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to give a list of books illustrating foreign policy in\r\ngeneral. The lists given in other chapters sufficiently illustrate the\r\nvarious problems with which foreign policy to-day has to deal.\r\n\r\nThe diplomacy of a century ago is well illustrated by the _Diaries and\r\nCorrespondence of the Earl of Malmesbury_. 4 vols. 1844. (Out of print.)\r\nFor the diplomacy of the middle of the nineteenth century, when the present\r\nnational forces of Europe were being created, the following biographies are\r\nuseful:\r\n\r\n_Life of Lord Stratford de Redcliffe_, by Lane-Poole. 2 vols. 1888.\r\n\r\n_Life of Lord Granville_, by Lord Fitzmaurice. 2 vols. 1905.\r\n\r\n_Life of Lord Clarendon_, by Sir Herbert Maxwell. 2 vols. 1913.\r\n\r\n_Life of Lord Lyons_, by Lord Newton. 2 vols. 1898.\r\n\r\n_Life of Cavour_, by Roscoe Thayer. 2 vols. 1911.\r\n\r\n_Bismarck's Reflections_.\r\n\r\nThere are many studies of the diplomatic problems of the present day, but\r\nas they deal with history in the making they are to be read for the general\r\nsurvey they give of forces at work rather than as authoritative statements.\r\nA very comprehensive survey of all the complexities of international\r\npolitics will be found in Fullerton's _Problems of Power_ (1913). 7s. 6d.\r\nnet.\r\n\r\nThe actual workings of diplomacy may best be seen in the \"White Books\" of\r\ndiplomatic correspondence, periodically published by the Foreign Office,\r\nsuch, for instance, as the successive volumes of _Correspondence Respecting\r\nthe Affairs of Persia_. Perhaps the best idea of the actual labour of\r\nforeign relations can be gained by consulting such compilations as\r\nHertslet's _Commercial Treaties_--23 vols. 1827-1905--which are a record of\r\nwork actually completed.\r\n\r\nOn the staffing of the Foreign Office and the Diplomatic Service, see the\r\nfifth Report of the Royal Commission on the Civil Service (Cd. 7748), just\r\npublished (5-1/2 d.).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE ISSUES OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n\"March ahead of the ideas of your age, and it will follow you: go\r\nwith them, and you can feel at ease: remain behind them, and you are\r\nlost.\"--NAPOLEON III.\r\n\r\n\r\n§1. _Is there an Idea behind the War?_--The object of the preceding\r\nchapters has been to provide the historic background without which it is\r\nimpossible to understand either the motives of our opponents or the events\r\nwhich led up to their quarrel. It is now necessary to attempt a survey of\r\nthe issues raised by the war, both as concerns Europe as a whole and the\r\nindividual nations which form its component parts. This is a task of no\r\nsmall difficulty, for just as it is true to say that no war in the previous\r\nhistory of mankind has ever been waged on so huge a scale as this, so it is\r\nalso true to say that the issues raised by it are vaster and more varied\r\nthan those of any previous European conflict. It is as though by the\r\npressure of an electric button some giant sluice had been opened,\r\nunchaining forces over which mortal men can hardly hope to recover control\r\nand whose action it is wellnigh impossible to foresee.\r\n\r\nYet complex as is the problem before us, it is essential that we should\r\nface it bravely. There is grave danger lest, just as we have been \"rushed\r\ninto\" this war (through no fault of ours, as the diplomatic correspondence\r\nabundantly proves), so we may at a given moment be \"rushed out\" of it,\r\nwithout having reached any very clear idea as to what issues are involved,\r\nand how far our vital interests have been affected.\r\n\r\nThe essence of the problem before us is to discover whether there is an\r\nIdea behind this war--whether on our own side or on that of the enemy. A\r\ndangerous question, this!--a question posed again and again by the jingoes\r\nand the fanatics of history, and invariably answered according to the\r\ndictates of their own convenience. And yet a question which we dare not\r\nshirk, a question which a Carlyle, a Ruskin, a William Morris would not\r\nhave hesitated to formulate. Does Britain stand for an Idea? Is it true\r\nthat we are fighting in the main for the cause of Liberty and Democracy,\r\nfor progress in Europe and the world at large? And if this be really true\r\nto-day, how can we best ensure that it shall still be true at the close\r\nof this long war, if, as we hope and pray, victory crowns the arms of\r\nthe Allies? It was an Idea that nerved Britain for the struggle against\r\nNapoleon. It was an Idea that inspired Germany in the great uprising of\r\n1813 against Napoleon. It was an Idea that brought the Balkan League\r\ninto being and carried its armies in triumph to Salonica and Adrianople.\r\nFreedom, Unity, Liberation, such were the forms which that Idea took: the\r\ndetermination of a free people to resist an upstart despot's designs\r\nof world-dominion; the enthusiasm of a divided nation for the dream of\r\nnational unity; the longing of races which had but recently won their own\r\nfreedom, to emancipate their kinsmen from an alien and oppressive yoke.\r\nIn each of these struggles error and even crimes were committed by the\r\nvictors, and yet it is a thousand times true to assert that the victorious\r\nIdea represented in each case the triumph of civilisation. To-day the\r\nposition is equally clear. In opposing Germany's claim to override\r\ninternational treaty obligations to suit the convenience of her military\r\nstrategists, in associating ourselves with Belgium and Serbia in their\r\nvindication of the rights of the smaller nations, we are not merely\r\nresisting a fresh bid for world-dominion on the part of a single power, but\r\nare challenging the theory that Might is superior to Right in the political\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n§2. _The Aims of British Statesmanship._--Mr. Asquith on September 19\r\ndefined as follows the three main aims of British statesmanship in entering\r\nupon war: \"(1) To vindicate the sanctity of treaty obligations and what is\r\nproperly called the public law of Europe, (2) to assert and to enforce\r\nthe independence of free States, relatively small and weak, against the\r\nencroachments and the violence of the strong, and (3) to withstand, as\r\nwe believe in the best interests not only of our own Empire, but of\r\ncivilisation at large, the arrogant claim of a single Power to dominate the\r\ndevelopment of the destinies of Europe.\" In speaking thus, Mr. Asquith had\r\nno intention of placing Britain upon a moral pedestal or of suggesting that\r\nwe have ever enjoyed a monopoly of political right dealing. Every nation\r\nhas blots upon its scutcheon; and the cynic may point to the Irish Union,\r\nthe destruction of the Danish fleet, the Cyprus Convention, as proofs that\r\nwe have richly earned the name of \"Perfidious Albion.\" Let us forego the\r\npatriotic retort which would fling in Prussia's teeth such incidents as the\r\nconquest of Silesia, the partition of Poland, the Ems telegram, the seizure\r\nof Kiaochau. But let us, while admitting our shortcomings in the past, nail\r\nour colours to the mast and insist that this war shall never degenerate\r\ninto one of mere revenge or aggrandisement, that the fate of the nations of\r\nEurope shall be decided, so far as possible, in accordance with their own\r\naspirations rather than the territorial ambitions of dynasties or racial\r\ncliques.\r\n\r\nIs it, then, possible, when considering the lines of settlement, to lay\r\ndown any general principles? The Europe which we have known has gone\r\nbeyond recall; the new Europe which is coming to birth will be scarcely\r\nrecognisable to those who have known its predecessor. Its political,\r\nracial, social, economic outlook will be radically changed. Let us then\r\nmeet fate halfway and admit boldly that we _want_ a new Europe. But let us\r\nbear in mind the fiery process by which a huge bell is forged and the fate\r\nwhich befell the impatient apprentice who opened the furnace doors too\r\nsoon. The Prussian leaders, to whom war is an ideal and a programme, are\r\nentitled, if fortune should desert them, to manoeuvre for a \"draw\"; for\r\nthey would console themselves with the hope of winning a subsequent match.\r\nBut to us, who regard war as a hateful necessity, from which we do not\r\nshrink, but which we did everything in our power to avert--to us there\r\ncan be no thought of relinquishing our task, until there is a reasonable\r\nprospect of a really lasting settlement. We should need no prompting from\r\nour statesmen to realise that this must be \"a fight to a finish.\" There\r\nmust be no reversion to the _status quo_, that accursed device of a\r\nworn-out diplomacy, with its inevitable seeds of new quarrels and yet\r\nanother Armageddon.\r\n\r\nPublic Law, Nationality, and a general reduction of armaments (as\r\ndistinguished from complete disarmament) are the three foundation stones\r\nof the new era, as already envisaged in the public utterances of those who\r\nhave some right to speak for the Triple Entente. Let us then endeavour to\r\napply these principles to the various problems raised by the war. It is\r\nobvious that their application depends upon the victory of the Allies. If\r\nwe are defeated, public law will have lost its value, for the Germans will\r\nhave asserted their right to violate its fundamental provisions. The idea\r\nof Nationality will have received its death-blow; for not only will the\r\nindependence of several of the smaller nations have been destroyed,\r\nbut Germany will have reasserted her right to dominate her own minor\r\nnationalities, and to drain the life-blood of the 26 million Slavs of\r\nAustria-Hungary in a conflict with their own Slavonic kinsmen. Finally,\r\nall hope of reduced armaments will have been exploded, since the theory of\r\nBlood and Iron will have attained its fullest expression in the virtual\r\ndomination of a single power on land and sea. Regrets or misgivings we may\r\nhave, but the time for their utterance has long since passed. The British\r\nnation must have no illusions; defeat means the downfall of the Empire, and\r\nthe reduction of Britain to the position of a second-rate power. Either we\r\nshall emerge victorious, or for all practical purposes we shall not emerge\r\nat all. Even if _we_ shrink from a \"fight to a finish,\" our enemies can be\r\nrelied upon to persist to the bitter end. It is for this reason only, and\r\nnot because I underestimate for a moment the vast resources, the splendid\r\norganisation, the military valour of Germany, that I restrict myself in\r\nthe following pages to a consideration of the possible effects of victory\r\nrather than of defeat. It would be the height of folly to anticipate\r\nvictory before it is achieved; but it is essential that we should be\r\nprepared for all possible contingencies, and this involves a careful survey\r\nof the various factors in an extraordinarily complicated situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n§3. _Britain and Germany._--In the forefront of the discussion stands our\r\nquarrel with Germany. What are to be our future relations with Germany\r\nafter the war? If there is anything in the assertion that we are fighting\r\nfor the cause of liberty and progress, it can only mean that we are\r\nfighting a system rather than a nation--Prussian militarism and\r\nbureaucracy, but not German civilisation. We have to go still further and\r\nconsider the motive powers behind that iron system. Sitting in our little\r\nisland, we are apt to forget what it means to possess a purely artificial\r\nfrontier of 400 miles, and to see just beyond it a neighbour numbering\r\n171,000,000 inhabitants, in an earlier stage of civilisation and capable of\r\nbeing set in motion by causes which no longer operate in the western world.\r\n\r\nIf the final settlement is to be just and lasting, the demands of the\r\nvictors must be adjusted to the minimum, not the maximum, of their own\r\nvital interests. For Britain the central problem must inevitably be: What\r\nis to be the position of the German Navy if we are successful in this war?\r\nIs anything even remotely resembling disarmament to be attained unless that\r\nNavy is rendered innocuous? Is it conceivable that even if Britain accepted\r\nthe _status quo_, a victorious Russia could ever tolerate a situation which\r\nsecured to Germany the naval supremacy of the Baltic, and the possibility\r\nof bottling Russian sea-trade? Even the opening months of the war have\r\nshown what ought always to have been obvious, that sea-power differs from\r\nland-power in one vital respect: military supremacy can be shared between\r\nseveral powerful States, but naval supremacy is one and indivisible. In\r\nthis war we shall either maintain and reassert our command of the sea, or\r\nwe shall lose it: share it with Germany we shall not, because we cannot.\r\n\r\nAgain, what is to be the fate of German shipping and German colonies? Can\r\nwe not curtail Germany's war navy, while respecting her mercantile marine?\r\nIs it either expedient or necessary to exact the uttermost farthing in the\r\ncolonial sphere in the event of victory? It is obvious that just as Germany\r\noffered to respect French territory in Europe at the expense of the French\r\ncolonial empire, so the Allies, if victorious, might divide the German\r\ncolonies between them. By so doing, however, we shall provide, in the eyes\r\nof the German nation, a complete justification of William II.'s naval\r\npolicy. One of the most widespread arguments among educated Germans\r\n(including those friendly to this country) has always been that German\r\ncolonies and shipping are at the mercy of a stronger sea-power, and that\r\ntherefore Germany only holds her sea-trade on sufferance. If, as a result\r\nof the war, we take from her all that we can, we shall ingrain this\r\npoint of view in every German. We should thus tend to perpetuate the old\r\nsituation, with its intolerable competition of armaments, unless indeed\r\nwe could reduce Germany to complete bankruptcy--a thing which is almost\r\ninconceivable to those who know her resources and which would deprive us of\r\none of our most valuable customers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we must of course remember that any extra-European\r\nterritorial changes depend not merely upon the attitude of Britain and her\r\nAllies, but upon the wishes of the Dominions. Even in the event of victory,\r\nit is still not London alone that will decide the fate of New Guinea, of\r\nSamoa, or of German South-West Africa. The last word will probably be\r\nspoken by Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa, and it is improbable\r\nthat any one of the three will consent to the restoration of territory\r\nwhich they have occupied. It is only in the case of German colonies which\r\nborder upon British Crown colonies _(e.g._ Togoland, Cameroon, or East\r\nAfrica) that the decision will rest entirely with the European governments.\r\nAt this stage it would be absurd to suggest even the bare outlines of a\r\nsettlement; but it is well to emphasize the fact that it involves not only\r\nthe United Kingdom but the Dominions, and that on its solution depends the\r\nfuture development of the British Empire. In other words, the war can only\r\nresult in the downfall of the Empire or in the achievement of Imperial\r\nFederation and a further democratisation of the central government.\r\n\r\n\r\n§4. _Nationality and the German Empire._--Finally, there is a still graver\r\nquestion. Is Germany, if defeated, to lose territory _in Europe_? and if\r\nso, would it be either possible or expedient to compensate her in other\r\ndirections for such a loss? The application of the principle of\r\nNationality to the German Empire would affect its territory in three\r\ndirections--Alsace-Lorraine, Schleswig-Holstein, and Posen. Let us very\r\nbriefly consider these three problems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRANCO-GERMAN FRONTIER _Boundary of France 1815-1871_\r\nand _Boundary of France 1871-1914_]\r\n\r\n(1) The population of the two provinces of Alsace and Lorraine is mainly\r\nGerman by race and language, but none the less it had become by 1870 almost\r\nentirely French in feeling, as the result of its long union with France.\r\nThe Germans, in reannexing the provinces after the war, were actuated\r\nalmost equally by reasons of sentiment and strategy. They welcomed the\r\nrecovery of a section of their race which had been wrested from them by the\r\nbrutal aggression of Louis XIV. and the dynastic policy of his successor;\r\nthey also desired to secure their western frontier against the possible\r\nattacks of France, which, under the Third Empire, was still most\r\nemphatically an aggressive power. In drawing the new frontier they included\r\nfor purely strategic reasons a small portion of western Lorraine, round the\r\nfortress of Metz, which was admittedly as French as Champagne or Picardy.\r\nFrom 1871 till 1911, Alsace-Lorraine was governed as a direct appanage of\r\nthe Imperial Crown; in the latter year it received a constitution,\r\nbut nothing even remotely resembling self-government. Contrary to the\r\nexpectation of most Germans, the two provinces have not become German in\r\nsentiment; indeed the unconciliatory methods of Prussia have steadily\r\nincreased their estrangement, despite their share in the commercial\r\nprosperity of the Empire. Those who know intimately the undercurrents of\r\nfeeling in Alsace-Lorraine are unanimous in asserting that if before last\r\nJuly an impartial plebiscite, without fear of the consequences, could have\r\nbeen taken among the inhabitants, an overwhelming majority would have voted\r\nfor reunion with France. But having once been the battleground of the two\r\nnations and living in permanent dread of a repetition of the tragedy, the\r\nleaders of political thought in Alsace and Lorraine favoured a less drastic\r\nsolution. They knew that Germany would not relinquish her hold nor France\r\nrenounce her aspirations without another armed struggle; but they believed\r\nthat the grant of real autonomy within the Empire, such as would place them\r\non an equal footing with Würtemberg or Baden, would render their position\r\ntolerable, and by removing the chief source of friction between France\r\nand Germany, create the groundwork for more cordial and lasting relations\r\nbetween Germany and the two Western Powers.[1] Now that the nightmare of\r\nwar has once more fallen upon them, the situation has radically changed,\r\nand there can be no question that in the event of a French victory the\r\nprovinces would elect to return to France. The fact that several of their\r\nleading politicians have fled to France and identified themselves with the\r\nFrench cause, is symptomatic, though doubtless not conclusive. That the\r\ngovernment of the Republic, if victorious, will make the retrocession of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine its prime condition of peace, is as certain as anything can\r\nbe certain in the seething pot to which triumphant militarism has reduced\r\nunhappy Europe. It may, then, seem merely pedantic to refer to an\r\nalternative solution; and yet there is unquestionably a great deal to be\r\nsaid in favour of forming the two provinces into an independent State, or\r\nbetter still, uniting them in federal union with Luxemburg and Belgium.\r\nThus would be realised that \"Middle Kingdom\" which so many efforts have\r\nbeen made to create, from the days of Charlemagne onwards. Henceforward\r\nthe fate of Alsace-Lorraine would be neither French nor German; they would\r\nbecome a neutral clearing-house for the two cultures which have both come\r\nto be so inextricably bound up with the life and traditions of the border\r\nrace. At the same time the most fertile source of friction between France\r\nand Germany would be removed, and the two countries would no longer glare\r\nat each other across a frontier bristling with fortifications.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This ideal was being actively pursued by many thoughtful\r\npeople on both sides of the frontier. Only last June I was discussing it at\r\nsome length with a prominent Alsatian deputy and various other friends in\r\nBerlin.]\r\n\r\n(2) The problem of Schleswig-Holstein presents far less difficulty, if\r\ntreated on a basis of nationality. Much has been written about the enormity\r\nof Prussia's treatment of Denmark in 1848 and 1863; but the plain truth\r\nis that the great majority of the population of the two duchies was as\r\nenthusiastic in favour of union with their German kinsmen farther south, as\r\nthe population of Alsace-Lorraine was reluctant to be torn from France. The\r\nwhole of Holstein and much the greater part of Schleswig always was, and\r\nis, pure German by race. Unfortunately Prussia, in annexing territory\r\nwhich is as German as Kent is English, also acquired a portion of North\r\nSchleswig, which is as unquestionably Danish, alike by blood and by\r\nsentiment. Hence a complete revision of frontiers on a racial basis would\r\ncertainly involve the cession to Denmark of the extreme eastern portions of\r\nSchleswig, as far as and including the port of Flensburg.\r\n\r\nTo-day, however, this question is complicated by strategic considerations,\r\ndue to the creation of the Kiel Canal as an almost impregnable naval base.\r\nThe suggestion has already been seriously put forward, that Denmark should\r\nbe allowed, in the event of Germany's defeat, to extend her territory\r\nas far as the north bank of the Canal, which would thus become an\r\ninternational highway for peaceful commerce, possibly under a general\r\nguarantee of neutrality. Whether such a present might not prove a very\r\ngrave embarrassment to Denmark, and whether the guarantee would be more\r\neffectual than the treaty which secured Belgian independence, are questions\r\nwhich depend mainly upon the mood of the peoples of Europe after they are\r\ntired of shedding each other's blood. But it is well to realise that\r\nthe question of the Kiel Canal is one which may very possibly lead to a\r\nprolongation of the war, and which, as I have already hinted, Russia will\r\nnot allow to rest, even if Britain should hesitate to complete the work.\r\n\r\n(3) The third point at which, on a basis of racial redistribution, a\r\ndefeated Germany must inevitably suffer territorial loss, is the Polish\r\ndistrict on her eastern frontier. The present kingdom of Prussia includes\r\n3,328,750 Poles among its subjects, mainly in the former duchy of Posen,\r\nbut also in Silesia and along the southern edge of West and East Prussia\r\n(known as Mazurians and Kasubians). The pronouncedly anti-Polish policy\r\npursued by the German Government for over twenty years past has aroused\r\ndeep and insurmountable hatred against Prussia in the heart of the Poles,\r\nwho even in the days when Berlin was relatively conciliatory towards them\r\nhad never relinquished their passionate belief in the resurrection of their\r\ncountry. Above all, the attempt to denationalise the eastern marches by\r\nexpropriation, colonisation of Germans, and other still cruder methods,\r\nhas not only been in the main unsuccessful, but it has roused the Poles\r\nto formidable counter-efforts in the sphere of finance and agrarian\r\nco-operation. This coincided with remarkable changes in Russian Poland,\r\nwhich has rapidly become the chief industrial centre of the Russian Empire.\r\nEconomic causes have toned down the bitterness which Russia's cruel\r\nrepression of Polish aspirations had inspired, and to-day Prussia is\r\nunquestionably regarded by every Pole as a far more deadly enemy than even\r\nthe Russian autocracy, the more so as the conviction has steadily gained\r\nground that the Polish policy of Petrograd has been unduly subject to the\r\ndirections of Berlin. While, then, the Poles look upon the promises from\r\neither of these two capitals with pardonable suspicion and reserve, it\r\nis certain that to-day such hopes as they may entertain from foreign aid\r\ncentre more and more upon Russia.\r\n\r\nAny attempt to reconstruct the kingdom of Poland, whether as an independent\r\nState or, as seems more practicable, as an autonomous unit within the\r\nEmpire of the Tsar, would inevitably deprive Prussia of the greater part of\r\nthe Duchy of Posen (except the three or four western \"Kreise\" or districts,\r\nin which the German element predominates), a strip of eastern Silesia\r\nfrom the upper reaches of the Vistula northwards, and a further strip of\r\nterritory in East Prussia, extending from near the fortress of Thorn along\r\nthe Mazurian lakes (in fact, the scene of the opening battles of the\r\npresent war). Polish extremists, however, not content with these\r\nindubitably Polish districts, are already laying claim to the lower reaches\r\nof the Vistula and to Danzig as the port of the historical Poland; and\r\nthere is a further tendency in certain Russian circles to regard the whole\r\nprovince of East Prussia as part of the natural spoils of war. And yet it\r\nis obvious that the annexation of Danzig,[1] one of the bulwarks of the old\r\nHanseatic League, and of Königsberg, the cradle of the Prussian Crown\r\nand of modern German philosophy, would be a flagrant violation of that\r\nprinciple of Nationality which the Allies have inscribed upon their banner.\r\nThe province of which Königsberg is the capital is to-day, whatever it may\r\nhave been in the twelfth century, as German as any portion of the German\r\nEmpire. Moreover, it is the stronghold of Junkerdom, that arrogant but\r\nvirile squirearchy which still forms the backbone of the old Prussian\r\nsystem; and while it is doubtless the desire to undermine this caste\r\nby robbing it of hearth and home that prompts such drastic schemes of\r\nconquest, it cannot be too clearly realised that we should not only be\r\nguilty of a monstrous injustice in lending our support, but should\r\nbe sowing the seeds of a new and even thornier problem than that of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine. It would, moreover, be a superfluous injustice, since it\r\nis perfectly possible to create on broad racial lines a new frontier at\r\nleast as natural as that which divides Russia and Germany to-day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Strictly speaking, Danzig, though under Polish suzerainty till\r\n1772, has always been a German town enjoying complete autonomy. It shares\r\nthe fame of Hamburg and Lübeck as one of the greatest of the mediaeval\r\nHansa towns.]\r\n\r\nSuch are the changes which an application of the principle of Nationality\r\ninvolves. Let us then be under no illusions; they are changes such as can\r\nonly be extracted from a Germany which has virtually ceased to exist as a\r\nmilitary power--a contingency which is still remote to-day, and which can\r\nonly be attained by enormous sacrifices in blood and resources. It is only\r\nby readjustment and compensation in other directions that the German nation\r\ncould be induced even to consider a revision of frontier, and from the\r\nnature of things such compensation can only have one meaning--the break-up\r\nof Austria-Hungary.\r\n\r\n\r\n§5. _The Future of Austria-Hungary._--For many years this break-up has been\r\nforetold by political pessimists inside and outside the Habsburg dominions,\r\nand by many interested agitators both in Central and in Western Europe. The\r\npresent writer, on the other hand, has always regarded Austria-Hungary as\r\nan organism full of infinite possibilities of progress and culture, a State\r\nmodelled upon that diversity of type which Lord Acton held to be the\r\nsurest guarantee of liberty. Those who affected to treat it as moribund\r\nunder-estimated both the underlying geographical bases of its existence and\r\nits great natural resources; they emphasised what separates rather than\r\nwhat unites. In short, they saw the rivalry between the two mottoes \"Divide\r\net Impera\" and \"Viribus Unitis,\" and laid undue stress upon the former.\r\nJust because they realised the extraordinarily complicated nature of the\r\nracial problems involved, they tended to overlook the steady advance\r\nmade in recent years by Austria in the conceptions of political and\r\nconstitutional freedom. But at every turn Hungary has been Austria's evil\r\ngenius: the influence of the Magyar oligarchy has given a reactionary\r\nflavour alike to internal and to foreign policy, has hampered every reform,\r\nand poisoned the relations of the State with its southern neighbours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUSTRIA-HUNGARY: POLITICAL DIVISIONS]\r\n\r\nFor a short time the aggressive Balkan policy of Count Aehrenthal, as\r\nexemplified in the annexation of Bosnia and the diplomatic duel with\r\nRussia, was hailed as worthy of the Bismarckian tradition; but it soon\r\nbecame clear that he was far from being the genius whose advent the\r\nMonarchy was so anxiously awaiting. In recent years, then, despite many\r\nhopeful signs, and despite increasing activity in almost every sphere of\r\nlife, a kind of progressive paralysis has taken hold upon the body-politic.\r\nThree main causes may be noted--the lack of any great men capable of\r\ncounteracting the Emperor's lack of initiative, which was always very\r\nmarked, but has been accentuated by advancing old age; the superficial and\r\nmalicious outlook of the capital and the classes which control it; the\r\nalliance between the Magyar oligarchy and the Jewish press and Haute\r\nFinance, working in a pronouncedly anti-Slav direction. The wheels\r\nstill went round, but the machine of State made less and less progress:\r\nstagnation and aimlessness were everywhere apparent. On all sides it was\r\nrecognised that the existing system had become unworkable, and that a\r\ncatastrophe could only be averted by speedy reforms. To many far-seeing\r\npatriots the last hope of salvation for the State seemed to lie with the\r\nlate Heir-Apparent, not perhaps as the ideal Prince, but as a man of\r\ncourage and force of character, possessing the necessary energy to carry\r\nthrough drastic political changes. His removal was a crushing blow to all\r\nwho still hoped against hope in the regeneration of the Monarchy. His place\r\nwas filled by a young man, lacking both experience and prestige; never was\r\nthere less sign of the heaven-born genius who alone could save a desperate\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIn the life of nations and States, as in that of individuals, there\r\nsometimes comes a moment when it is possible to make the \"Great Refusal\"\r\nof which Dante sang; and \"History teaches that those who decline, or\r\nprove unworthy of, the leading rôle which is offered to them, are trodden\r\nmercilessly underfoot.\" In closing the German edition of my book with these\r\nwords, I expressed the conviction that \"for a State such as Austria there\r\ncould only be one choice\"; but unhappily her statesmen have preferred the\r\nfatal alternative.[1] \"The historic mission of the House of Habsburg is the\r\nvindication of equal rights and liberties for all races committed to its\r\ncharge. The abandonment of this mission would endanger the very existence\r\nof a Great Power upon the Middle Danube.\"[2] Austria has proved untrue to\r\nthis mission, and the inexorable forces of history seem at this moment to\r\nbe working her destruction. Nations, like individuals, sometimes commit\r\nsuicide; and those who have most earnestly warned them against such a crime\r\nare left as mourners in the funeral procession.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In July 1911 I dedicated _The Southern Slav Question_ to \"that\r\nAustrian statesman who shall have the courage and the genius necessary to\r\nsolve the Southern Slav Question.\" In April 1913, in publishing a German\r\nedition, I added the words, \"At the twelfth hour this dedication is\r\nrepeated.\" In November 1914 it is unhappily only too evident that that hour\r\nhas already struck.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See _Racial Problems in Hungary_, concluding sentence.]\r\n\r\nThe war-fever which seized upon the populace of Vienna and Budapest last\r\nJuly typified the feelings of the three dominant races in the Monarchy, the\r\nGermans, the Magyars, and the Jews; but it is no criterion for the attitude\r\nof large masses of the population. In fact, the war has accentuated the\r\ncentrifugal tendencies which were so marked a feature of recent years, and\r\nwhich the introduction of Universal Suffrage and the annexation of Bosnia\r\narrested but failed to eradicate; a stringent censorship may conceal, but\r\ncannot alter, this fact. Disaffection is rife in portions of the army and\r\naffects its powers of resistance, while the financial and economic crisis\r\ngrows from week to week. Cynics have tried to define the mutual relations\r\nof Germany and Austria-Hungary by comparing the former to a strong man\r\ncarrying a corpse upon his shoulders, and the course of the war during\r\nthe first three months would seem to confirm this view. So far as\r\nAustria-Hungary is concerned, its two outstanding features have been the\r\nsignal failure of the \"punitive expedition\" against Serbia and the debacle\r\nof Auffenberg's army in Galicia. Friendly observers were prepared for a\r\nbreak-down in the higher command and were aware that many Slav regiments\r\ncould not be relied upon, but they had expected more from the German and\r\nMagyar sections of the army and from the very efficient officers' corps, as\r\na stiffening element. It is now known that despite the aggressive policy\r\nof its chiefs, the Austro-Hungarian army was far from ready, and that its\r\ncommissariat and sanitary arrangements utterly broke down.\r\n\r\nThe evident failure to profit by the experience of two general\r\nmobilisations within the previous six years is in itself a proof that there\r\nis \"something rotten in the state,\" and it is already obvious that only a\r\ncomplete and crushing victory of Germany can extricate Austria-Hungary from\r\nthe war without loss of prestige and actual territory. Unless the Russians\r\ncan be not merely defeated but driven out, it is absolutely certain that\r\nthey will retain the province of Galicia, or at least the eastern portion,\r\nwith its Ruthene or Ukrainian population; unless the Serbian army can be\r\noverwhelmed, Bosnia and at least some portion of Dalmatia will fall into\r\nthe hands of Serbia. This would be an eminently unsatisfactory solution\r\nor rather it would be no solution at all, for it would solve neither the\r\nPolish, the Ukraine, nor the Southern Slav questions. I merely refer to it\r\nas a possible outcome of one form of stalemate; it is hardly necessary to\r\nadd that from every point of view stalemate is the result which is most\r\nto be dreaded, since it inevitably involves fresh wars in the immediate\r\nfuture. Whatever happens, the effete Dual System in its present form is\r\ndoomed, for while an Austrian defeat means dissolution, an Austrian victory\r\nmeans the absorption of Serbia and Montenegro, and in either case the\r\nbalance between Austria and Hungary will be fatally disturbed and a new\r\nconstitutional arrangement rendered inevitable. It is thus a tragic paradox\r\nthat while the attempt to bolster up the Dual System was undoubtedly one of\r\nthe great underlying causes of the war, its first effect is likely to be\r\nthe collapse of that very system.\r\n\r\nThe Dual System once abolished, it might seem reasonable to aim at a\r\nreconstruction of Austria-Hungary on a modified federal basis. But this was\r\nessentially a peace-ideal. The war, far from kindling a common patriotism\r\nwhich in Austria-Hungary was so conspicuous by its absence, has placed a\r\ngulf of blood between race and race, and rendered their continued existence\r\nunder the same roof not only difficult but undesirable. Even in the event\r\nof only relative failure on the part of Austria-Hungary a much more radical\r\nsolution may be expected, while the effect of her complete defeat would be\r\nto place the solution of the whole \"Austrian problem\" in the hands of the\r\nEntente Powers and of her own disaffected populations. In that case there\r\nare two probable alternatives, one more radical than the other. Both depend\r\nto a large extent upon the development of the military situation and upon\r\nas yet incalculable economic influences, but it is possible to indicate\r\ntheir broad outlines. Indeed, this is the best means of illustrating the\r\nconflicting fears and aspirations which the great conflict has still\r\nfurther intensified in the racial whirlpool of Central Europe. Let us\r\nconsider the less drastic of the two first.\r\n\r\nAustria, as distinguished from Hungary, consists of seventeen provinces,\r\nof which Galicia is the largest and most populous; yet there are many\r\nAustrians who have long regarded its possession as anything but an unmixed\r\nblessing for the Monarchy as a whole, and would scarcely regret its loss.\r\nIt has always occupied a peculiar autonomous position of its own; its\r\npolitical, social, and economic conditions are at least a century behind\r\nthose of the neighbouring provinces, and have given rise to many gross\r\nscandals. It has been a hot-bed of agrarian unrest, electoral corruption,\r\nand international espionage. Instead of paying its own way, it has been\r\nfinancially a heavy drag upon the State, while racially it provides, in the\r\nPolish-Ruthene conflict, an object-lesson on the disagreeable fact that\r\nan oppressed race can become an oppressor when occasion arises. But the\r\nargument which weighs most with the Germans of Austria is that the Poles\r\nof Galicia have for a whole generation held in their hands the political\r\nbalance in the Austrian Parliament, and that the disappearance of\r\nthe Polish and Ruthene deputies would destroy the Slav majority and\r\ncorrespondingly strengthen the Germans. The Magyars in their turn would no\r\ndoubt view with some alarm the extension of the Russian frontier to the\r\nline of the Carpathians; but the change would bring to them certain obvious\r\ncompensations, since it would greatly increase the relative importance of\r\nHungary inside what was left of the Habsburg Monarchy. In short, it is\r\nby no means impossible that if the Russians succeed in holding Galicia,\r\nAustria-Hungary may show a sudden alacrity to buy peace by disgorging a\r\nprovince which has never wholly fitted into her geographical or political\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the fate of the small province of Bukovina is bound up\r\nwith that of Galicia; and in such circumstances as we have just indicated,\r\nit would doubtless be divided between Russia and Roumania on broad\r\nethnographical lines, the northern districts being Ruthene, the southern\r\nRoumanian. This, however, must depend upon the attitude of the kingdom of\r\nRoumania, to which reference will be made later.\r\n\r\nThere is one other direction in which Austria could afford to surrender\r\nterritory, without serious loss save that of prestige. The southern portion\r\nof Tirol--the so-called Trentino, the district round the town of Trent--is\r\npurely Italian by race, and its union with the kingdom of Italy has long\r\nbeen the chief point in the programme of the Italian Irredentists or\r\nextreme Nationalists. It is a poor and mountainous country, which belongs\r\ngeographically to its southern rather than to its northern neighbour. The\r\npronouncedly Italian sympathies of its inhabitants have complicated the\r\nproblem of government and have been a permanent source of friction between\r\nAustria and Italy. The elaborate fortifications along the existing frontier\r\nwould have to be sacrificed, but the new racial frontier could soon be made\r\nequally satisfactory from a strategic point of view. It should then be\r\nborne in mind that at a later stage of the war an attempt may be made by\r\nAustria to buy off Italy with the offer of the Trentino. Whether the latter\r\nwould seriously consider such an offer, if made, will doubtless depend\r\nupon future events, but it is clear that Italy, if her diplomatists are\r\nsufficiently adroit, has a fair prospect of acquiring the Trentino,\r\nwhichever side wins, and consequently that a much more tempting bait will\r\nbe required in order to induce her to abandon her neutrality. These two\r\nlosses, the one already probable, the other hypothetical, would still leave\r\nAustria in the unquestioned position of a Great Power. The problem of her\r\nfuture relations with her Balkan neighbours raises an infinitely more\r\ncomplicated issue. Let us consider the Southern Slav and Roumanian\r\nquestions, first separately, and then in their bearing upon each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n§6. _The Southern Slav Question_.--The Southern Slav question, as\r\nhas already been argued in an earlier chapter, can only be treated\r\nsatisfactorily as an organic whole; and it may be taken for granted that\r\nAustria-Hungary, in the event of victory, will annex the two independent\r\nSerb kingdoms, and unite the whole Serbo-Croat race under Habsburg rule.\r\nThe task of governing them, when once she has overcome their resistance,\r\nwill be one of extraordinary difficulty, and will involve a complete\r\nrevision of her own standards of government and administration. Her record\r\nand that of Hungary in the Slavonic South does not inspire one with\r\nconfidence as to the result. Moreover, it is not too much to assert that\r\nthe destruction of Serb independence--a task which the present writer\r\nunhesitatingly regards as beyond the powers of Austria--will in no way\r\nsolve the Southern Slav problem, but merely transfer its centre of\r\ngravity. The task of Southern Slav liberation would pass to Bulgaria, and\r\nAustria-Hungary would be involved in an ever-widening field of hostilities.\r\nHence, even if Serbia's independence were not now inextricably bound up\r\nwith the success of the British arms, it would still be essential that\r\nevery effort should be made to heal what has long been an open sore upon\r\nthe face of Europe. People in this country are only too apt to ignore the\r\nquestion altogether, or at best to say, \"Oh yes, of course, if the Allies\r\nwin, the Serbs will get Bosnia.\" Those who talk thus have not grasped the\r\nelements of the great problem, of which Bosnia, like Serbia itself, is only\r\none section. The idea that to transfer Bosnia alone from Austro-Hungarian\r\nto Serbian hands would settle anything whatever, fatally ignores alike the\r\nlaws of geography and those considerations of national sentiment\r\nwhich dominate politics in South-Eastern Europe. In every respect\r\nBosnia-Herzegovina and Dalmatia complement each other. So long as there\r\nwere no railways in the Balkans and Bosnia stagnated under Turkish rule, so\r\nlong as the national consciousness of the Serbo-Croats slumbered or ran in\r\npurely provincial channels, the separation between coast and hinterland\r\nwas possible, though even then unnatural. But with the advent of modern\r\neconomic ideas the situation radically changed. It was above all the\r\npossession of the Dalmatian seaboard that tempted Austria to occupy Bosnia,\r\nand so conversely the acquisition of Bosnia by Serbia would at once\r\ncompel the latter, willy-nilly (quite apart from all racial affinities or\r\nsentiments), to aspire to Dalmatia as well.\r\n\r\nGeographically, it is inconceivable that to-day Dalmatia should be in\r\ndifferent hands from Bosnia-Herzegovina. Herzegovina does actually touch\r\nthe sea at two places--for a few miles at the swampy mouth of the Narenta\r\nbelow Metkovié, and for a mile at Castelnuovo-Zelenika, inside the Bocche\r\ndi Cattaro. It is obvious that to allow Serbia these two outlets, while\r\nleaving their surroundings to another State, would create immediate and\r\nintolerable friction; whereas to assign the southern half of Dalmatia to\r\nBosnia, but to leave the northern half in other hands, would be keenly\r\nresented by the Dalmatians themselves, as an outrage alike upon their\r\nnational and their local traditions.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the population of Dalmatia we must apply the rival tests\r\nof history and of race. On the grounds of historical sentiment Italy might\r\nclaim Dalmatia; for its chief towns (Zara, Sebenico, Trau, Spalato, Lesina,\r\nCurzola)[1] were Venetian colonies, and not only they but even the Republic\r\nof Ragusa, which always maintained an independent existence, were saturated\r\nwith Italian culture and ideals. But on ethnical grounds Dalmatia is now\r\noverwhelmingly Slavonic. In 1900 only 3.1 per cent of its population--in\r\nother words, about 15,000 out of a total of 584,000--were Italians, the\r\nremaining 97 per cent being Serbo-Croats. The census of 1910 is even more\r\nunfavourable to the Italians, probably unduly so. It is, of course, true\r\nthat the Italian element, though numerically negligible, represents a\r\nhigher percentage of the educated and cultured class; but while this would\r\nentitle Italy to demand guarantees for the maintenance of existing Italian\r\nschools and institutions, it cannot conceivably be employed as an argument\r\nin favour of an Italian occupation. Not only would it bring her inevitably\r\ninto collision with the Southern Slavs who already are, and are likely to\r\nremain, a military power of no mean order; it would lead her on into the\r\nfalse and hopeless path of attempting to assimilate a hostile population\r\nby the aid of an insignificant minority which only exists in half a dozen\r\ntowns, and in all the rest of the province is simply non-existent. The\r\nprice paid would be the eternal enmity of all Slavs, the jeopardising of\r\nItalian interests in the Balkans, the sacrifice of many of the\r\nbenefits which the new Trans-Balkan railway route\r\n(Odessa-Bucarest-Kladovo-Sarajevo-Spalato) would naturally bring to Italy,\r\na challenge to one of the finest maritime races in Europe--the Croats of\r\nDalmatia, Croatia and Istria--a challenge which would sooner or later\r\ninvolve the creation of a Southern Slav navy against Italy. So far as\r\nBritain is concerned, to separate Dalmatia from Bosnia is not only to\r\nprevent even the beginnings of a solution of the Southern Slav question,\r\nbut to obscure the naval situation in the Mediterranean, to alienate Russia\r\nin a matter in which we have everything to gain and nothing to lose by\r\naccommodating her. But even when Bosnia and Dalmatia have been united to\r\nSerbia and Montenegro, the Southern Slav problem will still be far from\r\nsolution. Dalmatia is alike in constitutional theory and in political\r\nfantasy, though not in sober fact, an integral portion of the Triune\r\nKingdom of Croatia-Slavonia-Dalmatia, and it is unthinkable that\r\nSerbo-Croat opinion could ever consent to the liberation of the one without\r\nthe other. No solution has any chance of permanence which ignores Agram as\r\nthe centre of Croat political and religious life, of education, art and\r\nhistoric memories. The Dalmatian Croats, as the most virile and stubborn\r\nelement in the race, have always formed the vanguard of political thought,\r\nbut it is to Agram that they have always turned for the necessary backing,\r\nand it is the peasantry of Croatia who have always borne the brunt of every\r\nattempt at repression. Latterly the Dalmatians have been the soul of\r\nthe student movement, which plays so vital a part in recent political\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the West they are only known under their Italian names, but\r\nat home they are known as Zadar, Sibenik, Trogir, Split, Hvar, Korcula,\r\nand Dubrovnik (Ragusa).]\r\n\r\nCroatia-Slavonia is a vital part of the problem, indeed from a national\r\npoint of view perhaps more vital than Bosnia and Dalmatia. But even this is\r\nnot enough. No settlement will be complete which ignores the Slovenes of\r\neastern Istria, Carniola, and southern Carinthia and Styria: they must\r\nshare the fate of their Croat and Serb kinsmen.\r\n\r\nSo far, then, as the Southern Slavs are concerned, the triumph of the\r\nAllies ought to mean the creation of a new State on the Eastern Adriatic,\r\nthe expansion of gallant Serbia into Jugoslavia (Jug is the Slav word for\r\nsouth), and the achievement of Unity by the three kindred races, Serbs,\r\nCroats, and Slovenes. On the north it would be comparatively easy to draw\r\na new frontier corresponding to the main requirements of ethnography,\r\ngeography, and strategy. With only very slight deviations, this would\r\nfollow the racial line between Slovenes and Germans from the present\r\nItalian frontier as far as the little town of Radkersburg in Styria;\r\nthence, the course of the rivers Mur and Drave as far as the latter's\r\njunction with the Danube. It is only in the Banat--that portion of the\r\ngreat Hungarian plain which faces Belgrade across the Danube--that an\r\nartificial frontier will be inevitable, if the Serb districts of Hungary\r\nare to be included in the new State and if the Serb capital is to be\r\nrendered immune from the dangers of future bombardment. The weak spot in\r\nso drastic a solution is the inclusion of the Slovene districts, which--in\r\nview of their geographical position, cutting off the German provinces of\r\nAustria from the sea--is unthinkable, save in the event of a complete\r\ncollapse of the Monarchy. All depends upon the number of leaves which are\r\npulled off the artichoke. If only a few of the outer rows are taken,\r\na situation may arise in which it would be necessary to sacrifice the\r\nSlovenes and to rest satisfied with the acquisition of Bosnia, Dalmatia,\r\nand Croatia--in other words, with the frontier which at present divides\r\nCroatia from Austria and from Hungary proper. But this, it must be\r\nremembered, would leave the work of Southern Slav Unity incomplete, and is\r\nonly to be regarded as a _pis aller._\r\n\r\nThe Slovene section of the Southern Slav problem is further complicated by\r\nthe attitude of Italy, who cannot be indifferent to the fate of Trieste and\r\nPola. On historic grounds Italy cannot lay claim to Trieste, which has been\r\na possession of the House of Habsburg since 1386 (400 years longer than\r\nDalmatia). But if as before we apply the principle of nationality, it is\r\nindisputable that Trieste is an Italian town, though the whole surrounding\r\ncountry up to the very suburbs is purely Slovene. On the other hand, the\r\ncommercial interests of Trieste are entirely bound up with its hinterland,\r\nby which is meant not only the Alpine provinces, but Upper and Lower\r\nAustria and Bohemia on the one hand and even south Germany (Bavaria) on\r\nthe other. Any settlement, then, must be a compromise between national and\r\neconomic interests. As an ancient centre of Italian culture, Trieste\r\nwould welcome the flag of the Regno upon its municipality, as the surest\r\nguarantee that the town would remain Italian in character to all time. But\r\nany attempt to include Trieste within the tariff system of the kingdom of\r\nItaly would produce fatal results, and the obvious solution is to proclaim\r\nthe city as a free commercial port. Of course, from a purely Southern\r\nSlav point of view, the fate of the town of Trieste (as distinct from the\r\ndistrict) ought to be a matter of complete indifference, though of course\r\nthe extremists claim it. It is, however, well to bear in mind that the\r\ninclusion of Trieste in Italy's tariff system would mean the speedy\r\neconomic ruin of a great and flourishing commercial centre. Commercially,\r\nthen, Trieste is unthinkable save either as the port of Austria or as a\r\n_porto franco_ under Italian suzerainty. So far as Istria is concerned,\r\nthere would be no insurmountable difficulty in drawing a satisfactory\r\nfrontier on ethnographical lines; the western portions, including\r\nCapodistria, Rovigno, and Pola, are overwhelmingly Italian, while the\r\ninterior of the little province and the eastern shore (with Abbazia,\r\nLovrana, etc.) is as overwhelmingly Slavonic (Croat and Slovene mixed).\r\nAny redistribution of territory on the basis of nationality must therefore\r\ninevitably assign western Istria to Italy, and no reasonable Southern Slav\r\nwould raise any valid objection. Once more the essential fact to consider\r\nis that the acquisition of Trieste and Pola by Italy presupposes the\r\ndisappearance of Austria-Hungary; otherwise it is not even remotely\r\npossible. Hence it is no exaggeration to assert that the fate of Trieste\r\nis one of the central issues in the whole European settlement. Once\r\nmake Trieste a free port, under the Italian flag, and _ipso facto_ the\r\nAustro-Hungarian navy ceases to exist, and with it all need for Italian\r\nnaval activity in the Adriatic. In other words, such a settlement would\r\nlead to an almost idyllic reduction of naval armaments in the Adriatic,\r\nsince both Italy and the new Jugoslavia could afford to restrict\r\nthemselves to a minimum of coast defence. It is obvious, however, that the\r\ndismantlement of Pola--to-day an almost impregnable fortress--would be an\r\nessential condition to neighbourly relations between the two, the more so\r\nsince under such altered circumstances an Italian naval base at Pola could\r\nonly have one objective.\r\n\r\nThere is an unfortunate tendency in Italy to misread the whole situation\r\non the eastern Adriatic, to ignore the transformation which the revival\r\nof Southern Slav consciousness has wrought in lands which once owned the\r\nsupremacy of Venice. A short-sighted distrust of the Slav blinds many\r\nItalians to the double fact that he has come to stay, and that his\r\nfriendship is to be had for the asking. The commercial future of Dalmatia,\r\nBosnia, and Serbia is intimately bound up with Italy, and Italy herself\r\nwill be the chief loser if she closes her eyes to so patent a truth.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Trieste and Istria is a triangular issue between Teuton, Slav,\r\nand Latin. The Italian, if his claims are too ambitious or exacting, may\r\nsucceed in preventing the Slav from obtaining his share of the spoils, but\r\nonly by leaving them all in the hands of a still more dangerous rival, in\r\nother words, by a crude policy of dog-in-the-manger.\r\n\r\nOne thing is certain in all this interplay of forces--that it is too late\r\nin the day to suppress Southern Slav national consciousness, and that there\r\ncan never be durable peace and contentment on the eastern Adriatic until\r\nthe unity of the race has been achieved. It would be premature to discuss\r\nthe exact forms which the new State would assume; but when the time\r\ncomes it will be found that the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina, Dalmatia,\r\nCroatia-Slavonia, Istria and Carniola, will acclaim their liberation at the\r\nhands of free Serbia and Montenegro. Their watchword, however, will be not\r\nconquest from without, but free and voluntary union from within--a union\r\nwhich will preserve their existing political institutions and culture as a\r\nworthy contribution to the common Southern Slav fund. The natural solution\r\nis a federal union under which the sovereign would be crowned not only as\r\nKing of Serbia but with the crown of Zvonomir as King of the Triune Kingdom\r\nof Croatia-Slavonia-Dalmatia, thus reviving historic traditions dating from\r\nthe tenth century and never abandoned or forgotten. The Croatian Parliament\r\nwould continue in Agrani, parallel with the Serb Parliament in Belgrade,\r\nbut both would be represented in a central federal Parliament. The only\r\nquestion is whether the existing provincial divisions should be allowed to\r\nsurvive, the Diets of Bosnia, Dalmatia, Istria, and Carniola thus forming\r\nconjointly with the Serbian, Montenegrin, and Croatian Parliaments\r\nthe units on which the new constitution is based, or whether complete\r\nunification should be attempted. The latter would be the ideal arrangement,\r\nbut in view of the great divergence of local customs and institutions it\r\nwould probably be premature, and it might therefore be wiser to preserve\r\nthe smaller units until they were ripe for fusion, rather than to\r\ncompromise by creating a dual State of Serbia and Croatia.\r\n\r\n\r\n§7. _The Roumanian Question._--I have dwelt at some length upon the\r\nSouthern Slav problem, because it is as complicated as it is unfamiliar\r\nto public opinion in this country. It has been the _causa causans_ of the\r\npresent struggle, and if neglected or mismanaged at the final settlement,\r\nmay again plunge Europe into trouble at some future date. Parallel with\r\nany solution of the Southern Slav question must come the solution of the\r\nRoumanian question, which represents the other half of Austria-Hungary's\r\nBalkan policy. The Kingdom of Roumania is, alike in territory, population,\r\nand resources, the leading power in the Balkan peninsula, but over five\r\nmillion Roumanians, including the very cream of the race, still live under\r\nforeign domination. Of these at least 3,500,000 are in Austria-Hungary, the\r\ngreat majority under the grossly oppressive rule of the Magyars; and the\r\nredemption of Transylvania and the neighbouring counties of Hungary has\r\nalways been the ideal of all patriotic Roumanians, even of those who looked\r\nto a distant future for its realisation. Russia's short-sighted policy in\r\n1878, in annexing the Roumanian province of Bessarabia as a reward for\r\ntheir valiant support at Plevna, drove the Roumanians into the arms of\r\nAustria-Hungary, and for a whole generation not even the perpetual irritant\r\nof Magyar tyranny in Transylvania could avail to shake the _entente_\r\nbetween Vienna and Bucarest, strengthened as it was by the personal\r\nfriendship of the Emperor Francis Joseph and King Charles. But the spell\r\nwas broken by Austria's attitude during the Balkan War. The imperious force\r\nof circumstances brought the interests of Roumania and Serbia into line;\r\nfor it was obvious that any blow aimed against Serbia's independent\r\nexistence must threaten Roumania also, just as any weakening of the\r\nSerbo-Croat element in the Monarchy must react unfavourably on that of\r\nthe Roumanians and other nationalities of Hungary. The growth of national\r\nfeeling within the two neighbour races has proceeded for some time past on\r\nparallel lines, and even before the war there were manifest signs that\r\nthe Roumanians of Hungary, whose economic and cultural progress since the\r\nbeginning of the century has been very rapid, were at length nearing the\r\nend of their patience. The bomb outrage at Debreczen last February--an\r\nevent which is without parallel in Roumanian history--was the first\r\nmuttering of the gathering storm. Roumania occupies a position of extreme\r\ndelicacy. Her natural tendency would be to espouse the cause of the Allies,\r\nsince they obviously have more to offer her than their rivals. But the\r\nsomewhat equivocal attitude of her statesmen has been determined not merely\r\nby an astute desire to win the spoils of war without making the necessary\r\nsacrifice--a policy which is apt to overreach itself--but also by a very\r\npardonable anxiety as to the attitude of Bulgaria and Turkey. Roumania has\r\nhitherto been the foremost upholder of the Treaty of Bucarest, and it is\r\nonly in the event of drastic territorial changes farther west that she is\r\nlikely to consent to its being torn up. She has made no secret of the fact\r\nthat she would not tolerate naked aggression against the Greeks, whether\r\nfrom the Turkish or Bulgarian side. In view of the political record of King\r\nFerdinand of Bulgaria and his present Prime Minister, the Roumanians may\r\nperhaps be excused for adopting an attitude of vigilant reserve; for their\r\nstatesmen suspect that Bulgaria is only waiting until the Roumanian army\r\nhas crossed the Carpathians in order to reoccupy the southern Dobrudja.\r\nCertain it is that Roumania, while declining all temptations to join the\r\ncentral powers, has also rejected the Russian invitation to occupy the\r\nBukovina, and has actually approached Hungary with a view to securing the\r\nrestoration of Transylvanian autonomy. The Magyars on their part have tried\r\nto buy off Roumania by introducing the Roumanian language of instruction in\r\nmany of the State schools of Transylvania--a wholly inadequate concession\r\nwhich would none the less have been inconceivable four short months ago.\r\nUnfortunately the realisation of Roumanian unity inevitably involves the\r\ninclusion in the new State of considerable Magyar and Saxon minorities,\r\namounting in all to not less than 600,000 inhabitants. There are no means\r\nof overcoming the hard facts of geography, but it is essential that\r\nRoumania, while incorporating Magyar and Saxon islets in the Roumanian\r\nracial sea, should guarantee the existing institutions of the two races,\r\nand the fullest possible linguistic freedom in church,[1] school, and\r\npress. The Saxons in particular have preserved their identity for over\r\nseven centuries in this little corner of the Carpathians, and have\r\ncontributed far more than their share to the cause of culture and progress\r\nin Hungary. It would be a crying irony of fate if they were allowed to\r\nperish in the twentieth century at the hands of those who have pledged\r\nthemselves to vindicate the rights of smaller nationalities.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Szekel (Magyar) districts of Transylvania are mainly\r\nCalvinist, the Saxons Lutheran to a man, while the Roumanians are divided\r\nbetween the Orthodox and the Roumanian Uniate Churches. Transylvania is\r\nalso the centre of an interesting sect of Unitarians, who are for the most\r\npart Magyar by race.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be forgotten that the dream of Roumanian Unity can only be\r\nfully realised if Russia restores at least a portion of Bessarabia, which\r\ncontains not less than a million and a quarter Roumanians. A victorious\r\nRussia might well afford such a concession; for it would involve no\r\nstrategic dangers and would, especially if conveyed in the graceful form of\r\na wedding dowry, triumphantly efface the last traces of Russophobe feeling\r\nthat still linger in Roumania. But it would be absurd to expect such\r\nmagnanimity on the part of Russia unless Roumania's action is prompt and\r\nvigorous. The abstract theory of nationality must be reinforced by the more\r\npractical argument of sterling services rendered to a common cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n§8. _Can the Dual Monarchy be replaced?_--The result of applying the\r\nprinciple of nationality to the Southern Slavs and Roumanians would thus\r\nbe to create two powerful national States at the expense of the Habsburg\r\nMonarchy; and here it is well to repeat that such drastic territorial\r\nchanges are only possible if the military power of Austria suffers\r\nan almost complete eclipse. But even the loss of Galicia, Bukovina,\r\nTransylvania, the Trentino, and the Serbo-Croat provinces would still leave\r\nAustria-Hungary a State of very considerable area, with a population of 32\r\nmillions. There is no reason why such a State should not continue to exist,\r\nprovided that it retained the necessary access to the sea at Trieste and\r\nPola, and this would involve the exclusion of the Slovenes from the\r\nnew Jugo-Slav State. Under such circumstances it would be possible to\r\nreconstruct the State on a federal basis, with five main racial units,\r\nthe Germans, the Czechs and Slovaks, the Magyars, the Slovenes, and the\r\nItalians. Certain unimportant racial minorities would still be left, but\r\nthese could unquestionably be dealt with by a law of guarantees, similar to\r\nthose which have played so conspicuous a part in the theory, but sometimes\r\nalso in the practice, of the Dual Monarchy. So many severe amputations\r\nmight, however, prove too much for the vitality of the patient; and in any\r\ncase we may assume that either Austria-Hungary will be able to prevent the\r\noperation, or that the Allies, if they can once bring matters thus far,\r\nwill insist upon completing the process by a drastic post-mortem inquiry.\r\nAny sympathetic qualms are likely to be outweighed by the consideration\r\nthat a State of this hybrid nature would tend to be more than ever a vassal\r\nof Germany. Moreover, there can be no doubt that one of the surest means of\r\nbringing Germany to her knees is by crushing her most formidable ally, and\r\nthus tapping some of the sources of her own military and economic strength.\r\nIt is safe to assume that this consideration plays an important part in the\r\nmilitary plans of Russia; and for many reasons--political, strategic, and\r\neconomic--a Russian occupation of Bohemia must be regarded as the essential\r\nprelude to a decisive victory of the Allies. The war has thrown the\r\nDual Monarchy into the melting-pot; but it is not enough to accept the\r\npossibility of its disappearance from the map, it is also necessary to\r\nconsider what new organisms would take its place. A complete partition\r\nwould, as we have seen, remove the last obstacle to a unified Southern\r\nSlav State. The dreams of Italia Irredenta and Greater Roumania would\r\nbe realised. Western Galicia and a part of Silesia would be united to\r\nautonomous Poland as reconstituted by the Russian Tsar. Eastern Galicia,\r\nNorthern Bukovina, and the Ruthene districts of Hungary as far as Ungvár\r\nand Munkács, would be incorporated in the Russian Empire, though it is\r\nto be hoped that an early result of this change would be the grant of a\r\ncertain modified autonomy, or at least of special linguistic and religious\r\nprivileges, to the Ukraine population, thus united after centuries of\r\npartition in a single body politic.\r\n\r\n\r\n§9. _Bohemia and Hungary._--But the most striking result of the partition\r\nwould be the revival of the famous mediaeval kingdoms of Bohemia and\r\nHungary as independent States. Thus would be realised the dream of two\r\nraces, the Czechs and Magyars, whose national revival forms one of the\r\nmost romantic incidents of the nineteenth century. But it is difficult to\r\nimagine a greater contrast than their respective development. In Bohemia\r\nthe Czechs, after losing their religious and civic liberty and enduring for\r\ntwo centuries the domination of the Germans, raised themselves once more\r\nin the course of two generations, by sheer force of character and tireless\r\nindustry, to a position of equality, and reorganised their national life on\r\nan essentially democratic basis. In Hungary the Magyars, thanks to their\r\ncentral position, their superior political sense, and their possession of\r\na powerful aristocracy, succeeded in concentrating all government and\r\nadministration in their own hands and reducing the other races of the\r\ncountry, who have always formed a majority of the population, to a state of\r\nveritable political helotry. And just as their evolution has been on very\r\ndifferent lines, so must be their future fate. In Bohemia all is activity\r\nand political progress, in Hungary the sterility of a corrupt and\r\nreactionary system, staking the future upon the hollow credit of\r\na long-vanished past. The Czechs are beyond all question the most\r\nprogressive, the most highly civilised, the most democratic of all Slavonic\r\nnations. The stubborn spirit of John Hus is still alive among them to-day,\r\nand their recent achievements in music, art, and industry are in every way\r\nworthy of the nation which has produced Comenius and Dvorák and first\r\nlit the torch of Reformation in Europe. The ancient city of Prague contains\r\nall the elements of culture necessary for the regeneration of Bohemia, and\r\nthe mineral riches and industrial resources of the country are infinitely\r\ngreater than those of many European States which have successfully led a\r\nseparate national existence.\r\n\r\nBut the liberation of the Czechs would not be complete unless their close\r\nkinsmen the Slovaks were included in the new Bohemian State; and every\r\nreason alike of politics, race, and geography tells overwhelmingly in\r\nfavour of such an arrangement. The Slovaks, who would to the last man\r\nwelcome the change, have long suffered from the gross tyranny of Magyar\r\nrule. Their schools and institutions have been ruthlessly suppressed or\r\nreduced in numbers, their press muzzled, their political development\r\narrested, their culture and traditions--far more truly autochthonous than\r\nthose of the conquering Magyar invaders--have been discouraged and hampered\r\nat every turn. The Slovaks are a race whose artistic and musical gifts,\r\nwhose innate sense of colour and poetry have won the sympathy and\r\nadmiration of all who know them; and their systematic oppression at the\r\nhands of the Magyar oligarchy is one of the greatest infamies of the last\r\nfifty years. In this war Britain has proclaimed herself the champion of\r\nthe small nations, and none are more deserving of her sympathy than the\r\nSlovaks. Unless our statesmen renounce that principle of nationality which\r\nthey have so loudly proclaimed, the Slovaks cannot be abandoned to their\r\nfate; for they form an essential part of the Bohemian problem. Without\r\nthem the new kingdom could not stand alone, isolated as it would be among\r\nhostile or indifferent neighbours. In every way the Slovak districts form\r\nthe natural continuation of Bohemia and are the necessary link between it\r\nand Russia, upon whose moral support the new State must rely in the first\r\ncritical years of its existence.\r\n\r\nThe main difficulty would be the fate of racial minorities; for minorities\r\nthere still must be, no matter how the frontiers may be drawn. At first\r\nsight the natural solution would be to pare down Bohemia by assigning\r\nto the neighbouring provinces of Germany the German fringe which almost\r\ncompletely surrounds the Czech kernel. So far as the south-west and\r\nnorth-east districts of Bohemia (near Budweis and along the German Silesian\r\nborder) are concerned, the historic boundaries might fairly be revised on\r\nethnographic lines, and in the same way the line of demarcation between\r\nBohemia and Hungary could in the main be made to follow the racial boundary\r\nbetween Slovak and Magyar and later between Slovak and Ruthene. But in the\r\nnorth of Bohemia there are insurmountable objections to any revision of the\r\nhistoric frontier of the kingdom; for not merely is its industrial life\r\nconcentrated to a very considerable degree in the German districts, but\r\nthis fact is responsible for the existence of important Czech industrial\r\nminorities, which it would be difficult to sacrifice. So far as there is to\r\nbe any sacrifice, it must be made by the losers rather than by the winners\r\nin this war. But it ought to be possible, under the rule of some\r\ncarefully selected western prince as ruler of Bohemia, to devise proper\r\nadministrative guarantees for the linguistic rights of minorities in every\r\nmixed district of Bohemia, whether it be Czech or German. The case of\r\nHungary is different. That the Allies, if victorious, should perpetuate the\r\nracial hegemony of the Magyars, and with it many of the abuses which have\r\ncontributed towards the present war, is as unthinkable as that they should\r\nonce more bolster up the Turkish régime. If the Habsburg Monarchy should\r\nbreak up, Hungary is fully entitled to her independence. She will become a\r\nnational Magyar State, but in a sense very different from that which her\r\nJingo politicians have intended--not by assimilating the non-Magyar races\r\nof the country, but by losing to the other national States by which she\r\nwill be surrounded all but the purely Magyar districts of the central\r\nplains. Hungary will then be more fully than before a Danubian State; her\r\nrich alluvial lands will be developed, and a check will be put upon the\r\nunnecessary streams of Magyar emigration which the present political and\r\neconomic situation favours. The chief gainer by the change will be the\r\nMagyar peasantry, who have in their own way been exploited by the ruling\r\noligarchy as cruelly as their non-Magyar neighbours. One result of the war\r\nwill be to discredit the policy and methods of this oligarchy and to hasten\r\nthe break-up of the vast latifundia of the great magnates and the Church,\r\nand those other drastic land reforms without which Hungary cannot hope to\r\nattain her full economic value as the granary of central Europe. Hitherto\r\nthe government of the day has secured a parliamentary majority by\r\ncorrupting and terrorising the non-Magyar constituencies of the periphery\r\nand thus out-voting the radical Magyar stalwarts of the great plain; and\r\nwith the loss of the Slovak, Ruthene and Roumanian districts this system\r\nwould automatically collapse. The result might be a genuine strengthening\r\nof democratic elements and the dawn of a new era for the Magyar race.\r\n\r\n\r\n§10. _Germany and Austria._--One final problem connected with\r\nAustria-Hungary remains. What is to be the fate of the German provinces of\r\nAustria? If the map of Europe is to be recast on a basis of nationality, we\r\nobviously cannot withhold from the great German nation that right to racial\r\nunity which we accord to the Czechs, the Poles and many minor races. The\r\nseven German provinces--Upper and Lower Austria, Styria, Carinthia, Tirol,\r\nSalzburg and Vorarlberg--reconstituted perhaps as a kingdom of Austria\r\nunder the House of Habsburg and augmented by the German population of\r\nwestern Hungary, would then become an additional federal unit in the German\r\nEmpire. Such an event, it cannot be too often repeated, is inconceivable\r\nexcept as the result of a complete defeat of the central powers, but if on\r\nthat assumption Germany loses Alsace-Lorraine and Posen, the loss would be\r\nmade good by the incorporation of German Austria. The result of this\r\nin figures would be the subtraction of six million inhabitants and the\r\naddition of eight million others--a transaction which need not unduly alarm\r\nthe British Jingo, and at the same time might render defeat less galling to\r\nthe German patriot.\r\n\r\nWhether this fulfillment of the Pan-German aspiration would meet with\r\nunqualified enthusiasm on either side of the present frontier, is a\r\nquestion on which it is not altogether easy to answer. The idea of\r\nadmitting eight million additional Catholic subjects into Germany would\r\ncertainly arouse misgivings in Prussia, both among the stricter Protestants\r\nand among the far more active section of \"intellectuals\" who merely regard\r\nProtestantism as a political asset in the struggle against Latin and\r\nSlavonic influences. From a political point of view their admission would\r\nunquestionably transform the whole parliamentary situation and force the\r\nImperial Government to revise its whole attitude; for the Austrian voters\r\nwould greatly strengthen the two parties to whose existence Prussia has\r\nnever become reconciled--the Clerical Centre and the Social Democratic\r\nLeft,--while contributing little or nothing to the parties of the\r\nConservative Junkers or the middle-class \"Liberals.\" In other words, the\r\nnew element might prove to be an effective leaven which would permeate the\r\nwhole lump. All the arguments which induced Bismarck to expel Austria\r\nfrom Germany in 1868 would still be upheld by the advocates of\r\n\"Preussen-Deutschland\" (see p. 65), and the Prussian hegemony; but after an\r\nunsuccessful war and territorial losses the chance of making these good\r\nby the achievement of national unity would probably sweep away the\r\ndissentients, who would no longer represent a triumphant system, but a\r\nbeaten and discredited caste. The old idea of the \"seventy-million Empire,\"\r\nwhich appealed so strongly to the Liberals of Frankfurt in 1848, should\r\nprove irresistible under these circumstances. The influence of Austrian\r\nGermans, already so marked in literature, art, music, and above all in\r\npolitical theory, might make itself felt in other spheres also.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, in view of the wild talk in which certain sections of the Press\r\nare already indulging, it cannot be too strongly emphasised that only the\r\nGermans can reform their political institutions, and that any attempt at\r\nexternal interference will not merely fail lamentably, but produce the very\r\nopposite effect from that which is intended. If the German Emperor insists\r\nupon confusing the relative positions of the Deity and some of his\r\nself-styled vicegerents upon earth, only the German people can restore him\r\nto a sense of proportion and modesty. All believers in human progress hope\r\nthat after this war the monstrous theories of divine right propounded\r\nby the House of Hohenzollern will be relegated to the lumber-room of a\r\nvanished past. But the sooner references to St. Helena as a residence for\r\ndeposed emperors are dismissed as arrant nonsense, the better. The future\r\nof German dynasties, as of German Unity, rests with the German people\r\nitself; and those who challenge this statement repudiate _ipso facto_\r\nthe two principles of Nationality and International Law, which we have\r\nofficially adopted as our programme for the future.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the German provinces of Austria is one of the central problems\r\nraised by this war, since it is the link between the fate of two Empires.\r\nThe present writer most emphatically disclaims all idea of prophecy; but\r\nhe feels that the time has come for outlining some of the possible\r\nalternatives which confront the statesmen of \"the new Europe.\" So far as\r\nAustria-Hungary is concerned, it is clear that the splendid dream of \"a\r\nmonarchical Switzerland,\" as conceived by many serious political thinkers,\r\nhas already died a violent death; but it would be quite premature to\r\ndogmatise on the future grouping of the races of the Dual Monarchy at a\r\nmoment when its ultimate fate has still to be decided on the field of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n§11. _Italian Aspirations._--We have already alluded to Italy's position,\r\nin connection with the Southern Slav question, and have pointed out that a\r\nsettlement which follows even approximately the lines of nationality would\r\nassign the Trentino, the town of Trieste (as a free port), and a strip\r\nof Western Istria to Italy, but the remainder of the coast from Cape\r\nPromontore to the Bojana river to the new \"Jugoslavia.\" There are, however,\r\nother directions in which Italy may claim compensation for her friendly\r\nattitude towards the Triple Entente. She has already occupied the rocky\r\nislet of Saseno, opposite Valona, and in the event of the collapse of\r\nAustria-Hungary, she may demand the whole bay of Valona, as the strategic\r\nkey to the Adriatic, and even a general protectorate of the embryo Albanian\r\nState. The establishment of a miniature Gibraltar on the eastern side of\r\nthe Straits of Otranto is a step which neither France nor Britain would\r\noppose, if Italy should insist upon it; but it may be questioned whether\r\nshe would not thereby be laying up stores of trouble for a distant future,\r\naltogether incommensurate with any possible advantages which might accrue.\r\nIndeed, Italy would probably be well advised to abandon all idea of an\r\nAlbanian adventure (which, originally conceived as a counterstroke to\r\nAustrian aggression, would lose its point if Austria disappeared from the\r\nscene), to leave the Greeks a free hand in south Epirus, to cede to them\r\nRhodes and the other islands occupied during the Tripolitan War, and then\r\nto secure, during the partition of Turkey, the reversion of Cilicia and the\r\nGulf of Alexandretta. It is in any case clear that the Powers of the Triple\r\nEntente will raise no objections to such action on the part of Italy, and\r\nare resolved to show every consideration to a power whose great and vital\r\ninterests in the Mediterranean in no way conflict with their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n§12. _The Balkan Situation: Bulgaria and Greece._--The creation of a\r\nGreater Roumania and of a new Southern Slav State would transform the whole\r\nBalkan situation, and therefore obviously involves material concessions to\r\nBulgaria and Greece.\r\n\r\n(A) If Roumania succeeds in redeeming her kinsmen across the northern\r\nfrontiers, she cannot be so ungenerous as to insist upon retaining\r\nterritory whose population is overwhelmingly Bulgarian, and the least which\r\nmight be expected from her would be the retrocession to Bulgaria of her\r\nbloodless acquisition during the second Balkan War. This means a reversion\r\nto the boundary defined under Russian arbitration at Petrograd in January\r\n1913--except outside the fortress of Silistria, where strategic reasons\r\ndemand its rectification.\r\n\r\nIt is in the relations of Bulgaria and Serbia, however, that the key to the\r\nBalkan situation is to be found. The Serbo-Bulgarian treaty of February\r\n1912, which formed the groundwork of the Balkan alliance, had limited\r\nSerbia's sphere of influence to northern Macedonia and referred to the\r\narbitration of the Russian Tsar any disputes arising from conquests to the\r\nsouth of a certain specified line. Serbia was tacitly given a free hand\r\nin her attempt to reach the sea in Northern Albania. The action of\r\nAustria-Hungary in vetoing her access to the Adriatic forced Serbia to turn\r\nher eyes from west to south and to seek her economic outlet to the sea\r\ndown the valley of the Vardar to Salonica and the Aegean. The cession of\r\nMonastir, Ochrida, and the Vardar Valley to Bulgaria would have rendered\r\nthis impossible, for it would not merely have driven a wedge between Serbia\r\nand Greece, but would have placed two customs frontiers, the Bulgarian and\r\nthe Greek, between Serbia and the sea, instead of only one, the Turkish, as\r\nhitherto. Shut in upon all sides, with all hope of expansion blocked by the\r\npowerful Dual Monarchy to north and west and by a big Bulgaria to east and\r\nsouth, Serbia would have found herself in a worse position than before the\r\nwar. The Bulgarians, intoxicated by their victories over the Turks and\r\nseduced by the promptings of the Austrian tempter, turned a deaf ear to the\r\narguments of their Serbian allies, and insisted upon their pound of flesh.\r\nThey failed to realise that the most effective way of inducing the Serbs to\r\nevacuate Macedonia was to give them adequate backing in their demand for an\r\nAdriatic port. Every fresh intrigue of Sofia with Vienna confirmed Belgrade\r\nin its view of the vital necessity for retaining the Vardar Valley. The\r\nhoary argument that \"circumstances alter cases,\" appeared anew in the garb\r\nof the Bismarckian theory that all treaties are subject to the provision\r\n\"_rebus sic stantibus_\"--a theory which many great international lawyers\r\nhave unhesitatingly endorsed. In this form it appealed as irresistibly to\r\nthe Serbs as did the rival shibboleth of \"The treaty, the whole treaty,\r\nand nothing but the treaty\" to the Bulgarians. It is impossible to absolve\r\neither side from blame; for the Serbs, in formally denouncing a treaty into\r\nwhich they had voluntarily entered, were doing exactly what they had so\r\nbitterly resented in Austria-Hungary's treatment of Bosnia, while the\r\nBulgarians, in flouting the Tsar whom they had named as arbiter and in\r\nattempting to uphold the treaty by brute force and treachery, abandoned the\r\nground of law, and placed themselves openly in the wrong.\r\n\r\nThe events of the great war have already modified the problem. The one\r\nunanswerable argument of the Serbs in declining to surrender Macedonia\r\nwas the plea that they would then have nothing to offer Bulgaria for her\r\nneutrality or her support when their own inevitable day of reckoning with\r\nAustria should arrive. In short, Veles, Monastir and Ochrida were widely\r\nregarded as a pledge to be held until Bosnia and Dalmatia could be\r\nredeemed, but then to be handed over to the Bulgarians. It is true that the\r\nSerbo-Bulgar War of 1913 and the passions which it aroused have converted\r\nthis feeling into one of reluctance to sacrifice what was bought at such a\r\nfearful price. But the moment has now arrived to translate an instinct into\r\na reality. If Southern Slav Unity is to be achieved, a binding promise,\r\nunder the guarantee of the Entente Powers, must be given to Bulgaria, that,\r\nin proportion as the work of Serbo-Croat unification is achieved, the\r\nMacedonian frontier will be revised in favour of Bulgaria. It is possible\r\nthat Bulgaria may prefer a different formula, according to which the Tsar\r\nwith the approval of his Western Allies should arbitrate upon the original\r\nSerbo-Bulgar treaty. Any such concession to Bulgarian sentiment ought not\r\nto be resented in Serbia, in view of the great issues involved. It is\r\nobvious that Serbia cannot hope to achieve her national unity unless\r\nBulgaria abstains from hostile action, or to consolidate her new position\r\nwhen won unless she can win Bulgaria's active friendship. The latter by her\r\nintervention could at any moment turn the scales against Turkey or against\r\nSerbia, and it is thus essential that the Allies should treat her now with\r\na generosity proportionate to the callous neglect with which Europe left\r\nher to her fate in September 1913.\r\n\r\nThe tendency to look down upon the Balkan States from the fancied heights\r\nof a superior \"culture\" has never been so marked in France or Britain as\r\nin Germany, where the Press is now engaged in comparing their own cultural\r\nexploits in Belgium with the lack of culture displayed by the \"bandits\" and\r\n\"assassins\" of Serbia, and where a man of such scientific distinction as\r\nWerner Sombart can describe the heroic kingdom of Montenegro as \"nothing\r\nbut a bad joke in the history of the world!\"[1] But even here the habit\r\nof condescension lingers, and amidst the threatened collapse of Western\r\ncivilisation it is well to remember the essential distinction between\r\nprimitive and savage. The Balkan nations have grown to manhood while\r\nwe slept, and must henceforth be regarded as equals in the European\r\ncommonwealth.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Berliner Tageblatt,_ cited by _Observer_, November 8, 1914.]\r\n\r\n(B) Such territorial changes as have been outlined above would vitally\r\naffect the position of Greece, who is also fully entitled to claim\r\ncompensation for any serious disturbance of the balance of power. The first\r\nand most obvious form which compensation would take is the final occupation\r\nof southern Epirus; no objections will be raised to this by the Entente\r\nPowers, and it is probable that Italy has already made her own bargain with\r\nthe Cabinet of Athens on this very point. It is to be hoped that Italy may\r\nalso consent to hand over Rhodes and the neighbouring islands to Greece, in\r\nreturn for a free hand in Southern Asia Minor in the event of the Turkish\r\nEmpire breaking up. By far the thorniest problem is provided by the future\r\nownership of Kavala, which the Treaty of Bucarest assigned to Greece in\r\nAugust 1913, but which from an economic point of view is Bulgaria's port on\r\nthe Aegean, and as vital a necessity for her future development as it is a\r\nsuperfluous luxury to Greece. The statesmen of Petrograd were not blind to\r\nthese considerations, but the scale was turned at Bucarest by the active\r\nintervention of the German Emperor, who, under the plea of seconding his\r\nbrother-in-law, King Constantine, skilfully provided a permanent bone of\r\ncontention between Bulgaria and Greece. His action may not unfairly be\r\ncompared to that of the Hungarian Premier, Count Tisza, in fomenting the\r\nquarrel between Serbia and Bulgaria two months earlier.\r\n\r\nSerbia's cession of Central Macedonia to Bulgaria could not fail to be\r\ndistasteful to the Greeks, for it would automatically render their tenure\r\nof Kavala highly precarious. It is to be hoped, however, that they may be\r\nbrought to realise that its surrender and the consequent improvement of\r\nGreco-Bulgarian relations are in the highest interests of Greece and the\r\nwhole Hellenic race. Here again, the break-up of the Turkish Empire may\r\nenable the Greeks to compensate themselves on the shores of Asia Minor. But\r\nthe real key to the problem of Kavala, and thus indirectly to the revival\r\nof the Balkan League and all the far-reaching effects which that would have\r\nupon the fate of Europe, lies in the hands of Britain. It could instantly\r\nbe solved by the cession of Cyprus to Greece, on condition that Kavala and\r\nthe valley of the Strymon were restored to Bulgaria. Neither strategically\r\nnor economically is Cyprus of any value to Britain; thirty-five years ago\r\nit was taken over by Disraeli \"as a sort of fee for opposing Russia,\" a\r\nfoolish habit which we had abandoned long before the present war with\r\nTurkey. Its population is predominantly Greek, and the Hellenic national\r\nmovement is steadily gaining ground. Anything that we might gain by its\r\nretention is more than counterbalanced by its value as an instrument of\r\nbarter.\r\n\r\n\r\n§13. _The Future of Turkey._--The entry of Turkey into the great war\r\nmarks a further stage in the winnowing process from which we hope that a\r\nregenerated Europe will emerge. Two of the main causes of the war are the\r\nTurk and the Magyar, whose effete and tyrannous systems have each in its\r\nown manner and degree long kept South-Eastern Europe in a ferment of unrest\r\nand reaction. It is a matter of profound regret that two infinitely more\r\nvirile and progressive races, the German and the Jew, should be fighting\r\ntheir battles for them, and indeed bolstering up causes which would\r\notherwise speedily collapse by reason of their own inward rottenness. It is\r\nthe Triple Alliance which has made it possible for the iniquitous racial\r\nhegemony of the Magyars to survive in Hungary; it is the joint policy of\r\nVienna, Budapest, and Berlin which has hampered the progress of the Balkan\r\nStates, and above all the development of every Slavonic nation; and in this\r\ntheir most valuable allies have been the Jewish Press and the Jewish _haute\r\nfinance_ of Germany, Austria and Hungary. Just as we hope and believe that\r\none result of this war will be the emancipation of Germany and German\r\n\"culture\" from the corroding influences of militarist doctrine, so there\r\nare good grounds for hoping that it will also give a new and healthy\r\nimpetus to Jewish national policy, grant freer play to their many splendid\r\nqualities, and enable them to shake off the false shame which has led\r\nmen who ought to be proud of their Jewish race to assume so many alien\r\ndisguises and to accuse of anti-Semitism those who refuse to be deceived\r\nby mere appearances. It is high time that the Jews should realise that few\r\nthings do more to foster anti-Semite feeling than this very tendency to\r\nsail under false colours and conceal their true identity. The Zionist\r\nand the orthodox Jewish nationalist have long ago won the respect and\r\nadmiration of the world. No race has ever defied assimilation so stubbornly\r\nand so successfully, and the modern tendency of individual Jews to\r\nrepudiate what is one of their chief glories suggests an almost comic\r\nresolve to fight against the course of nature.\r\n\r\nThese cryptic tendencies of pseudo-national as opposed to national Judaism\r\nhave played a great part in the Young Turkish movement and the destruction\r\nwhich it is bringing upon Turkey. The Committee of Union and Progress at\r\nfirst enjoyed the moral and financial support of many men, both Christians\r\nand Jews, to whom its methods and secret currents were a sealed book. For\r\na time the Young Turks, like the Magyars farther west, deceived foreign\r\nopinion by claptrap phrases from the repertory of modern democracy. But\r\n\"murder will out,\" and the Committee--despite the tiny group of able, and\r\nin certain cases honourable, men who control its destinies--has gradually\r\nbeen revealed in its true colours, as a parasitic growth upon the body\r\npolitic, preserving the worst faults of the old régime and blending with it\r\nmuch of the decadence which lies like froth along the backwaters of Western\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\nSince 1908, then, the fate of Turkey has passed from the control of the\r\nTurk and is being decided by an alien clique of infidels, renegades,\r\npolitical freemasons[1] and Jews, in whose hands the Caliph is a helpless\r\ntool, and to whom the teachings of Christ and of Mohammed are mere worn-out\r\nsuperstitions. In fact, the Committee is in its essence non-Turkish\r\nand non-Moslem. In the name of a secret society, based openly upon the\r\nsubversive ideas of the wilder French Jacobins, and not shrinking from\r\nassassination as a convenient political weapon, a Jehad or Holy War is to\r\nbe preached against the British Empire, and the most sacred interests of\r\nIslam are to be exploited in the interests of Germany. What bitter irony is\r\nin the fact that William II., who risked universal war to avenge the murder\r\nof his friend, the Archduke Francis Ferdinand, should now find himself\r\nclosely allied with Enver Pasha, the military adventurer who barely two\r\nyears ago foully assassinated his own commander-in-chief, Nazim Pasha, and\r\nwho therefore represents everything that is anathema to the Prussian\r\nWar Lord with his exaggerated ideas of military discipline and personal\r\nloyalty!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Not to be confused for a moment with the very different form\r\nof freemasonry which prevails in this country.]\r\n\r\nThe die has been cast, and even those who most regret Turkey's action\r\ncannot shut their eyes to the fact that it inevitably raises the whole\r\nquestion of Constantinople and the Dardanelles. If Germany should emerge\r\nvictorious, Turkey is likely to fall under a more or less veiled German\r\nprotectorate. In the event of the victory of the Allies, Turkey may\r\ncontinue to exist as an Asiatic power, but there is little doubt that\r\nshe will be eliminated from Europe. The only real question is, Who is to\r\nreplace her? Bulgaria will, it is to be hoped, recover Adrianople and the\r\nEnos-Midia line, of which she was so cruelly robbed last year. The fact\r\nthat the Turks on their re-entry systematically wiped out the entire\r\nBulgarian population of northern Thrace does not weaken, but enormously\r\nstrengthens, the case for its restoration. But to offer Constantinople to\r\nBulgaria would be a fatal gift. She has absolutely no historic claim to\r\nthe great city of the Caesars (Tsarigrad, as it is rightly known to every\r\nSlav); nor is there even any considerable Bulgarian population which could\r\nrally round the new government. The administrative task is obviously far\r\nbeyond the powers of a small peasant state, most of whose present leaders\r\nwere born under a foreign yoke. Nor is Greece a serious candidate for the\r\nvacant post. The Greeks, of course, unlike the Bulgarians, have a definite\r\nclaim, based on the traditions of the Byzantine Empire, and there is a\r\nlarge Greek population in the city--at present close upon 350,000, though\r\ntheir numbers are likely to be materially reduced before this war is over.\r\nBut in their case also Constantinople would be a fatal gift. The resources\r\neven of the enlarged Hellenic kingdom would inevitably prove unequal to the\r\ntask. Moreover, it must not be forgotten that a Greek occupation would be\r\nopposed on many grounds by the entire commercial community of every other\r\nnation in Europe.\r\n\r\nIn some ways the ideal arrangement would be that Roumania should assume the\r\nadministration of the city, as trustee for a reconstituted Balkan League,\r\nwith proper guarantees for the commercial rights of all the Powers. But it\r\nis to be feared that such a solution would please nobody, perhaps not even\r\nRoumania herself. A league of the five Balkan kings, with Roumania as\r\n_primus inter pares_, is the dream of a remote future, and until it can be\r\nrealised, Constantinople cannot assume its natural position as capital of\r\nthe Balkan peninsula.\r\n\r\n\r\n§14. _Russia and Constantinople._--In short, as matters stand to-day, there\r\nis only one power which can replace the Turks as master of Constantinople,\r\nand that power is Russia. The Russians could not of course incorporate the\r\ncity in their empire for reasons of geography; and this fundamental fact\r\ndestroys at a blow the numerous objections which might have told against\r\nthe occupation, if Constantinople had been contiguous to the Russian\r\ndominions. It would obviously be necessary to establish a special\r\nautonomous administration under a Russian governor. It is by no means\r\nimpossible that Russia would be satisfied with the expulsion of the Turks\r\nand the internationalisation of Constantinople as a free port under a\r\nChristian prince or a commission of the Powers. But, though admirable\r\nin theory, such a solution would give rise to endless complications and\r\ndisputes. Unless the Western Powers can trust Russia sufficiently to leave\r\nher in full possession, they must make up their minds to bolstering up the\r\nimpossible Turk for a further period of years. Such a surrender to the\r\nunreasoning and ignorant prejudices of a previous generation would be a\r\nsure prelude to the collapse of our alliance with Russia, which it is the\r\nvital interest of all British patriots to uphold at all costs. Happily,\r\n\"the fear of Russia,\" as of a strange and unknown colossus, is dying out,\r\nvague fancies inevitably yielding to the hard logic of facts. The Disraeli\r\npolicy in the Near East must give place once and for all to the broader\r\nconceptions of Gladstone, tempered by the cautious statesmanship of\r\nSalisbury. The greatest of the Christian Powers must be allowed to replace\r\nthe cross upon the dome of Saint Sofia. The religious appeal of such a\r\nchange is clear enough, nor need there be any anxiety on economic grounds.\r\nThere is nothing to prevent Constantinople from becoming a free port under\r\nthe Russian flag, and filling a similar place to that which the free port\r\nof Trieste would occupy under the flag of United Italy. Indeed it may be\r\nconfidently assumed that the change would give an extraordinary impetus to\r\ntrade in the whole eastern Mediterranean. The recent history of Batum and\r\nBaku is a faint indication of what might be expected.\r\n\r\nThe fate of the Dardanelles cannot be separated from that of the capital;\r\nboth must be in the same hands. At the same time a reasonable compensation\r\nfor their cession to Russia would be the dismantlement of their forts. In\r\nany case, whatever their fate may be, it is clear that an end must be put\r\nto the galling restrictions upon Russia's Black Sea fleet. The essential\r\npoint to bear in mind is that if the war goes well with the Allies, and\r\nif Russia expresses a definite desire to occupy Constantinople and the\r\nstraits, resistance on our part would be alike difficult, pointless, and\r\nundesirable. Those who oppose have no arguments, so long as the special\r\ninternational needs and conditions of the city are properly recognised and\r\nguaranteed. With true Oriental fatalism, the Turk has always regarded his\r\nultimate disappearance from Europe as a certainty; the superstition which\r\nled the inhabitants of Stamboul to prefer burial across the straits in Asia\r\nhas its parallel in the alarm aroused in the bazaars by the Young Turks'\r\ndecision to exterminate the pariah dogs which have for centuries supplied\r\nthe place of scavengers in the streets of the capital. To-day the prophecy\r\nwhich made their removal the prelude to the departure of their masters\r\nseems on the point of fulfillment, and all who believe in the retributive\r\njustice of history will re-echo Mr. Asquith's hope that the fall of Ottoman\r\nrule will remove \"the blight which for generations has withered some of the\r\nfairest regions of the world.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§15. _Asiatic Turkey._--What then will be the subsequent fate of the Turks\r\nif they are once driven \"bag and baggage\" across the straits. The Sultan\r\nwill doubtless transfer his capital to Brussa, or even to Konieh. But can\r\nthe Khalifate survive such a loss of prestige on the part of the Ottoman\r\ndynasty? It would be altogether premature to discuss in anything\r\napproaching detail the vast issues of the fate of Turkey's Asiatic\r\ndominions, but it is necessary to indicate that even after settling the\r\nfate of the straits we shall still be confronted by issues of appalling\r\nmagnitude. It is the conjunction of the spiritual and temporal power in\r\na single person which has given the Khalifate its importance, and its\r\nexpulsion from the Golden Horn would transform its whole political status.\r\nAbove all, it is necessary to reckon with the Arab nationalist movement\r\nwhich is already a reality and a factor of permanent importance. Here, too,\r\nthe principle of nationality must be applied, though in a very different\r\nsense, for national feeling is of course at a much earlier stage of\r\ndevelopment among the Arabs than in Central Europe. Hitherto they have\r\naccepted the Khalifate of the House of Othman, though without enthusiasm;\r\nbut recent events are likely to bring to a head the resentment with which\r\nthey view the spectacle of the Khalif as the helpless tool of a clique\r\nwhich in no way represents Islam. Will they repudiate him and restore the\r\nKhalifate to some more authentic descendant of the Prophet? Is there to\r\nbe an independent Arab power? Will it be practicable to create a central\r\nauthority amid the virtual anarchy of so vast and primitive a country? Or\r\nwill Britain, as the chief Mahommedan power, be obliged to assume a loose\r\nprotectorate over Arabia and Mesopotamia? If so, will she share this with\r\nthe French in Syria, and will Lebanon be able to preserve its autonomy?\r\nOnly the course of events can provide an answer to such questions; only one\r\nfixed point emerges from the surrounding uncertainty--the firm pledge of\r\nthe British Government that the Holy Places of Islam shall be respected.\r\n\r\nEven this does not exhaust the possibilities of the immediate future. Is\r\nPalestine to become a Jewish land? In recent years there has been a\r\nsteady emigration of Moslem and Christian and an equally marked Jewish\r\nimmigration, and among other factors in the movement the potentialities of\r\nJewish nationalism in the United States deserve especial notice. America\r\nis full of nationalities which, while accepting with enthusiasm their new\r\nAmerican citizenship, none the less look to some centre in the Old World as\r\nthe source and inspiration of their national culture and traditions. The\r\nmost typical instance is the feeling of the American Jew for Palestine,\r\nwhich may well become a focus for his _déclassé_ kinsmen in other parts of\r\nthe world. The Jews quite realise that they can have no exclusive claim to\r\nthe possession of such a religious centre as Jerusalem, and it is clear\r\nthat whatever happens to the Holy Land as a whole, the city itself must\r\nbe subject to an impartial administration, which would be neither Jewish,\r\nCatholic, Orthodox, Protestant nor Moslem in any exclusive sense, but would\r\nsecure free play to the religious and educational aspirations of them all.\r\nHerzl himself, the founder of modern Zionism, dreamt of Jerusalem as the\r\nshrine of all religions and never looked forward to the day when it would\r\nbe a purely Jewish city.\r\n\r\nLastly, what is to be the fate of Asia Minor? There can be no question that\r\nthe Russians must be allowed to occupy and retain the whole of Turkish\r\nArmenia. They will thus be conferring a benefit upon humanity and ending\r\none of the most grinding and barbarous tyrannies that the modern world has\r\never seen; the progress made by the Armenians under Russian rule during the\r\npast twenty years is a happy augury for the future of this race when once\r\nunited in common allegiance to the Tsar, under a wise system of local\r\nautonomy. But will the Ottoman Empire be able to survive when shorn of its\r\nEuropean possessions, of its Armenian and Arab populations? Will not Italy\r\ndemand her share of the spoils, and side by side with the French in Syria,\r\nassume in friendly rivalry the protectorate of Cilicia from a point east of\r\nAdalia as far as the gulf of Alexandretta? Will it be possible to arrest\r\nthe process of disintegration even at this stage? Will not Greece attempt\r\nto annex Smyrna and at least a portion of its hinterland, or has she not\r\nat least as good a title as any other competitor? Here, again, it would\r\nbe absurd to attempt any answer for the present, but we must at least\r\nbe prepared for the possibility of a transformation as rapid and as\r\noverwhelming in Asiatic Turkey as that which freed the Balkans from the\r\nTurkish nightmare two short years ago. In Asia, as in Europe, the war is\r\nthe prelude to a new era, and Britain is faced with the alternative\r\nof weakly abandoning her Imperial mission or assuming still greater\r\nresponsibilities. \"The Turkish Empire has committed suicide, and dug with\r\nits own hand its grave,\" and to Britain will fall more fully than ever\r\nbefore the leadership of the Mahommedan world. The loyalty and devotion of\r\nthe Moslem community in India can best be repaid by the most scrupulous and\r\nsympathetic attention to the interests of Islam throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n§16. _Russia and Poland._--It is no mere accident that Germany,\r\nAustria-Hungary, and Turkey should be ranged on the same side in the great\r\nEuropean struggle; for they represent, each in its own way, those false\r\nconceptions of nationality which have so long envenomed the public life\r\nof Europe, and which, for want of better words, have been described as\r\nGermanisation, Magyarisation, and Turkification. It would, however, be\r\nflagrantly untrue to suggest that those three States enjoyed a monopoly of\r\nracial intolerance; for the ideas on nationality which dominated official\r\nRussia under the old absolutist régime and which so rapidly regained the\r\nupper hand under Stolypin and the triumphant bureaucracy, struck at the\r\nvery root of tolerance and political liberty. But recent years have\r\nrevealed a subtle change of attitude. The policy of Russification had not\r\nbeen abandoned; indeed in Finland and the Ukraine it survived in its most\r\nodious form. But it was none the less possible to detect a growing note\r\nof interrogation even among the bureaucracy, and still more an increasing\r\nmovement of impatient protest on the part of thinking Russians. Without in\r\nany way ignoring what has happened in Persia, we have every right to point\r\nto the essential fact that Russia has of her own accord raised the question\r\nof nationality and thus set in motion vast forces which are already shaking\r\nEurope to its foundations. In proclaiming as one of her foremost aims the\r\nrestoration of Polish Unity, Russia did not, it is true, commit herself to\r\nany concrete project of autonomy. But whether her action represents genuine\r\nfeeling on the part of the Tsar and his advisers, as M. Gabriel Hanotaux\r\nso positively asserts, or whether it was originally a mere manoeuvre to\r\nprevent the Polish question being raised against her, it is at least\r\ncertain that Russia has entered upon a new path from which it will be\r\nvery difficult if not impossible to recede. The Russian Poles, under the\r\nleadership of M. Dmowski, have rallied loyally round the Tsar; and there\r\nare many signs that the long-deferred Russo-Polish _rapprochement_ is at\r\nlength on the point of fulfillment. Here economic interests play their\r\npart, for in recent years the district between Warsaw and Lodz has become\r\none of the chief industrial centres of the Russian Empire, and its\r\nannexation to Austria or to Prussia would place a tariff wall between it\r\nand the South Russian markets upon which it chiefly depends. The Poles\r\nof Galicia, having enjoyed the utmost liberty under Austrian rule, have\r\nnaturally been almost immune from the discontent so noticeable among their\r\nkinsmen in Russia and Prussia, and have indeed for a generation past formed\r\nthe backbone of all parliamentary majorities in the Austrian Reichsrat.\r\nBut even among them the first faint signs of Russophil feeling have\r\nbeen noticeable in the last two years. This is partially due to the\r\nencouragement given by the Austrian Government to the Ruthenes in Galicia,\r\nbut also to the disintegrating effect of universal suffrage upon the Polish\r\npolitical parties, the growth of democratic tendencies at the expense of\r\nthe Austrophil nobility, and the consequent increased influence of the\r\nPoles of Warsaw. Though the Polish parties in Galicia issued declarations\r\nof loyalty to Austria at the beginning of the war, and though their\r\n_franc-tireurs_ are fighting in the Austrian ranks, there is a growing\r\nperception of the fact that the only serious prospect of attaining Polish\r\nUnity lies in a Russian victory. Austria, they argue, might, if successful,\r\nunite the Russian and Austrian sections (at the expense of the former's\r\neconomic future!), but never the Prussian; and Prussia, out of loyalty to\r\nher ally, could at best add _Russian_ Poland to her own territory: Russia\r\nalone can hope, in the event of a victory, to unite all three fragments in\r\na single whole. However profoundly they may differ on points of detail,\r\nall Poles agree that the first essential is the attainment of that unity\r\nwithout which they may at any moment become, as now, the battleground of\r\nthree great Empires, and which provides the key with which they themselves\r\ncan unlock the portals of their future destiny. Should their dream be\r\nfulfilled, the valley of the Vistula, restored to geographical unity, may\r\nsoon play an important part in the political and economic life of Europe.\r\n\r\nRussia, then, is faced by one of the greatest choices in history. An\r\nopportunity will present itself after this war, for solving her own racial\r\nquestion which has in the past presented scarcely less grave embarrassment\r\nthan the parallel problem of Austria-Hungary, and which, if left unsolved,\r\nmay at no distant date endanger the unity and welfare of the Empire. The\r\ngrant of Polish autonomy, the restoration of the Finnish constitution, the\r\nrecognition of the special position of the Ukraine or Ruthene language and\r\ncultural traditions, the relaxation of linguistic restrictions among the\r\nlesser races of the Empire, and the adoption of a humaner attitude towards\r\nthe Jews of the Pale--these are steps which follow logically from the\r\nproclamation of the Grand Duke Nicholas, and indeed from the alliance with\r\nthe Western Powers. Incidentally much will depend upon the attitude adopted\r\nby the Russian Government towards its new Catholic subjects. Its relations\r\nwith the Vatican will require to be placed upon an entirely new footing,\r\nand due respect must be accorded to the Uniate Catholic Church of the four\r\nmillion Ruthenes of Galicia. In this respect the Concordat signed a few\r\nweeks before the outbreak of war between Serbia and the Vatican should form\r\na very valuable precedent for the whole future relations of the Catholic\r\nand Orthodox Churches, relations which are likely to assume increasing\r\nimportance in the not too far distant future. And here it is worth while to\r\nemphasise, for the benefit of those who still regard Russia with misgiving\r\nor dislike, the indisputable fact that it is just the most democratic and\r\nenlightened of the smaller Slavonic States, and the most intellectual and\r\nenlightened politicians and thinkers in those States, who have always\r\nlooked with the greatest confidence and enthusiasm to Russia, and who\r\nto-day are most unanimous in welcoming her as the herald of a new era of\r\nhumanity and progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n§17. _General Aims._--It would lead us much too far afield to consider\r\nthe possible effects of the war upon colonial development and upon the\r\npolitical and commercial development of the Far East. Here again, the\r\ncentral fact to remember is that we may, indeed, that we must, defeat\r\nGermany or perish in the attempt, but that a nation of 65 million\r\ninhabitants cannot be effaced or permanently reduced to impotence. After\r\nthe war the two nations will have to live peaceably side by side once more,\r\nand repair so far as possible the wreckage to which this gigantic struggle\r\nhas reduced their political, social, and commercial intercourse. Any peace\r\nsettlement will be good only so far as it avoids placing obstacles in the\r\npath of so difficult an achievement. It will be the first duty of our\r\nstatesmen to watch over the alliance between Russia and the Western Powers,\r\nsealed as it is by the fiery ordeal of war, and to neutralise the occult\r\ninfluences which are even now working to undermine it, to the advantage of\r\ninterests which are anything but British. But it will also be their duty to\r\ncreate a situation which, while safeguarding the Empire's vital interests,\r\nshall not render improved relations with the central European Powers\r\nimpossible from the very outset. It is one thing to abandon our allies\r\nand friends, it is quite another thing to perpetuate a feud which, though\r\nconverted by circumstances into a struggle between two unanimous nations,\r\nwas in the first instance the work of mischievous if powerful minorities.\r\n\r\nThe final settlement will inevitably bring many disappointments and\r\nerrors in its train. We can best guard against such a result by preparing\r\nourselves for all eventualities and giving the most careful consideration\r\nto each of the many problems at issue. Our obvious aim must be a settlement\r\nwhich shows some reasonable prospect of permanence, and this can best be\r\nachieved if we respect so far as possible the wishes of the populations\r\nconcerned. The principle of Nationality is not a talisman which will\r\nopen all gates, for in some parts of Europe the different races are so\r\ninextricably intermingled as to defy all efforts to create ethnographic\r\nboundaries. This does not, however, affect the central fact that\r\nNationality is the best salve for existing wounds, and that its application\r\nwill enormously reduce the infected area. But if the peoples are to make\r\ntheir wishes felt there must be a regeneration of diplomatic methods\r\nthroughout Europe. Attempts will be made to revive the pernicious\r\nprinciples of the Congress of Vienna, by which a few autocrats and\r\naristocrats carved out the fate of millions according to their dynastic\r\nappetites or fancies, and thus tied a whole series of unnecessary knots for\r\nsubsequent wars to sever. A healthy and informed public opinion--especially\r\nin the West--must watch over the doings of those who represent it at the\r\nfateful Congress, according loyal support to their declared policy, but\r\npromptly checking the reactionary tendencies which are certain to reveal\r\nthemselves. It is still unhappily possible for the arrogant impatience of\r\na single ruler or the persistent intrigue and misrepresentation of an\r\nambassador to embroil the European situation. Unless the nations in council\r\ncan devise some practical checks upon irresponsible meddling, the flower of\r\ntheir manhood will have massacred each other in vain. The antecedents of\r\nSir Edward Grey, and more especially his attitude during the crisis which\r\nled to war, justify us in the hope that his entire influence will be\r\nemployed in the right direction when the decisive moment arrives, and that\r\nhe will insist upon such crucial questions as the reduction of armaments,\r\nthe substitution of \"citizen\" for \"conscript\" armies, the control of\r\narmament firms and their occult influence, the effective extension of\r\narbitration and the elimination of impossible time-limits, being discussed\r\nin all seriousness, and not merely dismissed with a few ironic platitudes\r\nand expressions of hypocritical goodwill. We must not be unduly discouraged\r\nif some of these ideals prove impossible of realisation, for it would be\r\nchildish to suppose that when the great war is over the nations will at\r\nonce convert their swords into ploughshares and proclaim for the first time\r\nin history the sway of Right over Might. But it is obvious that in a world\r\nwhich has long ceased to be merely European, the European Powers cannot\r\nlong continue with impunity such internecine strife, and that unless some\r\nreal shape and substance can be given to the Concert of Europe--so long and\r\nso justly a byword among all thinking men--our continent (and with it these\r\nislands) will inevitably forfeit the leadership which has hitherto been\r\ntheirs and surrender the direction of the world's affairs into the hands of\r\nthe extra-European powers. It will be remembered that Sir Edward Grey, in\r\na last despairing effort to preserve peace,[1] broached the idea of \"some\r\nmore definite rapprochement between the Powers,\" and though admittedly\r\n\"hitherto too Utopian to form the subject of definite proposals,\" it may\r\nbe hoped that the enormous difficulty of the task will not deter him from\r\npleading before the future Congress the outraged cause of international\r\ngoodwill.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: White Paper, No. 101.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSOCIAL AND ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n\"And the economic ravages of war are also much greater with civilised\r\nnations than with barbarians. A war nowadays may have stern, fearful\r\nconsequences, especially through the destruction of the ingenious credit\r\nsystem.\"--TREITSCHKE.\r\n\r\n\"Those who have fallen have consecrated deaths. They have taken their part\r\nin the making of a new Europe, a new world. I can see signs of its coming\r\nin the glare of the battlefield. The people will gain more by this struggle\r\nin all lands than they comprehend at the present moment.... A great flood\r\nof luxury and of sloth which had submerged the land is receding, and a new\r\nBritain is appearing. We can see for the first time the fundamental things\r\nthat matter in life and that have been obscured from our vision by the\r\ntropical growth of prosperity.\"--MR.D. LLOYD GEORGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that a great war must profoundly disturb every side of the\r\nnational life of the peoples taking part in it, and that these disturbances\r\nmust react upon neutral States. The exact character and extent of these\r\nchanges, however, are by no means easy to understand, and the present\r\nchapter does not pretend to offer an exhaustive treatment of them. It is\r\nimpossible to appreciate the full significance of the immediate social and\r\neconomic reactions of the war, whilst an attempt to state the ultimate\r\neffects of the war leads us along the slippery paths of prophecy.\r\nNevertheless, we are not likely to grasp the importance of the various\r\nphenomena which have followed so closely upon the heels of the declaration\r\nof war, nor to adapt ourselves to the new situation which will arise out\r\nof the war, unless we give our attention to the things which are happening\r\naround us.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately we can gain little guidance from the past. The South African\r\nWar inevitably disturbed the normal course of our industrial life, but it\r\ninvolved us in conflict with a nation of relatively little general economic\r\nimportance; and so, costly and prolonged though it was, it bears no\r\ncomparison in its magnitude and in the character of its main issues to the\r\npresent war in Europe. The Crimean War of sixty years ago, though waged\r\nbetween four European nations--Great Britain, France, Turkey, and\r\nRussia--cost Great Britain much less in money than the Boer War; the issues\r\nso far as this country was concerned were not so momentous; and industry\r\nand commerce, though important, were not then nearly so highly developed\r\nand complicated as they are now. The Napoleonic wars, though comparable to\r\nthe present war in fundamental importance, lasted for a generation, which\r\nthe war of to-day can hardly do; the effects of the wars with Napoleon were\r\ncomplicated by the Industrial Revolution; the industrial system and the\r\ncommercial fabric erected on it were then only in process of formation and\r\nthe power of the people was small.\r\n\r\nThese differences enable us to see the new factors which have come into\r\nplay during the past century. The present war is being fought\r\nunder conditions which were non-existent during the struggle with\r\nNapoleon--conditions which on the one hand add to the waste and loss and\r\nmisery of war, but on the other give rise to the hope that many of its evil\r\nconsequences may be averted. Firstly, industry and commerce are world-wide;\r\nthe remotest countries are bound together by economic ties; invisible\r\ncords link the Belgian iron worker with the London docker and the Clyde\r\nshipwright, the Californian fruit grower with the Malay tin miner and the\r\nGerman dye worker. The economic effects of modern warfare, therefore,\r\nreverberate throughout the whole world, and widespread dislocation ensues.\r\nIn the next place, the gigantic scale on which war between great powers is\r\nconducted, though it tends to shorten the duration of wars, increases the\r\nintensity of the shock to human society.\r\n\r\nBut besides these new material conditions, modern warfare is carried on\r\nunder the eyes of more enlightened peoples than in the past. The struggle\r\nwhich is now being pursued is the first great war watched by a conscious or\r\nat any rate partly conscious democracy. It is the first modern war waged\r\n(except in our own case) by national armies constituting practically the\r\nentire fit male population. The masses of the people have in most civilised\r\ncountries some measure of political power. And though to the elector\r\ndiplomacy and the conduct of foreign affairs are a closed book, war once\r\ndeclared is war by the people; and their voice must be heard in matters\r\nconnected with it and arising out of it. Then, further, in the past the\r\naftermath of war was in many ways as horrible as war itself, whilst the\r\nperiod during war witnessed an enormous amount of privation and suffering\r\namong non-combatants almost as ghastly as that of the battlefield. This was\r\ndue not so much to inaction resulting from callousness as to unwise action\r\nand ignorance. During the past century political science and economic\r\ninquiry have made vast strides, and consequently the injurious social\r\neffects of warfare may be minimised, though not averted; and a considerable\r\nbody of public opinion, far more enlightened than during any previous\r\nEuropean war, is almost certain to exercise some pressure in the direction\r\nof wise and far-reaching action both during the war and after it is ended.\r\nThese considerations must be borne in mind in discussing both the present\r\nposition and possible future developments.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that four great European Powers and some smaller ones cannot\r\nengage in war without shaking the fabric of European civilisation to its\r\nfoundations. The tramp of fifteen million armed men is the greatest social\r\nand economic fact of the present day, and indeed of the present generation.\r\nThese millions of combatants have to be clothed, fed, armed, transported,\r\nand tended in health and in sickness; they are non-producers for the time,\r\nconsuming in large quantities the staple commodities of life, and calling\r\nin addition for all the paraphernalia of war; sooner or later, they will\r\ndesire to return to the plough and the mine, the factory and the railroad.\r\nThese two facts alone are of tremendous importance. But besides this,\r\nthe activity of those who stay at home is called into play in a thousand\r\ndifferent ways, and economic and social life leave their well-trodden paths\r\nin answer to the imperious call of national necessity. Social institutions\r\nof all kinds are inevitably led into new fields of thought and action, and\r\nStates are driven to untried experiments in communal activity. The usual\r\nchannels of thought dry up, the flood of new ideas and of old ideas\r\nthrobbing with a new life rushes on unconfined, here in the shallows, there\r\nin the deeps, presently to overflow into the old channels, cleansing their\r\nbeds and giving them a new direction, and linking up in fruitful union but\r\nremotely connected streams. When fighting ceases and there comes the calm\r\nof peace, society will tend to revert to its normal functions, based on\r\npeace; but the society of yesterday can never return. Social life cannot be\r\nthe same as it was before, not merely because those activities called forth\r\nby the war may persist in some form, but because of the growth of new ideas\r\nunder the stimulus of the war. The struggle will almost certainly set in\r\nprogress trains of thought not only connected with questions of war and\r\npeace, but with the wider questions of human destiny.\r\n\r\nComing to a closer view of the question, we must distinguish between the\r\nimmediate effects of the war which are already in evidence and the ultimate\r\neffects which will but begin to unfold themselves after the return of\r\npeace. Some of the latter results will grow out of the immediate effects;\r\nothers will be more directly due to the events following on the conclusion\r\nof the war. It will also be advisable to distinguish between the economic\r\nreactions of the war, and the broader social consequences. At such an\r\nearly stage it would be presumptuous and tempting Providence to attempt to\r\nforecast the future in any detail or to try to trace the play and interplay\r\nof the various forces going towards the making of the future. This chapter\r\nwill be concerned with broad tentative generalisations on quite simple\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nOne of the things which struck the intelligent working man during the early\r\ndays of the war was the rapidity with which the State acted in the face of\r\nthe crisis. In next to no time large measures of State control and\r\naction were put successfully into operation and those who had advocated\r\nco-operative action in the past with but indifferent success were amazed\r\nat the swiftness with which the nation can act in the hour of need. The\r\ndrastic action of the State cannot be better illustrated than by the steps\r\nwhich were taken to meet the sudden commercial deadlock which the war\r\nprecipitated. A discussion of these financial measures will at the same\r\ntime enable us to understand how, through credit, war strikes at the\r\nindustry and trade of the modern world.\r\n\r\n\r\nA. STATE ACTION IN INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE\r\n\r\nThe Austrian ultimatum to Servia was followed by the paralysis of the\r\nworld's international system of finance. Before the end of July many\r\nimportant stock exchanges were closed, and by the 31st the London Stock\r\nExchange for the first time in its history was also compelled to close. The\r\nremittance market collapsed and with it the fabric of international trade.\r\nWidespread bankruptcy and ruin seemed imminent; so serious did the state of\r\naffairs become that moratoria were declared not only in several European\r\ncountries but in parts of America, and in many continental countries specie\r\npayments were suspended. In a word, the possibility of war had thrown the\r\ndelicately poised credit system of the commercial world out of gear; the\r\ndeclaration of war had brought it to a standstill. Into an explanation of\r\nits working it is not possible to enter; it is sufficient for our immediate\r\npurpose to realise that the foreign exchange machinery by which the supply\r\nof commodities from other countries becomes practicable on a large scale\r\nwas for a time altogether unworkable. London as the financial centre of the\r\nworld has immense sums owing to it and in its turn owes large sums. The\r\nultimate effect of the collapse of credit, which depends on confidence, was\r\nthat London could neither receive nor make payment. The big finance houses,\r\nwho had \"accepted\" bills of exchange and rendered themselves liable to meet\r\nthe payments for the things they represented, on the understanding that the\r\nmeans to pay them were to be promptly despatched, found that these means\r\nwere not forthcoming; their own resources were far from sufficient to meet\r\nthese payments. Utter ruin stared them in the face. At home also a run on\r\nthe banks seemed probable, which would have meant ruin to large numbers of\r\npeople. In this grave crisis the State acted with commendable promptness.\r\nThe bank holiday was extended; State notes for 10s. and £1 were issued; a\r\nmoratorium was declared, legalising the postponement of the due payment of\r\ndebts, with certain exceptions; the Bank of England under a guarantee from\r\nthe Government that the latter would meet the loss, began discounting,\r\nor buying for cash, approved bills of exchange accepted before war was\r\ndeclared, many of which are hardly likely to be met by the people liable\r\nfor payment. These steps were taken swiftly and boldly and allayed the\r\npanic. But more was needed; such measures were not in themselves sufficient\r\nto put the machinery of foreign exchange into operation again and the\r\nsuspension of this method of settling international indebtedness was having\r\nserious effects. To carry on international trade, and to supply ourselves\r\nwith the produce on which the very existence of the community depends,\r\nwithout the machinery, is a thousand times more difficult than to conduct\r\nour home trade by means of direct barter. Without going into technical\r\ndetails, it may be said that the purchase of bills by the Bank of England,\r\nwhilst relieving the last holder from loss, did not extinguish the\r\nliability of persons whose names had appeared on the bills as acceptors,\r\nendorsers and drawers. This was true of traders and commercial people not\r\nonly in this country but also in other parts of the world. In the face of\r\nthese liabilities, in most cases unexpected, it was hardly likely that\r\nthey would increase their liabilities under new bills. Consequently the\r\nremittances coming to London shrank to next to nothing. As bills of\r\nexchange--or their equivalent--are the means by which both importers\r\nand exporters get paid for their goods, the difficulty of getting paid\r\nnaturally began to have a serious effect on trade. As the figures of\r\nforeign trade during August show, cargoes were being held up. It was clear,\r\ntherefore, that if this country were to continue to receive supplies of\r\ncorn and meat, of cotton and wool, of hides and timber, something further\r\nmust be done. The question the Government had to decide was what steps\r\ncould be taken to safeguard the food of the people, and to avoid a crushing\r\nvolume of unemployment through the lack of the raw materials of industry.\r\nThe produce was there; what was needed was to start the flow of the\r\nparticular kind of currency--\"credit money\"--which would expedite exchange.\r\nThe course taken by the State was to advance money to the large bill\r\nbankers or \"accepting houses\" in London to allow of the due payment of the\r\nenormous number of bills falling due in the three months succeeding the\r\noutbreak of war. The audacity of the step will be understood when it is\r\nrealised that probably something like £300,000,000 of bills fall due over a\r\nperiod of three months.[1] The necessary money was lent without security,\r\nthe Government promising not to demand repayment until twelve months after\r\nthe end of the war. A proportion of this advance will be in the nature of\r\na loss, though how much it is quite impossible to say. By this measure,\r\nin the event of the bills not being met by those who have promised to pay\r\nthem--the acceptors--the liability which would ordinarily have fallen upon\r\nthe drawers and endorsers through whose hands the bills had passed has been\r\nremoved. The State has advanced to the commercial community a huge sum of\r\nmoney, risking the total loss of some part of it, in order to set in motion\r\nthe machinery of international exchange. Further steps, however, were\r\ntaken. The general moratorium expired on November 4. Useful as it had\r\nbeen, it still left many traders in financial difficulties because of\r\nthe impossibility of collecting debts owing to them in enemy and other\r\ncountries. The Government, therefore, appointed a committee representing\r\nthe Treasury, the Bank of England, the Joint Stock Banks, and the\r\nAssociation of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom to authorise\r\nadvances in approved cases to British traders carrying on an export\r\nbusiness in respect of debts outstanding in foreign countries and colonies,\r\nincluding unpaid foreign and colonial accepted bills which cannot be\r\ncollected for the time being. It is safe to say that no Government ever\r\ntook such gigantic measures to meet a great crisis.[2] The Prime Minister,\r\nspeaking at the Guildhall on November 9, 1914, summarised as follows the\r\neffects of the steps taken: \"The foreign exchanges are working in the case\r\nof most countries quite satisfactorily, and the gold reserves at the Bank\r\nof England, which were 40 millions on July 22, and which had fallen on\r\nAugust 7 to 27 millions, now stand at the unprecedented figure of 69-1/2\r\nmillions. The central gold reserve of the country after three months of the\r\nwar amounts to £80,000,000, almost exactly twice the amount at which it\r\nstood at the beginning of the crisis. The bank rate, which rose, as you\r\nknow, to 10 per cent, has now come down to 5, a figure, I think, not in\r\nexcess of that at which it stood this time last year. Food prices have been\r\nkept at a fairly normal level, and though trade has been curtailed in some\r\ndirections, unemployment has been rather below than above the average.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. J.M. Keynes (_Economic Journal,_ Sept. 1914) estimates the\r\naggregate value of outstanding bills in London at £350,000,000.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In addition to these various financial measures, the State has\r\nlent Belgium £10,000,000 and the Union of South Africa £7,000,000, whilst\r\nit has also guaranteed £5,000,000 of the new Egyptian cotton loan.]\r\n\r\nBut this is by no means the only example of State action. The Government\r\nhas established temporarily a State-aided system of marine insurance, by\r\nundertaking 80 per cent of the war risk, in order to encourage overseas\r\ntrade. It has given substantial aid to the joint-stock banks \"for the sole\r\npurpose that they might be fit to aid in every way possible the country's\r\ntrade and finance.\"[1] It made arrangements for the direct purchase of\r\nforage and vegetables, etc., from farmers.[2] It took over the control of\r\nthe railways. When, owing to panic, there was a rush for the purchase of\r\nfood-stuffs, which was used to force up prices unduly, the Government\r\nintervened to prevent exorbitant charges. Particularly interesting is the\r\naction of the State regarding sugar, two-thirds of our supply of which\r\ncomes from Germany and Austria. In the days immediately following the\r\ndeclaration of war wholesale prices were trebled. The Government,\r\ntherefore, decided to take upon itself the task of ensuring an adequate\r\nsupply of sugar, and a Royal Commission was appointed. The leading refiners\r\nwere approached and an arrangement was made with the whole body of refiners\r\nthat they should stand aside from the market for raw sugars, leaving it\r\nfree for the operations of the Government. The Royal Commission pledged the\r\nrefiners to buy their sugar from the Commission, _i.e._ from the State;\r\nsugar was to be offered to them at a fixed price, and the refiners were to\r\nsell the refined product to the dealers also at a fixed price sufficient to\r\nyield the refiners a fair profit on manufacture. As a result of the corner,\r\na big rise in the price of sugar, which is not only an important domestic\r\ncommodity but the raw material of several industries, was averted. This\r\nmerits the description given of it in _The Nation_--\"a really dashing\r\nexperiment in State Socialism.\" [3] On the other hand, it has done nothing\r\nto increase the world's supply of sugar, but has merely commandeered a\r\npart of the existing stock. The aid of the State has been invoked in other\r\ndirections. Already the Government has assisted experimental cultivation of\r\nbeet in this country. The suggestion has been made that the State should\r\nbuild two beet-sugar factories, which would cost about £200,000 each; in\r\nthis way it is suggested that our home supply of sugar would in the future\r\nbe assured, and that agriculture would benefit considerably.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Round Table_, Sept. 1914, p. 705.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This was done through the Board of Agriculture for the War\r\nOffice. On the other hand, in the purchase of clothing, boots, blankets,\r\netc., the War Office approached the producers directly instead of through\r\nthe Board of Trade.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: It was reported in the Press on October 8, 1914, that the Home\r\nSecretary had purchased 900,000 tons of sugar at about £20 per ton, the\r\ntransaction involving an outlay of about £18,000,000.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: See an article by Mr. Robertson Scott in _The Nineteenth\r\nCentury_, October 1914.]\r\n\r\nSir Charles Macara has put forward a scheme of State aid for the cotton\r\nindustry. Owing to the war, a third of the total cotton crop (usually taken\r\nby the continental countries) was thrown on the market. Prices naturally\r\nfell, and there was a danger that the cotton planters might not be able to\r\npay the debts they had contracted to enable them to grow their crops, in\r\nwhich case there would be a likelihood of the land being used for other\r\nsaleable commodities, and the efforts which have been made in the past to\r\nincrease the cotton crop would be nullified. In the meantime, the surplus\r\ncotton on the market created an uncertainty regarding prices, and buying\r\ncame to a standstill, with the result that the position of the industry as\r\na whole became very critical. The suggestion of Sir Charles Macara is\r\nthat the Governments of this country and the United States, acting in\r\nconjunction, should take the temporarily unsaleable surplus of raw cotton\r\noff the market and store it for use in years when the crop is short. In\r\nother words, it is proposed to establish a permanent national cotton\r\nreserve. It is estimated that the cost of the scheme would mean an outlay\r\nof sixty to seventy millions sterling. If the plan were put into operation,\r\nhowever, it is claimed that it would restore confidence, prevent the\r\nwholesale stoppage of mills, and at the same time establish a cotton\r\nreserve to counteract the fluctuations of crops in the future.[1] These\r\nmatters need but to be stated as examples of the remarkable adaptability\r\nof the State and the possibility of drastic action under the pressure of\r\nimperative needs.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It should be pointed out that the serious condition of the\r\ncotton industry is not due to the war. The overstocking of the Eastern and\r\nIndian markets during the trade boom of 1913, together with the financial\r\ncrisis in India last year, has reduced the demand for cotton goods. The\r\nwar has merely emphasised a depression which had already fallen on the\r\nindustry. Sir Charles Macara's scheme, whilst it may be desirable on other\r\ngrounds, cannot compensate for the shrinkage in the demand for Lancashire\r\nproducts. The Government, it is interesting to note, have commissioned\r\ncertain firms in Alexandria \"to buy cotton extensively from small\r\nproprietors at a reasonable rate, on Government account, to be stored until\r\nthe arrival of more prosperous times.\" (Press Association Telegram, _Daily\r\nPress,_ Nov. 2, 1914).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The voluntary gifts of different parts of the Empire should\r\nnot be overlooked. Besides these other steps have been taken. The\r\nAustralian Government, for example, in order to induce farmers to extend\r\nthe area of cultivation, has guaranteed \"a fixed minimum price of 4s.\" for\r\nall wheat grown on the newly cultivated land. (Reuter's Correspondent,\r\n_Daily Press_, Oct. 27, 1914).]\r\n\r\nThe course of events has shown the temporary collapse of economic\r\nindividualism in the face of the European crisis. The economic system,\r\nwhich works during times of peace, could not meet successfully the crushing\r\neffects of a European war. It lacked not only adequate resources but the\r\nnecessary power of corporate action and co-ordination. Immediate State\r\naction seemed to be the only way to avert disaster. In a month, Britain\r\ncame nearer than ever before to being a co-operative commonwealth. It has\r\nbeen realised that industry and commerce are not primarily intended as a\r\nfield for exploitation and profit, but are essential national services in\r\nas true a sense as the army and navy. The complexity of the modern economic\r\nworld and the large individual gains which have been made in it have\r\nobscured the fact that the economic structure exists to serve the needs of\r\nthe community. It was recognised by the Government, at any rate to some\r\nextent, that the success of our armies in the field would be nullified if,\r\nin the economic sphere, the production of commodities and services were\r\nseriously diminished and if their interchange were hampered in a large\r\ndegree. People have felt that the spinner, the miner, the weaver, the\r\nmachinist, are all by following their occupations performing a valuable\r\nservice to the community. How far this attitude of mind will persist after\r\nthe war, when normal conditions in industry and commerce gradually return,\r\nremains to be seen.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. IMMEDIATE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC EFFECTS OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n1. _Foreign Trade_.--The effects of the war on industry and commerce will\r\nbe complicated and far reaching. The British and German Empires together\r\ntransact about two-fifths of the international trade of the world, the\r\nBritish Empire doing over a quarter and Germany almost exactly an eighth.\r\nBetween them they own over half the merchant shipping of the world. A war\r\nin which they are both engaged, therefore, must have serious consequences\r\nnot only to these countries themselves but to the countries with whom they\r\ncarry on business relations, and through them, in a lesser degree, to all\r\nother commercial countries. But this is not all: France has a foreign trade\r\namounting to £615,000,000 a year; Belgium's is valued at £326,000,000,\r\nRussia's at £275,000,000, and Austria-Hungary's at £256,000,000. Besides\r\na gigantic foreign trade there is a domestic trade, which is on a larger\r\nscale than the external trade of these countries. Let us consider in more\r\ndetail the case of Germany. Half her foreign trade is transacted with the\r\nnations now engaged in the great war. The trade of Britain, Russia, and\r\nFrance with the German Empire is now at a standstill, except possibly for\r\na very small amount transacted via neutral countries; her trade with\r\nAustria-Hungary must seriously decline. Moreover, her imports from neutral\r\ncountries and her exports to them have dwindled very considerably, and must\r\nremain small as long as British naval supremacy continues. More than one\r\nhalf of Germany's total imports are raw materials for manufactures, about\r\ntwo-thirds of her exports being manufactured goods. Assuming that she\r\ncontinues o conduct foreign trade through Norway and Sweden, Denmark,\r\nHolland, Switzerland, and Austria-Hungary, the volume will be small, and\r\neven if her whole trade with neutral countries could be maintained she\r\nwould still be without the trade of her enemies. For example, in 1913 this\r\ncountry sold goods to the value of £40,000,000 to Germany and purchased\r\nfrom her goods to the value of £80,000,000.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The following list indicates some of the chief articles of\r\ntrade between the two countries:\r\n\r\nGerman Imports into the United |  British Exports to Germany, 1912\r\nKingdom, 1912.                 |\r\n                               |\r\n                    £ million. |                        £ million.\r\nSugar                    6·2   |   Cottons and yarn        8·3\r\nCottons and yarn         5·9   |   Woollens and yarn       6·6\r\nIron and steel and             |   Coal, coke, etc.        4·4\r\nmanufactures             5·7   |   Herrings                2·4\r\nWoollens and yarn        2·6   |   Ironwork                2·1\r\nMachinery                2·4   |   Machinery               2·1\r\nGlass and Manufactures   1·1   |\r\n\r\nIt is not true, as Dr. R.G. Usher says, that Germany is \"literally\r\nself-sufficing\" (_Pan Germanism_, p. 65).]\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, economic activity has been developed on the assumption\r\nof continued peace. In Germany, however, though there were those who\r\nwould \"base all economic policy on an imaginary permanent peace,\"[1] the\r\nGovernment has had in view the possibility of war. \"Every conscientious\r\nGovernment,\" writes von Bülow, \"seeks to avoid [war] so long as the honour\r\nand vital interests of the nation permit of so doing. But every State\r\ndepartment should be organised as if war were going to break out tomorrow.\r\nThis applies to economic policy as well.\"[2] It is with this idea in mind\r\nthat the German Government has striven to maintain the importance of\r\nagriculture. \"Economic policy must foster peaceful development; but it must\r\nkeep in view the possibility of war, and, for this reason above all, must\r\nbe agrarian in the best sense of the word.\"[3] It is held that in the\r\nevent of war the home market in Germany would be an important factor in\r\nmaintaining intact the fabric of industry. \"The home market,\" we are told,\r\n\"is ... of very great importance. It would be called upon to replace the\r\nforeign market if in time of war our national frontiers should be wholly\r\nor partly closed. But in the home market agriculture is by far the most\r\nimportant customer of industry; only if agriculture is able to buy, if\r\nit earns enough itself to enable others to earn too, will it be able, in\r\ncritical times, to consume a part of the products which cannot be disposed\r\nof abroad. The old proverb, \"If the peasant has money then every one else\r\nhas too,\" is literally true, as soon as industry is forced, to a greater\r\nextent than is necessary in times of peace, to find its customers at\r\nhome.\"[4] \"As in time of war industry is dependent on the buying power of\r\nagriculture, the productive power of agriculture is a vital question for\r\nthe nation.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Imperial Germany_, by Prince Bernhard von Bülow, p. 221.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid._ p. 220. See also Bernhardi, _Germany and the Next\r\nWar_, pp. 157-159 and 260 _et seq._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Imperial Germany_, pp. 220-221.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: _Imperial Germany_, p. 219.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Ibid_. p. 221.]\r\n\r\nThe importance of agriculture in Germany is undoubtedly great; it may be,\r\nas Bülow says, that \"the value of its produce is equal to that of the\r\nproduce of industry, or even surpasses it.\"[1] But if the demand for it\r\nwere to shrink because the industrial population lost their work through\r\na shortage of raw materials or in any other way, agriculture would also\r\nsuffer. The population at present engaged in agriculture will in times of\r\npeace buy up to the practical limits of its purchasing power, and is hardly\r\nlikely, especially in the early stages of a war, to \"consume a part of the\r\nproducts which cannot be disposed of abroad,\" except in so far as they buy\r\nGerman goods (the production of which the declaration of the war may have\r\nseriously impeded), instead of commodities produced abroad. But it is\r\nquestionable whether they will be able to maintain their aggregate\r\npurchasing power. Prince Bülow ignores the fact that production for the\r\nhome market will be hampered by the possible non-arrival of foreign raw\r\nmaterials in war time; yet Germany imported raw cotton to the value of over\r\n£29,000,000 in 1913. Her foreign purchases of hides and skins amounted to\r\nover £22,500,000 and of wool to £10,000,000. With even a partial suspension\r\nof imports of these and similar commodities, industries dependent on\r\nforeign products must be severely hit; unemployment must increase and the\r\npurchasing power of the urban workers diminish. The agricultural community\r\nmust suffer also, and in all likelihood will not be able to take their\r\nnormal share of goods off the market. It is true, of course, that Germany\r\nbuys large quantities of food-stuffs from abroad, and that home produce\r\nwill be required to take their place; but they cannot be grown immediately;\r\nin the interval, industrial disorganisation must result, and before\r\nagriculture can begin to profit by the lack of foreign supplies the harm\r\nwill have been done. Moreover, agriculture must be impeded, as, owing to\r\nthe size of the German Empire, the transport of troops must seriously\r\ninterfere with the conveyance of goods to the larger centres of population.\r\nIt would seem, therefore, that the policy of developing German agriculture\r\nat the same time that her dependence on foreign commerce is increasing is\r\nnot an effective reply to the British Navy. The position in Germany then is\r\nthat she must for the present be satisfied with a much smaller amount of\r\nimported food-stuffs and of the raw materials of industry; and that in any\r\ncase, even if the industrial machine could be kept at work, there will be\r\npractically no outlet for goods abroad. Commercially isolated, she must,\r\ntherefore, suffer an industrial and commercial collapse. On the other hand,\r\nthe total volume of unemployment, which would have been enormous during\r\nthe first weeks of the war, has of course been considerably reduced by the\r\nwithdrawal of great masses of men to join the colours, and by the stimulus\r\nwhich the war has given to industries supplying the needs of the German\r\narmies. Then also Rotterdam, through which Germany does a great deal of\r\nits trade, remains open, whilst a fraction of her foreign trade is being\r\ncarried on through Denmark, Scandinavia, and Switzerland. Nevertheless, the\r\namount of economic distress within a very few weeks after the outbreak of\r\nwar, especially in the large towns, was considerable even on the showing of\r\nGerman newspapers.[2] The amount of distress was increased and intensified\r\nby steadily rising prices. As the rise has taken place not only in\r\ncommodities of which there is a shortage, but in others such as sugar, it\r\nmay be concluded that it is due largely to the inflation of the currency,\r\nowing to the adoption of the fatally easy expedient of issuing large masses\r\nof paper money.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_. p. 217.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Let us imagine,\" says Bernhardi, \"the endless misery which\r\na protracted stoppage or definite destruction of our oversea trade would\r\nbring upon the whole nation, and in particular on the masses of the\r\nindustrial classes who live on our export trade\" _(Germany and the Next\r\nWar,_ p. 232).\r\n\r\nAccording to _The Times_ (Sept. 18, 1914) the German nautical newspaper\r\n_Hansa_ on Sept. 12 admitted that England had captured many millions of\r\nmarks worth of German shipping, and that \"the cessation of business will\r\ncost our shipowners many millions more.\" \"It will hold up the development\r\nof our shipping trade for years.\" The _Neue Freie Presse_ of Vienna on\r\nSept. 11 admitted that the activity of the exporters in Germany had been\r\ncrippled. According to _The Times_ (Oct. 7), the German Socialist paper\r\n_Vorwaerts_, stated that \"the state of want has reached an alarming extent,\r\neven though we are now only at the beginning of the catastrophe which has\r\nbefallen the people of Europe.\" \"Masses of unemployment grow every month.\"]\r\n\r\nAustria-Hungary, which is not an advanced industrial country, will not\r\nsuffer quite so keenly, though even here the German newspapers admit that\r\ntrade has come almost to a standstill.[1] In the western theatre of war the\r\nfighting has centred largely round the Franco-Belgian Coalfield, on or near\r\nwhich stand on both sides of the frontier many industrial towns. Lille,\r\nNancy, Epinal, Belfort, Reims, Amiens, and Valenciennes on one side, and\r\nLiège and Charleroi on the other, are all of economic importance. Even\r\napart from the actual destruction due to the war which in some of these\r\ntowns has been serious, the mere presence of the contending armies will\r\nhave a more or less paralysing effect on industrial and commercial life in\r\nboth France and Belgium.[2] The position in Belgium, however, is much more\r\nserious than in France. It may best be described in the words of Professor\r\nSarolea, written after a visit of five weeks to his native country. \"Other\r\nbelligerent nations may suffer from unemployment. In Belgium alone there\r\nhas been created a whole nation of unemployed. In other countries trade\r\nand industry are dislocated. In Belgium they have come to a complete\r\nstandstill. Out of a population of eight millions, seven millions are under\r\nthe heel of the invader. Railwaymen are starving, for railways have ceased\r\nto work. Office clerks are starving, for banks and offices are closed.\r\nPublic officials are starving, for no salaries can be paid.... Journalists\r\nand printers are starving, for newspapers and books have ceased to appear.\r\nMill hands and coal miners and ironworkers are starving, for mills and\r\ncoal mines and iron works are closed.\"[3] Bad as this is, the condition of\r\naffairs is somewhat relieved so far as France and Belgium are concerned by\r\nthe fact that the seas are open to them, but even then we must add these\r\nareas to Germany and Austria-Hungary as regions where industry and trade\r\nare at the best severely hampered, regions all of which are important\r\nfactors in the markets of Europe, and whose commercial paralysis will\r\nre-echo through the whole commercial world.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"The shortage of raw materials, notably cotton, wool, jute,\r\nand petroleum, is greatly restricting production in many branches of\r\nmanufacture in Austria-Hungary. According to official estimates, the\r\nsupplies of some of the most necessary raw products are barely sufficient\r\nfor two more months. Factories are closing down, and the number of\r\nunemployed is steadily increasing\" (Reuter's telegram from Venice, Oct. 21,\r\n1914).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For example, the probable number of French factories in a\r\nposition to produce sugar in 1914-15, will be 82 or 83 as against 206\r\nduring the year 1913-14 _(Times_, Nov. 3, 1914).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Letter to the Press dated Sept. 12, 1914. Mr. J.H. Whitehouse,\r\nM.P., who visited Belgium says, \"The whole life of the nation has been\r\narrested.\"]\r\n\r\nThe most fortunately situated combatants in Europe are Russia and Great\r\nBritain. The former, covering half the area of Europe, has almost limitless\r\nresources, and is much more easily capable of being self-supporting than\r\nany of the other Great Powers engaged in the war. This country still\r\nhas the seas open to it.[1] The State subsidy to marine insurance has\r\nencouraged overseas trade, and the re-establishment of the remittance\r\nmarket has removed an obstacle to the flow of exports and imports. Still,\r\nit is true that the financial world cannot recover all at once. \"It is like\r\na man whose nervous system has been shattered by a great shock. Tonics and\r\nstimulants may save him from complete collapse, but real recovery is a\r\nmatter of months and even years.\"[2] Further, the work hitherto done and\r\nthe services performed for Germany and Austria are now no longer called\r\nfor; our allies in the west of Europe are suffering acutely from the\r\nimmediate economic effects of the war and the large destruction of capital;\r\nour neutral customers have not escaped scot-free. It would seem, therefore,\r\nthat in spite of the British command of the seas, production must\r\nnecessarily be seriously curtailed and that, therefore, the volume\r\nof unemployment must be very considerable. On the other hand, though\r\nproduction in France, Belgium and Russia may diminish in many directions,\r\nwhat goods they do produce for export will find no market in Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary and a proportion of them will find their way to this\r\ncountry. Such commodities will not only be valuable as food and raw\r\nmaterial for industry, but will set up a flow of British goods in payment\r\nfor them. Further, the production of commodities needed for the prosecution\r\nof the war, will increase the volume of employment. Goods of all kinds are\r\nrequired not only for the British armies but for the Allies generally. The\r\nmanner and extent to which these factors have influenced unemployment will\r\nbe considered presently.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: According to an Admiralty statement, corrected up to Sept. 23,\r\n1914, 12 British ships had been sunk by German cruisers, 8 had been sunk\r\nby mines, whilst a few fishing boats had been destroyed. British ships\r\ndetained and captured by Germany numbered 86, with a total tonnage of\r\n229,000. On the other hand, 387 German vessels had been detained or\r\ncaptured, the total tonnage being 1,140,000. According to _The Times_ (Oct.\r\n9, 1914), up to date 1.6 per cent of the tonnage registered in the United\r\nKingdom had been lost. The figures for Germany and Austria were 18 and 13\r\nper cent respectively. The Committee which prepared the State War Insurance\r\nScheme estimated that the loss during the first six months of the war might\r\nbe about 10 per cent of all British steamers employed in foreign trade.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Round Table_, Sept. 1914, p. 704.]\r\n\r\nNow the demand for the goods hitherto supplied by Germany to her foreign\r\ncustomers, though abated, will still continue. As we have seen, she cannot\r\nfor the present supply them. By whom will she be superseded?[1] The\r\nGovernment of this country early in the war took steps to co-operate with\r\nBritish traders in an attempt to obtain some share of this trade, and the\r\nUnited States also strove to make the fullest use of the opportunity. In\r\nthis country goods previously imported from Germany will, if still needed,\r\neither be bought from the next cheapest importer or produced at home.\r\nCommodities which we have in the past produced for German consumption are\r\nnot now required from us. If they continue to be made, it must be for other\r\ncountries. In other words, whether the volume of British foreign trade\r\nremains the same or not, a proportion of it will be diverted into new\r\nchannels during the progress of the war. In a less degree, the trade of\r\nother states will be deflected from its accustomed channels. Beyond this,\r\nspecial influences will be felt in the case of certain new countries, as\r\nfor example Canada. \"Canada's annual balance of trade is probably about\r\n£60,000,000 against her: £30,000,000 being the excess of her trade imports\r\nover her trade exports and the remaining £30,000,000 representing her\r\nannual payment on money borrowed. She has balanced her account hitherto by\r\nborrowing very large sums of money. Now she will be unable to do that any\r\nlonger. Nor will she at present, at any rate, obtain the immigrants on\r\nwhich she is counting to enable her to pay her interest. She cannot redeem\r\nthe balance due by the export of gold. The burden would be too great in any\r\ncase, and moreover she has suspended specie payments. A part of the balance\r\ndue may be covered by the higher value of her exports, such as wheat. The\r\nremainder she can only meet either by increasing her exports or by\r\nreducing her imports. The latter she has already begun to do.\"[2] This new\r\nreadjustment may be accompanied by great economic loss; in any case the\r\ndislocation will be harmful for the time, not only to the new countries,\r\nbut to the countries with whom they trade. It is clear that foreign trade\r\ngenerally will during the war gradually be readjusted to the new conditions\r\nof the times. To what extent the various streams of the world's trade will\r\nbe directed into new channels it is impossible to say; the readjustment\r\nwill be partly temporary, and partly permanent.[3] This redistribution of\r\nproduction, if it leads to production under less favourable conditions than\r\nbefore, will tend to raise prices, and thereby probably diminish the\r\npower to buy other commodities. If it leads to the substitution of a well\r\norganised and well paid industry by an industry of a less skilled kind,\r\nthere will be in effect a net lowering of wages. The widespread effects of\r\nthe war on industry and commerce must, therefore, have a profound effect on\r\nthe whole of the economic world.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Towards the end of August, the tin-plate and steel-sheet trade\r\nin this country which had suffered badly on the outbreak of war revived,\r\nand \"several mills were reopened, owing to the obtaining of orders which\r\nformerly went to Germany\" (_Board of Trade Labour Gazette_, Sept. 1914, p.\r\n330).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Round Table_, Sept. 1914, pp. 708-9.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This, of course, does not mean that Great Britain will\r\n\"capture\" German trade and increase its foreign commerce by the amount of\r\nits value.]\r\n\r\n2. _Unemployment and Short Time_.--We are now able to understand how the\r\nwar has affected the individual workman. As we have seen, the panic caused\r\nby the outbreak of war and the collapse of the remittance market meant\r\nin many industries the holding up of production and the stoppage of the\r\nworkman's wages. If it had not been possible to restart the machinery of\r\nexchange, starvation would have walked through the land, and the industries\r\ndependent on foreign raw material would have closed down altogether. As it\r\nwas, the inevitable dislocation increased the amount of unemployment.[1]\r\nWhereas the trade union percentage[2] of unemployment amongst their members\r\nwas only 2.8 at the end of July, it had reached 7.1 by the end of August.\r\nThis figure, however, is considerably below the percentage of unemployed\r\nduring many periods of trade depression; the average for the whole of 1908\r\nwas 7.8 and for 1909, 7.7, whilst during the month of March 1912 it rose to\r\n11.3 as a result of the coal strike.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Note that unemployment prior to the war was showing a tendency\r\nto increase.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It should be observed that these figures relate only to about\r\na million trade unionists, no non-unionists being included. Further, they\r\nignore short time.]\r\n\r\nThe volume of unemployment during August varied considerably from trade to\r\ntrade. In the cotton industry, which, however, appeared to be in for a bad\r\ntime anyhow, 17.7 per cent of the trade union members were returned as\r\nunemployed during August 1914, whilst in coal mining the percentage was\r\n1.3. As compared with the previous month of July, there was a general\r\ndecline in all industries except shipbuilding, which benefited by increased\r\nactivity on Government work. The contraction in the volume of employment\r\nwas specially marked in the case of tin-plate works and in the textile,\r\nfurnishing and woodworking, and pottery trades. Again, in the trades where\r\nthe Government scheme of compulsory unemployment insurance applies, the\r\nvolume of unemployment at the end of July was 3.6 per cent, but at the end\r\nof August it had reached 6.2 per cent or double the volume recorded in\r\nAugust 1913.[1] Beyond this, there was during the month of August, an\r\nenormous amount of short time; in several industries for which particulars\r\nare available, thousands of workpeople were working half-time or less.[2]\r\nThe rise which took place in the price of certain food-stuffs especially\r\nduring the first part of August intensified the evil by reducing \"real\"\r\nwages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The gradual increase during the month may be observed from the\r\nweekly returns:--Aug. 7, 4.0 per cent; Aug. 14, 5.1 per cent; Aug. 21, 5.8\r\nper cent; Aug. 28, 6.2 per cent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Board of Trade receives monthly reports from employers and\r\nothers in different industries. These returns, though they do not cover\r\nthe whole of the industries, are sufficiently reliable to indicate the\r\nwidespread character of short time. During August 1914, in slate quarries\r\nand china clay works, \"there was a good deal of short time and some\r\nunemployment in consequence of the war\"; in tin-plate and sheet-steel\r\nworks, \"short time was very general. In some cases discharges were obviated\r\nby the sharing of work at the mills remaining open. The decrease in\r\nemployment is to be attributed to the effects of the war, and in particular\r\nto the general restriction of the European market\"; some branches of the\r\nengineering trade, particularly agricultural and textile machinery, and the\r\nmotor car and cycle trades, were \"disorganised by the war; many discharges\r\ntook place and a large amount of short time was worked.\" In the\r\nmiscellaneous metal trades, except in the manufacture of articles required\r\nfor military and naval purposes, \"much short time was reported.\" In the\r\ncotton industry, \"the trade as a whole was working less than three days a\r\nweek, and large numbers of workpeople were entirely unemployed.\" In the\r\nwoollen trade, \"about 60 per cent of the workpeople covered by the returns\r\nreceived were on short time, including over 20 per cent who were working\r\nhalf-time or less.\" The returns showed a decrease of \"21.5 per cent in the\r\namount of wages paid compared with a month ago.\" In the worsted industry,\r\n\"about 65 per cent of the workpeople covered by the returns were working\r\nshort time during the month, including over 30 per cent who were working\r\nonly half time or less.\" The returns showed a decrease \"of 26.5 per cent\r\nin the amount of wages paid compared with a month ago.\" In the linen trade\r\n\"short time was reported generally.\" In the hosiery industry, \"short time\r\nwas reported by firms employing over 40 per cent of the operatives covered\r\nby the returns.\" In the silk trade \"a great deal of short time was worked\r\nin all the districts.\" In the levers and curtains branches of the lace\r\nindustry \"the majority of the operatives ... were only working half time,\r\nand large numbers were altogether unemployed.\" In the carpet trade \"short\r\ntime was general, most districts working only half the usual hours.\" In the\r\nfurnishing trades \"short time was worked in almost every district.\" \"Short\r\ntime was very generally reported\" in printing. In the glass trades \"short\r\ntime was reported in several districts.\" In the potteries \"most of the\r\nfirms\" were running short time (see the _Board of Trade Labour Gazette_,\r\nSept. 1914).]\r\n\r\nDuring the month of September, however, employment revived.[1] Besides\r\nGovernment work in shipbuilding yards, certain branches of the woollen\r\nindustry were working at full pressure on the production of blankets and\r\ncloth for uniforms; the leather and boot and shoe industries on some sides\r\nreceived an impetus from the large orders placed for army boots; hosiery\r\nand knitted goods were required in large quantities. Speaking generally,\r\nindustries whose products were required for the army and navy were strained\r\nto the extent of their resources. But each industry supplies a large\r\nvariety of goods of many different grades, and machinery and works\r\nequipment cannot always be easily converted to the production of other\r\nclasses of commodities; so that even in the woollen and boot trades, for\r\nexample, the whole industries were not uniformly busy. The many industries,\r\nhowever, to which the war brought no orders, enjoyed but a slight recovery,\r\nand in some cases none at all. As the month of September proceeded,\r\nthe newspapers triumphantly referred to the fall in the percentage of\r\nunemployment. The truth is that the decline was by no means general or\r\nuniform, but was brought about, not so much by the gradual revival of\r\nnormal activity, but by the rush of Government orders. For instance, the\r\ncotton industry remained in the trough of a deep depression, and the\r\nfurniture and piano making trades profited little. Further, no account was\r\ntaken of the prevalence of short time, though over a large field it was\r\nwidespread especially amongst women. What the real position of the labour\r\nmarket was after we had been at war two months, cannot be precisely\r\ndetermined, but it was certainly more serious than the Board of Trade\r\npercentage would seem to indicate.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The percentage of unemployment at the beginning of October in\r\nthe trades compulsorily insured against unemployment was 5.1, as compared\r\nwith 6.3 at the beginning of the previous month.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: \"Certain confidential statistical enquiries on a large scale\r\nare said to support the inference to be drawn from the figures published\r\nby the Board of Trade, that at least 10 per cent of the fifteen million\r\nwage-earners in the United Kingdom are not at work at all, whilst quite as\r\nlarge a proportion are on short time. But out of more than a million men\r\nwhose services the employers have thus temporarily dispensed with, some\r\nnine hundred thousand are being clothed, or are going to be clothed, in\r\nkhaki, and given Government pay. Thus the actual unemployment among men is,\r\nexcept in (certain) black patches, only sporadic and scarcely more than\r\nwe are accustomed to. Very different is the situation of the women\r\nwage-earners. Of these apparently half a million are now unemployed, and\r\ntwice as many are working only short time. Though the industrial situation\r\nis considerably better than would have been predicted for the end of the\r\nsecond month of a world war, it was, in fact, worse than it has been at\r\nany time during the past quarter of a century\" _(New Statesman,_ Oct. 3,\r\n1914).]\r\n\r\nThe month of October saw a further recovery and a more normal state of\r\naffairs. The percentage of unemployment in insured trades continued to\r\ndecline;[1] but whilst the number of men on the Labour Exchange registers\r\nfell (from 28,664 on October 2 to 24,690 on October 30), the number of\r\nwomen registered remained almost stationary. At the end of three months\r\nfrom the beginning of the war the condition of men's employment was about\r\nnormal; but women were suffering from excessive unemployment, whilst\r\nshort time was still common in many industries in which women are largely\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The percentages are as follows: Oct. 2, 5.11; Oct. 9, 4.80;\r\nOct. 16, 4.46; Oct. 23, 4.29; Oct. 30, 4.16.]\r\n\r\nThe large volume of unemployment, which it had been anticipated would\r\naccompany a great war, was avoided, partly because of prompt State action\r\nin maintaining the fabric of commerce and finance, and therefore the supply\r\nof raw materials, and partly because of the large demand for commodities\r\nfor the Army and Navy--a war demand vastly in excess of that in any\r\nprevious war. In other words, State intervention and the Navy have\r\nplaced Great Britain in a much superior economic position to that of her\r\nadversaries.\r\n\r\n3. _Trade Unions, Co-operative Societies and Distress_.--Before the\r\noutbreak of the war there were signs that the wave of industrial activity\r\nwhich reached a high point in 1913 was receding, and that unemployment was\r\nbeginning to increase; but the trade unions did not anticipate that the\r\nordinary ebb and flow of trade was to be disturbed by a great war. Within a\r\nvery short time after the declaration of war, the trade unions experienced\r\na heavy drain on their funds in respect of unemployment benefit. It is,\r\nof course, obvious that the accumulated funds of trade unions were never\r\nintended as a subsidy to the community during a time of war, which is what,\r\nin point of fact, they became. It is true that the unions made efforts\r\nto conserve their resources in various ways, not least by advising their\r\nyounger members without dependants to join the army; it is true also that\r\nmost of them profited under Section 106 of the National Insurance Act\r\nby the State refund of one-sixth of their payments to their unemployed\r\nmembers; but these measures--and others--were inadequate to maintain the\r\nunions in a sound financial condition, and many unions trembled on the\r\nverge of bankruptcy.[1] Such a condition of affairs was viewed with\r\napprehension not only by the trade union movement, but by the State, with\r\nthe result that at the beginning of October the Government subsidy of\r\none-sixth was under certain conditions increased.[2] But even with this\r\nassistance, many unions will undoubtedly experience considerable difficulty\r\nin avoiding financial disaster. Speaking generally, the trade union\r\nmovement as a whole will emerge from the war in straitened circumstances.\r\nSome unions may have collapsed, and amongst others the movement in\r\nfavour of amalgamation may have received an impetus owing to financial\r\nembarrassments.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Speaking generally, it cannot be said that the trade unions\r\nfaced the crisis with either wisdom or courage. Their attitude, on the\r\nwhole, was one of utter bewilderment. The lack of the power of adaptability\r\nto new circumstances, together with the fact that sufficient pressure was\r\nnot brought to bear upon the Government in the first weeks of the war,\r\naccounts for the unfortunate position in which the trade unions found\r\nthemselves.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The scheme applies only to unions suffering from abnormal\r\nunemployment. There are also conditions that they \"should not pay\r\nunemployment benefit above a maximum rate of 17s. per week, including any\r\nsum paid by way of State unemployment benefit,\" and that they \"should agree\r\nwhile in receipt of the emergency grant to impose levies over and above the\r\nordinary contributions upon those members who remain fully employed.\"\r\nThe amount of the emergency grant in addition to the refund of one-sixth\r\nalready payable will be either one-third or one-sixth of the expenditure\r\non out-of-work pay, depending on the amount of the trade union levy. Under\r\nspecial conditions the grant is to be retrospective. It is, therefore,\r\npossible for trade unions to be subsidised so far as unemployment benefit\r\nis concerned, to the extent of one-half their payments. But this scheme\r\ndoes nothing to assist trade unions (of which there are many) which get no\r\nunemployment benefit.]\r\n\r\nThe decrease in earnings accompanying short time, and their total stoppage\r\nin the case of unemployment, mean amongst the workers a restriction of\r\npurchasing power. The shrinkage in the total wages bill, especially in\r\nLancashire, must lead to a diminution in the income of small traders and\r\nthe co-operative societies. Where trade is very bad the societies will be\r\nseverely hit; smaller purchases will mean smaller profits, which, where\r\nthere is no large reserve to fall back upon, will in turn mean the\r\ndeclaration of a smaller dividend. The \"divi\" received by the workers will\r\nbe less, and the purchases which the thrifty housewife of the north usually\r\nmakes with it in the way of clothing and replacement of household articles\r\nwill be less also; where the \"divi\" has been left in the society, it will\r\nin a large number of cases be used to supplement the scanty wages earned on\r\nshort time, or to provide the necessaries of life where the breadwinner\r\nis altogether unemployed. In places where times become very bad, the\r\nco-operative societies during the war, and for some time after, will suffer\r\nbecause of the conversion of the cash orders which ordinarily go to the\r\n\"co-op\" into credit orders at the shop round the corner. On the whole,\r\nhowever, the co-operative societies will probably come better out of the\r\nwar than many classes of small shop-keepers. The small tailors, drapers,\r\nearthenware dealers, etc., and others who sell all but indispensable\r\ncommodities, will see a shrinkage in their sales, especially if prices\r\nrise. The co-operative societies will also lose in this respect, but they\r\nwill lose less on the whole, owing to the fact that a good deal of their\r\ncapital is used in the sale of food-stuffs, the consumption of which will\r\nbe restricted last. But admitting this, they cannot expect to escape\r\nunscathed, and the blow they suffer will be felt on other sides of their\r\nactivity, such as their educational work, the income for which usually\r\nfluctuates with the prosperity of the societies.\r\n\r\nThe diminution of the purchasing power of the working people because of the\r\nrestriction of the national wages bill, however, may be minimised by common\r\naction. The National Relief Fund and the Women's Employment Fund are\r\nintended really for this purpose. The establishment of women's training\r\nworkshops and of maintenance grants on condition of attendance at schools\r\nand classes are steps in the same direction. The Government has increased\r\nthe disgracefully low payments made to dependants of soldiers on active\r\nservice, and its scale of pensions for widows of soldiers and sailors and\r\nfor those totally or partially disabled in the performance of military or\r\nnaval duties. Arrangements have been made for the payment of allowances of\r\nhalf wages up to a maximum of £1 a week to dependants of sailors employed\r\non insured British merchant ships captured or detained by the enemy. More\r\nimportant from the point of view of industry as a whole are the steps which\r\nhave been taken to minimise the effects of a diminution in the volume of\r\nemployment by the development of new openings. The Government through the\r\nBoard of Trade took the lead in the attempt to secure a share of the trade\r\nhitherto done by Germany and Austria. Special efforts were made to develop\r\nthe manufacture of toys, and other industrial experiments were begun by\r\nthe Central Committee on Women's Employment. The Government appointed\r\na Chemical Products Supply Committee with a view to stimulating the\r\nproduction of dyes and drugs at home. These proposals are in the main an\r\nattempt to divert the trade of foreign countries, especially Germany, into\r\nBritish channels. The second line of action is fuller provision of home\r\nneeds which cannot be satisfied by foreign producers, but are essentially\r\ndomestic. Such needs are housing, public parks, roads, etc. Between August\r\n4 and September 21, 1914, the Local Government Board received over 600\r\napplications from local authorities for powers to borrow money amounting\r\nin all to over £2,500,000. About a fifth of this amount it was intended to\r\nexpend on housing. During this period the Board sanctioned loans amounting\r\nin the aggregate to more than £3,500,000, as compared with rather under\r\n£2,000,000 in the same period in 1913. The Road Board arranged to put in\r\nhand the construction of certain new highways arranged for before the\r\nbeginning of the war. In addition, in the first seven weeks of the war, the\r\nBoard arranged to make grants amounting to about £450,000 in aid of new\r\nroad construction and road improvements in many different parts of the\r\ncountry, which will involve a total expenditure of about a million\r\nsterling. The Development Commission began to consider schemes for the\r\nconstruction of light railways, for the improvement of the navigation of\r\nrivers, etc., in order that work of this kind should be ready to be put\r\ninto operation when the necessity arose. The Board of Agriculture has urged\r\nthat where practicable the acreage under wheat should be increased. This\r\nsuggestion is, of course, valuable, but will not greatly affect the\r\nindustrial situation. Even if the schemes sanctioned by the Local\r\nGovernment Board and those adopted by the Road Board were put into\r\noperation immediately, which is almost impossible, they would not make a\r\nvery appreciable difference to the total wages bill of the country. But\r\nperhaps it is thought by the Government that the state of employment is not\r\nsufficiently grave to warrant a greater expenditure at the present time. In\r\nspite of the insistence on forestalling destitution, there is still\r\namong local authorities much confusion of charity and relief work with\r\nanticipation of future needs calling for employment through the ordinary\r\nchannels of trade. On the whole the Government has not met the domestic\r\nproblems of the war with the unanimity and boldness which has characterised\r\nits actions in the actual prosecution of the war and in dealing with the\r\nfinancial crisis.\r\n\r\n4. _The New Spirit._--The broader social effects which showed themselves in\r\nthe early days of the war are illustrated by the remarkable growth of State\r\nSocialism. The nation became a community, united in a single purpose;\r\nbreaches which many imagined to be permanent, cleavages which were thought\r\nto be fundamental, no longer existed. None was for a party; all were for\r\nthe State. The three political parties formed a Parliamentary Recruiting\r\nCommittee, and altogether impossible teams of people appeared on public\r\nplatforms with a common aim; Mr. Ben Tillett, in words that might have\r\nfallen from the lips of a Tory ex-Cabinet minister, declared that \"every\r\nresource at our command must be utilised for the purpose of preserving our\r\ncountry and nation\"; the anti-militarist trade union movement earnestly\r\nappealed to those of its members who were ex-non-commissioned officers\r\nto re-enlist; the Queen and Miss Mary MacArthur were members of the same\r\ncommittee. This unanimity, which has pushed into the background for the\r\npresent causes of difference, has led the vast majority of people to submit\r\ncheerfully to the will of the State. The unity of to-day must necessarily\r\nmake its influence felt even when the reason of its existence has passed\r\naway. In the meantime it is assisting in the growth of a new spirit which\r\nthe war itself has fostered. The social outlook of the people and their\r\nattitude towards the larger problems of life is changing, and patriotism\r\nhas taken a deeper meaning.\r\n\r\nSo far we have devoted our attention to some of the immediate effects of\r\nthe war. But on the return of peace there will be new influences at work,\r\nthe immediate and ultimate effects of which will powerfully affect the\r\ncourse of future development. The European War will mark an era in\r\ninternational politics. It may also stand as a landmark in the history of\r\nthe social and economic life of Western Europe. It is not unlikely that in\r\nthis respect it will surpass in its importance all the wars of the past.\r\nThe reasons are to be found in the magnitude and costliness of the war, the\r\nhighly developed character and the inter-relatedness of foreign commerce,\r\nthe possibility of new industrial forces coming into play, and the\r\ninfluence of the war on the political and social ideas of the European\r\npeoples. It may be that in this country the war will let loose economic\r\nforces destined to modify industrial organisation very profoundly; and\r\nthat social forces, especially on the Continent, will be liberated to work\r\ntowards fuller political freedom. These things lie in the veiled future,\r\nand prophecy is dangerous. We may, however, turn to consider some of the\r\nprobable effects the war will leave behind it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. AFTER THE WAR\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _General Effects_.--When the war comes to an end, an immediate revival\r\nof commercial relations between the combatant States and a general revival\r\nof foreign trade cannot be reasonably expected. After the Napoleonic Wars,\r\nEnglish manufacturers, assuming the eagerness of continental peoples to buy\r\ntheir goods, were met with the obvious fact that impoverished nations are\r\nnot good customers. When peaceful relations are resumed in Europe, we shall\r\nrecognise very vividly the extent to which industry and commerce on the\r\nContinent have been closed down. Even assuming that British production\r\ncontinues, Germany, Belgium and Austria will have little to send us\r\nin exchange. The closing of the overseas markets of Germany, and the\r\nconsequent shrinkage in production, the disruption of normal industrial\r\nlife by the withdrawal of millions of men to join the colours, and the\r\nabnormal character of existing trade, due to the needs of the armies in\r\nthe field, are not conditions favourable to the easy resumption of normal\r\ncommercial relations. The dislocation of the mechanism of industry and\r\ncommerce in Europe, on a much larger scale than ever before--a mechanism\r\nwhich has with growing international relations and interdependence become\r\nmore complicated and more sensitive in recent years--cannot be immediately\r\nremedied by a stroke of the pen or the fiat of an emperor. The credit\r\nsystem upon which modern industry and commerce are built depends upon\r\nmutual confidence. This confidence will not be restored among the combatant\r\nnations immediately on the cessation of war; it will require time to grow.\r\nFurther, Europe during the war has been spending its substance and must\r\nemerge much poorer. This applies not only to combatant States, but to\r\nneutral countries, some of which have floated loans to meet the abnormal\r\nexpenditure thrown upon them by prolonged mobilisation. The capital and\r\ncredit of a large number of people will have suffered great loss or have\r\nvanished into thin air. Houses, shops, and buildings of all kinds, produce\r\nmanufactured and unmanufactured, bridges, ships, railway stations and stock\r\nof enormous value will have been destroyed. The community will have\r\nbeen impoverished, not only by the expenditure of great armies and the\r\ndestruction of wealth, but by the utilisation for immediate consumption of\r\nwealth which would have been used as new capital, and by the withdrawal of\r\nprobably close upon fifteen million men from production during the period\r\nof the war. Even if we assume that the world has lost the production of\r\nonly twelve million men[1], the loss is enormous. If each man were capable\r\nof producing, on the average, wealth to the value of £100 per year, the\r\nloss of production per year during the continuance of the war would be\r\nabout £1,200,000,000. The effect of these factors will be heightened by\r\nthe fact that the millions of men whose needs during the war have been\r\nsatisfied by their non-combatant fellow-countrymen will be thrown upon\r\ntheir own resources. And though Europe will still need to be fed and clad\r\nand housed, the effectual demand of the population for the goods and\r\nservices it needs, a demand which it is able to satisfy because of its\r\npossession of exchangeable wealth, will be smaller than before the war.\r\nThe demand will be more or less stifled until the credit system is\r\nre-established and mutual confidence restored, and until industry and\r\ncommerce have adjusted themselves to the new situation. The volume of\r\nemployment in this country during the war will have been swollen by\r\ntemporary demands for war supplies which will cease when the war ends;\r\nforeign trade will be uncertain; a larger number of soldiers will be thrown\r\non the labour market than ever before. It would seem, therefore, that in\r\nthe absence of special steps, the volume of unemployment at the close of\r\nthe war will be a good deal greater than during the progress of the war[2].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The number must be larger than this, as the mobilisation of\r\nthe armies of neutral states should be taken into account.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is thought by some that the war will be followed by a short\r\nboom, when Europe will make good the necessities of industry and\r\ncivilised life, but it is at least doubtful whether there will be a rapid\r\nreproduction of these commodities, owing to the conditions, already\r\ndescribed, which will obtain at the close of the war. In any case, however,\r\nit will be merely a flash in the pan, and there will follow the gloom of a\r\ndeep depression, unless there is clear-sighted State action.]\r\n\r\nIt is just conceivable, though one hopes not probable, that the economic\r\neffects of the war will be complicated by the imposition of war\r\nindemnities. The indemnity is really a means of obtaining booty from a\r\nvanquished State, and has been looked upon as a justifiable means of\r\nfurther humiliating an already beaten enemy. It has been pointed out[1],\r\nhowever, that the advantages derived from an indemnity are not an unmixed\r\ngain. The indemnity recoils on the heads of those who impose it. It is\r\nunnecessary here to enter into a consideration of the detailed effects\r\nof huge payments by defeated nations; though it may be remarked that the\r\nramifications of such payments are so intricate and often so incapable of\r\nmeasurement, whilst other economic influences are at work at the same\r\ntime, that it is impossible to draw an accurate conclusion as to the net\r\nadvantage or disadvantage of indemnities to the State which levies them.\r\nBut the point to be borne in mind is that the addition of a great debt to\r\nthe already large burden of an unsuccessful war reacts upon all countries\r\nwith which the defeated state enters into business relations. The losses\r\ndue to this cause will not necessarily be counterbalanced by gains from\r\nincreased trade with the country receiving the indemnity; and even if they\r\nwere, the latter trade might be of a different character. In any case,\r\ncountries not parties to the indemnity will be affected by it in some way\r\nor other; war indemnities, like wars, do not pass by neutral countries and\r\nleave them untouched.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Norman Angell, _The Great Illusion_, Part I. chap. vi.]\r\n\r\nIt is important to remember that, though modern warfare is much more costly\r\nand more exhausting than in the past, there is another side to the matter.\r\nSociety has also gained remarkably in its powers of recuperation. The\r\nblight of war is not as terrible as might be expected. The accumulated\r\nknowledge, the vastly increased productivity of industry, and the high\r\norganising ability, which have made the modern industrial and commercial\r\nworld, will not be obliterated by the war. And though there will be\r\ndifficulties in the way of their full operation when peace returns, they\r\nwill aid powerfully in shortening the period of recovery. The forces which\r\nhave transformed mediaeval into modern cities in a few short years will\r\nstill exist. Though they can hardly be expected to overcome all the many\r\nfactors likely to restrain economic activity, they may be relied on to\r\nstimulate the revival of normal economic life. Indeed, the knowledge of\r\nscience and the faculty of organisation are likely to be applied more\r\nextensively than in the past to productive processes.\r\n\r\nAfter the war, when the States of Europe begin to tread the paths of peace\r\nagain, one of the first things to be done will be to repair as far as\r\npossible the damage done by the war. Take Belgium as an extreme example;\r\nleaving aside the irreparable destruction of historic buildings and\r\npriceless treasures, there are many million pounds' worth of houses and\r\nfarm buildings, shops, warehouses, factories, public buildings, ships,\r\nrailway stations, and bridges to be replaced. This work will take\r\nprecedence over other kinds of production. Sugar, motor cars, glass, etc.,\r\nwill still be manufactured, but chiefly in order to buy the requisite raw\r\nmaterials and finished goods for the replacement of the wealth destroyed by\r\nthe ravages of the war. Speaking generally, Belgium will probably consume\r\nless food than ordinarily, wear less clothes, and consume less luxuries.\r\nSavings, which would normally have been devoted to new industrial\r\ndevelopments, will be needed to make good the losses in existing industrial\r\nestablishments. It is clear, therefore, that the economic growth of Belgium\r\nwill be retarded in a great degree.[1] The same holds good of Germany,\r\nthough probably not to the same extent unless the theatre of war is\r\nextended to cover a considerable part of the Empire. In the case of our own\r\ncountry, provided it remains free from invasion, there will not be such a\r\nlarge replacement of lost wealth and capital destroyed by the war, except\r\nin the case of shipping; but in common with other States there will be the\r\nwar to pay for, and certain obligations to meet regarding the maimed and\r\nthe relatives of the slain. Taxation will be heavy, and therefore, on this\r\nground alone the accumulation of new capital will be retarded. Industrial\r\norganisation, having been re-arranged and modified to meet the requirements\r\nof the war period, will not resume its old form without a good deal of\r\ncreaking and jolting. And even if it could, it will not be able to face\r\nthe new conditions arising out of the war at all rapidly. There is every\r\nprospect, therefore, of a time of great difficulty after the war is over,\r\nbefore the normal course of industrial and commercial activity is fully\r\nresumed. In all likelihood, we shall find that the relative importance\r\nof our various industries will have altered to some extent, and that the\r\nnature of our trade will have been modified also. Then also the relative\r\npositions of our home and foreign trade may shift; in other words, if\r\nthe war lasts sufficiently long for new industries to develop and become\r\nefficient, they may survive the competition of foreign goods after the\r\nwar; in which case, the goods which have hitherto been produced to buy the\r\nforeign goods will not now be required for foreign trade. It may be that\r\non the return of peace, some European States, in order to give their\r\nindustries an opportunity to recover from the effects of the war, will\r\ninaugurate new tariffs; there is, indeed, a strong possibility that on\r\nthese grounds, and because of the dependence of the United Kingdom on the\r\nproducts of Germany, the Tariff Reform Movement here may be electrified\r\ninto life.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: If Germany be required to compensate Belgium for the damage\r\ndone, these effects will in large part disappear; though the burden\r\nwould still remain. The difference would be that it would be more widely\r\ndistributed.]\r\n\r\n2. _Possible Industrial Developments_.--But industrial changes will not be\r\nconfined to the direction and form which economic activity will take. As\r\nhas been suggested above, there may be far-reaching changes in the methods\r\nof production. It has been said that \"there is only one way by which the\r\nwealth of the world will be quickly replaced after the war and that is\r\nby work. The country whose workers show the greatest capacity for\r\nproductiveness will be the country which will most rapidly recuperate.\"[1]\r\nThe question goes deeper than the replacement of wealth. The position after\r\nthe war will be that production will be retarded because of the diminution\r\nin the rate of accumulation of new capital since the beginning of the war;\r\nthere will be a certain amount of leeway to make up. Consequently, there\r\nwill be every incentive towards the greatest possible efficiency in\r\nproduction. It is here that the workers are likely to be affected. Has\r\nlabour reached its maximum efficiency? It has been shown by the application\r\nof what is called \"scientific management,\" that the output of labour can be\r\nincreased to a remarkable extent. For instance, instead of shovelling 16\r\ntons a day, a man can shovel 59 tons; a man loading pig-iron increased his\r\ntotal load per day from 12-1/2 to 47-1/2 tons; the day's tale of bricks\r\nlaid has been raised from 1000 to 2700. The list could be extended to cover\r\noperatives working at machines. In the endeavour to screw up industry to a\r\nmaximum of production, it is not likely that the expedients of \"scientific\r\nmanagement\" will long remain untried. Already the system is making\r\nconsiderable headway in the United States, and it is not altogether unknown\r\nin this country. It is not possible to enter into a full explanation of the\r\nmethods of \"scientific management.\" Briefly, by a process of scientific\r\nselection it puts each worker in the job for which he is best fitted, and\r\nteaches him exactly how to use the most efficient tools with which he\r\nwould be provided. The method of teaching may be illustrated from Mr. F.W.\r\nTaylor's own example: \"Schmidt started to work, and all day long and at\r\nregular intervals, was told by the man who stood over him with a watch,\r\n'Now, pick up a pig and walk. Now sit down and rest. Now walk--now rest,'\r\netc. He worked when he was told to work, and rested when he was told to\r\nrest, and at half-past five in the afternoon had his 47-1/2 tons loaded on\r\nthe car.\"[2] By elaborate experiments the exact shape and size of a shovel\r\nis determined; by long observation useless and awkward movements of a\r\nworkman are eliminated or replaced by the correct movements giving the\r\nmaximum return for the minimum of effort. In this way, and by a bonus\r\non wages, a largely increased output is obtained. It is clear that the\r\nadoption of such methods gives the \"scientific manager\" great power; it\r\nalso seems inevitable that the workman should degenerate into an automaton;\r\nit is obvious that in the hands of employers ignorant of the principles\r\nunderlying it, and seeing merely a new and highly profitable method of\r\nexploitation, it will be open to serious abuse, as experience has already\r\nshown in America.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Round Table_, Sept. 1914, p. 708.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Scientific Management_, by F.W. Taylor, p. 47.]\r\n\r\nSo far the tremendous significance of \"scientific management\" has not\r\nbeen fully recognised. Properly understood, it is the complement to the\r\nindustrial revolution, which by the more extensive use of machinery, etc.,\r\nincreased the efficiency of capital. The present movement aims at a similar\r\nincrease in the efficiency of labour as an agent of production. The new\r\nrevolution in industry has as yet merely begun, because employers, in spite\r\nof the motive of self-interest, are conservative; but it will receive an\r\nenormous impetus from the conditions arising out of the war. Like the\r\nintroduction of machinery and factory industry a century and a half ago and\r\nonward, it may be accompanied by widespread evils and cruel exploitation.\r\nIndeed, there is every likelihood that the methods will be distorted and\r\nmisused. By their careful application there is no doubt that the output of\r\nthe labourer can be increased without the expenditure of greater effort\r\nthan before, but even then there would be the tendency towards becoming\r\nde-humanised. This, however, might be overcome by shorter hours and higher\r\nwages, which would raise the standard of comfort and widen the worker's\r\ninterests. Unwisely used, \"scientific management\" will become an instrument\r\nfor shackling the worker, and increasing at a great rate the wealth of the\r\ncapitalist. It will be freely admitted that anything that will increase the\r\nproductivity of the labourer, and therefore the wealth of the community, is\r\nadvantageous, provided there is an equitable distribution of the product,\r\nand that the effects on the working members of the State are not socially\r\ninjurious. But the hidden evils that may manifest themselves are very real,\r\nand it is important that not only the workers, but the State should be\r\nprepared to save the good and prevent the evil. There will, however, be\r\nlarge numbers of employers of labour who will not avail themselves of the\r\nnew-fangled methods, and who will endeavour to increase production by the\r\nold policy of \"driving.\" And even without driving, wage-earning labour\r\nunder present conditions may be carried on under circumstances unfavourable\r\nto industrial efficiency, and for hours inimical to the welfare of the\r\ncommunity and actually injurious to industrial productivity. In the future\r\nthe State will be more closely concerned with industry and commerce than\r\nhitherto; there will probably be a more clearly defined State policy aimed\r\nat the encouragement of production. Its view will be wider than that of the\r\nindividual employer, and we may expect therefore, providing there is no\r\nserious reaction after the strain of the war, that the State will impose\r\nworking conditions which will favour maximum production in the long run. It\r\nwill be to the interest of the community to maximise the efficiency of the\r\nindustrial system; and enlightened statesmanship will overhaul our existing\r\ncode of industrial laws to achieve this object as far as possible, as well\r\nas to guard the community against the evils inherent in a misapplication of\r\nthe principles of \"scientific management.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See an article on \"Next Steps in Factory and Workshop Reform,\"\r\nby Arthur Greenwood, in the _Political Quarterly_ for September 1914.]\r\n\r\nAfter the war, unemployment is likely to increase. The work of new\r\nproduction will be put into operation only gradually; there will be every\r\ninducement to economise the use of labour as far as possible; wages during\r\nthe depression will most probably fall; there will be disaffection in the\r\nranks of the trade unionists; the possible consolidation of industries into\r\nthe hands of fewer employers will increase the strength of the masters; the\r\nfunds of the trade unions will be depleted by the heavy strain on their\r\nresources, and subject to a further drain after the war. The outlook of the\r\ntrade union movement is, therefore, far from bright. It will be generally\r\nagreed that the bankruptcy or serious impoverishment of the unions of this\r\ncountry would be nothing less than a national disaster; but unless action\r\nof some kind is taken, they will become greatly weakened and almost\r\nimpotent, and one great bulwark against unjust encroachments upon the\r\nrights of labour will be removed.\r\n\r\nIt is not improbable, however, that the community will indirectly assist\r\nthe trade unions by the steps taken to mitigate the evils which the war\r\nwill leave in its train. The army instead of being immediately disbanded\r\nmay be gradually dismissed over a period of, say, five years; the widows\r\nand dependants of soldiers and sailors, and those who have returned maimed\r\nand crippled from the war, may be adequately provided for, and, together\r\nwith children of twelve and thirteen, kept off the labour market; the\r\nlarger schemes of the Development Commission may be put into operation; the\r\nlegal minimum wage may be extended to all low-paid trades. In these and\r\nother ways the community may deal comprehensively with the problems it\r\nhas to face. The difficulties of the aftermath period will call for both\r\nclear-sighted action and public spirit; and if it is to be bridged over\r\nsuccessfully, the transition from a war to a peace footing must be gradual;\r\nthe community must continue its state of mobilisation in order to meet the\r\nenemy within the gates. Provided the united wisdom of the nation is thrown\r\ninto the task, the evil after-effects of the war may be, if not altogether\r\navoided, restricted within narrow limits. At the bottom, therefore, the\r\nfuture course of events depends upon the temper and spirit of the people at\r\nthe close of the war.\r\n\r\n3. _Social Effects and the New Outlook_.--The European conflict will\r\nprobably exercise a strong sobering influence upon the minds of the people.\r\nThe gravity of the crisis, whatever victories may crown our arms, will\r\nbe reflected in the gravity of the people. A new dignity, a greater\r\nself-respect, a deeper earnestness may arise among the mass of the people,\r\nto which the conduct of our soldiers in the field will contribute. High\r\nqualities of leadership win their admiration; but for them they claim no\r\ncredit. The army is officered for the most part by people of a higher\r\nsocial standing, whose qualities they will willingly admit; but the social\r\ngulf debars them from gaining inspiration from their achievements. In the\r\ncase of the rank and file, largely drawn from their own class, the effect\r\nis different. The Tommy is flesh of their flesh and blood of their blood.\r\nThe qualities he displays reflect credit upon his class. The working man\r\nis not unmindful of the high opinion in which the British private has been\r\nheld by a line of continental soldiers from Napoleon to Bernhardi. The\r\nexploits of his fellows in the field have given the lie to stories of\r\ndeterioration; and working people are experiencing a sense of pride in\r\ntheir class which may have no inconsiderable effect on their attitude\r\nregarding social developments in the future.\r\n\r\nAlready the national temper has not submitted without protest to the\r\ndisgraceful sweating of our troops merely because their patriotism has led\r\nthem to sacrifice their lives, which are beyond all money payment. But the\r\nfeeling in favour of the war and the spirit of trust in the Government has,\r\nup to the present, overridden serious criticism. The result has been that\r\nthe Government has often remained inactive when action was needed and has\r\nacted unwisely and ignorantly at times; for example, in the case of the\r\nLocal Government Board circular, stating that the Army Council are prepared\r\nto issue allowances through the Soldiers' and Sailors' Families Association\r\nor the Local Representation Committees. It has been said that \"the whole\r\nsystem is an outrage on democratic principles. The State sweats its\r\nservants and then compels them to take the niggardly wages it allows them\r\nfrom a charitable society[1].\" This type of action may pass muster during a\r\ntime of stress, but whether the spirit of the people will accept it after\r\nthe war is over and there are the dependants of the slain to be maintained\r\nand the permanently crippled to be provided for is a different matter. Not\r\nmerely justice, but the new pride of the people will rebel against it.\r\nThese are but phases of the larger social problem. There is the question of\r\npoverty in all its ramifications. For the moment, economic injustices and\r\nsocial evils have fallen into the back of people's minds, and the new\r\nand abnormal causes of destitution are calling forth special measures\r\nof assistance. After the war, the ever-present deep-seated poverty will\r\nreassert its presence, and in the hearts of many people the question will\r\narise as to whether the community which courageously and whole-heartedly\r\nfought the enemy without the gates will turn with equal courage and\r\ndetermination when the time comes to fight the enemy within the gates. The\r\nexperiences of the war time, the willingness to embark on great projects\r\nin face of a national crisis, will not be forgotten, but will inspire in\r\nsocial reformers the hope that the country may also face the internal\r\nnational peril in a similar spirit. The national--as opposed to the\r\nindividual--poverty which the war will cause may itself be a force making\r\nfor good. As Mr. Lloyd George well said, \"A great flood of luxury and\r\nof sloth which had submerged the land is receding and a new Britain is\r\nappearing. We can see for the first time the fundamental things that matter\r\nin life, and that have been obscured from our vision by the tropical growth\r\nof prosperity.\"[2] There seems a prospect of an era of social growth and\r\nregeneration following the war. In other European countries there may be\r\nequally important developments. It may well be that in the event of German\r\ndefeat the democratic movements of that country will gain a great impetus\r\nfrom the blow given to the Prussian hegemony. In Russia there is an\r\nexpectation of a new freedom. At the first meeting of the Duma after the\r\nopening of hostilities the Labour Party declared its opinion that \"through\r\nthe agony of the battlefield the brotherhood of the Russian people will be\r\nstrengthened and a common desire created to free the land from its terrible\r\ninternal troubles.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _The Nation,_ Sept. 19, 1914.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Speech at the Queen's Hall, London, Sept. 19, 1914.]\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted, on the other hand, that there is a possibility of a\r\nperiod of reaction and torpor after the strain of the war; the country will\r\nbe seriously impoverished, and there will be a heavy burden of taxation in\r\nspite of some probable relief from the burden of armaments. Still, social\r\nevils and injustices will be more obvious than ever. There will be many new\r\nnational and imperial problems clamouring to be faced. The intellectual\r\nferment which has had its source in the war will remain at work to widen\r\nthe mental outlook and deepen the social consciousness. On the whole, it\r\nwill probably be true to say that, though circumstances may postpone it,\r\nthere will sooner or later arise a great movement pledged to cleanse our\r\nnational life of those features which bar the way to human freedom and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nIt also seems undeniable that the deep interest taken by large numbers of\r\npeople in the war will rouse them to a sense of the importance of problems\r\nof government and of foreign policy. The working men's committees on\r\nforeign affairs of half a century ago, which have left no trace behind\r\nthem, may be revived in a new form, and the differentiation of economic and\r\nsocial questions from political and foreign problems may be obliterated.\r\nThe importance of the gradually widening area of vision among the more\r\nthoughtful section of the people can hardly be exaggerated. In no respect\r\nis the broadening of outlook more discernible than in the sphere of\r\nimperial affairs. Hitherto the Empire to the working man has been regarded\r\nas almost mythical. In so far as it did exist, it was conceived as a happy\r\nhunting ground for the capitalist exploiter. The spontaneous assistance\r\ngiven to the mother country by the colonies and dependencies has convinced\r\nhim of the reality of the Empire, and vaguely inspired him with a vision of\r\nits possibilities as a federation of free commonwealths. In other words,\r\nthe British Empire, contrasted with that of Germany, is gradually being\r\nrecognised as standing for Democracy, however imperfect its achievements\r\nmay be up to the present. Consequently, the return of peace will see a\r\ndeeper interest in imperial questions; indeed, it is not too much to say\r\nthat there will be an imperial renaissance, born of a new patriotism, \"clad\r\nin glittering white.\" The change of heart which is taking place in the\r\npeople of this country, through the opening of the flood-gates of feeling\r\nand thought by the unsuspecting warrior in shining armour, may bring a new\r\nage comparable in its influence on civilisation with the great epochs of\r\nthe past. To-day is seed-time. But the harvest will not be gathered without\r\nsweat and toil. The times are pregnant with great possibilities, but their\r\nrealisation depends upon the united wisdom of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the machinery of international trade, reference\r\nshould be made to Hartiey Withers' _Money Changing_ (5s.), or Clare's\r\n_A.B.C. of the Foreign Exchanges_ (3s.); an outline of the subject will\r\nbe found in any good general text-book on Economics.

An attempt\r\nwill be made in this chapter to make clear what these conceptions are, and\r\nto discuss the issue between them as impartially as possible, from the\r\npoint of view, not of either of the combatant Powers, but of human\r\ncivilisation as a whole.\r\n\r\nThere are really two great controversies being fought out between Great\r\nBritain and Germany: one about the ends of national policy, and another\r\nabout the means to be adopted towards those or any other ends. The latter\r\nis the issue raised by the German Chancellor's plea--not so unfamiliar\r\non the lips of our own countrymen as we are now tempted to believe--that\r\n\"Necessity knows no law.\" It is the issue of Law and \"scraps of paper\"\r\nagainst Force, against what some apologists have called \"the Philosophy of\r\nViolence,\" but which, in its latest form, the French Ambassador has more\r\naptly christened \"the Pedantry of Barbarism.\" That issue has lately been\r\nbrought home, in its full reality, to the British public from the course of\r\nevents in Belgium and elsewhere, and need not here be elaborated. Further\r\nwords would be wasted. A Power which recognises no obligation but force,\r\nand no law but the sword, which marks the path of its advance by organised\r\nterrorism and devastation, is the public enemy of the civilised world.\r\n\r\nBut it is a remarkable and significant fact that the policy in which this\r\nruthless theory is embodied commands the enthusiastic and united support of\r\nthe German nation. How can this be explained?\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered in the first place that the German public does\r\nnot see the facts of the situation as we do. On the question of Belgian\r\nneutrality and the events which precipitated the British ultimatum, what\r\nwe know to be a false version of the facts is current in Germany, as is\r\nevident from the published statements of the leaders of German thought and\r\nopinion, and it may be many years before its currency is displaced.\r\n\r\nThis difficulty should serve to remind us how defective the machinery of\r\ncivilisation still is. One of the chief functions of law is, not merely to\r\nsettle disputes and to enforce its decisions, but to ascertain the true\r\nfacts on which alone a settlement can be based. The fact that no tribunal\r\nexists for ascertaining the true facts in disputes between sovereign\r\ngovernments shows how far mankind still is from an established \"rule of\r\nlaw\" in international affairs. Not only is the Hague powerless to give and,\r\nstill more, to enforce its decision on the questions at issue between the\r\nEuropean Powers. It has not even the machinery for ascertaining the facts\r\nof the case and bringing them to the notice of neutral governments and\r\npeoples in the name of civilisation as a whole.\r\n\r\nBut apart from divergent beliefs as to the facts, it is remarkable that\r\nthinking Germany should be in sympathy with the spirit and tone of German\r\npolicy, which led, as it appears to us, by an inexorable logic to the\r\nviolation of Belgian neutrality and the collision with Great Britain.\r\n\r\nBut the fact, we are told, admits of easy explanation. Thinking Germany has\r\nfallen a victim to the teachings of Treitschke and Nietzsche--Treitschke\r\nwith his Macchiavellian doctrine that \"Power is the end-all and be-all of a\r\nState,\" Nietzsche with his contempt for pity and the gentler virtues, his\r\nadmiration for \"valour,\" and his disdain for Christianity.\r\n\r\nThis explanation is too simple to fit the facts. It may satisfy those who\r\nknow no more of Treitschke's brilliant and careful work than the extracts\r\nculled from his occasional writings by General von Bernhardi and the late\r\nProfessor Cramb. It may gratify those who, with so many young German\r\nstudents, forget that Nietzsche, like many other prophets, wrote in\r\nallegory, and that when he spoke of valour he was thinking, not of \"shining\r\narmour,\" but of spiritual conflicts. But careful enquirers, who would\r\ndisdain to condemn Macaulay on passages selected by undiscriminating\r\nadmirers from his _Essays_, or Carlyle for his frank admiration of Thor\r\nand Odin and the virtues of Valhalla, will ask for a more satisfying\r\nexplanation. Even if all that were said about Treitschke and Nietzsche were\r\ntrue, it would still remain an unsolved question why they and their ideas\r\nshould have taken intellectual Germany by storm. But it is not true. What\r\nis true, and what is far more serious, both for Great Britain and for\r\nEurope, is that men like Harnack, Eucken, and Wilamowitz, who would\r\nrepudiate all intellectual kinship with Macchiavelli and Nietzsche--men who\r\nare leaders of European thought, and with whom and whose ideas we shall\r\nhave to go on living in Europe--publicly support and encourage the policy\r\nand standpoint of a Government which, according to British ideas, has\r\nacted with criminal wickedness and folly, and so totally misunderstood\r\nthe conduct and attitude of Great Britain as honestly to regard us as\r\nhypocritically treacherous to the highest interests of civilisation.\r\n\r\nThat is the real problem; and it is a far more complex and difficult one\r\nthan if we had to do with a people which had consciously abandoned the\r\nChristian virtues or consciously embarked on a conspiracy against Belgium\r\nor Great Britain. The utter failure of even the most eminent Germans to\r\ngrasp British politics, British institutions, and the British point of\r\nview points to a fundamental misunderstanding, a fundamental divergence\r\nof outlook, between the political ideals of the two countries. It is the\r\nconflict between these ideals which forms the second great issue between\r\nGermany and Great Britain; and on its outcome depends the future of human\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\n\r\n§2. _Culture_.--What is the German ideal? What do German thinkers regard\r\nas Germany's contribution to human progress? The answer comes back with a\r\nmonotonous reiteration which has already sickened us of the word. It is\r\n_Kultur_, or, as we translate it, culture. Germany's contribution to\r\nprogress consists in the spread of her culture.\r\n\r\n_Kultur_ is a difficult word to interpret. It means \"culture\" and a\r\ngreat deal more besides. Its primary meaning, like that of \"culture,\" is\r\nintellectual and aesthetic: when a German speaks of \"Kultur\" he is thinking\r\nof such things as language, literature, philosophy, education, art,\r\nscience, and the like. Children in German schools are taught a subject\r\ncalled _Kulturgeschichte_ (culture-history), and under that heading they\r\nare told about German literature, German philosophy and religion, German\r\npainting, German music and so on.\r\n\r\nSo far, the English and the German uses of the word roughly correspond. We\r\nshould probably be surprised if we heard it said that Shakespeare had made\r\na contribution to English \"culture\": but, on consideration, we should admit\r\nthat he had, though we should not have chosen that way of speaking about\r\nhim. But there is a further meaning in the word _Kultur_, which explains\r\nwhy it is so often on German lips. It means, not only the product of the\r\nintellect or imagination, but the product of the disciplined intellect and\r\nthe disciplined imagination. _Kultur_ has in it an element of order, of\r\norganisation, of civilisation. That is why the Germans regard the study of\r\nthe \"culture\" of a country as part of the study of its history. English\r\nschool children are beginning to be taught social and industrial history in\r\naddition to the kings and queens and battles and constitutions which used\r\nto form the staple of history lessons. They are being taught, that is, to\r\nsee the history of their country, and of its civilisation, in the light\r\nof the life and livelihood of its common people. The German outlook is\r\ndifferent. They look at their history in the light of the achievements of\r\nits great minds, which are regarded as being at once the proof and the\r\njustification of its civilisation. To the question, \"What right have you to\r\ncall yourselves a civilised country?\" an Englishman would reply, \"Look at\r\nthe sort of people we are, and at the things we have done,\" and would point\r\nperhaps to the extracts from the letters of private soldiers printed in the\r\nnewspapers, or to the story of the growth of the British Empire; a German\r\nwould reply (as Germans are indeed replying now), \"Look at our achievements\r\nin scholarship and science, at our universities, at our systems of\r\neducation, at our literature, our music, and our painting; at our great men\r\nof thought and imagination: at Luther, Dürer, Goethe, Beethoven, Kant.\"\r\n\r\n_Kultur_ then means more than \"culture\": it means _culture considered as\r\nthe most important element in civilisation._ It implies the disciplined\r\neducation which alone, in the German view, makes the difference between\r\nthe savage and the civilised man. It implies the heritage of intellectual\r\npossessions which, thanks to ordered institutions, a nation is able to hand\r\ndown from generation to generation.\r\n\r\nWe are now beginning to see where the British and German attitudes towards\r\nsociety and civilisation diverge. Broadly, we may say that the first\r\ndifference is that Germany thinks of civilisation in terms of intellect\r\nwhile we think of it in terms of character. Germany asks, \"What do you\r\nknow?\" \"What have you learnt?\" and regards our prisoners as uncivilised\r\nbecause they cannot speak German, and Great Britain as a traitor to\r\ncivilisation because she is allied with Russia, a people of ignorant\r\npeasants. We ask, \"What have you done?\" \"What can you do?\" and tend\r\nto undervalue the importance of systematic knowledge and intellectual\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nBut we have found no reason as yet for a conflict of ideals. Many English\r\nwriters, such as Matthew Arnold, have emphasised the importance of culture\r\nas against character; yet Matthew Arnold's views were widely different from\r\nthose of the German professors of to-day. If their sense of the importance\r\nof culture stopped short at this point, we should have much to learn from\r\nGermany, as indeed we have, and no reason to oppose her. What is there then\r\nin the German admiration for culture which involves her in a conflict with\r\nBritish ideals?\r\n\r\n\r\n§3. _Culture as a State Product._--The conflict arises out of the alliance\r\nbetween German culture and the German Government. What British public\r\nopinion resents, in the German attitude, is not culture in itself, about\r\nwhich it is little concerned, but what we feel to be its unnatural\r\nalliance with military power. It seems to us wicked and hypocritical for a\r\ngovernment which proclaims the doctrine of the \"mailed fist\" and, like the\r\nancient Spartans, glories in the perfecting of the machinery of war, to be\r\nat the same time protesting its devotion to culture, and posing as a patron\r\nof the peaceful arts. It is the Kaiser's speeches and the behaviour of the\r\nGerman Government which have put all of us out of heart with German talk\r\nabout culture.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to a fundamental point of difference between the two\r\npeoples. The close association between culture and militarism, between the\r\nbest minds of the nation and the mind of the Government, does not seem\r\nunnatural to a modern German at all. On the contrary, it seems the most\r\nnatural thing in the world. It is the bedrock of the German system of\r\nnational education. Culture to a German is not only a national possession;\r\nit is also, to a degree difficult for us to appreciate, a State product.\r\nIt is a national possession deliberately handed on by the State from\r\ngeneration to generation, hall-marked and guaranteed, as it were, for the\r\nuse of its citizens. When we use the word \"culture\" we speak of it as an\r\nattribute of individual men and women. Germans, on the other hand, think\r\nof it as belonging to nations as a whole, in virtue of their system of\r\nnational education. That is why they are so sure that all Germans possess\r\nculture. They have all had it at school. And it is all the same brand of\r\nculture, because no other is taught. It is the culture with which the\r\nGovernment wishes its citizens to be equipped. That is why all Germans\r\ntend, not only to know the same facts (and a great many facts too), but\r\nto have a similar outlook on life and similar opinions about Goethe,\r\nShakespeare and the German Navy. Culture, like military service, is a part\r\nof the State machinery.\r\n\r\nHere we come upon the connecting link between culture and militarism. Both\r\nare parts of the great German system of State education. \"Side by side with\r\nthe influences of German education,\" wrote Dr. Sadler in 1901,[1] \"are\r\nto be traced the influences of German military service. The two sets\r\nof influence interact on one another and intermingle. German education\r\nimpregnates the German army with science. The German army predisposes\r\nGerman education to ideas of organisation and discipline. Military and\r\neducational discipline go hand in hand.... Both are preserved and fortified\r\nby law and custom, and by administrative arrangements skilfully devised\r\nto attain that end. But behind all the forms of organisation (which would\r\nquickly crumble away unless upheld by and expressing some spiritual force),\r\nbehind both military and educational discipline, lies the fundamental\r\nprinciple adopted by Scharnhorst's Committee on Military organisation in\r\nPrussia in 1807: 'All the inhabitants of the State are its defenders by\r\nbirth.'\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Board of Education Special Reports,_ vol. ix. p. 43.]\r\n\r\nAt last we have reached the root of the matter. It is not German culture\r\nwhich is the source and centre of the ideas to which Great Britain is\r\nopposed: nor yet is it German militarism. Our real opponent is the system\r\nof training and education, out of which both German culture and German\r\nmilitarism spring. It is the organisation of German public life, and the\r\n\"spiritual force\" of which that organisation is the outward and visible\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\r\n§4. _German and British Ideals of Education._--Let us look at the German\r\nideal more closely, for it is worthy of careful study. It is perhaps best\r\nexpressed in words written in 1830 by Coleridge, who, like other well-known\r\nEnglishmen of his day (and our own) was much under the influence of German\r\nideas. Coleridge, in words quoted by Dr. Sadler, defines the purpose of\r\nnational education as \"to form and train up the people of the country to\r\nobedient, free, useful, and organisable subjects, citizens and patriots,\r\nliving to the benefit of the State and prepared to die in its defence.\" In\r\naccordance with this conception Prussia was the first of the larger States\r\nin Europe to adopt a universal compulsory system of State education, and\r\nthe first also to establish a universal system of military service for its\r\nyoung men. The rest of Europe perforce followed suit. Nearly every State in\r\nEurope has or professes to have a universal system of education, and every\r\nState except England has a system of universal military service. The Europe\r\nof schools and camps which we have known during the last half century is\r\nthe most striking of all the victories of German \"culture.\"\r\n\r\nDiscipline, efficiency, duty, obedience, public service; these are\r\nqualities that excite admiration everywhere--in the classroom, in the camp,\r\nand in the wider field of life. There is something almost monumentally\r\nimpressive to the outsider in the German alliance of School and Army in the\r\nservice of the State. Since the days of Sparta and Rome, there has been no\r\nsuch wonderful governmental disciplinary machine. It is not surprising that\r\n\"German organisation\" and \"German methods\" should have stimulated interest\r\nand emulation throughout the civilised world. Discipline seems to many to\r\nbe just the one quality of which our drifting world is in need. \"If this\r\nwar had been postponed a hundred or even fifty years,\" writes a philosophic\r\nEnglish observer in a private letter, \"Prussia would have become our Rome,\r\nworshipping Shakespeare and Byron as Pompey or Tiberius worshipped Greek\r\nliterature, and disciplining us. Hasn't it ever struck you what a close\r\nparallel there is between Germany and Rome?\" (Here follows a list of\r\nbad qualities which is better omitted.) ... \"The good side of it is the\r\ndiscipline; and the modern world, not having any power external to itself\r\nwhich it acknowledges, and no men (in masses) having yet succeeded in being\r\na law to themselves, needs discipline above everything. I don't see where\r\nyou will get it under these conditions unless you find some one with an\r\nabstract love of discipline for itself. And where will you find him except\r\nin Prussia? After all, it is a testimony to her that, unlovely as she is,\r\nshe gives the law to Germany, and that the South German, though he dislikes\r\nher, accepts the law as good for him.\" And to show that he appreciates the\r\nfull consequences of his words he adds: \"If I had to live under Ramsay\r\nMacDonald (provided that he acted as he talks), or under Lieutenant von\r\nFörstner\" (the hero of Zabern), \"odious as the latter is, for my soul's\r\ngood I would choose him: for I think that in the end, I should be less\r\nlikely to be irretrievably ruined.\"\r\n\r\nHere is the Prussian point of view, expressed by a thoughtful Englishman\r\nwith a wide experience of education, and a deep concern for the moral\r\nwelfare of the nation. What have we, on the British side, to set up against\r\nhis arguments?\r\n\r\nIn the first place we must draw attention to the writer's candour in\r\nadmitting that a nation cannot adopt Prussianism piecemeal. It must take\r\nit as a whole, its lieutenants included, or not at all. Lieutenant von\r\nFörstner is as typical a product of the Prussian system as the London\r\npoliceman is of our own; and if we adopt Prussian or Spartan methods,\r\nwe must run the risk of being ruled by him. \"No other nation,\" says Dr.\r\nSadler, \"by imitating a little bit of German organisation can hope thus\r\nto achieve a true reproduction of the spirit of German institutions. The\r\nfabric of its organisation practically forms one whole. That is its merit\r\nand its danger. It must be taken all in all or else left unimitated. And\r\nit is not a mere matter of external organisation.... National institutions\r\nmust grow out of the needs and character (and not least out of the\r\nweakness) of the nation which possesses them.\"\r\n\r\nBut, taking the system as a whole, there are, it seems to me, three great\r\nflaws in it--flaws so serious and vital as to make the word \"education\" as\r\napplied to it almost a misnomer. The Prussian system is unsatisfactory,\r\nfirstly, because it confuses external discipline with self-control;\r\nsecondly, because it confuses regimentation with corporate spirit; thirdly,\r\nbecause it conceives the nation's duty in terms of \"culture\" rather than of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nLet us take these three points in detail.\r\n\r\nThe first object of national education is--not anything national at all,\r\nbut simply education. It is the training of individual young people. It is\r\nthe gradual leading-out (e-ducation), unfolding, expanding, of their\r\nmental and bodily powers, the helping of them to become, not soldiers, or\r\nmissionaries of culture, or pioneers of Empire, or even British citizens,\r\nbut simply human personalities. \"The purpose of the Public Elementary\r\nSchool,\" say the opening words of our English code, \"is to form and\r\nstrengthen the character and to develop the intelligence of the children\r\nentrusted to it.\" In the performance of this task external discipline is no\r\ndoubt necessary. Obedience and consideration for others are not learnt in\r\na day. But the object of external discipline is to form habits of\r\nself-control which will enable their possessor to become an independent and\r\nself-respecting human being--and incidentally, a good citizen. \"If I had\r\nto _live under_ Ramsay MacDonald, or the Prussian Lieutenant,\" says our\r\nwriter, \"I would choose the latter, for my soul's good.\" But our British\r\nsystem of education does not proceed on the assumption that its pupils\r\nare destined to \"live under\" any one. Our ideal is that of the free man,\r\ntrained in the exercise of his powers and in the command and control of his\r\nfaculties, who, like Wordsworth's \"Happy Warrior\" (a poem which embodies\r\nthe best British educational tradition):\r\n\r\n         ... Through the heat of conflict, keeps the law\r\n         In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw.\r\n\r\nNeglect for the claims of human personality both amongst pupils and\r\nteachers is the chief danger of a State system of education. The State\r\nis always tempted to put its own claims first and those of its citizens\r\nsecond--to regard the citizen as existing for the State, instead of the\r\nState for its citizens. It is one of the ironies of history that no man was\r\nmore alive to this danger than Wilhelm von Humboldt, the gifted creator of\r\nthe Prussian system of education. As the motto of one of his writings he\r\nadopted the words, \"_Against the governmental mania, the most fatal disease\r\nof modern governments_,\" and when, contrary to his own early principles,\r\nhe undertook the organisation of Prussian education he insisted that\r\n\"headmasters should be left as free a hand as possible in all matters of\r\nteaching and organisation.\" But the Prussian system was too strong for him\r\nand his successors, and his excellent principles now survive as no more\r\nthan pious opinions. The fact is that in an undemocratic and feudal State\r\nsuch as Germany then was, and still largely is, respect for the personality\r\nof the individual is confined to the upper ranks of society.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know how it is in foreign countries,\" says one of Goethe's\r\nheroes,[1] \"but in Germany it is only the nobleman who can secure a certain\r\namount of universal or, if I may say so, _personal_ education. An ordinary\r\ncitizen can learn to earn his living and, at the most, train his intellect;\r\nbut, do what he will, he loses his personality.... He is not asked, 'What\r\nare you?' but only, 'What have you? what attainments, what knowledge, what\r\ncapacities, what fortune?' ... The nobleman is to act and to achieve.\r\nThe common citizen is to carry out orders. He is to develop individual\r\nfaculties, in order to become useful, and it is a fundamental assumption\r\nthat there is no harmony in his being, nor indeed is any permissible,\r\nbecause, in order to make himself serviceable in one way, he is forced\r\nto neglect everything else. The blame for this distinction is not to be\r\nattributed to the adaptability of the nobleman or the weakness of the\r\ncommon citizen. It is due to the constitution of society itself.\" Much has\r\nchanged in Germany since Goethe wrote these words, but they still ring\r\ntrue. And they have not been entirely without their echo in Great Britain\r\nitself.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Wilhelm Meister's _Lehrjahre_, Book v. chapter iii.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The contrast which has been drawn in the preceding pages, as\r\nworking-class readers in particular will understand, is between the _aims_,\r\nnot the achievements, of German and British education. The German aims are\r\nfar more perfectly achieved in practice than the British. Neither the law\r\nnor the administration of British education can be acquitted of \"neglect\r\nfor the claims of human personality.\" The opening words of the English\r\ncode, quoted on p. 359 above, are, alas! not a statement of fact but\r\nan aspiration. We have hardly yet begun in England to realise the\r\npossibilities of educational development along the lines of the British\r\nideal, both as regards young people and adults. If we learn the lesson\r\nof the present crisis aright, the war, so far from being a set-back\r\nto educational progress, should provide a new stimulus for effort and\r\ndevelopment.]\r\n\r\nBut man cannot live for himself alone. He is a corporate being; and,\r\npersonality or no personality, he has to fit into a world of fellow-men\r\nwith similar human claims. The second charge against the German system is\r\nthat it ignores the value of human fellowship. It regards the citizens of a\r\ncountry as \"useful and organisable subjects\" rather than as fellow-members\r\nof a democracy, bound together by all the various social ties of\r\ncomradeship and intercourse.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian system, with its elaborate control and direction from above,\r\ndislikes the free play of human groupings, and discourages all spontaneous\r\nor unauthorised associations. Schoolboy \"societies,\" for instance, are in\r\nGermany an evil to be deplored and extirpated, not, as with us, a symptom\r\nof health and vigour, to be sympathetically watched and encouraged.\r\nInstead, there is a direct inculcation of patriotism, a strenuous and\r\nmethodical training of each unit for his place in the great State machine.\r\nWe do not so read human nature. Our British tendency is to develop habits\r\nof service and responsibility through a devotion to smaller and more\r\nintimate associations, to build on a foundation of lesser loyalties and\r\nduties. We do not conceive it to be the function of the school to _teach_\r\npatriotism or to _teach_ fellowship. Rather we hold that good education\r\n_is_ fellowship, _is_ citizenship, in the deepest meaning of those words;\r\nthat to discover and to exercise the responsibilities of membership in a\r\nsmaller body is the best training for a larger citizenship. A school, a\r\nship, a club, a Trade Union, any free association of Englishmen, is all\r\nEngland in miniature. \"To be attached to the subdivision, to love the\r\nlittle platoon we belong to in society,\" said Burke long ago, \"is the first\r\nprinciple, the germ, as it were, of public affections. It is the first\r\nlink in the series by which we proceed towards a love to our country\r\nand mankind.... We begin our public affections in our families. No cold\r\nrelation is a zealous citizen. We pass on to our neighbourhoods, to our\r\nhabitual provincial connections. These are inns and resting-places... so\r\nmany images of the great country, in which the heart found something which\r\nit could fill.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Reflections on the French Revolution_, pp. 292, 494 (of vol.\r\niii. of _Collected Works_, ed. 1899).]\r\n\r\nThere is one fairly safe test for a system of education: What do its\r\nvictims think of it? \"In Prussia,\" says Dr. Sadler, \"a schoolboy seems to\r\nregard his school as he might regard a railway station--a convenient and\r\nnecessary establishment, generally ugly to look at, but also, for its\r\npurpose efficient.\" The illustration is an apt one: for a Prussian school\r\nis too often, like a railway station, simply a point of departure,\r\nsomething to be got away from as soon as possible. \"In England a boy who\r\nis at a good secondary school cares for it as an officer cares for his\r\nregiment or as a sailor cares for his ship,\" or, we may add, as a Boy Scout\r\ncares for his Troop.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Special Reports_, ix. p. 113. Dr. Sadler's article deals with\r\nsecondary schools only. Unfortunately, no one can claim that the idea of\r\nfellowship is as prominent in English elementary schools, or even in all\r\nsecondary schools, as the quotation might suggest.]\r\n\r\nDemocracy and discipline, fellowship and freedom, are in fact not\r\nincompatible at all. They are complementary: and each can only be at\r\nits best when it is sustained by the other. Only a disciplined and\r\nself-controlled people can be free to rule itself, and only a free people\r\ncan know the full meaning and happiness of fellowship.\r\n\r\n\r\n§5. _German and British Ideals of Civilisation._--Lastly, the German system\r\nregards national \"culture\" rather than national character as the chief\r\nelement in civilisation and the justification of its claim to a dominant\r\nplace in the world. This view is so strange to those who are used to\r\npresent-day British institutions that it is hard to make clear what it\r\nmeans. Civilisation is a word which, with us, is often misused and often\r\nmisunderstood. Sometimes we lightly identify it with motor cars and\r\ngramophones and other Western contrivances with which individual traders\r\nand travellers dazzle and bewilder the untutored savage. Yet we are seldom\r\ntempted to identify it, like the Germans, with anything narrowly national;\r\nand in our serious moments we recognise that it is too universal a force to\r\nbe the appanage of either nations or individuals. For to us, when we ask\r\nourselves its real meaning, civilisation stands for neither language nor\r\nculture nor anything intellectual at all. It stands for something moral and\r\nsocial and political. It means, in the first place, the establishment and\r\nenforcement of the Rule of Law, as against anarchy on the one hand and\r\ntyranny on the other; and, secondly, on the basis of order and justice,\r\nthe task of making men fit for free institutions, the work of guiding and\r\ntraining them to recognise the obligations of citizenship, to subordinate\r\ntheir own personal interests or inclinations to the common welfare, the\r\n\"commonwealth.\" That is what is meant when it is claimed that Great Britain\r\nhas done a \"civilising\" work both in India and in backward Africa. The\r\nGermans reproach and despise us, we are told,[1] for our failure to spread\r\n\"English culture\" in India. That has not been the purpose of British rule,\r\nand Englishmen have been foolish in so far as they have presumed to attempt\r\nit: England has to learn from Indian culture as India from ours. But to\r\nhave laid for India the foundations on which alone a stable society could\r\nrest, to have given her peace from foes without and security within, to\r\nhave taught her, by example, the kinship of Power and Responsibility, to\r\nhave awakened the social conscience and claimed the public services of\r\nIndians in the village, the district, the province, the nation, towards the\r\ncommunity of which they feel themselves to be members, to have found India\r\na continent, a chaos of tribes and castes, and to have helped her to\r\nbecome a nation--that is not a task of English culture: it is a task of\r\ncivilisation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For evidence of this see Cramb's _Germany and England_, p.\r\n25.]\r\n\r\nLaw, Justice, Responsibility, Liberty, Citizenship--the words are\r\nabstractions, philosophers' phrases, destitute, it might seem, of living\r\nmeaning and reality. There is no such thing as English Justice, English\r\nLiberty, English Responsibility. The qualities that go to the making of\r\nfree and ordered institutions are not national but universal. They are no\r\nmonopoly of Great Britain. They are free to be the attributes of any race\r\nor any nation. They belong to civilised humanity as a whole. They are part\r\nof the higher life of the human race.\r\n\r\nAs such the Germans, if they recognised them at all, probably regarded\r\nthem. They could not see in them the binding power to keep a great\r\ncommunity of nations together. They could not realise that Justice and\r\nResponsibility, if they rightly typify the character of British rule,\r\nmust also typify the character of British rulers; and that community of\r\ncharacter expressed in their institutions and worked into the fibre\r\nof their life may be a stronger bond between nations than any mere\r\nconsiderations of interest. Educated Indians would find it hard to explain\r\nexactly why, on the outbreak of the war, they found themselves eager to\r\nhelp to defend British rule. But it seems clear that what stirred them most\r\nwas not any consideration of English as against German culture, or any\r\nmerely material calculations, but a sudden realisation of the character of\r\nthat new India which the union between Great Britain and India, between\r\nWestern civilisation and Eastern culture, is bringing into being, and a\r\nsense of the indispensable need for the continuance of that partnership.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The reader will again understand that it is British aims\r\nrather than British achievements which are spoken of. That British rule\r\nis indispensable to Indian civilisation is indeed a literal fact to which\r\nIndian opinion bears testimony; and it is the conduct and character of\r\ngenerations of British administrators which have helped to bring this sense\r\nof partnership about. But individual Englishmen in India are often far\r\nfrom understanding, or realising in practice, the purpose of British rule.\r\nSimilarly, the growth of a sense of Indian nationality, particularly in the\r\nlast few years, is a striking and important fact. But it would be unwise to\r\nunderestimate the gigantic difficulties with which this growing national\r\nconsciousness has to contend. The greatest of these is the prevalence\r\nof caste-divisions, rendering impossible the free fellowship and social\r\nintercourse which alone can be the foundation of a sense of common\r\ncitizenship. Apart from this there are, according to the census,\r\nforty-three races in India, and twenty-three languages in ordinary use.]\r\n\r\nIt is just this intimate union between different nations for the\r\nfurtherance of the tasks of civilisation which it seems so difficult\r\nfor the German mind to understand. \"Culture,\" with all its intimate\r\nassociations, its appeal to language, to national history and traditions,\r\nand to instinctive patriotism, is so much simpler and warmer a conception:\r\nit seems so much easier to fight for Germany than to fight for Justice in\r\nthe abstract, or for Justice embodied in the British Commonwealth. That is\r\nwhy even serious German thinkers, blinded by the idea of culture, expected\r\nthe break-up of the British Empire. They could imagine Indians giving their\r\nlives for India, Boers for a Dutch South Africa, Irishmen for Ireland\r\nor Ulstermen for Ulster; but the deeper moral appeal which has thrilled\r\nthrough the whole Empire, down to its remotest island dependency, lay\r\nbeyond their ken.\r\n\r\nLet us look a little more closely at the German idea of national culture\r\nrather than national character as the chief element in civilisation. We\r\nshall see that it is directly contrary to the ideals which inspire\r\nand sustain the British Commonwealth, and practically prohibits that\r\nassociation of races and peoples at varying levels of social progress which\r\nis its peculiar task.\r\n\r\n\"Culture,\" in the German idea, is the justification of a nation's\r\nexistence. Nationality has no other claim. Goethe, Luther, Kant, and\r\nBeethoven are Germany's title-deeds. A nation without a culture has no\r\nright to a \"place in the sun.\" \"History,\" says Wilamowitz in a lecture\r\ndelivered in 1898, \"knows nothing of any right to exist on the part of a\r\npeople or a language without a culture. If a people becomes dependent on a\r\nforeign culture\" (_i.e._ in the German idea, on a foreign civilisation) \"it\r\nmatters little if its lower classes speak a different language: they, too\r\n... must eventually go over to the dominant language.... Wisely to further\r\nthis necessary organic process is a blessing to all parties; violent\r\nhaste will only curb it and cause reactions. Importunate insistence on\r\nNationality has never anywhere brought true vitality into being, and often\r\ndestroyed vitality; but the superior Culture which, sure of its inner\r\nstrength, throws her doors wide open, can win men's hearts.\"[1] In the\r\nlight of a passage like this, from the most distinguished representative of\r\nGerman humanism, it is easier to grasp the failure of educated Germany to\r\nunderstand the sequel of the South African War, or the aspirations of the\r\nSlav peoples, or to stigmatise the folly of their statesmen in Poland,\r\nDenmark, Alsace-Lorraine, and Belgium. \"Importunate insistence on\r\nNationality\"--the words come home to us now with a new meaning when we\r\nlearn that in Belgium, now perforce \"dependent on a foreign culture,\"\r\nbabies are registered under German names and newspapers printed in \"the\r\ndominant language,\" and that already \"forty newspaper vendors in Brussels\r\nhave been sentenced to long terms of hard labour in German prisons for\r\nselling English, French, and Belgian newspapers.\"[2] \"Our fearless German\r\nwarriors,\" writes the leading German dramatist, Gerhart Hauptmann,[3]\r\n\"are _well aware of the reasons for which they have taken the field_. No\r\nilliterates will be found among them. Many of them, besides shouldering\r\ntheir muskets, carry their Goethe's _Faust_, some work of Schopenhauer, a\r\nBible, or a Homer in their knapsacks.\" Such is a serious German writer's\r\nidea of the way in which civilisation is diffused!\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Speeches and Lectures_, pp. 147-148 (1913 edition).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Daily Papers, October 12, 1914 (Exchange Telegram from\r\nRotterdam).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Letter quoted in the _Westminster Gazette._]\r\n\r\nWith such a philosophy of human progress as this, German thinkers and\r\nstatesmen look out into the future and behold nothing but conflict--eternal\r\nconflict between rival national \"cultures,\" each seeking to impose its\r\ndomination. \"In the struggle between Nationalities,\" writes Prince\r\nBülow,[1] in defence of his Polish policy, putting into a cruder form the\r\nphilosophy of Wilamowitz, \"one nation is the hammer and the other the\r\nanvil; one is the victor and the other the vanquished. It is a law of life\r\nand development in history that where two national civilisations meet they\r\nfight for supremacy.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Imperial Germany_, p. 245 (1st ed.).]\r\n\r\nHere we have the necessary and logical result of the philosophy of culture.\r\nIn the struggle between cultures no collaboration, no compromise even, is\r\npossible. German is German: Flemish is Flemish: Polish is Polish: French is\r\nFrench. Who is to decide which is the \"more civilised,\" which is the fitter\r\nto survive? Force alone can settle the issue. A Luther and Goethe may be\r\nthe puppets pitted in a contest of culture against Maeterlinck and Victor\r\nHugo. But it is Krupp and Zeppelin and the War-Lord that pull the strings.\r\nAs Wilamowitz reminds us, it was the Roman legions, not Virgil and Horace,\r\nthat stamped out the Celtic languages and romanised Western Europe. It is\r\nthe German army, two thousand years later, that is to germanise it. It is\r\nan old, old theory; Prussia did not invent it, nor even Rome. \"You know as\r\nwell as we do,\" said the Athenians in 416 B.C. to the representatives of\r\na small people of that day,[1] \"that right, as the world goes, is only in\r\nquestion between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the\r\nweak suffer what they must\"; and they went on, like the Kaiser, to claim\r\nthe favour of the gods, \"neither our pretensions nor our conduct being\r\nin any way contrary to what men believe of the gods, or practise amongst\r\nthemselves.\" There is, in fact, to be no Law between Nations but the Rule\r\nof the Stronger.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Thucydides_, Book v. 89 and 105.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§6. _The Principle of the Commonwealth_.--Such seems to many the meaning\r\nof the present European situation--a stern conflict between nations and\r\ncultures, to be decided by force of arms. The bridges between the nations\r\nseem broken down, and no one can tell when they will be repaired. The hopes\r\nthat had gathered round international movements, the cosmopolitan dreams\r\nof common action between the peoples across the barriers of States and\r\nGovernments, seem to have vanished into limbo; and the enthusiastic\r\ndreamers of yesterday are the disillusioned soldiers and spectators of\r\nto-day. Nationality, that strange, inarticulate, unanalysable force that\r\ncan call all men to her tents in the hour of crisis and danger, seems to\r\nhave overthrown the international forces of to-day, the Socialists, the\r\nPacifists, and, strongest of all, the Capitalists, as it overthrew Napoleon\r\nand his dreams of Empire a hundred years ago. What Law is there but force\r\nthat can decide the issue between nation and nation? And, in the absence\r\nof a Law, what becomes of all our hopes for international action, for the\r\nfuture of civilisation and the higher life of the human race?\r\n\r\nBut in truth the disillusionment is as premature as the hopes that preceded\r\nit. We are still far off from the World-State and the World-Law which\r\nformed the misty ideal of cosmopolitan thinkers. But only those who are\r\nblind to the true course of human progress can fail to see that the day of\r\nthe Nation-State is even now drawing to a close in the West. There is in\r\nfact at present working in the world a higher Law and a better patriotism\r\nthan that of single nations and cultures, a Law and a patriotism that\r\noverride and transcend the claims of Nationality in a greater, a more\r\ncompelling, and a more universal appeal. The great States or Powers of\r\nto-day, Great Britain, the United States, France, and (if they had eyes\r\nto sec it) Russia, Germany and Austria-Hungary, are not Nation-States but\r\ncomposite States--States compacted of many nationalities united together by\r\na common citizenship and a common law. Great Britain, the United States,\r\nthe German Empire, and Austria-Hungary bear in their very names the\r\nreminder of the diverse elements of which they are composed; but France\r\nwith her great African Empire, and Russia with her multitudinous\r\npopulations, from Poland to the Pacific, from Finland to the Caucasus, are\r\nequally composite. In each of these great States nations have been united\r\nunder a common law; and where the wisdom of the central government has not\r\n\"broken the bruised reed or quenched the smoking flax\" of national life,\r\nthe nations have been not only willing but anxious to join in the work\r\nof their State. Nations, like men, were made not to compete but to work\r\ntogether; and it is so easy, so simple, to win their good-hearted devotion.\r\nIt takes all sorts of men, says the old proverb, to make a world. It takes\r\nall sorts of nations to make a modern State. \"The combination of different\r\nnations in one State is as necessary a condition of civilised life as the\r\ncombination of men in society. ... It is in the cauldron of the State that\r\nthe fusion takes place by which the vigour, the knowledge, and the capacity\r\nof one portion of mankind may be communicated to another.... If we take the\r\nestablishment of liberty for the realisation of moral duties to be the end\r\nof civil society, we must conclude that those States are substantially the\r\nmost perfect which, like the British and Austrian Empires, include various\r\ndistinct nationalities without oppressing them.\" So wrote Lord Acton,\r\nthe great Catholic historian, fifty years ago, when the watchwords of\r\nNationality were on all men's lips, adding, in words that were prophetic of\r\nthe failure of the Austrian and the progress of the British Commonwealth\r\nof Nations: \"The coexistence of several nations under the same State _is a\r\ntest_ as well as the best security _of its freedom_. It is also one of the\r\nchief instruments of civilisation; and, as such, it is in the natural and\r\nprovidential order, and indicates a state of greater advancement than the\r\nnational unity which is the ideal of modern liberalism.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Essay on Nationality, in _The History of Freedom and other\r\nEssays_, pp. 290, 298.]\r\n\r\nOf the Great Powers which between them control the destinies of\r\ncivilisation Great Britain is at once the freest, the largest, and the\r\nmost various. If the State is a \"cauldron\" for mingling \"the vigour, the\r\nknowledge, and the capacity\" of the portions of mankind--or if, to use an\r\napter metaphor, it is a body whose perfection consists in the very variety\r\nof the functions of its several members--there has never been on the earth\r\na political organism like the British Empire. Its 433 million inhabitants,\r\nfrom Great Britain to Polynesia, from India and Egypt to Central Africa,\r\nare drawn from every division of the human race. Cut a section through\r\nmankind, and in every layer there will be British citizens, living under\r\nthe jurisdiction of British law. Here is something to hearten those who\r\nhave looked in vain to the Hague. While international law has been\r\nbrought to a standstill through the absence of a common will and a common\r\nexecutive, Great Britain has thrown a girdle of law around the globe.\r\n\r\n\r\n§7. _The Future of Civilisation_.--What hopes dare we cherish, in this hour\r\nof conflict, for the future of civilisation?\r\n\r\nThe great, the supreme task of human politics and statesmanship is to\r\nextend the sphere of Law. Let others labour to make men cultured or\r\nvirtuous or happy. These are the tasks of the teacher, the priest, and the\r\ncommon man. The statesman's task is simpler. It is to enfold them in a\r\njurisdiction which will enable them to live the life of their souls'\r\nchoice. The State, said the Greek philosophers, is the foundation of the\r\ngood life; but its crown rises far above mere citizenship. \"There where the\r\nState ends,\" cries Nietzsche,[1] echoing Aristotle and the great tradition\r\nof civilised political thought, \"there _men begin_. There, where the State\r\nends, look thither, my brothers! Do you not see the rainbow and the bridge\r\nto the Overman?\" Ever since organised society began, the standards of the\r\nindividual, the ideals of priest and teacher, the doctrines of religion and\r\nmorality, have outstripped the practice of statesmanship. For the polestar\r\nof the statesman has not been love, but law. His not the task of exhorting\r\nmen to love one another, but the simpler duty of enforcing the law, \"Thou\r\nshalt not kill.\" And in that simple, strenuous, necessary task statesmen\r\nand political thinkers have watched the slow extension of the power of Law,\r\nfrom the family to the tribe, from the tribe to the city, from the city to\r\nthe nation, from the nation to the Commonwealth. When will Law take its\r\nnext extension? When will warfare, which is murder between individuals and\r\n\"rebellion\" between groups of citizens, be equally preventable between\r\nnations by the common law of the world?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Also sprach Zarathustra_, Speech xi. (end).]\r\n\r\nThe answer is simple. When the world has a common will, and has created a\r\ncommon government to express and enforce that will.\r\n\r\nIn the sphere of science and invention, of industry and economics, as\r\nNorman Angell and others have taught us, the world is already one Great\r\nSociety. For the merchant, the banker, and the stockbroker political\r\nfrontiers have been broken down. Trade and industry respond to the\r\nreactions of a single, world-wide, nervous system. Shocks and panics pass\r\nas freely as airmen over borders and custom-houses. And not \"big business\"\r\nonly, but the humblest citizen, in his search for a livelihood, finds\r\nhimself caught in the meshes of the same world-wide network. \"The widow\r\nwho takes in washing,\" says Graham Wallas,[1] in his deep and searching\r\nanalysis of our contemporary life, \"fails or succeeds according to her\r\nskill in choosing starch or soda or a wringing machine under the influence\r\nof half a dozen competing world-schemes of advertisement.... The English\r\nfactory girl who is urged to join her Union, the tired old Scotch\r\ngatekeeper with a few pounds to invest, the Galician peasant when the\r\nemigration agent calls, the artisan in a French provincial town whose\r\nindustry is threatened by a new invention, all know that unless they find\r\ntheir way among world-wide facts, which only reach them through misleading\r\nwords, they will be crushed.\" The Industrial Revolution of the past\r\ncentury, steam-power and electricity, the railway and the telegraph, have\r\nknit mankind together, and made the world one place.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _The Great Society_ (1914), p. 4.]\r\n\r\nBut this new Great Society is as yet formless and inarticulate. It is not\r\nonly devoid of common leadership and a common government; it lacks even the\r\nbeginnings of a common will, a common emotion, and a common consciousness.\r\nOf the Great Society, consciously or unconsciously, we must all perforce be\r\nmembers; but of the Great State, the great World-Commonwealth, we do not\r\nyet discern the rudiments. The economic organisation of the world has\r\noutstripped the development of its citizenship and government: the economic\r\nman, with his farsighted vision and scientific control of the resources\r\nof the world, must sit by and see the work of his hands laid in ashes by\r\ncontending governments and peoples. No man can say how many generations\r\nmust pass before the platitudes of the market and the exchange pass into\r\nthe current language of politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n§8. _The Two Roads of Advance: Inter-State Action and Common\r\nCitizenship_.--In the great work which lies before the statesmen and\r\npeoples of the world for the extension of law and common citizenship and\r\nthe prevention of war there are two parallel lines of advance.\r\n\r\nOne road lies through the development of what is known as International,\r\nbut should more properly be called _Inter-State Law_, through the revival,\r\non a firmer and broader foundation, of the Concert of Europe conceived by\r\nthe Congress of Vienna just a hundred years ago--itself a revival, on\r\na secular basis, of the great mediaeval ideal of an international\r\nChristendom, held together by Christian Law and Christian ideals. That\r\nideal faded away for ever at the Reformation, which grouped Europe into\r\nindependent sovereign States ruled by men responsible to no one outside\r\ntheir own borders. It will never be revived on an ecclesiastical basis. Can\r\nwe hope for its revival on a basis of modern democracy, modern nationality,\r\nand modern educated public opinion? Can Inter-State Law, hitherto a mere\r\nshadow of the majestic name it bears, almost a matter of convention and\r\netiquette, with no permanent tribunal to interpret it, and no government\r\nto enforce it, be enthroned with the necessary powers to maintain justice\r\nbetween the peoples and governments of the world?\r\n\r\nSuch a Law the statesmen of Great Britain and Russia sought to impose on\r\nEurope in 1815, to maintain a state of affairs which history has shown to\r\nhave been intolerable to the European peoples. There are those who hope\r\nthat the task can be resumed, on a better basis, at the next Congress.\r\n\"Shall we try again,\" writes Professor Gilbert Murray,[1] \"to achieve\r\nCastlereagh's and Alexander's ideal of a permanent Concert, pledged to make\r\ncollective war upon the peace-breaker? Surely we must. We must, at all\r\ncosts and in spite of all difficulties, because the alternative means\r\nsuch unspeakable failure. We must learn to agree, we civilised nations of\r\nEurope, or else we must perish. I believe that the chief council of wisdom\r\nhere is to be sure to go far enough. We need a permanent Concert, perhaps a\r\npermanent Common Council, in which every awkward problem can be dealt with\r\nbefore it has time to grow dangerous, and in which outvoted minorities must\r\naccustom themselves to giving way.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Hibbert Journal,_ Oct. 1914, p. 77.]\r\n\r\nOther utterances by public men, such as Mr. Roosevelt and our own Prime\r\nMinister, might be cited in the same sense; but Professor Murray's has been\r\nchosen because he has had the courage to grasp the nettle. In his words the\r\ntrue position is quite clearly set forth. If Inter-State Law is to become\r\na reality we must \"be sure to go far enough.\" There is no half-way house\r\nbetween Law and no Law, between Government and no Government, between\r\nResponsibility and no Responsibility. If the new Concert is to be effective\r\nit must be able to compel the submission of all \"awkward problems\" and\r\ncauses of quarrel to its permanent Tribunal at the Hague or elsewhere; and\r\nit must be able to enforce the decision of its tribunal, employing for\r\nthe purpose, if necessary, the armed forces of the signatory Powers as an\r\ninternational police. \"Out-voted minorities must accustom themselves to\r\ngiving way.\" It is a bland and easy phrase; but it involves the whole\r\nquestion of world-government. \"Men must accustom themselves not to demand\r\nan eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,\" the earliest law-givers might\r\nhave said, when the State first intervened between individuals to make\r\nitself responsible for public order. Peace between the Powers, as between\r\nindividuals, is, no doubt, a habit to which cantankerous Powers \"must\r\naccustom themselves.\" But they will be sure to do so if there is a Law,\r\narmed with the force to be their schoolmaster towards peaceable habits. In\r\nother words, they will do so because they have surrendered one of the most\r\nvital elements in the independent life of a State--the right of conducting\r\nits own policy--to the jurisdiction of a higher Power. An Inter-State\r\nConcert, with a Judiciary of its own and an Army and Navy under its own\r\norders, is, in fact, not an Inter-State Concert at all; it is a new State:\r\nit is, in fact, the World-State. There is no middle course between Law and\r\nno Law: and the essence of Statehood, as we have seen, is a Common Law.\r\n\r\nWill this new State have the other attributes of Government--a Common\r\nLegislature and a Common Executive--as well as a Common Judiciary? Let us\r\ngo back to Professor Murray's words. He speaks of \"outvoted minorities.\"\r\nLet us suppose the refractory country to be Great Britain, outvoted on some\r\nquestion relating to sea-power. Of whom will the outvoted minority consist?\r\nOf the British members on the \"Common Council\" of the Concert. But the\r\nquestion at once arises, what are the credentials of these British members?\r\nWhom do they represent? To whom are they responsible? If they are the\r\nrepresentatives of the British people and responsible to the democracy\r\nwhich sent them, how can they be expected to \"accustom themselves to giving\r\nway\"--perhaps to a majority composed of the representatives of undemocratic\r\ngovernments? Their responsibility is, not to the Concert, but to their\r\nown Government and people. They are not the minority members of a\r\ndemocratically-elected Council of their own fellow-citizens. They are the\r\nminority members of a heterogeneous Council towards which they owe no\r\nallegiance and recognise no binding responsibility. There is no half-way\r\nhouse between Citizenship and no Citizenship, between Responsibility and\r\nno Responsibility. No man and no community can serve two masters. When the\r\npoint of conflict arises men and nations have to make the choice where\r\ntheir duty lies. Not the representatives of Great Britain on the\r\nInternational Concert, but the people of Great Britain themselves would\r\nhave to decide whether their real allegiance, as citizens, was due to the\r\nWorld-State or to their own Commonwealth: they would find themselves at the\r\nsame awful parting of the ways which confronted the people of the Southern\r\nStates in 1861. When at the outbreak of the Civil War General Lee was\r\noffered by Lincoln the Commandership of the Northern armies and refused\r\nit, to become the Commander-in-Chief on the side of the South, he did so\r\nbecause \"he believed,\" as he told Congress after the war, \"that the act of\r\nVirginia in withdrawing herself from the United States carried him along\r\nwith it as a citizen of Virginia, and that _her_ laws and acts were binding\r\non him.\" In other words, unless the proposed Common Council is to be made\r\nsomething more than a Council of the delegates of sovereign States (as the\r\nSouthern States believed themselves to be till 1861), a deadlock sooner or\r\nlater is almost inevitable, and the terrible and difficult question--so\r\nfamiliar to Americans and recently to ourselves on the smaller stage of\r\nUlster--of the right of secession and the coercion of minorities\r\nwill arise. But if the Common Council is framed in accordance with a\r\nConstitution which binds its representatives to accept its decisions and\r\nobey its government, then the World-State, with a World-Executive, will\r\nalready have come into being. There will be no more war, but only Rebellion\r\nand Treason.\r\n\r\nSuch is the real meaning of proposals to give a binding sanction to the\r\ndecisions of an Inter-State Concert. Anything short of this--treaties and\r\narbitration-agreements based upon inter-State arrangements without any\r\nexecutive to enforce them--may give relief for a time and pave the way\r\nfor further progress, but can in itself provide no permanent security, no\r\nsatisfactory justification for the neglect of defensive measures by the\r\nvarious sovereign governments on behalf of their peoples. Mr. Bryan, for\r\nthe United States, has within the last eighteen months concluded twenty-six\r\ngeneral arbitration treaties with different Governments, and may yet\r\nsucceed in his ambition of signing treaties with all the remainder. Yet no\r\none imagines that, when the immunity of the United States from attack is\r\nguaranteed by the promise of every Government in the world, America will\r\nrely for her defence upon those promises alone.\r\n\r\nIn discussing proposals for a European Council, then, we must be quite\r\nsure to face all that it means. But let us not reject Professor Murray's\r\nsuggestion off-hand because of its inherent difficulties: for that men\r\nshould be discussing such schemes at all marks a significant advance in our\r\npolitical thought. Only let us be quite clear as to what they presuppose.\r\nThey presuppose the supremacy, in the collective mind of civilised mankind,\r\nof Law over Force, a definite supremacy of what may be called the civilian\r\nas against the military ideal, not in a majority of States, but in every\r\nState powerful enough to defy coercion. They presuppose a world map\r\ndefinitely settled on lines satisfactory to the national aspirations of the\r\npeoples. They presuppose a _status quo_ which is not simply maintained,\r\nlike that after 1815, because it is a legal fact and its disturbance would\r\nbe inconvenient to the existing rulers, but because it is inherently\r\nequitable.[1] They presuppose a similar democratic basis of citizenship\r\nand representation among the component States. They presuppose, lastly,\r\nan educated public opinion incomparably less selfish, less ignorant, less\r\nunsteady, less materialistic, and less narrowly national than has been\r\nprevalent hitherto. Let us work and hope for these things: let us use our\r\nbest efforts to remove misunderstandings and promote a sense of common\r\nresponsibilities and common trusteeship for civilisation between the\r\npeoples of all the various sovereign States; but meanwhile let us work\r\nalso, with better hopes of immediate if less ambitious successes, along the\r\nother parallel road of advance.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The same applies to proposals for ensuring permanent peace in\r\nthe industrial sphere. Neither capital nor labour will abide by \"scraps\r\nof paper\" if they do not feel the _status quo (i.e._ the conditions under\r\nwhich wage-contracts are made) to be equitable and inherently just.]\r\n\r\nThe other road may seem, in this hour of dreams and disaster, of extremes\r\nof hope and disillusionment, a long and tedious track: it is the old slow\r\nhigh road of civilisation, not the short cut across the fields. It looks\r\nforward to abiding results, not through the mechanical co-operation of\r\ngovernments, but through the growth of an organic citizenship, through the\r\neducation of the nations themselves to a sense of common duty and a common\r\nlife. It looks forward, not to the definite establishment, in our day, of\r\nthe World-State, but only to the definite refutation of the wicked\r\ntheory of the mutual incompatibility of nations. It looks forward to the\r\nexpression in the outward order of the world's government of what we may\r\ncall \"the Principle of the Commonwealth,\" of Lord Acton's great principle\r\nof the State composed of free nations, of the State as a living body which\r\nlives through the organic union and free activity of its several national\r\nmembers. And it finds its immediate field of action in the deepening and\r\nextension of the obligations of citizenship among the peoples of the great,\r\nfree, just, peace-loving, supra-national Commonwealths whose patriotism has\r\nbeen built up, not by precept and doctrine, but on a firm foundation of\r\nolder loyalties.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the Commonwealth is not a European principle: it is a\r\nworld-principle. It does not proceed upon the expectation of a United\r\nStates of Europe; for all the Great Powers of Europe except Austria-Hungary\r\n(and some of the smaller, such as Holland, Belgium, and Portugal) are\r\nextra-European Powers also. Indeed if we contract our view, with Gladstone\r\nand Bismarck and the statesmen of the last generation, to European issues\r\nalone, we shall be ignoring the chief political problem of our age--the\r\ncontact of races and nations with wide varieties of social experience and\r\nat different levels of civilisation. It is this great and insistent problem\r\n(call it the problem of East and West, or the problem of the colour-line)\r\nin all its difficult ramifications, political, social, and, above all,\r\neconomic, which makes the development of the principle of the Commonwealth\r\nthe most pressing political need of our age. For the problems arising out\r\nof the contact of races and nations can never be adjusted either by the\r\nwise action of individuals or by conflict and warfare; they can only be\r\nsolved by fair and deliberate statesmanship within the bosom of a single\r\nState, through the recognition by both parties of a higher claim than their\r\nown sectional interest--the claim of a common citizenship and the interest\r\nof civilisation.[1] It is here, in the union and collaboration of diverse\r\nraces and peoples, that the principle of the Commonwealth finds its\r\npeculiar field of operation. Without this principle, and without its\r\nexpression, however imperfect, in the British Empire, the world would be in\r\nchaos to-day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The most recent example of this is the settlement of the very\r\ndifficult dispute between India and South Africa.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot predict the political development of the various Great Powers who\r\nbetween them control the destinies of civilisation. We cannot estimate\r\nthe degree or the manner in which France, freed at last from nearer\r\npreoccupations, will seek to embody in her vast dominion the great\r\ncivilising principles for which her republic stands. We cannot foretell\r\nthe issue of the conflict of ideas which has swayed to and fro in Russia\r\nbetween the British and the Prussian method of dealing with the problem of\r\nnationality. Germany, Italy, Japan--here, too, we are faced by enigmas.\r\nOne other great Commonwealth remains besides the British. Upon the United\r\nStates already lies the responsibility, voluntarily assumed and, except\r\nduring a time of internal crisis,[1] successfully discharged, of securing\r\npeace from external foes for scores of millions of inhabitants of the\r\nAmerican continent. Yet with the progress of events her responsibilities\r\nmust yearly enlarge: for both the immigrant nationalities within and the\r\nworld-problems without her borders seem to summon her to a deeper education\r\nand to wider obligations.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: French occupation of Mexico, 1862, during the American Civil\r\nWar, when the Monroe Doctrine was temporarily in abeyance.]\r\n\r\nBut upon the vast, ramifying, and inchoate Commonwealth of Great Britain\r\nlies the heaviest responsibility. It is a task unequally shared between\r\nthose of her citizens who are capable of discharging it. Her task within\r\nthe Commonwealth is to maintain the common character and ideals and to\r\nadjust the mutual relations of one quarter of the human race. Her task\r\nwithout is to throw her weight into the scales of peace, and to uphold and\r\ndevelop the standard and validity of inter-State agreements. It is a task\r\nwhich requires, even at this time of crisis, when, by the common sentiment\r\nof her citizens, the real nature and purpose of the Commonwealth have\r\nbecome clear to us, the active thoughts of all political students. For to\r\nbring home to all within her borders who bear rule and responsibility, from\r\nthe village headman in India and Nigeria, the Basutu chief and the\r\nSouth Sea potentate, to the public opinion of Great Britain and the\r\nself-governing Dominions, the nature of the British Commonwealth, and the\r\ncharacter of its citizenship and ideals, and to study how those ideals\r\nmay be better expressed in its working institutions and executive\r\ngovernment--that is a task to which the present crisis beckons the minds\r\nof British citizens, a task which Britain owes not only to herself but to\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n_Note_.--A friendly critic who saw this chapter in MS. remarked: \"I think\r\nthe author has been very successful in ignoring some of the shady methods\r\nby which the British Empire has been extended.\" The criticism is not\r\nstrictly relevant to the subject of the chapter, but as it may occur to\r\nother readers it may be well to deal with it in a brief note. I would\r\nanswer:\r\n\r\n(1) The \"shady methods\" of which he speaks were not the result of British\r\nImperialism, or of a desire for conquest on the part of the British\r\nState. They were the result, melancholy but inevitable, of the contact of\r\nindividuals and races at different levels of development. This contact\r\nbetween the stronger and the weaker (which can be illustrated from what is\r\nsaid about the sandalwood traders in the New Hebrides on p. 215 above) was\r\nthe direct result of the explorations of the sixteenth century, which threw\r\nthe seas of the world open to Western pioneers and traders. The extension\r\nof the authority of Western _governments_ (Spanish, Portuguese, Dutch,\r\nFrench, and British), and the collisions between them, followed inevitably\r\non the activities of their citizens, as has been pointed out on p. 216\r\nabove. All the Western governments have made mistakes in dealing with this\r\nunfamiliar situation; but the wise course for democratic public opinion,\r\ninstead of railing at \"Imperialism,\" would seem to be to familiarise itself\r\nwith its problems and control its injurious tendencies.\r\n\r\n(2) In any case, the mistakes of the past do not entitle us to wash our\r\nhands of responsibilities in the present. This war has shown that the\r\nnon-self-governing parts of the Commonwealth are not, as our enemies\r\nsupposed, a weakness to Great Britain in time of trouble, but a strength.\r\nIn other words, whatever may have happened in the past, Great Britain\r\nhas now won the consent of the ruled to the fact--not necessarily to the\r\nmethods--of British rule. To use what is doubtless unduly constitutional\r\nlanguage, we are now faced in India and elsewhere, not with a Revolutionary\r\nMovement, but with an Opposition. That is a great incentive to further\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOKS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF VIOLENCE\r\n\r\nBERNHARDI, _Germany and the Next War_ (2s.), has become familiar. But this\r\nis only one _application_ of a doctrine which has found expression in many\r\nspheres, as, for example, in the writings of the French Syndicalists, who\r\nclaim to be copying the _methods_ of Capitalism, and the _principles_ of\r\nBergson's philosophy--with what justification must be left to the reader\r\nto determine. See G. SOREL, _Reflexions sur la Violence_ (Paris, Marcel\r\nRivière, 1910, 5 francs), and Sorel's other writings. \"Bernhardi-ism\" is,\r\nin fact, not a German product: it has been before the public for some years\r\nunder the name of \"militancy,\" in connection with various causes, though\r\nit has never been put into execution on so tremendous a scale as by the\r\nPrussian Government. Nor is its philosophical basis to be found only, if at\r\nall, in Nietzsche.\r\n\r\n\r\nKULTUR\r\n\r\nThe insistence on \"Culture\" as the main factor in the life and development\r\nof peoples is to be found in practically every German history, and in a\r\ngreat many non-German writers. It has received an additional vogue from\r\nthe development of the study of _Sociology_, which naturally seeks out, in\r\ntracing the development of societies in the past, the elements which lend\r\nthemselves to measurement and description, and these are inevitably, from\r\nthe nature of the evidence, rather \"cultural\" than moral. It would be\r\ninvidious to mention instances.\r\n\r\n\r\nEDUCATION\r\n\r\nFor Dr. SADLER'S articles see p. 119, above. See also PAULSEN, _German\r\nEducation: Past and Present._ 1908. 5s. net.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRINCIPLE OF THE COMMONWEALTH\r\n\r\nThe best philosophical book on the relations of advanced and backward races\r\nis _The Basis of Ascendancy: a Discussion of certain Principles of Public\r\nPolicy involved in the Development of the Southern States,_ by EDGAR\r\nGARDNER MURPHY (a clergyman living at Montgomery, Alabama) (1909, 6s. net).\r\nThough written with reference to the peculiar American problem, the book\r\nhas a far wider significance. There is no good book which covers the ground\r\neither on India or the British Empire. E.R. BEVAN'S little volume on\r\n_Indian Nationalism_ (2s. 6d. net) may be mentioned. An article on _India\r\nand the Empire_ in the _Round Table_ for September 1912 is also worth\r\nmention (and worth reprinting).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT SOCIETY\r\n\r\nWALLAS, _The Great Society_ (1914, 7s. 6d. net), and NORMAN ANGELL, _The\r\nGreat Illusion_ (1910, 2s. 6d. net), are the standard works--the former as\r\na psychologist and a philosopher, the latter as a pamphleteer with a very\r\nacute vision within a limited field.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL LAW\r\n\r\nSee LINDSAY, _The War against War_ (Oxford pamphlets, 2d.), a model of\r\nclear argument, so far as it goes. Also ALISON PHILLIPS, _The Confederation\r\nof Europe: A Study of the European Alliance, 1813-1823, as an Experiment\r\nin the International Organisation of Peace,_ (1914, 7s. 6d. net), the\r\nbest book on the Congress of Vienna and the problems connected with it,\r\nespecially on the subject of an International Tribunal and Universal Peace.\r\nThe Prime Minister's speeches will be familiar.
