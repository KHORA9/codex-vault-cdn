Morris\r\nSecretary to Governor Cox\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE NEED FOR A DOER\r\n\r\n\r\nThere come times in the affairs of men which call for \"not a\r\nforgetful hearer, but a doer of the work.\"  Such a time is at\r\nhand.  A great war, the most devastating in history, has been\r\nconcluded.  Its moral lesson has been taught by its master minds\r\nand learned in penitence, we may hope, by the erring and wrongly\r\nwillful.  But the fruits of victory are ungathered and the\r\nbeneficence of peace is not yet attained.  The call arises for a\r\n\"doer of the work.\"\r\n\r\nTwo great political parties in the United States, both with\r\nsplendid accomplishments behind them and both with grave\r\nmistakes as well, have attempted to respond to this call, and\r\nAmerica, whose proudest boast is that it has always found a man\r\nfor every great occasion, chooses between them.  It is a solemn\r\nand serious hour.  For it has been America's special fortune that\r\nits great teachers and leaders and doers have been found at just\r\nthe proper time.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge of the certain right decision of our country is,\r\nwe might almost say, a part of its very fiber abiding with the\r\npersistency of a fixed idea, a part of the heritage of the\r\nnation, scarcely needing to be taught in the schools, obvious\r\neven to the casual student from an alien land.  For our\r\nhistorical records glow with the stories of the appearance of\r\n_the_ man; and the thought of a friendly destiny seems not easy\r\nto banish.  Time has given so often either the inspired teacher\r\nof the word or the doer of the work that there is more than a\r\nfaith and a hope, nay almost a conviction, that it cannot fail\r\nnow when the agonized appeal of the world beckons America to\r\ncomplete her high mission to humanity upon which she embarked\r\nwhen she threw her power and might on the scales in war.\r\n\r\nThose who insist that the fulfillment of that mission lies in\r\nkeeping the solemn promises make in France, accepted by friend\r\nand foe alike, for a League of Nations to end war, to see that\r\nretribution becomes not blind vengeance, to set the tribes of\r\nthe earth again on their forward journey, present as their\r\nleader James Monroe Cox, Governor of Ohio.\r\n\r\nA party of traditions, a party that has directed in every\r\ncritical period save one since the Republic began, has said that\r\nhe meets the requirements of the time.  That party chose him\r\nbecause of his record for doing, because there was an inner\r\nconviction that he could enter upon a still larger field with a\r\ngrowing, an ever-expanding capacity.\r\n\r\nThis, too, furnishes a fitter chapter in the history of country\r\nand party.  For the wise selection of men, even obscure men, has\r\nbeen the tower of our national strength.  America had her Thomas\r\nJefferson to expound for all the world the real underlying truth\r\nof her Revolution.  The equality of rights and duties spread from\r\na dream of philosophers to be the doctrine of warriors for\r\nfreedom.  There was her George Washington to hold together the\r\ntenuous bands of freedom.  She found her James Monroe to lay the\r\nfoundations of the doctrine that stern moral precepts forbid the\r\nviolation of sovereign rights of the nations.  She brought forth\r\nher Andrew Jackson to make the country in his time safe for\r\ndemocracy, and to establish for all time that no single money\r\nbaron, nor yet any collection of them, is superior to the power\r\nof all the people.\r\n\r\nIn later time she had her Abraham Lincoln, now in the judgment\r\nof the succeeding generations but little beneath the Savior of\r\nmen, preserver of the Union for its larger duties.  She had in\r\nthis day her Woodrow Wilson, builder of the newer policy of\r\nworld union and recognized spokesman of freedom in the death\r\nstruggle with military autocracy.  It is of history that Lincoln\r\nand Wilson both were stricken down with their work incomplete.\r\nAfter Lincoln there was no doer of the work to finish his task\r\nand the evil of those who perverted the exalted purpose of the\r\nCivil War continues even unto this day.\r\n\r\nComing into the arena of national affairs when even America\r\nseems to doubt and when the selfish motive of fear threatens to\r\npalsy the nation's hand, Governor Cox became the man to\r\nvindicate the statements and the pledges given before all the\r\nworld.  His introduction to the conscience and intellect of the\r\ncountry was a demand that the faith be kept.\r\n\r\nOut of the night of war, the League of Nations has long been a\r\nsupreme issue with Governor Cox and he was chosen to carry the\r\nstandard because he had expressed the sentiment most strongly,\r\nmost clearly and with greatest emphasis.\r\n\r\nDoers have ever been practical men, and such is Governor Cox.\r\nBut practicality need not, and does not, imply a lack of vision.\r\nThere is such a thing as ideality in vision and a practical hand\r\nto make good the picture of the mind.  The combined qualities are\r\nconsidered as essentials to the adequate man of the times, for a\r\nvision of a new world order is the rarest gift of the century,\r\nbut the man with the dynamic force and the cunning skill to make\r\nthis new dream come true has been wanting.\r\n\r\nHistory--political history--was changed profoundly when\r\nPresident Woodrow Wilson was stricken.  Men were slow in rallying\r\nto his cause, there were even clouds of doubt, ominous and\r\ndisturbing, when the party he led to two victories prepared in\r\nthe late June and the early July days of the year 1920 to state\r\nits position, its hope and its aspirations.\r\n\r\nIn the state in which Governor Cox held leadership there was no\r\ndoubt.  His own Ohio knew long ago that at the Democratic\r\nNational Convention in San Francisco its chosen spokesmen would\r\ncommunicate but two mandates on behalf of the vast majority of\r\nthe people.  One was that Ohio could do no less than be faithful\r\nto its greatest executive and the other was that the nation's\r\nfaith and honor must be kept stainless.\r\n\r\nThrough Governor Cox that message has been sent to the length\r\nand breadth of the land.  As seen by him, the appeal to the\r\nAmerican people is one which began with the first plea to the\r\nworld powers for such a concert as would banish the continual\r\nthreat of war.  This plea was made to warring powers when the\r\nWorld War began in 1914 and it was renewed at each favorable\r\nopportunity during the years when America hoped that the war\r\nmight be brought to an end before the last great neutral power\r\nwas drawn into it.  Heeded by the Allies, the voice of reason was\r\nrejected by the Central Empires, and from that hour there came\r\nthe conviction among the earnest lovers of peace that only the\r\nimposition of peace would furnish a new basis for world concord.\r\n\r\nFew men were more downcast than this same man when long and\r\nvexatious delays in the United States Senate ended at last in\r\nthe recalcitrant refusal of the masters of the majority to\r\nratify the Treaty of Versailles.  It is but a fair and truthful\r\nstatement to observe that, although his judgment of the mind of\r\nthe people told him that the party which went before the country\r\nto vindicate the sacrifices of the men in the trenches would\r\nhave a most compelling issue, he had no wish for such partisan\r\nadvantage.  As a Democrat, history will tell that he sought only\r\nfair compromise on the treaty, even suggesting any honest\r\nsettlement that would hasten America's entrance into the League.\r\n\r\nIn his address of acceptance, then, Governor Cox stepped to the\r\nfore with the tersest of utterances as to his position on the\r\nLeague, compressing it all into \"I favor going in.\"\r\n\r\nIf this question is not answered now and affirmatively, Governor\r\nCox believes that there may be delay until nations once more\r\nhave borne their crosses on Calvary and until further blood and\r\ntreasure are wasted.  And so he says now:  \"I favor going in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nCOX THE MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nMen of great versatility are most difficult to picture\r\ncomprehensively.  Perhaps this is the reason that no pen-portrait\r\nof Theodore Roosevelt ever seemed quite complete.  There was in\r\nevery single sketch something that seemed to be left unsaid, a\r\npoint made by one was certain to be omitted by another.  Cox is a\r\nman after the Roosevelt type.  They were fast friends and they\r\nhad many ideas in common.  They often exchanged views upon\r\nprogressive issues and found themselves largely in accord.\r\nNeither was static in mental processes and their dynamics were\r\noften of the same sort.\r\n\r\nBut while Governor Cox's intimates compare him often with\r\nRoosevelt, they prefer to liken him to Andrew Jackson.  For Cox\r\nis the true Twentieth Century Jacksonian, they say.  Like Andrew\r\nJackson, Governor Cox can improvise the organization of a\r\npolitical campaign better than any man of his time, save Colonel\r\nRoosevelt, and the masterful Colonel won only when he had great\r\nresources at his command.  Cox seems to have reached back into\r\nhistory and grasped the idea of the manner in which Jackson's\r\nmen worked with resources so small that they had to pass\r\nnewspapers of their faith from hand to hand.\r\n\r\nLargely, it seems, because no war came along when he was free of\r\nfamily responsibilities Governor Cox has no martial record.  He\r\nmight have been a soldier of the Roosevelt type had he lived in\r\nother circumstances but his youth was spent in the drudgery of\r\ntoil and there was no chance for education in a military\r\nacademy.\r\n\r\nStill they call him \"fighting Jimmy,\" and those who have been\r\nthrough a campaign with him know what they mean.  As a boy there\r\nwas never need to drive him forward to personal combat and in\r\nthe man the juvenile tendency continued until he was well past\r\nthe forty-five-year mark of middle age.\r\n\r\nIf one were to inventory his external features there would\r\nappear a compact, muscular individual of about five feet six\r\ninches in height and of one hundred and seventy pounds in\r\nweight, every ounce keyed up to the efficiency of successful\r\nperformance. motions indicate a man of quick decision, a\r\ntendency to suddenness that many older than he have sought to\r\ncheck in his earlier years.  It is a proverb among those who know\r\nhim best that when Governor Cox makes an instant decision he may\r\nbe mistaken but that when he thinks it over for a single night\r\nhe is never wrong.  As the years in a varied experience have\r\npassed this disposition to think everything over has grown and\r\ngrown until snap judgments no longer are taken.  This may be the\r\nreason why men say that he has improved as an executive from\r\nyear to year and why his later acts and deeds have the rounded\r\nout and complete aspect that is lacking in the earlier.  The\r\nnature of Cox himself is for \"action,\" even when it seems to\r\ntake the form of experiment.  In simple justice it must be said\r\nthat he has never been an adventurer, but he is willing to\r\ntackle problems before other would seize hold of them.  His first\r\nadministration, he thinks, was his best, for much more was done,\r\nbut his last is his best, Ohio judgment has decided, because it\r\nrepressed tendencies to go the wrong way, taking perhaps the\r\nGladstone view that a statesman deserves more credit for\r\ndefeating unwise legislation than for securing the enactment of\r\ngood.  As Governor, Cox has been willing to risk defeat for\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nA trait of character is told in the story of school and taxation\r\nlegislation.  He was warned that progressive steps would\r\nencompass his defeat.  If a composite answer could be formed to\r\nall the suggestions of this sort, it would be something like\r\nthis:  \"There is need for improving our schools.  Time will\r\nvindicate it.\"\r\n\r\nSomething else of character may be learned from the manner in\r\nwhich Governor Cox redeems pledges.  When he was sorely beset by\r\nhis political foes in 1914, it was represented to him that the\r\nliquor interests might be made to do service if licenses were\r\nwithheld until after the election.  And the answer given was\r\nsomething like this:  \"The pledge was given that the license\r\nsystem shall not be prostituted to partisanship.  That pledge\r\nwill be redeemed.\"\r\n\r\nThe forebodings of the worldly wise were not disappointed.  The\r\nliquor interests contributed heavily to the opposition candidate\r\nand supported him so well that he won the election.\r\n\r\nCox hates war even if he made a remarkable record as war\r\nGovernor.  But he likes the smoke and fury of political contest,\r\nand he thrives on campaigns.  He has a fashion of leading his\r\nparty organization and making it do his will, and like all men\r\nor this sort, he has been accused of being dictatorial.  Yet none\r\ndenies that he gives a fair hearing and is open to conviction on\r\ndisputed issues.\r\n\r\nHe has a power of expression in a few words, portraying a whole\r\nfield of action.  Tending to go into great detail in public\r\nmatters, he comes to the heart of an issue with a laconic\r\nexpression that tells all there is to be told.  \"I favor going\r\nin\"--on the League of Nations is one.  Assuring his supporters\r\nthat the proposal for separate peace with Germany was \"opening\r\ntheir front lines,\" he drew a word sketch of a gigantic contest\r\nin which he as a general had sensed a rift in the opposition\r\nranks and had broken through a whole army.\r\n\r\nAssociates of Governor Cox say that he is daring because of his\r\nstrong sense of justice.  The question is frequently asked by him\r\nas to whether a proposition is fair to all sides.  Readiness to\r\ntrust in him as an arbitrator has brought many issues to his\r\ndesk that are not part of a Governor's official duties.  Disputes\r\nbetween interests and differences among organizations, no less\r\nthan capital and labor disagreements have been left to his\r\ndecision.  It is an evidence of the trust in the sense of justice\r\nin the man.\r\n\r\nThere is a notable habit in him of picking men quickly for\r\ntasks.  It is not claimed for him that he has never made mistakes\r\nin his estimate of men, but they are comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nGovernor Cox is the only man ever nominated for President who\r\nowns wealth--real wealth.  His personal fortune is handsome.  That\r\nwas a point of criticism when he began to get acquainted with\r\nthe country, but it is no longer.  The reason is to be found in\r\nthe fact that he has a natural appeal that makes his associates\r\nforget money.  Nor is the charge ever seriously made that his\r\nbroad sympathy is affected.  When he is best known, the wealth he\r\nowns is least often mentioned.\r\n\r\nThey do not refer to a wealthy man whose possessions are an\r\noutstanding attribute as \"Jim\" or \"Jimmy.\"  Cox, the man of\r\naffairs, is overshadowed by \"Jimmy Cox.\"\r\n\r\nAs with all powerful leaders, no sketch would be complete if it\r\ndid not allude to a certain imperiousness that is in the man.\r\nThis quality has made foes but that was inevitable.  One who has\r\nrisen by his own efforts has had the pushing impulse, of course.\r\n\r\nIt tells something of the Cox character that he has become a\r\nforceful speaker only in the last ten years.  When he first\r\nentered public life in 1908 his style in speaking lacked force\r\nand his manner was hesitating and uncertain.  A course of self-\r\ndiscipline and training led to constant improvement, and while\r\nthere has never been a pretense of oratorical flight, issues and\r\nquestions are discussed plainly and effectively.  There is a\r\npenchant for reducing statements to simple and understandable\r\nterms and for stating his conviction with a measure of\r\naggressiveness that carries conviction.\r\n\r\nAs a candidate he has always believed that the people are\r\nentitled to the fullest information possible and to see and hear\r\nthose who seek their suffrage.\r\n\r\nLike Roosevelt, the more strenuous sports and recreations\r\nattract him far more that does the swinging of the golf stick.\r\nHe is an expert marksman and has astonished military men on the\r\nrifle range by what he can do with a gun.  His ancestors were\r\nsquirrel-hunters, and his sure eye was an inheritance from them.\r\nThe Governor likes to rough it in the Northern Canadian woods,\r\nspending at leisure a couple of weeks with only his son, James\r\nM. Jr., now a boy of 18, for his companion.  He prides himself\r\nupon his ability to cook a fish after it is caught, and to\r\nplunge in the lake as an evidence of his swimming ability.  When\r\nin Columbus his form of exercise is walking, and younger men of\r\nsedentary pursuits find that he can tire them.\r\n\r\nQuitting school at an early age, Cox's education has been\r\nacquired through much private study.  He knows no language except\r\nEnglish.  His range of reading covers a wide variety of topics,\r\nthe favorite of which are the political sciences, and outdoor\r\nlife.  He does not lay claim to literary excellence or perfection\r\nof style, and is a man of serious bent of mind, speaking only\r\nwhen he thinks he has a message to carry.\r\n\r\nThe name under which he has been known to the country, James\r\nMiddleton Cox, seems to be an error which only lately his\r\nfriends have corrected.  In the old family Bible the name of\r\nJames Monroe Cox appears, indicative of a family admiration.  The\r\nname which appears signed to all official documents is James M.\r\nCox.  The Middleton seems to have had its origin in a bit of\r\njournalistic levity, probably having reference to Middletown,\r\nOhio, the city in which he got his early training as a newspaper\r\nreporter.\r\n\r\nThe Governor's family consists of his wife, a little daughter,\r\nAnne, who is slightly less than a year old, a married daughter,\r\nMrs. Daniel J. Mahoney of Dayton, and two sons, James M. Jr.,\r\nand John, age ten.\r\n\r\nWhile the Governor's devotion to the equal suffrage cause has\r\nbeen of many years' standing, the interests of Mrs. Cox are of a\r\ndomestic nature.  The time not devoted to her baby daughter is\r\nspent in the outdoors, he hobby being her garden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWHY COX IS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT\r\n\r\n\r\nJames M. Cox is a candidate for President because he hopes to be\r\nthe instrument of divine Providence in a great accomplishment.\r\nHe knows that the man who secures America's adherence to the\r\nLeague of Nations is as certain of a permanent place in the\r\nscrolls of fame as those who laid the foundations of freedom or\r\nthose who preserved it in the days of fiery trial.  To a famous\r\ncorrespondent, Mr. Herbert Corey, who put the question, \"Why do\r\nyou wish to be President?\" The Governor has answered:  \"It\r\naffords an opportunity to take hold of a knotty situation (the\r\nLeague) by the back of the neck and seat of the pants and shake\r\na result out of it.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer rings true to the man.  The candidate has called it an\r\nissue of supreme faith, elaborating his views in a recent\r\ncommunication to the \"Christian Herald,\" in which he has said:\r\n\r\n\"'Fighting the good fight of faith'--these words from the\r\nepistle to Timothy might well be our text for this campaign\r\nbefore the American people, which, within the limits of our\r\nstrength, has been carried to every fireside in this broad land\r\nof ours.  Ours is a fight of faith--faith with a world that\r\naccepted our statement of unselfish purpose, faith with fathers\r\nand mothers, wives and loved ones, who gave their sons, husbands\r\nand brothers to war upon war, faith with those who made\r\nsacrifice in homes, faith with those who toiled, faith with the\r\nliving and faith with the dead.\r\n\r\n\"If there were in this contest nothing but the question of\r\nwhether one or the other of two editors should sit in the seat\r\nof power, nothing but whether one organization or another should\r\ntaste the sweets of office, we could not insist that there is\r\ninvolved a fight of faith.  There is, indeed, an issue between\r\ntwo views of government, one looking forward and the other\r\nbackward.  But temporary control by one side or the other for a\r\nbrief period of four years is not necessarily a supreme matter\r\nof faith.  We might try one or we might, in a spirit of\r\nexperiment, try another.\r\n\r\n\"In speaking of this we would have our personal fortunes\r\nforgotten.  They are of transient interest to ourselves and we\r\nmight say of less interest to others.  To hold the exalted office\r\nof President of the United States, to occupy the place of\r\nWashington, of Jefferson, of Lincoln, to be looked to for\r\nleadership in public questions, to be the first citizen in this\r\ngreat land is not a trifling but a gigantic ambition, worthy of\r\nall honest striving but involving, in the ordinary sense, no\r\nsupreme issue.  So if personal reasons only animated us, we could\r\nnot muster the temerity to state our case with the ardent zeal\r\nthat controls us.\r\n\r\n\"But the motives that guide us are of greater import.  As leader\r\nof a great organization which has had its part in interpreting\r\nthe aspirations of the American people, and in shaping\r\nAmericanism through the generations we have been invested with a\r\nsacred commission, a mandate sanctified by the reckless bravery\r\nof our sons and ennobled by the heart impulses of our daughters.\r\nThrough circumstances not of our own choosing we have become the\r\ncustodians of the honor of the nation, we have been called to\r\nfight the good fight of faith.\r\n\r\n\"We as a party willed otherwise.  In the face of bigoted denials\r\nof our good faith we sought only concord of all our people in\r\nthe tasks of American in the world.  There was glory enough for\r\nall and we never advanced the claim that it was a partisan matter\r\nuntil the fact had been established through long and weary\r\nmonths of purposeful misunderstanding and unconscionable\r\nintrigue for party advantage by our opponents.  There is in this\r\nno suggestion of unkind sentiments toward our leading\r\nadversaries.  We can utter the sentiment voiced on the hill above\r\nJerusalem and when America has come to understand we stand ready\r\nto blot out a dark chapter of our national life and to pronounce\r\na pardon upon a course of conduct charitably covered by 'they\r\nknow not what they do.'\r\n\r\n\"There ought to be in this a special appeal to believers in the\r\nliving faith.  Its purpose to give to all the universal benefits\r\nonly a share of which it claims for itself, its conception of\r\nthe Golden Rule as the practical basis for dealings with the\r\nworld, its high plan to save the weak and feeble from the power\r\nand will of the mighty--these things, we say, are of the very\r\nessence of the true faith.\r\n\r\n\"It is not a subject for marvel then that practically every\r\ndenominational and interdenominational gathering of religious\r\nmen that has been held since the Versailles covenant was adopted\r\nhas included an endorsement of that great document.  Aloof from\r\nthe contentions of partisans, freed from the bigotry engendered\r\nby factionalism, looking upon national questions through the\r\nwindows of light and truth, the banded followers of the Man of\r\nNazareth have seen the question that is presented shorn of false\r\nclaims.  In a word, Christians, speaking organically, with a\r\nvoice that could not be misunderstood have stated that they wish\r\nthe League of Nations.\r\n\r\n\"For such a League, for the only league now in existence or\r\nwhich has a fair chance of coming into existence, we are\r\ncontending.  Could the question be lifted from the arena of\r\npartisanship and could the referendum which we have invoked be\r\nby direct ballot, there would be no opposition.  Unfortunately,\r\nour system of government has not provided a choice so direct,\r\nnor a manner of expression that would leave so small doubt as to\r\nthe sentiment of America.  We say this from a field of personal\r\nexperience for like the certain rich young man of Biblical\r\nstory, we, too, have seen the type of uncompromising partisan\r\nwho 'turned away sorrowfully' for party seemed more important\r\nthan duty or honor.\r\n\r\n\"It matters little whether we say that we feel deeply for those\r\nacross the seas in their troubles when we fail to act in their\r\nbehalf.  The successful issue of the war left a duty on our\r\nhands, a duty like that which we performed in Cuba nearly a\r\ngeneration ago and like that which has been brought close to\r\ncompletion in the Philippines.  We faced a Christian duty toward\r\nour associates and even toward the people of enemy lands.  It was\r\nour obligation to bind up the wounds of the war and to show by\r\nexample the fulfillment of high ideals voiced by the leaders of\r\nthe world thought.\r\n\r\n\"There came to us the divine opportunity to act quickly and with\r\nhigh Christian purposes.  We might with one stroke have become\r\nthe counselor and friend of all humanity, its guarantor that all\r\nthe forces of morality would be enlisted upon the side of peace.\r\nBut the precious moments were wasted in fruitless discussion, in\r\nidle bickerings, in invention of fancied situations, purposely\r\nforgetting that the great purpose of the League of Nations was\r\nto band the world together in a great brotherhood against war.\r\nWe were to lead the nations back to peaceful ways but through\r\nour own wavering we actually, by reason or a small coterie of\r\nmen, we think wrongly advised, have drenched Europe and Asia\r\nwith new wars.\r\n\r\n\"The great heart of America has always been right upon this\r\ngreat issue.  There has never been a time when associations of\r\nmen and women, independent of partisanship, have turned from the\r\nLeague proposal.  America gave freely in alms to every war-torn\r\nnation in the world.  She sent her devoted bands of workers to\r\nrelieve distress.  She sent her nurses to heal the sick.  She sent\r\nher contributions to feed the hungry.  She opened her warehouses\r\nto clothe the naked.  She willingly gave her talent, through\r\nprivate auspices, to help bring life back to normal.  Her men of\r\nfinance gave counsel; they offered credit and we applauded.  We\r\nwere touched by the works of associations and individuals to\r\nlessen war's terrors and to refound the wrecked civilization.\r\nBut foolish men, vain men, envious men forbade our government to\r\ndo in larger form the same sort of acts which, done by private\r\nauspices, we applauded as evidence of Christian purpose.\r\n\r\n\"And the good that we sought to do was lost in our larger\r\nneglect.  Weak fears that in helping the world, fantastic\r\nforebodings that in taking our stand for peace everlasting,\r\nimaginary perils that in service we might be surrendering our\r\nbirthright of independence restrained our more noble impulses.\r\nWhile famine stalked and the world cried to heaven for our help\r\nwe debated selfish questions.  Our nation became a silent but\r\neffective partner in undermining Christian civilization, causing\r\nthe despairing peoples of Europe, friend and enemy alike, to\r\nturn in every agony to those who denied the fundamental precepts\r\nupon which our society rests.\r\n\r\n\"Some one has called this black despair, 'Satanism,' the belief\r\nthat the laws and deeds of God and men are set against the\r\nvictim.  And we, through the perversity of a few men, have been\r\nsilent enemies of Christian faith and allies, indeed, or this\r\nnewer scourge of mankind.  There are happiness and satisfaction\r\nin the thought that we have not this fault to bear.  It is not\r\nstrange to us that those who permitted narrow views and\r\nungenerous purpose to thwart our nation in its duty rest\r\nuncomfortably under the accusations of the American conscience.\r\nIf temporary success is to be won at such sacrifice we cannot\r\nthink it worth the price.\r\n\r\n\"Nor can the blame be shifted.  So far as was humanly possible,\r\nobjections were met.  Reservations stating our complete\r\ncompliance with the fundamental organic law, needless as they\r\nwere in a strictly legal sense, were proposed.  Others were\r\naccepted where they seemed to be animated by proper motives, but\r\ngood faith prevented acceptance of those which proposed to\r\nwithdraw the pledge in the same document in which it was\r\nplighted.  As was observed in the address accepting the\r\ndesignation as champion of the party, every boy in our schools\r\nknows that war may be declared only by act of Congress and that\r\nthe American Constitution rises superior to all treaties.  Still,\r\nevery friend of the Covenant was ready to acquiesce in proposals\r\nthat would state these propositions, and more, if that would\r\nprove a solution.\r\n\r\n\"Failing in this effort, the resolution was formed that the only\r\nother method lay in submitting the matter in a solemn referendum\r\nto the conscience of America.  In that great judgment we now are.\r\nMen are but instrumentalities of the Divine Will, worked out, we\r\npray, in the nations.  Few things are of smaller importance than\r\nthe temporal fortunes of men; no things of greater importance\r\nthan the destiny of mankind.  Willingly would we undergo crushing\r\ndefeat to save the principle for which we strive, guiltily would\r\nwe assume power won by appeal to baser motives and selfish\r\nfears.\r\n\r\n\"There is in this year, for the causes here outlined, a\r\nmilitancy as of the Crusaders, marching over mountains and\r\ndeserts to wrest the Holy Places from unworthy hands.  There is a\r\nsacred fire in the countenances of those who speak the message,\r\nthere is a joy in proclaiming the tidings, there is a zeal in\r\nspreading the word.  We are preachers this year of national\r\nrighteousness, of honor, of faith and of high purpose.\r\n\r\n\"We scorn to think of our mission in ordinary terms.  We disdain\r\nto look upon the early days of November as a test of rival\r\norganizations in their power to muster votes.  We have no mind to\r\ncompete in lavish outlay, we have no purpose to resort to\r\nsinister methods of electrical appeal.  If we are to be chosen,\r\nit is to be because we have won the conscience of the nation,\r\nand God helping us, we will appeal to nothing else.\r\n\r\n\"We turn from the external duties of the country to its\r\ninternal.  Promises with respect to these matters must of every\r\nnecessity be in general terms largely because the problems are\r\nvast and must adjust themselves to all parts of the country,\r\nharmonizing with conditions that vary widely.  Back of all\r\nlegislation, back of statute and executive policy worth while,\r\nthere lies one unvarying hope and purpose--to right wrong, to\r\nsecure justice and to give equal opportunity.  All measures must\r\nbe tested by these great principles and on them rest securely if\r\nat all.\r\n\r\n\"Past performances--the record--furnish the best indication of a\r\nman's mind, and the executive acts and legislative\r\nrecommendations of the Governor of Ohio during the past six\r\nyears have been studied with great care.  That they have won\r\napproval is a source of gratification and satisfaction that will\r\nendure.  We are in this country face to face with gigantic\r\nproblems.  They cannot be left unsolved.  That would be blindness.\r\nThey cannot be considered in the gathering darkness of reaction,\r\nthey must be viewed in the brightening dawn of a new day.\r\n\r\n\"Before us we have the examples of restrained liberties and of\r\nunfulfilled desires.  It is dangerous to trust reactionary forces\r\nwith power.  It may become a little short of menacing to the\r\nstability of our institutions and to the orderly processes of\r\ndevelopment.  It is well to sound a word of warning, calmly but\r\never seriously.\r\n\r\n\"As has been observed, actions furnish the basis of\r\ndetermination of fitness for further service.  What better\r\nguarantee of cordial and sound industrial relations between\r\nemployee and employer than legislation which follows the lines\r\nof the Ohio workmen's compensation law?  Under its influence,\r\nindustrial conditions have improved, life and limb have been\r\nconserved, the workmen's families are happy in their security\r\nand a new era has dawned for millions of people.  It was enacted\r\nwhen legislation of this sort was an experiment in America.  If\r\nevery state in this Union had a law of this sort our nation\r\nwould have solved half of its industrial problems.  Our courts\r\nare free from the vexatious litigation that fosters criticism\r\nand they are trusted as never before in history.  It has been a\r\nfactor of no small importance that enabled our state to uphold\r\nthe sovereignty of the law without repressive measures directed\r\nagainst freedom of speech and pen.\r\n\r\n\"Educational activities have been quickened and rural life has\r\nbeen regenerated through modem school legislation.  To the boys\r\nand girls of our rural districts there are coming schools which\r\nwill be second to none in our most progressive cities, and one\r\nof the reasons for draining of the country districts of\r\npopulation will be checked.  It has given an impetus to church\r\nand community life that is of greatest importance.\r\n\r\n\"These things are cited not because there is any disposition to\r\nurge that there should be encroachment by the federal government\r\non local control.  It is the healthful, reasonable individualism\r\nof American national life that has enabled the people of this\r\ncountry to think for themselves.  We have no will to impair their\r\nindependence.  The central government can assist and give\r\nencouragement to state movements if the men called to high\r\npositions are in sympathy with progress.  A reactionary central\r\ngovernment can demonstrate likewise that it has no sympathy with\r\nmen of vision who ever have difficult tasks in bringing about\r\nthe taking of forward steps.\r\n\r\n\"The details of these instances, which might be greatly\r\nexpanded, have been touched in order to form a setting as for a\r\npicture.  Our view is toward to-morrow.  The opposition, and I\r\nassume that they are sincere in it, stands in the skyline of the\r\nsetting sun, looking backward, backward to the old days of\r\nreaction.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nCOX AND THE LEAGUE--\"I FAVOR GOING IN\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"And I do earnestly urge that all the people of this great and\r\nenlightened state assemble at their respective places of worship\r\nand invoke Almighty God to enlighten the Rulers of the world to\r\nthe end that they may see the folly of war and speedily\r\nterminate it; that in our homes and about our hearthstones we\r\nimplore the Divine Spirit in behalf of the people of the\r\nstricken nations, whose miseries are beyond our comprehension--\r\npeople who have been plunged into the depths of war through no\r\nfault of their own.\r\n\r\n\"And I do further recommend and urge that in all the schools of\r\nthe State of Ohio the afternoon of Friday, October 2nd, 1914, be\r\nset aside for exercises, having for their purpose to instill\r\ninto the minds of children and into their hearts the great\r\nblessing that will come to them and to the world when war is no\r\nmore.\"\r\n\r\nThe quoted sentences from Governor Cox's proclamation for a day\r\nof prayer on October 4, 1914, a period at which the horrors of\r\nthe great world war had but begun, disclose that Governor Cox is\r\nnot a recent convert to the central thought and purpose of the\r\nconception of the League of Nations.\r\n\r\nThrough the numerous official proclamations and the many\r\naddresses which he made during the period of the war the central\r\nthought repeatedly emphasized was that the fruit of war must be\r\nan everlasting peace.  In accordance with the proclamation of the\r\nPresident, establishing June 5, 1917, as the \"call-to-the-\r\ncolors\" day of the young men of the Country, the Governor said:\r\n\r\n\"It is probably the most trying hour the world has ever known,\r\nand the policies of government, purified and preserved by those\r\nwho live now, will determine the civilization under which our\r\nchildren and our children's children shall live in the future.\r\nWhat greater guarantee of their peace and happiness can be given\r\nthem than a democracy that envelops all nations--a democracy\r\nsanctified by an endearing memory of what was unselfishly given\r\nto make it possible?\"\r\n\r\nIn his proclamation calling for a State convention to perfect\r\nthe organization of an Ohio branch of the League to Enforce\r\nPeace, the Governor emphasized as the second of its objects \"to\r\nkeep the world safe by a League of Nations,\" and he said that\r\nthe purpose of the organization would be \"to confirm opposition\r\nto a premature peace and sustain the determination of our people\r\nto fight until Prussian militarism is destroyed and the way may\r\nbe open for securing permanent peace by a League of Nations.\"\r\nWhen hostilities were concluded Governor Cox had the faith that\r\n\"this peace brings the dawn of a new day of consecration,\" and\r\nin his official proclamation he said:  \"A world is reborn.  Our\r\nNation has brought success to a righteous cause.  Our State has\r\ngiven with full heart to the achievement of the glorious end.\"\r\n\r\nIn an address in Toronto, Canada, November, 1918, Governor Cox\r\nsaid:  \"We consign to posterity an example and inspiration and\r\nidealism as lofty as ever stirred the hearts of men.  And then,\r\nturning away from the past, we face the sunrise of to-morrow\r\nwith faith and resolution to make a better world than that of\r\nyesterday, and to demonstrate that our heroic defenders have not\r\ndied in vain.  These are dangerous times to permit the inventive\r\ngenius of man to go unchecked in matters of armament.  The\r\nunspeakable horrors of the war just ended make us instinctively\r\nturn our faces away from the possibility of a half-century from\r\nnow, if our thought is to be turned intensively to the\r\nproduction of things destructive to home life.  With the sea\r\nfairly alive with submarines, the air filled with squadrons of\r\nflying machines, and the mysteries of nature unfolding before\r\nthe sustained labor of chemists--cities and states and nations\r\ncould be quickly depopulated.  The Prussian conspiracy would not\r\nhave been possible if the international affairs of the earth had\r\nbeen assigned to a League of Nations.  The play may seem to be\r\naltruistic, if not fantastic, but the skeptic is moved by the\r\nidea that nations cannot forget selfishness.  If that be true,\r\nthen the world lacks the fundamental fibers of character to\r\nbuild an enduring civilization.\"\r\n\r\nIn welcoming the returned soldiers of the 166th Infantry in New\r\nYork in may, 1919, Governor Cox said:  \"If peace is to endure, it\r\nmust be by means of institutions of government whose strength in\r\nthe right must inspire public confidence.  We solemnly give the\r\npledge of our state that the faith will be kept.\"\r\n\r\nEconomic effects of the defeat of the Treaty of Peace were\r\ndiscussed by Governor Cox at Henderson, Kentucky, in April,\r\n1920.  He said:  \"Some of you may not know the effect of the\r\ndefeat of the Treaty.  While at Mayfield (Ky.) I saw an old\r\nfarmer who told me he was offered twenty and ten dollars for his\r\ntobacco before Christmas, but was forced to sell at six and\r\nthree dollars.  The tumbling of the foreign exchange and the\r\ninability of Italy and other Continental European countries to\r\npurchase their tobacco is the cause of Western Kentucky farmers\r\nlosing millions of dollars.  This resulted from the Republican\r\nSenate's refusal to ratify the peace treaty.  While the\r\nRepublican dictators of the Senate set the stage for political\r\ntriumph, they do not care how much tobacco growers or the people\r\nat large suffer.\r\n\r\nTurning to the patriotic issue of the present campaign, he said\r\nat the same time:  \"It will be with infinite pleasure that we\r\nshall ask the Republican spellbinders if they have kept the\r\nfaith with the boys who sleep overseas.\"\r\n\r\nDuring all the progress of the early part of the campaign the\r\nGovernor denounced those who \"are seeking to set up racial lines\r\nand create a prejudice among the foreign elements in our midst.\"\r\nHe said:  \"While other powers are doing everything possible to\r\nhold the loose ends of civilization together, these leaders are\r\ndeliberately conspiring to mislead the great bulk of Americans\r\nwith assertions that are, when analyzed, nothing more than\r\ndemagoguery of the crudest kind.\"  Earlier in the year, in\r\nspeaking before the Jefferson Club of Marion, Indiana, the\r\nGovernor said:  \"The plot to multiply the woes of mankind, in\r\norder that confusion multiplied might be charged to President\r\nWilson's insistence on principle and international good faith,\r\nis now passing through the process of public thought, and we\r\nhave confidence in an intelligent verdict.  The winning of the\r\nwar, in less time than the formalizing of peace carries a\r\ncontrast that needs no comment.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the period for the selection of delegates to the\r\nDemocratic Convention at San Francisco, Governor Cox gave a\r\nsigned interview to the New York Times, in which he reviewed the\r\ncontroversy concerning the League of Nations and outlined two\r\nreservations which he believed would satisfy every reasonable\r\nobjection.  In part, he said:\r\n\r\n\"If public opinion in the country is the same as it is in Ohio,\r\nthen there can be no doubt but that the people want a League of\r\nNations because it seems to offer the surest guarantee against\r\nwar.  I am convinced that the San Francisco Convention will\r\nendorse in its vital principles the League adopted at\r\nVersailles.\r\n\r\n\"There can be no doubt but that some senators have been\r\nconscientious in their desire to clarify the provisions of the\r\ntreaty.  Two things apparently have disturbed them.  First, they\r\nwanted to make sure that the League was not to be an alliance,\r\nand that its basic purpose was peace and not controversy.\r\nSecond, they wanted the other powers signing the instrument to\r\nunderstand our constitutional limitations beyond which the\r\ntreaty-making power cannot go.\r\n\r\n\"Dealing with these two questions in order, it has always seemed\r\nto me that the interpretation of the function of the League\r\nmight have been stated in these words:\r\n\r\n\"'In giving its assent to this treaty, the Senate has in mind\r\nthe fact that the League of Nations which it embodies was\r\ndevised for the sole purpose of maintaining peace and comity\r\namong the nations of the earth and preventing the recurrence of\r\nsuch destructive conflicts as that through which the world has\r\njust passed.  The co-operation of the United States with the\r\nLeague and its continuance as a member thereof, will naturally\r\ndepend upon the adherence of the League to that fundamental\r\npurpose.'\r\n\r\n\"Such a declaration would at least express the view of the\r\nUnited States and justify the course which our nation would\r\nunquestionably follow if the basic purpose of the League were at\r\nany time distorted.  It would also appear to be a simple matter\r\nto provide against any misunderstanding in the future and at the\r\nsame time to meet the objections of those who believe that we\r\nmight be inviting a controversy over our constitutional rights,\r\nby making a senatorial addition on words something like these:\r\n\r\n\"'It will of course be understood that in carrying out the\r\npurpose of the League, the government of the United States must\r\nat all times act in strict harmony with the terms and intent of\r\nthe United States Constitution, which cannot in any way be\r\naltered by the treaty-making power.'\r\n\r\n\"Some people doubt the enduring quality of this general\r\ninternational scheme.  Whether this be true or not, the fact\r\nremains that it will justify itself if it does no more than\r\nprevent the nations of the earth from arming themselves to the\r\nteeth and wasting resource which is necessary to repair the\r\nlosses of the war.  No one contends that it is a perfect\r\ndocument, but it is a step in the right direction.  It would put\r\nthe loose ends of civilization together now and do more toward\r\nthe restoration of normal conditions in six months' time than\r\ncan the powers of the earth, acting independently, in ten years'\r\ntime.  The Republican senatorial cabal insists that the treaty be\r\nAmericanized.  Suppose that Italy asked that it be Italianized--\r\nFrance that it be Frenchized--Britain that it be Britainized,\r\nand so on down the line.  The whole thing would result in a\r\nperfect travesty.\r\n\r\n\"The important thing now is to enable the world to go to work,\r\nbut the beginning must not be on the soft sands of an unsound\r\nplan.  If this question passes to the next administration, there\r\nshould be no fetich developed over past differences.  Yet at the\r\nsame time there must be no surrender of vital principles.  It may\r\nbe necessary if partitions and reparation require changing, to\r\nassemble representatives of the people making up the nations of\r\nthe League, in which event revision may not be so much an affair\r\nof diplomats.  But I repeat the pressing task is getting started,\r\nbeing careful however that we are starting with an instrument\r\nworth while, and not a mere shadow.\"\r\n\r\nTo an extent to which very few public men favoring the League of\r\nNations have gone, Governor Cox has expressed the firm\r\nconviction that the League will enable the people of Ireland to\r\nbring their contention and claims before a world tribunal.  It\r\nwas his statement before an audience in Cincinnati that the\r\nLeague would be the means by which the Irish case could be heard\r\nin the highest court in the world, and he stated that thus far\r\nit had never been heard even in a magistrate's court.  Sentiments\r\non the question of self-determination were also expressed in his\r\narticle in the New York Times.  In this the Governor said:\r\n\r\n\"We are a composite people in the United States and the belief\r\nof students of government in years past that our democracy would\r\nnot endure was based entirely upon the idea that we could not\r\nbuild a nation from the blood of many races which had old\r\ninherited prejudices.  It is very important, particularly at this\r\ntime when racial impulses and emotions have been stirred world-\r\nwide as never before, that we make the utmost effort to prevent\r\ndivision along these lines.  In this connection it is well to\r\nbear in mind that the armistice which preceded the peace was\r\nbased upon fourteen cardinal points; one of the most, if not the\r\nmost, important of which was the right of self-determination.\r\n\r\n\"Wars in the past have resulted largely from dispute over\r\nterritory and imposed restraints of racial aspirations.\r\nGovernmental entities are more apt to last and to live\r\nharmoniously with others if groups are bounded by racial\r\nhomogeneity rather than by the physical characteristics of the\r\nearth in the form of mountains, rivers, etc.  Individual\r\naspiration is a God-given element and distinct ambitions possess\r\nthe soul of racial unity.  In harmony with this theory, the San\r\nFrancisco convention should emphasize the Democratic belief in\r\nthe principle of self-determination in government.  Our citizens\r\nwill not deny to any race of people the right to hold the\r\nemotions which stirred the founders of our Republic.\"\r\n\r\nThe Governor's position on the League was amplified in his\r\nAddress of Acceptance at Dayton on August 7th, 1920, in which he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"We are in a time which calls for straight thinking, straight\r\ntalking and straight acting.  This is no time for wobbling.  Never\r\nin all our history has more been done for government.  Never was\r\nsacrifice more sublime.  The most precious things of heart and\r\nhome were given up in a spirit which guarantees the perpetuity\r\nof our institutions--if the faith is kept with those who served\r\nand suffered.  The altar of our republic is drenched in blood and\r\ntears, and he who turns away from the tragedies and obligations\r\nof the war, not consecrated to a sense of honor and of duty\r\nwhich resists every base suggestion of personal or political\r\nexpediency, is unworthy of the esteem of his countrymen.\r\n\r\n\"The men and women who by expressed policy at the San Francisco\r\nConvention charted our course in the open seas of the future\r\nsensed the spirit of the hour and phrased it with clarity and\r\ncourage.  It is not necessary to read and reread the Democratic\r\nplatform to know its meaning.  It is a document clear in its\r\nanalysis of conditions and plain in the pledge of service made\r\nto the public.  It carries honesty of word and intent.  Proud of\r\nthe leadership and achievement of the party in war, Democracy\r\nfaces unafraid the problems of peace.  Indeed, its pronouncement\r\nhas but to be read along with the platform framed by Republican\r\nleaders in order that both spirit and purpose as they dominate\r\nthe opposing organizations may be contrasted.  On the one hand we\r\nsee pride expressed in the nation's glory and a promise of\r\nservice easily understood.  On the other a captious, unhappy\r\nspirit and the treatment of subjects vital to the present and\r\nthe future, in terms that have completely confused the public\r\nmind.  It was clear that the senatorial oligarchy had been given\r\nits own way in the selection of the presidential candidate, but\r\nit was surprising that it was able to fasten into the party\r\nplatform the creed of hate and bitterness and the vacillating\r\npolicy that possesses it.\r\n\r\n\"In the midst of war the present senatorial cabal, led by\r\nSenators Lodge, Penrose and Smoot, was formed.  Superficial\r\nevidence of loyalty to the President was deliberate in order\r\nthat the great rank and file of their party, faithful and\r\npatriotic to the very core, might not be offended.  But\r\nunderneath this misleading exterior, conspirators planned and\r\nplotted, with bigoted zeal.  With victory to our arms they\r\ndelayed and obstructed the works of peace.  If deemed useful to\r\nthe work in hand no artifice for interfering with our\r\nconstitutional peace-making authority was rejected.  Before the\r\ncountry knew, yes, before these men themselves knew the details\r\nof the composite plan, formed at the peace table, they declared\r\ntheir opposition to it.  Before the treaty was submitted to the\r\nsenate in the manner the Constitution provides, they violated\r\nevery custom and every consideration of decency by presenting a\r\ncopy of the document, procured unblushingly from enemy hands,\r\nand passed it into the printed record of senatorial proceedings.\r\nFrom that hour dated the enterprise of throwing the whole\r\nsubject into a technical discussion, in order that the public\r\nmight be confused.  The plan has never changed in its objective,\r\nbut the method has.  At the outset there was the careful\r\ninsistence that there was no desire to interfere with the\r\nprinciple evolved and formalized at Versailles.  Later, it was\r\nthe form and not the substance that professedly inspired attack.\r\nBut pretense was futile when proposals later came forth that\r\nclearly emasculated the basic principle of the whole peace plan.\r\nIt is not necessary to recall the details of the controversy in\r\nthe senate.  Senator Lodge finally crystallized his ideas into\r\nwhat were known as the Lodge reservations, and when congress\r\nadjourned these reservations held the support of the so-called\r\nregular Republican leaders.\r\n\r\n\"From that time the processes have been interesting.  Political\r\nexpediency in its truest sense dwarfed every consideration\r\neither of the public interest or of the maintenance of the honor\r\nof a great political party.  The exclusive question was how to\r\navoid a rupture in the Republican organization.  The country\r\nreceived with interest, to say the least, the announcement from\r\nChicago, where the national convention was assembled, that a\r\nplatform plank dealing with the subject of world peace, had been\r\ndrawn leaving out the Lodge reservations, and yet remaining\r\nagreeable to all interests, meaning thereby, the Lodge\r\nreservationists, the mild reservationists and the group of\r\nRepublican senators that openly opposed the League of Nations in\r\nany form.\r\n\r\n\"As the platform made no definite committal of policy and was,\r\nin fact, so artfully phrased as to make almost any deduction\r\npossible, it passed through the convention with practical\r\nunanimity.  Senator Johnson, however, whose position has been\r\nconsistent and whose opposition to the League in any shape is\r\nwell known, withheld his support of the convention's choice\r\nuntil the candidate had stated the meaning of the platform, and\r\nannounced definitely the policy that would be his, if elected.\r\n\r\n\"The Republican candidate has spoken and his utterance calls\r\nforth the following approval from Senator Johnson:\r\n\r\n\"'Yesterday in his speech of acceptance Senator Harding\r\nunequivocally took his stand upon the paramount issue in this\r\ncampaign--the League of Nations.  The Republican party stands\r\ncommitted by its platform.  Its standard-bearer has now\r\naccentuated that platform.  There can be no misunderstanding his\r\nwords.'\r\n\r\n\"Senator Harding, as the candidate of the party, and Senator\r\nJohnson are as one on this question, and, as the latter\r\nexpresses it, the Republican party is committed both by platform\r\nin the abstract and by its candidate in specification.  The\r\nthreatened revolt among leaders of the party is averted, but the\r\nminority position as expressed in the senate prevails as that of\r\nthe party.  In short, principle, as avowed in support of the\r\nLodge reservations, or of the so-called mild reservations, has\r\nbeen surrendered to expediency.\r\n\r\n\"Senator Harding makes this new pledge of policy in behalf of\r\nhis party:\r\n\r\n\"'I promise you formal and effective peace so quickly as a\r\nRepublican congress can pass its declaration for a Republican\r\nexecutive to sign.'\r\n\r\n\"This means but one thing--a separate peace with Germany!\r\n\r\n\"This would be the most disheartening event in civilization\r\nsince the Russians made their separate peace with Germany, and\r\ninfinitely more unworthy on our part than it was on that of the\r\nRussians.  They were threatened with starvation and revolution\r\nhad swept their country.  Our soldiers fought side by side with\r\nthe Allies.  So complete was the coalition of strength and\r\npurpose that General Fochs was given supreme command, and every\r\nsoldier in the allied cause, no matter what flag he followed,\r\nrecognized him as his chief.  We fought the war together, and now\r\nbefore the thing is through it is proposed to enter into a\r\nseparate peace with Germany!  In good faith we pledged our\r\nstrength with our associates for the enforcement of terms upon\r\noffending powers, and now it is suggested that this be\r\nwithdrawn.  Suppose Germany, recognizing the first break in the\r\nAllies, proposes something we cannot accept.  Does Senator\r\nHarding intend to send an army to Germany to press her to our\r\nterms?  Certainly the allied army could not be expected to render\r\naid.  If, on the other hand, Germany should accept the chance we\r\noffered of breaking the bond it would be for the express purpose\r\nof insuring a German-American alliance, recognizing that the\r\nAllies--in fact, no nation in good standing--would have anything\r\nto do with either of us.\r\n\r\n\"This plan would not only be a piece of bungling diplomacy, but\r\nplain, unadulterated dishonesty, as well.\"\r\n\r\n\"No less an authority than Senator Lodge said, before the heat\r\nof recent controversy, that to make peace except in company with\r\nthe Allies would 'brand us everlastingly with dishonor and bring\r\nruin to us.'\r\n\r\n\"And then after peace is made with Germany, Senator Harding\r\nwould, he says, 'hopefully approach the nations of Europe and of\r\nthe earth, proposing that understanding which makes us a willing\r\nparticipant in the consecration of nations to a new\r\nrelationship.'\r\n\r\n\"In short, America, refusing to enter the League of Nations (now\r\nalready established by twenty-nine nations) and bearing and\r\ndeserving the contempt of the world, would submit an entirely\r\nnew project.  This act would either be regarded as arrant madness\r\nor attempted international bossism.\r\n\r\n\"The plain truth is, that the Republican leaders, obsessed with\r\na determination to win the presidential election, have attempted\r\nto satisfy too many divergent views.  Inconsistencies, inevitable\r\nunder the circumstances, rise to haunt them on every hand, and\r\nthey find themselves arrayed, in public thought at least,\r\nagainst a great principle.  More than that, their conduct is\r\nopposed to the idealism upon which their party prospered in\r\nother days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Illustrating these observations by concrete facts, let it be\r\nremembered that those now inveighing against an interest in\r\naffairs outside of America, criticised President Wilson in\r\nunmeasured terms for not resenting the invasion of Belgium in\r\n1914.  They term the League of Nations a military alliance,\r\nwhich, except for their opposition, would envelop our country,\r\nwhen, as a matter of truth, the subject of a League of Nations\r\nhas claimed the best thought of America for years, and the\r\nLeague to Enforce Peace was presided over by so distinguished a\r\nRepublican as ex-President Taft, who, before audiences in every\r\nsection, advocated the principle and the plan of the present\r\nLeague.  They charge experimentation, when we have as historical\r\nprecedent the Monroe Doctrine, which is the very essence of\r\nArticle X of the Versailles covenant.  Skeptics viewed Monroe's\r\nmandate with alarm, predicting recurrent wars in defense of\r\nCentral and South American states, whose guardians they alleged\r\nwe need not be.  And yet not a shot has been fired in almost one\r\nhundred years in preserving sovereign rights on this hemisphere.\r\nThey hypocritically claim that the League of Nations will result\r\nin our boys being drawn into military service, but they fail to\r\nrealize that every high-school youngster in the land knows that\r\nno treaty can override our Constitution, which reserves to\r\nCongress, and to Congress alone, the power to declare war.  They\r\npreach Americanism with a meaning of their own invention, and\r\nartfully appeal to a selfish and provincial spirit, forgetting\r\nthat Lincoln fought a war over the purely moral question of\r\nslavery, and the McKinley broke the fetters of our boundary\r\nlines, spoke the freedom of Cuba, and carried the torch of\r\nAmerican idealism to the benighted Philippines.  They lose memory\r\nof Garfield's prophecy that America, under the blessings of God-\r\ngiven opportunity, would by her moral leadership and co-\r\noperation become the Messiah among the nations of the earth.\r\n\r\n\"These are fateful times.  Organized government has a definite\r\nduty all over the world.  The house of civilization is to be put\r\nin order.  The supreme issue of the century is before us and the\r\nnation that halts and delays is playing with fire.  The finest\r\nimpulses of humanity, rising above national lines, merely seek\r\nto make another horrible war impossible.  Under the old order of\r\ninternational anarchy war came overnight, and the world was on\r\nfire before we knew it.  It sickens our senses to think of\r\nanother.  We saw one conflict into which modern science brought\r\nnew forms of destruction in great guns, submarines, airships,\r\nand poison gases.  It is no secret that our chemists had\r\nperfected, when the contest came to a precipitate close, gases\r\nso deadly that whole cities could be wiped out, armies\r\ndestroyed, and the crews of battleships smothered.  The public\r\nprints are filled with the opinions of military men that in\r\nfuture wars the method, more effective than gases or bombs, will\r\nbe the employment of the germs of disease, carrying pestilence\r\nand destruction.  Any nation prepared under these conditions, as\r\nGermany was equipped in 1914, could conquer the world in a year.\r\n\r\n\"It is planned now to make this impossible.  A definite plan has\r\nbeen agreed upon.  The League of Nations is in operation.  A very\r\nimportant work, under its control, just completed, was\r\nparticipated in by the Hon. Elihu Root, Secretary of State under\r\nthe Roosevelt administration.  At a meeting of the Council of the\r\nLeague of Nations, February 11, and organizing committee of\r\ntwelve of the most eminent jurists in the world was selected.\r\nThe duty of this group was to devise a plan for the\r\nestablishment of a Permanent Court of International Justice, as\r\na branch of the League.  This assignment has been concluded by\r\nunanimous action.  This augurs well for world progress.  The\r\nquestion is whether we shall or shall not join in this practical\r\nand humane movement.  President Wilson, as our representative at\r\nthe peace table, entered the League in our name, in so far as\r\nthe executive authority permitted.  Senator Harding, as the\r\nRepublican candidate for the presidency, proposes in plain words\r\nthat we remain out of it.  As the Democratic candidate, I favor\r\ngoing in.  Let us analyze Senator Harding's plan of making a\r\nGerman-American peace, and then calling for a 'new relationship\r\namong nations,' assuming for the purpose of argument only, that\r\nthe perfidious hand that dealt with Germany would possess the\r\npower or influence to draw twenty-nine nations away from a plan\r\nalready at work, and induce them to retrace every step and make\r\na new beginning.  This would entail our appointing another\r\ncommission to assemble with those selected by the other powers.\r\nWith the Versailles instrument discarded, the whole subject of\r\npartitions and divisions of territory on new lines would be\r\nreopened.  The difficulties in this regard, as any fair mind\r\nappreciates, would be greater than they were at the peace\r\nsession, and we must not attempt to convince ourselves that they\r\ndid not try the genius, patience, and diplomacy of statesmen at\r\nthat time.  History will say that great as was the Allied triumph\r\nin war, no less a victory was achieved at the peace table.  The\r\nRepublican proposal means dishonor, world confusion and delay.\r\nIt would keep us in permanent company with Germany, Russia,\r\nTurkey and Mexico.  It would entail, in the ultimate, more real\r\ninjury than the war itself.  The Democratic position on the\r\nquestion, as expressed in platform is:\r\n\r\n\"'We advocate immediate ratification of the Treaty without\r\nreservations which would impair its essential integrity, but do\r\nno oppose the acceptance of any reservation making clearer or\r\nmore specific the obligations of the United States to the League\r\nassociates.'\r\n\r\n\"The first duty of the new administration clearly will be the\r\nratification of the Treaty.  The matter should be approached\r\nwithout thought of the bitterness of the past.  The public\r\nverdict will have been rendered, and I am confident that the\r\nfriends of world peace as it will be promoted by the League,\r\nwill have in numbers the constitutional requisite to favorable\r\nsenatorial action.  The captious may say that our platform\r\nreference to reservations is vague and indefinite.  Its meaning,\r\nin brief, is that we shall state our interpretation of the\r\ncovenant as a matter of good faith to our associates and as a\r\nprecaution against any misunderstanding in the future.  The point\r\nis, that after the people shall have spoken, the League will be\r\nin the hands of its friends in the Senate, and a safe index as\r\nto what they will do is supplied by what reservations they have\r\nproposed in the past.\r\n\r\n\"Our platform clearly lays no bar against any additions that\r\nwill be helpful, but it speaks in a firm resolution to stand\r\nagainst anything that disturbs the vital principle.  We hear it\r\nsaid that interpretations are unnecessary.  That may be true, but\r\nthey will at least be reassuring to many of our citizens, who\r\nfeel that in signing the treaty, there should be no mental\r\nreservations that are not expressed in plain words, as a matter\r\nof good faith to our associates.  Such interpretations possess\r\nthe further virtue of supplying a base upon which agreement can\r\nbe reached, and agreement, without injury to the covenant, is\r\nnow of pressing importance.  It was the desire to get things\r\nstarted, that prompted some members of the senate to vote for\r\nthe Lodge reservations.  Those who conscientiously voted for them\r\nin the final roll calls realized, however, that they acted under\r\nduress, in that a politically bigoted minority was exercising\r\nthe arbitrary power of its position to enforce drastic\r\nconditions.  Happily the voters of the republic, under our system\r\nof government, can remedy that situation, and I have the faith\r\nthat they will, at the election this fall.  Then organized\r\ngovernment will be enabled to combine impulse and facility in\r\nthe making of better world conditions.  The agencies of exchange\r\nwill automatically adjust themselves to the opportunities of\r\ncommercial freedom.  New life and renewed hope will take hold of\r\nevery nation.  Mankind will press a resolute shoulder to the task\r\nof readjustment, and a new era will have dawned upon the earth.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking to the National Guardsmen at the National Rifle Matches\r\nat Camp Perry, Ohio, on August 12, he said:\r\n\r\n\"I recognize that in a sense you are assembled here for the\r\npurpose of increasing the efficiency of our military strength,\r\nand yet I am convinced that the great mass of our soldiers are\r\nunited in purpose and prayer, to prevent wars in the future, if\r\nit can be honorably done.  They know the meaning of modern\r\nwarfare.  There was very little romance in the long hours and the\r\nslaughter of the front trench.  The thought that must have run\r\nthrough the mind of every solder in the midst of it all, was how\r\nsuch a thing was possible in modern civilization.\r\n\r\n\"The cost to the United States was more than one million dollars\r\nan hour for over two years.  The total expense of twenty-two\r\nbillion dollars was almost equal to the total disbursements of\r\nthe United States government from 1791 to 1918.  It was\r\nsufficient to have run the Revolutionary War for more than one\r\nthousand years at the rate of expenditure which that war\r\ninvolved.  The army expenditures alone, so experts claim, are a\r\nnear approach to the volume of gold produced in the United Sates\r\nfrom the discovery of America up to the outbreak of the European\r\nWar, and yet the United States spent only about one-eighth of the\r\nentire cost of the war, and less than one-fifth of the\r\nexpenditure of the allied side.\r\n\r\n\"If civilization has not had its lesson, then there is no hope\r\nfor it.  It could not stand such a war again and survive.  The\r\ngenius of man, if that is a happy term in discussing the horrors\r\nof conflict, has always made the latest war the most frightful.\r\nWhen we consider the development in the methods of human\r\ndestruction between 1914 and 1918 and apply the problem of\r\nsimple proportion, we are staggered even to think of the\r\npossibilities of the sons of men being again brought into\r\ncombat.\r\n\r\n\"There will always be a national guard in the States, if for no\r\nother reason than domestic defense, and the military arm of the\r\nfederal government will be maintained, but the hope that vast\r\nexpenditures for armaments are a thing of the past, possesses\r\nevery home in America, while the common impulse that moves the\r\ngreat mass of people world-wide is inspired by the vision of\r\npeace and the settlement of controversy by the arbitrament of\r\nreason rather than of force.\"\r\n\r\nAt the very beginning of his canvass for the Presidency Governor\r\nCox has gone upon the theory that the League of Nations needed\r\nsimple explanation to the people of the Country.  In his own\r\nphrase, he has talked the ABC's of the League, finding that the\r\ntechnical discussions had failed to hold the interest of the\r\npeople.  Illustrating this policy are two addresses made to state\r\nconventions early in August.  At Wheeling, to the West Virginia\r\nDemocratic Convention, he said:\r\n\r\n\"We resisted a world-wide menace, and we intend now to establish\r\npermanent protection against another menace.  We know how easily\r\nwars came in the past.  We want to make their coming difficult in\r\nthe future.  We have a definite plan; the American people\r\nunderstand it, and after the 4th of March, 1921, it is our\r\npurpose to put it into practical operation, without continuing\r\nmonths of useless discussion.\r\n\r\n\"The platform of our party gives us the opportunity to render\r\nmoral co-operation in the greatest movement of righteousness in\r\nthe history of the world, and at the same time to hold our own\r\ninterests free from peril.  Our position is plain.  The\r\ncircumstances of the last eighteen months convict the Republican\r\nleadership of attempted trickery with the American people.  Under\r\none pretext after another they prevented the readjustment of\r\nnational conditions.  They proposed certain reservations to the\r\nLeague of Nations, and then they were abandoned, to be followed\r\nby nothing more definite than the announcement of a 'hope' that\r\nan entirely new arrangement might be made in world affairs.  What\r\nmethod they have in mind, if it is concretely in anyone's mind,\r\nthe people do not know.  No unprejudiced person can deny that the\r\nconsequence of abandoning the League and attempting an entirely\r\nnew project, will be prolonged delay.  If the voters of the\r\nRepublic, without regard to party, desire action, and prompt\r\naction along lines that are now clearly understood, they will\r\nrender a verdict so overwhelmingly expressive of public\r\nindignation that scheming politicians for years to come will not\r\nforget.\r\n\r\n\"In the fact of an efficient leadership during the war, and of\r\nconstructive, progressive, economic service in peace, the\r\nRepublican leaders developed a smoke screen, behind which they\r\nseek to gain their objective, the spoils of office.  For years\r\nthe best thought and the humanitarian impulses of civilized\r\ncountries have been applied to the high purpose of making war\r\npractically impossible.  The League of Nations became the\r\ncomposite agreement, and now the senatorial oligarchy meets it\r\nwith the absurd plea that it increases the probability of armed\r\nconflict.  It not only reveals unworthy intent, but a very poor\r\nestimate of American intelligence as well.\"\r\n\r\nTaking the issue to the people, and free from what he termed\r\nstrait-jacket restrictions, the Governor said at Columbus, when\r\nhe talked to the Ohio Democratic Convention:\r\n\r\n\"I carefully reviewed the platform adopted at Chicago, and\r\nstudied its principles, but I know as much about it now as when\r\nI started to read it.  I gave intensive thought also to the\r\nspeech made by the Republican candidate, the purpose of which\r\nwas to interpret the meaning of that historic document, and\r\nafter long and vigilant labor I found two pronouncements.  What\r\nwas the first?  The statement that staggered the sensibilities of\r\nthe civilization of the world, the unthinkable, monstrous\r\nproposal, that in the midst of the uncertainty of the hour, a\r\nseparate peace ought to be made with Germany.  I want you to go\r\nback with me just a year and a half, to the time when victory\r\nwas son; to the time when our boys maintained their vigils on\r\nthe banks of the Rhine, standing there in solid formation with\r\n2,000,000 great lads behind them.  Germany signed the peace\r\ndocument on the dotted line.  What has happened in the united\r\nStates Senate to prevent its acceptance by the upper branch of\r\nthe American Congress?  I need not recall, because every child\r\nknows about it.  But the soldiers came back home; they were\r\ndemobilized; they entered into their several walks of life\r\nbelieving that their victory had been complete, and that the\r\noffending powers had been brought to terms.  And now, with the\r\narmies disbanded, and now, with our military strength no longer\r\nholding together, it is proposed by the candidate of the\r\nRepublican party that he will prove false to the boys who stood\r\nby when that peace was made.  He will destroy the pact and enter\r\ninto a new covenant.\r\n\r\n\"Six hundred thousand French died at Verdun defending the\r\nslogan, 'They shall not pass.'  More than a million English and\r\nCanadians died on the Somme, reforming their ranks, and hurling\r\nback the challenge, 'They shall not pass.'  They were possessed\r\nof the crusading spirit; they were preserving the Democracy of\r\nthe world, the very Government of the earth.  And now another\r\nmenace is threatened, and it is proposed that some one, acting\r\nin behalf of two millions of soldiers and the one hundred\r\nmillion people of this Republic, shall perform a perfectly\r\nperfidious act.  Standing at the head of the hosts of the great\r\narmy which opposes the hosts of reaction; standing at the head\r\nof the hosts of Democracy, at the head of the hosts of progress;\r\nat the head of the hundreds of thousands of independents of this\r\nCountry, I give to you this assurance:  That this dishonorable\r\ndeed will not be perpetrated--for two very important reasons.\r\nFirst, Warren G. Harding will not have a chance to do it; and\r\nsecond, I will not insult two million soldiers by doing it\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n\"And then proceeding to the second stage of these proceedings,\r\nthe Republican candidate says that after he shall have made a\r\nseparate peace with Germany, he will then assemble the\r\nconscience of the civilization of the world and form an entirely\r\nnew relationship.  If, for the sake of argument only, we are to\r\nassume that a separate peace with Germany were made, I believe\r\nthat the Government of the United States of America would be so\r\nunworthy in the eyes of the nations of the world that none of\r\nthem would have anything to do with us at all.\r\n\r\n\"This one question will remain in the public mind.  After all\r\nthis is the crux of the whole situation.  The Republican\r\ncandidate and the reactionaries now in control of the Republican\r\nparty, promise you nothing whatsoever except a proposal which at\r\nis best will involve months and probably years of delay.  On the\r\nother hand, we promise you this, that after the 4th of March,\r\n1921, with the least amount of conversation possible, we will\r\nenter the League of Nations of the world.  Our Democratic\r\nplatform adopted at San Francisco gives us full license and\r\nopportunity to enter the League upon terms which will need no\r\ndefense.  Our position is not unbending; it is not captious.  We\r\nproclaim that we will accept any conditions that interpret, that\r\ncall attention to the limitations of our Constitution; that\r\nserve full notice now upon the powers of the earth that we can\r\ngo so far and no further.\r\n\r\n\"In other words we have the opportunity of concluding this, the\r\ngreatest movement for righteousness in all the history of the\r\nworld, and then the loose ends of civilization will be put\r\ntogether.  The opportunity for exchange will have been restored.\r\nAmerica will proceed upon an era of prosperity and peace without\r\nprecedent.\r\n\r\n\"I shall address no audience in America this year without\r\npuncturing the smoke screen of hypocrisy and insincerity which\r\nhas been raised, in order that the reactionaries might creep in\r\nbehind it and claim their main objective, the spoils of office.\r\nThat smoke screen now is the statement that the League of\r\nNations increases the probabilities of war.  It would have been\r\njust as absurd to have said to the boys at the time our fathers\r\nwon their freedom, that if you proclaim your independence you are\r\ngoing to have war, because you will have to fight to retain it.\r\nEvery school boy in Ohio understands there are three branches of\r\nGovernment, Judicial, Legislative and Executive, and when war\r\nhas been brought to an end, the head of the Executive\r\nDepartment, the President of the United States, makes the treaty\r\nwith the power with which we have been at war, and then we find\r\nthat limitation of power.  The President can go no further.  He\r\nsubmits it to the Senate for ratification.  The President of the\r\nUnited States has very definite power, and there are also very\r\nspecific powers reserved to the Congress of the United States.\r\nThe Congress can do nothing contrary to the Constitution; the\r\nPresident can do nothing contrary to the Constitution.  The\r\nConstitution provides that war can be declared by Congress, and\r\nCongress only.  In order to give point and truth to what the\r\nreactionary leaders are now contending for, it would be\r\nnecessary to change the Constitution of the United States.  This\r\nwould require a two-thirds' vote of the House and Senate, and\r\nthen a three-fourths' vote of the states of the Union.  Our\r\nmachinery was so adjusted that no matter who might be the\r\nExecutive Officer of this Republic, he did not possess the power\r\nto declare war.  The power was placed as near to the people as it\r\nwas possible to place it.  It was placed with their\r\nRepresentatives in Congress.\r\n\r\n\"Now--the Republican leaders in contending that four or five\r\npotentates, four or five distinguished statesmen over seas,\r\nsitting in the council of the League of Nations, can order our\r\nsoldiers anywhere, are speaking a deliberate and a willful\r\nuntruth.  Presidential proprieties require that I do not\r\ncharacterize it in stronger language.  You know it is very hard\r\nto please the opposition, although we are under great debt to\r\nthem for having made the gauge of battle in this campaign.  The\r\nproposition to disgrace America by making a separate peace with\r\nGermany was simply opening their front lines.  I have already\r\nentered that opening with the hosts of Democracy around me.\r\n\r\n\"About three months ago a well-meaning Republican business man\r\nwas driving through Clark county.  His soldier boy was at the\r\nwheel, and he looked over into a field and saw a hundred trucks\r\nlying there; and he seized upon the circumstance to attack the\r\nAdministration at Washington.  The son had heard enough of it,\r\nand he stopped the car and said:  'Father, you have got to stop\r\ntalking that way.  When we were in the front trench we had warm\r\nfood, no matter whether we were in the midst of hell's fire or\r\nnot.  We had all the ammunition we needed.  It was ten times\r\nbetter to have more trucks than we needed than to have fewer\r\ntrucks than we needed.'  And then there is another reason for it\r\nall.  Need we be reminded that the opposition said that it would\r\nrequire Secretary Baker and President Wilson eighteen months to\r\ntake 600,000 soldiers over seas, and, recognizing that it would\r\nrequire in all probability more than 2,000,000 soldiers to win\r\nthe war, that the war would then last, under this Democratic\r\nAdministration, four times eighteen months.  Any child in this\r\ncountry can have the facts presented to him and he will have the\r\nmentality to grasp these outstanding circumstances:  President\r\nWilson and Secretary Baker, at the head of the military forces\r\nof the nation did not send 600,000 soldiers over in eighteen\r\nmonths' time.  They sent 2,000,000 soldiers over in eighteen\r\nmonths' time, and won the war without the loss of a single troop\r\nship.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nHOW HE HAS DEALT WITH LABOR TROUBLES\r\n\r\n\r\nNo subject furnishes so good an index to the entire record of an\r\nexecutive as the manner in which he has handled the affairs\r\ngrowing out of industrial disputes.  Touching, as they often do,\r\na zone of disputed claims, and involving, as they often do, the\r\nsocial rights of workers no less than the rights of property,\r\nand entailing, as they frequently have, the duty of maintaining\r\npublic order, the conflicts between capital and labor test to\r\nthe utmost the abilities of the Executive Officer of a great\r\nindustrial state like Ohio.  Within its borders are toilers from\r\nevery land and every clime.  In her cities dwell as laborers men\r\nand women from every known country and representative of every\r\nrace--a modern Babel of tongues with a greater variety, were it\r\npossible, than those upon whom fell confusion of speech in the\r\nages gone.\r\n\r\nAnd the period during which Governor Cox has held away has been\r\none of profound upheavals.  There have been strikes brought forth\r\nby \"hard times,\" strikes occasioned by efforts at organization\r\nof workers, and strikes whose distant origin lay in the economic\r\noverturn incident to war inflation with its topsy-turvy of\r\nvalues and its jumble of the normal status.  These conditions,\r\nthen, supply a complete and ample test of the effectiveness of\r\nthe policy which has been followed.  The results of this policy\r\nare told in a brief statement by Mr. Oscar W. Newman, Associate\r\nJustice of the Ohio Supreme Court.  He said:  \"Not a soldier was\r\nbrought to the scene of a single strike (although they were in\r\nreadiness for emergency); person and property were preserved;\r\nand above all, the dignity of the law was maintained.\"\r\n\r\nNor has capital been offended by the methods pursued.  This fact\r\nis attested by statements of those who speak for invested\r\nindustrial wealth.  Thus, W. S. Thomas, of Springfield, says that\r\nthe policies pursued have made \"Ohio an oasis in the widespread\r\narea of industrial turmoil during and since the great war.\"\r\n\r\nThere are cited, too, the conclusions reached by Thomas J.\r\nDonnelly, Secretary of the Ohio Federation of labor, who has\r\nwritten:\r\n\r\n\"Labor has confidence in James M. Cox because the laboring\r\npeople feel that he understands their needs and is in hearty\r\nsympathy with the progressive aspirations of those who earn\r\ntheir bread by the sweat of their brows.  As governor, he\r\naccomplished more in the interest of the laboring people of Ohio\r\nand is held in higher esteem by them than any other governor in\r\nthe state's history.\r\n\r\n\"He has done much to avoid and to settle labor troubles.  He\r\nbelieves that more can be accomplished through reason and common\r\nsense than through force and intimidation; and whenever called\r\nupon to send the militia to deal with striking workmen, he\r\nalways found a way to prevent violence and preserve order\r\nwithout using soldiers for that purpose.  During the big steel\r\nstrike when violence and disorder were rampant in some states\r\nwhere the right peaceably to assemble had been denied to the\r\nstriking workers, in Ohio, where there were equally as many\r\nstrikers involved, there was no sign of violence, and the right\r\nof workers peaceably to assembled was not interfered with.  If\r\nhis policy had been followed by other public officials\r\nthroughout the nation, there would be less unrest and the people\r\nwould have more confidence in the fairness of government\r\nauthorities.\"\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to get a comprehensive view of Governor\r\nCox's record with respect to labor troubles to tell the plain\r\nstory of what he has done.  He had scarce taken hold as Governor\r\nin 1913 when a strike broke out in the great rubber plants of\r\nAkron.  It seemed to have been fomented by members of the\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World, but it drew in its train\r\nthousands upon thousands of other workers until the great plants\r\nwere practically idle.  In Akron, where a heterogenous collection\r\nof industrial workers dwell, idleness was a potent factor in\r\nfomenting disorder.  The normal course of affairs would have been\r\nan attempt to operate the plants with strike breakers under\r\nguard, provocative acts upon both sides, and finally, recourse\r\nto an armed militia to quell the disorder after the inevitable\r\nbloodshed had ensued.  Although new in executive experience,\r\nGovernor Cox took another course.  He sent trained and trusted\r\ninvestigators to Akron who learned the facts and reported to him\r\naccurately upon the situation, including also the grievances of\r\nthe toilers.  At the same time he gave warning to the local\r\nauthorities that they preserve a strict neutrality in their\r\ndealing with the contending forces, and he uttered a solemn\r\nwarning that the laws must be respected, assuring those of both\r\ncontending factions that public opinion within the city would\r\nspeedily ascertain the right and wrong of the controversy.  And\r\nso it proved to be.  But learning there were abuses in the plants\r\nthat needed correction the Governor gave his assent to an\r\ninvestigation by a legislative committee through the helpful\r\npublicity of which all interests were induced to redress certain\r\ngrievances.  It gave an object lesson not only to Akron but to\r\nall the state.  It taught even the turbulent element that only\r\nharm could come through infraction of the law and through\r\ndisrespect for rights of person and property.  The remainder of\r\nthe  story is that I. W. W. disturbers have more sterile soil in\r\nOhio to cultivate than in any of the states about it.\r\n\r\nA startling comparison two years later at East Youngstown,\r\nduring the administration of Governor Cox's successor, disclosed\r\nby contrast the value of the peaceful plan.  Through a policy of\r\nuncertainty and wavering, a riot was allowed to start and\r\nmilitary were needed to put down the disorder, life being lost\r\nin the process.\r\n\r\nThe details of the incidents of similar nature to that of Akron\r\nneed not be recounted here, but the invariable policy pursued\r\nwas the collection of all the facts, so far as possible, by a\r\nrepresentative of capital and one of labor.  Of this course, the\r\nsimple statement can be made that it was eminently successful.\r\n\r\nThis recital has been made as a preliminary to the narrative of\r\nthe great steel strike of 1919 on which the Governor's fame as\r\nan administrator in troubled times largely rests.  The same\r\npolicy of investigation and research was pursued.  Solemn warning\r\nwas given that freedom of speech and assembly must be respected\r\nrigidly but that neither must become the instrument of license\r\nnor of subversive speech or conduct.  At the time when the\r\nsituation reached a critical stage the Governor issued this\r\nstatement:\r\n\r\n\"To the Mayors of municipalities and County Sheriffs of Ohio:\r\n\r\n\"I am impressed with the importance of a statement to the mayors\r\nand sheriffs as to a policy which should serve as a guide to\r\ngovernment, both state and local, in the matter of turbulent\r\nconditions which have developed in many communities, from\r\npending industrial disputes.\r\n\r\n\"We have inquiry at the executive office from local officials\r\nclearly indicating that no rule of action has been developed in\r\nthe face of present emergencies and further that none is in\r\nprospect.  The constitution imposes upon the Governor the very\r\ndefinite responsibility of law enforcement.  While it is the duty\r\nof the mayor of a municipality and the sheriff of the county to\r\nexecute the laws, the founders of our charter of government gave\r\nto the state executive, not only the right to keep vigilant eye\r\non conditions in every community, but his oath imposes the\r\nobligation so to do.  Therefore, in no part of the state must a\r\npublic officer permit the violation of the law.  The mayors and\r\nsheriffs seem to have proper concept of their duty in the\r\nabstract.  The purpose of this statement is to deal with\r\nspecifications.\r\n\r\n\"The sections of the state which give the greatest concern have\r\nlarge masses of alien residents.  Thousands of them do not speak\r\nthe language.  They are not familiar with our laws but it is safe\r\nto assume that the individual conscience tells every man that\r\nviolence is both a moral and a legal wrong.\r\n\r\n\"Officers of companies whose manufacturing plants are closed by\r\nstrike or other cause have expressed to me the intention to\r\nresume operations.  At the same time they have asked for\r\n'protection.'  Inquiry develops this fact--that some employers\r\nbelieve it the duty of government to transport their employees\r\ninto and out of the plants in question.  This is not a function\r\nof government.  Throughout the years, the policy has been not to\r\nmake use of soldiers nor policemen to man street cars, for\r\ninstance, nor in any way to make of them the instruments to\r\nbring a strike to an end.  If either state or local officers\r\nprovided safe conveyance of workmen into or out of a\r\nmanufacturing institution, then government would be making of\r\nitself the agent of one of the parties to the dispute.  If,\r\nhowever, the plant resumes, and disorder of any sort ensues as\r\nthe result of employees going into or out of the factory, then\r\nthat becomes an affair of governmental concern and the mayor of\r\nthe municipality or the sheriff of the county, as location\r\nwithin or without the municipality largely determines, must\r\nsuppress violence and arrest those who violate the law.  I shall\r\nexact this from all local officers.\r\n\r\n\"Picketing as we understand it is neither prohibited by law nor\r\ncondemned by public sentiment, but it must go no further than\r\nmoral persuasion.  Organized society cannot continue without\r\ngovernment, and government will not live unless the laws are\r\nrespected.  They not only express what experience has taught us,\r\nbut they are the official mandate of the will of the majority,\r\nand after all, that is a fundamental principle in a republic.\r\n\r\n\"All officers must act with care.  It will be found that trouble\r\ncan often be avoided by an open, frank and firm contact of\r\npublic officers with both the representatives of the employers\r\nand employees.  No call that I have ever made upon either side of\r\nthese controversies has ever gone unheeded.\r\n\r\n\"We are in the midst of unprecedented conditions, but if we\r\ndevote ourselves to the single thought of making government the\r\nagency of justice and the instrument of bringing swift\r\npunishment to those who violate the laws of this commonwealth,\r\nwe will pass through the storm safely.\r\n\r\n\"No man must be permitted to define the rules of his individual\r\nconduct.  The law is supreme.  I shall expect its enforcement by\r\nlocal officers.  When they have rendered their utmost effort and\r\nfailed to meet conditions, then the state will act promptly.\"\r\n\r\nIn every city in Ohio, save one, this warning was sufficient,\r\nbut in Canton it became necessary for the Governor to remove the\r\nmayor.  His successor speedily re-established the peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nHOW HE HAS DEALT WITH INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of the result of Governor Cox's treatment of\r\nindustrial issues is told in his parallel of statements from\r\nThomas J. Donnelly, Secretary of the Ohio Federation of Labor,\r\nand W. S. Thomas, a leading manufacturer.\r\n\r\nStatement by Donnelly:\r\n\r\n\"Before Ohio had a Workmen's Compensation Law, only twenty per\r\ncent of the injured workers, or the widows and children of\r\ndeceased workers, were paid any compensation or damages.  Eighty\r\nper cent got nothing whatever.  When Cox was first elected\r\ngovernor, about five per cent of the workers of Ohio were\r\ncovered under an optional Workmen's Compensation Law.  His first\r\nmove as governor was to insist upon the passage of a Workmen's\r\nCompensation Law that would benefit all the workers.  In this he\r\nmet with powerful and bitter opposition.  But through his\r\ndetermined efforts the opposition was overcome and the law was\r\npassed.  To-day the Ohio State Insurance Fund is the largest\r\ncarrier of workmen's compensation insurance, public or private,\r\nin the world.  More than a million dollars a month is being\r\ncollected by this fund, all of which is paid out for\r\ncompensation and medical treatment for the injured workers or\r\nthe dependents of those who are killed in the course of\r\nemployment.  This law supplied such an urgent need in the state\r\nthat the employers and the laboring people of Ohio now look upon\r\nit as an accomplishment that outshines any other achievement in\r\nthe state's history.\r\n\r\n\"The report of the legislative agents of the Ohio State\r\nFederation of Labor show that fifty-six laws in behalf of\r\nlaboring people were passed during Cox's three terms as\r\ngovernor.  Among these were laws forbidding the exploitation of\r\nwomen and children and limiting their hours of labor, providing\r\nfor mothers' pensions, providing for safety codes to protect\r\nlife, limb and health and numerous other beneficent measures.\"\r\n\r\nStatement by Thomas:\r\n\r\n\"His strong sense of right and wrong, and the exercise of an\r\nunusual common sense, together with his frankness and courage in\r\nexpression, have been the controlling factors in his successful\r\nrelationship with the business interests of the state.\r\n\r\n\"A single example of his wisdom will illustrate this.  For years\r\norganized labor and organized capital in Ohio have met during\r\nthe sessions of the general assembly in what seemed to be a\r\nnecessary antagonism.  This was evidenced by the opposition of\r\neach to the proposed measures of the other.  The result was ill\r\nfeeling and little accomplished for either.  It was Governor\r\nCox's suggestion that these organizations, represented by the\r\nState Federation of Labor and the Ohio Manufacturers'\r\nAssociation, through their executive officers, should meet\r\ntogether and discuss pending legislation relating to the\r\ninterest of either.  Finally this plan was adopted, and it is the\r\ntestimony of those participating tat it did much to avoid\r\nmisunderstandings, and contributed a great deal towards sane and\r\nsafe legislation.  There is not known any instance of this plan\r\nbeing adopted in any other state of the Union.  The fruit of this\r\nsensible procedure is that there are no laws in Ohio that hamper\r\nindustry, impede business or endanger property interests, and at\r\nthe same time the state is foremost in legislation that promotes\r\nsocial welfare, gives labor its due, and helps the weak and\r\nneedy.\r\n\r\n\"A man who has occupied this position without interruption\r\nduring three administrations would be a failure at the very\r\noutstart if he resorted to devious conduct or political\r\nduplicity.  He has but one master--the people at large.  To reach\r\nthis position he had to have courage, be truthful, exercise\r\nsound and practical business judgment, and at the same time have\r\na vision looking to the betterment of the condition of his\r\nfellow-man.\"\r\n\r\nThe cornerstone of the labor legislation is the Workmen's\r\nCompensation Law, the story of which is told in the state\r\narchives, in the messages to the Ohio General Assembly.  At the\r\nbeginning of his first term as Governor in 1913, Governor Cox\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"It would certainly be common bad faith not to pass a compulsory\r\nWorkmen's Compensation Law.  No subject was discussed during the\r\nlast campaign with greater elaboration, and it must be stated to\r\nthe credit of our citizenship generally that regardless of the\r\ndifferences of opinion existing for many years, the justice of\r\nthe compulsory feature is now admitted.  Much of the criticism of\r\nthe courts has been due to the trials of personal injury cases\r\nunder the principles of practice which held the fellow-servant\r\nrule, and assumption of risk and contributory negligence to be\r\ngrounds of defense.  The layman reaches his conclusion with\r\nrespect to justice along the lines of common sense, and the\r\npractice in personal injury cases has been so sharply in\r\nconflict with the plain fundamentals of right, that social\r\nunrest has been much contributed to.  A second phase of this\r\nwhole subject which has been noted in the development of the\r\ngreat industrialism of the day has been the inevitable animosity\r\nbetween capital and labor through the ceaseless litigation\r\ngrowing out of these cases.  The individual or the corporation\r\nthat employs on a large scale has taken insurance in liability\r\ncompanies, and, in too many instances, cases which admitted of\r\nlittle difference of opinion have been carried into the courts.\r\nThe third injustice has been the waste occasioned by the system.\r\nThe injured workman or the family deprived of its support by\r\naccident is not so circumstanced that the case can be contested\r\nwith the corporation to the court of last resort.  The need of\r\nfunds compels compromise on a base that is not always equitable.\r\nHuman nature many times drives sharp bargains that can hardly be\r\nendorsed by the moral scale.  In the final analysis the cost of\r\nattorney fees is so heavy that the amount which finally accrues\r\nin cases of accident is seriously curtailed before it reaches\r\nthe beneficiary.  These three considerations clearly suggest the\r\nlifting of this whole operation out of the courts and the sphere\r\nof legal disputation.  And then there is a broader principle\r\nwhich must be recognized.  There is no characteristic of our\r\ncivilization so marked as the element of interdependence as\r\nbetween social units.  We are all dependent upon our fellows in\r\none way or another.  Some occupations, however, are more\r\nhazardous than others and the rule of the past in compelling\r\nthose engaged in dangerous activities to bear unaided the burden\r\nof this great risk, is not right.  The Workmen's Compensation Law\r\nin this state, which, however, lacks the compulsory feature, has\r\nmade steady growth in popularity.  The heavy decrease in rates\r\nclearly indicates economy and efficiency in the administration\r\nof the state liability board of awards.  The compulsory feature,\r\nhowever, should at once be added.  I respectfully but very\r\nearnestly urge its adoption amendatory of the present law with\r\nsuch other changes as experience might dictate.\r\n\r\n\"The objective to be sought is the fullest measure of protection\r\nto those engaged in dangerous occupations with the least burden\r\nof cost to society, because after all the social organization\r\nmust pay for it.  The ultimate result of this law will be the\r\nreduction in death and accident because not only the\r\nhumanitarian but the commercial consideration will suggest the\r\nnecessity of installing and maintaining with more vigilance\r\nmodern safety devices.\r\n\r\n\"Government as a science must make its improvement along the\r\nsame practical lines which develop system, simplification,\r\nclassification of kindred activities, and better administrative\r\ndirection in the evolution of business.  A private or corporate\r\nenterprise is compelled to promote in the highest degree both\r\nefficiency and economy because its income is subject to the\r\nhazards of business.  Government without this spur of necessity\r\nbecause its revenue is both regular and certain, does not effect\r\nreorganizations and combine common activities so readily.  One\r\nreason, of course, is that new legislation is required and that\r\nis not easy at all times.  Wherever human energies are now being\r\ndirected toward more efficient public service, we find the\r\nconsolidation under one administrative unit or bureau of all\r\ndepartments which deal either in direct or different manner with\r\nthe same general subject.  Investigation develops many\r\nduplications in both labor and expense in the departments of the\r\nstate.  No business institution would continue such a policy and\r\nrecognizing now the importance of conducting the business of the\r\ncommonwealth along the same modern and efficient lines of\r\nprivate and corporate operations, there is submitted herewith to\r\nyour honorable body two recommendations which, in my judgment,\r\nare of tremendous importance, namely, the creation of an\r\nIndustrial Commission and a Department of Agriculture.  The first\r\nnamed organization would combine every existing department which\r\ndeals with the relation between capital and labor.  It is\r\ncertainly a logical observation that the department heads\r\nclothed with the responsibility of details will find it\r\nextremely difficult to rise to the moral vision necessary to\r\nconstruct and conserve policies dealing with big things.  Besides\r\nduplication of service is a waste of both human energy and state\r\nfunds.\"\r\n\r\nIn summing up the results of a single year of Workmen's\r\nCompensation Law, the Governor at the beginning of 1915 said:\r\n\r\n\"The humane results of the Workmen's compensation Law have been\r\nso widespread and the wisdom of the people in changing the\r\nconstitution so as to make this plan compulsory has been so\r\ncompletely demonstrated that manufacturer and employee now join\r\nin praise of the act.  While the liability insurance companies\r\ncontend that the State could not administer this trust and that\r\nthe cost would run into millions of dollars per year, the\r\nexperience of the first twelve months shows the cost of the\r\nadministration to be approximately $160,000; and the claims,\r\nrunning far in excess of 50,000 in number, have been adjudicated\r\nwith such promptness as to justify in the fullest measure the\r\nsoundness of the State plan.  The balance in the fund December\r\n15, 1914, was $2,418,414.07.  The number of accidents is\r\ndiminishing and the cost to the employer is decreasing; so that\r\nboth lower rates and larger compensation seem assured.  As one\r\nwho passed through the stormy period that led to the passage of\r\nthis law, I urge upon you the extreme importance of the highest\r\nmanifestations of vigilance, patriotism and humanity in order\r\nthat the fundamentals of this beneficent legislation may be\r\npreserved.  Under the pretext of improving the law it can be\r\neasily emasculated.  Ohio assumed the lead in this legislation,\r\nand if the fundamental principle is maintained here, the plan,\r\nby its demonstrated worth, will be adopted elsewhere.  This means\r\nthe ultimate loss of ill-gotten millions by potential interests\r\nthat have grown rich from the tears, blood and maimed bodies of\r\nour working people.  They will not give it up without a continued\r\nstruggle.  Your duty to humanity and to your State calls for\r\nextreme watchfulness.\r\n\r\nThough he suffered defeat for re-election in 1914, neither the\r\nIndustrial Commission Law nor the Workmen's compensation Law nor\r\nany other major piece of social legislation was disturbed by his\r\nsuccessor.  In reviewing four years of the history of the law at\r\nhis re-accession to power in 1917, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Since the adoption of the law there have been 300,000\r\nindustrial accidents and only seventeen suits have been brought\r\nagainst employers who paid into the state insurance fund.  There\r\nwas but one single verdict rendered by the court against the\r\nemployer in the list of seventeen and that was for $2000.  Five\r\ncases were settled out of court, four were decided in favor of\r\nthe employer, one was dismissed by the employee, one was\r\ndismissed by the court and four are still pending.  More than one\r\nthousand firms carry their own insurance under state consent,\r\nand against these institutions but five suits have been brought.\r\nAgainst the employers who have reinsured with the liability\r\ninsurance companies, eight suits have been instituted, making a\r\ntotal of thirty law suits from all sources.  These figures are\r\nprocured from the official records of the Industrial\r\nCommission.\"\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1919, a further chapter is given:\r\n\r\n\"The experience of our state with the Compulsory Workmen's\r\nCompensation Law bears so vitally on the industrial life of our\r\npeople that it is deemed proper to report the outstanding\r\nfeatures of the situation.  The amount of money in the fund held\r\nby the State as trustee for the injured workmen and their\r\ndependents, as of date, January 2, 1919, was $15,401,429.74.\r\nSo carefully measured has been the cost of human justice that\r\nemployers pay a smaller premium-rate in Ohio than elsewhere, and\r\nthe injured workmen and their dependents are given larger\r\ncompensation.  A dramatic circumstance which bears eloquent\r\ntestimony in behalf of this law is here recited:  Not long since\r\na workman was injured in a factory through which runs the\r\nboundary line between Ohio and Pennsylvania.  The accident\r\noccurred a few feet east of our state, but the poor fellow\r\ncrawled back onto the soil of Ohio because he knew the\r\ndifference between our law and the law in Pennsylvania.  As a\r\nfurther evidence of the basic soundness of the law and the\r\ncharacter of its administration, I have directed the Industrial\r\nCommission to have an actuarial audit of the fund in its charge,\r\nwith the imposed condition that the Ohio Federation of Labor,\r\nthe Ohio Manufacturers' Association and the State Auditor be\r\nconsulted in the employment of the most competent actuary,\r\nobtainable outside the state service, to do the work.\"\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the story, but not all of it.  Having its genesis\r\nin the meetings between labor and capital, there has been worked\r\nout by the two an elaborate code of safety rules which have been\r\nofficially promulgated by the commission and have the binding\r\neffect of law.  To-day capital and labor will demand of his\r\nsuccessor that his heart and mind be in accord with the program\r\ncarried to fruition in his six years as Governor.  There are\r\nother points in his service, briefly covered here, in these\r\nlists:\r\n\r\n\r\nLaws Pertaining to Business\r\n\r\nA public utilities law providing property re-valuation as a\r\nbasis for rate making.\r\n\r\nProvision for court appear from the utilities commission\r\ndecision to the court of final jurisdiction, preventing delay\r\nand loss.\r\n\r\nProhibition against injunction on rate hearing without court\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\nA uniform accounting system applied to utilities.\r\n\r\nA state banking code with close co-operation with the federal\r\nreserve system, bringing all private banks under state\r\nsupervision.\r\n\r\nState expenditure on a budget system to reduce cost of\r\ngovernment and lessen taxation.\r\n\r\nA blue-sky act to encourage proper investment and protect\r\nagainst fraudulent securities.\r\n\r\n\r\nLabor Legislation\r\n\r\nA State Industrial Commission with powers to handle all\r\nquestions affecting capital and labor, with a state mediator as\r\nthe keystone.\r\n\r\nComplete survey of occupational diseases with recommendation for\r\nhealth and occupational insurance.\r\n\r\nFull switching crew in all railroad yards.\r\n\r\nStrengthening the user in the state of railroad safety\r\nappliances.\r\n\r\nA full crew law.\r\n\r\nTwenty-four foot caboose.\r\n\r\nReduction of consecutive hours of employment for electric\r\nrailroad workers.\r\n\r\nObstruction of fixed signals prohibited.\r\n\r\nSafeguarding of accidents in mines by proper illumination.\r\n\r\nExtra provision for dependents of men killed in mines.\r\n\r\nIncreased facilities for mine inspector operation.\r\n\r\nProtection of miners working toward abandoned mines.\r\n\r\nElimination of sweatshop labor.\r\n\r\nProvision for minimum time pay day.\r\n\r\nProhibition of contract labor in workhouses.\r\n\r\nProvision for minimum wage and nine-hour working day for women.\r\n\r\nEight-hour working day on all public contracts.\r\n\r\nCodification of child laws with establishment of child welfare\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nCompulsory provision for mothers' pensions.\r\n\r\nVerdict by three-fourths jury in civil cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE LEADER OF THE STATE IN WAR--VISION IN\r\nGOVERNMENT IN PEACE TIME\r\n\r\n\r\nTheodore Roosevelt said that Governor Cox was among the very\r\nforemost of war Governors.  The utterance was made after he\r\nhad assessed the things done during the fateful period of\r\nhostilities.  Presenting complicated problems at all time it was\r\nno less true that in war there were major, not minor, obstacles\r\nto be met and surmounted before Ohio might take her traditional\r\nplace as one of the very militant states of the Union.  That she\r\ndid achieve such place attests the zeal and ardor of the\r\nGovernor.  Ohio presented to the country a complete division, the\r\nThirty-seventh, recruited under the personal supervision of\r\nGovernor Cox.  It led the nation, by long odds, in sale of war\r\nsaving stamps, an activity stimulated by Governor Cox.  It\r\npreserved good order and set an example in spite of many\r\nconflicting racial antagonisms within its borders by cultivation\r\nof such a spirit as made open or covert disloyalty dangerous to\r\nthe disloyal.  Withal there was no untoward incident affecting\r\npeaceful alien enemies.  In the cities, none led those of Ohio in\r\nwar gardening, and the tractor campaign for Ohio farms was\r\nadopted and imitated in other states.  The Governor himself was a\r\ndynamo of activity, organizing the first State Council of\r\nDefense and enlisting volunteer aid at no expense to state and\r\ncountry in quickening all war and related activities.  Every\r\nsituation affecting the State's power found him ready for the\r\nemergency.  When an early frost and severe winter in 1917-18\r\ndestroyed much of the seed corn, the Governor uncovered\r\ninstances of profiteering and immediately stopped it by vigorous\r\naction.  Corn in other districts with similar soil and climate\r\nwas brought in and sold at three dollars a bushel.\r\n\r\nSoldiers of no state were better supplied with all the comforts\r\nthat could be provided than those of Ohio.  While the Thirty-\r\nseventh was in camp in the far South a Christmas train was sent\r\nto it.  Special funds were raised for entertainment of both the\r\nOhio camps.  In a word, every war activity felt the vigilant care\r\nand sympathetic help of the Governor.\r\n\r\nDuring the war time there were few idle men in Ohio.  Through\r\nproclamation attention of local authorities was directed to an\r\nold law making vagrancy an offense and it was applied\r\nrigorously.\r\n\r\nNo less in reconstruction than in was activities his energies\r\nwere tireless.  The Governor took the lead in securing\r\nlegislation to correct the defects found in educational laws and\r\none of the statutes placed upon the books at his suggestion\r\nprovided for an oath of allegiance on the part of teachers.\r\nReferring to disclosures in certain cities, he said:  \"We have\r\nhad our bitter experiences and love for our children compels us,\r\nin common prudence, to protect them.\"\r\n\r\nWithout sympathy for the mischievous spirits who sought to\r\nfoment trouble in America, the Governor clearly expressed his\r\nconception of Americanization as a voluntary spiritual, and not\r\na compulsory, process.  The policy he had in mind was indicated\r\nin an address in Chicago in March, 1920, in which he said:\r\n\r\n\"There must be no compromise with treason, but the surest death\r\nto Bolshevism is exposure of the germ of the disease itself to\r\nthe sunlight of public view.  We must protect ourselves against\r\nextremes in America.  The horrors and tragedies of revolution can\r\nbe charged to them.  If government is assailed, its policy must\r\nnot become vengeful.  Our fathers in specifying what human\r\nfreedom was, and providing guarantees for its preservation,\r\nrecognized that among the necessary precautions was the\r\nprotection of individual right against governmental abuses.\r\n\r\n\"If the alien, ignorant of our laws and customs, cows in fear of\r\nour government, he is very apt to believe that things are much\r\nthe same the world over, and he may become and easy convert to\r\nthe doctrine of resistance.  The skies will clear but meanwhile\r\ngovernment must be firm, yet judicial, uninfluenced by the\r\nemotionalism that breeds extremes.  The less government we have,\r\nconsistent with safety to life and property, the better for both\r\nhappiness and morals.  A policeman on every corner would be a bad\r\nindex to the citizenship of the community, for it would reflect\r\na foolish concept of conditions by the municipal officers.\"\r\n\r\nThe vision of Governor Cox in legislation is best to be studied\r\nin the statute book of Ohio.  The fact is that he was a pioneer\r\nin some of this, indeed in a large part of it.  Through the years\r\nhe has insisted that government must deal with its problem by\r\nevolution lest revolution overtake it.  It was this sentiment\r\nthat led him to deal with the industrial injury matter.  When he\r\nheard men inveighing against the courts, a discerning eye knew\r\nsomething was wrong and he gave his attention to righting that\r\nwrong.  His creed, not recently as a candidate, but in the years\r\nof his public career, has been expressed in this summary:  \"Our\r\nview is toward the sunrise of tomorrow with its progress and its\r\neternal promise of better things.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression is found so frequently in his state documents\r\nthat it might properly be set forth in the form of a creed.  But\r\nthere has been more than what the great Roosevelt called \"lip-\r\nservice to progress.  The forward steps became a part of the\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nIn health affairs he asked for the appointment of a commission\r\nto study the need for adequate local administration and he urged\r\nits adoption before the General Assembly so forcefully that Ohio\r\nto-day has what is universally recognized to be the best system\r\nin America.  In placing the state department upon a footing\r\ncommensurate with other institutions of government, case was\r\ntaken to place it where it cannot be prostituted to\r\npartisanship.  There has been a growing number of governmental\r\ndepartments under Governor Cox in which partisanship is utterly\r\nforbidden.  They include the Board of Administration, dealing\r\nwith the wards of the state, the social agencies, the\r\neducational, and the Fish and Game Department.  An actual census\r\nin all the varied public office activities in Ohio would\r\ndisclose that although the Democratic party has been in\r\npossession of the Government for nearly all of the past twelve\r\nyears, the number of members of the Republican party on the\r\npublic rolls is almost as great as that of the victors.  The\r\nGovernor has found that men in the world of business employ, at\r\nlarger compensation than the state has afforded, the type of men\r\nhe has most often selected for responsible posts.  It is one of\r\nthe curious effects of progress in government that it has\r\ntouched and awakened progress in business and in civic life.\r\n\r\nIn social service there has been evolved the cold storage act\r\nwhich has served as a model for proposed national legislation.\r\nunder its provisions a strict limitation of time is placed upon\r\nthe storing of food.  With this has gone strict legislation\r\nagainst adulteration of food and honest enforcement of the laws.\r\n\r\nOther states have accepted as a model the social agency\r\ncommittee now working in effective co-operation with state\r\ndepartments and bringing into mutual operation all recognized\r\nsocial agencies.  One of the greatest steps forward was the\r\nestablishment of a bureau of juvenile research with Dr. L. H.\r\nGoddard at its head.\r\n\r\nSecond to no other reform has been that effected in handling of\r\nthe prison problem.  Prisoners now earn their freedom through\r\nwork in the healthful out-of-doors on highways, in plants for\r\nmaking road material, and on farms.  There is a system of\r\ncompensation to the families for work done as a balance on which\r\nto begin life anew.\r\n\r\nTwelve hundred consolidated schools in Ohio attest the\r\nsuccessful workings of the rural school code which was brought\r\ninto existence in 1914 after careful study and after the state\r\nin general meetings had carefully studied the plans.  The old\r\none-room school house is giving way in the country to the modern\r\ncentralized school and community life is being remade.  Through\r\nthe raising of the country school to the plane of those of the\r\ncities, it will be possible to check the alarming drift to the\r\ncities and depopulation of the countryside.  Governor Cox does\r\nnot believe that the federal government should interfere in the\r\naffairs of local communities but he does believe that it \"can\r\ninventory the possibilities of progressive education, and in\r\nhelpful manner create an enlarged public interest in this\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\nAlong with the improvement of rural schools has gone a most\r\ncomprehensive highway programme involving an annual outlay of\r\nmillions of dollars.  Gradually as highways are improved they\r\nwill, under the state policy shaped in 1913, be taken over by\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\nThe agricultural legislation was in consonance with the other\r\nsubjects touched.  Ohio was long a dumping ground for inferior\r\nfertilizers, diseased livestock and impure seed.  Adequate laws\r\nhave changed all this.  Still, these are police measures not of\r\nnecessity a true index of real vision in agricultural matters.\r\nThe boldest step ever taken was the establishment of pure bred\r\nherds of cattle by the state with opportunity afforded through\r\nbreeding service at institutional farms to extend these pure\r\nstrains to the small farms.  The success attained is reflected in\r\nnumerous heard of thorough-bred cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFIGHTING \"SLUSH FUNDS\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopments of the present campaign have given a peculiar\r\ninterest to past history with respect to the record of Governor\r\nCox in dealing with campaign expenditures.  The Governor's\r\nreports, which have been filed under the Ohio Corrupt Practice\r\nlaw, show that he has never been an extravagant spender in\r\ncampaigns.  In his various races for the Governor's office in\r\nOhio one of the points which he has claimed is the redemption of\r\npledges made to the people.  Under one of these pledges he\r\nadvocated and secured the enactment of an anti-lobby law,\r\ndesigned to reduce the evils attendant upon the presence of a\r\nlegislative lobby.  He found upon the statute books of Ohio a\r\ncorrupt practice act and this was strengthened by laws passed\r\nduring his term.  In taking hold as Governor in 1913, he demanded\r\nand secured a rigid lobby law.  Of this he said:\r\n\r\n\"Conditions not only justify but demand drastic anti-lobby law.\r\nAny person interesting himself in legislation will not, if his\r\nmotive and cause be just, object to registering his name,\r\nresidence and the matters he is espousing, with the secretary of\r\nstate, or some other authority designated by your body.  If his\r\nactivities be of such nature that he does not care to reveal\r\nthem in the manner indicated, then the public interest is\r\nobviously endangered.  It is no more than a prudent safeguard to\r\nhave it known what influences are at work with respect to\r\nlegislation.  There ought to be no temporizing with this\r\nsituation.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first year of his administration he combated an attempt\r\nto annul the workmen's compensation law by an improper\r\nreferendum and vigorously cleaned up the situation by causing\r\nthe arrest of those who had conspired to falsify names to\r\npetitions.  The Governor followed up his activity for clean\r\nadministration of the referendum system by comprehensive laws in\r\n1914, since when no abuses have been discovered.  What he said to\r\nthe General Assembly gave a further indication of his policy in\r\nthis respect.  He said:\r\n\r\n\"The underlying spirit of the corrupt practice laws in the state\r\nand nation is the ascertainment of the influences behind\r\ncandidates or measures.  We can with profit compel a sworn\r\nitemized statement when the petition is filed showing all money\r\nor things of value paid, given or promised for circulating such\r\npetitions.\"\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1916, in which Governor Cox was re-elected,\r\nassertions were made of large improper expenditure of money in\r\ndefiance of the law.  In the following January at the regular\r\nsession of the General Assembly, the Governor indicated his\r\nposition by calling for a special legislative inquiry.  The\r\nstatements he made furnish an interesting background for the\r\ndevelopments of the year.  At that time he said:\r\n\r\n\"Let me lay particular emphasis on the necessity of safeguarding\r\nthe suffrage thought of the state from the dangers of corrupt\r\ninfluences.  The sums of money expended for so-called political\r\npurposes are assuming such magnitude as to cause seemingly well-\r\nfounded alarm, if not to justify the belief that the legitimate\r\npurpose of campaigning is being exceeded.  Unfettered by law,\r\nthis tendency might result in the waters of our free\r\ninstitutions being poisoned at their very base.  Reduced to\r\nsimple terms, the object of a campaign is to inform the voters\r\non every subject that legitimately and germanely joins to the\r\nissues and the candidates.  Any step beyond this, and any project\r\nopposed to it in motive, cannot but be regarded as dangerous.\r\nHuman frailties should not be played upon by vast treasures of\r\nmoney advanced by men or movements whose huge disbursements can\r\nhardly be looked upon as of patriotic inspiration.  It is not\r\nnecessary to expend large amounts of money for the promotion of\r\na worthy cause, and, inversely, any cause or candidacy having\r\nbehind it unprecedented financial support is likely to be\r\nregarded with suspicion.  It may, through legislation, be\r\nnecessary to restrain irresponsible organizations whose\r\nexistence and activities are born of a hidden design, conceived\r\nby some interest afraid to operate in the open.  I recommend that\r\na legislative committee of investigation be appointed with the\r\npower to employ counsel, and the authority to summon persons and\r\npapers and to swear witnesses in order that it might be known\r\njust what organizations have been entering into campaign\r\nactivities, and how much money they expended and collected--also\r\nthe names of the contributors.  This should extend also to\r\ncandidates.  The facts as adduced will then be a safe guide as to\r\nthe necessity of strengthening the corrupt practices act, or\r\nmore rigorously enforcing existing law, or both.\"\r\n\r\nThe legislative session had hardly concluded before the war with\r\nGermany broke out and it was deemed unwise at that time to\r\nproceed to any agitation on the subject.  The functions of the\r\ncommittee were, accordingly never fulfilled.  Early in the year\r\nof 1920, the Governor gave warning of the report that huge funds\r\nwere to be raised in this year for election purposes.  At the\r\nvery outset of his campaign in addressing the members of\r\nDemocratic National Committee at Columbus, the Governor said:\r\n\r\n\"I hope I do violence to no member of this committee when I\r\nsubmit to you this proposal:  That we purpose not only to deal\r\nwith eminent good faith with the electorate of this nation in\r\nNovember with reference to platform pledges, but we mean to let\r\nevery man and woman understand where every dollar comes from,\r\nand for what purpose it is spent.  We not only urge that as a\r\nmatter of high principle, but in order to guarantee the triumph\r\nof our cause which deserves to triumph.  We do not want the\r\npublication of expenditures after the election.  There is no\r\npoint in advising the voters what has been done.  We want them to\r\nbe fully advised of every circumstance with reference to the\r\ncollection and the disbursement of funds in order that from the\r\ncircumstances they can gain a correct index, and understand that\r\nwhen the Democracy is continued in power in Washington, it\r\nassumes its responsibility without a single obligation except to\r\nthe conscience that God has given us.\r\n\r\n\"Therefore, gentlemen, let us make up a budget which will carry\r\nthe full details and information--recounting the legitimate\r\nexpenses of this campaign, render an accounting daily or weekly,\r\nand the source from which it came.  And more than that, we shall\r\ninsist upon the senatorial investigating committee continuing in\r\nsession until the ballot has been closed in November.  You know\r\nfull well that a campaign fund sufficient in size to stagger the\r\nsensibilities of the nation is now being procured by our\r\nopponents.  If they believe that is correct in principle, God\r\nspeed them in the enterprise, It will be one of our chief assets\r\nin this campaign.\"\r\n\r\nThis, then is the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE LIFE STORY\r\n\r\n\r\nBorn at Jacksonburg, Ohio, March 31, 1870, son of Gilbert and\r\nEliza Cox; educated in public schools; reared on farm; worked in\r\nprinter's office; taught country school; became newspaper\r\nreporter; secretary to Congressman Sorg, 3d Ohio District;\r\nbought Dayton Daily News, 1898, and Springfield Press Republic,\r\n1903, forming News League of Ohio; member 61st and 62d Congress\r\n(1909-13), 3d Ohio District; Governor of Ohio; elected in 1912,\r\ndefeated in 1914, elected in 1916 and 1918; now serving third\r\nterm; home, Trailsend, Dayton.\r\n\r\nThe family of Cox seems to have had its origin in England in the\r\ngenerations gone, but its Americanism is of two centuries in\r\nduration.  At Freeboard, New Jersey, lived General James Cox, one\r\nof the early speakers of the New Jersey House of Representatives\r\nand later a member of Congress.  Tillers of the soil and\r\nartisans, the closer forbears attained to no distinction in\r\npublic life.  To Ohio the family came sometime in the early years\r\nof the last century, and at Jacksonburg the paternal\r\ngrandfather, Gilbert Cox, established himself.  On the ancestral\r\nfarm of 160 acres, his son, Gilbert, Jr., lived, and on it James\r\nM. Cox first saw the light of day.  His uncles and aunts, for his\r\nfather was one of a family of thirteen, were of the people who\r\nmigrated westward.  The youngest of a family of seven children,\r\nhe learned the routine of tasks of a boy on the farm.  In the\r\nlittle one-room country school he attended, his teachers found\r\nhim an ordinary pupil but with a fondness for newspaper reading.\r\n\r\nCox's first public job was the humble position of janitor in the\r\nUnited Brethren Church, and even now his favorite reminiscence\r\nis the difficulty he had in making the old wood stove function\r\nproperly.  The thrifty farmers in those days were accustomed to\r\ncommute part of their dues in cord wood for the church, and\r\noften the quality they supplied was not of the best.  The boy\r\nbecame a member of the Church, a membership which is still\r\nretained.\r\n\r\nAt fifteen he left the elementary school to enter the Middletown\r\nHigh School, living with his sister, Mrs. John Q. Baker, whose\r\nhusband was a teacher in the High School and owner of the\r\nMiddletown Signal.  Board was paid in working as a printer's\r\ndevil until the apprenticeship was served and the county\r\nnewspaper business was mastered from both the counting room and\r\nthe editorial side.  Upon completion of his high school course,\r\nthe young man passed the county examination and obtained a\r\nposition as teacher of the school he had in earlier years\r\nattended, but a pedagogical career was not to his liking and he\r\nreturned to work on the Signal staff.  He became also the local\r\ncorrespondent for the Cincinnati Enquirer and attracted the\r\nattention of the main office by a neat scoop which he landed\r\nregarding a railroad wreck.  Graduating into the reportorial\r\nwork, he became assistant telegraph and railroad editor of the\r\nEnquirer.  He retired from the newspaper life for a time to\r\nbecome Secretary to Congressman Sorg, remaining in his capacity\r\nuntil his 28th year, when he purchased the Dayton News, giving\r\n$12,000 in notes and beginning with a capital of just $80.  The\r\ntimes were hard enough for the young chap with creditors\r\nconstantly upon him.  Once his paper was forced to suspend by\r\nreason of an unpaid bill, and the opposition paper heralded its\r\ndeath.  The struggling publisher retaliated with an \"extra\"\r\nannouncing its continuance.  Then again there were plenty of\r\nlibel suits for the young editor-publisher, setting out to be a\r\nreformer, and the ruling powers in the city strongly disapproved\r\nhis methods, but the militant editor brought readers and the\r\nreaders brought advertisers, and the venture became a success.\r\nFive years from his first venture he bought the Springfield\r\nPress Republic and the Springfield Democrat, combining the two\r\nin the Evening News.  Each is now housed in its own modern\r\nnewspaper building and each is highly prosperous as a business\r\ninstitution, although the owner's supervision has been of a\r\ngeneral character.\r\n\r\nHis associates always speak of the \"Cox luck\" in politics, but\r\nupon analysis it seems that it consists either of seizing or\r\nmaking the opportunity.  In 1908 his Congressional district,\r\noriginally Democratic, had become Republican, but a factional\r\nquarrel breaking out in the opposition camps, the Governor took\r\nthe Democratic nomination and won out, again riding to victory\r\nin the great landslide of 1910.  In Congress his career afforded\r\nhim no opportunity to attain to high distinction, but he became\r\na member of the appropriations committee and there became most\r\ndeeply impressed with the waste in public funds and the\r\nunbusinesslike methods of arriving at appropriations.  One of his\r\nservices was the disclosure that the care of Civil War veterans\r\nin the National Soldiers' Home at Dayton was shattered, and he\r\nwon the contest for increased allowances.  The gratitude of the\r\nveterans was expressed in a majority from the Home in his re-\r\nelection in 1910, thus breaking an historical precedent.\r\n\r\nTwo years later he became the champion of the constitutional\r\namendments proposed by the Fourth Constitutional Convention of\r\nOhio, then sitting, and as such was unanimously nominated by his\r\nparty for Governor, on a platform which demanded a \"new order\"\r\nof things in Ohio.  As soon as he was nominated he took the\r\nplatform before the people for the adoption of the\r\nconstitutional amendments in a special September election.  These\r\namendments included one providing for the initiative and\r\nreferendum of which he had been an advocate for years, and one\r\nfor the removal of officials failing to enforce the laws, giving\r\nthe Governor the weapon with which he established his law-\r\nenforcement record.  There was very little to the campaign in\r\nthat year, the historical Republican party splitting in two upon\r\nthe issue of progressiveness, and he was elected by an enormous\r\nplurality.  Facing the tasks imposed by the new constitution, the\r\nGovernor insisted upon legislative fulfillment of each popular\r\nmandate, and in a busy session of three months he accomplished\r\nhis programme.\r\n\r\nAside from the legislation suggested by the amendments, his\r\ngreatest constructive step was the enactment of a budget system,\r\nwhich sought to place the financial affairs of Ohio upon a\r\nbusinesslike basis.  Its worth as a saver of money and promoter\r\nof efficiency has never been challenged.  The previous Ohio\r\nfiscal system had grown grossly archaic.  Appropriations were\r\nmade by the Legislature to the departments in lump sums or in\r\nthe form of granting all receipts and balances, some of the\r\ndepartments being maintained by the fees from interests they\r\nregulated.  Of the departments having receipts of their own, many\r\nhad deposits of their own in banks and their own checking\r\naccounts, so that their funds never passed through the State\r\nTreasury or through the hands of the State Auditor.  Other\r\ndepartments got much or little from the Legislature, depending\r\nupon whether they had a gifted representative to appear for them\r\nbefore the legislative finance committee.  Institutions vied with\r\neach other in providing the best entertainment to these\r\ncommittees as they made their week-end junket trips over the\r\nState during legislative sessions.\r\n\r\nAll this was changed in one sweeping stroke in the first\r\nadministration of Governor Cox.  All receipts of all departments\r\nnow go into the State Treasury and none leave the treasury until\r\nit is appropriated in specific sums for specific purposes within\r\nspecific departments.  The state auditor has a check on every\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio budget department is composed of one commissioner\r\nappointed by the Governor, an assistant and a clerk.  All\r\ndepartmental requests for funds desired of the next succeeding\r\nLegislature are filed with the Budget Commissioner, to be\r\nbrought before the Governor.  He investigates all items,\r\nascertains the reasons for any increases that are asked, and\r\nfixes the sums he deems proper.  Also, he estimates what the\r\nState revenues during the next biennium will be and prunes the\r\nbudget to come within the total of expected revenues.  The budget\r\nas prepared by the commissioner is submitted to the Governor,\r\nwho frequently makes changes of his own after advising with\r\ndepartment heads.\r\n\r\nThe Governor then presents the budget to the Legislature, which\r\nrefers it to the finance committees of the two houses.  The\r\ncommittees, and, in turn, the Legislature, have full authority\r\nto make any alterations, increases or decreases, desired, but\r\nthe spellbinding by department representatives and wire-pulling\r\nby lobbyists are reduced to a minimum because the Budget\r\nCommissioner sits as the agent of the Governor at all sessions\r\nof the finance committees and at all times is prepared to defend\r\nthe allowance he thinks a department should have.\r\n\r\nThe first budgetary appropriation bill repealed an existing\r\nappropriation law.  It reduced appropriations aggregating\r\n$9,709,288 to $8,762,664, a saving of $946,624.  Since that time\r\nthe Ohio budget system has effected savings of millions, not, of\r\ncourse, in the sense that expenditures of the State government\r\nnow are less than in 1913--for they have increased as\r\ngovernmental activities have enlarged--but in the sense that\r\nexpenditures each year have been vastly less than they would\r\nhave been without the budget plan of pruning and scaling down\r\ndemands of existing State departments with a view both to\r\ngeneral economy and avoidance of deficits.\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Budget and consequently its appropriation law\r\nclassifies expenditures in two divisions: (1) Operating expenses\r\nand (2) Capital outlay (or permanent improvements).\r\n\r\nOperating expenses are subdivided into personal service and\r\nmaintenance.  Personal service in turn is divided into salaries\r\nand wages, and maintenance into supplies, materials, equipment,\r\ncontract or open order service, and fixed charges and\r\ncontributions.\r\n\r\nElasticity of funds within departments is afforded by periodical\r\nmeetings of a board of control, composed of the Governor (who\r\nmay be and usually is represented by the Budget commissioner),\r\nthe State Auditor, the Attorney-General, and the chairmen of the\r\ntwo legislative finance committees.  If any new need develops\r\nwithin departments, funds for the purpose may be provided by a\r\nfour-fifths vote of the board of control.  Effort first is made\r\nto transfer the needed funds from one classification to another\r\nwithin the department.  If no fund within the department has a\r\nsurplus, and the need is great enough, relief may be granted by\r\nthe emergency board, having the same membership as the board of\r\ncontrol, which has at its disposal an emergency fund for\r\ncontingencies arising between legislative sessions.  Perfection\r\nnever has been claimed for the Ohio system.  Governor Cox himself\r\nrealizes certain weaknesses in it and is making a fight now for\r\nstrengthening features, which, however, necessitate a change in\r\nthe constitution.  One defect is that, regardless of probable\r\nincome, the Legislature may increase items in the budget (or\r\nrather the appropriation bill based on the budget), and it may\r\nmake other appropriations in separate bills as it sees fit\r\nwithout regard to prospective revenues.\r\n\r\nIn his 1919 message to the General Assembly, a Republican body,\r\nthe Governor urged submission to the people of an amendment to\r\nthe constitution providing that the Legislature shall have the\r\nright to diminish any item in the executive budget by majority\r\nvote or to strike out any item:  that, however, it shall not be\r\nprivileged to increase any item or to add a new one unless it\r\nmakes legislative provision for sufficient revenue to meet the\r\nadded cost.  Such an amendment was not submitted.  Unless it is\r\ndone by an early legislature, adherents of Cox in Ohio say it\r\nmay be undertaken by initiative petition.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Roads\r\n\r\nAnother notable achievement of Governor Cox is the advance of\r\nthe Ohio highway system.  Roads were in deplorable shape when he\r\nbecame Governor.  There was no hope for rural counties with small\r\ntax duplicates, the ones in greatest need of good roads never\r\nbeing able to lift themselves out of the mud except through\r\nliberal state aid.\r\n\r\nOne of the Governor's first acts was a survey of road\r\nconditions.  A complete network of 10,000 miles of inter-county\r\nroads was mapped out.  It connected the eighty-eight county\r\nseats.  Of the 10,000 miles of inter-county highways, 3000 miles,\r\nconnecting the larger cities, were designated as main market\r\nroads.  The scheme of financing called for improvement of the\r\nmain market roads entirely at state expense, which the remainder\r\nof the system was to be built on a fifty-fifty basis, the state\r\nfurnishing half the funds, and the county in which the road\r\nlies, the other half.\r\n\r\nAll road improvement under the Cox administration has been given\r\nsuch an impetus that the State, county and township programmes\r\nto-day call for an expenditure of $30,000,000 annually,\r\nincluding federal aid.  Popular demand for highway improvement is\r\ngreater than the State Highway department and county\r\ncommissioners are able to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\nRevitalizing the Schools\r\n\r\nAs a pupil in a one-room country school and as a teacher, he had\r\nfirst knowledge of the shortcomings and possibilities of the\r\nOhio educational system.  It was his firm conviction that the\r\ncountry boy and girl should be given the same educational\r\nadvantages that accrued to those of the city.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the Governor's school programme was to give Ohio\r\na co-ordinates system of State, county and district supervision,\r\nto require normal or college training of all teachers, and,\r\nabove all, to pave the way for speedier centralization and\r\nconsolidation of the one-room district school.  Results have been\r\nbeyond the expectations of school men, every breath and\r\nopposition to the system has blown away, and it may truthfully\r\nbe said that it has become an idol of the people of the state.\r\nThe re-organization has stimulated interest in education in all\r\nrespects and has made possible a more recent establishment of a\r\nstate-wide teachers' pensions system and a complete revamping of\r\nfinancial support of schools through a State and county aid\r\nplan.  Salaries of teachers have been increased the last six\r\nyears from a minimum of $40 a month to a statutory minimum of\r\n$800 a school year.  The teacher shortage occasioned by the war\r\nwill be solved without much delay in Ohio, as county and state\r\nnormal schools report prospective increases in attendance of\r\nfifty to one hundred per cent or even greater for next year.\r\n\r\nThe time had come in 1913 when the little district school with\r\nits narrow curriculum and crude methods of instruction did not\r\nmeet the needs and purposes of modern industrial and social life\r\nin Ohio.  It had not kept step with rural economic progress.  In\r\nthe whole State it was the one evidence of retardation, an\r\ninstitution of bygone days which had deteriorated instead of\r\nhaving improved.  The right of every child to educational\r\nopportunities for development to the fullest extent of his\r\npossibilities was not recognized by the State in the school\r\nsystem as it existed at that time.  Governor Cox, in his first\r\nmessage to the general assembly in January, 1913, recommended\r\nthat a complete school survey be made.  A survey commission was\r\ncreated.  To acquaint school patrons with the object of the\r\nsurvey in progress and to get them to discuss in their own\r\ncommunities the defects and the needs of the schools, November\r\n14, 1913, was set apart as \"School survey day\" and a light\r\nburned in every school building in the State that night.\r\nDelegates were appointed to attend a state-wide educational\r\ncongress the next month, and in January, 1914, the Governor\r\ncalled a special session to enact the rural school code.\r\n\r\nThe survey report disclosed that not half of the teachers of the\r\nState ever had attended high school, nor had normal training.\r\nRural schools were mere stepping stones for young teachers\r\nbefore securing positions in village and city schools,\r\nagriculture was scarcely taught, schools were without equipment,\r\nthree-fourths of the buildings were twenty years old or older,\r\nunsanitary, poorly lighted, without ventilation and\r\ninsufficiently heated.\r\n\r\nWith one stroke the new school code created county supervision\r\ndistricts under the control of county boards, elected by the\r\npresidents of village and township boards; provided for county\r\nsuperintendents and supervisors over smaller districts within\r\nthe county; required academic and professional training of all\r\nnew teachers henceforth, and gave communities wider powers to\r\ncentralize and consolidate schools.\r\n\r\nAt present ninety-five per cent of the elementary teachers have\r\nhad professional training, and high school teachers are required\r\nto be college graduates or have equivalent scholastic\r\nattainment.  The most common faults of class-room instruction\r\nhave been to a great extent eliminated.  Standard methods of\r\npresentation are being practices in an attempt to give to each\r\nchild opportunity for development of his possibilities.\r\n\r\nA great stimulation of public school sentiment is manifested by\r\na closer co-operation and correlation of the school and the\r\nhome, resulting in boys' and girls' club work, achievement\r\ncourses, home projects and other school extension and community\r\nactivities; a growth of the feeling of responsibility to the\r\ncommunity on the part of the teacher; an attitude of greater\r\ninterest and responsibility of the boards of education toward\r\nthe school; a willingness of the people to vote money for new\r\nschool plants and enterprises; a growing demand for\r\nconsolidation and centralization; a better trained class of\r\nteachers, increased school attendance, especially in high\r\nschools where it has increased from fifty to one hundred per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nSchool administration is much more efficient as is demonstrated\r\nby a uniform course of study for elementary and high schools,\r\nvitalized by its articulation with the industrial activities of\r\nthe community, county uniformity of textbooks, selection and\r\ncorrelation of textbook material and its adaptation to the\r\nvarying interests and needs of childhood, uniform system of\r\nreports and records, and the like.\r\n\r\nSchool centers have been made to coincide with social and\r\nbusiness centers.  Convenient districts have been formed around\r\ncenters of population. village and surrounding rural districts\r\nhave been united in accordance with the trend of the community\r\ninterests and activities.  Weak districts have been eliminated by\r\nthe transfer of their territory to other districts, thereby\r\nstrengthening property valuations.\r\n\r\nA centralized school in Ohio was almost a novelty in 1914.  A\r\nyear ago there were 310 centralized (township) schools and 599\r\nconsolidated (embracing several contiguous districts) schools,\r\nand the number has been materially swelled during the year.\r\nSeventy of the eighty-eight counties now have such schools and\r\nthe trend is toward them throughout the State.  One such school\r\nreplaces, on the average, eight one-room schools.  They have\r\nbrought to the rural pupils trained teachers, well-equipped\r\nbuildings, courses of study related to the interests of the farm\r\nand home by being well-balanced between the cultural and\r\nvocational.  They have made it possible for the country boy who\r\nremains on the farm to obtain a high school education in his own\r\ncommunity that is directly related to his needs.  Scientific\r\nagriculture under trained instructors is taught in all of these\r\nschools.  The possibilities of the farm and of rural life are\r\nthus revealed to the boy and he will be equipped with knowledge\r\nnecessary to the scientific performance of his work.  From the\r\nfarm instead of the law office and the counting room will come\r\nthose who know what the needs and interests of the farmer are\r\nand who will be qualified to represent those interests.\r\n\r\nWhile the system still may be said to be in its infancy, the\r\nprogress of transformation of Ohio schools under it has been\r\nnothing short of wonderful, and unending results may be expected\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nThis extensive legislation had aroused many prejudices\r\nparticularly, in the rural sections, of which his opponent,\r\nCongressman Frank B. Willis, took advantage.  The bold challenge\r\nof the Governor to his opponent was stated by him on the\r\nplatform in many parts of Ohio \"Which law will you repeal?\"  The\r\nquestion was never answered, but the tide of opposition to the\r\nchanges swept Governor Cox out of office, although he ran many\r\nthousands ahead of his associates.  In the succeeding sessions of\r\nthe General Assembly popular sentiment began once more to swing\r\nto Governor Cox and two years later he was re-elected by a small\r\nplurality.  Improvement in the various laws was sought during his\r\nnext term, but the shadow of the world war was already beginning\r\nto fall, and the greater part of his efforts were devoted to\r\npreparation for Ohio's part.\r\n\r\nIn general administration the Governor's supporters are fond of\r\nsaying that he met successfully\r\n\r\n      In his first term a flood,\r\n      In his second term a war,\r\n      In his third term reconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe flood story was the one that really introduced him first to\r\nthe country at large.  Ohio was hit by a calamity greater than\r\nany that had befallen a state.  Columbus, Dayton, Marietta,\r\nHamilton and other cities were under water for days, many\r\nvillages were almost washed off the map, and hundreds of lives\r\nand untold millions of property were lost.  Bridges everywhere\r\nwere washed out and transportation was practically at a\r\nstandstill.  The eyes of the State and Country were on the then\r\nuntried Governor Cox.  He met the situation in a manner that will\r\nnever be forgotten in Ohio.  The Ohio National Guard was called\r\nout, stricken communities were placed under martial law,\r\ncivilian relief armies under the command of mayors and other\r\ndesignated leaders organized everywhere, Ohio's motor truck,\r\nautomobile and other facilities commandeered, and the work of\r\nfeeding, clothing, cleaning up and rehabilitation carried on\r\nfrom the beginning with astounding efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe New York World at that time said of him:\r\n\r\n\"The man who has dominated the situation in Ohio is Governor\r\nCox.  He has been not only chief magistrate and commander-in-\r\nchief, but the head of the life-saving service, the greatest\r\nprovider of food and clothing the State has ever known, the\r\nprincipal health officer, the sanest counselor, the severest\r\ndisciplinarian, the kindest philanthropist and best reporter.  He\r\nhas performed incredible labors in all these fields, and his\r\nilluminating dispatches to the World at the close of the heart-\r\nbreaking days have given a clearer vision of conditions than\r\ncould be had from any other source.  Reared on a farm, educated\r\nin the public schools, a printer by trade, a successful\r\npublisher and editor of newspapers, a great Governor and a\r\nreported who gets his story into the first edition, James M. Cox\r\nexcites and is herewith offered assurance of the World's most\r\ndistinguished consideration.\"\r\n\r\nThe flood revealed the necessity for conservancy legislation and\r\nthe measure recommended by the Governor was enacted to give\r\nlocal communities the right to protect themselves.\r\n\r\nThe time has gone by when in Ohio the major things in the\r\nprogramme of Governor Cox can be attacked successfully before\r\nthe people of the State.  He does not claim perfection.\r\nSuggestion as to improvement has found him ready to listen.\r\nThere is still a short time for him to serve, but the public\r\njudgment has been made up, and Buckeye citizens, without regard\r\nto party affiliation, says that he has been a \"good Governor.\"",
