S. DOWN TO THE TIME OF HIS\r\nDEATH.\r\n\r\n1790-1826.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, June 28, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I should have taken time ere this to have considered the\r\nobservations of Mr. Young, could I at this place have done it in such\r\na way as would satisfy either him or myself. When I wrote the notes of\r\nthe last year, I had never before thought of calculating what were the\r\nprofits of a capital invested in Virginia agriculture. Yet that appeared\r\nto be what Mr. Young most desired. Lest therefore no other of those,\r\nwhom you consulted for him, should attempt such a calculation, I did\r\nit; but being at such a distance from the country of which I wrote, and\r\nhaving been absent from that and from the subject in consideration many\r\nyears, I could only, for my facts, recur to my own recollection, weakened\r\nby time and very different applications, and I had no means here of\r\ncorrecting my facts. I therefore hazarded the calculation rather as an\r\nessay of the mode of calculating the profits of a Virginia estate, than\r\nas an operation which was to be ultimately relied on. When I went last\r\nto Virginia I put the press-copy of those notes into the hands of the\r\nmost skilful and successful farmer in the part of the country of which\r\nI wrote. He omitted to return them to me, which adds another impediment\r\nto my resuming the subject here; but indeed if I had them, I could only\r\npresent the same facts, with some corrections and some justifications of\r\nthe principles of calculation. This would not and ought not to satisfy Mr.\r\nYoung. When I return home I shall have time and opportunity of answering\r\nMr. Young's enquiries fully. I will first establish the facts as adapted\r\nto the present times, and not to those to which I was obliged to recur by\r\nrecollection, and I will make the calculation on rigorous principles. The\r\ndelay necessary for this will I hope be compensated by giving something\r\nwhich no endeavors on my part shall be wanting to make it worthy of\r\nconfidence. In the meantime Mr. Young must not pronounce too hastily on\r\nthe impossibility of an annual production of £750 worth of wheat coupled\r\nwith a cattle product of £125. My object was to state the produce of\r\na _good_ farm, under _good_ husbandry as practised in my part of the\r\ncountry. Manure does not enter into this, because we can buy an acre of\r\nnew land cheaper than we can manure an old acre. Good husbandry with us\r\nconsists in abandoning Indian corn and tobacco, tending small grain, some\r\nred clover, following, and endeavoring to have, while the lands are at\r\nrest, a spontaneous cover of white clover. I do not present this as a\r\nculture judicious in itself, but as _good_ in comparison with what most\r\npeople there pursue. Mr. Young has never had an opportunity of seeing how\r\nslowly the fertility of the _original soil_ is exhausted. With moderate\r\nmanagement of it, I can affirm that the James river lowgrounds with the\r\ncultivation of small grain, will never be exhausted: because we know that\r\nunder that cultivation we must now and then take them down with Indian\r\ncorn, or they become, as they were originally, too rich to bring wheat.\r\nThe highlands, where I live, have been cultivated about sixty years. The\r\nculture was tobacco and Indian corn as long as they would bring enough\r\nto pay the labor. Then they were turned out. After four or five years\r\nrest they would bring good corn again, and in double that time perhaps\r\ngood tobacco. Then they would be exhausted by a second series of tobacco\r\nand corn. Latterly we have begun to cultivate small grain; and excluding\r\nIndian corn, and following, such of them as were originally good, soon\r\nrise up to fifteen or twenty bushels the acre. We allow that every laborer\r\nwill manage ten acres of wheat, except at harvest. I have no doubt but\r\nthe coupling cattle and sheep with this would prodigiously improve the\r\nproduce. This improvement Mr. Young will be better able to calculate than\r\nanybody else. I am so well satisfied of it myself, that having engaged a\r\ngood farmer from the head of Elk, (the style of farming there you know\r\nwell,) I mean in a farm of about 500 acres of cleared land and with a\r\ndozen laborers to try the plan of wheat, rye, potatoes, clover, with a\r\nmixture of some Indian corn with the potatoes, and to push the number\r\nof sheep. This last hint I have taken from Mr. Young's letters which you\r\nhave been so kind as to communicate to me. I have never before considered\r\nwith due attention the profit from that animal. I shall not be able to put\r\nthe farm into that form exactly the ensuing autumn, but against another\r\nI hope I shall, and I shall attend with precision to the measures of the\r\nground and of the product, which may perhaps give you something hereafter\r\nto communicate to Mr. Young which may gratify him, but I will furnish the\r\nensuing winter what was desired in Mr. Young's letter of Jan. 17, 1793. I\r\nhave the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. GILMER.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, June 25, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR,--* * * * * Dumourier was known to be a scoundrel in grain.\r\nI mentioned this from the beginning of his being placed at the head\r\nof the armies; but his victories at length silenced me. His apostasy\r\nhas now proved that an unprincipled man, let his other fitnesses be\r\nwhat they will, ought never to be employed. It has proved too that the\r\nFrench army, as well as nation, cannot be shaken in their republicanism.\r\nDumourier's popularity put it to as severe a proof as could be offered.\r\nTheir steadiness to their principles insures the issue of their revolution\r\nagainst every effort but by the way of famine. Should that take place the\r\neffect would be incalculable; because our machine, unsupported by food, is\r\nno longer under the control of reason. This crisis, however, is now nearly\r\nover, as their harvest is by this time beginning. As far as the last\r\naccounts come down, they were retiring to within their own limits; where\r\ntheir assignats would do for money, (except at Mentz,) England too is\r\nissuing her paper, not founded like the assignats, on land, but on pawns\r\nof thread, ribbons, &c. They will soon learn the science of depreciation,\r\nand their whole paper system vanish into nothing, on which it is bottomed.\r\nMy affectionate respects to Mrs. Gilmer, and am, dear Doctor, yours,\r\nsincerely.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, June 28, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge your favor of May 28. I believe that\r\nthrough all America there has been but a single sentiment on the subject\r\nof peace and war, which was in favor of the former. The Executive here\r\nhas cherished it with equal and unanimous desire. We have differed\r\nperhaps as to the conduct exactly adapted to the securing it. We have as\r\nyet no indirections of the intentions or even the wishes of the British\r\ngovernment. I rather believe they mean to hold themselves up, and be led\r\nby events. In the meanwhile Spain is so evidently _picking a quarrel_\r\nwith us, that we see a war absolutely inevitable with her. We are making\r\na last effort to avoid it, but our cabinet is without any decision\r\nin their expectations of the result. This may not be known before the\r\nlast of October, earlier than which I think you will meet. You should\r\ntherefore calculate your domestic measures on this change of position.\r\nIf France collected within her own limits shall maintain her ground there\r\nsteadily, as I think she will, (barring the effect of famine which no one\r\ncan calculate,) and if the bankruptcies of England proceed to the length\r\nof an universal crush of their paper, which I also think they will, she\r\nwill leave Spain the bag to hold; she is emitting assignats also, that\r\nis to say exchequer bills, to the amount of five millions English, or\r\none hundred and twenty-five millions French; and these are not founded\r\non land as the French assignats are, but on pins, thread, buckles, hops,\r\nand whatever else you will pawn in the exchequer of double the estimated\r\nvalue. But we all know that five millions of such stuff forced for sale\r\non the market of London, where there will be neither cash nor credit, will\r\nnot pay storage. This paper must rest then ultimately on the credit of the\r\nnation as the rest of their public paper does, and will sink with that.\r\nIf either this takes place, or the confederacy is unsuccessful, we may be\r\nclear of war with England. With respect to the increase of our shipping,\r\nour merchants have no need, you know, of a permission to buy up foreign\r\nbottoms. There is no law prohibiting it, and when bought they are American\r\nproperty, and as such entitled to pass freely by our treaties with some\r\nnations, and by the law of nations with all. Such accordingly, by a\r\ndetermination of the Executive, will receive American passports. They will\r\nnot be entitled indeed to import goods on the low duties of _home-built_\r\nvessels, the laws having confined that privilege to these only. We have\r\ntaken every possible method to guard against fraudulent conveyances,\r\nwhich, if we can augment our shipping to the extent of our own carriage,\r\nit would not be our interest to cover. I enclose you a note from Freneau,\r\nexplaining the interruption of your papers. I do not augur well of the\r\nmode of conduct of the new French minister; I fear he will enlarge the\r\nevils of those disaffected to his country. I am doing everything in my\r\npower to moderate the impetuosity of his movements, and to destroy the\r\ndangerous opinions which has been excited in him, that the people of the\r\nUnited States will disavow the acts of their government, and that he has\r\nan appeal from the Executive to Congress, and from both to the people.\r\nAffairs with the Creeks seem to present war there as inevitable, but\r\nthat will await for you. We have no news from the northern commissioners,\r\nbut of the delay likely to be attempted by the Indians; but as we never\r\nexpected peace from the negotiation, I think no delay will be admitted\r\nwhich may defeat our preparations for a campaign. Crops here are likely\r\nto be good, though the beginning of the harvest has been a little wet. I\r\nforgot whether I informed you that I had chosen a house for you, and was\r\ndetermined in the choice by the southern aspect of the back buildings, the\r\nonly circumstance of difference between the two presented to my choice.\r\nGive my best love to Mrs. Monroe, and be assured of the affectionate\r\nesteem of, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                             June 29, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I wrote you on the 23d, and yesterday I received yours of the 17th,\r\nwhich was the more welcome as it acknowledged mine of the 9th, about the\r\nsafety of which I was anxious. I now risk some other papers, the sequel of\r\nthose conveyed in that. The result I know not. We are sending a courier to\r\nMadrid to make a last effort for the preservation of honorable peace. The\r\naffairs of France are recovering their solidity, and from the steadiness\r\nof the people on the defection of so popular and capital a commander as\r\nDumourier, we have a proof that nothing can shake this republicanism.\r\nHunger is to be expected; but the silence of the late papers on that\r\nhead, and the near approach of harvest, makes us hope they will weather\r\nthat rock. I do not find that there has been serious insurrection but in\r\nBrittany, and where the noblesse having been as numerous as the people,\r\nand indeed being almost the people, the counter-revolutionary spirit has\r\nbeen known always to have existed since the night in which titles were\r\nsuppressed. The English are trying to stop the torrent of bankruptcies\r\nby an emission of five millions of exchequer bills, loaned on the\r\npawn-broking plan, consequently much inferior to the assignats in value.\r\nBut that paper will sink to an immediate level with their other public\r\npaper, and consequently can only complete the ruin of those who take it\r\nfrom government at par, and on a pledge of pins, buckles, &c., of little\r\nvalue, which will not sell so as to pay storage in a country where there\r\nis no specie, and we may say no paper of confidence. Every letter which\r\ncomes expresses a firm belief that the whole paper system will now vanish\r\ninto that nothing on which it is bottomed. For even the public faith is\r\nnothing as the mass of paper bottomed on it is known to be beyond its\r\npossible redemption. I hope this will be a wholesome lesson to our future\r\nLegislature. The war between France and England has brought forward the\r\nRepublicans and Monocrats in every State, so that their relative numbers\r\nare perfectably visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. CARMICHAEL AND SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, June 30, 1793.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I have received from Messrs. Viar and Jaudenes the\r\nrepresentatives of Spain at this place, a letter, which, whether\r\nconsidered in itself, or as the sequel of several others, conveys to us\r\nvery disagreeable prospects of the temper and views of their court towards\r\nus. If this letter is a faithful expression of that temper, we presume\r\nit to be the effect of egregious misrepresentations by their agents in\r\nAmerica. Revising our own dispositions and proceedings towards that power,\r\nwe can find in them nothing but those of peace and friendship for them;\r\nand conscious that this will be apparent from a true statement of facts,\r\nI shall proceed to give you such a one, to be communicated to the court\r\nof Madrid. If they find it very different from that conveyed to them by\r\nothers, they may think it prudent to doubt, and to take and to give time\r\nfor mutual inquiry and explanation. I shall proceed to give you this\r\nstatement, beginning it from an early period.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the late war, the United States laid it down\r\nas a rule of their conduct, to engage the Indian tribes within their\r\nneighborhood to remain strictly neutral. They accordingly strongly\r\npressed it on them, urging that it was a family quarrel with which they\r\nhad nothing to do, and in which we wished them to take no part; and we\r\nstrengthened these recommendations by doing them every act of friendship\r\nand good neighborhood, which circumstances left in our power. With some,\r\nthese solicitations prevailed; but the greater part of them suffered\r\nthemselves to be drawn into the war against us. They waged it in their\r\nusual cruel manner, murdering and scalping men, women and children,\r\nindiscriminately, burning their houses, and desolating the country. They\r\nput us to vast expense, as well by the constant force we were obliged to\r\nkeep up in that quarter, as by the expeditions of considerable magnitude\r\nwhich we were under the necessity of sending into their country from time\r\nto time.\r\n\r\nPeace being at length concluded with England, we had it also to conclude\r\nwith them. They had made war on us without the least provocation or\r\npretence of injury. They had added greatly to the cost of that war. They\r\nhad insulted our feelings by their savage cruelties. They were by our\r\narms completely subdued and humbled. Under all these circumstances, we\r\nhad a right to demand substantial satisfaction and indemnification. We\r\nused that right, however, with real moderation. Their limits with us under\r\nthe former government were generally ill defined, questionable, and the\r\nfrequent cause of war. Sincerely desirous of living in their peace, of\r\ncultivating it by every act of justice and friendship, and of rendering\r\nthem better neighbors by introducing among them some of the most useful\r\narts, it was necessary to begin by a precise definition of boundary.\r\nAccordingly, at the treaties held with them, our mutual boundaries were\r\nsettled; and notwithstanding our just right to concessions adequate to the\r\ncircumstances of the case, we required such only as were inconsiderable;\r\nand for even these, in order that we might place them in a state of\r\nperfect conciliation, we paid them a valuable consideration, and granted\r\nthem annuities in money which have been regularly paid, and were equal to\r\nthe prices for which they have usually sold their lands.\r\n\r\nSensible, as they were, of the wrong they had done, they expected to make\r\nsome indemnification, and were, for the most part, satisfied with the mode\r\nand measure of it. In one or two instances, where a dissatisfaction was\r\nobserved to remain as to the boundaries agreed on, or doubts entertained\r\nof the authority of those with whom they were agreed, the United States\r\ninvited the parties to new treaties, and rectified what appeared to be\r\nsusceptible of it. This was particularly the case with the Creeks. They\r\ncomplained of an inconvenient cession of lands on their part, and by\r\npersons not duly representing their nation. They were therefore desired\r\nto appoint a proper deputation to revise their treaty; and that there\r\nmight be no danger of any unfair practices, they were invited to come\r\nto the seat of the General Government, and to treat with that directly.\r\nThey accordingly came. A considerable proportion of what had been ceded,\r\nwas, on the revision, yielded back to them, and nothing required in\r\nlieu of it; and though they would have been better satisfied to have had\r\nthe whole restored, yet they had obtained enough to satisfy them well.\r\nTheir nation, too, would have been satisfied, for they were conscious\r\nof their aggression, and of the moderation of the indemnity with which\r\nwe had been contented. But at that time came among them an adventurer\r\nof the name of Bowles, who, acting from an impulse with which we are\r\nunacquainted, flattered them with the hope of some foreign interference,\r\nwhich should undo what had been done, and force us to consider the naked\r\ngrant of their peace as a sufficient satisfaction for their having made\r\nwar on us. Of this adventurer the Spanish government rid us; but not\r\nof his principles, his practices, and his excitements against us. These\r\nwere more than continued by the officers commanding at New Orleans and\r\nPensacola, and by agents employed by them, and bearing their commission.\r\nTheir proceedings have been the subject of former letters to you, and\r\nproofs of these proceedings have been sent to you. Those, with others now\r\nsent, establish the facts, that they called assemblies of the southern\r\nIndians, openly persuaded them to disavow their treaties, and the limits\r\ntherein established, promised to support them with all the powers which\r\ndepended on them, assured them of the protection of their sovereign,\r\ngave them arms in great quantities for the avowed purpose of committing\r\nhostilities on us, and promised them future supplies to their utmost\r\nneed. The Chickasaws, the most steady and faithful friends of these\r\nStates, have remained unshaken by these practices. So also have the\r\nChocktaws, for the most part. The Cherokees have been teased into some\r\nexpressions of discontent, delivered only to the Spanish Governors, or\r\ntheir agents; while to us they have continued to speak the language of\r\npeace and friendship. One part of the nation only, settled at Cuckamogga\r\nand mixed with banditti and outcasts from the Shawanese and other\r\ntribes, acknowledging control from none, and never in a state of peace,\r\nhave readily engaged in the hostilities against us to which they were\r\nencouraged. But what was much more important, great numbers of the Creeks,\r\nchiefly their young men, have yielded to these incitements, and have\r\nnow, for more than a twelvemonth, been committing murders and desolations\r\non our frontiers. Really desirous of living in peace with them, we have\r\nredoubled our efforts to produce the same disposition in them. We have\r\nborne with their aggressions, forbidden all returns of hostility against\r\nthem, tied up the hands of our people, insomuch that few instances of\r\nretaliation have occurred even from our suffering citizens; we have\r\nmultiplied our gratifications to them, fed them when starving, from the\r\nproduce of our own fields and labor. No longer ago than the last winter,\r\nwhen they had no other resource against famine, and must have perished in\r\ngreat numbers, we carried into their country and distributed among them,\r\ngratuitously, ten thousand bushels of corn; and that too, at the same\r\ntime, when their young men were daily committing murders on helpless women\r\nand children on our frontiers. And though these depredations now involve\r\nmore considerable parts of the nation, we are still demanding punishment\r\nof the guilty individuals, and shall be contented with it. These acts\r\nof neighborly kindness and support on our part have not been confined\r\nto the Creeks, though extended to them in much the greatest degree. Like\r\nwants among the Chickasaws had induced us to send to them also, at first,\r\nfive hundred bushels of corn, and afterwards, fifteen hundred more. Our\r\nlanguage to all the tribes of Indians has constantly been, to live in\r\npeace with one another, and in a most especial manner, we have used our\r\nendeavors with those in the neighborhood of the Spanish colonies, to be\r\npeaceable towards those colonies. I sent you on a former occasion the copy\r\nof a letter from the Secretary of War to Mr. Seagrove, one of our agents\r\nwith the Indians in that quarter, merely to convey to you the general\r\ntenor of the conduct marked out for those agents; and I desired you, in\r\nplacing before the eyes of the Spanish ministry the very contrary conduct\r\nobserved by their agents here, to invite them to a reciprocity of good\r\noffices with our Indian neighbors, each for the other, and to make our\r\ncommon peace the common object of both nations. I can protest that such\r\nhave hitherto been the candid and zealous endeavors of this government,\r\nand that if its agents have in any instance acted in another way, it has\r\nbeen equally unknown and unauthorized by us, and that were even probable\r\nproofs of it produced, there would be no hesitation to mark them with\r\nthe disapprobation of the government. We expected the same friendly\r\ncondescension from the court of Spain, in furnishing you with proofs of\r\nthe practices of the Governor de Carondelet in particular practices avowed\r\nby him, and attempted to be justified in his letter.\r\n\r\nIn this state of things, in such dispositions towards Spain and towards\r\nthe Indians, in such a course of proceedings with respect to them, and\r\nwhile negotiations were instituted at Madrid for arranging these and all\r\nother matters which might affect our friendship and good understanding, we\r\nreceived from Messrs. de Viar and Jaudenes their letter of May the 25th,\r\nwhich was the subject of mine of May the 31st to you; and now again we\r\nhave received that of the 18th instant, a copy of which is enclosed. This\r\nletter charges us, and in the most disrespectful style, with\r\n\r\n1. Exciting the Chickasaws to war on the Creeks.\r\n\r\n2. Furnishing them with provisions and arms.\r\n\r\n3. Aiming at the occupation of a post at the Ecores amargas.\r\n\r\n4. Giving medals and marks of distinction to several Indians.\r\n\r\n5. Meddling with the affairs of such as are allies of Spain.\r\n\r\n6. Not using efficacious means to prevent these proceedings.\r\n\r\nI shall make short observations on these charges.\r\n\r\n1. Were the first true, it would not be unjustifiable. The Creeks have\r\nnow a second time commenced against us a wanton and unprovoked war, and\r\nthe present one in the face of a recent treaty, and of the most friendly\r\nand charitable offices on our part. There would be nothing out of the\r\ncommon course of proceeding then, for us to engage allies, if we needed\r\nany, for their punishment. But we neither need, nor have sought them. The\r\nfact itself is utterly false, and we defy the world to produce a single\r\nproof of it. The declaration of war by the Chickasaws, as we are informed,\r\nwas a very sudden thing, produced by the murder of some of their people\r\nby a party of Creeks, and produced so instantaneously as to give nobody\r\ntime to interfere, either to promote or prevent a rupture. We had, on\r\nthe contrary, most particularly exhorted that nation to preserve peace,\r\nbecause in truth we have a most particular friendship for them. This will\r\nbe evident from a copy of the message of the President to them, among the\r\npapers now enclosed.\r\n\r\n2. The gift of provisions was but an act of that friendship to them,\r\nwhen in the same distress, which had induced us to give five times as\r\nmuch to the less friendly nation of the Creeks. But we have given arms\r\nto them. We believe it is the practice of every white nation to give arms\r\nto the neighboring Indians. The agents of Spain have done it abundantly,\r\nand, we suppose, not out of their own pockets, and this for purposes\r\nof avowed hostility on us; and they have been liberal in promises of\r\nfurther supplies. We have given a few arms to a very friendly tribe, not\r\nto make war on Spain, but to defend themselves from the atrocities of\r\na vastly more numerous and powerful people, and one which, by a series\r\nof unprovoked and even unrepelled attacks on us, is obliging us to look\r\ntowards war as the only means left of curbing their insolence.\r\n\r\n3. We are aiming, as is pretended, at an establishment on the Mississippi,\r\nat the Ecores amargas. Considering the measures of this nature with which\r\nSpain is going on, having, since the proposition to treat with us on\r\nthe subject, established posts at the Walnut hills and other places for\r\ntwo hundred miles upwards, it would not have been wonderful if we had\r\ntaken countervailing measures. But the truth is, we have not done it. We\r\nwished to give a fair chance to the negotiation going on, and thought it\r\nbut common candor to leave things in _statu quo_, to make no innovation\r\npending the negotiation. In this spirit we forbid, and deterred even by\r\nmilitary force, a large association of our citizens, under the name of\r\nthe Yazoo companies, which had formed to settle themselves at those very\r\nWalnut hills, which Spain has since occupied. And so far are we from\r\nmeditating the particular establishment so boldly charged in this letter,\r\nthat we know not what place is meant by the Ecores amargas. This charge\r\nthen is false also.\r\n\r\n4. Giving medals and marks of distinction to the Indian chiefs. This is\r\nbut blindly hinted at in this letter, but was more pointedly complained of\r\nin the former. This has been an ancient custom from time immemorial. The\r\nmedals are considered as complimentary things, as marks of friendship to\r\nthose who come to see us, or who do us good offices, conciliatory of their\r\ngood will towards us, and not designed to produce a contrary disposition\r\ntowards others. They confer no power, and seem to have taken their origin\r\nin the European practice, of giving medals or other marks of friendship to\r\nthe negotiators of treaties and other diplomatic characters, or visitors\r\nof distinction. The British government, while it prevailed here, practised\r\nthe giving medals, gorgets, and bracelets to the savages, invariably. We\r\nhave continued it, and we did imagine, without pretending to know, that\r\nSpain also did it.\r\n\r\n5. We meddle with the affairs of Indians in alliance with Spain. We are\r\nperfectly at a loss to know what this means. The Indians on our frontier\r\nhave treaties both with Spain and us. We have endeavored to cultivate\r\ntheir friendship, to merit it by presents, charities, and exhortations to\r\npeace with their neighbors, and particularly with the subjects of Spain.\r\nWe have carried on some little commerce with them, merely to supply their\r\nwants. Spain too has made them presents, traded with them, kept agents\r\namong them, though their country is within the limits established as ours\r\nat the general peace. However, Spain has chosen to have it understood that\r\nshe has some claim to some parts of that country, and that it must be\r\none of the subjects of our present negotiations. Out of respect for her\r\nthen, we have considered her pretensions to the country, though it was\r\nimpossible to believe them serious, as coloring pretensions to a concern\r\nwith those Indians on the same ground with our own, and we were willing to\r\nlet them go on till a treaty should set things to right between us.\r\n\r\n6. Another article of complaint is, that we have not used efficacious\r\nmeans to suppress these practices. But if the charge is false, or the\r\npractice justifiable, no suppression is necessary.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, these gentlemen say that on a view of these proceedings of the\r\nUnited States with respect to Spain and the Indians, their allies, they\r\nforesee that our peace with Spain is very problematical in future. The\r\nprincipal object of the letter being _our_ supposed excitements of the\r\nChickasaws against the Creeks and _their_ protection of the latter, are\r\nwe to understand from this that if we arm to repulse the attacks of the\r\nCreeks on ourselves it will disturb our peace with Spain? That if we will\r\nnot fold our arms and let them butcher us without resistance, Spain will\r\nconsider it as a cause of war? This is, indeed, so serious an intimation,\r\nthat the President has thought it could no longer be treated with\r\nsubordinate characters, but that his sentiments should be conveyed to the\r\ngovernment of Spain itself, through you.\r\n\r\nWe love and we value peace; we know its blessings from experience. We\r\nabhor the follies of war, and are not untried in its distresses and\r\ncalamities. Unmeddling with the affairs of other nations, we had hoped\r\nthat our distance and our dispositions would have left us free, in the\r\nexample and indulgence of peace with all the world. We had, with sincere\r\nand particular dispositions, courted and cultivated the friendship of\r\nSpain. We have made to it great sacrifices of time and interest, and\r\nwere disposed to believe she would see her interests also in a perfect\r\ncoalition and good understanding with us. Cherishing still the same\r\nsentiments, we have chosen, in the present instance, to ascribe the\r\nintimations in this letter to the particular character of the writers,\r\ndisplayed in the peculiarity of the style of their communications, and\r\ntherefore, we have removed the cause from them to their sovereign, in\r\nwhose justice and love of peace we have confidence. If we are disappointed\r\nin this appeal, if we are to be forced into a contrary order of things,\r\nour mind is made up. We shall meet it with firmness. The necessity of our\r\nposition will supersede all appeal to calculation now, as it has done\r\nheretofore. We confide in our own strength, without boasting of it; we\r\nrespect that of others, without fearing it. If we cannot otherwise prevail\r\non the Creeks to discontinue their depredations, we will attack them in\r\nforce. If Spain chooses to consider our defence against savage butchery\r\nas a cause of war to her, we must meet her also in war, with regret, but\r\nwithout fear; and we shall be happier, to the last moment, to repair with\r\nher to the tribunal of peace and reason.\r\n\r\nThe President charges you to communicate the contents of this letter\r\nto the court of Madrid, with all the temperance and delicacy which the\r\ndignity and character of that court render proper; but with all the\r\nfirmness and self-respect which befit a nation conscious of its rectitude,\r\nand settled in its purpose.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and\r\nrespect, Gentlemen, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, July 14, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of June 27th, has been duly received. You have\r\nmost perfectly seized the _original_ idea of the proclamation. When first\r\nproposed as a declaration of neutrality, it was opposed, first, because\r\nthe Executive had no power to declare neutrality. Second, as such a\r\ndeclaration would be premature, and would lose us the benefit for which\r\nit might be bartered. It was urged that there was a strong impression\r\nin the minds of many that they were free to join in the hostilities on\r\nthe side of France, others were unapprised of the danger they would be\r\nexposed to in carrying contraband goods, &c. It was therefore agreed that\r\na proclamation should issue, declaring that we were in a state of peace,\r\nadmonishing the people to do nothing contravening it, and putting them on\r\ntheir guard as to contraband. On this ground it was accepted or acquiesced\r\nin by all, and E. R., who drew it, brought it to me, the draught, to\r\nlet me see there was no such word as _neutrality_ in it. Circumstances\r\nforbid other verbal criticisms. The public, however, soon took it up as\r\na declaration of neutrality, and it came to be considered at length as\r\nsuch. The arming privateers in Charleston, with our means entirely, and\r\npartly our citizens, was complained of in a memorial from Mr. Hammond.\r\nIn our consultation it was agreed we were by treaty _bound_ to prohibit\r\nthe enemies of France from arming in our ports, and were free to prohibit\r\nFrance also, and that by the laws of neutrality we are bound to permit or\r\nforbid the same things to both, as far as our treaties would permit. All,\r\ntherefore, were forbidden to arm within our ports, and the vessels armed\r\nbefore the prohibition were on the advice of a majority ordered to leave\r\nour ports. With respect to our citizens who had joined in hostilities\r\nagainst a nation with whom we are at peace, the subject was thus viewed.\r\nTreaties are law. By the treaty with England we are in a state of peace\r\nwith her. He who breaks that peace, if within our jurisdiction, breaks\r\nthe laws, and is punishable by them. And if he is punishable he ought to\r\nbe punished, because no citizen should be free to commit his country to\r\nwar. Some vessels were taken within our bays. There, foreigners as well\r\nas natives are liable to punishment. Some were committed in the high\r\nseas. There, as the sea is a common jurisdiction to all nations, and\r\ndivided _by persons_, each having a right to the jurisdiction over their\r\nown citizens only, our citizens only were punishable by us. But they\r\nwere so, because within our jurisdiction. Had they gone into a _foreign\r\nland_ and committed a hostility, they would have been clearly out of\r\nour jurisdiction and unpunishable by the existing laws. As the armament\r\nin Charleston had taken place before our citizens might have reflected\r\non the case, only two were prosecuted, merely to satisfy the complaint\r\nmade, and to serve as a warning to others. But others having attempted\r\nto arm another vessel in New York after this was known, all the persons\r\nconcerned in the latter case, foreign as well as native, were directed\r\nto be prosecuted. The Attorney General gave an official opinion that\r\nthe act was against law, and coincided with all our private opinions;\r\nand the lawyers of this State, New York and Maryland, who were applied\r\nto, were unanimously of the same opinion. Lately Mr. Rawle, Attorney of\r\nthe United States in this district, on a conference with the District\r\nJudge, Peters, supposed the law more doubtful. New acts, therefore, of\r\nthe same kind, are left unprosecuted till the question is determined by\r\nthe proper court, which will be during the present week. If they declare\r\nthe act no offence against the laws, the Executive will have acquitted\r\nitself towards the nation attacked by their citizens, by having submitted\r\nthem to the sentence of the laws of their country, and towards those\r\nlaws by an appeal to them in a case which interested the country, and\r\nwhich was at least doubtful. I confess I think myself that the case is\r\npunishable, and that, if found otherwise, Congress ought to make it so,\r\nor we shall be made parties in every maritime war in which the piratical\r\nspirit of the banditti in our ports can engage. I will write you what\r\nthe judicial determination is. Our prospects with Spain appear to me,\r\nfrom circumstances taking place on this side the Atlantic, absolutely\r\ndesperate. Measures are taken to know if they are equally so on the other\r\nside, and before the close of the year that question will be closed, and\r\nyour next meeting must probably prepare for the new order of things. I\r\nfear the disgust of France is inevitable. We shall be to blame in past.\r\nBut the new minister much more so. His conduct is indefensible by the\r\nmost furious Jacobin. I only wish our countrymen may distinguish between\r\nhim and his nation, and if the case should ever be laid before them, may\r\nnot suffer their affection to the nation to be diminished. H., sensible\r\nof the advantage they have got, is urging a full appeal by the Government\r\nto the people. Such an explosion would manifestly endanger a dissolution\r\nof the friendship between the two nations, and ought therefore to be\r\ndeprecated by every friend to our liberty; and none but an enemy to it\r\nwould wish to avail himself of the indiscretions of an individual to\r\ncompromit two nations esteeming each other ardently. It will prove that\r\nthe agents of the two people are either great bunglers or great rascals,\r\nwhen they cannot preserve that peace which is the universal wish of both.\r\nThe situation of the St. Domingo fugitives (aristocrats as they are) calls\r\naloud for pity and charity. Never was so deep a tragedy presented to the\r\nfeelings of man. I deny the power of the general government to apply money\r\nto such a purpose, but I deny it with a bleeding heart. It belongs to\r\nthe State governments. Pray urge ours to be liberal. The Executive should\r\nhazard themselves here on such an occasion, and the Legislature when it\r\nmeets ought to approve and extend it. It will have a great effect in doing\r\naway the impression of other disobligations towards France. I become daily\r\nmore convinced that all the West India islands will remain in the hands of\r\nthe people of color, and a total expulsion of the whites sooner or later\r\ntake place. It is high time we should pursue the bloody scenes which our\r\nchildren certainly, and possibly ourselves, (south of Potomac,) have to\r\nwade through, and try to avert them. We have no news from the continent\r\nof Europe later than the 1st of May. My love to Mrs. Monroe. Tell her they\r\nare paving the street before your new house. Adieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. DE VIAR AND JAUDENES.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, July 14, 1793.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I have laid before the President your letters of the 11th\r\nand 13th instant. Your residence in the United States has given you an\r\nopportunity of becoming acquainted with the extreme freedom of the press\r\nin these States. Considering its great importance to the public liberty,\r\nand the difficulty of subjecting it to very precise rules, the laws have\r\nthought it less mischievous to give greater scope to its freedom, than to\r\nthe restraint of it. The President has therefore no authority to prevent\r\npublications of the nature of those you complain of in your favor of\r\nthe 11th. I can only assure you that the government of the United States\r\nhas no part in them, and that all its expressions of respect towards his\r\nCatholic Majesty, public and private, have been as uniform as their desire\r\nto cultivate his friendship has been sincere.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the letters I have had the honor of receiving from you\r\nfor some time past, it must be candidly acknowledged that their complaints\r\nwere thought remarkable, as to the matters they brought forward as well as\r\nthe manner of expressing them. A succession of complaints, some founded\r\non small things taken up as great ones, some on suggestions contrary\r\nto our knowledge of things, yet treated as if true on very inconclusive\r\nevidence, and presented to view as rendering our peace very problematical,\r\nindicated a determination to find cause for breaking the peace. The\r\nPresident thought it was high time to come to an eclaircissement with your\r\ngovernment directly, and has taken the measure of sending a courier to\r\nMadrid for this purpose. This of course transfers all explanation of the\r\npast to another place. But the President is well pleased to hope from your\r\nletters of the 11th and 13th, that all perhaps had not been meant which\r\nhad been understood from your former correspondence, and will be still\r\nmore pleased to find these and all other difficulties between the two\r\ncountries settled in such a way as to insure their future friendship.\r\n\r\nI beg you to accept assurances of my particular esteem, and of the real\r\nrespect with which I have the honor to be, Gentlemen, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CHIEF JUSTICE AND JUDGES OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, July 18, 1793.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--The war which has taken place among the powers of Europe,\r\nproduces frequent transactions within our ports and limits, on which\r\nquestions arise of considerable difficulty, and of greater importance to\r\nthe peace of the United States. These questions depend for their solution\r\non the construction of our treaties, on the laws of nature and nations,\r\nand on the laws of the land; and are often presented under circumstances\r\nwhich do not give a cognizance of them to the tribunals of the country.\r\nYet their decision is so little analogous to the ordinary functions of the\r\nexecutive, as to occasion much embarrassment and difficulty to them. The\r\nPresident would, therefore, be much relieved, if he found himself free to\r\nrefer questions of this description to the opinions of the judges of the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States, whose knowledge of the subject would\r\nsecure us against errors dangerous to the peace of the United States,\r\nand their authority insure the respect of all parties. He has therefore\r\nasked the attendance of such judges as could be collected in time for the\r\noccasion, to know, in the first place, their opinion, whether the public\r\nmay with propriety be availed of their advice on these questions? And\r\nif they may, to present, for their advice, the abstract questions which\r\nhave already occurred, or may soon occur, from which they will themselves\r\nstrike out such as any circumstances might, in their opinion, forbid them\r\nto pronounce on.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of great esteem and respect,\r\nGentlemen, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                             July 21, 1792.\r\n\r\nI wrote you on the 14th, since which I have no letter from you. It appears\r\nthat two considerable engagements took place between France and the\r\ncombined armies on the 1st and 8th of May. In the former, the French have\r\nhad rather the worst of it, as may be concluded by their loss of cannon\r\nand loss of ground. In the latter, they have had rather the best, as is\r\nproved by their remaining on the ground, and their throwing relief into\r\nConde, which had been the object of both battles. The French attacked in\r\nboth. They have sent commissioners to England to sound for peace. General\r\nFelix Wimpfen is one. There is a strong belief that the bankruptcies and\r\ndemolitions of manufacturers through the three kingdoms, will induce\r\nthe English to accede to peace. E. R. is returned. The affair of the\r\nloan has been kept suspended, and is now submitted to him. He brings\r\nvery flattering information of the loyalty of the people of Virginia\r\nto the general government, and thinks the whole indisposition there is\r\ndirected against the Secretary of the Treasury _personally_, not against\r\nhis measures. On the whole he has quieted uneasiness here. I have never\r\nbeen able to get a sight of Billy till yesterday. He has promised to\r\nbring me the bill of your ploughs, which shall be paid. Adieu. Yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, July 24, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 9th instant, covering the information of Silvat\r\nDucamp, Pierre Nouvel, Chouquet de Savarence, Gaston de Nogere and G.\r\nBlustier, that being on their passage from the French West Indies to the\r\nUnited States, on board merchant vessels of the United States, with slaves\r\nand merchandise, of their property, these vessels were stopped by British\r\narmed vessels and their property taken out as lawful prize, has been\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\nI believe it cannot be doubted, but that by the general law of nations,\r\nthe goods of a friend found in the vessel of an enemy are free, and the\r\ngoods of an enemy found in the vessel of a friend are lawful prize.\r\nUpon this principle, I presume, the British armed vessels have taken\r\nthe property of French citizens found in our vessels, in the cases\r\nabove mentioned, and I confess I should be at a loss on what principle\r\nto reclaim it. It is true that sundry nations, desirous of avoiding the\r\ninconveniences of having their vessels stopped at sea, ransacked, carried\r\ninto port and detained, under pretence of having enemy goods aboard, have\r\nin many instances introduced by their special treaties another principle\r\nbetween them, that enemy bottoms shall make enemy goods, and friendly\r\nbottoms friendly goods; a principle much less embarrassing to commerce,\r\nand equal to all parties in point of gain and loss. But this is altogether\r\nthe effect of particular treaty, controlling in special cases the general\r\nprinciple of the law of nations, and therefore taking effect between\r\nsuch nations only as have so agreed to control it. England has generally\r\ndetermined to adhere to the rigorous principle, having, in no instance,\r\nas far as I recollect, agreed to the modification of letting the property\r\nof the goods follow that of the vessel, except in the single one of her\r\ntreaty with France. We have adopted this modification in our treaties\r\nwith France, the United Netherlands and Russia; and therefore, as to\r\nthem, our vessels cover the goods of their enemies, and we lose our goods\r\nwhen in the vessels of their enemies. Accordingly, you will be pleased to\r\nrecollect, that in the late case of Holland and Mackie, citizens of the\r\nUnited States, who had laden a cargo of flour on board a British vessel,\r\nwhich was taken by the French frigate l'Ambuscade and brought into this\r\nport, when I reclaimed the cargo it was only on the ground that they were\r\nignorant of the declaration of war when it was shipped. You observed,\r\nhowever, that the 14th article of our treaty had provided that ignorance\r\nshould not be pleaded beyond two months after the declaration of war,\r\nwhich term had elapsed in this case by some days, and finding that to\r\nbe the truth, though their real ignorance of the declaration was equally\r\ntrue, I declined the reclamation, as it never was in my view to reclaim\r\nthe cargo, nor apparently in yours, to offer to restore it, by questioning\r\nthe rule established in our treaty, that enemy bottoms make enemy goods.\r\nWith England, Spain, Portugal and Austria, we have no treaties; therefore,\r\nwe have nothing to oppose to their acting according to the general law\r\nof nations, that enemy goods are lawful prize though found in the bottom\r\nof a friend. Nor do I see that France can suffer on the whole; for though\r\nshe loses her goods in our vessels when found therein by England, Spain,\r\nPortugal, or Austria, yet she gains our goods when found in the vessels\r\nof England, Spain, Portugal, Austria, the United Netherlands, or Prussia;\r\nand I believe I may safely affirm that we have more goods afloat in the\r\nvessels of these six nations, than France has afloat in our vessels;\r\nand consequently, that France is the gainer, and we the loser by the\r\nprinciple of our treaty. Indeed, we are the losers in every direction of\r\nthat principle; for when it works in our favor, it is to save the goods\r\nof our friends, when it works against us, it is to lose our own; and we\r\nshall continue to lose while the rule is only partially established. When\r\nwe shall have established it with all nations, we shall be in a condition\r\nneither to gain nor lose, but shall be less exposed to vexatious searches\r\nat sea. To this condition we are endeavoring to advance; but as it depends\r\non the will of other nations as well as our own, we can only obtain it\r\nwhen they shall be ready to concur.\r\n\r\nI cannot, therefore, but flatter myself, that on revising the cases of\r\nDucamp and others, you will perceive that their losses result from the\r\nstate of war, which has permitted their enemies to take their goods,\r\nthough found in our vessels; and consequently, from circumstances over\r\nwhich we have no control.\r\n\r\nThe rudeness to their persons, practised by their enemies, is certainly\r\nnot favorable to the character of the latter. We feel for it as much as\r\nfor the extension of it to our own citizens, then companions, and find in\r\nit a motive the more for requiring measures to be taken which may prevent\r\nrepetitions of it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, July 31, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--When you did me the honor of appointing me to the office I now\r\nhold, I engaged in it without a view of continuing any length of time,\r\nand I pretty early concluded on the close of the first four years of our\r\nRepublic as a proper period for withdrawing; which I had the honor of\r\ncommunicating to you. When the period, however, arrived, circumstances had\r\narisen, which, in the opinion of some of my friends, rendered it proper\r\nto postpone my purpose for awhile. These circumstances have now ceased\r\nin such a degree as to leave me free to think again of a day on which I\r\nmay withdraw without its exciting disadvantageous opinions or conjectures\r\nof any kind. The close of the present quarter seems to be a convenient\r\nperiod, because the quarterly accounts of the domestic department are\r\nthen settled of course, and by that time, also, I may hope to receive from\r\nabroad the materials for bringing up the foreign account to the end of its\r\nthird year. At the close, therefore, of the ensuing month of September,\r\nI shall beg leave to retire to scenes of greater tranquility, from those\r\nwhich I am every day more and more convinced that neither my talents, tone\r\nof mind, nor time of life fit me. I have thought it my duty to mention the\r\nmatter thus early, that there may be time for the arrival of a successor,\r\nfrom any part of the Union from which you may think proper to call one.\r\nThat you may find one more able to lighten the burthen of your labors,\r\nI most sincerely wish; for no man living more sincerely wishes that your\r\nadministration could be rendered as pleasant to yourself, as it is useful\r\nand necessary to our country, nor feels for you a more rational or cordial\r\nattachment and respect than, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, August 7, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In a letter of June the 5th, I had the honor to inform you that the\r\nPresident, after reconsidering, at your request, the case of vessels armed\r\nwithin our ports to commit hostilities on nations at peace with the United\r\nStates, had finally determined that it could not be admitted, and desired\r\nthat all those which had been so armed should depart from our ports. It\r\nbeing understood afterwards, that these vessels either still remained\r\nin our ports, or had only left them to cruise on our coasts and return\r\nagain with their prizes, and that another vessel, the Little Democrat,\r\nhad been since armed at Philadelphia, it was desired, in my letter of the\r\n12th of July, that such vessels, with their prizes, should be detained,\r\ntill a determination should be had of what was to be done under these\r\ncircumstances. In disregard, however, of this desire, the Little Democrat\r\nwent out immediately on a cruise.\r\n\r\nI have it now in charge to inform you, that the President considers\r\nthe United States as bound, pursuant to positive assurances given in\r\nconformity to the laws of neutrality, to effectuate the restoration of or\r\nto make compensation for prizes, which shall have been made of any of the\r\nparties at war with France, subsequent to the fifth day of June last, by\r\nprivateers fitted out of our ports.\r\n\r\nThat it is consequently expected, that you will cause restitution to be\r\nmade of all prizes taken and brought into our ports subsequent to the\r\nabove-mentioned day by such privateers, in defect of which, the President\r\nconsiders it as incumbent upon the United States to indemnify the owners\r\nof those prizes; the indemnification to be reimbursed by the French\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nThat besides taking efficacious measures to prevent the future fitting out\r\nof privateers in the ports of the United States, they will not give asylum\r\ntherein to any which shall have been at any time so fitted out, and will\r\ncause restitution of all such prizes as shall be hereafter brought within\r\ntheir ports by any of the said privateers.\r\n\r\nIt would have been but proper respect to the authority of the country,\r\nhad that been consulted before these armaments were undertaken. It would\r\nhave been satisfactory, however, if their sense of them, when declared,\r\nhad been duly acquiesced in. Reparation of the injury to which the United\r\nStates have been made so involuntarily instrumental is all which now\r\nremains, and in this your compliance cannot but be expected.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the information given in your letter of the 4th instant,\r\nthat certain citizens of St. Domingo, lately arrived in the United States,\r\nwere associating for the purpose of undertaking a military expedition from\r\nthe territory of the United States, against that island, the Governor of\r\nMaryland, within which State the expedition is understood to be preparing,\r\nis instructed to take effectual measures to prevent the same.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                           August 11, 1793.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson, with his respects to the President, begs leave to\r\nexpress in writing more exactly what he meant to have said yesterday. A\r\njourney home in the autumn is of a necessity which he cannot control after\r\nthe arrangements he has made, and when there, it would be his extreme wish\r\nto remain. But if the continuance in office to the last of December, as\r\nintimated by the President, would, by bringing the two appointments nearer\r\ntogether, enable him to marshal them more beneficially to the public, and\r\nmore to his own satisfaction, either motive will suffice to induce Thomas\r\nJefferson to continue till that time; he submits it therefore to the\r\nPresident's judgment, which he will be glad to receive when convenient, as\r\nthe arrangements he had taken may require some change.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\n                                                           August 11, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 3d instant. Yours of July 30th,\r\ncame to hand yesterday. Besides the present which goes by post, I\r\nwrite you another to-day to go by Mr. D. Randolph, who sets out the day\r\nafter to-morrow for Monticello, but whether by the direct route or via\r\nRichmond is not yet decided. I shall desire that letter to be sent to\r\nyou by express from Monticello. I have not been able to lay my hands on\r\nthe newspaper which gave a short but true view of the intention of the\r\nproclamation; however, having occasion to state it in a paper which I\r\nam preparing, I have done it in the following terms, and I give you the\r\nvery words from the paper, because just as I had finished so far, 812.15.\r\ncalled on me. I read it to him. He said it presented fairly his view of\r\nthe matter. He recalled to my mind that I had, at the time, opposed its\r\nbeing made a declaration of neutrality on the ground that the Executive\r\nwas not the competent authority for that, and, therefore, that it was\r\nagreed the instrument should be drawn with great care. My statement is in\r\nthese words: \"On the declaration of war between France and England, the\r\nUnited States being at peace with both, their situation was so new and\r\nunexperienced by themselves, that their citizens were not, in the first\r\ninstant, sensible of the new duties resulting therefrom, and of the laws\r\nit would impose _even on their dispositions_ towards the belligerent\r\npowers. Some of them imagined (and chiefly their transient sea-faring\r\ncitizens) that they were free to indulge those dispositions, to take\r\nside with either party, and enrich themselves by depredations on the\r\ncommerce of the other, and were meditating enterprises of this nature,\r\nas was said. In this state of the public mind, and before it should\r\ntake an erroneous direction difficult to be set right, and dangerous to\r\nthemselves and their country, the President thought it expedient, by way\r\nof Proclamation, to remind our fellow-citizens that we were in a state of\r\npeace with all the belligerent powers; that in that state it was our duty\r\nneither to aid nor injure any; to exhort and warn them against acts which\r\nmight contravene this duty, and particularly those of positive hostility,\r\nfor the punishment of which the laws would be appealed to, and to put\r\nthem on their guard also as to the risks they would run if they should\r\nattempt to carry articles of contraband to any.\" Very soon afterwards we\r\nlearnt that he was undertaking the fitting and arming vessels in that\r\nport, enlisting men, foreign and citizens, and giving them commissions\r\nto cruise and commit hostilities against nations at peace with us, that\r\nthese vessels were taking and bringing prizes into our ports, that the\r\nconsuls of France were assuming to hold courts of admiralty on them, to\r\ntry, condemn and authorize their sale as legal prizes, and all this before\r\nMr. Genet had presented himself or his credentials to the President,\r\nbefore he was received by him, without his consent or consultation, and\r\ndirectly in contravention of the state of peace existing and declared to\r\nexist in the President's proclamation, and which it was incumbent on him\r\nto preserve till the Constitutional authority should otherwise declare.\r\nThese proceedings became immediately, as was naturally to be expected,\r\nthe subject of complaint by the representative here of that power against\r\nwhom they would chiefly operate, &c. This was the true sense of the\r\nproclamation in the view of the draughtsman and of the two signers; but\r\nH. had other views. The instrument was badly drawn, and made the P. go\r\nout of his line to declare things which, though true, it was not exactly\r\nhis province to declare. The instrument was communicated to me after it\r\nwas drawn, but I was busy, and only run an eye over it to see that it was\r\nnot made a declaration of neutrality, and gave it back again, without, I\r\nbelieve, changing a tittle. Pacificus has now changed his signature to\r\n\"no Jacobin.\" Three papers under this signature have been published in\r\nDunlap. I suppose they will get into Fenno. They are commentaries on the\r\nlaws of nations and on the different parts of our treaty with France. As\r\nyet they have presented no very important heresy. Congress will not meet\r\ntill the legal day. It was referred to a meeting at my office to consider\r\nand advice on it. I was for calling them. Kin. against it. H. said his\r\njudgment was against it. But he would join any two who should concur so as\r\nto make a majority either way. R. was pointedly against it. We agreed to\r\ngive our opinions separately, and though the P. was in his own judgment\r\nfor calling them, he acquiesced in the majority. I pass on to the other\r\nletter; so adieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNEUR MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                             PHILADELPHIA, August 16, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In my letter of January the 13th, I enclosed to you copies of\r\nseveral letters which had passed between Mr. Ternant, Mr. Genet and\r\nmyself, on the occurrences to which the present war had given rise within\r\nour ports. The object of this communication was to enable you to explain\r\nthe principle on which our government was conducting itself towards\r\nthe belligerent parties; principles which might not in all cases be\r\nsatisfactory to all, but were meant to be just and impartial to all. Mr.\r\nGenet had been then but a little time with us; and but a little more was\r\nnecessary to develop in him a character and conduct so unexpected and so\r\nextraordinary, as to place us in the most distressing dilemma, between\r\nour regard for his nation, which is constant and sincere, and a regard for\r\nour laws, the authority of which must be maintained; for the peace of our\r\ncountry, which the executive magistrate is charged to preserve; for its\r\nhonor, offended in the person of that magistrate; and for its character\r\ngrossly traduced, in the conversations and letters of this gentleman. In\r\nthe course of these transactions, it has been a great comfort to us to\r\nbelieve, that none of them were within the intentions or expectations of\r\nhis employers. These had been too recently expressed in acts which nothing\r\ncould discolor, in the letters of the Executive Council, in the letter\r\nand decrees of the National Assembly, and in the general demeanor of the\r\nnation towards us, to describe to them things of so contrary a character.\r\nOur first duty, therefore, was, to draw a strong line between their\r\nintentions and the proceedings of their minister; our second, to lay those\r\nproceedings faithfully before them.\r\n\r\nOn the declaration of war between France and England, the United States\r\nbeing at peace with both, their situation was so new and unexperienced by\r\nthemselves, that their citizens were not, in the first instant, sensible\r\nof the new duties resulting therefrom, and of the restraints it would\r\nimpose even _on their dispositions_ towards the belligerent powers. Some\r\nof them imagined (and chiefly their transient sea-faring citizens) that\r\nthey were free to indulge those dispositions, to take side with either\r\nparty, and enrich themselves by depredations on the commerce of the other,\r\nand were meditating enterprises of this nature, as there was reason to\r\nbelieve. In this state of the public mind, and before it should take an\r\nerroneous direction, difficult to be set right and dangerous to themselves\r\nand their country, the President thought it expedient, through the channel\r\nof a proclamation, to remind our fellow-citizens that we were in a state\r\nof peace with all the belligerent powers, that in that state it was our\r\nduty neither to aid nor injure any, to exhort and warn them against acts\r\nwhich might contravene this duty, and particularly those of positive\r\nhostility, for the punishment of which the laws would be appealed to; and\r\nto put them on their guard also, as to the risks they would run, if they\r\nshould attempt to carry articles of contraband to any. This proclamation,\r\nordered on the 19th and signed the 22d day of April, was sent to you in my\r\nletter of the 26th of the same month.\r\n\r\nOn the day of its publication, we received, through the channel of the\r\nnewspapers, the first intimation that Mr. Genet had arrived on the 8th\r\nof the month at Charleston, in the character of Minister Plenipotentiary\r\nfrom his nation to the United States, and soon after, that he had sent\r\non to Philadelphia the vessel in which he came, and would himself perform\r\nthe journey by land. His landing at one of the most distant ports of the\r\nUnion from his points both of departure and destination, was calculated\r\nto excite attention; and very soon afterwards, we learned that he was\r\nundertaking to authorize the fitting and arming vessels in that port,\r\nenlisting men, foreigners and citizens, and giving them commissions to\r\ncruise and commit hostilities on nations at peace with us; that these\r\nvessels were taking and bringing prizes into our ports; that the consuls\r\nof France were assuming to hold courts of admiralty on them, to try,\r\ncondemn, and authorize their sale as legal prize, and all this before Mr.\r\nGenet had presented himself or his credentials to the President, before\r\nhe was received by him, without his consent or consultation, and directly\r\nin contravention of the state of peace existing, and declared to exist\r\nin the President's proclamation, and incumbent on him to preserve till\r\nthe constitutional authority should otherwise declare. These proceedings\r\nbecame immediately, as was naturally to be expected, the subject of\r\ncomplaint by the representative here of that power against whom they would\r\nchiefly operate. The British minister presented several memorials thereon,\r\nto which we gave the answer of May the 15th, heretofore enclosed to you,\r\ncorresponding in substance with a letter of the same date written to Mr.\r\nTernant, the minister of France then residing here, a copy of which I\r\nsend herewith. On the next day Mr. Genet reached this place, about five\r\nor six weeks after he had arrived at Charleston, and might have been\r\nat Philadelphia, if he had steered for it directly. He was immediately\r\npresented to the President, and received by him as the minister of the\r\nrepublic; and as the conduct before stated seemed to bespeak a design\r\nof forcing us into the war without allowing us the exercise of any free\r\nwill in the case, nothing could be more assuaging than his assurance to\r\nthe President at his reception, which he repeated to me afterwards in\r\nconversation, and in public to the citizens of Philadelphia in answer to\r\nan address from them, that on account of our remote situation and other\r\ncircumstances, France did not expect that we should become a party to the\r\nwar, but wished to see us pursue our prosperity and happiness in peace.\r\nIn a conversation a few days after, Mr. Genet told me that M. de Ternant\r\nhad delivered him my letter of May the 15th. He spoke something of the\r\ncase of the Grange, and then of the armament at Charleston, explained the\r\ncircumstances which had led him to it before he had been received by the\r\ngovernment and had consulted its will, expressed a hope that the President\r\nhad not so absolutely decided against the measure but that he would hear\r\nwhat was to be said in support of it, that he would write me a letter on\r\nthe subject, in which he thought he could justify it under our treaty; but\r\nthat if the President should finally determine otherwise, he must submit;\r\nfor that assuredly his instructions were to do what would be agreeable to\r\nus. He accordingly wrote the letter of May the 27th. The President took\r\nthe case again into consideration, and found nothing in that letter which\r\ncould shake the grounds of his former decision. My letter of June the 5th\r\nnotifying this to him, his of June the 8th and 14th, mine of the 17th,\r\nand his again of the 22d, will show what further passed on this subject,\r\nand that he was far from retaining his disposition to acquiesce in the\r\nultimate will of the President.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to pursue this and our subsequent correspondence\r\nthrough all their details. Referring, therefore, for these to the letters\r\nthemselves, which shall accompany this, I will present a summary view\r\nonly of all the points of difference which have arisen, and the grounds on\r\nwhich they rest.\r\n\r\n1. Mr. Genet asserts his right of arming in our ports and of enlisting\r\nour citizens, and that we have no right to restrain him or punish them.\r\nExamining this question under the law of nations, founded on the general\r\nsense and usage of mankind, we have produced proofs, from the most\r\nenlightened and approved writers on the subject, that a neutral nation\r\nmust, in all things relating to the war, observe an exact impartiality\r\ntowards the parties, that favors to one to the prejudice of the other,\r\nwould import a fraudulent neutrality, of which no nation would be the\r\ndupe; that no succor should be given to either, unless stipulated by\r\ntreaty, in men, arms, or anything else directly serving for war; that\r\nthe right of raising troops being one of the rights of sovereignty, and\r\nconsequently appertaining exclusively to the nation itself, no foreign\r\npower or person can levy men within its territory without its consent;\r\nand he who does, may be rightfully and severely punished; that if the\r\nUnited States have a right to refuse the permission to arm vessels and\r\nraise men within their ports and territories, they are bound by the laws\r\nof neutrality to exercise that right, and to prohibit such armaments and\r\nenlistments. To these principles of the law of nations Mr. Genet answers,\r\nby calling them \"diplomatic subtleties,\" and \"aphorisms of Vattel and\r\nothers.\" But something more than this is necessary to disprove them; and\r\ntill they are disproved, we hold it certain that the law of nations and\r\nthe rules of neutrality forbid our permitting either party to arm in our\r\nports.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Genet says, that the twenty-second article of our treaty allows\r\nhim _expressly_ to arm in our ports. Why has he not quoted the very words\r\nof that article _expressly_ allowing it? For that would have put an end\r\nto all further question. The words of the article are, \"it shall not be\r\nlawful for any foreign privateers not belonging to subjects of the M.\r\nC. King, nor citizens of the said United States, who have commissions\r\nfrom any foreign Prince or State in enmity with either nation, to fit\r\ntheir ships in the ports of either the one or the other of the aforesaid\r\nparties.\" Translate this from the general terms in which it here\r\nstands, into the special case produced by the present war. \"Privateers\r\nnot belonging to France or the United States, and having commissions\r\nfrom the enemies of one of them,\" are, in the present state of things,\r\n\"British, Dutch and Spanish privateers.\" Substituting these, then, for the\r\nequivalent terms, it will stand thus, \"it shall not be lawful for British,\r\nDutch or Spanish privateers to fit their ships in the ports of the United\r\nStates.\" Is this an _express_ permission to France to do it? Does the\r\nnegative to the enemies of France, and silence as to France herself,\r\nimply an affirmative to France? Certainly not; it leaves the question as\r\nto France open, and free to be decided according to circumstances. And if\r\nthe parties had meant an affirmative stipulation, they would have provided\r\nfor it expressly; they would never have left so important a point to be\r\ninferred from mere silence or implications. Suppose they had desired to\r\nstipulate a refusal to their enemies, but nothing to themselves; what form\r\nof expression would they have used? Certainly the one they have used; an\r\nexpress stipulation as to their enemies, and silence as to themselves.\r\nAnd such an intention corresponds not only with the words, but with the\r\ncircumstances of the times. It was of value to each party to exclude\r\nits enemies from arming in the ports of the other, and could in no case\r\nembarrass them. They therefore stipulated so far mutually. But each might\r\nbe embarrassed by permitting the other to arm in its ports. They therefore\r\nwould not stipulate to permit that. Let us go back to the state of things\r\nin France when this treaty was made, and we shall find several cases\r\nwherein France could not have permitted us to arm in her ports. Suppose a\r\nwar between these States and Spain. We know, that by the treaties between\r\nFrance and Spain, the former could not permit the enemies of the latter\r\nto arm in her ports. It was honest in her, therefore, not to deceive\r\nus by such a stipulation. Suppose a war between these States and Great\r\nBritain. By the treaties between France and Great Britain, in force at the\r\nsignature of ours, we could not have been permitted to arm in the ports\r\nof France. She could not then have meant in this article to give us such\r\na right. She has manifested the same sense of it in her subsequent treaty\r\nwith England, made eight years after the date of ours, stipulating in the\r\nsixteenth article of it, as in our twenty-second, that foreign privateers,\r\n_not being subjects of either crown_, should not arm against either in the\r\nports of the other. If this had amounted to an affirmative stipulation\r\nthat the subjects of the other crown might arm in her ports _against\r\nus_, it would have been in direct contradiction to her twenty-second\r\narticle with us. So that to give to these negative stipulations an\r\naffirmative effect, is to render them inconsistent with each other, and\r\nwith good faith; to give them only their negative and natural effect,\r\nis to reconcile them to one another and to good faith, and is clearly to\r\nadopt the sense in which France herself has expounded them. We may justly\r\nconclude, then, that the article only obliges us to refuse this right,\r\nin the present case, to Great Britain and the other enemies of France. It\r\ndoes not go on to give it to France, either expressly or by implication.\r\nWe may then refuse it. And since we are bound by treaty to refuse it to\r\nthe one party, and are free to refuse it to that other, we are bound by\r\nthe laws of neutrality to refuse it to the other. The aiding either party\r\nthen with vessels, arms or men, being unlawful by the law of nations,\r\nand not rendered lawful by the treaty, it is made a question whether our\r\ncitizens, joining in these unlawful enterprises, may be punished?\r\n\r\nThe United States being in a state of peace with most of the belligerent\r\npowers by treaty, and with all of them by the laws of nature, murders\r\nand robberies committed by our citizens within our territory, or on the\r\nhigh seas, on those with whom we are so at peace, are punishable equally\r\nas if committed on our own inhabitants. If I might venture to reason a\r\nlittle formally, without being charged with running into 'subtleties and\r\naphorisms,' I would say that if one citizen has a right to go to war of\r\nhis own authority, every citizen has the same. If every citizen has that\r\nright, then the nation (which is composed of all its citizens) has a right\r\nto go to war, by the authority of its individual citizen. But this is not\r\ntrue either on the general principles of society, or by our Constitution,\r\nwhich gives that power to Congress alone, and not to the citizens\r\nindividually. Then the first position was not true; and no citizen has\r\na right to go to war of his own authority; and for what he does without\r\nright, he ought to be punished. Indeed, nothing can be more obviously\r\nabsurd than to say, that all the citizens may be at war, and yet the\r\nnation at peace.\r\n\r\nIt has been pretended, indeed, that the engagement of a citizen in an\r\nenterprise of this nature, was a divestment of the character of citizen,\r\nand a transfer of jurisdiction over him to another sovereign. Our citizens\r\nare certainly free to divest themselves of that character by emigration\r\nand other acts manifesting their intention, and may then become the\r\nsubjects of another power, and free to do whatever the subjects of that\r\npower may do. But the laws do not admit that the bare commission of a\r\ncrime amounts of itself to a divestment of the character of citizen, and\r\nwithdraws the criminal from their coercion. They would never prescribe an\r\nillegal act among the legal modes by which a citizen might disfranchise\r\nhimself; nor render treason, for instance, innocent by giving it the\r\nforce of a dissolution of the obligation of the criminal to his country.\r\nAccordingly, in the case of Henfeild, a citizen of these States, charged\r\nwith having engaged in the port of Charleston, in an enterprise against\r\nnations at peace with us, and with having joined in the actual commission\r\nof hostilities, the Attorney General of the United States, in an official\r\nopinion, declared that the act with which he was charged was punishable\r\nby law. The same thing has been unanimously declared by two of the\r\ncircuit courts of the United States, as you will see in the charges of\r\nChief Justice Jay, delivered at Richmond, and Judge Wilson, delivered\r\nat Philadelphia, both of which are herewith sent. Yet Mr. Genet, in the\r\nmoment he lands at Charleston, is able to tell the Governor, and continues\r\nto affirm in his correspondence here, that no law of the United States\r\nauthorizes their government to restrain either its own citizens or the\r\nforeigners inhabiting its territory, from warring against the enemies of\r\nFrance. It is true, indeed, that in the case of Henfeild, the jury which\r\ntried, absolved him. But it appeared on the trial, that the crime was\r\nnot knowingly and wilfully committed; that Henfeild was ignorant of the\r\nunlawfulness of his undertaking; that in the moment he was apprised of\r\nit he showed real contrition; that he had rendered meritorious services\r\nduring the late war, and declared he would live and die an American. The\r\njury, therefore, in absolving him, did no more than the constitutional\r\nauthority might have done, had they found him guilty: the Constitution\r\nhaving provided for the pardon of offences in certain cases, and there\r\nbeing no case where it would have been more proper than where no offence\r\nwas contemplated. Henfeild, therefore, was still an American citizen, and\r\nMr. Genet's reclamation of him was as unauthorized as the first enlistment\r\nof him.\r\n\r\n2. Another doctrine, advanced by Mr. Genet is, that our courts can take no\r\ncognizance of questions whether vessels, _held by theirs_ as prizes, are\r\nlawful prizes or not; that this jurisdiction belongs exclusively to their\r\nconsulates here, which have been lately erected by the National Assembly\r\ninto complete courts of admiralty.\r\n\r\nLet us consider, first, what is the extent of jurisdiction which the\r\nconsulates of France may rightfully exercise here. Every nation has of\r\nnatural right, entirely and exclusively, all the jurisdiction which may\r\nbe rightfully exercised in the territory it occupies. If it cedes any\r\nportion of that jurisdiction to judges appointed by another nation, the\r\nlimits of their power must depend on the instrument of cession. The United\r\nStates and France have, by their consular convention, given mutually to\r\ntheir consuls jurisdiction in certain cases especially enumerated. But\r\nthat convention gives to neither the power of establishing complete courts\r\nof admiralty within the territory of the other, nor even of deciding\r\nthe particular question of prize or not prize. The consulates of France,\r\nthen, cannot take judicial cognizance of those questions here. Of this\r\nopinion Mr. Genet was when he wrote his letter of May the 27th, wherein\r\nhe promises to correct the error of the consul at Charleston, of whom, in\r\nmy letters of the 15th instant, I had complained, as arrogating to himself\r\nthat jurisdiction; though in his subsequent letters he has thought proper\r\nto embark in the errors of his consuls.\r\n\r\nBut the United States, at the same time, do not pretend any right to try\r\nthe validity of captures made _on the high seas_, by France, or any other\r\nnation, over its enemies. These questions belong, of common usage, to the\r\nsovereign of the captor, and whenever it is necessary to determine them,\r\nresort must be had to his courts. This is the case provided for in the\r\nseventeenth article of the treaty, which says, that such prizes shall not\r\nbe arrested, nor cognizance taken of the validity thereof; a stipulation\r\nmuch insisted on by Mr. Genet and the consuls, and which we never thought\r\nof infringing or questioning. As the validity of captures then, made _on\r\nthe high seas_ by France over its enemies, cannot be tried within the\r\nUnited States by their consuls, so neither can they by our own courts. Nor\r\nis this the question between us, though we have been misled into it.\r\n\r\nThe real question is, whether the United States have not a right to\r\nprotect vessels within their waters and on their coasts? The Grange\r\nwas taken within the Delaware, between the shores of Jersey and of the\r\nDelaware State, and several miles above its mouth. The seizing her was a\r\nflagrant violation of the jurisdiction of the United States. Mr. Genet,\r\nhowever, instead of apologizing, takes great merit in his letters for\r\ngiving her up. The William is said to have been taken within two miles of\r\nthe shores of the United States. When the admiralty declined cognizance of\r\nthe case, she was delivered to the French consul according to my letter of\r\nJune the 25th, to be kept till the executive of the United States should\r\nexamine into the case; and Mr. Genet was desired by my letter of June the\r\n29th, to have them furnished with the evidence on behalf of the captors,\r\nas to the place of capture. Yet to this day it has never been done. The\r\nbrig Fanny was alleged to be taken within five miles from our shore; the\r\nCatharine within two miles and a half. It is an essential attribute of the\r\njurisdiction of every country to preserve peace, to punish acts in breach\r\nof it, and to restore property taken by force within its limits. Were the\r\narmed vessel of any nation to cut away one of our own from the wharves of\r\nPhiladelphia, and to chose to call it a prize, would this exclude us from\r\nthe right of redressing the wrong? Were it the vessel of another nation,\r\nare we not equally bound to protect it, while within our limits? Were it\r\nseized in any other of our waters, or on the shores of the United States,\r\nthe right of redressing is still the same; and humble indeed would be our\r\ncondition, were we obliged to depend for that on the will of a foreign\r\nconsul, or on negotiation with diplomatic agents. Accordingly, this\r\nright of protection within its waters and to a reasonable distance on its\r\ncoasts, has been acknowledged by every nation, and denied to none; and if\r\nthe property seized be yet within their power, it is their right and duty\r\nto redress the wrong themselves. France herself has asserted the right\r\nin herself and recognized it in us, in the sixth article of our treaty,\r\nwhere we mutually stipulate that we will, _by all the means in our power_\r\n(not by negotiation), protect and defend each other's vessels and effects\r\nin our ports or roads, or on the seas near our countries, and recover and\r\nrestore the same to the right owners. The United Netherlands, Prussia and\r\nSweden, have recognized it also in treaties with us; and, indeed, it is a\r\nstanding formula, inserted in almost all the treaties of all nations, and\r\nproving the principle to be acknowledged by all nations.\r\n\r\nHow, and by what organ of the government, whether judiciary or executive,\r\nit shall be redressed, is not yet perfectly settled with us. One of\r\nthe subordinate courts of admiralty has been of opinion, in the first\r\ninstance, in the case of the ship William, that it does not belong to the\r\njudiciary. Another, perhaps, may be of a contrary opinion. The question is\r\nstill _sub judice_, and an appeal to the court of last resort will decide\r\nit finally. If finally the judiciary shall declare that it does not belong\r\nto the _civil_ authority, it then results to the executive, charged with\r\nthe direction of the _military_ force of the Union, and the conduct of\r\nits affairs with foreign nations. But this is a mere question of internal\r\narrangement between the different departments of the government, depending\r\non the particular diction of the laws and Constitution; and it can in\r\nnowise concern a foreign nation to which department these have delegated\r\nit.\r\n\r\n3. Mr. Genet, in his letter of July the 9th, requires that the ship Jane,\r\nwhich he calls an English privateer, shall be immediately ordered to\r\ndepart; and to justify this, he appeals to the 22d article of our treaty,\r\nwhich provides that it shall not be lawful for any foreign _privateer_ to\r\nfit their ships in our ports, to sell _what they have taken_, or purchase\r\nvictuals, &c. The ship Jane is an English merchant vessel, which has been\r\nmany years employed in the commerce between Jamaica and these States. She\r\nbrought here a cargo of produce from that island, and was to take away\r\na cargo of flour. Knowing of the war when she left Jamaica, and that our\r\ncoast was lined with small French privateers, she armed for her defence,\r\nand took one of those commissions usually called _letters of marque_. She\r\narrived here safely without having had any rencounter of any sort. Can\r\nit be necessary to say that a merchant vessel is not a privateer? That\r\nthough she has arms to defend herself in time of war, in the course of her\r\nregular commerce, this no more makes her a privateer, than a husbandman\r\nfollowing his plough in time of war, with a knife or pistol in his pocket,\r\nis thereby made a soldier? The occupation of a privateer is attack and\r\nplunder, that of a merchant vessel is commerce and self-preservation.\r\nThe article excludes the former from our ports, and from selling _what\r\nshe has taken_, that is, what she has acquired by war, to show it did not\r\nmean the merchant vessel, and what she had acquired by commerce. Were the\r\nmerchant vessels coming for our produce forbidden to have any arms for\r\ntheir defence, every adventurer who had a boat, or money enough to buy\r\none, would make her a privateer, our coasts would swarm with them, foreign\r\nvessels must cease to come, our commerce must be suppressed, our produce\r\nremain on our hands, or at least that great portion of it which we have\r\nnot vessels to carry away, our ploughs must be laid aside and agriculture\r\nsuspended. This is a sacrifice no treaty could ever contemplate, and which\r\nwe are not disposed to make out of mere complaisance to a false definition\r\nof the term _privateer_. Finding that the Jane had purchased new carriages\r\nto mount two or three additional guns, which she had brought in her hold,\r\nand that she had opened additional port-holes for them, the carriages were\r\nordered to be re-landed, the additional port-holes stopped, and her means\r\nof defence reduced, to be exactly the same at her departure as at her\r\narrival. This was done on the general principle of allowing no party to\r\narm within our ports.\r\n\r\n4. The seventeenth article of our treaty leaves armed vessels free to\r\n_conduct_, whithersoever they please, the ships and goods taken from their\r\nenemies without paying any duty, and to depart and be conducted freely\r\nto the places expressed in their commissions, which the captain shall be\r\nobliged to show. It is evident, that this article does not contemplate a\r\nfreedom _to sell their prizes_ here; but on the contrary, a _departure_\r\nto some other place, always to be expressed in their commission, where\r\ntheir validity is to be finally adjudged. In such case, it would be as\r\nunreasonable to demand duties on the goods they had taken from an enemy,\r\nas it would be on the cargo of a merchant vessel touching in our ports for\r\nrefreshment or advices; and against this the article provides. But the\r\narmed vessels of France have been also admitted to land and sell their\r\nprize goods here for consumption, in which case, it is as reasonable\r\nthey should pay duties, as the goods of a merchantman landed and sold\r\nfor consumption. They have however demanded, and as a matter of right, to\r\nsell them free of duty, a right, they say, given by this article of the\r\ntreaty, though the article does not give the right to sell at all. Where a\r\ntreaty does not give the principal right of selling, the additional one of\r\nselling duty free cannot be given; and the laws in admitting the principal\r\nright of selling, may withhold the additional one of selling duty free. It\r\nmust be observed, that our revenues are raised almost wholly on imported\r\ngoods. Suppose prize goods enough should be brought in to supply our\r\nwhole consumption. According to their construction we are to lose our\r\nwhole revenue. I put the extreme case to evince, more extremely, the\r\nunreasonableness of the claim. Partial supplies would affect the revenue\r\nbut partially. They would lessen the evil, but not the error, of the\r\nconstruction; and I believe we may say, with truth, that neither party had\r\nit in contemplation, when penning this article, to abandon any part of its\r\nrevenue for the encouragement of the sea robbers of the other.\r\n\r\n5. Another source of complaint with Mr. Genet has been, that the English\r\ntake French goods out of American vessels, which he says is against\r\nthe law of nations and ought to be prevented by us. On the contrary,\r\nwe suppose it to have been long an established principle of the law of\r\nnations, that the goods of a friend are free in an enemy's vessel, and an\r\nenemy's goods lawful prize in the vessel of a friend. The inconvenience\r\nof this principle which subjects merchant vessels to be stopped at sea,\r\nsearched, ransacked, led out of their course, has induced several nations\r\nlatterly to stipulate against it by treaty, and to substitute another\r\nin its stead, that free bottoms shall make free goods, and enemy bottoms\r\nenemy goods; a rule equal to the other in point of loss and gain, but less\r\noppressive to commerce. As far as it has been introduced, it depends on\r\nthe treaties stipulating it, and forms exceptions, in special cases, to\r\nthe general operation of the law of nations. We have introduced it into\r\nour treaties with France, Holland and Prussia; and French goods found\r\nby the two latter nations in American bottoms are not made prize of. It\r\nis our wish to establish it with other nations. But this requires their\r\nconsent also, is a work of time, and in the meanwhile, they have a right\r\nto act on the general principle, without giving to us or to France cause\r\nof complaint. Nor do I see that France can lose by it on the whole. For\r\nthough she loses _her_ goods when found in our vessels by the nations\r\nwith whom we have no treaties, yet she gains _our_ goods, when found in\r\nthe vessels of the same and all other nations; and we believe the latter\r\nmass to be greater than the former. It is to be lamented, indeed, that\r\nthe general principle has operated so cruelly in the dreadful calamity\r\nwhich has lately happened in St. Domingo. The miserable fugitives, who,\r\nto save their lives, had taken asylum in our vessels, with such valuable\r\nand portable things as could be gathered in the moment out of the ashes of\r\ntheir houses and wrecks of their fortunes, have been plundered of these\r\nremains by the licensed sea rovers of their enemies. This has swelled,\r\non this occasion, the disadvantages of the general principle, that \"an\r\nenemy's goods are free prize in the vessels of a friend.\" But it is one of\r\nthose deplorable and unforeseen calamities to which they expose themselves\r\nwho enter into a state of war, furnishing to us an awful lesson to avoid\r\nit by justice and moderation, and not a cause or encouragement to expose\r\nour own towns to the same burning and butcheries, nor of complaint because\r\nwe do not.\r\n\r\n6. In a case like the present, where the missionary of one government\r\nconstrues differently from that to which he is sent, the treaties and laws\r\nwhich are to form a common rule of action for both, it would be unjust\r\nin either to claim an exclusive right of construction. Each nation has an\r\nequal right to expound the meaning of their common rules; and reason and\r\nusage have established, in such cases, a convenient and well-understood\r\ntrain of proceeding. It is the right and duty of the foreign missionary\r\nto urge his own constructions, to support them with reasons which may\r\nconvince, and in terms of decency and respect which may reconcile the\r\ngovernment of the country to a concurrence. It is the duty of that\r\ngovernment to listen to his reasonings with attention and candor, and to\r\nyield to them when just. But if it shall still appear to them that reason\r\nand right are on their side, it follows of necessity, that exercising the\r\nsovereign powers of the country, they have a right to proceed on their\r\nown constructions and conclusions as to whatever is to be done within\r\ntheir limits. The minister then refers the case to his own government,\r\nasks new instructions, and, in the meantime, acquiesces in the authority\r\nof the country. His government examines his constructions, abandons them\r\nif wrong, insists on them if right, and the case then becomes a matter of\r\nnegotiation between the two nations. Mr. Genet, however, assumes a new\r\nand bolder line of conduct. After deciding for himself ultimately, and\r\nwithout respect to the authority of the country, he proceeds to do what\r\neven his sovereign could not authorize, to put himself within the country\r\non a line with its government, to act as co-sovereign of the territory; he\r\narms vessels, levies men, gives commissions of war, independently of them,\r\nand in direct opposition to their orders and efforts. When the government\r\nforbids their citizens to arm and engage in the war, he undertakes to arm\r\nand engage them. When they forbid vessels to be fitted in their ports\r\nfor cruising on nations with whom they are at peace, he commissions\r\nthem to fit and cruise. When they forbid an unceded jurisdiction to be\r\nexercised within their territory by foreign agents, he undertakes to\r\nuphold that exercise, and to avow it openly. The privateers Citoyen Genet\r\nand Sans Culottes having been fitted out at Charleston (though without the\r\npermission of the government, yet before it was forbidden) the President\r\nonly required they might leave our ports, and did not interfere with their\r\nprizes. Instead, however, of their quitting our ports, the Sans Culottes\r\nremains still, strengthening and equipping herself, and the Citoyen\r\nGenet went out only to cruise on our coast, and to brave the authority\r\nof the country by returning into port again with her prizes. Though in\r\nthe letter of June the 5th, the final determination of the President was\r\ncommunicated, that no future armaments in our ports should be permitted,\r\nthe Vainqueur de La Bastille was afterwards equipped and commissioned in\r\nCharleston, the Anti-George in Savannah, the Carmagnole in Delaware, a\r\nschooner and a sloop in Boston, and the Polly or Republican was attempted\r\nto be equipped in New York, and was the subject of reclamation by Mr.\r\nGenet, in a style which certainly did not look like relinquishing the\r\npractice. The Little Sarah or Little Democrat was armed, equipped and\r\nmanned, in the port of Philadelphia, under the very eye of the government,\r\nas if meant to insult it. Having fallen down the river, and being\r\nevidently on the point of departure for a cruise, Mr. Genet was desired\r\nin my letter of July the 12th, on the part of the President, to detain\r\nher till some inquiry and determination on the case should be had. Yet\r\nwithin three or four days after, she was sent out by orders from Mr. Genet\r\nhimself, and is, at this time, cruising on our coasts, as appears by the\r\nprotest of the master of one of our vessels maltreated by her.\r\n\r\nThe government thus insulted and set at defiance by Mr. Genet, and\r\ncommitted in its duties and engagements to others, determined still to\r\nsee in these proceedings but the character of the individual, and not to\r\nbelieve, and it does not believe, that they are by instructions from his\r\nemployers. They had assured the British minister here, that the vessels\r\nalready armed to our ports should be obliged to leave them, and that no\r\nmore should be armed in them. Yet more had been armed, and those before\r\narmed had either not gone away, or gone only to return with new prizes.\r\nThey now informed him that the order for departure should be enforced,\r\nand the prizes made contrary to it should be restored or compensated. The\r\nsame thing was notified to Mr. Genet in my letter of August the 7th, and\r\nthat he might not conclude the promise of compensation to be of no concern\r\nto him, and go on in his courses, he was reminded that it would be a fair\r\narticle of account against his nation.\r\n\r\nMr. Genet, not content with using our force, whether we will or not, in\r\nthe military line against nations with whom we are at peace, undertakes\r\nalso to direct the civil government; and particularly for the executive\r\nand legislative bodies, to pronounce what powers may or may not be\r\nexercised by the one or the other. Thus, in his letter of June the 8th,\r\nhe promises to respect the political opinions of the President, _till\r\nthe Representatives shall have confirmed or rejected them_; as if the\r\nPresident had undertaken to decide what belonged to the decision of\r\nCongress. In his letter of June the 4th, he says more openly, that the\r\nPresident ought not to have taken on himself to decide on the subject\r\nof the letter, but that it was of importance enough to have consulted\r\nCongress thereon; and in that of June the 22d, he tells the President\r\nin direct terms, that Congress ought already to have been occupied on\r\ncertain questions which he had been too hasty in deciding; thus making\r\nhimself, and not the President, the judge of the powers ascribed by the\r\nConstitution to the executive, and dictating to him the occasion when he\r\nshould exercise the power of convening Congress at an earlier day than\r\ntheir own act had prescribed.\r\n\r\nOn the following expressions, no commentary shall be made:\r\n\r\nJuly 9. \"Les principes philosophiques proclamées par le Président.\"\r\n\r\nJune 22. \"Les opinions privées ou publiques de M. le President, et cette\r\négide ne paroissant, pas suffisante.\"\r\n\r\nJune 22. \"Le gouvernement fédéral s'est empressé, poussé par je ne scais\r\nquelle influence.\"\r\n\r\nJune 22. \"Je ne puis attribuer, des démarches de cette nature qu'à des\r\nimpressions étrangéres dont le tems et la vérité triompheront.\"\r\n\r\nJune 25. \"On poursuit avec acharnement, en vertu des instructions de M. le\r\nPrésident, les armateurs Français.\"\r\n\r\nJune 14. \"Ce réfus tend à accomplir le système infernal du roi\r\nd'Angleterre, et des autres rois ses accomplices, pour faire périr par la\r\nfamine les Républicains Français avec la liberte.\"\r\n\r\nJune 8. \"La lache abandon de ses amis.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 25. \"En vain le désir de conserver la paix fait-il sacrifier les\r\nintérêts de la France à cet intérêt, du moment; en vain le soif des\r\nrichesses l'emporte-t-elle sur l'honneur dans la balance politique de\r\nl'Amerique. Tous ces ménagemens, toute cette condescendance, toute cette\r\nhumilité n'aboutissent à rien; nos ennemis on rient, et les Français trop\r\nconfiants sont punis pour avoir cru que la nation Americaine, avoit un\r\npavillon, qu'elle avoit quelque égard pour ses loix, quelque conviction\r\nde ses forces, et qu'elle tenoit au sentiment de sa dignité. Il ne m'est\r\npas possible de peindre toute ma sensibilité sur ce scandale qui tend à la\r\ndiminution de votre commerce, à l'oppression du notre, et à l'abaissement,\r\nà l'avilissement des republiques. Si nos concitoyens ont été trompés, si\r\nvous n'êtes point en état de soutenir la souveraineté de votre peuple,\r\nparlez; nous l'avons garantié quand nous étions esclaves, nous saurons la\r\nrendre redoubtable étant devenus libres.\"\r\n\r\nWe draw a veil over the sensations which these expressions excite. No\r\nwords can render them; but they will not escape the sensibility of a\r\nfriendly and magnanimous nation, who will do us justice. We see in them\r\nneither the portrait of ourselves, nor the pencil of our friends; but\r\nan attempt to embroil both; to add still another nation to the enemies\r\nof his country, and to draw on both a reproach, which it is hoped will\r\nnever stain the history of either. The written proofs, of which Mr. Genet\r\nhimself was the bearer, were too unequivocal to leave a doubt that the\r\nFrench nation are constant in their friendship to us. The resolves of\r\ntheir National Convention, the letters of their Executive Council, attest\r\nthis truth, in terms which render it necessary to seek in some other\r\nhypothesis the solution of Mr. Genet's machinations against our peace and\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nConscious, on our part, of the same friendly and sincere dispositions, we\r\ncan with truth affirm, both for our nation and government, that we have\r\nnever omitted a reasonable occasion of manifesting them. For I will not\r\nconsider as of that character, opportunities of sallying forth from our\r\nports to waylay, rob and murder defenceless merchants and others, who have\r\ndone us no injury, and who were coming to trade with us in the confidence\r\nof our peace and amity. The violation of all the laws of order and\r\nmorality which bind mankind together, would be an unacceptable offering to\r\na just nation. Recurring then only to recent things, after so afflicting a\r\nlibel, we recollect with satisfaction, that in the course of two years, by\r\nunceasing exertions, we paid up seven years' arrearages and instalments of\r\nour debt to France, which the inefficiency of our first form of government\r\nhad suffered to be accumulating; that pressing on still to the entire\r\nfulfilment of our engagements, we have facilitated to Mr. Genet the effect\r\nof the instalments of the present year, to enable him to send relief to\r\nhis fellow citizens in France, threatened with famine; that in the first\r\nmoment of the insurrection which threatened the colony of St. Domingo,\r\nwe stepped forward to their relief with arms and money, taking freely\r\non ourselves the risk of an unauthorized aid, when delay would have been\r\ndenial; that we have received according to our best abilities the wretched\r\nfugitives from the catastrophe of the principal town of that colony, who,\r\nescaping from the swords and flames of civil war, threw themselves on us\r\nnaked and houseless, without food or friends, money or other means, their\r\nfaculties lost and absorbed in the depth of their distresses; that the\r\nexclusive admission to sell here the prizes made by France on her enemies,\r\nin the present war, though unstipulated in our treaties, and unfounded in\r\nher own practice, or in that of other nations, as we believe; the spirit\r\nmanifested by the late grand jury in their proceedings against those\r\nwho had aided the enemies of France with arms and implements of war, the\r\nexpressions of attachment to his nation, with which Mr. Genet was welcomed\r\non his arrival and journey from south to north, and our long forbearance\r\nunder his gross usurpations and outrages of the laws and authority of\r\nour country, do not bespeak the partialities intimated in his letters.\r\nAnd for these things he rewards us by endeavors to excite discord and\r\ndistrust between our citizens and those whom they have entrusted with\r\ntheir government, between the different branches of our government,\r\nbetween our nation and his. But none of these things, we hope, will be\r\nfound in his power. That friendship which dictates to us to bear with his\r\nconduct yet a while, lest the interests of his nation here should suffer\r\ninjury, will hasten them to replace an agent whose dispositions are such\r\na misrepresentation of theirs, and whose continuance here is inconsistent\r\nwith order, peace, respect, and that friendly correspondence which we hope\r\nwill ever subsist between the two nations. His government will see too\r\nthat the case is pressing. That it is impossible for two sovereign and\r\nindependent authorities to be going on within our territory at the same\r\ntime without collision. They will foresee that if Mr. Genet perseveres in\r\nhis proceedings, the consequences would be so hazardous to us, the example\r\nso humiliating and pernicious, that we may be forced even to suspend his\r\nfunctions before a successor can arrive to continue them. If our citizens\r\nhave not already been shedding each other's blood, it is not owing to the\r\nmoderation of Mr. Genet, but to the forbearance of the government. It is\r\nwell known that if the authority of the laws had been resorted to, to stop\r\nthe Little Democrat, its officers and agents were to have been resisted\r\nby the crew of the vessel, consisting partly of American citizens. Such\r\nevents are too serious, too possible, to be left to hazard, or to what is\r\nmore than hazard, the will of an agent whose designs are so mysterious.\r\n\r\nLay the case then immediately before his government. Accompany it with\r\nassurances, which cannot be stronger than true, that our friendship for\r\nthe nation is constant and unabating; that, faithful to our treaties, we\r\nhave fulfilled them in every point to the best of our understanding; that\r\nif in anything, however, we have construed them amiss, we are ready to\r\nenter into candid explanations, and to do whatever we can be convinced\r\nis right; that in opposing the extravagances of an agent, whose character\r\nthey seem not sufficiently to have known, we have been urged by motives of\r\nduty to ourselves and justice to others, which cannot but be approved by\r\nthose who are just themselves; and finally, that after independence and\r\nself-government, there is nothing we more sincerely wish than perpetual\r\nfriendship with them.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.[1]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [1] [A copy of the preceding letter was sent, enclosed by the\r\n        Secretary of State, to Mr. Genet.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DUKE AND CO.\r\n\r\n                                             PHILADELPHIA, August 21, 1793.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--Complaint having been made to the government of the United\r\nStates of some instances of unjustifiable vexation and spoliation\r\ncommitted on our merchant vessels by the privateers of the powers at war,\r\nand it being possible that other instances may have happened of which no\r\ninformation has been given to the government, I have it in charge from\r\nthe President to assure the merchants of the United States concerned\r\nin foreign commerce or navigation, that due attention will be paid to\r\nany injuries they may suffer on the high seas, or in foreign countries,\r\ncontrary to the law of nations, or to existing treaties, and that on\r\nthe forwarding hither well-authenticated evidence of the same, proper\r\nproceedings will be adopted for their relief. The just and friendly\r\ndispositions of the several belligerent powers afford well-founded\r\nexpectation that they will not hesitate to take effectual measures for\r\nrestraining their armed vessels from committing aggressions and vexations\r\non our citizens or their property.\r\n\r\nThere being no particular portion or description of the mercantile body\r\npointed out by the law for receiving communications of this nature, I take\r\nthe liberty of addressing it to the merchants of Savannah for the State\r\nof Georgia, and of requesting that through them it may be made known to\r\nall those of their State whom it may concern. Information will be freely\r\nreceived either from the individuals aggrieved or from any associations of\r\nmerchants who will be pleased to take the trouble of giving it in a case\r\nso interesting to themselves and their country.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Gentlemen, your most obedient\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                           August 25, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--You will perceive by the enclosed papers that Genet has thrown\r\ndown the gauntlet to the President by the publication of his letter and\r\nmy answer, and is himself forcing that appeal to the people, and risking\r\nthat disgust which I had so much wished should have been avoided. The\r\nindications from different parts of the continent are already sufficient\r\nto show that the mass of the republican interest has no hesitation to\r\ndisapprove of this intermeddling by a foreigner, and the more readily as\r\nhis object was evidently, contrary to his professions, to force us into\r\nthe war. I am not certain whether some of the more furious republicans may\r\nnot schismatize with him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                         September 1, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--My last was of the 25th, since that I have received yours of the\r\n20th, and Col. M's of the 21st. Nothing further has passed with Mr.\r\nGenet, but one of his consuls has committed a pretty serious deed at\r\nBoston, by going with an armed force taken from a French frigate in the\r\nharbor, and rescuing a vessel out of the hands of the marshal who had\r\narrested her by process from a court of justice; in another instance\r\nhe kept off the marshal by an armed force from serving a process on a\r\nvessel. He is ordered, consequently, to be arrested himself, prosecuted\r\nand punished for the rescue, and his exequatur will be revoked. You will\r\nsee in the newspapers the attack made on our commerce by the British king\r\nin his _additional instruction_ of June 8. Though we have only newspaper\r\ninformation of it, _provisional_ instructions are going to Mr. Pinckney\r\nto require a revocation of them, and indemnification for all losses which\r\nindividuals may sustain by them in the meantime. Of the revocation I have\r\nnot the least expectation. I shall therefore be for laying the whole\r\nbusiness (respecting both nations) before Congress. While I think it\r\nimpossible they should not approve of what has been done disagreeable to\r\nthe friendly nation, it will be in their power to soothe them by strong\r\ncommercial retaliation against the hostile one. Pinching their commerce\r\nwill be just against themselves, advantageous to us, and conciliatory\r\ntowards our friends of the hard necessities into which their agent has\r\ndrawn us. His conduct has given room for the enemies of liberty and of\r\nFrance, to come forward in a state of acrimony against that nation, which\r\nthey never would have dared to have done. The disapprobation of the agent\r\nmingles with the reprehension of his nation, and gives a toleration to\r\nthat which it never had before. He has still some defenders in Freneau,\r\nand Greenlief's paper, and who they are I know not: for even Hutcheson and\r\nDallas give him up. I enclose you a Boston paper, which will give you a\r\nspecimen of what all the papers are now filled with. You will recognize\r\nMr. A---- under the signature of Camillus. He writes in every week's\r\npaper, and generally under different names. This is the first in which\r\nhe has omitted some furious incartade against me. Hutcheson says that\r\nGenet has totally overturned the republican interest in Philadelphia.\r\nHowever, the people going right themselves, if they always see their\r\nrepublican advocates with them, an accidental meeting with the monocrats\r\nwill not be a coalescence. You will see much said, and again said, about\r\nG.'s threat to appeal to the people. I can assure you it is a fact. I\r\nreceived yesterday the MS. you mentioned to me from F----n. I have only\r\ngot a dozen pages into it, and never was more charmed with anything.\r\nProfound arguments presented in the simplest point of view entitle him\r\nreally to his ancient signature. In the papers received from you, I have\r\nseen nothing which ought to be changed, except a part of one sentence\r\nnot necessary for its object, and running foul of something of which you\r\nwere not apprized. A malignant fever has been generated in the filth of\r\nWater street, which gives great alarm. About 70 people had died of it two\r\ndays ago, and as many more were ill of it. It has now got into most parts\r\nof the city, and is considerably infectious. At first 3 out of 4 died,\r\nnow about 1 out of 3. It comes on with a pain in the head, sick stomach,\r\nthen a little chill, fever, black vomiting and stools, and death from the\r\n2d to the 8th day. Everybody who can, is flying from the city, and the\r\npanic of the country people is likely to add famine to disease. Though\r\nbecoming less mortal, it is still spreading, and the heat of the weather\r\nis very unpropitious. I have withdrawn my daughter from the city, but am\r\nobliged to go to it every day myself. My threshing machine has arrived at\r\nNew York. Mr. Pinckney writes me word that the original from which this\r\nmodel is copied, threshes 150 bushels of wheat in 8 hours, with 6 horses\r\nand 5 men. It may be moved either by water or horses. Fortunately the\r\nworkman who made it (a millwright) is come in the same vessel to settle in\r\nAmerica. I have written to persuade him to go on immediately to Richmond,\r\noffering him the use of my model to exhibit, and to give him letters to\r\nget him into immediate employ in making them. I expect an answer before I\r\nwrite to you again. I understand that the model is made mostly in brass,\r\nand in the simple form in which it was first ordered, to be worked by\r\nhorses. It was to have cost 5 guineas, but Mr. Pinckney having afterwards\r\ndirected it to be accommodated to water movement also, it has made it\r\nmore complicated, and costs 13 guineas. It will thresh any grain from the\r\nWindsor bean down to the smallest. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GORE.\r\n\r\n                                          PHILADELPHIA,  September 2, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The President is informed through the channel of a letter from\r\nyourself to Mr. Lear, that M. Duplaine, consul of France at Boston, has\r\nlately, with an armed force, seized and rescued a vessel from the officer\r\nof a court of justice, by process from which she was under arrest in his\r\ncustody: and that he has in like manner, with an armed force, opposed\r\nand prevented the officer, charged with process from a court against\r\nanother vessel, from serving that process. This daring violation of the\r\nlaws requires the more attention, as it is by a foreigner clothed with a\r\npublic character, arrogating an unfounded right to admiralty jurisdiction,\r\nand probably meaning to assert it by this act of force. You know that by\r\nthe law of nations, consuls are not diplomatic characters, and have no\r\nimmunities whatever against the laws of the land. To put this altogether\r\nout of dispute, a clause was inserted in our consular convention\r\nwith France, making them amenable to the laws of the land, as other\r\ninhabitants. Consequently, M. Duplaine is liable to arrest, imprisonment,\r\nand other punishments, even capital, as other foreign subjects resident\r\nhere. The President therefore desires that you will immediately institute\r\nsuch a prosecution against him, as the laws will warrant. If there be any\r\ndoubt as to the character of his offence, whether of a higher or lower\r\ngrade, it will be best to prosecute for that which will admit the least\r\ndoubt, because an acquittal, though it might be founded merely on the\r\nopinion that the grade of offence with which he is _charged_ is higher\r\nthan his _act_ would support, yet it might be construed by the uninformed\r\nto be a judiciary decision against his amenability to the law, or perhaps\r\nin favor of the jurisdiction these consuls are assuming. The process\r\ntherefore, should be of the surest kind, and all the proceedings well\r\ngrounded. In particular, if an arrest, as is probable, be the first step,\r\nit should be so managed as to leave room neither for escape nor rescue.\r\nIt should be attended with every mark of respect, consistent with safe\r\ncustody, and his confinement as mild and comfortable also, as that would\r\npermit. These are the distinctions to which a consul is entitled, that is\r\nto say, of a particular decorum of deportment towards him, indicative of\r\nrespect to the sovereign whose officer he is.\r\n\r\nThe President also desires you will immediately obtain the best evidence\r\nit shall be in your power to procure, under oath or affirmation, of the\r\ntransaction stated in your letter, and that in this, you consider yourself\r\nas acting as much on behalf of M. Duplaine as the public, the candid\r\ntruth of the case being exactly that which is desired, as it may be the\r\nfoundation of an act, the justice of which should be beyond all question.\r\nThis evidence I shall be glad to receive within as few days, or even\r\nhours, of delay as possible.\r\n\r\nI am also instructed to ask the favor of you to communicate copies of any\r\nmemorials, representations or other written correspondence which may have\r\npassed between the Governor and yourself, with respect to the privateers\r\nand prizes which have been the subject of your letters to Mr. Lear.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, September 5, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am honored with yours of August the 30th. Mine of the 7th of that\r\nmonth assured you that measures were taking for excluding from all further\r\nasylum in our ports, vessels armed in them to cruise on nations with which\r\nwe are at peace, and for the restoration of the prizes, the Lovely Lass,\r\nPrince William Henry, and the Jane of Dublin, and that should the measures\r\nfor restitution fail in their effect, the President considers it as\r\nincumbent on the United States, to make compensation for the vessels.\r\n\r\nWe are bound by our treaties with three of the belligerent nations,\r\n_by all the means in our power_ to protect and defend their vessels and\r\neffects in our ports or waters, or on the seas near our shores, and to\r\nrecover and restore the same to the right owners, when taken from them. If\r\nall the means in our power are used, and fail in their effect, we are not\r\nbound by our treaties with those nations to make compensation.\r\n\r\nThough we have no similar treaty with Great Britain, it was the opinion of\r\nthe President that we should use towards that nation the same rule which,\r\nunder this article, was to govern us with the other nations; and even to\r\nextend it to captures made on _the high seas_ and brought into our ports,\r\nif done by vessels which had been armed within them.\r\n\r\nHaving, for particular reasons, forborne to use _all the measures in our\r\npower_ for the restitution of the three vessels mentioned in my letter of\r\nAugust the 7th, the President thought it incumbent on the United States\r\nto make compensation for them; and though nothing was said in that letter\r\nof other vessels taken under like circumstances, and brought in after\r\nthe 5th of June and _before the date of that letter_, yet where the same\r\nforbearance had taken place, it was and is his opinion that compensation\r\nwould be equally due.\r\n\r\nAs to prizes made under the same circumstances, and brought in _after the\r\ndate of that letter_, the President determined that all the means in our\r\npower should be used for their restitution. If these fail us, as we should\r\nnot be bound by our treaties to make compensation to the other powers, in\r\nthe analogous case, he did not mean to give an opinion that it ought to be\r\ndone to Great Britain. But still, if any cases shall arise subsequent to\r\nthat date, the circumstances of which shall place them on similar ground\r\nwith those before it, the President would think compensation equally\r\nincumbent on the United States.\r\n\r\nInstructions are given to the Governors of the different States, to\r\nuse all the means in their power for restoring prizes of this last\r\ndescription, found within their ports. Though they will, of course, take\r\nmeasures to be informed of them, and the General Government has given\r\nthem the aid of the Custom House officers for this purpose, yet you\r\nwill be sensible of the importance of multiplying the channels of their\r\ninformation, as far as shall depend on yourself or any person under your\r\ndirection, in order that the government may use the means in their power,\r\nfor making restitution. Without knowledge of the capture, they cannot\r\nrestore it. It will always be best to give the notice to them directly;\r\nbut any information which you shall be pleased to send to me also, at any\r\ntime, shall be forwarded to them as quickly as the distance will permit.\r\n\r\nHence you will perceive, Sir, that the President contemplates restitution\r\nor _compensation_, in the cases _before_ the seventh of August, and,\r\n_after_ that date, _restitution_, if it can be effected by any means in\r\nour power; and that it will be important that you should substantiate the\r\nfact that such prizes are in our ports or waters.\r\n\r\nYour list of the privateers illicitly armed in our ports, is, I believe,\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nWith respect to losses by detention, waste, spoliation, sustained by\r\nvessels taken as before mentioned between the dates of June the 5th\r\nand August the 7th, it is proposed, as a provisional measure, that the\r\ncollector of the customs of the district, and the British consul, or any\r\nother person you please, shall appoint persons to establish the value of\r\nthe vessel and cargo, at the times of her capture and of her arrival in\r\nthe port into which she is brought, according to their value in that port.\r\nIf this shall be agreeable to you, and you will be pleased to signify it\r\nto me, with the names of the prizes understood to be of this description,\r\ninstructions will be given accordingly, to the collectors of the customs\r\nwhere the respective vessels are.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, September 7, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--We have received, through a channel which cannot be considered as\r\nauthentic, the copy of a paper, styled \"Additional Instructions to the\r\nCommanders of his Majesty's Ships of War and Privateers,\" &c., dated\r\nat St. James's, June 8, 1793. If this paper be authentic, I have little\r\ndoubt but that you will have taken measures to forward it to me. But as\r\nyour communication of it may miscarry, and time in the mean will be lost,\r\nit has been thought better that it should be supposed authentic; that on\r\nthat supposition I should notice to you its very exceptionable nature, and\r\nthe necessity of obtaining explanations on the subject from the British\r\ngovernment; desiring at the same time, that you will consider this letter\r\nas provisionally written only, and as if never written, in the event that\r\nthe paper which is the occasion of it be not genuine.\r\n\r\nThe first article of it permits all vessels, laden wholly or in part\r\nwith corn, flour or meal, bound to any port in France, to be stopped and\r\nsent into any British port, to be purchased by that government, or to\r\nbe released only on the condition of security given by the master, that\r\nhe will proceed to dispose of his cargo in the ports of some country _in\r\namity with his Majesty_.\r\n\r\nThis article is so manifestly contrary to the law of nations, that nothing\r\nmore would seem necessary than to observe that it is so. Reason and usage\r\nhave established that when two nations go to war, those who choose to\r\nlive in peace retain their natural right to pursue their agriculture,\r\nmanufactures, and other ordinary vocations, to carry the produce of their\r\nindustry for exchange to all nations, belligerent or neutral, as usual,\r\nto go and come freely without injury or molestation, and in short, that\r\nthe war among others shall be, for them, as if it did not exist. One\r\nrestriction on their natural rights has been submitted to by nations at\r\npeace, that is to say, that of not furnishing to either party implements\r\nmerely of war for the annoyance of the other, nor anything whatever to a\r\nplace blockaded by its enemy. What these implements of war are, has been\r\nso often agreed and is so well understood as to leave little question\r\nabout them at this day. There does not exist, perhaps, a nation in our\r\ncommon hemisphere, which has not made a particular enumeration of them in\r\nsome or all of their treaties, under the name of contraband. It suffices\r\nfor the present occasion, to say, that corn, flour and meal, are not\r\nof the class of contraband, and consequently remain articles of free\r\ncommerce. A culture which, like that of the soil, gives employment to such\r\na proportion of mankind, could never be suspended by the whole earth, or\r\ninterrupted for them, whenever any two nations should think proper to go\r\nto war.\r\n\r\nThe state of war then existing between Great Britain and France, furnishes\r\nno legitimate right either to interrupt the agriculture of the United\r\nStates, or the peaceable exchange of its produce with all nations; and\r\nconsequently, the assumption of it will be as lawful hereafter as now, in\r\npeace as in war. No ground, acknowledged by the common reason of mankind,\r\nauthorizes this act now, and unacknowledged ground may be taken at any\r\ntime, and at all times. We see then a practice begun, to which no time,\r\nno circumstances prescribe any limits, and which strikes at the root of\r\nour agriculture, that branch of industry which gives food, clothing and\r\ncomfort to the great mass of the inhabitants of these States. If any\r\nnation whatever has a right to shut up to our produce all the ports of\r\nthe earth except her own and those of her friends, she may shut up these\r\nalso, and so confine us within our own limits. No nation can subscribe\r\nto such pretensions; no nation can agree, at the mere will or interest\r\nof another, to have its peaceable industry suspended, and its citizens\r\nreduced to idleness and want. The loss of our produce destined for foreign\r\nmarkets, or that loss which would result from an arbitrary restraint of\r\nour markets, is a tax too serious for us to acquiesce in. It is not enough\r\nfor a nation to say, we and our friends will buy your produce. We have a\r\nright to answer, that it suits us better to sell to their enemies as well\r\nas their friends. Our ships do not go to France to return empty. They go\r\nto exchange the surplus of one produce which we can spare, for surplusses\r\nof other kinds which they can spare and we want; which they can furnish on\r\nbetter terms, and more to our mind, than Great Britain or her friends. We\r\nhave a right to judge for ourselves what market best suits us, and they\r\nhave none to forbid to us the enjoyment of the necessaries and comforts\r\nwhich we may obtain from any other independent country.\r\n\r\nThis act, too, tends directly to draw us from that state of peace in which\r\nwe are wishing to remain. It is an essential character of neutrality to\r\nfurnish no aids (not stipulated by treaty) to one party, which we are\r\nnot equally ready to furnish to the other. If we permit corn to be sent\r\nto Great Britain and her friends, we are equally bound to permit it to\r\nFrance. To restrain it would be a partiality which might lead to war with\r\nFrance; and between restraining it ourselves, and permitting her enemies\r\nto restrain it unrightfully, is no difference. She would consider this as\r\na mere pretext, of which she would not be the dupe; and on what honorable\r\nground could we otherwise explain it? Thus we should see ourselves plunged\r\nby this unauthorized act of Great Britain into a war with which we meddle\r\nnot, and which we wish to avoid if justice to all parties and from all\r\nparties will enable us to avoid it. In the case where we found ourselves\r\nobliged by treaty to withhold from the enemies of France the right of\r\narming in our ports, we thought ourselves in justice bound to withhold the\r\nsame right from France also, and we did it. Were we to withhold from her\r\nsupplies of provisions, we should in like manner be bound to withhold them\r\nfrom her enemies also; and thus shut to ourselves all the ports of Europe\r\nwhere corn is in demand, or make ourselves parties in the war. This is a\r\ndilemma which Great Britain has no right to force upon us, and for which\r\nno pretext can be found in any part of our conduct. She may, indeed, feel\r\nthe desire of starving an enemy nation; but she can have no right of doing\r\nit at our loss, nor of making us the instruments of it.\r\n\r\nThe President therefore desires, that you will immediately enter into\r\nexplanations on this subject with the British government. Lay before\r\nthem in friendly and temperate terms all the demonstrations of the injury\r\ndone us by this act, and endeavor to obtain a revocation of it, and full\r\nindemnification to any citizens of these States who may have suffered by\r\nit in the meantime. Accompany your representations by every assurance of\r\nour earnest desire to live on terms of the best friendship and harmony\r\nwith them, and to found our expectations of justice on their part, on a\r\nstrict observance of it on ours.\r\n\r\nIt is with concern, however, I am obliged to observe, that so marked has\r\nbeen the inattention of the British court to every application which has\r\nbeen made to them on any subject, by this government, (not a single answer\r\nI believe having ever been given to one of them, except in the act of\r\nexchanging a minister) that it may become unavoidable, in certain cases,\r\nwhere an answer of some sort is necessary, to consider their silence as\r\nan answer. Perhaps this is their intention. Still, however, desirous of\r\nfurnishing no color of offence, we do not wish you to name to them any\r\nterm for giving an answer. Urge one as much as you can without commitment,\r\nand on the first day of December be so good as to give us information\r\nof the state in which this matter is, that it may be received during the\r\nsession of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe second article of the same instruction allows the armed vessels\r\nof Great Britain to seize for condemnation all vessels, on their first\r\nattempt to enter a blockaded port, except those of Denmark and Sweden,\r\nwhich are to be prevented only, but not seized, on their first attempt. Of\r\nthe nations inhabiting the shores of the Atlantic ocean, and practising\r\nits navigation, Denmark, Sweden and the United States alone are neutral.\r\nTo declare then all _neutral_ vessels (for as to the vessels of the\r\n_belligerent_ powers no order was necessary) to be legal prize, which\r\nshall attempt to enter a blockaded port, except those of _Denmark and\r\nSweden_, is exactly to declare _that the vessels of the United States_\r\nshall be lawful prize, and those of Denmark and Sweden shall not. It\r\nis of little consequence that the article has avoided naming the United\r\nStates, since it has used a description applicable to them, and to them\r\nalone, while it exempts the others from its operation by name. You will be\r\npleased to ask an explanation of this distinction; and you will be able to\r\nsay, in discussing its justice, that in every circumstance, we treat Great\r\nBritain on the footing of the most favored nation where our treaties do\r\nnot preclude us, and that even these are just as favorable to her, as hers\r\nare to us. Possibly she may be bound by treaty to admit this exception in\r\nfavor of Denmark and Sweden. But she cannot be bound by treaty to withhold\r\nit from us. And if it be withheld merely because not established with us\r\nby treaty, what might not we, on the same ground, have withheld from Great\r\nBritain during the short course of the present war, as well as the peace\r\nwhich preceded it?\r\n\r\nWhether these explanations with the British government shall be verbal or\r\nin writing, is left to yourself. Verbal communications are very insecure;\r\nfor it is only to deny them or to change their terms, in order to do\r\naway their effect at any time. Those in writing have as many and obvious\r\nadvantages, and ought to be preferred, unless there be obstacles of which\r\nwe are not apprized.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                         September 8, 1793.\r\n\r\nI have received and am charmed with No. 5. I thought the introduction\r\nan useful lesson to others as I found it to myself, for I had really,\r\nby constantly hearing the sound, been led into a pretty free use of it\r\nmyself. I struck out the passage you desired in the page. I struck out\r\nalso the words \"and neutrality\" in the following passage, \"taking the\r\nproclamation _in its proper sense_ as reminding all concerned, that as the\r\nUnited States were at peace, the laws of peace _and neutrality_ were still\r\nobligatory,\" also a paragraph of four lines that a minister from France\r\nwas hourly expected when the proclamation issued. There was one here at\r\nthe time; the other did not arrive in six weeks. To have waited that time\r\nshould have given full course to the evil.\r\n\r\nI went through Franklin with enchantment; and what peculiarly pleased\r\nme was, that there was not a sentence from which it could be conjectured\r\nwhether it came from north, south, east or west. At last a whole page of\r\nVirginia flashed on me. It was in the section on the state of parties,\r\nand was an apology for the continuance of slavery among us. However, this\r\ncircumstance may be justly palliated, it had nothing to do with the state\r\nof parties, with the bank, encumbered a good cause with a questionable\r\nargument. Many readers who would have gone heart and hand with the author\r\nso far, would have flown off in a tangent from that paragraph. I struck\r\nit out. Justify this if you please to those concerned, and if it cannot\r\nbe done, say so, and it may still be re-established. I mentioned to you\r\nin my last that a French consul at Boston had rescued a vessel out of the\r\nhands of a Marshal by military force. Genet has, at New York, forbidden\r\na Marshal to arrest a vessel, and given orders to the French squadron to\r\nprotect her by force. Was there ever an instance before of a diplomatic\r\nman overawing and obstructing the course of the law in a country by an\r\narmed force? The yellow fever increases. The week before last about three\r\na day died. This last week about eleven a day have died; consequently,\r\nfrom known data about thirty-three a day are taken, and there are about\r\nthree hundred and thirty patients under it. They are much scattered\r\nthrough the town, and it is the opinion of the physicians that there is\r\nno possibility of stopping it. They agree it is a nondescript disease, and\r\nno two agree in any one part of their process of cure. The President goes\r\noff the day after to-morrow, as he had always intended. Knox then takes\r\nflight. Hamilton is ill of the fever, as is said. He had two physicians\r\nout at his house the night before last.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, September 9, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your two memorials of\r\nthe 4th and 6th instant, which have been duly laid before the President of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\nYou cannot be uninformed of the circumstances which have occasioned the\r\nFrench squadron now in New York to seek asylum in the ports of the United\r\nStates. Driven from those where they were on duty, by the superiority\r\nof the adverse party in the civil war which has so unhappily afflicted\r\nthe colonies of France, filled with the wretched fugitives from the same\r\nscenes of distress and desolation, without water or provisions for the\r\nshortest voyage, their vessels scarcely in a condition to keep the sea\r\nat all, they were forced to seek the nearest ports in which they could\r\nbe received and supplied with necessaries. That they have ever been out\r\nagain to cruise, is a fact we have never learned, and which we believe\r\nto be impossible, from the information received of their wants and other\r\nimpediments to active service. This case has been noted specially, to show\r\nthat no inconvenience can have been produced to the trade of the other\r\nbelligerent powers, by the presence of this fleet in our harbors. I shall\r\nnow proceed to more general ground.\r\n\r\nFrance, England and all other nations have a right to cruise on our\r\ncoasts; a right not derived from our permission, but from the law of\r\nnature. To render this more advantageous, France has secured to herself,\r\nby a treaty with us, (as she has done also by a treaty with Great Britain,\r\nin the event of a war with us or any other nation) two special rights.\r\n1. Admission for her prizes and privateers into our ports. This, by the\r\nseventeenth and twenty-second articles, is secured to her exclusively\r\nof her enemies, as is done for her in the like case by Great Britain,\r\nwere her present war with us instead of Great Britain. 2. Admission for\r\nher public vessels of war into our ports, in cases of stress of weather,\r\npirates, enemies, or other urgent necessity, to refresh, victual, repair,\r\n&c. This is not exclusive. As then we are bound by treaty to receive the\r\npublic armed vessels of France, and are not bound to exclude those of\r\nher enemies, the executive has never denied the same right of asylum in\r\nour ports to the public armed vessels of your nation. They, as well as\r\nthe French, are free to come into them in all cases of weather, piracies,\r\nenemies, or other urgent necessity, and to refresh, victual, repair, &c.\r\nAnd so many are these urgent necessities, to vessels far from their own\r\nports, that we have thought inquiries into the nature as well as the\r\ndegree of the necessities which drive them hither, as endless as they\r\nwould be fruitless, and therefore have not made them. And the rather,\r\nbecause there is a third right, secured to neither by treaty, but due to\r\nboth on the principles of hospitality between friendly nations, that of\r\ncoming into our ports, not _under the pressure of urgent necessity_, but\r\nwhenever their comfort or convenience induces them. On this ground, also,\r\nthe two nations are on a footing.\r\n\r\nAs it has never been conceived that either would detain their ships of\r\nwar in our ports when they were in a condition for action, we have never\r\nconceived it necessary to prescribe any limits to the time of their stay.\r\nNor can it be viewed as an injury to either party, to let their enemies\r\nlie still in our ports from year's end to year's end, if they choose\r\nit. Thus, then, the public ships of war of both nations enjoy a perfect\r\nequality in our ports; first, in cases of urgent necessity; secondly, in\r\ncases of comfort or convenience; and thirdly, in the time they choose to\r\ncontinue; and all a friendly power can ask from another is, to extend to\r\nher the same indulgences which she extends to other friendly powers. And\r\nthough the admission of the prizes and privateers of France is exclusive,\r\nyet it is the effect of treaty made long ago, for valuable considerations,\r\nnot with a view to the present circumstances, nor against any nation in\r\nparticular, but all in general, and may, therefore, be faithfully observed\r\nwithout offence to any; and we mean faithfully to observe it. The same\r\nexclusive article has been stipulated, as was before observed, by Great\r\nBritain in her treaty with France, and indeed is to be found in the\r\ntreaties between most nations.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the usurpation of admiralty jurisdiction by the consuls of\r\nFrance, within these States, the honor and rights of the States themselves\r\nwere sufficient motives for the executive to take measures to prevent its\r\ncontinuance, as soon as they were apprized of it. They have been led by\r\nparticular considerations to await the effect of these measures, believing\r\nthey would be sufficient; but finding at length they were not, such others\r\nhave been lately taken as can no longer fail to suppress this irregularity\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nThe President is duly sensible of the character of the act of opposition\r\nmade to the serving of legal process on the brig William Tell, and he\r\npresumes the representations made on that subject to the minister of\r\nFrance, will have the effect of opening a free access to the officer\r\nof justice, when he shall again present himself with the precept of his\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, September 9, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In my letter of June the 25th, on the subject of the ship William,\r\nand generally of vessels suggested to be taken within the limits of the\r\nprotection of the United States by the armed vessels of your nation, I\r\nundertook to assure you it would be more agreeable to the President, that\r\nsuch vessels should be detained under the orders of yourself or the consul\r\nof France, than by a military guard, until the government of the United\r\nStates should be able to inquire into and decide on the fact. In two\r\nseparate letters of the 29th of the same month, I had the honor to inform\r\nyou of the claims lodged with the executive for the same ship William and\r\nthe brig Fanny, to enclose you the evidence on which they were founded,\r\nand to desire that if you found it just, you would order the vessels to\r\nbe delivered to the owners; or, if overweighed in your judgment by any\r\ncontradictory evidence which you might have or acquire, you would do me\r\nthe favor to communicate that evidence; and that the consuls of France\r\nmight retain the vessels in their custody, in the meantime, until the\r\nexecutive of the United States should consider and decide finally on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nWhen that mode of proceeding was consented to for your satisfaction, it\r\nwas by no means imagined it would have occasioned such delays of justice\r\nto the individuals interested. The President is still without information,\r\neither that the vessels are restored, or that you have any evidence to\r\noffer as to the place of capture. I am, therefore, Sir, to repeat the\r\nrequest of early information on this subject, in order that if any injury\r\nhas been done those interested, it may be no longer aggravated by delay.\r\n\r\nThe intention of the letter of June the 25th having been to permit such\r\nvessels to remain in the custody of the consuls, instead of that of a\r\nmilitary guard (which, in the case of the ship William, appeared to have\r\nbeen disagreeable to you), the indulgence was of course to be understood\r\nas going only to cases which the executive might take, or keep possession\r\nof, with a military guard, and not to interfere with the authority of\r\nthe courts of justice in any case wherein they should undertake to act.\r\nMy letter of June the 29th, accordingly, in the same case of the ship\r\nWilliam, informed you that no power in this country could take a vessel\r\nout of the custody of the courts, and that it was only because they\r\ndecided not to take cognizance of that case, that it resulted to the\r\nexecutive to interfere in it. Consequently, this alone put it in their\r\npower to leave the vessel in the hands of the consul. The courts of\r\njustice exercise the sovereignty of this country in judiciary matters;\r\nare supreme in these, and liable neither to control nor opposition from\r\nany other branch of the government. We learn, however, from the enclosed\r\npaper, that the consul of New York, in the first instance, and yourself\r\nin a subsequent one, forbid an officer of justice to serve the process\r\nwith which he was charged from his court, on the British brig William\r\nTell, taken by a French armed vessel within a mile of our shores, as has\r\nbeen deposed on oath, and brought into New York, and that you had even\r\ngiven orders to the French squadron there to protect the vessel against\r\nany person who should attempt to take her from their custody. If this\r\nopposition were founded, as is there suggested, on the indulgence of the\r\nletters before cited, it was extending that to a case not within their\r\npurview; and even had it been precisely the case to which they were to be\r\napplied, is it possible to imagine you might assert it within the body of\r\nthe country by force of arms?\r\n\r\nI forbear to make the observations which such a measure must suggest, and\r\ncannot but believe that a moment's reflection will evince to you the depth\r\nof the error committed in this opposition to an officer of justice, and\r\nin the means proposed to be resorted to in support of it. I am therefore\r\ncharged to declare to you expressly, that the President expects and\r\nrequires that the officer of justice be not obstructed in freely and\r\npeaceably serving the process of his court, and that in the meantime the\r\nvessel and her cargo be not suffered to depart till the judiciary, if it\r\nwill undertake it, or himself if not, shall decide whether the seizure has\r\nbeen made within the limits of our protection.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. COXE.\r\n\r\n                                                        September 10, 1793.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson presents his compliments to Mr. Coxe. He directed a\r\ncensus to be sent him in the moment of receiving his note of the 5th. With\r\nrespect to the placing consuls in the British Islands, we are so far from\r\nbeing permitted that, that a common mercantile factor is not permitted by\r\ntheir laws. The experiment of establishing consuls in the colonies of the\r\nEuropean nations has been going on for some time, but as yet we cannot\r\nsay it has been formally and fully admitted by any. The French colonial\r\nauthority has received them, but they have never yet been confirmed by the\r\nnational authority.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MORRIS.\r\n\r\n                                          PHILADELPHIA, September 11, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My late letters to you have been of August 16, 23, and 26, and\r\na duplicate of the two first will accompany this. Yours lately received\r\nare April 4, 5, 11, 19, May 20, and June 1, being Nos. 26 to 31. I have\r\nlittle particulars to say to you by this opportunity which may be less\r\ncertain than the last.\r\n\r\nThe north-western Indians have refused to meet our commissioners, unless\r\nthey would agree to the Ohio as our boundary by way of preliminary\r\narticle; and this being impossible on account of the army locations\r\nand particular sales on that side the river, the war will go on. We may\r\nshortly expect to hear that General Wayne is in motion. An infectious\r\nand mortal fever is broke out in this place. The deaths under it the week\r\nbefore last were about forty, the last week about fifty, this week they\r\nwill probably be about two hundred, and it is increasing. Every one is\r\ngetting out of the city who can. Colonel Hamilton is ill of the fever, but\r\nis on the recovery. The President, according to an arrangement of some\r\ntime ago, set out for Mount Vernon on yesterday. The Secretary of War\r\nis setting out on a visit to Massachusetts. I shall go in a few days to\r\nVirginia. When we shall reassemble again may perhaps depend on the course\r\nof this malady, and on that may depend the date of my next letter.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great and sincere esteem and respect, dear\r\nSir, your most obedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                                        September 15, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The correspondence which has taken place between the Executive\r\nand yourself, and the acts which you have thought proper to do, and to\r\ncountenance, in opposition to the laws of the land, have rendered it\r\nnecessary, in the opinion of the President, to lay a faithful statement\r\nof them before the government of France, to explain to them the reasons\r\nand the necessity which have dictated our measures, to renew assurances\r\nof that sincere friendship which has suffered no intermission during the\r\ncourse of these proceedings, and to express our extreme anxiety that none\r\nmay be produced on their part. This has accordingly been directed to be\r\ndone by the Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States at Paris, in a\r\nletter, a copy of which I now enclose to you;[2] and, in order to bring to\r\nan end what cannot be permitted to continue, there could be no hesitation\r\nto declare in it the necessity of their having a representation here,\r\ndisposed to respect the laws and authorities of the country, and to do\r\nthe best for their interest which these would permit. An anxious regard\r\nfor those interests, and a desire that they may not suffer, will induce\r\nthe executive in the meantime to receive your communications in writing,\r\nand to admit the continuance of your functions so long as they shall be\r\nrestrained within the limits of the law, as heretofore announced to you,\r\nor shall be of the tenor usually observed towards independent nations by\r\nthe representative of a friendly power residing with them.\r\n\r\nThe President thought it respectful to your nation as well as yourself,\r\nto leave to yourself the restraining certain proceedings of the consuls\r\nof France within the United States, which you were informed were contrary\r\nto the laws of the land, and therefore not to be permitted. He has seen\r\nwith regret, however, that you have been far from restraining these\r\nproceedings, and that the duty has devolved on him of suppressing them\r\nby the authority of the country. I enclose to you the copy of a letter\r\nwritten to the several consuls and vice-consuls of France, warning them\r\nthat this will be done if any repetition of these acts shall render it\r\nnecessary. To the consul of France at Boston, no such letter has been\r\nwritten. A more serious fact is charged on him, which, if proved as there\r\nis reason to expect, will render the revocation of his Exequatur an act of\r\nimmediate duty.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [2] See p. 31.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, October 3, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In a former letter which I had the honor of writing you, I mentioned\r\nthat information had been received that M. Duplaine, vice-consul of\r\nFrance, at Boston, had been charged with an opposition to the laws of the\r\nland, of such a character, as if true would render it the duty of the\r\nPresident immediately to revoke the Exequatur, whereby he is permitted\r\nto exercise the functions of vice-consul in these United States. The\r\nfact has been since inquired into, and I now enclose you copies of the\r\nevidence establishing it; whereby you will perceive how inconsistent\r\nwith peace and order it would be, to permit, any longer, the exercise of\r\nfunctions in these United States by a person capable of mistaking their\r\nlegitimate extent so far, as to oppose, by force of arms, the course\r\nof the laws within the body of the country. The wisdom and justice of\r\nthe government of France, and their sense of the necessity in every\r\ngovernment, of preserving the course of the laws free and unobstructed,\r\nrender us confident that they will approve this necessary arrestation of\r\nthe proceedings of one of their agents; as we would certainly do in the\r\nlike case, were any consul or vice-consul of ours to oppose with an armed\r\nforce, the course of their laws within their own limits. Still, however,\r\nindispensable as this act has been, it is with the most lively concern,\r\nthe President has seen that the evil could not be arrested otherwise than\r\nby an appeal to the authority of the country.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great esteem and respect, your most obedient,\r\nand most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 17, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have carefully considered the question whether the President\r\nmay call Congress to any other place than that to which they have\r\nadjourned themselves, and think he cannot have such a right unless it\r\nhas been given him by the Constitution, or the laws, and that neither of\r\nthese has given it. The only circumstance which he can alter as to their\r\nmeeting, is that of _time_ by calling them at an _earlier day_ than that\r\nto which they stand adjourned, but no power to change the place is given.\r\nMr. Madison happened to come here yesterday, after the receipt of your\r\nletter. I proposed the question to him, and he thinks there was particular\r\ncaution intended and used in the direction of the Constitution, to avoid\r\ngiving the President any power over the place of meeting; lest he should\r\nexercise it with local partialities. With respect to the Executive, the\r\nResidence law has fixed our office at Philadelphia till the year 1800,\r\nand therefore it seems necessary that we should get as near them as we\r\nmay with safety. As to the place of meeting for the Legislature, were we\r\nauthorized to decide that question, I should think it right to have it\r\nin some place in Pennsylvania, in consideration of the principles of the\r\nResidence bill, and we might furnish no pretext to that state to infringe\r\nthem hereafter. I am quite unacquainted with Reading and its means of\r\naccommodation. Its situation is perhaps as little objectionable as that\r\nof Lancaster, and less so than Trenton or perhaps Wilmington. However, I\r\nthink we have nothing to do with the question, and that Congress must meet\r\nin Philadelphia, even if it be in the open fields, to adjourn themselves\r\nto some other place. I am extremely afraid something has happened to Mr.\r\nBankson, on whom I relied for continuance at my office. For two posts past\r\nI have not received any letter from him, nor dispatches of any kind. This\r\ninvolves new fears for the duplicates of those to Mr. Morris. I have the\r\nhonor to be, with sentiments of the most perfect esteem and attachment,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.[3]\r\n\r\n                                              GERMANTOWN, November 2, 1793.\r\n\r\nI overtook the President at Baltimore, and we arrived here yesterday,\r\nmyself fleeced of seventy odd dollars to get from Fredericksburg here, the\r\nstages running no further than Baltimore. I mention this to put yourself\r\nand Monroe on your guard. The fever in Philadelphia has so much abated as\r\nto have almost disappeared. The inhabitants are about returning. It has\r\nbeen determined that the President shall not interfere with the meeting\r\nof Congress. R. H. and K. were of opinion he had a right to call them\r\nto any place, but that the occasion did not call for it. I think the\r\nPresident inclined to the opinion. I proposed a proclamation notifying\r\nthat the Executive business would be done here till further notice,\r\nwhich I believe will be agreed. H. R. Lewis, Rawle &c., all concur in the\r\nnecessity that Congress should meet in Philadelphia, and vote there their\r\nown adjournment. If it shall then be necessary to change the place, the\r\nquestion will be between New York and Lancaster. The Pennsylvania members\r\nare very anxious for the latter, and will attend punctually to support\r\nit, as well as to support much for Muhlenburg, and oppose the appointment\r\nof Smith (S. C.) speaker, which is intended by the Northern members.\r\nAccording to present appearances this place cannot lodge a single person\r\nmore. As a great favor, I have got a bed in the corner of the public room\r\nof a tavern; and must continue till some of the Philadelphians make a\r\nvacancy by removing into the city. Then we must give him from four to six\r\nor eight dollars a week for cuddies without a bed, and sometimes without\r\na chair or table. There is not a single lodging house in the place. Ross\r\nand Willing are alive. Hancock is dead. Johnson of Maryland has _refused_\r\nRec. L. and McE. in contemplation; the last least. You will have seen\r\nGenet's letters to Moultree and to myself. Of the last I know nothing but\r\nfrom the public papers; and he published Moultree's letter and his answer\r\nthe moment he wrote it. You will see that his inveteracy against the\r\nPresident leads him to meditate the embroiling him with Congress. They say\r\nhe is going to be married to a daughter of Clinton's. If so, he is afraid\r\nto return to France. Hamilton is ill, and suspicious he has taken the\r\nfever again by returning to his house. He of course could not attend here\r\nto-day; but the President had showed me his letter on the right of calling\r\nCongress to another place. Adieu.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [3] [Probably to Mr. Madison.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                              GERMANTOWN, November 8, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have now to acknowledge and answer your letter of September the\r\n13th, wherein you desire that we may define the extent of the line of\r\nterritorial protection on the coasts of the United States, observing that\r\ngovernments and jurisconsults have different views on this subject.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that, therefore, they have been much divided in opinion,\r\nas to the distance from their sea coast to which they might reasonably\r\nclaim a right of prohibiting the commitment of hostilities. The greatest\r\ndistance to which any respectable assent among nations has been at any\r\ntime given, has been the extent of the human sight, estimated at upwards\r\nof twenty miles; and the smallest distance, I believe, claimed by any\r\nnation whatever, is the utmost range of a cannon ball, usually stated at\r\none sea league. Some intermediate distance have also been insisted on, and\r\nthat of three sea leagues has some authority in its favor. The character\r\nof our coast, remarkable in considerable parts of it for admitting no\r\nvessels of size to pass the shores, would entitle us in reason to as broad\r\na margin of protected navigation as any nation whatever. Not proposing,\r\nhowever, at this time, and without a respectful and friendly communication\r\nwith the powers interested in this navigation, to fix on the distance to\r\nwhich we may ultimately insist on the right of protection, the President\r\ngives instructions to the officers acting under his authority, to consider\r\nthose heretofore given them as restrained, for the present, to the\r\ndistance of one sea league, or three geographical miles, from the sea\r\nshore. This distance can admit of no opposition, as it is recognized by\r\ntreaties between some of the powers with whom we are connected in commerce\r\nand navigation, and is as little or less than is claimed by any of them on\r\ntheir own coasts.\r\n\r\nFuture occasions will be taken to enter into explanations with them, as to\r\nthe ulterior extent to which we may reasonably carry our jurisdiction. For\r\nthat of the rivers and bays of the United States, the laws of the several\r\nStates are understood to have made provision, and they are moreover, as\r\nbeing land-locked, within the body of the United States.\r\n\r\nExamining by this rule the case of the British brig Fanny, taken on the\r\n8th of May last, it appears from the evidence that the capture was made\r\nfour or five miles from the land; and consequently, without the line\r\nprovisionally adopted by the President, as before mentioned.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with sentiments of respect and esteem, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n                                            GERMANTOWN, November 10, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--As in cases where vessels are reclaimed by the subjects or citizens\r\nof the belligerent powers as having been taken within the jurisdiction\r\nof the United States, it becomes necessary to ascertain that fact by\r\ntestimony taken according to the laws of the United States. The Governors\r\nof the several States to whom the application will be made in the first\r\ninstance, are desired immediately to notify thereof the Attorney's of\r\ntheir respective districts. The Attorney is thereupon instructed to\r\ngive notice to the principal agent of both parties who may have come in\r\nwith the prize, and also to the consuls of the nations interested, and\r\nto recommend to them to appoint, by mutual consent, arbiters to decide\r\nwhether the capture was made within the jurisdiction of the United States,\r\nas stated to you in my letter of the 8th instant; according to whose\r\naward the Governor may proceed to deliver the vessel to the one or the\r\nother party. But in case the parties or consuls shall not agree to name\r\narbiters, then the Attorney, or some person substituted by him, is to\r\nnotify them of the time and place, when and where he will be, in order to\r\ntake the depositions of such witnesses as they may cause to come before\r\nhim, which depositions he is to transmit for the information and decision\r\nof the President.\r\n\r\nIt has been thought best to put this business into such a train as that\r\nthe examination of the fact may take place immediately, and before the\r\nwitnesses may have again departed from the United States, which would too\r\nfrequently happen, and especially in the distant States, if it should be\r\ndeferred until information is sent to the Executive, and a special order\r\nawaited to take the depositions.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of requesting that you will be pleased to give such\r\ninstructions to the consuls of your nation as may facilitate the object\r\nof this regulation. I urge it with the more earnestness because as\r\nthe attorneys of the districts are for the most part engaged in much\r\nbusiness of their own, they will rarely be able to attend more than one\r\nappointment, and consequently the party who should fail from negligence or\r\nother motive to produce his witnesses, at the time and place appointed,\r\nmight lose the benefit of their testimony altogether. This prompt\r\nprocedure is the more to be insisted on, as it will enable the President,\r\nby an immediate delivery of the vessel and cargo to the party having\r\ntitle, to prevent the injuries consequent on long delay.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY TO GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n                                           GERMANTOWN, November 14th, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 7th\r\ninstant, on the subject of the British ship Rochampton, taken and sent\r\ninto Baltimore by the French privateer the Industry, an armed schooner of\r\nSt. Domingo, which is suggested to have augmented her force at Baltimore\r\nbefore the capture. On this circumstance a demand is granted that the\r\nprize she has made shall be restored.\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to the matters of fact in this case, I will take the\r\nliberty of calling your attention to the rules which are to govern it.\r\nThese are, I. That restitution of prizes has been made by the Executive\r\nof the United States only in the two cases, 1st, of capture within their\r\njurisdiction, by armed vessels, originally constituted such without the\r\nlimits of the United States; or 2d, of capture, either within or without\r\ntheir jurisdiction, by armed vessels, originally constituted such within\r\nthe limits of the United States, which last have been called proscribed\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nII. That all _military equipments_ within the ports of the United States\r\nare forbidden to the vessels of the belligerent powers, even where they\r\nhave been constituted vessels of war before their arrival in our ports;\r\nand where such equipments have been made before detection, they are\r\nordered to be suppressed when detected, and the vessel reduced to her\r\noriginal condition. But if they escape detection altogether, depart and\r\nmake prizes, the Executive has not undertaken to restore the prizes.\r\n\r\nWith due care, it can scarcely happen that military equipments of any\r\nmagnitude shall escape discovery. Those which are small may sometimes,\r\nperhaps, escape, but to pursue these so far as to decide that the\r\nsmallest circumstance of military equipment to a vessel in our ports shall\r\ninvalidate her prizes through all time, would be a measure of incalculable\r\nconsequences. And since our interference must be governed by some general\r\nrule, and between great and small equipments no practicable line of\r\ndistinction can be drawn, it will be attended with less evil on the whole\r\nto rely on the efficacy of the means of prevention, that they will reach\r\nwith certainty equipments of any magnitude, and the great mass of those\r\nof smaller importance also; and if some should in the event, escape all\r\nour vigilance, to consider these as of the number of cases which will at\r\ntimes baffle the restraints of the wisest and best-guarded rules which\r\nhuman foresight can devise. And I think we may safely rely that since\r\nthe regulations which got into a course of execution about the middle of\r\nAugust last, it is scarcely possible that equipments of any importance\r\nshould escape discovery.\r\n\r\nThese principles showing that no demand of restitution holds on the\r\nground of a mere military alteration or an augmentation of force, I will\r\nconsider your letter only as a complaint that the orders of the President\r\nprohibiting these, have not had their effect in the case of the Industry,\r\nand enquire whether if this be so, it has happened either from neglect or\r\nconnivance in those charged with the execution of these orders. For this\r\nwe must resort to facts which shall be taken from the evidence furnished\r\nby yourself and the British vice-consul at Baltimore, and from that which\r\nshall accompany this letter.\r\n\r\nAbout the beginning of August the Industry is said to have arrived at\r\nBaltimore with the French fleet from St. Domingo; the particular state of\r\nher armament on her arrival is lately questioned, but it is not questioned\r\nthat she was an armed vessel of some degree. The Executive having received\r\nan intimation that two vessels were equipping themselves at Baltimore for\r\na cruise, a letter was on the 6th of August addressed by the Secretary\r\nof War to the Governor of Maryland, desiring an inquiry into the fact.\r\nIn his absence the Executive Council of Maryland charged one of their\r\nown body, the honorable Mr. Killy, with the inquiring. He proceeded to\r\nBaltimore, and after two days' examination found no vessel answering\r\nthe description of that which was the object of his inquiring. He then\r\nengaged the British vice-consul in the search, who was not able, any\r\nmore than himself, to discover any such vessels. Captain Killy, however,\r\nobserving a schooner, which appeared to have been making some equipments\r\nfor a cruise, to have added to her guns, and made some alteration in\r\nher waist, thought these circumstances merited examination, though the\r\nrules of August had not yet appeared. Finding that his inquiries excited\r\nsuspicion, and fearing the vessel might be withdrawn, he had her seized,\r\nand proceeded in investigation. He found that she was the schooner\r\nIndustry, Captain Carver, from St. Domingo: that she had been an armed\r\nvessel for three years before her coming here, and as late as April last\r\nhad mounted 16 guns; that she now mounted only 12, and he could not learn\r\nthat she had procured any of these, or done anything else, essential to\r\nher as a privateer, at Baltimore. He therefore discharged her, and on the\r\n23d of August the Executive Council made the report to the Secretary of\r\nWar, of which I enclose you a copy. About a fortnight after this (Sep.\r\n6) you added to a letter on other business a short paragraph, saying that\r\nyou had lately received information that a vessel named the Industry had,\r\nwithin the last five or six weeks, been armed, manned and equipped in the\r\nport of Baltimore. The proceedings before mentioned having been in another\r\ndepartment, were not then known to me. I therefore could only communicate\r\nthis paragraph to the proper department. The separation of the Executive\r\nwithin a few weeks after, prevented any explanations on this subject,\r\nand without them it was not in my power to either controvert or admit the\r\ninformation you had received under these circumstances. I think you must\r\nbe sensible, Sir, that your conclusion from my silence, that I regard the\r\nfact as proved, was a very necessary one.\r\n\r\nNew inquiries at that time could not have prevented the departure of the\r\nprivateer, or the capture of the Rochampton; for the privateer had then\r\nbeen out some time. The Rochampton was already taken, and was arriving at\r\nBaltimore, which she did about the day of the date of your letter. After\r\nher arrival, new witnesses had come forward to prove that the Industry\r\nhad made some military equipments at Baltimore before her cruise. The\r\naffidavits taken by the British vice-consul, are dated about nine or ten\r\ndays after the date of your letter and arrival of the Rochampton, and we\r\nhave only to lament that those witnesses had not given their information\r\nto the vice-consul when Mr. Killy engaged his aid in the enquiries he\r\nwas making, and when it would have had the effect of our detaining the\r\nprivateer till she should have reduced herself to the condition in which\r\nshe was when she arrived in our ports, if she had really added anything\r\nto her then force. But supposing the testimony just and full, (though\r\ntaken _ex parte_, and not under the legal sanction of our oath,) yet the\r\nGovernor's refusal to restore the prize was perfectly proper, for, as has\r\nbeen before observed, restitution has never been made by the Executive,\r\nnor can be made on a mere clandestine alteration or augmentation of\r\nmilitary equipments, which was all that the new testimony tended to prove.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, however, that the President thought the information\r\nobtained on the former occasion had cleared this privateer from any\r\nwell-grounded cause of arrest, yet that which you have now offered\r\nopens the possibility that the former was defective. He has therefore\r\ndesired new inquiry to be made before a magistrate legally authorized\r\nto administer an oath, and indifferent to both parties; and should the\r\nresult be that the vessel did really make any military equipments in our\r\nports, instructions will be given to reduce her to her original condition,\r\nwhenever she shall again come into our ports.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, Sir, I hope you will perceive that on the first intimation\r\nthrough their own channel, and without waiting for information on\r\nyour part, that a vessel was making military equipments at Baltimore,\r\nthe Executive took the best measures for inquiring into the fact, in\r\norder to prevent or suppress such equipments; that an officer of high\r\nrespectability was charged with the inquiry, and that he made it with\r\ngreat diligence himself, and engaged similar inquiries on the part of\r\nyour vice-consul; that neither of them could find that the privateer\r\nhad made such equipments, or, of course, that there was any ground for\r\nreducing or detaining her; that at the date of your letter of Sep. 6,\r\n(the first information received from you,) the privateer was departed,\r\nhad taken her prize, and that prize was arriving in port; that the new\r\nevidence taken ten days after that arrival can produce no other effect\r\nthan the institution of a new inquiry, and a reduction of the force of\r\nthe privateer, should she appear to have made any military alterations or\r\naugmentation, on her return into our ports, and that in no part of this\r\nproceeding is there the smallest ground for imputing either negligence or\r\nconnivance to any of the officers who have acted in it.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CIRACCHI, AT MUNICH.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, November 14, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received the favor of your letter of May 29, at Munich,\r\nand it was not till then that I knew to what place or through what channel\r\nto direct a letter to you. The assurances you receive that the monument\r\nof the President would be ordered at the new election, were founded\r\nin the expectation that he meant then to retire. The turbid affairs of\r\nEurope, however, and the intercessions they produced, prevailed on him\r\nto act again, though with infinite reluctance. You are sensible that the\r\nmoment of his retirement, kindling the enthusiasm for his character, the\r\naffections for his person, the recollection of his services, would be\r\nthat in which such a tribute would naturally be resolved on. This, of\r\ncourse, is now put off to the end of the next bissextile; but whenever it\r\narrives, your title to the execution is engraved in the minds of those who\r\nsaw your works here. Your purpose, with respect to my bust, is certainly\r\nflattering to me. My family has entered so earnestly into it, that I must\r\ngratify them with the hope, and myself with the permission, to make a just\r\nindemnification to the author. I shall be happy at all times to hear from\r\nyou, and to learn that your successes in life are as great as they ought\r\nto be. Accept assurances of my sincere respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                             GERMANTOWN, November 17, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have got good lodgings for Monroe and yourself, that is\r\nto say, a good room with a fireplace and two beds, in a pleasant and\r\nconvenient position, with a quiet family. They will breakfast you, but\r\nyou must mess in a tavern; there is a good one across the street. This is\r\nthe way in which all must do, and all I think will not be able to get even\r\nhalf beds. The President will remain here, I believe, till the meeting of\r\nCongress, merely to form a point of union for them before they can have\r\nacquired information and courage. For at present there does not exist\r\na single subject in the disorder, no new infection having taken place\r\nsince the great rains of the 1st of the month, and those before infected\r\nbeing dead or recovered. There is no doubt you will sit in Philadelphia,\r\nand therefore I have not given Monroe's letter to Sehal. I do not write\r\nto him, because I know not whether he is at present moving by sea or by\r\nland, and if by the latter, I presume you can communicate to him. Wayne\r\nhas had a convoy of twenty-two wagons of provisions, and seventy men cut\r\noff fifteen miles in his rear by the Indians. Six of the men were found\r\non the spot scalped, the rest supposed taken. He had nearly reached Fort\r\nHamilton. R. has given notice that he means to resign. Genet, by more and\r\nmore denials of powers to the President and ascribing them to Congress,\r\nis evidently endeavoring to sow tares between them, and at any event to\r\ncurry favor with the latter, to whom he means to turn his appeal, finding\r\nit was not likely to be well received by the people. Accept both of you my\r\nsincere affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SODERSTROM, CONSUL OF SWEDEN.\r\n\r\n                                             GERMANTOWN, November 20, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received last night your favor of the 16th. No particular rules\r\nhave been established by the President for the conduct of Consuls with\r\nrespect to prizes. In one particular case where a prize is brought\r\ninto our ports by any of the _belligerent_ parties, and is reclaimed\r\nof the Executive, the President has hitherto permitted the Consul of\r\nthe captor to hold the prize until his determinations is known. But in\r\nall cases respecting a neutral nation, their vessels are placed exactly\r\non the same footing with our own, entitled to the same remedy from our\r\ncourts of justice and the same protection from the Executive, as our own\r\nvessels in the same situation. The remedy in the courts of justice, the\r\nonly one which they or our own can have access to, is slower than where\r\nit lies with the Executive, but it is more complete, as damages can be\r\ngiven by the Court but not by the Executive. The President will gladly\r\navail himself of any information you can at any time give him where\r\nhis interference may be useful to the vessels or subjects of his Danish\r\nMajesty, the desire of the United States being to extend to the vessels\r\nand subjects of that crown, as well as to those of his Swedish Majesty,\r\nthe same protections as is given to those of our own citizens.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with much respect, Sir, your most obedient\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                             GERMANTOWN, November 22, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In my letter of October the 2d, I took the liberty of noticing\r\nto you, that the commission of consul to M. Dannery, ought to have been\r\naddressed to the President of the United States. He being the only channel\r\nof communication between this country and foreign nations, it is from him\r\nalone that foreign nations or their agents are to learn what is or has\r\nbeen the will of the nation, and whatever he communicates as such, they\r\nhave a right and are bound to consider as the expression of the nation,\r\nand no foreign agent can be allowed to question it, to interpose between\r\nhim and any other branch of government, under the pretext of either's\r\ntransgressing their functions, nor to make himself the umpire and final\r\njudge between them. I am, therefore, Sir, not authorized to enter into\r\nany discussions with you on the meaning of our Constitution in any part\r\nof it, or to prove to you that it has ascribed to him alone the admission\r\nor interdiction of foreign agents. I inform you of the fact by authority\r\nfrom the President. I had observed to you, that we were persuaded in\r\nthe case of the consul Dannery, the error in the address had proceeded\r\nfrom no intention in the Executive Council of France to question the\r\nfunctions of the President, and therefore no difficulty was made in\r\nissuing the commissions. We are still under the same persuasion. But in\r\nyour letter of the 14th instant, you _personally_ question the authority\r\nof the President, and in consequence of that, have not addressed to him\r\nthe commission of Messrs. Pennevert and Chervi. Making a point of this\r\nformality on your part, it becomes necessary to make a point of it on\r\nours also; and I am therefore charged to return you those commissions,\r\nand to inform you, that bound to enforce respect to the order of things\r\nestablished by our Constitution, the President will issue no Exequatur to\r\nany consul or vice-consul, not directed to him in the usual form, after\r\nthe party from whom it comes has been apprized that such should be the\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                             GERMANTOWN, November 27, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last letters to you were of the 11th and 14th of September,\r\nsince which I have received yours of July 5, 8, August 1, 15, 27, 28.\r\nThe fever, which at that time had given alarm in Philadelphia, became\r\nafterwards far more destructive than had been apprehended, and continued\r\nmuch longer, from the uncommon drought and warmth of the autumn. On\r\nthe first day of this month the President and heads of the department\r\nassembled here. On that day, also, began the first rains which had fallen\r\nfor some months. They were copious, and from that moment the infection\r\nceased, no new subject took it, and those before infected either died or\r\ngot well, so that the disease terminated most suddenly. The inhabitants\r\nwho had left the city, are now all returned, and business going on again\r\nas briskly as ever. The President will be established there in about a\r\nweek, at which time Congress is to meet.\r\n\r\nOur negotiations with the North-Western Indians have completely failed,\r\nso that war must settle our difference. We expected nothing else, and had\r\ngone into negotiations only to prove to all our citizens that peace was\r\nunattainable on terms which any one of them would admit.\r\n\r\nYou have probably heard of a great misunderstanding between Mr. Genet and\r\nus. On the meeting of Congress it will be made public. But as the details\r\nof it are lengthy, I must refer for them to my next letter, when possibly\r\nI may be able to send you the whole correspondence in print. We have kept\r\nit merely personal, convinced his nation will disapprove him. To them we\r\nhave with the utmost assiduity given every proof of inviolate attachment.\r\nWe wish to hear from you on the subject of Marquis de La Fayette, though\r\nwe know that circumstances do not admit sanguine hopes.\r\n\r\nThe copper by the Sigon and the Mohawk is received. Our coinage of silver\r\nhas been delayed by Mr. Cox's inability to give the security required by\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nI shall write to you again immediately after the meeting of Congress. I\r\nhave the honor to be, with sentiments of great esteem and respect, dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, November 30, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have laid before the President of the United States your letter\r\nof November 25th, and have now the honor to inform you, that most of its\r\nobjects being beyond the powers of the Executive, they can only manifest\r\ntheir dispositions by acting on those which are within their powers.\r\nInstructions are accordingly sent to the district attorneys of the United\r\nStates, residing within States wherein French consuls are established,\r\nrequiring them to inform the consuls of the nature of the provisions\r\nmade by the laws for preventing, as well as punishing, injuries to their\r\npersons, and to advise and assist them in calling these provisions into\r\nactivity, whenever the occasions for them shall arise.\r\n\r\nIt is not permitted by the law to prohibit the departure of the emigrants\r\nto St. Domingo, according to the wish you now express, any more than it\r\nwas to force them away, according to that expressed by you in a former\r\nletter. Our country is open to all men, to come and go peaceably, when\r\nthey choose; and your letter does not mention that these emigrants meant\r\nto depart armed, and equipped for war. Lest, however, this should be\r\nattempted, the Governors of the States of Pennsylvania and Maryland are\r\nrequested to have particular attention paid to the vessels named in your\r\nletter, and to see that no military expedition be covered or permitted\r\nunder color of the right which the passengers have to depart from these\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nProvisions not being classed among the articles of contraband, in time\r\nof war, it is possible that American vessels may have carried them to\r\nthe ports of Jeremie and La Mole, as they do to other dominions of the\r\nbelligerent Powers; but, if they have carried arms also, these, as being\r\ncontraband, might certainly have been stopped and confiscated.\r\n\r\nIn the letter of May 15th, to Mr. Ternant, I mentioned, that, in answer\r\nto the complaints of the British minister, against the exportation of arms\r\nfrom the United States, it had been observed that the manufacture of arms\r\nwas the occupation and livelihood of some of our citizens; that it ought\r\nnot to be expected that a war among other nations should produce such\r\nan internal derangement of the occupations of a nation at peace, as the\r\nsuppression of a manufacture which is the support of some of its citizens;\r\nbut that, if they should export these arms to nations at war, they would\r\nbe abandoned to the seizure and confiscation which the law of nations\r\nauthorized to be made of them on the high seas. This letter was handed to\r\nyou, and you were pleased, in yours of May 27th, expressly to approve of\r\nthe answer which had been given. On this occasion, therefore, we have only\r\nto declare, that the same conduct will be observed which was announced on\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nThe proposition to permit all our vessels destined for any port in the\r\nFrench West India islands to be stopped, unless furnished with passports\r\nfrom yourself, is so far beyond the powers of the Executive, that it will\r\nbe unnecessary to enumerate the objections to which it would be liable. I\r\nhave the honor to be, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                          December 2, 1793.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson, with his respects to the President, has the honor to\r\nsend him the letters and orders referred to in Mr. Morris' letter, except\r\nthat of the 8th of April, which must be a mistake for some other date, as\r\nthe records of the office perfectly establish that no letters were written\r\nto him in the months of March and April but those of March 12 and 15, and\r\nApril 20 and 26, now enclosed. The enigma of Mr. Merlino is inexplicable\r\nby anything in his possession.\r\n\r\nHe encloses the message respecting France and Great Britain. He first\r\nwrote it fair as it was agreed the other evening at the President's. He\r\nthen drew a line with a pen through the passages he proposes to alter,\r\nin consequence of subsequent information, (but so lightly as to leave the\r\npassages still legible for the President,) and interlined the alterations\r\nhe proposes. The overtures mentioned in the first alteration, are in\r\nconsequence of its having been agreed that they should be mentioned in\r\ngeneral terms only to the two houses. The numerous alterations made the\r\nother evening in the clause respecting our corn trade, with the hasty\r\namendments proposed in the moment, had so much broken the tissue of the\r\nparagraph, as to render it necessary to new mould it. In doing this, care\r\nhas been taken to use the same words as nearly as possible, and also to\r\ninsert a slight reference to Mr. Pinckney's proceedings.\r\n\r\nOn a severe review of the question, whether the British communication\r\nshould carry any such mark of being confidential, as to prevent the\r\nLegislature from publishing them, he is clearly of opinion they ought not.\r\nWill they be kept secret if secrecy is enjoined? certainly not, and all\r\nthe offence will be given (if it be possible any should be given) which\r\nwould follow their complete publication. If they would be kept secret,\r\nfrom whom would it be? from our own constituents only, for Great Britain\r\nis possessed of every tittle. Why, then, keep it secret from them? no\r\nground of support for the Executive will ever be so sure as a complete\r\nknowledge of their proceedings by the people; and it is only in cases\r\nwhere the public good would be injured, and _because_ it would be injured,\r\nthat proceedings should be secret. In such cases it is the duty of the\r\nExecutive to sacrifice their personal interests (which would be promoted\r\nby publicity) to the public interest. If the negotiations with England\r\nare at an end, if not given to the public now, when are they to be given?\r\nand what moment can be so interesting? If anything amiss should happen\r\nfrom the concealment, where will the blame _originate_ at last? It may be\r\nsaid, indeed, that the President _puts it in the power_ of the Legislature\r\nto communicate these proceedings to _their constituents_; but is it more\r\ntheir duty to communicate them to their constituents, than it is the\r\nPresident's to communicate them to _his constituents_? and if they were\r\ndesirous of communicating them, ought the President to restrain them by\r\nmaking the communication confidential? I think no harm can be done by the\r\npublication, because it is impossible England, after doing us an injury,\r\nshould _declare war_ against us, merely because we tell our constituents\r\nof it; and I think good may be done, because while it puts it in the\r\npower of the Legislature to adopt peaceable measures of doing ourselves\r\njustice, it prepares the minds of our constituents to go cheerfully into\r\nan acquiescence under the measures, by impressing them with a thorough and\r\nenlightened conviction that they are founded in right. The motive, too, of\r\nproving to the people the impartiality of the Executive between the two\r\nnations of France and England, urges strongly that while they are to see\r\nthe disagreeable things which have been going on as to France, we should\r\nnot conceal from them what has been passing with England, and induce a\r\nbelief that nothing has been doing.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, December 9, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 3d instant,\r\nwhich has been duly laid before the President.\r\n\r\nWe are very far from admitting your principle, that the government\r\non either side has no other right, on the presentation of a consular\r\ncommission, than to certify that, having examined it, they find it\r\naccording to rule. The governments of both nations have a right, and that\r\nof yours has exercised it as to us, of considering the character of the\r\nperson appointed; the place for which he is appointed, and other material\r\ncircumstances; and of taking precautions as to his conduct, if necessary;\r\nand this does not defeat the general object of the convention, which, in\r\nstipulating that consuls shall be permitted on both sides, could not mean\r\nto supersede reasonable objections to particular persons, who might at\r\nthe moment be obnoxious to the nation to which they were sent, or whose\r\nconduct might render them so at any time after. In fact, every foreign\r\nagent depends on the double will of the two governments, of that which\r\nsends him, and of that which is to permit the exercise of his functions\r\nwithin their territory; and when either of these wills is refused or\r\nwithdrawn, his authority to act within that territory becomes incomplete.\r\nBy what member of the government the right of giving or withdrawing\r\npermission is to be exercised here, is a question on which no foreign\r\nagent can be permitted to make himself the umpire. It is sufficient for\r\nhim, under our government, that he is informed of it by the executive.\r\n\r\nOn an examination of the commissions from your nation, among our records,\r\nI find that before the late change in the form of our government, foreign\r\nagents were addressed sometimes to the United States, and sometimes to the\r\nCongress of the United States, that body being then executive as well as\r\nlegislative. Thus the commissions of Messrs. L'Etombe, Holker, Daunemanis,\r\nMarbois, Creve-coeur, and Chateaufort, have all this clause: \"Prions\r\net requerons nos tres chers et grands amis et allies, les Etat Unis de\r\nl'Amerique septentrionale, leurs gouverneurs, et autres officiers, &c. de\r\nlaisser jouir, &c. le dit sieur, &c. de la charge de notre consul,\" &c. On\r\nthe change in the form of our government, foreign nations, not undertaking\r\nto decide to what member of the new government their agents should be\r\naddressed, ceased to do it to Congress, and adopted the general address\r\nto the United States, before cited. This was done by the government of\r\nyour own nation, as appears by the commissions of Messrs. Mangourit and La\r\nForest, which have in them the clause before cited. So your own commission\r\nwas, not as M. Gerond's and Luzerne's had been, \"a nos tres chers, &c.\r\nle President et membres du Congres general des Etats Unis,\" &c., but \"a\r\nnos tres chers, &c. les Etats Unis de l'Amerique,\" &c. Under this general\r\naddress, the proper member of the government was included, and could take\r\nit up. When, therefore, it was seen in the commission of Messrs. Dupont\r\nand Hauterieve, that your executive had returned to the ancient address\r\nto Congress, it was conceived to be an inattention, insomuch that I do\r\nnot recollect (and I do not think it material enough to inquire) whether\r\nI noticed it to you either verbally or by letter. When that of M. Dannery\r\nwas presented with the like address, being obliged to notice to you an\r\ninaccuracy of another kind, I then mentioned that of the address, not\r\ncalling it an _innovation_, but expressing my satisfaction, which is still\r\nentire, that it was not from any design in your Executive Council. The\r\nExequatur was therefore sent. That they will not consider our notice of\r\nit as an innovation, we are perfectly secure. No government can disregard\r\nformalities more than ours. But when formalities are attacked with a view\r\nto change principles, and to introduce an entire independence of foreign\r\nagents on the nation with whom they reside, it becomes material to defend\r\nformalities. They would be no longer trifles, if they could, in defiance\r\nof the national will, continue a foreign agent among us whatever might\r\nbe his course of action. Continuing, therefore, the refusal to receive\r\nany commission from _yourself_, addressed to an improper member of the\r\ngovernment, you are left free to use either the general one to the United\r\nStates, as in the commissions of Messrs. Mangourit and La Forest, before\r\ncited, or the special one, to the President of the United States.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with respect, Sir, your most obedient, and most\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                                         December 11, 1793.\r\n\r\nThe President doubtless recollects the communications of Mr. Ternant\r\nexpressing the dissatisfaction of the Executive Council of France with\r\nMr. Morris, our Minister there, which, however, Mr. Ternant desired\r\nmight be considered as informal; that Col. Smith also mentioned that\r\ndissatisfaction, and that Mr. Le Brun told him he would charge Mr. Genet\r\nexpressly with their representations on this subject; and that all further\r\nconsideration thereon lay over therefore for Mr. Genet's representations.\r\n\r\nMr. Genet, some time after his arrival (I cannot now recollect how long,\r\nbut I think it was a month or more), coming to my house in the country\r\none evening, joined me in a walk near the river. Our conversation was\r\non various topics, and not at all of an official complexion. As we were\r\nreturning to the house, being then I suppose on some subject relative\r\nto his country (though really I do not recall to mind what it was), he\r\nturned about to me, just in the passage of the gate, and said, \"but I\r\nmust tell you, we all depend on you to send us a good minister there,\r\nwith whom we may do business confidentially, in the place of Mr. Morris.\"\r\nThese are perhaps not the identical words, yet I believe they are nearly\r\nso; I am sure they are the substance, and he scarcely employed more in\r\nthe expression. It was unexpected, and, to avoid the necessity of an\r\nextempore answer, I instantly said something resuming the preceding thread\r\nof conversation, which went on, and no more was said about Mr. Morris.\r\nFrom this, I took it for granted, he meant now to come forth formally\r\nwith complaints against Mr. Morris, as we had been given to expect, and\r\ntherefore I mentioned nothing of this little expression to the President.\r\nTime slipped along; I expecting his complaints, and he not making them.\r\nIt was undoubtedly his office to bring forward his own business himself,\r\nand not at all mine, to hasten or call for it; and if it was not my duty,\r\nI could not be without reasons for not taking it on myself officiously.\r\nHe at length went to New York, to wit, about the * * * * * of * * * * *\r\nwithout having done anything formally on this subject. I now became\r\nuneasy lest he should consider the little sentence he had uttered to me as\r\neffectually, though not regularly, a complaint; but the more I reflected\r\non the subject, the more impossible it seemed that he could have viewed\r\nit as such; and the rather, because, if he had, he would naturally have\r\nasked from time to time, \"Well, what are you doing with my complaint with\r\nMr. Morris?\" or some question equivalent. But he never did. It is possible\r\nI may, at other times, have heard him speak unfavorably of Mr. Morris,\r\nthough I do not recollect any particular occasion; but I am sure he never\r\nmade to me any proposition to have him recalled. I believe I mentioned\r\nthis matter to Mr. Randolph before I left Philadelphia: I know I did after\r\nmy return; but I did not to the President till the receipt of Mr. Genet's\r\nletter of September 30, which, from some unaccountable delay of the post,\r\nnever came to me in Virginia, though I remained there till October 25\r\n(and received there three subsequent mails), and it never reached me in\r\nPhiladelphia, till December 2.\r\n\r\nThe preceding is the state of this matter, as nearly as I can recollect it\r\nat this time, and I am sure it is not materially inaccurate in any point.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. CHURCH.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, December 11, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The President has received your letter of August 16, with its\r\nenclosures. It was with deep concern that he learnt the unhappy fortunes\r\nof M. de La Fayette, and that he still learns his continuance under them.\r\nHis friendship for him could not fail to impress him with the desire of\r\nrelieving him, and he was sure that in endeavoring to do this, he should\r\ngratify the sincere attachments of his fellow citizens. He has accordingly\r\nemployed such means as appeared the most likely to effect his purpose;\r\nthough, under the existing circumstances, he could not be sanguine in\r\ntheir obtaining very immediately the desired effect. Conscious, however,\r\nthat his anxieties for the sufferer flow from no motives unfriendly\r\nto those who feel an interest in his confinement, he indulges their\r\ncontinuance, and will not relinquish the hope that the reasons for this\r\nsecurity will at length yield to those of a more benign character.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HAMMOND, MINISTER PLENIPOTENTIARY OF GREAT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, December 15, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I am to acknowledge the honor of your letter of November 30th, and\r\nto express the satisfaction with which we learn, that you are instructed\r\nto discuss with us the measures, which reason and practicability may\r\ndictate, for giving effect to the stipulations of our treaty, yet\r\nremaining to be executed. I can assure you, on the part of the United\r\nStates, of every disposition to lessen difficulties, by passing over\r\nwhatever is of smaller concern, and insisting on those matters only, which\r\neither justice to individuals or public policy render indispensable; and\r\nin order to simplify our discussions, by defining precisely their objects,\r\nI have the honor to propose that we shall begin by specifying, on each\r\nside, the particular acts which each considers to have been done by the\r\nother, in contravention of the treaty. I shall set the example.\r\n\r\nThe provisional and definitive treaties, in their 7th article, stipulated\r\nthat his \"Britannic Majesty should, with all convenient speed, and\r\nwithout causing any destruction, or _carrying away any negroes, or\r\nother property_, of the American inhabitants, _withdraw all his armies,\r\ngarrisons, and fleets, from the said United States_, and from every port,\r\nplace, and harbor, within the same.\"\r\n\r\nBut the British garrisons were not withdrawn with all convenient speed,\r\nnor have ever yet been withdrawn from Machilimackinac, on Lake Michigan;\r\nDetroit, on the strait of Lakes Erie and Huron; Fort Erie, on Lake Erie;\r\nNiagara, Oswego, on Lake Ontario; Oswegatchie, on the river St. Lawrence;\r\nPoint Au-fer, and Dutchman's Point, on Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\n2d. The British officers have undertaken to exercise a jurisdiction over\r\nthe country and inhabitants in the vicinities of those forts; and\r\n\r\n3d. They have excluded the citizens of the United States from navigating,\r\neven on our side of the middle line of the rivers and lakes established as\r\na boundary between the two nations.\r\n\r\nBy these proceedings, we have been intercepted entirely from the commerce\r\nof furs with the Indian nations, to the northward--a commerce which had\r\never been of great importance to the United States, not only for its\r\nintrinsic value, but as it was the means of cherishing peace with those\r\nIndians, and of superseding the necessity of that expensive warfare we\r\nhave been obliged to carry on with them, during the time that these posts\r\nhave been in other hands.\r\n\r\nOn withdrawing the troops from New York, 1st. A large embarkation\r\nof negroes, of the property of the inhabitants of the United States,\r\ntook place before the commissioners on our part, for inspecting and\r\nsuperintending embarkations, had arrived there, and without any account\r\never rendered thereof. 2d. Near three thousand others were publicly\r\ncarried away by the avowed order of the British commanding officer, and\r\nunder the view, and against the remonstrances of our commissioners. 3d.\r\nA very great number were carried off in private vessels, if not by the\r\nexpress permission, yet certainly without opposition on the part of the\r\ncommanding officer, who alone had the means of preventing it, and without\r\nadmitting the inspection of the American commissioners; and 4th. Of other\r\nspecies of property carried away, the commanding officer permitted no\r\nexamination at all. In support of these facts, I have the honor to enclose\r\nyou documents, a list of which will be subjoined, and in addition to\r\nthem, I beg leave to refer to a roll signed by the joint commissioners,\r\nand delivered to your commanding officer for transmission to his court,\r\ncontaining a description of the negroes publicly carried away by his\r\norder as before mentioned, with a copy of which you have doubtless been\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nA difference of opinion, too, having arisen as to the river intended by\r\nthe plenipotentiaries to be the boundary between us and the dominions of\r\nGreat Britain, and by them called the St Croix, which name, it seems, is\r\ngiven to two different rivers, the ascertaining of this point becomes\r\na matter of present urgency; it has heretofore been the subject of\r\napplication from us to the Government of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nThere are other smaller matters between the two nations, which remain to\r\nbe adjusted, but I think it would be better to refer these for settlement\r\nthrough the ordinary channel of our ministers, than to embarrass the\r\npresent important discussions with them; they can never be obstacles to\r\nfriendship and harmony.\r\n\r\nPermit me now, sir, to ask from you a specification of the particular\r\nacts, which, being considered by his Britannic Majesty as a non-compliance\r\non our part with the engagement contained in the 4th, 5th, and 6th\r\narticles of the treaty, induced him to suspend the execution of the\r\n7th, and render a separate discussion of them inadmissible. And accept\r\nassurances, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, December 18, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The Minister Plenipotentiary of France has enclosed to me a copy of\r\na letter of the 16th instant, which he addressed to you, stating that some\r\nlibellous publications had been made against him by Mr. Jay, Chief Justice\r\nof the United States, and Mr. King, one of the Senators for the State of\r\nNew York, and desiring that they might be prosecuted. This letter has been\r\nlaid before the President, according to the request of the minister; and\r\nthe President, never doubting your readiness on all occasions to perform\r\nthe functions of your office, yet thinks it incumbent on him to recommend\r\nit specially on the present occasion, as it concerns a public character\r\npeculiarly entitled to the protection of the laws. On the other hand, as\r\nour citizens ought not to be vexed with groundless prosecutions, duty\r\nto them requires it to be added, that if you judge the prosecution in\r\nquestion to be of that nature, you consider this recommendation as not\r\nextending to it; its only object being to engage you to proceed in this\r\ncase according to the duties of your office, the laws of the land, and the\r\nprivileges of the parties concerned.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect and esteem, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GOVERNOR OF SOUTH CAROLINA.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, December 23, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--It is my duty to communicate to you a piece of information, although\r\nI cannot say I have confidence in it myself. A French gentleman, one\r\nof the refugees from St. Domingo, informs me that two Frenchmen, from\r\nSt. Domingo also, of the names of Castaing and La Chaise, are about\r\nsetting out from this place for Charleston, with a design to excite an\r\ninsurrection among the negroes. He says that this is in execution of a\r\ngeneral plan, formed by the Brissotine party at Paris, the first branch\r\nof which has been carried into execution at St. Domingo. My informant\r\nis a person with whom I am well acquainted, of good sense, discretion\r\nand truth, and certainly believes this himself. I inquired of him the\r\nchannel of his information. He told me it was one which had given them\r\nmany pre-admonitions in St. Domingo, and which had never been found to be\r\nmistaken. He explained it to me; but I could by no means consider it as\r\na channel meriting reliance; and when I questioned him what could be the\r\nimpulse of these men, what their authority, what their means of execution,\r\nand what they could expect in result; he answered with conjectures\r\nwhich were far from sufficient to strengthen the fact. However, were\r\nanything to happen, I should deem myself inexcusable not to have made the\r\ncommunication. Your judgment will decide whether injury might not be done\r\nby making the suggestion public, or whether it ought to have any other\r\neffect than to excite attention to these two persons, should they come\r\ninto South Carolina. Castaing is described as a small dark mulatto, and La\r\nChaise as a Quarteron, of a tall fine figure.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with great respect, your Excellency's most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. EDWARDS.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, December 30, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of July\r\n30th and August 16th, and thank you for the information they contained.\r\nWe have now assembled a new Congress, being a fuller and more equal\r\nrepresentation of the people, and likely, I think, to approach nearer\r\nto the sentiments of the people in the demonstration of their own. They\r\nhave the advantage of a very full communication from the Executive of\r\nthe ground on which we stand with foreign nations. Some very unpleasant\r\ntransactions have taken place here with Mr. Genet, of which the world will\r\njudge, as the correspondence is now in the press; as is also that with Mr.\r\nHammond on our points of difference with his nation. Of these you will\r\ndoubtless receive copies. Had they been out yet, I should have had the\r\npleasure of sending them to you; but to-morrow I resign my office, and\r\ntwo days after set out for Virginia, where I hope to spend the remainder\r\nof my days in occupations infinitely more pleasing than those to which\r\nI have sacrificed eighteen years of the prime of my life; I might rather\r\nsay twenty-four of them. Our campaign with the Indians has been lost by\r\nan unsuccessful effort to effect peace by treaty, which they protracted\r\ntill the season for action was over. The attack brought on us from the\r\nAlgerines is a ray from the same centre. I believe we shall endeavor to\r\ndo ourselves justice in a peaceable and rightful way. We wish to have\r\nnothing to do in the present war; but if it is to be forced upon us, I am\r\nhappy to see in the countenances of all but our paper men a mind ready\r\nmade up to meet it, unwillingly, indeed, but perfectly without fear. No\r\nnation has strove more than we have done to merit the peace of all by the\r\nmost rigorous impartiality to all. Sir John Sinclair's queries shall be\r\nanswered from my retirement. I am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GENET.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, December 31, 1793.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have laid before the President of the United States your letter\r\nof the 20th instant, accompanying translations of the instructions given\r\nyou by the Executive Council of France to be distributed among the members\r\nof Congress, desiring that the President will lay them officially before\r\nboth houses, and proposing to transmit successively other papers, to be\r\nlaid before them in like manner; and I have it in charge to observe, that\r\nyour functions as the missionary of a foreign nation here, are confined\r\nto the transactions of the affairs of your nation with the Executive of\r\nthe United States; that the communications, which are to pass between\r\nthe Executive and Legislative branches, cannot be a subject for your\r\ninterference, and that the President must be left to judge for himself\r\nwhat matters his duty or the public good may require him to propose to the\r\ndeliberations of Congress. I have therefore the honor of returning you the\r\ncopies sent for distribution, and of being, with great respect, Sir, your\r\nmost obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, December 31, 1793.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Having had the honor of communicating to you in my letter of\r\nthe last of July, my purpose of returning from the office of Secretary\r\nof State, at the end of the month of September, you were pleased, for\r\nparticular reasons, to wish its postponement to the close of the year.\r\nThat term being now arrived, and my propensities to retirement becoming\r\ndaily more and more irresistible, I now take the liberty of resigning the\r\noffice into your hands. Be pleased to accept with it my sincere thanks for\r\nall the indulgences which you have been so good as to exercise towards me\r\nin the discharge of its duties. Conscious that my need of them has been\r\ngreat, I have still ever found them greater, without any other claim on\r\nmy part, than a firm pursuit of what has appeared to me to be right, and\r\na thorough disdain of all means which were not as open and honorable, as\r\ntheir object was pure. I carry into my retirement a lively sense of your\r\ngoodness, and shall continue gratefully to remember it. With very sincere\r\nprayers for your life, health and tranquillity, I pray you to accept the\r\nhomage of the great and constant respect and attachment with which I have\r\nthe honor to be, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 3, 1794.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to thank you for the transmission of the letters\r\nfrom General Gates, La Motte, and Hauterieve. I perceive by the latter,\r\nthat the partisans of the one or the other principle (perhaps of both)\r\nhave thought my name a convenient cover for declarations of their own\r\nsentiments. What those are to which Hauterieve alludes, I know not,\r\nhaving never seen a newspaper since I left Philadelphia (except those\r\nof Richmond), and no circumstances authorize him to expect that I should\r\ninquire into them, or answer him. I think it is Montaigne who has said,\r\nthat ignorance is the softest pillow on which a man can rest his head.\r\nI am sure it is true as to everything political, and shall endeavor to\r\nestrange myself to everything of that character. I indulge myself on one\r\npolitical topic only, that is, in declaring to my countrymen the shameless\r\ncorruption of a portion of the Representatives to the first and second\r\nCongresses, and their implicit devotion to the treasury. I think I do\r\ngood in this, because it may produce exertions to reform the evil, on the\r\nsuccess of which the form of the government is to depend.\r\n\r\nI am sorry La Motte has put me to the expense of one hundred and forty\r\nlivres for a French translation of an English poem, as I make it a\r\nrule never to read translations where I can read the original. However,\r\nthe question now is, how to get the book brought here, as well as the\r\ncommunications with Mr. Hammond, which you were so kind as to promise me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is the first letter I have written to Philadelphia since my arrival\r\nat home, and yours the only ones I have received.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my sincere esteem and respect. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, April 3, 1794.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Our post having ceased to ride ever since the inoculation began\r\nin Richmond, till now, I received three days ago, and all together, your\r\nfriendly favors of March the 2d, 9th, 12th, 14th, and Colonel Monroe's of\r\nMarch the 3d and 16th. I have been particularly gratified by the receipt\r\nof the papers containing yours and Smith's discussion of your regulating\r\npropositions. These debates had not been seen here but in a very short\r\nand mutilated form. I am at no loss to ascribe Smith's speech to its true\r\nfather. Every tittle of it is Hamilton's except the introduction. There\r\nis scarcely anything there which I have not heard from him in our various\r\nprivate though official discussions. The very turn of the arguments is the\r\nsame, and others will see as well as myself that the style is Hamilton's.\r\nThe sophistry is too fine, too ingenious, even to have been comprehended\r\nby Smith, much less devised by him. His reply shows he did not understand\r\nhis first speech; as its general inferiority proves its legitimacy,\r\nas evidently as it does the bastardy of the original. You know we had\r\nunderstood that Hamilton had prepared a counter report, and that some of\r\nhis humble servants in the Senate were to move a reference to him in order\r\nto produce it. But I suppose they thought it would have a better effect\r\nif fired off in the House of Representatives. I find the report, however,\r\nso fully justified, that the anxieties with which I left it are perfectly\r\nquieted. In this quarter, all espouse your propositions with ardor, and\r\nwithout a dissenting voice.\r\n\r\nThe rumor of a declaration of war has given an opportunity of seeing, that\r\nthe people here, though attentive to the loss of value of their produce\r\nin such an event, yet find in it a gratification of some other passions,\r\nand particularly of their ancient hatred to Great Britain. Still, I hope\r\nit will not come to that; but that the proposition will be carried, and\r\njustice be done ourselves in a peaceable way. As to the guarantee of\r\nthe French islands, whatever doubts may be entertained of the moment at\r\nwhich we ought to interpose, yet I have no doubt but that we ought to\r\ninterpose at a proper time, and declare both to England and France that\r\nthese islands are to rest with France, and that we will make a common\r\ncause with the latter for that object. As to the naval armament, the land\r\narmament, and the marine fortifications which are in question with you, I\r\nhave no doubt they will all be carried. Not that the monocrats and paper\r\nmen in Congress want war; but they want armies and debts; and though we\r\nmay hope that the sound part of Congress is now so augmented as to insure\r\na majority in cases of general interest merely, yet I have always observed\r\nthat in questions of expense, where members may hope either for offices\r\nor jobs for themselves or their friends, some few will be debauched, and\r\nthat is sufficient to turn the decision where a majority is, at most, but\r\nsmall. I have never seen a Philadelphia paper since I left it, till those\r\nyou enclosed me; and I feel myself so thoroughly weaned from the interest\r\nI took in the proceedings there, while there, that I have never had a wish\r\nto see one, and believe that I never shall take another newspaper of any\r\nsort. I find my mind totally absorbed in my rural occupations.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccept sincere assurances of affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 25, 1794.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am to thank you for the book you were so good as to transmit\r\nme, as well as the letter covering it, and your felicitations on my\r\npresent quiet. The difference of my present and past situation is such as\r\nto leave me nothing to regret, but that my retirement has been postponed\r\nfour years too long. The principles on which I calculated the value of\r\nlife, are entirely in favor of my present course. I return to farming with\r\nan ardor which I scarcely knew in my youth, and which has got the better\r\nentirely of my love of study. Instead of writing ten or twelve letters\r\na day, which I have been in the habit of doing as a thing in course,\r\nI put off answering my letters now, farmer-like, till a rainy day, and\r\nthen find them sometimes postponed by other necessary occupations. The\r\ncase of the Pays de Vaud is new to me. The claims of both parties are\r\non grounds which, I fancy, we have taught the world to set little store\r\nby. The rights of one generation will scarcely be considered hereafter\r\nas depending on the paper transactions of another. My countrymen are\r\ngroaning under the insults of Great Britain. I hope some means will turn\r\nup of reconciling our faith and honor with peace. I confess to you I have\r\nseen enough of one war never to wish to see another. With wishes of every\r\ndegree of happiness to you, both public and private, and with my best\r\nrespects to Mrs. Adams, I am, your affectionate and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TENCH COXE.\r\n\r\n                                                   MONTICELLO, May 1, 1794.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your several favors of February the 22d, 27th, and March the\r\n16th, which had been accumulating in Richmond during the prevalence of\r\nthe small pox in that place, were lately brought to me, on the permission\r\ngiven the post to resume his communication. I am particularly to thank you\r\nfor your favor in forwarding the Bee. Your letters give a comfortable view\r\nof French affairs, and later events seem to confirm it. Over the foreign\r\npowers I am convinced they will triumph completely, and I cannot but hope\r\nthat that triumph, and the consequent disgrace of the invading tyrants, is\r\ndestined, in order of events, to kindle the wrath of the people of Europe\r\nagainst those who have dared to embroil them in such wickedness, and to\r\nbring at length, kings, nobles and priests to the scaffolds which they\r\nhave been so long deluging with human blood. I am still warm whenever I\r\nthink of these scoundrels, though I do it as seldom as I can, preferring\r\ninfinitely to contemplate the tranquil growth of my lucerne and potatoes.\r\nI have so completely withdrawn myself from these spectacles of usurpation\r\nand misrule, that I do not take a single newspaper, nor read one a month;\r\nand I feel myself infinitely the happier for it.\r\n\r\nWe are alarmed here with the apprehensions of war; and sincerely anxious\r\nthat it may be avoided; but not at the expense either of our faith or\r\nhonor. It seems much the general opinion here, the latter has been too\r\nmuch wounded not to require reparation, and to seek it even in war, if\r\nthat be necessary. As to myself, I love peace, and I am anxious that\r\nwe should give the world still another useful lesson, by showing to\r\nthem other modes of punishing injuries than by war, which is as much a\r\npunishment to the punisher as to the sufferer. I love, therefore, Mr.\r\nClarke's proposition of cutting off all communication with the nation\r\nwhich has conducted itself so atrociously. This, you will say, may bring\r\non war. If it does, we will meet it like men; but it may not bring on\r\nwar, and then the experiment will have been a happy one. I believe this\r\nwar would be vastly more unanimously approved than any one we ever were\r\nengaged in; because the aggressions have been so wanton and bare-faced,\r\nand so unquestionably against our desire. I am sorry Mr. Cooper and\r\nPriestly did not take a more general survey of our country before they\r\nfixed themselves. I think they might have promoted their own advantage\r\nby it, and have aided the introduction of improvement where it is more\r\nwanting. The prospect of wheat for the ensuing year is a bad one. This\r\nis all the sort of news you can expect from me. From you I shall be glad\r\nto hear all sort of news, and particularly any improvements in the arts\r\napplicable to husbandry or household manufacture.\r\n\r\nI am, with very sincere affection, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 14, 1794.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am honored with your favor of April the 24th, and received,\r\nat the same time, Mr. Bertrand's agricultural prospectus. Though he\r\nmentions my having seen him at a particular place, yet I remember nothing\r\nof it, and observing that he intimates an application for lands in\r\nAmerica, I conceive his letter meant for me as Secretary of State, and\r\ntherefore I now send it to the Secretary of State. He has given only the\r\nheads of his demonstrations, so that nothing can be conjectured of their\r\ndetails. Lord Kaims once proposed an essence of dung, one pint of which\r\nshould manure an acre. If he or Mr. Bertrand could have rendered it so\r\nportable, I should have been one of those who would have been greatly\r\nobliged to them. I find on a more minute examination of my lands than\r\nthe short visits heretofore made to them permitted, that a ten years'\r\nabandonment of them to the ravages of overseers, has brought on them a\r\ndegree of degradation far beyond what I had expected. As this obliges me\r\nto adopt a milder course of cropping, so I find that they have enabled\r\nme to do it, by having opened a great deal of lands during my absence. I\r\nhave therefore determined on a division of my farm into six fields, to\r\nbe put under this rotation: first year, wheat; second, corn, potatoes,\r\npeas; third, rye or wheat, according to circumstances; fourth and fifth,\r\nclover where the fields will bring it, and buckwheat dressings where they\r\nwill not; sixth, folding, and buckwheat dressings. But it will take me\r\nfrom three to six years to get this plan underway. I am not yet satisfied\r\nthat my acquisition of overseers from the head of Elk has been a happy\r\none, or that much will be done this year towards rescuing my plantations\r\nfrom their wretched condition. Time, patience and perseverance must be the\r\nremedy; and the maxim of your letter, \"slow and sure,\" is not less a good\r\none in agriculture than in politics. I sincerely wish it may extricate\r\nus from the event of a war, if this can be done saving our faith and our\r\nrights. My opinion of the British government is, that nothing will force\r\nthem to do justice but the loud voice of their people, and that this\r\ncan never be excited but by distressing their commerce. But I cherish\r\ntranquillity too much, to suffer political things to enter my mind at all.\r\nI do not forget that I owe you a letter for Mr. Young; but I am waiting\r\nto get full information. With every wish for your health and happiness,\r\nand my most friendly respects for Mrs. Washington, I have the honor to be,\r\ndear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, May 15, 1794.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 3d of April, and since that have received\r\nyours of March 24, 26, 31, April 14 and 28, and yesterday I received\r\nColonel Monroe's of the 4th instant, informing me of the failure of the\r\nNon-importation Bill in the Senate. This body was intended as a check on\r\nthe will of the Representatives when too hasty. They are not only that,\r\nbut completely so on the will of the people also; and in my opinion are\r\nheaping coals of fire, not only on their persons, but on their body, as a\r\nbranch of the Legislature. I have never known a measure more universally\r\ndesired by the people than the passage of that bill. It is not from my\r\nown observation of the wishes of the people that I would decide what they\r\nare, but from that of the gentlemen of the bar, who move much with them,\r\nand by their intercommunications with each other, have, under their view,\r\na greater portion of the country than any other description of men. It\r\nseems that the opinion is fairly launched into public that they should\r\nbe placed under the control of a more frequent recurrence to the will\r\nof their constituents. This seems requisite to complete the experiment,\r\nwhether they do more harm or good. I wrote lately to Mr. Taylor for the\r\npamphlet on the bank. Since that I have seen the \"Definition of Parties,\"\r\nand must pray you to bring it for me. It is one of those things which\r\nmerits to be preserved. The safe arrival of my books at Richmond, and some\r\nof them at home, has relieved me from anxiety, and will not be indifferent\r\nto you. It turns out that our fruit has not been as entirely killed as was\r\nat first apprehended; some latter blossoms have yielded a small supply of\r\nthis precious refreshment. I was so improvident as never to have examined\r\nat Philadelphia whether negro cotton and oznaburgs can be had there; if\r\nyou do not already possess the information, pray obtain it before you\r\ncome away. Our spring has, on the whole, been seasonable; and the wheat\r\nas much recovered as its thinness would permit; but the crop must still\r\nbe a miserable one. There would not have been seed made but for the\r\nextraordinary rains of the last month. Our highest heat as yet has been\r\n83, this was on the 4th instant. That Blake should not have been arrived\r\nat the date of your letter, surprises me; pray inquire into that fact\r\nbefore you leave Philadelphia. According to Colonel Monroe's letter this\r\nwill find you on the point of departure. I hope we shall see you here soon\r\nafter your return. Remember me affectionately to Colonel and Mrs. Monroe,\r\nand accept the sincere esteem of, dear Sir, your sincere friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 7, 1794.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of August the 28th finds me in bed, under a paroxysm\r\nof the rheumatism which has now kept me for ten days in constant torment,\r\nand presents no hope of abatement. But the express and the nature of the\r\ncase requiring immediate answer, I write to you in this situation. No\r\ncircumstances, my dear Sir, will ever more tempt me to engage in any thing\r\npublic. I thought myself perfectly fixed in this determination when I left\r\nPhiladelphia, but every day and hour since has added to its inflexibility.\r\nIt is a great pleasure to me to retain the esteem and approbation of\r\nthe President, and this forms the only ground of any reluctance at being\r\nunable to comply with every wish of his. Pray convey these sentiments,\r\nand a thousand more to him, which my situation does not permit me to go\r\ninto. But however suffering by the addition of every single word to this\r\nletter, I must add a solemn declaration that neither Mr. J. nor Mr. ----\r\never mentioned to me one word of any want of decorum in Mr. Carmichael,\r\nnor anything stronger or more special than stated in my notes of the\r\nconversation. Excuse my brevity, my dear Sir, and accept assurances of\r\nthe sincere esteem and respect with which I have the honor to be, your\r\naffectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON NICHOLAS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 22, 1794.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I take the liberty of enclosing for your perusal and consideration\r\na proposal from a Mr. D'Ivernois, a Genevan, of considerable distinction\r\nfor science and patriotism, and that, too, of the republican kind, though\r\nyou will see that he does not carry it so far as our friends of the\r\nNational Assembly of France. While I was at Paris, I knew him as an exile\r\nfrom his democratic principles, the aristocracy having then the upper\r\nhand in Geneva. He is now obnoxious to the democratic party. The sum of\r\nhis proposition is to translate the academy of Geneva in a body to this\r\ncountry. You know well that the colleges of Edinburgh and Geneva, as\r\nseminaries of science, are considered as the two eyes of Europe; while\r\nGreat Britain and America give the preference to the former, and all other\r\ncountries give it to the latter. I am fully sensible that two powerful\r\nobstacles are in the way of this proposition. 1st. The expense: 2d. The\r\ncommunication of science in foreign languages; that is to say, in French\r\nand Latin; but I have been so long absent from my own country as to be\r\nan incompetent judge either of the force of the objections or of the\r\ndispositions of those who are to decide on them. The respectability of\r\nMr. D'Ivernois' character, and that, too, of the proposition, require an\r\nanswer from me, and that it should be given on due inquiry. He desires\r\nsecrecy to a certain degree for the reasons which he explains. What I\r\nhave to request of you, my dear Sir, is, that you will be so good as to\r\nconsider his proposition, to consult on its expediency and practicability\r\nwith such gentlemen of the Assembly as you think best, and take such other\r\nmeasures as you shall think best to ascertain what would be the sense of\r\nthat body, were the proposition to be hazarded to them. If yourself and\r\nfriends approve of it, and there is hope that the Assembly would do so,\r\nyour zeal for the good of our country in general, and the promotion of\r\nscience, as an instrument towards that, will, of course, induce you to aid\r\nthem to bring it forward in such a way as you shall judge best. If, on the\r\ncontrary, you disapprove of it yourselves, or think it would be desperate\r\nwith the Assembly, be so good as to return it to me with such information\r\nas I may hand forward to Mr. D'Ivernois, to put him out of suspense. Keep\r\nthe matter by all means out of the public papers, and particularly, if\r\nyou please, do not couple my name with the proposition if brought forward,\r\nbecause it is much my wish to be in nowise implicated in public affairs.\r\nIt is necessary for me to appeal to all my titles for giving you this\r\ntrouble, whether founded in representation, patriotism or friendship. The\r\nlatter, however, as the broadest, is that on which I wish to rely, being\r\nwith sentiments of very cordial esteem, dear Sir, your sincere friend and\r\nhumble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 28, 1794.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have kept Mr. Jay's letter a post or two, with an intention\r\nof considering attentively the observation it contains; but I have\r\nreally now so little stomach for anything of that kind, that I have\r\nnot resolution enough even to endeavor to understand the observations.\r\nI therefore return the letter, not to delay your answer to it, and beg\r\nyou in answering for yourself, to assure him of my respects and thankful\r\nacceptance of Chalmers' Treaties, which I do not possess, and if you\r\npossess yourself of the scope of his reasoning, make any answer to it you\r\nplease for me. If it had been on the rotation of my crops, I would have\r\nanswered myself, lengthily perhaps, but certainly _con gusto_.\r\n\r\nThe denunciation of the democratic societies is one of the extraordinary\r\nacts of boldness of which we have seen so many from the faction of\r\nmonocrats. It is wonderful indeed, that the President should have\r\npermitted himself to be the organ of such an attack on the freedom of\r\ndiscussion, the freedom of writing, printing and publishing. It must\r\nbe a matter of rare curiosity to get at the modifications of these\r\nrights proposed by them, and to see what line their ingenuity would draw\r\nbetween democratical societies, whose avowed object is the nourishment\r\nof the republican principles of our Constitution, and the society of\r\nthe Cincinnati, _a self-created_ one, carving out for itself hereditary\r\ndistinctions, lowering over our Constitution eternally, meeting together\r\nin all parts of the Union, periodically, with closed doors, accumulating a\r\ncapital in their separate treasury, corresponding secretly and regularly,\r\nand of which society the very persons denouncing the democrats are\r\nthemselves the fathers, founders and high officers. Their sight must be\r\nperfectly dazzled by the glittering of crowns and coronets, not to see\r\nthe extravagance of the proposition to suppress the friends of general\r\nfreedom, while those who wish to confine that freedom to the few, are\r\npermitted to go on in their principles and practices. I here put out\r\nof sight the persons whose misbehavior has been taken advantage of to\r\nslander the friends of popular rights; and I am happy to observe, that as\r\nfar as the circle of my observation and information extends, everybody\r\nhas lost sight of them, and views the abstract attempt on their natural\r\nand constitutional rights in all its nakedness. I have never heard, or\r\nheard of, a single expression or opinion which did not condemn it as an\r\ninexcusable aggression. And with respect to the transactions against the\r\nexcise law, it appears to me that you are all swept away in the torrent\r\nof governmental opinions, or that we do not know what these transactions\r\nhave been. We know of none which, according to the definitions of the\r\nlaw, have been anything more than riotous. There was indeed a meeting to\r\nconsult about a separation. But to consult on a question does not amount\r\nto a determination of that question in the affirmative, still less to\r\nthe acting on such a determination; but we shall see, I suppose, what the\r\ncourt lawyers, and courtly judges, and would-be ambassadors will make of\r\nit. The excise law is an infernal one. The first error was to admit it by\r\nthe Constitution; the second, to act on that admission; the third and last\r\nwill be, to make it the instrument of dismembering the Union, and setting\r\nus all afloat to choose what part of it we will adhere to. The information\r\nof our militia, returned from the westward, is uniform, that though the\r\npeople there let them pass quietly, they were objects of their laughter,\r\nnot of their fear; that one thousand men could have cut off their whole\r\nforce in a thousand places of the Alleghany; that their detestation of\r\nthe excise law is universal, and has now associated to it a detestation of\r\nthe government; and that a separation which perhaps was a very distant and\r\nproblematical event, is now near, and certain, and determined in the mind\r\nof every man. I expected to have seen some justification of arming one\r\npart of the society against another; of declaring a civil war the moment\r\nbefore the meeting of that body which has the sole right of declaring war;\r\nof being so patient of the kicks and scoffs of our enemies, and rising\r\nat a feather against our friends; of adding a million to the public debt\r\nand deriding us with recommendations to pay it if we can &c., &c. But\r\nthe part of the speech which was to be taken as a justification of the\r\narmament, reminded me of parson Saunders' demonstration why _minus_ into\r\n_minus_ make _plus_. After a parcel of shreds of stuff from Æsop's fables\r\nand Tom Thumb, he jumps all at once into his _ergo_, _minus_ multiplied\r\ninto _minus_ make _plus_. Just so the fifteen thousand men enter after the\r\nfables, in the speech.\r\n\r\nHowever, the time is coming when we shall fetch up the lee-way of our\r\nvessel. The changes in your House, I see, are going on for the better,\r\nand even the Augean herd over your heads are slowly purging off their\r\nimpurities. Hold on then, my dear friend, that we may not shipwreck in\r\nthe meanwhile. I do not see, in the minds of those with whom I converse,\r\na greater affliction than the fear of your retirement; but this must\r\nnot be, unless to a more splendid and a more efficacious post. There I\r\nshould rejoice to see you; I hope I may say, I shall rejoice to see you.\r\nI have long had much in my mind to say to you on that subject. But double\r\ndelicacies have kept me silent. I ought perhaps to say, while I would\r\nnot give up my own retirement for the empire of the universe, how I can\r\njustify wishing one whose happiness I have so much at heart as yours, to\r\ntake the front of the battle which is fighting for my security. This would\r\nbe easy enough to be done, but not at the heel of a lengthy epistle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Madison, and pray her to keep you where\r\nyou are for her own satisfaction and the public good, and accept the\r\ncordial affections of us all. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. D'IVERNOIS.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 6, 1795.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your several favors on the affairs of Geneva found me here,\r\nin the month of December last. It is now more than a year that I have\r\nwithdrawn myself from public affairs, which I never liked in my life,\r\nbut was drawn into by emergencies which threatened our country with\r\nslavery, but ended in establishing it free. I have returned, with infinite\r\nappetite, to the enjoyment of my farm, my family and my books, and had\r\ndetermined to meddle in nothing beyond their limits. Your proposition,\r\nhowever, for transplanting the college of Geneva to my own county, was too\r\nanalogous to all my attachments to science, and freedom, the first-born\r\ndaughter of science, not to excite a lively interest in my mind, and the\r\nessays which were necessary to try its practicability. This depended\r\naltogether on the opinions and dispositions of our State legislature,\r\nwhich was then in session. I immediately communicated your papers to a\r\nmember of the legislature, whose abilities and zeal pointed him out as\r\nproper for it, urging him to sound as many of the leading members of the\r\nlegislature as he could, and if he found their opinions favorable, to\r\nbring forward the proposition; but if he should find it desperate, not\r\nto hazard it; because I thought it best not to commit the honor either\r\nof our State or of your college, by an useless act of eclat. It was not\r\ntill within these three days that I have had an interview with him, and an\r\naccount of his proceedings. He communicated the papers to a great number\r\nof the members, and discussed them maturely, but privately, with them.\r\nThey were generally well-disposed to the proposition, and some of them\r\nwarmly; however, there was no difference of opinion in the conclusion,\r\nthat it could not be effected. The reasons which they thought would with\r\ncertainty prevail against it, were 1, that our youth, not familiarized\r\nbut with their mother tongue, were not prepared to receive instructions in\r\nany other; 2, that the expense of the institution would excite uneasiness\r\nin their constituents, and endanger its permanence; and 3, that its\r\nextent was disproportioned to the narrow state of the population with us.\r\nWhatever might be urged on these several subjects, yet as the decision\r\nrested with others, there remained to us only to regret that circumstances\r\nwere such, or were thought to be such, as to disappoint your and our\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\nI should have seen with peculiar satisfaction the establishment of such a\r\nmass of science in my country, and should probably have been tempted to\r\napproach myself to it, by procuring a residence in its neighborhood, at\r\nthose seasons of the year at least when the operations of agriculture are\r\nless active and interesting. I sincerely lament the circumstances which\r\nhave suggested this emigration. I had hoped that Geneva was familiarized\r\nto such a degree of liberty, that they might without difficulty or\r\ndanger fill up the measure to its _maximum_; a term, which, though in\r\nthe insulated man, bounded only by his natural powers, must, in society,\r\nbe so far restricted as to protect himself against the evil passions of\r\nhis associates, and consequently, them against him. I suspect that the\r\ndoctrine, that small States alone are fitted to be republics, will be\r\nexploded by experience, with some other brilliant fallacies accredited by\r\nMontesquieu and other political writers. Perhaps it will be found, that\r\nto obtain a just republic (and it is to secure our just rights that we\r\nresort to government at all) it must be so extensive as that local egoisms\r\nmay never reach its greater part; that on every particular question, a\r\nmajority may be found in its councils free from particular interests, and\r\ngiving, therefore, an uniform prevalence to the principles of justice. The\r\nsmaller the societies, the more violent and more convulsive their schisms.\r\nWe have chanced to live in an age which will probably be distinguished\r\nin history, for its experiments in government on a larger scale than has\r\nyet taken place. But we shall not live to see the result. The grosser\r\nabsurdities, such as hereditary magistracies, we shall see exploded in our\r\nday, long experience having already pronounced condemnation against them.\r\nBut what is to be the substitute? This our children or grand children\r\nwill answer. We may be satisfied with the certain knowledge that none can\r\never be tried, so stupid, so unrighteous, so oppressive, so destructive of\r\nevery end for which honest men enter into government, as that which their\r\nforefathers had established, and their fathers alone venture to tumble\r\nheadlong from the stations they have so long abused. It is unfortunate,\r\nthat the efforts of mankind to recover the freedom of which they have been\r\nso long deprived, will be accompanied with violence, with errors, and even\r\nwith crimes. But while we weep over the means, we must pray for the end.\r\n\r\nBut I have been insensibly led by the general complexion of the times,\r\nfrom the particular case of Geneva, to those to which it bears no\r\nsimilitude. Of that we hope good things. Its inhabitants must be too\r\nmuch enlightened, too well experienced in the blessings of freedom and\r\nundisturbed industry, to tolerate long a contrary state of things. I\r\nshould be happy to hear that their government perfects itself, and leaves\r\nroom for the honest, the industrious and wise; in which case, your own\r\ntalents, and those of the persons for whom you have interested yourself,\r\nwill, I am sure, find welcome and distinction. My good wishes will always\r\nattend you, as a consequence of the esteem and regard with which I am,\r\nDear Sir, your most obedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 27, 1795.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of March the 23d came to hand the 7th of April,\r\nand notwithstanding the urgent reasons for answering a part of it\r\nimmediately, yet as it mentioned that you would leave Philadelphia within\r\na few days, I feared that the answer might pass you on the road. A letter\r\nfrom Philadelphia by the last post having announced to me your leaving\r\nthat place the day preceding its date, I am in hopes this will find you\r\nin Orange. In mine, to which yours of March the 23d was an answer, I\r\nexpressed my hope of the only change of position I ever wished to see\r\nyou make, and I expressed it with entire sincerity, because there is\r\nnot another person in the United States, who being placed at the helm\r\nof our affairs, my mind would be so completely at rest for the fortune\r\nof our political bark. The wish too was pure, and unmixed with anything\r\nrespecting myself personally.\r\n\r\nFor as to myself, the subject had been thoroughly weighed and decided\r\non, and my retirement from office had been meant from all office high\r\nor low, without exception. I can say, too, with truth, that the subject\r\nhad not been presented to my mind by any vanity of my own. I know myself\r\nand my fellow citizens too well to have ever thought of it. But the idea\r\nwas forced upon me by continual insinuations in the public papers, while\r\nI was in office. As all these came from a hostile quarter, I knew that\r\ntheir object was to poison the public mind as to my motives, when they\r\nwere not able to charge me with facts. But the idea being once presented\r\nto me, my own quiet required that I should face it and examine it. I\r\ndid so thoroughly, and had no difficulty to see that every reason which\r\nhad determined me to retire from the office I then held, operated more\r\nstrongly against that which was insinuated to be my object. I decided\r\nthen on those general grounds which could alone be present to my mind\r\nat the time, that is to say, reputation, tranquillity, labor; for as\r\nto public duty, it could not be a topic of consideration in my case. If\r\nthese general considerations were sufficient to ground a firm resolution\r\nnever to permit myself to think of the office, or to be thought of for\r\nit, the special ones which have supervened on my retirement, still more\r\ninsuperably bar the door to it. My health is entirely broken down within\r\nthe last eight months; my age requires that I should place my affairs in a\r\nclear state; these are sound if taken care of, but capable of considerable\r\ndangers if longer neglected; and above all things, the delights I feel in\r\nthe society of my family, and in the agricultural pursuits in which I am\r\nso eagerly engaged. The little spice of ambition which I had in my younger\r\ndays has long since evaporated, and I set still less store by a posthumous\r\nthan present name. In stating to you the heads of reasons which have\r\nproduced my determination, I do not mean an opening for future discussion,\r\nor that I may be reasoned out of it. The question is forever closed with\r\nme; my sole object is to avail myself of the first opening ever given\r\nme from a friendly quarter (and I could not with decency do it before),\r\nof preventing any division or loss of votes, which might be fatal to the\r\nrepublican interest. If that has any chance of prevailing, it must be by\r\navoiding the loss of a single vote, and by concentrating all its strength\r\non one object. Who this should be, is a question I can more freely discuss\r\nwith anybody than yourself. In this I painfully feel the loss of Monroe.\r\nHad he been here, I should have been at no loss for a channel through\r\nwhich to make myself understood; if I have been misunderstood by anybody\r\nthrough the instrumentality of Mr. Fenno and his abettors. I long to see\r\nyou. I am proceeding in my agricultural plans with a slow but sure step.\r\nTo get under full way will require four or five years. But patience and\r\nperseverance will accomplish it. My little essay in red clover, the last\r\nyear, has had the most encouraging success. I sowed then about forty\r\nacres. I have sowed this year about one hundred and twenty, which the\r\nrain now falling comes very opportunely on. From one hundred and sixty\r\nto two hundred acres, will be my yearly sowing. The seed-box described in\r\nthe agricultural transactions of New York, reduces the expense of seeding\r\nfrom six shillings to two shillings and three pence the acre, and does\r\nthe business better than is possible to be done by the human hand. May we\r\nhope a visit from you? If we may, let it be after the middle of May, by\r\nwhich time I hope to be returned from Bedford. I have had a proposition to\r\nmeet Mr. Henry there this month, to confer on the subject of a convention,\r\nto the calling of which he is now become a convert. The session of\r\nour district court furnished me a just excuse for the time; but the\r\nimpropriety of my entering into consultation on a measure in which I would\r\ntake no part, is a permanent one.\r\n\r\nPresent my most respectful compliments to Mrs. Madison, and be assured of\r\nthe warm attachment of, Dear Sir, yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 27, 1795.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 16th came to hand by the last post. I\r\nsincerely congratulate you on the great prosperities of our two first\r\nallies, the French and Dutch. If I could but see them now at peace\r\nwith the rest of their continent, I should have little doubt of dining\r\nwith Pichegru in London, next autumn; for I believe I should be tempted\r\nto leave my clover for awhile, to go and hail the dawn of liberty and\r\nrepublicanism in that island. I shall be rendered very happy by the visit\r\nyou promise me. The only thing wanting to make me completely so, is the\r\nmore frequent society of my friends. It is the more wanting, as I am\r\nbecome more firmly fixed to the globe. If you visit me as a farmer, it\r\nmust be as a condisciple: for I am but a learner; an eager one indeed, but\r\nyet desperate, being too old now to learn a new art. However, I am as much\r\ndelighted and occupied with it, as if I was the greatest adept. I shall\r\ntalk with you about it from morning till night, and put you on very short\r\nallowance as to political aliment. Now and then a pious ejaculation for\r\nthe French and Dutch republicans, returning with due despatch to clover,\r\npotatoes, wheat, &c. That I may not lose the pleasure promised me, let it\r\nnot be till the middle of May, by which time I shall be returned from a\r\ntrip I meditated to Bedford. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MANN PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 30, 1795.\r\n\r\nIt was not in my power to attend at Fredericksburg according to the kind\r\ninvitation in your letter, and in that of Mr. Ogilvie. The heat of the\r\nweather, the business of the farm, to which I have made myself necessary,\r\nforbade it; and to give one round reason for all, _mature sanus_, I have\r\nlaid up my Rosinante in his stall, before his unfitness for the road shall\r\nexpose him faultering to the world. But why did not I answer you in time?\r\nBecause, in truth, I am encouraging myself to grow lazy, and I was sure\r\nyou would ascribe the delay to anything sooner than a want of affection\r\nor respect to you, for this was not among the possible causes. In truth,\r\nif anything could ever induce me to sleep another night out of my own\r\nhouse, it would have been your friendly invitation and my solicitude for\r\nthe subject of it, the education of our youth. I do most anxiously wish\r\nto see the highest degrees of education given to the higher degrees of\r\ngenius, and to all degrees of it, so much as may enable them to read and\r\nunderstand what is going on in the world, and to keep their part of it\r\ngoing on right: for nothing can keep it right but their own vigilant and\r\ndistrustful superintendence. I do not believe with the Rochefoucaults\r\nand Montaignes, that fourteen out of fifteen men are rogues: I believe\r\na great abatement from that proportion may be made in favor of general\r\nhonesty. But I have always found that rogues would be uppermost, and I\r\ndo not know that the proportion is too strong for the higher orders, and\r\nfor those who, rising above the swinish multitude, always contrive to\r\nnestle themselves into the places of power and profit. These rogues set\r\nout with stealing the people's good opinion, and then steal from them the\r\nright of withdrawing it, by contriving laws and associations against the\r\npower of the people themselves. Our part of the country is in considerable\r\nfermentation, on what they suspect to be a recent roguery of this kind.\r\nThey say that while all hands were below deck mending sails, splicing\r\nropes, and every one at his own business, and the captain in his cabin\r\nattending to his log book and chart, a rogue of a pilot has run them\r\ninto an enemy's port. But metaphor apart, there is much dissatisfaction\r\nwith Mr. Jay and his treaty. For my part, I consider myself now but as a\r\npassenger, leaving the world and its government to those who are likely\r\nto live longer in it. That you may be among the longest of these, is\r\nmy sincere prayer. After begging you to be the bearer of my compliments\r\nand apologies to Mr. Ogilvie, I bid you an affectionate farewell, always\r\nwishing to hear from you.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. TAZEWELL, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 13, 1795.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I ought much sooner to have acknowledged your obliging\r\nattention in sending me a copy of the treaty. It was the first we received\r\nin this part of the country. Though I have interdicted myself all serious\r\nattention to political matters, yet a very slight notice of that in\r\nquestion sufficed to decide my mind against it. I am not satisfied we\r\nshould not be better without treaties with any nation. But I am satisfied\r\nwe should be better without such as this. The public dissatisfaction\r\ntoo and dissension it is likely to produce, are serious evils. I am\r\nnot without hope that the operations on the 12th article may render a\r\nrecurrence to the Senate yet necessary, and so give to the majority an\r\nopportunity of correcting the error into which their exclusion of public\r\nlight has led them. I hope also that the recent results of the English\r\nwill at length awaken in our Executive that sense of public honor and\r\nspirit, which they have not lost sight of in their proceedings with other\r\nnations, and will establish the eternal truth that acquiescence under\r\ninsult is not the way to escape war. I am with great esteem, Dear Sir,\r\nyour most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 21, 1795.\r\n\r\nI received about three weeks ago, a box containing six dozen volumes, of\r\ntwo hundred and eighty-three pages, 12 mo, with a letter from Lambert,\r\nBeckley's clerk, that they came from Mr. Beckley, and were to be divided\r\nbetween yourself, J. Walker, and myself. I have sent two dozen to J.\r\nWalker, and shall be glad of a conveyance for yours. In the meantime,\r\nI send you by post, the title page, table of contents, and one of the\r\npieces, Curtius, lest it should not have come to you otherwise. It is\r\nevidently written by Hamilton, giving a first and general view of the\r\nsubject, that the public mind might be kept a little in check, till he\r\ncould resume the subject more at large from the beginning, under his\r\nsecond signature of Camillus. The piece called \"The Features of the\r\nTreaty,\" I do not send, because you have seen it in the newspapers. It\r\nis said to be written by Coxe, but I should rather suspect, by Beckley.\r\nThe antidote is certainly not strong enough for the poison of Curtius.\r\nIf I had not been informed the present came from Beckley, I should\r\nhave suspected it from Jay or Hamilton. I gave a copy or two, by way of\r\nexperiment, to honest, sound-hearted men of common understanding, and they\r\nwere not able to parry the sophistry of Curtius. I have ceased therefore,\r\nto give them. Hamilton is really a colossus to the anti-republican party.\r\nWithout numbers, he is an host within himself. They have got themselves\r\ninto a defile, where they might be finished; but too much security on the\r\nrepublican part will give time to his talents and indefatigableness to\r\nextricate them. We have had only middling performances to oppose to him.\r\nIn truth, when he comes forward, there is nobody but yourself who can\r\nmeet him. His adversaries having begun the attack, he has the advantage\r\nof answering them, and remains unanswered himself. A solid reply might\r\nyet completely demolish what was too feebly attacked, and has gathered\r\nstrength from the weakness of the attack. The merchants were certainly\r\n(except those of them who are English) as open mouthed at first against\r\nthe treaty, as any. But the general expression of indignation has alarmed\r\nthem for the strength of the government. They have feared the shock would\r\nbe too great, and have chosen to tack about and support both treaty and\r\ngovernment, rather than risk the government. Thus it is, that Hamilton,\r\nJay, &c., in the boldest act they ever ventured on to undermine the\r\ngovernment, have the address to screen themselves, and direct the hue and\r\ncry against those who wish to drag them into light. A bolder party-stroke\r\nwas never struck. For it certainly is an attempt of a party, who find\r\nthey have lost their majority in one branch of the Legislature, to make a\r\nlaw by the aid of the other branch and of the executive, under color of\r\na treaty, which shall bind up the hands of the adverse branch from ever\r\nrestraining the commerce of their patron-nation. There appears a pause\r\nat present in the public sentiment, which may be followed by a revulsion.\r\nThis is the effect of the desertion of the merchants, of the President's\r\nchiding answer to Boston and Richmond, of the writings of Curtius and\r\nCamillus, and of the quietism into which people naturally fall after\r\nfirst sensations are over. For God's sake take up your pen, and give a\r\nfundamental reply to Curtius and Camillus. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MONSIEUR ODIT.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 14, 1795.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received with pleasure your letter of the 9th ult., by post, but\r\nshould with greater pleasure have received it from your own hand, that\r\nI might have had an opportunity of testifying to you in person the great\r\nrespect I bear for your character, which had come to us before you, and\r\nof expressing my obligations to Professor Pictet, for procuring me the\r\nhonor of your acquaintance. It would have been a circumstance of still\r\nhigher satisfaction and advantage to me, if fortune had timed the periods\r\nof our service together, so that the drudgery of public business, which\r\nI always hated, might have been relieved by conversations with you on\r\nsubjects which I always loved, and particularly in learning from you the\r\nnew advances of science on the other side the Atlantic. The interests of\r\nour two republics also could not but have been promoted by the harmony\r\nof their servants. Two people whose interests, whose principles, whose\r\nhabits of attachment, founded on fellowship in war and mutual kindnesses,\r\nhave so many points of union, cannot but be easily kept together. I hope\r\nyou have accordingly been sensible, Sir, of the general interest which\r\nmy countrymen take in all the successes of your republic. In this no one\r\njoins with more enthusiasm than myself, an enthusiasm kindled by our love\r\nof liberty, by my gratitude to your nation who helped us to acquire it,\r\nby my wishes to see it extended to all men, and first to those whom we\r\nlove most. I am now a private man, free to express my feelings, and their\r\nexpression will be estimated at neither more or less than they weigh,\r\nto wit, the expressions of a private man. Your struggles for liberty\r\nkeep alive the only sparks of sensation which public affairs now excite\r\nin me. As to the concerns of my own country, I leave them willingly and\r\nsafely to those who will have a longer interest in cherishing them. My\r\nbooks, my family, my friends, and my farm, furnish more than enough to\r\noccupy me the remainder of my life, and of that tranquil occupation most\r\nanalogous to my physical and moral constitution. The correspondence you\r\nare pleased to invite me to on the natural history of my country, cannot\r\nbut be profitable and acceptable to me. My long absence from it, indeed,\r\nhas deprived me of the means of throwing any new lights on it; but I shall\r\nhave the benefit of participating of your views of it, and occasions of\r\nexpressing to you those sentiments of esteem and respect with which I have\r\nthe honor to be, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\nMONTICELLO, November 30, 1795.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I received your favor of October the 12th by your son,\r\nwho has been kind enough to visit me here, and from whose visit I have\r\nreceived all that pleasure which I do from whatever comes from you, and\r\nespecially from a subject so deservedly dear to you. He found me in a\r\nretirement I doat on, living like an antediluvian patriarch among my\r\nchildren and grand children, and tilling my soil. As he had lately come\r\nfrom Philadelphia, Boston, &c., he was able to give me a great deal of\r\ninformation of what is passing in the world, and I pestered him with\r\nquestions pretty much as our friends Lynch, Nelson, &c., will us, when we\r\nstep across the Styx, for they will wish to know what has been passing\r\nabove ground since they left us. You hope I have not abandoned entirely\r\nthe service of our country. After five and twenty years' continual\r\nemployment in it, I trust it will be thought I have fulfilled my tour,\r\nlike a punctual soldier, and may claim my discharge. But I am glad of the\r\nsentiment from you, my friend, because it gives a hope you will practice\r\nwhat you preach, and come forward in aid of the public vessel. I will not\r\nadmit your old excuse, that you are in public service though at home. The\r\ncampaigns which are fought in a man's own house are not to be counted.\r\nThe present situation of the President, unable to get the offices filled,\r\nreally calls with uncommon obligation on those whom nature has fitted for\r\nthem. I join with you in thinking the treaty an execrable thing. But both\r\nnegotiators must have understood, that, as there were articles in it which\r\ncould not be carried into execution without the aid of the Legislatures\r\non both sides, therefore it must be referred to them, and that these\r\nLegislatures being free agents, would not give it their support if they\r\ndisapproved of it. I trust the popular branch of our Legislature will\r\ndisapprove of it, and thus rid us of this infamous act, which is really\r\nnothing more than a treaty of alliance between England and the Anglomen of\r\nthis country, against the Legislature and people of the United States. I\r\nam, my dear friend, yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 31, 1795.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favors of December the 15th and 20th came to hand by the\r\nlast post. I am well pleased with the manner in which your House have\r\ntestified their sense of the treaty; while their refusal to pass the\r\noriginal clause of the reported answer proved their condemnation of it,\r\nthe contrivance to let it disappear silently respected appearances in\r\nfavor of the President, who errs as other men do, but errs with integrity.\r\nRandolph seems to have hit upon the true theory of our Constitution; that\r\nwhen a treaty is made, involving matters confided by the Constitution to\r\nthe three branches of the Legislature conjointly, the Representatives\r\nare as free as the President and Senate were, to consider whether the\r\nnational interest requires or forbids their giving the forms and force of\r\nlaw to the articles over which they have a power. I thank you much for the\r\npamphlet. His narrative is so straight and plain, that even those who did\r\nnot know him will acquit him of the charge of bribery. Those who knew him\r\nhad done it from the first. Though he mistakes his own political character\r\nin the aggregate, yet he gives it to you in the detail. Thus, he supposes\r\nhimself a man of no party (page 57); that his opinions not containing any\r\nsystematic adherence to party, fell sometimes on one side and sometimes\r\non the other (page 58). Yet he gives you these facts, which show that they\r\nfall generally on both sides, and are complete inconsistencies.\r\n\r\n1. He never gave an opinion in the cabinet against the rights of the\r\npeople (page 97); yet he advised the denunciation of the popular societies\r\n(page 67).\r\n\r\n2. He would not neglect the overtures of a commercial treaty with France\r\n(page 79); yet he always opposed it while Attorney General, and never\r\nseems to have proposed it while Secretary of State.\r\n\r\n3. He concurs in resorting to the militia to quell the pretended\r\ninsurrections in the west (page 81), and proposes an augmentation from\r\ntwelve thousand five hundred to fifteen thousand, to march against men\r\nat their ploughs (page 80); yet on the 5th of August he is against their\r\nmarching (pages 83, 101), and on the 25th of August he is for it (page\r\n84).\r\n\r\n4. He concurs in the measure of a mission extraordinary to London (as is\r\ninferred from page 58), but objects to the men, to wit, Hamilton and Jay\r\n(page 50).\r\n\r\n5. He was against granting commercial powers to Mr. Jay (page 58); yet he\r\nbesieged the doors of the Senate to procure their advice to ratify.\r\n\r\n6. He advises the President to a ratification on the merits of the treaty\r\n(page 97), but to a suspension till the provision order is repealed (page\r\n98). The fact is, that he has generally given his principles to the one\r\nparty, and his practice to the other, the oyster to one, the shell to\r\nthe other. Unfortunately, the shell was generally the lot of his friends,\r\nthe French and republicans, and the oyster of their antagonists. Had he\r\nbeen firm to the principles he professes in the year 1793, the President\r\nwould have been kept from an habitual concert with the British and\r\nanti-republican party. But at that time, I do not know which R. feared\r\nmost, a British fleet, or French disorganizers. Whether his conduct is to\r\nbe ascribed to a superior view of things, an adherence to right without\r\nregard to party, as he pretends, or to an anxiety to trim between both,\r\nthose who know his character and capacity will decide. Were parties here\r\ndivided merely by a greediness for office, as in England, to take a part\r\nwith either would be unworthy of a reasonable or moral man. But where the\r\nprinciple of difference is as substantial, and as strongly pronounced\r\nas between the republicans and the monocrats of our country, I hold it\r\nas honorable to take a firm and decided part, and as immoral to pursue a\r\nmiddle line, as between the parties of honest men and rogues, into which\r\nevery country is divided.\r\n\r\nA copy of the pamphlet came by this post to Charlottesville. I suppose we\r\nshall be able to judge soon what kind of impression it is likely to make.\r\nIt has been a great treat to me, as it is a continuation of that cabinet\r\nhistory, with the former part of which I was intimate. I remark, in the\r\nreply of the President a small travestie of the sentiment contained in the\r\nanswer of the Representatives. They acknowledge that he has _contributed_\r\na great share to the national happiness by his services. He thanks them\r\nfor ascribing to his _agency_ a great share of those benefits. The former\r\nkeeps in view the co-operation of others towards the public good. The\r\nlatter presents to view his sole agency. At a time when there would have\r\nbeen less anxiety to publish to the people a strong approbation from your\r\nHouse, this strengthening of your expression would not have been noticed.\r\n\r\nOur attentions have been so absorbed by the first manifestation of the\r\nsentiments of your House, that we have lost sight of our own Legislature;\r\ninsomuch, that I do not know whether they are sitting or not. The\r\nrejection of Mr. Rutledge by the Senate is a bold thing; because they\r\ncannot pretend any objection to him but his disapprobation of the treaty.\r\nIt is, of course, a declaration that they will receive none but tories\r\nhereafter into any department of the government. I should not wonder if\r\nMonroe were to be re-called, under the idea of his being of the partisans\r\nof France, whom the President considers as the partisans of _war and\r\nconfusion_, in his letter of July the 31st, and as disposed to excite\r\nthem to hostile measures, or at least to unfriendly sentiments; a most\r\ninfatuated blindness to the true character of the sentiments entertained\r\nin favor of France. The bottom of my page warns me that it is time to end\r\nmy commentaries on the facts you have furnished me. You would of course,\r\nhowever, wish to know the sensations here on those facts.\r\n\r\nMy friendly respects to Mr. Madison, to whom the next week's dose will be\r\ndirected. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. WYTHE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 16, 1796.\r\n\r\nIn my letter which accompanied the box containing my collection of\r\nprinted laws, I promised to send you by post a statement of the contents\r\nof the box. On taking up the subject I found it better to take a more\r\ngeneral review of the whole of the laws I possessed, as well manuscript\r\nas printed, as also of those which I do not possess, and suppose to be\r\nno longer extant. This general view you will have in the enclosed paper,\r\nwhereof the articles stated to be printed constitute the contents of the\r\nbox I sent you. Those in manuscript were not sent, because not supposed\r\nto have been within your view, and because some of them will not bear\r\nremoval, being so rotten, that in turning over a leaf it sometimes falls\r\ninto powder. These I preserve by wrapping and sewing them up in oil cloth,\r\nso that neither air nor moisture can have access to them. Very early in\r\nthe course of my researches into the laws of Virginia, I observed that\r\nmany of them were already lost, and many more on the point of being lost,\r\nas existing only in single copies in the hands of careful or curious\r\nindividuals, on whose death they would probably be used for waste paper. I\r\nset myself therefore to work, to collect all which were then existing, in\r\norder that when the day should come in which the public should advert to\r\nthe magnitude of their loss in these precious monuments of our property,\r\nand our history, a part of their regret might be spared by information\r\nthat a portion had been saved from the wreck, which is worthy of their\r\nattention and preservation. In searching after these remains, I spared\r\nneither time, trouble, nor expense; and am of opinion that scarcely any\r\nlaw escaped me, which was in being as late as the year 1790 in the middle\r\nor southern parts of the State. In the northern parts, perhaps something\r\nmight still be found. In the clerk's offices in the ancient counties, some\r\nof these manuscript copies of the laws may possibly still exist, which\r\nused to be furnished at the public expense to every county, before the\r\nuse of the press was introduced; and in the same places, and in the hands\r\nof ancient magistrates or of their families, some of the fugitive sheets\r\nof the laws of separate sessions, which have been usually distributed\r\nsince the practice commenced of printing them. But recurring to what we\r\nactually possess, the question is, what means will be the most effectual\r\nfor preserving these remains from future loss? All the care I can take\r\nof them, will not preserve them from the worm, from the natural decay\r\nof the paper, from the accidents of fire, or those of removal when it is\r\nnecessary for any public purposes, as in the case of those now sent you.\r\nOur experience has proved to us that a single copy, or a few, deposited\r\nin manuscript in the public offices, cannot be relied on for any great\r\nlength of time. The ravages of fire and of ferocious enemies have had but\r\ntoo much part in producing the very loss we are now deploring. How many\r\nof the precious works of antiquity were lost while they were preserved\r\nonly in manuscript! has there ever been one lost since the art of printing\r\nhas rendered it practicable to multiply and disperse copies? This leads\r\nus then to the only means of preserving those remains of our laws now\r\nunder consideration, that is, a multiplication of printed copies. I think\r\ntherefore that there should be printed at public expense, an edition of\r\nall the laws ever passed by our legislatures which can now be found; that\r\na copy should be deposited in every public library in America, in the\r\nprincipal public offices within the State, and some perhaps in the most\r\ndistinguished public libraries of Europe, and the rest should be sold to\r\nindividuals, towards reimbursing the expenses of the edition. Nor do I\r\nthink that this would be a voluminous work. The MSS. would furnish matter\r\nfor one printed volume in folio, would comprehend all the laws from 1624\r\nto 1701, which period includes Pervis. My collection of fugitive sheets\r\nforms, as we know, two volumes, and comprehends all the extant laws from\r\n1734 to 1783; and the laws which can be gleaned up from the Revivals to\r\nsupply the chasm between 1701 and 1734, with those from 1783 to the close\r\nof the present century, (by which term the work might be completed,) would\r\nnot be more than the matter of another volume. So that four volumes in\r\nfolio, would give every law ever passed which is now extant; whereas those\r\nwho wish to possess as many of them as can be procured, must now buy the\r\nsix folio volumes of Revivals, to wit, Pervis and those of 1732, 1784,\r\n1768, 1783, and 1794, and in all of them possess not one half of which\r\nthey wish. What would be the expense of the edition I cannot say, nor how\r\nmuch would be reimbursed by the sales; but I am sure it would be moderate,\r\ncompared with the rates which the public have hitherto paid for printing\r\ntheir laws, provided a sufficient latitude be given as to printers and\r\nplaces. The first step would be to make out a single copy from the MSS.,\r\nwhich would employ a clerk about a year or something more, to which\r\nexpense about a fourth should be added for collation of the MSS., which\r\nwould employ three persons at a time about half a day, or a day in every\r\nweek. As I have already spent more time in making myself acquainted with\r\nthe contents and arrangement of these MSS. than any other person probably\r\never will, and their condition does not admit their removal to a distance,\r\nI will cheerfully undertake the direction and superintendence of this\r\nwork, if it can be done in the neighboring towns of Charlottesville or\r\nMilton, farther than which I could not undertake to go from home. For the\r\nresidue of the work, my printed volumes might be delivered to the printer.\r\n\r\nI have troubled you with these details, because you are in the place where\r\nthey may be used for the public service, if they admit of such use, and\r\nbecause the order of assembly, which you mention, shows they are sensible\r\nof the necessity of preserving such of these laws as relate to our landed\r\nproperty; and a little further consideration will perhaps convince them\r\nthat it is better to do the whole work once for all, than to be recurring\r\nto it by piece-meal, as particular parts of it shall be required, and\r\nthat too perhaps when the materials shall be lost. You are the best judge\r\nof the weight of these observations, and of the mode of giving them any\r\neffect they may merit. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, March 6, 1796.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you February the 21st, since which I have received\r\nyours of the same day. Indeed, mine of that date related only to a single\r\narticle in yours of January the 31st and February the 7th. I do not at\r\nall wonder at the condition in which the finances of the United States are\r\nfound. Hamilton's object from the beginning, was to throw them into forms\r\nwhich should be utterly undecypherable. I ever said he did not understand\r\ntheir condition himself, nor was able to give a clear view of the excess\r\nof our debts beyond our credits, nor whether we were diminishing or\r\nincreasing the debt. My own opinion was, that from the commencement of\r\nthis government to the time I ceased to attend to the subject, we had been\r\nincreasing our debt about a million of dollars annually. If Mr. Gallatin\r\nwould undertake to reduce this chaos to order, present us with a clear\r\nview of our finances, and put them into a form as simple as they will\r\nadmit, he will merit immortal honor. The accounts of the United States\r\nought to be, and may be made as simple as those of a common farmer, and\r\ncapable of being understood by common farmers.\r\n\r\nDisapproving, as I do, of the unjustifiable largess to the demands of\r\nthe Count de Grasse, I will certainly not propose to rivet it by a second\r\nexample on behalf of M. de Chastellux's son. It will only be done in the\r\nevent of such a repetition of the precedent, as will give every one a\r\nright to share in the plunder. It is, indeed, surprising you have not yet\r\nreceived the British treaty in form. I presume you would never receive\r\nit were not your co-operation on it necessary. But this will oblige the\r\nformal notification of it to you.\r\n\r\nMy salutations to Mrs. Madison, friendly esteem to Mr. Giles, Page, &c. I\r\nam, with sincere affection, yours.\r\n\r\nP. S. Have you considered all the consequences of your proposition\r\nrespecting post roads? I view it as a source of boundless patronage to\r\nthe executive, jobbing to members of Congress and their friends, and a\r\nbottomless abyss of public money. You will begin by only appropriating the\r\nsurplus of the post office revenues; but the other revenues will soon be\r\ncalled into their aid, and it will be a source of eternal scramble among\r\nthe members, who can get the most money wasted in their State; and they\r\nwill always get most who are meanest. We have thought, hitherto, that\r\nthe roads of a State could not be so well administered even by the State\r\nlegislature as by the magistracy of the county, on the spot. How will\r\nthey be when a member of New Hampshire is to mark out a road for Georgia?\r\nDoes the power to _establish_ post roads, given you by the Constitution,\r\nmean that you shall _make_ the roads, or only _select_ from those already\r\nmade, those on which there shall be a post? If the term be equivocal,\r\n(and I really do not think it so,) which is the safest construction? That\r\nwhich permits a majority of Congress to go to cutting down mountains and\r\nbridging of rivers, or the other, which if too restricted may be referred\r\nto the States for amendment, securing still due measures and proportion\r\namong us, and providing some means of information to the members of\r\nCongress tantamount to that ocular inspection, which, even in our county\r\ndeterminations, the magistrate finds cannot be supplied by any other\r\nevidence? The fortification of harbors was liable to great objection. But\r\nnational circumstances furnished some color. In this case there is none.\r\nThe roads of America are the best in the world except those of France and\r\nEngland. But does the state of our population, the extent of our internal\r\ncommerce, the want of sea and river navigation, call for such expense\r\non roads here, or are our means adequate to it? Think of all this, and\r\na great deal more which your good judgment will suggest, and pardon my\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\n                                                            March 19, 1796.\r\n\r\nI know not when I have received greater satisfaction than on reading the\r\nspeech of Dr. Leib, in the Pennsylvania Assembly. He calls himself a new\r\nmember. I congratulate honest republicanism on such an acquisition, and\r\npromise myself much from a career which begins on such elevated ground.\r\nWe are in suspense here to see the fate and effect of Mr. Pitt's bill\r\nagainst democratic societies. I wish extremely to get at the true history\r\nof this effort to suppress freedom of meeting, speaking, writing and\r\nprinting. Your acquaintance with Sedgwick will enable you to do it. Pray\r\nget the outlines of the bill he intended to have brought in for this\r\npurpose. This will enable us to judge whether we have the merit of the\r\ninvention; whether we were really beforehand with the British minister on\r\nthis subject; whether he took his hint from our proposition, or whether\r\nthe concurrence in the sentiment is merely the result of the general\r\ntruth that great men will think alike and act alike, though without\r\nintercommunication. I am serious in desiring extremely the outlines of\r\nthe bill intended for us. From the debates on the subject of our seamen,\r\nI am afraid as much harm as good will be done by our endeavors to arm our\r\nseamen against impressments. It is proposed to register them and give them\r\ncertificates. But these certificates will be lost in a thousand ways; a\r\nsailor will neglect to take his certificate; he is wet twenty times in\r\na voyage; if he goes ashore without it, he is impressed; if with it, he\r\ngets drunk, it is lost, stolen from him, taken from him, and then the\r\nwant of it gives authority to impress, which does not exist now. After ten\r\nyears' attention to the subject, I have never been able to devise anything\r\neffectual, but that the circumstance of an American bottom be made _ipso\r\nfacto_, a protection for a number of seamen proportioned to her tonnage;\r\nthat American captains be obliged, when called on by foreign officers,\r\nto parade the men on deck, which would show whether they exceeded their\r\nown quota, and allow the foreign officer to send two or three persons\r\naboard and hunt for any suspected to be concealed. This, Mr. Pinckney\r\nwas instructed to insist upon with Great Britain; to accept of nothing\r\nshort of it; and, most especially, not to agree that a certificate of\r\ncitizenship should be requirable from our seamen; because it would be made\r\na ground for the authorized impressment of them. I am still satisfied that\r\nsuch a protection will place them in a worse situation than they are at\r\npresent. It is true, the British minister has not shown any disposition\r\nto accede to my proposition: but it was not totally rejected: and if\r\nhe still refuses, lay a duty of one penny sterling a yard on British\r\noznaburgs, to make a fund for paying the expenses of the agents you are\r\nobliged to employ to seek out our suffering seamen. I congratulate you on\r\nthe arrival of Mr. Ames and the British treaty. The newspapers had said\r\nthey would arrive together. We have had a fine winter. Wheat looks well.\r\nCorn is scarce and dear. Twenty-two shillings here, thirty shillings in\r\nAmherst. Our blossoms are but just opening. I have begun the demolition\r\nof my house, and hope to get through its re-edification in the course of\r\nthe summer. We shall have the eye of a brick-kiln to poke you into, or an\r\noctagon to air you in. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 21, 1796.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 2d instant, and now take the liberty of\r\ntroubling you, in order to have the enclosed letter to M. Gautier safely\r\nhanded to him. I will thank you for information that it gets safely to\r\nhand, as it is of considerable importance to him, to the United States,\r\nto the State of Virginia, and to myself, by conveying to him the final\r\narrangement of the accounts of Grand and Company with all those parties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe British treaty has been formally, at length, laid before Congress.\r\nAll America is a tiptoe to see what the House of Representatives will\r\ndecide on it. We conceive the constitutional doctrine to be, that though\r\nthe President and Senate have the general power of making treaties, yet\r\nwherever they include in a treaty matters confided by the Constitution to\r\nthe three branches of Legislature, an act of legislation will be requisite\r\nto confirm these articles, and that the House of Representatives, as\r\none branch of the Legislature, are perfectly free to pass the act or\r\nto refuse it, governing themselves by their own judgment whether it is\r\nfor the good of their constituents to let the treaty go into effect or\r\nnot. On the precedent now to be set will depend the future construction\r\nof our Constitution, and whether the powers of legislation shall be\r\ntransferred from the President, Senate, and House of Representatives, to\r\nthe President and Senate, and Piamingo or any other Indian, Algerine, or\r\nother chief. It is fortunate that the first decision is to be in a case\r\nso palpably atrocious, as to have been predetermined by all America. The\r\nappointment of Elsworth Chief Justice, and Chase one of the judges, is\r\ndoubtless communicated to you. My friendly respects to Mrs. Monroe. Adieu\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 27, 1796.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am much pleased with Mr. Gallatin's speech in Bache's\r\npaper of March the 14th. It is worthy of being printed at the end of\r\nthe Federalist, as the only rational commentary on the part of the\r\nConstitution to which it relates. Not that there may not be objections,\r\nand difficult ones, to it, and which I shall be glad to see his answers\r\nto; but if they are never answered, they are more easily to be gulped\r\ndown than those which lie to the doctrines of his opponents, which do in\r\nfact annihilate the whole of the powers given by the Constitution to the\r\nLegislature. According to the rule established by usage and common sense,\r\nof construing one part of the instrument by another, the objects on which\r\nthe President and Senate may exclusively act by treaty are much reduced,\r\nbut the field on which they may act with the sanction of the Legislature,\r\nis large enough; and I see no harm in rendering their sanction necessary,\r\nand not much harm in annihilating the whole treaty-making power, except\r\nas to making peace. If you decide in favor of your right to refuse\r\nco-operation in any case of treaty, I should wonder on what occasion it\r\nis to be used, if not in one where the rights, the interest, the honor\r\nand faith of our nation are so grossly sacrificed; where a faction has\r\nentered into a conspiracy with the enemies of their country to chain\r\ndown the Legislature at the feet of both; where the whole mass of your\r\nconstituents have condemned this work in the most unequivocal manner, and\r\nare looking to you as their last hope to save them from the effects of the\r\navarice and corruption of the first agent, the revolutionary machinations\r\nof others, and the incomprehensible acquiescence of the only honest man\r\nwho has assented to it. I wish that his honesty and his political errors\r\nmay not furnish a second occasion to exclaim, \"curse on his virtues, they\r\nhave undone his country.\" Cold weather, mercury at twenty degrees in the\r\nmorning. Corn fallen at Richmond to twenty shillings; stationary here;\r\nNicholas sure of his election; R. Jouett and Jo. Monroe in competition for\r\nthe other vote of the county. Affection to Mrs. M. and yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 19, 1796.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 4th instant came to hand the day before yesterday.\r\nI have turned to the conventional history, and enclose you an exact copy\r\nof what is there on the subject you mentioned. I have also turned to my\r\nown papers, and send you some things extracted from them, which show that\r\nthe recollection of the President has not been accurate, when he supposed\r\nhis own opinion to have been uniformly that declared in his answer of\r\nMarch the 30th. The records of the Senate will vouch for this. My respects\r\nto Mrs. Madison. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n               [The papers referred to in the preceding.]\r\n\r\n     _Extract, verbatim, from last page but one and the last page._\r\n\r\n\"Mr. King suggested that the journals of the Convention should be either\r\ndestroyed, or deposited in the custody of the President. He thought, if\r\nsuffered to be make public, a bad use would be made of them by those who\r\nwould wish to prevent the adoption of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wilson preferred the second expedient. He had at one time liked the\r\nfirst best; but as false suggestions may be propagated, it should not be\r\nmade impossible to contradict them.\r\n\r\n\"A question was then put on depositing the journals and other papers of\r\nthe Convention in the hands of the President, on which New Hampshire, aye,\r\nMassachusetts, aye, Connecticut, aye, New Jersey, aye, Pennsylvania, aye,\r\nDelaware, aye, Maryland, no, Virginia, aye, North Carolina, aye, South\r\nCarolina, aye, and Georgia, aye. This negative of Maryland was occasioned\r\nby the language of the instructions to the Deputies of that State, which\r\nrequired them to report to the State the _proceedings_ of the Convention.\r\n\r\n\"The President having asked what the Convention meant should be done with\r\nthe journals, &c., whether copies were to be allowed to the members, if\r\napplied for, it was resolved _nem. con._ that he retain the journal and\r\nother papers subject to the order of the Congress, if ever formed under\r\nthe Constitution.\"\r\n\r\n\"The members then proceeded to sign the instrument,\" &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In the Senate, February 1, 1791.\r\n\r\n\"The committee, to whom was referred that part of the speech of the\r\nPresident of the United States, at the opening of the session, which\r\nrelates to the commerce of the Mediterranean, and also the letter from\r\nthe Secretary of State, dated the 20th of January, 1791, with the papers\r\naccompanying the same, reported: whereupon,\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the Senate do advise and consent, that the President\r\nof the United States take such measures as he may think necessary for\r\nthe redemption of the citizens of the United States, now in captivity at\r\nAlgiers, provided the expense shall not exceed forty thousand dollars, and\r\nalso, that measures be taken to confirm the treaty now existing between\r\nthe United States and the Emperor of Morocco.\"\r\n\r\nThe above is a copy of a resolve of the Senate, referred to me by the\r\nPresident, to propose an answer to, and I find immediately following\r\nthis, among my papers, a press copy, from an original written fairly in my\r\nown hand, ready for the President's signature, and to be given in to the\r\nSenate, of the following answer:\r\n\r\n    \"_Gentlemen of the Senate_,--\r\n\r\n    \"I will proceed to take measures for the ransom of our citizens in\r\n    captivity at Algiers, in conformity with your resolution of advice\r\n    of the 1st instant, so soon as the moneys necessary shall be\r\n    appropriated _by the Legislature_, and shall be in readiness.\r\n\r\n    \"The recognition of our treaty with the new Emperor of Morocco\r\n    requires also previous appropriation and provision. The importance\r\n    of this last to the liberty and property of our citizens, induces\r\n    me to urge it on your earliest attention.\"\r\n\r\n    Though I have no memorandum of the delivery of this to the Senate,\r\n    yet I have not the least doubt it was given in to them, and will\r\n    be found among their records.\r\n\r\n    I find, among my press copies, the following in my hand writing:\r\n\r\n    \"The committee to report, that the President does not think that\r\n    circumstances will justify, in the present instance, his entering\r\n    into _absolute_ engagements for the ransom of our captives in\r\n    Algiers, nor calling for money from the treasury, nor raising it\r\n    by loan, without previous authority from _both branches_ of the\r\n    Legislature.\"\r\n\r\n    April 9, 1792.\r\n\r\nI do not recollect the occasion of the above paper with certainty; but\r\nI think there was a committee appointed by the Senate to confer with\r\nthe President on the subject of the ransom, and to advise what is there\r\ndeclined, and that a member of the committee advising privately with me as\r\nto the report they were to make to the House, I minuted down the above, as\r\nthe substance of what he observed to be the proper report, after what had\r\npassed with the President, and gave the original to the member, preserving\r\nthe press copy. I think the member was either Mr. Izard or Mr. Butler, and\r\nhave no doubt such a report will be found on the files of the Senate.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May following, in consequence of questions proposed by the\r\nPresident to the Senate, they came to a resolution, on which a mission was\r\nfounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. MAZZEI.[4]\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, April 24, 1796.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe aspect of our politics has wonderfully changed since you left\r\nus. In place of that noble love of liberty and republican government\r\nwhich carried us triumphantly through the war, an Anglican monarchical\r\naristocratical party has sprung up, whose avowed object is to draw over\r\nus the substance, as they have already done the forms, of the British\r\ngovernment. The main body of our citizens, however, remain true to their\r\nrepublican principles; the whole landed interest is republican, and so\r\nis a great mass of talents. Against us are the Executive, the Judiciary,\r\ntwo out of three branches of the Legislature, all the officers of the\r\ngovernment, all who want to be officers, all timid men who prefer the\r\ncalm of despotism to the boisterous sea of liberty, British merchants\r\nand Americans trading on British capitals, speculators and holders in\r\nthe banks and public funds, a contrivance invented for the purposes of\r\ncorruption, and for assimilating us in all things to the rotten as well\r\nas the sound parts of the British model. It would give you a fever were\r\nI to name to you the apostates who have gone over to these heresies, men\r\nwho were Samsons in the field and Solomons in the council, but who have\r\nhad their heads shorn by the harlot England. In short, we are likely\r\nto preserve the liberty we have obtained only by unremitting labors and\r\nperils. But we shall preserve it; and our mass of weight and wealth on\r\nthe good side is so great, as to leave no danger that force will ever\r\nbe attempted against us. We have only to awake and snap the Lilliputian\r\ncords with which they have been entangling us during the first sleep which\r\nsucceeded our labors.\r\n\r\nI will forward the testimonial of the death of Mrs. Mazzei, which I can\r\ndo the more incontrovertibly as she is buried in my grave yard, and I\r\npass her grave daily. The formalities of the proof you require, will\r\noccasion delay. I begin to feel the effects of age. My health has suddenly\r\nbroken down, with symptoms which give me to believe I shall not have much\r\nto encounter of the _tedium vita_. While it remains, however, my heart\r\nwill be warm in its friendships, and among these, will always foster the\r\naffections with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [4] [The first part of this letter is on private business, and is\r\n        therefore omitted.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 12, 1796.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCongress have risen. You will have seen by their proceedings the truth\r\nof what I always observed to you, that one man outweighs them all in the\r\ninfluence over the people, who have supported his judgment against their\r\nown and that of their representatives. Republicanism must lie on its oars,\r\nresign the vessel to its pilot, and themselves to the course he thinks\r\nbest for them. I had always conjectured, from such facts as I could get\r\nhold of, that our public debt was increasing about a million of dollars\r\na year. You will see by Gallatin's speeches that the thing is proved.\r\nYou will see further, that we are completely saddled and bridled, and\r\nthat the bank is so firmly mounted on us that we must go where they will\r\nguide. They openly publish a resolution, that the national property being\r\nincreased in value, they must by an increase of circulating medium furnish\r\nan adequate representation of it, and by further additions of active\r\ncapital promote the enterprises of our merchants. It is supposed that\r\nthe paper in circulation in and around Philadelphia, amounts to twenty\r\nmillions of dollars, and that in the whole Union, to one hundred millions.\r\nI think the last too high. All the imported commodities are raised about\r\nfifty per cent. by the depreciation of the money. Tobacco shares the rise,\r\nbecause it has no competition abroad. Wheat has been extraordinarily high\r\nfrom other causes. When these cease, it must fall to its ancient nominal\r\nprice, notwithstanding the depreciation of that, because it must contend\r\nin market with foreign wheats. Lands had risen within the vortex of the\r\npaper, and as far out as that can influence. They have not risen at all\r\nhere. On the contrary, they are lower than they were twenty years ago.\r\nThose I had mentioned to you, to wit, Carter's and Colle, were sold before\r\nyour letter came. Colle at two dollars the acre. Carter's had been offered\r\nme for two French crowns (13s. 2d). Mechanics here get from a dollar to a\r\ndollar and a half a day, yet are much worse off than at the old prices.\r\n\r\nVolney is with me at present. He is on his way to the Illinois. Some late\r\nappointments, judiciary and diplomatic, you will have heard, and stared\r\nat. The death of R. Jouett is the only small news in our neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOur best affections attend Mrs. Monroe, Eliza and yourself. Adieu\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 19, 1796.\r\n\r\nIn Bache's Aurora, of the 9th instant, which came here by the last post,\r\na paper appears, which, having been confided, as I presume, to but few\r\nhands, makes it truly wonderful how it should have got there. I cannot\r\nbe satisfied as to my own part, till I relieve my mind by declaring, and\r\nI attest everything sacred and honorable to the declaration, that it has\r\ngot there neither through me nor the paper confided to me. This has never\r\nbeen from under my own lock and key, or out of my own hands. No mortal\r\never knew from me, that these questions had been proposed. Perhaps I\r\nought to except one person, who possesses all my confidence, as he has\r\npossessed yours. I do not remember, indeed, that I communicated it even\r\nto him. But as I was in the habit of unlimited trust and council with\r\nhim, it is possible I may have read it to him; no more: for the quire of\r\nwhich it makes a part was never in any hand but my own, nor was a word\r\never copied or taken down from it, by any body. I take on myself, without\r\nfear, any divulgation on his part. We both know him incapable of it. From\r\nmyself, then, or my papers, this publication has never been derived. I\r\nhave formerly mentioned to you, that from a very early period of my life,\r\nI had laid it down as a rule of conduct, never to write a word for the\r\npublic papers. From this, I have never departed in a single instance;\r\nand on a late occasion, when all the world seemed to be writing, besides\r\na rigid adherence to my own rule, I can say with truth, that not a line\r\nfor the press was ever communicated to me, by any other, except a single\r\npetition referred for my correction; which I did not correct, however,\r\nthough the contrary, as I have heard, was said in a public place, by one\r\nperson through error, through malice by another. I learn that this last\r\nhas thought it worth his while to try to sow tares between you and me,\r\nby representing me as still engaged in the bustle of politics, and in\r\nturbulence and intrigue against the government. I never believed for a\r\nmoment that this could make any impression on you, or that your knowledge\r\nof me would not overweigh the slander of an intriguer, dirtily employed\r\nin sifting the conversations of my table, where alone he could hear\r\nof me; and seeking to atone for his sins against you by sins against\r\nanother, who had never done him any other injury than that of declining\r\nhis confidences. Political conversations I really dislike, and therefore\r\navoid where I can without affectation. But when urged by others, I have\r\nnever conceived that having been in public life requires me to belie\r\nmy sentiments, or even to conceal them. When I am led by conversation\r\nto express them, I do it with the same independence here which I have\r\npracticed everywhere, and which is inseparable from my nature. But enough\r\nof this miserable tergiversator, who ought indeed either to have been of\r\nmore truth, or less trusted by his country.[5]\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of papers, permit me to ask one from you. You\r\nremember the difference of opinion between Hamilton and Knox on the one\r\npart, and myself on the other, on the subject of firing on the little\r\nSarah, and that we had exchanged opinions and reasons in writing. On\r\nyour arrival in Philadelphia I delivered you a copy of my reasons, in\r\nthe presence of Colonel Hamilton. On our withdrawing, he told me he had\r\nbeen so much engaged that he had not been able to prepare a copy of his\r\nand General Knox's for you, and that if I would send you the one he had\r\ngiven me, he would replace it in a few days. I immediately sent it to\r\nyou, wishing you should see both sides of the subject together. I often\r\nafter applied to both the gentlemen but could never obtain another copy.\r\nI have often thought of asking this one, or a copy of it, back from you,\r\nbut have not before written on subjects of this kind to you. Though I\r\ndo not know that it will ever be of the least importance to me, yet one\r\nloves to possess arms, though they hope never to have occasion for them.\r\nThey possess my paper in my own handwriting. It is just I should possess\r\ntheirs. The only thing amiss is, that they should have left me to seek a\r\nreturn of the paper, or a copy of it, from you.\r\n\r\nI put away this disgusting dish of old fragments, and talk to you of my\r\npeas and clover. As to the latter article, I have great encouragement\r\nfrom the friendly nature of our soil. I think I have had, both the last\r\nand present year, as good clover from common grounds, which had brought\r\nseveral crops of wheat and corn without ever having been manured, as I\r\never saw on the lots around Philadelphia. I verily believe that a yield\r\nof thirty-four acres, sowed on wheat April was twelvemonth, has given me\r\na ton to the acre at its first cutting this spring. The stalks extended,\r\nmeasured three and a half feet long very commonly. Another field, a year\r\nolder, and which yielded as well the last year, has sensibly fallen off\r\nthis year. My exhausted fields bring a clover not high enough for hay,\r\nbut I hope to make seed from it. Such as these, however, I shall hereafter\r\nput into peas in the broadcast, proposing that one of my sowings of wheat\r\nshall be after two years of clover, and the other after two years of peas.\r\nI am trying the white boiling pea of Europe (the Albany pea) this year,\r\ntill I can get the hog pea of England, which is the most productive of\r\nall. But the true winter vetch is what we want extremely. I have tried\r\nthis year the Carolina drill. It is absolutely perfect. Nothing can be\r\nmore simple, nor perform its office more perfectly for a single row. I\r\nshall try to make one to sow four rows at a time of wheat or peas, at\r\ntwelve inches distance. I have one of the Scotch threshing machines nearly\r\nfinished. It is copied exactly from a model Mr. Pinckney sent me, only\r\nthat I have put the whole works (except the horse wheel) into a single\r\nframe, movable from one field to another on the two axles of a wagon. It\r\nwill be ready in time for the harvest which is coming on, which will give\r\nit a full trial. Our wheat and rye are generally fine, and the prices\r\ntalked of bid fair to indemnify us for the poor crops of the two last\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of putting under your cover a letter to the son of the\r\nMarquis de la Fayette, not exactly knowing where to direct to him.\r\n\r\nWith very affectionate compliments to Mrs. Washington, I have the honor\r\nto be, with great and sincere esteem and respect, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [5] [Here, in the margin of the copy, is written, apparently at a\r\n        later date, \"General H. Lee.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 19, 1796.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The inquiries of Congress were the first intimation which\r\nreached my retirement of your being in this country, and from M. Volney,\r\nnow with me, I first learned where you are. I avail myself of the earliest\r\nmoments of this information, to express to you the satisfaction with\r\nwhich I learn that you are in a land of safety, where you will meet in\r\nevery person the friend of your worthy father and family. Among these, I\r\nbeg leave to mingle my own assurances of sincere attachment to him, and\r\nmy desire to prove it by every service I can render you. I know, indeed,\r\nthat you are already under too good a patronage to need any other, and\r\nthat my distance and retirement render my affections unavailing to you.\r\nThey exist, nevertheless, in all their purity and warmth towards your\r\nfather and every one embraced by his love; and no one has wished with more\r\nanxiety to see him once more in the bosom of a nation, who, knowing his\r\nworks and his worth, desire to make him and his family forever their own.\r\nYou were, perhaps, too young to remember me personally when in Paris. But\r\nI pray you to remember, that should any occasion offer wherein I can be\r\nuseful to you, there is no one on whose friendship and zeal you may more\r\nconfidently count. You will, some day perhaps, take a tour through these\r\nStates. Should anything in this part of them attract your curiosity, it\r\nwould be a circumstance of great gratification to me to receive you here,\r\nand to assure you in person of those sentiments of esteem and attachment,\r\nwith which I am, Dear Sir, your friend and humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. HITE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, June 29, 1796.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The bearer hereof is the Duke de Liancourt, one of the principal\r\nnoblemen of France, and one of the richest. All this he has lost in the\r\nrevolutions of his country, retaining only his virtue and good sense,\r\nwhich he possesses in a high degree. He was President of the National\r\nAssembly of France in its earliest stage, and forced to fly from the\r\nproscriptions of Marat. Being a stranger, and desirous of acquiring some\r\nknowledge of the country he passes through, he has asked me to introduce\r\nhim to some person in or near Winchester, but I too am a stranger after\r\nso long an absence from my country. Some apology then is necessary for my\r\nundertaking to present this gentleman to you. It is the general interest\r\nof our country that strangers of distinction passing through it, should\r\nbe made acquainted with its best citizens, and those most qualified to\r\ngive favorable impressions of it. He well deserves any attentions you will\r\nbe pleased to show him. He would have had a letter from Mr. Madison to\r\nyou, as he was to have visited Mr. Madison at his own house, being well\r\nacquainted with him, but the uncertainty whether he has returned home,\r\nand his desire to see Staunton, turns him off the road at this place. I\r\nbeg leave to add my acknowledgments to his for any civilities you will be\r\npleased to show him, and to assure you of the sentiments of esteem with\r\nwhich I am, Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JONATHAN WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                  MONTICELLO, July 3, 1796.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I take shame to myself for having so long left unanswered your\r\nvaluable favor on the subject of the mountains. But in truth, I am become\r\nlazy as to everything except agriculture. The preparations for harvest,\r\nand the length of the harvest itself, which is not yet finished, would\r\nhave excused the delay however, at all times and under all dispositions.\r\nI examined, with great satisfaction, your barometrical estimate of\r\nthe heights of our mountains; and with the more, as they corroborated\r\nconjectures on this subject which I had made before. My estimates had made\r\nthem a little higher than yours (I speak of the Blue Ridge). Measuring\r\nwith a very nice instrument the angle subtended vertically by the highest\r\nmountain of the Blue Ridge opposite to my own house, a distance of about\r\neighteen miles south westward, I made the highest about two thousand feet,\r\nas well as I remember, for I can no longer find the notes I made. You\r\nmake the south side of the mountain near Rockfish Gap, one thousand seven\r\nhundred and twenty-two feet above Woods'. You make the other side of the\r\nmountain seven hundred and sixty-seven feet. Mr. Thomas Lewis deceased,\r\nan accurate man, with a good quadrant, made the north side of the highest\r\nmountain opposite my house something more (I think) than one thousand\r\nfeet; but the mountain estimated by him and myself is probably higher than\r\nthat next Rockfish Gap. I do not remember from what principles I estimated\r\nthe Peaks of Otter at four thousand feet; but some late observations\r\nof Judge Tucker's coincided very nearly with my estimate. Your measures\r\nconfirm another opinion of mine, that the Blue Ridge, on its south side,\r\nis the highest ridge in our country compared with its base. I think your\r\nobservations on these mountains well worthy of being published, and hope\r\nyou will not scruple to let them be communicated to the world.\r\n\r\nYou wish me to present to the Philosophical Society the result of my\r\nphilosophical researches since my retirement. But, my good Sir, I have\r\nmade researches into nothing but what is connected with agriculture.\r\nIn this way, I have a little matter to communicate, and will do it\r\nere long. It is the form of a mould-board _of least resistance_. I had\r\nsome years ago conceived the principles of it, and I explained them to\r\nMr. Rittenhouse. I have since reduced the thing to practice, and have\r\nreason to believe the theory fully confirmed. I only wish for one of\r\nthose instruments used in England for measuring the force exerted in the\r\ndraughts of different ploughs, &c., that I might compare the resistance\r\nof my mould-board with that of others. But these instruments are not\r\nto be had here. In a letter of this date to Mr. Rittenhouse, I mention\r\na discovery in animal history, very signal indeed, of which I shall\r\nlay before the Society the best account I can, as soon as I shall have\r\nreceived some other materials collecting for me.\r\n\r\nI have seen, with extreme indignation, the blasphemies lately vended\r\nagainst the memory of the father of American philosophy. But his memory\r\nwill be preserved and venerated as long as the thunder of heaven shall be\r\nheard or feared.\r\n\r\nWith good wishes to all of his family, and sentiments of great respect and\r\nesteem for yourself, I am, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, July 10, 1796.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe campaign of Congress has closed. Though the Anglomen have in the end\r\ngot their treaty through, and so far have triumphed over the cause of\r\nrepublicanism, yet it has been to them a dear-bought victory. It has given\r\nthe most radical shock to their party which it has ever received; and\r\nthere is no doubt, they would be glad to be replaced on the ground they\r\npossessed the instant before Jay's nomination extraordinary. They see that\r\nnothing can support them but the colossus of the President's merits with\r\nthe people, and the moment he retires, that his successor, if a monocrat,\r\nwill be overborne by the republican sense of his constituents; if a\r\nrepublican, he will, of course, give fair play to that sense, and lead\r\nthings into the channel of harmony between the governors and governed. In\r\nthe meantime, patience.\r\n\r\nAmong your neighbors there is nothing new. Mr. Rittenhouse is lately dead.\r\nWe have had the finest harvest ever known in this part of the country.\r\nBoth the quantity and quality of wheat are extraordinary. We got fifteen\r\nshillings a bushel for the last crop, and hope two-thirds of that at least\r\nfor the present one.\r\n\r\nMost assiduous court is paid to Patrick Henry. He has been offered\r\neverything which they knew he would not accept. Some impression is thought\r\nto be made, but we do not believe it is radical. If they thought they\r\ncould count upon him, they would run him for their Vice President; their\r\nfirst object being to produce a schism in this State. As it is, they\r\nwill run Mr. Pinckney; in which they regard his southern position rather\r\nthan his principles. Mr. Jay and his advocate Camillus are completely\r\ntreaty-foundered.\r\n\r\nWe all join in love to Mrs. Monroe; and accept for yourself assurances of\r\nsincere and affectionate friendship. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL J. STUART.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 10, 1796.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your last favor, together\r\nwith the bones of the great claw, which accompanied it. My anxiety to\r\nobtain a thigh bone is such, that I defer communicating what we have\r\nto the Philosophical Society, in the hope of adding that bone to the\r\ncollection. We should then be able to fix the stature of the animal,\r\nwithout going into conjecture and calculation, as we should possess\r\na whole limb, from the haunch bone to the claw inclusive. However, as\r\nyou announce to me that the recovery of a thigh bone is desperate, I\r\nshall make the communication to the Philosophical Society. I think it\r\nhappy that this incident will make known to them a person so worthy as\r\nyourself to be taken into their body, and without whose attention to\r\nthese extraordinary remains, the world might have been deprived of the\r\nknowledge of them. I cannot, however, help believing that this animal, as\r\nwell as the mammoth, are still existing. The annihilation of any species\r\nof existence, is so unexampled in any parts of the economy of nature\r\nwhich we see, that we have a right to conclude, as to the parts we do not\r\nsee, that the probabilities against such annihilation are stronger than\r\nthose for it. In hopes of hearing from you, as soon as you can form a\r\nconclusion satisfactory to yourself, that the thigh bone will or will not\r\nbe recovered, I remain, with great respect and esteem, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 17, 1796.\r\n\r\nYour favor of the 5th came to hand last night. The first wish of my heart\r\nwas, that you should have been proposed for the administration of the\r\ngovernment. On your declining it, I wish any body rather than myself; and\r\nthere is nothing I so anxiously hope, as that my name may come out either\r\nsecond or third. These would be indifferent to me; as the last would\r\nleave me at home the whole year, and the other two-thirds of it. I have\r\nno expectation that the Eastern States will suffer themselves to be so\r\nmuch outwitted, as to be made the tools for bringing in P. instead of A. I\r\npresume they will throw away their second vote. In this case, it begins to\r\nappear possible, that there may be an equal division where I had supposed\r\nthe republican vote would have been considerably minor. It seems also\r\npossible, that the Representatives may be divided. This is a difficulty\r\nfrom which the Constitution has provided no issue. It is both my duty and\r\ninclination, therefore, to relieve the embarrassment, should it happen;\r\nand in that case, I pray you and authorize you fully, to solicit on my\r\nbehalf that Mr. Adams may be preferred. He has always been my senior, from\r\nthe commencement of our public life, and the expression of the public will\r\nbeing equal, this circumstance ought to give him the preference. And when\r\nso many motives will be operating to induce some of the members to change\r\ntheir vote, the addition of my wish may have some effect to preponderate\r\nthe scale. I am really anxious to see the speech. It must exhibit a very\r\ndifferent picture of our foreign affairs from that presented in the adieu,\r\nor it will little correspond with my views of them. I think they never\r\nwore so gloomy an aspect since the year 1783. Let those come to the helm\r\nwho think they can steer clear of the difficulties. I have no confidence\r\nin myself for the undertaking.\r\n\r\nWe have had the severest weather ever known in November. The thermometer\r\nwas at twelve degrees here and in Goochland and I suppose generally.\r\nIt arrested my buildings very suddenly, when eight days more would\r\nhave completed my walls, and permitted us to cover in. The drought is\r\nexcessive. From the middle of October to the middle of December, not rain\r\nenough to lay the dust. A few days ago there fell a small rain but the\r\nsucceeding cold has probably prevented it from sprouting the grain sown\r\nduring the drought.\r\n\r\nPresent me in friendly terms to Messrs. Giles, Venable, and Page. Adieu\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 27, 1796.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--* * * * *\r\n\r\nYou have seen my name lately tacked to so much of eulogy and of abuse,\r\nthat I dare say you hardly thought it meant your old acquaintance of '76.\r\nIn truth, I did not know myself under the pens either of my friends or\r\nfoes. It is unfortunate for our peace, that unmerited abuse wounds, while\r\nunmerited praise has not the power to heal. These are hard wages for the\r\nservices of all the active and healthy years of one's life. I had retired\r\nafter five and twenty years of constant occupation in public affairs, and\r\ntotal abandonment of my own. I retired much poorer than when I entered\r\nthe public service, and desired nothing but rest and oblivion. My name,\r\nhowever, was again brought forward, without concert or expectation on my\r\npart; (on my salvation I declare it.) I do not as yet know the result,\r\nas a matter of fact; for in my retired canton we have nothing later from\r\nPhiladelphia than of the second week of this month. Yet I have never one\r\nmoment doubted the result. I knew it was impossible Mr. Adams should\r\nlose a vote north of the Delaware, and that the free and moral agency\r\nof the South would furnish him an abundant supplement. On principles of\r\npublic respect I should not have refused; but I protest before my God,\r\nthat I shall, from the bottom of my heart, rejoice at escaping. I know\r\nwell that no man will ever bring out of that office the reputation which\r\ncarries him into it. The honey moon would be as short in that case as\r\nin any other, and its moments of ecstasy would be ransomed by years of\r\ntorment and hatred. I shall highly value, indeed, the share which I may\r\nhave had in the late vote, as an evidence of the share I hold in the\r\nesteem of my countrymen. But in this point of view, a few votes more\r\nor less will be little sensible, and in every other, the minor will be\r\npreferred by me to the major vote. I have no ambition to govern men; no\r\npassion which would lead me to delight to ride in a storm. _Flumina amo,\r\nsylvasque, inglorius._ My attachment to my home has enabled me to make\r\nthe calculation with rigor, perhaps with partiality, to the issue which\r\nkeeps me there. The newspapers will permit me to plant my corn, peas, &c.,\r\nin hills or drills as I please (and my oranges, by-the-bye, when you send\r\nthem), while our eastern friend will be struggling with the storm which is\r\ngathering over us; perhaps be shipwrecked in it. This is certainly not a\r\nmoment to covet the helm.\r\n\r\nI have often doubted whether most to praise or to blame your line of\r\nconduct. If you had lent to your country the excellent talents you\r\npossess, on you would have fallen those torrents of abuse which have\r\nlately been poured forth on me. So far, I praise the wisdom which has\r\ndescried and steered clear of a water-spout ahead. But now for the blame.\r\nThere is a debt of service due from every man to his country, proportioned\r\nto the bounties which nature and fortune have measured to him. Counters\r\nwill pay this from the poor of spirit; but from you, my friend, coin was\r\ndue. There is no bankrupt law in heaven, by which you may get off with\r\nshillings in the pound; with rendering to a single State what you owed\r\nto the whole confederacy. I think it was by the Roman law that a father\r\nwas denied sepulture, unless his son would pay his debts. Happy for you\r\nand us, that you have a son whom genius and education have qualified to\r\npay yours. But as you have been a good father in everything else, be so\r\nin this also. Come forward and pay your own debts. Your friends, the Mr.\r\nPinckneys, have at length undertaken their tour. My joy at this would be\r\ncomplete if you were in gear with them. I love to see honest and honorable\r\nmen at the helm, men who will not bend their politics to their purses,\r\nnor pursue measures by which they may profit, and then profit by their\r\nmeasures. _Au diable les Bougres!_ I am at the end of my curse and bottom\r\nof my page, so God bless you and yours. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Statement from memory, of a letter I wrote to John Adams; copy omitted to\r\nbe retained._\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, December 28, 1796.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The public, and the public papers, have been much occupied\r\nlately in placing us in a point of opposition to each other. I confidently\r\ntrust we have felt less of it ourselves. In the retired canton where\r\nI live, we know little of what is passing. Our last information from\r\nPhiladelphia is of the 16th instant. At that date the issue of the late\r\nelection seems not to have been known as a matter of fact. With me,\r\nhowever, its issue was never doubted. I knew the impossibility of your\r\nlosing a single vote north of the Delaware; and even if you should lose\r\nthat of Pennsylvania in the mass, you would get enough south of it to make\r\nyour election sure. I never for a single moment expected any other issue;\r\nand though I shall not be believed, yet it is not the less true, that I\r\nnever wished any other. My neighbors, as my compurgators, could aver this\r\nfact, as seeing my occupations and my attachment to them. It is possible,\r\nindeed, that even you may be cheated of your succession by a trick worthy\r\nthe subtlety of your arch friend of New York, who has been able to make\r\nof your real friends tools for defeating their and your just wishes.\r\nProbably, however, he will be disappointed as to you; and my inclinations\r\nput me out of his reach. I leave to others the sublime delights of riding\r\nin the storm, better pleased with sound sleep and a warmer berth below it,\r\nencircled with the society of my neighbors, friends, and fellow laborers\r\nof the earth, rather than with spies and sycophants. Still, I shall value\r\nhighly the share I may have had in the late vote, as a measure of the\r\nshare I hold in the esteem of my fellow citizens. In this point of view, a\r\nfew votes less are but little sensible, while a few more would have been\r\nin their effect very sensible and oppressive to me. I have no ambition\r\nto govern men. It is a painful and thankless office. And never since the\r\nday you signed the treaty of Paris, has our horizon been so overcast.\r\nI devoutly wish you may be able to shun for us this war, which will\r\ndestroy our agriculture, commerce, and credit. If you do, the glory will\r\nbe all your own. And that your administration may be filled with glory\r\nand happiness to yourself, and advantage to us, is the sincere prayer of\r\none, who, though in the course of our voyage, various little incidents\r\nhave happened or been contrived to separate us, yet retains for you the\r\nsolid esteem of the times when we were working for our independence, and\r\nsentiments of sincere respect and attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Statement from memory, of a letter I wrote to James Madison; copy omitted\r\nto be retained._\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 1, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of December the 19th is safely received. I never\r\nentertained a doubt of the event of the election. I knew that the eastern\r\ntroops were trained in the schools of their town meetings to sacrifice\r\nlittle differences of opinion to the solid advantages of operating in\r\nphalanx, and that the more free and moral agency of the other States would\r\nfully supply their deficiency. I had no expectation, indeed, that the\r\nvote would have approached so near an equality. It is difficult to obtain\r\nfull credit to declarations of disinclination to honors, and most so with\r\nthose who still remain in the world. But never was there a more solid\r\nunwillingness, founded on rigorous calculation, formed in the mind of any\r\nman, short of peremptory refusal. No arguments, therefore, were necessary\r\nto reconcile me to a relinquishment of the first office, or acceptance of\r\nthe second. No motive could have induced me to undertake the first, but\r\nthat of putting our vessel upon her republican tack, and preventing her\r\nbeing driven too far to leeward of her true principles. And the second is\r\nthe only office in the world about which I cannot decide in my own mind,\r\nwhether I had rather have it or not have it. Pride does not enter into the\r\nestimate. For I think with the Romans of old, that the General of to-day\r\nshould be a common soldier to-morrow, if necessary. But as to Mr. Adams,\r\nparticularly, I could have no feelings which would revolt at being placed\r\nin a secondary station to him. I am his junior in life, I was his junior\r\nin Congress, his junior in the diplomatic line, and lately his junior in\r\nour civil government. I had written him the enclosed letter before the\r\nreceipt of yours. I had intended it for some time, but had put it off,\r\nfrom time to time, from the discouragement of despair to make him believe\r\nme sincere. As the information by the last post does not make it necessary\r\nto change anything in the letter, I enclose it open for your perusal, as\r\nwell that you may be possessed of the true state of dispositions between\r\nus, as that if there be any circumstance which might render its delivery\r\nineligible, you may return it to me. If Mr. Adams could be induced to\r\nadminister the government on its true principles, quitting his bias for\r\nan English constitution, it would be worthy consideration whether it\r\nwould not for the public good, to come to a good understanding with him\r\nas to his future elections. He is the only sure barrier against Hamilton's\r\ngetting in.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Political Progress is a work of value and of a singular complexion.\r\nThe author's eye seems to be a natural achromatic, divesting every object\r\nof the glare of color. The former work of the same title possessed the\r\nsame kind of merit. They disgust one, indeed, by opening to his view\r\nthe ulcerated state of the human mind. But to cure an ulcer you must go\r\nto the bottom of it, which no author does more radically than this. The\r\nreflections into which it leads us are not very flattering to the human\r\nspecies. In the whole animal kingdom I recollect no family but man,\r\nsteadily and systematically employed in the destruction of itself. Nor\r\ndoes what is called civilization produce any other effect, than to teach\r\nhim to pursue the principle of the _bellum omnium in omnia_ on a greater\r\nscale, and instead of the little contest between tribe and tribe, to\r\ncomprehend all the quarters of the earth in the same work of destruction.\r\nIf to this we add, that as to other animals, the lions and tigers are mere\r\nlambs compared with man as a destroyer, we must conclude that nature has\r\nbeen able to find in man alone a sufficient barrier against the too great\r\nmultiplication of other animals and of man himself, an equilibrating power\r\nagainst the fecundity of generation. While in making these observations,\r\nmy situation points my attention to the warfare of man in the physical\r\nworld, yours may perhaps present him as equally warring in the moral one.\r\nAdieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VOLNEY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, January 8, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received yesterday your two favors of December the 26th and\r\n29th. Your impatience to receive your valise and its key was natural; and\r\nit is we who have been to blame; Mr. Randolph, for not taking information\r\nof the vessel and address to which your valise was committed, and myself\r\nfor having waited till I heard of your being again immerged into the land\r\nof newspapers before I forwarded your key. However, as you have at length\r\ngot them safe, I claim absolution under the proverb, that \"all is well\r\nwhich ends well.\"\r\n\r\nAbout the end of 1793, I received from Mr. Dombey (then at Lyons) a letter\r\nannouncing his intention to come here. And in May, 1794, I received one\r\nfrom a M. L'Epine, dated from New York, and stating himself to be master\r\nof the brig de Boon, Captain Brown, which had sailed from Havre with Mr.\r\nDombey on board, who had sealed up his baggage and wrote my address on\r\nthem, to save them in case of capture; and that when they were taken,\r\nthe address did in fact protect them. He mentioned then the death of Mr.\r\nDombey, and that he had delivered his baggage to the Custom House at New\r\nYork. I immediately wrote to M. L'Epine, disclaiming any right or interest\r\nin the packages under my address, and authorizing, as far as depended\r\non me, the consul at New York, or any person the representative of Mr.\r\nDombey, to open the packages and dispose of them according to right. I\r\nenclosed this letter open to Mr. Randolph, then Secretary of State, to get\r\nhis interference for the liberation of the effects. It may have happened\r\nthat he failed to forward the letter, or that M. L'Epine may have gone\r\nbefore it reached New York. In any event, I can do no more than repeat my\r\ndisclaimer of any right to Mr. Dombey's effects, and add all the authority\r\nwhich I can give to yourself, or the consul of France at New York, to do\r\nwith those effects whatever I might do. Certainly, it would be a great\r\ngratification to me to receive the Metre and Grave committed to Mr.\r\nDombey for me, and that you would be so good as to be the channel of my\r\nacknowledgments to Bishop Gregoire, or any one else to whom I should owe\r\nthis favor.\r\n\r\nYou wish to know the state of the air here during the late cold spell,\r\nor rather the present one, for it is at this moment so cold that the ink\r\nfreezes in my pen, so that my letter will scarcely be legible.\r\n\r\nThe following is copied from my diary.\r\n\r\n          Sun rise.       3 P.

In 1783-84, I was at\r\nAnnapolis without a thermometer, and I do not know that there was one\r\nin that State; I heard from Virginia, that the mercury was again down\r\nto six degrees. In 1789-90, I was at Paris. The mercury here was as low\r\nas eighteen degrees below zero, of Fahrenheit. These have been the most\r\nremarkably cold winters ever known in America. We are told, however,\r\nthat in 1762, at Philadelphia, it was twenty-two degrees below zero; in\r\nDecember, 1793, it was three degrees below zero there by my thermometer.\r\nOn the 31st of January, 1796, it was one and three-fourth degrees above\r\nzero at Monticello. I shall therefore have to change the maximum of our\r\ncold, if ever I revise the Notes on Virginia; as six degrees above zero\r\nwas the greatest which had ever been observed.\r\n\r\nIt seems possible, from what we hear of the votes at the late election,\r\nthat you may see me in Philadelphia about the beginning of March, exactly\r\nin that character which, if I were to reappear at Philadelphia, I would\r\nprefer to all others; for I change the sentiment of Clorinda to \"L'Alte\r\ntemo, l'humile non sdegno.\" I have no inclination to govern men. I should\r\nhave no views of my own in doing it; and as to those of the governed, I\r\nhad rather that their disappointment (which must always happen) should\r\nbe pointed to any other cause, real or supposed, than to myself. I value\r\nthe late vote highly; but it is only as the index of the place I hold in\r\nthe esteem of my fellow citizens. In this point of view, the difference\r\nbetween sixty-eight and seventy-one votes is little sensible, and still\r\nless that between the real vote, which was sixty-nine and seventy;\r\nbecause one real elector in Pennsylvania was excluded from voting by the\r\nmiscarriage of the votes, and one who was not an elector was admitted\r\nto vote. My farm, my family, my books and my building, give me much more\r\npleasure than any public office would, and, especially, one which would\r\nkeep me constantly from them. I had hoped, when you were here, to have\r\nfinished the walls of my house in the autumn, and to have covered it early\r\nin winter. But we did not finish them at all. I have to resume the work,\r\ntherefore, in the spring, and to take off the roof of the old part during\r\nthe summer, to cover the whole. This will render it necessary for me to\r\nmake a very short stay in Philadelphia, should the late vote have given me\r\nany public duty there. My visit there will be merely out of respect to the\r\npublic, and to the new President.\r\n\r\nI am sorry you have received so little information on the subject of\r\nour winds. I had once (before our revolution war) a project on the same\r\nsubject. As I had then an extensive acquaintance over this State, I meant\r\nto have engaged some person in every county of it, giving them each a\r\nthermometer, to observe that and the winds twice a day, for one year, to\r\nwit, at sun-rise and at four P. M., (the coldest and the warmest point of\r\nthe twenty-four hours,) and to communicate their observations to me at the\r\nend of the year. I should then have selected the days in which it appeared\r\nthat the winds blew to a centre within the State, and have made a map of\r\nthem, and seen how far they had analogy with the temperature of the air. I\r\nmeant this to be merely a specimen to be communicated to the Philosophical\r\nSociety at Philadelphia, in order to engage them, by means of their\r\ncorrespondents, to have the same thing done in every State, and through\r\na series of years. By seizing the days when the winds centred in any part\r\nof the United States, we might, in time, have come to some of the causes\r\nwhich determine the direction of the winds, which I suspect to be very\r\nvarious. But this long-winded project was prevented by the war which came\r\nupon us, and since that I have been far otherwise engaged. I am sure you\r\nwill have viewed the subject from much higher ground, and I shall be happy\r\nto learn your views in some of the hours of _délassement_, which I hope we\r\nare yet to pass together. To this must be added your observations on the\r\nnew character of man, which you have seen in your journey, as he is in all\r\nhis shapes a curious animal, on whom no one is better qualified to judge\r\nthan yourself; and no one will be more pleased to participate of your\r\nviews of him than one, who has the pleasure of offering you his sentiments\r\nof sincere respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY TAZEWELL.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 16, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As far as the public papers are to be credited, I may suppose\r\nthat the choice of Vice President has fallen on me. On this hypothesis\r\nI trouble you, and only pray, if it be wrong, that you will consider\r\nthis letter as not written. I believe it belongs to the Senate to notify\r\nthe Vice President of his election. I recollect to have heard, that\r\non the first election of President and Vice President, gentlemen of\r\nconsiderable office were sent to notify the parties chosen. But this\r\nwas the inauguration of our new government, and ought not to be drawn\r\ninto example. At the second election, both gentlemen were on the spot\r\nand needed no messengers. On the present occasion, the President will\r\nbe on the spot, so that what is now to be done respects myself alone;\r\nand considering that the season of notification will always present one\r\ndifficulty, that the distance in the present case adds a second, not\r\ninconsiderable, and which may in future happen to be sometimes much more\r\nconsiderable, I hope the Senate will adopt that method of notification,\r\nwhich will always be least troublesome and most certain. The channel of\r\nthe post is certainly the least troublesome, is the most rapid, and,\r\nconsidering also that it may be sent by duplicates and triplicates,\r\nis unquestionably the most certain. Indorsed to the postmaster at\r\nCharlottesville, with an order to send it by express, no hazard can\r\nendanger the notification. Apprehending, that should there be a difference\r\nof opinion on this subject in the Senate, my ideas of self-respect might\r\nbe supposed by some to require something more formal and inconvenient, I\r\nbeg leave to avail myself of your friendship to declare, if a different\r\nproposition should make it necessary, that I consider the channel of the\r\npost-office as the most eligible in every respect, and that it is to me\r\nthe most desirable; which I take the liberty of expressing, not with a\r\nview of encroaching on the respect due to that discretion which the Senate\r\nhave a right to exercise on the occasion, but to render them the more free\r\nin the exercise of it, by taking off whatsoever weight the supposition of\r\na contrary desire in me might have on the mind of any member.\r\n\r\nI am, with sincere respect, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 22, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 8th came to hand yesterday. I was not aware of any\r\nnecessity of going on to Philadelphia immediately, yet I had determined\r\nto do it, as a mark of respect to the public, and to do away the doubts\r\nwhich have spread, that I should consider the second office as beneath\r\nmy acceptance. The journey, indeed, for the month of February, is a\r\ntremendous undertaking for me, who have not been seven miles from home\r\nsince my re-settlement. I will see you about the rising of Congress; and\r\npresume I need not stay there a week. Your letters written before the 7th\r\nof February will still find me here. My letters inform me that Mr. Adams\r\nspeaks of me with great friendship, and with satisfaction in the prospect\r\nof administering the government in concurrence with me. I am glad of the\r\nfirst information, because though I saw that our ancient friendship was\r\naffected by a little leaven, produced partly by his constitution, partly\r\nby the contrivance of others, yet I never felt a diminution of confidence\r\nin his integrity, and retained a solid affection for him. His principles\r\nof government I knew to be changed, but conscientiously changed. As to my\r\nparticipating in the administration, if by that he meant the executive\r\ncabinet, both duty and inclination will shut that door to me. I cannot\r\nhave a wish to see the scenes of 1793 revived as to myself, and to descend\r\ndaily into the arena like a gladiator, to suffer martyrdom in every\r\nconflict. As to duty, the Constitution will know me only as the member\r\nof a legislative body; and its principle is, that of a separation of\r\nlegislative, executive and judiciary functions, except in cases specified.\r\nIf this principle be not expressed in direct terms, yet it is clearly the\r\nspirit of the Constitution, and it ought to be so commented and acted on\r\nby every friend to free government.\r\n\r\nI sincerely deplore the situation of our affairs with France. War with\r\nthem, and consequent alliance with Great Britain, will completely compass\r\nthe object of the executive council, from the commencement of the war\r\nbetween France and England; taken up by some of them from that moment,\r\nby others, more latterly. I still, however, hope it will be avoided. I\r\ndo not believe Mr. Adams wishes war with France; nor do I believe he will\r\ntruckle to England as servilely as has been done. If he assumes this front\r\nat once, and shows that he means to attend to self-respect and national\r\ndignity with both the nations, perhaps the depredations of both on our\r\ncommerce may be amicably arrested. I think we should begin first with\r\nthose who first began with us, and, by an example on them, acquire a right\r\nto re-demand the respect from which the other party has departed.\r\n\r\nI suppose you are informed of the proceeding commenced by the legislature\r\nof Maryland, to claim the south branch of the Potomac as their boundary,\r\nand thus of Albemarle, now the central county of the State, to make a\r\nfrontier. As it is impossible, upon any consistent principles, and after\r\nsuch a length of undisturbed possession, that they can expect to establish\r\ntheir claim, it can be ascribed to no other than an intention to irritate\r\nand divide; and there can be no doubt from what bow the shaft is shot.\r\nHowever, let us cultivate Pennsylvania, and we need not fear the universe.\r\nThe Assembly have named me among those who are to manage this controversy.\r\nBut I am so averse to motion and contest, and the other members are so\r\nfully equal to the business, that I cannot undertake to act in it. I\r\nwish you were added to them. Indeed, I wish and hope you may consent to\r\nbe added to our Assembly itself. There is no post where you can render\r\ngreater services, without going out of your State. Let but this block\r\nstand firm on its basis, and Pennsylvania do the same, our Union will be\r\nperpetual, and our General Government kept within the bounds and form of\r\nthe Constitution. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO G. WYTHE.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 22, 1797.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that I will be called on to preside in a legislative\r\nchamber. It is now so long since I have acted in the legislative line,\r\nthat I am entirely rusty in the Parliamentary rules of procedure. I know\r\nthey have been more studied and are better known by you than by any man\r\nin America, perhaps by any man living. I am in hopes that while inquiring\r\ninto the subject you made notes on it. If any such remain in your hands,\r\nhowever informal, in books or in scraps of paper, and you will be so good\r\nas to trust me with them a little while, they shall be most faithfully\r\nreturned. If they lie in small compass they might come by post, without\r\nregard to expense. If voluminous, Mr. Randolph will be passing through\r\nRichmond on his way from Varina to this place about the 10th of February,\r\nand could give them a safe conveyance. Did the Assembly do anything for\r\nthe preservation by publication of the laws? With great affection, adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN LANGDON.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 22, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your friendly letter of the 2d instant, never came to hand\r\ntill yesterday, and I feel myself indebted for the solicitude you therein\r\nexpress for my undertaking the office to which you inform me I am called.\r\nI know not from what source an idea has spread itself, which I have found\r\nto be generally spread, that I would accept the office of President of\r\nthe United States, but not of Vice President. When I retired from the\r\noffice I last held, no man in the Union less expected than I did, ever\r\nto have come forward again; and, whatever has been insinuated to the\r\ncontrary, to no man in the Union was the share which my name bore in the\r\nlate contest, more unexpected than it was to me. If I had contemplated\r\nthe thing beforehand, and suffered my will to enter into action at all on\r\nit, it would have been in a direction exactly the reverse of what has been\r\nimputed to me; but I had no right to a will on the subject, much less to\r\ncontrol that of the people of the United States in arranging us according\r\nto our capacities. Least of all could I have any feelings which would\r\nrevolt at taking a station secondary to Mr. Adams. I have been secondary\r\nto him in every situation in which we ever acted together in public life\r\nfor twenty years past. A contrary position would have been the novelty,\r\nand his the right of revolting at it. Be assured then, my dear Sir, that\r\nif I had had a fibre in my composition still looking after public office,\r\nit would have been gratified precisely by the very call you are pleased to\r\nannounce to me, and no other. But in truth I wish for neither honors nor\r\noffices. I am happier at home than I can be elsewhere. Since, however, I\r\nam called out, an object of great anxiety to me is that those with whom\r\nI am to act, shutting their minds to the unfounded abuse of which I have\r\nbeen the subject, will view me with the same candor with which I shall\r\ncertainly act. An acquaintance of many long years ensures to me your\r\njust support, as it does to you the sentiments of sincere respect and\r\nattachment with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR JOHN EDWARDS.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 22, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I was yesterday gratified with the receipt of your favor of\r\nDecember 15th, which gave me the first information of your return from\r\nEurope. On the 20th of October I received a letter of July 30th from\r\nColonel Monroe, but did not know through what channel it came. I should be\r\nglad to see the defence of his conduct which you possess, though no paper\r\nof that title is necessary for me. He was appointed to an office during\r\npleasure merely to get him out of the Senate, and with an intention to\r\nseize the first pretext for exercising the pleasure of recalling him. As\r\nI shall be at Philadelphia the first week in March, perhaps I may have an\r\nopportunity of seeing the paper there in Mr. Madison's hands. I think with\r\nyou it will be best to publish nothing concerning Colonel Monroe till his\r\nreturn, that he may accommodate the complexion of his publication to times\r\nand circumstances. When you left America you had not a good opinion of the\r\ntrain of our affairs. I dare say you do not find that they have got into\r\nbetter train. It will never be easy to convince me that by a firm yet just\r\nconduct in 1793, we might not have obtained such a respect for our neutral\r\nrights from Great Britain, as that her violations of them and use of our\r\nmeans to all her wars, would not have furnished any pretence to the other\r\nparty to do the same. War with both would have been avoided, commerce and\r\nnavigation protected and enlarged. We shall now either be forced into a\r\nwar, or have our commerce and navigation at least totally annihilated, and\r\nthe produce of our farms for some years left to rot on our hands. A little\r\ntime will unfold these things, and show which class of opinions would have\r\nbeen most friendly to the firmness of our government, and to the interests\r\nof those for whom it was made. I am, with great respect, dear Sir, your\r\nmost obedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 22, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received yesterday your kind favor of the 4th instant, and\r\nthe eulogium it covered on the subject of our late invaluable friend\r\nRittenhouse, and I perused it with the avidity and approbation which the\r\nmatter and manner of everything from your pen has long taught me to feel.\r\nI thank you too for your congratulations on the public call on me to\r\nundertake the second office in the United States, but still more for the\r\njustice you do me in viewing as I do the _escape_ from the first. I have\r\nno wish to meddle again in public affairs, being happier at home than I\r\ncan be anywhere else. Still less do I wish to engage in an office where it\r\nwould be impossible to satisfy either friends or foes, and least of all\r\nat a moment when the storm is about to burst, which has been conjuring\r\nup for four years past. If I am to act however, a more tranquil and\r\nunoffending station could not have been found for me, nor one so analogous\r\nto the dispositions of my mind. It will give me philosophical evenings in\r\nthe winter, and rural days in summer. I am indebted to the Philosophical\r\nSociety a communication of some bones of an animal of the lion kind, but\r\nof most exaggerated size. What are we to think of a creature whose claws\r\nwere eight inches long, when those of the lion are not 1½ inches; whose\r\nthigh-bone was 6¼ diameter; when that of the lion is not 1½ inches? Were\r\nnot the things within the jurisdiction of the rule and compass, and of\r\nocular inspection, credit to them could not be obtained. I have been\r\ndisappointed in getting the femur as yet, but shall bring on the bones\r\nI have, if I can, for the Society, and have the pleasure of seeing you\r\nfor a few days in the first week of March. I wish the usual delays of the\r\npublications of the Society may admit the addition to our new volume, of\r\nthis interesting article, which it would be best to have first announced\r\nunder the sanction of their authority. I am, with sincere esteem, dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, January 30, 1797.\r\n\r\nYours of the 18th came to hand yesterday. I am very thankful for the\r\ndiscretion you have exercised over the letter. That has happened to\r\nbe the case, which I knew to be possible, that the honest expression\r\nof my feelings towards Mr. Adams might be rendered _mal-apropos_ from\r\ncircumstances existing, and known at the seat of government, but not known\r\nby me in my retired situation. Mr. Adams and myself were cordial friends\r\nfrom the beginning of the revolution. Since our return from Europe,\r\nsome little incidents have happened, which were capable of affecting a\r\njealous mind like his. His deviation from that line of politics on which\r\nwe had been united, has not made me less sensible of the rectitude of his\r\nheart; and I wished him to know this, and also another truth, that I am\r\nsincerely pleased at having escaped the late draught for the helm, and\r\nhave not a wish which he stands in the way of. That he should be convinced\r\nof these truths, is important to our mutual satisfaction, and perhaps to\r\nthe harmony and good of the public service. But there was a difficulty\r\nin conveying them to him, and a possibility that the attempt might do\r\nmischief there or somewhere else; and I would not have hazarded the\r\nattempt, if you had not been in place to decide upon its expediency. It\r\nhas now become unnecessary to repeat it by a letter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI have turned to the Constitution and laws, and find nothing to warrant\r\nthe opinion that I might not have been qualified here, or wherever else\r\nI could meet with a Senator; any member of that body being authorized\r\nto administer the oath, without being confined to time or place, and\r\nconsequently to make a record of it, and to deposit it with the records\r\nof the Senate. However, I shall come on, on the principle which had first\r\ndetermined me,--respect to the public. I hope I shall be made a part of no\r\nceremony whatever. I shall escape into the city as covertly as possible.\r\nIf Governor Mifflin should show any symptoms of ceremony, pray contrive to\r\nparry them. We have now fine mild weather here. The thermometer is above\r\nthe point which renders fires necessary. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, February 9, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have many acknowledgments to make for the friendly anxiety\r\nyou are pleased to express in your letter of January the 12th, for my\r\nundertaking the office to which I have been elected. The idea that I would\r\naccept the office of President, but not that of Vice President of the\r\nUnited States, had not its origin with me. I never thought of questioning\r\nthe free exercise of the right of my fellow citizens, to marshal those\r\nwhom they call into their service according to their fitness, nor ever\r\npresumed that they were not the best judges of that. Had I indulged a\r\nwish in what manner they should dispose of me, it would precisely have\r\ncoincided with what they have done. Neither the splendor, nor the power,\r\nnor the difficulties, nor the fame or defamation, as may happen, attached\r\nto the first magistracy, have any attractions for me. The helm of a free\r\ngovernment is always arduous, and never was ours more so, than at a moment\r\nwhen two friendly people are like to be committed in war by the ill temper\r\nof their administrations. I am so much attached to my domestic situation,\r\nthat I would not have wished to leave it at all. However, if I am to\r\nbe called from it, the shortest absences and most tranquil station suit\r\nme best. I value highly, indeed, the part my fellow citizens gave me in\r\ntheir late vote, as an evidence of their esteem, and I am happy in the\r\ninformation you are so kind as to give, that many in the eastern quarter\r\nentertain the same sentiment.\r\n\r\nWhere a constitution, like ours, wears a mixed aspect of monarchy and\r\nrepublicanism, its citizens will naturally divide into two classes\r\nof sentiment, according as their tone of body or mind, their habits,\r\nconnections and callings, induce them to wish to strengthen either the\r\nmonarchial or the republican features of the Constitution. Some will\r\nconsider it as an elective monarchy, which had better be made hereditary,\r\nand therefore endeavor to lead towards that all the forms and principles\r\nof its administration. Others will view it as an energetic republic,\r\nturning in all its points on the pivot of free and frequent elections. The\r\ngreat body of our native citizens are unquestionably of the republican\r\nsentiment. Foreign education, and foreign connections of interest, have\r\nproduced some exceptions in every part of the Union, north and south,\r\nand perhaps other circumstances in your quarter, better known to you,\r\nmay have thrown into the scale of exceptions a greater number of the\r\nrich. Still there, I believe, and here, I am sure, the great mass is\r\nrepublican. Nor do any of the forms in which the public disposition has\r\nbeen pronounced in the last half dozen years, evince the contrary. All of\r\nthem, when traced to their true source, have only been evidences of the\r\npreponderant popularity of a particular great character. That influence\r\nonce withdrawn, and our countrymen left to the operation of their own\r\nunbiassed good sense, I have no doubt we shall see a pretty rapid return\r\nof general harmony, and our citizens moving in phalanx in the paths of\r\nregular liberty, order, and a sacrosanct adherence to the constitution.\r\nThus I think it will be, if war with France can be avoided. But if that\r\nuntoward event comes athwart us in our present point of deviation, nobody,\r\nI believe, can foresee into what port it will drive us.\r\n\r\nI am always glad of an opportunity of inquiring after my most ancient\r\nand respected friend Mr. Samuel Adams. His principles, founded on the\r\nimmovable basis of equal right and reason, have continued pure and\r\nunchanged. Permit me to place here my sincere veneration for him, and\r\nwishes for his health and happiness; and to assure yourself of the\r\nsentiments of esteem and respect with which I am, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PEREGRINE FITZHUGH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, April 9, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of March 25th came safely to hand with the ---- of\r\n---- covered, for which accept my thanks. A nephew of mine, Mr. S., who\r\nmarried a daughter of Mr. Carr, near Georgetown, setting out this day for\r\nthat place, I have sent him some of the peas you desired, which he will\r\nenclose under cover to you, and lodge in the care of Mr. Thompson Mason.\r\nThis letter goes separately by post, to notify you that you may call for\r\nthem in time for the present season. I wish it were in my power to satisfy\r\nyou with respect to the sentiments expressed by my friend Mr. Madison in\r\nthe general Convention. But the papers in my possession are under a seal\r\nwhich I have not broken yet, and wish not to break, till I have time to\r\ngive them a thorough perusal and consideration. Two things may be safely\r\nsaid; 1st. When a man whose life has been marked by its candor, has given\r\na latter opinion contrary to a former one, it is probably the result of\r\nfurther inquiry, reflection and conviction. This is a sound answer, if\r\nthe contrariety of sentiment as to the treaty-making power were really\r\nexpressed by him on the former and latter occasion, as was alleged to you.\r\nBut, 2d. As no man weighs more maturely than Mr. Madison before he takes\r\na side on any question, I do not expect he has changed either his opinion\r\non that subject, or the expressions of it, and therefore I presume the\r\nallegation founded in some misconception or misinformation. I have just\r\nreceived a summons to _Congress_ for the 15th of next month. I am sorry\r\nfor it, as everything pacific could have been done without _Congress_,\r\nand I hope nothing is contemplated which is not pacific. I wish I may be\r\nas fortunate in my travelling companions as I was the last trip. I hope\r\nyou found your father and family well; present him, if you please, the\r\nrespectful homage of one who knew him when too young probably to have been\r\nknown by him, and accept yourself assurances of the great esteem of, Dear\r\nSir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, May 13, 1797.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Friend,--Your favor of the 4th instant came to hand yesterday.\r\nThat of the 4th of April, with the one for Monroe, has never been\r\nreceived. The first, of March 27th, did not reach me till April the\r\n21st, when I was within a few days of setting out for this place, and\r\nI put off acknowledging it till I should come here. I entirely commend\r\nyour dispositions towards Mr. Adams; knowing his worth as intimately and\r\nesteeming it as much as any one, and acknowledging the preference of his\r\nclaims, if any I could have had, to the high office conferred on him. But\r\nin truth, I had neither claims nor wishes on the subject, though I know it\r\nwill be difficult to obtain belief of this. When I retired from this place\r\nand the office of Secretary of State, it was in the firmest contemplation\r\nof never more returning here. There had indeed been suggestions in the\r\npublic papers, that I was looking towards a succession to the President's\r\nchair, but feeling a consciousness of their falsehood, and observing that\r\nthe suggestions came from hostile quarters, I considered them as intended\r\nmerely to excite public odium against me. I never in my life exchanged a\r\nword with any person on the subject, till I found my name brought forward\r\ngenerally, in competition with that of Mr. Adams. Those with whom I then\r\ncommunicated, could say, if it were necessary, whether I met the call with\r\ndesire, or even with a ready acquiescence, and whether from the moment\r\nof my first acquiescence, I did not devoutly pray that the very thing\r\nmight happen which has happened. The second office of the government is\r\nhonorable and easy, the first is but a splendid misery.\r\n\r\nYou express apprehensions that stratagems will be used, to produce a\r\nmisunderstanding between the President and myself. Though not a word\r\nhaving this tendency has ever been hazarded to me by any one, yet I\r\nconsider as a certainty that nothing will be left untried to alienate him\r\nfrom me. These machinations will proceed from the Hamiltonians by whom he\r\nis surrounded, and who are only a little less hostile to him than to me.\r\nIt cannot but damp the pleasure of cordiality, when we suspect that it is\r\nsuspected. I cannot help thinking, that it is impossible for Mr. Adams\r\nto believe that the state of my mind is what it really is; that he may\r\nthink I view him as an obstacle in my way. I have no supernatural power\r\nto impress truth on the mind of another, nor he any to discover that the\r\nestimate which he may form, on a just view of the human mind as generally\r\nconstituted, may not be just in its application to a special constitution.\r\nThis may be a source of private uneasiness to us; I honestly confess\r\nthat it is so to me at this time. But neither of us is capable of letting\r\nit have effect on our public duties. Those who may endeavor to separate\r\nus, are probably excited by the fear that I might have influence on the\r\nexecutive councils; but when they shall know that I consider my office as\r\nconstitutionally confined to legislative functions, and that I could not\r\ntake any part whatever in executive consultations, even were it proposed,\r\ntheir fears may perhaps subside, and their object be found not worth a\r\nmachination.\r\n\r\nI do sincerely wish with you, that we could take our stand on a ground\r\nperfectly neutral and independent towards all nations. It has been my\r\nconstant object through my public life; and with respect to the English\r\nand French, particularly, I have too often expressed to the former my\r\nwishes, and made to them propositions verbally and in writing, officially\r\nand privately, to official and private characters, for them to doubt of\r\nmy views, if they would be content with equality. Of this they are in\r\npossession of several written and formal proofs, in my own hand writing.\r\nBut they have wished a monopoly of commerce and influence with us; and\r\nthey have in fact obtained it. When we take notice that theirs is the\r\nworkshop to which we go for all we want; that with them centre either\r\nimmediately or ultimately all the labors of our hands and lands; that to\r\nthem belongs either openly or secretly the great mass of our navigation;\r\nthat even the factorage of their affairs here, is kept to themselves\r\nby factitious citizenships; that these foreign and false citizens now\r\nconstitute the great body of what are called our merchants, fill our sea\r\nports, are planted in every little town and district of the interior\r\ncountry, sway everything in the former places by their own votes, and\r\nthose of their dependants, in the latter, by their insinuations and the\r\ninfluence of their ledgers; that they are advancing fast to a monopoly\r\nof our banks and public funds, and thereby placing our public finances\r\nunder their control; that they have in their alliance the most influential\r\ncharacters in and out of office; when they have shown that by all these\r\nbearings on the different branches of the government, they can force it\r\nto proceed in whatever direction they dictate, and bend the interests\r\nof this country entirely to the will of another; when all this, I say,\r\nis attended to, it is impossible for us to say we stand on independent\r\nground, impossible for a free mind not to see and to groan under the\r\nbondage in which it is bound. If anything after this could excite\r\nsurprise, it would be that they have been able so far to throw dust in the\r\neyes of our own citizens, as to fix on those who wish merely to recover\r\nself-government the charge of subserving one foreign influence, because\r\nthey resist submission to another. But they possess our printing presses,\r\na powerful engine in their government of us. At this very moment, they\r\nwould have drawn us into a war on the side of England, had it not been\r\nfor the failure of her bank. Such was their open and loud cry, and that\r\nof their gazettes till this event. After plunging us in all the broils of\r\nthe European nations, there would remain but one act to close our tragedy,\r\nthat is, to break up our Union; and even this they have ventured seriously\r\nand solemnly to propose and maintain by arguments in a Connecticut\r\npaper. I have been happy, however, in believing, from the stifling of\r\nthis effort, that that dose was found too strong, and excited as much\r\nrepugnance there as it did horror in other parts of our country, and that\r\nwhatever follies we may be led into as to foreign nations, we shall never\r\ngive up our Union, the last anchor of our hope, and that alone which is\r\nto prevent this heavenly country from becoming an arena of gladiators.\r\nMuch as I abhor war, and view it as the greatest scourge of mankind, and\r\nanxiously as I wish to keep out of the broils of Europe, I would yet go\r\nwith my brethren into these, rather than separate from them. But I hope we\r\nmay still keep clear of them, notwithstanding our present thraldom, and\r\nthat time may be given us to reflect on the awful crisis we have passed\r\nthrough, and to find some means of shielding ourselves in future from\r\nforeign influence, political, commercial, or in whatever other form it\r\nmay be attempted. I can scarcely withhold myself from joining in the wish\r\nof Silas Deane, that there were an ocean of fire between us and the old\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nA perfect confidence that you are as much attached to peace and union\r\nas myself, that you equally prize independence of all nations, and the\r\nblessings of self-government, has induced me freely to unbosom myself\r\nto you, and let you see the light in which I have viewed what has\r\nbeen passing among us from the beginning of the war. And I shall be\r\nhappy, at all times, in an intercommunication of sentiments with you,\r\nbelieving that the dispositions of the different parts of our country\r\nhave been considerably misrepresented and misunderstood in each part,\r\nas to the other, and that nothing but good can result from an exchange\r\nof information and opinions between those whose circumstances and morals\r\nadmit no doubt of the integrity of their views.\r\n\r\nI remain, with constant and sincere esteem, Dear Sir, your affectionate\r\nfriend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BELL.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, May 18, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose you a copy of the President's speech at the opening\r\nof Congress, from which you will see what were the objects in calling us\r\ntogether. When we first met, our information from the members from all\r\nparts of the Union, were that peace was the universal wish. Whether they\r\nwill now raise their tone to that of the Executive, and embark in all\r\nthe measures indicative of war, and, by taking a threatening posture,\r\nprovoke hostilities from the opposite party, is far from being certain.\r\nThere are many who think, that, not to support the Executive, is to\r\nabandon Government. As far as we can judge as yet, the changes in the\r\nlate election have been unfavorable to the Republican interest; still, we\r\nhope they will neither make nor provoke war. There appears no probability\r\nof any embargo, general or special; the bankruptcy of the English Bank\r\nis admitted to be complete, and nobody scarcely will venture to buy or\r\ndraw bills, lest they should be paid there in depreciated currency. They\r\nprefer remitting dollars, for which they will get an advanced price; but\r\nthis will drain us of our specie. Good James river tobacco is 8½ to 9\r\ndollars, flour 8½ to 9 dollars, wheat not saleable. The bankruptcies have\r\nbeen immense, but are rather at a stand. Be so good as to make known to\r\nour commercial friends of your place and Milton, the above commercial\r\nintelligence. Adieu.\r\n\r\nP. S.--Take care that nothing from my letter gets into the newspapers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GIROUD.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, May 22, 1797.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I received at this place, from Mr. Bache, the letter of 20th\r\nGerminal, with the seeds of the bread-tree which you were so kind as to\r\nsend me. I am happy that the casual circumstances respecting Oglethorpe's\r\naffairs, has led to this valuable present, and I shall take immediate\r\nmeasures to improve the opportunity it gives us of introducing so precious\r\na plant into our Southern States. The successive supplies of the same\r\nseeds which you are kind enough to give me expectations of receiving from\r\nyou, will, in like manner, be thankfully received, and distributed to\r\nthose persons and places most likely to render the experiment successful.\r\nOne service of this kind rendered to a nation, is worth more to them than\r\nall the victories of the most splendid pages of their history, and becomes\r\na source of exalted pleasure to those who have been instrumental to it.\r\nMay that pleasure be yours, and your name be pronounced with gratitude by\r\nthose who will at some future time be tasting the sweets of the blessings\r\nyou are now procuring them. With my thanks for this favor, accept\r\nassurances of the sentiments of esteem and regard with which I am, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PINCKNEY.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, May 29, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received from you, before you left England, a letter\r\nenclosing one from the Prince of Parma. As I learnt soon after that you\r\nwere shortly to return to America, I concluded to join my acknowledgments\r\nof it with my congratulations on your arrival; and both have been\r\ndelayed by a blameable spirit of procrastination, forever suggesting\r\nto our indolence that we need not do to-day what may be done to-morrow.\r\nAccept these now, in all the sincerity of my heart. It is but lately I\r\nhave answered the Prince's letter. It required some time to establish\r\narrangements which might effect his purpose, and I wished also to forward\r\na particular article or two of curiosity. You have found on your return a\r\nhigher style of political difference than you had left here. I fear this\r\nis inseparable from the different constitutions of the human mind, and\r\nthat degree of freedom which permits unrestrained expression. Political\r\ndissension is doubtless a less evil than the lethargy of despotism, but\r\nstill it is a great evil, and it would be as worthy the efforts of the\r\npatriot as of the philosopher, to exclude its influence, if possible,\r\nfrom social life. The good are rare enough at best. There is no reason\r\nto subdivide them by artificial lines. But whether we shall ever be able\r\nso far to perfect the principles of society, as that political opinions\r\nshall, in its intercourse, be as inoffensive as those of philosophy,\r\nmechanics, or any other, may be well doubted. Foreign influence is the\r\npresent and just object of public hue and cry, and, as often happens,\r\nthe most guilty are foremost and loudest in the cry. If those who are\r\ntruly independent, can so trim our vessel as to beat through the waves\r\nnow agitating us, they will merit a glory the greater as it seems less\r\npossible. When I contemplate the spirit which is driving us on here, and\r\nthat beyond the water which will view us as but a mouthful the more, I\r\nhave little hope of peace. I anticipate the burning of our sea ports,\r\nhavoc of our frontiers, household insurgency, with a long train of et\r\nceteras, which is enough for a man to have met once in his life. The\r\nexchange, which is to give us new neighbors in Louisiana (probably the\r\npresent French armies when disbanded) has opened us to a combination of\r\nenemies on that side where we are most vulnerable. War is not the best\r\nengine for us to resort to, nature has given us one in our commerce,\r\nwhich, if properly managed, will be a better instrument for obliging the\r\ninterested nations of Europe to treat us with justice. If the commercial\r\nregulations had been adopted which our Legislature were at one time\r\nproposing, we should at this moment have been standing on such an eminence\r\nof safety and respect as ages can never recover. But having wandered\r\nfrom that, our object should now be to get back, with as little loss as\r\npossible, and, when peace shall be restored to the world, endeavor so to\r\nform our commercial regulations as that justice from other nations shall\r\nbe their mechanical result. I am happy to assure you that the conduct\r\nof Gen. Pinckney has met universal approbation. It is marked with that\r\ncoolness, dignity, and good sense which we expected from him. I am told\r\nthat the French government had taken up an unhappy idea, that Monroe was\r\nrecalled for the candor of his conduct in what related to the British\r\nTreaty, and Gen. Pinckney was sent as having other dispositions towards\r\nthem. I learn further, that some of their well-informed citizens here are\r\nsetting them right as to Gen. Pinckney's dispositions, so well known to\r\nhave been just towards them; and I sincerely hope, not only that he may\r\nbe employed as Envoy Extraordinary to them, but that their minds will be\r\nbetter prepared to receive him. I candidly acknowledge, however, that I\r\ndo not think the speech and addresses of Congress as conciliatory as the\r\npreceding irritations on both sides would have rendered wise. I shall\r\nbe happy to hear from you at all times, to make myself useful to you\r\nwhenever opportunity offers, and to give every proof of the sincerity of\r\nthe sentiments of esteem and respect with which I am, Dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, May 30, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--I thank you for the pamphlet of Erskine enclosed in your\r\nfavor of the 9th instant, and still more for the evidence which your\r\nletter affords me of the health of your mind, and I hope of your body\r\nalso. Erskine has been reprinted here, and has done good. It has refreshed\r\nthe memory of those who had been willing to forget how the war between\r\nFrance and England had been produced; and who, apeing St. James', called\r\nit a defensive war on the part of England. I wish any events could\r\ninduce us to cease to copy such a model, and to assume the dignity of\r\nbeing original. They had their paper system, stockjobbing, speculations,\r\npublic debt, moneyed interest, &c., and all this was contrived for us.\r\nThey raised their cry against jacobinism and revolutionists, we against\r\ndemocratic societies and anti-federalists; their alarmists sounded\r\ninsurrection, ours marched an army to look for one, but they could not\r\nfind it. I wish the parallel may stop here, and that we may avoid, instead\r\nof imitating, a general bankruptcy and disastrous war.\r\n\r\nCongress, or rather the Representatives, have been a fortnight debating\r\nbetween a more or less irritating answer to the President's speech. The\r\nlatter was lost yesterday, by forty-eight against fifty-one or fifty-two.\r\nIt is believed, however, that when they come to propose measures leading\r\ndirectly to war, they will lose some of their numbers. Those who have\r\nno wish but for the peace of their country, and its independence of all\r\nforeign influence, have a hard struggle indeed, overwhelmed by a cry as\r\nloud and imposing as if it were true, of being under French influence, and\r\nthis raised by a faction composed of English subjects residing among us,\r\nor such as are English in all their relations and sentiments. However,\r\npatience will bring all to rights, and we shall both live to see the\r\nmask taken from their faces, and our citizens sensible on which side\r\ntrue liberty and independence are sought. Should any circumstance draw me\r\nfurther from home, I shall with great cordiality pay my respects to you at\r\nRose Hill, and am not without hope of meeting you here some time.\r\n\r\nHere, there, and everywhere else, I am with great and sincere attachment\r\nand respect, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, June 1, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 18th of May. The address of the Senate\r\nwas soon after that. The first draught was responsive to the speech, and\r\nhigher toned. Mr. Henry arrived the day it was reported; the addressers\r\nhad not yet their strength around them. They listened therefore to\r\nhis objections, recommitted the papers, added him and Tazewell to the\r\ncommittee, and it was reported with considerable alterations; but one\r\ngreat attack was made on it, which was to strike out the clause approving\r\neverything heretofore done by the executive. This clause was retained by a\r\nmajority of four. They received a new accession of members, held a caucus,\r\ntook up all the points recommended in the speech, except the raising\r\nmoney, agreed the list of every committee, and on Monday passed the\r\nresolutions and appointed the committees, by an uniform vote of seventeen\r\nto eleven. (Mr. Henry was accidentally absent; Ross not then come.)\r\nYesterday they took up the nomination of John Quincy Adams to Berlin,\r\nwhich had been objected to as extending our diplomatic establishment. It\r\nwas approved by eighteen to fourteen. (Mr. Tatnall accidentally absent.)\r\nFrom the proceedings we are able to see, that eighteen on the one side and\r\nten on the other, with two wavering votes, will decide every question.\r\nSchuyler is too ill to come this session, and Gunn has not yet come.\r\nPinckney (the General), John Marshall and Dana are nominated Envoys\r\nExtraordinary to France. Chas. Lee consulted a member from Virginia to\r\nknow whether Marshall would be agreeable. He named you, as more likely\r\nto give satisfaction. The answer was, \"Nobody of Mr. Madison's way of\r\nthinking will be appointed.\"\r\n\r\nThe representatives have not yet got through their addresses. An amendment\r\nof Mr. Nicholas', which you will have seen in the papers, was lost by a\r\ndivision of forty-six to fifty-two. A clause by Mr. Dayton, expressing\r\na wish that France might be put on an equal footing with other nations,\r\nwas inserted by fifty-two against forty-seven. This vote is most worthy\r\nof notice, because the moderation and justice of the proposition being\r\nunquestionable, it shows that there are forty-seven decided to go to all\r\nlengths to[6] * * * * * They have received a new orator from the district\r\nof Mr. Ames. He is the son of the Secretary of the Senate. They have an\r\naccession from South Carolina also, that State being exactly divided. In\r\nthe House of Representatives I learned the following facts, which give me\r\nreal concern. When the British treaty arrived at Charleston, a meeting,\r\nas you know, was called, and a committee of seventeen appointed, of whom\r\nGeneral Pinckney was one. He did not attend. They waited for him, sent\r\nfor him; he treated the mission with great hauteur, and disapproved of\r\ntheir meddling. In the course of the subsequent altercations, he declared\r\nthat his brother, T. Pinckney, approved of every article of the treaty,\r\nunder the existing circumstances, and since that time, the politics of\r\nCharleston have been assuming a different hue. Young Rutledge joining\r\nSmith and Harper, is an ominous fact as to that whole interest.\r\n\r\nTobacco is at nine dollars, and flour very dull of sale. A great\r\nstagnation in commerce generally. During the present bankruptcy in\r\nEngland, the merchants seem disposed to lie on their oars. It is\r\nimpossible to conjecture the rising of Congress, as it will depend on the\r\nsystem they decide on; whether of preparation for war, or inaction. In\r\nthe vote of forty-six to fifty-two, Morgan, Machir and Evans were of the\r\nmajority, and Clay kept his seat, refusing to vote with either. In that\r\nof forty-seven to fifty-two, Evans was the only one of our delegation who\r\nvoted against putting France on an equal footing with other nations.\r\n\r\nP. M. So far, I had written in the morning. I now take up my pen to add,\r\nthat the addresses having been reported to the House, it was moved to\r\ndisagree to so much of the amendment as went to the putting France on an\r\nequal footing with other nations, and Morgan and Machir turning tail, (in\r\nconsequence, as is said, of having been closeted last night by Charles\r\nLee,) the vote was forty-nine to fifty. So the principle was saved by\r\na single vote. They then proposed that compensations for spoliations\r\nshall be a _sine qua non_, and this will be decided on to-morrow. Yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [6] [A few lines are here illegible.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRENCH STROKER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, June 8, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In compliance with the desire you expressed in the few short\r\nmoments I had the pleasure of being with you at Fredericksburg, I shall\r\ngive you some account of what is passing here. The President's speech\r\nyou will have seen; and how far its aspects was turned towards war. Our\r\nopinion here is that the Executive had that in contemplation, and were not\r\nwithout expectation that the Legislature might catch the flame. A powerful\r\npart of that has shown a disposition to go all lengths with the Executive;\r\nand they have been able to persuade some of more moderate principles to\r\ngo so far with them as to join them in a very sturdy address. They have\r\nvoted the completing and manning the three frigates, and going on with\r\nthe fortifications. The Senate have gone much further, they have brought\r\nin bills for buying more armed vessels, sending them and the frigates\r\nout as convoys to our trade, raising more cavalry, more artillerists, and\r\nproviding a great army, to come into active service only, if necessary.\r\nThey have not decided whether they will permit the merchants to arm. The\r\nhope and belief is that the Representatives will concur in none of these\r\nmeasures, though their divisions hitherto have been so equal as to leave\r\nus under doubt and apprehension. The usual majorities have been from one\r\nto six votes, and these sometimes one way, sometimes the other. Three of\r\nthe Virginia members dividing from their colleagues occasion the whole\r\ndifficulty. If they decline these measures, we shall rise about the 17th\r\ninstant. It appears that the dispositions of the French government towards\r\nus wear a very angry cast indeed, and this before Pickering's letter to\r\nPinckney was known to them. We do not know what effect that may produce.\r\nWe expect Paine every day in a vessel from Havre, and Colonel Monroe in\r\none from Bordeaux. Tobacco keeps up at a high price and will still rise;\r\nflour is dull at $7 50. I am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                        PHILADELPHIA, June 15, 1797.--A. M.\r\n\r\nMy last was of the 8th instant. I had enclosed you separately a paper\r\ngiving you an account of Bonaparte's last great victory. Since which, we\r\nreceive information that the preliminaries of peace were signed between\r\nFrance and Austria. Mr. Hammond will have arrived at Vienna too late\r\nto influence terms. The victories lately obtained by the French on the\r\nRhine, were as splendid as Bonaparte's. The mutiny on board the English\r\nfleet, though allayed for the present, has impressed that country with\r\nterror. King has written letters to his friends recommending a pacific\r\nconduct towards France, notwithstanding the continuance of her injustices?\r\nVolney is convinced France will not make peace with England, because it\r\nis such an opportunity of sinking her as she never had and may not have\r\nagain. Bonaparte's army would have to march seven hundred miles to Calais.\r\nTherefore, it is imagined that the armies of the Rhine will be destined\r\nfor England. The Senate yesterday rejected on its second reading their\r\nown bill for raising four more companies of light dragoons, by a vote\r\nof 15 to 13. Their cost would have been about $120,000 a year. To-day\r\nthe bill for manning the frigates and buying nine vessels (about $60,000\r\neach,) comes to its third reading. Some flatter us we may throw it out.\r\nThe trial will be in time to mention the issue herein. The bills for\r\npreventing our citizens from engaging in armed vessels of either party,\r\nand for prohibiting exportation of arms and ammunition, have passed both\r\nHouses. The fortification bill is before the Representatives still. It is\r\nthought by many that with all the mollifying clauses they can give it,\r\nit may perhaps be thrown out. They have a separate bill for manning the\r\nthree frigates, but its fate is uncertain. These are probably the ultimate\r\nmeasures which will be adopted, if even these will be adopted. The folly\r\nof the convocation of Congress at so inconvenient a season and an expense\r\nof $60,000, is now palpable to everybody; or rather it is palpable that\r\nwar was the object, since, that being out of the question, it is evident\r\nthere is nothing else. However, nothing less than the miraculous string\r\nof events which have taken place, to wit, the victories of the Rhine and\r\nItaly, peace with Austria, bankruptcy of England, mutiny in her fleet, and\r\nKing's writing letters recommending peace, could have cooled the fury of\r\nthe British faction. Even all that will not prevent considerable efforts\r\nstill in both parties to show our teeth to France. We had hoped to have\r\nrisen this week. It is now talked of for the 24th, but it is impossible\r\nyet to affix a time. I think I cannot omit being at our court (July 3,)\r\nwhether Congress rises or not. If so, I shall be with you on the Friday or\r\nSaturday preceding. I have a couple of pamphlets for you, (Utrum Horum,\r\nand Paine's Agrarian Justice,) being the only things since Erskine which\r\nhave appeared worth notice. Besides Bache's paper there are two others now\r\naccommodated to country circulation. Grile's (successor of Oswald) twice\r\na week without advertisements at four dollars. His debates in Congress\r\nare the same with Claypole's. Also Smith proposes to issue a paper once\r\na week, of news only, and an additional sheet while Congress shall be\r\nin session, price four dollars. The best daily papers now are Bradford's\r\ncompiled by Loyd, and Marshland and Cary's. Claypole's you know. Have you\r\nremarked the pieces signed Fabius? they are written by John Dickinson.\r\n\r\nP. M. The bill before the Senate for equipping the three frigates, and\r\nbuying nine vessels of not more than twenty guns, has this day passed\r\non its third reading by 16 against 13. The fortification bill before the\r\nRepresentatives as amended in committee of the whole, passed to its third\r\nreading by 48 against 41. Adieu affectionately, with my best respects to\r\nMrs. Madison.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BURR.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, June 17, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The newspapers give so minutely what is passing in Congress,\r\nthat nothing of detail can be wanting for your information. Perhaps,\r\nhowever, some general view of our situation and prospects, since you left\r\nus, may not be unacceptable. At any rate, it will give me an opportunity\r\nof recalling myself to your memory, and of evidencing my esteem for you.\r\nYou well know how strong a character of division had been impressed on the\r\nSenate by the British treaty. Common error, common censure, and common\r\nefforts of defence had formed the treaty majority into a common band,\r\nwhich feared to separate even on other subjects. Towards the close of\r\nthe last Congress, however, it had been hoped that their ties began to\r\nloosen, and their phalanx to separate a little. This hope was blasted at\r\nthe very opening of the present session, by the nature of the appeal which\r\nthe President made to the nation; the occasion for which had confessedly\r\nsprung from the fatal British treaty. This circumstance rallied them\r\nagain to their standard, and hitherto we have had pretty regular treaty\r\nvotes on all questions of principle. And indeed I fear, that as long\r\nas the same individuals remain, so long we shall see traces of the same\r\ndivision. In the House of Representatives the republican body has also\r\nlost strength. The non-attendance of five or six of that description, has\r\nleft the majority very equivocal indeed. A few individuals of no fixed\r\nsystem at all, governed by the panic or the prowess of the moment, flap as\r\nthe breeze blows against the republican or the aristocratic bodies, and\r\ngive to the one or the other a preponderance entirely accidental. Hence\r\nthe dissimilar aspect of the address, and of the proceedings subsequent\r\nto that. The inflammatory composition of the speech excited sensations\r\nof resentment which had slept under British injuries, threw the wavering\r\ninto the war scale, and produced the war address. Bonaparte's victories\r\nand those on the Rhine, the Austrian peace, British bankruptcy, mutiny of\r\nthe seamen, and Mr. King's exhortations to pacific measures, have cooled\r\nthem down again, and the scale of peace preponderates. The threatening\r\npropositions therefore, founded in the address, are abandoned one by\r\none, and the cry begins now to be, that we have been called together to\r\ndo nothing. The truth is, there is nothing to do, the idea of war being\r\nscouted by the events of Europe; but this only proves that war was the\r\nobject for which we were called. It proves that the executive temper was\r\nfor war; and that the convocation of the Representatives was an experiment\r\nof the temper of the nation, to see if it was in unison. Efforts at\r\nnegotiation indeed were promised; but such a promise was as difficult\r\nto withhold, as easy to render nugatory. If negotiation alone had been\r\nmeant, that might have been pursued without so much delay, and without\r\ncalling the Representatives; and if strong and earnest negotiation had\r\nbeen meant, the additional nomination would have been of persons strongly\r\nand earnestly attached to the alliance of 1778. War then was intended.\r\nWhether abandoned or not, we must judge from future indications and\r\nevents; for the same secrecy and mystery are affected to be observed by\r\nthe present, which marked the former administration. I had always hoped,\r\nthat the popularity of the late President being once withdrawn from active\r\neffect, the natural feelings of the people towards liberty would restore\r\nthe equilibrium between the executive and legislative departments, which\r\nhad been destroyed by the superior weight and effect of that popularity;\r\nand that their natural feelings of moral obligation would discountenance\r\nthe ungrateful predilection of the executive in favor of Great Britain.\r\nBut unfortunately, the preceding measures had already alienated the nation\r\nwho were the object of them, had excited reaction from them, and this\r\nreaction has on the minds of our citizens an effect which supplies that\r\nof the Washington popularity. This effect was sensible on some of the late\r\ncongressional elections, and this it is which has lessened the republican\r\nmajority in Congress. When it will be reinforced, must depend on events,\r\nand these are so incalculable, that I consider the future character of\r\nour republic as in the air; indeed its future fortune will be in the air,\r\nif war is made on us by France, and if Louisiana becomes a Gallo-American\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nI have been much pleased to see a dawn of change in the spirit of your\r\nState. The late elections have indicated something, which, at a distance,\r\nwe do not understand. However, what with the English influence in the\r\nlower, and the Patroon influence in the upper part of your State, I\r\npresume little is to be hoped. If a prospect could be once opened upon us\r\nof the penetration of truth into the eastern States; if the people there,\r\nwho are unquestionably republicans, could discover that they have been\r\nduped into the support of measures calculated to sap the very foundations\r\nof republicanism, we might still hope for salvation, and that it would\r\ncome, as of old, from the east. But will that region ever awake to the\r\ntrue state of things? Can the middle, southern and western States hold\r\non till they awake? These are painful and doubtful questions; and if,\r\nin assuring me of your health, you can give me a comfortable solution of\r\nthem, it will relieve a mind devoted to the preservation of our republican\r\ngovernment in the true form and spirit in which it was established, but\r\nalmost oppressed with apprehensions that fraud will at length effect\r\nwhat force could not, and that what with currents and counter-currents,\r\nwe shall, in the end, be driven back to the land from which we launched\r\ntwenty years ago. Indeed, my dear Sir, we have been but a sturdy fish on\r\nthe hook of a dexterous angler, who, letting us flounce till we have spent\r\nour force, brings us up at last.\r\n\r\nI am tired of the scene, and this day se'nnight shall change it for one,\r\nwhere, to tranquillity of mind may be added pursuits of private utility,\r\nsince none public are admitted by the state of things.\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. Since writing the above, we have received a report that the French\r\nDirectory has proposed a declaration of war against the United States to\r\nthe Council of Ancients, who have rejected it. Thus we see two nations\r\nwho love one another affectionately, brought by the ill temper of their\r\nexecutive administrations, to the very brink of a necessity to imbrue\r\ntheir hands in the blood of each other.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, June 21, 1797.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--It was with infinite joy to me, that you were yesterday\r\nannounced to the Senate, as Envoy Extraordinary, jointly with General\r\nPinckney and Mr. Marshall, to the French Republic. It gave me certain\r\nassurance that there would be a preponderance in the mission, sincerely\r\ndisposed to be at peace with the French government and nation. Peace\r\nis undoubtedly at present the first object of our nation. Interest and\r\nhonor are also national considerations. But interest, duly weighed, is\r\nin favor of peace even at the expense of spoliations past and future;\r\nand honor cannot now be an object. The insults and injuries committed on\r\nus by both the belligerent parties, from the beginning of 1793 to this\r\nday, and still continuing, cannot now be wiped off by engaging in war\r\nwith one of them. As there is great reason to expect this is the last\r\ncampaign in Europe, it would certainly be better for us to rub through\r\nthis year, as we have done through the four preceding ones, and hope that\r\non the restoration of peace, we may be able to establish some plan for\r\nour foreign connections more likely to secure our peace, interest and\r\nhonor, in future. Our countrymen have divided themselves by such strong\r\naffections, to the French and the English, that nothing will secure us\r\ninternally but a divorce from both nations; and this must be the object\r\nof every real American, and its attainment is practicable without much\r\nself-denial. But for this, peace is necessary. Be assured of this, my\r\ndear Sir, that if we engage in a war during our present passions, and our\r\npresent weakness in some quarters, our Union runs the greatest risk of not\r\ncoming out of that war in the shape in which it enters it. My reliance for\r\nour preservation is in your acceptance of this mission. I know the tender\r\ncircumstances which will oppose themselves to it. But its duration will\r\nbe short, and its reward long. You have it in your power, by accepting and\r\ndetermining the character of the mission, to secure the present peace and\r\neternal union of your country. If you decline, on motives of private pain,\r\na substitute may be named who has enlisted his passions in the present\r\ncontest, and by the preponderance of his vote in the mission may entail\r\non us calamities, your share in which, and your feelings, will outweigh\r\nwhatever pain a temporary absence from your family could give you. The\r\nsacrifice will be short, the remorse would be never ending. Let me, then,\r\nmy dear Sir, conjure your acceptance, and that you will, by this act, seal\r\nthe mission with the confidence of all parties. Your nomination has given\r\na spring to hope, which was dead before.\r\n\r\nI leave this place in three days, and therefore shall not here have\r\nthe pleasure of learning your determination. But it will reach me in my\r\nretirement, and enrich the tranquillity of that scene. It will add to\r\nthe proofs which have convinced me that the man who loves his country on\r\nits own account, and not merely for its trappings of interest or power,\r\ncan never be divorced from it, can never refuse to come forward when he\r\nfinds that she is engaged in dangers which he has the means of warding\r\noff. Make then an effort, my friend, to renounce your domestic comforts\r\nfor a few months, and reflect that to be a good husband and good father\r\nat this moment, you must be also a good citizen. With sincere wishes for\r\nyour acceptance and success, I am, with unalterable esteem, dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, June 22, 1797.\r\n\r\nThe Senate have this day rejected their own bill for raising a provisional\r\narmy of 15,000 men. I think they will reject that for permitting private\r\nvessels to arm. The Representatives have thrown out the bill of the\r\nSenate for raising artillery. They (Wednesday) put off one forbidding\r\nour citizens to serve in foreign vessels of war till November, by a vote\r\nof fifty-two to forty-four. This day they came to a resolution proposing\r\nto the Senate to adjourn on Wednesday, the 28th, by a majority of four.\r\nThus it is now perfectly understood that the convocation of Congress is\r\nsubstantially condemned by their several decisions that nothing is to be\r\ndone. I may be with you somewhat later than I expected, say from the 1st\r\nto the 4th. Preliminaries of peace between Austria and France are signed.\r\n_Wane_ has declined the mission to France. Gerry is appointed in his room,\r\nbeing supported in Senate by the republican vote; six nays of the opposite\r\ndescription of Monroe or Payne. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD RUTLEDGE.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, June 24, 1797.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge your two favors of May the 4th and\r\n19th, and to thank you for your attentions to the commissions for the\r\npeas and oranges, which I learn have arrived in Virginia. Your draft I\r\nhope will soon follow on Mr. John Barnes, merchant, here; who, as I before\r\nadvised you, is directed to answer it.\r\n\r\nWhen Congress first met, the assemblage of facts presented in the\r\nPresident's speech, with the multiplied accounts of spoliations by the\r\nFrench West Indians, appeared by sundry votes on the address, to incline\r\na majority to put themselves in a posture of war. Under this influence\r\nthe address was formed, and its spirit would probably have been pursued\r\nby corresponding measures, had the events of Europe been of an ordinary\r\ntrain. But this has been so extraordinary, that numbers have gone over\r\nto those, who, from the first, feeling with sensibility the French\r\ninsults, as they had felt those of England before, thought now as they\r\nthought then, that war measures should be avoided, and those of peace\r\npursued. Their favorite engine, on the former occasion, was _commercial\r\nregulations_, in preference to negotiations, to war preparations and\r\nincrease of debt. On the latter, as we have no commerce with France, the\r\nrestriction of which could press on them, they wished for negotiation.\r\nThose of the opposite sentiment had, on the former occasion, preferred\r\nnegotiation, but at the same time voted for great war preparations, and\r\nincrease of debt; now also they were for negotiation, war preparations\r\nand debt. The parties have in debate mutually charged each other with\r\ninconsistency, and with being governed by an attachment to this or that\r\nof the belligerent nations, rather than the dictates of reason and pure\r\nAmericanism. But, in truth, both have been consistent; the same men\r\nhaving voted for war measures who did before, and the same against them\r\nnow who did before. The events of Europe coming to us in astonishing and\r\nrapid succession, to wit, the public bankruptcy of England, Buonaparte's\r\nsuccesses, the successes on the Rhine, the Austrian peace, mutiny of the\r\nBritish fleet, Irish insurrection, a demand of forty-three millions for\r\nthe current services of the year, and, above all, the warning voice, as\r\nis said, of Mr. King, to abandon all thought of connection with Great\r\nBritain, that she is going down irrecoverably, and will sink us also, if\r\nwe do not clear ourselves, have brought over several to the pacific party,\r\nso as, at present, to give majorities against all threatening measures.\r\nThey go on with frigates and fortifications, because they were going on\r\nwith them before. They direct eighty thousand of their militia to hold\r\nthemselves in readiness for service. But they reject the propositions to\r\nraise cavalry, artillery, and a provisional army, and to trust private\r\nships with arms in the present combustible state of things. They believe\r\nthe present is the last campaign of Europe, and wish to rub through\r\nthis fragment of a year as they have through the four preceding ones,\r\nopposing patience to insult, and interest to honor. They will, therefore,\r\nimmediately adjourn. This is, indeed, a most humiliating state of things,\r\nbut it commenced in 1793. Causes have been adding to causes, and effects\r\naccumulating on effects, from that time to this. We had, in 1793, the most\r\nrespectable character in the universe. What the neutral nations think of\r\nus now, I know not; but we are low indeed with the belligerents. Their\r\nkicks and cuffs prove their contempt. If we weather the present storm, I\r\nhope we shall avail ourselves of the calm of peace, to place our foreign\r\nconnections under a new and different arrangement. We must make the\r\ninterest of every nation stand surety for their justice, and their own\r\nloss to follow injury to us, as effect follows its cause. As to everything\r\nexcept commerce, we ought to divorce ourselves from them all. But this\r\nsystem would require time, temper, wisdom, and occasional sacrifice of\r\ninterest; and how far all of these will be ours, our children may see,\r\nbut we shall not. The passions are too high at present, to be cooled in\r\nour day. You and I have formerly seen warm debates and high political\r\npassions. But gentlemen of different politics would then speak to each\r\nother, and separate the business of the Senate from that of society. It is\r\nnot so now. Men who have been intimate all their lives, cross the streets\r\nto avoid meeting, and turn their heads another way, lest they should be\r\nobliged to touch their hats. This may do for young men with whom passion\r\nis enjoyment. But it is afflicting to peaceable minds. Tranquillity is\r\nthe old man's milk. I go to enjoy it in a few days, and to exchange the\r\nroar and tumult of bulls and bears, for the prattle of my grand-children\r\nand senile rest. Be these yours, my dear friend, through long years, with\r\nevery other blessing, and the attachment of friends as warm and sincere,\r\nas yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, June 27, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of May\r\n26th and 29th, which came to hand in due time, and relieved my mind\r\nconsiderably, though it was not finally done. During the vacation we may\r\nperhaps be able to hunt up the letters which are wanting, and get this\r\ntornado which has been threatening us, dissipated.\r\n\r\nYou have seen the speech and the address, so nothing need be said on them.\r\nThe spirit of both has been so whittled down by Bonaparte's victories,\r\nthe victories on the Rhine, the Austrian peace, Irish insurgency, English\r\nbankruptcy, insubordination of the fleet, &c., that Congress is rejecting\r\none by one the measures brought in on the principles of their own address.\r\nBut nothing less than such miraculous events as have been pouring in on\r\nus from the first of our convening could have assuaged the fermentation\r\nproduced in men's minds. In consequence of these events, what was the\r\nmajority at first, is by degrees become the minority, so that we may\r\nsay that in the Representatives moderation will govern. But nothing\r\ncan establish firmly the republican principles of our government but an\r\nestablishment of them in England. France will be the apostle for this.\r\nWe very much fear that Gerry will not accept the mission to Paris. The\r\ndelays which have attended this measure have left a dangerous void in our\r\nendeavors to preserve peace, which can scarcely be reconciled to a wish to\r\npreserve it. I imagine we shall rise from the 1st to the 3d of July. I am,\r\nDear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\nP. S. The interruption of letters is becoming so notorious, that I am\r\nforming a resolution of declining correspondence with my friends through\r\nthe channels of the Post Office altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 3, 1797.\r\n\r\nI scribbled you a line on the 24th ultimo; it missed of the post, and\r\nso went by a private hand. I perceive from yours by Mr. Bringhurst, that\r\nyou had not received it. In fact, it was only an earnest exhortation to\r\ncome here with Monroe, which I still hope you will do. In the meantime,\r\nI enclose you a letter from him, and wish your opinion on its principal\r\nsubject. The variety of other topics the day I was with you, kept out\r\nof sight the letter to Mazzei imputed to me in the papers, the general\r\nsubstance of which is mine, though the diction has been considerably\r\naltered and varied in the course of its translations from English into\r\nItalian, from Italian into French, and from French into English. I first\r\nmet with it at Bladensburg, and for a moment conceived I must take the\r\nfield of the public papers. I could not disavow it wholly, because the\r\ngreatest part was mine, in substance though not in form. I could not avow\r\nit as it stood, because the form was not mine, and, in one place, the\r\nsubstance very materially falsified. This, then, would render explanations\r\nnecessary; nay, it would render proofs of the whole necessary, and draw\r\nme at length into a publication of all (even the secret) transactions of\r\nthe administration while I was in it; and embroil me personally with every\r\nmember of the executive, with the judiciary, and with others still. I soon\r\ndecided in my own mind, to be entirely silent. I consulted with several\r\nfriends at Philadelphia, who, every one of them, were clearly against\r\nmy avowing or disavowing, and some of them conjured me most earnestly to\r\nlet nothing provoke me to it. I corrected, in conversation with them, a\r\nsubstantial misrepresentation in the copy published. The original has a\r\nsentiment like this (for I have it not before me), \"they are endeavoring\r\nto submit us to the substance, as they already have to the _forms_ of\r\nthe British government;\" meaning by _forms_, the birth-days, levees,\r\nprocessions to parliament, inauguration pomposities, &c. But the copy\r\npublished says, \"as they have already submitted us to the _form_ of the\r\nBritish,\" &c., making me express hostility to the form of our government,\r\nthat is to say, to the Constitution itself. For this is really the\r\ndifference of the word _form_, used in the singular or plural, in that\r\nphrase, in the English language. Now it would be impossible for me to\r\nexplain this publicly, without bringing on a personal difference between\r\nGeneral Washington and myself, which nothing before the publication\r\nof this letter has ever done. It would embroil me also with all those\r\nwith whom his character is still popular, that is to say, nine tenths\r\nof the people of the United States; and what good would be obtained by\r\navowing the letter with the necessary explanations? Very little indeed,\r\nin my opinion, to counterbalance a good deal of harm. From my silence\r\nin this instance, it cannot be inferred that I am afraid to own the\r\ngeneral sentiments of the letter. If I am subject to either imputation,\r\nit is to that of avowing such sentiments too frankly both in private and\r\npublic, often when there is no necessity for it, merely because I disdain\r\neverything like duplicity. Still, however, I am open to conviction. Think\r\nfor me on the occasion, and advise me what to do, and confer with Colonel\r\nMonroe on the subject.\r\n\r\nLet me entreat you again to come with him; there are other important\r\nthings to consult on. One will be his affair. Another is the subject of\r\nthe petition now enclosed you, to be proposed to our district, on the late\r\npresentment of our representative by the grand jury: the idea it brings\r\nforward is still confined to my own breast. It has never been mentioned\r\nto any mortal, because I first wish your opinion on the expediency of the\r\nmeasure. If you approve it, I shall propose to * * * * * or some other,[7]\r\nto father it, and to present it to the counties at their general muster.\r\nThis will be in time for our Assembly. The presentment going in the\r\npublic papers just at the moment when Congress was together, produced a\r\ngreat effect both on its friends and foes in that body, very much to the\r\ndisheartening and mortification of the latter. I wish this petition, if\r\napproved, to arrive there under the same circumstances, to produce the\r\ncounter effect so wanting for their gratification. I could have wished to\r\nreceive it from you again at our court on Monday, because * * * * * and\r\n* * * * * will be there, and might also be consulted, and commence measures\r\nfor putting it into motion. If you can return it then, with your opinion,\r\nit will be of importance. Present me affectionately to Mrs. Madison, and\r\nconvey to her my entreaties to interpose her good offices and persuasives\r\nwith you to bring her here, and before we uncover our house, which will\r\nyet be some weeks.\r\n\r\nSalutations and adieu.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [7] [The places in this letter where the asterisks are inserted,\r\n         are blanks in the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COL. JOHN STUART.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 15, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--With great pleasure I forward to you the Diploma of the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society, adopting you into their body. The\r\nattention on your part, to which they are indebted for the knowledge that\r\nsuch an animal has existed as the Megalonyx, as we have named him, gives\r\nthem reason to hope that the same attention continued will enrich us with\r\nother objects of science, which your part of the country may yet, we hope,\r\nfurnish. On my arrival at Philadelphia, I met with an account published in\r\nSpain of the skeleton of an enormous animal from Paraguay, of the clawed\r\nkind, but not of the lion class at all; indeed, it is classed with the\r\nsloth, ant-eater, &c., which are not of the carnivorous kinds; it was dug\r\nup 100 feet below the surface, near the river La Plata. The skeleton is\r\nnow mounted at Madrid, is 12 feet long and 6 feet high. There are several\r\ncircumstances which lead to a supposition that our megalonyx may have\r\nbeen the same animal with this. There are others which still induce us\r\nto class him with the lion. Since this discovery has led to questioning\r\nthe Indians as to this animal, we have received some of their traditions\r\nwhich confirm his classification with the lion. As soon as our 4th volume\r\nof transactions, now in the press, shall be printed, I will furnish you\r\nwith the account given in to the Society. I take for granted that you\r\nhave little hope of recovering any more of the bones. Those sent me are\r\ndelivered to the society. I am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ST. GEORGE TUCKER.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 28, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of the\r\n2d and 22d instant, and to thank you for the pamphlet covered by the\r\nformer. You know my subscription to its doctrines; and as to the mode of\r\nemancipation, I am satisfied that that must be a matter of compromise\r\nbetween the passions, the prejudices, and the real difficulties which\r\nwill each have their weight in that operation. Perhaps the first chapter\r\nof this history, which has begun in St. Domingo, and the next succeeding\r\nones, which will recount how all the whites were driven from all the other\r\nislands, may prepare our minds for a peaceable accommodation between\r\njustice, policy and necessity; and furnish an answer to the difficult\r\nquestion, whither shall the colored emigrants go? and the sooner we put\r\nsome plan under way, the greater hope there is that it may be permitted\r\nto proceed peaceably to its ultimate effect. But if something is not\r\ndone, and soon done, we shall be the murderers of our own children. The\r\n\"murmura venturos nautis prudentia ventos\" has already reached us; the\r\nrevolutionary storm, now sweeping the globe, will be upon us, and happy\r\nif we make timely provision to give it an easy passage over our land.\r\nFrom the present state of things in Europe and America, the day which\r\nbegins our combustion must be near at hand; and only a single spark is\r\nwanting to make that day to-morrow. If we had begun sooner, we might\r\nprobably have been allowed a lengthier operation to clear ourselves, but\r\nevery day's delay lessens the time we may take for emancipation. Some\r\npeople derive hope from the aid of the confederated States. But this is a\r\ndelusion. There is but one State in the Union which will aid us sincerely,\r\nif an insurrection begins, and that one may, perhaps, have its own fire\r\nto quench at the same time. The facts stated in yours of the 22d, were\r\nnot identically known to me, but others like them were. From the General\r\nGovernment no interference need be expected. Even the merchant and\r\nnavigator, the immediate sufferers, are prevented by various motives from\r\nwishing to be redressed. I see nothing but a State procedure which can\r\nvindicate us from the insult. It is in the power of any single magistrate,\r\nor of the Attorney for the Commonwealth, to lay hold of the commanding\r\nofficer, whenever he comes ashore, for the breach of the peace, and to\r\nproceed against him by indictment. This is so plain an operation, that no\r\npower can prevent its being carried through with effect, but the want of\r\nwill in the officers of the State. I think that the matter of finances,\r\nwhich has set the people of Europe to thinking, is now advanced to that\r\npoint with us, that the next step, and it is an unavoidable one, a land\r\ntax, will awaken our constituents, and call for inspection into past\r\nproceedings. I am, with great esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL ARTHUR CAMPBELL.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 1, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of July the\r\n4th, and to recognize in it the sentiments you have ever held, and worthy\r\nof the day on which it is dated. It is true that a party has risen up\r\namong us, or rather has come among us, which is endeavoring to separate\r\nus from all friendly connection with France, to unite our destinies with\r\nthose of Great Britain, and to assimilate our government to theirs. Our\r\nlenity in permitting the return of the old tories, gave the first body\r\nto this party; they have been increased by large importations of British\r\nmerchants and factors, by American merchants dealing on British capital,\r\nand by stock dealers and banking companies, who, by the aid of a paper\r\nsystem, are enriching themselves to the ruin of our country, and swaying\r\nthe government by their possession of the printing presses, which their\r\nwealth commands, and by other means, not always honorable to the character\r\nof our countrymen. Hitherto, their influence and their system have been\r\nirresistible, and they have raised up an executive power which is too\r\nstrong for the Legislature. But I flatter myself they have passed their\r\nzenith. The people, while these things were doing, were lulled into\r\nrest and security from a cause which no longer exists. No prepossessions\r\nnow will shut their ears to truth. They begin to see to what port their\r\nleaders were steering during their slumbers, and there is yet time to\r\nhaul in, if we can avoid a war with France. All can be done peaceably,\r\nby the people confining their choice of Representatives and Senators to\r\npersons attached to republican government and the principles of 1776, not\r\noffice-hunters, but farmers, whose interests are entirely agricultural.\r\nSuch men are the true representatives of the great American interest, and\r\nare alone to be relied on for expressing the proper American sentiments.\r\nWe owe gratitude to France, justice to England, good will to all, and\r\nsubservience to none. All this must be brought about by the people, using\r\ntheir elective rights with prudence and self-possession, and not suffering\r\nthemselves to be duped by treacherous emissaries. It was by the sober\r\nsense of our citizens that we were safely and steadily conducted from\r\nmonarchy to republicanism, and it is by the same agency alone we can be\r\nkept from falling back. I am happy in this occasion of reviving the memory\r\nof old things, and of assuring you of the continuance of the esteem and\r\nrespect of, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN F. MERCER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 5, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--We have now with us our friend Monroe. He is engaged in stating\r\nhis conduct for the information of the public. As yet, however, he has\r\ndone little, being too much occupied with re-arranging his household. His\r\npreliminary skirmish with the Secretary of State has, of course, bespoke a\r\nsuspension of the public mind, till he can lay his statement before them.\r\nOur Congressional district is fermenting under the presentiment of their\r\nrepresentative by the Grand Jury; and the question of a Convention for\r\nforming a State Constitution will probably be attended to in these parts.\r\nThese are the news of our Canton. Those of a more public nature you know\r\nbefore we do. My best respects to Mrs. Mercer, and assurances to yourself\r\nof the affectionate esteem of, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 7, 1797.\r\n\r\nThe doubt which you suggest as to our jurisdiction over the case of the\r\nGrand Jury _vs._ Cabell, had occurred to me, and naturally occurs on first\r\nview of the question. But I knew, that to send the petition to the House\r\nof Representatives in Congress, would make bad worse; that a majority\r\nof that House would pass a vote of approbation. On examination of the\r\nquestion, too, it appeared to me that we could maintain the authority of\r\nour own government over it.\r\n\r\nA right of free correspondence between citizen and citizen, on their joint\r\ninterests, whether public or private, and under whatsoever laws these\r\ninterests arise, (to wit, of the State, of Congress, of France, Spain,\r\nor Turkey), is a natural right; it is not the gift of any municipal law,\r\neither of England, or Virginia, or of Congress; but in common with all our\r\nother natural rights, it is one of the objects for the protection of which\r\nsociety is formed, and municipal laws established.\r\n\r\nThe courts of this commonwealth (and among them the General Court, as a\r\ncourt of impeachment) are originally competent to the cognizance of all\r\ninfractions of the rights of one citizen by another citizen; and they\r\nstill retain all their judiciary cognizances not expressly alienated by\r\nthe federal Constitution.\r\n\r\nThe federal Constitution alienates from them all cases arising 1st,\r\nunder the constitution; 2dly, under the laws of Congress; 3dly, under\r\ntreaties, &c. But this right of free correspondence, whether with a public\r\nrepresentative in General Assembly, in Congress, in France, in Spain, or\r\nwith a private one charged with pecuniary trust, or with a private friend\r\nthe object of our esteem, or any other, has not been given to us under,\r\n1st, the federal Constitution; 2dly, any law of Congress; or 3dly, any\r\ntreaty; but as before observed, by nature. It is therefore not alienated,\r\nbut remains under the protection of our courts.\r\n\r\nWere the question even doubtful, that is no reason for abandoning it. The\r\nsystem of the General Government, is to seize all doubtful ground. We must\r\njoin in the scramble, or get nothing. Where first occupancy is to give\r\nright, he who lies still loses all. Besides, it is not right for those who\r\nare only to act in a preliminary form, to let their own doubts preclude\r\nthe judgment of the court of ultimate decision. We ought to let it go\r\nto the House of Delegates for their consideration, and they, unless the\r\ncontrary be palpable, ought to let it to go to the General Court, who are\r\nultimately to decide on it.\r\n\r\nIt is of immense consequence that the States retain as complete authority\r\nas possible over their own citizens. The withdrawing themselves under\r\nthe shelter of a foreign jurisdiction, is so subversive of order and so\r\npregnant of abuse, that it may not be amiss to consider how far a law\r\nof _præmunire_ should be revised and modified, against all citizens who\r\nattempt to carry their causes before any other than the State courts, in\r\ncases where those other courts have no right to their cognizance. A plea\r\nto the jurisdiction of the courts of their State, or a reclamation of a\r\nforeign jurisdiction, if adjudged valid, would be safe; but if adjudged\r\ninvalid, would be followed by the punishment of _præmunire_ for the\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\nThink further of the preceding part of this letter, and we will have\r\nfurther conference on it. Adieu.\r\n\r\nP. S. Observe, that it is not the breach of Mr. Cabell's privilege which\r\nwe mean to punish: that might lie with Congress. It is the wrong done to\r\nthe citizens of our district. Congress gave no authority to punish that\r\nwrong. They can only take cognizance of it in vindication of their member.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALEXANDER WHITE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 10, 1797.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--So many persons have of late found an interest or a passion\r\ngratified by imputing to me sayings and writings which I never said\r\nor wrote, or by endeavoring to draw me into newspapers to harass me\r\npersonally, that I have found it necessary for my quiet and my other\r\npursuits to leave them in full possession of the field, and not to take\r\nthe trouble of contradicting them even in private conversation. If I do it\r\nnow, it is out of respect to your application, made by private letter and\r\nnot through the newspapers, and under the perfect assurance that what I\r\nwrite to you will not be permitted to get in a newspaper, while you are at\r\nfull liberty to assert it in conversation under my authority.\r\n\r\nI never gave an opinion that the Government would not remove to the\r\nfederal city. I never entertained that opinion; but on the contrary,\r\nwhenever asked the question, I have expressed my full confidence that\r\nthey would remove there. Having had frequent occasion to declare this\r\nsentiment, I have endeavored to conjecture on what a contrary one could\r\nhave been ascribed to me. I remember that in Georgetown, where I passed a\r\nday in February in conversation with several gentlemen on the preparations\r\nthere for receiving the government, an opinion was expressed by some, and\r\nnot privately, that there would be few or no private buildings erected in\r\nWashington this summer, and that the prospect of there being a sufficient\r\nnumber in time, was not flattering. This they grounded on the fact that\r\nthe persons holding lots, from a view to increase their means of building,\r\nhad converted their money at low prices, into Morris and Nicholson's\r\nnotes, then possessing a good degree of credit, and that having lost\r\nthese by the failure of these gentlemen, they were much less able to build\r\nthan they would have been. I then observed, and I did it with a view to\r\nexcite exertion, that if there should not be private houses in readiness\r\nsufficient for the accommodation of Congress and the persons annexed\r\nto the Government, it could not be expected that men should come there\r\nto lodge, like cattle, in the fields, and that it highly behoved those\r\ninterested in the removal to use every exertion to provide accommodations.\r\nIn this opinion, I presume I shall be joined by yourself and every other.\r\nBut delivered, as it was, only on the hypothesis of a fact stated by\r\nothers, it could not authorize the assertion of an absolute opinion,\r\nseparated from the statement of facts on which it was hypothetically\r\ngrounded. I have seen no reason to believe that Congress have changed\r\ntheir purpose with respect to the removal. Every public indication from\r\nthem, and every sentiment I have heard privately expressed by the members,\r\nconvinces me they are steady in the purpose. Being on this subject, I\r\nwill suggest to you, what I did privately at Georgetown to a particular\r\nperson, in confidence that it should be suggested to the managers, if in\r\nevent it should happen that there should not be a sufficiency of private\r\nbuildings erected within the proper time, would it not be better for the\r\ncommissioners to apply for a suspension of the removal for one year, than\r\nto leave it to the hazard which a contrary interest might otherwise bring\r\non it? Of this however you have yet two summers to consider, and you\r\nhave the best knowledge of the circumstances on which a judgment may be\r\nformed whether private accommodations will be provided. As to the public\r\nbuildings, every one seems to agree that they will be in readiness.\r\n\r\nI have for five or six years been encouraging the opening a direct road\r\nfrom the Southern part of this State, leading through this county to\r\nGeorgetown. The route proposed is from Georgetown by Colonel Alexander's,\r\nElk-run Church, Norman's Ford, Stevensburg, the Racoon Ford, the Marquis's\r\nRoad, Martin Key's Ford on the Rivanna, the mouth of Slate River, the high\r\nbridge on Appomattox, Prince Edward Courthouse, Charlotte Courthouse,\r\nCole's ferry on Stanton, Dix's ferry on Dan, Guilford Courthouse,\r\nSalisbury, Crosswell's ferry on Saluda, Ninety-six, Augusta. It is\r\nbelieved this road will shorten the distance along the continent one\r\nhundred miles. It will be to open anew only from Georgetown to Prince\r\nEdward Courthouse. An actual survey has been made from Stevensburg to\r\nGeorgetown, by which that much of the road will be shortened twenty miles,\r\nand be all a dead level. The difficulty is to get it first through Fairfax\r\nand Prince William. The counties after that will very readily carry it on.\r\nWe consider it as opening to us a direct road to the market of the federal\r\ncity, for all the beef and mutton we could raise, for which we have no\r\nmarket at present. I am in possession of the survey, and had thought of\r\ngetting the Bridge company at Georgetown to undertake to get the road\r\ncarried through Fairfax and Prince William, either by those counties or\r\nby themselves. But I have some apprehension that by pointing our road to\r\nthe bridge, it might get out of the level country, and be carried over the\r\nhills, which will be but a little above it. This would be inadmissible.\r\nPerhaps you could suggest some means of our getting over the obstacle\r\nof those two counties. I shall be very happy to concur in any measure\r\nwhich can effect all our purposes. I am with esteem, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MANN PAGE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             PHILADELPHIA, January 2, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I do not know whether you have seen some very furious abuse of\r\nme in the Baltimore papers by a Mr. Luther Martin, on account of Logan's\r\nspeech, published in the \"Notes on Virginia.\" He supposes both the speech\r\nand story made by me to support an argument against Buffon. I mean not to\r\nenter into a newspaper contest with Mr. Martin; but I wish to collect, as\r\nwell as the lapse of time will permit, the evidence on which we received\r\nthat story. It was brought to us I remember by Lord Dunmore and his\r\nofficers on the return from the expedition of 1776. I am sure it was from\r\nthem I got it. As you were very much in the same circle of society in\r\nWilliamsburg with myself, I am in hopes your memory will be able to help\r\nout mine, and recall some facts which have escaped me. I ask it as a great\r\nfavor of you to endeavor to recollect, and to communicate to me all the\r\ncircumstances you possibly can relative to this matter, particularly the\r\nauthority on which we received it, and the names of any persons who you\r\nthink can give me information. I mean to fix the fact with all possible\r\ncare and truth, and either to establish or correct the former statement in\r\nan appendix to the \"Notes on Virginia,\" or in the first republication of\r\nthe work.\r\n\r\nCongress have done nothing interesting except postponing the Stamp Act.\r\nAn act continuing the currency of the foreign coins three years longer has\r\npassed the Representatives, but was lost in the Senate. We have hopes that\r\nour envoys will be received decently at Paris, and some compromise agreed\r\non. There seems to be little appearance of peace in Europe. Those among\r\nus who were so timid when they apprehended war with England, are now bold\r\nin propositions to arm. I do not think however that the Representatives\r\nwill change the policy pursued by them at their summer session. The land\r\ntax will not be brought forward this year. Congress of course have no real\r\nbusiness to be employed on. We may expect in a month or six weeks to hear\r\nso far from our commissioners at Paris as to judge what will be the aspect\r\nof our situation with France. If peaceable, as we hope, I know of nothing\r\nwhich should keep us together. In my late journey to this place, I came\r\nthrough Culpeper and Prince William to Georgetown. When I return, it will\r\nbe through the eastern shore (a country I have never seen), by Norfolk and\r\nPetersburg; so that I shall fail then also of the pleasure of seeing you.\r\nPresent respectful compliments to Mrs. Page, and accept assurances of the\r\nsincere esteem of, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                             PHILADELPHIA, January 3, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 25th came to hand yesterday. I shall observe\r\nyour directions with respect to the post day. I have spoken with the\r\nDeputy Post Master General on the subject of our Fredericksburg post. He\r\nnever knew before that the Fredericksburg printer had taken the contract\r\nof the rider. He will be glad, if either in your neighborhood or ours,\r\nsome good person will undertake to ride from April next. The price given\r\nthis year is three hundred and thirty dollars, and it will go to the\r\nlowest bidder who can be depended on. I understand (though not from him)\r\nthat Wyatt will be changed; and in general they determine that printers\r\nshall not be postmasters or riders.\r\n\r\nOur weather has been here, as with you, cold and dry. The thermometer has\r\nbeen at eight degrees. The river closed here the first week of December,\r\nwhich has caught a vast number of vessels destined for departure. It\r\ndeadens also the demand for wheat. The price at New York is one dollar\r\nseventy-five cents, and of flour eight dollars fifty cents to nine\r\ndollars; tobacco eleven to twelve dollars; there need be no doubt of\r\ngreater prices. The bankruptcies here continue: the prison is full of the\r\nmost reputable merchants, and it is understood that the scene has not yet\r\ngot to its height. Prices have fallen greatly. The market is cheaper than\r\nit has been for four years. Labor and house rent much reduced. Dry goods\r\nsomewhat. It is expected that they will fall till they get nearly to old\r\nprices. Money scarce beyond all example.\r\n\r\nThe Representatives have rejected the President's proposition for enabling\r\nhim to prorogue them. A law has passed putting off the stamp act till July\r\nnext. The land tax will not be brought on. The Secretary of the Treasury\r\nsays he has money enough. No doubt these two measures may be taken up more\r\nboldly at the next session, when most of the elections will be over. It\r\nis imagined the stamp act will be extended or attempted on every possible\r\nobject. A bill has passed the Representatives to suspend for three years\r\nthe law arresting the currency of foreign coins. The Senate propose an\r\namendment, continuing the currency of the foreign gold only. Very possibly\r\nthe bill may be lost. The object of opposing the bill is to make the\r\nFrench crowns a subject of speculation (for it seems they fell on the\r\nPresident's proclamation to a dollar in most of the States), and to force\r\nbank paper (for want of other medium) through all the States generally.\r\nTench Coxe is displaced, and no reason ever spoken of. It is therefore\r\nunderstood to be for his activity during the late election. It is said,\r\nthat the people from hence quite to the eastern extremity are beginning\r\nto be sensible that their government has been playing a foul game. In\r\nVermont, Chipman was elected Senator by a majority of one, against the\r\nrepublican candidate. In Maryland, Lloyd by a majority of one, against\r\nWinder the republican candidate. Tichenor chosen Governor of Vermont by a\r\nvery small majority. The House of Representatives of this State has become\r\nrepublican by a firm majority of six. Two counties, it is said, have come\r\nover generally to the republican side. It is thought the republicans have\r\nalso a majority in the New York House of Representatives. Hard elections\r\nare expected there between Jay and Livingston, and here between Ross\r\nand M'Kean. In the House of Representatives of Congress, the republican\r\ninterest has at present, on strong questions, a majority of about half\r\na dozen, as is conjectured, and there are as many of their firmest men\r\nabsent; not one of the anti-republicans is from his post. The bill for\r\npermitting private vessels to arm, was put off to the first Monday in\r\nFebruary by a sudden vote, and a majority of five. It was considered as an\r\nindex of their dispositions on that subject, though some voted both ways\r\non other ground. It is most evident, that the anti-republicans wish to\r\nget rid of Blount's impeachment. Many metaphysical niceties are handing\r\nabout in conversation, to show that it cannot be sustained. To show the\r\ncontrary, it is evident must be the task of the republicans, or of nobody.\r\nMonroe's book is considered as masterly by all those who are not opposed\r\nin principle, and it is deemed unanswerable. An answer, however, is\r\ncommenced in Fenno's paper of yesterday, under the signature of Scipio.\r\nThe real author not yet conjectured. As I take these papers merely to\r\npreserve them, I will forward them to you, as you can easily return them\r\nto me on my arrival at home; for I shall not see you on my way, as I\r\nmean to go by the Eastern Shore and Petersburg. Perhaps the paragraphs in\r\nsome of these abominable papers may draw from you now and then a squib. A\r\npamphlet of Fauchet's appeared yesterday. I send you a copy under another\r\ncover. A handbill has just arrived here from New York, where they learn\r\nfrom a vessel which left Havre about the 9th of November, that the Emperor\r\nhad signed the definitive articles, given up Mantua, evacuated Mentz,\r\nagreed to give passage to the French troops to Hanover, and that the\r\nPortuguese ambassador had been ordered to quit Paris, on account of the\r\nseizure of fort St. Julian's by the English, supposed with the connivance\r\nof Portugal. Though this is ordinary mercantile news, it looks like truth.\r\nThe latest official intelligence from Paris, is from Talleyrand to the\r\nFrench consul here, (Lastombe,) dated September the 28th, saying that our\r\nEnvoys were arrived, and would find every disposition on the part of his\r\ngovernment to accommodate with us.\r\n\r\nMy affectionate respects to Mrs. Madison; to yourself, health and\r\nfriendship. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 25, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 2d instant, on which day I received\r\nyours of December 25th. I have not resumed my pen, because there has\r\nreally been nothing worth writing about, but what you would see in the\r\nnewspapers. There is, as yet, no certainty what will be the aspect of our\r\naffairs with France. Either the Envoys have not written to the government,\r\nor their communications are hushed up. This last is suspected, because\r\nso many arrivals have happened from Bordeaux and Havre. The letters\r\nfrom American correspondents in France have been always to Boston; and\r\nthe experience we had last summer of their adroitness in counterfeiting\r\nthis kind of intelligence, inspires doubts as to their late paragraphs.\r\nA letter is certainly received here by an individual from Talleyrand,\r\nwhich says our Envoys have been heard, that their pretensions are high,\r\nthat possibly no arrangement may take place, but that there will be no\r\ndeclaration of war by France. It is said that Bournonville has written\r\nthat he has hopes of an accommodation (three audiences having then,\r\nNovember, been had), and to be himself a member of a new diplomatic\r\nmission to this country. On the whole, I am entirely suspended as to what\r\nis to be expected. The Representatives have been several days in debate on\r\nthe bill for foreign intercourse. A motion has been made to reduce it to\r\nwhat it was before the extension of 1796. The debate will probably have\r\ngood effects, in several ways, on the public mind, but the advocates for\r\nthe reformation expect to lose the question. They find themselves deceived\r\nin the expectation entertained in the beginning of the session, that they\r\nhad a majority. They now think the majority is on the other side by two\r\nor three, and there are moreover two or three of them absent. Blount's\r\naffair is to come on next. In the mean time the Senate have before them\r\na bill for regulating proceedings in impeachment. This will be made the\r\noccasion of offering a clause for the introduction of juries into these\r\ntrials. (Compare the paragraph in the Constitution which says, that all\r\ncrimes, _except in cases of impeachment_, shall be by jury, with the\r\neighth amendment, which says, that in _all_ criminal prosecutions the\r\ntrial shall be by jury.) There is no expectation of carrying this; because\r\nthe division in the Senate is of two to one, but it will draw forth the\r\nprinciples of the parties, and concur in accumulating proofs on which side\r\nall the sound principles are to be found.\r\n\r\nVery acrimonious altercations are going on between the Spanish minister\r\nand the executive, and at the Natchez something worse than mere\r\naltercation. If hostilities have not begun there, it has not been for want\r\nof endeavors to bring them on by our agents. Marshall, of Kentucky, this\r\nday proposed in Senate some amendments to the Constitution. They were\r\nbarely read just as we were adjourning, and not a word of explanation\r\ngiven. As far as I caught them in my ear, they went only to modifications\r\nof the elections of President and Vice President, by authorizing voters\r\nto add the office for which they name each, and giving to the Senate the\r\ndecision of a disputed election of President, and to the Representatives\r\nthat of Vice President. But I am apprehensive I caught the thing\r\nimperfectly, and probably incorrectly. Perhaps this occasion may be\r\ntaken of proposing again the Virginia amendments, as also to condemn\r\nelections by the legislatures, themselves to transfer the power of trying\r\nimpeachments from the Senate to some better constituted court, &c., &c.\r\n\r\nGood tobacco here is thirteen dollars, flour eight dollars and fifty\r\ncents, wheat one dollar and fifty cents, but dull, because only the\r\nmillers buy. The river, however, is nearly open, and the merchants will\r\nnow come to market and give a spur to the price. But the competition will\r\nnot be what it has been. Bankruptcies thicken, and the height of them has\r\nby no means yet come on. It is thought this winter will be very trying.\r\n\r\nFriendly salutations to Mrs. Madison. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nJanuary 28. I enclose Marshall's propositions. They have been this day\r\npostponed to the 1st of June, chiefly by the vote of the anti-republicans,\r\nunder the acknowledged fear that other amendments would be also proposed,\r\nand that this is not the time for agitating the public mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, February 8, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 25th ultimo; since which yours of the\r\n21st has been received. Bache had put five hundred copies of Monroe's\r\nbook on board a vessel, which was stopped by the early and unexpected\r\nfreezing of the river. He tried in vain to get them carried by fifties\r\nat a time, by the stage. The river is now open here, the vessels are\r\nfalling down, and if they can get through the ice below, the one with\r\nBache's packet will soon be at Richmond. It is surmised here that Scipio\r\nis written by C. Lee. Articles of impeachment were yesterday given in\r\nagainst Blount. But many great preliminary questions will arise. Must\r\nnot a _formal law_ settle the oath of the Senators, form of pleadings,\r\nprocess against person or goods, &c.? May he not appear by attorney? Must\r\nhe not be tried by a jury? Is a Senator impeachable? Is an ex-Senator\r\nimpeachable? You will readily conceive that these questions, to be settled\r\nby twenty-nine lawyers, are not likely to come to speedy issue. A very\r\ndisagreeable question of privilege has suspended all other proceedings for\r\nsome days. You will see this in the newspapers. The question of arming\r\nvessels came on, on Monday last; that morning, the President sent in an\r\ninflammatory message about a vessel taken and burnt by a French privateer,\r\nnear Charleston. Of this he had been possessed some time, and it had\r\nbeen through all the newspapers. It seemed to come in now _apropos_ for\r\nspurring on the disposition to arm. However, the question has not come on.\r\nIn the meantime, the general spirit, even of the merchants, is becoming\r\nadverse to it. In New Hampshire and Rhode Island they are unanimously\r\nagainst arming; so in Baltimore. This place is becoming more so. Boston\r\ndivided and desponding. I know nothing of New York; but I think there is\r\nno danger of the question being carried, unless something favorable to\r\nit is received from our Envoys. From them we hear nothing. Yet it seems\r\nreasonably believed that the executive has heard, and that it is something\r\nwhich would not promote their views of arming. For every action of theirs\r\nshows they are panting to come to blows. Giles has arrived.\r\n\r\nMy friendly salutations to Mrs. Madison. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 15, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 8th. We have still not a word from\r\nour Envoys. This long silence (if they have been silent) proves things\r\nare not going on very roughly. If they have not been silent, it proves\r\ntheir information, if made public, would check the disposition to arm. I\r\nhad flattered myself, from the progress of the public sentiment against\r\narming, that the same progress had taken place in the Legislature. But\r\nI am assured by those who have better opportunities of forming a good\r\njudgment, that if the question against arming is carried at all, it will\r\nnot be by more than a majority of two; and particularly, that there will\r\nnot be more than four votes against it from the five eastern States, or\r\nfive votes at the utmost. You will have perceived that Dayton has gone\r\nover completely. He expects to be appointed Secretary of War, in the room\r\nof M'Henry, who, it is said, will retire. He has been told, as report\r\ngoes, that they would not have confidence enough in him to appoint him.\r\nThe desire of inspiring them with more, seems the only way to account\r\nfor the eclat which he chooses to give to his conversion. You will have\r\nseen the disgusting proceedings in the case of Lyon: if they would have\r\naccepted even of a commitment to the serjeant, it might have been had.\r\nBut to get rid of his vote was the most material object. These proceedings\r\nmust degrade the General Government, and lead the people to lean more on\r\ntheir State governments, which have been sunk under the early popularity\r\nof the former. This day, the question of the jury in cases of impeachment\r\ncomes on. There is no doubt how it will go. The general division of the\r\nSenate is twenty-two and ten; and under the probable prospect of what it\r\nwill forever be, I see nothing in the mode of proceeding by impeachment\r\nbut the most formidable weapon for the purposes of dominant faction that\r\never was contrived. It would be the most effectual one of getting rid of\r\nany man whom they consider as dangerous to their views, and I do not know\r\nthat we could count on one-third in an emergency. All depends then on the\r\nHouse of Representatives, who are the impeachers; and there the majorities\r\nare of one, two, or three only; and these sometimes one way and sometimes\r\nanother: in a question of pure party they have the majority, and we do not\r\nknow what circumstances may turn up to increase that majority temporarily,\r\nif not permanently. I know of no solid purpose of punishment which the\r\ncourts of law are not equal to, and history shows, that in England,\r\nimpeachment has been an engine more of passion than justice. A great ball\r\nis to be given here on the 22d, and in other great towns of the Union.\r\nThis is, at least, very indelicate, and probably excites uneasy sensations\r\nin some. I see in it, however, this useful deduction, that the birth days\r\nwhich have been kept, have been, not those of the President, but of the\r\nGeneral. I enclose with the newspapers, the two acts of parliament passed\r\non the subject of our commerce, which are interesting. The merchants here\r\nsay, that the effect of the countervailing tonnage on American vessels,\r\nwill throw them completely out of employ as soon as there is peace. The\r\neastern members say nothing but among themselves. But it is said that it\r\nis working like gravel in their stomachs. Our only comfort is, that they\r\nhave brought it on themselves. My respectful salutation to Mrs. Madison;\r\nand to yourself, friendship and adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 21, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--I received duly your welcome favor of the 15th, and\r\nhad an opportunity of immediately delivering the one it enclosed to\r\nGeneral Kosciusko. I see him often, and with great pleasure mixed with\r\ncommiseration. He is as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known, and\r\nof that liberty which is to go to all, and not to the few or the rich\r\nalone. We are here under great anxiety to hear from our Envoys. * * * * *\r\nI agree with you, that some of our merchants have been milking the cow:\r\nyet the great mass of them have become deranged; they are daily falling\r\ndown by bankruptcies, and on the whole, the condition of our commerce\r\nfar less firm and really prosperous, than it would have been by the\r\nregular operations and steady advances which a state of peace would have\r\noccasioned. Were a war to take place, and throw our agriculture into equal\r\nconvulsions with our commerce, our business would be done at both ends.\r\nBut this I hope will not be. The good news from the Natchez has cut off\r\nthe fear of a breach in that quarter, where a crisis was brought on which\r\nhas astonished every one. How this mighty duel is to end between Great\r\nBritain and France, is a momentous question. The sea which divides them\r\nmakes it a game of chance; but it is narrow, and all the chances are not\r\non one side. Should they make peace, still our fate is problematical.\r\n\r\nThe countervailing acts of Great Britain, now laid before Congress,\r\nthreaten, in the opinion of merchants, the entire loss of our navigation\r\nto England. It makes a difference, from the present state of things,\r\nof five hundred guineas on a vessel of three hundred and fifty tons.\r\nIf, as the newspapers have told us, France has renewed her _Arret_ of\r\n1789, laying a duty of seven livres a hundred on all tobacco brought in\r\nforeign bottoms (even our own), and should extend it to rice and other\r\ncommodities, we are done, as navigators, to that country also. In fact, I\r\napprehend that those two great nations will think it their interest not to\r\npermit us to be navigators. France had thought otherwise, and had shown\r\nan equal desire to encourage our navigation as her own, while she hoped\r\nits weight would at least not be thrown into the scale of her enemies.\r\nShe sees now that that is not to be relied on, and will probably use\r\nher own means, and those of the nations under her influence, to exclude\r\nus from the ocean. How far it may lessen our happiness to be rendered\r\nmerely agricultural, how far that state is more friendly to principles of\r\nvirtue and liberty, are questions yet to be solved. Kosciusko has been\r\ndisappointed by the sudden peace between France and Austria. A ray of\r\nhope seemed to gleam on his mind for a moment, that the extension of the\r\nrevolutionary spirit through Italy and Germany, might so have occupied the\r\nremnants of monarchy there, as that his country might have risen again. I\r\nsincerely rejoice to find that you preserve your health so well. That you\r\nmay so go on to the end of the chapter, and that it may be a long one, I\r\nsincerely pray. Make my friendly salutations acceptable to Mrs. Gates, and\r\naccept yourself assurances of the great and constant esteem and respect\r\nof, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 22, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 12th is received. I wrote you last on the 15th,\r\nbut the letter getting misplaced, will only go by this post. We still\r\nhear nothing from our Envoys. Whether the executive hear, we know not.\r\nBut if war were to be apprehended, it is impossible our Envoys should\r\nnot find means of putting us on our guard, or that the executive should\r\nhold back their information. No news, therefore, is good news. The\r\ncountervailing act, which I sent you by the last post, will, confessedly,\r\nput American bottoms out of employ in our trade with Great Britain. So\r\nsay well-informed merchants. Indeed, it seems probable, when we consider\r\nthat hitherto, with the advantage of our foreign tonnage, our vessels\r\ncould only share with the British, and the countervailing duties will,\r\nit is said, make a difference of five hundred guineas to our prejudice\r\non a ship of three hundred and fifty tons. Still the eastern men say\r\nnothing. Every appearance and consideration render it probable, that on\r\nthe restoration of peace, both France and Britain will consider it their\r\ninterest to exclude us from the ocean, by such peaceable means as are in\r\ntheir power. Should this take place, perhaps it may be thought just and\r\npolitic to give to our _native capitalists_ the monopoly of our internal\r\ncommerce. This may at once relieve us from the dangers of wars abroad and\r\nBritish thraldom at home. The news from the Natchez, of the delivery of\r\nthe posts, which you will see in the papers, is to be relied on. We have\r\nescaped a dangerous crisis there. The great contest between Israel and\r\nMorgan, of which you will see the papers full, is to be decided this day.\r\nIt is snowing fast at this time, and the most sloppy walking I ever saw.\r\nThis will be to the disadvantage of the party which has the most invalids.\r\nWhether the event will be known this evening, I am uncertain. I rather\r\npresume not, and therefore, that you will not learn it till next post.\r\n\r\nYou will see in the papers, the ground on which the introduction of the\r\njury into the trial by impeachment was advocated by Mr. Tazewell, and the\r\nfate of the question. Reader's motion, which I enclosed you, will probably\r\nbe amended and established, so as to declare a Senator unimpeachable,\r\nabsolutely; and yesterday an opinion was declared, that not only officers\r\nof the State governments, but every private citizen of the United States,\r\nare impeachable. Whether they will think this the time to make the\r\ndeclaration, I know not; but if they bring it on, I think there will be\r\nnot more than two votes north of the Potomac against the universality of\r\nthe impeaching power. The system of the Senate may be inferred from their\r\ntransactions heretofore, and from the following declaration made to me\r\npersonally by their oracle.[8] \"No republic can ever be of any duration,\r\nwithout a Senate, and a Senate deeply and strongly rooted, strong enough\r\nto bear up against all popular storms and passions. The only fault in\r\nthe Constitution of our Senate is, that their term of office is not\r\ndurable enough. Hitherto they have done well, but probably they will be\r\nforced to give way in time.\" I suppose their having done well hitherto,\r\nalluded to the stand they made on the British treaty. This declaration\r\nmay be considered as their text; that they consider themselves as the\r\nbulwarks of the government, and will be rendering that the more secure, in\r\nproportion as they can assume greater powers. The foreign intercourse bill\r\nis set for to-day; but the parties are so equal on that in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, that they seem mutually to fear the encounter.\r\n\r\nMy friendly salutations to Mrs. Madison and the family. To yourself,\r\nfriendly adieus.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [8] [Here, in the margin of the copy filed, is written by the\r\n        author, in pencil, \"Mr. Adams.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PEREGRINE FITZHUGH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 23, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have yet to acknowledge your last favor which I received at\r\nMonticello, and therefore cannot now refer to the date. The perversion\r\nof the expressions of a former letter to you which you mention to have\r\nbeen made in the newspapers, I had not till then heard of. Yet the spirit\r\nof it was not new. I have been for some time used as the property of the\r\nnewspapers, a fair mark for every man's dirt. Some, too, have indulged\r\nthemselves in this exercise who would not have done it, had they known me\r\notherwise than through these impure and injurious channels. It is hard\r\ntreatment, and for a singular kind of offence, that of having obtained\r\nby the labors of a life the indulgent opinions of a part of one's fellow\r\ncitizens. However, these moral evils must be submitted to, like the\r\nphysical scourges of tempest, fire, &c. We are waiting with great anxiety\r\nto hear from our envoys at Paris. But the very circumstance of silence\r\nspeaks, I think, plain enough. If there were danger of war we should\r\ncertainly hear from them. It is impossible, if that were the aspect of\r\ntheir negotiations, that they should not find or make occasion of putting\r\nus on our guard, and of warning us to prepare. I consider therefore their\r\nsilence as a proof of peace. Indeed I had before imagined that when France\r\nhad thrown down the gauntlet to England, and was pointing all her energies\r\nto that object, her regard for the subsistence of her islands would\r\nkeep her from cutting off our resources from them. I hope, therefore,\r\nwe shall rub through the war, without engaging in it ourselves, and that\r\nwhen in a state of peace our Legislature and executive will endeavor to\r\nprovide peaceable means of obliging foreign nations to be just to us,\r\nand of making their injustice recoil on themselves. The advantages of\r\nour commerce to them may be made the engine for this purpose, provided\r\nwe shall be willing to submit to occasional sacrifices, which will be\r\nnothing in comparison with the calamities of war. Congress has nothing of\r\nany importance before them, except the bill on foreign intercourse, and\r\nthe proposition to arm our merchant vessels. These will be soon decided,\r\nand if we then get peaceable news from our envoys, I know of nothing which\r\nought to prevent our immediate separation. It had been expected that we\r\nmust have laid a land tax this session. However, it is thought we can get\r\nalong another year without it. Some very disagreeable differences have\r\ntaken place in Congress. They cannot fail to lessen the respect of the\r\npublic for the general government, and to replace their State governments\r\nin a greater degree of comparative respectability. I do not think it for\r\nthe interest of the general government itself, and still less of the Union\r\nat large, that the State governments should be so little respected as they\r\nhave been. However, I dare say that in time all these as well as their\r\ncentral government, like the planets revolving round their common sun,\r\nacting and acted upon according to their respective weights and distances,\r\nwill produce that beautiful equilibrium on which our Constitution is\r\nfounded, and which I believe it will exhibit to the world in a degree of\r\nperfection, unexampled but in the planetary system itself. The enlightened\r\nstatesman, therefore, will endeavor to preserve the weight and influence\r\nof every part, as too much given to any member of it would destroy the\r\ngeneral equilibrium. The ensuing month will probably be the most eventful\r\never yet seen in modern Europe. It may probably be the season preferred\r\nfor the projected invasion of England. It is indeed a game of chances. The\r\nsea which divides the combatants gives to fortune as well as to valor its\r\nshare of influence on the enterprise. But all the chances are not on one\r\nside. The subjugation of England would be a general calamity. But happily\r\nit is impossible. Should it end in her being only republicanized, I know\r\nnot on what principle a true republican of our country could lament it,\r\nwhether he considers it as extending the blessings of a purer government\r\nto other portions of mankind, or strengthening the cause of liberty in our\r\nown country by the influence of that example. I do not indeed wish to see\r\nany nation have a form of government forced on them; but if it is to be\r\ndone, I should rejoice at its being a free one. Permit me to place here\r\nthe tribute of my regrets for the affecting loss lately sustained within\r\nyour wall, and to add that of the esteem and respect with which I am, dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, March 2, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote to you last on the 22d ultimo; since which I have\r\nreceived yours without date, but probably of April the 18th or 19th. An\r\narrival to the eastward brings us some news, which you will see detailed\r\nin the papers. The new partition of Europe is sketched, but how far\r\nauthentic we know not. It has some probability in its favor. The French\r\nappear busy in their preparations for the invasion of England; nor is\r\nthere any appearance of movements on the part of Russia and Prussia which\r\nmight divert them from it.\r\n\r\nThe late birth-night has certainly sown tares among the exclusive\r\nfederalists. It has winnowed the grain from the chaff. The sincerely\r\nAdamites did not go. The Washingtonians went religiously, and took the\r\nsecession of the others in high dudgeon. The one sect threatens to desert\r\nthe levees, the other the parties. The whigs went in number, to encourage\r\nthe idea that the birth-nights hitherto kept had been for the General and\r\nnot the President, and of course that time would bring an end to them.\r\nGoodhue, Tracy, Sedgewick, &c., did not attend; but the three Secretaries\r\nand Attorney General did.\r\n\r\nWe were surprised, the last week, with a symptom of a disposition to\r\nrepeal the stamp act. Petitions for that purpose had come from Rhode\r\nIsland and Virginia, and had been committed to rest with the Ways and\r\nMeans. Mr. Harper, the chairman, in order to enter on the law for amending\r\nit, observed it would be necessary first to put the petitions for repeal\r\nout of the way, and moved an immediate decision on this. The Rhode\r\nIslanders begged and prayed for a postponement; that not knowing that this\r\nwas the next question to be called up, they were not at all prepared;\r\nbut Harper would show no mercy; not a moment's delay would be allowed.\r\nIt was taken up, and, on question without debate, determined in favor of\r\nthe petitions by a majority of ten. Astonished and confounded, when an\r\norder to bring in a bill for revisal was named, they began in turn to beg\r\nfor time; two weeks, one week, three days, one day; not a moment would\r\nbe yielded. They made three attempts for adjournment. But the majority\r\nappeared to grow. It was decided, by a majority of sixteen, that the bill\r\nshould be brought in. It was brought in the next day, and on the day after\r\npassed and was sent up to the Senate, who instantly sent it back rejected\r\nby a vote of fifteen to twelve. Rhode Island and New Hampshire voted for\r\nthe repeal in Senate. The act will therefore go into operation July the\r\n1st, but probably without amendments. However, I am persuaded it will\r\nbe short-lived. It has already excited great commotion in Vermont, and\r\ngrumblings in Connecticut. But they are so priest-ridden, that nothing is\r\nexpected from them, but the most bigoted passive obedience.\r\n\r\nNo news yet from our commissioners; but their silence is admitted to\r\naugur peace. There is no talk yet of the time of adjourning, though it is\r\nadmitted we have nothing to do, but what could be done in a fortnight or\r\nthree weeks. When the spring opens, and we hear from our commissioners, we\r\nshall probably draw pretty rapidly to a conclusion. A friend of mine here\r\nwishes to get a copy of Mazzei's Recherches Historiques et Politiques.\r\nWhere are they? Salutations and adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, March 15, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 2d instant. Yours of the 4th is now\r\nat hand. The public papers will give you the news of Europe. The French\r\ndecree making the vessel friendly or enemy, according to the hands by\r\nwhich the cargo was manufactured, has produced a great sensation among\r\nthe merchants here. Its operation is not yet perhaps well understood;\r\nbut probably it will put our shipping out of competition, because British\r\nbottoms, which can come under convoy, will alone be trusted with return\r\ncargoes. Ours, losing this benefit, would need a higher freight out, in\r\nwhich, therefore, they will be underbid by the British. They must then\r\nretire from the competition. Some no doubt will try other channels of\r\ncommerce, and return cargoes from other countries. This effect would be\r\nsalutary. A very well-informed merchant, too, (a Scotchman, entirely in\r\nthe English trade,) told me, he thought it would have another good effect,\r\nby checking and withdrawing our extensive commerce and navigation (the\r\nfruit of our natural position) within those bounds to which peace must\r\nnecessarily bring them. That this being done by degrees, will probably\r\nprevent those numerous failures produced generally by a peace coming on\r\nsuddenly. Notwithstanding this decree, the sentiments of the merchants\r\nbecome more and more cooled and settled down against arming. Yet it is\r\nbelieved the Representatives do not cool; and though we think the question\r\nagainst arming will be carried, yet probably by a majority of only four or\r\nfive. Their plan is, to have convoys furnished for our vessels going to\r\nEurope, and smaller vessels for the coasting defence. On this condition,\r\nthey will agree to fortify southern harbors, and build some galleys. It\r\nhas been concluded among them, that if war takes place, Wolcott is to be\r\nretained in office, that the President must give up M'Henry, and as to\r\nPickering they are divided, the eastern men being determined to retain\r\nhim, their middle and southern brethren wishing to get rid of him. They\r\nhave talked of General Pinckney as successor to M'Henry. This information\r\nis certain. However, I hope we shall avoid war, and save them the trouble\r\nof a change of ministry. The President has nominated John Quincy Adams\r\nCommissioner Plenipotentiary to renew the treaty with Sweden. Tazewell\r\nmade a great stand against it, on the general ground that we should let\r\nour treaties drop, and remain without any. He could only get eight votes\r\nagainst twenty. A trial will be made to-day in another form, which he\r\nthinks will give ten or eleven against sixteen or seventeen, declaring\r\nthe renewal inexpedient. In this case, notwithstanding the nomination\r\nhas been confirmed, it is supposed the President would perhaps not act\r\nunder it, on the probability that more than the third would be against\r\nthe ratification. I believe, however, that he would act, and that a third\r\ncould not be got to oppose the ratification. It is acknowledged we have\r\nnothing to do but to decide the question about arming. Yet not a word\r\nis said about adjourning; and some even talk of continuing the session\r\npermanently; others talk of July and August. An effort, however, will soon\r\nbe made for an early adjournment.\r\n\r\nMy friendly salutations to Mrs. Madison; to yourself an affectionate adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, March 21, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 15th; since that, yours of the 12th\r\nhas been received. Since that, too, a great change has taken place in\r\nthe appearance of our political atmosphere. The merchants, as before,\r\ncontinue, a respectable part of them, to wish to avoid arming. The\r\nFrench decree operated on them as a sedative, producing more alarm than\r\nresentment; on the Representatives, differently. It excited indignation\r\nhighly in the war party, though I do not know that it had added any new\r\nfriends to that side of the question. We still hoped a majority of about\r\nfour; but the insane message which you will see in the public papers has\r\nhad great effect. Exultation on the one side and a certainty of victory;\r\nwhile the other is petrified with astonishment. Our Evans, though his soul\r\nis wrapt up in the sentiments of this message, yet afraid to give a vote\r\nopenly for it, is going off to-morrow, as is said. Those who count, say\r\nthere are still two members of the other side who will come over to that\r\nof peace. If so, the members will be for war measures, fifty-two, against\r\nthem fifty-three; if all are present except Evans. The question is, what\r\nis to be attempted, supposing we have a majority? I suggest two things:\r\n1. As the President declares he has withdrawn the executive prohibition\r\nto arm, that Congress should pass a legislative one. If that should fail\r\nin the Senate, it would heap coals of fire on their heads. 2. As, to do\r\nnothing and to gain time is everything with us, I propose that they shall\r\ncome to a resolution of adjournment, \"in order to go home and consult\r\ntheir constituents on the great crisis of American affairs now existing.\"\r\nBesides gaining time enough by this, to allow the descent on England to\r\nhave its effect here as well as there, it will be a means of exciting the\r\nwhole body of the people from the state of inattention in which they are;\r\nit will require every member to call for the sense of his district by\r\npetition or instruction; it will show the people with which side of the\r\nHouse their safety as well as their rights rest, by showing them which\r\nis for war and which for peace; and their representatives will return\r\nhere invigorated by the avowed support of the American people. I do not\r\nknow, however, whether this will be approved, as there has been little\r\nconsultation on the subject. We see a new instance of the inefficiency\r\nof constitutional guards. We had relied with great security on that\r\nprovision, which requires two-thirds of the Legislature to declare war.\r\nBut this is completely eluded by a majority's taking such measures as\r\nwill be sure to produce war. I wrote you in my last, that an attempt was\r\nto be made on that day in Senate, to declare the inexpediency of renewing\r\nour treaties. But the measure is put off under the hope of its being\r\nattempted under better auspices. To return to the subject of war, it is\r\nquite impossible, when we consider all the existing circumstances, to find\r\nany reason in its favor resulting from views either of interest or honor,\r\nand plausible enough to impose even on the weakest mind; and especially,\r\nwhen it would be undertaken by a majority of one or two only. Whatever\r\nthen be our stock of charity or liberality, we must resort to other\r\nviews. And those so well known to have been entertained at Annapolis, and\r\nafterwards at the grand convention, by a particular set of men, present\r\nthemselves as those alone which can account for so extraordinary a degree\r\nof impetuosity. Perhaps, instead of what was then in contemplation, a\r\nseparation of the Union, which has been so much the topic to the eastward\r\nof late, may be the thing aimed at. I have written so far, two days before\r\nthe departure of the post. Should anything more occur to-day or to-morrow,\r\nit shall be added. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ----.[9]\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, March 23, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of August\r\n16th and 18th, together with the box of seed accompanying the former,\r\nwhich has just come to hand. The letter of the 4th of June, which you\r\nmention to have committed to Mr. King, has never been received. It has\r\nmost likely been intercepted on the sea, now become a field of lawless and\r\nindiscriminate rapine and violence. The first box which came through Mr.\r\nDonald, arrived safely the last year, but being a little too late for that\r\nseason, its contents have been divided between Mr. Randolph and myself,\r\nand will be committed to the earth now immediately. The peas and the vetch\r\nare most acceptable indeed. Since you were here, I have tried that species\r\nof your field pea which is cultivated in New York, and begin to fear that\r\nthat plant will scarcely bear our sun and soil. A late acquisition too of\r\na species of our country pea, called the cow pea, has pretty well supplied\r\nthe place in my husbandry which I had destined for the European field pea.\r\nIt is very productive, excellent food for man and beast, awaits without\r\nloss our leisure for gathering, and shades the ground very closely through\r\nthe hottest months of the year. This with the loosening of the soil, I\r\ntake to be the chief means by which the pea improves the soil. We know\r\nthat the sun in our cloudless climate is the most powerful destroyer of\r\nfertility in naked ground, and therefore that the perpetual fallows will\r\nnot do here, which are so beneficial in a cloudy climate. Still I shall\r\nwith care try all the several kinds of pea you have been so good as to\r\nsend me, and having tried all hold fast that which is good. Mr. Randolph\r\nis peculiarly happy in having the barleys committed to him, as he had been\r\ndesirous of going considerably into that culture. I was able at the same\r\ntime to put into his hands Siberian barley, sent me from France. I look\r\nforward with considerable anxiety to the success of the winter vetch, for\r\nit gives us a good winter crop, and helps the succeeding summer one. It\r\nis something like doubling the produce of the field. I know it does well\r\nin Italy, and therefore have the more hope here. My experience leaves me\r\nno fear as to the success of clover. I have never seen finer than in some\r\nof my fields which have never been manured. My rotation is triennial; to\r\nwit, one year of wheat and two of clover in the stronger fields, or two of\r\npeas in the weaker, with a crop of Indian corn and potatoes between every\r\nother rotation, that is to say once in seven years. Under this easy course\r\nof culture, aided with some manure, I hope my fields will recover their\r\npristine fertility, which had in some of them been completely exhausted\r\nby perpetual crops of Indian corn and wheat alternately. The atmosphere\r\nis certainly the great workshop of nature for elaborating the fertilizing\r\nprinciples and insinuating them into the soil. It has been relied on\r\nas the sole means of regenerating our soil by most of the land-holders\r\nin the canton I inhabit, and where rest has been resorted to before a\r\ntotal exhaustion, the soil has never failed to recover. If, indeed, it\r\nbe so run down as to be incapable of throwing weeds or herbage of any\r\nkind, to shade the soil from the sun, it either goes off in gullies, and\r\nis entirely lost, or remains exhausted till a growth springs up of such\r\ntrees as will rise in the poorest soils. Under the shade of these and the\r\ncover soon formed of their deciduous leaves, and a commencing herbage,\r\nsuch fields sometimes recover in a long course of years; but this is too\r\nlong to be taken into a course of husbandry. Not so however is the term\r\nwithin which the atmosphere alone will reintegrate a soil rested in due\r\nseason. A year of wheat will be balanced by one, two, or three years of\r\nrest and atmospheric influence, according to the quality of the soil. It\r\nhas been said that no rotation of crops will keep the earth in the same\r\ndegree of fertility without the aid of manure. But it is well known here\r\nthat a space of rest greater or less in spontaneous herbage, will restore\r\nthe exhaustion of a single crop. This then is a rotation; and as it is\r\nnot to be believed that spontaneous herbage is the only or best covering\r\nduring rest, so may we expect that a substitute for it may be found which\r\nwill yield profitable crops. Such perhaps are clover, peas, vetches, &c.\r\nA rotation then may be found, which by giving time for the slow influence\r\nof the atmosphere, will keep the soil in a constant and equal state of\r\nfertility. But the advantage of manuring, is that it will do more in one\r\nthan the atmosphere would require several years to do, and consequently\r\nenables you so much the oftener to take exhausting crops from the soil, a\r\ncircumstance of importance where there is more labor than land. I am much\r\nindebted.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [9] [Address lost.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PATTERSON.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, March 27, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In the lifetime of Mr. Rittenhouse, I communicated to him the\r\ndescription of a mould-board of a plough which I had constructed, and\r\nsupposed to be what we might term the _mould-board of least resistance_.\r\nI asked not only his opinion, but that he would submit it to you also.\r\nAfter he had considered it, he gave me his own opinion that it was\r\ndemonstrably what I had supposed, and I think he said he had communicated\r\nit to you. Of that however I am not sure, and therefore now take the\r\nliberty of sending you a description of it and a model, which I have\r\nprepared for the board of Agriculture of England at their request. Mr.\r\nStrickland, one of their members, had seen the model, and also the thing\r\nitself in use in my farms, and thinking favorably of it, had mentioned it\r\nto them. My purpose in troubling you with it, is to ask the favor of you\r\nto examine the description rigorously, and suggest to me any corrections\r\nor alterations which you may think necessary, and would wish to have the\r\nideas go as correct as possible out of my hands. I had sometimes thought\r\nof giving it into the Philosophical Society, but I doubted whether it\r\nwas worth their notice, and supposed it not exactly in the line of their\r\nordinary publications. I had therefore contemplated the sending it to some\r\nof our agricultural societies, in whose way it was more particularly, when\r\nI received the request of the English board. The papers I enclose you\r\nare the latter part of a letter to Sir John Sinclair, their president.\r\nIt is to go off by the packet, wherefore I will ask the favor of you to\r\nreturn them with the model in the course of the present week, with any\r\nobservations you will be so good as to favor me with. I am with great\r\nesteem, Dear Sir, your most obedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, March 29, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 21st. Yours of the 12th, therein\r\nacknowledged, is the last received. The measure I suggested in mine,\r\nof adjourning for consultation with their constituents, was not brought\r\nforward; but on Tuesday three resolutions were moved, which you will see\r\nin the public papers. They were offered in committee, to prevent their\r\nbeing suppressed by the previous question, and in the committee on the\r\nstate of the Union, to put it out of their power, by the rising of the\r\ncommittee and not sitting again, to get rid of them. They were taken by\r\nsurprise, not expecting to be called to vote on such a proposition as\r\n\"that it is inexpedient to resort to war against the French republic.\"\r\nAfter spending the first day in seeking on every side some hole to get\r\nout at, like an animal first put into a cage, they gave up their resource.\r\nYesterday they came forward boldly, and openly combated the proposition.\r\nMr. Harper and Mr. Pinckney pronounced bitter philippics against France,\r\nselecting such circumstances and aggravations as to give the worst picture\r\nthey could present. The latter, on this, as in the affair of Lyon and\r\nGriswold, went far beyond that moderation he has on other occasions\r\nrecommended. We know not how it will go. Some think the resolution will\r\nbe lost, some, that it will be carried; but neither way, by a majority\r\nof more than one or two. The decision of the Executive, of two-thirds of\r\nthe Senate, and half the House of Representatives, is too much for the\r\nother half of that House. We therefore fear it will be borne down, and\r\nare under the most gloomy apprehensions. In fact, the question of war and\r\npeace depends now on a toss of cross and pile. If we could but gain this\r\nseason, we should be saved. The affairs of Europe would of themselves save\r\nus. Besides this, there can be no doubt that a revolution of opinion in\r\nMassachusetts and Connecticut is working. Two whig presses have been set\r\nup in each of those States. There has been for some days a rumor, that\r\na treaty of alliance, offensive and defensive with Great Britain, has\r\narrived. Some circumstances have occasioned it to be listened to; to wit,\r\nthe arrival of Mr. King's secretary, which is affirmed, the departure of\r\nMr. Liston's secretary, which I know is to take place on Wednesday next,\r\nthe high tone of the executive measures at the last and present session,\r\ncalculated to raise things to the unison of such a compact, and supported\r\nso desperately in both Houses in opposition to the pacific wishes of the\r\npeople, and at the risk of their approbation at the ensuing election.\r\nLangdon yesterday, in debate, mentioned this current report. Tracy, in\r\nreply, declared he knew of no such thing, did not believe it, nor would be\r\nits advocate.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to get the Quakers to come forward with a\r\npetition, to aid with the weight of their body the feeble band of peace.\r\nThey have, with some effort, got a petition signed by a few of their\r\nsociety; the main body of their society refuse it. M'Lay's peace motion in\r\nthe Assembly of Pennsylvania was rejected with an unanimity of the Quaker\r\nvote, and it seems to be well understood, that their attachment to England\r\nis stronger than to their principles or their country. The revolution\r\nwar was a first proof of this. Mr. White, from the federal city, is here,\r\nsoliciting money for the buildings at Washington. A bill for two hundred\r\nthousand dollars has passed the House of Representatives, and is before\r\nthe Senate, where its fate is entirely uncertain. He has become perfectly\r\nsatisfied that Mr. Adams is radically against the government's being\r\nthere. Goodhue (his oracle) openly said in committee, in presence of\r\nWhite, that he knew the government was obliged to go there, but they would\r\nnot be obliged to stay there. Mr. Adams said to White, that it would be\r\nbetter that the President should rent a common house there, to live in;\r\nthat no President would live in the one now building. This harmonizes with\r\nGoodhue's idea of a short residence. I wrote this in the morning, but need\r\nnot part with it till night. If anything occurs in the day it shall be\r\nadded. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PENDLETON.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, April 2, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of January\r\n29th, and as the rising of Congress seems now to be contemplated for\r\nabout the last of this month, and it is necessary that I settle Mr.\r\nShort's matter with the Treasury before my departure, I take the liberty\r\nof saying a word on that subject. The sum you are to pay is to go to\r\nthe credit of a demand which Mr. Short has on the treasury of the United\r\nStates, and for which they consider Mr. Randolph as liable to them, so\r\nthat the sum he pays to Short directly lessens so much the balance to be\r\notherwise settled. Mr. Short, by a letter received a few days ago, has\r\ndirected an immediate employment of the whole sum in a particular way.\r\nI wish your sum settled, therefore, that I may call on the Treasury for\r\nthe exact balance. I should have thought your best market for stock would\r\nhave been here, and, I am convinced, the quicker sold the better; for,\r\nshould the war measures recommended by the Executive, and taken up by the\r\nLegislature, be carried through, the fall of stock will be very sudden,\r\nwar being then more than probable. Mr. Short holds some stock here, and,\r\nshould the first of Mr. Sprigg's resolutions, now under debate in the\r\nlower house, be rejected, I shall, within 24 hours from the rejection,\r\nsell out the whole of Mr. Short's stock. How that resolution will be\r\ndisposed of (to wit, that against the expediency of war with the French\r\nRepublic), is very doubtful. Those who count votes vary the issue from a\r\nmajority of 4 against the resolution to 2 or 3 majority in its favor. So\r\nthat the scales of peace and war are very nearly in equilibrio. Should\r\nthe debate hold many days, we shall derive aid from the delay. Letters\r\nreceived from France by a vessel just arrived, concur in assuring us,\r\nthat, as all the French measures bear equally on the Swedes and Danes\r\nas on us, so they have no more purpose of declaring war against us than\r\nagainst them. Besides this, a wonderful stir is commencing in the eastern\r\nStates. The dirty business of Lyon and Griswold was of a nature to fly\r\nthrough the newspapers, both Whig and Tory, and to excite the attention of\r\nall classes. It, of course, carried to their attention, at the same time,\r\nthe debates out of which that affair springs. The subject of these debates\r\nwas, whether the representatives of the people were to have no check on\r\nthe expenditure of the public money, and the Executive to squander it at\r\ntheir will, leaving to the Legislature only the drudgery of furnishing\r\nthe money. They begin to open their eyes on this to the eastward, and\r\nto suspect they have been hoodwinked. Two or three Whig presses have\r\nset up in Massachusetts, and as many more in Connecticut. The late war\r\nmessage of the President has added new alarm. Town meetings have begun\r\nin Massachusetts, and are sending on their petitions and remonstrances\r\nby great majorities, against war measures, and these meetings are likely\r\nto spread. The present debate, as it gets abroad, will further show\r\nthem, that it is their members who are for war measures. It happens,\r\nfortunately, that these gentlemen are obliged to bring themselves forward\r\nexactly in time for the eastern elections to Congress, which come on in\r\nthe course of the ensuing summer. We have, therefore, great reason to\r\nexpect some favorable changes in the representatives from that quarter.\r\nThe same is counted on with confidence from Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\r\nMaryland; perhaps one or two also in Virginia; so that, after the next\r\nelection, the Whigs think themselves certain of a very strong majority in\r\nthe House of Representatives; and though against the other branches they\r\ncan do nothing good, yet they can hinder them from doing ill. The only\r\nsource of anxiety, therefore, is to avoid war for the present moment.\r\nIf we can defeat the measures leading to that during this session, so as\r\nto gain this summer, time will be given, as well for the public mind to\r\nmake itself felt, as for the operations of France to have their effect in\r\nEngland as well as here. If, on the contrary, war is forced on, the Tory\r\ninterest continues dominant, and to them alone must be left, as they alone\r\ndesire to ride on the whirlwind, and direct the storm. The present period,\r\ntherefore, of two or three weeks, is the most eventful ever known since\r\nthat of 1775, and will decide whether the principles established by that\r\ncontest are to prevail, or give way to those they subverted. Accept the\r\nfriendly salutations and prayers for your health and happiness, of, dear\r\nSir, your sincere and affectionate friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, April 5, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 29th ultimo; since which I have no\r\nletter from you. These acknowledgments regularly made and attended to,\r\nwill show whether any of my letters are intercepted, and the impression of\r\nmy seal on wax (which shall be constant hereafter) will discover whether\r\nthey are opened by the way. The nature of some of my communications\r\nfurnishes ground of inquietude for their safe conveyance. The bill for\r\nthe federal buildings labors hard in Senate, though, to lessen opposition,\r\nthe Maryland Senator himself proposed to reduce the two hundred thousand\r\ndollars to one-third of that sum. Sedgewick and Hillhouse violently oppose\r\nit. I conjecture that the votes will be either thirteen for and fifteen\r\nagainst it, or fourteen and fourteen. Every member declares he means to\r\ngo there, but though charged with an intention to come away again, not\r\none of them disavow it. This will engender incurable distrust. The debate\r\non Mr. Sprigg's resolutions has been interrupted by a motion to call\r\nfor papers. This was carried by a great majority. In this case, there\r\nappeared a separate squad, to wit, the Pinckney interest, which is a\r\ndistinct thing, and will be seen sometimes to lurch the President. It is\r\nin truth the Hamilton party, whereof Pinckney is only made the stalking\r\nhorse. The papers have been sent in and read, and it is now under debate\r\nin both Houses, whether they shall be published. I write in the morning,\r\nand if determined in the course of the day in favor of publication, I\r\nwill add in the evening a general idea of their character. Private letters\r\nfrom France, by a late vessel which sailed from Havre, February the 5th,\r\nassure us that France, classing us in her measures with the Swedes and\r\nDanes, has no more notion of declaring war against us than them. You will\r\nsee a letter in Bache's paper of yesterday, which came addressed to me.\r\nStill the fate of Sprigg's resolutions seems in perfect equilibrio. You\r\nwill see in Fenno two numbers of a paper signed Marcellus. They promise\r\nmuch mischief, and are ascribed, without any difference of opinion, to\r\nHamilton. You must, my dear Sir, take up your pen against this champion.\r\nYou know the ingenuity of his talents; and there is not a person but\r\nyourself who can foil him. For heaven's sake, then, take up your pen, and\r\ndo not desert the public cause altogether.\r\n\r\nThursday evening. The Senate have, to-day, voted the publication of the\r\ncommunications from our Envoys. The House of Representatives decided\r\nagainst the publication by a majority of seventy-five to twenty-four. The\r\nSenate adjourned, over to-morrow (good Friday), to Saturday morning; but\r\nas the papers cannot be printed within that time, perhaps the vote of the\r\nHouse of Representatives may induce the Senate to reconsider theirs. For\r\nthis reason, I think it my duty to be silent on them. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, April 6, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--So much of the communications from our Envoys has got abroad,\r\nand so partially, that there can now be no ground for reconsideration\r\nwith the Senate. I may therefore, consistently with duty, do what every\r\nmember of the body is doing. Still, I would rather you would use the\r\ncommunication with reserve till you see the whole papers. The first\r\nimpressions from them are very disagreeable and confused. Reflection,\r\nhowever, and analysis resolve them into this. Mr. Adams' speech to\r\nCongress in May is deemed such a national affront, that no explanation\r\non other topics can be entered on till that, as a preliminary, is wiped\r\naway by humiliating disavowals or acknowledgments. This working hard with\r\nour Envoys, and indeed seeming impracticable for want of that sort of\r\nauthority, submission to a heavy amendment (upwards of a million sterling)\r\nwas, at an after meeting, suggested as an alternative, which might be\r\nadmitted if proposed by us. These overtures had been through informal\r\nagents; and both the alternatives bringing the Envoys to their _ne plus_,\r\nthey resolve to have no more communication through inofficial characters,\r\nbut to address a letter directly to the government, to bring forward\r\ntheir pretensions. This letter had not yet, however, been prepared.\r\nThere were, interwoven with these overtures some base propositions on\r\nthe part of Talleyrand, through one of his agents, to sell his interest\r\nand influence with the Directory towards soothing difficulties with\r\nthem, in consideration of a large sum (fifty thousand pounds sterling);\r\nand the arguments to which his agent resorted to induce compliance\r\nwith this demand, were very unworthy of a great nation, (could they be\r\nimputed to them,) and calculated to excite disgust and indignation in\r\nAmericans generally, and alienation in the republicans particularly,\r\nwhom they so far mistake, as to presume an attachment to France and\r\nhatred to the federal party, and not the love of their country, to be\r\ntheir first passion. No difficulty was expressed towards an adjustment of\r\nall differences and misunderstandings, or even ultimately a payment for\r\nspoliations, if the insult from our Executive should be first wiped away.\r\nObserve, that I state all this from only a single hearing of the papers,\r\nand therefore it may not be rigorously correct. The little slanderous\r\nimputation before mentioned, has been the bait which hurried the opposite\r\nparty into this publication. The first impressions with the people will\r\nbe disagreeable, but the last and permanent one will be, that the speech\r\nin May is now the only obstacle to accommodation, and the real cause of\r\nwar, if war takes place. And how much will be added to this by the speech\r\nof November, is yet to be learned. It is evident, however, on reflection,\r\nthat these papers do not offer one motive the more for our going to war.\r\nYet such is their effect on the minds of wavering characters, that I fear,\r\nthat to wipe off the imputation of being French partisans, they will go\r\nover to the war measures so furiously pushed by the other party. It seems,\r\nindeed, as if they were afraid they should not be able to get into war\r\ntill Great Britain shall be blown up, and the prudence of our countrymen\r\nfrom that circumstance, have influence enough to prevent it. The most\r\nartful misrepresentations of the contents of these papers were published\r\nyesterday, and produced such a shock in the republican mind, as had never\r\nbeen seen since our independence. We are to dread the effects of this\r\ndismay till their fuller information. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, April 12, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you two letters on the 5th and 6th instant; since which\r\nI have received yours of the 2d. I send you, in a separate package, the\r\ninstructions to our Envoys and their communications. You will find that my\r\nrepresentation of their contents from memory, was substantially just. The\r\npublic mind appears still in a state of astonishment. There never was a\r\nmoment in which the aid of an able pen was so important to place things in\r\ntheir just attitude. On this depend the inchoate movement in the eastern\r\nmind, and the fate of the elections in that quarter, now beginning and\r\nto continue through the summer. I would not propose to you such a task\r\non any ordinary occasion. But be assured that a well-digested analysis of\r\nthese papers would now decide the future turn of things, which are at this\r\nmoment on the creen. The merchants here are meeting under the auspices\r\nof Fitzsimmons, to address the President and approve his propositions.\r\nNothing will be spared on that side. Sprigg's first resolution against\r\nthe expediency of war, proper at the time it was moved, is now postponed\r\nas improper, because to declare that, after we have understood it has\r\nbeen proposed to us to try peace, would imply an acquiescence under\r\nthat proposition. All, therefore, which the advocates of peace can now\r\nattempt, is to prevent war measures _externally_, consenting to every\r\nrational measure of _internal_ defence and preparation. Great expenses\r\nwill be incurred; and it will be left to those whose measures render\r\nthem necessary, to provide to meet them. They already talk of stopping\r\nall payments of interest, and of a land tax. These will probably not be\r\nopposed. The only question will be, how to modify the land tax. On this\r\nthere may be a great diversity of sentiment. One party will want to make\r\nit a new source of patronage and expense. If this business is taken up,\r\nit will lengthen our session. We had pretty generally, till now, fixed on\r\nthe beginning of May for adjournment. I shall return by my usual routes,\r\nand not by the eastern shore, on account of the advance of the season.\r\nFriendly salutations to Mrs. Madison and yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. CARR.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, April 12, 1798.\r\n\r\nAs the instruction to our Envoys and their communications have excited a\r\ngreat deal of curiosity, I enclose you a copy. You will perceive that they\r\nhave been assailed by swindlers, whether with or without the participation\r\nof Talleyrand is not very apparent. The known corruption of his character\r\nrenders it very possible he may have intended to share largely in the\r\n£50,000 demanded. But that the Directory know anything of it is neither\r\nproved nor probable. On the contrary, when the Portuguese ambassador\r\nyielded to like attempts of swindlers, the conduct of the Directory in\r\nimprisoning him for an attempt at corruption, as well as their general\r\nconduct really magnanimous, places them above suspicion. It is pretty\r\nevident that Mr. A.'s speech is in truth the only obstacle to negotiation.\r\nThat humiliating disavowals of that are demanded as a preliminary, or as\r\na commutation for that a heavy sum of money, about a million sterling.\r\nThis obstacle removed, they seem not to object to an arrangement of\r\nall differences, and even to settle and acknowledge themselves debtors\r\nfor spoliations. Nor does it seem that negotiation is at an end, as\r\nthe President's message says, but that it is in its commencement only.\r\nThe instructions comply with the wishes expressed in debate in the May\r\nsession to place France on as good footing as England, and not to make a\r\n_sine qua non_ of the indemnification for spoliation; but they declare\r\nthe war in which France is engaged is not a defensive one, they reject\r\nthe naturalization of French ships, that is to say the exchange of\r\nnaturalization which France had formerly proposed to us, and which would\r\nlay open to us the unrestrained trade of her West Indies and all her\r\nother possessions; they declare the 10th article of the British treaty,\r\nagainst sequestering debts, money in the funds, bank stock, &c., to be\r\nfounded in morality, and therefore of perpetual obligation, and some other\r\nheterodoxies.\r\n\r\nYou will have seen in the newspapers some resolutions proposed by Mr.\r\nSprigg, the first of which was, that it was inexpedient under existing\r\ncircumstances to resort to war with France. Whether this could have been\r\ncarried before is doubtful, but since it is known that a sum of money\r\nhas been demanded, it is thought that this resolution, were it now to be\r\npassed, would imply a willingness to avoid war even by purchasing peace.\r\nIt is therefore postponed. The peace party will agree to all reasonable\r\nmeasures of internal defence, but oppose all external preparations. Though\r\nit is evident that these communications do not present one motive the more\r\nfor going to war, yet it may be doubted whether we are strong enough to\r\nkeep within the defensive line. It is thought the expenses contemplated\r\nwill render a land tax necessary before we separate. If so, it will\r\nlengthen the session. The first impressions from these communications\r\nare disagreeable; but their ultimate effect on the public mind will not\r\nbe favorable to the war party. They may have some effect in the first\r\nmoment in stopping the movement in the Eastern States, which were on the\r\ncreen, and were running into town meetings, yet it is believed this will\r\nbe momentary only, and will be over before their elections. Considerable\r\nexpectations were formed of changes in the Eastern delegations favorable\r\nto the Whig interest. Present my best respects to Mrs. Carr, and accept\r\nyourself assurance of affectionate esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, April 26, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bill for the naval armament (twelve vessels) passed by a majority of\r\nabout four to three in the House of Representatives; all restrictions\r\non the objects for which the vessels should be used were struck out.\r\nThe bill for establishing a department of Secretary of the Navy was\r\ntried yesterday, on its passage to the third reading, and prevailed by\r\nforty-seven against forty-one. It will be read the third time to-day.\r\nThe provisional army of twenty-thousand men will meet some difficulty.\r\nIt would surely be rejected if our members were all here. Giles, Clopton,\r\nCabell and Nicholas have gone, and Clay goes to-morrow. He received here\r\nnews of the death of his wife. Parker has completely gone over to the\r\nwar party. In this state of things they will carry what they please.\r\nOne of the war party, in a fit of unguarded passion, declared sometime\r\nago they would pass a citizen bill, an alien bill, and a sedition bill;\r\naccordingly, some days ago, Coit laid a motion on the table of the House\r\nof Representatives for modifying the citizen law. Their threats pointed\r\nat Gallatin, and it is believed they will endeavor to reach him by this\r\nbill. Yesterday Mr. Hillhouse laid on the table of the Senate a motion\r\nfor giving power to send away suspected aliens. This is understood to be\r\nmeant for Volney and Collot. But it will not stop there when it gets into\r\na course of execution. There is now only wanting, to accomplish the whole\r\ndeclaration before mentioned, a sedition bill, which we shall certainly\r\nsoon see proposed. The object of that, is the suppression of the Whig\r\npresses. Bache's has been particularly named. That paper and also Carey's\r\ntotter for want of subscriptions. We should really exert ourselves to\r\nprocure them, for if these papers fall, republicanism will be entirely\r\nbrow beaten. Carey's paper comes out three times a week, at five dollars.\r\nThe meeting of the people which was called at New York, did nothing. It\r\nwas found that the majority would be against the address. They therefore\r\nchose to circulate it individually. The committee of Ways and Means have\r\nvoted a land tax. An additional tax on salt will certainly be proposed in\r\nthe House, and probably prevail to some degree. The stoppage of interest\r\non the public debt will also, perhaps, be proposed, but not with effect.\r\nIn the meantime, that paper cannot be sold. Hamilton is coming on as\r\nSenator from New York. There have been so much contrivance and combination\r\nin that, as to show there is some great object in hand. Troup, the\r\ndistrict judge of New York, resigns towards the close of the session of\r\ntheir Assembly. The appointment of Mr. Hobart, then Senator, to succeed\r\nTroup, is not made by the President till after the Assembly had risen.\r\nOtherwise, they would have chosen the Senator in place of Hobart. Jay then\r\nnames Hamilton, Senator, but not till a day or two before his own election\r\nas Governor was to come on, lest the unpopularity of the nomination should\r\nbe in time to effect his own election. We shall see in what all this is to\r\nend; but surely in something. The popular movement in the eastern States\r\nis checked, as we expected, and war addresses are showering in from New\r\nJersey and the great trading towns. However, we still trust that a nearer\r\nview of war and a land tax will oblige the great mass of the people to\r\nattend. At present, the war hawks talk of septembrizing, deportation, and\r\nthe examples for quelling sedition set by the French executive. All the\r\nfirmness of the human mind is now in a state of requisition.\r\n\r\nSalutations to Mrs. Madison; and to yourself, friendship and adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                 PHILADELPHIA, May 3, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 26th; since which yours of the 22d\r\nof April has been received, acknowledging mine of the 12th; so that\r\nall appear to have been received to that date. The spirit kindled up\r\nin the towns is wonderful. These and New Jersey are pouring in their\r\naddresses, offering life and fortune. Even these addresses are not the\r\nworst things. For indiscreet declarations and expressions of passion\r\nmay be pardoned to a multitude acting from the impulse of the moment.\r\nBut we cannot expect a foreign nation to show that apathy to the answers\r\nof the President, which are more thrasonic than the addresses. Whatever\r\nchance for peace might have been left us after the publication of the\r\ndespatches, is completely lost by these answers. Nor is it France alone,\r\nbut his own fellow citizens, against whom his threats are uttered. In\r\nFenno, of yesterday, you will see one, wherein he says to the address from\r\nNewark, \"the delusions and misrepresentations which have misled so many\r\ncitizens, must be discountenanced by authority as well as by the citizens\r\nat large;\" evidently alluding to those letters from the Representatives\r\nto their constituents, which they have been in the habit of seeking after\r\nand publishing; while those sent by the Tory part of the House to their\r\nconstituents, are ten times more numerous, and replete with the most\r\natrocious falsehoods and calumnies. What new law they will propose on\r\nthis subject, has not yet leaked out. The citizen bill sleeps. The alien\r\nbill, proposed by the Senate, has not yet been brought in. That proposed\r\nby the House of Representatives has been so moderated, that it will not\r\nanswer the passionate purposes of the war gentlemen. Whether, therefore,\r\nthe Senate will push their bolder plan, I know not. The provisional army\r\ndoes not go down so smoothly in the House as it did in the Senate. They\r\nare whitling away some of its choice ingredients; particularly that of\r\ntransferring their own constitutional discretion over the raising of\r\narmies to the President. A committee of the Representatives have struck\r\nout his discretion, and hang the raising of the men on the contingencies\r\nof invasion, insurrection, or declaration of war. Were all our members\r\nhere, the bill would not pass. But it will, probably, as the House now\r\nis. Its expense is differently estimated, from five to eight millions of\r\ndollars a year. Their purposes before voted, require two millions above\r\nall the other taxes, which, therefore, are voted to be raised on lands,\r\nhouses and slaves. The provisional army will be additional to this. The\r\nthreatening appearances from the alien bills have so alarmed the French\r\nwho are among us, that they are going off. A ship, chartered by themselves\r\nfor this purpose, will sail within about a fortnight for France, with as\r\nmany as she can carry. Among these I believe will be Volney, who has in\r\ntruth been the principal object aimed at by the law.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the unfavorableness of the late impressions, it is\r\nbelieved the New York elections, which are over, will give us two or\r\nthree republicans more than we now have. But it is supposed Jay is\r\nre-elected. It is said Hamilton declines coming to the Senate. He very\r\nsoon stopped his Marcellus. It was rather the sequel which was feared\r\nthan what actually appeared. He comes out on a different plan in his Titus\r\nManlius, if that be really his. The appointments to the Mississippi were\r\nso abominable that the Senate could not swallow them. They referred them\r\nto a committee to inquire into characters, and the President withdrew the\r\nnomination. * * * * *\r\n\r\nAs there is nothing material now to be proposed, we generally expect to\r\nrise in about three weeks. However, I do not venture to order my horses.\r\n\r\nMy respectful salutations to Mrs. Madison. To yourself affectionate\r\nfriendship, and adieu.\r\n\r\nP. S. Perhaps the President's expression before quoted, may look to the\r\nsedition bill which has been spoken of, and which may be meant to put the\r\nprinting presses under the _imprimatur_ of the executive. Bache is thought\r\na main object of it. Cabot, of Massachusetts, is appointed Secretary of\r\nthe Navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES LEWIS, JUNIOR.\r\n\r\n                                                 PHILADELPHIA, May 9, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am much obliged by your friendly letter of the 4th instant.\r\nAs soon as I saw the first of Mr. Martin's letters, I turned to the\r\nnewspapers of the day, and found Logan's speech, as translated by a common\r\nIndian interpreter. The version I had used, had been made by General\r\nGibson. Finding from Mr. Martin's style, that his object was not merely\r\ntruth, but to gratify party passions, I never read another of his letters.\r\nI determined to do my duty by searching into the truth, and publishing it\r\nto the world, whatever it should be. This I shall do at a proper season.\r\nI am much indebted to many persons, who, without any acquaintance with\r\nme, have voluntarily sent me information on the subject. Party passions\r\nare indeed high. Nobody has more reason to know it than myself. I receive\r\ndaily bitter proofs of it from people who never saw me, nor know anything\r\nof me but through Porcupine and Fenno. At this moment all the passions are\r\nboiling over, and one who keeps himself cool and clear of the contagion,\r\nis so far below the point of ordinary conversation, that he finds himself\r\ninsulated in every society. However, the fever will not last. War,\r\nland tax and stamp tax, are sedatives which must cool its ardor. They\r\nwill bring on reflection, and that, with information, is all which our\r\ncountrymen need, to bring themselves and their affairs to rights. They\r\nare essentially republicans. They retain unadulterated the principles of\r\n'75, and those who are conscious of no change in themselves have nothing\r\nto fear in the long run. It is our duty still to endeavor to avoid war;\r\nbut if it shall actually take place, no matter by whom brought on, we must\r\ndefend ourselves. If our house be on fire, without inquiring whether it\r\nwas fired from within or without, we must try to extinguish it. In that,\r\nI have no doubt, we shall act as one man. But if we can ward off actual\r\nwar till the crisis of England is over, I shall hope we may escape it\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nI am, with much esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, May 21, 1798.\r\n\r\nYours of April 8th and 14th, and May 4th and 14th, have been received\r\nin due time. I have not written to you since the 19th ult., because I\r\nknew you would be out on a circuit, and would receive the letters only\r\nwhen they would be as old almanacs. The bill for the provisional army\r\nhas got through the lower House, the regulars reduced to 10,000, and\r\nthe volunteers unlimited. It was carried by a majority of 14. The land\r\ntax is now on the carpet to raise two millions of dollars; yet I think\r\nthey must at least double it, as the expenses of the provisional army\r\nwere not provided for in it, and will require of itself four millions\r\na year. I presume, therefore, the tax on lands, houses, and negroes,\r\nwill be a dollar a head on the population of each State. There are alien\r\nbills, sedition bills, &c., also before both Houses. The severity of\r\ntheir aspect determines a great number of French to go off. A ship-load\r\nsails on Monday next; among them Volney. If no new business is brought\r\non, I think they may get through the tax bill in three weeks. You will\r\nhave seen, among numerous addresses and answers, one from Lancaster in\r\nthis State, and its answer. The latter travelling out of the topics of\r\nthe address altogether, to mention you in a most injurious manner. Your\r\nfeelings have no doubt been much implicated by it, as in truth it had all\r\nthe characters necessary to produce irritation. What notice you should\r\ntake of it is difficult to say. But there is one step in which two or\r\nthree with whom I have spoken concur with me, that feeble as the hand is\r\nfrom which this shaft is thrown, yet with a great mass of our citizens,\r\nstrangers to the leading traits of the character from which it came, it\r\nwill have considerable effect; and that in order to replace yourself on\r\nthe high ground you are entitled to, it is absolutely necessary that you\r\nshould re-appear on the public theatre, and take an independent stand,\r\nfrom which you can be seen and known to your fellow citizens. The House of\r\nRepresentatives appears the only place which can answer this end, as the\r\nproceedings of the other House are too obscure. Cabell has said he would\r\ngive way to you, should you choose to come in, and I really think it would\r\nbe expedient for yourself as well as the public, that you should not wait\r\nuntil another election, but come to the next session. No interval should\r\nbe admitted between this last attack of enmity and your re-appearance with\r\nthe approving voice of your constituents, and your taking a commanding\r\nattitude. I have not before been anxious for your return to public life,\r\nlest it should interfere with a proper pursuit of your private interests,\r\nbut the next session will not at all interfere with your courts, because\r\nit must end March 4th, and I verily believe the next election will give\r\nus such a majority in the House of Representatives as to enable the\r\nrepublican party to shorten the alternate unlimited session, as it is\r\nevident that to shorten the sessions is to lessen the evils and burthens\r\nof the government on our country. The present session has already cost\r\n200,000 dollars, besides the wounds it has inflicted on the prosperity of\r\nthe Union. I have no doubt Cabell can be induced to retire immediately,\r\nand that a writ may be issued at once. The very idea of this will strike\r\nthe public mind, and raise its confidence in you. If this be done, I\r\nshould think it best you should take no notice at all of the answer to\r\nLancaster. Because, were you to show a personal hostility against the\r\nanswer, it would deaden the effect of everything you should say or do in\r\nyour public place hereafter. All would be ascribed to an enmity to Mr. A.,\r\nand you know with what facility such insinuations enter the minds of men.\r\nI have not seen Dawson since this answer has appeared, and therefore have\r\nnot yet learnt his sentiments on it. My respectful salutations to Mrs.\r\nMonroe; and to yourself, affectionately adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, May 31, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote to you last on the 24th, since which yours of the 20th\r\nhas been received. I must begin by correcting two errors in my last. It\r\nwas false arithmetic to say, that two measures therein mentioned to have\r\nbeen carried by majorities of eleven, would have failed if the fourteen\r\nabsentees (wherein a majority of six is ours) had been present. Six coming\r\nover from the other side would have turned the scale, and this was the\r\nidea floating in my mind, which produced the mistake. The second error was\r\nin the version of Mr. Adams' expression, which I stated to you. His real\r\nexpression was \"that he would not unbrace a single nerve for any treaty\r\nFrance could offer; such was their entire want of faith, morality, &c.\"\r\n\r\nThe bill from the Senate for capturing French armed vessels found\r\nhovering on our coast was passed in two days by the lower House, without\r\na single alteration; and the Ganges, a twenty gun sloop, fell down the\r\nriver instantly to go on a cruise. She has since been ordered to New\r\nYork, to convoy a vessel from that to this port. The alien bill will be\r\nready to day, probably, for its third reading in the Senate. It has been\r\nconsiderably mollified, particularly by a proviso saving the rights of\r\ntreaties. Still, it is a most detestable thing. I was glad, in yesterday's\r\ndiscussion, to hear it admitted on all hands, that laws of the United\r\nStates, subsequent to a treaty, control its operation, and that the\r\nLegislature is the only power which can control a treaty. Both points\r\nare sound beyond doubt. This bill will unquestionably pass the House of\r\nRepresentatives, the majority there being very decisive, consolidated,\r\nand bold enough to do anything. I have no doubt from the hints dropped,\r\nthey will pass a bill to declare the French treaty void. I question if\r\nthey will think a declaration of war prudent, as it might alarm, and\r\nall its effects are answered by the act authorizing captures. A bill is\r\nbrought in for suspending all communication with the dominions of France,\r\nwhich will no doubt pass. It is suspected that they mean to borrow money\r\nof individuals in London, on the credit of our land tax, and perhaps the\r\nguarantee of Great Britain. The land tax was yesterday debated, and a\r\nmajority of six struck out the thirteenth section of the classification\r\nof houses, and taxed them by a different scale from the lands. Instead\r\nof this, is to be proposed a valuation of the houses and lands together.\r\nMacon yesterday laid a motion on the table for adjourning on the 14th.\r\nSome think they do not mean to adjourn; others, that they wait first the\r\nreturn of the Envoys, for whom it is now avowed the brig Sophia was sent.\r\nIt is expected she would bring them off about the middle of this month.\r\nThey may, therefore, be expected here about the second week of July.\r\nWhatever be their decision as to adjournment I think it probable my next\r\nletter will convey orders for my horses, and that I shall leave this place\r\nfrom the 20th to the 25th of June; for I have no expectation they will\r\nactually adjourn sooner. Volney and a ship-load of others sail on Sunday\r\nnext. Another ship-load will go off in about three weeks. It is natural\r\nto expect they go under irritations calculated to fan the flame. Not so\r\nVolney. He is most thoroughly impressed with the importance of preventing\r\nwar, whether considered with reference to the interests of the two\r\ncountries, of the cause of republicanism, or of man on the broad scale.\r\nBut an eagerness to render this prevention impossible, leaves me without\r\nany hope. Some of those who have insisted that it was long since war on\r\nthe part of France, are candid enough to admit that it is now begun on our\r\npart also. I enclose for your perusal a poem on the alien bill, written by\r\nMr. Marshall. I do this, as well for your amusement, as to get you to take\r\ncare of this copy for me till I return; for it will be lost in lending\r\nit, if I retain it here, as the publication was suppressed after the sale\r\nof a few copies, of which I was fortunate enough to get one. Your locks,\r\nhinges, &c., shall be immediately attended to.\r\n\r\nMy respectful salutations and friendship to Mrs. Madison, to the family,\r\nand to yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\nP. S. The President, it is said, has refused an Exequatur to the consul\r\ngeneral of France, Dupont.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, June 1, 1798.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. New showed me your letter on the subject of the patent, which gave\r\nme an opportunity of observing what you said as to the effect, with\r\nyou, of public proceedings, and that it was not unwise now to estimate\r\nthe separate mass of Virginia and North Carolina, with a view to their\r\nseparate existence. It is true that we are completely under the saddle\r\nof Massachusetts and Connecticut, and that they ride us very hard,\r\ncruelly insulting our feelings, as well as exhausting our strength and\r\nsubsistence. Their natural friends, the three other eastern States,\r\njoin them from a sort of family pride, and they have the art to divide\r\ncertain other parts of the Union, so as to make use of them to govern\r\nthe whole. This is not new, it is the old practice of despots; to use\r\na part of the people to keep the rest in order. And those who have once\r\ngot an ascendancy, and possessed themselves of all the resources of the\r\nnation, their revenues and offices, have immense means for retaining\r\ntheir advantage. But our present situation is not a natural one. The\r\nrepublicans, through every part of the Union, say, that it was the\r\nirresistible influence and popularity of General Washington played\r\noff by the cunning of Hamilton, which turned the government over to\r\nanti-republican hands, or turned the republicans chosen by the people into\r\nanti-republicans. He delivered it over to his successor in this state, and\r\nvery untoward events since, improved with great artifice, have produced\r\non the public mind the impressions we see. But still I repeat it, this\r\nis not the natural state. Time alone would bring round an order of things\r\nmore correspondent to the sentiments of our constituents. But are there no\r\nevents impending, which will do it within a few months? The crisis with\r\nEngland, the public and authentic avowal of sentiments hostile to the\r\nleading principles of our Constitution, the prospect of a war, in which\r\nwe shall stand alone, land tax, stamp tax, increase of public debt, &c.\r\nBe this as it may, in every free and deliberating society, there must,\r\nfrom the nature of man, be opposite parties, and violent dissensions and\r\ndiscords; and one of these, for the most part, must prevail over the other\r\nfor a longer or shorter time. Perhaps this party division is necessary\r\nto induce each to watch and delate to the people the proceedings of the\r\nother. But if on a temporary superiority of the one party, the other is to\r\nresort to a scission of the Union, no federal government can ever exist.\r\nIf to rid ourselves of the present rule of Massachusetts and Connecticut,\r\nwe break the Union, will the evil stop there? Suppose the New England\r\nStates alone cut off, will our nature be changed? Are we not men still\r\nto the south of that, and with all the passions of men? Immediately,\r\nwe shall see a Pennsylvania and a Virginia party arise in the residuary\r\nconfederacy, and the public mind will be distracted with the same party\r\nspirit. What a game too will the one party have in their hands, by\r\neternally threatening the other that unless they do so and so, they will\r\njoin their northern neighbors. If we reduce our Union to Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina, immediately the conflict will be established between the\r\nrepresentatives of these two States, and they will end by breaking into\r\ntheir simple units. Seeing, therefore, that an association of men who will\r\nnot quarrel with one another is a thing which never yet existed, from\r\nthe greatest confederacy of nations down to a town meeting or a vestry;\r\nseeing that we must have somebody to quarrel with, I had rather keep\r\nour New England associates for that purpose, than to see our bickerings\r\ntransferred to others. They are circumscribed within such narrow limits,\r\nand their population so full, that their numbers will ever be the\r\nminority, and they are marked, like the Jews, with such a perversity of\r\ncharacter, as to constitute, from that circumstance, the natural division\r\nof our parties. A little patience, and we shall see the reign of witches\r\npass over, their spells dissolved, and the people recovering their true\r\nsight, restoring their government to its true principles. It is true,\r\nthat in the meantime, we are suffering deeply in spirit, and incurring\r\nthe horrors of a war, and long oppressions of enormous public debt. But\r\nwho can say what would be the evils of a scission, and when and where they\r\nwould end? Better keep together as we are, haul off from Europe as soon as\r\nwe can, and from all attachments to any portions of it; and if they show\r\ntheir power just sufficiently to hoop us together, it will be the happiest\r\nsituation in which we can exist. If the game runs sometimes against us\r\nat home, we must have patience till luck turns, and then we shall have an\r\nopportunity of winning back the _principles_ we have lost. For this is a\r\ngame where principles are the stake. Better luck, therefore, to us all,\r\nand health, happiness and friendly salutations to yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\nP. S. It is hardly necessary to caution you to let nothing of mine get\r\nbefore the public; a single sentence got hold of by the Porcupines, will\r\nsuffice to abuse and persecute me in their papers for months.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, June 1, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Volney's departure for France gives me an opportunity\r\nof writing to you. I was happy in observing, for many days after your\r\ndeparture, that our winds were favorable for you. I hope, therefore, you\r\nquickly passed the cruising grounds on our coast, and have safely arrived\r\nat the term of your journey. Your departure is not yet known, or even\r\nsuspected.[10] Niemsevioz was much affected. He is now at the federal\r\ncity. He desired me to have some things taken care of for you. There were\r\nsome kitchen furniture, backgammon table and chess men, and a pelise of\r\nfine fur. The latter I have taken to my own apartment and had packed in\r\nhops, and sewed up; the former are put into a warehouse of Mr. Barnes; all\r\nsubject to your future orders. Some letters came for you soon after your\r\ndeparture: the person who delivered them said there were enclosed in them\r\nsome for your friend whom you left here, and desired I would open them.\r\nI did so in his presence, found only one letter for your friend, took\r\nit out and sealed the letters again in the presence of the same person,\r\nwithout reading a word or looking who they were from. I now forward them\r\nto you, as I do this to my friend Jacob Van Staphorst, at Paris. Our alien\r\nbill struggles hard for a passage. It has been considerably mollified. It\r\nis not yet through the Senate. We are proceeding further and further in\r\nwar measures. I consider that event as almost inevitable. I am extremely\r\nanxious to hear from you, to know what sort of a passage you had, how you\r\nfind yourself, and the state and prospect of things in Europe. I hope\r\nI shall not be long without hearing from you. The first dividend which\r\nwill be drawn for you and remitted, will be in January, and as the winter\r\npassages are dangerous, it will not be forwarded till April; after that,\r\nregularly, from six months to six months. This will be done by Mr. Barnes.\r\nI shall leave this place in three weeks. The times do not permit an\r\nindulgence in political disquisitions. But they forbid not the effusion of\r\nfriendship, and not my warmest toward you, which no time will alter. Your\r\nprinciples and dispositions were made to be honored, revered and loved.\r\nTrue to a single object, the freedom and happiness of man, they have not\r\nveered about with the changelings and apostates of our acquaintance. May\r\nhealth and happiness ever attend you. Accept sincere assurances of my\r\naffectionate esteem and respect. Adieu.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [10] [Shortly before, Mr. Jefferson had obtained passports\r\n         for General Kosciusko, under an assumed name, from the foreign\r\n         ministers in this country.

I expected mine of the\r\n14th would have been my last from hence, as I had proposed to set out\r\non the 20th; but on the morning of the 19th, we heard of the arrival\r\nof Marshall at New York, and I concluded to stay and see whether that\r\ncircumstance would produce any new projects. No doubt he there received\r\nmore than hints from Hamilton as to the tone required to be assumed. Yet\r\nI apprehend he is not hot enough for his friends. Livingston came with him\r\nfrom New York. Marshall told him they had no idea in France of a war with\r\nus. That Talleyrand sent passports to him and Pinckney, but none to Gerry.\r\nUpon this, Gerry staid, without explaining to them the reason. He wrote,\r\nhowever, to the President by Marshall, who knew nothing of the contents of\r\nthe letter. So that there must have been a previous understanding between\r\nTalleyrand and Gerry. Marshall was received here with the utmost eclat.\r\nThe Secretary of State and many carriages, with all the city cavalry,\r\nwent to Frankfort to meet him, and on his arrival here in the evening,\r\nthe bells rung till late in the night, and immense crowds were collected\r\nto see and make part of the show, which was circuitously paraded through\r\nthe streets before he was set down at the City tavern. All this was to\r\nsecure him to their views, that he might say nothing which would oppose\r\nthe game they have been playing. Since his arrival I can hear of nothing\r\ndirectly from him, while they are disseminating through the town things,\r\nas from him, diametrically opposite to what he said to Livingston. Doctor\r\nLogan, about a fortnight ago, sailed for Hamburg. Though for a twelvemonth\r\npast he had been intending to go to Europe as soon as he could get money\r\nenough to carry him there, yet when he had accomplished this, and fixed\r\na time for going, he very unwisely made a mystery of it: so that his\r\ndisappearance without notice excited conversation. This was seized by the\r\nwar hawks, and given out as a secret mission from the Jacobins here to\r\nsolicit an army from France, instruct them as to their landing, &c. This\r\nextravagance produced a real panic among the citizens; and happening just\r\nwhen Bache published Talleyrand's letter, Harper, on the 18th, gravely\r\nannounced to the House of Representatives, that there existed a traitorous\r\ncorrespondence between the Jacobins here and the French Directory;\r\nthat he had got hold of some threads and clues of it, and would soon\r\nbe able to develop the whole. This increased the alarm; their libelists\r\nimmediately set to work, directly and indirectly to implicate whom they\r\npleased. Porcupine gave me a principal share in it, as I am told, for I\r\nnever read his papers. This state of things added to my reasons for not\r\ndeparting at the time I intended. These follies seem to have died away\r\nin some degree already. Perhaps I may renew my purpose by the 25th. Their\r\nsystem is, professedly, to keep up an alarm. Tracy, at the meeting of the\r\njoint committee for adjournment, declared it necessary for Congress to\r\nstay together to keep up the inflammation of the public mind; and Otis\r\nhas expressed a similar sentiment since. However, they will adjourn. The\r\nopposers of an adjournment in Senate, yesterday agreed to adjourn on the\r\n10th of July. But I think the 1st of July will be carried. That is one of\r\nthe objects which detain myself, as well as one or two more of the Senate,\r\nwho had got leave of absence. I imagine it will be decided to-morrow or\r\nnext day. To separate Congress now, will be withdrawing the fire from\r\nunder a boiling pot.\r\n\r\nMy respectful salutations to Mrs. Madison, and cordial friendship to\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nP. M. A message to both Houses this day from the President, with the\r\nfollowing communications.\r\n\r\nMarch 23. Pickering's letter to the Envoys, directing them, if they are\r\nnot actually engaged in negotiation with authorized persons, or if it is\r\nnot conducted _bonâ fide_, and not merely for procrastination, to break up\r\nand come home, and at any rate to consent to no loan.\r\n\r\nApril 3. Talleyrand to Gerry. He supposes the other two gentlemen,\r\nperceiving that their known principles are an obstacle to negotiation,\r\nwill leave there public, and proposes to renew the negotiations with Gerry\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nApril 4. Gerry to Talleyrand. Disclaims a power to conclude anything\r\nseparately, can only confer informally and as an unaccredited person\r\nor individual, reserving to lay everything before the government of the\r\nUnited States for approbation.\r\n\r\nApril 14. Gerry to the President. He communicates the preceding, and\r\nhopes the President will send other persons instead of his colleagues and\r\nhimself, if it shall appear that anything can be done.\r\n\r\nThe President's message says, that as the instructions were not to consent\r\nto any loan, he considers the negotiations as at an end, and that he will\r\nnever send another minister to France, until he shall be assured that he\r\nwill be received and treated with the respect due to a great, powerful,\r\nfree and independent nation.\r\n\r\nA bill was brought in the Senate this day, to declare the treaties with\r\nFrance void, prefaced by a list of grievances in the style of a manifesto.\r\nIt passed to the second reading by fourteen to five.\r\n\r\nA bill for punishing forgeries of bank paper, passed to the third reading\r\nby fourteen to six.

NOLAN.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, June 24, 1798.\r\n\r\nSIR,--It is sometime since I have understood that there are large herds\r\nof horses in a wild state, in the country west of the Mississippi, and\r\nhave been desirous of obtaining details of their history in that State.\r\nMr. Brown, Senator from Kentucky, informs me it would be in your power\r\nto give interesting information on this subject, and encourages me to\r\nask it. The circumstances of the old world have, beyond the records of\r\nhistory, been such as admitted not that animal to exist in a state of\r\nnature. The condition of America is rapidly advancing to the same. The\r\npresent then is probably the only moment in the age of the world, and the\r\nherds above mentioned the only subjects, of which we can avail ourselves\r\nto obtain what has never yet been recorded, and never can be again in\r\nall probability. I will add that your information is the sole reliance,\r\nas far as I can at present see, for obtaining this desideratum. You will\r\nrender to natural history a very acceptable service, therefore, if you\r\nwill enable our Philosophical society to add so interesting a chapter\r\nto the history of this animal. I need not specify to you the particular\r\nfacts asked for; as your knowledge of the animal in his domesticated, as\r\nwell as his wild state, will naturally have led your attention to those\r\nparticulars in the manners, habits, and laws of his existence, which are\r\npeculiar to his wild state. I wish you not to be anxious about the form of\r\nyour information, the exactness of the substance alone is material; and\r\nif, after giving in a first letter all the facts you at present possess,\r\nyou would be so good, on subsequent occasions, as to furnish such others\r\nin addition, as you may acquire from time to time, your communications\r\nwill always be thankfully received, if addressed to me at Monticello;\r\nand put into any post office in Kentucky or Tennessee, they will reach me\r\nspeedily and safely, and will be considered as obligations on, sir, your\r\nmost obedient, humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 22, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of August the 4th came to hand by our last post,\r\ntogether with the \"extract of a letter from a gentleman of Philadelphia,\r\ndated July the 10th,\" cut from a newspaper stating some facts which\r\nrespect me. I shall notice these facts. The writer says that \"the day\r\nafter the last despatches were communicated to Congress, Bache, Leib, &c.,\r\nand a Dr. Reynolds, were _closeted_ with me.\" If the receipt of visits\r\nin my public room, the door continuing free to every one who should call\r\nat the same time, may be called _closeting_, then it is true that I was\r\n_closeted_ with every person who visited me; in no other sense is it\r\ntrue as to any person. I sometimes received visits from Mr. Bache and\r\nDr. Leib. I received them always with pleasure, because they are men of\r\nabilities, and of principles the most friendly to liberty and our present\r\nform of government. Mr. Bache has another claim on my respect, as being\r\nthe grandson of Dr. Franklin, the greatest man and ornament of the age and\r\ncountry in which he lived. Whether I was visited by Mr. Bache or Dr. Leib\r\nthe day after the communication referred to, I do not remember. I know\r\nthat all my motions in Philadelphia, here, and everywhere, are watched and\r\nrecorded. Some of these spies, therefore, may remember better than I do,\r\nthe dates of these visits. If they say that these two gentlemen visited me\r\non the day after the communication, as their trade proves their accuracy,\r\nI shall not contradict them, though I affirm that I do not recollect it.\r\nHowever, as to Dr. Reynolds I can be more particular, because I never\r\nsaw him but once, which was on an introductory visit he was so kind as\r\nto pay me. This, I well remember, was before the communication alluded\r\nto, and that during the short conversation I had with him, not one word\r\nwas said on the subject of any of the communications. Not that I should\r\nnot have spoken freely on their subject to Dr. Reynolds, as I should also\r\nhave done to the letter writer, or to any other person who should have\r\nintroduced the subject. I know my own principles to be pure, and therefore\r\nam not ashamed of them. On the contrary, I wish them known, and therefore\r\nwillingly express them to every one. They are the same I have acted on\r\nfrom the year 1775 to this day, and are the same, I am sure, with those of\r\nthe great body of the American people. I only wish the real principles of\r\nthose who censure mine were also known. But warring against those of the\r\npeople, the delusion of the people is necessary to the dominant party. I\r\nsee the extent to which that delusion has been already carried, and I see\r\nthere is no length to which it may not be pushed by a party in possession\r\nof the revenues and the legal authorities of the United States, for a\r\nshort time indeed, but yet long enough to admit much particular mischief.\r\nThere is no event, therefore, however atrocious, which may not be\r\nexpected. I have contemplated every event which the Maratists of the day\r\ncan perpetrate, and am prepared to meet every one in such a way, as shall\r\nnot be derogatory either to the public liberty or my own personal honor.\r\nThe letter writer says, I am \"for peace; but it is only with France.\" He\r\nhas told half the truth. He would have told the whole, if he had added\r\nEngland. I am for peace with both countries. I know that both of them have\r\ngiven, and are daily giving, sufficient cause of war; that in defiance\r\nof the laws of nations, they are every day trampling on the rights of the\r\nneutral powers, whenever they can thereby do the least injury, either to\r\nthe other. But, as I view a peace between France and England the ensuing\r\nwinter to be certain, I have thought it would have been better for us to\r\ncontinue to bear from France through the present summer, what we have been\r\nbearing both from her and England these four years, and still continue\r\nto bear from England, and to have required indemnification in the hour\r\nof peace, when I verily believe it would have been yielded by both. This\r\nseems to have been the plan of the other neutral nations; and whether\r\nthis, or the commencing war on one of them, as we have done, would have\r\nbeen wisest, time and events must decide. But I am quite at a loss on what\r\nground the letter writer can question the opinion, that France had no\r\nintention of making war on us, and was willing to treat with Mr. Gerry,\r\nwhen we have this from Talleyrand's letter, and from the written and\r\nverbal information of our Envoys. It is true then, that, as with England,\r\nwe might of right have chosen either war or peace, and have chosen peace,\r\nand prudently in my opinion, so with France, we might also of right have\r\nchosen either peace or war, and we have chosen war. Whether the choice\r\nmay be a popular one in the other States, I know not. Here it certainly is\r\nnot; and I have no doubt the whole American people will rally ere long to\r\nthe same sentiment, and rejudge those who, at present, think they have all\r\njudgment in their own hands.\r\n\r\nThese observations will show you, how far the imputations in the paragraph\r\nsent me approach the truth. Yet they are not intended for a newspaper. At\r\na very early period of my life, I determined never to put a sentence into\r\nany newspaper. I have religiously adhered to the resolution through my\r\nlife, and have great reason to be contented with it. Were I to undertake\r\nto answer the calumnies of the newspapers, it would be more than all my\r\nown time, and that of twenty aids could effect. For while I should be\r\nanswering one, twenty new ones would be invented. I have thought it better\r\nto trust to the justice of my countrymen, that they would judge me by what\r\nthey _see_ of my conduct on the stage where they have placed me, and what\r\nthey knew of me _before_ the epoch since which a particular party has\r\nsupposed it might answer some view of theirs to vilify me in the public\r\neye. Some, I know, will not reflect how apocryphal is the testimony of\r\nenemies so palpably betraying the views with which they give it. But this\r\nis an injury to which duty requires every one to submit whom the public\r\nthink proper to call into its councils. I thank you, my dear Sir, for the\r\ninterest you have for me on this occasion. Though I have made up my mind\r\nnot to suffer calumny to disturb my tranquillity, yet I retain all my\r\nsensibilities for the approbation of the good and just. That is, indeed,\r\nthe chief consolation for the hatred of so many, who, without the least\r\npersonal knowledge, and on the sacred evidence of Porcupine and Fenno\r\nalone, cover me with their implacable hatred. The only return I will ever\r\nmake them, will be to do them all the good I can, in spite of their teeth.\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure to inform you that all your friends in this quarter\r\nare well, and to assure you of the sentiments of sincere esteem and\r\nrespect with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. H. ROWAN.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 26, 1798.\r\n\r\nSIR,--To avoid the suspicions and curiosity of the post office, which\r\nwould have been excited by seeing your name and mine on the back of a\r\nletter, I have delayed acknowledging the receipt of your favor of July\r\nlast, till an occasion to write to an inhabitant of Wilmington gives me\r\nan opportunity of putting my letter under cover to him. The system of\r\nalarm and jealousy which has been so powerfully played off in England, has\r\nbeen mimicked here, not entirely without success. The most long-sighted\r\npolitician could not, seven years ago, have imagined that the people of\r\nthis wide-extended country could have been enveloped in such delusion, and\r\nmade so much afraid of themselves and their own power, as to surrender it\r\nspontaneously to those who are manœuvring them into a form of government,\r\nthe principal branches of which may be beyond their control. The commerce\r\nof England, however, has spread its roots over the whole face of our\r\ncountry. This is the real source of all the obliquities of the public\r\nmind; and I should have had doubts of the ultimate term they might attain;\r\nbut happily, the game, to be worth the playing of those engaged in it,\r\nmust flush them with money. The authorized expenses of this year are\r\nbeyond those of any year in the late war for independence, and they are\r\nof a nature to beget great and constant expenses. The purse of the people\r\nis the real seat of sensibility. It is to be drawn upon largely, and they\r\nwill then listen to truths which could not excite them through any other\r\norgan. In this State, however, the delusion has not prevailed. They are\r\nsufficiently on their guard to have justified the assurance, that should\r\nyou choose it for your asylum, the laws of the land, administered by\r\nupright judges, would protect you from any exercise of power unauthorized\r\nby the Constitution of the United States. The Habeas Corpus secures every\r\nman here, alien or citizen, against everything which is not law, whatever\r\nshape it may assume. Should this, or any other circumstance, draw your\r\nfootsteps this way, I shall be happy to be among those who may have an\r\nopportunity of testifying, by every attention in our power, the sentiments\r\nof esteem and respect which the circumstances of your history have\r\ninspired, and which are peculiarly felt by, Sir, your most obedient, and\r\nmost humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO STEPHENS THOMPSON MASON.\r\n\r\n                                              MONTICELLO, October 11, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to thank you for your favor of July the 6th, from\r\nPhiladelphia. I did not immediately acknowledge it, because I knew you\r\nwould have come away. The X. Y. Z. fever has considerably abated through\r\nthe country, as I am informed, and the alien and sedition laws are working\r\nhard. I fancy that some of the State legislatures will take strong ground\r\non this occasion. For my own part, I consider those laws as merely an\r\nexperiment on the American mind, to see how far it will hear an avowed\r\nviolation of the Constitution. If this goes down, we shall immediately\r\nsee attempted another act of Congress, declaring that the President shall\r\ncontinue in office during life, reserving to another occasion the transfer\r\nof the succession to his heirs, and the establishment of the Senate for\r\nlife. At least, this may be the aim of the Oliverians, while Monk and\r\nthe Cavaliers (who are perhaps the strongest) may be playing their game\r\nfor the restoration of his most gracious Majesty George the Third. That\r\nthese things are in contemplation, I have no doubt; nor can I be confident\r\nof their failure, after the dupery of which our countrymen have shown\r\nthemselves susceptible.\r\n\r\nYou promised to endeavor to send me some tenants. I am waiting for them,\r\nhaving broken up two excellent farms with twelve fields in them of forty\r\nacres each, some of which I have sowed with small grain. Tenants of\r\nany size may be accommodated with the number of fields suited to their\r\nforce. Only send me good people, and write me what they are. Adieu. Yours\r\naffectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 17, 1798.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a copy of the draught of the Kentucky resolutions. I think\r\nwe should distinctly affirm all the important principles they contain,\r\nso as to hold to that ground in future, and leave the matter in such a\r\ntrain as that we may not be committed absolutely to push the matter to\r\nextremities, and yet may be free to push as far as events will render\r\nprudent. I think to set out so as to arrive at Philadelphia the Saturday\r\nbefore Christmas. My friendly respects to Mrs. Madison, to your father and\r\nfamily; health, happiness and adieu to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN TAYLOR.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 26, 1798.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--We formerly had a debtor and creditor account of letters on\r\nfarming; but the high price of tobacco, which is likely to continue for\r\nsome short time, has tempted me to go entirely into that culture, and\r\nin the meantime, my farming schemes are in abeyance, and my farming\r\nfields at nurse against the time of my resuming them. But I owe you\r\na political letter. Yet the infidelities of the post office and the\r\ncircumstances of the times are against my writing fully and freely,\r\nwhilst my own dispositions are as much against mysteries, innuendos and\r\nhalf-confidences. I know not which mortifies me most, that I should fear\r\nto write what I think, or my country bear such a state of things. Yet\r\nLyon's judges, and a jury of all nations, are objects of national fear.\r\nWe agree in all the essential ideas of your letter. We agree particularly\r\nin the necessity of some reform, and of some better security for civil\r\nliberty. But perhaps we do not see the existing circumstances in the same\r\npoint of view. There are many consideration _dehors_ of the State, which\r\nwill occur to you without enumeration. I should not apprehend them, if\r\nall was sound within. But there is a most respectable part of our State\r\nwho have been enveloped in the X. Y. Z. delusion, and who destroy our\r\nunanimity for the present moment. This disease of the imagination will\r\npass over, because the patients are essentially republicans. Indeed, the\r\nDoctor is now on his way to cure it, in the guise of a tax gatherer. But\r\ngive time for the medicine to work, and for the repetition of stronger\r\ndoses, which must be administered. The principle of the present majority\r\nis _excessive expense_, money enough to fill all their maws, or it will\r\nnot be worth the risk of their supporting. They cannot borrow a dollar\r\nin Europe, or above two or three millions in America. This is not the\r\nfourth of the expenses of this year, unprovided for. Paper money would be\r\nperilous even to the paper men. Nothing then but excessive taxation can\r\nget us along; and this will carry reason and reflection to every man's\r\ndoor, and particularly in the hour of election.\r\n\r\nI wish it were possible to obtain a single amendment to our Constitution.\r\nI would be willing to depend on that alone for the reduction of the\r\nadministration of our government to the genuine principles of its\r\nConstitution; I mean an additional article, taking from the federal\r\ngovernment the power of borrowing. I now deny their power of making\r\npaper money or anything else a legal tender. I know that to pay all\r\nproper expenses within the year, would, in case of war, be hard on us.\r\nBut not so hard as ten wars instead of one. For wars would be reduced\r\nin that proportion; besides that the State governments would be free to\r\nlend _their credit_ in borrowing quotas. For the present, I should be\r\nfor resolving the alien and sedition laws to be against the Constitution\r\nand merely void, and for addressing the other States to obtain similar\r\ndeclarations: and I would not do anything at this moment which should\r\ncommit us further, but reserve ourselves to shape our future measures or\r\nno measures, by the events which may happen. It is a singular phenomenon,\r\nthat while our State governments are the _very best in the world_, without\r\nexception or comparison, our General Government has, in the rapid course\r\nof nine or ten years, become more arbitrary, and has swallowed more of the\r\npublic liberty than even that of England. I enclose you a column, cut out\r\nof a London paper, to show you that the English, though charmed with our\r\nmaking their enemies our enemies, yet blush and weep over our sedition\r\nlaw. But I enclose you something more important. It is a petition for a\r\nreformation in the manner of appointing our juries, and a remedy against\r\nthe _jury of all nations_, which is handing about here for signature,\r\nand will be presented to your House. I know it will require but little\r\ningenuity to make objections to the details of its execution; but do not\r\nbe discouraged by small difficulties; make it as perfect as you can at a\r\nfirst essay, and depend on amending its defects as they develop themselves\r\nin practice. I hope it will meet with your approbation and patronage. It\r\nis the only thing which can yield us a little present protection against\r\nthe dominion of a faction, while circumstances are maturing for bringing\r\nand keeping the government in real unison with the spirit of their\r\nconstituents. I am aware that the act of Congress has directed that juries\r\nshall be appointed by lot or otherwise, as the laws _now_ (at the date of\r\nthe act) in force in the several States provide. The New England States\r\nhave always had them elected by their select men, who are elected by the\r\npeople. Several or most of the other States have a large number appointed\r\n(I do not know how) to attend, out of whom twelve for each cause are\r\ntaken by lot. This provision of Congress will render it necessary for our\r\nSenators or Delegates to apply for an amendatory law, accommodated to that\r\nprayed for in the petition. In the meantime, I would pass the law as if\r\nthe amendatory one existed, in reliance, that our select jurors attending,\r\nthe federal judge will, under a sense of right, direct the juries to be\r\ntaken from among them. If he does not, or if Congress refuses to pass the\r\namendatory law, it will serve as eye-water for their constituents. Health,\r\nhappiness, _safety_ and esteem to yourself and my ever-honored and ancient\r\nfriend, Mr. Pendleton. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                             PHILADELPHIA, January 3, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have suffered the post hour to come so nearly on me, that\r\nI must huddle over what I have more than appears in the public papers.\r\nI arrived here on Christmas day, not a single bill or other article of\r\nbusiness having yet been brought into Senate. The President's speech, so\r\nunlike himself in point of moderation, is supposed to have been written\r\nby the military conclave, and particularly Hamilton. When the Senate\r\ngratuitously hint Logan to him, you see him in his reply come out in his\r\ngenuine colors. The debates on that subject and Logan's declaration you\r\nwill see in the papers. The republican spirit is supposed to be gaining\r\nground in this State and Massachusetts. The tax gatherer has already\r\nexcited discontent. Gerry's correspondence with Talleyrand, promised by\r\nthe President at the opening of the session, is still kept back. It is\r\nknown to show France in a very conciliatory attitude, and to contradict\r\nsome executive assertions. Therefore, it is supposed they will get their\r\nwar measures well taken before they will produce this damper. Vans Murray\r\nwrites them, that the French government is sincere in their overtures for\r\nreconciliation, and have agreed, if these fail, to admit the mediation\r\noffered by the Dutch government.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeneral Knox has become bankrupt for four hundred thousand dollars, and\r\nhas resigned his military commission. He took in General Lincoln for one\r\nhundred and fifty thousand dollars, which breaks him. Colonel Jackson\r\nalso sunk with him. It seems generally admitted, that several cases of\r\nthe yellow fever still exist in the city, and the apprehension is, that it\r\nwill re-appear early in the spring. You promised me a copy of McGee's bill\r\nof prices. Be so good as to send it on to me here. Tell Mrs. Madison her\r\nfriend Madame d'Yrujo, is as well as one can be so near to a formidable\r\ncrisis. Present my friendly respects to her, and accept yourself my\r\nsincere and affectionate salutations. Adieu.\r\n\r\nP. S. I omitted to mention that a petition has been presented to the\r\nPresident, signed by several thousand persons in Vermont, praying a\r\nremitment of Lyon's fine. He asked the bearer of the petition if Lyon\r\nhimself had petitioned, and being answered in the negative, said,\r\n\"penitence must precede pardon.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 16, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The forgery lately attempted to be played off by Mr. H. on the\r\nHouse of Representatives, of a pretended memorial presented by Logan to\r\nthe French government, has been so palpably exposed, as to have thrown\r\nridicule on the whole of the clamors they endeavored to raise as to that\r\ntransaction. Still, however, their majority will pass the bill. The real\r\nviews in the importance they have given to Logan's enterprise are mistaken\r\nby nobody. Mr. Gerry's communications relative to his transactions after\r\nthe departure of his colleagues, though he has now been returned five\r\nmonths, and they have been promised to the House six or seven weeks,\r\nare still kept back. In the meantime, the paper of this morning promises\r\nthem from the Paris papers. It is said, they leave not a possibility to\r\ndoubt the sincerity and the anxiety of the French government to avoid the\r\nspectacle of a war with us. Notwithstanding this is well understood, the\r\narmy and a great addition to our navy, are steadily intended. A loan of\r\nfive millions is opened at eight per cent. interest!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn a society of members, between whom and myself are great mutual esteem\r\nand respect, a most anxious desire is expressed that you would publish\r\nyour debates of the convention. That these measures of the army, navy\r\nand direct tax will bring about a revolution of public sentiment is\r\nthought certain, and that the Constitution will then receive a different\r\nexplanation. Could those debates be ready to appear critically, their\r\neffect would be decisive. I beg of you to turn this subject in your mind.\r\nTho arguments against it will be personal; those in favor of it moral;\r\nand something is required from you as a set off against the sin of your\r\nretirement. Your favor of December the 29th came to hand January the 5th;\r\nseal sound. I pray you always to examine the seals of mine to you, and the\r\nstrength of the impression. The suspicions against the government on this\r\nsubject are strong. I wrote you January the 5th. Accept for yourself and\r\nMrs. Madison my affectionate salutations. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 23, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The newspapers furnish you with the articles of common news as\r\nwell as the Congressional. You observe the addition proposed to be made\r\nto our Navy, and the loan of five millions, opened at eight per cent.,\r\nto equip it. The papers say that our agents abroad are purchasing vessels\r\nfor this purpose. The following is as accurate a statement of our income\r\nand expense annual, as I can form, after divesting the Treasury reports of\r\nsuch articles as are incidental, and properly _annual_:\r\n\r\n  1798--Imports                               $7,405,420 76.\r\n        Excise Auctions, Libraries, Carriages    585,879 67.\r\n        Postage                                   57,000\r\n        Patents                                    1,050\r\n        Coinage                                   10,202\r\n        Dividends of Bank Stock                   79,920\r\n        Fines                                          8\r\n                                              --------------\r\n                                              $8,139,520 43.\r\n  1799--Direct Tax, }  Clear of expense        2,000,000\r\n        Stamp Tax,\r\n                                              --------------\r\n                                             $10,139,520\r\n\r\n  Interest and reimbursement of domestic\r\n    debt                                      $2,987,145 48\r\n  Interest on domestic loans                     238,637 50\r\n  Dutch debt                                     586,829 58--$3,812,612 56\r\n  Civil list                                                    524,206 83\r\n  Loan office                                                    13,000\r\n  Mint                                                           13,300\r\n  Light-houses                                                   44,281 58\r\n  Annuities and Grants                                            1,603 33\r\n  Military Pensions                                              93,400\r\n  Miscellaneous expenses                                         19,000\r\n  Contingent expenses of Government                              20,000\r\n  Amount of Civil Government property             728,191 24\r\n  Indians                                                       110,000\r\n  Foreign intercourse                               93,000\r\n  Treaties with G.

When they are complete, we shall have to raise by\r\nnew taxes about five millions more, making in the whole fifteen millions,\r\nwhich if our population be five millions, will be three dollars a head.\r\nBut these additional taxes will not be wanting, till the session after the\r\nnext. The majority in Congress being as in the last session, matters will\r\ngo on now as then. I shall send you Gerry's correspondence and Pickering's\r\nreport on it, by which you will perceive the willingness of France to\r\ntreat with us, and our determination not to believe it, and therefore to\r\ngo to war with them. For in this light must be viewed our surrounding\r\ntheir islands with our armed vessels instead of their cruising on our\r\ncoasts as the law directs.\r\n\r\nAccording to information, there is real reason to believe that the X.\r\nY. Z. delusion is wearing off, and the public mind beginning to take the\r\nsame direction it was getting into before that measure. Gerry's dispatches\r\nwill tend strongly to open the eyes of the people. Besides this several\r\nother impressive circumstances will all be bearing on the public mind.\r\nThe alien and sedition laws as before, the direct tax, the additional\r\narmy and navy, an usurious loan to set these follies on foot, a prospect\r\nof heavy additional taxes as soon as they are completed, still heavier\r\ntaxes if the government forces on the war, recruiting officers lounging at\r\nevery court-house and decoying the laborer from his plough. A clause in a\r\nbill now under debate for opening commerce with Toussaint and his black\r\nsubjects now in open rebellion with France, will be a circumstance of\r\nhigh aggravation to that country, and in addition to our cruising around\r\ntheir islands will put their patience to a great proof. One fortunate\r\ncircumstance is that, annihilated as they are on the ocean, they cannot\r\nget at us for some time, and this will give room for the popular sentiment\r\nto correct the imprudence. Nothing is believed of the stories about\r\nBonaparte. Those about Ireland have a more serious aspect. I delivered\r\nthe letter from you of which I was the bearer. No use was made of the\r\npaper, because that poor creature had already fallen too low even for\r\ncontempt. It seems that the representative of our district is attached to\r\nhis seat. Mr. Bachley tells me you have the collection of a sum of money\r\nfor him, which is destined for me. What is the prospect of getting it,\r\nand how much? I do not know whether I have before informed you that Mr.\r\nMadison paid to Mr. Barnes $240 or $250 in your name to be placed to your\r\ncredit with Mr. Short, I consequently squared that account, and debited\r\nyou to myself for the balance. This with another article or two of account\r\nbetween us, stands therefore against the books for which I am indebted\r\nto you, and for which I know not the cost. A very important measure is\r\nunder contemplation here, which, if adopted, will require a considerable\r\nsum of money _on loan_. The thing being beyond the abilities of those\r\npresent, they will possibly be obliged to assess their friends also. I\r\nmay perhaps be forced to score you for fifty or one hundred dollars, to\r\nbe paid at convenience, but as yet it is only talked of. I shall rest my\r\njustification on the importance of the measure, and the sentiments I know\r\nyou to entertain on such subjects. We consider the elections on the whole\r\nas rather in our favor, and particularly believe those of North Carolina\r\nwill immediately come right. J. Nicholas and Brent, both offer again. My\r\nfriendly respects to Mrs. Monroe, and to yourself affectionate salutations\r\nand adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 26, 1799.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--Your favor of November the 12th was safely delivered to me\r\nby Mr. Binney; but not till December the 28th, as I arrived here only\r\nthree days before that date. It was received with great satisfaction.\r\nOur very long intimacy as fellow laborers in the same cause, the recent\r\nexpressions of mutual confidence which had preceded your mission, the\r\ninteresting course which that had taken, and particularly and personally\r\nas it regarded yourself, made me anxious to hear from you on your return.\r\nI was the more so too, as I had myself, during the whole of your absence,\r\nas well as since your return, been a constant butt for every shaft of\r\ncalumny which malice and falsehood could form, and the presses, public\r\nspeakers, or private letters disseminate. One of these, too, was of a\r\nnature to touch yourself; as if, wanting confidence in your efforts, I\r\nhad been capable of usurping powers committed to you, and authorizing\r\nnegotiations private and collateral to yours. The real truth is, that\r\nthough Doctor Logan, the pretended missionary, about four or five days\r\nbefore he sailed for Hamburgh, told me he was going there, and thence to\r\nParis, and asked and received from me a certificate of his citizenship,\r\ncharacter, and circumstances of life, merely as a protection, should\r\nhe be molested on his journey, in the present turbulent and suspicious\r\nstate of Europe, yet I had been led to consider his object as relative\r\nto his private affairs; and though, from an intimacy of some standing,\r\nhe knew well my wishes for peace and my political sentiments in general,\r\nhe nevertheless received then no particular declaration of them, no\r\nauthority to communicate them to any mortal, nor to speak to any one in\r\nmy name, or in anybody's name, on that, or on any other subject whatever;\r\nnor did I write by him a scrip of a pen to any person whatever. This he\r\nhas himself honestly and publicly declared since his return; and from\r\nhis well-known character and every other circumstance, every candid man\r\nmust perceive that his enterprise was dictated by his own enthusiasm,\r\nwithout consultation or communication with any one; that he acted in Paris\r\non his own ground, and made his own way. Yet to give some color to his\r\nproceedings, which might implicate the republicans in general, and myself\r\nparticularly, they have not been ashamed to bring forward a suppositious\r\npaper, drawn by one of their own party in the name of Logan, and falsely\r\npretended to have been presented by him to the government of France;\r\ncounting that the bare mention of my name therein, would connect that\r\nin the eye of the public with this transaction. In confutation of these\r\nand all future calumnies, by way of anticipation, I shall make to you a\r\nprofession of my political faith; in confidence that you will consider\r\nevery future imputation on me of a contrary complexion, as bearing on its\r\nfront the mark of falsehood and calumny.\r\n\r\nI do then, with sincere zeal, wish an inviolable preservation of our\r\npresent federal Constitution, according to the true sense in which it was\r\nadopted by the States, that in which it was advocated by its friends,\r\nand not that which its enemies apprehended, who therefore became its\r\nenemies; and I am opposed to the monarchising its features by the forms\r\nof its administration, with a view to conciliate a first transition to\r\na President and Senate for life, and from that to an hereditary tenure\r\nof these offices, and thus to worm out the elective principle. I am for\r\npreserving to the States the powers not yielded by them to the Union, and\r\nto the legislature of the Union its constitutional share in the division\r\nof powers; and I am not for transferring all the powers of the States to\r\nthe General Government, and all those of that government to the executive\r\nbranch. I am for a government rigorously frugal and simple, applying\r\nall the possible savings of the public revenue to the discharge of the\r\nnational debt; and not for a multiplication of officers and salaries\r\nmerely to make partisans, and for increasing, by every device, the public\r\ndebt, on the principle of its being a public blessing. I am for relying,\r\nfor internal defence, on our militia solely, till actual invasion, and for\r\nsuch a naval force only as may protect our coasts and harbors from such\r\ndepredations as we have experienced; and not for a standing army in time\r\nof peace, which may overawe the public sentiment; nor for a navy, which,\r\nby its own expenses and the eternal wars in which it will implicate us,\r\nwill grind us with public burthens, and sink us under them. I am for free\r\ncommerce with all nations; political connection with none; and little or\r\nno diplomatic establishment. And I am not for linking ourselves by new\r\ntreaties with the quarrels of Europe; entering that field of slaughter\r\nto preserve their balance, or joining in the confederacy of kings to\r\nwar against the principles of liberty. I am for freedom of religion,\r\nand against all manœuvres to bring about a legal ascendancy of one sect\r\nover another: for freedom of the press, and against all violations of\r\nthe Constitution to silence by force and not by reason the complaints\r\nor criticisms, just or unjust, of our citizens against the conduct of\r\ntheir agents. And I am for encouraging the progress of science in all its\r\nbranches; and not for raising a hue and cry against the sacred name of\r\nphilosophy; for awing the human mind by stories of raw-head and bloody\r\nbones to a distrust of its own vision, and to repose implicitly on that\r\nof others; to go backwards instead of forwards to look for improvement;\r\nto believe that government, religion, morality, and every other science\r\nwere in the highest perfection in ages of the darkest ignorance, and that\r\nnothing can ever be devised more perfect than what was established by\r\nour forefathers. To these I will add, that I was a sincere well-wisher\r\nto the success of the French revolution, and still wish it may end in\r\nthe establishment of a free and well-ordered republic; but I have not\r\nbeen insensible under the atrocious depredations they have committed on\r\nour commerce. The first object of my heart is my own country. In that\r\nis embarked my family, my fortune, and my own existence. I have not one\r\nfarthing of interest, nor one fibre of attachment out of it, nor a single\r\nmotive of preference of any one nation to another, but in proportion\r\nas they are more or less friendly to us. But though deeply feeling the\r\ninjuries of France, I did not think war the surest means of redressing\r\nthem. I did believe, that a mission sincerely disposed to preserve peace,\r\nwould obtain for us a peaceable and honorable settlement and retribution;\r\nand I appeal to you to say, whether this might not have been obtained, if\r\neither of your colleagues had been of the same sentiment with yourself.\r\n\r\nThese, my friend, are my principles; they are unquestionably the\r\nprinciples of the great body of our fellow citizens, and I know there is\r\nnot one of them which is not yours also. In truth, we never differed but\r\non one ground, the funding system; and as, from the moment of its being\r\nadopted by the constituted authorities, I became religiously principled\r\nin the sacred discharge of it to the uttermost farthing, we are united now\r\neven on that single ground of difference.\r\n\r\nI now turn to your inquiries. The enclosed paper will answer one of them.\r\nBut you also ask for such political information as may be possessed by\r\nme, and interesting to yourself in regard to your embassy. As a proof of\r\nmy entire confidence in you, I shall give it fully and candidly. When\r\nPinckney, Marshall, and Dana, were nominated to settle our differences\r\nwith France, it was suspected by many, from what was understood of their\r\ndispositions, that their mission would not result in a settlement of\r\ndifferences, but would produce circumstances tending to widen the breach,\r\nand to provoke our citizens to consent to a war with that nation, and\r\nunion with England. Dana's resignation and your appointment gave the\r\nfirst gleam of hope of a peaceable issue to the mission. For it was\r\nbelieved that you were sincerely disposed to accommodation; and it was\r\nnot long after your arrival there, before symptoms were observed of that\r\ndifference of views which had been suspected to exist. In the meantime,\r\nhowever, the aspect of our government towards the French republic had\r\nbecome so ardent, that the people of America generally took the alarm.\r\nTo the southward, their apprehensions were early excited. In the eastern\r\nStates also, they at length began to break out. Meetings were held in many\r\nof your towns, and addresses to the government agreed on in opposition\r\nto war. The example was spreading like a wildfire. Other meetings were\r\ncalled in other places, and a general concurrence of sentiment against\r\nthe apparent inclinations of the government was imminent; when, most\r\ncritically for the government, the despatches of October 22d, prepared by\r\nyour colleague Marshall, with a view to their being made public, dropped\r\ninto their laps. It was truly a God-send to them, and they made the most\r\nof it. Many thousands of copies were printed and dispersed gratis, at\r\nthe public expense; and the zealots for war co-operated so heartily, that\r\nthere were instances of single individuals who printed and dispersed ten\r\nor twelve thousand copies at their own expense. The odiousness of the\r\ncorruption supposed in those papers excited a general and high indignation\r\namong the people. Unexperienced in such manœuvres, they did not permit\r\nthemselves even to suspect that the turpitude of private swindlers might\r\nmingle itself unobserved, and give its own hue to the communications of\r\nthe French government, of whose participation there was neither proof\r\nnor probability. It served, however, for a time, the purpose intended.\r\nThe people, in many places, gave a loose to the expressions of their\r\nwarm indignation, and of their honest preference of war to dishonor.\r\nThe fever was long and successfully kept up, and in the meantime, war\r\nmeasures as ardently crowded. Still, however, as it was known that your\r\ncolleagues were coming away, and yourself to stay, though disclaiming a\r\nseparate power to conclude a treaty, it was hoped by the lovers of peace,\r\nthat a project of treaty would have been prepared, _ad referendum_, on\r\nprinciples which would have satisfied our citizens, and overawed any bias\r\nof the government towards a different policy. But the expedition of the\r\nSophia, and, as was supposed, the suggestions of the person charged with\r\nyour despatches, and his probable misrepresentations of the real wishes\r\nof the American people, prevented these hopes. They had then only to look\r\nforward to your return for such information, either through the executive,\r\nor from yourself, as might present to our view the other side of the\r\nmedal. The despatches of October 22d, 1797, had presented one face. That\r\ninformation, to a certain degree, is now received, and the public will see\r\nfrom your correspondence with Talleyrand, that France, as you testify,\r\n\"was sincere and anxious to obtain a reconciliation, not wishing us to\r\nbreak the British treaty, but only to give her equivalent stipulations;\r\nand in general was disposed to a liberal treaty.\" And they will judge\r\nwhether Mr. Pickering's report shows an inflexible determination to\r\nbelieve no declarations the French government can make, nor any opinion\r\nwhich you, judging on the spot and from actual view, can give of their\r\nsincerity, and to meet their designs of peace with operations of war. The\r\nalien and sedition acts have already operated in the south as powerful\r\nsedatives of the X. Y. Z. inflammation. In your quarter, where violations\r\nof principle are either less regarded or more concealed, the direct tax is\r\nlikely to have the same effect, and to excite inquiries into the object of\r\nthe enormous expenses and taxes we are bringing on. And your information\r\nsupervening, that we might have a liberal accommodation if we would, there\r\ncan be little doubt of the reproduction of that general movement which had\r\nbeen changed, for a moment, by the despatches of October 22d. And though\r\nsmall checks and stops, like Logan's pretended embassy, may be thrown in\r\nthe way from time to time, and may a little retard its motion, yet the\r\ntide is already turned, and will sweep before it all the feeble obstacles\r\nof art. The unquestionable republicanism of the American mind will break\r\nthrough the mist under which it has been clouded, and will oblige its\r\nagents to reform the principles and practices of their administration.\r\n\r\nYou suppose that you have been abused by both parties. As far as has\r\ncome to my knowledge, you are misinformed. I have never seen or heard a\r\nsentence of blame uttered against you by the republicans; unless we were\r\nso to construe their wishes that you had more boldly co-operated in a\r\nproject of a treaty, and would more explicitly state, whether there was\r\nin your colleagues that flexibility, which persons earnest after peace\r\nwould have practised? Whether, on the contrary, their demeanor was not\r\ncold, reserved, and distant, at least, if not backward? And whether, if\r\nthey had yielded to those informal conferences which Talleyrand seems to\r\nhave courted, the liberal accommodation you suppose might not have been\r\neffected, even with their agency? Your fellow-citizens think they have a\r\nright to full information, in a case of such great concernment to them.\r\nIt is their sweat which is to earn all the expenses of the war, and their\r\nblood which is to flow in expiation of the causes of it. It may be in\r\nyour power to save them from these miseries by full communications and\r\nunrestrained details, postponing motives of delicacy to those of duty. It\r\nrests with you to come forward independently; to make your stand on the\r\nhigh ground of your own character; to disregard calumny, and to be borne\r\nabove it on the shoulders of your grateful fellow citizens; or to sink\r\ninto the humble oblivion, to which the federalists (self-called) have\r\nsecretly condemned you; and even to be happy if they will indulge you\r\noblivion, while they have beamed on your colleagues meridian splendor.\r\nPardon me, my dear Sir, if my expressions are strong. My feelings are so\r\nmuch more so, that it is with difficulty I reduce them even to the tone\r\nI use. If you doubt the dispositions towards you, look into the papers,\r\non both sides, for the toasts which were given throughout the States on\r\nthe fourth of July. You will there see whose hearts were with you, and\r\nwhose were ulcerated against you. Indeed, as soon as it was known that\r\nyou had consented to stay in Paris, there was no measure observed in the\r\nexecrations of the war party. They openly wished you might be guillotined,\r\nor sent to Cayenne, or anything else. And these expressions were finally\r\nstifled from a principle of policy only, and to prevent you from being\r\nurged to a justification of yourself. From this principle alone proceed\r\nthe silence and cold respect they observe towards you. Still, they\r\ncannot prevent at times the flames bursting from under the embers, as\r\nMr. Pickering's letters, report, and conversations testify, as well as\r\nthe indecent expressions respecting you, indulged by some of them in the\r\ndebate on these despatches. These sufficiently show that you are never\r\nmore to be honored or trusted by them, and that they wait to crush you for\r\never, only till they can do it without danger to themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen I sat down to answer your letter, but two courses presented\r\nthemselves, either to say nothing or everything; for half confidences are\r\nnot in my character. I could not hesitate which was due to you. I have\r\nunbosomed myself fully; and it will certainly be highly gratifying if I\r\nreceive like confidence from you. For even if we differ in principle more\r\nthan I believe we do, you and I know too well the texture of the human\r\nmind, and the slipperiness of human reason, to consider differences of\r\nopinion otherwise than differences of form or feature. Integrity of views\r\nmore than their soundness, is the basis of esteem. I shall follow your\r\ndirection in conveying this by a private hand; though I know not as yet\r\nwhen one worthy of confidence will occur. And my trust in you leaves me\r\nwithout a fear that this letter, meant as a confidential communication\r\nof my impressions, will ever go out of your own hand, or be suffered\r\nin anywise to commit my name. Indeed, besides the accidents which might\r\nhappen to it even under your care, considering the accident of death to\r\nwhich you are liable, I think it safest to pray you, after reading it as\r\noften as you please, to destroy at least the second and third leaves. The\r\nfirst contains principles only, which I fear not to avow; but the second\r\nand third contain facts stated for your information, and which, though\r\nsacredly conformable to my firm belief, yet would be galling to some,\r\nand expose me to illiberal attacks. I therefore repeat my prayer to burn\r\nthe second and third leaves. And did we ever expect to see the day, when,\r\nbreathing nothing but sentiments of love to our country and its freedom\r\nand happiness, our correspondence must be as secret as if we were hatching\r\nits destruction! Adieu, my friend, and accept my sincere and affectionate\r\nsalutations. I need not add my signature.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDMUND PENDLETON.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 29, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your patriarchal address to your country is running through all\r\nthe republican papers, and has a very great effect on the people. It is\r\nshort, simple, and presents things in a view they readily comprehend. The\r\ncharacter and circumstances too of the writer leave them without doubts\r\nof his motives. If, like the patriarch of old, you had but one blessing\r\nto give us, I should have wished it directed to a particular object. But\r\nI hope you have one for this also. You know what a wicked use has been\r\nmade of the French negotiation; and particularly the X. Y. Z. dish cooked\r\nup by * * * * *, where the swindlers are made to appear as the French\r\ngovernment. Art and industry combined, have certainly wrought out of this\r\nbusiness a wonderful effect on the people. Yet they have been astonished\r\nmore than they have understood it, and now that Gerry's correspondence\r\ncomes out, clearing the French government of that turpitude, and showing\r\nthem \"sincere in their dispositions for peace, not wishing us to break the\r\nBritish treaty, and willing to arrange a liberal one with us,\" the people\r\nwill be disposed to suspect they have been duped. But these communications\r\nare too voluminous for them, and beyond their reach. A recapitulation\r\nis now wanting of the whole story, stating every thing according to what\r\nwe may now suppose to have been the truth, short, simple and levelled to\r\nevery capacity. Nobody in America can do it so well as yourself, in the\r\nsame character of the father of your country, or any form you like better,\r\nand so concise, as omitting nothing material, may yet be printed in hand\r\nbills, of which we could print and disperse ten or twelve thousand copies\r\nunder letter covers, through all the United States, by the members of\r\nCongress when they return home. If the understanding of the people could\r\nbe rallied to the truth on this subject, by exposing the dupery practised\r\non them, there are so many other things about to bear on them favorably\r\nfor the resurrection of their republican spirit, that a reduction of the\r\nadministration to constitutional principles cannot fail to be the effect.\r\nThese are the alien and sedition laws, the vexations of the stamp act,\r\nthe disgusting particularities of the direct tax, the additional army\r\nwithout an enemy, and recruiting officers lounging at every Court House\r\nto decoy the laborer from his plough, a navy of fifty ships, five millions\r\nto be raised to build it, on the usurious interest of eight per cent., the\r\nperseverance in war on our part, when the French government shows such an\r\nanxious desire to keep at peace with us, taxes of ten millions now paid by\r\nfour millions of people, and yet a necessity, in a year or two, of raising\r\nfive millions more for annual expenses. These things will immediately\r\nbe bearing on the public mind, and if it remain not still blinded by a\r\nsupposed necessity, for the purposes of maintaining our independence and\r\ndefending our country, they will set things to rights. I hope you will\r\nundertake this statement. If anybody else had possessed your happy talent\r\nfor this kind of recapitulation, I would have been the last to disturb\r\nyou with the application; but it will really be rendering our country a\r\nservice greater than it is in the power of any other individual to render.\r\nTo save you the trouble of hunting the several documents from which this\r\nstatement is to be taken, I have collected them here completely, and\r\nenclose them to you.\r\n\r\nLogan's bill has passed. On this subject, it is hardly necessary for me to\r\ndeclare to you, on everything sacred, that the part they ascribed to me\r\nwas entirely a calumny. Logan called on me, four or five days before his\r\ndeparture, and asked and received a certificate (in my private capacity)\r\nof his citizenship and circumstances of life, merely as a protection,\r\nshould he be molested in the present turbulent state of Europe. I have\r\ngiven such to an hundred others, and they have been much more frequently\r\nasked and obtained by tories than whigs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccept my sincere prayers for long and happy years to you still, and my\r\naffectionate salutations and adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL N. LEWIS.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Believing that the letters of Messrs. Gerry and Talleyrand,\r\nwill give you pleasure to peruse, I send you a copy; you will perceive\r\nby them the anxiety of the Government of France for a reconciliation\r\nwith us, and Mr. Gerry's belief of their sincerity, and that they were\r\nready to have made a liberal treaty with us. You will also see by Mr.\r\nPickering's report that we are determined to believe no declarations\r\nthey can make, but to meet their peaceable professions with acts of\r\nwar. An act has passed the House of Representatives by a majority of\r\ntwenty, for continuing the law cutting off intercourse with France, but\r\nallowing the President by proclamation, to except out of this such parts\r\nof their dominions as disavow the depredations committed on us. This is\r\nintended for St. Domingo, where Toussaint has thrown off dependence on\r\nFrance. He has an agent here on this business. Yesterday, the House of\r\nRepresentatives voted six ships of 74 guns and six of 18, making 552 guns.\r\nThese would cost in England $5,000 a gun. They would cost here $10,000,\r\nso the whole will cost five and a half millions of dollars. Their annual\r\nexpense is stated at £1,000 Virginia money a gun, being a little short of\r\ntwo millions of dollars. And this is only a part of what is proposed; the\r\nwhole contemplated being twelve 74's, 12 frigates and about 25 smaller\r\nvessels. The state of our income and expense is (in round numbers) nearly\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nImports seven and a half millions of dollars; excise, auctions, licenses,\r\ncarriages half a million; postage, patents, and bank stock, one-eighth of\r\na million, making eight and one-eighth millions. To these the direct tax\r\nand stamp tax will add two millions clear of expense, making in the whole\r\nten and one-eighth millions. The expenses on the civil list, three-fourths\r\nof a million, foreign intercourse half a million, interest on the public\r\ndebt four millions, the present navy two and a half millions, the present\r\narmy one and a half millions, making nine and one-quarter millions. The\r\nadditional army will be two and a half millions, the additional navy\r\nthree millions, and interest on the new loan near one-half a million, in\r\nall, fifteen and one-quarter millions; so in about a year or two there\r\nwill be five millions annually to be raised by taxes in addition to the\r\nten millions we now pay. Suppose our population is now five millions,\r\nthis would be three dollars a head. This is exclusive of the outfit of\r\nthe navy, for which a loan is opened to borrow five millions at eight\r\nper cent. If we can remain at peace, we have this in our favor, that\r\nthese projects will require time to execute; that in the meantime, the\r\nsentiments of the people in the middle States are visibly turning back\r\nto their former direction, the X. Y. Z. delusion being abated, and their\r\nminds become sensible to the circumstances surrounding them, to wit: the\r\nalien and sedition acts, the vexations of the stamp act, the direct tax,\r\nthe follies of the additional army and navy money borrowed for these at\r\nthe usurious interest of eight per cent., and Mr. Gerry's communications\r\nshowing that peace is ours unless we throw it away. But if the joining\r\nthe revolted subjects (negroes) of France, and surrounding _their_ islands\r\nwith our armed vessels, instead of their merely cruising on our own coasts\r\nto protect our own commerce, should provoke France to a declaration of\r\nwar, these measures will become irremediable.\r\n\r\nThe English and German papers are killing and eating Bonaparte every day.\r\nHe is, however, safe; has effected a peaceable establishment of government\r\nin Egypt, the inhabitants of which have preferred him to their mameluke\r\nGovernors, and the expectation is renewed of his march to India. In that\r\ncountry great preparations are made for the overthrow of the English\r\npower. The insurrection of Ireland seems to be reduced low. The peace\r\nbetween France and the Empire seems also to be doubtful. Very little is\r\napprehended for them from anything which the Turks and Russians can do\r\nagainst them. I wish I could have presented you with a more comfortable\r\nview of our affairs. However, that will come if the friends of reform,\r\nwhile they remain firm, avoid every act and threat against the peace of\r\nthe Union, that would check the favorable sentiments of the Middle States,\r\nand rally them again around the measures which are ruining us. Reason,\r\nnot rashness, is the only means of bringing our fellow citizens to their\r\ntrue minds. Present my best complements to Mrs. Lewis, and accept yourself\r\nassurances of the sincere and affectionate esteem with which I am, dear\r\nSir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 30, 1799.\r\n\r\nMy last to you was of the 16th, since which yours of the 12th is received,\r\nand its contents disposed of properly. These met such approbation as to\r\nhave occasioned an extraordinary impression of that day's paper. Logan's\r\nbill is passed. The lower house, by a majority of twenty, passed yesterday\r\na bill continuing the suspension of intercourse with France, with a new\r\nclause enabling the President to admit intercourse with the rebellious\r\nnegroes under Toussaint, who has an agent here, and has thrown off\r\ndependence on France. The House of Representatives have also voted six\r\n74's and six 18's, in part of the additional navy, say 552 guns, which in\r\nEngland would cost $5,000, and here $10,000, consequently more than the\r\nwhole five millions for which a loan is now opened at eight per cent. The\r\nmaintenance is estimated at £1,000 (lawful) a gun annually. A bill has\r\nbeen this day brought into the Senate for authorizing the President _in\r\ncase of a declaration of war or danger of invasion by any European power_,\r\nto raise an _eventual_ army of thirty regiments, infantry, cavalry, and\r\nartillery in addition to the additional army, the provisional army,\r\nand the corps of volunteers, which last he is authorized to brigade,\r\nofficer, exercise, and pay during the time of exercise. And all this\r\nnotwithstanding Gerry's correspondence received, and demonstrating the\r\naversion of France to consider us as enemies. All depends on her patiently\r\nstanding the measures of the present session, and the surrounding _her_\r\nislands with our cruisers, and capturing their armed vessels on her own\r\ncoasts. If this is borne awhile, the public opinion is most manifestly\r\nwavering in the middle States, and was even before the publication of\r\nGerry's correspondence. In New York, Jersey, and Pennsylvania, every\r\none attests them, and General Sumpter, just arrived, assures me the\r\nrepublicans of South Carolina have gained fifty per cent. in numbers since\r\nthe election, which was in the moment of the X. Y. Z. fever. I believe\r\nthere is no doubt the Republican Governor would be elected here now, and\r\nstill less for next October. The gentleman of North Carolina seems to\r\nbe satisfied that their new delegation will furnish but three, perhaps\r\nonly two anti-republicans; if so, we shall be gainer on the whole. But\r\nit is on the progress of public opinion we are to depend for rectifying\r\nthe proceedings of the next Congress. The only question is whether this\r\nwill not carry things beyond the reach of rectification. Petitions and\r\nremonstrances against the alien and sedition laws are coming from various\r\nparts of New York, Jersey, and Pennsylvania: some of them very well drawn.\r\nI am in hopes Virginia will stand so countenanced by those States as\r\nto express the wishes of the Government to coerce her, which they might\r\nventure on if they supposed she would be left alone. Firmness on our part,\r\nbut a passive firmness, is the true course. Anything rash or threatening\r\nmight check the favorable dispositions of these middle States, and rally\r\nthem again around the measures which are ruining us. Bonaparte appears to\r\nhave settled Egypt peacefully, and with the consent of those inhabitants,\r\nand seems to be looking towards the East Indies, where a most formidable\r\nco-operation has been prepared for demolishing the British power. I wish\r\nthe affairs of Ireland were as hopeful, and the peace with the north\r\nof Europe. Nothing new here as to the price of tobacco, the river not\r\nhaving yet admitted the bringing any to this market. Spain being entirely\r\nopen for ours, and depending on it for her supplies during the cutting\r\noff of her intercourse with her own colonies by the superiority of the\r\nBritish at sea, is much in our favor. I forgot to add that the bill for\r\nthe _eventual_ army, authorizes the President to borrow two millions\r\nmore. Present my best respects to Mrs. Madison, health and affectionate\r\nsalutations to yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, February 5, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 30th of January; since which yours of\r\nthe 25th has been received.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bill for continuing the suspension of intercourse with France and\r\nher dependencies, is still before the Senate, but will pass by a very\r\ngreat vote. An attack is made on what is called the Toussaint's clause,\r\nthe object of which, as is charged by the one party and _admitted_ by\r\nthe other, is to facilitate the separation of the island from France.\r\nThe clause will pass, however, by about nineteen to eight, or perhaps\r\neighteen to nine. Rigaud, at the head of the people of color, maintains\r\nhis allegiance. But they are only twenty-five thousand souls, against five\r\nhundred thousand, the number of the blacks. The treaty made with them by\r\nMaitland is (if they are to be separated from France) the best thing for\r\nus. They must get their provisions from us. It will indeed be in English\r\nbottoms, so that we shall lose the carriage. But the English will probably\r\nforbid them the ocean, confine them to their island, and thus prevent\r\ntheir becoming an American Algiers. It must be admitted too, that they may\r\nplay them off on us when they please. Against this there is no remedy but\r\ntimely measures on our part, to clear ourselves, by degrees, of the matter\r\non which that lever can work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA piece published in Bache's paper on _foreign influence_, has the\r\ngreatest currency and effect. To an extraordinary first impression, they\r\nhave been obliged to make a second, and of an extraordinary number. It\r\nis such things as these the public want. They say so from all quarters,\r\nand that they wish to hear reason instead of _disgusting blackguardism_.\r\nThe public sentiment being now on the creen, and many heavy circumstances\r\nabout to fall into the republican scale, we are sensible that this summer\r\nis the season for systematic energies and sacrifices. The engine is the\r\npress. Every man must lay his purse and his pen under contribution. As\r\nto the former, it is possible I may be obliged to assume something for\r\nyou. As to the latter, let me pray and beseech you to set apart a certain\r\nportion of every post day to write what may be proper for the public. Send\r\nit to me while here, and when I go away I will let you know to whom you\r\nmay send, so that your name shall be sacredly secret. You can render such\r\nincalculable services in this way, as to lessen the effect of our loss of\r\nyour presence here. I shall see you on the 5th or 6th of March.\r\n\r\nAffectionate salutations to Mrs. Madison and yourself. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 11, 1799.\r\n\r\nI wrote you last on the 22d of January, since which yours of January\r\n26th is received. A bill will pass the Senate to day for enabling the\r\nPresident to retaliate rigorously on any French citizens who now are or\r\nhereafter may be in our power, should they put to death any sailors of\r\nours _forced_ on board British vessels and taken by the French. This is\r\nfounded expressly on their _Arret_ of October 29th, 1798, communicated\r\nby the President by message. It is known (from the Secretary of State\r\nhimself) that he received, immediately after, a letter from Rufus King\r\ninforming him the _Arret_ was suspended, and it has been known a week\r\nthat we were passing a retaliating act founded expressly on that _Arret_,\r\nyet the President has not communicated it, and the supporters of the\r\nbill, who themselves told the secret of the suspension in debate, (for\r\nit was otherwise unknown,) will yet pass the bill. We have already an\r\nexisting army of 5,000 men, and the additional army of 9,000 now going\r\ninto execution. We have a bill on its progress through the Senate for\r\nauthorizing the President to raise thirty regiments (30,000 men) called an\r\n_eventual_ army, in case of war with any European power, or of imminent\r\ndanger of invasion from them _in his opinion_. And also to call out\r\nand exercise at times the _volunteer_ army, the number of which we know\r\nnot. Six 74's and six 18's, making up 500 guns (in part of the fleet of\r\ntwelve 74's, twelve frigates, and 20 or 30 smaller vessels proposed to\r\nbe built or bought as soon as we can), are now to be begun. One million\r\nof dollars is voted. The Government estimate of their cost is about\r\n4,500 dollars (£1000 sterling) a gun. But there cannot be a doubt they\r\nwill cost 10,000 dollars a gun, and consequently the 550 guns will be\r\n5½ millions. A loan is now opened for five millions at eight per cent.,\r\nand the _eventual_ army bill authorizes another of two millions. King\r\nis appointed to negotiate a treaty of commerce with Russia, in London.\r\nPhocion Smith is _proposed_ to go to Constantinople to make a treaty with\r\nthe Turks. Under two other covers you will receive a copy of the French\r\noriginals of Gerry's communications for yourself, and a dozen of G. N's\r\npamphlets on the laws of the last session. I wish you to give these to\r\nthe most influential characters among our countrymen, who are only misled,\r\nare candid enough to be open to conviction, and who may have most effect\r\non their neighbors. It would be useless to give them to persons already\r\nsound. Do not let my name be connected in the business. It is agreed on\r\nall hands that the British depredations have greatly exceeded the French\r\nduring the last six months. The insurance companies at Boston, this place\r\nand Baltimore, prove this from their books. I have not heard how it is at\r\nNew York. The Senate struck out of the bill continuing the suspension of\r\nintercourse with France, the clauses which authorized the President to do\r\nit with certain other countries (say Spanish and Dutch), which clauses had\r\npassed the House of Representatives by a majority of, I believe, twenty.\r\nThey agreed, however, to the amendment of the Senate. But Toussaint's\r\nclause was retained by both Houses. Adieu affectionately.\r\n\r\nFeb. 12th. The vessel called the Retaliation, formerly French property\r\ntaken by us, armed and sent to cruise on them, retaken by them and carried\r\ninto Guadaloupe, arrived here this morning with her own captain and crew,\r\n&c. They say that new commissioners from France arrived at Guadaloupe,\r\nsent Victor Hughes home in irons, liberated the crew, said to the captain\r\nthat they found him to be an officer bearing a regular commission from the\r\nUnited States, possessed of a vessel called the Retaliation, then in their\r\nport; that they should inquire into no preceding fact, and that he was\r\nfree with his vessel and crew to depart; that as to differences with the\r\nUnited States, commissioners were coming out from France to settle them;\r\nin the meantime, no injury should be done to us or our citizens. This was\r\nknown to every Senator when we met. The Retaliation bill came on, on its\r\npassage, and was passed with only two dissenting voices, two or three who\r\nwould have dissented happening to be absent.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. STEWART.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 13, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I avoid writing to my friends because the fidelity of the\r\npost office is very much doubted. I will give you briefly a statement of\r\nwhat we have done and are doing. The following is a view of our finances\r\nin round numbers. The import brings in the last year seven and a half\r\nmillions of dollars, the excise, carriages, auctions, and licenses, half\r\na million, the residuary small articles one-eighth of a million. It is\r\nexpected that the stamp act may pay the expense of the direct tax, so\r\nthat the two may be counted at two millions, making in the whole ten and\r\none-eighth millions. Our expenses for the civil list three-quarters of\r\na million, foreign intercourse half a million (this includes Indian and\r\nAlgerine expenses, the Spanish and British treaties), interest of the\r\npublic debt four millions, the existing navy two and a half millions,\r\nthe existing army, 5,000 men, one and a half millions, making nine and\r\na quarter millions, so that we have a surplus of near a million. But the\r\nadditional army, 9,000 men, now raising, will add two and a half millions\r\nannually, the additional navy proposed three millions, and the interest of\r\nthe new loans half a million, making six millions more, so that as soon\r\nas the army and navy shall be ready, our whole expenses will be fifteen\r\nmillions; consequently, there will be five millions annually more to\r\nbe raised by taxes. Our present taxes of ten millions are two dollars a\r\nhead on our present population, and the future five millions will make it\r\nthree dollars. Our whole exports (native) this year are 28,192, so that\r\nour taxes are now a third and will soon be half of our whole exports;\r\nand when you add the expenses of the State Governments we shall be found\r\nto have got to the plenum of taxation in ten short years of peace. Great\r\nBritain, after centuries of wars and revolutions, had at the commencement\r\nof the present war taxed only to the amount of two-thirds of her exports.\r\nWe have opened a loan for five millions, at eight per cent. interest, and\r\nanother is proposed of two millions. These are to build six seventy-fours\r\nand six eighteens, in part of additional navy, for which a bill passed the\r\nHouse of Representatives two days ago, by fifty-four against forty-two.\r\nBesides the existing army of 5,000 and additional army of 9,000, an\r\n_eventual_ army of 30,000 is proposed to be raised by the President, in\r\ncase of invasion by any European power, or danger of invasion, _in his\r\nopinion_, and the _volunteer_ army, the amount of which we know not, is to\r\nbe immediately called out and exercised at the public expense. For these\r\npurposes a bill has been twice read and committed in the Senate. You have\r\nseen by Gerry's communications that France is _sincerely anxious_ for\r\nreconciliation, willing to give us a _liberal_ treaty, and does not wish\r\nus to break the British treaty, but only to put her on an equal footing.\r\nA further proof of her sincerity turned up yesterday. We had taken an\r\narmed vessel from her, had refitted and sent her to cruise against them,\r\nunder the name of the Retaliation, and they re-captured and sent her\r\ninto Guadaloupe. The new commissioners arriving there from France, sent\r\nVictor Hughes off in irons, and said to our captain, that as they found\r\nhim bearing a regular commission as an officer of the United States, with\r\nhis vessel in their port, and his crew, they would inquire into no fact\r\nrespecting the vessel preceding their arrival, but that he, his vessel\r\nand crew, were free to depart. They arrived here yesterday. The federal\r\npapers call her a _cartel_. It is whispered that the executive means\r\nto return an equal number of the French prisoners, and this may give a\r\ncolor to call her a cartel, but she was liberated freely and without\r\ncondition. The commissioners further said to the captain that, as to\r\nthe differences with the United States, new commissioners were coming\r\nout from France to settle them, and in the meantime they should do us\r\nno injury. The President has appointed Rufus King to make a commercial\r\ntreaty with the Russians in London, and William Smith, of South Carolina,\r\nto go to Constantinople to make one with the Turks. Both appointments are\r\nconfirmed by the Senate. A little dissatisfaction was expressed by some\r\nthat we should never have treated with them till the moment when they\r\nhad formed a coalition with the English against the French. You have seen\r\nthat the Directory had published an arret declaring they would treat as\r\npirates any neutrals they should take in the ships of their enemies. The\r\nPresident communicated this to Congress as soon as he received it. A bill\r\nwas brought into Senate reciting that arret, and authorizing retaliation.\r\nThe President received information almost in the same instant that the\r\nDirectory had suspended the arret (which fact was privately declared by\r\nthe Secretary of State to two of the Senate), and, though it was known we\r\nwere passing an act founded on that arret, yet the President has never\r\ncommunicated the suspension. However the Senate, informed indirectly of\r\nthe fact, still passed the act yesterday, an hour after we had heard of\r\nthe return of our vessel and crew before mentioned. It is acknowledged\r\non all hands, and declared by the insurance companies that the British\r\ndepredations during the last six months have greatly exceeded the French,\r\nyet not a word is said about it officially. However, all these things\r\nare working on the public mind. They are getting back to the point where\r\nthey were when the X. Y. Z. story was passed off on them. A wonderful\r\nand rapid change is taking place in Pennsylvania, Jersey, and New York.\r\nCongress is daily plied with petitions against the alien and sedition\r\nlaws and standing armies. Several parts of this State are so violent\r\nthat we fear an insurrection. This will be brought about by some if they\r\ncan. It is the only thing we have to fear. The appearance of an attack\r\nof force against the government would check the present current of the\r\nmiddle States, and rally them around the government; whereas, if suffered\r\nto go on, it will pass on to a reformation of abuses. The materials now\r\nbearing on the public mind will infallibly restore it to its republican\r\nsoundness in the course of the present summer, if the knowledge of facts\r\ncan only be disseminated among the people. Under separate cover you will\r\nreceive some pamphlets written by George Nicholas on the acts of the last\r\nsession. These I would wish you to distribute, not to sound men who have\r\nno occasion for them, but to such as have been misled, are candid and\r\nwill be open to the conviction of truth, and are of influence among their\r\nneighbors. It is the sick who need medicine, and not the well. Do not\r\nlet my name appear in the matter. Perhaps I shall forward you some other\r\nthings to be distributed in the same way. Present me respectfully to Mrs.\r\nStuart, and accept assurances of the sincere esteem of, dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDMUND PENDLETON.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 14, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you a petition on the 29th of January. I know the\r\nextent of this trespass on your tranquillity, and how indiscreet it would\r\nhave been under any other circumstances. But the fate of this country,\r\nwhether it shall be irretrievably plunged into a form of government\r\nrejected by the makers of the Constitution, or shall get back to the true\r\nprinciples of that instrument, depends on the turn which things may take\r\nwithin a short period of time ensuing the present moment. The violations\r\nof the Constitution, propensities to war, to expense, and to a particular\r\nforeign connection, which we have lately seen, are becoming evident to\r\nthe people, and are dispelling that mist which X. Y. Z. had spread before\r\ntheir eyes. This State is coming forward with a boldness not yet seen.\r\nEven the German counties of York and Lancaster, hitherto the most devoted,\r\nhave come about, and by petitions with four thousand signers remonstrate\r\nagainst the alien and sedition laws, standing armies, and discretionary\r\npowers in the President. New York and Jersey are also getting into great\r\nagitation. In this State, we fear that the ill designing may produce\r\ninsurrection. Nothing could be so fatal. Anything like force would check\r\nthe progress of the public opinion and rally them round the government.\r\nThis is not the kind of opposition the American people will permit. But\r\nkeep away all show of force, and they will bear down the evil propensities\r\nof the government, by the constitutional means of election and petition.\r\nIf we can keep quiet, therefore, the tide now turning will take a steady\r\nand proper direction. Even in New Hampshire there are strong symptoms of\r\na rising inquietude. In this state of things, my dear Sir, it is more in\r\nyour power than any other man's in the United States, to give the _coup de\r\ngrace_ to the ruinous principles and practices we have seen. In hopes you\r\nhave consented to it, I shall furnish to you some additional matter which\r\nhas arisen since my last.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a part of a speech of Mr. Gallatin on the naval bill. The\r\nviews he takes of our finances, and of the policy of our undertaking to\r\nestablish a great navy, may furnish some hints. I am told something on\r\nthe same subject from Mr. J. Nicholas will appear in the Richmond and\r\nFredericksburg papers. I mention the real author, that you may respect it\r\nduly, for I presume it will be anonymous. The residue of Gallatin's speech\r\nshall follow when published. A recent fact, proving the anxiety of France\r\nfor a reconciliation with us, is the following. You know that one of the\r\narmed vessels which we took from her was refitted by us, sent to cruise\r\nagainst her, recaptured, and carried into Guadaloupe under the name of the\r\nRetaliation. On the arrival there of Desfourneaux, the new commissioner,\r\nhe sent Victor Hughes home in irons; called up our captain; told him that\r\nhe found he had a regular commission as an officer of the United States;\r\nthat his vessel was then lying in the harbor; that he should inquire\r\ninto no fact preceding his own arrival (by this he avoided noticing that\r\nthe vessel was really French property) and that therefore, himself and\r\ncrew were free to depart with their vessel; that as to the differences\r\nbetween France and the United States, commissioners were coming out to\r\nsettle them, and in the meantime, no injury should be done on their part.\r\nThe captain insisted on being a prisoner; the other disclaimed; and so\r\nhe arrived here with vessel and crew the day before yesterday. Within an\r\nhour after this was known to the Senate, they passed a retaliation bill,\r\nof which I enclose you a copy. This was the more remarkable, as the bill\r\nwas founded expressly on the _Arret_ of October the 29th, which had been\r\ncommunicated by the President as soon as received, and he remarked, \"that\r\nit could not be too soon communicated to the two Houses and the public.\"\r\nYet he almost in the same instant received, through the same channel,\r\nMr. King's information that that _Arret_ was suspended, and though he\r\nknew we were making it the foundation of a retaliation bill, he has never\r\nyet communicated it. But the Senate knew the fact informally from the\r\nSecretary of State, and knowing it, passed the bill.\r\n\r\nThe President has appointed, and the Senate approved Rufus King, to\r\nenter into a treaty of commerce with the Russians, at London, and William\r\nSmith, (Phocion) Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary, to go\r\nto Constantinople to make one with the Turks. So that as soon as there\r\nis a coalition of Turks, Russians and English, against France, we seize\r\nthat moment to countenance it as openly as we dare, by treaties, which\r\nwe never had with them before. All this helps to fill up the measure of\r\nprovocation towards France, and to get from them a declaration of war,\r\nwhich we are afraid to be the first in making. It is certain the French\r\nhave behaved atrociously towards neutral nations, and us particularly;\r\nand though we might be disposed not to charge them with all the enormities\r\ncommitted in their name in the West Indies, yet they are to be blamed for\r\nnot doing more to prevent them. A just and rational censure ought to be\r\nexpressed on them, while we disapprove the constant billingsgate poured\r\non them _officially_. It is at the same time true, that their enemies set\r\nthe first example of violating neutral rights, and continue it to this\r\nday; insomuch, that it is declared on all hands, and particularly by the\r\ninsurance companies and denied by none, that the British spoliations have\r\nconsiderably exceeded the French during the last six months. Yet not a\r\nword of these things is said officially to the Legislature.\r\n\r\nStill further, to give the devil his due, (the French) it should be\r\nobserved that it has been said without contradiction, and the people made\r\nto believe, that their refusal to receive our Envoys was contrary to the\r\nlaw of nations, and a sufficient cause of war; whereas, every one who\r\never read a book on the law of nations knows, that it is an unquestionable\r\nright in every power to refuse to receive any minister who is personally\r\ndisagreeable. Martens, the latest and a very respected writer, has laid\r\nthis down so clearly and shortly in his \"summary of the law of nations,\"\r\nB. 7. ch. 2. sec. 9, that I will transcribe the passage verbatim. \"Section\r\n9. Of choice in the person of the minister. The choice of the person to be\r\nsent as minister depends of right on the sovereign who sends him, leaving\r\nthe right, however, of him to whom he is sent, of refusing to acknowledge\r\nany one, to whom he has a personal dislike, or who is inadmissible by the\r\nlaws and usages of the country.\" And he adds notes proving by instances,\r\n&c. This is the whole section.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these appearances of peace from France, we are,\r\nbesides our _existing_ army of five thousand men, and an _additional_\r\narmy of nine thousand (now officered and levying), passing a bill for an\r\n_eventual_ army of thirty regiments (thirty thousand) and for regimenting,\r\nbrigading, officering and exercising _at the public expense_ our\r\n_volunteer_ army, the amount of which we know not. I enclose you a copy\r\nof the bill, which has been twice read and committed in Senate. To meet\r\nthis expense, and that of the six seventy-four's and six eighteen's, part\r\nof the proposed fleet, we have opened a loan of five millions at eight per\r\ncent., and authorize another of two millions; and at the same time, every\r\nman voting for these measures acknowledges there is no probability of an\r\ninvasion by France. While speaking of the restoration of our vessel, I\r\nomitted to add, that it is said that our government contemplate restoring\r\nthe Frenchmen taken originally in the same vessel, and kept at Lancaster\r\nas prisoners. This has furnished the idea of calling her a _cartel_\r\nvessel, and pretending that she came as such for an exchange of prisoners,\r\nwhich is false. She was delivered free and without condition, but it does\r\nnot suit to let any new evidence appear of the desire of conciliation in\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nI believe it is now certain that the commissioners on the British debts\r\ncan proceed together no longer. I am told that our two have prepared\r\na long report, which will perhaps be made public. The result will be,\r\nthat we must recur again to negotiation, to settle the principles of the\r\nBritish claims. You know that Congress rises on the 3d of March, and that\r\nif you have acceded to my prayers, I should hear from you at least a week\r\nbefore our rising. Accept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of\r\nthe sincere esteem with which I am, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 19, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you last on the 11th; yesterday the bill for the\r\n_eventual_ army of thirty regiments (thirty thousand) and seventy-five\r\nthousand volunteers, passed the Senate. By an amendment, the President was\r\nauthorized to use the volunteers for every purpose for which he can use\r\nmilitia, so that the militia are rendered completely useless. The friends\r\nof the bill acknowledged that the volunteers are a _militia_, and agreed\r\nthat they might properly be called the \"Presidential militia.\" They are\r\nnot to go out of their State without their own consent. Consequently,\r\nall service out of the State is thrown on the constitutional militia, the\r\nPresidential militia being exempted from doing duty with them. Leblane,\r\nan agent from Desfourneaux of Guadaloupe, came in the Retaliation. You\r\nwill see in the papers Desfourneaux's letter to the President, which\r\nwill correct some immaterial circumstances of the statement in my last.\r\nYou will see the truth of the main fact, that the vessel and crew were\r\nliberated without condition. Notwithstanding this, they have obliged\r\nLeblane to receive the French prisoners, and to admit, in the papers,\r\nthe terms, \"in _exchange_ for _prisoners_ taken from us,\" he denying at\r\nthe same time that they consider them as _prisoners_, or had any idea of\r\n_exchange_. The object of his mission was not at all relative to that; but\r\nthey choose to keep up the idea of a cartel, to prevent the transaction\r\nfrom being used as evidence of the sincerity of the French government\r\ntowards a reconciliation. He came to assure us of a discontinuance of all\r\nirregularities in French privateers from Guadaloupe. He has been received\r\nvery cavalierly. In the meantime, a _consul general_ is named to St.\r\nDomingo; who may be considered as our minister to Toussaint.\r\n\r\nBut the event of events was announced to the Senate yesterday. It is this:\r\nit seems that soon after Gerry's departure, overtures must have been\r\nmade by Pichon, French charge d'affaires at the Hague, to Murray. They\r\nwere so soon matured, that on the 28th of September, 1798, Talleyrand\r\nwrites to Pichon, approving what had been done, and particularly of his\r\nhaving assured Murray that _whatever_ Plenipotentiary the government\r\nof the United States should send to France to end our differences would\r\nundoubtedly be received with the respect due to the representative of a\r\n_free, independent and powerful nation_; declaring that the President's\r\ninstructions to his Envoys at Paris, if they contain the whole of the\r\nAmerican government's intentions, announce dispositions which have been\r\nalways entertained by the Directory; and desiring him to communicate\r\nthese expressions to Murray, in order to convince him of the sincerity\r\nof the French government, and to prevail on him to transmit them to\r\nhis government. This is dated September the 28th, and may have been\r\nreceived by Pichon October the 1st; and nearly five months elapse before\r\nit is communicated. Yesterday, the President nominated to the Senate\r\nWilliam Vans Murray Minister Plenipotentiary to the French republic, and\r\nadded, that he shall be instructed not to go to France, without direct\r\nand unequivocal assurances from the French government that he shall\r\nbe received in character, enjoy the due privileges, and a minister of\r\nequal rank, title and power, be appointed to discuss and conclude our\r\ncontroversy by a new treaty. This had evidently been kept secret from the\r\nfederalists of both Houses, as appeared by their dismay. The Senate have\r\npassed over this day without taking it up. It is said they are graveled\r\nand divided; some are for opposing, others do not know what to do. But\r\nin the meantime, they have been permitted to go on with all the measures\r\nof war and patronage, and when the close of the session is at hand it is\r\nmade known. However, it silences all arguments against the sincerity of\r\nFrance, and renders desperate every further effort towards war. I enclose\r\nyou a paper with more particulars. Be so good as to keep it till you see\r\nme, and then return it, as it is the copy of one I sent to another person,\r\nand is the only copy I have. Since I began my letter I have received yours\r\nof February the 7th and 8th, with its enclosures; that referred to my\r\ndiscretion is precious, and shall be used accordingly.\r\n\r\nAffectionate salutations to Mrs. Madison and yourself, and adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. PENDLETON.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 19, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Since my last, which was of the 14th, a Monsieur Leblane, agent\r\nfrom Desfourneaux, has come to town. He came in the Retaliation, and a\r\nletter of Desfourneaux, of which he was the bearer, now enclosed, will\r\ncorrect some circumstances in my statement relative to that vessel which\r\nwere not very material. It shows, at the same time, that she was liberated\r\nwithout condition; still it is said (but I have no particular authority\r\nfor it) that he has been obliged to receive French prisoners here, and to\r\nadmit in the paper that the terms in exchange for _prisoners taken_ from\r\nus, should be used, he declaring, at the same time, that they had never\r\nconsidered ours as prisoners, nor had an idea of _exchange_. The object of\r\nhis mission was to assure the government against any future irregularities\r\nby privateers from Guadaloupe, and to open a friendly intercourse. He has\r\nbeen treated very cavalierly. I enclose you the President's message to\r\nthe House of Representatives relative to the suspension of the _Arret_, on\r\nwhich our retaliation bill is founded.\r\n\r\nA great event was presented yesterday. The President communicated a\r\nletter from Talleyrand to Pichon, French chargé des affaires at the Hague,\r\napproving of some overtures which had passed between him and Mr. Murray,\r\nand particularly of his having undertaken to assure Murray that _whatever_\r\nPlenipotentiary we might send to France to negotiate differences,\r\nshould be received with the respect due to the representative of a _free\r\nindependent and powerful nation_, and directing him to _prevail on Murray\r\nto_ transmit these assurances to his government. In consequence of this, a\r\nnomination of Mr. Murray, minister Plenipotentiary to the French republic,\r\nwas yesterday sent to the Senate. This renders their efforts for war\r\ndesperate, and silences all further denials of the sincerity of the French\r\ngovernment. I send you extracts from these proceedings for your more\r\nspecial information. I shall leave this the 2d day of March. Accept my\r\naffectionate salutations. Adieu.\r\n\r\nP. S. I should have mentioned that a nomination is before the Senate of\r\na _consul general_ to St. Domingo. It is understood that he will present\r\nhimself to Toussaint, and is, in fact, our minister to him.\r\n\r\n([Illustration: Pointing finger.] This is upon the margin of this letter.)\r\n\r\nThe face they will put on this business is, that they have frightened\r\nFrance into a respectful treatment. Whereas, in truth, France has been\r\nsensible that her measures to prevent the scandalous spectacle of war\r\nbetween the two republics, from the known impossibility of our injuring\r\nher, would not be imputed to her as a humiliation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 21, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND, * * * * *\r\n\r\nOn politics I must write sparingly, lest it should fall into the hands\r\nof persons who do not love either you or me. The wonderful irritation\r\nproduced in the minds of our citizens by the X. Y. Z. story, has in a\r\ngreat measure subsided. They begin to suspect and to see it coolly in\r\nits true light. Mr. Gerry's communications, with other information,\r\nprove to them that France is sincere in her wishes for reconciliation;\r\nand a recent proposition from that country, through Mr. Murray, puts the\r\nmatter out of doubt. What course the government will pursue, I know not.\r\nBut if we are left in peace, I have no doubt the wonderful turn in the\r\npublic opinion now manifestly taking place and rapidly increasing, will,\r\nin the course of this summer, become so universal and so weighty, that\r\nfriendship abroad and freedom at home will be firmly established by the\r\ninfluence and constitutional powers of the people at large. If we are\r\nforced into war, we must give up political differences of opinion, and\r\nunite as one man to defend our country. But whether at the close of such\r\na war, we should be as free as we are now, God knows. In fine, if war\r\ntakes place, republicanism has everything to fear; if peace, be assured\r\nthat your forebodings and my alarms will prove vain; and that the spirit\r\nof our citizens now rising as rapidly as it was then running crazy, and\r\nrising with a strength and majesty which show the loveliness of freedom,\r\nwill make this government in practice, what it is in principle, a model\r\nfor the protection of man in a state of _freedom_ and _order_. May heaven\r\nhave in store for your country a restoration of these blessings, and you\r\nbe destined as the instrument it will use for that purpose. But if this\r\nbe forbidden by fate, I hope we shall be able to preserve here an asylum\r\nwhere your love of liberty and disinterested patriotism will be forever\r\nprotected and honored, and where you will find, in the hearts of the\r\nAmerican people, a good portion of that esteem and affection which glow in\r\nthe bosom of the friend who writes this; and who, with sincere prayers for\r\nyour health, happiness and success, and cordial salutations, bids you, for\r\nthis time, adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHANCELLOR LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 23, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received with great pleasure your favor on the\r\nsubject of the steam engine. Though deterred by the complexity of that\r\nhitherto known, from making myself minutely acquainted with it, yet I am\r\nsufficiently acquainted with it to be sensible of the superior simplicity\r\nof yours, and its superior economy. I particularly thank you for the\r\npermission to communicate it to the Philosophical Society; and though\r\nthere will not be another session before I leave town, yet I have taken\r\ncare, by putting it into the hands of one of the Vice Presidents to-day,\r\nto have it presented at the next meeting. I lament the not receiving it a\r\nfortnight sooner, that it might have been inserted in a volume now closed,\r\nand to be published in a few days, before it would be possible for this\r\nengraving to be ready. There is one object to which I have often wished a\r\nsteam engine could be adopted. You know how desirable it is both in town\r\nand country to be able to have large reservoirs of water on the top of our\r\nhouses, not only for use (by pipes) in the apartments, but as a resource\r\nagainst fire. This last is most especially a desideratum in the country.\r\nWe might indeed have water carried from time to time in buckets to\r\ncisterns on the top of the house, but this is troublesome, and therefore\r\nwe never do it,--consequently are without resource when a fire happens.\r\nCould any agent be employed which would be little or no additional expense\r\nor trouble except the first purchase, it would be done. Every family has\r\nsuch an agent, its kitchen fire. It is small indeed, but if its small but\r\nconstant action could be accumulated so as to give a stroke from time to\r\ntime which might throw ever so small a quantity of water from the bottom\r\nof a well to the top of the house (say one hundred feet), it would furnish\r\nmore than would waste by evaporation, or be used by the family. I know\r\nnobody who must better know the value of such a machine than yourself, nor\r\nmore equal to the invention of it, and especially with your familiarity\r\nwith the subject. I have imagined that the iron back of the chimney\r\nmight be a cistern for holding the water, which should supply steam and\r\nwould be constantly kept in a boiling state by the ordinary fire. I wish\r\nthe subject may appear as interesting to you as it does to me, it would\r\nthen engage your attention, and we might hope this desideratum would be\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\nA want of confidence in the post office deters me from writing to my\r\nfriends on subject of politics. Indeed I am tired of writing Jeremiads on\r\nthat subject. What person, who remembers the times and tempers we have\r\nseen, would have believed that within so short a period, not only the\r\njealous spirit of liberty which shaped every operation of our revolution,\r\nbut even the common principles of English whigism would be scouted, and\r\nthe tory principle of passive obedience under the new-fangled names of\r\n_confidence_ and _responsibility_, become entirely triumphant? That the\r\ntories, whom in mercy we did not crumble to dust and ashes, could so\r\nhave entwined us in their scorpion tails, that we cannot now move hand\r\nor foot. But the spell is dissolving. The public mind is recovering from\r\nthe delirium into which it had been thrown, and we may still believe with\r\nsecurity that the great body of the American people must for ages yet be\r\nsubstantially republican. You have heard of the nomination of Mr. Murray.\r\nNot being in the secret of this juggle, I am not yet able to say how it is\r\nto be played off. Respectful and affectionate salutations from, dear Sir,\r\nyour sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 26, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was of the 19th; it acknowledged yours of\r\nthe 8th. In mine, I informed you of the nomination of Murray. There\r\nis evidence that the letter of Talleyrand was known to one of the\r\nSecretaries, therefore probably to all; the nomination, however, is\r\ndeclared by one of them to have been kept secret from them all. He added,\r\nthat he was glad of it, as, had they been consulted, the advice would have\r\nbeen against making the nomination. To the rest of the party, however, the\r\nwhole was a secret till the nomination was announced. Never did a party\r\nshow a stronger mortification, and consequently, that war had been their\r\nobject. Dana declared in debate (as I have from those who were present,)\r\nthat we had done everything which might provoke France to war; that we had\r\ngiven her insults which no nation ought to have borne; and yet she would\r\nnot declare war. The conjecture as to the executive is, that they received\r\nTalleyrand's letter before or about the meeting of Congress; that not\r\nmeaning to meet the overture effectually, they kept it secret, and let all\r\nthe war measures go on; but that just before the separation of the Senate,\r\nthe President, not thinking he could justify the concealing such an\r\noverture, nor indeed that it could be concealed, made a nomination, hoping\r\nthat his friends in the Senate would take on their own shoulders the\r\nodium of rejecting it; but they did not choose it. The Hamiltonians would\r\nnot, and the others could not, alone. The whole artillery of the phalanx,\r\ntherefore, was played secretly on the President, and he was obliged\r\nhimself to take a step which should parry the overture while it wears the\r\nface of acceding to it. (Mark that I state this as conjecture; but founded\r\non workings and indications which have been under our eyes.) Yesterday,\r\ntherefore, he sent in a nomination of Oliver Ellsworth, Patrick Henry and\r\nWilliam Vans Murray, Envoys Extraordinary and Ministers Plenipotentiary to\r\nthe French Republic, but declaring the two former should not leave this\r\ncountry till they should receive from the French Directory assurances\r\nthat they should be received with the respect due by the law of nations\r\nto their character, &c. This, if not impossible, must at least keep off\r\nthe day so hateful and so fatal to them, of reconciliation, and leave more\r\ntime for new projects of provocation. Yesterday witnessed a scandalous\r\nscene in the House of Representatives. It was the day for taking up the\r\nreport of their committee against the alien and sedition laws, &c. They\r\nheld a caucus and determined that not a word should be spoken on their\r\nside, in answer to anything which should be said on the other. Gallatin\r\ntook up the alien, and Nicholas the sedition law; but after a little while\r\nof common silence, they began to enter into loud conversations, laugh,\r\ncough, &c., so that for the last hour of these gentlemen's speaking, they\r\nmust have had the lungs of a vendue master to have been heard. Livingston,\r\nhowever, attempted to speak. But after a few sentences, the Speaker called\r\nhim to order, and told him what he was saying was not to the question. It\r\nwas impossible to proceed. The question was taken and carried in favor of\r\nthe report, fifty-two to forty-eight; the real strength of the two parties\r\nis fifty-six to fifty. But two of the latter have not attended this\r\nsession. I send you the report of their committee. I still expect to leave\r\nthis on the 1st, and be with you on the 7th of March. But it is possible\r\nI may not set out till the 4th, and then shall not be with you till the\r\n10th. Affectionately adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BISHOP MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 27, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of February 10th came safely to hand. We were\r\nfor a moment flattered with the hope of a friendly accommodation of our\r\ndifferences with France, by the President's nomination of Mr. Murray our\r\nMinister at the Hague to proceed to Paris for that purpose. But our hopes\r\nhave been entirely dashed by his revoking that and naming Mr. Ellsworth,\r\nMr. Patrick Henry and Murray; the two former not to embark from America\r\ntill _they_ shall receive assurances from the French Government, that\r\nthey will be received with the respect due to their character by the law\r\nof nations; and this too after the French Government had already given\r\nassurances that whatever Minister the President should send should be\r\nreceived with the respect due to the representative of a _great, free_\r\nand _independent_ nation. The effect of the new nomination is completely\r\nto parry the advances made by France towards a reconciliation. A great\r\nchange is taking place in the public mind in these Middle States, and they\r\nare rapidly resuming the Republican ground which they had for a moment\r\nrelinquished. The tables of Congress are loaded with petitions proving\r\nthis. Thirteen of the twenty-two counties of this State have already\r\npetitioned against the proceedings of the late Congress. Many also from\r\nNew York and New Jersey, and before the summer is over, these three States\r\nwill be in unison with the Southern and Western. I take the liberty of\r\nputting under your cover a letter for a young gentleman known to you, and\r\nto whom I know not how otherwise to direct it. I am, with great esteem,\r\ndear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO T. LOMAX.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 12, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your welcome favor of last month came to my hands in\r\nPhiladelphia. So long a time has elapsed since we have been separated by\r\nevents, that it was like a letter from the dead, and recalled to my memory\r\nvery dear recollections. My subsequent journey through life has offered\r\nnothing which, in comparison with those, is not cheerless and dreary. It\r\nis a rich comfort sometimes to look back on them.\r\n\r\nI take the liberty of enclosing a letter to Mr. Baylor, open, because I\r\nsolicit your perusal of it. It will, at the same time, furnish the apology\r\nfor my not answering you from Philadelphia. You ask for any communication\r\nI may be able to make, which may administer comfort to you. I can give\r\nthat which is solid. The spirit of 1776 is not dead. It has only been\r\nslumbering. The body of the American people is substantially republican.\r\nBut their virtuous feelings have been played on by some fact with more\r\nfiction; they have been the dupes of artful manœuvres, and made for a\r\nmoment to be willing instruments in forging chains for themselves. But\r\ntime and truth have dissipated the delusion, and opened their eyes. They\r\nsee now that France has sincerely wished peace, and their seducers have\r\nwished war, as well for the loaves and fishes which arise out of war\r\nexpenses, as for the chance of changing the Constitution, while the people\r\nshould have time to contemplate nothing but the levies of men and money.\r\nPennsylvania, Jersey and New York are coming majestically round to the\r\ntrue principles. In Pennsylvania, thirteen out of twenty-two counties\r\nhad already petitioned on the alien and sedition laws. Jersey and New\r\nYork had begun the same movement, and though the rising of Congress\r\nstops that channel for the expression of their sentiment, the sentiment\r\nis going on rapidly, and before their next meeting those three States\r\nwill be solidly embodied in sentiment with the six southern and western\r\nones. The atrocious proceedings of France towards this country, had well\r\nnigh destroyed its liberties. The Anglomen and monocrats had so artfully\r\nconfounded the cause of France with that of freedom, that both went\r\ndown in the same scale. I sincerely join you in abjuring all political\r\nconnection with every foreign power; and though I cordially wish well\r\nto the progress of liberty in all nations, and would forever give it\r\nthe weight of our countenance, yet they are not to be touched without\r\ncontamination from their other bad principles. Commerce with all nations,\r\nalliance with none, should be our motto.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of the constant and unaltered affection of, dear Sir,\r\nyour sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDMUND RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 18, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received only two days ago your favor of the 12th, and as it\r\nwas on the eve of the return of our post, it was not possible to make so\r\nprompt a despatch of the answer. Of all the doctrines which have ever been\r\nbroached by the federal government, the novel one, of the common law being\r\nin force and cognizable as an existing law in their courts, is to me the\r\nmost formidable. All their other assumptions of un-given powers have been\r\nin the detail. The bank law, the treaty doctrine, the sedition act, alien\r\nact, the undertaking to change the State laws of evidence in the State\r\ncourts by certain parts of the stamp act, &c., &c., have been solitary,\r\nunconsequential, timid things, in comparison with the audacious, barefaced\r\nand sweeping pretension to a system of law for the United States, without\r\nthe adoption of their Legislature, and so infinitively beyond their power\r\nto adopt. If this assumption be yielded to, the State courts may be shut\r\nup, as there will then be nothing to hinder citizens of the same State\r\nsuing each other in the federal courts in every case, as on a bond for\r\ninstance, because the common law obliges payment of it, and the common\r\nlaw they say is their law. I am happy you have taken up the subject; and I\r\nhave carefully perused and considered the notes you enclosed, and find but\r\na single paragraph which I do not approve. It is that wherein (page two)\r\nyou say, that laws being emanations from the legislative department, and,\r\nwhen once enacted, continuing in force from a presumption that their will\r\nso continues, that that presumption fails and the laws of course fall,\r\non the destruction of that legislative department. I do not think this is\r\nthe true bottom on which laws and the administering them rest. The whole\r\nbody of the nation is the sovereign legislative, judiciary and executive\r\npower for itself. The inconvenience of meeting to exercise these powers\r\nin person, and their inaptitude to exercise them, induce them to appoint\r\nspecial organs to declare their legislative will, to judge and to execute\r\nit. It is the will of the nation which makes the law obligatory; it is\r\ntheir will which creates or annihilates the organ which is to declare and\r\nannounce it. They may do it by a single person, as an Emperor of Russia,\r\n(constituting his declarations evidence of their will,) or by a few\r\npersons, as the aristocracy of Venice, or by a complication of councils,\r\nas in our former regal government, or our present republican one. The\r\nlaw being law because it is the will of the nation, is not changed by\r\ntheir changing the organ through which they choose to announce their\r\nfuture will; no more than the acts I have done by one attorney lose their\r\nobligation by my changing or discontinuing that attorney. This doctrine\r\nhas been, in a certain degree, sanctioned by the federal executive. For\r\nit is precisely that on which the continuance of obligation from our\r\ntreaty with France was established, and the doctrine was particularly\r\ndeveloped in a letter to Gouverneur Morris, written with the approbation\r\nof President Washington and his cabinet. Mercer once prevailed on the\r\nVirginia Assembly to declare a different doctrine in some resolutions.\r\nThese met universal disapprobation in this, as well as the other States,\r\nand if I mistake not, a subsequent Assembly did something to do away the\r\nauthority of their former unguarded resolutions. In this case, as in all\r\nothers, the true principle will be quite as effectual to establish the\r\njust deductions. Before the revolution, the nation of Virginia had, by\r\nthe organs they then thought proper to constitute, established a system\r\nof laws, which they divided into three denominations of 1, common law; 2,\r\nstatute law; 3, chancery: or if you please, into two only, of 1, common\r\nlaw; 2, chancery. When, by the Declaration of Independence, they chose\r\nto abolish their former organs of declaring their will, the acts of will\r\nalready formally and constitutionally declared, remained untouched. For\r\nthe nation was not dissolved, was not annihilated; its will, therefore,\r\nremained in full vigor; and on the establishing the new organs, first\r\nof a convention, and afterwards a more complicated legislature, the old\r\nacts of national will continued in force, until the nation should, by its\r\nnew organs, declare its will changed. The common law, therefore, which\r\nwas not in force when we landed here, nor till we had formed ourselves\r\ninto a nation, and had manifested by the organs we constituted that\r\nthe common law was to be our law, continued to be our law, because the\r\nnation continued in being, and because though it changed the organs for\r\nthe future declarations of its will, yet it did not change its former\r\ndeclarations that the common law was its law. Apply these principles to\r\nthe present case. Before the revolution there existed no such nation as\r\nthe United States; they then first associated as a nation, but for special\r\npurposes only. They had all their laws to make, as Virginia had on her\r\nfirst establishment as a nation. But they did not, as Virginia had done,\r\nproceed to adopt a whole system of laws ready made to their hand. As their\r\nassociation as a nation was only for special purposes, to wit, for the\r\nmanagement of their concerns with one another and with foreign nations,\r\nand the States composing the association chose to give it powers for those\r\npurposes and no others, they could not adopt any general system, because\r\nit would have embraced objects on which this association had no right to\r\nform or declare a will. It was not the organ for declaring a national will\r\nin these cases. In the cases confided to them, they were free to declare\r\nthe will of the nation, the law; but till it was declared there could be\r\nno law. So that the common law did not become, _ipso facto_, law on the\r\nnew association; it could only become so by a positive adoption, and so\r\nfar only as they were authorized to adopt.\r\n\r\nI think it will be of great importance, when you come to the proper part,\r\nto portray at full length the consequences of this new doctrine, that the\r\ncommon law is the law of the United States, and that their courts have, of\r\ncourse, jurisdiction co-extensive with that law, that is to say, general\r\nover all cases and persons. But, great heavens! Who could have conceived\r\nin 1789, that within ten years we should have to combat such windmills.\r\nAdieu. Yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 26, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am deeply impressed with the importance of Virginia and\r\nKentucky pursuing the same tract at the ensuing sessions of their\r\nLegislatures. Your going thither furnishes a valuable opportunity of\r\neffecting it, and as Mr. Madison will be at our Assembly as well as\r\nyourself, I thought it important to procure a meeting between you. I\r\ntherefore wrote to propose to him to ride to this place on Saturday or\r\nSunday next; supposing that both he and yourself might perhaps have some\r\nmatter of business at our court, which might render it less inconvenient\r\nfor you to be here together on Sunday. I took for granted that you would\r\nnot set off to Kentucky pointedly at the time you first proposed, and hope\r\nand strongly urge your favoring us with a visit at the time proposed. Mrs.\r\nMadison, who was the bearer of my letter, assured me I might count on Mr.\r\nM.'s being here. Not that I mentioned to her the object of my request, or\r\nthat I should propose the same to you, because, I presume, the less said\r\nof such a meeting the better. I shall take care that Mrs. Monroe shall\r\ndine with us. In hopes of seeing you, I bid you affectionately adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 5, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of August 30th came duly to hand. It was with great\r\nregret we gave up the hope of seeing you here, but could not but consider\r\nthe obstacle as legitimate. I had written to Mr. Madison, as I had before\r\ninformed you, and had stated to him some general ideas for consideration\r\nand consultation when we should meet. I thought something essentially\r\nnecessary to be said, in order to avoid the inference of acquiescence;\r\nthat a resolution or declaration should be passed, 1, answering the\r\nreasonings of such of the States as have ventured into the field of\r\nreason, and that of the committee of Congress, taking some notice\r\ntoo of those States who have either not answered at all, or answered\r\nwithout reasoning. 2. Making firm protestation against the precedent\r\nand principle, and _reserving_ the right to make this palpable violation\r\nof the federal compact the ground of doing in future whatever we might\r\nnow rightfully do, should repetitions of these and other violations\r\nof the compact render it expedient. 3. Expressing in affectionate and\r\nconciliatory language our warm attachment to union with our sister States,\r\nand to the instrument and principles by which we are united; that we are\r\nwilling to sacrifice to this everything but the rights of self-government\r\nin those important points which we have never yielded, and in which alone\r\nwe see liberty, safety, and happiness; that not at all disposed to make\r\nevery measure of error or of wrong, a cause of scission, we are willing\r\nto look on with indulgence, and to wait with patience till those passions\r\nand delusions shall have passed over, which the federal government have\r\nartfully excited to cover its own abuses and conceal its designs, fully\r\nconfident that the good sense of the American people, and their attachment\r\nto those very rights which we are now vindicating, will, before it shall\r\nbe too late, rally with us round the true principles of our federal\r\ncompact. This was only meant to give a general idea of the complexion and\r\ntopics of such an instrument. Mr. M. who came, as had been proposed, does\r\nnot concur in the _reservation_ proposed above; and from this I recede\r\nreadily, not only in deference to his judgment, but because, as we should\r\nnever think of separation but for repeated and enormous violations, so\r\nthese, when they occur, will be cause enough of themselves.\r\n\r\nTo these topics, however, should be added animadversions on the new\r\npretensions to a _common law_ of the United States. I proposed to Mr. M.\r\nto write to you, but he observed that you knew his sentiments so perfectly\r\nfrom a former conference, that it was unnecessary. As to the preparing\r\nanything, I must decline it, to avoid suspicions (which were pretty strong\r\nin some quarters on the late occasion), and because there remains still\r\n(after their late loss) a mass of talents in Kentucky sufficient for\r\nevery purpose. The only object of the present communication is to procure\r\na concert in the general plan of action, as it is extremely desirable\r\nthat Virginia and Kentucky should pursue the same track on this occasion.\r\nBesides, how could you better while away the road from hence to Kentucky,\r\nthan in meditating this very subject, and preparing something yourself,\r\nthan whom nobody will do it better. The loss of your brother, and the\r\nvisit of the apostle * * * * * to Kentucky, excite anxiety.[11] However,\r\nwe doubt not that his poisons will be effectually counterworked. Wishing\r\nyou a pleasant journey and happy return, I am with great and sincere\r\nesteem, dear Sir, your affectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [11] [Here, and in almost every other case where the name is\r\n          omitted, it is omitted in the original.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, November 22, 1799.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have never answered your letter by Mr. Polk, because I\r\nexpected to have paid you a visit. This has been prevented by various\r\ncauses, till yesterday. That being the day fixed for the departure of my\r\ndaughter Eppes, my horses were ready for me to have set out to see you:\r\nan accident postponed her departure to this day, and my visit also. But\r\nColonel Monroe dined with me yesterday, and on my asking his commands for\r\nyou, he entered into the subject of the visit and dissuaded it entirely,\r\nfounding the motives on the _espionage_ of the little * * * * * in\r\n* * * * * who would make it a subject of some political slander, and\r\nperhaps of some political injury. I have yielded to his representations,\r\nand therefore shall not have the pleasure of seeing you till my return\r\nfrom Philadelphia. I regret it sincerely, not only on motives of attention\r\nbut of affairs. Some late circumstances changing considerably the aspect\r\nof our situation, must affect the line of conduct to be observed. I regret\r\nit the more too, because from the commencement of the ensuing session, I\r\nshall trust the post offices with nothing confidential, persuaded that\r\nduring the ensuing twelve months they will lend their inquisitorial\r\naid to furnish matter for newspapers. I shall send you as usual printed\r\ncommunications, without saying anything confidential on them. You will of\r\ncourse understand the cause.\r\n\r\nIn your new station[12] let me recommend to you the jury system: as also\r\nthe restoration of juries in the court of chancery, which a law not long\r\nsince repealed, because \"the trial by jury is troublesome and expensive.\"\r\nIf the reason be good, they should abolish it at common law also. If Peter\r\nCarr is elected in the room of * * * * * he will undertake the proposing\r\nthis business, and only need your support. If he is not elected, I hope\r\nyou will get it done otherwise. My best respects to Mrs. Madison, and\r\naffectionate salutations to yourself.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [12] The Legislature of Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 12, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of January the 4th was received last night. I had then\r\nno opportunity of communicating to you confidentially information of the\r\nstate of opinions here; but I learn to-night that two Mr. Randolphs will\r\nset out to-morrow morning for Richmond. If I can get this into their\r\nhands I shall send it, otherwise it may wait longer. On the subject of an\r\nelection by a general ticket, or by districts, most persons here seem to\r\nhave made up their minds. All agree that an election by districts would\r\nbe best, if it could be general; but while ten States choose either by\r\ntheir legislatures or by a general ticket, it is folly and worse than\r\nfolly for the other six not to do it. In these ten States the minority is\r\ncertainly unrepresented; and their majorities not only have the weight\r\nof their whole State in their scale, but have the benefit of so much of\r\nour minorities as can succeed at a district election. This is, in fact,\r\nensuring to our minorities the appointment of the government. To state\r\nit in another form; it is merely a question whether we will divide the\r\nUnited States into sixteen or one hundred and thirty-seven districts.\r\nThe latter being more checquered, and representing the people in smaller\r\nsections, would be more likely to be an exact representation of their\r\ndiversified sentiments. But a representation of a part by great, and part\r\nby small sections, would give a result very different from what would\r\nbe the sentiment of the whole people of the United States, were they\r\nassembled together. I have to-day had a conversation with * * * * * who\r\nhas taken a flying trip here from New York. He says, they have now really\r\na majority in the House of Representatives, but for want of some skilful\r\nperson to rally round, they are disjointed, and will lose every question.\r\nIn the Senate there is a majority of eight or nine against us. But in the\r\nnew election which is to come on in April, three or four in the Senate\r\nwill be changed in our favor; and in the House of Representatives the\r\ncounty elections will still be better than the last; but still all will\r\ndepend on the city election, which is of twelve members. At present there\r\nwould be no doubt of our carrying our ticket there; nor does there seem\r\nto be time for any events arising to change that disposition. There is\r\ntherefore the best prospect possible of a great and decided majority on\r\na joint vote of the two Houses. They are so confident of this, that the\r\nrepublican party there will not consent to elect either by districts or\r\na general ticket. They choose to do it by their legislature. I am told\r\nthe republicans of New Jersey are equally confident, and equally anxious\r\nagainst an election either by districts or a general ticket. The contest\r\nin this State will end in a separation of the present legislature without\r\npassing any election law, (and their former one has expired), and in\r\ndepending on the new one, which will be elected October the 14th, in which\r\nthe republican majority will be more decided in the Representatives, and\r\ninstead of a majority of five against us in the Senate, will be of one\r\nfor us. They will, from the necessity of the case, choose the electors\r\nthemselves. Perhaps it will be thought I ought in delicacy to be silent\r\non this subject. But you, who know me, know that my private gratifications\r\nwould be most indulged by that issue, which should leave me most at home.\r\nIf anything supersedes this propensity, it is merely the desire to see\r\nthis government brought back to its republican principles. Consider this\r\nas written to Mr. Madison as much as yourself; and communicate it, if\r\nyou think it will do any good, to those possessing our joint confidence,\r\nor any others where it may be useful and safe. Health and affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PARKER.\r\n\r\n                                        SENATE CHAMBER, January 13th, 1800.\r\n\r\nSIR,--In answer to the several inquiries in your letter of this day, I\r\nhave the honor to inform you that the marble statue of General Washington\r\nin the Capitol in Richmond, with its pedestal, cost in Paris 24,000\r\nlivres or 1,000 Louis d'ors. It is of the size of life, and made by\r\nHoudon, reckoned one of the first statuaries in Europe. Besides this, we\r\npaid Houdon's expenses coming to and returning from Virginia to take the\r\nGeneral's likeness, which as well as I recollect were about 500 guineas,\r\nand the transportation of the statue to Virginia with a workman to put it\r\nup, the amount of which I never heard.\r\n\r\nThe price of an equestrian statue of the usual size, which is considerably\r\nabove that of life, whether in marble or bronze, costs in Paris 40,000\r\nLouis d'ors from the best hand. Houdon asked that price for one that had\r\nbeen thought of for General Washington; but I do not recollect whether\r\nthis included the pedestal of marble, which is a considerable piece of\r\nwork. These were the prices in 1785 in Paris. I believe that in Rome\r\nor Florence, the same thing may be had from the best artists for about\r\ntwo-thirds of the above prices, executed in the marble of Carrara, the\r\nbest now known. But unless Ciracchi's busts of General Washington are,\r\nany of them, there, it would be necessary to send there one of Houdon's\r\nfigures in plaster, which, packed properly for safe transportation, would\r\nprobably cost 20 or 30 guineas. I do not know that any of Carrachi's busts\r\nof the General are to be had anywhere. I am, with great consideration Sir,\r\nyour very humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MORGAN BROWN, PALMYRA.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 16, 1800.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your letter of October 1, has been duly received, and I have to\r\nmake you my acknowledgments for the offer of the two Indian busts found\r\non the Cumberland, and in your possession. Such monuments of the state of\r\nthe arts among the Indians, are too singular not to be highly esteemed,\r\nand I shall preserve them as such with great care. They will furnish new\r\nand strong proofs how far the patience and perseverance of the Indian\r\nartist supplied the very limited means of execution which he possessed.\r\nAccept therefore, I pray you, my sincere thanks for your kind offer, and\r\nassurances of the gratification these curiosities will yield here. As\r\nsuch objects cannot be conveyed without injury but by water, I will ask\r\nthe favor of you to forward them by some vessel going down the river to\r\nOrleans, to the address of Mr. Daniel Clarke, junior, of that place, to\r\nwhom I wrote to have them forwarded round by sea, and to answer for me the\r\nexpenses of transportation, package, &c. I am, with many acknowledgments\r\nfor this mark of your attention, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR PRIESTLY.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 18, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to thank you for the pamphlets you were so kind as to\r\nsend me. You will know what I thought of them by my having before sent a\r\ndozen sets to Virginia to distribute among my friends. Yet I thank you not\r\nthe less for these, which I value the more as they came from yourself. The\r\nstock of them which Campbell had was, I believe, exhausted the first or\r\nsecond day of advertising them. The papers of political arithmetic, both\r\nin yours and Mr. Cooper's pamphlets, are the most precious gifts that can\r\nbe made to us; for we are running navigation mad, and commerce mad, and\r\nnavy mad, which is worst of all. How desirable is it that you could pursue\r\nthat subject for us. From the Porcupines of our country you will receive\r\nno thanks; but the great mass of our nation will edify and thank you.\r\nHow deeply have I been chagrined and mortified at the persecutions which\r\nfanaticism and monarchy have excited against you, even here! At first I\r\nbelieved it was merely a continuance of the English persecution. But I\r\nobserve that on the demise of Porcupine and division of his inheritance\r\nbetween Fenno and Brown, the latter (though succeeding only to the\r\n_federal_ portion of Porcupinism, not the _Anglican_, which is Fenno's\r\npart) serves up for the palate of his sect, dishes of abuse against you\r\nas high seasoned as Porcupine's were. You have sinned against church and\r\nking, and can therefore never be forgiven. How sincerely have I regretted\r\nthat your friend, before he fixed his choice of a position, did not\r\nvisit the valleys on each side of the ridge in Virginia, as Mr. Madison\r\nand myself so much wished. You would have found there equal soil, the\r\nfinest climate and most healthy one on the earth, the homage of universal\r\nreverence and love, and the power of the country spread over you as a\r\nshield. But since you would not make it your country by adoption, you must\r\nnow do it by your good offices. I have one to propose to you which will\r\nproduce their good, and gratitude to you for ages, and in the way to which\r\nyou have devoted a long life, that of spreading light among men.\r\n\r\nWe have in that State a College (William and Mary) just well enough\r\nendowed to draw out the miserable existence to which a miserable\r\nconstitution has doomed it. It is moreover eccentric in its position,\r\nexposed to all bilious diseases as all the lower country is, and therefore\r\nabandoned by the public care, as that part of the country itself is in\r\na considerable degree by its inhabitants. We wish to establish in the\r\nupper country, and more centrally for the State, an University on a plan\r\nso broad and liberal and _modern_, as to be worth patronizing with the\r\npublic support, and be a temptation to the youth of other States to come\r\nand drink of the cup of knowledge and fraternize with us. The first step\r\nis to obtain a good plan; that is, a judicious selection of the sciences,\r\nand a practicable grouping of some of them together, and ramifying of\r\nothers, so as to adopt the professorships to our uses and our means. In\r\nan institution meant chiefly for use, some branches of science, formerly\r\nesteemed, may be now omitted; so may others now valued in Europe, but\r\nuseless to us for ages to come. As an example of the former, the oriental\r\nlearning, and of the latter, almost the whole of the institution proposed\r\nto Congress by the Secretary of War's report of the 5th inst. Now there is\r\nno one to whom this subject is so familiar as yourself. There is no one in\r\nthe world who, equally with yourself, unites this full possession of the\r\nsubject with such a knowledge of the state of our existence, as enables\r\nyou to fit the garment to him who is to _pay_ for it and to _wear_ it. To\r\nyou therefore we address our solicitations, and to lessen to you as much\r\nas possible the ambiguities of our object, I will venture even to sketch\r\nthe sciences which seem useful and practicable for us, as they occur to\r\nme while holding my pen. Botany, chemistry, zoology, anatomy, surgery,\r\nmedicine, natural philosophy, agriculture, mathematics, astronomy,\r\ngeography, politics, commerce, history, ethics, law, arts, fine arts. This\r\nlist is imperfect because I make it hastily, and because I am unequal to\r\nthe subject. It is evident that some of these articles are too much for\r\none professor and must therefore be ramified; others may be ascribed in\r\ngroups to a single professor. This is the difficult part of the work,\r\nand requires a head perfectly knowing the extent of each branch, and the\r\nlimits within which it may be circumscribed, so as to bring the whole\r\nwithin the powers of the fewest professors possible, and consequently\r\nwithin the degree of expense practicable for us. We should propose that\r\nthe professors follow no other calling, so that their whole time may be\r\ngiven to their academical functions; and we should propose to draw from\r\nEurope the first characters in science, by considerable temptations,\r\nwhich would not need to be repeated after the first set should have\r\nprepared fit successors and given reputation to the institution. From some\r\nsplendid characters I have received offers most perfectly reasonable and\r\npracticable.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to give you all this trouble merely of my own head,\r\nthat would be arrogance. It has been the subject of consultation among\r\nthe ablest and highest characters of our State, who only wait for a plan\r\nto make a joint and I hope a successful effort to get the thing carried\r\ninto effect. They will receive your ideas with the greatest deference\r\nand thankfulness. We shall be here certainly for two months to come; but\r\nshould you not have leisure to think of it before Congress adjourns, it\r\nwill come safely to me afterwards by post, the nearest post office being\r\nMilton.\r\n\r\nWill not the arrival of Dupont tempt you to make a visit to this quarter?\r\nI have no doubt the alarmists are already whetting their shafts for\r\nhim also, but their gas is nearly run out, and the day I believe is\r\napproaching when we shall be as free to pursue what is true wisdom as the\r\neffects of their follies will permit; for some of them we shall be forced\r\nto wade through because we are emerged in them.\r\n\r\nWishing you that pure happiness which your pursuits and circumstances\r\noffer, and which I am sure you are too wise to suffer a diminution of by\r\nthe pigmy assaults made on you, and with every sentiment of affectionate\r\nesteem and respect, I am, dear Sir, your most humble, and most obedient\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY INNIS, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 23, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of December 6th I received here on the 30th of same\r\nmonth, and have to thank you for the papers it contained. They serve to\r\nprove that if Cressap was not of the party of Logan's murderers, yet no\r\ninjury was done his character by believing it. I shall, while here this\r\nwinter, publish such material testimony on the subject as I have received;\r\nwhich by the kindness of my friends will be amply sufficient. It will\r\nappear that the deed was generally imputed to Cressap by both whites and\r\nIndians, that his character was justly stained with their blood, perhaps\r\nthat he ordered this transaction, but that he was not himself present\r\nat the time. I shall consequently make a proper change in the text of\r\nthe Notes on Virginia, to be adopted, if any future edition of that work\r\nshould be printed.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the judiciary district to be established for the Western\r\nStates, nothing can be wilder than to annex to them any State on the\r\nEastern waters. I do not know what may be the dispositions of the House of\r\nRepresentatives on that subject, but I should hope from what I recollect\r\nof those manifested by the Senate on the same subject at the former\r\nsession, that they may be induced to set off the Western country in a\r\ndistrict. And I expect that the reason of the thing must bring both Houses\r\ninto the measure.\r\n\r\nThe Mississippi Territory has petitioned to be placed at once in what is\r\ncalled the second stage of government. Surely, such a government as the\r\nfirst form prescribed for the Territories is a despotic oligarchy without\r\none rational object.\r\n\r\nI had addressed the enclosed letters to the care of the postmaster at\r\nLouisville; but not knowing him, I have concluded it better to ask the\r\nfavor of you to avail them of any passage which may offer down the river.\r\nI presume the boats stop of course at those places.\r\n\r\nWe have wonderful rumors here at this time. One that the King of England\r\nis dead. As this would ensure a general peace, I do not know that it would\r\nbe any misfortune to humanity. The other is that Bonaparte, Sieyes and\r\nDucos have usurped the French government. This is _West India_ news, and\r\nshows that after killing Bonaparte a thousand times, they have still a\r\nvariety of parts to be acted by him. Were it really true----. While I was\r\nwriting the last word a gentleman enters my room and brings a confirmation\r\nthat something has happened at Paris. This is arrived at New York by a\r\nship from Cork. The particulars differ from the West India account. We are\r\ntherefore only to believe that a revolution of some kind has taken place,\r\nand that Bonaparte is at the head of it, but what are the particulars and\r\nwhat the object, we must wait with patience to learn. In the meantime\r\nwe may speak hypothetically. If Bonaparte declares for Royalty, either\r\nin his own person, or of Louis XVIII., he has but a few days to live. In\r\na nation of so much enthusiasm, there must be a million of Brutuses who\r\nwill devote themselves to death to destroy him. But, without much faith in\r\nBonaparte's heart, I have so much in his head, as to indulge another train\r\nof reflection. The republican world has been long looking with anxiety on\r\nthe two experiments going on of a _single_ elective Executive here, and\r\na plurality there. Opinions have been considerably divided on the event\r\nin both countries. The greater opinion there has seemed to be heretofore\r\nin favor of a plurality, here it has been very generally, though not\r\nuniversally, in favor of a single elective Executive. After eight or nine\r\nyears experience of perpetual broils and factions in their Directory, a\r\nstanding division (under all changes) of three against two, which results\r\nin a government by a single opinion, it is possible they may think the\r\nexperiment decided in favor of our form, and that Bonaparte may be for\r\na single executive, limited in time and power, and flatter himself with\r\nthe election to that office; and that to this change the nation may rally\r\nitself; perhaps it is the only one to which all parties could be rallied.\r\nIn every case it is to be feared and deplored that, that nation has yet to\r\nwade through half a century of disorder and convulsions. These, however,\r\nare conjectures only, which you will take as such, and accept assurances\r\nof the great esteem and attachment of, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. PRIESTLY.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 27, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In my last letter of the 18th, I omitted to say any thing\r\nof the languages as part of our proposed University. It was not that\r\nI think, as some do, that they are useless. I am of a very different\r\nopinion. I do not think them very essential to the obtaining eminent\r\ndegrees of science; but I think them very useful towards it. I suppose\r\nthere is a portion of life during which our faculties are ripe enough for\r\nthis, and for nothing more useful. I think the Greeks and Romans have\r\nleft us the present models which exist of fine composition, whether we\r\nexamine them as works of reason, or of style and fancy; and to them we\r\nprobably owe these characteristics of modern composition. I know of no\r\ncomposition of any other ancient people, which merits the least regard\r\nas a model for its matter or style. To all this I add, that to read the\r\nLatin and Greek authors in their original, is a sublime luxury; and I\r\ndeem luxury in science to be at least as justifiable as in architecture,\r\npainting, gardening, or the other arts. I enjoy Homer in his own language\r\ninfinitely beyond Pope's translation of him, and both beyond the dull\r\nnarrative of the same events by Dares Phrygius; and it is an innocent\r\nenjoyment. I thank on my knees, Him who directed my early education, for\r\nhaving put into my possession this rich source of delight; and I would\r\nnot exchange it for anything which I could then have acquired, and have\r\nnot since acquired. With this regard for those languages, you will acquit\r\nme of meaning to omit them. About twenty years ago, I drew a bill for\r\nour legislature, which proposed to lay off every county into hundreds or\r\ntownships of five or six miles square, in the centre of each of them was\r\nto be a free English school; the whole State was further laid off into\r\nten districts, in each of which was to be a college for teaching the\r\nlanguages, geography, surveying, and other useful things of that grade;\r\nand then a single University for the sciences. It was received with\r\nenthusiasm; but as I had proposed that William and Mary, under an improved\r\nform, should be the University, and that was at that time pretty highly\r\nEpiscopal, the dissenters after awhile began to apprehend some secret\r\ndesign of a preference to that sect. About three years ago they enacted\r\nthat part of my bill which related to English schools, except that instead\r\nof obliging, they left it optional in the court of every county to carry\r\nit into execution or not. I think it probable the part of the plan for the\r\nmiddle grade of education, may also be brought forward in due time. In the\r\nmeanwhile, we are not without a sufficient number of good country schools,\r\nwhere the languages, geography, and the first elements of mathematics, are\r\ntaught. Having omitted this information in my former letter, I thought\r\nit necessary now to supply it, that you might know on what base your\r\nsuperstructure was to be reared. I have a letter from Mr. Dupont, since\r\nhis arrival at New York, dated the 20th, in which he says he will be\r\nin Philadelphia within about a fortnight from that time; but only on a\r\nvisit. How much would it delight me if a visit from you at the same time,\r\nwere to show us two such illustrious foreigners embracing each other in\r\nmy country, as the asylum for whatever is great and good. Pardon, I pray\r\nyou, the temporary delirium which has been excited here, but which is fast\r\npassing away. The Gothic idea that we are to look backwards instead of\r\nforwards for the improvement of the human mind, and to recur to the annals\r\nof our ancestors for what is most perfect in government, in religion and\r\nin learning, is worthy of those bigots in religion and government, by whom\r\nit has been recommended, and whose purposes it would answer. But it is not\r\nan idea which this country will endure; and the moment of their showing it\r\nis fast ripening; and the signs of it will be their respect for you, and\r\ngrowing detestation of those who have dishonored our country by endeavors\r\nto disturb our tranquillity in it. No one has felt this with more\r\nsensibility than, my dear Sir, your respectful and affectionate friend and\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN BRACKENRIDGE.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, January 29, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 13th has been duly received, as had been\r\nthat containing the resolutions of your legislature on the subject of the\r\nformer resolutions. I was glad to see the subject taken up, and done with\r\nso much temper, firmness and propriety. From the reason of the thing I\r\ncannot but hope that the western country will be laid off into a separate\r\njudiciary district. From what I recollect of the dispositions on the\r\nsame subject at the last session, I should expect that the partiality to\r\na general and uniform system would yield to geographical and physical\r\nimpracticabilities. I was once a great advocate for introducing into\r\nchancery _vivâ voce_ testimony, and trial by jury. I am still so as to\r\nthe latter, but have retired from the former opinion on the information\r\nreceived from both your State and ours, that it worked inconveniently. I\r\nintroduced it into the Virginia law, but did not return to the bar, so\r\nas to see how it answered. But I do not understand how the _vivâ voce_\r\nexamination comes to be practiced in the Federal court with you, and not\r\nin your own courts; the Federal courts being decided by law to proceed and\r\ndecide by the laws of the States. * * * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nTO N. R----.\r\n\r\n                                            PHILADELPHIA, February 2, 1800.\r\n\r\nMy letters to yourself and my dear Martha have been of January 13th, 21st,\r\nand 28th. I now enclose a letter lately received for her. You will see\r\nin the newspapers all the details we have of the proceedings of Paris.\r\nI observe that Lafayette is gone there. When we see him, Volney, Sieyes,\r\nTalleyrand, gathering round the new powers, we may conjecture from thence\r\ntheir views and principles. Should it be really true that Bonaparte\r\nhas usurped the government with an intention of making it a free one,\r\nwhatever his talents may be for war, we have no proofs that he is skilled\r\nin forming governments friendly to the people. Wherever he has meddled\r\nwe have seen nothing but fragments of the old Roman government stuck\r\ninto materials with which they can form no cohesion: we see the bigotry\r\nof an Italian to the ancient splendor of his country, but nothing which\r\nbespeaks a luminous view of the organization of rational government.\r\nPerhaps however this may end better than we augur; and it certainly\r\nwill if his head is equal to true and solid calculations of glory. It is\r\ngenerally hoped here that peace may take place. There was before no union\r\nof views between Austria and the members of the triple coalition; and the\r\ndefeats of Suwarrow appear to have completely destroyed the confidence\r\nof Russia in that power, and the failure of the Dutch expedition to\r\nhave weaned him from the plans of England. The withdrawing his armies we\r\nhope is the signal for the entire dissolution of the coalition, and for\r\nevery one seeking his separate peace. We have great need of this event,\r\nthat foreign affairs may no longer bear so heavily on ours. We have\r\ngreat need for the ensuing twelve months to be left to ourselves. The\r\nenemies of our Constitution are preparing a fearful operation, and the\r\ndissensions in this State are too likely to bring things to the situation\r\nthey wish, when our Bonaparte, surrounded by his comrades in arms,\r\nmay step in to give us political salvation in his way. It behoves our\r\ncitizens to be on their guard, to be firm in their principles, and full\r\nof confidence in themselves. We are able to preserve our self-government\r\nif we will but think so. I think the return of Lafayette to Paris ensures\r\na reconciliation between them and us. He will so entwist himself with\r\nthe Envoys that they will not be able to draw off. Mr. C. Pinckney has\r\nbrought into the Senate a bill for the uniform appointment of juries. A\r\ntax on Public stock, Bank stock, &c., is to be proposed. This would bring\r\none hundred and fifty millions into contribution with the lands, and\r\nlevy a sensible proportion of the expenses of a war on those who are so\r\nanxious to engage us in it. Robins' affair is perhaps to be inquired into.\r\nHowever, the majority against these things leave no hope of success. It\r\nis most unfortunate that while Virginia and North Carolina were steady,\r\nthe Middle States drew back; now that these are laying their shoulders\r\nto the draught, Virginia and North Carolina baulk; so that never drawing\r\ntogether, the Eastern States, steady and unbroken, draw all to themselves.\r\nI was mistaken last week in saying no more failures had happened. New\r\nones have been declaring every day in Baltimore, others here and at New\r\nYork. The last here have been Nottnagil, Montmollin and Co., and Peter\r\nBlight. These sums are enormous. I do not know the firms of the bankrupt\r\nhouses in Baltimore, but the crush will be incalculable. In the present\r\nstagnation of commerce, and particularly that in tobacco, it is difficult\r\nto transfer money from hence to Richmond. Government bills on their custom\r\nhouse at Bermuda can from time to time be had. I think it would be best\r\nfor Mr. Barnes always to keep them bespoke, and to remit in that way your\r\ninstalments as fast as they are either due or within the discountable\r\nperiod. The 1st is due the middle of March, and so from two months to\r\ntwo months in five equal instalments. I am looking out to see whether\r\nsuch a difference of price here may be had as will warrant our bringing\r\nour tobacco from New York here, rather than take eight dollars there.\r\nWe have been very unfortunate in this whole business. First in our own\r\nmiscalculations of the effect of the non-intercourse law; and where we had\r\ncorrected our opinions, that our instructions were from good, but mistaken\r\nviews, not executed. My constant love to my dear Martha, kisses to her\r\nyoung ones, and affectionate esteem to yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                           PHILADELPHIA, February 26, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Erving delivered me your favor of January 31st, and I thank\r\nyou for making me acquainted with him. You will always do me a favor\r\nin giving me an opportunity of knowing gentlemen as estimable in their\r\nprinciples and talents as I find Mr. Erving to be. I have not yet seen Mr.\r\nWinthrop. A letter from you, my respectable friend, after three and twenty\r\nyears of separation, has given me a pleasure I cannot express. It recalls\r\nto my mind the anxious days we then passed in struggling for the cause\r\nof mankind. Your principles have been tested in the crucible of time, and\r\nhave come out pure. You have proved that it was monarchy, and not merely\r\nBritish monarchy, you opposed. A government by representatives, elected by\r\nthe people at _short_ periods, was our object; and our maxim at that day\r\nwas, \"where annual election ends, tyranny begins;\" nor have our departures\r\nfrom it been sanctioned by the happiness of their effects. A debt of an\r\nhundred millions growing by usurious interest, and an artificial paper\r\nphalanx overruling the agricultural mass of our country, with other _et\r\nceteras_, have a portentous aspect.\r\n\r\nI fear our friends on the other side of the water, laboring in the same\r\ncause, have yet a great deal of crime and misery to wade through. My\r\nconfidence has been placed in the head, not in the heart of Bonaparte.\r\nI hoped he would calculate truly the difference between the fame of\r\na Washington and a Cromwell. Whatever his views may be, he has at\r\nleast transferred the destinies of the republic from the civil to the\r\nmilitary arm. Some will use this as a lesson against the practicability\r\nof republican government. I read it as a lesson against the danger of\r\nstanding armies.\r\n\r\nAdieu, my ever respected and venerable friend. May that kind overruling\r\nprovidence which has so long spared you to our country, still foster\r\nyour remaining years with whatever may make them comfortable to yourself\r\nand soothing to your friends. Accept the cordial salutations of your\r\naffectionate friend.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, March 4, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have never written to you since my arrival here, for\r\nreasons which were explained. Yours of December 29th, January the\r\n4th, 9th, 12th, 18th, and February the 14th, have therefore remained\r\nunacknowledged. I have at different times enclosed to you such papers as\r\nseemed interesting. To-day I forward Bingham's amendment to the election\r\nbill formerly enclosed to you, Mr. Pinckney's proposed amendment to the\r\nConstitution, and the report of the Ways and Means. Bingham's amendment\r\nwas lost by the usual majority of two to one. A very different one will\r\nbe proposed, containing the true sense of the minority, viz. that the two\r\nHouses, voting by heads, shall decide such questions as the Constitution\r\nauthorizes to be raised. This may probably be taken up in the other House\r\nunder better auspices, for though the federalists have a great majority\r\nthere, yet they are of a more moderate temper than for some time past. The\r\nSenate, however, seem determined to yield to nothing which shall give the\r\nother House greater weight in the decision on elections than they have.\r\n\r\nMr. Pinckney's motion has been supported, and is likely to have some\r\nvotes which were not expected. I rather believe he will withdraw it,\r\nand propose the same thing in the form of a bill; it being the opinion\r\nof some that such a regulation is not against the present Constitution.\r\nIn this form it will stand a better chance to pass, as a majority only\r\nin both Houses will be necessary. By putting off the building of the\r\nseventy-fours and stopping enlistments, the loan will be reduced to three\r\nand a half millions. But I think it cannot be obtained. For though no\r\nnew bankruptcies have happened here for some weeks, or in New York, yet\r\nthey continue to happen in Baltimore, and the whole commercial race are\r\nlying on their oars, and gathering in their affairs, not knowing what new\r\nfailures may put their resources to the proof. In this state of things\r\nthey cannot lend money. Some foreigners have taken asylum among us, with a\r\ngood deal of money, who may perhaps choose that deposit. Robbins' affair\r\nhas been under agitation for some days. Livingston made an able speech\r\nof two and a half hours yesterday. The advocates of the measure feel its\r\npressure heavily; and though they may be able to repel Livingston's motion\r\nof censure, I do not believe they can carry Bayard's of approbation. The\r\nlanding of our Envoys at Lisbon will risk a very dangerous consequence,\r\ninsomuch as the news of Truxton's aggression will perhaps arrive at Paris\r\nbefore our commissioners will. Had they gone directly there, they might\r\nhave been two months ahead of that news. We are entirely without further\r\ninformation from Paris. By letters from Bordeaux, of December the 7th,\r\ntobacco was then from twenty-five to twenty-seven dollars per hundred.\r\nYet did Marshall maintain on the non-intercourse bill, that its price at\r\nother markets had never been affected by that law. While the navigating\r\nand provision States, who are the majority, can keep open all the markets,\r\nor at least sufficient ones for their objects, the cries of the tobacco\r\nmakers, who are the minority, and not at all in favor, will hardly be\r\nlistened to. It is truly the fable of the monkey pulling the nuts out of\r\nthe fire with the cat's paw; and it shows that G. Mason's proposition in\r\nthe Convention was wise, that on laws regulating commerce, two-thirds of\r\nthe votes should be requisite to pass them. However, it would have been\r\ntrampled under foot by a triumphant majority.\r\n\r\nMarch 8. My letter has lain by me till now, waiting Mr. Trist's departure.\r\nThe question has been decided to-day on Livingston's motion respecting\r\nRobbins; thirty-five for it, about sixty against it. Livingston, Nicholas,\r\nand Gallatin distinguished themselves on one side, and J. Marshall greatly\r\non the other. Still it is believed they will not push Bayard's motion of\r\napprobation. We have this day also decided in Senate on the motion for\r\nover-hauling the editor of the Aurora. It was carried, as usual, by about\r\ntwo to one; H. Marshal voting of course with them, as did, and frequently\r\ndoes * * * * * of * * * * *, who is perfectly at market. It happens that\r\nthe other party are so strong, that they do not think either him or\r\n* * * * * worth buying. As the conveyance is confidential, I can\r\nsay something on a subject which, to those who do not know my real\r\ndispositions respecting it, might seem indelicate. The federalists\r\nbegin to be very seriously alarmed about their election next fall.\r\nTheir speeches in private, as well as their public and private demeanor\r\nto me, indicate it strongly. This seems to be the prospect. Keep out\r\nPennsylvania, Jersey, and New York, and the rest of the States are about\r\nequally divided; and in this estimate it is supposed that North Carolina\r\nand Maryland added together are equally divided. Then the event depends on\r\nthe three middle States before mentioned. As to them, Pennsylvania passes\r\nno law for an election at the present session. They confide that the next\r\nelection gives a decided majority in the two Houses, when joined together.\r\nM'Kean, therefore, intends to call the legislature to meet immediately\r\nafter the new election, to appoint electors themselves. Still you may\r\nbe sensible there may arise a difficulty between the two Houses about\r\nvoting by heads or by Houses. The republican members here from Jersey are\r\nentirely confident that their two Houses, joined together, have a majority\r\nof republicans; their Council being republican by six or eight votes, and\r\nthe lower House federal by only one or two; and they have no doubt the\r\napproaching election will be in favor of the republicans. They appoint\r\nelectors by the two Houses voting together. In New York all depends on\r\nthe success of the city election, which is of twelve members, and of\r\ncourse makes a difference of twenty-four, which is sufficient to make the\r\ntwo Houses, joined together, republican in their vote. Governor Clinton,\r\nGeneral Gates, and some other old revolutionary characters, have been put\r\non the republican ticket. Burr, Livingston, &c., entertain no doubt on\r\nthe event of that election. Still these are the ideas of the republicans\r\nonly in these three States, and we must make great allowance for their\r\nsanguine views. Upon the whole, I consider it as rather more doubtful\r\nthan the last election, in which I was not deceived in more than a vote\r\nor two. If Pennsylvania votes, then either Jersey or New York giving a\r\nrepublican vote, decides the election. If Pennsylvania does not vote,\r\nthen New York determines the election. In any event, we may say that if\r\nthe _city_ election of New York is in favor of the republican ticket, the\r\nissue will be republican; if the federal ticket for the city of New York\r\nprevails, the probabilities will be in favor of a federal issue, because\r\nit would then require a republican vote both from Jersey and Pennsylvania\r\nto preponderate against New York, on which we could not count with any\r\nconfidence. The election of New York being in April, it becomes an early\r\nand interesting object. It is probable the landing of our Envoys in Lisbon\r\nwill add a month to our session; because all that the eastern men are\r\nanxious about, is to get away before the possibility of a treaty's coming\r\nin upon us.\r\n\r\nPresent my respectful salutations to Mrs. Madison, and be assured of my\r\nconstant and affectionate esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HAWKINS.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, March 14, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had twice before attempted to open a correspondence by\r\nwriting unto you, but receiving no answer, I took it for granted my\r\nletters did not reach you, and consequently that no communication could\r\nbe found. Yesterday, however, your nephew put into my hands your favor\r\nof January 23d, and informs me that a letter sent by post by way of Fort\r\nWilkinson, will be certain of getting safely to you. Still, I expect your\r\nlong absence from this part of the States, has rendered occurrences here\r\nbut little interesting to you. Indeed, things have so much changed their\r\naspect, it is like a new world. Those who know us only from 1775 to 1793\r\ncan form no better idea of us now than of the inhabitants of the moon; I\r\nmean as to political matters. Of these, therefore, I shall not say one\r\nword, because nothing I could say, would be any more intelligible to\r\nyou, if said in English, than if said in Hebrew. On your part, however,\r\nyou have interesting details to give us. I particularly take great\r\ninterest in whatever respects the Indians, and the present state of the\r\nCreeks, mentioned in your letter, is very interesting. But you must not\r\nsuppose that your official communications will ever be seen or known out\r\nof the offices. Reserve as to all their proceedings is the fundamental\r\nmaxim of the Executive department. I must, therefore, ask from you one\r\ncommunication to be made to me separately, and I am encouraged to it\r\nby that part of your letter which promises me something on the Creek\r\nlanguage. I have long believed we can never get any information of the\r\nancient history of the Indians, of their descent and filiation, but from\r\na knowledge and comparative view of their languages. I have, therefore,\r\nnever failed to avail myself of any opportunity which offered of getting\r\ntheir vocabularies. I have now made up a large collection, and afraid to\r\nrisk it any longer, lest by some accident it might be lost, I am about to\r\nprint it. But I still want the great southern languages, Cherokee, Creeks,\r\nChoctaw, Chickasaw. For the Cherokee, I have written to another, but for\r\nthe three others, I have no chance but through yourself. I have indeed an\r\nimperfect vocabulary of the Choctaw, but it wants all the words marked\r\nin the enclosed vocabulary[13] with either this mark (*) or this (†).\r\nI therefore throw myself on you to procure me the Creek, Choctaw, and\r\nChickasaw; and I enclose you a vocabulary of the particular words I want.\r\nYou need not take the trouble of having any others taken, because all my\r\nother vocabularies are confined to these words, and my object is only a\r\ncomparative view. The Creek column I expect you will be able to fill up\r\nat once, and when done I should wish it to come on without waiting for\r\nthe others. As to the Choctaw and Chickasaw, I know your relations are\r\nnot very direct, but as I possess no means at all of getting at them, I\r\nam induced to pray your aid. All the despatch which can be conveniently\r\nused is desirable to me, because this summer I propose to arrange all my\r\nvocabularies for the press, and I wish to place every tongue in the column\r\nadjacent to its kindred tongues. Your letters, addressed by post to me at\r\nMonticello, near Charlottesville, will come safely, and more safely than\r\nif put under cover to any of the offices, where they may be mislaid or\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nYour old friend, Mrs. Trist, is now settled at Charlottesville, within\r\ntwo and a half miles of me. She lives with her son, who married here,\r\nand removed there. She preserves her health and spirits fully, and is\r\nmuch beloved with us, as she deserves to be. As I know she is a favorite\r\ncorrespondent of yours, I shall observe that the same channel will be a\r\ngood one to her as I have mentioned for myself. Indeed, if you find our\r\ncorrespondence worth having, it can now be as direct as if you were in\r\none of these States. Mr. Madison is well. I presume you have long known of\r\nhis marriage. He is not yet a father. Mr. Giles is happily and wealthily\r\nmarried to a Miss Tabb. This I presume is enough for a first dose; after\r\nhearing from you, and knowing how it agrees with you, it may be repeated.\r\nWith sentiments of constant and sincere esteem, I am, dear Sir, your\r\naffectionate friend and servant.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [13] [This vocabulary is missing.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. N. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                               PHILADELPHIA, April 7, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is too early to think of a declaratory act as yet, but the\r\ntime is approaching and not distant. Two elections more will give us a\r\nsolid majority in the House of Representatives, and a sufficient one in\r\nthe Senate. As soon as it can be depended on, we must have \"a Declaration\r\nof the principles of the Constitution\" in nature of a Declaration of\r\nrights, in all the points in which it has been violated. The people in\r\nthe middle States are almost rallied to Virginia already; and the eastern\r\nStates are commencing the vibration which has been checked by X. Y. Z.\r\nNorth Carolina is at present in the most dangerous state. The lawyers all\r\ntories, the people substantially republican, but uninformed and deceived\r\nby the lawyers, who are elected of necessity because few other candidates.\r\nThe medicine for that State must be very mild and secretly administered.\r\nBut nothing should be spared to give them true information. I am, dear\r\nSir, yours affectionately.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. LIVINGSTON, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              PHILADELPHIA, April 30, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received with great pleasure your favor of the 11th instant.\r\nBy this time I presume the result of your labors is known with you,\r\nthough not here. Whatever it may be, and my experience of the art,\r\nindustry, and resources of the other party has not permitted me to be\r\nprematurely confident, yet I am entirely confident that ultimately the\r\ngreat body of the people are passing over from them. This may require one\r\nor two elections more; but it will assuredly take place. The madness and\r\nextravagance of their career is what ensures it. The people through all\r\nthe States are for republican forms; republican principles, simplicity,\r\neconomy, religious and civil freedom.\r\n\r\nI have nothing to offer you but Congressional news. The Judiciary bill is\r\npostponed to the next session; so the Militia; so the Military Academy.\r\nThe bill for the election of the President and Vice President has\r\nundergone much revolution. Marshall made a dexterous manœuvre; he declares\r\nagainst the constitutionality of the Senate's bill, and proposed that the\r\nright of decision of their grand committee should be controllable by the\r\n_concurrent_ votes of the two houses of Congress; but to stand good if\r\nnot rejected by a concurrent vote. You will readily estimate the amount\r\nof this sort of control. The Committee of the House of Representatives,\r\nhowever, took from the Committee the right of giving any opinion,\r\nrequiring them to report facts only, and that the votes returned by the\r\nStates should be counted, unless reported by a concurrent vote of both\r\nhouses. In what form it will pass them or us, cannot be foreseen. Our Jury\r\nbill in Senate will pass so as merely to accommodate New York and Vermont.\r\nThe House of Representatives sent us yesterday a bill for incorporating\r\na company to work Roosewell's copper mines in New Jersey. I do not know\r\nwhether it is understood that the Legislature of Jersey was incompetent\r\nto this, or merely that we have concurrent legislation under the sweeping\r\nclause. Congress are authorized to defend the nation. Ships are necessary\r\nfor defence; copper is necessary for ships; mines necessary for copper;\r\na company necessary to work mines; and who can doubt this reasoning who\r\nhas ever played at \"This is the House that Jack built?\" Under such a\r\nprocess of filiation of necessities the sweeping clause makes clean work.\r\nWe shall certainly rise on the 12th. There is nothing to do now but to\r\npass the Ways and Means, and to settle some differences of opinion of the\r\ntwo houses on the Georgia bill, the bill for dividing the North-Western\r\nTerritory, and that for the sale of the Western lands. Salutations and\r\naffectionate esteem. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                PHILADELPHIA, May 12, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Congress will rise to-day or to-morrow. Mr. Nicholas proposing\r\nto call on you, you will get from him the Congressional news. On the\r\nwhole, the federalists have not been able to carry a single strong measure\r\nin the lower House the whole session. When they met, it was believed\r\nthey had a majority of twenty; but many of these were new and moderate\r\nmen, and soon saw the true character of the party to which they had been\r\nwell disposed while at a distance. This tide, too, of public opinion sets\r\nso strongly against the federal proceedings, that this melted off their\r\nmajority, and dismayed the heroes of the party. The Senate alone remained\r\nundismayed to the last. Firm to their purpose, regardless of public\r\nopinion, and more disposed to coerce than to court it, not a man of their\r\nmajority gave way in the least; and on the election bill they _adhered_ to\r\nJohn Marshall's amendment, by their whole number; and if there had been\r\na full Senate, there would have been but eleven votes against it, which\r\ninclude H. Marshall, who has voted with the republicans this session.\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of constant and affectionate esteem to Mrs. Madison and\r\nyourself from, dear Sir, your sincere friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GIDEON GRANGER.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 13, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received with great pleasure your favor of June the 4th, and\r\nam much comforted by the appearance of a change of opinion in your State;\r\nfor though we may obtain, and I believe shall obtain, a majority in the\r\nLegislature of the United States, attached to the preservation of the\r\nfederal Constitution according to its obvious principles, and those on\r\nwhich it was known to be received; attached equally to the preservation\r\nto the States of those rights unquestionably remaining with them; friends\r\nto the freedom of religion, freedom of the press, trial by jury and to\r\neconomical government; opposed to standing armies, paper systems, war, and\r\nall connection, other than commerce, with any foreign nation; in short,\r\na majority firm in all those principles which we have espoused and the\r\nfederalists have opposed uniformly; still, should the whole body of New\r\nEngland continue in opposition to these principles of government, either\r\nknowingly or through delusion, our government will be a very uneasy one.\r\nIt can never be harmonious and solid, while so respectable a portion of\r\nits citizens support principles which go directly to a change of the\r\nfederal Constitution, to sink the State governments, consolidate them\r\ninto one, and to monarchize that. Our country is too large to have all\r\nits affairs directed by a single government. Public servants at such a\r\ndistance, and from under the eye of their constituents, must, from the\r\ncircumstance of distance, be unable to administer and overlook all the\r\ndetails necessary for the good government of the citizens, and the same\r\ncircumstance, by rendering detection impossible to their constituents,\r\nwill invite the public agents to corruption, plunder and waste. And I\r\ndo verily believe, that if the principle were to prevail, of a common\r\nlaw being in force in the United States, (which principle possesses the\r\nGeneral Government at once of all the powers of the State governments,\r\nand reduces us to a single consolidated government,) it would become\r\nthe most corrupt government on the earth. You have seen the practises\r\nby which the public servants have been able to cover their conduct, or,\r\nwhere that could not be done, delusions by which they have varnished it\r\nfor the eye of their constituents. What an augmentation of the field for\r\njobbing, speculating, plundering, office-building and office-hunting would\r\nbe produced by an assumption of all the State powers into the hands of\r\nthe General Government. The true theory of our Constitution is surely the\r\nwisest and best, that the States are independent as to everything within\r\nthemselves, and united as to everything respecting foreign nations. Let\r\nthe General Government be reduced to foreign concerns only, and let our\r\naffairs be disentangled from those of all other nations, except as to\r\ncommerce, which the merchants will manage the better, the more they are\r\nleft free to manage for themselves, and our General Government may be\r\nreduced to a very simple organization, and a very unexpensive one; a few\r\nplain duties to be performed by a few servants. But I repeat, that this\r\nsimple and economical mode of government can never be secured, if the\r\nNew England States continue to support the contrary system. I rejoice,\r\ntherefore, in every appearance of their returning to those principles\r\nwhich I had always imagined to be almost innate in them. In this State,\r\na few persons were deluded by the X. Y. Z. duperies. You saw the effect\r\nof it in our last Congressional representatives, chosen under their\r\ninfluence. This experiment on their credulity is now seen into, and our\r\nnext representation will be as republican as it has heretofore been. On\r\nthe whole, we hope, that by a part of the Union having held on to the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution, time has been given to the States to\r\nrecover from the temporary frenzy into which they had been decoyed, to\r\nrally round the Constitution, and to rescue it from the destruction with\r\nwhich it had been threatened even at their own hands. I see copied from\r\nthe American Magazine two numbers of a paper signed Don Quixotte, most\r\nexcellently adapted to introduce the real truth to the minds even of the\r\nmost prejudiced.\r\n\r\nI would, with great pleasure, have written the letter you desired in\r\nbehalf of your friend, but there are existing circumstances which render a\r\nletter from me to that magistrate as improper as it would be unavailing. I\r\nshall be happy, on some more fortunate occasion, to prove to you my desire\r\nof serving your wishes.\r\n\r\nI sometime ago received a letter from a Mr. M'Gregory of Derby, in your\r\nState; it is written with such a degree of good sense and appearance of\r\ncandor, as entitles it to an answer. Yet the writer being entirely unknown\r\nto me, and the stratagems of the times very multifarious, I have thought\r\nit best to avail myself of your friendship, and enclose the answer to you.\r\nYou will see its nature. If you find from the character of the person to\r\nwhom it is addressed, that no improper use would probably be made of it,\r\nbe so good as to seal and send it. Otherwise suppress it.\r\n\r\nHow will the vote of your State and Rhode Island be as to A. and P.?\r\n\r\nI am, with great and sincere esteem, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO URIAH M'GREGORY.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 13, 1800.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of July the 19th has been received, and received with the\r\ntribute of respect due to a person, who, unurged by motives of personal\r\nfriendship or acquaintance, and unaided by particular information, will so\r\nfar exercise his justice as to advert to the proofs of approbation given a\r\npublic character by his own State and by the United States, and weigh them\r\nin the scale against the fatherless calumnies he hears uttered against\r\nhim. These public acts are known even to those who know nothing of my\r\nprivate life, and surely are better evidence to a mind disposed to truth,\r\nthan slanders which no man will affirm on his own knowledge, or ever saw\r\none who would. From the moment that a portion of my fellow citizens looked\r\ntowards me with a view to one of their highest offices, the floodgates of\r\ncalumny have been opened upon me; not where I am personally known, where\r\ntheir slanders would be instantly judged and suppressed, from a general\r\nsense of their falsehood; but in the remote parts of the Union, where\r\nthe means of detection are not at hand, and the trouble of an inquiry is\r\ngreater than would suit the hearers to undertake. I know that I might have\r\nfilled the courts of the United States with actions for these slanders,\r\nand have ruined perhaps many persons who are not innocent. But this would\r\nbe no equivalent to the loss of character. I leave them, therefore, to the\r\nreproof of their own consciences. If these do not condemn them, there will\r\nyet come a day when the false witness will meet a judge who has not slept\r\nover his slanders. If the reverend Cotton Mather Smith of Shena believed\r\nthis as firmly as I do, he would surely never have affirmed that \"I had\r\nobtained my property by fraud and robbery; that in one instance, I had\r\ndefrauded and robbed a widow and fatherless children of an estate to which\r\nI was executor, of ten thousand pounds sterling, by keeping the property\r\nand paying them in money at the nominal rate, when it was worth no more\r\nthan forty for one; and that all this could be proved.\" Every tittle of\r\nit is fable; there not having existed a single circumstance of my life to\r\nwhich any part of it can hang. I never was executor but in two instances,\r\nboth of which having taken place about the beginning of the revolution,\r\nwhich withdrew me immediately from all private pursuits, I never meddled\r\nin either executorship. In one of the cases only, were there a widow\r\nand children. She was my sister. She retained and managed the estate in\r\nher own hands, and no part of it was ever in mine. In the other, I was\r\na copartner, and only received on a division the equal portion allotted\r\nme. To neither of these executorships therefore, could Mr. Smith refer.\r\nAgain, my property is all patrimonial, except about seven or eight hundred\r\npounds' worth of lands, purchased by myself and paid for, not to widows\r\nand orphans, but to the very gentleman from whom I purchased. If Mr.\r\nSmith, therefore, thinks the precepts of the gospel intended for those who\r\npreach them as well as for others, he will doubtless some day feel the\r\nduties of repentance, and of acknowledgment in such forms as to correct\r\nthe wrong he has done. Perhaps he will have to wait till the passions of\r\nthe moment have passed away. All this is left to his own conscience.\r\n\r\nThese, Sir, are facts, well known to every person in this quarter, which\r\nI have committed to paper for your own satisfaction, and that of those\r\nto whom you may choose to mention them. I only pray that my letter may\r\nnot go out of your own hands, lest it should get into the newspapers,\r\na bear-garden scene into which I have made it a point to enter on no\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\nI am, Sir, your most obedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 23, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of August\r\nthe 22d, and to congratulate you on the healthiness of your city. Still\r\nBaltimore, Norfolk and Providence admonish us that we are not clear of our\r\nnew scourge. When great evils happen, I am in the habit of looking out\r\nfor what good may arise from them as consolations to us, and Providence\r\nhas in fact so established the order of things, as that most evils are the\r\nmeans of producing some good. The yellow fever will discourage the growth\r\nof great cities in our nation, and I view great cities as pestilential to\r\nthe morals, the health and the liberties of man. True, they nourish some\r\nof the elegant arts, but the useful ones can thrive elsewhere, and less\r\nperfection in the others, with more health, virtue and freedom, would be\r\nmy choice.\r\n\r\nI agree with you entirely, in condemning the mania of giving names to\r\nobjects of any kind after persons still living. Death alone can seal\r\nthe title of any man to this honor, by putting it out of his power to\r\nforfeit it. There is one other mode of recording merit, which I have often\r\nthought might be introduced, so as to gratify the living by praising the\r\ndead. In giving, for instance, a commission of Chief Justice to Bushrod\r\nWashington, it should be in consideration of his integrity, and science in\r\nthe laws, and of the services rendered to our country by his illustrious\r\nrelation, &c. A commission to a descendant of Dr. Franklin, besides being\r\nin consideration of the proper qualifications of the person, should add\r\nthat of the great services rendered by his illustrious ancestor, Benjamin\r\nFranklin, by the advancement of science, by inventions useful to man, &c.\r\nI am not sure that we ought to change all our names. And during the regal\r\ngovernment, sometimes, indeed, they were given through adulation; but\r\noften also as the reward of the merit of the times, sometimes for services\r\nrendered the colony. Perhaps, too, a name when given, should be deemed a\r\nsacred property.\r\n\r\nI promised you a letter on Christianity, which I have not forgotten. On\r\nthe contrary, it is because I have reflected on it, that I find much\r\nmore time necessary for it than I can at present dispose of. I have\r\na view of the subject which ought to displease neither the rational\r\nChristian nor Deists, and would reconcile many to a character they have\r\ntoo hastily rejected. I do not know that it would reconcile the _genus\r\nirritabile vatum_ who are all in arms against me. Their hostility is\r\non too interesting ground to be softened. The delusion into which the\r\nX. Y. Z. plot showed it possible to push the people; the successful\r\nexperiment made under the prevalence of that delusion on the clause of the\r\nConstitution, which, while it secured the freedom of the press, covered\r\nalso the freedom of religion, had given to the clergy a very favorite hope\r\nof obtaining an establishment of a particular form of Christianity through\r\nthe United States; and as every sect believes its own form the true one,\r\nevery one perhaps hoped for his own, but especially the Episcopalians and\r\nCongregationalists. The returning good sense of our country threatens\r\nabortion to their hopes, and they believe that any portion of power\r\nconfided to me, will be exerted in opposition to their schemes. And they\r\nbelieve rightly: for I have sworn upon the altar of God, eternal hostility\r\nagainst every form of tyranny over the mind of man. But this is all they\r\nhave to fear from me: and enough too in their opinion. And this is the\r\ncause of their printing lying pamphlets against me, forging conversations\r\nfor me with Mazzei, Bishop Madison, &c., which are absolute falsehoods\r\nwithout a circumstance of truth to rest on; falsehoods, too, of which I\r\nacquit Mazzei and Bishop Madison, for they are men of truth.\r\n\r\nBut enough of this: it is more than I have before committed to paper on\r\nthe subject of all the lies that have been preached and printed against\r\nme. I have not seen the work of Sonnoni which you mention, but I have seen\r\nanother work on Africa, (Parke's,) which I fear will throw cold water\r\non the hopes of the friends of freedom. You will hear an account of an\r\nattempt at insurrection in this State. I am looking with anxiety to see\r\nwhat will be its effect on our State. We are truly to be pitied. I fear we\r\nhave little chance to see you at the federal city or in Virginia, and as\r\nlittle at Philadelphia. It would be a great treat to receive you here. But\r\nnothing but sickness could effect that; so I do not wish it. For I wish\r\nyou health and happiness, and think of you with affection. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 14, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your former communications on the subject of the steam engine,\r\nI took the liberty of laying before the American Philosophical Society,\r\nby whom they will be printed in their volume of the present year. I have\r\nheard of the discovery of some large bones, supposed to be of the mammoth,\r\nat about thirty or forty miles distance from you; and among the bones\r\nfound, are said to be some of which we have never been able to procure.\r\nThe first interesting question is, whether they are the bones of the\r\nmammoth? The second, what are the particular bones, and could I possibly\r\nprocure them? The bones I am most anxious to obtain, are those of the head\r\nand feet, which are said to be among those found in your State, as also\r\nthe ossa innominata, and the scapula. Others would also be interesting,\r\nthough similar ones may be possessed, because they would show by their\r\nsimilarity that the set belong to the mammoth. Could I so far venture\r\nto trouble you on this subject, as to engage some of your friends near\r\nthe place, to procure for me the bones above mentioned? If they are\r\nto be bought I will gladly pay for them whatever you shall agree to as\r\nreasonable; and will place the money in New York as instantaneously after\r\nit is made known to me, as the post can carry it, as I will all expenses\r\nof package, transportation, &c., to New York and Philadelphia, where they\r\nmay be addressed to John Barnes, whose agent (he not being on the spot)\r\nwill take care of them for me.\r\n\r\nBut I have still a more important subject whereon to address you. Though\r\nour information of the votes of the several States be not official,\r\nyet they are stated on such evidence as to satisfy both parties that\r\nthe republican vote has been successful. We may, therefore, venture to\r\nhazard propositions on that hypothesis without being justly subjected\r\nto raillery or ridicule. The Constitution to which we are all attached\r\nwas meant to be republican, and we believe to be republican according\r\nto every candid interpretation. Yet we have seen it so interpreted and\r\nadministered, as to be truly what the French have called, a _monarchie\r\nmasque_. Yet so long has the vessel run on this way and been trimmed to\r\nit, that to put her on her republican tack will require all the skill,\r\nthe firmness and the zeal of her ablest and best friends. It is a crisis\r\nwhich calls on them, to sacrifice all other objects, and repair to her aid\r\nin this momentous operation. Not only their skill is wanting, but their\r\nnames also. It is essential to assemble in the outset persons to compose\r\nour administration, whose talents, integrity and revolutionary name and\r\nprinciples may inspire the nation at once, with unbounded confidence,\r\nand impose an awful silence on all the maligners of republicanism; as\r\nmay suppress in embryo the purpose avowed by one of their most daring\r\nand effective chiefs, of beating down the administration. These names do\r\nnot abound at this day. So few are they, that yours, my friend, cannot\r\nbe spared among them without leaving a blank which cannot be filled. If\r\nI can obtain for the public the aid of those I have contemplated, I fear\r\nnothing. If this cannot be done, then are we unfortunate indeed! We shall\r\nbe unable to realize the prospects which have been held out to the people,\r\nand we must fall back into monarchism, for want of heads, not hands to\r\nhelp us out of it. This is a common cause, my dear Sir, common to all\r\nrepublicans. Though I have been too honorably placed in front of those\r\nwho are to enter the breach so happily made, yet the energies of every\r\nindividual are necessary, and in the very place where his energies can\r\nmost serve the enterprise. I can assure you that your colleagues will be\r\nmost acceptable to you; one of them, whom you cannot mistake, peculiarly\r\nso. The part which circumstances constrain us to propose to you is, the\r\nsecretaryship of the navy. These circumstances cannot be explained by\r\nletter. Republicanism is so rare in those parts which possess nautical\r\nskill, that I cannot find it allied there to the other qualifications.\r\nThough you are not nautical by profession, yet your residence and your\r\nmechanical science qualify you as well as a gentleman can possibly be, and\r\nsufficiently to enable you to choose under-agents perfectly qualified,\r\nand to superintend their conduct. Come forward then, my dear Sir, and\r\ngive us the aid of your talents and the weight of your character towards\r\nthe new establishment of republicanism: I say, for its new establishment;\r\nfor hitherto we have only seen its travestie. I have urged thus far, on\r\nthe belief that your present office would not be an obstacle to this\r\nproposition. I was informed, and I think it was by your brother, that\r\nyou wished to retire from it, and were only restrained by the fear that a\r\nsuccessor of different principles might be appointed. The late change in\r\nyour council of appointment will remove this fear. It will not be improper\r\nto say a word on the subject of expense. The gentlemen who composed\r\nGeneral Washington's first administration took up, too universally, a\r\npractice of general entertainment, which was unnecessary, obstructive of\r\nbusiness, and so oppressive to themselves, that it was among the motives\r\nfor their retirement. Their successors profited by the experiment, and\r\nlived altogether as private individuals, and so have ever continued to do.\r\nHere, indeed, it cannot be otherwise, our situation being so rural, that\r\nduring the vacations of the Legislature we shall have no society but of\r\nthe officers of the government, and in time of sessions the Legislature is\r\nbecome and becoming so numerous, that for the last half dozen years nobody\r\nbut the President has pretended to entertain them. I have been led to make\r\nthe application before official knowledge of the result of our election,\r\nbecause the return of Mr. Van Benthuysen, one of your electors and\r\nneighbors, offers me a safe conveyance at a moment when the post offices\r\nwill be peculiarly suspicious and prying. Your answer may come by post\r\nwithout danger, if directed in some other hand writing than your own; and\r\nI will pray you to give me an answer as soon as you can make up your mind.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of cordial esteem and respect, and my friendly\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BURR.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 15, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Although we have not official information of the votes for\r\nPresident and Vice President, and cannot have until the first week\r\nin February, yet the state of the votes is given on such evidence, as\r\nsatisfies both parties that the two republican candidates stand highest.\r\nFrom South Carolina we have not even heard of the actual vote; but we have\r\nlearned who were appointed electors, and with sufficient certainty how\r\nthey would vote. It is said they would withdraw from yourself one vote. It\r\nhas also been said that a General Smith, of Tennessee, had declared that\r\nhe would give his second vote to Mr. Gallatin, not from any indisposition\r\ntowards you, but extreme reverence to the character of Mr. Gallatin. It\r\nis also surmised that the vote of Georgia will not be entire. Yet nobody\r\npretends to know these things of a certainty, and we know enough to\r\nbe certain that what it is surmised will be withheld, will still leave\r\nyou four or five votes at least above Mr. Adams. However, it was badly\r\nmanaged not to have arranged with certainty what seems to have been left\r\nto hazard. It was the more material, because I understand several of the\r\nhigh-flying federalists have expressed their hope that the two republican\r\ntickets may be equal, and their determination in that case to prevent a\r\nchoice by the House of Representatives, (which they are strong enough to\r\ndo,) and let the government devolve on a President of the Senate. Decency\r\nrequired that I should be so entirely passive during the late contest that\r\nI never once asked whether arrangements had been made to prevent so many\r\nfrom dropping votes intentionally, as might frustrate half the republican\r\nwish; nor did I doubt, till lately, that such had been made.\r\n\r\nWhile I must congratulate you, my dear Sir, on the issue of this contest,\r\nbecause it is more honorable, and doubtless more grateful to you than any\r\nstation within the competence of the chief magistrate, yet for myself, and\r\nfor the substantial service of the public, I feel most sensibly the loss\r\nwe sustain of your aid in our new administration. It leaves a chasm in\r\nmy arrangements, which cannot be adequately filled up. I had endeavored\r\nto compose an administration whose talents, integrity, names, and\r\ndispositions, should at once inspire unbounded confidence in the public\r\nmind, and insure a perfect harmony in the conduct of the public business.\r\nI lose you from the list, and am not sure of all the others. Should the\r\ngentlemen who possess the public confidence decline taking a part in their\r\naffairs, and force us to take persons unknown to the people, the evil\r\ngenius of this country may realize his avowal that \"he will beat down the\r\nadministration.\" The return of Mr. Van Benthuysen, one of your electors,\r\nfurnishes me a confidential opportunity of writing this much to you, which\r\nI should not have ventured through the post office at this prying season.\r\nWe shall of course see you before the 4th of March. Accept my respectful\r\nand affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE BRECKENRIDGE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 18, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received, while at home, the letter you were so kind as\r\nto write me. The employments of the country have such irresistible\r\nattractions for me, that while I am at home, I am not very punctual\r\nin acknowledging the letters of my friends. Having no refuge here from\r\nmy room and writing-table, it is my regular season for fetching up the\r\nlee-way of my correspondence.\r\n\r\nBefore you receive this, you will have understood that the State of South\r\nCarolina (the only one about which there was uncertainty) has given a\r\nrepublican vote, and saved us from the consequences of the annihilation\r\nof Pennsylvania. But we are brought into dilemma by the probable equality\r\nof the two republican candidates. The federalists in Congress mean to\r\ntake advantage of this, and either to prevent an election altogether, or\r\nreverse what has been understood to have been the wishes of the people,\r\nas to the President and Vice President; wishes which the Constitution\r\ndid not permit them specially to designate. The latter alternative still\r\ngives us a republican administration. The former, a suspension of the\r\nfederal government, for want of a head. This opens to us an abyss, at\r\nwhich every sincere patriot must shudder. General Davie has arrived here\r\nwith the treaty formed (under the name of a convention) with France. It\r\nis now before the Senate for ratification, and will encounter objections.\r\nHe believes firmly that a continental peace in Europe will take place, and\r\nthat England also may be comprehended.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of the great respect of, dear Sir, your most obedient\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 19, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Brown's departure for Virginia enables me to write\r\nconfidentially what I could not have ventured by the post at this prying\r\nseason. The election in South Carolina has in some measure decided\r\nthe great contest. Though as yet we do not know the actual votes of\r\nTennessee, Kentucky, and Vermont, yet we believe the votes to be on the\r\nwhole, J. seventy-three, B. seventy-three, A. sixty-five, P. sixty-four.\r\nRhode Island withdrew one from P. There is a possibility that Tennessee\r\nmay withdraw one from B., and Burr writes that there may be one vote\r\nin Vermont for J. But I hold the latter impossible, and the former not\r\nprobable; and that there will be an absolute parity between the two\r\nrepublican candidates. This has produced great dismay and gloom on the\r\nrepublican gentlemen here, and exultation in the federalists, who openly\r\ndeclare they will prevent an election, and will name a President of the\r\nSenate, _pro tem._ by what they say would only be a _stretch_ of the\r\nConstitution. The prospect of preventing this, is as follows: Georgia,\r\nNorth Carolina, Tennessee, Kentucky, Vermont, Pennsylvania, and New York,\r\ncan be counted on for their vote in the House of Representatives, and it\r\nis thought by some that Baer of Maryland, and Linn of New Jersey will\r\ncome over. Some even count on Morris of Vermont. But you must know the\r\nuncertainty of such a dependence under the operation of caucuses and other\r\nfederal engines. The month of February, therefore, will present us storms\r\nof a new character. Should they have a particular issue, I hope you will\r\nbe here a day or two, at least, before the 4th of March. I know that your\r\nappearance on the scene before the departure of Congress, would assuage\r\nthe minority, and inspire in the majority confidence and joy unbounded,\r\nwhich they would spread far and wide on their journey home. Let me beseech\r\nyou then to come with a view of staying perhaps a couple of weeks, within\r\nwhich time things might be put into such a train, as would permit us\r\nboth to go home for a short time, for removal. I wrote to R. R. L. by a\r\nconfidential hand three days ago. The person proposed for the Treasury has\r\nnot come yet.\r\n\r\nDavie is here with the Convention, as it is called; but it is a real\r\ntreaty, and without limitation of time. It has some disagreeable\r\nfeatures, and will endanger the compromising us with Great Britain. I\r\nam not at liberty to mention its contents, but I believe it will meet\r\nwith opposition from both sides of the House. It has been a bungling\r\nnegotiation. Ellsworth remains in France for the benefit of his health.\r\nHe has resigned his office of Chief Justice. Putting these two things\r\ntogether, we cannot misconstrue his views. He must have had great\r\nconfidence in Mr. Adams' continuance to risk such a certainty as he\r\nheld. Jay was yesterday nominated Chief Justice. We were afraid of\r\nsomething worse. A scheme of government for the territory is cooking\r\nby a committee of each House, under separate authorities, but probably\r\na voluntary harmony. They let out no hints. It is believed that the\r\njudiciary system will not be pushed, as the appointments, if made by the\r\npresent administration, could not fall on those who create them. But I\r\nvery much fear the road system will be urged. The mines of Peru would not\r\nsupply the moneys which would be wasted on this object, nor the patience\r\nof any people stand the abuses which would be incontrollably committed\r\nunder it. I propose, as soon as the state of the election is perfectly\r\nascertained, to aim at a candid understanding with Mr. Adams. I do not\r\nexpect that either his feelings or his views of interest will oppose it.\r\nI hope to induce in him dispositions liberal and accommodating. Accept my\r\naffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 26, 1800.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--All the votes have now come in, except of Vermont and\r\nKentucky, and there is no doubt that the result is a perfect parity\r\nbetween the two republican characters. The federalists appear determined\r\nto prevent an election, and to pass a bill giving the government to\r\nMr. Jay, appointed Chief Justice, or to Marshall as Secretary of State.\r\nYet I am rather of opinion that Maryland and Jersey will give the seven\r\nrepublican majorities. The French treaty will be violently opposed by the\r\nfederalists; the giving up the vessels is the article they cannot swallow.\r\nThey have got their judiciary bill forwarded to commitment. I dread this\r\nabove all the measures meditated, because appointments in the nature of\r\nfreehold render it difficult to undo what is done. We expect a report for\r\na territorial government which is to pay little respect to the rights of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCordial and affectionate salutations. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TENCHE COXE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                         December 31, 1800.\r\n\r\nI shall neither frank nor subscribe my letter, because I do not choose to\r\ncommit myself to the fidelity of the post-office. For the same reason,\r\nI have avoided putting pen to paper through the whole summer, except on\r\nmere business, because I knew it was a prying season. I received from time\r\nto time papers under your superscription, which showed that our friends\r\nwere not inattentive to the great operation which was agitating the\r\nnation. You are by this time apprised of the embarrassment produced by the\r\nequality of votes between the two republican candidates. The contrivance\r\nin the Constitution for marking the votes works badly, because it does\r\nnot enounce precisely the true expression of the public will. We do not\r\nsee what is to be the issue of the present difficulty. The federalists,\r\namong whom those of the republican section are not the strongest, propose\r\nto prevent an election in Congress, and to transfer the government by\r\nan act to the C. J. (Jay) or Secretary of State, or to let it devolve on\r\nthe President _pro tem._ of the Senate, till next December, which gives\r\nthem another year's predominance, and the chances of future events. The\r\nrepublicans propose to press forward to an election. If they fail in this,\r\na concert between the two higher candidates may prevent the dissolution\r\nof the government and danger of anarchy, by an operation, bungling indeed\r\nand imperfect, but better than letting the Legislature take the nomination\r\nof the Executive entirely from the people. Excuse the infrequency of my\r\nacknowledgments of your kind attentions. The danger of interruption makes\r\nit prudent for me not to indulge my personal wishes in that way. I pray\r\nyou to accept assurances of my great esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. WILLIAMSON.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 10, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I should sooner have acknowledged your favor of December\r\n8th, but for a growing and pressing correspondence which I can scarcely\r\nmanage. I was particularly happy to receive the diary of Quebec, as\r\nabout the same time I happened to receive one from the Natchez, so as\r\nto be able to make a comparison of them. The result was a wonder that\r\nany human being should remain in a cold country who could find room in\r\na warm one,--should prefer 32º to 55º. Harry Hill has told me that the\r\ntemperature of Madeira is generally from 55º to 65º, its extreme about\r\n50º and 70º. If I ever change my climate for health, it should be for\r\nthat Island. I do not know that the coincidence has ever been remarked\r\nbetween the new moon and the greater degrees of cold, or the full moon and\r\nthe lesser degrees; or that the reflected beams of the moon attemper the\r\nweather at all. On the contrary, I think I have understood that the most\r\npowerful concave mirror presented to the moon, and throwing its focus on\r\nthe bulb of a thermometer, does not in the least effect it. I suppose the\r\nopinion to be universal that the turkey is a native of America. Nobody,\r\nas far as I know, has ever contradicted it but Daines Barrington; and the\r\narguments he produces are such as none but a head, entangled and kinked as\r\nhis is, would ever have urged. Before the discovery of America, no such\r\nbird is mentioned in a single author, all those quoted by Barrington,\r\nby description referring to the crane, hen, pheasant or peacock; but the\r\nbook of every traveller, who came to America soon after its discovery, is\r\nfull of accounts of the turkey and its abundance; and immediately after\r\nthat discovery we find the turkey served up at the feasts of Europe, as\r\ntheir most extraordinary rarity. Mr. William Strickland, the eldest son\r\nof St. George Strickland, of York, in England, told me the anecdote.\r\nSome ancestor of his commanded a vessel in the navigations of Cabot.\r\nHaving occasion to consult the Herald's office concerning his family, he\r\nfound a petition from that ancestor to the crown, stating that Cabot's\r\ncircumstances being slender, he had been rewarded by the bounties he\r\nneeded from the crown; that as to himself, he asked nothing in that way,\r\nbut that as a consideration for his services in the same way, he might\r\nbe permitted to assume for the crest of his family arms, the turkey, an\r\nAmerican bird; and Mr. Strickland observed that their crest is actually a\r\nturkey. You ask whether we may be quoted. In the first place, I now state\r\nthe thing from memory, and may be inexact in some small circumstances. Mr.\r\nStrickland too, stated it to me in a conversation, and not considering\r\nit of importance, might be inexact too. We should both dislike to be\r\nquestioned before the public for any little inaccuracy of style or\r\nrecollection. I think if you were to say that the Herald's office may\r\nbe referred to in proof of the fact, it would be authority sufficient,\r\nwithout naming us. I have at home a note of Mr. Strickland's information,\r\nwhich I then committed to paper. My situation does not allow me to refresh\r\nmy memory from this. I shall be glad to see your book make its appearance;\r\nand I am sure it will be well received by the Philosophical part of\r\nthe world, for I still dare to use the word philosophy, notwithstanding\r\nthe war waged against it by bigotry and despotism. Health, respect and\r\nfriendly salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM DUNBAR, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 12, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of July 14th, with the papers accompanying it,\r\ncame safely to hand about the last of October. That containing remarks on\r\nthe line of demarcation I perused according to your permission, and with\r\ngreat satisfaction, and then enclosed to a friend in Philadelphia, to be\r\nforwarded to its address. The papers addressed to me, I took the liberty\r\nof communicating to the Philosophical Society. That on the language by\r\nsigns is quite new. Soon after receiving your meteorological diary, I\r\nreceived one of Quebec; and was struck with the comparison between -32 and\r\n19¾ the lowest depression of the thermometer at Quebec and the Natchez. I\r\nhave often wondered that any human being should live in a cold country who\r\ncan find room in a warm one. I have no doubt but that cold is the source\r\nof more sufferance to all animal nature than hunger, thirst, sickness, and\r\nall the other pains of life and of death itself put together. I live in a\r\ntemperate climate, and under circumstances which do not expose me often\r\nto cold. Yet when I recollect on one hand all the sufferings I have had\r\nfrom cold, and on the other all my other pains, the former preponderate\r\ngreatly. What then must be the sum of that evil if we take in the vast\r\nproportion of men who are obliged to be out in all weather, by land and by\r\nsea, all the families of beasts, birds, reptiles, and even the vegetable\r\nkingdom! for that too has life, and where there is life there may be\r\nsensation. I remark a rainbow of a great portion of the circle observed\r\nby you when on the line of demarcation. I live in a situation which has\r\ngiven me an opportunity of seeing more than the semicircle often. I am\r\non a hill five hundred feet perpendicularly high. On the west side it\r\nbreaks down abruptly to the base, where a river passes through. A rainbow,\r\ntherefore, about sunset, plunges one of its legs down to the river, five\r\nhundred feet below the level of the eye on the top of the hill. I have\r\ntwice seen bows formed by the moon. They were of the color of the common\r\ncircle round the moon, and were very near, being within a few paces of\r\nme in both instances. I thank you for the little vocabularies of Bedais,\r\nTankawis and Teghas. I have it much at heart to make as extensive a\r\ncollection as possible of the Indian tongues. I have at present about\r\nthirty tolerably full, among which the number radically different, is\r\ntruly wonderful. It is curious to consider how such handfuls of men, came\r\nby different languages, and how they have preserved them so distinct. I at\r\nfirst thought of reducing them all to one orthography, but I soon become\r\nsensible that this would occasion two sources of error instead of one. I\r\ntherefore think it best to keep them in the form of orthography in which\r\nthey were taken, only noting whether that were English, French, German, or\r\nwhat. I have never been a very punctual correspondent, and it is possible\r\nthat new duties may make me less so. I hope I shall not on that account\r\nlose the benefit of your communications. Philosophical vedette at the\r\ndistance of one thousand miles, and on the verge of the terra incognito of\r\nour continent, is precious to us here. I pray you to accept assurances of\r\nmy high consideration and esteem, and friendly salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL BURR.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, February 1, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It was to be expected that the enemy would endeavor to sow\r\ntares between us, that they might divide us and our friends. Every\r\nconsideration satisfies me you will be on your guard against this, as I\r\nassure you I am strongly. I hear of one stratagem so imposing and so base\r\nthat it is proper I should notice it to you. Mr. Munford, who is here,\r\nsays he saw at New York before he left it, an original letter of mine to\r\nJudge Breckenridge, in which are sentiments highly injurious to you. He\r\nknows my hand writing, and did not doubt that to be genuine. I enclose\r\nyou a copy taken from the press copy of the only letter I ever wrote to\r\nJudge Breckenridge in my life: the press copy itself has been shown to\r\nseveral of our mutual friends here. Of consequence, the letter seen by\r\nMr. Munford must be a forgery, and if it contains a sentiment unfriendly\r\nor disrespectful to you, I affirm it solemnly to be a forgery; as also\r\nif it varies from the copy enclosed. With the common trash of slander I\r\nshould not think of troubling you; but the forgery of one's handwriting is\r\ntoo imposing to be neglected. A mutual knowledge of each other furnishes\r\nus with the best test of the contrivances which will be practised by the\r\nenemies of both.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR M'KEAN.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 2d, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have long waited for an opportunity to acknowledge the\r\nreceipt of your favor of December the 15th, as well as that by Dr.\r\nMendenhall. None occurring, I shall either deliver the present to General\r\nMuhlenburg or put it under cover to Doctor Wistar, to whom I happen\r\nto be writing, to be sent to your house in Philadelphia, or forwarded\r\nconfidentially to Lancaster.\r\n\r\nThe event of the election is still _in dubio_. A strong portion in the\r\nHouse of Representatives will prevent an election if they can. I rather\r\nbelieve they will not be able to do it, as there are six individuals of\r\nmoderate character, any one of whom coming over to the republican vote\r\nwill make a ninth State. Till this is known, it is too soon for me to\r\nsay what should be done in such atrocious cases as those you mention of\r\nfederal officers obstructing the operation of the State governments. One\r\nthing I will say, that as to the future, interferences with elections,\r\nwhether of the State or General Government, by officers of the latter,\r\nshould be deemed cause of removal; because the constitutional remedy\r\nby the elective principle becomes nothing, if it may be smothered by\r\nthe enormous patronage of the General Government. How far it may be\r\npracticable, prudent or proper, to look back, is too great a question\r\nto be decided but by the united wisdom of the whole administration when\r\nformed. Our situation is so different from yours, that it may render\r\nproper some differences in the practice. Your State is a single body, the\r\nmajority clearly one way. Ours is of sixteen integral parts, some of them\r\nall one way, some all the other, some divided. Whatever may be decided\r\nas to the past, they shall give no trouble to the State governments in\r\nfuture, if it shall depend on me; and be assured, particularly as to\r\nyourself, that I should consider the most perfect harmony and interchange\r\nof accommodations and good offices with those governments as among the\r\nfirst objects.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high consideration, respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. WISTAR.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, February 3, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--According to your desire I wrote to Chancellor Livingston on\r\nthe subject of the bones. The following is an extract from his letter\r\ndated January 7th. \"I have paid the earliest attention to your request\r\nrelative to the bones found at Shawangun, and have this day written to\r\na very intelligent friend in that neighborhood. I fear however that\r\ntill they have finished their search, there will be some difficulty\r\nin procuring any part of the bones, because when I first heard of the\r\ndiscovery I made some attempts to possess myself of them, but found they\r\nwere a kind of common property, the whole town having joined in digging\r\nfor them till they were stopped by the autumnal rains. They entertain\r\nwell-grounded hopes of discovering the whole skeleton, since these bones\r\nare not, like all those they have hitherto found in that county, placed\r\nwithin the vegetable world, but are covered with a stratum of clay,--that\r\nbeing sheltered from the air and water they are more perfectly preserved.\r\nAmong the bones I have heard mentioned, are the vertebra, part of the jaw,\r\nwith two of the grinders, the tusks, which some have called the horns,\r\nthe sternum, the scapula, the tibia and fibula, the tarsus and metatarsus.\r\nWhether any of the phalanges or innominata are found, I have not heard. A\r\npart of the head, containing the socket of the tusks, is also discovered.\r\nFrom the bones of the feet, it is evidently a claw-footed animal, and from\r\nsuch parts of the shoulder bones as have been discovered, it appears that\r\nthe arm or fore-leg, had a greater motion than can possibly belong to the\r\nelephant or any of the large quadrupeds with which we are acquainted.\r\nSince bog-earth has been used by the farmers of Ulster county for a\r\nmanure, which is subsequent to the war, fragments of at least eight or ten\r\nhave been found, but in a very decayed state in the same bog.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this extract, and the circumstance that the bones belong to the\r\ntown, you will be sensible of the difficulty of obtaining any considerable\r\nportion of them. I refer to yourself to consider whether it would not be\r\nbetter to select such only of which we have no specimens, and to ask them\r\nonly. It is not unlikely they would with common consent yield a particular\r\nbone or bones, provided they may keep the mass for their own town. If you\r\nwill make the selection and communicate it to me, I will forward it to the\r\nChancellor, and the sooner the better.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high consideration and attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TENCHE COXE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 11, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of January the 25th came to hand some days ago, and\r\nyesterday a gentleman put into my hand, at the door of the Senate chamber,\r\nthe volume of the American Museum for 1798. As no letter accompanied it,\r\nI took it for granted it was to bring under my eye some of its contents. I\r\nhave gone over it with satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThis is the morning of the election by the House of Representatives.\r\nFor some time past a single individual had declared he would by his vote\r\nmake up the ninth State. On Saturday last he changed, and it stands at\r\npresent eight one way, six the other, and two divided. Which of the two\r\nwill be elected, and whether either, I deem perfectly problematical: and\r\nmy mind has long been equally made up for either of the three events. If\r\nI can find out the person who brought me the volume from you, I shall\r\nreturn it by him, because I presume it makes one of a set. If not by\r\nhim, I will find some other person who may convey it to Philadelphia if\r\nnot to Lancaster. Very possibly it may go by a different conveyance from\r\nthis letter. Very probably you will learn before the receipt of either,\r\nthe result, or progress at least, of the election. We see already at the\r\nthreshold, that if it falls on me, I shall be embarrassed by finding the\r\noffices vacant, which cannot be even temporarily filled but with advice\r\nof Senate, and that body is called on the fourth of March, when it is\r\nimpossible for the new members of Kentucky, Georgia and South Carolina\r\nto receive notice in time to be here. The summons for Kentucky, dated,\r\nas all were, January the 31st, could not go hence till the 5th, and that\r\nfor Georgia did not go till the 6th. If the difficulties of the election,\r\ntherefore, are got over, there are more and more behind, until new\r\nelections shall have regenerated the constituted authorities. The defects\r\nof our Constitution under circumstances like the present, appear very\r\ngreat. Accept assurances of the esteem and respect of, dear Sir, your most\r\nobedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. B. S. BARTON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 14, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of January 18th is duly received. The subject of\r\nit did not need apology. On the contrary, should I be placed in office,\r\nnothing would be more desirable to me than the recommendations of those\r\nin whom I have confidence, of persons fit for office; for if the good\r\nwithhold their testimony, we shall be at the mercy of the bad. If the\r\nquestion relative to Mr. Zantzinger had been merely that of remaining in\r\noffice, your letter would have placed him on very safe ground. Besides\r\nthat, no man who has conducted himself according to his duties would have\r\nanything to fear from me, as those who have done ill would have nothing\r\nto hope, be their political principles what they might. The obtaining an\r\nappointment presents more difficulties. The republicans have been excluded\r\nfrom all offices from the first origin of the division into Republican and\r\nFederalist. They have a reasonable claim to vacancies till they occupy\r\ntheir due share. My hope however is that the distinction will be soon\r\nlost, or at most that it will be only of republican and monarchist: that\r\nthe body of the nation, even that part which French excesses forced over\r\nto the federal side, will rejoin the republicans, leaving only those who\r\nwere pure monarchists, and who will be too few to form a sect. This is\r\nthe fourth day of the ballot, and nothing done; nor do I see any reason to\r\nsuppose the six and a half States here will be less firm, as they call it,\r\nthan your thirteen Senators; if so, and the government should expire on\r\nthe 3d of March by the loss of its head, there is no regular provision for\r\nreorganizing it, nor any authority but in the people themselves. They may\r\nauthorize a convention to reorganize and even amend the machine. There are\r\nten individuals in the House of Representatives, any one of whom changing\r\nhis vote may save us this troublesome operation. Be pleased to present my\r\nfriendly respects to Mrs. Barton, Mrs. Sarjeant, and Mrs. Waters, and to\r\naccept yourself my affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 15, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received several letters from you which have not\r\nbeen acknowledged. By the post I dare not, and one or two confidential\r\nopportunities have passed me by surprise. I have regretted it the less,\r\nbecause I know you could be more safely and fully informed by others. Mr.\r\nTyler, the bearer of this, will give you a great deal more information\r\npersonally than can be done by letter. Four days of balloting have\r\nproduced not a single change of a vote. Yet it is confidently believed by\r\nmost that to-morrow there is to be a coalition. I know of no foundation\r\nfor this belief. However, as Mr. Tyler waits the event of it, he will\r\ncommunicate it to you. If they could have been permitted to pass a law for\r\nputting the government into the hands of an officer, they would certainly\r\nhave prevented an election. But we thought it best to declare openly and\r\nfirmly, one and all, that the day such an act passed, the middle States\r\nwould arm, and that no such usurpation, even for a single day, should be\r\nsubmitted to. This first shook them; and they were completely alarmed at\r\nthe resource for which we declared, to wit, a convention to re-organize\r\nthe government, and to amend it. The very word convention gives them\r\nthe horrors, as in the present democratical spirit of America, they fear\r\nthey should lose some of the favorite morsels of the Constitution. Many\r\nattempts have been made to obtain terms and promises from me. I have\r\ndeclared to them unequivocally, that I would not receive the government\r\non capitulation, that I would not go into it with my hands tied. Should\r\nthey yield the election, I have reason to expect in the outset the\r\ngreatest difficulties as to nominations. The late incumbents running away\r\nfrom their offices and leaving them vacant, will prevent my filling them\r\nwithout the _previous_ advice of Senate. How this difficulty is to be\r\ngot over I know not. Accept for Mrs. Monroe and yourself my affectionate\r\nsalutations. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 18, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Notwithstanding the suspected infidelity of the post, I must\r\nhazard this communication. The minority in the House of Representatives,\r\nafter seeing the impossibility of electing Burr, the certainty that a\r\nlegislative usurpation would be resisted by arms, and a recourse to a\r\nconvention to re-organize and amend the government, held a consultation\r\non this dilemma, whether it would be better for them to come over in a\r\nbody and go with the tide of the times, or by a negative conduct suffer\r\nthe election to be made by a bare majority, keeping their body entire and\r\nunbroken, to act in phalanx on such ground of opposition as circumstances\r\nshall offer; and I know their determination on this question only by\r\ntheir vote of yesterday. Morris of Vermont withdrew, which made Lyon's\r\nvote that of his State. The Maryland federalists put in four blanks,\r\nwhich made the positive ticket of their colleagues the vote of the State.\r\nSouth Carolina and Delaware put in six blanks. So there were ten States\r\nfor one candidate, four for another, and two blanks. We consider this,\r\ntherefore, as a declaration of war, on the part of this band. But their\r\nconduct appears to have brought over to us the whole body of federalists,\r\nwho, being alarmed with the danger of a dissolution of the government,\r\nhad been made most anxiously to wish the very administration they had\r\nopposed, and to view it when obtained, as a child of their own. * * * * *\r\nMr. A. embarrasses us. He keeps the offices of State and War vacant,\r\nbut has named Bayard Minister Plenipotentiary to France, and has called\r\nan unorganized Senate to meet the fourth of March. As you do not like to\r\nbe here on that day, I wish you would come within a day or two after. I\r\nthink that between that and the middle of the month we can so far put\r\nthings under way, as that we may go home to make arrangements for our\r\nfinal removal. Come to Conrad's, where I will bespeak lodgings for you.\r\nYesterday Mr. A. nominated Bayard to be Minister Plenipotentiary of the\r\nUnited States to the French republic; to-day, Theophilus Parsons, Attorney\r\nGeneral of the United States in the room of C. Lee, who, with Keith Taylor\r\n_cum multis aliis_, are appointed judges under the new system. H. G. Otis\r\nis nominated a district attorney. A vessel has been waiting for some\r\ntime in readiness to carry the new minister to France. My affectionate\r\nsalutations to Mrs. Madison.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LIEUTENANT DEARBORN.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 18, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The House of Representatives having yesterday concluded their\r\nchoice of a person for the chair of the United States and willed me that\r\noffice, it now becomes necessary to provide an administration composed\r\nof persons whose qualifications and standing have possessed them of the\r\npublic confidence, and whose wisdom may ensure to our fellow-citizens\r\nthe advantages they sanguinely expect. On a review of the characters\r\nin the different States proper for the different departments, I have\r\nhad no hesitation in considering you as the person to whom it would be\r\nmost advantageous to the public to confide the Department of War. May\r\nI therefore hope, Sir, that you will give your country the aid of your\r\ntalents as Secretary of War? The delay which has attended the election\r\nhas very much abridged our time, and rendered the call more sudden and\r\npressing than I could have wished. I am in hopes our administration may\r\nbe assembled during the first week of March, except yourself, and that\r\nyou can be with us in a few days after. Indeed it is probable we shall be\r\nbut a few days together (perhaps to the middle of the month) to make some\r\ngeneral and pressing arrangements, and then go home, for a short time,\r\nto make our final removal hither. I mention these circumstances that you\r\nmay see the urgency of setting out for this place with the shortest delay\r\npossible, which may be the shorter as you can return again to your family,\r\nas we shall, to make your final arrangements for removal. I hope we shall\r\nnot be disappointed in counting on your aid, and that you will favor us\r\nwith an answer by return of post. Accept assurances of sincere esteem and\r\nhigh respect from, dear Sir, your most obedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MAJOR WILLIAM JACKSON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 18, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 3d instant has been duly received. I perceive\r\nin it that frankness which I ever found in your character, and which\r\nhonors every character in which it is found. I feel indebted also for\r\nthe justice you do me as to opinions which others, with less candor,\r\nhave imputed to me. I have received many letters stating to me in the\r\nspirit of prophesy, caricatures which the writers, it seems, know are\r\nto be the principles of my administration. To these no answer has been\r\ngiven, because the prejudiced spirit in which they have been written\r\nproved the writers not in a state of mind to yield to truth or reason. To\r\nthe friendly style of your letter I would gladly answer in detail were\r\nit in my power; but I have thought that I ought not to permit myself\r\nto form opinions in detail, until I can have the counsel of those, of\r\nwhose services I wish to avail the public in the administration of their\r\naffairs. Till this can be done, you have justly resorted to the only\r\nproper ground, that of estimating my future by my past conduct. Upwards\r\nof thirty years passed on the stage of public life and under the public\r\neye, may surely enable them to judge whether my future course is likely\r\nto be marked with those departures from reason and moderation, which the\r\npassions of men have been willing to foresee. One imputation in particular\r\nhas been remarked till it seems as if some at least believe it: that I\r\nam an enemy to commerce. They admit me as a friend to agriculture, and\r\nsuppose me an enemy to the only means of disposing of its produce. I might\r\nappeal too to evidences of my attention to the commerce and navigation of\r\nour country in different stations connected with them, but this would lead\r\nto details not to be expected. I have deferred answering your letter till\r\nthis day lest the motives for these explanations should be mistaken. You\r\nwill be so good as to consider this communication so far confidential as\r\nnot to put it in the power of any person committing it to the press. I am\r\nwith great esteem, dear Sir, your most obedient servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO N. R----.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 19, 1801.\r\n\r\nAfter exactly a week's balloting there at length appeared ten States for\r\nme, four for Burr, and two voted blanks. This was done without a single\r\nvote coming over. Morris of Vermont withdrew, so that Lyon's vote became\r\nthat of the State. The four Maryland federalists put in blanks, so then\r\nthe vote of the four Republicans became that of their State. Mr. Hager of\r\nSouth Carolina (who had constantly voted for me) withdrew by agreement,\r\nhis colleagues agreeing in that case to put in blanks. Bayard, the sole\r\nmember of Delaware, voted blank. They had before deliberated whether they\r\nwould come over in a body, when they saw they could not force Burr on\r\nthe republicans, or keep their body entire and unbroken to act in phalanx\r\non such ground of opposition as they shall hereafter be able to conjure\r\nup. Their vote showed what they had decided on, and is considered as a\r\ndeclaration of perpetual war; but their conduct has completely left them\r\nwithout support. Our information from all quarters is that the whole body\r\nof federalists concurred with the republicans in the last elections, and\r\nwith equal anxiety. They had been made to interest themselves so warmly\r\nfor the very choice, which while before the people they opposed, that when\r\nobtained it came as a thing of their own wishes, and they find themselves\r\nembodied with the republicans, and their quondam leaders separated from\r\nthem, and I verily believe they will remain embodied with us, so that\r\nthis conduct of the minority has done in one week what very probably could\r\nhardly have been effected by years of mild and impartial administration.\r\nA letter from Mr. Eppes informs me that Maria is in a situation which\r\ninduces them not to risk a journey to Monticello, so we shall not have the\r\npleasure of meeting them here. I begin to hope I may be able to leave this\r\nplace by the middle of March. My tenderest love to my ever dear Martha,\r\nand kisses to the little ones. Accept yourself sincere and affectionate\r\nsalutation. Adieu.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. SAMUEL DEXTER, SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, Feb. 20, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The liberality of the conversation you honored me with\r\nyesterday evening has given me great satisfaction, and demands my sincere\r\nthanks. It is certain that those of the Cabinet Council of the President\r\nshould be of his bosom confidence. Our geographical position has been an\r\nimpediment to that, while I can with candor declare that the imperfect\r\nopportunities I have had of acquaintance with you, have inspired an entire\r\nesteem for your character, and that you will carry with you that esteem\r\nand sincere wish to be useful to you. The accommodation you have been so\r\nkind as to offer as to the particular date of retiring from office, is\r\nthankfully accepted, and shall be the subject of a particular letter to\r\nyou, as soon as circumstances shall enable me to speak with certainty. In\r\nthe meantime accept assurances of my high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HON. BENJAMIN STODDART, SECRETARY OF THE NAVY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, Feb. 21, 1801.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of the 18th did not get to my hand till yesterday.\r\nI thank you for the accommodation in point of time therein offered.\r\nCircumstances may render it a convenience; in which case I will avail\r\nmyself of it, without too far encroaching on your wishes. At this instant\r\nit is not in my power to say anything certain on the subject of time.\r\nThe declarations of support to the administration of our government\r\nare such as were to be expected from your character and attachment to\r\nour Constitution. I wish support from no quarter longer than my object\r\ncandidly scanned, shall merit it; and especially, not longer than I shall\r\nrigorously adhere to the Constitution. I am with respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHANCELLOR LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, Feb. 24, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It has occurred to me that possibly you might be willing\r\nto undertake the mission as Minister Plenipotentiary to France. If so,\r\nI shall most gladly avail the public of your services in that office.\r\nThough I am sensible of the advantages derived from your talent to your\r\nparticular State, yet I cannot suppress the desire of adding them to the\r\nmass to be employed on the broader scale of the nation at large. I will\r\nask the favor of an immediate answer, that I may give in the nomination to\r\nthe Senate, observing at the same time, that the period of your departure\r\ncan't be settled until we get our administration together, and may perhaps\r\nbe delayed till we receive the ratification of the Senate, which would\r\nprobably be four months; consequently, the commission would not be made\r\nout before then. This will give you ample time to make your departure\r\nconvenient. In hopes of hearing from you as speedily as you can form your\r\nresolution, and hoping it will be favorable, I tender you my respectful\r\nand affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS LOMAX, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, Feb. 25, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 5th came to hand on the 20th, and I have but\r\ntime to acknowledge it under the present pressure of business. I recognize\r\nin it those sentiments of virtue and patriotism which you have ever\r\nmanifested. The suspension of public opinion from the 11th to the 17th,\r\nthe alarm into which it threw all the patriotic part of the federalists,\r\nthe danger of the dissolution of our Union, and unknown consequences\r\nof that, brought over the great body of them to wish with anxiety and\r\nsolicitation for a choice to which they had before been strenuously\r\nopposed. In this state of mind they separated from their congressional\r\nleaders, and came over to us; and the manner in which the last ballot\r\nwas given, has drawn a fixed line of separation between them and their\r\nleaders. When the election took effect, it was as the most desirable\r\nof events to them. This made it a thing of their choice, and finding\r\nthemselves aggregated with us accordingly, they are in a state of mind to\r\nbe consolidated with us, if no intemperate measures on our part revolt\r\nthem again. I am persuaded that weeks of ill-judged conduct here, has\r\nstrengthened us more than years of prudent and conciliatory administration\r\ncould have done. If we can once more get social intercourse restored to\r\nits pristine harmony, I shall believe we have not lived in vain; and that\r\nit may, by rallying them to true republican principles, which few of them\r\nhad thrown off, I sanguinely hope. Accept assurances of the high esteem\r\nand respect of, dear Sir, your friend and servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE.\r\n\r\nTo give the usual opportunity of appointing a President _pro tempore_,\r\nI now propose to retire from the chair of the Senate; and, as the time\r\nis near at hand when the relations will cease which have for some time\r\nsubsisted between this honorable house and myself, I beg leave before\r\nI withdraw, to return them my grateful thanks for all the instances of\r\nattention and respect with which they have been pleased to honor me. In\r\nthe discharge of my functions here, it has been my conscientious endeavor\r\nto observe impartial justice, without regard to persons or subjects, and\r\nif I have failed in impressing this on the mind of the Senate, it will be\r\nto me a circumstance of the deepest regret. I may have erred at times--no\r\ndoubt I have erred; this is the law of human nature. For honest errors,\r\nhowever, indulgence may be hoped. I owe to truth and justice at the same\r\ntime to declare that the habits of order and decorum, which so strongly\r\ncharacterize the proceedings of the Senate, have rendered the umpirage\r\nof their President an office of little difficulty, that in times and on\r\nquestions which have severely tried the sensibilities of the house, calm\r\nand temperate discussion has rarely been disturbed by departures from\r\norder.\r\n\r\nShould the support which I have received from the Senate, in the\r\nperformance of my duties here, attend me into the new station to which the\r\npublic will has transferred me, I shall consider it as commencing under\r\nthe happiest auspices.\r\n\r\nWith these expressions of my dutiful regard to the Senate, as a body, I\r\nask leave to mingle my particular wishes for the health and happiness\r\nof the individuals who compose it, and to tender them my cordial and\r\nrespectful adieus.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE LA FAYETTE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 1, 1801.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--I received a letter from you the last year, and it\r\nhas been long since I wrote one to you. During the earlier part of the\r\nperiod it would never have got to your hands, and during the latter,\r\nsuch has been the state of politics on both sides of the water, that no\r\ncommunications were safe. Nevertheless, I have never ceased to cherish\r\na sincere friendship for you, and to take a lively interest in your\r\nsufferings and losses. It would make me happy to learn that they are to\r\nhave an end. We have passed through an awful scene in this country. The\r\nconvulsion of Europe shook even us to our centre. A few hardy spirits\r\nstood firm to their post, and the ship has breasted the storm. The details\r\nof this cannot be put on paper. For the astonishing particulars I refer\r\nyou to the bearer of this, Mr. Dorson, my friend, fully possessed of\r\neverything, as being a Member of Congress, and worthy of confidence. From\r\nhim you must learn what America is now, or was, and what it has been;\r\nfor now I hope it is getting back to the state in which you knew it. I\r\nwill only add that the storm we have passed through proves our vessel\r\nindestructible. I have heard with great concern of the delicacy of Mrs. de\r\nLa Fayette's health, and with anxiety to learn that it is getting better.\r\nHaving been at Monticello all the time your son was in America, I had not\r\nan opportunity of seeing him and of proving my friendship to one in whom I\r\nhave an interest. Present the homage of my respects and attachment to Mrs.\r\nLa Fayette, and accept yourself assurances of my constant and affectionate\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\nP. S. _March 18._ This moment Mr. Pickon arrived, and delivered me your\r\nletter, of which he was the bearer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE PRESIDENT PRO TEMPORE OF THE SENATE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 2, 1801.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I beg leave through you to inform the Honorable the Senate of the\r\nUnited States, that I propose to take the oath which the Constitution\r\nprescribes to the President of the United States, before he enters on the\r\nexecution of his office, on Wednesday, the 4th inst., at twelve o'clock,\r\nin the Senate chamber.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE HONORABLE JOHN MARSHALL.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 2, 1801.\r\n\r\nI was desired two or three days ago to sign some sea letters, to be\r\ndated on or after the 4th of March, but in the meantime to be forwarded\r\nto the different ports; and I understood you would countersign them as\r\nthe person appointed to perform the duties of Secretary of State, but\r\nthat you thought a re-appointment, to be dated the 4th of March, would\r\nbe necessary. I shall with pleasure sign such a re-appointment _nunc pro\r\ntunc_, if you can direct it to be made out, not being able to do it myself\r\nfor want of a knowledge of the form.\r\n\r\nI propose to take the oath or oaths of office as President of the United\r\nStates, on Wednesday the 4th inst., at 12 o'clock, in the Senate chamber.\r\nMay I hope the favor of your attendance to administer the oath? As the\r\ntwo Houses have notice of the hour, I presume a precise punctuality to it\r\nwill be expected from me. I would pray you in the meantime to consider\r\nwhether the oath prescribed in the Constitution be not the only one\r\nnecessary to take? It seems to comprehend the substance of that prescribed\r\nby the Act of Congress to all officers, and it may be questionable\r\nwhether the Legislature can require any new oath from the President. I do\r\nnot know what has been done in this heretofore; but I presume the oaths\r\nadministered to my predecessors are recorded in the Secretary of State's\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nNot being yet provided with a private secretary, and needing some person\r\non Wednesday to be the bearer of a message or messages to the Senate, I\r\npresume the chief clerk of the department of State might be employed with\r\npropriety. Permit me through you to ask the favor of his attendance on me\r\nto my lodgings on Wednesday, after I shall have been qualified.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be with great respect, Sir, your most obedient, humble\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 3, 1801.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I beg leave through you to inform the Honorable the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States, that I shall take the oath which\r\nthe Constitution prescribes to the President of the United States, before\r\nhe enters on the execution of his office, on Wednesday, the 4th inst., at\r\ntwelve o'clock, in the Senate chamber.\r\n\r\nI have the honor to be, with the greatest respect, Sir, your most\r\nobedient, and most humble servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN DICKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 6, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--No pleasure can exceed that which I received from reading your\r\nletter of the 21st ultimo. It was like the joy we expect in the mansions\r\nof the blessed, when received with the embraces of our forefathers,\r\nwe shall be welcomed with their blessing as having done our part not\r\nunworthily of them. The storm through which we have passed, has been\r\ntremendous indeed. The tough sides of our Argosie have been thoroughly\r\ntried. Her strength has stood the waves into which she was steered, with\r\na view to sink her. We shall put her on her republican tack, and she\r\nwill now show by the beauty of her motion the skill of her builders.\r\nFigure apart, our fellow citizens have been led hood-winked from their\r\nprinciples, by a most extraordinary combination of circumstances. But\r\nthe band is removed, and they now see for themselves. I hope to see\r\nshortly a perfect consolidation, to effect which, nothing shall be\r\nspared on my part, short of the abandonment of the principles of our\r\nrevolution. A just and solid republican government maintained here, will\r\nbe a standing monument and example for the aim and imitation of the\r\npeople of other countries; and I join with you in the hope and belief\r\nthat they will see, from our example, that a free government is of\r\nall others the most energetic; that the inquiry which has been excited\r\namong the mass of mankind by our revolution and its consequences, will\r\nameliorate the condition of man over a great portion of the globe. What a\r\nsatisfaction have we in the contemplation of the benevolent effects of our\r\nefforts, compared with those of the leaders on the other side, who have\r\ndiscountenanced all advances in science as dangerous innovations, have\r\nendeavored to render philosophy and republicanism terms of reproach, to\r\npersuade us that man cannot be governed but by the rod, &c. I shall have\r\nthe happiness of living and dying in the contrary hope. Accept assurances\r\nof my constant and sincere respect and attachment, and my affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 7, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had written the enclosed letter to Mrs. Trist, and was\r\njust proceeding to begin one to you, when your favor of the 6th was put\r\ninto my hands. I thank you sincerely for it, and consider the views of\r\nit so sound, that I have communicated it to my coadjutors as one of our\r\nimportant evidences of the public sentiment, according to which we must\r\nshape our course. I suspect, partly from this, but more from a letter\r\nof J. Taylor's which has been put into my hands, that an incorrect idea\r\nof my views has got abroad. I am in hopes my inaugural address will in\r\nsome measure set this to rights, as it will present the leading objects\r\nto be conciliation and adherence to sound principle. This I know is\r\nimpracticable with the leaders of the late faction, whom I abandon as\r\nincurables, and will never turn an inch out of my way to reconcile them.\r\nBut with the main body of the federalists, I believe it very practicable.\r\nYou know that the manœuvres of the year X. Y. Z. carried over from us a\r\ngreat body of the people, real republicans, and honest men under virtuous\r\nmotives. The delusion lasted a while. At length the poor arts of tub\r\nplots, &c. were repeated till the designs of the party became suspected.\r\nFrom that moment those who had left us began to come back. It was by their\r\nreturn to us that we gained the victory in November, 1800, which we should\r\nnot have gained in November, 1799. But during the suspension of the public\r\nmind from the 11th to the 17th of February, and the anxiety and alarm\r\nlest there should be no election, and anarchy ensue, a wonderful effect\r\nwas produced on the mass of federalists who had not before come over.\r\nThose who had before become sensible of their error in the former change,\r\nand only wanted a decent excuse for coming back, seized that occasion\r\nfor doing so. Another body, and a large one it is, who from timidity of\r\nconstitution had gone with those who wished for a strong executive, were\r\ninduced by the same timidity to come over to us rather than risk anarchy:\r\nso that, according to the evidence we receive from every direction, we\r\nmay say that the whole of that portion of the people which were called\r\nfederalists, were made to desire anxiously the very event they had just\r\nbefore opposed with all their energies, and to receive the election which\r\nwas made, as an object of their earnest wishes, a child of their own.\r\nThese people (I always exclude their leaders) are now aggregated with\r\nus, they look with a certain degree of affection and confidence to the\r\nadministration, ready to become attached to it, if it avoids in the outset\r\nacts which might revolt and throw them off. To give time for a perfect\r\nconsolidation seems prudent. I have firmly refused to follow the counsels\r\nof those who have desired the giving offices to some of their leaders, in\r\norder to reconcile. I have given, and will give only to republicans, under\r\nexisting circumstances. But I believe with others, that deprivations of\r\noffice, if made on the ground of political principles alone, would revolt\r\nour new converts, and give a body to leaders who now stand alone. Some,\r\nI know, must be made. They must be as few as possible, done gradually,\r\nand bottomed on some malversation or inherent disqualification. Where we\r\nshall draw the line between retaining all and none, is not yet settled,\r\nand will not be till we get our administration together; and perhaps even\r\nthen, we shall proceed _à talons_, balancing our measures according to the\r\nimpression we perceive them to make.\r\n\r\nThis may give you a general view of our plan. Should you be in Albemarle\r\nthe first week in April, I shall have the pleasure of seeing you there,\r\nand of developing things more particularly, and of profiting by an\r\nintercommunication of views. Dawson sails for France about the 15th, as\r\nthe _bearer_ only of the treaty to Elsworth and Murray. He has probably\r\nasked your commands, and your introductory letters.\r\n\r\nPresent my respects to Mrs. Monroe, and accept assurances of my high and\r\naffectionate consideration and attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR M'KEAN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 9, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of February\r\nthe 20th, and to thank you for your congratulations on the event of the\r\nelection. Had it terminated in the elevation of Mr. Burr, every republican\r\nwould, I am sure, have acquiesced in a moment; because, however it might\r\nhave been variant from the intentions of the voters, yet it would have\r\nbeen agreeable to the Constitution. No man would more cheerfully have\r\nsubmitted than myself, because I am sure the administration would have\r\nbeen republican, and the chair of the Senate permitting me to be at home\r\neight months in the year, would, on that account, have been much more\r\nconsonant to my real satisfaction. But in the event of an usurpation, I\r\nwas decidedly with those who were determined not to permit it. Because\r\nthat precedent once set, would be artificially reproduced, and end soon\r\nin a dictator. Virginia was bristling up I believe. I shall know the\r\nparticulars from Governor Monroe, whom I expect to meet in a short visit\r\nI must make home, to select some books, &c. necessary here, and make other\r\ndomestic arrangements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high esteem and regard.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOEL BARLOW.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 14, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Not having my papers here, it is not in my power to acknowledge\r\nthe receipt of your letters by their dates, but I am pretty certain I\r\nhave received two in the course of the last twelve months, one of them\r\ncovering your excellent second letter. Nothing can be sounder than the\r\nprinciples it inculcates, and I am not without hopes they will make their\r\nway. You have understood that the revolutionary movements in Europe had,\r\nby industry and artifice, been wrought into objects of terror even to\r\nthis country, and had really involved a great portion of our well-meaning\r\ncitizens in a panic which was perfectly unaccountable, and during the\r\nprevalence of which they were led to support measures the most insane.\r\nThey are now pretty thoroughly recovered from it, and sensible of the\r\nmischief which was done, and preparing to be done, had their minds\r\ncontinued a little longer under that derangement. The recovery bids fair\r\nto be complete, and to obliterate entirely the line of party division\r\nwhich had been so strongly drawn. Not that their late leaders have come\r\nover, or ever can come over. But they stand, at present, almost without\r\nfollowers. The principal of them have retreated into the judiciary as a\r\nstrong hold, the tenure of which renders it difficult to dislodge them.\r\nFor all the particulars I must refer you to Mr. Dawson, a member of\r\nCongress, fully informed and worthy of entire confidence. Give me leave to\r\nask for him your attentions and civilities, and a verbal communication of\r\nsuch things on your side the water as you know I feel a great interest in,\r\nand as may not with safety be committed to paper. I am entirely unable to\r\nconjecture the issue of things with you.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant esteem and high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 18, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters of October the 1st, 4th, 6th and 16th, came\r\nduly to hand, and the papers which they covered were, according to your\r\npermission, published in the newspapers and in a pamphlet, and under\r\nyour own name. These papers contain precisely our principles, and I hope\r\nthey will be generally recognized here. Determined as we are to avoid,\r\nif possible, wasting the energies of our people in war and destruction,\r\nwe shall avoid implicating ourselves with the powers of Europe, even\r\nin support of principles which we mean to pursue. They have so many\r\nother interests different from ours, that we must avoid being entangled\r\nin them. We believe we can enforce those principles, as to ourselves,\r\nby peaceable means, now that we are likely to have our public councils\r\ndetached from foreign views. The return of our citizens from the phrenzy\r\ninto which they had been wrought, partly by ill conduct in France, partly\r\nby artifices practised on them, is almost entire, and will, I believe,\r\nbecome quite so. But these details, too minute and long for a letter, will\r\nbe better developed by Mr. Dawson, the bearer of this, a member of the\r\nlate Congress, to whom I refer you for them. He goes in the Maryland, a\r\nsloop of war, which will wait a few days at Havre to receive his letters,\r\nto be written on his arrival at Paris. You expressed a wish to get a\r\npassage to this country in a public vessel. Mr. Dawson is charged with\r\norders to the captain of the Maryland to receive and accommodate you\r\nwith a passage back, if you can be ready to depart at such short warning.\r\nRobert R. Livingston is appointed Minister Plenipotentiary to the republic\r\nof France, but will not leave this till we receive the ratification of\r\nthe convention by Mr. Dawson. I am in hopes you will find us returned\r\ngenerally to sentiments worthy of former times. In these it will be your\r\nglory to have steadily labored, and with as much effect as any man living.\r\nThat you may long live to continue your useful labors, and to reap their\r\nreward in the thankfulness of nations, is my sincere prayer.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high esteem and affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DE REYNEVAL.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 20, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Pichon, who arrived two days ago, delivered me your favor\r\nof January the 1st, and I had before received one by Mr. Dupont, dated\r\nAugust the 24th, 1799, both on the subject of lands, claimed on behalf\r\nof your brother, Mr. Girard, and that of August the 24th, containing a\r\nstatement of the case. I had verbally explained to Mr. Dupont, at the\r\ntime, what I presumed to have been the case, which must, I believe, be\r\nvery much mistaken in the statement sent with that letter; and I expected\r\nhe had communicated it to you.\r\n\r\nDuring the regal government, two companies, called the Loyal and the Ohio\r\ncompanies, had obtained grants from the crown for eight hundred thousand,\r\nor one million of acres of land, each, on the Ohio, on condition of\r\nsettling them in a given number of years. They surveyed some, and settled\r\nthem; but the war of 1755 came on, and broke up the settlements. After it\r\nwas over, they petitioned for a renewal. Four other large companies then\r\nformed themselves, called the Mississippi, the Illinois, the Wabash, and\r\nthe Indiana companies, each praying for immense quantities of land, some\r\namounting to two hundred miles square; so that they proposed to cover\r\nthe whole country north between the Ohio and Mississippi, and a great\r\nportion of what is south. All these petitions were depending, without any\r\nanswer whatever from the crown, when the Revolutionary war broke out. The\r\npetitioners had associated to themselves some of the nobility of England,\r\nand most of the characters in America of great influence. When Congress\r\nassumed the government, they took some of their body in as partners, to\r\nobtain their influence; and I remember to have heard, at the time, that\r\none of them took Mr. Girard as a partner, expecting by that to obtain\r\nthe influence of the French court, to obtain grants of those lands which\r\nthey had not been able to obtain from the British government. All these\r\nlands were within the limits of Virginia, and that State determined,\r\nperemptorily, that they never should be granted to large companies, but\r\nleft open equally to all; and when they passed their land law, (which I\r\nthink was in 1778,) they confirmed only so much of the lands of the Loyal\r\ncompany as they had actually surveyed, which was a very small proportion,\r\nand annulled every other pretension. And when that State conveyed the\r\nlands to Congress, (which was not till 1784,) so determined were they\r\nto prevent their being granted to these or any other large companies,\r\nthat they made it an express condition of the cession, that they should\r\nbe applied first towards the soldiers' bounties, and the residue sold\r\nfor the payment of the national debt, and for no other purpose. This\r\ndisposition has been, accordingly, rigorously made, and is still going on;\r\nand Congress considers itself as having no authority to dispose of them\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI sincerely wish, Sir, it had been in my power to have given you a more\r\nagreeable account of this claim. But as the case actually is, the most\r\nsubstantial service is to state it exactly, and not to foster false\r\nexpectations. I remember with great sensibility all the attentions you\r\nwere so good as to render me while I resided in Paris, and shall be made\r\nhappy by every occasion which can be given me of acknowledging them; and\r\nthe expressions of your friendly recollection are particularly soothing to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nAccept, I pray you, the assurances of my high consideration and constant\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR JOSEPH PRIESTLEY.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 21, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I learned some time ago that you were in Philadelphia, but that\r\nit was only for a fortnight; and I supposed you were gone. It was not till\r\nyesterday I received information that you were still there, had been very\r\nill, but were on the recovery. I sincerely rejoice that you are so. Yours\r\nis one of the few lives precious to mankind, and for the continuance of\r\nwhich every thinking man is solicitous. Bigots may be an exception. What\r\nan effort, my dear Sir, of bigotry in politics and religion have we gone\r\nthrough! The barbarians really flattered themselves they should be able to\r\nbring back the times of Vandalism, when ignorance put everything into the\r\nhands of power and priestcraft. All advances in science were proscribed\r\nas innovations. They pretended to praise and encourage education, but\r\nit was to be the education of our ancestors. We were to look backwards,\r\nnot forwards, for improvement; the President himself declaring, in one\r\nof his answers to addresses, that we were never to expect to go beyond\r\nthem in real science. This was the real ground of all the attacks on\r\nyou. Those who live by mystery and _charlatanerie_, fearing you would\r\nrender them useless by simplifying the Christian philosophy,--the most\r\nsublime and benevolent, but most perverted system that ever shone on\r\nman,--endeavored to crush your well-earned and well-deserved fame. But\r\nit was the Lilliputians upon Gulliver. Our countrymen have recovered from\r\nthe alarm into which art and industry had thrown them; science and honesty\r\nare replaced on their high ground; and you, my dear Sir, as their great\r\napostle, are on its pinnacle. It is with heartfelt satisfaction that, in\r\nthe first moments of my public action, I can hail you with welcome to our\r\nland, tender to you the homage of its respect and esteem, cover you under\r\nthe protection of those laws which were made for the wise and good like\r\nyou, and disdain the legitimacy of that libel on legislation, which, under\r\nthe form of a law, was for some time placed among them.[14]\r\n\r\nAs the storm is now subsiding, and the horizon becoming serene, it is\r\npleasant to consider the phenomenon with attention. We can no longer\r\nsay there is nothing new under the sun. For this whole chapter in the\r\nhistory of man is new. The great extent of our Republic is new. Its sparse\r\nhabitation is new. The mighty wave of public opinion which has rolled over\r\nit is new. But the most pleasing novelty is, its so quietly subsiding\r\nover such an extent of surface to its true level again. The order and\r\ngood sense displayed in this recovery from delusion, and in the momentous\r\ncrisis which lately arose, really bespeak a strength of character in our\r\nnation which augurs well for the duration of our Republic; and I am much\r\nbetter satisfied now of its stability than I was before it was tried. I\r\nhave been, above all things, solaced by the prospect which opened on us,\r\nin the event of a non-election of a President; in which case, the federal\r\ngovernment would have been in the situation of a clock or watch run down.\r\nThere was no idea of force, nor of any occasion for it. A convention,\r\ninvited by the republican members of Congress, with the virtual President\r\nand Vice President, would have been on the ground in eight weeks, would\r\nhave repaired the Constitution where it was defective, and wound it up\r\nagain. This peaceable and legitimate resource, to which we are in the\r\nhabit of implicit obedience, superseding all appeal to force, and being\r\nalways within our reach, shows a precious principle of self-preservation\r\nin our composition, till a change of circumstances shall take place, which\r\nis not within prospect at any definite period.\r\n\r\nBut I have got into a long disquisition on politics, when I only meant\r\nto express my sympathy in the state of your health, and to tender you all\r\nthe affections of public and private hospitality. I should be very happy\r\nindeed to see you here. I leave this about the 30th instant, to return\r\nabout the 25th of April. If you do not leave Philadelphia before that, a\r\nlittle excursion hither would help your health. I should be much gratified\r\nwith the possession of a guest I so much esteem, and should claim a right\r\nto lodge you, should you make such an excursion.\r\n\r\nAccept the homage of my high consideration and respect, and assurances of\r\naffectionate attachment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [14] [In the margin is written by the author, \"Alien law.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL WARREN.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 21, 1801.\r\n\r\nI am much gratified by the receipt of your favor of the 4th instant, and\r\nby the expressions of friendly sentiment it contains. It is pleasant for\r\nthose who have just escaped threatened shipwreck, to hail one another when\r\nlanded in unexpected safety. The resistance which our republic has opposed\r\nto a course of operation, for which it was not destined, shows a strength\r\nof body which affords the most flattering presage of duration. I hope we\r\nshall now be permitted to steer her in her natural course, and to show\r\nby the smoothness of her motion the skill with which she has been formed\r\nfor it. I have seen with great grief yourself and so many other venerable\r\npatriots, retired and weeping in silence over the rapid subversion of\r\nthose principles for the attachment of which you had sacrificed the\r\nease and comforts of life; but I rejoice that you have lived to see\r\nus revindicate our rights, and regain manfully the ground from which\r\nfraud, not force, had for a moment driven us. The character which our\r\nfellow-citizens have displayed on this occasion, gives us everything\r\nto hope for the permanence of our government. Its extent has saved us.\r\nWhile some parts were laboring under the paroxysm of delusion, others\r\nretained their senses, and time was thus given to the affected parts to\r\nrecover their health. Your portion of the Union is longest recovering,\r\nbecause the deceivers there wear a more imposing form; but a little more\r\ntime, and they too will recover. I pray you to present the homage of my\r\ngreat respect to Mrs. Warren. I have long possessed evidences of her high\r\nstation in the ranks of genius; and have considered her silence as a proof\r\nthat she did not go with the current. Accept yourself, assurances of my\r\nhigh consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO NATHANIEL NILES, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 22, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of February 12th, which did not get to my hands till\r\nMarch 2d, is entitled to my acknowledgments. It was the more agreeable as\r\nit proved that the esteem I had entertained for you while we were acting\r\ntogether on the public stage, had not been without reciprocated effect.\r\nWhat wonderful scenes have passed since that time! The late chapter\r\nof our history furnishes a lesson to man perfectly new. The times have\r\nbeen awful, but they have proved an useful truth, that the good citizen\r\nmust never despair of the commonwealth. How many good men abandoned the\r\ndeck, and gave up the vessel as lost. It furnishes a new proof of the\r\nfalsehood of Montesquieu's doctrine, that a republic can be preserved\r\nonly in a small territory. The reverse is the truth. Had our territory\r\nbeen even a third only of what it is, we were gone. But while frenzy and\r\ndelusion like an epidemic, gained certain parts, the residue remained\r\nsound and untouched, and held on till their brethren could recover from\r\nthe temporary delusion; and that circumstance has given me great comfort.\r\nThere was general alarm during the pending of the election in Congress,\r\nlest no President should be chosen, the government be dissolved and\r\nanarchy ensue. But the cool determination of the really patriotic to call\r\na convention in that case, which might be on the ground in eight weeks,\r\nand wind up the machine again which had only run down, pointed out to my\r\nmind a perpetual and peaceable resource against * * * * * in whatever\r\nextremity might befall us; and I am certain a convention would have\r\ncommanded immediate and universal obedience. How happy that our army had\r\nbeen disbanded! What might have happened otherwise seems rather a subject\r\nof reflection than explanation. You have seen your recommendation of Mr.\r\nWillard duly respected. As to yourself, I hope we shall see you again in\r\nCongress. Accept assurances of my high respect and attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 22, 1801.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRIEND,--Yours of February 1st did not reach me till February\r\n28th, and a pressing business has retarded my acknowledging it. I\r\nsincerely thank you for your congratulations on my election; but this\r\nis only the first verse of the chapter. What the last may be nobody\r\ncan tell. A consciousness that I feel no desire but to do what is best,\r\nwithout passion or predilection, encourages me to hope for an indulgent\r\nconstruction of what I do. I had in General Washington's time proposed\r\nyou as director of the mint, and therefore should the more readily have\r\nturned to you, had a vacancy now happened; but that institution continuing\r\nat Philadelphia, because the Legislature have not taken up the subject\r\nin time to decide on it, it will of course remain there until this time\r\ntwelvemonths. Should it then be removed, the present Director would\r\nprobably, and the Treasurer certainly resign. It would give me great\r\npleasure to employ the talents and integrity of Dr. Foster, in the latter\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nI am very much in hopes we shall be able to restore union to our country.\r\nNot indeed that the federal leaders can be brought over. They are\r\ninvincibles; but I really hope their followers may. The bulk of these\r\nlast were real republicans, carried over from us by French excesses. This\r\ninduced me to offer a political creed, and to invite to conciliation\r\nfirst; and I am pleased to hear, that these principles are recognized\r\nby them, and considered as no bar of separation. A moderate conduct\r\nthroughout, which may not revolt our new friends, and which may give them\r\ntenets with us, must be observed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresent my respects to Mrs. Page, and accept evidences of my constant and\r\naffectionate esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN WARING, ESQ., AND OTHERS.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 23, 1801.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--The reliance is most flattering to me which you are pleased\r\nto express in the character of my public conduct, as is the expectation\r\nwith which you look forward to the inviolable preservation of our national\r\nConstitution, deservedly the boast of our country. That peace, safety,\r\nand concord may be the portion of our native land, and be long enjoyed\r\nby our fellow-citizens, is the most ardent wish of my heart, and if I can\r\nbe instrumental in procuring or preserving them, I shall think I have not\r\nlived in vain. In every country where man is free to think and to speak,\r\ndifferences of opinion will arise from difference of perception, and the\r\nimperfection of reason; but these differences, when permitted, as in this\r\nhappy country, to purify themselves by free discussion, are but as passing\r\nclouds overspreading our land transiently, and leaving our horizon more\r\nbright and serene. That love of order and obedience to the laws, which\r\nso remarkably characterize the citizens of the United States, are sure\r\npledges of internal tranquillity; and the elective franchise, if guarded\r\nas the act of our safety, will peaceably dissipate all combinations to\r\nsubvert a Constitution dictated by the wisdom, and resting on the will of\r\nthe people. That will is the only legitimate foundation of any government,\r\nand to protect its free expression should be our first object. I offer\r\nmy sincere prayers to the Supreme ruler of the Universe, that he may\r\nlong preserve our country in freedom and prosperity, and to yourselves,\r\nGentlemen, and the citizens of Columbia and its vicinity, the assurances\r\nof my profound consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MOSES ROBINSON.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 23, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the 3d\r\ninstant, and to thank you for the friendly expressions it contains. I\r\nentertain real hope that the whole body of your fellow citizens (many\r\nof whom had been carried away by the X. Y. Z. business) will shortly\r\nbe consolidated in the same sentiments. When they examine the real\r\nprinciples of both parties, I think they will find little to differ\r\nabout. I know, indeed, that there are some of their leaders who have\r\nso committed themselves, that pride, if no other passion, will prevent\r\ntheir coalescing. We must be easy with them. The eastern States will\r\nbe the last to come over, on account of the dominion of the clergy, who\r\nhad got a smell of union between Church and State, and began to indulge\r\nreveries which can never be realized in the present state of science. If,\r\nindeed, they could have prevailed on us to view all advances in science as\r\ndangerous innovations, and to look back to the opinions and practices of\r\nour forefathers, instead of looking forward, for improvement, a promising\r\ngroundwork would have been laid. But I am in hopes their good sense will\r\ndictate to them, that since the mountain will not come to them, they\r\nhad better go to the mountain; that they will find their interest in\r\nacquiescing in the liberty and science of their country, and that the\r\nChristian religion, when divested of the rags in which they have enveloped\r\nit, and brought to the original purity and simplicity of its benevolent\r\ninstitutor, is a religion of all others most friendly to liberty, science,\r\nand the freest expansion of the human mind.\r\n\r\nI sincerely wish with you, we could see our government so secured as to\r\ndepend less on the character of the person in whose hands it is trusted.\r\nBad men will sometimes get in, and with such an immense patronage, may\r\nmake great progress in corrupting the public mind and principles. This is\r\na subject with which wisdom and patriotism should be occupied.\r\n\r\nI pray you to accept assurances of my high respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM B. GILES.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 23, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received two days ago your favor of the 16th, and thank\r\nyou for your kind felicitations on my election; but whether it will be a\r\nsubject of felicitation, permanently, will be for the chapters of future\r\nhistory to say. The important subjects of the government I meet with some\r\ndegree of courage and confidence, because I do believe the talents to be\r\nassociated with me, the honest line of conduct we will religiously pursue\r\nat home and abroad, and the confidence of my fellow citizens dawning on\r\nus, will be equal to these objects.\r\n\r\nBut there is another branch of duty which I must meet with courage\r\ntoo, though I cannot without pain; that is, the appointments and\r\ndisappointments as to offices. Madison and Gallatin being still absent,\r\nwe have not yet decided on our rules of conduct as to these. That some\r\nought to be removed from office, and that all ought not, all mankind\r\nwill agree. But where to draw the line, perhaps no two will agree.\r\nConsequently, nothing like a general approbation on this subject can be\r\nlooked for. Some principles have been the subject of conversation, but\r\nnot of determination; _e. g._ 1, all appointments to _civil_ offices\r\n_during pleasure_, made after the event of the election was certainly\r\nknown to Mr. Adams, are considered as nullities. I do not view the persons\r\nappointed as even candidates for the office, but make others without\r\nnoticing or notifying them. Mr. Adams' best friends have agreed this is\r\nright. 2. Officers who have been guilty of _official_ mal-conduct are\r\nproper subjects of removal. 3. Good men, to whom there is no objection\r\nbut a difference of political principle, practised on only as far as\r\nthe right of a private citizen will justify, are not proper subjects of\r\nremoval, except in the case of attorneys and marshals. The courts being\r\nso decidedly federal and irremovable, it is believed that republican\r\nattorneys and marshals, being the doors of entrance into the courts, are\r\nindispensably necessary as a shield to the republican part of our fellow\r\ncitizens, which, I believe, is the main body of the people.\r\n\r\nThese principles are yet to be considered of, and I sketch them to you in\r\nconfidence. Not that there is objection to your mooting them as subjects\r\nof conversation, and as proceeding from yourself, but not as matters\r\nof executive determination. Nay, farther, I will thank you for your own\r\nsentiments and those of others on them. If received before the 20th of\r\nApril, they will be in time for our deliberation on the subject. You know\r\nthat it was in the year X. Y. Z. that so great a transition from us to the\r\nother side took place, and with as real republicans as we were ourselves;\r\nthat these, after getting over that delusion, have been returning to us,\r\nand that it is to that return we owe a triumph in 1800, which in 1799\r\nwould have been the other way. The week's suspension of the election\r\nbefore Congress, seems almost to have completed that business, and to have\r\nbrought over nearly the whole remaining mass. They now find themselves\r\nwith us, and separated from their quondam leaders. If we can but avoid\r\nshocking their feelings by unnecessary acts of severity against their late\r\nfriends, they will in a little time cement and form one mass with us, and\r\nby these means harmony and union be restored to our country, which would\r\nbe the greatest good we could effect. It was a conviction that these\r\npeople did not differ from us in principle, which induced me to define\r\nthe principles which I deemed orthodox, and to urge a reunion on those\r\nprinciples; and I am induced to hope it has conciliated many. I do not\r\nspeak of the desperadoes of the quondam faction in and out of Congress.\r\nThese I consider as incurables, on whom all attentions would be lost, and\r\ntherefore will not be wasted. But my wish is, to keep their flock from\r\nreturning to them.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of the marshal of Virginia, I refer you confidentially to\r\nMajor Egglestone for information. I leave this about this day se'nnight,\r\nto make some arrangements at home preparatory to my final removal to this\r\nplace, from which I shall be absent about three weeks.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant esteem and high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 24, 1801\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your friendly favor of the\r\n12th, and the pleasing sensations produced in my mind by its affectionate\r\ncontents. I am made very happy by learning that the sentiments expressed\r\nin my inaugural address gave general satisfaction, and holds out a ground\r\non which our fellow citizens can once more unite. I am the more pleased,\r\nbecause these sentiments have been long and radically mine, and therefore\r\nwill be pursued honestly and conscientiously. I know there is an obstacle\r\nwhich very possibly may check the confidence which would otherwise\r\nhave been more generally reposed in my observance of these principles.\r\nThis obstacle does not arise from the measures to be pursued, as to\r\nwhich I am in no fear of giving satisfaction, but from appointments and\r\ndisappointments as to office. With regard to appointments, I have so much\r\nconfidence in the justice and good sense of the federalists, that I have\r\nno doubt they will concur in the fairness of the position, that after they\r\nhave been in the exclusive possession of all offices from the very first\r\norigin of party among us, to the 3d of March, at 9 o'clock in the night,\r\nno republican ever admitted, and this doctrine newly avowed, it is now\r\nperfectly just that the republicans should come in for the vacancies which\r\nmay fall in, until something like an equilibrium in office be restored.\r\nBut the great stumbling block will be removals, which though made on\r\nthose just principles only on which my predecessor ought to have removed\r\nthe same persons, will nevertheless be ascribed to removal on party\r\nprinciples. 1st. I will expunge the effects of Mr. A.'s indecent conduct,\r\nin crowding nominations after he knew they were not for himself, till 9\r\no'clock of the night, at 12 o'clock of which he was to go out of office.\r\nSo far as they are during pleasure, I shall not consider the persons\r\nnamed, even as candidates for the office, nor pay the respect of notifying\r\nthem that I consider what was done as a nullity. 2d. Some removals must\r\nbe made for misconduct. One of these is of the marshal in your city,\r\nwho being an officer of justice, intrusted with the function of choosing\r\nimpartial judges for the trial of his fellow citizens, placed at the awful\r\ntribunal of God and their country, selected judges who either avowed, or\r\nwere known to him to be predetermined to condemn; and if the lives of the\r\nunfortunate persons were not cut short by the sword of the law, it was not\r\nfor want of _his_ good-will. In another State I have to perform the same\r\nact of justice on the dearest connection of my dearest friend, for similar\r\nconduct, in a case not capital. The same practice of packing juries, and\r\nprosecuting their fellow citizens with the bitterness of party hatred,\r\nwill probably involve several other marshals and attorneys. Out of this\r\nline I see but very few instances where past misconduct has been in a\r\ndegree to call for notice. Of the thousands of officers therefore, in the\r\nUnited States, a very few individuals only, probably not twenty, will be\r\nremoved; and these only for doing what they ought not to have done. Two\r\nor three instances indeed where Mr. A. removed men because they would not\r\nsign addresses, &c., to him, will be rectified--the persons restored. The\r\nwhole world will say this is just. I know that in stopping thus short in\r\nthe career of removal, I shall give great offence to many of my friends.\r\nThat torrent has been pressing me heavily, and will require all my force\r\nto bear up against; but my maxim is \"_fiat justitia, ruat cælum._\" After\r\nthe first unfavorable impressions of doing too much in the opinion of\r\nsome, and too little in that of others, shall be got over, I should\r\nhope a steady line of conciliation very practicable, and that without\r\nyielding a single republican principle. A certainty that these principles\r\nprevailed in the breasts of the main body of federalists, was my motive\r\nfor stating them as the ground of reunion. I have said thus much for your\r\nprivate satisfaction, to be used even in private conversation, as the\r\npresumptive principles on which we shall act, but not as proceeding from\r\nmyself declaredly. Information lately received from France gives a high\r\nidea of the progress of science there; it seems to keep pace with their\r\n* * * * *. I have[15] just received from the A. P. Society, two volumes of\r\nComparative Anatomy, by Cuvier, probably the greatest work in that line\r\nthat has ever appeared. His comparisons embrace every organ of the animal\r\ncarcass; and from man to the * * * * *. Accept assurances of my sincere\r\nfriendship, and high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DON JOSEPH YZNARDI.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 26, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The Secretary of State is proceeding in the consideration\r\nof the several matters which have been proposed to us by you, and will\r\nprepare answers to them, and particularly as to our vessels taken by\r\nFrench cruisers, and carried into the ports of Spain, contrary, as we\r\nsuppose, to the tenor of the convention with France. Though ordinary\r\nbusiness will be regularly transacted with you by the Secretary of State,\r\nyet considering what you mentioned as to our minister at Madrid to have\r\nbeen private and confidential, I take it out of the official course, and\r\nobserve to you myself that under an intimate conviction of long standing\r\nin my mind, of the importance of an honest friendship with Spain, and\r\none which shall identify her American interests with our own, I see in a\r\nstrong point of view the necessity that the organ of communication which\r\nwe establish near the King should possess the favor and confidence of\r\nthat government. I have therefore destined for that mission a person whose\r\naccommodating and reasonable conduct, which will be still more fortified\r\nby instructions, will render him agreeable there, and an useful channel\r\nof communication between us. I have no doubt the new appointment by that\r\ngovernment to this, in the room of the Chevalier d'Yrujo, has been made\r\nunder the influence of the same motives; but still, the Chevalier d'Yrujo\r\nbeing intimately known to us, the integrity, sincerity, and reasonableness\r\nof his conduct having established in us a perfect confidence, in nowise\r\ndiminished by the bickerings which took place between him and a former\r\nSecretary of State, whose irritable temper drew on more than one affair\r\nof the same kind, it will be a subject of regret if we lose him. However,\r\nif the interests of Spain require that his services should be employed\r\nelsewhere, it is the duty of a friend to acquiesce; and we shall certainly\r\nreceive any successor the King may choose to send, with every possible\r\ndegree of favor and friendship. Our administration will not be collected\r\ntill the end of the ensuing month; and consequently, till then, no other\r\nof the mutual interests of the two nations will be under our views,\r\nexcept those general assurances of friendship which I have before given\r\nyou verbally, and now repeat. Accept, I pray you, assurances of my high\r\nconsideration and respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [15] [The manuscript here is illegible.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KNOX.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 27, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received with great pleasure your favor of the 16th, and\r\nit is with the greatest satisfaction I learn from all quarters that my\r\ninaugural address is considered as holding out a ground for conciliation\r\nand union. I am the more pleased with this, because the opinion therein\r\nstated as to the real ground of difference among us (to wit: the measures\r\nrendered most expedient by French enormities), is that which I have long\r\nentertained. I was always satisfied that the great body of those called\r\nfederalists were real republicans as well as federalists. I know, indeed,\r\nthere are monarchists among us. One character of these is in theory\r\nonly, and perfectly acquiescent in our form of government as it is, and\r\nnot entertaining a thought of destroying it merely on their theoretical\r\nopinions. A second class, at the head of which is our quondam colleague,\r\nare ardent for introduction of monarchy, eager for armies, making more\r\nnoise for a great naval establishment than better patriots, who wish\r\nit on a rational scale only, commensurate to our wants and our means.\r\nThis last class ought to be tolerated, but not trusted. Believing that\r\n(excepting the ardent monarchists) all our citizens agreed in ancient\r\nwhig principles, I thought it advisable to define and declare them, and\r\nlet them see the ground on which we could rally. And the fact proving\r\nto be so, that they agree in these principles, I shall pursue them with\r\nmore encouragement. I am aware that the necessity of a few removals for\r\nlegal oppressions, delinquencies, and other official malversations, may\r\nbe misconstrued as done for political opinions, and produce hesitation in\r\nthe coalition so much to be desired; but the extent of these will be too\r\nlimited to make permanent impressions. In the class of removals, however,\r\nI do not rank the new appointments which Mr. A. crowded in with whip and\r\nspur from the 12th of December, when the event of the election was known,\r\nand, consequently, that he was making appointments, not for himself,\r\nbut his successor, until 9 o'clock of the night, at 12 o'clock of which\r\nhe was to go out of office. This outrage on decency should not have its\r\neffect, except in the life appointments which are irremovable; but as to\r\nthe others I consider the nominations as nullities, and will not view\r\nthe persons appointed as even candidates for _their_ office, much less\r\nas possessing it by any title meriting respect. I mention these things\r\nthat the grounds and extent of the removals may be understood, and may\r\nnot disturb the tendency to union. Indeed that union is already effected,\r\nfrom New York southwardly, almost completely. In the New England States\r\nit will be slower than elsewhere, from particular circumstances better\r\nknown to yourself than me. But we will go on attending with the utmost\r\nsolicitude to their interests, doing them impartial justice, and I have no\r\ndoubt they will in time do justice to us. I have opened myself frankly,\r\nbecause I wish to be understood by those who mean well, and are disposed\r\nto be just towards me, as you are, and because I know you will use it for\r\ngood purposes only, and for none unfriendly to me. I leave this place in\r\na few days to make a short excursion home, but some domestic arrangements\r\nare necessary previous to my final removal here, which will be about the\r\nlatter end of April. Be so good as to present my respects to Mrs. Knox,\r\nand accept yourself assurances of my high consideration and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MESSRS. EDDY, RUSSEL, THURBER, WHEATON, AND SMITH.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON. March 27, 1801.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I return my sincere thanks for your kind congratulations\r\non my elevation to the first magistracy of the United States. I see\r\nwith pleasure every evidence of the attachment of my fellow citizens to\r\nelective government, calculated to promote their happiness, peculiarly\r\nadapted to their genius, habits, and situation, and the best permanent\r\ncorrective of the errors or abuses of those interests with power. The\r\nConstitution on which our union rests, shall be administered by me\r\naccording to the safe and honest meaning contemplated by the plain\r\nunderstanding of the people of the United States, at the time of its\r\nadoption,--a meaning to be found in the explanations of those who\r\nadvocated, not those who opposed it, and who opposed it merely least the\r\nconstructions should be applied which they denounced as possible. These\r\nexplanations are preserved in the publications of the time, and are too\r\nrecent in the memories of most men to admit of question. The energies of\r\nthe nation, as depends on me, shall be reserved for improvement of the\r\ncondition of man, not wasted in his distinction. The lamentable resource\r\nof war is not authorized for evils of imagination, but for those actual\r\ninjuries only, which would be more destructive of our well-being than war\r\nitself. Peace, justice, and liberal intercourse with all the nations of\r\nthe world, will, I hope, with all nations, characterize this commonwealth.\r\nAccept for yourselves, gentlemen, and the respectable citizens of the town\r\nof Providence, assurances of my high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GEORGE JEFFERSON.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 27, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of yours of March 4th, and to\r\nexpress to you the delight with which I found the just, disinterested, and\r\nhonorable point of view in which you saw the proposition it covered. The\r\nresolution you so properly approved had long been formed in my mind. The\r\npublic will never be made to believe that an appointment of a relative is\r\nmade on the ground of merit alone, uninfluenced by family views; nor can\r\nthey ever see with approbation offices, the disposal of which they entrust\r\nto their Presidents for public purposes, divided out as family property.\r\nMr. Adams degraded himself infinitely by his conduct on this subject, as\r\nGeneral Washington had done himself the greatest honor. With two such\r\nexamples to proceed by, I should be doubly inexcusable to err. It is\r\ntrue that this places the relations of the President in a worse situation\r\nthan if he were a stranger, but the public good, which cannot be affected\r\nif its confidence be lost, requires this sacrifice. Perhaps, too, it is\r\ncompensated by sharing in the public esteem. I could not be satisfied till\r\nI assured you of the increased esteem with which this transaction fills me\r\nfor you. Accept my affectionate expressions of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 29, 1801.\r\n\r\nI addressed a letter to you, my very dear and ancient friend, on the 4th\r\nof March: not indeed to you by name, but through the medium of some of\r\nmy fellow citizens, whom occasion called on me to address. In meditating\r\nthe matter of that address, I often asked myself, is this exactly in the\r\nspirit of the patriarch, Samuel Adams? Is it as he would express it? Will\r\nhe approve of it? I have felt a great deal for our country in the times\r\nwe have seen. But individually for no one so much as yourself. When I\r\nhave been told that you were avoided, insulted, frowned on, I could but\r\nejaculate, 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.' I\r\nconfess I felt an indignation for you, which for myself I have been able,\r\nunder every trial, to keep entirely passive. However, the storm is over,\r\nand we are in port. The ship was not rigged for the service she was put\r\non. We will show the smoothness of her motions on her republican tack. I\r\nhope we shall once more see harmony restored among our citizens, and an\r\nentire oblivion of past feuds. Some of the leaders who have most committed\r\nthemselves cannot come into this. But I hope the great body of our fellow\r\ncitizens will do it. I will sacrifice everything but principle to procure\r\nit. A few examples of justice on officers who have perverted their\r\nfunctions to the oppression of their fellow citizens, must, in justice\r\nto those citizens, be made. But opinion, and the just maintenance of it,\r\nshall never be a crime in my view: nor bring injury on the individual.\r\nThose whose misconduct in office ought to have produced their removal\r\neven by my predecessor, must not be protected by the delicacy due only to\r\nhonest men. How much I lament that time has deprived me of your aid. It\r\nwould have been a day of glory which should have called you to the first\r\noffice of the administration. But give us your counsel my friend, and give\r\nus your blessing; and be assured that there exists not in the heart of man\r\na more faithful esteem than mine to you, and that I shall ever bear you\r\nthe most affectionate veneration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 29, 1801.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--Your two letters of January the 15th and February the 24th,\r\ncame safely to hand, and I thank you for the history of a transaction\r\nwhich will ever be interesting in our affairs. It has been very precisely\r\nas I had imagined. I thought, on your return, that if you had come forward\r\nboldly, and appealed to the public by a full statement, it would have had\r\na great effect in your favor personally, and that of the republican cause\r\nthen oppressed almost unto death. But I judged from a tact of the southern\r\npulse. I suspect that of the north was different and decided your conduct;\r\nand perhaps it has been as well. If the revolution of sentiment has been\r\nlater, it has perhaps been not less sure. At length it has arrived. What\r\nwith the natural current of opinion which has been setting over to us\r\nfor eighteen months, and the immense impetus which was given it from the\r\n11th to the 17th of February, we may now say that the United States from\r\nNew York southwardly, are as unanimous in the principles of '76, as they\r\nwere in '76. The only difference is, that the leaders who remain behind\r\nare more numerous and bolder than the apostles of toryism in '76. The\r\nreason is, that we are now justly more tolerant than we could safely have\r\nbeen then, circumstanced as we were. Your part of the Union though as\r\nabsolutely republican as ours, had drunk deeper of the delusion, and is\r\ntherefore slower in recovering from it. The ægis of government, and the\r\ntemples of religion and of justice, have all been prostituted there to\r\ntoll us back to the times when we burnt witches. But your people will rise\r\nagain. They will awake like Sampson from his sleep, and carry away the\r\ngates and posts of the city. You, my friend, are destined to rally them\r\nagain under their former banner, and when called to the post, exercise\r\nit with firmness and with inflexible adherence to your own principles.\r\nThe people will support you, notwithstanding the howlings of the ravenous\r\ncrew from whose jaws they are escaping. It will be a great blessing to\r\nour country if we can once more restore harmony and social love among\r\nits citizens. I confess, as to myself, it is almost the first object of\r\nmy heart, and one to which I would sacrifice everything but principle.\r\nWith the people I have hopes of effecting it. But their Coryphæi are\r\nincurables. I expect little from them.\r\n\r\nI was not deluded by the eulogiums of the public papers in the first\r\nmoments of change. If they could have continued to get all the loaves and\r\nfishes, that is, if I would have gone over to them, they would continue\r\nto eulogise. But I well knew that the moment that such removals should\r\ntake place, as the justice of the preceding administration ought to have\r\nexecuted, their hue and cry would be set up, and they would take their old\r\nstand. I shall disregard that also. Mr. Adams' last appointments, when\r\nhe knew he was naming counsellors and aids for me and not for himself,\r\nI set aside as far as depends on me. Officers who have been guilty of\r\ngross abuses of office, such as marshals packing juries, &c., I shall now\r\nremove, as my predecessor ought in justice to have done. The instances\r\nwill be few, and governed by strict rule, and not party passion. The right\r\nof opinion shall suffer no invasion from me. Those who have acted well\r\nhave nothing to fear, however they may have differed from me in opinion:\r\nthose who have done ill, however, have nothing to hope; nor shall I fail\r\nto do justice lest it should be ascribed to that difference of opinion.\r\nA coalition of sentiments is not for the interest of the printers. They,\r\nlike the clergy, live by the zeal they can kindle, and the schisms they\r\ncan create. It is contest of opinion in politics as well as religion which\r\nmakes us take great interest in them, and bestow our money liberally\r\non those who furnish aliment to our appetite. The mild and simple\r\nprinciples of the Christian philosophy would produce too much calm, too\r\nmuch regularity of good, to extract from its disciples a support from a\r\nnumerous priesthood, were they not to sophisticate it, ramify it, split\r\nit into hairs, and twist its texts till they cover the divine morality of\r\nits author with mysteries, and require a priesthood to explain them. The\r\nQuakers seem to have discovered this. They have no priests, therefore no\r\nschisms. They judge of the text by the dictates of common sense and common\r\nmorality. So the printers can never leave us in a state of perfect rest\r\nand union of opinion. They would be no longer useful, and would have to\r\ngo to the plough. In the first moments of quietude which have succeeded\r\nthe election, they seem to have aroused their lying faculties beyond their\r\nordinary state, to re-agitate the public mind. What appointments to office\r\nhave they detailed which had never been thought of, merely to found a text\r\nfor their calumniating commentaries. However, the steady character of our\r\ncountrymen is a rock to which we may safely moor; and notwithstanding the\r\nefforts of the papers to disseminate early discontents, I expect that a\r\njust, dispassionate and steady conduct, will at length rally to a proper\r\nsystem the great body of our country. Unequivocal in principle, reasonable\r\nin manner, we shall be able I hope to do a great deal of good to the cause\r\nof freedom and harmony. I shall be happy to hear from you often, to know\r\nyour own sentiments and those of others on the course of things, and to\r\nconcur with you in efforts for the common good. Your letters through the\r\npost will not come safely. Present my best respects to Mrs. Gerry, and\r\naccept yourself assurances of my constant esteem and high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR WALTER JONES.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 31, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I was already almost in the act of mounting my horse for\r\na short excursion home, when your favor of the 14th was put into my\r\nhands. I stop barely to acknowledge it, and to thank you for your kind\r\ncongratulations, and still more for your interesting observations on the\r\ncourse of things. I am sensible how far I should fall short of effecting\r\nall the reformation which reason would suggest, and experience approve,\r\nwere I free to do whatever I thought best; but when we reflect how\r\ndifficult it is to move or inflect the great machine of society, how\r\nimpossible to advance the notions of a whole people suddenly to ideal\r\nright, we see the wisdom of Solon's remark, that no more good must be\r\nattempted than the nation can bear, and that all will be chiefly to reform\r\nthe waste of public money, and thus drive away the vultures who prey\r\nupon it, and improve some little on old routines. Some new fences for\r\nsecuring constitutional rights may, with the aid of a good legislature,\r\nperhaps be attainable. I am going home for three weeks, to make some final\r\narrangements there for my removal hither. Mr. Madison and Mr. Gallatin\r\nwill be here by the last of the month. Dearborne and Lincoln remain here;\r\nand General Smith entered yesterday on the naval department, but only\r\n_pro tempore_, and to give me time to look for what cannot be obtained--a\r\nprominent officer, equal and willing to undertake the duties. Accept\r\nassurances of my constant and affectionate respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A. STUART, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 MONTICELLO, April 8, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I arrived here on the 4th, and expect to stay a fortnight,\r\nin order to make some arrangements preparatory to my final removal\r\nto Washington. You know that the last Congress established a Western\r\njudiciary district in Virginia, comprehending chiefly the Western\r\ncounties. Mr. Adams, who continued filling all the offices till nine\r\no'clock of the night, at twelve of which he was to go out of office\r\nhimself, took care to appoint for this district also. The judge, of\r\ncourse, stands till the law shall be repealed, which we trust will be\r\nat the next Congress. But as to all others, I made it immediately known\r\nthat I should consider them as nullities, and appoint others, as I think\r\nI have a preferable right to name agents for my own administration, at\r\nleast to the vacancies falling after it was known that Mr. Adams was not\r\nnaming for himself. Consequently, we want an attorney and marshal for\r\nthe Western district. I have thought of Mr. Coalter, but I am told he\r\nhas a clerkship incompatible with it by our laws. I thought also of Hugh\r\nHolmes; but I fear he is so far off, he would not attend the court, which\r\nis to be in Rockbridge, I believe. This is the extent of my personal\r\nknowledge. Pray recommend one to me, as also a marshal; and let them be\r\nthe most respectable and unexceptionable possible, and especially let\r\nthem be republicans. The only shield for our republican citizens against\r\nthe federalism of the courts is to have the attorneys and marshals\r\nrepublicans. There is nothing I am so anxious about as good nominations,\r\nconscious that the merit as well as reputation of an administration\r\ndepends as much on that as on its measures.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant esteem and high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HUGH WHITE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                   WASHINGTON, May 2, 1801.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The satisfaction which, in the name of the foreigners residing\r\nin Beaver County, you are pleased to express in my appointment to\r\nthe Presidency of the United States, the expectations you form of the\r\ncharacter of my administration, and your kind wishes for my happiness,\r\ndemand my sincere thanks. Born in other countries, yet believing you\r\ncould be happy in this, our laws acknowledge, as they should do, your\r\nright to join us in society, conforming, as I doubt not you will do, to\r\nour established rules. That these rules shall be as equal as prudential\r\nconsiderations will admit, will certainly be the aim of our legislatures,\r\ngeneral and particular. To unequal privileges among members of the same\r\nsociety the spirit of our nation is, with one accord, adverse. If the\r\n_unexample_ state of the world has in any instance occasioned among us\r\ntemporary departures from the system of equal rule, the restoration\r\nof tranquillity will doubtless produce reconsideration; and your own\r\nknowledge of the liberal conduct heretofore observed towards strangers\r\nsettling among us will warrant the belief that what is right will be done.\r\nAccept a reciprocation of wishes for your present and future welfare, and\r\nassurances of my high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GIDEON GRANGER.\r\n\r\n                                                   WASHINGTON, May 3, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I wrote you on the 29th of March. Yours of the 25th of that\r\nmonth, with the address it covered, had not reached this place on the 1st\r\nof April, when I set out on a short visit to my residence in Virginia,\r\nwhere some arrangements were necessary previous to my settlement here. In\r\nfact, your letter came to me at Monticello only the 24th of April, two\r\ndays before my departure from thence. This, I hope, will sufficiently\r\napologize for the delay of the answer, which those unapprised of these\r\ncircumstances will have thought extraordinary.\r\n\r\nA new subject of congratulation has arisen. I mean the regeneration of\r\nRhode Island. I hope it is the beginning of that resurrection of the\r\ngenuine spirit of New England which rises for life eternal. According\r\nto natural order, Vermont will emerge next, because least, after Rhode\r\nIsland, under the yoke of hierocracy. I have never dreamed that all\r\nopposition was to cease. The clergy, who have missed their union with the\r\nState, the Anglomen, who have missed their union with England, and the\r\npolitical adventurers, who have lost the chance of swindling and plunder\r\nin the waste of public money, will never cease to bawl, on the breaking up\r\nof their sanctuary. But among the people, the schism is healed, and with\r\ntender treatment the wound will not re-open. Their quondam leaders have\r\nbeen astounded with the suddenness of the desertion; and their silence and\r\nappearance of acquiescence have proceeded not from a thought of joining\r\nus, but the uncertainty what ground to take. The very first acts of the\r\nadministration, the nominations, have accordingly furnished something\r\nto yelp on; and all our subsequent acts will furnish them fresh matter,\r\nbecause there is nothing against which human ingenuity will not be able to\r\nfind something to say.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my sincere attachment and high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO NATHANIEL MACON.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 14, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favors of April the 20th and 23d had been received, and\r\nthe commission made out for Mr. Potts, before I received the letter of the\r\n1st instant. I have still thought it better to forward the commission,\r\nin the hope that reconsideration, or the influence of yourself and\r\nfriends, might induce an acceptance of it. Should it be otherwise, you\r\nmust recommend some other good person, as I had rather be guided by your\r\nopinion than that of the person you refer me to. Perhaps Mr. Potts may be\r\nwilling to stop the gap till you meet and repeal the law. If he does not,\r\nlet me receive a recommendation from you as quickly as possible. And in\r\nall cases, when an office becomes vacant in your State, as the distance\r\nwould occasion a great delay were you to wait to be regularly consulted,\r\nI shall be much obliged to you to recommend the best characters. There is\r\nnothing I am so anxious about as making the best possible appointments,\r\nand no case in which the best men are more liable to mislead us, by\r\nyielding to the solicitations of applicants. For this reason your\r\nown spontaneous recommendation would be desirable. Now to answer your\r\nparticulars, _seriatim_,--\r\n\r\nLevees are done away.\r\n\r\nThe first communication to the next Congress will be, like all subsequent\r\nones, by message, to which no answer will be expected.\r\n\r\nThe diplomatic establishment in Europe will be reduced to three ministers.\r\n\r\nThe compensations to collectors depend on you, and not on\r\n\r\nThe army is undergoing a chaste reformation.\r\n\r\nThe navy will be reduced to the legal establishment by the last of this\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nAgencies in every department will be revised.\r\n\r\nWe shall push you to the uttermost in economising.\r\n\r\nA very early recommendation had been given to the Post Master General to\r\nemploy no printer, foreigner, or revolutionary tory in any of his offices.\r\nThis department is still untouched.\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Mr. Gallatin yesterday, completed the organization of our\r\nadministration.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my sincere esteem and high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF RHODE ISLAND AND PROVIDENCE PLANTATIONS.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 26, 1801.\r\n\r\nI return my grateful thanks to the General Assembly of the State of Rhode\r\nIsland and Providence Plantations, for the congratulations which, on\r\nbehalf of themselves and their constituents, they have been pleased to\r\nexpress on my election to the Chief Magistracy of the United States; and\r\nI learn with pleasure their approbation of the principles declared by me\r\non that occasion; principles which flowed sincerely from the heart and\r\njudgment, and which, with sincerity, will be pursued. While acting on\r\nthem, I ask only to be judged with truth and candor.\r\n\r\nTo preserve the peace of our fellow citizens, promote their prosperity\r\nand happiness, reunite opinion, cultivate a spirit of candor, moderation,\r\ncharity, and forbearance towards one another, are objects calling for\r\nthe efforts and sacrifices of every good man and patriot. Our religion\r\nenjoins it; our happiness demands it; and no sacrifice is requisite but of\r\npassions hostile to both.\r\n\r\nIt is a momentous truth, and happily of universal impression on the public\r\nmind, that our safety rests on the preservation of our Union. Our citizens\r\nhave wisely formed themselves into one nation as to others, and several\r\nStates as among themselves. To the united nation belongs our external and\r\nmutual relations, to each State severally the care of our persons, our\r\nproperty, our reputation, and religious freedom. This wise distribution,\r\nif carefully preserved, will prove, I trust from example, that while\r\nsmaller governments are better adapted to the ordinary objects of society,\r\nlarger confederations more effectually secure independence and the\r\npreservation of republican government.\r\n\r\nI am sensible of the great interest which your State justly feels in\r\nthe prosperity of commerce. It is of vital interest also to States more\r\nagricultural, whose produce, without commerce, could not be exchanged. As\r\nthe handmaid of agriculture therefore, commerce will be cherished by me\r\nboth from principle and duty.\r\n\r\nAccept, I beseech you, for the General Assembly of the State of Rhode\r\nIsland and Providence Plantations, the homage of my high consideration and\r\nrespect, and I pray God to have them always in his safe and holy keeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 11, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 15th came to hand on the 25th of June, and\r\nconveyed a great deal of that information which I am anxious to receive.\r\nThe consolidation of our fellow citizens in general is the great object\r\nwe ought to keep in view, and that being once obtained, while we associate\r\nwith us in affairs, to a certain degree, the federal sect of republicans,\r\nwe must strip of all the means of influence the Essex junto, and their\r\nassociate monocrats in every part of the Union. The former differ from\r\nus only in the shades of power to be given to the executive, being,\r\nwith us, attached to republican government. The latter wish to sap the\r\nrepublic by fraud, if they cannot destroy it by force, and to erect an\r\nEnglish monarchy in its place; some of them (as Mr. Adams) thinking its\r\ncorrupt parts should be cleansed away, others (as Hamilton) thinking that\r\nwould make it an impracticable machine. We are proceeding gradually in\r\nthe regeneration of offices, and introducing republicans to some share\r\nin them. I do not know that it will be pushed further than was settled\r\nbefore you went away, except as to Essex men. I must ask you to make out\r\na list of those in office in yours and the neighboring States, and to\r\nfurnish me with it. There is little of this spirit south of the Hudson. I\r\nunderstand that Jackson is a very determined one, though in private life\r\namiable and honorable. But amiable monarchists are not safe subjects of\r\nrepublican confidence. What will be the effect of his removal? How should\r\nit be timed? Who his successor? What place can General Lyman properly\r\noccupy? Our gradual reformations seem to produce good effects everywhere\r\nexcept in Connecticut. Their late session of legislature has been more\r\nintolerant than all others. We must meet them with equal intolerance. When\r\nthey will give a share in the State offices, they shall be replaced in\r\na share of the General offices. Till then we must follow their example.\r\nMr. Goodrich's removal has produced a bitter _remonstrance_, with much\r\npersonality against the two Bishops. I am sincerely sorry to see the\r\ninflexibility of the _federal_ spirit there, for I cannot believe they are\r\n_all monarchists_.\r\n\r\nI observe your tory papers make much of the Berceau. As that is one of\r\nthe subjects to be laid before Congress, it is material to commit to\r\nwriting, while fresh in memory, the important circumstances. You possess\r\nmore of these than any other person. I pray you, therefore, immediately\r\nto state to me all the circumstances you recollect. I will aid you with\r\nthe following hints, which you can correct and incorporate. Pichon, I\r\nthink, arrived about the 12th of March. I do not remember when he first\r\nproposed the question about the Insurgente and Berceau. On the 20th of\r\nMarch, Mr. Stoddart wrote to his agent at Boston to put the Berceau into\r\nhandsome order to be restored, but whether he did that of his own accord,\r\nor after previous consultation with you or myself, I do not recollect. I\r\nset out for Monticello April the 1st. About that time General Smith sent\r\nnew directions to put her precisely into the state in which she was before\r\nthe capture. Do you recollect from what fund it was contemplated to do\r\nthis? I had trusted for this to Stoddart, who was familiar with all the\r\nfunds, being myself entirely new in office at that time. What will those\r\nrepairs have cost? Did we not leave to Le Tombe to make what allowance he\r\nthought proper to the officers, we only advancing money on his undertaking\r\nrepayment? I shall hope to receive from you as full a statement as you can\r\nmake. It may be useful to inquire into the time and circumstances of her\r\nbeing dismantled. When you shall have retraced the whole matter in your\r\nmemory, would it not be well to make a summary statement of the important\r\ncircumstances for insertion in the Chronicle, in order to set the minds\r\nof the candid part of the public to rights? Mr. Madison has had a slight\r\nbilious attack. I am advising him to get off by the middle of this month.\r\nWe who have stronger constitutions shall stay to the end of it. But during\r\nAugust and September, we also must take refuge in climates rendered safer\r\nby our habits and confidence. The post will be so arranged as that letters\r\nwill go hence to Monticello, and the answer return here in a week. I hope\r\nI shall continue to hear from you there.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my affectionate esteem and high respect.\r\n\r\nP. S. The French convention was laid before the Senate December the 16th.\r\nI think the Berceau arrived afterwards. If so, she was dismantled, when it\r\nwas known she was to be restored. When did she arrive? By whose orders was\r\nshe dismantled?\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 11, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As to the mode of correspondence between the general and\r\nparticular executives, I do not think myself a good judge. Not because my\r\nposition gives me any prejudice on the occasion; for if it be possible\r\nto be certainly conscious of anything, I am conscious of feeling no\r\ndifference between writing to the highest and lowest being on earth;\r\nbut because I have ever thought that forms should yield to whatever\r\nshould facilitate business. Comparing the two governments together, it\r\nis observable that in all those cases where the independent or reserved\r\nrights of the States are in question, the two executives, if they are\r\nto act together, must be exactly co-ordinate; they are, in these cases,\r\neach the supreme head of an independent government. In other cases, to\r\nwit, those transferred by the Constitution to the General Government,\r\nthe general executive is certainly pre-ordinate; _e. g._ in a question\r\nrespecting the militia, and others easily to be recollected. Were there,\r\ntherefore, to be a stiff adherence to etiquette, I should say that in the\r\nformer cases the correspondence should be between the two heads, and that\r\nin the latter, the Governor must be subject to receive orders from the war\r\ndepartment as any other subordinate officer would. And were it observed\r\nthat either party set up unjustifiable pretensions, perhaps the other\r\nmight be right in opposing them by a tenaciousness of his own rigorous\r\nrights. But I think the practice in General Washington's administration\r\nwas most friendly to business, and was absolutely equal; sometimes he\r\nwrote to the Governors, and sometimes the heads of departments wrote.\r\nIf a letter is to be on a general subject, I see no reason why the\r\nPresident should not write; but if it is to go into details, these being\r\nknown only to the head of the department, it is better he should write\r\ndirectly. Otherwise, the correspondence must involve circuities. If this\r\nbe practised promiscuously in both classes of cases, each party setting\r\nexamples of neglecting etiquette, both will stand on equal ground, and\r\nconvenience alone will dictate through whom any particular communication\r\nis to be made. On the whole, I think a free correspondence best, and shall\r\nnever hesitate to write myself to the Governors, in every federal case,\r\nwhere the occasion presents itself to me particularly. Accept assurances\r\nof my sincere and constant affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELIAS SHIPMAN AND OTHERS, A COMMITTEE OF THE MERCHANTS OF NEW HAVEN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 12, 1801.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I have received the remonstrance you were pleased to address\r\nto me, on the appointment of Samuel Bishop to the office of collector of\r\nNew Haven, lately vacated by the death of David Austin. The right of our\r\nfellow citizens to represent to the public functionaries their opinion\r\non proceedings interesting to them, is unquestionably a constitutional\r\nright, often useful, sometimes necessary, and will always be respectfully\r\nacknowledged by me.\r\n\r\nOf the various executive duties, no one excites more anxious concern\r\nthan that of placing the interests of our fellow citizens in the hands of\r\nhonest men, with understandings sufficient for their stations. No duty, at\r\nthe same time, is more difficult to fulfil. The knowledge of characters\r\npossessed by a single individual is, of necessity, limited. To seek out\r\nthe best through the whole Union, we must resort to other information,\r\nwhich, from the best of men, acting disinterestedly and with the purest\r\nmotives, is sometimes incorrect. In the case of Samuel Bishop, however,\r\nthe subject of your remonstrance, time was taken, information was sought,\r\nand such obtained as could leave no room for doubt of his fitness. From\r\nprivate sources it was learned that his understanding was sound, his\r\nintegrity pure, his character unstained. And the offices confided to him\r\nwithin his own State, are public evidences of the estimation in which he\r\nis held by the State in general, and the city and township particularly\r\nin which he lives. He is said to be the town clerk, a justice of the\r\npeace, mayor of the city of New Haven, an office held at the will of\r\nthe legislature, chief judge of the court of common pleas for New Haven\r\ncounty, a court of high criminal and civil jurisdiction wherein most\r\ncauses are decided without the right of appeal or review, and sole judge\r\nof the court of probates, wherein he singly decides all questions of\r\nwills, settlement of estates, testate and intestate, appoints guardians,\r\nsettles their accounts, and in fact has under his jurisdiction and care\r\nall the property real and personal of persons dying. The two last offices,\r\nin the annual gift of the legislature, were given to him in May last. Is\r\nit possible that the man to whom the legislature of Connecticut has so\r\nrecently committed trusts of such difficulty and magnitude, is 'unfit to\r\nbe the collector of the district of New Haven,' though acknowledged in\r\nthe same writing, to have obtained all this confidence 'by a long life\r\nof usefulness?' It is objected, indeed, in the remonstrance, that he is\r\nseventy-seven years of age; but at a much more advanced age, our Franklin\r\nwas the ornament of human nature. He may not be able to perform in person,\r\nall the details of his office; but if he gives us the benefit of his\r\nunderstanding, his integrity, his watchfulness, and takes care that all\r\nthe details are well performed by himself or his necessary assistants,\r\nall public purposes will be answered. The remonstrance, indeed, does not\r\nallege that the office _has been_ illy conducted, but only apprehends that\r\nit _will be_ so. Should this happen in event, be assured I will do in it\r\nwhat shall be just and necessary for the public service. In the meantime,\r\nhe should be tried without being prejudged.\r\n\r\nThe removal, as it is called, of Mr. Goodrich, forms another subject of\r\ncomplaint. Declarations by myself in favor of _political tolerance_,\r\nexhortations to _harmony_ and affection in social intercourse, and\r\nto respect for the _equal rights_ of the minority, have, on certain\r\noccasions, been quoted and misconstrued into assurances that the tenure of\r\noffices was to be undisturbed. But could candor apply such a construction?\r\nIt is not indeed in the remonstrance that we find it; but it leads to the\r\nexplanations which that calls for. When it is considered, that during the\r\nlate administration, those who were not of a particular sect of politics\r\nwere excluded from all office; when, by a steady pursuit of this measure,\r\nnearly the whole offices of the United States were monopolized by that\r\nsect; when the public sentiment at length declared itself, and burst\r\nopen the doors of honor and confidence to those whose opinions they more\r\napproved, was it to be imagined that this monopoly of office was still to\r\nbe continued in the hands of the minority? Does it violate their _equal\r\nrights_, to assert some rights in the majority also? Is it _political\r\nintolerance_ to claim a proportionate share in the direction of the public\r\naffairs? Can they not _harmonize_ in society unless they have everything\r\nin their own hands? If the will of the nation, manifested by their\r\nvarious elections, calls for an administration of government according\r\nwith the opinions of those elected; if, for the fulfilment of that will,\r\ndisplacements are necessary, with whom can they so justly begin as with\r\npersons appointed in the last moments of an administration, not for its\r\nown aid, but to begin a career at the same time with their successors,\r\nby whom they had never been approved, and who could scarcely expect from\r\nthem a cordial co-operation? Mr. Goodrich was one of these. Was it proper\r\nfor him to place himself in office, without knowing whether those whose\r\nagent he was to be would have confidence in his agency? Can the preference\r\nof another, as the successor to Mr. Austin, be candidly called a removal\r\nof Mr. Goodrich? If a due participation of office is a matter of right,\r\nhow are vacancies to be obtained? Those by death are few; by resignation,\r\nnone. Can any other mode than that of removal be proposed? This is a\r\npainful office; but it is made my duty, and I meet it as such. I proceed\r\nin the operation with deliberation and inquiry, that it may injure the\r\nbest men least, and effect the purposes of justice and public utility with\r\nthe least private distress; that it may be thrown, as much as possible,\r\non delinquency, on oppression, on intolerance, on ante-revolutionary\r\nadherence to our enemies.\r\n\r\nThe remonstrance laments \"that a change in the administration must produce\r\na change in the subordinate officers;\" in other words, that it should be\r\ndeemed necessary for all officers to think with their principal? But on\r\nwhom does this imputation bear? On those who have excluded from office\r\nevery shade of opinion which was not theirs? Or on those who have been\r\nso excluded? I lament sincerely that unessential differences of opinion\r\nshould ever have been deemed sufficient to interdict half the society\r\nfrom the rights and the blessings of self-government, to proscribe them\r\nas unworthy of every trust. It would have been to me a circumstance of\r\ngreat relief, had I found a moderate participation of office in the hands\r\nof the majority. I would gladly have left to time and accident to raise\r\nthem to their just share. But their total exclusion calls for prompter\r\ncorrections. I shall correct the procedure; but that done, return with joy\r\nto that state of things, when the only questions concerning a candidate\r\nshall be, is he honest? Is he capable? Is he faithful to the Constitution?\r\n\r\nI tender you the homage of my high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 26, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of July the 28th was received here on the 20th\r\ninstant. The superscription of my letter of July the 11th by another hand\r\nwas to prevent danger to it from the curious. Your statement respecting\r\nthe Berceau coincided with my own recollection, in the circumstances\r\nrecollected by me, and I concur with you in supposing it may not now be\r\nnecessary to give any explanations on the subject in the papers. The\r\npurchase was made by our predecessors, and the repairs begun by them.\r\nHad she been to continue ours, we were authorized to put and keep her in\r\ngood order out of the fund of the naval contingencies; and when in good\r\norder, we obeyed a law of the land, the treaty, in giving her up. It\r\nis true the treaty was not ratified; but when ratified, it is validated\r\nretrospectively. We took on ourselves this risk, but France had put more\r\ninto our hands on the same risk. I do not know whether the clamor, as\r\nto the allowance to the French officers of their regular pay, has been\r\nrectified by a statement that it was on the request of the French consul,\r\nand his promise to repay it. So that they cost the United States, on this\r\narrangement, nothing.\r\n\r\nI am glad to learn from you that the answer to New Haven had a good\r\neffect in Massachusetts on the republicans, and no ill effects on the\r\nsincere federalists. I had foreseen, years ago, that the first republican\r\nPresident who should come into office after all the places in the\r\ngovernment had become exclusively occupied by federalists, would have\r\na dreadful operation to perform. That the republicans would consent to\r\na continuation of everything in federal hands, was not to be expected,\r\nbecause neither just nor politic. On him, then, was to devolve the office\r\nof an executioner, that of lopping off. I cannot say that it has worked\r\nharder than I expected. You know the moderation of our views in this\r\nbusiness, and that we all concurred in them. We determined to proceed with\r\ndeliberation. This produced impatience in the republicans, and a belief\r\nwe meant to do nothing. Some occasion of public explanation was eagerly\r\ndesired, when the New Haven remonstrance offered us that occasion. The\r\nanswer was meant as an explanation to our friends. It has had on them,\r\neverywhere, the most wholesome effect. Appearances of schismatizing from\r\nus have been entirely done away. I own I expected it would check the\r\ncurrent with which the republican federalists were returning to their\r\nbrethren, the republicans. I extremely lamented this effect; for the\r\nmoment which should convince me that a healing of the nation into one is\r\nimpracticable, would be the last moment of my wishing to remain where\r\nI am. (Of the monarchical federalists I have no expectations. They are\r\nincurables, to be taken care of in a mad house, if necessary, and on\r\nmotives of charity.) I am much pleased, therefore, with your information\r\nthat the republican federalists are still coming in to the desired union.\r\nThe Eastern newspapers had given me a different impression, because\r\nI supposed the printers knew the taste of their customers, and cooked\r\ntheir dishes to their palates. The Palladium is understood to be the\r\n_clerical_ paper, and from the clergy I expect no mercy. They crucified\r\ntheir Saviour, who preached that their kingdom was not of this world; and\r\nall who practise on that precept must expect the extreme of their wrath.\r\nThe laws of the present day withhold their hands from blood; but lies and\r\nslander still remain to them.\r\n\r\nI am satisfied that the heaping of abuse on me, personally, has been\r\nwith the design and the hope of provoking me to make a general sweep of\r\nall federalists out of office. But as I have carried no passion into the\r\nexecution of this disagreeable duty, I shall suffer none to be excited.\r\nThe clamor which has been raised will not provoke me to remove one more,\r\nnor deter me from removing one less, than if not a word had been said\r\non the subject. In Massachusetts, you may be assured, great moderation\r\nwill be used. Indeed, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and\r\nDelaware, are the only States where anything considerable is desired. In\r\nthe course of the summer all which is necessary will be done; and we may\r\nhope that this cause of offence being at an end, the measures we shall\r\npursue and propose for the amelioration of the public affairs will be so\r\nconfessedly salutary as to unite all men not monarchists in principle.\r\n\r\nWe have considerable hopes of republican senators from South Carolina,\r\nMaryland and Delaware, and some as to Vermont. In any event, we are\r\nsecure of a majority in the Senate; and consequently that there will be\r\na concert of action between the Legislature and executive. The removal\r\nof excrescences from the judiciary is the universal demand. We propose to\r\nre-assemble at Washington on the last day of September. Accept assurances\r\nof my affectionate esteem and high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 9, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--You will receive, probably by this post, from the Secretary\r\nof State, his final instructions for your mission to France. We have not\r\nthought it necessary to say anything in them on the great question of the\r\nmaritime law of nations, which at present agitates Europe; that is to say,\r\nwhether free ships shall make free goods; because we do not mean to take\r\nany side in it during the war. But, as I had before communicated to you\r\nsome loose thoughts on that subject, and have since considered it with\r\nsomewhat more attention, I have thought it might be useful that you should\r\npossess my ideas in a more matured form than that in which they were\r\nbefore given. Unforeseen circumstances may perhaps oblige you to hazard an\r\nopinion, on some occasion or other, on this subject, and it is better that\r\nit should not be at variance with ours. I write this, too, myself, that\r\nit may not be considered as official, but merely my individual opinion,\r\nunadvised by those official counsellors whose opinions I deem my safest\r\nguide, and should unquestionably take in form, were circumstances to call\r\nfor a solemn decision of the question.\r\n\r\nWhen Europe assumed the general form in which it is occupied by the\r\nnations now composing it, and turned its attention to maritime commerce,\r\nwe found among its earliest practices, that of taking the goods of\r\nan enemy from the ship of a friend; and that into this practice every\r\nmaritime State went sooner or later, as it appeared on the theatre of\r\nthe ocean. If, therefore, we are to consider the practice of nations as\r\nthe sole and sufficient evidence of the law of nature among nations, we\r\nshould unquestionably place this principle among those of the natural\r\nlaws. But its inconveniences, as they affected neutral nations peaceably\r\npursuing their commerce, and its tendency to embroil them with the powers\r\nhappening to be at war, and thus to extend the flames of war, induced\r\nnations to introduce by special compacts, from time to time, a more\r\nconvenient rule; that \"free ships should make free goods;\" and this latter\r\nprinciple has by every maritime nation of Europe been established, to\r\na greater or less degree, in its treaties with other nations; insomuch,\r\nthat all of them have, more or less frequently, assented to it, as a rule\r\nof action in particular cases. Indeed, it is now urged, and I think with\r\ngreat appearance of reason, that this is the genuine principle dictated\r\nby national morality; and that the first practice arose from accident,\r\nand the particular convenience of the States[16] which first figured on\r\nthe water, rather than from well-digested reflections on the relations of\r\nfriend and enemy, on the rights of territorial jurisdiction, and on the\r\ndictates of moral law applied to these. Thus it had never been supposed\r\nlawful, in the territory of a friend to seize the goods of an enemy.\r\nOn an element which nature has not subjected to the jurisdiction of any\r\nparticular nation, but has made common to all for the purposes to which it\r\nis fitted, it would seem that the particular portion of it which happens\r\nto be occupied by the vessel of any nation, in the course of its voyage,\r\nis for the moment, the exclusive property of that nation, and, with the\r\nvessel, is exempt from intrusion by any other, and from its jurisdiction,\r\nas much as if it were lying in the harbor of its sovereign. In no country,\r\nwe believe, is the rule otherwise, as to the subjects of property common\r\nto all. Thus the place occupied by an individual in a highway, a church,\r\na theatre, or other public assembly, cannot be intruded on, while its\r\noccupant holds it for the purposes of its institution. The persons on\r\nboard a vessel traversing the ocean, carrying with them the laws of their\r\nnation, have among themselves a jurisdiction, a police, not established\r\nby their individual will, but by the authority of their nation, of whose\r\nterritory their vessel still seems to compose a part, so long as it does\r\nenter the exclusive territory of another. No nation ever pretended a right\r\nto govern by their laws the ship of another nation navigating the ocean.\r\nBy what law then can it enter that ship while in peaceable and orderly\r\nuse of the common element? We recognize no natural precept for submission\r\nto such a right; and perceive no distinction between the movable and\r\nimmovable jurisdiction of a friend, which would authorize the entering the\r\none and not the other, to seize the property of an enemy.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that this proves too much, as it proves you cannot\r\nenter the ship of a friend to search for contraband of war. But this\r\nis not proving too much. We believe the practice of seizing what is\r\ncalled contraband of war, is an abusive practice, not founded in natural\r\nright. War between two nations cannot diminish the rights of the rest\r\nof the world remaining at peace. The doctrine that the rights of nations\r\nremaining quietly in the exercise of moral and social duties, are to give\r\nway to the convenience of those who prefer plundering and murdering one\r\nanother, is a monstrous doctrine; and ought to yield to the more rational\r\nlaw, that \"the wrong which two nations endeavor to inflict on each other,\r\nmust not infringe on the rights or conveniences of those remaining at\r\npeace.\" And what is _contraband_, by the law of nature? Either everything\r\nwhich may aid or comfort an enemy, or nothing. Either all commerce which\r\nwould accommodate him is unlawful, or none is. The difference between\r\narticles of one or another description, is a difference in degree only. No\r\nline between them can be drawn. Either all intercourse must cease between\r\nneutrals and belligerents, or all be permitted. Can the world hesitate to\r\nsay which shall be the rule? Shall two nations turning tigers, break up in\r\none instant the peaceable relations of the whole world? Reason and nature\r\nclearly pronounce that the neutral is to go on in the enjoyment of all its\r\nrights, that its commerce remains free, not subject to the jurisdiction of\r\nanother, nor consequently its vessels to search, or to enquiries whether\r\ntheir contents are the property of an enemy, or are of those which have\r\nbeen called contraband of war.\r\n\r\nNor does this doctrine contravene the right of preventing vessels from\r\nentering a blockaded port. This right stands on other ground. When the\r\nfleet of any nation actually beleaguers the port of its enemy, no other\r\nhas a right to enter their line, any more than their line of battle in\r\nthe open sea, or their lines of circumvallation, or of encampment, or\r\nof battle array on land. The space included within their lines in any\r\nof those cases, is either the property of their enemy, or it is common\r\nproperty assumed and possessed for the moment, which cannot be intruded\r\non, even by a neutral, without committing the very trespass we are now\r\nconsidering, that of intruding into the lawful possession of a friend.\r\n\r\nAlthough I consider the observance of these principles as of great\r\nimportance to the interests of peaceable nations, among whom I hope the\r\nUnited States will ever place themselves, yet in the present state of\r\nthings they are not worth a war. Nor do I believe war the most certain\r\nmeans of enforcing them. Those peaceable coercions which are in the power\r\nof every nation, if undertaken in concert and in time of peace, are more\r\nlikely to produce the desired effect.\r\n\r\nThe opinions I have here given are those which have generally been\r\nsanctioned by our government. In our treaties with France, the United\r\nNetherlands, Sweden and Prussia, the principle of free bottom, free\r\ngoods, was uniformly maintained. In the instructions of 1784, given by\r\nCongress to their ministers appointed to treat with the nations of Europe\r\ngenerally, the same principle, and the doing away contraband of war, were\r\nenjoined, and were acceded to in the treaty signed with Portugal. In the\r\nlate treaty with England, indeed, that power perseveringly refused the\r\nprinciple of free bottoms, free goods; and it was avoided in the late\r\ntreaty with Prussia, at the instance of our then administration, lest\r\nit should seem to take side in a question then threatening decision by\r\nthe sword. At the commencement of the war between France and England,\r\nthe representative of the French republic then residing in the United\r\nStates, complaining that the British armed ships captured French property\r\nin American bottoms, insisted that the principle of \"free bottoms, free\r\ngoods,\" was of the acknowledged law of nations; that the violation of that\r\nprinciple by the British was a wrong committed on us, and such an one as\r\nwe ought to repel by joining in the war against that country. We denied\r\nhis position, and appealed to the universal practice of Europe, in proof\r\nthat the principle of \"free bottoms, free goods,\" was not acknowledged\r\nas of the natural law of nations, but only of its conventional law. And I\r\nbelieve we may safely affirm, that not a single instance can be produced\r\nwhere any nation of Europe, acting professedly under the law of nations\r\nalone, unrestrained by treaty, has, either by its executive or judiciary\r\norgans, decided on the principle of \"free bottoms, free goods.\" Judging\r\nof the law of nations by what has been _practised_ among nations, we were\r\nauthorized to say that the contrary principle was their rule, and this\r\nbut an exception to it, introduced by special treaties in special cases\r\nonly; that having no treaty with England substituting this instead of\r\nthe ordinary rule, we had neither the right nor the disposition to go to\r\nwar for its establishment. But though we would not then, nor will we now,\r\nengage in war to establish this principle, we are nevertheless sincerely\r\nfriendly to it. We think that the nations of Europe have originally set\r\nout in error; that experience has proved the error oppressive to the\r\nrights and interests of the peaceable part of mankind; that every nation\r\nbut one has acknowledged this, by consenting to the change, and that one\r\nhas consented in particular cases; that nations have a right to correct\r\nan erroneous principle, and to establish that which is right as their\r\nrule of action; and if they should adopt measures for effecting this in\r\na peaceable way, we shall wish them success, and not stand in their way\r\nto it. But should it become, at any time, expedient for us to co-operate\r\nin the establishment of this principle, the opinion of the executive, on\r\nthe advice of its constitutional counsellors, must then be given; and that\r\nof the legislature, an independent and essential organ in the operation,\r\nmust also be expressed; in forming which, they will be governed, every\r\nman by his own judgment, and may, very possibly, judge differently from\r\nthe executive. With the same honest views, the most honest men often form\r\ndifferent conclusions. As far, however, as we can judge, the principle of\r\n\"free bottoms, free goods,\" is that which would carry the wishes of our\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nWishing you smooth seas and prosperous gales, with the enjoyment of good\r\nhealth, I tender you the assurances of my constant friendship and high\r\nconsideration and respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [16] Venice and Genoa.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM SHORT.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, October 3, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--* * * * *\r\n\r\nI trusted to Mr. Dawson to give you a full explanation, verbally, on\r\na subject which I find he has but slightly mentioned to you. I shall\r\ntherefore now do it. When I returned from France, after an absence of six\r\nor seven years, I was astonished at the change which I found had taken\r\nplace in the United States in that time. No more like the same people;\r\ntheir notions, their habits and manners, the course of their commerce, so\r\ntotally changed, that I, who stood in those of 1784, found myself not at\r\nall qualified to speak their sentiments, or forward their views in 1790.\r\nVery soon, therefore, after entering on the office of Secretary of State,\r\nI recommended to General Washington to establish as a rule of practice,\r\nthat no person should be continued on foreign mission beyond an absence\r\nof six, seven, or eight years. He approved it. On the only subsequent\r\nmissions which took place in my time, the persons appointed were notified\r\nthat they could not be continued beyond that period. All returned within\r\nit except Humphreys. His term was not quite out when General Washington\r\nwent out of office. The succeeding administration had no rule for\r\nanything; so he continued. Immediately on my coming to the administration,\r\nI wrote to him myself, reminded him of the rule I had communicated to him\r\non his departure; that he had then been absent about eleven years, and\r\nconsequently must return. On this ground solely he was superseded. Under\r\nthese circumstances, your appointment was impossible after an absence of\r\nseventeen years. Under any others, I should never fail to give to yourself\r\nand the world proofs of my friendship for you, and of my confidence in\r\nyou. Whenever you shall return, you will be sensible in a greater, of what\r\nI was in a smaller degree, of the change in this nation from what it was\r\nwhen we both left it in 1784. We return like foreigners, and, like them,\r\nrequire a considerable residence here to become Americanized.\r\n\r\nThe state of political opinions continues to return steadily towards\r\nrepublicanism. To judge from the opposition papers, a stranger would\r\nsuppose that a considerable check to it had been produced by certain\r\nremovals of public officers. But this is not the case. All offices were\r\nin the hands of the federalists. The injustice of having totally excluded\r\nrepublicans was acknowledged by every man. To have removed one half, and\r\nto have placed republicans in their stead, would have been rigorously\r\njust, when it was known that these composed a very great majority of the\r\nnation. Yet such was their moderation in most of the States, that they\r\ndid not desire it. In these, therefore, no removals took place but for\r\nmalversation. In the middle States the contention had been higher, spirits\r\nwere more sharpened and less accommodating. It was necessary in these to\r\npractise a different treatment, and to make a few changes to tranquillize\r\nthe injured party. A few have been made there, a very few still remain to\r\nbe made. When this painful operation shall be over, I see nothing else\r\nahead of us which can give uneasiness to any of our citizens, or retard\r\nthat consolidation of sentiment so essential to our happiness and our\r\nstrength. The tory papers will still find fault with everything. But these\r\npapers are sinking daily, from their dissonance with the sentiments of\r\ntheir subscribers, and very few will shortly remain to keep up a solitary\r\nand ineffectual barking.\r\n\r\nThere is no point in which an American, long absent from his country,\r\nwanders so widely from its sentiments as on the subject of its foreign\r\naffairs. We have a perfect horror at everything like connecting ourselves\r\nwith the politics of Europe. It would indeed be advantageous to us to\r\nhave neutral rights established on a broad ground; but no dependence can\r\nbe placed in any European coalition for that. They have so many other\r\nbye-interests of greater weight, that some one or other will always be\r\nbought off. To be entangled with them would be a much greater evil than\r\na temporary acquiescence in the false principles which have prevailed.\r\nPeace is our most important interest, and a recovery from debt. We\r\nfeel ourselves strong, and daily growing stronger. The census just now\r\nconcluded, shows we have added to our population a third of what it was\r\nten years ago. This will be a duplication in twenty-three or twenty-four\r\nyears. If we can delay but for a few years the necessity of vindicating\r\nthe laws of nature on the ocean, we shall be the more sure of doing it\r\nwith effect. The day is within my time as well as yours, when we may\r\nsay by what laws other nations shall treat us on the sea. And we will\r\nsay it. In the meantime, we wish to let every treaty we have drop off\r\nwithout renewal. We call in our diplomatic missions, barely keeping up\r\nthose to the most important nations. There is a strong disposition in\r\nour countrymen to discontinue even these; and very possibly it may be\r\ndone. Consuls will be continued as usual. The interest which European\r\nnations feel, as well as ourselves, in the mutual patronage of commercial\r\nintercourse, is a sufficient stimulus on both sides to insure that\r\npatronage. A treaty, contrary to that interest, renders war necessary to\r\nget rid of it.\r\n\r\nI send this by Chancellor Livingston, named to the Senate the day after I\r\ncame into office, as our Minister Plenipotentiary to France. I have taken\r\ncare to impress him with the value of your society. You will find him an\r\namiable and honorable man; unfortunately, so deaf that he will have to\r\ntransact all his business by writing. You will have known long ago that\r\nMr. Skipworth is reinstated in his consulship, as well as some others who\r\nhad been set aside. I recollect no domestic news interesting to you. Your\r\nletters to your brother have been regularly transmitted, and I lately\r\nforwarded one from him, to be carried you by Mr. Livingston.\r\n\r\nPresent my best respects to our amiable and mutual friend, and accept\r\nyourself assurances of my sincere and constant affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCULAR TO THE HEADS OF THE DEPARTMENTS, AND PRIVATE.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, November 6, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Coming all of us into executive office, new, and unfamiliar\r\nwith the course of business previously practised, it was not to be\r\nexpected we should, in the first outset, adopt in every part a line of\r\nproceeding so perfect as to admit no amendment. The mode and degrees\r\nof communication, particularly between the President and heads of\r\ndepartments, have not been practised exactly on the same scale in all of\r\nthem. Yet it would certainly be more safe and satisfactory for ourselves\r\nas well as the public, that not only the best, but also an uniform course\r\nof proceeding as to manner and degree, should be observed. Having been\r\na member of the first administration under General Washington, I can\r\nstate with exactness what our course then was. Letters of business came\r\naddressed sometimes to the President, but most frequently to the heads\r\nof departments. If addressed to himself, he referred them to the proper\r\ndepartment to be acted on: if to one of the secretaries, the letter, if\r\nit required no answer, was communicated to the President, simply for his\r\ninformation. If an answer was requisite, the secretary of the department\r\ncommunicated the letter and his proposed answer to the President.\r\nGenerally they were simply sent back after perusal, which signified his\r\napprobation. Sometimes he returned them with an informal note, suggesting\r\nan alteration or a query. If a doubt of any importance arose, he reserved\r\nit for conference. By this means, he was always in accurate possession of\r\nall facts and proceedings in every part of the Union, and to whatsoever\r\ndepartment they related; he formed a central point for the different\r\nbranches; preserved an unity of object and action among them; exercised\r\nthat participation in the suggestion of affairs which his office made\r\nincumbent on him; and met himself the due responsibility for whatever\r\nwas done. During Mr. Adams' administration, his long and habitual\r\nabsences from the seat of government, rendered this kind of communication\r\nimpracticable, removed him from any share in the transaction of affairs,\r\nand parceled out the government, in fact, among four independent heads,\r\ndrawing sometimes in opposite directions. That the former is preferable\r\nto the latter course, cannot be doubted. It gave, indeed, to the heads of\r\ndepartments the trouble of making up, once a day, a packet of all their\r\ncommunications for the perusal of the President; it commonly also retarded\r\none day their despatches by mail. But in pressing cases, this injury\r\nwas prevented by presenting that case singly for immediate attention;\r\nand it produced us in return the benefit of his sanction for every act\r\nwe did. Whether any change of circumstances may render a change in this\r\nprocedure necessary, a little experience will show us. But I cannot\r\nwithhold recommending to heads of departments, that we should adopt this\r\ncourse for the present, leaving any necessary modifications of it to time\r\nand trial. I am sure my conduct must have proved, better than a thousand\r\ndeclarations would, that my confidence in those whom I am so happy as\r\nto have associated with me, is unlimited, unqualified and unabated. I am\r\nwell satisfied that everything goes on with a wisdom and rectitude which\r\nI could not improve. If I had the universe to choose from, I could not\r\nchange one of my associates to my better satisfaction. My sole motives\r\nare those before expressed, as governing the first administration in\r\nchalking out the rules of their proceeding; adding to them only a sense of\r\nobligation imposed on me by the public will, to meet personally the duties\r\nto which they have appointed me. If this mode of proceeding shall meet the\r\napprobation of the heads of departments, it may go into execution without\r\ngiving them the trouble of an answer; if any other can be suggested\r\nwhich would answer our views and add less to their labors, that will be\r\na sufficient reason for my preferring it to my own proposition, to the\r\nsubstance of which only, and not the form, I attach any importance.\r\n\r\nAccept for yourself particularly, my dear Sir, assurances of my constant\r\nand sincere affection and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO AMOS MARSH, ESQUIRE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 20, 1801.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I receive with great satisfaction the address you have been pleased\r\nto enclose me from the House of Representatives, of the freemen of the\r\nState of Vermont. The friendly and favorable sentiments they are so\r\ngood as to express towards myself personally, are high encouragement to\r\nperseverance in duty, and call for my sincere thanks.\r\n\r\nWith them I join cordially in admiring and revering the Constitution of\r\nthe United States,--the result of the collected wisdom of our country.\r\nThat wisdom has committed to us the important task of proving by example\r\nthat a government, if organized in all its parts on the Representative\r\nprinciple, unadulterated by the infusion of spurious elements, if founded,\r\nnot in the fears and follies of man, but on his reason, on his sense of\r\nright, on the predominance of the social over his dissocial passions, may\r\nbe so free as to restrain him in no moral right, and so firm as to protect\r\nhim from every moral wrong. To observe our fellow citizens gathering\r\ndaily under the banners of this faith, devoting their powers to its\r\nestablishment, and strengthening with their confidence the instruments of\r\ntheir selection, cannot but give new animation to the zeal of those who,\r\nsteadfast in the same belief, have seen no other object worthy the labors\r\nand losses we have all encountered.\r\n\r\nTo draw around the whole nation the strength of the general government, as\r\na barrier against foreign foes, to watch the borders of every State, that\r\nno external hand may intrude, or disturb the exercise of self-government\r\nreserved to itself, to equalize and moderate the public contributions,\r\nthat while the requisite services are invited by due remuneration, nothing\r\nbeyond this may exist to attract the attention of our citizens from the\r\npursuits of useful industry, nor unjustly to burthen those who continue\r\nin those pursuits--these are functions of the general government on which\r\nyou have a right to call. They are in unison with those principles which\r\nhave met the approbation of the Representatives of Vermont, as announced\r\nby myself on the former and recent occasions alluded to. These shall\r\nbe faithfully pursued according to the plain and candid import of the\r\nexpressions in which they were announced. No longer than they are so, will\r\nI ask that support which, through you, has been so respectfully tendered\r\nme. And I join in addressing Him, whose Kingdom ruleth over all, to direct\r\nthe administration of their affairs to their own greatest good.\r\n\r\nPraying you to be the channel of communicating these sentiments to the\r\nHouse of Representatives of the freemen of the State of Vermont, I beseech\r\nyou to accept for yourself personally, as well as for them, the homage of\r\nmy high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 24, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had not been unmindful of your letter of June 15th, covering\r\na resolution of the House of Representatives of Virginia, and referred\r\nto in yours of the 17th inst. The importance of the subject, and the\r\nbelief that it gave us time for consideration till the next meeting of\r\nthe Legislature, have induced me to defer the answer to this date. You\r\nwill perceive that some circumstances connected with the subject, and\r\nnecessarily presenting themselves to view, would be improper but for\r\nyours' and the legislative ear. Their publication might have an ill effect\r\nin more than one quarter. In confidence of attention to this, I shall\r\nindulge greater freedom in writing.\r\n\r\nCommon malefactors, I presume, make no part of the object of that\r\nresolution. Neither their numbers, nor the nature of their offences, seem\r\nto require any provisions beyond those practised heretofore, and found\r\nadequate to the repression of ordinary crimes. Conspiracy, insurgency,\r\ntreason, rebellion, (among that description of persons who brought on us\r\nthe alarm, and on themselves the tragedy, of 1800,) were doubtless within\r\nthe view of every one; but many perhaps contemplated, and one expression\r\nof the resolution might comprehend, a much larger scope. Respect to both\r\nopinions makes it my duty to understand the resolution in all the extent\r\nof which it is susceptible.\r\n\r\nThe idea seems to be to provide for these people by a purchase of lands;\r\nand it is asked whether such a purchase can be made of the United States\r\nin their western territory? A very great extent of country, north of the\r\nOhio, has been laid off into townships, and is now at market, according\r\nto the provisions of the acts of Congress, with which you are acquainted.\r\nThere is nothing which would restrain the State of Virginia either in\r\nthe purchase or the application of these lands; but a purchase, by the\r\nacre, might perhaps be a more expensive provision than the House of\r\nRepresentatives contemplated. Questions would also arise whether the\r\nestablishment of such a colony within our limits, and to become a part of\r\nour union, would be desirable to the State of Virginia itself, or to the\r\nother States--especially those who would be in its vicinity?\r\n\r\nCould we procure lands beyond the limits of the United States to form a\r\nreceptacle for these people? On our northern boundary, the country not\r\noccupied by British subjects, is the property of Indian nations, whose\r\ntitle would be to be extinguished, with the consent of Great Britain; and\r\nthe new settlers would be British subjects. It is hardly to be believed\r\nthat either Great Britain or the Indian proprietors have so disinterested\r\na regard for us, as to be willing to relieve us, by receiving such a\r\ncolony themselves; and as much to be doubted whether that race of men\r\ncould long exist in so rigorous a climate. On our western and southern\r\nfrontiers, Spain holds an immense country, the occupancy of which,\r\nhowever, is in the Indian natives, except a few insulated spots possessed\r\nby Spanish subjects. It is very questionable, indeed, whether the Indians\r\nwould sell? whether Spain would be willing to receive these people? and\r\nnearly certain that she would not alienate the sovereignty. The same\r\nquestion to ourselves would recur here also, as did in the first case:\r\nshould we be willing to have such a colony in contact with us? However our\r\npresent interests may restrain us within our own limits, it is impossible\r\nnot to look forward to distant times, when our rapid multiplication will\r\nexpand itself beyond those limits, and cover the whole northern, if not\r\nthe southern continent, with a people speaking the same language, governed\r\nin similar forms, and by similar laws; nor can we contemplate with\r\nsatisfaction either blot or mixture on that surface. Spain, France, and\r\nPortugal hold possessions on the southern continent, as to which I am not\r\nwell enough informed to say how far they might meet our views. But either\r\nthere or in the northern continent, should the constituted authorities of\r\nVirginia fix their attention, of preference, I will have the dispositions\r\nof those powers sounded in the first instance.\r\n\r\nThe West Indies offer a more probable and practicable retreat for them.\r\nInhabited already by a people of their own race and color; climates\r\ncongenial with their natural constitution; insulated from the other\r\ndescriptions of men; nature seems to have formed these islands to become\r\nthe receptacle of the blacks transplanted into this hemisphere. Whether\r\nwe could obtain from the European sovereigns of those islands leave to\r\nsend thither the persons under consideration, I cannot say; but I think\r\nit more probable than the former propositions, because of their being\r\nalready inhabited more or less by the same race. The most promising\r\nportion of them is the island of St. Domingo, where the blacks are\r\nestablished into a sovereignty _de facto_, and have organized themselves\r\nunder regular laws and government. I should conjecture that their present\r\nruler might be willing, on many considerations, to receive over that\r\ndescription which would be exiled for acts deemed criminal by us, but\r\nmeritorious, perhaps, by him. The possibility that these exiles might\r\nstimulate and conduct vindicative or predatory descents on our coasts, and\r\nfacilitate concert with their brethren remaining here, looks to a state\r\nof things between that island and us not probable on a contemplation of\r\nour relative strength, and of the disproportion daily growing; and it is\r\noverweighed by the humanity of the measures proposed, and the advantages\r\nof disembarrassing ourselves of such dangerous characters. Africa would\r\noffer a last and undoubted resort, if all others more desirable should\r\nfail us. Whenever the Legislature of Virginia shall have brought its\r\nmind to a point, so that I may know exactly what to propose to foreign\r\nauthorities, I will execute their wishes with fidelity and zeal. I hope,\r\nhowever, they will pardon me for suggesting a single question for their\r\nown consideration. When we contemplate the variety of countries and of\r\nsovereigns towards which we may direct our views, the vast revolutions\r\nand changes of circumstances which are now in a course of progression,\r\nthe possibilities that arrangements now to be made, with a view to any\r\nparticular plea, may, at no great distance of time, be totally deranged by\r\na change of sovereignty, of government, or of other circumstances, it will\r\nbe for the Legislature to consider whether, after they shall have made\r\nall those general provisions which may be fixed by legislative authority,\r\nit would be reposing too much confidence in their Executive to leave the\r\nplace of relegation to be decided on by _them_. They could accommodate\r\ntheir arrangements to the actual state of things, in which countries or\r\npowers may be found to exist at the day; and may prevent the effect of the\r\nlaw from being defeated by intervening changes. This, however, is for them\r\nto decide. Our duty will be to respect their decision.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant affection, and high consideration and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE REVEREND ISAAC STORY.\r\n\r\n                                            WASHINGTON, December 5th, 1801.\r\n\r\nSIR,--Your favor of October 27 was received some time since, and read with\r\npleasure. It is not for me to pronounce on the hypothesis you present\r\nof a transmigration of souls from one body to another in certain cases.\r\nThe laws of nature have withheld from us the means of physical knowledge\r\nof the country of spirits, and revelation has, for reasons unknown to\r\nus, chosen to leave us in the dark as we were. When I was young I was\r\nfond of the speculations which seemed to promise some insight into that\r\nhidden country, but observing at length that they left me in the same\r\nignorance in which they had found me, I have for very many years ceased\r\nto read or to think concerning them, and have reposed my head on that\r\npillow of ignorance which a benevolent Creator has made so soft for us,\r\nknowing how much we should be forced to use it. I have thought it better,\r\nby nourishing the good passions and controlling the bad, to merit an\r\ninheritance in a state of being of which I can know so little, and to\r\ntrust for the future to Him who has been so good for the past. I perceive\r\ntoo that these speculations have with you been only the amusement of\r\nleisure hours; while your labors have been devoted to the education of\r\nyour children, making them good members of society, to the instructing\r\nmen in their duties, and performing the other offices of a large parish.\r\nI am happy in your approbation of the principles I avowed on entering on\r\nthe government. Ingenious minds, availing themselves of the imperfection\r\nof language, have tortured the expressions out of their plain meaning\r\nin order to infer departures from them in practice. If revealed language\r\nhas not been able to guard itself against misinterpretations, I could not\r\nexpect it. But if an administration quadrating with the obvious import\r\nof my language can conciliate the affections of my opposers, I will merit\r\nthat conciliation. I pray you to accept assurances of my respect and best\r\nwishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO PRESIDENT OF THE SENATE.\r\n\r\n                                                         December, 8, 1801.\r\n\r\nSIR,--The circumstances under which we find ourselves at this place\r\nrendering inconvenient the mode heretofore practised of making, by\r\npersonal address, the first communications between the legislative and\r\nexecutive branches, I have adopted that by message, as used on all\r\nsubsequent occasions through the session. In doing this, I have had\r\nprincipal regard to the convenience of the Legislature, to the economy\r\nof their time, to their relief from the embarrassment of immediate\r\nanswers, on subjects not yet fully before them, and to the benefits thence\r\nresulting to the public affairs. Trusting that a procedure, founded on\r\nthese motives, will meet their approbation, I beg leave through you, Sir,\r\nto communicate the enclosed copy, with the documents accompanying it, to\r\nthe honorable the Senate, and pray you to accept for yourself and them,\r\nthe homage of my high regard and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN DICKINSON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 19, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The approbation of my ancient friends is, above all things,\r\nthe most grateful to my heart. They know for what objects we relinquished\r\nthe delights of domestic society, tranquillity and science, and committed\r\nourselves to the ocean of revolution, to wear out the only life God has\r\ngiven us here in scenes the benefits of which will accrue only to those\r\nwho follow us. Surely we had in view to obtain the theory and practice\r\nof good government; and how any, who seemed so ardent in this pursuit,\r\ncould as shamelessly have apostatized, and supposed we meant only to\r\nput our government into other hands, but not other forms, is indeed\r\nwonderful. The lesson we have had will probably be useful to the people\r\nat large, by showing to them how capable they are of being made the\r\ninstruments of their own bondage. A little more prudence and moderation\r\nin those who had mounted themselves on their fears, and it would have\r\nbeen long and difficult to unhorse them. Their madness had done in three\r\nyears what reason alone, acting against them, would not have effected in\r\nmany; and the more, as they might have gone on forming new entrenchments\r\nfor themselves from year to year. My great anxiety at present is, to\r\navail ourselves of our ascendancy to establish good principles and good\r\npractices; to fortify republicanism behind as many barriers as possible,\r\nthat the outworks may give time to rally and save the citadel, should that\r\nbe again in danger. On their part, they have retired into the judiciary as\r\na stronghold. There the remains of federalism are to be preserved and fed\r\nfrom the treasury, and from that battery all the works of republicanism\r\nare to be beaten down and erased. By a fraudulent use of the Constitution,\r\nwhich has made judges irremovable, they have multiplied useless judges\r\nmerely to strengthen their phalanx.\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps have been alarmed, as some have been, at the proposition\r\nto abolish the whole of the internal taxes. But it is perfectly safe.\r\nThey are under a million of dollars, and we can economize the government\r\ntwo or three millions a year. The impost alone gives us ten or eleven\r\nmillions annually, increasing at a compound ratio of six and two-thirds\r\nper cent. per annum, and consequently doubling in ten years. But leaving\r\nthat increase for contingencies, the present amount will support the\r\ngovernment, pay the interest of the public debt, and discharge the\r\nprincipal in fifteen years. If the increase proceeds, and no contingencies\r\ndemand it, it will pay off the principal in a shorter time. Exactly one\r\nhalf of the public debt, to wit, thirty-seven millions of dollars, is\r\nowned in the United States. That capital, then, will be set afloat, to\r\nbe employed in rescuing our commerce from the hands of foreigners, or in\r\nagriculture, canals, bridges, or other useful enterprises. By suppressing\r\nat once the whole internal taxes, we abolish three-fourths of the offices\r\nnow existing, and spread over the land. Seeing the interest you take in\r\nthe public affairs, I have indulged myself in observations flowing from\r\na sincere and ardent desire of seeing our affairs put into an honest and\r\nadvantageous train. Accept assurances of my constant and affectionate\r\nesteem and high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 20, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have received your favor of November 27, with your\r\nintroductory lecture, which I have read with the pleasure and edification\r\nI do everything from you. I am happy to see that vaccination is\r\nintroduced, and likely to be kept up, in Philadelphia; but I shall not\r\nthink it exhibits all its utility until experience shall have hit upon\r\nsome mark or rule by which the popular eye may distinguish genuine from\r\nspurious virus. It was with this view that I wished to discover whether\r\ntime could not be made the standard, and supposed, from the little\r\nexperience I had, that matter, taken at eight times twenty-four hours from\r\nthe time of insertion, could always be in the proper state. As far as I\r\nwent I found it so; but I shall be happy to learn what the immense field\r\nof experience in Philadelphia will teach us on that subject.\r\n\r\nOur winter campaign has opened with more good humor than I expected.\r\nBy sending a message, instead of making a speech at the opening of the\r\nsession, I have prevented the bloody conflict to which the making an\r\nanswer would have committed them. They consequently were able to set into\r\nreal business at once, without losing ten or twelve days in combating\r\nan answer. Hitherto there has been no disagreeable altercations. The\r\nsuppression of useless offices, and lopping off the parasitical plant\r\nengrafted at the last session on the judiciary body, will probably produce\r\nsome. Bitter men are not pleased with the suppression of taxes. Not daring\r\nto condemn the measure, they attack the motive; and too disingenuous to\r\nascribe it to the honest one of freeing our citizens from unnecessary\r\nburthens and unnecessary systems of office, they ascribe it to a desire\r\nof popularity. But every honest man will suppose honest acts to flow from\r\nhonest principles, and the rogues may rail without intermission.\r\n\r\nMy health has been always so uniformly firm, that I have for some years\r\ndreaded nothing so much as the living too long. I think, however, that\r\na flaw has appeared which ensures me against that, without cutting short\r\nany of the period during which I could expect to remain capable of being\r\nuseful. It will probably give me as many years as I wish, and without pain\r\nor debility. Should this be the case, my most anxious prayers will have\r\nbeen fulfilled by Heaven.\r\n\r\nI have said as much to no mortal breathing, and my florid health is\r\ncalculated to keep my friends as well as foes quiet, as they should be.\r\nAccept assurances of my constant esteem and high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n                                                           January 1, 1802.\r\n\r\nAverse to receive addresses, yet unable to prevent them, I have generally\r\nendeavored to turn them to some account, by making them the occasion, by\r\nway of answer, of sowing useful truths and principles among the people,\r\nwhich might germinate and become rooted among their political tenets. The\r\nBaptist address, now enclosed, admits of a condemnation of the alliance\r\nbetween Church and State, under the authority of the Constitution. It\r\nfurnishes an occasion, too, which I have long wished to find, of saying\r\nwhy I do not proclaim fastings and thanksgivings, as my predecessors did.\r\nThe address, to be sure, does not point at this, and its introduction\r\nis awkward. But I foresee no opportunity of doing it more pertinently.\r\nI know it will give great offence to the New England clergy; but the\r\nadvocate of religious freedom is to expect neither peace nor forgiveness\r\nfrom them. Will you be so good as to examine the answer, and suggest any\r\nalterations which might prevent an ill effect, or promote a good one,\r\namong the people? You understand the temper of those in the North, and can\r\nweaken it, therefore, to their stomachs: it is at present seasoned to the\r\nSouthern taste only. I would ask the favor of you to return it, with the\r\naddress, in the course of the day or evening. Health and affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, April 1, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have read and considered your report on the operations of the\r\nsinking fund, and entirely approve of it, as the best plan on which we can\r\nset out. I think it an object of great importance, to be kept in view and\r\nto be undertaken at a fit season, to simplify our system of finance, and\r\nbring it within the comprehension of every member of Congress. Hamilton\r\nset out on a different plan. In order that he might have the entire\r\ngovernment of his machine, he determined so to complicate it as that\r\nneither the President or Congress should be able to understand it, or to\r\ncontrol him. He succeeded in doing this, not only beyond their reach, but\r\nso that he at length could not unravel it himself. He gave to the debt,\r\nin the first instance, in funding it, the most artificial and mysterious\r\nform he could devise. He then moulded up his appropriations of a number of\r\nscraps and remnants, many of which were nothing at all, and applied them\r\nto different objects in reversion and remainder, until the whole system\r\nwas involved in impenetrable fog; and while he was giving himself the airs\r\nof providing for the payment of the debt, he left himself free to add to\r\nit continually, as he did in fact, instead of paying it. I like your idea\r\nof kneading all his little scraps and fragments into one batch, and adding\r\nto it a complementary sum, which, while it forms it into a single mass\r\nfrom which everything is to be paid, will enable us, should a breach of\r\nappropriation ever be charged on us, to prove that the sum appropriated,\r\nand more, has been applied to its specific object.\r\n\r\nBut there is a point beyond this on which I should wish to keep my\r\neye, and to which I should aim to approach by every tack which previous\r\narrangements force on us. That is, to form into one consolidated mass all\r\nthe moneys received into the treasury, and to the several expenditures,\r\ngiving them a preference of payment according to the order in which\r\nthey should be arranged. As for example. 1. The interest of the public\r\ndebt. 2. Such portion of principal as are exigible. 3. The expenses of\r\ngovernment. 4. Such other portions of principal as, though not exigible,\r\nwe are still free to pay when we please. The last object might be made\r\nto take up the residuum of money remaining in the treasury at the end of\r\nevery year, after the three first objects were complied with, and would be\r\nthe barometer whereby to test the economy of the administration. It would\r\nfurnish a simple measure by which every one could mete their merit, and by\r\nwhich every one could decide when taxes were deficient or superabundant.\r\nIf to this can be added a simplification of the form of accounts in the\r\ntreasury department, and in the organization of its officers, so as to\r\nbring everything to a single centre, we might hope to see the finances\r\nof the Union as clear and intelligible as a merchant's books, so that\r\nevery member of Congress, and every man of any mind in the Union, should\r\nbe able to comprehend them, to investigate abuses, and consequently to\r\ncontrol them. Our predecessors have endeavored by intricacies of system,\r\nand shuffling the investigator over from one officer to another, to cover\r\neverything from detection. I hope we shall go in the contrary direction,\r\nand that by our honest and judicious reformations, we may be able,\r\nwithin the limits of our time, to bring things back to that simple and\r\nintelligible system on which they should have been organized at first.\r\n\r\nI have suggested only a single alteration in the report, which is merely\r\nverbal and of no consequence. We shall now get rid of the commissioner\r\nof the internal revenue, and superintendent of stamps. It remains to\r\namalgamate the comptroller and auditor into one, and reduce the register\r\nto a clerk of accounts; and then the organization will consist, as it\r\nshould at first, of a keeper of money, a keeper of accounts, and the\r\nhead of the department. This constellation of great men in the treasury\r\ndepartment was of a piece with the rest of Hamilton's plans. He took his\r\nown stand as a Lieutenant General, surrounded by his Major Generals, and\r\nstationing his Brigadiers and Colonels under the name of Supervisors,\r\nInspectors, &c., in the different States. Let us deserve well of our\r\ncountry by making her interests the end of all our plans, and not our\r\nown pomp, patronage and irresponsibility. I have hazarded these hasty\r\nand crude ideas, which occurred on contemplating your report. They may be\r\nthe subject of future conversation and correction. Accept my affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL KOSCIUSKO.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, April 2, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--It is but lately that I have received your letter of the\r\n25th Frimaire (December 15) wishing to know whether some officers of your\r\ncountry could expect to be employed in this country. To prevent a suspense\r\ninjurious to them, I hasten to inform you, that we are now actually\r\nengaged in reducing our military establishment one-third, and discharging\r\none-third of our officers. We keep in service no more than men enough to\r\ngarrison the small posts dispersed at great distances on our frontiers,\r\nwhich garrisons will generally consist of a captain's company only,\r\nand in no cases of more than two or three, in not one, of a sufficient\r\nnumber to require a field officer; and no circumstance whatever can bring\r\nthese garrisons together, because it would be an abandonment of their\r\nforts. Thus circumstanced, you will perceive the entire impossibility of\r\nproviding for the persons you recommend. I wish it had been in my power\r\nto give you a more favorable answer; but next to the fulfilling your\r\nwishes, the most grateful thing I can do is to give a faithful answer. The\r\nsession of the first Congress convened since republicanism has recovered\r\nits ascendancy, is now drawing to a close. They will pretty completely\r\nfulfil all the desires of the people. They have reduced the army and\r\nnavy to what is barely necessary. They are disarming executive patronage\r\nand preponderance, by putting down one-half the offices of the United\r\nStates, which are no longer necessary. These economies have enabled them\r\nto suppress all the internal taxes, and still to make such provision for\r\nthe payment of their public debt as to discharge that in eighteen years.\r\nThey have lopped off a parasite limb, planted by their predecessors on\r\ntheir judiciary body for party purposes; they are opening the doors of\r\nhospitality to fugitives from the oppressions of other countries; and\r\nwe have suppressed all those public forms and ceremonies which tended\r\nto familiarize the public eye to the harbingers of another form of\r\ngovernment. The people are nearly all united; their quondam leaders,\r\ninfuriated with the sense of their impotence, will soon be seen or heard\r\nonly in the newspapers, which serve as chimneys to carry off noxious\r\nvapors and smoke, and all is now tranquil, firm and well, as it should\r\nbe. I add no signature because unnecessary for you. God bless you, and\r\npreserve you still for a season of usefulness to your country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 18, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A favorable and confidential opportunity offering by M. Dupont\r\nde Nemours, who is revisiting his native country, gives me an opportunity\r\nof sending you a cypher to be used between us, which will give you some\r\ntrouble to understand, but once understood, is the easiest to use, the\r\nmost indecypherable, and varied by a new key with the greatest facility,\r\nof any I have ever known. I am in hopes the explanation enclosed will be\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut writing by Mr. Dupont, I need use no cypher. I require from him to put\r\nthis into your own and no other hand, let the delay occasioned by that be\r\nwhat it will.\r\n\r\nThe cession of Louisiana and the Floridas by Spain to France, works most\r\nsorely on the United States. On this subject the Secretary of State has\r\nwritten to you fully, yet I cannot forbear recurring to it personally,\r\nso deep is the impression it makes on my mind. It completely reverses all\r\nthe political relations of the United States, and will form a new epoch in\r\nour political course. Of all nations of any consideration, France is the\r\none which, hitherto, has offered the fewest points on which we could have\r\nany conflict of right, and the most points of a communion of interests.\r\nFrom these causes, we have ever looked to her as our _natural friend_, as\r\none with which we never could have an occasion of difference. Her growth,\r\ntherefore, we viewed as our own, her misfortunes ours. There is on the\r\nglobe one single spot, the possessor of which is our natural and habitual\r\nenemy. It is New Orleans, through which the produce of three-eighths of\r\nour territory must pass to market, and from its fertility it will ere long\r\nyield more than half of our whole produce, and contain more than half of\r\nour inhabitants. France, placing herself in that door, assumes to us the\r\nattitude of defiance. Spain might have retained it quietly for years. Her\r\npacific dispositions, her feeble state, would induce her to increase our\r\nfacilities there, so that her possession of the place would be hardly felt\r\nby us, and it would not, perhaps, be very long before some circumstance\r\nmight arise, which might make the cession of it to us the price of\r\nsomething of more worth to her. Not so can it ever be in the hands of\r\nFrance: the impetuosity of her temper, the energy and restlessness of\r\nher character, placed in a point of eternal friction with us, and our\r\ncharacter, which, though quiet and loving peace and the pursuit of wealth,\r\nis high-minded, despising wealth in competition with insult or injury,\r\nenterprising and energetic as any nation on earth; these circumstances\r\nrender it impossible that France and the United States can continue long\r\nfriends, when they meet in so irritable a position. They, as well as we,\r\nmust be blind if they do not see this; and we must be very improvident\r\nif we do not begin to make arrangements on that hypothesis. The day that\r\nFrance takes possession of New Orleans, fixes the sentence which is to\r\nrestrain her forever within her low-water mark. It seals the union of two\r\nnations, who, in conjunction, can maintain exclusive possession of the\r\nocean. From that moment, we must marry ourselves to the British fleet and\r\nnation. We must turn all our attention to a maritime force, for which our\r\nresources place us on very high ground; and having formed and connected\r\ntogether a power which may render reinforcement of her settlements here\r\nimpossible to France, make the first cannon which shall be fired in Europe\r\nthe signal for the tearing up any settlement she may have made, and for\r\nholding the two continents of America in sequestration for the common\r\npurposes of the United British and American nations. This is not a state\r\nof things we seek or desire. It is one which this measure, if adopted by\r\nFrance, forces on us as necessarily, as any other cause, by the laws of\r\nnature, brings on its necessary effect. It is not from a fear of France\r\nthat we deprecate this measure proposed by her. For however greater her\r\nforce is than ours, compared in the abstract, it is nothing in comparison\r\nof ours, when to be exerted on our soil. But it is from a sincere love of\r\npeace, and a firm persuasion, that bound to France by the interests and\r\nthe strong sympathies still existing in the minds of our citizens, and\r\nholding relative positions which insure their continuance, we are secure\r\nof a long course of peace. Whereas, the change of friends, which will be\r\nrendered necessary if France changes that position, embarks us necessarily\r\nas a belligerent power in the first war of Europe. In that case, France\r\nwill have held possession of New Orleans during the interval of a peace,\r\nlong or short, at the end of which it will be wrested from her. Will this\r\nshort-lived possession have been an equivalent to her for the transfer\r\nof such a weight into the scale of her enemy? Will not the amalgamation\r\nof a young, thriving nation, continue to that enemy the health and force\r\nwhich are at present so evidently on the decline? And will a few years'\r\npossession of New Orleans add equally to the strength of France? She may\r\nsay she needs Louisiana for the supply of her West Indies. She does not\r\nneed it in time of peace, and in war she could not depend on them, because\r\nthey would be so easily intercepted. I should suppose that all these\r\nconsiderations might, in some proper form, be brought into view of the\r\ngovernment of France. Though stated by us, it ought not to give offence;\r\nbecause we do not bring them forward as a menace, but as consequences\r\nnot controllable by us, but inevitable from the course of things. We\r\nmention them, not as things which we desire by any means, but as things we\r\ndeprecate; and we beseech a friend to look forward and to prevent them for\r\nour common interest.\r\n\r\nIf France considers Louisiana, however, as indispensable for her views,\r\nshe might perhaps be willing to look about for arrangements which might\r\nreconcile it to our interests. If anything could do this, it would be\r\nthe ceding to us the island of New Orleans and the Floridas. This would\r\ncertainly, in a great degree, remove the causes of jarring and irritation\r\nbetween us, and perhaps for such a length of time, as might produce other\r\nmeans of making the measure permanently conciliatory to our interests\r\nand friendships. It would, at any rate, relieve us from the necessity\r\nof taking immediate measures for countervailing such an operation by\r\narrangements in another quarter. But still we should consider New Orleans\r\nand the Floridas as no equivalent for the risk of a quarrel with France,\r\nproduced by her vicinage.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt you have urged these considerations, on every proper\r\noccasion, with the government where you are. They are such as must have\r\neffect, if you can find means of producing thorough reflection on them by\r\nthat government. The idea here is, that the troops sent to St. Domingo,\r\nwere to proceed to Louisiana after finishing their work in that island. If\r\nthis were the arrangement, it will give you time to return again and again\r\nto the charge. For the conquest of St. Domingo will not be a short work.\r\nIt will take considerable time, and wear down a great number of soldiers.\r\nEvery eye in the United States is now fixed on the affairs of Louisiana.\r\nPerhaps nothing since the revolutionary war, has produced more uneasy\r\nsensations through the body of the nation. Notwithstanding temporary\r\nbickerings have taken place with France, she has still a strong hold on\r\nthe affections of our citizens generally. I have thought it not amiss,\r\nby way of supplement to the letters of the Secretary of State, to write\r\nyou this private one, to impress you with the importance we affix to this\r\ntransaction. I pray you to cherish Dupont. He has the best disposition for\r\nthe continuance of friendship between the two nations, and perhaps you may\r\nbe able to make a good use of him.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my affectionate esteem and high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 25, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The week being now closed, during which you had given me a hope\r\nof seeing you here, I think it safe to enclose you my letters for Paris,\r\nlest they should fail of the benefit of so desirable a conveyance. They\r\nare addressed to Kosciugha, Madame de Corny, Mrs. Short, and Chancellor\r\nLivingston. You will perceive the unlimited confidence I repose in your\r\ngood faith, and in your cordial dispositions to serve both countries, when\r\nyou observe that I leave the letters for Chancellor Livingston open for\r\nyour perusal. The first page respects a cypher, as do the loose sheets\r\nfolded with the letter. These are interesting to him and myself only, and\r\ntherefore are not for your perusal. It is the second, third, and fourth\r\npages which I wish you to read to possess yourself of completely, and\r\nthen seal the letter with wafers stuck under the flying seal, that it\r\nmay be seen by nobody else if any accident should happen to you. I wish\r\nyou to be possessed of the subject, because you may be able to impress\r\non the government of France the inevitable consequences of their taking\r\npossession of Louisiana; and though, as I here mention, the cession of\r\nNew Orleans and the Floridas to us would be a palliation, yet I believe it\r\nwould be no more, and that this measure will cost France, and perhaps not\r\nvery long hence, a war which will annihilate her on the ocean, and place\r\nthat element under the despotism of two nations, which I am not reconciled\r\nto the more because my own would be one of them. Add to this the exclusive\r\nappropriation of both continents of America as a consequence. I wish the\r\npresent order of things to continue, and with a view to this I value\r\nhighly a state of friendship between France and us. You know too well\r\nhow sincere I have ever been in these dispositions to doubt them. You\r\nknow, too, how much I value peace, and how unwillingly I should see any\r\nevent take place which would render war a necessary resource; and that\r\nall our movements should change their character and object. I am thus\r\nopen with you, because I trust that you will have it in your power to\r\nimpress on that government considerations, in the scale against which\r\nthe possession of Louisiana is nothing. In Europe, nothing but Europe\r\nis seen, or supposed to have any right in the affairs of nations; but\r\nthis little event, of France's possessing herself of Louisiana, which is\r\nthrown in as nothing, as a mere make-weight in the general settlement of\r\naccounts,--this speck which now appears as an almost invisible point in\r\nthe horizon, is the embryo of a tornado which will burst on the countries\r\non both sides of the Atlantic, and involve in its effects their highest\r\ndestinies. That it may yet be avoided is my sincere prayer; and if you can\r\nbe the means of informing the wisdom of Bonaparte of all its consequences,\r\nyou have deserved well of both countries. Peace and abstinence from\r\nEuropean interferences are our objects, and so will continue while the\r\npresent order of things in America remain uninterrupted. There is another\r\nservice you can render. I am told that Talleyrand is personally hostile\r\nto us. This, I suppose, has been occasioned by the X Y Z history. But\r\nhe should consider that that was the artifice of a party, willing to\r\nsacrifice him to the consolidation of their power. This nation has done\r\nhim justice by dismissing them; that those in power are precisely those\r\nwho disbelieved that story, and saw in it nothing but an attempt to\r\ndeceive our country; that we entertain towards him personally the most\r\nfriendly dispositions; that as to the government of France, we know too\r\nlittle of the state of things there to understand what it is, and have\r\nno inclination to meddle in their settlement. Whatever government they\r\nestablish, we wish to be well with it. One more request,--that you deliver\r\nthe letter to Chancellor Livingston with your own hands, and, moreover,\r\nthat you charge Madame Dupont, if any accident happen to you, that she\r\ndeliver the letter with her own hands. If it passes only through hers and\r\nyours, I shall have perfect confidence in its safety. Present her my most\r\nsincere respects, and accept yourself assurances of my constant affection,\r\nand my prayers, that a genial sky and propitious gales may place you,\r\nafter a pleasant voyage, in the midst of your friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BARLOW.\r\n\r\n                                                   WASHINGTON, May 3, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have doubted whether to write to you, because yours of\r\nAugust 25th, received only March 27th, gives me reason to expect you are\r\nnow on the ocean; however, as I know that voyages so important are often\r\ndelayed, I shall venture a line by Mr. Dupont de Nemours. The Legislature\r\nrises this day. They have carried into execution, steadily almost, all\r\nthe propositions submitted to them in my message at the opening of the\r\nsession. Some few are laid over for want of time. The most material is\r\nthe militia, the plan of which they cannot easily modify to their general\r\napprobation. Our majority in the House of Representatives has been about\r\ntwo to one; in the Senate, eighteen to fifteen. After another election it\r\nwill be of two to one in the Senate, and it would not be for the public\r\ngood to have it greater. A respectable minority is useful as censors. The\r\npresent one is not respectable, being the bitterest remains of the cup\r\nof federalism, rendered desperate and furious by despair. A small check\r\nin the tide of republicanism in Massachusetts, which has showed itself\r\nvery unexpectedly at the last election, is not accounted for. Everywhere\r\nelse we are becoming one. In Rhode Island the late election gives us\r\ntwo to one through the whole State. Vermont is decidedly with us. It is\r\nsaid and believed that New Hampshire has got a majority of republicans\r\nnow in its Legislature; and wanted a few hundreds only of turning out\r\ntheir federal Governor. He goes assuredly the next trial. Connecticut is\r\nsupposed to have gained for us about fifteen or twenty per cent. since\r\nthe last election; but the exact issue is not yet known here; nor is\r\nit certainly known how we shall stand in the House of Representatives\r\nof Massachusetts. In the Senate there we have lost ground. The candid\r\nfederalists acknowledge that their party can never more raise its head.\r\nThe operations of this session of Congress, when known among the people\r\nat large, will consolidate them. We shall now be so strong that we shall\r\ncertainly split again; for freemen, thinking differently and speaking and\r\nacting as they think, will form into classes of sentiment. But it must\r\nbe under another name. That of federalism is become so odious that no\r\nparty can rise under it. As the division into whig and tory is founded\r\nin the nature of man; the weakly and nerveless, the rich and the corrupt,\r\nseeing more safety and accessibility in a strong executive; the healthy,\r\nfirm, and virtuous, feeling a confidence in their physical and moral\r\nresources, and willing to part with only so much power as is necessary\r\nfor their good government; and, therefore, to retain the rest in the hands\r\nof the many, the division will substantially be into whig and tory, as in\r\nEngland formerly. As yet no symptoms show themselves, nor will, till after\r\nanother election. I am extremely happy to learn that you are so much at\r\nyour ease, that you can devote the rest of your life to the information\r\nof others. The choice of a place of residence is material. I do not\r\nthink you can do better than to fix here for awhile, till you can become\r\nagain Americanized, and understand the map of the country. This may be\r\nconsidered as a pleasant country residence, with a number of neat little\r\nvillages scattered around within the distance of a mile and a half, and\r\nfurnishing a plain and substantially good society. They have begun their\r\nbuildings in about four or five different points, at each of which there\r\nare buildings enough to be considered as a village. The whole population\r\nis about six thousand. Mr. Madison and myself have cut out a piece of work\r\nfor you, which is to write the history of the United States, from the\r\nclose of the war downwards. We are rich ourselves in materials, and can\r\nopen all the public archives to you; but your residence here is essential,\r\nbecause a great deal of the knowledge of things is not on paper, but only\r\nwithin ourselves, for verbal communication. John Marshall is writing the\r\nlife of General Washington from his papers. It is intended to come out\r\njust in time to influence the next presidential election. It is written,\r\ntherefore, principally with a view to electioneering purposes. But it\r\nwill consequently be out in time to aid you with information, as well as\r\nto point out the perversions of truth necessary to be rectified. Think of\r\nthis, and agree to it; and be assured of my high esteem and attachment.\r\n\r\nP. S. There is a most lovely seat adjoining this city, on a high hill,\r\ncommanding a most extensive view of the Potomac, now for sale. A superb\r\nhouse, gardens, &c., with thirty or forty acres of ground. It will be sold\r\nunder circumstances of distress, and will probably go for the half of what\r\nit has cost. It was built by Gustavus Scott, who is dead bankrupt.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                             June 19, 1802.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the bank of Pennsylvania, their difficulties proceed from\r\nexcessive discounts. The $3,000,000 due to them comprehend doubtless all\r\nthe desperate debts accumulated since their institution. Their buildings\r\nshould only be counted at the value of the naked ground belonging to them;\r\nbecause, if brought to market, they are worth to private builders no more\r\nthan their materials, which are known by experience to be worth no more\r\nthan the cost of pulling down and removing them. Their situation then is\r\n\r\n    They owe                            $2,200,000\r\n    They have of good money     $710,000\r\n                                 250,000\r\n    Ground worth perhaps           5,000   965,000\r\n                                         ---------\r\n                                        $1,235,000\r\n\r\nTo pay which $1,235,000, they depend on $3,000,000 of debts due to them,\r\nthe amount of which shows they are of long standing, a part desperate, a\r\npart not commandable. In this situation it does not seem safe to deposit\r\npublic money with them, and the effect would only be to enable them\r\nto nourish their disease by continuing their excessive discounts, the\r\nchecking of which is the only means of saving themselves from bankruptcy.\r\nThe getting them to pay the Dutch debt, is but a deposit in another though\r\na safer form. If we can with propriety recommend indulgence to the bank\r\nof the United States, it would be attended with the least danger to us\r\nof any of the measures suggested, but it is in fact asking that bank to\r\nlend to the one of Pennsylvania, that they may be enabled to continue\r\nlending to others. The monopoly of a single bank is certainly an evil.\r\nThe multiplication of them was intended to cure it; but it multiplied\r\nan influence of the same character with the first, and completed the\r\nsupplanting the precious metals by a paper circulation. Between such\r\nparties the less we meddle the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR PRIESTLEY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 19, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 12th has been duly received, and with that\r\npleasure which the approbation of the good and the wise must ever give.\r\nThe sentiments it impresses are far beyond my merits or pretensions; they\r\nare precious testimonies to me however, that my sincere desire to do\r\nwhat is right and just is viewed with candor. That it should be handed\r\nto the world under the authority of your name is securing its credit\r\nwith posterity. In the great work which has been effected in America, no\r\nindividual has a right to take any great share to himself. Our people in\r\na body are wise, because they are under the unrestrained and unperverted\r\noperation of their own understanding. Those whom they have assigned to\r\nthe direction of their affairs, have stood with a pretty even front.\r\nIf any one of them was withdrawn, many others entirely equal, have been\r\nready to fill his place with as good abilities. A nation, composed of such\r\nmaterials, and free in all its members from distressing wants, furnishes\r\nhopeful implements for the interesting experiment of self-government;\r\nand we feel that we are acting under obligations not confined to the\r\nlimits of our own society. It is impossible not to be sensible that we\r\nare acting for all mankind; that circumstances denied to others, but\r\nindulged to us, have imposed on us the duty of proving what is the degree\r\nof freedom and self-government in which a society may venture to leave\r\nits individual members. One passage, in the paper you enclosed me, must\r\nbe corrected. It is the following, \"and all say it was yourself more\r\nthan any other individual, that planned and established it,\" _i. e._ the\r\nConstitution. I was in Europe when the Constitution was planned, and never\r\nsaw it till after it was established. On receiving it I wrote strongly to\r\nMr. Madison, urging the want of provision for the freedom of religion,\r\nfreedom of the press, trial by jury, habeas corpus, the substitution of\r\nmilitia for a standing army, and an express reservation to the States of\r\nall rights not specifically granted to the Union. He accordingly moved in\r\nthe first session of Congress for these amendments, which were agreed to\r\nand ratified by the States as they now stand. This is all the hand I had\r\nin what related to the Constitution. Our predecessors made it doubtful\r\nhow far even these were of any value; for the very law which endangered\r\nyour personal safety, as well as that which restrained the freedom of\r\nthe press, were gross violations of them. However, it is still certain\r\nthat though written constitutions may be violated in moments of passion\r\nor delusion, yet they furnish a text to which those who are watchful\r\nmay again rally and recall the people; they fix too for the people the\r\nprinciples of their political creed. We shall all absent ourselves from\r\nthis place during the sickly season; say from about the 22d of July to the\r\nlast of September. Should your curiosity lead you hither either before or\r\nafter that interval, I shall be very happy to receive you, and shall claim\r\nyou as my guest. I wish the advantages of a mild over a winter climate\r\nhad been tried for you before you were located where you are. I have ever\r\nconsidered this as a public as well as personal misfortune. The choice you\r\nmade of our country for your asylum was honorable to it; and I lament that\r\nfor the sake of your happiness and health its most benign climates were\r\nnot selected. Certainly it is a truth that climate is one of the sources\r\nof the greatest sensual enjoyment. I received in due time the letter of\r\nApril 10th referred to in your last, with the pamphlet it enclosed, which\r\nI read with the pleasure I do everything from you. Accept assurances of my\r\nhighest veneration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RUFUS KING.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 13, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The course of things in the neighboring islands of the West\r\nIndies, appear to have given a considerable impulse to the minds of the\r\nslaves in different parts of the United States. A great disposition to\r\ninsurgency has manifested itself among them, which, in one instance, in\r\nthe State of Virginia, broke out into actual insurrection. This was easily\r\nsuppressed; but many of those concerned (between twenty and thirty, I\r\nbelieve) fell victims to the law. So extensive an execution could not\r\nbut excite sensibility in the public mind, and begat a regret that the\r\nlaws had not provided for such cases, some alternative, combining more\r\nmildness with equal efficacy. The Legislature of the State at a subsequent\r\nmeeting took the subject into consideration, and have communicated to\r\nme through the Governor of the State, their wish that some place could\r\nbe provided, out of the limits of the United States, to which slaves\r\nguilty of insurgency might be transported; and they have particularly\r\nlooked to Africa as offering the most desirable receptacle. We might,\r\nfor this purpose, enter into negotiations with the natives, on some part\r\nof the coast, to obtain a settlement; and, by establishing an African\r\ncompany, combine with it commercial operations, which might not only\r\nreimburse expenses, but procure profit also. But there being already such\r\nan establishment on that coast by the English Sierra Leone company, made\r\nfor the express purpose of colonizing civilized blacks to that country,\r\nit would seem better, by incorporating our emigrants with theirs, to\r\nmake one strong, rather than two weak colonies. This would be the more\r\ndesirable because the blacks settled at Sierra Leone having chiefly gone\r\nfrom the States, would often receive among those we should send, their\r\nacquaintances and relatives. The object of this letter therefore is to\r\nask the favor of you to enter into conference with such persons private\r\nand public as would be necessary to give us permission to send thither\r\nthe persons under contemplation. It is material to observe that they are\r\nnot felons, or common malefactors, but persons guilty of what the safety\r\nof society, under actual circumstances, obliges us to treat as a crime,\r\nbut which their feelings may represent in a far different shape. They are\r\nsuch as will be a valuable acquisition to the settlement already existing\r\nthere, and well calculated to co-operate in the plan of civilization.\r\n\r\nAs the expense of so distant a transportation would be very heavy, and\r\nmight weigh unfavorably in deciding between the modes of punishment, it\r\nis very desirable that it should be lessened as much as practicable. If\r\nthe regulations of the place would permit these emigrants to dispose of\r\nthemselves, as the Germans and others do who come to this country poor,\r\nby giving their labor for a certain time to some one who will pay their\r\npassage; and if the master of the vessel could be permitted to carry\r\narticles of commerce from this country and take back others from that,\r\nwhich might yield him a mercantile profit sufficient to cover the expenses\r\nof the voyage, a serious difficulty would be removed. I will ask your\r\nattention therefore to arrangements necessary for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe consequences of permitting emancipations to become extensive, unless\r\nthe condition of emigration be annexed to them, furnish also matter of\r\nsolicitation to the Legislature of Virginia, as you will perceive by\r\ntheir resolution enclosed to you. Although provision for the settlement of\r\nemancipated negroes might perhaps be obtainable nearer home than Africa,\r\nyet it is desirable that we should be free to expatriate this description\r\nof people also to the colony of Sierra Leone, if considerations respecting\r\neither themselves or us should render it more expedient. I will pray you\r\ntherefore to get the same permission extended to the reception of these\r\nas well as the first mentioned. Nor will there be a selection of bad\r\nsubjects; the emancipations, for the most part, being either of the whole\r\nslaves of the master, or of such individuals as have particularly deserved\r\nwell: the latter is most frequent.\r\n\r\nThe request of the Legislature of Virginia having produced to me the\r\noccasion of addressing you, I avail myself of it to assure you of my\r\nperfect satisfaction with the manner in which you have conducted the\r\nseveral matters confided to you by us; and to express my hope that through\r\nyour agency we may be able to remove everything inauspicious to a cordial\r\nfriendship between this country and the one in which you are stationed;\r\na friendship dictated by too many considerations not to be felt by the\r\nwise and the dispassionate of both nations. It is therefore with the\r\nsincerest pleasure I have observed on the part of the British government\r\nvarious manifestations of just and friendly disposition towards us. We\r\nwish to cultivate peace and friendship with all nations, believing that\r\ncourse most conducive to the welfare of our own. It is natural that these\r\nfriendships should bear some proportion to the common interests of the\r\nparties. The interesting relations between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates, are certainly of the first order; and as such are estimated,\r\nand will be faithfully cultivated by us. These sentiments have been\r\ncommunicated to you from time to time in the official correspondence of\r\nthe Secretary of State; but I have thought it might not be unacceptable\r\nto be assured that they perfectly concur with my own personal convictions,\r\nboth in relation to yourself and the country in which you are. I pray you\r\nto accept assurances of my high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 15, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 7th has been duly received. I am really\r\nmortified at the base ingratitude of Callendar. It presents human nature\r\nin a hideous form. It gives me concern, because I perceive that relief,\r\nwhich was afforded him on mere motives of charity, may be viewed under\r\nthe aspect of employing him as a writer. When the Political Progress of\r\nBritain first appeared in this country, it was in a periodical publication\r\ncalled the Bee, where I saw it. I was speaking of it in terms of strong\r\napprobation to a friend in Philadelphia, when he asked me if I knew that\r\nthe author was then in the city, a fugitive from prosecution on account of\r\nthat work, and in want of employ for his subsistence. This was the first\r\nof my learning that Callendar was the author of the work. I considered him\r\nas a man of science fled from persecution, and assured my friend of my\r\nreadiness to do whatever could serve him. It was long after this before\r\nI saw him; probably not till 1798. He had, in the meantime, written a\r\nsecond part of the Political Progress, much inferior to the first, and\r\nhis History of the United States. In 1798, I think, I was applied to by\r\nMr. Lieper to contribute to his relief. I did so. In 1799, I think, S. T.\r\nMason applied for him. I contributed again. He had, by this time, paid me\r\ntwo or three personal visits. When he fled in a panic from Philadelphia to\r\nGeneral Mason's, he wrote to me that he was a fugitive in want of employ,\r\nwished to know if he could get into a counting-house or a school, in my\r\nneighborhood or in that of Richmond; that he had materials for a volume,\r\nand if he could get as much money as would buy the paper, the profit of\r\nthe sale would be all his own. I availed myself of this pretext to cover\r\na mere charity, by desiring him to consider me a subscriber for as many\r\ncopies of his book as the money enclosed (fifty dollars) amounted to; but\r\nto send me two copies only, as the others might lay till called for. But\r\nI discouraged his coming into my neighborhood. His first writings here had\r\nfallen far short of his original Political Progress, and the scurrilities\r\nof his subsequent ones began evidently to do mischief. As to myself,\r\nno man wished more to see his pen stopped; but I considered him still\r\nas a proper object of benevolence. The succeeding year, he again wanted\r\nmoney to buy paper for another volume. I made his letter, as before, the\r\noccasion of giving him another fifty dollars. He considers these as proofs\r\nof my approbation of his writings, when they were mere charities, yielded\r\nunder a strong conviction that he was injuring us by his writings. It is\r\nknown to many that the sums given to him were such, and even smaller than\r\nI was in the habit of giving to others in distress, of the federal as well\r\nas the republican party, without attention to political principles. Soon\r\nafter I was elected to the government, Callendar came on here, wishing to\r\nbe made postmaster at Richmond. I knew him to be totally unfit for it;\r\nand however ready I was to aid him with my own charities, (and I then\r\ngave him fifty dollars,) I did not think the public offices confided\r\nto me to give away as charities. He took it in mortal offence, and from\r\nthat moment has been hauling off to his former enemies, the federalists.\r\nBesides the letter I wrote him in answer to the one from General Mason's,\r\nI wrote him another, containing answers to two questions he addressed\r\nto me. 1. Whether Mr. Jay received salary as Chief Justice and Envoy at\r\nthe same time; and 2, something relative to the expenses of an embassy\r\nto Constantinople. I think these were the only letters I ever wrote him\r\nin answer to volumes he was perpetually writing to me. This is the true\r\nstate of what has passed between him and me. I do not know that it can be\r\nused without committing me in controversy, as it were, with one too little\r\nrespected by the public to merit that notice. I leave to your judgment\r\nwhat use can be made of these facts. Perhaps it will be better judged of,\r\nwhen we see what use the tories will endeavor to make of their new friend.\r\nI shall leave this on the 21st, and be at Monticello probably on the 24th,\r\nor within two or three days of that, and shall hope, ere long, to see you\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 17, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--After writing you on the 15th, I turned to my letter file to\r\nsee what letters I had written to Callendar, and found them to have been\r\nof the dates of 1798, October the 11th, and 1799, September the 6th,\r\nand October the 6th; but on looking for the letters, they were not in\r\ntheir places, nor to be found. On recollection, I believe I sent them\r\nto you a year or two ago. If you have them, I shall be glad to receive\r\nthem at Monticello, where I shall be on this day se'nnight. I enclose\r\nyou a paper which shows the tories mean to pervert these charities to\r\nCallendar as much as they can. They will probably first represent me as\r\nthe patron and support of the Prospect before us, and other things of\r\nCallender's; and then picking out all the scurrilities of the author\r\nagainst General Washington, Mr. Adams, and others, impute them to me.\r\nI, as well as most other republicans who were in the way of doing it,\r\ncontributed what I could afford to the support of the republican papers\r\nand printers, paid sums of money for the Bee, the Albany Register, &c.,\r\nwhen they were staggering under the sedition law; contributed to the fines\r\nof Callendar himself, of Holt, Brown and others, suffering under that law.\r\nI discharged, when I came into office, such as were under the persecution\r\nof our enemies, without instituting any prosecutions in retaliation.\r\nThey may, therefore, with the same justice, impute to me, or to every\r\nrepublican contributor, everything which was ever published in those\r\npapers or by those persons. I must correct a fact in mine of the 15th.\r\nI find I did not enclose the fifty dollars to Callendar himself while at\r\nGeneral Mason's, but authorized the general to draw on my correspondent at\r\nRichmond, and to give the money to Callendar. So the other fifty dollars\r\nof which he speaks were by order on my correspondent at Richmond.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my affectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 10, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The departure of Madame Brugnard for France furnishes me a safe\r\nconveyance of a letter, which I cannot avoid embracing, although I have\r\nnothing particular for the subject of it. It is well, however, to be able\r\nto inform you, generally, through a safe channel, that we stand completely\r\ncorrected of the error, that either the government or the nation of France\r\nhas any remains of friendship for us. The portion of that country which\r\nforms an exception, though respectable in weight, is weak in numbers. On\r\nthe contrary, it appears evident, that an unfriendly spirit prevails in\r\nthe most important individuals of the government, towards us. In this\r\nstate of things, we shall so take our distance between the two rival\r\nnations, as, remaining disengaged till necessity compels us, we may haul\r\nfinally to the enemy of that which shall make it necessary. We see all\r\nthe disadvantageous consequences of taking a side, and shall be forced\r\ninto it only by a more disagreeable alternative; in which event, we must\r\ncountervail the disadvantages by measures which will give us splendor\r\nand power, but not as much happiness as our present system. We wish,\r\ntherefore, to remain well with France. But we see that no consequences,\r\nhowever ruinous to them, can secure us with certainty against the\r\nextravagance of her present rulers. I think, therefore, that while we\r\ndo nothing which the first nation on earth would deem crouching, we had\r\nbetter give to all our communications with them a very mild, complaisant,\r\nand even friendly complexion, but always independent. Ask no favors,\r\nleave small and irritating things to be conducted by the individuals\r\ninterested in them, interfere ourselves but in the greatest cases, and\r\nthen not push them to irritation. No matter at present existing between\r\nthem and us is important enough to risk a breach of peace; peace being\r\nindeed the most important of all things for us, except the preserving an\r\nerect and independent attitude. Although I know your own judgment leads\r\nyou to pursue this line identically, yet I thought it just to strengthen\r\nit by the concurrence of my own. You will have seen by our newspapers,\r\nthat with the aid of a lying renegado from republicanism, the federalists\r\nhave opened all their sluices of calumny. They say we lied them out of\r\npower, and openly avow they will do the same by us. But it was not lies or\r\narguments on our part which dethroned them, but their own foolish acts,\r\nsedition laws, alien laws, taxes, extravagances and heresies. Porcupine,\r\ntheir friend, wrote them down. Callendar, their new recruit, will do\r\nthe same. Every decent man among them revolts at his filth; and there\r\ncannot be a doubt, that were a Presidential election to come on this day,\r\nthey would certainly have but three New England States, and about half a\r\ndozen votes from Maryland and North Carolina; these two States electing\r\nby districts. Were all the States to elect by a general ticket, they\r\nwould have but three out of sixteen States. And these three are coming up\r\nslowly. We do, indeed, consider Jersey and Delaware as rather doubtful.\r\nElections which have lately taken place there, but their event not yet\r\nknown here, will show the present point of their varying condition.\r\n\r\n_My_ letters to you being merely private, I leave all details of business\r\nto their official channel.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant friendship and high respect.\r\n\r\nP. S. We have received your letter announcing the arrival of Mr. Dupont.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          October 13, 1802.\r\n\r\nYou know my doubts, or rather convictions, about the unconstitutionality\r\nof the act for building piers in the Delaware, and the fears that it\r\nwill lead to a bottomless expense, and to the greatest abuses. There\r\nis, however, one intention of which the act is susceptible, and which\r\nwill bring it within the Constitution; and we ought always to presume\r\nthat the real intention which is alone consistent with the Constitution.\r\nAlthough the power to regulate commerce does not give a power to build\r\npiers, wharves, open ports, clear the beds of rivers, dig canals, build\r\nwarehouses, build manufacturing machines, set up manufactories, cultivate\r\nthe earth, to all of which the power would go if it went to the first, yet\r\na power to provide and maintain a navy, is a power to provide receptacles\r\nfor it, and places to cover and preserve it. In choosing the places\r\nwhere this money should be laid out, I should be much disposed, as far\r\nas contracts will permit, to confine it to such place or places as the\r\nships of war may lie at, and be protected from ice; and I should be for\r\nstating this in a message to Congress, in order to prevent the effect of\r\nthe present example. This act has been built on the exercise of the power\r\nof building light houses, as a regulation of commerce. But I well remember\r\nthe opposition, on this very ground, to the first act for building a light\r\nhouse. The utility of the thing has sanctioned the infraction. But if on\r\nthat infraction we build a second, on that second a third, &c., any one\r\nof the powers in the Constitution may be made to comprehend every power\r\nof government. Will you read the enclosed letters on the subject of New\r\nOrleans, and think what we can do or propose in the case?\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 25, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 16th is received, and that of July the 24th\r\nhad come to hand while I was at Monticello. I sincerely condole with\r\nyou on the sickly state of your family, and hope this will find them\r\nre-established with the approach of the cold season. As yet, however,\r\nwe have had no frost in this place, and it is believed the yellow fever\r\nstill continues in Philadelphia, if not in Baltimore. We shall all be\r\nhappy to see you here whenever the state of your family admits it. You\r\nwill have seen by the newspapers that we have gained ground generally\r\nin the elections, that we have lost ground in not a single district of\r\nthe United States, except Kent county in Delaware, where a religious\r\ndissension occasioned it. In Jersey the elections are always carried\r\nby small majorities, consequently the issue is affected by the smallest\r\naccidents. By the paper of the last night we have a majority of three in\r\ntheir Council, and one in their House of Representatives; another says\r\nit is only of one in each House: even the latter is sufficient for every\r\npurpose. The opinion I originally formed has never been changed, that\r\nsuch of the body of the people as thought themselves federalists, would\r\nfind that they were in truth republicans, and would come over to us by\r\ndegrees; but that their leaders had gone too far ever to change. Their\r\nbitterness increases with their desperation. They are trying slanders now\r\nwhich nothing could prompt but a gall which blinds their judgments as well\r\nas their consciences. I shall take no other revenge, than, by a steady\r\npursuit of economy and peace, and by the establishment of republican\r\nprinciples in substance and in form, to sink federalism into an abyss from\r\nwhich there shall be no resurrection for it. I still think our original\r\nidea as to office is best: that is, to depend, for the obtaining a just\r\nparticipation, on deaths, resignations, and delinquencies. This will\r\nleast affect the tranquillity of the people, and prevent their giving into\r\nthe suggestion of our enemies, that ours has been a contest for office,\r\nnot for principle. This is rather a slow operation, but it is sure if we\r\npursue it steadily, which, however, has not been done with the undeviating\r\nresolution I could have wished. To these means of obtaining a just share\r\nin the transaction of the public business, shall be added one other,\r\nto wit, removal for electioneering activity, or open and industrious\r\nopposition to the principles of the present government, legislative and\r\nexecutive. Every officer of the government may vote at elections according\r\nto his conscience; but we should betray the cause committed to our care,\r\nwere we to permit the influence of official patronage to be used to\r\noverthrow that cause. Your present situation will enable you to judge of\r\nprominent offenders in your State, in the case of the present election. I\r\npray you to seek them, to mark them, to be quite sure of your ground, that\r\nwe may commit no error or wrong, and leave the rest to me. I have been\r\nurged to remove Mr. Whittemore, the surveyor of Gloucester, on grounds of\r\nneglect of duty and industrious opposition. Yet no facts are so distinctly\r\ncharged as to make the step sure which we should take in this. Will you\r\ntake the trouble to satisfy yourself on this point? I think it not amiss\r\nthat it should be known that we are determined to remove officers who\r\nare active or open mouthed against the government, by which I mean the\r\nlegislature as well as the executive. Accept assurances of my sincere\r\nfriendship and high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS COOPER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 29, 1802.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of October 25th was received in due time, and I\r\nthank you for the long extract you took the trouble of making from Mr.\r\nStone's letter. Certainly the information it communicates as to Alexander\r\nkindles a great deal of interest in his existence, and strong spasms of\r\nthe heart in his favor. Though his means of doing good are great, yet the\r\nmaterials on which he is to work are refractory. Whether he engages in\r\nprivate correspondences abroad, as the King of Prussia did much, and his\r\ngrandfather sometimes, I know not; but certainly such a correspondence\r\nwould be very interesting to those who are sincerely anxious to see\r\nmankind raised from their present abject condition. It delights me to find\r\nthat there are persons who still think that all is not lost in France:\r\nthat their retrogradation from a limited to an unlimited despotism, is\r\nbut to give themselves a new impulse. But I see not how or when. The\r\npress, the only tocsin of a nation, is completely silenced there, and all\r\nmeans of a general effort taken away. However, I am willing to hope, and\r\nas long as anybody will hope with me; and I am entirely persuaded that\r\nthe agitations of the public mind advance its powers, and that at every\r\nvibration between the points of liberty and despotism, something will be\r\ngained for the former. As men become better informed, their rulers must\r\nrespect them the more. I think you will be sensible that our citizens are\r\nfast returning, from the panic into which they were artfully thrown to the\r\ndictates of their own reason; and I believe the delusions they have seen\r\nthemselves hurried into will be useful as a lesson under similar attempts\r\non them in future. The good effects of our late fiscal arrangements will\r\ncertainly tend to unite them in opinion, and in confidence as to the\r\nviews of their public functionaries, legislative and executive. The path\r\nwe have to pursue is so quiet that we have nothing scarcely to propose to\r\nour Legislature. A noiseless course, meddling with the affairs of others,\r\nunattractive of notice, is a mark that society is going on in happiness.\r\nIf we can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people,\r\nunder the pretence of taking care of them, they must become happy. Their\r\nfinances are now under such a course of application as nothing could\r\nderange but war or federalism. The gripe of the latter has shown itself\r\nas deadly as the jaws of the former. Our adversaries say we are indebted\r\nto their providence for the means of paying the public debt. We never\r\ncharged them with the want of foresight in providing money, but with the\r\nmisapplication of it after they had provided it. We say they raised not\r\nonly enough, but too much; and that after giving back the surplus we do\r\nmore with a part than they did with the whole.\r\n\r\nYour letter of November 18th is also received. The places of midshipman\r\nare so much sought that (being limited) there is never a vacancy. Your son\r\nshall be set down for the 2d, which shall; the 1st being anticipated. We\r\nare not long generally without vacancies happening. As soon as he can be\r\nappointed you shall know it. I pray you to accept assurances of my great\r\nattachment and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR MONROE.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 13, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I dropped you a line on the 10th, informing you of a nomination\r\nI had made of you to the Senate, and yesterday I enclosed you their\r\napprobation, not then having time to write. The agitation of the public\r\nmind on occasion of the late suspension of our right of deposit at New\r\nOrleans is extreme. In the western country it is natural, and grounded\r\non honest motives. In the sea ports it proceeds from a desire for war,\r\nwhich increases the mercantile lottery: in the federalists, generally,\r\nand especially those of Congress, the object is to force us into war if\r\npossible, in order to derange our finances, or if this cannot be done,\r\nto attach the western country to them, as their best friends, and thus\r\nget again into power. Remonstrances, memorials, &c., are now circulating\r\nthrough the whole of the western country, and signed by the body of\r\nthe people. The measures we have been pursuing, being invisible, do not\r\nsatisfy their minds. Something sensible, therefore, has become necessary;\r\nand indeed our object of purchasing New Orleans and the Floridas is a\r\nmeasure liable to assume so many shapes, that no instructions could\r\nbe squared to fit them. It was essential then, to send a minister\r\nextraordinary, to be joined with the ordinary one, with discretionary\r\npowers; first, however, well impressed with all our views, and therefore\r\nqualified to meet and modify to these every form of proposition which\r\ncould come from the other party. This could be done only in full and\r\nfrequent oral communications. Having determined on this, there could not\r\nbe two opinions among the republicans as to the person. You possessed the\r\nunlimited confidence of the administration and of the western people; and\r\ngenerally of the republicans everywhere; and were you to refuse to go, no\r\nother man can be found who does this. The measure has already silenced\r\nthe federalists here. Congress will no longer be agitated by them; and\r\nthe country will become calm fast as the information extends over it. All\r\neyes, all hopes are now fixed on you; and were you to decline, the chagrin\r\nwould be universal, and would shake under your feet the high ground\r\non which you stand with the public. Indeed, I know nothing which would\r\nproduce such a shock. For on the event of this mission depend the future\r\ndestinies of this republic. If we cannot by a purchase of the country,\r\ninsure to ourselves a course of perpetual peace and friendship with all\r\nnations, then as war cannot be distant, it behooves us immediately to be\r\npreparing for that course, without, however, hastening it; and it may\r\nbe necessary (on your failure on the continent) to cross the channel.\r\nWe shall get entangled in European politics, and figuring more, be much\r\nless happy and prosperous. This can only be prevented by a successful\r\nissue to your present mission. I am sensible after the measures you have\r\ntaken for getting into a different line of business, that it will be\r\na great sacrifice on your part, and presents from the season and other\r\ncircumstances serious difficulties. But some men are born for the public.\r\nNature by fitting them for the service of the human race on a broad scale,\r\nhas stamped them with the evidences of her destination and their duty.\r\n\r\nBut I am particularly concerned, that, in the present case, you have\r\nmore than one sacrifice to make. To reform the prodigalities of our\r\npredecessors is understood to be peculiarly our duty, and to bring the\r\ngovernment to a simple and economical course. They, in order to increase\r\nexpense, debt, taxation and patronage, tried always how much they could\r\ngive. The outfit given to ministers resident to enable them to furnish\r\ntheir house, but given by no nation to a temporary minister, who is never\r\nexpected to take a house or to entertain, but considered on the footing of\r\na _voyageur_, they gave to their extraordinary ministers by wholesale. In\r\nthe beginning of our administration, among other articles of reformation\r\nin expense, it was determined not to give an outfit to ministers\r\nextraordinary, and not to incur the expense with any minister of sending\r\na frigate to carry or bring him. The Boston happened to be going to the\r\nMediterranean, and was permitted, therefore, to take up Mr. Livingston,\r\nand touch in a port of France. A frigate was denied to Charles Pinckney,\r\nand has been refused to Mr. King for his return. Mr. Madison's friendship\r\nand mine to you being so well known, the public will have eagle eyes to\r\nwatch if we grant you any indulgences out of the general rule; and on the\r\nother hand, the example set in your case will be more cogent on future\r\nones, and produce greater approbation to our conduct. The allowance,\r\ntherefore, will be in this, and all similar cases, all the expenses of\r\nyour journey and voyage, taking a ship's cabin to yourself, nine thousand\r\ndollars a year from your leaving home till the proceedings of your mission\r\nare terminated, and then the quarter's salary for the expenses of your\r\nreturn, as prescribed by law. As to the time of your going, you cannot too\r\nmuch hasten it, as the moment in France is critical. St. Domingo delays\r\ntheir taking possession of Louisiana, and they are in the last distress\r\nfor money for current purposes. You should arrange your affairs for an\r\nabsence of a year at least, perhaps for a long one. It will be necessary\r\nfor you to stay here some days on your way to New York. You will receive\r\nhere what advance you choose.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my constant and affectionate attachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, February 1, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of August\r\nthe 16th and October the 4th. The latter I received with peculiar\r\nsatisfaction; because, while it holds up terms which cannot be entirely\r\nyielded, it proposes such as a mutual spirit of accommodation and\r\nsacrifice of opinion may bring to some point of union. While we were\r\npreparing on this subject such modifications of the propositions of your\r\nletter of October the 4th, as we could assent to, an event happened\r\nwhich obliged us to adopt measures of urgency. The suspension of the\r\nright of deposit at New Orleans, ceded to us by our treaty with Spain,\r\nthrew our whole country into such a ferment as imminently threatened\r\nits peace. This, however, was believed to be the act of the Intendant,\r\nunauthorized by his government. But it showed the necessity of making\r\neffectual arrangements to secure the peace of the two countries against\r\nthe indiscreet acts of subordinate agents. The urgency of the case, as\r\nwell as the public spirit, therefore induced us to make a more solemn\r\nappeal to the justice and judgment of our neighbors, by sending a minister\r\nextraordinary to impress them with the necessity of some arrangement.\r\nMr. Monroe has been selected. His good dispositions cannot be doubted.\r\nMultiplied conversations with him, and views of the subject taken in\r\nall the shapes in which it can present itself, have possessed him with\r\nour estimates of everything relating to it, with a minuteness which no\r\nwritten communication to Mr. Livingston could ever have attained. These\r\nwill prepare them to meet and decide on every form of proposition which\r\ncan occur, without awaiting new instructions from hence, which might\r\ndraw to an indefinite length a discussion where circumstances imperiously\r\noblige us to a prompt decision. For the occlusion of the Mississippi is a\r\nstate of things in which we cannot exist. He goes, therefore, joined with\r\nChancellor Livingston, to aid in the issue of a crisis the most important\r\nthe United States have ever met since their independence, and which is\r\nto decide their future character and career. The confidence which the\r\ngovernment of France reposes in you, will undoubtedly give great weight\r\nto your information. An equal confidence on our part, founded on your\r\nknowledge of the subject, your just views of it, your good dispositions\r\ntowards this country, and my long experience of your personal faith\r\nand friendship, assures me that you will render between us all the\r\ngood offices in your power. The interests of the two countries being\r\nabsolutely the same as to this matter, your aid may be conscientiously\r\ngiven. It will often perhaps, be possible for you, having a freedom\r\nof communication, _omnibus horis_, which diplomatic gentlemen will be\r\nexcluded from by forms, to smooth difficulties by representations and\r\nreasonings, which would be received with more suspicion from them. You\r\nwill thereby render great good to both countries. For our circumstances\r\nare so imperious as to admit of no delay as to our course; and the use\r\nof the Mississippi so indispensable, that we cannot hesitate one moment\r\nto hazard our existence for its maintenance. If we fail in this effort to\r\nput it beyond the reach of accident, we see the destinies we have to run,\r\nand prepare at once for them. Not but that we shall still endeavor to go\r\non in peace and friendship with our neighbors as long as we can, _if our\r\nrights of navigation and deposit are respected_; but as we foresee that\r\nthe caprices of the local officers, and the abuse of those rights by our\r\nboatmen and navigators, which neither government can prevent, will keep\r\nup a state of irritation which cannot long be kept inactive, we should\r\nbe criminally improvident not to take at once eventual measures for\r\nstrengthening ourselves for the contest. It may be said, if this object\r\nbe so all-important to us, why do we not offer such a sum to as to insure\r\nits purchase? The answer is simple. We are an agricultural people, poor\r\nin money, and owing great debts. These will be falling due by instalments\r\nfor fifteen years to come, and require from us the practice of a rigorous\r\neconomy to accomplish their payment; and it is our principle to pay to a\r\nmoment whatever we have engaged, and never to engage what we cannot, and\r\nmean not faithfully to pay. We have calculated our resources, and find\r\nthe sum to be moderate which they would enable us to pay, and we know from\r\nlate trials that little can be added to it by borrowing. The country, too,\r\nwhich we wish to purchase, except the portion already granted, and which\r\nmust be confirmed to the private holders, is a barren sand, six hundred\r\nmiles from east to west, and from thirty to forty and fifty miles from\r\nnorth to south, formed by deposition of the sands by the Gulf Stream in\r\nits circular course round the Mexican Gulf, and which being spent after\r\nperforming a semicircle, has made from its last depositions the sand bank\r\nof East Florida. In West Florida, indeed, there are on the borders of\r\nthe rivers some rich bottoms, formed by the mud brought from the upper\r\ncountry. These bottoms are all possessed by individuals. But the spaces\r\nbetween river and river are mere banks of sand; and in East Florida there\r\nare neither rivers, nor consequently any bottoms. We cannot then make\r\nanything by a sale of the lands to individuals. So that it is peace alone\r\nwhich makes it an object with us, and which ought to make the cession of\r\nit desirable to France. Whatever power, other than ourselves, holds the\r\ncountry east of the Mississippi becomes our natural enemy. Will such a\r\npossession do France as much good, as such an enemy may do her harm? And\r\nhow long would it be hers, were such an enemy, situated at its door, added\r\nto Great Britain? I confess, it appears to me as essential to France to\r\nkeep at peace with us, as it is to us to keep at peace with her; and that,\r\nif this cannot be secured without some compromise as to the territory in\r\nquestion, it will be useful for both to make some sacrifices to effect the\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nYou see, my good friend, with what frankness I communicate with you on\r\nthis subject; that I hide nothing from you, and that I am endeavoring\r\nto turn our private friendship to the good of our respective countries.\r\nAnd can private friendship ever answer a nobler end than by keeping two\r\nnations at peace, who, if this new position which one of them is taking\r\nwere rendered innocent, have more points of common interest, and fewer\r\nof collision, than any two on earth; who become natural friends, instead\r\nof natural enemies, which this change of position would make them. My\r\nletters of April the 25th, May the 5th, and this present one have been\r\nwritten, without any disguise, in this view; and while safe in your hands\r\nthey can never do anything but good. But you and I are now at that time\r\nof life when our call to another state of being cannot be distant, and\r\nmay be near. Besides, your government is in the habit of seizing papers\r\nwithout notice. These letters might thus get into hands, which, like the\r\nhornet which extracts poison from the same flower that yields honey to\r\nthe bee, might make them the ground of blowing up a flame between our two\r\ncountries, and make our friendship and confidence in each other effect\r\nexactly the reverse of what we are aiming it. Being yourself thoroughly\r\npossessed of every idea in them, let me ask from your friendship an\r\nimmediate consignment of them to the flames. That alone can make all safe,\r\nand ourselves secure.\r\n\r\nI intended to have answered you here, on the subject of your agency in the\r\ntransacting what money matters we may have at Paris, and for that purpose\r\nmeant to have conferred with Mr. Gallatin. But he has, for two or three\r\ndays, been confined to his room, and is not yet able to do business. If he\r\nis out before Mr. Monroe's departure, I will write an additional letter on\r\nthat subject. Be assured that it will be a great additional satisfaction\r\nto me to render services to yourself and sons by the same acts which shall\r\nat the same time promote the public service. Be so good as to present my\r\nrespectful salutations to Madame Dupont, and to accept yourself assurances\r\nof my constant and affectionate friendship and great respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHANCELLOR LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, February 3, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My last to you was by Mr. Dupont. Since that I received\r\nyours of May 22d. Mr. Madison supposes you have written a subsequent\r\none which has never come to hand. A late suspension by the Intendant of\r\nNew Orleans of our right of deposit there, without which the right of\r\nnavigation is impracticable, has thrown this country into such a flame of\r\nhostile disposition as can scarcely be described. The western country was\r\npeculiarly sensible to it as you may suppose. Our business was to take the\r\nmost effectual pacific measures in our power to remove the suspension,\r\nand at the same time to persuade our countrymen that pacific measures\r\nwould be the most effectual and the most speedily so. The opposition\r\ncaught it as a plank in a shipwreck, hoping it would enable them to tack\r\nthe Western people to them. They raised the cry of war, were intriguing\r\nin all quarters to exasperate the Western inhabitants to arm and go down\r\non their own authority and possess themselves of New Orleans, and in the\r\nmeantime were daily reiterating, in new shapes, inflammatory resolutions\r\nfor the adoption of the House. As a remedy to all this we determined to\r\nname a minister extraordinary to go immediately to Paris and Madrid to\r\nsettle this matter. This measure being a visible one, and the person named\r\npeculiarly proper with the Western country, crushed at once and put an\r\nend to all further attempts on the Legislature. From that moment all has\r\nbecome quiet; and the more readily in the Western country, as the sudden\r\nalliance of these new federal friends had of itself already began to make\r\nthem suspect the wisdom of their own course. The measure was moreover\r\nproposed from another cause. We must know at once whether we can acquire\r\nNew Orleans or not. We are satisfied nothing else will secure us against\r\na war at no distant period; and we cannot press this reason without\r\nbeginning those arrangements which will be necessary if war is hereafter\r\nto result. For this purpose it was necessary that the negotiators should\r\nbe fully possessed of every idea we have on the subject, so as to meet\r\nthe propositions of the opposite party, in whatever form they may be\r\noffered; and give them a shape admissible by us without being obliged to\r\nawait new instructions hence. With this view, we have joined Mr. Monroe\r\nwith yourself at Paris, and to Mr. Pintency at Madrid, although we believe\r\nit will be hardly necessary for him to go to this last place. Should we\r\nfail in this object of the mission, a further one will be superadded for\r\nthe other side of the channel. On this subject you will be informed by\r\nthe Secretary of State, and Mr. Monroe will be able also to inform you\r\nof all our views and purposes. By him I send another letter to Dupont,\r\nwhose aid may be of the greatest service, as it will be divested of the\r\nshackles of form. The letter is left open for your perusal, after which\r\nI wish a wafer stuck in it before it be delivered. The official and the\r\nverbal communications to you by Mr. Monroe will be so full and minute,\r\nthat I need not trouble you with an inofficial repetition of them. The\r\nfuture destinies of our country hang on the event of this negotiation,\r\nand I am sure they could not be placed in more able or more zealous hands.\r\nOn our parts we shall be satisfied that what you do not effect, cannot be\r\neffected. Accept therefore assurances of my sincere and constant affection\r\nand high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. PICTET.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, February 5, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is long since I might have acknowledged your favor of May\r\n20, 1801, which however I did not receive till January, 1802. My incessant\r\noccupations on matters which will not bear delay, occasion those which\r\ncan be put off to lie often for a considerable time. I rejoice that the\r\nopinion which I gave you on the removal hither proved useful. I knew\r\nit was not safe for you to take such a step until it would be done on\r\nsure ground. I hoped at that time that some canal shares, which were\r\nat the disposal of General Washington, might have been applied towards\r\nthe establishment of a good seminary of learning; but he had already\r\nproceeded too far on another plan to change their direction. I have still\r\nhad constantly in view to propose to the legislature of Virginia the\r\nestablishment of one on as large a scale as our present circumstances\r\nwould require or bear. But as yet no favorable moment has occurred. In\r\nthe meanwhile I am endeavoring to procure materials for a good plan.\r\nWith this view I am to ask the favor of you to give me a sketch of the\r\nbranches of science taught in your college, how they are distributed among\r\nthe professors, that is to say, how many professors there are, and what\r\nbranches of science are allotted to each professor, and the days and hours\r\nassigned to each branch. Your successful experience in the distribution of\r\nbusiness will be a valuable guide to us, who are without experience. I am\r\nsensible I am imposing on your goodness a troublesome task; but I believe\r\nevery son of science feels a strong and disinterested desire of promoting\r\nit in every part of the earth, and it is the consciousness as well as\r\nconfidence in this which emboldens me to make the present request.\r\n\r\nIn the line of science we have little new here. Our citizens almost\r\nall follow some industrious occupation, and therefore have little\r\ntime to devote to abstract science. In the arts, and especially in the\r\nmechanical arts, many ingenious improvements are made in consequence\r\nof the patent-right giving exclusive use of them for fourteen years.\r\nBut the great mass of our people are agricultural; and the commercial\r\ncities, though, by the command of newspapers, they make a great deal\r\nof noise, have little effect in the direction of the government. They\r\nare as different in sentiment and character from the country people as\r\nany two distinct nations, and are clamorous against the order of things\r\nestablished by the agricultural interest. Under this order, our citizens\r\ngenerally are enjoying a very great degree of liberty and security in the\r\nmost temperate manner. Every man being at his ease, feels an interest in\r\nthe preservation of order, and comes forth to preserve it at the first\r\ncall of the magistrate. We are endeavoring too to reduce the government\r\nto the practice of a rigorous economy, to avoid burthening the people,\r\nand arming the magistrate with a patronage of money, which might be used\r\nto corrupt and undermine the principles of our government. I state these\r\ngeneral outlines to you, because I believe you take some interest in our\r\nfortune, and because our newspapers for the most part, present only the\r\ncaricatures of disaffected minds. Indeed the abuses of the freedom of\r\nthe press here have been carried to a length never before known or borne\r\nby any civilized nation. But it is so difficult to draw a clear line of\r\nseparation between the abuse and the wholesome use of the press, that\r\nas yet we have found it better to trust the public judgment, rather than\r\nthe magistrate, with the discrimination between truth and falsehood. And\r\nhitherto the public judgment has performed that office with wonderful\r\ncorrectness. Should you favor me with a letter, the safest channel of\r\nconveyance will be the American minister at Paris or London. I pray you to\r\naccept assurances of my great esteem, and high respect and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL JACKSON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 16, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 14th was received on the same day, and will\r\nbe duly attended to in the course of our affairs with the Creeks. In\r\nkeeping agents among the Indians, two objects are principally in view: 1.\r\nThe preservation of peace; 2. The obtaining lands. Towards effecting the\r\nlatter object, we consider the leading the Indians to agriculture as the\r\nprincipal means from which we can expect much effect in future. When they\r\nshall cultivate small spots of earth, and see how useless their extensive\r\nforests are, they will sell, from time to time, to help out their personal\r\nlabor in stocking their farms, and procuring clothes and comforts from\r\nour trading houses. Towards the attainment of our two objects of peace\r\nand lands, it is essential that our agent acquire that sort of influence\r\nover the Indians which rests on confidence. In this respect, I suppose\r\nthat no man has ever obtained more influence than Colonel Hawkins. Towards\r\nthe preservation of peace, he is omnipotent; in the encouragement of\r\nagriculture, he is indefatigable and successful. These are important\r\nportions of his duty. But doubts are entertained by some whether he is not\r\nmore attached to the interests of the Indians than of the United States;\r\nwhether he is willing they should cede lands, when they are willing to do\r\nit. If his own solemn protestations can command any faith, he urges the\r\nceding lands as far as he finds it practicable to induce them. He only\r\nrefuses to urge what he knows cannot be obtained. He is not willing to\r\ndestroy his own influence by pressing what he knows cannot be obtained.\r\nThis is his representation. Against this I should not be willing to\r\nsubstitute suspicion for proof; but I shall always be open to any proofs\r\nthat he obstructs cessions of land which the Indians are willing to make;\r\nand of this, Sir, you may be assured, that he shall be placed under as\r\nstrong a pressure from the executive to obtain cessions as he can feel\r\nfrom any opposite quarter to obstruct. He shall be made sensible that\r\nhis value will be estimated by us in proportion to the benefits he can\r\nobtain for us. I am myself alive to the obtaining lands from the Indians\r\nby all _honest and peaceable means_, and I believe that the honest and\r\npeaceable means adopted by us will obtain them as fast as the expansion\r\nof our settlements, with due regard to compactness, will require. The war\r\ndepartment, charged with Indian affairs, is under the impression of these\r\nprinciples, and will second my views with sincerity. And, in the present\r\ncase, besides the official directions which will go to Colonel Hawkins,\r\nimmediately to spare no efforts from which any success can be hoped to\r\nobtain the residue of the Oconee and Oakmulgee fork, I shall myself write\r\nto Colonel Hawkins, and possess him fully of my views and expectations;\r\nand this with such explanations as I trust will bring him cordially into\r\nthem, as they are unquestionably equally for the interest of the Indians\r\nand ourselves.\r\n\r\nI have availed myself of the occasion furnished by your letter\r\nof explaining to you my views on this subject with candor, and of\r\nassuring you they shall be pursued unremittingly. When speaking of\r\nthe Oakmulgee fork, I ought to have added, that we shall do whatever\r\ncan be done properly in behalf of Wafford's settlement; and that as to\r\nthe South-Eastern road, it will be effected, as we consider ourselves\r\nentitled, on principles acknowledged by all men, to an innocent passage\r\nthrough the lands of a neighbor, and to admit no refusal of it. Accept\r\nassurances of my great esteem and high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COLONEL HAWKINS.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 18, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Hill's return to you offers so safe a conveyance for a\r\nletter, that I feel irresistibly disposed to write one, though there is\r\nbut little to write about. You have been so long absent from this part of\r\nthe world, and the state of society so changed in that time, that details\r\nrespecting those who compose it are no longer interesting or intelligible\r\nto you. One source of great change in social intercourse arose while\r\nyou were with us, though its effects were as yet scarcely sensible on\r\nsociety or government. I mean the British treaty, which produced a schism\r\nthat went on widening and rankling till the years '98, '99, when a final\r\ndissolution of all bonds, civil and social, appeared imminent. In that\r\nawful crisis, the people awaked from the phrenzy into which they had been\r\nthrown, began to return to their sober and ancient principles, and have\r\nnow become five-sixths of one sentiment, to wit, for peace, economy, and a\r\ngovernment bottomed on popular election in its legislative and executive\r\nbranches. In the public counsels the federal party hold still one-third.\r\nThis, however, will lessen, but not exactly to the standard of the people;\r\nbecause it will be forever seen that of bodies of men even elected by the\r\npeople, there will always be a greater proportion aristocratic than among\r\ntheir constituents. The present administration had a task imposed on it\r\nwhich was unavoidable, and could not fail to exert the bitterest hostility\r\nin those opposed to it. The preceding administration left ninety-nine out\r\nof every hundred in public offices of the federal sect. Republicanism\r\nhad been the mark on Cain which had rendered those who bore it exiles\r\nfrom all portion in the trusts and authorities of their country. This\r\ndescription of citizens called imperiously and justly for a restoration\r\nof right. It was intended, however, to have yielded to this in so moderate\r\na degree as might conciliate those who had obtained exclusive possession;\r\nbut as soon as they were touched, they endeavored to set fire to the four\r\ncorners of the public fabric, and obliged us to deprive of the influence\r\nof office several who were using it with activity and vigilance to destroy\r\nthe confidence of the people in their government, and thus to proceed in\r\nthe drudgery of removal farther than would have been, had not their own\r\nhostile enterprises rendered it necessary in self-defence. But I think\r\nit will not be long before the whole nation will be consolidated in their\r\nancient principles, excepting a few who have committed themselves beyond\r\nrecall, and who will retire to obscurity and settled disaffection.\r\n\r\nAlthough you will receive, through the official channel of the War Office,\r\nevery communication necessary to develop to you our views respecting\r\nthe Indians, and to direct your conduct, yet, supposing it will be\r\nsatisfactory to you, and to those with whom you are placed, to understand\r\nmy personal dispositions and opinions in this particular, I shall avail\r\nmyself of this private letter to state them generally. I consider the\r\nbusiness of hunting as already become insufficient to furnish clothing\r\nand subsistence to the Indians. The promotion of agriculture, therefore,\r\nand household manufacture, are essential in their preservation, and I\r\nam disposed to aid and encourage it liberally. This will enable them to\r\nlive on much smaller portions of land, and indeed will render their vast\r\nforests useless but for the range of cattle; for which purpose, also,\r\nas they become better farmers, they will be found useless, and even\r\ndisadvantageous. While they are learning to do better on less land, our\r\nincreasing numbers will be calling for more land, and thus a coincidence\r\nof interests will be produced between those who have lands to spare, and\r\nwant other necessaries, and those who have such necessaries to spare, and\r\nwant lands. This commerce, then, will be for the good of both, and those\r\nwho are friends to both ought to encourage it. You are in the station\r\npeculiarly charged with this interchange, and who have it peculiarly in\r\nyour power to promote among the Indians a sense of the superior value\r\nof a little land, well cultivated, over a great deal, unimproved, and\r\nto encourage them to make this estimate truly. The wisdom of the animal\r\nwhich amputates and abandons to the hunter the parts for which he is\r\npursued should be theirs, with this difference, that the former sacrifices\r\nwhat is useful, the latter what is not. In truth, the ultimate point of\r\nrest and happiness for them is to let our settlements and theirs meet\r\nand blend together, to intermix, and become one people. Incorporating\r\nthemselves with us as citizens of the United States, this is what the\r\nnatural progress of things will of course bring on, and it will be better\r\nto promote than to retard it. Surely it will be better for them to be\r\nidentified with us, and preserved in the occupation of their lands, than\r\nbe exposed to the many casualties which may endanger them while a separate\r\npeople. I have little doubt but that your reflections must have led you\r\nto view the various ways in which their history may terminate, and to\r\nsee that this is the one most for their happiness. And we have already\r\nhad an application from a settlement of Indians to become citizens of\r\nthe United States. It is possible, perhaps probable, that this idea may\r\nbe so novel as that it might shock the Indians, were it even hinted to\r\nthem. Of course, you will keep it for your own reflection; but, convinced\r\nof its soundness, I feel it consistent with pure morality to lead them\r\ntowards it, to familiarize them to the idea that it is for their interest\r\nto cede lands at times to the United States, and for us thus to procure\r\ngratifications to our citizens, from time to time, by new acquisitions\r\nof land. From no quarter is there at present so strong a pressure on\r\nthis subject as from Georgia for the residue of the fork of Oconee and\r\nOakmulgee; and indeed I believe it will be difficult to resist it. As it\r\nhas been mentioned that the Creeks had at one time made up their minds\r\nto sell this, and were only checked in it by some indiscretion of an\r\nindividual, I am in hopes you will be able to bring them to it again. I\r\nbeseech you to use your most earnest endeavors; for it will relieve us\r\nhere from a great pressure, and yourself from the unreasonable suspicions\r\nof the Georgians which you notice, that you are more attached to the\r\ninterests of the Indians than of the United States, and throw cold\r\nwater on their willingness to part with lands. It is so easy to excite\r\nsuspicion, that none are to be wondered at; but I am in hopes it will be\r\nin your power to quash them by effecting the object.\r\n\r\nMr. Madison enjoys better health since his removal to this place than\r\nhe had done in Orange.

I learn you have the gout. I did not expect that Indian cookery\r\nor Indian fare would produce that; but it is considered as a security for\r\ngood health otherwise.

While, therefore, we\r\nare endeavoring, and with a considerable degree of confidence, to obtain\r\nby friendly negotiation a peaceable redress of the injury, and effectual\r\nprovision against its repetition, let us array the strength of the nation,\r\nand be ready to do with promptitude and effect whatever a regard to\r\njustice and our future security may require.\r\n\r\nIn order that I may have a full and correct view of the resources of our\r\ncountry in all its different parts, I must desire you, with as little\r\ndelay as possible, to have me furnished with a return of the militia, and\r\nof the arms and accoutrements of your State, and of the several counties,\r\nor other geographical divisions of it.\r\n\r\nAccept assurances of my high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. BARTON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 27, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I enclose to you a copy of two discourses sent you by Mr.\r\nLalepida through the hands of Mr. Paine, who delivered them with some sent\r\nme. What follows in that letter is strictly confidential. You know we have\r\nbeen many years wishing to have the Missouri explored, and whatever river,\r\nheading with that, runs into the western ocean. Congress, in some secret\r\nproceedings, have yielded to a proposition I made them for permitting\r\nme to have it done. It is to be undertaken immediately, with a party of\r\nabout ten, and I have appointed Captain Lewis, my Secretary, to conduct\r\nit. It was impossible to find a character who, to a complete science in\r\nBotany, Natural History, Mineralogy and Astronomy, joined the firmness of\r\nconstitution and character, prudence, habits adapted to the woods, and\r\nfamiliarity with the Indian manners and character, requisite for this\r\nundertaking. All the latter qualifications Captain Lewis has. Although\r\nno regular botanist, &c., he possesses a remarkable store of accurate\r\nobservation on all the subjects of the three kingdoms, and will therefore\r\nreadily single out whatever presents itself new to him in either; and\r\nhe has qualified himself for taking the observations of longitude and\r\nlatitude necessary to fix the geography of the line he passes through.\r\nIn order to draw his attention at once, to the objects most desirable, I\r\nmust ask the favor of you to prepare for him a note of those in the lines\r\nof botany, zoology, or of Indian history, which you think most worthy of\r\nenquiry and observation. He will be with you in Philadelphia in two or\r\nthree weeks, and will wait on you, and receive thankfully on paper, and\r\nany verbal communications which you may be so good as to make to him. I\r\nmake no apology for this trouble, because I know that the same wish to\r\npromote science which has induced me to bring forward this proposition,\r\nwill induce you to aid in promoting it. Accept assurances of my friendly\r\nesteem and high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR HARRISON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 27, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--While at Monticello in August last I received your favor of\r\nAugust 8th, and meant to have acknowledged it on my return to the seat of\r\ngovernment at the close of the ensuing month, but on my return I found\r\nthat you were expected to be on here in person, and this expectation\r\ncontinued till winter. I have since received your favor of December 30th.\r\n\r\nIn the former you mentioned the plan of the town which you had done me the\r\nhonor to name after me, and to lay out according to an idea I had formerly\r\nexpressed to you. I am thoroughly persuaded that it will be found handsome\r\nand pleasant, and I do believe it to be the best means of preserving\r\nthe cities of America from the scourge of the yellow fever, which being\r\npeculiar to our country, must be derived from some peculiarity in it.\r\nThat peculiarity I take to be our cloudless skies. In Europe, where the\r\nsun does not shine more than half the number of days in the year which it\r\ndoes in America, they can build their town in a solid block with impunity;\r\nbut here a constant sun produces too great an accumulation of heat to\r\nadmit that. Ventilation is indispensably necessary. Experience has taught\r\nus that in the open air of the country the yellow fever is not only not\r\ngenerated, but ceases to be infectious. I cannot decide from the drawing\r\nyou sent me, whether you have laid off streets round the squares thus: or\r\nonly the diagonal streets therein marked. The former was my idea, and is,\r\nI imagine, most convenient.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:  Pattern of squares.]\r\n\r\nYou will receive herewith an answer to your letter as President of\r\nthe Convention; and from the Secretary of War you receive from time\r\nto time information and instructions as to our Indian affairs. These\r\ncommunications being for the public records, are restrained always to\r\nparticular objects and occasions; but this letter being unofficial and\r\nprivate, I may with safety give you a more extensive view of our policy\r\nrespecting the Indians, that you may the better comprehend the parts\r\ndealt out to you in detail through the official channel, and observing\r\nthe system of which they make a part, conduct yourself in unison with it\r\nin cases where you are obliged to act without instruction. Our system is\r\nto live in perpetual peace with the Indians, to cultivate an affectionate\r\nattachment from them, by everything just and liberal which we can do\r\nfor them within the bounds of reason, and by giving them effectual\r\nprotection against wrongs from our own people. The decrease of game\r\nrendering their subsistence by hunting insufficient, we wish to draw\r\nthem to agriculture, to spinning and weaving. The latter branches they\r\ntake up with great readiness, because they fall to the women, who gain\r\nby quitting the labors of the field for those which are exercised within\r\ndoors. When they withdraw themselves to the culture of a small piece of\r\nland, they will perceive how useless to them are their extensive forests,\r\nand will be willing to pare them off from time to time in exchange for\r\nnecessaries for their farms and families. To promote this disposition to\r\nexchange lands, which they have to spare and we want, for necessaries,\r\nwhich we have to spare and they want, we shall push our trading uses,\r\nand be glad to see the good and influential individuals among them run\r\nin debt, because we observe that when these debts get beyond what the\r\nindividuals can pay, they become willing to lop them off by a cession of\r\nlands. At our trading houses, too, we mean to sell so low as merely to\r\nrepay us cost and charges, so as neither to lessen or enlarge our capital.\r\nThis is what private traders cannot do, for they must gain; they will\r\nconsequently retire from the competition, and we shall thus get clear of\r\nthis pest without giving offence or umbrage to the Indians. In this way\r\nour settlements will gradually circumscribe and approach the Indians, and\r\nthey will in time either incorporate with us as citizens of the United\r\nStates, or remove beyond the Mississippi. The former is certainly the\r\ntermination of their history most happy for themselves; but, in the whole\r\ncourse of this, it is essential to cultivate their love. As to their\r\nfear, we presume that our strength and their weakness is now so visible\r\nthat they must see we have only to shut our hand to crush them, and that\r\nall our liberalities to them proceed from motives of pure humanity only.\r\nShould any tribe be fool-hardy enough to take up the hatchet at any time,\r\nthe seizing the whole country of that tribe, and driving them across\r\nthe Mississippi, as the only condition of peace, would be an example to\r\nothers, and a furtherance of our final consolidation.\r\n\r\nCombined with these views, and to be prepared against the occupation of\r\nLouisiana by a powerful and enterprising people, it is important that,\r\nsetting less value on interior extension of purchases from the Indians,\r\nwe bend our whole views to the purchase and settlement of the country\r\non the Mississippi, from its mouth to its northern regions, that we may\r\nbe able to present as strong a front on our western as on our eastern\r\nborder, and plant on the Mississippi itself the means of its own defence.\r\nWe now own from 31' to the Yazoo, and hope this summer to purchase what\r\nbelongs to the Choctaws from the Yazoo up to their boundary, supposed\r\nto be about opposite the mouth of Acanza. We wish at the same time\r\nto begin in your quarter, for which there is at present a favorable\r\nopening. The Cahokias extinct, we are entitled to their country by our\r\nparamount sovereignty. The Piorias, we understand, have all been driven\r\noff from their country, and we might claim it in the same way; but as we\r\nunderstand there is one chief remaining, who would, as the survivor of\r\nthe tribe, sell the right, it is better to give him such terms as will\r\nmake him easy for life, and take a conveyance from him. The Kaskaskias\r\nbeing reduced to a few families, I presume we may purchase their whole\r\ncountry for what would place every individual of them at his ease, and be\r\na small price to us,--say by laying off for each family, whenever they\r\nwould choose it, as much rich land as they could cultivate, adjacent to\r\neach other, enclosing the whole in a single fence, and giving them such\r\nan annuity in money or goods forever as would place them in happiness;\r\nand we might take them also under the protection of the United States.\r\nThus possessed of the rights of these tribes, we should proceed to the\r\nsettling their boundaries with the Poutewatamies and Kickapoos; claiming\r\nall doubtful territory, but paying them a price for the relinquishment\r\nof their concurrent claim, and even prevailing on them, if possible, to\r\n_cede_, for a price, such of their own unquestioned territory as would\r\ngive us a convenient northern boundary. Before broaching this, and while\r\nwe are bargaining with the Kaskaskies, the minds of the Poutewatamies and\r\nKickapoos should be soothed and conciliated by liberalities and sincere\r\nassurances of friendship. Perhaps by sending a well-qualified character\r\nto stay some time in Decoigne's village, as if on other business, and to\r\nsound him and introduce the subject by degrees to his mind and that of the\r\nother heads of families, inculcating in the way of conversation, all those\r\nconsiderations which prove the advantages they would receive by a cession\r\non these terms, the object might be more easily and effectually obtained\r\nthan by abruptly proposing it to them at a formal treaty. Of the means,\r\nhowever, of obtaining what we wish, you will be the best judge; and I\r\nhave given you this view of the system which we suppose will best promote\r\nthe interests of the Indians and ourselves, and finally consolidate our\r\nwhole country to one nation only; that you may be enabled the better\r\nto adapt your means to the object, for this purpose we have given you\r\na general commission for treating. The crisis is pressing: whatever can\r\nnow be obtained must be obtained quickly. The occupation of New Orleans,\r\nhourly expected, by the French, is already felt like a light breeze by the\r\nIndians. You know the sentiments they entertain of that nation; under the\r\nhope of their protection they will immediately stiffen against cessions of\r\nlands to us. We had better, therefore, do at once what can now be done.\r\n\r\nI must repeat that this letter is to be considered as private and\r\nfriendly, and is not to control any particular instructions which you may\r\nreceive through official channel. You will also perceive how sacredly it\r\nmust be kept within your own breast, and especially how improper to be\r\nunderstood by the Indians. For their interests and their tranquillity it\r\nis best they should see only the present age of their history. I pray you\r\nto accept assurances of my esteem and high consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DR. PRIESTLEY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, April 9, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--While on a short visit lately to Monticello, I received from\r\nyou a copy of your comparative view of Socrates and Jesus, and I avail\r\nmyself of the first moment of leisure after my return to acknowledge the\r\npleasure I had in the perusal of it, and the desire it excited to see\r\nyou take up the subject on a more extended scale. In consequence of some\r\nconversation with Dr. Rush, in the year 1798-99, I had promised some\r\nday to write him a letter giving him my view of the Christian system. I\r\nhave reflected often on it since, and even sketched the outlines in my\r\nown mind. I should first take a general view of the moral doctrines of\r\nthe most remarkable of the ancient philosophers, of whose ethics we have\r\nsufficient information to make an estimate, say Pythagoras, Epicurus,\r\nEpictetus, Socrates, Cicero, Seneca, Antoninus. I should do justice to the\r\nbranches of morality they have treated well; but point out the importance\r\nof those in which they are deficient. I should then take a view of the\r\ndeism and ethics of the Jews, and show in what a degraded state they were,\r\nand the necessity they presented of a reformation. I should proceed to\r\na view of the life, character, and doctrines of Jesus, who sensible of\r\nincorrectness of their ideas of the Deity, and of morality, endeavored\r\nto bring them to the principles of a pure deism, and juster notions of\r\nthe attributes of God, to reform their moral doctrines to the standard\r\nof reason, justice and philanthropy, and to inculcate the belief of a\r\nfuture state. This view would purposely omit the question of his divinity,\r\nand even his inspiration. To do him justice, it would be necessary to\r\nremark the disadvantages his doctrines had to encounter, not having been\r\ncommitted to writing by himself, but by the most unlettered of men, by\r\nmemory, long after they had heard them from him; when much was forgotten,\r\nmuch misunderstood, and presented in every paradoxical shape. Yet such\r\nare the fragments remaining as to show a master workman, and that his\r\nsystem of morality was the most benevolent and sublime probably that has\r\nbeen ever taught, and consequently more perfect than those of any of the\r\nancient philosophers. His character and doctrines have received still\r\ngreater injury from those who pretend to be his special disciples, and who\r\nhave disfigured and sophisticated his actions and precepts, from views\r\nof personal interest, so as to induce the unthinking part of mankind to\r\nthrow off the whole system in disgust, and to pass sentence as an impostor\r\non the most innocent, the most benevolent, the most eloquent and sublime\r\ncharacter that ever has been exhibited to man. This is the outline; but\r\nI have not the time, and still less the information which the subject\r\nneeds. It will therefore rest with me in contemplation only. You are the\r\nperson of all others would do it best, and most promptly. You have all the\r\nmaterials at hand, and you put together with ease. I wish you could be\r\ninduced to extend your late work to the whole subject. I have not heard\r\nparticularly what is the state of your health; but as it has been equal\r\nto the journey to Philadelphia, perhaps it might encourage the curiosity\r\nyou must feel to see for once this place, which nature has formed on a\r\nbeautiful scale, and circumstances destine for a great one. As yet we\r\nare but a cluster of villages; we cannot offer you the learned society\r\nof Philadelphia; but you will have that of a few characters whom you\r\nesteem, and a bed and hearty welcome with one who will rejoice in every\r\nopportunity of testifying to you his high veneration and affectionate\r\nattachment.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD DOWSE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 19, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I now return the sermon you were so kind as to enclose me,\r\nhaving perused it with attention. The reprinting it by me, as you have\r\nproposed, would very readily be ascribed to hypocritical affectation, by\r\nthose who, when they cannot blame our acts, have recourse to the expedient\r\nof imputing them to bad motives. This is a resource which can never fail\r\nthem, because there is no act, however virtuous, for which ingenuity may\r\nnot find some bad motive. I must also add that though I concur with the\r\nauthor in considering the moral precepts of Jesus as more pure, correct,\r\nand sublime than those of the ancient philosophers, yet I do not concur\r\nwith him in the mode of proving it. He thinks it necessary to libel and\r\ndecry the doctrines of the philosophers; but a man must be blinded indeed\r\nby prejudice, who can deny them a great degree of merit. I give them\r\ntheir just due, and yet maintain that the morality of Jesus, as taught by\r\nhimself, and freed from the corruptions of latter times, is far superior.\r\nTheir philosophy went chiefly to the government of our passions, so far\r\nas respected ourselves, and the procuring our own tranquillity. In our\r\nduties to others they were short and deficient. They extended their cares\r\nscarcely beyond our kindred and friends individually, and our country in\r\nthe abstract. Jesus embraced with charity and philanthropy our neighbors,\r\nour countrymen, and the whole family of mankind. They confined themselves\r\nto actions; he pressed his sentiments into the region of our thoughts, and\r\ncalled for purity at the fountain head. In a pamphlet lately published in\r\nPhiladelphia by Dr. Priestley, he has treated, with more justice and skill\r\nthan Mr. Bennet, a small portion of this subject. His is a comparative\r\nview of Socrates only with Jesus. I have urged him to take up the subject\r\non a broader scale.\r\n\r\nEvery word which goes from me, whether verbally or in writing, becomes the\r\nsubject of so much malignant distortion, and perverted construction, that\r\nI am obliged to caution my friends against admitting the possibility of\r\nmy letters getting into the public papers, or a copy of them to be taken\r\nunder any degree of confidence. The present one is perhaps of a tenor to\r\nsilence some calumniators, but I never will, by any word or act, bow to\r\nthe shrine of intolerance, or admit a right of inquiry into the religious\r\nopinions of others. On the contrary, we are bound, you, I, and every one,\r\nto make common cause, even with error itself, to maintain the common right\r\nof freedom of conscience. We ought with one heart and one hand to hew\r\ndown the daring and dangerous efforts of those who would seduce the public\r\nopinion to substitute itself into that tyranny over religious faith which\r\nthe laws have so justly abdicated. For this reason, were my opinions up to\r\nthe standard of those who arrogate the right of questioning them, I would\r\nnot countenance that arrogance by descending to an explanation. Accept my\r\nfriendly salutations and high esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                            April 21, 1803.\r\n\r\nThe Act of Congress 1789, c. 9, assumes on the General Government the\r\nmaintenance and repair of all lighthouses, beacons, buoys, and public\r\npiers then existing, and provides for the building a new lighthouse.\r\nThis was done under the authority given by the Constitution \"to regulate\r\ncommerce,\" was contested at the time as not within the meaning of these\r\nterms, and yielded to only on the urgent necessity of the case. The\r\nAct of 1802, c. 20, f. 8, for repairing and erecting public piers in\r\nthe Delaware, does not take any new ground--it is in strict conformity\r\nwith the Act of 1789. While we pursue, then, the construction of the\r\nLegislature, that the repairing and erecting lighthouses, beacons, buoys,\r\nand piers, is authorized as belonging to the regulation of commerce,\r\nwe must take care not to go ahead of them, and strain the meaning of\r\nthe terms still further to the clearing out the channels of all the\r\nrivers, &c. of the United States. The removing a sunken vessel is not the\r\nrepairing of a pier.\r\n\r\nHow far the authority \"to levy taxes to provide for the common defence,\"\r\nand that \"for providing and maintaining a navy,\" may authorize the\r\nremoving obstructions in a river or harbor, is a question not involved in\r\nthe present case.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 21, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In some of the delightful conversations with you, in the\r\nevenings of 1798-99, and which served as an anodyne to the afflictions\r\nof the crisis through which our country was then laboring, the Christian\r\nreligion was sometimes our topic; and I then promised you, that one day or\r\nother, I would give you my views of it. They are the result of a life of\r\ninquiry and reflection, and very different from that anti-Christian system\r\nimputed to me by those who know nothing of my opinions. To the corruptions\r\nof Christianity I am indeed opposed; but not to the genuine precepts of\r\nJesus himself. I am a Christian, in the only sense in which he wished\r\nany one to be; sincerely attached to his doctrines, in preference to all\r\nothers; ascribing to himself every _human_ excellence; and believing he\r\nnever claimed any other. At the short intervals since these conversations,\r\nwhen I could justifiably abstract my mind from public affairs, the subject\r\nhas been under my contemplation. But the more I considered it, the more\r\nit expanded beyond the measure of either my time or information. In\r\nthe moment of my late departure from Monticello, I received from Doctor\r\nPriestley, his little treatise of \"Socrates and Jesus compared.\" This\r\nbeing a section of the general view I had taken of the field, it became\r\na subject of reflection while on the road, and unoccupied otherwise.\r\nThe result was, to arrange in my mind a syllabus, or outline of such an\r\nestimate of the comparative merits of Christianity, as I wished to see\r\nexecuted by some one of more leisure and information for the task, than\r\nmyself. This I now send you, as the only discharge of my promise I can\r\nprobably ever execute. And in confiding it to you, I know it will not be\r\nexposed to the malignant perversions of those who make every word from me\r\na text for new misrepresentations and calumnies. I am moreover averse to\r\nthe communication of my religious tenets to the public; because it would\r\ncountenance the presumption of those who have endeavored to draw them\r\nbefore that tribunal, and to seduce public opinion to erect itself into\r\nthat inquisition over the rights of conscience, which the laws have so\r\njustly proscribed. It behoves every man who values liberty of conscience\r\nfor himself, to resist invasions of it in the case of others; or their\r\ncase may, by change of circumstances, become his own. It behoves him,\r\ntoo, in his own case, to give no example of concession, betraying the\r\ncommon right of independent opinion, by answering questions of faith,\r\nwhich the laws have left between God and himself. Accept my affectionate\r\nsalutations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Syllabus of an Estimate of the Merit of the Doctrines of Jesus, compared\r\nwith those of others._\r\n\r\nIn a comparative view of the Ethics of the enlightened nations of\r\nantiquity, of the Jews and of Jesus, no notice should be taken of the\r\ncorruptions of reason among the ancients, to wit, the idolatry and\r\nsuperstition of the vulgar, nor of the corruptions of Christianity by the\r\nlearned among its professors.\r\n\r\nLet a just view be taken of the moral principles inculcated by the most\r\nesteemed of the sects of ancient philosophy, or of their individuals;\r\nparticularly Pythagoras, Socrates, Epicurus, Cicero, Epictetus, Seneca,\r\nAntoninus.\r\n\r\nI.

In developing our duties to others, they were short and defective.\r\nThey embraced, indeed, the circles of kindred and friends, and inculcated\r\npatriotism, or the love of our country in the aggregate, as a primary\r\nobligation: towards our neighbors and countrymen they taught justice, but\r\nscarcely viewed them as within the circle of benevolence. Still less have\r\nthey inculcated peace, charity and love to our fellow men, or embraced\r\nwith benevolence the whole family of mankind.\r\n\r\nII. Jews. 1. Their system was Deism; that is, the belief in one only God.\r\nBut their ideas of him and of his attributes were degrading and injurious.\r\n\r\n2. Their Ethics were not only imperfect, but often irreconcilable with\r\nthe sound dictates of reason and morality, as they respect intercourse\r\nwith those around us; and repulsive and anti-social, as respecting other\r\nnations. They needed reformation, therefore, in an eminent degree.\r\n\r\nIII. Jesus. In this state of things among the Jews, Jesus appeared. His\r\nparentage was obscure; his condition poor; his education null; his natural\r\nendowments great; his life correct and innocent: he was meek, benevolent,\r\npatient, firm, disinterested, and of the sublimest eloquence.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantages under which his doctrines appear are remarkable.\r\n\r\n1. Like Socrates and Epictetus, he wrote nothing himself.\r\n\r\n2. But he had not, like them, a Xenophon or an Arrian to write for him. I\r\nname not Plato, who only used the name of Socrates to cover the whimsies\r\nof his own brain. On the contrary, all the learned of his country,\r\nentrenched in its power and riches, were opposed to him, lest his labors\r\nshould undermine their advantages; and the committing to writing his life\r\nand doctrines fell on unlettered and ignorant men; who wrote, too, from\r\nmemory, and not till long after the transactions had passed.\r\n\r\n3. According to the ordinary fate of those who attempt to enlighten and\r\nreform mankind, he fell an early victim to the jealousy and combination of\r\nthe altar and the throne, at about thirty-three years of age, his reason\r\nhaving not yet attained the _maximum_ of its energy, nor the course of his\r\npreaching, which was but of three years at most, presented occasions for\r\ndeveloping a complete system of morals.\r\n\r\n4. Hence the doctrines which he really delivered were defective as\r\na whole, and fragments only of what he did deliver have come to us\r\nmutilated, misstated, and often unintelligible.\r\n\r\n5. They have been still more disfigured by the corruptions of\r\nschismatizing followers, who have found an interest in sophisticating\r\nand perverting the simple doctrines he taught, by engrafting on them the\r\nmysticisms of a Grecian sophist, frittering them into subtleties, and\r\nobscuring them with jargon, until they have caused good men to reject the\r\nwhole in disgust, and to view Jesus himself as an impostor.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these disadvantages, a system of morals is presented to\r\nus, which, if filled up in the style and spirit of the rich fragments he\r\nleft us, would be the most perfect and sublime that has ever been taught\r\nby man.\r\n\r\nThe question of his being a member of the Godhead, or in direct\r\ncommunication with it, claimed for him by some of his followers, and\r\ndenied by others, is foreign to the present view, which is merely an\r\nestimate of the intrinsic merits of his doctrines.\r\n\r\n1. He corrected the Deism of the Jews, confirming them in their belief\r\nof one only God, and giving them juster notions of his attributes and\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n2. His moral doctrines, relating to kindred and friends, were more pure\r\nand perfect than those of the most correct of the philosophers, and\r\ngreatly more so than those of the Jews; and they went far beyond both\r\nin inculcating universal philanthropy, not only to kindred and friends,\r\nto neighbors and countrymen, but to all mankind, gathering all into one\r\nfamily, under the bonds of love, charity, peace, common wants and common\r\naids. A development of this head will evince the peculiar superiority of\r\nthe system of Jesus over all others.\r\n\r\n3. The precepts of philosophy, and of the Hebrew code, laid hold of\r\nactions only. He pushed his scrutinies into the heart of man; erected his\r\ntribunal in the region of his thoughts, and purified the waters at the\r\nfountain head.\r\n\r\n4. He taught, emphatically, the doctrines of a future state, which was\r\neither doubted, or disbelieved by the Jews; and wielded it with efficacy,\r\nas an important incentive, supplementary to the other motives to moral\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [17] To explain, I will exhibit the heads of Seneca's and\r\n         Cicero's philosophical works, the most extensive of any we have\r\n         received from the ancients. Of ten heads in Seneca, seven relate\r\n         to ourselves, viz. _de ira_, _consolatio_, _de tranquilitate_,\r\n         _de constantia sapientis_, _de otio sapientis_, _de vita beata_,\r\n         _de brevitate vitae_; two relate to others, _de elementia_, _de\r\n         beneficiis_; and one relates to the government of the world, _de\r\n         providentia_. Of eleven tracts of Cicero, five respect ourselves,\r\n         viz. _de finibus_, _Tusculana_, _academica_, _paradoxa_, _de\r\n         Senectute_; one, _de officiis_, relates partly to ourselves,\r\n         partly to others; one, _de amicitia_, relates to others; and\r\n         four are on different subjects, to wit, _de natura deorum_, _de\r\n         divinatione_, _de fato_, and _somnium Scipionis_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR HUGH WILLIAMSON.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, April 30, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I thank you for the information on the subject of navigation\r\nof the Herville contained in yours of the 10th. In running the late line\r\nbetween the Choctaws and us, we found the Amite to be about thirty miles\r\nfrom the Mississippi where that line crossed it, which was but a little\r\nnorthward of our southern boundary. For the present we have a respite on\r\nthat subject, Spain having without delay restored our infracted right,\r\nand assured us it is expressly saved by the instrument of her cession\r\nof Louisiana to France. Although I do not count with confidence on\r\nobtaining New Orleans from France for money, yet I am confident in the\r\npolicy of putting off the day of contention for it till we have lessened\r\nthe embarrassment of debt accumulated instead of being discharged by\r\nour predecessors, till we obtain more of that strength which is growing\r\non us so rapidly, and especially till we have planted a population on\r\nthe Mississippi itself sufficient to do its own work without marching\r\nmen fifteen hundred miles from the Atlantic shores to perish by fatigue\r\nand unfriendly climates. This will soon take place. In the meantime we\r\nhave obtained by a peaceable appeal to justice, in four months, what\r\nwe should not have obtained under seven years of war, the loss of one\r\nhundred thousand lives, an hundred millions of additional debt, many\r\nhundred millions worth of produce and property lost for want of market,\r\nor in seeking it, and that demoralization which war superinduces on the\r\nhuman mind. To have seized New Orleans, as our federal maniacs wished,\r\nwould only have changed the character and extent of the blockade of our\r\nwestern commerce. It would have produced a blockade, by superior naval\r\nforce, of the navigation of the river as well as of the entrance into\r\nNew Orleans, instead of a paper blockade from New Orleans alone while the\r\nriver remained open, and I am persuaded that had not the deposit been so\r\nquickly rendered we should have found soon that it would be better now to\r\nascend the river to Natchez, in order to be clear of the embarrassments,\r\nplunderings, and irritations at New Orleans, and to fatten by the benefits\r\nof the depôt a city and citizens of our own, rather than those of a\r\nforeign nation. Accept my friendly and respectful salutations.\r\n\r\nP. S. Water line of the Herville, Amite, and to Ponchartrain, becoming\r\na boundary between France and Spain, we have a double chance of an\r\nacknowledgment of our right to use it on the same ground of national right\r\non which we claim the navigation of the Mobile and other rivers heading in\r\nour territory and running through the Floridas.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR NICHOLSON.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 13, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I return you the letter of Captain Jones, with thanks for the\r\nperusal. While it is well to have an eye on our enemy's camp it is not\r\namiss to keep one for the movements in our own. I have no doubt that the\r\nagitation of the public mind on the continuance of tories in office is\r\nexcited in some degree by those who want to get in themselves. However,\r\nthe mass of those affected by it can have no views of that kind. It\r\nis composed of such of our friends as have a warm sense of the former\r\nintolerance and present bitterness of our adversaries, and they are not\r\nwithout excuse. While it is best for our own tranquillity to see and\r\nhear with apathy the atrocious calumnies of the presses which our enemies\r\nsupport for the purpose of calumny, it is what we have no right to expect;\r\nnor can we consider the indignation they excite in others as unjust, or\r\nstrongly censure those whose temperament is not proof against it. Nor\r\nare they protected in their places by any right they have to more than\r\na just proportion of them, and still less by their own examples while in\r\npower; but by considerations respecting the public mind. This tranquillity\r\nseems necessary to predispose the candid part of our fellow-citizens who\r\nhave erred and strayed from their ways, to return again to them, and\r\nto consolidate once more that union of will, without which the nation\r\nwill not stand firm against foreign force and intrigue. On the subject\r\nof the particular schism at Philadelphia, a well-informed friend says,\r\n\"The fretful, turbulent disposition which has manifested itself in\r\nPhiladelphia, originated, in some degree, from a sufficient cause, which I\r\nwill explain when I see you. A re-union will take place, and in the issue\r\nit will be useful. Their resolves will be so tempered as to remove most of\r\nthe unpleasant feelings which have been experienced.\" I shall certainly be\r\nglad to receive the explanation and modification of their proceedings; for\r\nthey were taking a form which could not be approved on true principles.\r\nWe laid down our line of proceedings on mature inquiry and consideration\r\nin 1801, and have not departed from it. Some removals, to wit, sixteen to\r\nthe end of our first session of Congress were made on political principles\r\nalone, in very urgent cases; and we determined to make no more but for\r\ndelinquency, or active and bitter opposition to the order of things\r\nwhich the public will had established. On this last ground nine were\r\nremoved from the end of the first to the end of the second session of\r\nCongress; and one since that. So that sixteen only have been removed in\r\nthe whole for political principles, that is to say, to make room for some\r\nparticipation for the republicans. These were a mere fraud not suffered\r\nto go into effect. Pursuing our object of harmonizing all good people of\r\nwhatever description, we shall steadily adhere to our rule, and it is with\r\nsincere pleasure I learn that it is approved by the more moderate part of\r\nour friends.\r\n\r\nWe have received official information that, in the instrument of cession\r\nof Louisiana to France, were these words, \"Saving the rights acquired by\r\nother powers in virtue of treaties made with them by Spain;\" and cordial\r\nacknowledgments from this power for our temperate forbearance under the\r\nmisconduct of her officer. The French prefect too has assured Governor\r\nClaiborne that if the suspension is not removed before he takes his place\r\nhe will remove it. But the Spanish Intendant has before this day received\r\nthe positive order of his government to do it, sent here by a vessel of\r\nwar, and forwarded by us to Natchez.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is probably no truth in the stories of war actually\r\ncommenced, yet I believe it inevitable. England insists on a\r\nre-modification of the affairs of Europe, so much changed by Bonaparte\r\nsince the treaty of Amiens. So that we may soon expect to hear of\r\nhostilities. You must have heard of the extraordinary charge of Chace to\r\nthe Grand Jury at Baltimore. Ought this seditious and official attack on\r\nthe principles of our Constitution, and on the proceedings of a State, to\r\ngo unpunished? and to whom so pointedly as yourself will the public look\r\nfor the necessary measures? I ask these questions for your consideration,\r\nfor myself it is better that I should not interfere. Accept my friendly\r\nsalutations and assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 24, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The within being for communication to your House of\r\nRepresentatives, when it meets, I enclose it in this which is of a private\r\ncharacter. The former I think had better be kept up until the meeting\r\nof the Representatives, lest it should have any effect on the present\r\ncritical state of things beyond the Atlantic. Although I have endeavored\r\nto make it as inoffensive there as was compatible with the giving an\r\nanswer to the Representatives. Pending a negotiation, and with a jealous\r\npower, small matters may excite alarm, and repugnance to what we are\r\nclaiming. I consider war between France and England as unavoidable. The\r\nformer is much averse to it, but the latter sees her own existence to\r\ndepend on a remodification of the face of Europe, over which France has\r\nextended its sway much farther since than before the treaty of Amiens.\r\nThat instrument is therefore considered as insufficient for the general\r\nsecurity; in fact, as virtually subverted, by the subsequent usurpations\r\nof Bonaparte on the powers of Europe. A remodification is therefore\r\nrequired by England, and evidently cannot be agreed to by Bonaparte, whose\r\npower, resting on the transcendent opinion entertained of him, would sink\r\nwith that on any retrograde movement. In this conflict, our neutrality\r\nwill be cheaply purchased by a cession of the island of New Orleans and\r\nthe Floridas; because taking part in the war, we could so certainly seize\r\nand securely hold them and more. And although it would be unwise in us\r\nto let such an opportunity pass by of obtaining the necessary accession\r\nto our territory even by force, if not obtainable otherwise, yet it is\r\ninfinitely more desirable to obtain it with the blessing of neutrality\r\nrather than the curse of war. As a means of increasing the security, and\r\nproviding a protection for our lower possessions on the Mississippi, I\r\nthink it also all important to press on the Indians, as steadily and\r\nstrenuously as they can bear, the extension of our purchases on the\r\nMississippi from the Yazoo upwards; and to encourage a settlement along\r\nthe whole length of that river, that it may possess on its own banks the\r\nmeans of defending itself, and presenting as strong a frontier on our\r\nwestern as we have on our eastern border. We have therefore recommended\r\nto Governor Dickinson taking on the Tombigbee only as much as will cover\r\nour actual settlements, to transfer the purchase from the Choctaws to\r\ntheir lands westward of the Big Black, rather than the fork of Tombigbee\r\nand Alabama, which has been offered by them in order to pay their debt\r\nto Ponton and Leslie. I have confident expectations of purchasing this\r\nsummer a good breadth on the Mississippi, from the mouth of the Illinois\r\ndown to the mouth of the Ohio, which would settle immediately and thickly;\r\nand we should then have between that settlement and the lower one, only\r\nthe uninhabited lands of the Chickasaws on the Mississippi; on which we\r\ncould be working at both ends. You will be sensible that the preceding\r\nviews, as well those which respect the European powers as the Indians,\r\nare such as should not be formally declared, but be held as a rule of\r\naction to govern the conduct of those within whose agency they lie; and it\r\nis for this reason that instead of having it said to you in an official\r\nletter, committed to records which are open to many, I have thought it\r\nbetter that you should learn my views from a private and confidential\r\nletter, and be enabled to act upon them yourself, and guide others into\r\nthem. The elections which have taken place this spring, prove that the\r\nspirit of republicanism has repossessed the whole mass of our country from\r\nConnecticut southwardly and westwardly. The three New England States of\r\nNew Hampshire, Massachusetts and Connecticut, alone hold out. In these,\r\nthough we have not gained the last year as much as we had expected, yet\r\nwe are gaining steadily and sensibly. In Massachusetts we have gained\r\nthree senators more than we had the last year, and it is believed our gain\r\nin the lower House will be in proportion. In Connecticut we have rather\r\nlost in their Legislature, but in the mass of the people, where we had\r\non the election of Governor the last year, but twenty-nine republican\r\nout of every hundred votes, we this year have thirty-five out of every\r\nhundred; with the phalanx of priests and lawyers against us, republicanism\r\nworks up slowly in that quarter; but in a year or two more we shall have\r\na majority even there. In the next House of Representatives there will\r\nbe about forty-two federal and a hundred republican members. Be assured\r\nthat, excepting in this north-eastern and your south-western corner of\r\nthe Union, monarchism, which has been so falsely miscalled federalism,\r\nis dead and buried, and no day of resurrection will ever dawn upon that;\r\nthat it has retired to the two extreme and opposite angles of our land,\r\nfrom whence it will have ultimately and shortly to take its final flight.\r\nWhile speaking of the Indians, I omitted to mention that I think it would\r\nbe good policy in us to take by the hand those of them who have emigrated\r\nfrom ours to the other side of the Mississippi, to furnish them generously\r\nwith arms, ammunition, and other essentials, with a view to render a\r\nsituation there desirable to those they have left behind, to toll them\r\nin this way across the Mississippi, and thus prepare in time an eligible\r\nretreat for the whole. We have not as yet however began to act on this.\r\nI believe a considerable number from all the four southern tribes have\r\nsettled between the St. Francis and Akanza, but mostly from the Cherokees.\r\nI presume that with a view to this object we ought to establish a factory\r\non the eastern bank of the Mississippi, where it would be most convenient\r\nfor them to come and trade. We have an idea of running a path in a direct\r\nline from Knoxville to Natchez, believing it would save 200 miles in the\r\ncarriage of our mail. The consent of the Indians will be necessary, and it\r\nwill be very important to get individuals among them to take each a white\r\nman into partnership, and to establish at every nineteen miles a house\r\nof entertainment, and a farm for its support. The profits of this would\r\nsoon reconcile the Indians to the practice, and extend it, and render the\r\npublic use of the road as much an object of desire as it is now of fear;\r\nand such a horsepath would soon, with their consent, become a wagon-road.\r\nI have appointed Isaac Briggs of Maryland, surveyor of the lands south of\r\nTennessee. He is a Quaker, a sound republican, and of a pure and unspotted\r\ncharacter. In point of science, in astronomy, geometry and mathematics,\r\nhe stands in a line with Mr. Ellicot, and second to no man in the United\r\nStates. He set out yesterday for his destination, and I recommend him\r\nto your particular patronage; the candor, modesty and simplicity of his\r\nmanners cannot fail to gain your esteem. For the office of surveyor, men\r\nof the first order of science in astronomy and mathematics are essentially\r\nnecessary. I am about appointing a similar character for the north-western\r\ndepartment, and charging him with determining by celestial observations\r\nthe longitude and latitude of several interesting points of lakes\r\nMichigan and Superior, and an accurate survey of the Mississippi, from St.\r\nAnthony's Falls to the mouth of the Ohio, correcting his admeasurements\r\nby observations of longitude and latitude. From your quarter Mr. Briggs\r\nwill be expected to take accurate observations of such interesting points\r\nas Mr. Ellicot has omitted, so that it will not be long before we shall\r\npossess an accurate map of the outlines of the United States. Your country\r\nis so abundant in everything which is good, that one does not know what\r\nthere is here of that description which you have not, and which could be\r\noffered in exchange for a barrel of fresh peccans every autumn. Yet I will\r\nventure to propose such an exchange, taking information of the article\r\nmost acceptable from home, either from yourself or such others as can\r\ninform me. I pray you to accept my friendly salutations and assurances of\r\ngreat esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SIR JOHN SINCLAIR.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 30, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--It is so long since I have had the pleasure of writing to you,\r\nthat it would be vain to look back to dates to connect the old and the\r\nnew. Yet I ought not to pass over my acknowledgments to you for various\r\npublications received from time to time, and with great satisfaction\r\nand thankfulness. I send you a small one in return, the work of a very\r\nunlettered farmer, yet valuable, as it relates plain facts of importance\r\nto farmers. You will discover that Mr. Binns is an enthusiast for the\r\nuse of gypsum. But there are two facts which prove he has a right to be\r\nso: 1. He began poor, and has made himself tolerably rich by his farming\r\nalone. 2. The county of Loudon, in which he lives, had been so exhausted\r\nand wasted by bad husbandry, that it began to depopulate, the inhabitants\r\ngoing Southwardly in quest of better lands. Binns' success has stopped\r\nthat emigration. It is now becoming one of the most productive counties\r\nof the State of Virginia, and the price given for the lands is multiplied\r\nmanifold.\r\n\r\nWe are still uninformed here whether you are again at war. Bonaparte\r\nhas produced such a state of things in Europe as it would seem difficult\r\nfor him to relinquish in any sensible degree, and equally dangerous for\r\nGreat Britain to suffer to go on, especially if accompanied by maritime\r\npreparations on his part. The events which have taken place in France\r\nhave lessened in the American mind the motives of interest which it felt\r\nin that revolution, and its amity towards that country now rests on its\r\nlove of peace and commerce. We see, at the same time, with great concern,\r\nthe position in which Great Britain is placed, and should be sincerely\r\nafflicted were any disaster to deprive mankind of the benefit of such a\r\nbulwark against the torrent which has for some time been bearing down all\r\nbefore it. But her power and powers at sea seem to render everything safe\r\nin the end. Peace is our passion, and the wrongs might drive us from it.\r\nWe prefer trying _ever_ other just principles, right and safety, before we\r\nwould recur to war.\r\n\r\nI hope your agricultural institution goes on with success. I consider\r\nyou as the author of all the good it shall do. A better idea has never\r\nbeen carried into practice. Our agricultural society has at length\r\nformed itself. Like our American Philosophical Society, it is voluntary,\r\nand unconnected with the public, and is precisely an execution of the\r\nplan I formerly sketched to you. Some State societies have been formed\r\nheretofore; the others will do the same. Each State society names two\r\nof its members of Congress to be their members in the Central society,\r\nwhich is of course together during the sessions of Congress. They are to\r\nselect matter from the proceedings of the State societies, and to publish\r\nit; so that their publications may be called _l'esprit des sociétes\r\nd'agriculture_, &c. The Central society was formed the last winter only,\r\nso that it will be some time before they get under way. Mr. Madison, the\r\nSecretary of State, was elected their President.\r\n\r\nRecollecting with great satisfaction our friendly intercourse while I was\r\nin Europe, I nourish the hope it still preserves a place in your mind;\r\nand with my salutations, I pray you to accept assurances of my constant\r\nattachment and high respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN MERIWETHER LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                        WASHINGTON, United States of America, July 4, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In the journey which you are about to undertake, for the\r\ndiscovery of the course and source of the Missouri, and of the most\r\nconvenient water communication from thence to the Pacific Ocean,\r\nyour party being small, it is to be expected that you will encounter\r\nconsiderable dangers from the Indian inhabitants. Should you escape those\r\ndangers, and reach the Pacific Ocean, you may find it imprudent to hazard\r\na return the same way, and be forced to seek a passage round by sea, in\r\nsuch vessels as you may find on the Western coast; but you will be without\r\nmoney, without clothes, and other necessaries, as a sufficient supply\r\ncannot be carried from hence. Your resource, in that case, can only be in\r\nthe credit of the United States; for which purpose I hereby authorize you\r\nto draw on the Secretaries of State, of the Treasury, of War, and of the\r\nNavy of the United States, according as you may find your draughts will\r\nbe most negociable, for the purpose of obtaining money or necessaries for\r\nyourself and men; and I solemnly pledge the faith of the United States,\r\nthat these draughts shall be paid punctually at the date at which they are\r\nmade payable. I also ask of the consuls, agents, merchants, and citizens\r\nof any nation with which we have intercourse or amity, to furnish you\r\nwith those supplies which your necessities may call for, assuring them\r\nof honorable and prompt retribution; and our own consuls in foreign\r\nparts, where you may happen to be, are hereby instructed and required\r\nto be aiding and assisting to you in whatsoever may be necessary for\r\nprocuring your return back to the United States. And to give more entire\r\nsatisfaction and confidence to those who may be disposed to aid you, I,\r\nThomas Jefferson, President of the United States of America, have written\r\nthis letter of general credit for you with my own hand, and signed it with\r\nmy name.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EARL OF BUCHAN.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 10, 1803.\r\n\r\nMY LORD,--I received, through the hands of Mr. Lenox, on his return\r\nto the United States, the valuable volume you were so good as to send\r\nme on the life and writings of Fletcher, of Saltoun. The political\r\nprinciples of that patriot were worthy the purest periods of the British\r\nConstitution; they are those which were in vigor at the epoch of the\r\nAmerican emigration. Our ancestors brought them here, and they needed\r\nlittle strengthening to make us what we are. But in the weakened condition\r\nof English whigism at this day, it requires more firmness to publish and\r\nadvocate them than it then did to act on them. This merit is peculiarly\r\nyour Lordship's; and no one honors it more than myself. While I freely\r\nadmit the right of a nation to change its political principles and\r\nconstitution at will, and the impropriety of any but its own citizens\r\ncensuring that change, I expect your Lordship has been disappointed,\r\nas I acknowledge I have been, in the issue of the convulsions on the\r\nother side the channel. This has certainly lessened the interest which\r\nthe philanthropist warmly felt in those struggles. Without befriending\r\nhuman liberty, a gigantic force has risen up which seems to threaten the\r\nworld. But it hangs on the thread of opinion, which may break from one\r\nday to another. I feel real anxiety on the conflict to which imperious\r\ncircumstances seem to call your nation, and bless the Almighty Being, who,\r\nin gathering together the waters under the heavens into one place, divided\r\nthe dry land of your hemisphere from the dry lands of ours, and said, at\r\nleast be there peace. I hope that peace and amity with all nations will\r\nlong be the character of our land, and that its prosperity under the\r\nCharter will react on the mind of Europe, and profit her by the example.\r\nMy hope of preserving peace for our country is not founded in the greater\r\nprinciples of non-resistance under every wrong, but in the belief that a\r\njust and friendly conduct on our part will procure justice and friendship\r\nfrom others. In the existing contest, each of the combatants will find\r\nan interest in our friendship. I cannot say we shall be unconcerned\r\nspectators of this combat. We feel for human sufferings, and we wish the\r\ngood of all. We shall look on, therefore, with the sensations which these\r\ndispositions and the events of the war will produce.\r\n\r\nI feel a pride in the justice which your Lordship's sentiments render to\r\nthe character of my illustrious countryman, Washington. The moderation of\r\nhis desires, and the strength of his judgment, enabled him to calculate\r\ncorrectly, that the road to that glory which never dies is to use power\r\nfor the support of the laws and liberties of our country, not for their\r\ndestruction; and his will accordingly survives the wreck of everything now\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nAccept, my lord, the tribute of esteem, from one who renders it with\r\nwarmth to the disinterested friend of mankind, and assurances of my high\r\nconsideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GENERAL GATES.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 11, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR GENERAL,--I accept with pleasure, and with pleasure reciprocate your\r\ncongratulations on the acquisition of Louisiana; for it is a subject\r\nof mutual congratulation, as it interests every man of the nation. The\r\nterritory acquired, as it includes all the waters of the Missouri and\r\nMississippi, has more than doubled the area of the United States, and\r\nthe new parts is not inferior to the old in soil, climate, productions\r\nand important communications. If our Legislature dispose of it with the\r\nwisdom we have a right to expect, they may make it the means of tempting\r\nall our Indians on the east side of the Mississippi to remove to the\r\nwest, and of condensing instead of scattering our population. I find our\r\nopposition is very willing to pluck feathers from Monroe, although not\r\nfond of sticking them into Livingston's coat. The truth is, both have a\r\njust portion of merit; and were it necessary or proper, it would be shown\r\nthat each has rendered peculiar services, and of important value. These\r\ngrumblers, too, are very uneasy lest the administration should share some\r\nlittle credit for the acquisition, the whole of which they ascribe to the\r\naccident of war. They would be cruelly mortified could they see our files\r\nfrom May, 1801, the first organization of the administration, but more\r\nespecially from April, 1802. They would see, that though we could not say\r\nwhen war would arise, yet we said with energy what would take place when\r\nit should arise. We did not, by our intrigues, produce the war; but we\r\navailed ourselves of it when it happened. The other party saw the case now\r\nexisting, on which our representations were predicated, and the wisdom of\r\ntimely sacrifice. But when these people make the war give us everything,\r\nthey authorize us to ask what the war gave us in their day? They had a\r\nwar; what did they make it bring us? Instead of making our neutrality\r\nthe ground of gain to their country, they were for plunging into the\r\nwar. And if they were now in place, they would now be at war against the\r\natheists and disorganizers of France. They were for making their country\r\nan appendage to England. We are friendly, cordially and conscientiously\r\nfriendly to England. We are not hostile to France. We will be rigorously\r\njust and sincerely friendly to both. I do not believe we shall have as\r\nmuch to swallow from them as our predecessors had.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Gates, and accept yourself my affectionate\r\nsalutations, and assurances of great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. CABANIS.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 12, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I lately received your friendly letter of 28 Vendem. an. 11,\r\nwith the two volumes on the relations between the physical and moral\r\nfaculties of man. This has ever been a subject of great interest to\r\nthe inquisitive mind, and it could not have got into better hands for\r\ndiscussion than yours. That thought may be a faculty of our material\r\norganization, has been believed in the gross; and though the \"modus\r\noperandi\" of nature, in this, as in most other cases, can never be\r\ndeveloped and demonstrated to beings limited as we are, yet I feel\r\nconfident you will have conducted us as far on the road as we can go, and\r\nhave lodged us within reconnoitering distance of the citadel itself. While\r\n_here_, I have time to read nothing. But our annual recess for the months\r\nof August and September is now approaching, during which time I shall be\r\nat the Montrials, where I anticipate great satisfaction in the presence\r\nof these volumes. It is with great satisfaction, too, I recollect the\r\nagreeable hours I have past with yourself and M. de La Roche, at the house\r\nof our late excellent friend, Madame Helvetius, and elsewhere; and I am\r\nhappy to learn you continue your residence there. Antevil always appeared\r\nto me a delicious village, and Madame Helvetius's the most delicious\r\nspot in it. In those days how sanguine we were! and how soon were the\r\nvirtuous hopes and confidence of every good man blasted! and how many\r\nexcellent friends have we lost in your efforts towards self-government,\r\n_et cui bono?_ But let us draw a veil over the dead, and hope the best\r\nfor the living. If the hero who has saved you from a combination of\r\nenemies, shall also be the means of giving you as great a portion of\r\nliberty as the opinions, habits and character of the nation are prepared\r\nfor, progressive preparation may fit you for progressive portions of that\r\nfirst of blessings, and you may in time attain what we erred in supposing\r\ncould be hastily seized and maintained, in the present state of political\r\ninformation among your citizens at large. In this way all may end well.\r\n\r\nYou are again at war, I find. But we, I hope, shall be permitted to run\r\nthe race of peace. Your government has wisely removed what certainly\r\nendangered collision between us. I now see nothing which need ever\r\ninterrupt the friendship between France and this country. Twenty years\r\nof peace, and the prosperity so visibly flowing from it, have but\r\nstrengthened our attachment to it, and the blessings it brings, and we do\r\nnot despair of being always a peaceable nation. We think that peaceable\r\nmeans may be devised of keeping nations in the path of justice towards\r\nus, by making justice their interest, and injuries to react on themselves.\r\nOur distance enables us to pursue a course which the crowded situation of\r\nEurope renders perhaps impracticable there.\r\n\r\nBe so good as to accept for yourself and M. de La Roche, my friendly\r\nsalutations, and assurances of great consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DANIEL CLARKE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 17, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--You will be informed by a letter from the Secretary of State\r\nof the terms and the extent of the cession of Louisiana by France to the\r\nUnited States, a cession which I hope will give as much satisfaction to\r\nthe inhabitants of that province as it does to us, and the more as the\r\ntitle being lawfully acquired and with consent of the power conveying,\r\ncan never be hereafter reclaimed under any pretense of force. In order to\r\nprocure a ratification in good time, I have found it necessary to convene\r\nCongress as early as the 17th of October. It is essential that before\r\nthat period we should obtain all the information respecting the province\r\nwhich may be necessary to enable Congress to make the best arrangements\r\nfor its tranquillity, security and government. It is only on the spot that\r\nthis information can be obtained, and to obtain it there, I am obliged\r\nto ask your agency; for this purpose I have proposed a set of questions,\r\nnow enclosed, answers to which in the most exact terms practicable, I\r\nam to ask you to procure. It is probable you may be able to answer some\r\nof them yourself; however, it will doubtless be necessary for you to\r\ndistribute them among the different persons best qualified to answer them\r\nrespectively. As you will not have above six weeks, from the receipt of\r\nthem till they should be sent off to be here by the meeting of Congress,\r\nit will be the more necessary to employ different persons on different\r\nparts of them. This is left to your own judgment, and your best exertions\r\nto obtain them in time are desired. You will be so good as to engage the\r\npersons who undertake them, to complete them in time, and to accept such\r\nrecompense as you shall think reasonable, which shall be paid on your\r\ndraft on the Secretary of State. We rely that the friendly dispositions\r\nof the Spanish government will give such access to the archives of the\r\nprovince as may facilitate information, equally desirable by Spain on\r\nparting with her ancient subjects, as by us on receiving them. This favor\r\ntherefore will, I doubt not, be granted on your respectful application.\r\n\r\nAccept my salutations and assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. BRECKENRIDGE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 12, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The enclosed letter, though directed to you, was intended to\r\nme also, and was left open with a request, that when forwarded, I would\r\nforward it to you. It gives me occasion to write a word to you on the\r\nsubject of Louisiana, which being a new one, an interchange of sentiments\r\nmay produce correct ideas before we are to act on them.\r\n\r\nOur information as to the country is very incomplete; we have taken\r\nmeasures to obtain it full as to the settled part, which I hope to receive\r\nin time for Congress. The boundaries, which I deem not admitting question,\r\nare the high lands on the western side of the Mississippi enclosing all\r\nits waters, the Missouri of course, and terminating in the line drawn from\r\nthe northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods to the nearest source of\r\nthe Mississippi, as lately settled between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates. We have some claims, to extend on the sea coast westwardly to\r\nthe Rio Norte or Bravo, and better, to go eastwardly to the Rio Perdido,\r\nbetween Mobile and Pensacola, the ancient boundary of Louisiana. These\r\nclaims will be a subject of negotiation with Spain, and if, as soon as\r\nshe is at war, we push them strongly with one hand, holding out a price in\r\nthe other, we shall certainly obtain the Floridas, and all in good time.\r\nIn the meanwhile, without waiting for permission, we shall enter into the\r\nexercise of the natural right we have always insisted on with Spain, to\r\nwit, that of a nation holding the upper part of streams, having a right of\r\ninnocent passage through them to the ocean. We shall prepare her to see us\r\npractise on this, and she will not oppose it by force.\r\n\r\nObjections are raising to the eastward against the vast extent of our\r\nboundaries, and propositions are made to exchange Louisiana, or a part\r\nof it, for the Floridas. But, as I have said, we shall get the Floridas\r\nwithout, and I would not give one inch of the waters of the Mississippi\r\nto any nation, because I see in a light very important to our peace the\r\nexclusive right to its navigation, and the admission of no nation into\r\nit, but as into the Potomac or Delaware, with our consent and under\r\nour police. These federalists see in this acquisition the formation\r\nof a new confederacy, embracing all the waters of the Mississippi, on\r\nboth sides of it, and a separation of its eastern waters from us. These\r\ncombinations depend on so many circumstances which we cannot foresee,\r\nthat I place little reliance on them. We have seldom seen neighborhood\r\nproduce affection among nations. The reverse is almost the universal\r\ntruth. Besides, if it should become the great interest of those nations\r\nto separate from this, if their happiness should depend on it so strongly\r\nas to induce them to go through that convulsion, why should the Atlantic\r\nStates dread it? But especially why should we, their present inhabitants,\r\ntake side in such a question? When I view the Atlantic States, procuring\r\nfor those on the eastern waters of the Mississippi friendly instead of\r\nhostile neighbors on its western waters, I do not view it as an Englishman\r\nwould the procuring future blessings for the French nation, with whom\r\nhe has no relations of blood or affection. The future inhabitants of\r\nthe Atlantic and Mississippi States will be our sons. We leave them in\r\ndistinct but bordering establishments. We think we see their happiness\r\nin their union, and we wish it. Events may prove it otherwise; and if\r\nthey see their interest in separation, why should we take side with our\r\nAtlantic rather than our Mississippi descendants? It is the elder and the\r\nyounger son differing. God bless them both, and keep them in union, if it\r\nbe for their good, but separate them, if it be better. The inhabited part\r\nof Louisiana, from Point Coupée to the sea, will of course be immediately\r\na territorial government, and soon a State. But above that, the best use\r\nwe can make of the country for some time, will be to give establishments\r\nin it to the Indians on the east side of the Mississippi, in exchange for\r\ntheir present country, and open land offices in the last, and thus make\r\nthis acquisition the means of filling up the eastern side, instead of\r\ndrawing off its population. When we shall be full on this side, we may lay\r\noff a range of States on the western bank from the head to the mouth, and\r\nso, range after range, advancing compactly as we multiply.\r\n\r\nThis treaty must of course be laid before both Houses, because both\r\nhave important functions to exercise respecting it. They, I presume,\r\nwill see their duty to their country in ratifying and paying for it,\r\nso as to secure a good which would otherwise probably be never again\r\nin their power. But I suppose they must then appeal to _the nation_ for\r\nan additional article to the Constitution, approving and confirming an\r\nact which the nation had not previously authorized. The Constitution\r\nhas made no provision for our holding foreign territory, still less for\r\nincorporating foreign nations into our Union. The executive in seizing\r\nthe fugitive occurrence which so much advances the good of their country,\r\nhave done an act beyond the Constitution. The Legislature in casting\r\nbehind them metaphysical subtleties, and risking themselves like faithful\r\nservants, must ratify and pay for it, and throw themselves on their\r\ncountry for doing for them unauthorized, what we know they would have done\r\nfor themselves had they been in a situation to do it. It is the case of\r\na guardian, investing the money of his ward in purchasing an important\r\nadjacent territory; and saying to him when of age, I did this for your\r\ngood; I pretend to no right to bind you: you may disavow me, and I must\r\nget out of the scrape as I can: I thought it my duty to risk myself\r\nfor you. But we shall not be disavowed by the nation, and their act of\r\nindemnity will confirm and not weaken the Constitution, by more strongly\r\nmarking out its lines.\r\n\r\nWe have nothing later from Europe than the public papers give. I hope\r\nyourself and all the western members will make a sacred point of being at\r\nthe first day of the meeting of Congress; for _vestra res regitur_.\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations and assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 25, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your two favors of the 18th and 20th were received on the\r\n21st. The letters of Livingston and Monroe were sent to Mr. Gallatin as\r\nyou proposed. That of Simpson to Mr. Smith for the purpose of execution.\r\nAll of them will be returned. Thornton's, Clarke's, Charles's, Picnau's,\r\nAppleton's, Davis's, Newton's, and Dericure's letters are now enclosed.\r\nWith respect to the impressment of our seamen I think we had better\r\npropose to Great Britain to act on the stipulations which had been\r\nagreed to between that Government and Mr. King, as if they had been\r\nsigned. I think they were, that they would forbid impressments at sea,\r\nand that we should acquiesce in the search in their harbors necessary\r\nto prevent concealments of their citizens. Mr. Thornton's attempt to\r\njustify his nation in using our ports as cruising stations on our friends\r\nand ourselves, renders the matter so serious as to call, I think, for\r\nanswer. That we ought, in courtesy and friendship, to extend to them\r\nall the rights of hospitality is certain, that they should not use our\r\nhospitality to injure our friends or ourselves is equally enjoined by\r\nmorality and honor. After the rigorous exertions we made in Genet's time\r\nto prevent this abuse on his part, and the indulgencies extended by Mr.\r\nAdams to the British cruisers even after our pacification with France,\r\nby ourselves also from an unwillingness to change the course of things\r\nas the war was near its close, I did not expect to hear from that quarter\r\ncharges of partiality. In the Mediterranean we need ask from no nation but\r\nthe permission to refresh and repair in their ports. We do not wish our\r\nvessels to lounge in their ports. In the case at Gibraltar, if they had\r\ndisapproved, our vessels ought to have left the port. Besides, although\r\nnations have treated with the piratical States, they have not, in malice,\r\never been considered as entitled to all the favors of the laws of nations.\r\nThornton says they watch our trade only to prevent contraband. We say it\r\nis to plunder under pretext of contraband, for which, though so shamefully\r\nexercised, they have given us no satisfaction but by confessing the\r\nfact in new modifying their courts of Admiralty. Certainly the evils we\r\nexperience from it, and the just complaints which France may urge, render\r\nit indispensable that we restrain the English from abusing the rights of\r\nhospitality to their prejudice as well as our own.\r\n\r\nGraham's letter manifests a degree of imprudence, which I had not expected\r\nfrom him. His pride has probably been hurt at some of the regulations of\r\nthat court, and has had its part in inspiring the ill temper he shows.\r\nIf you understand him as serious in asking leave to return, I see no\r\ngreat objection to it. At the date of your letter you had not received\r\nmine on the subject of Dovieux's claim. I still think the limits therein\r\nstated reasonable. I think a guinea a day till he leaves Washington would\r\nbe as low an allowance as we could justify, and should not be opposed\r\nto anything not exceeding the allowance to Dawson. Fix between these as\r\nyou please. I suppose Monroe will touch on the limits of Louisiana only\r\nincidentally, inasmuch as its extension to Perdido curtails Florida, and\r\nrenders it of less worth. I have used my spare moments to investigate,\r\nby the help of my books here, the subject of the limits of Louisiana. I\r\nam satisfied our right to the Perdido is substantial, and can be opposed\r\nby a quibble on form only; and our right westwardly to the Bay of St.\r\nBernard, may be strongly maintained. I will use the first leisure to make\r\na statement of the facts and principles on which this depends. Further\r\nreflection on the amendment to the Constitution necessary in the case of\r\nLouisiana, satisfies me it will be better to give general powers, with\r\nspecified exceptions, somewhat in the way stated below. Mrs. Madison\r\npromised us a visit about the last of this month. I wish you could\r\nhave met with General Page here, whom, with his family, I expect in a\r\nday or two, and will pass a week with us. But in this consult your own\r\nconvenience, as that will increase the pleasure with which I shall or may\r\nsee you here. Accept my affectionate salutations and constant attachment.\r\n\r\nP. S. Louisiana, as ceded by France to the United States, is made a\r\npart of the United States. Its white inhabitants shall be citizens, and\r\nstand, as to their rights and obligations, on the same footing with other\r\ncitizens of the United States in analogous situations.\r\n\r\nSave only that as to the portion thereof lying north of the latitude\r\nof the mouth of Oreansa river, no new State shall be established, nor\r\nany grants of land made therein, other than to Indians, in exchange for\r\nequivalent portions of land occupied by them, until amendment to the\r\nConstitution shall be made for these purposes.\r\n\r\nFlorida also, whensoever it may be rightfully obtained, shall become\r\na part of the United States. Its white inhabitants shall thereupon be\r\ncitizens, and shall stand, as to their rights and obligations, on the\r\nsame footing with other citizens of the United States in analogous\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LEVI LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 30, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The enclosed letter came to hand by yesterday's post. You will\r\nbe sensible of the circumstances which make it improper that I should\r\nhazard a formal answer, as well as of the desire its friendly aspect\r\nnaturally excites, that those concerned in it should understand that\r\nthe spirit they express is friendly viewed. You can judge also from your\r\nknowledge of the ground, whether it may be usefully encouraged. I take the\r\nliberty, therefore, of availing myself of your neighborhood to Boston,\r\nand of your friendship to me, to request you to say to the captain and\r\nothers verbally whatever you think would be proper, as expressive of my\r\nsentiments on the subject. With respect to the day on which they wish\r\nto fix their anniversary, they may be told, that disapproving myself\r\nof transferring the honors and veneration for the great birthday of our\r\nrepublic to any individual, or of dividing them with individuals, I have\r\ndeclined letting my own birthday be known, and have engaged my family not\r\nto communicate it. This has been the uniform answer to every application\r\nof the kind.\r\n\r\nOn further consideration as to the amendment to our Constitution\r\nrespecting Louisiana, I have thought it better, instead of enumerating the\r\npowers which Congress may exercise, to give them the same powers they have\r\nas to other portions of the Union generally, and to enumerate the special\r\nexceptions, in some such form as the following:\r\n\r\n\"Louisiana, as ceded by France to the United States, is made a part of\r\nthe United States, its white inhabitants shall be citizens, and stand, as\r\nto their rights and obligations, on the same footing with other citizens\r\nof the United States in analogous situations. Save only that as to the\r\nportion thereof lying north of an east and west line drawn through the\r\nmouth of Arkansas river, no new State shall be established, nor any grants\r\nof land made, other than to Indians, in exchange for equivalent portions\r\nof land occupied by them, until an amendment of the Constitution shall be\r\nmade for these purposes.\r\n\r\n\"Florida also, whensoever it may be rightfully obtained, shall become\r\na part of the United States, its white inhabitants shall thereupon be\r\ncitizens, and shall stand, as to their rights and obligations, on the\r\nsame footing with other citizens of the United States, in analogous\r\nsituations.\"\r\n\r\nI quote this for your consideration, observing that the less that is\r\nsaid about any constitutional difficulty, the better; and that it will\r\nbe desirable for Congress to do what is necessary, _in silence_. I find\r\nbut one opinion as to the necessity of shutting up the country for some\r\ntime. We meet in Washington the 25th of September to prepare for Congress.\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations, and great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILSON C. NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 7, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 3d was delivered me at court; but we were\r\nmuch disappointed at not seeing you here, Mr. Madison and the Governor\r\nbeing here at the time. I enclose you a letter from Monroe on the subject\r\nof the late treaty. You will observe a hint in it, to do without delay\r\nwhat we are bound to do. There is reason, in the opinion of our ministers,\r\nto believe, that if the thing were to do over again, it could not be\r\nobtained, and that if we give the least opening, they will declare the\r\ntreaty void. A warning amounting to that has been given to them, and\r\nan unusual kind of letter written by their minister to our Secretary of\r\nState, direct. Whatever Congress shall think it necessary to do, should\r\nbe done with as little debate as possible, and particularly so far as\r\nrespects the constitutional difficulty. I am aware of the force of the\r\nobservations you make on the power given by the Constitution to Congress,\r\nto admit new States into the Union, without restraining the subject to\r\nthe territory then constituting the United States. But when I consider\r\nthat the limits of the United States are precisely fixed by the treaty of\r\n1783, that the Constitution expressly declares itself to be made for the\r\nUnited States, I cannot help believing the intention was not to permit\r\nCongress to admit into the Union new States, which should be formed\r\nout of the territory for which, and under whose authority alone, they\r\nwere then acting. I do not believe it was meant that they might receive\r\nEngland, Ireland, Holland, &c. into it, which would be the case on your\r\nconstruction. When an instrument admits two constructions, the one safe,\r\nthe other dangerous, the one precise, the other indefinite, I prefer\r\nthat which is safe and precise. I had rather ask an enlargement of power\r\nfrom the nation, where it is found necessary, than to assume it by a\r\nconstruction which would make our powers boundless. Our peculiar security\r\nis in the possession of a written Constitution. Let us not make it a\r\nblank paper by construction. I say the same as to the opinion of those\r\nwho consider the grant of the treaty making power as boundless. If it is,\r\nthen we have no Constitution. If it has bounds, they can be no others than\r\nthe definitions of the powers which that instrument gives. It specifies\r\nand delineates the operations permitted to the federal government, and\r\ngives all the powers necessary to carry these into execution. Whatever of\r\nthese enumerated objects is proper for a law, Congress may make the law;\r\nwhatever is proper to be executed by way of a treaty, the President and\r\nSenate may enter into the treaty; whatever is to be done by a judicial\r\nsentence, the judges may pass the sentence. Nothing is more likely than\r\nthat their enumeration of powers is defective. This is the ordinary case\r\nof all human works. Let us go on then perfecting it, by adding, by way of\r\namendment to the Constitution, those powers which time and trial show are\r\nstill wanting. But it has been taken too much for granted, that by this\r\nrigorous construction the treaty power would be reduced to nothing. I had\r\noccasion once to examine its effect on the French treaty, made by the old\r\nCongress, and found that out of thirty odd articles which that contained,\r\nthere were one, two, or three only which could not now be stipulated under\r\nour present Constitution. I confess, then, I think it important, in the\r\npresent case, to set an example against broad construction, by appealing\r\nfor new power to the people. If, however, our friends shall think\r\ndifferently, certainly I shall acquiesce with satisfaction; confiding,\r\nthat the good sense of our country will correct the evil of construction\r\nwhen it shall produce ill effects.\r\n\r\nNo apologies for writing or speaking to me freely are necessary. On the\r\ncontrary, nothing my friends can do is so dear to me, and proves to me\r\ntheir friendship so clearly, as the information they give me of their\r\nsentiments and those of others on interesting points where I am to act,\r\nand where information and warning is so essential to excite in me that due\r\nreflection which ought to precede action. I leave this about the 21st, and\r\nshall hope the District Court will give me an opportunity of seeing you.\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of cordial esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR BENJAMIN RUSH.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, October 4, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--No one would more willingly than myself pay the just tribute\r\ndue to the services of Captain Barry, by writing a letter of condolence\r\nto his widow, as you suggest. But when one undertakes to administer\r\njustice, it must be with an even hand, and by rule; what is done for one,\r\nmust be done for every one in equal degree. To what a train of attentions\r\nwould this draw a President? How difficult would it be to draw the line\r\nbetween that degree of merit entitled to such a testimonial of it, and\r\nthat not so entitled? If drawn in a particular case differently from\r\nwhat the friends of the deceased would judge right, what offence would\r\nit give, and of the most tender kind? How much offence would be given by\r\naccidental inattentions, or want of information? The first step into such\r\nan undertaking ought to be well weighed. On the death of Dr. Franklin,\r\nthe King and Convention of France went into mourning. So did the House of\r\nRepresentatives of the United States: the Senate refused. I proposed to\r\nGeneral Washington that the executive department should wear mourning; he\r\ndeclined it, because he said he should not know where to draw the line,\r\nif he once began that ceremony. Mr. Adams was then Vice President, and I\r\nthought General Washington had his eye on him, whom he certainly did not\r\nlove. I told him the world had drawn so broad a line between himself and\r\nDr. Franklin, on the one side, and the residue of mankind, on the other,\r\nthat we might wear mourning for them, and the question still remain new\r\nand undecided as to all others. He thought it best, however, to avoid\r\nit. On these considerations alone, however well affected to the merit of\r\nCommodore Barry, I think it prudent not to engage myself in a practice\r\nwhich may become embarrassing.\r\n\r\nTremendous times in Europe! How mighty this battle of lions and tigers!\r\nWith what sensations should the common herd of cattle look on it? With\r\nno partialities, certainly. If they can so far worry one another as to\r\ndestroy their power of tyrannizing, the one over the earth, the other the\r\nwaters, the world may perhaps enjoy peace, till they recruit again.\r\n\r\nAffectionate and respectful salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. DUPONT DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, November 1, 1803.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--Your favors of April the 6th, and June the 27th, were duly\r\nreceived, and with the welcome which everything brings from you. The\r\ntreaty which has so happily sealed the friendship of our two countries,\r\nhas been received here with general acclamation. Some inflexible\r\nfederalists have still ventured to brave the public opinion. It will fix\r\ntheir character with the world and with posterity, who, not descending\r\nto the other points of difference between us, will judge them by this\r\nfact, so palpable as to speak for itself in all times and places. For\r\nmyself and my country, I thank you for the aids you have given in it; and\r\nI congratulate you on having lived to give those aids in a transaction\r\nreplete with blessings to unborn millions of men, and which will mark the\r\nface of a portion on the globe so extensive as that which now composes the\r\nUnited States of America. It is true that at this moment a little cloud\r\nhovers in the horizon. The government of Spain has protested against the\r\nright of France to transfer; and it is possible she may refuse possession,\r\nand that this may bring on acts of force. But against such neighbors as\r\nFrance there, and the United States here, what she can expect from so\r\ngross a compound of folly and false faith, is not to be sought in the\r\nbook of wisdom. She is afraid of her enemies in Mexico; but not more than\r\nwe are. Our policy will be, to form New Orleans, and the country on both\r\nsides of it on the Gulf of Mexico, into a State; and, as to all above\r\nthat, to transplant our Indians into it, constituting them a Marechaussée\r\nto prevent emigrants crossing the river, until we shall have filled up\r\nall the vacant country on this side. This will secure both Spain and us\r\nas to the mines of Mexico, for half a century, and we may safely trust the\r\nprovisions for that time to the men who shall live in it.\r\n\r\nI have communicated with Mr. Gallatin on the subject of using your house\r\nin any matters of consequence we may have to do at Paris. He is impressed\r\nwith the same desire I feel to give this mark of our confidence in you,\r\nand the sense we entertain of your friendship and fidelity. Mr. Behring\r\ninforms him that none of the money which will be due from us to him, as\r\nthe assignee of France, will be wanting at Paris. Be assured that our\r\ndispositions are such as to let no occasion pass unimproved of serving\r\nyou, where occurrences will permit it.\r\n\r\nPresent my respects to Madame Dupont, and accept yourself assurances of my\r\nconstant and warm friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT R. LIVINGSTON.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, November 4, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--A report reaches us this day from Baltimore, (on probable,\r\nbut not certain grounds,) that Mr. Jerome Bonaparte, brother of the\r\nFirst Consul, was yesterday[18] married to Miss Patterson, of that city.\r\nThe effect of this measure on the mind of the First Consul, is not for\r\nme to suppose; but as it might occur to him, _primâ facie_, that the\r\nExecutive of the United States ought to have prevented it, I have thought\r\nit advisable to mention the subject to you, that, if necessary, you may\r\nby explanations set that idea to rights. You know that by our laws, all\r\npersons are free to enter into marriage, if of twenty-one years of age,\r\nno one having a power to restrain it, not even their parents; and that\r\nunder that age, no one can prevent it but the parent or guardian. The\r\nlady is under age, and the parents, placed between her affections, which\r\nwere strongly fixed, and the considerations opposing the measure, yielded\r\nwith pain and anxiety to the former. Mr. Patterson is the President of the\r\nBank of Baltimore, the wealthiest man in Maryland, perhaps in the United\r\nStates, except Mr. Carroll; a man of great virtue and respectability;\r\nthe mother is the sister of the lady of General Samuel Smith; and,\r\nconsequently, the station of the family in society is with the first of\r\nthe United States. These circumstances fix rank in a country where there\r\nare no hereditary titles.\r\n\r\nYour treaty has obtained nearly a general approbation. The federalists\r\nspoke and voted against it, but they are now so reduced in their numbers\r\nas to be nothing. The question on its ratification in the Senate was\r\ndecided by twenty-four against seven, which was ten more than enough.\r\nThe vote in the House of Representatives for making provision for its\r\nexecution was carried by eighty-nine against twenty-three, which was\r\na majority of sixty-six, and the necessary bills are going through the\r\nHouses by greater majorities. Mr. Pichon, according to instructions from\r\nhis government, proposed to have added to the ratification a protestation\r\nagainst any failure in time or other circumstances of execution, on\r\nour part. He was told, that in that case we should annex a counter\r\nprotestation, which would leave the thing exactly where it was. That this\r\ntransaction had been conducted, from the commencement of the negociation\r\nto this stage of it, with a frankness and sincerity honorable to both\r\nnations, and comfortable to the heart of an honest man to review; that\r\nto annex to this last chapter of the transaction such an evidence of\r\nmutual distrust, was to change its aspect dishonorably for us both, and\r\ncontrary to truth as to us; for that we had not the smallest doubt that\r\nFrance would punctually execute its part; and I assured Mr. Pichon that\r\nI had more confidence in the word of the First Consul than in all the\r\nparchment we could sign. He saw that we had ratified the treaty; that both\r\nbranches had passed, by great majorities, one of the bills for execution,\r\nand would soon pass the other two; that no circumstances remained that\r\ncould leave a doubt of our punctual performance; and like an able and an\r\nhonest minister, (which he is in the highest degree,) he undertook to do\r\nwhat he knew his employers would do themselves, were they here spectators\r\nof all the existing circumstances, and exchanged the ratifications purely\r\nand simply: so that this instrument goes to the world as an evidence of\r\nthe candor and confidence of the nations in each other, which will have\r\nthe best effects. This was the more justifiable, as Mr. Pichon knew that\r\nSpain had entered with us a protestation against our ratification of the\r\ntreaty, grounded, first, on the assertion that the First Consul had not\r\nexecuted the conditions of the treaties of cession; and, secondly, that\r\nhe had broken a solemn promise not to alienate the country to any nation.\r\nWe answered, that these were private questions between France and Spain,\r\nwhich they must settle together; that we derived our title from the\r\nFirst Consul, and did not doubt his guarantee of it; and we, four days\r\nago, sent off orders to the Governor of the Mississippi territory and\r\nGeneral Wilkinson to move down with the troops at hand to New Orleans,\r\nto receive the possession from Mr. Laussat. If he is heartily disposed\r\nto carry the order of the Consul into execution, he can probably command\r\na volunteer force at New Orleans, and will have the aid of ours also, if\r\nhe desires it, to take the possession, and deliver it to us. If he is not\r\nso disposed, _we_ shall take the possession, and it will rest with the\r\ngovernment of France, by adopting the act as their own, and obtaining the\r\nconfirmation of Spain, to supply the non-execution of their stipulation to\r\ndeliver, and to entitle themselves to the complete execution of our part\r\nof the agreements. In the meantime, the Legislature is passing the bills,\r\nand we are preparing everything to be done on our part towards execution;\r\nand we shall not avail ourselves of the three months' delay after\r\npossession of the province, allowed by the treaty for the delivery of\r\nthe stock, but shall deliver it the moment that possession is known here,\r\nwhich will be on the eighteenth day after it has taken place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAccept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of my constant esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [18] November 8. It is now said that it did not take place on the\r\n         3d, but will this day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DAVID WILLIAMS.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 14, 1803.\r\n\r\nSIR,--I have duly received the volume on the claims of literature, which\r\nyou did me the favor to send me through Mr. Monroe, and have read with\r\nsatisfaction the many judicious reflections it contains, on the condition\r\nof the respectable class of literary men. The efforts for their relief,\r\nmade by a society of private citizens, are truly laudable; but they are,\r\nas you justly observe, but a palliation of an evil, the cure of which\r\ncalls for all the wisdom and the means of the nation. The greatest evils\r\nof populous society have ever appeared to me to spring from the vicious\r\ndistribution of its members among the occupations called for. I have\r\nno doubt that those nations are essentially right, which leave this to\r\nindividual choice, as a better guide to an advantageous distribution\r\nthan any other which could be devised. But when, by a blind concourse,\r\nparticular occupations are ruinously overcharged, and others left in want\r\nof hands, the national authorities can do much towards restoring the\r\nequilibrium. On the revival of letters, learning became the universal\r\nfavorite. And with reason, because there was not enough of it existing\r\nto manage the affairs of a nation to the best advantage, nor to advance\r\nits individuals to the happiness of which they were susceptible, by\r\nimprovements in their minds, their morals, their health, and in those\r\nconveniences which contribute to the comfort and embellishment of life.\r\nAll the efforts of the society, therefore, were directed to the increase\r\nof learning, and the inducements of respect, ease, and profit were held up\r\nfor its encouragement. Even the charities of the nation forgot that misery\r\nwas their object, and spent themselves in founding schools to transfer\r\nto science the hardy sons of the plough. To these incitements were added\r\nthe powerful fascinations of great cities. These circumstances have long\r\nsince produced an overcharge in the class of competitors for learned\r\noccupation, and great distress among the supernumerary candidates; and\r\nthe more, as their habits of life have disqualified them for re-entering\r\ninto the laborious class. The evil cannot be suddenly, nor perhaps ever\r\nentirely cured: nor should I presume to say by what means it may be cured.\r\nDoubtless there are many engines which the nation might bring to bear on\r\nthis object. Public opinion, and public encouragement are among these.\r\nThe class principally defective is that of agriculture. It is the first\r\nin utility, and ought to be the first in respect. The same artificial\r\nmeans which have been used to produce a competition in learning, may be\r\nequally successful in restoring agriculture to its primary dignity in\r\nthe eyes of men. It is a science of the very first order. It counts among\r\nits handmaids the most respectable sciences, such as Chemistry, Natural\r\nPhilosophy, Mechanics, Mathematics generally, Natural History, Botany.\r\nIn every College and University, a professorship of agriculture, and the\r\nclass of its students, might be honored as the first. Young men closing\r\ntheir academical education with this, as the crown of all other sciences,\r\nfascinated with its solid charms, and at a time when they are to choose\r\nan occupation, instead of crowding the other classes, would return to\r\nthe farms of their fathers, their own, or those of others, and replenish\r\nand invigorate a calling, now languishing under contempt and oppression.\r\nThe charitable schools, instead of storing their pupils with a lore which\r\nthe present state of society does not call for, converted into schools of\r\nagriculture, might restore them to that branch qualified to enrich and\r\nhonor themselves, and to increase the productions of the nation instead\r\nof consuming them. A gradual abolition of the useless offices, so much\r\naccumulated in all governments, might close this drain also from the\r\nlabors of the field, and lessen the burthens imposed on them. By these,\r\nand the better means which will occur to others, the surcharge of the\r\nlearned, might in time be drawn off to recruit the laboring class of\r\ncitizens, the sum of industry be increased, and that of misery diminished.\r\n\r\nAmong the ancients, the redundance of population was sometimes checked\r\nby exposing infants. To the moderns, America has offered a more humane\r\nresource. Many, who cannot find employment in Europe, accordingly come\r\nhere. Those who can labor do well, for the most part. Of the learned class\r\nof emigrants, a small portion find employments analogous to their talents.\r\nBut many fail, and return to complete their course of misery in the scenes\r\nwhere it began. Even here we find too strong a current from the country to\r\nthe towns; and instances beginning to appear of that species of misery,\r\nwhich you are so humanely endeavoring to relieve with you. Although we\r\nhave in the old countries of Europe the lesson of their experience to warn\r\nus, yet I am not satisfied we shall have the firmness and wisdom to profit\r\nby it. The general desire of men to live by their heads rather than their\r\nhands, and the strong allurements of great cities to those who have any\r\nturn for dissipation, threaten to make them here, as in Europe, the sinks\r\nof voluntary misery. I perceive, however, that I have suffered my pen to\r\nrun into a disquisition, when I had taken it up only to thank you for the\r\nvolume you had been so kind as to send me, and to express my approbation\r\nof it. After apologizing, therefore, for having touched on a subject so\r\nmuch more familiar to you, and better understood, I beg leave to assure\r\nyou of my high consideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, November 16, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have not written to you since the 11th and 15th of July,\r\nsince which yours of July 18, 22, 25, September 8, 13, and October 3,\r\nhave been received. The present has been long delayed by an expectation\r\ndaily of getting the enclosed account of Louisiana through the press.\r\nThe materials are received from different persons, of good authority. I\r\nenclose you also copies of the treaties for Louisiana, the act for taking\r\npossession, a letter from Dr. Wistar, and some information obtained\r\nby myself from Truteau's journal in MS., all of which may be useful to\r\nyou. The act for taking possession passed with only some small verbal\r\nvariations from that enclosed, of no consequence. Orders went from hence\r\nsigned by the King of Spain and the first consul of France, so as to\r\narrive at Natchez yesterday evening, and we expect the delivery of the\r\nprovince at New Orleans will take place about the close of the ensuing\r\nweek, say about the 26th instant. Governor Claiborne is appointed to\r\nexecute the powers of Commandant and Intendant, until a regular government\r\nshall be organized here. At the moment of delivering over the ports in the\r\nvicinity of New Orleans, orders will be despatched from thence to those in\r\nupper Louisiana to evacuate and deliver them immediately. You can judge\r\nbetter than I can when they may be expected to arrive at these ports,\r\nconsidering how much you have been detained by the low waters, how late it\r\nwill be before you can leave Cahokia, how little progress up the Missouri\r\nyou can make before the freezing of the river; that your winter might\r\nbe passed in gaining much information, by making Cahokia or Caskaskia\r\nyour head quarters, and going to St. Louis and the other Spanish forts,\r\nthat your stores, &c. would thereby be spared for the winter, as your\r\nmen would draw their military rations. All danger of Spanish opposition\r\navoided, we are strongly of opinion here that you had better not enter\r\nthe Missouri till the spring. But as you have a view of all circumstances\r\non the spot, we do not pretend to enjoin it, but leave it to your own\r\njudgment in which we have entire confidence. One thing, however, we are\r\ndecided in; that you must not undertake the winter excursion which you\r\npropose in yours of October 3d. Such an excursion will be more dangerous\r\nthan the main expedition up the Missouri, and would by an accident to\r\nyou, hazard our main object, which, since the acquisition of Louisiana,\r\ninterests everybody in the highest degree. The object of your mission\r\nis single, the direct water communication from sea to sea formed by the\r\nbed of the Missouri, and perhaps the Oregon; by having Mr. Clarke with\r\nyou we consider the expedition as double manned, and therefore the less\r\nliable to failure; for which reason neither of you should be exposed to\r\nrisks by going off of your line. I have proposed in conversation, and it\r\nseems generally assented to, that Congress shall appropriate ten or twelve\r\nthousand dollars for exploring the principal waters of the Mississippi\r\nand Missouri. In that case, I should send a party up the Red river to its\r\nhead, then to cross over to the head of the Arkansas, and come down that.\r\nA second party for the Pani and Padouca rivers, and a third, perhaps, for\r\nthe Morsigona and St. Peter's. As the boundaries of interior Louisiana are\r\nthe high lands enclosing all the waters which run into the Mississippi\r\nor Missouri directly or indirectly, with a quarter breadth on the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, it becomes interesting to fix with precision by celestial\r\nobservations the longitude and latitude of the sources of these rivers, so\r\nproviding points in the contour of our new limits. This will be attempted\r\ndistinctly from your mission, which we consider as of major importance,\r\nand therefore, not to be delayed or hazarded by any episodes whatever.\r\n\r\nThe votes of both Houses on ratifying and carrying the treaties into\r\nexecution, have been precisely party votes, except that General Dayton has\r\nseparated from his friends on these questions, and voted for the treaties.\r\nI will direct the Aurora National Intelligencer to be forwarded to you\r\nfor six months at Cadokie or Kaskaskia, on the presumption you will be\r\nthere. Your friends and acquaintances here, and in Albemarle, are all\r\nwell, so far as I have heard; and I recollect no other small news worth\r\ncommunicating. Present my friendly salutations to Mr. Clarke, and accept\r\nthem affectionately yourself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, December 1, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The explanations in your letter of yesterday were quite\r\nunnecessary to me. I have had too satisfactory proofs of your friendly\r\nregard, to be disposed to suspect anything of a contrary aspect. I\r\nunderstood perfectly the expressions stated in the newspaper to which you\r\nallude, to mean, that \"though the proposition came from the _republican\r\nquarter_ of the House, yet you should not concur with it.\" I am aware that\r\nin parts of the Union, and even with persons to whom Mr. Eppes and Mr.\r\nRandolph are unknown, and myself little known, it will be presumed from\r\ntheir connection, that what comes from them comes from me. No men on earth\r\nare more independent in their sentiments than they are, nor any one less\r\ndisposed than I am to influence the opinions of others. We rarely speak\r\nof politics, or of the proceedings of the House, but merely historically,\r\nand I carefully avoid expressing an opinion on them, in their presence,\r\nthat we may all be at our ease. With other members, I have believed that\r\nmore unreserved communications would be advantageous to the public. This\r\nhas been, perhaps, prevented by mutual delicacy. I have been afraid to\r\nexpress opinions unasked, lest I should be suspected of wishing to direct\r\nthe legislative action of members. They have avoided asking communications\r\nfrom me, probably, lest they should be suspected of wishing to fish out\r\nexecutive secrets. I see too many proofs of the imperfection of human\r\nreason, to entertain wonder or intolerance at any difference of opinion on\r\nany subject; and acquiesce in that difference as easily as on a difference\r\nof feature or form; experience having long taught me the reasonableness\r\nof mutual sacrifices of opinion among those who are to act together for\r\nany common object, and the expediency of doing what good we can, when we\r\ncannot do all we would wish.\r\n\r\nAccept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 13, 1803.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General having considered and decided that the prescription\r\nin the law for establishing a bank, that the officers in the subordinate\r\noffices of discount and deposit, shall be appointed \"on the same terms\r\nand in the same manner practised in the principal bank,\" does not extend\r\nto them the principle of rotation, established by the Legislature in the\r\nbody of directors in the principal bank, it follows that the extension\r\nof that principle has been merely a voluntary and prudential act of the\r\nprincipal bank, from which they are free to depart. I think the extension\r\nwas wise and proper on their part, because the Legislature having deemed\r\nrotation useful in the principal bank constituted by them, there would be\r\nthe same reason for it in the subordinate banks to be established by the\r\nprincipal. It breaks in upon the _esprit du corps_ so apt to prevail in\r\npermanent bodies; it gives a chance for the public eye penetrating into\r\nthe sanctuary of those proceedings and practices, which the avarice of\r\nthe directors may introduce for their personal emolument, and which the\r\nresentments of excluded directors, or the honesty of those duly admitted,\r\nmight betray to the public; and it gives an opportunity at the end of the\r\nyear, or at other periods, of correcting a choice, which, on trial, proves\r\nto have been unfortunate; an evil of which themselves complain in their\r\ndistant institutions. Whether, however, they have a power to alter this,\r\nor not, the executive has no right to decide; and their consultation with\r\nyou has been merely an act of complaisance, or from a desire to shield so\r\nimportant an innovation under the cover of executive sanction. But ought\r\nwe to volunteer our sanction in such a case? Ought we to disarm ourselves\r\nof any fair right of animadversion, whenever that institution shall be a\r\nlegitimate subject of consideration? I own, I think the most proper answer\r\nwould be, that we do not think ourselves authorized to give an opinion on\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nFrom a passage in the letter of the President, I observe an idea of\r\nestablishing a branch bank of the United States in New Orleans. This\r\ninstitution is one of the most deadly hostility existing, against the\r\nprinciples and form of our Constitution. The nation is, at this time,\r\nso strong and united in its sentiments, that it cannot be shaken at this\r\nmoment. But suppose a series of untoward events should occur, sufficient\r\nto bring into doubt the competency of a republican government to meet\r\na crisis of great danger, or to unhinge the confidence of the people in\r\nthe public functionaries; an institution like this, penetrating by its\r\nbranches every part of the Union, acting by command and in phalanx, may,\r\nin a critical moment, upset the government. I deem no government safe\r\nwhich is under the vassalage of any self-constituted authorities, or any\r\nother authority than that of the nation, or its regular functionaries.\r\nWhat an obstruction could not this bank of the United States, with all\r\nits branch banks, be in time of war? It might dictate to us the peace we\r\nshould accept, or withdraw its aids. Ought we then to give further growth\r\nto an institution so powerful, so hostile? That it is so hostile we know,\r\n1, from a knowledge of the principles of the persons composing the body\r\nof directors in every bank, principal or branch; and those of most of the\r\nstockholders: 2, from their opposition to the measures and principles of\r\nthe government, and to the election of those friendly to them: and 3, from\r\nthe sentiments of the newspapers they support. Now, while we are strong,\r\nit is the greatest duty we owe to the safety of our Constitution, to bring\r\nthis powerful enemy to a perfect subordination under its authorities.\r\nThe first measure would be to reduce them to an equal footing only with\r\nother banks, as to the favors of the government. But, in order to be\r\nable to meet a general combination of the banks against us, in a critical\r\nemergency, could we not make a beginning towards an independent use of our\r\nown money, towards holding our own bank in all the deposits where it is\r\nreceived, and letting the treasurer give his draft or note, for payment at\r\nany particular place, which, in a well-conducted government, ought to have\r\nas much credit as any private draft, or bank note, or bill, and would give\r\nus the same facilities which we derive from the banks? I pray you to turn\r\nthis subject in your mind, and to give it the benefit of your knowledge\r\nof details; whereas, I have only very general views of the subject.\r\nAffectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CLINTON.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, December 31, 1803.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I received last night your favor of the 22d, written on the\r\noccasion of the libellous pamphlet lately published with you. I began to\r\nread it, but the dulness of the first page made me give up the reading\r\nfor a dip into here and there a passage, till I came to what respected\r\nmyself. The falsehood of that gave me a test for the rest of the work,\r\nand considering it always useless to read lies, I threw it by. As to\r\nyourself, be assured no contradiction was necessary. The uniform tenor\r\nof a man's life furnishes better evidence of what he has said or done on\r\nany particular occasion than the word of an enemy, and of an enemy too\r\nwho shows that he prefers the use of falsehoods which suit him to truths\r\nwhich do not. Little squibs in certain papers had long ago apprized me of\r\na design to sow tares between particular republican characters, but to\r\ndivide those by lying tales whom truths cannot divide, is the hackneyed\r\npolicy of the gossips of every society. Our business is to march straight\r\nforward to the object which has occupied us for eight and twenty years,\r\nwithout either turning to the right or left. My opinion is that two or\r\nthree years more will bring back to the fold of republicanism all our\r\nwandering brethren whom the cry of \"wolf\" scattered in 1798. Till that\r\nis done, let every man stand to his post, and hazard nothing by change.\r\nAnd when that is done, you and I may retire to the tranquillity which our\r\nyears begin to call for, and revise with satisfaction the efforts of the\r\nage we happened to be born in, crowned with complete success. In the hour\r\nof death we shall have the consolation to see established in the land of\r\nour fathers the most wonderful work of wisdom and disinterested patriotism\r\nthat has ever yet appeared on the globe.\r\n\r\nIn confidence that you will not be weary in well doing, I tender my wishes\r\nthat your future days may be as happy as your past ones have been useful,\r\nand pray you to accept my friendly salutations and assurances of high\r\nconsideration and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CAPTAIN MERIWETHER LEWIS.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 22, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--My letters since your departure have been of July 11th and\r\n15th, November 16th, and January 13th. Yours received are of July 8th,\r\n15th, 22d, and 25th, September 25th and 30th, and October 3d. Since the\r\ndate of the last we have no certain information of your movements. With\r\nmine of November 16th, I sent you some extracts made by myself from the\r\njournal of an agent of the trading company of St. Louis up the Missouri. I\r\nnow enclose a translation of that journal in full for your information. In\r\nthat of the 13th instant I enclosed you a map of a Mr. Evans, a Welshman,\r\nemployed by the Spanish government for that purpose, but whose original\r\nobject I believe had been to go in search of the Welsh Indians, said\r\nto be up the Missouri. On this subject a Mr. Rees, of the same nation,\r\nestablished in the western part of Pennsylvania, will write to you. New\r\nOrleans was delivered to us on the 20th of December, and our garrisons\r\nand government established there. The orders for the delivery of the\r\nupper ports were to leave New Orleans on the 28th, and we presume all\r\nthose ports will be occupied by our troops by the last day of the present\r\nmonth. When your instructions were penned, this new position was not so\r\nauthentically known as to affect the complexion of your instructions.\r\nBeing now become sovereigns of the country, without, however, any\r\ndiminution of the Indian rights of occupancy, we are authorized to\r\npropose to them in direct terms the institution of commerce with them.\r\nIt will now be proper you should inform those through whose country you\r\nwill pass, or whom you may meet, that their late fathers, the Spaniards,\r\nhave agreed to withdraw all their troops from all the waters and country\r\nof the Mississippi and Missouri. That they have surrendered to us all\r\ntheir subjects, Spanish and French, settled there and all their posts and\r\nlands; that henceforward we become their fathers and friends, and that\r\nwe shall endeavor that they shall have no cause to lament the change;\r\nthat we have sent you to inquire into the nature of the country and the\r\nnations inhabiting it, to know at what places and times we must establish\r\nstores of goods among them, to exchange for their peltries; that as soon\r\nas you return with the necessary information, we shall prepare supplies\r\nof goods and persons to carry them, and make the proper establishments;\r\nthat in the meantime the same traders who reside among us visit them, and\r\nwho now are a part of us, will continue to supply them as usual; that\r\nwe shall endeavor to become acquainted with them as soon as possible;\r\nand that they will find in us faithful friends and protectors. Although\r\nyou will pass through no settlements of the Sioux (except seceders) yet\r\nyou will probably meet with parties of them. On that nation we wish most\r\nparticularly to make a friendly impression, because of their immense\r\npower, and because we learn that they are very desirous of being on the\r\nmost friendly terms with us.\r\n\r\nI enclose you a letter, which I believe is from some one on the part of\r\nthe Philosophical Society. They have made you a member, and your diploma\r\nis lodged with me; but I suppose it safest to keep it here and not to send\r\nit after you. Mr. Harvie departs to-morrow for France, as the bearer of\r\nthe Louisiana stock to Paris. Captain William Brent takes his place with\r\nme. Congress will probably continue in session through the month of March.\r\nYour friends here and in Albemarle, as far as I recollect, are well.\r\nTrist will be the collector of New Orleans, and his family will go to him\r\nin the spring. Dr. Bache is now in Philadelphia, and probably will not\r\nreturn to New Orleans. Accept my friendly salutations, and assurances of\r\naffectionate esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TIMOTHY BLOODWORTH, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 29, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I thank you for the seed of the fly-trap. It is the first\r\nI have ever been able to obtain, and shall take great care of it. I am\r\nwell pleased to hear of the progress of republicanism with you. To do\r\nwithout a land tax, excise, stamp tax and the other internal taxes, to\r\nsupply their place by economies, so as still to support the government\r\nproperly, and to apply $7,300,000 a year steadily to the payment of the\r\npublic debt; to discontinue a great portion of the expenses on armies and\r\nnavies, yet protect our country and its commerce with what remains; to\r\npurchase a country as large and more fertile than the one we possessed\r\nbefore, yet ask neither a new tax, nor another soldier to be added, but\r\nto provide that that country shall by its own income, pay for itself\r\nbefore the purchase money is due; to preserve peace with all nations, and\r\nparticularly an equal friendship to the two great rival powers France and\r\nEngland, and to maintain the credit and character of the nation in as high\r\na degree as it has ever enjoyed, are measures which I think must reconcile\r\nthe great body of those who thought themselves our enemies; but were in\r\ntruth only the enemies of certain Jacobinical, atheistical, anarchical,\r\nimaginary caricatures, which existed only in the land of the raw head\r\nand bloody bones, beings created to frighten the credulous. By this time\r\nthey see enough of us to judge our characters by what we do, and not by\r\nwhat we never did, nor thought of doing, but in the lying chronicles of\r\nthe newspapers. I know indeed there are some characters who have been\r\ntoo prominent to retract, too proud and impassioned to relent, too greedy\r\nafter office and profit to relinquish their longings, and who have covered\r\ntheir devotion to monarchism under the mantle of federalism, who never\r\ncan be cured of their enmities. These are incurable maniacs, for whom the\r\nhospitable doors of Bedlam are ready to open, but they are permitted to\r\nwalk abroad while they refrain from personal assault.\r\n\r\nThe applications for Louisiana are so numerous that it would be immoral to\r\ngive a hope to the friends you mention. The rage for going to that country\r\nseems universal. Accept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of\r\ngreat esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR PRIESTLEY.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 29, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of December the 12th came duly to hand, as did the\r\nsecond letter to Doctor Linn, and the treatise on Phlogiston, for which\r\nI pray you to accept my thanks. The copy for Mr. Livingston has been\r\ndelivered, together with your letter to him, to Mr. Harvie, my secretary,\r\nwho departs in a day or two for Paris, and will deliver them himself\r\nto Mr. Livingston, whose attention to your matter cannot be doubted. I\r\nhave also to add my thanks to Mr. Priestley, your son, for the copy of\r\nyour Harmony, which I have gone through with great satisfaction. It is\r\nthe first I have been able to meet with, which is clear of those long\r\nrepetitions of the same transaction, as if it were a different one because\r\nrelated with some different circumstances.\r\n\r\nI rejoice that you have undertaken the task of comparing the moral\r\ndoctrines of Jesus with those of the ancient Philosophers. You are so\r\nmuch in possession of the whole subject, that you will do it easier and\r\nbetter than any other person living. I think you cannot avoid giving, as\r\npreliminary to the comparison, a digest of his moral doctrines, extracted\r\nin his own words from the Evangelists, and leaving out everything relative\r\nto his personal history and character. It would be short and precious.\r\nWith a view to do this for my own satisfaction, I had sent to Philadelphia\r\nto get two testaments (Greek) of the same edition, and two English, with a\r\ndesign to cut out the morsels of morality, and paste them on the leaves of\r\na book, in the manner you describe as having been pursued in forming your\r\nHarmony. But I shall now get the thing done by better hands.\r\n\r\nI very early saw that Louisiana was indeed a speck in our horizon which\r\nwas to burst in a tornado; and the public are unapprised how near this\r\ncatastrophe was. Nothing but a frank and friendly development of causes\r\nand effects on our part, and good sense enough in Bonaparte to see that\r\nthe train was unavoidable, and would change the face of the world, saved\r\nus from that storm. I did not expect he would yield till a war took place\r\nbetween France and England, and my hope was to palliate and endure, if\r\nMessrs. Ross, Morris, &c. did not force a premature rupture, until that\r\nevent. I believed the event not very distant, but acknowledge it came on\r\nsooner than I had expected. Whether, however, the good sense of Bonaparte\r\nmight not see the course predicted to be necessary and unavoidable, even\r\nbefore a war should be imminent, was a chance which we thought it our\r\nduty to try; but the immediate prospect of rupture brought the case to\r\nimmediate decision. The _denouement_ has been happy; and I confess I look\r\nto this duplication of area for the extending a government so free and\r\neconomical as ours, as a great achievement to the mass of happiness which\r\nis to ensue. Whether we remain in one confederacy, or form into Atlantic\r\nand Mississippi confederacies, I believe not very important to the\r\nhappiness of either part. Those of the western confederacy will be as much\r\nour children and descendants as those of the eastern, and I feel myself\r\nas much identified with that country, in future time, as with this; and\r\ndid I now foresee a separation at some future day, yet I should feel the\r\nduty and the desire to promote the western interests as zealously as the\r\neastern, doing all the good for both portions of our future family which\r\nshould fall within my power.\r\n\r\nHave you seen the new work of Malthus on population? It is one of the\r\nablest I have ever seen. Although his main object is to delineate the\r\neffects of redundancy of population, and to test the poor laws of England,\r\nand other palliations for that evil, several important questions in\r\npolitical economy, allied to his subject incidentally, are treated with\r\na masterly hand. It is a single octavo volume, and I have been only able\r\nto read a borrowed copy, the only one I have yet heard of. Probably our\r\nfriends in England will think of you, and give you an opportunity of\r\nreading it. Accept my affectionate salutations, and assurances of great\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. SAY.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, February 1, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have to acknowledge the receipt of your obliging letter, and\r\nwith it, of two very interesting volumes on Political Economy. These found\r\nme engaged in giving the leisure moments I rarely find, to the perusal of\r\nMalthus' work on population, a work of sound logic, in which some of the\r\nopinions of Adam Smith, as well as of the economists, are ably examined.\r\nI was pleased, on turning to some chapters where you treat the same\r\nquestions, to find his opinions corroborated by yours. I shall proceed to\r\nthe reading of your work with great pleasure. In the meantime, the present\r\nconveyance, by a gentlemen of my family going to Paris, is too safe to\r\nhazard a delay in making my acknowledgments for this mark of attention,\r\nand for having afforded to me a satisfaction, which the ordinary course of\r\nliterary communications could not have given me for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nThe differences of circumstance between this and the old countries of\r\nEurope, furnish differences of fact whereon to reason, in questions of\r\npolitical economy, and will consequently produce sometimes a difference\r\nof result. There, for instance, the quantity of food is fixed, or\r\nincreasing in a slow and only arithmetical ratio, and the proportion is\r\nlimited by the same ratio. Supernumerary births consequently add only\r\nto your mortality. Here the immense extent of uncultivated and fertile\r\nlands enables every one who will labor to marry young, and to raise a\r\nfamily of any size. Our food, then, may increase geometrically with our\r\nlaborers, and our births, however multiplied, become effective. Again,\r\nthere the best distribution of labor is supposed to be that which places\r\nthe manufacturing hands alongside the agricultural; so that the one\r\npart shall feed both, and the other part furnish both with clothes and\r\nother comforts. Would that be best here? Egoism and first appearances\r\nsay yes. Or would it be better that all our laborers should be employed\r\nin agriculture? In this case a double or treble portion of fertile lands\r\nwould be brought into culture; a double or treble creation of food be\r\nproduced, and its surplus go to nourish the now perishing births of\r\nEurope, who in return would manufacture and send us in exchange our\r\nclothes and other comforts. Morality listens to this, and so invariably\r\ndo the laws of nature create our duties and interests, that when they seem\r\nto be at variance, we ought to suspect some fallacy in our reasonings. In\r\nsolving this question, too, we should allow its just weight to the moral\r\nand physical preference of the agricultural, over the manufacturing, man.\r\nMy occupations permit me only to ask questions. They deny me the time, if\r\nI had the information, to answer them. Perhaps, as worthy the attention\r\nof the author of the Traité d'Economie Politique, I shall find them\r\nanswered in that work. If they are not, the reason will have been that\r\nyou wrote for Europe; while I shall have asked them because I think for\r\nAmerica. Accept, Sir, my respectful salutations, and assurances of great\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO RUFUS KING, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 17, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I now return you the manuscript history of Bacon's rebellion,\r\nwith many thanks for the communication. It is really a valuable morsel\r\nin the history of Virginia. That transaction is the more marked, as it\r\nwas the only rebellion or insurrection which had ever taken place in the\r\ncolony before the American Revolution. Neither its cause nor course have\r\nbeen well understood, the public records containing little on the subject.\r\nIt is very long since I read the several histories of Virginia, but the\r\nimpression remaining on my mind was not at all that which the writer\r\ngives; and it is impossible to refuse assent to the candor and simplicity\r\nof history. I have taken the liberty of copying it, which has been the\r\nreason of the detention of it. I had an opportunity, too, of communicating\r\nit to a person who was just putting into the press a history of Virginia,\r\nbut all in a situation to be corrected. I think it possible that among the\r\nancient manuscripts I possess at Monticello, I may be able to trace the\r\nauthor. I shall endeavor to do it the first visit I make to that place,\r\nand if with success, I will do myself the pleasure of communicating it\r\nto you. From the public records there is no hope, as they were destroyed\r\nby the British, I believe, very completely, during their invasion of\r\nVirginia. Accept my salutations, and assurances of high consideration and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                                         February 19, 1804.\r\n\r\nDoctor Stevens having been sent by the preceding administration, in\r\n1798, to St. Domingo, with the commission of consul-general, and also\r\nwith authorities as an agent additional to the consular powers, under a\r\nstipulation that his expenses should be borne; an account of these is now\r\nexhibited to the Secretary of State, and the questions arise whether the\r\npayment can be authorized by the Executive, and out of what fund?\r\n\r\nThe Constitution has made the Executive the organ for managing our\r\nintercourse with foreign nations. It authorizes him to appoint and receive\r\nambassadors, other public ministers, and consuls. The term minister\r\nbeing applicable to other agents as well as diplomatic, the constant\r\npractice of the government, considered as a commentary, established this\r\nbroad meaning; and the public interest approves it; because it would be\r\nextravagant to employ a diplomatic minister for a business which a mere\r\nrider would execute. The Executive being thus charged with the foreign\r\nintercourse, no law has undertaken to prescribe its specific duties.\r\nThe permanent act of 1801, however, first, where he uses the agency of\r\na minister plenipotentiary, or chargé, restricts him in the sums to be\r\nallowed for outfit, salary, return, and a secretary; and second, when\r\nany law has appropriated a sum for the _contingent_ expenses of foreign\r\nintercourse, leaves to his discretion to dispense with the exhibition of\r\nthe vouchers of its expenditure in the public offices. Under these two\r\nstanding provisions there is annually a sum appropriated for the expenses\r\nof intercourse with foreign nations. The _purposes_ of the appropriation\r\nbeing expressed by the _law_, in terms as general as the _duties_ are by\r\nthe _Constitution_, the application of the money is left as much to the\r\ndiscretion of the Executive, as the performance of the duties, saving\r\nalways the provisions of 1801.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this appropriation is usually made on an estimate, given\r\nby the Secretary of State to the Secretary of the Treasury, and by him\r\nreported to Congress. But Congress, aware that too minute a specification\r\nhas its evil as well as a too general one, does not make the estimate\r\na part of their law, but gives a sum in gross, trusting the Executive\r\ndiscretion for that year and that sum only; so in other departments, as\r\nof war for instance, the estimate of the Secretary specifies all the items\r\nof clothing, subsistence, pay, &c., of the army. And Congress throws this\r\ninto such masses as they think best, to wit, a sum in gross for clothing,\r\nanother for subsistence, a third for pay, &c., binding up the Executive\r\ndiscretion only by the sum, and the object generalized to a certain\r\ndegree. The minute details of the estimate are thus dispensed with in\r\npoint of obligation, and the discretion of the officer is enlarged to the\r\nlimits of the classification, which Congress thinks it best for the public\r\ninterest to make. In the case before us, then, the sum appropriated may\r\nbe applied to any agency with a foreign nation, which the Constitution\r\nhas made a part of the duty of the President, as the organ of foreign\r\nintercourse.\r\n\r\nThe sum appropriated is generally the exact amount of the estimate, but\r\nnot always. In the present instance the estimate, being for 1803, was only\r\nof $62,550, (including two outfits,) and the appropriation was of $75,562,\r\nleaving a difference of $13,012. If indeed, there be not enough of this\r\nappropriation left to pay Dr. Stevens' just demands, they cannot be paid\r\nuntil Congress shall make some appropriation applicable to them. I say his\r\n_just_ demands, because by the undertaking of the then administration to\r\npay his expenses, justice as well as law will understand his _reasonable_\r\nexpenses. These must be tried by the scale which law and usage have\r\nestablished, whereon the Minister, Chargé, and Secretary, are given as\r\nfixed terms of comparison. The undefined agency of Dr. Stevens must be\r\nplaced opposite to that term of the scale, with which it may fairly be\r\nthought to correspond; and if he has gone beyond that, his expenses should\r\nbe reduced to it. I think them beyond it, and suppose that Dr. Stevens,\r\nviewing himself as a merchant, as well as a public agent, found it\r\nanswer his purposes as a merchant to apply a part of his receipts in that\r\ncharacter in addition to what he might reasonably expect from the public,\r\nnot then meaning to charge to his public character the extraordinary\r\nstyle of expense which he believed at the time he could afford out of his\r\nmercantile profits.\r\n\r\n  [_Statement of Dr. Stevens' case, referred to in preceding letter._]\r\n\r\nThe Constitution having provided that the President should appoint\r\nambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and all other officers\r\nwhich shall be established by law, the first Congress which met passed\r\na law (July 1, 1790) authorizing him to draw from the treasury $40,000\r\nannually for the support of such persons as he shall commission to serve\r\nthe United States in foreign parts, and for the expense incident to the\r\nbusiness in which they may be employed; with a proviso that, exclusive\r\nof an outfit to a Minister Plenipotentiary or Chargé, not exceeding a\r\nyear's salary, he should allow to any Minister Plenipotentiary not more\r\nthan $9,000 a year, for all his personal services and other expenses;\r\nto a Chargé not more than $4,500; to a Secretary not more than $1,350;\r\nand with a second proviso as to the mode of settlement. This act, which\r\nwas temporary, was continued by those of 1793, February 9, 1794, March\r\n20, 1796, May 30, 1798, March 19, till 1800, May 10, when they turned\r\nthe two provisos into enacting clauses, and made them permanent, and\r\nthe appropriating clause which made the body of the law before, is now\r\nannually inserted in the general appropriating law. See 1800, May 7, 1801,\r\nMarch 3, 1802, May 1, 1803, March 2, and 1804, March --. As Congress, in\r\norder to limit the discretion of officers as far as is safe, is in the\r\npractice of throwing the objects of appropriations into groups, _e. g._ to\r\nthe Secretary of State, and clerks, and other persons in that department\r\nso much; Secretary of Treasury, &c., so much; clothing for the army so\r\nmuch; subsistence so much; pay so much, &c. So they might have analysed\r\nthe foreign appropriation by allowing for outfits of ministers so much;\r\nsalaries of ministers so much; contingent expenses so much, &c. But they\r\nchose to throw it all into one mass, only providing that no outfit should\r\nexceed a year's salary, and no salary of a minister be more than $9,000;\r\nof a Chargé $4,500; Secretary $1,350, &c.; leaving the President free to\r\ngive them less if he chose, and to give to Ambassadors, Envoys, and other\r\nagents, what he thought proper. From the origin of the present government\r\nto this day, the construction of the laws, and the practice under them,\r\nhas been to consider the whole fund (with only the limitations before\r\nmentioned) as under the discretion of the President as to the persons he\r\nshould commission to serve the United States in foreign parts, and all\r\nthe expenses incident to the business in which they may be employed. The\r\ngrade consequently or character in which they should be employed, their\r\nallowance, &c. Thus Governor Morris was appointed by General Washington\r\ninformally and without a commission to confer with the British ministers,\r\nand was allowed for eight months (I think) $1,000. Colonel Humphreys was\r\nappointed in 1790, to go as an agent to Madrid, and was allowed at the\r\nrate of $2,250 per annum. Dumas was kept at the Hague many years as an\r\nagent at $1,300 a year. Mr. Cutting was allowed disbursements for sailors\r\nin London in 1791, $233 33. Presents were made to the Chevalier Luzerne,\r\non taking leave, worth $1,062. Van Berkel $697. Du Moustier $555, in 1791.\r\nMr. Short was sent to Amsterdam as an agent in 1792, and allowed $444 43.\r\nJames Blake was sent as agent to Madrid in 1793, and received an advance\r\nof $800. I know not how much afterwards, as I left the office of Secretary\r\nof State at the close of that year. In 1794, Mr. Jay was appointed Envoy\r\nExtraordinary, a grade not particularly named in the Constitution, or\r\nany law, yet General Washington fixed his allowance. During the present\r\nadministration Mr. Dawson and Lieutenant Leonard have been sent on special\r\nagencies. From the beginning of the government it has been the rule when\r\none of our ministers is ordered to another place on a special business,\r\nto allow his expenses on that special mission, his salary going on at\r\nhis residence where his family remains. Mr. Short's mission from Paris to\r\nAmsterdam, from Paris to Madrid; Mr. Pinckney from London to Madrid; Mr.\r\nMurray's from the Hague to Paris, and others not recollected by me, are\r\ninstances of this. These facts are stated to show that it has been the\r\nuniform opinion and practice that the whole foreign fund was placed by the\r\nLegislature on the footing of a contingent fund, in which they undertake\r\nno specifications, but leave the whole to the discretion of the President.\r\nThe whole is but from forty to sixty or seventy thousand dollars. After\r\nthe establishment of the general fund for foreign intercourse, Congress\r\nfound it necessary to make a separate branch for the Barbary powers. This\r\nwas done covertly in the beginning, to wit, in 1792, they gave $50,000\r\nadditional to the foreign fund, in 1794, $1,000,000 additional without\r\nlimiting it to Barbary. Yet it was secretly understood by the President,\r\nand his discretion was trusted. In 1796, they gave $260,000 for treaties\r\nwith the Mediterranean powers, in 1797, $280,259 03, for the expenses of\r\nnegotiation with Algiers. They did not undertake a more minute analysis\r\nor specification, but left it to the President. The laws of 1796, May 6,\r\n1797, March 3, 1799, March 2, give sums for specific purposes because\r\nthese purposes were simple and understood by the Legislature. But in\r\ngeneral, in this branch of the foreign expenses, as in the former one,\r\nthe Legislature has thought that to cramp the public service by too minute\r\nspecifications in cases which they could not foresee, might do more evil\r\nthan a temporary trust to the President, which could be put an end to if\r\nabused.\r\n\r\nIn our western governments, heretofore established, they were so well\r\nunderstood by Congress, that they could and did specify every item of\r\nexpense, except a very small residuum for which they made contingent\r\nappropriations. But when they came to provide at this session for the\r\nLouisiana government, with which they were not acquainted, they gave\r\ntwenty thousand dollars for compensation to the officers of the government\r\nemployed by the President, and for other civil expenses under the\r\ndirection of the President. And their first step towards the acquisition\r\nof that country was to confide to the President two millions of dollars\r\nunder the general appropriation for foreign intercourse. These facts show\r\nthat so far from having experienced evil from confiding the forty thousand\r\ndollars foreign fund to the discretion of the executive without a specific\r\nanalysis of its application, they have continued it on that footing, and\r\nin many other great cases where analysis was difficult or inexpedient they\r\nhave given the sums in mass, and left the analysis to him, only requiring\r\nan account to be rendered.\r\n\r\nThis statement has been made in order to place on its true ground the case\r\nof Doctor Stevens. He was employed by Mr. Adams as Agent to St. Domingo,\r\nand was to be allowed his expenses, though these were not limited, yet\r\nthe law limits them in such case to what were reasonable. Doubts have\r\narisen at the treasury whether the executive had a right to make such a\r\ncontract, and whether there be any fund out of which it can be paid? Some\r\ndoubt has been expressed whether an appropriation law gives authority\r\nto pay for the purpose of the appropriation without some particular law\r\nauthorizing it. If this be the case, the forty thousand dollar fund has\r\nbeen paid away without authority from its first establishment; for it\r\nnever has been given but by a clause of appropriation. The executive\r\nbelieves this sufficient authority, and so we presume did the Legislature,\r\nor they would have given authority in some other sufficient form. And\r\nwhere is the rule of legal construction to be found which ascribes less\r\neffect to the words of an appropriation law, than of any other law? It\r\nis also doubted whether the estimate on which an appropriation is founded\r\ndoes not restrain the application to the specific articles, their number\r\nand amount as stated in the estimate? Were an appropriation law to come\r\nbefore a judge would he decide its meaning from its text, or would he call\r\non the officer to produce their estimates as being a part of the law?\r\nOn the whole, the following questions are to be determined: 1. Whether\r\nthe laws do not justify the construction which has been uniformly given,\r\neither strictly, or at least so ambiguously, that, as in judiciary cases,\r\nthe decisions which have taken place have fixed their meaning and made it\r\nlaw? 2. Whether they are so palpably against law that the practice must\r\nbe arrested? 3. Whether it shall be arrested retrospectively as to moneys\r\nengaged but not yet actually paid, or only as to future contracts? 4.\r\nWhether any circumstances take Dr. Stevens' case out of the conditions and\r\nrights of other foreign agencies?\r\n\r\nMarch 23, 1804.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LATROBE.\r\n\r\n                                             WASHINGTON, February 28, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I am sorry the explanations attempted between Dr. Thornton\r\nand yourself, on the manner of finishing the chamber of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, have not succeeded. At the original establishment of this\r\nplace advertisements were published many months offering premiums for the\r\nbest plans for a Capitol and a President's house. Many were sent in. A\r\ncouncil was held by General Washington with the board of Commissioners,\r\nand after very mature examination two were preferred, and the premiums\r\ngiven to their authors, Doctor Thornton and Hobens, and the plans were\r\ndecided on. Hobens' has been executed. On Doctor Thornton's plan of the\r\nCapitol the north wing has been extended, and the south raised one story.\r\nIn order to get along with any public undertaking it is necessary that\r\nsome stability of plan be observed--nothing impedes progress so much as\r\nperpetual changes of design. I yield to this principle in the present case\r\nmore willingly because the plan begun for the Representative room will, in\r\nmy opinion, be more handsome and commodious than anything which can now\r\nbe proposed on the same area. And though the spheroidical dome presents\r\ndifficulties to the executor, yet they are not beyond his art; and it is\r\nto overcome difficulties that we employ men of genius. While however I\r\nexpress my opinion that we had better go through with this wing of the\r\nCapitol on the plan which has been settled, I would not be understood to\r\nsuppose there does exist sufficient authority to control the original plan\r\nin any of its parts, and to accommodate it to changes of circumstances.\r\nI only mean that it is not advisable to change that of this wing in its\r\npresent stage. Though I have spoken of a spheroidical roof, that will\r\nnot be correct by the figure. Every rib will be a portion of a circle of\r\nwhich the radius will be determined by the span and rise of each rib.\r\nWould it not be best to make the internal columns of well-burnt brick,\r\nmoulded in portions of circles adapted to the diminution of the columns?\r\n2d. Burlington, in his notes on Palladio, tells us that he found most of\r\nthe buildings erected under Palladio's direction, and described in his\r\narchitecture, to have their columns made of brick in this way and covered\r\nover with stucco. I know an instance of a range of six or eight columns\r\nin Virginia, twenty feet high, well proportioned and properly diminished,\r\nexecuted by a common bricklayer. The bases and capitols would of course\r\nbe of hewn stone. I suggest this for your consideration, and tender you my\r\nfriendly salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELBRIDGE GERRY.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 3, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Although it is long since I received your favor of October the\r\n27th, yet I have not had leisure sooner to acknowledge it. In the middle\r\nand southern States, as great an union of sentiment has now taken place\r\nas is perhaps desirable. For as there will always be an opposition, I\r\nbelieve it had better be from avowed monarchists than republicans. New\r\nYork seems to be in danger of republican division; Vermont is solidly with\r\nus; Rhode Island with us on anomalous grounds; New Hampshire on the verge\r\nof the republican shore; Connecticut advancing towards it very slowly,\r\nbut with steady step; your State only uncertain of making port at all. I\r\nhad forgotten Delaware, which will be always uncertain, from the divided\r\ncharacter of her citizens. If the amendment of the Constitution passes\r\nRhode Island, (and we expect to hear in a day or two,) the election for\r\nthe ensuing four years seems to present nothing formidable. I sincerely\r\nregret that the unbounded calumnies of the federal party have obliged\r\nme to throw myself on the verdict of my country for trial, my great\r\ndesire having been to retire, at the end of the present term, to a\r\nlife of tranquillity; and it was my decided purpose when I entered into\r\noffice. They force my continuance. If we can keep the vessel of State as\r\nsteadily in her course for another four years, my earthly purposes will be\r\naccomplished, and I shall be free to enjoy, as you are doing, my family,\r\nmy farm, and my books. That your enjoyments may continue as long as you\r\nshall wish them, I sincerely pray, and tender you my friendly salutations,\r\nand assurances of great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM DUNBAR, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 13, 1804.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Geometrical Drawing.]\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of January 28 has been duly received, and I have\r\nread with great satisfaction your ingenuous paper on the subject of\r\nthe Mississippi, which I shall immediately forward to the Philosophical\r\nSociety, where it will be duly prized. To prove the value I set on it,\r\nand my wish that it may go to the public without any imperfection about\r\nit, I will take the liberty of submitting to your consideration the only\r\npassage which I think may require it. You say, page 9, \"The velocity of\r\nrivers is greatest at the surface, and gradually diminishes downwards.\"\r\nAnd this principle enters into some subsequent parts of the paper, and\r\nhas too much effect on the phenomena of that river not to merit mature\r\nconsideration. I can but suppose it at variance with the law of motion\r\nin rivers. In strict theory, the velocity of water at any given depth\r\nin a river is (in addition to its velocity at its surface) whatever a\r\nbody would have acquired by falling through a space equal to that depth.\r\nIf, in the middle of a river, we drop a vertical line, _a e_, from its\r\nsurface to its bottom, and (using a perch, or rather a measure of 16.125\r\nfeet, for our unit of measure) we draw, at the depths, _b c d e_, (which\r\nsuppose = 1.4 9.16 perch ordinates in the direction of the stream, equal\r\nto the odd numbers, 3, 5, 7, 9 perch, these ordinates will represent the\r\nadditional velocities of the water per second of time, at the depth of\r\ntheir respective abscissæ, and will terminate in a curve, _a f g h i_,)\r\nwhich will represent the velocity of their current in every point, and\r\nthe whole mass of water passing on in a second of time.[19] This would\r\nbe the theory of the motion of rivers, were there no friction; but the\r\nbottom being rough, its friction with the lower sheet or lamina of water\r\nwill retard that lamina; the friction or viscosity of the particles of\r\nwhich, again, with those of the one next above, will retard that somewhat\r\nless, the 2d retard the 3d, the 3d the 4th, and so on upwards, diminishing\r\ntill the retardation becomes insensible; and the theoretic curve will be\r\nmodified by that cause, as at _n o_, removing the maximum of motion from\r\nthe bottom somewhere upwardly. Again, the same circumstances of friction\r\nand viscosity of the particles of water among themselves, will cause\r\nthe lamina at the surface to be accelerated by the quicker motion of the\r\none next below it, the 2d still more by the 3d, the 3d by the 4th, and\r\nso on downwards, the acceleration always increasing till it reached the\r\nlamina of greatest motion. The exact point of the maximum of motion cannot\r\nbe calculated, because it depends on friction; but it is probably much\r\nnearer the bottom than top, because the greater power of the current there\r\nsooner overcomes the effect of the friction. Ultimately, the curve will be\r\nsensibly varied by being swelled outwardly above, and retracted inwardly\r\nbelow, somewhat like _a k l m n o_, in the preceding diagram.\r\n\r\nIndulging corollaries on this theory, let us suppose a plane surface, as\r\na large sheet of cast-iron, let down by a cable from a boat, and made to\r\npresent its surface to the current by a long vane fixed on its axis in\r\nthe direction of the current. Would not the current below, laying hold\r\nof this plate, draw the boat down the stream with more rapidity than that\r\nwith which it otherwise moves on the surface of the water? Again, at the\r\ncross current of the surface which flows into the Chafaleya, and endangers\r\nthe drawing boats into that river, as you mention, page 18, would not the\r\nsame plane surface, if let down into the under current, which moves in\r\nthe direction of the bed of the main river, have the effect of drawing the\r\nvessel across the lateral current prevailing at its surface, and conduct\r\nthe boat with safety along the channel of the river?\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations are submitted to your consideration. By\r\ndrawing your attention to the subject, they will enable you, on further\r\nreflection, to confirm or correct your first opinion. If the latter,\r\nthere would be time, before we print a volume, to make any alterations or\r\nadditions to your paper which you might wish. We were much indebted for\r\nyour communications on the subject of Louisiana. The substance of what was\r\nreceived from you, as well as others, was digested together and printed,\r\nwithout letting it be seen from whom the particulars came, as some were\r\nof a nature to excite ill-will. Of these publications I sent you a copy.\r\nOn the subject of the limits of Louisiana, nothing was said therein,\r\nbecause we thought it best first to have explanations with Spain. In the\r\nfirst visit, after receiving the treaty, which I paid to Monticello, which\r\nwas in August, I availed myself of what I have there, to investigate the\r\nlimits. While I was in Europe, I had purchased everything I could lay\r\nmy hands on which related to any part of America, and particularly had\r\na pretty full collection of the English, French and Spanish authors, on\r\nthe subject of Louisiana. The information I got from these was entirely\r\nsatisfactory, and I threw it into a shape which would easily take the form\r\nof a memorial. I now enclose you a copy of it. One single fact in it was\r\ntaken from a publication in a newspaper, supposed to be written by Judge\r\nBay, who had lived in West Florida. This asserted that the country from\r\nthe Iberville to the Perdido was to this day called Louisiana, and a part\r\nof the government of Louisiana. I wrote to you to ascertain that fact, and\r\nreceived the information you were so kind as to send me; on the receipt\r\nof which, I changed the form of the assertion, so as to adapt it to what I\r\nsuppose to be the fact, and to reconcile the testimony I have received, to\r\nwit, that though the name and division of West Florida have been retained;\r\nand in strictness, that country is still called by that name; yet it\r\nis also called Louisiana in common parlance, and even in some authentic\r\npublic documents. The fact, however, is not of much importance. It would\r\nonly have been an _argumentum ad hominem_. Although I would wish the paper\r\nenclosed never to be seen by anybody but yourself, and that it should not\r\neven be mentioned that the facts and opinions therein stated are founded\r\nin public authority, yet I have no objections to their being freely\r\nadvanced in conversation, and as private and individual opinion, believing\r\nit will be advantageous that the extent of our rights should be known to\r\nthe inhabitants of the country; and that however we may compromise on our\r\nWestern limits, we never shall on the Eastern.\r\n\r\nI formerly acquainted you with the mission of Captain Lewis up the\r\nMissouri, and across from its head to the Pacific. He takes about a dozen\r\nmen with him, is well provided with instruments, and qualified to give\r\nus the geography of the line he passes along with astronomical accuracy.\r\nHe is now hutted opposite the mouth of the Missouri, ready to enter\r\nit on the opening of the season. He will be at least two years on the\r\nexpedition. I propose to charge the Surveyor-general N. of Ohio, with a\r\nsurvey of the Mississippi from its source to the mouth of the Ohio, and\r\nwith settling some other interesting points of geography in that quarter.\r\nCongress will probably authorize me to explore the greater waters on the\r\nwestern side of the Mississippi and Missouri, to their sources. In this\r\ncase I should propose to send one party up the Panis river to its source,\r\nthence along the highlands to the source of the Radoneas river and down\r\nit to its mouth, giving the whole course of both parties, corrected\r\nby astronomical observation. These several surveys will enable us to\r\nprepare a map of Louisiana, which in its contour and main waters will\r\nbe perfectly correct, and will give us a skeleton to be filled up with\r\ndetails hereafter. For what lies north of the Missouri, we suppose British\r\nindustry will furnish that. As you live so near to the point of departure\r\nof the lowest expedition, and possess and can acquire so much better\r\nthe information, which may direct that to the best advantage, I have\r\nthought, if Congress should authorize the enterprise, to propose to you\r\nthe unprofitable trouble of directing it. The party would consist of ten\r\nor twelve picked soldiers, volunteers with an officer, under the guidance\r\nof one or two persons qualified to survey and correct by observations of\r\nlatitude and longitude, the latter lunar, and as well informed as we can\r\nget them in the departments of botany, natural history, and mineralogy. I\r\nam told there is a Mr. Walker in your town, and a Mr. Gillespie in North\r\nCarolina, possessing good qualifications. As you know them both, you\r\ncan judge whether both are qualified, should two persons go, or which is\r\nbest, should but one be sent, or whether there is any other person better\r\nqualified than either. Their pay would probably not exceed $1000 a year,\r\nto which would be added their subsistence. All preparations would be to\r\nbe made at Natchez and New Orleans on your order. Instructions similar to\r\nthose of Captain Lewis would go from here, to be added to by what should\r\noccur to yourself, and you would be the centre for the communications from\r\nthe party to the government. Still this is a matter of speculation only,\r\nas Congress are hurrying over their business for adjournment, and may\r\nleave this article of it unfinished. In that case what I have said will be\r\nas if I had not said it.\r\n\r\nThere is such a difference of opinion in Congress as to the government\r\nto be given to Louisiana, that they may continue the present one another\r\nyear. I hope and urge their not doing it, and the establishment of a\r\ngovernment on the spot capable of meeting promptly its own emergencies.\r\nAccept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [19] These ordinates are arithmetical progressionals, each of\r\n         which is double the root of its abscissa, plus unit.

The idea was new to me, and after\r\ntime for reflection I had no opportunity of conversing with you again.\r\nThe federalists know, that _eo nomine_, they are gone forever. Their\r\nobject, therefore, is how to return into power under some other form.\r\nUndoubtedly they have but one means, which is to divide the republicans,\r\njoin the minority, and barter with them for the cloak of their name. I\r\nsay, _join the minority_; because the majority of the republicans not\r\nneeding them, will not buy them. The minority, having no other means of\r\nruling the majority, will give a price for auxiliaries, and that price\r\nmust be principle. It is true that the federalists, needing their numbers\r\nalso, must also give a price, and principle is the coin they must pay in.\r\nThus a bastard system of federo-republicanism will rise on the ruins of\r\nthe true principles of our revolution. And when this party is formed, who\r\nwill constitute the majority of it, which majority is then to dictate?\r\nCertainly the federalists. Thus their proposition of putting themselves\r\ninto gear with the republican minority, is exactly like Roger Sherman's\r\nproposition to add Connecticut to Rhode Island. The idea of forming seven\r\neastern States is moreover clearly to form the basis of a separation of\r\nthe Union. Is it possible that real republicans can be gulled by such\r\na bait? And for what? What do they wish that they have not? Federal\r\nmeasures? That is impossible. Republican measures? Have they them not? Can\r\nany one deny, that in all important questions of principle, republicanism\r\nprevails? But do they want that their individual will shall govern the\r\nmajority? They may purchase the gratification of this unjust wish, for\r\na little time, at a great price; but the federalists must not have the\r\npassions of other men, if, after getting thus into the seat of power,\r\nthey suffer themselves to be governed by their minority. This minority may\r\nsay, that whenever they relapse into their own principles, they will quit\r\nthem, and draw the seat from under them. They may quit them, indeed, but,\r\nin the meantime, all the venal will have become associated with them, and\r\nwill give them a majority sufficient to keep them in place, and to enable\r\nthem to eject the heterogeneous friends by whose aid they get again into\r\npower. I cannot believe any portion of real republicans will enter into\r\nthis trap; and if they do, I do not believe they can carry with them the\r\nmass of their States, advancing so steadily as we see them, to an union\r\nof principle with their brethren. It will be found in this, as in all\r\nother similar cases, that crooked schemes will end by overwhelming their\r\nauthors and coadjutors in disgrace, and that he alone who walks strict and\r\nupright, and who, in matters of opinion, will be contented that others\r\nshould be as free as himself, and acquiesce when his opinion is fairly\r\noverruled, will attain his object in the end. And that this may be the\r\nconduct of us all, I offer my sincere prayers, as well as for your health\r\nand happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                              May 30, 1804.\r\n\r\nAlthough I know that it is best generally to assign no reason for a\r\nremoval from office, yet there are also times when the declaration of a\r\nprinciple is advantageous. Such was the moment at which the New Haven\r\nletter appeared. It explained our principles to our friends, and they\r\nrallied to them. The public sentiment has taken a considerable stride\r\nsince that, and seems to require that they should know again where\r\nwe stand. I suggest therefore for your consideration, instead of the\r\nfollowing passage in your letter to Bowen, \"I think it due to candor at\r\nthe same time to inform you, that I had for some time been determined to\r\nremove you from office, although a successor has not yet been appointed by\r\nthe President, nor the precise time fixed for that purpose communicated\r\nto me;\" to substitute this, \"I think it due to candor at the same time\r\nto inform you, that the President considering that the patronage of\r\npublic office should no longer be confided to one who uses it for active\r\nopposition to the national will, had, some time since, determined to place\r\nyour office in other hands. But a successor not being yet fixed on, I am\r\nnot able to name the precise time when it will take place.\"\r\n\r\nMy own opinion is, that the declaration of this principle will meet the\r\nentire approbation of all moderate republicans, and will extort indulgence\r\nfrom the warmer ones. Seeing that we do not mean to leave arms in the\r\nhands of active enemies, they will care the less at our tolerance of the\r\ninactive. Nevertheless, if you are strongly of opinion against such a\r\ndeclaration, let the letter go as you had written it.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BARON DE HUMBOLDT.\r\n\r\n                                                               June 9, 1804\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson asks leave to observe to Baron de Humboldt that the\r\nquestion of limits of Louisiana, between Spain and the United States is\r\nthis. They claim to hold to the river Mexicana or Sabine, and from the\r\nhead of that northwardly along the heads of the waters of the Mississippi,\r\nto the head of the Red river and so on. We claim to the North river from\r\nits mouth to the source either of its eastern or western branch, thence to\r\nthe head of Red river, and so on. Can the Baron inform me what population\r\nmay be between those lines, of white, red, or black people? And whether\r\nany and what mines are within them? The information will be thankfully\r\nreceived. He tenders him his respectful salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 13, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,--The affectionate sentiments which you have had the goodness\r\nto express in your letter of May the 20th, towards my dear departed\r\ndaughter, have awakened in me sensibilities natural to the occasion,\r\nand recalled your kindnesses to her, which I shall ever remember with\r\ngratitude and friendship. I can assure you with truth, they had made an\r\nindelible impression on her mind, and that to the last, on our meetings\r\nafter long separations, whether I had heard lately of you, and how\r\nyou did, were among the earliest of her inquiries. In giving you this\r\nassurance I perform a sacred duty for her, and, at the same time, am\r\nthankful for the occasion furnished me, of expressing my regret that\r\ncircumstances should have arisen, which have seemed to draw a line of\r\nseparation between us, The friendship with which you honored me has ever\r\nbeen valued, and fully reciprocated; and although events have been passing\r\nwhich might be trying to some minds, I never believed yours to be of that\r\nkind, nor felt that my own was. Neither my estimate of your character,\r\nnor the esteem founded in that, has ever been lessened for a single\r\nmoment, although doubts whether it would be acceptable may have forbidden\r\nmanifestations of it.\r\n\r\nMr. Adams' friendship and mine began at an earlier date. It accompanied\r\nus through long and important scenes. The different conclusions we had\r\ndrawn from our political reading and reflections, were not permitted to\r\nlessen personal esteem; each party being conscious they were the result of\r\nan honest conviction in the other. Like differences of opinion existing\r\namong our fellow citizens, attached them to one or the other of us, and\r\nproduced a rivalship in their minds which did not exist in ours. We never\r\nstood in one another's way; for if either had been withdrawn at any time,\r\nhis favorers would not have gone over to the other, but would have sought\r\nfor some one of homogeneous opinions. This consideration was sufficient\r\nto keep down all jealousy between us, and to guard our friendship from\r\nany disturbance by sentiments of rivalship; and I can say with truth, that\r\none act of Mr. Adams' life, and one only, ever gave me a moment's personal\r\ndispleasure. I did consider his last appointments to office as personally\r\nunkind. They were from among my most ardent political enemies, from whom\r\nno faithful co-operation could ever be expected; and laid me under the\r\nembarrassment of acting through men whose views were to defeat mine, or to\r\nencounter the odium of putting others in their places. It seems but common\r\njustice to leave a successor free to act by instruments of his own choice.\r\nIf my respect for him did not permit me to ascribe the whole blame to\r\nthe influence of others, it left something for friendship to forgive, and\r\nafter brooding over it for some little time, and not always resisting the\r\nexpression of it, I forgave it cordially, and returned to the same state\r\nof esteem and respect for him which had so long subsisted. Having come\r\ninto life a little later than Mr. Adams, his career has preceded mine, as\r\nmine is followed by some other; and it will probably be closed at the same\r\ndistance after him which time originally placed between us. I maintain\r\nfor him, and shall carry into private life, an uniform and high measure of\r\nrespect and good will, and for yourself a sincere attachment.\r\n\r\nI have thus, my dear Madam, opened myself to you without reserve, which\r\nI have long wished an opportunity of doing; and without knowing how it\r\nwill be received, I feel relief from being unbosomed. And I have now\r\nonly to entreat your forgiveness for this transition from a subject of\r\ndomestic affliction, to one which seems of a different aspect. But though\r\nconnected with political events, it has been viewed by me most strongly\r\nin its unfortunate bearings on my private friendships. The injury these\r\nhave sustained has been a heavy price for what has never given me equal\r\npleasure. That you may both be favored with health, tranquillity and long\r\nlife, is the prayer of one who tenders you the assurance of his highest\r\nconsideration and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR PAGE.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 25, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour letter, my dear friend, of the 25th ultimo, is a new proof of\r\nthe goodness of your heart, and the part you take in my loss marks an\r\naffectionate concern for the greatness of it. It is great indeed. Others\r\nmay lose of their abundance, but I, of my want, have lost even the half\r\nof all I had. My evening prospects now hang on the slender thread of\r\na single life. Perhaps I may be destined to see even this last cord of\r\nparental affection broken! The hope with which I had looked forward to the\r\nmoment, when, resigning public cares to younger hands, I was to retire to\r\nthat domestic comfort from which the last great step is to be taken, is\r\nfearfully blighted. When you and I look back on the country over which we\r\nhave passed, what a field of slaughter does it exhibit! Where are all the\r\nfriends who entered it with us, under all the inspiring energies of health\r\nand hope? As if pursued by the havoc of war, they are strewed by the way,\r\nsome earlier, some later, and scarce a few stragglers remain to count the\r\nnumbers fallen, and to mark yet, by their own fall, the last footsteps\r\nof their party. Is it a desirable thing to bear up through the heat of\r\nthe action, to witness the death of all our companions, and merely be the\r\nlast victim? I doubt it. We have, however, the traveller's consolation.\r\nEvery step shortens the distance we have to go; the end of our journey is\r\nin sight, the bed wherein we are to rest, and to rise in the midst of the\r\nfriends we have lost. \"We sorrow not then as others who have no hope;\"\r\nbut look forward to the day which \"joins us to the great majority.\" But\r\nwhatever is to be our destiny, wisdom, as well as duty, dictates that we\r\nshould acquiesce in the will of Him whose it is to give and take away,\r\nand be contented in the enjoyment of those who are still permitted to\r\nbe with us. Of those connected by blood, the number does not depend on\r\nus. But friends we have, if we have merited them. Those of our earliest\r\nyears stand nearest in our affections. But in this too, you and I have\r\nbeen unlucky. Of our college friends (and they are the dearest) how few\r\nhave stood with us in the great political questions which have agitated\r\nour country; and these were of a nature to justify agitation. I did not\r\nbelieve the Lilliputian fetters of that day strong enough to have bound so\r\nmany. Will not Mrs. Page, yourself and family, think it prudent to seek\r\na healthier region for the months of August and September? And may we\r\nnot flatter ourselves that you will cast your eye on Monticello? We have\r\nnot many summers to live. While fortune places us then within striking\r\ndistance, let us avail ourselves of it, to meet and talk over the tales of\r\nother times.\r\n\r\nPresent me respectfully to Mrs. Page, and accept yourself my friendly\r\nsalutations, and assurances of constant affection.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE TYLER.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, June 28, 1801.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 10th instant has been duly received. Amidst\r\nthe direct falsehoods, the misrepresentations of truth, the calumnies\r\nand the insults resorted to by a faction to mislead the public mind,\r\nand to overwhelm those entrusted with its interests, our support is to\r\nbe found in the approving voice of our conscience and country, in the\r\ntestimony of our fellow citizens, that their confidence is not shaken by\r\nthese artifices. When to the plaudits of the honest multitude, the sober\r\napprobation of the sage in his closet is added, it becomes a gratification\r\nof an higher order. It is the sanction of wisdom superadded to the voice\r\nof affection. The terms, therefore, in which you are so good as to express\r\nyour satisfaction with the course of the present administration cannot but\r\ngive me great pleasure. I may err in my measures, but never shall deflect\r\nfrom the intention to fortify the public liberty by every possible means,\r\nand to put it out of the power of the few to riot on the labors of the\r\nmany. No experiment can be more interesting than that we are now trying,\r\nand which we trust will end in establishing the fact, that man may be\r\ngoverned by reason and truth. Our first object should therefore be, to\r\nleave open to him all the avenues to truth. The most effectual hitherto\r\nfound, is the freedom of the press. It is therefore, the first shut up by\r\nthose who fear the investigation of their actions. The firmness with which\r\nthe people have withstood the late abuses of the press, the discernment\r\nthey have manifested between truth and falsehood, show that they may\r\nsafely be trusted to hear everything true and false, and to form a correct\r\njudgment between them. As little is it necessary to impose on their\r\nsenses, or dazzle their minds by pomp, splendor, or forms. Instead of this\r\nartificial, how much surer is that real respect, which results from the\r\nuse of their reason, and the habit of bringing everything to the test of\r\ncommon sense.\r\n\r\nI hold it, therefore, certain, that to open the doors of truth, and to\r\nfortify the habit of testing everything by reason, are the most effectual\r\nmanacles we can rivet on the hands of our successors to prevent their\r\nmanacling the people with their own consent. The panic into which they\r\nwere artfully thrown in 1798, the frenzy which was excited in them\r\nby their enemies against their apparent readiness to abandon all the\r\nprinciples established for their own protection, seemed for awhile to\r\ncountenance the opinions of those who say they cannot be trusted with\r\ntheir own government. But I never doubted their rallying; and they did\r\nrally much sooner than I expected. On the whole, that experiment on their\r\ncredulity has confirmed my confidence in their ultimate good sense and\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nI lament to learn that a like misfortune has enabled you to estimate the\r\nafflictions of a father on the loss of a beloved child. However terrible\r\nthe possibility of such another accident, it is still a blessing for you\r\nof inestimable value that you would not even then descend childless to the\r\ngrave. Three sons, and hopeful ones too, are a rich treasure. I rejoice\r\nwhen I hear of young men of virtue and talents, worthy to receive, and\r\nlikely to preserve the splendid inheritance of self-government, which we\r\nhave acquired and shaped for them.\r\n\r\nThe complement of midshipmen for the Tripoline squadron, is full; and\r\nI hope the frigates have left the Capes by this time. I have, however,\r\nthis day, signed warrants of midshipmen for the two young gentlemen you\r\nrecommended. These will be forwarded by the Secretary of the Navy. He\r\ntells me that their first services will be to be performed on board the\r\ngun boats.\r\n\r\nAccept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                              July 5, 1804.\r\n\r\nWe did not collect the sense of our brethren the other day by regular\r\nquestions, but as far as I could understand from what was said, it\r\nappeared to be,--1. That an acknowledgment of our right to the Perdido,\r\nis a _sine qua non_, and no price to be given for it. 2. No absolute and\r\nperpetual relinquishment of right is to be made of the country east of\r\nthe Rio Bravo del Norte, even in exchange for Florida. [I am not quite\r\nsure that this was the opinion of all.] 3. That a country may be laid\r\noff within which no further settlement shall be made by either party for\r\na given time, say thirty years. This country to be from the North river\r\neastwardly towards the Colorado, or even to, but not beyond the Mexican\r\nor Sabine river. To whatever river it be extended, it might from its\r\nsource run north-west, as the most eligible direction; but a due north\r\nline would produce no restraint that we should feel in twenty years. This\r\nrelinquishment, and two millions of dollars, to be the price of all the\r\nFloridas east of the Perdido, or to be apportioned to whatever part they\r\nwill cede.\r\n\r\nBut on entering into conferences, both parties should agree that, during\r\ntheir continuance, neither should strengthen their situation between the\r\nIberville, Mississippi, and Perdido, nor interrupt the navigation of the\r\nrivers therein. If they will not give such an order instantly, they should\r\nbe told that we have for peace sake only, forborne till they could have\r\ntime to give such an order, but that as soon as we receive notice of their\r\nrefusal to give the order we shall intermit the exercise of our right of\r\nnavigating the Mobile, and protect it, and increase our force there _pari\r\npassu_ with them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, July 7, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--In a letter of the 17th of April, which I wrote you from\r\nMonticello, I observed to you that as the legislative council for the\r\nterritory of Orleans, was to be appointed by me, and our distance was\r\ngreat, and early communication on the subject was necessary, that it ought\r\nto be composed of men of integrity, of understanding, of clear property\r\nand influence among the people, well acquainted with the laws, customs,\r\nand habits of the country, and drawn from the different parts of the\r\nterritory, whose population was considerable. And I asked the favor of you\r\nto inform me of the proper characters, with short sketches of the material\r\noutlines for estimating them; and I observed that a majority should be of\r\nsound American characters long established and esteemed there, and the\r\nrest of French or Spaniards, the most estimable and well affected. When\r\nin daily expectation of an answer from you, I received your favor of May\r\n29th, whereby I perceive that my letter to you has never got to hand. I\r\nmust therefore, at this late day, repeat my request to you, and ask an\r\nearly answer, because after receiving it, I may perhaps have occasion to\r\nconsult you again before a final determination. A letter _written_ any\r\ntime in August will find me at Monticello, near Milton, and had better\r\nbe so directed. A blank commission for a Surveyor and Inspector for the\r\nport of Bayou St. John, will be forwarded to you to be filled up with any\r\nname you approve. I would prefer a native Frenchman, if you can find one\r\nproper and disposed to co-operate with us in extirpating that corruption\r\nwhich has prevailed in those offices under the former government, and had\r\nso familiarized itself as that men, otherwise honest, could look on that\r\nwithout horror. I pray you to be alive to the suppression of this odious\r\npractice, and that you bring to punishment and brand with eternal disgrace\r\nevery man guilty of it, whatever be his station.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO P. MAZZEI.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 18, 1804.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--It is very long, I know, since I wrote you. So constant\r\nis the pressure of business that there is never a moment, scarcely, that\r\nsomething of public importance is not waiting for me. I have, therefore,\r\non a principle of conscience, thought it my duty to withdraw almost\r\nentirely from all private correspondence, and chiefly the trans-Atlantic;\r\nI scarcely write a letter a year to any friend beyond sea. Another\r\nconsideration has led to this, which is the liability of my letters\r\nto miscarry, be opened, and made ill use of. Although the great body\r\nof our country are perfectly returned to their ancient principles, yet\r\nthere remains a phalanx of old tories and monarchists, more envenomed,\r\nas all their hopes become more desperate. Every word of mine which they\r\ncan get hold of, however innocent, however orthodox even, is twisted,\r\ntormented, perverted, and, like the words of holy writ, are made to mean\r\neverything but what they were intended to mean. I trust little, therefore,\r\nunnecessarily in their way, and especially on political subjects. I\r\nshall not, therefore, be free to answer all the several articles of your\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nOn the subject of treaties, our system is to have none with any nation,\r\nas far as can be avoided. The treaty with England has therefore not\r\nbeen renewed, and all overtures for treaty with other nations have been\r\ndeclined. We believe, that with nations as with individuals, dealings may\r\nbe carried on as advantageously, perhaps more so, while their continuance\r\ndepends on a voluntary good treatment, as if fixed by a contract, which,\r\nwhen it becomes injurious to either, is made, by forced constructions,\r\nto mean what suits them, and becomes a cause of war instead of a bond of\r\npeace. We wish to be on the closest terms of friendship with Naples, and\r\nwe will prove it by giving to her citizens, vessels and goods all the\r\nprivileges of the most favored nation; and while we do this voluntarily,\r\nwe cannot doubt they will voluntarily do the same for us. Our interests\r\nagainst the Barbaresques being also the same, we have little doubt she\r\nwill give us every facility to insure them, which our situation may ask\r\nand hers admit. It is not, then, from a want of friendship that we do\r\nnot propose a treaty with Naples, but because it is against our system to\r\nembarrass ourselves with treaties, or to entangle ourselves at all with\r\nthe affairs of Europe. The kind offices we receive from that government\r\nare more sensibly felt, as such, than they would be, if rendered only as\r\ndue to us by treaty.\r\n\r\nFive fine frigates left the Chesapeake the 1st instant for Tripoli, which,\r\nin addition to the force now there, will, I trust, recover the credit\r\nwhich Commodore Morris' two years' sleep lost us, and for which he has\r\nbeen broke. I think they will make Tripoli sensible, that they mistake\r\ntheir interest in choosing war with us; and Tunis also, should she have\r\ndeclared war as we expect, and almost wish.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this little diversion, we pay seven or eight millions of\r\ndollars annually of our public debt, and shall completely discharge it in\r\ntwelve years more. That done, our annual revenue, now thirteen millions\r\nof dollars, which by that time will be twenty-five, will pay the expenses\r\nof any war we may be forced into, without new taxes or loans. The spirit\r\nof republicanism is now in almost all its ancient vigor, five-sixths of\r\nthe people being with us. Fourteen of the seventeen States are completely\r\nwith us, and two of the other three will be in one year. We have now got\r\nback to the ground on which you left us. I should have retired at the end\r\nof the first four years, but that the immense load of tory calumnies which\r\nhave been manufactured respecting me, and have filled the European market,\r\nhave obliged me to appeal once more to my country for a justification. I\r\nhave no fear but that I shall receive honorable testimony by their verdict\r\non those calumnies. At the end of the next four years I shall certainly\r\nretire. Age, inclination and principle all dictate this. My health, which\r\nat one time threatened an unfavorable turn, is now firm. The acquisition\r\nof Louisiana, besides doubling our extent, and trebling our quantity\r\nof fertile country, is of incalculable value, as relieving us from the\r\ndanger of war. It has enabled us to do a handsome thing for Fayette. He\r\nhad received a grant of between eleven and twelve thousand acres north\r\nof Ohio, worth, perhaps, a dollar an acre. We have obtained permission\r\nof Congress to locate it in Louisiana. Locations can be found adjacent to\r\nthe city of New Orleans, in the island of New Orleans and in its vicinity,\r\nthe value of which cannot be calculated. I hope it will induce him to come\r\nover and settle there with his family. Mr. Livingston having asked leave\r\nto return, General Armstrong, his brother-in-law, goes in his place: he is\r\nof the first order of talents.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRemarkable deaths lately, are, Samuel Adams, Edmund Pendleton, Alexander\r\nHamilton, Stephens Thompson Mason, Mann Page, Bellini, and Parson Andrews.\r\nTo these I have the inexpressible grief of adding the name of my youngest\r\ndaughter, who had married a son of Mr. Eppes, and has left two children.\r\nMy eldest daughter alone remains to me, and has six children. This loss\r\nhas increased my anxiety to retire, while it has dreadfully lessened\r\nthe comfort of doing it. Wythe, Dickinson, and Charles Thompson are\r\nall living, and are firm republicans. You informed me formerly of your\r\nmarriage, and your having a daughter, but have said nothing in your late\r\nletters on that subject. Yet whatever concerns your happiness is sincerely\r\ninteresting to me, and is a subject of anxiety, retaining as I do, cordial\r\nsentiments of esteem and affection for you. Accept, I pray you, my sincere\r\nassurances of this, with my most friendly salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, July 22, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR MADAM,--Your favor of the 1st instant was duly received, and I would\r\nnot have again intruded on you, but to rectify certain facts which seem\r\nnot to have been presented to you under their true aspect. My charities\r\nto Callendar are considered as rewards for his calumnies. As early, I\r\nthink, as 1796, I was told in Philadelphia that Callendar, the author\r\nof the Political Progress of Britain, was in that city, a fugitive from\r\npersecution for having written that book, and in distress. I had read\r\nand approved the book; I considered him as a man of genius, unjustly\r\npersecuted. I knew nothing of his private character, and immediately\r\nexpressed my readiness to contribute to his relief, and to serve him. It\r\nwas a considerable time after, that, on application from a person who\r\nthought of him as I did, I contributed to his relief, and afterwards\r\nrepeated the contribution. Himself I did not see till long after, nor\r\never more than two or three times. When he first began to write, he told\r\nsome useful truths in his coarse way; but nobody sooner disapproved of his\r\nwriting than I did, or wished more that he would be silent. My charities\r\nto him were no more meant as encouragements to his scurrilities, than\r\nthose I give to the beggar at my door are meant as rewards for the vices\r\nof his life, and to make them chargeable to myself. In truth, they would\r\nhave been greater to him, had he never written a word after the work for\r\nwhich he fled from Britain. With respect to the calumnies and falsehoods\r\nwhich writers and printers at large published against Mr. Adams, I\r\nwas as far from stooping to any concern or approbation of them, as Mr.\r\nAdams was respecting those of Porcupine, Fenno, or Russel, who published\r\nvolumes against me for every sentence vended by their opponents against\r\nMr. Adams. But I never supposed Mr. Adams had any participation in the\r\natrocities of these editors, or their writers. I knew myself incapable of\r\nthat base warfare, and believed him to be so. On the contrary, whatever\r\nI may have thought of the acts of the administration of that day, I\r\nhave ever borne testimony to Mr. Adams' personal worth; nor was it ever\r\nimpeached in my presence, without a just vindication of it on my part.\r\nI never supposed that any person who knew either of us, could believe\r\nthat either of us meddled in that dirty work. But another fact is, that\r\nI \"liberated a wretch who was suffering for a libel against Mr. Adams.\"\r\nI do not know who was the particular wretch alluded to; but I discharged\r\nevery person under punishment or prosecution under the sedition law,\r\nbecause I considered, and now consider, that law to be a nullity, as\r\nabsolute and as palpable as if Congress had ordered us to fall down and\r\nworship a golden image; and that it was as much my duty to arrest its\r\nexecution in every stage, as it would have been to have rescued from the\r\nfiery furnace those who should have been cast into it for refusing to\r\nworship the image. It was accordingly done in every instance, without\r\nasking what the offenders had done, or against whom they had offended, but\r\nwhether the pains they were suffering were inflicted under the pretended\r\nsedition law. It was certainly possible that my motives for contributing\r\nto the relief of Callendar, and liberating sufferers under the sedition\r\nlaw, might have been to protect, encourage, and reward slander; but they\r\nmay also have been those which inspire ordinary charities to objects of\r\ndistress, meritorious or not, or the obligation of an oath to protect\r\nthe Constitution, violated by an unauthorized act of Congress. Which of\r\nthese were my motives, must be decided by a regard to the general tenor\r\nof my life. On this I am not afraid to appeal to the nation at large, to\r\nposterity, and still less to that Being who sees himself our motives, who\r\nwill judge us from his own knowledge of them, and not on the testimony of\r\nPorcupine or Fenno.\r\n\r\nYou observe, there has been one other act of my administration personally\r\nunkind, and suppose it will readily suggest itself to me. I declare on my\r\nhonor, Madam, I have not the least conception what act was alluded to. I\r\nnever did a single one with an unkind intention. My sole object in this\r\nletter being to place before your attention, that the acts imputed to me\r\nare either such as are falsely imputed, or as might flow from good as well\r\nas bad motives, I shall make no other addition, than the assurances of my\r\ncontinued wishes for the health and happiness of yourself and Mr. Adams.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 15, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter dated the 7th should probably have been of the\r\n14th, as I received it only by that day's post. I return you Monroe's\r\nletter, which is of an awful complexion; and I do not wonder the\r\ncommunications it contains made some impression on him. To a person placed\r\nin Europe, surrounded by the immense resources of the nations there,\r\nand the greater wickedness of their courts, even the limits which nature\r\nimposes on their enterprises are scarcely sensible. It is impossible that\r\nFrance and England should combine for any purpose; their mutual distrust\r\nand deadly hatred of each other admit no co-operation. It is impossible\r\nthat England should be willing to see France re-possess Louisiana, or get\r\nfooting on our continent, and that France should willingly see the United\r\nStates re-annexed to the British dominions. That the Bourbons should\r\nbe replaced on their throne and agree to any terms of restitution, is\r\npossible; but that they and England joined, could recover us to British\r\ndominion, is impossible. If these things are not so, then human reason\r\nis of no aid in conjecturing the conduct of nations. Still, however, it\r\nis our unquestionable interest and duty to conduct ourselves with such\r\nsincere friendship and impartiality towards both nations, as that each\r\nmay see unequivocally, what is unquestionably true, that we may be very\r\npossibly driven into her scale by unjust conduct in the other. I am so\r\nmuch impressed with the expediency of putting a termination to the right\r\nof France to patronize the rights of Louisiana, which will cease with\r\ntheir complete adoption as citizens of the United States, that I hope to\r\nsee that take place on the meeting of Congress. I enclosed you a paragraph\r\nfrom a newspaper respecting St. Domingo, which gives me uneasiness.\r\nStill I conceive the British insults in our harbor as more threatening.\r\nWe cannot be respected by France as a neutral nation, nor by the world\r\nourselves as an independent one, if we do not take effectual measures to\r\nsupport, at every risk, our authority in our own harbors. I shall write to\r\nMr. Wagner directly (that a post may not be lost by passing through you)\r\nto send us blank commissions for Orleans and Louisiana, ready sealed, to\r\nbe filled up, signed and forwarded by us. Affectionate salutations and\r\nconstant esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GOVERNOR CLAIBORNE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 13, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Various circumstances of delay have prevented my forwarding\r\ntill now, the general arrangements of the government of the territory\r\nof Orleans. Enclosed herewith you will receive the commissions. Among\r\nthese is one for yourself as Governor. With respect to this I will\r\nenter into frank explanations. This office was originally destined\r\nfor a person[20] whose great services and established fame would have\r\nrendered him peculiarly acceptable to the nation at large. Circumstances,\r\nhowever, exist, which do not now permit his nomination, and perhaps may\r\nnot at any time hereafter. That, therefore, being suspended and entirely\r\ncontingent, your services have been so much approved as to leave no\r\ndesire to look elsewhere to fill the office. Should the doubts you have\r\nsometimes expressed, whether it would be eligible for you to continue,\r\nstill exist in your mind, the acceptance of the commission gives you time\r\nto satisfy yourself by further experience, and to make the time and manner\r\nof withdrawing; should you ultimately determine on that, agreeable to\r\nyourself. Be assured that whether you continue or retire, it will be with\r\nevery disposition on my part to be just and friendly to you.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI salute you with friendship and respect.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTE:\r\n\r\n    [20] [In the margin is written by the author, \"La Fayette.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY.\r\n\r\n                                             MONTICELLO, September 8, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--As we shall have to lay before Congress the proceedings of the\r\nBritish vessels at New York, it will be necessary for us to say to them\r\nwith certainty which specific aggressions were committed within the common\r\nlaw, which within the admiralty jurisdiction, and which on the high seas.\r\nThe rule of the common law is that wherever you can see from land to land,\r\nall the water within the line of sight is in the body of the adjacent\r\ncounty and within common law jurisdiction. Thus, if in this curvature\r\n[Illustration: Sketch of curve with points marked a, b, and c.] you\r\ncan see from _a_ to_ b_, all the water within the line of sight is within\r\ncommon law jurisdiction, and a murder committed at _c_ is to be tried as\r\nat common law. Our coast is generally visible, I believe, by the time you\r\nget within about twenty-five miles. I suppose that at New York you must be\r\nsome miles out of the Hook before the opposite shores recede twenty-five\r\nmiles from each other. The three miles of maritime jurisdiction is always\r\nto be counted from this line of sight. It will be necessary we should be\r\nfurnished with the most accurate chart to be had of the shores and waters\r\nin the neighborhood of the Hook; and that we may be able to ascertain on\r\nit the spot of every aggression. I presume it would be within the province\r\nof Mr. Gelston to procure such a chart, and to ascertain the positions of\r\nthe offending vessels. If I am right in this, will you be so good as to\r\ninstruct him so to do?\r\n\r\nI think the officers of the federal government are meddling too much\r\nwith the public elections. Will it be best to admonish them privately\r\nor by proclamation? This for consideration till we meet. I shall be at\r\nWashington by the last day of the month. I salute you with affection and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADAMS.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 11, 1804.\r\n\r\nYour letter, Madam, of the 18th of August has been some days received,\r\nbut a press of business has prevented the acknowledgment of it: perhaps,\r\nindeed, I may have already trespassed too far on your attention. With\r\nthose who wish to think amiss of me, I have learned to be perfectly\r\nindifferent; but where I know a mind to be ingenuous, and to need only\r\ntruth to set it to rights, I cannot be as passive. The act of personal\r\nunkindness alluded to in your former letter, is said in your last to have\r\nbeen the removal of your eldest son from some office to which the judges\r\nhad appointed him. I conclude then he must have been a commissioner of\r\nbankruptcy. But I declare to you, on my honor, that this is the first\r\nknowledge I have ever had that he was so. It may be thought, perhaps,\r\nthat I ought to have inquired who were such, before I appointed others.\r\nBut it is to be observed, that the former law permitted the judges\r\nto name commissioners occasionally only, for every case as it arose,\r\nand not to make them permanent officers. Nobody, therefore, being in\r\noffice, there could be no removal. The judges, you well know, have been\r\nconsidered as highly federal; and it was noted that they confined their\r\nnominations exclusively to federalists. The Legislature, dissatisfied with\r\nthis, transferred the nomination to the President, and made the offices\r\npermanent. The very object in passing the law was, that he should correct,\r\nnot confirm, what was deemed the partiality of the judges. I thought\r\nit therefore proper to inquire, not whom they had employed, but whom I\r\nought to appoint to fulfil the intentions of the law. In making these\r\nappointments, I put in a proportion of federalists, equal, I believe, to\r\nthe proportion they bear in numbers through the Union generally. Had I\r\nknown that your son had acted, it would have been a real pleasure to me\r\nto have preferred him to some who were named in Boston, in what was deemed\r\nthe same line of politics. To this I should have been led by my knowledge\r\nof his integrity, as well as my sincere dispositions towards yourself and\r\nMr. Adams.\r\n\r\nYou seem to think it devolved on the judges to decide on the validity of\r\nthe sedition law. But nothing in the Constitution has given them a right\r\nto decide for the executive, more than to the executive to decide for\r\nthem. Both magistrates are equally independent in the sphere of action\r\nassigned to them. The judges, believing the law constitutional, had a\r\nright to pass a sentence of fine and imprisonment; because the power was\r\nplaced in their hands by the Constitution. But the executive, believing\r\nthe law to be unconstitutional, were bound to remit the execution of it;\r\nbecause that power has been confided to them by the Constitution. That\r\ninstrument meant that its coordinate branches should be checks on each\r\nother. But the opinion which gives to the judges the right to decide what\r\nlaws are constitutional, and what not, not only for themselves in their\r\nown sphere of action, but for the Legislature and executive also, in their\r\nspheres, would make the judiciary a despotic branch. Nor does the opinion\r\nof the unconstitutionality, and consequent nullity of that law, remove all\r\nrestraint from the overwhelming torrent of slander, which is confounding\r\nall vice and virtue, all truth and falsehood, in the United States. The\r\npower to do that is fully possessed by the several State Legislatures.\r\nIt was reserved to them, and was denied to the General Government, by\r\nthe Constitution, according to our construction of it. While we deny\r\nthat Congress have a right to control the freedom of the press, we have\r\never asserted the right of the States, and their exclusive right, to do\r\nso. They have accordingly, all of them, made provisions for punishing\r\nslander, which those who have time and inclination, resort to for the\r\nvindication of their characters. In general, the State laws appear to have\r\nmade the presses responsible for slander as far as is consistent with its\r\nuseful freedom. In those States where they do not admit even the truth of\r\nallegations to protect the printer, they have gone too far.\r\n\r\nThe candor manifested in your letter, and which I ever believed you to\r\npossess, has alone inspired the desire of calling your attention, once\r\nmore, to those circumstances of fact and motive by which I claim to be\r\njudged. I hope you will see these intrusions on your time to be, what\r\nthey really are, proofs of my great respect for you. I tolerate with the\r\nutmost latitude the right of others to differ from me in opinion without\r\nimputing to them criminality. I know too well the weakness and uncertainty\r\nof human reason to wonder at its different results. Both of our political\r\nparties, at least the honest part of them, agree conscientiously in the\r\nsame object--the public good; but they differ essentially in what they\r\ndeem the means of promoting that good. One side believes it best done by\r\none composition of the governing powers; the other, by a different one.\r\nOne fears most the ignorance of the people; the other, the selfishness\r\nof rulers independent of them. Which is right, time and experience will\r\nprove. We think that one side of this experiment has been long enough\r\ntried, and proved not to promote the good of the many; and that the\r\nother has not been fairly and sufficiently tried. Our opponents think\r\nthe reverse. With whichever opinion the body of the nation concurs, that\r\nmust prevail. My anxieties on this subject will never carry me beyond\r\nthe use of fair and honorable means, of truth and reason; nor have they\r\never lessened my esteem for moral worth, nor alienated my affections from\r\na single friend, who did not first withdraw himself. Whenever this has\r\nhappened, I confess I have not been insensible to it; yet have ever kept\r\nmyself open to a return of their justice. I conclude with sincere prayers\r\nfor your health and happiness, that yourself and Mr. Adams may long enjoy\r\nthe tranquillity you desire and merit, and see in the prosperity of your\r\nfamily what is the consummation of the last and warmest of human wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. F. MERCER, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, October 9, 1804.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of September 28th, in behalf of Mr. Harwood, was\r\nduly received; the grounds on which one of the competitors stood, set\r\naside of necessity all hesitation. Mr. Hall's having been a member of\r\nthe Legislature, a Speaker of the Representatives, and a member of the\r\nExecutive Council, were evidences of the respect of the State towards\r\nhim, which our respect for the State could not neglect. You say you are\r\nforcibly led to say something on another subject very near your heart,\r\nwhich you defer to another opportunity. I presume it to be on your\r\npolitical situation, and perhaps the degree in which it may bear on our\r\nfriendship. In the first case I declare to you that I have never suffered\r\npolitical opinion to enter into the estimate of my private friendships;\r\nnor did I ever abdicate the society of a friend on that account till he\r\nhad first withdrawn from mine. Many have left me on that account, but\r\nwith many I still preserve affectionate intercourse, only avoiding to\r\nspeak on politics, as with a Quaker or Catholic I would avoid speaking\r\non religion. But I do not apply this to you; for however confidently it\r\nhas been affirmed, I have not supposed that you have changed principles.\r\nWhat in fact is the difference of principle between the two parties here?\r\nThe one desires to preserve an entire independence of the executive and\r\nlegislative branches on each other, and the dependence of both on the same\r\nsource--the free election of the people. The other party wishes to lessen\r\nthe dependence of the Executive and of one branch of the Legislature on\r\nthe people, some by making them hold for life, some hereditary, and some\r\neven for giving the Executive an influence by patronage or corruption\r\nover the remaining popular branch, so as to reduce the elective franchise\r\nto its minimum. I shall not believe you gone over to the latter opinions\r\ntill better evidence than I have had. Yet were it the case, I repeat my\r\ndeclaration that exclusive of political coincidence of opinion, I have\r\nfound a sufficiency of other qualities in you to value and cherish your\r\nfriendship.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. LITHSON.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, January 4, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of December 4th has been duly received. Mr. Duane\r\ninformed me that he meant to publish a new edition of the Notes on\r\nVirginia, and I had in contemplation some particular alterations which\r\nwould require little time to make. My occupations by no means permit me at\r\nthis time to revise the text, and make those changes in it which I should\r\nnow do. I should in that case certainly qualify several expressions in\r\nthe nineteenth chapter, which have been construed differently from what\r\nthey were intended. I had under my eye when writing, the manufacturers\r\nof the great cities in the old countries, at the time present, with whom\r\nthe want of food and clothing necessary to sustain life, has begotten a\r\ndepravity of morals, a dependence and corruption, which renders them an\r\nundesirable accession to a country whose morals are sound. My expressions\r\nlooked forward to the time when our own great cities would get into the\r\nsame state. But they have been quoted as if meant for the present time\r\nhere. As yet our manufacturers are as much at their ease, as independent\r\nand moral as our agricultural inhabitants, and they will continue so as\r\nlong as there are vacant lands for them to resort to; because whenever it\r\nshall be attempted by the other classes to reduce them to the minimum of\r\nsubsistence, they will quit their trades and go to laboring the earth. A\r\nfirst question is, whether it is desirable for us to receive at present\r\nthe dissolute and demoralized handicraftsmen of the old cities of Europe?\r\nA second and more difficult one is, when even good handicraftsmen arrive\r\nhere, is it better for them to set up their trade, or go to the culture\r\nof the earth? Whether their labor in their trade is worth more than their\r\nlabor on the soil, increased by the creative energies of the earth? Had I\r\ntime to revise that chapter, this question should be discussed, and other\r\nviews of the subject taken, which are presented by the wonderful changes\r\nwhich have taken place here since 1781, when the Notes on Virginia were\r\nwritten. Perhaps when I retire, I may amuse myself with a serious review\r\nof this work; at present it is out of the question. Accept my salutations\r\nand good wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. TAYLOR, ESQ.\r\n\r\n                                               WASHINGTON, January 6, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of December 26th has been duly received, as a proof\r\nof your friendly partialities to me, of which I have so often had reason\r\nto be sensible. My opinion originally was that the President of the United\r\nStates should have been elected for seven years, and forever ineligible\r\nafterwards. I have since become sensible that seven years is too long to\r\nbe irremovable, and that there should be a peaceable way of withdrawing\r\na man in midway who is doing wrong. The service for eight years, with\r\na power to remove at the end of the first four, comes nearly to my\r\nprinciple as corrected by experience; and it is in adherence to that,\r\nthat I determine to withdraw at the end of my second term. The danger\r\nis that the indulgence and attachments of the people will keep a man in\r\nthe chair after he becomes a dotard, that re-election through life shall\r\nbecome habitual, and election for life follow that. General Washington\r\nset the example of voluntary retirement after eight years. I shall follow\r\nit. And a few more precedents will oppose the obstacle of habit to any\r\none after awhile who shall endeavor to extend his term. Perhaps it may\r\nbeget a disposition to establish it by an amendment of the Constitution.\r\nI believe I am doing right therefore in pursuing my principle. I had\r\ndetermined to declare my intention, but I have consented to be silent on\r\nthe opinion of friends, who think it best not to put a continuance out\r\nof my power in defiance of all circumstances. There is, however, but one\r\ncircumstance which could engage my acquiescence in another election; to\r\nwit, such a division about a successor, as might bring in a monarchist.\r\nBut that circumstance is impossible. While, therefore, I shall make no\r\nformal declaration to the public of my purpose, I have freely let it be\r\nunderstood in private conversation. In this I am persuaded yourself and\r\nmy friends generally will approve of my views. And should I, at the end\r\nof a second term, carry into retirement all the favor which the first\r\nhas acquired, I shall feel the consolation of having done all the good\r\nin my power, and expect with more than composure the termination of a\r\nlife no longer valuable to others or of importance to myself. Accept my\r\naffectionate salutations and assurances of great esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                                          January 26, 1805.\r\n\r\nThe question arising on Mr. Simons' letter of January 10th is whether\r\nsea-letters shall be given to the vessels of citizens neither born nor\r\nresiding in the United States. Sea-letters are the creatures of treaties.\r\nNo act of the ordinary Legislature requires them. The only treaties now\r\nexisting with us, and calling for them, are those with Holland, Spain,\r\nPrussia, and France. In the two former we have stipulated that when the\r\nother party shall be at war, the vessels belonging to our people shall\r\nbe furnished with sea-letters; in the two latter that the _vessels of\r\nthe neutral_ party shall be so furnished. France being now at war, the\r\nsea-letter is made necessary for our vessels; and consequently it is our\r\nduty to furnish them. The laws of the United States confine registers\r\nto _home-built_ vessels belonging to citizens; but they do not make it\r\nunlawful for citizens to own foreign-built vessels; and the treaties give\r\nthe right of sea-letters to all vessels belonging to citizens.\r\n\r\nBut who are citizens? The laws of registry consider a citizenship obtained\r\nby a foreigner who comes merely for that purpose, and returns to reside\r\nin his own country, as fraudulent, and deny a register to such an one,\r\neven owning home-built vessels. I consider the distinction as sound and\r\nsafe, and that we ought not to give sea-letters to a vessel belonging to\r\nsuch a pseudo-citizen. It compromises our peace, by lending our flag to\r\ncover the goods of one of the belligerents to the injury of the other.\r\nIt produces vexatious searches on the vessels of our real citizens, and\r\ngives to others the participation of our neutral advantages, which belong\r\nto the real citizen only. And inasmuch as an uniformity of rule between\r\nthe different branches of the government is convenient and proper, I would\r\npropose as a rule that sea-letters be given to all vessels _belonging_ to\r\ncitizens under whose ownership of a registered vessel such vessel would be\r\nentitled to the benefits of her register. Affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. NICHOLSON.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, January 29, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Mr. Eppes has this moment put into my hands your letter of\r\nyesterday, asking information on the subject of the gunboats proposed\r\nto be built. I lose no time in communicating to you fully my whole views\r\nrespecting them, premising a few words on the system of fortifications.\r\nConsidering the harbors which, from their situation and importance, are\r\nentitled to defence, and the estimates we have seen of the fortifications\r\nplanned for some of them, this system cannot be completed on a moderate\r\nscale for less than fifty millions of dollars, nor manned in time of\r\nwar, with less than fifty thousand men, and in peace, two thousand.\r\nAnd when done they avail little; because all military men agree, that\r\nwherever a vessel may pass a fort without tacking under her guns, which\r\nis the case at all our seaport towns, she may be annoyed more or less,\r\naccording to the advantages of the position, but can never be prevented.\r\nOur own experience during the war proved this on different occasions. Our\r\npredecessors have, nevertheless, proposed to go into this system, and had\r\ncommenced it. But no law requiring us to proceed, we have suspended it.\r\n\r\nIf we cannot hinder vessels from entering our harbors, we should turn our\r\nattention to the putting it out of their power to lie, or come to, before\r\na town, to injure it. Two means of doing this may be adopted in aid of\r\neach other. 1. Heavy cannon on travelling carriages, which may be moved to\r\nany point on the bank or beach most convenient for dislodging the vessel.\r\nA sufficient number of these should be lent to each seaport town, and\r\ntheir militia trained to them. The executive is authorized to do this; it\r\nhas been done in a small degree, and will now be done more competently.\r\n\r\n2. Having cannon on floating batteries or boats, which may be so stationed\r\nas to prevent a vessel entering the harbor, or force her, after entering,\r\nto depart. There are about fifteen harbors in the United States which\r\nought to be in a state of substantial defence. The whole of these would\r\nrequire, according to the best opinions, two hundred and forty gun-boats.\r\nTheir cost was estimated by Captain Rogers at two thousand dollars\r\neach; but we had better say four thousand dollars. The whole would\r\ncost one million of dollars. But we should allow ourselves ten years to\r\ncomplete it, unless circumstances should force it sooner. There are three\r\nsituations in which the gun-boat may be. 1. Hauled up under a shed, in\r\nreadiness to be launched and manned by the seamen and militia of the town\r\non short notice. In this situation she costs nothing but an enclosure,\r\nor a sentinel to see that no mischief is done to her. 2. Afloat, and with\r\nmen enough to navigate her in harbor and take care of her, but depending\r\non receiving her crew from the town on short warning. In this situation,\r\nher annual expense is about two thousand dollars, as by an official\r\nestimate at the end of this letter. 3. Fully manned for action. Her\r\nannual expense in this situation is about eight thousand dollars, as per\r\nestimate subjoined. When there is general peace, we should probably keep\r\nabout six or seven afloat in the second situation; their annual expense\r\ntwelve to fourteen thousand dollars; the rest all hauled up. When France\r\nand England are at war, we should keep, at the utmost, twenty-five in the\r\nsecond situation; their annual expense, fifty thousand dollars. When we\r\nshould be at war ourselves, some of them would probably be kept in the\r\nthird situation, at an annual expense of eight thousand dollars; but how\r\nmany, must depend on the circumstances of the war. We now possess ten,\r\nbuilt and building. It is the opinion of those consulted, that fifteen\r\nmore would enable us to put every harbor under our view into a respectable\r\ncondition; and that this should limit the views of the present year. This\r\nwould require an appropriation of sixty thousand dollars; and I suppose\r\n_that_ the best way of limiting it, without declaring the number, as\r\nperhaps that sum would build more. I should think it best not to give a\r\ndetailed report, which exposes our policy too much. A bill, with verbal\r\nexplanations, will suffice for the information of the House. I do not\r\nknow whether General Wilkinson would approve the printing his paper. If he\r\nwould, it would be useful.\r\n\r\nAccept affectionate and respectful salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. VOLNEY.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, February 8, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letter of November the 26th came to hand May the 14th; the\r\nbooks some time after, which were all distributed according to direction.\r\nThe copy for the East Indies went immediately by a safe conveyance.\r\nThe letter of April the 28th, and the copy of your work accompanying\r\nthat, did not come to hand till August. That copy was deposited in the\r\nCongressional library. It was not till my return here from my autumnal\r\nvisit to Monticello, that I had an opportunity of reading your work. I\r\nhave read it, and with great satisfaction. Of the first part I am less a\r\njudge than most people, having never travelled westward of Staunton, so as\r\nto know anything of the face of the country; nor much indulged myself in\r\ngeological inquiries, from a belief that the skin-deep scratches which we\r\ncan make or find on the surface of the earth, do not repay our time with\r\nas certain and useful deductions as our pursuits in some other branches.\r\nThe subject of our winds is more familiar to me. On that, the views you\r\nhave taken are always great, supported in their outlines by your facts;\r\nand though more extensive observations, and longer continued, may produce\r\nsome anomalies, yet they will probably take their place in this first\r\ngreat canvas which you have sketched. In no case, perhaps, does habit\r\nattach our choice or judgment more than in climate. The Canadian glows\r\nwith delight in his sleigh and snow; the very idea of which gives me the\r\nshivers. The comparison of climate between Europe and North America,\r\ntaking together its corresponding parts, hangs chiefly on three great\r\npoints. 1. The changes between heat and cold in America are greater\r\nand more frequent, and the extremes comprehend a greater scale on the\r\nthermometer in America than in Europe. Habit, however, prevents these\r\nfrom affecting us more than the smaller changes of Europe affect the\r\nEuropean. But he is greatly affected by ours. 2. Our sky is always clear;\r\nthat of Europe always cloudy. Hence a greater accumulation of heat here\r\nthan there, in the same parallel. 3. The changes between wet and dry are\r\nmuch more frequent and sudden in Europe than in America. Though we have\r\ndouble the rain, it falls in half the time. Taking all these together, I\r\nprefer much the climate of the United States to that of Europe. I think\r\nit a more cheerful one. It is our cloudless sky which has eradicated\r\nfrom our constitutions all disposition to hang ourselves, which we might\r\notherwise have inherited from our English ancestors. During a residence of\r\nbetween six and seven years in Paris, I never, but once, saw the sun shine\r\nthrough a whole day, without being obscured by a cloud in any part of it;\r\nand I never saw the moment, in which, viewing the sky through its whole\r\nhemisphere, I could say there was not the smallest speck of a cloud in it.\r\nI arrived at Monticello, on my return from France, in January; and during\r\nonly two months' stay there, I observed to my daughters, who had been with\r\nme to France, that, twenty odd times within that term, there was not a\r\nspeck of a cloud in the whole hemisphere. Still I do not wonder that an\r\nEuropean should prefer his gray to our azure sky. Habit decides our taste\r\nin this, as in most other cases.\r\n\r\nThe account you give of the yellow fever, is entirely agreeable to what\r\nwe then knew of it. Further experience has developed more and more its\r\npeculiar character. Facts appear to have established that it is originated\r\nhere by a local atmosphere, which is never generated but in the lower,\r\ncloser, and dirtier parts of our large cities, in the neighborhood of\r\nthe water: and that, to catch the disease, you must enter the local\r\natmosphere. Persons having taken the disease in the infected quarter, and\r\ngoing into the country, are nursed and buried by their friends, without\r\nan example of communicating it. A vessel going from the infected quarter,\r\nand carrying its atmosphere in its hold into another State, has given the\r\ndisease to every person who there entered her. These have died in the arms\r\nof their families, without a single communication of the disease. It is\r\ncertainly, therefore, an epidemic, not a contagious disease; and calls on\r\nthe chemists for some mode of purifying the vessel by a decomposition of\r\nits atmosphere, if ventilation be found insufficient. In the long scale\r\nof bilious fevers, graduated by many shades, this is probably the last\r\nand most mortal term. It seizes the native of the place equally with\r\nstrangers. It has not been long known in any part of the United States.\r\nThe shade next above it, called the stranger's fever, has been coëval\r\nwith the settlement of the larger cities in the Southern parts, to wit,\r\nNorfolk, Charleston, New Orleans. Strangers going to these places in the\r\nmonths of July, August, or September, find this fever as mortal as the\r\ngenuine yellow fever. But it rarely attacks those who have resided in\r\nthem some time. Since we have known that kind of yellow fever which is\r\nno respecter of persons, its name has been extended to the stranger's\r\nfever, and every species of bilious fever which produces a black vomit,\r\nthat is to say, a discharge of very dark bile. Hence we hear of yellow\r\nfever on the Alleghany mountains, in Kentucky, &c. This is a matter of\r\ndefinition only; but it leads into error those who do not know how loosely\r\nand how interestedly some physicians think and speak. So far as we have\r\nyet seen, I think we are correct in saying, that the yellow fever, which\r\nseizes on all indiscriminately, is an ultimate degree of bilious fever\r\nnever known in the United States till lately, nor farther South, as yet,\r\nthan Alexandria; and that what they have recently called the yellow fever\r\nin New Orleans, Charleston and Norfolk, is what has always been known in\r\nthose places as confined chiefly to strangers, and nearly as mortal _to\r\nthem_, as the other is to _all_ its subjects. But both grades are local;\r\nthe stranger's fever less so, as it sometimes extends a little into the\r\nneighborhood; but the yellow fever rigorously so, confined within narrow\r\nand well-defined limits, and not communicable out of those limits. Such\r\na constitution of atmosphere being requisite to originate this disease as\r\nis generated only in low, close, and ill-cleansed parts of a town, I have\r\nsupposed it practicable to prevent its generation by building our cities\r\non a more open plan. Take, for instance, the chequer board for a plan.\r\nLet the black squares only be building squares, and the white ones be left\r\nopen, in turf and trees. Every square of houses will be surrounded by four\r\nopen squares, and every house will front an open square. The atmosphere\r\nof such a town would be like that of the country, insusceptible of the\r\nmiasmata which produce yellow fever. I have accordingly proposed that\r\nthe enlargements of the city of New Orleans, which must immediately take\r\nplace, shall be on this plan. But it is only in ease of enlargements to\r\nbe made, or of cities to be built, that this means of prevention can be\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe _genus irritabile vatum_ could not let the author of the Ruins publish\r\na new work, without seeking in it the means of discrediting that puzzling\r\ncomposition. Some one of those holy calumniators has selected from your\r\nnew work every scrap of a sentence, which, detached from its context,\r\ncould displease an American reader. A cento has been made of these, which\r\nhas run through a particular description of newspapers, and excited a\r\ndisapprobation even in friendly minds, which nothing but the reading of\r\nthe book will cure. But time and truth will at length correct error.\r\n\r\nOur countrymen are so much occupied in the busy scenes of life, that they\r\nhave little time to write or invent. A good invention here, therefore,\r\nis such a rarity as it is lawful to offer to the acceptance of a friend.\r\nA Mr. Hawkins of Frankford, near Philadelphia, has invented a machine\r\nwhich he calls a polygraph, and which carries two, three, or four pens.\r\nThat of two pens, with which I am now writing, is best; and is so perfect\r\nthat I have laid aside the copying-press, for a twelve month past, and\r\nwrite always with the polygraph. I have directed one to be made, of which\r\nI ask your acceptance. By what conveyance I shall send it while Havre is\r\nblockaded, I do not yet know. I think you will be pleased with it, and\r\nwill use it habitually as I do; because it requires only that degree of\r\nmechanical attention which I know you to possess. I am glad to hear that\r\nM. Cabanis is engaged in writing on the reformation of medicine. It needs\r\nthe hand of a reformer, and cannot be in better hands than his. Will you\r\npermit my respects to him and the Abbe de la Roche to find a place here?\r\n\r\nA word now on our political state. The two parties which prevailed with so\r\nmuch violence when you were here, are almost wholly melted into one. At\r\nthe late Presidential election I have received one hundred and sixty-two\r\nvotes against fourteen only. Connecticut is still federal by a small\r\nmajority; and Delaware on a poise, as she has been since 1775, and will\r\nbe till Anglomany with her yields to Americanism. Connecticut will be\r\nwith us in a short time. Though the people in mass have joined us, their\r\nleaders had committed themselves too far to retract. Pride keeps them\r\nhostile; they brood over their angry passions, and give them vent in the\r\nnewspapers which they maintain. They still make as much noise as if they\r\nwere the whole nation. Unfortunately, these being the mercantile papers,\r\npublished chiefly in the sea-ports, are the only ones which find their\r\nway to Europe, and make very false impressions there. I am happy to hear\r\nthat the late derangement of your health is going off, and that you are\r\nre-established. I sincerely pray for the continuance of that blessing, and\r\nwith my affectionate salutations, tender you assurances of great respect\r\nand attachment.\r\n\r\nP. S. The sheets which you receive are those of the copying-pen of the\r\npolygraph, not of the one with which I have written.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE TYLER.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, March 29, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your favor of the 17th found me on a short visit to this place,\r\nand I observe in it with great pleasure a continuance of your approbation\r\nof the course we are pursuing, and particularly the satisfaction you\r\nexpress with the last inaugural address. The first was, from the nature of\r\nthe case, all profession and promise. Performance, therefore, seemed to be\r\nthe proper office of the second. But the occasion restricted me to mention\r\nonly the most prominent heads, and the strongest justification of these in\r\nthe fewest words possible. The crusade preached against philosophy by the\r\nmodern disciples of steady habits, induced me to dwell more in showing its\r\neffect with the Indians than the subject otherwise justified.\r\n\r\nThe war with Tripoli stands on two grounds of fact. 1st. It is made known\r\nto us by our agents with the three other Barbary States, that they only\r\nwait to see the event of this, to shape their conduct accordingly. If\r\nthe war is ended by additional tribute, they mean to offer us the same\r\nalternative. 2dly. If peace was made, we should still, and shall ever,\r\nbe obliged to keep a frigate in the Mediterranean to overawe rupture,\r\nor we must abandon that market. Our intention in sending Morris with a\r\nrespectable force, was to try whether peace could be forced by a coercive\r\nenterprise on their town. His inexecution of orders baffled that effort.\r\nHaving broke him, we try the same experiment under a better commander.\r\nIf in the course of the summer they cannot produce peace, we shall recall\r\nour force, except one frigate and two small vessels, which will keep up a\r\nperpetual blockade. Such a blockade will cost us no more than a state of\r\npeace, and will save us from increased tributes, and the disgrace attached\r\nto them. There is reason to believe the example we have set, begins\r\nalready to work on the dispositions of the powers of Europe to emancipate\r\nthemselves from that degrading yoke. Should we produce such a revolution\r\nthere, we shall be amply rewarded for what we have done. Accept my\r\nfriendly salutations, and assurances of great respect and esteem.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR LOGAN.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 11, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--* * * * *\r\n\r\nI see with infinite pain the bloody schism which has taken place among\r\nour friends in Pennsylvania and New York, and will probably take place\r\nin other States. The main body of both sections mean well, but their good\r\nintentions will produce great public evil. The minority, whichever section\r\nshall be the minority, will end in coalition with the federalists, and\r\nsome compromise of principle; because these will not sell their aid for\r\nnothing. Republicanism will thus lose, and royalism gain, some portion\r\nof that ground which we thought we had rescued to good government. I\r\ndo not express my sense of our misfortunes from any idea that they are\r\nremediable. I know that the passions of men will take their course, that\r\nthey are not to be controlled but by despotism, and that this melancholy\r\ntruth is the pretext for despotism. The duty of an upright administration\r\nis to pursue its course steadily, to know nothing of these family\r\ndissensions, and to cherish the good principles of both parties. The war\r\n_ad internecionem_ which we have waged against federalism, has filled\r\nour latter times with strife and unhappiness. We have met it, with pain\r\nindeed, but with firmness, because we believed it the last convulsive\r\neffort of that Hydra, which in earlier times we had conquered in the\r\nfield. But if any degeneracy of principle should ever render it necessary\r\nto give ascendancy to one of the rising sections over the other, I thank\r\nmy God it will fall to some other to perform that operation. The only\r\ncordial I wish to carry into my retirement, is the undivided good will of\r\nall those with whom I have acted.\r\n\r\nPresent me affectionately to Mrs. Logan, and accept my salutations, and\r\nassurances of constant friendship and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JUDGE SULLIVAN.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 21, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--An accumulation of business, which I found on my return here\r\nfrom a short visit to Monticello, has prevented till now my acknowledgment\r\nof your favor of the 14th ultimo. This delay has given time to see the\r\nresult of the contest in your State, and I cannot but congratulate you on\r\nthe advance it manifests, and the certain prospect it offers that another\r\nyear restores Massachusetts to the general body of the nation. You have\r\nindeed received the federal unction of lying and slandering. But who has\r\nnot? Who will ever again come into eminent office, unanointed with this\r\nchrism? It seems to be fixed that falsehood and calumny are to be their\r\nordinary engines of opposition; engines which will not be entirely without\r\neffect. The circle of characters equal to the first stations is not\r\ntoo large, and will be lessened by the voluntary retreat of those whose\r\nsensibilities are stronger than their confidence in the justice of public\r\nopinion. I certainly have known, and still know, characters eminently\r\nqualified for the most exalted trusts, who could not bear up against the\r\nbrutal hackings and hewings of these heroes of Billingsgate. I may say,\r\nfrom intimate knowledge, that we should have lost the services of the\r\ngreatest character of our country, had he been assailed with the degree of\r\nabandoned licentiousness now practised. The torture he felt under rare and\r\nslight attacks, proved that under those of which the federal bands have\r\nshown themselves capable, he would have thrown up the helm in a burst of\r\nindignation. Yet this effect of sensibility must not be yielded to. If we\r\nsuffer ourselves to be frightened from our post by mere lying, surely the\r\nenemy will use that weapon; for what one so cheap to those of whose system\r\nof politics morality makes no part? The patriot, like the Christian,\r\nmust learn that to bear revilings and persecutions is a part of his\r\nduty; and in proportion as the trial is severe, firmness under it becomes\r\nmore requisite and praiseworthy. It requires, indeed, self-command. But\r\nthat will be fortified in proportion as the calls for its exercise are\r\nrepeated. In this I am persuaded we shall have the benefit of your good\r\nexample. To the other falsehoods they have brought forward, should they\r\nadd, as you expect, insinuations of want of confidence in you from the\r\nadministration generally, or myself particularly, it will, like their\r\nother falsehoods, produce in the public mind a contrary inference.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI tender you my friendly and respectful salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUNBAR.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 25, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your several letters, with the portions of your journals,\r\nforwarded at different times, have been duly received; and I am now\r\nputting the journal into the hands of a person properly qualified to\r\nextract the results of your observations, and the various interesting\r\ninformation contained among them, and bring them into such a compass as\r\nmay be communicated to the Legislature. Not knowing whether you might not\r\nintend to make a map yourself, of the course of the river, he will defer\r\nthat to the last part of his work, on the possibility that we may receive\r\nit from yourself. Your observations on the difficulty of transporting\r\nbaggage from the head of the Red river to that of the Arkansas, with\r\nthe dangers from the seceding Osages residing on the last river, have\r\ndetermined me to confine the ensuing mission to the ascent of the Red\r\nriver to its source, and to descend the same river again, which will\r\ngive an opportunity of better ascertaining that which, in truth, next\r\nto the Missouri, is the most interesting water of the Mississippi. You\r\nwill accordingly receive instructions to this effect, from the Secretary\r\nof War. Dr. Hunter does not propose to take a part in this mission, and\r\nwe suppose that Mr. George Davis, a deputy of Mr. Briggs, will be the\r\nfittest person to take the direction of the expedition, and Col. Freeman\r\nas an assistant, and successor, in case of accident, to the principal.\r\nStill, these propositions are submitted to your control, as being better\r\nacquainted with both characters. I write to Gov. Claiborne, to endeavor\r\nto get a passport from the Marquis of Casa-Calvo, for our party, as a\r\nprotection from any Spaniards who may be fallen in with on the route. We\r\noffer to receive one or two persons, to be named by him, and subsisted by\r\nus into the party, as a proof that the expedition is merely scientific,\r\nand without any views to which Spain could take exception. The best\r\nprotection against the Indians will be the authority to confer with them\r\non the subject of commerce. Such conferences should be particularly held\r\nwith the Arkansas and Panis, residing on the Red river, and everything\r\npossible be done to attach them to us affectionately. In the present\r\nstate of things between Spain and us, we should spare nothing to secure\r\nthe friendship of the Indians within reach of her. While Capt. Lewis'\r\nmission was preparing, as it was understood that his reliance for his\r\nlongitudes must be on the lunar observations taken, as at sea, with the\r\naid of a time-keeper, and I knew that a thousand accidents might happen\r\nto that in such a journey as his, and thus deprive us of the principal\r\nobject of the expedition, to wit, the ascertaining the geography of that\r\nriver, I set myself to consider whether in making observations at land,\r\nthat furnishes no resource which may dispense with the time-keeper, so\r\nnecessary at sea. It occurred to me that as we can always have a meridian\r\nat land, that would furnish what the want of it at sea obliges us to\r\nsupply by the time-keeper. Supposing Capt. Lewis then furnished with\r\na meridian, and having the requisite tables and nautical almanac with\r\nhim,--first, he might find the right ascension of the moon, when on the\r\nmeridian of Greenwich, on any given day; then find by observation when\r\nthe moon should attain that right ascension (by the aid of a known star),\r\nand measure her distance in that moment from his meridian. This distance\r\nwould be the difference of longitude between Greenwich and the place of\r\nobservation. Or secondly, observe the moon's passage over his meridian,\r\nand her right ascension at that moment. See by the tables the time at\r\nGreenwich when she had that right ascension. That gives her distance\r\nfrom the meridian of Greenwich, when she was on his meridian. Or thirdly,\r\nobserve the moon's distance from his meridian at any moment, and her right\r\nascension at that moment; and find from the tables her distance from the\r\nmeridian of Greenwich, when she had that right ascension, which will give\r\nthe distance of the two meridians. This last process will he simplified\r\nby taking, for the moment of observation, that of an appulse of the\r\nmoon and a known star, or when the moon and a known star are in the same\r\nvertical. I suggested this to Mr. Briggs, who considered it as correct\r\nand practicable, and proposed communicating it to the Philosophical\r\nSociety; but I observed that it was too obvious not to have been thought\r\nof before, and supposed it had not been adopted in practice, because\r\nof no use at sea, where a meridian cannot be had, and where alone the\r\nnations of Europe had occasion for it. Before his confirmation of the\r\nidea, however, Capt. Lewis was gone. In conversation afterwards with Baron\r\nHumboldt, he observed that the idea was correct, but not new; that I would\r\nfind it in the third volume of Delalande. I received two days ago the\r\nthird and fourth volumes of Montuela's History of Mathematics, finished\r\nand edited by Delalande; and find, in fact, that Morin and Vanlangren,\r\nin the seventeenth century, proposed observations of the moon on the\r\nmeridian, but it does not appear whether they meant to dispense with the\r\ntime-keeper. But a meridian at sea being too impracticable, their idea was\r\nnot pursued. The purpose of troubling you with these details, is to submit\r\nto your consideration and decision whether any use can be made of them\r\nadvantageously in our future expeditions, and particularly that up the Red\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nYour letter on the current of the Mississippi, and paper on the same\r\nsubject, corrected at once my doubts on your theory of the currents\r\nof that river. Constant employment in a very different line permits\r\nme to turn to philosophical subjects only when some circumstance\r\nforces them on my attention. No occurrence had called my mind to this\r\nsubject, particularly since I had first been initiated into the original\r\nTorricellian doctrine of the velocities at different depths, being in\r\nthe sub-duplicate ratio of the depths. And though Buat had given me his\r\nbook while at Paris, your letter was the first occasion of my turning\r\nto it, and getting my mind set to rights to a certain degree. There is a\r\nsubsequent work by Bernard, which is said to have furnished corrections\r\nand additions to Buat; but I have never seen it.\r\n\r\nThe work we are now doing is, I trust, done for posterity, in such a way\r\nthat they need not repeat it. For this we are much indebted to you, not\r\nonly for the labor and time you have devoted to it, but for the excellent\r\nmethod of which you have set the example, and which I hope will be the\r\nmodel to be followed by others. We shall delineate with correctness the\r\ngreat arteries of this great country. Those who come after us will extend\r\nthe ramifications as they become acquainted with them, and fill up the\r\ncanvas we begin. With my acknowledgments for your zealous aid in this\r\nbusiness, accept my friendly salutations, and assurances of great esteem\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTOR SIBLEY.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, May 27, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I have been some time a debtor for your letters of March\r\n20th and September 2d, of the last year. A constant pressure of things\r\nwhich will not admit delay, prevents my acknowledging with punctuality\r\nthe letters I receive, although I am not insensible to the value of\r\nthe communications, and the favor done me in making them. To these\r\nacknowledgments I propose to add a solicitation of a literary kind,\r\nto which I am led by your position, favorable to this object, and by a\r\npersuasion that you are disposed to make to science those contributions\r\nwhich are within your convenience. The question whether the Indians of\r\nAmerica have emigrated from another continent, is still undecided. Their\r\nvague and imperfect traditions can satisfy no mind on that subject. I\r\nhave long considered their languages as the only remaining monument of\r\nconnection with other nations, or the want of it, to which we can now have\r\naccess. They will likewise show their connections with one another. Very\r\nearly in life, therefore, I formed a vocabulary of such objects as, being\r\npresent everywhere, would probably have a name in every language; and my\r\ncourse of life having given me opportunities of obtaining vocabularies\r\nof many Indian tribes, I have done so on my original plan, which though\r\nfar from being perfect, has the valuable advantage of identity, of thus\r\nbringing the languages to the same points of comparison. A letter from you\r\nto General Dearborne, giving valuable information respecting the Indians\r\nwest of the Mississippi and south of the Arkansas, presents a much longer\r\nlist of tribes than I had expected; and the relations in which you stand\r\nwith them, and the means of intercourse these will furnish, induce me to\r\nhope you will avail us of your means of collecting their languages for\r\nthis purpose. I enclose you a number of my blank vocabularies, to lessen\r\nyour trouble as much as I can. I observe you mention several tribes which,\r\nhaving an original language of their own, nevertheless have adopted\r\nsome other, common to other tribes. But it is their original languages\r\nI wish to obtain. I am in hopes you will find persons situated among\r\nor near most of the tribes, who will take the trouble of filling up a\r\nvocabulary. No matter whether the orthography used be English, Spanish,\r\nFrench, or any other, provided it is stated what the orthography is. To\r\nsave unnecessary trouble, I should observe that I already possess the\r\nvocabularies of the Attacapas and Chetimachas, and no others within the\r\nlimits before mentioned. I have taken measures for obtaining those north\r\nof the Arcansa, and already possess most of the languages on this side\r\nthe Mississippi. A similar work, but on a much greater scale, has been\r\nexecuted under the auspices of the late empress of Russia, as to the red\r\nnations of Asia, which, however, I have never seen. A comparison of our\r\ncollection with that will probably decide the question of the sameness\r\nor difference of origin, although it will not decide which is the mother\r\ncountry, and which the colony. You will receive from Gen. Dearborne some\r\nimportant instructions with respect to the Indians. Nothing must be spared\r\nto convince them of the justice and liberality we are determined to use\r\ntowards them, and to attach them to us indissolubly. Accept my apologies\r\nfor the trouble I am giving you, with my salutations and assurances of\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THOMAS PAINE.\r\n\r\n                                                  WASHINGTON, June 5, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Your letters, Nos. 1, 2, 3, the last of them dated April the\r\n20th, were received April the 26th. I congratulate you on your retirement\r\nto your farm, and still more that it is of a character so worthy of your\r\nattention. I much doubt whether the open room on your second story will\r\nanswer your expectations. There will be a few days in the year in which it\r\nwill be delightful, but not many. Nothing but trees, or Venetian blinds,\r\ncan protect it from the sun. The semi-cylindrical roof you propose will\r\nhave advantages. You know it has been practised on the cloth market at\r\nParis. De Lorme, the inventor, shows many forms of roofs in his book\r\nto which it is applicable. I have used it at home for a dome, being one\r\nhundred and twenty degrees of an oblong octagon, and in the capitol we\r\nunite two quadrants of a sphere by a semi-cylinder; all framed in De\r\nLorme's manner. How has your planing machine answered? Has it been tried\r\nand persevered in by any workmen?\r\n\r\nFrance has become so jealous of our conduct as to St. Domingo (which in\r\ntruth is only the conduct of our merchants), that the offer to become a\r\nmediator would only confirm her suspicions. Bonaparte, however, expressed\r\nsatisfaction at the paragraph in my message to Congress on the subject of\r\nthat commerce. With respect to the German redemptioners, you know I can do\r\nnothing unless authorized by law. It would be made a question in Congress,\r\nwhether any of the enumerated objects to which the Constitution authorizes\r\nthe money of the Union to be applied, would cover an expenditure for\r\nimporting settlers to Orleans. The letter of the revolutionary sergeant\r\nwas attended to by General Dearborne, who wrote to him informing him how\r\nto proceed to obtain his land.\r\n\r\nDoctor Eustis' observation to you, that \"certain paragraphs in the\r\nNational Intelligencer\" respecting my letter to you, \"supposed to be\r\nunder Mr. Jefferson's direction, had embarrassed Mr. Jefferson's friends\r\nin Massachusetts; that they appeared like a half denial of the letter,\r\nor as if there was something in it not proper to be owned, or that needed\r\nan apology,\" is one of those mysterious half confidences difficult to be\r\nunderstood. That tory printers should think it advantageous to identify me\r\nwith that paper, the Aurora, &c., in order to obtain ground for abusing\r\nme, is perhaps fair warfare. But that any one who knows me personally\r\nshould listen one moment to such an insinuation, is what I did not expect.\r\nI neither have, nor ever had, any more connection with those papers than\r\nour antipodes have; nor know what is to be in them until I see it in\r\nthem, except proclamations and other documents sent for publication. The\r\nfriends in Massachusetts who could be embarrassed by so weak a weapon\r\nas this, must be feeble friends indeed. With respect to the letter, I\r\nnever hesitated to avow and to justify it in conversation. In no other\r\nway do I trouble myself to contradict anything which is said. At that\r\ntime, however, there were certain anomalies in the motions of some of our\r\nfriends, which events have at length reduced to regularity.\r\n\r\nIt seems very difficult to find out what turns things are to take in\r\nEurope. I suppose it depends on Austria, which, knowing it is to stand in\r\nthe way of receiving the first hard blows, is cautious of entering into\r\na coalition. As to France and England we can have but one wish, that they\r\nmay disable one another from injuring others.\r\n\r\nAccept my friendly salutations, and assurances of esteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                                MONTICELLO, August 7, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--On a view of our affairs with Spain, presented me in a letter\r\nfrom C. Pinckney, I wrote you on the 23d of July, that I thought we should\r\noffer them the _status quo_, but immediately proposed provincial alliance\r\nwith England. I have not yet received the whole correspondence. But the\r\nportion of the papers now enclosed to you, confirm me in the opinion of\r\nthe expediency of a treaty with England, but make the offer of the _status\r\nquo_ more doubtful. The correspondence will probably throw light on that\r\nquestion; from the papers already received I infer a confident reliance\r\non the part of Spain on the omnipotence of Bonaparte, but a desire of\r\nprocrastination till peace in Europe shall leave us without an ally.\r\nGeneral Dearborne has seen all the papers. I will ask the favor of you to\r\ncommunicate them to Mr. Gallatin and Mr. Smith. From Mr. Gallatin I shall\r\nask his first opinion, preparatory to the stating formal questions for\r\nour ultimate decision. I am in hopes you can make it convenient to see\r\nand consult with Mr. Smith and General Dearborne, unless the latter should\r\ncome on here where I can do it myself. On the receipt of your own ideas,\r\nMr. Smith's and the other gentlemen, I shall be able to form points for\r\nour final consideration and determination.\r\n\r\nI enclose you some communications from the Mediterranean. They show\r\nBarron's understanding in a very favorable view. When you shall have\r\nperused them, be so good as to enclose them to the Secretary of the Navy.\r\nAccept my fervent wishes for the speedy recovery of Mrs. Madison, and your\r\nspeedy visit to this quarter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 25, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I confess that the enclosed letter from General Turreau excites\r\nin me both jealousy and offence in undertaking, and without apology, to\r\nsay in what manner to receive and treat Moreau within our own country. Had\r\nTurreau been here longer he would have known that the national authority\r\npays honors to no foreigners. That the State authorities, municipalities\r\nand individuals, are free to render whatever they please, voluntarily,\r\nand free from restraint, by us; and he ought to know that no part of the\r\ncriminal sentence of another country can have any effect here. The style\r\nof that government in the Spanish business, was calculated to excite\r\nindignation; but it was a case in which that might have done injury.\r\nBut the present is a case which would justify some notice in order to\r\nlet them understand we are not of those powers who will receive and\r\nexecute mandates. I think the answer should show independence as well as\r\nfriendship. I am anxious to receive the opinions of our brethren after\r\ntheir review and consideration of the Spanish papers. I am strongly\r\nimpressed with a belief of hostile and treacherous intentions against\r\nus on the part of France, and that we should lose no time in securing\r\nsomething more than a mutual friendship with England.\r\n\r\nNot having heard from you for some posts, I have had a hope you were\r\non the road, and consequently that Mrs. Madison was re-established. We\r\nare now in want of rain, having had none in the last ten days. In your\r\nquarter I am afraid they have been much longer without it. We hear great\r\ncomplaints from F. Walker's, Lindsay's, Maury's, &c., of drought. Accept\r\naffectionate salutations, and assurances of constant friendship.\r\n\r\nP. S. I suppose Kuhn, at Genoa, should have new credentials.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECRETARY OF STATE.\r\n\r\n                                               MONTICELLO, August 27, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Yours of the 20th has been received, and in that a letter from\r\nCasinore, and another from Mrs. Ciracchi; but those from Turreau and to\r\nUpryo were not enclosed. Probably the former was what came to me by the\r\npreceding post, respecting Moreau; if so, you have my opinion on it in my\r\nlast. Considering the character of Bonaparte, I think it material at once\r\nto let him see that we are not of the powers who will receive his orders.\r\n\r\nI think you have misconceived the nature of the treaty I thought we should\r\npropose to England. I have no idea of committing ourselves immediately\r\nor independently of our further will to the war. The treaty should be\r\nprovisional only, to come into force on the event of our being engaged\r\nin war with either France or Spain during the present war in Europe.\r\nIn that event we should make common cause, and England should stipulate\r\nnot to make peace without our obtaining the objects for which we go to\r\nwar, to wit, the acknowledgment by Spain of the rightful boundaries of\r\nLouisiana (which we should reduce to our minimum by a secret article) and\r\n2, indemnification for spoliations, for which purpose we should be allowed\r\nto make reprisal on the Floridas and _retain them_ as an indemnification.\r\nOur co-operation in the war (if we should actually enter into it) would\r\nbe sufficient consideration for Great Britain to engage for its object;\r\nand it being generally known to France and Spain that we had entered into\r\ntreaty with England, would probably ensure us a peaceable and immediate\r\nsettlement of both points. But another motive much more powerful would\r\nindubitably induce England to go much further. Whatever ill-humor may at\r\ntimes have been expressed against us by individuals of that country, the\r\nfirst wish of every Englishman's heart is to see us once more fighting\r\nby their sides against France; nor could the king or his ministers do an\r\nact so popular as to enter into an alliance with us. The nation would not\r\nweigh the consideration by grains and scruples. They would consider it as\r\nthe price and pledge of an indissoluble friendship. I think it possible\r\nthat for such a provisional treaty their general guarantee of Louisiana\r\nand the Floridas. At any rate we might try them. A failure would not make\r\nour situation worse. If such a one could be obtained we might await our\r\nown convenience for calling up the _casus fœderis_. I think it important\r\nthat England should receive an overture as early as possible, as it\r\nmight prevent her listening to terms of peace. If I recollect rightly,\r\nwe had instructed Moreau, when he went to Paris, to settle the deposit;\r\nif he failed in that object to propose a treaty to England immediately.\r\nWe could not be more engaged to secure the deposit then than we are\r\nthe country now, after paying fifteen millions for it. I do expect,\r\ntherefore, that, considering the present state of things as analogous to\r\nthat, and virtually within his instructions, he will very likely make the\r\nproposition to England. I write my thoughts freely, wishing the same from\r\nthe other gentlemen, that seeing and considering the ground of each others\r\nopinions we may come as soon as possible to a result. I propose to be in\r\nWashington by the 2d of October. By that time I hope we shall be ripe for\r\nsome conclusion.\r\n\r\nI have desired Mr. Barnes to pay my quota of expenses relating to the\r\nMarseilles cargo, whatever you will be so good as to notify him that it\r\nis. I wish I could have heard that Mrs. Madison's course of recovery were\r\nmore speedy. I now fear we shall not see you but in Washington. Accept for\r\nher and yourself my affectionate salutations, and assurances of constant\r\nesteem and respect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. MADISON.\r\n\r\n                                            MONTICELLO, September 16, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--The enclosed letter from General Armstrong furnishes matter\r\nfor consideration. You know the French considered themselves entitled\r\nto the Rio Bravo, and that Laussal declared his orders to be to receive\r\npossession to that limit, but not to Perdido; and that France has to us\r\nbeen always silent as to the western boundary, while she spoke decisively\r\nas to the eastern. You know Turreau agreed with us that neither party\r\nshould strengthen themselves in the disputed country during negotiation;\r\nand Armstrong, who says Monroe concurs with him, is of opinion, from the\r\ncharacter of the Emperor, that were we to restrict ourselves to taking\r\nthe posts on the west side of the Mississippi, and threaten a cessation of\r\nintercourse with Spain, Bonaparte would interpose efficiently to prevent\r\nthe quarrel from going further. Add to these things the fact that Spain\r\nhas sent five hundred colonists to St. Antonio, and one hundred troops to\r\nNacogdoches, and probably has fixed or prepared a post at the Bay of St.\r\nBernard, at Matagordo. Supposing, then, a previous alliance with England\r\nto guard us in the worst event, I should propose that Congress should\r\npass acts, 1, authorizing the executive to suspend intercourse with Spain\r\nat discretion; 2, to dislodge the new establishments of Spain between\r\nthe Mississippi and Bravo; and 3, to appoint commissioners to examine\r\nand ascertain all claims for spoliation that they might be preserved for\r\nfuture indemnification. I commit these ideas merely for consideration, and\r\nthat the subject may be matured by the time of our meeting at Washington,\r\nwhere I shall be myself on the 2d of October. I have for some time feared\r\nI should not have the pleasure of seeing you either in Albemarle or\r\nOrange, from a general observation of the slowness of surgical cases.\r\nHowever, should Mrs. Madison be well enough for you to come to Orange, I\r\nwill call on you on my way to Washington, if I can learn you are at home.\r\nGeneral Dearborne is here. His motions depend on the stage. Accept for\r\nMrs. Madison and yourself affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\nP. S. I am afraid Bowdoin's journey to England will furnish a ground for\r\nPinckney's remaining at Madrid. I think he should be instructed to leave\r\nit immediately, and Bowdoin might as well, perhaps, delay going there till\r\ncircumstances render it more necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. GALLATIN.\r\n\r\n                                              WASHINGTON, October 18, 1805.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--I had detained the letter of Mr. Merry on Foster's claims of\r\nfreedom from importing duties, in expectation that Mr. Madison's return\r\nwould enable him, you and myself, to confer on it. If the case presses,\r\nI will express my opinion on it. Every person diplomatic _in his own\r\nright_, is entitled to the privileges of the law of nations, in his own\r\nright. Among these is the receipt of all packages unopened and unexamined\r\nby the country which receives him. The usage of nations has established\r\nthat this shall liberate whatever is imported _bonâ fide_ for his own use,\r\nfrom paying any duty. A government may control the number of diplomatic\r\ncharacters it will receive; but if it receives them it cannot control\r\ntheir rights while _bonâ fide_ exercised. Thus Dr. Franklin, Mr. Adams,\r\nColonel Humphreys, and myself, all residing at Paris at the same time,\r\nhad all of us our importation duty free. Great Britain had an ambassador\r\nand a minister plenipotentiary there, and an ambassador extra for several\r\nyears; all three had their entries free. In most countries this privilege\r\nis permanent. Great Britain is niggardly, and allows it only on the first\r\narrival. But in this as she treats us only as _she does_ the most favored\r\nnations, so we should treat her as _we do_ the most favored nations. If\r\nthese principles are right, Mr. Foster is duty free. If you concur, let it\r\nbe so settled. If you think differently, let it lie for Madison's opinion.\r\nColonel Monroe, in a letter of May, from Madrid, expressed impatience to\r\nget back to London that he might get to America before the equinox. It was\r\nthe first I had heard of his having any thought of coming here, and though\r\nequivocally expressed, I thought he meant only a visit. In subsequent\r\nletters from Paris and London, down to August 16, he says nothing of\r\ncoming; on the contrary, he has re-opened a particular negotiation. The\r\nmotives which led him to wish to arrive before the equinox would prevent\r\nhis venturing between the equinox and winter. I think, therefore, he has\r\nno fixed idea of coming away. Accept affectionate salutations.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DOCTORS ROGERS AND SLAUGHTER.\r\n\r\n                                                 WASHINGTON, March 2, 1806.\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I have received the favor of your letter of February the 2d,\r\nand read with thankfulness its obliging expressions respecting myself.\r\nI regret that the object of a letter from persons whom I so much esteem,\r\nand patronized by so many other respectable names, should be beyond the\r\nlaw which a mature consideration of circumstances has prescribed for my\r\nconduct. I deem it the duty of every man to devote a certain portion of\r\nhis income for charitable purposes; and that it is his further duty to\r\nsee it so applied as to do the most good of which it is capable. This\r\nI believe to be best insured, by keeping within the circle of his own\r\ninquiry and information the subjects of distress to whose relief his\r\ncontributions shall be applied. If this rule be reasonable in private\r\nlife, it becomes so necessary in my situation, that to relinquish it\r\nwould leave me without rule or compass. The applications of this kind from\r\ndifferent parts of our own, and from foreign countries, are far beyond any\r\nresources within my command. The mission of Serampore, in the East Indies,\r\nthe object of the present application, is but one of many items. However\r\ndisposed the mind may feel to unlimited good, our means having limits,\r\nwe are necessarily circumscribed by them. They are too narrow to relieve\r\neven the distresses under my own eye; and to desert these for others\r\nwhich we neither see nor know, is to omit doing a certain good for one\r\nwhich is uncertain. I know, indeed, there have been splendid associations\r\nfor effecting benevolent purposes in remote regions of the earth. But no\r\nexperience of their effect has proved that more good would not have been\r\ndone by the same means employed nearer home. In explaining, however, my\r\nown motives of action, I must not be understood as impeaching those of\r\nothers. Their views are those of an expanded liberality. Mine may be too\r\nmuch restrained by the law of usefulness. But it is a law to me, and with\r\nminds like yours, will be felt as a justification. With this apology,\r\nI pray you to accept my salutations, and assurances of high esteem and\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MR. DUANE.\r\n\r\n                                                WASHINGTON, March 22, 1806.\r\n\r\nI thank you, my good Sir, cordially, for your letter of the 12th, which\r\nhowever I did not receive till the 20th. It is a proof of sincerity, which\r\nI value above all things; as, between those who practise it, falsehood and\r\nmalice work their efforts in vain. There is an enemy somewhere endeavoring\r\nto sow discord among us. Instead of listening first, then doubting, and\r\nlastly believing anile tales handed round without an atom of evidence, if\r\nmy friends will address themselves to me directly, as you have done, they\r\nshall be informed with frankness and thankfulness. There is not a truth\r\non earth which I fear or would disguise. But secret slanders cannot be\r\ndisarmed, because they are secret. Although you desire no answer, I shall\r\ngive you one to those articles admitting a short answer, reserving those\r\nwhich require more explanation than the compass of a letter admits, to\r\nconversation on your arrival here. And as I write this for your personal\r\nsatisfaction, I rely that my letter will, under no circumstances, be\r\ncommunicated to any mortal, because you well know how every syllable from\r\nme is distorted by the ingenuity of my political enemies.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, then, I have had less communication, directly or\r\nindirectly, with the republicans of the east, this session, than I\r\never had before. This has proceeded from accidental circumstances, not\r\nfrom design. And if there be any coolness between those of the south\r\nand myself, it has not been from me towards them. Certainly there has\r\nbeen no other reserve than to avoid taking part in the divisions among\r\nour friends. That Mr. R. has openly attacked the administration is\r\nsufficiently known. We were not disposed to join in league with Britain,\r\nunder any belief that she is fighting for the liberties of mankind,\r\nand to enter into war with Spain, and consequently France. The House\r\nof Representatives were in the same sentiment, when they rejected Mr.\r\nR.'s resolutions for raising a body of regular troops for the western\r\nservice. We are for a peaceable accommodation with all those nations,\r\nif it can be effected honorably. This, perhaps, is not the only ground\r\nof his alienation; but which side retains its orthodoxy, the vote of\r\neighty-seven to eleven republicans may satisfy you; but you will better\r\nsatisfy yourself on coming here, where alone the true state of things can\r\nbe known, and where you will see republicanism as solidly embodied on all\r\nessential points, as you ever saw it on any occasion.\r\n\r\nThat there is only one minister who is not opposed to me, is\r\ntotally unfounded. There never was a more harmonious, a more cordial\r\nadministration, nor ever a moment when it has been otherwise. And while\r\ndifferences of opinion have been always rare among us, I can affirm, that\r\nas to present matters, there was not a single paragraph in my message to\r\nCongress, or those supplementary to it, in which there was not a unanimity\r\nof concurrence in the members of the administration. The fact is, that in\r\nordinary affairs every head of a department consults me on those of his\r\ndepartment, and where anything arises too difficult or important to be\r\ndecided between us, the consultation becomes general.\r\n\r\nThat there is an ostensible cabinet and a concealed one, a public\r\nprofession and concealed counteraction, is false.\r\n\r\nThat I have denounced republicans by the epithet of Jacobins, and declared\r\nI would appoint none but those called moderates of both parties, and that\r\nI have avowed or entertain any predilection for those called the third\r\nparty, or Quids, is in every tittle of it false.\r\n\r\nThat the expedition of Miranda was countenanced by me, is an absolute\r\nfalsehood, let it have gone from whom it might; and I am satisfied it is\r\nequally so as to Mr. Madison. To know as much of it as we could was our\r\nduty, but not to encourage it.\r\n\r\nOur situation is difficult; and whatever we do is liable to the criticisms\r\nof those who wish to represent it awry. If we recommend measures in a\r\npublic message, it may be said that members are not sent here to obey the\r\nmandates of the President, or to register the edicts of a sovereign. If we\r\nexpress opinions in conversation, we have then our Charles Jenkinsons, and\r\nback-door counsellors. If we say nothing, \"we have no opinions, no plans,\r\nno cabinet.\" In truth it is the fable of the old man, his son and ass,\r\nover again.\r\n\r\nThese are short facts which may suffice to inspire you with caution,\r\nuntil you can come here and examine for yourself. No other information\r\ncan give you a true insight into the state of things; but you will have no\r\ndifficulty in understanding them when on the spot. In the meantime, accept\r\nmy friendly salutations and cordial good wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO VOL.
