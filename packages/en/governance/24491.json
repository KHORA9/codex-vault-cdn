VI.--DECEMBER, 1864--NO. VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARMY: ITS ORGANIZATION AND MOVEMENTS\r\n\r\n_FIFTH PAPER._\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore the enlightenment derived from the sad experiences of our present\r\ncivil contest, upon the incidents of protracted warfare, probably most\r\npersons conceived of war as a scene of constant activity--a series of\r\nmarches, battles, and sieges, with but few intervals of repose. History\r\nrecords only the active portions of war, taking but little account of\r\nthe long periods consumed in the preliminary processes of organization\r\nand discipline, in the occupation of camps and cantonments, in the\r\nstationary watches of opposing armies, lying in the front of each other,\r\nboth too weak for aggressive movements, but each strong enough to\r\nprevent such movements on the part of its opponent. Such matters, if\r\nnoticed at all, are recorded in a few sentences, making no impression on\r\nthe reader. Novels of the 'Charles O'Malley' class have also given\r\nincorrect ideas. Every page relates some adventure--every scene gleams\r\nwith sabres and bayonets. Our three years' experience has taught us that\r\nthe greater portion of an army's existence is spent in inactivity; that\r\ncampaigning is performed only through one half of the year, and of that\r\ntime probably not over one third is occupied in progressive movements.\r\nIn the campaign of 1861, the only marches of the Army of the Potomac\r\nwere to the battle field of Bull Run and the retreat. In 1862, after a\r\nmarch of fifteen miles to Fairfax Court House and returning, the army\r\nwas transferred to Fortress Monroe and moved to Yorktown, where some\r\nweeks were passed in the trenches; it then proceeded up the Peninsula,\r\nand laid a month before Richmond; retreated to Harrison's Landing, and\r\nlaid another month; returned to Fortress Monroe, and was shipped to the\r\nvicinity of Washington, marched for about a month, fought at Antietam,\r\nand then laid in camp a month; moved to Warrenton and remained a\r\nfortnight; proceeded to Fredericksburg and continued in camp all winter,\r\nexcept making the short movements which led to the battle of December,\r\nand the ineffective attempt to turn the rebel left, known as the 'mud\r\nmarch.' In all this long campaign, from March to December, a period of\r\nnearly nine months, spent in various operations, more than five months\r\nwere passed in stationary camps--most of the time occupied, it is true,\r\nin picketing, entrenching, and other duties incident to positive\r\nmilitary operations in proximity to an enemy, but very different from\r\nthe duties connected with marching and fighting. The campaign of 1863\r\ncomprised a still smaller period of active movements. Commencing in\r\nApril with the battle of Chancellorsville, it continued till the march\r\nto Mine Run in October--seven months; but considerable more than half\r\nthe time was spent in camps at Falmouth, Warrenton, and Culpepper. The\r\ngreat campaign now in progress has consumed (at the time this article is\r\nwritten) three months, commencing after a six-months' interval of\r\ninaction, and already half the time has been spent in the trenches at\r\nPetersburg.\r\n\r\nSince so large a portion of the time of an army is passed in camps, that\r\nbranch of military science which governs the arrangement of forces when\r\nstationary, is one of considerable importance. It is in camps that\r\narmies are educated, that all the details of organization are\r\nsystematized, that the _morale_ of troops is cultivated, that a round of\r\nlaborious though monotonous duties is performed. Nothing is so trying to\r\nthe temper of the individuals composing an army as a long season in a\r\nstationary camp; nothing has more effect for good or for evil upon the\r\narmy in the aggregate, than the mode in which the time, at such a\r\nseason, is occupied. The commander who does not exercise care to have\r\nhis camps pitched in the proper localities, to insure the observance of\r\nhygienic rules, and to keep his men employed sufficiently in military\r\nexercises, will have discontented, unhealthy, and indolent troops.\r\n\r\nThe words 'camps' and 'cantonments' are frequently used in the\r\nnewspapers without any discrimination; but they denote two entirely\r\ndifferent methods of sheltering troops. A camp is defined to be the\r\nplace where troops are established in tents, in huts, or in bivouac;\r\nwhile cantonments are inhabited places which troops occupy for shelter\r\nwhen not put in barracks. Of camps there are several kinds, according to\r\nthe purposes to be effected by their establishment, such as the nightly\r\ncamps while upon the march, camps of occupation, camps in line of\r\nbattle, &c. Cantonments are most frequently used when, during the\r\nwinter, or other considerable period of inactivity, it is necessary to\r\ndistribute an army over a large district of country, so as to guard a\r\nnumber of points. We have not had any instance of cantonment, properly\r\nspeaking, during the present war; but in Europe this method of disposing\r\ntroops is frequently adopted.\r\n\r\nThe scenes ensuing upon the arrival of an army corps at its camping\r\nground for a night, after a day's march, are very lively, often amusing,\r\nand sometimes present picturesque effects. Where the country traversed\r\nby the army is known to the commander, he is able to designate the\r\nnightly camps of the different corps with precision; if, on account of\r\nignorance of the country, this cannot be done, places are approximately\r\nindicated upon the information given by maps or extracted from the\r\ninhabitants, or procured by reconnoitring parties. Usually, however, the\r\ncommander possesses considerable topographical information, procured by\r\nhis officers in the advance with the cavalry and light troops, so that\r\nhe can fix the nightly camps in such a manner that the various corps\r\nshall all be upon the same line, and lie within supporting distances.\r\nThe vicinity of streams is invariably selected for a camp, if other\r\ncircumstances permit. When a corps arrives within a mile or two of its\r\ndestination, the commander sends forward some of his staff officers\r\n(accompanied by a cavalry guard, if the country is suspicious), and\r\nthese officers select the different localities for the camps of the\r\ndivisions, of the artillery, the cavalry, and the trains, care being\r\ntaken to give all equal facilities for wood and water, and at the same\r\ntime to take advantage of the features of the country for military\r\npurposes, such as the guarding of roads in all directions, the\r\nestablishment of the picket line, &c. The leading division arrives\r\nperhaps at 5 P.M., and its commander is shown to the locality assigned\r\nhim. He immediately distributes the ground to the brigades, and the\r\ntroops, as fast as they arrive, filing into the designated spots, occupy\r\nbut a few moments in the necessary formalities by which disorder is\r\nprevented; then each man quickly spreads his little tent upon the place\r\nwhich in the military order belongs to him, a general din of cheerful\r\nvoices arises, a unanimous rush is made to the water, cooking fires are\r\nkindled in all directions, and in ten minutes a scene of (it may be)\r\nutter desolation becomes full of life and activity. For a couple of\r\nhours the columns continue to file in, until all the hillsides are\r\ncovered with tents. Then, far into the night, is heard the braying of\r\nmules, the shouts of drivers, and the rattling of wheels, as the heavy\r\nwagon trains toil to the place of rest. All through the evening prevails\r\nthat peculiar, cheerful din of a camp, as peculiar and characteristic as\r\nthe roar of a great city; gradually the noises decline, the bugles and\r\ndrums sound the tattoo, the fires grow dim, and the vast mass of hardy,\r\nresolute humanity is asleep--all except the two or three score of sick\r\nand dying men, wasted by fever, who have been jolted all day over the\r\nrough roads in the ambulances, and now groan and writhe in delirium upon\r\ntheir narrow stretchers in the camp hospitals.\r\n\r\nCamps designed to cover and guard a country, are constructed when the\r\narmy has not sufficient strength to advance, or when the season\r\nprevents, or some other cause interferes with the prosecution of\r\nhostilities, while at the same time it is necessary to occupy a portion\r\nof the hostile territory. We have had numerous examples of this kind of\r\ncamps--indeed, our armies occupy them generally while lying inactive\r\nduring the winter. The character of the ground must always determine the\r\nshape and features of such a camp, but unless peculiar modifying\r\ncircumstances dictate otherwise, the general form is that of the arc of\r\na circle. This, with extensions at the sides to cover the flanks, and a\r\nrear guard, is the best for protection. The extent of this kind of camp\r\nis governed by circumstances, but is much greater, generally, than would\r\nbe supposed. The camp of an army of 100,000 men, designed to cover any\r\nconsiderable district of territory, in a country where hills and rivers\r\nassist in giving protection, might have a front (including flanking\r\nparties of cavalry) of from 30 to 50 miles, and a depth of from 10 to\r\n20; besides a continuous chain of forces in the rear, guarding\r\ncommunications with the base of supplies, from 10 to 50 miles distant.\r\n\r\nCamps in line of battle are generally established when opposing armies,\r\nlying in proximity, must be on the alert for attacks. They cover but\r\nlittle more ground than is required for the manoeuvres of the force,\r\nand are so arranged that, in case of probable conflict, the troops can\r\nassume immediately the formations of battle. Such camps are arranged in\r\ntwo or three lines, adapted to the natural features of the country for\r\ndefence. The approach of the enemy having been communicated from the\r\noutposts, the tents are rapidly struck, the baggage loaded and sent to\r\nthe rear, and in an hour the army is free from all encumbrances, and\r\nready to meet the advancing foe. Usually, when armies lie in contact,\r\nexpecting battle, the troops bivouac--no tents being pitched except at\r\nthe headquarters of superior commanders, and at other places\r\nsufficiently in the rear to be free from immediate danger. The troops\r\nmay be obliged to remain thus for a day or two, no fires being permitted\r\nin the advanced lines, so that their positions may not be indicated.\r\n\r\nThe season for the suspension of active hostilities having arrived, it\r\nis necessary for the commander of an army to select some place in which\r\nhis forces can remain for the winter--where they will have sufficient\r\nfacilities for fuel and water, where their health can be preserved,\r\nwhere they can be protected against surprises or annoyance, where the\r\ncountry can be covered and guarded, and where the supplies can be drawn\r\nwith security from the base of operations. After a due consideration of\r\nall the intelligence that can be obtained upon these points, the\r\ncommander issues his general directions, the various corps move to their\r\ndesignated positions, and preparations for the habitations of the winter\r\nare made. Each corps commander, either personally or by his staff\r\nofficers, makes a survey of his ground, and assigns the positions of his\r\ndivisions. If within a few miles of the enemy, he throws detachments of\r\nobservation toward the front, and then proceeds to establish his picket\r\nline, usually some three or five miles in advance of his main line.\r\nPrecautions for security being thus adopted, more minute inspections of\r\nthe ground are made, so that unhealthy positions may be avoided. The\r\ntroops, being placed, immediately proceed to clear the sites of their\r\nrespective encampments, and wagons are set to work to bring in logs with\r\nwhich huts may be constructed. In about a week thousands of diminutive\r\nlog houses arise, roofed with the shelter tents of the soldiers, or,\r\nwhen the occupants have sufficient handicraft ability, with rough\r\nshingles. Shelters are erected, as far as possible, for the animals,\r\ngenerally being nothing more than frameworks covered with pine brush. If\r\nthere are lumber mills in the vicinity, they are set to work, and boards\r\nsawed for floors to the tents and hospitals. The adjacent forests now\r\nbegin to disappear rapidly, leaving nothing but an unsightly array of\r\nstumps; for a regiment is entitled to about two hundred cords of wood\r\nper month as fuel, and in a well-wooded country, where the men can\r\nconveniently cut for themselves, much more is consumed. Every regiment\r\nrequires, therefore, about eight or ten acres of woodland per month. An\r\narmy of a hundred regiments will, in the course of a winter, denude\r\nseveral square miles of trees, so that (in the proportion which woodland\r\ngenerally bears to that which is cleared) a space of country equal to a\r\ncounty may be stripped of its timber. The men, having made themselves\r\ncomfortable, are now called on to form working parties, and put the\r\nroads leading to the depots and the various camps in good order,\r\ngenerally corduroying them, so as to be passable during the winter;\r\nbridges are made over streams, drainage perfected, &c. In a few weeks,\r\nthe chief portion of the labor of preparing a winter's camp is\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nThe sanitary regulations for camps are very stringent and comprehensive.\r\nThe suggestions of experience as to the details by which the diseases\r\nincident to camp life can be prevented, are embodied in orders, and it\r\nis the duty of the medical officers and of the inspectors to see that\r\nthey are observed. For instance, it is not permitted to have the floors\r\nof the huts lower than the external ground, and the men are required to\r\nkeep pine boughs between their blankets and the earth. The method in\r\nwhich a camp shall be drained, and the offal disposed of, is prescribed.\r\nThe cleanliness of the men is enforced. A rigorous system of reports\r\nupon these and many other particulars exists, so that negligences are\r\ncorrected.\r\n\r\nThe military occupations which relieve the monotony of camp life are\r\ndrilling and picketing. It is in the latter that officers and men find\r\nchange and freedom, though it often involves severe exposure. The\r\nordinary detail for this duty in a corps averages perhaps eight hundred\r\nto one thousand men, who are changed usually every three days. If the\r\ncountry be well settled, some opportunities are presented during that\r\ninterval for intercourse with the 'natives;' but in Virginia, it must be\r\nconfessed, the attractions of this kind are few. The secession ladies\r\nare not over well disposed to any wearers of Yankee uniforms, and though\r\nmany of them are willing to bestow a few soft words in exchange for tea,\r\ncoffee, and sugar, they are not liberal of social courtesies. The young\r\nman who joins our armies expecting to realize for himself the love\r\nadventures he has seen recorded in novels, will find the Southern ladies\r\nless given to romance than the damsels of Spain or Mexico. They are\r\ninclined, also, to be treacherous, as the fate of several gallant\r\nofficers, who have gone stealthily beyond the lines to spend an evening\r\nwith fair rebel sirens, and found themselves delivered to guerillas, has\r\nshown. Nevertheless, the experience of others never warns an adventurous\r\nyouth, and opportunities frequently arise for practical jokes. During\r\nthe winter of 1862-'3, while the army was encamped on the Rappahannock,\r\nan officer was fascinated by the charms of a fair widow who resided just\r\nbeyond the lines, and frequently made evening visits to her. His\r\ncompanions, being aware of this, formed a party, on a bitter January\r\nnight, and proceeding to the widow's house, surrounded it, and sending\r\nwithin some who were strangers to him, they announced themselves as\r\nbelonging to the rebel army, and captured the enamored lover,\r\nblindfolded, led him out, and mounted him. Crestfallen and moody with,\r\nthoughts of his disgraceful situation, cursing, perhaps, the wiles of\r\nthe enchantress, to whom he attributed it, he was made to ride many\r\nweary miles, and then, being dismounted, and the bandage removed from\r\nhis eyes, he found himself at his own camp, where he was greeted with\r\nuproarious laughter.\r\n\r\nThe duties incident to picketing and outpost stations are so important\r\nthat several works by distinguished authors have been written concerning\r\nthem, but most of the rules are of too technical a character for recital\r\nin these papers. The friends of soldiers will, however, take interest in\r\nsome general statements. The picket line consists of three\r\nportions--first, the stations of the main guard; second, some distance\r\nin advance of these, the picket stations; and third, some two hundred\r\nyards in advance of these, the stations of the sentinels. If the country\r\nis open and hilly, the latter need not be posted closely together, but\r\nin a wooded country they must be quite numerous. It is their duty not to\r\nallow any person to pass their line; and if a force of the enemy, too\r\nstrong to be resisted, approaches, they fall back on the pickets. These\r\nshould be stationed where they can command the main avenues of approach,\r\nand offer resistance to the advanced parties of the enemy. After such\r\nresistance becomes useless, the various pickets fall back on the grand\r\nguard, which offers a more determined contest. The advance of the enemy\r\nshould by these means have been delayed for a couple of hours, affording\r\ntime for the troops to get under arms and take the order of battle.\r\n\r\nThe following diagram exhibits the general arrangement of picketing:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet the line A B represent a chain of sentinels on a mile of picket\r\nfront, C D a line of picket stations, and E the grand guard. The whole\r\nforce of men may perhaps be three hundred, of whom two thirds will\r\nremain at E, posted advantageously upon some eminence protected in part\r\nby a stream and commanding an open country. The remaining one hundred\r\nwill be distributed among the picket stations and thrown forward as\r\nsentinels. The whole arrangement is supervised by an officer of\r\nrank--usually a colonel. With a disposition like the above in front of\r\nevery division in an army, it is obviously impossible for any\r\nconsiderable force of an enemy to approach without detection.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest practical difficulties our armies have experienced\r\nhas been connected with the system of picketing. The South having been\r\ngreatly impoverished in those portions traversed by the contending\r\narmies, and the people entirely destitute of luxuries, there are\r\ninnumerable applications from residents outside of the pickets for\r\nadmission within the lines, in order to trade with officers, for the\r\npurpose of procuring in return articles from our well-supplied\r\ncommissariat. Various other necessities of the people appeal for a\r\nmodified degree of rigor in regard to picket arrangements, so that our\r\narmies are never free from the presence of rebel inhabitants, traversing\r\nthem in all directions. Perfectly familiar with the country, they are\r\nable to detect any weakly guarded places, and undoubtedly, in frequent\r\ninstances, after receiving the kindest treatment, return to their homes\r\nconveying such information to guerillas as enables these prowlers to\r\npenetrate through by-roads and seize animals and straggling soldiers. As\r\na precaution against such annoyances, a very judicious arrangement was\r\nmade last winter by the provost marshal general of the Army of the\r\nPotomac. He established certain points on the picket line at which\r\ntraffic might be conducted, and forbade admission to citizens. Some\r\nrigorous system like this is very necessary.\r\n\r\nThe social life of camps is, however, the topic of chief interest. The\r\nquestion is often asked, Is the life of a soldier demoralizing? The\r\nanswer must be, 'Yes,' but not for the reasons generally supposed. The\r\nopportunities for vice and dissoluteness are really less than at home.\r\nThe hundred thousand men in an army use less liquor than the same number\r\nof men in a city. In fact, liquor is nearly inaccessible to the soldier\r\nwhen on the march. For other kinds of vice the temptations are few. The\r\ndemoralization arises from the terrible monotony of a prolonged camp,\r\nwhich produces listlessness, indolence, and a devotion to small\r\namusements; deranges and reverses the whole system of active life, as it\r\nis seen at home; renders a man uncouth; disqualifies soldiers for\r\nanything else than the trade of war. To the officer in his tent and to\r\nthe soldier in his log hut, while the cold rains are beating without,\r\nand the ground is knee deep with mud, there is a constant temptation to\r\nfind amusement in cards. Gambling thus becomes a pastime too generally\r\nadopted. The books sent to the army are not always of the character best\r\nadapted to the circumstances. Moral essays and tracts will not be very\r\neagerly sought for by men whose principal object is to kill time. The\r\nreading matter needed is the kind afforded by the periodicals of the\r\nday, unobjectionable novels, biographies, works of travel, etc.\r\n\r\nCamp life has, however, its pleasures, and it must not be supposed that\r\nall succumb to its enervating influences, or that any great number yield\r\nthemselves entirely to its demoralizing effects. The period of military\r\nservice among our volunteers is too short to permit its full influence\r\nto be experienced, and the connections of our soldiers with their homes\r\ntoo intimate to allow them to subside completely into the routine\r\nveterans, whose social, mental, and moral nature is altogether lost and\r\nabsorbed in the new and artificial military nature imposed on them.\r\n\r\nWar collects many characters of peculiar idiosyncrasies, and jumbles\r\nthem strangely together, so that curious associations are produced. In\r\nany collection of men upon a staff or in a regiment, gathered from\r\ndifferent localities, will be found characters of the most opposite and\r\nincongruous elements. There will be the youth who has never before\r\ntravelled beyond his own village, and is full of small anecdotes of the\r\npersons who have figured in his little world; and the silent and\r\nreserved man of middle age, who, if he can be induced to talk, can tell\r\nof many a wild scene in all quarters of the world in which he has been a\r\nparticipant, since he stealthily left his native home, a boy of sixteen.\r\nThere are men who have passed through all the hardships of life, who\r\nhave been soldiers in half a dozen European armies, or miners in\r\nCalifornia and Australia, or sailors; and men who have always had wealth\r\nat their disposal, and spent years in foreign travel, viewing the world\r\nonly under its sunniest aspects. There are many officers grown gray\r\nwhile filling subordinate capacities at posts on the Western prairies\r\nand mountains, who can relate many interesting anecdotes of their\r\ncompanions--the men now prominent in military affairs; and there are\r\nofficers of high rank, recently emerged from civil life, who nourish\r\nprodigiously in self-glorification upon their brief warlike experience.\r\nThere are brave men, and men whose courage is suspected; quiet men, and\r\nmen of opinionated perversity; quick-witted men, and men whose profound\r\nstupidity makes them continual butts for all kinds of practical jokes;\r\nrefined, educated, poetical men, and men of boorish habits. In short,\r\nany camp presents such specimens of humanity as would be furnished if\r\nall the ingredients of character and experience that compose the world\r\nhad been collected in a huge pepper box and sprinkled miscellaneously\r\nthroughout the army.\r\n\r\nIn such associations there are of course many occasions for extracting\r\ninteresting and comical conversation and incident. Jokes of all kinds\r\nare constantly on the wing, and no one can consider himself safe from\r\ncollision with them. Ridiculous nicknames become attached--no one knows\r\nhow--to the most dignified characters, and altogether usurp the places\r\nof the genuine cognomens. No person possesses the art of concealment to\r\nsuch a degree that all his foibles and weaknesses will escape\r\nobservation in the companionship of a camp; and when discovered, the\r\ntreatment of them is merciless just in proportion to the care with which\r\nthey had been hidden. All pretensions will be penetrated, all disguises\r\nunmasked. Every man finds himself placed according to his exact status,\r\nno matter how well contrived his arrangements for passing himself off\r\nfor more than his par value. Many an officer, whom the newspapers\r\ndelight to praise, because he is over courteous to correspondents, and\r\ntakes precautions to have all his achievements published, has a camp\r\nreputation far different from that by which he is known to the public.\r\n\r\nOpinions of all kinds flourish in the army as vigorously as in the outer\r\nworld. There are ardent theorists of the progressive order, full of\r\nschemes for radical reforms, and old fogies believing in nothing except\r\nwhat they lament to see is fast becoming obsolete. There are students\r\nand practical men, authors and mechanics, editors, lawyers, doctors,\r\nclergymen, school teachers, actors, artists, singers, and\r\nrepresentatives of all kinds of trades and avocations. All are now on\r\nthe same platform, and, for a time, class distinctions disappear beneath\r\nthe assimilating conditions of the new profession. Political strifes\r\noccur, but are rarely virulent. Generally the association together of\r\nmen holding different political views, in a common cause, and subject to\r\nthe same dangers, is tacitly accepted as the occasion for an armistice.\r\nBut politics of all kinds are represented. There are of course\r\nAbolitionists, Republicans, Unionists, and War Democrats; but, strangely\r\nenough, there are also Copperheads, Peace Democrats, peace-at-any-price\r\nmen, and even secession sympathizers. Why extremists of the latter\r\nclasses should have joined the army voluntarily cannot be surmised; but\r\nthere they are, and, moreover, they do their duty. There are some traits\r\nof original manhood so strong that even the poison of treasonable\r\npolitics cannot overcome them.\r\n\r\nThe daily routine of camp life in a regiment can be told in a few words.\r\nThe plan of a regimental camp as laid down in the army regulations is\r\ngenerally conformed to, with some variations recommended by the\r\ncharacter of the camping ground. The following diagram exhibits the\r\nplan:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nREFERENCE.\r\n\r\n  N.C.S. Non-commissioned staff.\r\n  AST. SURG. Assistant surgeon.\r\n  M. Major.\r\n  Q.M. Quartermaster.\r\n  LT. CL. Lieutenant-colonel.\r\n  CL. Colonel.\r\n  ADJT. Adjutant.\r\n  SURG. Surgeon.\r\n\r\nIn our armies the full allowances of camp equipage are not permitted.\r\nField and staff officers have only three wall tents, and company\r\nofficers only the same shelter tents as the men. The trains very rarely\r\nencamp with the regiments. The tents of the men front on streets from\r\nfifteen to twenty feet wide, each company having a street of its own,\r\nand there is much competition as to the adornment of these. Many\r\nregimental camps are decorated with evergreens in an exceedingly\r\ntasteful manner--particularly during warm weather--chapels, arches,\r\ncolonnades, etc., being constructed of rude frameworks, so interwoven\r\nwith pine boughs that they present a very elegant appearance.\r\n\r\nThe daily life of a camp is as follows: At an hour appointed by orders,\r\nvarying according to the season of the year, the camp is roused by the\r\nreveille. The old notion that soldiers should be waked before daybreak\r\nin all seasons and all weathers has fortunately been exploded, and the\r\nreveille is not generally sounded in winter till six o'clock. In\r\npleasant weather the men are formed upon the color line, where they\r\nstack their arms. Breakfast is the next matter in order: after that the\r\nmounting of the guard for the day and the detail of detachments for\r\npicket and other duties. The prisoners are put to work in cleaning up\r\nthe camp, and squad drills occupy the morning. About noon the dinner\r\ncall is sounded; then come more drills and in the latter part of the\r\nafternoon the dress parade of the regiment. This closes the military\r\nlabors of the day. In the evening there are schools for instructions in\r\ntactics, and the time is passed in any amusements that may offer\r\nthemselves. About half past eight the tattoo is beaten, when every one,\r\nnot absent on duty, must be in camp ready to answer to his name; and\r\nshortly after, the beat of taps proclaims that the military day is\r\nended, and lights must be extinguished--a regulation not very strictly\r\nenforced. Thus pass the days of camp life.\r\n\r\nVery different are those assemblages of huts down among the pine forests\r\nof Virginia from the pleasant villages, the thriving towns, and the\r\nprosperous cities of the North--very different the life of the soldier\r\nfrom that which he enjoyed before rebellion sought to sever the country\r\nwhich from his cradle he had been taught to consider 'one and\r\ninseparable.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHORISMS.--NO. XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Query for the Thoughtful.--May we not justly say that _spirit_,\r\neverywhere, in its various degrees, rules over matter, setting its\r\nforces at defiance for the time, and yet never interfering with their\r\ncontinued operations?\r\n\r\nThis seems a great law of the universe. The power of life, wherever\r\nguided by _will_, whether in beast or man, or even where we can only\r\nventure to speak of instinct, thus asserts its superiority. Within its\r\nappointed range, the laws of the material world are evidently subject to\r\nits control. Iron may be firmly held together by the attraction of\r\ncohesion: but man wills its severance, and it is effected.\r\n\r\nNor does it contravene the general assertion here made, that we act by\r\nopposing one natural force to another. The rising of the sledge hammer,\r\nto fall with a force more than its own, is just as much against the laws\r\nof matter as the breaking of the iron beneath its blows.\r\n\r\nAll _power_, so far as we can judge, is spiritual--_i.e._, originates in\r\nspirit, and is exerted in obedience to _will_, or to something\r\nequivalent.\r\n\r\nNor, again, will it avail an objector to say that _spirit_ is also under\r\nlaw as well as matter. The laws of the one sphere, at all events, are\r\nnot those of the other. They may have their relations, but they are not\r\nthose of equality. Spirit is sovereign--matter subject; or, if in any\r\ncase it should be otherwise, it is from some weak refusal of the spirit\r\nto assert its own power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nÆNONE:\r\n\r\nA TALE OF SLAVE LIFE IN ROME.\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nGliding softly beneath the shrubbery, and beneath one of the side\r\ncolonnades, Leta gained the house unperceived, passing Sergius, who\r\nloitered where she had been sitting, upon the coping of the fountain\r\nbasin. His friends had departed, bearing away with them his gold and\r\nmuch else that was of value; and he, with the consciousness of evil\r\nbesetting him on every side, had morbidly wandered out to try if in the\r\ncool air he could compose his thoughts to sobriety. As he sat rocking to\r\nand fro, and humming to himself broken snatches of song, Leta stood\r\nunder one of the arches of the court, glowering at him, and half hoping\r\nthat he would lose his balance and fall into the water behind. It was\r\nnot deep enough to drown him, but if it had been, she felt in no mood to\r\nrescue him. In a few moments, however, the fresh breeze, partially\r\ndissipating the fumes of the wine which he had drunk, somewhat revived\r\nhim; making him more clearly conscious of his misfortunes, indeed, but\r\nengendering in him, for the instant, a new and calmer state of feeling,\r\nwhich was not sobriety, but which differed from either his former\r\ncareless recklessness or maddening ferocity. And in this new phase of\r\nmind, he sat and revolved and re-revolved, in ever-recurring sequence,\r\nthe things that had befallen him, and his changed position in the world.\r\n\r\nAlone now, for she, Ænone, had left him. Left him for a stripling of a\r\nslave--a mere creature from the public market. What was the loss of gold\r\nand jewels and quarries to this! And how could he ever hold up his head\r\nagain, with this heavy shame upon it! For there could be no\r\ndoubt;--alas! no. Had he not seen her press a kiss upon the slave's\r\nforehead? Had she not tenderly raised the menial's head upon her knee\r\nwith caressing pity? And, throughout all, had she attempted one word of\r\njustification? Yes, alone in the world now, with no one to love or care\r\nfor him! For she must be put away from him forever; she must never call\r\nhim husband more. That was a certain thing. But yet--and a kindly gleam\r\ncame into his face for the moment--even though guilty, she might not be\r\nthoroughly and utterly corrupt. If he could, at least, believe that she\r\nhad been sorely tempted--if he could only, for the sake of past\r\nmemories, learn to pity her, rather than to hate! And this became now\r\nthe tenor of his thoughts. In his deep reflection of a few hours before,\r\nhe had tried to believe that she was innocent. Now, circumstances of\r\nsuspicion had so overwhelmed her, that he could not think her innocent;\r\nbut he could have wished to believe her less guilty, and thereby have\r\ncherished a kindly feeling toward her.\r\n\r\nRising up, and now for the first time seeing Leta, as she still stood\r\nunder the archway and watched him, he tottered toward her; and, incited\r\nby this new impulse of generous feeling, he pleaded to her--humbling his\r\npride, indeed, but in all else, whether in word or action, clothing\r\nhimself with the graceful dignity of true and earnest manliness.\r\n\r\n'Tell me,' he said, 'whether you know aught about her which can calm my\r\nsoul and give me the right to think better of her. You cannot make me\r\nbelieve that she is innocent--I do not ask it of you. That hope is past\r\nforever. But it may be that you can reveal more than you have yet\r\nmentioned to me. You have watched her, I know. Perhaps, therefore, you\r\ncan tell me that she struggled long with herself before she abandoned\r\nme. Even that assurance will help me to think more pityingly of her.\r\nRemember that there was a time when I loved her; and, for the sake of\r\nthat time, help me to feel and act generously toward her.'\r\n\r\nAs Leta gazed upon him, and saw how his late imperiousness had given\r\nplace to earnest, sorrowful entreaty, she hesitated for the moment how\r\nto answer him. There is, perhaps, a latent sympathy in the hardest\r\nheart; and despite her resolve to become at once lost and unpitying,\r\nsome sparks of tender feeling, kindled into life by her parting with\r\nCleotos, yet glimmered in her breast. Cleotos having gone away, she felt\r\nstrangely lonesome. Little as she had regarded him when present, it now\r\nseemed as though, in separating from him, she had lost a portion of her\r\nown being. Certainly with him had departed the last link that bound her\r\nto her native land; and though she never expected to return thither, yet\r\nit was not pleasant to feel that she had been cut asunder from all\r\npossibility of it. Now, for the moment, she was in the mood to look\r\naround her for a friend to lean upon; and it might be that she could\r\nfind that friend in Sergius, if she would consent to let her vengeance\r\nsleep, and would forbear to pursue him with further machinations. His\r\nlove, to be sure, was gone from her, never to be restored; but, after\r\nall, might it not be better to retain his friendship than to incur his\r\nhate? And if she were now to make full disclosure of the past, and ask\r\nhis pardon, who could estimate the possible limits of the forgiveness\r\nand generosity which, in his newly found happiness, he might extend to\r\nher? And then, now that her plans had failed, what need of inflicting\r\nfurther misery upon those who, in their former trust, had lavished\r\nkindnesses upon her? And once more her thoughts reverted to Cleotos; and\r\nwith that feeling of utter loneliness sinking into her heart, and making\r\nher crave even to be thought well of by another, she reflected how that\r\nfriend of her youth would not fail to ask the blessing of the gods upon\r\nher, if ever, in his native home, he were to hear that she had acted a\r\ngenerous part, and, by a few simple and easily spoken words, had swept\r\naway the web of mischief which her arts had woven.\r\n\r\n'What can I say?' she exclaimed, hesitatingly, as she met the pleading\r\nlook which Sergius fastened upon her.\r\n\r\n'Say the best you can; so that, though I can never forgive her, I may\r\nnot think more harshly of her than I ought. Can I forget that I loved\r\nher for years before I ever met yourself; and that, but for you, I might\r\nbe loving her still? Can I forget that it was not for my own glory, but\r\nfor hers, that I tore myself away from her and went to these late wars,\r\nhoping to win new honors, only that I might lay them at her feet? Night\r\nafter night, as I lay in my tent and gazed up at the sky, I thought of\r\nher alone, and how that the stars shone with equal light upon us both;\r\nand I nerved my soul with new strength, to finish my task with\r\ndiligence, so that I might the more quickly return to her side. And\r\nthen, Leta, then it was that I met yourself; and how sadly and basely I\r\nyielded to the fascinations you threw about me, you too well know. It\r\nwas not love I felt for you; think it not. My passion for you was no\r\nmore like the calm affection with which I had cherished her, than is the\r\nflame which devours the village like the moonlight which so softly falls\r\nupon and silvers yonder fountain. But, for all that, it has brought\r\ndestruction upon me. And now--'\r\n\r\n'And now, Sergius?'\r\n\r\n'Now I am undone by reason of it. From the first moment your ensnaring\r\nglance met mine, I was undone, though I then knew it not. Then was my\r\npure love for her obscured. Then, impelled by I know not what infernal\r\nspirit, began my downward course of deceit, until at last I almost\r\nlearned to hate her whom I had so much loved, and met her, at the end,\r\nwith but a simulated affection; caring but little for her, indeed, but\r\nnot--the gods be thanked!--so far gone in my selfish cruelty as to be\r\nable to wound her heart by open neglect in that hour of her joy.\r\nWhatever I may have done since then, that day, at least, her happiness\r\nwas undimmed. How gladly would I now give up all the honors I have\r\ngained, if I could but restore the peace and quiet of the past!\r\nRemembering all this, Leta, and how much of this cruel wrong is due to\r\nyou, can you not have pity? I know that she would never have been\r\nexposed to this temptation but for my own neglect of her, and but for\r\nthe fact that you had ambitious purposes of your own to work out. Nay, I\r\nchide you not. Let all that pass and be forgotten. I will be generous,\r\nand never mention it again, if you will only tell me how far your arts,\r\nrather than her own will, have led her astray. It cannot harm you now to\r\nfreely utter everything. The time for me to resent it is past. I have no\r\nfurther power over you, or the will to exercise it if I had.'\r\n\r\nA moment before, and she had been on the point of yielding to the\r\nunaccustomed pity that she began to feel, and so make full disclosure.\r\nBut now, as, almost unconsciously to himself, Sergius spoke of her\r\nbaffled hopes and vaguely hinted at her altered position toward\r\nhimself--a change of which he believed her to be yet ignorant--her fount\r\nof mercy became instantly scaled up, and her nearly melted heart again\r\nturned to flint. Yes, she had almost forgotten her new destiny. But now\r\nat once appeared before her, with all the vividness of reality, the\r\nbanquet hall, ringing with the shrill laughter of the heated revellers,\r\nas, with the dice box, they decided her future fate. Like a flash the\r\nsoftened smile fled from her face, leaving only cold, vindictive\r\ndefiance pictured there. And as Sergius, who had been led on from\r\nutterance to utterance by the increasing signs of compassion he read in\r\nher, saw the sudden and unaccountable change, he paused, in mingled\r\nwonderment and dismay; and, with the conviction that his hopes had\r\nfailed him, he put off, in turn, his own softened mien, and glaring back\r\ndefiance upon her, prepared for desperate struggle.\r\n\r\n'You speak of my new ownership--of the actor Bassus?' she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n'You know it, then?' cried he. 'You have played the spy upon us?'\r\n\r\n'Know it?' she repeated. 'When, in your wild revelling, your raised\r\nvoices told me how heedlessly you were bringing ruin upon yourself with\r\nthe dice, would I have been anything but a fool not to have remembered\r\nthat I, too, being your property, might pass away with the rest? Was it\r\nnot fit, then, that I should have stolen to the screen and listened? You\r\nthought to keep it secret, perhaps, until Bassus should send to take me\r\naway from here; for you imagined that I might attempt escape. But you do\r\nnot know me yet. Am I a child, to kick and scream, and waste my strength\r\nin unavailing strife against a fate that, in my heart, I feel must\r\nsooner or later be submitted to? Not long ago--it matters not how or\r\nwhen--I could have avoided it all, but would not. Now that I have\r\nsacrificed that chance, I will go to my doom with a smile upon my lips,\r\nwhatever heaviness may be in my heart; for, having chosen my path, I\r\nwill not shrink from following it. Thus much for myself. And as for you,\r\nwho have tossed me one side to the first poor brute who has begged for\r\nme, and even at this instant have taunted me with the story of baffled\r\nhopes, does it seem becoming in you to appeal longer to me, as you have\r\ndone, for comfort?'\r\n\r\nNo answer; but in the angry, heated glare with which he faced her,\r\ncould be seen the new fury which was rising within him--all the more\r\nviolent, perhaps, from the late calm that had possessed him.\r\n\r\n'And yet, for the sake of the past, I might even be willing to comfort\r\nyou, if it were possible,' she continued, casting about in her mind for\r\nnew tortures with which to rack him, and now suddenly struck with an\r\ninward joy, as her ever-ready invention came to her aid. 'Yes, if I knew\r\naught of good to tell, I would mention it, for the memory of other days.\r\nBut how can I speak with truth, unless to recapitulate new deceits and\r\nwiles which she has practised upon you, and of which, may the gods be my\r\nwitness! I would have told you before, but dared not? You say that you\r\nhave never loved me, Sergius Vanno. It is well. But if you had done so,\r\nI would have been faithful to you to the end. You say that you loved\r\nher, and that, but for your own falsehood, she would not have strayed\r\nfrom you. Poor dupe! to believe that, for all that meek, pale face of\r\nhers, she cannot resolve, and act, and mask her purposes as cunningly as\r\nany of the rest of her sex! Shall I tell you more? Do you dream that,\r\nwhile you have been revelling, she has been idly whimpering in her\r\nchamber? Had you watched outside with me, you might have known better.\r\nLook above your head, Sergius, to where the prison keys are wont to\r\nhang, and tell me where they are now!'\r\n\r\nMore from mechanical instinct than from any actual purpose of mind--for\r\nhe did not, at the first instant, fully comprehend her meaning--Sergius\r\nfollowed the motion of her hand, and gazed at the wall above his head;\r\nthen passed his fingers along until he touched the empty nail--then\r\nlooked back inquiringly at her.\r\n\r\n'The keys are gone, are they not?' she said. 'Fool! to lock up one party\r\nto a fault, and yet let the other one go free! Do you suppose that\r\nduring your carousing with your boon companions, she would fail to\r\nsuccor him for whose sake she has already lost so much?'\r\n\r\nStill he gazed at Leta with a look of puzzled inquiry, which now began,\r\nhowever, to be disturbed by an expression of painful doubt. Then\r\nsuddenly, ascertaining that the keys were really gone, her meaning\r\nflashed upon him; and dropping his hand with a wrathful exclamation, he\r\nturned and strode into the palace. Not, perhaps, with full conviction of\r\nthe truth of the suggestion so artfully arrayed before him. But he would\r\nat least prove its truth or falsity; and, with that suspicion fastened\r\nupon his bewildered and unreasoning mind, to doubt was almost to\r\nbelieve, and crossing the ante-chamber to Ænone's room, he burst in upon\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe had fallen into a troubled sleep--lying dressed upon the outside of\r\nher couch, as, in her agony of mind, she had first thrown herself down.\r\nThe unspent tears still trembled upon her eyelids. Beside her lay the\r\nlittle folded parchment which Cleotos had given her. She had taken it\r\nout to read, hoping, but scarcely believing, that she would now be able\r\nto experience the truth of what she had been told about the earnest\r\nwords there written being divinely adapted to give peace to a troubled\r\nheart. But her sorrow was too deep to be healed by phrases whose spirit\r\ncould, of necessity, be so imperfectly comprehended by her; and the\r\nwriting had slipped unheeded from her light grasp.\r\n\r\nAs her husband now entered, she awoke and sat upright, in frightened\r\nattitude, not knowing what fate was about to befall her.\r\n\r\n'Where is he? What have you done with him?' Sergius cried, seizing her\r\nby the arm.\r\n\r\nShe did not answer, not knowing, of course, wherefore the question was\r\nput to her, or what it concerned. Yet, perceiving that she was again\r\nsuspected of some act of which she was innocent, she would have asked\r\nfor mercy and pardon, if time had been given her. But even that was\r\ndenied her. Hardly, indeed, could she draw a breath, when she felt that\r\na new thread was woven in the web of misconception which surrounded her.\r\nFor, at that moment, her husband's eye fell upon the forgotten\r\nparchment; and picking it up, he opened it, gave one hasty look, and\r\nthen tossed it aside. What need, now, of further proof? Was not that the\r\nslave's writing, recognizable at a glance? Words of love, of course! And\r\nshe had gone to sleep fondly holding them in her hand, as a treasure\r\nfrom which she could not be parted for an instant. Words not freshly\r\nwritten, either, for the parchment was yellow and discolored. So much\r\nthe worse, therefore; for did it not prove a course of long-continued\r\ndeception? Could there be any doubt now? Yes, a long deceit. And this\r\nwas she for whom, in his simplicity, he had but a moment before been\r\nframing excuses, in the effort to convince himself that her fault had\r\nbeen one of impulse, rather than of cool deliberation! This was she in\r\nwhose behalf he had weakly lowered himself to plead to his own cast-off\r\nslave for extenuating evidences! And once more grasping her by the arm,\r\nhe lifted her from the couch, and, followed by Leta, hurried her across\r\nthe room into the outer hall, into the court yard, past the fountain,\r\nand so onward until they stood before the prison house. There, seeing\r\nthe inner door open, the outer door swinging loosely inward, with the\r\nkey yet remaining in its lock, and the captive fled, Sergius deemed her\r\nnew crime fully proved, and again turned madly upon her.\r\n\r\n'Where is he? What have you done with him? Am I to be thus balked of my\r\nvengeance? Is it to be endured that, while I entertain my friends, you\r\nshould steal off so treacherously, and thus complete the dishonor you\r\nhave brought upon me?'\r\n\r\n'I have not--done dishonor--to my lord!' she gasped with difficulty, for\r\nshe was almost speechless from the rapidity with which he had hurried\r\nher along, and his close grasp upon her arm pained her. 'Let me but\r\nspeak--I will explain--I know not how--'\r\n\r\n'No falsehoods--no pleadings to me!' he cried. 'It will avail you\r\nnothing now. What more proof do I need? Is not the whole story written\r\nout plainly before my eyes? Have you not stolen away to release him,\r\npreferring his safety and favor to my honor or your own? If not, where\r\nis he? Escaped me, by the gods! Escaped me, after all! Fool that I have\r\nbeen, to leave that key within your meddling reach!'\r\n\r\nOverborne by his violence, not of words merely, but of gesture, Ænone\r\nhad, little by little, shrunk from before him as he spoke, until she had\r\nunconsciously passed through the open doorway, and into the narrow\r\nstreet beyond. Leta and he still remained within the building, standing\r\nbeside the swinging door. There was even now but a single pace between\r\nÆnone and himself, and it was scarcely likely that such a trifling\r\ndistance could reassure her. It was more probably something in his tone\r\nor action which now gave her courage to meet his imputation. Whatever\r\nthe nature of the inspiration, she now suddenly drew herself up, as\r\nthough indued with new strength, and answered him with something of the\r\nsame recklessness of spirit with which once before during that day she\r\nhad cast aside all fear of misconstruction, and, with the sustaining\r\nconsciousness of innocence and justice, had defied him.\r\n\r\n'Escaped you?' she cried; 'I thank the gods for it! I did not set him\r\nfree, but I would have done so, had I known how. He was my friend--my\r\nbrother. Would I have left him, do you think, to suffer torture and\r\ndeath for simple kindnesses to me, when, with one turn of a key,\r\nI--could have released him? Would I let the memory of other days so\r\ncompletely pass from my mind as to--'\r\n\r\nHow, at that instant, happened the door to close? Was it owing to the\r\nwind, or to a skilful and concealed touch of Leta's hand, or to some\r\nunconscious pressure of Sergius against it? The cause matters little. It\r\nwas enough that, of a sudden, the loosely hanging door swung round on\r\nits creaking hinges into its place, fastening itself securely with a\r\nspring bolt as its edge touched the lintel, and leaving Ænone shut out\r\nalone in the dark street upon the other side.\r\n\r\nUpon the instant, Sergius sprang forward to reopen the door. Convinced\r\nof her perfidy, and madly lashing himself into yet further fury with the\r\nconsciousness of his wrongs, it was as yet not in his mind that even by\r\naccident such a forced separation as this should befall her. His hand\r\nwas upon the bolt--in another second it would have been drawn back--when\r\nhis further action was arrested by a few lowly uttered words of Leta.\r\n\r\nNot spoken to him, for, in his present state of mind, he was more than\r\never morbidly jealous of any interference or attempted control, and\r\nwould most surely have disregarded them. But spoken as though to\r\nherself, in a kind of whispered soliloquy, softly muttered, but yet with\r\nutterance sufficiently distinct to reach his watchful ear.\r\n\r\n'Ah, she will not regard that,' were the words, 'for of course she will\r\nknow where to rejoin him.'\r\n\r\nSergius started as the new idea impressed itself upon him. Could this be\r\ntrue, indeed? Why not? Was it likely that the wife would have released\r\nthe slave whom she loved, and not have told him where they could meet\r\nagain? That, surely, would be too foolish an oversight, for it would be\r\nthrowing away all the benefits attending the escape. It were hardly\r\npossible that any trust could have been reposed in the prospect of\r\nfuture chance interviews, for that would be but a slender hope to lean\r\nupon. In that boiling, seething world of Rome, now more than ever\r\ndisturbed by the inroads of strangers eagerly looking forward to the\r\nexcitements of the amphitheatre, it would be in vain to make even\r\ndeliberate and careful search for a lost slave, unless some clew should\r\nbe left behind. Yes, she must surely have that clew; and doubtless she\r\npurposed to use it as soon as daylight came. Let her go now, therefore.\r\nIt were idle to call her back only for new flight in a few hours hence.\r\n\r\nStill with his hand resting upon the bolt as these reflections passed\r\nthrough his mind, Sergius glanced keenly at Leta, as though possessed\r\nwith some dim suspicion that she had meant her words to be overheard.\r\nThen, feeling reassured by her composed attitude, he turned away,\r\nmuttered something to himself the import of which she could not catch,\r\ndropped his hand from the undrawn bolt to his side, stood for a moment\r\nin a kind of maze of confusion, and finally left the prison, and\r\nstaggered through the garden to the house.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nStunned and confused by her sudden exclusion, and naturally believing\r\nthat it was the result of deliberate action upon her husband's part,\r\nÆnone now felt all her sudden inspiration of courage deserting her, and\r\nsank half fainting against the outside wall. For a moment it seemed to\r\nher like a dream. She could realize suspicion, harsh language, and even\r\ncruel treatment within a certain limit, for these were all within the\r\nscope of her late experience; but it was hard to comprehend this\r\nunlooked-for and apparently deliberate excess of degradation. But\r\ngradually the mist cleared away from her bewildered mind, and she\r\nrecognized the reality of what had befallen her. Still, however, her\r\nthoughts could not at once grapple with the overwhelming sense of the\r\nindignity and suffering cast upon her. She could not doubt that she had\r\nbeen expelled from her lord's house--cast out unprotected and friendless\r\nin the midst of night, with undeserved reproaches. But, for all that, a\r\ndelusive hope clung to her. He could not mean that this should last. It\r\nwas but an impulse of sudden anger. He would repent of it in a moment,\r\nand would call upon her to return to him. He would shed tears of bitter\r\nshame, perhaps, and would beg that she would forgive him. And she would\r\nbe foolish enough to do so, she felt, at the very first pleading word\r\nfrom him; though at the same time feeling that her own self-respect\r\nshould prompt her to show more lasting resentment. If thus easily forgot\r\nthe past, what security could she feel that, in some future transport of\r\nrage, he might not repeat the act? But for all that, she felt that she\r\nwould weakly too soon forgive him.\r\n\r\nSliding her trembling hand down the damp wall, she found along its foot\r\na ledge of stone more or less projecting in different sections, in\r\naccordance with the architectural requirements of the building. Seating\r\nherself upon the widest portion of this ledge, she now waited to hear\r\nthe key again turned in the lock and the door swung open upon its\r\ncreaking hinges, and to see loving arms extended with repentant words of\r\nself-reproach. Once or twice she fancied that she heard the key softly\r\nfitted into its place, but it was only the abrasion of two contiguous\r\nbranches of a plane tree overhead. Once again she felt certain that she\r\nheard the sound of persons approaching through the garden, but it was\r\nthe voice of men in the street--two slaves coming around the corner and\r\ndrawing near, speaking some harsh northern dialect which she knew not.\r\nAs the men approached, she endeavored to shrink out of sight behind a\r\nperpendicular projection of the wall, and nearly succeeded. They had\r\npassed, indeed, before they noticed her. Then they turned and gazed\r\ncuriously at her; and one of them made some remark, apparently of a\r\njesting nature, for they both laughed. Then again they turned and moved\r\non out of sight without attempting further molestation.\r\n\r\nBut the incident alarmed her, and caused her to realize yet more vividly\r\nthan before the exceeding unprotectedness of her situation. These men\r\nhad not sought to injure her, but how could she answer for the next who\r\nmight approach? It was a lonely, dark street, narrow, and comparatively\r\nseldom used, and but little built upon, being mainly flanked by garden\r\nwalls. Upon the side where she sat there were no buildings at all,\r\nexcepting low prison houses for slaves, similar to that belonging to the\r\nVanno palace--for the street ran along an inner slope of the Coelian\r\nMount and parallel to the Triumphal Way, and thus naturally served as a\r\nrear boundary to the gardens of the palaces and villas which fronted\r\nupon the latter avenue. This very loneliness, therefore, added to her\r\ninsecurity; for though it was possible that no one else might pass by\r\nfor hours, there was the equal chance that if any one came with evil\r\nintent, she might be murdered before help could be summoned. And at a\r\ntime when the broadest streets were never entirely safe even for armed\r\nmen, a weak woman, with tempting jewelry upon her person, might well\r\nshudder at being left alone in a narrow alley.\r\n\r\nSlowly and painfully--for the night was cool, and she had now been\r\nsitting long in one position--Ænone raised herself and stood up, looking\r\nhither and thither for some place of refuge. She had now waited more\r\nthan an hour, and if her husband had been inclined to recall her from\r\nher exclusion, his repentance would scarcely have tarried so long. His\r\nanger was generally fierce, but of short duration; could it be that in\r\nthis case his sense of injury was so great as to make him more\r\nunreasoning than usual? Her heart sank yet lower with a new weight of\r\ndespair; but again hope whispered alleviation. He had been drinking\r\ndeeply--she said to herself--and had not clearly comprehended what he\r\nhad done. And afterward he had probably forgotten all about it, and had\r\nfallen off into sleep. Upon the morrow he would be himself again.\r\nPerhaps he would not then remember the outrage he had committed against\r\nher. Certainly his anger would not still burn when corrected by\r\nreturning reason. She must therefore endeavor to gain access again to\r\nthe palace, and there avoid his presence, until the morrow brought to\r\nhim fresher reflection and a better inclination to listen to\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nAnd accordingly she commenced her departure from her hiding place, and\r\nslowly crept along the blank flanking wall of the little street, hoping\r\nsoon to gain the palace front. At first it seemed a very easy thing to\r\ndo so. Though she had never before been in that portion of the city, she\r\nknew enough of its geography to feel certain that if she followed the\r\nstreet in either direction, she could not fail to come to some\r\nintersecting alley, through which she could reach the Triumphal Way.\r\nOnce there, the route was familiar to her, and she could arrive at her\r\nhome in a few minutes. But as she advanced, she found that what had\r\nappeared to be an easy stroll, seemed converted into a toilsome and\r\nperplexing journey. Confused and terrified, the coolness necessary to\r\npursue in safety even so short a route began to fail her. At times she\r\nimagined that she heard strangers approaching, and then it became\r\nneedful to conceal herself again, as well as she could, behind\r\nprojections or in recesses of the wall. Then, when once more venturing\r\nout, the shadows of the wall itself or of neighboring buildings would\r\nterrify her into seeking other concealments. And once, after having\r\nresumed her course, she discovered that she had mistaken the direction,\r\nand was retracing her steps.\r\n\r\nAt last, after a journey of nearly an hour, during which she had only\r\nadvanced as far as a resolute person might have gone in a few minutes,\r\nshe reached an intersecting street leading to the Triumphal Way. It was\r\na wider passage than that which she was leaving, and this fact added to\r\nher dismay. For though she had at first feared the narrower street for\r\nits loneliness, yet now that she had so far glided through it in safety,\r\nshe had begun to feel somewhat reassured, and in turn dreaded the more\r\nopen channels, since they would naturally be more frequented. It was,\r\ntherefore, with new trepidation that, upon turning the corner, she saw,\r\nin the broader street before her, signs of movement and life. The street\r\nhappened to be a favorite thoroughfare from the Triumphal Way, across\r\nthe Coelian Mount, and, in consequence, was never, perhaps, entirely\r\ndeserted. Now that the whole city was throbbing with anticipations of\r\nthe morrow's festivities, there were more persons wakeful and wandering\r\nabout with feverish expectation than usual. Moreover, it was a street\r\nwhich abounded with drinking shops, and these were now all open, in\r\nspite of the lateness of the hour, and appeared to be thronged with\r\ncustomers. One of these shops stood upon the corner where Ænone had\r\nhalted. A faint light burned over the doorway to mark the locality; and\r\nthrough the open passage she could see a crowd of ill-conditioned,\r\nrough-looking men, appearing, in the dim light, more rough and uncouth\r\nthan they really were. Here were mingled together artisans of the lower\r\norders, slaves and professional gladiators, all drinking and singing\r\ntogether in close fraternity. For a moment Ænone paused and hesitated,\r\nnot daring to pass on. If she could reach the farther side without\r\nattracting observation, it would be but one step gained, for there were\r\nmany other drinking shops glimmering in the distance along the whole\r\nstreet, and each one had its special crowd of noisy customers. To escape\r\none peril seemed only to run into another. Then, as she deliberated and\r\nalternately put her foot forward and withdrew it again in a fruitless\r\nattempt to muster courage to run the gauntlet, two men emerged from the\r\nwine shop, and staggered toward her--a slave and a gladiator, linked arm\r\nin arm, and singing a wild song in discordant keys. Both appeared to be\r\nunder the influence of wine, though in different degrees; for while the\r\nformer had set no bounds to his license, the latter had somewhat\r\nrestrained his propensities, in view of the demands upon his strength\r\nwhich the morrow's work would surely make. Seeing these men reel toward\r\nher, Ænone turned and fled, without knowing, or, for the moment, caring,\r\nin which direction she went. The men had not at first seen her, but, as\r\nthey now caught sight of her flying figure, they set up a drunken whoop,\r\nand attempted to follow. All in vain; for ere they had advanced many\r\npaces, their weakened limbs betrayed them, and they sank powerless upon\r\nthe ground, and, forgetting the pursuit, rolled over lovingly in each\r\nother's arms. Meanwhile, Ænone, not daring to look back, and not knowing\r\nthat the chase had ended, still fled in wild terror, until at last her\r\nbreath failed her, and she tottered helpless into the shade of the\r\nnearest wall.\r\n\r\nShe was now lost indeed. How long she had been running, or in which\r\ndirection, how many divergences she had taken, or how many narrow alleys\r\nthreaded, she knew not. She simply realized that she was in a portion of\r\nthe city where she had never been before, and from which extrication\r\nseemed impossible, so dark and narrow and winding seemed the passages in\r\nevery direction. Far narrower and darker, indeed, than the lane behind\r\nthe palace, and without its protecting solitude. In place of high garden\r\nwalls, the whole route seemed lined with miserable tenements, the refuge\r\nof the lowest of the Roman population. There, crowded together in close\r\ncommunication, were the rabble of poorer slaves and beggars, all equally\r\nmarked with rags and filth.\r\n\r\nIn all this there was one comfort. However thronged the tenements along\r\nthe side might be, the street itself seemed deserted, nor could Ænone\r\nany longer hear the sound of pursuit. That, at least, she had escaped,\r\nand now again she took partial courage as she reflected that with\r\nmoderate caution she might yet be able to extricate herself. There must\r\nbe some outlet to that neighborhood of squalid misery; and take\r\nwhichever way she might, she could scarcely fail, at the end, to emerge\r\ninto some more reputable region.\r\n\r\nAgain the sound of two persons approaching restrained her, and caused\r\nher to shrink into a corner until they might pass. Unlike the others,\r\nthese men had not been drinking, but advanced gravely and steadily, with\r\na slow, deliberate pace, indicative of weighty reflection. These, also,\r\nwere slaves; and before they emerged into sight from the surrounding\r\ndarkness, Ænone could distinctly mark the low, plotting whisper with\r\nwhich they spoke, occasionally rising, from excess of emotion, into a\r\nlouder key. As they came opposite to her, they paused--not seeing her,\r\nbut simply seeming to be arrested by the vehemence of their debate; and\r\nagain their words sank nearly into a whisper.\r\n\r\n'Tell me why I should not do so?' hissed the nearest, a man of gigantic\r\nproportions and development of strength. 'Why should I not leap out of\r\nthe arena where these men place me to play a fool's part; and scrambling\r\nover the ranges of seats, plunge this dagger into his heart? Ye gods!\r\nwere I once to begin to clamber up, no force could stop me from reaching\r\nhim, were he at the very topmost range! And I will--why not?'\r\n\r\n'You would gain but an instant's revenge,' said the other, striving to\r\nsoothe him, 'and you would lose--'\r\n\r\n'What? My life, would you say?' retorted the first. 'I know it. I know\r\nwell, that before I could strike him thrice, I would myself be beaten\r\ndown, a corpse. But one blow from me would be sufficient for him. Ay,\r\nthough I used not my knife at all, but only my hardened fist. Would it\r\nnot be a fine revenge, say you, thus to kill him? It was on account of\r\nmy strength of arm that he laid toils for my capture, and for that alone\r\nhe most valued me. Why not, then, prove its quality upon himself? With a\r\nsingle blow I could crush in his proud head like an egg shell. Then let\r\nthem kill me--I care not.'\r\n\r\n'And yet the life once lost by you cannot be gained again,' responded\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n'O feeble-minded!' said the first, with disdain. 'Have I ever so dearly\r\ncared for life that I should thus guard it at the expense of honor?\r\nWhile I was a free man, in my native Rhodes, with my wife and children\r\naround me, did I not then risk my life among the very first? And am I\r\nlikely to value it the more now that I am a slave, with wife torn from\r\nme and sent I know not where, with children slain one by one, as the\r\nonly means of capturing me, with the accursed livery of the arena placed\r\nupon me that I may administer to their gaping appetite for blood? Can\r\nall this make me love my life more than I have ever loved it before?'\r\n\r\n'But wait--only wait. There will come a time--'\r\n\r\n'Ay, ay; there will come a time is what all say, and will continue to\r\nsay, and yet the time comes not. There is never any time like the\r\npresent. All around me are thousands of men, once free and now chained\r\ninto slavery--and chained, perhaps, more through their own indolence\r\nthan by the power of their masters; and yet they lie supine, and call\r\nupon each other to wait! And to-morrow there will be a thousand such in\r\nthe arena, and instead of rising up together in their strength, they\r\nwill fight only with each other. What might not that thousand\r\naccomplish, were they to act together in brave and earnest revolt? What\r\nchance would a few hundred pampered pretorians have of staying the\r\nflood? There, seated in fancied security upon their benches, will be the\r\nemperor, the court, the nobles, and the most wealthy of the empire. In\r\none hour of action, we could sweep these away like chaff, together with\r\nall else that is held most worthy of place and power in the whole\r\nempire! And yet these thousand slaves will not rise up together with me,\r\nand it will not be done!'\r\n\r\nThe head of the Hercules dropped upon his chest with a gesture of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n'You say truly,' responded the other. 'It will not be done, for they\r\nwill not act with you. And what can you do alone?'\r\n\r\n'Nothing--nothing; I see it all. I am powerless,' murmured the first.\r\n'Well, I will be patient, and dissimulate. I will do as you request,\r\nGorgo. I will restrain myself. As for this man--this imperator--why\r\nshould I there wreak my vengeance upon him? It would only be giving to\r\nthe rest of the people an unlooked-for sight--a newer pleasure, that is\r\nall. I will therefore act the part of a good and faithful slave--will\r\nkiss the rod held over me--and will duly serve my master by slaying my\r\nadversary, whoever he may be, and thus winning that store of gold pieces\r\nwhich have been laid out as the stake of my life. And then--then I will\r\ngo home to my kennel and my bones. But this I swear, by the immortal\r\ngods! that I will follow this man from house to forum, wherever he may\r\ngo, until I find a proper chance to strike him down in secret like a\r\ndog. You were right. I must not lose my life to kill him, when I can so\r\neasily slay him and yet live to slay other men as bad as he. My life is\r\nfor other things. And when the time comes that I can raise the standard\r\nof insurrection, will you then--'\r\n\r\n'Then I will be with you heart and soul forever, until our freedom is\r\nbuilt up on the ruins of this accursed Rome!' cried the other, striking\r\nhis hand responsively into the outstretched palm before him. And the two\r\nmen again took up their walk, and passed on until they were swallowed up\r\nin the darkness and their voices, growing more and more indistinct, were\r\nfinally hushed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE VISION.\r\n\r\nINSCRIBED TO TEACHERS TO CONTRABANDS IN THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Lo! a picture came before me\r\n    Of a million broken chains,\r\n  Lying cankered with old blood-drops\r\n    Which had oozed from tortured veins,\r\n  Reddening the fleecy cotton\r\n    Snowed upon the Southern plains.\r\n\r\n  And the picture's tints grew deeper,\r\n    Redder, blacker, as I gazed,\r\n  And my weak knees smote together,\r\n    And my eyes grew dim and glazed,\r\n  At the vision's spectred horrors\r\n    From the graves of vengeance raised.\r\n\r\n  For, where liveoaks and magnolias\r\n    Gloom the earth with densest shades,\r\n  Where the snake and alligator\r\n    Lurk in endless everglades,\r\n  Where the cloud-lace-fretted sunset\r\n    Lingering, longest night evades,\r\n\r\n  Where the eagle builds his eyrie\r\n    Nearest to the fervid skies,\r\n  Where the buzzard swoops to fatten\r\n    On the prey that lingering dies,\r\n  Where the bloodhound's hellish baying\r\n    Stills the hunted bondman's cries,\r\n\r\n  There uprose, all ghostly shadowed,\r\n    Hosts of wasted, haggard forms;\r\n  And their wild eyes glared and glittered\r\n    Like heaven's fire in dark-browed storms,\r\n  And with outstretched arms toward me\r\n    They came rushing in thick swarms.\r\n\r\n  And I saw upon their foreheads\r\n    Letters where the irons burned,\r\n  And their backs left gashed and harrowed\r\n    Where the lash for life-blood yearned,\r\n  And their lank limbs, fester-eaten,\r\n    Showed where gnawing shackles turned.\r\n\r\n  There were gaunt and frenzied mothers\r\n    With wan children in their arms,\r\n  There were youths, and there were maidens,\r\n    Curses, tears, and wild alarms,\r\n  There were auction blocks and hammers\r\n    Where were bartered beauty's charms.\r\n\r\n  Ah! my heart grew chill within me,\r\n    And my 'frighted blood congealed,\r\n  As my soul's eye raised the shadows\r\n    Which like curtains half concealed\r\n  Deeper horrors, depths of anguish\r\n    Left till God's day unrevealed!\r\n\r\n  And my soul went up in sighing\r\n    To God's ear: 'And _Thou_ dost know,\r\n  High and Holy! men are devils,\r\n    Earth, like hell, is drowned in woe?'\r\n  Came an answer: 'Hark! my war-blast\r\n    Dealing sin a staggering blow!'\r\n\r\n  'Father! though the chains be broken,'\r\n    Cried my soul, 'the wounds remain,\r\n  Deeper than the irons wore them,\r\n    'Neath the brow within the brain,\r\n  'Neath the body in the spirit!\r\n    Peals Thy war-blast not in vain?\r\n\r\n  'How shall knowledge, how shall virtue\r\n    Dwell with ignorance and sin?\r\n  Where is found that earthly saintship\r\n    Can consort with devils' din?\r\n  Who the saintly self-denying\r\n    Through bell's door would look within\r\n\r\n  'E'en to save the devil's victims,\r\n    Snatch them from the cooling flames,\r\n  Kiss with love their long-charred spirits,\r\n    Breathe new souls into their names,\r\n  Wing them to the climes supernal,\r\n    And to angels' loud acclaims?'\r\n\r\n  Then came answer: 'Lo! I call them,\r\n    Ministers of love, I call!'\r\n  Then I waited in the silence,\r\n    With God waited over all,\r\n  Till I knew how He forgetteth\r\n    No one worthy, great or small.\r\n\r\n  For I saw from where the ocean\r\n    Drifts its rhythms to the beach,\r\n  From where mountain snows eternal\r\n    Far toward heaven as stainless reach,\r\n  From where gold and russet harvests\r\n    Of God's 'whelming bounty teach,\r\n\r\n  From where all are always freemen,\r\n    From where colleges and schools\r\n  Free the mind from Old-World trammels,\r\n    Unfit men for tyrants' tools,\r\n  From where firesides and altars\r\n    Govern hearts with golden rules,\r\n\r\n  Came, as flowers come in spring-time\r\n    Dropt from Winter's icy hand,\r\n  Came to cheer, to teach, to brighten--\r\n    God's commissioned, shining band;\r\n  Came with hands and hearts o'erflowing\r\n    To renew the Southern land!\r\n\r\n  And I watched how spirit-anguish\r\n    Songs and smiles soon soothed, allayed,\r\n  And how soul-wounds touched by kindness,\r\n    As by Christ, could heal and fade,\r\n  And how darkness fled affrighted\r\n    Where these angels wept and prayed.\r\n\r\n  And my soul went up in praising\r\n    To God's ear: 'Yea, Thou dost know,\r\n  High and Holy! men are devils,\r\n    Earth, like hell, is drowned in woe;\r\n  But Thy war-blast, in Thy mercy,\r\n    Hath dealt sin a staggering blow!'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNDIVINE COMEDY--A POLISH DRAMA.\r\n\r\nDedicated to Mary.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\n'Bottomless perdition.'--_Milton._\r\n\r\nFog and cloud! Nothing can be seen from the bastions of the castle of\r\nthe Holy Trinity, to the right or to the left, in front or in the rear,\r\nbut dense, motionless, snowy mist; a spectral image of that deluge-wrath\r\nwhich, as it rose to sweep o'er earth, once broke against these stern,\r\nsteep cliffs and beetling peaks of rock: no trace is to be seen of the\r\nburied valley, for the ghostly waves of the cold, white sea of foam\r\nshroud it closely in their stifling veils; the glowing face of the\r\ncrimson sun shines not as yet upon earth's winding sheet of silent,\r\nclinging, pallid vapor.\r\n\r\nThe tower of the castle stands upon a bold and naked granite peak. Built\r\nof the strong rock from which it soars by the giant labor of the now\r\ndying Past, it seems during the lapse of centuries to have grown up from\r\nits stony heart, as the human breast grows from the broad back of the\r\nCentaur. A single banner streams above its lofty turret, the only banner\r\nof the Cross now raised on earth; the symbol of God's mystic love alone\r\nfloats high enough to pierce into the unclouded blue of the stormy sky!\r\n\r\nThe white and sleeping mist gradually awakens; the sighing and howling\r\nof the bleak winds are heard above; the vapor palpitates in the first\r\nrays of the coming sun, and a drifting ice-floe of curdling clouds\r\ndrives wildly o'er this quickening sea of fog and foam.\r\n\r\nOther voices, human voices, mingle with the wails and sobs of the\r\npassing storm: borne upward on the ghastly waves of the spectral cloud\r\nsea, they break against the walls of the granite castle.\r\n\r\nThe pallid shroud of mist is suddenly riven, and through the walls of\r\nthe chasm torn through the heart of the white foam, glimpses are seen of\r\nthe abyss below.\r\n\r\nHow dark it looks in the depths! A sea of heads in wild commotion surges\r\nthere; the valley swarms with human life as ocean's slimy sands with\r\ncreeping things that writhe and sting.\r\n\r\nThe sun! the sun! He mounts above the rocky peaks; the pallid vapors\r\nrise in blood and melt in gold, and as they roll and lift into the sky,\r\nmore and more distinctly grow upon the view the threatening swarms of\r\nmen still gathering below.\r\n\r\nThe quivering mist rolls into crimson clouds and scales the craggy\r\ncliffs; it dies softly away into the blue depths of the infinite sky.\r\nThe valley glitters like a sea of light, throws back the dewy sunshine\r\nin a dazzling glare, for every hand is armed with sharp and sparkling\r\nblades and points of steel--and millions are seen pouring into its\r\ndepths, numberless as they will pour into the vale of the Last Judgment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A cathedral church in the castle of the Holy Trinity.\r\n\r\n     Lords, senators, dignitaries are seen seated on either side, each\r\n     under the banner of a king or knight. Bands of nobles stand behind\r\n     the banners. The Archbishop is in front of the high altar, a choir\r\n     of stoled Priests kneel behind and around it. The Man appears,\r\n     pauses a few moments on the threshold of the church, then advances\r\n     slowly up the aisle to the Archbishop, holding a banner in his\r\n     hand.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF PRIESTS. O God of our fathers! we, Thy last priests, pray in\r\nthe last church of Thy Son now standing upon earth for the faith of our\r\nancestors! Deliver us from our enemies, O Lord our God!\r\n\r\nFIRST COUNT. See with what pride Count Henry regards us.\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNT. As if the whole universe were at his feet.\r\n\r\nTHIRD COUNT. And yet he has done nothing but cut his way through the\r\ncamp of the peasants at night!\r\n\r\nFIRST COUNT. He left one hundred, nay, it is reported, two hundred of\r\ntheir men dead upon the place of combat.\r\n\r\nSECOND COUNT. Let us object to his appointment as general-in-chief.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_kneeling at the feet of the Archbishop_). I lay my trophy at\r\nthy feet!\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOP (_giving him a sword_). Gird this sword upon thee; it was\r\nonce consecrated to Saint Florian!\r\n\r\nMANY VOICES. Long live Count Henry! Vivat! vivat!\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOP. And thus sealing thee with the sign of the cross, I commit\r\nto thy hands the sole command of this, our last fortress and refuge upon\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIt is the universal wish that thou shouldst assume the rank of\r\ngeneral-in-chief.\r\n\r\nMANY VOICES. Long live our general! Vivat! vivat!\r\n\r\nA VOICE. I will not give my consent to the appointment!\r\n\r\nMANY VOICES. Away with the objector! Long live Count Henry!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. If any one present have just cause to reproach me, let him\r\nproclaim it openly, and not hide himself in the crowd!\r\n\r\n     He pauses; no one responds.\r\n\r\nI accept this sword from thy hands, most reverend father; and may God\r\nsend me an early and sudden death if I fail to deliver thee!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF PRIESTS. Gift him with power, O God; and let Thy Holy Spirit\r\ndescend upon him! Deliver us from our enemies, O Lord!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Let us all, princes, knights, and nobles, take a solemn oath to\r\ndefend the glory and fame of our fathers!\r\n\r\nLet us swear that though hunger and thirst may lead us to death, they\r\nshall not force us to dishonor!\r\n\r\nLet us vow that no suffering shall induct us to capitulate, to yield one\r\nof our just rights, or to sacrifice any of the duties due to our\r\nCreator! Swear!\r\n\r\nMANY VOICES. We swear.\r\n\r\n     The Archbishop elevates the Cross, they kneel and pledge their\r\n     faith.\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF PRIESTS. The perjured Thou wilt punish in Thy wrath, O God!\r\n\r\nThe faint-hearted Thou wilt punish in Thy wrath, O God!\r\n\r\nThe traitor Thou wilt punish in Thy wrath O God!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_drawing his sword_). Keep the oath, and I promise glory--for\r\nvictory, pray to God!\r\n\r\n     He leaves the church, surrounded and followed by bands of knights,\r\n     nobles, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A courtyard in the castle of the Holy Trinity. The Man, counts,\r\n     barons, princes, noblemen.\r\n\r\nA COUNT (_leading the Man aside_). What--is all irretrievably lost?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Not all, unless your courage fail before the time.\r\n\r\nTHE COUNT. Before what time?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Before death!\r\n\r\nA BARON (_leading him off on the other side_). It is reported that you\r\nhave seen and spoken with our dreadful foe, Count Henry. If we should\r\nfall into his hands, will he have the least compassion upon us?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. To tell you the truth, such compassion as our fathers never\r\ndreamed could be shown to them: '_the gallows_!'\r\n\r\nTHE BARON. We must guard against that to the utmost of our power!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. What says your excellency?\r\n\r\nPRINCE. I must speak a few words alone with you, (_He draws Count Henry\r\naside_.) It is all very well to encourage our people, but you must\r\nsurely be aware that we can hold out no longer.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. What else is left us, prince?\r\n\r\nPRINCE. As you have been appointed chief, it is for you to propose the\r\nterms of _capitulation_.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Not so loud....\r\n\r\nPRINCE. Why not?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Because your excellency would thus forfeit your own life! (_He\r\nturns to the men thronging around him._) He who speaks of surrender will\r\nbe punished with death!\r\n\r\nBARON, COUNT, AND PRINCE (_together_.) He who speaks of surrender will\r\nbe punished with death!\r\n\r\nALL. With death! With death! Vivat! vivat!\r\n\r\n  EXEUNT.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The gallery of the tower. The Man. Jacob.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Where is my son, Jacob?\r\n\r\nJACOB. He is in the north tower, seated on the threshold of the old\r\nvault and dungeon, singing strange songs of prophecy.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Man the Leonoren bastion as strongly as possible, stir not from\r\nthe spot, and make constant use of the best glass to observe what\r\nmovements are going on among the forces of the besiegers.\r\n\r\nJACOB. So help me God the Lord!\r\n\r\nIt were well to give a glass of brandy to our troops to keep up their\r\nsinking courage.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. If necessary, open the cellars of our counts and princes.\r\n\r\n  Exit Jacob.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_mounting some feet higher, and standing wider the banner upon\r\na small terrace_). With the whole power of my eyes I trace your plans;\r\nwith the concentrated hatred of my soul I surround you, my enemies! No\r\nlonger with a single voice, or with a vain enthusiasm, am I to meet you;\r\nbut with the sharp swords and strength of men governed by my will I seek\r\nour last encounter!\r\n\r\nIt is a noble thing to be the leader in this contest; to look even from\r\nthe bed of death, if so it must be, upon the strange power added to my\r\nown single arm through the many wills subjected to my rule; and glorious\r\nto gaze thus down upon you, my enemies, lying far below in the abyss and\r\ncrying up to me from the depths, as the damned cry up to heaven!\r\n\r\nYet a few hours more of time, and then I, with thousands of the\r\nmiserable wretches who have forgotten and renounced their God, will be\r\nno more forever--but come what will, one day of life at least is left\r\nme--I will enjoy it to the utmost--I will rule--combat--live! Is this my\r\nlast song?\r\n\r\nThe sun sets behind the cliffs; sinks in a long, dark shroud of\r\nvapor--on every side his rays pour blood into the valley. Foreshadow of\r\nmy bloody death, I greet thee with a more sincere and faithful heart\r\nthan I was wont to salute the allurements of pleasure, deception,\r\nenchantment, love, in the past days of my youth!\r\n\r\nNot through low intrigue, through cunning skill, through laborious\r\neffort, have I attained the fulfilment of my wishes; but suddenly and\r\nunlocked for, as I have ever dreamed I would!\r\n\r\nRuler over those who were but yesterday my equals, I have reached the\r\naim of my ambition: I stand on the very threshold of the eternal sleep!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A hall in the castle lighted with torches; George reclining upon a\r\n     bed; the Man enters, and places his weapons upon a table.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Let a hundred men keep guard upon the bulwarks, the remainder\r\nmay repose after our long and exhausting combat!\r\n\r\nVOICE (_without_). So help me God the Lord!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. You must have been frightened, George, with the noise of our\r\nattack, the firing of musketry, the cries of the soldiers!\r\n\r\nBut keep up your courage, my child; we shall not be taken to-day, nor\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nGEORGE. I have indeed heard it all distinctly, but it is not that which\r\nstrikes terror to my heart; the thunder of the cannon flies on and is\r\nhere no longer--it is something else that haunts me, that appals me,\r\nfather!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. You fear for me, George?\r\n\r\nGEORGE. No. I know your hour has not yet struck.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. A heavy weight has fallen from my heart to-day, for in the\r\nplain below, scattered like autumn leaves, lie the corpses of our foes,\r\nfoiled in their fierce attack.\r\n\r\nCome, George, we are alone, come! tell me all thy thronging thoughts; I\r\nwill listen to thee once more as of old in our own home!\r\n\r\nGEORGE (_hurriedly_). Follow me, then--follow me, father! A dreadful\r\ntrial--sentence--is reëchoed here every night. Oh come with me!\r\n\r\n     He goes to a door in the wall hidden by a heavy fall of tapestry,\r\n     and opens it.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. George! where art thou going? Who has made known to thee this\r\nsecret passage into endless vaults covered with eternal darkness? to\r\nthis black charnel house, where moulder the bones of earlier and\r\ncountless victims?\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Where thine eye, accustomed to the sunshine, has no power to\r\npierce, my spirit presses forward.\r\n\r\nGloom roll on to gloom--and darkness gather unto darkness!\r\n\r\n     He enters the door, followed by his father, and rapidly descends\r\n     into the vault.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A long, vaulted, subterranean dungeon. Grates, bars, chains, and\r\n     broken instruments of torture. The Man, with a torch in his hand,\r\n     stands at the base of a great block of granite, on the top of which\r\n     stands George.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Come down to me, George, I implore!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Hearest thou not these voices? Seest thou not these forms?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. All is still as the grave--and almost as dark. The light of the\r\ntorch is instantly swallowed up by the damp chill gloom around us!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Listen! Ever nearer! ever clearer! One after another they are\r\nslowly filing on from the depths of the narrow vaults--they are solemnly\r\nseating themselves below, far in the background; behind thee, father!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Thy madness is my damnation! Thy mind is wandering, my poor\r\nchild; thou art destroying the strength which I now so sorely need!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. I see their pale and stately forms as they collect for fearful\r\njudgment! I see the prisoner approach the dreadful bar, his tall form\r\nseems.... I cannot discern his features--they float and flow like\r\nmorning mist! Hark!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF VOICES. We, once chained, beaten, tormented, choked with dust\r\nand broken with stones, through the Power now given to our hands,\r\nproceed in our turn to sentence!\r\n\r\nWe too will judge and torture; try and condemn; Satan himself will\r\ndelight to assume the execution of our sentence.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. George, what dost thou see?\r\n\r\nGeorge. The prisoner! the prisoner, father! He wring his hands--O\r\nfather! father!\r\n\r\nA VOICE. With thee dies out the accursed race; all its power, all its\r\npassions, all its pride, have joined in thee to perish!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF VOICES. _Because thou hast loved nothing--revered nothing save\r\nthyself and thine own thoughts--thou art condemned--art damned to all\r\neternity!_\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I see nothing, but I hear from every side--above--below--sighs\r\nand wails--judgment, threatening, and eternal doom!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. The prisoner! he raises his haughty head as thou dost, father,\r\nwhen thou art angered! He answers with proud words, as thou dost, when\r\nthou scornest--father!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF VOICES. In vain! thou plead'st in vain! there is no redemption\r\nfor him more, in earth or heaven!\r\n\r\nA VOICE. Yet another day of passing earthly glory, of all share in which\r\nthine ancestors have robbed me and my brethren--and then thou fallest\r\nforever--thou, with thy brethren!\r\n\r\nYour burials will be, as once were ours, without the toll of holy\r\nknells, without tears, sobs, or wailing mourners, without friends,\r\nwithout relations, and you will die transfixed upon the same rock of\r\nuniversal human pain!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. I know you, wretched ghosts! wandering stars amid the angelic\r\nhosts!\r\n\r\n     He goes forward into the darkness.\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Father! go not into that fearful gloom! Father! in the name of\r\nJesus Christ--I implore--I conjure thee--father!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_turning toward his son_). Whom do you see below? Speak, and\r\ntell me truly, George!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. The prisoner--he is thyself, my father!\r\n\r\nHe is white as snow--gagged--chained--they drag him on--they torture\r\nthee, my father!\r\n\r\nI hear thy gasping breath--thy groans--thy sobs! (_He falls upon his\r\nknees._) Forgive me, father! My mother shines through the dark--and\r\ncommands me to....\r\n\r\n     He falls back in a fainting fit.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_catching the falling boy in his arms_). This alone was\r\nwanting! Ha! my own, my only child has led me to the brink of hell!\r\n\r\nMary--inexorable spirit! God!!\r\n\r\nAnd thou, second Mary, to whom I have so often prayed!\r\n\r\nHere then is the beginning of eternal darkness, eternal torture!...\r\n\r\nBack! back into life! one day of glory is at least still left me! First\r\nmust I combat with my fellow men--and then for my eternal struggle!\r\n\r\nCHORUS OF SPIRITS (_dying away in the distance_). _Because thou hast\r\nloved nothing, revered nothing, save thyself and thine own\r\nthoughts--thou art, damned to all eternity!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     A large hall in the castle of the Holy Trinity; arms and armor hang\r\n     upon the walls, with various Gothic ornaments. The Man; women,\r\n     children, some old men, and nobles are kneeling at his feet. The\r\n     Godfather stands in the centre of the hall, and crowds of men are\r\n     in the background.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. No, no. By my son--by the memory of my wife--never! never!\r\n\r\nVOICES OF WOMEN. Have mercy upon us! Hunger gnaws our bowels; our\r\nchildren die of famine; fear is upon us day and night; have pity upon\r\nus!\r\n\r\nVOICES OF MEN. It still is time! Listen to the herald--dismiss not the\r\nenvoy!\r\n\r\nGODFATHER. I regard not your reproaches, Count Henry, for my whole life\r\nhas been that of a good citizen.\r\n\r\nIf I have assumed the office of ambassador, which I am at this moment\r\nfulfilling, it is because I understand the age in which we live, and\r\nestimate our times aright.\r\n\r\nPancratius is, if I may so express myself, the representative of the\r\npeople....\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Out of my sight, old man!--(_Aside to Jacob._) Bring a\r\ndetachment of soldiers hither!\r\n\r\n  Exit Jacob.\r\n\r\n     The women rise from their knees weeping and sobbing, and the men\r\n     draw back a few paces.\r\n\r\nA BARON.--We are all lost, and through you alone, Count Henry!\r\n\r\nSECOND BARON. We renounce all further obedience.\r\n\r\nA PRINCE. Let us arrange for ourselves the terms of the surrender of\r\nthis castle with the worthy envoy!\r\n\r\nGODFATHER. The great man who sent me here secures life to you all, if\r\nyou will enter into a league with him and acknowledge the justice of the\r\nstruggle of the century.\r\n\r\nMANY VOICES. We acknowledge it.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. You have sworn to me, and I have sworn to you, to die upon\r\nthese walls; I intend to keep my oath, and you shall be true to yours.\r\nYou are all to die with me!\r\n\r\nHa! can you indeed still wish to live?\r\n\r\nHa! ask the spirits of your fathers why, when living, they were guilty\r\nof such continuous oppression, and why they ruled with so much\r\ncruelty!--(_To a Count._) Why have you, count, oppressed your\r\nserfs?--(_To another._) Why have you passed your youth in cards and\r\ndice, and your life in the land of the stranger?--(_To another._) Why\r\nhave you crept before the great, and scorned the lowly?-(_To one of the\r\nwomen._) Why did you not bring up your sons to defend you? As knights\r\nand soldiers, they might then have served you now; but you have\r\npreferred dealings with Jews and lawyers: call upon them, then, for life\r\nand safety.--(_He rises and extends his arms toward them._) Why hasten\r\nye thus to shame? why wrap your last hours in shrouds of infamy?\r\n\r\nOn with me, ye knights and nobles! On, where bayonets glitter, swift\r\nballs whistle!\r\n\r\nOh seek not the accursed gallows prepared for you by the New Men;\r\nbelieve me, the masked and silent hangman stands waiting to throw the\r\nrope of shame around your high-born throats!\r\n\r\nA VOICE. He speaks the truth--to our bayonets!\r\n\r\nANOTHER VOICE. We die of hunger; there is no more food!\r\n\r\nVOICES OF WOMEN. Our children! Your children! Mercy!\r\n\r\nGODFATHER. I promise you safety--safety of life and limb....\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_approaching the Godfather, and seizing him y the shoulder_).\r\nSacred person of the herald, go! Go, and hide thy gray hairs in the\r\ntents of Jews and low mechanics, that I may not dye them in thine own\r\nbase blood!\r\n\r\n     Jacob enters with a division of armed men.\r\n\r\nTake aim at this brow, furrowed with the folds of idle learning! Aim at\r\nthis liberty cap, which trembles on the brainless head before every\r\nbreath from the lips of a man!\r\n\r\n     The Godfather escapes.\r\n\r\nALL _cry, with one breath_: Bind Count Henry! Deliver him up to\r\nPancratius!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Wait but a single moment, lords! (_He goes from one soldier to\r\nanother._) Do you remember when we climbed a mountain's rocky slope, a\r\nsavage wild beast closely tracked our steps, and when you, frightened,\r\nfell into a yawning chasm, I rescued you, and saved your life? You\r\nwere most grateful then. Have you forgotten it?--Jerome, we once\r\nwere cast away upon the Danube's craggy shore; we braved the waves,\r\nand saved our lives; we were bold swimmers, and we helped each other\r\nwell!--Christophe, Hieronymus, you sailed with me upon the wild Black\r\nSea; we were young sailors then!--(_To others._) When the fire destroyed\r\nyour homes, who built your cottages anew?--(_To others._) You fled to me\r\nfrom cruel lords, and I redressed your wrongs.--(_Addressing himself to\r\nthe men generally._) Reflect, and choose!... Speak! will you arm with me\r\nto battle for our rights, or will you leave me here to die alone--with\r\nhaughty smiles upon my stiffening lips, because, among so many men, I\r\nfound no single _man_?\r\n\r\nTHE MEN. Long live Count Henry! we desert him not--vivat!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Let the remaining meat and brandy be shared among them; then\r\nupon the walls!\r\n\r\nSOLDIERS. Meat and brandy, and then upon the walls!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Go with them, Jacob, and in an hour be ready to renew the\r\nfight!\r\n\r\nJACOB. So help me God the Lord.\r\n\r\nWOMEN. We curse thee, Count Henry, in the name of our innocent children!\r\n\r\nOTHER VOICES. We, for our fathers!\r\n\r\nOTHER VOICES. We, for our wives!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. And I breathe curses on all craven souls!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The wall of the fortress of the Holy Trinity. Troops are lying\r\n     scattered about. Broken rocks and stones strew the ground, mingled\r\n     with pikes and guns; soldiers are running to and fro; the Man leans\r\n     against a bulwark, and Jacob stands beside him.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_putting his sword into its sheath_). There can be no greater\r\npleasure than to play at danger when we always win; and when the time\r\ncomes to lose, one cast of the die, and all is over!\r\n\r\nJACOB. Our last broadside has driven them back for the moment, but I see\r\nthem below there, gathering to renew the storm; however, all is vain,\r\nfor since the world a world was, no one has ever escaped his destiny!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Are there any cartridges left?\r\n\r\nJACOB. Neither balls nor grapeshot: everything has its end!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Bring then my son to me; I would embrace him once more!\r\n\r\n  Exit Jacob.\r\n\r\nThe smoke from the powder has dimmed my eyes; it seems to me as if the\r\nvalley were swelling up to my feet, and again sinking back to its place;\r\nthe socks crack, and cross each other at a thousand angles, and my\r\nthoughts wander, flicker, quiver in the most fantastic forms. (_Seats\r\nhimself upon a wall._) It is not worth the trouble to be a man--nor even\r\nan angel; the highest archangel must feel, after some centuries of\r\nexistence, as we do after a few years of our fleeting life, utter\r\nweariness in his soul, and long, as we do, for mightier powers! Either\r\none must be God--or nothing....\r\n\r\n     Enter Jacob with George.\r\n\r\nTake some of the men with you, go through the castle, and drive all\r\nbefore you upon the walls!\r\n\r\nJACOB. Counts, princes, bankers?\r\n\r\n  Exit Jacob.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Come to me, my dearest son! place thy thin hands in mine, while\r\nI press my lips upon thy pure forehead; thy mother's brow was once as\r\nwhite and smooth!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Before thy men took up their arms to-day, I heard mamma's voice;\r\nher words came floating to me as soft and sweet as perfumed air; she\r\nsaid to me: '_George, thou wilt come to me this very evening, and sit\r\ndown beside me_.'\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Did she name me to thee?\r\n\r\nGEORGE. She said: '_This very evening I expect my son_.'\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_aside_). Is my strength to fail me, when I have almost reached\r\nthe end of the weary way? No, God will not permit it! For one moment's\r\nfiery madness, I will be thy prisoner to all eternity!--(_Aloud_). Oh,\r\nmy son! forgive--forgive the fatal gift of life! We part; and knowest\r\nthou for how long a time?\r\n\r\nGEORGE. Take me with thee, father, and leave me not! I love thee; oh,\r\nleave me not, my father--and I will draw thee on with me!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Our paths are widely sundered. Amid the choirs of happy angels\r\nthou wilt forget thy father--thou wilt bring me down no drop of cooling\r\ndew. O George! George! my son! my son!\r\n\r\nGEORGE. What dreadful cries! I tremble, father. Louder and louder,\r\nnearer and nearer comes the thunder of the cannon; the last hour--the\r\nprophesied--draws near!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Jacob! quick--quick--here!\r\n\r\n     A band of counts and princes cross the courtyard. Jacob follows\r\n     with the soldiers.\r\n\r\nA VOICE. You give us broken arms, and force us to the combat!\r\n\r\nANOTHER VOICE. Henry, have mercy on thyself!\r\n\r\nTHIRD VOICE. Weak, wearied, famished, drive us not upon the walls!\r\n\r\nFOURTH VOICE. Where do they drive us? where?\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. To death!--(_To George, folding him in his arms._) With this\r\nembrace I would fain bind thee to my heart forever, George! Alas! I know\r\nour paths are widely sundered: it may not be, my son! my son!\r\n\r\n     Struck by a ball, George sinks dying in his arms.\r\n\r\nVOICE (_from above_). To me! to me! pure spirit! Up to me, my son!\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Ha! to my aid, soldiers! (_He draws his sword, and holds it\r\nbefore the lips of the wounded boy._) The blade is crystal clear; no\r\nmoisture dims the cold and glittering steel! Breath and life already\r\ngone! O George, my son!\r\n\r\nHa! they are upon me! On I on! They are at last but a sword's length\r\nfrom me! Back! Back! into the abyss, ye sons of freedom. Back!\r\n\r\n     Rushing on of man, confusion, struggle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     Another part of the wall of the castle. Men in the distance in line\r\n     of battle. Jacob is seen stretched out upon the wall: the Man,\r\n     sprinkled with blood, hastily approaches him.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN. Faithful old man, what has happened to you?\r\n\r\nJACOB. May the devil reward you in hell for your obstinacy, and my dying\r\nagonies!\r\n\r\nSo help me God the Lord!\r\n\r\n     Dies.\r\n\r\nTHE MAN (_throwing away his sword_). I will need thee no longer, sword\r\nof my fathers! My son is in heaven--the very last of my retainers lies\r\ndead at my feet--the craven nobles have deserted their cause; already\r\nthey kneel before the victor, and sue and howl for mercy! (_Looking in\r\nevery direction around him._) There still is time; as yet the enemy are\r\nnot upon me! I will steal a moment's rest before....\r\n\r\nHa! the New Men scale the northern tower; they shout 'Count Henry'--they\r\nseek him in every direction!\r\n\r\nHere I am! here I am! here I am! But you are not to pronounce sentence\r\nupon me; the dead have already given in their verdict. I go to meet the\r\njudgment and justice of my God! (_He clambers up a steep cliff jutting\r\nout over the abyss._) I see thee, my eternity, as thou rapidly floatest\r\non to meet me, black with the shadows of eternal night! shoreless,\r\nlimitless, infinite! And in the midst of thy rayless gloom, like a\r\nburning sun, eternally shining, but illumining nothing, I see my God!\r\n(_He takes some steps forward, and stands on the brink of the\r\nprecipice._) Ha! they run, the New Men--they see me now! Jesus! Mary! O\r\nPoetry! be cursed by me, as I shall be to all eternity! Up, ye strong\r\narms! cut through these waves of air!\r\n\r\n     He springs into the abyss.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     The courtyard of the castle. Pancratius, Leonard; Bianchetti stands\r\n     at the head of a regiment of soldiers. The remaining princes and\r\n     counts, accompanied by their wives and children, file in before\r\n     Pancratius.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. Your name?\r\n\r\nA COUNT. Christopher von Volsagen.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. You have pronounced it for the last time! And yours?\r\n\r\nA PRINCE. Wladislaus, Lord of Schwarzwald.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. It shall be heard on earth no more! And yours?\r\n\r\nA BARON. Alexander von Godalberg.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. It is already erased from the list of the living. Go!\r\n\r\nBIANCHETTI (_to Leonard_). They have repulsed us for two long months;\r\ntheir arms are wretched, and their accoutrements utterly worthless.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. Are there many of them left?\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. They are all given over to you for execution, that their\r\nblood may flow as an example to the world. But if there is one among\r\nthem who can tell me where Count Henry hides, he shall have his life for\r\nhis information!\r\n\r\nMANY VOICES. He vanished from our sight at last.\r\n\r\nTHE GODFATHER. Great Pancratius, I appear as mediator between you and\r\nyour prisoners; spare these citizens of noble birth, because they have\r\ngiven up to you the keys and strongholds of the castle of the Holy\r\nTrinity!\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. I have conquered by my own strength, and need no mediator.\r\nYou will yourself take charge of their immediate execution!\r\n\r\nTHE GODFATHER. My whole life has been that of a good citizen. I have\r\nfrequently given proof of true patriotism. When I joined your cause,\r\nPancratius, it was not with the intention of leading my own noble\r\nbrethren to--....\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS (_interrupting him_). Seize the old pedant! away with him!\r\nlet him join his _noble_ brethren!\r\n\r\n     The soldiers surround the Godfather and the prisoners.\r\n\r\nWhere is Count Henry? Has no one seen him, dead or living? A purse of\r\ngold for Henry, if only for his corpse!\r\n\r\n     A division of soldiers descend the wall from above.\r\n\r\nTHE LEADER OF THE DIVISION. Citizen general! by the command of General\r\nBianchetti, I stationed myself with my detachment, on the west side of\r\nthe bulwark; upon our entrance into the fort on the third bastion to the\r\nleft, I observed a man standing, unarmed, but bleeding and wounded, by a\r\ndead body. I cried immediately to my men: 'Hasten your steps, we must\r\nreach him!' but before we could approach him, he ascended a steep cliff\r\noverhanging the valley, stood for a moment on a sharp and jutting point\r\nof rock, and fixed his haggard eyes upon the depths below. I saw him,\r\nthen, extend his arms like a swimmer about to make a sudden plunge; he\r\nthrew himself forward with all his force; I saw him a moment in the air,\r\nand we all heard the noise made by the fall of the body as it pitched\r\nand fell from rock to rock into the abyss below.\r\n\r\nThis is the sword which we found but a few steps from the spot on which\r\nwe first observed him.\r\n\r\n     He hands a sword to Pancratius.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS (_examining the sword_). Drops of blood stain the handle, but\r\nhere are the arms of his house! It is the sword of Count Henry!\r\n\r\nHe alone among you all has kept his plighted faith; to him be endless\r\nglory--to you, traitors, the guillotine!\r\n\r\nGeneral Bianchetti, you will see that the fortress of the Holy Trinity\r\nis razed to the ground, and will also superintend the execution of the\r\nprisoners!\r\n\r\nLeonard!\r\n\r\n     He withdraws with Leonard.\r\n\r\n     A bastion on the north tower. Pancratius, Leonard.\r\n\r\nLEONARD. You require repose after so many sleepless nights; you look\r\nwearied and exhausted with ceaseless labor.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. The hour of rest has not yet struck for me, and the last\r\nsigh of the last of my enemies marks the completion of but half my task.\r\nLook upon these heavy mists, these swamps, these desert plains; they\r\nstand between me and the realization of my plans. Every waste on earth\r\nmust be peopled, rocks removed, lakes and rivers everywhere connected; a\r\nportion of the soil must be awarded to every human being; the teeming\r\nhosts of the living must far outnumber the multitudes who have perished;\r\nlife and universal prosperity must fill the place of death and ruin,\r\nbefore our work of general destruction can be at all atoned for. If we\r\nare not to inaugurate an era of social and widespread happiness, our\r\nwork of havoc and devastation will have been worse than vain!\r\n\r\nLEONARD. The God of Freedom will give us power for gigantic tasks.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. What! _You_ speak of _God!_ Do you not see that it is\r\ncrimson and slippery here--that we are standing deep in human gore?\r\n\r\nWhose blood is this beneath our feet?\r\n\r\nThere is nothing behind us save the court of the castle; no one is near\r\nus. I know that we are quite alone, and yet, Leonard, I feel there is\r\nanother here!\r\n\r\nLEONARD. I see nothing but this bloody corpse.\r\n\r\nPANCRATIUS. It is the corpse of his faithful old servant--that is only a\r\ndead body; but a spirit haunts this spot, and stands beside me; this\r\ncap--see, _his_ arms are embroidered upon it; Count Henry's shield;\r\nlook, Leonard! there is the jutting rock o'erhanging the abyss--upon\r\nthis very spot _his_ great heart broke!\r\n\r\nLEONARD.

In a measure this is true, but\r\nit is not true of the cities which have been opened to foreign trade, or\r\nin fact of any of the Chinese cities where foreigners have been settled\r\nsince the war of 1857 and treaties of 1858.\r\n\r\nSince that time the progress of Shanghai, Foo-Chow, Amoy, and Hong-Kong\r\n(which last, however, is purely a British colony) has been amazing, and\r\nmen who visited China ten years ago would not recognize these places.\r\nIndeed, it is not unlikely, with the rapid extension of Chinese trade,\r\nand the removal of the prejudices of the people, that the history of\r\nChinese cities, like those of the Western States and California, will\r\nhave to be rewritten every ten years to be at all correct.\r\n\r\nThis is peculiarly the case in respect to Shanghai, which, from an\r\ninsignificant place, almost unknown in the western world, has sprung up\r\nto an importance in trade surpassing that of any city on the China\r\ncoast. It has, from its proximity to the tea district, and easy\r\ncommunication with the vast country watered by the Yang-tze river, taken\r\nalmost without an effort the great trade that once centred in Canton,\r\nand every year shows a greater amount of tonnage in the Woosung river,\r\nand larger exports of tea, silk, and cotton.\r\n\r\nApproaching the entrance to the Woosung river from the Pacific, the\r\nwaters of the Yang-tze are plainly discernible at sixty to seventy miles\r\nfrom its mouth, and when near the point where the ship's head is turned\r\nfrom the broad current of the great river into that of the Woosung, a\r\nthick, yellow mud rolls out with the tide, and discolors the water as\r\nfar as the eye can reach. It is like the waters of the Nile or the\r\nMississippi, turbulent in the great tideways, and heavy with the\r\ncoloring matter of the soil it has washed for thousands of miles. It is\r\nevident that we are approaching a great commercial city, although for\r\nmiles we can see only a low coast, well cultivated, but without signs of\r\na town. The number of ships and steamers passing in and out on a fine\r\nday would remind a New Yorker of the fleet that is always beating\r\nthrough the Narrows, or is to be seen from the heights of Neversink. In\r\nthe three hours it took us to run from the light-ship to the anchorage\r\nat Woosung, no less than seven large steamers passed us, outward bound.\r\n\r\nThe tide in the Yang-tze and its branch, the Woosung, runs with\r\ntremendous force, having a rise and fall of eighteen feet at spring\r\ntides, and few ships are able to proceed beyond Woosung with a single\r\ntide, Shanghai lying twelve miles above. They anchor among a fleet of\r\nnative junks from the trading places on the Yang-tze, bound to the same\r\nport, and awaiting a change of tide, which the Chinese sailors celebrate\r\nby a great hubbub on the poops of their unwieldy-looking vessels, with\r\ntom-toms and other instruments of the same nature. This fleet of junks\r\nand sampans is a curious sight to the stranger approaching the China\r\ncoast for the first time, and, with a ramble through the filthy village\r\nof Woosung, occupies the time which the tides compel him to spend there.\r\n\r\nThe junks give proof that if there have been great changes in the trade\r\nof China and in the appearance of the cities where foreigners have\r\nestablished themselves, there certainly has been none in the mode of\r\nship building, and in the thousand curious and uncouth ways of working,\r\nacting, and living which have been for generations handed down from\r\nfather to son, and which are at the present time in no ways altered from\r\nwhat they were a thousand years ago. No people in the world are slower\r\nin admitting the ideas of foreign nations, or in taking advantage of the\r\nmost obvious improvements daily before their eyes; and, although the\r\nimprovements introduced by English and Americans in steamers and vessels\r\nadapted for the navigation of their rivers are so far acknowledged by\r\nthem as to lead to the discontinuance of junk building to a marked\r\nextent, yet the vessels they now build are of the same uncouth, clumsy,\r\nand expensive shape as the first they ever put on the stocks.\r\n\r\nTheir anchors are still of wood, and occupy the greater part of the\r\nvessel before the foremast; and, instead of cables, they still have\r\nimmense coils of rough rope like a hair lariat. The sails are still of\r\nbamboo mats, although occasionally a piece of good American or English\r\nduck is to be seen, stretched on bamboos in the style of the\r\nold-fashioned square sail, and once, on the river Min, we saw a native\r\npilot-boat rigged with the regular fore-and-aft cut, her sails having\r\nevidently been fashioned by a foreign hand.\r\n\r\nOut of hundreds of junks moored in the Woosung river it was impossible\r\nto find one without the great staring eye under what is called, by\r\ncourtesy, the bows, and not a few of them had the open mouth of a\r\ndragon, with ugly teeth, painted under it, near the water-line, the\r\ncorners being drawn down, and the eye (from their desire that it should\r\nsee 'all ways at once') having a horrid squint. This gave to the boat a\r\nlugubrious expression--if such a term may be allowed--ludicrous in the\r\nextreme; and with fifty or a hundred junks drawn up in squadrons,\r\nsquinting and making faces at each other, nothing more thoroughly\r\nChinese could well be imagined.\r\n\r\nConspicuous among this fleet were the timber vessels, which were so\r\nloaded as to be able to move only with the tide. The art with which\r\ntheir lading was tied to the vessels, so as to preserve their shape\r\nwhile stretching far over the water on either side, was admirable; and,\r\nout of fifty timber junks, all seemed to be loaded in precisely the same\r\nmanner. This was accomplished by laying the ends of the poles, tied in\r\nfagots, toward the bows, while their smooth, round butts were exposed to\r\nthe action of the tide. The sticks being of uniform length and\r\nthickness, tapering evenly, and about twenty feet long, it was easy to\r\narrange their fagots so as to give them the swelling lines of a ship,\r\nand enable the junk to breast the storms of the coast without damage to\r\nher cargo.\r\n\r\nWoosung, itself, is a place of no interest whatever--a filthy village,\r\nwith a market place on the river; the remains of old forts in its\r\nneighborhood, and extensive rice and cotton fields about it, presenting\r\nthe only points worthy of note.\r\n\r\nThere is an old Joss house on the outskirts of the village, occupied by\r\nthe French as a barracks, or 'garrison of occupation for the protection\r\nof the coast,' as a cadaverous old soldier told us, manned by twenty-six\r\nsoldiers, without earthworks or protection of any kind. They constitute\r\nthe 'foreign population' of Woosung, and might as well be drafted to\r\nsome more healthy locality for any good that they can do. Such as we saw\r\nlooked like men just recovering from cholera or yellow fever.\r\n\r\nWhile lying at Woosung waiting for the tide to change, we were\r\nfrequently reminded that we could not be far from a great commercial\r\nentrepôt of the world, by seeing five or six large ships, of one\r\nthousand tons each, rush past with the tide in as many hours, tea-laden\r\nand bound to Europe; but none of our company were prepared for what we\r\nsaw as we first rounded the point where a good view of Shanghai is\r\nobtained, and saw, in the brilliant light of a harvest moon, the dense\r\nforest of masts that filled the river. I have seen the mass of shipping\r\nin the Pool at London, and in the Mersey at Liverpool, in the East river\r\nat New York, and the Delaware at Philadephia, in Boston and San\r\nFrancisco harbors, and in all the other ports of China, and among them\r\nall Shanghai holds no mean rank. The summer of 1863, from peculiar\r\ncircumstances, the dullness of freights elsewhere, and the depredations\r\nof the Alabama and other piratical cruisers, called to the China coast,\r\nand especially to Shanghai, as fine a fleet of clippers as was to be\r\nfound in any port of the world; and on that bright mid-summer night we\r\nfound them anchored in three parallel rows, crossing the channel of a\r\nriver half a mile wide, and stretching for a mile and a half, if not two\r\nmiles, up and down before Shanghai.\r\n\r\nInterspersed among these ships of all nations whose flags are known on\r\nthe seas, were steamers of all sizes, from the little tugboat to the\r\nlarge steamers, like the Poyang of fifteen hundred tons, plying on the\r\nYang-tze and between the ports on the China sea, the Yellow sea, and in\r\nJapan. Of these, no less than seventy-one belong to or trade with\r\nShanghai, and at that time there could not have been less than forty in\r\nport.\r\n\r\nBeyond the vessels at anchor in the stream, the space to the very banks\r\nof the river was filled up and covered by a cloud of Chinese junks,\r\nsampans, and river boats of every class and name.\r\n\r\nWe were before one of the great cities of the world, or one that is yet\r\nto be known as among its most flourishing. The moonlight was reflected\r\nfrom a long row of stately buildings, palaces in extent and noble\r\nproportions, which lined the bank of the river for more than a mile.\r\nThese were the residences and mercantile houses of the merchants, the\r\npublic buildings, and the 'foreign concessions' in general, as they are\r\ncalled. Beyond them could be seen the dim, turreted outlines of the\r\nChinese city, now closed and hushed for the night, but seemingly of vast\r\nextent. The first and overruling impression here, as in all European\r\nsettlements on the China coast, except Canton and Swatow, was the grand\r\nscale on which everything was done. The residences or hongs of the\r\nmerchants seemed planned by liberal minds, and executed by as liberal\r\nhands. Space and money are not spared, and to obtain coolness and\r\ncomfort in so hot a climate, the ceilings of rooms are made very high,\r\nfew of the houses having more than two stories. Generally the material\r\nis the small, over-baked and dark-colored brick of the Chinese, overlaid\r\nwith stucco; but occasionally a house is seen built of stone, one or two\r\nof the largest and most valuable being entirely of granite. Generally\r\nthese hongs stand in spacious enclosures, or _compounds_, filled with\r\nrare tropical trees and the bamboo so common in China.\r\n\r\nThe finest residences are on the river bank or Bund, as it is commonly\r\ncalled; but the city stretches for several squares back from the river,\r\nbeing densest in the English Concession. The American quarter, Hong-Que,\r\nalthough not as well filled with fine houses, is the next in importance,\r\nwhile the French Concession, nearest to the great city within the walls,\r\nis meanly built, and has more of the native element than either of the\r\nothers. For, although it is contrary to Chinese law for any native to\r\nhold property in any of the foreign possessions, in practice large\r\nnumbers of Chinamen rent tenements from their foreign owners, and even\r\nown them, the property standing, for convenience' sake, in the name of\r\nsome foreign resident in trust. Thus there has gradually grown up around\r\nand upon the concessions a large Chinese city, believed by many to\r\ncontain almost as large a population as the city within the walls. This\r\nis not incredible when we consider that the excesses of the Tae-Pings in\r\nSoo-Chow, a large city about thirty miles from Shanghai, have driven\r\nvast numbers of its inhabitants to the latter place, which, being\r\nalready densely crowded, has overflowed its walls, and, as the presence\r\nof Europeans has made Shanghai, as it were, a city of refuge for the\r\nexiles, they have naturally crowded around the foreign settlement. In\r\nthis manner the population of Shanghai and its environs has been\r\nprodigiously augmented within the last two years, and from a place of\r\nsix hundred thousand inhabitants, it has become one of more than a\r\nmillion of people. It is extremely difficult to obtain even an\r\napproximate estimate of the population of a Chinese city. The estimates\r\nof the Chinese are totally unreliable, varying sometimes in the most\r\nridiculous manner, and generally being preposterously exaggerated, while\r\nthe estimates of strangers or foreigners, unacquainted with the\r\nmarvellous abundance of human life in very small spaces, as it is seen\r\nin China, are very rarely correct. For instance, it is not uncommon to\r\nfind that residents of this city differ as much as a million of people\r\nin their views of its population, their estimates ranging from nine\r\nhundred thousand to two million. It is not unlikely that a medium\r\nbetween these two extremes will prove to be correct, the figure twelve\r\nhundred thousand appearing to be the favorite at present among those\r\nconversant with the great changes of the last year.[1]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this vast increase in so short a period has led to great\r\nmortality among the Chinese, from the dense crowding it has occasioned,\r\nand in the summer months they are severe sufferers from Asiatic cholera,\r\nwhich rages among them with shocking mortality. The air, even of the\r\nforeign concessions, becomes tainted by the foul miasma rising from the\r\nChinese city, and no part of Shanghai can be esteemed healthy in the\r\nmonths of July and August. A more perfect system of drainage in the\r\nforeign concessions will probably lessen the mortality among Europeans,\r\nand it is pleasing to note that this matter is now receiving the\r\nattention which should have been given to it years ago; but no system of\r\nlaws or attempts at organizing better sanitary arrangements can\r\nseemingly be successful among the Chinese themselves. Large sums of\r\nmoney are now appropriated annually for these purposes, according to\r\ntheir own account, but the mandarins embezzle it, the work is left\r\nundone, and the filth and horrible stench of a Chinese city is\r\nindescribable; it is something monstrous. Europeans and Americans,\r\naccustomed to their own cleanly cities, cannot conceive of it. New York\r\nstreets have an unenviable notoriety on the Western continent for their\r\ndirty condition, but New York is a garden of roses compared with a\r\ngenuine Chinese city, such as Shanghai within the walls. Even the\r\nChinese, who might be supposed to be accustomed to it, carry little bags\r\nof musk to their noses as they ride through in their sedans; and half\r\nthe Chinese women one meets in Shanghai hold the nostril with the\r\nforefinger and thumb, with a grace and dexterity only acquired by long\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nMr. Fortune, the celebrated botanist[1] and indefatigable Chinese\r\ntraveller, gives to Tient-sin the glory of being the filthiest and most\r\nnoisome of Chinese cities, although he mentions Shanghai with high\r\nhonor. Canton, from which Europeans have mainly derived their ideas of\r\nChina, is comparatively a clean and neat place, far superior to the more\r\nnorthern cities.\r\n\r\nTo descend from generalities to particulars. The smells are a horrible\r\ncompound, worse than in Coleridge's 'City of Cologne.' First and\r\nforemost are the sewers, which are all open, the deposits of the\r\nnight-soil of the city, with convenient wells at every corner and in\r\nniches in the walls. At these are to be found, at all hours, men with\r\nbuckets slung on bamboos, filling them for transportation in these\r\nprimitive open vessels to the farmers, who use the compost on their\r\nfields. These wretches, with their vile burdens, are met at every turn,\r\nand pass through the streets and roads in long files, loading the air\r\nwith abominations. No attention is paid to the wells and sewers until\r\nthey overflow, and, as chance may direct, the coolies take their loads\r\nfrom the most convenient.\r\n\r\nThis is a terrible nuisance, but it is hardly worse than the odors which\r\narise from the innumerable cook shops, and from the peripatetic bakeries\r\nat every corner. What they are cooking, no man knows, but if not dog\r\nchow-chow, it is sure to be fried in some vegetable oil that sends up a\r\nmighty vapor, hiding the cooks and rolling into the narrow street, where\r\nit scarcely finds vent between the overhanging eaves of the houses. The\r\nsickening smell of the castor bean seems everywhere. Occasionally the\r\nsight and powerful odor of hard-boiled and rotten goose eggs, split open\r\nto show that they are either rotten or half hatched, attract the Chinese\r\nepicure. The oily cakes and crullers that the wandering baker is frying\r\nfor a group of children, powerfully offend European olfactories,\r\nalthough so tempting to the half-naked brats. Many different and\r\noffensive odors come from these greasy cook shops, but the offence in\r\nalmost every instance can be traced home to the vegetable oils, greasy\r\nand rancid, which seem to pervade all Chinese cookery, as it is seen in\r\nthe streets of the cities. Many of the dishes, but for this oil, would\r\nbe quite tempting; and such, as have tasted them in the houses of the\r\nrich, assure us that they are not so bad as they smell. The\r\nmuch-talked-of edible bird's-nest soup is really a fine dish. The\r\nsubstance, after it is prepared, all the dirt and feathers being\r\nseparated from it, is as clean and pure as isinglass, which it greatly\r\nresembles in appearance. Great care is taken to make it pure before it\r\nis sold for use, and in the shops at Canton it may be seen in every\r\nstage of manufacture. Their ducks and geese are fine birds, and, with\r\nexcellent pork, and their never-failing rice, are the favorite dishes of\r\nsuch as can afford them; which, by the way, they really know how to\r\ncook--an art that is very little understood in England or America.\r\n\r\nDog chow-chow, kittens, rats, and mice, with crickets and locusts, are\r\nonly eaten by the vilest of the vile--poor wretches, who must support\r\nthemselves and families on a pittance of about fifteen or twenty dollars\r\na year.\r\n\r\nOf course there are many things in their way of cookery, and in their\r\ntastes for such articles as sharks' fins, fish maws, _beche-de-mer_,\r\netc., which are revolting to an educated stomach; but in their way the\r\nChinese are quite as dainty as the most fastidious of other lands, and\r\nin fine vegetables, fish, and fruits they enjoy as much variety and\r\nevince as discriminating a taste as any people in the world. Their fish\r\nare sold in the markets alive, and taken from the tanks as selected by\r\nthe purchaser. Their way of drinking tea will be found, after\r\nfamiliarity, superior to ours, for when milk is not used the finer aroma\r\nof the leaf is obtained. Indeed, they are very particular in regard to\r\nthe quality and decoction of their tea, totally refusing the poisonous\r\ngreen teas that are consumed in such quantities in England, and\r\nespecially in America.\r\n\r\nThey know, too, how to draw it, and just at the right moment the boiling\r\nwater is poured upon the leaf, and, without allowing it to simmer by the\r\nfire, as we do, long enough to get the flavor of the stalks and stems,\r\nthey drink it off as soon as the boiling water has fairly acted upon the\r\ndelicate leaves. English tea-drinkers, who like to mix a green and a\r\nblack tea, and allow it to steam for a quarter of an hour to make it\r\nstrong, complain that Chinese tea is mere dishwater, just as the man\r\naccustomed to get boozy on brandy, made 'fiery' with sulphuric acid, has\r\nno taste for the light French wines. A Chinaman colors his green tea\r\nwith Prussian blue for his foreign customers, who like a bright, pretty\r\ncolor; but he is too wise to drink it. This process of coloring we have\r\nseen, publicly, in the tea factories of Shanghai; and the disgust with\r\nwhich the manufacturer denied that he ever drank his own wares, was too\r\nstrong to be assumed. 'No good,' was his only reply.\r\n\r\nDespite the filth and many disagreeable things to be encountered in a\r\nwalk or ride through a city like Shanghai, it is one of the most\r\ninteresting places imaginable in which to spend an hour or two on a\r\nsummer morning.\r\n\r\nIn the heat of the day, at mid-summer, it is dangerous in China, and\r\nespecially to a new comer, to be exposed even to the reflected rays of\r\nthe sun, and many a poor fellow has lost his life by neglect or contempt\r\nof the cautions of his more experienced friends not to be in the\r\nsunshine between the hours of 10 A. M. and 4 P. M. More than ordinary\r\nprecaution is necessary in times of cholera, owing to the peculiar\r\nelectrical condition of the atmosphere, in which any exertion or\r\nexposure is often fatal to one recently arrived on the coast. All\r\nexcursions to the city are therefore, of necessity, made in the morning\r\nor late in the afternoon. The gates are opened at daybreak, and the\r\nearly visitor is almost certain to be unpleasantly reminded of the\r\nprevalence of cholera by the number of dead bodies lying in the streets.\r\nThey are those of coolies, or poor persons, who have died during the\r\nnight, and having no friends, the public authorities must take them\r\nwherever they chance to die, and provide for their burial. In August,\r\n1863, at a time when the cholera was not particularly virulent, the\r\ndeaths were supposed to be five hundred a day, principally among the\r\npoor, who, from insufficient food, miserable lodging in the streets and\r\nporticoes of temples, and constant exposure in the day to the direct\r\nrays of the sun, to say nothing of the filth and foul air of the city,\r\nwere peculiarly exposed to the ravages of disease. Another sign of the\r\npresence of cholera, and an odd one, was the number of persons passing\r\nwith necks disfigured by perpendicular parallel bars, as if branded by\r\nhot irons. This curious remedy is applied for any pain in the stomach,\r\nhowever slight, even for sea sickness, and the marks are made with\r\nstrong pincers. By the Chinese it is thought very efficacious, although\r\non what theory it is difficult to understand.\r\n\r\nEntering the city from the north gate, after crossing the ditch that\r\nseparates the walls from, the French Concession, we find ourselves in\r\nclose and extremely narrow streets, with shops opening upon them,\r\nneither glass nor any partition separating them from passers by. The\r\nsame arrangement is quite common in our own streets for fruit-sellers'\r\nshops, toy stores, and newspaper and periodical stands. But instead of\r\none or two attendants at a stand, in China we find a dozen, in summer\r\ntime naked from the waist upward, emaciated by opium smoking, and having\r\na sickly look painful to see. Most of the shops have a carved railing\r\nand a counter facing the street, the ends of which are ornamented by\r\ngrotesque shapes of dogs and gilded idols. A figure of a pug-nosed dog\r\nwith bandy legs is very common. At the first glance it would be supposed\r\nthat this was one of those nondescripts the Chinese are so fond of\r\ndevising, but a closer examination shows that the figure is an admirably\r\nlife-like copy of an odd dog, common to Pekin, pug-nosed and\r\nbandy-legged, and no doubt his form will be recognized in many of the\r\ngrotesque, awkward-looking figures of which ivory carvings abound in all\r\ncountries where Chinese curiosities are to be found.\r\n\r\nStanding on the counter is generally a roll of joss-sticks wound\r\nspirally around a wire frame, and always burning to the tutelary idol of\r\nthe shop, for the sake of good luck. It is the duty of one of the boys\r\nto see that this coil of joss-stick is always lighted--a very convenient\r\narrangement for tobacco smokers strolling through the streets. Another\r\ncustom which they have, and which is also supposed to bring success to\r\nthe shopkeeper, is to encourage the swallows to build under the eaves\r\nand among the bamboo rafters. Three or four of these nests of swallows,\r\nwith broods of twittering young ones, may often be observed in a single\r\nshop, neat stretchers of cotton cloth or bamboo being built under the\r\nnests, to prevent any possible damage to the goods. The birds seem quite\r\nat home amid all the hubbub; and the kind care which protects them amid\r\na semi-barbarous people is one of those traits of a common humanity--of\r\nkindness to the helpless--which marks the common origin of the most\r\ncivilized and most barbarous of the human race. The streets of Shanghai\r\nare not divided among the trades, as in Canton, but shops of all kinds\r\noccur in every crooked lane and alley-way. Principal among them are the\r\ncookshops, some of which are evidently restaurants on a large scale, for\r\nthey are filled, from morning till night, with half-naked coolies,\r\neating indescribable dishes, of which rice is the great staple, and\r\nsipping tea. They all sit at little tables, built for two, or at round\r\ntables, seating half a dozen. In the country and in the suburbs these\r\nlast are drawn out into the open air at sunset, and are occupied by\r\nparties taking their tea in a social manner. The roads around Shanghai\r\nare fall of such parties on a warm summer's eve.\r\n\r\nAfter the cookshops, the confectioners' attract the traveller's eye. An\r\nimmense amount of sweetmeats is consumed by the people, and the\r\nconfectioners' shops are proportionally numerous. They are distinguished\r\nby copper caldrons sunk in their counters, which are kept always hot and\r\nfull of molasses. With a ladle like a milkman's pint measure, they bring\r\nup the sweet mass for their customers, and their stalls are always\r\ncrowded. Not only are these established shops well patronized, but an\r\nimmense quantity of candy and preserved fruits is sold by the wandering\r\npeddlers, who manufacture and dispose of their good things wherever they\r\nfind customers. Preserved lychee, a fruit that looks like a small prune,\r\nand like it is stewed in sirup, is a great favorite; and the coolies in\r\nthe foreign quarters, while resting under their burdens, are not\r\nbackward in disposing of a saucer of sweetmeats obtained from the\r\nnearest peddler. These sweetmeats, of all kinds, are esteemed very good\r\nby Europeans, and no doubt are quite the same as we receive from China\r\nput up in big-bellied blue jars; but as sold in the streets, the lack of\r\ncleanliness in the entire outfit of the shop, and the necessity of using\r\nthe dishes and China spoons from which one can see the neighboring\r\ncoolies gobbling their purchases, holding the dishes up to their very\r\nnoses, would deter any man of ordinary fastidiousness from attempting an\r\nimmediate experiment to establish their identity.\r\n\r\nAfter eating, we must rank shaving as the second among Chinese\r\nemployments. They all wear the cue, even to the infant in arms, whose\r\nmother shaves its head at three months old, and ties up the tiny cue\r\nwith a red ribbon, and from that day to the day of his death the child\r\nand man must be periodically shaved; for, of course, no man can shave\r\nhis own head. Great is the barber in China, and vast his field of\r\noperations among four hundred millions of people! They shave their\r\nsubjects everywhere, even sitting on a stone in an open field, and at\r\nall hours of the day their shops are full. It is in the neatness of his\r\n'shave' and the glossiness of his rich black cue that the Chinese dandy\r\nis distinguishable. Men who cannot afford to shave every day, allow the\r\nhair to grow until the head (always excepting the part which has never\r\nknown the razor or the shears) resembles that of a fire zouave just\r\nafter enlistment, or a penitentiary prisoner; while the exquisite has\r\nhis head shaved with the sharpest razor, giving a bluish cast or frame\r\nfor his yellow face. Occasionally the size or thickness of the tail\r\nappears to be unsatisfactory, and a larger surface is spared from the\r\nknife. The refractory hairs growing out in this supplementary patch\r\nsurround the genuine cue with a halo an inch or two in height. Lots of\r\nthese apostolical-looking Chinese are to be met with in every street,\r\nand, as they rarely wear hats, they have a very comical appearance. This\r\nquestion of hats is another of curious import among this curious people.\r\nA Chinese gentleman rarely wears one in the streets, his mode of travel\r\nbeing in a sedan, and his fan or umbrella answering all purposes of\r\nprotection from the sun. A mandarin, on the contrary, wears in the ball\r\nof his cap his badge of office, and the time even when he changes his\r\nwinter for his summer hat is regulated by the Board of Rites. The poor\r\ncoolie is troubled by no such formality, and wears a great umbrella-like\r\nhead covering, that he perches on a little bamboo tower, six inches\r\nabove his crown, tying down the whole concern by a string that passes\r\nbehind his ears. When at leisure, he wears his long cue trailing to his\r\nfeet; when busy, it is snugly coiled around his head and out of sight\r\nunder his hat. The gentleman and mandarin, on the contrary, never ties\r\nup the cue, its flowing grace, like his long finger nails, being a badge\r\nof his superior condition in being above manual labor. No wonder, then,\r\nthat they attach so much importance to the pigtail, and that the man who\r\ndresses it daily is so useful a character in the community. His tools\r\nare unlike anything a civilized barber uses, and his razor, if its uses\r\nwere not explained, would hardly be recognized by the name. It is a\r\nthick, broad instrument, shaped more like a cook's cleaver than any\r\ninstrument known to other nations; but it does its work well in the\r\nhands of a good operator. After the head is shaved, it is washed with\r\nwarm water in an old-fashioned brass barber's basin, such, as was in use\r\nin England two hundred years ago, and, after having had the few\r\nstraggling hairs on lip and chin removed, the patient (for truly he\r\ndeserves the name) goes through the torture of having all stray hairs\r\nextracted from the inner coating of the nose and ears, an absurd and\r\nbarbarous custom that often leads to permanent injury of the latter\r\norgans. If he chances to have ophthalmia, the barber considers that his\r\neyes need cleaning, and proceeds to wipe out the inner side of the\r\neyelid with his instrument, of course to their serious injury. In the\r\nophthalmic hospitals of Chinese cities European physicians have found\r\nthis practice a fruitful cause of many diseases of the eyes, but no\r\nremonstrances can induce the people and their barbers to give it up.\r\n\r\nThe mustache, as well as the pigtail of immoderate length, is a badge of\r\na certain dignity, for no man is allowed to cultivate it until he\r\nreaches a certain age, and it is an error to suppose that Asiatics are\r\ntotally devoid of beard, for the old fellows among them sport grisly\r\nbeards and mustaches of respectable length, and altogether have quite a\r\nvenerable look. On the stage the emperor and mandarins are represented\r\nas bearded like Turks. Indeed the excessive length of their horse-hair\r\nmustaches, reaching to their girdles, shows what esteem the people\r\nattach to a long, flowing beard.\r\n\r\nOn first landing in China, the impression given by so many long-tailed\r\nand petticoated men is like the memory of a dream wherein one has seen\r\nanimals walking like men; and, although custom makes the sight familiar,\r\na Chinaman always appears an odd creature, especially when he passes the\r\nend of his pigtail under his left shoulder and gently caresses it or\r\ntwists the final braid. A comical sight, to be seen almost every day in\r\nHong-Kong, is a sepoy policeman leading some Chinese culprit to the\r\nlockup: the sepoy, tall and erect, with fierce mustaches, lean as a\r\ntiger, and with a warlike air, leading along the meek Chinaman by the\r\nend of his pigtail, John Chinaman following at about two paces behind,\r\njust at the end of his natural tether.\r\n\r\nWe have already alluded to the grotesque appearance of an infant a few\r\nmonths old, with close-shaved head, and pigtail two inches long, tied up\r\nwith a gay ribbon. When the youngster is four years old, and his pigtail\r\nhas reached the dignity of seven inches, it is duly braided, and\r\nconstitutes his only dress. Then, being armed with a basket, he is sent\r\nout in this primitive and absurd costume to pick chips.\r\n\r\nAfter the barbers, in order of importance among the Chinese shopkeepers,\r\ncome the coffin makers, and they are very important men indeed, in a\r\ncountry where the worship of ancestors is carried to a degree unknown\r\nelsewhere in the world. Their coffins are of all sizes and degrees of\r\nfinish, but of one invariable shape. Some of those seen in Shanghai cost\r\nas much as one thousand taels, equal to $1,500 in American gold. They\r\nare extremely massive, more like miniature junks than the shape we are\r\naccustomed to associate with the idea of a coffin, the head being higher\r\nthan the foot, and the lines of the sides swelling gently with very\r\nlittle taper. The boards of the sides and headpiece are at least three\r\ninches thick, elaborately carved, and gilded in Chinese characters. The\r\ncolors are various, black and red predominating. As the body is kept in\r\nthis massive shell for several months after decease, and in the house of\r\nthe nearest relative, the good sense of making the walls of extra\r\nthickness and strength is very apparent. Even after it is laid in the\r\ntomb, in many parts of the country, the style of sepulture allows the\r\ncoffin to be seen, and it is even exposed to the weather in some cases.\r\nCustoms differ greatly, however, in different parts of the country. In\r\nthe flat region about Shanghai, the tombs are found mostly around the\r\nlittle streams flowing into the Yang-tze, or the ocean. The coffins are\r\nplaced in the open fields, a few shovelfuls of earth are thrown around\r\nthem, and they are left undisturbed, for the high weeds and the\r\naccumulations of centuries to form mounds around them. A few regularly\r\nconstructed tombs are to be found, but they are rare. In the hill\r\ncountry bordering the China sea, in the province of Foh-Kien, and\r\nelsewhere on the coast, when the nature of the land will allow,\r\nextensive tombs are hollowed out in the sides of the hills, and the\r\ncoffins are deposited out of sight. Here a whole family reposes, it may\r\nbe, in one of these majestic tombs (for, seen from a distance, they have\r\na picturesque and imposing appearance). The popular shape is that of a\r\nhorseshoe or half moon, the circle being toward the summit of the hill.\r\nThis portion of the tomb is raised like a crown, and facing it is an\r\naltar, with Chinese characters engraven on its pillars, where the\r\nofferings of the relatives or worshippers are placed. Before this is a\r\nplace like a court, railed off and flanked, it may be, by smaller altars\r\non either side, facing other entrances, where the less venerated members\r\nof the family are interred. In front of the whole are two high posts,\r\nthe meaning or use of which, if they have any at all, we are not\r\nacquainted with.\r\n\r\nOn these altars are burnt the paper offerings sent to their departed\r\nfriends, the manufacture and sale of which occupy a numerous and\r\nimportant class of shops in the great cities. These offerings are\r\ngenerally of gilt and silver paper, in the form of clothes, horses,\r\nhouses, and other conveniences of which their friends showed their\r\nappreciation on earth, and which, by a subtile process of reasoning,\r\nthey imagine that they can transmit to them in this cheap and ingenious\r\nmanner--simply by burning these paper effigies at the altars by the\r\ntombs! One of the most ingenious and economical of these contrivances,\r\nwhereby, with a subtlety of argument worthy of the great trafficker in\r\nindulgences, Tetzel, who so raised Martin Luther's ire, they manage\r\ncheaply to transmit funds to heaven, is the paper dollar, strings of\r\nwhich are sold in the shops, looking exceedingly like goodly bunches of\r\nthe silvery onion. It is worthy of a people who are so niggardly in all\r\ntheir transactions, who have a copper currency that would sink any man\r\nwith a fortune invested in it, and who cheat all that come in contact\r\nwith them, that they should cheat their departed friends with these\r\nremittances, a bundle of which are to be obtained for a few cash, and on\r\nreaching the other world are understood to pass for a little fortune. In\r\nthe ordinary affairs of life it is their habit to put three prices on\r\neverything they have to sell, and in their dealings with heaven they put\r\ntheir own valuations, amounting to an advance of several thousand per\r\ncent., on all their offerings. Could anything be more thoroughly in\r\ncharacter?\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a certain degree of respect paid to the memory of\r\ndeparted friends, and an attachment to the soil where lie the bones of\r\ntheir ancestors, that, in as far as it is harmless, is entitled to our\r\nrespectful consideration. It gives a domestic, settled character to the\r\npeople, that is worthy of all praise, and should raise them in our\r\nestimation, from whatever cause it may spring. It is well known that\r\nthey show the highest respect to the aged, and that those who emigrate\r\nto foreign lands show the greatest anxiety that after death their\r\nremains should be sent back to their own country. Ships from San\r\nFrancisco are often largely freighted with the coffins of deceased\r\nChinamen; and it is worthy of note that few or none of these belong to\r\nmen born in Shanghai, the Chinese seen in other lands coming almost\r\nexclusively from Canton, Ningpo, and Amoy. The northern and middle\r\npopulation of China is not by nature so restless a class as that of the\r\nsouth, and has borne this character since Europeans have been at all\r\nacquainted with the Chinese.\r\n\r\nThe three kinds of shops to which allusion has been made, those of the\r\ncooks, the barbers, and the undertakers, comprise more than one half of\r\nall in Shanghai; but besides these are almost as many varieties of\r\ntrades as we are accustomed to in other more civilized countries.\r\nBankers sit behind their counters, keeping watch over tons of copper\r\ncash, neatly threaded in strings of one thousand each, and pay checks\r\nand make loans with the same regularity as in cities boasting their\r\nsuperior civilization. Nor are the resources of these native bankers to\r\nbe despised. On proper security native and foreign merchants have been\r\nknown to obtain loans of several hundred thousand dollars from one\r\nbanker. Many of their daily operations are for very considerable\r\namounts, and are adjusted in credits or in silver. Although they are\r\ncursed with as abominable a currency as any nation in the world, they\r\ndo not appear to experience any great difficulty in settlements, every\r\nmerchant having his balance, and weighing off the proper amount of\r\nsilver, larger payments being made in sycee. This want of a currency\r\narises from their utter lack of confidence in the coinage of their own\r\ncountry. No currency that the Imperial Government might issue, not like\r\nthe copper cash, or tsien, incapable of adulteration, would be above\r\nsuspicion; and while the shameless system of mandarin plunder and fraud\r\ncontinues, it is hopeless to expect a proper currency in China, unless\r\nthe foreigners interfere or obtain the control in this part of the\r\nnational affairs which they already have over the customs and the army.\r\nA uniform currency, superior to the wretched, worthless cash, is the\r\ncrying need of China. The Mexican, or chop dollar, becomes sadly\r\ndepreciated after long circulation, by the clippings and innumerable\r\nmarks put upon it, so that it will not pass outside of China, nor does\r\nit long remain out of the pot of the sycee melter. The American half\r\ndollar and quarter and the English shilling are daily becoming more\r\npopular for the smaller transactions of the shops, and the notes of the\r\nlocal banks possess considerable circulation in their respective cities;\r\nbut what is needed more than anything else is an abundance of small\r\nsilver coinage for the daily ordinary transactions. The Mexican mint is\r\nquite inadequate to supply so vast and insatiable a country as China,\r\nwhich should have a currency of its own. No doubt much larger quantities\r\nof silver will continue to reach China directly from California, within\r\nthe next few years, in the shape of bars. The great impetus which the\r\nlate wild speculations in silver shares is likely to give to the\r\ndevelopment of the Washoe mines, is almost certain within a very few\r\nyears to so largely increase the yield of California silver as to rival\r\nin amount the immense produce of her gold mines. Careful surveys and the\r\nactual yield of mines, such as the Gould & Curry, and Hale & Norcross on\r\nthe Comstock lead, prove that the ore is there in large quantities, and\r\nthe stimulus has now been applied which will rapidly bring it to light.\r\nWith the increasing facilities between San Francisco and Hong-Kong the\r\nbulk of this must go to China direct, instead of the roundabout course\r\nby which it has reached the East through London. But these are questions\r\nthat hardly attract attention at present in Shanghai, or among the\r\nShanghai bankers, whose shops we were talking of as met with here and\r\nthere in the open street.\r\n\r\nNext to one of these respectable, long-tailed gentlemen we found a\r\nfirst-class apothecary, whose shop and mode of business were widely\r\ndifferent from those of one of the guild at home. The ceilings were\r\nswarming with swallows, whose chattering rivalled that of the folks\r\nbelow, conspicuous among whom was a fat, greasy old chap, in the dignity\r\nof a gray mustache and a monstrous pair of colored spectacles, the\r\nglasses of which were an inch and a half in diameter, rimmed with horn,\r\nand tied by a string to his ears. He was gravely busy in compounding a\r\nprescription on a piece of paper large enough to cover the side of a\r\nchest of tea, and closely written over with Chinese characters. We\r\nlounged by his side as he put up packet after packet of dried roots and\r\nsimples, tasting many of them with his consent. Calamus and liquorice\r\nwere among them, and camphor, too. Each packet was of the size of a\r\npound paper of Stuart's candy (any child can tell you what size that\r\nhas), and when the entire prescription was filled, the unfortunate sick\r\nman became possessed of no less than twenty-three of these packages,\r\nenough to keep famine from his door for a week at least, to judge from\r\ntheir bulk. They filled a goodly basket. It was not one man alone who\r\ncarried away such a heap of medicines; but before each applicant, as the\r\nprescriptions spread on the counter were ticked off, rose a pile of\r\nsimilar packages, which bid fair to become as high as that which had\r\nexcited our curiosity. All these drugs were put up neatly in the\r\nlight-yellow paper we are accustomed to see round our packs of\r\nfire-crackers, and as neatly sealed with a little gum arabic. Indeed, it\r\nis shrewdly suspected by Father Hue, from this prodigious liberality of\r\ndrugs, that the physicians feel bound to give a man all he pays for, in\r\nthe hope that out of a multitude of remedies some may chance to suit his\r\ncase. The foreign residents of Shanghai aver that the doctors take\r\ncontracts to cure their patients in a certain time, and if unsuccessful\r\nat the stipulated day, their patients relieve their minds by a little\r\nelegant abuse of their physician, and take the contract to the next in\r\ntheir neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to see their dentists wandering through the streets\r\nwith rows of old fangs suspended from their necks like necklaces,\r\ntrophies of their skill; and every dead wall in the city has its\r\nvermilion posters, advertising some great quack medicine, so that it is\r\nquite evident that the science of medicine has reached that pitch of\r\nrefinement where a host of quacks can ply their arts with as much\r\nsuccess as among the western barbarians.\r\n\r\nHeaven save us, though, from a Chinese doctor! Mechanical surgery is his\r\nforte; for a stomach ache he will pinch your neck; for a broken rib he\r\nwill nearly crack the bones of your arm, and if you faint under this he\r\nwill hang you up by your heels to restore the circulation.\r\n\r\nAccording to the diagrams published in the books on medicine, the\r\nknowledge of anatomy possessed by the faculty in China is very slight,\r\nand entirely erroneous; and in all their cures it is very probable that\r\nnature, unassisted except by rest and fasting for a season, does the\r\nwork. They certainly are able to give her very little help.\r\n\r\nIt is noticeable, however, as a proof of the high esteem in which the\r\npeople hold the science, that the shops of the chemists and apothecaries\r\nare kept by a superior class of people, more intelligent in appearance\r\nthan their neighbors, and holding a higher rank.\r\n\r\nOf the lower trades there are innumerable shops, the variety of which is\r\nalmost bewildering. Every art and manufacture has its minute\r\nsubdivisions, and one meets, at every step, signs of the superior\r\ncivilization of the people in their admirable division of labor. Silk\r\nlooms are working in the open streets, shoemakers and tailors are each\r\nplying their art in their narrow shops. In one they manufacture little\r\npaper offerings for the gods, in another the gods themselves, in the\r\nnext their worshippers are supplied with joss-sticks or gayly colored\r\ncandles of tallow, mounted on slim sticks, that they may be stuck in the\r\nsand before the divinity. Here you will find a printer hard at work\r\ntaking impressions on their delicate paper; next a bookbinder, who sews\r\nthe leaves with withes of paper, while in the next shop you can procure\r\nthe almanac for the year, months before it is required. In August, 1863,\r\nthey were selling copies of the almanac for 1864. Probably this work has\r\nthe largest circulation of any in the world, hanging, as it does, in\r\nevery house. The only exception may be the Bible, which, it is to be\r\nhoped, will yet be as widely circulated in China as it is among the\r\nother nations of the world.\r\n\r\nNumbers of the people are engaged in the delicate carving we so much\r\nadmire in the ivory toys scattered throughout Europe and America, and a\r\nvast number of people in preparing the hanging screens with curious\r\ndevices, quaint pictures, and sentences from Confucius, which are found\r\nin almost every house of the better class. They have a great fondness\r\nfor the proverbs and wise sayings which, are thus kept always before\r\ntheir children, like the very good rules and aphorisms we see on the\r\nwalls of our Sunday schools.\r\n\r\nA good example of the minute subdivision of the Chinese trades is seen\r\nin the shops devoted exclusively to the sale of camel's-hair pencils,\r\nand others for that of the little squares of red paper, covered with\r\nhieroglyphics, which we receive on a pack of fire-crackers, and which\r\nconstitute its 'chop.'\r\n\r\nJewellers' shops contain very little interesting to a foreigner--most of\r\nthe rings and brooches are trashy articles of jade-stone, a greenish\r\nstone which resembles agate or cornelian in opaqueness. The armlets are\r\nof silver, and of the same substance are the large thin circles worn by\r\nthe women of Foh-Kien in the ear and resting on the shoulder. Pins for\r\nthe fantastic pyramid they erect with their rich black hair are rather\r\npretty, but are generally ornamented with false pearls. For pearls the\r\nChinese have a passion, but it requires a judge of the article to\r\npurchase any from them, nine tenths of those in the shops being\r\nfictitious. Seed pearls are also used by them as medicines. In the back\r\nstreets it is not uncommon to find places where they make them, and\r\nothers where artists are engaged in cutting and polishing on the lathe\r\nthe few precious stones they possess. Rock crystal is one of their\r\nfavorites, and from it they cut beautiful vases and goblets that are\r\nsometimes as clear as glass. In this, however, they are surpassed by the\r\nJapanese, whoso crystal globes cannot be distinguished from the most\r\nperfect glass. They also cut vases and carve odd figures in an arsenical\r\nstone, of reddish color, with a grain like granite, which is little\r\nknown in other countries.\r\n\r\nIn Shanghai the shops for the sale of china and porcelain-ware do not\r\npresent as fine an assortment as those of Canton, where vases costing\r\nfabulous sums are to be seen, but they are rich with the peculiar\r\npottery of Soo-Chow. Just at present the display of this ware is not as\r\nfine as usual, owing to the occupation of that city by the Tae-Pings,\r\nbut enough remains on hand to show its beauty and general usefulness.\r\nChinese porcelain ware is as well known in every civilized country of\r\nthe world as in China itself, and has ceased to be a curiosity unless\r\nwhen intelligently viewed in its historical character, for all these\r\nquaint scenes scattered over the magnificent vases we receive illustrate\r\nsome event in Chinese history, or some custom which obtains among the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nWhen evening approaches and the shops are lit up with lanterns, the\r\nnumerous and brilliant lantern warehouses attract the attention: some of\r\nthe goods they display (and at nightfall they light every lantern in the\r\nshop) are extremely beautiful and costly; all kinds are to be obtained,\r\nfrom the fine hall-lamp of painted glass to the sixpenny lantern to be\r\ncarried in the hand. At night these gay lights give much animation to\r\nthe busy streets. Having gone across Shanghai from the south gate to the\r\nFrench Concession one dark night, after the city gates were closed, a\r\ngood opportunity of seeing the interior of a Chinese city after\r\nnightfall (which few foreigners care to avail themselves of) presented\r\nitself. The people were slowly closing their shops for the night. Here\r\nand there a shopkeeper was counting his cash, and calculating at his\r\ncounter with the help of the abacus; many of them were sitting at the\r\ndoors of their houses, smoking in the evening air; the barbers were\r\nstill at work preparing their customers for the night. Like Washington\r\nIrving, these may have considered a good clean shave the best soporific.\r\nHere and there a citizen of the better class was to be seen picking his\r\nway by the light of a lantern, held by a boy, and twice we met sedan\r\nchairs containing women, preceded by a lantern bearer. The passage of\r\ntwo sedans in these narrow streets is a difficult and unpleasant\r\nprocess, the bearers generally managing to grind your shins against a\r\nwall. At night it is still more difficult to avoid contact, and the\r\ncoolies are incessantly shouting, in a sing-song voice, to prepare the\r\nway. As it was, in the narrower streets we passed between files of dusky\r\nfigures and black, inquisitive eyes, ranged on either side to barely\r\nallow passage. The cook-shops were deserted, and the attendants busy in\r\nputting out the fires; only the places where lanterns or candles were\r\nsold seemed to be doing an active trade, although it had scarcely struck\r\nnine. At ten o'clock no doubt all were asleep, for hosts of beggars and\r\npoor wretches were snoring by the roadsides. The most picturesque groups\r\npassed in this evening stroll were those on the bridges, where, by the\r\nlight of tallow candles, men and boys were gambling and fighting\r\ncrickets. Although probably there was not another European or American\r\nwithin the walls of the city, the passage was as safe as if made at\r\nnoonday, guarded by a file of soldiers.\r\n\r\nA visit to Shanghai would be incomplete if the traveller failed to\r\ninspect the numerous and very curious temples, and to contrast them with\r\nthe church edifices erected in the heart of the city by the Protestant\r\nmissionaries. There is one without the walls, in the French Concession,\r\nwhere all the instruments of torture, the devilish devices of heathen\r\ncruelty, are to be seen, a horrid spectacle. The largest of the temples,\r\nhowever, is within the walls, approached through a wide court, with a\r\nfountain (not in use) in the centre. This court is crowded with fortune\r\ntellers, conjurors, and gamblers of every kind. Some of these gentry\r\nplay a game very much like thimble-rigging, in which copper cash,\r\nappears under different inverted teacups. Every man who approaches the\r\nidol draws from among the fortune tellers a stick or a piece of paper,\r\nfrom the figure on which he is supposed to tell whether his prayer will\r\nsucceed, or the work he contemplates prove lucky. Entering the shrine,\r\nit is difficult to see for a few moments, so gloomy is the place and so\r\ngrimy every object with the smoke of joss offerings from time\r\nimmemorial. A kind of altar faces the worshippers, with a box of sand,\r\nin which are stuck the burning joss-sticks. Before this is a cushion, on\r\nwhich they prostrate themselves, telling their beads, as they recite\r\ntheir prayers inaudibly, and bowing to the earth at intervals of a few\r\nminutes. Behind the altar are the idols. These hideous figures are twice\r\nthe size of life, and of frightful shape and features, the principal god\r\nbeing in a tent-like shrine, which permits only a glimpse of his grim\r\nfeatures in the background. On his right hand is the figure of a man\r\nwith the beak of an eagle, and on his left a very grotesque divinity,\r\nwith a third eye, like that of the Cyclops, in the centre of his\r\nforehead. These two figures, again, are supported by gigantic guardians,\r\none on either side, who have nothing absolutely monstrous about them,\r\nbeing distinguished by their saturnine expression. That to the right\r\nhand bears a striking likeness to Daniel Webster's stern and well-known\r\nfeatures. The deep-set eye and compressed lip were those of the great\r\nexpounder.\r\n\r\nA heavy cloud from the burning candles and paper offerings filled the\r\nair, and the smell of candle snuff mingled with that of incense. A high\r\nrailing separated the worshippers from the idols, but the priests were\r\nquite indifferent and not at all exclusive; so, passing around and\r\nwithout removing our hats, we made a close inspection of the respected\r\ncarvings. A nearer view did not increase their attractions, so, passing\r\nup a flight of stairs, we entered a room where the bonzes were busy\r\npraying for rain and apparently going through a species of litany with\r\nopen books in their hands. Our entrance stopped proceedings for a\r\nminute or two, but they soon resumed, quite indifferently, singing and\r\ndrawling as though it were tedious, tiresome work.\r\n\r\nThey were all good-looking men, in the prime of life, dressed in scarlet\r\nand embroidered robes of much richness. Unlike the rest of the people,\r\nthey neither shaved nor wore the cue. We found them drawn in a line\r\nbefore the altar, from which they were separated by a screen: an open\r\nporch at their back let in light and air. Each priest had before him a\r\nlittle table with a fancy gilt screen upon it, and as they slowly\r\nproceeded with their drawl, at convenient intervals, each made a slight\r\nbow behind his screen, his head touching it. As they did this with the\r\nregularity of drilled soldiers, and to the pounding of a tom-tom, they\r\nevidently were chanting in chorus, although the ear would have failed to\r\ndistinguish it. The tom-toms and wooden drums were beaten at the\r\npleasure of the parties in charge: nothing like time was apparent to any\r\nbut a Chinese ear.\r\n\r\nThe idol was a little gilt figure, about six inches high, with the body\r\nof a beast and the head of a man. His peculiarity was the possession of\r\na supplementary eye, which, as his natural pair squinted horribly, no\r\ndoubt was very useful. His position was on a little table surrounded by\r\ntall candles; whether they were borrowed from the Roman Catholics or the\r\nCatholics borrowed the custom from them is a question for the student of\r\nchurch history. Before the idol was placed another table with ten\r\nelegant bowls, scarcely larger than our teacups, filled with the\r\nchoicest fruits and grains that the market afforded. Each article was\r\nperfect of its kind. Rice, tea, the nelumbium, and agaric, a species of\r\nfungus, were among them. Just then the country being in great want of\r\nrain, the priests were trying the coaxing process, and tempting the god\r\nwith the best chow-chow to be had; but the next day they got out of\r\npatience, and were to be met parading him through the dusty streets,\r\nexposed to a fierce sun, for the purpose of giving him to understand\r\nthat the heat was quite as disagreeable as they had represented it.\r\n\r\nTheir arguments for this proceeding are extremely logical: they say that\r\nJoss, in his cool temple, laughs at them, and is disposed to think that\r\nthey are humbugging him; therefore, if they give him two or three hours\r\nof good skin-roasting in the sun, he will be much more likely to come to\r\nterms, to avoid a repetition of the process. As they do this every day\r\nuntil rain comes, it is of course seen in a short time, if they are\r\npatient, that it never fails in the end.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is quite common to meet in all the large cities processions\r\nof priests, followed by the rabble, who are giving 'Joss an airing.' The\r\neminently practical object of these mummeries argues very little genuine\r\nrespect for the deity, an inference that has often been drawn by\r\nmissionaries from other points in their treatment of their idols.\r\n\r\nTheir worship of them, such as it is, is almost universal. Every house\r\nhas its shrine and altar, and even in the porches of foreign residents\r\nin the quarters occupied by the Chinese servants, one sometimes\r\n(although not often) sees a little figure in a niche, with a tiny\r\njoss-stick before it. Every junk and sampan has its tutelary idol. A\r\nlittle shrine of bamboo of the size of a common birdcage is built for\r\nit, sometimes fixed and sometimes movable. The interior of this was\r\ngilded once, but the gilt is worn and tarnished by smoke and water. It\r\nhas doors that open when the joss-sticks are to be burnt before the toy\r\nfigure that presides on a miniature throne. A sampan whose owners are\r\ntoo poor to supply themselves with decent clothing, will be sure to have\r\nits tawdry baby-house and doll idol, and it frequently has in addition\r\na roll of paper, four feet by one, like a window curtain, with, a gay\r\npicture of Joss, in a scarlet dress, in the act of dancing, and\r\ngenerally in a very absurd posture for such a respectable character.\r\n\r\nEvery evening at sunset there is a prodigious hubbub from the junks on\r\nthe Woosung, made with tom-toms, drums, and other unmelodious\r\ninstruments, which are vigorously beaten for ten or fifteen minutes, to\r\nbring good luck, and propitiate the devils, or frighten them away for\r\nthe night. From the shore, the rapid motions of a dozen arms on the high\r\npoop of each junk, tossed aloft in the dusk, and the discordant, harsh\r\nsounds that come from so many vessels at once, arrest the attention of\r\nthe stranger, and once seen and heard, are never forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe pagodas, so often mentioned in accounts of the Chinese empire,\r\nappear to be more numerous in the mountainous districts, where they add\r\ngreatly to the picturesque charm of the scenery, and are believed to be\r\nconnected with the religious ceremonies of the people. In the flat\r\ncountry around Shanghai they are not to be met with; at least it was not\r\nour fortune to see any during our brief stay. The only structure like a\r\ntower, if we except the turrets on the city walls and watch towers\r\nerected within the past few years, when the Tae-Pings have threatened\r\nthe city, is a tall, white monument, rising to the height of twenty\r\nfeet, and without inscription or distinguishing mark of any kind. It\r\nlooks like a fine, white tomb, higher and more ambitious than usual, and\r\ntruly it is a 'whited sepulchre'! Baby Tower, it is called by the\r\nforeign residents, for it is filled with the bones of infants--not such\r\nas have died a natural death, as Bayard Taylor asserts, but which have\r\nbeen thrust into this horrid monument of heathen cruelty when but a few\r\nhours old. Humanity shudders at the thought! These dazzling white baby\r\ntowers, with their mockery of purity, their object known to all men, and\r\nopenly inviting, as it were, the most unnatural and heartless of\r\nmurders, are among the most hideous spectacles to be met with in a\r\nheathen land. True, a river or a pond will be pointed out to you in\r\nother parts of China, or in India, where babies are daily drowned like\r\npuppies or kittens; but they do not affect the mind with such a horror\r\nas these palpable structures, erected with the best skill of their\r\narchitects for this express purpose. The water closes over the murdered\r\ninfant, and no trace of the crime remains; but here is a tower--a high\r\ntower--with deep foundations, filled with the bones of murdered babes\r\nthat have been accumulating for generations.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that Christian mothers, resident in the East, cannot speak of\r\nthem or see them without a shudder, and never willingly pass them in\r\ntheir drives. Who knows but they might hear, if they approached the\r\ntower, the wail of some poor infant just thrown in, or meet its father\r\nreturning from his cruel errand!\r\n\r\nAt Shanghai the Baby Tower stands on the southwest side of the city,\r\nwithout the walls, but at Foo-Chow, where the crime of infanticide is\r\nstill more prevalent, they use no baby towers, but have provided ponds\r\nfor this express purpose. It is the saddest part of this great national\r\ncrime of the Chinese, that it is sanctioned by the mandarins, and viewed\r\nas a disagreeable necessity, not as a crime.\r\n\r\nIt has been the fashion of late years to deny the existence of this\r\nabomination; the doubters, wise in their own conceit, insisting that the\r\ncrime is too great for human nature.\r\n\r\nHuman nature, unfortunately, has proved but a frail barrier to crime of\r\nthis character in all parts of the world, and the facts of Chinese\r\ninfanticide are indisputable. The witnesses are too numerous, the crime\r\nis too public, and the evidences of it too notorious to deny its\r\nexistence. The children destroyed are girls; the most common methods of\r\ndestroying them are: 1st, by drowning in a tub of water; 2d, by throwing\r\ninto some running stream; 3d, by burying alive. The last-named mode is\r\nadopted under the hope and with the superstitious belief that the next\r\nbirth will be a boy. The excuse is that it is too expensive to educate a\r\ngirl, but if some friend will take the child to bring up as a wife for a\r\nlittle boy, the parents will sell or give away the infant rather than\r\ndestroy it. The regular price is two thousand copper cash, or $2, for\r\nevery year of their lives; for sometimes a girl will be saved for a year\r\nor two, and then sold for a wife or slave. Many instances have come to\r\nthe notice of missionaries where large families of girls have been\r\ndestroyed. There is one woman now employed as a nurse in a missionary's\r\nfamily at Fuh-Chow, who says that her mother had eight girls and three\r\nboys, and that she was the only girl permitted by her father to live. We\r\nnever heard of an instance of a boy's being destroyed at birth. There is\r\na village about fifteen miles from Fuh-Chow, which is swarming with\r\nboys, but where girls are very scarce. The people account for it\r\nthemselves by alleging the common practice of killing the girls at\r\nbirth, a practice which is indulged in by the rich as well as by the\r\npoor.[2]\r\n\r\nBut to enter into all the particularities of Chinese life which attract\r\nthe attention at Shanghai as in other cities, would be to compile an\r\naccount of China and her customs.\r\n\r\nThe points of real importance to be considered in connection with\r\nShanghai, which is fast becoming the commercial centre of Chinese\r\nexports, are the extent to which foreigners have an influence on the\r\npeople in modifying their habits, increasing their knowledge, and\r\ndispelling their prejudices. The growth of European influence and the\r\ncomplete opening of the Chinese empire, in which immense advances have\r\nbeen made in the last three years, will, in time, it is to be hoped,\r\nlead to the diffusion of the Christian religion, a work attended with\r\nsuch gigantic difficulties, at the present day, that one cannot\r\nsufficiently admire the courage, patience, and faith which actuate\r\nmissionaries to this empire. No representations of these difficulties\r\nwhich reach the Christian world have done justice to them, for it is\r\nnecessary to observe the heartlessness, self-conceit, and prodigious\r\nprejudices of the Chinese to appreciate the noble zeal of the\r\nmissionaries. The course of trade and much more correct notions of the\r\npower and objects of the Western nations, and the firmness with which\r\nthey use the former to secure the latter, are unquestionably breaking up\r\nwith rudeness the ridiculous ideas of the Chinese concerning their own\r\nimportance and superior wisdom. If once they can be made learners in\r\ngood earnest, the battle is half won, for none doubt their intelligence.\r\nEuropean influence, alone, has effected great changes in five years, and\r\nEuropean and Chinese combined may, in the five years to come, work out\r\nstill greater reforms.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Sir Frederick Bruce, in a recent report to the Foreign\r\nOffice, says:\r\n\r\n'The growth of Shanghai is wonderful; its population is estimated at\r\n1,500,000, and it bids fair to become soon the most important city of\r\nthe East. The Chinese flock to it on account of the security it enjoys;\r\nand the silk manufacture, which was destroyed by the Taiping occupation\r\nof Soochow and Hangchow, is taking root at Shanghai.'--Pekin, 30th\r\nApril, 1863.\r\n\r\n[2] Civilized nations profess to look with abhorrence on the\r\nChinese crime of infanticide, and to believe that the statements of\r\ntravellers and missionaries are incredible; but a careful examination of\r\nthe mortuary tables of London, Paris, New York, Dublin, Moscow, and\r\nother cities, will show that infanticide is far more common than\r\nsupposed. It is a crime easily hidden and hard to trace. Take the\r\nfoundling hospitals as a guide to some approximate estimate of the\r\namount of infanticide in France. We find that she has upwards of 360\r\nhospitals; that in Paris alone, in five years, from 1819 to 1823, 25,277\r\nchildren were received, of whom eleven thirteenths died, and that the\r\nannual number of enfans trouvés ranges from 3,800 to 4,500. These\r\nchildren, but for the hospital, would have been murdered. Who can tell\r\nhow many are thrown into the sewers of Paris? A recent writer states the\r\nnumber at 10,000, but we deem this an exaggeration. It is significant\r\nthat the percentage of births and deaths in all France is less far the\r\nbirths and greater for the deaths than in England. These tables we\r\nannex.\r\n\r\nIt is still more significant that the returns of foundling hospitals,\r\nfrom widely different countries, show that these institutions, however\r\ncharitable and humane their object, are to be viewed as conveniences for\r\nmurdering an infant without the actual violence at which humanity\r\nrevolts. The proportion of abandoned children who live is so exceedingly\r\nsmall, that abandonment of a child to a foundling hospital is scarcely\r\nless than murder. If the child live, it may be viewed, almost, as a\r\ndirect act of Providence.\r\n\r\nOf 62,000 children brought into the Paris foundling hospitals, 52,500\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nIn Dublin, 19,420 children were received in ten years, of whom 17,440\r\ndied.\r\n\r\nIn Moscow, 37,000 children were received in twenty years, of whom 35,000\r\ndied.\r\n\r\n         COMPARATIVE VIEW OF MOVEMENT OF POPULATION OF\r\n-------------------------------------++------------------------\r\n                     ENGLAND.        ||         FRANCE.\r\n-----------+------------+------------++------------+-----------\r\n           |    1860.   |   1861.    ||   1860.    |   1861.\r\n-----------+------------+------------++------------+-----------\r\nPopulation | 19,902,918 | 20,119,496 || 35,597,461 | 36,752,565\r\nMarriages  |    170,156 |    163,706 ||    290,657 |    283,642\r\nBirths     |    684,018 |    693,406 ||    953,315 |    987,830\r\nDeaths     |    422,721 |    435,114 ||    782,764 |    848,174\r\n-----------+------------+------------++------------+-----------\r\n           |        Percentage.      ||        Percentage.\r\n-----------+------------+------------++------------+-----------\r\nMarriages  |    .855    |    .814    ||    .794    |    .772\r\nBirths     |   3.437    |   3.461    ||   2.605    |   2.688\r\nDeaths     |   2.124    |   2.163    ||   2.139    |   2.308\r\n-----------+------------+------------++------------+-----------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON HEARING A 'TRIO.\r\n\r\n\r\n  'All thoughts, all passions, all delights,\r\n    Whatever stirs this mortal frame,'\r\n  Thrilled through the wildering harmonies\r\n    That from the music came.\r\n\r\n  All soothing sounds of nature blent,\r\n    In wonderful accord,\r\n  With pleadings, wild and passionate,\r\n    From human hearts outpoured.\r\n\r\n  The wailings of the world's sad heart,\r\n    Oppressed with social wrongs,\r\n  In mournful monotones were mixed\r\n    With sounds of angel songs.\r\n\r\n  The falling of a nation's tears\r\n    O'er Freedom's prostrate form,\r\n  Dew droppings sweet from starry spheres,\r\n    Swift-rushing wings of storm.\r\n\r\n  The voices of Time's children three--\r\n    Past, Present, Future, blent\r\n  In that wild 'trio's' harmony,\r\n    Thrilled each fine instrument.\r\n\r\n  And, at the sound, my soul awoke,\r\n    And saw the dawning clear\r\n  Of Freedom's coming day illume\r\n    Earth's clouded atmosphere!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IDEAL MAN FOR UNIVERSAL IMITATION; OR, THE SINLESS PERFECTION OF\r\nJESUS.\r\n\r\n(A POSITIVE REPLY TO STRAUSS AND RENAN.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first impression which we receive from the life of Jesus, is that of\r\nperfect innocency and sinlessness in the midst of a sinful world. He,\r\nand He alone, carried the spotless purity of childhood untarnished\r\nthrough his youth and manhood. Hence the lamb and the dove are his\r\nappropriate symbols.\r\n\r\nHe was, indeed, tempted as we are, but he never yielded to temptation.\r\nHis sinlessness was at first only the _relative_ sinlessness of Adam\r\nbefore the fall, which implies the necessity of trial and temptation,\r\nand the peccability, or the possibility of the fall. Had he been endowed\r\nwith absolute impeccability from the start, he could not be a true man,\r\nnor our model for imitation; his holiness, instead of being his own\r\nself-acquired act and inherent merit, would be an accidental or outward\r\ngift, and his temptation an unreal show. As a true man, Christ must have\r\nbeen a free and responsible moral agent; freedom implies the power of\r\nchoice between good and evil, and the power of disobedience as well as\r\nobedience, to the law of God. But here is the great fundamental\r\ndifference between the first and the second Adam: the first Adam lost\r\nhis innocence by the abuse of his freedom, and fell by his own act of\r\ndisobedience into the dire necessity of sin; while the second Adam was\r\ninnocent in the midst of sinners, and maintained his innocence against\r\nall and every temptation. Christ's _relative_ sinlessness became more\r\nand more _absolute_ sinlessness by his own moral act, or the right use\r\nof his freedom in the perfect active and passive obedience to God. In\r\nother words, Christ's original possibility of _not sinning_, which\r\nincludes the opposite possibility of sinning, but excludes the actuality\r\nof sin, was unfolded into the _impossibility of sinning_, which _can_\r\nnot sin because it will not. This is the highest stage of freedom, where\r\nit becomes identical with moral necessity, or absolute and unchangeable\r\nself-determination for goodness and holiness. This is the freedom of God\r\nand of the saints in heaven, with this difference: that the saints\r\nattain that position by deliverance and salvation from sin and death,\r\nwhile Christ acquired it by his own merit.\r\n\r\nIn vain we look through the entire biography of Jesus for a single stain\r\nor the slightest shadow on his moral character. There never lived a more\r\nharmless being on earth. He injured nobody, he took advantage of nobody,\r\nhe never spoke an improper word, he never committed a wrong action. He\r\nexhibited a uniform elevation above the objects, opinions, pleasures,\r\nand passions of this world, and disregard to riches, displays, fame, and\r\nfavor of men. 'No vice that has a name can be thought of in connection\r\nwith Jesus Christ. Ingenious malignity looks in vain for the faintest\r\ntrace of self-seeking in His motives; sensuality shrinks abashed from\r\nHis celestial purity; falsehood can leave no stain on Him who is\r\nincarnate truth; injustice is forgotten beside His errorless equity; the\r\nvery possibility of avarice is swallowed up in His benignity and love;\r\nthe very idea of ambition is lost in His divine wisdom and divine\r\nself-abnegation.'\r\n\r\nThe apparent outbreak of passion in the expulsion of the profane\r\ntraffickers from the temple is the only instance on the record of his\r\nhistory which might be quoted against his freedom from the faults of\r\nhumanity. But the very effect which it produced, shows that, far from\r\nbeing the outburst of passion, the expulsion was a judicial act of a\r\nreligious reformer, vindicating in just and holy zeal the honor of the\r\nLord of the temple. It was an exhibition, not of weakness, but of\r\ndignity and majesty, which at once silenced the offenders, though\r\nsuperior in number and physical strength, and made them submit to their\r\nwell-deserved punishment without a murmur, and in awe of the presence of\r\na superhuman power. The cursing of the unfruitful fig tree can still\r\nless be urged, as it evidently was a significant symbolical act,\r\nforeshadowing the fearful doom of the impenitent Jews in the destruction\r\nof Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe perfect innocence of Jesus, however, is based not only, negatively,\r\non the absence of any recorded word or act to the contrary and his\r\nabsolute exemption from every trace of selfishness and worldliness, but,\r\npositively, also on the unanimous testimony of John the Baptist and the\r\napostles, who bowed before the majesty of his character in unbounded\r\nveneration, and declare him 'just,' 'holy,' and 'without sin.' It is\r\nadmitted, moreover, by his enemies: the heathen judge Pilate, and his\r\nwife, representing, as it were, the Roman law and justice, when they\r\nshuddered with apprehension and washed their hands to be clear of\r\ninnocent blood; by the rude Roman centurion, confessing under the cross,\r\nin the name of the disinterested spectators, 'Truly, this was the Son of\r\nGod;' and by Judas himself, the immediate witness of his whole public\r\nand private life, exclaiming in despair: 'I sinned in betraying innocent\r\nblood.' Even dumb nature responded in mysterious sympathy, and the\r\nbeclouded heavens above and the shaking earth beneath united in paying\r\ntheir unconscious tribute to the divine purity of their dying Lord.\r\n\r\nThe objection that the evangelists were either not fully informed\r\nconcerning the facts, or mistaken in their estimate of the character of\r\nChrist, is of no avail. For, in addition to their testimony, we have his\r\nown personal conviction of entire freedom from sin and unworthiness,\r\nwhich leaves us only the choice between absolute moral purity, and\r\nabsolute hypocrisy; such hypocrisy would, indeed, be both the greatest\r\nmiracle and the greatest moral monstrosity on record.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that Christ came for the express purpose of saving\r\nsinners, implies his own consciousness of personal freedom from guilt\r\nand from all need of salvation. And this is the unmistakable impression\r\nmade upon us by his whole public life and conduct. He nowhere shows the\r\nleast concern for his own salvation, but knows himself in undisturbed\r\nharmony with his Heavenly Father. While calling most earnestly upon all\r\nothers to repent, he stood in no need of conversion and regeneration,\r\nbut simply of the regular harmonious unfolding of his moral powers.\r\nWhile directing all his followers, in the fourth petition of his model\r\nprayer, to ask daily for the forgiveness of their sins as well as their\r\ndaily bread, he himself never asked God for pardon and forgiveness,\r\nexcept in behalf of others. While freely conversing with sinners, he\r\nalways does so with the love and interest of a Saviour of sinners. This\r\nis an undeniable historical fact, no matter how you may explain it. And\r\nto remove every doubt, we have his open and fearless challenge to his\r\nbitter enemies: 'Which of you convinceth me of sin?' In this question he\r\nclearly exempts himself from the common fault and guilt of the race. In\r\nthe mouth of any other man, this question would at once betray either\r\nthe height of hypocrisy, or a degree of self-deception bordering on\r\nmadness itself, and would overthrow the very foundation of all human\r\ngoodness; while from the mouth of Jesus we instinctively receive it as\r\nthe triumphant self-vindication of one who stood far above the\r\npossibility of successful impeachment or founded suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe assumption that Christ was a sinner, and knew himself such, although\r\nhe professed the contrary and made upon friends and enemies the\r\nimpression of spotless innocency, is the most monstrous deception that\r\ncan well be imagined. 'If Jesus was a sinner, he was conscious of sin,\r\nas all sinners are, and therefore was a hypocrite in the whole fabric of\r\nhis character; realizing so much of divine beauty in it, maintaining the\r\nshow of such unfaltering harmony and celestial grace, and doing all this\r\nwith a mind confused and fouled by the affectations acted for true\r\nvirtues! Such an example of successful hypocrisy would be itself the\r\ngreatest miracle ever heard of in the world.'\r\n\r\nIt is an indisputable fact, then, both from his mission and uniform\r\nconduct and his express declaration, that Christ knew himself free from\r\nsin and guilt. The only rational explanation of this fact is, that\r\nChrist _was_ no sinner. And this is readily conceded by the greatest\r\ndivines--even those who are by no means regarded as orthodox. The\r\nadmission of this fact implies the further admission that Christ\r\ndiffered from all other men, not in degree only, but in _kind_. For\r\nalthough we must utterly repudiate the pantheistic notion of the\r\nnecessity of sin, and must maintain that human nature, in itself\r\nconsidered, is capable of sinlessness, that it was sinless, in fact,\r\nbefore the fall, and that it will ultimately become sinless again by the\r\nredemption of Christ; yet it is equally certain that human nature, in\r\nits _present_ condition, is not sinless, and never has been since the\r\nfall, except in the single case of Christ, and that for this very reason\r\nChrist's sinlessness can only be explained on the ground of such an\r\nextraordinary indwelling of God in him as never took place in any other\r\nhuman being, before or after. The entire Christian world, Greek, Latin,\r\nand Protestant, agree in the scriptural doctrine of the universal\r\ndepravity of human nature since the apostasy of the first Adam. Even the\r\nmodern and unscriptural dogma of the Roman Catholic Church, of the\r\nfreedom of the Virgin Mary from hereditary as well as actual sin, can\r\nhardly be quoted as an exception; for her sinlessness is explained in\r\nthe papal decision of 1854 by the assumption of a miraculous\r\ninterposition of divine favor, and the reflex influence of the merits of\r\nher Son. There is not a single mortal who must not charge himself with\r\nsome defect or folly, and man's consciousness of sin and unworthiness\r\ndeepens just in proportion to his self-knowledge and progress in virtue\r\nand goodness. There is not a single saint who has not experienced a new\r\nbirth from above, and an actual conversion from sin to holiness, and who\r\ndoes not feel daily the need of repentance and divine forgiveness. The\r\nvery greatest and best of them, as St. Paul and St. Augustine, have\r\npassed through a violent struggle and a radical revolution, and their\r\nwhole theological system and religious experience rested on the felt\r\nantithesis of sin and grace.\r\n\r\nBut in Christ we have the one solitary and absolute exception to this\r\nuniversal rule, an individual thinking like a man, feeling like a man,\r\nspeaking, acting, suffering, and dying like a man, surrounded by sinners\r\nin every direction, with the keenest sense of sin and the deepest\r\nsympathy with sinners, commencing his public ministry with the call:\r\n'Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand;' yet never touched in the\r\nleast by the contamination of the world, never putting himself in the\r\nattitude of a sinner before God, never shedding a tear of repentance,\r\nnever regretting a single thought, word, or deed, never needing or\r\nasking divine pardon, never concerned about the salvation of his own\r\nsoul, and boldly facing all his present and future enemies in the\r\nabsolute certainty of his spotless purity before God and man!\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS ABSOLUTE HOLINESS.\r\n\r\nA sinless Saviour surrounded by a sinful world, is an astounding fact\r\nindeed, a sublime moral miracle in history. But this freedom from the\r\ncommon sin and guilt of the race is, after all, only the negative side\r\nof his character, which rises in magnitude as we contemplate the\r\npositive side, namely, absolute moral and religious perfection. It is\r\nuniversally admitted, even by deists and rationalists, that Christ\r\ntaught the purest and sublimest system of ethics, which throws all the\r\nmoral precepts and maxims of the wisest men of antiquity far into the\r\nshade. The Sermon on the Mount alone is worth infinitely more than all\r\nthat Confucius, Socrates, and Seneca ever said or wrote on duty and\r\nvirtue. But the difference is still greater if we come to the more\r\ndifficult task of practice. While the wisest and best of men never live\r\nup even to their own imperfect standard of excellency, Christ fully\r\ncarried out his perfect doctrine in his life and conduct. He both _was_\r\nand _did_ that which he _taught_; he preached his own life, and lived\r\nhis own doctrine. He is the living incarnation of the ideal standard of\r\nvirtue and holiness, and is universally acknowledged to be the highest\r\nmodel for all that is pure and good and noble in the sight of God and\r\nman.\r\n\r\nWe find Christ moving in all ordinary and essential relations of life,\r\nas a son, a brother, a friend, a citizen, a teacher, at home and in\r\npublic. We find him among all classes of society, with sinners and\r\nsaints, with the poor and the wealthy, with the sick and the healthy,\r\nwith little children, grown men and women, with plain fishermen and\r\nlearned scribes, with despised publicans and honored members of the\r\nsanhedrim, with friends and foes, with admiring disciples and bitter\r\npersecutors; now with an individual, as Nicodemus or the woman of\r\nSamaria, now in the familiar circle of the twelve, now in the crowds of\r\nthe people. We find him in all situations, in the synagogue and the\r\ntemple, at home and on journeys, in villages and the city of Jerusalem,\r\nin the desert and on the mountain, along the banks of Jordan and the\r\nshores of the Galilean Sea, at the wedding feast and the grave, in\r\nGethsemane, in the judgment hall, and on Calvary. In all these various\r\nrelations, conditions, and situations, as they are crowded within the\r\nfew years of his public ministry, he sustains the same consistent\r\ncharacter throughout, without ever exposing himself to censure. He\r\nfulfils every duty to God, to man, and to himself, without a single\r\nviolation of duty, and exhibits an entire conformity to the law, in the\r\nspirit as well as the letter. His life is one unbroken service of God,\r\nin active and passive obedience to His holy will--one grand act of\r\nabsolute love to God and love to man, of personal self-consecration to\r\nthe glory of his Heavenly Father and the salvation of a fallen race. In\r\nthe language of the people who were 'beyond measure astonished at his\r\nworks,' we must say, the more we study his life: 'He did all things\r\nwell.' In a solemn appeal to his Heavenly Father in the parting hour, he\r\ncould proclaim to the world that he had glorified him in the earth, and\r\nfinished the work he gave him to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNITY OF VIRTUE AND PIETY.\r\n\r\nThe first feature in this singular perfection of Christ's character\r\nwhich strikes our attention, is the perfect harmony of virtue and piety,\r\nof morality and religion, or of love to God and love to man. He is more\r\nthan moral, and more than pious; he is holy in the strict and full sense\r\nof the word. There is a divine beauty and perfection in his character,\r\nthe mere contemplation of which brings purity, brightness, peace, and\r\nbliss to the soul.\r\n\r\nPiety was the soul of his morality, and lifted it far above the sphere\r\nof legality or conformity to law. Every moral action in him proceeded\r\nfrom supreme love to God, and looked to the temporal and eternal\r\nwelfare of man. The groundwork of his character was the most intimate\r\nand uninterrupted union and communion with his Heavenly Father, from\r\nwhom he derived, to whom he referred, everything. Already in his twelfth\r\nyear he found his life element and delight in the things of his Father.\r\nIt was his daily food to do the will of Him that sent him, and to finish\r\nhis work. To Him he looked in prayer before every important act, and\r\ntaught his disciples that model prayer which, for simplicity, brevity,\r\ncomprehensiveness, and suitableness, can never be surpassed. He often\r\nretired to a mountain or solitary place for prayer, and spent days and\r\nnights in this blessed privilege. But so constant and uniform was his\r\nhabit of communion with the great Jehovah, that he kept it up amid the\r\nmultitude, and converted the crowded city into a religious retreat. His\r\nself-consciousness was at every moment conditioned, animated, and\r\nimpregnated by the consciousness of God. Even when he exclaimed, in\r\nindescribable anguish of body and soul, and in vicarious sympathy with\r\nthe misery of the whole race: 'My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken\r\nme!' the bond of union was not broken, or even loosened, but simply\r\nobscured for a moment, as the sun by a passing cloud, and the enjoyment,\r\nnot the possession of it, was withdrawn from his feelings; for\r\nimmediately afterward he commended his soul into the hands of his\r\nFather, and triumphantly exclaimed: 'It is finished!' So strong and\r\ncomplete was this moral union of Christ with God at every moment of his\r\nlife, that he fully realized for the first time the idea of religion,\r\nwhose object is to bring about such a union, and that he is the personal\r\nrepresentative and living embodiment of Christianity as the true and\r\nabsolute religion.\r\n\r\nWith all this, the piety of Christ was no inactive contemplation, or\r\nretiring mysticism and selfish enjoyment; but thoroughly practical, ever\r\nactive in works of charity, and tending to regenerate and transform the\r\nworld into the kingdom of God. 'He went about doing good.' His life is\r\nan unbroken series of good works and virtues in active exercise, all\r\nproceeding from the same union with God, animated by the same love, and\r\ntending to the same end, the glory of God and the happiness of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLETENESS AND UNIVERSALITY OF HIS CHARACTER.\r\n\r\nThe next feature we would notice, is the completeness or pleromatic\r\nfulness of the moral and religious character of Christ. While all other\r\nmen represent at best but broken fragments of the idea of goodness and\r\nholiness, he exhausts the list of virtues and graces which may be named.\r\nHis soul is a moral paradise full of charming flowers, shining in every\r\nvariety of color, under the blue dome of the skies, drinking in the\r\nrefreshing dews of heaven and the warming beams of the sun, sending its\r\nsweet fragrance around, and filling the beholder with rapturous delight.\r\n\r\nHistory exhibits to us many men of commanding and comprehensive genius,\r\nwho stand at the head of their age and nation, and furnish material for\r\nthe intellectual activity of whole generations and periods, until they\r\nare succeeded by other heroes at a new epoch of development. As rivers\r\ngenerally spring from high mountains, so knowledge and moral power rises\r\nand is ever nourished from the heights of humanity. Abraham, the father\r\nof the faithful; Moses, the lawgiver of the Jewish theocracy; Elijah,\r\namong the prophets; Peter, Paul, and John among the apostles; Athanasius\r\nand Chrysostom among the Greek, Augustine and Jerome among the Latin\r\nfathers; Thomas Aquinas and Duns Scotus among the schoolmen; Leo I. and\r\nGregory VII. among the popes; Luther and Calvin in the line of\r\nProtestant reformers and divines; Socrates, the patriarch of the\r\nancient schools of philosophy; Homer, Dante, Shakspeare, and Milton,\r\nGöthe and Schiller in the history of poetry, among the various nations\r\nto which they belong; Raphael among painters; Charlemagne, the first and\r\ngreatest in the long succession of German emperors; Napoleon, towering\r\nhigh above all the generals of his training; Washington, the wisest and\r\nbest as well as the first of American presidents, and the purest and\r\nnoblest type of the American character, may be mentioned as examples of\r\nthose representative heroes in history who anticipate and concentrate\r\nthe powers of whole generations. But they never represent universal, but\r\nonly sectional humanity; they are identified with a particular people or\r\nage, and partake of its errors, superstitions, and failings, almost in\r\nthe same proportion in which they exhibit its virtues. Moses, though\r\nrevered by the followers of three religions, was a Jew in views,\r\nfeelings, habits, and position, as well as by parentage; Socrates never\r\nrose above the Greek type of character; Luther was a German in all his\r\nvirtues and faults, and can only be properly understood as a German;\r\nCalvin, though an exile from his native land, remained a Frenchman; and\r\nWashington can be to no nation on earth what he is to the American.\r\nTheir influence may and does extend far beyond their respective national\r\nhorizons, yet they can never furnish a universal model for imitation. We\r\nregard them as extraordinary but fallible and imperfect men, whom it\r\nwould be very unsafe to follow in every view and line of conduct. Very\r\nfrequently the failings and vices of great men are in proportion to\r\ntheir virtues and powers, as the tallest bodies cast the longest\r\nshadows. Even the three leading apostles are models of piety and virtue\r\nonly as far as they reflect the image of their Heavenly Master, and it\r\nis only with this limitation that Paul exhorts his spiritual children:\r\n'Be ye followers of me even as I am also of Christ.'\r\n\r\nWhat these representative men are to particular ages or nations, or\r\nsects or particular schools of science and art, Christ was to the human\r\nfamily at large in its relation to God. He and he alone is the universal\r\ntype for universal imitation. Hence he could, without the least\r\nimpropriety, or suspicion of vanity, call upon all men to forsake all\r\nthings and to follow him. He stands above the limitations of age,\r\nschool, sect, nation, and race. Although a Jew according to the flesh,\r\nthere is nothing Jewish about him which is not at the same time of\r\ngeneral significance. The particular and national in him is always duly\r\nsubordinated to the general and human. Still less was he ever identified\r\nwith a party or sect. He was equally removed from the stiff formalism of\r\nthe Pharisees, the loose liberalism of the Sadducees, and the inactive\r\nmysticism of the Essenes. He rose above all the prejudices, bigotries,\r\nand superstitions of his age and people, which exert their power even\r\nupon the strongest and otherwise most liberal minds.\r\n\r\nWitness his freedom in the observance of the Sabbath, by which he\r\noffended the scrupulous literalists, while he fulfilled, as the Lord of\r\nthe Sabbath, the true spirit of the law in its universal and abiding\r\nsignificance; his reply to the disciples, when they traced the\r\nmisfortune of the blind man to a particular sin of the subject or his\r\nparents; his liberal conduct toward the Samaritans, as contrasted with\r\nthe inveterate hatred and prejudices of the Jews, including his own\r\ndisciples at the time; and his charitable judgment of the slaughtered\r\nGalileans whose blood Pilate had mingled with their sacrifices, and the\r\neighteen upon whom the tower in Siloam fell and slew them. 'Think ye,'\r\nhe addressed the children of superstition, 'that these men were sinners\r\nabove all the Galileans, and above all men that dwelt in Jerusalem,\r\nbecause they suffered such things? I tell you, nay: but except ye\r\nrepent, ye shall all likewise perish.'\r\n\r\nAll the words and all the actions of Christ, while they were fully\r\nadapted to the occasions which called them forth, retain their force and\r\napplicability undiminished to all ages and nations. He is the same\r\nunsurpassed and unsurpassable model of every virtue to the Christians of\r\nevery generation, every clime, every sect, every nation, and every race.\r\n\r\n\r\nHARMONY OF ALL GRACES AND VIRTUES.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that a complete catalogue of virtues would do\r\njustice to the character under consideration. It is not only the\r\ncompleteness, but still more the even proportion and perfect harmony of\r\nvirtues and graces apparently opposite and contradictory, which\r\ndistinguishes him specifically from all other men. This feature has\r\nstruck with singular force all the more eminent writers on the subject.\r\nIt gives the finish to that beauty of holiness which is the sublimest\r\npicture presented to our contemplation.\r\n\r\nHe was free from all one-sidedness, which constitutes the weakness as\r\nwell as the strength of the most eminent men. He was not a man of one\r\nidea, nor of one virtue, towering above all the rest. The moral forces\r\nwere so well tempered and moderated by each other, that none was unduly\r\nprominent, none carried to excess, none alloyed by the kindred failing.\r\nEach was checked and completed by the opposite grace. His character\r\nnever lost its even balance and happy equilibrium, never needed\r\nmodification or re-adjustment. It was thoroughly sound, and uniformly\r\nconsistent from the beginning to the end.\r\n\r\nWe cannot properly attribute to him any one temperament. He was neither\r\nsanguine, like Peter, nor choleric, like Paul, nor melancholy, like\r\nJohn, nor phlegmatic, as James is sometimes, though incorrectly,\r\nrepresented to have been; but he combined the vivacity without the\r\nlevity of the sanguine, the vigor without the violence of the choleric,\r\nthe seriousness without the austerity of the melancholic, the calmness\r\nwithout the apathy of the phlegmatic temperament.\r\n\r\nHe was equally far removed from the excesses of the legalist, the\r\npietist, the ascetic, and the enthusiast. With the strictest obedience\r\nto the law, he moved in the element of freedom; with all the fervor of\r\nthe enthusiast, he was always calm, sober, and self-possessed;\r\nnotwithstanding his complete and uniform elevation above the affairs of\r\nthis world, he freely mingled with society, male and female, dined with\r\npublicans and sinners, sat at the wedding feast, shed tears at the\r\nsepulchre, delighted in God's nature, admired the beauties of the\r\nlilies, and used the occupations of the husbandman for the illustration\r\nof the sublimest truths of the kingdom of heaven. His virtue was\r\nhealthy, manly, vigorous, yet genial, social, and truly human, never\r\naustere and repulsive, always in full sympathy with innocent joy and\r\npleasure. He, the purest and holiest of men, provided wine for the\r\nwedding feast, introduced the fatted calf and music and dancing into the\r\npicture of welcome of the prodigal son to his father's house, and even\r\nprovoked the sneer of his adversaries that he 'came eating and\r\ndrinking,' and was a 'glutton' and a 'winebibber.'\r\n\r\nHis zeal never degenerated into passion or rashness, his constancy into\r\nobstinacy, his benevolence into weakness, nor his tenderness into\r\nsentimentality. His unworldliness was free from indifference and\r\nunsociability, his dignity from pride and presumption, his affability\r\nfrom undue familiarity, his self-denial from moroseness, his temperance\r\nfrom austerity. He combined child-like innocence with manly strength,\r\nall-absorbing devotion to God with untiring interest in the welfare of\r\nman, tender love to the sinner with uncompromising severity against\r\nsin, commanding dignity with winning humility, fearless courage with\r\nwise caution, unyielding firmness with sweet gentleness.\r\n\r\nHe is justly compared with the lion in strength and with the lamb in\r\nmeekness. He equally possessed the wisdom of the serpent and the\r\nsimplicity of the dove. He brought both the sword against every form of\r\nwickedness, and the peace which the world cannot give. He was the most\r\neffective, and yet the least noisy, the most radical, and yet the most\r\nconservative, calm, and patient of all reformers. He came to fulfil\r\nevery letter of the law, and yet he made all things new. The same hand\r\nwhich drove the profane traffickers from the temple, blessed little\r\nchildren, healed the lepers, and rescued the sinking disciple; the same\r\near which heard the voice of approbation from heaven was open to the\r\ncries of the woman in travail; the same mouth which pronounced the\r\nterrible woe on hypocrites and condemned the impure desire and unkind\r\nfeeling as well as the open crime, blessed the poor in spirit, announced\r\npardon to the adulteress, and prayed for his murderers; the same eye\r\nwhich beheld the mysteries of God and penetrated the heart of man shed\r\ntears of compassion over ungrateful Jerusalem, and tears of friendship\r\nat the grave of Lazarus.\r\n\r\nThese are indeed opposite, yet not contradictory traits of character, as\r\nlittle as the different manifestations of God's power and goodness in\r\nthe tempest and the sunshine, in the towering alps and the lily of the\r\nvalley, in the boundless ocean and the dewdrop of the morning. They are\r\nseparated in imperfect men, indeed, but united in Christ, the universal\r\nmodel for all.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRIST'S PASSION.\r\n\r\nFinally, as all active virtues meet in him, so he unites the active or\r\nheroic virtues with the passive and gentle. He is equally the highest\r\nstandard of all true martyrdom.\r\n\r\nNo character can become complete without trial and suffering, and a\r\nnoble death is the crowning act of a noble life. Edmund Burke said to\r\nFox, in the English Parliament: 'Obloquy is a necessary ingredient of\r\nall true glory. Calumny and abuse are essential parts of triumph.' The\r\nancient Greeks and Romans admired a good man struggling with misfortune\r\nas a sight worthy of the gods. Plato describes the righteous man as one\r\nwho, without doing any injustice, yet has the appearance of the greatest\r\ninjustice, and proves his own justice by perseverance against all\r\ncalumny unto death; yea, he predicts that if such a righteous man should\r\never appear, he would be 'scourged, tortured, bound, deprived of his\r\nsight, and, after having suffered all possible injury, nailed on a\r\npost.' No wonder that the ancient fathers saw in this remarkable passage\r\nan unconscious prophecy of Christ. But how far is this ideal of the\r\ngreat philosopher from the actual reality, as it appeared three hundred\r\nyears afterward! The great men of this world, who rise even above\r\nthemselves on inspiring occasions, and boldly face a superior army, are\r\noften thrown off their equilibrium in ordinary life, and grow impatient\r\nat trifling obstacles. Only think of Napoleon at the head of his\r\nconquering legions and at the helm of an empire, and the same Napoleon\r\nafter the defeat at Waterloo and on the island of St. Helena. The\r\nhighest form of passive virtue attained by ancient heathenism or modern\r\nsecular heroism is that stoicism which meets and overcomes the trials\r\nand misfortunes of life in the spirit of haughty contempt and unfeeling\r\nindifference, which destroys the sensibilities, and is but another\r\nexhibition of selfishness and pride.\r\n\r\nChrist has set up a far higher standard by his teaching, and example,\r\nnever known before or since, except in imperfect imitation of him. He\r\nhas revolutionized moral philosophy, and convinced the world that\r\nforgiving love to the enemy, holiness and humility, gentle patience in\r\nsuffering, and cheerful submission to the holy will of God is the\r\ncrowning excellency of moral greatness. 'If thy brother,' he says,\r\n'trespass against thee seven times in a day, and seven times in a day\r\nturn again to thee, saying, I repent; thou shalt forgive him.' 'Love\r\nyour enemies, bless them that curse you, do good to them that hate you,\r\nand pray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you.' This is\r\na sublime maxim, truly, but still more sublime is its actual exhibition\r\nin his life.\r\n\r\nChrist's passive virtue is not confined to the closing scenes of his\r\nministry. As human life is beset at every step by trials, vexations, and\r\nhindrances, which should serve the educational purpose of developing its\r\nresources and proving its strength, so was Christ's. During the whole\r\nstate of his humiliation he was 'a man of sorrows and acquainted with\r\ngrief,' and had to endure 'the contradiction of sinners.' He was poor,\r\nand suffered hunger and fatigue. He was tempted by the devil. His path\r\nwas obstructed with apparently insurmountable difficulties from the\r\noutset. His words and miracles called forth the bitter hatred of the\r\nworld, which resulted at last in the bloody counsel of death. The\r\nPharisees and Sadducees forgot their jealousies and quarrels in opposing\r\nhim. They rejected and perverted his testimony; they laid snares for him\r\nby insidious questions; they called him a glutton and a winebibber for\r\neating and drinking like other men, a friend of publicans and sinners\r\nfor his condescending love and mercy, a sabbath breaker for doing good\r\non the sabbath day; they charged him with madness and blasphemy for\r\nasserting his unity with the Father, and derived his miracles from\r\nBeelzebub, the prince of devils. The common people, though astonished at\r\nhis wisdom and mighty works, pointed sneeringly at his origin; his own\r\ncountry and native town refused him the honor of a prophet. Even his\r\nbrothers, we are told, did not believe in him, and in their impatient\r\nzeal for a temporal kingdom, they found fault with his unostentatious\r\nproceeding. His apostles and disciples, with all their profound\r\nreverence for his character and faith in his divine origin and mission\r\nas the Messiah, of God, yet by their ignorance, their carnal Jewish\r\nnotions, and their almost habitual misunderstanding of his spiritual\r\ndiscourses, must have constituted a severe trial of patience to a\r\nteacher of far less superiority to his pupils.\r\n\r\nTo all this must be added the constant sufferings from sympathy with\r\nhuman misery as it met him in ten thousand forms at every step. What a\r\ntrial for him, the purest, gentlest, most tender hearted, to breath more\r\nthan thirty years the foul atmosphere of this fallen world, to see the\r\nconstant outbursts of sinful passions, to hear the great wail of\r\nhumanity borne to his ear upon the four winds of heaven, to be brought\r\ninto personal contact with the blind, the lame, the deaf, the paralytic,\r\nthe lunatic, the possessed, the dead, and to be assaulted, as it were,\r\nby the concentrated force of sickness, sorrow, grief, and agony!\r\n\r\nBut how shall we describe his passion, more properly so called, with\r\nwhich no other suffering can be compared for a moment! There is a lonely\r\ngrandeur in it, foreshadowed in the word of the prophet; 'I have trodden\r\nthe winepress alone, and of the people there was none with me.' If great\r\nmen occupy a solitary position, far above the ordinary level, on the\r\nsublime heights of thought or action, how much more then Jesus in his\r\nsufferings; he, the purest and holiest of beings! The nearer a man\r\napproaches to moral perfection, the deeper are his sensibilities, the\r\nkeener his sense of sin and evil and sorrow in this wicked world. Never\r\ndid any man suffer more innocently, more unjustly, more intensely, than\r\nJesus of Nazareth. Within the narrow limits of a few hours we have here\r\na tragedy of universal significance, exhibiting every form of human\r\nweakness and infernal wickedness, of ingratitude, desertion, injury, and\r\ninsult, of bodily and mental pain and anguish, culminating in the most\r\nignominious death then known among the Jews and Gentiles, the death of a\r\nmalefactor and a slave. The government and the people combined against\r\nhim who came to save them. His own disciples forsook him; Peter denied\r\nhim; Judas, under the inspiration of the devil, betrayed him. The rulers\r\nof the nation condemned him, rude soldiers mocked him, the furious mob\r\ncried: 'Crucify him!' He was seized in the night, hurried from tribunal\r\nto tribunal, arrayed in a crown of thorns, insulted, smitten, scourged,\r\nspit upon, and hung like a criminal and a slave between two robbers and\r\nmurderers!\r\n\r\nHow did Christ bear all these little and great trials of life, and the\r\ndeath on the cross?\r\n\r\nLet us remember first, that, unlike the icy stoics in their unnatural\r\nand repulsive pseudo-virtue, he had the keenest sensibilities and the\r\ndeepest sympathies with all human grief, that made him even shed tears\r\nat the grave of a friend and in the agony of the garden, and provide a\r\nrefuge for his mother in the last dying hour. But with this truly human\r\ntenderness and delicacy of feeling, he ever combined an unutterable\r\ndignity and majesty, a sublime self-control and imperturbable calmness\r\nof mind. There is a solitary grandeur and majesty in his deepest\r\nsufferings, which forbids a feeling of pity and compassion on our side\r\nas incompatible with the admiration and reverence for his character. We\r\nfeel the force of his words to the women of Jerusalem, when they\r\nbewailed him on the way to Cavalry: 'Weep not for me, but weep for\r\nyourselves and your children.' We never hear him break out in angry\r\npassion and violence, although he was at war with the whole ungodly\r\nworld. He clearly and fully foresaw and repeatedly foretold his\r\nsufferings to his disciples.\r\n\r\nAnd yet never murmured, never uttered discontent, displeasure, or\r\nresentment. He was never disheartened, discouraged, ruffled, or fretted,\r\nbut full of unbounded confidence that all was well ordered in the\r\nprovidence of his Heavenly Father. His calmness in the tempest on the\r\nlake, when his disciples were trembling on the brink of destruction and\r\ndespair, is an illustration of his heavenly frame of mind. All his works\r\nwere performed with a quiet dignity and ease that contrasts most\r\nstrikingly with the surrounding commotion and excitement. He never asked\r\nthe favor, or heard the applause, or feared the threat of the world. He\r\nmoved serenely like the sun above the clouds of human passions and\r\ntrials and commotions, as they sailed under him. He was ever surrounded\r\nby the element of peace, even in his parting hour in that dark and\r\nsolemn night, when he said to his disturbed disciples: 'Peace I leave\r\nwith you, my peace I give unto you: not as the world giveth, give I unto\r\nyou. Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid.' He was\r\nnever what we call unhappy, but full of inward joy, which he bequeathed\r\nto his disciples in that sublimest of all prayers, 'that they might have\r\nhis joy fulfilled in themselves.' With all his severe rebuke to the\r\nPharisees, he never indulged in personalities. He ever returned good for\r\nevil. He forgave Peter for his denial, and would have forgiven Judas, if\r\nin the exercise of sincere repentance he had sought his pardon. Even\r\nwhile hanging on the cross, he had only the language of pity for the\r\nwretches who were driving the nails into his hands and feet, and prayed\r\nin their behalf: 'Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.'\r\nHe did not seek or hasten his martyrdom, like many of the early martyrs\r\nof the Ignatian type, in their morbid enthusiasm and ambitious humility,\r\nbut quietly and patiently waited for the hour appointed by the will of\r\nhis Heavenly Father.\r\n\r\nBut when the hour came, with what self-possession and calmness, with\r\nwhat strength and meekness, with what majesty and gentleness did he pass\r\nthrough its dark and trying scenes! A prisoner before Pilate, who\r\nrepresented the power of the Roman empire, he professes himself a king\r\nof truth, and makes the governor tremble before him. Charged with crime\r\nat the tribunal of the high priest, he speaks to him with the majesty\r\nand dignity of the judge of the world. And in the agony of death on the\r\ncross he dispenses a place in paradise to the penitent robber. In the\r\nhistory of the passion, every word and act are unutterably significant,\r\nfrom the agony in Gethsemane, when, overwhelmed with the sympathetic\r\nsense of the entire guilt of mankind, and in full view of the terrible\r\nscenes before him--the only guiltless being in the world--he prayed that\r\nthe cup might pass from him, but immediately added, 'Not my but thy will\r\nbe done,' to the triumphant exclamation on the cross, 'It is finished!'\r\nEven his dignified silence before the tribunal of his enemies and the\r\nfurious mob, when 'as a lamb dumb before his shearers he opened not his\r\nmouth,' is more eloquent than any apology. Who will venture to bring a\r\nparallel from the annals of ancient or modern sages, when even a\r\nRousseau confessed: 'If Socrates suffered and died like a philosopher,\r\nChrist suffered and died like a God!' The passion and crucifixion of\r\nJesus, like his whole character, stands without a parallel, solitary and\r\nalone in its glory, and will ever continue to be what it has been for\r\nthese eighteen hundred years, the most sacred theme of meditation, the\r\nhighest exemplar of suffering virtue, the strongest weapon against sin\r\nand Satan, the deepest source of comfort to the noblest and best of men.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY--CHRIST'S CHARACTER THE GREATEST MORAL MIRACLE IN HISTORY.\r\n\r\nSuch was Jesus of Nazareth--a true man in body, soul, and spirit, yet\r\ndiffering from all men, a character absolutely unique and original, from\r\ntender childhood to ripe manhood moving in unbroken union with God,\r\noverflowing with the purest love to man, free from every sin and error,\r\ninnocent and holy, teaching and practising all virtues in perfect\r\nharmony, devoted solely and uniformly to the noblest ends, sealing the\r\npurest life with the sublimest death, and ever acknowledged since as the\r\none and only perfect model of goodness and holiness! All human greatness\r\nloses on closer inspection; but Christ's character grows more and more\r\npure, sacred, and lovely, the better we know him.\r\n\r\nNo biographer, moralist, or artist can be satisfied with any attempt of\r\nhis to set it forth. It is felt to be infinitely greater than any\r\nconception or representation of it by the mind, the tongue, and the\r\npencil of man or angel. We might as well attempt to empty the waters of\r\nthe boundless sea into a narrow well, or to portray the splendor of the\r\nrisen sun and the starry heavens with ink. No picture of the Saviour,\r\nthough drawn by the master hand of a Raphael or Dürer or Rubens--no\r\nepic, though conceived by the genius of a Dante or Milton or Klopstock,\r\ncan improve on the artless narrative of the gospel, whose only but\r\nall-powerful charm is truth. In this case certainly truth is stranger\r\nand stronger than fiction, and speaks best itself without comment,\r\nexplanation, and eulogy. Here and here alone the highest perfection of\r\nart falls short of the historical fact, and fancy finds no room for\r\nidealizing the real. For here we have the absolute ideal itself in\r\nliving reality. It seems to me that this consideration alone should\r\nsatisfy the reflecting mind that Christ's character, though truly\r\nnatural and human, must be at the same time truly supernatural and\r\ndivine.\r\n\r\nEven Göthe, the most universal and finished, but at the same time the\r\nmost intensely worldly of all modern poets, calls Christ 'the Divine\r\nMan,' the 'Holy One,' and represents him as the pattern and model of\r\nhumanity. Thomas Carlyle, the great hero-worshipper, found no equal in\r\nall the range of ancient and modern heroism; he calls his life a\r\n'perfect ideal poem,' and his person 'the greatest of all heroes,' whom\r\nhe does not name, leaving 'sacred silence to meditate that sacred\r\nmatter.' And Ernest Renan, the celebrated French orientalist and critic,\r\nwho views Jesus from the standpoint of a pantheistic naturalism, and\r\nexpels all miracles from the gospel history, calls him 'the incomparable\r\nman, to whom the universal conscience has decreed the title of _Son of\r\nGod_, and that with justice, since he caused religion to take a step in\r\nadvance incomparably greater than any other in the past, and probably\r\nthan _any yet to come_;' and he closes his 'Life of Jesus' with the\r\nremarkable concession: 'Whatever may be the surprises of the future,\r\n_Jesus will never be surpassed_. His worship will grow young without\r\nceasing; his legend will call forth tears without end; his sufferings\r\nwill melt the noblest hearts; all ages will proclaim that among the sons\r\nof men there is none born greater than Jesus.'\r\n\r\nThe whole range of history and fiction furnishes no parallel to such a\r\ncharacter. There never was anything even approaching to it before or\r\nsince, except in faint imitation of his example. It cannot be explained\r\non purely human principles, nor derived from any intellectual and moral\r\nforces of the age in which he lived. On the contrary, it stands in\r\nmarked contrast to the whole surrounding world of Judaism and\r\nheathenism, which present to us the dreary picture of internal decay,\r\nand which actually crumbled into ruin before the new moral creation of\r\nthe crucified Jesus of Nazareth. He is the one absolute and\r\nunaccountable exception to the universal experience of mankind. He is\r\nthe great central miracle of the whole gospel history, and all his\r\nmiracles are but the natural and necessary manifestations of his\r\nmiraculous person, performed with the same ease with which we perform\r\nour ordinary daily works.\r\n\r\nIn vain has infidelity, in ever-changing shapes and forms, assailed the\r\neverlasting foundation of this greatest and sublimest character that\r\never blessed or will bless the earth. He arises brighter and stronger\r\nfrom every fiery ordeal of criticism, and stands out to every beholder\r\nas the greatest benefactor of the race and the only Saviour from sin and\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nYes! he still lives, the Divine Man and incarnate God, on the ever fresh\r\nand self-authenticating record of the Gospels, in the unbroken history\r\nof eighteen centuries, and in the hearts and lives of the wisest and\r\nbest of our race. Jesus Christ is the most certain, the most sacred, and\r\nthe most glorious of all facts, arrayed in a beauty and majesty which\r\nthrows the 'starry heavens above us and the moral law within us' into\r\nobscurity, and fills us truly with ever-growing reverence and awe. He\r\nshines forth with the self-evidencing light of the noonday sun. He is\r\ntoo great, too pure, too perfect to have been invented by any sinful and\r\nerring man. His character and claims are confirmed by the sublimest\r\ndoctrine, the purest ethics, the mightiest miracles, the grandest\r\nspiritual kingdom, and are daily and hourly exhibited in the virtues and\r\ngraces of all who yield to the regenerating and sanctifying power of his\r\nspirit and example. The historical Christ meets and satisfies our\r\ndeepest intellectual and moral wants. Our souls, if left to their\r\nnoblest impulses and aspirations, instinctively turn to him as the\r\nneedle to the magnet, as the flower to the sun, as the panting hart to\r\nthe fresh fountain. We are made for him, and 'our heart is without rest\r\nuntil it rests in him.' He commands our assent, he wins our admiration,\r\nhe overwhelms us to humble adoration and worship. We cannot look upon\r\nhim without spiritual benefit. We cannot think of him without being\r\nelevated above all that is low and mean, and encouraged to all that is\r\ngood and noble. The very hem of his garment is healing to the touch; one\r\nhour spent in his communion outweighs all the pleasures of sin. He is\r\nthe most precious and indispensable gift of a merciful God to a fallen\r\nworld. In him are the treasures of true wisdom, in him the fountain of\r\npardon and peace, in him the only substantial hope and comfort of this\r\nworld and that which is to come. Mankind could better afford to lose the\r\nwhole literature of Greece and Rome, of Germany and France, of England\r\nand America, than the story of Jesus of Nazareth. Without him, history\r\nis a dreary waste, an inextricable enigma, a chaos of facts without\r\nmeaning, connection, and aim; with him it is a beautiful, harmonious\r\nrevelation, the slow but sure unfolding of a plan of infinite wisdom and\r\nlove: all ancient history converging to his coming, all modern history\r\nreceiving from him his higher life and impulse. He is the glory of the\r\npast, the life of the present, the hope of the future. We cannot even\r\nunderstand ourselves without him. According to an old Jewish proverb:\r\n'The secret of man is the secret of the Messiah.' He is the great\r\ncentral light of history as a whole, and at the same time the light of\r\nevery soul; he alone can solve the mystery of our being, and fulfil our\r\nintellectual desires after truth, all our moral aspirations after\r\ngoodness and holiness, and the longing of our feelings after peace and\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nNot for all the wealth and wisdom of this world would I weaken the faith\r\nof the humblest Christian in his Divine Lord and Saviour; but if, by the\r\ngrace of God, I could convert a single sceptic to a child-like faith in\r\nhim, who lived and died for me and for all, I would feel that I had not\r\nlived in vain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPHORISMS.--NO. XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n'Men,' saith my Lord Bacon, 'think to govern words by their own reason:\r\nbut it also happens that words throw back their force upon the\r\nunderstanding;' and thus, we may justly add, often distort our thoughts,\r\nand lead us to very erroneous conclusions.\r\n\r\nThis is apparently the case with the word _motive_, in speaking of human\r\nvolitions. A motive power in mechanics is one that produces motion; and\r\nhence the application of the word to the occasion or reason of any\r\nparticular act of choice, with the all but inevitable fallacy of\r\nconfounding the idea of a mechanical force with that of an influence\r\nupon the mind. That there is some analogy must be admitted; but that\r\nthere is such similarity as is often assumed, we are obliged to deny.\r\nThe almost total difference between a mechanical power and a thought or\r\ndesire--between a material and spiritual subject of operation--is too\r\napt to be left out of the account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCHES OF AMERICAN LIFE AND SCENERY.\r\n\r\nVI.--TO SARANAC AND BACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew indeed are the pleasures that can be compared with the keen\r\nenjoyment of travel in a new and beautiful country, where every sense is\r\nstimulated by the purest and most aromatic of atmospheres, and where\r\nrocks, trees, rivers, lakes, and skies offer every possibility of\r\ncombination imaginable under the structural conditions of the region.\r\nThe life of the scout and the pioneer is a constant succession of\r\npleasant surprises and unanticipated adventure; every hilltop promises a\r\nnew picture, every dawn and sunset an additional novelty for that\r\ngallery, longer than the Louvre, and fuller than the Vatican, of which\r\nmemory holds the key and is sole warden. Hardship and even danger are\r\nenclosed in surroundings so beautiful, so fresh and invigorating, that\r\nthey seem only to add zest to the pursuit, to give dignity and\r\nsignificance to an occupation which might perhaps otherwise be\r\nstigmatized as mere selfish vagabondage. Oh, the freedom of the wild\r\nwoods! the rest to the soul of the shadowy forest and flower-strewn\r\nturf! The wind may toss the locks, the sun brown the skin, and the\r\nbrambles tear the garments, but there are none to cavil, none to count\r\nthe gray hairs or the freckles, or see that said garments are of last\r\nyear's fashioning. If the eyes look kindly, the peering squirrels will\r\nbe content, and if the voice be gentle, the birds will ask no more,\r\nexcept, perhaps, a crumb or two from the slender stock of woodsman's\r\nfare. The deer and the trout will not question our philosophy, knowing\r\ninstinctively, as we do, that there is a great God who made us all, and\r\nwho ever encompasseth us with a love surpassing every created\r\nconception. They will only ask of our good will, and that our absolute\r\nneed be the limit of our tax upon their lives. With the sky for roof,\r\nand the beech and the pine for friends and teachers, the body has time\r\nto strengthen, and the conscience and inner self to grow steadily\r\nupright, that they may overtop trifles, rise to the height of heavenly\r\ninspirations, and hence win power to withstand the surging floods of\r\nbewildering human passion. When men meet such souls, they are amazed at\r\ntheir calmness and simplicity, and dimly guess that the All-Powerful,\r\nthrough His created universe, has been whispering to them secrets of\r\nstrength, perseverance, patience, and charity.\r\n\r\nBut this subject is boundless as its origin, and we must now to the\r\nparticulars of a personal experience, which, if limited, may yet be of\r\nservice to others desirous of journeying in the same region.\r\n\r\nHaving made a thorough acquaintance with the environs of Elizabethtown,\r\nElsie and I could no longer resist the blandishment of the blue\r\nmountains ever beckoning us westward through the rocky portal of the\r\nKeene Pass. July 13th, at six A.M., we started in the weekly stage for\r\nSaranac, thirty-six miles distant. The morning was bright; a few low\r\nclouds hung about the tops of the higher hills, and the wind blew from\r\nthe east, a direction which here, contrary to our experience near the\r\nseaboard, by no means implies rain. So great is the distance of the\r\nAdirondac plateau from the sea, so numerous its ranges, and so great the\r\nelevation of the ridges lying between it and the ocean, that we found\r\nour ordinary weather calculations all come to nought, east winds blowing\r\nfor days without a drop of rain, and western breezes bringing clouds\r\nand moisture.\r\n\r\nThe road to Keene winds along a branch of the Boquet River, on which are\r\none or two quite pretty falls, with consequent mills; it ascends\r\ncontinually until it reaches the foot of the steep rocks forming the\r\nKeene Pass. The views back over the Boquet Valley and toward the Green\r\nMountains of Vermont are very lovely, and those obtained in descending\r\nthe western slope of this, the Boquet range, are magnificent. Soon left\r\nbehind are the high cliffs and the steep slide, where a gathering\r\navalanche of rocks and earth swept through a forest, carrying off a\r\ngreat belt of timber, wherewith to strew the little valley, and block\r\nthe road and stream below. The rugged mountains on either hand have been\r\nburnt over, and send up into the blue ether bare, white, foot-enticing\r\npeaks. At the base of the western declivity lies the valley of the East\r\nBranch of the Au Sable, and beyond, the great Adirondac range,\r\novertopped by Whiteface and Mount Tahawus. We greeted these giants with\r\ndue reverence, hoping for a nearer acquaintance, for only their extreme\r\nsummits are visible from that point, Whiteface bold and peaked, Tahawus\r\nround and indistinct. The great ridge, hiding all but their heads, is\r\nhere jagged or flowing, steep, and dark with spruce and pine. It rises\r\nlike an impassable wall; of a clear morning, a frowning barrier of\r\ngranite and forest; of a hazy afternoon, the shining, glowing rampart of\r\nsome celestial city.\r\n\r\nThe village of Keene is a straggling collection of dwellings, with an\r\ninn, a post office, and a store or two. It lies in the intervale\r\nbordering the East Branch of the Au Sable, and is twelve miles from\r\nElizabethtown.\r\n\r\nThus far, our only fellow traveller had been a school girl, going home\r\nfor the summer vacation. At Keene our number was increased by the\r\naddition of another damsel, with accompaniment of two hounds, Spart and\r\nPrince, bound for Saranac. When first fastened behind the open wagon\r\n(our stage), they began a vigorous quarrel, which struck us very much as\r\na matrimonial squabble, both tied, and neither having a fair chance for\r\na free fight. Our driver, an excellent specimen of the upright and\r\nintelligent man of Northern New York, cracked his whip, increased the\r\nexisting merriment by calling out, 'Wal, dogs, hev ye done fightin'?'\r\nand started up the long declivity leading over the Adirondac range,\r\nthrough Pitch-off Mountain (another pass), to the plains of North Elba.\r\nThe hill is a long one, the cliffs of the mountain pass exceedingly\r\npicturesque, and the black tarn under the beetling crags suggestive of\r\nPoe's 'House of Usher.' Long, however, ere we reached this point, Spart\r\nhad gnawed through his rope, and was trotting beside the wagon. Our\r\ndriver vainly endeavored to refasten him. Although mild of visage, and\r\napparently good-natured, he showed so formidable a set of teeth, that it\r\nwas thought prudent to desist, and trust to his following his companion,\r\nwho still trotted along, coughing and choking, and almost stifled by our\r\nown dust, blown after us by the east wind. After this attempt, Spart\r\nevidently played shy of our whole party, and, having raced ahead during\r\na few miles, finally disappeared in the woods, probably attracted by the\r\nscent of game.\r\n\r\nWe reached North Elba (twelve miles from Keene) about noon, and there\r\nstopped to dine at Scott's, a place widely and favorably known to\r\ntravellers in that section of country. Round the plain of North Elba\r\ntower the very highest peaks of the Adirondacs; Tahawus (Marcy), Golden,\r\nMcIntire, and the beautiful gateway of the Indian Pass to the south, and\r\nto the north the scarred sides of Whiteface and the bold forms of the\r\nmountains bordering the Wilmington notch. Descending the plain into the\r\nvillage, we came to the West Branch of the Au Sable, which rises in the\r\nIndian Pass, and flows past the former dwelling of John Brown. The\r\nlittle wooden tenement is in full view from the road, and stands in the\r\nmidst of the clearing made by old John himself, with the aid of his\r\nsons. His grave is in the garden near the house, beside a huge rock. The\r\nplace is of his own selection, and is now visited by many who, while\r\nreprehending the means taken by the gray-haired enthusiast for the\r\naccomplishment of his designs, cannot but rejoice that the final freedom\r\nof every human being within the limits of our country seems so probable\r\na result of the present struggle. The neighbors--even those of opposing\r\npolitical creeds--give John Brown an excellent character for integrity\r\nand charitable deeds. His family have all left the region, and are, I\r\nbelieve, scattered through the great West.\r\n\r\nCrossing the Au Sable, we soon came to the tamarac forests and\r\nwhortleberry plains, so characteristic of the tract between that river\r\nand the Saranac lakes. We had left the arbor vitæ and the juniper with\r\nthe Boquet range, the beech and maple with the valleys and the lower\r\nportions of the Adirondac, and now found ourselves chiefly amid birches,\r\nyellow and white, spruce firs, and interminable stretches of fantastic\r\ntamarac. The hills lower as we reach the lake region proper, and, while\r\nstill picturesque, the Saranacs can boast no near mountains such as\r\nskirt Lake Placid and the two 'Ponds of the Au Bable.' Tahawus and\r\nWhiteface are indeed visible from the Saranac waters, but far away, and\r\nshorn of much of their grandeur. The lakes themselves are elevated some\r\ntwelve hundred feet, perhaps, above the level of the sea, and the\r\nclimate is correspondingly bracing and delightful. There are at Saranac\r\ntwo inns, at either of which the traveller can make himself very\r\ncomfortable. At six o'clock P. M., we found ourselves at the house\r\nimmediately upon the lake, and, after an excellent supper, were ready\r\nfor a row upon the clear, shining water. The evening was delightful, the\r\nsun just setting, the low, wooded shores (rising beyond into higher\r\nhills) flooded with golden light, the temperature elysian, our oarsman\r\nbroad browed, broad shouldered, and athletic, our boat one of the fairy\r\ncraft, sharp at both ends, and light as possible, borne by guides over\r\nportages from lake to lake, and the whole scene as placidly beautiful\r\nand reposeful as the most vivid imagination could desire. War,\r\ncontention, suffering, even the law, trade, politics, or any acute state\r\nof feeling, seemed incomprehensible excrescences upon the normal state\r\nof man's being, which there, indeed, appeared to be an endless floating\r\nover placid waters, with the tinkling of oars and the even song of birds\r\nfor all needful sounds, and those long, low, slanting rays of golden\r\nlight forever stealing through half-closed lids, and steeping the nerves\r\nand brain and tired senses in long dreams of peace and quietude--dreams\r\nwithout the wearisomeness of monotony or the shock of awaking.\r\n\r\nNight, however, came at last, and with it forgetfulness; morning, too,\r\ncame in due season, and with it, the daily call for active thought and\r\nexertion.\r\n\r\nFrom Saranac, by means of boats, guides, and camping out, delightful\r\nexcursions can be made through the lakes, the two Saranacs, Round, Long,\r\nand Racket Lakes, and the Racket River. This region has been much\r\ntravelled and often described.\r\n\r\nOur faces, however, must be turned eastward, and the following day found\r\nus again in our wagon, _en route_ for Placid Lake. To reach this, we\r\nleft the return stage about two miles west of North Elba, and walked\r\nnorthward two miles through open country and some beautiful woodland,\r\nuntil we came out upon Bennet's Pond, on whose shore stands the pleasant\r\nfarmhouse where we intended to pass the night. The owner and his family\r\nwere absent, but we found a smiling little handmaiden, who brought us a\r\ncooling draught, and an antique whaler, who offered to show us the way\r\nto Lake Placid and give us a row.\r\n\r\nPlacid Lake is a beautiful, clear sheet of water, about five miles long\r\nand two or three wide. It is divided down the centre by three islands,\r\ncharmingly wooded. The surrounding mountains are high, and at the\r\nnorth-easterly end rises Whiteface, nearly, if not quite, 5,000 feet in\r\nheight, the lower portion clad in deciduous trees, the middle in spruce,\r\nand the upper rising bare and white, with a great slide of many hundred\r\nfeet extending from the top toward the lake, and marking out the steep\r\npathway by which the ascent must be made. Bennet's Pond is about a mile\r\nand a half long, and half a mile broad. Bennet is a contraction of\r\nBenedict--Benedictus--Blessèd--and never, surely, did blue expanse of\r\nlimpid crystal better merit the appellation--Lake of the Blessèd. Its\r\nshores are gently sloping, and beyond the nearer hills rise the giant\r\nsummits of the highest peaks. These two sheets of water are within a\r\nquarter of a mile of each other, but have no communication, and are\r\ndivided by a ridge of land, chiefly cleared, from whose top the view is\r\nas beautiful as any view from the same elevation to be obtained in\r\nAmerica. To the north lies Lake Placid, with its shining waves, its\r\nislands, and the stately Whiteface; and to the south, the\r\nheaven-reflecting Lake of the Blessèd, crowned by the noble dome of\r\nTahawus, and his splendid retinue, Colden, McMartin, McIntire, Wallface,\r\nDial Mountain, Nipple Top, and Moriah. To the east and west are wooded\r\nhills, completing the panorama, and enclosing a scene as enchanting as\r\nany single one the writer ever looked upon.\r\n\r\nThe following day our host, who had meantime returned, drove us down\r\nthrough the Wilmington Pass to Upper Jay, and thence through Keene to\r\nthe Keene Flats, a distance in all of between twenty and twenty-five\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nThe Wilmington Pass, though not so rough and rugged as its far-famed\r\nrival, the Indian Pass, is far more beautiful, and quite as majestic.\r\nThe great cliffs overhanging the road, and the swift Au Sable, the fine\r\nrapids, and the fall of over a hundred feet, the noble views of\r\nWhiteface and the dark, steep peaks rising round it, all combine to\r\nrender this one of the most impressive mountain chasms we have ever\r\nvisited. After passing through the defile, we left the West Branch of\r\nthe Au Sable, and crossed a low ridge to Upper Jay, where we again came\r\nupon the East Branch, and ploughed our way through heavy sands to Keene,\r\nwhere we dined, and whence the road up the valley to the Keene Flats\r\nbecomes firmer and less tedious. The way was bordered by rich fields of\r\ngrass and grain, potatoes in abundance, flax in pale azure flower, and\r\nacres blue with the beautiful campanula or harebell. At the inn in Keene\r\nwe met our rebellious friend Spart, who, having tired of his chase, had\r\nreturned to his former headquarters.\r\n\r\nToward the 'Flats,' five miles above Keene, the intervale grows\r\nnarrower, and the bordering mountains become loftier, wilder, and\r\ncorrespondingly more grand. Dix's Peak towers above the southern\r\nextremity of the valley.\r\n\r\nWe passed the night at a comfortable farmhouse, there being no inn at\r\nthe 'Flats,' and the following morning were driven back to\r\nElizabethtown, with the increased store of information, health, and\r\nadmiration for the Adirondac country we had amassed during our three and\r\na half days' scouting excursion.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOUNT TAHAWUS.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of August found us once more housed under the neat roof of\r\nour farmer host at the Keene Flats, and not only Elsie and myself, but\r\nalso sundry friends, drawn thither by our praise of the beauty of the\r\nland and the fineness of the air. There were the brilliant M. W. C.,\r\nlearned in all philosophical lore, and with feeling and imagination\r\nsufficient to furnish out half a dozen poets; the staid but energetic M.\r\nT., whose portrait in our gallery occupies, a conspicuous place in the\r\nsmall niche devoted to model women; the gay and witty A. I., whose blue\r\neyes imperil so many hearts, but whose frank, keen speech quickly puts\r\nto rout all popinjays and useless danglers; also E. B. C. (our\r\nDiogenes), a faithful knight from Caissa's thoughtful train, a rapid\r\nwalker and sharp thinker; and last, a merry little four-year-old, whose\r\nquaint sayings are heeded and treasured as if emanations from Delphos or\r\nDodona. Our Orpheus had gone to Saranac.\r\n\r\nOur purpose was to visit the Au Sable Ponds, with the waterfalls in\r\ntheir neighborhood, and to ascend Mount Tahawus; but alas! for weather!\r\nThe haze settled down so thickly that the nearest hills were\r\nundistinguishable. A violent thunder storm came, but brought no relief.\r\nDesperate, we thought we might at least see the ponds and the falls, and\r\nearly one hazy morning started off with strong wagon, stout horses, and\r\ncareful driver. The distance to the Lower Pond is seven miles--three\r\nexcellent, and four so execrable that nearly all our party preferred\r\nwalking to the jolting over rocks and stumps and ploughing through rich,\r\ndeep forest mould, dignified by the name of driving. This is a new road,\r\njust opened, and the intention is, we believe, to work it into better\r\nshape as rapidly as possible. The intervale ceases at the end of the\r\nfirst three miles, where the road leaves the Au Sable and winds up a\r\nhill to the last clearing, whence the view to the blasted, riven sides\r\nof Mount Moriah, towering opposite, is wonderfully grand. Thousands of\r\nacres of bare rock, scarred and lined, and apparently nearly\r\nperpendicular, form the western slope of that gaunt giant. The road soon\r\nafter passes the cabin of one of the oldest pioneers of the region,\r\ncrosses Gill Brook, on which are some charming cascades, and, through a\r\nnoble forest of beech, basswood, maple, birch, and some evergreens,\r\nfinds its way to the lofty shores of the Lower Pond. Arrived there, the\r\nhaze was thicker than ever, giving to view only the sparkling waters at\r\nour feet, and the nearest mountains, whose craggy sides overhang the\r\nlake. To cap the climax, a fishing party had carried off both boats, so\r\nthat a nearer acquaintance with the Lower Pond was impossible, and the\r\nUpper could not be seen at all--these ponds forming no exception to the\r\ngeneral Adirondac rule, that any sheet of water navigable for boats\r\nrequires no road upon its bank. And indeed, a road round this Lower Pond\r\nwould be a considerable undertaking, the shores are so steep and high,\r\nthe rocks often rising perpendicularly from the water. Crossing the\r\ngreat dam at the outlet, our guide led us through tangled patches of\r\nmagnificent wild raspberries, 'through brake and through briar,' to the\r\nopening of a narrow gorge through which poured a small stream. Climbing\r\nup over the rocks and bowlders, we soon reached the end of the chasm,\r\nwhere we were enchanted by the spectacle of the most fairy-like and\r\npeculiar waterfall we had ever beheld. The Cascade Brook here falls over\r\na precipice of about 150 feet. The little stream at this point makes a\r\nright-angled turn, and thus is built up an opposing wall of equal\r\nheight. The chasm is so deep and narrow, that the water, descending in a\r\nsilvery veil, seems flowing from the clouds. A heavy fringe of trees\r\nbordering the top, adds to the mystery and the apparent elevation. The\r\ncampanula, as is usual with this delicate blossom, hangs out its blue\r\nbella and slender foliage from every jutting cornice and earth-filled\r\ncranny. Below, the water has worn away a series of steep, narrow steps,\r\nand comes leaping and foaming down, as if a magic wand had touched the\r\nrocks, and at each touch a springing fountain had gushed forth.\r\n\r\nOn our way back to the 'Flats,' we went a mile off the main road, to\r\nvisit another fall on Roaring Brook. The precipice here is some 250 feet\r\nin height. A great slide has bared the rock for many yards on either\r\nside of the fall, which has worn deep grooves for its passage, and\r\nclings to the face of the mountain, as if it feared to lose itself amid\r\nthe savagery of the surrounding desolation. Here, as in all the\r\nneighboring region, are plainly visible the terrible effects of the\r\ngreat freshet of October 1st, 1856. We were told that, in the vicinity\r\nof this fall, neither the heavy rain nor the rushing waters could for a\r\ntime be heard, only the rattling and battering of stones, as if the\r\nTitans had again taken to pelting the poor earth with whatever of rock\r\nand bowlder they could lay their hands upon. The State dam at the outlet\r\nof the lower Au Sable broke down, and the freed lake rushed out through\r\nthe valley, over the meadows, carrying away bridges, dams, mills,\r\nhouses, and whole fields of earth, with their crops. The Au Sable River\r\nrose three feet in fifteen minutes, and many persons perished before aid\r\ncould reach them. Bowlders, rocks, trees, stumps, and timber were\r\nwhirled along by the boiling flood. Bowlders of six feet in diameter\r\nwere afterward found lying twenty feet above the bed of a brook where\r\ntrout had been caught before the freshet. They had been brought down\r\nstream some forty rods, and piled one above another. The effects of the\r\nrise were felt all the way to the mouth of the river, the high stone\r\nbridge at Keeseville being the only one on the whole course left\r\nstanding, and that, to this day, bearing a stone inscription marking the\r\nalmost incredible height to which the water rose on that eventful first\r\nof October. The inhabitants of the region sued the State for damages;\r\nbut as the dam had been constructed in consequence of a petition of\r\nsundry of those inhabitants, for the purpose of running logs down the\r\nriver at all seasons, the court decided that the State was not\r\nresponsible for the consequences. John's Brook, which flows into the Au\r\nSable near the farmhouse at which we stayed, bears wild marks of this\r\ndesolating freshet; indeed, one can scarcely credit the fact that the\r\npretty little stream and smoothly purling river could ever have met in\r\nsuch desperate conflict as is evidenced by the scars and rifts still\r\nexisting near their confluence.\r\n\r\nThis John's Brook, by the way, is the shortest route up Mount Tahawus,\r\nthe entire distance from the 'Flats' being only ten miles. As the\r\ngreater number of visitors, however, desire to see the Au Sable Ponds\r\n_en passant_, no path has been 'bushed out,' and that mode of ascent is\r\npracticable only for hunters or woodsmen familiar with the region.\r\n\r\nAt length a 'wind blew out of the north, chilling and killing' that\r\nterrible haze, and rendering the prospect of a distant view at least\r\npossible. Tahawus loomed up before the mind's eye clear and majestic.\r\nSuch an invitation being irresistible, the little party were soon ready\r\nfor their journey, said party consisting of Elsie, E. B. C., and Lucy\r\nD., with three guides--an old pioneer, short, slight, weather-beaten,\r\nand sun-browned, a younger aspirant for scouting honors, tall, handsome,\r\nand athletic, and a novice, making his first ascent of the kingly\r\nmountain, but offering a pair of broad shoulders that promised to do\r\ngood service in the bearing of the necessary packs. Each guide carried\r\nhis own axe, blanket, and provisions, and, in addition, his share of our\r\nunited baggage, which consisted of a thick Mexican blanket, four shawls,\r\ntwo heavy and two lighter, a woollen cap, a water-proof cloak with hood,\r\none overcoat, two loaves of bread, a small piece of salt pork, a little\r\ncan of butter, two or three pounds of maple sugar, a little bag of\r\ncornmeal, two pounds of crackers, the same quantity of chocolate, some\r\ntea, a small tin pail, a frying pan, three tin saucers, three knives,\r\nforks, and spoons. A pint of brandy and the same of whiskey were carried\r\nin flasks to meet emergencies of cold or weariness, and a canteen for\r\nwater was also taken to serve as a pitcher, and to bear that refreshing\r\nelement to heights where no springs could be hoped for. It will be seen\r\nthat we had reduced our appliances to the smallest quantity compatible\r\nwith proper warmth and nourishment, and the possibility of being\r\ndetained out several days, perhaps, by stress of weather. We had at\r\nfirst thought india-rubber blankets indispensable, but having been\r\nadvised against their use as conducive to rheumatism, and, besides,\r\nfinding them difficult to procure, we started without, and certainly\r\nnever missed them. The garments worn on such an excursion should, as far\r\nas practicable, all be woollen, and the shoes moderately thick, but not\r\ntoo heavy. A light umbrella will be found a useful addition in case of\r\nsudden rain or very hot sun. Each person will carry such toilet\r\narrangements as he or she may deem necessary, only let them be as light\r\nas possible, every ounce on such a tramp soon becoming a matter of\r\nserious consequence.\r\n\r\nWe left the farmhouse at half past six in the morning, and drove in the\r\nwagon as far as the road was good, three miles, namely, to the last\r\ncabin on the way to the Au Sable Ponds. There our guides shouldered\r\ntheir packs, and our party was increased by the addition of 'Uncle\r\nDavid,' another ancient pioneer, who was to row us up the Lower Pond in\r\na large Albany-built boat kept by him for that purpose. He talks of\r\nbuilding a moderate-sized tenement at the lower end of the lake, for the\r\naccommodation of travellers. I doubt not it would be well patronized.\r\n\r\nNow, our Diogenes does not use the lantern of his wit so much to seek\r\nout a thoroughly honest man, as to discover the honesty and good will\r\npertaining to each individual specimen of the _genus homo_. The\r\nconsequence is a series of pleasant results, people usually showing him\r\nwhatever of good may be in them, and esteeming him proportionately. As\r\nUncle David was discussing the amount of furniture required for his\r\nintended caravansary, he paused to ask if feather beds would be thought\r\na necessity. Diogenes replied that 'every goose needing feathers could\r\nbring them on his own back,' which shaft _took_ immensely, as proved by\r\nthe loud guffaws and low chuckles that echoed through the beautiful\r\nforest whose branches shaded us from the August sun. _His_ reputation as\r\na wit of the first water was firmly established, and every pun and jest\r\nthereafter succeeding was crowned by the halo of this first success.\r\n\r\nThe four miles to the Pond were speedily and gayly accomplished, and\r\nthere we took boat to cross the lake, Uncle David rowing _us_, and the\r\ngood-humored, broad-shouldered 'novice,' the scow to be used for our\r\nreturn, in case we were not back at the time then supposed probable.\r\n'Bill's' rowing was the source of much merriment, the strokes proving\r\npowerful, but the course amusingly devious. So little does it take to\r\nentertain people in the woods, who have laid aside grim behavior and\r\nquestioning philosophies, and have for the nonce become veritable\r\nchildren of nature, knowing that this earth is beautiful and that God is\r\ngood, and caring for little else.\r\n\r\nThe Lower Au Sable Pond is from one to two miles long, its banks are\r\ncraggy, steep, and high, the general impression grand and somewhat\r\ndesolate. The dam, by raising the water, has destroyed many of the trees\r\nalong the shore, and filled the upper portion with driftwood, which\r\nblocks the channel and is altogether unsightly. There is a winter road,\r\na mile in length, cut through the forest from the Lower to the Upper\r\nPond. This road is so overgrown that in summer it is a mere pathway. The\r\nUpper Pond reached, we again embarked in a light boat, our young athlete\r\nrowing. Uncle David had quitted us at the upper lake. This row was not\r\nnecessary, the path to Tahawus, or Mount _Mercy_, as our guides called\r\nit, turning off at a right angle from the lower end of the upper lake,\r\nbut was taken to show us the inexpressibly lovely Upper Pond, and\r\ntransport us to certain bark shanties presumed to offer excellent\r\nfacilities for dining purposes. The lake is about two miles long, and\r\none broad. Its shores are gently sloping, and wooded with splendid trees\r\nof the primeval forest, beech, birch, maple, and spruce. The soil is\r\nexcellent, and the wild flowers and mosses are luxuriant and abundant.\r\nThe steep rocks circling the Lower Pond are visible through a cleft, the\r\nsingular, jagged ridge known as the Gothic Mountains is in full view,\r\nthe sharp peak of the Haystack lifts its bare top far into the skies,\r\nthe North River Mountain crowns the south, and graceful waving lines of\r\nwooded hill complete the circle; the clear water gives back the most\r\nwonderful reflections, and those 'ladies of the forest,' the white\r\nbirches, could ask no more transparent mirror. There is nothing to mar\r\nthe effect of the whole, no driftwood, no burnt patches, no\r\nragged-looking clearing--all is harmonious and entirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOur dinner was a light one. Indeed, our experience was, that while we\r\nrequired a substantial breakfast and supper, but little was needed in\r\nthe middle of the day, and that little better cold than warm.\r\n\r\nReturning in the boat to the end of the lake, we struck into the pathway\r\nto Tahawus, a track of hunters, marked by sable traps; and here began\r\nwork in earnest. The pioneer took the lead, sweating and grumbling under\r\nhis load, for the day was warm, and the sun but little over an hour past\r\nthe meridian. Fortunately, he was not a very rapid walker, making only\r\nfrom two to two and a half miles per hour, so there was no danger of\r\nfatigue to any of the party, except to our Diogenes, who measures\r\nweariness by time and not by miles, walking more easily eight miles in\r\ntwo hours than in four.\r\n\r\nOn and up we went, ascending a gentle declivity until we came to a brook\r\nsaid to be two miles from the boat landing. There we cooled, rested, and\r\ndrank of the fresh, clear water, before commencing the steep ascent of\r\nthe Bartlett Mountain, a spur of the Haystack, needful to be crossed\r\nbefore reaching the actual foot of Tahawus. The ascent is some three\r\nquarters of a mile, and the descent on the other side about as far, but\r\nnot nearly so steep or considerable. Thus, three and a half miles of\r\nwalking, through a dense forest, with no view out except an occasional\r\nglimpse of the Haystack, the Skylight, or the side of Tahawus, brought\r\nus from the lake to the basin of the 'Mount Marcy stream.' The sun was\r\nstill high in the heavens, and the bark shanties in the 'basin' having\r\nfallen in, rendering the construction of new ones imperatively\r\nnecessary, we concluded to push on and build our camp somewhat nearer\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nDescending the Bartlett Mountain, we made our first acquaintance with\r\nthe renowned 'black fly' of the Adirondacs. We had heard so much of this\r\npest, and seen so little of him, that we began to think his existence\r\nsomewhat mythical, in short, a traveller's tale, invented by men to keep\r\nwomen from venturing beyond the well-beaten track of ordinary\r\njourneying. At this, our second halt, however, he assaulted us so\r\nvigorously that we were glad to take refuge in the smoke of a _smudge_\r\nour guides had lost no time in making. For the benefit of the\r\nuninitiated, we may here explain that a smudge is a fire of leaves or\r\nsticks slightly dampened to make a denser smoke, and intended as a\r\nsafeguard against the attacks of black flies, midges, and mosquitoes,\r\nthe two latter nuisances appearing in the evening, when the flies have\r\nfinished their day's work. We saw the creatures, and found them somewhat\r\ntroublesome (especially when, later in the day, they insisted upon\r\nspreading in with bread and butter), but suffered no pain or even\r\ninconvenience from their bite. This may have been owing to the lateness\r\nof the season, or to the non-inflammatory condition of our blood. Pests\r\nthey are said to be, and doubtless are; but we think their general\r\nprevalence has been exaggerated, and they will be found chiefly beside\r\nwatercourses, near lakes, and on damp, marshy ground. Fishermen are\r\nespecially annoyed by them. If we intended to camp out for the mere\r\npleasure of that kind of life, we would choose the season when the flies\r\nare supposed to have disappeared; but if we had any special object in\r\nview, such as the ascent of some particular mountain, or the sight of\r\nany remarkable natural feature of the land, we would not suffer\r\nourselves, at any season, to be deterred by fear of the flies. Certain\r\ndistricts and certain conditions of atmosphere are doubtless especially\r\nfavorable to their development, but the refuge, a thick smudge, is\r\nalways at hand, or, if that be objected to, the traveller can try the\r\nrecipe of an old hunter at the Adirondac Iron Works (where the creatures\r\nare said to be particularly rampant), namely, a coating of grease mixed\r\nwith essence of penny-royal. We fear we would prefer the results of a\r\nvigorous attack to the use of this latter safeguard; but no one knows\r\nwhat he may do until he is well tried.\r\n\r\nA short distance above the 'basin' we came to a final halt, in a\r\nsplendid spruce forest, and near a little stream, that necessary\r\naccompaniment of a camping ground. It was feared lest the season was so\r\nfar advanced that the spruce bark would no longer peel; but our tall\r\nyoung aspirant speedily tested the question by a few vigorous,\r\nwell-directed strokes of his axe, and soon a great circle of bark, six\r\nfeet high and nine feet in breadth, stood ready for use. Five other\r\npieces, rather less in size, were found sufficient to furnish the sides\r\nand roof of our hut, which was made by cutting down two stout young\r\nsaplings to supply the crotched stakes for the triangular front, and a\r\nthird, to serve as ridge pole, extending back into the gently sloping\r\nbank of dry turf covered with dead spruce leaves. We were a mile and a\r\nhalf from the top of Tahawus, and had entered the great belt of spruce\r\nforest encircling the middle regions of the mountain; deciduous trees,\r\nwith the exception of a few birches, had already been left behind. Round\r\nthese stakes were arranged the great layers of bark, making a perfectly\r\nwater-tight cabin, with open doorway, and large enough to give\r\ncomfortable shelter to as many as four persons. The enclosed space was\r\nthen covered with soft moss, and a thick layer of spruce twigs laid\r\nwrong side up. Over this spicy flooring we spread our gayly-striped\r\nblanket, and then sat down within our substantial wigwam to enjoy the\r\nblaze and crackle of the bright fire of great logs that had been kindled\r\na few feet from the entrance.\r\n\r\nA similar edifice, somewhat less imposing as to size and detail, was\r\nthen constructed for the use of the guides. These operations employed\r\nour three men with their axes the greater part of two hours. Supper was\r\nthe next matter under consideration, and was deftly prepared by 'Sid,'\r\nthe aspirant, who proved himself an excellent cook. Our bill of fare\r\nconsisted of hasty pudding (corn mush), eaten with butter and maple\r\nsugar (a dish for a king, and therefore well suited to sundry of the\r\nsovereign people, only Elsie and I, having no vote, cannot in any sense\r\nbe called sovereign), bread and butter, crackers, and toast. Our guides,\r\nin addition, ate a slice of raw pork. Diogenes tried it, but pronounced\r\nit rather too much like candles to be very palatable south of Labrador\r\nor Kamtschatka.\r\n\r\nSupper over, the sun had set, and the only work that remained for the\r\ntwilight was the gathering of the fuel to feed the fires during the\r\ncoming night.\r\n\r\nDaylight faded away, the moon rose, and the gay chat by the fireside\r\nbeing exhausted, a silence, profound, and unbroken save by the crackling\r\nflames, fell upon the quiet, gray old forest. By and by the fire died\r\ndown, and not a single sound could be heard, not the rustle of a bough,\r\nthe tinkling of the stream, or the stirring of any forest creature. The\r\nmoon sailed over the treetops, and a ghostly dreaminess lulled every\r\nsense, not to sleep, but to languid repose. Fatigue, thus far, there had\r\nbeen none, but physical and mental excitement plenty, and hence the\r\nwriter's sleep during her first night of camping out lasted about one\r\nhalf hour. She watched the careful guides, how each one rose once during\r\nthe short night to feed the fires, the elder one alert, the two younger\r\ndrowsy and but half awake; her mind wandered with Humboldt and Bonpland\r\nto South America, with Dr. Kane to the Arctic zone, with Winthrop over\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, with Dr. Livingstone to Central Africa, and with\r\nFather Huc to Tartary and Thibet. The busy, confined life of a city\r\nseemed an absurdity, the woods the only rational place for human beings\r\nto dwell in, and spruce boughs the only bed suitable to the dignity of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nMorning broke, and with the dawn the guides were up preparing\r\nbreakfast. Bill of fare: Salt pork, first parboiled to extract the\r\nbrine, then drained off and fried crisp, bread and butter, toast,\r\ncrackers, and tea, with maple sugar, but without milk. Our little tin\r\npail served alike to draw water, boil hasty pudding, and make tea. But\r\nalthough the day had dawned and the sun risen, the light was feeble, and\r\nthe elder guide shook his head ominously.\r\n\r\n'Indeed,' said he, 'it won't be much use to go on up, for the Haystack\r\nlooks so blue that _durn'd_ haze must have come back again, and you'll\r\nhave no view from _Mercy_ to-day.'\r\n\r\n'Well, it can't be helped, but we'll try it anyhow!' was the unanimous\r\nresponse.\r\n\r\nWe were a mile and a half from the top of Tahawus, having already\r\nentered the great belt of spruce encircling the middle regions of the\r\nmountain, and having left behind all deciduous trees except a few\r\nbirches. The forest here is especially grand, the original wood still\r\nremaining, tall, wide of girth, dark, and sturdy. The girdled trees\r\nstanding near our camp looked at us reproachfully in the morning light;\r\nten giants doomed to death to furnish a night's covering to six pigmies!\r\nOur fires, too, were they safe, or might they not run along the\r\ninflammable turf and perhaps destroy acres of beautiful, precious\r\ntimber?\r\n\r\nBut time pressed, 'the dishes were washed,' and we must away. All the\r\nheavy articles were left in the camp, and nothing taken up with us\r\nexcept a light lunch, a canteen of water, and the shawls needed to\r\nprotect against the winds on the top. The little stream crossed, the\r\nascent began quite steeply. A half mile of walking brought us out of the\r\nwood, and to the foot of the great slide, a bare, sloping rock, some\r\nthousand feet in height. Up this slide, either on the rock, or beside\r\nit, through the bushes and the spruce trees, which soon become low and\r\nshrubby, leads the pathway, not difficult, but somewhat fatiguing, from\r\nits steepness. Indeed, the whole way up is so excellent one wonders so\r\nhigh a mountain can be ascended with so little exertion or actual\r\nclimbing. In places, the moss is some, six inches thick, and the feet,\r\nworn with stony ways, sink into it as if there to find lasting repose;\r\nbut _Excelsior_ is the cry, and the top of the slide the next goal to be\r\nwon.\r\n\r\nMeantime the haze had been turning into mist, and great clouds were\r\ngathering on the bare, rocky head of the mountain. The slide passed, the\r\npath winds through dense, low spruce growth, and, the last steep cliffs\r\ngradually overcome, the extreme limit of tree vegetation (four thousand\r\neight hundred feet) is passed, and the remaining rocky slope offers no\r\ngrowth except a few hardy plants, such as sandwort, grasses, and several\r\nvarieties of moss and lichen.\r\n\r\nThe summit is broad, and, although in part composed of broken rocks, is\r\nquite compact in structure. Its general form is rounded and dome-like.\r\n\r\nBut the view?\r\n\r\nHere we were among the clouds, the wind blowing freshly, and the mists\r\nsweeping past, obscuring every object below. In this wind lay our hope,\r\nand scarcely less in the mists, for they might be the means of\r\ndispersing the haze. There went a rift, a patch of blue sky--and there a\r\nbit of green mountain! Then again all was leaden, damp, and cold. We\r\nseemed to have reached the Ultima Thule, to be the sole living creatures\r\nin some far-away corner of an earth gone back to chaos and mysterious\r\ntwilight. Again a break, and again appeared a stretch of dark\r\nfir-covered mountain tops, an avalanche-riven peak, a bright, green\r\nfield, or a corner of some far-away blue water. This hide-and-go-seek\r\nbetween landscape and mist lasted some half hour, when the clouds all\r\nrolled away, and left us with bright sunlight and the most glorious view\r\nour eyes had ever rested upon. The extreme distance was still hazy, but\r\nthe nearer wilderness of forest and mountain was wild and grand enough\r\nto have satisfied the most fastidious. The elder guide, who had stood\r\nsome dozen times on the summit, missed the bits of Lake Champlain and\r\nsome dim outlines of hills and waters that ought to have been visible,\r\nbut we were quite content with the sharp ridge of the Haystack and its\r\ndeep chasm, the bold and beautiful lines of the Gothic Mountains, the\r\nstern, scarred face of Moriah, the distant, still cloud-capped Dix's\r\nPeak, the pleasant valley of the Au Sable, the Camel's Hump, the Schroon\r\nMountains, the Boreas Waters, Mud and Clear Ponds, the hills about Lake\r\nGeorge, Mounts Seward and Sandanona, Lake Sanford, Mounts McIntire,\r\nMcMartin, Golden, Whiteface, Bennet's Pond, the plains of North Elba,\r\nthe Skylight, with its singular rock whence is derived its name, and an\r\ninfinity of peaks of every possible form, all gathered about us as doing\r\nhomage to the stately monarch, the comely and benignant giant, Tahawus.\r\n\r\nThe sun was warm, and, sheltered by a rock to screen us from the west\r\nwind, we found a single shawl all-sufficient covering. Diogenes produced\r\nfrom his capacious pocket sundry lemons, which, added to some maple\r\nsugar, a block of chocolate, and a few crackers, furnished a delightful\r\nrepast. We had reached the top of the mountain about nine o'clock. By\r\neleven the clouds again began to thicken, and grew so dark upon their\r\nunder edges that we feared rain. McIntire had collected a murky company\r\nthat threatened with the rumble of heavenly artillery. Wishing to\r\ndescend the slide before a coming rain should render it slippery, we\r\ntook a last look, and hastened away down the rocky slope, through the\r\nshrubby spruces, to the top of the slide, where great stones, flung down\r\nthe bare, sloping rock, bounded and rebounded until they plashed into\r\nthe marshy pool, one thousand feet below.\r\n\r\nStopping only long enough at our camp to gather up our 'traps,' and to\r\ninscribe its name, 'Tahawus,' with a tiny sketch from Elsie, and a chess\r\nproblem from E. B. C., upon the 'barked' side of a spruce, we hurried\r\ndown to the 'Mount Marcy stream,' over the Bartlett Mountain, on to the\r\nUpper Pond. The thunder rumbled all around us, and we had several light\r\nshowers. Just as we reached the lake, the storm burst in all its fury.\r\nBy the aid of our shawls and umbrellas we managed to keep dry until a\r\nlull came and we could row to the bark shanties, where we purposed\r\npassing the night. It was only half past three, and we might have\r\nreturned to the 'Flats' that evening, but we did not care to walk\r\nthrough the wet woods in the rain, and, besides, desired a still further\r\nacquaintance with the beautiful Upper Pond.\r\n\r\nThe three bark huts on the shore of the lake had been recently erected\r\nand used by a hunting and fishing party. They proved perfectly water\r\ntight, and a bright fire of green logs soon dried all dampness out of\r\nour garments. Our supper that night was quite elaborate, both pork and\r\nhasty pudding entering into its composition. The rain continued to\r\ndescend, and pattered softly as we disposed ourselves to rest.\r\n\r\nThat repose was sweet and unbroken, save by a characteristic 'Te-he-he,'\r\nand 'Good morning, good morning!' uttered in the high but feeble voice\r\nof the elder guide as he came to mend the decaying fire. A reference to\r\nour watches showed the hour to be but one past midnight. It must have\r\nbeen a profound yearning for human sympathy that had induced our\r\ncourteous and considerate guide thus to awaken us. Sleep, however, soon\r\nagain took up her broken threads, and so firmly reknit their ravelled\r\nedges, that the web needed the morning dew and the approaching glories\r\nof a brilliant sunrise once more to break and give freedom to the\r\nprisoned senses.\r\n\r\nOur pioneer, who loved every peak and pond in the neighborhood with the\r\naffection of a discoverer, took advantage of the charming morning to row\r\nus all round the lake, to show us the pretty inlet with its beaver dam,\r\nand help us gather the singular leaves of the pitcher plant, and the\r\nbeautiful, fragrant white water lilies riding at anchor in the lucent\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nWe soon after took up our line of march for the Lower Pond, where we\r\nfound 'Uncle David,' with his sturdy wife and pretty, chubby children,\r\nawaiting our arrival. Rowing rapidly down the lake, we took our last\r\nMount Marcy lunch beside the outlet, and, early in the afternoon,\r\nreturned to the Flats. The time devoted to the excursion was thus a\r\nlittle over two and a half days. Going and returning we had driven six\r\nmiles, rowed four miles (exclusive of our visits to the Upper Pond), and\r\nwalked somewhat over twenty-one. There had been no fatigue and no\r\ndifficult climbing. Indeed, it would be no very serious matter to go one\r\nday and return the next. And hence we advise all travellers in that\r\nregion with sound lungs, moderate strength, and any love for forest life\r\nand magnificent scenery, to make the ascent. They will assuredly bring\r\nhome with them a host of pleasant memories, and many new and enchanting\r\npictures for that precious gallery already mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTIDINGS OF VICTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When David's winning son rebelled,\r\n    They smote the traitor low,\r\n  And thought the monarch would rejoice\r\n    At riddance of his foe.\r\n\r\n  But in his chamber all alone\r\n    That kingly head was bowed,\r\n  And for the erring Absalom\r\n    His father wept aloud.\r\n\r\n  The ministers astonished stood\r\n    At such a burst of grief!\r\n  The traitor's death alone could bring\r\n    Their sovereign sure relief.\r\n\r\n  Back to their tents in sullen gloom\r\n    The faithful warriors flee;\r\n  While still he cried, 'My son! my son!\r\n    Would I had died for thee!'\r\n\r\n  My country's wilful erring sons,\r\n    Disloyal men, but brave,\r\n  Such tears of anguish now she sheds\r\n    Above the traitor's grave!\r\n\r\n  Amid the pealing notes of joy\r\n    For glorious victory won,\r\n  Is heard Columbia's piercing cry,\r\n    'O Absalom, my son!'\r\n\r\n  Ye faithful men whose crimson blood\r\n    In her defence is shed,\r\n  Upbraid her not if thus she weep\r\n    Above the guilty dead!\r\n\r\n  Her noble heart is true to you,\r\n    But generous as brave,\r\n  She mourns in royal grief apart\r\n    For those she could not save.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESTHETICS OF THE ROOT OF ALL EVIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt behooves every man, toiling along this dusty roadway of life, to\r\nseize upon something which he may study and elaborate, that at the end\r\nof his journey he may look back and content himself it has not been\r\nutterly in vain to himself and his fellow pilgrims. A man with a mania,\r\nor, as the Greeks have it, a man with a _madness_, is the true\r\nworld-advancer. This madness, when cultured, ripens into talent; if\r\noriginal and inborn, we call it genius, and the subtile anatomists of\r\nthe French schools prove it by telling us that the brains of geniuses\r\nare diseased. The healthy oyster ministers only to the palate. It is the\r\ndiseased oyster that secretes the pearl for Miss Shoddy's necklace. It\r\nis the diseased brain that shines through the ages, lights men on to new\r\nepochs in knowledge, and advances the race to the millennial perfection.\r\nImmortal Jean Paul, picturing himself in Schoppe, knew this. For what is\r\nall of Schoppe's eloquent and matchless buffoonery, compared with his\r\nwise oracles, in the mad conflicts with his other 'I,' whom he saw in\r\nthe mirror of his diseased brain?\r\n\r\nTherefore, let every man have his madness, to which he may give his\r\nleisure and his thoughtful hours. Let it grow upon him, until it becomes\r\na strong, controlling, natural element, as Mozart grew into music and\r\nHaydon into painting, and is ingrained into his very habit and method of\r\nlife; for it is only thus and then he becomes a master, fitted to lead\r\nthe van in the world's march. Only, let it be a praise-worthy madness,\r\nand one the development of which wilt secure for himself some new fund\r\nof knowledge, and add to the store of his fellow men.\r\n\r\nIt was somewhat in this vein I looked upon a dingy skilling species,\r\nwith its rudely crossed hammers--a rough coin, bold, sturdy, and rigid\r\nas the old Norse character itself which formed the initial of my\r\ncabinet--a cabinet which has given to me new ideas of the low-browed\r\nRoman and elegant Greek; has admitted me to the arcana of their\r\nfascinating mythology; has whispered strange tales of a mummy's perfumed\r\nsleep in the shadow of the awful, eternal Sphynx; has taken me to the\r\nfall of Grenada, and, bridging over the dark lapse of the ages, has\r\nemerged with the resurrection of art into the bloody days of early\r\nEnglish history--the grim Puritanic times, when good old John Hull, the\r\nmintmaster, regulated the finances of the colonies, and filled his own\r\npockets with pine-tree shillings and sixpences; the horrors of Danton\r\nand Marat; marking faithfully each historic change from orient to\r\nOccident, and culminating in that latest triumph of the engraver's\r\ncunning skill--the Philadelphia Sanitary Fair medal, commemorating for\r\nour children and children's children the magnificent benefactions of the\r\npeople and the self-devotion of the Commissions--Christian and\r\nSanitary--the angels of mercy and charity, scattering blessings in the\r\nfurrows of war.\r\n\r\nThe _utile_ and the _dulce_ of the study of numismatics are shown in\r\nmany ways. Caraccio, Aretine, and Raphael studied the figures on the old\r\noboli and drachmas. So did Le Brun. Rubens was the most conscientious\r\ncoin and medal gatherer of his time, and applied them sedulously to the\r\nfurtherance of his divine gifts. Petrarch found time between his sonnets\r\nto Laura to make the first classified collection on record, which he\r\npresented to the emperor of Germany, with his well-known and remarkable\r\nletter. Alphonso, king of Naples, visited all parts of Europe gathering\r\ncoins in an ivory casket. The splendid Cosmo de' Medici commenced a\r\ncabinet which formed the nucleus of the Florentine collection. Matthias\r\nCorvinus, king of Hungary, made a cabinet, and Francis I. of France laid\r\nthe foundation of the Paris collection--the finest in the world. All\r\nartists recognize the value of coins, medals, and medallions. From them\r\nthey get the model faces and heads of the Greek and Roman, the copies of\r\nlost statues, the folds of the chlamys and the graceful sweep of the\r\ntoga, the eagles and ensigns, rams and trophies, the altars, idols, and\r\nsacrifices, the Olympian games, and the instruments of music,\r\nmathematics, and mechanics. They reveal the secrets of a thousand\r\nantiquated names and ceremonies, which but for the engraver's chronicle\r\nmust have been utterly lost.\r\n\r\nCoins throw additional light upon history. They illuminate the dark\r\npassages, clear away the obscurities, and bridge over the gaps. Hugo, in\r\n'Les Miserables,' says men solidified their ideas in architecture before\r\nthe printed page came from the brain of Faust. He might have added, they\r\nwrote their histories upon these bits of gold, silver, iron, brass, and\r\nbronze. Vaillant wrote the chronicles of the kings of Syria from a jar\r\nof medals, as Cuvier would build up the mastodon and give you the\r\nmonster's habits from a tooth or a tibia. The Roman denarii give the\r\nbest idea of Cæsar's well in the forum. The Epidaurian coins with the\r\nsnake of Æsculapius tell in brief characters how the Roman senate sent\r\nan embassy to the great father of medicine to come and heal them of the\r\nplague. The migration of the Phocian colony to Asia Minor is succinctly\r\ntold in the [Greek: phôchê], or seal, which followed the early Mayflower\r\nstamped upon one of the earliest of the Grecian coins. The late coins of\r\nthe Grecian series, with the portraits of Alexander, Ptolemy, Seleucus,\r\nLysimachus, and others, have lent to the historian a fresh and life-like\r\npicture of those stern days, and have been silent but incontrovertible\r\nwitnesses of the truth of the records which have come down to us.\r\nCymbeline, of Shakspeare, dates back to the Cunobelin of an ancient\r\nSaxon coin, struck before Boadicea's time. Who would have known of the\r\nGrecian domination in Bactria, long after Alexander's time, but for a\r\ncasual traveller who found the fact, together with a lost language, upon\r\na series of coins unearthed in that part of Asia? The coins of Alexander\r\nfix the capture of Egypt; those of Vespasian, the capture of Judea; and\r\nthose of Trajan, the capture of Parthia. They were the 'brief\r\nchroniclers of the time'--Stantonian bulletins, announcing each fresh\r\nconquest.\r\n\r\nThe coins of the ancient day--for our modern productions can hardly\r\nclaim the credit--blend artistic grace and beauty. Upon them art made\r\nits first and some of its best essays. A cabinet of Grecian and Roman\r\ncoins is a compact history of art from its inception to its meridian in\r\nthe culmination of Grecian splendor--and since that time, if we may\r\nbelieve Ruskin, we only approximate, or what is worse, degrade. The\r\ngradual decline of art and the decay of the empire are traceable on the\r\nRoman series. You may follow the downward steps, until it becomes nearly\r\nextinct, to revive, after a period of stagnation, in a new feeling in\r\nthe quaint but strong and rugged Gothic, the beautiful development of\r\nwhich may be seen in the coinage of modern Europe from the fifth to the\r\nfifteenth century. The Farnesian Hercules, the Venus de' Medici, the\r\nApollo Belvidere, and the famous equestrian Marcus Aurelius make their\r\nappearance upon the ancient medals. Undoubtedly many of the magnificent\r\ndesigns of Grecian medals in particular are but the types of Protogenes\r\nand Apelles, as Houdin's model cast of Washington has been photographed,\r\nas it were, upon the Wright medal. The grand Byzantine school of art is\r\nnowhere better brought out than on the coins of that period. The\r\ndetails of Constantine's coins are found in the ivory dyptics and those\r\nsplendidly illuminated Gospel vellums which art-despising monks kneeled\r\nupon from the seventh to the tenth century, and which art-loving monks,\r\neven in the middle of the nineteenth century, used in the decoration of\r\ntheir monastery halls at Mount Athos.\r\n\r\nI come to a phase in the study of numismatics which to many will seem\r\nparadoxical--the romance of coins--and pick out here and there a few\r\nincidents, which I shall string together, not heeding closely\r\nchronological sequence.\r\n\r\nOne of the saddest pictures in all history is the first mention that is\r\nmade of money. Sarah was dead, and Abraham was sojourning among\r\nstrangers in a strange land. He mourned for his wife, and stood up\r\nbefore the sons of Heth, and begged of them to intercede with Ephron,\r\nthe Hittite, for the cave of Machpelah, as a burial place. Ephron\r\nliberally offered him the cave and the field, but the patriarch insisted\r\nupon payment; whereupon the Hittite answered: 'My lord, hearken unto me;\r\nthe land is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that betwixt\r\nme and thee? Bury, therefore, thy dead.' Abraham weighed the 'four\r\nhundred shekels of silver current (money) with the merchant,' and the\r\nfield and the trees and the caves were Abraham's, and Sarah was buried.\r\nThe first use of money is the last, and the cave of Machpelah, typical\r\nof the last resting place of all men, is the most important because the\r\nmost imperative use of money. He that hoards and he that squanders,\r\nCroesus and Lazarus, at the end of life, provided they have money\r\nenough to purchase their caves of Machpelah, have fortune enough, and\r\nmore than enough, for they may not carry gold and silver with them\r\nthrough the valley of the Shadow. We buy and sell, we loan and\r\nspeculate, we hoard our shining wealth as Croesus hoarded the golden\r\nsands of Pactolus in the treasury of Delhi, but when we come to the cave\r\nof Machpelah, we leave it at the entrance, and go into the darkness\r\nunencumbered.\r\n\r\nThe earliest and standard specimen of Roman coinage was the _as_,\r\nsubdivided almost indefinitely, and originally weighing a pound. This\r\nponderous coin subserved a purpose which our penny does to-day. It had\r\nupon the obverse the double-headed Janus, and upon the reverse the keel\r\nof a ship, rudely done, but answering the requirements of the light,\r\njuvenile gambling known as pitching coppers. _Capita aut navem_, 'Heads\r\nor the ship,' the Roman boys cried, as Young America cries now, 'Heads\r\nor tails.' It is an eminently conservative custom, and Master Freddy, as\r\nhe tosses his new bronze cent, may summarily answer paternal reproof by\r\nshowing that Master Tullius, two thousand years ago, pitched the _as_\r\nhis father coined, and, for aught we know, grew to be a wise emperor and\r\na great man.\r\n\r\nJudea is represented upon several coins of the time of Titus and\r\nVespasian by the figure of a woman with flowing hair and bared breasts,\r\nseated upon the ground in a posture of sorrow and captivity, above her\r\nthe wide-spreading branches of the palm, and behind her a stalwart Roman\r\nsoldier in mail, leaning upon his spear. Thus exactly did the Roman\r\nengraver follow out upon these coins the language of the Scriptures. The\r\nPsalmist describes this posture in the lamentations of the Jews over\r\ntheir captivity. 'By the waters of Babylon we sat down and wept.' Still\r\nmore remarkable is it that the prophet, in a passage foretelling this\r\nidentical captivity, likens Judea to a woman sitting upon the ground\r\nwrapped in sorrow.\r\n\r\nIt is not often that coins have been used as vehicles of wit or for\r\nplays upon words, but there are examples upon record. Some of the German\r\ncoins represent in the legends the years in which they were minted. A\r\ncoin of Gustavus Adolphus also is an excellent illustration of this\r\npractice. The legend is: 'ChrIstVs DVX ergo trIVMphVs.' Take the\r\ncapitalized letters or numerals from the words, and arrange them in\r\ntheir proper order, and you have 1627, the year in which the coin was\r\nstruck. Upon a coin of Trio Lucretius, a member of the _Lucretia gens_,\r\nwho would have remained unknown to this day but for his coin, a case of\r\npunning by means of types occurs. The obverse has the head of Apollo;\r\nthe reverse, the crescent moon and seven stars, or rather _triones_--the\r\nconstellation of the Ursa Major. The sun and moon refer to the family\r\nname, while the _triones_ are an allusion to the surname. Pope Urban\r\nVIII., with execrable taste and questionable wit, upon repairing certain\r\nroads, struck a medal with the legend: _Beati qui custodiunt meas vias_,\r\n'Blessed are they who keep my ways.' The 'speaking types' of the ancient\r\nGrecian coins are very curious. The coinage of Rhodes has a rose for a\r\ntype, which flower bears the same name as the island. The coins of Side\r\nhave a pomegranate, in Greek, _side_ ([Greek: sidê]); Melos, the apple,\r\nin Greek, _melon_ ([Greek: mêlon]); Ancona, in Italy, the elbow, in\r\nGreek, _ancon_ ([Greek: agkon]); Cardia, the heart, in Greek, _cardia_\r\n[Greek: kardia].\r\n\r\nThe coins of Constantine the Great, 306 A.D., will always remain of\r\npeculiar interest, as connected with the early history of Christianity.\r\nConstantine, after forcing his brother-in-law, Licinius, from his\r\nEastern dominions, built Constantinople, and made Christianity the state\r\nreligion. The principal emblem upon his coins is the Labarum, or sacred\r\nbanner, bearing the monogram of Christ--the letters [Greek: Ch] and\r\n[Greek: R]--being the initials of [Greek: CHRISTOU], the angles of which\r\nare occupied by the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, Alpha\r\nand Omega, in allusion to Christ's declaration in Revelation. A rarer\r\ntype of Constantine's coins has the monogram, and the legend, _In hoc\r\nsigno vinces_. The _signum_ was the vision of a beautiful cross in the\r\nheavens, which was presented to the view of Constantine, near Milan,\r\nduring his march against Maxentius. To this cross he attributed both his\r\nvictory and conversion. These Christian emblems remained upon the coins\r\nof his successors until the reign of Julian the Apostate, who removed\r\nthem and substituted pagan emblems. Nor do they again appear until the\r\naccession of Michael Rhangabe (811-813), when the bust and sometimes the\r\nfull length of Christ is on the obverse, with the _nimbus_, and the\r\nlegend, _Jesus Christus nica(tor) rex regnantium_. Upon the reverse, the\r\nemperor, with a singular degree of boldness, is seated by the side of\r\nthe Virgin, the two holding aloft the banner of the cross.\r\n\r\nWe come to more modern coins. England and Ireland were in continual\r\ntrouble about the standard of coinage. On the accession of Mary, she\r\ndeclared the intention of restoring the old standard of silver coinage,\r\nviz., 11 oz. 2 dwt. fine, to 18 dwt. alloy; but, instead of that, the\r\nnew coinage was a pennyweight lower than that of Edward. Nor did it mend\r\nmatters that her handsome face and Philip's were on the obverse. The\r\nwits of the day had many a joke over it; and Butler's sarcastic pen\r\ncould not omit the opportunity of writing:\r\n\r\n  'Still amorous, fond, and billing,\r\n  Like Philip and Mary upon a shilling.'\r\n\r\nThe first manifestation of displeasure between the mother country and\r\nthe colonies was with Massachusetts, of course. The old Bay State was as\r\nimpatient toward masters then as later in the Revolution against George,\r\nand still later with the slaveholders. Charles II. was displeased with\r\nthe colonists for coining money, which he considered his royal\r\nprerogative, and intimated to Sir Thomas Temple that they must be\r\npunished, and the business stopped. Sir Thomas was considerable of a\r\nwag, and showed the king one of honest John Hull's shillings, on the\r\nreverse of which was the pine tree. The king asked him what sort of a\r\ntree that was. Upon which Sir Thomas replied that, of course, it was the\r\nroyal oak, which had saved his majesty's life. The king smiled at the\r\ncourtier's wit; but it is not reported that he allowed Hull to continue\r\nthe coinage.\r\n\r\nThe proverbial misfortunes of Ireland have attended even her coinage,\r\nand her troubles in that direction commenced as early as the reign of\r\nHenry VII. He coined sixpences for Ireland worth only fourpence in\r\nEngland. Mary issued base shillings and groats for Ireland, and\r\nElizabeth issued still baser ones, while she purified the coinage of\r\nEngland. James I. struck copper farthings of two sizes, that if they\r\nfailed in England, they might be used in Ireland for pence and\r\nhalfpence. Charles I. established a mint in Dublin, but, in the\r\nconfusion attendant upon his death, the Irish lost it. Cromwell gave\r\nthem tokens in place of coins of the realm; and James II. base silver\r\nmoney, made principally from brass cannon, and even this alloyed stuff\r\nwas gradually diminished in size. White metal followed, then lead, and\r\nfinally tin. George I. granted a patent to William Wood in 1737 for\r\ncoining pence and halfpence for Ireland, but he coined them of smaller\r\nsize than was stipulated in the patent. Dean Swift, with his merciless\r\nsatire, drove them out of Ireland, and his majesty, having no use for\r\nthem in England, sent them to his American colonies. Circulating media\r\nwere scarce here at that time, and anything in the shape of coins was\r\nwelcome. George II. did better for Ireland, and gave her honest coins.\r\nIn 1760 the famous _voce populi_ halfpenny appeared, a company of\r\ngentlemen in Dublin having obtained permission to issue them. There was\r\na bit of quiet revenge in this halfpenny. The head of the sovereign,\r\nthough apparently done in the usual manner of the king's portrait, was\r\nin reality a portrait of the Pretender. The coins attained a\r\nconsiderable circulation before the trick was discovered, and then they\r\nwere suppressed.\r\n\r\nCoins have figured in sermons. Bishop Latimer, on the 8th of March,\r\n1549, delivered the following sarcastic sermon. On a previous occasion\r\nhe had spoken jestingly of the new currency of Edward VI. For this he\r\nwas accused of sedition, which charge he answered thus:\r\n\r\n'Thus they burdened me even with sedition. And wot ye what? I chanced in\r\nmy last sermon to speak a merry word of a new shilling, to refresh my\r\nauditory, how I was like to put away my new shilling for an old groat. I\r\nwas therein noted to speak seditiously. ... I have now gotten one more\r\nfellowe, a companion of sedition; and wot you who is my fellowe? Esay\r\n(Isaiah) the prophet. I spake but of a little prettie shilling; but he\r\nspeaketh to Jerusalem after another sort, and was so bold as to meddle\r\nwith their coynes. 'Thou proud, thou haughty city of Jerusalem.\r\n_Argentum tuum versum est in scoriam_;' thy silver is turned into what?\r\ninto testious _scoriam_, into dross,' Ah! seditious wretch! what had he\r\nto do with the mint? Why should he not have left that matter to some\r\nmasters of policy to reprove? Thy silver is dross; it is not fine; it is\r\ncounterfeit; thy silver is turned; thou hadst no silver. What pertained\r\nthat to Esay? Marry, he replied a piece of diversity in that policy; he\r\nthreateneth God's vengeance for it.\r\n\r\n'He went to the root of the matter, which was covetousness, which became\r\nhim to reprove; or else that it tended to the hurt of poore people; for\r\nthe naughtiness of the silver was the occasion of dearth of all things\r\nin the realm. He imputeth it to them as a crime. He may be called a\r\nmaster of sedition indeed. Was not this a seditious fellowe, to tell\r\nthem this even to their faces?'\r\n\r\nThe three-farthing piece struck in Elizabeth's reign is often mentioned\r\nin the poets. Shakspeare has an allusion to it in King John. He\r\nintroduces the bastard Falconbridge, ridiculing the personal appearance\r\nof his legitimate elder brother, having just before compared him to a\r\nhalf-faced groat:\r\n\r\n  'Because he hath an half face, like my father,\r\n  With that half face would he have all my land.'\r\n\r\nFarther on, he says he would not have such a person (body):\r\n\r\n            'My face so thin,\r\n  That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose,\r\n  Lest men should say, Look where three farthings goes;'\r\n\r\nalluding to the rose which was on both the obverse and reverse of the\r\ncoin. Beaumont and Fletcher, in the 'Scornful Lady,' show the difference\r\nbetween the penny and three-farthing piece, and inform us of a knavish\r\ntrick then practised, to impose upon ignorant people the lesser as the\r\ngreater coin. Lovelass, speaking of Morecraft, the usurer, says: 'He had\r\na bastard, his own toward issue, whipt and thin cropt, for washing out\r\nthe rose in three farthings to make them pence.'\r\n\r\nIn England, during the reign of George III., an act was passed to amend\r\nan act of the 51st of the king, respecting the gold coin and the notes\r\nof the Bank of England. By this act the provisions of the former statute\r\nwere extended to Ireland, and the notes of the bank there were placed\r\nupon the same basis as those of the Bank of England. While this act was\r\npassing the House, the following epigram appeared in the public papers:\r\n\r\n\r\nBANK NOTES AND GUINEAS.\r\n\r\n  Bank notes, it is said, once guineas defied\r\n  To swim to a point in trade's foaming tide;\r\n  But ere they could reach the opposite brink,\r\n  Bank notes cried to gold: 'Help us, cash us, we sink!'\r\n\r\n  'That paper should sink, and guineas should swim,\r\n  May appear to some folks a ridiculous whim;\r\n  But before they condemn, let them hear this suggestion:\r\n  In pun making, gravity's out of the question.\r\n\r\nThere is a romantic incident in the early history of Massachusetts,\r\nwhich has been often told. Money was scarce, and in 1652 the General\r\nCourt passed a law for the coinage of sixpences and shillings. Captain\r\nJohn Hull was appointed the mintmaster, and was to have one shilling in\r\nevery twenty for his labor. All the old silver in the colony, wornout\r\nplate, battered tankards, buckles, and spoons, and especially the\r\nbullion seized by the buccaneers then sailing the Spanish Main (for all\r\nwas honest that came to Hull's melting pot), was brought in for coinage,\r\nand the mintmaster rapidly grew to be the millionnaire of the colony,\r\nand suitors came from far and wide for the hand of his daughter. Among\r\nthem was Samuel Sewall, who was the favorite of the plump and buxom\r\nmiss. Hull, the mintmaster, roughly gave his consent: \"Take her,\" said\r\nhe, \"and you will find her a heavy burden enough.\" The wedding day came,\r\nand the captain, tightly buttoned up with shillings and sixpences, sat\r\nin his grandfather's chair, till the ceremony was concluded. Then he\r\nordered his servants to bring in a huge pair of scales. 'Daughter,' said\r\nthe mintmaster, 'go into one side of the scales.' Mrs. Sewall obeyed,\r\nand then the mintmaster had his strongbox brought in, an immense\r\nironbound oaken chest, which the servants were obliged to drag over the\r\nfloor. Then the mintmaster unlocked the chest, and ordered the servants\r\nto fill the other side of the scales with shillings and sixpences. Plump\r\nMrs. Sewall bore down hard upon her side of the scales, but still the\r\nservants shovelled in the bright, fresh pine-tree shillings, until Mrs.\r\nSewall began to rise. Then the mintmaster ordered them to forbear.\r\n'There, you Sewall,' said the magnanimous old money maker, 'take these\r\nshillings for my daughter's portion. Use her kindly, and thank Heaven\r\nfor her; for it is not every wife that is worth her weight in silver.'\r\nAnd Master Sewell took Mistress Sewall and thirty thousand pounds (not\r\navoirdupois, but sterling).\r\n\r\nThe liberty cap was first used as an emblem by the committee of safety\r\norganized at Philadelphia early in 1775. At a meeting on the 31st of\r\nAugust of that year, it was resolved by the committee that Owen Biddle\r\nprovide a seal for the use of the board, about the size of a dollar,\r\nwith a cap of liberty, with this motto: 'This is my right, and I will\r\ndefend it.' Upon the first cent issued by the United States Mint for\r\ncirculation, in 1793, the cap appears. This cap is the Phrygian cap, and\r\nall nations recognize it as the badge of liberty. When Spartacus rose at\r\nthe head of his fellow slaves against their Roman masters to obtain\r\nliberty, his followers were distinguished by this cap. Though their\r\neffort was unsuccessful, the principle of liberty still exists, to be\r\nfought for until the last manacle is struck from the last slave. And\r\nmankind has recognized that early struggle for freedom by adopting the\r\ncap as one of the attributes of the goddess of freedom.\r\n\r\nThe freaks of currency are singular. The early Greeks bartered with\r\ncattle; hence we derive _pecunia_ (money) from pecus (the flock). Cowry\r\nshells have bought slaves on the African coast, and wampum answered for\r\nmoney with the Indian, The Carthaginians, Frederick II. at the siege of\r\nMilan, Philip I. and John the Good, kings of France, used stamped\r\nleather, the latter inserting a silver nail in the centre. St. Louis, of\r\nFrance, issued the black coin made of billon. The Anglo-Saxons used\r\nrings, torques, and bracelets. Homer says the Greeks carried on their\r\ntraffic with bars and spikes of brass. Salt is the money of Abyssinia,\r\nand codfish in Iceland. In Adam Smith's day, the Edinburgh workmen\r\nbought bread with nails, and drank from foaming tankards paid for with\r\nspikes. Marco Polo found mulberry-bark money in China, stamped with the\r\nsovereign's seal, which it was death to counterfeit, as was the case\r\nalso with the Continental currency of our own country. The first\r\nfamilies of Virginia, now fighting for the ideas of aristocracy and\r\nlabor owned by capital, are the lineal and quite recent descendants of\r\nshiploads of women exported from the crowded capitals of Europe, with\r\nlittle regard to character or condition, and bought at so many pounds of\r\ntobacco per head. The cannon used by James II. in his desperate struggle\r\nfor the throne, were melted up and coined into the famous gun money; and\r\nthe bells of Paris which tolled over the horrors of the guillotine, in\r\nthe bloody days of Robespierre, met a similar useful end. Charles I.,\r\nwith a Vandal hand, melted up the plate of the aristocracy and the\r\nalmost inestimable relics of Oxford into siege pieces. In 1641,\r\nMassachusetts enacted that wheat should be received in payment of debts;\r\nand during the French Revolution, the convention, upon the motion of\r\nJean Bon Saint André, discussed the propriety of making wheat the\r\nstandard of value.\r\n\r\nFrom coins to wealth is but a step. The ancients surpassed the moderns\r\nin splendid wealth and lavish extravagance. Seneca, writing superb\r\ntreatises in favor of poverty, was worth nearly five millions of\r\ndollars. Lentulus, the astrologer, made his black arts yield him over\r\nthree millions. The delighted heirs of Tiberius found nearly thirty-six\r\nmillions in his coffers, and in less than a year Caligula spent the\r\nwhole of it. Milo's debts were Titanic, amounting to six millions. Cæsar\r\nhad a list of creditors whose name was legion, before he obtained any\r\npublic office; but he was soon enabled to present Curio with six hundred\r\nthousand dollars, Lucius Paulus with four hundred thousand, and\r\nServilia, the mother of Brutus, with a trifle of a pearl worth over\r\nthirty thousand. Mark Antony's house was sold to Messala for over half\r\na million, and Scaurus's villa was burned at a loss of over twelve\r\nmillions. Otho spent over fourteen millions in finishing the wing of a\r\npalace commenced by Nero. One of Caligula's dinners cost a million\r\ndollars; and one of Heliogabalus's breakfasts, twenty-seven thousand\r\ndollars, Oesopus, the actor, swallowed a pearl worth eleven thousand\r\ndollars, and Apicius, the gourmand, ate over seventy-seven millions\r\nduring his worthless life, and then committed suicide, because he was\r\nreduced one day to only a hundred thousand dollars in his purse.\r\n\r\nI hold in my hand a huge iron token which Ptolemy struck in\r\ncommemoration of his conquest of Egypt, and by its side the new two-cent\r\npiece of the United States, fresh and sparkling from the Mint at\r\nPhiladelphia. The one antiquated, rude, corroded, and begrimed in its\r\nlong conflict with time, and the other bright and vivid, its field and\r\nexergue unmarred, its emblems and legends clear and sharp. The coin of\r\nPtolemy has a history. The obverse gives us undoubtedly the head of\r\nJupiter, the cloud bearer, rugged, massive, stern, iron featured,\r\ntaurine neck, hair in great serpentine coils and shocks; the reverse, a\r\nmagnificent spread eagle, and the inscription in Greek, _Basileus\r\nPtolemaion_. Ptolemy, flushed with the victory he had won for Alexander,\r\nissued it over two thousand years ago. After subserving the purposes of\r\nAthenian barter, some swarthy Egyptian obtained it; but our friend the\r\nEgyptian, in time, was gathered to his fathers. He was embalmed, and\r\nslept in the shadow of the Pyramid, where his royal predecessors were\r\nsleeping, and by the side of the eternal Sphynx, whose riddle he could\r\nnot read in life. Perhaps death unsealed the mystery of those stony lips\r\nto him. The token was placed in the mummy case upon the Egyptian's lips,\r\nperhaps as Charon's toll. But, in that event, evidently our friend the\r\nEgyptian never crossed over the black river of Death, but is still\r\nwandering--a miserable shade--along its banks, seeking rest, and finding\r\nnone. Token and Egyptian remained in their tomb while Thebes flourished\r\nand decayed, Tyre and Sidon crumbled into ruins, Rome, mistress of the\r\nworld, cowered beneath the scourge of Goth and Vandal and Hun, and the\r\nearth was eclipsed in the night of the ages. Still the Pyramids towered\r\ntoward heaven, the Sphynx gazed on with calm, earnest eyes, Memnon made\r\nmusic of welcome to the sun, and our token sealed the shrivelled silent\r\nlips of the Egyptian. The world emerged from its night. Dante and\r\nAquinas, Copernicus and Galileo, Luther and Melanchthon, Gutenberg and\r\nFaust, Kant and Schlegel, Bacon, Leibnitz and Newton, Watt and Morse,\r\ntore away the seals before our token saw the light. It came forth into a\r\nnew world by the hand of a missionary, preaching a religion founded\r\nthree hundred years after it closed the lips of the Egyptian. The\r\nheathen god was upon its field, but the Christian religion had set aside\r\nthe old mythology of which it was a representative. I turn from this\r\nrelic of the past to the coin of the present, and upon the latter I find\r\nthe acknowledgment of that religion, and of dependence upon its\r\nimmutable Author: 'In God we trust;' and from this legend I augur\r\ndeliverance from the troubles that beset us, the vindication of outraged\r\nlaws, the Union of dissevered fragments, the return of peace to our\r\ndistracted land, the integrity of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRACLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople refuse to believe in miracles because they esteem, them\r\nincredible: how, then, do they believe in existence--in the being of\r\nanything? Is it credible--to human reason, I mean--that anything should\r\nbe without a cause? Nothing, so far as we can judge, _ever comes to_ be\r\nwithout an efficient cause--something that goes before, with power to\r\nbring that which comes after.\r\n\r\nBut existence is an indisputable fact: we must believe it, whether we\r\ncan or not.\r\n\r\nOh yes, one may say, but there is an infinite Being from all eternity,\r\nand He has produced all other forms of existence.\r\n\r\nVery well; but if that be so, do not let us trouble ourselves about what\r\nare called miracles. They come very easily after the creation of\r\nlight--the creation of sun and moon and stars; or even of nebulous\r\nmatter, so constituted that by its revolution in space it may generate\r\nthese wondrous orbs.\r\n\r\nBut there is a difficulty, it seems, about laws--natural laws: we are\r\nnot to suppose that they will ever he violated. But there is another law\r\nabove all these; all at least of the inanimate world, _i.e._, that the\r\nforces of brute matter are subject to the will, or whatever is analogous\r\nto will, in any living creatures. The law of gravitation is one of the\r\nmost universally operative; but every bird rising upon its wings, every\r\ndog in its leaps, yea, the grasshopper springing from the earth, sets\r\nthis law at defiance. Almost every common law of matter is set aside by\r\nthe ingenuity of man, as put forth by that most truly spiritual faculty,\r\nthe will.\r\n\r\nAre we then to suppose that the Almighty has so tied his power to\r\nagencies purely material that He can never perform an act except under\r\ntheir regulation? This would leave Him with no discretional power\r\nwhatever--with no such liberty even as that which He has bestowed upon\r\nevery creature that has will, or anything like it. Is this the idea of a\r\nGod infinite in power, as in wisdom and goodness? Are we to think that\r\nthe Almighty has just for once set a universe in motion, and forever\r\nwithdrawn Himself from all meddling with its affairs? He permits us to\r\ncontrol the electric power: but is never permitted to direct a\r\nthunderbolt upon the guilty, or to turn one aside from any path it might\r\nincline to pursue!\r\n\r\nMiracles! Is it then so much more wonderful that water should be turned\r\ninto wine, than that a little water and a little earth, under the rays\r\nof the sun, should be turned into the beautiful flowers and luscious\r\nfruits of our gardens and orchards? These same elements are even now\r\nmaturing gapes, which, with a little management, under merely natural\r\nforces, directed by a human will, may produce wine fit for the wedding\r\nfeast of a king.\r\n\r\nOr, in another line of thought, we may ask, Is it much more difficult to\r\ncall back a living soul and unite it again to its former body than in\r\nany way to produce that soul at first?\r\n\r\nThese and the like considerations apply to the subject of prayer, and\r\nthe special favors which it is believed to bring. We men are perpetually\r\nturning the forces of nature where we please, and for the most special\r\npurposes: can we for a moment imagine that the Almighty has less of this\r\npower of control than we?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER OF HON.

CON.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe succession of days and years and centuries is noted in calendars;\r\nbut it is great events, constituting historical epochs, that mark the\r\nprogress and destiny of our race. Decisive battles, vast reforms, civil\r\nor religious, great scientific discoveries or mechanical inventions,\r\ndynastic changes, political revolutions, the union or dismemberment of\r\nstates, the birth or death of republics, the rise or fall of\r\nempires--these are the deep notches in the groove of time, the mighty\r\nlandmarks in the pathway of humanity. It is the fate of the American\r\nUnion, involving the liberty of our country and mankind, that is to be\r\ndecided in our approaching Presidential election. How paltry are all\r\nparty questions in the presence of an issue so transcendent as this! How\r\ndare we mingle old party names or conflicts with such a question, when\r\nthe life of the Union is trembling in the balance! The maintenance of\r\nthe Union is the one majestic question, and the _Union party_, in name,\r\nand in fact, is the only one that should exist, until this great issue\r\nis decided. Then, when the Union is rescued from present and future\r\nperil, we may exhume the past, use old party names, or discuss old party\r\nissues, but until then to unfold a party banner, and revive old party\r\nprejudices, is treason to our country and mankind. It is not Democrats\r\nalone, or Republicans alone, as separate parties marshalled against each\r\nother, that can save the Union. During this straggle for the Union, we\r\ndo not hear of Democratic or Republican admirals or generals, divisions\r\nor regiments; no, we have only one great Union army, discarding all\r\nparty names or symbols, and fighting only for and under the banner of\r\nthe Union. It is then a grave objection to the Chicago McClellan\r\nConvention, that, in such a crisis as this, it summoned only a\r\n_Democratic_ Convention, and appealed only to the _Democratic_ party to\r\nsave the Government. As well might we summon only a Democratic army to\r\nfight the battles of our country, as conduct such an election as this\r\nunder any old party name and banner. Thousands of Republicans as well as\r\nDemocrats, together, under the banner of the Union, fight now the\r\nbattles of their country. Thousands of Republican as well as Democratic\r\nsoldiers sleep in their bloody shrouds, or lie wounded on beds of agony;\r\nbut who dare ask to what party they belonged? It was an unholy ambition,\r\nstimulated by party leaders, a thirst for office and emoluments, that\r\nrallied under an old party name at Chicago, when the whole people should\r\nhave been summoned to the rescue.\r\n\r\nAnd who met in council at Chicago? Was it the friends of the Union? No,\r\nit was Democrats, as they called themselves, whether unionists or\r\ndisunionists. Avowed disunionists constituted a large and influential\r\nportion of the Convention (profaning the name of Democrats) that met\r\ntogether at Chicago. Who were Vallandigham and Harris and Long and many\r\nother of their compeers, who not only met together at Chicago, but some\r\nof whom were received with shouts of applause, and resolutions moved by\r\nsome of them unanimously adopted. It was a meeting of loyal men and\r\ndisloyal, peace and war men, unionists and disunionists. Every\r\ndisunionist is a traitor. He is for the overthrow of the Republic, upon\r\nthe demand of rebels in arms against the Government. Every peace man now\r\non the Chicago McClellan platform is a disunionist and a traitor,\r\nbecause he knows, in his inmost soul, that no peace can be obtained but\r\nupon the ultimatum of Jefferson Davis, now officially proclaimed by him\r\nthrough the secretary of state to foreign Governments, namely, the\r\nseverance of the Union, and the establishment throughout the South of a\r\nseparate slave-holding empire. Most of these peace men openly avow their\r\ndisunion doctrines, while others attempt to conceal their treason, under\r\nthe transparent mask of an \"armistice,\" a \"cessation of hostilities,\"\r\nand an _ultimate_ \"convention of the States,\" ignominiously declaring,\r\nat the same time, by their platform resolutions at Chicago, that to\r\nsuppress the rebellion by war _has proved a failure_. What truly loyal\r\nman, by voting for their candidates, will indorse at the polls such a\r\nplatform as this? It is a surrender of our country's honor--it is a\r\ncapitulation, upon the demand of Southern traitors, whose hands are\r\ndripping with the warm life blood of our sons and brothers, and who now\r\nboldly and defiantly _pledge themselves_ to foreign Governments, as they\r\nalways had declared to us, that they will have no peace unless based\r\nupon disunion. Did a Democratic Convention ever before receive avowed\r\nDisunionists and traitors among its number? Did it ever before trail in\r\nthe dust the glorious flag of our country? Did it ever agree before,\r\nthat our banner should be torn down from half the States and territory\r\nof the Union, and replaced by a foreign standard, having upon it but one\r\nemblazonry--the divinity and perpetuity of Slavery? And shall we treat\r\nwith the Confederate authorities on this basis? No; while we will gladly\r\ntreat with States and people _desiring to return to the Union_, with\r\nJefferson Davis and his Cabinet brandishing over our heads the two-edged\r\nsword of Slavery and disunion, we will, in the emphatic words of General\r\nJackson, \"_negotiate only from the mouths of our cannon_.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Jackson was, in truth, the father and founder of the Democratic\r\nparty. Prior to his first nomination in 1823, in the election of\r\nJefferson, Madison, and Monroe, the parties were known as Federal and\r\nRepublican. In the fall of 1823, I united with a few friends in calling,\r\nat Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, the FIRST _Democratic_ meeting, by which\r\nGeneral Jackson was nominated as the Democratic candidate for the\r\nPresidency of the United States. I offered the resolutions in his favor\r\nadopted by that meeting, calling the Democratic State Convention of\r\nPennsylvania which confirmed that nomination in March, 1824. I attended\r\nthat Convention, as a delegate from Pittsburg, and wrote the address of\r\nthe Convention to the Democracy of the State and of the Union on that\r\nmomentous occasion. I supported General Jackson for the Presidency in\r\n1823 (my first vote), 1824, 1828, and 1832, and uniformly adhered to\r\nthe Democratic party until after the rebellion of 1861.\r\n\r\nDuring the great nullification and secession question of South Carolina,\r\non the first Monday of January, 1833, at Natchez, Mississippi, I made\r\nthe opening speech, then published, against nullification and secession,\r\nin favor of \"_war_,\" if necessary to maintain the Union--in favor of\r\n\"_coercion_\" to put down rebellion in any State. The Legislature of\r\nMississippi indorsed that speech, and passed resolutions declaring\r\nnullification and _secession_ to be _treason_, and, upon THAT ISSUE, I\r\nwas elected by the Legislature to the Senate of the United States. If\r\nMississippi, under the influence of Jefferson Davis, and other traitor\r\nleaders, has since that period abandoned those principles, she cannot\r\nexpect me to follow her, and thereby surrender opinions which I have\r\nuniformly maintained and advocated throughout my life, but more\r\nespecially from 1833 until the present period. Mississippi (whose\r\nprosperity I would restore by bringing her back to the Union) indorsed\r\nthose opinions when she elected me to the Senate of the United States\r\nover an avowed and distinguished secessionist (George Poindexter), after\r\na contest of unexampled violence, personal and political, extending from\r\nJanuary, 1833, to January, 1836.\r\n\r\nIt was on that occasion that General Jackson wrote his celebrated letter\r\nin favor of my election and sustaining my political course. It was after\r\nthe adoption of the secession ordinance by Carolina, that General\r\nJackson sent our war vessels to Charleston to hold and blockade the\r\nharbor, and our troops, under the illustrious Scott, to maintain, by\r\nforce, if necessary, the authority of the Federal Government over the\r\nforts commanding the city of Charleston. Let us suppose that the rebels\r\nhad then shot down our flag, captured our forts, made war upon the\r\nUnion, and proceeded to dissolve it by force--let us suppose that a\r\ncommittee from any convention had then dared to nominate General Jackson\r\nfor the Presidency upon such a platform as that adopted at Chicago,\r\nproposing an armistice and cessation of hostilities until a National\r\nConvention could be assembled, accompanied by the declaration that the\r\nrebellion could not be crushed by war, who doubts what would have been\r\nthe course of that devoted patriot? He would have stamped the\r\ndisgraceful and treasonable resolutions under his feet, and indignantly\r\nscouted the traitors who offered them. And now this McClellan Convention\r\nat Chicago professes to represent the Democratic party. As Jefferson was\r\nthe founder of the old _Republican_ party, Jackson was the father of the\r\n_Democratic_ party. Now, with perhaps one exception, is there a _single\r\nmember_ of that Convention (assuming the name of 'Democratic') that\r\n(like myself) supported General Jackson in 1823, 1824, 1828, and 1832,\r\nand uniformly adhered to the Democratic party until after the rebellion\r\nof 1861?\r\n\r\nWhat right had that Convention to assume the name of Democracy, while\r\ntrampling upon the advice of the founder of the party, and all its great\r\nand vital principles? How dare they offer an 'armistice' and 'the\r\ncessation of hostilities' to rebels in arms against their country,\r\nespecially when the so-called rebel government had again and again\r\ndeclared that they would negotiate upon no terms, except the\r\nacknowledgment of their independence, and the definitive dissolution of\r\nthe Union? But, above all, how dare they record the disgraceful and\r\ntreasonable falsehood, that the war to suppress the rebellion had\r\nfailed, and ask the freemen of America to indorse at the polls such a\r\ndeclaration?\r\n\r\nAnd has, indeed, all the blood of patriots shed in defence of the Union\r\nin this war, been poured out in vain? Ye patriot soldiers! now in the\r\nfield, say, are you unable or unwilling to suppress the rebellion? Say\r\nit not only in words, but answer the foul accusation by your votes in\r\nthe approaching Presidential election.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago McClellan Convention says that the war is a failure, and\r\nthat therefore there must be an armistice and a cessation of\r\nhostilities. Will not your answer at the polls be this: 'It is a foul\r\nand treasonable falsehood?'\r\n\r\nAnd is this war for the Union indeed a failure? Let our many and\r\nwell-fought battles upon the ocean and the land answer the question. Let\r\na country nearly as large as half of Europe, taken from the rebels since\r\nthe war commenced, respond. Let Shiloh, and Donelson, and Gettysburg and\r\nVicksburg, and Port Hudson, and New Orleans, and the Mississippi from\r\nits source to its mouth, answer. Why, this wretched calumny had scarcely\r\nbeen uttered by the McClellan Convention, when Sherman, the great\r\ncommander, and his army had washed out the accusation in the blood of\r\nthe vanquished, and unfolded our banner at Atlanta, the grand military\r\nstrategic centre of Georgia, never to be recalled. And while the shouts\r\nof the great victory in Georgia were still sounding in our ears,\r\nOppequan responded to the thunders of Atlanta, and the heroic Sheridan,\r\nafter a decided victory, was driving the rebel army from the valley of\r\nVirginia. Was Sherman's campaign from Memphis and Nashville to\r\nChattanooga, and from Chattanooga to Atlanta, a failure? Why, that\r\ncampaign is unsurpassed in history. Was Grant's Potomac advance a\r\nfailure? What, the hero of the great campaign of the West, terminating\r\nwith the capture of Vicksburg and its garrison, not know, or do his\r\nduty! Was the victory of the Wilderness a failure, or the destruction in\r\nsuccessive battles of one third of Lee's army, together with the seizure\r\nof the great Weldon Railroad, or the repulse there of the Confederate\r\nattack--were these failures? Recollect, Grant was Lieutenant-General,\r\nsubordinate only to the President and Secretary of War, in planning the\r\nwhole campaign, and, while too much credit cannot be given to the heroic\r\nSherman and noble Sheridan, and their gallant armies, yet, it must be\r\nremembered, that their great victories and strategic military movements\r\nare but a part of Grant's plan--_concentrating_ the three armies of the\r\nPotomac, the Shenandoah, and the West, so as to seize and hold all the\r\nroads connecting with Richmond, and capture the Confederate army and\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAnd now as to our navy. Were the gallant deeds of Admiral Porter at\r\nVicksburg, on the Mississippi River, the Arkansas, and the Red River,\r\nfailures? Were the destruction of the forts protecting New Orleans and\r\nthe capture of that city by the illustrious Farragut failures? Were the\r\ncapture or destruction by that gallant man, aided by General Granger, of\r\nthe forts commanding the Bay of Mobile, together with the occupation of\r\nits harbor by our fleet--and the destruction there of the Confederate\r\nnavy--were these failures? Were the capture of the forts and city of\r\nPensacola, of all the Florida forts, and the fortifications commanding\r\nSavannah--the defeat of the Merrimac and Tennessee--the destruction of\r\nthe Alabama--the capture of Port Royal, and of the forts which commanded\r\nit--were these failures? No; the war is not a failure. It is a glorious\r\nand trancendent success. Already the whole Southern and Southwestern\r\ncoast is ours. The whole of the Mississippi is ours, with far more than\r\na thousand miles of its course from Columbus to its mouth, and even to a\r\nconsiderable extent up the Mississippi and Missouri, which had been once\r\nin the hands of the enemy. Chesapeake Bay is ours, and all its\r\ntributaries, from the Potomac to the James River. The whole coast of\r\nNorth and South Carolina, of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana,\r\nand Texas, with vast portions of the interior, including many\r\nimpregnable positions, is ours. Tennessee, one of the seceded States, is\r\nnow wholly ours. Kentucky is loyal. Missouri is ours, and has abolished\r\nSlavery. Maryland is ours, and has, I believe, uprooted Slavery also.\r\nOur whole _Territorial_ domain, greater in extent than one half of\r\nEurope (and about Slavery in which this contest began), is now wholly\r\nours. Not a rebel flag floats within its limits. When before were such\r\nmighty conquests achieved within so short a period? Why, the conquests\r\nof Alexander, of Cæsar and Napoleon covered no such extent of territory.\r\nAnd, 'we take no steps backward.' Where our flag now is once unfolded in\r\nany part of rebeldom, there it continues to float, and will float\r\nforever. What are we to negotiate about? Is it as to giving up the\r\nMississippi and its tributaries, together with New Orleans, Vicksburg,\r\nand Tennessee? Is West Virginia, which has been admitted as a new Free\r\nState, to be surrendered? Are Fortress Monroe and the Chesapeake to be\r\nabandoned? Is the rebel flag to float at Alexandria, and on the heights\r\nof Arlington; and are rebel cannon to be planted there, in sight of and\r\nto command the _very capital of the Union_? Are we to insult loyal\r\nKentucky, Missouri, Maryland, and Delaware, by negotiating about them?\r\nAre we to give back Western to Eastern Virginia? Where is the line of\r\ndivision to be run, and what armies would be strong enough to maintain\r\npeace upon the border? What portion of the mighty Territories uniting us\r\nwith the Pacific are to be surrendered? Are we to turn over to the cruel\r\ndespotism of their bloody and relentless masters, the millions of loyal\r\npeople of the South, to whom we have given the most sacred pledge of the\r\nprotection of the Union? And, last of all, are the two millions of\r\nslaves, as Jefferson Davis complains, who have been emancipated by the\r\nconstitutional war proclamation of President Lincoln, are they to be\r\nremanded to Slavery, including the thousands who have so gallantly\r\nfought in our defence? And as to Slavery, or what, if any, may be left\r\nof it, when the war is over, are we to abandon the unquestionable right\r\nto abolish it, as Mr. Lincoln and his friends propose, by a\r\nconstitutional amendment? Is Jefferson Davis to come back again as\r\nSenator from Mississippi? Are the traitors Cobb and Thompson to take\r\ntheir places in the McClellan Cabinet? Is Toombs, of Georgia, (as he\r\nboasted) to call the roll of his slaves on the Boston Common? Slavery,\r\nwe know, was the sole cause of the war. It was Slavery that fired the\r\nfirst gun at Sumter, and demanded to rule or ruin the country. It was in\r\nthe name of Slavery that the South seceded; and it was to extend and\r\nperpetuate Slavery, as a blessed and divine institution, that they\r\navowedly framed the Confederate constitution. In the debates of Congress\r\nof 1860-'61, in the proceedings of the Committee of 1833, in the acts of\r\nthe Peace Congress, in the various secession ordinances, by the very\r\nterms of the Confederate constitution, Slavery was the sole cause of\r\nthis war upon the Government. Slavery was and is our great enemy, and\r\nshall we not destroy it? Slavery was the sole cause of the war, and\r\nshall it not be eradicated? When the patient calls for a physician, he\r\nseeks for the source of the disease, so as not merely to alleviate\r\npresent pain, but to remove the cause, and prevent relapses or\r\nsuccessive attacks. If he deals only with palliatives, to assuage for a\r\nbrief period the present suffering, when he can remove the cause, and\r\nrestore the patient to permanent and perfect health, he is but a quack\r\nand an impostor.\r\n\r\nThe party supporting Mr. Lincoln is composed of men of all the old\r\nparties. Its candidate for the Presidency is from the North, and\r\nbelonged to the late Republican party. Its candidate for the Vice\r\nPresidency, a brave, loyal, Union-loving man, is from the South, and\r\nbelonged (like myself) to the old Democratic party. But the Baltimore\r\nConvention, in the spirit of true nationality and patriotism, discarded\r\nall old party names or issues. It acted only in the name of the Union,\r\nand as one great Union party, and asked all patriots, dismissing for the\r\npresent all old party names or issues, to unite with it for the\r\nsalvation of the Union.\r\n\r\nMy first objection, then, to the organization against Mr. Lincoln is,\r\nthat it is a mere party organization, arrayed under an old party name,\r\nand marching under an old party banner. In the midst of a great contest\r\nlike this, when all old party names and prejudices should be forgotten,\r\nand when Democrats and Republicans should be united as brethren in the\r\none grand effort to suppress the rebellion, the Chicago McClellan\r\nConvention reopens old party strifes, renews old party issues, and,\r\ndenouncing Republicans, assumes the name and professes to represent the\r\nDemocratic party. It was the banner of the Union that was raised by the\r\nConvention at Baltimore, and the salvation of the Union, with its rescue\r\nfrom present and future perils, the suppression of the rebellion, with\r\nthe removal of the cause, constituted the only issues presented by that\r\nConvention to the people of the loyal States of all parties.\r\n\r\nIt was far otherwise at Chicago. It was a mere assemblage of partisans,\r\nsome for, and some against the Union, in the search of power and\r\nemoluments. It was the flag of the Union that was given to the breeze at\r\nBaltimore. It was the flag of a party that was unfolded at Chicago.\r\n'_For the Union_' was written on the flag of the one--'For the\r\nDemocratic party' was inscribed on the standard of the other. It was\r\nsaid that the Baltimore Convention has made the abolition of Slavery one\r\nof its issues; but, as well might it be objected that it had made the\r\nprosecution of the war, or the maintenance of the army or navy, part of\r\nits creed. The Emancipation Proclamation of the President had its whole\r\nconstitutional force as a _war measure_ TO SAVE THE UNION, and, as such,\r\nit was adopted by Mr. Lincoln as ex-officio 'commander-in-chief of the\r\narmy and navy of the United States.' That it was, as a war measure,\r\nperfectly constitutional, I have never doubted, and so declared in an\r\narticle published at the time in THE CONTINENTAL MAGAZINE. It is the\r\nduty of all persons, not aliens, to unite with the President in\r\nsuppressing a rebellion. Slaves, in the relation which they occupy to\r\nthe National Government under the Federal Constitution, are '_persons_.'\r\nAs _persons_, they are thrice named in the Constitution, and by no other\r\nname whatever. Especially, under the clause providing for direct\r\ntaxation, they are _enumerated_ as _persons_, not _valued_ as\r\n_property_. The term 'person' is used more frequently in the\r\nConstitution than any other, and it is applied expressly to slaves, and\r\nto the whole people of the United States, including the President and\r\nVice President, who are designated therein as persons. This very\r\nquestion, whether slaves are persons or property under the Constitution,\r\narose in the great case of _Groves_ vs. _Slaughter_, when, in 1841 (with\r\na single dissenting opinion, that of Judge Baldwin), after the fullest\r\nargument on both sides, it was unanimously decided by the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States that slaves, in the relation which they hold to the\r\nNational Government under the Federal Constitution, are _persons only_,\r\nand not _property_. Were it otherwise, Massachusetts could not forbid\r\nthe introduction of slaves from the South for sale there as merchandise;\r\nfor Massachusetts could not prohibit the introduction of the cotton or\r\nany property of the South for sale as merchandise within her limits, for\r\nthat would have been a prohibition of the _exports from State to State_,\r\nwhich is forbidden by the Federal Constitution. My own elaborate\r\nargument before the Court, as one of the counsel in that case, will be\r\nfound in the appendix to the first edition of the 15th volume of\r\nPeters's Reports. As _persons_, the President has a right to call for\r\nthe aid of all residing in the United States, except aliens, to\r\nsuppress the rebellion. He has a right to call for the services of the\r\nloyal or rebel masters for such a purpose, as well as for the service of\r\ntheir slaves.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be denied, that the masters, whether rebel or loyal, may be\r\ncalled and even forced by conscription into the army to suppress the\r\nrebellion. Would it not then be strange if the master could exempt his\r\nslaves from similar services? The only right of the master recognized by\r\nthe Constitution, is to the 'service or labor' of his slaves. But he has\r\na right equally strong to his own service or labor; yet both must yield\r\nto the paramount right of the Government to the services of both or\r\neither to suppress the rebellion. There is not a single word in the\r\nFederal Constitution which, either by inference or express declaration,\r\nexempts slaves, more than any other persons, from the call of the\r\nFederal Government to aid in suppressing a rebellion. Such is the\r\nconstruction given, by the South to the so-called Confederate\r\nconstitution, which is much more stringent than ours in that respect,\r\nfor it recognizes slaves as property; yet, the rebel authorities, the\r\nrebel congress and government, force slaves, even by conscription, to\r\nperform military duty--to dig the trenches--to make the earthworks--to\r\nerect the barracks and arsenals--to help to make the cannon, small arms,\r\nand powder, and vessels of war--to construct the fortifications--to\r\ntransport the provisions, munitions, and cannon for their armies,\r\ntogether with the tents and military equipage--to raise the food\r\nindispensable for the support of their military forces--and, of course,\r\nthey would, _if they dare_, put arms in their hands to meet us on the\r\nbattle field. It is clear, then, not as a confiscation of property\r\n(which is also constitutional under certain circumstances), but as\r\n_persons_, that we have a right to the service of the slaves as well as\r\nof their masters to suppress the rebellion. But it is only by\r\nemancipation (with compensation for loss of their services by loyal men)\r\nthat the slaves can be called into our army, and used to suppress the\r\nrebellion. A call by the President for the slaves to serve in our\r\narmies, to risk their lives and shed their blood for the Union,\r\naccompanied by the declaration that they were still slaves, and, upon\r\nthe termination of the war, such as survived would be restored to their\r\nmasters, with whom their wives and children must still remain in\r\nbondage, would be an atrocious crime, as well as the climax of all\r\nabsurdities. No; it is only by emancipation that the services of the\r\nslaves can or ought to be obtained for the suppression of the rebellion.\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation then of the President, with compensation\r\nto loyal masters, is most clearly constitutional during the continuance\r\nof the war, and as a war measure to suppress the rebellion and save the\r\nUnion, and such must be the decision of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates, to which tribunal the President has properly submitted the final\r\narbitrament of the constitutional question. It is true, when the\r\nrebellion is crushed, the President can issue no new emancipation\r\nproclamation. But neither can he then recall or modify the one already\r\nissued; and if he had the power to recall the proclamation, it would be\r\nan act of perfidy unparalleled in the history of the world. The nation\r\nwould be so utterly disgraced by such bad faith as would be involved in\r\nthe revocation of the Emancipation Proclamation, as to earn the contempt\r\nof all honest and honorable men, and the loss of sympathy of the\r\nindustrial classes and working men of Europe, whose rulers would then no\r\nlonger fear to recognize or aid the South. It was the magnificent\r\nuprising of the working classes of England in favor of the Union, that\r\nalone saved both countries from a bloody and disastrous war.\r\n\r\nThe Emancipation Proclamation being, as we have seen, clearly\r\nconstitutional, as a war measure, with a view to save the Union, was\r\nit, as such, wise and expedient? We have seen that the rebel South, even\r\nby conscription, when necessary, used slaves for military purposes, and\r\nthose not used directly in that way are required to raise breadstuff's\r\nand provisions (instead of cotton), to supply the Confederate army.\r\nIndeed the debates of Congress for many years past, will show that the\r\nSouth boasted, not vainly, of their great military strength, because\r\nthey declared that, while the slaves would be used in raising provisions\r\nto supply their forces, the whole white population capable of bearing\r\narms could then be called into the field. This constituted, as they\r\ndeclared, their _great military strength_. And is it not then a most\r\nimportant war measure, to deprive them of that all-powerful and\r\nefficient weapon: which, we have seen, can only be done by emancipation?\r\nNow, let us suppose that while we refuse the use of the colored race,\r\nwhether bond or free, in aid of the war, they are used for that purpose\r\nby the South, what would be the result? By the census of 1860, the whole\r\npopulation of the United States was 31,445,080, of which there were\r\nwhite, 26,975,575; free colored, 487,996; slaves, 3,953,760; total, of\r\ncolored, 4,441,756, of which there were in the seceded States 3,653,110,\r\nand in the loyal States, 788,446. Add the whites in the seceded States,\r\n5,449,463, would thus make the whole population of those States, by the\r\ncensus of 1860, 9,102,573. In the loyal States, the whole population was\r\n22,342,507; of which 21,553,861 were white, and 788,646 colored. Now\r\nthen, if the colored race, as we have seen, in the seceding States, are\r\nused for war purposes by them and not by us, the relative number of\r\nopposing forces would be as follows: Loyal States, 21,553,861; seceded\r\nStates, 9,102,573; difference in favor of the Loyal States, 12,451,288.\r\nNow, to begin the process, add to the whites in the Loyal States the\r\nfree colored, and the total number is 22,342,507; seceded States,\r\n9,102,573; difference in favor of the Loyal States, 13,239,934.\r\nContinuing the process, if we deduct by the emancipation policy the\r\nwhole colored population of the seceded States, the result would be,\r\nLoyal States, 22,342,507; seceded States, 5,449,463. But if, concluding\r\nthe process, by the emancipation policy we not only deduct the colored\r\nrace from the aid of the South, but add it in aid of the Loyal States,\r\nthe result would be, Loyal States, 25,995,617; seceded States,\r\n5,449,463; difference in favor of Loyal States, 20,456,154. Thus the\r\npolicy opposed to emancipation and to the use of the colored race by us\r\nin the war, mates the difference in our favor as against the South only\r\n12,451,288, whereas the difference in our favor by the emancipation\r\npolicy of the President is 20,546,154. Deduct from this the above\r\n12,451,288; final difference, 8,094,866. Thus we see that, by the\r\nPresident's policy, there is, in effect, a gain to the Loyal States\r\nequivalent to more than eight millions of people, more than 200,000 of\r\nwhom are already soldiers in the Union army, all of whom must be\r\ndisbanded if Mr. Lincoln's policy was erroneous. Will any say that a\r\npolicy which makes a difference in the relative forces of the two\r\ncontending parties of more than eight millions of people in favor of the\r\nNorth, and which has already increased our army 200,000, is not a most\r\nimportant war measure, aiding us to suppress the rebellion and save the\r\nGovernment? and, therefore, it is a policy eminently calculated to\r\npreserve and perpetuate the Union. Indeed, it is this measure which\r\nrenders the maintenance of the Union certain, and, without it, the Union\r\nis subjected to great peril.\r\n\r\nAs, then, the emancipation policy of the President is not only wise,\r\nbeneficent, and constitutional, but renders certain the preservation of\r\nthe Union, while that of his opponents subjects it to imminent peril, I\r\ngo for the reëlection of Mr. Lincoln. I go for him as a _Union man_,\r\nand because his emancipation policy will certainly save the Union; and I\r\ngo against his opponent, because, however loyal he may be, and however\r\nsincere his desire to save the Union, practically he is a disunionist,\r\nbecause, independent of the Chicago McClellan platform, his\r\nanti-emancipation and anti-negro policy subjects the Union to imminent\r\nperil. Now, with me, in this, as in all preceding elections, the\r\npreservation and perpetuation of the Union constituted the great\r\ntranscendent question, involving the liberty of our country and mankind,\r\nand I can give no vote which subjects it to the slightest peril. Save\r\nthe Union, and all else will be added in time (including the _ultimate_\r\ndownfall of Slavery, which I predicted and advocated in January, 1844),\r\nhas been the doctrine of my life. To that doctrine I still adhere, but\r\nsupport the President's emancipation policy _now_, because it is the\r\nmost efficient, if not the only means of saving and perpetuating the\r\nUnion. I opposed emancipation when it was unconstitutional as a _peace\r\nmeasure_, and because I knew it would cause civil war, invite foreign\r\nintervention, and endanger the Union. I support emancipation now,\r\nbecause it is constitutional as a war measure, greatly diminishes the\r\ndanger of foreign intervention, and insures the maintenance and\r\nperpetuity of the Union. I supported Judge Douglas and opposed the\r\nelection of Mr. Lincoln in 1860, because I believed it would imperil the\r\nUnion. While always denying that his election would justify disunion, I\r\nfeared that the rebellion would be the result. In voting against Mr.\r\nLincoln in 1860, I did so to save the Union from peril. In voting for\r\nhim now, it is to suppress the rebellion and maintain the Union. It is\r\nnot for Mr. Lincoln as a man (however worthy he may be), that I now\r\nvote--I vote for principles--I vote for the Union--and in supporting\r\nhim, I vote for the best, if not the only means to maintain and\r\nperpetuate the Union.\r\n\r\nBut there is another principle of vital importance involved in this\r\nelection. The South, under the banner of Slavery, proceeded to secede\r\nfrom the Union, immediately after the result of the Presidential\r\nelection of 1860 was made known. South Carolina seceded in December,\r\n1860. Mississippi followed early in January, 1861, and the Cotton States\r\nall followed during that and the succeeding month of February. Now, Mr.\r\nLincoln was not and could not be inaugurated as President until March,\r\n1861. The South did not and would not wait for his inaugural address of\r\nthat date to know, under the new condition of affairs, what would be the\r\npolicy of his Administration. They did not and would not wait for any\r\nmeasures of his Administration, much less any act of the Government or\r\nof Congress, but proceeded to secede merely because Mr. Lincoln had been\r\nconstitutionally elected to the Presidency by the people of the United\r\nStates. Such an act was an overthrow of the great fundamental principle\r\nof all free government, namely, that the majority shall govern under the\r\nforms of the Constitution. It was an attack upon the right of suffrage,\r\nan assault upon the ballot box and the great principle of an elective\r\nPresident, as provided in our Constitution, and which lies at the very\r\nbasis of free institutions. That principle is the vital element of our\r\nexistence. It is 'the casing air' of liberty. Take it away, and freedom\r\ninstantly expires. The right of suffrage is the great American right of\r\nevery citizen, rich or poor, humble or exalted. It is the great\r\npalladium of our liberty. It is a Government, like a mighty pyramid,\r\nreposing on its broad and immovable base, the will and affections of the\r\npeople. It is the people's Government, and therefore the people maintain\r\nit, and with us two millions of volunteers have rushed to its support.\r\nTherefore, while it is the best Government in peace, it is the strongest\r\nin war. But secession because of the election of a President, is not\r\nonly war upon the Union, but war upon the elective franchise, the great\r\nfundamental principle of free government, and without which it is but a\r\nfleeting shadow. Democrats--people of all parties--my countrymen, while\r\nyou are asked now by the Chicago Convention to vote against Mr. Lincoln,\r\nyou would nullify by that very vote the right of suffrage, because, what\r\nis that suffrage worth, what is your vote but an empty form, if it may\r\nnot elect your President? But if, because the minority who have voted\r\nagainst you, dissatisfied with your choice, can rebel, make war upon\r\nyou, because you thus voted, and set up another President for that\r\nminority by force of arms, what is that but to say that the majority\r\nshall not rule; that the right of suffrage shall be nullified; that the\r\nConstitution, under which that vote was given, shall be overthrown? This\r\nis what the rebellion has done in attempting to destroy the Republic,\r\nmerely because of the election of Mr. Lincoln. This arrogant and\r\ninsolent slave-holding oligarchy would not even wait to hear what the\r\nPresident of your choice would say. They treated the President of your\r\nchoice, and therefore they treated you and the Constitution under which\r\nyou acted, with scorn and defiance. So long as you would act with them,\r\nso long as the Northern parasites would adhere to the Southern upas tree\r\nof Slavery, so long as the 'mudsills' of the North, as they arrogantly\r\ncalled you, would obey the orders of their Southern masters, so long as\r\nyou would be their slaves, they would permit the President to be\r\ninaugurated. But so soon as you elected a President against their\r\ndictation, then your suffrages should be nullified by the rebellion of a\r\nminority against the majority. What is this but to say, that the\r\nmajority shall not elect a President, and thus render the right of\r\nsuffrage an empty form, striking at the fundamental principle of free\r\ngovernment, and substituting the _bayonets_ of the minority for the\r\n_ballots_ of the majority of the people? Freemen of America, is it\r\npossible that by voting against Mr. Lincoln now because of the Southern\r\nrebellion, you will thus declare that the election of a President by the\r\npeople is not to be maintained, but that his reëlection is to be\r\ndefeated, and that his authority, as your President and as your\r\nrepresentative, is therefore never to extend over the _whole United\r\nStates_, because a rebellious minority oppose it by force of arms? This\r\nis one of the transcendent issues involved in this contest. It is in\r\nfact the great question whether the majority shall rule or the\r\nminority--whether self-government is an unreal mockery, or whether it is\r\nindeed a God-given right of _man_, born in the image of his Maker. You\r\nvoted that Mr. Lincoln should be President of the _whole United States_.\r\nThat was your decision at the ballot box. Has it been obeyed? No: an\r\narrogant slave-holding minority has rebelled against it, and, within the\r\nboundaries of the area occupied by that minority, has suppressed your\r\nelection by the bayonet, and substituted Jefferson Davis, one of the\r\nrebel leaders, in place of Abraham Lincoln. Within the limits of that\r\nrebellion, the power, under the Constitution, which you devolved upon\r\nAbraham Lincoln, has been nullified by force of arms, and now, if you\r\nabandon the war, or defeat his reëlection, your choice will have been\r\nnullified, and he never will have exercised throughout the United States\r\nthe power given to him by your suffrages under the Constitution. Now the\r\nparty in the North thus acquiescing in this destruction of the right of\r\nsuffrage, dares to assume the sacred name of Democracy, which you know\r\nis but Anglicized Greek, meaning the _power of the people_. Shade of the\r\nimmortal Jackson! the father and founder of the Democratic party, burst\r\nthe cerements of the Hermitage, and blast with the thunders of New\r\nOrleans the wretched traitors who thus dare to profane the sacred name\r\nunder which you were chosen President of the United States.\r\n\r\nBut there is another grave objection to the McClellan platform adopted\r\nat Chicago. It is its _intentional ambiguity_. The Convention was\r\ncomposed of unionists and disunionists, of peace and war Democrats, as\r\nthey style themselves, and the platform was adapted to suit the views of\r\nboth these parties in and out of the Convention. It was a platform upon\r\nwhich the temple of Janus was to be closed, but with side doors at\r\neither extremity, into one of which the peace men with their olive\r\nbranches should enter, and the war men in full military array in the\r\nother, and the lion and the lamb meet together in the centre in cordial\r\nagreement. But, it appears that the war men in this case were only asses\r\nin lions' skins, for in the compromise between antagonistic principles\r\nand candidates, the peace men got far the better of the bargain. While\r\nthere were some vague and glittering generalities in favor of the Union,\r\nthey were connected with conditions which rendered the destruction of\r\nthe Union certain, namely, an armistice and cessation of hostilities,\r\naccompanied by the false and flagitious declaration, calculated to\r\nencourage the enemies of our country at home and abroad, namely, that\r\nthe war to suppress the rebellion was a failure. Remember, soldiers,\r\nthat the McClellan platform declares that your battles are failures;\r\nthat your blood has been shed in vain; that your arms can never crush\r\nthe rebellion; that you are inferior in courage to the slave-holding\r\nrebels; that you must admit your defeat, throw down your muskets, return\r\nin disgrace to your homes, disband the army, lay up the navy, recall\r\nGenerals Grant, Sherman, Sheridan, Meade, and Gilmore, and Admirals\r\nFarragut, Porter, Dupont, Davis, and Winslow, and leave it to the\r\ncivilians of Chicago, Vallandigham, Harris, Long, PENDLETON, and others,\r\nto negotiate a peace.\r\n\r\nNow what is an armistice? It is defined to be a suspension of the war\r\nfor a limited period. There may be conditions added, but none are named\r\nin the McClellan Chicago platform. Of course, then, it means a cessation\r\nof hostilities by land and sea. Indeed, the platform is weaker than\r\nthis, for it proposes directly a 'cessation of hostilities,' not by land\r\nonly, or by sea only, but, of course, by _both, as the words are\r\ngeneral_. Now then, the blockade of the rebel ports, and the capture or\r\ndestruction of blockade runners and their cargoes, is war upon the\r\nocean. This blockade, then, is to be abandoned during the armistice, for\r\nthere is to be a cessation of hostilities upon the ocean and the land.\r\n\r\nDuring this interval of peace, when there is to be no blockade of the\r\nSouthern ports, what is to follow? By their own accounts and estimates,\r\nthe Confederates have within their limits, in cotton (at present\r\nprices), tobacco, and naval stores, a value exceeding one billion of\r\ndollars in gold. Now then, so soon as the armistice was agreed upon, the\r\nwar upon the ocean, including the blockade, having ceased, the whole of\r\nthis cotton, tobacco, and naval stores, would be shipped to Europe, or\r\npartly to Nassau, on the way to Europe, and this enormous amount\r\nrealized by the Confederate government in gold. We know what tremendous\r\ndisasters have been produced by the cotton famine in England, France,\r\nand other countries. Now, the first effect of such shipments would be\r\nthe total ruin of all our manufactures of cotton and other textile\r\nfabrics. But another still more serious result would follow. We know\r\nthat Louis Napoleon is the bitter enemy of the Union; we know that he\r\nhas again and again declared that we could not suppress the rebellion;\r\nthat he has earnestly thrice endeavored to persuade the British\r\nGovernment to unite with him in acknowledging the independence of the\r\nSouth--twice through efforts made directly upon the British Cabinet, and\r\nonce through Roebuck and Lindsay, members of the House of Commons, to\r\ninduce it by a parliamentary vote to compel the British Ministry to\r\nunite with the Emperor in acknowledging the independence of the South.\r\nThat Louis Napoleon is our bitter enemy, is proved also by the\r\nFrench-Mexican war, in which England, and even Spain, separated from\r\nhim. It is proved also by the diplomatic correspondence of Jefferson\r\nDavis, and by his friendly and approving recognition of the\r\nestablishment of the French Imperial Government in Mexico. It is further\r\nproved by Louis Napoleon's own letter, in which he declared, that one of\r\nthe objects of the Mexican war was the establishment of the equilibrium\r\nof the Latin race upon the American continent. It is farther\r\ndemonstrated by the proceedings of the French in Mexico, and especially\r\nrecently at Matamoras, in the mutual aid given and received by the\r\nFrench and Confederate forces. Now, what is the meaning of establishing\r\nthe equilibrium of the Latin race on the '_American continent_'? In the\r\nfirst place, it means European military intervention; in the second\r\nplace, it means to embrace not only Mexico, _but the whole Latin race on\r\nthe American continent_. By the Latin race is included all Spanish\r\nAmerica. It means, then, in the future, if our Government is overthrown,\r\nthat all Spanish America, from the northern boundary of Mexico to Cape\r\nHorn, is to be consolidated into one great Power under imperial sway. It\r\nmeans to include in this vast empire the command of the Isthmus of\r\nTehauntepec, the route by Central America (about which Louis Napoleon\r\nhas written so much), by Honduras and Chiriqui, but more especially the\r\nPanama, as also the Atrato routes.\r\n\r\nIn the great future, whoever commands these routes, especially together\r\nwith that of the Isthmus of Suez, which I visited a few months since,\r\nand which Louis Napoleon has nearly completed, will command the commerce\r\nof the world, and, as a consequence, ultimately control the institutions\r\nof the world. Such are the tremendous problems teeming in the brain of\r\nNapoleon the Third, and all, as he believes, depending upon the\r\ndestruction of the American Union. I speak of what I know from a\r\nresidence now of nearly two years in Europe. Thus it is that Louis\r\nNapoleon intends to bring us within the centrifugal gravitation of the\r\nEuropean balance of power. This wonderful man proposes to extend this\r\nsystem from the old continents to the new, embracing both, and thus hold\r\nin his grasp the equilibrium--the balance of power of the world. We may\r\nwell imagine what that equilibrium will be when Napoleon the Third shall\r\nhold the balance in his hands. Already he has considerable possessions\r\n(insular and continental) in North and South America, and Mexico, under\r\nMaximilian, is substantially a French dependency. He holds Algiers. He\r\nis colonizing Egypt (as I myself saw this year) by his railroads and\r\ncanals. He has seized and colonized Cochin China and Annam. He has made\r\nItaly a dependency on the bayonets of Franco. Now then, under these\r\ncircumstances, when the blockade shall have terminated, and Jefferson\r\nDavis, who is quite as ambitious and even more talented than Louis\r\nNapoleon, shall hold in his hand more than a billion of dollars' worth\r\nof Southern products ready for immediate shipment, may he not, and will\r\nhe not say, through his most able and adroit diplomatic representative\r\nat Paris, 'Recognize the independence of the South, and all these\r\nproducts shall be shipped for sale in France, and to French\r\nmanufacturers,' and thus enable France to crush for the present the\r\ncotton manufacturers of all the rest of the world. It is well known in\r\nParis that Mr. Slidell is upon terms of the most intimate association\r\nwith Louis Napoleon, and has thoroughly convinced him that we cannot\r\nsuppress the rebellion. Is it not, then, clear, anxious as Napoleon is\r\nfor the success of the South, that he would, in the event of McClellan's\r\nelection, at once recognize Southern independence. Indeed, it is the\r\nboast of the Confederate leaders in Europe, since the adoption of the\r\nplatform at Chicago, that, upon the election of their candidates,\r\nwithout waiting four months for the inauguration in March next, Napoleon\r\nwill AT ONCE recognize the Confederate government. Indeed, I do not\r\ndoubt, from the circumstantial evidence (although I do not know the\r\nfact), that there is already a secret understanding between Jefferson\r\nDavis and Napoleon the Third to recognize the independence of the South\r\nupon the election of the Chicago candidates. Why wait four months, until\r\nthe 4th of March next, when the American people, by indorsing the\r\nChicago platform, shall have declared for peace, with the additional\r\nannouncement in that platform, that the war for the suppression of the\r\nrebellion has failed?\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, that war has failed, and we cannot thus suppress the\r\nrebellion, it would not only be the right, but, upon the principles of\r\ninternational law, the duty of every foreign power to acknowledge\r\nSouthern independence. Thus is it that the Chicago McClellan platform\r\ninvites recognition. What is the meaning of the recognition of the\r\nindependence of the South by France, under such circumstances? IT MEANS\r\nWAR. It means, in the first place, commercial treaties stipulating great\r\nadvantages in favor of France, and perhaps other Powers. It means, of\r\ncourse, the overthrow of the blockade, so as to carry out those\r\ntreaties. It means conditions destructive of our interests, and\r\nfavorable to the recognizing POWERS. It means advantages and\r\ndiscriminations in tariffs and tonnage duties, and navigation\r\nprivileges, which would exclude us from Southern ports, including New\r\nOrleans and the mouth of the Mississippi, and deprive us of the markets\r\nof the South. Such a recognition, then, with its attendant consequences,\r\nmeans war--war not only with France, but probably with England and\r\nSpain, and other Powers. Doubtless, upon the election of the Chicago\r\ncandidates, Napoleon would again ask the Ministry of England to unite\r\nwith him in recognizing the independence of the South, and to\r\nparticipate in the benefits of the proposed commercial treaties. Who can\r\nsay that England, under the dangers and sacrifices incurred by a\r\nrefusal, would again decline the offer?\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that the election of the Chicago candidates involves\r\nthe most imminent peril of war with France, if not with England, both\r\nacting then in alliance with the Confederate government. That my country\r\neven then would accept the contest rather than the dishonor and ruin of\r\ndisunion, I do believe; but who can predict the result of such a\r\nconflict? My countrymen, we are speedily approaching the very edge of a\r\ndark and perilous abyss, into which we may be soon plunged by the\r\nelection of the Chicago candidates; I implore you not to make the dread\r\nexperiment. You must know that there will be no recognition of the\r\nindependence of the South by France or England, or any other Power, if\r\nAbraham Lincoln should be reëlected in November next. The American\r\npeople will then have loudly proclaimed, through the ballot box, that\r\nthey can and will subdue the rebellion by force of arms; and that they\r\nwill continue to negotiate from the mouths of our cannon, until the\r\nSouthern armies shall have been dispersed and vanquished. Upon the news\r\nof the reëlection of Mr. Lincoln reaching Europe, the Confederate stock,\r\nnow waiting the success of the Chicago candidates, will fall, like\r\nLucifer, to rise no more. American securities, including those of the\r\nFederal and loyal State Governments, of railroads, and other companies\r\nwith real capital, will all be immensely appreciated. The difference in\r\nfavor of our country, including the rise in greenbacks, would be\r\nequivalent in a few months to hundreds of millions of dollars. Nor is it\r\nonly our stocks that will rise at home and abroad, but the national\r\ncharacter will be immensely exalted. The friends of our country and\r\nliberty in Europe, including the grand mass of the people, will echo\r\nback the exultant shouts of freedom as they roll on from the Pacific to\r\nthe Mississippi, from the Mississippi to the lakes, and, bounding from\r\nthe glad Atlantic, are carried by steam and lightning to the shores of\r\nEurope. The fetters of American Slavery will be broken by such a result,\r\nand man--immortal man, of whatever race or color, born in the image of\r\nhis Maker, will emerge from chatteldom, and rise to the dignity of our\r\ncommon humanity.\r\n\r\nThere is one point still remaining of vast importance. It is the\r\nquestion of Slavery, so far as it yet lingers within our borders.\r\nWithout entering upon other aspects of that case, we call attention to\r\nthe proposed amendment for the purpose of abolishing Slavery on the\r\nrecommendation of Congress and the ratification of three fourths of the\r\nStates, as provided in the Federal Constitution. This is recommended by\r\nMr. Lincoln, and it is a plank in the Baltimore platform. It passed the\r\nSenate by a more than two-thirds vote, but was defeated, _by the\r\nDemocrats_, by a vote of 69 to 94, in the House, thus failing to receive\r\nthe two-thirds majority of both Houses of Congress as required by the\r\nConstitution. If, as has been heretofore shown, Slavery is the great\r\nenemy of the Union, and was the sole cause of the rebellion, why not\r\nextirpate the _cause_ of the war? Why not remove what may remain of\r\nSlavery after the war is ended, by the proposed amendment, as\r\nrecommended by Mr. Lincoln? This is a war and a Union measure,\r\ncalculated to crush the rebellion, to maintain the Union, and to prevent\r\nany future effort to effect its overthrow. This measure, which would\r\nsettle finally and forever the Slavery question, will succeed at an\r\nearly period, if Mr. Lincoln should be reflected. But this measure the\r\nDemocrats oppose, and desire to _keep open_ the Slavery question, for no\r\nobject that can be perceived, except to renew the old party alliance\r\nbetween Slavery South and its Northern supporters, with a view to party\r\ntriumphs. If General McClellan succeeds, Slavery, so far as it still\r\nexists, will be cherished, maintained, and perpetuated. The viper will\r\nbe warmed into life again, and although it might perhaps recoil for the\r\npresent, it would only be to strike at some future period with greater\r\nforce and venom at the life of the Republic. These men tell us they are\r\nfor the _Union as it was_. Are they for the revival of such scenes as\r\nwere perpetrated by Brooks in the American Senate? Are they for the\r\nKansas frauds and murders and forgeries, including the forgery of a\r\nconstitution? Are they for the right of secession, or, while they\r\ndispute the right of a State to secede, do they deny with Buchanan and\r\nPendleton the right of the Government to prevent its secession? Are they\r\nagainst secession, but against coercion also? Are they against\r\nrebellion, but opposed to its overthrow by force! Throughout the South,\r\nunder the Union as it was, there was no freedom of speech or of the\r\npress, on any question connected with Slavery. Are they for the sale,\r\nunder the Union as it was, even of free negroes into perpetual bondage?\r\nAre they for the denial of the rights of Northern citizens throughout\r\nthe South? Above all, are they for the renewal of the African slave\r\ntrade, as notoriously occurred in 1859 (during the Administration of\r\nBuchanan), at Savannah, in Georgia, when the wretched victims, just\r\nstolen from their native homes in Africa, were carried to Savannah, and\r\nthere, in defiance of the Federal Constitution, openly distributed by\r\nsale among the boasted chivalry of the South? If the Chicago candidates\r\nand their party are for these things--if they are for the Union as it\r\nwas in these respects, I am against them. I am for the Union (as clearly\r\nintended by the fathers and founders of the Government) as it will be\r\nwhen Slavery (its great, and, in fact, its only domestic foe) shall\r\nhave been entirely extinguished. While I am for the extinction of\r\nSlavery as a Union and as a war measure, I am consoled by the reflection\r\nthat, while it will secure the perpetuity of the Union, it will vastly\r\nincrease our wealth and power, and advance all our industrial and\r\nmaterial interests. For several years past I have examined this\r\nquestion, and, in various essays, published at home, but more especially\r\nabroad, have proved by official statistics, from the censuses of 1850\r\nand 1860, that, under the system of free labor and free schools which\r\nexist in the North, as compared with the South, the product of the Free\r\nStates is $217 _per capita_, and that of the slave-holding States $96\r\n_per capita_. Also, that the lands of the South are worth $10 per acre,\r\nand of the North $25 per acre. It was further proved by me, in those\r\nessays, by the same official data, that, exactly in proportion to the\r\nnumber of slaves is the decreased production _per capita_ in the Slave\r\nStates; that of South Carolina, with 402,406 slaves and 291,388 whites,\r\nbeing $66 _per capita_, and of Delaware, with 90,589 whites and 1,798\r\nslaves, being $143 _per capita_; while that of Massachusetts, with her\r\nsterile soil and severe climate, and far inferior natural advantages,\r\nwas $235 _per capita_; and the same rule was also shown to hold in\r\ncounties of the same Slave States, those counties with few slaves always\r\nproducing more _per capita_ than those having many. The result was, as\r\nshown by the census, that if the production of the South in 1859 had\r\nbeen equal _per capita_ during the same year to that of the Free States,\r\nthe additional value of the Southern products would have been\r\n$1,531,631,000 in 1859, and in the aggregate of the decade from 1859 to\r\n1869, $17,873,539,511, exclusive of the addition from the annual\r\nreinvestment of capital. The addition, then, to the value of the\r\nproducts of the South in a single year, caused by the substitution of\r\nfree for slave labor, would be nearly equal to our whole present\r\nnational debt, while in the aggregate of the ten years succeeding it\r\nwould be nearly ten times greater than the whole national debt, thus\r\nleaving us far richer after the next census, as a consequence of\r\nincreased production, notwithstanding the national debt, than if the\r\nrebellion had never occurred. Thus is it that the ways of Providence are\r\njustified to man, and that Slavery chastises its own advocates, while\r\nits overthrow brings increased wealth and safety and honor and happiness\r\nand prosperity to the country. While I do not advocate, then, the\r\nabolition of Slavery in defiance of the Constitution, because it would\r\nmake us more wealthy and powerful, more honored, happy, and prosperous,\r\nyet I rejoice that in supporting emancipation, as Mr. Lincoln does, as a\r\nUnion and as a war measure, the overthrow of this accursed institution\r\nwill be attended with countless benefits to my country and mankind.\r\nSuppress the rebellion by the overthrow of the Southern armies, and\r\nre-establish the Government throughout all our wide domain upon the\r\nbroad and eternal foundations of freedom, truth, and justice, then\r\nneither domestic traitors nor foreign despots will ever dash against its\r\nadamantine base. There it will stand, and stand forever, the mighty\r\ncontinental breakwater between the continents of Asia and of Europe,\r\nagainst which the breakers of internal faction, and the waves of\r\ndespotic power would dash in vain. To that home of the oppressed, to\r\nthat asylum of genuine and universal freedom, millions from the Old\r\nWorld would then come, and unite with us in strengthening and\r\nmaintaining a Government based upon the rights of humanity, and\r\nsustained by the affections of the people. While our physical force and\r\naccumulating wealth would thus be rapidly and vastly augmented, our\r\nmoral power would be increased in a still grander ratio. Then the cry of\r\ntyrants, that self-government is a phantom, and republics a failure,\r\nwould cease to oppress the listening ear of humanity. Then the chains\r\nwould soon fall everywhere from the limbs of the slave. Then the\r\nreactionary and feudal party of Europe, now so loudly proclaiming\r\nrepublics a failure, while exulting over the anticipated fall of the\r\nAmerican Union, would retire discomfited from the contest, while the\r\nrights of man would be immensely promoted, and civilization advance, at\r\na single bound, more than in the lapse of many centuries. The great\r\nliberal party of England, headed by those immortal champions Bright and\r\nCobden, would rouse like giants refreshed from their slumber, and carry\r\nthe flag of the vote by ballot and extended suffrage triumphantly\r\nthroughout the British realm, while Ireland, oppressed Ireland, would\r\nthen receive the fullest justice. Then, indeed, all past differences\r\nbetween England and America would be sunk forever in fraternal concord,\r\nand the peace of the world be maintained. Then Napoleon the Third, who\r\nkeeps an army of 600,000 men as a standing menace to Europe and the\r\nworld, and who has just, for the present, and for the present only,\r\nextinguished in blood the freedom of Mexico, must abandon his ambitious\r\nprojects, or shiver his diadem upon the adamantine rock of popular\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nBut there are complaints from the so-called Democratic party that the\r\nPresident, and especially the Secretary of State, have surrendered the\r\nMonroe doctrine, and abandoned Mexico to her fate. There is no truth in\r\nthis accusation. The President and the Secretary of State, _as regards\r\nthe future_, are wholly uncommitted on this question, unless, indeed, it\r\nbe for Mexico, by announcing that the people of the loyal States are\r\nunanimously in her favor. I say they are uncommitted for the future, and\r\nthe real objection to their course is this: that they have not gratified\r\nthe South and its Northern allies, by engaging, ere this, in a war with\r\nFrance, so as to bring her vast forces in aid of the Confederate\r\ngovernment. Indeed, Mr. Seward is cursed everywhere by the Confederates\r\nand their allies throughout Europe for preventing a war, _at this time_,\r\non the Mexican question, between France and the United States, 'There is\r\na time for all things,' and, as I have said before, our only question\r\n_now_, is the salvation of the Union; and when that is secured, will be\r\nthe proper period to consider other subordinate questions, foreign or\r\ndomestic. No man can speak with more feeling on this question than\r\nmyself, for it is a well-known fact that I earnestly opposed, as a\r\nmember of the Cabinet of Mr. Polk, the Mexican treaty of 1848, among\r\nother reasons, upon the suggestion then made by me, that if we abandoned\r\nMexico, it would subject us to the danger of European interference there\r\n(just as it has occurred) by force of arms. That treaty was carried by a\r\nconstitutional majority of only three votes, mainly through the\r\ninstrumentality of Mr. Calhoun, who was against the invasion of Mexico,\r\nand for 'masterly inactivity,' resting on the banks of the Rio Grande,\r\nbecause he knew (as declared in my Texas letter of January, 1844)\r\n'Slavery never could cross the Rio Grande,' and that, as a consequence,\r\nall of Mexico which we would permanently hold, as we ought to have done,\r\nfrom Texas to Tehuantepec, would, Mexico having abolished Slavery, have\r\nbecome Free States. I believed also that the permanent occupation and\r\nannexation of Mexico would have forever settled all the dangers of the\r\nSlavery question, because it would have flanked the Slave States of the\r\nSouthwest, by many powerful Free States adjacent on the Southwest,\r\ncontaining already seven millions of people, most of whom were of the\r\ncolored race, and who would have fought to the last against the\r\nreëstablishment of Slavery.\r\n\r\nYet, strong and decided as is my opposition to the course of Napoleon on\r\nthe Mexican as well as the Confederate question, I believe that the\r\npolicy of Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward on this question has been marked by\r\ngreat courage, devoted patriotism, and the highest statesmanship. I am\r\nnot for mingling this or any other question of foreign or domestic\r\npolicy with the maintenance of the Union, but have only answered the\r\nassaults of adversaries on the Mexican and other subordinate issues.\r\nThis, however, I must say: that the treaty with Mexico, by which we\r\nabandoned that country, having been ratified, I am opposed to any\r\nviolation of its provisions. While I adhere to the opinions expressed at\r\nthe time by me against that treaty; while I am opposed to forcing Mexico\r\ninto our Union, I believe that Napoleon the Third, unwittingly, by his\r\ninvasion, has caused Mexico soon to gravitate, by the overwhelming wish\r\nof her people, into the arms of the great Republic. Thus is it that the\r\nFrench invasion will have settled forever in our favor the question of\r\nthe American equilibrium.\r\n\r\nI have published the views expressed in these letters on consultation\r\nwith no one. They are my own individual opinions, and I only am\r\nresponsible for them. It is quite possible that the Administration may\r\ndiffer from some of them, but I am just as independent of the\r\nAdministration as they are of me. I am not, and never was, a Republican\r\nof 1856 or 1860, and while I have been falsely charged in Europe with\r\nabandoning my free-trade principles, in consequence of the constant and\r\nearnest support given by me to Mr. Lincoln, it must be remembered that a\r\nmajority of his Cabinet of 1863 had been Democrats, and supported the\r\nTariff of 1846. But the Tariff is a very subordinate question, compared\r\nwith the salvation of the Union. Besides, if the Tariff of 1846 was\r\nchanged, it was not until the 2d of March, 1861, and the change was\r\ncaused intentionally, by the previous withdrawal of the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives of the seceded States from both Houses of Congress.\r\n\r\nI have another answer to this charge. I was for the _free list_ of the\r\nTariff of 1842, as distinctly stated in my first annual Treasury report,\r\nso as to increase our exports, especially of dyed cotton goods, thereby\r\nproducing a corresponding augmentation of our imports and revenue. That\r\nportion of the act of 1846 was defeated by Mr. Calhoun, much to my\r\nregret, injury, and annoyance.\r\n\r\nBesides, the South, by its rebellion, and by thus forcing on us an\r\nenormous Federal debt, has rendered impossible for many years any other\r\nTariff but that which will bring the largest revenue. Until this debt is\r\npaid, we must have the highest Tariff for revenue, and it can be so\r\narranged as, while yielding, when the Union is restored, at least\r\n$150,000,000 annually in gold, at the same time to furnish all\r\nincidental aid to American industry that could be desired.\r\n\r\nI have thus far discussed the question as confined to the contest\r\nbetween the respective candidates for the Presidency of the United\r\nStates. But let those who think of supporting General McClellan for the\r\nPresidency remember that, in sustaining him, they must necessarily vote\r\nfor Mr. Pendleton for the Vice Presidency. McClellan and Pendleton are\r\nthe Siamese twins of Chicago, inseparable, and all who vote for the one,\r\nvote at the same time for the other. No voter can cast his suffrage in\r\nthis contest, except by voting for an electoral ticket, and the same\r\nelectors for General McClellan who may be chosen in any State, are to\r\nvote for Mr. Pendleton for the Vice Presidency. In other words, if\r\nGeneral McClellan is chosen President, Mr. Pendleton is elected at the\r\nsame time to the Vice Presidency of the United States. Now, recollect,\r\nthat the Vice President not only presides over the Senate of the United\r\nStates, and gives the casting vote in that body, but that, in case of\r\nthe death of the President, the Vice President becomes President of the\r\nUnited States. Now, two Presidents of the United States, within the last\r\ntwenty-three years, have died during their term of office (Harrison and\r\nTaylor), and one of them within a month after his inauguration. In both\r\nthese cases, the Vice Presidents chosen on the same electoral ticket\r\nwith the President, reversed the policy of the President elect. Tyler\r\nreversed the policy of Harrison, and Fillmore reversed the policy of\r\nTaylor. Why may not the same thing again occur, if Mr. Pendleton, by the\r\ndeath of General McClellan, should succeed him as President? This\r\nrenders an inquiry into the course and views of Mr. Pendleton a question\r\nof vital importance.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Pendleton, as his votes and speeches show, is against the war\r\nfor the Union, and has declared the coercion of a seceding rebel State\r\nnot only '_impracticable_,' but 'unconstitutional.' His words are, in\r\nbig speech in Congress of the 18th January, 1861, after most of the\r\nCotton States had seceded: 'Sir (he then said) the whole scheme of\r\ncoercion is impracticable. It is contrary to the genius and spirit of\r\nthe Constitution.' In accordance with these anti-coercion and anti-war\r\nviews, he continued to vote against the prosecution of the war, and\r\nagainst all the great measures passed for that purpose. He further then\r\nsaid, 'If your differences are so great that you cannot or will not\r\nreconcile them, then, gentlemen, let the seceding States depart in\r\npeace; let them establish their government and empire, and work out\r\ntheir destiny according to the wisdom which God has given them.' This is\r\nexactly the doctrine of Jefferson Davis, and of all the rebel leaders:\r\n'LET US ALONE.' _Let us alone_, while we overthrow the Government and\r\ndissolve the Union; _let us alone_, while we seize the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, and tear down or shoot down the flag of the Union from\r\nevery fort of the South. This is their language, and the Chicago\r\nConvention might just as well have nominated Jefferson Davis as George\r\nH. Pendleton as their candidate for the Vice Presidency of the United\r\nStates. Such a nomination of an avowed disunionist shows the true spirit\r\nof the Chicago Convention, and that all their general expressions of\r\ndevotion to the Union were mere empty sounds, calculated to secure\r\nvotes, but utterly false and hypocritical; for, while indulging in these\r\npharasaical expressions of love for the Union, they nominate, at the\r\nsame time, as their candidate for the Vice President, an avowed\r\nsecessionist and disunionist. We have nothing to do with the abstract\r\nopinions or wishes of Mr. Pendleton as regards the Union. Jefferson\r\nDavis repeatedly, and up to the very period of secession, expressed\r\nquite as much devotion to the old flag and to the Union as Mr.\r\nPendleton. But Mr. Davis soon became the head of the rebellion which Mr.\r\nPendleton declares we ought not, and have no constitutional power, to\r\nsuppress by force. Far all practical purposes, then, Mr. Pendleton is\r\njust as much a secessionist and disunionist as Jefferson Davis. Nor can\r\nit be alleged that Mr. Pendleton has changed these views. On the\r\ncontrary, as late as this year he voted in Congress against the test\r\nresolution of Green Clay Smith, of Kentucky, declaring 'that it is the\r\npolitical, civil, moral, and sacred duty of the people to meet the\r\nrebellion, fight it, crush it, and forever destroy it.' Now then, the\r\nChicago Convention, with a full knowledge of these votes and speeches,\r\nnominated Mr. Pendleton for the Vice Presidency, and contingently for\r\nthe Presidency of the United States. They knew full well that Mr.\r\nPendleton had declared the effort to crush the rebellion impracticable\r\nand unconstitutional, and that, therefore, if the power they proposed to\r\ngive him were ratified by his election, he could, and under his oath of\r\noffice to support the Constitution, he must, disband our armies,\r\nterminate the war, and permit the dissolution of the Union to be\r\nconsummated; or he might repeat his own words of 1861: Let the seceding\r\nStates depart in peace; let them establish their government and empire,\r\nand work out their destiny according to the wisdom which God has given\r\nthem.' It is, then, a sufficient objection to the Chicago candidates\r\nthat Mr. Pendleton, one of the candidates, inseparably connected with\r\nGeneral McClellan on the same electoral ticket, is, as we have seen,\r\nopposed to the war, and for all practical purposes as much a\r\nsecessionist and disunionist as Jefferson Davis. This being clear, if\r\nGeneral McClellan is really for the war to save the Union, by crushing\r\nthe rebellion, he must refuse to run on the same electoral ticket with\r\nMr. Pendleton; and if he does not, the people and history will assign to\r\nhim the same position. He cannot lend his name to aid the election of\r\nMr. Pendleton on the same ticket with himself, and profess devotion to\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another point on which I would say a word. It is this: From\r\nthe proceedings of the Canada Confederates, and their Northern allies,\r\nand the outgivings of the Richmond press, I conclude that their last\r\nsuggestion is this: two or more confederacies, Northern, Southern,\r\nMiddle, New England, Northwest, Mississippi, and Pacific. They are to be\r\nunited by free trade between them all, and by an alliance offensive and\r\ndefensive. That is, whenever any one of these confederacies go to war,\r\nwe are to join them in the conflict. Namely, if the Southern Confederacy\r\nwishes to conquer and annex Cuba or Porto Rico, or to conquer and extend\r\nslavery to Central America, and war follows, we are to join them in the\r\nwar, and sustain them with our blood and treasure. If so, the temple of\r\nJanus will never be closed on our continent, and war will be our normal\r\ncondition--a war not declared by us, or in our own interest, but by the\r\nSouth, as a foreign government. Such an alliance is visionary, ruinous,\r\nand impracticable. It is simply a scheme to secure Southern\r\nindependence.\r\n\r\nThen, as to the free trade to be secured by treaty between the several\r\nconfederacies. Recollect that each of these nations is to be foreign and\r\nindependent, and to have its separate treaties with foreign Powers. How\r\nlong would such treaties and such an alliance last? Why, the flag of the\r\nSouth would scarcely float over the mouth of the Chesapeake and\r\nMississippi, before the conflict with us of views and measures would\r\nbegin, nursed and promoted by foreign Powers, where each of the new\r\nconfederacies would have its separate ministers, representing distinct\r\nand discordant interests. When have such alliances or treaties lasted\r\neven for half a century? Where are all the leagues of antiquity or of\r\nmodern Europe? Where are all such leagues and treaties even of the last\r\ncentury? Where is our own alliance with France of 1778? Where all such\r\nalliances and treaties even of the first half of the present century?\r\nThey are all extinguished. Experience proves--the voice of history\r\nproclaims--that treaties or alliances between independent Powers are\r\nalways of short duration, being soon swept before the gust of contending\r\npassions, or melted in the crucible of conflicting interests. Where is\r\nthe celebrated alliance and treaty of 1814 and 1815 of Vienna, between\r\nthe great European Powers, establishing FOREVER, by a congress, the\r\nbalance of European power? Is there a single clause now in force? Where\r\nis the clause securing France to the Bourbons, and guaranteeing her\r\nforever against the reign of any of the Bonaparte family? Where are the\r\nstates whose independence was forever guaranteed by those treaties?\r\nWhere are Parma and Modena and Tuscany? Where is Lombardy, where the\r\nRomagna, Naples, and the Two Sicilies? Where are the duchies of\r\nLauenburg, Schleswig, and Holstein, and where the treaty of 1852 in\r\nregard to them? All, all have passed away, just as would our proposed\r\ntreaties or alliances. The first war would sweep them out of existence.\r\nNo, my countrymen; as Washington, the father of his country, most truly\r\ntold us in his Farewell Address: 'To the efficacy and permanency of your\r\nUnion, a Government _for the whole_ is indispensable. _No alliance_,\r\nhowever strict between the parts, can be an adequate substitute; they\r\nmust inevitably experience the _infractions_ and _interruptions_ which\r\n_all alliances_, in _all time_, have experienced.'\r\n\r\nWashington thus foresaw and warned us against this most insidious\r\nproposition to divide our country into separate confederacies, no matter\r\nhow strict the alliances between them might be; and let us adopt his\r\ncounsels.\r\n\r\nIs it not strange, while Italy and Germany seek, in Italian and German\r\nunity, relief from the ruin and oppression of so many independent states\r\nand governments, and are each making advances to that great\r\nconsummation, that we are asked to adopt the reactionary policy, and\r\nseparate glorious Union into distinct confederacies, soon to be followed\r\nby grinding taxation, by immense standing armies, and perpetual wars?\r\n\r\nAnd now then, my countrymen, I bring this letter to a close, imploring\r\nyou to give no vote which will subject the Union to the slightest peril.\r\nCome, then, my friends, of all parties, come, Republicans, and Whigs,\r\nand Democrats, and Irish and German and native citizens, trampling under\r\nour feet all past issues, and all old party names and prejudices, and,\r\nstanding on the broad basis of principle, let us vote, not for men or\r\nparties, but for the salvation and perpetuity of the Union.\r\n\r\n  R.

Vol. I. Hartford: Published by O. D. Case &\r\n     Co. Chicago; Geo. & E. W. Sherwood. 1864.\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention here to enter into any critical analysis of the\r\nvolume before us, but rather to give the reader an idea of what he may\r\nfind within it, in the words of Mr. Greeley himself. It is inscribed to\r\nMr. Bright, under the following dedication: 'To John Bright, British\r\nCommoner and Christian Statesman, the Friend of my Country, because the\r\nFriend of Mankind, this Record of a Nation's Struggle up from Darkness\r\nand Bondage to Light and Liberty, is regardfully, gratefully inscribed\r\nby the Author.'\r\n\r\nMr. Greeley says in his preface: 'No one can realize more fully than I\r\ndo that the History through whose pages our great-grandchildren will\r\ncontemplate the momentous struggle whereof this country has recently\r\nbeen and still is the arena, will not and cannot _now_ be written; and\r\nthat its author must give to the patient, careful, critical study of\r\ninnumerable documents and letters, an amount of time and thought which I\r\ncould not have commanded, unless I had been able to devote years,\r\ninstead of months only, to the preparation of this volume. I know, at\r\nleast, what History is, and how it must be made; I know how very far\r\nthis work must fall short of the lofty ideal.' ... 'What I have aimed to\r\ndo, is so to arrange the material facts, and so to embody the more\r\nessential documents, or parts of documents, illustrating those facts,\r\nthat the attentive, intelligent reader may learn from this work, not\r\nonly what were the leading incidents of our civil war, but its causes,\r\nincidents, and the inevitable sequence whereby ideas proved the germ of\r\nevents.' ... 'My subject naturally divides itself into two parts: I.\r\n_How we got into the war for the Union_; and II. _How we got out of it_.\r\nI have respected this division in my cast of the present work, and\r\nsubmit this volume as a clear elucidation of the former of these\r\nproblems, hoping to be at least equally satisfactory in my treatment of\r\nthe latter.' ... 'I shall labor constantly to guard against Mr.\r\nPollard's chief error--that of supposing that all the heroism,\r\ndevotedness, humanity, chivalry, evinced in the contest, were displayed\r\non one side; all the cowardice, ferocity, cruelty, rapacity, and general\r\ndepravity, on the other. I believe it to be the truth, and as such I\r\nshall endeavor to show, that, while this war has been signalized by some\r\ndeeds disgraceful to human nature, the general behavior of the\r\ncombatants on either side has been calculated to do honor even to the\r\nmen who, though fearfully misguided, are still our countrymen, and to\r\nexalt the prestige of the American name.'\r\n\r\nThe sale of the work before us has been immense. Such has been the\r\ndemand for Vol. I. of 'The American Conflict,' that the publishers have\r\nfound it impossible to supply the demand, even with regard to agents and\r\nsubscribers.

By EDMUND KIRKE,\r\n     Author of 'Among the Pines,' 'My Southern Friends,' etc. New York:\r\n     Carleton, publisher, 413 Broadway. 1864.\r\n\r\nThe author of this work, having been familiar with the South in days\r\nmore tranquil, had 'a desire to study the undercurrents of popular\r\nsentiment, and to renew his acquaintance with former friends and Union\r\nprisoners,' and so visited the Southwest in May last: the present volume\r\nthus originated. We cannot very readily discern how much of this work is\r\nfact, how much fiction. We have the Union scout, the poor white, the\r\nnegro, and other elements belonging both to the romance and reality of\r\nSouthern life in these days of struggle. Are the exquisitely simple and\r\nheart-touching thoughts and expressions which fall from the lips of the\r\npoor white or scout, actually true, or are they the coinage of Mr.\r\nKirke's own vivid fancy? Notwithstanding the hideous jargon in which\r\nthey occur, if real they evince a high soul, even in the midst of\r\nignorance, and are the gems of the work. The book ends with a detailed\r\naccount of the author's introduction to Colonel Jaques, and their\r\nsubsequent visit to Richmond, an episode in our history quite as\r\ncurious as the Sanders and Greeley conference at Clifton House, and\r\none which has excited quite as wide an interest. Mr. Kirke says of\r\nthe poor whites: 'I have endeavored to sketch their characters\r\nfaithfully--extenuating nothing and setting nothing down in malice--that\r\nthe reader may believe what I _know_, that there is not in the whole\r\nNorth a more worthy, industrious, loving class of people than the great\r\nbody of poor Southern Whites. Take the heel of the man-buying and\r\nwoman-whipping aristocrat from off their necks, give them free schools,\r\nand a chance to rise, and they will make the South, with its prolific\r\nsoil, its immense water power, and its vast mineral wealth, such a\r\ncountry as the sun never yet looked upon, and this Union such a Union as\r\nwill be the light of nations and the glory of the earth!'\r\n\r\n\r\n     POEMS OF THE WAR. By GEORGE H. BOKER. Boston: Ticknor & Fields.\r\n     1864. New York: for sale by D. Appleton & Co.\r\n\r\nMr. Boker has attained, what his more elaborate efforts sometimes lack,\r\nfire, concentration, and energy, in these 'Poems of the War.' We thank\r\nhim heartily that he has taken the glories of our country and the\r\nsufferings and deeds of our dauntless soldiers as his theme. Patriotism\r\nhas inspired him, and the ever well-tuned chords of his lyre ring out\r\nwith bolder and more soul-stirring melody than of old. 'On Board the\r\nCumberland,' 'The Sword Bearer,' 'The Ballad of New Orleans,' 'Crossing\r\nat Fredericksburg,' 'The Black Regiment,' 'In the Wilderness,' are truly\r\nnational poems, and should be read at every hearthstone in our land. We\r\nquote the closing lines from 'Upon the Hill before Centreville':\r\n\r\n  'Oh, let me not outlive the blow\r\n  That seals my country's overthrow!\r\n  And, lest this woful end come true,\r\n  Men of the North, I turn to you.\r\n  Display your vaunted flag once more,\r\n  Southward your eager columns pour!\r\n  Sound trump and fife and rallying drum;\r\n  From every hill and valley come!\r\n  Old men, yield up your treasured gold;\r\n  Can liberty be priced and sold?\r\n  Fair matrons, maids, and tender brides,\r\n  Gird weapons to your lovers' sides;\r\n  And, though your hearts break at the deed,\r\n  Give them your blessing and God-speed;\r\n  Then point them to the field of fame,\r\n  With words like those of Sparta's dame!\r\n  And when the ranks are full and strong,\r\n  And the whole army moves along,\r\n  A vast result of care and skill,\r\n  Obedient to the master will,\r\n  And our young hero draws the sword,\r\n  And gives the last commanding word\r\n  That hurls your strength upon the foe--\r\n  _Oh, let them need no second blow!_\r\n  Strike, as your fathers struck of old,\r\n  Through summer's heat and winter's cold;\r\n  Through pain, disaster, and defeat;\r\n  Through marches tracked with bloody feet;\r\n  Through every ill that could befall\r\n  The holy cause that bound them all!\r\n  Strike as they struck for liberty!\r\n  Strike as they struck to make you free!\r\n  Strike for the crown of victory!'\r\n\r\nWhile we honor our brave soldiers and their glorious deeds, let us also\r\nhonor their bards,\r\n\r\n            'Nor suffer them to steal,\r\n  Unthanked, away, to weep beside the harp,\r\n  Dejected, prayerful, while the fields are won.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     BROKEN LIGHTS: An Inquiry into the Present Condition and Future\r\n     Prospects of Religious Faith.

Contents of Part I. are: The Present Condition\r\nof Religious Faith. Chapter I. The Great Problem. II. The Solutions of\r\nthe Problem, Historical and Rational, Palæologian and Neologian. Under\r\nthe head of Palæologian we have The High Church Solution, the Low Church\r\nSolution; under Neologian we have the First Broad Church Solution, the\r\nSecond Broad Church Solution. We have then the Solutions of the Parties\r\nOutside the Church, Bishop Colenso on the Pentateuch, and Renan's 'Vie\r\nde Jesus.' Part II. gives us 'The Future Prospects of Religious Faith.'\r\nUnder the head of Rational, we have the Rationalist Solution of the\r\nProblems, The Faith of the Future, Theoretic Theism, and Practical\r\nTheism.\r\n\r\nOur author is of the school of Theodore Parker, a Theist. 'Three great\r\nprinciples--the absolute goodness of God; the final salvation of every\r\ncreated soul; and the divine authority of conscience--are the obvious\r\nfundamental canons of the Faith of the Future.' We continue our\r\nquotations: 'God will not leave us when all our puny theologies have\r\nfailed us, and all our little systems shall have had their day and\r\nceased to be. We shall yet praise Him who is the light of life, even\r\nthough the darkness may seem to gather round us now. Christianity may\r\nfail us, and we may watch it with straining eyes going slowly down from\r\nthe zenith where once it shone; but we need neither regret that it\r\nshould pass away, nor dread lest we be left in gloom. _Let it pass\r\naway_--that grand and wonderful faith! Let it go down, calmly and\r\nslowly, like an orb which has brightened half our heaven through the\r\nnight of the ages, and sets at last in glory, leaving its train of light\r\nlong gleaming in the sky, and mingling with the dawn. Already up the\r\nEast there climbs another Sun.' Again: 'The faith, then, for which we\r\nmust contend--the faith which we believe shall be the religion of future\r\nages--must be one founded on the Original Revelation of Consciousness,\r\nnot on the Traditional Revelation of Church or Book--a faith, not\r\nresting for its sole support on the peculiar History of one nation, but\r\nrated by the whole history of humanity.' ... 'The view which seems to be\r\nthe sole fitting one for our estimate of the character of Christ, is\r\nthat which regards him as the great REGENERATOR of Humanity. _His coming\r\nwas to the life of humanity what Regeneration is to the life of the\r\nindividual._ He has transformed the Law into the Gospel. He has changed\r\nthe bondage of the alien for the liberty of the sons of God. He has\r\nglorified Virtue into Holiness, Religion into Piety, and Duty into\r\nLove.'\r\n\r\nWhat a perpetual stumbling block in the way of all unbelief is the\r\nmarvellous character of Christ! We may strive to throw away the record,\r\nbut He remains a living force within the soul forever. The Theist would\r\nmiss Him even in his certain heaven!\r\n\r\nWe think we have given, in the few short extracts above, enough to\r\nenable our readers to perceive the standpoint from which this work is\r\nwritten. It is a clear statement of the dogmas held, the reasons for\r\ntheir adoption, and the hopes of what is styled the Church of the\r\nFuture. Of the ability of many of its adherents there can be no doubt.\r\nThe contest is upon the children of Faith. Let them meet it with candor,\r\nfairness, prayer, love, profound biblical and scientific erudition, and\r\nmay God comfort us with His eternal truth!\r\n\r\n\r\n     DRAMATIS PERSONÆ. By ROBERT BROWNING. Boston: Ticknor & Field. New\r\n     York: for sale by D. Appleton & Co.\r\n\r\nThis book has been already reviewed by the English critics, who are\r\nalways appreciative of Browning's merits, and tender to his faults. It\r\nis as wilful as its predecessors, as unintelligible, as fragmentary, its\r\nrhythm as distorted and broken, its diction as peculiar, its sequences\r\nas disconnected. Yet we think it shows gleams of higher poetic talent\r\nthan anything he has yet published. It contains eighteen poems. 'A Death\r\nin the Desert' is an imaginary portrayal of the death of St. John in his\r\nold age in a cave, to which he had been taken by some faithful adherents\r\nto save him from persecution. It is a sketch of power and originality.\r\nSt. John is supposed to speak:\r\n\r\n  'If I live yet, it is for good, more love\r\n  Through me to men: be nought but ashes here\r\n  That keeps awhile my semblance, who was John--\r\n  Still when they scatter, there is left on earth\r\n  No one alive who _knew_ (consider this!)\r\n  --Saw with his eyes and handled with his hands\r\n  That which was from the first the Word of Life.\r\n  How will it be when none more saith 'I saw?''\r\n\r\nVery original and very disagreeable in its highly wrought and subtile\r\nRealism is 'Caliban upon Setebos, or Natural Theology in the Island,' a\r\nstudy from Shakspeare's 'Tempest.' It is a curious exposition of the\r\nphilosophy of such a being. At the close, when Caliban, who speaks in\r\nthe third person, is beginning to think of Setebos, 'his dam's god,' as\r\nnot so formidable after all, a great storm awakes, which upsets all his\r\nreasoning, and makes him fall flat on his face with fright:\r\n\r\n  'What, what? A curtain o'er the world at once!\r\n  Crickets stop hissing; not a bird--or, yes,\r\n  There scuds His raven that hath told Him all!\r\n  It was fool's play, this prattling! Ha! The wind\r\n  Shoulders the pillared dust, death's house o' the move,\r\n  And fast invading fires begin! White blaze--\r\n  A tree's head snaps--and there, there, there, there, there,\r\n  His thunder follows! Fool to gibe at Him!\r\n  Lo! 'Lieth flat and loveth Setebos!\r\n  'Maketh his teeth meet through his upper lip,\r\n  Will let those quails fly, will not eat this mouth\r\n  One little mess of whelks, so he may 'scape!'\r\n\r\n'Mr. Sludge, the Medium,' one of the longer poems, is intended,\r\naccording to rumor, to demolish Mr. Home, and includes some sharp\r\nthrusts at various persons who still patronize him after having found\r\nhim guilty of fraud.\r\n\r\nThe story runs that a lady and gentleman of eminence, devout\r\nspiritualists, residing at Rome, confessed to Mr. Browning that during\r\nMr. Home's stay at their house they once forbade his putting his hand\r\nunder the table, and the spirits wouldn't rap, and Home burst into\r\ntears, and confessed that _on that occasion only_ he had deceived them;\r\nthat on one other occasion he had put phosphorus on the tips of wires\r\nand stretched them from the roof of their house to represent certain\r\nspiritual apparitions. 'And what did you say, how did you act, upon the\r\ndiscovery?' asked Mr. Browning. 'Oh,' replied the lady, 'I rebuked him\r\nseverely; told him plainly how shameful it was that one who had been so\r\nsupernaturally gifted should act so, and told him that he ought to\r\nrepent.' 'And he still remained with you, and--' 'Oh, yes, we are\r\nperfectly sure that everything was genuine afterward.' Upon which the\r\npoet was so disgusted that he vented his indignation in 'Mr. Sludge.'\r\n\r\n\r\n     FIRESIDE TRAVELS. By JAMES RUSSELL LOWELL. 'Travelling makes a man\r\n     sit still in his old age with satisfaction, and travel over the\r\n     world again in his chair and bed by discourse and thoughts.'--_The\r\n     Voyage of Italy, by Richard Lassels, Gent_. Boston; Ticknor &\r\n     Fields. 1864. New York: for sale by D. Appleton & Co.\r\n\r\nMr. Lowell says, in big short preface: 'The greater part of this volume\r\nwas printed ten years ago in _Putnam's Monthly_ and _Graham's Magazine_.\r\nThe additions (most of them about Italy) have been made up, as the\r\noriginal matter was, from old letters and journals written on the spot.\r\nMy wish was to describe not so much what I went to see, as what I saw\r\nthat was most unlike what one sees at home. If the reader find\r\nentertainment, he will find all I hoped to give him.'\r\n\r\nAnd a churl he surely were if he find it not; for a right pleasant book\r\nit is to read--genial and full of the real Lowell humor, almost as\r\ncharacteristic as Jean Paul's, _der einzige_. 'Cambridge Thirty Years\r\nAgo' will carry many of our most distinguished men back to the sunny\r\ndays of youth, while the boys of to-day will be delighted to know how it\r\nfared with them then and there. Contents: Cambridge Thirty Years Ago; A\r\nMoosehead Journal; Leaves from My Journal in Italy and Elsewhere; At\r\nSea; In the Mediterranean; Italy; A Few Bits of Roman Mosaic.\r\n\r\nThere is no use in praising a book of Lowell's; everybody knows, reads,\r\nand loves him.\r\n\r\n     SIMONSON'S CIRCULAR ZOOLOGICAL CHART. A Directory to the Study of\r\n     the Animal Kingdom. Published by Schermerhorn, Bancroft & Co., 130\r\n     Grand street, New York, and 25 North Fourth street, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThis chart must prove a valuable guide to the teacher, and a great aid\r\nto the student of Natural History. It appears to have been carefully\r\ncompiled from modern standard works, and is divided and subdivided as\r\naccurately as the limited space allows. It is a vast aid to the memory,\r\nshowing at a glance the classification of the animal kingdom; and,\r\nbringing together the various groups of animals on one page, it stamps\r\nits complicated lesson on the mind through the rapid power of the eye.\r\nWhen the enormous number of species is considered, the advantage of such\r\na chart may be readily imagined. It may be used as an introduction by\r\nthe teacher, or side by side with any text book. We heartily recommend\r\nit to notice.\r\n\r\n\r\n     PERCE'S MAGNETIC GLOBES. A very ingenious invention is here offered\r\n     to the public through Mr. J. F. Trow, of 50 Greene street, New York.\r\n     It consists of a hollow Globe made of soft iron, and Magnetic\r\n     Objects, representing the races of mankind, animals, trees,\r\n     light-houses, are supplied with it, which, _adhering to the\r\n     surface_, illustrate clearly the attraction of gravitation, the\r\n     rotundity of the earth, its diurnal motion, the changes of day and\r\n     night, and many other things very difficult to make intelligible to\r\n     children.

Philadelphia:\r\n     Frederick Leypoldt. 1864.\r\n\r\nA singular romance, interwoven of the art life of the Old, and the\r\nforest life of the New World. The main character is the _Great Stone\r\nFace_, already immortalized by the lamented Hawthorne. It is here\r\npresented to us under a new aspect, and while we think that even those\r\ngrand old rocks fail to embody the glorious ideal of a Christus Judex,\r\nwe must acknowledge the pleasure we have derived from the fanciful\r\ndescriptions and pleasant associations offered us in this dainty little\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas is again upon us, dear readers; we may almost hear the\r\ngathering chime of its happy bells upon the frosty air. It is a time\r\nwhen even strangers may hold commune; let us take advantage of it, and\r\nlearn to know something of each other. But are we indeed strangers? It\r\nis true that we stand as abstract impersonalities, as disembodied\r\nspirits, unknown even by name to one another. Yet have we held relations\r\nwhich we cannot shake off even if we would. 'The most obscure of\r\nliterary men' we may be, yet has your kind smile often cheered us as we\r\nlabored to place before you the wants, wishes, tastes, views, hopes, and\r\naims of our common country. Caterer as we are for you, through us and\r\nthe handywork of our skilful printer have our able writers spun their\r\ngolden threads through heart, mind, and soul. Contributors, readers, and\r\neditor are alike linked in these glittering spiritual meshes, and can\r\nnever be quite the same as if the web had never held them for its\r\npassing moment in its light zone of thought. For ideas generate duties,\r\nknowledge stimulates action, and to act in a world of doubt may well be\r\nonerous. We frankly confess to you that a dread responsibility has cast\r\na deep shadow upon all our moments since the commencement of our\r\nintercourse with you. Our butterfly hours were then past: we grew into\r\nwork-a-day bees--if only we have stored some honey in your hives to pay\r\nus for the lost idlesse of our dreamy summers! If it 'is greatly wise to\r\ntalk with our past hours, and ask them what report they bear to Heaven'\r\nwhen spent only for ourselves, it is a solemn thing to call them back,\r\nand ask them what report they bear to Heaven for the thousands to whom\r\nthey have ministered. We spread the table lovingly before you: what if\r\nthere should be something in yourselves to turn our healthful food to\r\npoison? On marches THE CONTINENTAL with its light and heavy freight of\r\nwinged words and thoughts, striding from _monthly_ stepping-stone to\r\nstepping-stone on the long route of Time. Stepping-stones in Time are\r\nthey now truly, but as we gaze they seem to grow into Eternity, and the\r\nbuds which twine their glow around them ripen slowly into ever-living\r\nfruit in the strange clime of the Everlasting Now to which we are all\r\nhastening.\r\n\r\n  How clear that Christmas chime upon the frosty air!\r\n\r\nReader, is it too much to hope that in spite of all our short-comings,\r\nwe have yet been loyal to your better hours, and faithful in the field\r\ngiven us to sow for the heavenly Reapers? We have labored to interest,\r\namuse, and instruct you for the last eighteen months: have you learned\r\nin that time to _trust_ us as we have learned to care for you? Do you\r\nknow us loyal patriots and true Christians, even if of a broad and\r\nall-unsectarian faith? If we are too frank, it is because we are certain\r\nthat truth can never contradict itself, that nature must be one with\r\nrevelation, that he errs who fears the crucible of the savant or would\r\nhold science in leading strings. THE CONTINENTAL seeks the light,\r\ncondemns to silence no new Galileo, tortures no creative Kepler, has no\r\nfires for heretics, and nothing worse than an incredulous smile for the\r\nshivering witches and mediums, the muscular demons of modern\r\nspiritualism. It rejects no scientific investigation honorably pursued,\r\nfor all paths lead back to the Maker of the Universe, and the honest\r\nseeker must find Him at the end of his route. That God is our Father,\r\nthat we are made in His triune image, that Christ is our elder Brother,\r\nthe great Regenerator of our race, is surely the ever open, ever mystic\r\nsecret of the universe!\r\n\r\nWe have travelled on together through a gloomy year. The air has been\r\nsad with sighs, dim with tears, restless with great sobs of human\r\nanguish. But we are drifting into calmer swells on the great Time-Ocean,\r\nand the _crimson_ year of '64 is almost past. The dwellers of the Valley\r\nalready look for the morning star, while those upon the Hilltop hail the\r\nauroral light of '65. Enshrined in and sparkling through its golden\r\nglow two mystic figures gleam; the star of the morning pales before\r\ntheir splendor. The one is godlike in her majesty, sublime through\r\nconquered suffering, the awful smile of the Crucified seems shining\r\nthrough the features transfigured since He wore them, and the cross\r\nglitters in all the glory of Self-sacrifice on her broad breast. She\r\nwears a girdle blue as if woven from the depths of heaven, and as we\r\ngaze we see great opals with veiled hearts of fire form into quaint old\r\nrunic letters upon it, and the God-word LOVE flashes down the secret of\r\nher inner life upon us. She is still young as when she woke in Paradise,\r\nand, seeing the End, is not yet weary with her long journey of Exile.\r\nBrighter gates than those of Eden stand unbarred before her! In her\r\nright hand she holds unrolled, that all may read, the great Magna Charta\r\nof universal Human Rights, and even at this distance we may see\r\nEMANCIPATION upon its broad margin. We know the once sad spirit now, no\r\nlonger _sad_, the _radiant_ Genius of Humanity.\r\n\r\nHer vigorous arm is round a younger and less solemn form, a form of\r\nwildering beauty, whose gold hair glitters like a nimbus in the level\r\nrays of morning; with an irresistible impulse we take her into the\r\ninnermost folds of our hearts, we feel her to be _our own_; our banner\r\nin her right hand sways and tosses on the fresh breeze, its stars, round\r\nwhich new suns are ever clustering, throw their dazzling light upon her,\r\nand the young eagles turning from the sun throng around her to drink the\r\nsplendor from her brighter brow. The long streamers from her girdle\r\nfloat athwart the sky, their wavy lines, red, white, and blue, quiver\r\nwith delight as the wild zephyrs caress them, thrilling the air with\r\nshifting play of passionate color. Ha! what miracle is this?--whatsoever\r\nlight may fall upon them, under what angle soever we may see them, as\r\nwere it magically woven into their warp and woof, we read the word now\r\ngraven on our hearts--UNION! Her left hand holds closely clasped to her\r\nheart a great urn, glowing as it were an immense ruby--ah! we need no\r\nwords to tell us what the young spirit clasps so fondly to her\r\nbreast--we _feel_ it is the dust of the holy dead, who gave their lives\r\non the red battle field that she might live: their very ashes glow with\r\nliving fire! Her white feet rest on the sacred graves of Shiloh,\r\nAntietam, Murfreesboro', Gettysburg, Vicksburg, Lookout Mountain, the\r\nWilderness, Atlanta, Winchester, and Cedar Creek, from which she has\r\nnewly risen in her young strength and ever-growing glory.\r\n\r\nShe is the brilliant Spirit of our Nation! the new hope of all People!\r\nHer career is ever onward with the Genius of Humanity into the enchanted\r\nrealm of the happy Future. No chains are in her white hands now. The\r\ntired laborer rests as she smiles upon him; the bay of the bloodhound\r\nand sharp crack of the lash cease in the white cotton field; the Indian\r\nburies his tomahawk, no longer wounding the still ear of the forest with\r\nhis shrill war whoop; the maiden walks fearlessly free, for all men are\r\nnow her brothers; shielding her sanctity; the wife is happy, for the\r\nhusband has won her esteem, and it is no shame to crown him with her\r\nlove; and cherub-children sport around, lovely and happy as the\r\nheaven-seraphs.\r\n\r\nPeace to our glorious dead! Eternal honor to the martyrs of freedom!\r\nFrom the sharp agonies of their true hearts springs now first to\r\n_conscious_ birth the vigorous Spirit of our Nation. We never knew\r\naright how very dear to us she was until the traitors tried to tear her\r\nlimb from limb because her heart was open to all made in the image of\r\ntheir God--because she knew the sacred worth of man.\r\n\r\n  How near those Christmas chimes peal on the frosty air!\r\n\r\nAnd if we will but think of it, a Nationality is always of slow growth,\r\nof gradual development. It, like man himself, is born in pain and\r\nanguish. It is indeed a living member of the Grand Man of which Humanity\r\nis composed. Since the forty years wandering of the children of Israel\r\nin the desert, how much suffering has been endured to hold it sacred!\r\nThe history of the present time is but a record of fierce struggles to\r\nachieve or hold a Nationality. Poland has hung on the cross of her great\r\nenemy for centuries rather than yield its sanctity. He has torn and\r\nscattered its quivering members, blotted it out in blood from the names\r\nknown on earth, it has been murdered, and fed upon by three great\r\nChristian Powers ('Oh, the pity of it!')--Catholic Austria, Protestant\r\nPrussia and Greek-Churched Russia--but it is not dead: it lives in all\r\nthe energy of self-abnegating suffering on the mountains of Causasus,\r\nthe steppes of Asia, the frozen plains of Siberia, in the depths of\r\nRussian mines, the darkness of Russian prisons, and it still will live\r\nuntil the last Pole is laid in the last grave of his heroic but\r\nunfortunate race. Such is its vitality when once truly born. Denmark\r\nturns pale and shivers as she feels it may be torn from her; 'Italia,\r\nwith the fatal gift of beauty for her dower,' the fair land where fairer\r\nJuliets breathe the enamored air, art--crowned and genius-gifted,\r\nwrithes in agony until it may be her own; Greece long bled for it; and\r\nthe brave and haughty Magyar, to whom a courser fleet and the free air\r\nare necessities of daily life, braves and bears prisons, chains, and\r\npoverty, in the hope of its attainment. What is this precious\r\nNationality? Like all basic elements, it is difficult to define. It is\r\nnot a State, a Constitution, nor is it made by man at all. An able\r\nwriter in _The North American Review_ for October says: 'It may be\r\nsaid, in general, to be the sum of the differences, geographical,\r\nhistorical, political, and moral, which separate a people as a community\r\nfrom every other--of those differences which modify the character of\r\neach individual, and the results of which are combined in the traits of\r\nnational character. The consciousness of its existence is developed\r\nslowly, and it is long before the sentiment of Nationality--the true\r\nfoundation of patriotism--gains force over the hearts and convictions of\r\na people. But this sentiment, when it has once taken root, is one of the\r\n_most powerful_ of those by which human conduct is affected. It is a\r\nsentiment of the highest order, lifting men out of narrow and selfish\r\nindividualism into a region where they behold their duties as members\r\none of another, as partakers of the general life of humanity--the\r\ninheritors of the past, the trustees of the future.'\r\n\r\n'What is planetary humanity?' says Krasinski. 'It is the entirety and\r\nunity of all the powers and capacities of the human spirit expressed\r\nvisibly on the earth through harmony and concord, the love of its\r\nmembers, that is of the various nationalities. As all the members of the\r\nhuman body are the visible and various parts of the invisible human I,\r\nwhich connects and rules them all, so the visible nationalities must in\r\ntheir variety and harmonious unity become in some future time the living\r\nmembers of a universal humanity. The world knows to-day to what point\r\nits history is tending: it knows it is governed by the wisdom of God,\r\nand that its end is the Humanity, the entire universality brought into\r\nperfect accord with the will of God, knowing and executing the laws\r\ngiven it by God. But the means to this end, the instruments, the living\r\nmembers, are the _Nationalities_, in which all the varieties of the\r\nhuman race have their fairest bloom, their most precious flower. What\r\nthe tones are in the musical chord they are in humanity, eternal variety\r\nin eternal harmony and concord. It is impossible to conceive Humanity\r\nwithout them; it would then be unity without variety, consequently no\r\n_proper unity_ at all, a mere lifeness _oneness_. States are of human\r\ncreation, an aggregative collection of small parts; but nationalities\r\nare made by God alone, and therefore not states without nationalities,\r\nbut states forming nationalities, belong to the coming union of\r\nuniversal humanity, and pass into the Christian order. States have risen\r\nbefore this to destroy a nationality, dividing and quartering it for the\r\nprofit of some selfish ideal, tearing asunder a living, palpitating\r\norganism, murdering a visible member of the Universal Humanity. He is\r\nbut a child who calls this merely a political crime: it is a crime of\r\nthe very deepest dye, a crime against the Humanity itself, against\r\nreligion, where the daring criminals, striding over all lower spheres,\r\nbreak into the circles of the living God. To tear asunder a state of\r\nmerely human creation, generated only by human interests and passions,\r\nwould be a political crime, but to wish to dismember and murder a\r\nGod-given nationality, when the realization of the idea of humanity on\r\nthe planet cannot be filled without it, is a rebellion against the\r\neternal truth of God--it is a sacrilege! The recognition of such\r\nviolation were participation; opposition to such impiety is religion!'\r\n\r\nOur very origin teaches us union. We have sprung from so many races that\r\nit is throbbing in our very life-pulse, and is written on the red\r\ntablets of our hearts. It runs and dances in our blood, tingles along\r\nour nerves, colors our thoughts, tones our emotions, and determines our\r\naffections. All the old and bitter European animosities die in us, for\r\nits Peoples are fused in our _one_ life pulse. A little child of our own\r\nhousehold now unites in the sacred oneness of American life, English,\r\nScotch, Irish, Welsh, Dutch, German, French, Saxon, Bohemian, and Polish\r\nnationalities. What lessons we have in our multiform descent, if we will\r\nbut heed them; what inner teachings of sympathy and love, if we will but\r\nlearn them! Distinctive nationalities, giving such beautiful variety to\r\nthe _earth_, here join in the individual, imparting the greatest\r\ncomplexity and variety to internal _character_. Such nationalities,\r\nstill existing unimpaired abroad, are here formed into _one_ of\r\nunequalled breadth and grandeur; their scattered rays of light are here\r\nconcentrated into _one_ great focus; the blood of the various Peoples\r\npours through _one_ great heart, and the common gifts, hopes, creeds of\r\nthe separated and warring nations meet in the holy mystery of _one_\r\ngrand national life. Here, indeed, is the widest variety in the closest\r\nunity, the life of the warring Past melting into that of the\r\nmyriad-pulsed Present, the certain hope of a harmonious Future.\r\n\r\nThe maturity and highest powers of other nations being necessary as its\r\ngerms, what wonder that our nationality should be the latest born on\r\nearth, or that in view of the broad love stirring in its soul, because\r\nof its manifold descent, its first articulate accents should be ALL MEN\r\nARE BORN FREE AND EQUAL! This is a union in the laboratory of\r\nassimilative nature, such as has never before been dreamed of, vital and\r\nall embracing, weaving into one palpitating mesh the very fibres of\r\nbeing itself. The union of long-jarring nations is consummated,\r\nperfected in us, and shall not we, the children of all climes, be _one_\r\nin our own marvellous nationality? 'Divide and conquer' is old strategy,\r\nbut despots and tyrants strike in vain at this wondrous mingling of all\r\nPeoples in one great PEOPLE, where the People are the Sovereigns; for\r\nthis UNION is spun in the loom of Eternal Destiny, throbs in each\r\nlinking life-pulse, is knit into our very nature, and kindles in the\r\nclose unity and sanctity of our national life under the creative breath\r\nof God himself. Palsied be the hand armed to strike the multitudinously\r\nmingled life of Humanity as it circles through our glorious Union!\r\n\r\n'Peace on earth, good will to men,' chime out the Christmas bells from\r\nold Trinity!\r\n\r\nIt is this struggle to preserve our nationality intact which has\r\nsanctified our war, from the red heart of which has grown a patriotism\r\nwhich, glowing like a central sun, burns away all the dross of our\r\nearlier materialism, gives as self-reliance, and frees us at last from\r\nour long tutelage to the Old World. And never had patriotism a more\r\nsolid ground than ours, since the power, growth, and safety of our\r\nnationality are the progress, happiness, and prosperity of humanity\r\nitself. Everything that breathes the breath of human life, however\r\nopposed to it now, is _really_ benefited by our growth. As a Government\r\nwe stand first upon the earth; the first utterance of our brave lips\r\nbeing--all men are born free and equal. Sublime, bold, and living words;\r\nblessed be the lips which uttered them! And we are beginning to fulfil\r\nthe inspired ideal. Alas! we have suffered too much from permitting an\r\nevil germ to grow up side by side with this great annunciation, to fall\r\nspeedily again into a like error. It has taken down into the dust our\r\nbest and dearest, saddened almost every hearthstone in the land, and,\r\nsaddest of all, wrought ruin on the Southern soul, maddening our\r\nbrethren there into modern Cains, armed against the sacred life of their\r\nand our nationality. For what cause did Cain kill his brother?\r\n'Because,' says St. John, 'his own works were evil, and his brother's\r\njust.' We will surely save it, but that done, we have an arduous task\r\nbefore us. Christianity and love must take the place of expediency,\r\nmachiavelism, and cunning diplomacy in the sphere of politics. We see\r\nthe smile of scorn upon the lips of the doubter; he deems the thing\r\nimpossible. So he would have pronounced our noble record of the last\r\nthree years, three years ago. Nay, it is already half accomplished,\r\nsince we now know it must be done. The black man free, the red man must\r\nat last receive attention. The protection of our laws must be thrown\r\naround him; justice must guide our future dealings with him, and sorrow\r\nfor all the fearful ills we have wrought upon him must awaken larger\r\nsympathy, and elicit tender mercy. The race are dying out among us: let\r\nus at least soothe their parting hours. And let the Government look well\r\nto its avaricious agents. Our people are generous, and mean to be just;\r\nthat is not enough: they must take the proper means, and see that their\r\nbeneficent intentions are carried out with regard to this wretched\r\nremnant. It is not possible that a race so full of wild natural\r\neloquence, of graceful imagery, of tender metaphor, of stern endurance,\r\ncan be _utterly_ lost and depraved. Be it our noble task to try to save\r\nthese wild children of the forest, while throwing the most complete\r\nprotection around our brave frontier population. Our nationality is now\r\nfully born--on our banner is inscribed the equal rights of humanity. Our\r\nmission is revealed to us--it is that labor shall be elevated, and that\r\nequal justice be the law of _actual life_. 'That the human race is in a\r\nreal sense one--that its efforts are common, and tend to a joint result,\r\nthat its several members may stand in the eye of their Maker, not only\r\nas _individual_ agents, but as contributors to this joint result--is a\r\ndoctrine which our reason, perhaps, finds something to support, and\r\nwhich our heart readily accepts.' This Christmas peal rings to us as it\r\nhas never rung before: let it awaken our consciousness of what God means\r\nus to be upon this planet, and touch our heart. It has at last reached\r\nthe ear of the emancipated African, after pealing nearly nineteen\r\nhundred years for the more favored part of humanity; and, thanks to the\r\nmercy of God and our own manhood, the most oppressed of the brethren of\r\nChrist may now feel themselves men. The dark wife, in her new right to\r\nbe faithful, is at last a woman; her dusky children are now her own, and\r\ncannot be torn from her arms at the dictates of one who has bought at\r\nthe human auction block the right to torture the body and soul. Is not\r\nhumanity newborn among us? Is the negro of the accursed race of Ham? It\r\nis we who curse, not God, whose very name is Love! Well may our\r\nChristmas bells ring on so merrily, for our age is great and glorious.\r\nIt is a pupil of the entire Past, the heir of all its knowledge, the\r\ninheritor of all its wisdom. The Future is its own. _The sphere of\r\npolitics must be redeemed from the demons of expediency and interest\r\nwhich have so long ruled there; it is to be vitalized and purified from\r\nall iniquity._ It is an Augean stable we have to clean, but Hercules was\r\none, and we are many. The People are at last sovereign. Every man who\r\nworks for humanity has God upon his side; he cannot fail, for the might\r\nof Omnipotence is with his puny arm. This is the task now set before us:\r\nit lies directly in our onward path--we cannot take a step really in\r\nadvance until it is achieved. If we fail now, all is lost. Our dead\r\nheroes will not rest in their graves until the task is done, and their\r\nyoung lives will have been a vain sacrifice. This crimson year is dying\r\nfast; bury with it all past wickedness! May our long civil war die out\r\nwith its knell, the corpse of Slavery be laid in its bloody grave, and\r\nthe vain attempts of assembled despots to destroy our glorious\r\nnationality perish forever! Bury with this blood-red year all malice and\r\nuncharitableness, all sectarian suspicion and distrust, all partisan\r\npolitical violence and hatred, and let the new year ring in one faith,\r\none hope, one country undivided and _indivisible_. Our Union means all\r\nthis, and a great many things more which it has not yet entered into the\r\nheart of man to conceive. We can effect wonders if we will, for the\r\n_individual_ effort makes the _universal_ all. Who would prove recreant\r\nin such a cause? Come! it is pleasant to work for humanity; fatigue\r\nitself seems sweet, the strength of the race nerves the individual arm,\r\nlabor grows into prayer, human sympathy and communion become godlike and\r\nopen heaven. We are none of us so little that we can do nothing; we are\r\nall necessary to the good of the whole. The highest individuality and\r\nfreedom should generate the widest social love and charity. No labor is\r\nreally irksome that helps the masses of our fellow men. If we have the\r\nPromethean fire, let it burn to light and warm them. The race is one,\r\nnor can we be happy while its members suffer. The moment we have done\r\none duty faithfully, another and a higher awaits us. To be condemned to\r\nwork only for ourselves were the true hell, the self-kindled fire of\r\neverlasting torture! We are the children of the nineteenth century, have\r\nbeen nourished upon the humane laws of this noble country, we are sons\r\nof God, brothers of Christ, heirs of glory, immortals. Let us assume the\r\nmajesty of our being, drape ourselves in our heaven-woven robes of love,\r\nopen our hearts to the poor and wretched, instruct the ignorant, reclaim\r\nthe vicious, bear each other's burdens, frown on vice, give up our petty\r\nvanities, cease our frivolous excuses that, we have no influence, when\r\nevery one of us has an immortal in charge, use our strength to forbid\r\noppression, whether of individuals or nationalities. Then might the day\r\nseen by the prophets, sung by poets, and believed in by devout hearts,\r\ndawn upon this planet before the blessed '65 were tolled to rest.\r\n\r\n\"A man shall be more precious than gold, ay, than the finest of gold.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fool shall no more be called prince, nor the deceitful great.\"\r\n\r\n\"And He shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar\r\noff; and they shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their\r\nspears into spades; nation shall not take sword against nation; neither\r\nshall they learn war any more.\r\n\r\n\"And every man shall sit under his own vine and fig tree, and there\r\nshall be none to make them afraid.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will give my laws into their mind, and I will write them in their\r\nheart; and I will be their God; and they shall be my people.\"\r\n\r\nPeace on earth, good will toward men, still peal the Christmas bells,\r\nuntil the frosty air seems quivering with the new joy of humanity.\r\n\r\nFair voyage through the realms of Space, the universe of stars, the\r\npassionate throbs of Time, with thy precious human freight, O lovely\r\nPlanet, cradling our dead in thy green bosom, and uniting the living in\r\none great nation; and may the brightest sunshine fall upon thy flowers\r\nuntil thy young Immortals are all landed in the Port of Heaven!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n'COR UNUM, VIA UNA.'\r\n\r\nGOD BLESS OUR NATIVE LAND!\r\n\r\n\r\n  From every clime, and name, and race,\r\n    The thronging myriads came,\r\n  A mighty Empire's bounds to trace,\r\n    A wilderness to tame!\r\n\r\n  _Chorus_--From mountain peak to sear-girt shore,\r\n    Let Freedom's noble band\r\n  Uplift the song thrills each heart's core:\r\n    God bless our native land!\r\n\r\n  Columbia's plains are broad and fair,\r\n    Each coast an ocean laves,\r\n  Vast lakes and streams fleet navies bear\r\n    Upon their sun-lit waves.\r\n\r\n  _Chorus._\r\n\r\n  Her mountains towering meet the skies,\r\n    Her vales are clad in green,\r\n  Her leafy forests proudly rise,\r\n    Pure gold her grain's bright sheen.\r\n\r\n  _Chorus._\r\n\r\n  United flows our mingled blood,\r\n    And Freedom guards the land,\r\n  While linked in closest brotherhood,\r\n    Invincible we stand!\r\n\r\n  _Chorus._\r\n\r\n  Unfurl our banner!
