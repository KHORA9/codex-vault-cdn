His\r\nfather was an attorney, who had fifteen children, of whom all but four\r\ndied in their youth.  Edmund, the second son, being of delicate health in\r\nhis childhood, was taught at home and at his grandfather's house in the\r\ncountry before he was sent with his two brothers Garrett and Richard to a\r\nschool at Ballitore, under Abraham Shackleton, a member of the Society of\r\nFriends.  For nearly forty years afterwards Burke paid an annual visit to\r\nBallitore.\r\n\r\nIn 1744, after leaving school, Burke entered Trinity College, Dublin.  He\r\ngraduated B.A. in 1748; M.A., 1751.  In 1750 he came to London, to the\r\nMiddle Temple.  In 1756 Burke became known as a writer, by two pieces.\r\nOne was a pamphlet called \"A Vindication of Natural Society.\"  This was\r\nan ironical piece, reducing to absurdity those theories of the excellence\r\nof uncivilised humanity which were gathering strength in France, and had\r\nbeen favoured in the philosophical works of Bolingbroke, then lately\r\npublished.  Burke's other work published in 1756, was his \"Essay on the\r\nSublime and Beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nAt this time Burke's health broke down.  He was cared for in the house of\r\na kindly physician, Dr. Nugent, and the result was that in the spring of\r\n1757 he married Dr. Nugent's daughter.  In the following year Burke made\r\nSamuel Johnson's acquaintance, and acquaintance ripened fast into close\r\nfriendship.  In 1758, also, a son was born; and, as a way of adding to\r\nhis income, Burke suggested the plan of \"The Annual Register.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1761 Burke became private secretary to William Gerard Hamilton, who\r\nwas then appointed Chief Secretary to Ireland.  In April, 1763, Burke's\r\nservices were recognised by a pension of 300 pounds a year; but he threw\r\nthis up in April, 1765, when he found that his services were considered\r\nto have been not only recognised, but also bought.  On the 10th of July\r\nin that year (1765) Lord Rockingham became Premier, and a week later\r\nBurke, through the good offices of an admiring friend who had come to\r\nknow him in the newly-founded Turk's Head Club, became Rockingham's\r\nprivate secretary.  He was now the mainstay, if not the inspirer, of\r\nRockingham's policy of pacific compromise in the vexed questions between\r\nEngland and the American colonies.  Burke's elder brother, who had lately\r\nsucceeded to his father's property, died also in 1765, and Burke sold the\r\nestate in Cork for 4,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nHaving become private secretary to Lord Rockingham, Burke entered\r\nParliament as member for Wendover, and promptly took his place among the\r\nleading speakers in the House.\r\n\r\nOn the 30th of July, 1766, the Rockingham Ministry went out, and Burke\r\nwrote a defence of its policy in \"A Short Account of a late Short\r\nAdministration.\"  In 1768 Burke bought for 23,000 pounds an estate called\r\nGregories or Butler's Court, about a mile from Beaconsfield.  He called\r\nit by the more territorial name of Beaconsfield, and made it his home.\r\nBurke's endeavours to stay the policy that was driving the American\r\ncolonies to revolution, caused the State of New York, in 1771, to\r\nnominate him as its agent.  About May, 1769, Edmund Burke began the\r\npamphlet here given, _Thoughts on the Present Discontents_.  It was\r\npublished in 1770, and four editions of it were issued before the end of\r\nthe year.  It was directed chiefly against Court influence, that had\r\nfirst been used successfully against the Rockingham Ministry.  Allegiance\r\nto Rockingham caused Burke to write the pamphlet, but he based his\r\nargument upon essentials of his own faith as a statesman.  It was the\r\nbeginning of the larger utterance of his political mind.\r\n\r\nCourt influence was strengthened in those days by the large number of\r\nnewly-rich men, who bought their way into the House of Commons for\r\npersonal reasons and could easily be attached to the King's party.  In a\r\npopulation of 8,000,000 there were then but 160,000 electors, mostly\r\nnominal.  The great land-owners generally held the counties.  When two\r\ngreat houses disputed the county of York, the election lasted fourteen\r\ndays, and the costs, chiefly in bribery, were said to have reached three\r\nhundred thousand pounds.  Many seats in Parliament were regarded as\r\nhereditary possessions, which could be let at rental, or to which the\r\nnominations could be sold.  Town corporations often let, to the highest\r\nbidders, seats in Parliament, for the benefit of the town funds.  The\r\nelection of John Wilkes for Middlesex, in 1768, was taken as a triumph of\r\nthe people.  The King and his ministers then brought the House of Commons\r\ninto conflict with the freeholders of Westminster.  Discontent became\r\nactive and general.  \"Junius\" began, in his letters, to attack boldly the\r\nKing's friends, and into the midst of the discontent was thrown a message\r\nfrom the Crown asking for half a million, to make good a shortcoming in\r\nthe Civil List.  Men asked in vain what had been done with the lost\r\nmoney.  Confusion at home was increased by the great conflict with the\r\nAmerican colonies; discontents, ever present, were colonial as well as\r\nhome.  In such a time Burke endeavoured to show by what pilotage he would\r\nhave men weather the storm.\r\n\r\nH. M.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHOUGHTS ON THE PRESENT DISCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an undertaking of some degree of delicacy to examine into the cause\r\nof public disorders.  If a man happens not to succeed in such an inquiry,\r\nhe will be thought weak and visionary; if he touches the true grievance,\r\nthere is a danger that he may come near to persons of weight and\r\nconsequence, who will rather be exasperated at the discovery of their\r\nerrors than thankful for the occasion of correcting them.  If he should\r\nbe obliged to blame the favourites of the people, he will be considered\r\nas the tool of power; if he censures those in power, he will be looked on\r\nas an instrument of faction.  But in all exertions of duty something is\r\nto be hazarded.  In cases of tumult and disorder, our law has invested\r\nevery man, in some sort, with the authority of a magistrate.  When the\r\naffairs of the nation are distracted, private people are, by the spirit\r\nof that law, justified in stepping a little out of their ordinary sphere.\r\nThey enjoy a privilege of somewhat more dignity and effect than that of\r\nidle lamentation over the calamities of their country.  They may look\r\ninto them narrowly; they may reason upon them liberally; and if they\r\nshould be so fortunate as to discover the true source of the mischief,\r\nand to suggest any probable method of removing it, though they may\r\ndisplease the rulers for the day, they are certainly of service to the\r\ncause of Government.  Government is deeply interested in everything\r\nwhich, even through the medium of some temporary uneasiness, may tend\r\nfinally to compose the minds of the subjects, and to conciliate their\r\naffections.  I have nothing to do here with the abstract value of the\r\nvoice of the people.  But as long as reputation, the most precious\r\npossession of every individual, and as long as opinion, the great support\r\nof the State, depend entirely upon that voice, it can never be considered\r\nas a thing of little consequence either to individuals or to Government.\r\nNations are not primarily ruled by laws; less by violence.  Whatever\r\noriginal energy may be supposed either in force or regulation, the\r\noperation of both is, in truth, merely instrumental.  Nations are\r\ngoverned by the same methods, and on the same principles, by which an\r\nindividual without authority is often able to govern those who are his\r\nequals or his superiors, by a knowledge of their temper, and by a\r\njudicious management of it; I mean, when public affairs are steadily and\r\nquietly conducted: not when Government is nothing but a continued scuffle\r\nbetween the magistrate and the multitude, in which sometimes the one and\r\nsometimes the other is uppermost--in which they alternately yield and\r\nprevail, in a series of contemptible victories and scandalous\r\nsubmissions.  The temper of the people amongst whom he presides ought\r\ntherefore to be the first study of a statesman.  And the knowledge of\r\nthis temper it is by no means impossible for him to attain, if he has not\r\nan interest in being ignorant of what it is his duty to learn.\r\n\r\nTo complain of the age we live in, to murmur at the present possessors of\r\npower, to lament the past, to conceive extravagant hopes of the future,\r\nare the common dispositions of the greater part of mankind--indeed, the\r\nnecessary effects of the ignorance and levity of the vulgar.  Such\r\ncomplaints and humours have existed in all times; yet as all times have\r\n_not_ been alike, true political sagacity manifests itself, in\r\ndistinguishing that complaint which only characterises the general\r\ninfirmity of human nature from those which are symptoms of the particular\r\ndistemperature of our own air and season.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nNobody, I believe, will consider it merely as the language of spleen or\r\ndisappointment, if I say that there is something particularly alarming in\r\nthe present conjuncture.  There is hardly a man, in or out of power, who\r\nholds any other language.  That Government is at once dreaded and\r\ncontemned; that the laws are despoiled of all their respected and\r\nsalutary terrors; that their inaction is a subject of ridicule, and their\r\nexertion of abhorrence; that rank, and office, and title, and all the\r\nsolemn plausibilities of the world, have lost their reverence and effect;\r\nthat our foreign politics are as much deranged as our domestic economy;\r\nthat our dependencies are slackened in their affection, and loosened from\r\ntheir obedience; that we know neither how to yield nor how to enforce;\r\nthat hardly anything above or below, abroad or at home, is sound and\r\nentire; but that disconnection and confusion, in offices, in parties, in\r\nfamilies, in Parliament, in the nation, prevail beyond the disorders of\r\nany former time: these are facts universally admitted and lamented.\r\n\r\nThis state of things is the more extraordinary, because the great parties\r\nwhich formerly divided and agitated the kingdom are known to be in a\r\nmanner entirely dissolved.  No great external calamity has visited the\r\nnation; no pestilence or famine.  We do not labour at present under any\r\nscheme of taxation new or oppressive in the quantity or in the mode.  Nor\r\nare we engaged in unsuccessful war, in which our misfortunes might easily\r\npervert our judgment, and our minds, sore from the loss of national\r\nglory, might feel every blow of fortune as a crime in Government.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nIt is impossible that the cause of this strange distemper should not\r\nsometimes become a subject of discourse.  It is a compliment due, and\r\nwhich I willingly pay, to those who administer our affairs, to take\r\nnotice in the first place of their speculation.  Our Ministers are of\r\nopinion that the increase of our trade and manufactures, that our growth\r\nby colonisation and by conquest, have concurred to accumulate immense\r\nwealth in the hands of some individuals; and this again being dispersed\r\namongst the people, has rendered them universally proud, ferocious, and\r\nungovernable; that the insolence of some from their enormous wealth, and\r\nthe boldness of others from a guilty poverty, have rendered them capable\r\nof the most atrocious attempts; so that they have trampled upon all\r\nsubordination, and violently borne down the unarmed laws of a free\r\nGovernment--barriers too feeble against the fury of a populace so fierce\r\nand licentious as ours.  They contend that no adequate provocation has\r\nbeen given for so spreading a discontent, our affairs having been\r\nconducted throughout with remarkable temper and consummate wisdom.  The\r\nwicked industry of some libellers, joined to the intrigues of a few\r\ndisappointed politicians, have, in their opinion, been able to produce\r\nthis unnatural ferment in the nation.\r\n\r\nNothing indeed can be more unnatural than the present convulsions of this\r\ncountry, if the above account be a true one.  I confess I shall assent to\r\nit with great reluctance, and only on the compulsion of the clearest and\r\nfirmest proofs; because their account resolves itself into this short but\r\ndiscouraging proposition, \"That we have a very good Ministry, but that we\r\nare a very bad people;\" that we set ourselves to bite the hand that feeds\r\nus; that with a malignant insanity we oppose the measures, and\r\nungratefully vilify the persons, of those whose sole object is our own\r\npeace and prosperity.  If a few puny libellers, acting under a knot of\r\nfactious politicians, without virtue, parts, or character (such they are\r\nconstantly represented by these gentlemen), are sufficient to excite this\r\ndisturbance, very perverse must be the disposition of that people amongst\r\nwhom such a disturbance can be excited by such means.  It is besides no\r\nsmall aggravation of the public misfortune that the disease, on this\r\nhypothesis, appears to be without remedy.  If the wealth of the nation be\r\nthe cause of its turbulence, I imagine it is not proposed to introduce\r\npoverty as a constable to keep the peace.  If our dominions abroad are\r\nthe roots which feed all this rank luxuriance of sedition, it is not\r\nintended to cut them off in order to famish the fruit.  If our liberty\r\nhas enfeebled the executive power, there is no design, I hope, to call in\r\nthe aid of despotism to fill up the deficiencies of law.  Whatever may be\r\nintended, these things are not yet professed.  We seem therefore to be\r\ndriven to absolute despair, for we have no other materials to work upon\r\nbut those out of which God has been pleased to form the inhabitants of\r\nthis island.  If these be radically and essentially vicious, all that can\r\nbe said is that those men are very unhappy to whose fortune or duty it\r\nfalls to administer the affairs of this untoward people.  I hear it\r\nindeed sometimes asserted that a steady perseverance in the present\r\nmeasures, and a rigorous punishment of those who oppose them, will in\r\ncourse of time infallibly put an end to these disorders.  But this, in my\r\nopinion, is said without much observation of our present disposition, and\r\nwithout any knowledge at all of the general nature of mankind.  If the\r\nmatter of which this nation is composed be so very fermentable as these\r\ngentlemen describe it, leaven never will be wanting to work it up, as\r\nlong as discontent, revenge, and ambition have existence in the world.\r\nParticular punishments are the cure for accidental distempers in the\r\nState; they inflame rather than allay those heats which arise from the\r\nsettled mismanagement of the Government, or from a natural ill\r\ndisposition in the people.  It is of the utmost moment not to make\r\nmistakes in the use of strong measures, and firmness is then only a\r\nvirtue when it accompanies the most perfect wisdom.  In truth,\r\ninconstancy is a sort of natural corrective of folly and ignorance.\r\n\r\nI am not one of those who think that the people are never in the wrong.\r\nThey have been so, frequently and outrageously, both in other countries\r\nand in this.  But I do say that in all disputes between them and their\r\nrulers the presumption is at least upon a par in favour of the people.\r\nExperience may perhaps justify me in going further.  When popular\r\ndiscontents have been very prevalent, it may well be affirmed and\r\nsupported that there has been generally something found amiss in the\r\nconstitution or in the conduct of Government.  The people have no\r\ninterest in disorder.  When they do wrong, it is their error, and not\r\ntheir crime.  But with the governing part of the State it is far\r\notherwise.  They certainly may act ill by design, as well as by mistake.\r\n\"Les revolutions qui arrivent dans les grands etats ne sont point un\r\neffect du hasard, ni du caprice des peuples.  Rien ne revolte les grands\r\nd'un royaume comme un Gouvernoment foible et derange.  Pour la populace,\r\nce n'est jamais par envie d'attaquer qu'elle se souleve, mais par\r\nimpatience de souffrir.\"  These are the words of a great man, of a\r\nMinister of State, and a zealous assertor of Monarchy.  They are applied\r\nto the system of favouritism which was adopted by Henry the Third of\r\nFrance, and to the dreadful consequences it produced.  What he says of\r\nrevolutions is equally true of all great disturbances.  If this\r\npresumption in favour of the subjects against the trustees of power be\r\nnot the more probable, I am sure it is the more comfortable speculation,\r\nbecause it is more easy to change an Administration than to reform a\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nUpon a supposition, therefore, that, in the opening of the cause, the\r\npresumptions stand equally balanced between the parties, there seems\r\nsufficient ground to entitle any person to a fair hearing who attempts\r\nsome other scheme besides that easy one which is fashionable in some\r\nfashionable companies, to account for the present discontents.  It is not\r\nto be argued that we endure no grievance, because our grievances are not\r\nof the same sort with those under which we laboured formerly--not\r\nprecisely those which we bore from the Tudors, or vindicated on the\r\nStuarts.  A great change has taken place in the affairs of this country.\r\nFor in the silent lapse of events as material alterations have been\r\ninsensibly brought about in the policy and character of governments and\r\nnations as those which have been marked by the tumult of public\r\nrevolutions.\r\n\r\nIt is very rare indeed for men to be wrong in their feelings concerning\r\npublic misconduct; as rare to be right in their speculation upon the\r\ncause of it.  I have constantly observed that the generality of people\r\nare fifty years, at least, behindhand in their politics.  There are but\r\nvery few who are capable of comparing and digesting what passes before\r\ntheir eyes at different times and occasions, so as to form the whole into\r\na distinct system.  But in books everything is settled for them, without\r\nthe exertion of any considerable diligence or sagacity.  For which reason\r\nmen are wise with but little reflection, and good with little\r\nself-denial, in the business of all times except their own.  We are very\r\nuncorrupt and tolerably enlightened judges of the transactions of past\r\nages; where no passions deceive, and where the whole train of\r\ncircumstances, from the trifling cause to the tragical event, is set in\r\nan orderly series before us.  Few are the partisans of departed tyranny;\r\nand to be a Whig on the business of a hundred years ago is very\r\nconsistent with every advantage of present servility.  This retrospective\r\nwisdom and historical patriotism are things of wonderful convenience, and\r\nserve admirably to reconcile the old quarrel between speculation and\r\npractice.  Many a stern republican, after gorging himself with a full\r\nfeast of admiration of the Grecian commonwealths and of our true Saxon\r\nconstitution, and discharging all the splendid bile of his virtuous\r\nindignation on King John and King James, sits down perfectly satisfied to\r\nthe coarsest work and homeliest job of the day he lives in.  I believe\r\nthere was no professed admirer of Henry the Eighth among the instruments\r\nof the last King James; nor in the court of Henry the Eighth was there, I\r\ndare say, to be found a single advocate for the favourites of Richard the\r\nSecond.\r\n\r\nNo complaisance to our Court, or to our age, can make me believe nature\r\nto be so changed but that public liberty will be among us, as among our\r\nancestors, obnoxious to some person or other, and that opportunities will\r\nbe furnished for attempting, at least, some alteration to the prejudice\r\nof our constitution.  These attempts will naturally vary in their mode,\r\naccording to times and circumstances.  For ambition, though it has ever\r\nthe same general views, has not at all times the same means, nor the same\r\nparticular objects.  A great deal of the furniture of ancient tyranny is\r\nworn to rags; the rest is entirely out of fashion.  Besides, there are\r\nfew statesmen so very clumsy and awkward in their business as to fall\r\ninto the identical snare which has proved fatal to their predecessors.\r\nWhen an arbitrary imposition is attempted upon the subject, undoubtedly\r\nit will not bear on its forehead the name of _Ship-money_.  There is no\r\ndanger that an extension of the _Forest laws_ should be the chosen mode\r\nof oppression in this age.  And when we hear any instance of ministerial\r\nrapacity to the prejudice of the rights of private life, it will\r\ncertainly not be the exaction of two hundred pullets, from a woman of\r\nfashion, for leave to lie with her own husband.\r\n\r\nEvery age has its own manners, and its politics dependent upon them; and\r\nthe same attempts will not be made against a constitution fully formed\r\nand matured, that were used to destroy it in the cradle, or to resist its\r\ngrowth during its infancy.\r\n\r\nAgainst the being of Parliament, I am satisfied, no designs have ever\r\nbeen entertained since the Revolution.  Every one must perceive that it\r\nis strongly the interest of the Court to have some second cause\r\ninterposed between the Ministers and the people.  The gentlemen of the\r\nHouse of Commons have an interest equally strong in sustaining the part\r\nof that intermediate cause.  However they may hire out the _usufruct_ of\r\ntheir voices, they never will part with the _fee and inheritance_.\r\nAccordingly those who have been of the most known devotion to the will\r\nand pleasure of a Court, have at the same time been most forward in\r\nasserting a high authority in the House of Commons.  When they knew who\r\nwere to use that authority, and how it was to be employed, they thought\r\nit never could be carried too far.  It must be always the wish of an\r\nunconstitutional statesman, that a House of Commons who are entirely\r\ndependent upon him, should have every right of the people entirely\r\ndependent upon their pleasure.  It was soon discovered that the forms of\r\na free, and the ends of an arbitrary Government, were things not\r\naltogether incompatible.\r\n\r\nThe power of the Crown, almost dead and rotten as Prerogative, has grown\r\nup anew, with much more strength, and far less odium, under the name of\r\nInfluence.  An influence which operated without noise and without\r\nviolence; an influence which converted the very antagonist into the\r\ninstrument of power; which contained in itself a perpetual principle of\r\ngrowth and renovation; and which the distresses and the prosperity of the\r\ncountry equally tended to augment, was an admirable substitute for a\r\nprerogative that, being only the offspring of antiquated prejudices, had\r\nmoulded in its original stamina irresistible principles of decay and\r\ndissolution.  The ignorance of the people is a bottom but for a temporary\r\nsystem; the interest of active men in the State is a foundation perpetual\r\nand infallible.  However, some circumstances, arising, it must be\r\nconfessed, in a great degree from accident, prevented the effects of this\r\ninfluence for a long time from breaking out in a manner capable of\r\nexciting any serious apprehensions.  Although Government was strong and\r\nflourished exceedingly, the _Court_ had drawn far less advantage than one\r\nwould imagine from this great source of power.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAt the Revolution, the Crown, deprived, for the ends of the Revolution\r\nitself, of many prerogatives, was found too weak to struggle against all\r\nthe difficulties which pressed so new and unsettled a Government.  The\r\nCourt was obliged therefore to delegate a part of its powers to men of\r\nsuch interest as could support, and of such fidelity as would adhere to,\r\nits establishment.  Such men were able to draw in a greater number to a\r\nconcurrence in the common defence.  This connection, necessary at first,\r\ncontinued long after convenient; and properly conducted might indeed, in\r\nall situations, be a useful instrument of Government.  At the same time,\r\nthrough the intervention of men of popular weight and character, the\r\npeople possessed a security for their just proportion of importance in\r\nthe State.  But as the title to the Crown grew stronger by long\r\npossession, and by the constant increase of its influence, these helps\r\nhave of late seemed to certain persons no better than incumbrances.  The\r\npowerful managers for Government were not sufficiently submissive to the\r\npleasure of the possessors of immediate and personal favour, sometimes\r\nfrom a confidence in their own strength, natural and acquired; sometimes\r\nfrom a fear of offending their friends, and weakening that lead in the\r\ncountry, which gave them a consideration independent of the Court.  Men\r\nacted as if the Court could receive, as well as confer, an obligation.\r\nThe influence of Government, thus divided in appearance between the Court\r\nand the leaders of parties, became in many cases an accession rather to\r\nthe popular than to the royal scale; and some part of that influence,\r\nwhich would otherwise have been possessed as in a sort of mortmain and\r\nunalienable domain, returned again to the great ocean from whence it\r\narose, and circulated among the people.  This method therefore of\r\ngoverning by men of great natural interest or great acquired\r\nconsideration, was viewed in a very invidious light by the true lovers of\r\nabsolute monarchy.  It is the nature of despotism to abhor power held by\r\nany means but its own momentary pleasure; and to annihilate all\r\nintermediate situations between boundless strength on its own part, and\r\ntotal debility on the part of the people.\r\n\r\nTo get rid of all this intermediate and independent importance, and _to\r\nsecure to the Court the unlimited and uncontrolled use of its own vast\r\ninfluence_, _under the sole direction of its own private favour_, has for\r\nsome years past been the great object of policy.  If this were compassed,\r\nthe influence of the Crown must of course produce all the effects which\r\nthe most sanguine partisans of the Court could possibly desire.\r\nGovernment might then be carried on without any concurrence on the part\r\nof the people; without any attention to the dignity of the greater, or to\r\nthe affections of the lower sorts.  A new project was therefore devised\r\nby a certain set of intriguing men, totally different from the system of\r\nAdministration which had prevailed since the accession of the House of\r\nBrunswick.  This project, I have heard, was first conceived by some\r\npersons in the Court of Frederick, Prince of Wales.\r\n\r\nThe earliest attempt in the execution of this design was to set up for\r\nMinister a person, in rank indeed respectable, and very ample in fortune;\r\nbut who, to the moment of this vast and sudden elevation, was little\r\nknown or considered in the kingdom.  To him the whole nation was to yield\r\nan immediate and implicit submission.  But whether it was from want of\r\nfirmness to bear up against the first opposition, or that things were not\r\nyet fully ripened, or that this method was not found the most eligible,\r\nthat idea was soon abandoned.  The instrumental part of the project was a\r\nlittle altered, to accommodate it to the time, and to bring things more\r\ngradually and more surely to the one great end proposed.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the reformed plan was to draw _a line which should\r\nseparate the Court from the Ministry_.  Hitherto these names had been\r\nlooked upon as synonymous; but, for the future, Court and Administration\r\nwere to be considered as things totally distinct.  By this operation, two\r\nsystems of Administration were to be formed: one which should be in the\r\nreal secret and confidence; the other merely ostensible, to perform the\r\nofficial and executory duties of Government.  The latter were alone to be\r\nresponsible; whilst the real advisers, who enjoyed all the power, were\r\neffectually removed from all the danger.\r\n\r\nSecondly, _a party under these leaders was to be formed in favour of the\r\nCourt against the Ministry_: this party was to have a large share in the\r\nemoluments of Government, and to hold it totally separate from, and\r\nindependent of, ostensible Administration.\r\n\r\nThe third point, and that on which the success of the whole scheme\r\nultimately depended, was _to bring Parliament to an acquiescence in this\r\nproject_.  Parliament was therefore to be taught by degrees a total\r\nindifference to the persons, rank, influence, abilities, connections, and\r\ncharacter of the Ministers of the Crown.  By means of a discipline, on\r\nwhich I shall say more hereafter, that body was to be habituated to the\r\nmost opposite interests, and the most discordant politics.  All\r\nconnections and dependencies among subjects were to be entirely\r\ndissolved.  As hitherto business had gone through the hands of leaders of\r\nWhigs or Tories, men of talents to conciliate the people, and to engage\r\ntheir confidence, now the method was to be altered; and the lead was to\r\nbe given to men of no sort of consideration or credit in the country.\r\nThis want of natural importance was to be their very title to delegated\r\npower.  Members of parliament were to be hardened into an insensibility\r\nto pride as well as to duty.  Those high and haughty sentiments, which\r\nare the great support of independence, were to be let down gradually.\r\nPoint of honour and precedence were no more to be regarded in\r\nParliamentary decorum than in a Turkish army.  It was to be avowed, as a\r\nconstitutional maxim, that the King might appoint one of his footmen, or\r\none of your footmen, for Minister; and that he ought to be, and that he\r\nwould be, as well followed as the first name for rank or wisdom in the\r\nnation.  Thus Parliament was to look on, as if perfectly unconcerned\r\nwhile a cabal of the closet and back-stairs was substituted in the place\r\nof a national Administration.\r\n\r\nWith such a degree of acquiescence, any measure of any Court might well\r\nbe deemed thoroughly secure.  The capital objects, and by much the most\r\nflattering characteristics of arbitrary power, would be obtained.\r\nEverything would be drawn from its holdings in the country to the\r\npersonal favour and inclination of the Prince.  This favour would be the\r\nsole introduction to power, and the only tenure by which it was to be\r\nheld: so that no person looking towards another, and all looking towards\r\nthe Court, it was impossible but that the motive which solely influenced\r\nevery man's hopes must come in time to govern every man's conduct; till\r\nat last the servility became universal, in spite of the dead letter of\r\nany laws or institutions whatsoever.\r\n\r\nHow it should happen that any man could be tempted to venture upon such a\r\nproject of Government, may at first view appear surprising.  But the fact\r\nis that opportunities very inviting to such an attempt have offered; and\r\nthe scheme itself was not destitute of some arguments, not wholly\r\nunplausible, to recommend it.  These opportunities and these arguments,\r\nthe use that has been made of both, the plan for carrying this new scheme\r\nof government into execution, and the effects which it has produced, are\r\nin my opinion worthy of our serious consideration.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty came to the throne of these kingdoms with more advantages\r\nthan any of his predecessors since the Revolution.  Fourth in descent,\r\nand third in succession of his Royal family, even the zealots of\r\nhereditary right, in him, saw something to flatter their favourite\r\nprejudices; and to justify a transfer of their attachments, without a\r\nchange in their principles.  The person and cause of the Pretender were\r\nbecome contemptible; his title disowned throughout Europe, his party\r\ndisbanded in England.  His Majesty came indeed to the inheritance of a\r\nmighty war; but, victorious in every part of the globe, peace was always\r\nin his power, not to negotiate, but to dictate.  No foreign habitudes or\r\nattachments withdrew him from the cultivation of his power at home.  His\r\nrevenue for the Civil establishment, fixed (as it was then thought) at a\r\nlarge, but definite sum, was ample, without being invidious; his\r\ninfluence, by additions from conquest, by an augmentation of debt, by an\r\nincrease of military and naval establishment, much strengthened and\r\nextended.  And coming to the throne in the prime and full vigour of\r\nyouth, as from affection there was a strong dislike, so from dread there\r\nseemed to be a general averseness from giving anything like offence to a\r\nmonarch against whose resentment opposition could not look for a refuge\r\nin any sort of reversionary hope.\r\n\r\nThese singular advantages inspired his Majesty only with a more ardent\r\ndesire to preserve unimpaired the spirit of that national freedom to\r\nwhich he owed a situation so full of glory.  But to others it suggested\r\nsentiments of a very different nature.  They thought they now beheld an\r\nopportunity (by a certain sort of statesman never long undiscovered or\r\nunemployed) of drawing to themselves, by the aggrandisement of a Court\r\nfaction, a degree of power which they could never hope to derive from\r\nnatural influence or from honourable service; and which it was impossible\r\nthey could hold with the least security, whilst the system of\r\nAdministration rested upon its former bottom.  In order to facilitate the\r\nexecution of their design, it was necessary to make many alterations in\r\npolitical arrangement, and a signal change in the opinions, habits, and\r\nconnections of the greater part of those who at that time acted in\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they proceeded gradually, but not slowly, to destroy\r\neverything of strength which did not derive its principal nourishment\r\nfrom the immediate pleasure of the Court.  The greatest weight of popular\r\nopinion and party connection were then with the Duke of Newcastle and Mr.\r\nPitt.  Neither of these held his importance by the _new tenure_ of the\r\nCourt; they were not, therefore, thought to be so proper as others for\r\nthe services which were required by that tenure.  It happened very\r\nfavourably for the new system, that under a forced coalition there\r\nrankled an incurable alienation and disgust between the parties which\r\ncomposed the Administration.  Mr. Pitt was first attacked.  Not satisfied\r\nwith removing him from power, they endeavoured by various artifices to\r\nruin his character.  The other party seemed rather pleased to get rid of\r\nso oppressive a support; not perceiving that their own fall was prepared\r\nby his, and involved in it.  Many other reasons prevented them from\r\ndaring to look their true situation in the face.  To the great Whig\r\nfamilies it was extremely disagreeable, and seemed almost unnatural, to\r\noppose the Administration of a Prince of the House of Brunswick.  Day\r\nafter day they hesitated, and doubted, and lingered, expecting that other\r\ncounsels would take place; and were slow to be persuaded that all which\r\nhad been done by the Cabal was the effect, not of humour, but of system.\r\nIt was more strongly and evidently the interest of the new Court faction\r\nto get rid of the great Whig connections than to destroy Mr. Pitt.  The\r\npower of that gentleman was vast indeed, and merited; but it was in a\r\ngreat degree personal, and therefore transient.  Theirs was rooted in the\r\ncountry.  For, with a good deal less of popularity, they possessed a far\r\nmore natural and fixed influence.  Long possession of Government; vast\r\nproperty; obligations of favours given and received; connection of\r\noffice; ties of blood, of alliance, of friendship (things at that time\r\nsupposed of some force); the name of Whig, dear to the majority of the\r\npeople; the zeal early begun and steadily continued to the Royal Family;\r\nall these together formed a body of power in the nation, which was\r\ncriminal and devoted.  The great ruling principle of the Cabal, and that\r\nwhich animated and harmonised all their proceedings, how various soever\r\nthey may have been, was to signify to the world that the Court would\r\nproceed upon its own proper forces only; and that the pretence of\r\nbringing any other into its service was an affront to it, and not a\r\nsupport.  Therefore when the chiefs were removed, in order to go to the\r\nroot, the whole party was put under a proscription, so general and severe\r\nas to take their hard-earned bread from the lowest officers, in a manner\r\nwhich had never been known before, even in general revolutions.  But it\r\nwas thought necessary effectually to destroy all dependencies but one,\r\nand to show an example of the firmness and rigour with which the new\r\nsystem was to be supported.\r\n\r\nThus for the time were pulled down, in the persons of the Whig leaders\r\nand of Mr. Pitt (in spite of the services of the one at the accession of\r\nthe Royal Family, and the recent services of the other in the war), the\r\n_two only securities for the importance of the people_: _power arising\r\nfrom popularity_, _and power arising from connection_.  Here and there\r\nindeed a few individuals were left standing, who gave security for their\r\ntotal estrangement from the odious principles of party connection and\r\npersonal attachment; and it must be confessed that most of them have\r\nreligiously kept their faith.  Such a change could not, however, be made\r\nwithout a mighty shock to Government.\r\n\r\nTo reconcile the minds of the people to all these movements, principles\r\ncorrespondent to them had been preached up with great zeal.  Every one\r\nmust remember that the Cabal set out with the most astonishing prudery,\r\nboth moral and political.  Those who in a few months after soused over\r\nhead and ears into the deepest and dirtiest pits of corruption, cried out\r\nviolently against the indirect practices in the electing and managing of\r\nParliaments, which had formerly prevailed.  This marvellous abhorrence\r\nwhich the Court had suddenly taken to all influence, was not only\r\ncirculated in conversation through the kingdom, but pompously announced\r\nto the public, with many other extraordinary things, in a pamphlet which\r\nhad all the appearance of a manifesto preparatory to some considerable\r\nenterprise.  Throughout, it was a satire, though in terms managed and\r\ndecent enough, on the politics of the former reign.  It was indeed\r\nwritten with no small art and address.\r\n\r\nIn this piece appeared the first dawning of the new system; there first\r\nappeared the idea (then only in speculation) of _separating the Court\r\nfrom the Administration_; of carrying everything from national connection\r\nto personal regards; and of forming a regular party for that purpose,\r\nunder the name of _King's men_.\r\n\r\nTo recommend this system to the people, a perspective view of the Court,\r\ngorgeously painted, and finely illuminated from within, was exhibited to\r\nthe gaping multitude.  Party was to be totally done away, with all its\r\nevil works.  Corruption was to be cast down from Court, as _Ate_ was from\r\nheaven.  Power was thenceforward to be the chosen residence of public\r\nspirit; and no one was to be supposed under any sinister influence,\r\nexcept those who had the misfortune to be in disgrace at Court, which was\r\nto stand in lieu of all vices and all corruptions.  A scheme of\r\nperfection to be realised in a Monarchy, far beyond the visionary\r\nRepublic of Plato.  The whole scenery was exactly disposed to captivate\r\nthose good souls, whose credulous morality is so invaluable a treasure to\r\ncrafty politicians.  Indeed, there was wherewithal to charm everybody,\r\nexcept those few who are not much pleased with professions of\r\nsupernatural virtue, who know of what stuff such professions are made,\r\nfor what purposes they are designed, and in what they are sure constantly\r\nto end.  Many innocent gentlemen, who had been talking prose all their\r\nlives without knowing anything of the matter, began at last to open their\r\neyes upon their own merits, and to attribute their not having been Lords\r\nof the Treasury and Lords of Trade many years before merely to the\r\nprevalence of party, and to the Ministerial power, which had frustrated\r\nthe good intentions of the Court in favour of their abilities.  Now was\r\nthe time to unlock the sealed fountain of Royal bounty, which had been\r\ninfamously monopolised and huckstered, and to let it flow at large upon\r\nthe whole people.  The time was come to restore Royalty to its original\r\nsplendour.  _Mettre le Roy hors de page_, became a sort of watchword.  And\r\nit was constantly in the mouths of all the runners of the Court, that\r\nnothing could preserve the balance of the constitution from being\r\noverturned by the rabble, or by a faction of the nobility, but to free\r\nthe Sovereign effectually from that Ministerial tyranny under which the\r\nRoyal dignity had been oppressed in the person of his Majesty's\r\ngrandfather.\r\n\r\nThese were some of the many artifices used to reconcile the people to the\r\ngreat change which was made in the persons who composed the Ministry, and\r\nthe still greater which was made and avowed in its constitution.  As to\r\nindividuals, other methods were employed with them, in order so\r\nthoroughly to disunite every party, and even every family, that _no\r\nconcert_, _order_, _or effect_, _might appear in any future opposition_.\r\nAnd in this manner an Administration without connection with the people,\r\nor with one another, was first put in possession of Government.  What\r\ngood consequences followed from it, we have all seen; whether with regard\r\nto virtue, public or private; to the ease and happiness of the Sovereign;\r\nor to the real strength of Government.  But as so much stress was then\r\nlaid on the necessity of this new project, it will not be amiss to take a\r\nview of the effects of this Royal servitude and vile durance, which was\r\nso deplored in the reign of the late Monarch, and was so carefully to be\r\navoided in the reign of his successor.  The effects were these.\r\n\r\nIn times full of doubt and danger to his person and family, George the\r\nSecond maintained the dignity of his Crown connected with the liberty of\r\nhis people, not only unimpaired, but improved, for the space of thirty-\r\nthree years.  He overcame a dangerous rebellion, abetted by foreign\r\nforce, and raging in the heart of his kingdoms; and thereby destroyed the\r\nseeds of all future rebellion that could arise upon the same principle.\r\nHe carried the glory, the power, the commerce of England, to a height\r\nunknown even to this renowned nation in the times of its greatest\r\nprosperity: and he left his succession resting on the true and only true\r\nfoundation of all national and all regal greatness; affection at home,\r\nreputation abroad, trust in allies, terror in rival nations.  The most\r\nardent lover of his country cannot wish for Great Britain a happier fate\r\nthan to continue as she was then left.  A people emulous as we are in\r\naffection to our present Sovereign, know not how to form a prayer to\r\nHeaven for a greater blessing upon his virtues, or a higher state of\r\nfelicity and glory, than that he should live, and should reign, and, when\r\nProvidence ordains it, should die, exactly like his illustrious\r\npredecessor.\r\n\r\nA great Prince may be obliged (though such a thing cannot happen very\r\noften) to sacrifice his private inclination to his public interest.  A\r\nwise Prince will not think that such a restraint implies a condition of\r\nservility; and truly, if such was the condition of the last reign, and\r\nthe effects were also such as we have described, we ought, no less for\r\nthe sake of the Sovereign whom we love, than for our own, to hear\r\narguments convincing indeed, before we depart from the maxims of that\r\nreign, or fly in the face of this great body of strong and recent\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal topics which was then, and has been since, much\r\nemployed by that political school, is an effectual terror of the growth\r\nof an aristocratic power, prejudicial to the rights of the Crown, and the\r\nbalance of the constitution.  Any new powers exercised in the House of\r\nLords, or in the House of Commons, or by the Crown, ought certainly to\r\nexcite the vigilant and anxious jealousy of a free people.  Even a new\r\nand unprecedented course of action in the whole Legislature, without\r\ngreat and evident reason, may be a subject of just uneasiness.  I will\r\nnot affirm, that there may not have lately appeared in the House of Lords\r\na disposition to some attempts derogatory to the legal rights of the\r\nsubject.  If any such have really appeared, they have arisen, not from a\r\npower properly aristocratic, but from the same influence which is charged\r\nwith having excited attempts of a similar nature in the House of Commons;\r\nwhich House, if it should have been betrayed into an unfortunate quarrel\r\nwith its constituents, and involved in a charge of the very same nature,\r\ncould have neither power nor inclination to repel such attempts in\r\nothers.  Those attempts in the House of Lords can no more be called\r\naristocratic proceedings, than the proceedings with regard to the county\r\nof Middlesex in the House of Commons can with any sense be called\r\ndemocratical.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that the Peers have a great influence in the kingdom, and in\r\nevery part of the public concerns.  While they are men of property, it is\r\nimpossible to prevent it, except by such means as must prevent all\r\nproperty from its natural operation: an event not easily to be compassed,\r\nwhile property is power; nor by any means to be wished, while the least\r\nnotion exists of the method by which the spirit of liberty acts, and of\r\nthe means by which it is preserved.  If any particular Peers, by their\r\nuniform, upright, constitutional conduct, by their public and their\r\nprivate virtues, have acquired an influence in the country; the people on\r\nwhose favour that influence depends, and from whom it arose, will never\r\nbe duped into an opinion, that such greatness in a Peer is the despotism\r\nof an aristocracy, when they know and feel it to be the effect and pledge\r\nof their own importance.\r\n\r\nI am no friend to aristocracy, in the sense at least in which that word\r\nis usually understood.  If it were not a bad habit to moot cases on the\r\nsupposed ruin of the constitution, I should be free to declare, that if\r\nit must perish, I would rather by far see it resolved into any other\r\nform, than lost in that austere and insolent domination.  But, whatever\r\nmy dislikes may be, my fears are not upon that quarter.  The question, on\r\nthe influence of a Court, and of a Peerage, is not, which of the two\r\ndangers is the most eligible, but which is the most imminent.  He is but\r\na poor observer, who has not seen, that the generality of Peers, far from\r\nsupporting themselves in a state of independent greatness, are but too\r\napt to fall into an oblivion of their proper dignity, and to run headlong\r\ninto an abject servitude.  Would to God it were true, that the fault of\r\nour Peers were too much spirit!  It is worthy of some observation, that\r\nthese gentlemen, so jealous of aristocracy, make no complaints of the\r\npower of those peers (neither few nor inconsiderable) who are always in\r\nthe train of a Court, and whose whole weight must be considered as a\r\nportion of the settled influence of the Crown.  This is all safe and\r\nright; but if some Peers (I am very sorry they are not as many as they\r\nought to be) set themselves, in the great concern of Peers and Commons,\r\nagainst a back-stairs influence and clandestine government, then the\r\nalarm begins; then the constitution is in danger of being forced into an\r\naristocracy.\r\n\r\nI rest a little the longer on this Court topic, because it was much\r\ninsisted upon at the time of the great change, and has been since\r\nfrequently revived by many of the agents of that party: for, whilst they\r\nare terrifying the great and opulent with the horrors of mob-government,\r\nthey are by other managers attempting (though hitherto with little\r\nsuccess) to alarm the people with a phantom of tyranny in the Nobles.  All\r\nthis is done upon their favourite principle of disunion, of sowing\r\njealousies amongst the different orders of the State, and of disjointing\r\nthe natural strength of the kingdom; that it may be rendered incapable of\r\nresisting the sinister designs of wicked men, who have engrossed the\r\nRoyal power.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThus much of the topics chosen by the courtiers to recommend their\r\nsystem; it will be necessary to open a little more at large the nature of\r\nthat party which was formed for its support.  Without this, the whole\r\nwould have been no better than a visionary amusement, like the scheme of\r\nHarrington's political club, and not a business in which the nation had a\r\nreal concern.  As a powerful party, and a party constructed on a new\r\nprinciple, it is a very inviting object of curiosity.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered, that since the Revolution, until the period we are\r\nspeaking of, the influence of the Crown had been always employed in\r\nsupporting the Ministers of State, and in carrying on the public business\r\naccording to their opinions.  But the party now in question is formed\r\nupon a very different idea.  It is to intercept the favour, protection,\r\nand confidence of the Crown in the passage to its Ministers; it is to\r\ncome between them and their importance in Parliament; it is to separate\r\nthem from all their natural and acquired dependencies; it is intended as\r\nthe control, not the support, of Administration.  The machinery of this\r\nsystem is perplexed in its movements, and false in its principle.  It is\r\nformed on a supposition that the King is something external to his\r\ngovernment; and that he may be honoured and aggrandised, even by its\r\ndebility and disgrace.  The plan proceeds expressly on the idea of\r\nenfeebling the regular executory power.  It proceeds on the idea of\r\nweakening the State in order to strengthen the Court.  The scheme\r\ndepending entirely on distrust, on disconnection, on mutability by\r\nprinciple, on systematic weakness in every particular member; it is\r\nimpossible that the total result should be substantial strength of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nAs a foundation of their scheme, the Cabal have established a sort of\r\n_Rota_ in the Court.  All sorts of parties, by this means, have been\r\nbrought into Administration, from whence few have had the good fortune to\r\nescape without disgrace; none at all without considerable losses.  In the\r\nbeginning of each arrangement no professions of confidence and support\r\nare wanting, to induce the leading men to engage.  But while the\r\nMinisters of the day appear in all the pomp and pride of power, while\r\nthey have all their canvas spread out to the wind, and every sail filled\r\nwith the fair and prosperous gale of Royal favour, in a short time they\r\nfind, they know not how, a current, which sets directly against them;\r\nwhich prevents all progress, and even drives them backwards.  They grow\r\nashamed and mortified in a situation, which, by its vicinity to power,\r\nonly serves to remind them the more strongly of their insignificance.\r\nThey are obliged either to execute the orders of their inferiors, or to\r\nsee themselves opposed by the natural instruments of their office.  With\r\nthe loss of their dignity, they lose their temper.  In their turn they\r\ngrow troublesome to that Cabal, which, whether it supports or opposes,\r\nequally disgraces and equally betrays them.  It is soon found necessary\r\nto get rid of the heads of Administration; but it is of the heads only.\r\nAs there always are many rotten members belonging to the best\r\nconnections, it is not hard to persuade several to continue in office\r\nwithout their leaders.  By this means the party goes out much thinner\r\nthan it came in; and is only reduced in strength by its temporary\r\npossession of power.  Besides, if by accident, or in course of changes,\r\nthat power should be recovered, the Junto have thrown up a retrenchment\r\nof these carcases, which may serve to cover themselves in a day of\r\ndanger.  They conclude, not unwisely, that such rotten members will\r\nbecome the first objects of disgust and resentment to their ancient\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\nThey contrive to form in the outward Administration two parties at the\r\nleast; which, whilst they are tearing one another to pieces, are both\r\ncompetitors for the favour and protection of the Cabal; and, by their\r\nemulation, contribute to throw everything more and more into the hands of\r\nthe interior managers.\r\n\r\nA Minister of State will sometimes keep himself totally estranged from\r\nall his colleagues; will differ from them in their counsels, will\r\nprivately traverse, and publicly oppose, their measures.  He will,\r\nhowever, continue in his employment.  Instead of suffering any mark of\r\ndispleasure, he will be distinguished by an unbounded profusion of Court\r\nrewards and caresses; because he does what is expected, and all that is\r\nexpected, from men in office.  He helps to keep some form of\r\nAdministration in being, and keeps it at the same time as weak and\r\ndivided as possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, we must take care not to be mistaken, or to imagine that such\r\npersons have any weight in their opposition.  When, by them,\r\nAdministration is convinced of its insignificancy, they are soon to be\r\nconvinced of their own.  They never are suffered to succeed in their\r\nopposition.  They and the world are to be satisfied, that neither office,\r\nnor authority, nor property, nor ability, eloquence, counsel, skill, or\r\nunion, are of the least importance; but that the mere influence of the\r\nCourt, naked of all support, and destitute of all management, is\r\nabundantly sufficient for all its own purposes.\r\n\r\nWhen any adverse connection is to be destroyed, the Cabal seldom appear\r\nin the work themselves.  They find out some person of whom the party\r\nentertains a high opinion.  Such a person they endeavour to delude with\r\nvarious pretences.  They teach him first to distrust, and then to quarrel\r\nwith his friends; among whom, by the same arts, they excite a similar\r\ndiffidence of him; so that in this mutual fear and distrust, he may\r\nsuffer himself to be employed as the instrument in the change which is\r\nbrought about.  Afterwards they are sure to destroy him in his turn; by\r\nsetting up in his place some person in whom he had himself reposed the\r\ngreatest confidence, and who serves to carry on a considerable part of\r\nhis adherents.\r\n\r\nWhen such a person has broke in this manner with his connections, he is\r\nsoon compelled to commit some flagrant act of iniquitous personal\r\nhostility against some of them (such as an attempt to strip a particular\r\nfriend of his family estate), by which the Cabal hope to render the\r\nparties utterly irreconcilable.  In truth, they have so contrived\r\nmatters, that people have a greater hatred to the subordinate instruments\r\nthan to the principal movers.\r\n\r\nAs in destroying their enemies they make use of instruments not\r\nimmediately belonging to their corps, so in advancing their own friends\r\nthey pursue exactly the same method.  To promote any of them to\r\nconsiderable rank or emolument, they commonly take care that the\r\nrecommendation shall pass through the hands of the ostensible Ministry:\r\nsuch a recommendation might, however, appear to the world as some proof\r\nof the credit of Ministers, and some means of increasing their strength.\r\nTo prevent this, the persons so advanced are directed in all companies,\r\nindustriously to declare, that they are under no obligations whatsoever\r\nto Administration; that they have received their office from another\r\nquarter; that they are totally free and independent.\r\n\r\nWhen the Faction has any job of lucre to obtain, or of vengeance to\r\nperpetrate, their way is, to select, for the execution, those very\r\npersons to whose habits, friendships, principles, and declarations, such\r\nproceedings are publicly known to be the most adverse; at once to render\r\nthe instruments the more odious, and therefore the more dependent, and to\r\nprevent the people from ever reposing a confidence in any appearance of\r\nprivate friendship, or public principle.\r\n\r\nIf the Administration seem now and then, from remissness, or from fear of\r\nmaking themselves disagreeable, to suffer any popular excesses to go\r\nunpunished, the Cabal immediately sets up some creature of theirs to\r\nraise a clamour against the Ministers, as having shamefully betrayed the\r\ndignity of Government.  Then they compel the Ministry to become active in\r\nconferring rewards and honours on the persons who have been the\r\ninstruments of their disgrace; and, after having first vilified them with\r\nthe higher orders for suffering the laws to sleep over the licentiousness\r\nof the populace, they drive them (in order to make amends for their\r\nformer inactivity) to some act of atrocious violence, which renders them\r\ncompletely abhorred by the people.  They who remember the riots which\r\nattended the Middlesex Election; the opening of the present Parliament;\r\nand the transactions relative to Saint George's Fields, will not be at a\r\nloss for an application of these remarks.\r\n\r\nThat this body may be enabled to compass all the ends of its institution,\r\nits members are scarcely ever to aim at the high and responsible offices\r\nof the State.  They are distributed with art and judgment through all the\r\nsecondary, but efficient, departments of office, and through the\r\nhouseholds of all the branches of the Royal Family: so as on one hand to\r\noccupy all the avenues to the Throne; and on the other to forward or\r\nfrustrate the execution of any measure, according to their own interests.\r\nFor with the credit and support which they are known to have, though for\r\nthe greater part in places which are only a genteel excuse for salary,\r\nthey possess all the influence of the highest posts; and they dictate\r\npublicly in almost everything, even with a parade of superiority.\r\nWhenever they dissent (as it often happens) from their nominal leaders,\r\nthe trained part of the Senate, instinctively in the secret, is sure to\r\nfollow them; provided the leaders, sensible of their situation, do not of\r\nthemselves recede in time from their most declared opinions.  This latter\r\nis generally the case.  It will not be conceivable to any one who has not\r\nseen it, what pleasure is taken by the Cabal in rendering these heads of\r\noffice thoroughly contemptible and ridiculous.  And when they are become\r\nso, they have then the best chance, for being well supported.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Court faction are fully indemnified for not holding\r\nplaces on the slippery heights of the kingdom, not only by the lead in\r\nall affairs, but also by the perfect security in which they enjoy less\r\nconspicuous, but very advantageous, situations.  Their places are, in\r\nexpress legal tenure, or in effect, all of them for life.  Whilst the\r\nfirst and most respectable persons in the kingdom are tossed about like\r\ntennis balls, the sport of a blind and insolent caprice, no Minister\r\ndares even to cast an oblique glance at the lowest of their body.  If an\r\nattempt be made upon one of this corps, immediately he flies to\r\nsanctuary, and pretends to the most inviolable of all promises.  No\r\nconveniency of public arrangement is available to remove any one of them\r\nfrom the specific situation he holds; and the slightest attempt upon one\r\nof them, by the most powerful Minister, is a certain preliminary to his\r\nown destruction.\r\n\r\nConscious of their independence, they bear themselves with a lofty air to\r\nthe exterior Ministers.  Like Janissaries, they derive a kind of freedom\r\nfrom the very condition of their servitude.  They may act just as they\r\nplease; provided they are true to the great ruling principle of their\r\ninstitution.  It is, therefore, not at all wonderful, that people should\r\nbe so desirous of adding themselves to that body, in which they may\r\npossess and reconcile satisfactions the most alluring, and seemingly the\r\nmost contradictory; enjoying at once all the spirited pleasure of\r\nindependence, and all the gross lucre and fat emoluments of servitude.\r\n\r\nHere is a sketch, though a slight one, of the constitution, laws, and\r\npolicy, of this new Court corporation.  The name by which they choose to\r\ndistinguish themselves, is that of _King's men_, or the _King's friends_,\r\nby an invidious exclusion of the rest of his Majesty's most loyal and\r\naffectionate subjects.  The whole system, comprehending the exterior and\r\ninterior Administrations, is commonly called, in the technical language\r\nof the Court, _Double Cabinet_; in French or English, as you choose to\r\npronounce it.\r\n\r\nWhether all this be a vision of a distracted brain, or the invention of a\r\nmalicious heart, or a real faction in the country, must be judged by the\r\nappearances which things have worn for eight years past.  Thus far I am\r\ncertain, that there is not a single public man, in or out of office, who\r\nhas not, at some time or other, borne testimony to the truth of what I\r\nhave now related.  In particular, no persons have been more strong in\r\ntheir assertions, and louder and more indecent in their complaints, than\r\nthose who compose all the exterior part of the present Administration; in\r\nwhose time that faction has arrived at such a height of power, and of\r\nboldness in the use of it, as may, in the end, perhaps bring about its\r\ntotal destruction.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that about four years ago, during the administration of the\r\nMarquis of Rockingham, an attempt was made to carry on Government without\r\ntheir concurrence.  However, this was only a transient cloud; they were\r\nhid but for a moment; and their constellation blazed out with greater\r\nbrightness, and a far more vigorous influence, some time after it was\r\nblown over.  An attempt was at that time made (but without any idea of\r\nproscription) to break their corps, to discountenance their doctrines, to\r\nrevive connections of a different kind, to restore the principles and\r\npolicy of the Whigs, to reanimate the cause of Liberty by Ministerial\r\ncountenance; and then for the first time were men seen attached in office\r\nto every principle they had maintained in opposition.  No one will doubt,\r\nthat such men were abhorred and violently opposed by the Court faction,\r\nand that such a system could have but a short duration.\r\n\r\nIt may appear somewhat affected, that in so much discourse upon this\r\nextraordinary party, I should say so little of the Earl of Bute, who is\r\nthe supposed head of it.  But this was neither owing to affectation nor\r\ninadvertence.  I have carefully avoided the introduction of personal\r\nreflections of any kind.  Much the greater part of the topics which have\r\nbeen used to blacken this nobleman are either unjust or frivolous.  At\r\nbest, they have a tendency to give the resentment of this bitter calamity\r\na wrong direction, and to turn a public grievance into a mean personal,\r\nor a dangerous national, quarrel.  Where there is a regular scheme of\r\noperations carried on, it is the system, and not any individual person\r\nwho acts in it, that is truly dangerous.  This system has not risen\r\nsolely from the ambition of Lord Bute, but from the circumstances which\r\nfavoured it, and from an indifference to the constitution which had been\r\nfor some time growing among our gentry.  We should have been tried with\r\nit, if the Earl of Bute had never existed; and it will want neither a\r\ncontriving head nor active members, when the Earl of Bute exists no\r\nlonger.  It is not, therefore, to rail at Lord Bute, but firmly to embody\r\nagainst this Court party and its practices, which can afford us any\r\nprospect of relief in our present condition.\r\n\r\nAnother motive induces me to put the personal consideration of Lord Bute\r\nwholly out of the question.  He communicates very little in a direct\r\nmanner with the greater part of our men of business.  This has never been\r\nhis custom.  It is enough for him that he surrounds them with his\r\ncreatures.  Several imagine, therefore, that they have a very good excuse\r\nfor doing all the work of this faction, when they have no personal\r\nconnection with Lord Bute.  But whoever becomes a party to an\r\nAdministration, composed of insulated individuals, without faith\r\nplighted, tie, or common principle; an Administration constitutionally\r\nimpotent, because supported by no party in the nation; he who contributes\r\nto destroy the connections of men and their trust in one another, or in\r\nany sort to throw the dependence of public counsels upon private will and\r\nfavour, possibly may have nothing to do with the Earl of Bute.  It\r\nmatters little whether he be the friend or the enemy of that particular\r\nperson.  But let him be who or what he will, he abets a faction that is\r\ndriving hard to the ruin of his country.  He is sapping the foundation of\r\nits liberty, disturbing the sources of its domestic tranquillity,\r\nweakening its government over its dependencies, degrading it from all its\r\nimportance in the system of Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is this unnatural infusion of a _system of Favouritism_ into a\r\nGovernment which in a great part of its constitution is popular, that has\r\nraised the present ferment in the nation.  The people, without entering\r\ndeeply into its principles, could plainly perceive its effects, in much\r\nviolence, in a great spirit of innovation, and a general disorder in all\r\nthe functions of Government.  I keep my eye solely on this system; if I\r\nspeak of those measures which have arisen from it, it will be so far only\r\nas they illustrate the general scheme.  This is the fountain of all those\r\nbitter waters of which, through a hundred different conducts, we have\r\ndrunk until we are ready to burst.  The discretionary power of the Crown\r\nin the formation of Ministry, abused by bad or weak men, has given rise\r\nto a system, which, without directly violating the letter of any law,\r\noperates against the spirit of the whole constitution.\r\n\r\nA plan of Favouritism for our executory Government is essentially at\r\nvariance with the plan of our Legislature.  One great end undoubtedly of\r\na mixed Government like ours, composed of Monarchy, and of controls, on\r\nthe part of the higher people and the lower, is that the Prince shall not\r\nbe able to violate the laws.  This is useful indeed and fundamental.  But\r\nthis, even at first view, is no more than a negative advantage; an armour\r\nmerely defensive.  It is therefore next in order, and equal in\r\nimportance, _that the discretionary powers which are necessarily vested\r\nin the Monarch_, _whether for the execution of the laws_, _or for the\r\nnomination to magistracy and office_, _or for conducting the affairs of\r\npeace and war_, _or for ordering the revenue_, _should all be exercised\r\nupon public principles and national grounds_, _and not on the likings or\r\nprejudices_, _the intrigues or policies of a Court_.  This, I said, is\r\nequal in importance to the securing a Government according to law.  The\r\nlaws reach but a very little way.  Constitute Government how you please,\r\ninfinitely the greater part of it must depend upon the exercise of the\r\npowers which are left at large to the prudence and uprightness of\r\nMinisters of State.  Even all the use and potency of the laws depends\r\nupon them.  Without them, your Commonwealth is no better than a scheme\r\nupon paper; and not a living, active, effective constitution.  It is\r\npossible, that through negligence, or ignorance, or design artfully\r\nconducted, Ministers may suffer one part of Government to languish,\r\nanother to be perverted from its purposes: and every valuable interest of\r\nthe country to fall into ruin and decay, without possibility of fixing\r\nany single act on which a criminal prosecution can be justly grounded.\r\nThe due arrangement of men in the active part of the state, far from\r\nbeing foreign to the purposes of a wise Government, ought to be among its\r\nvery first and dearest objects.  When, therefore, the abettors of new\r\nsystem tell us, that between them and their opposers there is nothing but\r\na struggle for power, and that therefore we are no-ways concerned in it;\r\nwe must tell those who have the impudence to insult us in this manner,\r\nthat, of all things, we ought to be the most concerned, who and what sort\r\nof men they are, that hold the trust of everything that is dear to us.\r\nNothing can render this a point of indifference to the nation, but what\r\nmust either render us totally desperate, or soothe us into the security\r\nof idiots.  We must soften into a credulity below the milkiness of\r\ninfancy, to think all men virtuous.  We must be tainted with a malignity\r\ntruly diabolical, to believe all the world to be equally wicked and\r\ncorrupt.  Men are in public life as in private--some good, some evil.  The\r\nelevation of the one, and the depression of the other, are the first\r\nobjects of all true policy.  But that form of Government, which, neither\r\nin its direct institutions, nor in their immediate tendency, has\r\ncontrived to throw its affairs into the most trustworthy hands, but has\r\nleft its whole executory system to be disposed of agreeably to the\r\nuncontrolled pleasure of any one man, however excellent or virtuous, is a\r\nplan of polity defective not only in that member, but consequentially\r\nerroneous in every part of it.\r\n\r\nIn arbitrary Governments, the constitution of the Ministry follows the\r\nconstitution of the Legislature.  Both the Law and the Magistrate are the\r\ncreatures of Will.  It must be so.  Nothing, indeed, will appear more\r\ncertain, on any tolerable consideration of this matter, than that _every\r\nsort of Government ought to have its Administration correspondent to its\r\nLegislature_.  If it should be otherwise, things must fall into a hideous\r\ndisorder.  The people of a free Commonwealth, who have taken such care\r\nthat their laws should be the result of general consent, cannot be so\r\nsenseless as to suffer their executory system to be composed of persons\r\non whom they have no dependence, and whom no proofs of the public love\r\nand confidence have recommended to those powers, upon the use of which\r\nthe very being of the State depends.\r\n\r\nThe popular election of magistrates, and popular disposition of rewards\r\nand honours, is one of the first advantages of a free State.  Without it,\r\nor something equivalent to it, perhaps the people cannot long enjoy the\r\nsubstance of freedom; certainly none of the vivifying energy of good\r\nGovernment.  The frame of our Commonwealth did not admit of such an\r\nactual election: but it provided as well, and (while the spirit of the\r\nconstitution is preserved) better, for all the effects of it, than by the\r\nmethod of suffrage in any democratic State whatsoever.  It had always,\r\nuntil of late, been held the first duty of Parliament _to refuse to\r\nsupport Government_, _until power was in the hands of persons who were\r\nacceptable to the people_, _or while factions predominated in the Court\r\nin which the nation had no confidence_.  Thus all the good effects of\r\npopular election were supposed to be secured to us, without the mischiefs\r\nattending on perpetual intrigue, and a distinct canvass for every\r\nparticular office throughout the body of the people.  This was the most\r\nnoble and refined part of our constitution.  The people, by their\r\nrepresentatives and grandees, were intrusted with a deliberative power in\r\nmaking laws; the King with the control of his negative.  The King was\r\nintrusted with the deliberative choice and the election to office; the\r\npeople had the negative in a Parliamentary refusal to support.  Formerly\r\nthis power of control was what kept Ministers in awe of Parliaments, and\r\nParliaments in reverence with the people.  If the use of this power of\r\ncontrol on the system and persons of Administration is gone, everything\r\nis lost, Parliament and all.  We may assure ourselves, that if Parliament\r\nwill tamely see evil men take possession of all the strongholds of their\r\ncountry, and allow them time and means to fortify themselves, under a\r\npretence of giving them a fair trial, and upon a hope of discovering,\r\nwhether they will not be reformed by power, and whether their measures\r\nwill not be better than their morals; such a Parliament will give\r\ncountenance to their measures also, whatever that Parliament may pretend,\r\nand whatever those measures may be.\r\n\r\nEvery good political institution must have a preventive operation as well\r\nas a remedial.  It ought to have a natural tendency to exclude bad men\r\nfrom Government, and not to trust for the safety of the State to\r\nsubsequent punishment alone--punishment which has ever been tardy and\r\nuncertain, and which, when power is suffered in bad hands, may chance to\r\nfall rather on the injured than the criminal.\r\n\r\nBefore men are put forward into the great trusts of the State, they ought\r\nby their conduct to have obtained such a degree of estimation in their\r\ncountry as may be some sort of pledge and security to the public that\r\nthey will not abuse those trusts.  It is no mean security for a proper\r\nuse of power, that a man has shown by the general tenor of his actions,\r\nthat the affection, the good opinion, the confidence of his\r\nfellow-citizens have been among the principal objects of his life, and\r\nthat he has owed none of the gradations of his power or fortune to a\r\nsettled contempt or occasional forfeiture of their esteem.\r\n\r\nThat man who, before he comes into power, has no friends, or who, coming\r\ninto power, is obliged to desert his friends, or who, losing it, has no\r\nfriends to sympathise with him, he who has no sway among any part of the\r\nlanded or commercial interest, but whose whole importance has begun with\r\nhis office, and is sure to end with it, is a person who ought never to be\r\nsuffered by a controlling Parliament, to continue in any of those\r\nsituations which confer the lead and direction of all our public affairs;\r\nbecause such a man _has no connection with the sentiments and opinions of\r\nthe people_.\r\n\r\nThose knots or cabals of men who have got together, avowedly without any\r\npublic principle, in order to sell their conjunct iniquity at the higher\r\nrate, and are therefore universally odious, ought never to be suffered to\r\ndomineer in the State; because they have _no connection with the\r\nsentiments and opinions of the people_.\r\n\r\nThese are considerations which, in my opinion, enforce the necessity of\r\nhaving some better reason, in a free country and a free Parliament, for\r\nsupporting the Ministers of the Crown, than that short one, _That the\r\nKing has thought proper to appoint them_.  There is something very\r\ncourtly in this.  But it is a principle pregnant with all sorts of\r\nmischief, in a constitution like ours, to turn the views of active men\r\nfrom the country to the Court.  Whatever be the road to power, that is\r\nthe road which will be trod.  If the opinion of the country be of no use\r\nas a means of power or consideration, the qualities which usually procure\r\nthat opinion will be no longer cultivated.  And whether it will be right,\r\nin a State so popular in its constitution as ours, to leave ambition\r\nwithout popular motives, and to trust all to the operation of pure virtue\r\nin the minds of Kings and Ministers, and public men, must be submitted to\r\nthe judgment and good sense of the people of England.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nCunning men are here apt to break in, and, without directly controverting\r\nthe principle, to raise objections from the difficulty under which the\r\nSovereign labours to distinguish the genuine voice and sentiments of his\r\npeople from the clamour of a faction, by which it is so easily\r\ncounterfeited.  The nation, they say, is generally divided into parties,\r\nwith views and passions utterly irreconcilable.  If the King should put\r\nhis affairs into the hands of any one of them, he is sure to disgust the\r\nrest; if he select particular men from among them all, it is a hazard\r\nthat he disgusts them all.  Those who are left out, however divided\r\nbefore, will soon run into a body of opposition, which, being a\r\ncollection of many discontents into one focus, will without doubt be hot\r\nand violent enough.  Faction will make its cries resound through the\r\nnation, as if the whole were in an uproar, when by far the majority, and\r\nmuch the better part, will seem for awhile, as it were, annihilated by\r\nthe quiet in which their virtue and moderation incline them to enjoy the\r\nblessings of Government.  Besides that, the opinion of the mere vulgar is\r\na miserable rule even with regard to themselves, on account of their\r\nviolence and instability.  So that if you were to gratify them in their\r\nhumour to-day, that very gratification would be a ground of their\r\ndissatisfaction on the next.  Now as all these rules of public opinion\r\nare to be collected with great difficulty, and to be applied with equal\r\nuncertainty as to the effect, what better can a King of England do than\r\nto employ such men as he finds to have views and inclinations most\r\nconformable to his own, who are least infected with pride and self-will,\r\nand who are least moved by such popular humours as are perpetually\r\ntraversing his designs, and disturbing his service; trusting that when he\r\nmeans no ill to his people he will be supported in his appointments,\r\nwhether he chooses to keep or to change, as his private judgment or his\r\npleasure leads him?  He will find a sure resource in the real weight and\r\ninfluence of the Crown, when it is not suffered to become an instrument\r\nin the hands of a faction.\r\n\r\nI will not pretend to say that there is nothing at all in this mode of\r\nreasoning, because I will not assert that there is no difficulty in the\r\nart of government.  Undoubtedly the very best Administration must\r\nencounter a great deal of opposition, and the very worst will find more\r\nsupport than it deserves.  Sufficient appearances will never be wanting\r\nto those who have a mind to deceive themselves.  It is a fallacy in\r\nconstant use with those who would level all things, and confound right\r\nwith wrong, to insist upon the inconveniences which are attached to every\r\nchoice, without taking into consideration the different weight and\r\nconsequence of those inconveniences.  The question is not concerning\r\nabsolute discontent or perfect satisfaction in Government, neither of\r\nwhich can be pure and unmixed at any time or upon any system.  The\r\ncontroversy is about that degree of good-humour in the people, which may\r\npossibly be attained, and ought certainly to be looked for.  While some\r\npoliticians may be waiting to know whether the sense of every individual\r\nbe against them, accurately distinguishing the vulgar from the better\r\nsort, drawing lines between the enterprises of a faction and the efforts\r\nof a people, they may chance to see the Government, which they are so\r\nnicely weighing, and dividing, and distinguishing, tumble to the ground\r\nin the midst of their wise deliberation.  Prudent men, when so great an\r\nobject as the security of Government, or even its peace, is at stake,\r\nwill not run the risk of a decision which may be fatal to it.  They who\r\ncan read the political sky will seen a hurricane in a cloud no bigger\r\nthan a hand at the very edge of the horizon, and will run into the first\r\nharbour.  No lines can be laid down for civil or political wisdom.  They\r\nare a matter incapable of exact definition.  But, though no man can draw\r\na stroke between the confines of day and night, yet light and darkness\r\nare upon the whole tolerably distinguishable.  Nor will it be impossible\r\nfor a Prince to find out such a mode of government, and such persons to\r\nadminister it, as will give a great degree of content to his people,\r\nwithout any curious and anxious research for that abstract, universal,\r\nperfect harmony, which, while he is seeking, he abandons those means of\r\nordinary tranquillity which are in his power without any research at all.\r\n\r\nIt is not more the duty than it is the interest of a Prince to aim at\r\ngiving tranquillity to his Government.  If those who advise him may have\r\nan interest in disorder and confusion.  If the opinion of the people is\r\nagainst them, they will naturally wish that it should have no prevalence.\r\nHere it is that the people must on their part show themselves sensible of\r\ntheir own value.  Their whole importance, in the first instance, and\r\nafterwards their whole freedom, is at stake.  Their freedom cannot long\r\nsurvive their importance.  Here it is that the natural strength of the\r\nkingdom, the great peers, the leading landed gentlemen, the opulent\r\nmerchants and manufacturers, the substantial yeomanry, must interpose, to\r\nrescue their Prince, themselves, and their posterity.\r\n\r\nWe are at present at issue upon this point.  We are in the great crisis\r\nof this contention, and the part which men take, one way or other, will\r\nserve to discriminate their characters and their principles.  Until the\r\nmatter is decided, the country will remain in its present confusion.  For\r\nwhile a system of Administration is attempted, entirely repugnant to the\r\ngenius of the people, and not conformable to the plan of their\r\nGovernment, everything must necessarily be disordered for a time, until\r\nthis system destroys the constitution, or the constitution gets the\r\nbetter of this system.\r\n\r\nThere is, in my opinion, a peculiar venom and malignity in this political\r\ndistemper beyond any that I have heard or read of.  In former lines the\r\nprojectors of arbitrary Government attacked only the liberties of their\r\ncountry, a design surely mischievous enough to have satisfied a mind of\r\nthe most unruly ambition.  But a system unfavourable to freedom may be so\r\nformed as considerably to exalt the grandeur of the State, and men may\r\nfind in the pride and splendour of that prosperity some sort of\r\nconsolation for the loss of their solid privileges.  Indeed, the increase\r\nof the power of the State has often been urged by artful men, as a\r\npretext for some abridgment of the public liberty.  But the scheme of the\r\njunto under consideration not only strikes a palsy into every nerve of\r\nour free constitution, but in the same degree benumbs and stupefies the\r\nwhole executive power, rendering Government in all its grand operations\r\nlanguid, uncertain, ineffective, making Ministers fearful of attempting,\r\nand incapable of executing, any useful plan of domestic arrangement, or\r\nof foreign politics.  It tends to produce neither the security of a free\r\nGovernment, nor the energy of a Monarchy that is absolute.  Accordingly,\r\nthe Crown has dwindled away in proportion to the unnatural and turgid\r\ngrowth of this excrescence on the Court.\r\n\r\nThe interior Ministry are sensible that war is a situation which sets in\r\nits full light the value of the hearts of a people, and they well know\r\nthat the beginning of the importance of the people must be the end of\r\ntheirs.  For this reason they discover upon all occasions the utmost fear\r\nof everything which by possibility may lead to such an event.  I do not\r\nmean that they manifest any of that pious fear which is backward to\r\ncommit the safety of the country to the dubious experiment of war.  Such\r\na fear, being the tender sensation of virtue, excited, as it is\r\nregulated, by reason, frequently shows itself in a seasonable boldness,\r\nwhich keeps danger at a distance, by seeming to despise it.  Their fear\r\nbetrays to the first glance of the eye its true cause and its real\r\nobject.  Foreign powers, confident in the knowledge of their character,\r\nhave not scrupled to violate the most solemn treaties; and, in defiance\r\nof them, to make conquests in the midst of a general peace, and in the\r\nheart of Europe.  Such was the conquest of Corsica, by the professed\r\nenemies of the freedom of mankind, in defiance of those who were formerly\r\nits professed defenders.  We have had just claims upon the same\r\npowers--rights which ought to have been sacred to them as well as to us,\r\nas they had their origin in our lenity and generosity towards France and\r\nSpain in the day of their great humiliation.  Such I call the ransom of\r\nManilla, and the demand on France for the East India prisoners.  But\r\nthese powers put a just confidence in their resource of the double\r\nCabinet.  These demands (one of them, at least) are hastening fast\r\ntowards an acquittal by prescription.  Oblivion begins to spread her\r\ncobwebs over all our spirited remonstrances.  Some of the most valuable\r\nbranches of our trade are also on the point of perishing from the same\r\ncause.  I do not mean those branches which bear without the hand of the\r\nvine-dresser; I mean those which the policy of treaties had formerly\r\nsecured to us; I mean to mark and distinguish the trade of Portugal, the\r\nloss of which, and the power of the Cabal, have one and the same era.\r\n\r\nIf, by any chance, the Ministers who stand before the curtain possess or\r\naffect any spirit, it makes little or no impression.  Foreign Courts and\r\nMinisters, who were among the first to discover and to profit by this\r\ninvention of the _double Cabinet_, attended very little to their\r\nremonstrances.  They know that those shadows of Ministers have nothing to\r\ndo in the ultimate disposal of things.  Jealousies and animosities are\r\nsedulously nourished in the outward Administration, and have been even\r\nconsidered as a _causa sine qua non_ in its constitution: thence foreign\r\nCourts have a certainty, that nothing can be done by common counsel in\r\nthis nation.  If one of those Ministers officially takes up a business\r\nwith spirit, it serves only the better to signalise the meanness of the\r\nrest, and the discord of them all.  His colleagues in office are in haste\r\nto shake him off, and to disclaim the whole of his proceedings.  Of this\r\nnature was that astonishing transaction, in which Lord Rochford, our\r\nAmbassador at Paris, remonstrated against the attempt upon Corsica, in\r\nconsequence of a direct authority from Lord Shelburne.  This remonstrance\r\nthe French Minister treated with the contempt that was natural; as he was\r\nassured, from the Ambassador of his Court to ours, that these orders of\r\nLord Shelburne were not supported by the rest of the (I had like to have\r\nsaid British) Administration.  Lord Rochford, a man of spirit, could not\r\nendure this situation.  The consequences were, however, curious.  He\r\nreturns from Paris, and comes home full of anger.  Lord Shelburne, who\r\ngave the orders, is obliged to give up the seals.  Lord Rochford, who\r\nobeyed these orders, receives them.  He goes, however, into another\r\ndepartment of the same office, that he might not be obliged officially to\r\nacquiesce in one situation, under what he had officially remonstrated\r\nagainst in another.  At Paris, the Duke of Choiseul considered this\r\noffice arrangement as a compliment to him: here it was spoke of as an\r\nattention to the delicacy of Lord Rochford.  But whether the compliment\r\nwas to one or both, to this nation it was the same.  By this transaction\r\nthe condition of our Court lay exposed in all its nakedness.  Our office\r\ncorrespondence has lost all pretence to authenticity; British policy is\r\nbrought into derision in those nations, that a while ago trembled at the\r\npower of our arms, whilst they looked up with confidence to the equity,\r\nfirmness, and candour, which shone in all our negotiations.  I represent\r\nthis matter exactly in the light in which it has been universally\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nSuch has been the aspect of our foreign politics under the influence of a\r\n_double Cabinet_.  With such an arrangement at Court, it is impossible it\r\nshould have been otherwise.  Nor is it possible that this scheme should\r\nhave a better effect upon the government of our dependencies, the first,\r\nthe dearest, and most delicate objects of the interior policy of this\r\nempire.  The Colonies know that Administration is separated from the\r\nCourt, divided within itself, and detested by the nation.  The double\r\nCabinet has, in both the parts of it, shown the most malignant\r\ndispositions towards them, without being able to do them the smallest\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nThey are convinced, by sufficient experience, that no plan, either of\r\nlenity or rigour, can be pursued with uniformity and perseverance.\r\nTherefore they turn their eyes entirely from Great Britain, where they\r\nhave neither dependence on friendship nor apprehension from enmity.  They\r\nlook to themselves, and their own arrangements.  They grow every day into\r\nalienation from this country; and whilst they are becoming disconnected\r\nwith our Government, we have not the consolation to find that they are\r\neven friendly in their new independence.  Nothing can equal the futility,\r\nthe weakness, the rashness, the timidity, the perpetual contradiction, in\r\nthe management of our affairs in that part of the world.  A volume might\r\nbe written on this melancholy subject; but it were better to leave it\r\nentirely to the reflections of the reader himself, than not to treat it\r\nin the extent it deserves.\r\n\r\nIn what manner our domestic economy is affected by this system, it is\r\nneedless to explain.  It is the perpetual subject of their own\r\ncomplaints.\r\n\r\nThe Court party resolve the whole into faction.  Having said something\r\nbefore upon this subject, I shall only observe here, that, when they give\r\nthis account of the prevalence of faction, they present no very\r\nfavourable aspect of the confidence of the people in their own\r\nGovernment.  They may be assured, that however they amuse themselves with\r\na variety of projects for substituting something else in the place of\r\nthat great and only foundation of Government, the confidence of the\r\npeople, every attempt will but make their condition worse.  When men\r\nimagine that their food is only a cover for poison, and when they neither\r\nlove nor trust the hand that serves it, it is not the name of the roast\r\nbeef of Old England that will persuade them to sit down to the table that\r\nis spread for them.  When the people conceive that laws, and tribunals,\r\nand even popular assemblies, are perverted from the ends of their\r\ninstitution, they find in those names of degenerated establishments only\r\nnew motives to discontent.  Those bodies, which, when full of life and\r\nbeauty, lay in their arms and were their joy and comfort; when dead and\r\nputrid, become but the more loathsome from remembrance of former\r\nendearments.  A sullen gloom, and furious disorder, prevail by fits: the\r\nnation loses its relish for peace and prosperity, as it did in that\r\nseason of fulness which opened our troubles in the time of Charles the\r\nFirst.  A species of men to whom a state of order would become a sentence\r\nof obscurity, are nourished into a dangerous magnitude by the heat of\r\nintestine disturbances; and it is no wonder that, by a sort of sinister\r\npiety, they cherish, in their turn, the disorders which are the parents\r\nof all their consequence.  Superficial observers consider such persons as\r\nthe cause of the public uneasiness, when, in truth, they are nothing more\r\nthan the effect of it.  Good men look upon this distracted scene with\r\nsorrow and indignation.  Their hands are tied behind them.  They are\r\ndespoiled of all the power which might enable them to reconcile the\r\nstrength of Government with the rights of the people.  They stand in a\r\nmost distressing alternative.  But in the election among evils they hope\r\nbetter things from temporary confusion, than from established servitude.\r\nIn the mean time, the voice of law is not to be heard.  Fierce\r\nlicentiousness begets violent restraints.  The military arm is the sole\r\nreliance; and then, call your constitution what you please, it is the\r\nsword that governs.  The civil power, like every other that calls in the\r\naid of an ally stronger than itself, perishes by the assistance it\r\nreceives.  But the contrivers of this scheme of Government will not trust\r\nsolely to the military power, because they are cunning men.  Their\r\nrestless and crooked spirit drives them to rake in the dirt of every kind\r\nof expedient.  Unable to rule the multitude, they endeavour to raise\r\ndivisions amongst them.  One mob is hired to destroy another; a procedure\r\nwhich at once encourages the boldness of the populace, and justly\r\nincreases their discontent.  Men become pensioners of state on account of\r\ntheir abilities in the array of riot, and the discipline of confusion.\r\nGovernment is put under the disgraceful necessity of protecting from the\r\nseverity of the laws that very licentiousness, which the laws had been\r\nbefore violated to repress.  Everything partakes of the original\r\ndisorder.  Anarchy predominates without freedom, and servitude without\r\nsubmission or subordination.  These are the consequences inevitable to\r\nour public peace, from the scheme of rendering the executory Government\r\nat once odious and feeble; of freeing Administration from the\r\nconstitutional and salutary control of Parliament, and inventing for it a\r\nnew control, unknown to the constitution, an _interior_ Cabinet; which\r\nbrings the whole body of Government into confusion and contempt.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nAfter having stated, as shortly as I am able, the effects of this system\r\non our foreign affairs, on the policy of our Government with regard to\r\nour dependencies, and on the interior economy of the Commonwealth; there\r\nremains only, in this part of my design, to say something of the grand\r\nprinciple which first recommended this system at Court.  The pretence was\r\nto prevent the King from being enslaved by a faction, and made a prisoner\r\nin his closet.  This scheme might have been expected to answer at least\r\nits own end, and to indemnify the King, in his personal capacity, for all\r\nthe confusion into which it has thrown his Government.  But has it in\r\nreality answered this purpose?  I am sure, if it had, every affectionate\r\nsubject would have one motive for enduring with patience all the evils\r\nwhich attend it.\r\n\r\nIn order to come at the truth in this matter, it may not be amiss to\r\nconsider it somewhat in detail.  I speak here of the King, and not of the\r\nCrown; the interests of which we have already touched.  Independent of\r\nthat greatness which a King possesses merely by being a representative of\r\nthe national dignity, the things in which he may have an individual\r\ninterest seem to be these: wealth accumulated; wealth spent in\r\nmagnificence, pleasure, or beneficence; personal respect and attention;\r\nand above all, private ease and repose of mind.  These compose the\r\ninventory of prosperous circumstances, whether they regard a Prince or a\r\nsubject; their enjoyments differing only in the scale upon which they are\r\nformed.\r\n\r\nSuppose then we were to ask, whether the King has been richer than his\r\npredecessors in accumulated wealth, since the establishment of the plan\r\nof Favouritism?  I believe it will be found that the picture of royal\r\nindigence which our Court has presented until this year, has been truly\r\nhumiliating.  Nor has it been relieved from this unseemly distress, but\r\nby means which have hazarded the affection of the people, and shaken\r\ntheir confidence in Parliament.  If the public treasures had been\r\nexhausted in magnificence and splendour, this distress would have been\r\naccounted for, and in some measure justified.  Nothing would be more\r\nunworthy of this nation, than with a mean and mechanical rule, to mete\r\nout the splendour of the Crown.  Indeed, I have found very few persons\r\ndisposed to so ungenerous a procedure.  But the generality of people, it\r\nmust be confessed, do feel a good deal mortified, when they compare the\r\nwants of the Court with its expenses.  They do not behold the cause of\r\nthis distress in any part of the apparatus of Royal magnificence.  In all\r\nthis, they see nothing but the operations of parsimony, attended with all\r\nthe consequences of profusion.  Nothing expended, nothing saved.  Their\r\nwonder is increased by their knowledge, that besides the revenue settled\r\non his Majesty's Civil List to the amount of 800,000 pounds a year, he\r\nhas a farther aid, from a large pension list, near 90,000 pounds a year,\r\nin Ireland; from the produce of the Duchy of Lancaster (which we are told\r\nhas been greatly improved); from the revenue of the Duchy of Cornwall;\r\nfrom the American quit-rents; from the four and a half per cent. duty in\r\nthe Leeward Islands; this last worth to be sure considerably more than\r\n40,000 pounds a year.  The whole is certainly not much short of a million\r\nannually.\r\n\r\nThese are revenues within the knowledge and cognizance of our national\r\nCouncils.  We have no direct right to examine into the receipts from his\r\nMajesty's German Dominions, and the Bishopric of Osnaburg.  This is\r\nunquestionably true.  But that which is not within the province of\r\nParliament, is yet within the sphere of every man's own reflection.  If a\r\nforeign Prince resided amongst us, the state of his revenues could not\r\nfail of becoming the subject of our speculation.  Filled with an anxious\r\nconcern for whatever regards the welfare of our Sovereign, it is\r\nimpossible, in considering the miserable circumstances into which he has\r\nbeen brought, that this obvious topic should be entirely passed over.\r\nThere is an opinion universal, that these revenues produce something not\r\ninconsiderable, clear of all charges and establishments.  This produce\r\nthe people do not believe to be hoarded, nor perceive to be spent.  It is\r\naccounted for in the only manner it can, by supposing that it is drawn\r\naway, for the support of that Court faction, which, whilst it distresses\r\nthe nation, impoverishes the Prince in every one of his resources.  I\r\nonce more caution the reader, that I do not urge this consideration\r\nconcerning the foreign revenue, as if I supposed we had a direct right to\r\nexamine into the expenditure of any part of it; but solely for the\r\npurpose of showing how little this system of Favouritism has been\r\nadvantageous to the Monarch himself; which, without magnificence, has\r\nsunk him into a state of unnatural poverty; at the same time that he\r\npossessed every means of affluence, from ample revenues, both in this\r\ncountry and in other parts of his dominions.\r\n\r\nHas this system provided better for the treatment becoming his high and\r\nsacred character, and secured the King from those disgusts attached to\r\nthe necessity of employing men who are not personally agreeable?  This is\r\na topic upon which for many reasons I could wish to be silent; but the\r\npretence of securing against such causes of uneasiness, is the corner-\r\nstone of the Court party.  It has however so happened, that if I were to\r\nfix upon any one point, in which this system has been more particularly\r\nand shamefully blameable, the effects which it has produced would justify\r\nme in choosing for that point its tendency to degrade the personal\r\ndignity of the Sovereign, and to expose him to a thousand contradictions\r\nand mortifications.  It is but too evident in what manner these\r\nprojectors of Royal greatness have fulfilled all their magnificent\r\npromises.  Without recapitulating all the circumstances of the reign,\r\nevery one of which is more or less a melancholy proof of the truth of\r\nwhat I have advanced, let us consider the language of the Court but a few\r\nyears ago, concerning most of the persons now in the external\r\nAdministration: let me ask, whether any enemy to the personal feelings of\r\nthe Sovereign, could possibly contrive a keener instrument of\r\nmortification, and degradation of all dignity, than almost every part and\r\nmember of the present arrangement?  Nor, in the whole course of our\r\nhistory, has any compliance with the will of the people ever been known\r\nto extort from any Prince a greater contradiction to all his own declared\r\naffections and dislikes, than that which is now adopted, in direct\r\nopposition to every thing the people approve and desire.\r\n\r\nAn opinion prevails, that greatness has been more than once advised to\r\nsubmit to certain condescensions towards individuals, which have been\r\ndenied to the entreaties of a nation.  For the meanest and most dependent\r\ninstrument of this system knows, that there are hours when its existence\r\nmay depend upon his adherence to it; and he takes his advantage\r\naccordingly.  Indeed it is a law of nature, that whoever is necessary to\r\nwhat we have made our object, is sure, in some way, or in some time or\r\nother, to become our master.  All this however is submitted to, in order\r\nto avoid that monstrous evil of governing in concurrence with the opinion\r\nof the people.  For it seems to be laid down as a maxim, that a King has\r\nsome sort of interest in giving uneasiness to his subjects: that all who\r\nare pleasing to them, are to be of course disagreeable to him: that as\r\nsoon as the persons who are odious at Court are known to be odious to the\r\npeople, it is snatched at as a lucky occasion of showering down upon them\r\nall kinds of emoluments and honours.  None are considered as well-wishers\r\nto the Crown, but those who advised to some unpopular course of action;\r\nnone capable of serving it, but those who are obliged to call at every\r\ninstant upon all its power for the safety of their lives.  None are\r\nsupposed to be fit priests in the temple of Government, but the persons\r\nwho are compelled to fly into it for sanctuary.  Such is the effect of\r\nthis refined project; such is ever the result of all the contrivances\r\nwhich are used to free men from the servitude of their reason, and from\r\nthe necessity of ordering their affairs according to their evident\r\ninterests.  These contrivances oblige them to run into a real and ruinous\r\nservitude, in order to avoid a supposed restraint that might be attended\r\nwith advantage.\r\n\r\nIf therefore this system has so ill answered its own grand pretence of\r\nsaving the King from the necessity of employing persons disagreeable to\r\nhim, has it given more peace and tranquillity to his Majesty's private\r\nhours?  No, most certainly.  The father of his people cannot possibly\r\nenjoy repose, while his family is in such a state of distraction.  Then\r\nwhat has the Crown or the King profited by all this fine-wrought scheme?\r\nIs he more rich, or more splendid, or more powerful, or more at his ease,\r\nby so many labours and contrivances?  Have they not beggared his\r\nExchequer, tarnished the splendour of his Court, sunk his dignity, galled\r\nhis feelings, discomposed the whole order and happiness of his private\r\nlife?\r\n\r\nIt will be very hard, I believe, to state in what respect the King has\r\nprofited by that faction which presumptuously choose to call themselves\r\n_his friends_.\r\n\r\nIf particular men had grown into an attachment, by the distinguished\r\nhonour of the society of their Sovereign, and, by being the partakers of\r\nhis amusements, came sometimes to prefer the gratification of his\r\npersonal inclinations to the support of his high character, the thing\r\nwould be very natural, and it would be excusable enough.  But the\r\npleasant part of the story is, that these _King's friends_ have no more\r\nground for usurping such a title, than a resident freeholder in\r\nCumberland or in Cornwall.  They are only known to their Sovereign by\r\nkissing his hand, for the offices, pensions, and grants into which they\r\nhave deceived his benignity.  May no storm ever come, which will put the\r\nfirmness of their attachment to the proof; and which, in the midst of\r\nconfusions and terrors, and sufferings, may demonstrate the eternal\r\ndifference between a true and severe friend to the Monarchy, and a\r\nslippery sycophant of the Court; _Quantum infido scurrae distabit\r\namicus_!\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nSo far I have considered the effect of the Court system, chiefly as it\r\noperates upon the executive Government, on the temper of the people and\r\non the happiness of the Sovereign.  It remains that we should consider,\r\nwith a little attention, its operation upon Parliament.\r\n\r\nParliament was indeed the great object of all these politics, the end at\r\nwhich they aimed, as well as the instrument by which they were to\r\noperate.  But, before Parliament could be made subservient to a system,\r\nby which it was to be degraded from the dignity of a national council,\r\ninto a mere member of the Court, it must be greatly changed from its\r\noriginal character.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of this body, I have my eye chiefly on the House of Commons.\r\nI hope I shall be indulged in a few observations on the nature and\r\ncharacter of that assembly; not with regard to its _legal form and\r\npower_, but to its _spirit_, and to the purposes it is meant to answer in\r\nthe constitution.\r\n\r\nThe House of Commons was supposed originally to be _no part of the\r\nstanding Government of this country_.  It was considered as a control,\r\nissuing immediately from the people, and speedily to be resolved into the\r\nmass from whence it arose.  In this respect it was in the higher part of\r\nGovernment what juries are in the lower.  The capacity of a magistrate\r\nbeing transitory, and that of a citizen permanent, the latter capacity it\r\nwas hoped would of course preponderate in all discussions, not only\r\nbetween the people and the standing authority of the Crown, but between\r\nthe people and the fleeting authority of the House of Commons itself.  It\r\nwas hoped that, being of a middle nature between subject and Government,\r\nthey would feel with a more tender and a nearer interest everything that\r\nconcerned the people, than the other remoter and more permanent parts of\r\nLegislature.\r\n\r\nWhatever alterations time and the necessary accommodation of business may\r\nhave introduced, this character can never be sustained, unless the House\r\nof Commons shall be made to bear some stamp of the actual disposition of\r\nthe people at large.  It would (among public misfortunes) be an evil more\r\nnatural and tolerable, that the House of Commons should be infected with\r\nevery epidemical frenzy of the people, as this would indicate some\r\nconsanguinity, some sympathy of nature with their constituents, than that\r\nthey should in all cases be wholly untouched by the opinions and feelings\r\nof the people out of doors.  By this want of sympathy they would cease to\r\nbe a House of Commons.  For it is not the derivation of the power of that\r\nHouse from the people, which makes it in a distinct sense their\r\nrepresentative.  The King is the representative of the people; so are the\r\nLords; so are the Judges.  They all are trustees for the people, as well\r\nas the Commons; because no power is given for the sole sake of the\r\nholder; and although Government certainly is an institution of Divine\r\nauthority, yet its forms, and the persons who administer it, all\r\noriginate from the people.\r\n\r\nA popular origin cannot therefore be the characteristical distinction of\r\na popular representative.  This belongs equally to all parts of\r\nGovernment, and in all forms.  The virtue, spirit, and essence of a House\r\nof Commons consists in its being the express image of the feelings of the\r\nnation.  It was not instituted to be a control upon the people, as of\r\nlate it has been taught, by a doctrine of the most pernicious tendency.\r\nIt was designed as a control _for_ the people.  Other institutions have\r\nbeen formed for the purpose of checking popular excesses; and they are, I\r\napprehend, fully adequate to their object.  If not, they ought to be made\r\nso.  The House of Commons, as it was never intended for the support of\r\npeace and subordination, is miserably appointed for that service; having\r\nno stronger weapon than its Mace, and no better officer than its Serjeant-\r\nat-Arms, which it can command of its own proper authority.  A vigilant\r\nand jealous eye over executory and judicial magistracy; an anxious care\r\nof public money, an openness, approaching towards facility, to public\r\ncomplaint; these seem to be the true characteristics of a House of\r\nCommons.  But an addressing House of Commons, and a petitioning nation; a\r\nHouse of Commons full of confidence, when the nation is plunged in\r\ndespair; in the utmost harmony with Ministers, whom the people regard\r\nwith the utmost abhorrence; who vote thanks, when the public opinion\r\ncalls upon them for impeachments; who are eager to grant, when the\r\ngeneral voice demands account; who, in all disputes between the people\r\nand Administration, presume against the people; who punish their\r\ndisorder, but refuse even to inquire into the provocations to them; this\r\nis an unnatural, a monstrous state of things in this constitution.  Such\r\nan Assembly may be a great, wise, awful senate; but it is not, to any\r\npopular purpose, a House of Commons.  This change from an immediate state\r\nof procuration and delegation to a course of acting as from original\r\npower, is the way in which all the popular magistracies in the world have\r\nbeen perverted from their purposes.  It is indeed their greatest and\r\nsometimes their incurable corruption.  For there is a material\r\ndistinction between that corruption by which particular points are\r\ncarried against reason (this is a thing which cannot be prevented by\r\nhuman wisdom, and is of less consequence), and the corruption of the\r\nprinciple itself.  For then the evil is not accidental, but settled.  The\r\ndistemper becomes the natural habit.\r\n\r\nFor my part, I shall be compelled to conclude the principle of Parliament\r\nto be totally corrupted, and therefore its ends entirely defeated, when I\r\nsee two symptoms: first, a rule of indiscriminate support to all\r\nMinisters; because this destroys the very end of Parliament as a control,\r\nand is a general previous sanction to misgovernment; and secondly, the\r\nsetting up any claims adverse to the right of free election; for this\r\ntends to subvert the legal authority by which the House of Commons sits.\r\n\r\nI know that, since the Revolution, along with many dangerous, many useful\r\npowers of Government have been weakened.  It is absolutely necessary to\r\nhave frequent recourse to the Legislature.  Parliaments must therefore\r\nsit every year, and for great part of the year.  The dreadful disorders\r\nof frequent elections have also necessitated a septennial instead of a\r\ntriennial duration.  These circumstances, I mean the constant habit of\r\nauthority, and the infrequency of elections, have tended very much to\r\ndraw the House of Commons towards the character of a standing Senate.  It\r\nis a disorder which has arisen from the cure of greater disorders; it has\r\narisen from the extreme difficulty of reconciling liberty under a\r\nmonarchical Government, with external strength and with internal\r\ntranquillity.\r\n\r\nIt is very clear that we cannot free ourselves entirely from this great\r\ninconvenience; but I would not increase an evil, because I was not able\r\nto remove it; and because it was not in my power to keep the House of\r\nCommons religiously true to its first principles, I would not argue for\r\ncarrying it to a total oblivion of them.  This has been the great scheme\r\nof power in our time.  They who will not conform their conduct to the\r\npublic good, and cannot support it by the prerogative of the Crown, have\r\nadopted a new plan.  They have totally abandoned the shattered and old-\r\nfashioned fortress of prerogative, and made a lodgment in the stronghold\r\nof Parliament itself.  If they have any evil design to which there is no\r\nordinary legal power commensurate, they bring it into Parliament.  In\r\nParliament the whole is executed from the beginning to the end.  In\r\nParliament the power of obtaining their object is absolute, and the\r\nsafety in the proceeding perfect: no rules to confine, no after\r\nreckonings to terrify.  Parliament cannot with any great propriety punish\r\nothers for things in which they themselves have been accomplices.  Thus\r\nthe control of Parliament upon the executory power is lost; because\r\nParliament is made to partake in every considerable act of Government.\r\n_Impeachment_, _that great guardian of the purity of the Constitution_,\r\n_is in danger of being lost_, _even to the idea of it_.\r\n\r\nBy this plan several important ends are answered to the Cabal.  If the\r\nauthority of Parliament supports itself, the credit of every act of\r\nGovernment, which they contrive, is saved; but if the act be so very\r\nodious that the whole strength of Parliament is insufficient to recommend\r\nit, then Parliament is itself discredited; and this discredit increases\r\nmore and more that indifference to the constitution, which it is the\r\nconstant aim of its enemies, by their abuse of Parliamentary powers, to\r\nrender general among the people.  Whenever Parliament is persuaded to\r\nassume the offices of executive Government, it will lose all the\r\nconfidence, love, and veneration which it has ever enjoyed, whilst it was\r\nsupposed the _corrective_ and _control_ of the acting powers of the\r\nState.  This would be the event, though its conduct in such a perversion\r\nof its functions should be tolerably just and moderate; but if it should\r\nbe iniquitous, violent, full of passion, and full of faction, it would be\r\nconsidered as the most intolerable of all the modes of tyranny.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable time this separation of the representatives from their\r\nconstituents went on with a silent progress; and had those, who conducted\r\nthe plan for their total separation, been persons of temper and abilities\r\nany way equal to the magnitude of their design, the success would have\r\nbeen infallible; but by their precipitancy they have laid it open in all\r\nits nakedness; the nation is alarmed at it; and the event may not be\r\npleasant to the contrivers of the scheme.  In the last session, the corps\r\ncalled the _King's friends_ made a hardy attempt all at once, _to alter\r\nthe right of election itself_; to put it into the power of the House of\r\nCommons to disable any person disagreeable to them from sitting in\r\nParliament, without any other rule than their own pleasure; to make\r\nincapacities, either general for descriptions of men, or particular for\r\nindividuals; and to take into their body, persons who avowedly had never\r\nbeen chosen by the majority of legal electors, nor agreeably to any known\r\nrule of law.\r\n\r\nThe arguments upon which this claim was founded and combated, are not my\r\nbusiness here.  Never has a subject been more amply and more learnedly\r\nhandled, nor upon one side, in my opinion, more satisfactorily; they who\r\nare not convinced by what is already written would not receive conviction\r\n_though one arose from the dead_.\r\n\r\nI too have thought on this subject; but my purpose here, is only to\r\nconsider it as a part of the favourite project of Government; to observe\r\non the motives which led to it; and to trace its political consequences.\r\n\r\nA violent rage for the punishment of Mr. Wilkes was the pretence of the\r\nwhole.  This gentleman, by setting himself strongly in opposition to the\r\nCourt Cabal, had become at once an object of their persecution, and of\r\nthe popular favour.  The hatred of the Court party pursuing, and the\r\ncountenance of the people protecting him, it very soon became not at all\r\na question on the man, but a trial of strength between the two parties.\r\nThe advantage of the victory in this particular contest was the present,\r\nbut not the only, nor by any means, the principal, object.  Its operation\r\nupon the character of the House of Commons was the great point in view.\r\nThe point to be gained by the Cabal was this: that a precedent should be\r\nestablished, tending to show, _That the favour of the people was not so\r\nsure a road as the favour of the Court even to popular honours and\r\npopular trusts_.  A strenuous resistance to every appearance of lawless\r\npower; a spirit of independence carried to some degree of enthusiasm; an\r\ninquisitive character to discover, and a bold one to display, every\r\ncorruption and every error of Government; these are the qualities which\r\nrecommend a man to a seat in the House of Commons, in open and merely\r\npopular elections.  An indolent and submissive disposition; a disposition\r\nto think charitably of all the actions of men in power, and to live in a\r\nmutual intercourse of favours with them; an inclination rather to\r\ncountenance a strong use of authority, than to bear any sort of\r\nlicentiousness on the part of the people; these are unfavourable\r\nqualities in an open election for Members of Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe instinct which carries the people towards the choice of the former,\r\nis justified by reason; because a man of such a character, even in its\r\nexorbitancies, does not directly contradict the purposes of a trust, the\r\nend of which is a control on power.  The latter character, even when it\r\nis not in its extreme, will execute this trust but very imperfectly; and,\r\nif deviating to the least excess, will certainly frustrate instead of\r\nforwarding the purposes of a control on Government.  But when the House\r\nof Commons was to be new modelled, this principle was not only to be\r\nchanged, but reversed.  Whist any errors committed in support of power\r\nwere left to the law, with every advantage of favourable construction, of\r\nmitigation, and finally of pardon; all excesses on the side of liberty,\r\nor in pursuit of popular favour, or in defence of popular rights and\r\nprivileges, were not only to be punished by the rigour of the known law,\r\nbut by a _discretionary_ proceeding, which brought on _the loss of the\r\npopular object itself_.  Popularity was to be rendered, if not directly\r\npenal, at least highly dangerous.  The favour of the people might lead\r\neven to a disqualification of representing them.  Their odium might\r\nbecome, strained through the medium of two or three constructions, the\r\nmeans of sitting as the trustee of all that was dear to them.  This is\r\npunishing the offence in the offending part.  Until this time, the\r\nopinion of the people, through the power of an Assembly, still in some\r\nsort popular, led to the greatest honours and emoluments in the gift of\r\nthe Crown.  Now the principle is reversed; and the favour of the Court is\r\nthe only sure way of obtaining and holding those honours which ought to\r\nbe in the disposal of the people.\r\n\r\nIt signifies very little how this matter may be quibbled away.  Example,\r\nthe only argument of effect in civil life, demonstrates the truth of my\r\nproposition.  Nothing can alter my opinion concerning the pernicious\r\ntendency of this example, until I see some man for his indiscretion in\r\nthe support of power, for his violent and intemperate servility, rendered\r\nincapable of sitting in parliament.  For as it now stands, the fault of\r\noverstraining popular qualities, and, irregularly if you please,\r\nasserting popular privileges, has led to disqualification; the opposite\r\nfault never has produced the slightest punishment.  Resistance to power\r\nhas shut the door of the House of Commons to one man; obsequiousness and\r\nservility, to none.\r\n\r\nNot that I would encourage popular disorder, or any disorder.  But I\r\nwould leave such offences to the law, to be punished in measure and\r\nproportion.  The laws of this country are for the most part constituted,\r\nand wisely so, for the general ends of Government, rather than for the\r\npreservation of our particular liberties.  Whatever therefore is done in\r\nsupport of liberty, by persons not in public trust, or not acting merely\r\nin that trust, is liable to be more or less out of the ordinary course of\r\nthe law; and the law itself is sufficient to animadvert upon it with\r\ngreat severity.  Nothing indeed can hinder that severe letter from\r\ncrushing us, except the temperaments it may receive from a trial by jury.\r\nBut if the habit prevails of _going beyond the law_, and superseding this\r\njudicature, of carrying offences, real or supposed, into the legislative\r\nbodies, who shall establish themselves into _courts of criminal equity_,\r\n(so _the Star Chamber_ has been called by Lord Bacon,) all the evils of\r\nthe _Star_ Chamber are revived.  A large and liberal construction in\r\nascertaining offences, and a discretionary power in punishing them, is\r\nthe idea of criminal equity; which is in truth a monster in\r\nJurisprudence.  It signifies nothing whether a court for this purpose be\r\na Committee of Council, or a House of Commons, or a House of Lords; the\r\nliberty of the subject will be equally subverted by it.  The true end and\r\npurpose of that House of Parliament which entertains such a jurisdiction\r\nwill be destroyed by it.\r\n\r\nI will not believe, what no other man living believes, that Mr. Wilkes\r\nwas punished for the indecency of his publications, or the impiety of his\r\nransacked closet.  If he had fallen in a common slaughter of libellers\r\nand blasphemers, I could well believe that nothing more was meant than\r\nwas pretended.  But when I see, that, for years together, full as\r\nimpious, and perhaps more dangerous writings to religion, and virtue, and\r\norder, have not been punished, nor their authors discountenanced; that\r\nthe most audacious libels on Royal Majesty have passed without notice;\r\nthat the most treasonable invectives against the laws, liberties, and\r\nconstitution of the country, have not met with the slightest\r\nanimadversion; I must consider this as a shocking and shameless pretence.\r\nNever did an envenomed scurrility against everything sacred and civil,\r\npublic and private, rage through the kingdom with such a furious and\r\nunbridled licence.  All this while the peace of the nation must be\r\nshaken, to ruin one libeller, and to tear from the populace a single\r\nfavourite.\r\n\r\nNor is it that vice merely skulks in an obscure and contemptible\r\nimpunity.  Does not the public behold with indignation, persons not only\r\ngenerally scandalous in their lives, but the identical persons who, by\r\ntheir society, their instruction, their example, their encouragement,\r\nhave drawn this man into the very faults which have furnished the Cabal\r\nwith a pretence for his persecution, loaded with every kind of favour,\r\nhonour, and distinction, which a Court can bestow?  Add but the crime of\r\nservility (the _foedum crimem servitutis_) to every other crime, and the\r\nwhole mass is immediately transmuted into virtue, and becomes the just\r\nsubject of reward and honour.  When therefore I reflect upon this method\r\npursued by the Cabal in distributing rewards and punishments, I must\r\nconclude that Mr. Wilkes is the object of persecution, not on account of\r\nwhat he has done in common with others who are the objects of reward, but\r\nfor that in which he differs from many of them: that he is pursued for\r\nthe spirited dispositions which are blended with his vices; for his\r\nunconquerable firmness, for his resolute, indefatigable, strenuous\r\nresistance against oppression.\r\n\r\nIn this case, therefore, it was not the man that was to be punished, nor\r\nhis faults that were to be discountenanced.  Opposition to acts of power\r\nwas to be marked by a kind of civil proscription.  The popularity which\r\nshould arise from such an opposition was to be shown unable to protect\r\nit.  The qualities by which court is made to the people, were to render\r\nevery fault inexpiable, and every error irretrievable.  The qualities by\r\nwhich court is made to power, were to cover and to sanctify everything.\r\nHe that will have a sure and honourable seat, in the House of Commons,\r\nmust take care how he adventures to cultivate popular qualities;\r\notherwise he may, remember the old maxim, _Breves et infaustos populi\r\nRomani amores_.  If, therefore, a pursuit of popularity expose a man to\r\ngreater dangers than a disposition to servility, the principle which is\r\nthe life and soul of popular elections will perish out of the\r\nConstitution.\r\n\r\nIt behoves the people of England to consider how the House of Commons\r\nunder the operation of these examples must of necessity be constituted.\r\nOn the side of the Court will be, all honours, offices, emoluments; every\r\nsort of personal gratification to avarice or vanity; and, what is of more\r\nmoment to most gentlemen, the means of growing, by innumerable petty\r\nservices to individuals, into a spreading interest in their country.  On\r\nthe other hand, let us suppose a person unconnected with the Court, and\r\nin opposition to its system.  For his own person, no office, or\r\nemolument, or title; no promotion ecclesiastical, or civil, or military,\r\nor naval, for children, or brothers, or kindred.  In vain an expiring\r\ninterest in a borough calls for offices, or small livings, for the\r\nchildren of mayors, and aldermen, and capital burgesses.  His court rival\r\nhas them all.  He can do an infinite number of acts of generosity and\r\nkindness, and even of public spirit.  He can procure indemnity from\r\nquarters.  He can procure advantages in trade.  He can get pardons for\r\noffences.  He can obtain a thousand favours, and avert a thousand evils.\r\nHe may, while he betrays every valuable interest of the kingdom, be a\r\nbenefactor, a patron, a father, a guardian angel, to his borough.  The\r\nunfortunate independent member has nothing to offer, but harsh refusal,\r\nor pitiful excuse, or despondent representation of a hopeless interest.\r\nExcept from his private fortune, in which he may be equalled, perhaps\r\nexceeded, by his Court competitor, he has no way of showing any one good\r\nquality, or of making a single friend.  In the House, he votes for ever\r\nin a dispirited minority.  If he speaks, the doors are locked.  A body of\r\nloquacious placemen go out to tell the world, that all he aims at, is to\r\nget into office.  If he has not the talent of elocution, which is the\r\ncase of many as wise and knowing men as any in the House, he is liable to\r\nall these inconveniences, without the eclat which attends upon any\r\ntolerably successful exertion of eloquence.  Can we conceive a more\r\ndiscouraging post of duty than this?  Strip it of the poor reward of\r\npopularity; suffer even the excesses committed in defence of the popular\r\ninterest to become a ground for the majority of that House to form a\r\ndisqualification out of the line of the law, and at their pleasure,\r\nattended not only with the loss of the franchise, but with every kind of\r\npersonal disgrace; if this shall happen, the people of this kingdom may\r\nbe assured that they cannot be firmly or faithfully served by any man.  It\r\nis out of the nature of men and things that they should; and their\r\npresumption will be equal to their folly, if they expect it.  The power\r\nof the people, within the laws, must show itself sufficient to protect\r\nevery representative in the animated performance of his duty, or that\r\nduty cannot be performed.  The House of Commons can never be a control on\r\nother parts of Government, unless they are controlled themselves by their\r\nconstituents; and unless these constituents possess some right in the\r\nchoice of that House, which it is not in the power of that House to take\r\naway.  If they suffer this power of arbitrary incapacitation to stand,\r\nthey have utterly perverted every other power of the House of Commons.\r\nThe late proceeding, I will not say, _is_ contrary to law; it _must_ be\r\nso; for the power which is claimed cannot, by any possibility, be a legal\r\npower in any limited member of Government.\r\n\r\nThe power which they claim, of declaring incapacities, would not be above\r\nthe just claims of a final judicature, if they had not laid it down as a\r\nleading principle, that they had no rule in the exercise of this claim\r\nbut their own _discretion_.  Not one of their abettors has ever\r\nundertaken to assign the principle of unfitness, the species or degree of\r\ndelinquency, on which the House of Commons will expel, nor the mode of\r\nproceeding upon it, nor the evidence upon which it is established.  The\r\ndirect consequence of which is, that the first franchise of an\r\nEnglishman, and that on which all the rest vitally depend, is to be\r\nforfeited for some offence which no man knows, and which is to be proved\r\nby no known rule whatsoever of legal evidence.  This is so anomalous to\r\nour whole constitution, that I will venture to say, the most trivial\r\nright, which the subject claims, never was, nor can be, forfeited in such\r\na manner.\r\n\r\nThe whole of their usurpation is established upon this method of arguing.\r\nWe do not make laws.  No; we do not contend for this power.  We only\r\ndeclare law; and, as we are a tribunal both competent and supreme, what\r\nwe declare to be law becomes law, although it should not have been so\r\nbefore.  Thus the circumstance of having no appeal from their\r\njurisdiction is made to imply that they have no rule in the exercise of\r\nit: the judgment does not derive its validity from its conformity to the\r\nlaw; but preposterously the law is made to attend on the judgment; and\r\nthe rule of the judgment is no other than the _occasional will of the\r\nHouse_.  An arbitrary discretion leads, legality follows; which is just\r\nthe very nature and description of a legislative act.\r\n\r\nThis claim in their hands was no barren theory.  It was pursued into its\r\nutmost consequences; and a dangerous principle has begot a correspondent\r\npractice.  A systematic spirit has been shown upon both sides.  The\r\nelectors of Middlesex chose a person whom the House of Commons had voted\r\nincapable; and the House of Commons has taken in a member whom the\r\nelectors of Middlesex had not chosen.  By a construction on that\r\nlegislative power which had been assumed, they declared that the true\r\nlegal sense of the country was contained in the minority, on that\r\noccasion; and might, on a resistance to a vote of incapacity, be\r\ncontained in any minority.\r\n\r\nWhen any construction of law goes against the spirit of the privilege it\r\nwas meant to support, it is a vicious construction.  It is material to us\r\nto be represented really and bona fide, and not in forms, in types, and\r\nshadows, and fictions of law.  The right of election was not established\r\nmerely as a _matter of form_, to satisfy some method and rule of\r\ntechnical reasoning; it was not a principle which might substitute a\r\n_Titius_ or a _Maevius_, a _John Doe_ or _Richard Roe_, in the place of a\r\nman specially chosen; not a principle which was just as well satisfied\r\nwith one man as with another.  It is a right, the effect of which is to\r\ngive to the people that man, and that man only, whom by their voices,\r\nactually, not constructively given, they declare that they know, esteem,\r\nlove, and trust.  This right is a matter within their own power of\r\njudging and feeling; not an _ens rationis_ and creature of law: nor can\r\nthose devices, by which anything else is substituted in the place of such\r\nan actual choice, answer in the least degree the end of representation.\r\n\r\nI know that the courts of law have made as strained constructions in\r\nother cases.  Such is the construction in common recoveries.  The method\r\nof construction which in that case gives to the persons in remainder, for\r\ntheir security and representative, the door-keeper, crier, or sweeper of\r\nthe Court, or some other shadowy being without substance or effect, is a\r\nfiction of a very coarse texture.  This was however suffered, by the\r\nacquiescence of the whole kingdom, for ages; because the evasion of the\r\nold Statute of Westminster, which authorised perpetuities, had more sense\r\nand utility than the law which was evaded.  But an attempt to turn the\r\nright of election into such a farce and mockery as a fictitious fine and\r\nrecovery, will, I hope, have another fate; because the laws which give it\r\nare infinitely dear to us, and the evasion is infinitely contemptible.\r\n\r\nThe people indeed have been told, that this power of discretionary\r\ndisqualification is vested in hands that they may trust, and who will be\r\nsure not to abuse it to their prejudice.  Until I find something in this\r\nargument differing from that on which every mode of despotism has been\r\ndefended, I shall not be inclined to pay it any great compliment.  The\r\npeople are satisfied to trust themselves with the exercise of their own\r\nprivileges, and do not desire this kind intervention of the House of\r\nCommons to free them from the burthen.  They are certainly in the right.\r\nThey ought not to trust the House of Commons with a power over their\r\nfranchises; because the constitution, which placed two other co-ordinate\r\npowers to control it, reposed no such confidence in that body.  It were a\r\nfolly well deserving servitude for its punishment, to be full of\r\nconfidence where the laws are full of distrust; and to give to an House\r\nof Commons, arrogating to its sole resolution the most harsh and odious\r\npart of legislative authority, that degree of submission which is due\r\nonly to the Legislature itself.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Commons, in an endeavour to obtain new advantages at\r\nthe expense of the other orders of the State, for the benefits of the\r\n_Commons at large_, have pursued strong measures; if it were not just, it\r\nwas at least natural, that the constituents should connive at all their\r\nproceedings; because we were ourselves ultimately to profit.  But when\r\nthis submission is urged to us, in a contest between the representatives\r\nand ourselves, and where nothing can be put into their scale which is not\r\ntaken from ours, they fancy us to be children when they tell us they are\r\nour representatives, our own flesh and blood, and that all the stripes\r\nthey give us are for our good.  The very desire of that body to have such\r\na trust contrary to law reposed in them, shows that they are not worthy\r\nof it.  They certainly will abuse it; because all men possessed of an\r\nuncontrolled discretionary power leading to the aggrandisement and profit\r\nof their own body have always abused it: and I see no particular sanctity\r\nin our times, that is at all likely, by a miraculous operation, to\r\noverrule the course of nature.\r\n\r\nBut we must purposely shut our eyes, if we consider this matter merely as\r\na contest between the House of Commons and the Electors.  The true\r\ncontest is between the Electors of the Kingdom and the Crown; the Crown\r\nacting by an instrumental House of Commons.  It is precisely the same,\r\nwhether the Ministers of the Crown can disqualify by a dependent House of\r\nCommons, or by a dependent court of _Star Chamber_, or by a dependent\r\ncourt of King's Bench.  If once Members of Parliament can be practically\r\nconvinced that they do not depend on the affection or opinion of the\r\npeople for their political being, they will give themselves over, without\r\neven an appearance of reserve, to the influence of the Court.\r\n\r\nIndeed, a Parliament unconnected with the people, is essential to a\r\nMinistry unconnected with the people; and therefore those who saw through\r\nwhat mighty difficulties the interior Ministry waded, and the exterior\r\nwere dragged, in this business, will conceive of what prodigious\r\nimportance, the new corps of _King's men_ held this principle of\r\noccasional and personal incapacitation, to the whole body of their\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nWhen the House of Commons was thus made to consider itself as the master\r\nof its constituents, there wanted but one thing to secure that House\r\nagainst all possible future deviation towards popularity; an unlimited\r\nfund of money to be laid out according to the pleasure of the Court.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nTo complete the scheme of bringing our Court to a resemblance to the\r\nneighbouring Monarchies, it was necessary, in effect, to destroy those\r\nappropriations of revenue, which seem to limit the property, as the other\r\nlaws had done the powers, of the Crown.  An opportunity for this purpose\r\nwas taken, upon an application to Parliament for payment of the debts of\r\nthe Civil List; which in 1769 had amounted to 513,000 pounds.  Such\r\napplication had been made upon former occasions; but to do it in the\r\nformer manner would by no means answer the present purpose.\r\n\r\nWhenever the Crown had come to the Commons to desire a supply for the\r\ndischarging of debts due on the Civil List, it was always asked and\r\ngranted with one of the three following qualifications; sometimes with\r\nall of them.  Either it was stated that the revenue had been diverted\r\nfrom its purposes by Parliament; or that those duties had fallen short of\r\nthe sum for which they were given by Parliament, and that the intention\r\nof the Legislature had not been fulfilled; or that the money required to\r\ndischarge the Civil List debt was to be raised chargeable on the Civil\r\nList duties.  In the reign of Queen Anne, the Crown was found in debt.\r\nThe lessening and granting away some part of her revenue by Parliament\r\nwas alleged as the cause of that debt, and pleaded as an equitable ground\r\n(such it certainly was), for discharging it.  It does not appear that the\r\nduties which wore then applied to the ordinary Government produced clear\r\nabove 580,000 pounds a year; because, when they were afterwards granted\r\nto George the First, 120,000 pounds was added, to complete the whole to\r\n700,000 pounds a year.  Indeed it was then asserted, and, I have no\r\ndoubt, truly, that for many years the nett produce did not amount to\r\nabove 550,000 pounds.  The Queen's extraordinary charges were besides\r\nvery considerable; equal, at least, to any we have known in our time.  The\r\napplication to Parliament was not for an absolute grant of money, but to\r\nempower the Queen to raise it by borrowing upon the Civil List funds.\r\n\r\nThe Civil List debt was twice paid in the reign of George the First.  The\r\nmoney was granted upon the same plan which had been followed in the reign\r\nof Queen Anne.  The Civil List revenues were then mortgaged for the sum\r\nto be raised, and stood charged with the ransom of their own deliverance.\r\n\r\nGeorge the Second received an addition to his Civil List.  Duties were\r\ngranted for the purpose of raising 800,000 pounds a year.  It was not\r\nuntil he had reigned nineteen years, and after the last rebellion, that\r\nhe called upon Parliament for a discharge of the Civil List debt.  The\r\nextraordinary charges brought on by the rebellion, account fully for the\r\nnecessities of the Crown.  However, the extraordinary charges of\r\nGovernment were not thought a ground fit to be relied on.  A deficiency\r\nof the Civil List duties for several years before was stated as the\r\nprincipal, if not the sole, ground on which an application to Parliament\r\ncould be justified.  About this time the produce of these duties had\r\nfallen pretty low; and even upon an average of the whole reign they never\r\nproduced 800,000 pounds a year clear to the Treasury.\r\n\r\nThat Prince reigned fourteen years afterwards: not only no new demands\r\nwere made, but with so much good order were his revenues and expenses\r\nregulated, that, although many parts of the establishment of the Court\r\nwere upon a larger and more liberal scale than they have been since,\r\nthere was a considerable sum in hand, on his decease, amounting to about\r\n170,000 pounds, applicable to the service of the Civil List of his\r\npresent Majesty.  So that, if this reign commenced with a greater charge\r\nthan usual, there was enough, and more than enough, abundantly to supply\r\nall the extraordinary expense.  That the Civil List should have been\r\nexceeded in the two former reigns, especially in the reign of George the\r\nFirst, was not at all surprising.  His revenue was but 700,000 pounds\r\nannually; if it ever produced so much clear.  The prodigious and\r\ndangerous disaffection to the very being of the establishment, and the\r\ncause of a Pretender then powerfully abetted from abroad, produced many\r\ndemands of an extraordinary nature both abroad and at home.  Much\r\nmanagement and great expenses were necessary.  But the throne of no\r\nPrince has stood upon more unshaken foundations than that of his present\r\nMajesty.\r\n\r\nTo have exceeded the sum given for the Civil List, and to have incurred a\r\ndebt without special authority of Parliament, was, _prima facie_, a\r\ncriminal act: as such Ministers ought naturally rather to have withdrawn\r\nit from the inspection, than to have exposed it to the scrutiny, of\r\nParliament.  Certainly they ought, of themselves, officially to have come\r\narmed with every sort of argument, which, by explaining, could excuse a\r\nmatter in itself of presumptive guilt.  But the terrors of the House of\r\nCommons are no longer for Ministers.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the peculiar character of the House of Commons, as\r\ntrustee of the public purse, would have led them to call with a\r\npunctilious solicitude for every public account, and to have examined\r\ninto them with the most rigorous accuracy.\r\n\r\nThe capital use of an account is, that the reality of the charge, the\r\nreason of incurring it, and the justice and necessity of discharging it,\r\nshould all appear antecedent to the payment.  No man ever pays first, and\r\ncalls for his account afterwards; because he would thereby let out of his\r\nhands the principal, and indeed only effectual, means of compelling a\r\nfull and fair one.  But, in national business, there is an additional\r\nreason for a previous production of every account.  It is a cheek,\r\nperhaps the only one, upon a corrupt and prodigal use of public money.  An\r\naccount after payment is to no rational purpose an account.  However, the\r\nHouse of Commons thought all these to be antiquated principles; they were\r\nof opinion that the most Parliamentary way of proceeding was, to pay\r\nfirst what the Court thought proper to demand, and to take its chance for\r\nan examination into accounts at some time of greater leisure.\r\n\r\nThe nation had settled 800,000 pounds a year on the Crown, as sufficient\r\nfor the purpose of its dignity, upon the estimate of its own Ministers.\r\nWhen Ministers came to Parliament, and said that this allowance had not\r\nbeen sufficient for the purpose, and that they had incurred a debt of\r\n500,000 pounds, would it not have been natural for Parliament first to\r\nhave asked, how, and by what means, their appropriated allowance came to\r\nbe insufficient?  Would it not have savoured of some attention to\r\njustice, to have seen in what periods of Administration this debt had\r\nbeen originally incurred; that they might discover, and if need were,\r\nanimadvert on the persons who were found the most culpable?  To put their\r\nhands upon such articles of expenditure as they thought improper or\r\nexcessive, and to secure, in future, against such misapplication or\r\nexceeding?  Accounts for any other purposes are but a matter of\r\ncuriosity, and no genuine Parliamentary object.  All the accounts which\r\ncould answer any Parliamentary end were refused, or postponed by previous\r\nquestions.  Every idea of prevention was rejected, as conveying an\r\nimproper suspicion of the Ministers of the Crown.\r\n\r\nWhen every leading account had been refused, many others were granted\r\nwith sufficient facility.\r\n\r\nBut with great candour also, the House was informed, that hardly any of\r\nthem could be ready until the next session; some of them perhaps not so\r\nsoon.  But, in order firmly to establish the precedent of _payment\r\nprevious to account_, and to form it into a settled rule of the House,\r\nthe god in the machine was brought down, nothing less than the wonder-\r\nworking _Law of Parliament_.  It was alleged, that it is the law of\r\nParliament, when any demand comes from the Crown, that the House must go\r\nimmediately into the Committee of Supply; in which Committee it was\r\nallowed, that the production and examination of accounts would be quite\r\nproper and regular.  It was therefore carried that they should go into\r\nthe Committee without delay, and without accounts, in order to examine\r\nwith great order and regularity things that could not possibly come\r\nbefore them.  After this stroke of orderly and Parliamentary wit and\r\nhumour, they went into the Committee, and very generously voted the\r\npayment.\r\n\r\nThere was a circumstance in that debate too remarkable to be overlooked.\r\nThis debt of the Civil List was all along argued upon the same footing as\r\na debt of the State, contracted upon national authority.  Its payment was\r\nurged as equally pressing upon the public faith and honour; and when the\r\nwhole year's account was stated, in what is called _The Budget_, the\r\nMinistry valued themselves on the payment of so much public debt, just as\r\nif they had discharged 500,000 pounds of navy or exchequer bills.  Though,\r\nin truth, their payment, from the Sinking Fund, of debt which was never\r\ncontracted by Parliamentary authority, was, to all intents and purposes,\r\nso much debt incurred.  But such is the present notion of public credit\r\nand payment of debt.  No wonder that it produces such effects.\r\n\r\nNor was the House at all more attentive to a provident security against\r\nfuture, than it had been to a vindictive retrospect to past,\r\nmismanagements.  I should have thought indeed that a Ministerial promise,\r\nduring their own continuance in office, might have been given, though\r\nthis would have been but a poor security for the public.  Mr. Pelham gave\r\nsuch an assurance, and he kept his word.  But nothing was capable of\r\nextorting from our Ministers anything which had the least resemblance to\r\na promise of confining the expenses of the Civil List within the limits\r\nwhich had been settled by Parliament.  This reserve of theirs I look upon\r\nto be equivalent to the clearest declaration that they were resolved upon\r\na contrary course.\r\n\r\nHowever, to put the matter beyond all doubt, in the Speech from the\r\nThrone, after thanking Parliament for the relief so liberally granted,\r\nthe Ministers inform the two Houses that they will _endeavour_ to confine\r\nthe expenses of the Civil Government--within what limits, think you?\r\nthose which the law had prescribed?  Not in the least--\"such limits as\r\nthe _honour of the Crown_ can possibly admit.\"\r\n\r\nThus they established an arbitrary standard for that dignity which\r\nParliament had defined and limited to a legal standard.  They gave\r\nthemselves, under the lax and indeterminate idea of the _honour of the\r\nCrown_, a full loose for all manner of dissipation, and all manner of\r\ncorruption.  This arbitrary standard they were not afraid to hold out to\r\nboth Houses; while an idle and inoperative Act of Parliament, estimating\r\nthe dignity of the Crown at 800,000 pounds, and confining it to that sum,\r\nadds to the number of obsolete statutes which load the shelves of\r\nlibraries without any sort of advantage to the people.\r\n\r\nAfter this proceeding, I suppose that no man can be so weak as to think\r\nthat the Crown is limited to any settled allowance whatsoever.  For if\r\nthe Ministry has 800,000 pounds a year by the law of the land, and if by\r\nthe law of Parliament all the debts which exceed it are to be paid\r\nprevious to the production of any account, I presume that this is\r\nequivalent to an income with no other limits than the abilities of the\r\nsubject and the moderation of the Court--that is to say, it is such in\r\nincome as is possessed by every absolute Monarch in Europe.  It amounts,\r\nas a person of great ability said in the debate, to an unlimited power of\r\ndrawing upon the Sinking Fund.  Its effect on the public credit of this\r\nkingdom must be obvious; for in vain is the Sinking Fund the great\r\nbuttress of all the rest, if it be in the power of the Ministry to resort\r\nto it for the payment of any debts which they may choose to incur, under\r\nthe name of the Civil List, and through the medium of a committee, which\r\nthinks itself obliged by law to vote supplies without any other account\r\nthan that of the more existence of the debt.\r\n\r\nFive hundred thousand pounds is a serious sum.  But it is nothing to the\r\nprolific principle upon which the sum was voted--a principle that may be\r\nwell called, _the fruitful mother of a hundred more_.  Neither is the\r\ndamage to public credit of very great consequence when compared with that\r\nwhich results to public morals and to the safety of the Constitution,\r\nfrom the exhaustless mine of corruption opened by the precedent, and to\r\nbe wrought by the principle of the late payment of the debts of the Civil\r\nList.  The power of discretionary disqualification by one law of\r\nParliament, and the necessity of paying every debt of the Civil List by\r\nanother law of Parliament, if suffered to pass unnoticed, must establish\r\nsuch a fund of rewards and terrors as will make Parliament the best\r\nappendage and support of arbitrary power that ever was invented by the\r\nwit of man.  This is felt.  The quarrel is begun between the\r\nRepresentatives and the People.  The Court Faction have at length\r\ncommitted them.\r\n\r\nIn such a strait the wisest may well be perplexed, and the boldest\r\nstaggered.  The circumstances are in a great measure new.  We have hardly\r\nany landmarks from the wisdom of our ancestors to guide us.  At best we\r\ncan only follow the spirit of their proceeding in other cases.  I know\r\nthe diligence with which my observations on our public disorders have\r\nbeen made.  I am very sure of the integrity of the motives on which they\r\nare published: I cannot be equally confident in any plan for the absolute\r\ncure of those disorders, or for their certain future prevention.  My aim\r\nis to bring this matter into more public discussion.  Let the sagacity of\r\nothers work upon it.  It is not uncommon for medical writers to describe\r\nhistories of diseases, very accurately, on whose cure they can say but\r\nvery little.\r\n\r\nThe first ideas which generally suggest themselves for the cure of\r\nParliamentary disorders are, to shorten the duration of Parliaments, and\r\nto disqualify all, or a great number of placemen, from a seat in the\r\nHouse of Commons.  Whatever efficacy there may be in those remedies, I am\r\nsure in the present state of things it is impossible to apply them.  A\r\nrestoration of the right of free election is a preliminary indispensable\r\nto every other reformation.  What alterations ought afterwards to be made\r\nin the constitution is a matter of deep and difficult research.\r\n\r\nIf I wrote merely to please the popular palate, it would indeed be as\r\nlittle troublesome to me as to another to extol these remedies, so famous\r\nin speculation, but to which their greatest admirers have never attempted\r\nseriously to resort in practice.  I confess them, that I have no sort of\r\nreliance upon either a Triennial Parliament or a Place-bill.  With regard\r\nto the former, perhaps, it might rather serve to counteract than to\r\npromote the ends that are proposed by it.  To say nothing of the horrible\r\ndisorders among the people attending frequent elections, I should be\r\nfearful of committing, every three years, the independent gentlemen of\r\nthe country into a contest with the Treasury.  It is easy to see which of\r\nthe contending parties would be ruined first.  Whoever has taken a\r\ncareful view of public proceedings, so as to endeavour to ground his\r\nspeculations on his experience, must have observed how prodigiously\r\ngreater the power of Ministry is in the first and last session of a\r\nParliament, than it is in the intermediate periods, when Members sit a\r\nlittle on their seats.  The persons of the greatest Parliamentary\r\nexperience, with whom I have conversed, did constantly, in canvassing the\r\nfate of questions, allow something to the Court side, upon account of the\r\nelections depending or imminent.  The evil complained of, if it exists in\r\nthe present state of things, would hardly be removed by a triennial\r\nParliament: for, unless the influence of Government in elections can be\r\nentirely taken away, the more frequently they return, the more they will\r\nharass private independence; the more generally men will be compelled to\r\nfly to the settled systematic interest of Government, and to the\r\nresources of a boundless Civil List.  Certainly something may be done,\r\nand ought to be done, towards lessening that influence in elections; and\r\nthis will be necessary upon a plan either of longer or shorter duration\r\nof Parliament.  But nothing can so perfectly remove the evil, as not to\r\nrender such contentions, foot frequently repeated, utterly ruinous, first\r\nto independence of fortune, and then to independence of spirit.  As I am\r\nonly giving an opinion on this point, and not at all debating it in an\r\nadverse line, I hope I may be excused in another observation.  With great\r\ntruth I may aver that I never remember to have talked on this subject\r\nwith any man much conversant with public business who considered short\r\nParliaments as a real improvement of the Constitution.  Gentlemen, warm\r\nin a popular cause, are ready enough to attribute all the declarations of\r\nsuch persons to corrupt motives.  But the habit of affairs, if, on one\r\nhand, it tends to corrupt the mind, furnishes it, on the other, with the,\r\nmeans of better information.  The authority of such persons will always\r\nhave some weight.  It may stand upon a par with the speculations of those\r\nwho are less practised in business; and who, with perhaps purer\r\nintentions, have not so effectual means of judging.  It is besides an\r\neffect of vulgar and puerile malignity to imagine that every Statesman is\r\nof course corrupt: and that his opinion, upon every constitutional point,\r\nis solely formed upon some sinister interest.\r\n\r\nThe next favourite remedy is a Place-bill.  The same principle guides in\r\nboth: I mean the opinion which is entertained by many of the\r\ninfallibility of laws and regulations, in the cure of public distempers.\r\nWithout being as unreasonably doubtful as many are unwisely confident, I\r\nwill only say, that this also is a matter very well worthy of serious and\r\nmature reflection.  It is not easy to foresee what the effect would be of\r\ndisconnecting with Parliament, the greatest part of those who hold civil\r\nemployments, and of such mighty and important bodies as the military and\r\nnaval establishments.  It were better, perhaps, that they should have a\r\ncorrupt interest in the forms of the constitution, than they should have\r\nnone at all.  This is a question altogether different from the\r\ndisqualification of a particular description of Revenue Officers from\r\nseats in Parliament; or, perhaps, of all the lower sorts of them from\r\nvotes in elections.  In the former case, only the few are affected; in\r\nthe latter, only the inconsiderable.  But a great official, a great\r\nprofessional, a great military and naval interest, all necessarily\r\ncomprehending many people of the first weight, ability, wealth, and\r\nspirit, has been gradually formed in the kingdom.  These new interests\r\nmust be let into a share of representation, else possibly they may be\r\ninclined to destroy those institutions of which they are not permitted to\r\npartake.  This is not a thing to be trifled with: nor is it every well-\r\nmeaning man that is fit to put his hands to it.  Many other serious\r\nconsiderations occur.  I do not open them here, because they are not\r\ndirectly to my purpose; proposing only to give the reader some taste of\r\nthe difficulties that attend all capital changes in the Constitution;\r\njust to hint the uncertainty, to say no worse, of being able to prevent\r\nthe Court, as long as it has the means of influence abundantly in its\r\npower, from applying that influence to Parliament; and perhaps, if the\r\npublic method were precluded, of doing it in some worse and more\r\ndangerous method.  Underhand and oblique ways would be studied.  The\r\nscience of evasion, already tolerably understood, would then be brought\r\nto the greatest perfection.  It is no inconsiderable part of wisdom, to\r\nknow how much of an evil ought to be tolerated; lest, by attempting a\r\ndegree of purity impracticable in degenerate times and manners, instead\r\nof cutting off the subsisting ill practices, new corruptions might be\r\nproduced for the concealment and security of the old.  It were better,\r\nundoubtedly, that no influence at all could affect the mind of a Member\r\nof Parliament.  But of all modes of influence, in my opinion, a place\r\nunder the Government is the least disgraceful to the man who holds it,\r\nand by far the most safe to the country.  I would not shut out that sort\r\nof influence which is open and visible, which is connected with the\r\ndignity and the service of the State, when it is not in my power to\r\nprevent the influence of contracts, of subscriptions, of direct bribery,\r\nand those innumerable methods of clandestine corruption, which are\r\nabundantly in the hands of the Court, and which will be applied as long\r\nas these means of corruption, and the disposition to be corrupted, have\r\nexistence amongst us.  Our Constitution stands on a nice equipoise, with\r\nsteep precipices and deep waters upon all sides of it.  In removing it\r\nfrom a dangerous leaning towards one side, there may be a risk of\r\noversetting it on the other.  Every project of a material change in a\r\nGovernment so complicated as ours, combined at the same time with\r\nexternal circumstances still more complicated, is a matter full of\r\ndifficulties; in which a considerate man will not be too ready to decide;\r\na prudent man too ready to undertake; or an honest man too ready to\r\npromise.  They do not respect the public nor themselves, who engage for\r\nmore than they are sure that they ought to attempt, or that they are able\r\nto perform.  These are my sentiments, weak perhaps, but honest and\r\nunbiassed; and submitted entirely to the opinion of grave men, well\r\naffected to the constitution of their country, and of experience in what\r\nmay best promote or hurt it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, in the situation in which we stand, with an immense revenue, an\r\nenormous debt, mighty establishments, Government itself a great banker\r\nand a great merchant, I see no other way for the preservation of a decent\r\nattention to public interest in the Representatives, but _the\r\ninterposition of the body of the people itself_, whenever it shall\r\nappear, by some flagrant and notorious act, by some capital innovation,\r\nthat these Representatives are going to over-leap the fences of the law,\r\nand to introduce an arbitrary power.  This interposition is a most\r\nunpleasant remedy.  But, if it be a legal remedy, it is intended on some\r\noccasion to be used; to be used then only, when it is evident that\r\nnothing else can hold the Constitution to its true principles.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nThe distempers of Monarchy were the great subjects of apprehension and\r\nredress, in the last century; in this, the distempers of Parliament.  It\r\nis not in Parliament alone that the remedy for Parliamentary disorders\r\ncan be completed; hardly, indeed, can it begin there.  Until a confidence\r\nin Government is re-established, the people ought to be excited to a more\r\nstrict and detailed attention to the conduct of their Representatives.\r\nStandards, for judging more systematically upon their conduct, ought to\r\nbe settled in the meetings of counties and corporations.  Frequent and\r\ncorrect lists of the voters in all important questions ought to be\r\nprocured.\r\n\r\nBy such means something may be done.  By such means it may appear who\r\nthose are, that, by an indiscriminate support of all Administrations,\r\nhave totally banished all integrity and confidence out of public\r\nproceedings; have confounded the best men with the worst; and weakened\r\nand dissolved, instead of strengthening and compacting, the general frame\r\nof Government.  If any person is more concerned for government and order\r\nthan for the liberties of his country, even he is equally concerned to\r\nput an end to this course of indiscriminate support.  It is this blind\r\nand undistinguishing support that feeds the spring of those very\r\ndisorders, by which he is frighted into the arms of the faction which\r\ncontains in itself the source of all disorders, by enfeebling all the\r\nvisible and regular authority of the State.  The distemper is increased\r\nby his injudicious and preposterous endeavours, or pretences, for the\r\ncure of it.\r\n\r\nAn exterior Administration, chosen for its impotency, or after it is\r\nchosen purposely rendered impotent, in order to be rendered subservient,\r\nwill not be obeyed.  The laws themselves will not be respected, when\r\nthose who execute them are despised: and they will be despised, when\r\ntheir power is not immediate from the Crown, or natural in the kingdom.\r\nNever were Ministers better supported in Parliament.  Parliamentary\r\nsupport comes and goes with office, totally regardless of the man, or the\r\nmerit.  Is Government strengthened?  It grows weaker and weaker.  The\r\npopular torrent gains upon it every hour.  Let us learn from our\r\nexperience.  It is not support that is wanting to Government, but\r\nreformation.  When Ministry rests upon public opinion, it is not indeed\r\nbuilt upon a rock of adamant; it has, however, some stability.  But when\r\nit stands upon private humour, its structure is of stubble, and its\r\nfoundation is on quicksand.  I repeat it again--He that supports every\r\nAdministration, subverts all Government.  The reason is this.  The whole\r\nbusiness in which a Court usually takes an interest goes on at present\r\nequally well, in whatever hands, whether high or low, wise or foolish,\r\nscandalous or reputable; there is nothing, therefore, to hold it firm to\r\nany one body of men, or to any one consistent scheme of politics.  Nothing\r\ninterposes to prevent the full operation of all the caprices and all the\r\npassions of a Court upon the servants of the public.  The system of\r\nAdministration is open to continual shocks and changes, upon the\r\nprinciples of the meanest cabal, and the most contemptible intrigue.\r\nNothing can be solid and permanent.  All good men at length fly with\r\nhorror from such a service.  Men of rank and ability, with the spirit\r\nwhich ought to animate such men in a free state, while they decline the\r\njurisdiction of dark cabal on their actions and their fortunes, will, for\r\nboth, cheerfully put themselves upon their country.  They will trust an\r\ninquisitive and distinguishing Parliament; because it does inquire, and\r\ndoes distinguish.  If they act well, they know that, in such a\r\nParliament, they will be supported against any intrigue; if they act ill,\r\nthey know that no intrigue can protect them.  This situation, however\r\nawful, is honourable.  But in one hour, and in the self-same Assembly,\r\nwithout any assigned or assignable cause, to be precipitated from the\r\nhighest authority to the most marked neglect, possibly into the greatest\r\nperil of life and reputation, is a situation full of danger, and\r\ndestitute of honour.  It will be shunned equally by every man of\r\nprudence, and every man of spirit.\r\n\r\nSuch are the consequences of the division of Court from the\r\nAdministration; and of the division of public men among themselves.  By\r\nthe former of these, lawful Government is undone; by the latter, all\r\nopposition to lawless power is rendered impotent.  Government may in a\r\ngreat measure be restored, if any considerable bodies of men have honesty\r\nand resolution enough never to accept Administration, unless this\r\ngarrison of _King's_ meat, which is stationed, as in a citadel, to\r\ncontrol and enslave it, be entirely broken and disbanded, and every work\r\nthey have thrown up be levelled with the ground.  The disposition of\r\npublic men to keep this corps together, and to act under it, or to co-\r\noperate with it, is a touchstone by which every Administration ought in\r\nfuture to be tried.  There has not been one which has not sufficiently\r\nexperienced the utter incompatibility of that faction with the public\r\npeace, and with all the ends of good Government; since, if they opposed\r\nit, they soon lost every power of serving the Crown; if they submitted to\r\nit they lost all the esteem of their country.  Until Ministers give to\r\nthe public a full proof of their entire alienation from that system,\r\nhowever plausible their pretences, we may be sure they are more intent on\r\nthe emoluments than the duties of office.  If they refuse to give this\r\nproof, we know of what stuff they are made.  In this particular, it ought\r\nto be the electors' business to look to their Representatives.  The\r\nelectors ought to esteem it no less culpable in their Member to give a\r\nsingle vote in Parliament to such an Administration, than to take an\r\noffice under it; to endure it, than to act in it.  The notorious\r\ninfidelity and versatility of Members of Parliament, in their opinions of\r\nmen and things, ought in a particular manner to be considered by the\r\nelectors in the inquiry which is recommended to them.  This is one of the\r\nprincipal holdings of that destructive system which has endeavoured to\r\nunhinge all the virtuous, honourable, and useful connections in the\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nThis cabal has, with great success, propagated a doctrine which serves\r\nfor a colour to those acts of treachery; and whilst it receives any\r\ndegree of countenance, it will be utterly senseless to look for a\r\nvigorous opposition to the Court Party.  The doctrine is this: That all\r\npolitical connections are in their nature factious, and as such ought to\r\nbe dissipated and destroyed; and that the rule for forming\r\nAdministrations is mere personal ability, rated by the judgment of this\r\ncabal upon it, and taken by drafts from every division and denomination\r\nof public men.  This decree was solemnly promulgated by the head of the\r\nCourt corps, the Earl of Bute himself, in a speech which he made, in the\r\nyear 1766, against the then Administration, the only Administration\r\nwhich, he has ever been known directly and publicly to oppose.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed in no way wonderful, that such persons should make such\r\ndeclarations.  That connection and faction are equivalent terms, is an\r\nopinion which has been carefully inculcated at all times by\r\nunconstitutional Statesmen.  The reason is evident.  Whilst men are\r\nlinked together, they easily and speedily communicate the alarm of an\r\nevil design.  They are enabled to fathom it with common counsel, and to\r\noppose it with united strength.  Whereas, when they lie dispersed,\r\nwithout concert, order, or discipline, communication is uncertain,\r\ncounsel difficult, and resistance impracticable.  Where men are not\r\nacquainted with each other's principles, nor experienced in each other's\r\ntalents, nor at all practised in their mutual habitudes and dispositions\r\nby joint efforts in business; no personal confidence, no friendship, no\r\ncommon interest, subsisting among them; it is evidently impossible that\r\nthey can act a public part with uniformity, perseverance, or efficacy.  In\r\na connection, the most inconsiderable man, by adding to the weight of the\r\nwhole, has his value, and his use; out of it, the greatest talents are\r\nwholly unserviceable to the public.  No man, who is not inflamed by\r\nvainglory into enthusiasm, can flatter himself that his single,\r\nunsupported, desultory, unsystematic endeavours, are of power to defeat,\r\nthe subtle designs and united cabals of ambitious citizens.  When bad men\r\ncombine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an\r\nunpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough in a situation of trust in the commonwealth, that a man\r\nmeans well to his country; it is not enough that in his single person he\r\nnever did an evil act, but always voted according to his conscience, and\r\neven harangued against every design which he apprehended to be\r\nprejudicial to the interests of his country.  This innoxious and\r\nineffectual character, that seems formed upon a plan of apology and\r\ndisculpation, falls miserably short of the mark of public duty.  That\r\nduty demands and requires, that what is right should not only be made\r\nknown, but made prevalent; that what is evil should not only be detected,\r\nbut defeated.  When the public man omits to put himself in a situation of\r\ndoing his duty with effect, it is an omission that frustrates the\r\npurposes of his trust almost as much as if he had formally betrayed it.\r\nIt is surely no very rational account of a man's life that he has always\r\nacted right; but has taken special care to act in such a manner that his\r\nendeavours could not possibly be productive of any consequence.\r\n\r\nI do not wonder that the behaviour of many parties should have made\r\npersons of tender and scrupulous virtue somewhat out of humour with all\r\nsorts of connection in politics.  I admit that people frequently acquire\r\nin such confederacies a narrow, bigoted, and proscriptive spirit; that\r\nthey are apt to sink the idea of the general good in this circumscribed\r\nand partial interest.  But, where duty renders a critical situation a\r\nnecessary one, it is our business to keep free from the evils attendant\r\nupon it, and not to fly from the situation itself.  If a fortress is\r\nseated in an unwholesome air, an officer of the garrison is obliged to be\r\nattentive to his health, but he must not desert his station.  Every\r\nprofession, not excepting the glorious one of a soldier, or the sacred\r\none of a priest, is liable to its own particular vices; which, however,\r\nform no argument against those ways of life; nor are the vices themselves\r\ninevitable to every individual in those professions.  Of such a nature\r\nare connections in politics; essentially necessary for the full\r\nperformance of our public duty, accidentally liable to degenerate into\r\nfaction.  Commonwealths are made of families, free Commonwealths of\r\nparties also; and we may as well affirm, that our natural regards and\r\nties of blood tend inevitably to make men bad citizens, as that the bonds\r\nof our party weaken those by which we are held to our country.\r\n\r\nSome legislators went so far as to make neutrality in party a crime\r\nagainst the State.  I do not know whether this might not have been rather\r\nto overstrain the principle.  Certain it is, the best patriots in the\r\ngreatest commonwealths have always commanded and promoted such\r\nconnections.  _Idem sentire de republica_, was with them a principal\r\nground of friendship and attachment; nor do I know any other capable of\r\nforming firmer, dearer, more pleasing, more honourable, and more virtuous\r\nhabitudes.  The Romans carried this principle a great way.  Even the\r\nholding of offices together, the disposition of which arose from chance,\r\nnot selection, gave rise to a relation which continued for life.  It was\r\ncalled _necessitudo sortis_; and it was looked upon with a sacred\r\nreverence.  Breaches of any of these kinds of civil relation were\r\nconsidered as acts of the most distinguished turpitude.  The whole people\r\nwas distributed into political societies, in which they acted in support\r\nof such interests in the State as they severally affected.  For it was\r\nthen thought no crime, to endeavour by every honest means to advance to\r\nsuperiority and power those of your own sentiments and opinions.  This\r\nwise people was far from imagining that those connections had no tie, and\r\nobliged to no duty; but that men might quit them without shame, upon\r\nevery call of interest.  They believed private honour to be the great\r\nfoundation of public trust; that friendship was no mean step towards\r\npatriotism; that he who, in the common intercourse of life, showed he\r\nregarded somebody besides himself, when he came to act in a public\r\nsituation, might probably consult some other interest than his own.  Never\r\nmay we become _plus sages que les sages_, as the French comedian has\r\nhappily expressed it--wiser than all the wise and good men who have lived\r\nbefore us.  It was their wish, to see public and private virtues, not\r\ndissonant and jarring, and mutually destructive, but harmoniously\r\ncombined, growing out of one another in a noble and orderly gradation,\r\nreciprocally supporting and supported.  In one of the most fortunate\r\nperiods of our history this country was governed by a connection; I mean\r\nthe great connection of Whigs in the reign of Queen Anne.  They were\r\ncomplimented upon the principle of this connection by a poet who was in\r\nhigh esteem with them.  Addison, who knew their sentiments, could not\r\npraise them for what they considered as no proper subject of\r\ncommendation.  As a poet who knew his business, he could not applaud them\r\nfor a thing which in general estimation was not highly reputable.\r\nAddressing himself to Britain,\r\n\r\n   \"Thy favourites grow not up by fortune's sport,\r\n   Or from the crimes or follies of a Court;\r\n   On the firm basis of desert they rise,\r\n   From long-tried faith, and friendship's holy ties.\"\r\n\r\nThe Whigs of those days believed that the only proper method of rising\r\ninto power was through bard essays of practised friendship and\r\nexperimented fidelity.  At that time it was not imagined that patriotism\r\nwas a bloody idol, which required the sacrifice of children and parents,\r\nor dearest connections in private life, and of all the virtues that rise\r\nfrom those relations.  They were not of that ingenious paradoxical\r\nmorality to imagine that a spirit of moderation was properly shown in\r\npatiently bearing the sufferings of your friends, or that\r\ndisinterestedness was clearly manifested at the expense of other people's\r\nfortune.  They believed that no men could act with effect who did not act\r\nin concert; that no men could act in concert who did not act with\r\nconfidence; that no men could act with confidence who were not bound\r\ntogether by common opinions, common affections, and common interests.\r\n\r\nThese wise men, for such I must call Lord Sunderland, Lord Godolphin,\r\nLord Somers, and Lord Marlborough, were too well principled in these\r\nmaxims, upon which the whole fabric of public strength is built, to be\r\nblown off their ground by the breath of every childish talker.  They were\r\nnot afraid that they should be called an ambitious Junto, or that their\r\nresolution to stand or fall together should, by placemen, be interpreted\r\ninto a scuffle for places.\r\n\r\nParty is a body of men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the\r\nnational interest, upon some particular principle in which they are all\r\nagreed.  For my part, I find it impossible to conceive that any one\r\nbelieves in his own politics, or thinks them to be of any weight, who\r\nrefuses to adopt the means of having them reduced into practice.  It is\r\nthe business of the speculative philosopher to mark the proper ends of\r\nGovernment.  It is the business of the politician, who is the philosopher\r\nin action, to find out proper means towards those ends, and to employ\r\nthem with effect.  Therefore, every honourable connection will avow it as\r\ntheir first purpose to pursue every just method to put the men who hold\r\ntheir opinions into such a condition as may enable them to carry their\r\ncommon plans into execution, with all the power and authority of the\r\nState.  As this power is attached to certain situations, it is their duty\r\nto contend for these situations.  Without a proscription of others, they\r\nare bound to give to their own party the preference in all things, and by\r\nno means, for private considerations, to accept any offers of power in\r\nwhich the whole body is not included, nor to suffer themselves to be led,\r\nor to be controlled, or to be over-balanced, in office or in council, by\r\nthose who contradict, the very fundamental principles on which their\r\nparty is formed, and even those upon which every fair connection must\r\nstand.  Such a generous contention for power, on such manly and\r\nhonourable maxims, will easily be distinguished from the mean and\r\ninterested struggle for place and emolument.  The very style of such\r\npersons will serve to discriminate them from those numberless impostors\r\nwho have deluded the ignorant with professions incompatible with human\r\npractice, and have afterwards incensed them by practices below the level\r\nof vulgar rectitude.\r\n\r\nIt is an advantage to all narrow wisdom and narrow morals that their\r\nmaxims have a plausible air, and, on a cursory view, appear equal to\r\nfirst principles.  They are light and portable.  They are as current as\r\ncopper coin, and about as valuable.  They serve equally the first\r\ncapacities and the lowest, and they are, at least, as useful to the worst\r\nmen as the best.  Of this stamp is the cant of _Not men_, _but measures_;\r\na sort of charm, by which many people got loose from every honourable\r\nengagement.  When I see a man acting this desultory and disconnected\r\npart, with as much detriment to his own fortune as prejudice to the cause\r\nof any party, I am not persuaded that he is right, but I am ready to\r\nbelieve he is in earnest.  I respect virtue in all its situations, even\r\nwhen it is found in the unsuitable company of weakness.  I lament to see\r\nqualities, rare and valuable, squandered away without any public utility.\r\nBut when a gentleman with great visible emoluments abandons the party in\r\nwhich he has long acted, and tells you it is because he proceeds upon his\r\nown judgment that he acts on the merits of the several measures as they\r\narise, and that he is obliged to follow his own conscience, and not that\r\nof others, he gives reasons which it is impossible to controvert, and\r\ndiscovers a character which it is impossible to mistake.  What shall we\r\nthink of him who never differed from a certain set of men until the\r\nmoment they lost their power, and who never agreed with them in a single\r\ninstance afterwards?  Would not such a coincidence of interest and\r\nopinion be rather fortunate?  Would it not be an extraordinary cast upon\r\nthe dice that a man's connections should degenerate into faction,\r\nprecisely at the critical moment when they lose their power or he accepts\r\na place?  When people desert their connections, the desertion is a\r\nmanifest fact, upon which a direct simple issue lies, triable by plain\r\nmen.  Whether a _measure_ of Government be right or wrong is _no matter\r\nof fact_, but a mere affair of opinion, on which men may, as they do,\r\ndispute and wrangle without end.  But whether the individual thinks the\r\nmeasure right or wrong is a point at still a greater distance from the\r\nreach of all human decision.  It is therefore very convenient to\r\npoliticians not to put the judgment of their conduct on overt acts,\r\ncognisable in any ordinary court, but upon such a matter as can be\r\ntriable only in that secret tribunal, where they are sure of being heard\r\nwith favour, or where at worst the sentence will be only private\r\nwhipping.\r\n\r\nI believe the reader would wish to find no substance in a doctrine which\r\nhas a tendency to destroy all test of character as deduced from conduct.\r\nHe will therefore excuse my adding something more towards the further\r\nclearing up a point which the great convenience of obscurity to\r\ndishonesty has been able to cover with some degree of darkness and doubt.\r\n\r\nIn order to throw an odium on political connection, these politicians\r\nsuppose it a necessary incident to it that you are blindly to follow the\r\nopinions of your party when in direct opposition to your own clear ideas,\r\na degree of servitude that no worthy man could bear the thought of\r\nsubmitting to, and such as, I believe, no connections (except some Court\r\nfactions) ever could be so senselessly tyrannical as to impose.  Men\r\nthinking freely will, in particular instances, think differently.  But\r\nstill, as the greater Part of the measures which arise in the course of\r\npublic business are related to, or dependent on, some great leading\r\ngeneral principles in Government, a man must be peculiarly unfortunate in\r\nthe choice of his political company if he does not agree with them at\r\nleast nine times in ten.  If he does not concur in these general\r\nprinciples upon which the party is founded, and which necessarily draw on\r\na concurrence in their application, he ought from the beginning to have\r\nchosen some other, more conformable to his opinions.  When the question\r\nis in its nature doubtful, or not very material, the modesty which\r\nbecomes an individual, and (in spite of our Court moralists) that\r\npartiality which becomes a well-chosen friendship, will frequently bring\r\non an acquiescence in the general sentiment.  Thus the disagreement will\r\nnaturally be rare; it will be only enough to indulge freedom, without\r\nviolating concord or disturbing arrangement.  And this is all that ever\r\nwas required for a character of the greatest uniformity and steadiness in\r\nconnection.  How men can proceed without any connection at all is to me\r\nutterly incomprehensible.  Of what sort of materials must that man be\r\nmade, how must he be tempered and put together, who can sit whole years\r\nin Parliament, with five hundred and fifty of his fellow-citizens, amidst\r\nthe storm of such tempestuous passions, in the sharp conflict of so many\r\nwits, and tempers, and characters, in the agitation of such mighty\r\nquestions, in the discussion of such vast and ponderous interests,\r\nwithout seeing any one sort of men, whose character, conduct, or\r\ndisposition would lead him to associate himself with them, to aid and be\r\naided, in any one system of public utility?\r\n\r\nI remember an old scholastic aphorism, which says that \"the man who lives\r\nwholly detached from others must be either an angel or a devil.\"  When I\r\nsee in any of these detached gentlemen of our times the angelic purity,\r\npower, and beneficence, I shall admit them to be angels.  In the\r\nmeantime, we are born only to be men.  We shall do enough if we form\r\nourselves to be good ones.  It is therefore our business carefully to\r\ncultivate in our minds, to rear to the most perfect vigour and maturity,\r\nevery sort of generous and honest feeling that belongs to our nature.  To\r\nbring the, dispositions that are lovely in private life into the service\r\nand conduct of the commonwealth; so to be patriots, as not to forget we\r\nare gentlemen.  To cultivate friendships, and to incur enmities.  To have\r\nboth strong, but both selected: in the one, to be placable; in the other,\r\nimmovable.  To model our principles to our duties and our situation.  To\r\nbe fully persuaded that all virtue which is impracticable is spurious,\r\nand rather to run the risk of falling into faults in a course which leads\r\nus to act with effect and energy than to loiter out our days without\r\nblame and without use.  Public life is a situation of power and energy;\r\nhe trespasses against his duty who sleeps upon his watch, as well as he\r\nthat goes over to the enemy.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, a time for all things.  It is not every conjuncture\r\nwhich calls with equal force upon the activity of honest men; but\r\ncritical exigences now and then arise, and I am mistaken if this be not\r\none of them.  Men will see the necessity of honest combination, but they\r\nmay see it when it is too late.  They may embody when it will be ruinous\r\nto themselves, and of no advantage to the country; when, for want of such\r\na timely union as may enable them to oppose in favour of the laws, with\r\nthe laws on their side, they may at length find themselves under the\r\nnecessity of conspiring, instead of consulting.  The law, for which they\r\nstand, may become a weapon in the hands of its bitterest enemies; and\r\nthey will be cast, at length, into that miserable alternative, between\r\nslavery and civil confusion, which no good man can look upon without\r\nhorror, an alternative in which it is impossible he should take either\r\npart with a conscience perfectly at repose.  To keep that situation of\r\nguilt and remorse at the utmost distance is, therefore, our first\r\nobligation.  Early activity may prevent late and fruitless violence.  As\r\nyet we work in the light.  The scheme of the enemies of public\r\ntranquillity has disarranged, it has not destroyed us.\r\n\r\nIf the reader believes that there really exists such a Faction as I have\r\ndescribed, a Faction ruling by the private inclinations of a Court,\r\nagainst the general sense of the people; and that this Faction, whilst it\r\npursues a scheme for undermining all the foundations of our freedom,\r\nweakens (for the present at least) all the powers of executory\r\nGovernment, rendering us abroad contemptible, and at home distracted; he\r\nwill believe, also, that nothing but a firm combination of public men\r\nagainst this body, and that, too, supported by the hearty concurrence of\r\nthe people at large, can possibly get the better of it.  The people will\r\nsee the necessity of restoring public men to an attention to the public\r\nopinion, and of restoring the Constitution to its original principles.\r\nAbove all, they will endeavour to keep the House of Commons from assuming\r\na character which does not belong to it.  They will endeavour to keep\r\nthat House, for its existence for its powers, and its privileges, as\r\nindependent of every other, and as dependent upon themselves, as\r\npossible.  This servitude is to a House of Commons (like obedience to the\r\nDivine law), \"perfect freedom.\"  For if they once quit this natural,\r\nrational, and liberal obedience, having deserted the only proper\r\nfoundation of their power, they must seek a support in an abject and\r\nunnatural dependence somewhere else.  When, through the medium of this\r\njust connection with their constituents, the genuine dignity of the House\r\nof Commons is restored, it will begin to think of casting from it, with\r\nscorn, as badges of servility, all the false ornaments of illegal power,\r\nwith which it has been, for some time, disgraced.  It will begin to think\r\nof its old office of CONTROL.  It will not suffer that last of evils to\r\npredominate in the country; men without popular confidence, public\r\nopinion, natural connection, or natural trust, invested with all the\r\npowers of Government.\r\n\r\nWhen they have learned this lesson themselves, they will be willing and\r\nable to teach the Court, that it is the true interest of the Prince to\r\nhave but one Administration; and that one composed of those who recommend\r\nthemselves to their Sovereign through the opinion of their country, and\r\nnot by their obsequiousness to a favourite.  Such men will serve their\r\nSovereign with affection and fidelity; because his choice of them, upon\r\nsuch principles, is a compliment to their virtue.  They will be able to\r\nserve him effectually; because they will add the weight of the country to\r\nthe force of the executory power.  They will be able to serve their King\r\nwith dignity; because they will never abuse his name to the gratification\r\nof their private spleen or avarice.  This, with allowances for human\r\nfrailty, may probably be the general character of a Ministry, which\r\nthinks itself accountable to the House of Commons, when the House of\r\nCommons thinks itself accountable to its constituents.  If other ideas\r\nshould prevail, things must remain in their present confusion, until they\r\nare hurried into all the rage of civil violence; or until they sink into\r\nthe dead repose of despotism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON THE MIDDLESEX ELECTION\r\nFEBRUARY, 1771\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker,--In every complicated Constitution (and every free\r\nConstitution is complicated) cases will arise, when the several orders of\r\nthe State will clash with one another, and disputes will arise about the\r\nlimits of their several rights and privileges.  It may be almost\r\nimpossible to reconcile them.\r\n\r\nCarry the principle on by which you expelled Mr. Wilkes, there is not a\r\nman in the House, hardly a man in the nation, who may not be\r\ndisqualified.  That this House should have no power of expulsion is a\r\nhard saying.  That this House should have a general discretionary power\r\nof disqualification is a dangerous saying.  That the people should not\r\nchoose their own representative, is a saying that shakes the\r\nConstitution.  That this House should name the representative, is a\r\nsaying which, followed by practice, subverts the constitution.  They have\r\nthe right of electing, you have a right of expelling; they of choosing,\r\nyou of judging, and only of judging, of the choice.  What bounds shall be\r\nset to the freedom of that choice?  Their right is prior to ours, we all\r\noriginate there.  They are the mortal enemies of the House of Commons,\r\nwho would persuade them to think or to act as if they were a\r\nself-originated magistracy, independent of the people and unconnected\r\nwith their opinions and feelings.  Under a pretence of exalting the\r\ndignity, they undermine the very foundations of this House.  When the\r\nquestion is asked here, what disturbs the people, whence all this\r\nclamour, we apply to the treasury-bench, and they tell us it is from the\r\nefforts of libellers and the wickedness of the people, a worn-out\r\nministerial pretence.  If abroad the people are deceived by popular,\r\nwithin we are deluded by ministerial, cant.  The question amounts to\r\nthis, whether you mean to be a legal tribunal, or an arbitrary and\r\ndespotic assembly.  I see and I feel the delicacy and difficulty of the\r\nground upon which we stand in this question.  I could wish, indeed, that\r\nthey who advised the Crown had not left Parliament in this very\r\nungraceful distress, in which they can neither retract with dignity nor\r\npersist with justice.  Another parliament might have satisfied the people\r\nwithout lowering themselves.  But our situation is not in our own choice:\r\nour conduct in that situation is all that is in our own option.  The\r\nsubstance of the question is, to put bounds to your own power by the\r\nrules and principles of law.  This is, I am sensible, a difficult thing\r\nto the corrupt, grasping, and ambitious part of human nature.  But the\r\nvery difficulty argues and enforces the necessity of it.  First, because\r\nthe greater the power, the more dangerous the abuse.  Since the\r\nRevolution, at least, the power of the nation has all flowed with a full\r\ntide into the House of Commons.  Secondly, because the House of Commons,\r\nas it is the most powerful, is the most corruptible part of the whole\r\nConstitution.  Our public wounds cannot be concealed; to be cured, they\r\nmust be laid open.  The public does think we are a corrupt body.  In our\r\nlegislative capacity we are, in most instances, esteemed a very wise\r\nbody.  In our judicial, we have no credit, no character at, all.  Our\r\njudgments stink in the nostrils of the people.  They think us to be not\r\nonly without virtue, but without shame.  Therefore, the greatness of our\r\npower, and the great and just opinion of our corruptibility and our\r\ncorruption, render it necessary to fix some bound, to plant some\r\nlandmark, which we are never to exceed.  That is what the bill proposes.\r\nFirst, on this head, I lay it down as a fundamental rule in the law and\r\nconstitution of this country, that this House has not by itself alone a\r\nlegislative authority in any case whatsoever.  I know that the contrary\r\nwas the doctrine of the usurping House of Commons which threw down the\r\nfences and bulwarks of law, which annihilated first the lords, then the\r\nCrown, then its constituents.  But the first thing that was done on the\r\nrestoration of the Constitution was to settle this point.  Secondly, I\r\nlay it down as a rule, that the power of occasional incapacitation, on\r\ndiscretionary grounds, is a legislative power.  In order to establish\r\nthis principle, if it should not be sufficiently proved by being stated,\r\ntell me what are the criteria, the characteristics, by which you\r\ndistinguish between a legislative and a juridical act.  It will be\r\nnecessary to state, shortly, the difference between a legislative and a\r\njuridical act.  A legislative act has no reference to any rule but these\r\ntwo: original justice, and discretionary application.  Therefore, it can\r\ngive rights; rights where no rights existed before; and it can take away\r\nrights where they were before established.  For the law, which binds all\r\nothers, does not and cannot bind the law-maker; he, and he alone, is\r\nabove the law.  But a judge, a person exercising a judicial capacity, is\r\nneither to apply to original justice, nor to a discretionary application\r\nof it.  He goes to justice and discretion only at second hand, and\r\nthrough the medium of some superiors.  He is to work neither upon his\r\nopinion of the one nor of the other; but upon a fixed rule, of which he\r\nhas not the making, but singly and solely the application to the case.\r\n\r\nThe power assumed by the House neither is, nor can be, judicial power\r\nexercised according to known law.  The properties of law are, first, that\r\nit should be known; secondly, that it should be fixed and not occasional.\r\nFirst, this power cannot be according to the first property of law;\r\nbecause no man does or can know it, nor do you yourselves know upon what\r\ngrounds you will vote the incapacity of any man.  No man in Westminster\r\nHall, or in any court upon earth, will say that is law, upon which, if a\r\nman going to his counsel should say to him, \"What is my tenure in law of\r\nthis estate?\" he would answer, \"Truly, sir, I know not; the court has no\r\nrule but its own discretion: they will determine.\"  It is not a, fixed\r\nlaw, because you profess you vary it according to the occasion, exercise\r\nit according to your discretion; no man can call for it as a right.  It\r\nis argued that the incapacity is not originally voted, but a consequence\r\nof a power of expulsion: but if you expel, not upon legal, but upon\r\narbitrary, that is, upon discretionary grounds, and the incapacity is _ex\r\nvi termini_ and inclusively comprehended in the expulsion, is not the\r\nincapacity voted in the expulsion?  Are they not convertible terms? and,\r\nif incapacity is voted to be inherent in expulsion, if expulsion be\r\narbitrary, incapacity is arbitrary also.  I have, therefore, shown that\r\nthe power of incapacitation is a legislative power; I have shown that\r\nlegislative power does not belong to the House of Commons; and,\r\ntherefore, it follows that the House of Commons has not a power of\r\nincapacitation.\r\n\r\nI know not the origin of the House of Commons, but am very sure that it\r\ndid not create itself; the electors wore prior to the elected; whose\r\nrights originated either from the people at large, or from some other\r\nform of legislature, which never could intend for the chosen a power of\r\nsuperseding the choosers.\r\n\r\nIf you have not a power of declaring an incapacity simply by the mere act\r\nof declaring it, it is evident to the most ordinary reason you cannot\r\nhave a right of expulsion, inferring, or rather, including, an\r\nincapacity, For as the law, when it gives any direct right, gives also as\r\nnecessary incidents all the means of acquiring the possession of that\r\nright, so where it does not give a right directly, it refuses all the\r\nmeans by which such a right may by any mediums be exercised, or in effect\r\nbe indirectly acquired.  Else it is very obvious that the intention of\r\nthe law in refusing that right might be entirely frustrated, and the\r\nwhole power of the legislature baffled.  If there be no certain\r\ninvariable rule of eligibility, it were better to get simplicity, if\r\ncertainty is not to be had; and to resolve all the franchises of the\r\nsubject into this one short proposition--the will and pleasure of the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe argument, drawn from the courts of law, applying the principles of\r\nlaw to new cases as they emerge, is altogether frivolous, inapplicable,\r\nand arises from a total ignorance of the bounds between civil and\r\ncriminal jurisdiction, and of the separate maxims that govern these two\r\nprovinces of law, that are eternally separate.  Undoubtedly the courts of\r\nlaw, where a new case comes before them, as they do every hour, then,\r\nthat there may be no defect in justice, call in similar principles, and\r\nthe example of the nearest determination, and do everything to draw the\r\nlaw to as near a conformity to general equity and right reason as they\r\ncan bring it with its being a fixed principle.  _Boni judicis est\r\nampliare justitiam_--that is, to make open and liberal justice.  But in\r\ncriminal matters this parity of reason, and these analogies, ever have\r\nbeen, and ever ought to be, shunned.\r\n\r\nWhatever is incident to a court of judicature, is necessary to the House\r\nof Commons, as judging in elections.  But a power of making incapacities\r\nis not necessary to a court of judicature; therefore a power of making\r\nincapacities is not necessary to the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nIncapacity, declared by whatever authority, stands upon two principles:\r\nfirst, an incapacity arising from the supposed incongruity of two duties\r\nin the commonwealth; secondly, an incapacity arising from unfitness by\r\ninfirmity of nature, or the criminality of conduct.  As to the first\r\nclass of incapacities, they have no hardship annexed to them.  The\r\npersons so incapacitated are paid by one dignity for what they abandon in\r\nanother, and, for the most part, the situation arises from their own\r\nchoice.  But as to the second, arising from an unfitness not fixed by\r\nnature, but superinduced by some positive acts, or arising from\r\nhonourable motives, such as an occasional personal disability, of all\r\nthings it ought to be defined by the fixed rule of law--what Lord Coke\r\ncalls the Golden Metwand of the Law, and not by the crooked cord of\r\ndiscretion.  Whatever is general is better born.  We take our common lot\r\nwith men of the same description.  But to be selected and marked out by a\r\nparticular brand of unworthiness among our fellow-citizens, is a lot of\r\nall others the hardest to be borne: and consequently is of all others\r\nthat act which ought only to be trusted to the legislature, as not only\r\nlegislative in its nature, but of all parts of legislature the most\r\nodious.  The question is over, if this is shown not to be a legislative\r\nact.  But what is very usual and natural, is to corrupt judicature into\r\nlegislature.  On this point it is proper to inquire whether a court of\r\njudicature, which decides without appeal, has it as a necessary incident\r\nof such judicature, that whatever it decides _de jure_ is law.  Nobody\r\nwill, I hope, assert this, because the direct consequence would be the\r\nentire extinction of the difference between true and false judgments.\r\nFor, if the judgment makes the law, and not the law directs the judgment,\r\nit is impossible there could be such a thing as an illegal judgment\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nBut, instead of standing upon this ground, they introduce another\r\nquestion, wholly foreign to it, whether it ought not to be submitted to\r\nas if it were law.  And then the question is, By the Constitution of this\r\ncountry, what degree of submission is due to the authoritative acts of a\r\nlimited power?  This question of submission, determine it how you please,\r\nhas nothing to do in this discussion and in this House.  Here it is not\r\nhow long the people are bound to tolerate the illegality of our\r\njudgments, but whether we have a right to substitute our occasional\r\nopinion in the place of law, so as to deprive the citizen of his\r\nfranchise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON THE POWERS OF JURIES IN PROSECUTIONS FOR LIBELS\r\nMARCH, 1771\r\n\r\n\r\nI have always understood that a superintendence over the doctrines, as\r\nwell as the proceedings, of the courts of justice, was a principal object\r\nof the constitution of this House; that you were to watch at once over\r\nthe lawyer and the law; that there should he an orthodox faith as well as\r\nproper works: and I have always looked with a degree of reverence and\r\nadmiration on this mode of superintendence.  For being totally disengaged\r\nfrom the detail of juridical practice, we come to something, perhaps, the\r\nbetter qualified, and certainly much the better disposed to assert the\r\ngenuine principle of the laws; in which we can, as a body, have no other\r\nthan an enlarged and a public interest.  We have no common cause of a\r\nprofessional attachment, or professional emulations, to bias our minds;\r\nwe have no foregone opinions, which, from obstinacy and false point of\r\nhonour, we think ourselves at all events obliged to support.  So that\r\nwith our own minds perfectly disengaged from the exercise, we may\r\nsuperintend the execution of the national justice; which from this\r\ncircumstance is better secured to the people than in any other country\r\nunder heaven it can be.  As our situation puts us in a proper condition,\r\nour power enables us to execute this trust.  We may, when we see cause of\r\ncomplaint, administer a remedy; it is in our choice by an address to\r\nremove an improper judge, by impeachment before the peers to pursue to\r\ndestruction a corrupt judge, or by bill to assert, to explain, to\r\nenforce, or to reform the law, just as the occasion and necessity of the\r\ncase shall guide us.  We stand in a situation very honourable to\r\nourselves, and very useful to our country, if we do not abuse or abandon\r\nthe trust that is placed in us.\r\n\r\nThe question now before you is upon the power of juries in prosecuting\r\nfor libels.  There are four opinions.  1. That the doctrine as held by\r\nthe courts is proper and constitutional, and therefore should not be\r\naltered.  2. That it is neither proper nor constitutional, but that it\r\nwill be rendered worse by your interference.  3. That it is wrong, but\r\nthat the only remedy is a bill of retrospect.  4. The opinion of those\r\nwho bring in the bill; that the thing is wrong, but that it is enough to\r\ndirect the judgment of the court in future.\r\n\r\nThe bill brought in is for the purpose of asserting and securing a great\r\nobject in the juridical constitution of this kingdom; which, from a long\r\nseries of practices and opinions in our judges, has, in one point, and in\r\none very essential point, deviated from the true principle.\r\n\r\nIt is the very ancient privilege of the people of England that they shall\r\nbe tried, except in the known exceptions, not by judges appointed by the\r\nCrown, but by their own fellow-subjects, the peers of that county court\r\nat which they owe their suit and service; out of this principle trial by\r\njuries has grown.  This principle has not, that I can find, been\r\ncontested in any case, by any authority whatsoever; but there is one\r\ncase, in which, without directly contesting the principle, the whole\r\nsubstance, energy, acid virtue of the privilege, is taken out of it; that\r\nis, in the case of a trial by indictment or information for libel.  The\r\ndoctrine in that case laid down by several judges amounts to this, that\r\nthe jury have no competence where a libel is alleged, except to find the\r\ngross corporeal facts of the writing and the publication, together with\r\nthe identity of the things and persons to which it refers; but that the\r\nintent and the tendency of the work, in which intent and tendency the\r\nwhole criminality consists, is the sole and exclusive province of the\r\njudge.  Thus having reduced the jury to the cognisance of facts, not in\r\nthemselves presumptively criminal, but actions neutral and indifferent\r\nthe whole matter, in which the subject has any concern or interest, is\r\ntaken out of the hands of the jury: and if the jury take more upon\r\nthemselves, what they so take is contrary to their duty; it is no moral,\r\nbut a merely natural power; the same, by which they may do any other\r\nimproper act, the same, by which they may even prejudice themselves with\r\nregard to any other part of the issue before them.  Such is the matter as\r\nit now stands, in possession of your highest criminal courts, handed down\r\nto them from very respectable legal ancestors.  If this can once be\r\nestablished in this case, the application in principle to other cases\r\nwill be easy; and the practice will run upon a descent, until the\r\nprogress of an encroaching jurisdiction (for it is in its nature to\r\nencroach, when once it has passed its limits) coming to confine the\r\njuries, case after case, to the corporeal fact, and to that alone, and\r\nexcluding the intention of mind, the only source of merit and demerit, of\r\nreward or punishment, juries become a dead letter in the constitution.\r\n\r\nFor which reason it is high time to take this matter into the\r\nconsideration of Parliament, and for that purpose it will be necessary to\r\nexamine, first, whether there is anything in the peculiar nature of this\r\ncrime that makes it necessary to exclude the jury from considering the\r\nintention in it, more than in others.  So far from it, that I take it to\r\nbe much less so from the analogy of other criminal cases, where no such\r\nrestraint is ordinarily put upon them.  The act of homicide is _prima\r\nfacie_ criminal.  The intention is afterwards to appear, for the jury to\r\nacquit or condemn.  In burglary do they insist that the jury have nothing\r\nto do but to find the taking of goods, and that, if they do, they must\r\nnecessarily find the party guilty, and leave the rest to the judge; and\r\nthat they have nothing to do with the word _felonice_ in the indictment?\r\n\r\nThe next point is to consider it as a question of constitutional policy,\r\nthat is, whether the decision of the question of libel ought to be left\r\nto the judges as a presumption of law, rather than to the jury as matter\r\nof popular judgment, as the malice in the case of murder, the felony in\r\nthe case of stealing.  If the intent and tendency are not matters within\r\nthe province of popular judgment, but legal and technical conclusions,\r\nformed upon general principles of law, let us see what they are.\r\nCertainly they are most unfavourable, indeed, totally adverse, to the\r\nConstitution of this country.\r\n\r\nHere we must have recourse to analogies, for we cannot argue on ruled\r\ncases one way or the other.  See the history.  The old books, deficient\r\nin general in Crown cases furnish us with little on this head.  As to the\r\ncrime, in the very early Saxon Law, I see an offence of this species,\r\ncalled Folk-leasing, made a capital offence, but no very precise\r\ndefinition of the crime, and no trial at all: see the statute of 3rd\r\nEdward I. cap. 34.  The law of libels could not have arrived at a very\r\nearly period in this country.  It is no wonder that we find no vestige of\r\nany constitution from authority, or of any deductions from legal science\r\nin our old books and records upon that subject.  The statute of\r\n_scandalum magnatum_ is the oldest that I know, and this goes but a\r\nlittle way in this sort of learning.  Libelling is not the crime of an\r\nilliterate people.  When they were thought no mean clerks who could read\r\nand write, when he who could read and write was presumptively a person in\r\nholy orders, libels could not be general or dangerous; and scandals\r\nmerely oral could spread little, and must perish soon.  It is writing, it\r\nis printing more emphatically, that imps calumny with those eagle wings,\r\non which, as the poet says, \"immortal slanders fly.\"  By the press they\r\nspread, they last, they leave the sting in the wound.  Printing was not\r\nknown in England much earlier than the reign of Henry VII., and in the\r\nthird year of that reign the Court of Star Chamber was established.  The\r\npress and its enemy are nearly coeval.  As no positive law against libels\r\nexisted, they fell under the indefinite class of misdemeanours.  For the\r\ntrial of misdemeanours that court was instituted, their tendency to\r\nproduce riots and disorders was a main part of the charge, and was laid,\r\nin order to give the court jurisdiction chiefly against libels.  The\r\noffence was new.  Learning of their own upon the subject they had none,\r\nand they were obliged to resort to the only emporium where it was to be\r\nhad, the Roman Law.  After the Star Chamber was abolished in the 10th of\r\nCharles I. its authority indeed ceased, but its maxims subsisted and\r\nsurvived it.  The spirit of the Star Chamber has transmigrated and lived\r\nagain, and Westminster Hall was obliged to borrow from the Star Chamber,\r\nfor the same reasons as the Star Chamber had borrowed from the Roman\r\nForum, because they had no law, statute, or tradition of their own.  Thus\r\nthe Roman Law took possession of our courts, I mean its doctrine, not its\r\nsanctions; the severity of capital punishment was omitted, all the rest\r\nremained.  The grounds of these laws are just and equitable.  Undoubtedly\r\nthe good fame of every man ought to be under the protection of the laws\r\nas well as his life, and liberty, and property.  Good fame is an outwork,\r\nthat defends them all, and renders them all valuable.  The law forbids\r\nyou to revenge; when it ties up the hands of some, it ought to restrain\r\nthe tongues of others.  The good fame of government is the same, it ought\r\nnot to be traduced.  This is necessary in all government, and if opinion\r\nbe support, what takes away this destroys that support; but the liberty\r\nof the press is necessary to this government.\r\n\r\nThe wisdom, however, of government is of more importance than the laws.  I\r\nshould study the temper of the people before I ventured on actions of\r\nthis kind.  I would consider the whole of the prosecution of a libel of\r\nsuch importance as Junius, as one piece, as one consistent plan of\r\noperations; and I would contrive it so that, if I were defeated, I should\r\nnot be disgraced; that even my victory should not be more ignominious\r\nthan my defeat; I would so manage, that the lowest in the predicament of\r\nguilt should not be the only one in punishment.  I would not inform\r\nagainst the mere vender of a collection of pamphlets.  I would not put\r\nhim to trial first, if I could possibly avoid it.  I would rather stand\r\nthe consequences of my first error, than carry it to a judgment that must\r\ndisgrace my prosecution, or the court.  We ought to examine these things\r\nin a manner which becomes ourselves, and becomes the object of the\r\ninquiry; not to examine into the most important consideration which can\r\ncome before us, with minds heated with prejudice and filled with\r\npassions, with vain popular opinions and humours, and when we propose to\r\nexamine into the justice of others, to be unjust ourselves.\r\n\r\nAn inquiry is wished, as the most effectual way of putting an end to the\r\nclamours and libels, which are the disorder and disgrace of the times.\r\nFor people remain quiet, they sleep secure, when they imagine that the\r\nvigilant eye of a censorial magistrate watches over all the proceedings\r\nof judicature, and that the sacred fire of an eternal constitutional\r\njealousy, which is the guardian of liberty, law, and justice, is alive\r\nnight and day, and burning in this house.  But when the magistrate gives\r\nup his office and his duty, the people assume it, and they inquire too\r\nmuch, and too irreverently, because they think their representatives do\r\nnot inquire at all.\r\n\r\nWe have in a libel, 1st.  The writing.  2nd.  The communication, called\r\nby the lawyers the publication.  3rd.  The application to persons and\r\nfacts.  4th.  The intent and tendency.  5th.  The matter--diminution of\r\nfame.  The law presumptions on all these are in the communication.  No\r\nintent can, make a defamatory publication good, nothing can make it have\r\na good tendency; truth is not pleadable.  Taken juridically, the\r\nfoundation of these law presumptions is not unjust; taken\r\nconstitutionally, they are ruinous, and tend to the total suppression of\r\nall publication.  If juries are confined to the fact, no writing which\r\ncensures, however justly, or however temperately, the conduct of\r\nadministration, can be unpunished.  Therefore, if the intent and tendency\r\nbe left to the judge, as legal conclusions growing from the fact, you may\r\ndepend upon it you can have no public discussion of a public measure,\r\nwhich is a point which even those who are most offended with the\r\nlicentiousness of the press (and it is very exorbitant, very provoking)\r\nwill hardly contend for.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the first opinion, that the doctrine is right and needs no\r\nalteration. 2nd.  The next is, that it is wrong, but that we are not in a\r\ncondition to help it.  I admit, it is true, that there are cases of a\r\nnature so delicate and complicated, that an Act of Parliament on the\r\nsubject may become a matter of great difficulty.  It sometimes cannot\r\ndefine with exactness, because the subject-matter will not bear an exact\r\ndefinition.  It may seem to take away everything which it does not\r\npositively establish, and this might be inconvenient; or it may seem\r\n_vice versa_ to establish everything which it does not expressly take\r\naway.  It may be more advisable to leave such matters to the enlightened\r\ndiscretion of a judge, awed by a censorial House of Commons.  But then it\r\nrests upon those who object to a legislative interposition to prove these\r\ninconveniences in the particular case before them.  For it would be a\r\nmost dangerous, as it is a most idle and most groundless, conceit to\r\nassume as a general principle, that the rights and liberties of the\r\nsubject are impaired by the care and attention of the legislature to\r\nsecure them.  If so, very ill would the purchase of Magna Charta have\r\nmerited the deluge of blood, which was shed in order to have the body of\r\nEnglish privileges defined by a positive written law.  This charter, the\r\ninestimable monument of English freedom, so long the boast and glory of\r\nthis nation, would have been at once an instrument of our servitude, and\r\na monument of our folly, if this principle were true.  The thirty four\r\nconfirmations would have been only so many repetitions of their\r\nabsurdity, so many new links in the chain, and so many invalidations of\r\ntheir right.\r\n\r\nYou cannot open your statute book without seeing positive provisions\r\nrelative to every right of the subject.  This business of juries is the\r\nsubject of not fewer than a dozen.  To suppose that juries are something\r\ninnate in the Constitution of Great Britain, that they have jumped, like\r\nMinerva, out of the head of Jove in complete armour, is a weak fancy,\r\nsupported neither by precedent nor by reason.  Whatever is most ancient\r\nand venerable in our Constitution, royal prerogative, privileges of\r\nparliament, rights of elections, authority of courts, juries, must have\r\nbeen modelled according to the occasion.  I spare your patience, and I\r\npay a compliment to your understanding, in not attempting to prove that\r\nanything so elaborate and artificial as a jury was not the work of\r\nchance, but a matter of institution, brought to its present state by the\r\njoint efforts of legislative authority and juridical prudence.  It need\r\nnot be ashamed of being (what in many parts of it at least it is) the\r\noffspring of an Act of Parliament, unless it is a shame for our laws to\r\nbe the results of our legislature.  Juries, which sensitively shrank from\r\nthe rude touch of parliamentary remedy, have been the subject of not\r\nfewer than, I think, forty-three Acts of Parliament, in which they have\r\nbeen changed with all the authority of a creator over its creature, from\r\nMagna Charta to the great alterations which were made in the 29th of\r\nGeorge II.\r\n\r\nTo talk of this matter in any other way is to turn a rational principle\r\ninto an idle and vulgar superstition, like the antiquary, Dr. Woodward,\r\nwho trembled to have his shield scoured, for fear it should be discovered\r\nto be no better than an old pot-lid.  This species of tenderness to a\r\njury puts me in mind of a gentleman of good condition, who had been\r\nreduced to great poverty and distress; application was made to some rich\r\nfellows in his neighbourhood to give him some assistance; but they begged\r\nto be excused for fear of affronting a person of his high birth; and so\r\nthe poor gentleman was left to starve out of pure respect to the\r\nantiquity of his family.  From this principle has risen an opinion that I\r\nfind current amongst gentlemen, that this distemper ought to be left to\r\ncure itself; that the judges having been well exposed, and something\r\nterrified on account of these clamours, will entirely change, if not very\r\nmuch relax from their rigour; if the present race should not change, that\r\nthe chances of succession may put other more constitutional judges in\r\ntheir place; lastly, if neither should happen, yet that the spirit of an\r\nEnglish jury will always be sufficient for the vindication of its own\r\nrights, and will not suffer itself to be overborne by the bench.  I\r\nconfess that I totally dissent from all these opinions.  These\r\nsuppositions become the strongest reasons with me to evince the necessity\r\nof some clear and positive settlement of this question of contested\r\njurisdiction.  If judges are so full of levity, so full of timidity, if\r\nthey are influenced by such mean and unworthy passions, that a popular\r\nclamour is sufficient to shake the resolution they build upon the solid\r\nbasis of a legal principle, I would endeavour to fix that mercury by a\r\npositive law.  If to please an administration the judges can go one way\r\nto-day, and to please the crowd they can go another to-morrow; if they\r\nwill oscillate backward and forward between power and popularity, it is\r\nhigh time to fix the law in such a manner as to resemble, as it ought,\r\nthe great Author of all law, in \"whom there is no variableness nor shadow\r\nof turning.\"\r\n\r\nAs to their succession, I have just the same opinion.  I would not leave\r\nit to the chances of promotion, or to the characters of lawyers, what the\r\nlaw of the land, what the rights of juries, or what the liberty of the\r\npress should be.  My law should not depend upon the fluctuation of the\r\ncloset, or the complexion of men.  Whether a black-haired man or a fair-\r\nhaired man presided in the Court of King's Bench, I would have the law\r\nthe same: the same whether he was born in _domo regnatrice_, and sucked\r\nfrom his infancy the milk of courts, or was nurtured in the rugged\r\ndiscipline of a popular opposition.  This law of court cabal and of\r\nparty, this _mens quaedam nullo perturbata affectu_, this law of\r\ncomplexion, ought not to be endured for a moment in a country whose being\r\ndepends upon the certainty, clearness, and stability of institutions.\r\n\r\nNow I come to the last substitute for the proposed bill, the spirit of\r\njuries operating their own jurisdiction.  This, I confess, I think the\r\nworst of all, for the same reasons on which I objected to the others, and\r\nfor other weighty reasons besides which are separate and distinct.  First,\r\nbecause juries, being taken at random out of a mass of men infinitely\r\nlarge, must be of characters as various as the body they arise from is\r\nlarge in its extent.  If the judges differ in their complexions, much\r\nmore will a jury.  A timid jury will give way to an awful judge\r\ndelivering oracularly the law, and charging them on their oaths, and\r\nputting it home to their consciences, to beware of judging where the law\r\nhad given them no competence.  We know that they will do so, they have\r\ndone so in a hundred instances; a respectable member of your own house,\r\nno vulgar man, tells you that on the authority of a judge he found a man\r\nguilty, in whom, at the same time, he could find no guilt.  But supposing\r\nthem full of knowledge and full of manly confidence in themselves, how\r\nwill their knowledge, or their confidence, inform or inspirit others?\r\nThey give no reason for their verdict, they can but condemn or acquit;\r\nand no man can tell the motives on which they have acquitted or\r\ncondemned.  So that this hope of the power of juries to assert their own\r\njurisdiction must be a principle blind, as being without reason, and as\r\nchangeable as the complexion of men and the temper of the times.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, is it fit that this dishonourable contention between the\r\ncourt and juries should subsist any longer?  On what principle is it that\r\na jury refuses to be directed by the court as to his competence?  Whether\r\na libel or no libel be a question of law or of fact may be doubted, but a\r\nquestion of jurisdiction and competence is certainly a question of law;\r\non this the court ought undoubtedly to judge, and to judge solely and\r\nexclusively.  If they judge wrong from excusable error, you ought to\r\ncorrect it, as to-day it is proposed, by an explanatory bill; or if by\r\ncorruption, by bill of penalties declaratory, and by punishment.  What\r\ndoes a juror say to a judge when he refuses his opinion upon a question\r\nof judicature?  You are so corrupt, that I should consider myself a\r\npartaker of your crime, were I to be guided by your opinion; or you are\r\nso grossly ignorant, that I, fresh from my bounds, from my plough, my\r\ncounter, or my loom, am fit to direct you in your profession.  This is an\r\nunfitting, it is a dangerous, state of things.  The spirit of any sort of\r\nmen is not a fit rule for deciding on the bounds of their jurisdiction.\r\nFirst, because it is different in different men, and even different in\r\nthe same at different times; and can never become the proper directing\r\nline of law; next, because it is not reason, but feeling; and when once\r\nit is irritated, it is not apt to confine itself within its proper\r\nlimits.  If it becomes, not difference in opinion upon law, but a trial\r\nof spirit between parties, our courts of law are no longer the temple of\r\njustice, but the amphitheatre for gladiators.  No--God forbid!  Juries\r\nought to take their law from the bench only; but it is our business that\r\nthey should hear nothing from the bench but what is agreeable to the\r\nprinciples of the Constitution.  The jury are to hear the judge, the\r\njudge is to hear the law where it speaks plain; where it does not, he is\r\nto hear the legislature.  As I do not think these opinions of the judges\r\nto be agreeable to those principles, I wish to take the only method in\r\nwhich they can or ought to be corrected, by bill.\r\n\r\nNext, my opinion is, that it ought to be rather by a bill for removing\r\ncontroversies than by a bill in the state of manifest and express\r\ndeclaration, and in words _de praeterito_.  I do this upon reasons of\r\nequity and constitutional policy.  I do not want to censure the present\r\njudges.  I think them to be excused for their error.  Ignorance is no\r\nexcuse for a judge: it is changing the nature of his crime--it is not\r\nabsolving.  It must be such error as a wise and conscientious judge may\r\npossibly fall into, and must arise from one or both these causes: first,\r\na plausible principle of law; secondly, the precedents of respectable\r\nauthorities, and in good times.  In the first, the principle of law, that\r\nthe judge is to decide on law, the jury to decide on fact, is an ancient\r\nand venerable principle and maxim of the law, and if supported in this\r\napplication by precedents of good times and of good men, the judge, if\r\nwrong, ought to be corrected; he ought not to be reproved, or to be\r\ndisgraced, or the authority or respect to your tribunals to be impaired.\r\nIn cases in which declaratory bills have been made, where by violence and\r\ncorruption some fundamental part of the Constitution has been struck at;\r\nwhere they would damn the principle, censure the persons, and annul the\r\nacts; but where the law having been, by the accident of human frailty,\r\ndepraved, or in a particular instance misunderstood, where you neither\r\nmean to rescind the acts, nor to censure the persons, in such cases you\r\nhave taken the explanatory mode, and, without condemning what is done,\r\nyou direct the future judgment of the court.\r\n\r\nAll bills for the reformation of the law must be according to the subject-\r\nmatter, the circumstances, and the occasion, and are of four kinds:--1.\r\nEither the law is totally wanting, and then a new enacting statute must\r\nbe made to supply that want; or, 2.  It is defective, then a new law must\r\nbe made to enforce it. 3.  Or it is opposed by power or fraud, and then\r\nan act must be made to declare it. 4  Or it is rendered doubtful and\r\ncontroverted, and then a law must be made to explain it.  These must be\r\napplied according to the exigence of the case; one is just as good as\r\nanother of them.  Miserable, indeed, would be the resources, poor and\r\nunfurnished the stores and magazines of legislation, if we were bound up\r\nto a little narrow form, and not able to frame our acts of parliament\r\naccording to every disposition of our own minds, and to every possible\r\nemergency of the commonwealth; to make them declaratory, enforcing,\r\nexplanatory, repealing, just in what mode, or in what degree we please.\r\n\r\nThose who think that the judges, living and dead, are to be condemned,\r\nthat your tribunals of justice are to be dishonoured, that their acts and\r\njudgments on this business are to be rescinded, they will undoubtedly\r\nvote against this bill, and for another sort.\r\n\r\nI am not of the opinion of those gentlemen who are against disturbing the\r\npublic repose; I like a clamour whenever there is an abuse.  The fire-\r\nbell at midnight disturbs your sleep, but it keeps you from being burned\r\nin your bed.  The hue and cry alarms the county, but it preserves all the\r\nproperty of the province.  All these clamours aim at redress.  But a\r\nclamour made merely for the purpose of rendering the people discontented\r\nwith their situation, without an endeavour to give them a practical\r\nremedy, is indeed one of the worst acts of sedition.\r\n\r\nI have read and heard much upon the conduct of our courts in the business\r\nof libels.  I was extremely willing to enter into, and very free to act\r\nas facts should turn out on that inquiry, aiming constantly at remedy as\r\nthe end of all clamour, all debate, all writing, and all inquiry; for\r\nwhich reason I did embrace, and do now with joy, this method of giving\r\nquiet to the courts, jurisdiction to juries, liberty to the press, and\r\nsatisfaction to the people.  I thank my friends for what they have done;\r\nI hope the public will one day reap the benefit of their pious and\r\njudicious endeavours.  They have now sown the seed; I hope they will live\r\nto see the flourishing harvest.  Their bill is sown in weakness; it will,\r\nI trust, be reaped in power; and then, however, we shall have reason to\r\napply to them what my Lord Coke says was an aphorism continually in the\r\nmouth of a great sage of the law, \"Blessed be not the complaining tongue,\r\nbut blessed be the amending hand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON A BILL FOR SHORTENING THE DURATION OF PARLIAMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is always to be lamented when men are driven to search into the\r\nfoundations of the commonwealth.  It is certainly necessary to resort to\r\nthe theory of your government whenever you propose any alteration in the\r\nframe of it, whether that alteration means the revival of some former\r\nantiquated and forsaken constitution of state, or the introduction of\r\nsome new improvement in the commonwealth.  The object of our deliberation\r\nis, to promote the good purposes for which elections have been\r\ninstituted, and to prevent their inconveniences.  If we thought frequent\r\nelections attended with no inconvenience, or with but a trifling\r\ninconvenience, the strong overruling principle of the Constitution would\r\nsweep us like a torrent towards them.  But your remedy is to be suited to\r\nyour disease--your present disease, and to your whole disease.  That man\r\nthinks much too highly, and therefore he thinks weakly and delusively, of\r\nany contrivance of human wisdom, who believes that it can make any sort\r\nof approach to perfection.  There is not, there never was, a principle of\r\ngovernment under heaven, that does not, in the very pursuit of the good\r\nit proposes, naturally and inevitably lead into some inconvenience, which\r\nmakes it absolutely necessary to counterwork and weaken the application\r\nof that first principle itself; and to abandon something of the extent of\r\nthe advantage you proposed by it, in order to prevent also the\r\ninconveniences which have arisen from the instrument of all the good you\r\nhad in view.\r\n\r\nTo govern according to the sense and agreeably to the interests of the\r\npeople is a great and glorious object of government.  This object cannot\r\nbe obtained but through the medium of popular election, and popular\r\nelection is a mighty evil.  It is such, and so great an evil, that though\r\nthere are few nations whose monarchs were not originally elective, very\r\nfew are now elected.  They are the distempers of elections, that have\r\ndestroyed all free states.  To cure these distempers is difficult, if not\r\nimpossible; the only thing therefore left to save the commonwealth is to\r\nprevent their return too frequently.  The objects in view are, to have\r\nparliaments as frequent as they can be without distracting them in the\r\nprosecution of public business; on one hand, to secure their dependence\r\nupon the people, on the other to give them that quiet in their minds, and\r\nthat ease in their fortunes, as to enable them to perform the most\r\narduous and most painful duty in the world with spirit, with efficiency,\r\nwith independency, and with experience, as real public counsellors, not\r\nas the canvassers at a perpetual election.  It is wise to compass as many\r\ngood ends as possibly you can, and seeing there are inconveniences on\r\nboth sides, with benefits on both, to give up a part of the benefit to\r\nsoften the inconvenience.  The perfect cure is impracticable, because the\r\ndisorder is dear to those from whom alone the cure can possibly be\r\nderived.  The utmost to be done is to palliate, to mitigate, to respite,\r\nto put off the evil day of the Constitution to its latest possible hour,\r\nand may it be a very late one!\r\n\r\nThis bill, I fear, would precipitate one of two consequences, I know not\r\nwhich most likely, or which most dangerous: either that the Crown by its\r\nconstant stated power, influence, and revenue, would wear out all\r\nopposition in elections, or that a violent and furious popular spirit\r\nwould arise.  I must see, to satisfy me, the remedies; I must see, from\r\ntheir operation in the cure of the old evil, and in the cure of those new\r\nevils, which are inseparable from all remedies, how they balance each\r\nother, and what is the total result.  The excellence of mathematics and\r\nmetaphysics is to have but one thing before you, but he forms the best\r\njudgment in all moral disquisitions, who has the greatest number and\r\nvariety of considerations, in one view before him, and can take them in\r\nwith the best possible consideration of the middle results of all.\r\n\r\nWe of the opposition, who are not friends to the bill, give this pledge\r\nat least of our integrity and sincerity to the people, that in our\r\nsituation of systematic opposition to the present ministers, in which all\r\nour hope of rendering it effectual depends upon popular interest and\r\nfavour, we will not flatter them by a surrender of our uninfluenced\r\njudgment and opinion; we give a security, that if ever we should be in\r\nanother situation, no flattery to any other sort of power and influence\r\nwould induce us to act against the true interests of the people.\r\n\r\nAll are agreed that parliaments should not be perpetual; the only\r\nquestion is, what is the most convenient time for their duration?  On\r\nwhich there are three opinions.  We are agreed, too, that the term ought\r\nnot to be chosen most likely in its operation to spread corruption, and\r\nto augment the already overgrown influence of the crown.  On these\r\nprinciples I mean to debate the question.  It is easy to pretend a zeal\r\nfor liberty.  Those who think themselves not likely to be encumbered with\r\nthe performance of their promises, either from their known inability, or\r\ntotal indifference about the performance, never fail to entertain the\r\nmost lofty ideas.  They are certainly the most specious, and they cost\r\nthem neither reflection to frame, nor pains to modify, nor management to\r\nsupport.  The task is of another nature to those who mean to promise\r\nnothing that it is not in their intentions, or may possibly be in their\r\npower to perform; to those who are bound and principled no more to delude\r\nthe understandings than to violate the liberty of their fellow-subjects.\r\nFaithful watchmen we ought to be over the rights and privileges of the\r\npeople.  But our duty, if we are qualified for it as we ought, is to give\r\nthem information, and not to receive it from them; we are not to go to\r\nschool to them to learn the principles of law and government.  In doing\r\nso we should not dutifully serve, but we should basely and scandalously\r\nbetray, the people, who are not capable of this service by nature, nor in\r\nany instance called to it by the Constitution.  I reverentially look up\r\nto the opinion of the people, and with an awe that is almost\r\nsuperstitious.  I should be ashamed to show my face before them, if I\r\nchanged my ground, as they cried up or cried down men, or things, or\r\nopinions; if I wavered and shifted about with every change, and joined in\r\nit, or opposed, as best answered any low interest or passion; if I held\r\nthem up hopes, which I knew I never intended, or promised what I well\r\nknew I could not perform.  Of all these things they are perfect sovereign\r\njudges without appeal; but as to the detail of particular measures, or to\r\nany general schemes of policy, they have neither enough of speculation in\r\nthe closet, nor of experience in business, to decide upon it.  They can\r\nwell see whether we are tools of a court, or their honest servants.  Of\r\nthat they can well judge; and I wish that they always exercised their\r\njudgment; but of the particular merits of a measure I have other\r\nstandards.  That the frequency of elections proposed by this bill has a\r\ntendency to increase the power and consideration of the electors, not\r\nlessen corruptibility, I do most readily allow; so far as it is\r\ndesirable, this is what it has; I will tell you now what it has not: 1st.\r\nIt has no sort of tendency to increase their integrity and public spirit,\r\nunless an increase of power has an operation upon voters in elections,\r\nthat it has in no other situation in the world, and upon no other part of\r\nmankind. 2nd.  This bill has no tendency to limit the quantity of\r\ninfluence in the Crown, to render its operation more difficult, or to\r\ncounteract that operation, which it cannot prevent, in any way\r\nwhatsoever.  It has its full weight, its full range, and its uncontrolled\r\noperation on the electors exactly as it had before. 3rd.  Nor, thirdly,\r\ndoes it abate the interest or inclination of Ministers to apply that\r\ninfluence to the electors: on the contrary, it renders it much more\r\nnecessary to them, if they seek to have a majority in parliament, to\r\nincrease the means of that influence, and redouble their diligence, and\r\nto sharpen dexterity in the application.  The whole effect of the bill is\r\ntherefore the removing the application of some part of the influence from\r\nthe elected to the electors, and further to strengthen and extend a court\r\ninterest already great and powerful in boroughs; here to fix their\r\nmagazines and places of arms, and thus to make them the principal, not\r\nthe secondary, theatre of their manoeuvres for securing a determined\r\nmajority in parliament.\r\n\r\nI believe nobody will deny that the electors are corruptible.  They are\r\nmen; it is saying nothing worse of them; many of them are but\r\nill-informed in their minds, many feeble in their circumstances, easily\r\nover-reached, easily seduced.  If they are many, the wages of corruption\r\nare the lower; and would to God it were not rather a contemptible and\r\nhypocritical adulation than a charitable sentiment, to say that there is\r\nalready no debauchery, no corruption, no bribery, no perjury, no blind\r\nfury, and interested faction among the electors in many parts of this\r\nkingdom: nor is it surprising, or at all blamable, in that class of\r\nprivate men, when they see their neighbours aggrandised, and themselves\r\npoor and virtuous, without that _eclat_ or dignity which attends men in\r\nhigher stations.\r\n\r\nBut admit it were true that the great mass of the electors were too vast\r\nan object for court influence to grasp, or extend to, and that in despair\r\nthey must abandon it; he must be very ignorant of the state of every\r\npopular interest, who does not know that in all the corporations, all the\r\nopen boroughs--indeed, in every district of the kingdom--there is some\r\nleading man, some agitator, some wealthy merchant, or considerable\r\nmanufacturer, some active attorney, some popular preacher, some money-\r\nlender, &c., &c., who is followed by the whole flock.  This is the style\r\nof all free countries.\r\n\r\n   --Multum in Fabia valet hic, valet ille Velina;\r\n   Cuilibet hic fasces dabit eripietque curule.\r\n\r\nThese spirits, each of which informs and governs his own little orb, are\r\nneither so many, nor so little powerful, nor so incorruptible, but that a\r\nMinister may, as he does frequently, find means of gaining them, and\r\nthrough them all their followers.  To establish, therefore, a very\r\ngeneral influence among electors will no more be found an impracticable\r\nproject, than to gain an undue influence over members of parliament.\r\nTherefore I am apprehensive that this bill, though it shifts the place of\r\nthe disorder, does by no means relieve the Constitution.  I went through\r\nalmost every contested election in the beginning of this parliament, and\r\nacted as a manager in very many of them: by which, though at a school of\r\npretty severe and ragged discipline, I came to have some degree of\r\ninstruction concerning the means by which parliamentary interests are in\r\ngeneral procured and supported.\r\n\r\nTheory, I know, would suppose, that every general election is to the\r\nrepresentative a day of judgment, in which he appears before his\r\nconstituents to account for the use of the talent with which they\r\nentrusted him, and of the improvement he had made of it for the public\r\nadvantage.  It would be so, if every corruptible representative were to\r\nfind an enlightened and incorruptible constituent.  But the practice and\r\nknowledge of the world will not suffer us to be ignorant, that the\r\nConstitution on paper is one thing, and in fact and experience is\r\nanother.  We must know that the candidate, instead of trusting at his\r\nelection to the testimony of his behaviour in parliament, must bring the\r\ntestimony of a large sum of money, the capacity of liberal expense in\r\nentertainments, the power of serving and obliging the rulers of\r\ncorporations, of winning over the popular leaders of political clubs,\r\nassociations, and neighbourhoods.  It is ten thousand times more\r\nnecessary to show himself a man of power, than a man of integrity, in\r\nalmost all the elections with which I have been acquainted.  Elections,\r\ntherefore, become a matter of heavy expense; and if contests are\r\nfrequent, to many they will become a matter of an expense totally\r\nruinous, which no fortunes can bear; but least of all the landed\r\nfortunes, encumbered as they often, indeed as they mostly are, with\r\ndebts, with portions, with jointures; and tied up in the hands of the\r\npossessor by the limitations of settlement.  It is a material, it is in\r\nmy opinion a lasting, consideration, in all the questions concerning\r\nelection.  Let no one think the charges of election a trivial matter.\r\n\r\nThe charge, therefore, of elections ought never to be lost sight of, in a\r\nquestion concerning their frequency, because the grand object you seek is\r\nindependence.  Independence of mind will ever be more or less influenced\r\nby independence of fortune; and if, every three years, the exhausting\r\nsluices of entertainments, drinkings, open houses, to say nothing of\r\nbribery, are to be periodically drawn up and renewed--if government\r\nfavours, for which now, in some shape or other, the whole race of men are\r\ncandidates, are to be called for upon every occasion, I see that private\r\nfortunes will be washed away, and every, even to the least, trace of\r\nindependence, borne down by the torrent.  I do not seriously think this\r\nConstitution, even to the wrecks of it, could survive five triennial\r\nelections.  If you are to fight the battle, you must put on the armour of\r\nthe Ministry; you must call in the public, to the aid of private, money.\r\nThe expense of the last election has been computed (and I am persuaded\r\nthat it has not been overrated) at 1,500,000 pounds; three shillings in\r\nthe pound more on the Land Tax.  About the close of the last Parliament,\r\nand the beginning of this, several agents for boroughs went about, and I\r\nremember well that it was in every one of their mouths--\"Sir, your\r\nelection will cost you three thousand pounds, if you are independent; but\r\nif the Ministry supports you, it may be done for two, and perhaps for\r\nless;\" and, indeed, the thing spoke itself.  Where a living was to be got\r\nfor one, a commission in the army for another, a post in the navy for a\r\nthird, and Custom-house offices scattered about without measure or\r\nnumber, who doubts but money may be saved?  The Treasury may even add\r\nmoney; but, indeed, it is superfluous.  A gentleman of two thousand a\r\nyear, who meets another of the same fortune, fights with equal arms; but\r\nif to one of the candidates you add a thousand a year in places for\r\nhimself, and a power of giving away as much among others, one must, or\r\nthere is no truth in arithmetical demonstration, ruin his adversary, if\r\nhe is to meet him and to fight with him every third year.  It will be\r\nsaid, I do not allow for the operation of character; but I do; and I know\r\nit will have its weight in most elections; perhaps it may be decisive in\r\nsome.  But there are few in which it will prevent great expenses.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of independent fortunes will be the consequence on the\r\npart of the candidate.  What will be the consequence of triennial\r\ncorruption, triennial drunkenness, triennial idleness, triennial\r\nlaw-suits, litigations, prosecutions, triennial frenzy; of society\r\ndissolved, industry interrupted, ruined; of those personal hatreds that\r\nwill never be suffered to soften; those animosities and feuds, which will\r\nbe rendered immortal; those quarrels, which are never to be appeased;\r\nmorals vitiated and gangrened to the vitals?  I think no stable and\r\nuseful advantages were ever made by the money got at elections by the\r\nvoter, but all he gets is doubly lost to the public; it is money given to\r\ndiminish the general stock of the community, which is the industry of the\r\nsubject.  I am sure that it is a good while before he or his family\r\nsettle again to their business.  Their heads will never cool; the\r\ntemptations of elections will be for ever glittering before their eyes.\r\nThey will all grow politicians; every one, quitting his business, will\r\nchoose to enrich himself by his vote.  They will take the gauging-rod;\r\nnew places will be made for them; they will run to the Custom-house quay,\r\ntheir looms and ploughs will be deserted.\r\n\r\nSo was Rome destroyed by the disorders of continual elections, though\r\nthose of Rome were sober disorders.  They had nothing but faction,\r\nbribery, bread, and stage plays to debauch them.  We have the\r\ninflammation of liquor superadded, a fury hotter than any of them.  There\r\nthe contest was only between citizen and citizen; here you have the\r\ncontests of ambitious citizens on one side, supported by the Crown, to\r\noppose to the efforts (let it be so) of private and unsupported ambition\r\non the other.  Yet Rome was destroyed by the frequency and charge of\r\nelections, and the monstrous expense of an unremitted courtship to the\r\npeople.  I think, therefore, the independent candidate and elector may\r\neach be destroyed by it, the whole body of the community be an infinite\r\nsufferer, and a vicious Ministry the only gainer.  Gentlemen, I know,\r\nfeel the weight of this argument; they agree that this would be the\r\nconsequence of more frequent elections, if things were to continue as\r\nthey are.  But they think the greatness and frequency of the evil would\r\nitself be a remedy for it; that, sitting but for a short time, the member\r\nwould not find it worth while to make such vast expenses, while the fear\r\nof their constituents will hold them the more effectually to their duty.\r\n\r\nTo this I answer, that experience is full against them.  This is no new\r\nthing; we have had triennial parliaments; at no period of time were seats\r\nmore eagerly contested.  The expenses of elections ran higher, taking the\r\nstate of all charges, than they do now.  The expense of entertainments\r\nwas such, that an Act, equally severe and ineffectual, was made against\r\nit; every monument of the time bears witness of the expense, and most of\r\nthe Acts against corruption in elections were then made; all the writers\r\ntalked of it and lamented it.  Will any one think that a corporation will\r\nbe contented with a bowl of punch, or a piece of beef the less, because\r\nelections are every three, instead of every seven years?  Will they\r\nchange their wine for ale, because they are to get more ale three years\r\nhence?  Do not think it.  Will they make fewer demands for the advantages\r\nof patronage in favours and offices, because their member is brought more\r\nunder their power?  We have not only our own historical experience in\r\nEngland upon this subject, but we have the experience co-existing with us\r\nin Ireland, where, since their Parliament has been shortened, the expense\r\nof elections has been so far from being lowered that it has been very\r\nnear doubled.  Formerly they sat for the king's life; the ordinary charge\r\nof a seat in Parliament was then 1,500 pounds.  They now sit eight years,\r\nfour sessions: it is now 2,500 pounds and upwards.  The spirit of\r\nemulation has also been extremely increased, and all who are acquainted\r\nwith the tone of that country have no doubt that the spirit is still\r\ngrowing, that new candidates will take the field, that the contests will\r\nbe more violent, and the expenses of elections larger than ever.\r\n\r\nIt never can be otherwise.  A seat in this House, for good purposes, for\r\nbad purposes, for no purpose at all (except the mere consideration\r\nderived from being concerned in the public councils) will ever be a first-\r\nrate object of ambition in England.  Ambition is no exact calculator.\r\nAvarice itself does not calculate strictly when it games.  One thing is\r\ncertain, that in this political game the great lottery of power is that\r\ninto which men will purchase with millions of chances against them.  In\r\nTurkey, where the place, where the fortune, where the head itself, are so\r\ninsecure, that scarcely any have died in their beds for ages, so that the\r\nbowstring is the natural death of Bashaws, yet in no country is power and\r\ndistinction (precarious enough, God knows, in all) sought for with such\r\nboundless avidity, as if the value of place was enhanced by the danger\r\nand insecurity of its tenure.  Nothing will ever make a seat in this\r\nHouse not an object of desire to numbers by any means or at any charge,\r\nbut the depriving it of all power and all dignity.  This would do it.\r\nThis is the true and only nostrum for that purpose.  But a House of\r\nCommons without power and without dignity, either in itself or its\r\nmembers, is no House of Commons for the purposes of this Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut they will be afraid to act ill, if they know that the day of their\r\naccount is always near.  I wish it were true, but it is not; here again\r\nwe have experience, and experience is against us.  The distemper of this\r\nage is a poverty of spirit and of genius; it is trifling, it is futile,\r\nworse than ignorant, superficially taught, with the politics and morals\r\nof girls at a boarding-school, rather than of men and statesmen; but it\r\nis not yet desperately wicked, or so scandalously venal as in former\r\ntimes.  Did not a triennial parliament give up the national dignity,\r\napprove the Peace of Utrecht, and almost give up everything else in\r\ntaking every step to defeat the Protestant succession?  Was not the\r\nConstitution saved by those who had no election at all to go to, the\r\nLords, because the Court applied to electors, and by various means\r\ncarried them from their true interests; so that the Tory Ministry had a\r\nmajority without an application to a single member?  Now, as to the\r\nconduct of the members, it was then far from pure and independent.\r\nBribery was infinitely more flagrant.  A predecessor of yours, Mr.\r\nSpeaker, put the question of his own expulsion for bribery.  Sir William\r\nMusgrave was a wise man, a grave man, an independent man, a man of good\r\nfortune and good family; however, he carried on while in opposition a\r\ntraffic, a shameful traffic with the Ministry.  Bishop Burnet knew of\r\n6,000 pounds which he had received at one payment.  I believe the payment\r\nof sums in hard money--plain, naked bribery--is rare amongst us.  It was\r\nthen far from uncommon.\r\n\r\nA triennial was near ruining, a septennial parliament saved, your\r\nConstitution; nor perhaps have you ever known a more flourishing period\r\nfor the union of national prosperity, dignity, and liberty, than the\r\nsixty years you have passed under that Constitution of parliament.\r\n\r\nThe shortness of time, in which they are to reap the profits of iniquity,\r\nis far from checking the avidity of corrupt men; it renders them\r\ninfinitely more ravenous.  They rush violently and precipitately on their\r\nobject, they lose all regard to decorum.  The moments of profit are\r\nprecious; never are men so wicked as during a general mortality.  It was\r\nso in the great plague at Athens, every symptom of which (and this its\r\nworst amongst the rest) is so finely related by a great historian of\r\nantiquity.  It was so in the plague of London in 1665.  It appears in\r\nsoldiers, sailors, &c.  Whoever would contrive to render the life of man\r\nmuch shorter than it is, would, I am satisfied, find the surest recipe\r\nfor increasing the wickedness of our nature.\r\n\r\nThus, in my opinion, the shortness of a triennial sitting would have the\r\nfollowing ill effects:--It would make the member more shamelessly and\r\nshockingly corrupt, it would increase his dependence on those who could\r\nbest support him at his election, it would wrack and tear to pieces the\r\nfortunes of those who stood upon their own fortunes and their private\r\ninterest, it would make the electors infinitely more venal, and it would\r\nmake the whole body of the people, who are, whether they have votes or\r\nnot, concerned in elections, more lawless, more idle, more debauched; it\r\nwould utterly destroy the sobriety, the industry, the integrity, the\r\nsimplicity of all the people, and undermine, I am much afraid, the\r\ndeepest and best laid foundations of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nThose who have spoken and written upon this subject without doors, do not\r\nso much deny the probable existence of these inconveniences in their\r\nmeasure, as they trust for the prevention to remedies of various sorts,\r\nwhich they propose.  First, a place bill; but if this will not do, as\r\nthey fear it will not, then, they say, we will have a rotation, and a\r\ncertain number of you shall be rendered incapable of being elected for\r\nten years.  Then, for the electors, they shall ballot; the members of\r\nparliament also shall decide by ballot; and a fifth project is the change\r\nof the present legal representation of the kingdom.  On all this I shall\r\nobserve, that it will be very unsuitable to your wisdom to adopt the\r\nproject of a bill, to which there are objections insuperable by anything\r\nin the bill itself, upon the hope that those objections may be removed by\r\nsubsequent projects; every one of which is full of difficulties of its\r\nown, and which are all of them very essential alterations in the\r\nConstitution.  This seems very irregular and unusual.  If anything should\r\nmake this a very doubtful measure, what can make it more so than that, in\r\nthe opinion of its advocates, it would aggravate all our old\r\ninconveniences in such a manner as to require a total alteration in the\r\nConstitution of the kingdom?  If the remedies are proper in a triennial,\r\nthey will not be less so in septennial elections; let us try them first,\r\nsee how the House relishes them, see how they will operate in the nation;\r\nand then, having felt your way, you will be prepared against these\r\ninconveniences.\r\n\r\nThe honourable gentleman sees that I respect the principle upon which he\r\ngoes, as well as his intentions and his abilities.  He will believe that\r\nI do not differ from him wantonly, and on trivial grounds.  He is very\r\nsure that it was not his embracing one way which determined me to take\r\nthe other.  I have not, in newspapers, to derogate from his fair fame\r\nwith the nation, printed the first rude sketch of his bill with\r\nungenerous and invidious comments.  I have not, in conversations\r\nindustriously circulated about the town, and talked on the benches of\r\nthis House, attributed his conduct to motives low and unworthy, and as\r\ngroundless as they are injurious.  I do not affect to be frightened with\r\nthis proposition, as if some hideous spectre had started from hell, which\r\nwas to be sent back again by every form of exorcism, and every kind of\r\nincantation.  I invoke no Acheron to overwhelm him in the whirlpools of\r\nhis muddy gulf.  I do not tell the respectable mover and seconder, by a\r\nperversion of their sense and expressions, that their proposition halts\r\nbetween the ridiculous and the dangerous.  I am not one of those who\r\nstart up three at a time, and fall upon and strike at him with so much\r\neagerness, that our daggers hack one another in his sides.  My honourable\r\nfriend has not brought down a spirited imp of chivalry, to win the first\r\nachievement and blazon of arms on his milk-white shield in a field listed\r\nagainst him, nor brought out the generous offspring of lions, and said to\r\nthem, \"Not against that side of the forest, beware of that--here is the\r\nprey where you are to fasten your paws;\" and seasoning his unpractised\r\njaws with blood, tell him, \"This is the milk for which you are to thirst\r\nhereafter.\"  We furnish at his expense no holiday, nor suspend hell that\r\na crafty Ixion may have rest from his wheel; nor give the common\r\nadversary, if he be a common adversary, reason to say, \"I would have put\r\nin my word to oppose, but the eagerness of your allies in your social war\r\nwas such that I could not break in upon you.\"  I hope he sees and feels,\r\nand that every member sees and feels along with him, the difference\r\nbetween amicable dissent and civil discord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPEECH ON REFORM OF REPRESENTATION IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS\r\nJUNE, 1784\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker,--We have now discovered, at the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, that the Constitution of England, which for a series of ages had\r\nbeen the proud distinction of this country, always the admiration, and\r\nsometimes the envy, of the wise and learned in every other nation--we\r\nhave discovered that this boasted Constitution, in the most boasted part\r\nof it, is a gross imposition upon the understanding of mankind, an insult\r\nto their feelings, and acting by contrivances destructive to the best and\r\nmost valuable interests of the people.  Our political architects have\r\ntaken a survey of the fabric of the British Constitution.  It is singular\r\nthat they report nothing against the Crown, nothing against the Lords;\r\nbut in the House of Commons everything is unsound; it is ruinous in every\r\npart.  It is infested by the dry rot, and ready to tumble about our ears\r\nwithout their immediate help.  You know by the faults they find what are\r\ntheir ideas of the alteration.  As all government stands upon opinion,\r\nthey know that the way utterly to destroy it is to remove that opinion,\r\nto take away all reverence, all confidence from it; and then, at the\r\nfirst blast of public discontent and popular tumult, it tumbles to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIn considering this question, they who oppose it, oppose it on different\r\ngrounds; one is in the nature of a previous question--that some\r\nalterations may be expedient, but that this is not the time for making\r\nthem.  The other is, that no essential alterations are at all wanting,\r\nand that neither now, nor at any time, is it prudent or safe to be\r\nmeddling with the fundamental principles and ancient tried usages of our\r\nConstitution--that our representation is as nearly perfect as the\r\nnecessary imperfection of human affairs and of human creatures will\r\nsuffer it to be; and that it is a subject of prudent and honest use and\r\nthankful enjoyment, and not of captious criticism and rash experiment.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, there are two parties, who proceed on two grounds--in\r\nmy opinion, as they state them, utterly irreconcilable.  The one is\r\njuridical, the other political.  The one is in the nature of a claim of\r\nright, on the supposed rights of man as man; this party desire the\r\ndecision of a suit.  The other ground, as far as I can divine what it\r\ndirectly means, is, that the representation is not so politically framed\r\nas to answer the theory of its institution.  As to the claim of right,\r\nthe meanest petitioner, the most gross and ignorant, is as good as the\r\nbest; in some respects his claim is more favourable on account of his\r\nignorance; his weakness, his poverty and distress only add to his titles;\r\nhe sues _in forma pauperis_: he ought to be a favourite of the Court.  But\r\nwhen the other ground is taken, when the question is political, when a\r\nnew Constitution is to be made on a sound theory of government, then the\r\npresumptuous pride of didactic ignorance is to be excluded from the\r\ncouncil in this high and arduous matter, which often bids defiance to the\r\nexperience of the wisest.  The first claims a personal representation;\r\nthe latter rejects it with scorn and fervour.  The language of the first\r\nparty is plain and intelligible; they who plead an absolute right, cannot\r\nbe satisfied with anything short of personal representation, because all\r\nnatural rights must be the rights of individuals: as by nature there is\r\nno such thing as politic or corporate personality; all these ideas are\r\nmere fictions of law, they are creatures of voluntary institution; men as\r\nmen are individuals, and nothing else.  They, therefore, who reject the\r\nprinciple of natural and personal representation, are essentially and\r\neternally at variance with those who claim it.  As to the first sort of\r\nreformers, it is ridiculous to talk to them of the British Constitution\r\nupon any or all of its bases; for they lay it down, that every man ought\r\nto govern himself, and that where he cannot go himself he must send his\r\nrepresentative; that all other government is usurpation, and is so far\r\nfrom having a claim to our obedience, that it is not only our right, but\r\nour duty, to resist it.  Nine-tenths of the reformers argue thus--that\r\nis, on the natural right.  It is impossible not to make some reflection\r\non the nature of this claim, or avoid a comparison between the extent of\r\nthe principle and the present object of the demand.  If this claim be\r\nfounded, it is clear to what it goes.  The House of Commons, in that\r\nlight, undoubtedly is no representative of the people as a collection of\r\nindividuals.  Nobody pretends it, nobody can justify such an assertion.\r\nWhen you come to examine into this claim of right, founded on the right\r\nof self-government in each individual, you find the thing demanded\r\ninfinitely short of the principle of the demand.  What! one-third only of\r\nthe legislature, of the government no share at all?  What sort of treaty\r\nof partition is this for those who have no inherent right to the whole?\r\nGive them all they ask, and your grant is still a cheat; for how comes\r\nonly a third to be their younger children's fortune in this settlement?\r\nHow came they neither to have the choice of kings, or lords, or judges,\r\nor generals, or admirals, or bishops, or priests, or ministers, or\r\njustices of peace?  Why, what have you to answer in favour of the prior\r\nrights of the Crown and peerage but this--our Constitution is a\r\nproscriptive Constitution; it is a Constitution whose sole authority is,\r\nthat it has existed time out of mind.  It is settled in these two\r\nportions against one, legislatively; and in the whole of the judicature,\r\nthe whole of the federal capacity, of the executive, the prudential and\r\nthe financial administration, in one alone.  Nor were your House of Lords\r\nand the prerogatives of the Crown settled on any adjudication in favour\r\nof natural rights, for they could never be so portioned.  Your king, your\r\nlords, your judges, your juries, grand and little, all are prescriptive;\r\nand what proves it is the disputes not yet concluded, and never near\r\nbecoming so, when any of them first originated.  Prescription is the most\r\nsolid of all titles, not only to property, but, which is to secure that\r\nproperty, to government.  They harmonise with each other, and give mutual\r\naid to one another.  It is accompanied with another ground of authority\r\nin the constitution of the human mind--presumption.  It is a presumption\r\nin favour of any settled scheme of government against any untried\r\nproject, that a nation has long existed and flourished under it.  It is a\r\nbetter presumption even of the choice of a nation, far better than any\r\nsudden and temporary arrangement by actual election.  Because a nation is\r\nnot an idea only of local extent, and individual momentary aggregation,\r\nbut it is an idea of continuity, which extends in time as well as in\r\nnumbers and in space.  And this is a choice not of one day, or one set of\r\npeople, not a tumultuary and giddy choice; it is a deliberate election of\r\nages and of generations; it is a Constitution made by what is ten\r\nthousand times better than choice--it is made by the peculiar\r\ncircumstances, occasions, tempers, dispositions, and moral, civil, and\r\nsocial habitudes of the people, which disclose themselves only in a long\r\nspace of time.  It is a vestment, which accommodates itself to the body.\r\nNor is prescription of government formed upon blind, unmeaning\r\nprejudices--for man is a most unwise, and a most wise being.  The\r\nindividual is foolish.  The multitude, for the moment, are foolish, when\r\nthey act without deliberation; but the species is wise, and when time is\r\ngiven to it, as a species it almost always acts right.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the Crown as it is, for the Lords as they are, is my\r\nreason for the Commons as they are, the electors as they are.  Now, if\r\nthe Crown and the Lords, and the judicatures, are all prescriptive, so is\r\nthe House of Commons of the very same origin, and of no other.  We and\r\nour electors have powers and privileges both made and circumscribed by\r\nprescription, as much to the full as the other parts; and as such we have\r\nalways claimed them, and on no other title.  The House of Commons is a\r\nlegislative body corporate by prescription, not made upon any given\r\ntheory, but existing prescriptively--just like the rest.  This\r\nprescription has made it essentially what it is--an aggregate collection\r\nof three parts--knights, citizens, burgesses.  The question is, whether\r\nthis has been always so, since the House of Commons has taken its present\r\nshape and circumstances, and has been an essential operative part of the\r\nConstitution; which, I take it, it has been for at least five hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThis I resolve to myself in the affirmative: and then another question\r\narises; whether this House stands firm upon its ancient foundations, and\r\nis not, by time and accidents, so declined from its perpendicular as to\r\nwant the hand of the wise and experienced architects of the day to set it\r\nupright again, and to prop and buttress it up for duration;--whether it\r\ncontinues true to the principles upon which it has hitherto\r\nstood;--whether this be _de facto_ the Constitution of the House of\r\nCommons as it has been since the time that the House of Commons has,\r\nwithout dispute, become a necessary and an efficient part of the British\r\nConstitution?  To ask whether a thing, which has always been the same,\r\nstands to its usual principle, seems to me to be perfectly absurd; for\r\nhow do you know the principles but from the construction? and if that\r\nremains the same, the principles remain the same.  It is true, that to\r\nsay your Constitution is what it has been, is no sufficient defence for\r\nthose who say it is a bad Constitution.  It is an answer to those who say\r\nthat it is a degenerate Constitution.  To those who say it is a bad one,\r\nI answer, Look to its effects.  In all moral machinery the moral results\r\nare its test.\r\n\r\nOn what grounds do we go to restore our Constitution to what it has been\r\nat some given period, or to reform and reconstruct it upon principles\r\nmore conformable to a sound theory of government?  A prescriptive\r\ngovernment, such as ours, never was the work of any legislator, never was\r\nmade upon any foregone theory.  It seems to me a preposterous way of\r\nreasoning, and a perfect confusion of ideas, to take the theories, which\r\nlearned and speculative men have made from that government, and then,\r\nsupposing it made on these theories, which were made from it, to accuse\r\nthe government as not corresponding with them.  I do not vilify theory\r\nand speculation--no, because that would be to vilify reason itself.\r\n\"_Neque decipitur ratio_, _neque decipit unquam_.\"  No; whenever I speak\r\nagainst theory, I mean always a weak, erroneous, fallacious, unfounded,\r\nor imperfect theory; and one of the ways of discovering that it is a\r\nfalse theory is by comparing it with practice.  This is the true\r\ntouchstone of all theories which regard man and the affairs of men: Does\r\nit suit his nature in general?--does it suit his nature as modified by\r\nhis habits?\r\n\r\nThe more frequently this affair is discussed, the stronger the case\r\nappears to the sense and the feelings of mankind.  I have no more doubt\r\nthan I entertain of my existence, that this very thing, which is stated\r\nas a horrible thing, is the means of the preservation of our Constitution\r\nwhilst it lasts: of curing it of many of the disorders which, attending\r\nevery species of institution, would attend the principle of an exact\r\nlocal representation, or a representation on the principle of numbers.  If\r\nyou reject personal representation, you are pushed upon expedience; and\r\nthen what they wish us to do is, to prefer their speculations on that\r\nsubject to the happy experience of this country of a growing liberty and\r\na growing prosperity for five hundred years.  Whatever respect I have for\r\ntheir talents, this, for one, I will not do.  Then what is the standard\r\nof expedience?  Expedience is that which is good for the community, and\r\ngood for every individual in it.  Now this expedience is the\r\n_desideratum_ to be sought, either without the experience of means, or\r\nwith that experience.  If without, as in the case of the fabrication of a\r\nnew commonwealth, I will hear the learned arguing what promises to be\r\nexpedient; but if we are to judge of a commonwealth actually existing,\r\nthe first thing I inquire is, What has been found expedient or\r\ninexpedient?  And I will not take their promise rather than the\r\nperformance of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nBut no; this was not the cause of the discontents.  I went through most\r\nof the northern parts--the Yorkshire election was then raging; the year\r\nbefore, through most of the western counties--Bath, Bristol,\r\nGloucester--not one word, either in the towns or country, on the subject\r\nof representation; much on the receipt tax, something on Mr. Fox's\r\nambition; much greater apprehension of danger from thence than from want\r\nof representation.  One would think that the ballast of the ship was\r\nshifted with us, and that our Constitution had the gunnel under water.\r\nBut can you fairly and distinctly point out what one evil or grievance\r\nhas happened, which you can refer to the representative not following the\r\nopinion of his constituents?  What one symptom do we find of this\r\ninequality?  But it is not an arithmetical inequality with which we ought\r\nto trouble ourselves.  If there be a moral, a political equality, this is\r\nthe _desideratum_ in our Constitution, and in every Constitution in the\r\nworld.  Moral inequality is as between places and between classes.  Now,\r\nI ask, what advantage do you find, that the places which abound in\r\nrepresentation possess over others in which it is more scanty, in\r\nsecurity for freedom, in security for justice, or in any one of those\r\nmeans of procuring temporal prosperity and eternal happiness, the ends\r\nfor which society was formed?  Are the local interests of Cornwall and\r\nWiltshire, for instance--their roads, canals, their prisons, their\r\npolice--better than Yorkshire, Warwickshire, or Staffordshire?  Warwick\r\nhas members; is Warwick or Stafford more opulent, happy, or free, than\r\nNewcastle or than Birmingham?  Is Wiltshire the pampered favourite,\r\nwhilst Yorkshire, like the child of the bondwoman, is turned out to the\r\ndesert?  This is like the unhappy persons who live, if they can be said\r\nto live, in the statical chair; who are ever feeling their pulse, and who\r\ndo not judge of health by the aptitude of the body to perform its\r\nfunctions, but by their ideas of what ought to be the true balance\r\nbetween the several secretions.  Is a committee of Cornwall, &c.,\r\nthronged, and the others deserted?  No.  You have an equal\r\nrepresentation, because you have men equally interested in the prosperity\r\nof the whole, who are involved in the general interest and the general\r\nsympathy; and perhaps these places, furnishing a superfluity of public\r\nagents and administrators (whether, in strictness, they are\r\nrepresentatives or not, I do not mean to inquire, but they are agents and\r\nadministrators), will stand clearer of local interests, passions,\r\nprejudices, and cabals than the others, and therefore preserve the\r\nbalance of the parts, and with a more general view and a more steady hand\r\nthan the rest.\r\n\r\nIn every political proposal we must not leave out of the question the\r\npolitical views and object of the proposer; and these we discover, not by\r\nwhat he says, but by the principles he lays down.  \"I mean,\" says he, \"a\r\nmoderate and temperate reform;\" that is, \"I mean to do as little good as\r\npossible.  If the Constitution be what you represent it, and there be no\r\ndanger in the change, you do wrong not to make the reform commensurate to\r\nthe abuse.\"  Fine reformer, indeed! generous donor!  What is the cause of\r\nthis parsimony of the liberty which you dole out to the people?  Why all\r\nthis limitation in giving blessings and benefits to mankind?  You admit\r\nthat there is an extreme in liberty, which may be infinitely noxious to\r\nthose who are to receive it, and which in the end will leave them no\r\nliberty at all.  I think so too; they know it, and they feel it.  The\r\nquestion is, then, What is the standard of that extreme?  What that\r\ngentleman, and the associations, or some parts of their phalanxes, think\r\nproper.  Then our liberties are in their pleasure; it depends on their\r\narbitrary will how far I shall be free.  I will have none of that\r\nfreedom.  If, therefore, the standard of moderation be sought for, I will\r\nseek for it.  Where?  Not in their fancies, nor in my own: I will seek\r\nfor it where I know it is to be found--in the Constitution I actually\r\nenjoy.  Here it says to an encroaching prerogative--\"Your sceptre has its\r\nlength; you cannot add a hair to your head, or a gem to your crown, but\r\nwhat an eternal law has given to it.\"  Here it says to an overweening\r\npeerage--\"Your pride finds banks that it cannot overflow;\" here to a\r\ntumultuous and giddy people--\"There is a bound to the raging of the sea.\"\r\nOur Constitution is like our island, which uses and restrains its subject\r\nsea; in vain the waves roar.  In that Constitution I know, and exultingly\r\nI feel, both that I am free and that I am not free dangerously to myself\r\nor to others.  I know that no power on earth, acting as I ought to do,\r\ncan touch my life, my liberty, or my property.  I have that inward and\r\ndignified consciousness of my own security and independence, which\r\nconstitutes, and is the only thing which does constitute, the proud and\r\ncomfortable sentiment of freedom in the human breast.  I know, too, and I\r\nbless God for my safe mediocrity; I know that if I possessed all the\r\ntalents of the gentlemen on the side of the House I sit, and on the\r\nother, I cannot, by royal favour, or by popular delusion, or by\r\noligarchical cabal, elevate myself above a certain very limited point, so\r\nas to endanger my own fall or the ruin of my country.  I know there is an\r\norder that keeps things fast in their place; it is made to us, and we are\r\nmade to it.  Why not ask another wife, other children, another body,\r\nanother mind?\r\n\r\nThe great object of most of these reformers is to prepare the destruction\r\nof the Constitution, by disgracing and discrediting the House of Commons.\r\nFor they think--prudently, in my opinion--that if they can persuade the\r\nnation that the House of Commons is so constituted as not to secure the\r\npublic liberty; not to have a proper connection with the public\r\ninterests; so constituted as not, either actually or virtually, to be the\r\nrepresentative of the people, it will be easy to prove that a government\r\ncomposed of a monarchy, an oligarchy chosen by the Crown, and such a\r\nHouse of Commons, whatever good can be in such a system, can by no means\r\nbe a system of free government.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution of England is never to have a quietus; it is to be\r\ncontinually vilified, attacked, reproached, resisted; instead of being\r\nthe hope and sure anchor in all storms, instead of being the means of\r\nredress to all grievances, itself is the grand grievance of the nation,\r\nour shame instead of our glory.  If the only specific plan\r\nproposed--individual, personal representation--is directly rejected by\r\nthe person who is looked on as the great support of this business, then\r\nthe only way of considering it is as a question of convenience.  An\r\nhonourable gentleman prefers the individual to the present.  He therefore\r\nhimself sees no middle term whatsoever, and therefore prefers of what he\r\nsees the individual; this is the only thing distinct and sensible that\r\nhas been advocated.  He has then a scheme, which is the individual\r\nrepresentation; he is not at a loss, not inconsistent--which scheme the\r\nother right honourable gentleman reprobates.  Now, what does this go to,\r\nbut to lead directly to anarchy?  For to discredit the only government\r\nwhich he either possesses or can project, what is this but to destroy all\r\ngovernment; and this is anarchy.  My right honourable friend, in\r\nsupporting this motion, disgraces his friends and justifies his enemies,\r\nin order to blacken the Constitution of his country, even of that House\r\nof Commons which supported him.  There is a difference between a moral or\r\npolitical exposure of a public evil, relative to the administration of\r\ngovernment, whether in men or systems, and a declaration of defects, real\r\nor supposed, in the fundamental Constitution of your country.  The first\r\nmay be cured in the individual by the motives of religion, virtue,\r\nhonour, fear, shame, or interest.  Men may be made to abandon, also,\r\nfalse systems by exposing their absurdity or mischievous tendency to\r\ntheir own better thoughts, or to the contempt or indignation of the\r\npublic; and after all, if they should exist, and exist uncorrected, they\r\nonly disgrace individuals as fugitive opinions.  But it is quite\r\notherwise with the frame and Constitution of the State; if that is\r\ndisgraced, patriotism is destroyed in its very source.  No man has ever\r\nwillingly obeyed, much less was desirous of defending with his blood, a\r\nmischievous and absurd scheme of government.  Our first, our dearest,\r\nmost comprehensive relation, our country, is gone.\r\n\r\nIt suggests melancholy reflections, in consequence of the strange course\r\nwe have long held, that we are now no longer quarrelling about the\r\ncharacter, or about the conduct of men, or the tenor of measures; but we\r\nare grown out of humour with the English Constitution itself; this is\r\nbecome the object of the animosity of Englishmen.  This Constitution in\r\nformer days used to be the admiration and the envy of the world; it was\r\nthe pattern for politicians; the theme of the eloquent; the meditation of\r\nthe philosopher in every part of the world.  As to Englishmen, it was\r\ntheir pride, their consolation.  By it they lived, for it they were ready\r\nto die.  Its defects, if it had any, were partly covered by partiality,\r\nand partly borne by prudence.  Now all its excellencies are forgotten,\r\nits faults are now forcibly dragged into day, exaggerated by every\r\nartifice of representation.  It is despised and rejected of men; and\r\nevery device and invention of ingenuity, or idleness, set up in\r\nopposition or in preference to it.  It is to this humour, and it is to\r\nthe measures growing out of it, that I set myself (I hope not alone) in\r\nthe most determined opposition.  Never before did we at any time in this\r\ncountry meet upon the theory of our frame of government, to sit in\r\njudgment on the Constitution of our country, to call it as a delinquent\r\nbefore us, and to accuse it of every defect and every vice; to see\r\nwhether it, an object of our veneration, even our adoration, did or did\r\nnot accord with a preconceived scheme in the minds of certain gentlemen.\r\nCast your eyes on the journals of Parliament.  It is for fear of losing\r\nthe inestimable treasure we have, that I do not venture to game it out of\r\nmy hands for the vain hope of improving it.  I look with filial reverence\r\non the Constitution of my country, and never will cut it in pieces, and\r\nput it into the kettle of any magician, in order to boil it, with the\r\npuddle of their compounds, into youth and vigour.  On the contrary, I\r\nwill drive away such pretenders; I will nurse its venerable age, and with\r\nlenient arts extend a parent's breath.",
