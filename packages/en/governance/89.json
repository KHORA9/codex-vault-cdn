For purposes of this entry, the Description\r\n\t\tgoverns.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION: Investment\r\n\r\nWhether an entity is a U.S. citizen\r\ndetermines the type of commercial air\r\nservices company that it can own or\r\ncontrol.  Under the Federal Aviation\r\nAct of 1958 (49 U.S.C. App. Ch. 20),\r\n\"citizens\" include (1) individuals who\r\nare citizens;  (2) a partnership in\r\nwhich each member is a citizen of the\r\nU.S.;  or (3) a U.S. corporation of\r\nwhich the president and at least\r\ntwo-thirds of the board of directors\r\nand other managing officers are U.S.\r\ncitizens, and at least seventy-five\r\npercent of the voting interest in the\r\ncorporation is owned or controlled by\r\nU.S. citizens. 49 U.S.C. App.\r\n1301(16).\r\n\r\nIn addition, this statutory\r\nrequirement has historically been\r\ninterpreted by the Department of\r\nTransportation (and the Civil\r\nAeronautics Board before it) to\r\nrequire that an air carrier in fact be\r\nunder the actual control of U.S.\r\ncitizens.  The Department of\r\nTransportation makes this\r\ndetermination on a case-by-case basis.\r\nNevertheless, the Department has\r\nprovided guidance as to some lines of\r\ndemarcation.  For example, total\r\nforeign equity investment of up to 49\r\npercent (with a maximum of 25 percent\r\nbeing voting stock), taken alone, is\r\nnot construed as indicative of foreign\r\ncontrol.  (See Department of\r\nTransportation Order 91-1-41, January\r\n23, 1991.)\r\n\r\nOnly air carriers that are U.S.\r\ncitizens are permitted to operate\r\ndomestic air services or operate\r\ninternational air services as a \"U.S.\"\r\ncarrier;  non-U.S. citizens may own\r\nand control foreign air carriers that\r\noperate between the U.S. and foreign\r\npoints.  See Sections 401, 402,\r\n417(b)(7) and 1108 of the Federal\r\nAviation Act.  The different rights of\r\neach type of air carrier are usually\r\nspelled out in the applicable aviation\r\nbilateral agreement.\r\n\r\nCertain distinctions based on\r\ncitizenship also exist with regard to\r\nother types of air services providers,\r\nsuch as air freight forwarders (14\r\nC.F.R. 297), charter operators (14\r\nC.F.R. 380), and intermodal operators\r\n(14 C.F.R. 222).\r\n\r\nAir freight forwarders may be \"U.S.\r\ncitizens\" (defined as indicated above)\r\nwhich use the services of (inter alia)\r\ndirect air carriers (with a Department\r\nof Transportation certificate,\r\nregulation, order or permit) to\r\ntransport property. 14 C.F.R. Part\r\n296.  They may also be \"foreign air\r\nfreight forwarders\", which similarly\r\nuse direct air carriers to transport\r\nproperty.  14 C.F.R. Part 296.\tThere\r\nis no \"U.S. citizenship\" requirement\r\nfor \"foreign air freight forwarders.\"\r\n14 C.F.R. 297.3(d).  Foreign air\r\nfreight forwarders may obtain the same\r\noperating exemptions available to U.S.\r\ncitizens.  They must, however, apply\r\nfor registration with the Department\r\nof Transportation.  Their application\r\ncan be rejected \"for reasons relating\r\nto the failure of effective\r\nreciprocity, or if the Department\r\nfinds that it is in the public\r\ninterest to do so.\"  14 C.F.R.\r\n297.22.\r\n\r\nCharter operators may be \"public\r\ncharter operators\", which inter alia\r\nmust be \"U.S. citizens\" (defined as\r\nindicated above) or \"foreign charter\r\noperators,\" for which there is not a\r\ncitizenship requirement.  14 C.F.R.\r\n380.2.

These factors are summarized as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n(a)  the effect of the investment on\r\n  the level and nature of economic\r\n  activity in Canada, including the\r\n  effect on employment, on the\r\n  utilization of parts, components\r\n  and services produced in Canada,\r\n  and on exports from Canada;\r\n\r\n(b)  the degree and significance of\r\n  participation by Canadians in the\r\n  investment;\r\n\r\n(c)  the effect of the investment on\r\n  productivity, industrial\r\n  efficiency, technological\r\n  development and product\r\n  innovation in Canada;\r\n\r\n(d)  the effect of the investment on\r\n  competition within any industry\r\n  or industries in Canada;\r\n\r\n(e)  the compatibility of the\r\n  investment with national\r\n  industrial, economic and cultural\r\n  policies, taking into\r\n  consideration industrial,\r\n  economic and cultural policy\r\n  objectives enunciated by the\r\n  government or legislature of any\r\n  province likely to be\r\n  significantly affected by the\r\n  investment; and\r\n\r\n(f)  the contribution of the\r\n  investment to Canada's ability to\r\n  compete in world markets.\r\n\r\n6.     In making a net benefit\r\ndetermination, the Minister, through\r\nInvestment Canada, may review plans\r\nunder which the applicant demonstrates\r\nthe net benefit to Canada of the\r\nproposed acquisition.  An applicant\r\nmay also submit undertakings to the\r\nMinister in connection with any\r\nproposed acquisition which is the\r\nsubject of review.  In the event of\r\nnoncompliance with an undertaking by\r\nan applicant, the Minister may seek a\r\ncourt order directing compliance or\r\nany other remedy authorized under the\r\nAct.\r\n\r\n7.

Each Foreign Financial Affiliate shall have a paid-in\r\ncapital not less than that authorized by Mexico at the time of\r\napproval of its establishment.\tThe authorized capital shall be\r\ndetermined by Mexico.  After the time of establishment, Mexico\r\nmay permit authorized capital to exceed paid-in capital.\r\nAuthorized capital shall not be reduced by any measure of Mexico\r\n(other than prudential measures) below paid-in capital.  The\r\nmaximum size of the operations of each Foreign Financial\r\nAffiliate shall be determined, on a national treatment basis, as\r\na function of the lesser of its capital or its authorized\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n     ii.  Mexico reserves the right to impose limitations on\r\ntransfers of assets or liabilities by Foreign Financial\r\nAffiliates that have the effect of evading the capital limits set\r\nforth in the Schedule of Mexico.

A Foreign Financial Affiliate shall not issue subordinated\r\ndebentures, except to its parent outside of Mexico.\r\n\r\n5.   The aggregate of the authorized capital of all Foreign\r\nFinancial Affiliates of the same type, measured as a percentage\r\nof the aggregate capital of all financial institutions of such\r\ntype in Mexico, shall not exceed the percentage set forth in the\r\nchart in this paragraph 5 for that type of institution, except\r\nfor the case of insurance which is addressed in paragraph 6 of\r\nthis Part B.  Beginning one year after the entry into force of\r\nthe Agreement, these initial limits shall increase annually in\r\nequal increments so as to reach the final limits specified in the\r\nchart in this paragraph 5 at the beginning of the last year of\r\nthe Transition Period.\r\n\r\n\r\nType of Financial Institution\tPercentage of Total Capital\r\n\t\t\t       Initial\t Final\r\n\t\t\t       Limit\t      Limit\r\n\r\n     Commercial banks\t\t      8%\t    15%\r\n     Securities firms\t\t     10%\t    20%\r\n     Factoring companies\t     10%\t    20%\r\n     Leasing companies\t\t     10%\t    20%\r\n\r\nAny capital in existence as of the date of signature of this\r\nAgreement of a foreign bank branch established in Mexico prior to\r\nsuch date shall be excluded from each of the aggregate capital\r\nlimits referred to in the Schedule of Mexico.\r\n\r\n6.

If the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a\r\ndate after January 1, 1994, the dates and corresponding limits in\r\nthis chart shall nonetheless not be changed.\r\n\r\nThe individual and aggregate capital limits described in\r\nparagraphs 2 and 6 of this Part B shall be measured separately\r\n(through separate accounting) for life and non-life insurance\r\noperations; but both types of insurance operations may be\r\nconducted either by a single or separate Foreign Financial\r\nAffiliates.\r\n\r\n7.   Insurance providers of another Party may elect an\r\nalternative procedure for entering Mexico through phasing-in an\r\nequity interest in a new or existing Mexican insurance company,\r\nand thereby exempt such Mexican company from the capital limits\r\nof paragraphs 2 and 6 of this Part B.  In order to qualify, the\r\npercentage of the Mexican insurance company's voting common stock\r\nthat is owned by Mexican persons must not be less than the levels\r\nset forth in the chart in this paragraph 7 for the respective\r\none-year periods beginning on each of the following dates:\r\n\r\n\t  Date\t\t      Mexican Interest\r\n\r\n     January 1, 1994\t\t     70%\r\n     January 1, 1995\t\t     65%\r\n     January 1, 1996\t\t     60%\r\n     January 1, 1997\t\t     55%\r\n     January 1, 1998\t\t     49%\r\n     January 1, 1999\t\t     25%\r\n\r\nIf the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a date prior\r\nto January 1, 1994, that date shall become the initial date for\r\npurposes of this chart, and each succeeding anniversary of the\r\nentry into force of the Agreement shall become the next\r\nsucceeding date in this chart, with the percentages listed in\r\nthis chart applying to each of the respective periods as so\r\nadjusted.  If the entry into force of the Agreement occurs on a\r\ndate after January 1, 1994, the dates and corresponding limits in\r\nthis chart shall nonetheless not be changed.\r\n\r\nOn and after January 1, 2000 (or, if the entry into force of the\r\nAgreement occurs on a date prior to January 1, 1994, on and after\r\nthe sixth anniversary of such date), the percentage requirement\r\nof Mexican ownership set forth in this paragraph 7 shall no\r\nlonger apply.\r\n\r\nThis paragraph 7 is further modified by paragraph 4 of Part C of\r\nthe Schedule of Mexico to the extent set forth therein.\r\n\r\n8.   The aggregate assets of Foreign Financial Affiliates that\r\nare limited scope financial institutions within the meaning of\r\nparagraph 2 of Part C of the Schedule of Mexico shall not exceed\r\n3% of the sum of (1) the aggregate assets of all commercial banks\r\nin Mexico plus (2) the aggregate assets of all types of limited\r\nscope financial institutions in Mexico.  Lending by affiliates of\r\nautomobile manufacturing companies with respect to their vehicles\r\nshall not be subject to or taken into account in determining\r\ncompliance with this 3% limit.\r\n\r\n9.   The capital limits in paragraphs 2, 5, 6 and 8 of this Part\r\nB shall be removed at the end of the Transition Period.  If the\r\nsum of the authorized capital of Foreign Financial Affiliates,\r\nmeasured as a percentage of the aggregate capital of all\r\nfinancial institutions of such type in Mexico, reaches the\r\npercentage set forth in the chart in this paragraph 9 for such\r\ntype of institutions, then Mexico shall have the right, once\r\nduring the four years following the end of the Transition Period,\r\nto freeze such aggregate capital percentage at its then-existing\r\nlevel:\r\n\r\n     Commercial banks\t\t\t 25%\r\n     Securities firms\t\t\t 30%\r\n\r\nIf applied, such a restriction will have a duration not to exceed\r\na period of 3 years.\r\n\r\n10.  No additional license to establish a Foreign Financial\r\nAffiliate shall be granted during the Transition Period (and, in\r\nthe case of paragraph 9 of this Part B, during the additional\r\nperiods described in that paragraph) if after such issuance the\r\nsum of the authorized capital of all Foreign Financial Affiliates\r\nof the same type would exceed the applicable percentage limit for\r\nthat type of institution in paragraph 5, 6, 8 or 9 of this\r\nPart B.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER EXCEPTIONS\r\n\r\n11.  The provisions of the following paragraphs 12 through 15 of\r\nthis Part B shall apply immediately upon the entry into force of\r\nthe Agreement and at all times thereafter, except as otherwise\r\nspecifically provided in such paragraphs.  Any amendment or\r\nmodification to a measure adopted or maintained pursuant to\r\nparagraphs 12 through 15 of this Part B shall not decrease the\r\nconformity of the measure, as it existed immediately before such\r\namendment or modification, with Articles 1404 to 1409 of the\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\nReservation to Article 1407\r\n\r\n12.  Mexico may require that a Foreign Financial Affiliate (other\r\nthan a Foreign Insurance Affiliate) be wholly-owned by a\r\nfinancial service provider of another Party (except for\r\ndirectors' nominal qualifying shares).\tMexico may also restrict\r\nany Foreign Financial Affiliate from establishing agencies,\r\nbranches, or other direct or indirect subsidiaries in the\r\nterritory of any other country.\r\n\r\nReservations to Articles 1404 and 1407\r\n\r\n13.  Following the Transition Period, acquisition of a commercial\r\nbank established in Mexico, or of the assets or liabilities\r\nthereof, by a financial service provider of another Party will\r\nonly be authorized by Mexico, subject to reasonable prudential\r\nconsiderations on a case by case basis, if the sum of the\r\nauthorized capital of the acquired commercial bank and the\r\nauthorized capital of any commercial bank in Mexico already\r\ncontrolled by the acquiror would not exceed 4% of the aggregate\r\ncapital of all commercial banks in Mexico.\r\n\r\n14.  Mexico may adopt measures that (i) limit eligibility to\r\nestablish a Foreign Financial Affiliate in Mexico to a financial\r\nservice provider of another Party that is, directly or through\r\nany of its affiliates, engaged in the same general type of\r\nfinancial services in the territory of the other Party; and (ii)\r\nlimit such provider (together with its affiliates) to no more\r\nthan one institution of the same type in Mexico.  In determining\r\nwhat types of operations a financial service provider of another\r\nParty is engaged in for purposes of the preceding sentence, all\r\ntypes of insurance shall be considered to be only one type of\r\nfinancial service; but both life and non-life insurance\r\noperations may be conducted either by a single or separate\r\nForeign Financial Affiliates.\r\n\r\nReservation to Articles 1404, 1405 and 1407\r\n\r\n15.  The existing activities and operations of Mexican\r\ngovernmental insurance programs conducted by Aseguradora\r\nMexicana, S.A. or Aseguradora Hidalgo, S.A. (including insurance\r\nfor government employees, agencies, instrumentalities and public\r\nentities) are excluded from Articles 1404, 1405 and 1407 for so\r\nlong as such firm is controlled by the government of Mexico and\r\nfor a commercially reasonable time after such governmental\r\ncontrol ceases.\r\n\r\nReservation to Article 1405\r\n\r\n16.  In order not to impair the conduct of Mexico's monetary and\r\nexchange rate policies, non-resident financial service providers\r\nof another Party shall not be permitted to provide financial\r\nservices into the territory of Mexico or to residents of Mexico,\r\nand residents of Mexico may not purchase financial services from\r\nnon-resident financial service providers of another Party, if\r\nsuch transactions are denominated in Mexican pesos.\r\n\r\nReservation to Articles 1404-1409\r\n\r\n17.  The benefits of this Agreement shall not be extended to a\r\nforeign bank branch existing in Mexico on the date of entry into\r\nforce of this Agreement.  The existing legal regime will continue\r\nto apply to such a branch for so long as it operates in that\r\nform.  Such a branch shall be permitted to convert to a\r\nsubsidiary pursuant to the terms of this Schedule, and upon\r\nconversion shall be covered by this Agreement.\tThe existing\r\ncapital of such branch on the date of signature of this Agreement\r\nshall not be counted against such Foreign Commercial Bank\r\nAffiliate's individual capital limit, or the aggregate capital\r\nlimits for commercial banks in the event of conversion.\r\nDefinitions\r\n\r\nFor purposes of Part B of Mexico's schedule:\r\n\r\ncapital means the following, as defined in Mexican measures,\r\napplied on a national treatment basis:\r\n\r\n   Type of Financial Institution     Concept of \"Capital\"\r\n\r\n     commercial banks\t\t   capital neto\r\n     securities firms\t\t   capital global\r\n     insurance companies\r\n     casualty\t\t requerimiento bruto\r\n\t\t\t      de solvencia (allocation to\r\ncasualty insurance)\r\n\t  life and health\t   requerimiento bruto\r\n\t\t\t      de solvencia (allocation to\r\nlife and health insurance)\r\n     factoring companies\t   capital contable\r\n     leasing companies\t\t   capital contable\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign Commercial Bank Affiliate means a Foreign Financial\r\nAffiliate that is a commercial bank;\r\n\r\nForeign Financial Affiliate means a financial institution\r\nestablished in Mexico and owned and controlled by a financial\r\nservice provider of another Party;\r\n\r\nForeign Insurance Affiliate means a Foreign Financial Affiliate\r\nthat is an insurance company; and\r\n\r\nTransition Period means the period beginning with the entry into\r\nforce of the Agreement and ending on the earlier of i) January 1,\r\n2000, or ii) six years from the entry into force of the\r\nAgreement.\r\n\r\n=============================================================================\r\n\t\t\t\t ANNEX VII\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t  PART C\r\n\r\n\t\t\t    Schedule of Mexico\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC COMMITMENTS\r\n\r\n1.   Mexico shall retain discretion to approve, on a case-by-case\r\nbasis, any affiliation of a commercial bank or securities firm\r\nwith a commercial or industrial corporation that has a commercial\r\npresence in Mexico, if Mexico determines that such affiliation is\r\nharmless and, in the case of banking, either (a) not substantial,\r\nor (b) the financial-related activities of the commercial or\r\nindustrial commercial corporation are at least 90 percent of its\r\nannual income worldwide, and the non-financial activities of such\r\ncommercial or industrial corporation are of a type that Mexico\r\ndetermines to be acceptable.  Affiliation with a non-resident\r\ncommercial or industrial corporation that has no commercial\r\npresence in Mexico will not be a reason for denial of an\r\napplication to establish or acquire a commercial bank or\r\nsecurities firm in Mexico.\r\n\r\n2.   Non-bank financial service providers of another Party shall\r\nbe permitted to establish one or more limited scope financial\r\ninstitutions in Mexico to provide separately consumer lending,\r\ncommercial lending, mortgage lending or credit card services on\r\nterms no less favorable than those applied to like domestic firms\r\nunder Mexican measures.  Mexico may permit lending services\r\nclosely related to the principal authorized business of a limited\r\nscope financial institution to be carried out by that\r\ninstitution.  Such firms shall be provided the opportunity to\r\nraise funds in the securities market for business operations\r\nsubject to normal terms and conditions.  Mexico may restrict such\r\nlimited scope financial institutions from taking deposits.\r\n\r\n3.   Within two years of the entry into force of the Agreement,\r\nMexico shall conduct a study of the desirability and, if\r\ndesirable, the possible methods of establishing limited scope\r\nsecurities firms which would have more limited powers than\r\ncurrent securities firms.  Such limited scope securities firms\r\nwould be subject to differing capital requirements, depending on\r\nthe type and extent of business conducted, that would permit\r\nlower minimum capital requirements than those currently\r\napplicable to Mexican securities firms.  The basis of the study\r\nwould be prudential considerations and opportunities for\r\ninvestment in the securities sector.  As part of the second\r\nannual meeting of the Committee required under Article 1414,\r\nMexico shall report to the other Parties on the outcome of the\r\nstudy, including any plans for the establishment of new\r\ncategories of securities firms.\r\n\r\n4.   Notwithstanding Part B (paragraph 7) of the Schedule of\r\nMexico, an insurance provider of another Party, together with its\r\naffiliates, that as of July 1, 1992 collectively have an active\r\ninvestment or ownership interest that has been specifically\r\napproved by the Mexico of 10% or more in a Mexican insurance\r\ncompany may:  (1) exercise any contract right or option in\r\nexistence as of July 1, 1992 with respect to ownership interests\r\nin such Mexican insurance company; and (2) effective the earlier\r\nof January 1, 1996 or two years following the date of entry into\r\nforce of the Agreement, acquire a controlling interest of up to\r\n100% in such Mexican insurance company.  Before the effective\r\ndate described in clause (2) of the preceding sentence, an\r\ninsurance provider of another Party (together with its\r\naffiliates) described in that sentence may exercise any existing\r\ncontract right or option described in clause (1) of that\r\nsentence, and choose to maintain its existing interest or expand\r\nits interest in such Mexican insurance company to the extent\r\nconsistent with Part B (paragraph 7) of the Schedule of Mexico.\r\nMexico shall maintain discretion to permit acceleration of the\r\nschedule for equity participation in a Mexican insurance company\r\nby an insurance provider of another Party described in the first\r\nsentence of this paragraph.\r\n\r\n5.   A bank or securities provider of another Party that is\r\nauthorized to and establishes or acquires a commercial bank or\r\nsecurities firm, respectively, in Mexico may also establish a\r\nfinancial holding company in Mexico, and thereby establish or\r\nacquire other types of financial institutions in Mexico, under\r\nthe terms of Mexican measures.\r\n\r\n6.   Mexico shall administer its licensing and approval\r\nprocedures during the Transition Period (as defined in Part B of\r\nthe Schedule of Mexico) in a manner that does not deny the\r\nbenefits of the liberalization of existing measures described in\r\nthe Schedule of Mexico to enterprises of another Party ultimately\r\ncontrolled by nationals of that Party.\r\n\r\n=============================================================================\r\n\t\t\t\t ANNEX VII\r\n\r\n\t\t\t\t  PART D\r\n\r\n\t\t\t    Schedule of Mexico\r\n\r\n\r\n     The agency of the government of Mexico responsible for\r\nfinancial services is the Secretar¡a de Hacienda y Crdito\r\nP£blico.\r\nAnnex 0 SECTION III Animal or Vegetable Fats and Oils and Their Cleavage Products;\r\nPrepared Edible Fats;

Mexico shall grant national supplier status to an\r\nindependent maquiladora that requests such status and meets the\r\nrequirements for that status set out in the existing Auto Decree.\r\nMexico shall continue to grant to all independent maquiladoras\r\nthat request national supplier status all existing rights and\r\nprivileges accorded to independent maquiladoras under the\r\nexisting Decree for the Promotion and Operation of the\r\nMaquiladora Export Industry (\"Decreto para el Fomento y Operaci¢n\r\nde la Industria Maquiladora de Exportaci¢n\") (December 22, 1989)\r\n(the \"Maquiladora Decree\").\r\n\r\n4a.  For purposes of paragraph 4, \"independent maquiladora\" means\r\nan enterprise registered as an export maquiladora enterprise\r\nunder the Maquiladora Decree which has no common majority\r\nshareholder with any manufacturer, and for which no manufacturer\r\nis directly or indirectly a majority shareholder.\r\n\r\n     National Value Added\r\n\r\n5.   Mexico may provide that a manufacturer (\"empresa de la\r\nindustria terminal\") calculate its required national value added\r\nfrom suppliers (VANp) as a percentage of:\r\n\r\n     (a) a manufacturer's reference value as defined in\r\n paragraph 8; or\r\n\r\n     (b) a manufacturer's total national value added (VANt),\r\n\r\nwhichever is greater.\r\n\r\n6.   Mexico shall not require that the percentage referred to in\r\nparagraph 5 be greater than:\r\n\r\n     (a) 34 percent for each of the first five years beginning\r\n January 1, 1994;\r\n\r\n     (b) 33 percent for 1999;\r\n\r\n     (c) 32 percent for 2000;\r\n\r\n     (d) 31 percent for 2001;\r\n\r\n     (e) 30 percent for 2002; and\r\n\r\n     (f) 29 percent for 2003.\r\n\r\n7.   Notwithstanding paragraph 6, Mexico shall allow a\r\nmanufacturer that produced vehicles in Mexico before model year\r\n1992 to use as its percentage referred to in paragraph 5 the\r\nratio of actual national value added from suppliers (VANp) to\r\ntotal national value added (VANt) that such manufacturer attained\r\nin model year 1992, for so long as that ratio is lower than the\r\napplicable percentage specified under paragraph 6.  In\r\ndetermining such ratio for 1992, purchases that such manufacturer\r\nmade from independent maquiladoras that would have been eligible\r\nto receive national supplier status had paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of\r\nthis Appendix been in effect at that time, shall be included in\r\nthe calculation of the manufacturer's national value added from\r\nsuppliers (VANp), in the same manner as parts and components from\r\nany other national supplier or enterprise of the autoparts\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\n8.   \"The annual reference value for a manufacturer\" (\"reference\r\nvalue\") shall be:\r\n\r\n     (a) for each of the years 1994 through 1997, the base value\r\n for the manufacturer, plus no more than 65 percent of\r\n the difference between the manufacturer's total sales\r\n in Mexico in that year and its base value;\r\n\r\n     (b) for each of the years 1998 through 2000, the base value\r\n for the manufacturer, plus no more than 60 percent of\r\n the difference between the manufacturer's total sales\r\n in Mexico in that year and its base value; and\r\n\r\n     (c) for each of the years 2001 through 2003, the base value\r\n for the manufacturer, plus no more than 50 percent of\r\n the difference between the manufacturer's total sales\r\n in Mexico in that year and its base value.\r\n\r\n9.   Mexico shall provide that where a manufacturer's total sales\r\nin Mexico in a year are lower than its base value, the reference\r\nvalue for such manufacturer for that year shall be equal to the\r\nmanufacturer's total value of sales in Mexico for the year.\r\n\r\n9a.  For purposes of paragraphs 8 and 9:\r\n\r\n     (a) \"base value\" means the average annual value of the\r\n manufacturer's production in Mexico for sale in Mexico\r\n (VTVd) in model years 1991 and 1992, adjusted for\r\n inflation, using the Mexican producer price index for\r\n automotive goods published by the Bank of Mexico\r\n (\"Banco de Mexico\"); and\r\n\r\n     (b) \"manufacturer's total sales in Mexico in that year\"\r\n means the invoice value of sales by a manufacturer of\r\n vehicles it produced in Mexico for sale in Mexico plus\r\n the invoice value of its sales of imported vehicles.\r\n\r\n10.  In the event an abnormal production disruption affects a\r\nmanufacturer's production capability, Mexico shall allow such\r\nmanufacturer to seek a reduction in its reference value before\r\nthe Intersecretariat Automotive Industry Commission, established\r\nunder Chapter V of the Auto Decree.  If the Commission finds that\r\nthe production capability of the manufacturer has been impaired\r\nby such an abnormal production disruption, the Commission shall\r\nreduce the manufacturer's reference value in an amount\r\ncommensurate to such event.\r\n\r\n10a. For purposes of paragraph 10, \"abnormal production\r\ndisruption\" means a disruption in a manufacturer's production\r\ncapability resulting from a natural disaster, fire, explosion or\r\nother unforeseen event beyond the manufacturer's control.\r\n\r\n11.  If, upon the request of a manufacturer, the Intersecretariat\r\nAutomotive Industry Commission finds that the production\r\ncapability of such manufacturer has been significantly disrupted\r\nas a result of a major retooling or plant conversion in the\r\nfacilities of the manufacturer, the Commission shall reduce the\r\nreference value for the manufacturer for that year in an amount\r\ncommensurate with the disruption, provided that such reduction in\r\nthat manufacturer's required national value added from suppliers\r\n(VANp) that may result from the Commission's determination to\r\nlower the manufacturer's reference value shall be fully made up\r\nby the manufacturer over the following two model years.\r\n\r\n11a.  For purposes of paragraph 11, \"significant disruption\"\r\nmeans a sizable impairment in the manufacturer's production\r\ncapability that lasts at least six months but no longer than 12\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n     Trade Balance\r\n\r\n12.  Mexico shall not require a manufacturer to include in the\r\ncalculation of its trade balance (S) a percentage of the value of\r\ndirect and indirect imports of parts and components that such\r\nmanufacturer incorporated into vehicles it has produced in Mexico\r\nfor sale in Mexico (VTVd) in the corresponding year, greater than\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     (a) 80 percent for 1994;\r\n\r\n     (b) 77.2 percent for 1995;\r\n\r\n     (c) 74.4 percent for 1996;\r\n\r\n     (d) 71.6 percent for 1997;\r\n\r\n     (e) 68.9 percent for 1998;\r\n\r\n     (f) 66.1 percent for 1999;\r\n\r\n     (g) 63.3 percent for 2000;\r\n\r\n     (h) 60.5 percent for 2001;\r\n\r\n     (i) 57.7 percent for 2002; and\r\n\r\n     (j) 55.0 percent for 2003.\r\n\r\n13.  For purposes of determining a manufacturer's total national\r\nvalue added (VANt), paragraph 12 shall not apply to the\r\ncalculation of its trade balance (S).\r\n\r\n14.  Mexico shall permit a manufacturer with a surplus in its\r\nextended trade balance to divide its extended trade balance by\r\nthe applicable percentages in paragraph 12 to determine the value\r\nof new vehicles that it may import.\r\n\r\n15.  Mexico shall provide that in the calculation of a\r\nmanufacturer's adjustment factor (Y) in its extended trade\r\nbalance:\r\n\r\n     (a) a manufacturer's total national value added (VANt) be\r\n replaced by that manufacturer's reference value in any\r\n year in which the manufacturer's total national value\r\n added (VANt) is lower than its reference value; and\r\n\r\n     (b) the applicable percentage under paragraphs 6 or 7, as\r\n appropriate, be used.\r\n\r\n16.  In determining the annual amount that a manufacturer may\r\napply to its extended trade balance from surpluses earned prior\r\nto model year 1991, Mexico shall in any given year allow such\r\nmanufacturer to elect:\r\n\r\n     (a) to use the procedures of the existing Auto Decree\r\n Implementing Regulation; or\r\n\r\n     (b) to apply up to $US 150 million, adjusted for inflation\r\n in accordance with the U.S. GDP Price Deflator or its\r\n equivalent in Mexican pesos,\r\n\r\nuntil such surpluses have been exhausted.\r\n\r\n     Other Restrictions in the Auto Decree\r\n\r\n17.  Mexico shall eliminate the restriction set out in the\r\nexisting Auto Decree that limits the number of vehicles that a\r\nmanufacturer may import into Mexico in relation to the total\r\nnumber of vehicles that such manufacturer sells in Mexico.\r\n\r\n     Autotransportation Decree and Autotransportation\r\nImplementing Regulations\r\n\r\n18.  Mexico shall eliminate the Mexican Decree for Development\r\nand Modernization of the Autotransportation Vehicle Manufacturing\r\nIndustry (December 1989) (\"Decreto para el Fomento y\r\nModernizaci¢n de la Industria Manufacturera de Vehiculos de\r\nAutotransporte\") (the \"Autotransportation Decree\") and the\r\nResolution that Establishes Rules for the Implementation of the\r\nAutotransportation Decree (November 1990) (\"Acuerdo que Establece\r\nReglas de Aplicacion del Decreto para el Fomento y Modernizaci¢n\r\nde la Industria Manufacturera de Veh¡culos de Autotransporte\")\r\n(the \"Autotransportation Decree Implementing Regulations\").\r\nMexico may adopt or maintain any measure respecting\r\nautotransportation vehicles or manufacturers of\r\nautotransportation vehicles in its territory provided that such\r\nmeasure is not inconsistent with this Agreement.\r\n\r\n     Importation of Autotransportation Vehicles\r\n\r\n19.  Except as provided in paragraphs 20 and 21, Mexico may adopt\r\nor maintain a prohibition or restriction on the importation of\r\nautotransportation vehicles of another Party until January 1,\r\n1999.\r\n\r\n20.  For each of the years 1994 through 1998, Mexico shall allow\r\nany manufacturer of autotransportation vehicles to import, for\r\neach type of autotransportation vehicle, a quantity of\r\noriginating autotransportation vehicles equal to at least 50\r\npercent of the number of vehicles of such type that such\r\nmanufacturer produced in Mexico in that year.\r\n\r\n20a.  For purposes of paragraph 20, \"manufacturer of\r\nautotransportation vehicles\" means an enterprise, established in\r\nMexico, that produces autotransportation vehicles, is registered\r\nwith the Ministry of Trade and Industrial Development\r\n(\"Secretar¡a de Comercia y Fomento Industrial\"), and whose sales\r\nin Mexico incorporate at least 40 percent national value added,\r\nwhere national value added is the result of subtracting from the\r\ntotal sales (excluding imports of autotransportation vehicles) of\r\nan autotransportation manufacturer the invoice value of its\r\ndirect and indirect imports of parts and components.\r\n\r\n21.  For each of the years 1994 through 1998, Mexico shall allow\r\npersons other than manufacturers of autotransportation vehicles\r\nto import, in a quantity to be allocated among them, originating\r\nautotransportation vehicles of each type as follows:\r\n\r\n     (a) for each of the years 1994 and 1995, no less than 15\r\n percent of the total number of vehicles of each type of\r\n autotransportation vehicle produced in Mexico;\r\n\r\n     (b) for 1996, no less than 20 percent of the total number\r\n of vehicles of each type of autotransportation vehicle\r\n produced in Mexico; and\r\n\r\n     (c) for each of the years 1997 and 1998, no less than 30\r\n percent of the total number of vehicles of each type of\r\n autotransportation vehicle produced in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMexico shall allocate such quantity through a non-discriminatory\r\nauction.\r\n\r\n     Used Vehicles\r\n\r\n22.  Mexico may adopt or maintain prohibitions and restrictions\r\non imports of used vehicles from the territory of another Party,\r\nexcept as follows:\r\n\r\n     (a) after January 1, 2009, Mexico may not adopt or maintain\r\n prohibitions or restrictions on imports from the\r\n territories of Canada or United States of originating\r\n used vehicles that are at least ten years old;\r\n\r\n     (b) after January 1, 2011, Mexico may not adopt or maintain\r\n prohibitions or restrictions on imports from the\r\n territories of Canada or United States of originating\r\n used vehicles that are at least eight years old;\r\n\r\n     (c) after January 1, 2013, Mexico may not adopt or maintain\r\n prohibitions or restrictions on imports from the\r\n territories of Canada or United States of originating\r\n used vehicles that are at least six years old;\r\n\r\n     (d) after January 1, 2015, Mexico may not adopt or maintain\r\n prohibitions or restrictions on imports from the\r\n territories of Canada or United States of originating\r\n used vehicles that are at least four years old;\r\n\r\n     (e) after January 1, 2017, Mexico may not adopt or maintain\r\n prohibitions or restrictions on imports from the\r\n territories of Canada or United States of originating\r\n used vehicles that are at least two years old; and\r\n\r\n     (f) after January 1, 2019, Mexico may not adopt or maintain\r\n prohibitions or restrictions on imports from the\r\n territories of Canada or United States of originating\r\n used vehicles, regardless of age.\r\n\r\n=============================================================================\r\n\r\n\t\t\t  Appendix B: Definitions\r\n\r\nNote:\t  (The following terms shall be defined as provided in\r\nthe Auto Decree and Auto Decree Implementing Regulations,\r\nincorporating those specific modifications required by this\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\n     For purposes of transparency, set out below for each term\r\nare the corresponding Spanish term, citations to the relevant\r\nprovisions of the Auto Decree and Auto Decree Implementing\r\nRegulations and, where appropriate, the paragraph of this\r\nAppendix that modifies the definition in the Auto Decree or Auto\r\nDecree Implementing Regulations.

During the transition period only, if, as a result of the\r\nreduction or elimination of a duty provided for in this\r\nAgreement, an originating textile or apparel good, or a good that\r\nhas been integrated into the GATT pursuant to a commitment\r\nundertaken by a Party under any successor agreement to the\r\nMultifiber Arrangement and entered under a tariff preference\r\nlevel set out in Appendix 6.0, is being imported into the\r\nterritory of another Party in such increased quantities, in\r\nabsolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that good,\r\nand under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual\r\nthreat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or\r\ndirectly competitive good, the importing Party may, to the extent\r\nnecessary to remedy the damage or actual threat thereof:\r\n\r\n     (a) suspend the further reduction of any rate of duty\r\n provided for under this Agreement on such good; or\r\n\r\n     (b) increase the rate of duty on such good to a level not\r\n to exceed the lesser of:\r\n\r\n     (i) the most-favored-nation (MFN) applied rate of duty\r\n in effect at the time the action is taken, or\r\n\r\n     (ii) the MFN applied rate of duty in effect on the day\r\n immediately preceding the date of entry into force\r\n of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n2.   In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the\r\nParty shall:\r\n\r\n     (a) examine the effect of increased imports on the\r\n particular industry, as reflected in the following\r\n factors, none of which is necessarily decisive:\r\n changes in such relevant economic variables as output,\r\n productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories,\r\n market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic\r\n prices, profits and investment; and\r\n\r\n     (b) not consider changes in technology or consumer\r\n preference as factors supporting a determination of\r\n serious damage or actual threat thereof.\r\n\r\n3.   The following conditions and limitations shall apply to any\r\nemergency action taken pursuant to this Section:\r\n\r\n     (a) a Party shall deliver without delay to any Party that\r\n may be affected written notice of intent to take such\r\n action, and shall enter into consultations with that\r\n Party upon request;\r\n\r\n     (b) no action may be maintained for a period exceeding\r\n three years or, except with the consent of the Party\r\n against whose good the action is taken, have effect\r\n beyond the expiration of the transition period;\r\n\r\n     (c) no action may be taken by a Party against any\r\n particular originating good more than once during the\r\n transition period; and\r\n\r\n     (d) upon the termination of the action, the rate of duty\r\n shall be the rate that, according to the Schedule for\r\n that staged elimination of the tariff, would have been\r\n in effect a year after the commencement of the action,\r\n and commencing January 1 of the year following the\r\n termination of the action, at the option of the Party\r\n that has taken the action:\r\n\r\n     (i) the rate of duty shall conform to the schedule in\r\n that Party's Schedule in Annex 302.2, or\r\n\r\n     (ii) the tariff shall be eliminated in equal annual\r\n stages ending on the date set forth in that\r\n Party's Schedule in Annex 302.2 for the\r\n elimination of the tariff.\r\n\r\n4.   A Party taking an action under this Section shall provide,\r\nto the Party against whose good the action is taken, mutually\r\nagreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions\r\nhaving substantially equivalent trade effects on the other Party,\r\nor equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to\r\nresult from the action.  Such concessions shall be limited to the\r\ntextile and apparel goods listed in Appendix 1.1, unless the\r\nParties otherwise agree.  If the concerned Parties are unable to\r\nagree on compensation, the exporting Party may take tariff action\r\nhaving trade effects substantially equivalent to the action taken\r\nunder this Section against any goods imported from the Party that\r\ninitiated the action pursuant to this Section.\tThe Party taking\r\nsuch tariff action shall only apply it for the minimum period\r\nnecessary to achieve such substantially equivalent effects.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5:  Bilateral Emergency Actions (Quantitative\r\nRestrictions)\r\n\r\n1.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement except\r\nAppendix 5.2, a Party may take bilateral emergency action against\r\nnon-originating goods of another Party in accordance with this\r\nSection and the provisions of Appendix 3.1.\r\n\r\n2.   If a Party considers that non-originating textile and\r\napparel goods, including goods entered under the tariff\r\npreference levels (TPLs) set out in Appendix 6.0, are being\r\nimported into its territory from a Party in such increased\r\nquantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market,\r\nso as to cause serious damage or actual threat thereof, to a\r\ndomestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good\r\nin the importing Party, that Party may request consultations with\r\nanother Party with a view to eliminating the serious damage or\r\nactual threat thereof.\r\n\r\n3.   The Party requesting consultations shall include in its\r\nrequest for consultations the reasons that it considers\r\ndemonstrate that such serious damage or actual threat to its\r\ndomestic industry is resulting from the imports of the other\r\nParty, including the latest data concerning such damage or\r\nthreat.\r\n\r\n4.   In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the\r\nParty shall apply the provisions of paragraph 2, Section 4.\r\n\r\n5.   The concerned Parties shall commence consultations within 60\r\ndays following the request for consultations and shall endeavor\r\nto agree on a mutually satisfactory level of restraint on exports\r\nof the particular good within 90 days of the request, unless the\r\nconsulting Parties agree to extend this period.  In reaching a\r\nmutually satisfactory level of export restraint, the consulting\r\nParties shall:\r\n\r\n     (a) consider the situation in the market in the importing\r\n Party;\r\n\r\n     (b) consider the history of trade in textile and apparel\r\n goods between the consulting Parties, including the\r\n previous levels of trade; and\r\n\r\n     (c) ensure that textile and apparel goods imported from the\r\n territory of another Party are accorded equitable\r\n treatment as compared with treatment granted to other\r\n non-Party suppliers of like textile and apparel goods.\r\n\r\n6.   If the Parties do not agree on a mutually satisfactory level\r\nduring the 90-day consultation period, the Party requesting\r\nconsultations may impose annual quantitative restrictions on\r\nimports of the good from the territory of the other Party for a\r\nperiod no longer than that provided for in paragraph 9, provided\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n     (a) the measure shall not have effect beyond the transition\r\n period; and\r\n\r\n     (b) the quantitative restriction shall not be less than the\r\n sum of\r\n\r\n     (i) the quantity of the good imported into its\r\n territory from the Party that would be affected by\r\n the restriction, as reported in general import\r\n statistics, during the first 12 of the most recent\r\n 14 months preceding the month in which the request\r\n for consultations was made, and\r\n\r\n     (ii) an additional 20 percent of such quantity for\r\n cotton, man-made fiber and other non-cotton\r\n vegetable fiber good categories and six percent\r\n for wool good categories.\r\n\r\n7.   The first term of any quantitative restriction imposed under\r\nparagraph 6 shall commence on the day following the request for\r\nconsultations and terminate at the end of the calendar year in\r\nwhich the quantitative restriction was imposed.  Any quantitative\r\nrestriction that is imposed for a term less than 12 months and\r\nthe applicable flexibility provisions shall be prorated to\r\ncorrespond to the period of time remaining in the calendar year\r\nin which the restriction is imposed.\r\n\r\n8.   For each successive calendar year that the quantitative\r\nrestriction imposed under paragraph 6 remains in effect, the\r\nParty imposing it shall:\r\n\r\n     (a) increase by 6 percent restrictions on cotton, man-made\r\n fiber and non-cotton vegetable fiber textile and\r\n apparel goods and by 2 percent restrictions on wool\r\n textile and apparel goods;\r\n\r\n     (b) accelerate the growth rate for quantitative\r\n restrictions on cotton, man-made fiber and non-cotton\r\n vegetable fiber textile and apparel goods if required\r\n by any successor agreement to the Multifiber\r\n Arrangement; and\r\n\r\n     (c) apply the flexibility provisions set forth in Appendix\r\n 3.1, as appropriate.\r\n\r\n9.   Quantitative restrictions established pursuant to paragraph\r\n6 before July 1 in any given calendar year may remain in place\r\nfor the initial prorated period in the first calendar year, plus\r\ntwo additional calendar years.\tSuch restrictions established on\r\nor after July 1 in any given calendar year may remain in place\r\nfor the initial prorated period plus three additional calendar\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n10.  No Party may take an emergency action under this Section\r\nwith respect to any textile or apparel non-originating good that\r\nis already subject to a quantitative restriction.\r\n\r\n11.  No party may adopt or maintain a quantitative restriction\r\nunder this Section on a textile or apparel good if that good has\r\nbeen integrated into the GATT as a result of commitments\r\nundertaken by that Party pursuant to any successor agreement to\r\nthe Multifiber Arrangement.\r\n\r\n12.  A Party may take a bilateral emergency action after the\r\nexpiration of the transition period to deal with cases of serious\r\ndamage to domestic industry arising from the operation of this\r\nAgreement only with the consent of the Party against whose good\r\nthe action would be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 6:  Special Provisions\r\n\r\n     A Party shall treat the textile or apparel goods of another\r\nParty set out in Appendix 6.0 in accordance with the provisions\r\ntherein.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 7:  Review and Revision of Rules of Origin\r\n\r\n1.   (a) The Parties shall monitor the effects of the\r\n application of the rule of origin contained in Annex\r\n 401.1 applicable to goods of subheading 6212.10.  No\r\n earlier than 15 months after the date of entry into\r\n force of this Agreement, any Party may request\r\n consultations to seek a mutually satisfactory solution\r\n to any difficulties that it considers results from the\r\n application of that rule of origin.\r\n\r\n     (b) If the Parties fail to reach a mutually satisfactory\r\n solution through consultations within 90 days of a\r\n request for consultations, any Party may request that\r\n the rule applicable to subheading 6212.10 be changed to\r\n the rule applicable to headings 62.06 through 62.11 of\r\n the Harmonized System (HS) with respect to trade with\r\n the requesting Party.\tAny such change shall be\r\n effective no earlier than 180 days following the\r\n request therefor.  The Parties shall take measures to\r\n ease any resulting administrative burden on producers.\r\n\r\n     (c) Unless otherwise agreed, at any time after the initial\r\n consultations, and within the transition period of this\r\n Agreement, any Party may make one request for\r\n additional consultations under the same procedures\r\n provided in paragraphs (a) and (b).\r\n\r\n2.   (a) At the request of any Party, the Parties shall consult\r\n to consider whether specific goods should be made\r\n subject to different rules of origin in order to\r\n address issues of availability of supply of fibers,\r\n yarns or fabrics within the free trade area.\r\n\r\n     (b) In the consultations, each Party shall consider all\r\n data presented by a Party showing substantial\r\n production in its territory for a good submitted for\r\n review.  A legitimate claim of substantial production\r\n of the good in the territory of a Party shall be deemed\r\n to exist if that Party can show that its domestic\r\n producers are capable of supplying commercial\r\n quantities of the good in a timely manner.\r\n\r\n     (c) The Parties shall make every effort to conclude\r\n consultations within sixty days.  Any agreement between\r\n two or more Parties resulting from these consultations\r\n shall be considered part of this Agreement.  If\r\n agreement is not reached, the Parties have recourse to\r\n the provisions of paragraph 8(a) of Appendix 6.6.\r\n\r\n     (d) In this context, at the request of any Party, the\r\n Parties shall consult to consider whether the rules of\r\n origin applicable to the following provisions in Annex\r\n 401.1 should be amended in view of increasing\r\n availability of supply of relevant yarns or fabrics\r\n within the free trade area;\r\n\r\n     (i) Canadian tariff item 5407.60.10, United States\r\n tariff item 5407.60.22 and Mexican tariff item\r\n 5407.60.02,\r\n\r\n     (ii) provisions (i) through (viii) of the rule for\r\n subheadings 6205.20 through 6205.30,\r\n\r\n     (iii) note 2 to Chapter 61,\r\n\r\n     (iv) note 2 to Chapter 62, and\r\n\r\n     (v) Canadian tariff item 6303.92.a1, United States\r\n tariff item 6303.92.h1 and Mexican tariff item\r\n 6303.92.x1.\r\n\r\n3.   The Parties shall review the rules of origin applicable to\r\ntextile and apparel goods within five years after the date of\r\nentry into force of this Agreement to take into account the\r\neffect of increasing global competition on textile and apparel\r\ngoods, and the implications of any integration into the GATT of\r\ntextile and apparel goods pursuant to any successor agreement to\r\nthe Multifiber Arrangement.  The Parties shall give particular\r\nconsideration to operative rules in other economic association or\r\nintegration agreements and developments related to textile and\r\napparel production and trade between the Parties and worldwide.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 8:  Labelling Requirements\r\n\r\n     To facilitate trade in textile and apparel goods between the\r\nParties through the harmonization of domestic labelling\r\nrequirements and the elimination of unnecessary obstacles to\r\ntrade resulting from differences in such requirements, the\r\nSubcommittee on Labelling of Textile and Apparel Goods\r\nestablished under Article 913(5) shall perform the functions set\r\nout in Annex 913-D.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 9:  Trade in Worn Clothing and Other Worn Articles\r\n\r\n1.   The Parties hereby establish a Committee on Trade in Worn\r\nClothing comprising representatives of each Party. The purpose of\r\nthe Committee shall be to assess the potential effects that may\r\nresult from the elimination of restrictions, maintained by a\r\nParty prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement, on\r\ntrade in worn clothing and other worn articles as defined in the\r\nheading 63.09 of the HS.  This Committee shall:\r\n\r\n     (a) include or consult with a broadly representative group\r\n from the manufacturing and retailing sectors in each\r\n Party; and\r\n\r\n     (b) act in a transparent manner and reach recommendations\r\n by consensus of all representatives involved.\r\n\r\n2.   The Committee shall develop and pursue a work program to\r\nconsider the potential benefits and risks that may be derived\r\nfrom the elimination of restrictions on trade between the Parties\r\nin worn clothing and other worn articles, including the effects\r\non business and employment opportunities, and on the market for\r\ntextile and apparel goods in each Party.\r\n\r\n3.   Notwithstanding Article 309 and paragraph 2 of Section 3, a\r\nParty may maintain restrictions in effect upon the date of entry\r\ninto force of this Agreement on the importation of worn clothing\r\nand other worn articles classified under heading 63.09 of the HS,\r\nunless the Parties agree otherwise on the basis of the\r\nrecommendations presented to the Commission by the Committee

A Party applying a restriction or consultation level on non-\r\noriginating goods pursuant to Section 5 or paragraph 8 of this\r\nAppendix shall apply it in accordance with this Appendix and its\r\nSchedules.\r\n\r\n2.   An exporting Party whose textile or apparel good is subject\r\nto a restriction or consultation level shall limit its annual\r\nexports to the specified limits or levels, and the importing\r\nParty may assist the exporting Party in implementing such\r\nrestriction or consultation level by controlling its imports.\r\n\r\n3.

If the\r\n importing Party does not consider that sufficient\r\n shortfall exists, it will promptly provide data to\r\n support that view.  If substantial statistical\r\n differences exist between the import and export\r\n data upon which shortfall for a given period is\r\n computed, the Parties shall work to resolve these\r\n differences promptly.\r\n\r\nProvisions Applicable Only to Trade between Mexico and the United\r\nStates\r\n\r\n8.   During the transition period, non-originating textile and\r\napparel goods of Mexico exported to the United States shall be\r\nsubject to the restrictions and consultation levels specified in\r\nSchedule 3.1.2, in accordance with this Appendix and its\r\nSchedules.
