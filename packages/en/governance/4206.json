LANE\r\n\r\nPersonal and Political\r\n\r\nEDITED BY ANNE WINTERMUTE LANE AND LOUISE HERRICK WALL\r\n\r\nWITH ILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nProm the thousands of typewritten letters found in his files, and\r\nfrom the many holograph letters sent to me from his friends in\r\ndifferent parts of the country, we have attempted, in this volume,\r\nto select chiefly those letters which tell the story of Franklin\r\nK. Lane's life as it unfolded itself in service to his country\r\nwhich was his passion. A few technical letters have been included,\r\nbecause they represent some incomplete and original phases of the\r\nwork he attempted,--work, to which he brought an intensity of\r\ninterest and devotion that usually is given only to private\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\nIn editing his letters we have omitted much, but we have in no way\r\nchanged anything that he wrote. Even where, in his haste, there\r\nhas been an obvious slip of the pen, we have left it. Owing to his\r\ndictating to many stenographers, with their varying methods of\r\npunctuation and paragraphing, and because the letters that he\r\nwrote himself were often dashed off on the train, in bed, or in a\r\nhurried five minutes before some engagement, we found in them no\r\nuniformity of punctuation. In writing hastily he used only a\r\nfrequent dash and periods; these letters we have made agree with\r\nthose which were more formally written.\r\n\r\nWith the oncoming of war his correspondence enormously increased--\r\nthe more demanded of him, the more he seemed able to accomplish.\r\nUpon opening his files it took us weeks to run through and destroy\r\njust the requests for patronage, for commissions, passports,\r\nappointments as chaplains, promotions, demands from artists who\r\ndesired to work on camouflage, farmers and chemists who wished\r\nexemption, requests for appointments to the War Department;\r\nletters asking for every kind of a position from that of night-\r\nwatchman to that of Brigadier-General. For his friends, and even\r\nthose who had no special claim upon him, knew that they could\r\ncount on his interest in them.\r\n\r\nOne of his secretaries, Joseph J. Cotter, a man he greatly\r\ntrusted, in describing his office work says: \"Whatever was of\r\nhuman interest, interested Mr. Lane. His researches were by no\r\nmeans limited to the Department of the Interior. For instance, I\r\nremember that at one time, before the matter had been given any\r\nconsideration in any other quarter, he asked Secretary of\r\nAgriculture Houston to come to his office, in the Interior\r\nDepartment, and went with him into the question of the number of\r\nships it would take to transport our soldiers to the other side.\r\nAnd as a result of this conference, a plan was laid before the\r\nSecretary of War. I remember this particularly because it\r\nnecessitated my looking up dead-weight tonnage, and other matters,\r\nwith which I was entirely unfamiliar. ...\r\n\r\n\"I have never known any one who could with equal facility follow\r\nan intricate line of thought through repeated interruptions. I\r\nhave seen Mr. Lane, when interrupted in the middle of an involved\r\nsentence of dictation, talk on some other subject for five or ten\r\nminutes and return to his dictation, taking it up where he left it\r\nand completing the sentence so that it could be typed as dictated,\r\nand this without the stenographer's telling him at what point he\r\nhad been interrupted.\"\r\n\r\nHis letters are peculiarly autobiographical, for whenever his\r\nactive mind was engaged on some personal, political, or\r\nphilosophical problem, his thought turned naturally to that friend\r\nwith whom he would most like to discuss the subject, and, if he\r\ncould possibly make the time, to him he wrote just what thoughts\r\nraced through his mind. To Ambassador Page he wrote in 1918, \"I\r\nhave a very old-fashioned love for writing from day to day what\r\npops into my mind, contradicting each day what I said the day\r\nbefore, and gathering from my friends their impressions and their\r\nspirit in the same way.\" And in another letter he says, \"Now I\r\nhave gossiped, and preached, and prophesied, and mourned, and\r\notherwise revealed what passes through a wandering mind in half an\r\nhour, so I send you at the close of this screed, my blessing,\r\nwhich is a poor gift.\"\r\n\r\nAt home on Sunday morning before the fire, he would often write\r\nmany letters--some of them twenty pages in length and some mere\r\nscrappy notes. He wrote with a pencil on a pad on his knee,\r\nrapidly stripping off the sheets for me to read, in his desire to\r\nshare all that was his, even his innermost thoughts.\r\n\r\nTo the many correspondents who have generously returned to me\r\ntheir letters, and with no restrictions as to their use, I wish\r\nparticularly to express here my profound gratitude. The limits of\r\none volume have made it possible to use only a part of those\r\nreceived, deeply as I have regretted the necessity of omitting any\r\nof them. In making these acknowledgments I wish especially to\r\nthank John H. Wigmore, since to him we owe all the early letters--\r\nthe only ones covering that period.\r\n\r\nFor possible future use I shall be grateful for any letters that I\r\nhave not already seen, and if in the preparation of these letters\r\nfor publication we have allowed any mistakes to slip in, I hope\r\nthat the error will be called to my attention.\r\n\r\nAnne Wintermute Lane\r\n\r\nMarch, 1922\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nI.

LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\nYouth--Education--Characteristics\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Franklin Knight Lane was only fifty-seven years old when\r\nhe died, May 18, 1921, he had outlived, by many years, the men and\r\nwomen who had most influenced the shaping of his early life. Of\r\nhis mother he wrote, in trying to comfort a friend, \"The mystery\r\nand the ordering of this world grows altogether inexplicable. ...\r\nIt requires far more religion or philosophy than I have, to say a\r\nreal word that might console one who has lost those who are dear\r\nto him. Ten years ago my mother died, and I have never been\r\nreconciled to her loss.\" Again he wrote of her, to his sister,\r\nwhen their brother Frederic--the joyous, outdoor comrade of his\r\nyouth--was in his last illness, \"Dear Fritz, dear, dear boy, how I\r\nwish I could be there with him, though I could do no good. ... Each\r\nnight I pray for him, and I am so much of a Catholic, that I pray\r\nto the only Saint I know, or ever knew, and ask her to help. If\r\nshe lives, her mind can reach the minds of the doctors. ... I don't\r\nneed her to intercede with God, but I would like her to intercede\r\nwith men. Why, Oh! why, do we not know whether she is or not? Then\r\nall the Universe would be explained to me.\"\r\n\r\nFrom those who knew him best from childhood, no word of him is\r\nleft, and none from the two men whose strength and ideality\r\ncolored his morning at the University of California--Dr. George\r\nH. Howison, the \"darling Howison\" of the William James' Letters,\r\nand Dr. Joseph H. Le Conte, the wise and gentle geologist. \"Names\r\nthat were Sierras along my skyline,\" Lane said of such men. To Dr.\r\nHowison he wrote in 1913, when entering President Wilson's\r\nCabinet, \"No letter that I have ever received has given me more\r\nreal pleasure than yours, and no man has been more of an\r\ninspiration than you.\"\r\n\r\nThe sealing of almost every source of intimate knowledge of the\r\nboy, who was a mature man at twenty-two, has left the record of\r\nthe early period curiously scant. Fortunately, there are in his\r\nletters and speeches some casual allusions to his childhood and\r\nyouth, and a few facts and anecdotes of the period from members of\r\nhis family, from school, college, and early newspaper associates.\r\nIn 1888, the story begins to gather form and coherence, for at\r\nthat date we have the first of his own letters that have been\r\npreserved, written to his lifelong friend, John H. Wigmore. With\r\nmany breaks, especially in the early chapters, the sequence of\r\nevents, and his moods toward them, pour from him with increasing\r\nfullness and spontaneity, until the day before he died.\r\n\r\nAll the later record exists in his letters, most of them written\r\nalmost as unconsciously as the heart sends blood to the remotest\r\nmembers of the body; and they come back, now, in slow diastole,\r\nbearing within themselves evidence of the hour and day and place\r\nof their inception; letters written with the stub of a pencil on\r\ncopy-paper, at some sleepless dawn; or, long ago, in the wide-\r\nspaced type of a primitive traveling typewriter, and dated,\r\nperhaps, on the Western desert, while he was on his way to secure\r\nwater for thirsty settlers; or dashed off in the glowing moment\r\njust after a Cabinet meeting, with the heat of the discussion\r\nstill in his veins; others on the paper of the Department of the\r\nInterior, with the symbol of the buffalo--chosen by him--richly\r\nembossed in white on the corner, and other letters, soiled and\r\nworn from being long carried in the pocket and often re-read, by\r\nthe brave old reformer who had hailed Lane when he first entered\r\nthe lists. This is the part of the record that cannot be\r\ntranscribed.\r\n\r\nFranklin Knight Lane was born on July 15, 1864, on his father's\r\nfarm near Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada, the eldest\r\nof four children, all born within a few years. The low, white\r\nfarmhouse that is his birthplace still stands pleasantly\r\nsurrounded by tall trees, and at one side a huge, thirty-foot\r\nhedge of hawthorn blooms each spring. His father, Christopher S.\r\nLane, was at the time of his son's birth a preacher. Later, when\r\nhis voice was affected by recurrent bronchitis, he became a\r\ndentist. Lane speaks of him several times in his letters as a\r\nPresbyterian, and alludes to the strict orthodoxy of his father's\r\nfaith, especially in regard to an active and personal devil.\r\n\r\nIn 1917, when in the Cabinet, during President Wilson's second\r\nterm of office, Lane wrote to his brother, \"To-night we give a\r\ndinner to the Canadians, Sir George Foster, the acting Premier,\r\nand Sir Joseph Polk, the Under-Secretary of External Affairs, who,\r\nby the way, was born in Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, and\r\nsays that he heard our father preach.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was from his mother, whose maiden name was Caroline Burns,\r\nand who was of direct Scotch ancestry, that Franklin Lane drew\r\nmost of his physical and many of his mental traits. From her he\r\nderived the firmly-modeled structure of his face; the watchful\r\nScotch eyes; a fine white skin, that weathered to an even brown,\r\nlater in life; remarkably sound teeth, large and regular, giving\r\nfirm support to the round contour of the face; and the fresh line\r\nof his lips, that was a marked family trait. A description of him,\r\nwhen he was candidate for Governor of California, at thirty-eight,\r\nwas written by Grant Wallace. Cleared of some of the hot sweetness\r\nof a campaign rhapsody it reads:--\r\n\r\n\"Picture a man a little above the average height ... with the deep\r\nchest and deep voice that always go with the born leader of men;\r\nthe bigness and strength of the hands ... the clear eye and broad,\r\nfirm, and expressive mouth, and the massive head that suggests\r\nirresistibly a combination of Napoleon and Ingersoll.\"\r\n\r\nThese two resemblances, to Napoleon and to Robert Ingersoll, were\r\nfrequently rediscovered by others, in later years.\r\n\r\nThe description concludes by saying, \"That Lane is a man of\r\nearnestness and vigorous action is shown in ... every movement.\r\nYou sit down to chat with him in his office. As he grows\r\ninterested in the subject, he kicks his chair back, thrusts his\r\nhands way to the elbows in his trouser pockets and strides up and\r\ndown the room. With deepening interest he speaks more rapidly and\r\nforcibly, and charges back and forth across the carpet with the\r\nheavy tread of a grenadier.\" As an older man this impetuosity was\r\nsomewhat modified. What an early interviewer called his \"frank\r\nman-to-manness\" became a manner of grave and cordial\r\nconcentration. With the warm, full grasp of his hand in greeting,\r\nhe gave his complete attention to the man before him. That, and\r\nhis rich, strong laugh of pleasure, and the varied play of his\r\nmoods of earnestness, gayety, and challenge, are what men remember\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nLane's native bent from the first was toward public life. His\r\ncitizenship was determined when his father decided to take his\r\nfamily to California, to escape the severity of the Canadian\r\nclimate. In 1902, Franklin Lane was asked how he became an\r\nAmerican. \"By virtue of my father's citizenship,\" he replied, \"I\r\nhave been a resident of California since seven years of age,\r\nexcepting during a brief absence in New York and Washington.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1871, the mother, father, and four children, after visiting two\r\nbrothers of Mrs. Lane's on the way, finally reached the town of\r\nNapa, California.\r\n\r\n\"They came,\" says an old schoolmate of Napa days, \"bringing with\r\nthem enough of the appearance and mannerisms of their former\r\nenvironment to make us youngsters 'sit up and take notice,' for\r\nthe children were dressed in kilts, topped by handsome black\r\nvelvet and silk plaid caps. However, these costumes were soon\r\ndiscarded, for at school the children found themselves the center\r\nof both good--and bad-natured gibes, until they were glad to dress\r\nas was the custom here.\" The \"Lane boys,\" he says, were then put\r\ninto knee-trousers, \"and Franklin, who was large for his age and\r\nquite stout, looked already too old for this style,\" and so\r\ncontinued to be annoyed by the children, until he put a forcible\r\nend to it. \"He 'licked' one of the ringleaders,\" says the\r\nchronicler, and won to peace. \"As we grew to know Franklin ... his\r\nright to act became accepted ... . There was always something\r\nabout his personality which made one feel his importance.\"\r\n\r\nThe little California community was impressed by the close\r\nintimacy of the home-life of the Canadian family--closer than was\r\nusual in hurriedly settled Western towns. The father found time to\r\ntake all three boys on daily walks. Another companion remembers\r\nseeing them starting off together for a day's hunting and fishing.\r\nBut it was the mother, who read aloud to them and told them\r\nstories and exacted quick obedience from them, who was the real\r\npower in the house. There were regular family prayers, and family\r\nsinging of hymns and songs.\r\n\r\nThis last custom survived among the brothers and sister through\r\nall the years. Even after all had families of their own, and many\r\ncares, some chance reunion, or a little family dinner would, at\r\nparting, quicken memory and, with hats and coats already on,\r\nperhaps, in readiness to separate to their homes, they would stand\r\ntogether and shout, in unison, some song of the hour or some of\r\ntheir old Scotch melodies with that pleasant harmony of voices of\r\none timbre, heard only in family singing.\r\n\r\nLane had a baritone of stirring quality, coming straight from his\r\nbig lungs, and loved music all his life. In the last weeks of his\r\nlife he more than once wrote of his pleasure in his brother's\r\nsinging. At Rochester, a few days before his operation, he\r\nreassured an anxious friend by writing, \"My brother George is\r\nhere, with his splendid philosophy and his Scotch songs.\"\r\n\r\nHis love and loyalty to past ties, though great and persistent,\r\nstill left his ideal of loyalty unsatisfied. Toward the end of his\r\nlife he wrote, \"Roots we all have and we must not be torn up from\r\nthem and flung about as if we were young things that could take\r\nhold in any soil. I have been--America has been--too indifferent\r\nto roots--home roots, school roots. ... We should love stability\r\nand tradition as well as love adventure and advancement.\" But the\r\npractical labors of his life were directed toward creating means\r\nto modify tradition in favor of a larger sort of justice than the\r\npast had known.\r\n\r\nResignation had no part in his political creed. \"I hold with old\r\nCicero 'that the whole glory of virtue is in activity,'\" comes\r\nfrom him with the ring of authentic temperament. And of a friend's\r\nbiography he wrote, \"What a fine life--all fight, interwoven with\r\nfun and friendship.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: FRANKLIN K. LANE WITH HIS YOUNGER\r\nBROTHERS, GEORGE AND FREDERIC]\r\n\r\nAll the anecdotes of his boyhood show him in action, moving among\r\nhis fellows, organizing, leading, and administering rough-and-\r\ntumble justice.\r\n\r\nFrom grammar school in Napa he went, for a time, to a private\r\nschool called Oak Mound. In vacation, when he was eleven years\r\nold, he was earning money as messenger-boy, and at about that\r\ntime as general helper to one of the merchants of the little town.\r\nHe left in his old employer's mind the memory of a boy\r\n\"exceedingly bright and enterprising.\" He recalls a fight that he\r\nwas told about, between Lane \"and a boy of about his size,\" \"and\r\nFrank licked him,\" the old merchant exults, \"and as he walked away\r\nhe said, 'If you want any more, you can get it at the same\r\nplace.'\"\r\n\r\nIt was in Napa--so he could not have been quite twelve years old--\r\nthat Lane started to study Spanish, so that he might talk more\r\nfreely to the ranchers, who drove to town in their rickety little\r\ncarts, to \"trade\" at the stores.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, the family moved from the full sunshine of the valley\r\ntown, with its roads muffled in pale dust, and its hillsides\r\nlifting up the green of riotous vines, to Oakland, cool and\r\ncloudy, with a climate to create and sustain vigor. In Oakland,\r\njust across the bay from San Francisco, Lane entered the High\r\nSchool. Again his schoolmates recall him with gusto. He was\r\nmuscular in build, \"a good short-distance runner.\" His hands--\r\nalways very characteristic of the man--were large and well-made,\r\nstrong to grasp but not adroit in the smaller crafts of tinkering.\r\n\"He impressed me,\" an Oakland schoolmate writes, \"as a sturdy\r\nyoungster who had confidence in himself and would undoubtedly get\r\nwhat he went after. Earnest and straightforward in manner,\" and\r\nalways engrossed in the other boys, \"when they walked down Twelfth\r\nStreet, on their way to school, they had their arms around each\r\nother's shoulders, discussing subjects of 'vast importance.'\"\r\n\r\nHis capacity for organized association developed rapidly. He had\r\npart in school orations, amateur plays, school and Sunday school\r\nclubs. Many of these he seems to have initiated, so that, with his\r\nschool work, his life was full. He says somewhere that by the time\r\nhe was sixteen he was earning his own way. His great delight in\r\npeople, and especially in the thrust and parry of controversial\r\ntalk, held him from the solitary pleasures of fishing and hunting,\r\nso keenly relished by his two younger brothers. One of them said\r\nof him, \"Frank can't even enjoy a view from a mountain-peak\r\nwithout wanting to call some one up to share it with him.\" He\r\nwrites of his feeling about solitary nature to his friend George\r\nDorr, in 1917, in connection with improvements for the new\r\nNational Park, near Bar Harbor, \"A wilderness, no matter how\r\nimpressive or beautiful does not satisfy this soul of mine (if I\r\nhave that kind of a thing). It is a challenge to man. It says,\r\n'Master me! Put me to use! Make me more than I am!'\" About his\r\n\"need of a world of men,\" he was equally candid. To his wife he\r\nwrites, \"I am going to dinner, and before I go alone into a\r\nlonesome club, I must send a word to you. ... The world is all\r\npeople to me. I lean upon them. They induce thought and fancy.\r\nThey give color to my life. Thrown on myself I am a stranded\r\nbark.\"...\r\n\r\nHis love for cooperation and for action, \"dramatic action,\" some\r\none says, never left him. In his last illness, in apolitical\r\ncrisis, he rallied the energy of younger men. He wrote of the need\r\nof a Democratic program, suggested a group of compelling names,\r\n\"or any other group,\" he adds, \"put up the plan and ask them what\r\nthey think of it--tentatively--just a quiet chat, but START!\" And\r\nabout the same matter he wrote, \"The time has come. Now strike!\"\r\n\r\nTo a friend wavering over her fitness for a piece of projected\r\nwork, he said drily, \"There is only one way to do a thing, and\r\nthat is to do it.\" Late in life, the summation of this creed of\r\naction seemed to come when he confessed, \"I cannot get over the\r\nfeeling that we are here as conquerors, not as pacifists.\"\r\n\r\nAnd words, written and spoken words, were to him, of course, the\r\ninstrument of conquest. But the search for the fit and shining\r\nword for his mark did not become research. In a droll letter,\r\nabout how he put simpler English into the Department of the\r\nInterior, he tells of finding a letter written by one of the\r\nlawyers of the Department to an Indian about his title to land,\r\nthat was \"so involved and elaborately braided and beaded and\r\nfringed that I could not understand it myself.\" So he sent the\r\nornate letter back and had it put into \"straightaway English.\"\r\n\r\nHis own practicable English he believed he had learned through his\r\nnewspaper training. He first worked in the printing office of the\r\nOakland Times, then became a reporter for that paper. He went\r\ncampaigning and made speeches for the Prohibition candidate for\r\nGovernor in 1884--before he was twenty-one. The next year he was\r\nreporting for the Alta California, edited by Colonel John P.\r\nIrish, himself a fiery orator, of the denunciatory type. Colonel\r\nIrish recalls that he was at once impressed with the \"copious and\r\nexcellent vocabulary\" of his ambitious reporter, who was, even\r\nthen, he says, \"determined upon a high and useful career.\" In a\r\nletter to Colonel Irish, in 1913, Lane wrote, \"That simple little\r\ncard of yours was a good thing for me. It took me for a minute out\r\nof the maelstrom of pressing business and carried me back, about\r\nthirty years, to the time when I was a boy working for you--an\r\nunbaked, ambitious chap, who did not know where he was going, but\r\nwas trying to get somewhere.\"\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that in youth he did not suffer from\r\nthe usual phases of revolt from early teachings. His father was a\r\nProhibitionist, and Lane's first campaign was for a Prohibition\r\ncandidate for Governor; his father had been a preacher and Lane,\r\nwhen very young, thought seriously of becoming a minister, so\r\nseriously that he came before an examining board of the\r\nPresbyterian church. After two hours of grilling, he was, though\r\nfound wanting, not rejected, but put upon a six months' probation\r\n--the elders probably dreaded to lose so persuasive a tongue for\r\nthe sake of a little \"insufficiency of damnation\" in his creed.\r\nOne of his inquisitors, a Presbyterian minister, went from the\r\nordeal with Lane, and continued to try to convert him to the\r\ntenets of Presbyterianism. Then suddenly, at some turn of the\r\ntalk, the clergyman abandoned his position and said carelessly,\r\n\"Well, Lane, why not become a Unitarian preacher?\"\r\n\r\nThe boy who had been walking the floor at night in the struggle to\r\nreconcile the teachings of the church with his own doubts--knowing\r\nthat Eternal Damnation was held to be the reward for doubt of\r\nChrist's divinity--was so horrified by the casuistry of the man\r\nwho could be an orthodox minister and yet speak of preaching as\r\njust one way to make a living, that he swung sharply from any wish\r\nto enter the church.\r\n\r\nThe strictness of the orthodoxy of his home had not served to\r\nalienate his sympathies, but he was chilled to the heart by this\r\nindifference. He remembered the episode all his life with emotion,\r\nbut he was not embittered by it. He was young, a great lover,\r\ngreatly in love with life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: FRANKLIN K. LANE AT EIGHTEEN]\r\n\r\nIn 1884, when he entered the University of California, it was as a\r\nspecial not as a regular student. \"I put myself through college,\"\r\nhe writes to a boy seeking advice on education, \"by working during\r\nvacation and after hours, and I am very glad I did it.\" He seems\r\nto have arranged all his college courses for the mornings and\r\ncarried his reporting and printing-office work the last half of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nCollege at once offered a great forum for debate, and a richer\r\ncomradeship with men of strong mental fiber. Lane's eagerness in\r\ndiscussion and love of large and sounding words made the students\r\ncall him \"Demosthenes Lane.\" In his letters it is easy to trace\r\nthe gradual evolution from his early oratorical style into a final\r\nform of free, imaginative expression of great simplicity.\r\nMeanwhile, as he debated, he gathered to himself men who were to\r\nbe friends for the rest of his life. The \"Sid\" of the earliest\r\nletters that we have is Dr. Sidney E. Mezes, now President of the\r\nCollege of the City of New York, to whom one of his last letters\r\nwas addressed. His friendship for Dr. Wigmore, Dean of Law at the\r\nNorthwestern University, in Chicago, dates almost as far back.\r\n\r\nIn college, Lane seized what he most wanted in courses on\r\nPhilosophy and Economics. \"His was a mind of many facets and\r\nhospitable in its interest,\" says his college and lifelong friend,\r\nAdolph C. Miller, \"but his years at Berkeley were devoted mainly\r\nto the study of Philosophy and Government, and kindred subjects.\r\nHe was a leading figure in the Political Science Club, and intent\r\nin his pursuit of philosophy. Often he could be seen walking back\r\nand forth in a room in the old Bacon library, set apart for the\r\nmore serious-minded students, with some philosophical book in\r\nhand; every line of his face expressing deep concentration, the\r\noccasional light in his eye clearly betraying the moment when he\r\nwas feeling the joy of understanding.\"\r\n\r\nIn two years, not waiting for formal graduation, Lane was back in\r\nthe world of public affairs that he had scarcely left. In the same\r\nshort-cut way he took his Hastings Law School work, and passed his\r\nSupreme Court examination in 1888, in much less than the time\r\nusually allowed for the work.\r\n\r\nBy the time he left the law school, \"a full fledged, but not a\r\nflying attorney,\" his desire for aggressive citizenship was fully\r\nformed. In fact, the whole active campaign, that was his life, was\r\nmade by the light of early ideals, enlarged and reinterpreted as\r\nhis climb to power brought under his survey wider horizons.\r\n\r\nThe sketchiest summary of his early and late activities brings out\r\nthe singleness of the central purpose moving through his life. His\r\nfirst fight, in 1888, for Ballot Reform was made that the will of\r\nthe people of the State might be honestly interpreted; later, in\r\nTacoma, Washington, he sided with his printers, against his\r\ninterest as owner, in their fight to maintain union wages; once\r\nmore in San Francisco, he took, without a retaining fee, the case\r\nof the blackmailed householders whose titles were threatened by\r\nthe pretensions of the Noe claimants, and with his brother,\r\ncleared title to all of their small homes; he joined, with his\r\nfriend, Arthur McEwen, in an editorial campaign against the\r\nSouthern Pacific, in the day of its tyrannous power over all the\r\nshippers of California; later he drafted into the charter of San\r\nFrancisco new provisions to improve the wages of all city\r\nemployees; as its young city and county attorney, he aggressively\r\nprotected the city against street railway encroachments,\r\nsuccessfully enforcing the law against infractions; as Interstate\r\nCommerce Commissioner, he disentangled a network of injustices in\r\nthe relations between shippers and railroads, exposed rebating and\r\ndemurrage evils; formulated new procedures in deflating,\r\nreorganizing, and zoning the business of all the express companies\r\nin the country; as Secretary of the Interior, he confirmed to the\r\npeople a fuller use of Federal Lands, and National Park Reserves,\r\nlaid the foundation for the development, on public domain, of\r\nwater powers, and the leasing of Government oil lands, and built\r\nthe Government railroad in Alaska; during the War, he contributed\r\nto the Council of National Defense his inexhaustible enthusiasm\r\nfor cooperation, with definite plans for swift action, to focus\r\nNational resources to meet war needs; and finally, his last\r\ncarefully elaborated plan--killed by a partisan Congress--was to\r\nplace returned soldiers upon the land under conditions of hopeful\r\nand decent independence. These were some of the \"glories\" of\r\nactivity into which he poured the resources of his energy and\r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nBut no catalogue of the work or the salient mental characteristics\r\nof Franklin Lane gives a picture of the man, without taking into\r\naccount his temperament, for that colored every hour of his life,\r\nand every act of his career. The things that he knew seized his\r\nimagination. Even when a middle-aged man he sang, like a\r\ntroubadour, of the fertility of the soil; he was stirred by the\r\nvirtue and energy of what he saw and touched; his heart leaped at\r\nthe thought of the power of water ready to be unlocked for man's\r\nuse--most happy in that the thing that was his he could love.\r\n\r\n\"To lose faith in the future of oil!\" he cries, in the midst of a\r\nsober statistical letter, \"Why! that is as unthinkable as to lose\r\nfaith in your hands. Oil, coal, electricity, what are these but\r\nmultiplied and more adaptable, super-serviceable hands? They may\r\ntemporarily be unemployed, but the world can't go round without\r\nthem.\" A man who feels poetry in petroleum suffers from no wistful\r\n\"desire of the moth for the star.\" To his full sense of life the\r\nmoth and the star are of one essential substance, parts of one\r\nglorious conquerable creation--and the moth just a fleck of star-\r\ndust, with silly wings.\r\n\r\nIn truth, both then and throughout most of the days of his life he\r\nwas completely oriented in this world, at home here, with his\r\nstrong feet planted upon reality. He liked so many homely things,\r\nthat his friendly glance responded to common sunlight without\r\nastigmatism.\r\n\r\nThat his sympathies should have outrun his repugnances was of\r\ngreat practical moment in what he was able to achieve in a life\r\nshortened at both ends, for though he had to lose time by earning\r\nhis own professional equipment, he lost little energy in friction.\r\nHe wrote to a political aspirant for high office, in 1921, \"Pick a\r\nfew enemies and pick them with discretion. Chiefly be FOR things.\"\r\nTo a man who was making a personal attack on an adversary of\r\nLane's, while in 1914, as Secretary of the Interior, he was\r\nengrossed in establishing his \"conservation-by-use\" policy, in\r\nopposition to the older and narrower policy of conservation by\r\nwithdrawal, Lane wrote, \"I have never seen any good come by\r\nblurring an issue by personal conflict or antagonisms. ... I have\r\nno time to waste in fighting people ... to fight for a thing the\r\nbest way is to show its advantages, and the need for it ... and my\r\nonly solicitude is that the things I care for should not be held\r\nback by personal disputes.\" ...\r\n\r\nThis lesson he had learned more from his own temperament than from\r\npolitical expediency. It was bound up in his love of efficiency\r\nand also in his sense of humor. During this same hot conservation\r\ncontroversy he writes to an old friend, \"I have no intention of\r\nsaying anything in reply to Pinchot. He wrote me thirty pages to\r\nprove that I was a liar, and rather than read that again I will\r\nadmit the fact.\"\r\n\r\nThis preoccupation with the main issue, in getting beneficial\r\nresults was one thing that made him glad to acclaim and use the\r\ngifts of other men. Through his sympathies he could follow as well\r\nas lead, and he caught enthusiasms as well as kindled them. He\r\nbelieved in enthusiasm for itself, and because he saw in it one of\r\nthe great potencies of life. In writing of D'Annunzio's placing\r\nItaly beside the Allies, he rejoices in the beautiful spectacle of\r\nthe spirit of a whole people \"blown into flame by a poet-patriot.\"\r\nBut \"the ideal,\" he urges, \"must be translated into the possible.\r\nMan cannot live by bread alone--nor on manna.\"\r\n\r\nHis gay and challenging attitude toward life expressed only one\r\nmood, for he paid, as men must, for intense buoyancy of temper by\r\nblack despairs. \"Damn that Irish temperament, anyway!\" he writes.\r\n\"O God, that I had been made a stolid, phlegmatic, non-nervous,\r\nself-satisfied Britisher, instead of a wild cross between a crazy\r\nIrishman with dreams, desires, fancies--and a dour Scot with his\r\nconscience and his logical bitterness against himself--and his\r\neternal drive!\"\r\n\r\nHis exaggerations of hope and his moods of broken disappointment,\r\nhis ever-springing faith in men, and in the possibility of just\r\ninstitutions, were more temperamental than logical. Moods of\r\nastonished grief, when men showed greed and instability, gave\r\nplace to humorous and tolerant analysis of characters and events.\r\nEven his loyalty to his friends was subject to the slight magnetic\r\ndeflections of a man of moods. He was true to them as the needle\r\nto the pole; and with just the same piquing oscillations, before\r\nthe needle comes to rest at the inevitable North.\r\n\r\nBecause he had caught, in its capricious rhythms, the subtle\r\nmovements of human intercourse he trusted himself to express to\r\nother men the natural man within his breast, without fear of\r\nmisconstruction. He contrived to humanize, in parts, even his\r\ngovernment reports. They brought him, year by year, touching\r\nletters of gratitude from weary political writers. The patient,\r\nlogical Scot in him that said, \"I am going to take this thing up\r\nbit by bit without trying to get a whole philosophy into the\r\nwork,\" anchored him to the heaviest tasks as if he were a true-\r\nborn plodder, while the \"wild Irishman\" with dreams and desires\r\nlighted the way with gleams of Will-o'-the-Wisp. The quicksilver\r\nin the veins of the patient Mercutio of railroad rates and\r\ndemurrage charges lightened his work for himself and others. Just\r\nas in the five years when he served San Francisco, as City and\r\nCounty Attorney, he labored to such effect that not one of his\r\nhundreds of legal opinions was reversed by the Supreme Court of\r\nthe State, so he toiled on these same Annual Reports, so immersed\r\nthat, as he says, \"I even have to take the blamed stuff to bed\r\nwith me.\" Fourteen and sixteen hours at his official desk were not\r\nhis longest hours, and sometimes he snatched a dinner of shredded\r\nbiscuit from beside the day's accumulations of papers upon his\r\nheaped-up desk. He laid upon himself the burden of labor,\r\nexamining and cross-examining men for hours upon a single point of\r\nessential fact--quick to detect fraud and intolerant of humbug,--\r\nbut infinitely patient with those who were merely dull, evading no\r\ndrudgery, and, above all, never evading the dear pains of\r\nbuilding-up and maintaining friendship.\r\n\r\nLOUISE HERRICK WALL\r\n\r\nMARCH, 1922\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nPOLITICS AND JOURNALISM\r\n\r\n1884-1894\r\n\r\nPOLITICS--NEWSPAPER WORK--NEW YORK--BUYING INTO TACOMA NEWS--\r\nMARRIAGE--SALE OF NEWSPAPER\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE'S earliest political association, in California,\r\nafter reaching manhood, was with John H. Wigmore. Wigmore had\r\nreturned from Harvard, in 1883, with a plan, already matured, for\r\nCivic Reform. The Municipal Reform League, created by Wigmore,\r\nLane, and several other young men, was to follow the general\r\noutline of boss control, by precinct and ward organization, the\r\ndifference being that the League members were to hold no offices,\r\nenjoy no spoils, and work for clean city politics. Each member of\r\nthe inner circle was to take over and make himself responsible for\r\na definite city district, making a card index of the name of each\r\nvoter, taking a real part in all caucus meetings--in saloon\r\nparlors or wherever they were held--and studying practical\r\npolitics at first hand. \"Blind Boss Buckley\" was the Democratic\r\ndictator of San Francisco, and against his regime the initial\r\nefforts of the League were directed.\r\n\r\nIt was a giant's task, an impossible task, for a small group of\r\nnewspaper writers and college undergraduates. The short career of\r\nthe Municipal Reform League ended when Wigmore went East to study\r\nlaw, leaving Lane determined to increase his efficiency by earning\r\nhis way through college and the Hastings Law School.\r\n\r\nThe first letters of this volume follow the theme of the political\r\ninterests of the two young men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. WIGMORE\r\n\r\nOakland, February 27, 1888\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WIGMORE,--I am thinking of getting back in your part of\r\nthe world myself, and this is what I especially wanted to write\r\nyou about. I desire to see the world, to rub off some of my\r\nprovincialisms, to broaden a little before I settle down to a\r\nprosaic existence. So, as I say, I want to live in Boston awhile\r\nand my only possibility of so doing is to get a position on some\r\nBoston paper, something that will afford me a living and allow\r\nsome little time for social and literary life. However I don't\r\ncare much what the billet is. I can bring letters of\r\nrecommendation from all the good newspaper men in San Francisco,\r\nboth as to my ability at editorial work (I have done considerable\r\nfor the San Francisco NEWS LETTER and EXAMINER), and at all kinds\r\nof reportorial work. ...\r\n\r\nI passed the law examination before the Supreme Court last month,\r\nso I am now a full-fledged--but not a flying, attorney. I have not\r\ndetermined definitely on going into law. ...\r\n\r\nPolitically speaking we Mugwumps out here are happy. ...\r\nCalifornia has been opposed to Cleveland on every one of his great\r\nproposals (civil service reform, silver question, tariff reform),\r\nand yet the Republicans must nominate a very strong man to get\r\nthis State this year. The people admire old Grover's strength so\r\nmuch, he is a positive man and an honest man, and when the people\r\nsee these two exceptional virtues mixed happily in a candidate\r\nthey grow to love and admire him out of the very idealism of their\r\nnatures.\r\n\r\nBut I must not bother the Boston attorney any longer. Write me all\r\nyou know of opportunities there and believe me always your friend,\r\n\r\nFRANK K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN B. WIGMORE\r\n\r\nOakland, May 9, 1888\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WIGMORE,--Of course I would have to stand my chances in\r\ngetting a position. Newspaper men, perhaps more than any other\r\nclass, are rated by ability. Civil Service Reform principles rule\r\nin every good newspaper office to their fullest extent. When I\r\nwrote you, I was unsettled as to my plans for the coming year. My\r\nbrother desired to spend a year or so in Boston and I thought of\r\naccompanying him. He has changed his plans and so have I. ... I am\r\nregularly on the Chronicle staff, chiefly writing sensational\r\nstories. I get a regular salary of twenty-five dollars a week\r\nbesides some extras, and have as easy and pleasant a billet as\r\nthere is on the paper, though editorial work would be more to my\r\nliking.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements do not interfere, however, with my Boston plan,\r\nfor sooner or later I shall breathe its intellectual atmosphere,\r\nthat I may outgrow provincialism and become intellectual by force\r\nof habit rather than will. How long it will be before the wish can\r\nbe gratified I cannot tell. Probably next year. You see the law is\r\nnot altogether after my taste. I feel it a waste of time to spend\r\ndays quarreling like school-boys over a few hundred dollars. I\r\nfeel all the time as if I must be engaged in some life work which\r\nwill make more directly for the good of my fellows. I feel the\r\nneed which the world manifests for broader ideas in economics,\r\npolitics, the philosophy of life, and all social questions.\r\nFeeling so, I cannot coop myself in a law library behind a pile of\r\nbriefs, spending my days and nights in search of some authority\r\nwhich will save my client's dollar. I am unsettled, however, as to\r\nmy permanent work. ...\r\n\r\nOakland, September 20, 1888\r\n\r\n... The copies of the Massachusetts law have been duly received\r\nand put to the best of use. On my motion our Young Men's League\r\nappointed a Committee to draft a law for presentation to the\r\nLegislature. Judge Maguire, Ferd, [Footnote: Ferdinand Vassault, a\r\ncollege friend. ] and two others, with myself, are on that\r\nCommittee and we are hard at work. I send to-day a copy of the\r\nExaminer containing a ballot reform bill just introduced by the\r\nFederated Trades. It is based on the New York law but is very\r\nfaulty. We are working with that bill as a basis, proposing\r\nvarious and very necessary amendments. We hope to get our bill\r\nadopted in Committee as a substitute for the one introduced, and\r\nbelieve that the Federated Trades will be perfectly willing to\r\nadopt our measure. ...\r\n\r\nTell me, please, how you select your election officials in your\r\nlarge cities. Our mode of selection is really the weak point with\r\nus, for no matter how good a law we might procure, its enforcement\r\nwould be left to \"boss\" tools--corruptionists of the worst\r\nclass. ...\r\n\r\nOakland, December 2, 1888\r\n\r\n... Your letter breathes the sentiments of thousands of\r\nRepublicans who voted against Cleveland. They are now \"just a\r\nlittle\" sorry that so good a man is beaten. I never quite\r\nunderstood your political position. Your letter to Ferd giving\r\nyour reason was, I must say, not conclusive, for I cannot believe\r\nthat you can find a greater field of usefulness or power in the\r\nRepublican than in the Democratic party, surely not now that the\r\nnew Democracy--a party aggressive, filled with the reform spirit,\r\nand right in the direction it takes, now that such a party is in\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nYou surely ought to join us on the tariff fight, but then I wish\r\nyou the best of fortune whatever your choice. Ferd and several\r\nothers with myself are now organizing what will some day be a\r\ngreat state, if not a great national institution. We call it the\r\nYoung Men's Democratic League [Footnote: This plan seems to have\r\nbeen to enlarge the influence of the League mentioned in a former\r\nletter.]--it is to be made up of young men from twenty-one to\r\nforty-five; its scope--national politics, election of President\r\nand Congressmen, and its immediate purpose to inform the people on\r\nthe tariff question. When our Constitution is published you shall\r\nhave one. We expect to organize branches all over the State and in\r\na year or two will be strong in the thousands.\r\n\r\nYour election article was of a singular kind but VERY good. I have\r\nloaned it out among the old crowd. I spoke of it to Judge\r\nSullivan, who is compiling authorities on the \"intention of the\r\nvoter\" as governing, where the spelling is wrong on a ballot.\r\nSullivan ran for Supreme Justice and ran thousands ahead of his\r\nticket (the Democratic) but thinks that he was defeated by votes\r\nthrown out in Alameda and Los Angeles counties because of\r\nirregularities in the ballot--in one case his initials were\r\nprinted \"J. D.\" instead of \"J, F.\"--in another instance, his name\r\nwas printed a little below the title of the office, because of the\r\nnarrowness of the ticket. If these ballots were counted for him he\r\nthinks he would have won. ...\r\n\r\nFourteen years later, when the electoral count was made of\r\nFranklin K. Lane's ballots for Governor of the State of\r\nCalifornia, between eight and ten thousand ballots were thrown out\r\non similar ground of \"irregularities,\" and he was counted out,\r\n\"the intention of the voter\" being again frustrated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, California, January 29, 1889\r\n\r\nMy dear Wigmore,-- ... I want to report progress. We now have our\r\nbill complete. ... The bill I send has been adopted by the\r\nFederated Trades and will be substituted by them for their bill\r\nnow before the House. ...\r\n\r\nOn Saturday evening there will be one of those huge \"spontaneous\"\r\nmass meetings (which require so much preparation) in support and\r\nendorsement of the bill. The most prominent men in both Houses of\r\nthe Legislature will speak. ...\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, February 17, 1889\r\n\r\n... I never have been busier in my life than in the last two\r\nweeks. Ballot Reform has taken up a very great portion of my time.\r\nI have just returned from a lobbying trip to Sacramento. The bill\r\nwill not pass, though the best men in both Houses favor it. I went\r\nup on the invitation of the chairman of the Assembly Committee to\r\naddress the Committee. I spoke for an hour and a half. At the end\r\nof that time only one man in the group openly opposed the scheme,\r\nand he confessed that the bill would do just what I claimed for\r\nit, and made this confession to the Committee. \"But,\" said he, \"it\r\ntends to the disintegration of political parties and as they are\r\nessential to our life we must not help on their destruction.\" ...\r\n\r\nThe Committee of the Senate decided without any debate on the bill\r\nto report adversely to it. I got them to reconsider their vote,\r\nand we will have a hearing at any rate before the bill is killed.\r\nThe Legislature is altogether for boodle. ...\r\n\r\nYour book has been of the greatest assistance to me. I virtually\r\nmade my speech from it and left the book with the chairman of the\r\nCommittee at his special request. ... If it had come out a month\r\nsooner we would have stood fifty per cent better chance of getting\r\nthe bill through, because the papers would have come to the front\r\nso much sooner and we would have been thirty days ahead with our\r\nbill. I tell you I felt quite proud in addressing the\r\ndistinguished legislature to refer to \"my friend Wigmore's book.\"\r\n...\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, May 10, 1889\r\n\r\n... I am coming nearer to you. On Monday I leave to take up my\r\nresidence in New York, as correspondent for the San Francisco\r\nChronicle. I do not know where I will be located, but mail\r\naddressed to me at the Hoffman House will reach me when I arrive,\r\nwhich will be in about ten days.\r\n\r\nMy purpose is to breathe a new atmosphere for a while so that I\r\nmay broaden. We must make arrangements soon to meet. I want to\r\nknow your New York reform friends. ...\r\n\r\nNew York, June 21, 1889\r\n\r\n... This lapse of a couple of weeks means that I have been\r\nenjoying the delights of a New York summer, in which only slaves\r\nwork and many of these find refuge in suicide. ...\r\n\r\nNot a single reformer, big or little, have I yet met. Your friend\r\nBishop [Footnote: Joseph Bucklin Bishop, editor of Theodore\r\nRoosevelt and His Time.] I have not called on, though I have twice\r\nstarted to do so, and have been switched off. ... I will go within\r\na couple of days for the spirit must be revived. One day early in\r\nthis week I had an intense desire to visit you immediately and was\r\nalmost on the verge of letting things go and rush off, but duty\r\nheld me. ...\r\n\r\nI see that Bellamy has captured Higginson, Savage, and others and\r\nthat they are going to work over the Kinsley-Maurice business.\r\nWell, I would to God it would work. Something to make life happier\r\nand steadier for these poor women and men who toil and never get\r\nbeyond a piece of meat and a cot! There is justification here for\r\na social-economic revolution and it will come, too, if things are\r\nnot bettered.\r\n\r\nIf you have a stray thought let me know it and soon.\r\n\r\nYour friend,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nLane's desire for stimulating companionship in New York was\r\nquickly gratified. A spontaneous association of friendships, based\r\nupon a young delight in life and a vast curiosity of the mind,\r\nsprang up among a little group of men of very diverse types. All\r\nwere strangers in New York with no immediate home ties. \"Women\r\nplayed no part in our lives,\" one of them recalls. \"We came\r\ntogether to discuss plays, poetry, politics, anything and\r\neverything--the great actors, comic operas, the songs of the\r\nstreets, science, politics.\" John Crawford Burns, Lane, Brydon\r\nLamb, Curt Pfeiffer formed the nucleus of what spread out\r\nirregularly into larger groupings.\r\n\r\nJohn Crawford Burns, who was slightly older than the rest, a\r\npurist, and something of a \"dour Scot,\" was a man of conservative\r\nand cultivated tastes and the dean of the group. He was in a\r\nbusiness house that imported linens, and lived in a \"glorious room\r\nwith two outside windows, and ample seating capacity,\" so the\r\nfriends often met there and learned something of Gothic\r\narchitecture and of the abominations of slang, in spite of\r\nthemselves. With Burns, and of his firm, was Brydon Lamb, \"also of\r\nScotch descent, but born in America, a delightful combination of\r\nstrength, sweetness and light. The simple grace of his manner, his\r\nunhurried speech, his urbanity, captivated us all. We loved him\r\nfor what he was, and we considered him our arbiter elegantiarum\"\r\nOf Lane at that period the same friend writes, \"I remember a fine,\r\nstocky, muscular presence with a striking head. A massive,\r\ncommanding man, he was, a persuasive and compelling leader.\" But\r\nnone of the men had any sense of anything but complete friendly,\r\nboyish equality. \"Lane was,\" Pfeiffer says, \"interested in human\r\nbeings, not problems, excepting as their solution might be made\r\nserviceable to the needs of individuals. He had great tolerance\r\nfor the most unusual opinions. I don't think Lane ever had much\r\ninterest in the dogmas of science, religion, or philosophy; he\r\nlived by the spirit of them, that cannot be expressed in formulae.\r\nHe had the peculiar sensitiveness of a poet for words, for colors\r\nand sounds, and for moral beauty, and blended with it the\r\nstatesman's observant awareness of conditions in the world of\r\naffairs.\"\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of their friendship, in 1889, Curt Pfeiffer\r\nhimself was only nineteen years old, a youth whose family had come\r\nfrom Holland and Germany. He appeared in the boarding-house on\r\n32nd near Broadway, where Burns lived, fresh from three months at\r\nthe Paris Exposition, a vacation that had followed a course of\r\nscientific study at Zurich, Switzerland. The wonders of Paris,\r\na-glitter with the blaze of undreamed-of electrical beauty, and the\r\ngreater wonder of the scientific discoveries and speculations, of\r\nthe eighties, as taught at the University of Zurich, gave the\r\nyoung traveler an instant place among the others. Because of his\r\nlove for exact statement and his scientific approach in\r\ndiscussion, young as he was, he contributed something very real to\r\nthe group whose chief preoccupation--aside from the joy of living-\r\nwas with art, government, and literature.\r\n\r\nThey read separately, and when a book seemed intolerably good to\r\nthe discoverer, he brought it in and insisted on their reading\r\nparts of it together. Browning, Darwin, the Vedic Hymns,\r\nStevenson, Taine, Buckle, Spencer, Kipling, Sir Henry Maine, on\r\nprimitive law, and Emerson! The relation of the men was almost\r\nimpersonal in the fervor of their explorations into life.\r\nDifferences of blood and tradition were not only easily bridged\r\nbut welcomed, because they assured, to the group as a whole,\r\nsharper angles of mental refraction--breaking the ray of truth\r\nthey sought into more of its component colors.\r\n\r\nPfeiffer recalls that \"one Saturday night, under the influence of\r\nreading from the Vedic Hymns, and a talk on astronomy, we went up\r\non the roof of our boarding-place, and observed a complete\r\nrevolution of the starry heavens, from dusk to dawn. We drifted\r\ninto talk, ... and when we finally descended to our beds on Sunday\r\nmorning, we found ourselves drenched to the skin from the\r\ndrizzling dew. We never forgot that experience, but we never\r\nrepeated it either.\"\r\n\r\nHis political interests brought Lane into the Reform Club where\r\nProgress and Poverty, Henry George's new book, was the center for\r\ndiscussion upon the whole problem of the distribution of taxation.\r\nLane and Henry George established a cordial friendship.\r\n\r\nJohn Crawford Burns says that in 1889 \"Lane's chief hero was\r\nCleveland, and his oracle Godkin, of the EVENING POST\"--later, the\r\nNATION. \"When I knew him in New York he represented a San\r\nFrancisco newspaper, the CHRONICLE, I think, as correspondent. He\r\nwas not whole-heartedly in sympathy with his proprietor, nor\r\nindeed with the sensational aspect of journalism, and he always\r\nscoffed at the idea of newspaper writers constituting a modern\r\npriesthood. He laughingly justified his association with the\r\nCHRONICLE by saying he gave tone to it. For this and other\r\nservices, he received, I think, two thousand dollars a year, which\r\neven thirty years ago did not admit of luxury and riotous living.\"\r\n\r\nLane's whole stay in New York was less than two years in length,\r\nbut the vital ideas that he shared with disinterested minds made\r\nof this period the seed-bed for future intellectual growth.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, in spite of the delights of personal friendships, in New\r\nYork, Lane grew increasingly dissatisfied with the limitations of\r\nnewspaper corresponding. He wanted a paper of his own, in which he\r\ncould express without reserve the ideals of social and political\r\nbetterment with which his mind was teeming. In this mood, the\r\nfirst acclaim of the rapid growth of the pioneer towns of the far\r\nNorthwest reached him. He saw in this his opportunity, and acted\r\nquickly and decisively. He gathered together his own savings,\r\nborrowed from his friend, Sidney Mezes, a few more thousand\r\ndollars and went to Tacoma, Washington, to buy the Tacoma Evening\r\nNews.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the transfer was well made, Lane threw himself\r\nenthusiastically into the politics of the new town, already\r\nsuffering from boss rule. By his editorials he succeeded in\r\nstirring up the City Hall, and drove into Alaskan exile the Chief\r\nof Police--who, by the way, was said to have become immensely rich\r\nin Alaska while Lane's paper was running into bankruptcy in\r\nTacoma. But Lane's misadventure was not wholly due to his civic\r\nvirtue. He had \"bought in\" at just the moment when the instruments\r\nwere tuning up for the prelude to the great panic crash of 1893.\r\nTacoma, and the whole Northwest, had been mainly developed by\r\ncasual investments of speculative Eastern capital, and this\r\ncapital, sensitive to change, was being withdrawn to meet home\r\nneeds. Investors, to protect real interests, were willing to\r\nsacrifice their \"little Western flyers,\" at almost any discount.\r\n\r\nAs the terminal of the new Northern Pacific Railroad, Tacoma--\r\nlying on the bluffs overlooking the great inland sea of Puget\r\nSound, guardianed by the vastness of its mountain--was backed by\r\nforests whose wealth could scarcely be exaggerated, even by\r\npromoter's advertisements. She was noisily proclaimed to be the\r\n\"Gateway to the Orient,\" but trade was not yet firmly established\r\nwith the Orient, and, indeed, what was Washington's wealth of\r\nuncut timber when the capital to develop it was slowly ebbing\r\nEastward?\r\n\r\nNo paper without heavy capitalization, could have sustained a\r\npolicy of political reform, when, in the picturesque vernacular of\r\nthe time and place, \"the bottom had dropped out of the town.\" A\r\nrival newspaper, the LEDGER, in order to retrench, began a war on\r\nthe Printers' Union, to break wages. Lane repudiated the effort\r\nmade to \"rat\" his paper and to force the Union out. He sustained\r\nhis men in their fight to keep the Union rate, and lent them his\r\npresses to carry on their propaganda. In after years he said, \"As\r\nto my labor record, it is a consistent one of thirty years length,\r\never since I stood by the Union in Tacoma, and went broke.\" Again\r\nhe wrote to an acquaintance, \"I often think of the old days in\r\nTacoma. We were a fighting bunch, and I think most of us are\r\nfighting for the same things that we fought for then; a little bit\r\nmore decency and less graft in affairs, and a chance for a man to\r\nrise by ability and not by pull alone.\"\r\n\r\nIn April, 1893, Lane had married Anne Wintermute--he needed all\r\nhe could find of cheer in those depressing days. The whole town\r\nwas beaten to its knees by loss and fore-closure. Lane was\r\nstruggling to hold together his paper, and save his friend's\r\ninvestment and his own little stake. The one bright interlude of\r\nthat time for him lay in reading, and in his new friendships. He\r\nloved to chant aloud to a group of stranded young fellows gathered\r\nin his rooms, in his gay trumpeting way, brave passages from the\r\nBarrack-Room Ballads, of Kipling, that were lifting the spirits\r\nof the English-speaking world with their freshness and daring.\r\nStevenson, too, with his polished optimism delighted Lane. \"I can\r\nremember,\" says one of the group, \"just how I heard him read aloud\r\nthe last words from Stevenson's essay, Aes Triplex, in those\r\nmelancholy Tacoma days--'those happy days when we were so\r\nmiserable!'\":--\r\n\r\n\"All who have meant good work with their whole hearts, have done\r\ngood work, although they may die before they have the time to sign\r\nit. ... Does not life go down with a better grace, foaming in full\r\nbody over a precipice, than miserably straggling to an end in\r\nsandy deltas? When the Greeks made their fine saying that those\r\nwhom the Gods love die young, I cannot help believing they had\r\nthis sort of death also in their eye. For surely, at whatever age\r\nit overtake the man, this is to die young. Death has not been\r\nsuffered to take so much as an illusion from his heart. In the\r\nhot-fit of life, a-tip-toe on the highest point of being, he\r\npasses at a bound on to the other side. The noise of the mallet\r\nand chisel is scarcely quenched, the trumpets are hardly done\r\nblowing, when, trailing with him clouds of glory, this happy-\r\nstarred, full-blooded spirit shoots into the spiritual land.\"\r\n\r\nStill believing in the good work he had meant with his whole\r\nheart, Lane turned from the bankruptcy of his paper, sold at\r\nauction, to write to his friend of new adventures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nTacoma, October 25, 1894\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WIGMORE,--I have not heard from you for a year. You are in\r\nmy debt at least one, and I think two, letters. I have sent you an\r\noccasional paper, just to let you know I was alive and I am\r\nhazarding this letter to the old address. ...\r\n\r\nMy affairs here have not prospered and I am thinking of going\r\nsomewhere else. ... Do you think Japan has anything to offer a\r\nman such as myself? Would there be any chance there for a\r\nnewspaper run by an American? Are there any wealthy Americans\r\nthere who would be likely to put up a few thousands for such an\r\nenterprise? ... Life is not the \"giddy, reeling dream of love and\r\nfame\" that it once was, and I have decided on gathering a few\r\nessential dollars. Now Japan may not be the place I am looking\r\nfor, ... but unless I am greatly mistaken, a man who is up on\r\nAmerican affairs and alive to business opportunities could do well\r\nin Japan. But then this is all a guess, and I want you to put me\r\nright ...\r\n\r\nYours very truly,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nLAW PRACTICE AND POLITICAL ACTIVITIES 1894-1906\r\n\r\nLaw--Drafting New City Charter--Elected as City and County\r\nAttorney--Gubernatorial Campaign--Mayoralty Campaign--Earthquake\r\n--Appointment as Interstate Commerce Commissioner\r\n\r\n\r\nLate in the fall of 1894 Lane returned to San Francisco and for\r\nsome months associated himself with Arthur McEwen, on Arthur\r\nMcEwen's Letter, a lively political weekly which attacked various\r\nforms of civic corruption in San Francisco, and made an especial\r\ntarget of the Southern Pacific Railroad, then in practical control\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\nHe also formed a law partnership with his brother, George W. Lane,\r\nunder the firm name of Lane and Lane. In 1895 a curious case,\r\nestimated as involving about sixty million dollars worth of\r\nproperty, was brought to the young attorneys. The Star, of San\r\nFrancisco, described the issue at stake by saying, \"One Jose Noe\r\nand four alleged grand-children of Jose Noe appear, who pretend\r\nthat they can show a clear title to an undivided one-half interest\r\nin nearly forty-five hundred acres within the city, on which land\r\nreside some five thousand or more owners, mostly men of small\r\nmeans.\"\r\n\r\nUpon investigation Lane and his brother became convinced that the\r\nsuit had been instituted as a blackmailing scheme, in an attempt\r\nto force the owners to pay for quit-claim deeds; they took and\r\nenergetically fought the case for the defendants, without asking\r\nfor a retainer. Their clients formed themselves into what they\r\ncalled the San Miguel Defense Association. In a year the title of\r\nthe householders to their little homes was established beyond\r\nperadventure.\r\n\r\nWith the warmth of Latin gratitude this service was remembered. In\r\n1898 when Lane ran for his first political office, as City and\r\nCounty Attorney, the San Miguel Defense Association revived its\r\nenergies, formed a Franklin K. Lane Campaign Club and sent out\r\nvivid circulars about Franklin K. Lane, \"who nobly fought for us.\r\n... It is now our turn to stand by him and see that he is elected\r\nby a very large majority.\" Their proclamation ended with the\r\nappeal, \"Vote for Franklin K. Lane, the Foe to Blackmailers.\"\r\n\r\nAs Lane's plurality in this first election was eight hundred and\r\nthirty-two votes, there is little doubt that his grateful clients\r\nplayed a real part in that success.\r\n\r\nThe Tacoma printers had also sent a testimonial, which was widely\r\ndistributed in the campaign, as to Lane's friendship to labor,\r\nsaying that they, in gratitude, had made him an honorary member of\r\ntheir Typographical Union. The campaign was made on the rights of\r\nthe plain people, for its chief issue.\r\n\r\nIn the letter that follows, Lane, in 1913, tells of his formal\r\nentry into politics, in 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo P. T. Spurgcon Herald, McClure Newspaper Syndicate\r\n\r\nWashington, December 30, 1913\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. SPURGEON,--In reply to your inquiry of December 29,\r\npermit me to say that I got into politics in this way:--\r\n\r\nOne day, while on my way to lunch, I met Mayor Phelan, of San\r\nFrancisco, who asked me if I would become a member of the\r\ncommittee to draft a charter for the city. I said I would, and was\r\nappointed. At that time I was practising law and had no idea\r\nwhatever that I would at any time run for public office, or take\r\nany considerable part in public affairs. I helped to draft the\r\ncharter, and as it had to be submitted to the people for\r\nratification, I stumped the city for it. Later, when the first\r\nelection was held under it, my friends on the charter committee\r\ninsisted that I should accept the Democratic nomination for City\r\nAttorney. Under the charter, the City Attorney was the legal\r\nadviser of all the city and county officials, and it was his\r\nbusiness to define and construe this organic law, and the friends\r\nof the charter wished some one who was in sympathy with the\r\ninstrument to give it initial construction.\r\n\r\nI was nominated by the Democratic party by an independent movement\r\nand was elected; later re-elected, and elected for a third term.\r\nAfter an unsuccessful candidacy for the governorship, I was\r\nappointed a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission by\r\nPresident Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, November 14, 1898\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WIGMORE,--This is a formal note of acknowledgment of the\r\nservice rendered me in the campaign, which has just closed\r\nsuccessfully. There were only three Democrats elected on the\r\ngeneral ticket, the Mayor, Assessor, and myself. I ran four\r\nthousand five hundred votes ahead of my ticket. It was a splendid\r\ntribute to worth! I never before realized how discriminating the\r\nAmerican public is. A man who scoffs at Democratic institutions\r\nmust be a tyrant at heart, or a defeated candidate. I tell you the\r\npeople know a good man when they see one.\r\n\r\nMy opponent was the present Attorney General of the State, W. F.\r\nFitzgerald, a very capable man, and probably the best man on the\r\nRepublican ticket. He has been steadily in office for thirty\r\nyears, in Mississippi, Arizona, and California, and this is his\r\nfirst defeat; and I sincerely regret that I had to take a fall out\r\nof such a gentleman.\r\n\r\nNow, the perplexing problem arises as to how long I shall hold\r\noffice. The term is for two years. The new charter comes up before\r\nthe coming Legislature for approval in January, and that\r\ninstrument provides for another election next fall, to fill all\r\nCity and County offices. ...\r\n\r\nI don't want to stay in politics, two years in the office will be\r\nlong enough for me. I hope that I shall make a creditable record.\r\nI can foresee that strong pressure will be brought to bear upon me\r\nto act with the Examiner in making things disagreeable for the\r\ncorporations, and I will have no easy task in gaining the approval\r\nof my own party, and of my conscience and judgment at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nLet me thank you again very earnestly for what you did, and\r\nbelieve me. Yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nThe City Charter that Lane had helped to draft, with its many new\r\nprovisions, never before adjudicated, made his first term as City\r\nand County Attorney one requiring an especial amount of laborious\r\nlegal study. To meet the pressing need, Lane organized his corps\r\nof assistants to include several men of marked legal ability and\r\nthe industry that the task demanded, appointing his brother,\r\nGeorge W. Lane, as his first assistant.\r\n\r\nIt was partly due to the good team-work of the office that his\r\nopinions rendered in four years were as \"numerous as those\r\nheretofore rendered by the department in about sixteen years,\" and\r\nthat during one of the years of his incumbency \"snot a dollar of\r\ndamages was obtained against the city.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: FRANKLIN K. LANE AS CITY AND COUNTY\r\nATTORNEY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, September 25, [1899]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WIGMORE,-- ... As an evidence of what I am doing I sent\r\nyou a brief three or four days ago in the Charter case. I have\r\nanother just filed on the question of county officers holding over\r\nunder the Charter, a third on the new primary law which is a grand\r\nthing if we can make it stick, and a fourth on the taxation of\r\nbonds of quasi-public corporations, and a fifth on the taxation of\r\nNational Bank stock.\r\n\r\nI have hardly seen my baby for six weeks; have been at the office\r\nfrom nine A.M. to eleven P.M. regularly. And now that I am nearly\r\ndead a new campaign is on and I must run again. And, of course, I\r\nhave enemies now which I hadn't last year.\r\n\r\nThank you once again for so kindly remembering me.\r\n\r\nYours sincerely,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLane's first child, a son, was born in the spring of 1898. He is\r\nthe \"Ned\" of the letters--Franklin K. Lane, Jr. Lane's attitude\r\ntoward children is shown in many of his letters. His own boy gave\r\na strong impetus to his most disinterested social ideals. In\r\nwriting of the birth of a friend's baby he said, \"For the child we\r\nact nobly, its call to us is always to our finer side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, November 10\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WIGMORE,--This is to be a mere bulletin. I am elected once\r\nagain--10,500 majority, the largest received by any candidate. You\r\nexpected me to run for Mayor I know. Well, it was offered me--the\r\nnomination, I mean--and all my campaign expenses promised. But I\r\ncouldn't accept, having told the Labor Union people that I was a\r\ncandidate for City Attorney and not for Mayor. This Labor Union\r\nParty is a new one, the outgrowth of the recent strike. They have\r\nelected their Mayor, a musician named Schmitz, a decent,\r\nconservative young man, who will surprise the decent moneyed\r\npeople and anger the laboring people with his\r\nconservatism.[Footnote: Lane lived to smile at his too charitable\r\ncharacterization of this San Francisco Mayor.] I didn't have one\r\nsingle word of praise from a newspaper in the campaign. They\r\nhardly mentioned the fact that I was a candidate. It was jolly\r\ngood therefore to win as I did.\r\n\r\nAnd my congratulations to you, my honored friend, Dean Wigmore.\r\nNext year I am to publish my Opinions, a copy of which, of course,\r\nwill go to you, but not by virtue of your office, old man. You are\r\narriving, of course, but there is something better in store. A\r\nFederal Judgeship is the thing for you; and when I get into the\r\nCabinet you shall have it. But don't wait till then. I'm gray and\r\nbald now and my boy patronizes me. So don't wait, but get your\r\nlines out, and one of these days you'll make it. Where next I\r\nshall land I don't know, probably in a law office, praying for\r\nclients. ... Always yours,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nLane's first majority in 1898 of 832 votes was increased to 10,500\r\nin 1899, when he was re-elected; and two years later he won by a\r\nstill larger majority. A number of his opinions, as City Attorney,\r\nwere collected and bound in a volume, as none of them had been\r\nreversed by the Supreme Court of the State.\r\n\r\nHe took much pleasure in a dinner club that he helped to form. The\r\nmembers were University professors, lawyers, newspaper men, and a\r\nfew business men. \"But,\" says one of them, \"in spirit they were\r\npoets, philosophers and prophets. They were aware that their\r\nsolutions of problems vexing to the brains of other men, would be\r\nUtopian, but as they were not willing to be classed with ordinary\r\nUtopians they named their club Amaurot, after the capital of\r\nUtopia, thus signifying that while they dwelt in Utopia, they were\r\nnot subject to it but were lords of it--the teachers of its wisdom\r\nand the makers of its laws.\"\r\n\r\nHis home life absorbed much of his leisure. He and his family had\r\nmoved into a modest house on Gough Street, in San Francisco, with\r\na view of the bay, Alcatraz Island, and the Marin Hills from the\r\nupstairs living-room window--for no house was a home to Lane that\r\nhad no view--and in the back-yard, among its red geraniums and\r\ncosmos bushes, he played Treasure Island and Wild West with his\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1902, Lane was nominated as the Democratic and\r\nNon-Partisan candidate for Governor of California. At the\r\nDemocratic Convention at Sacramento, an onlooker described the\r\nexcitement among the delegates before a selection was made,\r\n\"Throughout the night until late afternoon of the second day,\r\nwithout any clear solution of the problem, came the roll-call of\r\nthe counties, then a wild stampede for the young City and County\r\nAttorney of San Francisco, who was borne to the platform. ...\r\n\r\n\"It was Franklin K. Lane who stood a goodly and confident figure,\r\nwaving a palm-leaf fan for quiet. He said:--\r\n\r\n\"'I was in the rear of the hall when Governor Budd made his speech\r\nand voiced the call of the party for a winner, and, in response to\r\nhis call, I have taken this platform.'\"\r\n\r\nThis note of joyous truculence, with the little out-thrust of the\r\nunderlip, brought, as so often before and since, laughter and\r\napplause.\r\n\r\nA hot and spirited campaign followed. California is naturally\r\nRepublican, and Lane had many times challenged and attacked the\r\ngreat powers of the State. He made as his chief issues,\r\nIrrigation, Prison Reform, and a fairer share in the world's goods\r\nfor all the people. He traveled far and fast, often speaking six\r\ntimes in a day, at different places, and sometimes riding a\r\nhundred and fifty miles in twenty-four hours, over the rough roads\r\nof remote counties.\r\n\r\nWhile campaigning he outlined his notion of public service in this\r\nway, \"No man should have a political office because he wants a\r\njob. A public office is not a job, it is an opportunity to do\r\nsomething for the public. Once in office it remains for him to\r\nprove that the opportunity was not wasted. ...\" And again he\r\nsaid,--\"There is nothing that touches me so, in the little that I\r\nhave seen in political life, as this, that while it is a game in\r\nwhich men can be mean, contemptible and dastardly, it is a game\r\nalso that brings out the finer, better, and nobler qualities. I\r\nknow why some men are in politics to their own financial loss.\r\nBecause they find it is a great big man's game, which calls for\r\nmen to fight it, and they want to stand beside their fellows and\r\ndo battle.\"\r\n\r\nIn regretting that he could not attend a Democratic meeting, at\r\nRichmond, California, he sent this letter,--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LYMAN NAUGLE\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. NAUGLE,-- ... The cause of Democracy is being given\r\nmore sincere and thoughtful interest this campaign than for many\r\nyears. One of its cardinal principles is that the individual is\r\nmore important to the State than mere property, and that the\r\nwelfare of the majority of our citizens must always be paramount\r\nand their rights prevail, no matter what the weight of influence\r\nin the other side of the balance. It is work and personal worth\r\nwhich make a State great both politically and industrially, and in\r\nmy estimation they are to be found in largest proportions in the\r\nDemocratic party. For these reasons I believe there will be a very\r\nlarge change in the vote of this State in our coming election.\r\nReports have reached me from many parts of the State, and I am\r\nentirely satisfied that we shall win this fight provided that we\r\ndo our full share of earnest work, if that be lacking we don't\r\ndeserve it. ... Yours for honest victory,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nAt first Hearst's powerful paper, the San Francisco Examiner, took\r\na negative tone toward Lane's candidacy but soon became\r\ndangerously, if covertly, antagonistic. Of Hearst's methods of\r\nattack Lane wrote, in detail, on July 3, 1912, to Governor Woodrow\r\nWilson, then Democratic nominee for the Presidency. After\r\nenumerating one specific count after another against the Examiner\r\nLane said:--\r\n\r\n\"When a boy putting myself through college I was business manager\r\nof a temperance paper which advocated prohibition. He [Hearst]\r\npublished extracts from this paper and credited them to me, and on\r\nthe morning of election day sent a special train throughout the\r\nwhole of Northern California containing an issue of his paper,\r\nappealing to the saloon-keepers and wine-growers for my defeat.\r\n\r\n\"... No editorial word of his disfavor appeared, but in every news\r\narticle there was in the headline a cunning turn or twist,\r\ncalculated to arouse prejudice against me. I notice in this\r\nmorning's issue of the American the same policy is being pursued\r\nregarding you.\r\n\r\n\"Now the great mistake I made was in not boldly telling the public\r\njust what I knew. ... I felt that it was a personal matter with\r\nwhich the public was not concerned, but I know now, as I have\r\ngotten older and seen more of politics, that it was a public\r\nmatter of the first importance, as to which the public should have\r\nhad knowledge.\r\n\r\n\"Later when he [Hearst] budded as a candidate for President, in\r\n1904, he sought an interview with me and said that he was not to\r\nblame for the policy that had been pursued. Our interview closed\r\nwith this dialogue:--\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. Lane, if you ever wish anything that I can do, all you will\r\nhave to do will be to send me a telegram asking, and it will be\r\ndone.'\"\r\n\r\n\"To which I responded, 'Mr. Hearst, if you ever get a telegram\r\nfrom me asking you to do anything, you can put that telegram down\r\nas a forgery.'\"\r\n\r\nIn a State like California, one of whose chief industries was the\r\ngrowing of wine-grapes, and where the Examiner was the farmer's\r\npaper, at least one phase of the attack upon Lane bore heavy\r\nfruit. Upon election day the count between Lane and Dr. George\r\nPardee, the Republican candidate, was found to be close. In the\r\nend several thousand votes, unmistakably intended for Lane, were\r\nthrown out upon technicalities. Lane was defeated, and Dr. Pardee\r\ntook office. It was a bitter blow.\r\n\r\nThe night when the final bad news was brought to Lane in his home,\r\nhe called his son, of four, to him, leaning down he put his arm\r\naround the boy very gravely and tenderly, and said, \"Ned, it isn't\r\nmy little son, it is Dr. Pardee's little boy that is going to have\r\nthat white pony.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy caught the emotion in his father's voice, and said\r\ncheerily, \"O, that's all right, Dad. That's all right.\"\r\n\r\nLane found that in spite of the loss of the Governorship his\r\ncircle of personal contacts had been greatly widened by his\r\ncampaign. He had come to know, and be known by, the men most\r\nprominent in California public affairs and he had made, and\r\nconfirmed, many friendships with men who had given themselves\r\nwhole-heartedly to his advancement. Of these friendships he wrote,\r\nin 1920, to his friend Timothy Spellacy, \"Eighteen years I have\r\nknown you and never a word or act have I heard of, or seen, that\r\ndid not make me feel that the campaign for Governor was worth\r\nwhile because it gave me your acquaintance, friendship,\r\naffection. ... When I get mad, as I do sometimes, over something\r\nthat the Irish do, I always am tempted to a hard generalization\r\nthat I am compelled to modify because of you and Mike and Dan\r\nO'Neill, in San Francisco--and a few more of the Great Irish.\"\r\n\r\nLane's second child, Nancy, was born January 4, 1903.\r\n\r\nEarly in that year Lane was given the complimentary vote of his\r\nparty in the California Legislature for United States Senator.\r\n\r\nHe was chosen in April to go to Washington to argue the case of\r\nthe need of the City of San Francisco for a pure water supply from\r\nthe Hetch-Hetchy Valley, an unused part of the Yosemite Park.\r\n\r\nA curious opposition to this measure had been worked up in the\r\nEast by a small group of well-intentioned nature lovers who did\r\nnot, perhaps, realize that this was one of many thousand valleys\r\nin the Sierras, and one not, in any sense, unique in its beauty.\r\nThe plan proposed to convert a remote, mosquito-haunted marsh,\r\ndreaded even by hunters because of the \"bad-going\" into a large\r\nlake-reservoir to feed the city of San Francisco. This was the\r\nfirst of Lane's fights to assure to man the use of neglected\r\nresources, and at the same time, by great care, to protect natural\r\nbeauty for his delight.\r\n\r\nWhile in Washington on this errand, he met President Roosevelt\r\nseveral times. Their informal talks served to increase Lane's\r\nstrong liking for the vigorous man of action, then at the height\r\nof his powers.\r\n\r\nTo his friend he writes of all this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore San Francisco, May 9,1903\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WIGMORE,--My trip East was a great success. After leaving\r\nyou I stayed three or four days in Washington, where I found the\r\nDepartment of the Interior pretty well stacked against me; I,\r\nhowever, succeeded in having a day fixed upon which an argument\r\nwould be listened to, and after this victory went to New York,\r\nwhere I met many old friends and made some new ones. ...\r\n\r\nUpon my return to Washington I had several days of argument before\r\nthe Department, saw the President [Roosevelt] twice and lunched\r\nwith him, and then went South; was invited by the Legislature of\r\nTexas to speak before them, which I did with much satisfaction,\r\nespecially as there were but two Republicans in both houses.\r\n\r\nI stopped with my old friend Mezes, in Austin, who is the dean of\r\nthe University, ... and easily the most influential man socially,\r\npolitically, and educationally in the institution. ...\r\n\r\nI am having an extremely disagreeable time. The Democrats here\r\ninsist upon my running for Mayor, urging it as a duty which I owe\r\nto the party, because they say I am the only man who can be\r\nelected; and as a duty to the city, because they say that the\r\nscoundrels who are now in office will continue, and worse ones\r\ncome in, unless we can elect some clean Democrat. I urge\r\neverything against the thing, that comes to my mind, including my\r\npoverty, the fact that I made four campaigns in five years, my\r\npersonal aversion to the office of Mayor, the inability of any one\r\nto please the people of San Francisco as Mayor, the conspiracy of\r\nthe newspapers that exists against a government that is not\r\ncontrolled by them, and the fact that to insist upon my taking\r\nthis office would be an act of political murder on the part of my\r\nfriends. ... Yours as always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nHeavy and continued pressure, through the spring and summer, was\r\nbrought, by his party, to bear upon Lane to accept the nomination\r\nfor Mayor of San Francisco. His letters show his reluctance and\r\ndistress. The appeal was made personal, with reminders of\r\nsacrifices made for him. He at last agreed to run. His judgment of\r\nthe situation was fully confirmed in the final event. His defeat\r\nwas unequivocal. San Francisco had no idea of accepting a\r\nDemocratic mayor with a leaning toward reform. Lane analysed the\r\npolitical situation in this letter:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, January 26, 1904\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WIGMORE,--What the effect of my defeat for Mayor will be,\r\nit is of course impossible to say. Its immediate effect has been\r\nto throw me into the active practice of law, and thus far I have\r\nnot starved. It will, of course, not lead to my retirement from\r\npolitics, but it will postpone no doubt, the realization of some\r\nambitions. I think I wrote you just what my state of mind was\r\nprevious to the nomination. I did not wish to make the fight, did\r\neverything that was in my power to avoid the nomination, and even\r\nwent so far as to hold up the convention in a formal letter which\r\nI addressed to it, telling them that I did not wish to be Mayor of\r\nSan Francisco and begging them to get some one else.\r\n\r\nThe fight was along class lines entirely; the employers on one\r\nside and the wage earners on the other. The Republican nominee\r\nrepresented the employers, the Union Labor nominee, the wage\r\nearners. I stood for good government, and in the battle my voice\r\ncould hardly be heard. It was a splendid old fight in which every\r\ninterest that was vicious, violent, or corrupt was solidly against\r\nme. And while I did not win the election, I lost nothing in\r\nprestige by the defeat, save among politicians who are always\r\nlooking for availability. It was not, in the nature of things, up\r\nto me to run for Mayor, but my people all believed that I was\r\nassured of election and felt that I was the only man who could\r\npossibly be elected. I acted out of a sense of loyalty to my party\r\nand a desire to do something to rid the city of its present cursed\r\nadministration. However, it may in the end be a very fortunate\r\nthing, for I know no career more worthless than that of a\r\nperpetual office-seeker.\r\n\r\nI received a letter from a friend in New York yesterday telling me\r\nthat Senator Hill [Footnote: In campaigning New York for\r\nCleveland, Lane had met David B. Hill.] had told him that the New\r\nYork delegation would cast its vote for me for Vice-President at\r\nthe Democratic National Convention, and that he regarded me as the\r\nmost available man to nominate; but, of course, I sent back word\r\nthat that was not to be considered.\r\n\r\nI should judge from the EXAMINER here, that Hearst was making a\r\nvery strong fight for a delegation from Illinois. His boom seems\r\nto me to be increasing. That it is possible for such a man to\r\nreceive the nomination, is too humiliating to be thought of. ...\r\nVery sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nThe day after his defeat Lane had written to thank a generous\r\nfriend:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM R. WHEELER\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, Wednesday [November, 1908]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WILL,--I can't go to the country without saying to you\r\nonce more that your self-sacrifice and manliness throughout this\r\ncampaign have endeared you to me to a degree that words cannot\r\nconvey.\r\n\r\nI had hoped the last day or two that I would be able to make your\r\ncritics ashamed to look you in the face, and that they would in\r\ntime come pleading to you for recognition. But now you must be\r\ncontent with knowing that you did a man's part, and set a standard\r\nin friendship and loyalty which my boy shall be taught to strive\r\nfor.\r\n\r\nI earnestly hope that your business relations will not be\r\ndisturbed by this trouble into which I got you. Had I been out of\r\nit Crocker couldn't have won. My vote would largely have gone for\r\nSchmitz.\r\n\r\nGive my love to Mrs. Wheeler and believe me, always your friend,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nWheeler, himself a Republican, belonged, at the time, to a firm of\r\nirreconcilable Republicans, who had expressed sharp disapproval of\r\nhis activity in Lane's behalf.\r\n\r\nOut of office and back to the practise of the law, Lane soon built\r\nhis private practise on a firmer basis than before. His close\r\nidentification with the Democratic Party was not impaired, but the\r\nfrequent demands for attendance at public conventions and meetings\r\nhe could not leave his practise to accept. In declining one of\r\nthese invitations he replied:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ORVA G. WILLIAMS IROQUOIS CLUB, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, April 7, 1904\r\n\r\n... Permit me to say that we of the West look to you who are\r\ncloser to the center of things for leadership. ... This means only\r\nthat we must be true to the principles that make us Democrats. ...\r\nThe law must not be severe or lenient with any man simply because\r\nhe is rich nor because he is poor. It must not become the tool of\r\nclass antagonism for either the persecution of the well-to-do or\r\nfor the repression of the masses of the people.\r\n\r\n... We must resist the base opportunism which would abandon our\r\nstrong position of devotion to these fundamental principles of\r\ngood government for the sake of gaining temporary strength from\r\nsome passing passion of the hour. To identify our party with an\r\nidea which springs from class distrust or class hatred is to gain\r\ntemporary stimulation at the expense of permanent weakness. If we\r\nare to heed the voice which bids us cease to be Democrats in order\r\nthat we may win, we shall find that we have lost not only the\r\nvictory of being true, but also the victory at the polls, which\r\ncan be ours only in case we are true.\r\n\r\n... Our creed is simple and clear, but it cannot be recited by\r\nthose who would make our organization an annex to the Republican\r\nparty by catering to that conservatism which seeks only to bring\r\ngreater benefit to the already wealthy, nor by those who would\r\nmake it an annex to the Socialist party by joining in every\r\nattack, no matter how unjust, upon the wealthy. Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Iroquois Club of Los Angeles on the same day he wrote,--\"It\r\nbecomes us to consider well the meaning of the signs of the times.\r\nMiracles may not be worked with these waves of prosperity. It is\r\nin no man's power to say 'Peace, be still' and quiet the troubled\r\nsea of panic. But we may make sure that men of steady nerve, of\r\nclear head and highest purpose are at the helm. I expect to see\r\nthe time when the Democratic party will, by fixed adherence to a\r\nwell-defined course, gain and hold the approval and support of the\r\nmajority of our people, not for a single election but for a long\r\nseries of elections, and if we begin now with this end in view we\r\ncertainly will be prepared for whatever may happen--victory or\r\ndefeat; and in both alike we will be proud of our party and give a\r\nguarantee for the future.\"\r\n\r\nWhile campaigning California for Governor, in 1902, Isadore B.\r\nDockweiler ran on Lane's ticket, for the office of Lieutenant\r\nGovernor, and Dockweiler still looked to him for counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ISADORE B. DOCKWEILER\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, April 16, 1904\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DOCKWEILER,--You ask in your favor of the 14th whether\r\nCalifornia will send a delegation to St. Louis pledged to Mr.\r\nHearst and if this program has been agreed upon, as is the report\r\nin Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell what the Democrats of California will do, but I know\r\nwhat they should do. A delegation should go from this state that\r\nis free, unowned, unpledged, made up of men whose prime interest\r\nis that of their party and whom the party does not need to bind\r\nwith pledges. To pledge the delegation is to make the delegates\r\nmere pawns, puppets, counters, coins to trade with,--so much\r\npolitical wampum.\r\n\r\nThe object in holding a national convention is not to please the\r\nvanity nor gratify the ambition of any individual, but to select a\r\nnational standard bearer who will proudly lead the party in the\r\ncampaign and be a credit to the party and an honor to the nation,\r\nif elected. Surely the Democracy of California can select\r\ncandidates who can be depended upon to be guided by these\r\nconsiderations. To tie the delegates hand and foot, toss them into\r\na bag, and sling them over the shoulder of one man to barter as he\r\nmay please, is not consistent with my notion of the dignity of\r\ntheir position, nor does it appeal to me as the most certain\r\nmanner of making them effective in enlarging and emphasizing the\r\npower of the state. ...\r\n\r\nAs to your suggestion of a program to deliver this state to one\r\ncandidate--if there is such a program--I am not a party to it,\r\nnever have been, and never will be. ... The Democrats of\r\nCalifornia ... will do much for the sake of harmony so long as\r\nparty welfare and public good are not sacrificed; but they must be\r\npermitted to make their own program irrespective of the personal\r\nalliances, affiliations, or ambitions of politicians.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I am not in active political life. My views upon party\r\nquestions I do not attempt to impose upon my party, yet I know of\r\nno reason why I should hesitate to give them expression. I cannot\r\nbut believe that if many a man were more indifferent to his\r\nfuture, he would be more certain to have a future.\r\n\r\nThere is one reason which to my mind should forbid my active\r\ndirection of any organized movement against Mr. Hearst, namely the\r\nattitude of his paper during my recent campaign for the\r\ngovernorship. I do not wish it to be said or thought that I am\r\nseeking to use our party for purposes of personal retaliation.\r\nWhatever reasons for bitterness I may have because of that\r\ncampaign I am persuaded it does not affect my judgment that it is\r\nthe part of wisdom to send an unpledged delegation to the national\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats of California should determine with calmness and\r\nwithout passion what course will be most likely to prove a matter\r\nof pride to themselves, their state, and the nation, and in that\r\nsober judgment act fearlessly.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Coast, in 1904, still suffered from transportation\r\nproblems of great complexity. The railroads, whose terminals were\r\nhere, were few and extraordinarily powerful and had, heretofore,\r\ncontrolled rail traffic, to a large extent, in their own interest.\r\nThey wanted no regulation or interference from the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission and no Pacific Coast representative on that\r\nCommission. The fruit, wheat, and lumber producers of the Western\r\nCoast, on the other hand, felt the need of a strong representative\r\nto protect their interests against the railroads, and to stabilize\r\nfreight rates. Lane's record for independence of sinister control,\r\nhis legal training and energy made him the natural choice of the\r\nshippers for this position.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Ide Wheeler, President of the University of California,\r\nwas a friend of Lane's and also a friend of President Roosevelt's.\r\nWhile in the East, in the spring of 1904, Wheeler had a talk with\r\nRoosevelt, about Lane's qualifications for the Interstate Commerce\r\nappointment. He told Roosevelt why the producers in California\r\nneeded a man that they could trust to be fair to their interests\r\non the Commission. Roosevelt heartily concurred, and promised to\r\nname Lane for the next vacancy.\r\n\r\nWhen the vacancy occurred, however, just after an overwhelming\r\nRepublican victory, Roosevelt impulsively gave the appointment to\r\nan old friend--Senator Cockrill of Missouri, a Democrat. Wheeler\r\nat once telegraphed the President reminding him of the oversight,\r\nand to this Roosevelt telegraphed this reply:--\r\n\r\n\"Am exceedingly sorry, had totally forgotten my promise about Lane\r\nand have nothing to say excepting that I had totally forgotten it\r\nwhen Senator Cockrill was offered the position. I can only say now\r\nthat I shall put him in some good position suitable to his great\r\ntalents and experience when the chance occurs. Of course when I\r\nmade the promise about Lane the idea of getting Cockrill for the\r\nposition could not be in any one's head. This does not excuse me\r\nfor breaking the promise, which I should never have done, and of\r\ncourse, if I had remembered it I should not have offered the\r\nposition to Cockrill. I am very sorry. But as fortunately I have\r\nanother term, I shall make ample amends to Lane later.\"\r\n\r\nIn September, 1905, while matters were in this position, Lane went\r\nto Mexico, as legal adviser for a western rubber company. In\r\nOctober, Roosevelt announced his intention to place Lane on the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, to fill the annual vacancy that\r\noccurred in December. The announcement caused much newspaper\r\ncomment, especially in the more partisan Republican press, as the\r\ncoming vacancy would leave two Republicans and two Democrats on\r\nthe Commission.\r\n\r\nWhen Lane reached the United States he wrote:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD B. WHITNEY\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, November 13,1905\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WHITNEY,--I have just returned from a two months' trip\r\nthrough Mexico, from the Rio Grande to Guatemala, and from the\r\nGulf to the Pacific, and know nothing whatever concerning the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commissionership, save what I have seen in the\r\npapers since my return. ... I have not put myself in the position\r\nof soliciting, either directly or indirectly, this appointment; I\r\nhave never even stimulated to a slight degree the activity ... of\r\nmy friends on my behalf. There is some misgiving in my own mind as\r\nto whether acceptance of the position would be of benefit to me\r\neither politically, or otherwise. I have no doubt the nomination\r\nfor Governor can be mine next year without effort, and what the\r\noutcome of an election would be in 1906, even in a Republican\r\nState, is not now to be prophesied, in view of the somersaults in\r\nOhio and Pennsylvania of a week ago. Of course, ... it is a great\r\nopportunity to prove or disprove the capacity of this government\r\nto control effectively the corporations which seem determined to\r\nbe its master.\r\n\r\nIt does look to me as if the problem of our generation is to be\r\nthe discovery of some effective method by which the artificial\r\npersons whom we have created by law can be taught that they are\r\nnot the creators, the owners, and the rightful managers of the\r\ngovernment. The real greatness of the President's policy, to my\r\nnotion, is that he has determined to prove to the railroads that\r\nthey have not the whole works, and the policy that they have\r\nfollowed is as short-sighted as it can be. It will lead, if\r\npursued as it has been begun, to the wildest kind of a craze for\r\ngovernment ownership of everything. Just as you people in New York\r\nCity were forced, by the delinquency and corruption of the gas\r\ncombine, to undertake the organization of a municipal ownership\r\nmovement, so it may be that the same qualities in the railroads\r\nwill create precisely the same spirit throughout the country.\r\n\r\nI appreciate thoroughly your position in New York. ... [Hearst]\r\nknows public sentiment and how to develop it very well, and will\r\nbe a danger in the United States, I am afraid, for many years to\r\ncome. He has great capacity for disorganization of any movement\r\nthat is not his own, and an equal capacity for organization of any\r\nmovement that is his personal property. He feels with the people,\r\nbut he has no conscience. ... He is willing to do whatever for the\r\nminute the people may want done and give them what they cry for,\r\nunrestrained by sense of justice, or of ultimate effect. He is the\r\ngreat American Pander.\r\n\r\nReverting again to the Interstate Commerce Commissionership, I\r\nthink the railroads here are determined that no Pacific Coast man\r\nshall be appointed. That has been the policy of the Southern\r\nPacific since the creation of the Commission. ...\r\n\r\nOne of the amusing reports that has come to me is that the\r\nrailroad feels friendly toward me. I think probably the extent of\r\ntheir friendliness is in acknowledging that I am not a\r\nblackmailer. They know that I would not hold them up, just as well\r\nas they know that I could not be held up. In the various campaigns\r\nthat I have made, it has never been suggested that the railroads\r\nhad any more influence with me than they ought to have, or that\r\nanybody else had, and in my fight for the Governorship they did\r\nnot contribute so much as a single postcard, nor did an individual\r\nrailroad man contribute a dollar to the campaign fund. I\r\nsay this because I heard yesterday that word had gone to the\r\nPresident that I was something of a railroad man, which is about\r\nthe most amusing thing that I have heard for sometime. The charge\r\nnever was made in any of my five campaigns, and certainly is made\r\nonly for foreign consumption, end not for home consumption.\r\n\r\nDo not in any way put yourself out regarding this matter. I am\r\nsatisfied that the President will do just what he wants to do and\r\njust what he thinks right, without much respect to what anybody\r\nsays to him, and I don't want to bring pressure to bear upon him;\r\nbut, of course, I want him to know that I have friends who think\r\nwell of me. I am very appreciative of your offer and efforts, and\r\nhope that, whether I am given this position or not, I shall before\r\nvery long have the opportunity of seeing you in New York. Very\r\nsincerely,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HON. THEODORE ROOSEVELT THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, December 9, [1905]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--I have not written you before because of\r\nmy expectation that I would see you soon, but as there now seems\r\nsome doubt as to immediate confirmation I will not longer delay\r\nexpressing the deep gratification which the nomination gave me.\r\nYou gave the one answer I could have wished to the whispered\r\ncharge that I was bound by obligation of some sort to the\r\nrailroads--a charge never made in any form here, not even in the\r\nhottest of my five campaigns. My honor stood pledged to you--by\r\nthe very fact of my willingness to accept the post--that I was\r\nfree, independent, self-owned, capable of unbiased action. And\r\nthat pledge remains.\r\n\r\nAs to my confirmation, it has been suggested that it was the\r\ncustomary and expected thing for me to go to Washington and help\r\nin the fight. This I feel I should not do and have so written to\r\nSenator Perkins and others. I do not wish to appear indifferent in\r\nthe slightest degree to the honor you have done me, or to the\r\noffice itself, but I feel that you will appreciate without my\r\nsetting them forth on paper the many reasons which hold me here.\r\nThis is no time for an Interstate Commerce Commissioner to be on\r\nhis knees before a United States Senator or to be thought to be in\r\nthat position. Very respectfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Benjamin Ide Wheeler President, University of California\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, December 15, 1905\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. WHEELER,--I enclose copy of a letter sent this morning\r\nto Mr. Smythe of San Diego, who is temporarily with Senator\r\nNewlands in Washington.\r\n\r\nI wanted to tell you last night that I had written to the\r\nPresident thanking him for the confidence he had shown in me, and\r\ntelling him that I did not think it was the right thing for me to\r\ngo to Washington under present circumstances. He may have a\r\ndifferent notion in this respect, and of course I should be guided\r\nby his judgment ... I have no doubt that many of the Senators\r\nwould be quite willing to let the President have the law if they\r\ncould have the Commission ...\r\n\r\nPersonally I should be most pleased to meet these critical\r\ngentlemen of the Senate and give them a very full account of my\r\neventful career. But the fact that I am a Democrat could not be\r\ndisproved by my presence in Washington, and I am not likely to\r\napologize for what one of my kindly Republican critics calls \"this\r\nerror of his boyhood.\" I am concerned in this matter because I do\r\nnot wish to cause the President any embarrassment. He is fighting\r\nfor far larger things than this appointment represents. He knows\r\nhis own game, and I am quite willing to stand on a side line and\r\nsee him play it to a finish, or get in and buck the center if I am\r\nneeded. I must apologize for troubling you with this matter, but I\r\ndo not wish you to regard me as indifferent or unappreciative. And\r\nif you think that I am too far up in the clouds I want you frankly\r\nto tell me so. Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo William E. Smythe\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, December 15,1905\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. SMYTHE,--I have been out of town for a few days, else\r\nI would have acknowledged your kind letter of congratulation\r\nsooner. I sent a note the other day to our friend Senator Newlands\r\nin recognition of the effort he has been making to secure action\r\nupon my appointment, and I certainly regard myself as very\r\nfortunate in having one who knows me upon that Committee.\r\n[Footnote: The Interstate Commerce Committee.]\r\n\r\nAccording to the press despatches here I am regarded as something\r\nof a monster by the more conservative Senators, a sort of cross\r\nbetween Dennis Kearney and Eugene Debs with a little of Herr Most\r\nthrown in ... I wish for confirmation, but not at the price of\r\nhaving it thought that I in any way compromised myself to obtain\r\nthe Senate's favorable action. I know that you are not alone in\r\nthis view as to the wisdom of my going on, for I have received\r\nother messages to the same effect. But, as you know, the President\r\nmade this appointment upon grounds quite superior to those of\r\npolitical expediency and upon recommendations not at all political\r\nin their nature ... Very truly yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, December 21, [1905]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WIGMORE,--Your letter bore good fruit ... As for\r\nconfirmation it is not as likely as I could wish. However, I am\r\nenjoying the situation hugely, and if the fight is kept up I may\r\nenlarge into a national issue.\r\n\r\nThe Press of California (notice the respectful capital) is\r\npractically a unit for me ... My information is that the President\r\nwill stand pat. But the fight with the Senate is growing so large\r\nthat no one can tell what will happen. I have been urged to go to\r\nWashington and meet the Senators, but I have refused. ... Am I not\r\nright?\r\n\r\nRemember me very kindly to your wife, and to you both a Merry\r\nChristmas. As always yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Benjamin Ide Wheeler President, University of California\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, December 22, [1905]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. WHEELER,--It was mighty good of you to bring me that\r\nmessage of good cheer last night. I have not told you, and cannot\r\nnow tell you the very great pleasure and gratification you have\r\ngiven me by the many evidences of your personal friendship. To me\r\nit is better to have that kind of friendship than any office.\r\n\r\nI have just received a letter from the President [Roosevelt] that\r\nis so fine I want you to know of it at once--but the original I\r\nkeep for home use. Here it is:--\r\n\r\n\"... I thank you for your frank and manly letter. It is just the\r\nkind of a letter I should have expected from you. You are\r\nabsolutely right in refraining from coming here. I shall make and\r\nam making as stiff a fight as I know how for you. I think I shall\r\ncarry you through; but of course nothing of this kind is ever\r\ncertain. ...\"\r\n\r\nPlease remember me most kindly to Mrs. Wheeler and believe me\r\nalways, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe California earthquake, of April 18, 1906, occurred at about\r\nfive o'clock in the morning. Lane was living in North Berkeley,\r\nacross the bay from San Francisco. His house built of light wood\r\nand shingles, rocked, and his chimneys flung down bricks, in the\r\nsuccessive shocks, but with no serious damage. Meanwhile San\r\nFrancisco sprang into flames from hundreds of broken gas mains.\r\nLane reached the city early in the morning, and was at once put,\r\nby the Mayor, upon the Committee of Fifty to look to the safety of\r\nthe City.\r\n\r\nWill Irwin wrote this picturesque story of the episode after\r\nhaving heard his friend describe this adventure:--\r\n\r\n\"Lane has said since that, although he was brought up in the old\r\nWest, his was a city life after all. He had never tested himself\r\nagainst primitive physical force, tried himself out in an\r\nemergency, and he had always longed for such a test before he\r\ndied. When the test came it was a supreme one: the San Francisco\r\ndisaster. ...\r\n\r\n\"On the last day but one of this visitation the fire, smoldering\r\nslowly in the redwood houses, had taken virtually all the district\r\neast of Van Ness Avenue, a broad street which bisects the\r\nresidence quarter. ... By this time the authorities had given up\r\ndynamiting. Chief Sullivan, the one man among them who understood\r\nthe use of explosives in fire fighting, was dead. The work had\r\nbeen done by soldiers from the Presidio, who blew up buildings too\r\nclose to the flames and so only scattered them. Lane stood on the\r\nslope of Russian Hill, watching the fire approach Van Ness Avenue,\r\nwhen a contractor named Anderson came along. 'That fire always\r\ncatches at the eaves, not the foundations,' said Lane. 'It could\r\nbe stopped right here if some one would dynamite all the block\r\nbeyond Van Ness Avenue. It could never jump across a strip so\r\nbroad.' 'But they've forbidden any more dynamiting,' said\r\nAnderson. 'Never mind; I'd take the chance myself if we could get\r\nany explosive,' replied Lane. 'Well, there's a launch full of\r\ndynamite from Contra Costa County lying right now at Meigs's\r\nWharf,' said Anderson. Just then Mr. and Mrs. Tom Magee arrived,\r\ndriving an automobile on the wheel rims. Lane despatched them to\r\nMeigs's Wharf for the dynamite. He and Anderson found an electric\r\nbattery, and cut some dangling wires from a telephone pole. By\r\nthis time the Magees were back, the machine loaded with dynamite;\r\nMrs. Magee carrying a box of detonators on her lap. Lane,\r\nAnderson, and a corps of volunteers laid the battery and strung\r\nthe wires. 'How do you want this house to fall?' asked Anderson,\r\nwho understands explosives. 'Send her straight up,' replied Lane.\r\n\r\n\"'And I've never forgotten the picture which followed,' Lane has\r\ntold me since. 'Anderson disappeared inside, came out, and said:\r\n\"All ready.\" I joined the two ends of wire which I held in my\r\nhands. The house rose twenty feet in the air--intact, mind you! It\r\nlooked like a scene in a fairy book. At that point I rolled over\r\non my back, and when I got up the house was nothing but dust and\r\nsplinters.'\r\n\r\n\"They went down the line, blowing up houses, schools, churches.\r\nThen came bad news. To the south sparks were catching on the eaves\r\nof the houses. Down there was a little water in cisterns.\r\nVolunteers under Lane's direction made the householders stretch\r\nwet blankets over the roofs and eaves. Then again bad news from\r\nthe north. There the fire had really crossed the avenue. It\r\nthreatened the Western Addition, the best residence district. The\r\ncause seemed lost. Lane ran up and looked over the situation. Only\r\na few houses were afire, and the slow-burning redwood was\r\nsmoldering but feebly. 'Just a little water would stop this!' he\r\nthought. The whole water system of San Francisco was gone, or\r\nsupposedly so, through the breaking of the mains. 'But I had a\r\nhunch, just a hunch,' said Lane, 'that there was water somewhere\r\nin the pipes.' He had learned that a fire company which had given\r\nup the fight was asleep on a haystack somewhere in the Western\r\nAddition. He went out and found them. They had been working for\r\nthirty-six hours; they lay like dead men. Lane kicked the soles of\r\nthe nearest fireman. He returned only a grunt. The next fireman,\r\nhowever, woke up; Lane managed to get him enthusiastic. He found a\r\nwrench, and together he and Lane went from hydrant to hydrant,\r\nturning on the cocks. The first five or six gave only a faint\r\nspurt and ceased to flow. Then, and just when the fireman was\r\ngetting ready to go on strike, they turned a cock no more\r\npromising than the others, and out spurted a full head of water.\r\nNo one knows to this day where that water came from, but it was\r\nthere! They shut off the stream. 'It will take three engines to\r\npump it to that blaze,' said the fireman. He, Lane, and Anderson\r\nscattered in opposite directions looking for engines. When twenty\r\nminutes later, Lane returned with an engine and company two others\r\nhad already arrived. But they had not yet coupled the hose up. The\r\ncompanies were quarreling as to which, under the rules of the\r\ndepartment, should have the position of honor close to the\r\nhydrant! Lane settled that question of etiquette with speed and\r\nforce. They got a stream on the incipient fire, and the water held\r\nout. The other side of Van Ness Avenue gradually burned out and\r\nsettled down into red coals. The Western Addition was saved, and\r\nthe San Francisco disaster was over.\"\r\n\r\nA few days later Lane started to Washington in an attempt to raise\r\nmoney for the rebuilding of San Francisco. When he found that\r\nCongress would not act in this matter, he, with Senator Newlands,\r\nof Nevada, and some others, went to the President and the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury to see if Federal help could be secured\r\nfor the ruined city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo William R. Wheeler\r\n\r\nNew York, June 23, [1906]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WILL,--I have just returned from Washington, where I hope\r\nwe have accomplished some good for San Francisco, although it was\r\nmighty hard to move anyone except the President and the Secretary\r\nof the Treasury. But I did not intend to write of anything but\r\nyour personal affairs. Yesterday, on the train, I discovered that\r\nyou had met with another fire. This is rubbing it in, hitting a\r\nman when he is down. The Gods don't fight fair. The decent rules\r\nof the Marquis of Queensberry seem to have no recognition on\r\nOlympus, or wherever the Gods live. I can quite appreciate the\r\nstrain you are under and the monumental difficulties of your\r\nsituation, dealing as you are with dispirited old men and\r\nindifferent young ones, I hope this last blow will have some\r\nbenefit which I cannot now perceive, else it must come like almost\r\na knock-out to the concern. Brave, strong, bully old boy, no one\r\nknows better than I do what a fight you have been making these\r\nlast few years and how many unkindnesses fortune has done you.\r\nThere is not much use either in preaching to one's self or to\r\nanother, the advantages of adversity. I don't believe that men are\r\nmade by fighting relentless Fate, the stuff they have is sometimes\r\nproved by struggle,--that is the best that can be said for such\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\nMore power to you my dear fellow! I took occasion to give M ... a\r\nwarm dose of Bill Wheeler. He is an old sour-ball who thinks he is\r\nalive but evidently has been in the cemetery a long time. He\r\ntalked all right about you, but all wrong about San Francisco ...\r\n\r\nGive my regards to the dear wife whose heart is stout enough to\r\nmeet any calamity, and remember me most warmly to the Boy.\r\nSincerely and affectionately yours, FRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hepburn Bill provided for seven men on the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, instead of five. Roosevelt intimated that he would\r\nappoint two Republicans. All opposition to Lane was then\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nNew York, June 27, [1906]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WIGMORE,--Thanks, and again thanks, for your letter to\r\nSenator Cullom and yours to me. It looks now as if with a seven\r\nman Commission the objection to my Democracy would cease. Senator\r\nCullom's letter is very reassuring, and I wish that I had met him\r\nwhen in Washington. ...\r\n\r\nBefore another week this business of mine will have come to a\r\nhead, and I hope soon after to start West, via Chicago.\r\n\r\nIf the report to-day is true that Harlan of Chicago is to go on\r\nthe Commission, you will have two friends on the body. I\r\npersonally think most highly of Harlan and would be mighty proud\r\nto sit beside him. His political fortune seems to have been akin\r\nto mine, and we have one dear and cherished enemy in common.\r\n\r\nRemember me most kindly to your wife and believe me, faithfully\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTelegram. To John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nNew York, June 30, [1906]\r\n\r\nConfirmation has to-day arrived thanks to a friend or two like\r\nWigmore.\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo William R. Wheeler\r\n\r\nWashington, July 2, [1906]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BILL,--I have waited until this minute to write you, that\r\nI might send you the first greeting from the new office. I have\r\njust been sworn in and signed the oath, and to you I turn first to\r\nexpress gratitude, appreciation, and affection.\r\n\r\nMy hope is to leave here tomorrow and go to Chicago at once on\r\nyour affair, and then West.\r\n\r\nRemember me most affectionately to your wife, and believe me\r\nalways most faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the same time an affectionate letter of appreciation went to\r\nBenjamin Ide Wheeler.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nRAILROAD AND NATIONAL POLICIES\r\n\r\n1906-1912\r\n\r\nIncreased powers of Interstate Commerce Commission--Harriman\r\nInquiry--Railroad Regulation--Letters to Roosevelt\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the late summer of 1906, Lane was in Washington or\r\ntraveling through the South and West to attend the hearings of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission. The Hepburn Act of 1906, among\r\nother extensions of power to the Commission, brought the express\r\ncompanies of the United States under its jurisdiction, and the\r\nCommission began the close investigation into the rates, rules,\r\nand practises, that finally resulted in a complete reorganization\r\nand zoning of the companies. The new powers given the Commission,\r\nby this Act, inspired fresh hope of righting old abuses,\r\nassociated with railroad finance, over-capitalization and stock-\r\njobbing. The Commission set itself to finding a way out of the\r\nancient quarrel between shippers and railroads in the matters of\r\nrebating and demurrage charges.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the year, President Roosevelt called an\r\nimportant meeting at the White House, for the purpose of deciding\r\nwhether an inquiry should not be made into the merging of the\r\nWestern railroads, then under the control of E. H. Harriman. Elihu\r\nRoot, then Secretary of State; William H. Taft, Secretary of War;\r\nCharles Bonaparte, Attorney General, were present; Chairman Martin\r\nA. Knapp and Franklin K. Lane of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, and the special Counsel for the Commission--Frank B.\r\nKellogg. The matter of the proposed inquiry was discussed, each\r\nman being asked, in turn, to express his opinion. Root and Knapp\r\nwere not in favor of beginning an investigation of the railroad\r\nmerger, Bonaparte, Kellogg, and Lane favored an immediate inquiry.\r\nLane declared that, in a few weeks, when the report of the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission was published, it would be\r\nimpossible to avoid making the inquiry.\r\n\r\nAt this point, President Roosevelt turned to William H. Taft, who\r\nas yet had expressed no opinion, saying, \"Will, what do you think\r\nof this?\" Mr. Taft said quietly, \"It's right, isn't it? Well, damn\r\nit, do it then.\" And the plans for the famous Harriman Inquiry,\r\nthe first real step taken toward curbing the power of public\r\nutilities, were then taken under consideration.\r\n\r\nDuring the inquiry, when E. H. Harriman was on the stand for\r\nhours, the Commissioners trying to extract, by round-about\r\nquestioning, the admission from him that he would like to extend\r\nhis control over the railroads of the country, Lane, who had been\r\nsilent for some time, suddenly turned and asked Harriman the\r\ndirect question. What would he do with all the roads in the\r\ncountry, if he had the power? With equal candor and simplicity,\r\nHarriman replied that he would consolidate them under his own\r\nmanagement. This answer rang through the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD F. ADAMS\r\n\r\nWashington, February 16, 1907\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ADAMS,-- ... I think the standpoint taken by our railroad\r\nfriends in 1882 is that which possesses their souls to-day. I am\r\nconscious each time I ask a question that there is deep resentment\r\nin the heart of the railroad official at being compelled to\r\nanswer, but that he is compelled to, he recognizes. The operating\r\nand traffic officials of the railroads are having a very hard time\r\nthese days with the law departments. They can not understand why\r\nthe law department advises them to give the information we demand,\r\nand I have heard of some most lively conferences in which the\r\ncounsel of the companies were blackguarded heartily for being\r\ncowards, in not fighting the Commission. You certainly took\r\nadvanced ground in 1882, ... --there can be no such thing as a\r\nbusiness secret in a quasi-public corporation. ... Very truly\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER PRESIDENT, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nWashington, March 31,1907\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. WHEELER,-- ... I have taken the liberty of giving Mr.\r\nAladyin, leader of the Group of Toil in the Russian Duma, a note\r\nof introduction. He's an immensely interesting young man, a fine\r\nspeaker and comes from plain, peasant stock. He will talk to your\r\nboys if you ask him. During these days of panic in Wall Street the\r\nPresident [Roosevelt] has called me in often and shown in many\r\nways that he in no way regrets the appointment you urged. I have\r\nbeen much interested in studying him in time of stress. He is one\r\nof the most resolute of men and at the same time entirely and\r\naltogether reasonable. No man I know is more willing to take\r\nsuggestion. No one leads him, not even Root, but no one need fear\r\nto give suggestion. He lives up to his legend, so far as I can\r\ndiscover, and that's a big order. The railroad men who are wise\r\nwill rush to the support of the policies he will urge before the\r\nnext Congress, or they will have national ownership to face as an\r\nimmediate issue, or a character of regulation that they will\r\nregard as intolerable.\r\n\r\nYou will be here again soon and I hope that you will come directly\r\nto our house and give us the pleasure of a genuine visit. ...\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ELIHU ROOT\r\n\r\nWashington, February 14, 1908\r\n\r\nMy DEAR MR. SECRETARY,--I have lately been engaged in writing an\r\nopinion upon the jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission over ocean carriers engaged in foreign commerce, and it\r\nhas occurred to me that an extensive American merchant marine\r\nmight be developed by some legislation which would permit American\r\nships to enjoy preferential through routes in conjunction with our\r\nrailroad systems. The present Interstate Commerce Law, as I\r\ninterpret it, gives to the Commission jurisdiction over carriers\r\nto the seaboard. It is the assumption of the law that rates will\r\nbe made to and from the American ports and that at such ports all\r\nships may equally compete for foreign cargo.\r\n\r\nMight it not be possible to extend the jurisdiction of the\r\nCommission over all American vessels engaged in foreign trade, and\r\nwith such ships alone--they alone being fully amenable to our law\r\n--permit the railroad which carries to the port to make through\r\njoint rates to the foreign point of destination? There is so vast\r\na volume of this through traffic that the preference which could\r\nthus be given to the American ship would act as a most substantial\r\nsubsidy. There may be objections to this suggestion arising either\r\nout of national or international policy which render it unworthy\r\nof further consideration. It has appealed to me, however, as\r\npossibly containing the germ of what Mr. Webster would have termed\r\na \"respectable idea.\" Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. B. BEARD\r\n\r\nWashington, December 19, 1908\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. BEARD,--I have not seen the article in the CALL, to\r\nwhich you refer, but have heard of it from a couple of\r\nCalifornians, much to my distress. Of course I appreciate that at\r\na time of strain such as that which you shippers and business men\r\nof California are now undergoing, it is to be expected that the\r\nmost conservative language will not be used. ... The trouble is\r\nwith the law. ... It is only upon complaint that an order can be\r\nmade reducing a rate, and I understand that such complaints are at\r\npresent being drafted in San Francisco and will in time come\r\nbefore us but such matters cannot be brought to issue in a week\r\nnor heard in a day, and when I tell you that we have on hand four\r\nhundred cases, at the present time, you will appreciate how great\r\nthe volume of our work is, and that you are not alone in your\r\nfeeling of indignation or of distress. If you will examine the\r\ndocket of the Commission, you will find that the cases of the\r\nPacific Coast have been taken care of more promptly within the\r\nlast two years than the cases in any other part of the United\r\nStates. I have seen to this myself, because of the long neglect of\r\nthat part of the country. ...\r\n\r\nI want to speak one direct personal word to you. You are now\r\nprotesting against increased rates. I have outlined to you the\r\nonly remedy [a change in the law] that I see available against the\r\ncontinuance of just such a policy on the part of the railroads,\r\nand I think it might be well for you to see that the Senators and\r\nRepresentatives from California support this legislation. It is\r\nnot calculated in any way to do injustice or injury to the\r\nrailroads. ... This is a plan which I have proposed myself, and\r\nfor which I have secured the endorsement of the Commission. The\r\nSan Francisco Chamber of Commerce has endorsed it. The whole\r\nPacific Coast should follow suit enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nPlease remember that I am not the Commissioner from California;\r\nthat I am a Commissioner for the United States; and that it is not\r\nmy business to fight the railroads, but to hear impartially what\r\nboth sides may have to say and be as entirely fair with the\r\nrailroads as with the shippers. I am flattered to know that the\r\nrailroad men of the United States do not regard me as a deadhead\r\non this Commission. My aggressiveness on behalf of the shipping\r\npublic has brought upon my head much criticism, and it would be\r\nthe greatest satisfaction for those who have been prosecuted for\r\nrebating or discovered in illegal practises to feel that they were\r\nable in any degree to raise in the minds of the shippers any\r\nquestion of my loyalty to duty.\r\n\r\nI expect to be in California during January, for a few days, and\r\nhope that I may see you at that time. Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, February 13, 1909\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--... I suppose you haven't seen my interview on\r\nthe Japanese question. I gave it at the request of the President\r\n[Roosevelt], because he said that the Republican Senators and\r\nCongressmen would not stand by him if it was going to be a\r\npartisan question in California politics. So I said that I would\r\ngive the value of my name and influence to the support of his\r\npolicy, so that Flint, Kahn, ET AL., could quote me as against any\r\nattack by the Democrats. The President has done great work for the\r\nCoast. Congress never would have done anything at this time, and\r\nby the time it is willing to do something the problem will\r\npractically be solved. I am expecting to be roasted somewhat, in\r\nCalifornia, but I felt that it was only right to stand by the man\r\nwho was really making our fight without any real backing from the\r\nEast, and without many friends on the Pacific--so far as the\r\n\"pollies\" are concerned.\r\n\r\n... The Harriman crowd seems to think that they will all be on\r\ngood terms with Taft, but unless I'm mistaken in the man they will\r\nbe greatly fooled. ...\r\n\r\nHave you noticed that nice point of constitutional law, dug up by\r\na newspaper reporter, which renders Knox ineligible as Secretary\r\nof State? He voted for an increase in the salary of the Secretary\r\nof State three years ago. They will try to avoid the effect of the\r\nconstitutional inhibition by repealing the act increasing the\r\nsalary. Technically this won't do Knox any good, altho' it will\r\nprobably be upheld by the Courts, if the matter is ever taken into\r\nthe Courts.\r\n\r\nRoosevelt is very nervous these days but as he said to me the\r\nother day, \"They know that I am President right up to March\r\nfourth.\" I took Ned and Nancy to see him and he treated them most\r\nbeautifully. Gave Ned a pair of boar tusks from the Philippines\r\nand told him a story about the boar ripping up a man's leg just\r\nbefore he was shot, and to them both he gave a personal card.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nWith this letter he sent a copy of a verse written by his\r\ndaughter, not yet seven.\r\n\r\n    \"On through the night as the willows go weeping\r\n    The daffodils sigh,\r\n    As the wind sweeps by\r\n    Right through the sky.\"\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES K. MCCLATCHY SACRAMENTO BEE\r\n\r\nWashington, March 20, 1909\r\n\r\nMy Dear McClatchy,--I am just in receipt of your letter of March\r\n15th, with reference to my running for Governor next year.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in this rumor whatever. I have been approached by\r\na good many people on this matter, and perhaps I have not said as\r\ndefinitely as I should that I had no expectation of re-entering\r\nCalifornia politics. When I was last in California some of my\r\nfriends pointed out to me the great opening there would be for me\r\nif I would become a Republican and lead the Lincoln-Roosevelt\r\npeople. There does not seem to be any line of demarcation between\r\na Democrat and a Republican these days, so that such a change\r\nwould not in itself be an act of suicide. My own personal belief\r\nis that the organization in California on the Republican side\r\ncould be rather easily beaten, and we could do with California\r\nwhat La Follette did with Wisconsin. But I am trying not to think\r\nof politics, and I told those people who came to me that I thought\r\nmy line of work for the next few years was fixed.\r\n\r\n... No one yet knows from Mr. Taft's line of policy what kind of a\r\nPresident he will make. Everybody is giving him the benefit of the\r\ndoubt. The thing, I find, that hangs over all Presidents and other\r\npublic men here to terrify them is the fear of bad times. The\r\ngreatness of Roosevelt lay, in a sense, in his recklessness. These\r\npeople undoubtedly have the power to bring on panics whenever they\r\nwant to and to depress business, and they will exercise that power\r\nas against any administration that does not play their game, and\r\nthe \"money power,\" as we used to call it, allows the President and\r\nCongress a certain scope--a field within which it may move but if\r\nit goes outside that field and follows policies or demands\r\nmeasures which interfere with the game as played by the high\r\nfinanciers, they do not hesitate to use their \"big stick,\" which\r\nis the threat of business depression. ...\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of things to be done in our State yet before we\r\nboth pass out. ... As always, very truly yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LAWRENCE F. ABBOTT OUTLOOK\r\n\r\nWashington, September 22, 1909\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ABBOTT,-- ... President Taft's suggestion of a Commerce\r\nCourt is a very sensible one. We suggested the institution of such\r\na Court some years ago, so that the question of nullifying our\r\norder will be brought up before men who have special experience.\r\n... The trouble with the Courts is that they know nothing about\r\nthe question. Fundamentally it is not ... law but economics that\r\nwe deal with. The fixing of a rate is a matter of politics. That\r\nis the reason why I have always held that the traffic manager is\r\nthe most potent of our statesmen. So that we should have a Court\r\nthat will pass really upon the one question of confiscation--the\r\nconstitutionality of the rates fixed--and leave experienced men\r\nto deal with the economic questions. ...\r\n\r\nI have long wanted to see you and have a talk about our work. At\r\ntimes it is rather disheartening. The problem is vast, and we pass\r\nfew milestones. The one great accomplishment of the Commission, I\r\nthink, in the last three years, has been the enforcement of the\r\nlaw as against rebating. We have a small force now that is used in\r\nthis connection under my personal direction, and I think the\r\ngreatest contribution that we have made, perhaps, to the railroads\r\nhas been during the time of panic when they were kept from cutting\r\nrates directly or indirectly and throwing each other into the\r\nhands of receivers.\r\n\r\nThe great volume of our complaints comes from the territory west\r\nof the Mississippi River and practically all of the larger cities\r\nin the inter-mountain country have complaints pending before us\r\nattacking the reasonableness of the rates charged them, and it is\r\nto give consideration to these that the Commission, as a body,\r\ngoes West the first of the month. ...\r\n\r\nI have just returned from a trip to Europe, and I find that what I\r\nsaid two or three years ago about the United States being the most\r\nConservative of the civilized countries is absolutely true.\r\n\r\nBy the way, at the Sorbonne at Paris they are exhibiting the chair\r\nin which President Roosevelt will sit when he comes to deliver his\r\naddress and I am thinking that he will have quite as hearty a\r\nreception in Paris as in any of our cities.\r\n\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. WIGMORE\r\n\r\nWashington, December 3, 1909\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DOCTOR,--... I think there is but little doubt that De\r\nVries will receive the appointment, though of course everything\r\nhere is in absolute chaos. ... The best symptom in my own case is\r\nthat I have been called in twice to consult over proposed\r\namendments to the law, and the President's [Taft's] reference\r\nthereto in his forthcoming message. He seems to think my judgment\r\nworth something--more than I do myself, in fact--for down in my\r\nheart, though I do not let anybody see it, I am really a modest\r\ncreature.\r\n\r\nSince my return from the West we have had one merry round of\r\nsickness in the house ... but all are on their feet once more and\r\nas gay as they can be with a more or less grumpy head of the\r\nhousehold in the neighborhood, (assuming for the nonce that I am\r\nthe head of the household).\r\n\r\nThe President is going to appoint Lurton. [Footnote: To the\r\nSupreme Bench.] He should have said so when he made up his mind to\r\ndo it, which was immediately after Peckham's death. He would have\r\nsaved himself an immense amount of trouble. Lurton seems to have\r\nbeen very hostile to the Interstate Commerce Commission, and is\r\ntoo old, but otherwise I hear nothing said against him. I really\r\nwould like to see Bowers put on the bench very much. He has made a\r\nvery favorable impression here, and is a clear lawyer, a very\r\nstrong man, and in sympathy with Federal control that's real.\r\n\r\nBy the way, I had a talk the other day with Attorney General\r\nWickersham regarding the treatment of criminals, and I believe you\r\ncan secure through him the initiation of an enlightened policy in\r\nthis matter. He told me that he was going to make some\r\nrecommendations in his report, and perhaps the President may deal\r\nwith the matter slightly in his message. Wickersham is a\r\nthoroughly modern proposition, and as he has charge of all the\r\npenitentiaries, and his recommendations, with relation to parole\r\nand such things, absolutely go with the President, I believe you\r\ncould do more good in an hour's talk with him than you could\r\neffect in a year otherwise. If you could run down, during the\r\nholiday vacation, I would bring you two together for a talk on\r\nthis matter, and you, also, might take up the very live question\r\nwith the President of cutting off red-tape in the courts. Give my\r\nlove to Mrs. Wigmore, and tell her, too, that we would be most\r\ndelighted to see her here. Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nOn December 9,1909, President Taft reappointed Franklin K. Lane as\r\na member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. FRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nEn route to California, Monday, March [1910]\r\n\r\n... I have spent a rather pleasant day reading, and looking at\r\nthis great desert of New Mexico and Arizona. No one on board that\r\nI know or care to know, but the big sky and my books keep me busy.\r\nDo you remember that picture in the Corcoran Gallery with a wee\r\nline of land at the bottom and a great high reach of blue sky\r\nabove, covering nine-tenths of the canvas? I have thought of it\r\noften to-day--\"the high, irrepressible sky.\" It is moonlight and\r\nthe rare air gives physical tone, so that I feel a bit more like\r\nmyself, as was, than is ordinary. ...\r\n\r\nI have thought of a lecture to-day and you must keep this letter\r\nas a reminder and make me do it one of these days: THE PROBLEMS OF\r\nRAILROAD REGULATION. THE TRAFFIC MANAGER AS A STATESMAN: THE\r\nUNEARNED INCREMENT OF OUR RAILROADS.\r\n\r\nAnd another: THE NEED OF A WORLD BANK: INTERNATIONAL AND\r\nINDEPENDENT FINANCIAL AUTHORITY, which shall fix standards of\r\nvalue, based on no one metal or commodity, but on a great number\r\nof staples.\r\n\r\nI have thought much of the farm. It will be so far away and so\r\nimpracticable of use! But such an anchor to windward, for two most\r\nhand-to-mouth spendthrifts! ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\nWashington, April 29, 1910\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. ROOSEVELT,--Mr. Kellogg tells me that he expects to\r\nsee you in Europe, and I avail myself of his offer to carry a word\r\nof welcome to you, inasmuch as I must leave for Europe the day\r\nafter your arrival in New York, the President having appointed me\r\nas a delegate to the International Railway Congress at Berne.\r\n\r\nThe country is awaiting you anxiously--not out of mere curiosity\r\nto know what your attitude will be, but to lead it, to give it\r\ndirection. The public opinion which you developed in favor of the\r\n\"square deal\" is stronger to-day than when you left, and your\r\npersonal following is larger to-day than it ever has been. There\r\nis no feeling (or if there is any it is negligible) that the\r\nPresident [Taft] has been consciously disloyal to the policies\r\nwhich you inaugurated or to his public promises. He is patriotic,\r\nconscientious, and lovable. This was your own view as expressed to\r\nme, and this view has been confirmed by my personal experience\r\nwith him. It is also, I believe, the judgment of the country at\r\nlarge. But the people do not feel that they control the government\r\nor that their interests will be safeguarded by a relationship that\r\nis purely diplomatic between the White House and Congress. In\r\nshort we have a new consciousness of Democracy, largely resulting\r\nfrom your administration, and it is such that the character of\r\ngovernment which satisfied the people of twenty years ago is found\r\nlacking to-day. Practically all the criticism to which this\r\nadministration has been subjected arises out of the feeling of the\r\npeople that their opinions and desires are not sufficiently\r\nconsulted, and they are suspicious of everything and everybody\r\nthat is not open and frank with them.\r\n\r\nOutside of a few of the larger states the entire country is\r\ninsurgent, and insurgency means revolt against taking orders. The\r\nprospect is that the next House will be Democratic, but the\r\nDemocrats apparently lack a realization of the many new problems\r\nupon which the country is divided. Their success would not\r\nindicate the acceptance of any positive program of legislation; it\r\nwould be a vote of lack of confidence in the Republican party\r\nbecause it has allowed apparent party interest to rise superior to\r\npublic good. The prospect is that every measure which Congress\r\nwill pass at this session will be wise and in line with your\r\npolicies, but the people do not feel that THEY are passing the\r\nbills.\r\n\r\nI have presumed to say this much, thinking that perhaps you would\r\nregard my opinion as entirely unbiased, and in the hope that I\r\nmight throw some light upon what I regard as the fundamental\r\ntrouble which has to be dealt with. Whether you choose to re-enter\r\npolitical life or not, men of all parties desire your leadership\r\nand will accept your advice as they will that of none other.\r\n\r\nPardon me for this typewriting, but I thought that you might\r\nprefer a letter in this form which you could read to one in my own\r\nhand which you could not read. Believe me, as always, faithfully\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nFrom Berlin, Lane received from Theodore Roosevelt, dated May 13,\r\n1910, these lines,--\r\n\r\n\" ... I think your letter most interesting. As far as I can judge\r\nyou have about sized up the situation right. With hearty good\r\nwishes, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nTHEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. WIGMORE\r\n\r\nWashington, March 2, 1911\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--No other letter that I have received has done me as\r\nmuch good or given me as much pleasure, or has been as much of a\r\nstimulus, as has yours. The fact that you took the time to go\r\nthrough the REPORT so carefully is an evidence of a friendship\r\nthat is beyond all price, and of which I feel most unworthy. I\r\nhave had the figures checked over, resulting in some slight\r\nchanges, and will send you a revised copy as soon as it is\r\nprinted. The newspaper criticisms are generally very friendly,\r\nalthough the FINANCIAL CHRONICLE, the WALL STREET JOURNAL, and\r\nother railway organs are extremely bitter. The Western papers do\r\nnot seem to have been very much elated over the decision. It has\r\nappeared to me from the beginning as if they had been \"fixed\" in\r\nadvance and that their reports were always biased for the\r\nrailroads, but the country at large will realize, I think, before\r\nlong, that the decisions are sound, sensible, and in the public\r\ninterest. Some of the least narrow of the railroad men also take\r\nthis view. The best editorial I have seen is in the New York\r\nEVENING POST. Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nP. S. I got this note from Roosevelt this morning, headed THE\r\nOUTLOOK:--\r\n\r\n\"Fine! I am really greatly obliged to you, and I shall read the\r\nREPORT with genuine interest. More power to your elbow! Faithfully\r\nyours.\"\r\n\r\n\"This report was known,\" Commissioner Harlan explains, \"as the\r\nWestern Advance Rate Case. It was one of the first of the great\r\ncases covering many commodities and applying over largely extended\r\nterritories. In his opinion denying the rate advances proposed by\r\nthe carriers, Commissioner Lane discussed the Commission's new\r\npowers of suspending the operation of increased rates pending\r\ninvestigation and the burden of proof in such cases. He marshalled\r\na vast array of facts and figures and announced conclusions that\r\nwere accepted as convincing by the public at large. He then\r\npointed out that the laws enforced by the Commission sought\r\ndominion over private capital for no other purpose than to secure\r\nthe public against injustice and thereby make capital itself more\r\nsecure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM R. WHEELER TRAFFIC BUREAU, MERCHANTS' EXCHANGE SAN\r\nFRANCISCO, CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nWashington, June 27, 1911\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR,--Adverting to yours of June 22, IN RE express rates, I\r\nbeg to advise that nothing can be added to my previous letter\r\nunless it is the expression of my personal opinion that a rate\r\nshould not be made for the carriage of 20,000 pound shipments by\r\nexpress.\r\n\r\nWe are receiving daily similar complaints to yours, respecting the\r\nnonadjustment of express rates, and if you will call at this\r\noffice we shall be pleased to reveal the reason for our failure,\r\nhitherto, to grant the relief desired. It is extremely warm in\r\nWashington at the present time, but if anything could add to the\r\ndisagreeableness of life in the city it is the unreasoning\r\ninsistence on the part of the traffic bureaus of the country that\r\nexpress rates shall be fixed overnight.\r\n\r\nI desire to say that I have given some year or two of more or less\r\nprofane contemplation to this question, and have now engaged a\r\nlarge corps of men, under the direction of Mr. Frank Lyon as\r\nattorney for the Commission, to seek a way out of the inextricable\r\nmaze of express company figures. Whether we will be able to find\r\nthe light before the Infinite Hand that controls our destinies\r\ncuts short the cord, is a question to which no certain answer can\r\nbe given. Would you kindly advise the importunate members of a\r\nmost worthy institution, that express rates to San Francisco\r\npossess me as an obsessment. My prayer is at night interfered with\r\nby consideration of the question--\"What should the 100 pound rate\r\nbe by Wells Fargo & Co. from New York to San Francisco?\" And at\r\nnight often I am aroused from sleep, feeling confident in my\r\ndreams that the mystic figure of \"a just and reasonable rate,\"\r\nunder Section One, on 100-pound shipments to San Francisco, had\r\nbeen determined, and awaken with a joyous cry upon my lips, to\r\ndiscover that life has been made still more unhappy by the torture\r\nof the subconscious mind during sleep.\r\n\r\nNo doubt your shippers are being treated unfairly, both by the\r\nexpress companies and by the Interstate Commerce Commission. This\r\nis a cruel world. Congress itself adds to the torture, by almost\r\ndaily referring to us some bill touching express rates or parcels\r\npost, or some such similar service, and while the thermometer\r\nstands at 117 degrees in the shade we are requested to advise as\r\nto whether express companies should not be abolished. It has only\r\nbeen by the exercise of a rare and unusual degree of self-control\r\non my part, and by long periods of prayer, that I have refrained\r\nfrom advising Congress that I thought express companies should be\r\nabolished and designating the place to which they should be\r\nrelegated.\r\n\r\nAs perhaps you may have heard, I shall visit the Pacific Coast in\r\nperson during the next few weeks, and there I trust I may have the\r\npleasure of meeting you and your noble Governing Committees, to\r\nwhom I shall explain in person and in detail the difficulties\r\nattaching to the solution of this problem. ... Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LAWRENCE F. ABBOTT OUTLOOK\r\n\r\nWashington, December 4, 1911\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ABBOTT,-- ... We are making history fast these days, and\r\nat the bottom of it all lies the idea, in the minds of the\r\nAmerican people, that they are going to use this machine they call\r\nthe Government. For the centuries and centuries that have passed,\r\ngovernment has been something imposed from above, to which the\r\nsubject or citizen must submit. For the first century of our\r\nnational life this idea has held good. Now, however, the people\r\nhave grown in imagination, so that they appreciate the fact that\r\nthe government is very little more than a cooperative institution\r\nin which there is nothing inherently sacred, excepting in so far\r\nas it is a crystallization of general sentiment and is a good\r\nworking arrangement. And the feeling with relation to big\r\nbusiness, when we get down to the bottom of it, is that if men\r\nhave made these tremendous fortunes out of privileges granted by\r\nthe whole people, we can correct this by a change in our laws.\r\nThey do not object to men making any amount of money so long as\r\nthe individual makes it, but if the Government makes it for him,\r\nthat is another matter.\r\n\r\nI have been meeting ... with some of the committees, in Congress\r\nand out, that are drafting bills regulating trusts, and I expect\r\nsomething by no means radical as a starter.\r\n\r\nYou ask as to leadership in both Houses. There is not much in the\r\nLower House that can be relied upon to do constructive work, so\r\nfar as I can discover. Our Democratic leaders all wear hobble\r\nskirts. But in the Senate there is some very good stuff.\r\n\r\nI expect to be in New York in January, and then I hope to see you.\r\nVery truly yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nWhen he was running for Governor in 1902, Lane made prison reform\r\none of the foremost issues of his campaign. Several years later\r\nwhen a movement was started petitioning the Governor to parole\r\nAbraham Ruef, who had served a part of his term in the\r\npenitentiary for bribery in San Francisco, Lane signed the\r\npetition. This brought a letter of remonstrance from his friend\r\nCharles McClatchy, editor and owner of the Sacramento Bee, who\r\nfelt that such a movement was ill-timed and not in the interest of\r\nthe public good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES K. MCCLATCHY SACRAMENTO BEE\r\n\r\nWashington, December 12, 1911\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHARLES,--I have your letter regarding the paroling of\r\nAbraham Ruef, and, far from taking offense at what you say, I know\r\nthat it expresses the opinion of probably the great body of our\r\npeople, but I have long thought that we dealt with criminals in a\r\nmanner which tended to keep them as criminals and altogether\r\nopposed to the interests of society. I am not sentimental on this\r\nproposition, but I think I am sensible. We are dealing with men\r\nconvicted of crime more harshly and more unreasonably than we deal\r\nwith dogs. Our fundamental mistake is that we utterly ignore the\r\nfact that there is such a thing as psychology. We are treating\r\nprisoners with the methods of five hundred years ago, before\r\nanything was known about the nature of the human mind. ... There\r\nare, of course, certain kinds of men who should for society's sake\r\nbe kept in prison as long as they live, just as there are kinds of\r\ninsane people that should be kept in insane asylums until they\r\ndie. ...\r\n\r\nI think if you will get the thought into your mind that our\r\npresent penal system is Silurian and unscientific--the same to-day\r\nas it was 10,000 years ago--you will see my stand-point. Our\r\npenitentiaries develop criminals, they make criminals out of men\r\nwho are not criminals to begin with--boys, for instance. They\r\ndebase and degrade men. The state by its system of punishment\r\nreaches into the heart of a man and plucks out his very soul. I am\r\nspeaking of men who are when they enter responsive to good\r\nimpulses. ...\r\n\r\nI thoroughly appreciate the spirit in which you have written me,\r\nand I hope that you will get my point of view. I have known Abe\r\nRuef for over twenty-five years. He was a perfectly straight young\r\nman and anxious to help in San Francisco. I do not know the\r\ninfluences that turned him into the direction that he took, but I\r\nam absolutely certain that that man has suffered mental tortures\r\ngreater than any that he would have ever suffered if he had gone\r\nto a physical hell of fire. He may appear brave, but he is in\r\nfact, I will warrant you, a heart-broken man, because he has\r\nfailed of realizing his own decent ideals. ... He never was my\r\nfriend, politically, socially, or otherwise, but my judgment is\r\nthat society will be better off if he is allowed the limited\r\nfreedom that a parole gives and given an opportunity to live up to\r\nhis own ideal of Abe Ruef.\r\n\r\nRegards to Val, your wife, and family. As always, faithfully\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CHARLES K. MCCLATCHY SACRAMENTO BEE\r\n\r\n[Washington, January, 1912]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHARLES,--I have your note regarding Ruef. ... It seems to\r\nme you have made one good point against me, and only one,--that\r\nthere are poor men in jail who ought to be paroled at the end of a\r\nyear. Very well, why not parole them? If they are men who have\r\nbeen reached by public opinion and are subject to it, I see no\r\nreason why they should be kept in jail. Every case must be dealt\r\nwith by itself and to each case should be given the same kind of\r\ntreatment that I give to Ruef. You will be advocating this thing\r\nyourself one of these days, calling it Christian and civilized and\r\ndenouncing those who do not agree with you as being barbarians. It\r\nmay be that Ruef fooled me when he was just out of college, but I\r\nwas a member of the Municipal Reform League which John H. Wigmore,\r\nnow Dean of the Northwestern University Law School, Ruef and\r\nmyself started. It did not last very long, but I think that Ruef\r\nwas as zealous as any of us for good government.\r\n\r\nWith many wishes for the New Year, believe me always, my dear\r\nCharles, yours faithfully,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS LONDON, ENGLAND\r\n\r\nDecember 13, 1911\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BURNS,--I have felt grievously hurt, at hearing from\r\nPfeiffer several times, that you had written him, and nary a word\r\nto me. The idea that I should write to you when you had nothing in\r\nthe world to do but write me, never entered my head. I want you to\r\nunderstand distinctly the position which you now occupy in the\r\nminds of your friends. You are a gentleman of leisure, traveling\r\nin Europe with an invalid wife, necessarily bored, and anxious to\r\nmeet with anything that will give you an interesting life. Under\r\nthe circumstances, you may relieve your mind at any time, of any\r\nintellectual bile, by correspondence. ... If you wish something\r\nserious to do, I will formally direct you to make a report upon\r\nRailway Rates and Railway Service in Europe. This will give you\r\nsome diversion in between your attacks of religion and\r\narchitecture.\r\n\r\nPfeiffer, I presume, has returned from the Far West, but so far I\r\nhave not heard from him. The last letter I got was from the\r\nYosemite. He seems to have been enchanted with that country. He\r\nsays there is nothing in Europe to compare with it. It is splendid\r\nto see a fellow of his age, and with all of his learning, keep up\r\nhis enthusiasm. It seems to me that he is more appreciative and\r\nbuoyant than he was twenty years ago, and he is really very sane.\r\nHis sympathies, unlike yours, are with the present and not with\r\nthe dead past.\r\n\r\nYou will be interested in knowing that Mr. T. Roosevelt is likely\r\nto be the next Republican nominee for President. Within the last\r\nsix weeks it has become quite manifest that Taft cannot be\r\nelected. ... And so you see, the whirligig of time has made\r\nanother turn. Big Business in New York is looking to Roosevelt as\r\na statesman who is practical. The West regards him as the champion\r\nof the plain people. He is keeping silent, but no doubt like the\r\nnegro lady he is quite willing to be \"fo'ced.\"\r\n\r\nOn the Democratic side all of the forces have united to destroy\r\nWilson, who is the strongest man in the West. The bosses are all\r\nagainst him. They recently produced an application which he had\r\nmade for a pension, under the Carnegie Endowment Fund for\r\nTeachers, which had been allowed to lie idle, unnoticed for a year\r\nor so after its rejection, but owing to campaign emergencies was\r\nproduced, at this happy moment, to show that Wilson wanted a\r\npension. As a Philadelphia poet whom you never heard of says:--\r\n\r\n    \"Ah, what a weary travel is our act,\r\n    Here, there, and back again, to win some prize,\r\n    Those who are wise their voyage do contract\r\n    To the safe space between each others' eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThis line is in keeping with my reputation as an early Victorian.\r\n... Do write me some good long letters. You have a better literary\r\nstyle than any man who ever wrote a letter to me, and I love you\r\nfor the prejudices that are yours. Give my love to your wife. As\r\nalways yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THEODORE ROOSEVELT\r\n\r\nWashington, December 10, 1911\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COLONEL,--I have been thinking over what I said yesterday,\r\nand I am going to presume upon my friendship and, I may say, my\r\naffection for you to make a suggestion:\r\n\r\nEven though the call comes from a united party and under\r\ncircumstances the most flattering, do not accept it unless you are\r\nconvinced of two things: (1) that you are needed from a national\r\nstandpoint and not merely from a party standpoint; (2) that you\r\nare certain of election.\r\n\r\nSacrifice for one's country is splendid, but sacrifice for one's\r\nparty is foolish. You must feel assured before acceding to the\r\ncall, which I believe will certainly come, that it is more than\r\nparty-wide, and that it is sufficiently strong to overcome the\r\ntrend toward Democratic success. If I were asked I would say that\r\nI think both of these conditions are present--that the desire to\r\nhave you again is much broader than any party, and so large that\r\nit would insure your victory;--but no man is as wise a judge of\r\nthese things as the man himself whose fortunes are at stake.\r\n\r\nThanking you again for the pleasure of a luncheon, believe me, as\r\nalways, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoosevelt in a letter marked PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL replied:--\r\n... \"That is a really kind and friendly letter from you, and I\r\nappreciate it. Now I agree absolutely with you that I have no\r\nbusiness under any circumstances to accept any such call, even in\r\nthe greatly improbable event of its coming, unless I am convinced\r\nthat the need is National, a need of the people and not merely a\r\nneed of the Party. But as for considering my own chances in any\r\nsuch event, my dear fellow, I simply would not know how to go\r\nabout it. I am always credited with far more political sagacity\r\nthan I really possess. I act purely on public grounds and then\r\nthis proves often to be good policy too. I assure you with all\r\npossible sincerity that I have not thought and am not thinking of\r\nthe nomination, and that under no circumstances would I in the\r\nremotest degree plan to bring about my nomination. I do not want\r\nto be President again, I am not a candidate, I have not the\r\nslightest idea of becoming a candidate, and I do not for one\r\nmoment believe that any such condition of affairs will arise that\r\nwould make it necessary to consider me accepting the nomination.\r\nBut as for the effect upon my own personal fortunes, I would not\r\nknow how to consider it, because I would not have the vaguest idea\r\nwhat the effect would be, except that according to my own view it\r\ncould not but be bad and unpleasant for me personally. From the\r\npersonal standpoint I should view the nomination to the Presidency\r\nas a real and serious misfortune. Nothing would persuade me to\r\ntake it, unless it appeared that the people really wished me to do\r\na given job, which I could not honorably shirk. ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SAMUEL G. BLYTHE\r\n\r\nWashington, January 6, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SAM,--... I, too, have been reading William James. His\r\nVARIETIES OF RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE is the only philosophic work\r\nthat I was ever able to get all the way through. This thing gave\r\nme real delight for a week.\r\n\r\nHave just read Mr. John Bigelow's REMINISCENCES, or bits thereof,\r\nand find that the aforesaid John is much like another John that we\r\nknow in this city, the fine friend of the Pan-American Bureau. He\r\nseems to have been a dignified and solemn gentleman who carried on\r\ncorrespondence with a great many men for a number of years,\r\nwithout ... having indulged in a flash of humor in all his\r\nrespectable days. ...\r\n\r\nWill you support me for Supreme Court Justice? I see that I am\r\nmentioned. Between us, I am entirely ineligible, having a sense of\r\nhumor. As always yours,\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SIDNEY E. MEZES PRESIDENT, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS\r\n\r\nWashington, February 15,1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SID,--Your weather has been no worse than ours, I want you\r\nto understand; in fact, not so bad. I think the glacial period is\r\nreturning and the ice cap is moving down from the North Pole.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Bench I could not get because I am a Democrat, and the\r\nPresident could not afford to appoint another Democrat on the\r\nBench. I do not know when McKenna goes out, and I am not going to\r\nbe disturbed about it anyway. If I had not been unlucky enough to\r\nbe born in Canada I could be nominated for President this year.\r\nThings are in a devil of a condition. We could have elected\r\nWilson, hands down, if it had not been for Hearst's malevolent\r\ninfluence. He is at the bottom of all this deviltry. His aim is to\r\nkill Wilson off and nominate Clark, and Clark is in the lead now,\r\nI think. God knows whether he can beat Taft or not. It looks to me\r\nas if Taft will be nominated. I have a feeling somehow that the\r\nRoosevelt boom won't materialize.\r\n\r\nMy love to the Missis and to Mr. House. As always yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. WIGMORE\r\n\r\nWashington, February 19, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--For two weeks there has been standing on my desk a\r\nmost elegantly bound set of your CASES ON TORTS sent to me by\r\nLittle, Brown & Co. at your request. You do not need to be told, I\r\nknow, how much I appreciate a thing that comes from you and how\r\npoverty stricken I am when it comes to making adequate return. I\r\ncan prove that I have been working hard, but my work does not\r\ncrystallize into anything which is worth sending to a friend.\r\n\r\nThe fact is that I have never worked as hard in my life as I have\r\nlately. I get to my office about nine, and without going out of my\r\nroom (for I take my lunch at my desk), stay until six, and work at\r\nhome every night until half past eleven, and then take a volume of\r\nessays or poems to bed with me for half or three-quarters of an\r\nhour, and so to sleep.\r\n\r\nIf the man in the White House had as much sense as I have, he\r\nwould name you for the Supreme Bench without asking, and \"draft\"\r\nyou, as Roosevelt says. By the way, I gave the suggestion of\r\n\"draft\" in a talk I had with him a month or so ago.\r\n\r\nThe political situation is interesting, but altogether un-lovely.\r\n... It looks as if Clark might be the nominee on the Democratic\r\nside. Taft is gaining in strength, and somehow I cannot feel that\r\nRoosevelt will ever be in it, although you know how I like him.\r\nThe situation seems a bit artificial.\r\n\r\nGive my love to Mrs. John. As always yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, February 23, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,-- ... Yesterday I delivered an address before the\r\nUniversity of Virginia on A Western View of Tradition--which when\r\nit is printed I will send out to you--and in the afternoon was\r\ntaken up to Jefferson's home, Monticello. It is on a mountain, the\r\ntop of which he scraped off. It overlooks the whole surrounding\r\ncountry, most of which at that time he owned. He planned the whole\r\nhouse himself, even to the remotest details, the cornices and the\r\ncarvings on the mantels, the kind of lumber of which the floors\r\nwere to be made, the character of the timbers used, the carving of\r\nthe capitals on the columns, the folding ladder that was used to\r\nwind up the clock over the doorway, the registers on the porch\r\nthat recorded the direction in which the wind was coming, as moved\r\nby the weather-vane on the roof, the little elevator beside the\r\nfireplace ... and a thousand other details.\r\n\r\n... I would like nothing better if I had any kind of skill in\r\nusing my hands than to take a year off and build a house. It is a\r\nreal religion to create something, and you do not need a great\r\ndeal of money to make a very beautiful little place. You must have\r\none large room, and the house must be on some elevation, and you\r\nmust get water, water, and water. ... It is water that makes land\r\nvaluable in California or anywhere else. Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CARL SNYDER\r\n\r\nWashington, March 6, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CARL,--I have this minute for the first time seen the copy\r\nof COLLIER'S, for February 24, 1912, and therefore for the first\r\ntime my eyes lighted upon your most delicious roast of the\r\nCommerce Court. ...\r\n\r\nI do not know what the outcome of this movement will be. The only\r\nsettled policy of government is inertia. The House of\r\nRepresentatives Committee on Appropriations, I believe, proposes\r\nto abolish the appropriation for the Court, which looks like a\r\ncowardly way to get at the thing, but perhaps it is most\r\neffective. However, I really doubt if they will have the nerve to\r\ndo this. It is a mighty critical year, I think, in our history. It\r\nlooks to me as if the reactionaries were going to get possession\r\nof both parties, and that a third party will be needed and nobody\r\nwill have the nerve to start it. Roosevelt has got everything west\r\nof the Mississippi excepting Utah and Wyoming, in my judgment.\r\nThat he will be able to get the nomination I am not so sure; but\r\nhe does not care a tinker's damn whether he gets it himself or\r\nnot. That is the worst of it because the people won't give\r\nanything to a man that he does not want. ... Well, we are living\r\nin mighty interesting times anyway.\r\n\r\nAs always yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nOn February 22, 1912, Lane delivered the annual address at the\r\nUniversity of Virginia. He spoke on American Tradition, saying\r\nthat as Americans are physically, industrially, and socially the\r\n\"heirs of all the ages\" our supreme tradition is a \"hatred of\r\ninjustice.\" That one of the great experiments that a Democracy\r\nshould make is to find a more equitable distribution of wealth\r\n\"without destroying individual initiative or blasting individual\r\ncapacity and imagination.\" This address brought a letter from\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes, Justice of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nMarch 17, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIR,--Let me thank you at once for your Virginia address,\r\nwhich I have just received and just read--read with the greatest\r\npleasure. I admire its eloquence, its imagination, its style. I\r\nsympathize with its attitude and with most of its implications. I\r\ngain heart from its tone of hope. I am old--by the calendar at\r\nleast--and at times am more melancholy, so that it does me good to\r\nhear the note of courage. One implication may carry conclusions to\r\nwhich I think I ought to note my disagreement,--the reference to\r\nunequal distribution. I think the prevailing fallacy is to\r\nconfound ownership with consumption of products. Ownership is a\r\ngate, not a stopping place. You tell me little when you tell me\r\nthat Rockefeller or the United States is the owner. What I want to\r\nknow is who consumes the annual product, and for many years I have\r\nbeen saying and believing that to think straight one should look\r\nat the stream of annual products and ask what change one would\r\nmake in that under any REGIME. The luxuries of the few are a drop\r\nin the bucket--the crowd now has all there is. The difference\r\nbetween private and public ownership, it seems to me, is mainly in\r\nthe natural selection of those most competent to foresee the\r\nfuture and to direct labor into the most productive channels, and\r\nthe greater poignancy of the illusion of self-seeking under which\r\nthe private owner works. The real problem, under socialism as well\r\nas under individualism, is to ascertain, under the external\r\neconomic and inevitable conditions, the equilibrium of social\r\ndesires. The real struggle is between the different groups of\r\nproducers of the several objects of social desire. The bogey\r\ncapital is simply the force of all the other groups against the\r\none that is selling its product, trying to get that product for\r\nthe least it can. Capital is society purchasing and consuming--\r\nLabor is society producing. The laborers unfortunately are often\r\nencouraged to think capital something up in the sky which they are\r\nwaiting for a Franklin to bring down into their jars. I think that\r\nis a humbug and lament that I so rarely hear what seem to me the\r\ncommonplaces that I have uttered, expressed. Your fine address has\r\nset me on my hobby and you have fallen a victim to the charm of\r\nyour own words. Very truly, yours,\r\n\r\nO. W. HOLMES\r\n\r\nP. S. Of course I am speaking only of economics not of political\r\nor sentimental considerations--both very real, but as to which all\r\nthat one can say is, if you are sure that you want to go to the\r\nshow and have money enough to buy a ticket, go ahead, but don't\r\ndelude yourself with the notion that you are doing an economic\r\nact. I make the only return I can in the form of the single speech\r\nI have made for the last nine years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT\r\n\r\nWashington, March 20, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. JUSTICE,--I sincerely thank you for the warmth and\r\ngenerosity of your comment on my Virginia speech. Your economic\r\nphilosophy is fundamentally, I think, the same as mine--that the\r\nwealth produced is a social product. And men may honestly differ\r\nas to how best that stream of foods and other satisfactions may be\r\nincreased in volume, or more widely distributed. May I carry your\r\nfigure of the stream further by suggesting that the riparian owner\r\nin England has the superior right, but in an arid country the\r\ncommon law rule is abandoned because under new conditions it does\r\nnot make for the greatest public good? The land adjoining feels\r\nthe need of the water, and society takes from one to give to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe last century was devoted to steaming up in production. This\r\ncentury, it appears to me, will devote itself more definitely to\r\ndistribution. It is nonsense, of course, to say that because the\r\nrich grow richer the poor grow poorer; but the poor are not the\r\nsame poor, they, too, have found new desires. Civilization has\r\ngiven them new wants. Those desires will not be satisfied with\r\nlargesse, and with the machinery of government in their hands the\r\npeople are bound to experiment along economic lines. They will\r\ncertainly find that they get most when they preserve the captain\r\nof industry, but may it not be that his imagination and\r\nforethought may be commanded by society at a lower share of the\r\ngross than he has heretofore received, or in exchange for\r\nsomething of a different, perhaps of a sentimental nature? ...\r\nPlease pardon this typewritten note, but my own hand, unlike your\r\ncopper-plate, is absolutely illegible. I have been raised in a\r\ntypewriter age.\r\n\r\nAgain thanking you for your letter, believe me, with the highest\r\nregard, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. WIGMORE\r\n\r\nWashington, April 3, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--You overwhelm me. ... You have no right to say such\r\nnice things to an innocent and trusting young thing like myself.\r\nThe flat, unabashed truth is that I appreciate your letter more\r\nthan any other that I have received concerning that speech. By way\r\nof indicating the interest which it has excited I send you copies\r\nof some correspondence between Mr. Justice Holmes and myself.\r\n\r\nOur plans for the summer are very unsettled. The probability is\r\nthat we will go up to Bras D'Or Lakes, in Cape Breton, where we\r\ncan have salt-water bathing and sailing and be most primitive. I\r\nshould like greatly to run over with you to Europe, and, by way of\r\nmaking the temptation harder to resist, let me know how you expect\r\nto go, and where.\r\n\r\nGive my love to the Lady Wigmore. As ever yours,\r\n\r\nF, K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DANIEL WITTARD PRESIDENT, BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD COMPANY\r\n\r\nWashington, June 19, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. WILLARD,--That was a warm cordial note that you sent\r\nme regarding my University of Virginia address, and what you say\r\nof my sentiments confirms my own view that property must look to\r\nmen like yourself for protection in the future--men who are not\r\nblind to public sentiment and whose methods are frank. The worst\r\nenemy that capital has in the country is the man who thinks that\r\nhe can \"put one over\" on the people. An institution cannot remain\r\nsacred long which is the creator of injustice, and that is what\r\nsome of our blind friends at Chicago do not see. Very truly yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN MCNAUGHT NEW YORK WORLD\r\n\r\nWashington, March 23, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--I am very glad indeed to hear from you and to know\r\nthat you are in sympathy with my \"eloquent\" address at the\r\nUniversity of Virginia. You give me hope that I am on the right\r\ntrack. As for Harmon and representative government, you won't get\r\neither. ... Please see Mr. R. W. Emerson's Sphinx, in which occurs\r\nthis line:\r\n\r\n    \"The Lethe of Nature can't trance him again\r\n    Whose soul sees the perfect, which his eye seeks in vain.\"\r\n\r\nFancy me surrounded by maps of the express systems of the United\r\nStates, digging through the rates on uncleaned rice from Texas to\r\nthe Southeast, dribbling off poetry to a man who sits in a tall\r\ntower overlooking New York, who once had poetry which has per\r\nnecessity been smothered! Dear John, read your Bible, and in\r\nSecond Kings you will find the story of one Rehoboam, that son of\r\nSolomon, who was also for Harmon and representative government.\r\n\r\nI am looking out of the window at the funeral procession for the\r\nMaine dead, and it strikes me that our dear friend Cobb has\r\noverlooked one trick in his campaign against T. R. Of course he\r\nhas other arrows in his quiver, and no doubt this one will come\r\nlater, but why not charge T. R. with having blown up the Maine? No\r\none can prove that he did not do it. He then undoubtedly was\r\nplanning to become President and knew that he never could be\r\nunless he was given a chance to show his ability as a soldier-\r\npatriot. He stole Panama of course, and is there any reason to\r\nbelieve that a man who would steal Panama would hesitate at\r\nblowing up a battleship?\r\n\r\nI hope you ... are giving over the life of a hermit--not that I\r\nwould advise you to take to the Great White Way, but the side\r\nstreets are sometimes pleasant. As always, devotedly yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nEXPRESS CASE--CABINET APPOINTMENTS\r\n\r\n1912-1913\r\n\r\nPolitics--Democratic Convention--Nomination of Wilson --Report on\r\nExpress Case--Democratic Victory--Problems for New Administration\r\n--On Cabinet Appointments\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT SHAW REVIEW OF REVIEWS\r\n\r\nWashington, April 30, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DOCTOR,-- ... You certainly are very much in the right.\r\nEverything begins to look as if the Republican party would prove\r\nitself the Democratic party after all. Our Southern friends are so\r\nobstinate and so traditional, and so insensible to the problems of\r\nthe day, that while they are honest they are too often found in\r\nalliance with the Hearsts and Calhouns. The Republican party, on\r\nthe other hand, seems to have courage enough to take a purgative\r\nevery now and then.\r\n\r\nWe must find ways of satisfying the plain man's notion of what the\r\nfair thing is, or else worse things than the recall of judges will\r\ncome to pass. Every lawyer knows that the law has been turned into\r\na game of bridge whist. People are perfectly well satisfied that\r\nthey can submit a question to a body of fair-minded and honest\r\nmen, take their conclusion, and get rid of all our absurd rules of\r\nevidence and our unending appeals.\r\n\r\nAnd as to economic problems, people are going to solve a lot of\r\nthese along very simple lines. I think I see a great body of\r\nopinion rising in favor of the appropriation by the Government of\r\nall natural resources.\r\n\r\nWe saw a lot of the Severances while they were here. Cordy made a\r\ngreat argument in the Merger Case, but if he wins, we won't get\r\nanything more than a paper victory--another Northern Securities\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nPlease remember me very kindly to Mrs. Shaw, and believe me, as\r\nalways sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO CURT G. PFEIFFER\r\n\r\nWashington, May 21, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PFEIFFER,--I am acknowledging your note on the day when\r\nOhio votes. This is the critical day, for if T. R. wins more than\r\nhalf the delegation in Ohio, he is nominated and, I might almost\r\nsay, elected. But I find that the Democrats feel more sure of his\r\nstrength than the Republicans do. Have you noticed how extremely\r\nsmall the Democratic vote is at all of the primaries, not\r\namounting to more than one-fourth of the Republican vote?\r\n\r\n... The Democrats are in an awkward position. If Roosevelt is\r\nnominated, one wing will be fighting for Underwood, to get the\r\ndisaffected conservative strength, while the other wing will be\r\nfighting for Bryan, so as to hold as large a portion of the\r\nradical support as possible. Oh, well, we have all got to come to\r\na real division of parties along lines of tendency and temperament\r\nand have those of us who feel democratic-wise get into the same\r\nwagon, and those who fear democracy, and whose first interest is\r\nproperty, flock together on the tory side. As always, yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, July 2, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--I am off tomorrow for Baddeck, Cape Breton, where\r\nI shall probably be until the 1st of September or thereabouts--if\r\nI can endure that long period of country life and absence from the\r\npolitical excitement of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt looks, as I am writing, as if Wilson were to be nominated at\r\nBaltimore. If he is he will sweep the country; Taft won't carry\r\nthree states. [Footnote: Taft carried Vermont and Utah.] Wilson is\r\nclean, strong, high-minded and cold-blooded. To nominate him would\r\nbe a tremendous triumph for the anti-Hearst people. I have been\r\nover at the convention several times. Hearst defeated Bryan for\r\ntemporary chairman by making a compact with Murphy, Sullivan and\r\nTaggart. ... Bryan has fought a most splendid fight. I had a talk\r\nwith him. He was in splendid spirits and most cordial. The\r\nCalifornia delegation headed by Theodore Bell has been made to\r\nlook like a lot of wooden Indians. Bell himself was shouted down\r\nwith the cry of \"Hearst! Hearst!\", the last time he rose to speak.\r\nThe delegation is probably the most discredited one in the entire\r\nconvention. ...\r\n\r\nMy summer, I presume, will be put in chiefly in sailing a small\r\nyawl with Gilbert Grosvenor, rowing a boat, fishing a little, and\r\nwalking some. My diet for the next two months will consist\r\nexclusively of salmon and potatoes, cod-fish and potatoes, and\r\nmutton and potatoes.\r\n\r\nI have just completed my report in the Express Case, a copy of\r\nwhich will be sent you. It has been a most tremendous task, and\r\nthe work has not yet been completed for we have to pass upon the\r\nrates in October; but I am in surprisingly good condition--\r\nlargely, perhaps, because the weather has been so cool for the\r\nlast month ...\r\n\r\nAll happiness, old man! Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\"Lane had a long look ahead,\" says James S. Harlan, \"that often\r\nreminded one of the extraordinary prevision of Colonel Roosevelt.\r\nOne striking instance of this was in connection with this Express\r\nCase.\r\n\r\n\"Early in the progress of the investigation of express companies\r\nundertaken by him in 1911, at the request of the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission, Lane warned a group of high express officials\r\ngathered around him that unless they promptly coordinated their\r\nservice more closely to the public requirements, revised their\r\narchaic practices, readjusted and simplified their rate systems so\r\nas to eliminate discriminations, the frequent collection of double\r\ncharges and other evils, and gave the public a cheaper and a\r\nbetter service, the public would soon be demanding a parcel post.\r\n\r\n\"The suggestion was received with incredulous smiles, one of the\r\nexpress officials saying, apparently with the full approval of\r\nthem all, that a parcel post had been talked of in this country\r\nfor forty years and had never got beyond the talking point, and\r\nnever would. As a matter of fact, there was little, if any,\r\nmovement at that time in the public press or elsewhere for such a\r\nservice by the government. But Lane's alert mind had sensed in the\r\ncurrent of public thought a feeling that there was need of a\r\nquicker, simpler, and cheaper way of handling the country's small\r\npackages, and he saw no way out, other than a parcel post, if the\r\nexpress companies stood still and made no effort to meet this\r\npublic need.\r\n\r\n\"Within scarcely more than a year Congress, by the Act of August\r\n24, 1912, had authorized a parcel post and such a service was in\r\nactual operation on January 1, 1913. It was not until December of\r\nthe latter year that the express companies were ready to file with\r\nthe Commission the ingenious and entirely original system Lane had\r\ndevised for stating express rates. The form was so simple that\r\neven the casual shipper in a few minutes' study could qualify\r\nhimself for ascertaining the rates, not only to and from his own\r\nhome express station but between any other points in the country.\r\nBut by that time the carriage of the country's small parcels had\r\npermanently passed out of the hands of the express companies into\r\nthe hands of the postal service, by which Lane's unique form for\r\nstating the express rates was adopted as the general form of\r\nshowing its parcel post charges.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO Oscar S. Straus\r\n\r\nWashington, July 8, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. STRAUS,--I thank you heartily for your appreciative\r\nnote regarding my University of Virginia talk. I wanted to say\r\nsomething to those people, especially to the younger men, that\r\nwould make them doubt the wisdom of staying forever with systems\r\nand theories not adapted to our day.\r\n\r\nAs I write, word comes that Woodrow Wilson has been nominated. I\r\ndo not know him, but from what I hear he promises if elected to be\r\na real leader in the war against injustice. The world wants\r\nearnest men right now--not cynics, but men who BELIEVE, whether\r\nrightly or wrongly; and the reason that the East is so much less\r\nprogressive as we say, than the West, is because the East is made\r\nup so largely of cynics.\r\n\r\nThanking you once more for your appreciative words, believe me,\r\nsincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER PRESIDENT, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nBaddeck, Nova Scotia, July 81, [1912]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. WHEELER,--Your letter followed me here, where at least\r\none can breathe. This really is a most beautiful country filled\r\nwith self-respecting Gaelic-speaking Scotch from the islands of\r\nthe north--crofters driven here to make place for sheep and fine\r\nestates on their ancestral homes in the Highlands.\r\n\r\nI am proud of your words of commendation. The express job is the\r\nbiggest one yet. I believe we've done a real service both to the\r\ncountry and to the express companies. The latter will probably\r\nlive if their service and their rates improve. Otherwise the\r\nGovernment will put them out of business, requiring the railroads\r\nto give fast service for any forwarder, as in Germany.\r\n\r\nPolitically, things look Wilson to me. Taft won't be in sight at\r\nthe finish. It will be a run between Wilson and T. R. I can't name\r\nfive states that Taft is really likely to carry. My friends in\r\nMassachusetts say Wilson will win there, and so in Maine. Well, I\r\nsuppose you and I are in the same sad situation--eager to break\r\ninto the fight but bound not to do it. Do you know I believe that\r\nT. R. has discovered, and just discovered, that it is our destiny\r\nto be a Democracy. Hence the enthusiasm which Wall Street calls\r\nwhiskey. ... Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K, LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, September 17, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--I am mighty glad to get your Labor Day letter,\r\nbut sorry that its note is not more cheerful and gay. I can quite\r\nunderstand your position though. We are all obsessed with the\r\ndesire to be of some use and unwilling to take things as they are.\r\nI do not know a pair of more rankly absurd idealists than you and\r\nmyself, and along with idealism goes discontent. We do not see the\r\nthing that satisfies us, and we can not abide resting with the\r\nthing that does not satisfy us. We are of the prods in the world,\r\nthe bit of acid that is thrown upon it to test it, the spur which\r\nmakes the lazy thing move on.\r\n\r\nThis summer I saw a great deal of a man ... [who was] perfectly\r\ncomplacent. ... And I noticed that he took no acids of any kind--\r\nnever a pickle, nor vinegar, nor salad--but would heap half a\r\nroll of butter on a single sheet of bread and eat sardines whole.\r\nAnd I just came to the conclusion that there was something in a\r\nfellow's stomach that accounted for his temperament. If I ever get\r\nthe time I am going to try and work out the theory. The contented\r\npeople are those who generate their own acid and have an appetite\r\nfor fats, while the discontented people are those whose craving is\r\nfor acids. A lack of a sense of humor and a love for concrete\r\nfacts, as opposed to dreams, goes along with the first\r\ntemperament. You just turn this thing over and see if there is not\r\nsomething in it. I am long past the stage of trying to correct\r\nmyself; I am just trying to understand a lot of things--why they\r\nare. ...\r\n\r\nF. K L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. WIGMORE\r\n\r\nWashington, July 3, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--Of course you may keep the Napoleon book. It is\r\nintended for you. Your criticism of T. R.'s literary style is\r\nappreciated, and no doubt he lacks in precision of thought.\r\n\r\nNow we shall have a chance to see what a college president can do\r\nas President of the United States. I believe Wilson will be\r\nelected. What a splendid jump in three years that man has made!\r\nThey tell me he is very cold-blooded. We need a cold-blooded\r\nfellow these days ...\r\n\r\nSeptember 21, 1912\r\n\r\n... You will by this time have picked up all the politics of the\r\ntime. Wilson is strong, but not stronger than he was when\r\nnominated. T. R. is gaining strength daily, that is my best guess.\r\nHe has the laboring man with him most enthusiastically but not\r\nunanimously, of course. The far West--Pacific Coast--is his. All\r\nthe railroad men and the miners ...\r\n\r\nI am not sure of Wilson. He is not \"wise\" to modern conditions, I\r\nfear. Tearing up the tariff won't change many prices. Doesn't he\r\nseem to talk too much like a professor and too little like a\r\nstatesman? Hearst is knifing him for all he is worth. He has fixed\r\nin the workingmen's minds that Wilson favors Chinese immigration.\r\n\r\nWell, when am I to see you again? And how is Mrs. John? How I do\r\nwish you were here! As always,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Timothy Spellacy\r\n\r\nWashington, September 30, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR TIM,--I have your fine, long letter of September 23, and\r\nthis is no more than just an acknowledgment. I am glad to know\r\nthat you are taking so hearty an interest in the campaign. It is\r\nreally too bad that you did not stay longer in Baltimore and see\r\nBryan win out all along the line.\r\n\r\nI don't want a position in the Cabinet. I am not looking for any\r\nfurther honors, but I want to help Wilson make a success of his\r\nadministration, for I think he will be elected. I am afraid that\r\nhe will become surrounded by Southern reactionaries--men of his\r\nown blood and feeling, who are not of the Northern and more\r\nprogressive type. We have got to cut some sharp corners in doing\r\nthe things that are right. By this I don't mean that we will do\r\nanything that is wrong; but from the standpoint of the Southern\r\nDemocrat it is illegal to have a strong central government--one\r\nthat is effective--and we have got to have such a government if we\r\nare going to hold possession of the Nation. The people want things\r\ndone. Wilson is a bit too conservative for me, but maybe when he\r\nrealizes the necessity for strength he will be for it.\r\n\r\nI am sorry for B--. Poor chap! His alliance with Hearst undid\r\nyears of good work ... As always yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Adolph C. Miller\r\n\r\nWashington, October 18, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ADOLPH,--I have postponed until the last minute writing\r\nyou regarding my proposed visit in California. I see now clearly\r\nthat it is impossible for me to get out there this fall. The\r\nExpress Case ... is still on my hands, and with all of my energy I\r\nshall not be able to get rid of it until the first of the year at\r\nleast ... Moreover (and this is a personal matter that I wish you\r\nwould not say anything about) ... I am doing my work in a great\r\ndeal of pain, and have been for the last three or four weeks ... I\r\ncannot work as hard as I did some time ago ...\r\n\r\nI rebel at sickness as much as I do at death. The scheme of\r\nexistence does not appeal to me, at the moment, as the most\r\nperfect which a highly imaginative Creator could have invented. My\r\ntranscendental philosophy seems a pretty good working article when\r\nthings are going smoothly, but it is not quite equal to hard\r\npractical strain, I fear.\r\n\r\nPolitically things look like Wilson, though I suppose T. R. will\r\nget California and a lot of other states. I think he will beat\r\nTaft badly. The new party has come to stay, and it will be a\r\ntremendous influence for good. I don't take any stock in the talk\r\nabout T. R's personal ambition being his controlling motive. I\r\nthink that he has found a religious purpose in life to which he\r\ncan devote himself the rest of his days, not to get himself into\r\noffice but to keep things moving along right lines.\r\n\r\nRemember me most kindly to your wife and President Wheeler. As\r\nalways yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo William F. McCombs Chairman, Democratic National Committee\r\n\r\nWashington, October 19,1912\r\n\r\nDear Mr. McCombs,--I cannot go to California and make speeches for\r\nGovernor Wilson without resigning from the Commission. Four years\r\nago two Republican members of the Commission were strongly urged\r\nat a critical time in the campaign to get into Mr. Taft's fight so\r\nas to help with the labor vote. I insisted that they should not do\r\nit, and the matter was brought before the Commission, and we then\r\ndecided that no member of the Commission should take part in\r\npolitics. So you see when the telegrams began to come in this\r\nyear, urging that I go out to California and the other Pacific\r\nCoast states, I was compelled to say that I was stopped by my\r\nposition of four years ago.\r\n\r\nI have never wanted to get into a campaign as much as I have this\r\none. Governor Wilson represents all that I have been fighting for,\r\nfor the last twenty years in my State; but I think that it would\r\nbe almost fatal to the independence and high repute of this\r\nCommission for its members to take part in a national campaign. We\r\nhave so much power that we can exercise upon the railroads and\r\nupon railroad men that any announcement made by a member of this\r\nCommission could properly be construed as a threat or a suggestion\r\nthat should be heeded by the wise. I know that this view of the\r\nmatter will appeal to you as entirely sensible when you reflect\r\nupon it, and to my impatient friends in California, to whom it has\r\nbeen very hard to say no.\r\n\r\nI am glad to see that you are holding the fight up so hard at the\r\ntail end of the campaign. That is when Democratic campaigns have\r\nso often been lost. Governor Wilson is maintaining himself\r\nsplendidly, and our one danger has been over-confidence. Sincerely\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the political situation he wrote to one of his former\r\nAssistants in the City and County Attorney's office in San\r\nFrancisco\r\n\r\nTo Hugo K. Asher\r\n\r\nWashington, October 22,1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HUGO,--I have your long letter which you promised in your\r\ntelegram. Now, old man, I want to have a perfectly open talk with\r\nyou. I understand your attitude of affectionate ambition for me,\r\nand I am mighty proud of it, that after the years we were\r\nassociated together, the ups and downs we had, you feel the way\r\nyou do.\r\n\r\nWilson is going to be elected unless some miracle happens, and I\r\nwould tremendously like to get out to California and speak to the\r\npeople once more. You do not know just how the old lust for battle\r\nhas come over me. Following your telegram came a letter from\r\nMcCombs, the Chairman of the National Committee, saying that he\r\nhad received a lot of telegrams urging him to have me go and that\r\nGovernor Wilson would like me to. But I wrote him precisely as I\r\nhave you. If the members of this Commission once get into\r\npolitics, the institution is gone to hell, for we can make or\r\nunmake any candidate we wish. This is the most powerful body in\r\nthe United States, and we must act with a full sense of the\r\nresponsibility that is on us ...\r\n\r\nAs for being a member of Wilson's Cabinet, I don't want to be. In\r\nthe first place I can't afford it. There is no Cabinet man here\r\nwho lives on his salary, and as you know, I have got nothing else.\r\nI save nothing now out of the salary that I get, and if the social\r\nobligations of a Cabinet position were placed upon me I would have\r\nto run in debt ...\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I am doing just as big work and as satisfactory work\r\nas any member of the Cabinet. The work that a Cabinet officer\r\nchiefly does is to sign his name to letters or papers that other\r\npeople write. There is very little constructive work done in any\r\nCabinet office. While the glamour of intimate association with the\r\nPresident--the honor that comes from such a position--appeals to\r\nme, for I still have all my old-time vanity and love of dignity\r\nand appreciation; yet the position that I occupy is one of so much\r\npower, and I am conscious so thoroughly of its usefulness, that I\r\ndo not want to change it. I should be more or less close to the\r\nPresident anyway, I presume. His friends are my friends, and I\r\nshall have an opportunity to help make his administration a\r\nsuccess by advising with him, if he desires my advice.\r\n\r\nNow, old man, I have talked to you very frankly, and I know that\r\nyou will understand just what I mean. If I were out of office I\r\nwould have been in Wilson's campaign a year ago. If I wanted a\r\nCabinet position now I would resign from the Commission and go out\r\nto help him. I think probably if I felt that California's vote was\r\nnecessary to Wilson's success and that I could help to get it, I\r\nwould take the latter course, although it is not clear that that\r\nwould be my duty, in view of conditions in the Commission.\r\n\r\nWith warmest regards, believe me, as always, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Francis G. Newlands Reno, Nevada\r\n\r\nWashington, October 28, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SENATOR,--I am delighted at the receipt of your long\r\nletter, for I have been very anxious to know how you felt about\r\nyour own State. Of course it has been a foregone conclusion for\r\nsome time that Wilson would carry the United States, but I was\r\ndesirous that you should carry Nevada for your own sake ...\r\n\r\nIn my judgment the Interstate Trades Commission needs all of your\r\nconcentrated energy for the next year. The bill should be your\r\nbill, and you should be the leading authority upon the matter.\r\n\r\nWilson should look to you for advice along this line of dealing\r\nwith the trust problem. He will, if you have the greater body of\r\ninformation upon the subject. Of course Roosevelt did not know\r\nwhere he was going as to his Trades Commission, and he would not\r\nhave had any opportunity were he elected to go any farther, ...\r\nbecause that Commission has got to feel its way along. Wilson, you\r\ncan see from his speeches, has swallowed Brandeis' theory without\r\nknowing much about the problem, but he certainly has handled\r\nhimself well during the campaign ... What he does will very\r\nlargely depend, I think, upon those who surround him. He must have\r\naccess to sources of information outside of the formal\r\nadministrative officers who make up his Cabinet. This is a very\r\ndelicate way of saying that he must have a sort of \"kitchen\r\ncabinet\" made up of men like you and myself who will be willing to\r\ntalk frankly to him, and whom he will listen to with confidence\r\nand respect. If he can get the Southerners into line with the\r\nNorthern Democrats he can make over the Democratic Party and give\r\nit a long lease of life. If he cannot do this, and his party\r\nsplits, Roosevelt's party will come into possession of the country\r\nin four years, and hold it for a long time ...\r\n\r\nI am glad to see that you have been able to take so personal and\r\ndirect an interest in the campaign. Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing the news of the Democratic victory, in the election of\r\nWoodrow Wilson to the Presidency, Lane sent these letters:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Woodrow Wilson Trenton, N. J.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 6, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GOVERNOR,--The door of opportunity has opened to the\r\nProgressive Democracy. I know that you will enter courageously.\r\nThe struggle of the next four years will be to persuade our timid\r\nbrethren to follow your leadership, \"gentlemen unafraid.\" I am\r\npersuaded from my experience here that no President can be a\r\nsuccess unless he takes the position of a real party leader--the\r\npremier in Parliament as well as a chief executive. The\r\ntheoretical idea of the President's aloofness from Congress--of a\r\nPresident dealing with the National Legislature as if he were an\r\nindependent government dealing with another--is wrong, because it\r\nhas been demonstrated to be ineffective and ruinous. We need\r\ndefiniteness of program and cooperation between both ends of\r\nPennsylvania Avenue. There is generally one end of the Avenue that\r\ndoes not know its own mind, and sometimes it is one, and sometimes\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nYour friends have been made happy through the campaign by the\r\nmanner in which you have conducted yourself. You spoiled so many\r\nbad prophecies.\r\n\r\nWith heartiest of personal congratulations, believe me, faithfully\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo William Jennings Bryan Washington, November 6, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. BRYAN,--The unprecedented heroism of your fight at\r\nBaltimore has borne fruit, and every man who has fought with you\r\nfor the last sixteen years rejoices that this victory is yours.\r\nNow comes the time when it is to be proved whether we are worthy\r\nof confidence. We shall see whether Democrats will follow a wise,\r\naggressive, modern leadership. Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James D. Phelan Washington, November 6, 1912\r\n\r\nDEAR PHELAN,--Hurrah! Hurrah! and again Hurrah! You have done\r\nnobly. The victory in California came late, but it was none the\r\nless surprising and gratifying. We can dance like Miriam, as we\r\nsee the enemies of Israel go down in the flood.\r\n\r\nI shall expect to see you here before long. With warmest\r\ncongratulations to you personally. As always, sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Herbert Harley\r\n\r\nWashington, November 18, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. HARLEY,--... There are many hopeful signs, as you say,\r\nnot the least of which is that the Supreme Court has at last been\r\nmoved to amend its equity rules. The whole agitation for judicial\r\nrecall will do good because it will not lead to judicial recall\r\nbut to the securing of a superior order of men on the bench and to\r\nsimplified procedure. I find that it is better to decide matters\r\npromptly and sometimes wrongly than to have long delays. The\r\npeople have very little confidence in our courts, and this is\r\nbecause of one reason: Our judges are not self-owned; either they\r\nare dominated by a political machine or by associations of an even\r\nworse character. Few men on the bench are corrupt; many of them\r\nare lazy, and others are chosen from the class who feel with\r\nproperty interests exclusively. I am heartily in sympathy with a\r\nmovement such as that you are promoting. It is in my opinion a\r\nvery practical way--perhaps the only practical way--of heading off\r\nuniversal judicial recall. This is a Democracy and the people are\r\ngoing to have men and methods adopted that will give them the kind\r\nof judicial procedure that they want. They are not going to be\r\nunfair unless driven to be radical by intolerable conditions. ...\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImmediately after Woodrow Wilson's election in November, telegrams\r\nand letters from different parts of the country, and especially\r\nfrom his many friends in California, began to reach Lane asking\r\nthat he should consider himself available for a Cabinet position,\r\noffering support and requesting his permission for them to make a\r\nstrong effort in his behalf. This he emphatically refused, saying\r\nthat he was not a candidate, but in spite of his refusals,\r\neditorials began to appear in many Western papers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Charles K. McClatchy Sacramento Bee\r\n\r\nWashington, November 25, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CHARLES,--I received your note and this morning have a\r\ncopy of the paper containing the cartoon on \"Unfinished Business,\"\r\nthe original of which, by the way, I should like to have for my\r\nlibrary. ...\r\n\r\nI know absolutely nothing about the suggestion made by the Call as\r\nto my being appointed to the Cabinet. I rather think that it was\r\nErnest Simpson's friendly act, though I have not heard from him at\r\nall. Three men have been to me from the Coast who wanted to be in\r\nthe Cabinet, and I have told each one the same thing:--That I was\r\nnot a candidate; that no one would speak to the President for me\r\nwith my consent; but that I would not say that I would not accept\r\nan appointment, because I would do almost anything to make\r\nWilson's administration a success, for I believe that he has faced\r\nthe right way and the only difficulty that he will have will be in\r\nsecuring strong enough support to carry out his own policies. I\r\nthink he lacks somewhat in adroitness and that his campaign was\r\nmuch less radical than he would voluntarily have made it. I do not\r\nknow him and shall not go near him unless he sends for me. If he\r\ndoes send for me I shall tell him the truth regarding anybody of\r\nwhom he speaks to me. I shall advocate nobody. I am not going to\r\nbe a job peddler or solicitor. My present position makes all the\r\ndemand upon my imagination, initiative, and capacity that my\r\nabilities justify. I could not work any harder or do any better\r\nwork for the people in any position that the Government has to\r\ngive. I am not at all enamored of the honor of a Cabinet place.\r\n\r\nNow, I am talking to you in the utmost frankness as if you were\r\nsitting just across the table from me. Of course what I am saying\r\nto you is absolutely private and personal. ...\r\n\r\nWe will just let this matter rest \"on the knees of the gods,\" and\r\nI shall try to serve with as little personal ambition moving me as\r\nis possible with a man who has some temperament.\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Ernest S. Simpson San Francisco, Cal.\r\n\r\nWashington, November 26, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SIMPSON,--How it ever entered into your head to give me so\r\nsplendid a boom for a position in Wilson's Cabinet I do not know.\r\nSomeone suggested that the tip came from Ira Bennett at this end,\r\nand I see that the Sacramento Bee suggests that the railroads wish\r\nto remove me from my present sphere of troublesomeness; but my own\r\nguess is that your own good heart and our long-time friendship was\r\nthe sole cause of this most kindly act.\r\n\r\nSome of the California papers, I notice, have had editorials\r\nsaying I should stay where I am (which is not a disagreeable fate\r\nto be condemned to, barring a slight surplus of work), but of\r\ncourse Wilson is not going to appoint anyone to his Cabinet\r\nbecause of pull. He has a more difficult job than any President\r\nhas ever had since Lincoln, because he has to reconcile a\r\nprogressive Northern Democracy with a conservative Southern\r\nDemocracy, and satisfy one with policies and another with offices.\r\nMy guess is that he will have to turn over the whole question of\r\npatronage practically to his Cabinet and that he will become the\r\nactual leader of his party and attempt to formulate the\r\nlegislative policies of the party. He has a distinct ideal of what\r\nthe Presidency may be made. Whether he can make good under\r\nconditions so apparently irreconcilable is a question that time\r\nonly can answer. His political family he will choose for himself.\r\nThey ought to be the very largest men that our country can\r\nproduce, and I am not fool enough to think that I am entitled to\r\nbe in such a group.\r\n\r\nWith the warmest thanks, my dear Simpson, for your kindness,\r\nbelieve me, as always, cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Fairfax Harrison\r\n\r\nWashington, November 26, 191L\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. HARRISON,--That is an exceedingly interesting and\r\nphilosophical presentation of your reason for adherence to the\r\nProgressive Party. I understand your point of view and I\r\nsympathize with it thoroughly. I had the hope that Colonel\r\nRoosevelt would carry several of the Southern states. The\r\nDemocratic party of the North is distinct from the Democratic\r\nparty of the South, at least I fear that it is. The next four\r\nyears will demonstrate the possibility of these two elements\r\nliving together in effective cooperation. If Governor Wilson is a\r\nmere doctrinaire the present victory will be of no value to the\r\nDemocratic party, but may be of great value to the country, for\r\nthe horizontal cleavage in the two parties will become manifest,\r\nunmistakable, and open, and out of the breaking up will come a re-\r\nalignment upon real lines of tendency. If President Wilson\r\nattempts to do anything which satisfies the reasonable demand of\r\nthe progressive North he will run counter to the traditional\r\npolicy of the South; that is to say, effective regulation of child\r\nlabor, of interstate corporations--railroad and industrial--flood\r\nwaters, irrigation projects. [These,] and a multitude of other\r\nmatters make necessary the wiping out of state lines to the extent\r\nthat a national policy shall be supreme over a state policy. As\r\nour good Spanish friend said some centuries ago, \"Where two men\r\nride of a horse one must needs ride behind.\"\r\n\r\nThis fact is stronger than any written word, and facts are the\r\nthings which statesmen deal with. If the South is large enough to\r\nsee this--if it has grown to have national vision--the hope of the\r\nNorthern Democrat can be realized. Otherwise the traditionalists\r\nof both North and South will make a party by themselves, and the\r\nrest of the country will follow in your lead into THE new party or\r\nA new party.\r\n\r\nWith warm regards, believe me, cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James P. Brown\r\n\r\nWashington, November 27, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JIM,--I see your point of view and am glad you have taken\r\nthe position that you have, because you can demonstrate whether\r\nthere is anything excepting a sawed-off shot-gun that will compel\r\nsome editors to tell the truth. ...\r\n\r\nI shall not read your pamphlet because I have too much other\r\nreading that I am compelled to do. My own guess, being totally\r\nignorant on the subject, is that you have violated the Sherman\r\nLaw, but everybody knows that the Sherman Law should be amended\r\nand the conditions stated upon which there may be combination. Do\r\nget out of your head, however, the idea that a railroad\r\ncorporation and an industrial corporation are subject to the same\r\nphilosophy, as to competition. One is necessarily a monopoly and\r\ntherefore must be regulated; the other is not necessarily a\r\nmonopoly, and the least regulation that it can be subjected to the\r\nbetter. We have let things go free for so long that we have\r\ncreated a big problem that sane men must deal with sensibly; not\r\nadmitting all there is to be right, but recognizing every natural\r\nand legitimate economic tendency. With warm regards, believe me,\r\nas always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ADOLPH C. MILLER\r\n\r\nWashington, December 4, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ADOLPH,--Hon. J. J. London, Minister from the Netherlands\r\nto the United States, left last night for San Francisco and will\r\nbe there about the ninth of the month. I have told him somewhat of\r\nyou and I want you to call on him. He is one of the most charming\r\nmen in Washington, really a poet in nature. He loves the beautiful\r\nand good things of the world and is totally unspoiled by success\r\nand position. ...\r\n\r\nIt is very good to know that you and President Wheeler have a sort\r\nof mutual agreement on me for a Cabinet position, but I don't\r\nthink of it for myself. ... I find that I do not have the ambition\r\nthat I once had, excepting to do the work in hand just as well as\r\npossible, and I am altogether impatient with the way I do it. I\r\nshould like to see you Secretary of the Treasury. There is to be\r\nsome change made in our currency laws during the next four years,\r\nand a man of perfectly sane, level mind is tremendously needed to\r\nguide Wilson in this matter, for I guess he is very ignorant upon\r\nthe subject. Especially is this true if Bryan goes into the\r\nCabinet. E. M. House, who is Sid Mezes' brother-in-law, is as\r\nclose to Wilson as any other man, and I will drop him a note,\r\ntelling him something about you, for I know that he is interested\r\nin selecting Cabinet officers as he has been talking to me about\r\npossible Attorney Generals. I have told him that I wanted nothing.\r\n...\r\n\r\nMezes is the same adroit diplomat that he has always been, since\r\nreceiving the Presidency at Texas. He is doing big things for his\r\nUniversity and says that in two or three years he will be in a\r\nposition to retire, and will retire and spend the most of his time\r\nin Europe; but unless my guess is wrong, his ambition has at last\r\nbeen fired and he will look for other worlds to conquer if he\r\nachieves what he is after in Texas. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD M. HOUSE\r\n\r\nWashington, December 13, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. HOUSE,--Another suggestion as to the Attorney\r\nGeneralship. ... Have you ever heard of John H. Wigmore who is now\r\nDean of the Law Department of the Northwestern University? He is\r\none of the most remarkable men in our country. ... He has written\r\nthe greatest law book produced in this country in half a century,\r\nWIGMORE ON EVIDENCE, besides several minor works. There is no\r\nlawyer at the American bar who is not familiar with his name and\r\nhis work. ...\r\n\r\n... Wigmore is a Progressive democrat with a capital P. and a\r\nsmall d; can give reason for his faith based on his philosophy of\r\ngovernment. He has national vision and has rare good common sense.\r\nThe man who can write a good law book is rarely one who would make\r\na good lobbyist, although Judah P. Benjamin was this sort of\r\ngenius. So with Wigmore. He is practical, wise, in the sense that\r\nthis word is used by the boys on the street; knows men and knows\r\nhow to deal with them; never lets theory get the better of\r\njudgment; commands as much respect for his strength as for his\r\nreasonableness; has the enthusiasm of a boy for all good things;\r\nand has infinite capacity for hard work; can say \"No\" without\r\ndeveloping personal bitterness; and is above all a gentleman in\r\nface, manner, and nature. All this I have said with enthusiasm,\r\nbut every word of it is true. I have known him for thirty years.\r\n...\r\n\r\nHe would not thank me for writing this letter, I know. The only\r\nway he could be had to serve would be by persuading him that he is\r\nabsolutely needed. ...\r\n\r\nYou have brought this long letter upon your own head by the\r\ngracious nature of your invitation to me to advise with you. Very\r\ntruly yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER PRESIDENT, UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nWashington, December 23, 1912\r\n\r\nDEAR DR. WHEELER,--What you say regarding the President-to-be is\r\nextremely interesting. That he is headstrong, arbitrary, and\r\npositive, his friends admit. These are real virtues in this day of\r\nslackness and sloppiness. I have just returned from New York where\r\nI have talked with McAdoo and House who are extremely close to\r\nhim, and advising him regarding his Cabinet, and they tell me he\r\nis a most satisfactory man to deal with. He listens quite\r\npatiently and makes up his mind, and then \"stays put.\" His Cabinet\r\nwill be his advisers but no one will control him.\r\n\r\nI heard him make that speech at the Southern Society dinner, which\r\nwas really much larger than the audience could understand. It was\r\na presentation of the theory that the thought of the nation\r\ndetermined its destiny and that we could only have prosperity if\r\nour ideal was one of honor. His warning to Wall Street, that an\r\nartificial panic should not be created, was done in a most\r\nimpressive way. ...\r\n\r\nI was asked to give the names of men from California who would\r\nmake good Cabinet material, and I named Phelan and Adolph Miller.\r\nThe currency question will be the big problem in the next two or\r\nthree years, and I should like Wilson to have the benefit of as\r\nsane a mind as Miller's; but I fancy that even if everything else\r\nwas all right there might be some difficulty in getting a college\r\nprofessor to appoint another college professor.\r\n\r\nI hope we shall see you here soon. With holiday greetings to Mrs.\r\nWheeler and the Boy, believe me, as always, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SIDNEY E. MEZES PRESIDENT, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS\r\n\r\nWashington, December 23, 1912\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SID,--I have your letter enclosing a telegram from Miller.\r\nI received a note from him acknowledging the telegram. He was\r\nevidently extremely delighted at being remembered. The sturdy,\r\nstrong old Dutchman has a whole lot of sentiment in him; and he\r\nmakes few friends, has drawn pretty much to himself, I think, and\r\nfalls back upon those whom he has known in earlier days. I sent a\r\nnote to Mr. House regarding him. He would be a splendid man to\r\nhave here in some capacity connected with the Government, now that\r\nwe are to deal with currency matters. I told Mr. House that he\r\ncould find out all about Miller from you.\r\n\r\nI saw House a couple of times in New York. He certainly is an\r\nadroit and masterful diplomat. The fact is I do not know that I\r\nhave seen a man who is altogether so capable of handling a\r\ndelicate situation. By some look of the eye or appreciative smile\r\nat the right moment he gives you to understand his sympathy with\r\nand full comprehension of what you are saying to him. They tell me\r\nin New York that he is really the man closest to Wilson, and he\r\ntells me that Wilson is a delightful man to deal with because he\r\nhas got a mind that is firm as a rock. ...\r\n\r\nI send my Christmas greetings to you both. We have a sick little\r\ngirl on our hands, but she is coming along all right now. As\r\nalways yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nWashington, January 8,1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--... You may not know it, but I suggested your name\r\nto Mr. House, an intimate of President-elect Wilson, for Attorney\r\nGeneral. ... He told me that he gave the letter to Governor\r\nWilson. ...\r\n\r\nLike so many of the Southerners, I fear that Wilson's idea is that\r\nhe can declare a general policy and be indifferent as to the men\r\nwho carry it out. There is a certain lack of effectiveness running\r\nthrough the South which makes for sloppiness and a lack of\r\nprecision. I have found that generalizations do not get anywhere.\r\nThe strength of any proposition lies in its application. The\r\nrailroads and the trusts and the packers, and all the others who\r\nare violating the statutes, are indifferent as to how big the law\r\nis and upon what sound principles it is based, provided they have\r\na lot of speechmakers to enforce the law. They don't care what the\r\nlaw is; their only concern is as to its enforcement. I am going to\r\ngive the Democratic Party four years of honest trial, and then if\r\nit has not more precision, definiteness, and clearness of aim, am\r\ngoing to call myself a Progressive, or a Republican, or something\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nWilson is strong, capable of keeping his own counsel, and capable\r\nof making up his own mind. In these three respects he differs\r\nmaterially from our present President whose last flop on the\r\narbitration of the Panama Canal proposition is characteristic. ...\r\n\r\nNow, old man, let me say to you that you must take the very best\r\nof care of yourself, for we need you more than anybody else in\r\nthis country, right at this time. As always yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore Washington, January 20, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--I have received both of your letters, and I am very\r\nglad that you made that mistake regarding my address for it\r\nbrought me two letters instead of one. I received your Continental\r\nLegal History months ago and thought that I had acknowledged it\r\nwith all kinds of appreciation, but perhaps I only thought the\r\nthings. ... I turned the book over to Minister Loudon of the\r\nNetherlands who knew the Dutch professor who had written one of\r\nthe articles, and the rascal has not returned the book, but I\r\nshall get it from him one of these days. ... Washington is now\r\ngreatly stirred because Wilson has frowned upon the Inaugural\r\nBall--a very proper frown, to my way of thinking--but inasmuch as\r\nall of the merchants who advance money for the inaugural\r\nceremonies recoup themselves from the receipts from the Inaugural\r\nBall, there is much weeping and wailing and gnashing of teeth, and\r\nWilson will enter Washington, in my judgment, a very unpopular\r\npresident, locally. The fact is, I think, he is apt to prove one\r\nof the most tremendously disliked men in Washington that ever has\r\nbeen here.\r\n\r\nHe has a great disrespect for individuals, and so far as I can\r\ndiscover a very large respect for the mass. His code is a little\r\nnew to us; and I feel justified in proceeding upon the theory that\r\nevery man should help him, and that it is within his (Wilson's)\r\nproper function to throw Mr. Everyman down whenever public good\r\nrequires it, and that his silence never estops him from\r\ninterfering at any time. Perhaps you cannot make out just what\r\nthis means. I am dictating, sitting in my room at home with a very\r\nbad cold, and perhaps I do not know precisely what I mean myself;\r\nbut I am trying to say that under all circumstances Wilson regards\r\nhimself as a free man, and that he is bound by no ties whatever to\r\ndo anything or to follow any course; that he recognizes no such\r\nthing as consistency, or logic, or gratitude, as in the slightest\r\nembarrassing him. ...\r\n\r\nI do hope that the President will get some capable effective\r\nadministration officers who will take the burden of patronage off\r\nhis shoulders and give him a chance to think on the money\r\nquestion, which is his big problem. I like his Chicago speech, I\r\nlike his New York speech, but I do not find many people who\r\nunderstand him, because he is really a sort of philosopher. He\r\nteaches the psychology of new thought, the influence and effect of\r\nthought upon government.\r\n\r\nI have written an article for the World's Work which is to appear\r\nin March, entitled What I Am Trying To Do, but it is really sort\r\nof an answer to one or two articles that they have had upon the\r\nrailroad side of the question of regulation--a demonstration of\r\nthe chaotic condition of things that existed prior to the\r\nestablishment of the Commission; and that the effect of regulation\r\nhas been to increase railroad earnings and put things upon a\r\nstable and more satisfactory basis. ... I find that I have a copy\r\nof the proofs in the office and I am going to send it to you and\r\nask you to criticise it. ...\r\n\r\nWith my love to your good wife, believe me, as always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Joseph N. Teal\r\n\r\nWashington, January 20, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOE,--... You know we practically have the power now to\r\nmake a physical appraisement. ... We should not ourselves attempt\r\nto arrive at cost. That is a very hard thing for the railroads to\r\nfurnish. They have taken good care to destroy most of the books\r\nand papers that would show cost.\r\n\r\nPolitically, I hear of no news. Wilson is able to keep his own\r\ncounsel more perfectly than anybody I have ever known, and nobody\r\ncomes back from Trenton knowing anything more than when he went.\r\n... The money question is going to be the big one, and it looks to\r\nme as though certain gentlemen were preparing to intimidate him\r\nwith a panic, which they won't do because he will appeal to the\r\ncountry. He has got splendid nerve, and while Washington won't\r\nlike him a little, little bit, the country, I think, will put him\r\ndown as a very great President. As always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Edward M. House\r\n\r\nWashington, January 22, 1913\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. HOUSE,--You ask me what is the precise political\r\nsituation on the Pacific Coast as to various candidates for the\r\nCabinet.\r\n\r\nAs I have told you, I am to be eliminated from consideration.\r\nCalifornia has but one candidate, one who was in Governor Wilson's\r\nprimary campaign and who made the fight for him in that state, in\r\nthe person of James D. Phelan whom you have met. ... Recognition\r\ngiven to Phelan will be given to the foremost man in the\r\nprogressive fight in California. ... He is a brilliant speaker and\r\na man of excellent business judgment. ... He has fine social\r\nquality and sufficient money to maintain such a position in proper\r\ndignity. Not to recognize him in some first-class manner would be\r\na triumph for his enemies--and his enemies are the crooks of the\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nJoseph N. Teal who is spoken of from Oregon as a possible\r\nSecretary of the Interior, is a good lawyer and a most public-\r\nspirited man who has been identified with every sane movement for\r\nprogress in that state. He is a man of means and is deeply\r\ninterested in questions of conservation and the improvement of our\r\nwaterways. ...\r\n\r\n ... As a matter of party politics I do not think that any Pacific\r\nCoast state can be made Democratic by the appointment of a member\r\nof the Cabinet from it; as a matter of national politics, it seems\r\nto be necessary that that part of the country should have a voice\r\nin the council of the President.\r\n\r\nNow, I want to say a word or two on a more important matter. You\r\nrealize, I presume (and Governor Wilson evidently does) that there\r\nis talk of a probable panic in the air. He dealt with this matter\r\nmasterfully in his New York speech. Worse things than panic can\r\nbefall a nation. We must preserve our self-respect as a self-\r\ngoverning people. But what is the cause of this loose talk?\r\nApprehension. The business interests of the country do not know\r\nwhat they are to expect. As a party we are too much given to\r\ngeneralization; we have too little precision of thought. You will\r\nnotice how the New York papers of yesterday speak of Governor\r\nWilson's bill regarding the regulation of trusts. This is\r\nsomething definite, and does not frighten because it is known. The\r\nproblems we have to deal with--the tariff, currency, and trusts--\r\nshould all be dealt with in this same manner. The Administration\r\nshould have a definite program on each one of these questions; and\r\nI mean by that, bills framed in conference between the leaders\r\nwhich should be presented as party measures at the very first\r\npossible moment. I have information that the banks are already\r\nsaying that they will stop loans until these questions are dealt\r\nwith. This is the way by which panic can be produced. The country\r\nis too prosperous to allow a widespread industrial panic if the\r\nmeasures favored by the Government commend themselves to the\r\npeople as sane and necessary. Why can't we, as the boys on the\r\nstreet say, \"beat them to it\"? If Congress is called by the middle\r\nof March, and the tariff is quickly put out of the way, and a\r\ncurrency bill promptly follows, we can restore the mind of the\r\ncountry to its normal state by midsummer. You know that this\r\nproblem of government is largely one of psychology. The doctor\r\nmust speak with definiteness and certainty to quiet the patient's\r\nnerves, and the doctor is the party as represented in the\r\nPresident and Congress.\r\n\r\nWith warm regards to Mrs. House, believe me, as always, cordially\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mitchell Innes\r\n\r\nWashington, February 26, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. INNES,--I received your pamphlet and have read it\r\nthrough with the deepest interest. These young men [Footnote: A\r\ngroup of young men organized for social and political betterment,\r\nwho sought advice.] are deserving of the strongest encouragement.\r\nI have no criticism whatever to make of their prospectus--for that\r\nword, I presume, without slight, can be properly used.\r\n\r\nMy conviction is that we can find no solution for the problems of\r\nsocial, political, economic, or spiritual unrest. \"The man's the\r\nman\" philosophy has taken hold of the world. We have lost all\r\ntraditional moorings. We have no religion. We have no philosophy.\r\nOur age is greater than any other that the world has seen. We have\r\nbeen lifted clear off our feet and taken up into a high place\r\nwhere we have been shown the universe. The result has been a\r\ntremendous and exaggerated growth of the ego, and we have regarded\r\nourselves as masters of everything, and subject to nothing.\r\nAgnosticism led to sensualism, and sensualism had its foundation\r\nin hopelessness. We are materialists because we have no faith.\r\nThis thing, however, is being changed. We are coming to recognize\r\nspiritual forces, and I put my hope for the future, not in a\r\nreduction in the high cost of living, nor in any scheme of\r\ngovernment, but in a recognition by the people that after all\r\nthere is a God in the world. Mind you, I have no religion, I\r\nattend no church, and I deal all day long with hard questions of\r\neconomics, so that I am nothing of a preacher; but I know that\r\nthere never will come anything like peace or serenity by a mere\r\nredistribution of wealth, although that redistribution is\r\nnecessary and must come.\r\n\r\nIf I were these young men and wished to concentrate upon some\r\neconomic question, I should put my time in on the cost of\r\ndistribution. ... That is the economic problem of the next\r\ncentury--how to get the goods from the farm to the people with the\r\nlowest possible expenditure of effort; how to get the manufactured\r\nproduct from the factory to the house with the least possible\r\nexpense. I have an idea that we have too many stores, too many\r\nmiddlemen, too much waste motion. So that I have only two thoughts\r\nto suggest: The first is that the ultimate problem is to\r\nsubstitute some adequate philosophy or religion for that which we\r\nhave lost; and the second is to concentrate on the simple economic\r\nproblem. Have we the cheapest system of distribution possible? ...\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR 1913-1915\r\n\r\nAppointment as Secretary of the Interior--Reorganization of the\r\nDepartment--Home Club--Bills on Public Lands\r\n\r\n\r\nHis appointment, as Secretary of the Interior, came to Lane in a\r\nletter from President-elect Wilson, stating that he was being\r\n\"drafted\" by the President for public service in his Cabinet. The\r\nletter was written about the middle of February, 1913. The urgent\r\nmanner of the appointment was caused by Lane's frankly-expressed\r\nreluctance to leave his work on the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission, where opportunity for yet fuller accomplishment had\r\nbeen assured by his recent appointment as Chairman of the\r\nCommission. Seven years of application to the intricate problems\r\nof adjustment between the conflicting claims of the public, the\r\nshippers, and the railroads, did not solve all the issues involved\r\nin new and profoundly interesting cases coming up for\r\nadjudication. In addition to this natural desire to expand and\r\nperfect the technique of administration of his Commission, Lane\r\ndreaded the great increase in social and financial demands\r\ninvolved in a Cabinet position. In addition to these reasons, the\r\nchange in service would mean work with men that he knew only\r\nslightly, if at all, and under a President whom he had never met.\r\nPerhaps the consideration that weighed more heavily than any of\r\nthese, in his feeling of reluctance, was that the portfolio of the\r\nDepartment of the Interior, with its congeries of ill-assorted\r\nbureaus was in itself unattractive to a man with Lane's love of\r\nlogical order. His liking for strong team-work and for the\r\nbuilding of morale among a force of mutually helpful workers\r\nseemed to have no possible promise of gratification among bureau\r\nchiefs as unrelated as those of the General Land Office, the\r\nIndian Office, the Bureau of Pensions, Patent Office, Bureau of\r\nEducation, Geological Survey, Reclamation Service, and Bureau of\r\nMines.\r\n\r\nIt was, therefore, with something of the spirit of a drafted man\r\nthat Lane set his face toward his new work. Members of his\r\nimmediate family recall days of depression after the appointment\r\nfirst came, but the cordial response of the press of the country\r\nto his appointment, the flooding in of many hundreds of letters\r\nand telegrams of congratulation, and President Wilson's own\r\ncordiality--lifted Lane's mood to its normal hopefulness.\r\n\r\nIn relating the history of the appointment itself, Arthur W. Page,\r\nof the World's Work, writes, after talking with E. M. House of the\r\nmatter, \"House recommended Lane, as perhaps the one man available,\r\nadapted to any Cabinet position from Secretary of State down. At\r\none time Lane was slated for the War Department, at another time\r\nanother department and finally placed as Secretary of the Interior\r\nbecause being a good conservationist, as a Western man he could\r\npromote conservation with more tact and less criticism than an\r\nEastern man.\"\r\n\r\nConfronted by a complex and definite task, Lane's mind quickened\r\nto the attack. The situation of the Indian seized his sympathy. In\r\nhis first official report he wrote, \"That the Indian is confused\r\nin mind as to his status and very much at sea as to our ultimate\r\npurpose toward him is not surprising. For a hundred years he has\r\nbeen spun round like a blindfolded child in a game of blindman's\r\nbuff. Treated as an enemy at first, overcome, driven from his\r\nlands, negotiated with most formally as an independent nation,\r\ngiven by treaty a distinct boundary which was never to be changed\r\nwhile water runs and grass grows,' he later found himself pushed\r\nbeyond that boundary line, negotiated with again, and then set\r\ndown upon a reservation, half captive, half protege.\"\r\n\r\nWith this at heart Lane wrote a letter of vigorous appeal to John\r\nH. Wigmore to become his First Assistant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nWashington, March 9,1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--I want you as my First Assistant. It is absolutely\r\nessential that I should have you!! I am aiming to gather around me\r\nthe largest men whom I can secure and to form a cabinet of equals.\r\nFour years of this life here would bring a great deal of\r\nsatisfaction to you. You would meet the distinguished men of the\r\nworld. It is the center of all the great law movements of the\r\nworld,--for peace, international arbitration, reform in procedure,\r\nand such matters. Beside that, we have two or three of the\r\ngreatest problems to meet and solve that have ever been presented\r\nto the American people. First in the public mind is the land\r\nproblem. How can we develop our lands and yet save the interest of\r\nthe Nation in them? Second, and I think perhaps this should be\r\nfirst, is the Indian problem. Here we have thousands of Indians,\r\nas large a population as composes some of the States, owning\r\nhundreds of millions of dollars worth of property which is rapidly\r\nrising in value. I am their guardian. I must see that they are\r\nprotected. They have schools over which we have absolute control--\r\nthe question of teachers that they are to have, the question of\r\nthe kind of education that they are to be given, the question of\r\nindustry that they are to pursue. Their morals, I understand, are\r\nin a frightful state, largely owing to our negligence and the lack\r\nof enforcement of our laws. We can save a great people; and the\r\nFirst Assistant has this matter as his special care. I do not know\r\nof any place in the United States which calls for as much wisdom\r\nand for as great a soul as this particular job. I will give you\r\nmen under you over whom you will have entire control and who will\r\nbe to your liking. I will give you men to sit beside you at the\r\ntable who will be of your own class. You can do more good in four\r\nyears in this place than you can possibly do in forty where you\r\nare now. There are a lot of men who can teach law, and lots of men\r\nwho can write the philosophy of the law, but there are few men who\r\ncan put the spirit of righteousness into the business, social, and\r\neducational affairs of an entire race. Think of that work! Beside\r\nthat you have the constructive work in framing and helping to\r\nframe a line of policy as to the disposition of our national\r\nlands--the opening of Alaska.\r\n\r\nNow, John, I have looked over the entire United States and you are\r\nthe only man that I want. The salary is five thousand a year. You\r\ncan live on that here without embarrassment. The President will be\r\ndelighted to have you, and you will find him treating you with the\r\nsame consideration and giving you the same dignity that he does\r\nall the members of his Cabinet; all the Supreme Court. I have\r\nnever seen a man more considerate, more reasonable. Dr. Houston,\r\nwho has become Secretary of Agriculture, left Washington\r\nUniversity in St. Louis, under an arrangement by which he can\r\nreturn at the end of his term. You, doubtless, could make a\r\nsimilar arrangement, and if you wish to, you will have plenty of\r\nopportunity to give one or two courses of lectures in the\r\nUniversity during the year,\r\n\r\nI have thought seriously of going out to see you, but with Cabinet\r\nconditions as they are it is impossible, for we are passing upon\r\nimportant questions now that prevent that. I am very selfish in\r\nurging you to this, but I am also giving you an opportunity to do\r\nwork that will be more congenial than any you have ever done, and\r\nto be with a more congenial lot of people. If there is any doubt\r\nin your mind let me know, but don't say \"No\" to me. The country\r\nneeds you. You have done a great work. There is nothing higher to\r\nbe done in your line. Now come here and help in a great\r\nconstructive policy. Sincerely and affectionately,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Walter H. Page Worlds Work\r\n\r\nWashington, March 12, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PAGE,--I have just now seen your letter of March 2nd, else\r\nit would have had earlier recognition.\r\n\r\nThe President is the most charming man imaginable to work with.\r\nMost of us in politics have been used to being lied about, but\r\nthere has been a particularly active set of liars engaged in\r\ngiving the country the impression that W. W. was what we call out\r\nWest a \"cold nose.\" He is the most sympathetic, cordial and\r\nconsiderate presiding officer that can be imagined. And he sees so\r\nclearly. He has no fog in his brain.\r\n\r\nAs you perhaps know, I didn't want to go into the Cabinet, but I\r\nam delighted that I was given the opportunity and accepted it,\r\nbecause of the personal relationship; and I think all the Cabinet\r\nfeel the way that I do. If we can't make this thing a success, the\r\nDemocratic Party is absolutely gone, and entirely useless.\r\n\r\nI hope next time you are down here I shall see you. Cordially\r\nyours, FRANKLIN K LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Edwin Alderman President, University of Virginia\r\n\r\nWashington, March 17,1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DR. ALDERMAN,--Your letter of the 14th gives me\r\nexceptional satisfaction, ... because it brings with it extremely\r\ngood news. You say you will win in your fight [Footnote: After a\r\nlong serious illness Dr. Alderman was regaining health.] and that\r\nrejoices me even more than it does to be told of the real\r\nsatisfaction that you get out of my appointment.\r\n\r\nIt was a surprise to me. It came at the last minute. I had to\r\nintroduce myself to the President-elect the day before the\r\ninauguration. I find him consideration itself in Cabinet meetings\r\nand he never seems to be groping. In my mental processes I find\r\nmyself constantly like a man climbing a mountain, pushing through\r\nbelts of fog, but his way seems clear and definite.\r\n\r\nYou certainly would feel at home around the Cabinet table, and all\r\nof us would rejoice to see you there. ... I shall take your note\r\nhome to Mrs. Lane and show it to her with much pride. ...\r\nSincerely yours, FRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Theodore Roosevelt\r\n\r\nWashington, March 24, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COLONEL,--I have received a great many hundred letters,\r\nbut I think I can honestly say that no other one has given me the\r\npleasure that yours has. I am struggling hard to get the reins of\r\nthis six-horse team in my hands and every day I feel more acutely\r\nthe weight of the responsibility that I bear. The last few weeks\r\nhave been put in being interviewed by Senators and Congressmen,\r\nwho wish to name men for the few positions in the office. It has\r\nbeen rather enjoyable, and they have been fair and by no means\r\nperemptory. The hardest place I have to fill is that of\r\nCommissioner of Indian Affairs. How absurd to try to get a man to\r\nhandle the interests of an entire race, owning a thousand million\r\ndollars' worth of property, and have to offer a salary of $5,000 a\r\nyear!\r\n\r\nI hope that you will feel free to give me the benefit of any\r\nadvice as to the conduct of my department that may happen to come\r\nto you out of your great experience. As always, faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO LAWRENCE F. ABBOTT OUTLOOK\r\n\r\nWashington, April 9, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LAWRENCE,--The Japanese are reducing the value of\r\nCalifornia lands by buying a piece in a picked valley, paying any\r\nprice that is demanded. They swarm then over this particular piece\r\nof property until they reduce the value of all the adjacent land.\r\nNo one wishes to be near them; with the result that they buy or\r\nlease the adjoining land, and so they radiate from this center\r\nuntil now they have possession of some of the best valleys. Really\r\nthe influx of the Japanese is quite as dangerous as that of the\r\nChinese. The proposed legislation in California is not to exclude\r\nJapanese alone, but to make it impossible for any alien to own\r\nland, at least until he declares his intention to become a\r\ncitizen. Inasmuch, of course, as Orientals can not become\r\ncitizens, this disbars them from owning land.\r\n\r\nThere is, of course, as in all things Californian, a good deal of\r\nhysteria over this matter, and I think your Progressive friends\r\nare trying to put the Democrats in a bit of a hole by making it\r\nappear that the Democrats are being influenced by the Federal\r\nGovernment to take a more conservative course than the\r\nProgressives desire.\r\n\r\nMy information is that some restrictive legislation will be passed\r\nby the legislature, no matter what Japan's attitude may be, but\r\nJapan's face will be saved and every need met if the legislation\r\nis general in terms. ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril 20, 1913\r\n\r\n... I do not like the sudden turn that Johnson seems to have taken\r\nin the last day or two but I still have faith that those people\r\nout there will do the sensible thing and allow us to save Japan's\r\nface while very properly excluding the Japanese from owning land\r\nin California; and I have no objection whatever to excluding all\r\nthe Englishmen and Scotchmen who flock in there without any\r\nintention of becoming citizens. As always, yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM M. BOLE GREAT FALLS TRIBUNE\r\n\r\nWashington, May 26, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. BOLE,--That is just the kind of a letter that I want\r\nand that is helpful to me. As to the settler, I have one policy--\r\nto make it as easy as possible under the law for the bonafide\r\nsettler to get a home, and to make it just as difficult as\r\npossible for the dummy entryman to get land, which he will sell\r\nout to monopolies. These Western lands are needed for homes for\r\nthe people, not as a basis of speculation.\r\n\r\nAs to the Reclamation Service ... There really was a very bad\r\nshowing made by the Montana projects. It was disheartening to feel\r\nthat we had spent so many million dollars and that the Government\r\nwas looked upon as a bunko sharp who had brought people into\r\nMontana where they were slowly starving to death. The Government\r\nhas returned to Montana almost as much as her public lands have\r\nyielded, whereas in other states, like Oregon and California, less\r\nthan a quarter of the amount they have yielded has been returned\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nEver since I came here Senators and Congressmen have been\r\noverwhelming me with curses upon the Reclamation Service, and I\r\nthought I ought to find out for myself just what the facts were. I\r\ngave every one a chance to tell his story. Now I am being\r\noverwhelmed with protests against the discontinuance of this work.\r\nEvery state is insisting that I shall now start up some new\r\nenterprises or continue some old ones, and I do not know where the\r\nmoney is going to come from. We are bound to be short of funds\r\neven to continue existing work, if we can get no money out of\r\nprojects that are really under way, and there seems to be a\r\nunanimity of opinion among Western Senators and Congressmen that\r\npayment by the settlers must be postponed, because they are having\r\na hard enough time as it now is. I certainly am not going to be a\r\nparty to gold-bricking the poor devil of a farmer who has been\r\ntold by everybody that he is being charged twice as much as he\r\nought to be charged by the Government ... Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Fairfax Harrison\r\n\r\nWashington, June 10, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. HARRISON,--I have not had a minute for a personal\r\nletter in a month. Hence my shabbiness toward you. Condorcet's Vie\r\nde Turgot, I am sorry to say, I have not read. Does he say\r\nanything as to how to make a reclamation project pay, or as to\r\nwhat is the best method of teaching Indians, or how much work a\r\nhomesteader should do on his land before being entitled to patent?\r\nThese are the great and momentous questions that fill my mind.\r\n\r\nI had thought perhaps that as a member of the Cabinet I would have\r\nan opportunity, say once a month or so, to think upon questions of\r\nstatecraft and policy, but I find myself locked in a cocoon--no\r\nwings and no chance for wings to grow.\r\n\r\nAs to my inability to get to you of a Sunday, let me tell you that\r\nthat is the one day when somewhat undisturbed I catch up with the\r\nweek's work. \"Ah, what a weary travel is our act, here, there and\r\nback again to win some prize.\"\r\n\r\nI hope some of these nights to be able to make you acquainted with\r\nsome of my colleagues. They are a charming lot. Every one has a\r\nsense of humor and as little partisanship as possible, and still\r\nbear the title of Democrat. You would enjoy every one of them,\r\nincluding Bryan, who is fundamentally good.\r\n\r\nWith kindest regards, cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Frank Reese\r\n\r\nWashington, July 2, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRANK,--I am delighted to get your letter and to know that\r\nI still stand well with my California friends, especially\r\nyourself, but I am not going to run for United States Senator. Of\r\ncourse, I am not making a virtue of not running, and I certainly\r\nam gratified to know that you at least think that I could be\r\nelected. My work here is just as interesting as any work that a\r\nSenator has. Under this primary system I do not believe there is\r\nany chance for a man who has not got a great deal of money. The\r\ncandidate must devote practically a year of his time to make the\r\nrace, must be able to support his family and himself in the\r\nmeantime. ... Now, when I knew you first I had no money. I have\r\nthe same amount to-day, so that you see there is no possibility of\r\nmy getting into such a fight. Furthermore, we have Phelan as a\r\ncandidate, and it seems to me he ought to be acceptable. There was\r\nalso some talk of Patton getting into the race, and he is a good\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThankfully and cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in July, 1913, Lane started on a tour of investigation of\r\nNational Reclamation projects, Indian reservations and National\r\nParks. With him went Adolph C. Miller, who had become the Director\r\nof the Bureau of National Parks in May. They turned to the\r\nNorthwest, beginning in Minnesota and then proceeding to Montana,\r\nWyoming, and Washington. That he might be thoroughly informed as\r\nto conditions in each place, Lane sent ahead of him an old friend\r\nand trusted employee, William A. Ryan, whose part it was to go\r\nover each project or reservation and find what the causes for\r\ncomplaint were, where poor work had been done, what groups and\r\nindividuals were dissatisfied, and why. In no way was William Ryan\r\nto let it be suspected that he was in any way identified with the\r\nDepartment of the Interior. Traveling in this way, two weeks ahead\r\nof the Secretary, Ryan was able to put a complete report of each\r\nproject in Lane's hands some time before he arrived, so that the\r\nSecretary was thoroughly familiar with all complaints and\r\nconditions before he was met on the train by the representatives\r\nof the Department, who naturally wished to show him only the best\r\nwork. In addition to this, Lane everywhere held public meetings,\r\ninviting all settlers to meet him and make their complaints.\r\n\r\nThis plan enabled him to cover the ground touched by his\r\nDepartment in a comparatively short time. He traveled by night,\r\nwherever possible, and interviewed all those who wished to see him\r\nupon business from seven in the morning until twelve or one at\r\nnight. Sometimes, in a day, he went a hundred and fifty miles in\r\nan automobile, spoke to many groups of farmers in different\r\nplaces, heard their complaints against the Department, and told\r\nthem what the Government was trying to do for them.\r\n\r\nDuring this first tour of inspection Lane reached Portland,\r\nOregon, the latter part of August, and received a telegram from\r\nthe President asking him to go directly to Denver, there to\r\nrepresent the President and address the Conference of Governors,\r\non August 26th.\r\n\r\nLane left the completion of the proposed itinerary of\r\ninvestigation, in Oregon, to Miller and turned back to Colorado.\r\nHe made the opening address at the Governors' Conference and then\r\nrejoined his party in San Francisco, the first of September. Here,\r\nafter several days of conferences and speeches, while standing in\r\nthe sun reviewing the Admission Day parade of the Native Sons, he\r\ncollapsed. This proved to be an attack of the angina pectoris\r\nwhich, several years later, returned with violence. For three\r\nweeks he was ill, but at the end of that time, against the\r\ndoctor's orders, he insisted upon returning to Washington to his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mark Sullivan Collier's Weekly\r\n\r\nWashington, November 6, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SULLIVAN,--I want to thank you for your sympathetic notice\r\nregarding my hard luck out in California, and to let you know that\r\nI am in just as good shape now as I have been for twenty years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: FRANKLIN K. LANE, MRS. LANE, MRS.\r\nMILLER, AND ADOLPH C. MILLER]\r\n\r\nAt the end of your little comment you spoke of conditions in the\r\nlower grades of the Department as being almost as bad as if they\r\nwere corrupt. I have not your article before me, but I think this\r\nis the meat of it. I wish you would tell me just what you mean by\r\nthis. I know that lots of things come to men like you that do not\r\nreach my ears, although I have retained pretty well my old\r\nnewspaper faculty of smoking things out.\r\n\r\nIf we have anything here that is almost rotten, I want to know it\r\nbefore it gets thoroughly rotten. I have found a lot of things\r\nthat were wrong, and have set most of them right. There has\r\nalready been a great improvement; for instance, in Indian\r\naffairs. Under the last Administration, for example, the highest\r\nbid on 200,000 acres of Indian oil lands was one-eighth royalty\r\nand a bonus of one dollar an acre. We recently leased 10,000 of\r\nthese same acres at one-sixth royalty and a bonus of $500,000.\r\n\r\nI have had an examination made into probate matters, in Oklahoma,\r\nand found an appalling condition of things. In one county where\r\nthere are six thousand probate cases pending, all involving the\r\ninterests of Indian minors, the guardians in three thousand cases\r\nwere delinquent in filing reports, and otherwise in complying with\r\nthe law. This week I have arranged with the Five Civilized Tribes\r\nto institute a cooperative method of checking up all of these\r\naccounts and giving them personal consideration; especially\r\nappointing an attorney to look after the interests of these minors\r\nin each of the counties in eastern Oklahoma. We are to aid the\r\nOklahoma courts in cleaning up the State.\r\n\r\nLet me have any facts that will be of help. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTo Edward M. House\r\n\r\nWashington, November 19, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COLONEL,--I had a call last Sunday morning from Mr. Blank\r\nof New York, who came to feel me out on the reorganization of the\r\nDemocratic party in New York City, with particular reference to\r\nthe question of how to treat one William R. Hearst ...\r\n\r\n... [He] has been working for some years, evidently in more or\r\nless close but indirect alliance with Hearst, through Clarence\r\nShearn and a man named O'Reilly, who is Hearst's political\r\nsecretary. In re-creating the Democratic organization in New York,\r\nhe felt it necessary to take Hearst's assistance.\r\n\r\nI was perfectly frank with him, saying that Hearst would be\r\npleased no doubt to reorganize a new Tammany Hall, or any other\r\nDemocratic organization, provided he could run it. He would stand\r\nin with anybody and be as gentle as a queen dove for the purpose\r\nof destroying the existing organization, but that he was a very\r\noverbearing and arbitrary man, with whom no one could work in\r\ncreating a new organization, unless he regarded himself as an\r\nemployee of Hearst. Moreover, I did not see how it was possible to\r\ntake Hearst and his crowd, even on a minority basis, so long as\r\nthey were fighting the Administration, and that I understood\r\nHearst had recently more emphatically than ever read himself out\r\nof the Democratic Party. I told Blank that ... I should not expect\r\nany cooperation between the Federal Government and an organization\r\nin which Hearst was a factor. However, I said that I knew nothing\r\nwhatever as to the feeling of any member of the Cabinet or the\r\nPresident respecting the matter, because I had not discussed the\r\nmatter with them.\r\n\r\n... I am writing this because I want you to know what is going on.\r\nEvidently Blank came over from New York on the midnight train and\r\nhad no other business here except to see me, and perhaps others,\r\non this matter. ... Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen President Wilson took Franklin K. Lane from the Interstate\r\nCommerce Commission to put him in his Cabinet there arose the\r\nquestion of his successor, on the Commission. After consulting\r\nLane, the President appointed in his place, John Marble, also of\r\nCalifornia. A few months after his appointment Mr. Marble died\r\nsuddenly, and Lane lost one of his closest friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James H. Barry San Francisco Star\r\n\r\nWashington, December 1, 1913\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JIM,--I didn't get your telegram until Monday, but I had\r\ntaken care of you in the same way that I took care of myself, in\r\nregard to flowers. I bought three bunches, one for you, one for\r\nMrs. Lane, and one for myself.\r\n\r\nThe most surprising thing, my dear Jim, is the manner in which\r\nMrs. Marble has taken John's death. We took her to our house,\r\nwhere the morning after his death she told me that she had talked\r\nwith him; that he had chided her on breaking down constantly.\r\nSince then, both morning and evening, she says she has seen him\r\nand talked with him. The result is a spirit on her part almost of\r\ngayety, at times. She is really reconciled to his going, because\r\nhe has told her that it was best and that he has other work to do.\r\n\r\nI don't know what to say of all this. It mystifies me. It has\r\ntended greatly to support me against the depth of sorrow which I\r\nfelt at the beginning. There is no evidence of hysteria on her\r\npart, whatever. She dictated to Mrs. Lane, who was sitting beside\r\nher, some of the things that John said to her. It certainly is a\r\nglorious belief, at such a time, and I am not prepared to say that\r\nit is not so, and that its manifestations are not real.\r\n\r\n... It is an impossible thing to get a man to take his place,\r\neither on the Commission or in our hearts. I believe that he\r\nworked himself to death ... Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Edward F. Adams\r\n\r\nWashington, January 10, 1914\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. ADAMS,-- ... Our most difficult problem is that of\r\nwater. Colorado, for instance, claims that all of the water that\r\nfalls within her borders can be used and should be used\r\nexclusively for the development of Colorado lands. Southern\r\nCalifornia has made a protest against my giving rights of way in\r\nthe upper reaches of the Colorado for the diversion of water on to\r\nColorado lands saying that Imperial Valley is entitled to the full\r\nnormal flow of the Colorado. The group of men who hold land in\r\nMexico south of the Imperial Valley make the same claim. Arizona\r\nwishes to have a large part of this water used on her soil, and\r\nthe people of Colorado are divided as to whether the water should\r\nbe carried over on to the eastern side of the Rockies or allowed\r\nto flow down in its natural channel on the western side.\r\n\r\nWe have a similar trouble as to the Rio Grande, which rises in\r\nColorado, where the Coloradans claim all the water can be used and\r\ncan be put to the highest beneficial use. New Mexico, Texas, and\r\nOld Mexico all claim their right to the water for all kinds of\r\npurposes. If we recognize Colorado's full claim there is probably\r\nenough water in Colorado to irrigate all of her soil, but portions\r\nof Wyoming, Nebraska, Arkansas, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, and\r\nUtah would remain desert.\r\n\r\nIf you can tell me how to solve this problem so as to recognize\r\nthe right that you claim Colorado has, and to maintain the rights\r\nthat the Federal Government and the adjoining States have, I shall\r\ncertainly be deeply grateful.\r\n\r\nWith all good wishes for the New Year, believe me as always,\r\naffectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Woodrow Wilson The White House\r\n\r\nWashington, March 11, 1914\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--I have your note of yesterday referring to\r\nme the correspondence between yourself and the Civil Service\r\nCommission on the question of the participation of women Civil\r\nService employees in woman suffrage organizations. I think perhaps\r\nI am a prejudiced partisan in this matter for I believe that the\r\nwomen should have the right to agitate for the suffrage.\r\nFurthermore, I think they are going to get the suffrage, and that\r\nit would be politically unwise for the administration to create\r\nthe impression that it was attempting to block the movement. I\r\nshould think it the part of wisdom for you personally to make the\r\nannouncement that women Civil Service employees will be protected\r\nin the right to join woman suffrage organizations and to\r\nparticipate in woman suffrage parades or meetings. This is\r\npractically what the Civil Service Commission says, but in a more\r\ncareful, lawyer-like manner, whereas whatever is said should be\r\nsaid in a rather robust, forthright style. The real thing that we\r\nare after in making regulations as to political activity is to\r\nkeep those who are in the employ of the Government from using\r\ntheir positions to further their personal ends or to serve some\r\npolitical party. What they may do as individuals outside of the\r\nGovernment offices is none of our business, so long as they do\r\nnothing toward breaking it down as a merit service, do not\r\ndiscredit the service, or render themselves unfit for it ...\r\n\r\nThe spoils system is a combination of gratitude and blackmail. The\r\nmerit system is an attempt to secure efficiency without\r\nrecognizing friendship or fear. We can safely allow the\r\nparticipation of merit system employees in an agitation so long as\r\nthey do not go to the point where official advantage may be had\r\nthrough the agitation by securing a reward through party success\r\n...\r\n\r\nI believe you might well make a statement of two or three hundred\r\nwords in which you could state your decision with the philosophy\r\nthat underlies it, in such a manner as to make the women\r\nunderstand that you are taking a liberal attitude and yet\r\nprotecting the full spirit of the Civil Service idea. Cordially\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn March 1914, for the second time, Lane was invited to the\r\nUniversity of California to receive a degree. This was an honor\r\nfrom his Alma Mater that he greatly desired. The previous year,\r\nthe reorganization of his Department and the pressure of new work,\r\nhad made it impossible for him to leave Washington. But this year\r\nhe had promised to go.\r\n\r\nTo Benjamin Ide Wheeler President, University of California\r\n\r\nWashington, 13 [March, 1914] [The day I was to be with you.]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DOCTOR,--I was prepared to leave last Friday--tickets,\r\nreservations all secured. I had made a mighty effort. My\r\nconservation bills were not all out of Committee but I had\r\narranged to get them out. The House was to caucus and the Senate\r\nto confer, and I had written pleading letters and made my prayers\r\nin person that my bills should be included in the program. On\r\nThursday, the War Department refused the use of an engineer for\r\nthe Alaskan railroad. In one day I drafted and secured the passage\r\nof a joint resolution giving me the man I wanted. The war scare\r\nhad subsided and I had seen the Mediators who said that nothing\r\nwould be doing for two weeks. So I went to the Cabinet meeting\r\nprepared to say goodbye. Then came a bomb--two European powers\r\nserved notice that they would hold us responsible for what was\r\nlikely to happen in Mexico City upon the incoming of Zapata and\r\nVilla, and wanted to know how prepared we were. We left the\r\nCabinet divided as to what should be done. A group of us met in\r\nthe afternoon and decided to ask for another meeting. I carried\r\nthe message. The reply was that the matter must be held over till\r\nthe next meeting, and meanwhile we were asked to suggest a\r\nprogram. Then I sent my message to you. I have told this to no one\r\nbut Anne. You deserve no less than the fullest statement from me.\r\nPlease treat it as the most sacred of secrets. Always gratefully\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter, written about a year after Lane's entry into\r\nthe Cabinet, shows what, in the course of a year, he had been able\r\nto accomplish in building the men of his heterogeneous department\r\ninto a cooperative social unit by means of what he called his\r\n\"Land Cabinet\" and the Home Club.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Albert Shaw Review of Reviews\r\n\r\nWashington, April 8,1914\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. SHAW,--Of course I saw the Review for April before\r\nyour copies arrived, for somebody was good enough to tell me that\r\nthere was a good word in it for me, and no matter how busy I am I\r\nalways manage to read a boost ...\r\n\r\nYou ask what I am doing to bring about team-work in the\r\nDepartment. Many things. As you probably don't know, this has been\r\na rather disjointed Department. It was intended originally that it\r\nshould be called the Home Department, and its Secretary the\r\nSecretary for Home Affairs. How we come to have some of the\r\nbureaus I don't know. Patents and Pensions, for instance, would\r\nnot seem to have a very intimate connection with Indians and\r\nIrrigation. Education and Public Lands, the hot springs of\r\nArkansas, and the asylum for the insane for the District of\r\nColumbia do not appear to have any natural affiliation. The result\r\nhas been that the bureaus have stood up as independent entities,\r\nand I have sought to bring them together, centering in this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things I did was to form what is called a Land\r\nCabinet, made up of the Assistant Secretaries, the Commissioner of\r\nthe Land Office, and the Director of the Geological Survey. We\r\nmeet every Monday afternoon and go over our problems together. The\r\nReclamation Commission is another organization of a similar sort,\r\nand we have constant conferences between the heads of bureaus\r\nwhich have to do with different branches of Indian work, lands,\r\nirrigation, and pensions.\r\n\r\nSome time ago in order to develop greater good feeling between the\r\nheads of the bureaus we organized a noonday mess, at which all the\r\nchiefs of bureaus and most of their assistants take their luncheon\r\n...\r\n\r\nBut the largest work, I think, in the way of promoting the right\r\nkind of spirit within the Department was the organization of the\r\nHome Club. This is a purely social institution, which the members\r\nthemselves maintain. We have now some seventeen hundred members,\r\nall pay the same initiation fee and the same dues, and all meet\r\nupon a common ground in the club. Our club house is one of the\r\nfinest old mansions in this city, formerly the residence of\r\nSchuyler Colfax ... It is a four-story building in LaFayette\r\nSquare, within a half a block of the White House. This house we\r\nhave furnished ourselves in very comfortable shape without the\r\nhelp of a dollar from the outside, and we maintain it upon dues of\r\nfifty cents a month. Each night during the week we have some form\r\nof entertainment in the club--moving pictures, or a lecture, or a\r\ndance, or a musicale.\r\n\r\nI organized this club for the purpose of showing to these people\r\nof moderate salaries what could be done by cooperation. It is\r\nmanaged entirely by the members of the Department. There is no\r\ncaste line or snobbery in the institution, and for the first time\r\nthe people in the different bureaus are becoming acquainted with\r\neach other, and enjoy the opportunities of club life. The idea\r\nshould be extended. We should have in the city of Washington a\r\ngreat service club, covering a block of land, containing fifteen\r\nor twenty thousand members, in which for a trifle per month we\r\ncould get all of the advantages of the finest social and athletic\r\nclub that New York contains. In the Home Club we have a billiard\r\nroom, card rooms, a library, and a suite of rooms especially set\r\naside for the ladies. We are fitting up one of the larger rooms as\r\na gymnasium for the young men and boys, and expect to have bowling\r\nalleys, and possible tennis courts on a near-by lot. In this way I\r\nmeet many of those who work with me, whom I never would see\r\notherwise, and from the amount of work that the Department is\r\ndoing, which is increasing, I am quite satisfied that it has\r\nhelped to make the Department more efficient. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Charles K. Field Sunset Magazine\r\n\r\nWashington, April 18, 1914\r\n\r\nMY BEAR CHARLES,-- ... My picture on the cover of the May Sunset\r\nis altogether the best one I have had taken for some time, and the\r\nDemocratic donkey is encouragingly fat.\r\n\r\nI wish in some way it were possible to impress upon our Western\r\nSenators and Congressmen the advisability of putting through the\r\nbills that I have before Congress in line with my report--a\r\ngeneral leasing bill, under which coal, oil, and phosphate lands\r\ncould be developed by lease, and a water power bill. As it is now,\r\na man runs the risk of going to jail to get a piece of coal land\r\nthat is big enough to work; and the very bad situation in the oil\r\nfield in California is entirely due to the inapplicability of our\r\noil land laws. We have a couple of million acres of good phosphate\r\nlands withdrawn, totally undeveloped because no one can get hold\r\nof them, and no capital will go into our Western power sites\r\nbecause we can give at present only a revocable permit, whereas\r\ncapital wants the certainty of a fixed term.\r\n\r\nI have tried to draft laws, copies of which I inclose, that are\r\nthe best possible under the circumstances. I mean by that, that\r\nthey are reasonable and will be passed by Congress if the West can\r\nonly show a little interest in them, but so far the men who have\r\nbeen fighting them are Westerners. Why? For no better reason than\r\nthat these gentlemen are in favor of having all of the public\r\nlands turned over to the states. It is useless to argue this\r\nquestion as to whether it is right or wrong, because Congress\r\nwould never do it, so that opposition to these bills is simply\r\nopposition to further development of the West.\r\n\r\nNow if you can punch these people up a bit in some way and make\r\nthem understand that the West should want to go ahead, rather than\r\nblock development for all time, ... you will be rendering a public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nWith these few remarks I submit the matter to your prayerful\r\nconsideration. As always, cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Frederic J. Lane\r\n\r\nWashington, April 27, 1914\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRITZ,--I have just received your letter in relation to\r\nStuart. I sent you a letter on Saturday saying that Daniels was\r\ngoing to recommend him. Of course, if he can't pass the physical\r\nexamination that is the end of it, but I would let him try ...\r\n\r\nNed is a great deal like Stuart--smart and lazy, but you know that\r\nall boys can't be expected to come up to the ideal conduct of\r\ntheir fathers at sixteen and eighteen. They go through life a damn\r\nsight more human. I don't see any reason why a fellow should work\r\nif he can get along without it, and the trouble is that your boy\r\nis spoiled by you, and my boy is spoiled by his mother! You have\r\nraised Stuart on the theory that he was a millionaire's son and,\r\nas such, he can't take life very seriously.\r\n\r\nI am figuring now on getting Ned off to some boarding-school where\r\nhe will have more discipline than I can give him. The truth is\r\nthat both of us, having had rather a prosaic Christian bringing\r\nup, have cultivated the idea in our youngsters that it is a good\r\nthing to be a sport, and the aforesaid youngsters are living up to\r\nit. If there was a school in the country where they taught boys\r\nthe different kinds of trees, and the different rocks and flowers,\r\nbirds, and fish, with some good sense, and American history, I\r\nwould like to send Ned to it ... Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Edward E. Leake\r\n\r\nTreasury Department\r\n\r\nSan Francisco, California\r\n\r\nWashington, May 26, 1914.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ED,--I have yours of the 21st. I know that you are\r\nsincere, old man, when you tempt me with the governorship, and you\r\nwrite in such a winning manner that my blood quickens, but really\r\nit is quite out of the question. I want to see California lined up\r\nstrongly on the Democratic side. I also want to see Phelan come to\r\nthe Senate and I am ready to do all that I can to help out the old\r\nState, but my work is cut out for me here and until I have put\r\nover some of the things that I believe will benefit the West as a\r\nwhole, I do not believe I should relinquish the reins of this\r\nparticular portfolio. It is an honor to me, a big one, to be\r\nconsidered by my friends for the governorship and I know that they\r\nwould stand gallantly behind me, and when I send this negative\r\nanswer, you must believe me when I say that I send it with\r\nconsiderable regret.\r\n\r\nI shall be very glad to see you at this end, when you are here,\r\nand you need no excuse to camp on my doorstep.\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo William R. Wheeler\r\n\r\nWashington, June 6, 1914\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BILL,--I am extremely sorry to hear of your being robbed.\r\nThat comes from being wealthy. Poor Lady Alice Isabel! How\r\noutraged and disconsolate she must be! If that diamond tiara I\r\ngave her is gone tell her I will replace it the first time I visit\r\nTiffany's. Of course this only holds good as to the one I gave\r\nher. ... You know, I have often wondered if a burglar should get\r\ninto our house what he would find worth taking away. I have some\r\nsmall burglary insurance on my house, but this was so I could turn\r\nover and sleep without coming down stairs with a shotgun. What\r\nwere you doing, going to Sacramento, anyway? Any fellow who goes\r\nto Sacramento gets into trouble. That is the home of Diggs,\r\nCaminetti, and Hiram Johnson. I see that Johnson is going to be\r\nre-elected Governor, and that the other two are going to jail. I\r\nhope that all three will lead better lives in the future.\r\n\r\nWell, old man, if you need a new suit of clothes or anything in\r\nthe line of underwear, let me know. I have gotten to the point\r\nwhere I have been wearing what Ned does not take, and I will pass\r\nsome of them along to you. ...\r\n\r\nThere is nothing new here. I fear that I shall not get up to\r\nAlaska, as I promised myself, for Congress will be in session for\r\nsome time, and I am striving desperately to get my conservation\r\nbills through. Moreover, just what phase the Mexican situation\r\nwill take cannot be foreseen, from day to day. I was broken-\r\nhearted at not being able to get out to California, but just at\r\nthat particular time--while I was about to go, tickets and\r\neverything purchased--the President called upon me to do something\r\nwhich held me back. The toll bills will probably pass next week,\r\nby a majority of nine. Then the trust bills will come up in the\r\nSenate and every man will have to make a speech. ...\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next letter has been included because it shows Lane's direct\r\nand unequivocal method when defending a subordinate whom he\r\nthought unfairly criticized. He quoted, and in office practised,\r\nRoosevelt's maxim of giving a man his fullest support as long as\r\nhe thought him worthy to be entrusted with public business. The\r\nnames are omitted here for obvious reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo--\r\n\r\nWashington, June 10, 1914\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BILLY,--I have your letter of June 9th, relating to summer\r\nresidence homesteads, and referring sneeringly several times to\r\nBlank. I wonder if you realize that Blank is my appointee and my\r\nfriend. [He] has done you no wrong, and he intends to do the\r\npublic no wrong. He is as public-spirited as you are, but you\r\ndiffer with him as to certain phases of our land policy, though\r\nnot so widely as you yourself think. Is that any reason why you\r\nshould discredit him? Is it not possible for men to differ with\r\nyou on questions of public policy without being crooks? Your talk\r\nhas started Chicago talking; nothing definite, just whispers. Is\r\nthis fair to Blank? Is it fair to me? ... Is the test of a man's\r\npublic usefulness decided by his views as to whether the desert\r\nlands should be leased or homesteaded?\r\n\r\nI am saying this to you in the utmost friendliness, because I\r\nthink that your attitude is not worthy of your own ideal of\r\nyourself, and it certainly does not comport with my ideal of you,\r\nwhich I very much wish to hold. Surely honest men may differ as to\r\nwhether grazing lands should be leased, and if Blank is not honest\r\nthen it is your duty to the public service and to me to show this\r\nfact.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of your letter you say, \"This report will introduce\r\nyou to Mr. Blank.\" Now it just so happens that that line should\r\nread \"This report will introduce you to Mr. Lane,\" for I am\r\nresponsible for that report. It was not written until after he had\r\nconsulted with me, and I dictated an outline of its terms. ... As\r\nalways, cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n To his Brother on his Birthday\r\n\r\nWashington, [August, 1914]\r\n\r\n... This is somewhere around your birthday time, isn't it? Well,\r\nif it is, you are about forty-nine years of age and I look upon\r\nyou as the one real philosopher that I know. I'd trade all that I\r\nhave by way of honors and office for the nobility and serenity of\r\nyour character. You feel that you have not done enough for the\r\nworld. So do we all. But you have done far more than most of us,\r\nfor you have proved your own soul. You have made a soul. You have\r\ntaught some of us what a real man may be in this devilish world of\r\nselfishness. What other man of your acquaintance has the affection\r\nof men who know him for the nobility of his nature? I don't know\r\none. You know many who are lovable, like--sympathetic like myself,\r\nbrilliant, sweet-tempered,--lots of them. But who are the noble\r\nones? Who look at all things asking only, \"What is worthy?\" And\r\ndoing that thing only. You tell the world that you will not\r\nconform to all its littlenesses. That, I haven't at all the\r\ncourage to do. You tell the world that you are not willing to feed\r\nyour vanity with your everlasting soul. Where are the rest of us,\r\njudged by that test?\r\n\r\nAh, my dear boy, you have inspired many a fellow you don't know\r\nanything about, with a desire to emulate you, and always to\r\nemulate something that is genuine and big in you--not a trick of\r\nspeech or a small quality of mind or manner. I envy you--and so do\r\nmany. Nancy could tell you why you are worth while. She knows the\r\ngenuine from the spurious. She knows the metal that rings true\r\nwhen tests come.\r\n\r\nSo there, ... put all this inside of your smooth noddle and take a\r\ndrink to me--a drink of \"cald, cald water.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I just want you to understand that I am in no self-\r\ndeprecatory mood right now, for I am in my office at eight o'clock\r\nof a Saturday evening, working away with all my might on some\r\ndamned land cases, having had a dinner at my desk, consisting of\r\ntwo shredded-wheat biscuits with milk, and one pear. Now you can\r\nrealize what a virtuous, self-appreciative mood I am in. No man\r\ndenies himself dinner for the sake of work without being really\r\nvain.\r\n\r\nAnd what is this I hear about your having neuritis and going to\r\nthe hospital? Damn these nerves, I say! Damn them! I have to\r\nswelter here because I can't let an electric fan play on my face,\r\nnor near me, without getting neuralgia. And swelter is the word,\r\nfor it has been 104-5 degrees, with humidity, to boot, this week.\r\n\r\nNerves--that means a wireless system, keen to perceive, to feel,\r\nto know the things hidden to the mass. I look forward to years of\r\ntorture with the accursed things. The only thing that relieves,\r\nand of course it does not cure, is osteopathy, stimulating the\r\nnerve where it enters the spine. But never let them touch the sore\r\nplace. That is fatal. It raises all the devils and they begin\r\nscraping on the strings at once.\r\n\r\nWell, by the time this reaches you I hope you will be quite a bit\r\nfitter. Avoid strain. Don't lift. Don't carry. If you stretch the\r\ninfernal wires they curl up and squeal.\r\n\r\nMay the God of Things as they Are be good to you. ... Mother may\r\nknow all about us. How I wish I could know that it was so. You\r\nhave the philosophy that says--\"Well, if it is best, she does.\" I\r\nwish I had it. My God, how I do cling to what scraps of faith I\r\nhave and put them together to make a cap for my poor head. With\r\nall the love I have.\r\n\r\nFrank\r\n\r\n To Cordenio Severance\r\n\r\nWashington, September 24,1914\r\n\r\nMy dear Cordy,--I have just received your note. Why don't you come\r\ndown here and spend three or four days resting up? Nancy and Anne\r\nwill be delighted to cart you around in the victoria and show you\r\nall the beautiful trees and a sunset or two, and we will give you\r\nsome home cooking and put you on your feet, and then you will have\r\nan opportunity to beg forgiveness for not having gone up to Essex.\r\nI am mighty sorry that you have been ill. If we had had the\r\nfaintest notion that you were, we would have stayed in New York to\r\nsee you, but as it was we came down on the Albany boat and we went\r\ndirectly from the boat to the train. I think that we would have\r\nstopped over two or three hours and seen you anyway if it had not\r\nbeen for the presence of our dog, who was regarded by the women as\r\nthe most important member of the family.\r\n\r\nDid you ever travel with a dog? We came down through Lake George,\r\nand the Secretary of the Interior sat on a beer box in the prow of\r\nthe steamship, surrounded by automobiles and kerosine oil cans and\r\ncooks and roustabouts, because they would not let a dog go on the\r\nsalon deck. Only my sense of humor saved me from beating my wife\r\nand child, and throwing the dog overboard. On the train some\r\nmember of the family had to stay with the dog and hold his paw\r\nwhile he was in the baggage car. The trouble with you and me is\r\nthat we are not ugly enough to receive such attention. If we had\r\nundershot jaws and projecting teeth and no nose, we probably would\r\nbe regarded with greater tenderness and attention.\r\n\r\nNed is at Phillips-Exeter and is the most homesick kid you ever\r\nheard of. He writes two letters a day and has sent for his Bible,\r\nand tells us he is going to church. If that is no evidence, then I\r\nam no judge of a psychological state.\r\n\r\nCome on down. Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Hon. Woodrow Wilson\r\n\r\nThe White House\r\n\r\nWashington, October 1, 1914\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--Mother Jones called on me yesterday and I had\r\na very interesting and enjoyable chat with her. During our talk\r\nsome reference was made to the sterling qualities of your\r\nSecretary of Labor, for whom she entertains the highest regard.\r\nShe told me this little story about him:--\r\n\r\nOne evening sometime ago, when there was a strike of some workmen\r\nin Secretary Wilson's town, she was in the Secretary's home\r\nwaiting to see him. The Secretary was engaged in another room with\r\nrepresentatives of those opposed to the strikers, and she\r\noverheard their talk. One of the men said, \"Mr. Wilson, you have a\r\nmortgage on this house, I believe.\"\r\n\r\nThe reply was in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the speaker, \"if you will see that this strike is\r\ncalled away from our neighborhood--we don't ask you to terminate\r\nit, but merely to see that the strikers leave our town--if you\r\nwill do this, we will take pleasure in presenting you with a large\r\npurse and also in wiping off the mortgage on your home.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson arose, his voice trembling and his arm lifted, and\r\nsaid, \"You gentlemen are in my house. If you come as friends and\r\nas gentlemen, all of the hospitalities that this home has to offer\r\nare yours. But if you come here to bribe me to break faith with my\r\npeople, who trust me and whom I represent, there is the door, and\r\nI wish you to leave immediately.\"\r\n\r\nMother Jones concluded by saying, \"Mr. Wilson never tells this\r\nstory, but I heard it with my own ears, and I know what a real man\r\nhe is.\"\r\n\r\nI wish that you could have heard the story yourself. I am telling\r\nit to you now, for I know how pleased you will be to hear of it,\r\neven in this indirect way. Faithfully yours, FRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 30, 1914 Colonel Roosevelt wrote to Lane saying,--\r\n\r\n\"That's a mighty fine poem on Uncle Sam's Thanksgiving! I wish you\r\nwould give me a chance to see you sometime.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know Mr. Garrison and perhaps he would resent my saying\r\nthat I think he has managed his Department excellently; but if you\r\nthink he would not resent it, pray tell him so. I hear nothing but\r\ngood of you--but if I did hear anything else I should not pay any\r\nheed to it. ...\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Theodore Roosevelt\r\n\r\nWashington, December 3, 1914\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COLONEL,--I have just received your note of November 30th,\r\nand I am very much gratified at your reference to my Thanksgiving\r\nlines. You may be interested in knowing that the Home Club, before\r\nwhich I read these lines, is an institution that I organized since\r\nbecoming Secretary, for the officers and employees of my\r\nDepartment. ...\r\n\r\nYou may rest assured that I shall convey your message to Mr.\r\nGarrison, and I know that he will be just as pleased to receive it\r\nas I am in being able to carry it.\r\n\r\n... The work of the Department keeps me pretty closely to my desk,\r\nso that I have few opportunities of getting away from Washington.\r\nI certainly shall not let a chance of seeing you go by without\r\ntaking advantage of it.\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Hon. Woodrow Wilson\r\n\r\nThe White House\r\n\r\nWashington, January 9, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--That was a bully speech, a corker! You may\r\nhave made a better speech in your life but I never have heard of\r\nit. Other Presidents may have made better speeches, but I have\r\nnever heard of them. It was simply great because it was the proper\r\nblend of philosophy and practicality. It had punch in every\r\nparagraph. The country will respond to it splendidly. It was\r\njubilant, did not contain a single minor note of apology and the\r\ncountry will visualize you at the head of the column. You know\r\nthis country, and every country, wants a man to lead it of whom it\r\nis proud, not because of his talent but because of his\r\npersonality,--that which is as indefinable as charm in a woman,\r\nand I want to see your personality known to the American people,\r\njust as well as we know it who sit around the Cabinet table. Your\r\nspeech glows with it, and that is why it gives me such joy that I\r\ncan't help writing you as enthusiastically as I do. Sincerely\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Lawrence F. Abbott\r\n\r\nOutlook\r\n\r\nWashington, January 12, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. ABBOTT,--I enclose you two statements made with\r\nreference to our public lands water power bill and our western\r\ndevelopment bill. The power trust is fighting the power bill,\r\nalthough as amended by the Senate Committee it is especially\r\nliberal and fair and will bring millions of dollars into the West\r\nfor development of water power. There seems to be no real\r\nopposition to the western development bill, generally called the\r\nleasing bill, excepting from those who believe that all of our\r\npublic lands should be turned over to the States.\r\n\r\nThese are non-partisan measures. They have been drafted in\r\nConsultation with Republicans and Progressives, as well as\r\nDemocrats, and I regard them as the ultimate word of generosity on\r\nthe part of the Federal Government, because all of the money\r\nproduced is to go into western development. If these bills are\r\nkilled, I fear that the West will never get another opportunity to\r\nhave its withdrawn lands thrown open for development upon terms as\r\nsatisfactory to it.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand why men who already have great power\r\nplants on public land should be opposing such a bill as our power\r\nbill, and equally easy to understand why the coal monopolists\r\nshould be fighting off all opportunity for any competitor to get\r\ninto the field. The oil men are anxious for such legislation. Of\r\ncourse this legislation is not ideal, because it is the result of\r\ncompromise between minds, as to methods. The power bill is vitally\r\nright in one thing; that the rights granted revert at the end of\r\nfifty years to the Government, if the Government wishes to take\r\nthe plant over. The development bill is right, because it sets\r\naside a group of archaic laws under which monopoly and litigation\r\nand illegal practices have thrived. Both of these bills have\r\npassed the House, and are before the Senate. I trust that the\r\nfixed determination of those who are hostile to them will not\r\nprevail.\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n This letter, duplicated, was sent to several editors of\r\nmagazines, to inform the public as to pending legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN WAR AND PERSONAL CONCERNS\r\n\r\n1914-1915\r\n\r\nEndorsement of Hoover--German Audacity--LL.D. from Alma Mater\r\n--England's Sea Policy--Christmas letters\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN\r\n\r\nWashington, November 17, 1914\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. SECRETARY,--If it is true that the State Department is\r\nnot informed regarding Mr. Hoover and his entire responsibility, I\r\ncan send to you to-day his attorney, Judge Curtis H. Lindley, of\r\nSan Francisco, who stands at the head of our bar.\r\n\r\nI know of Mr. Hoover very well. He is probably the greatest mining\r\nengineer that the world holds to-day, and is yet a very young man.\r\nHe is a graduate of Stanford University.\r\n\r\nI suppose that you do not wish to make any statement regarding Mr.\r\nHoover, but I should fancy that there is no objection to Mr.\r\nFletcher making any statement that he desires. There are hundreds\r\nof thousands of people in the United States to-day who are anxious\r\nto know how the things that they are preparing for the different\r\nEuropean countries, especially for the Belgians, can be sent to\r\nthem. Some information along this line might be very helpful.\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS\r\n\r\nROME, ITALY\r\n\r\nWashington, January 22, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--I have often thought of you during these last few\r\nmonths, and wished for a good long talk so some of the kinks in my\r\nown brain might be straightened out. It looks to me very much as\r\nif the war were a stalemate. Even if England throws another\r\nmillion men into the field in May I can't see how she can get\r\nthrough Belgium and over the Rhine. Germany is practically self-\r\nsupported, excepting for gasoline and copper, and no doubt a\r\nconsiderable amount of these are being smuggled in, one way or\r\nanother. The Christians are having a hard time reconciling\r\nthemselves to existing conditions. ... England is making a fool of\r\nherself by antagonizing American opinion, insisting upon rights of\r\nsearch which she never has acknowledged as to herself. If she\r\npersists she will be successful in driving from her the opinion of\r\nthis country, which is ninety per cent in her favor, although\r\npractically all of the German-Americans are loyal to their home\r\ncountry. We have some ambition to have a shipping of our own, and\r\nEngland's claim to own the seas, as Germany puts it, does not\r\nstrike the American mind favorably. No doubt this will be regarded\r\nby you as quite an absurdity, that we should have any such dream,\r\nbut I find myself from day to day feeling a twinge or two of\r\nbitterness over England's stubbornness, which seems to be as\r\nirremovable a quality as it was in some past days. ...\r\n\r\nYour little Nancy is no longer little. She is up to my ear, has\r\ngone out to several evening parties, is at last going to school\r\nlike other girls, keeps up her violin, and is very much of a\r\njoy. ...\r\n\r\nI knew that you would like our Ambassador. Cultivate him every\r\nchance you get.\r\n\r\nAffectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nOn February 20, 1915, Lane went to San Francisco and formally\r\nopened the Panama Pacific Exposition, as the personal\r\nrepresentative of the President. He spoke on \"That slender,\r\ndauntless, plodding, modest figure, the American pioneer, ...\r\nwhose long journey ... beside the oxen is at an end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALEXANDER VOGELSANG\r\n\r\nEn route, near Ogden, Utah, February 22, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ALECK.--You are the best of good fellows, and I don't see\r\nany reason why I should not tell you so, and of my affection for\r\nyou. Don't mind the slaps and raps that you get, regarding the\r\nhigh duty you perform. The people respect you as an entirely\r\nhonest and efficient public servant. It did my heart good to hear\r\nthe men I talked with speak so appreciatively of you. I enjoyed my\r\ntwo days with you as I have not enjoyed any two days for many\r\nyears. The best thing in all this blooming world is the friendship\r\nthat one fellow has for another. I would truly love to have the\r\nPresident know our Amaurot crowd, but I can't quite plan out a way\r\nby which it could be done. ... As always, affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. WIGMORE\r\n\r\nEn route to Chicago, February 25, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--I have read your preface with great satisfaction.\r\nIt will, no doubt, renew your self-confidence to know that it has\r\nmy approval. You make some profound suggestions which would never\r\nin the world have occurred to me. The American believes that the\r\ndoctrine of equality necessarily implies unlimited appeal. This is\r\nmy psychological explanation for the unwillingness to give our\r\njudges more power. Another explanation is that the American people\r\nare governed by sets of words, one formula being that this is a\r\ngovernment by law, hence the judge must have no discretion and\r\nrules must be arbitrary and fixed.\r\n\r\nI had a roaring good time in San Francisco. Spoke to fifty\r\nthousand people, and more, who could not hear me. Made a rotten\r\nspeech and met those I loved best, so I am not altogether\r\ndispleased with having taken the trip after all.\r\n\r\nHope your arm is doing finely. Give my love to your dear wife.\r\nAffectionately yours,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS\r\n\r\nROME, ITALY\r\n\r\nWashington, March 3, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--All things are so large these days that I can not\r\ncompress them within the confines of a letter. I mean, don't you\r\nknow, that there is no small talk. We are dealing with life and\r\ndeath propositions, life or death to somebody all the time.\r\n\r\nI suppose if you were a few years younger you would be over in the\r\ntrenches, or up in England getting ready. From all we hear, the\r\nScotchmen are the only fellows that the Germans really are afraid\r\nof or entirely respect. The position of a neutral is a hard one.\r\nWe are being generously damned by the Germans and the aggressive\r\nIrish for being pro-British, and the English press people and\r\nsympathizers in this country are generously damning us as the\r\ngrossest of commercialists who are willing to sell them into the\r\neternal slavery of Germany for the sake of selling a few bushels\r\nof wheat. Neither side being pleased, the inference is reasonable\r\nthat we are being loyal to our central position. ...\r\n\r\nI went out recently and opened the San Francisco Fair, parading at\r\nthe head of a procession of a hundred thousand people. The Fair is\r\ntruly most exquisitely beautiful. There are many buildings that\r\nwould even, no doubt, please your most fastidious eye.\r\n\r\nWe have tried to get a Shipping Bill through which would allow us\r\nto get into South American and other trade, but the Republicans\r\nhave blocked us, not because they feared we would get mixed up\r\nwith the war but because they don't want us to do a thing that\r\nwould further Government ownership of anything.\r\n\r\nThe Administration is weak, east of the Alleghanies; and strong,\r\nwest of the Alleghanies. Bryan is a very much larger man and more\r\ncompetent than the papers credit him with being. The President is\r\ngrowing daily in the admiration of the people. He has little of\r\nthe quality that develops affection, but this, I think, comes from\r\nhis long life of isolation.\r\n\r\nWe regard ourselves as very lucky in the men we have in the\r\nforeign posts, notwithstanding the attacks made upon us by your\r\npress. ...\r\n\r\nI wish you would convey my hearty respects to His Excellency, the\r\nAmbassador, and to your wife, of whose return to health I am\r\ndelighted to hear. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD J. WHEELER\r\n\r\nCURRENT OPINION\r\n\r\nWashington, March 4, 1915\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. WHEELER,--I am extremely obliged to you for your\r\nappreciative letter regarding my speech, [Footnote: On the\r\nAmerican Pioneer.] but don't publish it in the Poetry Department\r\nor you will absolutely ruin my reputation as a hard working\r\nofficial. No man in American politics can survive the reputation\r\nof being a poet. It is as bad as having a fine tenor voice, or\r\nknowing the difference between a Murillo and a Turner. The only\r\nreason I am forgiven for being occasionally flowery of speech is\r\nthat I have been put down as having been one of those literary\r\nfellows in the past. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS\r\n\r\nROME, ITALY\r\n\r\nWashington, March 13, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--I have received three letters from you within the\r\nlast two weeks, greatly to my joy. Your first and longest letter,\r\nbut not a word too long, I thought so very good that I had it\r\nduplicated on the typewriter and sent a copy to each member of the\r\nCabinet, excepting Bryan, whom you refer to in not too\r\ncomplimentary a manner. On the same day that I received this\r\nletter I received one from Pfeiffer, presenting the American\r\nmerchants' point of view, who desire to get goods from Germany, a\r\ncopy of which I inclose. So I put your letter and his together,\r\nand told them all who you both are. Thus, old man, you have become\r\na factor in the determination of international policy. Several\r\nmembers of the Cabinet have spoken with the warmest admiration of\r\nyour letter, one scurrilous individual remarking that he was\r\nastonished to learn that I had such a learned literary gent as an\r\nintimate friend.\r\n\r\nWe are just at present amused over the coming into port of the\r\nGerman converted cruiser Eitel, with the captain and the crew of\r\nthe American bark, William P. Frye, on board. The calm gall of the\r\nthing really appeals to the American sense of humor. Here is a\r\nGerman captain, who captured a becalmed sailing ship, loaded with\r\nwheat, and blows her up; sails through fifteen thousand miles of\r\nsea, in danger every day of being sunk by an English cruiser, and\r\nthen calmly comes in to an American port for coal and repairs. The\r\ncheek of the thing is so monumental as to fairly captivate the\r\nAmerican mind. What we shall do with him, of course, is a very\r\nconsiderable question. He can not be treated as a pirate, I\r\nsuppose, because there can not be such a thing as a pirate ship\r\ncommanded by an officer of a foreign navy and flying a foreign\r\nflag. But he plainly pursued the policy of a pirate, and I am\r\nexpecting any day to find Germany apologizing and offering amends.\r\nBut there may be some audacious logic by which Germany can justify\r\nsuch conduct. Talking of Belgium, I was referred the other day to\r\nthe report of the debates in the House of Commons found in the\r\n10th volume of Cobbett's Parliamentary Reports, touching the\r\nattack on Copenhagen by England in 1808, in which the Ministry\r\njustified its ruthless attack upon a neutral power in almost\r\nprecisely the same language that Von Bethmann Hollweg used in\r\njustifying the attack on Belgium, and Lord Ponsonby used the sort\r\nof reasoning then, in answer to the Government, that England is\r\nnow using in answer to Germany. I was distrustful of the\r\nquotations that were given to me and looked the volume up, and\r\nfound that England was governed by much the same idea that Germany\r\nwas--just sheer necessity. Of course, your answer is that we have\r\ntraveled a long way since 1808.\r\n\r\nDoesn't it look to you an impossible task for England and France\r\nto get beyond the Rhine, or even get there? England, of course,\r\nhas hardly tried her hand in the game yet and if the Turk is\r\ncleaned up she will have a lot of Australians and others to help\r\nout in Belgium. Sir George Paish told me they expect to have a\r\nmillion and a half men in the field by the end of this summer.\r\n\r\nPfeiffer comes here to-day to spend a couple of days trying to do\r\nsomething for the State Department; I don't know just what, but I\r\nshall be mighty glad to see the old chap. I haven't seen anything\r\nof Lamb since his return.\r\n\r\nDo write me again. Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nOn the sixteenth of March Lane again started for San Francisco,\r\ncrossing the continent for the third time within a month. Vice-\r\nPresident Marshall, Adolph C. Miller, now of the Federal Reserve\r\nBoard, and Franklin D. Roosevelt, assistant Secretary of the Navy,\r\nwho were going out to visit officially the Exposition, were the\r\nprincipal members of the party. In Berkeley, on March twenty-\r\nthird, 1915, Lane received his degree from the University of\r\nCalifornia. In conferring this degree President Wheeler said:--\r\n\r\n\"Franklin K. Lane,--Your Alma Mater gladly writes to-day your name\r\nupon her list of honour,--in recognition not so much of your\r\nbrilliant and unsparing service to state and nation, as of your\r\nsympathetic insight into the institutions of popular government as\r\nthe people intended them. An instinctive faith in the righteous\r\nintentions of the average man has endowed you with a singular\r\npower to discern the best intent of the public will. Men follow\r\ngladly in your lead, and are not deceived.\r\n\r\n\"By direction of the Regents of the University of California I\r\nconfer upon you the degree of Doctor of Laws:--\r\n\r\n\"Creative statesman in a democracy; big-hearted American.\" On\r\nDecember 7, 1915, upon receiving a copy of the diploma Lane wrote\r\nin acknowledgement to Dr. Wheeler,--\"I have the diploma which it\r\nhas taken all the talent of the office to translate. I had one man\r\nfrom Columbia, another from the University of Virginia, one from\r\nNebraska, and one at large at work on it. Thank you. It takes the\r\nplace of honor over my mantel.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM P. LAWLOR\r\n\r\nJUSTICE, SUPREME COURT OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nWashington, April 13, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JUDGE,--I have read Eddy O'Day's poem with great delight.\r\nAlong toward the end it carries a sentiment that our dear old\r\nfriend John Boyle O'Reilly expressed in his poem Bohemia, in which\r\nhe speaks of those,\r\n\r\n\"Who deal out a charity, scrimped and iced, In the name of a\r\ncautious, statistical Christ.\"\r\n\r\nI have never been able to write a line of verse myself, although I\r\nhave tried once in a while, but long ago my incapacity was proved.\r\nPegasus always bucks me off.\r\n\r\nI am sorry you took so seriously what I had to say of the wedding\r\ninvitation, but you know I am one of those very sentimental chaps,\r\nwho loves his friends with a great devotion, and when anything\r\ngood comes to them I want to know of it first, and no better\r\nfortune can come to any man than to marry a devoted, high-minded\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nYour rise has been a joy to me, because neither you nor I came to\r\nthe bar nor to our positions by conventional methods. The union\r\nspirit is very strong among lawyers, and if a man has ideas\r\noutside of law, or wishes to humanize the law, he is regarded with\r\nsuspicion by his fellows at the bar. You have proved yourself and\r\narrived against great odds. No man that I know has ever had such a\r\ntestimonial of public confidence as you received in the last\r\nelection. I hope that with the hard work much joy will come to\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lane has just dropped in and wishes me to send you her warm\r\nregards. Always sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM G. MCADOO\r\n\r\nSECRETARY OF THE TREASURY\r\n\r\nWashington, April 27, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MAC,--Here is a man for us to get next to. He is a\r\nHarriman, a Morgan, a Huntington, a Hill, a Bismarck, a Kuhn Loeb,\r\nand a damn Yankee all rolled into one! Can you beat it? His\r\ndaughter also looks like a peach. I do not know the purpose of\r\nthis financial congress in which these geniuses from the hot belt\r\nare to gather; but unless I am mistaken you are looking around for\r\nsome convenient retreat to go to when this Riggs litigation is\r\nover and you are turned out scalpless upon a cruel world. Here is\r\nyour chance! Tie up with Pearson. He has banks, railroads, cows,\r\nhorses, mules, land, girls, alfalfa, clubs, and is connected with\r\nevery distinguished family in North and South America.\r\n\r\nThis man, Dr. Hoover, is a genius. When I knew him he was giving\r\nlessons in physical training; but, now, like myself, he is an\r\nLL.D., and, of course, as a fellow LL.D. I have got to treat his\r\nfriend properly. So I pass him along to you. Please see that he\r\nhas the front bench and is called upon to open the congress with\r\nprayer, which, being a Yankee and a pirate, he undoubtedly can do\r\nin fine fashion.\r\n\r\nWhen he comes, if you will let me know, I shall go out to meet him\r\nin my private yacht; take him for a drive in my tally-ho; give him\r\na dinner at Childs', and take him to the movies at the Home Club.\r\n\r\nI shall also ask Redfield to invite him to the much-heralded shad\r\nluncheon, to which I have received the fourth invitation. Do you\r\nthink he would like to meet my friend, Jess Willard?\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n A letter from John Burns, from Rome, spoke sarcastically of the\r\nAmerican attitude of neutrality toward the European war, and of\r\nwhat he called the \"new American motto--'Trust the President.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS\r\n\r\nROME, ITALY\r\n\r\nWashington, May 29, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--I saw Pfeiffer, Lamb, and Mezes the other day up in\r\nNew York. Mezes lives among Hebrews, Lamb is broken-hearted that\r\nhe can not get into the war, and Pfeiffer is trying to get England\r\nto let his German goods through Holland. Lamb and Pfeiffer do not\r\nagree as to England's duty to allow non-contraband on neutral\r\nships to pass unmolested.\r\n\r\nEngland is playing a rather high game, violating international law\r\nevery day. ... England's attempt to starve Germany has been a\r\nfizzle. Germany will be better off this summer than she was two\r\nyears ago, have more food on hand. There are no more men in\r\nGermany outside of the Army. Practically every one has been called\r\nout who could carry a gun, but the women are running the mills and\r\nthe prisoners are tilling the farms. Von Hindenburg will come down\r\nupon Italy, when he has lured the Italians up into some pass and\r\ngiven them a sample of what the Russians got in East Prussia.\r\n\r\nYou see I am in quite a prophetic mood this afternoon.\r\n\r\nTell me if you understand Italy's position--just how she justifies\r\nherself in entering the war? I have seen no authoritative\r\njustification that I thought would hold water.\r\n\r\nThe Coalition ministry in England is weaker than the Liberal\r\nministry. Lord Northcliffe, who is the Hearst of England, has\r\nbecome its boss. Inasmuch as you object to our new motto, \"Trust\r\nthe President,\" I offer as a substitute, \"Trust Lord Northcliffe,\r\nBonar Law, and the Philosopher of Negation.\" The dear bishops\r\nwon't give up their toddy, so England must go without ammunition.\r\nGermany is standing off Belgium, England and France, with her\r\nright hand; Russia with her left, and is about to step on Italy.\r\nGermany has not yet answered our protest in the Lusitania matter.\r\nNeither has England answered our protest, sent some three months\r\nago, against the invasion of our rights upon the seas. I was very\r\nglad to read the other day that while only eighty per cent of\r\nEnglish-made shells explode, over ninety per cent of American-made\r\nshells explode.\r\n\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. W. SCRIPPS\r\n\r\nSCRIPPS MCRAE SYNDICATE\r\n\r\nWashington, June 1, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. SCRIPPS,--I am extremely glad to get your letter--and\r\nsuch a hearty, noble-spirited letter. It came this morning, and\r\nwas so extraordinary in its patriotic spirit that I took it to the\r\nWhite House and left it with the President.\r\n\r\nI am sure that great good will come of the effort you are making\r\nto gather the people in support of the President. The poor man has\r\nbeen so worried by the great responsibilities put upon him that he\r\nhas not had time to think or deal with matters of internal\r\nconcern. ... He is extremely appreciative of the spirit you have\r\nshown. I have a large number of matters in my own Department--\r\nAlaskan railroad affairs and proposed legislation--that I ought to\r\ntake up with him; but I can not worry him with them while\r\ninternational concerns are so pressing.\r\n\r\nI feel that at last the country has come to a consciousness of the\r\nPresident's magnitude. They see him as we do who are in close\r\ntouch with him. ... My own ability to help him is very limited,\r\nfor he is one of those men made by nature to tread the wine-press\r\nalone. The opportunity comes now and then to give a suggestion or\r\nto utter a word of warning, but on the whole I feel that he\r\nprobably is less dependent upon others than any President of our\r\ntime. He is conscious of public sentiment--surprisingly so--for a\r\nman who sees comparatively few people, and yet he never takes\r\npublic sentiment as offering a solution for a difficulty; if he\r\ncan think the thing through and arrive at the point where public\r\nsentiment supports him, so much the better. He will loom very\r\nlarge in the historian's mind two or three decades from now.\r\n\r\nIn the fall I am going to ask you to lend a hand in support of my\r\nconservation bills, which look like piffling affairs now in\r\ncontrast with the big events of the day.\r\n\r\nOnce more I thank you heartily for your letter. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. WICKERSHAM\r\n\r\nWashington, July 18, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AND DISTINGUISHED SIR,--I once knew a vainglorious chap\r\nwho wrote a poem on the Crucifixion of Christ. The refrain was,--\r\n\r\n\"Had I been there with three score men, Christ Jesus had not\r\ndied.\"\r\n\r\nAll of us feel \"that-a-way\" once in a while when we think of\r\nGermany, Mexico, and such. I shall have a few words to say upon\r\nthe German note next Tuesday. [Footnote: Day of Cabinet meeting.]\r\nThey will be short and somewhat ugly Anglo-Saxon words, utterly\r\nundiplomatic, and I hope that some of them will be used.\r\n\r\nThere is no man who has a greater capacity for indignation than\r\nthe gentleman who has to write that note, and no man who has a\r\nsincerer feeling of dignity, and no man who dislikes more to have\r\na damned army officer, filled with struttitudinousness, spit upon\r\nthe American Flag--a damned goose-stepping army officer!\r\n\r\nThis morning comes word that they tried to torpedo the Orduna, but\r\nfailed by a hair. This does not look like a reversal of policy. Of\r\ncourse those chaps think we are bluffing because we have been too\r\npolite. We have talked Princetonian English to a water-front\r\nbully. I did not believe for one moment that our friends, the\r\nGermans, were so unable to see any other standpoint than their\r\nown.\r\n\r\nI saw ex-secretary Nagel here the other day. We were at the same\r\ntable for lunch at the Cosmos Club. One of the men at the table\r\nsaid, \"I think Lane ought to have been appointed Secretary of\r\nState.\" Nagel's usual diplomacy deserted him, and with a face\r\nevidencing a heated mind replied, \"Oh, my God, that would never\r\ndo, never do; born in Canada.\" So you see I am cut out from all\r\nthese great honors. Is this visiting the sins of the fathers upon\r\nthe children?\r\n\r\nI wish you joy in your work and I wish I could lay some of my\r\ntroubles on your shoulders. Mrs. Lane and I are going up to see\r\nyou just as soon as we get the chance. I had to decline to address\r\nthe American Bar Association because I did not want to be away\r\nfrom here for a week. This is Sunday, and I am trying to catch up\r\nsome of my personal mail which has been neglected for six weeks.\r\nThus you may know that I am in the Government Service.\r\n\r\nI send you by this mail a copy of my speech in San Francisco,\r\nwhich has been gotten up to suit the artistic taste of my private\r\nsecretary. As always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n TO FREDERIC J. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, July 21, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRITZ,--I wish I could think of something I could do for\r\nyou dear people back there. I haven't heard from George for a long\r\nwhile, but I hope he is getting something in mind that makes him\r\nthink life worth living. It is strange that every lawyer I know\r\nwould like to be situated just as George is, with a little farm in\r\na quiet dell. Last night I talked with Senator Sutherland. It is\r\nhis hope sometime to reach this ideal. And the other night I\r\ntalked with Justice Lamar, and told him of George's life, and he\r\nsaid that he had dreamt of such an existence for fifty years but\r\nhas never been able to see his way to its realization.\r\n\r\nThere is no chance of our getting out to the Coast this year. The\r\nPresident expects us to be within call, and I am very much\r\ninterested in the Mexican question, as to which I have presented a\r\nprogram to him which so far he has accepted. These are times of\r\nterrible strain upon him. I saw him last night for a couple of\r\nhours, and the responsibility of the situation weighs terribly\r\nupon him. How to keep us out of war and at the same time maintain\r\nour dignity--this is a task certainly large enough for the largest\r\nof men.\r\n\r\nConditions politically are very unsettled, and much will turn I\r\nsuppose on what Congress does. More and more I am getting to\r\nbelieve that it would be a good thing to have universal military\r\nservice. To have a boy of eighteen given a couple of months for\r\ntwo or three years in the open would be a good thing for him and\r\nwould develop a very strong national sense, which we much lack.\r\nThe country believes that a man must be paid for doing anything\r\nfor his country. We even propose to pay men for the time they put\r\nin drilling, so as to protect their own liberties and property.\r\nThis is absurd! We must all learn that sacrifices are necessary if\r\nwe are to have a country. The theory of the American people,\r\napparently, is that the country is to give, give, give, and buy\r\neverything that it gets.\r\n\r\nHope things are going well with you. Drop me a line when you can.\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS\r\n\r\nROME, ITALY\r\n\r\nWashington, July 30, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--Things have come to such a tension here that I\r\ndoubt the wisdom of my discussing international politics with you;\r\nnevertheless, I want you not to be weary in well-doing, but\r\ncontinue to give me the views of the Tory Squire. I hope that your\r\nadmiration for Balfour will prove justified. Of course, our press,\r\nwhich can not be said to sympathize strongly with the conservative\r\nside, makes it appear that Lloyd George is now bearing a great\r\npart in the work of securing ammunition. This is the inevitable\r\nresult of allowing the people to vote. The man who has the\r\npeople's confidence proves to be the most useful in a time of\r\nemergency. However, it may be that Balfour is himself directing\r\nall that Lloyd George does.\r\n\r\nThis morning's papers contain an official statement from Petrograd\r\nsuggesting that the English get to work upon the west line. This\r\nseems to me extremely unkind, inasmuch as the English have already\r\nlost over 300,000 and have furnished a large amount of money to\r\nRussia, I understand.\r\n\r\nPfeiffer sent me an article the other day from a German professor,\r\nin which he said that the three million men that Kitchener talked\r\nabout was all a bluff. Pfeiffer keeps sending me long protests\r\nagainst England's attitude regarding our trade, which seem to me\r\nto be fair statements of international law.\r\n\r\nThe word that I get rather leads me to believe that the war will\r\nlast for at least another year and a half, which is quite in line\r\nwith Kitchener's prophecy, but where will all these countries be\r\nfrom a financial standpoint at the end of that time? I fancy some\r\nof them will have to go into bankruptcy and actually repudiate\r\ntheir debt, and what will become by that time of the high-spirited\r\nFrench, who are holding three hundred and fifty miles of line\r\nagainst eleven held by the British and thirty by the Belgians?\r\n\r\nYesterday I received a request from a German Independence League\r\nfor my resignation, as I was born under the British flag and was\r\nsupposed to be influential with the President, who has recently\r\nsent a very direct and business-like letter to Germany. My answer\r\nwas that they had mistaken my nationality. My real name was Lange\r\nand my father had stricken out the G.! Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EUGENE A. AVERY\r\n\r\nWashington, August 2, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR AVERY,--I am very glad to hear from you and to get your\r\nverse. I had a glorious time at Berkeley. I could have received no\r\nhonor that would have given me greater satisfaction, but oh! as I\r\nlook over that old list of professors and associate professors! I\r\ndon't know a tenth of them, and I never heard of half of them. How\r\nfar I am removed from the scholastic life, and how far we both are\r\nfrom those old days when you used to sit with your pipe in your\r\nmouth, in front of your cabin, and discourse to me upon God and\r\nmen!\r\n\r\nWell, we don't any of us know any more about God, but we know\r\nsomething more about man. But after all is said and done, I guess\r\nI like him about as much, as I did in the enthusiastic days when\r\nwe used to quiz old Moses. The streak of ideality that I had then\r\nI still retain. The reason that I have remained a Democrat is\r\nbecause I felt that we gave prime concern to the interests of men,\r\nas such, and had more faith that we could help on a revolution.\r\n\r\nThese are times of trial. The well we look into is very deep. The\r\nstars are not very bright. It is hard to find our way, but the\r\npilot has a good nerve. I know the trouble that Ulysses had with\r\nScylla and Charybdis.\r\n\r\nThank you, old man, very heartily for your word of cheer.\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN F. DAVIS\r\n\r\nWashington, August 2, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--I am very glad to get your letter of July 28,\r\ntelling me your views regarding the last note. I believe the\r\nparagraph to which you refer was absolutely essential to make\r\nGermany understand that we meant business; that she could not have\r\ntaken our opposition seriously is evidenced by her previous note,\r\nand which, I think, was as insulting as any note ever addressed by\r\none power to another. Think of the absurd proposition, that we\r\nshould be allowed a certain number of ships to be prescribed by\r\nGermany upon which our people could sail! Of course, if we\r\naccepted her conditions, we would have to accept the conditions\r\nthat any other belligerent, or neutral, for that matter, might\r\nimpose. What becomes of a neutral's rights under these conditions?\r\n\r\nThe Leenalaw case shows that Germany can do exactly what we have\r\nbeen asking her to do; namely, give people a chance to get off the\r\nship before they blow her up. This is good sense and good morals;\r\nand the whole neutral world is behind us. If, in response to our\r\nnote, Germany had said, \"We regret the destruction of American\r\nlives, and are willing to make reparation, and have directed our\r\nsubmarines that they shall not torpedo any ships until the ship\r\nhas been given an opportunity to halt,\" there would have been no\r\ntrouble; but Germany evidently did not take us seriously. Our\r\nEnglish was a bit too diplomatic.\r\n\r\nI am writing you thus frankly, and in confidence, of course,\r\nbecause I respect your opinion greatly. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n In the middle of August, Lane joined his family at Essex-on-\r\nChamplain, New York, for a few days. While there he went with Mr.\r\nand Mrs. James S. Harlan to Westport, some miles further south on\r\nthe lake, to see the summer boat races and water sports. Mr.\r\nHarlan's motor-boat, the Gladwater, which had been built on his\r\ndock by Dick Mead, won the race, and that evening on their return\r\nLane gave the following letter to the successful builder:--\r\n\r\nAugust 21, 1915\r\n\r\nTo \"Dick\" Mead on winning the race at Westport in the Gladwater.\r\n\r\nWe wonder sometimes why man was made, so full is life of things\r\nthat terrorize, that sadden and embitter. This life is a sea;\r\ntranquil sometimes but so often fierce and cruel. And you and I\r\nare conscript sailors. Whether we will or no we must sail the sea\r\nof life, and in a ship that each must build for himself. To each\r\nis given iron and unhewn timber, to some more and to some less,\r\nwith which to fashion his craft. Then the race really starts.\r\n\r\nSome of us build ships that are no more than rafts, formless, lazy\r\nthings that float. Fair weather things for moonlight nights. But\r\nothers, high-hearted men of vision, will not be satisfied to drift\r\nwith the current or accept the easy way. They know that they can\r\ndo better than drift, and they must! The timber and the iron\r\nbecome plastic under their touch. The dreams of the long night\r\nthey test in the too-short day. They make and they unmake; they\r\ndrop their tools perhaps for a time and drift; they despair and\r\ncurse their impatient and unsatisfied souls. But rising, they set\r\nto work again, and one day comes the reward, the planks fit\r\ntogether, and feeling the purpose of the builder, clasp each other\r\nin firm and beautiful lines; the unwilling metal at last melts\r\ninto form and place and becomes the harmonious heart of the whole\r\n--and so a ship is born that masters the cruel sea, that cuts the\r\nfierce waves with a knife of courage.\r\n\r\nTo dream and model, to join and file, to melt and carve, to\r\nbalance and adjust, to test and to toil--these are the making of\r\nthe ship. And to a few like yourself comes the vision of the true\r\nline and the glory of the victory. Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS\r\n\r\nROME, ITALY\r\n\r\nWashington, August 31, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,-- ... I met three friends of yours in New York the\r\nother day, Lamb, Fletcher, and Pfeiffer, to whom I told in my\r\ndismal way, the correspondence that we have been carrying on, and\r\nall sympathized with me very sincerely.\r\n\r\nThings look brighter now. The President seems to have been able to\r\nmake Germany hear him at last. I am very much surprised that you\r\nthink we ought to enter the war. Now that you have secured Italy\r\nto intervene, what is the necessity? What have you to offer by way\r\nof a bribe? I see that you are distributing territory generously.\r\nOr do you think that we should go in because we were threatened as\r\nEngland was--although she says it was Belgium that brought her in?\r\nFletcher is very much for fighting; Lamb says that the Allies will\r\nwin in the next two weeks. Pfeiffer thinks that nobody will win. I\r\ncan't tell you what I think. If I were only nearer I would have\r\nmore fun with you. Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n TO SIDNEY E. MEZES\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT OF THE COLLEGE OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK\r\n\r\nWashington, September 7, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SID,--I enclose a more formal letter for presentation to\r\nyour friend, Baron de--. Why in hell you should plague me with\r\nthis thing, except that I am the only real good-natured man\r\nconnected with the Government, I don't understand. Speaking of\r\ngood nature reminds me that you are a clam; in fact, a clam is\r\nvociferous alongside of you.\r\n\r\nAs you know I have been guiding the affairs of this Government for\r\nthe past three months, and have received advice from every man,\r\nwoman, and child in the country, including the German-American\r\nUnion, the Independent Union, the Friends of Peace, the Sons of\r\nHibernia, and all the other troglodytes that live; and yet, you\r\nalone have not thought me of sufficient consequence to advise me\r\nas to what to do with the Kaiser or Carranza or Hoke Smith or\r\nRoosevelt.\r\n\r\nBefore you go back to work why don't you come down here and spend\r\na day or two? We can have a perfectly bully time, and I will tell\r\nyou how to run your University and you can tell me how to run the\r\nGovernment. ...\r\n\r\nI have not seen House nor heard from him, though I have wanted to\r\ntalk with him more than with any other human being, these three\r\nmonths gone. Yours as always,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n TO CORDENIO SEVERANCE\r\n\r\nWashington, September 13, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CORDY,--I envy you very much the opportunity that you have\r\nto entertain Miss Nancy Lane. [Footnote: Born January 4, 1903.]\r\nWhen she is herself, she is a most charming young lady. She has\r\npowers of fascination excelled by few. If she grows angry, owing\r\nto her artistic temperament, and throws plates at you or chases\r\nyou out of the house with a broom, you must forgive her because\r\nyou know that great artists like Sarah Bernhardt often have this\r\nfailing.\r\n\r\nPerhaps you do not know it, but she used to be a great violinist\r\nin her younger days. I doubt if she knows one string from another\r\nnow. The only strings that she can play on are your heart strings,\r\nor mine, or any other man's that comes into her neighborhood. I\r\nshall rely upon your honor not to propose to her, because she is\r\nalready engaged to me; in fact, we have been engaged nearly twelve\r\nyears, and if she should become engaged to you, I will sue you for\r\nstealing her affections and will engage the firm of Davis Kellogg\r\nand Severance to prosecute my suit. If she says anything about a\r\ndesire to get back to school, you can put it down as a bluff, and\r\nI trust that you will not swamp her with attentions and with\r\ncompany lest it should turn her head. She is accustomed to the\r\nsimple life--a breakfast of oatmeal porridge, a luncheon of boiled\r\nmacaroni, and a dinner of hash--these are the three things that\r\nshe is used to. If she shows any disposition to be affectionate\r\ntoward you or Aunt Maidie, I trust that you will repress her with\r\nan iron hand. The young women of this day, as you know, are very\r\nforward, and these new dances seem to be especially designed to\r\ndestroy maiden modesty.\r\n\r\n... You may tell her that her brother seems to be very anxious to\r\nhear from her, being solicitous two or three times a day as to the\r\nmail. I judge from this that he is expecting a letter from her--or\r\nsomeone else.\r\n\r\nYou are very good to be giving my little one such a fine time. My\r\nlove to Maidie. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n TO FREDERICK DIXON\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR\r\n\r\nWashington, October 7, 1915\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. DIXON,--I have your letter of October 1st. You have asked\r\nme a very difficult question, which is really this:--How to get\r\ninto a man's nature an appreciation of our form of government and\r\nits benefits?\r\n\r\nI cannot answer this question. There are certain natures which do\r\nnot sympathize with the exercise of or the development of common\r\nauthority, which is the essence of Democracy. They are\r\ninstinctively monarchists. They love order more than liberty. They\r\ndo not see how a balance can be struck between the two. By force\r\nof environment and education their sons may see otherwise. I know\r\nof no other way of making Americans, than by getting into them by\r\nenvironment and education a love for liberty and a recognition of\r\nits advantages. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n TO ROBERT H. PATCHIN\r\n\r\nWashington, November 27, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PATCHIN,--Mrs. Lane and I would be delighted to join in\r\nyour fiesta to Mrs. Eleanor Egan, but we just can't. Why? Because\r\nwe have a dinner on December 2nd, also because we are neutral. ...\r\n\r\nWe can not countenance any one who has been in jail. To have been\r\nin jail proves poverty. Nor do we regard it as fitting that a\r\nyoung woman should have been torpedoed and spent forty-five\r\nminutes in the water splashing around like Mrs. Lecks or Mrs.\r\nAleshine. If she was torpedoed why didn't she go down or up like a\r\nheroine? Then she would have had an atrocious iron statue erected\r\nin her honor among the other horrors in Central Park. After her\r\nexperience she will doubtless be more sympathetic toward those of\r\nus who are torpedoed daily and weekly and monthly and have to\r\nsplash around for the amusement of a curious public.\r\n\r\nI hope your dinner of welcome and rejoicing will be as gay as the\r\ncherubic smile of the Right Honorable Egan. Cordially,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTO FRANCIS R. WALL\r\n\r\nWashington, November 27, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WALL,--I wish that I had time for a long letter to you,\r\nsuch as yours to me. But I am only to-day able to get at my\r\npersonal correspondence which has accumulated in the last six\r\nweeks. These have been times of annual reports and estimates, and\r\nwe have a large number of internal troubles which need constant\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that we are going to have a great deal of trouble in\r\ngetting our preparedness program through, because of dissension in\r\nour own ranks and because the Republicans are so anxious to take\r\nadvantage of this emergency to raise the tariff duties and to gain\r\ncredit for whatever is done in the way of preparation. We are too\r\nmuch dominated by partisanship to be really patriotic. This is a\r\nvery broad indictment, but it seems to be justified. Of course,\r\nthe people like Bryan and Ford, and the women generally, are moved\r\nby a philosophy that is too idealistic, and some of them are only\r\nmoved, I fear, by an intense exaggerated ego. If I would have to\r\nname the one curse of the present day, I would say it is the love\r\nof notoriety and the assumption by almost everyone that his\r\njudgment is as good as that of the ablest. Of course, the trouble\r\nwith the ablest people is that they are so largely moved by forces\r\nthat do not appear on the surface, that one does not know that the\r\nviews they express are really their own judgment. Democracy seems\r\nto be government by suspicion, in large part. We have faith in\r\nourselves, but not in each other. A man to be a good partisan\r\nseems called upon to believe that every man of different view is a\r\ncrook or a weakling. This is the Roosevelt idea. And half of it is\r\nthe Bryan idea.\r\n\r\nI wish that I could see you, old man, and have one of our old time\r\ntalks. ...\r\n\r\nI shall bear in mind what you say as to the availability of your\r\nservice, but I hope it may not be necessary to take you from that\r\nland of sunshine and dreams that seems so remote from this center\r\nof intrigue and trouble. Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN H. WIGMORE\r\n\r\nWashington, December 8, 1915\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,-- ... Things are not looking at all nice as to\r\nGermany and Austria. I know that the country is not satisfied, at\r\nleast part of it, with our patience, but I don't see just what\r\nelse we can do but be patient. Our ships are not needed anywhere,\r\nand our soldiers do not exist. To-day brings word of the blowing\r\nup of an American ship. Of course, we do not know the details but\r\nthe thing looks ugly.\r\n\r\nWasn't the President's message on the hyphenated gentlemen bully?\r\nYou could not have beaten that yourself. And your dear friend T.\r\nRoosevelt, did certainly write himself down as one large and\r\nglorious ass in his criticism of the message. He hates Wilson so,\r\nthat he has just lost his mind. I wish I didn't have to say this\r\nabout Roosevelt, because I am extremely fond of him (which you are\r\nnot), but a poorer interview on the message could not have been\r\nwritten. ... As always yours,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following letter was written to Mrs. Adolph Miller when she\r\nwas in a hospital in New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADOLPH C. MILLER\r\n\r\nWashington, December 12, [1915]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MARY,--We have just returned from Church and all morning I\r\nhave been thinking of you and Adolph--praying for you I suppose\r\nin my Pagan way.\r\n\r\nPoor dear girl, I know you are brave but I'd just like to hold\r\nyour hand or look steadily into your eyes, to tell you that you\r\nhave the best thing that this world gives--friends who are one\r\nwith you. I can see old Adolph with his grimness and his great\r\nlove, which makes him more grim and far more mandatory, what a\r\nsturdy old Dutch Calvinist he is! He really is more Dutch than\r\nGerman--Dutch modified by the California sun--and Calvinist\r\nsweetened by you and Boulder Creek, and Berkeley and William James\r\nand B. I. Wheeler and his Saint of a Mother. Well, let him pass,\r\nwhy should I talk of him when you really want me to talk of\r\nmyself!\r\n\r\nLast night we had the GRIDIRON dinner, and the President made an\r\nexalted speech. He is spiritually great, Mary, and don't you dare\r\nsmile and think of the widow! We are all dual, old Emerson said it\r\nin his ESSAY ON FREE WILL, and Adolph can tell you what old Greek\r\nsaid it. And this duality is where the fight comes in, and the two\r\npeople walk side by side, to-day is Jekyll's day, and tomorrow is\r\nHyde's, and so they alternate.\r\n\r\nWell, the GRIDIRON was a grind on Bryan and Villard and Ford, and\r\na boost for preparedness and Garrison and the Army and Navy. Tell\r\nAdolph they had a Democratic mule, two men walking together under\r\na cover, the head end reasonable, the hind end kicking--the front\r\nend of course represented the Wilson crowd and the hind end the\r\nBryan-Kitchin,--and the two wouldn't work together. The whole\r\nthing was splendidly done and was a lesson to the few Democrats\r\nwho were there--which they won't learn.\r\n\r\nNancy went to her second party last night--a joyous thing in a new\r\nevening cloak of old rose, which made her feel that Cleopatra and\r\nthe Queen of Sheba and Mrs. Galt and all other exalted ladies had\r\nnothing on her. What a glorious thing life would be if we could\r\nremain children, with all the simple joys and none of the horrors\r\nthat age brings on. There is certainly a good fifty per cent\r\nchance that this fine spirit will marry some damn brute who will\r\nworry and harass the soul out of her. For so the world goes. I\r\nhope she'll be as fortunate as you have been.\r\n\r\nTo-night we go to the Polks to see Mrs. Martin Egan who was on a\r\ntorpedoed ship in the Mediterranean, and although she couldn't\r\nswim floated forty-five minutes till rescued. You must know the\r\nPolks well. She has very real charm and your old Mormon of a\r\nhusband will desert his other fairies for her.\r\n\r\nNow I have gossiped and preached and prophesied and mourned and\r\notherwise revealed what passes through a wandering mind in half an\r\nhour, so I send you, at the close of this screed, my blessing,\r\nwhich is a poor gift, and I would send you the parcel post limit\r\nof my love if it weren't for Anne and Adolph, who are narrow-\r\nminded Dutch Calvinists. May good fortune betide you and bring you\r\nback very soon to the many whose hearts are sympathetic.\r\n\r\nFRANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. MAGNUS ANDERSEN\r\n\r\nWashington, D.C., December 24, [1915]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MAUDIE,--It is Christmas eve, and while Nancy and Anne are\r\nfilling the mysterious stockings, I am writing these letters to\r\nthe best of brothers and sister. It has been a long, a\r\ndisgracefully long time since I wrote you, but I have kept in\r\ntouch pretty well through George and Anne. ... So you have now a\r\nphilosophy--something to hang to! I am glad of it. The standpoint\r\nis the valuable thing. There are profound depths in the idea that\r\nlies under Christian Science, but like all other new things it\r\ngoes to unreasonable lengths. \"Be Moderate,\" were the words\r\nwritten over the Temple on the Acropolis, and this applies to all\r\nthings. This world is curiously complex, and no one knows how to\r\nanswer all our puzzles. Sometimes I think that God himself does\r\nnot. There is a fine poem by Emerson called, THE SPHINX, which is\r\nthe most hopeful thing that I have found, because it recognizes\r\nthe dual world in which we live, for everything goes not singly\r\nbut in pairs--good and evil, matter and mind. Then, too, you may\r\nbe interested in his essay on FATE.\r\n\r\nDear Fritz--dear, dear boy, how I wish I could be there with him,\r\nthough I could do no good. ... Each night I pray for him, and I am\r\nso much of a Catholic that I pray to the only Saint I know or ever\r\nknew and ask her to help. If she lives her mind can reach the\r\nminds of the doctors just as surely as there is such a thing as\r\ntransmission of thought between us, or hypnotism. I don't need her\r\nto intercede with God, but I would like her to intercede with man.\r\nWhy, oh why, do we not know whether she is or not! Then all the\r\nuniverse would be explained to me. The only miracle that I care\r\nabout is the resurrection. If we live again we certainly have\r\nreason for living now. I think that belief is the foundation hope\r\nof religion. Anne has it with a certainty that is to me nothing\r\nless than amazing. And people of noble minds, of exalted spirits,\r\nnot necessarily of greatest intellects have it. George has it in\r\nhis own way, and he is certainly one of the real men of the earth.\r\nThe President has it strongly. He is, in fact, deeply, truly\r\nreligious. The slanders on him are infamous.\r\n\r\n... We are to have the quietest possible Christmas. No one but\r\nourselves at dinner--I give no presents at all--for financially\r\nwe are up to our eyebrows. I probably will work all day except for\r\nan hour or two which I shall use in playing with Nancy, for her\r\ngay spirit will not allow anything but the Christmas spirit to\r\nprevail. She is so like our Dear One, so determined, cheerful,\r\nhopeful, courageous, yet very shy. Ned will be out all night at\r\ndances and tomorrow too, for he is a most popular chap and very\r\nwell-behaved indeed. His manners are excellent and he has plenty\r\nof dash. He is learning these things now which I learned only\r\nafter many years, the little things which make the conventional\r\nman of the world.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will find the New Year one of great peace of mind\r\nand real serenity of soul. May you commune with the Spirit of the\r\nInfinite and find yourself growing more and more in the spiritual\r\nimage of the Dear One.\r\n\r\nMy tenderest love to you and to your good high-hearted man, and to\r\nthe Boy.\r\n\r\nFRANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADOLPH C. MILLER\r\n\r\nWashington [1915]\r\n\r\nThis is a Christmas letter and is addressed:--\"To a Brave Young\r\nWoman.\" I am afraid it is not just as cheery and merry as it\r\nshould be because, you see, it's like this, I am poor--very, very\r\npoor, and I have very good taste--very, very good taste. Now\r\nthose two things can't get on together at Christmas. Then, too, I\r\nam busy--very, very busy, so I don't have time to shop. Now if you\r\nwere very, very poor and had very, very good taste and were very,\r\nvery busy and couldn't shop--how in heaven could you buy anything\r\nfor anyone?\r\n\r\nI did take half an hour or so to look at things, and things were\r\nso ugly that were cheap that of course I couldn't buy them without\r\nconfessing poor taste, or they were so very expensive that I\r\ncouldn't buy them without confessing bankruptcy. Now there you\r\nare! So what could a poor boy do but come home empty-handed,\r\nnothing for Anne or Nancy or Ned or you--not even something for\r\nmyself! And I need things, socks and pipe, and better writing\r\npaper than this, and music and toothpaste and some new clothes,\r\nand a house near your palace, and a more contented spirit and\r\nanother job and Ahellofalotof things. Don't get nervous about me,\r\nbecause I'm not going to kill myself for lack of all these things,\r\nalthough a true-born Samurai, loyal to Bushido might do so. For it\r\nis dishonor not to be rich at Christmas time; not to feel rich,\r\nanyway. But then let me see what I've got! There's Anne! I expect\r\nif sold on the block, at public auction, say in Alaska, where\r\nwomen are scarce, she would bring some price; but her digestion\r\nisn't very good and her heart is quite weak and her hair is\r\nfalling out. But these things, of course, the auctioneer wouldn't\r\nreveal. She would make a fine Duchess, but the market just now is\r\noverstocked with Duchesses. And she is a good provider when\r\nfurnished with the provisions.\r\n\r\nNow there is Ned--he could hire out as a male assistant to a\r\nfemale dancer and get fifty a week, perhaps. Nancy couldn't even\r\ndo that. They are both liabilities. So there you are, with\r\nDuchesses on the contraband list, and Nancy not old enough to\r\nmarry a decayed old Pittsburg millionaire, I will be compelled to\r\nkeep on working. For my assets aren't what your noble husband\r\nwould call quick, though they are live. I really don't know what\r\nto do. I shall wait till Anne comes home and then, as usual, do\r\nwhat she says.\r\n\r\nI really did look for something for you. But the only thing I saw\r\nthat I thought you would care for was a brooch, opal and diamonds\r\nfor seven hundred and seventy-five dollars, so I said you wouldn't\r\ncare for it. But I bought it for you A LA Christian Science. You\r\nhave it, see? I think you have it, that I gave it to you. And that\r\nAdolph doesn't know it, see?\r\n\r\nWell you have the opal and I am happy because you are enjoying it.\r\nSuch fire! What a superb setting! And such refined taste,\r\nplatinum, do you notice! oh, so modest! No one else has any such\r\njewel. How Henry will admire it--and how mystified Adolph is!\r\nTell him you bought it out of the money you saved on corned beef.\r\nHow I shall enjoy seeing you wear it, and knowing that it bears in\r\nits fiery heart all the ardent poetry that I would fain pour out,\r\nbut am deterred by my shyness. But you will understand! Each night\r\nyou must take it out just for a glimpse before saying your\r\nprayers. The opal is from Australia, the platinum from Siberia,\r\nthe diamonds from Africa, the setting was designed in Paris. And\r\nhere it is, the circle of the world has been made to secure this\r\nlittle thing of beauty for you. What symbolism!\r\n\r\nI hope it will make you happy, and cause you to forget all your\r\npain and weakness. It has given me great happiness to give you\r\nthis little gift. And so we will both have a merry Christmas.\r\n\r\nFRANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nAMERICAN AND MEXICAN AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n1916\r\n\r\nOn Writing English--Visit to Monticello--Citizenship for Indians--On\r\nReligion--American-Mexican Joint Commission\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM M. BOLE\r\n\r\nGREAT FALLS TRIBUNE\r\n\r\nWashington, December 29, 1915\r\n\r\nDEAR BOLE,--I am very much gratified by the manner in which you\r\ntreated my annual report. Certainly my old newspaper training has\r\nstood me in good stead in writing my reports. In fact it always\r\nhas, for while I was Corporation Counsel in San Francisco, and a\r\nmember of the Interstate Commerce Commission, I wrote legal\r\nopinions that were intelligible to the layman, and I tried to\r\npresent my facts in such manner as to make their presentation\r\ninteresting. The result was that the courts read my opinions and\r\nsustained them, but whether they were equally impressive upon the\r\nstrictly legal mind, I have my doubts, because you know inside the\r\n\"union\" there is a strong feeling that the argot of the bar must\r\nbe spoken and the simplest legal questions dealt with in profound,\r\nphilosophic, latinized vocabulary.\r\n\r\nI remember that after I was elected Corporation Counsel, when I\r\nwas almost unknown to the bar of San Francisco, I began to hear\r\ncriticism from my legal friends that my opinions were written in\r\nEnglish that was too simple, so I indulged myself by writing a\r\ndozen or so in all the heavy style that I could put on, writing in\r\nas many Latin phrases and as much old Norman French as was\r\npossible. This was by way of showing the crowd that I was still a\r\nmember of the union.\r\n\r\nI find that all our scientific bureaus suffer from the same\r\nmalady. These scientists write for each other, as the women say\r\nthey dress for each other. One of the first orders that I issued\r\nwas that our letters should be written in simple English, in words\r\nof one syllable if possible, and on one page if possible.\r\n\r\nSoon after I came here I found a letter from one of our lawyers to\r\nan Indian, explaining the conditions of his title, that was so\r\ninvolved and elaborately braided and beaded and fringed that I\r\ncould not understand it myself. I outraged the sensibilities of\r\nevery lawyer in the Department, and we have five hundred or more\r\nof them, by sending this letter back and asking that it be put in\r\nstraightaway English. ... Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADOLPH C. MILLER\r\n\r\nWashington, [January 1, 1916]\r\n\r\nHaving just sent a wire to you I shall now indulge myself in a few\r\nminutes talk with that many-sided, multiple-natured, quite\r\nobvious-and-yet-altogether-hidden person who is known to me as\r\nMary Miller.\r\n\r\nThe flash of brilliant crimson on the eastern side of the opal, do\r\nyou catch it? Now that is the flash of courage, the brilliant\r\nflame that will lead you to hold your head high. ... I like very\r\nmuch what you say as to wearing our jewel \"discreetly but\r\nconstantly.\" No combination of words could more perfectly express\r\nthe relationship which this bit of sunrise has established between\r\nus--devotion, loyalty, telepathic communication without publicity.\r\nI am sure you are belittling yourself. ... you are a game bird,--\r\ngood, you understand, but with a tang, a something wild in flavor,\r\na touch of the woods and mountain flowers and hidden dells in\r\nbosky places, and wanderings and sweet revolt against captivity.\r\n...\r\n\r\nThis is my first line of the New Year. Anne is a true daughter of\r\nMartha this morning--her heart is troubled with many things,\r\ngetting ready for the raid of the Huns this afternoon. She says\r\nshe will write when she repossesses herself of her right arm. Good\r\nhealth!\r\n\r\nSome days later\r\n\r\n... I have been receiving your wireless messages all week, my dear\r\nMary, and not one was an S. O. S. Good! The fair ship MARY MILLER\r\nis safe. Hurrah! She never has been staunch, but she was the\r\ngayest thing on the sea, and when her sails were all set from jib\r\nto spanker she made a gladsome sight, and some speed.\r\n\r\nOf course, being so gay she was venturesome. That's where the\r\nDevil comes in. He is always looking about for the gay things. He\r\nhates anything that doesn't make medicine for him. If you are gay\r\nyou are likely to be venturesome, and if venturesome, you can be\r\nled astray. So the good ship MARY MILLER instead of hugging the\r\nshore took a try at the vasty deep and got all blown to pieces.\r\nThen she sent out a cry for help. The wireless worked and now with\r\na little puttering along in the sunshine and a lazy sea, she will\r\nbe her gay self once more, and like Kipling's Three Decker will\r\n\"carry tired people to the Islands of the Blest.\"\r\n\r\nThat was a most charming letter you sent me, a real bit of\r\nintimate talk. Anne read it first. She is very careful as to my\r\nreading. And I was glad to know that she could discover nothing in\r\nit which might injuriously affect my trustful young mind. Anne is\r\nreally a good woman. I don't believe in husband's abusing their\r\nwives, publicly. Good manners are essential to happiness in\r\nmarried life. We are short on manners in this country, and that\r\nexplains the prevalence of divorce. How much better, as our friend\r\nL. Sterne once said, \"These things are ordered in France.\"\r\n\r\nF. K L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDWARD F. ADAMS\r\n\r\nSAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE\r\n\r\nWashington, January 11, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ADAMS,--I have yours of the 2nd. Of course, you can not\r\nsue the United States to get possession of its property without\r\nthe consent of the United States; but I will forgive you for all\r\nyour peculiar and archaic notions regarding government lands and\r\nschools and sich, because I love you for what you are and not\r\nbecause of your inheritance of old-fashioned ideas.\r\n\r\nAs I am dictating this letter I look up at the wall and discover\r\nthere the head of a bull moose, and that bull moose makes me think\r\nof all the things you said four years ago about Roosevelt. And now\r\nhe is to be again the master of your party--perhaps not a\r\ncandidate, because he may be guilty of an act of self-abnegation\r\nand put away the crown, or take it in his own hands and place it\r\nupon some one else's brow.\r\n\r\nI remember the manner--the scornful, satirical, sometimes pitiful\r\nand sometimes abusive manner--in which you treated the Bull Moose;\r\nand so we are going to have a great spectacle, the Bull Moose and\r\nthe Elephant kissing each other at Chicago; and seated on the\r\nElephant's shoulders will be the crowned mahout with the big\r\nbarbed stick in his hand, telling you which way to turn and when\r\nto kneel!\r\n\r\nOf course, you will abuse us all for our land policies, but\r\noverlook the fact that the brutalities of these policies were\r\ncommitted in other days--those good, old Republican days. It\r\nreally is a wonder that you are not cynical and that you still\r\nhave enthusiasm. I should not be surprised if you said your\r\nprayers and had belief in another world, where all the bad\r\nDemocrats would sizzle to the eternal joy of the good Republicans.\r\nIn those days I shall look up to you and I know that you will not\r\ndeny me the drop of cold water.\r\n\r\nI shall be very much interested in seeing what kind of a fist our\r\nman Claxton makes out of your school system, and I hope you can\r\nuse him as a means of arousing interest in the schools. That is\r\none trouble with the public school system, because we get our\r\neducation for nothing we treat it as if it was worth nothing--I\r\nmean those of us who are parents. We never know that the school\r\nexists except to make some complaint about discipline or taxes.\r\n\r\nMay you live long and be happy. Always yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time to time as vacancies occurred on the Supreme Bench,\r\nletters and telegrams came to Lane from friends that begged him to\r\nallow them to urge his appointment to this office. In 1912, 1914,\r\nand 1916 the newspapers in different parts of the country\r\nmentioned him as a probable appointee. While, as a young lawyer,\r\nthis office had seemed to him to be one greatly to be desired,\r\nafter he came to Washington and knew more of the nature of the\r\ncases that necessarily formed the greater part of the work passed\r\nupon by the Supreme Court, his interest waned. As early as 1913 he\r\nwrote of the decisions of the Interstate Commerce Commission, \"If\r\nwe are wise, we are not to be terrorized by our own precedents.\"\r\nAn office in which there was little opportunity for constructive\r\nor executive work grew to have less and less attraction for him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Carl Snyder\r\n\r\nWashington, January 22, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CARL,--I am your most dutiful and obedient servant; the\r\naforesaid modest declaration being induced by your letter of\r\nJanuary fifth, offering to place me on the Bench. I regret greatly\r\nthat you are not the President of the United States, but he seems\r\nto have a notion that it would be a shame to spoil an excellent\r\nSecretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\nTalking of robes, there is an idea in Chesterton that is not bad,\r\nthat all those who exercise power in the world wear skirts--the\r\njudge, who can officially kill a man; the woman, who can\r\nunofficially do the same thing; and the King, who is the State;\r\nlikewise the Pope, who can save the souls of all.\r\n\r\nGarrett was in to-day, and if you haven't seen him since his\r\nreturn, edge up next to him. He is full of facts, some of which\r\nare new to us.\r\n\r\nI guess I am to credit you with that little editorial in\r\nCollier's, eh? Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Franklin K. Lane\r\n\r\nAtlantic City\r\n\r\nWashington, February 5, 1916\r\n\r\nMOST RESPECTED LADY,--Having just returned from luncheon and being\r\nin the enjoyment of a cigar of fine aroma I sit me down for a\r\nquiet talk. I am visualizing you as by my side and addressing you\r\nin person.\r\n\r\nFirst, no doubt, you will care to hear of the reception given at\r\nthe White House last evening. According to your directions, I\r\nfirst dined with the Secretary of Agriculture, his wife, and a\r\nlady from Providence. ... Going then to the White House we\r\nsocialized for a few minutes before proceeding down stairs. The\r\nPresident expressed himself as regretting your absence, and the\r\nPresident's lady, having heard from you, expressed solicitude as\r\nto your health. I loitered for a few minutes behind the line and\r\nthen betook me to the President's library, where I spent most of\r\nthe evening hearing the Postmaster General tell of the great\r\nburden that it was to have a Congress on his hands. Bernard Shaw\r\nwrites of the Superman, and so does, I believe, the crazy\r\nphilosopher of Germany. I was convinced last night that I had met\r\none in the flesh. ...\r\n\r\nThe President is cheerful, regarding his Western tour as one of\r\ntriumph. His lady still wears the smile which has given her such\r\npre-eminence. Mrs. Marshall was in line, looking like a girl of\r\ntwenty. Those absent were the Wife of the Secretary of War, the\r\nwife of the Secretary of the Interior, and the wife of the\r\nSecretary of Labor. ...\r\n\r\nYou have two most excellent children, dear madam--a youth of some\r\neighteen years who has a frisky wit and a more frisky pair of\r\nfeet. Your daughter is a most charming witch. I mean by this not\r\nto refer to her age ... but to that combination of poise,\r\ndirectness, tenderness, fire, hypocrisy, and other feminine\r\nvirtues which go to make up the most charming, because the most\r\nelusive, of your sex. I am inclined to believe that Mr. Ruggles,\r\nof Red Gap, would not regard either your son or your daughter as\r\nfitted for those high social circles in which they move by reason\r\nof the precision of their vocabulary or their extreme reserve in\r\nmanner, both being of very distinct personality. One is flint and\r\nthe other steel, I find, so that fire is struck when they come\r\ntogether. While engaged, however, in the game of draw poker, these\r\nantipathetic qualities do not reveal themselves in such a manner\r\nas to seriously affect domestic peace. I have spent two entire\r\nevenings with your children, much to my entertainment. That I will\r\nnot be able to enjoy this evening with them is a matter of regret,\r\nbut I am committed to a dinner with the Honorable Kirke Porter,\r\nand tomorrow evening I believe that I am to dine with the lady on\r\nR. Street, the name of the aforesaid lady being now out of my\r\nmind, but you will recall her as having a brilliant mind and very\r\nslight eyebrows.\r\n\r\nNeither the President nor myself alluded to the late lamented\r\noversight on his part, and on meeting the members of the Supreme\r\nCourt I did not find that by the omission to appoint me on said\r\nCourt the members thereof felt that a great national loss had been\r\nsuffered. No one, in fact, throughout the evening alluded to this\r\nmiscarriage of wisdom. ...\r\n\r\n... Much solicitude was expressed by many of those present\r\nregarding your health. I told them in my off-hand manner that I\r\nwas enjoying your absence greatly. ...\r\n\r\nHaving now had this most enjoyable talk with you, I shall delight\r\nmyself with an hour's discussion of oil leases upon the Osage\r\nReservation with one Cato Sells.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear madam, your most respectful obedient, humble,\r\nmeek, modest, mild, loyal, loving, and disconsolate servant,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILL IRWIN\r\n\r\nWashington, February 11, 1916\r\n\r\nDEAR WILL,--So you are off for the happiest voyage you have ever\r\nmade, with the girl of your heart, to see the whole world being\r\nchanged and a new world made. What a joy! Don't put off returning\r\ntoo long. Remember that books must be timely now, and after you\r\nhave a gizzard full of good chapter headings, come back and grind.\r\n\r\nNancy entirely approves of your wife and her books. As always\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO--\r\n\r\nWashington, February 29, 1916\r\n\r\n... It is none of my business, but I have just seen an article\r\ncoming out over your name respecting Pinchot, the wisdom of which\r\nI doubt. I have never found any good to come by blurring an issue\r\nby personal contest or antagonisms. You asked me when you left if\r\nyou might not come in once in a while and talk with me, and I am\r\ntaking the liberty in this way of dropping in on you, for I am\r\ndeeply interested in water power development and want to see\r\nsomething result this Session.\r\n\r\nI have no time to waste in fighting people, and I have found that\r\nby pursuing this policy I can promote measures that I favor. To\r\nfight for a thing, the best way is to show its advantages and the\r\nneed for it, and ignore those who do not take the same view,\r\nbecause there is an umpire in Congress that must balance the two\r\npositions, and therefore I can rely upon the strength of my\r\nposition as against the weakness of the other man's position. If\r\nthose who are in favor of water power development get to fighting\r\neach other, nothing will result.\r\n\r\nI am giving you the benefit of this attitude of mine for your own\r\nguidance. It may be entirely contrary to the policy that you, or\r\nyour people, wish to pursue and my only solicitude is that the\r\nthings I am for, should not be held back any longer by personal\r\ndisputes. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTO HON. WOODROW WILSON\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\nWashington, March 13, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--I shall be pleased to go to the San Diego\r\nExposition, on my way to San Francisco, and say a word as your\r\nrepresentative at its opening.\r\n\r\nI hope that you may find your way made less difficult than now\r\nappears possible, as to entering Mexico, My judgment is that to\r\nfail in getting Villa would ruin us in the eyes of all Latin-\r\nAmericans. I do not say that they respect only force, but like\r\nchildren they pile insult upon insult if they are not stopped when\r\nthe first insult is given. If I can be of any service to you by\r\nobservation or by carrying any message for you to anybody, while I\r\nam West, I trust that you will command me. I can return by way of\r\nArizona and New Mexico. ... Faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLane re-opened the California International Exposition at San\r\nDiego, where, voicing the President's regret that he could not\r\nhimself be present, Lane said,--\"He had intended to make this trip\r\nhimself; but circumstances, some to the east of him and some to\r\nthe south of him, made that impossible. ... Pitted against him are\r\nthe trained and cunning intellects of the whole world, ... and no\r\none can be more conscious than is he that it is difficult to\r\nreconcile pride and patience. I give you his greeting therefore,\r\nnot out of a heart that is joyous and buoyant, but out of a heart\r\nthat is grave and firm in its resolution that the future of our\r\nRepublic and all republics shall not be put in peril.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: FRANKLIN K. LANE WITH ETHAN ALLEN,\r\nSUPERINTENDENT OF RAINIER NATIONAL PARK]\r\n\r\nFrom San Diego he went north to San Francisco, to see his brother\r\nFrederic J. Lane, who had been ill for some months. After a few\r\ndays with him Lane returned to his desk, in Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FREDERIC J. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, April 26, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRITZ,-- ... I certainly will not despair of your being\r\ncured until every possible resource has been exhausted. The odds,\r\nit seems to me, are in your favor. Whenever Abrams and Vecchi say\r\nthat they have done all that they can, if you are still in\r\ncondition to travel, I want you to try the Arkansas Hot Springs\r\nand I will go down there to meet you. ...\r\n\r\nI wrote you from the train the other day on my way to Harpers\r\nFerry, where I took an auto and went down through the Shenandoah\r\nValley and across the mountains to Charlottesville, where the\r\nUniversity of Virginia is. I went with the Harlans. Anne joined us\r\nat Charlottesville. ... We visited Monticello, where Jefferson\r\nlived, and saw a country quite as beautiful as any valley I know\r\nof in California, not even excepting the Santa Clara Valley, in\r\nprune blossom time. Those old fellows who built their houses a\r\nhundred years ago knew how to build and build beautifully. We have\r\nno such places in California as some that were built a hundred and\r\nfifty years ago in Virginia, and they did not care how far they\r\ngot away from town, in those days.\r\n\r\nJefferson's house is up on the top of a hill, as are most of the\r\nothers,--there are very few on the roads. Most of them are from a\r\nmile to five miles back, and although the land is covered with\r\ntimber they built of brick, and imported Italian laborers to do\r\nthe wood-carving. When I think of how much less in money and in\r\ntrouble make a place far more magnificent in California, I wonder\r\nour people have not lovelier places. Of course, the difference is\r\nthat in Virginia there were just three classes of people--the\r\naristocrat, the middle class, and the negroes. The aristocracy had\r\nthe land, the middle class were the artisans, and the negroes the\r\nslaves. The only ones who had fine houses were the aristocracy,\r\nwhereas with us the great mass of our people are business and\r\nprofessional men of comparatively small means and we have few men\r\nwho build palaces.\r\n\r\nThings have blown up in Ireland, I see, and the Irish are going to\r\nsuffer for this foolish venture. This man Casement who is posing\r\nas the George Washington of the Irish revolution, has held office\r\nall his life under the English Government and now draws a pension.\r\nHis last position was that of Consul General at Rio de Janeiro. I\r\ngot a pamphlet from him a year or so ago, in which he proposed an\r\nalliance between Germany, the Republic of Ireland, and the\r\nRepublic of the United States, which should control the politics\r\nof the world. ...\r\n\r\nDoesn't the thought of Henry Ford as Presidential candidate ...\r\nsurprise you? It looks to me very much as if the Ford vote\r\ndemonstrates Roosevelt's weakness as a candidate. Last night I\r\nwent to dinner at old Uncle Joe Cannon's house, and as I came out\r\nSenator O'Gorman pointed to Uncle Joe and Justice Hughes talking\r\ntogether and said, \"There is the old leader passing over the wand\r\nof power to the new leader.\" ...\r\n\r\nWell, old man, I know that I do not need to tell you to keep your\r\nspirits up and your faith strong. Give me all the news, good as\r\nwell as bad. Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRANK I. COBB\r\n\r\nNEW YORK WORLD\r\n\r\nWashington, May 8, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COBB,--Here is a memorandum that has been drafted\r\nrespecting the leasing bill, that we are now pushing to have taken\r\nup by the Senate. This bill, as you know, covers oil, phosphate,\r\nand potash lands. ... There are three million acres of phosphate\r\nlands, two and a half million acres of oil lands, and a small\r\nacreage of potash lands, under withdrawal now, that cannot be\r\ndeveloped because of lack of legislation. ...\r\n\r\nThe situation here is tense. Of course, nobody knows what will be\r\ndone. I favor telling Germany that we will make no trade with her,\r\nand if she fails to make good her word we will stop talking to her\r\naltogether. I am getting tired of having the Kaiser and Carranza\r\nvent their impudence at our expense, because they know we do not\r\nwant to go to war and because they want to keep their own people\r\nin line. ... Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. WICKERSHAM\r\n\r\nWashington, May 17, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WICKERSHAM,--I am just back from a trip to South Dakota,\r\nwhere I, by ritual, a copy of which is inclosed for your perusal,\r\nmade citizens out of a bunch of Indians who never can become\r\nhyphenates, and for this reason your letter has remained\r\nunanswered.\r\n\r\nAnd just because we love you, and love ourselves even better, we\r\nwill break all rules, precedents, promises, appointments,\r\nagreements, and covenants of all kinds whatsoever, and steal over\r\nto see you a week from Saturday. Just what hour I will wire you,\r\nand what time we can stay depends upon things various and sundry.\r\nBut you may depend upon it that it will be as long a time as a\r\nvery flexible conscience will permit.\r\n\r\nRemember me, in terms of endearment, to that noble lady who\r\ndesolated Washington by her departure. As always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO H. B. BROUGHAM\r\n\r\nWashington, May 20, 1916\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. BROUGHAM,-- ... I recently returned from the Yankton\r\nSioux Reservation in South Dakota where I admitted some one\r\nhundred and fifty competent Indians to full American citizenship\r\nin accordance with a ritual. ... The ceremony was really\r\nimpressive and taken quite seriously by the Indians. Why should\r\nnot some such ceremony as this be used when we give citizenship to\r\nforeigners who come to this country? Surely it tends to instil\r\npatriotism and presents the duties of citizenship in a manner that\r\nleaves a lasting impression. Here is a story that should be\r\ninteresting to all, if properly presented. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nINDIAN RITUAL ADMISSION TO CITIZENSHIP\r\n\r\nThe Secretary stands before one of the candidates and says:--\r\n\r\n\"Joseph T. Cook, what was your Indian name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tunkansapa,\" answers the Indian.\r\n\r\n\"Tunkansapa, I hand you a bow and arrow. Take this bow and shoot\r\nthe arrow.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian does so.\r\n\r\n\"Tunkansapa, you have shot your last arrow. That means you are no\r\nlonger to live the life of an Indian. You are from this day\r\nforward to live the life of the white man. But you may keep that\r\narrow. It will be to you a symbol of your noble race and of the\r\npride you may feel that you come from the first of all Americans.\"\r\n\r\nAddressing Tunkansapa by his white name.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph T. Cook, take in your hands this plough.\" Cook does so.\r\n\"This act means that you have chosen to live the life of the white\r\nman. The white man lives by work. From the earth we must all get\r\nour living, and the earth will not yield unless man pours upon it\r\nthe sweat of his brow.\r\n\r\n\"Joseph T. Cook, I give you a purse. It will always say to you\r\nthat the money you gain must be wisely kept. The wise man saves\r\nhis money, so that when the sun does not smile and the grass does\r\nnot grow he will not starve.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary now takes up the American flag. He and the Indian\r\nhold it together.\r\n\r\n\"I give into your hands the flag of your country. This is the only\r\nflag you ever will have. It is the flag of free men, the flag of a\r\nhundred million free men and women, of whom you are now one. That\r\nflag has a request to make of you, Joseph T. Cook, that you repeat\r\nthese words.\"\r\n\r\nCook then repeats the following after the Secretary.\r\n\r\n\"Forasmuch as the President has said that I am worthy to be a\r\ncitizen of the United States, I now promise this flag that I will\r\ngive my hands, my head, and my heart to the doing of all that will\r\nmake me a true American citizen.\"\r\n\r\nThe Secretary then takes a badge upon which is the American eagle,\r\nwith the national colors, and, pinning it upon the Indian's\r\nbreast, speaks as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"And now, beneath this flag, I place upon your breast the emblem\r\nof citizenship. Wear this badge always, and may the eagle that is\r\non it never see you do aught of which the flag will not be proud.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FREDERIC J. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, June 6, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRITZ,--We have a letter from Mary this morning saying you\r\nare holding your own pretty well, which is mighty good news, and\r\nthat Abrams is still convinced that he is right, which is also\r\ngood news. By the same mail I learn that Hugo Asher was hit by a\r\ntrain and nearly killed. Whether he will recover or not is a\r\nquestion. Asher is a most lovable fellow and loyal to the core. It\r\nwould break my heart to have him go. I got into my fight with\r\nHearst over Asher. His people demanded that I should fire Asher,\r\nand I refused to do it.\r\n\r\nI guess you are beaten on Roosevelt, old man. The word that we get\r\nhere is that he is done for at Chicago. Of course before this gets\r\nto you the nomination will be made. My own thought has been that\r\nhe laid too much stress on the support of big business. To have\r\nGary, and Armour, and Perkins as your chief boomers doesn't make\r\nyou very popular in Kansas and Iowa. Hughes may be the easiest man\r\nto beat, after all, because he vetoed the Income tax amendment in\r\nNew York, a two-cent fare bill, and other things which are pretty\r\npopular. He is a good man, honest and fine, but not a liberal. The\r\nwhole Congressional push has been for Hughes for months, but I\r\nhaven't believed that he would accept the nomination. I made the\r\nprophesy to some newspaper men the other day that Roosevelt would\r\nget in and endorse Hughes with both fists. They were inclined to\r\ndoubt this, but I still believe that I am right. ...\r\n\r\nTo-day, comes word that Kitchener has been drowned and Yuan Shi\r\nKai poisoned. Heaven knows whose turn comes next. Just think of\r\nthree such events within a week as that sea battle off Denmark,\r\nthe greatest naval battle of the world; the torpedoing of the\r\nSecretary of War and all of his staff; and the poisoning of the\r\nEmperor of China. I doubt if there ever was a period in the whole\r\nhistory of the world when things moved as fast and there was as\r\nmuch that was exciting. Of course now we have it all thrown onto a\r\nscreen in front of our faces, whereas a hundred years ago we would\r\nhave had to wait for perhaps a year before knowing that the\r\nEmperor of China had been killed. Nevertheless I think there is\r\nmore passion and violence on exhibition to-day than at any time in\r\na great many years.\r\n\r\nI had a talk with the President the other day which was very\r\ntouching. He made reference to the infamous stories that are being\r\ncirculated regarding him with such indignation and pathos that I\r\nfelt really very sorry for him. I suppose that these stories will\r\nbe believed by some and made the basis of a very nasty kind of\r\ncampaign. But there is no truth in them and yet a man can't deny\r\nthem. It is a strange thing that when a man is not liable to any\r\nother charge they trump up some story about a woman. ...\r\n\r\nNow my dear boy, may you have a continuance of courage, for there\r\nis no telling what day the tide may turn and things swing your\r\nway. We know so damned little about nature yet. Affectionately\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HON. WOODROW WILSON\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\nWashington, June 8, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--I see by the papers that it is repeatedly\r\nannounced that you are writing the platform. Now I want to take\r\nthe liberty of saying that this is not altogether good news to me.\r\nOur platform should contain such an appreciation of you and your\r\nadministration, that you could not write it, much less have it\r\nknown that you have written it. It should be one long joyful shout\r\nof exultation over the achievements of the Administration, and I\r\ncan't quite see you leading the shout.\r\n\r\nThe Republican party was for half a century a constructive party,\r\nand the Democratic party was the party of negation and complaint.\r\nWe have taken the play from them. The Democratic party has become\r\nthe party of construction. You have outlined new policies and put\r\nthem into effect through every department, from State to Labor.\r\nTherefore, our platform should be generously filled with words of\r\nboasting that will hearten and make proud the Democrats of the\r\ncountry; a plain tale of large things simply done.\r\n\r\nIf there is any truth at all in the newspaper statement and any\r\npurpose in making it, perhaps the end that is desired might be\r\nreached by a statement that you are not undertaking to write the\r\nplatform, but that at the request of some of the leaders you are\r\ngiving them a concrete statement of your foreign policy.\r\nFaithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. FRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nESSEX ON CHAMPLAIN, N. Y.\r\n\r\nWashington, June 22, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ANNE,--I am just back this minute from Brown [University]\r\nwhere I had a right good time. I arrived in the morning early and\r\nkept the Dean waiting for me for a half an hour. ...\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast I went over to the University grounds, which are\r\nvery quaint, on the crest of a hill with fine old buildings, and\r\nthere found that Hughes was the hero of the day, of course; every\r\nstep he took he was cheered. He was very genial about it. We\r\nmarched in our robes, down through the winding streets of this old\r\nNew England town to a meeting house one hundred and seventy-five\r\nyears old, and there we sat in pews, while the President of Brown,\r\nMr. Faunce, gave the degrees in Latin. I have not heard so much\r\nLatin since I left school. There were a pretty good looking lot of\r\nboys, about half of them New Englanders and about half of them\r\nWesterners. We heard some orations by the students and then\r\nmarched up the hill again where we had lunch, and then went over\r\nto a great tent on the campus where William Roscoe Thayer--who\r\nwrote the life of Hay--President Faunce, Judge Brown, Mr. Hughes,\r\nand I spoke.\r\n\r\nI spoke for about half an hour. My speech fitted in very well,\r\nbecause Thayer preceded me, and he spoke of the lack of an\r\nAmerican spirit; I had already prepared a speech upon the\r\nabundance of American spirit, [Footnote: Speech published in book\r\nentitled, The American Spirit.] so that I answered Thayer, and\r\nanswered him with scorn. I told him that if New England was\r\ngrowing weak in her American pride or her vigor that we would take\r\nthese boys and carry them out West where there was not any lack of\r\nvirility or hardiness or red blood, and that if they wanted to\r\nknow whether the American was willing to fight or not, to go to\r\nany recruiting office of the United States to-day and see how\r\ncrowded it was. I told them about our pioneers, who were taking up\r\nten or twelve million acres of land, the men who had gone to\r\nAlaska, and then turned upon the real proposition which was that\r\nthere was a difference between national spirit and martial spirit.\r\n\r\nWar used to be the only opportunity for glory or romance or\r\nachievement, while there are a million other opportunities now\r\nopen, because man's imagination has grown. In the morning the\r\nCollege had given honorary degrees of LL.D. to Brand Whitlock and\r\nHerbert Hoover. So when I came to the close of my talk I told them\r\nabout Hoover's Belgian work, and that Brand Whitlock had refused\r\nto leave Brussels; and while there was no English and no French\r\nand no Italian and no Spanish and no other flag in Brussels, the\r\nStars and Stripes in front of the American Legation had never come\r\ndown, and the Belgian peasant when he went to his work in the\r\nmorning took his hat off in honor of our flag, and I asked those\r\npeople to stand with me in front of that peasant to take their\r\nhats off and take heart.\r\n\r\nWell, I had the crowd with me right along. Then Hughes came and he\r\ntook American Spirit as his text, and he made it quite evident\r\nwhat his campaign is going to be; that it is going to be a charge,\r\nveiled and very poorly supported by facts, that we have not known\r\nwhere we were going, that we were vacillating, that we did not\r\nhave any enthusiasm, that we did not arouse the people and make\r\nthem feel proud that they were Americans. How in the mischief he\r\nis going to get away with this, I do not understand. Whom were we\r\nto be mad at--England, or Germany, or everybody in the world? Were\r\nwe to war with the entire outfit? He seems to be able to have\r\nsatisfied the Providence Journal, which is run by an Australian\r\nwho has been running the spy system for the British Embassy, and\r\nhas been printing a lot ... about Germany and all the German\r\npress. If he can get away with this he is some politician. I see\r\nthat Teddy has had an understanding with him. Von Meyer was there\r\nyesterday to hold a conference with him.\r\n\r\nBut I do not think that we lost anything in the discussion of\r\nyesterday. There were not any Democrats there who were not on\r\ntheir toes at the end of the meeting; but, of course, practically\r\neverybody in Rhode Island is a Republican. It is the closest thing\r\nto a proprietary estate that I have ever seen.\r\n\r\n... I left at 6 o'clock and on my way back met President Vincent,\r\nof Minneapolis, and George Foster Peabody. You knew that Frank\r\nKellogg was nominated, [Footnote: For the United States Senate.]\r\ndidn't you, Clapp running third? ...\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. ADOLPH MILLER\r\n\r\nWashington, July 4, 1916\r\n\r\n... I see you with blooming cheeks and star-lit eyes peeping out\r\nfrom under a sun-bonnet, enshrined in all the glories of the\r\nmountain redwoods, and I long to be with you if only to get some\r\nof the freshness and joy of the California mountains into my\r\nrather desolate soul.\r\n\r\nHow is the old clam? Do his lips come together in that precise\r\nPrussian way, and does he order the universe about? Or does a new\r\nspirit come over him when he gets with nature? Is she a soothing\r\nmistress who smooths his stiff hair with her soft hand, and pats\r\nhis cheek and nestles him in her arms, and with her cool breath\r\nmakes him forget a federal, or any other kind, of reserve?\r\n\r\nWhy has nature been so unkind to me as to make me a lover but\r\nalways from afar, never to come near her, never to compel me to a\r\nsweet surrender, never to give me peace and contentment, never to\r\nso surround me as to keep out the world of fools and follies and\r\npharisees?\r\n\r\nYou know, I would like to write some servant girl novels. I\r\nbelieve I could do it. My love-making would either be rather tame\r\nand stiff or too intensely early Victorian. But I should like to\r\nswing off into an ecstasy of large turgid words and let my mind\r\nhear the mushy housemaid cry, \"Isn't that just too sweet!\" ...\r\n\r\nI enclose a copy of my speech made at Brown University. Perhaps it\r\nwill interest that old farmer potato bug. He does not deserve to\r\nhave it said, but I miss him very much. Please obey him an you\r\nlove me. Cut out all social activities, giving yourself up to the\r\nacquisition of a few more of the right kind of corpuscles in your\r\ntoo-blue blood. As always, yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Franklin K. Lane\r\n\r\nEssex-on-Champlain\r\n\r\nWashington, July 4, 1916\r\n\r\n... There is no news that I can give you. The weather is very\r\nwarm. Politics is growing warmer. I think Heney will run for\r\nSenator in California, probably against Hiram Johnson. Will\r\nCrocker is also said to be a candidate for the Republican\r\nnomination. I could get the nomination by saying that I would\r\naccept. Phelan told me yesterday that he would see that all the\r\nnecessary money was raised,--that I could win in a walk.\r\nDockweiler says the same thing. The latter is here and we have\r\nseen much of each other. What do you say if I run for Senator? I\r\nreally feel very much tempted to do it at times because things\r\nhave been made so uncomfortable by some of my fool colleagues who\r\nhave butted in on my affairs; and then I feel I would like the\r\nexcitement of the stump and to make the personal appeal once more.\r\nYou could go round with me over the State in an automobile. While\r\nI would not insist upon your making speeches for me, I know that\r\nyour presence would add greatly to my success.\r\n\r\nThere is no telling what way this campaign may go. It may be a\r\nlandslide for Wilson, it may be a landslide the other way. We have\r\nthe hazards because we have the decision of questions. There is\r\nbound to be a lot of objection to whatever course we take with\r\nregard to Mexico. I fear from what Benjamin Ide Wheeler told me\r\nthe other day that Germany any day may decide to put her\r\nsubmarines into active service again on the old lines, especially\r\nif things on land go as they have been going lately against the\r\nTeutons.\r\n\r\n... I shall not decide in favor of accepting the nomination until\r\nI hear from you. In the meantime don't lose any sleep over it. And\r\nso my Nancy has a beau? Well, the little rascal must be given some\r\ngood advice now. So I shall turn my attention to her ...\r\n\r\nF.K.L.\r\n\r\nWashington, July 24, 1916\r\n\r\n... To-day I have spent most quietly,--had Bill Wheeler up for\r\nbreakfast and then went to the Cosmos Club for lunch with\r\nDockweiler. He is very anxious to get a Catholic on the Mexican\r\nCommission and so am I. I want Chief Justice White, but I fear the\r\nPresident won't ask him ...\r\n\r\nDear old Dockweiler is an awfully good man ... From youth he has\r\ngauged every act by his conception of the will of God, and in\r\ndoubt has asked God's representative, the priest. What a\r\ncomforting thing to have a church like that; it makes for\r\nhappiness, if it does not make for progress. Why is it that\r\nprogress must come from discontent? The latter is the divine spark\r\nin man, no doubt,\r\n\r\n    \"O to be satisfied, satisfied,\r\n    Only to lie at Thy feet.\"\r\n\r\nis a hymn we used to sing in church. We yearn to be satisfied and\r\nyet we know because we are not satisfied we grow . ...\r\n\r\n\"The mystical hanker after something higher,\" is religion, and yet\r\nit should not be all of religion; for man's own sake there should\r\nbe some cross to which one can cling, some Christ who can hear and\r\ngive peace to the waves. I wish I could be a Catholic, and yet I\r\ncan not feel that once you have a free spirit that it is right to\r\ngo back into the monastery, and shut yourself up away from doubts,\r\nmaking your soul strong only through prayer. There are two\r\nprinciples in the world fighting all the time, and the one makes\r\nthe other possible. There is no \"perfect,\" there is a \"better\"\r\nonly. And in this fight one does not become better by prayer--\r\nprayer is only the ammunition wagon, the supply train, where one\r\ncan get masks for poison gas and cartridges for the guns.\r\n\r\nPfeiffer said a good thing the other day, quite like him to say\r\nit, too. We were talking of churches and he said he never went to\r\none because he did not believe in abasing or prostrating himself\r\nbefore God, he saw no sense in it; God didn't respect one for it,\r\nand moreover he was part of God himself and he couldn't prostrate\r\nhimself before himself. I asked him if he didn't recognize\r\nhumility as a virtue, and he said, \"No, the higher you hold your\r\nhead the more God-like you are.\"\r\n\r\nHumility, to me, seems to be the basis of sympathy. We stoop to\r\nconquer in that we are not self-assertive and self-assured, for if\r\nwe \"know\" that we are right we can not know how others think or\r\nfeel. We can not grow.\r\n\r\nYou know there are two great classes of people, those who are\r\nchallenged by what they see, and those who are not. Now the only\r\nkind who grow are the former. But what is it to grow? If we\r\n\"evermore come out by that same door wherein we went\" surely there\r\nis no object in being curious. Can there be growth when we are in\r\nan endless circle? ...\r\n\r\nNow after all my struggle, I fall back not on reason but on\r\ninstinct, on a primal desire, and perhaps this is my rudimentary\r\nsoul, the mystical hanker after something higher. That is a real\r\nthing. The purpose of nature seems to be to put it into me and\r\nmake it very important to me. That being so I can not overlook it,\r\nand must obey it. The thing that pleases me as I look back upon\r\nit, is the thing I must do; that sets the standard for me; that is\r\nmorals and religion. If there is any chap who the day after sings\r\nwith joy over being a devil--that man I never heard of--but if he\r\ntakes delight in what he did that was fiendish, then he must\r\nfollow and should follow that bent until he SEES that it is\r\nfiendish. He has to have more light. But I really don't believe\r\nthere is any such fellow, who clearly sees what he did and\r\nrejoices in it. All of us sing, \"I want to be an angel.\" THERE is\r\nthe whole of revelation, and all things that tend to make us\r\ngratify that desire are good. I guess that is pragmatism, in words\r\nof one syllable.\r\n\r\nYou see that all religion comes from a desire to know something\r\ndefinite. We prayed logically, in the old time, to the devil and\r\ntried to propitiate him, so that harm would not come to us. That\r\nis stage number one in our climb. Then we find the good spirit and\r\npray to him to whip the devil, which is stage number two. Then we\r\nask the good spirit to give us strength to whip the devil\r\nourselves. That is stage number three. Buddha and Christ come in\r\nthe number three stage, and that is where we are. We may find, as\r\nstage number four, that the good spirit is only a muscle in our\r\nbrain or a fluid in our nerves, which we strengthen, and become\r\nmasters of ourselves--greater, stronger, more clear-sighted--\r\nwithout any OUTSIDE Great Spirit. That we are all things in\r\nourselves, and that we are, in making ourselves, making the God. I\r\nfancy that is Pfeiffer's idea. It is Mezes', I believe. Then comes\r\nin the mystery of transmitting that highly developed spirit. A\r\nwoman of such a super-soul may marry a man of most carnal nature\r\nwhose children are held down to earth and gross things, and her\r\nfine spirit is lost, unless it lives elsewhere. So we come back to\r\nthe question, how is the good preserved? \"Never any bright thing\r\ndies,\" may be true, but if so it means an immortality of the\r\nspirit. This is all confusion and despair. We do not see where we\r\nare going. But we must climb, we must grow, we must do better, for\r\nthe same reason that our bodies must feed. The rest we leave with\r\nall the other mysteries ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 28, 1916\r\n\r\nI am going to dinner ... and before I go alone into a lonesome\r\nclub, I must send a word to you. Not that I have any particular\r\nword to say, for my mind is heavy, nor that you will find in what\r\nI may say anything that will illumine the way, but why should we\r\nnot talk? What! may a friend not call upon a friend in time of\r\nvacancy to listen to his idle babble? O these pestiferous dealers\r\nin facts and these prosy philosophers, the world must have\r\nsurcease from them and wander in the great spaces. To idle\r\ntogether in the sweet fields of the mind--this is companionship,\r\nwhen thoughts come not by bidding, and argument is taboo; to have\r\nthe mind as open as that of a child for all impressions, and speak\r\nas the skylark sings, this is the mood that proves companionship.\r\n\r\nI shall be lonely to-night, going into a modern monastery and\r\ndriving home alone. The world is all people to me. I lean upon\r\nthem. They induce thought and fancy. They give color to my life.\r\nThey keep me from looking inward, where, alas! I never find that\r\nwhich satisfies me. For of all men I am most critical of myself.\r\nOthers when they go to bed or sit by themselves may chuckle over\r\nthings well done; or find satisfaction in the inner life, as\r\nGeorge does; but not so with me. Thrown on myself I am a stranded\r\nbark upon a foreign shore. And this I know is not as it should be.\r\nEach one should learn to stand alone and find in contemplation and\r\nin fancy the rich material with which to fashion some new fabric,\r\nor build more solidly the substance of his soul.\r\n\r\nI like to have you talk, as in your latest letter, of the making\r\nof yourself. It seems so much more possible than that I could do\r\nthe same. But I am a miserable groping creature, cast on a sea of\r\ndoubt, rejecting one spar to grasp another, and crying all the\r\ntime against the storm, for help. I do not know another man who\r\nhas tortured himself so insistently with the problems that are\r\nunsolvable. You are firmer in your grasp, and when you get\r\nsomething you cling to it and push your way like a practical\r\nperson toward the shore, that shore of solid earth which is NOT,\r\nbut by the pushing you realize the illusion, or the reality, of\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nHere I am talking loosely of the greatest things, and perhaps\r\npedantically; well, we agreed to talk, didn't we, of anything and\r\neverything? You have the birds, the lake, the mountains beyond,\r\nthe children next door, and the Fairy all our own, and I have my\r\ndesk to look at and outside brick blocks and the sky. If I ever do\r\nhypnotize myself into any kind of faith, or find contentment in\r\nany one thing, it will be the sky. The reason I like the water is\r\nbecause it is so much like the sky. There is an amplitude in it\r\nthat gives me chance for infinite wanderings. The clouds and the\r\nstars are somehow the most companionable of all things that do not\r\nwalk and talk.\r\n\r\nWell, we have walked a bit together and have come to the edge of\r\nthe field where we look off and see the unending stretch of\r\nprairie and the great dome. ...\r\n\r\nFRANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo William R. Wheeler\r\n\r\nWashington, August 21, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BILL,--Owing to your departure I have been laid up in bed,\r\nill for a week. You left on Thursday and on Friday night I went to\r\nbed ... The doctors don't know what I had, excepting that I had\r\nthings with \"itis\" at the end of them. I have had allopaths,\r\nChristian Scientists, osteopaths, and Dockweilers. The latter has\r\nbeen my nurse at night, his chief service being to keep me\r\ninterested in the variety of his snoring. I really have had one\r\ndamn hell of a time. The whole back and top of my head blew out,\r\nand I expected an eruption of lava to flow down my back. The only\r\nexplanation of it is a combination of air-drafts and a little too\r\nmuch work and worry. I am now somewhat weak, but otherwise in\r\npretty good condition ...\r\n\r\nI have no intention of saying anything in reply to Pinchot. He\r\nwrote me thirty pages to prove that I was a liar, and rather than\r\nread that again I will admit the fact.\r\n\r\nMy regards to the Lady Alice Isabel. As always affectionately\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LAKE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James Harlan\r\n\r\n[August, 1916]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JIM,--I am writing you from my bed where I have been laid\r\nup for a few days with a hard dose of tonsillitis. Don't know what\r\nhappened but the wicked bug got me and I have suffered more than\r\nwas good for my slender soul.\r\n\r\nI am so glad to hear of your Mother's improvement. Bless her noble\r\nheart! I hope she lives a long time to give you the inspiration of\r\nthat beautiful smile.\r\n\r\nThe Mexican business does not hasten as I had hoped. Brandeis'\r\nwithdrawal was a great surprise to us and I can't quite understand\r\nit. Meantime the railroad situation engrosses our attention fully,\r\nand Mexico can wait ...\r\n\r\nHughes' speeches have been a surprise and disappointment to me ...\r\nOne might fancy a candidate for Congress doing no better but not a\r\nman of such record and position. I think your dear old party\r\nrelies upon holding the regular party men out of loyalty and\r\nprotection, and buying enough Democrats and crooks to get the\r\nmajority. But I don't believe it can be done. The Republican\r\norganization is perfect, but the people are not as gullible as\r\nonce they were.\r\n\r\nTell me some more about the Latin-American. How much form should I\r\nput on? Can you warm up to them? How do you get the truth out of\r\nthem? And how do you get them to stay by their word? What are they\r\nsuspicious of, silence or volubility? Do they expect you to ask\r\nfor more than you expect to get? Do they appreciate candor and\r\nfair dealing, or must you be crafty and indirect? If they expect\r\nthe latter I am not the man for the job, but I can be patient and\r\nlisten. My love to the Lady Maud.\r\n\r\nFRANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Hon. Woodrow Wilson\r\n\r\nThe White House\r\n\r\nWashington, August 28, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--I have had talks this morning with three\r\nmen, all of them Democrats, all of them strongly for you under any\r\ncircumstances. None of them are related to railroads or to labor\r\nunions. Two of them have recently been out of this city and\r\nbelieve that they have a knowledge of the feeling of the country.\r\nAll express the same view and I want to tell it to you in case you\r\nwrite a message to Congress.\r\n\r\nThey say that the people do not grasp the meaning of your\r\nstatement that society has made its judgment in favor of an eight-\r\nhour day. This, the people think, is a matter that can be\r\narbitrated. They ask why can't it be arbitrated? They say that the\r\ncountry feels that you have lined yourself up with the labor\r\nunions irrevocably for an eight-hour day, as against the railroads\r\nwho wish to arbitrate the necessity for putting in an eight-hour\r\nday immediately, and irrespective of the additional cost to the\r\nrailroads. They say that the men are attempting to bludgeon the\r\nrailroads into granting their demand which has not been shown to\r\nthe people to be reasonable. This demand is that the men should\r\nhave ten hours pay for eight hours work or less. They say that if\r\nthis question cannot be arbitrated, the railroads must yield on\r\nevery question and that freight rates and passenger rates instead\r\nof going down, as they have for the past twenty years, must\r\ninevitably increasingly go up. They say that the people do not\r\nrealize that you have been willing to entertain any proposition\r\nmade by the railroads, but that you have stood steadfastly for\r\nsomething which the men have demanded.\r\n\r\nNow, all of this indicates a lack of knowledge of what your\r\nposition has been. I am giving you the gist of these conversations\r\nbecause they represent a point of view so that if you desire you\r\nmay meet such criticism.\r\n\r\nYou must remember, Mr. President, that the American people have\r\nnot had for fifty years a President who was not at this period in\r\na campaign bending all of his power to purely personal and\r\npolitical ends. Your ideality and unselfishness are so rare that\r\nthings need to be made particularly clear to them. Faithfully\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of September Lane was appointed Chairman of the\r\nAmerican-Mexican Joint Commission, the other Americans being Judge\r\nGeorge Gray, of Delaware, and John R. Mott, secretary of the Young\r\nMen's Christian Association. The Mexican members were Luis\r\nCabrera, Minister of Finance, Alberto Pani, and Ignatio Bonillas,\r\nafterward Ambassador to Washington.\r\n\r\nIt was the hope of the Administration that this Commission would\r\nlay the foundation for a better understanding between America and\r\nMexico. The Commission started its work in New London, but later\r\nas the hearings dragged on, they went to Atlantic City.\r\n\r\nJust before this Commission was named, Lane wrote to his brother,\r\n\"I have been turned all topsy turvy by the Mexican situation. I\r\nhave suggested to the President the establishment of a commission\r\nto deal with this matter upon a fundamental basis, but Carranza is\r\nobsessed with the idea that he is a real god and not a tin god,\r\nthat he holds thunderbolts in his hands instead of confetti, and\r\nhe won't let us help him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Alexander Vogelsang\r\n\r\nActing Secretary of the Interior American-Mexican Joint Commission\r\n\r\nSeptember 29, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ALECK,--Don't worry about yourself. Don't worry about the\r\noffice. You will be all right, and so will the office. I am not\r\nworrying about you because I haven't got time to. I'll take your\r\njob if you will take mine. The interpreting of a city charter is\r\nnothing to the interpreting of the Mexican mind. Dealing with\r\nCongress is not so difficult as dealing with Mexican statesmen. I\r\nhave had some jobs in my life, but none in which I was put to it\r\nas I am in this. Now I have not only a question as to what to do\r\nin the making of a nation, the development of its opportunity, the\r\neducation of its people, the establishment of its finances, and\r\nthe opening of its industries in the establishment of its\r\nrelations with other countries, but also the problem as to where\r\nthe men can be found that can carry out the program, once it is\r\nmade. If I were only Dictator I could handle the thing, I think,\r\nall right. The hardest part of all is to convince a proud and\r\nobstinate people that they really need any help.\r\n\r\n... Remember me to the noble bunch of fellows who add loyalty to\r\npluck, pluck to capacity. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Frederic J. Lane\r\n\r\nAmerican-Mexican Joint Commission\r\n\r\nSeptember 29, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRITZ,--I sent you a wire the other night just to let you\r\nknow that I was thinking of you. I am now steaming down Long\r\nIsland Sound in the midst of a rainstorm and with fog all around\r\nus, in the Government's boat Sylph. We are on our way to Atlantic\r\nCity where the conference will continue, the hotel at New London\r\nhaving been closed. ...\r\n\r\nIt looks to me at long range as if Johnson would surely carry\r\nCalifornia. Whether Wilson will, or not, is a question. I hope to\r\nGod he may. Whether I shall get an opportunity to get out and\r\nstump for him depends entirely upon this Commission, which is\r\nholding me down hard. We are working from ten in the morning till\r\ntwelve at night, and not making as rapid progress as we should\r\nbecause of the Latin-American temperament. They want to start a\r\ngovernment afresh down there; that is, go upon the theory that\r\nthere never was any government and that they now know how a\r\ngovernment should be formed and the kind of laws there should be,\r\ndisregarding all that is past, and basing their plans upon ideals\r\nwhich sometimes are very impracticable. They distrust us. They\r\nwill not believe that we do not want to take some of their\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\nI despair often, but I take new courage when I think of you, of\r\nthe struggle you are making and the brave way in which you are\r\nmaking it. What a superbly glorious thing it would be if you could\r\nmaster the hellish fiend that has attacked you! ...\r\n\r\nMy best love to you, dear Fritz, affectionately yours, F. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Frank I. Cobb New York World\r\n\r\nAmerican-Mexican Joint Commission Atlantic City, November 11, 1916\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COBB,--My very warm, earnest, and enthusiastic\r\ncongratulations to you. You made the best editorial campaign that\r\nI have ever known to be made. I would give more for the editorial\r\nsupport of the New York World than for that of any two papers that\r\nI know of. The result in California turned, really as the result\r\nin the entire West did, upon the real progressivism of the\r\nprogressives. It was not pique because Johnson was not recognized.\r\nNo man, not Johnson nor Roosevelt, carries the progressives in his\r\npocket. The progressives in the East were Perkins progressives who\r\ncould be delivered. THE WEST THINKS FOR ITSELF. Johnson could not\r\ndeliver California. Johnson made very strong speeches for Hughes.\r\nThe West is really progressive. ...\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the election, there are two things I want you to bear\r\ndistinctly in mind, my dear Mr. Cobb. One is that the states which\r\nthe Interior Department deals with are the states which elected\r\nMr. Wilson. ... And the second is that we kept the Mexican\r\nsituation from blowing up in a most critical part of the campaign,\r\nwhich is also due to the Secretary of the Interior, damn you! In\r\nfact, next to you, I think the Secretary of the Interior is the\r\nmost important part of this whole show! Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo R. M. Fitzgerald American-Mexican Commission\r\n\r\nAtlantic City, November 12, 1916\r\n\r\nDEAR BOB,--I am very glad to get your telegram. I know that it\r\ntook work, judgment, and finesse to bring about the result that\r\nwas obtained in California. What a splendid thing it is to have\r\nour state the pivotal state! The eastern papers are attempting to\r\nmake it appear that the state turned toward Wilson because of the\r\nslight put upon Johnson by Hughes. These people in the East are\r\nnot large enough to understand that the people think for\r\nthemselves out West, and are not governed by little personalities,\r\nthat we don't play \"Follow the leader,\" as they do here. The real\r\nfact is that Roosevelt undertook to deliver the progressives and\r\ncould not do it in the West. Now we must hold all these forward-\r\nlooking people in line with us and make the Democratic party\r\nrealize the dream that you and I had of it when we were boys,\r\nthirty years ago, and took part in our first campaign. There is\r\nroom for only two parties in the United States, the liberal and\r\nthe conservative, and ours must be the liberal party. Cordially\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFranklin K. Lane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James K. Moffitt\r\n\r\nAtlantic City, November 12, 1916\r\n\r\nMy dear Jim,--It was fine of you to send me that telegram, and I\r\nam not too modest to \"allow\" as Artemus Ward used to say, as how\r\nthe Interior Department is rather stuck up over the result. The\r\nDepartment certainly had not been very popular in the West. ...\r\nAll of us will be taken a bit more seriously now, I guess. I wired\r\nCushing and the others who led in the fight and I am going to\r\nwrite a note to Benjamin Ide Wheeler, who from the first, be it\r\nsaid to his credit, claimed California for Wilson. Wheeler is\r\ncertainly a thoroughbred. I wish I could get your way soon and see\r\nyou all, and rejoice with you.\r\n\r\nI have just received a telegram from Bryan, reading:--\r\n\r\n\"Shake. Many thanks. It was great. The West, a stone which the\r\nbuilders rejected, has become the head of the corner.\" Cordially\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFranklin K. Lane\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Benjamin Ide Wheeler\r\n\r\nAtlantic City, November 14,1916\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Wheeler,--I know that you rejoice with all of us. You\r\nwere the first man to tell me that Wilson would carry California,\r\nand I never believed it as truly as you did, but I have taken many\r\noccasions lately to say that you were a true prophet. And speaking\r\nof prophets, what a lot have been unmade! Did you see that I\r\nwanted to bet a hat with George Harvey that he could not name four\r\nstates west of the Alleghenies that would go for Hughes? The truth\r\nabout the thing, as I see it, is that you can't deliver the\r\nWestern man and you can't deliver the true progressive, anyhow.\r\nThe people of the East are in a far more feudal state than the\r\npeople of the West. Here they live by sufferance, by favor; they\r\nare helpless if they lose their jobs. Out there hope is high in\r\ntheir hearts and they feel that there is a fair world around them,\r\nin which they have another chance. The resentment was strong\r\nagainst Roosevelt undertaking to turn over his vote. Of course I\r\nam glad of Johnson's election, as he is a strong, stalwart chap,\r\ncapable of tremendous things for good. He will probably be a\r\npresidential candidate four years from now, and I see no man now\r\nwho can beat him, nor should he be beaten unless we have a good\r\ndeal better material than our run of ... rank opportunists.\r\n\r\nI am working on a treadmill here. Perhaps by the time you come on\r\nin December I will be able to report something accomplished. But\r\noh! the misery of dealing with people who are eternally suspicious\r\nand have no sense of good faith!\r\n\r\nWe went with the Millers to the James Roosevelt place up at Hyde\r\nPark on the Hudson, just before election, and had an exquisite\r\ntime. I put in four or five days campaigning, and this was the end\r\nof my trip. My speeches were all made in New York where I thought\r\nthey might count, but the organizations were too perfect for us.\r\n\r\nPresident Wilson will leave a mere shadow of a party, unless he\r\ntakes an interest in reorganizing it. He has drawn a lot of young\r\nmen to him who should be tied together, as we were in the early\r\nCleveland days. Of course, we must have a cause, not merely a\r\nslogan.\r\n\r\nMrs., Lane is here while I am writing this and she sends her love\r\nto both you and your wife, as do I. As always, cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Roland Cotton Smith\r\n\r\nSunday, [January 7? 1917]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DR. SMITH,--I know that you are human enough to like\r\nappreciation and so I am sending you this word,--no more than I\r\nfeel!\r\n\r\nYour address of this morning was a bit of real literature. It\r\nproduced the effect you desired without making a bid for it. It\r\nwas as subtle and full of suggestion as Jusserand's book on France\r\nand the United States. You gave an atmosphere to the old building\r\nas an institution, which made every one of us feel something more\r\nof ennobling standards and traditions. You touched emotion. Many\r\nan old chap there felt called upon suddenly and apologetically to\r\nblow his nose. And the crowning bit of fine sentiment was asking\r\nus all to rise, as you read the list of the distinguished ones who\r\nhad worshipped there. You have the art of making men better by not\r\npreaching to them. So here is my hand in admiration and in\r\ngratitude. Sincerely,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James H. Barry San Francisco Star\r\n\r\nWashington, [January 9, 1917]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JIM,--That card of yours spoke to me so directly and\r\nwarmly from the heart, that it revived in my memory all the long\r\nyears of our friendship, and made me feel that the world had been\r\ngood to me beyond most men, in that it had brought a \"few friends\r\nand their affection tried.\" These are to be trying years--these\r\nnext four--and it will take courage and rare good sense to keep\r\nthis old ship on her true path. You have a part and so have I. We\r\ntake our turn at the wheel. May God give us strength and\r\nsteadiness!\r\n\r\nPlease give my greetings to your fine boys, and to all the old\r\ngroup that are still with you, and know that always I hold you in\r\ndeep affection. Sincerely,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nCABINET TALK AND WAR PLANS\r\n\r\n1917\r\n\r\nCabinet Meetings--National Council of Defense--Bernstorff--War--\r\nPlan for Railroad Consolidation--U-Boat Sinkings Revealed--Alaska\r\n\r\nTo George W. Lane\r\n\r\nWashington, February 9,1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--I am going to write you in confidence some of the\r\ntalks we have at the Cabinet and you may keep these letters in\r\ncase I ever wish to remind myself of what transpired. A week ago\r\nyesterday, (February 1st), the word came that Germany was to turn\r\n\"mad dog\" again, and sink all ships going within her war zone.\r\nThis was the question, of course, taken up at the meeting of the\r\nCabinet on February 2nd. The President opened by saying that this\r\nnotice was an \"astounding surprise.\" He had received no intimation\r\nof such a reversal of policy. Indeed, Zimmermann, the German\r\nMinister of Foreign Affairs, had within ten days told Gerard that\r\nsuch a thing was an \"impossibility.\" At this point Lansing said\r\nthat he had good reason to believe that Bernstorff had the note\r\nfor fully ten days before delivering it, and had held it off\r\nbecause of the President's Peace Message to Congress, which had\r\nmade it seem inadvisable to deliver it then. In answer to a\r\nquestion as to which side he wished to see win, the President said\r\nthat he didn't wish to see either side win,--for both had been\r\nequally indifferent to the rights of neutrals--though Germany had\r\nbeen brutal in taking life, and England only in taking property.\r\nHe would like to see the neutrals unite. I ventured the expression\r\nthat to ask them to do this would be idle, as they could not\r\nafford to join with us if it meant the insistence on their rights\r\nto the point of war. He thought we might coordinate the neutral\r\nforces, but was persuaded that an effort to do this publicly, as\r\nhe proposed, would put some of the small powers in a delicate\r\nposition. We talked the world situation over. I spoke of the\r\nlikelihood of a German-Russian-Japanese alliance as the natural\r\nthing at the end of the war because they all were nearly in the\r\nsame stage of development. He thought the Russian peasant might\r\nsave the world this misfortune. The fact that Russia had been, but\r\na short time since, on the verge of an independent peace with\r\nGermany was brought out as evidencing the possibility of a break\r\non the Allies' side. His conclusion was that nothing should be\r\ndone now,--awaiting the \"overt act\" by Germany, which would take\r\nhim to Congress to ask for power.\r\n\r\nAt the next meeting of the Cabinet on February 6th, the main\r\nquestion discussed was whether we should convoy, or arm, our\r\nmerchant ships. Secretary Baker said that unless we did our ships\r\nwould stay in American ports, and thus Germany would have us\r\neffectively locked up by her threat. The St. Louis, of the\r\nAmerican line, wanted to go out with mail but asked the right to\r\narm and the use of guns and gunners. After a long discussion, the\r\ndecision of the President was that we should not convoy because\r\nthat made a double hazard,--this being the report of the Navy,--\r\nbut that ships should be told that they MIGHT arm, but that\r\nwithout new power from Congress they should not be furnished with\r\nguns and gunners.\r\n\r\nThe President said that he was \"passionately\" determined not to\r\nover-step the slightest punctilio of honor in dealing with\r\nGermany, or interned Germans, or the property of Germans. He would\r\nnot take the interned ships, not even though they were being\r\ngutted of their machinery. He wished an announcement made that all\r\nproperty of Germans would be held inviolate, and that interned\r\nsailors on merchant ships could enter the United States. If we are\r\nto have war we must go in with our hands clean and without any\r\nbasis for criticism against us. The fact that before Bernstorff\r\ngave the note telling of the new warfare, the ships had been\r\ndismantled as to their machinery, was not to move us to any act\r\nthat would look like hostility.\r\n\r\nFebruary 10\r\n\r\nYesterday we talked of the holding of Gerard as a hostage. Lansing\r\nsaid there was no doubt of it. He thought it an act of war in\r\nitself. But did not know on what theory it was done, except that\r\nGermany was doing what she thought we would do. Germany evidently\r\nwas excited over her sailors here, fearing that they would be\r\ninterned, and over her ships, fearing that they would be taken. I\r\nsaid that it seemed to be established that Germany meant to do\r\nwhat she said she would do, and that we might as well act on that\r\nassumption. The President said that he had always believed this,\r\nbut thought that there were chances of her modifying her position,\r\nand that he could do nothing, in good faith toward Congress,\r\nwithout going before that body. He felt that in a few days\r\nsomething would be done that would make this necessary.\r\n\r\nSo there you are up to date--in a scrappy way. Now don't tell what\r\nyou know. Ned is flying at Newport News. He sent me a telegram\r\nsaying that the President could go as far as he liked, \"the bunch\"\r\nwould back him up. Strange how warlike young fellows are,\r\nespecially if they think that they are preparing for some\r\nusefulness in war. That's the militaristic spirit that is bad.\r\nMuch love to you and Frances. Give me good long letters telling me\r\nwhat is in the back of that wise old head.\r\n\r\nF. K.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo George W. Lane\r\n\r\nFebruary 16, [1917]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--That letter and proposed wire were received and\r\nyour spirit is mine--the form of your letter could not be improved\r\nupon--and you are absolutely sound as to policy.\r\n\r\nAt the last meeting of the Cabinet, we again urged that we should\r\nconvoy our own ships, but the President said that this was not\r\npossible without going to Congress, and he was not ready to do\r\nthat now. The Navy people say that to convoy would be foolish\r\nbecause it would make a double target, but it seems to me the\r\nright thing to risk a naval ship in the enforcement of our right.\r\n\r\nAt our dinner to the President last night he said he was not in\r\nsympathy with any great preparedness--that Europe would be man and\r\nmoney poor by the end of the war. I think he is dead wrong in\r\nthis, and as I am a member of the National Council of Defense, I\r\nam pushing for everything possible. This week we have had a\r\nmeeting of the Council every day--the Secretary of War, Navy,\r\nInterior, Commerce, and Labor--with an Advisory Commission\r\nconsisting of seven business men. We are developing a plan for the\r\nmobilization of all our national industries and resources so that\r\nwe may be ready for getting guns, munitions, trucks, supplies,\r\nairplanes, and other material things as soon as war comes--IF NOT\r\nTOO SOON. It is a great organization of industry and resources. I\r\nthink that I shall urge Hoover as the head of the work. His\r\nBelgian experience has made him the most competent man in this\r\ncountry for such work. He has promised to come to me as one of my\r\nassistants but the other work is the larger, and I can get on with\r\na smaller man. He will correlate the industrial life of the nation\r\nagainst the day of danger and immediate need. France seems to be\r\nahead in this work. The essentials are to commandeer all material\r\nresources of certain kinds (steel, copper, rubber, nickel, etc.);\r\nthen have ready all drawings, machines, etc., necessary in advance\r\nfor all munitions and supplies; and know the plant that can\r\nproduce these on a standard basis.\r\n\r\nThe Army and Navy are so set and stereotyped and stand-pat that I\r\nam almost hopeless as to moving them to do the wise, large,\r\nwholesale job. They are governed by red-tape,--worse than any\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nThe Chief of Staff fell asleep at our meeting to-day--Mars and\r\nMorpheus in one!\r\n\r\nTo-day's meeting has resulted in nothing, though in Mexico, Cuba,\r\nCosta Rica, and Europe we have trouble. The country is growing\r\ntired of delay, and without positive leadership is losing its\r\nkeenness of conscience and becoming inured to insult. Our\r\nAmbassador in Berlin is held as a hostage for days--our Consuls'\r\nwives are stripped naked at the border, our ships are sunk, our\r\npeople killed--and yet we wait and wait! What for I do not know.\r\nGermany is winning by her bluff, for she has our ships interned in\r\nour own harbors.\r\n\r\nWell, dear boy, I'm not a pacifist as you see. Much love,\r\n\r\nFRANK\r\n\r\nTo George W. Lane\r\n\r\nWashington, February 20, [1917]\r\n\r\nDEAR GEORGE,--Another Cabinet meeting and no light yet on what our\r\npolicy will be as to Germany. We evidently are waiting for the\r\n\"overt act,\" which I think Germany will not commit. We are all,\r\nwith the exception of one or two pro-Germans, feeling humiliated\r\nby the situation, but nothing can be done.\r\n\r\nMcAdoo brought up the matter of shipping being held in our ports.\r\nIt appears that something more than half of the normal number of\r\nships has gone out since February 1st, and they all seem to be\r\ngetting over the first scare, because Germany is not doing more\r\nthan her former amount of damage.\r\n\r\nWe were told of intercepted cables to the Wolfe News Agency, in\r\nBerlin, in which the American people were represented as being\r\nagainst war under any circumstances--sympathizing strongly with a\r\nneutrality that would keep all Americans off the seas. Thus does\r\nthe Kaiser learn of American sentiment! No wonder he sizes us up\r\nas cowards! ...\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Frank I. Cobb\r\n\r\nWashington, February 21, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COBB,--I have told Henry Hall that he should come down\r\nhere and give the story of how Bernstorff handled the newspaper\r\nmen, and thus worked the American people, ... He ought to get out\r\nof the newspaper men themselves, and he can, the whole atmosphere\r\nof the Washington situation since Dernberg left,--Bernstorff's\r\nlittle knot of society friends, chiefly women, the dinners that\r\nthey had, his appeals for sympathy, the manner in which he would\r\noffset whatever the State Department was attempting to get before\r\nthe American people. He would give away to newspaper men news that\r\nhe got from his own government before it got to the State\r\nDepartment. He would give away also the news that he got from the\r\nState Department before the State Department itself gave it out,\r\nand he had a regular room in which he received these newspaper\r\nmen, and handed them cigars and so on, and carried on a propaganda\r\nagainst the policy of the United States while acting as Ambassador\r\nfor Germany, the like of which nobody has carried on since Genet;\r\nand worse than his, because it was carried on secretly and\r\ncunningly. ...\r\n\r\nHall will be able to get a ripping good story, I am satisfied,--a\r\ngood two pages on \"Modern Diplomacy,\" which will reveal how long-\r\nsuffering the United States has been. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo George W. Lane\r\n\r\nWashington, February 25, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--On Friday we had one of the most animated\r\nsessions of the Cabinet that I suppose has ever been held under\r\nthis or any other President. It all arose out of a very innocent\r\nquestion of mine as to whether it was true that the wives of\r\nAmerican Consuls on leaving Germany had been stripped naked, given\r\nan acid bath to detect writing on their flesh, and subjected to\r\nother indignities. Lansing answered that it was true. Then I asked\r\nHouston about the bread riots in New York, as to whether there was\r\nshortage of food because of car shortage due to vessels not going\r\nout with exports. This led to a discussion of the great problem\r\nwhich we all had been afraid to raise--Why shouldn't we send our\r\nships out with guns or convoys? Daniels said we must not convoy--\r\nthat would be dangerous. (Think of a Secretary of the Navy talking\r\nof danger!) The President said that the country was not willing\r\nthat we should take any risks of war. I said that I got no such\r\nsentiment out of the country, but if the country knew that our\r\nConsuls' wives had been treated so outrageously that there would\r\nbe no question as to the sentiment. This, the President took as a\r\nsuggestion that we should work up a propaganda of hatred against\r\nGermany. Of course, I said I had no such idea, but that I felt\r\nthat in a Democracy the people were entitled to know the facts.\r\nMcAdoo, Houston, and Redfield joined me. The President turned on\r\nthem bitterly, especially on McAdoo, and reproached all of us with\r\nappealing to the spirit of the Code Duello. We couldn't get the\r\nidea out of his head that we were bent on pushing the country into\r\nwar. Houston talked of resigning after the meeting. McAdoo will--\r\nwithin a year, I believe. I tried to smooth them down by recalling\r\nour past experiences with the President. We have had to push, and\r\npush, and push, to get him to take any forward step--the Trade\r\nCommission, the Tariff Commission. He comes out right but he is\r\nslower than a glacier--and things are mighty disagreeable,\r\nwhenever anything has to be done.\r\n\r\nNow he is being abused by the Republicans for being slow, and this\r\nwill probably help a bit, though it may make him more obstinate.\r\nHe wants no extra session, and the Republicans fear that he will\r\nsubmit to anything in the way of indignity or national humiliation\r\nwithout \"getting back,\" so they are standing for an extra session.\r\nThe President believes, I think, that the munitions makers are\r\nback of the Republican plan. But I doubt this. They simply want to\r\nhave a \"say\"; and the President wants to be alone and unbothered.\r\nHe probably would not call Cabinet meetings if Congress adjourned.\r\nThen I would go to Honolulu, where the land problem vexes.\r\n\r\nI don't know whether the President is an internationalist or a\r\npacifist, he seems to be very mildly national--his patriotism is\r\ncovered over with a film of philosophic humanitarianism, that\r\ncertainly doesn't make for \"punch\" at such a time as this.\r\n\r\nMy love to you old man,--do write me oftener and tell me if you\r\nget all my letters.\r\n\r\nF. K L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo George W. Lane\r\n\r\nWashington, March 6, [1917]\r\n\r\nWell my dear George, the new administration is launched--smoothly\r\nbut not on a smooth sea. The old Congress went out in disgrace,\r\ntalking to death a bill to enable the President to protect\r\nAmericans on the seas. The reactionaries and the progressives\r\ncombined--Penrose and La Follette joined hands to stop all\r\nlegislation, so that the government is without money to carry on\r\nits work.\r\n\r\nIt is unjust to charge the whole thing on the La Follette group;\r\nthey served to do the trick which the whole Republican machine\r\nwished done. For the Penrose, Lodge people would not let any bills\r\nthrough and were glad to get La Follette's help. The Democrats\r\nfought and died--because there was no \"previous question\" in the\r\nSenate rules.\r\n\r\nThe weather changed for inauguration--Wilson luck--and the event\r\nwent off without accident. To-day, we had expected a meeting of\r\nthe Cabinet to determine what we should do in the absence of\r\nlegislation, but that has gone over,--I expect to give the\r\nAttorney General a chance to draft an opinion on the armed ship\r\nmatter. I am for prompt action--putting the guns on the ships and\r\nconvoying, if necessary. Much love.\r\n\r\nK.F.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Edward J. Wheeler Current Opinion\r\n\r\nWashington, March 15, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MY. WHEELER,--I wish that I could be with you to honor Mr.\r\nHowells. But who are we, to honor him? Is he not an institution?\r\nIs he not the Master? Has he not taught for half a century that\r\nthis new and peculiar man, the American, is worth drawing? Why,\r\nfor an American not to take off his hat to Howells would be to\r\nfail in appreciation of one's self as an object of art--an\r\nunlikely, belittling, and soul-destroying sin.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether Howells is a great photographer or a great\r\nartist; but this I do know, that I like him because he sees\r\nthrough his own eyes, and I like his eyes. If that be treason,\r\nmake the most of it. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo George W. Lane\r\n\r\nWashington, April 1, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--I took your letter and your proposed wire as to\r\nour going into war and sent them to the President as suggestions\r\nfor his proposed message which in a couple of days will come out--\r\nwhat it is to be I don't know--excepting in spirit. He is to be\r\nfor recognizing war and taking hold of the situation in such a\r\nfashion as will eventually lead to an Allies' victory over\r\nGermany. But he goes unwillingly. The Cabinet is at last a unit.\r\nWe can stand Germany's insolence and murderous policy no longer.\r\nBurleson, Gregory, Daniels, and Wilson were the last to come over.\r\n\r\nThe meetings of the Cabinet lately have been nothing less than\r\ncouncils of war. The die is cast--and yet no one has seen the\r\nmessage. The President hasn't shown us a line. He seems to think\r\nthat in war the Pacific Coast will not be strongly with him. They\r\ndon't want war to be sure--no one does. But they will not suffer\r\nfurther humiliation. I sent West for some telegrams telling of the\r\nlocal feeling in different States and all said, \"Do as the\r\nPresident says.\" Yet none came back that spoke as if they felt\r\nthat we had been outraged or that it was necessary for humanity\r\nthat Germany be brought to a Democracy. There is little pride or\r\nsense of national dignity in most of our politicians.\r\n\r\nThe Council of National Defense is getting ready. I yesterday\r\nproposed a resolution, which was adopted, that our contracts for\r\nships, ammunition, and supplies be made upon the basis of a three\r\nyears' program. We may win in two years. If we had the nerve to\r\nraise five million men at once we could end it in six months,\r\n\r\nThe first thing is to let Russia and France have money. And the\r\nsecond thing, to see that Russia has munitions, of which they are\r\nshort--depending largely, too largely, upon Japan. I shouldn't be\r\nsurprised if we would operate the Russian railroads. And ships,\r\nships! How we do need ships, and there are none in the world.\r\nShips to feed England and to make the Russian machine work.\r\nHindenburg is to turn next toward Petrograd--he is only three\r\nhundred miles away now. I fear he will succeed. But that does not\r\nmean the conquest of Russia! The lovable, kindly Russians are not\r\nto be conquered,--and it makes me rejoice that we are to be with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAll sides need aeroplanes--for the war that is perhaps the\r\ngreatest of all needs; and there Germany is strongest. Ned will go\r\namong the first. He is flying alone now and is enjoying the risk,\r\n--the consciousness of his own skill. Anne is very brave about it.\r\n\r\nThis is the program as far as we have gone: Navy, to make a line\r\nacross the sea and hunt submarines; Army, one million at once, and\r\nas many more as necessary as soon as they can be got ready.\r\nFinanced by income taxes largely. Men and capital both drafted.\r\n\r\nI'm deep in the work. Have just appointed a War-Secretary of my\r\nown--an ex-Congressman named Lathrop Brown from New York, who is to\r\nsee that we get mines, etc., at work. I wish you were here but the\r\nweather would be too much for you, I fear. Very hot right now!\r\n\r\nSometime I'll tell you how we stopped the strike. It was a big\r\npiece of work that was blanketed by the Supreme Court's decision\r\nnext day. But we came near to having something akin to Civil War.\r\nMuch love, my dear boy.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nGrosvenor Clarkson, Director of the Council of National Defense,\r\nin recording the activities of that body says:--\r\n\r\n\"It is, of course, well known that Secretary Lane, as a member of\r\nthe Council of National Defense, played a dramatic and successful\r\npart in the settlement of the threatened great railroad strike of\r\nMarch, 1917. By resolution of the Council of National Defense of\r\nMarch 16, 1917, Secretary Lane and Secretary of Labor Wilson, as\r\nmembers of the Council, and Daniel Willard, President of the\r\nBaltimore and Ohio Railroad, and Samuel Gompers of the Advisory\r\nCommission, were designated to represent the government, at the\r\nmeeting in New York with the representatives of the railroad\r\nbrotherhoods and railroad executives--the meeting that stopped the\r\nstrike.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRANK I. COBB NEW YORK WORLD\r\n\r\nWashington, April 13, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRANK,--I have your note and am thoroughly in sympathy\r\nwith it. The great need of France at this moment is to get ships\r\nto carry the supplies across the water. It is a secret, but a\r\nfact, that France has 600,000 tons of freight in New York and\r\nother harbors waiting to ship. I am in favor of taking all the\r\nGerman ships under requisition, paying for their use eventually,\r\nbut this is a matter of months. Immediately, I think we should\r\ntake all the coastwise ships, or the larger portion of them. The\r\nNavy colliers and Army transports can be put into the business of\r\ncarrying supplies to France.\r\n\r\nWe are to have a meeting of the Council of National Defense to-day,\r\nand I am going to take this matter up. I have been pushing on\r\nit for several weeks. As to the purchasing of supplies, I think we\r\nought to protect the Allies, especially Russia, but, of course, we\r\ncannot touch their present contracts. ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, April 15, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--I enclose a couple of confidential papers that\r\nwill interest you. The situation is not as happy in Russia as it\r\nshould be. The people are so infatuated with their own internal\r\nreforms that there is danger of their making a separate peace,\r\nwhich would throw the entire strength of Germany on the west\r\nfront, and compel us to go in with millions of men where we had\r\nthought that a few would suffice.\r\n\r\nMy work on the National Council of Defense lately has been dealing\r\nwith many things, chiefly mobilization of our railroads and the\r\nsecuring of new shipping. At my suggestion to Mr. Willard he\r\ncalled together the leading forty-five railroad presidents of the\r\nUnited States, and I addressed them upon the necessity of tying\r\ntogether all of the railroads within one unit and making a single\r\noperating system of the 250,000 miles. They met the proposition\r\nsplendidly and appointed a committee to effect this. It will\r\nrequire some sacrifice on the part of the railroads, and\r\nconsiderable on the part of the shippers; for free time on cars\r\nwill have to be cut down, some passenger trains taken off, and\r\nequipment allowed to flow freely from one system to the other\r\nunder a single direction, no matter who owns the locomotives or\r\nthe cars. I put it up to them as a test of the efficiency of\r\nprivate ownership.\r\n\r\nOn the shipping side we are not only going about the task of\r\nbuilding a thousand wooden ships, under the direction of Denman\r\nand Goethals, but we are going to take our coastwise shipping off,\r\nmaking the railroads carry this freight, and put all available\r\nships into the trans-Atlantic business. We want, also, to get\r\nsome steel ships built. The great trouble with this is the\r\nshortage of plates and the shortage of shipyards. In order to\r\neffect this, I expect we will have to postpone the building of\r\nsome of our large dreadnaughts and battle cruisers, which could\r\nnot be in service for three years anyhow. Whether we will succeed\r\nin getting the Secretary of the Navy to agree to this is a\r\nquestion, but I am going to try.\r\n\r\nWe, of course, are going to press into service at once the German\r\nand Austrian ships, such of them as can be repaired and will be of\r\nuse in the freight business, but we will not confiscate them. We\r\nwill deal with them exactly as we will deal with American ships,\r\npaying at the end of the war whatever their services were worth.\r\nThis spirit of fairness is to animate us throughout the war. Of\r\ncourse enemy warships were seized as prizes of war, but there are\r\nvery few of these, and of no considerable value. I do not believe\r\nthey can be of any use.\r\n\r\nEngland is sending over Mr. Balfour with a very high Commission.\r\nThese gentlemen will arrive here this week, and I expect with them\r\nViviani and Joffre, from France. We will have intimate talks with\r\nthem and gain the benefit of their experience. I expect Mr.\r\nBalfour to make some speeches that will put England in a more\r\nfavorable light, and the presence of Joffre will stimulate\r\nrecruiting in our Army and Navy. He is the one real figure who has\r\ncome out of the war so far.\r\n\r\nWe are raising seven billions; three billions to go to the Allies,\r\nlargely for purchases to be made here. Money contributions pass\r\nunanimously, but there is to be trouble over our war measures\r\nrespecting conscription and the raising of an adequate army. Some\r\npacifists and other pro-Germans are cultivating the idea that none\r\nbut volunteers should be sent to Europe. Some are also saying\r\nGermany can have peace with us if she stops her submarine warfare.\r\nI doubt if that line of agitation will be successful before\r\nCongress. Certainly it will not be successful with the President\r\nor the Cabinet. We are now very happily united upon following\r\nevery course that will lead to the quickest and most complete\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe greatest impending danger is the drive on the east front into\r\nRussia, possibly the taking of Petrograd, and the weakness on the\r\npart of the Russians because of so large a socialistic element now\r\nin control of Russian affairs. We offered Russia a commission of\r\nrailroad men to look over their railroad systems and advise with\r\nthem as to the best means of operating them. At first Russia\r\ninclined to welcome such a commission, but later the offer was\r\ndeclined because of local feeling. We intend to send a commission\r\nourselves to Russia, possibly headed by McAdoo or Root, and on\r\nthis commission we will have a railroad man with expert knowledge\r\nwho can be of some service to them, I hope. The Russian and the\r\nFrench governments have ordered hundreds of locomotives and tens\r\nof thousands of cars in this country, a large part of which are\r\nready for shipment, but which cannot be shipped because of lack of\r\nshipping facilities. Affectionately yours,\r\n\r\nF.K.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrosvenor Clarkson, who was first Secretary and then Director of\r\nthe Council of National Defense, writes in February, 1922, this\r\naccount of the work of the Council:--\r\n\r\n\"As early as February 12, 1917, or nearly two months before we\r\nwent into the war, Secretary Lane presented resolutions at a joint\r\nmeeting of the Council of National Defense and its Advisory\r\nCommission, to the effect that the Council 'Call a series of\r\nconferences with the leading men in each industry, fundamentally\r\nnecessary to the defense of the country in the event of war.' The\r\nresolutions also proposed that the Council at once proceed to\r\nconfer with those familiar with the manner by which foreign\r\ngovernments in the war enlisted their industries and, further,\r\nthat the Council should establish a committee to investigate and\r\nreport upon such regulations as to hours and safety of labor as\r\nshould apply to all war labor.\r\n\r\n\"Secretary Lane's resolution was referred to the Advisory\r\nCommission, and on February 13, at a joint meeting of the Council\r\nand Commission, the matter was thoroughly discussed. Out of this\r\nresolution grew the famous cooperative committees of the Advisory\r\nCommission. Here was the inception of the dollar-a-year man.\r\n\r\n\"This organization, set up by the Advisory Commission, furnished\r\nfor the first eight or ten months of our participation in the war,\r\nalmost the only thing in the way of a war machine under the\r\ngovernment on the civilian or industrial side.\r\n\r\n\"In the first week of May, 1917, the Council of National Defense\r\ncalled to Washington representatives of each state in the Union,\r\nto confer with the federal government as to the common prosecution\r\nof the war. The state delegates, consisting of many Governors and\r\nin each case of leading citizens of the respective commonwealths,\r\nwere received by the six Cabinet officers, forming the Council, in\r\nthe office of Secretary Baker in April.\r\n\r\n\"Secretary Lane thought that the most effective way to wake the\r\ncountry up out of its dream of security was to tell the truth\r\nabout the submarine losses, the country up to that time not having\r\nreally appreciated what the losses amounted to. He said, 'The\r\nPresident is going to address the State representatives at the\r\nWhite House, and I am going to urge him to cut loose on the\r\nsubmarine losses,' and he asked me to prepare a memorandum for him\r\nto give to the President. This I did. The President, however,\r\napparently decided not to go into the subject, and Secretary Lane,\r\nwith a courage that can only be appreciated by those who knew the\r\natmosphere of official Washington at that time, decided to take\r\nthe bull by the horns himself, and at the next meeting with the\r\nrepresentatives with the Council in Secretary Baker's office,\r\nSecretary Lane ... cut loose and told the actual truth about\r\nsubmarine losses at that time. ... The next morning it was the\r\nstory of the day in the newspapers and it did as much to arouse\r\nthe country as a whole as to what we were up against as any one\r\nthing that occurred during this period, save only the President's\r\nwar message itself.\r\n\r\n\"Secretary Lane became chairman of the field division of the\r\nCouncil of National Defense toward the end of the war. This was\r\nthe body that guided and coordinated the work of the 184,000 units\r\nof the state, county, community, and municipal Councils of\r\nDefense, and of those of the Woman's Committee of the Council--no\r\ndoubt the greatest organization of the kind that the world has\r\never known.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo George W. Lane\r\n\r\nWashington, May 3, 1917\r\n\r\nThese are great days. Their significance will not be realized for\r\nmany years. We are forming a close union with France and England.\r\nThe most impressive sight I have ever seen was that at\r\nWashington's tomb last Sunday. We went down on the Mayflower--the\r\nFrench and the English commissions and the members of the Cabinet.\r\nViviani and Balfour spoke. Joffre laid a bronze palm upon\r\nWashington's tomb, then stood up in his soldierly way and stood at\r\nsalute for a minute, Balfour laid a wreath of lilies upon the\r\ntomb, and leaned over as if in prayer. Above the tomb, for the\r\nfirst time, flew the flag of another country than our own, the\r\nStars and Stripes, and on either side, the British Jack and the\r\nFrench Tricolor. This is a combination of the Democracies of the\r\nworld against feudalism and autocracy.\r\n\r\nI heard a story from one of Joffre's aides. Joffre, by the way, is\r\nthe quietest, sweetest, most naive, and babylike individual I ever\r\nmet. All of the women, as well as the men, are in love with him.\r\nWhen he met Nancy, at a garden party, he kissed her on both\r\ncheeks. Nancy, as you may imagine, was ecstatically delighted.\r\nThis simple, grave, kindly soldier sat in his room while the\r\nGermans came marching upon Paris, saying nothing. Every few\r\nminutes an aide would come in and move the French markers back\r\nupon the map, and the German markers forward, toward Paris. Day\r\nafter day he saw this advance, but said nothing. At last when they\r\ncame to the valley of the Marne, an aide came in and marked the\r\nmap, showing that the Germans were within thirty miles of Paris.\r\nThen Joffre quietly said, \"This thing has gone far enough,\" and\r\ntaking up a pad of paper he called to his troops to stand fast and\r\ndie upon the Marne, if necessary, to save France. There is nothing\r\nfiner than this in history.\r\n\r\nJoffre has a skin like a baby. He has the utmost frankness and\r\nsimplicity of speech. When McAdoo asked him at the White House if\r\nthe present drive was satisfactory, he said in the most innocent\r\nway, \"I am not there.\" Viviani, who is the head of the French\r\nCommission, is as jealous as a prima donna, terribly jealous of\r\nJoffre, (which makes Joffre feel most uncomfortable) because, of\r\ncourse, Joffre is the hero of the Marne.\r\n\r\nI spoke at the Belasco Theatre the other day for the benefit of\r\nthe French war relief fund, introducing Ambassador Herrick and the\r\nlecturer, a young Frenchman. Joffre and Viviani were in a box.\r\nEvery mention of the name of Joffre brought the people to their\r\nfeet. Yesterday I spoke again at a meeting of the State Councils\r\nof Defense and I enclose you what the New York Post had to say.\r\n\r\nLast night I dined with Balfour. I have seen quite a little of\r\nhim. He is sixty-nine years old and stands about six feet two. He\r\nis a perfect type of the aristocratic Englishman, with a charming\r\nsmile. His real heart is in the study of philosophy. Anne sat next\r\nto him at dinner and he told her that he believed in a personal\r\nGod, personal identity after death, and answer to prayer, which is\r\na remarkable statement of faith for one who has lived through our\r\nscientific age. I think at bottom he is a mystic.\r\n\r\nOn all sides they are frank in telling of their distress. We did\r\nnot come in a minute too soon. England and France, I believe, were\r\ngone if we had not come in. It delights me to see how much\r\nsympathy there is with England as well as with France. The Irish\r\nalone seem to be unreconciled with England as our ally.\r\n\r\nNed got your letter, and I suppose in time will answer it, I had\r\nthe question put to me by Baker yesterday as to whether I wished\r\nhim to go to the other side, and I had to say frankly that I did.\r\nIt was to me the most momentous decision that I have made in the\r\nwar. He has passed his final test, and I hope that he will get his\r\ncommission in a few days.\r\n\r\nTo-night we give a dinner to the Canadians, Sir George Foster, the\r\nacting Premier, and Sir Joseph Polk, the Under Secretary of\r\nExternal Affairs, who, by the way, was born in Charlottetown,\r\nPrince Edward Island, and says he heard our father preach.\r\n\r\nThe country's crops are going to be short, I fear, and we have had\r\nlittle rain. Ships and grain--these are the two things that we\r\nmust get. Ships, to carry our grain and our locomotives and rails,\r\nand grain to keep the fighters alive. The U-boats are destroying\r\ntwice as much as the producing tonnage of the world. We need every\r\nbushel that California can produce. With much love, affectionately\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nF.K.L.\r\n\r\nTo Frank I. Cobb New York World\r\n\r\nWashington, May 5, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR COBB,--I had a long talk with Hoover yesterday. He tells\r\nme that the U-boat situation is really worse than I stated it.\r\nThere is no question but that the actual sinkings amounted to more\r\nthan 300,000 tons in a week, and if we add those put out of\r\nbusiness by mines, they will exceed 400,000 tons. The French are\r\nabsolutely desperate. One of the French ministers told Hoover that\r\nthey had fixed on the first of November as their last day, if the\r\nUnited States had not come in. Admiral Chocheprat told me, with\r\ntears in his eyes, three nights ago, that they felt themselves\r\nhelpless. They were absolutely at the mercy of the submarines\r\nbecause of their lack of destroyers, and they had feared we were\r\npreparing to defend our own shores rather than fight across the\r\nwater. I know that the latter has been the policy of the heads of\r\nthe Navy Department.\r\n\r\nDo not, I beg of you, minimize the immediate danger. This is the\r\ntime to defend the United States; and the United States is\r\nwoefully indifferent to its dangers and to the needs of the\r\nsituation. We have been carrying on a ship-building program with\r\nreference to conditions after the war. It is only within ten days\r\nthat we have realized that the end of the war will be one of\r\ndefeat unless we build twice as fast as we proposed to build. You\r\nknow that I am not pessimistic. It is not my habit to look upon\r\nthe gloomy side of things. It is no kindness to the American\r\npeople or to France or England to give them words of good cheer\r\nnow. This war is right at this minute a challenge to every\r\nparticle of brains and inventive skill that we have got.\r\n\r\nPlease treat this as entirely confidential. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nMay 8\r\n\r\nThe only dissension in the Council is over the use that will be\r\nmade of Hoover. Houston, I think, is rather making a mistake,\r\nthough it may work out all right. I hope it will.\r\n\r\nDon't \"bat\" us; we are a nervous lot right now. ...\r\n\r\n\"Lane was among the first to grasp the bigness of the danger to\r\nthe allied cause,\" James S. Harlan says, \"in Germany's underwater\r\nattack on the merchant marine of the world. He also realized the\r\nmagnitude of the task of frustrating the new peril and the need of\r\nprompt measures to save the situation. Lane had no anxieties or\r\nhesitations in his personal contact with big men; but he had a\r\ngenuine fear of small men when big things were doing. And so in\r\nthis great emergency he naturally thought of Schwab. How well I\r\nrecall the fine force and vigor in his expression when, rising\r\nfrom his chair and standing with clenched fist pointed at me, he\r\nsaid in substance:--'The President ought to send for Schwab and\r\nhand him a treasury warrant for a billion dollars and set him to\r\nwork building ships, with no government inspectors or supervisors\r\nor accountants or auditors or other red tape to bother him. Let\r\nthe President just put it up to Schwab's patriotism and put Schwab\r\non his honor. Nothing more is needed. Schwab will do the job.'\r\n\r\n\"This was a full year before Schwab was called down to Washington\r\nto talk over the question of building ships.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Will Irwin Paris, France\r\n\r\nWashington, July 21, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WILL,--I have just received your letter. Thank you very\r\nmuch for what you say of my speech. I am doing my damndest to keep\r\nthings going here but it is awfully hard work, because the minute\r\nmy head raises above the water some neighboring ship plugs it.\r\n\r\nI think you are dead right in staying with the Post. The feeling\r\nhere is that we are not getting real facts regarding the\r\ndesperateness of the U-boat situation. We need to be told facts in\r\norder to have our minds challenged. We are not cowards, and I hope\r\nyou will give us realistic pictures of just what is happening if\r\nyou can. ...\r\n\r\nMy boy is the youngest lieutenant in the Army--nine-teen. He goes\r\nnext week to Illinois as an instructor in aviation, and I suppose\r\nin a little while when he gets the machines, he will be crossing\r\nover.\r\n\r\nWith warm affection, my dear Will. Always yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Robert Lansing Secretary of State\r\n\r\nBeverly, Massachusetts. [August, 1917]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LANSING,--I had lunch yesterday with Colonel House who\r\nasked me what I thought should be done as to the Pope's appeal for\r\npeace. I told him I thought it should be taken seriously. He\r\nagreed and asked what the President should say. I answered that,\r\ninasmuch as all the evidence pointed to the conclusion that the\r\nGerman Centerists and Austria were responsible for this appeal,\r\nthat we could not afford to have them feel that we were for a\r\npolicy of annihilation,--for this would be playing the War\r\nParty's game and would place the burden on us of continuing the\r\nwar. And this we could neither afford [to do] at home or abroad.\r\nThis opportunity should be seized, I said, to make plain not so\r\nmuch our terms of peace as the things in Germany that seemed to\r\nmake peace difficult,--Germany's attitude toward the world, the\r\nspirit against which we are fighting. That we wished peace; that\r\nwe had been patient to the limit; that we had come in in the hope\r\nthat we could destroy the idea in the German mind that it could\r\nimpose its authority and system, by force, upon an unwilling\r\nworld; that we were not opposed to talking peace, provided, at the\r\noutset, and as a SINE QUA NON, the Central Powers would assume\r\nthat Government by the Soldier was not a possibility in the 20th\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThe Colonel said that he had written the President to this same\r\neffect. That he had written you, or not, he did not say. So I am\r\ntelling you the Colonel's view for your own benefit. He thought\r\nthat the Allies would strongly insist upon concerted action,\r\nputting aside the Pope's appeal, and that this had to be resisted,\r\nfor we should play our own game. I find all I meet here strong for\r\nthe war, but of course I only meet the high-spirited. There is\r\nmuch feeling that we are going about it too mechanically, with too\r\nlittle emotion and passion. ... As always,\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nToward the middle of August, Lane started for Mount Desert to\r\ninspect the proposed National Park created there through the\r\npublic-spirited devotion of George B. Dorr. This northern trip was\r\ntaken to decide whether he would accept, as Secretary of the\r\nInterior, this addition to the National Parks. Two years later in\r\nwriting to Senator Myers, Chairman of the Committee on Public\r\nLands, of this National Park, the only one east of the\r\nMississippi, Lane said, \"The name Lafayette is substituted for\r\nthat of Mount Desert, the name proposed by the former bill, and I\r\nconsider it singularly appropriate that the name of Lafayette\r\nshould be commemorated by these splendid mountains facing on the\r\nsea, on what was once a corner of Old France, and with it the\r\nearly friendship of the two nations which are so closely allied in\r\nthe present war.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: Franklin K. Lane and George B. Dorr in\r\nLafayette National Park, Mount Desert Island, Maine]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Henry Lane Eno Bar Harbori, Maine\r\n\r\nWashington, Saturday, [September 2, 1917]\r\n\r\nThere are not many weeks in a man's life of which he can say that\r\none was without a flaw, that it could not have been improved upon\r\nin company, comfort, or surroundings. And all these things, my\r\ndear Mr. Eno, I can affirm of the days spent with you. I have a\r\nbetter opinion of my fellows and of my country because of them.\r\nPerhaps, after all, that is as complete a test as any other. As I\r\nlook back I think of but one thing that gives occasion for regret\r\n--we had too few good, mind-stretching talks, you, Dorr, and\r\nmyself. But those we had were certainly not about affairs of small\r\nconcern. We indulged ourselves as social philosophers,\r\npsychologists, war-makers, and international statesmen. The world\r\nwas ours, and more--the worlds beyond. To do things worth while by\r\nday, and to dream things worth while by night, and to believe that\r\nboth are worth while, that is the perfect life. If one can't get\r\nto Heaven by following that course, then are we lost.\r\n\r\nI am sending a line to Dorr, noble, unselfish, high-spirited,\r\nbroad-minded gentleman that he is. ... Sincerely and heartily\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo George Dorr, Bar Harbor, Maine\r\n\r\nWashington, [September 2,1917]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. DORR,--You do not know what good you did my tired\r\npolitics-soaked soul by showing me, under such happy conditions,\r\nthe beauties and the possibilities of your island. And I came to\r\nknow two men at least, whose heads and hearts were working for a\r\nless pudgy and flat-footed world. ... To have enthusiasm is to\r\nbeat the Devil. So I have you down in my Saints' book.\r\n\r\nYou know a man in politics is always looking about for some place\r\nto which he can retire when the whirligig brings in another group\r\nof more popular patriots. Now I can frankly say that if I could\r\nhave an extended term of exile on your island with you and your\r\nfriends, I would feel reconciled to banishment from politics for\r\nlife, provided however (I must say this for conscience' sake) that\r\nwe had time and money to make the Park what it should be--a\r\ndemonstration school for the American to show how much he can add\r\nto the beauty of Nature.\r\n\r\nA wilderness, no matter how impressive and beautiful, does not\r\nsatisfy this soul of mine, (if I have that kind of thing). It is a\r\nchallenge to man. It says, \"Master me! Put me to use! Make me\r\nsomething more than I am.\" So what you have done in the Park--the\r\nSpring House and the Arts Building, the cliff trails and the\r\nopened woods, show how much may be added by the love and thought\r\nof man. May the Gods be good to you, the God of Mammon\r\nimmediately, that your dreams may come true, and that you may give\r\nto others the pleasure you gave to yours sincerely,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HON. WOODROW WILSON THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\nWashington, September 21, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--It will interest you to know that the\r\nCommission which I sent up this year to Alaska to look into the\r\nAlaskan Railroad matters has just returned. The engineer on this\r\nCommission was Mr. Wendt, who was formerly Chief Engineer of the\r\nPittsburg and Lake Erie Railroad, and who is now in charge of the\r\nappraisal of eastern roads under the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission. He tells me that our Alaskan road could not have been\r\nbuilt for less money if handled by a private concern; that he has\r\nnever seen any railroad camps where the men were provided with as\r\ngood food and where there was such care taken of their health.\r\nThey have had no smallpox and but one case of typhoid fever. No\r\nliquor is allowed on the line of the road. The road in his\r\njudgment has followed the best possible location. Our hospitals\r\nare well run. The compensation plan adopted for injuries is\r\nsatisfactory to the men.\r\n\r\nI have directed that all possible speed be made in connecting the\r\nMatanuska coal fields with Seward. This involves the heaviest\r\nconstruction that we will have to undertake, which is along\r\nTurnagain Ann, but by the middle of next year, no strikes\r\nintervening, and transportation for supplies being available, this\r\npart of the work should be done. Faithfully and cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nIn Lane's Annual REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, dated\r\nNovember 20, 1919, he writes of the Alaskan railroad enterprise:--\r\n\"One of the first recommendations made by me in my report of seven\r\nyears ago was that the Government build a railroad from Seward to\r\nFairbanks in Alaska. Five years ago you intrusted to me the\r\ndirection of this work. The road is now more than two-thirds built\r\nand Congress at this session after exhaustively examining into the\r\nwork has authorized an additional appropriation sufficient for its\r\ncompletion. The showing made before Congress was that the road had\r\nbeen built without graft; every dollar has gone into actual work\r\nor material. It has been built without giving profits to any large\r\ncontractors, for it has been constructed entirely by small\r\ncontractors or by day's labor. It has been built without touch of\r\npolitics; every man on the road has been chosen exclusively for\r\nability and experience.\"\r\n\r\nThis memorandum touching the early history of Alaska was found in\r\nLane's files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUSCRIPT NOTE\r\n\r\nWashington, December 29, 1911\r\n\r\nLast night I dined with Charles Henry Butler, reporter for the\r\nSupreme Court and a son of William Alien Butler, for so long a\r\nleader of the New York bar.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the evening Mr. Charles Glover, President of the\r\nRiggs National Bank, told me this bit of history. That when he was\r\na boy, in the bank one day Mr. Cochran came to him and handed him\r\ntwo warrants upon the United States Treasury, one for $1,400,000.\r\nand the other for $5,800,000. He said, \"Put those in the safe.\"\r\nMr. Glover did so, and they remained there for a week, when they\r\nwere sent to New York. Mr., Glover said \"These warrants were the\r\npayment of Russia for the Territory of Alaska. Why were there two\r\nwarrants? I never knew until some years later, when I learned the\r\nstory from Senator Dawes, who said that prior to the war, there\r\nhad been some negotiations between the United States and Russia\r\nfor the purchase of Alaska, and the price of $1,400,000. was\r\nagreed upon. In fact this was the amount that Russia asked for\r\nthis great territory, which was regarded as nothing more than a\r\nbarren field of ice.\r\n\r\n\"During the war the matter lay dormant. We had more territory than\r\nwe could take care of. When England, however, began to manifest\r\nher friendly disposition toward the Confederacy, and we learned\r\nfrom Europe that England and France were carrying on negotiations\r\nfor the recognition of the Southern States, and possibly of some\r\nmanifestation by their fleets against the blockade which we had\r\ninstituted, (and which they claimed was not effective and merely a\r\npaper blockade), we looked about for a friend, and Russia was the\r\nonly European country upon whose friendship we could rely.\r\nThereupon Secretary Seward secured from Russia a demonstration, in\r\nAmerican ports, of Russian friendship. Her ships of war sailed to\r\nboth of our coasts, the Atlantic and Pacific, with the\r\nunderstanding that the expense of this demonstration should be met\r\nby the United States, out of the contingent fund. It was to be a\r\nsecret matter. \"The war came to a close, and immediately\r\nthereafter Lincoln was assassinated and the administration\r\nchanged. It was no longer possible to pay for this demonstration,\r\nsecretly, under the excuse of war, but a way was found for paying\r\nRussia through the purchase of Alaska. The warrant for $1,400,000.\r\nwas the warrant for the purchase of Alaska, the warrant for\r\n$5,800,000. was for Russia's expenses in her naval demonstration\r\nin our behalf, but history only knows the fact that the United\r\nStates paid $7,200,000. for this territory, which is now\r\ndemonstrated to be one of the richest portions of the earth in\r\nmineral deposits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HON. WOODROW WILSON\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\nWashington, November 3, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--On April 7, 1917, the Council of National\r\nDefense adopted a report, submitted by the Chairman of the\r\nExecutive Committee on Labor of the Advisory Commission of the\r\nCouncil, urging that no change in existing standards be made\r\nduring the war, by either employers or employees, except with the\r\napproval of the Council of National Defense. ...\r\n\r\nThe next step for producing efficiency must be no strikes.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention of the American Federation of Labor,\r\nconsisting of international unions, will be held at Buffalo on\r\nNovember 12th. I would urge that about thirty executives of the\r\nunions, which more directly control essential war production, be\r\ninvited to confer with you prior to that date, to determine on a\r\npolicy which will prevent the constant interruption of production\r\nfor war purposes. The Commissioners of Conciliation of the\r\nDepartment of Labor and the President's Commission have a\r\nwonderful record of accomplishments for settling strikes after\r\nthey have occurred. Organized labor should give the Government the\r\nopportunity to adjust controversies before strikes occur.\r\n\r\nAt this conference it could safely be made plain that for the war,\r\nemployers would agree not to object to the peaceable extension of\r\ntrade unionism; that they would make no efforts to \"open\" a\r\n\"closed shop\"; that they would submit all controversies concerning\r\nstandards, including wages and lockouts, to any official body on\r\nwhich they have equal representation with labor, and would abide\r\nby its decisions; that they would adhere strictly to health and\r\nsafety laws, and laws concerning woman and child labor; that they\r\nwould not lower prices now in force for piece work, except by\r\nGovernment direction; that if a union in a \"closed\" shop after due\r\nnotice was unable to furnish sufficient workers, any non-union\r\nemployees taken on would be the first to be dismissed on the\r\ncontraction of business, and the shop restored to its previous\r\n\"closed\" status; that the only barrier in the way of steady\r\nproduction is the unwillingness of the unions to uphold the\r\nproposition of settlement before a strike, instead of after a\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nThe imminence of this convention seems to me to make some step\r\nnecessary at this time. I would take the matter up with Secretary\r\nWilson were he here, and have sent a copy of this letter to him.\r\nYou undoubtedly can put an end to this most serious situation by\r\ncalling on the international labor leaders to take a stand that\r\nwill not be so radical as that taken in England, and yet will\r\ninsure to the men good wages and good conditions, and make sure\r\nthat our industry will not be paralyzed. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO J. O'H. COSGRAVE NEW YORK WORLD\r\n\r\nWashington, December 21, 1917\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JACK,--My spirit does not permit me to give you an\r\ninterview on the moral benefits of the war. This would be sheer\r\ncamouflage. Of course, we will get some good out of it, and we\r\nwill learn some efficiency--if that is a moral benefit--and a\r\npurer sense of nationalism. But the war will degrade us. That is\r\nthe plain fact, make sheer brutes out of us, because we will have\r\nto descend to the methods that the Germans employ.\r\n\r\nSo you must go somewhere else for your uplift stuff. Cordially\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN E. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nCABINET NOTES IN WAR-TIME\r\n\r\n1918\r\n\r\nNotes on Cabinet Meetings--School Gardens--A Democracy Lacks\r\nForesight--Use of National Resources--Washington in War-time--The\r\nSacrifice of War--Farms for Soldiers\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES ON CABINET MEETINGS\r\n\r\nFOUND IN LANE'S FILES\r\n\r\nFebruary 25, 1918\r\n\r\nAs I entered the building this morning Dr. Parsons [Footnote: Of\r\nthe Department of the Interior, Bureau of Mines.] met me. I asked\r\nhow the cyanide plant was getting on. His reply was to ask if he\r\nmight request the War Department to allow us to make the contract\r\n--that he could have the whole thing done in two days. This is\r\nwhere we are at the end of more than six months of effort. It is\r\nhopeless! We find the process, everything!--but cannot get the\r\ncontract, through the intricate, infinite fault-findings and\r\nnegligence of the War Department.\r\n\r\nManning [Footnote: Of the Department of the Interior, Bureau of\r\nMines.] came to see me to say that he expected, after the Overman\r\nbill was passed, that the President would take over the gas work--\r\norder it into the War Department. He had been asked twice if he\r\ncould be tempted by a uniform into that Department, and had said\r\nthat he was freer as a civilian,--had planned the work and\r\ngathered the force as a civilian, and would not leave the\r\nDepartment. He felt damned sore and indignant, that a work so well\r\ndone should be the subject of envy, and possibly be made less\r\neffective and useful. ...\r\n\r\nEverit Macy lunched with me and told me the sad story of the\r\nmishandling of labor affairs by the Shipping Board. He had gone to\r\nthe Pacific Coast and with his colleagues, Coolidge and others,\r\nmade an agreement with the shipbuilding trades. Five dollars and\r\ntwenty-five cents for machinists, etc. In Seattle, however,\r\nbecause of one firm's bidding for labor, he felt that there would\r\nhave to come a strike before this schedule would be accepted.\r\nBefore he got back the threatened strike came, and then the demand\r\nof the men for a ten per cent bonus was acceded to, upsetting all\r\nother settlements in San Francisco, Portland, Los Angeles, etc.\r\nResult, ten per cent gain everywhere. And now the Eastern and\r\nSouthern men ask the Pacific scale, and he can't see how it can be\r\navoided, nor can I. They will have to standardize all wages.\r\n\r\nPoor chap, his advice was scorned, for he protested against the\r\nbonus being given to Seattle, and as he said, \"If it had not been\r\nwar-time I would have resigned.\" To increase the men in the South,\r\nto this unprecedented scale, will not get more ships, he fears,\r\nbut less, for they will not work if they have wages in four days,\r\nequal to seven days' needs. I advised for standardization. He said\r\nthe Navy wouldn't hear of it, as it would demoralize their yards.\r\n...\r\n\r\nPolitics, politics, curse of the country! It has gotten into the\r\nwhole war program. Hoover and McAdoo are at swords drawn. Hoover\r\nhad a cable signed by the three Premiers, George, Clemenceau, and\r\nOrlando, crying for wheat and charging us with not keeping our\r\nword--and starvation threatening all three countries--in fact,\r\nalmost sure, because we have not been able to get the wheat to the\r\nships; and with starvation will come revolution, if it gets bad\r\nenough. ... I asked Hoover about this on Sunday night, ... and he\r\nsaid that a list of eight hundred cars had been on McAdoo's desk\r\nFOR A WEEK. ...\r\n\r\n(McChord said on the bench [Footnote: The Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission.] to-day that he thought Hoover seventy-five per cent\r\nright.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 1, [1918]\r\n\r\nYesterday, at Cabinet meeting, we had the first real talk on the\r\nwar in weeks, yes, in months! Burleson brought up the matter of\r\nRussia, ... would we support Japan in taking Siberia, or even\r\nVladivostock? Should we join Japan actively--in force?\r\n\r\nThe President said \"No,\" for the very practical reason that we had\r\nno ships. We had difficulty in providing for our men in France and\r\nfor our Allies, (the President never uses this word, saying that\r\nwe are not \"allies\"). How hopeless it would be to carry everything\r\nseven or eight thousand miles--not only men and munitions, but\r\nfood!--for Japan has none to spare, and none we could eat. Her men\r\nfeed on rice and smoked fish, and she raises nothing we would\r\nwant. Nor could the country support us. So there was an end of\r\ntalking of an American force in Siberia! Yes, we were needed--\r\nperhaps as a guarantee of good faith on Japan's part that she\r\nwould not go too far, nor stay too long. But we would not do it.\r\nAnd besides, Russia would not like it, therefore we must keep\r\nhands off and let Japan take the blame and the responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe question is not simple, for Russia will say that we threw her\r\nto Japan, and possibly she would rush into Germany's arms as the\r\nlesser of evils. My single word of caution was to so act that\r\nRussia, when she \"came back,\" should not hate us, for there was\r\nour new land for development--Siberia--and we should have front\r\nplace at that table, if we did not let our fears and our hatred\r\nand our contempt get away with us now.\r\n\r\nDaniels whispered to-day that Russia had five fast cruisers in the\r\nBaltic, which could raid the Atlantic and put our ships off the\r\nsea. He had wired Sims to see if they couldn't be sunk. I hope\r\nit is not too late; surely England must have done something on so\r\nimportant a matter, though she is slow in thinking. And how is\r\nanyone to get there with the Baltic full of submarines and mines!\r\nThe thought is horrible, the possibilities! We certainly have made\r\na bad fist of things Russian from the start. They have deserted us\r\nbecause they were trying to drive the cart ahead of the horse,\r\neconomical revolution before political revolution, socialism ahead\r\nof liberty with law. And they know we are capitalistic, because we\r\ndo not approve of socialism by force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMarch 12, (1918)\r\n\r\nNothing talked of at Cabinet that would interest a nation, a\r\nfamily, or a child. No talk of the war. No talk of Russia or\r\nJapan. Talk by McAdoo about some bills in Congress, by the\r\nPresident about giving the veterans of the Spanish war leave, with\r\npay, to attend their annual encampment. And he treated this\r\nseriously as if it were a matter of first importance! No word from\r\nBaker nor mention of his mission or his doings. ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRANKLIN K. LANE, JR.\r\n\r\nSOMEWHERE IN FRANCE\r\n\r\nWashington, February 15, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BOY,--... We are anxiously awaiting some word telling\r\nwhere you are, what you are doing, and how you got on in your\r\ntrip. I thought your cablegram was a model of condensation, quite\r\nlike that of Caesar, \"Veni, vidi, vici.\" ...\r\n\r\nSergeant Empey has just left the office with a letter to the\r\nSecretary of War, asking that he be given a commission. He has\r\nbeen lecturing among the cantonments and wants to get back to\r\nFrance. ... He says that the boys in the cantonments are anxious to\r\ngo across, and that they are beginning to criticise us because\r\nthey do not have their chance. But they will all get there soon\r\nenough for them. Our national problem is to get ships to carry\r\nthem, and to carry the food for the Allies. ... We have undertaken\r\nto supply a certain amount of food to the other side, and our\r\ncontract, so far, has not been fulfilled. During December and\r\nJanuary, however, this was, of course, due to railroad conditions.\r\n\r\nYou are a long way off, but you must not visualize the distance.\r\nNothing so breaks the spirit as to dwell upon unfortunate facts.\r\nSome one day or another you had to leave the nest, and this is\r\nyour day for flying. Wherever you are, with people whose language\r\nyou understand only imperfectly, with a civilization that is\r\nsomewhat strange, and under conditions that often-times will be\r\ntrying, don't adopt the usual attitude of the American in a\r\nforeign country and wonder \"why the damn fools don't speak\r\nEnglish.\" No doubt some of the French will pity you because of\r\nyour delinquency in their language.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that differentiates us from other people is our\r\nlavishness in expenditure, and in what appears to us to be their\r\n\"nearness.\" ... From these same thrifty French have come great\r\nthings. They have always been great soldiers; they have led the\r\nworld in the arts, especially in poetry, painting and fiction--\r\nperhaps, too, I should add architecture. So that men who are\r\ncareful of their pennies are not necessarily small in their minds.\r\n...\r\n\r\nI have less doubt, however, of your ability to get on with the\r\nFrenchman than I have with the Englishman. ... You will have\r\ndifficulty--at least I should--in understanding the rather heavy,\r\nsober, non-humorous Englishman. ... He is always a self-important\r\ngentleman who regards England as having spoken pretty much the\r\nlast word in all things, and who will abuse his own country, his\r\ncountrymen, and institutions, frankly and with abandon, but will\r\nallow no one else this liberty. He is not a \"quitter\" though, and\r\nhe has done his bit through the centuries for the making of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n... See as many people as you can, present all your letters,\r\naccept invitations. Remember that while you are there and we miss\r\nyou, we are not spending our time in moping. Every night we go to\r\ndinner and we chatter with the rest of the magpies, as if the\r\nworld were free from suffering. Last night I talked with\r\nPaderewski for an hour on the sorrows of Poland, and it was one\r\nlong tale of horror. ...\r\n\r\nTo-day the Russians are calling their people back to arms to stop\r\nthe oncoming Germans. Foolish, foolish idealists who believed that\r\nthey could establish what they call an economic democracy, without\r\nbeing willing to support their ideal in modern fashion by force.\r\nThe best of things can not live unless they are fought for, and\r\nwhile I do not think that their socialism was the best of\r\nanything, it was their dream. ... With much love, my dear boy,\r\nyour DAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo George W. Lane February 16, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--... Things are going much better with the War\r\nDepartment. My expectation is that this war will resolve itself\r\ninto three things, in this order:--ships for food, aeroplanes, big\r\nguns. We must, as you know, do all that we can to keep up the\r\nmorale of our own people. There is a considerable percentage of\r\npacifists, and of the weak-hearted ones, who would like to have a\r\npeace now upon any terms, but the treatment that Russia is\r\nreceiving, after she had thrown down her arms, indicates what may\r\nbe expected by any nation that quits now.\r\n\r\n... The prospects for democratization of Germany is not as good as\r\nit was a year ago, when we came in, because of their success in\r\narms due to Russia's debacle. The people will not overthrow a\r\ngovernment which is successful, nor will they be inclined to\r\ndesert a system which adds to Germany's glory. It is a fight, a\r\nlong fight, a fight of tremendous sacrifice, that we are in for. I\r\nsaid a year ago that it would be two years. Then I thought that\r\nRussia would put up some kind of front. Now I say two years from\r\nthis time and possibly a great deal longer. Lord Northcliffe\r\nthinks four or six or eight years.\r\n\r\nNed writes me that things are very gloomy and glum in England and\r\nin Ireland, where he has been. He was out in an air raid, in\r\nseveral of them, in London, not up in the air, but from the ground\r\ncould see no trace of the airships that were dropping bombs on the\r\ntown. The Germans seem to have discovered some way by which they\r\ncan tell where they are without being able to see the lights of\r\nthe city, for now they have bombarded Paris when it was protected,\r\non a dark night, by a blanket of fog, and London also under the\r\nsame conditions. The compass is not much good, the deviations are\r\nso great. It may be that the clever Huns have found some way of\r\npiloting themselves surely. We are starting two campaigns through\r\nthe Bureau of Education which may interest you. One is for school\r\ngardens. To have the children organized, each one to plant a\r\ngarden. The plan is to raise vegetables which will save things\r\nthat can be sent over to the armies, and also give the children a\r\nsense of being in the war. Another thing we are trying to do is\r\neducate the foreign born and the native born who cannot read or\r\nwrite English. If you are interested in either of these two things\r\nwe will send you literature, and you can name your own district,\r\nand we will put you at work. ...\r\n\r\nWell, my dear fellow, I long very much for the sun and the\r\nsweetness of California these days, but I could not enjoy myself\r\nif I were there, because I am at such tension that I must be doing\r\nevery day. Do write me often, even though I do not answer.\r\nAffectionately yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ALBERT SHAW\r\n\r\nREVIEW OF REVIEWS\r\n\r\nWashington, March 7, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DR. SHAW,--I have your letter of March 4th. The thing that\r\na democracy is short on is foresight. We do not have enough men\r\nlike the General Staff in Germany who can think ten and twenty\r\nyears ahead. We are too much embedded and incrusted in the things\r\nthat flow around us during the day, and think too little of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nFor five, long, weary years, I have been agitating for the use of\r\nthe water powers of the United States. We estimate the unused\r\npower in tens and tens of millions of horse-power. Right in New\r\nYork you have in the Erie Canal 150,000 horse-power, and on the\r\nNiagara river you have probably a million unused. If you had a\r\ngreat dam across the river below the rapids we should have water\r\npower in chains, like fire horses in their stalls, that could be\r\nbrought out at the time of need. But we are thinking in large\r\nfigures these days, and while we used to be afraid to ask for a\r\nfew hundred thousand dollars we now talk in millions, and some day\r\nwe may realize that to put the cost of a week's war into power\r\nplants in the United States would be money well invested. ...\r\n\r\nWe have no law under which private capital feels justified in\r\ninvesting a dollar in a water power plant where public lands are\r\ninvolved, because the permit granted is revokable at the pleasure\r\nof the Secretary of the Interior, and capital does not enjoy the\r\nprospect of making its future returns dependent upon the good\r\ndigestion of the Secretary. But if we get this bill, which I\r\nenclose, through, we will be able to handle the powers on all\r\nstreams on the public lands and forests and on all navigable\r\nwaters, and give assurance to capital that it will be well taken\r\ncare of if it makes the investment. ...\r\n\r\nI am greatly pleased at the kind things you say about me. The\r\nlonger I am in office the more of an appetite I have for such\r\nfood. Hoover [Footnote: Hoover at this time was Food\r\nAdministrator.] can only commit one fatal mistake--to declare a\r\ntaflfyless day. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Edward J. Wheeler on February 1, 1917, he had written:--\r\n\r\n\"It is an outrage that we should have a total of nearly six\r\nmillion acres of land withdrawn for oil, three million for\r\nphosphates, and one million for water power sites, potash, etc.,\r\nand allow session after session of Congress to pass without\r\nproducing any legislation that will sensibly open these reserves\r\nto development. The extreme conservationists, who are really for\r\nholding the lands indefinitely in the Federal Government and\r\nunopened, and the extreme anti-conservationists, who are for\r\nturning all the public lands over to the States, have stood for\r\nyears against a rational system of national development.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough a great part of the energy of the Department of the\r\nInterior was, of necessity, diverted to forward war enterprises\r\nand to supply war necessities--chemical, metallurgical,\r\nstatistical--Lane steadily pressed forward the conduct of the\r\nnormal activities of the department. In his report for the year\r\n1918, he briefly summarizes this work,--\"The distribution, survey,\r\nand classification of our national lands; the care of the Indian\r\nwards of the Nation, their education, and the development of their\r\nvast estate; the carrying forward of our reclamation projects; the\r\nawarding and issuance of patents to inventors; the construction of\r\nthe Alaskan railroad and the supervision of the Territorial\r\naffairs of Alaska and Hawaii; the payment of pensions to Army and\r\nNavy veterans and their dependents; the promotion of education;\r\nthe custody and management of the national parks; the conservation\r\nof the lives of those who work in mines, and the study and\r\nguidance of the mining and metallurgical industries.\"\r\n\r\n To Walter H. Page\r\n\r\nWashington, March 16, 1918\r\n\r\nMy dear Mr. Ambassador,--I am the poorest of all living\r\ncorrespondents, in fact, I am a dead correspondent. I do not\r\nfunction. If it had not been so I would long since have answered\r\nyour notes, which have been in my basket, but I have had no time\r\nfor any personal correspondence, much as I delight in it, for I\r\nhave a very old-fashioned love for writing from day to day what\r\npops into my mind, contradicting each day what I said the day\r\nbefore, and gathering from my friends their impressions and their\r\nspirit the same way. For the first time in three months I have\r\nleisure enough ... to acknowledge a few of the accumulated\r\npersonal letters.\r\n\r\nLet me give you a glimpse of my day, just to compare it with your\r\nown and by way of contrasting life in two different spheres and on\r\ndifferent sides of the ocean. I get to my office at nine in the\r\nmorning and my day is broken up into fifteen-minute periods,\r\nduring which I see either my own people or others. I really write\r\nnone of my own letters, [Footnote: This referred to routine\r\nletters.] simply telling my secretaries whether the answer should\r\nbe \"yes\" or \"no.\" I lunch at my own desk and generally with my\r\nwife, who has charge of our war work in the Department. We have\r\nover thirteen hundred men who have gone out of this Department\r\ninto the Army. ... My day is broken into by Cabinet meeting twice\r\na week, meeting of the Council of National Defense twice a week,\r\nand latterly with long sessions every afternoon over the question\r\nof what railroad wages should be.\r\n\r\nMy office is a sort of place of last resort for those who are\r\ndiscouraged elsewhere, for Washington is no longer a city of set\r\nroutine and fixed habit. It is at last the center of the nation.\r\nNew York is no longer even the financial center. The newspapers\r\nare edited from here. Society centers here. All the industrial\r\nchiefs of the nation spend most of their time here. It is easier\r\nto find a great cattle king or automobile manufacturer or a\r\nrailroad president or a banker at the Shoreham or the Willard\r\nHotel than it is to find him in his own town. The surprising thing\r\nis that these great men who have made our country do not loom so\r\nlarge when brought to Washington and put to work. ... Every day I\r\nfind some man of many millions who has been here for months and\r\nwhose movements used to be a matter of newspaper notoriety, but I\r\ndid not know, even, that he was here. I leave my office at seven\r\no'clock, not having been out of it during the day except for a\r\nCabinet or Council meeting, take a wink of sleep, change my\r\nclothes and go to a dinner, for this, as you will remember, is the\r\none form of entertainment that Washington has permitted itself in\r\nthe war. The dinners are Hooverized,--three courses, little or no\r\nwheat, little or no meat, little or no sugar, a few serve wine.\r\nAnd round the table will always be found men in foreign uniforms,\r\nor some missionary from some great power who comes begging for\r\nboats or food. These dinners used to be places of great gossip,\r\nand chiefly anti-administration gossip, but the spirit of the\r\npeople is one of unequaled loyalty. The Republicans are as glad to\r\nhave Wilson as their President as are the Democrats, I think\r\nsometimes a little more glad, because many of the Democrats are\r\ndisgruntled over patronage or something else. The women are\r\nferocious in their hunt for spies, and their criticism is against\r\nwhat they think is indifference to this danger. Boys appear at\r\nthese dinners in the great houses, because of their uniforms, who\r\nwould never have been permitted even to come to the front door in\r\nother days, for all are potential heroes. Every woman carries her\r\nknitting, and it is seldom that you hear a croaker even among the\r\nmost luxurious class. Well, the dinner is over by half past ten,\r\nand I go home to an hour and a half's work, which has been sent\r\nfrom the office, and fall at last into a more or less troubled\r\nsleep. This is the daily round.\r\n\r\nI have not been to New York since the war began. I made one trip\r\nacross the continent speaking for the Liberty Loan, day and night.\r\nAnd this life is pretty much the life of all of us here. The\r\nPresident keeps up his spirits by going to the theatre three or\r\nfour times a week. There are no official functions at the White\r\nHouse, and everybody's teeth are set. The Allies need not doubt\r\nour resolution. England and France will break before we will, and\r\nI do not doubt their steadfast purpose. It is, as you said long\r\nago, their fault that this war has come, for they did not realize\r\nthe kind of an enemy they had, either in spirit, purpose, or\r\nstrength. But we will increasingly strengthen that western gate so\r\nthat the Huns will not break through.\r\n\r\nWe do things fast here, but I never realized before how slow we\r\nare in getting started. It takes a long time for us to get a new\r\nstride. I did not think that this was true industrially. I have\r\nknown that it was true politically for a long time, because this\r\nwas the most backward and most conservative of all the\r\ndemocracies. We take up new machinery of government so slowly. But\r\nindustrially it is also true. When told to change step we shift\r\nand stumble and halt and hesitate and go through all kinds of\r\nawkward misses. This has been true as to ships and aeroplanes and\r\nguns, big and little, and uniforms. Whatever the government has\r\ndone itself has been tied by endless red tape. It is hard for an\r\narmy officer to get out of the desk habit, and caution,\r\nconservatism, sureness, seem even in time of crisis to be more\r\nimportant than a bit of daring. In my Department, I figure that it\r\ntakes about seven years for the nerve of initiative and the nerve\r\nof imagination to atrophy, and so, perhaps, it is in other\r\ndepartments. It took five months for one of our war bureaus to get\r\nout a contract for a building that we were to build for them.\r\nFifteen men had to sign the contract. And of course we have been\r\nimpatient. But things are bettering every day. The men in the\r\ncamps are very impatient to get away. But where are the ships to\r\ndo all the work? The Republicans cannot chide us with all of the\r\nunpreparedness, for they stood in the way of our getting ships\r\nthree years ago. The gods have been against us in the way of\r\nweather so we have not brought down our supplies to the seaboard,\r\nbut we have not had the ships to take away that which was there;\r\nor coal, sometimes, for the ships.\r\n\r\nFrom now, however, you will see a steadier, surer movement of men,\r\nmunitions, food, and ships. The whole country is solidly, strongly\r\nwith the President. There are men in Congress bitterly against him\r\nbut they do not dare to raise their voices, because he has the\r\npeople so resolutely with him. The Russian overthrow has been a\r\ngood thing for us in one way. It will cost us perhaps a million\r\nlives, but it will prove to us the value of law and order. We are\r\nto have our troubles, and must change our system of life in the\r\nnext few years.\r\n\r\nA great oil man was in the office the other day and told me in a\r\nplain, matter-of-fact way, what must be done to win--the\r\nsacrifices that must be made--and he ended by saying, \"After all,\r\nwhat is property?\" This is a very pregnant question. It is not\r\nbeing asked in Russia alone. Who has the right to anything? My\r\nanswer is, not the man, necessarily, who has it, but the man who\r\ncan use it to good purpose. The way to find the latter man is the\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\nWe will have national woman suffrage, national prohibition,\r\ncontinuing inheritance tax, continuing income tax, national life\r\ninsurance, an increasing grip upon the railroads, their finances\r\nand their operation as well as their rates. Each primary resource,\r\nsuch as land and coal and iron and copper and oil, we will more\r\ncarefully conserve. There will be no longer the opportunity for\r\nthe individual along these lines that there has been. Industry\r\nmust find some way of profit-sharing or it will be nationalized.\r\nThese things, however, must be regarded as incidents now; and the\r\nlabor people, those with vision and in authority, are very willing\r\nto postpone the day of accounting until we know what the new order\r\nis to be like.\r\n\r\nWell, I have rambled on, giving you a general look--in on my mind.\r\nDon't let any of those people doubt the President, or doubt the\r\nAmerican people. This is the very darkest day that we have seen.\r\nBut we believe in ourselves and we believe in our own kind, and\r\nbelieve in a something, not ourselves, that makes for\r\nrighteousness,--slowly, stumblingly, but, as the centuries go,\r\nsurely.\r\n\r\nI have not yet seen the Archbishop of York. He has not been here.\r\nBut he has made a most favorable impression where he has been, and\r\nso have the English labor people.\r\n\r\nPoor Spring-Rice did good work here. Washington felt very sad over\r\nhis death, and is expecting that England will evidence her\r\nappreciation of the fact that he did nothing to estrange us by the\r\nway in which his widow is treated.\r\n\r\nReading has been received and fits in perfectly. With warm\r\nregards, as always, Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John Lyon Machine Gun Company Camp McClennen, Alabama\r\n\r\nWashington, March 15,1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--I know how you must feel. Every particle of my own\r\nnature rebels against the horror of this war, or of any war, and\r\nagainst the dragooning by military men. I had rather die now and\r\ntake my chances of Hell, than doom myself and Ned and those who\r\nare to come after, to living under a government which is as this\r\ngovernment is now and as all governments must be now,--autocratic,\r\ngoverned by orders and commands. But this is the game, and we have\r\ngot to play it, play it hard and play it through. Manifestly we\r\ncannot quit as Russia did without getting Russia's ill-fortune.\r\nThere was a great empire of a hundred and eighty million people.\r\nThey mobilized twenty-five million men. Six million of them are\r\ndead. The Czar was overthrown, a new government was set up, one of\r\nconservative socialism, and that was swept aside and a group of\r\nimpractical socialists put in its stead, and where is Russia now?\r\nBroken to bits, its population dying of hunger, its industries\r\nunworked, its soil untilled, and Germany coming on with her great\r\nfeet, stamping down the few who are brave enough to interpose\r\nthemselves between Germany and her end. If we were to quit,\r\nGermany would do to us, or try to do to us, what she has done to\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nIf there ever was a real defensive war it is the one that we are\r\nengaged in, and we must sacrifice, and sacrifice, and sacrifice,\r\nnot merely for the world's sake but for our own sake. Ned is in\r\nFrance. He went through England. He tells me that everybody is\r\nserious, solemn, purposeful. They would rather all die than live\r\nunder Germany's mastery of the world.\r\n\r\nThe President is being bitterly criticized because he has taken\r\nevery opportunity to talk of terms and of ways out, but I think he\r\nis right. He must make the people of the world feel that we are\r\nnot foolishly, and in a headstrong way, fighting to get anything\r\nfor ourselves or for anybody else, except the chance to live our\r\nown lives. And we will show these Germans something. Our capacity\r\nto produce aeroplanes is still altogether unrealized, and we will\r\nhave great guns a few feet apart along the entire front. We can\r\nbomb German harbors where submarines are, and are made--that's\r\nthe work that Ned is going in for,--and we will hold that western\r\nline until every resource is exhausted. And we will go through it\r\none of these days, perhaps not this year. But we must go through\r\nit or else American ships will live on the sea by consent of\r\nGermany, and Canada will become German territory. This is no\r\ndream. Give Germany Paris and Calais and she can exact terms from\r\nEngland. Why should she not ask for Canada? And give Germany\r\nCanada and what becomes of the United States? An army of Germans\r\non our border, 5,000,000 men in arms in the United States always,\r\nthe army and navy budget taking thirty or forty per cent of every\r\nman's income. Who wants to live in such a country? We are fighting\r\nthe greatest war that history has ever seen, not merely in numbers\r\nbut in principle. We are fighting to get rid of the most hateful\r\nsurvivals from the past. The overlord, the brusque and arrogant\r\nsoldier, is the dominating factor in society and the government,\r\nthe turning of men's thoughts away from the pursuit of the things\r\nof art and beauty and social beneficence into the one channel of\r\nmaking everything serve the military arm of the nation.\r\n\r\nThis will be a better world for the poor man when all is over. We\r\nmust forget our dreams, what our own individual lives would have\r\nbeen, and with dash, and cheer, and courage, and willingness to\r\nmake the ultimate sacrifice, set our jaws and go forward. The\r\ndevil is in the saddle and we must pull him down, or else he will\r\nrule the world,--and you are to have a tug at his coat. And I envy\r\nyou. I'd take your place in a minute, if I could. Remember that\r\nyou are an individualist, not a collectivist naturally, but\r\nindividuals are of no use now. The war can be made only by great\r\ngroups who conform. The free spirit of man will have its way once\r\nmore when this bloody war is done.\r\n\r\nI am glad you wrote me, and I want you to feel that you always can\r\nwrite me, whatever is in your heart, and I will give you such\r\nanswer as my busy days will permit. There is only one way to look\r\nat life and get any satisfaction out of it, and that is to bow to\r\nthe inevitable. We all must be fatalists to that extent, and once\r\na course has been determined upon, accept it and make the best of\r\nit. The life of the old gambler does not consist in holding a big\r\nhand but in playing a poor hand well. You and I are no longer\r\nmasters of our own fortunes. All that we can do is to abide by the\r\nset rules of the game that is being played. I would change many\r\nthings, but I am powerless, and because I am powerless I must say\r\nto myself each day, \"All that God demands of me is that I shall do\r\nmy best,\" and doing that, the responsibility is cast upon that\r\nSpirit which is the Great Commander. I like to feel at these times\r\nthat there is a personal God and a personal devil, and there has\r\nbeen no better philosophy devised than that. God is not supreme,\r\nHe is not omnipotent, He has His limitations, His struggles, His\r\ndefeats, but there is no life unless you believe that He\r\nultimately must win, that this world is going upward, not\r\ndownward, that the devil is to be beaten,--the devil inside of\r\nourselves, the devil of wilfulness, of waywardness, of cynicism,\r\nand the devil that is represented by the overbearing, cruel\r\nmilitarism and ruthless inhumanity of Germany. You are a soldier\r\nof the Lord, just as truly as Christ was.\r\n\r\nI send you my affectionate regards, and with it goes the\r\nconfidence that you will, with good cheer and resolution, play\r\nyour part. Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nThis boy died in France. Lane wrote to his father of him:--\r\n\r\nTo Frank Lyon\r\n\r\nWashington, [November 16, 1918]\r\n\r\nDEAR FRANK,--Have just heard. Dear, dear Boy! I was so fond of\r\nhim. He had a brave adventurous spirit. Well, he has gone out\r\ngloriously. There could be no finer way to go and no better time.\r\n\r\nI know your own strength will be equal to this test--and the\r\nwife, poor woman, she too is brave. My heart goes out to you both\r\nvery really, wholly. With much affection.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Miss Genevieve King\r\n\r\nWashington, March 16, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MISS KING,--These are times of terrible strain and stress,\r\nand we cannot easily fall back upon those sources of power which\r\nseem so distant and unavailing. I like to think of you as in our\r\nlast talk in the Millers' drawing room, where you had a much\r\nbetter opportunity to express yourself than in the one that we\r\nlater had out on the porch. You then seemed to live your thought\r\nand to have the capacity for its expression. I think of you, too,\r\nup on that beautiful mountainside, where things like war and guns\r\nand bandages and hospitals and men without arms and the lack of\r\nships, the need for saying goodbye, are so remote.\r\n\r\nWe still keep up a semblance of social life by going to dinners\r\nevery night. It is the one relief I have, and yet each time I go I\r\nfeel ashamed at what appears like a waste of time, and yet I know\r\nis not, and the waste of good food which is needed by others so\r\nmuch more than by us. Still the people have come down to a strict\r\nand modest diet with surprising firmness. There is little evidence\r\nof what you would call luxury or extravagance, excepting in the\r\nway a few people live. The place is filled with soldiers of many\r\ncolors, breeds, and uniforms.\r\n\r\n... Anne is busy every day at her work, and I see little of anyone\r\nwho does not come to me on business. The country seems strongly\r\nwith the President, and while his spirits are not gay, his purpose\r\nis high and his determination is strong. We will do better, and\r\nincreasingly better, as time goes on, I believe. With warm\r\nregards, as always sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLane was a member of the Executive Council of the Red Cross, with\r\nwhom his wife was working during the war. He characterized its\r\nsymbol as,--\"The one flag which binds all nations is that which\r\nspeaks of suffering and healing, losses and hopes, a past of\r\ncourage and a future of peace--the flag of the Red Cross.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John McNaught\r\n\r\nWashington, March 16, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--It is only now after a month's delay, that I have\r\nan opportunity even to acknowledge your letter of the 17th of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\n... The whole war situation seems to be so big that it overwhelms\r\nthe minds of men. ... But we are grinding on and going surely in\r\nthe right way. Not everything has been done that could be done,\r\nbut we are getting our step. This thing will be longer than we\r\nthought. But as the President says, it is our job--our job is cut\r\nout for us, and we are going to see it through. Russia has taught\r\nus what happens to a nation that is not self-respecting. We are\r\nhard at work, every one of us, big and little. The nation never\r\nwas as united, and while we do not realize just what war is, yet\r\nwe will realize it more from day to day and harder will our fibre\r\ngrow.\r\n\r\nMy boy is in France. He hopes to fly an aeroplane over a German\r\nsubmarine base, and drop a ton of dynamite on it and put it out of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nHow the world has changed since we dreamed together in the Cosmos\r\nClub! How Paris has changed since we wandered through its\r\nboulevards together! The day of the common man is at hand. Our\r\ndanger will be in going too fast, and by going too fast do\r\ninjustice to him. But your kind of socialism and mine is to have\r\nits fling.\r\n\r\nI was much pleased to meet your wife, very much indeed, and I hope\r\nwe may see you here one of these days. With my affectionate\r\nregards, sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn May 31, 1918, Lane sent a long letter to President Wilson in\r\nrelation to his plan for providing farms, from the public domain,\r\nfor the returning soldiers. The letter is given at some length,\r\nbecause this plan was so dear to Lane's heart, and was one upon\r\nwhich he had put much earnest study. In addition to the phases of\r\nthe subject printed here, he gave, in his signed letter to\r\nPresident Wilson, detailed consideration to several other aspects\r\nof the matter; such as, a comparison of his plan with land-tenure\r\nin Denmark, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia; the need for an\r\nextension of the method whereby land can be \"developed in large\r\nareas, sub-divided into individual farms, then sold to actual bona\r\nfide farmers on long-time payment basis\"; and also the part Alaska\r\nshould be made to play in affording agricultural opportunity to\r\nour returned soldiers.\r\n\r\nTo Hon. Woodrow Wilson The White House\r\n\r\nWashington, May 31, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--I believe the time has come when we should\r\ngive thought to the preparations of plans for providing\r\nopportunity for our soldiers returning from the war. Because this\r\nDepartment has handled similar problems I consider it my duty to\r\nbring this matter to the attention of yourself and Congress. ...\r\n\r\nTo the great number of returning soldiers, land will offer the\r\ngreat and fundamental opportunity. The experience of wars points\r\nout the lesson that our service men, because of army life with its\r\nopenness and activity, will largely seek out-of-doors vocations\r\nand occupations. This fact is accepted by the allied European\r\nnations. That is why their programs and policies of re-locating\r\nand readjustment emphasize the opportunities on the land for the\r\nreturning soldier. The question then is, \"What land can be made\r\navailable for farm homes for our soldiers?\"\r\n\r\nWe do not have the bountiful public domain of the sixties and\r\nseventies. In a literal sense, for the use of it on a generous\r\nscale for soldier farm homes as in the sixties, \"the public domain\r\nis gone.\" The official figures at the end of the fiscal year, June\r\n30, 1917, show this: We have unappropriated land in the\r\ncontinental United States to the amount of 230,657,755 acres. It\r\nis safe to say that not one-half of this land will ever prove to\r\nbe cultivable in any sense. So we have no lands in any way\r\ncomparable to that in the public domain when Appomattox came--and\r\nmen turned westward with army rifle and \"roll blanket,\" to begin\r\nlife anew.\r\n\r\nWhile we do not have that matchless public domain of '65, we do\r\nhave millions of acres of undeveloped lands that can be made\r\navailable for our home-coming soldiers. We have arid lands in the\r\nWest, cut-over lands in the Northwest, Lake States, and South, and\r\nalso swamp lands in the Middle West and South, which can be made\r\navailable through the proper development. Much of this land can be\r\nmade suitable for farm homes if properly handled. But it will\r\nrequire that each type of land be dealt with in its own particular\r\nfashion. The arid land will require water; the cut-over land will\r\nrequire clearing; and the swamp land must be drained. Without any\r\nof these aids, they remain largely \"No Man's Land.\" The solution\r\nof these problems is no new thing. In the admirable achievement of\r\nthe Reclamation Service in reclamation and drainage we have\r\nabundant proof of what can be done.\r\n\r\nLooking toward the construction of additional projects, I am glad\r\nto say that plans and investigations have been under way for some\r\ntime. A survey and study has been in the course of consummation by\r\nthe Reclamation Service on the Great Colorado Basin. That great\r\nproject, I believe, will appeal to the new spirit of America. It\r\nwould mean the conquest of an empire in the Southwest. It is\r\nbelieved that more than three millions of acres of arid land could\r\nbe reclaimed by the completion of the Upper and Lower Colorado\r\nBasin projects. ...\r\n\r\nWhat amount of land, in its natural state unfit for farm homes,\r\ncan be made suitable for cultivation by drainage, only thorough\r\nsurveys and studies can develop. We know that authentic figures\r\nshow that more than fifteen million acres have been reclaimed for\r\nprofitable farming, most of which lies in the Mississippi River\r\nValley.\r\n\r\nThe amount of cut-over lands in the United States, of course, it\r\nis impossible even in approximation to estimate. ... A rough\r\nestimate of their number is about two hundred million acres--that\r\nis of land suitable for agricultural development. Substantially\r\nall this cut-over or logged-off land is in private ownership. The\r\nfailure of this land to be developed is largely due to inadequate\r\nmethod of approach. Unless a new policy of development is worked\r\nout in cooperation between the Federal Government, the States, and\r\nthe individual owners, a greater part of it will remain unsettled\r\nand uncultivated. ...\r\n\r\nAny plan for the development of land for the returned soldier,\r\nwill come face to face with the fact that a new policy will have\r\nto meet the new conditions. The era of free or cheap land in the\r\nUnited States has passed. We must meet the new conditions of\r\ndeveloping lands in advance--security must to a degree displace\r\nspeculation. ...\r\n\r\nThis is an immediate duty. It will be too late to plan for these\r\nthings when the war is over. Our thought now should be given to\r\nthe problem. And I therefore desire to bring to your mind the\r\nwisdom of immediately supplying the Interior Department with a\r\nsufficient fund with which to make the necessary surveys and\r\nstudies. We should know by the time the war ends, not merely how\r\nmuch arid land can be irrigated, nor how much swamp land\r\nreclaimed, nor where the grazing land is and how many cattle it\r\nwill support, nor how much cut-over land can be cleared, but we\r\nshould know with definiteness where it is practicable to begin new\r\nirrigation projects, what the character of the land is, what the\r\nnature of the improvements needed will be, and what the cost will\r\nbe. We should know also, not in a general way, but with\r\nparticularity, what definite areas of swamp land may be reclaimed,\r\nhow they can be drained, what the cost of the drainage will be,\r\nwhat crops they will raise. We should have in mind specific areas\r\nof grazing lands, with a knowledge of the cattle which are best\r\nadapted to them, and the practicability of supporting a family\r\nupon them. So, too, with our cut-over lands. We should know what\r\nit would cost to pull or \"blow-out\" stumps and to put the lands\r\ninto condition for a farm home.\r\n\r\nAnd all this should be done upon a definite planning basis. We\r\nshould think as carefully of each one of these projects as George\r\nWashington thought of the planning of the City of Washington, We\r\nshould know what it will cost to buy these lands if they are in\r\nprivate hands. In short, at the conclusion of the war the United\r\nStates should be able to say to its returned soldiers, \"If you\r\nwish to go upon a farm, here are a variety of farms of which you\r\nmay take your pick, which the Government has prepared against the\r\ntime of your returning.\" I do not mean by this to carry the\r\nimplication that we should do any other work now than the work of\r\nplanning. A very small sum of money put into the hands of men of\r\nthought, experience, and vision, will give us a program which will\r\nmake us feel entirely confident that we are not to be submerged,\r\nindustrially or otherwise, by labor which we will not be able to\r\nabsorb, or that we would be in a condition where we would show a\r\nlack of respect for those who return as heroes, but who will be\r\nwithout means of immediate self-support.\r\n\r\nA million or two dollars, if appropriated now, will put this work\r\nwell under way.\r\n\r\nThis plan does not contemplate anything like charity to the\r\nsoldier. He is not to be given a bounty. He is not to be made to\r\nfeel that he is a dependent. On the contrary, he is to continue,\r\nin a sense, in the service of the Government. Instead of\r\ndestroying our enemies he is to develop our resources.\r\n\r\nThe work that is to be done, other than the planning, should be\r\ndone by the soldier himself. The dam or the irrigation project\r\nshould be built by him, the canals, the ditches, the breaking of\r\nthe land, and the building of the houses, should, under proper\r\ndirection, be his occupation. He should be allowed to make his own\r\nhome, cared for while he is doing it, and given an interest in the\r\nland for which he can pay through a long period of years, perhaps\r\nthirty or forty years. This same policy can be carried out as to\r\nthe other classes of lands. So that the soldier on his return\r\nwould have an opportunity to make a home for himself, to build a\r\nhome with money which we would advance and which he would repay,\r\nand for the repayment we would have an abundant security. The\r\nfarms should not be turned over as the prairies were--unbroken,\r\nunfenced, without accommodations for men and animals. There should\r\nbe prepared homes, all of which can be constructed by the men\r\nthemselves, and paid for by them, under a system of simple\r\ndevising by which modern methods of finance will be applied to\r\ntheir needs.\r\n\r\nAs I have indicated, this is not a mere Utopian vision. It is,\r\nwith slight variations, a policy which other countries are\r\npursuing successfully. The plan is simple. I will undertake to\r\npresent to the Congress definite projects for the development of\r\nthis country through the use of the returned soldier, by which the\r\nUnited States, lending its credit, may increase its resources and\r\nits population and the happiness of its people, with a cost to\r\nitself of no more than the few hundred thousand dollars that it\r\nwill take to study this problem through competent men. This work\r\nshould not be postponed. Cordially and faithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nThe bill, incorporating this plan, was rejected by a Congress\r\nunwilling to accept any solution of any part of the after-war\r\nproblem, if the plan came from the Wilson Administration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1918, Colonel Mears, who had been Chief Engineer and later\r\nChairman of the Alaskan Commission, in charge of the construction\r\nof the Alaskan railroad, went, with many others, to the front, and\r\nLane was obliged to find new men to carry on the Alaskan work.\r\n\r\nTo Allan Pollok\r\n\r\nWashington, July 17, 1918\r\n\r\nYou certainly can have more time, because I want you, and it is\r\nnot on my own account altogether, because I feel sure you will\r\ndelight in the kind of creative job that it is. I found that\r\nScotchmen had made Hawaii, and I would like to see some of that\r\nsame stuff go into Alaska. You see we have a fine bunch of men\r\nthere, practical fellows of experience, but not one of them looms\r\nlarge as a business man or as a creator. I would personally like\r\nto spend a few years of my life just dreaming dreams about what\r\ncould be done in that huge territory, and if I only got by with\r\none out of five hundred, I would leave a real dent in the history\r\nof the territory.\r\n\r\nThat coal must be brought out of Alaska for the Navy, if the Navy\r\nis going to use any coal, and we ought to be able to send a great\r\nmany thousands of Americans, as stock raisers and farmers, into\r\nAlaska after this war. The climate is just as good as that of\r\nMontana, and in some places much better. Of course it is not a\r\nswivel-chair job. It is a challenge to everything that a fellow\r\nhas in him of ambition, courage, imagination, enterprise, and\r\ntact, and if we can possibly get that road completed by the end of\r\nthe war, and know that we have another national domain there for\r\nsettlement, it would help out mightily on the returning soldier\r\nproblem. You and I cannot fight and that is our bad luck. We were\r\nborn about thirty years too early but I have a notion that we can\r\nmake Alaska do her bit through that railroad. ... If you want a\r\ngreat mining expert to go in with you I can get one. ... Come on\r\ninto the game.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo E. S. Pillsbury\r\n\r\nWashington, July 30, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PILLSBURY,-- ... In these radical times when things\r\nare changing so quickly it does not do to be too conservative or\r\nthings will go altogether to the bad. ...\r\n\r\nPragmatic tests must be applied strictly and the way to beat wild-\r\neyed schemes is to show that they are impracticable, and to\r\nharness our people to the land. Every man in an industry ought to\r\nbe tied up in some way by profit-sharing or stock-owning\r\narrangements, and we should get as large a proportion of our\r\npeople on small farms as possible. If this is not done we are\r\ngoing to have a reign of lawlessness.\r\n\r\nWhen a sense of property goes, it becomes more and more apparent\r\nto me, that all other conserving and conservative tendencies go,\r\nand the man who has something is the man who will save this\r\ncountry. So it is necessary that just as many have something as\r\npossible. ... The one thing which the Bolsheviki do not understand\r\nis that the economic world is not divided between capital and\r\nlabor, but that there is a great class unrepresented in these two\r\ndivisions--the managing class which furnishes brains and\r\ndirection, tact and vision, and no socialistic scheme provides for\r\nthe selection and reward of these men ... Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo William Marion Reedy Reedy's Mirror\r\n\r\nWashington, September 13, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. REEDY,--In the first place ... as to the coal\r\nagreement, when coal was more than six dollars a ton and climbing,\r\nand it was nobody's business to reduce the price, I made an appeal\r\nto the coal operators to fix voluntarily a maximum price of one-\r\nhalf of what they were then getting. This they did, with the\r\nunderstanding that it would stand only until the Government fixed\r\nthe price, if it chose to do so later. The price was three dollars\r\nin the East, and two dollars and seventy-five cents in the West,\r\nand there is not a coal mine in the country to-day, under\r\nGovernment operation, that is producing coal for as little as that\r\nprice, which the operators themselves upon my appeal, fixed ...\r\n\r\nSome day or another we will meet, ... and I am inclined to believe\r\nthat you will think me less of a reactionary than a radical. I am\r\nagainst a standardized world, an ordered, Prussianized world. I am\r\nfor a world in which personal initiative is kept alive and at\r\nwork. There are a lot of people here who believe that you can do\r\nthings by orders, which I know from my knowledge of the human and\r\nthe American spirit can much more effectively be done by appeal.\r\n\r\nEverything goes happily here these days, because we are winning\r\nthe war, and the future of the world will soon be in the hands of\r\na man who not so long ago was a school teacher. A great world\r\nthis, isn't it? And the greatest romance is not even the fact that\r\nWoodrow Wilson is its master, but the advance of the Czecho-Slavs\r\nacross five thousand miles of Russian Asia,--an army on foreign\r\nterritory, without a government, holding not a foot of land, who\r\nare recognized as a nation! This stirs my imagination as I think\r\nnothing in the war has, since Albert of Belgium stood fast at\r\nLiege. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on Cabinet Meetings Found in Lane's Files\r\n\r\nOctober 23, 1918\r\n\r\nYesterday we had a Cabinet Meeting. All were present. The\r\nPresident was manifestly disturbed. For some weeks we have spent\r\nour time at Cabinet meetings largely in telling stories. Even at\r\nthe meeting of a week ago, the day on which the President sent his\r\nreply to Germany--his second Note of the Peace Series--we were\r\ngiven no view of the Note which was already in Lansing's hands and\r\nwas emitted at four o'clock; and had no talk upon it, other than\r\nsome outline given offhand by the President to one of the Cabinet\r\nwho referred to it before the meeting; and for three-quarters of\r\nan hour told stories on the war, and took up small departmental\r\naffairs.\r\n\r\nThis was the Note which gave greatest joy to the people of any yet\r\nwritten, because it was virile and vibrant with determination to\r\nput militarism out of the world. As he sat down at the table the\r\nPresident said that Senator Ashurst had been to see him to\r\nrepresent the bewildered state of mind existing in the Senate.\r\nThey were afraid that he would take Germany's words at their face\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n\"I said to the Senator,\" said the President, \"do they think I am a\r\ndamned fool?\" ... Yet Senator Kellogg says that Ashurst told the\r\nSenators that the President talked most pacifically, as if\r\ninclined to peace, and that Ashurst was \"afraid that he would\r\ncommit the country to peace,\" so afraid that he wanted all the\r\npressure possible brought to bear on the President by other\r\nSenators. At any rate, the Note when it came had no pacificism in\r\nit, and the President gained the unanimous approval of the country\r\nand the Allies.\r\n\r\nBut all this was a week ago. Germany came back with an acceptance\r\nof the President's terms--a superficial acceptance at least--hence\r\nthe appeal to the Cabinet yesterday. This was his opening, \"I do\r\nnot know what to do. I must ask your advice. I may have made a\r\nmistake in not properly safe-guarding what I said before. What do\r\nyou think should be done?\"\r\n\r\nThis general query was followed by a long silence, which I broke\r\nby saying that Germany would do anything he said.\r\n\r\n\"What should I say?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"That we would not treat until Germany was across the Rhine.\"\r\n\r\nThis he thought impossible.\r\n\r\nThen others took a hand. Wilson said the Allies should be\r\nconsulted. Houston thought there was no real reform inside\r\nGermany. McAdoo made a long talk favoring an armistice on terms\r\nfixed by the military authorities. Strangely enough, Burleson, who\r\nhad voted against all our stiff action over the Lusitania and has\r\npleaded for the Germans steadily, was most belligerent in his\r\ntalk. He was ferocious--so much so that I thought he was trying to\r\nmake the President react against any stiff Note--for he knows the\r\nPresident well, and knows that any kind of strong blood-thirsty\r\ntalk drives him into the cellar of pacifism. ...\r\n\r\nOne of the things McAdoo said was that we could not financially\r\nsustain the war for two years. He was for an armistice that would\r\ncompel Germany to keep the peace, military superiority recognized\r\nby Germany, with Foch, Haig, and Pershing right on top of them all\r\nthe time. Secretary Wilson came back with his suggestion that the\r\nAllies be consulted. Then Baker wrote a couple of pages outlining\r\nthe form of such a Note suggesting an armistice. I said that this\r\nshould be sent to our \"partners\" in the war, without giving it to\r\nthe world, that we were in a confidential relation to France and\r\nEngland, that they were in danger of troubles at home, possible\r\nrevolution, and if the President, with his prestige, were to ask\r\npublicly an armistice which they would not think wise to grant, or\r\nwhich couldn't be granted, the sending of such a message into the\r\nworld would be coercing them. The President said that they needed\r\nto be coerced, that they were getting to a point where they were\r\nreaching out for more than they should have in justice. I pointed\r\nout the position in which the President would be if he proposed an\r\narmistice which they (the Allies) would not grant. He said that\r\nthis would be left to their military men, and they would\r\npractically decide the outcome of the war by the terms of the\r\narmistice, which might include leaving all heavy guns behind, and\r\nputting, Metz, Strasburg, etc., in the hands of the Allies, until\r\npeace was declared.\r\n\r\nI suggested that Germany might not know what the President's terms\r\nwere as to Courland, etc., that this was not \"invaded territory.\"\r\nHe replied that they evidently did, as they now were considering\r\nmethods of getting out of the Brest-Litovsk treaty. He said he was\r\nafraid of Bolshevism in Europe, and the Kaiser was needed to keep\r\nit down--to keep some order. He really seemed alarmed that the\r\ntime would come soon when there would be no possibility of saving\r\nGermany from the Germans. This was a new note to me.\r\n\r\nHe asked Secretary Wilson if the press really represented the\r\nsentiment of the country as to unconditional surrender. Wilson\r\nsaid it did. He said that the press was brutal in demanding all\r\nkinds of punishment for the Germans, including the hanging of the\r\nKaiser. At the end of the meeting, which lasted nearly two hours,\r\nhe asked to be relieved of Departmental matters as he was unable\r\nto think longer. I wrote a summary of the position he took, and\r\nread it after Cabinet meeting to Houston and Wilson, who agreed.\r\nIt follows:--\r\n\r\nIf they (the Allies) ask you (the President), \"Are you satisfied\r\nthat we can get terms that will be satisfactory to us without\r\nunconditional surrender?\"\r\n\r\nYou will answer, \"Yes--through the terms of the Armistice.\"\r\n\r\n\"By an armistice can you make sure that all the fourteen\r\npropositions will be effectively sustained, so that militarism and\r\nimperialism will end?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, because we will be masters of the situation and will remain\r\nin a position of supremacy until Germany puts into effect the\r\nfourteen propositions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will that be a lasting peace?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will do everything that can be done without crushing Germany\r\nand wiping her out--everything except to gratify revenge.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNovember 1, 1918\r\n\r\nAt last week's Cabinet we talked of Austria--again we talked like\r\na Cabinet. The President said that he did not know to whom to\r\nreply, as things were breaking up so completely. There was no\r\nAustria-Hungary. Secretary Wilson suggested that, of course, their\r\narmy was still under control of the Empire, and that the answer\r\nwould have to go to it.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the President said, German-Austria should go to\r\nGermany, as all were of one language and one race, but this would\r\nmean the establishment of a great central Roman-Catholic nation\r\nwhich would be under control of the Papacy, and would be\r\nparticularly objectionable to Italy. I said that such an\r\narrangement would mean a Germany on two seas, and would leave the\r\nGermans victors after all. The President read despatches from\r\nEurope on the situation in Germany--the first received in many\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nNothing was said of politics--although things are at a white heat\r\nover the President's appeal to the country to elect a Democratic\r\nCongress. He made a mistake. ... My notion was, and I told him so\r\nat a meeting three or four weeks ago, that the country would give\r\nhim a vote of confidence because it wanted to strengthen his hand.\r\nBut Burleson said that the party wanted a leader with GUTS--this\r\nwas his word and it was a challenge to his (the President's)\r\nvirility, that was at once manifest.\r\n\r\nThe country thinks that the President lowered himself by his\r\nletter, calling for a partisan victory at this time. ... But he\r\nlikes the idea of personal party-leadership--Cabinet\r\nresponsibility is still in his mind. Colonel House's book, Philip\r\nDru, favors it, and all that book has said should be, comes about\r\nslowly, even woman suffrage. The President comes to Philip Dru in\r\nthe end. And yet they say that House has no power. ...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nElection Day. November 5, [1918]\r\n\r\nAt Cabinet some one asked if Germany would accept armistice terms.\r\nThe President said he thought so. ...\r\n\r\nThe President spoke of the Bolsheviki having decided upon a\r\nrevolution in Germany, Hungary, and Switzerland, and that they had\r\nten million dollars ready in Switzerland, besides more money in\r\nSwedish banks held by the Jews from Russia, ready for the campaign\r\nof propaganda. He read a despatch from the French minister in\r\nBerne, to Jusserand, telling of this conspiracy. Houston suggested\r\nthe advisability of stopping it by seizing the money and interning\r\nthe agitators. After some discussion, the President directed\r\nLansing to ask the Governments in Switzerland and Sweden to get\r\nthe men and money, and hold them, and then to notify the Allies of\r\nwhat we had done and suggest that they do likewise. Lansing\r\nsuggested a joint Note, but the President vetoed this idea,\r\nwanting us to take the initiative. He spoke of always having been\r\nsympathetic with Japan in her war with Russia, and thought that\r\nthe latter would have to work out her own salvation. But he was in\r\nfavor of sending food to France, Belgium, Italy, Serbia, Roumania,\r\nand Bulgaria just as soon as possible; and the need was great,\r\nalso in Austria.\r\n\r\nHe said that the terms had been agreed upon, but he did not say\r\nwhat they were--further than to say that the Council at Versailles\r\nhad agreed to his fourteen points, with two reservations:--(1) as\r\nto the meaning of the freedom of the seas, (2) as to the meaning\r\nof the restoration of Belgium and France. This word he had\r\ndirected Lansing to give to the Swiss minister for Germany--and to\r\nnotify Germany also that Foch would talk the terms of armistice.\r\n... He is certainly in splendid humor and in good trim--not\r\nworried a bit. And why should he be, for the world is at his feet,\r\neating out of his hand! No Caesar ever had such a triumph! ...\r\n\r\nNovember 6, 1918\r\n\r\nYesterday we had an election. I had expected we would win because\r\nthe President had made a personal appeal for a vote of confidence,\r\nand all other members of the Cabinet had followed suit, except\r\nBaker who said he wanted to keep the Army out of politics. The\r\nPresident thought it was necessary to make such an appeal. He\r\nliked the idea of personal leadership, and he has received a slap\r\nin the face--for both Houses are in the balance. This is the\r\nculmination of the policy Burleson urged when he got the President\r\nto sign a telegram which he (Burleson) had written opposing\r\nRepresentative Slayden, his personal enemy, from San Antonio, and,\r\nin effect, nominating Burleson's brother-in-law for Congress. We\r\nheard of it by the President bringing it up at Cabinet. Burleson\r\nworked it through Tumulty. The President said that he did not know\r\nwhether to write other letters of a similar nature as to Vardaman,\r\nHardwick, ET AL. I advised against it, saying that the voters had\r\nsense enough to take care of these people. Burleson said, \"The\r\npeople like a leader with guts.\" The word struck the President's\r\nfancy and although Lansing, Houston, and Wilson also protested, in\r\nas strong a manner as any one ever does protest, the letters were\r\nissued. ... Even before the Slayden letter was one endorsing\r\nDavies, in Wisconsin, as against Lenroot. ... Then came the letter\r\nto the people of the whole country, reflecting upon the\r\nRepublicans, saying that they were in great part pro-war but not\r\npro-administration.\r\n\r\nNovember 11, 1918\r\n\r\nOn Sunday I heard that Germany was flying the red flag, and\r\npostponed my promised visit to the Governors of the South, to be\r\nheld at Savannah. At eleven yesterday word came that the President\r\nwould speak to Congress at one, and that he would have no\r\nobjection if the Departments closed to give opportunity for\r\nrejoicings. I went to a meeting of the Council of National Defence\r\nand spoke, welcoming the members. It was a meeting called by\r\nBaruch to plan reconstruction--but the President had notified him\r\non Saturday that he could not talk or have talking on that\r\nsubject. So all I could do was to give a word of greeting to men\r\nwho are bound to be disappointed at being called for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe President's speech was, as always, a splendidly done bit of\r\nwork. He rose to the occasion fully and it was the greatest\r\npossible occasion. ... Lansing says that they (he and the\r\nPresident) had the terms of Armistice before election--terms quite\r\nas drastic as unconditional surrender.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO DANIEL WILLARD PRESIDENT, BALTIMORE AND OHIO RAILROAD\r\n\r\nWashington, November 7, 1918\r\n\r\nDEAR MR. WILLARD,--I am extremely sorry to receive word that you\r\nare leaving us, but of course you are going into a sphere of\r\naction much larger than the one you are in here, and we must yield\r\nyou with every grace, no matter how unwillingly. You will be gone\r\nfrom us only a short time, I trust, and then I shall have the\r\nopportunity of seeing more of you and continuing a friendship\r\nwhich has been of very real value to me.\r\n\r\nAll that you say about the Advisory Commission is true, and more.\r\nIf the history of the Council of National Defence and of the\r\nAdvisory Commission is ever written it will be seen that you\r\ngentlemen, who gave your time and experience freely, gave the\r\nfirst real impulse to war preparation, and we missed out only\r\nbecause we did not have more authority to vest in you. I am very\r\nproud of the first six months of the Council's work and of the\r\nCommission's work.\r\n\r\nI received your letter telling me of the death of your son and\r\ndaughter-in-law, and I did not have the heart to write you another\r\nline. The mystery and the ordering of this world grow altogether\r\ninexplicable when the affections are wrenched. It requires far\r\nmore religion or philosophy than I have, to say a real word that\r\nmight console one who has lost those who are dear to him. Ten\r\nyears ago my mother died, and I have never become reconciled to\r\nher loss. This is a wrong state of mind, and I hope that you are\r\nsustained by that unfaltering trust of which Bryant spoke.\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James H. Hawley\r\n\r\nWashington, November 9, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GOVERNOR,--... To my great surprise we have lost both\r\nHouses. We felt sure that we would carry both, and did not\r\nappreciate the extent to which the Republicans would be\r\nconsolidated by the President's letter, which, from what I hear\r\nwas one of the inducing causes of the result; although not by any\r\nmeans the only one, for the feeling in the North and West was\r\nstrong that the South in some way was being preferred. I am fresh\r\nfrom a talk with Senator Phelan who, to my surprise, tells me that\r\nthese were the factors in the New England States from which he has\r\njust come. ...\r\n\r\nThe Wilson administration may be judged by the great things that\r\nit has done--the unparallelled things--and the election of last\r\nTuesday will get but a line in the history of this period, while\r\nthe Versailles conference and the Fourteen Points of Wilson's\r\nmessage will have books written about them for a century to come.\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Samuel G. Blythe London, England\r\n\r\nWashington, November 13, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR SAM,--I had not seen the review of my little book of\r\nspeeches [Footnote: The American Spirit.] made by the Daily Mail\r\nuntil you sent it to me. I guess we are a nation of idealists and\r\nit won't do any harm to have a little of this leaven thrown into\r\nthe European lump. I am amused when I read the reviews on this\r\nbook to see myself regarded as the rather imaginative interpreter\r\nof the national attitude, after these twenty years of quiet, stiff\r\nlegal opinions on municipal law and rail-road problems.\r\n\r\nGlad to hear of the boy! He is a poor correspondent, as most two-\r\nfisted young chaps are apt to be. I envy you your opportunity now\r\nto see the revolution in Germany, and it? possible spreading\r\nelsewhere. I think you might write an I article on how revolution\r\ncomes to a country; a picture of just how the thing happens; what\r\nthe first step was; what kind of organization there was and how\r\nthey went about their business and got hold of the Government.\r\nThere is I a whole book in this, but immediately there is a chance\r\nfor a couple of mighty interesting articles.\r\n\r\nHere we have gone wild over the victory and peace, and the fact\r\nthat the election went against us means nothing, so far as\r\ninternational questions are concerned. We had not fixed the price\r\non cotton while we had fixed the price on wheat, and that made the\r\nNorth feel that this is a Southern Administration. The Republicans\r\nwere united for the first time in ten years. These are the big\r\nreasons for the shift. You see we have no idea here of Cabinet\r\nresponsibility or votes of confidence or lack of confidence. I\r\nexpect there will be some fun in Congress for the next two years.\r\nAs always, cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, December 16, 1918\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--I have your long letter, telling me of all your\r\nsad experiences with red tape and how you have settled down at\r\nlast to do your bit at home. You have gone through the bitterness\r\nthat most fellows have experienced in trying to do anything with\r\nthe Government. I really am very sorry that you had to make such a\r\nfinancial sacrifice and break up your home and then be fooled, but\r\nprobably it is all for the best. The war is over, the boys are\r\ncoming home soon and this brings me to the main point.\r\n\r\nNed got home this morning. Nancy, Anne, and I went to Norfolk to\r\nmeet him. He had no expectation of seeing us there and at eight\r\no'clock on a very rainy foggy morning, we came up along side of\r\nhis transport and he was taken by surprise. He had a fine lot of\r\nboys with him, but since May he had been at the Naval Aviation\r\nHeadquarters as one of the General Staff.\r\n\r\nHe had many narrow escapes; had men killed standing beside him,\r\ntorn to pieces by shrapnel; was knocked over by the concussion of\r\nshells; was over the lines in the battle of Chateau-Thierry in an\r\naeroplane, flew across the Austrian-Italian lines and chased the\r\nGerman on his retreat through Belgium.\r\n\r\nHe seems to be in good health, though rather nervous. He very much\r\nadmires the men who were his comrades and his superiors, but is\r\nglad to be out of it all. I think he would like to get on a big\r\nfarm. My plan for getting farms for the soldier is making slow\r\nprogress. I have got to put in all my effort now to get some\r\ndecisive answer out of Congress--either yes or no. ...\r\n\r\n[Ned] has seen France very thoroughly, all the north of Italy from\r\nRome up, England, and Ireland. In the latter spot, he was shot at\r\nthree times, notwithstanding a general order that no Irishman is\r\nallowed to have a gun. He was challenged to a duel by a Frenchman\r\nwho tried to get away with his seat in a car. He gave the\r\nFrenchman a good licking and then discovered that he was liable to\r\ncourt martial, but he got the seat and then told the French\r\nlieutenant he would throw him out of the car window if he talked\r\nany more about dueling. The following morning he offered the\r\nFrenchman a cigarette which was taken, and they shook hands and\r\nparted.\r\n\r\nHe went up in an aeroplane in Italy at one place and had a hunch,\r\nhe said, that something was wrong with the machine and so he\r\nbrought it down and landed. Another fellow took it up, an Italian.\r\nHe got up about one thousand feet in the air and the gas tank\r\nexploded. The poor fellow came down burnt to a cinder, all within\r\nfive minutes. He shot a German from the Belgian trenches and has\r\nbeen recommended four times for promotion, but hasn't got it yet.\r\nWith much love to Frances and yourself, I am, affectionately\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EDGAR C. BRADLEY ASSISTANT SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR\r\n\r\nWashington, [December 18, 1918]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BRADLEY,--You wouldn't let me close my sentence yesterday\r\nand I don't propose to close it to-day. Yet I am not going to let\r\nyou drive westward toward the land and people we both love so\r\nmuch, without letting you carry a word of affection and greeting\r\nfrom me, which you can just throw to the winds when you get there,\r\nthrow it out of the window to Tamalpais, it will sweep over those\r\neucalyptus trees on the right, throw it up to the Berkeley hills,\r\nwhich now are turning green, I suppose, throw it up the long\r\nstretch of Market Street till it reaches Twin Peaks, and let it\r\nflow down over \"south of the slot\" that was, and up over Nob Hill,\r\neven to the sacred brownstone of the Pacific-Union.\r\n\r\nGo with a heart that is full of rejoicing that peace has come,\r\nthrough our sacrifice as well as that of other of the nobler\r\npeoples of earth, and with a heart that is proud that you were\r\nable to help with your strength and sane judgment and great\r\ngentleness of speech and manner, in carrying on this nation's\r\naffairs in the day of its greatest adventure. We shall all miss\r\nyou greatly, whether you are gone two weeks or two years! Do just\r\nwhat you think is right, just what she who is so much to you\r\nthinks you should do. There is no better test of a man's duty.\r\n\r\nIf you can't return we shall stagger on. I shan't stop climbing\r\nthis ladder because a rung is gone--tho' many a rung is gone--and\r\na damn hard old ladder this is sometimes. ...\r\n\r\nF.K.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nAFTER-WAR PROBLEMS--LEAVING WASHINGTON\r\n\r\n1919\r\n\r\nAfter-war Problems--Roosevelt Memorials--Americanization--Religion\r\n--Responsibility of Press--Resignation\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. C. BRADLEY\r\n\r\nWashington, January, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BRADLEY,-- ... I am terribly broken up over Roosevelt's\r\ndeath. He was a great and a good man, a man's man, always playing\r\nhis game in the open. ...\r\n\r\nI loved old Roosevelt because he was a hearty, two-fisted fellow.\r\n... The only fault I ever had to find with him was that he took\r\ndefeat too hard. He had a sort of \"divine right\" idea, but he was\r\na bully fighter. I went to his funeral and have joined in mass\r\nmeetings in his memory, which I suppose is all I can do. ... Of\r\ncourse ... he said a lot of things that were unjust and\r\nunjustifiable, but if a fellow doesn't make a damned fool of\r\nhimself once in a while he wouldn't be human. The Republicans\r\nwould have nominated him next time undoubtedly. They are without a\r\nleader now, and we are just as much up in the air as ever. ... I\r\nam standing by the President for all I am worth. I talked to the\r\nMerchants' Association the other day and gave him a great send-\r\noff, but they didn't rise to their feet at all, which is the first\r\ntime this has happened in two years. ... Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, January 30, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,-- ... The one thing that bothers us here is the\r\nproblem of unemployment. We have not, of course, had time to turn\r\naround and develop any plan for reconstruction. Our whole war\r\nmachine went to pieces in a night. Everybody who was doing war\r\nwork dropped his job with the thought of Paris in his mind, with\r\nthe result that everything has come down with a crash, in the way\r\nof production, but nothing in the way of wages or living costs.\r\nWages cannot go down until the cost of living does, and production\r\nwon't increase while people believe prices will be lower later on.\r\nI to-day proposed to Secretary Glass that he enter upon a campaign\r\nto promote production, (1) by seeing what the Government could\r\nbuy, (2) by seeing what the industries would take as a bottom\r\nprice, (3) by getting the Food Administration at work to reduce\r\nprices. Perhaps it may do some good. ...\r\n\r\nI have always thought the President was right in going across, and\r\nI believe that he will pull through a League of Nations. When I\r\nget a copy of it I will send you my speech on this subject, which\r\nis rather loose but is a plea for dreams.\r\n\r\nNed is going West to. work for Doheny in some oil field, starting\r\nat the bottom. I rather think this is right, but of course he\r\nwon't stay as a laborer very long. The boy is fine and gay, and\r\ndid splendid work, and is anxious to get into the game and make\r\nmoney. Just where he gets this desire for making money I don't\r\nknow. Certainly I never had it. But he was telling me the other\r\nday of his hope that by forty he would have made enough money to\r\nretire. I told him you were the only fellow I ever knew who had\r\nactually retired, and you had only done it half way. He will\r\nreport at Los Angeles, but I expect he will get up to see you as\r\nsoon as he can. He has a remarkable affection for California,\r\nconsidering he has seen so little of it, and so has Nancy. They\r\nboth regard it as the golden land where all things smile, and\r\npeople have hearts. I have not attempted to cure them of their\r\nillusion.\r\n\r\nDo write me a good, long letter, for I am always eager to hear\r\nfrom you.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo George W. Lane\r\n\r\nWashington, May 1, [1919]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--Well, what do you think of the Italian situation?\r\nI think the President right, that Fiume should not go to Italy.\r\nCertainly she has no moral claim, for by the Pact of London, Fiume\r\nwas to go to Croatia. Orlando says that he is answering the call\r\nof the Italians in exile. Let them stay in exile, I say. They went\r\ninto a foreign land to make money and now they wish to annex the\r\nland they are visiting, to the home country. How would we like it\r\nif the Chinese swamped San Francisco and then asked to be annexed\r\nto China? This is carrying the Fiume idea to its ultimate, a\r\nridiculous ultimate, of course, as most ultimates are.\r\n\r\nWhether he [President Wilson] gave out the statement as to the\r\nbreak too early, and without the consent of England and France, of\r\ncourse I don't know. Quite like him to do it if he thought the\r\nthing had hung long enough, and that Italy was too damn predatory.\r\nAnd she does seem to be. The New Idea seems to have less real hold\r\nin Italy--at least among the governing class--than in any other\r\nEuropean country. Her present position will postpone peace. This\r\nwill cause us trouble over the extra session of Congress for our\r\nappropriations will run out. And perhaps in England it may give a\r\nchance for labor troubles to rise. It will postpone the return of\r\ngood times to this country. But ultimately Italy will have to come\r\nthrough. If economic pressure were put upon her she would be\r\ncompelled to yield at once, for she depends on England and\r\nourselves for all the coal she uses, and on us chiefly for her\r\nwheat. Of course this form of coercion will not be resorted to.\r\nShe might think more kindly if she were given an extended credit,\r\nsay of two hundred million dollars. But the people being aroused\r\nnow over what they think is a matter of principle--loyalty to\r\ntheir compatriots in Fiume--they may not be able to compromise.\r\nLord Reading rather fears that this is the situation and that it\r\nmight have been avoided if the President had not issued his\r\nstatement when he did. However, I have no doubt that the President\r\nwill have his way. He nearly always does. Surely the God that once\r\nwas the Kaiser's is now his.\r\n\r\nTo be the First President of the League of Nations is to be the\r\ncrowning glory of his life. I believe in the League--as an\r\neffort. It will not cure, but it is a serious effort to get at the\r\ndisease. It is a hopeful effort, too, for it makes moral\r\nstandards, standards of conduct between nations which will bring\r\nconventional pressure to bear on the side of peace, to offset the\r\nold convention of rushing into war to satisfy hurt feelings.\r\nSooner or later there will come disarmament--the pistol will be\r\ntaken away and the streets will be safer.\r\n\r\nThe boy is having a tough time in his oil work. It is so dirty!\r\nBut I hope he sticks out until he proves himself. I hear that the\r\nDutch Shell people have bought out Cowdray in Mexico, and now are\r\ntrying to get Doheny's lands. They bestride the earth, and as soon\r\nas their activities are known generally, this country will look\r\nupon the Standard Oil as the American champion in a big\r\ninternational fight.\r\n\r\n... Well, dear old chap, I know that I could add nothing to your\r\ncure if I were there but I am not content to be so far away from\r\nyou. ... F. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM BOYCE THOMPSON ROOSEVELT PERMANENT MEMORIAL NATIONAL\r\nCOMMITTEE\r\n\r\nWashington, May 20, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. THOMPSON,--I told Mr. Loeb that I would feel greatly\r\nhonored to be a member of a Memorial Committee, to do honor to Ex-\r\nPresident Roosevelt. To-day, I receive an agreement which I am\r\nasked to sign in which the members of the Committee are to pledge\r\nthemselves to a memorial for the furtherance of Mr. Roosevelt's\r\npolicies. I do not know what such a phrase means. With some of his\r\npolicies I know I was in hearty accord but as to others, such as\r\nthe tariff, I have my doubts. This might be turned or construed\r\ninto a great machine for propaganda of a partisan character, and\r\nit seems to me that the Colonel's memory is altogether too\r\nprecious a national possession to have that construction possibly\r\ngiven to any memorial to him.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of thousands of Democrats, like myself, who\r\nadmired him and who would contribute toward a memorial, who should\r\nnot be asked to do this if it was any more than a straight-out\r\nmemorial to the man, the soldier, the naturalist, the historian,\r\nthe President, the intense, vital American.\r\n\r\nAnd all of your officers, so far as I am acquainted with them, are\r\nRepublicans. This does not seem to convey quite the right\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nI have already planned for a lasting Roosevelt memorial in the\r\ncreation of a park in California, to bear Colonel Roosevelt's\r\nname. I expect this will have Congressional approval at the\r\npresent session of Congress.\r\n\r\nLast night I talked with Senator Frank Kellogg about this matter,\r\nand he agrees with my view. He says that he understood the\r\nmemorial was to be something in Washington of a permanent and\r\nartistic character, and perhaps the home at Oyster Bay, and that\r\nthe personnel of all committees was to be popular, including if\r\npossible as many Democrats as Republicans.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances I beg leave to withhold my signature to\r\nthe agreement sent me. I would have no objection to asking\r\nCongress to provide for a memorial, though I think this should be\r\ndeferred as a matter of policy until the public had subscribed\r\ngenerously. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER PRESIDENT EMERITUS, UNIVERSITY OF\r\nCALIFORNIA\r\n\r\nWashington, June 16, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR WHEELER,--I have seen your goodbye address at Berkeley,\r\nand I am very glad I did not hear it, for it must have been a sad\r\nday for Berkeley and for you. The address itself was a noble word.\r\nI hear that you have bought Lucy Sprague's home and are to remain\r\nin Berkeley. This is as it should be. You can ripen into the Sage\r\nof Berkeley, and be a center of influence, stimulating the best in\r\nothers. A long, long life to you! Always sincerely and devotedly\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K, LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO E. S. MARTIN LIFE\r\n\r\nWashington, August 23, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. MARTIN,-- ... It does not seem to me that this country\r\nwill rise to a class war. We have too many farmers and small\r\nhouseholders and women--put the accent on the women. They are the\r\nconservatives. Until a woman is starving, she does not grow Red,\r\nunless she is without a husband or babies and has a lot of money\r\nthat she did not earn. ... Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, September 11, 1919\r\n\r\nDEAR GEORGE,--You do not know how much of sympathy I send out to\r\nyou and how many words of prayer I send up for you. You need them\r\nall, I expect. ... What a long siege you have had!\r\n\r\nI suppose you will not be able to hear the President speak when he\r\nis there. You will miss much. He is not impassioned nor a great\r\norator, such as Chatham or Fox, or Webster or Dolliver, or even\r\nBryan--but he has a keen, quick, cutting mind, the mind of a\r\nreally great critic, and his manner is that of the gentleman\r\nscholar. He is first among all men to-day, which is much for\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nMy Nancy has been having a splendid time, even if she only saw\r\nyour ranch for a week--but she is the gayest thing alive--God\r\ngrant she may continue so always. ...\r\n\r\nFor the first time in twenty-five years we are living in an\r\napartment, large and in a nice place, but somehow my sense of the\r\nfitness of things will not let me call the place \"home\"--altho' it\r\nis the most comfortable habitation I have ever lived in, elevator,\r\nwhole floor to ourselves. ... and they let me keep my dog. I\r\nwouldn't have come if they hadn't. We turned down a fine place\r\nwith a more expansive view because Jack was not wanted. But surely\r\nin these days of doubt and disloyalty one must have some rock to\r\ncling to, why not a trusting-eyed dog? ... But all this does not\r\nrecompense me for the absence of a \"home\"--which is a house,\r\nanywhere. Yet we may have to do our own work. ... The cooks are\r\nall too proud to work--I wish you would tell me just how this\r\neconomic problem should be settled. How much do you believe in\r\nsocialism or socialization? ... Do you think there can be a\r\npartnership in business? I am inclined to think this can be worked\r\nout, along lines of cooperative ownership, but not until an\r\nenterprise is well standardized.\r\n\r\nI expect bad times soon with labor. We are only postponing the\r\nevil day. The President seems less radical than he was. He is\r\nsobered by conditions, I suspect. The negro is a danger that you\r\ndo not have. Turn him loose and he is a wild man. Every Southerner\r\nfears him.\r\n\r\n... I am trying hard to believe something that might be called the\r\nshadow of a religion--a God that has a good purpose, and another\r\nlife in which there is a chance for further growth, if not for\r\nglory. But when I bump up against a series of afflictions such as\r\nyou have been subjected to, I fall back upon Fred's philosophy of\r\na purposeless or else a cruel God. ... I simply have a sinking of\r\nthe heart, a goneness, a hopelessness--not even the pleasure of a\r\nresignation. Old Sid's cold mind has worked itself through to a\r\ndecision that there is no purpose and no future, and finds solace\r\nin the ultimate; having reached the cellar he finds the\r\nsatisfaction of rest. I can't get there for my buoyancy, the hold-\r\nover of early teachings or perhaps my naturally sanguine nature\r\nwill not permit me to hit bottom, but forever I must be floating,\r\nfloating--nowhere. Happy the man who strikes the certainty of a\r\nrock-bottom hell, rather than one who is kept floating midway--\r\nthat is a purgatory worse than hell. I don't seem to have any\r\ncapacity for anger, as against God or man, for anything that\r\nbefalls me, but I get morbid over the injustices done to others.\r\nNow I shall stop philosophizing on this matter for it is three in\r\nthe morning, and too hot to sleep, and such a time is made for\r\nwickedness and not for righteousness.\r\n\r\nI am sorry you will not see the President. He is worth hearing,\r\nbetter than reading, and he always talks well. He can not pass his\r\ntreaty without some kind of reservations and he should have seen\r\nthis a month ago. The Republicans will not struggle to pass it in\r\nhis absence and think that they have done a smart thing, but in\r\nthe end Wilson and not Lodge would win by such a trick. The one\r\ngreatest of vices is smart-aleckism. Sometime I shall write an\r\nessay on that subject. The burglar and the confidence operator and\r\nthe profiteer and the profligate and the defaulting bank cashier\r\nare all victims of that disease--smart-aleckism. They will do a\r\ntrick, to prove how clever they are. I believe that is the way\r\nninety per cent of the boys and girls go wrong, and instead of\r\nteaching them the Bible, why not try reducing the size of their\r\nconceit and their disposition to boast. I just wonder how far\r\nwrong I am on this?\r\n\r\n... Don't let the family worry you. Call for the police if they\r\ndon't let you have your own way. ... What a plague of women! But\r\nhow did monks manage to live anyhow? Maybe they chose a hard\r\ndeath--perhaps that was the secret of the whole monkery game!\r\nWomen let us down into the grave with much unction to our ego, I\r\nmean sweet oil of adoration ... poured out upon the way down to\r\nAvernus. ... Don't feel discouraged because you lie there. I feel\r\nmuch more discontented than you do, right here at the heart of the\r\nworld. ... Love to Maude and Frances, and mention me with proper\r\nrespect and dignity to Miss Nancy Lane.\r\n\r\nF. K.\r\n\r\nTO VAN H. MANNING DIRECTOR, BUREAU OF MINES\r\n\r\nWashington, September 24, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. MANNING,--I have been intending for several days to\r\nwrite you a letter regarding the Petroleum Institute, but the\r\nopportunity has been denied me. Perhaps you will be good enough to\r\nsay to the gentlemen, whom I understand you are to meet tomorrow,\r\nthat I regard their work, if taken hold of whole-heartedly, as of\r\nthe greatest national importance. It is quite manifest now that\r\nprivate enterprise must stand in the forefront in the development\r\nof this industry, and that what the government can do will be\r\nsupplemental and suggestive. It is not an exaggeration to say that\r\nmillions of dollars must be spent in experiment before we know the\r\nmany services to which a barrel of oil can be put. There is almost\r\nan indefinite opportunity for research work along this line.\r\n\r\nPetroleum is a challenge to the chemists of the world. And now the\r\nworld is dependent upon it, as it is upon nothing else excepting\r\ncoal and iron, and the foodstuffs and textiles. It has jumped to\r\nthis place of eminence within twenty years, and the world is\r\nconcerned in knowing how large a supply there is and how every\r\ndrop of it can best be used. Practically, I think you should urge\r\nthat there be cooperative effort to protect against waste. The oil\r\nmen themselves should see the value of this and spend their money\r\nfreely to keep their wells from being flooded, to keep their pipe\r\nlines from leaking, and to save their gas.\r\n\r\nWe are behind the rest of the world in the use of our oil for fuel\r\npurposes. We are spendthrifts in this as in other of our national\r\nresources. We can get three times as much energy as we do out of\r\nour oil through the use of the Diesel engine, yet we are doing\r\nlittle to promote development of a satisfactory type of stationary\r\nDiesel, or marine design. Instead of seeing how many hundred\r\nmillions of barrels of oil we can produce and use, our effort\r\nshould be to see how few millions of barrels will satisfy our\r\nneeds. I say this although I am not a pessimist as to the\r\navailable supply, which I believe has been underestimated rather\r\nthan overestimated. I am satisfied that the man who has a barrel\r\nof oil has something which, if he can save, is better than a\r\ngovernment bond. Throughout the Nation we must make a drive to\r\nincrease production--that is the slogan of this time--but that\r\ndoes not mean that we should make a drive to exhaust resources\r\nwhich God alone can duplicate.\r\n\r\nThen too, I think that Congress can be largely helped by the sane\r\npresentation of wise policies touching this industry. I have the\r\nbelief that whatever the body of oil men would agree upon would be\r\nsomething that would make for the best use of petroleum, and for\r\nthe protection over a long period of this fundamental resource in\r\nour industry. Congress has difficulty often in getting the large\r\nview of practical men who speak without personal interest, and\r\nsuch an Institute could speak not for the individual but for the\r\nindustry and show how it may best be developed in the interest of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nTo do these things, and to do them adequately, will require the\r\nmen in the industry to take the attitude of statesmen and not of\r\nselfish exploiters. It means they must tax themselves liberally,\r\ngenerously. It means that they must think of themselves as\r\ntrustees for a Public as wide as the world.\r\n\r\nPlease give my regards to the members of the Institute. Cordially\r\nyours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTO E. C. BRADLEY\r\n\r\nWashington, October 2, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR BRADLEY,-- ... I have all along said that the treaty could\r\nnot be ratified without some interpretive reservations. I think\r\nthat the President will see that, although he sees clearly, as I\r\ndo, that these interpretations are already in the treaty itself,\r\nbut on a question of construction two men may honestly differ. The\r\nwhole damn thing has gotten into the maelstrom of politics, of the\r\nnastiest partisanship, when it ought to have been lifted up into\r\nthe clearer air of good sense and national dignity. ...\r\n\r\nHoover can be elected. He came home modestly and made a splendid\r\nspeech. We need a man of great administrative ability and of\r\nsupreme sanity who can lead us into quiet waters, if there are\r\nany.\r\n\r\n... We have imported, with our labor, their discontent, and the\r\ntheories which are founded upon it to obtain the price. But the\r\nAmerican workingman is a sensible fellow, when he can have the\r\nchance to think without being overwhelmed by fear, and he will\r\nrealize that his betterment in a material way must come through\r\nhis own individual growth and the growth of the conscience of the\r\npeople who believe in a square deal. The serious thing in the\r\nwhole situation, to my mind, is the fact that so many workingmen\r\nseem to accept the idea that they are of a fixed class; that they\r\ncan not move out of their present conditions; that they want\r\nalways to remain as employees and have no hope of becoming\r\nsuperintendents, employers, managers, or capitalists; and\r\ntherefore think that their only prospect is in bettering their\r\ncondition as a part of a class. Great propaganda should be carried\r\non to show how false this is and how much demand there is for men\r\nof ability.\r\n\r\nWith warm regards, old man, I am cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTO MRS. LOUISE HERRICK WALL\r\n\r\nWashington, Friday, [October 10, 1919]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MRS. WALL,--We heard through Ned of the Commodore's death,\r\nand you can realize how shocked and terribly grieved we were, and\r\nstill are.\r\n\r\nPoor dear girl, there is nothing anyone can say that will help\r\neven a little bit. Every word of appreciation makes the loss more\r\nserious. And you need no one to tell you that he was loved by us,\r\nand every single person who really knew him. He was to me\r\nChristlike, beautiful, gentle, wise and noble. Since that first\r\nday, nearly thirty years ago on Grays Harbor, I have known him as\r\none of the rare spirits of the world, and Anne and I have loved\r\nhim deeply. Surely he must live on, and we must all see him again!\r\n\r\nMay strength come to you out of the Infinite resources of the\r\nUniverse to bear this blow. The world was made better by him! In\r\ndeep sympathy,\r\n\r\nFRANK LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO--\r\n\r\nWednesday, November, [1919]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR OLD MAN,--I am sitting alone in my den having come down\r\nstairs to write a line on my report, but instead have been lured\r\ninto an evening of delight with Robert Louis Stevenson, whose\r\nletters, in four volumes, I advise you to read for the spirit of\r\nthe man. Much like your own, my brave fine fellow! He went through\r\ntortures with a smile and a merry imagination which made him\r\ngreat, and makes all of us, and many more to come, his debtor. I\r\nknow how little you read. The birds have been yours and the trees\r\nand the dogs and fishes, but there are men in the world, or have\r\nbeen, whom one can know through their writings. Did you ever read\r\nTrevelyan's three volumes on GARIBALDI? No,--well get it before\r\nyou are a week older and you will thank me for ever and a day.\r\n\r\nAll of this, however, I had not intended to write, rather to tell\r\nyou ... how emotional I have been all day with the old soldiers\r\npassing by on parade--the last that many of them will ever have.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago, Andrew Johnson received Grant's returned forces\r\non the same spot. There were 180,000, or so, then--and 20,000 now\r\n--crippled, lame, one-legged, bent, halting most of them, but\r\ndetermined to make the long journey from the Capitol to the White\r\nHouse, and prove that they had lived this long time and were still\r\ngood for a longer journey. There was little of gaiety among them,\r\ntho' some were swinging flags, torn, tattered, be-shot ... and\r\nraised their hats to the President as they passed, tho' most of\r\nthem, doubtless, were sorry that he was not a Republican. It was a\r\ntime to remember.\r\n\r\n... Nancy is back after her tour of glory--larger than ever but\r\nnot less tender or playful. She is the brightest spirit I have\r\never met--and all her vanities are so dear and human and lie so\r\nfrankly exposed. I thank you for your kindness to her, she loves\r\nyou very much; yes, really recognizes those qualities which some\r\ncannot see, poor blind things! But I can, and she can, and Frances\r\ncan, and many more when you give them a look in. May your grass\r\ngrow and soul keep warm and your spirit lift itself in song at\r\nmorning and at night. Affectionately always,\r\n\r\nF.L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO M. A. MATHEW\r\n\r\nWashington, November 3, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. MATHEW,--I have your letter of October 27th, and I\r\nappreciate very much its kind words. The Industrial Conference was\r\nnot a success because we got into the steel strike at first, and\r\npeople talked about their rights instead of talking of their\r\nduties. We will have another conference, however, which I think\r\nwill do some real work and lay a foundation for the future. The\r\ncoal strike is a bad one, but the people are not in sympathy with\r\nit, and sooner or later, in my judgment, it will come to an\r\nadjustment situation in which the President will be perfectly\r\nwilling to participate. He, by the way, is getting along very\r\nwell, but I expect it will be many weeks before he is himself\r\nagain. ... Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HERBERT C. PELL, JR. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nWashington, November 8, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PELL,--I wish you success with your Constitutional\r\nLeague. I have no objection whatever to my name being used in\r\nconnection with it, providing the League is not an institution for\r\ndenouncing people or denouncing theories of government or economic\r\npanaceas; but is a positive, aggressive institution for the\r\npresentation to our people of the fact that we have in this\r\nDemocracy a method of doing whatever we wish done, which avoids\r\nthe necessity for anything like revolutionary action. The\r\nobjection to Bolshevism is that it is absolutism--as Lenine has\r\nsaid himself, the absolutism of the proletariat. It is an economic\r\ngovernment by force, while our Democracy is a government by\r\npersuasion.\r\n\r\nI find that no good comes from calling names. The men who are to\r\nbe reached are the men who are not committed against us, but are\r\ndisposed to be with American institutions. We must show them that\r\nwe have a system that it is worth while betting on, and that if\r\nthey have another way of doing things economical, machinery by\r\nwhich it can be instituted is in the people's hands. Our policy is\r\nto look before we leap, and to submit our methods to the judicial\r\njudgment of the people. This permits any doctrine to be preached\r\nthat does not subvert our institutions. Where do our institutions\r\ncome from? What have they been effective in bringing about? What\r\nis the condition of the United States as a whole compared with\r\nother countries? Can we hope to work out our salvation without\r\ncivil war? These are legitimate questions, the answer to which is\r\nfound in this other question--is not political Democracy the one\r\npractical way to eventual industrial Democracy? Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HENRY P. DAVISON\r\n\r\nWashington, November 23, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. DAVISON,--I wired you yesterday my conclusion, as to\r\nyour very generous and patriotic offer, which was the same that I\r\nhad come to before seeing you in New York. Your appeal was so\r\nstrong and went so much to my impulse for public service that you\r\nmade me feel that, perhaps, I was giving undue weight to the\r\nconsiderations I had presented to you. So I sought the judgment of\r\nothers--all of them men of large distinction whom you know, or at\r\nleast have confidence in, and without dissent I found them saying,\r\nvoluntarily and unbidden, what I had said to you--that for me to\r\nundertake this work of arousing the best patriotic feeling of\r\nAmerica, on a salary, would make seriously against the success of\r\nthe work and against my own value in it, or in anything else I\r\nmight undertake. If I were rich I would go into it with my whole\r\nheart. But a poor man can not be charged with making money out of\r\nthe exploitation of the good opinion others have of his love of\r\ncountry. This is not squeamishness, it is a rough standard,\r\narrived at by instinct rather than by any refined process of\r\nreasoning.\r\n\r\nI say this to you because of my deep confidence in you and my very\r\nreal confidence that you are my friend, and sought to do me a\r\nkindness and give me an opportunity. Now let me see if I can be of\r\nany help in this work. ...\r\n\r\n[Here followed a full detailed plan of an Americanization program,\r\nthat concluded with the paragraph.]\r\n\r\nThese outline some methods of reaching the public with the idea\r\nthat this is a land that is lovable, prosperous, good-humored,\r\ngreat, and noble-spirited. To carry it out will cost a great deal\r\nof money, I should say that not less than five million a year\r\nshould be available. With warm regard, cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. LANE\r\n\r\nWashington, November 28, [1919]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--Do not be surprised if you hear that I am out of\r\nthe Cabinet soon, for I have been offered two fifty thousand a\r\nyear places, and another even more. I don't want to leave if it\r\nwill embarrass the President, but I do want something with a\r\nlittle money in it for awhile. ... But I must see the President\r\nbefore I decide ... and I don't know when that will be, now that\r\nhe is sick.\r\n\r\nThis life has a great fascination for everyone and I dread to\r\nleave it; for anything else will bore me I am sure. I deal here\r\nonly with big questions and not with details--with policies that\r\naffect many, and yet I have but a year and a half more, and then\r\nwhat? Perhaps it is as well to take time by the forelock, tho' I\r\ndo not want to decide selfishly nor for money only. I must go\r\nwhere I can feel that I am in public work of some kind. ...\r\n\r\n... I have served him [the President] long and faithfully under\r\nvery adverse circumstances. It is hard for him to get on with\r\nanyone who has any will or independent judgment. Yet I am not\r\ngiven to forsaking those to whom I have any duty. However we shall\r\nsee, I write you this, that you may not be misled by the thought\r\nthat there has been or is any friction. Of course you won't speak\r\nof it to anyone.\r\n\r\nI am so glad you are able to be out a little bit. \"Ain't it a\r\nglorious feelin'?\" The farm must look mighty good. Well, old man,\r\ngoodnight, and God give you your eyes back! With my warmest love,\r\n\r\nFRANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO C. S. JACKSON OREGON JOURNAL\r\n\r\nWashington, December 29, 1919 MY DEAR SAM,--I hear from Joe Teal\r\nthat your boy has been lost at sea, and I write this word, not in\r\nthe hope that I can say anything that will minimize your loss, for\r\nall the kindly words of all men in all the world could not do as\r\nmuch as one faint smile from that boy's lips could do to bring a\r\nbit of joy into your heart.\r\n\r\nBut you are an old, old friend of mine. It is more than thirty\r\nyears since we dreamed a dream together which you were able to\r\nrealize. We both have had our fortune in good and bad, and on the\r\nwhole I think our lives have not added to the misery of men, but\r\nhave done something toward making life a bit more kind for many\r\npeople. And why should that boy be taken from you? There is the\r\nmystery--if you can solve it you can solve all the other\r\nmysteries. I hope you have some good staunch faith, which I have\r\nnever been able to get, that would enable me to look upon these\r\nthings in humility, in the confidence that this thing we call a\r\nbody is only a temporary envelope for a permanent thing--a\r\nlasting, growing thing called a spirit, the only thing that\r\ncounts. If we can get that sense we can have a new world. I do not\r\nbelieve we will change this world much for the good out of any\r\nmaterialistic philosophy or by any shifting of economic affairs.\r\nWe need a revival--a belief in something bigger than ourselves,\r\nand more lasting than the world.\r\n\r\nWith my warmest sympathy, I am, yours as always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN CRAWFORD BURNS\r\n\r\nWashington, December 29, [1919]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--The manner in which you write assures me that you\r\nare very happy, notwithstanding your marriage and your new\r\nreligion, for which I am glad. An even better assurance is the\r\npicture of the bride. By what wizardry have you been able to lure\r\nand capture so young, good, and intelligent-looking a girl? I\r\npresume she was fascinated by the indirectness of your speech, the\r\ntouches of humor and your very stern manner. John, you are a\r\nhumbug, you have made that aloofness and high indifference a\r\nwinning asset. I shan't give you away. Only you fill me with a\r\nmortifying envy.\r\n\r\nAs for your religion, various of your friends think it odd. I\r\nthink that you are a subject for real congratulation. A man who\r\ncan believe anything is miles ahead of the rest of us. I would\r\ngladly take Christian Science, Mohammedanism, the Holy Rollers or\r\nanything else that promised some answer to the perplexing\r\nproblems. But you have been able to go into the Holy of Holies and\r\nsit down on the same bench of belief with most of the saints--this\r\nis miraculous good fortune. I mean it. I am not scoffing or\r\njeering. I never was more serious.\r\n\r\nThis whole damned world is damned because it is standing in a bog,\r\nthere is no sure ground under anyone's feet. We are the grossest\r\nmaterialists because we only know our bellies and our backs. We\r\nworship the great god Comfort. We don't think; we get sensations.\r\nThe thrill is the thing. All the newspapers, theatres, prove it.\r\nWe resign ourselves to a life that knows no part of man but his\r\nnerves. We study \"reactions,\" in human beings and in chemistry--\r\nrecognizing no difference between the two--and to my great\r\namazement, the war has made the whole thing worse than ever. John,\r\nif you have a religion that can get hold of people, grip them and\r\nlift them--for God's sake come over and help us. I know you can\r\nunderstand how people become Bolsheviks just out of a desire for\r\ndefiniteness and leadership. The world will not move forward by\r\nfloating on a sea of experimentation. It gets there by believing\r\nin precise things, even when they are only one-tenth true. I wish\r\nI had your faith--as a living, moving spirit. Some day I pray that\r\nI may get with you where you can tell me more of it and how you\r\ngot it.\r\n\r\nI am leaving the Cabinet, tho' the precise date no one knows, for\r\nthe President is not yet well enough to talk about it. He seems to\r\nbe too done up to stand any strain or worry. But I must have some\r\nmoney, for my years are not many, Anne is far from well, and Nancy\r\nis a young lady, and a very beautiful one. She has just come out\r\nand is quite the belle of the season, tho' like her father, too\r\nanxious for popularity.\r\n\r\nGreat good luck of all kinds to you in 1920, old man--and do give\r\nme a line now and then.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRANK I. COBB NEW YORK WORLD\r\n\r\nWashington, [1919]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FRANK,--I have read your speech on Prussianizing the\r\nAmericans, and I concur. Of course repression ... promotes the\r\ngrowth of error. We are not going to destroy socialism, or prevent\r\nit from coming strong by refusing to answer it.\r\n\r\nBut I have a notion that you have not expressed as directly as I\r\nshould like:--That the newspaper is not influential enough to stop\r\nit and perhaps does not care to, sometimes. Where are the papers\r\nthat are respected for their character? They are few. The most of\r\nthem are believed to be the allies of every kind of Satan. \"They\r\nare rich; their ads. run them; they pander to circulation, no\r\nmatter of what kind, to get ads.\", that is the answer of the plain\r\npeople. If the papers were things of thought and not of passion,\r\nprejudice and sensation and interest, they could do the work that\r\npolice and courts are called upon to do. They could effectively\r\nanswer the agitator. But the people do not believe them when they\r\ncry aloud. Maybe I am wrong, but isn't there a grain, or a gram,\r\nof truth in this?\r\n\r\nFor a year and a half I have been bombarding Congress with a\r\ndemand for a bill that would make a campaign, through the schools,\r\nagainst illiteracy. I have made dozens of speeches for it, written\r\na lot, lobbied much, until Congress passed a law stopping my\r\nworking up sentiment for it, by a joint resolution. How much\r\nsentiment has the press created? You had one or two editorials.\r\nThe Times one. No one else in New York gave a damn. The\r\nCongressmen were not made to feel that those ignorant foreigners\r\nwho were fifty-five per cent of the steel workers, must learn to\r\nread papers that were written in American, not in Russian or\r\nYiddish or Polish or Italian.\r\n\r\nI tell you seriously we are not a serious people except when we\r\nare scared. \"Rights of free speech, O yes! they must be preserved.\r\nDemocracy has its balancing of forces.\" All this is forgotten when\r\nthe government is at stake--our institutions. These mottoes and\r\nlegends and traditions presuppose someone who will enlighten the\r\npeople and a people that can be enlightened. Otherwise you will\r\nget the strong arm at work. It is inevitable. Has there been any\r\nmeeting of editors to map a course that will truthfully reveal\r\nwhat Bolshevism is? or how absurd the talk of wage-slavery is? or\r\nwhy the miners strike? or why this is the best of all lands?\r\n\r\nTell me why workmen don't believe what you print, unless it is\r\nsome slander on a rich man, or some story that falls in with\r\nprejudices and hatreds?\r\n\r\nAnswer me that and you will know why the people sit indifferent\r\nwhile papers are suppressed, speakers harried, and espionage is\r\nking.\r\n\r\nMind you, I am not saying that you are alone to blame. Congress\r\nis. The States are. The cities are. The people are. They have let\r\neverything drift. What is our passion? What do we love? Do we\r\nthink, or do we go to the movies? The socialist takes his\r\nphilosophy seriously. The rest of us have no philosophy that is a\r\npassion with us.\r\n\r\nBut there, I have scolded enough. You are right, but you are not\r\nfundamental or basic or something or other, which means that you\r\ncan't put out a fire unless you have a fire department that is on\r\nthe job. Tenderly yours,\r\n\r\nF. K L.\r\n\r\nLane never outgrew his passionate belief in the moral\r\nresponsibility of the press. To Fremont Older, when he took charge\r\nof the SAN FRANCISCO CALL, Lane telegraphed:--\r\n\r\n\"There is no other agency that can serve our national purpose that\r\nis one-half as powerful as a free press, and no other that has\r\none-half the responsibility. We need a press that will stand for\r\nthe right, no matter whether its circulating or advertising is\r\nincreased or not by such a position, and that means a press that\r\nincludes in its understandings and sympathies the whole of society\r\nand serves no purpose other than the promotion of a happier and\r\nnobler people. Journalism is the greatest of all professions in a\r\nfree country, if it is bent upon being right rather than being\r\nsuccessful. I hope that you may be both.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. LOUISE HERRICK WATT\r\n\r\nWatkins Glen, New York, [December, 1919]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MRS. WALL,--I am reminded by your letter to Anne that I\r\nhave said no word to you since that first word of attempt at\r\nsupport, which I threw out on the first day. I meant it all and\r\nmore. Wall was always in my mind, as at heart, the truest Democrat\r\nI knew. He really lived up to the standard of the New Testament.\r\nHe did love his neighbor as himself. He never did good or kindness\r\nout of policy, but always from principle, from nature--which can\r\nbe said of very few in this world. He was without cowardice of any\r\nkind, and without hypocrisy. I believe he had no vanity. He had\r\nthe pride of a noble man and lived as generously toward the world\r\nas I have ever known man to live. This might be said of one who\r\nwas austere, but the dear, old Commodore was to me, and to us all,\r\nthe very symbol of warmth. The one thing I criticised in him was\r\nhis unwillingness that people should discover him for the\r\nfanciful, humorous, wise, and exquisitely tender man that he was.\r\nHe did not leave an enemy, I know, unless that man was a\r\nscoundrel. And with all his reticence he impressed himself\r\nprofoundly on hundreds. I know if there is another world that Wall\r\nand I will find each other, and he will be with the gladdest,\r\ngayest of the spirits. I hope you can look forward to such a\r\nmeeting with the confidence that Anne has, which always astonishes\r\nme and makes me envious. He has gone to the one place, if any such\r\nplace there is, where the greatest longing of his soul can be\r\ngratified--his love for justice.\r\n\r\nIf you have a picture of him, no matter how poor, won't you let me\r\nhave it, that I may hang it beside my work desk, and looking at it\r\nfind inspiration and be reminded of the sane, loving, lovable,\r\nhigh-hearted chap whom I held as a brother?\r\n\r\nDear lonely woman, I wish I could speak one word that would\r\nlighten your sense of loss, in him and in your mother. I know that\r\nyou are not lacking in courage, but stoutness of heart does not\r\nbring comfort, I know. How exceptional your loss because how\r\nexceptional your fortune--such a man and such a mother. Very\r\nsincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. M. A. ANDERSEN\r\n\r\nSunday, [December, 1919]\r\n\r\n... The whole of mankind is searching for affection, tenderness,--\r\nnot physical love but sweet companionship. We could get along with\r\nfewer pianos and victrolas if we had a more harmonious society. We\r\nreally don't like each other much better than Alaskan dogs. Now\r\nwhat is the reason for that? Are we afraid of them stealing from\r\nus--our houses, sweethearts, or dollars? Or are we so stupid that\r\nwe don't know each other, never get under the skin to find out\r\nwhat kind of a fellow this neighbor is? Certainly we are self-\r\ncentered and we wonder that people don't like us when we don't try\r\nto find what is likable about them--and keep stressing their\r\nunlikable qualities.\r\n\r\nAll of which homily leads up to the Holidays. I hope that you will\r\nenjoy them. Nancy is having no end of a gay time, and knows how\r\nreally good a time she is having, I do believe. She is the rarest\r\ncombination of old woman and baby I have ever known, cynically\r\nwise, almost, and soft innocence. She has a dozen beaux and is\r\nextravagant about, and to, each. ...\r\n\r\nThe President is getting better slowly, but we communicate with\r\nhim almost entirely through his doctor (Grayson). I shall be\r\nmighty sorry to leave here, where we have so many friends, but my\r\nhope is to get enough to buy a place in California, one of these\r\ndays, and settle down to the normal life of digging a bit in the\r\nsoil and then digging a bit in the brain.\r\n\r\nGive my warmest regards to the Captain. You have ripened into a\r\nfine beauty and a great usefulness, and I hope that you will find\r\nserenity of mind and soul, which is all that the great have ever\r\nsearched for. With much love,\r\n\r\nFRANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO GEORGE W. LANE\r\n\r\n[December, 1919]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GEORGE,--Things are going well notwithstanding the\r\nPresident's illness. No one is satisfied that we know the truth,\r\nand every dinner table is filled with speculation. Some say\r\nparalysis, and some say insanity. Grayson tells me it is nervous\r\nbreakdown, whatever that means. He is however getting better, and\r\nmeantime the Cabinet is running things. ...\r\n\r\nNed is here and having a good time with all his old girls, some of\r\nwhom have married and are already divorced, so he feels an old\r\nman. Nancy is lovely and merry and quite a belle. She took with\r\nthe Prince of Belgium, and was quite as happy as you would be with\r\nhaving caught a six-pound trout--just the same feeling, I guess.\r\n\r\nPolitically things do not look interesting. There are no big men\r\nin the line except Hoover. The country wants some manly, two-\r\nfisted administrator and it doesn't care where he comes from.\r\n\r\nI hope your eye is better, dear old man. My love to Frances.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nThe Dan O'Neill to whom the next letter was written, was a friend\r\nof early days. Lane always liked to recall this episode. O'Neill,\r\na big elderly Irishman, was in the City employ, while Lane was\r\nCity and County Attorney, and had formed for his \"Chief\"--as he\r\nlustily called him--a most disinterested affection. After Lane's\r\ndefeat for Mayor of San Francisco, O'Neill came one day and asked\r\nfor an interview. When greetings were over he stood hesitating and\r\ntwirling his hat, until Lane said, \"Well, Dan, what can I do for\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, Chief,\" he answered, \"The wife and I were talking it\r\nover last night. We know how these damned campaigns of yours have\r\nbeen taking the money. You see, we have two lots of land--out\r\nthere,\" with a jerk of the hat toward the great outside, \"and a\r\nlittle house--and we're well and strong, and all the children\r\ndoing fine at school--and we can, easy as not, put a mortgage on\r\nthe house, for two or three thousand. We'd like it fine if you'd\r\ntake it, until you get going again.\"\r\n\r\nLane did not have to mortgage his friend's house, but it was these\r\n\"sweet uses of adversity,\" more than anything else, that tempered,\r\nfor him, the pain of defeat. This friendship lasted to the end of\r\nhis life. In 1915, when going back from California on a hurried\r\ntrip, Lane wrote to O'Neill, \"I did not see much of you and I am\r\nsorry I didn't. It was my fault, I know. Your dear old Irish face\r\nis a joy to me every time I see it, and whenever I go out you must\r\nnot fail to turn up, else I shall be brokenhearted.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Lane was very ill in 1921, O'Neill came to pay his respects\r\nto the wife of his Chief. As she went out into the hallway of her\r\nfriend's house, in San Francisco, the whole place seemed filled by\r\nO'Neills, for he stood there and all his three great sons--one a\r\nfire captain, and stalwart men all. It was a sad meeting and\r\nparting.\r\n\r\n TO DAN J. O'NEILL\r\n\r\nWashington, December 24, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DAN,--I am delighted to get your nice letter. It is as\r\ncharming a letter as I ever received, because you tell me of all\r\nthe family and that they are doing well, and that you are in good\r\nhealth, and that you want me back with you--all of which makes me\r\nlove you more and more. Give to the whole family my good holiday\r\ngreetings. Make them earnest and hearty.\r\n\r\nI haven't got money enough, Dan, to pay my fare back after living\r\nhere so long, and I shall have to make some before coming back\r\nthere, but I hope to do it some one of these days. ...\r\n\r\nDan, I know you have been a bad man, and I know you have been a\r\ngood man; and there will be a place in Heaven for you, old fellow.\r\nYou have been an honest citizen, a credit to your country, and so\r\nhave your children, and you will never know anyone who is fonder\r\nof you than I. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO EAMLIN GARLAND\r\n\r\nDecember 3l, 1919\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GARLAND,--I am going up to New York on the eleventh to\r\ntalk to the moving picture people at the Waldorf-Astoria. I had\r\nthem down here and had a resolution put through the Committees on\r\nEducation of both House and Senate, asking the Moving Picture\r\nIndustry to interest itself in Americanization, and I have been\r\nappointed at the head of a committee to take charge of this work.\r\nI have some schemes myself that I want very much to talk to you\r\nabout regarding Americanization.\r\n\r\nI do not know how much time I will be able to give to this work\r\nbecause I have got to make some money, but I am going to use my\r\nspare time that way. Suppose when I get to New York I telephone\r\nyou and see if we can not get together. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTo one of the Moving Picture Weeklies, Lane contributed this\r\nparagraph on Americanizing the foreign born:--\"The one sure way to\r\nbring the foreign born to love this land of ours is to show our\r\npride in its present, faith in its future, and interpret America\r\nto all in terms of fair play and square dealing. America gives men\r\nnothing--except a chance,\"\r\n\r\nTO HUGO K. ASHER\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, January 3, 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HUGO,--I have not written you because my own plans must be\r\ndetermined by circumstances. I think, however, that I shall leave\r\nvery soon. I hate to go because the work is so satisfactory. ...\r\n\r\nBryan has come back. What strength he will develop, no one can\r\ntell. He evidently has determined that he will not be pushed aside\r\nor disregarded. He has been, and will continue to be as long as he\r\nlives, a great force in our politics. People believe that he is\r\nhonest and know he is sympathetic with the moral aspirations of\r\nthe plain people. They distrust his administrative ability, but on\r\nthe moral question, they recognize no one as having greater\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n... I hear there is talk among the business people of setting up a\r\nthird party and nominating Hoover. Two things the next President\r\nmust know--Europe and America, European conditions and American\r\nconditions. The President of the United States must be his own\r\nSecretary of State. We need administration of our internal affairs\r\nand wise guidance economically. Hoover can give these. He has the\r\nknowledge and he has the faculty. He has the confidence of Europe\r\nand the confidence of America. He is not a Democrat, nor is he a\r\nRepublican. He voted for Wilson, for Roosevelt, and McKinley. But\r\nhe is sane, progressive, competent. The women are strong for him\r\nand there are fifteen million of them who will vote this year. It\r\nwould not surprise me to see him nominated on either ticket, and I\r\nbelieve I will vote for him now as against anybody else.\r\n\r\nBut I must quit talking politics because I am going out of it\r\nentirely, completely, and I really have been out of politics ever\r\nsince I left California. I have tried to take a broad non-partisan\r\nview of things which is one of the reasons I have had hard\r\nsledding. But I am going without a grouch, without a complaint or\r\na criticism--with a great admiration for Wilson and with a\r\nthorough knowledge of his defects; and with a more sympathetic\r\nattitude toward my colleagues than any can have who do not know\r\nthe circumstances as well as I do. ... Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ADMIRAL CARY GRAYSON\r\n\r\nWashington, January 5, 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ADMIRAL,--As you know, I am contemplating resigning. It\r\nhas been my purpose to wait until such time as the President was\r\nwell enough to see me and talk the matter over with him. I\r\nunderstand from Mr. Tumulty that the President is prepared to name\r\nmy successor, and that it would not in any way add to his\r\nembarrassment to fill my place in the immediate future. I would\r\nlike to know if this is the fact, for my course will be shaped\r\naccordingly. Two years ago I had an offer of fifty thousand a year\r\nwhich I put aside because I thought it my duty to stay while the\r\nwar was on. When Mr. McAdoo resigned, this offer was renewed but I\r\nthen thought that I should await the conclusion of formal peace,\r\nwhich all expected would come soon. While the President was West,\r\nI promised that I would take the matter up with him on his return,\r\nand since then I have been waiting for his return to strength. I\r\nneed not tell you that I am delighted to know that he is in such\r\ncondition now as to turn to matters that in the best of health are\r\nvexatious, if this is the fact.\r\n\r\nMy sole reason for resigning is that I feel that I am entitled to\r\nhave assurance as to the future of my family and myself. I have\r\nbeen in public life twenty-one years and have less than nothing in\r\nthe way of private means. ... And having given the better part of\r\nmy life to the public, I feel that I must now regard the interest\r\nof those dependent upon me. I wish you would be perfectly frank\r\nwith me, for I would do nothing that with your knowledge you would\r\nthink would make against the welfare of our Chief. Cordially,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HERBERT C. PELL, JR. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\r\n\r\nWashington, January 31, 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR CONGRESSMAN,-- ... It is our boast and our glory that we\r\nhave a form of government under which men can make their\r\nconception of society into law, if they can persuade their\r\nneighbors that their dream is one that will benefit all. There is\r\nnothing more absurd than to contend that the last word has been\r\nspoken as to any of our institutions, that all experimenting has\r\nended and that we have come to a standstill. ... We are growing.\r\nBut this does not mean that all change must be growth and that we\r\ncan not test by history, especially by our own experiences and\r\nknowledge, the value of whatever is proposed as a substitute for\r\nwhat is. The dog that dropped the meat to get the shadow of a\r\nbigger piece is the classical warning. We are for what is, not\r\nbecause it is the absolute best but because it has worked well. It\r\nis sacred only because it has been useful. Until a system of\r\ngovernment, or of economics, or of home life, can be demonstrated\r\nto be an improvement on what we have, we shall not hysterically\r\nand fancifully forsake those which have served us thus far.\r\n\r\nOur Government is not our master but our tool, adaptable to the\r\nuses for which it was designed; our servant, responsive to our\r\ncall. This makes revolution an absurdity. But it also makes a\r\nsense of responsibility a necessity. And while we may not have\r\nbroken down in this regard we certainly have weakened. We have\r\nproceeded in the belief that automatically all men would come to\r\nsee things as we do, have a sense of the value of our traditions\r\nand a consciousness of the deep meanings of our national\r\nexperiences. The things we believed in we have not taught. Hence\r\nthe need for such institutions as the Constitutional League which,\r\nhowever, can not do for each of us the duty that is ours of living\r\nthe spirit of our Constitution. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO HON. WOODROW WILSON THE WHITE HOUSE\r\n\r\nWashington, February 5, 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. PRESIDENT,--It is with deep regret that I feel\r\ncompelled to resign the commission with which you saw fit to honor\r\nme, by appointing me to a place in your Cabinet, now almost seven\r\nyears ago. If it will meet your convenience I would suggest that I\r\nbe permitted to retire on the first of March.\r\n\r\nWith the conditions which make this step necessary you are\r\nfamiliar. I have served the public for twenty-one years, and that\r\nservice appeals to me as none other can, but I must now think of\r\nother duties.\r\n\r\nThe program of administration and legislation looking to the\r\ndevelopment of our resources, which I have suggested from time to\r\ntime, is now in large part in effect, or soon will come into\r\neffect through the action of Congress.\r\n\r\nI return this Department into your hands with very real gratitude\r\nthat you have given me the opportunity to know well a working\r\nforce holding so many men and women of singular ability and rare\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\nI trust that you may soon be so completely restored to health that\r\nthe country and the world may have the benefit of the full measure\r\nof your strength in the leadership of their affairs. The\r\ndiscouragements of the present are, I believe, only temporary. The\r\ncountry knows that for America to stand outside the League of\r\nNations will bring neither pride to us nor confidence to the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nBelieve me, my dear Mr. President, always, cordially and\r\nfaithfully yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO FRANK W. MONDELL\r\n\r\nWashington, February 13, 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. MONDELL,--I wish to acknowledge, with the warmest\r\nappreciation, your letter of yesterday, and to say that I am\r\nliterally forced out of public life by my lack of resources. The\r\nlittle property that I have been able to save is all gone in an\r\neffort to make both ends meet, and I find myself at fifty-five\r\nwithout a dollar, in debt, and with no assurance as to the future.\r\nI assure you that it is with the deepest regret that I leave\r\npublic life for I like it, and the public have treated me\r\nhandsomely, especially the men in Congress with whom I have had to\r\ndeal, and not the least of these, yourself.\r\n\r\nI should like to stay, especially so, that we could put into\r\neffect some of the legislation for which we have been fighting,\r\nsuch as the oil bill, the power bill, and the farms-for-soldiers\r\nbill. I shall leave a set of regulations as to the oil leases\r\nready for operation. The power bill will come into effect soon, I\r\nhope. I am responsible for the three-headed commission, but it was\r\nthe only chance I saw of getting any unity as between the\r\ndifferent branches of the government.\r\n\r\nLetters are still coming in from the boys who want to go on farms,\r\nand I hope that we will be able to lead Congress to see that this\r\nis a farsighted measure.\r\n\r\nI thank you very much for your many courtesies to me. I trust that\r\nyour career may be one of still greater usefulness and expanding\r\nopportunity. With the warmest regards, cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nLate in the year 1919, Lane wrote to James E. Gregg:--\"... The\r\nsoldier-farms bill has been reported favorably by the Committee on\r\nPublic Lands to the House, but has not yet been taken up for\r\nconsideration on the floor. ... Of course, some of the opposition\r\nhas been by those who say the plan does not do something for all\r\nof the soldiers, but this is hardly a good objection, as no other\r\nconstructive suggestion seems to have been made by any one that\r\nwould do anything for any of the soldiers, except the cash bonus,\r\nwhich I believe is altogether impossible, improvident, and not in\r\nthe interest either of the country or the soldier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT W. DE FOREST\r\n\r\nWashington, February, 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MR. DE FOREST,--I do not know that I have received another\r\nletter which has made me feel as conscious of the gravity of the\r\nstep I have taken as has yours. I have accumulated much in twenty\r\nyears of public life that ought to be forever at the service of\r\nthe public, and if I were alone in the world I would not think of\r\ngoing out. But I must think now for a time in a narrower field.\r\nYour own career shows that without holding office a man may do a\r\ngreat good and give wide public service. Perhaps this opportunity\r\nmay be mine.\r\n\r\nI shall be in New York soon and I hope very much to see you and\r\nsee you often. Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL COUNSEL-LINCOLN'S EYES 1920\r\n\r\nSuggestions to Democratic Nominee for President--On Election of\r\nSenators--Lost Leaders--Lincoln's Eyes--William James's Letters\r\n\r\n\r\nTO WILLIAM PHELPS ENO\r\n\r\nSaugatuck, July 5, [1920]\r\n\r\nHere I am at your desk looking out of your window into your trees,\r\nup the gentle rise of your formal garden into the brilliant crown\r\nof rambler roses above the stone gateway.\r\n\r\nThis is a very delightful picture. The sun is just beginning to\r\npour into the garden. He is looking through the apple trees and\r\nhaving hard work to make even a splash of golden green upon the\r\nlawn, but the silver spruce and the tiara of roses get the full\r\nmeasure of his morning smile and are doing their best to show that\r\nthey understand, appreciate, and are glad. Oh, it is a great\r\nmorning!\r\n\r\nAnd on the water side it has been even more stimulating, I have\r\nwalked along the stone wall, the water is down, very low, the boat\r\nis stranded, like some sleeping animal, with its tether lying\r\nloose along the pebbly strand. The gulls are crying to each other\r\nthat there is promise of a gulletfull. Nearer shore the fish are\r\nleaping--only one or two I think but they make just enough noise\r\nto make one realize that there is life in the smooth water, that\r\nit is more than a splendid silver mirror for the sun which streams\r\nacross it. I disturbed a solitary king-fisher as I went out to the\r\nwharf. He rose from his perch upon the rope, circled about for a\r\nminute and then settled back, on his watch for breakfast.\r\n\r\nIt is altogether lovely, a quiet, gentle, kindly morning, such as\r\nyou have often seen, no doubt, when Judah Rock is making its giant\r\nfight to rise triumphant from the sea.\r\n\r\nBut this is not a bit of geologic prophecy nor a Chapter I. to a\r\nlove story, that I am writing. This is a bread-and-butter letter.\r\nI have been your guest and I am telling you that I have enjoyed\r\nmyself. But you, of course, wish something more than the bald\r\nstatement that I like your place and that your bread was good and\r\nyour butter sweet. Yes, you deserve more, for this place is an\r\nexpression of yourself. No one can be here and not see you at\r\nevery turn, even though you may be right now in Paris \"making the\r\nway straight.\" You have put your love of beauty, your restrained\r\nlove for color, and your exceptional sense of balance into the\r\nwhole establishment. It is a man's house--things are made for\r\nuse; the chairs will stand weight; the couches are not fluff; one\r\ncan lean with safety on the tables. But everywhere the eye is\r\nsatisfied. My bed is beautiful, French I fancy, yet it is comfort\r\nitself. The lamp beside my bed is a dull bit of bronze which does\r\nnot poke itself into your sleepy eye, yet you know that it fits\r\nthe need, not only for light but for satisfaction to the eyes\r\nafter the light comes. And the bath tub--may I speak of a bath tub\r\nin a bread-and-butter letter?--the bath tub is not too long--do\r\nyou ever suffer from the long, long stretch into the cold water at\r\nyour back and the imperfect support to the head which imperils\r\nyour entire submergence?--your bath tub is not too long, and I\r\ngrab it on both sides to get out. And as I dry myself I look down\r\ninto that garden of precise, trimmed and varied green upon which\r\nthe rambler roses smile.\r\n\r\nIt is well to have had money. No Bolshevism comes out of such a\r\nplace as this. It makes no challenge to the envy of the submerged\r\ntenth. It has not ostentation. It gives off no glare, and it is\r\nall used. For men who can put money to such use, who do not over-\r\nindulge their own love for things of beauty, nor build for\r\nluxurious living, but mould a bit of seashore, some trees and a\r\nrambling house into an expression of their own dignified and\r\nbalanced natures, for such men I am quite sure there is or will\r\nbe, no social peril from the Red.\r\n\r\nAnd may I close with a word, an inadequate and most feeble word,\r\nas to the Lady of the House who so perfectly complements the\r\nbeauty and the refinement of her setting. She would make livable\r\nand lovable a shack, and she would draw to it those who think high\r\nthoughts. She has an aura of sympathy and companionability which\r\nmakes her one with the healing earth and the warming, encompassing\r\nsunshine; May you and she give many more sojourners as much of the\r\nright stimulus as you have given yours affectionately,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROLAND COTTON SMITH\r\n\r\nNew York, July 9, [1920]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PADRE,--Oh, that I could reply to you in kind, but alas\r\nand alack! the gift divine has been denied me. My Nancy comes to\r\nme tomorrow--Praise be to Allah! and I shall duly, and in\r\nappropriate and prideful language, I trust, present her with your\r\nmellifluous lines.\r\n\r\nWhen the spirits Good and Bad will permit me to visit Ipswich I\r\ncannot say. Are Doctors of the carnal or the spiritual? They hold\r\nme. So soon as I was given a few ducats these banditti rose to rob\r\nme. Polite, they are, these modern sons of Dick Turpin, and clever\r\nindeed, for they contrive that you shall be helpless, that you may\r\nnot in good form resist their calculated, schemed, coordinated\r\nblood-drawing. And I had as lief have a Sioux Medicine man dance\r\na one-step round my camp fire, and chant his silly incantation for\r\nmy curing, as any of these blood pressure, electro-chemical, pill,\r\npowder specialists. Give me an Ipswich witch instead. Let her lay\r\nhands on me. Soft hands that turn away wrath. Have you such or did\r\nyour ancestors, out of fear of their wives, burn them all?\r\n\r\nWell, this is no way for a sober, sick, sedate citizen to be\r\ntalking to a Man of the Cloth, even tho' he be on vacation. Have\r\nyou read any of Leonard Merrick's novels? CONRAD IN QUEST OF HIS\r\nYOUTH, for instance? If not, do so now. They are what you literati\r\nwould designate as G. S.--great stuff.\r\n\r\nGive me another cheering line, do! For I live in a world that is\r\nnot altogether lovely.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JAMES M. COX DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT\r\n\r\nNew York City, July 25, 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR GOVERNOR,--I shall presume upon your flattering invitation\r\nto speak frankly, not in the hope that I may in any way enlighten\r\na man of such experience and success, but that I may possibly\r\naccentuate some point that you may recognize as important, which\r\nin the rush of things, might be overlooked. If I should appear in\r\nthe least didactic, I beg that you charge it to my desire for\r\ndefiniteness, and my inability to give the atmosphere of a\r\npersonal conversation.\r\n\r\nA WORD AS TO GENEROSITY\r\n\r\nThe unforgivable sin in our politics is a lack of generosity.\r\nSmallness, meanness, extreme partisanship, littleness of any kind\r\n--these are not in accord with the American conception of an\r\nAmerican leader. A clever thing may gratify a man's own immediate\r\npartisan following, but the impression on the country at large is\r\nnot good. We want a FULL, adequate appreciation of the fact that\r\nthere is hardly more than a film that divides Republican from\r\nDemocrat; indeed, in that fact lies our hope of success. We must\r\nwin FIRST VOTERS and Independents.\r\n\r\nLet me be concrete;--The war was won by Republicans as well as\r\nDemocrats. ... Therefore, I would say, give generously of\r\nappreciation to the Republicans, who raised Liberty Loans, who\r\nadministered food affairs, who put their plants at the Nation's\r\nservice, who directed the various activities, such as aeroplane\r\nmaking, and transporting and financing during the war. ...\r\n\r\nA day has come when partisanship with its personalities and\r\nbitterness does not satisfy the public. We have seen things on too\r\nlarge a scale now to believe in the importance of trifles, or in\r\nthe adequacy of trifling men. We must have men who are large\r\nenough to be international and national at the same time, to be\r\npoliticians and yet American statesmen, to subordinate always the\r\nindividual ambition and the party advantage to the national good.\r\n\r\nTHE LEAGUE OF NATIONS\r\n\r\nI feel that we have not tried to interpret the League of Nations\r\nto our people in terms of America's advantage. We Democrats are\r\nlooked upon as International visionaries because we have not been\r\nwilling to deal practically with a practical situation.\r\n\r\nThe League is not anti-national, it is anti-war; its aim is to\r\ndefer war and reduce the chances of war between nations. This is\r\nto be effected, not by creating a super-nation, or by binding us\r\nto abide by the decisions of a super-national tribunal, but by\r\nestablishing the method and machinery by which the opinion of the\r\nworld may become effective as against those inclined toward war.\r\n\r\nBy adopting the League, we do not pledge ourselves to any war\r\nunder any circumstances, without the consent of Congress. And\r\nbecause we have not been willing to say this, we are now in danger\r\nof losing the one chance the world has had to get the nations\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nLoyalty to the President's principles does not mean loyalty to his\r\nmethods. They have been wrong as to the League, in my opinion. You\r\ncould deal with Congress, even a Republican Congress, on this\r\nmatter, I believe, and come out with the essentials. ...\r\n\r\nDon't let Bryan get away from you, if you can help it, because he\r\nreally represents a great body of moral force and opinion. But\r\ndon't pay the price to Bryan or Wilson or Hearst or Murphy or any\r\none else, of being untrue to your own belief as to the wise and\r\npracticable national policy, that you may gain their support.\r\n\r\nThere couldn't be a better year in which to lose, for something\r\nreal. You can not win as a Wilson man, nor as a Murphy man, nor as\r\na Hearst man. The nation is crying out for leadership, not pussy-\r\nfooting nor pandering. Be wrong strongly if you must be wrong,\r\nrather than be right weakly. You can only win as a Cox man, one\r\nwho owns himself, has his own policies, is willing to go along,\r\nnot with a bunch of bosses, but with any reasonable man, asks for\r\ncounsel from all classes of men and women, does not fear defeat,\r\nand expects a victory that will be more a party victory than a\r\npersonal one, and more a people's victory than a partisan one.\r\n\r\nYOUR ENEMIES\r\n\r\nPick a few enemies and pick them with discretion. Chiefly be FOR\r\nthings. But be against things and persons, too, so that the nation\r\ncan visualize you as leading in a contest between the constructive\r\nforces and the destructive critical forces.\r\n\r\nAnd the thing to be against is the man who is looking backward,\r\nwho talks of the \"good old days,\" meaning (a) money in politics,\r\nbuying votes in blocks of five; (b) human beings as commodities,\r\nHomestead strikes, and instructions how to vote in the pay\r\nenvelop; (c) privately controlled national finances as against the\r\nFederal Reserve System; (d) taxation of the poor through indirect\r\ntaxes on pretext of protecting industry; (e) seventy-five cent\r\nwheat; (f) dollar a day labor; (g) the saloon-bossed city; (h) no\r\nAmerican Merchant Marine; all goods carried abroad under foreign\r\nflags--those were the \"good old days,\" for which the Standpat\r\nRepublican is sighing.\r\n\r\nBut the world has moved in the past twenty-five years, and America\r\nnot only has moved it, but has kept in the lead. ...\r\n\r\nWHAT WE WANT\r\n\r\nA greater America--that is our objective.\r\n\r\nWe want our unused lands put to use.\r\n\r\nWe want the farm made more attractive through better rural\r\nschools, better roads everywhere, more frequent connection between\r\ntown and farm, better means of distribution of products.\r\n\r\nWe want more men with garden homes instead of tenement houses.\r\n\r\nWe want our waters, that flow idly to the sea, put to use; more\r\nstored water for irrigation, more hydroelectric plants to supply\r\nindustries, railroads and home and farming activities. There\r\nshould be electric lights upon the farm, and power for the sewing\r\nmachine and the churn. It can be done because it is being done on\r\nthe best farms of the far West.\r\n\r\nWe want our streams controlled so that they do not wash away our\r\ncities, farms, and railroads, and so as to redeem the submerged\r\nbottom lands for the next generation. ...\r\n\r\nWe want fewer boys and girls, men and women, who can not read or\r\nwrite the language of our laws, newspapers, and literature, ...\r\nthat those who live with us may really be of us. ...\r\n\r\nWe should dignify the profession of teaching as the foundation\r\nprofession of modern democratic life. ...\r\n\r\nWe want definite and continuing studies made of our great\r\nindustrial fiscal and social problems. The framing of our policies\r\nshould not be left to emotional caprice, or the opportunism of any\r\ngroup of men, but should be the result of sympathetic and deep\r\nstudy by the wisest men we have, irrespective of their politics.\r\nThere should be industrial conferences, such as those recently\r\ninaugurated, to arrive at the ways by which those who furnish the\r\nfinancial arm of industry and those who furnish the working arm of\r\nindustry may most profitably and productively be brought into\r\ncooperation. ... Through the study of what has been done we can\r\ngive direction to our national thought and work with a will toward\r\na condition in which labor will have recognition and be more\r\ncertainly insured against the perils of non-occupation and old\r\nage, and capital become entitled to a sure return, because more\r\nconstantly and productively USED.\r\n\r\nThen, too, we need a study made of the health conditions of our\r\nchildren,--of the reason for the large percentage of undeveloped\r\nand subnormal children who are brought to our schools, and the\r\nlarger number who do not reach maturity. ... Underfed boys and\r\nignorant boys are the ones who turn to Bolshevism. We can not\r\nstand pat and let things drift without their drifting not to the\r\n\"good old days\" but to bad new days.\r\n\r\nWhy should not our system of taxation be subject for the\r\nprofoundest study? ... We must find ways by which the individual\r\nmay have tools for production which his skill and foresight and\r\nthrift have created and yet take for society in taxes what society\r\nitself gives. ... There must come to society an increasingly large\r\nportion of the wealth created by each generation through\r\ninheritance taxes. Thus all our boys and girls will start the race\r\nof life more nearly at the scratch. This will be for the making of\r\nthe race and for the enriching of the whole of society. Yet there\r\nmust be saved, surely, the call upon the man of talent for every\r\nounce of energy that he has and every spark of imagination.\r\n\r\nWe want our soldiers and sailors to be more certain of our\r\ngratitude and to have an opportunity to realize their own ambition\r\nfor themselves. We must not be driven into any foolish or\r\nimpossible course by the pressure of a desire to win their votes.\r\nOn the contrary, the pressure should come from us who had not the\r\nopportunity to risk our lives, that those who did take such risk\r\nshall be highly honored. For those who will identify themselves\r\nwith the tilling of the soil, there should be farms, small yet\r\ncomplete, for which they can gradually pay on long time. For\r\nothers there should be such education for professional or\r\nindustrial life as they desire. For others, a home, not a\r\nspeculation in real estate, but a piece of that American soil for\r\nwhich they fought. For these things we can pay without extra\r\nfinancial strain, if we dedicate to this purpose merely the\r\ninterest upon the monies which other nations owe us. The extent of\r\nour willingness to help these men is not to be measured by their\r\nrequest but rather by our ability and their lasting welfare. ...\r\n\r\nWe are to extend our activities into all parts of the world. Our\r\ntrade is to grow as never before. Our people are to resume their\r\nold place as traders on the seven seas. We are to know other\r\npeoples better and make them all more and more our friends,\r\nworking with them as mutually dependent factors in the growth of\r\nthe world's life. For this day a definite foreign policy must be\r\nmade, one that is fair; to which none can take exception. Our\r\npeople shall go abroad for their good and the good of other lands,\r\nwith their skilled hands and their resourceful minds, and their\r\nenergetic capital, and they must be assured of support abroad, as\r\nat home, in every honest venture.\r\n\r\nTRUE AMERICANISM\r\n\r\nAMERICA's ambition is to lead the world in showing what Democracy\r\ncan effect. This would be my conception of the large idea of the\r\ncampaign. It involves much more than the League of Nations. This\r\nis our hour of test. We must not be little in our conception of\r\nourselves, nor yet have a conceit that is self-destructive.\r\n\r\nAmerica must prove herself a living thing, with policies that are\r\nadequate to new conditions. ... We wish an international\r\nsettlement that will enable us to be more supremely great as\r\nnationalists. This is the significance of the League of Nations.\r\nIt is a plan of hope. It is the only plan which the mind of man\r\nhas evolved which any number of nations has ever been willing to\r\naccept as a buffer against devil-made war. ... It is a monumental\r\nexperiment which this century and other centuries will talk of and\r\nthink of and write of because it involves the lives of men and\r\nwomen under it, and there is the possibility of giving our full\r\nthought and energy and wealth to making life more enjoyable and\r\nfiner instead of more horrible and cruel. While other nations are\r\nin the mood, we should agree with them, that we may spend our\r\nlives and money in a rivalry of progress rather than in a\r\ncompetition in the art of scientific boy-murder. There are times\r\nwhen war is the ultimate and necessary appeal, but those times\r\nshould be made fewer by American genius and sacrifice.\r\n\r\nAnd our prestige and power should not be wasted at this critical\r\ntime, because out of some fecund mind may come an abstract and\r\nlegalistic plan for some other kind of League. Let us be\r\npractical. Let us go to the fullest limit with other nations who\r\nare now willing to join hands with us, yet never yielding the\r\nConstitutional Congressional control over our war making. ... Let\r\nus take thought to-day of our opportunities else these may not\r\nexist tomorrow. ... Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO TIMOTHY SPELLACY\r\n\r\nAugust 2, 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR TIM,--Here you are, when you are sick yourself, worrying\r\nabout me. Now, don't give any concern to any matter excepting\r\ngetting thoroughly well, just as soon as possible. You are doing\r\ntoo much. You are not resting enough, and you are worrying. You\r\nhave got enough to take care of yourself and your family for the\r\nrest of your lives, you have the respect of every one who knows\r\nyou, and the affection of every one who knows you well; in fact,\r\nyou have nothing to work for, and every reason to be contented. So\r\nI suggest that you learn, in your later years, how to bum. I have\r\nno doubt that Mike will come across something very good in\r\nColombia, if he doesn't get the fever, or break his blooming neck.\r\nI have never seen so aggressive a group of old men as you fellows\r\nare. You will not admit that you are more than twenty-one. ...\r\n\r\nWith my warmest regards, as always cordially yours, FRANKLIN K.\r\nLANK\r\n\r\nWith the presentation of an Irish flag, August 10, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Edward L. Doheny, with the cordial esteem of Franklin K. Lane.\r\n\r\nThis flag is a symbol. It stands for the finest thing in a human\r\nbeing--aspiration--the seed of the Divine. It represents the\r\nnoblest hope of a thwarted and untiring people. It makes a call to\r\nthe heart of every generous-minded man, and gives vivifying\r\nimpulse to the home-loving of all faces. It is a symbol of a\r\npeople to whom most of the arts were known when England and\r\nAmerica were forest wastes, whose women have made the world\r\nbeautiful by their virtue, and whose men have made the world free\r\nby their courage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Franklin D. Roosevelt New York, August, [1920]\r\n\r\nDEAR OLD MAN,--This is hard work--to say that I can't be with you\r\non this great day in your life. [Footnote: Notification ceremonies\r\nfollowing Franklin D. Roosevelt's nomination as Vice-president by\r\nthe Democratic party.] You know that only the mandate of the\r\nmedical autocrats would keep me away, not that I could do you any\r\ngood by being there, but that you might know that many men like\r\nmyself take pride in you, rejoice in your opportunity, and keep\r\nour faith in Democracy because out of it can come men of ideals\r\nlike yourself. I know/that you will not allow yourself to become\r\ncheap, undignified, or demagogical. Remember, that East and West\r\nalike, we want gentlemen to represent us, and we ask no man to be\r\na panderer or a hypocrite to get our votes. Frankness, and\r\nlargeness, and simplicity, and a fine fervor for the right, are\r\nvirtues that some must preserve, and where can we look for them if\r\nnot from the Roosevelts and the Delanos?\r\n\r\nIt is a great day for you and for all of us. Be wise! Don't be\r\nbrilliant. Get plenty of sleep. Do not give yourself to the\r\nhandshakers. For now your word carries far, and it must be a word\r\nworthy of all you stand for. I honestly, earnestly ask God's\r\nblessing on you. As always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nOur love to your dear Mother,--proud happy Mother,--and to\r\nEleanor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. George Ehle\r\n\r\nKatonah, September, 1920\r\n\r\nTO THE EHLE,--Now this is a pleasure to have a minute's talk with\r\nyou in the cool under an apple tree. You are gay, with Grouitches,\r\nand other festive creatures, while I am glum, gloomy and\r\nlugubrious. You know this is a novel experience for me to be in\r\ncare of two nurses and a doctor, not to speak of a wife; but I am\r\nobedient, docile, humble, tractable, and otherwise dehumanized.\r\nThe plan here is to follow my boy's statement of the modern\r\nprescription for women, \"Catch 'em young; treat 'em rough; tell\r\n'em nothing.\" Well, they don't catch me young, but otherwise the\r\nprescription is filled. They reduced me to weakness, dependence,\r\nand a sort of sour-mash, and now they say that on this foundation\r\nthey will build me up. Tho' I am still to lose some weight, being\r\nonly twenty-four pounds under my average for twenty years. I will\r\nemerge from this spot, if I emerge at all, a regular Apollo, and\r\nwill do Russian dances for you on that lovely lawn under the\r\nmulberry tree. And what happy memories of that spot I do have, and\r\nthey cluster about you, with your soft hand and your understanding\r\neye and your sympathetic mouth. You don't mind my making love to\r\nyou in this distant fashion do you? Well, this is a charming jail,\r\nbut jail it is after all, for I can't flee, though all the leisure\r\nin the world were mine--and it irks an American eagle or eaglet.\r\n\r\nDear Anne has been improving here. She now is jolly, tho' it has\r\nbeen hot. Responsibility kills her, and I thrive on it.\r\n\r\nI believe I will take that place we went to see on the Shepaug.\r\nRyan, my friend, is to manage it. Well, we have a place of refuge,\r\neh? where the wicked and the boring and the ununderstanding cannot\r\npursue.\r\n\r\nBut oh! my dreams do not come true these days, the magic touch is\r\nlost, the Fairies have been hurt in their feelings, my Daemon has\r\ndeserted, and instead of beauty and joy and power, sweet content\r\nand warm friendship, I am struggling merely to live--and to what\r\nend?\r\n\r\nPlease go into my room some morning early and look out to the\r\ngate, the cobwebs must be diamond-sprinkled on the circle at the\r\ndoorway, the catalpa trees must stand like stiff, prim, proper,\r\nknickerbockered footmen, on either side of the hedge, the ground\r\nmust rise in a very gradual swell and culminate in the rose-\r\ncovered gate. Throw it a kiss for me--(I wonder if there could be\r\nany roses left?). All of it is a lovely bit of man's handiwork,\r\nand Mr. Eno should have been born poor so that his planning mind,\r\nconceiving things of beauty in regular and balanced form, could\r\nhave been used by many.\r\n\r\nTell him I got his nice letter and will drop him a line one day.\r\nWith much love,\r\n\r\nFRANK LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ISADORE B. DOCKWEILER\r\n\r\nWashington, September 25, 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DOCKWEILER,--It is a great disappointment that I am not\r\nable to speak in California this year, I wished so much to say a\r\nword that might be helpful to Senator Phelan. I helped in his\r\nelection six years ago, and I wanted to be able to say to those\r\nwhom I then addressed, that Phelan had thoroughly made good in\r\nWashington. He has been strong, honest, courageous, loyal to\r\nCalifornia and the country, and at every minute he has been at the\r\nservice of his constituents. That is much to say, isn't it? Well,\r\nevery word is true. ...\r\n\r\nThese things I know, for I have watched him through the past six\r\nyears and for many years before. Indeed, it is more than thirty\r\nyears now since we first joined with boyish enthusiasm in the\r\nactivities of the Young Men's Democratic League, and always I have\r\nwondered at his willingness to make himself the target of so much\r\ncriticism because of his loyalty to convictions that have not\r\npleased those in political or social power. He thinks; he does not\r\ntake orders. And you can rely on his being superior to the\r\npartisan phase of any real issue. This self-respecting, or self-\r\nowned individual is the sort of man we need to promote in our\r\npolitical life, or else we will soon find ourselves back in the\r\npre-Roosevelt days of political invertebrates. I found in\r\nWashington the secret of the exceeding great authority which the\r\nolder states carry in Congress, they return their Senators and\r\nCongressmen, term after term, and give them opportunity to rise to\r\npositions of eminence in the national legislature. The usefulness\r\nof a Senator is not to be measured by the roundness of his\r\nperiods, nor even by the soundness of his ideas. He must pass\r\nthrough a period of impatient waiting before his status is such\r\nthat he can really have the opportunity to have his ideas\r\nconsidered seriously. By returning men who have been faithful, the\r\nState strengthens itself in Washington and eventually gains\r\ngreatly in prestige, as in the case of Julius Kahn. Senator Phelan\r\nhas now passed through this initial period of gaining status, and\r\nhis future will be one of an assured and much strengthened\r\nposition among his colleagues. Not to return Phelan will mean a\r\nloss at Washington that California can ill afford at this critical\r\ntime, for in the national mind he is identified with her prime\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\n... These are to be most momentous times ... Just where we are\r\ngoing no one knows, but clearly the people here, as elsewhere, are\r\nbent upon testing the value of Democracy as a cooperative\r\norganization of men and women, and are determined to make of it a\r\nfuller expression of human capacities and hopes. We must feel our\r\nway carefully at such a time, but we must act constructively, else\r\nthere will surely come a dangerous radical reaction. Sympathy must\r\nbe checked by wisdom, a wise knowledge of man's limitations and\r\ntendencies, that we do not take on burdens we cannot safely carry.\r\nYet we must dare, and dare purposefully. What can this Democracy\r\ndo for men and women--that is the super-question which rises like\r\nShasta and follows one throughout the day, dominating every\r\nprospect. And the answer must be wrought out of the sober thought\r\nand the proved experience of our statesmen. ... Cordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn September, 1920, he wrote,--\"Things look dark to me\r\npolitically. The little Wilson (as distinguished from the Great\r\nWilson) is now having his day. Cox is making a manly fight on\r\nbehalf of the President's League, but the administration is\r\nsullen, is doing nothing. Cox will be defeated not by those who\r\ndislike him but by those who dislike Wilson and his group. This\r\nseems mighty unjust.\"\r\n\r\nTo Hall McAllister\r\n\r\nKatonah, September 25 [?], 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HALL,--This paper is a concession to my love for color, it\r\nis not yellow, but golden, and to make the touch truly Californian\r\nI should write with a blue pencil.\r\n\r\nI cannot write as gaily or as bravely as you did, for I have been\r\npretty well beaten down to my knees. My nights are so unforgivably\r\nbad--wakened up two or three times, always with this Monster\r\nsqueezing my heart in his Mammoth hand--By God, it is something\r\nDante overlooked ...\r\n\r\nTake my advice, dear Hall, and avoid doing any of the things which\r\nthe 3793 Doctors I have paid tell me cause this thing--among them\r\nare;--smoking, eating, drinking, swearing, working.\r\n\r\nYou can recover partially--not wholly under any circumstances--if\r\nyou arrive at a state of Nirvana before death. ... Gay life this,\r\nmy boy! I've been so wicked and fast and devilish and hoggish and\r\ngluttonous and always rotten and riotous that I needs must spend a\r\nfew months in this agony by way of preliminary atonement before I\r\nmay get even a chance at purgatory.\r\n\r\nYou know that sometimes in the most terrific crushing pain, I\r\nlaugh, at the thought that my steady years of drive and struggle\r\nto help a lot of people to get justice, or a chance, should be\r\ngloriously crowned by an ironical God with an end that would make\r\na sainted Christian, in Nero's time, regret his premature taking-\r\noff. ...\r\n\r\nTell that most charming of all women, who is your sister, that her\r\nnoble man was in great good fortune; and I envy him because the\r\nGods showed their love for him even up to the last. The wicked,\r\ntorturing devils respected his gay spirit as he passed along and\r\nforgot to fill him full of arrows, poisoned arrows, as he ran the\r\ngauntlet down to the River. Her letters are beauteous reflections\r\nof her thoroughbred soul, and they give delight to Anne and\r\nmyself. ... Yours as always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO MRS. GEORGE EHLE\r\n\r\nBethel, October [3], 1920\r\n\r\nThat is so charming and gracious a letter that it must be answered\r\nwithin the day, not that any word in kind can be returned, but the\r\nspirit may be echoed. We may be short in words but not in feeling.\r\nLet me tell you, Lady Ehle, about this place. It is Nirvana-in-\r\nthe-Wilderness, the Sacred, Serene Spot. Beautiful, for it is a\r\nridge surrounded by mountains--or \"mountings\"--of gold and green,\r\nrusset and silver. Noiseless, no dogs bark or cats mew or autos\r\nhonk. Peaceful--no business. Nothing offends. Isn't that Nirvana?\r\nNo poverty. People independent but polite. Children smile back\r\nwhen you talk to them, and you do. And the sky has clouds that\r\ncolor and that cast shadows on purpling mountains and stretches of\r\nmeadow. Yes, this is one lovely spot over which a man named\r\nGehring presides, unofficially, modestly, gently; he has given it\r\npurpose for being, for here he does good by healing, and some of\r\nhis wealthy patients have put up a handsome inn in his honor--and\r\nthey have said so in a bronze tablet over the mantel.\r\n\r\nHow much good he can do me I cannot say, but he is trying, Oh,\r\never so hard to touch my trouble-centre, and I shall give him a\r\nfull chance yet awhile.\r\n\r\nWouldn't it be splendid if Shepaug were assured, or any other\r\nplace of simple beauty to which we could retire to commune with\r\nthe things that, alas, one only discovers to be the really great\r\nthings, the worth while things, late in life. Daily would we\r\nforegather beside that stream to build some kind of altar to the\r\nGod of Things as we Hope they may sometime Be. ...\r\n\r\nGive my regards to the Duke of Saugatuck and tell him that his\r\npicture on horseback is good enough to enlarge--and then I want\r\none.\r\n\r\nAnd to you, The Ehle, may the peace that gay souls need and seldom\r\nget, and the joy that good souls long for, be with you always. And\r\ndo write some more!\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO BENJAMIN IDE WHEELER\r\n\r\nBethel, [October 28, 1920]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR B. I.,--It has been along time since your letter came, but\r\nuntil now I have not felt that I could write. Most of the time I\r\nhave been in pain and I have also been much discouraged over the\r\ncondition of my health. No one wants to hear a man talk of his\r\naches and I haven't much else on my mind. I am beginning to crawl\r\na bit health-wards, I think; at any rate I am moving on that\r\nassumption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: FRANKLIN K. LANE IN 1917. TAKEN IN\r\nLAFAYETTE NATIONAL PARK]\r\n\r\nWhat a hell of a condition the land is in politically. Cowardice\r\nand hypocrisy are slated to win, and makeshift and the cheapest\r\npolitics are to take possession of national affairs. Better even\r\nobstinacy and ego-mania! Cox, I think, has made a gallant fight.\r\nHe is to be beaten because Wilson is as unpopular as he once was\r\npopular. Oh! if he had been frank as to his illness, the people\r\nwould have forgotten everything, his going to Paris, his refusal\r\nto deal with the mild Reservationists--everything would have been\r\nswept away in a great wave of sympathy. But he could not be frank,\r\nhe who talked so high of faith in the people distrusted them; and\r\nthey will not be mastered by mystery. So he is so much less than a\r\nhero that he bears down his party to defeat.\r\n\r\nAnd after election will come revolt in the Republican party, for\r\nit is too many-sided for a long popularity.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to be out of it all, but the Gods so willed. I did want\r\nto help Phelan. The country will think that what he has stood for,\r\nas to California matters, especially oil and Japan, has been\r\nrepudiated if he is not returned. He was California incarnate in\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nRemember me to the Lady and the Soldier. Always your friend,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John W. Hallowell\r\n\r\nBethel, November 3, 1920\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JACK,--You have so much idle time hanging, dragging,\r\nfestooning on round and about your hands that I want to give you a\r\njob, something to do. Eh, what!\r\n\r\nI have taken it into my head, caput, cranium, that I will read\r\nGibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, and as the only\r\ncopy here is too poorly printed to read, and furthermore as I wish\r\nto own said work myself, I would that you make purchase of same\r\nand send it to me. Now, I do not wish an expensive copy, nor a\r\nlarge copy, nor a heavy copy. Therefore I think it would be best\r\nto buy a good second-hand set, say in half-leather--perhaps you\r\ncan get it in six or eight volumes--and it must not be heavy,\r\nbecause I read in bed. About the size of an ordinary novel would\r\nbe very good, and pretty good sized type--leaded not solid. Yes,\r\nthe more I think of a second-hand set, the better I like the idea\r\n--old binding but strong, old paper but light, old type but clear.\r\nTwelve dollars I enclose for a second-hand set. By devoting twenty\r\ndollars worth of time to the search I know you can get a second\r\nhand set for twelve dollars. That is uneconomical, but think of\r\nthe fun you will have. I suggest to you that this was the very\r\nthing you needed to do to bring perfect contentment into your\r\nlife. Search for Gibbon, pretty backs, good type, light in weight\r\nfor twelve dollars. Oh what joy you will have! Really I should be\r\nselfish enough to do it myself but now that I have said so much\r\nabout it I can't withdraw this boon. ...\r\n\r\nWell, get Gibbon and \"with all thy getting get understanding.\"\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO JOHN W. HALLOWETT\r\n\r\nBethel, November 12, [1920]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JACK,--I said nothing of the kind to myself. This is what\r\nI said, \"Now I want a Gibbon. Not a show-off set but a useful\r\none--light and small and well bound. How can I get it? Cotter in\r\nNew York? What does Cotter know of learning and books of learning?\r\nWhat interest does New York take in such things anyway? There are\r\nsecond-hand stores there but they must be filled with novels and\r\nsuch trumpery. No one in New York ever read Gibbon--ninety-nine\r\npercent never heard of him. So why should I send to New York? No,\r\nBoston is the place. There is the city of the Erudite, the Home of\r\nLodge, and incidentally of Parkman, Bancroft, Thayer, Morse,\r\nFiske, and all others who have minds to throw back into the other\r\ndays, and make pictures of what has been. Every house there has\r\nits Gibbon, of course, and some must, in the course of nature,\r\nfall into the hands of the dealers. So to Boston,--and who else\r\nbut Jack Hallowell who knows what a book is, how in respectability\r\nit should be bound, and what size book is a pleasure and what a\r\nburden. A man of learning, identified with scholarship, through\r\nhis athletic course in Harvard, and withal a man of business who\r\nwill not pay more than a thing is worth. Ideal! Hence the letter\r\nand consequent trouble to good Jack Hallowell, who as per usual\r\n\"done his damnedest for a friend,\" as Bret Harte says, in writing\r\na perfect epitaph. ...\r\n\r\nThe reason I sent twelve dollars needs explanation. I put that\r\nlimit because a very handsome edition of eleven volumes sold for\r\nthat price to a friend of mine. It was red morocco, tooled, etc.,\r\nand I thought surely twelve dollars would buy something as good as\r\nI needed.\r\n\r\nNow you have the whole mysterious story. Make the most of it as\r\nPatrick Henry suggested to George III.\r\n\r\nI have your dear Mother's book and will write her when I have read\r\nit. I also have a letter saying that Hoover has named me as\r\ntreasurer of his twenty-three million or billion fund. ...\r\n\r\nThank you for your kindness and write me as often as you can. ...\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO ROBERT LANSING\r\n\r\nBethel, Maine, November 10, [1920]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LANSING,--It is good to see that letter-head, but aren't\r\nyou afraid to enter into competition with Mr. Tumulty, who has\r\nnow, I see, bought the old Shepard mansion and will settle in\r\nWashington. How do they do it with the high cost of living what it\r\nis? ... The transmutation of brass into gold is becoming a\r\ncommonplace.\r\n\r\nTo-night's paper speaks of Knox as probable Secretary of State.\r\n... Tell me where the opposition is to come from--who are to lead\r\nus? ... All possible leaders have been submerged, squelched,\r\ndrowned out, in the past eight years. I wish the whole country had\r\ngone unanimously for Harding. Then we might have started on a\r\nfresh, clean footing to create two parties that represent liberal\r\nand conservative thought. As it is, I think you will see Hearst\r\nand Johnson and La Follette try to capture the radicals of both\r\nparties and make a new party of their own. Then I shall be with\r\nall the rascals I have been fighting since boyhood--the Wall\r\nStreet rascals--as against the other group. But maybe the Lord\r\ncares a bit for us after all.\r\n\r\nI mend very slowly, but I delight in your recovery and wonder at\r\nit. ... I do beg you will give me all the gossip of Washington\r\nthat you can, for I am here in a wilderness, beautiful but not\r\nexciting. As always,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nTo Carl Snyder\r\n\r\nBethel, November 13, [1920]\r\n\r\nDear Carl,--This is extremely disagreeable business, this of\r\nrepairs and restoration. I suppose I am doing fairly well\r\nconsidering that I have been more than half a century getting my\r\ngearings askew and awry. But I am taking orders now and say \"Thank\r\nyou,\" when I get them. Just when I shall be well enough to take\r\nhold again is not yet discoverable.\r\n\r\nStrange how little news there is when you are above the clouds.\r\nOne must be local to be interested in ninety percent of what the\r\npapers print. Make me a hermit for a year and I could see things\r\nin the large I believe, and ignore the trifles which obscure real\r\nvision. But a monk must be checked by a butcher. The ideal must be\r\ntranslated into the possible. \"Man cannot live on bread alone\"--\r\nnor on manna.\r\n\r\nOutside it is snowing beautifully, across an insistent sun, the\r\nfire is crackling and I do not know that I am ill but for the\r\nstaring bottles before me.\r\n\r\nGive me a line when you have a free minute--and take to your\r\nBeautiful Lady my warm regards.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n To William R. Wheeler\r\n\r\nBethel, 17 [November], 1920\r\n\r\nMy dear Bill,--...I am mighty sorry to hear about the Lady Alice\r\nIsabel. Funny that these women are like some damn fools, like\r\nmyself, and do things too strenuously, and then go bang. Damn that\r\nIrish temperament, anyway! O God, that I had been made a stolid,\r\nphlegmatic, non-nervous, self-satisfied Britisher, instead of a\r\nwild cross between a crazy Irishman, with dreams, desires,\r\nfancies, and a dour Scot, with his conscience and his logical\r\nbitterness against himself,--and his eternal drive!\r\n\r\nI can't tell you anything new about myself. I hope it is not a\r\ndelusion that I am growing slowly better. I cultivate that idea\r\nanyway. ...\r\n\r\nIt was a slaughter, the election, and properly did it come to us.\r\nNow be wise and you can have this land for many years. But foolish\r\nconceit will put you out in four. ...I wish you Republicans had\r\ncarried all the South. I am glad for Lenroot--very! ... But\r\nPhelan's defeat has about broken my heart and for Henderson and\r\nChamberlain and Thomas I am especially grieved. Well, it will be a\r\nchanged world in Washington, and I'm sorry I can't be in it and of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAnne has gone to Washington to see Nancy who has not been well, so\r\nI am alone but not for long. I get on all right. God bless you, my\r\ndear old chap, and do rest awhile beneath your own fig tree. My\r\nlove to Alice. Affectionately as always,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n To George Otis Smith\r\n\r\nBethel, [November] 18, [1920]\r\n\r\nDear George Otis,--I love this Maine of yours. It is beautiful,\r\nand its people are good stuff--strong, wholesome, intelligent\r\nyoung men. I like them greatly. I'd be content to sit right down\r\nhere and wait for whatever is to come. It is a place of serenity.\r\nThere is no rush, yet people live and the necessary things get\r\ndone. It doesn't have any Ford factories, but I rather fancy it\r\nmakes the men who go West and make the factories.\r\n\r\nThe autumn has been one long procession of gay banners on the\r\nhillsides, and now that the snow has come the pines are blue and\r\nthe mountains purple; and mountains five thousand feet high are\r\njust as good, more companionable, than mountains fifteen thousand\r\nfeet high. What is more lovely, stately and of finer color than a\r\nline of these receding hills which walk away from you, as if they\r\ncontinued clear across the continent?\r\n\r\nI must get out against my wish, to have a lot more testing done--\r\nfor this doctor differs with the others--and I rather think he is\r\nright. But I hope to get back here and enjoy this air. No wonder\r\nthis stock was for prohibition, the air itself is an intoxicant,\r\nespecially when the snow is on the ground and it comes to you\r\ngently; it is as bracing as a cocktail, not a sensuous wine like\r\nthe Santa Barbara air--tell Vogelsang this--but I presume more\r\nlike the High Sierras, where the fishing is good.\r\n\r\nI shall read your speeches with the deepest interest. Keep up the\r\npublicity. It affects Congress and it justifies the good doctrine\r\nwe have preached. Cordially,\r\n\r\nF. K. Lane\r\n\r\nHave read the speeches and they are everything they should be.\r\nRight theory, clear statement, conclusive facts. A few too many\r\nfigures perhaps, you should keep your prime figures in the air\r\nlonger so they can be visualized. This may be called juggling\r\nfigures in the right sense.\r\n\r\nLane\r\n\r\n To George W. Wickersham\r\n\r\nBethel, Maine, 18 [November, 1920]\r\n\r\nMy dear G. W.,--I have your good letter. By 'good' I mean many\r\nthings--well done as a bit of sketchy composition, a welcome\r\nletter, kindly also in spirit, cheering, timely, telling of things\r\nthat interest the receiver, one, too, having the flavor of the\r\nhousehold whence it comes, altogether a good letter. I had one\r\nalso from Her; which I brutally answered with a preachment--in\r\npencil, too, for I can't write with comfort at a desk and, after\r\nall, what have white paper and ink in common with these woods? I\r\nam for harmony--a reconciler, like Harding. ...\r\n\r\nRoot, as you say, would give a good smack to the meal. The country\r\nwould at once say Harding knows how to set a good table. But tell\r\nme--will he be a Taft? a McKinley? a Hayes? or a Grant? Pshaw! why\r\nshould I ask such a question? Who knows what a man will turn out\r\nto be! Events may make him greater than any, or less. A war, a\r\nbullet, a timely word of warning to a foreign power, a fierce\r\nfight with some unliked home group, the right sort of a deal on\r\npostal rates with newspapers and magazines--any one of these might\r\nlift him into a national hero; while a sneaking act revealed, a\r\nlittle too much caution, a period of business depression, would\r\nsend him tumbling out of the skies.\r\n\r\nThese be indeed no days for prophesying--Wilson gone, Clemenceau\r\ngone, Venizelos gone,--Lloyd George alone left! The wise boy had\r\nhis election at the right moment, didn't he? Surely statesmanship\r\nis four-fifths politics. Harding's danger, as I see it, will lie\r\nin his timidity. He fears; and fear is the poison gas which comes\r\nfrom the Devil's factory. Courage is oxygen, and Fear is carbon\r\nmonoxide. One comes from Heaven--so you find Wells says,--and the\r\nother would turn the universe back into primeval chaos. Wilson, be\r\nit said to his eternal glory, did not fear. They send word to me\r\nfrom the inside that he believed in Cox's election up to the last\r\nminute, although the whole Cabinet told him defeat was sure. He\r\n\"was right, and right would prevail\"--surely such faith, even in\r\noneself, is almost genius!\r\n\r\nI am glad you put Lincoln first in your list of great Americans. I\r\ndecided that question for myself when I came to hang some pictures\r\nin my library. Washington or Lincoln on top? And Lincoln got it. I\r\nhave recently read all his speeches and papers, and the man is\r\ntrue from the first day to the last. The same philosophy and the\r\nsame reasoning were good in 1861 as in 1841. He was large enough\r\nfor a great day--could any more be said of any one?\r\n\r\nLincoln made Seward and Chase and Stanton and Blair his mates. He\r\ndid not fear them. He wished to walk with the greatest, not with\r\ntrucklers and fawners, court satellites and panderers. His great\r\nsoul was not warm enough to fuse them--they were rebellious ore--\r\nbut his simplicities were not to be mastered by their elaborate\r\ncogencies.\r\n\r\nMcKinley was simple in his nature, at bottom a dear boy of kind\r\nheart, who put his hand into the big fist of Mark Hanna and was\r\nled to glory.\r\n\r\nIs Harding great and masterful in his simplicity, or trustful and\r\nyielding? and if the latter where is the Hanna? Well, I don't want\r\nto die in these next few months, anyway, till some questions are\r\nanswered. This would be a part of my Cabinet if I were Harding:--\r\nRoot, State; Hoover, Treasury; Warren of Michigan, Attorney-\r\nGeneral; Wood, War; Willard (of Baltimore)\r\n\r\nYou enviously write of my opportunity to read and contemplate. I\r\nhave done some of both. But that's a monk's life, and even a monk\r\nhas a cell of his own, and a bit of garden to play with; and he\r\ncan think upon a God that is his very own, an Israelitish\r\nProvidence; and, in his egotism, be content. Yes, with a cell and\r\na book and a garden and an intimate God, one should be satisfied\r\nto forego even health. But I hold with old Cicero that the \"whole\r\nglory of virtue is in activity,\" and therefore I call my\r\ndiscontent divine.\r\n\r\nYou speak of great Americans, and have named all four from\r\npolitical life. I concur in your selection. Now what writers would\r\nyou say were most distinctly American in thought and most\r\ninfluential upon our thought, men who a hundred years hence will\r\nbe regarded not great as literary men but as American social,\r\nspiritual, and economic philosophers? It occurs to me that this\r\nsingular trio might be selected--Emerson, Henry George, and\r\nWilliam James. What say you?\r\n\r\nSay \"Hello\" to the young Colonel for me.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nLincoln haunted Lane's imagination, the humor, friendliness,\r\nloneliness, and greatness of the man. This--written for no formal\r\noccasion but to express part of his feeling--has found its way to\r\nothers who, too, reverence the great American.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln's Eyes\r\n\r\nI never pass through Chicago without visiting the statue of\r\nLincoln by St. Gaudens and standing before it for a moment\r\nuncovered. It is to me all that America is, physically and\r\nspiritually. I look at those long arms and long legs, large hands\r\nand feet, and I think that they represent the physical strength of\r\nthis country, its power and its youthful awkwardness. Then I look\r\nup at the head and see qualities which have made the American--the\r\nstrong chin, the noble brow, those sober and steadfast eyes. They\r\nwere the eyes of one who saw with sympathy and interpreted with\r\ncommon sense. They were the eyes of earnest idealism limited and\r\nchecked by the possible and the practicable. They were the eyes of\r\na truly humble spirit, whose ambition was not a love for power but\r\na desire to be supremely useful. They were eyes of compassion and\r\nmercy and a deep understanding. They saw far more than they looked\r\nat. They believed in far more than they saw. They loved men not\r\nfor what they were but for what they might become. They were\r\npatient eyes, eyes that could wait and wait and live on in the\r\nfaith that right would win. They were eyes which challenged the\r\nnobler things in men and brought out the hidden largeness. They\r\nwere humorous eyes that saw things in their true proportions and\r\nin their real relationships. They looked through cant and pretense\r\nand the great and little vanities of great and little men. They\r\nwere the eyes of an unflinching courage and an unfaltering faith\r\nrising out of a sincere dependence upon the Master of the\r\nUniverse. To believe in Lincoln is to learn to look through\r\nLincoln's eyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Benjamin Ide Wheeler\r\n\r\nBethel, 18 [November, 1920]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR B. I.,--From both ends of this continent we talk to each\r\nother. We have both retired from active things and can with some\r\ndegree of removal, and from some altitude, look upon the affairs\r\nof men. Frankly, it challenges all my transcendental philosophy to\r\nconvince me that \"deep love lieth under these pictures of time.\"\r\nAnd yet I must so believe or die. It is a disheartening time--\r\nWilson, a wreck and beaten. Clemenceau, beaten and out. And now\r\nVenizelos gone. Only Lloyd George, the crafty, quick-turning,\r\nsometimes-lying, never-wholly-frank politician left, because he\r\ncalled his election when spirits had not fallen.\r\n\r\nAnd little men take their places, while Bolshevism drives Wrangel\r\ninto the sea, possesses all Russia and Siberia, and is a success\r\npolitically and militarily, tho' a failure economically and\r\nsocially. We have passed the danger of red anarchy in America, I\r\nthink, tho' no one should prophesy as to any event of to-morrow.\r\nCommunism, and socialism with it, have been made to pause. Yet\r\nnothing constructive is opened by the world for men to think upon,\r\nas a means of bettering their lot and answering the questions\r\nflung to them by Russia, Germany, England, and our own home\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nI can see no evidence of constructive statesmanship on this side\r\nthe water, excepting in Hoover. The best man in Congress is\r\nLenroot, and he writes me that unless the Republicans do something\r\nmore than fail to make mistakes that the Democrats will take the\r\npower from them in another four years. But I am nothing for\r\nparties. I cannot wait for an opposition to come in. I would like\r\nto see the Republicans now address themselves to the problems of\r\nthe world at large and of this land. If Knox is to be Secretary of\r\nState, as the rumor is, we will have Steel Trust Diplomacy,--which\r\nwill give us safety abroad, which is more than we have had for\r\nsome years--but it will be without vision, without love for\r\nmankind. Root would give the Republicans great assurance and\r\nconfidence. He would make them smack their lips and feel that\r\nHarding was not afraid of the best near him. Hoover may or may not\r\nhave a Cabinet place, but his brain is the best thing working in\r\nAmerica to-day, on our questions. If Penrose and Co. beat him they\r\nwill regret it,\r\n\r\nIf I were Harding I'd put Root, Lowden, Wood, Hoover, and Johnson\r\nif he wanted it, into my Cabinet and I'd gather all the men of\r\nmind in the country and put them at work on specific questions as\r\nadvisors to me, under Cabinet officers. One group on Taxes and\r\nFinance, one on Labor and Capital, one on Internal Improvements,\r\none on Education and Health. And have a program agreeable to\r\nCongress, which is sterile because it is a messenger-boy force for\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats could do this if they had the men,--but look over\r\nthe nation and see how short we are of talent of any kind. It may\r\nbe an opposition party but it has no force, no will, no self-\r\nconfidence. It hopes for a miracle, vainly hopes. It cannot gather\r\ntwenty first-rate minds in the nation to make a program for the\r\nparty. I tried it the other day--men interested in political\r\naffairs, outside Congress--try it yourself. Get twenty big enough\r\nto draft a national program of legislation for the party. I sent\r\nthe suggestion to George White, chairman of the National\r\nCommittee, and gave him a list, and at the head I put you and\r\nPresident Eliot, classing you both as Democrats, which probably\r\nneither of you call yourselves now, tho' both voted for Cox. ...\r\n\r\nIf I get to California I must see you. But I shall play my string\r\nout here before trying the Western land. My best regards to the\r\nLady. Yours always, LANE\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt\r\n\r\nBethel, Maine, [November, 1920]\r\n\r\nTo THE DEAR ROOSEVELTS,--... You realized what was coming, but I\r\nfear Cox did not; could not believe that his star would not pull\r\nthrough. I wish Georgia and Alabama had gone, too. The American\r\nborn did not like Wilson because he was not frank, was too selfish\r\nand opinionated. The foreign born did not like his foreign\r\nsettlements. So they voted \"no confidence\" in his party. What we\r\nwill do in this land of mixed peoples is a problem. Our policies\r\nnow are to be determined by Fiume and Ireland--not by real home\r\nconcerns. This is dangerous in the extreme. Demagogues can win to\r\npower by playing to the prejudices of those not yet fully\r\nAmerican. ... As always,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Lathrop Brown\r\n\r\nBethel, [November] 20, [1920]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LATHROP,--You are wrong, dead wrong, viciously, wilfully\r\nwrong. I do like this exact science business. I worked at it and\r\nin it on the railroad problems for seven years. There is only one\r\nthing that beats it, puts it on the blink, and that is inexact\r\nhuman nature which does wicked things to figures and facts and\r\ntheories and plans and hopes. Prove, if you will, that there is no\r\nmargin at all over wages, and a nominal return on capital, and you\r\ndo not kill the desire of someone to run the shop. ... Talking of\r\nbusiness men, what about the Shipping Board? O, my boy, they have\r\nsomething to explain--these Hurleys and Schwabs! ... How does this\r\nsound to you? They let their own tanks lie idle, commandeered\r\nthose of Doheny and rented them to the Standard Oil--so that they\r\ncould bid when Doheny couldn't--eh, what? ...\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nTo Timothy Spellacy\r\n\r\nBethel, [November] 22, [1920]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR TIM,--I hear from Mike that you are not in New York, and\r\nso I am writing you out of \"love and affection,\" as I hope to see\r\nMike but won't see you when I go to New York for Thanksgiving. It\r\nwas my hope that we three could have a good talk over Mike's\r\nColombia plans, but do not trouble yourself with these business\r\nconcerns. Get well--that's the job for both you and me. We have\r\nbeen too extravagant of ourselves, and especially you, you big-\r\nhearted, energetic, unselfish son of Erin! Eighteen years I have\r\nknown you and never a word or an act have I heard of or seen that\r\ndid not make me feel that the campaign for Governor was worth\r\nwhile, because it gave me your acquaintance, friendship,\r\naffection. And Ned and George love you as I do. When I get mad, as\r\nI do sometimes, over something that the Irish do, I always am\r\ntempted to a hard generalization that I am compelled to modify,\r\nbecause of you and Mike and Dan O'Neill, in San Francisco--and a\r\nfew more of the Great Irish--. ...\r\n\r\nWell, my dear fellow, drop me a line when you feel like it and be\r\nsustained in your weakness by the unfaltering affection of\r\nthousands who know you, among them--\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Frank I, Cobb New York World\r\n\r\nNew York, December 6, [1920]\r\n\r\nDEAR FRANK,--You are right, but too far ahead. We must come to\r\nCabinet responsibility, and I am with you as an agitator. Twenty\r\nyears may see it.\r\n\r\nThis morning you chide the Republicans for not having a program.\r\nGood God, man, why so partisan? What program have we? Will we just\r\noppose; vote \"Nay,\" to all they propose? That way insures twenty\r\nyears as \"outs\"--and we won't deserve to be in. What we lack is\r\njust plain brains. We have a slushy, sentimental Democracy, but\r\ndon't have men who can concrete-ize feeling into policy, if you\r\nknow what that means. A program--a practicable, constructive\r\nprogram--quietly drawn, agreeable to the leaders in both Houses,\r\npushed for, advocated loudly! That's our one hope--Agree? Yours\r\ncordially,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John G. Gehring\r\n\r\nNew York, December 9, [1920]\r\n\r\nWell, my dear Doctor, here I am at another cross-roads. ... I\r\nleave ... in a day or two with a new dietary and some good advice.\r\nThe latter in tabloid form being:--\"Drop business for a time, go\r\ninto it again slowly, and gradually creep into your job.\" All of\r\nwhich is wise, and commends itself greatly to my erstwhile mind,\r\nbut is much like saying, \"Jump off the Brooklyn bridge, \"slowly.\"\r\n... I am not resigned, of course. Because I cannot see the end.\r\nDefiniteness is so imperative to some natures. However, I think\r\nthat I have done all that an exacting Deity would demand, and\r\ncannot be accused of suicide, if things go badly.\r\n\r\nOur plan is to go to Washington to see some old friends thence\r\nsouth and so to California, for a couple of months. Delightful\r\nprogram if one had health, but in exchange I would gladly take a\r\nsentence to three months in a chain-gang on the roads.\r\n\r\nOne of my friends has suggestively sent me Burton's Anatomy of\r\nMelancholy. To offset it I went out at once and bought a new suit\r\nof bright homespun clothes and a red overcoat--pretty red. In\r\naddition I have a New Thought doctor giving me absent treatment. I\r\nam experimenting with Hindu deep breathing, rhythmical breathing,\r\nin which the lady who runs this hospital is an adept. And what\r\nwith an osteopath and a regular and a nurse and predigested food,\r\nI am not shirking. If melancholy gets the better of me now--\r\nKismet!\r\n\r\nTell your dear Lady that it was infinitely good of her to write,\r\n(and she has, I may say, quite as brilliant a pen-style as\r\nspeech.) And one day I shall write her when the world looks\r\nbetter. My best reading has been William James' Letters; and that\r\nwhich amused me most a new novel, entitled Potterism, by Rose\r\nMacauley, which cuts into the cant and humbug of the world right\r\ncruelly. I see your beautiful serene landscape and envy you. And I\r\nenvy those who hear your hearty chuckle each morning in the Inn.\r\nAs always,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John W. Hallowell\r\n\r\nNew York, December 9, [1920]\r\n\r\nDEAR JACK,--I have tried out New York again and find it lacking as\r\nbefore. No help! They do not know. ... So I am going to\r\nCaliforni...A. I wish I were to be near you--you really have a\r\nspecial old corner in all that is left of my heart. And one of\r\nthese days well indulge ourselves in a good time--a long pull\r\ntogether again.\r\n\r\nI have been reading William James' Letters--and real literature\r\nthey are--far better than all your novels. What a great Man--a\r\nmind, plus a man. Not to have known James in the last generation\r\nis to have missed its greatest intellect; Roosevelt and James and\r\nHenry George were the three greatest forces of the last thirty\r\nyears. Sometime when you come across a good photo or engraving or\r\nwood-cut, or something, of James, will you buy it and send it to\r\nme? I want a human one--not a professional one. I guess he\r\ncouldn't be the pedantic kind anyway.\r\n\r\nBilly Phillips has a new baby-boy born Monday.\r\n\r\nMy plan is to leave here in a week, go to Washington and see\r\nNancy, and get a glimpse of some of my old people in the\r\nDepartment, thence to South Carolina and then probably California\r\nfor two or three months. Ah me--most people would think this\r\nluxury--I think it hell! But it may be for my great spiritual\r\ngood. Certainly if I could have you to walk with for these months,\r\nand more of William James to read, I could take a step or two\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nHave also been reading a bit of Buddhism lately. It is too\r\nnegative--that is almost its chief if not its only defect, as an\r\nattitude toward life. It won't make things move but it will make\r\nsouls content. And I can't get away from the thought that we are\r\nhere as conquerors, not as pacifists. I can't be the latter, save\r\nin the desire.\r\n\r\nPeabody dropped in yesterday from Chicago. (I have forgotten\r\nwhether you knew him well or not.) Able chap, fond of me, as I of\r\nhim. My boy works for him. He sent me a gorgeous edition of\r\nBurton's Anatomy of Melancholy which I have always wanted, largely\r\nbecause it is one of the curiosities of the world. ...\r\n\r\nWrite me as often as your Quaker spirit moves you to utterance.\r\nYour dinner got quite a send-off in these papers, which is\r\nsomething, for New York to recognize Boston! Terribly tough job\r\nthough. Poor babies! Hard to believe in a good God and a kind God,\r\nisn't it?\r\n\r\nI hear talk of shoving Hoover outside the breastworks. Fools!\r\nFools! Best for him but worse for the country. Whole question of\r\nRepublican success turns on the largeness of Harding. I don't ask\r\na Lincoln--much less will do. If he is only a smooth-footed\r\npolitician he will fail. So far he has been the gentleman. ...\r\n\r\nMy love to your whole circle, from Grandmother down.\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John G. Gehring\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, December 31, [1920]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PADRE,--It is the last night of an unhappy year. Never do\r\nI wish for such another. No joy--defeat, dreary waiting. These\r\nwords describe not merely my personal history and attitude but\r\nfairly picture those of the world. It took guts to live through\r\nsuch an unillumined, non-productive, soul-depressing year. Did\r\nany good come out of it? Yes, to me just one thing good--I came to\r\nknow you, your Lady and the beauteousness of Bethel. And after all\r\na man does not do any better in any year than make a friend. No\r\nman makes seventy friends in a life-time, does he? So I must not\r\nrepine nor let the year go out in bitterness. On the credit side\r\nof my account book I have something that can be carried over into\r\n1921, whereas most people can only carry over Hope.\r\n\r\nI hope there is something significant and more than suggestive in\r\nmy turning up here on the last day of the year for examination--\r\n\"Getting a ready on\" for a New Year--that's what you would\r\noptimistically shout if you were here, I know. And that is my\r\nGoodbye word to 1920--\"You haven't beaten me, and I have lived to\r\ntake your brush.\"\r\n\r\nI am being ground and wound and twisted and fed into and out of\r\nthe Mayo mill, and a great mill it is. Of course they are giving\r\nme a private view, so to speak. Distinguished consideration is a\r\nmodest word for the way in which I am treated--not because of my\r\nworth but because of my friends--. Those men are greater as\r\norganizers, I believe, than as workmen, which is saying much\r\nindeed, for they are the surgeons supreme. ... Two to three\r\nhundred people, new people, a day pass through [their shop]. Sixty\r\nto seventy thousand a year received, examined, diagnosed, treated\r\nperhaps, operated on (fifty per cent), and cared for. The\r\nmachinery for this is colossal and superbly arranged.\r\n\r\nDr. Mayo told me to come over at two o'clock and register. ... I\r\nstood in line and was duly registered, telling name, and other\r\nsuch facts, non-medical. Then a special guide took me to Dr. Mayo,\r\nwho had already heard my story at the hotel but who, wished it in\r\nwriting. Accordingly, I was presented to a group of the staff and\r\none man assigned as my escort. I answered him a thousand\r\nquestions, touching my physical life for fifty-six years. Then to\r\nthe tonsil man, who saw a distinct \"focus,\" now there, a focus in\r\nthe tonsils! Nose and ears without focus or focii or focuses. Down\r\nan elevator, through a labyrinth of halls, down an inclined plane,\r\nup a flight of steps, two turns to the left and then a group of\r\nthe grumpiest girls I ever saw or heard or felt. They were good\r\nlooking, too, but they didn't care to win favor with mere males.\r\nThey had a higher purpose, no doubt. They openly sneered at my\r\ndoctor escort. They lifted their eyebrows at my good-looking young\r\nson, and they told me precisely where to sit down. I was not\r\nspoken to further. My ear was punched and blood was taken in tubes\r\nand on slides by young ladies who did not care how much of my\r\nblood they spilled or extracted. They were so business-like, so\r\nmechanical, so dehumanized, these young ladies with microscopes!\r\nOne said cryptically \"57,\" another said \"53.\" I was full of\r\ncuriosity but I did not ask a question. They tapped me as if I\r\nwere a spring--a fountain filled with blood--and gave me neither\r\ninformation, gaiety or entertainment in exchange. Each one I am\r\nconvinced has by this life of near-crime, which she pursues for a\r\nliving, become capable of actual murder.\r\n\r\nThus has my first day gone. It is cold here--slushy underfoot,\r\nsnow dirty, sky dark. How different from a place we know!\r\n\r\nThere are one hundred and fifty physicians and surgeons in the\r\nclinic, and Heaven knows how many hundred employees. No hospitals\r\nare owned and run by the Mayos; all these are private, outside\r\naffairs. The side tracks are filled with private cars of the\r\nwealthy. Scores of residences, large, small, fine, and shabby are\r\nlittle hospitals. The town has grown 5,000 in five years, all on\r\naccount of the Mayos, these two sons of a great country doctor who\r\nwithout a college education have gathered the world's talent to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nI am tomorrow to be medically examined further, to the revealing\r\nof my terrible past, my perturbed present, and pacific future. The\r\nresult of which necromancy I shall duly report. I am afraid that\r\nthey will not find that an operation will do good, if so I shall\r\ntruly despair. And if they decide for the knife, I shall go to the\r\nguillotine like the gayest Marquis of the ancient regime. Yes, I\r\nshould do better for I have my chance, and he, poor chap, had\r\nnone.\r\n\r\nI received your Christmas present in the spirit that sent it. I\r\ncan't say \"No! No!\"--for I preach mixing pleasure with business.\r\nThings are all wrong when we don't. I will never repay you. If I\r\ncould, or did, you would receive none of the blessings that come\r\nfrom giving gifts. The truth is, we knew each other years ago,\r\nperhaps centuries ago, and you have done a good turn to an old\r\nfriend for which the old friend is glad, because it makes the tie\r\nmore binding.\r\n\r\nI told you I would send Wells' history to you, and to it I have\r\nadded one of the greatest of human documents, William James'\r\nLetters. I hope you love the largeness of the man, to be large and\r\nplayful and useful, I say, man, can you beat that combination? I\r\nbelieve I know another beside James who meets the specifications.\r\nAnd strangely enough he, too, evolved from physician to\r\npsychologist, to philosopher.\r\n\r\nWell, here's hoping that he and his High-Souled Partner meet with\r\nmany joys and few sorrows in 1921.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nLETTERS TO ELIZABETH 1919-1920\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Ralph Ellis\r\n\r\n[Camden, North Carolina, March, 1919]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ELIZABETH,--And so they call you a Bolshevik! a parlor\r\nBolshevik! Well, I am not surprised for your talk gives\r\njustification for calling you almost anything, except a dull\r\nperson. When one is adventurous in mind and in speech--perfectly\r\nwilling to pioneer into all sorts of mountains and morasses--the\r\nstay-at-homes always furnish them with purposes that they never\r\nhad and throw them into all kinds of loose company. I have\r\nforgotten whether or no there was a Mrs. Columbus, but if the Old\r\nMan on his return spoke an admiring word of the Indian girls he\r\nsaw on Santo Domingo you may be sure that he was at once regarded\r\nas having outdone that Biblical hero who exclaimed, \"Vanity of\r\nVanities, all is Vanity!,\" after having run his personal attachees\r\nup into the thousand.\r\n\r\nYes, the very solemn truth is that adventuring is dangerous\r\nbusiness, and mental adventuring most dangerous of all. We forgive\r\nthose who do things that are strange, really more readily than\r\nthose who talk of doing them. People are really afraid of talk,\r\nand rightly so, I believe. The mind that goes reaching out and up\r\nand around and through is a disturber, it bumps into every kind of\r\nfixed notion and takes off a chip here and there, it probes into\r\nall sorts of mysteries and opens them to find that they are hollow\r\nwind-bag affairs, tho' always held as holy of holies heretofore.\r\nTo think, to speculate, to wonder, to query--these imply\r\nimagination, and the Devil has just one function in this Universe\r\n--to destroy, to kill, or suppress or to divert or prevent the\r\nimagination. Imagination is the Divine Spark, and old Beelzebub\r\nhas had his hands full ever since that spark was born. \"As you\r\nwere,\" is his one military command. His diabolical energy is\r\nchallenged to its utmost when he hears the words \"Forward March!\"\r\nThere is not much--ANYTHING--of beauty or nobility or achievement\r\nin the world that he has not fought, and all of it has been the\r\nfruit of imagination, the working of the creative mind. You see I\r\ncome very near to believing in that old personal Devil which my\r\nPresbyterian father saw so vividly, and which our friend Wells has\r\nrecently discovered, Satan is smart, and that is a very dreadful\r\nthing to be, I never like to hear the Yankee called smart, it is a\r\nterm of reproach. I don't like to think of a Smart Set. And my\r\nrefuge is in the knowledge that there is just one thing that\r\ndestroys smartness and that is, to put it in a very high-sounding\r\nword, Nobility. There is the test we can all put to ourselves--and\r\nit really is conscience and ethics and religion all in one--is the\r\nidea smart or is it noble? I'd take my chances of going to Heaven\r\non the conformity of conduct to that criterion.\r\n\r\nBut all this seems a far way from Parlor Bolshevism--yet it is\r\nnot so far. For it all comes down to this. The Lord he prompts us\r\nto think and to advance, and the Devil he urges us to be smart, to\r\nswitch our thinkings, our very right thinkings, our progressive\r\nimpulses, to side tracks that will serve his ends.\r\n\r\nAnd that is just what is happening to a lot of the finest minds.\r\nMen and women who see clearly that things are wrong, who have\r\nenough insight and knowledge to get a glimpse into the unnecessary\r\nsuffering of the world and who mentally come down with a slap-bang\r\ndeclaration that this must stop, are allowing themselves to be\r\ncalled by a name that history will execrate, and to smooth over\r\nand palliate and defend things that are bad, out of which good\r\nwill not come.\r\n\r\nYou have no love for Czarism any more than you have for Kaiserism.\r\nYou do not care to make the world righteous by dictatorship,\r\nbecause you know that it is not growth or the basis of growth, but\r\nthe foundation of hate. Now the very cornerstone of Bolshevism is\r\nsmartness--the get-even spirit. Because the Czars and the Dukes\r\nhave oppressed the poor, because when this land was divided among\r\nthe serfs the division was not what it pretended to be, and\r\nbecause the German business managers of Russian industry made\r\nwages and conditions that were brutal and brutalizing, the\r\npeasants and workmen have said, \"Let us have done with the whole\r\ncrew, and take all land and industry into our own hands, killing\r\nthose who were our masters under the old economic system. Let us\r\nturn the whole world topsy-turvy in a night, and bring all down to\r\nwhere we are. In our aspiration for Beauty, let us kill what has\r\nbeen created. In our hunt for Justice, let us disregard fair\r\ndealing. In our purpose to level down, let us do it with the knife\r\nruthlessly and logically,\" Thus disregarding the teachings of\r\ntime, that men are not the creatures of logic, of passionless or\r\npassionate theses, but are the expression of an unfaltering\r\nSpirit. Whenever men have been the victims of logicalness they\r\nhave been wrong. For instance, read the story of the Inquisition.\r\nThey saw what they wanted clearly, those old Fathers of the\r\nChurch. They knew their objective, which was to save men's souls.\r\nAnd they thought they knew the way. Logic told them that those who\r\npreached heresies were bringing men's eternal souls to everlasting\r\nhell fire. And they set about to stop the preaching. Had I\r\nbelieved as they did, I doubtless would have done as they did. But\r\nto be infallibly right is to be hopelessly smart. Thus it is with\r\nall who take a paper system and apply it to that strange thing\r\ncalled Life.\r\n\r\nThis is the defect of the Intellectuals, the \"parlor\" Bolsheviks.\r\n(Better by far be an outdoor Bolshevik, a Red Guard, if you\r\nplease, one who is in and of the fighting, who acts, who lives the\r\ntheory!) They do not think in terms of human nature, of natural\r\nprogress, of real facts. They say, \"all men are born free and\r\nequal,\" and at once conclude that the stable boy can step from the\r\nstable door to the management of a factory or into the\r\nlegislature. Now experience teaches that this is a most dangerous\r\nexperiment, both for stable boy and society. The true philosophy\r\nof Democracy teaches that the stable boy shall have, through\r\nschool and the step-ladder of free institutions, the chance to\r\nrise to the management of industry or the leadership of the\r\nSenate. That is why the foundation of Democracy is political. For\r\nout of political freedom will come social and economic freedom.\r\nThat is why I favor woman suffrage, it gives women a chance to\r\ngrow, to think along new lines and grow into new capacities.\r\n\r\nTo feel acutely that things are badly ordered, and to feel that\r\nyou know what opportunities men and women and boys and girls\r\nshould have, is not a program of salvation, it is only the impulse\r\ntoward finding one. Why then, because we do feel so, should we\r\nharness ourselves to a word that implies methods that we would not\r\ncountenance, and give character to a movement that is at absolute\r\ndefiance with America's spirit and purpose? There is danger, grave\r\ndanger, in doing this. For we can upset our own apple-cart very\r\neasily these days. I have no more of this world's goods than the\r\nhumblest workingman. No man is poorer than I am, measured by bank\r\naccount standards. The education that I have, I fought for.\r\nTherefore I do not speak for a class. To defend the methods by\r\nwhich some men have made their money is not at all to my fancy. I\r\nsee as clearly, I think, as one can, the necessity for the strong\r\narm of society asserting itself, thrusting itself in where it has\r\nnot been supposed to have any business. Yet I know that a\r\nBolshevik movement, a capturing of what others have gained under\r\nthe system which has obtained, and the brutal satisfaction of\r\n\"getting even with the wage-masters\" and making them feel to the\r\ndepths of their souls and in the pain of their flesh every\r\nhumiliation and torture, will permanently set nothing right.\r\nAmerica is fair play. Is it a failure? Have you tried it long\r\nenough to know that it will not serve the world, as you think the\r\nworld should be served? Is there any experiment that we cannot\r\nmake? Are our hands tied? True, our feet may lag, our eyes may not\r\nsee far ahead, but who should say that for this reason man should\r\nthrow aside all the firmness and strength and solidity of order,\r\nforget all that he has passed through, and start afresh from the\r\nbottom rung of the ladder--from the muck of the primitive brute?\r\n\r\nThere are things that we would not hold, that we think unworthy of\r\nour philosophy, that must be changed or else our sympathies and\r\nabiding hopes will be forever offended. And this would be to live\r\nright on under the pointing finger of shame. So we know it cannot\r\nlast, this thing that offends, the badness and brutality of\r\ninjustice, of unfairness to the weak, their inability to get a\r\nsquarer chance.\r\n\r\nYet this does not compel us to forsake the hopeful thing we have,\r\nfor which all men have striven, these centuries through. Must we\r\nconfess that revolution is still necessary? Are we no further\r\nahead for all that Pym and Hampden and Sam Adams and Washington\r\nand all the rest of the glorified ones have done? This land is\r\ntruly a land of promise because it may be a land of fulfilment. It\r\nshows the way by which without murder and robbery and class hatred\r\nand the burning up of what has been, men may go right on making\r\nexperiments, and failing, making others and failing, and learning\r\nsomething all the time.\r\n\r\nSo, I'm for America, because, if nationalization of land and\r\nindustry are wise experiments to make, no one can stop us from\r\nmaking them, if partial nationalization of either, or both,\r\nappeals to us as something that will right manifest wrongs, we can\r\ntry that solution. And to cry quits on the best that civilization\r\nhas done, because all that is wished for may not be realized or\r\nrealizable today, is to lose perspective and balance, and jump out\r\nthe window because the stairs go round and round.\r\n\r\nThere is really no use, and therefore no sanity, in being too gay\r\nor too grave over this old world of ours. That smart Devil, who is\r\nfor the static life, is just now particularly active in his\r\nfavorite old line of propaganda. He knows that the fruit of the\r\ntree will bring the millennium. Eat it and you will be happy. He\r\nknows the short cuts to freedom and justice. He knows that the\r\ncurses that are promised for the breaking of the laws of the hunt\r\nwill be turned into songs. So he is urging and urging, telling\r\nyou, with your imagination and sensitiveness, that all is so bad\r\nthat it is best to take the great risk, telling the poor sightless\r\nones that their very primitive feelings and powers are the only\r\nsafe guides, their last ultimate reliance and hope. And out of\r\ndespair comes the bitter fruit we find in Russia, where they have\r\nwrought what they call an economic revolution, but have in fact\r\nproduced nothing, for chaos is nothing. The wise Tinker who wrote\r\nof the Pilgrim's Progress was too true a Christian Scientist, a\r\nChristian and a Scientist, if you please, to picture his hero\r\nreaching the gate of gold by adopting Despair as his guide.\r\n\r\nProgress means the discovery of the capable. They are our natural\r\nmasters. They lead because they have the right. And everything\r\ndone to keep them from rising is a blow to what we call\r\ncivilization. Bolshevism is the supremacy of the least capable who\r\nhave the most power, most physical power. The thing Democracy will\r\ndo is to breed capacity, give capacity its \"show.\" The premiums,\r\nthe distinctions, must go to capacity to promote it, to bring it\r\nforth, to make it grow, to be its sunshine. A chance at the\r\nsunshine, that's the motto. Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, 20 [March, 1919]\r\n\r\nYou said, you will remember, that you did not mind such\r\nunconventional things as penciled letters--so here goes, Mrs.\r\nRadium.\r\n\r\nThis is to be a conventional letter, too, one of the bread and\r\nbutter variety, the quail and dove, pigeon pie, creamed macaroni\r\nvariety, for all of which much thanks, likewise for much\r\nstimulating talk, your help in planting my garden, many motor\r\nflights through brown woods, and some most charming company,\r\nincluding a man named Ellis and his celebrated son, the pigeon\r\nshooter.\r\n\r\nWe left you in the best possible hands, a lion and lioness\r\n[Footnote: Mr. and Mrs. John Galsworthy.] who through long years\r\nof civilized captivity came tamely to your bars to be tickled and\r\npatted, and, no doubt, when properly fed, purred back. If I were\r\nyou, I would loot their typewriter. Therein are the secrets of the\r\nBritish government, copies of all unknown treaties, plans for the\r\nextermination of Bolsheviki generally and the female kind in\r\nparticular; likewise, therein you will find, narrated with\r\nparticularity, the details of all loose conversations had with\r\nhotel clerks, commercial travelers, teachers, chauffeurs, and\r\nothers of the illuminati, in which \"impressions\" are given to\r\nforeign authors hunting for \"copy.\" Mr. George Creel has these\r\naforesaid gents of the illuminati staked out, so to speak, for\r\nthis very purpose. Your dear friend Vera, the political Vamp, is\r\nno doubt conducting these sweet Innocents abroad, tho' not in\r\nperson of course, being much too crafty and cunning for that. She\r\nhas directed them by the wireless magic of her mind to Horsebranch\r\non the Hill, there to discover a radiating and luminous Lady,\r\nhidden in the pine woods, who will reveal among other things the\r\nfollowing: (1) The nature of Woodrow Wilson's personal character;\r\n(2) The full reasons for his conduct; (3) His occult international\r\ndesigns; (4) How he purposes to free Ireland; (5) The value of\r\nbeing House-broken; (6) The real name of the Man in the Iron Mask.\r\n\r\nAnd much, much more--for she is a well, a fountain, a geyser, a\r\nNiagara, reversed, of information, misinformation, knowledge,\r\nignorance, modesty, audacity, in captivating breeches or in modest\r\ndemure caps or in flowing evening robe. Wise Vera, wise Creel--\r\nthey know their business! The English snooper, with typewriter in\r\nhand, will have a generous swig of the Scotch whiskey of the\r\nvintage of '56, and his tied tongue will loosen, a confiding and\r\ntender and sympathetic hand will softly clasp his, and the Dark\r\nFlower will open to the world--rather mixed that figure! eh, what?\r\n\r\nNow, of course, this is not what I took my pen in hand to write,\r\nnot at all. I had intended after the formalities had been duly\r\nobserved to tell you a few words about my wife. Excellent woman,\r\nthat! But very jealous! very! No sense of her own place! Unwilling\r\nto subordinate herself. Since she \"came into my life\" she has\r\nwalked around in it and otherwise behaved familiarly and at home.\r\nNever, never I beg of you, permit anyone to come into your life.\r\nIt decidedly makes for clutter and disturbance. However, as I was\r\nsaying, she is an excellent woman and has been to the Doctor who\r\nsays that she has suffered much. (Charge for same $10.) As he\r\nwishes to make the same charge for many days the excellent wife\r\nwill not go to Charleston but remain here, that the charge may\r\nlawfully be imposed. (This is where the Christian Scientists are\r\nmore Scientific for they could make the charge in absentia.)\r\n\r\nHowever and notwithstanding, the Peace Conference still lives. By\r\nwireless I have the news that Lloyd George is still doing\r\npolitics, that Orlando is Fiuming (give that one to the\r\nEnglisher), that Colonel House has not told all he knows to\r\nLansing, and that Henry White dined last night with a Duchess who\r\nheld his hand four minutes while telling him terrible things.\r\n\r\nBut this is too frivolous altogether for a statesman to be writing\r\nto one whose mind is interested only in serious things! I can see\r\nher steady, cold, stern eye of reproach. \"And this to me,\" she\r\nsays, \"And 'twere not for thy hoary beard, etc., etc.\"\r\n\r\nI tell you frankly, tho' you may not believe it, that I am not\r\nentirely in a sober mood. Yesterday I planted bulbs with a lady\r\nwho was not bulbous. The day before I shot pigeons for a lark. And\r\nI am boastful! fair boastful, my Lady! My secretary and my\r\nconfidential clerk and my many dark-hued messengers are solemnly\r\nimpressed with my prowess with gun and spade. The truth shall not\r\nbe heard in the land. I am my own talebearer and my own censor. I\r\nknow more about agriculture than the Secretary of Agriculture, and\r\nI know more of Labor than the Secretary of the same. And for this,\r\nthis glorious bursting into fruitfulness at so advanced an age--\r\nyou and your good man are responsible and to be credited in the\r\nGolden Book in which is written, What the Plain People Do for Each\r\nOther.\r\n\r\nThanking you for the Bread and Butter, believe me yours for Life,\r\nLiberty and the Pursuit of Happiness.\r\n\r\nF. K L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, Saturday, [January 19, 1980]\r\n\r\nI am clothed in sackcloth and sitting in ashes. My head is bowed\r\nin humility and I am beating my breast in contrition. There is no\r\njoy in my face and my eyes look downward. Truly I am full of\r\nregret. Did she not write long, joyous, inquiring, curious,\r\ninviting pages to me? and I have not answered! And now will she\r\never make her face to shine upon me and give me peace?\r\n\r\nI would fly to her--yes, fly to her in monoplane, biplane, or\r\ntriplane--but many things deter me. A wife, who is busy with the\r\nGods of the Elder Days; a daughter, who is busy with the God of\r\nthe present day--to wit, a young man named Philip, surnamed\r\nKauffmann, son of \"The Star\" six feet two in stockings or\r\notherwise, late of His Majesty's Navy, Princeton, Football, etc.,\r\netc. The marriage is to be tied in April, God willing, Nancy\r\nordering, Philip consenting, Father paying.\r\n\r\nAs if this were not enough to hinder, the desk must be cleared for\r\nexit--the office desk; for the place that knew me through seven\r\nlong years of trouble, anxiety, insult, joy, humiliation,\r\nsatisfaction, achievement, companionship, hope, shall soon know me\r\nno more, forever.\r\n\r\nVerily, I say unto you, that if ever mortal man or mortal mind\r\nneeded rest, recreation, recuperation, and other alliterative\r\nthings, that same man is now writing to the Lady Elizabeth Ellis,\r\nof Terraced Garden, in Camden, by the Wateree. And he is writing\r\nwithout hope that he will see the Lady and her Lord and the\r\nPrinceling, for moons and moons. This is a sad, sad word for him\r\nto write. But the whole world is skew-jee, awry, distorted and\r\naltogether perverse. The President is broken in body, and\r\nobstinate in spirit. Clemenceau is beaten for an office he did not\r\nwant. Einstein has declared the law of gravitation outgrown and\r\ndecadent. Drink, consoling friend of a Perturbed World, is shut\r\noff; and all goes merry as a dance in hell!\r\n\r\nOh God, I pray, give me peace and a quiet chop. I do not ask for\r\npower, nor for fame, nor yet for wealth. Lift me on the magic\r\ncarpet of the Infinite Wish and lay me down on a grassy slope,\r\nlooking out on a quiet sunny sea, and make me to dream that men\r\nare gentle and women reasonable. And forgive us our trespasses,\r\nAmen!\r\n\r\nAnd again I pray--Give me patience. Let me not ask for today what\r\nmay not come until tomorrow. Let mine eyes not be filled with\r\nvisions of things as they would be in a world wherein men were\r\nGods. Let mine ears be closed to Siren calls which lure to the\r\nrocks. Stiffen my soul to make the climb. Keep from my heart\r\ncynical despair. Make my mouth to speak slow words, and curb my\r\ntongue that it may not outrun the Wisdom taught by the years. Give\r\nsurety to my steps, O Lord, and lead me by the hand for I know not\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nYour telegram lures as your letter did. But such pleasures are not\r\nfor us, because of our sins. \"And those that are GOOD shall be\r\nhappy!\"\r\n\r\nWork. Work. Work. It is the order of the One Supreme. It keeps us\r\nfrom being foolish, and doing as fools do. It is needed for the\r\nmastery of a world that has its Destiny written, as surely as\r\nwe have ours. It is a chain and a pair of wings; it binds and it\r\nreleases. It is the master of the creature and the tool of the\r\nCreator. It is hell, and it lifts us out of hell into heaven. It\r\nwas not known in Paradise, but there could be no Paradise without\r\nit. A curse and a Savior! Our life-term sentence and the one plan\r\nof salvation! Work for the weary, the wasted, and the worn. Work--\r\nfor the joyous, the hopeful, the serene. Work--for the benevolent\r\nand the malevolent, the just and the cruel, the thoughtful and the\r\nunheeding. Work--for things that life needs, for things that are\r\nillusions, for dead-sea fruit, for ashes; and work for a look at\r\nthe stars, for the sense of things made happier for many men, for\r\nthe lifting of loads from tired backs, for the smile of a tender\r\ngirl, for the soft touch of a grateful mother, for the promise it\r\nbrings to the boy of one's hopes.\r\n\r\nWork! Why work? It is the order of the One Supreme.\r\n\r\nSo saying, at one o'clock of Sunday morning, he lifted up his hand\r\nand waved three times to the Southward--once for the Lady of the\r\nTroubled Heart, who flirts with the Angel of Destruction, thinking\r\nhe may turn out to be a God, and once for the Lord of the Lady,\r\nserenely fatalistic, and the third, and this a very big one, for\r\nthe Princeling who is making a manly battle, cheerfully,\r\nconfidently. The Friend of the Three.\r\n\r\nF. K L.\r\n\r\nWashington, [February 5, 1920]\r\n\r\nAnd so, again the Boy has been attacked by a strange enemy, and\r\nyou are fighting. That is what you have been doing for years,\r\nfighting for that bit of life you love more than your own self.\r\nYou did not think you could do it when you were a girl, did you?\r\nYou have wondered at yourself many, many times. And wondered at\r\nthe Fate which brought this long challenge to you. But it has been\r\na splendid fight, hasn't it? A glorious fight against odds. There\r\nhas been no justice in it. No justice, and our souls do so want\r\njustice, an even chance, something in front of us that we can see\r\nand know and fight. God knows why such tortures come to some,\r\nwhile others sail on such smooth seas. Can it be that there is no\r\nsoul excepting the one we make for ourselves by fighting? Are\r\nthose really blest who have such challenges given to their\r\nspirits? Or is this all by way of excusing God, or Nature, for the\r\nunexplainable?\r\n\r\nThere is no way to make the fight excepting to believe that the\r\nfight is the thing--the one, only, greatest thing. (To deny this\r\nis to leave all in a welter, and drift into purposeless cynicism,\r\n--blackness.) To determine that this is the way, the truth, and the\r\nlife, is to get serenity. Then the winds may howl and the seas\r\nroll, but there can be no wreck.\r\n\r\nI know you don't like to be coddled. You are not of the cotton-\r\nbatting school. You can take and give. But \"may I not\" say a word\r\nof appreciation and perhaps of stimulation--give you a good\r\nmasculine thump on the shoulder by way of saying that for one who\r\nlives in a mist you have lots of gimp. To love something better\r\nthan oneself is the first step, I guess, toward making that soul.\r\n\r\nPlease read the note, in special envelop, to Ralphie, when he will\r\nbe interested. By Jove, how fortunate that we could not leave. All\r\nmy force is sick. Three of my assistants are laid up. Six hundred\r\nand eighty people in my Department are in bed. And I am struggling\r\nto get out and leave my job up to date. Good fortune!\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Katonah, August, 1920]\r\n\r\n... You know that I love you--yes, just as much as Ralph Ellis,\r\nwho is a tough sailor man, and Anne Lane, who is a citizen of two\r\nworlds, will let me. But I would love you more, much more, if you\r\ndid not have to be induced by my wife to write to me. Your love\r\nletter was all right, but it was procured. Do you get that word--\r\nprocured--and my wife was the procuress. This may be de rigueur\r\nand comme il faut and umslopogass on Long Island, but it does not\r\ngo in Katonah--peaceful, pure Katonah!\r\n\r\nHere, in this sweet centre, if a lady wishes \"for to make eyes\" at\r\na man, by way of a letter, she does it without being told to do it\r\nby the said man's wife. And then to open, \"Dear Mr. Lane,\"--Gosh\r\nLizzie! isn't that pretty warm!\r\n\r\nMy anger is so great that I am now sitting up in bed at the weary\r\nhour of two to relieve myself--for otherwise I cannot sleep.\r\n\r\nYour remarks upon the distraught condition of the public mind, the\r\nunfortunate fix into which the Polacks have fixed themselves, the\r\nheart-breaking cry that you send out for men to get together and\r\nbe sensible, before they are sadder,--these things have no\r\nlodgement in my soul-center. For I am loved by a lady who speaks\r\nmuch of free speech and courage and candor and other virtues of\r\nprehistoric existence, but who talks of herself all through her\r\nletter and never of me at all. How can the fire be kept burning\r\nwith a cold back-log like that? Talk about me! That's the first\r\nprinciple of all conversation--even not amorous. Well, you are a\r\ngood woman, Mrs. Ellis, and I hope Mr. Ellis is well, and that you\r\nare not having trouble with the help. Goodbye, Mrs. Ellis!\r\n\r\nCome, sweet Elizabeth, let us join hands and go for a gay climb\r\nover the piney hills--you can sing your minor note of sad\r\ndistress--your miserere, if you can, in the face of the puffy\r\nclouds, and I will laugh at you for having too much of world\r\nconcern in your heart. The blessings do not come to those who are\r\n\"troubled about many things.\" The soul is an individual, you know.\r\nWe are saved by units not en masse. Every individual is a species\r\n--isn't that what splendid Bergson says? So come away from\r\nresponsibilities and let your poor heart, which is so unselfish\r\nthat it cannot rest, indulge itself in the luxury of a peaceful\r\nforgetting, for a few days.\r\n\r\nPractically, this seems like a good place--the process is to\r\nreduce you to a pulp and then gradually restore you to form. I am\r\njust emerging from the mash.\r\n\r\nDo give my greetings--graduated calorically as your judgment\r\nsuggests--to the many friends in your neighborhood who have\r\nforgotten me.\r\n\r\nDevotedly, yet very sore,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[September]\r\n\r\nThis is a sentimental letter from a sentimentalist to a sent--,\r\nfor a sent--. It is by way of atonement, chiefly. I want to be\r\nforgiven for all the hard things I have said to you. I feel that I\r\nowe you much, at least a good word, for all the bad ones I have\r\ngiven you.\r\n\r\nYou are a health-giver. That's not such a bad name, is it? In fact\r\nI don't know a better. It doesn't sound sentimental, no husband\r\nwould be alarmed by it, and yet it carries in it implications of\r\ngaiety and tenderness and rompishness with a touch of mysterious\r\nadoration. Altogether it is a very real large word that does not\r\nsignify virtues but rather attractivenesses. Mind, I don't say\r\nthat you have not the virtues--all of them, offensive and\r\ndefensive, but the attractivenesses make life, don't they? And to\r\nbe a health-giver is not merely to have charm. That is the spell-\r\ncasting power, to be filled with witchery, to be a witch. Yes, I\r\nbelieve it is something like that--very much in fact, but the\r\nwitchery must be balsamic, it must be radiant, it must go out in\r\nrays or circles or waves, because it can't help going out, not\r\npurposefully and selfishly, like the casting of a net--it must be\r\nbalsamic and radiant, the outbreathing of pines.\r\n\r\nNow this is a very nice name I have called you--you can put it\r\ninto Latin or Greek or French and make it sound much better to the\r\nunimaginative. But you deserve it, and I hope my little girl will\r\nbecome one.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKatonah, Sunday, [September 25, 1920]\r\n\r\n... We leave here on Wednesday (D. V.) for Bethel because you said\r\nto. Now how soon will you follow--a day--a week? Not more!\r\n\r\nYou made up your mind that you would go there, and there is now to\r\nbe proof given whether your mind is weak or riding strong.\r\n\r\nAnne is to have H. Beale there, and they move in circles barred to\r\nme. So I shall sorely need someone who knows my language. And I am\r\nnot frivolous when I say that you and I need nothing more than a\r\nreligious faith of some kind. Mohammedan, Christian Science, or\r\nwhat you will. We are both religious--deeply. We pray--we do\r\nthings for the good of men and women,--but we do not relate\r\nourselves properly to the Great Enveloping, Permeating Spirit. I\r\nhave sought to, vainly, for many years, and yet I have not been\r\npersistent. \"Seek and ye shall find!\" I want to believe that the\r\nGod of Things as They Are is not wilfully cruel. Is He\r\nindifferent?\r\n\r\nAre we mastering something? Tell me! Do you know? What philosophy\r\nhave you come to?\r\n\r\nWell, all this we can talk over when we reach Bethel. Say, do you\r\never answer letters or is it your Queenly prerogative to drop your\r\nsweethearts down the public oubliette?\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWashington, 27 [December, 1920]\r\n\r\nMy wife won't let me call on you, \"not now, anyhow,\" she says. Oh,\r\nyou have so many enemies! Adolph and Mary, Senator and Mrs.\r\nKellogg, Chief Justice and Mrs. White, Dr. and Mrs. Gehring. All\r\nare against you, and against me--all plotting, planning, and\r\nconspiring with my wife to keep us apart. They know the hold you\r\nhave on me, that I had rather have you as my doctor than any one\r\nelse in the whole vasty Universe--but why sigh? I am to be torn\r\naway on Wednesday and rushed to Rochester, where the Mayos will\r\ntake me in hand, and do their worst. I have great hope that they\r\nmay cut me into happiness, and carve me into health, and slice me\r\ninto strength.\r\n\r\nSo, as Anne wired, we shall not see you in Camden, nor Ralph nor\r\nthe Junior nor anything that is Ellis--not for some moons anyway.\r\n\r\n... The reason for going to Mayos? To see if it is true that my\r\nstomach and my gall bladder have become too intimate. Rochester is\r\nthe Reno where such divorces are granted.\r\n\r\nI'd like to say I love you and the whole kit and caboodle, but my\r\nwife won't let me.\r\n\r\nF. K.

Kaujfmann\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, January 1,1921\r\n\r\nTo that little Fairy with whom a young fellow named Frank Lane\r\nused to wander in the woods, hunting the homes of the Fairies,--\r\nGreetings on her birthday! Has she found where they live? I\r\nbelieve she has. They live where eyes are bright with love, and\r\nhands are gentle and kind, where feelings are not hurt and there\r\nis song hummed, and Play, a very real God, still lives,\r\n\r\n... I think that we have got to see each other some how,\r\nsomewhere, because life is passing awfully fast and there is one\r\nbest thing in it--supremely, overwhelmingly best--and that is\r\naffection. I've chased around after fame and work for others, but\r\nI just wish I had spent pretty much all my time loving you and\r\nMother and Ned, and let everything else come way down on the list.\r\nThe people who really love us are so few, aren't they? Lots of\r\nthem like us, lots of them are glad to be with us, but few can be\r\ncounted on \"world without end, Amen.\"\r\n\r\n... This is surely a very uncertain and unsatisfactory world for\r\nme right now. How much we all do like definiteness and how few are\r\nwilling to trust the future to the Great Spirit. We fuss and fume\r\nas if it would do good rather than ill. Happiness is the thing we\r\nall desire and it is to be had easily through a most simple\r\nphilosophy; do your best and then have faith that things will come\r\nright. Happy people are those who live with happy thoughts; those\r\nwho see good in people and by brave and cheerful thinking are\r\nsuperior to depression and bitterness.\r\n\r\nThe longer I live the more I am convinced that it is our duty to\r\nbe gay; not reckless, never that; not boisterous, but light-\r\nhearted. It saves doctor's bills, brings success, and is the one\r\nmethod, the natural method, by which we become really big, and by\r\nthat I mean superior to the evil forces that try to break us down.\r\n... To be gay one must see how very little some things are, and\r\nhow very big other things are. And the big things are things like\r\nlove and goodness and unselfishness; and the little things are the\r\nselfish mean things, self-indulgent things, things generally that\r\ncome out of one's vanity, one's love of one's self. Get rid of\r\nthat and life becomes a pretty good place. Envy, vanity, self-\r\nindulgence--these are devils.\r\n\r\n... I wish you would really sink yourself into some religion. To\r\nstart right is so important. You will miss much joy in life, I am\r\nconvinced, by not having a faith; something to live by, something\r\nthat explains the questions that rise each hour. Buddhism does not\r\nclaim to be supernatural, is not founded on miracles, and yet\r\nBuddha taught the philosophy of Christ five hundred years before\r\nHe came. The central note is getting above self--real self-\r\nmastery. Possessing, mastering your body and mind so that you do\r\nnot allow envy or hatred to possess you, and do not hanker after\r\n\"things,\" possessions, or fame or popularity, and keep strong hold\r\non wilfulness and anger and your passions. Its fundamental maxim\r\nis that unhappiness and sorrow come from ignorance of Truth--and\r\nTruth is found by submerging self. The body is not bad, the lusts\r\nof the body and the mind are not bad, but the body is no more than\r\nan envelop for the soul, its master.\r\n\r\nGood-night to you both, you are fast asleep by now. ... In my long\r\ndays and nights I think so much about you, wondering what the Gods\r\nhave in store for her who has been so much to me. Much, much love\r\nlittle one.\r\n\r\nDAD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Benjamin Ide Wheeler\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, January I, 19L1\r\n\r\nTo the Wheelers with the warmest greetings of the Lanes! A bonny\r\nyear be this to you--a year of sunny faces--may you live\r\nsurrounded by those whom you love and damned indifferent to all\r\nthe rest!\r\n\r\nI, Franklin K. Lane, am trying to find out if the last doctor in\r\nNew York was right. He said my trouble came from an improper\r\nalliance between my gall-bladder and my pyloric orifice, and that\r\nhere in Rochester they could be summarily divorced. (If you don't\r\nknow where the pylorus is you may locate it as the N. W. 1/4 of\r\nthe N. W. 1/4 of the stomach. Until you reach fame you never have\r\na pylorus--and then it is most costly.) So here I am in a real\r\nReno, hoping that a knife will be able to \"put me to work anew,\"\r\n... and writing this as a proof of \"love and affection,\" whatever\r\nthe legally great may mean by the distinction. ...\r\n\r\nAnd talking of language, have you read what Wells has to say in\r\nhis Outline of History on this subject? I found it very\r\ninteresting; probably all old stuff to you, however. Can there be\r\na science of language, or of anything that a human creates? I am\r\nrather Bergsonian in my idea of the individual man--each is a\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nMiller is very unhappy because [Governor] Harding may leave the\r\nBoard. He [Miller] will go if the new man is not satisfactory. But\r\nI think he will be. For Harding will be conservative and a great\r\nrespecter of wealth. And Miller while a radical in many things is\r\na classicist as to Finance.\r\n\r\nIf Harding leaves out Hoover he will do himself and the country\r\nharm, and Hoover good. At last the sun shines!\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Lathrop Brown\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, January 3, [1921]\r\n\r\nWell, my dear young Spirit of the Renaissance, I am not yet dead,\r\nnot even dying. Slowly I am doing the stations of the Cross in\r\nthis most thorough institution. I am delighted with my experience.\r\nHere is concentrated every form of torture and annoyance to which\r\none can be legally subjected. Cruel and unusual punishments are\r\nforbidden by the Constitution, but I take it that one may yet take\r\ntorture and punishment, if he pays for it. All that I have ever\r\ndone, been or thought has been revealed--probed for, and found\r\nout. ...\r\n\r\nTruly, this is the most scientifically organized organization of\r\nscientists that ever was. Henry Ford could not improve upon it.\r\nCombine him with M. Pasteur, add a touch of one Edison, and a dose\r\nof your friend, Charlie Schwab, and you have the Mayo Clinic, big,\r\nsystematized, modernized, machinized, doctorial plant, run by a\r\ncouple of master workmen. I am seeing it all, and am prepared for\r\nany fate. Thus far I am no more than twenty-one years of age. My\r\norgans seem to be working union hours and to react with proper\r\npromptitude, self-respect and authority. Tomorrow I am to be\r\nphotographed and fluoroscoped--and then will come the verdict. If\r\nit is the guillotine I shall go gaily, like one of your ancestors\r\nin those tumbril days of France. What I fear is an order to\r\n\"rest,\" on a new diet. But I guess whatever is said will be the\r\nlast word--the Supreme Court decision. Fine reputation, that, for\r\ntwo young chaps who never went to Harvard, eh, what?\r\n\r\nWell, tell me the news. You have been silent too long. I long to\r\nknow of your further adventures in politics with one G. White. ...\r\n\r\nAnd now, my dear Lathrop, may I extend to you the greetings of the\r\nNew Year. May you have a continuous and abiding and keen sense\r\nthat you are doing good, likewise doing well.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. George Ehle\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, January, [1921]\r\n\r\nIt is only a little below freezing. The sky is grey. Snow, hard\r\nand frozen over, covers the ground, sleighs go through the\r\nstreets, jingling their merry way. Boys throw each other down upon\r\nthe encrusted snow. Girls in red woolen caps pick their way\r\ncautiously. Farm horses drawing sleds make their heavy way. And in\r\nthese sleds, families sitting on the heaped straw in the bed of\r\nthe wooden box, smiling mothers and happy babies, lined up\r\ntogether, warm, protected from the wind. Trees outlined against\r\nthe sky, looking like dark coral rising out of a sea of snow into\r\nthe dull light. An old man, gaunt, bewhiskered, trudges along\r\nconfidently although he looks over eighty. A younger man,\r\nevidently a stranger, feels his cautious way over the slippery\r\nwalk, covered with furs, hands, head, and body. After him a still\r\nyounger man, without an overcoat--a postman.\r\n\r\nCan you see it all? Do you recognize the picture? Was it once part\r\nof your life? This world is not so very bad when nature challenges\r\nevery one to fight for life. Nothing doing for me now! That's the\r\nword. Too much risk. ...\r\n\r\nBless you, Lady Dear of the Understanding Eye. May we yet meet\r\nupon the gentle banks of the Shepaug and there make medicine for\r\nour poetic souls.\r\n\r\nAnne has been a trump through these ten days of anxiety. Yours\r\naffectionately,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. William Phillips\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, January 11, [1921]\r\n\r\nThe black cat, yellow-eyes, came, dear Lady Caroline--came to me\r\nhere in a hospital and I put him on my table alongside my tiny\r\nbust of Lincoln, which is the sacred place. I wish indeed those\r\neyes could see within this shell of mine and tell what it is that\r\ntwists my heart, physically turns it on its axis, so that its\r\npolarity is changed. From mystery to mystery we have traveled the\r\npast year, Anne, with her unfaltering trust, and I, a doubting\r\nThomas. We came here for an operation, but the doctors somewhat\r\ndoubt its wisdom at all, certainly not now, when pneumonia might\r\nbefall. So after ten hard days of closest examination I go forth\r\nfrom this, the Supreme Court of Surgery in the Land, with no\r\ndecision. \"Wait and see what good it has done to live without\r\ntonsils, and in the California sunshine until spring.\" ... But\r\nthey live in the Land of Guess!\r\n\r\nAnd so another baby has come to bless you and William! Truly you\r\nare a confident couple! Age would hesitate to bring into a world,\r\nso filled with shadow, an increasing number of our species. What a\r\nsupreme act of faith the continuance of the race is. ... Oh, the\r\ncunning of Nature--how empty the heart of man or woman who has\r\nnot felt the clutch of a baby's hand, or drunk deep of the heaven-\r\nmade perfume of a baby's breath. And the impulse that babies give\r\nto life, the challenge that they make to the father is always a\r\nnoble one. It is not so as to women; less, as to ourselves. We are\r\nurged to courses that are petty, unworthy, selfish, debasing,\r\nsupine, and brutal by our own natures or those of our mates. But\r\nfor the child we act nobly, its call to us is always to our finer\r\nside, and so gradually we are lifted higher. Did any man in\r\nhistory ever do a cruel or wicked thing because of the appeal made\r\nto him by the smile of his child? He may have accredited his\r\naction to the prompting of love for his baby, but I believe it\r\nwould be found that there was another motive, generally an\r\noverwhelming personal vanity; so great a lust for power, perhaps,\r\nthat it would carry across the gulf of death.\r\n\r\nI hardly believe that you need fear immediate expulsion from your\r\nnew-found Eden. My expectation is that you will be treated with\r\nkindness by the new Administration, which will act most cautiously\r\non all things. I shall know how to get a word, any word you wish,\r\nto the new President, I think, and my services as you know are at\r\nyour order at any time. But if you are sent into the Limbo of\r\nprivate life you will be welcomed by a host who have preceded you\r\nand who will selfishly rejoice.\r\n\r\nMy gayest greetings to Sir William and, in cloudy Holland, may the\r\nsun shine in your hearts always.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K.

Truly you should write up what you see. Get good\r\npictures and I will get it all in the National Geographic\r\nMagazine, and then we'll see what the Cosmos Club will say! I am\r\nin earnest about this--keep a diary in which you write, in your\r\nown gay style, what you see, and you will soon have fame as well\r\nas fortune.\r\n\r\nThe news from Mexico is not very encouraging. Obregon is sick so\r\nmuch, and without policy, without dependable friends. Cardinal\r\nGibbons came near dying, but, thank God, pulled through! A very\r\nwonderful man. I am very fond of him and he likes me I know, for I\r\nhandled the Indians for seven years and had no trouble, because he\r\nand I had a flat understanding that I should take my church\r\ntroubles, if any arose, to him.\r\n\r\nThe old Chief Justice called on us in Washington. He is seventy-\r\nfive and almost totally blind. And the greatest Chief since John\r\nMarshall.\r\n\r\nDe Valera has landed and I expect things to be doing pretty soon.\r\nThe British are greatly mystified as to how he got over and back.\r\nYou see you are not the only adventurer on the face of the globe.\r\nWe used to think that these were prosey, stoggy, flat-footed days,\r\nbut there is any amount of adventure--from the fields of Flanders\r\nto the mountains of Colombia--even the Spanish main has had its\r\nrebirth.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lane wants me to thank you for your thought of her. As you\r\nknow no one holds a deeper, surer place in her heart than you and\r\nTim.\r\n\r\nWell, old chap, I am sitting in bed--four in the morning--with a\r\ndevilish sore throat and without anything to eat or much sleep for\r\nthirty-six hours, so if this screed is not one of great\r\nillumination or information you will know that it was only a\r\nmessage of cheer and good-will from one who is fond of you, but\r\nwho warns you to be careful for all of our sakes. As always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo William R. Wheeler\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, January 13, [1921]\r\n\r\nDEAR BILL,--Off to see you eventually, I trust, tomorrow. Had my\r\ntonsils out, won't do anything else till Spring. Meantime I want\r\nto see no doctors. Having tried twenty, and come \"out by that same\r\ndoor wherein I went.\" An osteopath, yes. Faith cure--Indian\r\nMedicine men--anything else, but no doctors! I turn from\r\nEsculapius to Zoroaster, from medicine to the sun. I want to \"lie\r\ndown for an aeon or two.\" (Alice knows where that comes from.)\r\nWith much love to you both.\r\n\r\nFRANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo V. C.

Angina\r\npectoris they call it, but where it comes from they don't say,\r\nthey don't know. Am off to California for a couple of months, then\r\nprobably back to New York.\r\n\r\nI have read Wells' History, which seems to me the most remarkable\r\nthing of the historical essay kind ever hit off; and therein I\r\ndiscovered your friend Asoka, but I have been able to learn little\r\nelse about him.\r\n\r\nBuddhism attracts me greatly, as perhaps the most perfect attitude\r\non the negative side that has ever been developed and largely\r\nlived. It is not complete for a temperate zone people, who are and\r\nmust be aggressive. Nor does it reveal, so far as I know, the\r\nspiritual possibilities that Christianity does. The constructive\r\nseems to be lacking. But it is so far ahead of the purely\r\nopportunist attitude that Christianity takes that I should like to\r\nbe a Buddhist, I verily believe.\r\n\r\nI see that Lord Reading goes to India. He is the greatest of\r\ndiplomats, an oriental by nature, and will do good, if good can be\r\ndone in that unhappy situation. I admire the cheerful way Lloyd\r\nGeorge keeps. He is a great man. Each six months I have looked to\r\nsee him fall, but he keeps up, even with Ireland, India, Egypt,\r\nSouth Africa on his back.\r\n\r\nTell me what you are doing now, anything beside writing, and\r\nwriting what next? I wish that I had the literary endowment--\r\nideas, plus style, plus energy. Good fortune to you always.\r\nCordially yours,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter sent to several friends\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, January 10, 1921\r\n\r\n\"And when they came upon the Snark, they found it was a Boojum--or\r\nwords to that effect--and so, my dear Jack, they couldn't operate\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThere is the whole story. Details there are, of course. But\r\nMeissonier's style never did appeal to me. After peering into, and\r\nprobing, all known and unknown parts of the Mortal Man, they found\r\nthat the heart in one part changed its polarity,--turned over, by\r\nGeorge, or tried to,--hence the Devil's clutch. But why did it do\r\nthis vaudevillian act? Bugs, bugs, of course. But where? So they\r\nchased them to their lair in that wicked, nasty-named and most\r\nvulgar organ known as the gall-bladder. Damn the gall-bladder! Out\r\nit must come! On with the knifing! But soft, not so swift. Suppose\r\nthe heart should try to play its funny stunt in the midst of the\r\noperation? Or suppose again in this icy weather, pneumonia should\r\nensue and the naughty heart should take to turning? Eh, what then,\r\nmy brave Bucko? \"No,\" they said, \"We are experts in eliminating\r\nthis same appropriately named organ from the system--eight\r\nthousand times have we done it. It is a twenty-five minute job, A\r\nmere turn of the wrist and out the viper comes. And it never comes\r\nback! This is positively its last appearance, save as a memento\r\nfor the morbid-minded in a bottle of alcohol. But hearts that do\r\nsomersaults and lungs that choke up, fill us with fear. So out\r\nwith the tonsils where bugs accumulate and men decay, and then off\r\nwith you to California where bugs degenerate and men rejuvenate.\r\nThen come back when the sun shines and the trees begin to burgeon\r\nand the trick will be done. Hold yourself where you are, grow\r\nbetter if you can, and we'll have to take the risk of the tumbling\r\nheart, but the pneumonia risk will be gone.\"\r\n\r\nThus saith the Prophets! And this day, therefore, will be spent\r\nwith the Master of the mysterious fluoroscope, who reverses Edward\r\nEverett Hale and looks \"in and not out,\" and with the dentist who\r\nmust fill a pesky tooth, and then with the surgeon who tears out\r\ntonsils. Rather a full day, eh? And after two days in hospital, or\r\nthree, over the hills to 8 Chester Place, Los Angeles,--by no\r\nmeans a poor-house,--but alas! carrying the malevolent bugs and\r\ntheir nesting place with me. Then I shall rest, \"and faith I shall\r\nneed it, lie down for an aeon or two, till the Master of all good\r\nworkmen shall put me to work anew.\"\r\n\r\nI am disappointed. I would take the risk if it were left to me.\r\nBut I shall go West--why did those soldier boys ever use that\r\nphrase with such sinister meaning, or did it signify a better land\r\nto them? I shall go West in good hope that I shall return, and\r\nmeantime will try to develop a strong propaganda in favor of race\r\nsuicide in the land of the bothering bacteria, Adios.\r\n\r\nF. K.

Gehring\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, January 13, [1921]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR PADRE,--I wrote you an impressionistic sketch of what the\r\npoliticians call the \"local situation,\" a couple of days since.\r\n... It is subject to attack on every possible ground as to\r\ndetails, for no man can know from it what these doctors found. But\r\nit is a perfect picture from the artist's standpoint, because it\r\nproduces the result on the viewer or reader that is truth, and\r\nthat result is a large, purple befuddlement. I am whole, but I\r\nhave a pain. ...\r\n\r\nAfter I had practically been declared one hundred per cent\r\npluperfect I gave the electric cardiograph man a picture or\r\nexhibition performance under an attack. This revealed to him a\r\nchange in polarity in the current passing through, which signified\r\nsomething, but what that something was, other than that I was\r\nhaving a spasm, I don't know. ...\r\n\r\nThe smug, mysterious gentleman who made this picture was much\r\npleased, apparently at nothing more than that he had proved that I\r\nhad a clutch of the heart, which I had announced, by wire, before\r\narriving here.\r\n\r\nAm I impatient or am I a damn fool?\r\n\r\nWell, with my tonsils out I am in Royal Baking Powder condition\r\nand tomorrow we start for California. I cannot hope to be out\r\nthere till May or June, when you would come. But Heaven knows I'd\r\nlike to introduce you to the Yosemite! ...\r\n\r\nDo you know I am beginning to admire myself. Now many have thought\r\nthat that was my favorite sport. But I can assure you that no one\r\never felt more humble than I have, any appearance to the contrary\r\nbeing a bluff for success--effect. But now that I have been wisely\r\nand scrupulously and unscrupulously examined by the most exalted\r\nrulers of the Inner Temple, and they pronounce me all that man\r\nshould be, why shouldn't I strut some? But, damn it, strutting\r\nbrings that Devil's clutch--and a man cannot be anything more\r\nstrutty than a dish-rag then. In William James you will find a\r\nquestionnaire, \"Why do I believe in immortality? 'Because I think\r\nI'm just about ready to begin to live.'\" There speaks self-\r\njustifying age--I'm there, too.\r\n\r\nI'd love to look on Bethel this morning, and see what your poet-\r\npartner calls the hills in their wine bath.

First question, as\r\nto men and women for the Executive Committee,\r\n\r\nAnswer: Get men who can make a program, something that the party\r\ncan push, outside Congress, if too cowardly in. People who don't\r\nwant anything, if possible.\r\n\r\nThink of these! (I don't say they will do, but they stand for\r\nsomething.)\r\n\r\nCharles W. Eliot. Benjamin Ide Wheeler. (Ex-President of the\r\nUniversity of California. Ex-Chairman, Democratic Committee,\r\nElmira, New York.) E. M. House. Frank L Cobb. John W. Davis.\r\nRobert Lansing. R. Walton Moore. (Congressman from Virginia, big\r\nfellow.) Gavin McNab. Governor Parker, of Louisiana. James D.\r\nPhelan. Van-Lear Black.\r\n\r\nFor solid thought I'd choose out of that bunch--Eliot and Moore.\r\nFor cleverness--Black and McNab. For diplomacy--House and Davis.\r\nFor progressiveness--House and Parker. For Conservative Democracy\r\n--Wheeler and Lansing. For writing ability--Cobb and Eliot.\r\n\r\nI know no women who think, particularly. ...\r\n\r\nThe kind of publicity we need is the advocacy by the National\r\nCommittee, and by Democrats in Congress of first class measures,\r\nknown to be Democratic measures, part of a program.\r\n\r\nI'll tell you how to get all the publicity you want when I see\r\nyou--or White--a new kind, cheap, but requiring brains. ...\r\n\r\nF. K L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Lathrop Brown\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, January, [1921]\r\n\r\nDEAR LATHROP,--(1) You are right as to standardization. The Devil\r\ndevised it as a highway to socialism. It is the Bible of the great\r\nTribe of Flatfoot, not for artists like you and myself. And\r\nspeaking of programs, please read what Wells says in his first\r\nvolume of Outline of History, on David, Solomon, Moses. It will\r\ndelight your anti-semitic soul. ...\r\n\r\nYes, standardization is like all else, good--for a distance. The\r\nwhole bally outfit of life is a matter of balance, maintained by\r\nwar among the unintelligent bacilli and other primitives, and by\r\nwill among men (goat feed for men, eh?) But do you get my point?\r\nSomething to it!\r\n\r\n(2) George White will be eaten up first thing he knows, unless he\r\nmoves. Your friend McAdoo is here declining the next nomination\r\ndaily, speaking much, and, I understand, well. ... Why doesn't G.\r\nW. get Frank Cobb and Hooker, of the Springfield Republican, and\r\nVan-Lear Black, and Senator Walsh, and Phelan, and Congressman\r\nWalton Moore together, or any other group, and put up his plan and\r\nask them what they think of it tentatively,--just a quiet chat,\r\nbut start.\r\n\r\nHe doesn't need to resign, if he can get someone as a quiet\r\norganizer \"who will give all his time\" to take up that job under\r\nhim, with sub-organizers. Who is this genius who can organize\r\ninorganic matter, and give it life? Thought He was dead sometime!\r\n\r\n\"Wanted--A Miracle Man who can overcome a majority of seven\r\nmillion votes with a hearty handshake and a warm brown eye. Need\r\nhave no program, no money. Must be a hypnotist who can make the\r\npeople forget a few things and believe a few things that are not\r\ntrue. Must be able by reciting poetry to make the cunning\r\ncapitalist see that he is safer in the hands of the Democrats than\r\nelsewhere, and at the same time educate the worker by a pass of\r\nthe hand to know that it is decent to stay bought. Must have\r\nreceived the Gift of Tongues on the Day of Pentecost, so as to\r\ntalk Yiddish, in New York; Portuguese and Gaelic, in\r\nMassachusetts; Russian and German, in Chicago; Scandinavian, in\r\nthe Northwest; Cotton and Calhoun, in the South; John Brown and\r\nwheat, in Kansas; gold and Murphy, on 14th Street; and translate\r\nJesus Christ into Bolshevism, Individualism, Capitalism, Lodgeism,\r\nWilsonism! Must be as honest as old Cleveland and as clear of\r\npurpose as Abraham Lincoln.\"\r\n\r\nPut this want ad. in the papers and send me, by freight car, the\r\nreplies. With my warmest,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Adolph C. Miller\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, January 26, [1921]\r\n\r\nDEAR ADOLPH,--I see that Harding [Footnote: Governor Harding of\r\nthe Federal Reserve Board--a rumor of resignation.] is to leave\r\nyou, and this is a note of sympathy. What will you do? Poor chap!\r\nI know the satisfaction you have had out of working with him and\r\nnow he follows Warburg, Delano, and Strauss. By Jove, that's why\r\nwe can't make things go as other countries do--because we can't\r\ngive our people enough to live on. This is at once the meanest and\r\nmost generous of Republics. Mean collectively, generous\r\nindividually.\r\n\r\nHe will wait until after March 4th. \"Right oh!\" I expect you to\r\nhave some say as to his successor, especially as to the new\r\nGovernor. And if you can't work with the new man you can lift your\r\nskirts and skip! Freedom of movement, assured as to all by Adam\r\nSmith, is exclusively the prerogative of the fortunate few. Don't\r\nbe downhearted! You can't be as badly off as you were for several\r\nyears. Just think how unlucky I am as compared with you, and pat\r\nyourself on the back and take one of the old time struts. Good\r\nbelly! Good brains! Good pocket-book! Good friends near you! Good\r\ndog to walk with in the woods--and woods in which you can walk!\r\nGood house, with your own books to look at you friendly-like. Oh\r\nboy, rejoice and be glad!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFebruary 17, [1921]\r\n\r\nWe are most terribly disappointed. Your promised visit was a\r\nbright spot,--a sunshiny place--to which we have looked forward as\r\nto nothing else since we came here. Well, life is a series of such\r\njars, and child-like I submit, but am not reconciled.\r\n\r\n... Are you coming later? How is Mary? We really seem far away\r\nfrom our friends. The land is beautiful, but friends convert a\r\nshack into a palace, a desert into a heaven.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John G. Gehring\r\n\r\nPasadena, near Paradise, February 18\r\n\r\nBefore breakfast this morning, indeed before dressing, I sent you\r\na message which was a combined confession, apologia, report, and\r\nappeal. I said, \"I have done wrong, I apologize, I am slightly\r\nbetter, and I hope and pray you will not become downhearted.\" I\r\nalso promised to write and here I am at it. But you would have had\r\nthis letter just as early anyway, for this morning was to be yours\r\nand mine. All other mornings for two weeks and more have belonged\r\nto someone else. I have been pretending to work, by going to the\r\noffice each day. And last night I said good-bye to the Napoleon of\r\nour institution, who took his private car and rolled away to\r\nMexico, to Galyeston first, thence by private yacht to Tampico,\r\nthere to see his properties and spend two or three weeks.\r\n\r\n... They desired us to go greatly, and ours would have been every\r\npossible comfort that one can have while traveling, ... but the\r\ntyrant Anne thought that as I was picking up a bit it was wrong to\r\nchange conditions, and I yielded, hardly against my judgment, but\r\nstrongly against my desire.\r\n\r\nSo here I am, the first hour after release, sitting on the porch\r\nof a villa, looking across a valley at amethyst mountains, crowned\r\nwith a sprinkling of blue and white snow. The noises that come to\r\nme are not raucous;--the twitter of birds, a rooster crowing, a\r\nwell-pump throbbing its heart out, the shouts of some children at\r\nplay, a distant school bell, with no silver in its alloy, however,\r\nthe swish of a wood-sawing machine in some back-yard. So my ears\r\nare not lonesome. Immediately before me is the gray-lavender bole\r\nof a tall eucalyptus, not a leaf or branch for fifty feet, and\r\nthen a drooping cascade of blue-green feathers. Beyond it a few\r\nfeet a red-blue eucalyptus, sturdy, branching almost at the ground\r\nand in blossom. These stand near the border of a drive which is\r\nmarked by a cypress hedge, trimmed and proper, and beyond the\r\ndrive, on the front of the terrace are magnolia and iron-wood and\r\navocado and palm and spruce, rising up out of beds of carnations\r\nand geraniums, jasmine and pansies (all violet), and cherokee\r\nroses, five-petaled, white with golden centers, and rose colored--\r\n(the wild rose with a university education, a year or two in\r\nItaly, and the care of a good maid). While beyond this terrace are\r\norange, and tangerine, and lemon, and grapefruit with their green,\r\nyellow, and deep red-golden fruit pendant; and still further on, a\r\nfringe of blossoming pear trees tell you that this is not the\r\ntropics after all. The breeze is a gentle woman's hand, a soft\r\ntouch, kindly, tender, emotional, but not disturbing. It is not\r\nlotus-eating time. I don't know that that time ever comes here.\r\nAutos whisk through the woods, buildings are going up, the air is\r\ndry and has tang; it has challenge in it, but it does not give off\r\nthe heady champagne of the air that the snow breathes out on your\r\nMillbrook hillside.\r\n\r\nI remember as I looked from my window at the sunset at Bethel\r\nsaying to myself, \"Can there be any fairer spot than this?\" And\r\nthis morning as I saw the sun rise into the pink and blue of the\r\nsky, empurpling the shadowed hills and splashing rose leaves on\r\nthe snowy mountains, I again said \"Is there anything lovelier,\r\nanywhere?\" Great blessing, these catholic eyes! Should the heart\r\nbe equally catholic? There is a real problem in philosophy and\r\nsociology for you!\r\n\r\nAnd now that you know how happily circumstanced I am as to\r\nenvironment your doctorial demand is for something as to the\r\nbehavior of the organs and nerves which we call the physical man.\r\nWell, I can't tell you much. I do not rise and walk half a block\r\nwithout that trigger being pulled, but the explosion is not\r\ndynamite, rather poor black powder, I should say. If I walk half a\r\ndozen blocks I stop a half a dozen times, and once or twice nibble\r\nat a precious pellet of nitro. At night I am wakened as of yore,\r\nbut the agonizing, crushing pains do not come every night. ... I\r\neat prunes and bran biscuit and coffee for breakfast; a bit of\r\ncooked fruit (and that in this land of oranges and alligator pears\r\nand ripe raspberries!), chicken and green peas, and bran biscuit\r\nand tea for lunch; a couple of green vegetables and bran biscuit\r\nand a small black, for dinner. And all this I write with a supreme\r\nsense of virtue, which Simon Stylites or St. Benedict could not\r\nmore than parallel. As to smoking--a pipe, generous in size but of\r\nthe mildest possible tobacco, after breakfast. A mild, large cigar\r\nafter lunch, and pause here and worship--no cigar after dinner.\r\n(But this latter is a Lenten innovation. I would not have you\r\nthink I am preparing for immediate ascension.)\r\n\r\nAs to treatment, an osteopath and a Christian Scientist are my\r\npresent complement. Each morning the former, and each evening the\r\nlatter. The former to gratify myself, the latter to gratify a dear\r\nfriend who \"believed and was saved.\" The osteo is rational, the C.\r\nS., with limitations and reservations. ...\r\n\r\nThe C. S. is a woman, the sister of an artist I used to know. If\r\nshe did not ask or expect that I believe certain things, we would\r\nget on better. I can believe in God as the Principle of Life, that\r\nseems scientific. I am willing to call Him Spirit, that is\r\nChristian. That He is Supreme in the Universe, I admit. That sin\r\nand sickness may with further light be overmastered I do not deny;\r\nphysical death, of course, seems to me a thing not worth bothering\r\nabout. But that God is all good, I cannot asseverate in the living\r\npresence of a few Devils whom I know, unless I deny that He is\r\nomnipresent and omnipotent, or unless I say that Bad is Good. God\r\ncannot be good and all powerful without being also responsible for\r\nBad, and therefore be both Good and Bad. This I can believe, and\r\nit brings me to Emerson's transcendentalism, which is set forth in\r\nthe Sphinx--\"Deep Love lieth under these pictures of Time, which\r\nfade in the light of their meaning sublime.\" In a word we are\r\ngrowing into the Good. The Bad is not the ultimate, but is none\r\nthe less real. This is better than Manicheism, the Miltonian\r\ncontest between the Good Spirit and the Bad, which Wells also in\r\nhis Invisible King presents; a simple theory, understandable but\r\nnot to my mind subject to careful scrutiny. There is but one God,\r\none Force, one Principle, one Spirit, and it is working its way\r\nthrough, expressing itself as best it can. And Evil is a partial\r\nview, one phase of undevelopment, the muck through which, by God's\r\nown law, we must come; and indeed He could not have sent us any\r\nother way. This means that He is bound, too. Is this supposable?\r\nOmnipresent? Yes! All pervading! In all! But Omnipotent? No, not\r\nin the sense that He could change the Order of Things, for He is\r\nthe Order of Things Himself. Is there even in Him complete Freedom\r\nof Will, freedom to make a world other than this? One wishes, in a\r\nsense, to say so, but the horror of it! for then He is responsible\r\nfor the cruelty of the ant-heap, the feeding of the carnivorous\r\nupon the vegetable eaters, the preying and persecution of the\r\nmalevolent upon the kindly--and He could have made it all\r\notherwise! With a Free Will He could have brought growth without\r\npain, being omnipotent. Here we see God as a monster,--responsible\r\nfor sweat shops and the Marne, in the sense that His will could\r\nhave averted these things. So I say God is not Good, save in the\r\nsense that He is that sunrise this morning. But night cometh, when\r\nthieves break through and steal. More sunlight--that is the\r\nmeaning of the phrase \"God is Good\"--a belief in a tendency, in\r\nthe temporality of darkness, of night, a sureness that the day\r\nwill come and \"There will be no night there.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a long disquisition, but I just had to get it out of my\r\nsystem; yet I can't, it bothers, and confuses, and perplexes, and\r\nhinders, I believe. Better brush it away for practical purposes\r\nand have the Will to Believe, for thence cometh strength.\r\nPragmatically C. S. works out with certain people; and to them it\r\nis Truth. I wish it were so with my doubting mind, that I could\r\nbelieve. I am willing to be cured tho' I do not understand and\r\ncannot believe, and this they say they can do. But it has not been\r\ndone with me.\r\n\r\nLunch broke into this discourse, and then a walk. This time on the\r\nother side of the house, the other side of the hill. There I found\r\na new world. Palms, huge ones, thirty feet across, with their dead\r\nbranches strewing the ground, making a coarse woven carpet; and\r\npines, large ones, yet not so gigantic as yours on the road beyond\r\nthe creek; and acacia in full golden bloom, glorious, yet modest\r\ntree, a very rare, non-self-assertive tree, a truly Christian\r\ntree, beautiful but not prideful. Bamboo in great clumps, erect,\r\nyielding but not to be broken--wise, tenacious orientals! And I\r\nwalked on the off-cast seed of the pepper, and beside cacti higher\r\nthan my head with spears of crimson, and across a sweep of lawn\r\nover which oranges had been dropped, by the generosity of an up-\r\nhill row of trees that were saying, \"We must make room for the\r\nnext generation.\" The flowers (oxalis) and leaves I enclose made a\r\nmat, close clinging to the earth, a mat of white, red, and\r\nlavender resting on these clover-like leaves that rested in turn\r\ndirectly on the ground. And all about, a hundred plants I did not\r\nknow, into which my footsteps sent quail and rabbit, that did not\r\nfear me really but could not quite say that Man is Love.\r\n\r\nI have written you a long line, may it serve for a time as a word\r\nalso to your dear Lady, whose letter and rare bit of verse I have\r\nalso received. I do hope that you soon master whatever ails you.\r\nDon't lose faith in yourself, above all things. Believe that you\r\nare all that your friends believe you to be--a Civilized Medicine\r\nMan. Be as deluded as we are. Affectionately,\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John W. Hallowell\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, February 21, 1921 MY DEAR JACK,--It is Sunday\r\nmorning, very early; the sun is trying to get out of bed, a\r\nmocking bird is hailing its effort with great gurgling. I am\r\nsitting near an open window looking down into orange trees, which\r\nare a very dark shadow, and I am just as happy in my heart as I\r\ncan be with a bum heart, and no home, and a scattered family. But\r\n--! Bad word that \"but.\"\r\n\r\nRoots we all have and we must not be torn up from them and flung\r\nabout as if we were young things that could take hold in any soil.\r\nI have been, all America has been, too indifferent to roots--home\r\nroots, school roots, work roots. ... We should love stability and\r\ntradition as well as love adventure and advancement.\r\n\r\nYour new job interests me, but I wonder if you will go with the\r\nSecretary of Commerce [Hoover], ... I guess he did right. But\r\nunless he gets to be the leading adviser he'll have to get out.\r\nFor I'm afraid we are to see too much politics--Republican\r\nBurlesonism in the saddle. Government by unanimous consent is not\r\npracticable, and it looked as if this were Harding's motto until\r\nHoover's appointment. Hoover will be the man to whom the country\r\nwill look for some guidance along progressive lines, and the\r\ncountry will expect too much, more than any man can deliver.\r\n\r\nPlease tell your dear Mother that I have her book, and last night\r\nread two chapters. I know Bok and did not think him capable of\r\nsuch a literary work, or that he had such character as his book\r\nreveals. ... My love to the Troop, and write just as often as you\r\ncan.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Curt G. Pfeiffer\r\n\r\nPasadena, 22 [February, 1921]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR OLD PFEIFFER,--I have treated you shamefully. Yes, I have,\r\ndon't protest! But I have been pretending to be busy. Mr. Doheny\r\nwanted me to go to Mexico, and Anne did not want me to go, and I\r\nhave had a hard time. They have gone and we have come out here\r\nwith Mrs. Severance, in the loveliest hillside spot you ever saw.\r\nFlowers and trees all about and mountains in the distance.\r\nWonderful land!\r\n\r\nTo-day I celebrated G. W.'s birthday by taking on a new doctor.\r\n... Thought I had escaped from doctors but it is not so to be. ...\r\n\r\nThis is all my news. I do wish I were there to talk politics with\r\nyou. Poor Harding! He will suffer the politicians, I fear, till\r\nthey undo him. ...\r\n\r\nThe Germans seem to have recovered their audacity. They should\r\nhave been driven into their own land and then some. I am not for\r\nrevenge nor for their paralyzing, but just reparation they should\r\npay. Perhaps things have been botched, I do not trust Briand. I'd\r\ntrust Hoover to get all they could pay, and he's the only one I\r\nknow who could be just and at the same time sensible in method,\r\nbut he can't be used where he should be used. ...\r\n\r\nMarch 31\r\n\r\n... You are a delight and joy to a thirsty man, a true water\r\ncarrier, you give of the water of life. For you know that men\r\nshall not live by bread alone. Not only words of wisdom, sage\r\ncounsel, come from you, but there is a heart behind which does not\r\nwane with the years, but on the contrary grows stronger and more\r\ngenerous. I look forward to returning to New York to be able once\r\nagain to feel with you the pleasure of an intellectual\r\ncompanionship, wherein the mind is so refined as to be emotionally\r\nsympathetic. You would take the greatest joy out of the beauty in\r\nwhich I am living. ... The night is fragrant (Do you remember\r\ntelling me of that Japanese criterion?) with orange, wisteria, and\r\njasmine. Oh, this is exquisite country, if I only had health! But\r\nthere is little beauty where pain is, and my pain holds on even\r\nwhen I was with my brother on his farm, eighty acres, south of San\r\nJose, tucked in the foothills--raises nothing but kindliness and\r\na few vegetables and some hay. It is the sweetest place in its\r\nspirit I have ever felt, and lovely physically, too. I wish I\r\ncould get you to go out there with me. Put up a comfortable adobe\r\non the knob of a hill with a wide prospect and then make things\r\ngrow, including our own souls. ...\r\n\r\nI'm going back there in a week or two, then East, I hope, to Ned's\r\nwedding. ... The girl is all a girl should be, I believe. Smaller\r\nthan he is, a tiny thing in fact, very gentle in voice and manner,\r\nsweet natured, musical, wholesome.\r\n\r\n... I still dream of that place on the Shepaug river, in\r\nConnecticut, where you think I would be lonesome. A winter here\r\nwith George and a summer there with you, would quite suit me. ...\r\nWell, write me, for books are not old friends after all, are they?\r\nForever and ever yours,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nWriting of the days of their youth Pfeiffer said later,\r\n\"Friendships are inexplicable, they defy analysis, but whatever it\r\nwas that we might be doing, we were usually in harmony about it. I\r\ncan only explain it by saying that we liked each other. We liked\r\neach other just as we were, and we knew each other with intimacy\r\nthat deepened with the years, and never disappointed us. The magic\r\ncircle came later to include others, and they were accepted and\r\nappreciated with the same affection and trust. ... It is a\r\nsingular and beautiful thing that such a multiple and intimate\r\nrelationship should have survived throughout all of our lives.\r\nPerhaps it was because we were friends without capitulation. ...\r\n\r\n\"Some of us did not meet again, after that first period, for\r\nyears, but whenever we did meet, it was always in the spirit of\r\nthe early days. A few words would tell us what we knew of the\r\nlatest doings of the rest, and we would then 'carry on' just as if\r\nthere had never been a break in our intercourse. The strength of\r\nour joint memories, based on our youthful experiences in common\r\nand added to from time to time, grew with the years.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John G. Gehring\r\n\r\nPasadena, February 24, [1921]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR DOCTOR-AND-MORE,--This is a note of cheer written by a\r\nsomewhat dolorous duffer who spent last night in pain, but this\r\nmorning is rather comfortable. ...\r\n\r\nAm reading William James' Varieties of Religious Experience, and\r\nit is really the most helpful religious or philosophical work I\r\nhave ever read. Nothing else anywhere near as good for the groping\r\nmind that wants to be led cautiously, reasonably, suggestively to\r\nthe \"Water of Life,\" but shown that there is water there. (Pretty\r\npoor figure, but perhaps understandable.) I must re-read his\r\nanswer to the questionnaire in his Letters, and compare it with\r\nhis conclusions in this book. You remember my thought that\r\nprobably Emerson, William James, and Henry George had been the\r\ngreatest writing minds we had produced. Probably you can improve\r\non this.\r\n\r\nHave been interested myself in thinking of a list of books that\r\nhave made great movements in the world, Darwin's Descent of Man,\r\nfor illustration. Books that have provoked the minds of men into\r\naction of one kind or another:--The Bible, Koran, in religions, of\r\ncourse! What started modern medicine? I mean in the way of a book?\r\n\r\nWhat are, or have been, the great movements in history, anyway?\r\nWars, of course, don't count, when merely predatory.\r\n\r\n    Man's relation to God.\r\n    Man's relation to the World.\r\n    Man's relation to Man.\r\n    Man's relation to the Good.\r\n    Man's relation to the True.\r\n    Man's relation to the Beautiful.\r\n\r\nThese ought to cover Art, Science, Philosophy, Religion, Progress.\r\nCivilization of every kind. And this progress has come in waves,\r\nhasn't it? Did any book start, or give evidence of the starting of\r\nthese waves? That's the question. Outside religion and philosophy\r\nbooks were the results not the causes of movements. How true is\r\nthat? As always and always,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo D. M. Reynolds\r\n\r\nPasadena, [February, 1921]\r\n\r\nI'm writing this late at night and will mail it in the morning,\r\nfor I'm going to Santa Barbara for a couple of days. Do with it\r\nwhat you will. Judge for me what it is wise to say. And be as\r\ncondensed as possible.\r\n\r\nWhat I've written is to be dropped in at the right places, it is\r\nnot conservative. Will see you next week, I hope, perhaps\r\nSaturday.\r\n\r\nF. K. LANE\r\n\r\nCooperation is the word of this century and we don't know what it\r\nmeans yet. We work together most imperfectly in things political,\r\nand we are just beginning to feel our way into the worlds of\r\nsocial and industrial life. I'm not afraid of socialism. I really\r\ndon't know anyone who is. We're all afraid of blundering attempts\r\nat getting a thing called by that name, which is a mechanical\r\nmethod of bringing the Kingdom of Heaven on earth, without\r\nchanging the human spirit.\r\n\r\nThe call for socialism or communism is generally a call for more\r\nof justice and of honesty and of fair dealing between men, rather\r\nthan a demand for any particular and organized method of carrying\r\non industrial life. If business is squarely conducted we won't try\r\nexperiments in mechanicalizing and sterilizing business. But a few\r\nmore years of profiteering, and Conservatives would have become\r\nReds.\r\n\r\nNow we should be studying and planning for a safer industrial\r\nlife, one in which there will be fewer waves, a safer and more\r\neven sea. That we can have, if we are willing to be less greedy\r\nnow, less venturesome and predatory.\r\n\r\nThe only people who have done much in the way of substantial\r\nthinking as to cooperative action, collective action, are those\r\nwho think in terms of immediate and large fortunes for themselves,\r\nthrough plans of capitalizing combined brains and money. Their\r\nexample is a good one to follow in lesser things, where the object\r\nis not great wealth but a more even measure of good living.\r\nInsurance is the right word for it, business life insurance\r\nthrough honest cooperation. You mark my word, that is the next big\r\nmove in business affairs. Nationalization of things is not their\r\nsocialization. Not at all. It may mean their deserialization,\r\ntheir withdrawal from the use of society altogether, or their more\r\nimperfect use. Calling things by nice names, popular alluring\r\nnames, does not solve problems. Nevertheless such names evidence\r\nour social dreams. We all feel that there must be more of justice\r\nin the economic world. But we don't want it at the expense of\r\nsociety, that is at our own expense, for that means Bolshevism and\r\nBolshevism is paralysis. ...\r\n\r\nOil is one of the fine forms of Power that we know, for many\r\npurposes the handiest. Industrially it is as indispensable and\r\nstaple as the soil itself. To lose faith in the future of oil--\r\nwhy, that's as unthinkable as to lose faith in your hands. Oil,\r\ncoal, electricity, what are these but multiplied and more\r\nadaptable, super-serviceable hands? They may temporarily be\r\nunemployed but the world can't go round without them.\r\n\r\nA slack time is always one of fear, never of confidence. And no\r\npolicies should be adopted in such an atmosphere. For the man who\r\ncan afford to take the long view these are great days. He can take\r\nup what others cannot carry. Better still he can prepare for the\r\ndemand of to-morrow, or the day after to-morrow--find more oil, if\r\nyou please, plan for its fuller use, as we are talking of oil, but\r\nthe principle applies to everything. Take the railroads. Their car\r\nshortage is mounting and their out-of-order equipment is way up.\r\nThis has always been so in hard times. But this is the very time\r\nwhen they should have plenty of money, to get road bed and\r\nequipment in perfect shape for to-morrow's rush. No, the nation\r\nwould do no better if it had the roads. Congress doesn't think\r\nahead two years. It is a reflector, not a generator. The fault is\r\nours.\r\n\r\nRight now the call in national affairs of every kind is for the\r\nlong view; we have use for the men who can see this nation in its\r\nrelation to other nations, next year and next generation, and for\r\nmen in business who can think in terms of 1922, and 1925, and\r\n1945. That's what really big business can do--hold its breath\r\nunder water and watch the waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Cordenio Severance\r\n\r\n[Pasadena, March, 1921]\r\n\r\nDEAR MAIDIE,--It is six in the morning. The sun is a long streak\r\nof salmon pink in a gray skirt of fog. Chanticleer is very loud\r\nand conquering. The little birds are twittering all about, in\r\nwisteria, in oranges; and over on the hillside, by the cherokee\r\nroses, there was a mocking bird that hailed the dawn, or its\r\npromise, an hour ago.\r\n\r\nAnd for all this beauty, this gay cheer, this soul-lifting day-\r\nbreaking I have you to thank. It is the one most exquisite spot in\r\nwhich I have ever laid my head. And pity is that I have been so\r\ndown-cast that I could not feel fully what was here, nor show what\r\nI did feel.\r\n\r\nForgive me for my many ungraciousnesses and credit yourself, I\r\nbeg, with having done all and everything that human hands and\r\nheart could do to make me \"come back.\"\r\n\r\nYou have spent a lifetime doing good, giving out of your heart,\r\nand the only reward you can get is the evidence of understanding\r\nin paltry words like these.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nTo Alexander Vogelsang Assistant Secretary of the Interior\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, March 4, [1921]\r\n\r\nDEAR ALECK,--The end has come. We were identified with an historic\r\nperiod, one of the great days of the world. And none can say that\r\nour part, of relatively slight importance maybe, was not well\r\nplayed. We did not strut and call the world to witness how well we\r\ndid. We did not voice indignation at injustice, and make heroes of\r\nourselves at the price of unity. And some things we did, and more\r\nwe tried to do, and all were good. So I look back over the eight\r\nyears with some personal satisfaction, for not a thing was done or\r\nattempted ... that was unworthy, ignoble, unpatriotic or little.\r\n\r\nI am glad to get news of the force, and sorry that I cannot have\r\nthem all round about me for the rest of my days. Had I been well I\r\nwould have been with you this morning, to bid you all good cheer.\r\nIt was my hope when I saw you in December that this might be.\r\n\r\nI like your plans for the future and, by the starry belt of Orion,\r\nI'd like to join you. ... I am stronger and look very well, but my\r\ndamn pains are about as frequent and crunching as ever. ... No one\r\ncan say that I have not fought a good fight and stood a lot of\r\npunishment. Good luck, dear Aleck.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James S. Harlan\r\n\r\nPasadena, March 5, [1921]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JIM,--That was a fine long letter in your old-time style,\r\nand I am doing the unprecedented thing of answering it promptly.\r\nTo this I am prompted by the near-by presence of a very handsome\r\nyoung woman formerly named Wyncoop, now Mays, who knows Mrs.\r\nHarlan well, having been much at the Crater Club. ... Who would\r\nhave thought such a thing possible--that here as I lie on a couch\r\nin a doctor's office with a rubber tube in my mouth, I should\r\nattract the curiosity of a baby who came to see the \"funny tube,\"\r\nand that she should be followed by a nice-looking, blue-eyed,\r\nbright-cheeked girl who says, \"I believe I saw you once at Lake\r\nChamplain. You know Mrs. Harlan.\"\r\n\r\nWell now, as George Harvey might say--\"One day After!\" I want to\r\nhelp in any way I can to make this administration a success. ...\r\nIf Hoover can work with Harding, or the latter with him, all will\r\nbe well. But I fear the politicians--especially ... [those]\r\nambitious for a great political machine. The country will be\r\ngenerous for a time to Harding. ... But it will turn against him\r\nwith anger unbounded if he turns the country over to the men who\r\nwant office and the men who want privilege and favor. The\r\npoliticians and the profiteers may be his undoing. I hope not!\r\n\r\n... I cannot close without a special word to that most gracious,\r\ntender, and charming Lady who is your \"sweet-heart.\" As I wander\r\nand see many, I find no limitation, no reservation, or\r\nmodification to put to that declaration of admiration and\r\ndevotion, which I made to Her now some fifteen years ago, nearly.\r\nTell her that this old, sick troubled man thinks nice things about\r\nher often. My affectionate regards to you, dear Jim.\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Adolph C. Miller\r\n\r\nMorgan Hill, March 9, [1921]\r\n\r\nWhen my eyes opened this morning they looked out upon a hillside\r\nof vivid green, like the tops of Monterey cypress, flecked with\r\nbits of darker green embroiderings, and behind this was green,\r\ntoo, but very dark, and it had great splashes of a green so dark\r\nthat they looked black--and my heart was glad. It was a common\r\nscene, nothing rarely beautiful about it. Fog enclosed the earth.\r\nThere was no sky. But I had known it as a boy, this same kind of a\r\npicture, and it went to this poor tired heart of mine and was like\r\nbalsam to a wound. By Jove, it is balsam! These hills are for the\r\nhealing of men. I have been here three days and have taken more\r\nexercise than in three months--walking and climbing; beside the\r\ncreek lined with great sycamores--alluvial soil, crumbles in your\r\nhand, and with our friend the gopher in it; and climbed up through\r\na bit of manzanita--big fellows, twenty feet high some of them--\r\nand such a rich brown, near-burgundy red! I barked a bit of the\r\nbole to get that green beneath, spring green, great contrast!\r\n\r\nAnd above the grove of manzanita was a flat top to the hill, from\r\nwhich I could see three ways, and all ending in cloud-wrapped\r\nmountains, that had shape and were blue of some kind, as far as\r\nyou could see. Ah man, this is a glorious land--even the people!\r\nAlong the road I talked to Lundgren, who used to be a ship-\r\ncarpenter, but he had a prune orchard here \"since the fire.\" I\r\nmust \"see his horses,\" great snuzzling monsters that he had raised\r\nhimself (sold one of them once, and sneaked off and bought it\r\nback) and his calves, twins out of a three-year-old--and she had\r\nhad one before. Oh shades of Teddy Roosevelt, there's your ideal!\r\n(Do you remember Kipling's line in the Mary Gloster, \"And she\r\ncarried her freight each trip\"?)\r\n\r\nAnd next to Lungren was the Frenchman--far up on the hill\r\ncultivating his grapes, for which he got $110 per ton last year--\r\nand this year he puts out five acres more. The Frenchman has\r\nindigestion and lives alone ... that hillside of vines gives him\r\nsomething to love.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the turn in the road, where you cross the creek to\r\nclimb the hill, there the \"Portugee\" lives. He always has lived\r\nthere. He was found just there when the Padres came. And his name\r\nwas Silva. John Silva, of Stevenson's Treasure Island--born in the\r\nAzores, of course--there are no other Portuguese in America.\r\n\r\nAnd John has--how many children? Give you three guesses. All by\r\none wife, too, and she is in evidence, and a native daughter. I\r\nsaw her with my own eyes, black hair, dark skin, slight figure,\r\nvoluble, smiling, large-knuckled hands and a flashy eye, oh! a\r\nlong way from being uninteresting to John yet, or a merely \"good\r\nwoman.\" Well, how many children did they have, right there by the\r\nroad?--eleven. Eight boys and three girls--and four dead, too.\r\nFine boys and girls, one I saw plowing or cultivating straight up\r\nand down the vineyard, a sixty degree hill, I should say. I was\r\nstruggling with a cane to get one foot before another on the\r\nsloping road and he was outdoing a horse, that he drove with his\r\nneck and shoulders, while with his hands he guided the little plow\r\nstraight up toward the sky. I am not envious of such youth. I\r\nnever had it. I was always lazy. But it is a real joy for me to be\r\nnear such youth--just to know that such things can be done--by\r\nangels from the Azores. You remember Anne's story, \"In future it\r\nis prohibited to refer to our beloved Allies as 'the God-damned\r\nPortuguese'\"? Well, I feel the same way.\r\n\r\nYes, this land of yours is good. (All land is good, I believe.)\r\nAnd the stillness, and the birds, and the flowers! The simplicity\r\nof these two dear hearts--George and his wife--the little they\r\nneed! A paper once a day for five minutes, a song to break day\r\nwith, and a round of songs and piano pieces to end the day, every\r\nact one of consideration, and each word spoken with a tender look,\r\na gay lilt to the voice, even in asking to pass the salt. \"Better\r\na dinner of herbs where love is,\" etc. Well, they have it, herbs\r\nand all,--beet tops and mustard leaves. ... Good luck to you.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nP. S. You don't deserve this--you stingy, skimpy mollusk!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Lathrop Brown\r\n\r\nMorgan Hill, [March] 16, [1921]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LATHROP,--I wish I could be with you just to laugh away\r\nthat cynical mood. I know that I do not see the world undressed,\r\nnaked, in the raw, as you youngsters do. Illusions and delusions,\r\nlet them be! I shall cherish them. For whatever it is inside of me\r\nthat I call soul seems to grow on these things that seem so\r\ncontrary to the results of experience. \"If a lie works, it's the\r\ntruth,\" says Dooley. So say I, in my pragmatism. I have \"become\"\r\nin the eyes of men and I want to \"become\" in the eyes of my better\r\nself, that ego must be gratified at least by an effort. And to\r\n\"become\" requires that there shall be some faith. We don't\r\naccomplish by disbelieving. That is your Mother's religion. It is\r\nmy philosophy. She has capacity for faith which I have not,\r\nbecause she climbs, while I stand still.\r\n\r\nOf course the inauguration business was commonplace. That is Ohio\r\nstatesmanship, somehow. But good may come of it, and you and I\r\nwant to help it, so far as it wants national food, to bear fruit.\r\nDamn all your politics and partisanship! Humbug--twaddle--fiddle-\r\ndee-dee, made for lazy louts who want jobs and bosses who want\r\npower. Well, we are out now for a long time, and we might as well\r\nforget bitterness, or rather submerge it in the bigger call of the\r\nnation. All of which you characterize as sentimentalism--so says\r\nBurleson, too.\r\n\r\nI am beginning to despair of doctors and to say to myself, \"Better\r\nget back to work, and go it as long as you can, then quit and live\r\non rolled oats and buttermilk until the light goes out.\" ... Well,\r\ngoodnight, dear chap.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John G. Gekring\r\n\r\n[March] 21, [1921]\r\n\r\nAnd how are you, Padre? Do you find that there are those who can\r\nprobe into the secrets within you and tell more than you as\r\npatient can tell yourself? Has a physician who follows the\r\nbiblical advice, \"Heal thyself,\" a Fool for a Doctor? What has\r\nbeen taught you in the ill-smelling center of darkness, dreariness\r\nand torture, where there is more need for beauty than in any other\r\nplace, and less of it, more need for gaiety, and less of it, more\r\nneed for wholesome suggestion and less of it? ... All hospitals\r\nshould have bright paper on the walls, or bright pictures. To hell\r\nwith the microbe theory! There are worse things than microbes. All\r\nnurses should be good-looking. They should paint and pad, if\r\nnecessary, to give an imitation of good looks. Now, honestly, do\r\nyou not agree? And they should not have doors open, nor ask\r\nperfunctory silly questions, such as \"Well, how are we today?\"\r\n\r\nOn examination nurses should be rated largely for things that\r\ndon't count--looks, cheerfulness, silliness, sympathy, softness of\r\nhand, willingness to listen to the victim-patient! ...\r\n\r\nI am going to Rochester, ... my brother is going with me. Bless\r\nhim! He'd be glad to take you back, and he can give you wood to\r\nchop, and a black-headed grosbeak to sing for you. Ever hear one?\r\nBetter than Caruso.\r\n\r\nMay the Lord make his light to shine upon you and give you peace.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John H. Wigmore\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, March 25, 1921\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JOHN,--Hail to you brave leader of the Moral Forces! Isn't\r\nthat an offensive title? You see I have been asked to join you in\r\n\"Potentia.\" Isn't that word out of the Middle Ages?\r\n\r\nI would like to join against crooks, thieves, and liars. But the\r\nAmerican people don't like anyone to assume that he represents the\r\nMoral Forces. And \"Potentia\" sounds too mystic for any land this\r\nside of Egypt. Am I not right? Answer in one of your sane moments.\r\nYou cannot go against ridicule in America. Bishops here are not\r\nthe same as Lords in England. They cannot save from ridicule\r\npretentious good things. Now Ross and you are wise things. How do\r\nyou stand for \"Moral Forces\" and \"Potentia\"? No, no, dear John!--\r\nless hifalutism!\r\n\r\nI write for information. Tell me--do you think good will come of\r\nit? My immediate judgment is against it, strongly. In purpose--\r\ngood, in method, name,--impossible. It is as if one were to say,\r\n\"Come let us gather together the Good and the Wise, and say who\r\nshall be called honest men.\" Cicero, I believe, formed government\r\nby the \"boni.\" No one likes the good who advertise. I don't. Am I\r\nall wrong? ...\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt\r\n\r\n[Pasadena], March 25, [1921]\r\n\r\nYour letters, my dear Mrs. Franklin, are refreshing breezes. They\r\nare quite what breezes should be--warm, kindly, stimulating; not\r\nhard, stiff, compelling things, off a granite Northern shore. Anne\r\nrejoices in them, without words.\r\n\r\nI have been lately with my one brother on his ranch--a large name\r\nimplying vast herds quietly grazing over infinite valleys and\r\nmountains. But all farms here are ranches, as you doubtless know,\r\nas all weather is fine. My brother's ranchita is eighty acres of\r\nbeauty; a stream below, running up to manzanita crowns on good-\r\nsized hills, and oaks and sycamores and bays, and many other trees\r\nbetween. He has a house, all of which he planned in fullest detail\r\nhimself, with as lovely a site as anywhere, and a pretty and\r\nartistic wife; a good saddle horse, a noble dog, a loyal and most\r\nexcellent cook, many books--and what more could he have in heaven?\r\nOutside his dining-room window he has built a dining-table for the\r\nbirds, and so as we dined within, they dined without. Each morning\r\nI saw the sun rise, and I whistled as I dressed. One morning I\r\nclimbed the hills and found the cow and drove it in for the man to\r\nmilk. But my only morning duty was to pick a golden poppy or a\r\ncherokee rose or a handful of wild forget-me-nots for my button-\r\nhole. All day I sat in the sun, or drove a bit or walked a little\r\n--talking, talking, talking; of law, and Plato, and Epictetus, and\r\nHarry Lauder, (whom we imitated, at a distance; for my brother\r\nsings Scotch songs); and we talked too of our old girls and the\r\nearly days of good hunting in this semi-civilized land, and of\r\nWoodrow Wilson and H. G. Wells and Emerson and Henry George, and\r\nof Billy Emerson, the negro minstrel, and William Keith our great\r\nartist. And we planned houses, adobe houses, that should be built\r\nup above, over the manzanita bushes, and the swimming-pool that\r\nshould just naturally lie between the two live-oaks hidden behind\r\nthe natural screen of mountain laurel, but open clear up to the\r\nsun. Each night we closed with a round of songs, and maybe a hymn.\r\nAnd bed was early. Now wasn't that a good place to be?\r\n\r\nNot so very different in atmosphere from Hyde Park! But what would\r\nBroadway say of such a life! Oh, the serenity of it all, the\r\ndignity, the independence, the superiority over so much that we\r\nthink important. There one could get a sense of proportion, and\r\nsee things more nearly in their natural color and size. Truly, I\r\ncould have been religious if I lived in the country--and not been\r\ntoo hard driven for a living! (For one can't be anything good or\r\ngreat when pressed and bullied by necessity of any kind.)\r\n\r\nSo I grew in strength on the little ranch and unwillingly came\r\nback for treatment here, which was not half so good for soul or\r\nbody as to sit in the sun and see the birds daintily pick their\r\ncrumbs and know that the dog at my knee understood what I did not\r\ntell him.\r\n\r\nGive to the Ducal lady at Hyde Park my spring greetings, and to\r\nthe \"young lord lover\" who bears your name my respectful regards.\r\nI expect to go to Rochester, or elsewhere, in May, and in the\r\nmeantime think me not silly because I like you and have written of\r\nwhat I like.\r\n\r\nF. K L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John W. Hallowell\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, March 31, 1921\r\n\r\nDEAR JACK,--I went to your Church on Sunday. Now there! Real\r\nFriends. I wondered, \"Why the two doors?\" as I went up the steps,\r\nbut I said, \"I'll take the nearest.\" Someone was talking, so I\r\nplumped down in the backmost seat. Then I looked about and found\r\nthat I was faced by three rows of sisters, in poke bonnets on a\r\nraised platform, at the end of the room. Around me were women,\r\nwomen, women, and children. Not a man!\r\n\r\nMy wits at last came to me. I discovered there were two rooms\r\nreally, divided by pillars. And there were the men, the blessed,\r\nhomely men. So up I lifted hat and coat and piled over on the\r\nman's side and breathed again.\r\n\r\nThe speaker looked like the late Senator Hoar and was intoning or\r\nchanting his speech or address or sermon. I had never heard it\r\ndone and the cadence was charming. It adds to the emotionalism of\r\nwhat is said. When he sat down, there was a long pause, and then a\r\nsister, on the opposite side now, quoted, modestly, a psalm. Two\r\nmore, a man and woman, spoke. Then a prayer and at twelve, with\r\none accord, we all rose and went out.\r\n\r\nIt is the essence of Democracy and I fear the forward there, and\r\nnot the most worthy of being heard, come to the front. Please tell\r\nyour mother how good I was! And write me, you scoundrel!\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n Postcard to John G. Gehring\r\n\r\nApril 20, [1921]\r\n\r\nOn the eastbound train, traveling toward a little man who carries\r\na little knife in his hand and beckons me toward the north. I do\r\nnot go gladly, because I am feeling so much better. Have had whole\r\ndays and nights without pain, by the exercise of all kinds of\r\ncare. Still that is living \"on condition.\" Is there never again to\r\nbe freedom? You see I am a natural Protestant. Good luck to you,\r\ndear man.\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\nTo Hall McAllister\r\n\r\nR.R. Train, Minnesota, April 22\r\n\r\nDEAR HALL,--I am now on the St. Paul road going to Lake City,\r\nwhere, it is said my son is to be married to a charming, little\r\nIrish girl, one generation away from Ireland.\r\n\r\nRight now, I am sitting opposite Mrs. Franklin K. Lane who is, in\r\nturn, sitting beside my brother who has come East with me as\r\nsecretary, nurse, doctor, mentor, spiritual advisor, valet, and\r\ncompanion. On my right is the Mississippi river, of which you may\r\nhave heard. On Sunday I hope to go to Rochester again and then be\r\ncut in two, tho' I am not sure they will do it.\r\n\r\nI left California last Tuesday. It was quite pleased with itself\r\nand full of pity for all the rest of the world. It surely has much\r\nto say for itself, and says it with frequency and normalcy. The\r\nonly disappointment in dying will be the unfortunate contrast--eh,\r\nyou Californian? But then you and I are not like those\r\ntransplanted Iowans who fill Southern California, most of whom\r\nhave never seen Mt. Tamalpais nor the Golden Gate and yet think\r\nthey know California!\r\n\r\nI look at the paper and see \"Harding\" at the top of every column.\r\nThen I think of W. W. looking at the paper and seeing the same\r\nheadlines. Oh, what unhappiness! Not all the devices of Tumulty\r\nfor keeping alive illusions of grandeur could offset those\r\nheadlines. Ungrateful world! Un-understanding world!\r\n\r\nI hope you like your new boss. He will be a good western\r\nSecretary, and is quite likely to get into a row with our eastern\r\nconservation friends. I am glad he is from the Senate, they care\r\nfor their own.\r\n\r\nI don't like Harrison jumping on Harvey after confirmation. Looks\r\nlittle, weakens his influence as \"our\" man, and is not\r\nsportsmanlike. We must take our medicine and let Harding have his\r\nown way, and it won't be such a bad way, but surely very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n... I should like to get back to Washington and loaf for a time\r\naround Sheridan Circle. I know a woman there who intrigued me (as\r\nyou writers say) long, long ago with various fascinations of\r\nspirit and mind and eye and voice. But I fear she would not know\r\nme any more.\r\n\r\nNow do not be discouraged because you have a bit of sickness. You\r\nare youth, you can beat old whiskered Time. Life has many a laugh\r\nin it yet for you. Why you look forty years younger than Joe\r\nRedding--but don't tell him I told you.\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Frederic Peterson\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, April 26, [1921]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR MRS. PETERSON,--... Once more I am going through the\r\ngrinding of the Mayo mill, and this time I hope to some concrete\r\npurpose, and have an end to this coming out \"by that same door\r\nwherein I went\" The dear old meditative, contemplative Orientals\r\nthrew up their hands in despair long years ago and found the\r\nfigure of the unending wheel to symbolize all processes and\r\nprocedures: a world, a universe, without termini. Sometimes I\r\nthink them right, but then again my western mind will not have it\r\nthat the riddle of the Sphinx may not be solved. Our assurance\r\nmeets every challenge; mystery may make us humble; we may be\r\nbaffled; but we do not despair because we know we are Gods to whom\r\nall doors must open eventually. That seems to be the real\r\nunderlying strength of our position. Why men go on with research\r\nexcepting out of some such philosophy I cannot see--nor why they\r\ngo on with life.\r\n\r\nTell your good man that I long to look once more into the sweet\r\nface of the Shepaug, and that while I have been wandering in the\r\ndelicious and rare places, I have not forgotten the fresh\r\nwholesomeness of the Hoosatonic. My first visit shall be to the\r\nmeeting place of the Three Rivers. Why might not fortune lead us\r\nto have a summer in Connecticut and a winter in California? \"I\r\nknow a place where the wild thyme grows,\" many such places indeed,\r\nand high hillsides of wild lilac and a wee mountain crowned with\r\nthe flowering manzanita. Oh, this world is a place to make souls\r\ngrow if one can get an apple tree, a pine and an oak, a few\r\nlilies, a circle of crimson phlox, a stretch of moving water and a\r\nsweep of sky, that can be called one's own.\r\n\r\nWe saw Cordy Severance's place on Sunday--went there from the\r\nwedding of my boy to Catherine McCahill--and found a volume of the\r\nChinese Lyrics [Footnote: By Dr. Frederic Peterson.] in the big\r\nroom. Great chap Cordy, and a great room he has to play the organ\r\nin, and more people love him than anyone else I know, for he loves\r\nthem with an aggressiveness that few men dare to show, that gives\r\nhim distinction and is a glory.\r\n\r\nHow far away the war seems--way back yonder with the fight for\r\nIndependence and the French Revolution, almost back to Caesar.\r\nWell, I must quit mental meanderings. With all good will,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Roland Cotton Smith\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, [April] 30\r\n\r\nAnd you know that I cannot even write Spoon River! Vain man!\r\nStrutting cock o' the walk! Knight of the Knickerbocker Club!\r\nGazer upon Fifth Avenue and the Foibles and Frivolities! Reveller\r\nin things of life and Enjoyer of Gaiety!\r\n\r\nLook thou upon me. To Minnesota driven. In a hospital-hotel.\r\nPunched and tapped by every stray Knight of the Golden Fleecers.\r\nAwaiting a verdict from puzzled doctors. ... Bless you, I have\r\nbeen through years of watchful waiting but not of this kind, and a\r\nfew weeks of this is enough. But I am a patient, long-suffering,\r\nChristian martyr upon whom the Pagans work their will.\r\n\r\nAnd you, poor man. Tied to a woman's foot! Now that is what I call\r\nhumiliating. Worse than being tied to her apron strings or to her\r\nchariot, (in the latter, they say, there is often much joy.) Why\r\nshould people have feet anyway in these days of autos? A mere\r\ntransportation convenience! Well, all our transportation\r\nfacilities seem to be out of order these days. Fallen arches, in\r\nsooth! Reminds one of Rome. Very much more aristocratic than\r\ninfected gall-bladder after all. And I do hope they can be\r\nrestored, those arches, and the world once more put on its\r\nperipatetic way.\r\n\r\nBut you do not tell me of yourself. Can you chop wood or saw wood\r\nor play golf or do aught else that doth become a man of muscle,\r\nenergy, life, vim, go, pep? Take a trip to the South Seas, a\r\nknock-about trip, casting off clerical garb and living in the\r\nopen, mixing with the primitive peoples, seeing beauteous nature,\r\nclimbing mountains, swimming in soft waters, not seeing newspaper\r\nor book. They tell me that in Burmah live a happy people who love\r\nbeauty, are always smiling and follow the Golden Rule far nearer\r\nthan those who live by trade and are blest by civilization. Ah,\r\nthat I might see such a people! The nearest I ever came was at\r\nHonolulu, and there was the taint of the Christian, alack-a-day!\r\nThe White Man's Burden is the weight of the load of sin, disease,\r\ndeath, and misfortune he has dropped on the happy ones who never\r\nknew a Christian creed. We have given them bath tubs in exchange\r\nfor cheerful living!\r\n\r\nI am as much in the air as to the future as I was in the russet\r\ndays of Bethel. But one of these days, let us hope we may gather\r\nover a bottle of something sound and mellow, and laugh together\r\nover our adventure into the land of the woebegone. I do not take\r\nto it, tho' they say some people live in it by choice, for they\r\nfind something to talk of there, and feel saintly because they\r\nsuffer. Well, we will have more knowledge in that happy future and\r\nmore of sympathy. What a lot one must endure to gain a wee bit of\r\nwisdom. And then to have it die with us. Maybe it does not, eh?\r\nMaybe it somehow, somewhere finds a corner into which it drops and\r\ncarries someone over a hard place. I don't know what kind of\r\ntheology this is that I am dripping from my pen, but I cannot yet\r\nbe beaten to the point where I say it is all purposeless. And that\r\nis the faith that may not save a soul but does save souls, I\r\nguess.\r\n\r\nI wish you the joy and elevation of spirit that you have many\r\ntimes given to my sick soul and to others. Did I tell you my boy\r\nis married--to a Catholic girl too, of much charm? They were\r\nmarried on the ancestral farm with the ancestor of ninety years\r\npresent and in high spirits. A Dios, Padre mio,\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John G. Gehring\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, [April] 30, [1921]\r\n\r\nTomorrow will be May day--once, before the world became\r\nindustrial, a day of gladness, now a day of dread, another result\r\nof mal-adjustment.\r\n\r\nWhat ever would these doctors do if they had no cheeks in which to\r\nhold their tongues while telling sick folk what ails them, and the\r\ncure? You are learning, Sir, how much of wisdom some men lack who\r\nhave certain knowledge. And wisdom is what we are after, we\r\nKnights of the Mystic Sign. Wisdom--the essence of lives lived;\r\nknocks, blows, pains, tortures reduced to fears, and these\r\nincorporated into a string or queue of people who have eyes,\r\nnerves, and powers of inference, and the initiative to experiment\r\nand the impulse to try, and try again. Result--a nugget no larger\r\nthan a mustard seed of intellectual or spiritual radium, y-clept\r\nwisdom. It does not grow on ancestral trees or on college\r\ncampuses, nor does it come out of laboratories or hospitals, tho'\r\nit is sometimes found in all these places. A Carpenter is known to\r\nhave possessed more of it than any other man; tho' most of us\r\ndon't possess enough wisdom to know that He did possess so much of\r\nit. An Indian Prince is also celebrated for the richness of his\r\nsupply. These men have been followed by others who sometimes\r\ncarried mirrors, but some had tiny grains of the real thing also.\r\nAnd those are called Optimists and Transcendentalists and\r\nIdealists and Fools who think that more and more of these grains\r\nwill come into the hearts and minds of men; while those are called\r\nsensible, and shrewd, and sane, who assert that the supply is\r\nuniform, stationary in quantity but moved about from time to time,\r\nproducing nothing but the illusion that something is worth while.\r\n\r\nBut you and I say, \"Suffer the Illusion to come into me, for of\r\nsuch is the Kingdom of Heaven.\" Emerson says each man is an\r\n\"inlet\" of the Divine Spirit--just a bit on the side, out of the\r\ninfinite ocean. Thus all of us are connected up, and thus there is\r\nhope that some day doctors will be wiser than today. ...\r\n\r\nI should like to hold your hand for a time. It's the best service\r\none man can give another. We are great hand-holders, we men,\r\nnatural dependents, transfusers of sympathy and understanding and\r\nheartening stuff. They tell me here that your blood for purposes\r\nof transfusion is 1, 2, 3 or 4. The last is common denominator\r\nblood and will go into anyone safely, but is uncommon. All the\r\nother three will kill if not put into those of corresponding\r\nquality of blood. Well, you and I like each other because we have\r\nthe same wave-length to our nerve current, perhaps, and we could\r\nhold hands without danger to the other fellow, and possibly with\r\nsome benefit to the world,--for human sympathy makes good\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nGood fortune betide you! My brother, who is sitting by, wishes his\r\naffectionate regards to go with mine, and he hopes you will some\r\nday see him in that vale of Paradise where he lives.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\nTo Adolph C. Miller Federal Reserve Board\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, May 1, [1921]\r\n\r\nMay Day, Glad Day, Day of Festival and Frolic,--once. Now Day of\r\nPortent, of Threats and the Evil Eye. Such is the miracle worked\r\nby Steam Engine, Mechanics, Quick Exchanges, Industry!\r\n\r\nWith this happy opening let me to your letter in which you love me\r\na little, which I very much like, calling me baby,--child,\r\nanyway. And so I am. I laugh at myself. I cannot think of myself\r\nas Grandad or possible Grandad. In fact, I should not be Grandad\r\nor Dad, notwithstanding the beauty and noblemindedness and\r\ncapacity of my dear kids. But I have always been a priest, married\r\nto things undomestic, and without the time which every father\r\nshould have to train and educe the mind of his offspring;\r\nespecially to give sound and substantial bread and meat to their\r\nsubconscious mind when they are young. Then, too, a father should\r\nhave a religion, a sense of relation between himself and the\r\nMaster, and be able to instill this by gentle and non-didactive\r\nmethod into his bairns, so that they may steer by the North Star\r\nand not by shiftier, flashier stars.\r\n\r\nYes, altho' I am now tottering, bruised, battered, down on the\r\nfloor like a prostrate prize-fighter \"taking the count\" and hoping\r\nfor strength enough to rise, altho' an \"aged man\" as I was once\r\ndescribed in my hearing, I am the youngest thing inside that I\r\nknow; in my curiosity and my trustfulness and my imagination, and\r\nmy desire to help and my belief in goodness and justice. I want to\r\nstrike right out now and see the world, and having found the good\r\nbring it back and distribute it. And I see every day things that\r\nshould be done which make me long to live, even tho' I only tell\r\nothers that they should be done. And one thing that bothers me\r\nright now is our money scheme. I know I am far off from your\r\nstandpoint, but there is something wrong when there is so great a\r\nvariation in the purchasing power of things produced. Why is not\r\nIrving Fisher on the right road? I should like to lay a quieting\r\nhand upon the feverish desire for things which so possesses our\r\npeople. So few things will do, rich, beautiful, solid things, but\r\nnot many; and then to live with them, proud of them, revelling in\r\nthem, and making them to shine like well-handled bronze--not\r\nglossily but deeply. The great luxury we will not allow ourselves\r\nis repose; that is because we are not essentially dignified. The\r\nsoul is not respected sufficiently; it is not given that food on\r\nwhich it grows. Curious, the turn of my mind now, too. Having been\r\nthinking, and while I still am thinking, in large terms,--the\r\ncity, the state, the nation, all peoples (I have grown through\r\nthem all, never really thinking of the family unit)--I am now\r\nthinking of a nest, a roof of my own, a bit of garden, a tree of\r\nmy planting--little things, indeed, on which the mind can rest,\r\nafter casting an eye over the world and talking in terms of\r\ncontinents. (And I wonder if the gardens of the British--their\r\nweek-ends at home with flowers and birds, may not bring them down\r\nto those little things which make for good sense, sanity, wisdom!)\r\nBut I fear me I may never so indulge myself, and that is wrong--\r\nthat a man should live for fifty-seven years and never thrust his\r\nhand into his own bit of his country's soil--such condition makes\r\nagainst loyalties that are essential.\r\n\r\nNow I have talked with you for a long time, but not long enough.\r\nHow I should like to sit in the big re-upholstered chair beside\r\nthe lamp, beyond the fire, and throw a match into your brain stuff\r\nthat would start it blazing. Yes, and I would like to gather\r\naround that fire a few whom I love. You and Aleck and Sid. and\r\nPfeiffer and Jack Hallo well and John Burns and Brydon Lamb and\r\nLathrop Brown and Cotton Smith and John Finley and Dr. Gehring and\r\nJohn Wigmore--the real world is very small, isn't it?\r\n\r\nIt just may be that the verdict here will be one of exile to\r\nCalifornia, to my brother George's farm; ah, yes he should be with\r\nthe few great, and I say 'exile' for I wonder if I should ever see\r\nany of you then? My doctor in Pasadena said that I should live as\r\na country gentleman, and I answered, \"But that takes money.\" Yet I\r\nwould not know where the farm should be, for climate is not all.\r\nSo long, old man.\r\n\r\nF.K.\r\n\r\nMany months later, writing to Mrs. Lane this friend of many years\r\nsays, \"I want also to recall the remark Frank made when you and\r\nMary, and he and I, were rain-bound in the little chalet at St.\r\nMary's in Glacier Park, nine years ago. That was an outstanding\r\nexperience in my long friendship with Frank. We had many hours to\r\ndiscuss things, and no matter on what road we started, we always\r\ncame back to a discussion of life; what it was all for, and what\r\nit was about, and what principle a chivalrous man should take in\r\nadjusting himself usefully to the going world. I remember late one\r\nnight we sat in the dimly lighted room after a long discussion, he\r\narose, and turning to me said: 'Doesn't it, after all, just come\r\nto this,--To spend and to be spent--isn't that what life is?'\r\nEvery subsequent experience with Frank confirmed me in the belief\r\nthat that was his personal philosophy. That is why he lived\r\ngreatly while he lived, and died nobly when his life was spent.\"\r\n\r\n To Robert Lansing\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, May 2, [1921]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LANSING,--I am to be operated on on Friday and so send you\r\nthis line that you may know that I have yours of April sixteenth,\r\nand have rejoiced very much at its good news, that you were\r\nbetter, and that you were not bitter because of the come-back\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nReally, I think Harding is doing well, or rather that the whole\r\nadministration is being supported well by the country. Oh, these\r\nRepublicans have the art of governing, and we do so much better at\r\ntalking! No one knows just what his foreign policy is, but\r\nsomething will work through that will satisfy a very tired people.\r\nThere seem to be comparatively few out of work now. We are not out\r\nof the woods yet. But the Lord will take care of them. He may even\r\nkeep Johnson from bolting Harding. They will temporize through;\r\nthat's my guess.\r\n\r\nGood English the people don't know. Ideality they have had enough\r\nof for a time. They just want to get down to brass tacks and make\r\nsome money, so that the Mrs. can have more new dresses. I do\r\nearnestly wish them luck. God gave us the great day, and you and\r\nI, anyway, are not ashamed of the parts we played. In fact, the\r\nparty loomed pretty large those days--the whole country breathed\r\nlung-fuls and felt heroic. We shall not look upon such another\r\ntime nor act for a people so nobly inspired.\r\n\r\nPlease give to Mrs. Lansing my very best regards--fine spirit,\r\nthat she is--and to you, as always, dear Lansing, my affection and\r\nesteem.\r\n\r\nLANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo James D. Pkelan\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, May 2, 1921\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JIM,--Glad to hear from you and to get so cheerful a word,\r\nfor surely you are justified in looking upon the world as very\r\nmuch of a friend of yours. You have a rare home, in which to\r\ngather your many friends, and you have had honors in abundance,\r\nand now may rest and write and speak and adjust yourself to\r\nthings--terrestrial and celestial--and other service will call\r\nyou. There must be some Democrats appointed to adjust European or\r\nother difficulties, even by a Republican, and you will be the\r\nprominent one. So I can look across the mountains to Montalvo and\r\nfind you ripening into a fine old mellow age, conscious of\r\nusefulness, in health and in happiness. May it be so!\r\n\r\nJust as soon as my boy gets here, I shall be operated on. ... Ned\r\nis now on his honeymoon with his darling little bride, a Catholic\r\nIrish girl named Catherine McCahill, whose grey-whiskered\r\ngrandfather of ninety quite took the shine off the bride at the\r\nwedding. He is a Democrat (State Senator for thirty years) a Sinn\r\nFeiner of the most robust sort, and a fanner of many acres.\r\n\r\nPoor Anne, she is in for a bad time, with Nancy sick, but she has\r\na good stout heart and a most adequate and comfortable religious\r\nfaith, which throws things that are personal into a very minor\r\nplace. The theory of relativity has more than one expression\r\nindeed, and things are small when looked at from a height. And it\r\nis good to find one who can be both religious and large.\r\n\r\nThe country seems to be liking Harding and his cabinet more and\r\nmore. They do have a faculty for getting things done, those\r\nRepublicans, and they are subjected to so little criticism. It is\r\nreally good to see them do their work and get away with things so\r\nneatly. ... As always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mr. and Mrs. Louis Hertle Gunston Hall on the Potomac\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, May 2\r\n\r\nDEAR PEOPLE,--What good angel ever put it into your heart to wire\r\nus--and such a warm electric message!\r\n\r\nI tell you this is not Gunston Hall--so few birds, flowers, trees\r\n--but I like the great sweep of the sky out here. There is nothing\r\nmean about this land of ours. It gives you something, and gives it\r\nto you generously, something lovable wherever you are.\r\n\r\nThe Doctors have not decided what to do with me. ... But we'll be\r\nout of suspense this week, I expect.\r\n\r\nI can see your garden now--fountain, hedge, roses, bird-boxes,\r\npergola, box and all--with the dignified, stately Potomac way out\r\nyonder, beyond the cleared fields and the timber. Lucky people,\r\nand you deserve it all. No one, not even the Bolsheviks, would\r\ntake it from you. Cordially yours always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Alexander Vogelsang\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, May 4, 1921\r\n\r\nDEAR ALECK,--I must pass under the knife, that is the verdict. On\r\nFriday morning the act takes place. And out will come gall-\r\nbladder, adhesions, appendix and all things appertaining thereto,\r\nincluding hereditaments, reversions, lives in posse, and\r\nsinecures. So that's that!\r\n\r\nThey say that my heart has grown much worse in the last three\r\nmonths, but that I probably have four chances out of five of\r\npulling through, which is more chance than I ever had in politics\r\nin California. I believe I am to be operated on while conscious,\r\nas they fear to give ether. I trust my curiosity will not\r\ninterfere with the surgeon's facility.\r\n\r\nAh well, this old shell is not myself, and I have never felt that\r\nthe world's axis was located with reference to my habitat. But\r\nthis is so interesting an old world that I don't want to leave it\r\nprematurely, because one does run the risk of not coming upon one\r\nequally interesting. So I shall think of you and try to see you\r\nlater, in the new offices in the Mills Building. May clients come\r\nthick as dogwood in Rock Creek Park; and trout streams in hidden\r\nplaces be revealed unto you, within an hour's flight by aero.\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nP. S. Give my regards to the boys with you and in the office, when\r\nyou see them--and to Wade Ellis and Ira Bennett and others who may\r\nbe interested. Love to your dear Lady!\r\n\r\nTo John Finley New York Times\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, May 4, [1921]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR FINLEY,--I have your postal from London and it cheereth\r\nme--Yea, thou hast done a kindly act to one who is sore beset. ...\r\n\r\nWhen you and I can talk together I want to urge a new field upon\r\nyour great paper. Perhaps you can take it up with Mr. Ochs and\r\nperhaps he can see how he can add to his usefulness and to the\r\nglory of his paper's name.\r\n\r\nMy thought is that there should be somewhere--and why not in New\r\nYork?--a Place of Exchange for the New Ideas that the world\r\nevolves each year, a central spot where all that is new in\r\nscience, philosophy, practical political machinery, and all else\r\nof the world's mind-products shall be placed on exhibition where\r\nthose interested may see. Why should not the Times do this?\r\n\r\nIt would cost very little. All the plant needs would be a building\r\nwhich would contain one or two fine halls for public speaking, and\r\na few properly appointed apartments. No faculty--but a super-\r\nuniversity with all the searchers and researchers, inventors,\r\nexperimenters, thinkers of the world for faculty. No students--but\r\nevery man the world round interested in the theme under\r\nconsideration, welcome, as student without pay. The only executive\r\nofficer a Director, whose business would be to see that the great\r\nminds were tapped,--a high class impresario, who would know who\r\nhad thought thoughts, developed a theory, found a new problem, or\r\na new method of solving an old one, and [would] bring the thinker\r\non the stage and present him to those who knew of what he talked;\r\nand could intelligently, quickly, distribute it to the ends of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nMoney? The lecturer would get his expenses from his home and back\r\nagain, and be cared for appropriately in one of the apartments.\r\nOtherwise the incidental expenses of administration. Aside from\r\nthe single and simple building the whole thing should not cost\r\nmore than $100,000 a year.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate--it took years for the world to know what Rutherford\r\nwas doing with radium. Why should he not have been brought to some\r\ncentral place and there, before all the students who might choose\r\nto come, tell his story? Pasteur, Einstein, Bergson, Wright\r\nBrothers, Wells (theory of Education). These names are suggestive.\r\nThe great of the world could walk, as it were, in the groves with\r\ntheir pupils and critics, and we could have a new Athens. Whatever\r\nprogress the world had made, in whatever line, would be reported\r\nat that time. And the world would know in advance that this was to\r\nbe so. Germany has been the world thought center for forty years.\r\nEngland is now planning to take Germany's place. Why not America?\r\nBut the government has not the imagination, and this must be done\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nWhy not the Times? And why shouldn't you start it for the Times--\r\nbe the first Director?\r\n\r\nThen I want someone to take over another of my ideas--a sort of\r\nFederal Reserve Board on the good of the nation, an unofficial\r\ngroup of men with foresight, who would be a spur to government and\r\nsuggest direction. Somebody whose business it would be to attend\r\nto that which is nobody's business and so waits, and waits, until\r\nsometimes too late. Why should we have had no plans for caring for\r\nour soldiers as to employment and giving them the right bent on\r\ntheir return?\r\n\r\nThere was no one to concentrate attention--the attention of\r\nCongress and the public--on any definite plan. I tried it with my\r\nscheme for making farms for soldiers, but Congress, as soon as it\r\nfound that I was really agitating, passed laws making it\r\nimpossible for me to use a sheet of paper or the frank for the\r\npurpose. I do not say my plan was the best possible. Then someone\r\nshould have come forward with another, and pushed it against a\r\nCongress made up of Republicans who feared that Democrats would\r\nget the credit, and Democrats who feared Republicans would. Hence,\r\ndeadlock, and a great opportunity lost! ...\r\n\r\nSeers, or see-ers, that's what these men should be. Elder\r\nStatesmen, if you please, independent, away above politics.\r\n\r\nDoesn't it seem to you that we are coming to be altogether too\r\ndependent on the President? That office will be ruined. Every one\r\nwith a sore thumb has come into the habit of running to the\r\nPresident. This is all wrong, all wrong. He cannot do his job well\r\nnow. And he is only nominally doing it, and only nominally has\r\nbeen doing it for years. But each month seems to add to his duties\r\nas arbiter of everything from clothes to strikes, from baseball to\r\ndisarmament.\r\n\r\nI see a tremendous field for a body of a few ripe minds who would\r\ntalk so little, and so wisely, and so collectively, that they\r\ncould get and hold the ear of the country, governmental and\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nI outlined for Mezes, in your old job, a series of lectures by\r\nAmericans who have done things on Why America is Worth While--and\r\nhe has expanded it into a whole course on America, so that I\r\nbelieve he will have something new and great--teaching history,\r\ngeology, art, everything, by the history of that thing in America,\r\nand how it came to come here, or be here, or what it means here.\r\n\r\nWell, I have written you a book and must stop--I don't know where\r\nto address you but will send this to the Times. Please remember me\r\nto Mr. Ochs--who can see things, and here's hoping it won't be\r\nlong before we meet. Yours always,\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN K. LANE\r\n\r\nTo James H. Barry San Francisco Star\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, May 5, [1921]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR JIM,--I have nothing of importance to say, except that I\r\nam to be operated on tomorrow and hope for the best, for Dr. Will\r\nMayo is to do the operating, and I am not in a very run-down\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nI find myself quite serene, for I can look forward even to the\r\nvery worst result with the feeling that there is no one to meet me\r\nover there to whom I've done any wrong. And while I haven't done\r\nmy best, my score hasn't been blank. I honestly believe I've added\r\na farthing or two to the talent that was given me.\r\n\r\nMy brother George is here, with his splendid philosophy and his\r\nScotch songs; and Ned, my boy, and his bride have just come back,\r\nso that Anne and I are very well content that things are just as\r\nthey should be. I go to St. Mary's Hospital where they have nuns\r\nfor nurses, and when time comes for recuperation I shall go to the\r\nnear-by estate of my old friend, Severance, the big St. Paul\r\nlawyer, whom I have known these thirty years.\r\n\r\nI hope, my dear old man, that you will find new occupation soon\r\nthat will give you use for your pen, and sterling love of justice.\r\nMy regards, sincere and hearty to your family, and my other\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nF. K. LANE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, May 5, [1921]\r\n\r\nJust because I like you very much, and being a very old man dare\r\nto say so, I am sending this line, which has no excuse in its\r\nnews, philosophy or advice; has no excuse, in fact, except what\r\nmight be called affection, but of course this being way past the\r\nVictorian era, no one admits to affections! I will not belittle my\r\nown feeling by saying that I have a wife who thinks you the best\r\nEastern product--and probably she'd move to strike out the word\r\n\"Eastern.\" At any rate, I think I should tell you myself that I am\r\nto be operated on tomorrow, by Dr. Will Mayo, and am glad of it.\r\nWe shall see what we shall see.\r\n\r\nI find myself quite serene about the matter, altho' I believe my\r\nheart is so bad that they fear giving ether and will keep me\r\nconscious if they can, applying only a local anesthetic.\r\n\r\nI'd like to have Anne's perfect sureness as to the future, but\r\nlacking it, I do not look forward with fear, even if the worst\r\nshould happen. I've never done a wrong to any man or woman or\r\nchild that I can now recall--but maybe my memory is failing.\r\n\r\nMy boy and his bride came back this morning--happy! Oh, so happy!\r\nAnd my \"best beloved\" brother who sings Scotch songs is here--a\r\ngreat philosopher whom you would deeply admire--and our friends\r\nthe Severances of St. Paul, thirty year-old friends, they come\r\nover tonight. So we will be a merry, merry company. I'd love to\r\nsee you and the gay Cavalier, but let us hope it won't be long\r\ntill we meet! Au revoir!\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo friends who had telegraphed and written urgently for news\r\n\r\nMay 11, 1921\r\n\r\nIt is Wednesday afternoon and I am now sitting up in bed talking\r\nto my good friend, Cotter. Until yesterday I did not clearly\r\nvisualize any one thing in this room and did not know that it had\r\na window, except that there was a place that noise came through,\r\nbut I did know that it had a yellow oak door that stared at me\r\nwith its great, big, square eye, all day and all night.\r\n\r\nLast Friday, you see, about ten in the morning, I took the step\r\nthat I should have taken months, yes, years ago. I was stretched\r\non a stiff, hard table, my arms were clamped down and in three-\r\nquarters of an hour I had my appendix and my gall bladder removed,\r\nwhich latter was a stone quarry and the former a cesspool. Today,\r\nmost tentatively, I crawled on to a chair and ate my first\r\nmouthful of solid food. But four days ago I managed to shave\r\nmyself, and I am regarded as pretty spry.\r\n\r\nI have seen death come to men in various ways, some rather novel\r\nand western. I once saw a man hanged. And I have seen several men\r\nshot, and came very near going out that way myself two or three\r\ntimes, but always the other fellow aimed poorly. I was being shot\r\nat because I was a newspaper man, and I should have been shot at.\r\nThere must be public concern in what is printed, as well as its\r\ntruth, to justify it. That is something that newspapers should get\r\nto know in this country. After the earthquake in San Francisco, I\r\nsaw walls topple out upon a man. And I have had more intimate\r\nglimpses still of the picturesque and of the prosaic ways by which\r\nmen come to their taking off.\r\n\r\nBut never before have I been called upon deliberately to walk into\r\nthe Valley of the Shadow and, say what you will, it is a great\r\nact. I have said, during the past months of endless examination,\r\nthat a man with little curiosity and little humor and a little\r\nmoney who was not in too great pain could enjoy himself studying\r\nthe ways of doctors and nurses, as he journeyed the invalid's\r\npath. It was indeed made a flowery path for me, as much as any\r\npath could be in which a man suffered more humiliation and\r\ndistress and thwarting and frustration, on the whole, than he did\r\npain.\r\n\r\nBut here was a path, the end of which I could not see. I was not\r\ncompelled to take it. My very latest doctor advised me against\r\ntaking it. I could live some time without taking it. It was a bet\r\non the high card with a chance to win, and I took it.\r\n\r\nI undressed myself with my boy's help, in one of the hospital\r\nrooms, and then arraying myself in my best suit of pajamas and an\r\nantique samurai robe which I use as a dressing gown, submitted\r\nmyself to being given a dose of dazing opiate, which was to do its\r\nwork in about fifteen minutes. I then mounted a chair and was\r\nwheeled along the corridor to the elevator, stopping meantime to\r\nsay \"adieu\" to my dear ones, who would somehow or other insist\r\nupon saying \"good-bye,\" which is a different word. I was not to be\r\ngiven the usual anesthetic, because my heart had been cutting up\r\nsome didos, so I must take a local anesthetic which Was to be\r\nadministered by a very celebrated Frenchman. I need not tell you\r\nthat this whole performance was managed with considerable eclat,\r\nand Doctor Will Mayo, probably the first surgeon of the world, was\r\nto use the knife; and in the gallery looking on were Doctor\r\nFinney, of Johns Hopkins, Doctor Billings, of Chicago, Doctor\r\nVaughan of the Michigan University, and others. On the whole, it\r\nwas what the society reporter would call a recherche affair. The\r\nlocal anesthetic consists of morphine and scopolamin. It is\r\nadministered directly by needle to the nerves that lead to those\r\nparticular parts which are to be affected by the operation. This I\r\nwatched myself with the profoundest interest. It was painful,\r\nsomewhat, but it was done with the niceness and precision that\r\nmake this new method of anesthesia a real work of art. I should\r\nthink that the Japanese, with their very rare power at embroidery,\r\nmight come to be past masters in this work. There were some\r\ninsertions very superficial and some extremely deep. Over the\r\noperator's head, there were a half dozen heads peering intently at\r\neach move he made, while the patient himself was free to lift his\r\nhead and look down and see just what was being done. I did not\r\ntest myself, as I should have, to see whether I was paralyzed in\r\nany part.\r\n\r\nJust when this performance came to a head, Doctor Mayo came in and\r\nsaid, \"Well, I am going in for something.\" I said, \"That's right,\r\nand I hope you will get it.\"\r\n\r\nHis statement did not conclusively prove confidence that he would\r\nfind the cause of my trouble by going in. ... I knew there could\r\nbe no such definiteness, but I said to myself, \"He will get it, if\r\nit's there.\"\r\n\r\nFor two days I had had knowledge that this operation was to take\r\nplace at this time, and my nerves had not been just as good as\r\nthey should have been. Those men who sleep twelve hours perfectly\r\nbefore being electrocuted have evidently led more tranquil lives\r\nthan I have, or have less concern as to the future. Ah, now I was\r\nto know the great secret! For forty years I had been wondering,\r\nwondering. Often I had said to myself that I should summon to my\r\nmind when this moment came, some words that would be somewhat a\r\nsynthesis of my philosophy. Socrates said to those who stood by,\r\nafter he had drunk the hemlock, \"No evil can befall a good man,\r\nwhether he be alive or dead.\" I don't know how far from that we\r\nhave gone in these twenty-four hundred years. The apothegm,\r\nhowever, was not apposite to me, because it involved a declaration\r\nthat I was a good man, and I don't know anyone who has the right\r\nso to appreciate himself. And I had come to the conclusion that\r\nperhaps the best statement of my creed could be fitted into the\r\nwords, \"I accept,\" which to me meant that if in the law of nature\r\nmy individual spirit was to go back into the great Ocean of\r\nSpirits, my one duty was to conform. \"Lead Kindly Light\" was all\r\nthe gospel I had. I accepted. I made pretense to put out my hand\r\nin submission and lay there.\r\n\r\n\"All through, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, we will proceed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd I was gradually pushed through the hall into the operating\r\nroom. The process there was lightning-like. I was in torture.\r\n\r\n\"Lift me up, lift me up.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have one of those angina pains and I must ease it by getting up\r\nand taking some nitro.\"\r\n\r\nThat had been my practice, but I did not reason that never before\r\nhad the pain come on my right side.\r\n\r\n\"Give him a whiff of ether.\" The tenderest arms stole around my\r\nhead and the softest possible voice--Ulysses must have heard it\r\nlong ago--\"Now do take a deep breath.\" I resisted. I had been told\r\nthat I would see the performance.\r\n\r\n\"Please do, breathe very deeply--just one good deep breath.\" That\r\npain was burning the side out of me. I tried to get my hand up to\r\nmy side. Of course it was tied down. I swore.\r\n\r\n\"Oh Christ! This is terrible.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will stop if you will reach for a big breath,\"--and I resigned\r\nmyself. Men who are given the third degree have no stronger will\r\nthan mine. I knew I was helpless. I must go through. I must\r\nsurrender to that Circean voice.\r\n\r\nI heard the doctor in a commonplace monotone say, \"This is an\r\nunusual case--\"--the rest of this sentence I never heard.\r\n\r\nThere was a long ray of gray light leading from my bed to my door.\r\nI had opened my eyes. \"I had not died.\" I had come through the\r\nValley.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what he got.\"\r\n\r\nIn the broad part of the ray was my wife smiling, and stretching\r\nout to that unreachable door were others whom I recognized, all\r\nsmiling. Things were dim, but my mind seemed definite.\r\n\r\n\"What did he get?\" I had expected eternal mysteries to be\r\nunraveled. Either I would know, or not know, and I would not know\r\nthat I would not know.\r\n\r\n\"He got a gall-bladder filled with stones and a bad appendix, and\r\nnow you are to lie still.\"\r\n\r\nThen to this the drama had come, the drama beyond all dramas--a\r\nhandful of brownish secretions and a couple of pieces of morbid\r\nflesh!! Ah me!\r\n\r\nI am doing well, cared for well, as happy as can be; have had none\r\nof my angina pains since the operation. And as I lie here, I\r\ncontemplate [making] a frieze--a procession of doctors and nurses\r\nand internes, of diagnosticians and technicians and experts and\r\nmechanics and servitors and cooks--all, the great and the small,\r\nin profile. They are to look like those who have made their\r\npretenses before me during the past year;--the solemn and the\r\nstupid; the kindly, the reckless; the offhand; the erudite, the\r\npractical; the many men with tubes and the many men with\r\nelectrical machines. Old Esculapius must begin the procession but\r\nthe Man with the Knife, regnant, heroic size, must end it.\r\n\r\nWhat a great thing, what a pride, to have the two men of greatest\r\nconstructive imagination and courage in surgery in the world as\r\nAmericans, Dr. Charles and Dr. Will Mayo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Alexander Vogelsang\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, May 14, [1921]\r\n\r\nThis is a line by my own hand, dear Aleck, just to show you that I\r\nam still this much master of myself. ...\r\n\r\nI am going through much pain. Inside I am a great boil. But Nature\r\nis doing all she can, and I am helping. They think me a right\r\nmodel sort of patient, for I made a showing of exceptional\r\nrecovery. When T.R. shaved the day after, I said, \"Hip Hip!\" Well,\r\nI done it too! I guess as how I haven't been so very bad a boy all\r\nthese fifty-seven years or I couldn't play as good as \"par\" at\r\nthis game, and they say they have no better record than mine on\r\nthe books.\r\n\r\nThe National Geographic Society did a nice thing. Today I got a\r\nresolution of the most sympathetic kind from them. Some gentlemen\r\nstill alive, eh?\r\n\r\nI dictated a bit of a thing about my experience the other day to\r\nCotter--something to send off to the chaps who wrote or wired--and\r\nsent you one. I hope it wasn't soft or slobby. Did you think it\r\nwas all right to come from a sick bed?\r\n\r\nIt will be three weeks or more yet of hospital, and then much of\r\nrecuperation. But I have no complaint. I feel a faith growing in\r\nme, and I may yet draw my sword in some good fight.\r\nAffectionately,\r\n\r\nFRANK\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo John W. Hallowell\r\n\r\nRochester, Minnesota, May 14, 1921\r\n\r\nDEAR JACK,--I've been down into the Valley since I heard from you,\r\nbut I'm up once more and with new light in my eye, new faith in my\r\nheart, more sense of the things that count and those that don't.\r\nAnd affection, love for the good thing of any kind; loyalty, even\r\nmistaken loyalty, these are the things that the Gods treasure.\r\nThey live longest. So I turn to give you my hand, dear boy,\r\n\r\n[Illustration with caption: LANE PEAK IN RAINIER NATIONAL PARK]\r\n\r\nI was most badly infected, but I really never felt better than\r\nwhen I stepped out of the auto on to the hospital steps. And it\r\ntook some nerve for me to say, \"Go to it,\" under such\r\ncircumstances. (I am patting myself on the back a bit now.)\r\n\r\nWell, Glory be!--that step is taken and now I must fight to get\r\nfit. They say I am making as good a record as a boy, as to\r\nrecovery, so all my Scotch whiskies, and big cigars and late\r\nnights with you politicians have not ruined me.\r\n\r\nSay dear things to your Mother for me, Jack, and give greetings to\r\nall your family.\r\n\r\nF. K. L.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Robert Lansing\r\n\r\nRochester, 14 [May, 1921]\r\n\r\nMY DEAR LANSING,--I am disturbed because you may be disturbed. As\r\nI lie in bed I read and am read to, and some of the papers do not\r\ntreat you decently. The very ones that were loudest in their\r\ndeclarations against W. W. at every stage, now suggest that you\r\nmight have quit his service if you didn't like it. I hope it will\r\nnot get under your skin ...\r\n\r\nWhat comfort you would have given the enemy if you had resigned!\r\nHave they thought of that? I came to the brink when the President\r\nblew up my coal agreement to save three or four hundred million\r\ndollars for the people, But I was stopped by the thought, \"Give no\r\ncomfort to Berlin.\" ... Good night and good luck.\r\n\r\nF.K.L.\r\n\r\nManuscript fragment written May 17, 1921, and found in his room.\r\nFranklin K. Lane died May 18, 1921.\r\n\r\nAnd if I had passed into that other land, whom would I have\r\nsought--and what should I have done?\r\n\r\nNo doubt, first of all I would have sought the few loved ones\r\nwhose common life with me had given us matter for talk, and whom I\r\nhad known so well that I had loved dearly. Then perhaps there\r\nmight have [been] some gratifying of a cheap curiosity, some\r\nsearching and craning after the names that had been sierras along\r\nmy skyline. But I know now there would have been little of that.\r\nIt would not have been in me to have gone about asking Alexander\r\nand Cromwell little questions. For what would signify the trifle\r\nwhich made a personal fortune, that put a new name up upon some\r\npilaster men bowed to as they passed? Were Aristotle there,\r\nholding in his hand the strings and cables that tied together all\r\nthe swinging and surging and lagging movements of the whole\r\nearth's life--an informed, pregnant Aristotle,--Ah! there would be\r\nthe man to talk with! What satisfaction to see him take, like\r\nreins from between his fingers the long ribbons of man's life and\r\ntrace it through the mystifying maze of all the wonderful\r\nadventure of his coming up. The crooked made straight. The\r\n'Daedalian plan' simplified by a look from above--smeared out as\r\nit were by the splotch of some master thumb that made the whole\r\ninvoluted, boggling thing one beautiful, straight line. And one\r\ncould see, as on a map of ocean currents, the swing and movements\r\nof a thousand million years. I think that I would not expect that\r\nhe could tell the reason why the way began, nor where it would\r\nend. That's divine business, yet for the free-going of the mind it\r\nwould lend such impulse, to see clearly. Thus much for curiosity!\r\nThe way up which we've stumbled.\r\n\r\nBut for my heart's content in that new land, I think I'd rather\r\nloaf with Lincoln along a river bank. I know I could understand\r\nhim. I would not have to learn who were his friends and who his\r\nenemies, what theories he was committed to, and what against. We\r\ncould just talk and open out our minds, and tell our doubts and\r\nswap the longings of our hearts that others never heard of. He\r\nwouldn't try to master me nor to make me feel how small I was. I'd\r\ndare to ask him things and know that he felt awkward about them,\r\ntoo. And I would find, I know I would, that he had hit his shin\r\njust on those very stumps that had hit me. We'd talk of men a lot,\r\nthe kind they call the great. I would not find him scornful. Yet\r\nboys that he knew in New Salem would somehow appear larger in\r\ntheir souls, than some of these that I had called the great. His\r\nwise eyes saw qualities that weighed more than smartness. Yes, we\r\nwould sit down where the bank sloped gently to the quiet stream\r\nand glance at the picture of our people, the negroes being\r\nlynched, the miners' civil war, labor's hold ups, employers'\r\nruthlessness, the subordination of humanity to industry,--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
